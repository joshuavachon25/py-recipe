PREFACE 

THE present work is based on the notes prepared by 
the writer for his class while teaching Public Health 
Chemistry and Bacteriology. These were compiled from 
various standard works, and from articles appearing in 
the medical journals from time to time. No originality 
is therefore claimed for them, and grateful acknowledg- 
ment is made to the sources indicated.* 

The book is intended to assist in, and supplement, 
actual laboratory teaching, and not in any way to super- 
sede it. It has been the writer's endeavour therefore to 
make it as complete as possible, while leaving out 
matters which can be more satisfactorily taught and 
demonstrated than written about. No illustrations have 
been introduced, as the various instruments and apparatus 
are seen and used in the actual work. 

I desire to express my hearty appreciation of, and my 
best thanks for, the assistance received from a number 



* I am especially indebted to the following works : Fakes' " Hygiene," 
Notter & Firth's " Hygiene," Moor & Partridge's " Aids to the Analysis 
of Foods and Drugs," Richter's " Organic Chemistry," the " Harmsworth 
Self-Educator," the " Encyclopaedia and Dictionary of Medicine and 
Surgery," Jordan's "Bacteriology," Muir & Ritchie's " Bacteriology," Hiss 
and Zinsser's " Bacteriology," Abel's " Laboratory Handbook," Stitt's 
" Practical Bacteriology," Sims Woodhead's " Bacteria and their Products," 
and the Lancet, Public Health, and the Bacteriological Supplement to the 
Medical Officer.

of friends, and very specially from Dr. R. M. Buchanan, 
Bacteriologist to the Corporation of 'Glasgow, and Dr. J. 
Hume Patterson, Bacteriologist to the County Council of 
Lanarkshire. To Dr. John A. Wilson, Assistant Bacteri- 
ologist, Glasgow, I owe a careful revision of the chapter 
on Special Bacteriological Examinations, including the 
Table on pp. 3545, and much helpful criticism. To Dr. 
Archibald MacMillan I am indebted for criticism of some 
parts of the Chemical portion of the book, as a result of 
which certain changes have been made.

PUBLIC HEALTH 
CHEMISTRY AND BACTERIOLOGY, 



INTRODUCTORY. 

PUBLIC HEALTH Chemistry and Bacteriology do not 
differ fundamentally from general chemistry and 
bacteriology, and in fact are based on these subjects, of 
which they are specialized departments. The same 
principles underlie the part as the whole, and the accumu- 
lation of scraps of knowledge derived from the parent 
sciences, under the heading of Public Health Chemistry 
and Bacteriology, is justifiable only on the score of con- 
venience and the importance of economizing the student's 
time. It is therefore necessary to remember that the 
whole is greater than the part, and that to have wide and 
luminous views of the subjects so designated, the study 
of them should not be strictly utilitarian, but be extended 
in ah 1 necessary directions as much as possible. 

A knowledge of Public Health Chemistry and Bacteri- 
ology has become more urgently called for, owing to the 
increase of Public Health work, to participate in which 
it is necessary to possess a Diploma in Public Health. 

The General Medical Council at their meeting on ist 
December, 1911, adopted in an amended form the resolu- 
tions and rules which form the Regulations for the Diploma 
in Public Health. These are printed in full in an Appendix 
to this volume. For our present purpose it is sufficient to 
quote here Rule 2. 

Rule 2. Every Candidate for a Diploma in Sanitary Science, 
Public Health, or State Medicine shall have produced satisfactory 
evidence that, after obtaining a registrable qualification, which 
should be registered before admission to examination for the 
diploma, he has received practical instruction in a laboratory or 



2 INTRODUCTORY 

laboratories, British or foreign, approved by the licensing body 
granting the diploma, in which chemistry, bacteriology, and the 
pathology of the diseases of animals transmissible to man are 
taught. 

Note . The laboratory instruction shall cover a period of not less 
than four calendar months, and the candidate shall produce 
evidence that he has worked in the laboratory for at least 240 hours, 
of which not more than one-half shall be devoted to practical 
chemistry. The laboratory course should be so arranged as to lay 
special stress on work which bears most directly on the duties of 
a medical officer of health. 

The amendments in this rule reduce the number of 
months of instruction from six to four, and define the 
hours worked as 240, of which at least 120 shall be devoted 
to Bacteriology. The net result is that students will 
thus require to do as a minimum 15 hours' practical 
laboratory work per week for four months. Many students 
will find it more convenient to do 12 hours per week for 
a so-called six months' term of 20 weeks. 

The final clause of the rule, namely, " The laboratory 
course should be so arranged as to lay special stress 
on work which bears most directly on the duties of 
a medical officer of health " might usefully have been 
made more specific, and been extended to include the 
phrase, " and the Examiners for the Diploma shall have 
special regard to this recommendation." 

The student will be well advised to exceed the minimum 
periods above laid down, as tar as he can, and more espe- 
cially if he is not already well informed in the subjects of 
chemistry and bacteriology. 

The scope of the work and the methods may be thus 
summarized on the basis of the Syllabus of the Scottish 
Conjoint Board : 

DIPLOMA IN PUBLIC HEALTH. 
PUBLIC HEALTH LABORATORY WORK COURSE 
comprises : 

Physical, Chemical, and Bacteriological Examination of 
water, sewage and sewage effluents, air and other gases, 
food stuffs, beverages, soils, and building materials. 
Examination of disinfectants, antiseptics, deodorants. 



3 

Detection of Poisons in foods, dress, decoration. 

Examination of parasites and other animal organisms 
found in the body and human food stuffs. 

Bacteriology and Bacteriological Methods : apparatus, 
media, modes of culture ; culture and recognition of the 
principal pathogenic organisms ; bacteriological examina- 
tion of water, air, and foods ; antitoxins ; principles 
of serumtherapy and immunization ; cultivation and 
recognition of micro-organisms in relation to epidemic and 
other diseases. 

MODES OF EXAMINATION. 

Physical. Inspection by the unaided senses colour, 
odour, taste, transparency, turbidity, etc. ; specific 
gravity ; microscopic examination ; spectroscopic examin- 
ation ; polariscopic examination. 

Chemical. Examination for proximate principles, e.g., 
water, solids, fat, sugar, etc. ; search for and identification 
of chemical impurities such as ammonia, lead, borax, etc. ; 
quantitative estimations of above. 

Bacteriological. Enumeration of bacteria present ; 
search for pathogenic forms ; if found, isolation and 
identification. 



PART I. 
PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY. 

IT is necessary, in the first place, to consider carefully 
certain points of chemical practice, which form the 
basis of much of the subsequent work, and which must 
be thoroughly understood to enable the latter to be 
readily followed and apprehended. 



CHAPTER I. 
CHEMICAL ANALYSIS. 

THIS is of two kinds Qualitative or Quantitative. 

i- Qualitative. Consists in proving the presence or 
absence of certain metals or salts, or generally of chemical 
elements or radicles or compounds in a substance or 
solution, by the use of a series of tests. 

2. Quantitative.- Consists in separating out the con- 
stituents of any composite body and accurately estimating 
the amount of each of them. This may be done in three 
ways : Gravi metrically, Volumetrically, Colorimetrically. 

Gravimetric method. The desired constituent is separated 
out in a known form, and this is accurately weighed. As a 
method it is often very complicated, very lengthy, and 
requires elaborate apparatus and much skill. 

Volumetric method. This consists in submitting the 
substance to certain characteristic reactions, a measured 
quantity of a solution of known strength being added 
until a change looked for occurs. From the quantity of 
reagent used, the amount of the substance found can be 
calculated by known chemical laws. It is less elaborate, 
much more quickly accomplished, needs simpler apparatus 
as a rule, is susceptible of great accuracy, and the skill 
required is less specialized. 

Colorimetric method. This consists in using a reaction 
which produces a coloured tint, which is compared with 
the tint obtained from the same treatment of a known 



6 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

quantity of the substance under investigation. Exact 
matching of the tints is arrived at, either by dilution of 
the stronger, or by putting up several standard tints. 
Requirements for Volumetric Analysis. 

1. Solution of reagent or test, the chemical power of 
which is accurately known ; this is called the Standard 
Solution. 

2. A graduated vessel, from which portions of the 
standard solution may be accurately delivered : the Burette. 

3. Some indication, unmistakeable to the eye, that the 
reaction is terminated or concluded : the Indicator. 

The process is called, a litration, i.e., an estimation of 
the titre or strength of a solution, and the person is said 
to titrate the solution. 

Volumetric methods may be classified thus : 

1. Neutralization of acids by alkalies, and vice versa 
acidimetry and alkalimetry. 

2. Reduction or oxidation of substances for example, 
ferrous sulphate titrated with potassium permanganate 
illustrates both actions. 

3. Precipitation of some insoluble and definite com- 
bination for example, precipitation of AgCl in testing 
for chlorides. 

STANDARD SOLUTIONS. 

A standard solution of any substance is made when a 
known quantity of that substance is dissolved in a known 
quantity of water. Then the strength can be expressed 
definitely as 

So many pounds per gallon, or pint, or ounce ; or 
grains or 

grammes per litre or cubic centimetre (c.c.) ; or 
milligrammes ,, ,, 

Thus we might have a standard solution of NaCl of these 
strengths : (i gallon = 10 Ibs. = 70,000 grs.). 

i Ib. per gallon ; then i fluid grain = o-i grain NaCl. 
i drachm per fluid ounce ; then i minim = 0-125 gr. NaCl. 
i gramme per litre ; then i cubic centimetre = o-ooi 
gramme, or i milligramme of NaCl per c.c. 



CHEMICAL ANALYSIS 7 

The metric system of weights and measures is found to 
be very convenient for such solutions, because 
i gramme dissolved in i litre i milligramme in I c.c. ; or 
n grammes dissolved in i litre = n milligrammes in i c.c. 

Standard solutions often have their strength expressed 
in terms of some other substance which they measure 
usually an elementary substance. For example 

AgNO 3 + NaCl - AgCl + NaNO 3 

17 (23 + 35'5)- 

From this equation we see that 170 parts of silver 
nitrate precipitate completely 58-5 parts of sodium 
chloride containing 35-5 parts of chlorine. If we wish 
to estimate the amount of Cl present in a solution of 
unknown strength, we can titrate with a solution of silver 
nitrate of known strength that is, a standard solution. 
What strength shall we make it ? 

a. 170 grm. AgNO 3 in i litre of water will precipitate 
35-5 grm. Cl; then i c.c. will precipitate 35-5 mgr. Cl. 

b. 17-0 grm. AgNO 3 in i litre of water will precipitate 1 
3-55 grm. Cl ; then i c.c, will precipitate 3'55 mgr. Cl. 

c. - = 4-78 grm. in i litre of water will precipitate 

i grm. Cl; then i c.c. will precipitate i mgr. Cl. 

The strength chosen depends on (i) The simplicity 
desired ; (2) The strength of solution to be tested ; 
(3) Whether any one of these strengths will be more 
useful than the others for other estimations, and so save 
needless duplication of solutions. 

- NORMAL SOLUTIONS. 

These are standard solutions made to a certain strength 
on the basis of chemical theory and practice. Thus, from 
the equation 

NaOH + HC1 = NaCl + H 2 O 

40 36-5 

we see that 40 parts of sodium hydrate are exactly neutral- 
ized by 36-5 parts of hydrochloric acid. If therefore we 



8 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

make a standard solution of NaOH 40 grammes to I litre, 
and one of HC1 36-5 grammes to i litre, then 

i c.c. stand, sol. NaOH = i c.c. stand, sol. HC1, 

and if we can build other solutions on the same plan, we 
shall have a whole range of solutions which are chemically 
equivalent c.c. for c.c. This will obviate having a strength 
of acid for titrating soda, another strength for potash, 
another for baryta, and so on, and reversely. This result 
is obtained, or rather attained, by using normal solutions, 
which are thus denned : 

A normal solution is one which contains in i litre of 
distilled water at 16 C. the hydrogen equivalent of the 
active reagent weighed in grammes, hydrogen being taken 
as one gramme. Such a solution is usually indicated by 

N 
the mark N or . If diluted, the degree of dilution is 

i 

indicated by a denominator, thus 

N N N N 



2 IO IOO IOOO 

which are respectively 
seminormal decinormal centinormal millinormal 

The hydrogen equivalent of a substance is found by 
taking its molecular weight, the number of atoms usually 
replaced by hydrogen, and the valency of these atoms. 
Divide the molecular weight by the product of the number 
of atoms and their valency. Thus 

NaCl m.w. =58-5 no. of replaceable atoms=i valency =i ; 
therefore 

N/i NaCl=58-5/ixi=58-5 grm. to i litre of water. 
Similarly 

HC1 m.w. =36-5 n.r.a. = i v. = i; hence 

N /i =36-5 grm. per litre. 

H 2 S0 4 m.w. = 98 grm. N/i =49 grm. per litre. 
HNO 3 m.w. = 63 N/i; = 63 
NaOH m.w. = 40 N/i=4O 
KOH m.w. = 56 N/i = 56 ,; 
Na 2 C0 3 m.w. = 106 N/i = 53 
K 2 C0 3 m.w. = 138 N/i =69 



CHEMICAL ANALYSIS 9 

Where the substance possesses molecules of water of 
crystallization, the weight of these must be added to the 
sum of the molecule proper, in order to arrive at the right 
figure for the normal solution. Thus 

H 2 C 2 O 4 +2H 2 O m.w. = i26 N 71=63 grm. per litre 
(oxalic acid). 

H 3 C 6 H 5 O 7 -)-H 2 O m.w.=2io N 71=70 grm. per litre 
(citric acid). 

H 2 C 4 H 4 O 6 m. w. = 150 N /i =75 grm. per litre 
(tartaric acid). 

HC 2 H 3 O o m. w. =60 N /i =60 grm. per litre 
(acetic acid). 

Some salts with enlarged molecules : 

Ferrous sulphate, FeSO 4 +7 H 2 O molecular weight =278 
Copper sulphate, CuSO d +5 H 2 O ,, =249 

Lead acetate, Pb(C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2 +3 H 2 O ,, ,, =379 

Sodium thiosulphate, Na 2 S 363+5. H 2 O ,, ,, =248 

The hydrogen equivalent of some reagents is not so 
easily arrived at ; for instance, potassium permanganate, 
variously written as 

K 2 Mn 2 O 8 and KMnO 4 . 

The molecular weight of the first formula is 316, and of the 
second is 158. Nevertheless, the normal solution is not 
158 grammes per litre, but is 31-6 grammes per litre. 
This is because potassium permanganate does not react 
as its formula might suggest as a manganate, but reacts 
as a double salt of potassium and manganese, as if it were 
written thus - 

K 2 O + Mn 2 7 , 

and in reaction the latter oxide is reduced and oxygen 
liberated ; thus 

K 2 Mn 2 8 + 3 H 2 S0 4 =K 2 S0 4 +2MnS0 4 +3H 2 0+50 

316 80 

We here see that 316 grammes of permanganate of potash 
liberate 80 grammes of oxygen, which are chemically 
equivalent to 10 grammes of hydrogen, and so 31-6 



10 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

grammes of the salt are equivalent to i gramme of 
hydrogen. Hence 

N/i KMnO 4 =31-6 grm. per litre. 
N/io do. = 3'i6 do. do. 
N/ioo do. -316 grm. do. 

Non-Standardized Solutions : 

Ammonia free water. 

Organically pure ammonia free water. 

Nessler's solution. 

Methyl-orange solution (i grm. per litre of water). 

Phenolphthalein solution (i % in 50 % alcohol). 

Starch solution (5 grm. per litre of boiling water). 

Baryta water (5 grm. of crystallized barium hydrate in 
i litre of freshly boiled distilled water. Stopper and set 
aside for three days, and decant off clear liquid. About 

o-5 %.) 

Metaphenylene - diamine (5 grm. per litre aq. dest. 
slightly acidulated with a few drops of sulphuric acid). 

Naphthylamine acetate in sulphanilic acetate : 

a. 3 to 4 grm. of sulphanilic acid dissolved in i litre 

of dilute acetic acid. 

b. frds grm. of naphthylamine are boiled with 150 

c.c. of aq. dest., the colourless liquid poured off 
and diluted to i litre with dilute acetic acid. 

c. Mix equal bulks as required for testing. 

Phenol-sulphonic acid (32 c.c. of pure concentrated 
sulphuric acid are added to 4 c.c. of pure phenol. Heat 
to 100 C. for 2 to 3 hours. Cool, and add no c.c. of 
distilled water). 

INDICATORS. 

These may be classified under two heads : 

(i) Neutrality indicators, which give a special reaction 
with acid or alkaline liquids, or with both ; (2) All others, 
such as starch, iodine, chromate of potash, permanganate 
of potash, and soap lather. 

Neutrality indicators are divided thus by R. T. 
Thompson : 



CHEMICAL ANALYSIS 11 

(i) Methyl-orange group : are most susceptible to 
alkalies ; methyl-orange, lacmoid, cochineal, congo-red ; 
(2) Phenolphthalein group : are most susceptible to acids ; 
phenolphthalein, turmeric ; (3) Litmus group : are inter- 
mediate in susceptibility litmus, rosolic acid, phenace- 
tolin. 

Sensitiveness. Phenolphthalein, lacmoid, rosolic acid, 
and phenacetolin showed change of colour with one-fifth 
quantity of acid or alkali required by methyl-orange and 
litmus ; that is to say, if the two latter required in 100 
c.c. of acid or alkali 0-5 c.c. to show change of colour, the 
former required only o-i c.c. 

Neutral point of one indicator does not coincide exactly 
with that of other indicators. Thus, saliva is generally 
neutral to litmus, alkaline to lacmoid or congo-red, and 
acid to turmeric. Fresh milk shows similar variations. 

1. Litmus solution is violet coloured. Acids change it 
to red ; alkalies to blue. 

In cold solution it may be used for the titration of 

Hydrates of soda, potash, ammonia, lime, baryta, etc. 
Nitric, sulphuric, hydrochloric, and oxalic acids. 
Arsenites and silicates of soda and potash. 

In boiling solution 

Carbonates and bicarbonates of K, Na, Ca, Mg, Ba. 
Sulphides of sodium and potassium. 

2. Methyl-orange is orange-brown in colour. Acids 
change it to pink ; alkalies to faint yellow. 

Only used in cold solution, and then for titration of 
Hydrates, carbonates, bicarbonates of K, Na, NH 3 , 

Ca, Mg, Ba, etc. 
Sulphides, arsenites, silicates, borates of K, Na, NH 3 , 

Ca, Mg, Ba, etc. 
All the mineral acids. 
Sulphites. 
Half the base in the alkaline and earthy alkaline 

phosphates and arseniates. 
NOT for organic acids, nor in presence of nitrous acid 

or nitrites, which decompose it. 



12 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

3. Phenolphthalein is colourless in solution. Acids cause 
no change in colour ; alkalies change it to purple-red. 

Used in the cold for titration of- 
Alkaline hydrates, except ammonia. 
Mineral acids. 
Organic acids (oxalic, tartaric, acetic, citric, and 

others). 
Carbonates to bicarbonates. 

May be used in alcoholic solutions, and hence for 
organic acids insoluble in water. Also for acids combined 
with bases, like morphia, quinine, brucine, etc., the organic 
base having no effect on it. 

. 4. Rosolic Acid is pale yellow in solution. With acids, 
unchanged ; with alkalies, violet-red. 
Good for mineral acids and oxalic. 
Not reliable for organic acids. 

5. Turmeric, yellow in colour. With acids, bright 
yellow ; with alkalies, reddish-brown. 

6 Lacmoid, blue and red papers are best form for use. 
These are an excellent substitute for methyl-orange when 
latter cannot be used. It is a derivative of resorcin, and 
is allied to litmus. 

The other indicators will be alluded to as their use is 
required. 

Rules as to use of indicators commonly employed : 
Methyl-orange for mineral acids. 
Phenolphthalein for organic acids. 
Litmus for organic acids in presence of free CO 2 (e.g. 
in beer). 

ALKALIMETRY AND ACIDIMETRY. 

Perform the following exercises : 

i. Titrate i c.c. 50 per cent NaOH diluted with a little 
water (distilled) with N/i H 2 S0 4 , using a few drops of 
litmus as indicator. 

Take the NaOH in a porcelain basin add the water and 
the litmus solution. Then take a burette and fill it with 
the normal acid solution ; be careful that the nozzle is 



CHEMICAL ANALYSIS 13 

full, and that the lowest part of the meniscus is opposite 
the zero mark. 

Now add the acid I c.c. at a time, stirring after each 
addition, with a glass rod. Continue the process until the 
colour of the solution changes to red. The result will be 
accurate to i c.c. With practice the end reaction can be 
judged more accurately ; but, as already mentioned, a 
certain quantity of acid is required for change of colour, 
and this is greater with litmus than with some other 
indicators. 

Say that 13 c.c. of N/i H 2 SO 4 were required. How 
much NaOH was present in the i c.c. of sample ? 

i c.c. N/i H 2 S0 4 =i c.c. N/i NaOH 

But N/i NaOH = 40 grm. per litre 

Then i c.c. N/i NaOH = 0-040 grm. 

Hence i c.c. N/i H 2 SO 4 = 0-040 grm. NaOH 
Then 13 c.c. ,, ,, = 0-52 grm. NaOH. 

But 13 c.c. were required to neutralize i c.c. of sample. 

Therefore i c.c. of sample contains 0*52 grm. NaOH, 
or 100 c.c. will contain 52 grm. NaOH. 

The discrepancy between 50 grm. in 100 c.c. and 52 grm. 
may be due to : 

(1) Inaccuracy in making the soda solution originally ; 

(2) Inaccuracy in measuring the i c.c. of soda solution ; 

(3) Inaccuracy in the strength of the normal acid 

solution ; 

(4) Inaccuracy in titration. 

2. Repeat the experiment, using i drop methyl-orange 
as indicator. 

3. Repeat the experiment, using i drop phenolphthalein 
as indicator. 

4. Titrate 5 c.c. 25 per cent H 2 SO 4 diluted with a little 
water, with N/i NaOH, using a few drops of litmus as 
indicator. 

5. Repeat" the experiment, using i drop methyl-orange 
as indicator. 

6. Repeat the experiment, using i drop phenolphthalein 
as indicator. 



11 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

Calculate out strength of solution by method similar to 
above. 

Thus, say that 25 c.c. of N/i soda are required to 
neutralize 5 c.c. of sample, said to be 25 per cent sulphuric 
acid. 

Then i c.c. N/i soda = or is chemically equivalent 

to i c.c. N/i sulphuric acid. 

But N/i H 2 SO 4 = 98/2 or 49 grm. per litre. 

Hence i c.c. ,, ,, = 0-049 grm. H 2 SO 4 
Hence i c.c. N/i NaOH = 0-049 S rm - H 2$O 4 
And 25 c.c. = 25 X 0-049 = 1*225 grm. 

H 2 S0 4 . 

But 25 c.c. N/i NaOH were required to neutralize 5 c.c. 
of sample ; therefore 5 c.c. of sample contain 1-225 g rm - 
of sulphuric acid, and 100 c.c. of sample contain 24-5 grm. 
of sulphuric acid ; that is, if 100 c.c. are taken as 100 grm., 
24*5 per cent. The sources of error are as before. 

WEIGHING AND MEASURING. 

Measuring of Solutions. Small quantities, like i c.c., 
2 c.c., etc., up to 25 c.c. or 50 c.c., are most accurately 
measured by pipette, or on some occasions by burette. For 
larger amounts, like 100 c.c., 250 c.c., 500 c.c., and 1000 c.c., 
flasks with a narrow neck and a mark thereon are the best. 
When extreme accuracy is not essential, the ordinary 
graduated measure is quite efficient. Be careful in pipet- 
ting certain liquids not to get any drawn into the mouth. 
Never pipette strong sulphuric acid or ammonia by mouth 
suction. 

On Weighing with the Chemical Balance. To weigh a 
certain quantity of a substance the necessary weights are 
placed in the right-hand pan of the balance. Some of the 
substance is then placed in the left-hand pan, or preferably 
in a watch-glass of known weight, or balanced by a similar 
one in the other pan. The handle or screw is now turned, 
and the balance put in action. If the pointer swings 
more on the side away irom the weights, that is more to 
the left side, the amount of substance is too little. The 
handle must now be turned down, and the balance thus placed 



CHEMICAL ANALYSIS 15 

at rest, before any further manipulations are tried. There- 
after more of the substance is added, and the same tech- 
nique carefully observed. 

To obtain the weight of a substance or dish, or both, these 
are placed in the left-hand pan, and a trial weight is put 
on the right pan. If this is too much, the next lower 
weight is tried, and so on, being careful to observe the 
technique outlined above. The weight is read from the 
vacant spaces in the case, and checked on removing the 
weights. Always use a watch-glass in weighing a salt or 
substance not contained in a vessel of some kind.

of the elements the older atomic weight, and that more 
recently assigned.

Volume and Density of Gases. All gaseous molecules, 
at the same temperature and pressure, occupy the same 
volume. This is another way of stating Avogadro's law, 
that " equal volumes of all gases (at a temperature suffi- 
ciently remote from their condensation-point the so-called 
permanent gases) at the same temperature and pressure, 
contain the same number of molecules." 

From this it follows, that if we know the volume occupied 
by one gaseous molecule at standard temperature and 
pressure, we thereby know the volume of all gaseous 
molecules at the same temperature and pressure. The 
volume occupied by the molecular weight of hydrogen, 
expressed as grammes, that is 2 grammes of hydrogen gas 
at C. and 760 mm. pressure, is 22-32 litres. Hence the 
statement, " the molecular weight of any gas, expressed 
in grammes, measures 22-32 litres, at standard temperature 
and pressure, that is, C. and 760 mm., or 32 F. and 
29-9 inches of mercury." 

The Crith. One litre of hydrogen gas at standard 
temperature and pressure weighs 0-0896 gramme. This 
weight has been called a crith. It follows from the above 
statement of Avogadro's law, that one litre of oxygen gas 
will contain the same number of molecules, each one 
16 times the weight of the hydrogen molecule (as 32 : 2), 
and hence the weight of one litre of oxygen gas will be 
16 criths, or 16 X 0-0896 grm. Similarly, one litre of carbon 
dioxide gas weighs 22 criths (as 44 : 2). The weight, there- 
fore, of one litre of an elementary gas (with exceptions) 
is equal to its atomic weight in criths ; and of one litre of 
a compound gas, is equal to half its molecular weight in 
criths. 

METRIC SYSTEM. 

The weights and measures of the metric system are 
those used nowadays in most Public Health work, although 
statements like " grains per gallon " still persist. The 
chief units employed are the following : 

Length. 

i metre = the length of a rod of platinum at the temperature 
of melting ice. This rod is kept at Paris, with official 
copies in the large towns. Equals 39-37 inches.

i centimetre = of a metre. 



i millimetre = 10 1 OU of a metre. 

i micron (p) = TTTOIT f a millimetre. 

i kilometre = 1000 metres. 

Mass. 

i gramme = the mass of i cubic centimetre of distilled 
water at the temperature of its maximum density, 4 C. 
or 39-2 F., i c.c. at 16 C. or 60-8 F. 0-9989 gramme. 
i gramme equals 1 5-432 grains. 

i decigramme = T V of a gramme. 

i centigramme = T ^ of a gramme. 

i milligramme = yoV^y f a gramme. 

i kilogramme = 1000 grammes. 

Volume. 

i litre = the volume or capacity of i kilogramme of distilled 

water at 4 C. Equals 35' 196 imperial fluid ounces. 
i decilitre = T L of a litre. 
i centilitre = T i^ of a litre. 
i millilitre = T7 Vo f a litre. 
i cubic centimetre = of a litre.

CHAPTER II. 
WATER ANALYSIS. 

THE examination of water samples is most commonly 
made to determine the presence or absence of evidence of 
sewage pollution. If the pollution is gross, the evidence 
of the unaided senses will cause its rejection. Few people 
would use, for domestic purposes water which was turbid, 
or contained suspended matter, or had a peculiar colour, 
or smelt badly, or had a disagreeable taste. Yet a water 
may have none of these characteristics, and still be 
dangerous or unfit for domestic use. Chemical analysis 
is then often of service in distinguishing good from bad 
waters. Except in the case of a poisonous metal, the 
analysis does not aim at finding things deleterious in them- 
selves, but the search is made for constituents which 
suggest the presence of deleterious or dangerous substances. 
In the case of sewage pollution, the latter are micro- 
organisms, and the former are those constituents of sewage 
which are readily detected, namely, chlorides from the 
urine, ammonia from the urea, and so-called albuminoid 
ammonia from any albuminous matter. As the average 
adult excretes 6 to 9 grammes of chlorine daily as chlorides, 
and i part of chlorine per 100,000 parts of water is easily 
estimated, the pollution produced by one day's excretion 
of urine into a water would thus be inferable from a rise 
of the chlorine content i per 100,000 even where the dilu- 
tion was into 600-900 litres or 120-180 gallons of water. 
The ammonia estimation is much more sensitive, a rise of 
i part in 50,000,000 being detectable. The urea excretion 
of an adult averages 33 grammes per day, and by the influ- 
ence of the micrococcus ureae this is changed to ammonium 
carbonate, thus : 

CO(NH 2 ) 2 + 2H 2 O = CO 3 (NH 4 ) 2 

60 96 

Hence, if 60 grammes of urea give rise to 96 grammes of 
ammonium carbonate, containing 34 grammes of ammonia, 
33 grammes of urea will give rise to the formation of 18-7 



20 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

grammes of ammonia, which diluted into 900,000 litres or 
200,000 gallons of water, would still have caused an appreci- 
able rise on the amount (if any) of ammonia already present. 
This illustrates the delicacy of some of these tests. 

Various other estimations are carried out, such as, to 
determine the presence or absence of poisonous metals, 
the degree of hardness, etc. These are usefully sum- 
marized thus :

and enumeration. 

(b) Additional.

5. Search for Bacillus enteritidis sporogenes. 

(c) Special procedures. 

6. Isolation of Bacillus typhosus from water. 

7. Isolation of Spirillum cholerae. 

COLLECTION OF SAMPLE. 

A fair average sample should be taken in a clean glass 
vessel with a glass stopper. In filling the vessel from a 
pond, lake, reservoir, or river, the mouth of it should be 
sunk two inches below the surface, and the vessel should 
be filled and emptied once or twice. If a surface specimen 
is wanted, then of course the sample will be so taken. 
When sampling water from a pipe or tap, unless the effect 
of the water on the pipes is under examination, the water 
should be allowed to run to waste for a few minutes before 
filling the vessel. 

The stopper should be tied in but not sealed. 

A convenient receiver is a Winchester quart bottle 
which holds half a gallon, and this is a suitable quantity 
for the usual analysis. 

Along with the sample, a written statement should be 
sent, giving full particulars as to mode of collection, place, 
time, recent meteorological conditions, reason why analysis 
is desired, etc., etc. 



22 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

The examination should be undertaken as soon as pos- 
sible, since changes take place on keeping. If delay is 
unavoidable, changes should be kept at a minimum by 
packing in ice. 

PHYSICAL EXAMINATION. 

Transparency. 

Suspended matter. 

Colour. Best, bluish or greyish ; greenish, from algae ; 
yellow or brown suspicious, except peaty. 

Taste. 

Smell. Place 250 c.c. in a glass-stoppered bottle. Put 
on water-oven at 30 C. for a few minutes. Remove 
stopper, and smell at once. 

Sediment. Let water stand for a few hours, pipette a 
few c.c. from bottom, centrifuge, mount a drop on a 
clean slide, and examine. The deposit may contain a very 
large number of things. 

1. Mineral matter, such as sand, clay, etc. 

2. Vegetable matter : (a) Living such as bacteria, 

yeasts, moulds, diatoms, desmids, rotiferai ; (b) 
Dead vegetable cells, husks of grain, cotton or 
linen fibres, starch granules. 

3. Animal matter : (a) Living such as ova, insects, 

worms, etc. ; (b) Dead such as hairs, scales, 
muscle fibre. 

CHEMICAL EXAMINATION. 

Reaction. Most drinking waters are alkaline in reac- 
tion. Upland surface water is often acid from humic and 
ulmic acids ; and this is important, as these acids dissolve 
lead. Sewage-contaminated waters usually retain their 
alkalinity. Waters polluted by refuse from chemical 
or dye works are sometimes acid in reaction. 

Dissolved Solids. The suspended matter is usually 
allowed to settle before testing for the solids in solution. 
The latter are estimated as total, fixed, and volatile. Also 
note, when igniting dried solids, presence or absence of 
fumes, odour, and charring. 

Total Solids. (i) Take a weighed platinum or porcelain 
dish of sufficient size ; (2) Add 100, 200, 250, 500, or 






WATER ANALYSIS 23 

1000 c.c. of water sample ; (3) Reduce bulk by moderate 
heat, avoiding boiling or spurting. Or, to a small dish 
successive quantities of the sample are added, a note being 
kept of the amount ; (4) Evaporate to complete dryness 
at 100 C. (212 F.) on water-bath ; (5) Now place in 
water-oven at 100 C. for half an hour to remove all traces 
of moisture. Some analysts advise this drying to be done 
at 105 C. in ho^-air chamber ; (6) Cool in dessicator ; 
(7) Weigh. To make quite sure that residue is dry, items 
5, 6, and 7 can be repeated until weight is constant ; (8) 
Subtract weight of dish ; difference is weight of total 
residue in amount of sample taken ; (9) Calculate as 
parts per 100,000, and as grains per gallon. 

Fixed Solids. (i) Incinerate the dried solids at as low 
a heat as possible ; (2) Watch the process for blackening 
or charring, fumes or odour. A piece of dry starch and KI 
paper held over crucible will detect any nitric oxide given 
off ; (3) Cool and weigh ; (4) Difference from weight of 
dish gives fixed solids in amount of sample taken. Calcu- 
late as before. 

Volatile Solids. Total solids less fixed solids, gives 
volatile. Consist of organic matter, nitrates, nitrites, 
ammoniacal salts, combined water, combined carbonic 
acid, and sometimes chlorides. Should not exceed 1-5 
per 100,000 in a very good water. 

EXAMPLE. Evaporated 200 c.c. sample water to dryness, 
dried in air-oven, cooled in dessicator, and weighed : 

Weight . . . . . . 19-674 grammes. 

Weight of platinum dish.. 19-554 ,, 
Difference . . . . . . 0-120 gramme. 

i.e., 0-120 grm. in 200 c.c. water, or 0-060 grm. in 100 c.c. 
or 100 grm., or 60 grm. in 100,000 grm., or 60 parts per 
100,000 parts. 

Incinerated total residue at low heat. No blackening, 
fumes, odour, nor change in starch and KI paper. Cooled 
and weighed : 

Weight . . . . . . 19-650 grammes. 

Weight of platinum dish .. 19-554 ,, 
Difference . . . . . . 0-096 gramme. 



24 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

i.e. 0-096 grm. of fixed residue in 200 c.c. of sample water, 
or 0-048 grm. in 100 c.c. or in 100 grm., or 48 parts of 
fixed solids per 100,000 parts of sample. Then volatile 
solids = 60 48 = 12 parts per 100,000 parts. 

Chlorine (present as Chlorides). This is estimated 
by precipitation with silver nitrate the end of the process 
being known by the use of a few drops of potassium 
chromate, which gives a red precipitate with silver nitrate. 
So long as there is any chlorine in solution, however, the 
red precipitate which forms when each drop of silver 
nitrate solution is added, is immediately dispelled. The 
first indication of the red colour persisting is taken as the 
end of the reaction. 

The water sample must be neutral, and certainly not 
acid. It should also be colourless, or nearly so. 

Solutions required : (i) 5 per cent solution of potassium 
monochromate, K 2 CrO 4 , free from chlorine ; (2) Silver 
nitrate solution, either decinormal or standard, say i c.c. = 
i mgr. Cl. 

Process. (i) Take 100 c.c. sample in a clean porcelain 
basin ; (2) Add a few drops of chromate solution, which 
gives the liquid a yellow tinge ; (3) Fill burette with 
silver nitrate solution, and level ; (4) Run in the solution 
drop by drop, stirring the while ; (5) Stop when the least 
permanent red tint is got ; (6) Calculate amount present 
in parts per 100,000, and grains per gallon. 

After a preliminary trial, the end reaction can be more 
accurately watched, and a second estimation should always 
be done. 

EXAMPLE. 100 c.c. sample took 6-5 c.c. standard silver 
nitrate solution, of which i c.c. = i mgr. Cl. Therefore, 
there are 

6-5x1 = 6-5 mgr. Cl in 100 c.c. sample 
in 100 grm. ,, 
in 100,000 mgr. of sample 

that is, 6-5 parts per 100,000 parts. 

For grains per gallon multiply result by 0-7, thus : 
6-5 X 0-7 = 4-55 grains per gallon. 

The result is sometimes required in terms of NaCl. 



WATER ANALYSIS 25 

Every molecule of NaCl = 58-5 parts, of which 35-5 parts 
are Cl. Therefore one part of Cl = 58-5 -f- 35-5 = 1-65 
part NaCl. Then 6-5 parts Cl per 100,000 parts of sample 
becomes 6-5 x 1-65 = 10-7 parts NaCl per 100,000 parts 
of sample. 

With decinormal silver nitrate solution the process is 
similar, but as i c.c. = 3-55 mgr. of Cl, much less solu- 
tion will be required. On this account a larger quantity 
of sample is frequently taken, say 250 c.c. When more 
than 10 c.c. of standard silver solution are required in the 
titration, it is advisable to repeat the process after diluting 
the sample water with distilled water. In this way a 
more accurate result is obtained. 

The purest water as a rule contains less than 1-5 parts 
Cl per 100,000. Increase may be due to sea-water, salt- 
bearing strata, sewage, etc., and gives cause for suspicion 
until explained satisfactorily. 

Poisonous Metals. Under this heading are usually 
included Pb, Cu, Fe, and Zn. 

The presence of lead, copper, or iron in appreciable 
amount can be determined by taking 100 c.c. in a Nessler 
glass, and adding one or two drops of ammonium sulphide 
solution, when some darkening of the sample will occur in 
proportion to the quantity present. If no change is noted, 
compared with a control, then the sample will require to 
be concentrated, and tests applied. 

A delicate qualitative test is to take two 100 c.c. Nessler 
glasses, and fill one to the 100 c.c. mark with sample and 
the other with distilled water. To each then add a few 
drops of solution of permanganate of potash to give them 
a distinct pink tinge. Then add to each I c.c. of sulphuric 
acid and i c.c. of potassium ferrocyanide, and compare the 
tints. 

Iron gives a blue tint ; copper gives a brown ; zinc 
gives a white ; and lead gives no change. The control 
shows no change. 

QUALITATIVE TEST TABLE. Concentrate sample to one- 
fifth of its bulk, say 200 c.c. to 40 c.c., and test thus : 

To 5 c.c. in a test tube add a few drops of Am 2 S solution. 
Black precipitate may be lead, copper, or iron. 
White zinc. 



26 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

1. If precipitate is black, divide into two portions. 

a. To one portion add dilute HC1 ; if precipitate dis- 
solves, then iron is present. Confirm for iron. Take two 
tubes with 5 c.c. of concentrated sample in each, after 
heating for a few minutes with a pinch of potassium 
chlorate to oxidize the iron to the ferric state. To one, 
add solution of KCNS ; blood-red colour produced. To 
other, add solution of K 4 FeCy 6 ; prussian blue colour. 

b. To other portion add KCN ; if precipitate dissolves, 
copper present. Confirm for copper. As above, take 
two tubes with concentrated solution, but without treating 
in any way. To one, add AmOH ; blue colour. To other, 
add K 4 FeCy 6 ; bronze precipitate. 

c. If precipitate does not dissolve ; then lead. Confirm 
for lead. As above, take two tubes with concentrated 
solution. To one add KI solution ; yellow precipitate, 
soluble on boiling. To other add K 2 CrO 4 solution ; 
yellow precipitate, soluble in KOH. 

2. If precipitate is white, confirm for zinc. Take two 
tubes as before. To one, add AmCl, AmOH and Am 2 S ; 
white precipitate. To other, add K 4 FeCy 6 ; white 
gelatinous precipitate. 

Arsenic. Take a litre of the water sample, add pure 
sodium carbonate until alkaline, and evaporate nearly to 
dryness. Test concentrated liquid by Reinsch's or Marsh's 
test. The former is described under Beer (page 129). 

Tin. Evaporate a litre of water sample to dryness, ash 
the residue ; exhaust ash repeatedly with strong HC1, evapor- 
ate portions to dryness on water-bath, add some water, 
boil, and filter. Test filtrate with H 2 S ; a dingy, yellow 
precipitate, soluble in Am 2 S, indicates the presence of tin. 
The precipitate is also soluble in the caustic alkalies. 

QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION. This depends on a colori- 
metric method. 100 c.c. of the sample water are taken in a 
Nessler glass, and a measured quantity of a suitable precipi- 
tating agent is added. According to the amount of metal 
present, a certain depth of coloration is obtained. 100 c.c. 
of distilled water are now taken in a Nessler glass, and the 
same quantity of precipitant added to them. From a burette, 
successive small quantities of a standard solution of the 
metal being tested for are added to the glass containing 



WATER ANALYSIS 27 

the distilled water ; and after each addition the coloration 
produced is compared with that in the glass containing the 
sample water. This is done by putting both glasses 
together on a white tile, or on a Nessler stand, and looking 
down through the liquids. If the tints are alike in depth, 
then the glasses have been matched. If the sample is the 
darker, more standard will require to be added to the other 
glass, and a further comparison made. If the sample is 
the lighter, a fresh amount of distilled water will require 
to be put up, and less standard solution added at first. In 
any case the comparisons are continued until matching of 
the tints is obtained, and then the amount of standard 
solution which has been added to the distilled water is 
held to measure the amount of metal present in the 100 c.c. 
of sample water. 

The process of comparing the tints or colorations to a 
match is called " Nesslerizing," and will frequently be used 
in subsequent work. 

Determination of Lead. A standard solution of lead 
acetate is required, of such a strength that i ex. = o-i 
mgr. ( T V mgr.) of lead. Pb (C 2 H 3 O 2 ) 2 + sH 2 O ; the 
molecular weight = 379, and contains 207 parts of lead. 
Therefore 379/207 = 1-83 parts of lead acetate contain 
i part of lead. That is, 1-83 grm. of lead acetate contain 
i gram, of lead. If we dissolve 1-83 grm. of lead acetate 
in i litre of distilled water, I c.c. will contain i mgr. of 
lead. This solution diluted ten times gives a standard 
solution of lead acetate such that i c.c. = o-i mgr. Pb. 
A solution of Am 2 S in water is also required. 

PROCESS. Take two 100 c.c. Nessler glasses, with 
distinctive marks affixed. To one add 100 c.c. of sample 
water. To the other add 100 c.c. distilled water. To 
both add 2 c.c. of Am 2 S solution, and stir. Now take a 
burette, and fill it with the standard solution of lead 
acetate. Add i c.c. of this to the distilled water and stir. 
Compare coloration produced with that in glass containing 
sample. If the sample is darker, add another c.c. of 
standard solution to the other glass, stir, and compare. 
Repeat procedure until a match is obtained. If the sample 
is lighter than the coloration produced by i c.c. of standard 
solution, begin again and add i c.c. of standard solution. 



28 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

EXAMPLE. Suppose 3 c.c. of standard solution were 
required to match sample, i c.c. of standard solution lead 
acetate = o-i mgr. Pb. Therefore 3 c.c. of standard solu- 
tion lead acetate = 0-3 mgr. Pb. Hence there is 0-3 mgr. 
Pb in 100 c.c. of sample water, or 0-3 mgr. Pb in 100 grm. 
of sample water, or 0-3 mgr. Pb in 100,000 mgr. of sample 
water ; that is, 0-3 part of Pb in 100,000 parts of sample 
water. By this method 0*05 part per 100,000, or ^ gr. 
per gallon, may be easily detected. 

Many waters, especially soft and peaty waters, possess 
a coloration sufficient to equal that produced by 0-5 c.c., 
or even i c.c. of standard lead solution. In such a case, 
carefully match the natural coloration in terms of the 
standard solution, and deduct the amount obtained from 
the amount required in the regular test. Where the 
coloration is deeper still, and a poisonous metal is sus- 
pected, evaporate 100 c.c. to dryness, ignite to get rid of 
vegetable colouring matter, digest the ash with HC1, filter, 
collect filtrate, washing filter-paper with distilled water, 
and make up bulk of filtrate to 100 c.c. Now test as before. 

As lead is a cumulative poison, its presence in a water 
should disqualify that water for domestic use. 

Copper. Copper is similarly estimated, using a standard 
solution of copper sulphate, CuSO 4 + 5H 2 O. The mole- 
cular weight of this salt in crystals is 249, and as this 
amount contains 63 parts of copper, 249/63 or 3-95 parts 
will yield i part of copper. Hence 3-95 grm. of copper 
sulphate crystals dissolved in i litre of distilled water 
gives a solution such that i c.c. contains i mgr. of copper. 
This diluted ten times gives the desired standard solution, 
i c.c. = o-i mgr. Cu. 

Copper can also be estimated by precipitation with HC1 
and potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a bronze color- 
ation. 

Iron. Iron is best estimated by oxidizing it, if necessary, 
to the ferric state, and then adding potassium sulpho- 
cyanate, which produces a blood-red colour. Reagents 
required : (i) Standard solution of ferrous sulphate, 
FeSO 4 + 7H 2 O, 0-496 grm. dissolved in i litre of distilled 
water (acidified with H 2 SO 4 ), r c.c. of this solution = 
o-i mgr. Fe. Dilute ten times in use, then i c.c. = 



WATER ANALYSIS 29 

o-oi mgr. Fe ; (2) Dilute HNO 3 solution: make up 
30 c.c. of pure concentrated acid to 100 c.c. with distilled 
water ; (3) Potassium sulphocyanate solution : 15 grm. 
KCNS dissolved in 100 c.c. of distilled water. 

PROCESS. To each of two Nessler glasses add 5 c.c. of 
each solution (2) and (3). Add I c.c. of standard solution 
to one, and to the other add a measured quantity of 
sample, say 10 c.c., and note depth of tint produced, 
compared to standard. If the two are near each other, 
proceed as before to match. If the sample is much too 
dark, use less ; if much too light, use more. Always make 
up bulk in each Nessler to be approximately equal to each 
other by adding distilled water, before finally matching. 
If more than 3 c.c. of standard solution are required, the 
tint gets too deep. 

Iron is perceptible to taste when present to the extent 
of 1 gr. per gallon, or I part in 350,000 parts of water. 

Zinc is usually determined gravimetrically. It may be 
done volumetrically with standard solution of potassium 
ferrocyanide, using copper sulphate as an indicator, the 
brown copper precipitate not being formed until all the Zn 
is precipitated. The standard solution is made 0-324 grm. 
of K 4 Fe(CN) 6 . 3H 2 O per litre. Then i c.c. = o-i mgr. Zn. 

Lime and Magnesia. These are often present together 
from strata. 

Lime. Ammonium oxalate gives a turbidity with 9 
parts per 100,000, and a white precipitate with anything 
over 20 parts per 100,000. 

Magnesia. Precipitate any lime present with ammonium 
oxalate, filter, then add AmCl, AmOH, and sodium phos- 
phate. Crystals of so-called triple phosphate will separate 
out in twenty-four hours. (MgNH 4 PO 4 .) 

For this and the next test it is better to concentrate 
to sV 

Phosphates. Add some dilute nitric acid, stir, add 
excess of ammonium molybdate, and heat. If phosphates 
are present, a yellow colour will form. 

Sulphates. Add dilute HC1 and barium chloride 
solution a white precipitate of sulphate of barium, 
insoluble in all acids. 



30 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

QUANTITATIVE ESTIMATION OF LIME, MAGNESIA, 
PHOSPHATES, AND SULPHATES. 

These are all estimated for gravimetrically by precipita- 
ting as above, collecting the precipitate, which settles 
after twelve hours, on a filter-paper of known ash ; drying, 
and igniting ; and weighing ash. The ash of lime is weighed 
as calcium carbonate, of magnesia as magnesium pyro- 
phosphate (Mg 2 P 2 O 7 ), of sulphates as barium sulphate. 
The phosphates are precipitated as triple phosphates of 
magnesium and weighed similarly. In the case of magne- 
sium, the lime salts must be removed before precipitating, 
hence the filtrate from the lime estimation is suitable for 
the purpose. 

GASES IN WATER. 

Carbon Dioxide in Water. Exists as free CO 2 ; bicar- 
bonate and carbonate ; and free CO 2 and bicarbonate. 

i. Free CO 2 . Determined by titration with N/20 
sodium carbonate solution, using phenolphthalein as indi- 
cator. On adding the N/20 solution from a burette to 
the sample, a red colour appears which gradually fades as 
the carbonate absorbs the free carbon dioxide and changes 
to bicarbonate, which is neutral to phenolphthalein. 

Na 2 CO 3 + CO 2 -f H 2 O = 2NaHC0 3 
1 06 44 

N/i sod. carb. = 53 grm. per litre and absorbs 22 
grm. carbon dioxide per litre ; hence N/20 sod. carb. 
= 2-65 grm. per litre and absorbs i-i grm. carbon 
dioxide per litre ; hence I c.c. N/20 will absorb o-oon 
grm. free CO 2 . 

PROCESS. Take 100 c.c. of sample in an Erlenmeyer 
flask on a white slab, and add one drop of i per cent 
alcoholic solution of phenolphthalein. 

Fill burette with N /20 solution of sodium carbonate and 
add to sample, c.c. by c.c., until a permanent red tint 
remains after waiting a minute or two. 

Calculate out result. 

Free carbon dioxide is almost constantly present in 
ground waters, and in inverse ratio to the amount of 
dissolved oxygen. It may be as high as 13 parts per 



WATER ANALYSIS 31 

100,000, probably derived from ground air, increasing with 
the depth and decreasing with the porosity of the soil. 

2. Carbonate and Bicarbonate. The carbonate is first 
determined by titration oi the sample with the standard 
solution of oxalic acid, in presence of phenolphthalein, 
which gives a pink colour with carbonates and alkalies, and 
is colourless with bicarbonates and acids. 
H 2 C 2 O 4 2H 2 0+2Na 2 CO 3 = 2NaHCO 3 +Na 2 C 2 O 4 +2H 2 O 

90 + 36 2 x 106 

From the equation we see that 126 grm. of crystallized 
oxalic acid react with 212 grm. of sodium carbonate, 
containing 88 grm. of CO 2 , and change it to sodium 
bicarbonate. Thus 126 grm. of oxalic acid crystals 
measure the change of 88 grm. of CO 2 from the state of 
carbonate to that of bicarbonate, or 126/88 = 1*43 grm. 
measure the change in i grm. of CO 2 . Hence a standard 
solution of oxalic acid crystals, 1*43 grm. per litre, is of 
such a strength that I litre = I grm. CO 2 , or I c.c. = I mgr. 
CO 2 . When all the carbonate is changed to bicarbonate, the 
solution becomes colourless, and the number of c.c: used 
measures the carbonate present. Boil the fluid in the flask 
briskly for ten minutes, when all the bicarbonate, whether 
originally present or derived from carbonate, is decom- 
posed with formation of carbonate (signalized by the return 
of the pink colour) and evolution of CO 2 , as shown thus : 

2NaHCO 3 = Na 2 CO 3 + H 2 O + CO 2 
Cool and repeat the titration with the standard oxalic 
solution ; the number of c.c. required measures the 
amount of carbonate now in the sample. But this figure 
represents only half the CO 2 present before boiling, halt 
of the CO 2 having gone into the atmosphere. Hence the 
figure has to be doubled, and then measures the total 
amount of CO 2 present originally in the sample. The 
amount present as carbonate is known from the, first 
titration, and so the amount present as bicarbonate is 
measured by the difference between the number of c.c. 
used in the first titration, and double the number used in 
the second titration. The rationale may be shown thus : 

(i) Na 2 CO 3 H r o , phth _NaHCOa, N f o

EXAMPLE : 100 c.c. of sample, plus phth., required 8 c.c. 
of std. oxalic sol. to decolorize. Boiled ; cooled ; and 
titrated again, when 1 1 c.c. were required. 

CO 2 as Carbonate, 8 parts per 100,000. 

CO., as Bicarbonate, 22 8 = 14 ,, 

3. Free Carbon Dioxide and Bicarbonate. These are 
estimated by the addition of excess of alkali in the shape 
of a known quantity of baryta solution. The baryta 
fixes the free carbon dioxide and that halt bound in the 
bicarbonates, precipitating both as barium carbonate. 
The excess of alkali which remains unused is measured by 
titration with standard oxalic acid solution. 

CO 2 + BaH 2 O 2 = BaCO 3 + H 2 O 
CaCO 3 -CO 2 + BaH 2 O 2 = BaCO 3 + CaCO s + 2H 2 O 
HCO + BaHO = 



224 22 

From these equations we see that one molecule of oxalic 
acid and one molecule of CO 2 are each able to neutralize 
one molecule of baryta in solution. Therefore, 126 grm. 
of crystallized oxalic acid neutralizes 171 grm. of baryta, 
which fixes 44 grm. of CO 2 ; or 126/44 = 2 '86 grm. of 
oxalic neutralizes 171/44 grm. of baryta, which fixes 
44/44 = i grm. CO 2 . Hence a standard solution of oxalic 
acid 2*86 grm. per litre is such that i c.c. measures the 
quantity of baryta which fixes i mgr. of CO 2 . 

PROCESS. To 100 c.c. of sample in a flask or bottle, 
add a drop of phenolphthalein, and then 5 c.c. of BaCl 2 
solution, 5 c.c. of AmCl solution, and 40 c.c. of baryta 
solution (o - 5 per cent). If excess of baryta is present, 
the liquid should become red, and remain so. Stopper 
the vessel and set aside for twelve hours. Thereafter 
titrate the whole sample (or an aliquot part) with 
standard oxalic acid solution. Titrate 40 c.c. of fresh 
baryta solution. The difference between the number 
of c.c. required for the fresh baryta solution and that 
required for the baryta mixe'd with sample, measured 
in c.c. of standard oxalic solution the amount -of baryta 
used up in fixing free CO 2 and changing bicarbonate 



WATER ANALYSIS 33 

to carbonate. But as each c.c. of oxalic equals i mgr. 
of CO 2 , then the number of them gives the total number 
of mgr. of CO 2 in the water sample. The free CO 2 is 
determined as before by N/2O sodium carbonate solution, 
and the difference gives the amount present as bicarbonate. 

Dissolved Oxygen. Winkler, Dibdin, Thresh, and Mohr 
have all devised methods for determining the amount of 
oxygen dissolved in water samples. Any such method must 
be simple, speedy, and accurate, and the water must not 
be operated on in an inert atmosphere, or there might be 
a rapid loss by diffusion. Winkler's is perhaps the most 
simple and readily applied, and needs no special apparatus. 
The following solutions are required : (a) Manganous 
chloride solution free from iron (80 grm. MnCl 2 + 4H 2 O 
in 100 c.c. of distilled water ; (b) KI and NaOH solution 
(10 grm. KI in 100 c.c. of 33 per cent NaOH). This 
solution when diluted, and sulphuric and starch solution 
added, should not give any blue colour ; (c) N/ioo iodine 
(1-27 grm. I and 2 grm. KI dissolved in I litre). This is 
used to standardize thiosulphate ; (d) N/ioo thiosulphate 
of soda solution (2-48 grm. Na 2 S 2 O 3 + 5H 2 O per litre) ; 
(e) Starch solution. 

PROCESS. Take a glass bottle provided with a well- 
fitting glass stopper and of about 300 c.c. capacity. 
Determine accurately the capacity when stoppered. Wash 
it out with some of the water to be examined, and then 
fill it to overflowing with sample water (avoid splashing). 
Introduce, by different pipettes, i c.c. of each of solutions 
(a) and (b), doing this carefully so that they are delivered 
close to the bottom of the bottle. Put in the stopper 
tightly, enclosing no air bubbles. Mix the contents by 
lightly swinging the bottle. A precipitate forms which is 
allowed to settle. This takes a variable time ; usually 
fifteen minutes is sufficient. When it has settled and the 
upper part of the fluid is clear, introduce by pipette, so as 
to fall on to the precipitate, 5 c.c. of strong HC1, replace 
stopper and swing until precipitate dissolves, when the 
fluid becomes yellow-coloured from liberated iodine. The 
contents of the bottle are now poured into a clean beaker, 
the bottle washed out with distilled water, and the wash- 
ings added. It is then titrated with the N /ioo thiosulphate 



34 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

solution, every c.c. of which used equals 0-00008 grm. O, 
or 0-055825 c.c. oxygen. Starch solution is used for the 
end reaction. The amount of oxygen found is present in 
the capacity of the bottle, less the 2 c.c. of solutions added. 
The result is returned in parts by weight per 100,000, or in 
cubic centimetres per litre. 

1. 2MnCl 2 + 4NaOH = 4NaCl + 2Mn(OH) 2 . 

2. 2Mn(OH) 2 + O + H 2 O = 2Mn(OH) 3 . 

3. 2Mn(OH) 3 + 6HC1 = 2MnCl 3 + 6H 2 O. 

4. 2MnCl 3 + 2KI = 2MnCl 2 + 2KC1 + I 2 . 

The process must be done rapidly. Nitrites liberate 
iodine and so vitiate the result, increasing it. Much 
organic matter interferes with the method, as it absorbs 
the liberated iodine, thus diminishing the result. Rapid 
working diminishes the latter interference. 

The amount of dissolved oxygen in a water is influenced 
mainly by temperature, being less in summer and more in 
winter. Ordinary tap water in this country contains on 
an average 7 c.c. per litre, which is about i part by weight 
in 100,000. Water is saturated at 5 C, 10 C, 15 C, and 
20 C. respectively, by 8-68 c.c., 7-77 c.c., 6-96 c.c., and 
6-28 c.c. per litre. 

Suphuretted Hydrogen. This is estimated by titration 
with N /ioo iodine, which is decolorized by the H 2 S ; thus 
H 2 S + I 2 = 2HI + S. 

PROCESS. Take 10 c.c. N/ioo iodine in a white porcelain 
basin. Fill a burette with sample, and add to basin until 
colour is gone, using starch for end reaction. The N/ioo 
iodine is made as above, and is standardized against N/ioo 
thiosulphate solution. Every c.c. of N/ioo I equals i c.c. of 
N/ioo H 2 S. But N/i H 2 S is 17 grm. per litre, therefore 
i c.c. N/i = 0-017 rm -. an d I c - c - N/ioo = 0-00017 grm. 
H 2 S, or 0-17 mgr. Hence the number of c.c. of N/iool 
used x 0-17, gives the number of mgr. of H 2 S in the amount 
of sample run in from burette to decolorize the iodine. 

HARDNESS (TOTAL, TEMPORARY, OR PERMANENT). 

Hardness is due to the presence in a water of metallic 
salts which form insoluble compounds with the fatty acids 
usually present in soap. A soap is the oleate, stearate, 



WATER ANALYSIS 35 

or palmitate of sodium or potassium. Hard soap has 
soda for its base, and soft soap has potash for its base. 
These soaps are soluble in water and form a lather there- 
with on shaking. When soap is used with a water in 
which lime, magnesia, baryta, iron, alumina, or other such 
substances are present, oleates, etc., of these bases are 
formed, which being insoluble are precipitated, and no 
lather can be produced until an excess of soap is present. 
A certain amount of the hardness is removable by boiling, 
and this is called temporary hardness, and is chiefly due 
to the carbonates of lime and magnesia held in solution 
by carbonic acid gas, and by sulphates of these, with salts 
of silica, alumina, and iron when present. The permanent 
hardness, or what still remains in solution after boiling, 
consists mainly of some sulphates, chlorides, and nitrates 
of calcium and magnesium, with a little iron and alumina. 
Free carbonic acid gas in water also consumes soap, two 
equivalents uniting with one of soap as ordinarily estimated. 
Amount of hardness is expressed as grains per gallon 
(Clark's degrees), or parts per 100,000 (metrical degrees) 
in terms of calcium carbonate. In Germany the hardness 
is expressed as metrical degrees of CaO per 100,000. 

The total hardness of a water should not exceed 30 parts 
per 100,000, if for domestic purposes. Hard waters vary 
from 20 to 30 degrees on the metrical scale ; a soft water 
from 8 to 15 ; and a very soft water from 8 downwards. 
The greater the permanent hardness, the more objectionable 
is the water ; and of a good water it should not exceed 5 
metrical, or 3 to 4 Clark. 

Determination of Hardness. 

i. BY STANDARD SOAP SOLUTION METHOD. 

Dissolve 10 grm. of castile or soft soap in i litre of a 
mixture of equal parts of distilled water and methylated 
spirit. Standardize the solution so that i c.c. completely 
precipitates i mgr. of calcium carbonate or an equivalent 
salt. The CaCO 3 may be dissolved in the least possible 
quantity of HC1, then evaporated to dryness twice, to get 
rid of the HC1, and then the resulting CaCLj dissolved in 
the proper amount of distilled water ; that is, i grm. 
of the carbonate is treated as above, and the resulting 



36 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

chloride dissolved in I litre of aq. dest., then i c.c. = 
i mgr. CaCO 3 . The soap solution is then tested with 
50 c.c. of aq. dest. (recently boiled to get rid of CO 2 ), to 
determine how much of it is required to produce a perma- 
nent lather ; that is, a lather which remains as a uniform 
film ^ in. thick on the surface of the water five minutes 
after the bottle has been laid on its side. The soap solution 
is added from a burette, -J^ c.c. at a time. The 50 c.c. are 
contained in a stoppered bottle, 150 c.c. capacity, which 
is well shaken after each addition, then laid on its side, 
and the character of the lather noted. If it quickly 
disappears, then more soap solution is added, until the 
lather has the permanence described. The amount usually 
required by 50 c.c. of aq. dest. varies from 0-2 c.c. to 
0-6 c.c., and should be determined not once for all, but 
at intervals, as it will vary with the strength of the soap 
solution, and this latter tends to deteriorate on keeping. 

The soap solution is now standardized against the 
standard CaCO 3 solution, 5 c.c. of which are added to 
45 c.c. of recently boiled aq. dest., contained in a glass- 
stoppered bottle of about 150 c.c. capacity. The soap 
solution is now added from a burette, i c.c. at a time. 
Shake briskly after each addition. When the proper 
lather is formed, the shaking of the bottle produces a soft 
sound which is different from the hard sound at first 
emitted, and heard when the bottle is held near the ear. 
Say that 4 c.c. of standard soap solution were required to 
produce the permanent lather, and that 0-5 c.c. were 
necessary for 50 c.c. of aq. dest., then 4 0-5 = 3 '5 c.c. 
have been used in precipitating the 5 mgr. of CaCO 3 
contained in the 5 c.c. of standard calcium solution. But 
we wish the standard soap solution to be 5 c.c. = 5 mgr. 
or i c.c. = i mgr. calcium carbonate. Hence it is too 
strong, and we must dilute it (with a mixture of equal 
parts of methylated spirit and aq. dest.) so as to make 
every 3-5 c.c. up to 5 c.c., or every 35 c.c. up to 50 c.c. 
The solution is now of standard strength, but requires to 
be re-standardized at intervals, as it is somewhat unstable. 

The standardizing can also be done against a standard 
solution of Ba(NO 3 ) 2 which has a molecular weight of 
261 compared to 100 for CaCO 3 . Therefore if 2'6i grm. 



WATER ANALYSIS 37 

of barium nitrate be dissolved in I litre of aq. dest. i c.c. = 
i mgr. Ba(NO 3 ) 2 equal to i c.c. = I mgr. CaCO 3 . 

Total Hardness. Take 50 c.c. of sample in bottle and 
test with standard soap solution as above until a permanent 
lather is obtained. Deduct 0-5 c.c. (say) necessary to 
produce lather, and double the answer gives the total 
hardness in metrical degrees. This multiplied by 0-7 
gives it in grains per gallon, or Clark's degrees. If more 
than 8 to 9 c.c. be required, it is advisable to dilute 
25 c.c. of the sample with 25 c.c. recently boiled aq. dest., 
and redetermine the hardness. 

Permanent or Fixed Hardness. Take 100 c.c. of sample 
water and make up to 200 c.c. with aq. dest. Boil down 
to one-half its bulk, and a little more. Allow to cool to 
60 F. (15-5 C.), and make up to 100 c.c. with aq. dest. 
Remove 50 c.c. and determine hardness as before. 

By boiling, ah 1 the free and half-bound CO 2 is driven off, 
and nearly all the CaCO., is precipitated. The CaSO 4 
and the CaCl 2 are not affected if the evaporation is not 
carried too far. Some of the MgCO 3 at first thrown down 
is redissolved as the water cools. 

Temporary or Removable Hardness. This is the difference 
between the total and the fixed hardnesses. 

NOTES. The lime salts precipitate at once with the 
soap solution ; the magnesium salts precipitate slowly ; 
hence it sometimes happens that all the Ca is precipitated 
and a lather formed which shortly disappears, and more 
soap solution is needed. The presence of magnesium salts 
is said to cause the lather to be brown in colour and to 
break very easily. More soap is required to produce a 
lather with a certain amount of magnesium, than with 
the equivalent amount of Ca, though this is ignored in 
practice. 

2. BY HEHNER'S ALKALIMETRY METHOD. 

Temporary. Titrate 50 or 100 c.c. of sample with 
N/5O H,SO 4 , using methyl-orange as indicator, until a 
permanent pink is got. The sulphuric acid decomposes the 
CaCO 3 with evolution of CO 2 , and until all the carbonate 
is decomposed, no sulphuric is free to attack the methyl- 
orange. The number of c.c. of sulphuric gives the number 



38 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

of mgr. of calcium carbonate in the amount of sample 
taken, because i c.c. N/SO H 2 SO 4 = i c.c. N/5O CaCO 3 . 
But the molecular weight of CaCO 3 is 100 and N/50 = 
i grm. per litre, hence i c.c. = i mgr. CaCO 3 . 

Permanent. To a fresh lot of sample add sufficient 
N 750 Na 2 CO 3 to precipitate as carbonate all the Ca and 
Mg present, noting carefully amount used. 

Evaporate mixture to dryness on water-bath. 

Dissolve soluble part of residue in 10 to 20 c.c. of aq. 
dest. and filter through small filter-paper. Wash out dish 
and filter-paper with a little more distilled water to ensure 
complete removal of all the Na 2 CO 3 . 

Titrate filtrate with N 750 H 2 SO 4 , using methyl-orange 
as indicator, until a permanent pink colour is obtained. 

The difference between the number of c.c. of N/5O 
Na 2 CO 3 used and the number of c.c. of N/5o H 2 SO 4 
required to neutralize, is the number of c.c. of N/5O sodium 
carbonate used up in precipitating the Ca and Mg. Every 
c.c. of same equals i c.c. of N/5O CaCO 3 = i mgr. 
CaCO 3 . Thus we arrive at the amount of permanent 
hardness in the quantity of sample taken. 

Total. The sum of the temporary and permanent 
hardnesses, as determined above, gives the total hardness. 

ORGANIC MATTER IN WATER. 

This is derived from vegetable and animal pollution, 
and is estimated in a variety of ways. 

Frankland's Method. The water is evaporated to a 
residue, which is ignited in a hard combustion tube with 
cupric oxide ; the evolved gases are collected and measured, 
and the amount of carbon and nitrogen found in these 
returned as Organic C and Organic N. In a good water 
suitable for domestic use, the Organic C should not exceed 
0-2 part per 100,000, and the Organic N should not exceed 
0*02 part per 100,000. The ratio of Organic C to 
Organic N furnishes a valuable indication of the nature 
of the organic matter present in unoxidized waters. Thus, 
unoxidized peaty waters give a high ratio of from 8 to 12 
to 20 or even more, the average being about 12, and such 
a ratio is held to indicate organic matter of vegetable 
rather than of animal origin. In unpolluted upland surface

39 



water, the ratio varies from 6 to 12 ; in surface water from 
cultivated lands, from 4 to 10 ; in shallow wells, from 2 to 
8 ; in deep wells, and springs, from 2 to 6 ; in sea water it 
averages about 1-7 ; and in sewage it varies from i to 3, 
averaging about 2.

In waters subjected to oxidation, the ratio tends to 
be reduced when the organic matter is mainly vegetable, 
and the reverse when it is animal. Loch Katrine 
water (average of five years) gave Organic C, 0-148 part 
per 100,000, and Organic N, 0-016 part per 100,000, and 
the ratio as 9-2. This method is for trained chemists only. 

Wanklyn, Chapman, and Hall's Method recognizes that 
organic matter tends to resolve itself into simpler substances, 
and chooses to estimate the amount of ammonia present, 
free in solution or as salts, as an index of the amount of 
organic matter so resolved. Further, the water is so 
treated subsequently that any organic matter remaining 
undecomposed has its nitrogen split off as ammonia ; 
this is measured and furnishes an index of the amount of 
such organic matter. The absolute amounts of these two 
ammonias (the first called " the free and saline," the 
second "the albuminoid ammonia"), and their relative 
amounts, give valuable evidence of the state of a water 
with regard to organic pollution. 

Forschammer Process, as modified by Tidy, is commonly 
called Tidy's Process, and consists in measuring the oxygen- 
consuming or absorbing power of a water, and inferring 
therefrom the amount of organic matter present. It has 
many limitations, but under proper conditions furnishes 
another item on which to found an estimate of a water. 



40 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

Kjeldahl's Process, in which the organic nitrogen is 
converted into ammonia and estimated by distillation 
along with the free and saline ammonia. This method is 
very useful in highly polluted waters and sewage effluents, 
where the estimation of the albuminoid ammonia is tedious 
and difficult. It is much used to determine the total 
nitrogen in food-stuffs, from w r hich the total proteins is 
got by multiplying by a factor which for meat foods is 
6-25, and varies for other foods. 

Free and Saline Ammonia. 

By Wanklyn's Method. Solutions required : (i) Nessler's 
reagent. This is a saturated solution of mercuric-potassic- 
iodide in ammonia-free distilled water, the whole being 
rendered strongly alkaline with caustic soda or potash. 
It may be made thus : Dissolve 35 grm. of potassium 
iodide in 200 c.c. of ammonia-free distilled water and 
12*5 grm. of corrosive sublimate in 300 c.c. of ammonia-free 
distilled water. Add the iodide solution to the sublimate 
one, when a yellow to scarlet precipitate is obtained, which 
re-dissolves in the excess of potassium iodide present. 
(Mercuric iodide is almost insoluble in water.) 

HgCl 2 -f 2KI = HgI 2 + 2KC1. 



HgI 2 + 2KI = HgI 1 .aKI. 

Now add carefully a cold saturated solution of corrosive 
sublimate, stirring all the time, until a slight red precipitate 
remains permanent. In this way excess of potassium 
iodide, above that required to keep the mercuric iodide 
in solution, is used up. 120 grm. of caustic soda in stick 
are now added to the mixture and allowed to dissolve 
and cool. If the red precipitate has disappeared, add 
again a little of the saturated solution of corrosive sublimate, 
until a slight permanent red precipitate appears. Make 
up bulk to i litre with ammonia-free distilled water. The 
solution is now ready for use. 

Nessler's solution gives a yellowish tinge with the 
faintest trace of ammonia, and if much ammonia is present 
a yellow-brown precipitate forms of di-mercuric-ammonium- 
iodide : 



WATER ANALYSIS 41 

(2) Standard solution of ammonium chloride, such that 
i c.c. = o-oi mgr. NH 3 . Ammonium chloride, NH 4 C1, 
has a molecular weight of 53-5. of which 17 parts are due 
to ammonia NH 3 . Since the standard solution is i c.c. 
o-oi mgr. of ammonia, i litre will contain o-oi grm. of 
ammonia. 

17 : o-oi : : 53-5 : x = 0-03147 grm. of NH 4 C1 will yield 
o-oi grm. of ammonia. Hence, dissolve 0-03147 grm. of 
ammonium chloride in i litre of ammonia-free distilled 
water, and i c.c. will contain o-oi mgr. of ammonia. 

PROCESS. Take a retort or boiling-flask of about 700 c.c. 
capacity, cleanse it well and rinse it out with ammonia- 
free distilled water. Now put into it 200 c.c. of ammonia- 
free distilled water, connect to a condenser, start the water 
flow in latter, and distil over 100 c.c. to rid the apparatus 
of any traces of ammonia. Test the distillate with Xessler's 
solution, and if ammonia is found in the last portions, 
repeat the distillation. If not, cool flask, wash out with 
ammonia-free water, and proceed. 

Introduce into flask 500 c.c. of sample water and render 
this alkaline by the addition of some recently-heated 
sodium carbonate. Connect to a condenser, start the water 
supply for the latter, and place a clean 50 c.c. Nessler glass 
at the end of the condenser to catch the distillate. Make 
sure that all parts of the apparatus are properly connected 
and adjusted. Now apply the flame of a Bunsen burner 
to the flask, which may be protected by a piece of gauze. 
Heat gently at first, but once the parts have got heated, 
increase the flame. Try to distil over at the rate of 50 c.c. 
every fifteen minutes. When the first Nessler glass is 
filled to the 50 c.c. mark, remove it and put another clean 
one in its place, and so on. Have a stock of six ready for 
the purpose. 

The first 50 c.c. of distillate is then tested by adding to 
it 2 c.c. of Nessler solution and mixing. Place the glass 
on a white slab, or on the glass shelf of a Nessler stand, 
and on looking down through the liquid, the amount of 
coloration produced, or its absence, is easily made out. 
With experience the depth of colour will suggest how 
much standard solution will be required to match it. 
The next step is to put up three trial glasses for comparison. 



42 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

Take three 50 c.c. Nessler glasses, and from a burette add 
to the first I c.c., to the second 2 c.c., and to the third 
3 c.c. of standard solution of ammonium chloride ; I c.c. 
= o-oi mgr. NH 3 . Fill all three up to the 50 c.c. mark 
with ammonia-free distilled water, and then add to each 
2 c.c. of Nessler solution, and mix. Put these glasses, 
distinctively marked, on the slab or shelf, and compare 
the first 50 c.c. of distillate with them as to depth of 
coloration. If the distillate matches any one of them, 
the result is attained. If it does not match any of them, 
it may be intermediate between any two of them, or be 
darker than the 3 c.c. or lighter than the i c.c. glass. In 
any case, fresh trial glasses should be put up for, as the 
case may be, -5 c.c., 1-5 c.c., 2-5 c.c., 4 c.c., 5 c.c., 6 c.c., 
of standard solution. If the distillate is darker than the 
coloration given by 6 c.c. of standard solution, it is better 
to dilute it with ammonia-free distilled water, and then to 
proceed to match. The same procedure is carried out 
with the second 50 c.c. of distillate and succeeding lots. 
The distillation is stopped when no coloration is given 
with 2 c.c. of Nessler, or at least less than will match 0-5 c.c. 
of standard solution. This usually happens with the 
fourth lot of 50 c.c. The sum of the amounts of ammonia 
found in each lot of distillate, is the total free and saline 
ammonia present in 500 c.c. of sample water. This is 
reduced to the amount in 100 c.c., and thereafter expressed 
as parts of ammonia per 100,000. The distilling over in 
separate lots is the mode recommended by the Society of 
Public Analysts, but Wanklyn recommends that only 
50 c.c. be distilled, and that the amount found in it be 
increased by one-third, on the ground that in his experience 
three-fourths of the ammonia comes over in the first lot 
of 50 c.c. 

EXAMPLE. 

First 50 c.c. of dist. matched 5.0 c.c. std. sol. of NH 4 C1. 
Second 50 c.c. do. do. 1-5 c.c. do. do. 

Third 50 c.c. do. do. 0-5 c.c. do. do. 

Fourth 50 c.c. do. do. nil 

7-0 c.c. do. do. 



WATER ANALYSIS 43 

That is, the 500 c.c. of sample water yielded ammonia 
sufficient to match 7 c.c. of standard solution of ammo- 
nium chloride, (i c.c. = o-oi mgr. NH 3 ), hence 7 c.c. 
standard solution equals 7 X o-oi = 0-07 mgr. NH 3 , and 
there is 

0-07 mgr. of free and saline NH 3 in 500 c.c. of sample. 
or 0-014 mgr. of do. do. do. in 100 c.c. 
or do. in 100 grm. 

or do. in 100,000 mgr. 

or 0-014 part of do. do. do. in. 100,000 parts. 

NOTE. In Nesslerizing, always add the AmCl solution 
first to the trial glasses, and the Nessler later. If the order 
is reversed, a turbidity is produced which prevents accurate 
comparisons. 

Likewise always use distilled water, ammonia-free. 
Pure natural water, ammonia-free, will not do, as it appears 
muddy when compared with distilled water. 

The residue in the flask is used to determine the 
" albuminoid ammonia," as now described. 

Albuminoid Ammonia is determined by breaking up 
the nitrogenous organic matter in the water sample by the 
action of an alkaline solution of potassium permanganate, 
the nitrogen being converted into ammonia, which is distilled 
off and estimated as described for free and saline ammonia. 
All the nitrogenous organic matter is not so decomposed, 
but the proportion of it which does so is sufficiently uniform 
to form a basis for deductions. The albuminoid ammonia 
is approximately one-tenth of the nitrogenous organic 
matter in the water. Solution required is " alkaline 
permanganate," made by dissolving 8 grm. of potassium 
permanganate and 200 grm. of caustic potash in noo c.c. 
of distilled water, and boiling down the bulk to 1000 c.c. 
(i litre). 

The amount of alkaline permanganate used should be 
about one-tenth of the bulk of sample taken. It should 
be mixed with three volumes of water, and boiled down to 
three volumes. That is, in present case, take 50 c.c. of 
alkaline permanganate, add to them 150 c.c. of water, and 
boil down to 150 c.c., which are added to the residue in 



44 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

flask. This gets rid of any free or saline or albuminoid 
ammonia in this added fluid. 

PROCESS. Take the residue from the estimation of 
free and saline ammonia, and keeping it still in the flask, 
add to it 50 c.c. of freshly-boiled permanganate solution, 
and about 100 c.c. of ammonia-free distilled water, to 
incfease the bulk. Some fragments of pumice stone, which 
have been heated to redness in a Bunsen flame and cooled, 
are also added. The apparatus is now fixed together 
and distillation resumed, the distillate being collected as 
before in 50 c.c. Nessler glasses. The determination of 
the amount of ammonia is made in precisely the same 
way as for free and saline ammonia. The number of lots 
of 50 c.c. to be collected cannot be approximately stated, 
as the splitting up of the organic matter occurs irregularly, 
and in this way more ammonia may be found in the second 
or third lot than in the first. The process should be 
continued until no reaction with Nessler is got. In some 
cases it may be necessary to stop the. process and allow 
the apparatus to cool, then add more distilled water, 
and then resume the distillation. The amount of ammonia 
found is of course derived from the original 500 c.c., and 
must be calculated accordingly. 

Free and saline ammonia represents the ammonia 
combined with carbonic, nitric, or other acids, and also 
what may be derived from urea, or other easily decom- 
posable substances, if present. The limit in pure waters 
is 0-002 mgr. per 100 c.c., and in a usable water it should 
not exceed 0-005 m g r - P er I0 c.c. 

Albuminoid ammonia in drinking waters of good 
quality should not exceed o-oi parts per 100,000. Much 
albuminoid ammonia with a small amount of free ammonia 
usually indicates vegetable contamination, particularly if 
the chlorides and nitrates are low. Peaty waters yield 
large quantities of albuminoid ammonia, which is slowly 
evolved ; whereas badly polluted waters as a rule yield 
their high proportion more rapidly. 

Oxygen Absorption or Consuming Power. Tidy's 
process is based on the fact that much of the organic 
matter in a water is capable of oxidation, and especially 
by permanganate in acid solution. Unfortunately, different 



WATER ANALYSIS 45 

substances reduce different proportions of permanganate, 
and slight variations in temperature and acidity influence 
the readiness of the permanganate to part with its oxygen 
to an appreciable extent. Nevertheless, the process yields 
results which, taken in conjunction with other analytical 
facts, aid materially in forming an opinion of a water 
sample. 

Reagents required : (a) Standard solution of potassium 
permanganate : 

2K 2 Mn 2 O 8 +6H 2 SO 4 =2K 2 SO 4 +4MnSO 4 +6H 2 O+5O 2 
2 x 316 5 x 32 ; 

that is, 632 parts of potassium permanganate liberate 160 
parts of oxygen, or i part of O will be set free by 3-95 parts 
of permanganate. Hence, if 3-95 grm. of the latter be 
dissolved in i litre of aq. dest., then i c.c. = i mgr. O. 
The solution is usually diluted ten times in use, so that 
10 c.c. = i mgr. O. (b) KI solution, 10 per cent in aq. 
dest. (c) Starch solution, i grm. per half litre, freshly 
boiled and filtered, (d) Sodium thiosulphate solution, 
i grm. to the litre of distilled water, (e) Sulphuric acid, 
25 per cent in aq. dest. 

PROCESS. Take two stoppered flasks or bottles of at 
least 300 c.c. capacity, and into one put 250 c.c. of sample 
water, and into the other put 250 c.c. of distilled water. 
To each add 10 c.c. of the 25 per cent sulphuric acid, and 
place them both on a water-bath at 80 F. or 26 C. When 
the required temperature is reached, 10 c.c. of the perman- 
ganate solution are added to each lot. A pink colour will 
result. Maintain the temperature, and observe carefully 
whether the pink colour is discharged. If so, then another 
10 c.c. of the permanganate solution is added to the sample 
and the control, and more if necessary to keep them 
markedly pink. Further addition of sulphuric acid is not 
needed. At the end of a specified time, which may be 
fifteen minutes, half an hour, one hour, two hours, three 
hours, or four hours, or any combination of these (the 
commonest being fifteen minutes and four hours), the 
oxidizing process is stopped by the addition of i c.c. of the 
KI solution, when the unused permanganate reacts thus, 
through its loosely held oxygen ; 50 2 + 2oKI -f loH 2 O = 



46 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

20KOH + iol z . The liquid turns a yellow colour from 
the iodine set free. The quantity of iodine liberated is 
strictly proportional to the amount of unused perman- 
ganate. It remains, therefore, to estimate the amount of 
iodine set free, which measures the amount of oxygen 
unused, and this deducted from the amount known to 
have been added, gives the amount absorbed. This is 
done by titrating the yellow solution with the thiosulphate 
solution until the yellow colour is nearly gone, and then 
adding i c.c. of starch solution to give a more distinct end 
reaction. The titration is finished when the blue is just 
gone : 

I 2 + 2Na 2 S 2 O 3 = 2NaI + Na 2 S 4 O 6 . 

Both the sample and the control are treated thus. In the 
control presumably no oxidation takes place, so that the 
number of c.c. of thiosulphate solution required for it, is a 
measure of the iodine liberated by all the oxygen free to 
cause oxidation. The amount of tniosulphate solution used 
for the sample measures the unused oxygen, and the differ- 
ence between these two numbers gives the proportion of 
oxygen used up. For example, say that 10 c.c. only of per- 
manganate were required to be used, and that after adding 
KI solution the control took 40 c.c. of thiosulphate solution 
to decolorize, and the sample took 30 c.c. ; then 40 c.c. 
of thiosulphate measure i mgr. of oxygen, and 40 c.c. 
30 c.c. = 10 c.c. measure 10/40 = 0-25 mgr. O, and 
this is the quantity absorbed by the 250 c.c. of sample 
taken. This multiplied by 0-4 gives o-i mgr. O absorbed 
per 100 c.c., or o-i part per 100,000. 

Waters of great organic purity will not consume more 
than 0-05 part of oxygen per 100,000 in fifteen minutes 
at 80 F., and if the amount absorbed exceeds o-i part in 
fifteen minutes, the sample may be considered of doubtful 
purity. After four hours' exposure, an absorption of more 
than 0-3 part must be regarded with suspicion. 

Ferrous salts, nitrites, and sulphuretted hydrogen, if 
present, vitiate the test. 

Kjeldahl's Process for the determination of organic 
nitrogen is performed only in very polluted waters. The 
process is described under Sewage and Sewage Effluents. 



WATER ANALYSIS 47 

NITRITES AND NITRATES IN WATER. 

Ammonia present in water, derived either from the 
decomposition of organic matter or by synthesis from urea, 
tends in its passage through the soil to become oxidized, 
first into nitrites, then into nitrates. Nitrates, however, 
may be present in water which has dissolved it out of strata 
through which it has passed. Sometimes these nitrates 
become reduced, first to nitrites, then to ammonia, and this 
has been specially observed as due to iron salts in the ferrous 
state. In the London basin, the deep-well waters from the 
" greensands " strata have been noted as yielding ammonia 
thus derived. Waters polluted with vegetable matter yield 
little nitrites and nitrates relatively, as plant life removes 
these, and vegetable matter contains little nitrogen. 

Nitrites. 

QUALITATIVE TESTS. 

1. Starch Iodine Test. Take 50 c.c. of sample water in a 
Nessler glass and 50 c.c. distilled water in another. To 
each add a few drops of KI solution and a few drops of 
freshly-made starch solution. Now add a few drops of 
dilute sulphuric acid to each tube. The presence of 
nitrites is indicated by an immediate blue colour. 

2. Naphthylamine Test. Take two Nessler glasses as above 
and acidulate with acetic acid. Add to each a few drops of 
naphthylamine solution in sulphanilic acid. With nitrites 
a beautiful pink colour develops in two to three minutes. 

QUANTITATIVE TESTS. 

Griess's Test. Solutions required : 

a. Metaphenylene-diamine solution, 5 grm. per litre, 
slightly acidulated with sulphuric acid, decolorized by 
boiling with pure animal charcoal. 

b. Sulphuric acid, one part of strong acid to two parts 
of aq. dest. 

c. Standard nitrite solution. This is made from silver 
nitrite because it is the most stable salt. AgNO 2 -f-KCl = 
AgCl + KNO 2 . 154 parts of silver nitrite, when treated 
with KC1, give rise to 85 parts of KNO 2 , or 46 parts of 
nitrous acid as represented by NO 2 , or 308 parts are 
equivalent to 76 parts of N 2 3 . Hence, if 308 776 = 4-06 



48 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

grm. silver nitrite are dissolved in boiling distilled water, 
and precipitated by slight excess of KC1, i grm. of nitrous 
acid as N 2 O 3 is left in solution in combination with 
potassium. The bulk is made up to i litre, the precipitate 
allowed to settle, and 10 c.c. are taken and diluted to i litre, 
then i c.c. = o-oi mgr. N* 2 O 3 (equal to i per 100,000). 
Standard nitrite solution is also made so that i c.c. 
= o-oi mgr. N, and also of millinormal strength, and 
then i c.c. N /iooo = 0-046 mgr. NO 2 . 

PROCESS. To 100 c.c. of sample in a Nessler glass, i c.c. 
of the dilute sulphuric acid and i c.c. of the metaphenylene- 
diamine solution are added as a preliminary test. If an 
orange colour is immediately produced, the tint will prove 
too deep for comparison. In such a case 50 c.c. should 
be tried, and if found suitable such an amount diluted to 
100 c.c. with aq. dest. is to be used in the real test, which 
is done thus : Having decided the amount of the sample 
to be used, it is taken in a 100 c.c. Nessler glass .and made 
up to 100 c.c. if required. Three other Nessler glasses are 
taken, and i c.c., 2. c.c., and 3 c.c. of standard nitrite 
solution added to each respectively, and the bulk is made 
up to 100 c.c. in each case with aq. dest. To all the glasses 
is added i c.c. of each of the reagents, namely M-P-D 
and H 2 SO 4 , and this is done as quickly as possible, so 
that the colours in the glasses may develop from as nearly 
as possible the same time. The glasses are set aside for 
fifteen to twenty minutes and are then compared in the 
manner known as " Nesslerizing." If the sample matches 
one of the standards, then the amount in it is known. 
If not, fresh trial glasses are put up, the amount of standard 
being gauged from the preceding experiment. 

The colour produced is Bismarck brown or triamido-azo- 
benzol. Griess's test is a very accurate one but requires that 
the water and the reagent should be colourless or be decolor- 
ized. The reagent may be bleached by pure animal charcoal. 

Ilosvay's Naphthylamme Test. 

a. Solution of sulphanilic acid 0*5 grm. in 150 c.c. of 
diluted acetic acid (specific gravity 1-04). 

b. Solution of naphthylamine made by dissolving o-i 
grm. in 20 c.c. of aq. dest., filtering, and adding 180 c.c. 
diluted acetic. 



WATER ANALYSIS 49 

PROCESS. Take 100 c.c. of sample in a Nessler glass, and 
in another the same quantity of aq. dest. and i c.c. standard 
nitrite solution. To each add 2 c.c. of each of the above 
solutions, a and b. Set aside for five minutes and then 
compare tints. If not equal in tint, abstract some fluid 
from the darker by pipette and make up the bulk with 
aq. dest. If the colours still do not match, more fluid is 
removed, and bulk made up as before. Suppose sample 
is darker, and that 40 c.c. are removed, and bulk made up ; 
and that again, 30 c.c. are removed, when finally tints 
match. Then we get : 100 x 60/100 x 70/100 = 42 c.c. 
of the original 100 c.c. match i c.c. of standard nitrite 
solution, say i c.c. = o-oi mgr. N : then 42 c.c. of sample 
contain o-oi mgr. N, and therefore 100 c.c. will contain 
o-oi x 100 -=- 42 = 0-023 m g r - N, or 0-023 P a rt of N 
as nitrite per 100,000 parts. 

The nitrites first act on the sulphanilic acid and form 
a new compound which reacts with the naphthylamine 
and forms the substance which gives the pink colour to 
the liquid. 

A water containing nitrites is not safe for domestic use, 
and should be rejected on that evidence alone, unless 
unexceptionable in all other respects. 

Nitrates. 

QUALITATIVE TESTS. 

i. Brucine Test. Take 5 c.c. of sample and add 5 c.c. of 
bmcine solution (i in 1000), then mix, and pour carefully 
down the side of the test tube some pure, strong sulphuric 
acid, free from nitrates, when a positive result is denoted 
by the appearance of a pink ring at the junction of the 
liquids on gentle shaking. The test is also performed by 
evaporating 10 c.c. of sample to dryness in a clean porcelain 
basin, then adding a crystal of brucine, and then allowing 
one drop of pure sulphuric to run down the side of the 
dish, over the solids ; when in the presence of nitrates 
a pink is obtained. Detects 0-7 part per 100,000. 
Unreliable in the presence of nitrites, which should be 
first destroyed by addition of urea and sulphuric acid to 
sample ; allow to stand aside for an hour, when test can 
be applied as before.

2. Diphenylamine Test (C 6 H 6 ) 2 NH. Take 5 c.c. of 
sample, add as much diphenylamine solution, mix, and 
run down pure strong sulphuric, when a blue colour forms 
at junction of liquids in presence of nitrates. 

QUANTITATIVE TESTS. 

i. Phenol-sulphonic Acid. This reagent is made by 
adding 6 grm. of pure carbolic acid to 3 c.c. of aq. dest. 
and then adding mixture to 37 c.c. of pure sulphuric acid. 

A standard solution of potassium nitrate is required, 
0-072 grm. to i litre, and then I c.c. = o-oi mgr. N as 
nitrates. This contains i part N in 100,000 parts of 
standard. 

PROCESS. To two porcelain dishes are added respectively 
10 c.c. of the sample and 10 c.c. of the standard. These 
are placed on the water-bath until their contents are just 
evaporated to dryness. To each of the residues add i c.c. 
of phenol-sulphonic acid, and mix well with a glass rod (if 
a large amount of nitrates is present the liquid will turn 
red). Set aside for fifteen minutes, and then wash out 
each dish successively into two clean 100 c.c. Nessler 
glasses with 25 per cent ammonia solution in distilled 
water. Add more ammonia until effervescence ceases, 
and make up to mark with aq. dest. The nitrates present 
convert the phenol-sulphonic acid into picric acid, with 
which the ammonia forms a picrate having a yellow colour, 
and the amount of this is proportional to the amount of 
nitrates present. The two glasses are now compared as 
to tints, and the darker one is diluted as before described 
under Ilosvay's test for nitrites. If the water is very 
pure, a larger amount of sample should be evaporated 
down, say 20 c.c., 50 c.c., or 100 c.c., and a smaller quantity 
of standard, say 5 c.c. If rich in nitrates, then less should 
be taken of the sample, say 5 c.c. or i c.c. 

Aluminium Process. If aluminium foil be added to a 
strongly alkaline water, decomposition of the water ensues 
with the evolution of hydrogen, which in the presence of 
nitrites or nitrates reduces these, converting their contained 
nitrogen into ammonia. Thus : 

4A1 + 4NaOH + 4H 2 O = 2Al 2 Na 2 O 4 + 6H 2 : and 
3KNO 3 + I2H 2 = 3KOH + 6H 2 O 



WATER ANALYSIS 51 

Required : (i) Thin aluminium foil ; (2) 10 per cent 
solution NaOH. 

PROCESS. Take 100 c.c. of the water sample and 100 c.c. 
of the NaOH solution in a 300 c.c. boiling-flask. Add a 
piece of aluminium foil about 1-5 inch square. Cover but 
do not cork. Set aside for six hours at least. Then 
connect the flask to a condenser and distil over the ammonia 
into 50 c.c. Nessler glasses, collecting three lots. The 
amount of ammonia is determined by comparison of the 
coloration developed in these glasses by adding to each 
2 c.c. Nessler's solution, and that developed in glasses 
containing 50 c.c. ammonia- free distilled water, plus i c.c., 

2 c.c., and 3 c.c. respectively of standard NH 4 C1 (i c.c. 
= o-oi mgr. NH 3 ), and similarly treated. The amount 
estimated by this method includes ammonia present in 
the sample, ammonia derived from nitrites, and ammonia 
derived from nitrates. The two former are separately 
estimated and deducted, and the remainder is the amount 
derived from nitrates, and is readily converted back into 
terms of NO 3 or of N. 

EXAMPLE. 100 c.c. gave ammonia equal to 40 c.c. of 
standard AmCl = 40 x o-oi = 0-4 mgr. NH 3 . But the 
water contained 0-006 mgr. of free and saline ammonia 
per 100 c.c., and 0-042 mgr. N as nitrites per 100 c.c. = 
0-042 x 17 -f- 14 = o - o5iNH 3 per 100 c.c. Hence, 0-4 - 
(0-006 + 0-051) = 0-343 mgr. NH 3 due to nitrates = 0-282 
mgr. N as nitrates per 100 c.c. or 100,000 mgr. 

Copper-Zinc Couple Method. This method is similar in 
principle to the above. A bright piece of thin zinc foil, 

3 in. x 2 in., is cleansed with dilute sulphuric acid. It is 
then rolled into a coil, so that it may fit into a 200 c.c. 
wide-mouthed bottle. Now immerse the coil for three 
minutes in a 3 per cent solution of copper sulphate. . The 
zinc becomes coated with a black deposit of metallic 
copper. Remove the coil carefully, wash in ammonia-free 
distilled water, wash in sample water, and then immerse 
in no c.c. of sample water contained in a wide-mouthed 
bottle. Stopper tightly, place in a cool dark place for 
twenty-four hours. The " Copper-zinc couple " acts 
electrically on the sample, changing any nitrates present 



52 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

to nitrites, and then to ammonia. It thus acts also on 
any nitrites originally present, so that the process estimates 
nitrates and nitrites. The reaction is finished when no 
free nitrites are found in the solution. This is determined 
by removing 10 c.c. and testing by Griess's test. If 
nitrites are found to be present, more time must be given. 
If they are absent, the remainder of the sample water is 
poured into a 700 c.c. boiling-flask, and the bottle washed 
out repeatedly with ammonia-free distilled water, the 
washings being added to the flask, and more water added 
to bring up the bulk to about 500 c.c. The water is then 
distilled as in the estimation of free and saline ammonia, 
and the amount of ammonia determined. This is restated 
as nitrogen by multiplying by 14/17 (N:NH 3 ). If the 
sample was found to contain any free ammonia, the amount 
of this would require to be deducted before assigning the 
amount found by this process to nitrates and nitrites. 

Indigo Method. Another method, which is a rapid and 
convenient one, but subject to great irregularity, is the 
indigo method. 20 c.c. of sample are taken in a beaker, 
and 20 c.c. of pure strong sulphuric acid are added. From 
a burette allow standard indigo solution to run into the 
hot mixture, until the colour of the indigo ceases to be 
discharged, and a faint greenish tinge becomes permanent. 
The estimation should be repeated, adding half a c.c. of 
indigo less to 20 c.c. of the sample, and then the sulphuric. 
When the colour is discharged, the indigo is run in drop 
by drop until colour is again permanent. The indigo 
solution is standardized against standard nitrate solution 
similarly treated. The strong sulphuric liberates free 
nitric acid, which in the hot liquid oxidizes the indigo to 
isatin, which is colourless. Owing to the heat evolved, 
the titration is best done with the beaker resting on an 
asbestos mat. 

The method is unreliable in the presence of organic 
matter, the results being too small. It also requires that 
all the procedures should be carried out exactly alike for 
the titration of the sample and the standardizing of the 
indigo solution. Otherwise it is a very simple, rapid, and 
delicate method. 

No water used for drinking purposes should contain 



-.SSj WATER ANALYSIS 53 

more than 0-35 part of nitrogen as nitrates per 100,000 
parts, unless there is some satisfactory explanation. This 
amount equals about one grain per gallon when expressed 
as N 2 O 5 , or 1-5 parts per 100,000 when expressed as NO 3 . 

ICE. 

Ice is frozen water, and it is not usually purer in 
content than the water from which it is derived. What- 
ever may be frozen out of the water is usually mineral 
matter, such as salt ; suspended matter is likely to be 
enclosed. Microbic content, when composed of the com- 
mon sewage organisms, is little affected by the temperature 
of freezing, for the most part only being rendered torpid. 
As far as possible, therefore, ice should only be used when 
made from pure water, and by a process in which it is not 
subject to risk of serious contamination. The analysis of 
ice proceeds on the same methods as for water, the ice 
being first melted. 

MINERAL WATERS AND AERATED WATERS. 

These are examined on the same principles. In the 
case of artificial waters, the spring or supply from which 
they are made should also be examined. In such also a 
search should be made for poisonous metals, such as lead 
and antimony, iron, copper, zinc, and even arsenic. 

In natural mineral waters the same careful examination 
should be made. In these the mineral content is often 
considerable, and a thorough analysis of the different 
metals present is very important. The temperature and 
the amount of carbonic acid gas are also noted. Nowadays 
the presence of metals of the radium group has acquired 
a new significance, and their occurrence is specially noted. 

INTERPRETATION OF THE RESULTS OF A 
WATER ANALYSIS. 

This must not be based on any one item, but on a 
careful consideration of the following points : 

1. Local inspection for any source of possible pollution. 

2. Bacteriological examination made as soon after collec- 
tion as possible. 



54 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

3. Chemical analysis made as soon after collection as 
possible. 

It is rare for a sample of water to yield results under the 
second and third headings, where careful local inspection 
has failed to suggest danger of pollution. It should, there- 
fore, be thoroughly carried out. 

Bacteriological examination absolutely condemns a water 
for domestic use when pathogenic organisms are found in 
it. Unfortunately the detection of these is not always 
an easy matter, and so their presence or absence is 
inferred from the abundance or scarcity of associated 
forms which are more readily found and identified. The 
result of this is that the bacteriological examination mostly 
furnishes evidence confirmatory to that derived from 
other sources. 

Chemical analysis is more rapidly accomplished than 
the other procedures, and was formerly regarded as a 
sufficient basis for diagnosis of a water sample, in regard 
to its wholesomeness or otherwise for domestic purposes. 
This is so no longer, because it is recognized that the consti- 
tuents sought for and actually found in a particular water 
sample, for the most part are of themselves non-deleterious, 
and by their excess or deficiency simply suggest the pre- 
sence or absence of the actual materies morbi. Chemical 
evidence, therefore, must be used in conjunction with ALL 
the other evidence before a definite opinion is formed, and 
even then the judgment may be wholly based on negative 
findings, which here, as elsewhere, may at any time not 
bear the interpretation put upon them. Nevertheless, 
the following statements, when cautiously used, are helpful 
in interpreting results. 

High chlorine and oxidized nitrogen, associated with 
marked free and albuminoid ammonia, suggest present or 
recent animal pollution. 

High chlorine and oxidized nitrogen (not from strata), 
with little free and albuminoid ammonia, suggest past or 
remote animal pollution. 

Low chlorine and oxidized nitrogen, and very low free 
and saline ammonia with high albuminoid ammonia, suggest 
pollution of vegetable origin. 

Deep wells often show a large amount of chlorides and 



WATER ANALYSIS 



55 



free ammonia, without these necessarily indicating pollution. 
This is especially notable in wells sunk into strata like the 
London greensands. 

The organic nitrogen in a water is mostly determined 
by the estimation of the albuminoid ammonia which only 
partially measures it. If the organic nitrogen by Frank- 
land's process be i part per 100,000, then the albuminoid 
ammonia of the same water would be about 0-615 P ai ~t P er 
100,000, containing 0-506 of organic nitrogen ; and the 
organic nitrogen by the Kjeldahl process would be about 
double that in the albuminoid ammonia, or 1-012 part 
per 100,000.

WATER ANALYSIS 57 

EXAMINATION OF A SAMPLE. 

Equal quantities are taken every hour and mixed, and a 
sample is then taken. This is examined for the following 
constituents and characteristics. The bottle containing the 
sample should be completely filled, and examined at once 
or kept in an ice chamber. 

Chlorine. Dilute with as much distilled water, and 
examine as in water analysis. 

Ammonias, In a crude sewage or unfiltered effluent, 
5 c.c. should be diluted to 500 c.c., but in a good effluent a 
dilution of ten times will usually be sufficient. Test a 
little with Nessler, and judge from coloration produced. 

Oxygen Absorption. Dilute ten to one hundred times, 
and be careful to watch for decolorization of the perman- 
ganate, as several lots may be needed. 

Nitrates and Nitrites are estimated as in water ; but as 
seen in the table above, nitrates may be present in large 
amount, especially in a good effluent, and the coloration 
produced will be much stronger than that in the standard. 

Suspended Solids can be estimated by filtering a known 
quantity of the sample through a weighed filter paper, and 
drying and weighing again. The filter paper is then 
ignited in a weighed platinum or other crucible, which is 
cooled and weighed. The increase in weight of the crucible, 
less the weight of filter-paper ash, gives the mineral content 
in the suspended solids. The loss or difference between 
the total and the mineral part is the amount of organic 
matter in suspended solids. 

Dissolved Solids are estimated in the filtrate. 

Incubator Test is a test for putrescibility laid down by 
the Mersey and Irwell Joint Committee for effluents dis- 
charged into the Manchester Ship Canal. The effluent is 
tested in the fresh state for oxygen absorption in three 
minutes. A bottle is then completely filled with the 
sample, stoppered, and incubated at 80 F. (27 C.) for a 
week. The contents are thereafter tested for oxygen 
absorption in three minutes. If the amount absorbed is 
the same or less, the effluent is considered harmless as 
regards its power of absorbing oxygen from any stream 
or river into which it may be poured. If the oxygen 



58 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

absorption has increased, putrefaction is inferred, and the 
effluent is considered unsuitable. Less absorption may be 
noted, due to oxidation having taken place at the expense 
of the nitrates and the dissolved oxygen. 

Dissolved Oxygen. Winkler's process, given under 
water, was stated to be unsuitable in the presence of 
much organic matter. It is, however, the method used 
by the Glasgow Corporation Chemist for the effluents 
submitted to him daily for analysis. The interference of 
the organic matter is got rid of by the addition of a few 
drops of weak permanganate solution, until a faint pink 
colour remains permanent. The process is then proceeded 
with as before. Another process described is that of Letts 
and Blake. In it a solution of ferrous sulphate is added 
to a measured quantity of the sample contained in a bulb 
having two openings, one closed with a stopper, and the 
other leading to a smaller bulb from which it is separ- 
ated by a stopcock. Some ammonia is added, which 
precipitates ferrous hydrate. This absorbs any dissolved 
oxygen in the sample, becoming ferric hydrate. Sulphuric 
acid in excess is then added, which dissolves the two 
hydrates, forming the corresponding sulphates, which being 
more stable allow the end titration to be done in an open 
vessel without risk of further oxidation. The amount of 
ferrous sulphate taken is titrated with standard potassium 
permanganate solution, or standard potassium bichromate 
solution, each of which is of such a strength that i c.c. = 

1 c.c. oxygen. This preliminary titration measures the 
amount of oxygen required to oxidize the ferrous sulphate, 
and the end titration with one of the same solutions 
measures the amount of ferrous salt still unoxidized, and 
the difference between the two titrations gives the number 
of c.c. of oxygen supplied by the quantity of sample taken, 
that is, the amount of dissolved oxygen. Nitrites have a 
very disturbing effect on the process, and to obviate this 

2 c.c. of a mixture of 3 volumes permanganate solution and 
i volume 50 per cent sulphuric are added, and the sample 
is allowed to stand ten minutes before proceeding. The 
preliminary titration of the ferrous sulphate, mixed with 
the same amount of sample and sulphuric, is similarly 
treated. 



WATER ANALYSIS 59 

Solutions required : (a) Ferrous sulphate solution (5 per 
cent in i per cent H 2 SO 4 ) ; (b) Standard potassium per- 
manganate solution (5-638 grm. per litre), I c.c. = I c.c. 
oxygen at normal temperature and pressure ; (c) Ltd. 
pot. bichromate solution (879 grm. per litre), i c.c.= I c.c. 
oxygen at normal temperature and pressure ; (d) Sulphuric 
acid, 50 per cent in distilled water. 

PROCESS. Measure the exact capacity of the large bulb. 
Fill it by siphonage to avoid absorption of atmospheric 
oxygen. Insert stopper and drain off excess of fluid. 
Remove stopper, withdraw 7 c.c. of fluid, add 5 c.c. of 
ferrous sulphate solution by pipette to bottom of bulb, 
fill up mouth with strong ammonia solution, and insert 
stopper. Mix by swinging. A precipitate of greenish 
ferrous hydrate forms, which absorbs dissolved oxygen, 
becoming brownish ferric hydrate. Allow to stand fifteen 
minutes. Then add 50 c.c. of the sulphuric acid solu- 
tion to the small bulb, and opening the stopcock 
allow it to mix into the larger bulb. The hydrates are 
dissolved, and sulphates formed. Pour out into a beaker, 
and titrate with permanganate in case of water, and with 
bichromate for sewage. For latter, end reaction is got 
by removing a drop of liquid from the beaker, and touch- 
ing a drop of solution of potassium ferricyanide, when if 
oxidation is incomplete, a blue colour (Turnbull's blue) is 
produced within two minutes. A control or preliminary 
titration is made by taking the same quantity of sample 
(less 7 c.c.), adding first 50 c.c. of the sulphuric acid, then 
5 c.c. of the ferrous sulphate solution, and then titrating. 
The end of the titration with permanganate is a permanent 
faint pink tint. 

The Sewage Commission recommend that the suspended 
solids should be removed before estimating the dissolved 
oxygen, because " small variations in the amounts of solids 
in suspension in effluents may seriously affect the rate at 
which effluents take up oxygen." 

Kjeldahl's Method for Total Nitrogen. Owing to the 
large amount of organic matter in sewage, the estimation 
of albuminoid ammonia is alleged to be unreliable, and 
the estimation of the total nitrogen is preferred. 



60 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

PROCESS. Take a Kjeldahl flask (a 200 c.c. flask with 
a round bottom, and made of fire-resisting glass), pipette 
into it 10 c.c. of sewage or 25 c.c. of the effluent. Add 
i c.c. of strong sulphuric acid, mix well, and evaporate 
slowly over a small flame guarded with wire gauze. When 
the fluid is reduced to very small bulk, add 5 grm. 
potassium sulphate, and 20 c.c. strong sulphuric acid. 
Heat over a small Bunsen flame, very slowly at first, until 
all frothing ceases. Continue heating for about two 
hours, or until the liquid is colourless and clear. Then 
cool the flask and contents, and carefully transfer the 
liquid to a 700 c.c. boiling-flask, washing the small flask out 
repeatedly with ammonia-free distilled water, and adding 
the washings to the large flask, making up the bulk to 
about 200 c.c. Now add sufficient strong KOH solution 
to neutralize the excess of acid, and some extra to make 
alkaline. Add a few pieces of granulated zinc to prevent 
bumping, connect with a Kjeldahl's safety bulb and con- 
denser, and distil over the ammonia into N/i sulphuric 
acid, the end of the tube from the special condenser dipping 
under the surface of 20 c.c. of the N /i acid in an Erlenmeyer 
flask. About 100 c.c. are distilled over, slowly. There- 
after the acid is titrated with N/i NaOH, using methyl- 
orange as indicator. The number of c.c. of soda required 
deducted from the number of c.c. of normal acid used (20) 
gives the number of c.c. of normal acid neutralized by 
the ammonia distilled over. Each c.c. of normal acid is 
chemically equivalent to 0-014 grm. of N. The organic 
N is got by deducting from the result obtained the amount 
previously found to be present as free and saline ammonia. 
(When this process is applied to food stuffs, this correction 
is not necessary.) 

The rationale of the process is that the organic matter 
is broken up by the acid and sulphate, and the nitrogen 
converted into ammonia, which is fixed by the excess of 
acid as ammonium sulphate. On adding excess of KOH, 
the ammonia is liberated, and is then distilled over. It is 
received into N /i sulphuric acid, forming again ammonium 
sulphate. The amount of acid left unneutralized is then 
estimated, and by difference the amount combined with 
the ammonia.

CHAPTER III. 
EXAMINATION OF AIR. 

THE chief points to determine are odour, temperature, 
pressure, humidity, carbonic acid, ozone, oxidizable and 
organic matter, noxious emanations, micro-organisms, 
suspended matter, carbon monoxide, oxygen. 

EXAMINATION OF A SAMPLE. 

Collection. Large wide-mouthed jars with rubber caps, 
and holding about 4000 c.c. (4 litres), are most convenient. 
These are thoroughly cleansed with distilled water before 
use, run dry by inverting, and capped. Their actual 
capacity should be ascertained, and marked on them. To 
collect a sample of air, one of two methods may be 
employed, namely : 

1. Place jar where sample is to be taken, and blow in 
the surrounding air by a pair of bellows having a long 
nozzle reaching down to the bottom of the jar. The 
contained air is thus displaced from the jar. 

2. Fill the jar with distilled water, and empty it at the 
place named for sampling by inverting it, and allowing it 
to drain dry. It is then capped and labelled, and the label 
inscribed with the observed temperature and pressure and, 
if not already noted, the capacity of the jar. 

Great care must be exercised not to contaminate any 
sample with the air breathed out by the observer. 

Odour. The sense of smell exceeds in acuteness any 
other means used at present to demonstrate the presence 
of minute particulate matter. It also has a special value 
in detecting the peculiar foetid odour so noticeable on first 
entering an occupied room from the open air. De 
Chaumont was the first to emphasize this, and he further 
pointed out the importance of observing it immediately 
on entering, as the sense of smell is soon blunted. He 
further pointed out the marked influence of atmospheric 
humidity in rendering the smell of organic matter more 
perceptible, an increase of i in the humidity being as 



EXAMINATION OF AIR 63 

powerful in this respect as a rise of 2-32 C. or 4-18 F. (see 
" Gordon Report on Ventilation of Houses of Parliament," 

1905). 

Temperature. By the thermometer. 

Pressure. By the barometer fitted with a vernier 
(e.g. Fortin's standard barometer). 

Humidity. By the hygrometer (direct or indirect). 
Daniell's, Regnault's, Dines', Mason's (wet and dry bulb). 
Absolute humidity, relative humidity, dewpoint, Glaisher's 
factors, Apjohn's formula. 

Carbonic Acid Gas. The determination of CO 2 affords 
an important index as to the extent to which other impuri- 
ties exist. It is usually estimated by Pettenkofer's 
method. Solutions required : (a) Baryta water 0-5 per 
cent ; (b) Standard oxalic acid solution i c.c. = 0-5 c.c. 
CO 2 at normal temperature and pressure (2-822 grm. per 
litre). 

PROCESS. This consists in exposing a measured quantity 
of baryta water to a known volume of air enclosed in a jar. 
The baryta water absorbs the carbonic acid gas, becoming 
barium carbonate, which is precipitated. The amount of 
baryta water unused or unchanged is estimated by titra- 
tion of a measured portion of the baryta water removed 
from the jar, with standard solution of oxalic acid in the 
presence of phenolphthalein. Oxalic acid is used in prefer- 
ence to sulphuric acid, because the latter would attack 
particles of barium carbonate floating in the liquid, and 
thus give rise to some degree of error. 

BaH 2 O 2 + CO 2 = BaCO 3 + H 2 O 

BaH 2 O 2 + H 2 C 2 O 4 -2H 2 O = BaC 2 O 4 + 4-H 2 O. 

From these equations we see that one molecule of baryta 
water is neutralized by one molecule of CO 2 and one 
molecule of oxalic acid. Hence the two latter are chemi- 
cally equivalent, and i molecule of oxalic acid measures 
indirectly i molecule CO 2 ; that is, 126 grm. (cryst.) 
oxalic measure indirectly 44 grm. CO 2 , or 126 grm. 
(cryst.) oxalic measure 22-32 litres CO 2 , or 2-822 grm. 
oxalic measure 0-5 litre CO 2 . Hence, if we dissolve 2-822 
grm. of crystallized oxalic acid in i litre of distilled 
water, i c.c. = 0-5 c.c. CO 2 . 



64 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

METHODS. A large jar is filled with the air sample as 
directed above. Fifty c.c. of the baryta water are added, 
the jar is capped, and shaken now and then over a period 
of half an hour. Thereafter 25 c.c. are removed from the 
jar and titrated with the standard oxalic, using phenol- 
phthalein as indicator until the red colour is just discharged. 
Twenty-five c.c. of fresh baryta are similarly titrated, and 
the number of c.c. required noted. The difference between 
this latter and the number of c.c. required for the 25 c.c. 
removed from the jar, measures in oxalic the amount of 
baryta which has had its alkalinity neutralized by absorp- 
tion of CO 2 from the air in the jar. This amount doubled 
measures the quantity so neutralized in the 50 c.c. taken, 
and as the oxalic per c.c. = 0-5 c.c. CO 2 , on multiplying 
the result by 0-5 we get the number of c.c. of CO 2 absorbed 
from the volume of air in the jar. The CO 2 is at normal 
temperature and pressure, and the air in the jar is at the 
temperature and pressure noted on collection of the sample, 
and so these two volumes are not quite comparable. The 
volume of sample in the jar must first be corrected to the 
volume it would occupy at standard temperature and 
pressure. This may be done after several fashions, but 
the one here recommended is to use the formula 

V X P V X P' 



where V P and T denote respectively volume at 
standard pressure (760 mm. or 29-92 inches of mercury) 
and at standard absolute temperature (o C -f 273 or 
32 F. + 459), and V, P', and T', the volume of the jar as 
measured (less 50 c.c. displaced by the baryta water 
added), and the pressure and temperature at the time and 
place of taking the sample, the temperature being changed 
to the absolute scale. 

Thereafter the proportion of CO 2 present is calculated 
and the result expressed, which may be stated as a per- 
centage, or parts per 1000 or per 10,000. The air of the 
open country averages almost exactly 3 parts per 10,000. 

Haldane's Method requires a special apparatus, but once 
facility of manipulation of the apparatus has been acquired, 
an accurate result can be obtained in ten minutes and 



EXAMINATION OF AIR 65 

without any calculation. The method consists in subjecting 
25 c.c. of air to exposure to caustic potash, which absorbs 
the CO 2 , and the diminution in volume is measured under 
the same conditions of temperature and pressure, and the 
divisions on the graduated portion of the burette are each 
TiTTfTToth part of the whole capacity of the burette, so that 
the result is read off in parts per 10,000. 2KOH + CO 2 = 
K.COa + H.0. 

Hesse's Modification of Pettenkofer' s Method is to collect 
the sample in a flask, from 250 c.c. to 1000 c.c. capacity, 
closed with a rubber stopper with two holes plugged with 
glass rods. One of the plugs is removed, and a pipette 
containing 10 c.c. of baryta is inserted in its place. The 
other plug is loosened, and the baryta allowed to run into 
the flask. The pipette is then removed and the plugs are 
reinserted, and the flask shaken from time to time. After 
half an hour a plug is withdrawn, a drop of phenol- 
phthalein added, and the nozzle of a burette containing 
standard oxalic one-tenth the strength of that used in 
Pettenkofer's process is placed in the vacant hole, and the 
baryta in the flask titrated. The other titration to ascer- 
tain the oxalic equivalent of 10 c.c. of fresh baryta is 
done as before. The advantage of the method is that 
there is less exposure of the baryta to the air not in the 
flask. Equations 

Ba(OH) 2 + CO 2 = BaCO 3 + H 2 O 
Ba(OH) 2 + H 2 C 2 4 = BaC 2 4 -f 2 H 2 O. 

Pettenkofer's name is attached to another method in 
which air is aspirated through a known bulk of baryta 
water spread out lengthwise in a tube so that the air 
bubbles through the baryta solution. 

Lunge and Zeckendorfs Method is to take a known 
quantity of N/5oo Na 2 CO 3 in a glass bottle fitted with a 
two-holed stopper and two glass tubes as in a wash-bottle. 
An indiarubber bulb of a standard capacity with an inlet 
and an outlet tube, both fitted with valves, has its outlet 
tube attached to the glass tube leading to the bottom of 
the bottle and under the surface of the solution of sodium 
carbonate. The bulb is compressed slowly, and the air 
expressed bubbles through the fluid in the bottle, and 



66 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

the latter is then shaken. The manoeuvre is repeated 
until the fluid (which had been coloured pink by the addi- 
tion of phenolphthalein) becomes colourless from the 
Na 2 CO 3 absorbing CO 2 and forming NaHCO 3 . The 
number of compressions of the bulb required are counted, 
and by reference to a table the proportion of carbonic 
acid gas present in the air tested is obtained. The method 
is very tedious if the air is pure, as forty-eight compres- 
sions are required to detect 3 parts per 10,000. 

Scurfield's Apparatus. Mr is aspirated through weak 
baryta solution, 3 parts per 10,000, coloured red by 
addition of phenolphthalein. 

Ozone. 

1. Houzeaus paper. A piece of neutral or faintly 
reddened litmus paper soaked for a quarter of its length 
in neutral KI solution and dried (keep in dark). When 
exposed to ozone the KI is decomposed and K 2 O formed, 
which turns the litmus blue at soaked part only. Cl and 
Br would not do this. N 2 O 3 would turn rest red. NH 3 
use control. 

2. Schbnbeins paper. KI and starch paper turned blue. 
Cl, Br, N 2 O 3 , H 2 O 2 all give same result. 

3. KI and phenolphthalein papers turned red. H 2 O 2 
gives same result. Cl, Br, and N 2 O 3 give a brown. 

4. Arnold-M entzel paper. Chromic acid paper is negative. 
Hydroxyl gives a blue. 

5. Engler and Wild's manganous chloride paper. Ozone 
turns it brown. Hydroxyl has no action, but ammonia 
also gives a brown. 

Oxidizable and Organic Matter. This is best 
determined by washing the air (by shaking with distilled 
water or slowly aspirating through the same) and examin- 
ing the washings, as in water analysis, for total nitrogen- 
free, saline and albuminoid ammonias, nitrous and nitric 
acids, and oxygen absorption. 

Carnelly's process is sometimes used, but is not very 
reliable. A millinormal solution of permanganate is acidu- 
lated with sulphuric acid, and 50 c.c. are added to an air 
jar containing the sample, and exposed with occasional 
shakings to its influence for about half an hour. There- 



EXAMINATION OF AIR 67 

after 25 c.c. are removed and compared with the same 
quantity of fresh solution, and the number of c.c. of 
same required to be added to bring its colour up to that of 
control is noted. From this number the amount of oxygen 
absorbed can be calculated and the result expressed in 
parts per million. 

Noxious Emanations. Under this heading is con- 
sidered the search for foreign gases and vapours in the 
air, such as fumes of hydrochloric, nitric and nitrous, 
carbonic, and sulphurous acids, sulphuretted hydrogen, 
chlorine, ammonia, carbon monoxide, ammonium sulphide, 
carbon bisulphide, carburetted hydrogen, robuiite, nitro- 
benzol. 

Scheme for detection. Take sample in jar. 

1. Remove cap or stopper, smell, and replace stopper. 
Chlorine, HC1, SO 2 , ammonia, ammonium sulphide, 
sulphuretted hydrogen and carbon bisulphide, all have 
characteristic odours. Carbonic, nitrous, and nitric acids 
have not. 

2. Take a piece of red and a piece of blue litmus paper ; 
moisten in some neutral distilled water, attach to a piece 
of stick, and hang down into jar free of sides. After waiting 
a minute, note change of colour. 

3. If reaction acid or alkaline, pour rapidly into jar 
10 c.c. of ammonia-free distilled water, replace stopper, 
and shake vigorously. Remove half of this water, and 
test for dissolved gas. 

A. If the reaction was acid, then it is likely to be 
carbonic, hydrochloric, sulphurous, nitric, or 
nitrous acid. Add to water removed from jar a 
few drops of silver nitrate solution. 

White precipitate denotes either : 

a. Carbonic acid : precipitate very slight, 
acidity also very faint, baryta water added 
to jar becomes turbid after shaking, and 
turbidity is increased by adding ammonia. 

b. Hydrochloric acid : precipitate marked, 
acidity ditto, precipitate insoluble in nitric 
acid, soluble in ammonia, and also in KCN. 



68 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

c. Sulphurous acid : precipitate marked, 
soluble in nitric, soluble also on heating, 
but the solution darkens from formation 
of sulphide of silver. The water will also 
decolorize iodide of starch solution, and 
warmed with Zn and HC1 gives off H 2 S, 
which darkens lead acetate paper. Odour 
characteristic. 

No precipitate, infer nitric or nitrous acid. 
Test for these as described under water 
analysis. 

B. If the reaction was alkaline, gas is either ammonia 
or Am 2 S. 

To water from jar add a little Nessler's solu- 
tion. Yellow to amber colour ammonia. 

Characteristic odour. 

Black colour, Am 2 S ; nitroprusside of Na 
gives a violet ; smell of H 2 S. 

4. If litmus is unaffected, may be either : 

H 2 S, PbAc papers blackened, odour characteristic. 
CS 2 , colourless volatile liquid giving off an 

inflammable vapour with a garlicky odour. 

The liquid burns with a blue flame giving off 

sulphur dioxide fumes, and leaving a deposit 

of sulphur. 

5. If the blue litmus is first slowly reddened and then 
bleached, the gas is 

Chlorine : filter paper moistened in KI solution is 
first darkened and then bleached. Odour 
characteristic. Red colour, with mixture of 
proto-salt of iron and KCNS. 

Estimation of some Gases detected as above. Hydrochloric, 
nitrous, and nitric acids are absorbed in freshly distilled 
water, and tested for as in water analysis. Chlorine by 
pure KI solution, from which it liberates iodine, which is 
titrated with thiosulphate of sodium. Bromine similarly. 
Sulphurous acid by absorption in a decinormal solution of 
iodine. Sulphuretted hydrogen similarly. Carbon bi- 
sulphide by absorption in a strong solution of potash in 
alcohol, and after titration with standard iodine solution. 



EXAMINATION OF AIR 69 

In all these cases the air to be tested is slowly aspirated 
through the liquid named. Ammonia can be absorbed in 
pure water and Nesslerized. 

Micro-organisms. See BACTERIOLOGY. 

Suspended Matter. Aspirate large quantities of air 
through small amounts of water in a series of wash-bottles ; 
evaporate down to aliquot part, mount a drop and count 
number of particles, or to dryness and weigh residue, which 
may then be ignited and cooled and re-weighed for non- 
volatile part. Pouchet's aeroscope. Hesse's apparatus. 
Sugar filter. Aitken's method. Is composed of animal, 
vegetable, and mineral matter. Varies in towns from 
5 to 25 mgr. per c.m., or otherwise expressed from 10,000 
to 2,000,000 particles per c.c. Shaw calculates that 
400 tons of soot are thrown into the air of London per 
day. In London 40 cwt. of soot are deposited on each 
acre of ground per annum, and in Glasgow 22 cwt. in 
summer and 25 in winter, making 47 in all. 

Carbon Monoxide. From stoves, in water gas, 6 per 
cent in coal gas, in mines. Affinity for haemoglobin 300 
times that of oxygen. Kills when blood is saturated up 
to 60 to 80 per cent. Haldane advises the use of birds 
and mice as indicators in mines. 

Haldane 's Method. Take 5 c.c. dilute blood solution in 
a clean dry bottle, aspirate in some suspected air, cork 
and shake for ten minutes, protecting from light. Pour 
out into a test tube and compare with some of original 
blood. If CO present, the treated blood will be pink. 
The test is made quantitative by adding carmine solution 
to the normal blood until tints equal, and repeating with 
normal blood saturated with coal gas. 

Spectroscope : spectrum similar to OxyH, but not reduced 
by Am 2 S. May also be absorbed by copper subchloride 
in a Hempel's gas burette. 

Oxygen. This may be estimated by combustion with 
hydrogen, or by absorption in an alkaline solution of 
pyrogallic acid, or by absorption by nitric oxide. The 
two latter are done in a Hempel's gas burette, and in the 
pyrogallic method the carbonic acid is also absorbed and 
has to be separately estimated and deducted. In these 



70 



PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 



methods care must be taken that the temperature and 
pressure do not vary while the experiment is in progress. 
Gases in Mines. The atmosphere in mines is liable to 
become dangerously contaminated by noxious gases 
issuing from the coal face, such as sudden discharges of 
marsh gas from accumulations under pressure in the coal 
measures (so-called " blowers "), by accumulation of dust 
which may fire, and by the gases resulting from fires and 
explosions. The following table gives the principal gases 
found in mines, and their popular and other names.

CHAPTER IV. 
SOILS. 

SOIL is the term used to denote that portion of the 
earth's crust which by its condition or properties can 
affect health. It is conveniently spoken of as composed of 
two layers : (i) an upper or surface soil, and (2) a deeper 
or subsoil layer. The upper layer contains the products 
of the decay of animal and vegetable matter, constituting 
mould or " humus." The subsoil layer is intermediate 
between the upper layer and the underlying formations or 
strata. Both layers are originally derived from these 
deeper layers by " weathering," a geological term which 
includes all those forces that make for denudation of 
surface. 

EXAMINATION OF A SAMPLE. 

Ground Air. The amount of air in soil varies with its 
porosity, and its state in regard to moisture. Thus a dry 
porous soil may contain, if loamy, 70 per cent ; if loose 
sand, 40 to 50 per cent. Such air is collected by aspiration 
through a tube leading to a perforated bulb, sunk into the 
soil, in which an opening has been made. The analysis of 
ground air is made for : CO 2 (increases with depth, most 
in summer and autumn, least in winter and spring, more in 
impure porous soils ; varies from 4 to 8 per cent in January, 
to 8 to 24 per cent in August) ; Moisture : 85 per cent ; 
Oxygen : 21 to 18 per cent. The amount, in a quantity of 
soil, may be estimated by filling a burette to the zero mark, 
with sample of soil, and connecting the nozzle with that 
of another burette containing 50 c.c. of water, by a piece 
of rubber tubing. On opening the stopcocks and raising 
the burette containing the water, the water flows into the 
other burette, wetting the soil. The process is stopped 
when the water reaches the zero mark, by closing the 
stopcocks. The loss of water from the one burette is a 
measure of the amount absorbed by the soil displacing the 
contained air. 



72 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

Ground Water Is divided into (i) Moisture, which is 
the water present along with ground air, simply moist er ing 
the particles ; and (2) Subsoil water, which is the condition 
when the particles and their interstices are full of water. 

The amount of moisture in a soil is estimated by drying 
a weighed portion of it ; the loss of weight being calculated 
as moisture. 

The level of the subsoil water is studied by digging a pit 
or well, and observing from time to time the varying levels. 

Soil Temperature- Is taken at the depth of 4 feet by a 
specially sluggish thermometer, enclosed in a protecting 
case. The soil temperature attains its maximum in July 
and August. 

Soil is also examined chemically for total nitrogen, 
phosphates, sulphates, nitrates, and peaty acids. An 
aqueous extract of a weighed quantity of it may be 
examined for chlorides, ammonias, etc. It is also separated 
mechanically into particles of different sizes, and into clay, 
sand, etc. 



CHAPTER V. 

FOODS. 

EXAMINATION OF MILK. 

AVERAGE composition of cow's milk : Water, 87 to 88 % ; 
proteid, 3 to 3-5 % ; fat, 3-5 to 4-5 % ; sugar, 4 to 5 % ; 
mineral matters. 0-7 %. 

Physical Characters.- Placed in a narrow glass it 
should be quite opaque, of full white colour, without 
deposit, without peculiar smell or taste, and when boiled 
it should not change in appearance. The temperature 
should be taken. 

Reaction. Should be slightly acid, or neutral, or very 
feebly alkaline. Fresh milk is sometimes both acid and 
alkaline to indicators, that is, amphoteric, turning red 
litmus blue and turmeric to brown. Strongly alkaline : 
cow ill, or much colostrum, or addition of sodium carb. 
Strong acidity : lactic or butyric acids, and indicative of 
retrograde change. 

Cream. Stand 100 c.c. in a measure for twenty-four 
hours in a still atmosphere. Read off proportion of cream. 
Should be T ^ to T y^ ; generally about y^. Alderney cows 
give -j 3 ^ to -jffy. Time of year and breed to be considered. 

Specific Gravity. At 15 C. or 60 F. Varies from 
1027 to 1034, being less as fat is greater. The specific 
gravity is raised by skimming and can be reduced by 
adding water, so that this factor alone is not a reliable index 
to the character of a sample. The specific gravity falls 
i for each rise of 10 F. above 60, and at 60 F. there 
is a loss of 3 of specific gravity for every 10 per cent of 
water added. 

Three methods Specific gravity bottle, lactometer, and 
Westphal balance. 

Total Solids. Ought not to be below 11-5 per cent ; 
but are more usually 12 to 13 per cent. Take 2 c.c. of the 
milk in a flat shallow dish of known weight. Evaporate 
to dryness over the water-bath, and then in the water-oven 



74 

for half an hour, and weigh. The increase in weight is the 
amount of total solids in 2 c.c. If the specific gravity of 
the milk is known, the weight of 2 c.c. is readily calculated, 
and the percentage of total solids is then worked out. 
Some analysts weigh 5 grm. of milk into the dish, and 
thus avoid using the specific gravity. 

Ash. The dried solids are incinerated at as low a heat 
as possible, and, on cooling, the dish is reweighed and the 
percentage calculated. It averages in normal milks about 
0-73, and should not fall below 0-7. Water ng makes it 
less. Test ash for effervescence ; if marked, suggests 
addition of a carbonate. 

Fat. This is a very important determination. Several 
methods. 

Werner-Schmidt Method. Ten c.c. of the milk are 
pipetted into a Stokes' tube, and strong HC1 is added to the 
20 c.c. mark. The mixture is now heated in the water- 
bath, or carefully over a flame, until it turns a brown 
colour. Now cool the tube and its contents in water, and 
then add ether to the 50 c.c. mark. Cork the tube firmly, 
and mix the contents well by inverting slowly ten to 
twelve times. Set the tube down in an upright position to 
allow the ether to separate and become clear. Pipette off 
10 c.c. or 15 c.c. of the ether into a weighed platinum 
capsule, or other dish, evaporate the ether on water-bath 
at 60 C., dry at 100 C., cool and weigh. The increase of 
weight is weight of fat dissolved in the amount of ether 
taken by pipette. Now observe number of c.c. of ether 
still in the tube, plus f of the fluffy layer, separating the 
clear ether from the dark liquor. Calculate by proportion 
amount of fat dissolved in this quantity of ether, and add 
the result to former ; the sum gives the amount of fat 
derived from 10 c.c. of milk sample. Express result as 
weight of fat per 100 grm. of milk. To do this specific 
gravity of sample must be observed. 

EXAMPLE. Twenty c.c. of ether removed from tube 
gave a residue of 0-286 grm. Ether still in tube (plus f 
fluffy layer) 2-8 c.c. Therefore as 20 : 22-8 : : 0-286 : x - 
0-326 grm. of fat in 10 c.c. of milk sample. But specific 
gravity of sample was 1030-5, hence 10 c.c. weigh 10-305 



FOODS 75 

grm. Then by proportion 10-305 : 100 : : 0-326 : x = 
3-16 grm. of fat in 100 grm. of milk, or 3-16 per cent. 

Adams' Process. Using a Soxhlet apparatus is the 
official method of the Society of Public Analysts. 

Take a strip of Adams' fat-free paper, and from a pipette 
spot over it 5 c.c. of milk sample. Dry the paper high over 
a Bunsen flame, and finally in the water-oven. Roll paper 
up into a coil, and put it into a Soxhlet apparatus attached 
below to a clean dry flask (wide-mouthed) of known weight 
and above to an invert condenser. Sufficient ether (specific 
gravity 0-720) should be used to fill the Soxhlet tube to the 
top of the siphon one and a half times. The flask is sup- 
ported in an evaporating-basin containing water. The 
basin is heated by a small flame. The ether evaporates 
and is condensed, running back over the paper, soaking it, 
and filling the tube until, when the level reaches the top of 
the siphon, the latter acts and empties the whole amount 
back into the flask, carrying with it the dissolved fat. 
Twelve such siphonings at least should take place, and 
then (the flame being meanwhile withdrawn), the condenser 
is fixed in the usual position, and the ether distilled over. 
The flask is then detached and dried in the water-oven 
(laid on its side) to a constant weight. The weight obtained, 
less the weight of the flask, gives the weight of fat in 5 c.c. 
of milk sample, and this is calculated out as in above 
example to a percentage. 

Never heat the flask containing ether over a naked flame, 
but in a vessel of water at about 60 C., keeping the ether 
in a gentle state of ebullition. 

Gerber's Process is somewhat similar, using a Gerber 
apparatus. 

Leffmann-Beam Process. Using a special set of graduated 
bottles and a special centrifugal machine. Into one of 
the bottles 15 c.c. of sample are introduced by means of a 
pipette, and then 3 c.c. of a mixture of equal parts of amylic 
alcohol and strong HC1, and these are thoroughly mixed. 
Then 9 c.c. of pure concentrated sulphuric acid are added 
slowly, i c.c. at a time, shaking after each addition. The 
milk will gradually assume a chocolate colour passing on to 
a deep brown. Now fill up bottle to zero mark with a hot 
and freshly-made mixture of one part of sulphuric acid to 



76 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

two parts of water. The bottle is placed in the machine, 
and balanced with a similar one filled with sulphuric (i in 2), 
and the machine rotated for at least two minutes. On 
stopping, the fat will be seen to have separated out as a 
layer on the top, and the percentage is read off, each gradua- 
tion representing o-i per cent of fat by weight. The 
reading is from the extreme top of the fat column to 
extreme bottom. 

There is also a Gerber process similar in principle. 

Maceration Process. Is used at Somerset House in the 
Government Laboratory, and is specially suited to the 
analysis of sour milks. It consists in neutralizing the 
acidity with N /io strontia, evaporating to the consistency 
of soft cheese, repeatedly washing with ether, which is run 
through a filter-paper of known weight, weighing the fat- 
free solids plus the filter-paper washed free of fat, and thus 
the solids-non-fat are obtained, an allowance being made 
for the strontia added. This figure deducted from the 
total solids obtained from another portion of the sample 
gives the amount of fat. (Several corrections are made in 
calculating the solids for alcohol, for volatile acid, and for 
ammonia.) 

Calculation Method by Hehner and Richmond's Formula. 
F = 0-859 X T 0-2186 x G, where F represents the 
percentage of fat, T the percentage of total solids, and G 
the last two figures of the specific gravity (including any 
decimal). For skim milks, where G -r- T exceeds 2-5, the 
following modified formula is used : F = 0-859 X T - 
0-2186 x G 0-05 (G -T- T 2-5). A third formula gives 
T where G and F are known. T = 0-25 X G + 1-2 X 
F -|- 0-14. 

Solids-not-Fat Are obtained by subtraction of the 
fat from the percentage of total solids. Should not be less 
than 8-5 per cent. 

Calculation of Amounts of Adulteration (by Skim- 
ming and Added Water). A milk may be skimmed 
of fat, or have water added, or be treated in both ways. 
The Board of Agriculture has fixed the standard for fat in 
milk at not less than 3 per cent, for solids-not-fat not less 
than 8-5 per cent, and for total solids not less than 11-5 
per cent (3 + 8-5). Most pure milk samples give total 



FOODS 77 

solids = 12 per cent to 13 per cent. If a milk sample 
gives a lower figure for fat or solids-not-fat than these 
standards, adulteration is assumed to have been practised, 
and the burden of proof to the contrary rests with the 
vendor of the milk sampled. 

1. If the solids-not-fat figure is less than 8-5 per cent, 
and the fat figure is 3 per cent or above, the milk has been 
watered, and the amount of water added is calculated from 

the formula : (8-5 SnF) x ^- = percentage of added 

water. 

2. If the fat figure is less than 3 per cent, and the SnF 
figure is 8-5 per cent or above, then fat has been abstracted, 
usually by skimming, or already skimmed milk has been 
added. The percentage of fat present deducted from 3 
per cent, when multiplied by 100 and divided by 3, gives 
the percentage of fat abstracted. (3 F) x -ip = per- 
centage fat abstracted. 

3. If both the figures (SnF and F) are below the standard, 
the percentage of added water should first be calculated, and 
a further calculation made to see if the addition of this 
amount of water would account for the lowness of the fat 
figure. If it does not, the amount of fat removed is 
calculated thus : The percentage of fat present deducted 
from that found by calculation after allowing for the water 
added is multiplied by 100 and divided by 3. Thus a milk 
having 7-65 per cent of SnF and 2-7 per cent of F would be 
returned as having 10 per cent of added water. If the SnF 
are still 7-65 per cent, and the F is now 2-4 per cent, it 
would be said to have 10 per cent of added water and 10 
per cent of fat abstracted. 

Lactose in Milk. May be determined by the Saccharo- 
meter (certain proteins having been first removed), or by 
Fehling's test as now described. Take 10 c.c. of the milk 
sample in a test tube, add a few drops of acetic acid, and 
warm. The casein coagulates, carrying the fat with it. 
Pour into a Nessler glass, washing out all the curd, and 
make up the bulk to 100 c.c. Break up the curd and filter 
several times, until whey is as clear as possible. Fill a 
burette with the whey. Take 10 c.c. of standard Fehling's 
solution in a porcelain basin, add 50 to 80 c.c. of aq. dest., 



78 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

and bring to the boil, and just keep boiling. Now add the 
whey from the burette until all the blue colour is discharged. 
The end reaction is difficult. Allow to settle, place a drop 
of supernatant liquid on a white tile, add a drop of K 4 FeCy 6 , 
and then a drop of acetic acid. A brown precipitate shows 
that some copper is still unreduced. 

Read the amount of whey added, divide by 10. This 
gives the amount of milk which exactly reduces 10 c.c. of 
Fehling's solution. But 10 c.c. of Fehling's solution are 
reduced by 0-0667 S rm - f lactose, so that this quantity 
of milk contains 0-0667 S rm - f lactose, and the amount 
in 100 c.c. and 100 grm. is readily calculated. 

Fehling's Solution : synonyms, potassio-cupric tartrate 
solution, or alkaline cupric tartrate solution consists of 
34-65 grm. of crystallized copper sulphate, CuSO 4 '5H 2 O, 
176 grm. of Rochelle salt, KNaC 4 H 4 O 6 -4H 2 O, 77 grm. 
sodium hydrate, NaOH, dissolved in water and bulk made 
up to 1000 c.c. Of this solution 10 c.c. are completely 
reduced by 0-05 grm. of glucose, laevulose, or invert sugar. 
Fehling's solution does not keep well, and so it is often 
made up in two parts, equal measures of which produce, 
when mixed, Fehling's solution. Solution No. i : 34-64 
grm. of copper sulphate crystals dissolved in water, 0-5 c.c. 
sulphuric acid added, and bulk made up with water to 500 
c.c. Solution No. 2 : 176 grm. Rochelle salt and 77 grm. 
caustic soda dissolved in water, and bulk made up to 500 c.c. 

Cane Sugar in Milk. (Present in preserved milks, 
but here described for completeness.) Take a portion of 
the whey from the above process, and boil it with i c.c. 
of strong HC1. Cool and neutralize with anhydrous sod. 
carb., and make up bulk originally taken to three times 
with distilled water. Estimate the invert sugar produced 
as for lactose. Subtract the percentage of lactose pre- 
viously found from the percentage of invert sugar now 
obtained, and the remainder is the amount of invert sugar 
derived from cane sugar. This multiplied by 0-95 gives the 
percentage of cane sugar present. 

Nitrogen in Milk Is the most constant ingredient, 
and never falls below 0-5 per cent. Ten grams, of milk 
are weighed into a dry Kjeldahl flask. Evaporate to dry- 
ness on the water bath, and to the dried residue add 20 c.c. 



POODS 79 

strong sulphuric and 5 grm. pot. sulphate. Heat gently 
over a Bunsen flame until all frothing ceases, and then 
place on a stand over a small Bunsen flame until the liquid 
is colourless and quite clear. Cool the flask and contents, 
and add 50 c.c. of water, and neutralize with strong NaOH 
solution, adding slight excess to make alkaline. Distil 
over the ammonia into 20 c.c. of normal acid sulphuric, the 
distillation taking about an hour. Titrate with decinormal 
alkali, using methyl orange as indicator, and the difference 
in the titre found and what the titre should be represents 
the amount of nitrogen in the amount of milk taken, and 
this is converted into albuminoids by multiplying by 6-39. 

Microscopic Examination. This is always advisable. 
The strictly normal constituents are round oil globules of 
various sizes in an envelope and a little epithelium. The 
abnormal constituents are epithelium in large amount, pus, 
conglomerate masses, and casts of the lacteal tubules. The 
added matters may be starch grains, portions of seeds, and 
chalk. 

Bacteriological Examination. See BACTERIOLOGY. 

Proteids in Milk. Ritthausen's Method. Consists in 
precipitating with copper hydrate, which carries down the 
fat and proteids. The precipitate is collected, dried, and 
weighed on the filter paper. Deductions are made for the 
amounts of fat, salts, and copper hydrate precipitate, and 
the weight of filter paper, and the remainder is the weight 
of proteids in the quantity of milk taken. 

Boiled Milk. To 10 c.c. of milk sample add i c.c. of 
solution of ortol and a few drops of peroxide of hydro- 
gen solution. In unheated milk a crushed-strawberry 
colour is produced. If the milk has been heated above 
72 C. (181-6 F.) no colour will be produced, but on the 
addition of a little unheated milk the colour will appear. 
As milk is pasteurized at 159 F., such milk will be positive 
to this test. Paraphenylenediamine (replacing ortol) gives 
an indigo-violet in milk not heated above 78 C. 

Preservatives in Milk. L.G.B. Circular, 1906. " The 
presence in milk of formalin to an amount which is ascer- 
tained by examination within three days of collecting the 
sample to exceed i part in 40,000 (i part per 100,000 of 
formic aldehyde) raises a strong presumption that the 



80 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

article has been rendered injurious to health, and that the 
purchaser has been prejudiced in the above sense ; also 
that similar presumption is raised where boron preserva- 
tives are present in milk to an amount exceeding 57 parts 
per 100,000 or 40 grains per gallon." A Departmental 
Committee of the Board of Agriculture (1901) recom- 
mended " that the use of any preservative or colouring 
matter whatever in milk offered for sale in the United 
Kingdom be constituted an offence under the Sale of Food 
and Drugs Acts," but this recommendation has not yet 
received the force of law. 

The commonest preservatives in use are boric acid or 
borates and formic aldehyde (formaldehyde). Sodium 
carbonate is sometimes added to restrain the formation of 
lactic acid. Salicylic acid, benzoates, salt, sulphites, fluor- 
ides, boro-glycerin, and hydrogen peroxide have all been 
used at various times. 

1. Borax and Boric Acid. The ash of the milk is treated 
with a little dilute HC1, so that it is distinctly but not 
strongly acid, and a piece of turmeric paper is placed in 
the liquid, and the dish is slightly warmed for a few minutes. 
The turmeric paper is removed and dried at a low tempera- 
ture. If even so small a quantity as o-oi per cent (i in 
10,000) of boric acid bs present it will produce on the paper 
a reddish colour when dry. On moistening with a drop 
of an alkaline solution the red turns a greenish black. 
Boric acid and borates are the only substances which will 
give this change of colour in an acid solution. 

Richmond's Test. Take equal quantities of the milk 
sample in two test tubes, and add N/io caustic soda to 
each, drop by drop, until a faint pink colour appears. To 
one tube add an equal quantity of water, and to the other 
the same quantity of neutral 50 per cent solution of gly- 
cerin. If boric acid be present, the latter tube will turn 
white, while in its absence both will remain the same colour. 

Another test is to take part of ash and add strong sul- 
phuric acid and some alcohol. Put in a dark place and 
light the alcohol, when in the presence of boric acid it 
burns with a green flame. 

2. Formaldehyde. (i) Hehner's test. Take 5 c.c. of milk 
in a test tube and add as much water. Some 90 per cent 



FOODS 81 

commercial sulphuric acid is then run down the side of the 
test tube, so that it forms a distinct layer at the bottom of 
the tube. Pure milk, free of formaldehyde, gives a greenish 
ring, but when formaldehyde is present a violet ring is 
formed. Pure sulphuric will not give the test, but will do 
so after the addition of a few drops of ferric chloride. The 
test, therefore, can be varied thus. To the dilute milk add 
the ferric chloride, and then some strong sulphuric, when 
the milk becomes a reddish-purple colour ; but carbolic 
and salicylic acids, if present, would give confusion colours. 
(Hehner's test reacts with i part in 200,000, but fails with 
milks containing overo -5 per cent). 

(2) Add a drop of carbolic acid to the dilute milk, and 
repeat Hehner's test, using pure H 2 SO 4 , when a red ring 
indicates the presence of formaldehyde. 

(3) Jorissen's Test. To 10 c.c. of milk in a tube are added 
several drops of a 10 per cent aqueous solution of phloro- 
glucinol, the mixture shaken, and a few drops of NaOH or 
KOH added. Normal milk gives no reaction, but a milk 
containing as little as i part of formalin in 20,000 gives a 
fleshy-pink coloration. 

(4) Distil 100 c.c. of the milk, and use the distillate for 
these tests. 

(a). Repeat test number (2) above. Detects i in 200,000. 

(b). Schiff's Magenta Test. Take a very dilute solution 
of magenta (fuchsin or nitrate of rosanilin), and decolorize 
with sulphurous acid, adding drop by drop. Add a few 
c.c. of distillate, and watch for some minutes (or set 
aside). Traces of formaldehyde bring back the colour 
slowly. The test is also said to be got in the nitrate of 
curdled milk. 

(c). Tatten-Thomson Test. To 20 c.c. of distillate add 
5 to 10 drops of a reagent made by adding ammonia to a 
2 per cent solution of silver nitrate until the precipitate 
first formed just dissolves. Set aside in a dark place for 
twenty-four hours. Darkening almost to blackness is due 
to formaldehyde, but a slight browning may be disregarded 
(often seen in silver solutions). 

Formalin is a 40 per cent solution of formic aldehyde 
(CH 2 O) in water. Two to three drops keep a pint of milk 
fresh for 3 to 4 days, and 0-05 per cent preserves milk for 

6 



82 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

months. In the milk trade a much more dilute solution 
is used, namely I of formalin in 80 of water (2 oz. per 
gallon) equal to 0-5 per cent of CH 2 O. Rideal states that 
one-fourth of a pint of such a solution in 17 to 18 gallons 
of milk (= i in 126 to 144) keeps the milk fresh for at least 
three days, and does not give it any taste or smell. This 
dilution is roughly I part of CH 2 O in 100,000. 

3. Salicylic Acid. Now rarely used in this country, is 
still largely employed on the Continent. It is best detected 
by Pellet's method : 100 c.c. of milk sample are diluted 
with as much distilled water, and heated to 60 C. ; I c.c. of 
acetic acid, and some mercuric nitrate are then added. 
The resulting curd is filtered off and rejected. The filtrate 
is repeatedly extracted with ether, the various extractions 
are mixed, a portion is evaporated, the residue dissolved in 
distilled water, and the solution tested with ferric chloride 
solution. A violet coloration not discharged by acetic 
acid, is positive. When present in considerable amount, 
the direct addition of ferric chloride gives a pale brown 
colour, and in the filtered whey a violet may be detected. 

4. Benzoates. Curdle the milk with acetic acid, extract 
the whey with chloroform, neutralize carefully after dilu- 
tion. Add ferric chloride, when benzoates give a buff- 
coloured precipitate insoluble in acetic acid. 

5. Sulphites. 

(1) Add dilute phosphoric acid and heat gently ; observe 
odour (SO 2 ). 

(2) Take 20 c.c. in a tube, add Zn and HC1. Place paper 
soaked in lead acetate solution over mouth of tube and heat 
latter gently. Darkening indicates presence of sulphites, 
but a negative result is more reliable. 

Hydrogen Peroxide. First suggested by Budde : milk 
said to be " Buddeized." To 10 c.c. of milk sample, add 
i c.c. of i per cent, ortol solution (freshly made), when in 
presence of hydroxyl a dull crimson colour is produced 
unless the milk has been heated above 72 C., when the 
addition of a little fresh milk is required. Paraphenylene- 
diamine similarly gives a blue coloration. Schardinger's 
reagent is decolorized by normal milk, but not by treated 
milk. In the presence of organic matter hydroxyl splits 



FOODS 83 

up slowly into water and free oxygen, and so after six to 
eight hours will not be found. 

Pasteurized Milk. By this term is meant milk which 
has been heated to a temperature sufficient to kill the less 
resistant pathogenic bacteria without altering the flavour. 
The temperature used varies from 70 to 85 C. (158 to 
185 F.). The higher temperature has been advised by 
Professor Bang. The one mostly used is 75 C. (167 F.) for 
half an hour, cooling quickly thereafter. Over 90 per cent 
of the organisms are killed, but the sporing forms are 
not destroyed. Souring of pasteurized milk does not take 
place owing to the destruction of the lactic acid bacilli. 
It does not keep for more than three days. 

Buddeized Milk. Fifteen c.c. of a 3 per cent solution 
of hydroxyl are added per litre of milk (i of H 2 O 2 in 2222), 
and the mixture heated for three hours at 51 C. (123-8 F.). 
Milk so treated is normal in taste, and keeps fresh for 
eight days, even in hot weather. 

Homogenized Milk. Under 200 to 400 atmospheres' 
pressure, milk is forced through very small openings, and 
the size of the fat globules reduced to o-ooi mm. in 
diameter. This prevents the fat from rising. Adams' 
process gives too low an estimate of fat in such milks. 

Dried Milk. By passing a thin layer of milk between 
two heated rollers, the milk is immediately desiccated and 
reduced to a fine powder, which merely requires the addi- 
tion of water to bring it back to the condition of ordinary 
milk. The temperature of the rollers is 110 C. (230 F.). 
Such milk may be lacking in the antiscorbutic properties 
necessary for infants, but appears to possess all the solids 
of the original milk in a sterile form. 

Humanized Cow's Milk. This is prepared on the large 
scale by diluting the milk with an equal quantity of pure 
water, and subjecting the mixture to centrifugalization. 
This divides it into two equal parts, one of which contains 
practically all the fat of the original milk, but only half of 
the other ingredients. The only constituent, therefore, 
notably deficient, will be the sugar, which is added in the 
proper proportion. The amount of proteid tends to be 



84 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

too low, and the mineral salts too high. Paget's Perfected 
Milk Food is a concentrated humanized milk of this class. 

Dirt in Milk. In Dresden, a standard of not more than 
8 mgr. per litre exists. In this country Dr. Houston has 
suggested (1905) two standards for dirt in milk : 
(i) Amount of filth that settles on standing to be less than 
100 mgr. per litre ; (2) This apparent filth is diluted 
with water and put in centrifuge, when amount of deposit 
should be less than 50 mgr. per litre. Otherwise expressed, 
(i) is 10 parts per 100,000, and (2) is 5 parts. 



CREAM : CONDENSED MILK : INFANTS' FOODS. 

Cream. The composition is similar to that of milk, 
but the fat is much higher in amount. No standard is laid 
down in this country ; but in the state of New Hampshire, 
cream must contain 18 per cent of fat. Cream is at times 
thickened by the addition of such agents as gelatin, starch 
paste, saccharate of lime (called viscogen), and condensed 
milk. 

Colouring with annatto and coal-tar dyes is known. 
Annatto may be detected by adding bicarbonate of sodium, 
and then immersing a strip of white filter-paper and stand- 
ing overnight. A brown stain indicates the presence of 
annatto. Coal-tar dyes of the azo group give a pink colour 
with diluted mineral acids. 

Fat is estimated by the Leffmann-Beam process : 
2 grams, of cream are mixed with 12 c.c. of water, and the 
mixture is poured into the bottle, the remainder of the 
procedure being as before (page 75). The result is multi- 
plied by 7-77. The Werner-Schmidt and Adams' processes 
may also be used. 

The Departmental Committee on Preservatives advised 
that only borax and boracic acid be allowed in cream, and 
in an amount not exceeding 0-25 per cent, expressed as 
boric acid ; and the amount to be notified by a label 
affixed. 

Cream prepared by centrifugalizing methods contains 
45 to 65 per cent of fat. Devonshire, Cornish, or clotted 
cream is prepared by warming milk in pans for several 



FOODS 85 

hours. The cream rises in a more coherent layer (50 to 60 
per cent of fat). 

Condensed Milk. Consists of unsweetened milk or 
sweetened milk or sweetened skimmed milk, concentrated 
by evaporation, usually to one-third of its volume. The 
addition of two volumes of water should, therefore, produce 
a strength equal to the original. 

The unsweetened milks are well prepared, keep well, and 
contain the due proportion of fat. 

The sweetened milks form the largest class, and for the 
most part are good. The dilutions recommended in 
nearly every case produce a milk very much below the 
standard of ordinary milk. Such milks usually contain 
rather more cane sugar than milk solids. For example (a 
good specimen) : Fat n per cent, proteins 10 per cent, 
milk sugar 14 per cent, ash 2-2 per cent, and cane sugar 
38 per cent. (Solids not cane sugar, n -f- 10 + 14 = 35 
per cent.) 

The sweetened skimmed milks, or separated milks, or 
machine-skimmed milks, are very inferior to the above, 
containing as little as 0-2 per cent of fat, and generally 
about only i per cent. Such milk is unfit for the sole 
nourishment of children ; and it would be better if such a 
statement had to be put on the label. * 

ANALYSIS. Mix the contents of the tin well, weigh out 
10 grm., dissolve in water, and make up the bulk to 
100 c.c. Analyse as in the case of ordinary milk, except 
that for fat the Werner-Schmidt method is inapplicable in 
sweetened milks, owing to the charring of the cane sugar. 
In the Adams' process use carbon tetrachloride instead 
of ether. 

Humanized Condensed Milk. This is a condensed 
milk with added milk sugar and cream, but no cane sugar. 
When diluted with water in the proper proportion it is 
practically identical in quantitative composition with 
human milk. 

Infant Foods. These are sold as a substitute for 
mother's milk. As they are in the dried state, their 
composition should approximate to that of dried mother's 
milk, which, according to Hutchison, is as follows :

Most of these substitutes are deficient in fat, some are 
deficient in proteid, and many of them contain unaltered 
starch. They may be divided into three groups : 

1. Cow's milk desiccated, with additions or alterations. 
These only require the addition of water. Includes Allen- 
bury (Nos. i and 2), Horlick's malted milk, Carnrick's 
soluble food, Milo food, Manhu infant food, and Maltico. 
They are all deficient in fat and too rich in carbohydrate. 
The first three and the last contain no unaltered starch. 

2. Cereals, usually wheat, of which the starch has been 
partly or wholly transformed into dextrins or malt sugar. 
In Mellin's food, Cheltine maltose food, and Hovis babies' 
food (No. i), all the carbohydrate is in a soluble form in the 
powder, and there is no starch present. In Savory & 
Moore's food and Allenburys' malted food, the powder con- 
sists of wheat flour mixed with malt. When prepared 
according to the directions, most but not all of the starch 
is converted into soluble forms. Benger's food is a mixture 
of wheat flour and pancreatic extract, and in it, too, most 
but not all of the starch is converted into soluble forms. 
The proteid is also partially digested. These are all made 
with milk, or milk and water. 

3. Cereals, wheat flour, oats, and barley, with the starch 
unaltered. To some, sugar has been added. Made with 
milk, or milk and water. Such are Ridge's food, Neave's 
food, Frame food, Scott's oat flour, Robinson's patent 
barley and groats, etc. 

ANALYSIS. Examine for starch (microscope). Total 
nitrogen, by Kjeldahl X 5-7 = proteid. Phosphates, sugar, 
starch, dextrin, and cold water extract : see under CEREALS 
and WHEAT FLOUR. Fat, estimate by Soxhlet, or with 
petroleum ether (see under COFFEE).

BUTTER. 

Butter is the fat of milk clotted together by shaking or 
beating at a low temperature. A thin bluish fluid separates, 
which is called buttermilk. Butter consists of neutral fats 
mixed with water, a small amount of casein, and traces of 
salts, and there may be added salt (NaCl). The average 
composition is : Fat, 78 to 94 per cent ; water, 8 to 12 per 
cent ; curd, i to 3 per cent ; salt, o to 7 per cent. The fats 
are present as glycerides of certain fatty acids, namely : 
butyric, caproic, caprylic, capric, myristic, palmitic, 
steanc, and oleic acids. The first four are soluble in hot 
water, and are known as the " soluble fatty acids," the 
rest as the " insoluble fatty acids." Bell's analysis of 
butter fat is : butyric acid, 6-1 per cent ; caproic, caprylic, 
and capric acids, 2-* per cent ; myristic, palmitic, and 
stearic acids, 49-4 per cent ; oleic acid, 36-1 per cent ; 
glycerol (calculated), 12-5 per cent. These are present chiefly 
as tributyrin, tripalmitin, and triolein (: C 3 H 5 (O-C 4 H -O) 3 : 
C 3 H 5 (O.C 16 H 31 0) 3 : C 3 H 5 (O.C 18 H 33 0) 3 :). 

ADULTERATIONS. The important ones are : Addition 
of water in excess, the substitution of foreign fats, salt in 
excess, starch, boric acid. 

EXAMINATION OF BUTTER FOR WATER, SALT, CURD, 
FAT, AND BORIC ACID. 

The fat is further examined by the Valenta test, for 
specific gravity, for volatile fatty acids, for fixed fatty 



88 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

acids, refractive index, iodine absorption, and foreign 
oils. Butter may also be examined for starch, annatto, or 
other colourings, benzoic and salicylic acids, and with the 
polariscope. 

Water. Weigh 2 grm. of butter into a weighed 
capsule, and dry in the water-oven to constant weight. 
The drying may be expedited by adding 1-5 c.c. of absolute 
alcohol after melting the butter in the water-oven. The 
amount of water should not exceed 16 per cent (" Butter 
Regulations," 1902). The same standard now applies to 
margarine (" Butter and Margarine Act," 1907). 

Salt. The residue, after burning off the fat and curd 
from the dried butter, may for all practical purposes be 
taken as salt. Or, melt 2 grm. of butter in some hot 
water, make up the bulk to 200 c.c. with hot water, and put 
into a separating funnel. Allow fat to separate to top, 
take 20 c.c. of the clear liquid, titrate with standard silver 
nitrate solution, and calculate result in terms of NaCl. It 
rarely exceeds 10 per cent. Often high in Irish butter. 

Curd or Casein. Varies from 0-3 to 4 per cent. It is 
usually calculated by difference. 

Fat. The amount of fat may be estimated in a Soxhlet 
apparatus, using a prepared thimble made of filter-paper ; 
or by washing the dried solids with ether. For the other 
processes the fat is separated by filling a Nessler glass with 
butter, and melting on the water-bath. The fat gradually 
rises to the top, and the water and curd sink, so that three 
layers are noted ; fat, curd, and water. The fat is now 
filtered through a dry filter-paper placed in a funnel sur- 
rounded with hot water. Care is taken not to pour any 
of the wet curd or water on to the paper. The water-free 
fat is then used for the various processes. 

i. Reichert-W ollny Process for the estimation of the 
volatile fatty acids. 

Five grms. of the liquid fat are introduced into a 300 c.c. 
boiling-flask ; 2 c.c. of 50 per cent NaOH solution (free from 
CO 2 ), and 10 c.c. of 92 per cent alcohol, are added. The 
mixture is heated for fifteen minutes (under a reflux con- 
denser) on the water-bath kept at 100 C. The fats are 
thus saponified. Remove the condenser, and continue the 



FOODS 89 

heating for half an hour, or until the soap is dry. This is 
to get rid of the alcohol. Freshly boiled aq. dest. is 
added cautiously, while still hot, to the amount of TOO c.c., 
and the flask carefully heated until the soap is dissolved. 
Thereafter, 40 c.c. of N/i H 2 SO 4 are added, and 3 to 4 
pieces of pumice stone, and the flask is rapidly connected 
to a condenser by a tube having a bulb. Heat at first with 
a small flame to melt the insoluble fatty acids (liberated 
with the soluble fatty acids by the action of the sulphuric 
acid), but do not boil. When fusion is complete, increase 
the heat, and distil over no c.c. in thirty minutes. Shake 
the distillate, filter 100 c.c., add 0-5 c.c. of i per cent 
phenolphthalein solution, and titrate with N/io soda or 
baryta. The number of c.c. used X i-i is called the 
Reichert-Wollny number, and for genuine butter varies 
from 24 to 32. A blank experiment, using the reagents 
alone, supplies a correction for any acidity due to these. 

This is an official process, recognized by the Government 
Laboratory and the Society of Public Analysts. Sundry 
details are given in the official description, such as the 
length of neck of flask, size of tubes and condenser, etc., 
all to secure uniformity of method and apparatus and so 
give comparable results. When the Reichert-Wollny figure 
has been got, if it is 24 or above, the sample is looked 
upon as genuine, and as i c.c. N/io soda = 0-0088 grm., 
or 8-8 mgr. of butyric acid, the percentage of soluble volatile 
fatty acids returned as butyric acid is easily calculated. 
With the Reichert-Wollny varying from 24 to 32, the per- 
centage of acid will vary from 4-2 per cent to 5-6 per cent. 

Pure Margarine Fats give a Reichert-Wollny figure of 
0-2 to i per cent. As a maximum of 10 per cent of butter- 
fat is allowed to be added for flavouring purposes, the 
maximum Reichert-Wollny figure for a saleable margarine 
will be i + 10 per cent of 32 (= 3-2), or 4-2. The figure 
usually taken is 3. If a butter gives a Reichert-Wollny 
of say y, let x stand for the percentage of margarine, 
then 3 x x + 24 (ioo-#) = y x 100 ; or x = (2400 -looy) 

-f- 21. 

Unfortunately for the value of this process, vegetable 
fats which give a moderate Reichert-Wollny figure are now 
being used for food. Thus coco-nut oil has a Reichert- 



90 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

Wollny of 7, palm-nut fat of 5, and certain fish oils are 
said to give values above 40. In the case of coco-nut oil, 
the figure is due to the presence of the glyceride of caprylic 
acid, with a little caproic, but no butyric glyceride. To 
meet this difficulty, several tests have been devised. Here 
we describe that of Polenske, which is the most generally 
adopted one. 

Polenske Method. Is based on a determination of the 
insoluble volatile fatty acids, which are distilled over in 
the Reichert-Wollny process. Certain arbitrary condi- 
tions must be observed to get results which will be compar- 
able with those of Polenske and others. 

PROCESS. Five grm. of the fat, 20 grm. of glycerol, 
and 2 c.c. of 50 per cent NaOH (an alcoholic solution of 
soda must not be used) are taken in a 300 c.c. boiling-flask, 
and heated over a naked flame, with constant shaking, until 
a clear solution is obtained. The soap formed is dissolved 
carefully in 90 c.c. of hot water ; 50 c.c. of N/i sulphuric 
acid are added ; and o-i grm. of pumice, which has been 
powdered and then sifted through muslin. The flask is 
quickly connected to the top of an upright Liebig con- 
denser, by means of a glass tube with a bulb just above 
the cork, and the tube thereafter bent, first at an obtuse, 
and then at an acute, angle. Distillation is commenced, 
and the flame so regulated that no c.c. are distilled over in 
nineteen to twenty-one minutes. When no c.c. have been 
received into a small flask, the latter is replaced by a 25 c.c. 
cylinder, and the flame withdrawn. The cylinder receives 
the drainings. The flask containing the no c.c. of 
distillate is, without shaking the contents, put into a 
bath of water at 10 C. for ten minutes, the level of the 
water outside being just above that of the distillate inside 
the flask. (At this stage, it may be noted that the insoluble 
fatty acids are almost invariably opaque and white in the 
case of butter, while 10 per cent or more of coco-nut oil 
gives clear oily globules.) The distillate flask is now 
shaken, and the contents are filtered. The Reichert figure 
may be obtained on 100 c.c. of the filtrate. The filter- 
paper is kept ; and the distillate flask, the condenser, and 
the cylinder are washed out with 18 c.c. of distilled water, 
which is then poured on to the filter-paper. This paper 



FOODS 91 

now contains all the insoluble volatile fatty acids which 
have distilled over. These are dissolved in alcohol, and 
the solution is titrated with N /io baryta + phth. The 
number of c.c. required is called the " new butter value " 
of the fat. This varies with the Reichert figure, being 1-3 
where the Reichert is 20, and 3-0 where the Reichert is 30. 
An increase of o-i in the new butter value corresponds to 
an addition of i per cent of coco-nut oil. The mode of 
calculation is thus : The new butter, value of a pure 
butter having the same Reichert figure is subtracted 
from the new butter value of the sample. The difference 
multiplied by io gives the percentage of coco-nut oil 
present. Ten per cent and under is not detectable with 
certainty. (See article on " The Estimation of Coco-nut 
Gil in Butter-fat," by F. W. Harris, F.I.C., in the Analyst, 
November, 1906.) 

Insoluble or Fixed Fatty Acids. About 5 grm. of the 
fat are taken in a flat porcelain dish or in a flask, melted on 
the water-bath, and 50 c.c. of methylated spirit or absolute 
alcohol added. A clear yellow solution is formed. Now 
add 2 grm. of NaOH or KOH, and continue the heating, 
stirring all the while. The fats are saponified. In five 
minutes add a few drops of water ; if turbidity ensues, all 
the fat has not been saponified ; continue the heating. 
Repeat until no turbidity ensues. (If too much water is 
added, some of the fat may be precipitated from solution. 
In that case add more alcohol.) Continue to heat until all 
the alcohol is evaporated and a jelly of soap remains. 
Then add water, almost filling the dish, and in this the soap 
dissolves. Dilute HC1 is now added until strongly acid, 
and the fatty acids are thus liberated. Heat for half an 
hour on the water-bath, filter through a weighed filter- 
paper (5 inches diameter) placed in a hot-water jacket, 
washing all the fatty acids from the dish with repeated 
amounts of boiling water, until the filtrate is no longer acid. 
The insoluble fatty acids remain on the filter-paper. They 
are solidified by putting cold water in the jacket. The 
paper is then carefully removed, placed in a small 
weighed beaker, and dried for two hours, and then the 
beaker and contents are weighed. The percentage of 
insoluble fatty acids in the butter fat is then calculated, 



92 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

and ranges from 86-3 to 88-5, on average about 87-3. All 
other animal fats give an average of 95-3. 

Valenta Test. Depends on the intermiscibility of butter 
fat and strong acetic acid at a low temperature, whereas 
animal and vegetable fats (except coco-nut oil) do not 
mix until a much higher temperature is reached. Glacial 
acetic acid (99 per cent) is used. Take a test tube and add 
3 c.c. of the fat and 3 c.c. of the acid. Immerse it in hot 
water to heat the contents, which are stirred all the while 
by a thermometer. If the sample is pure butter fat, it will 
have cleared at 40 C., and it is then allowed to cool, still 
stirring, and the temperature noted on the first appearance 
of turbidity. For butter fat this should be from 32 to 36 C. 
Margarine fat will not clear under 75 C. An abnormally 
low Valenta figure suggests the presence of coco-nut oil. * 

Specific Gravity of Butter Fat. Is now seldom taken at 
ordinary temperatures, it being more convenient to take 
it with the fat in a molten state, at 100 F. The fat at 
110 F. is poured into an ordinary specific-gravity bottle, 
which is then placed in water at 100 F. The stopper is 
pushed home, and the bottle dried, cooled, and weighed. 
The weight of the same bulk of water at 100 F. is similarly 
ascertained, and the specific gravity calculated. Pure butter 
fat ranges from 910-7 to 913-5, but mostly between 911 and 
913. Margarine fat ranges from 901-5 to 906, at 100 F. 
The specific gravity is also taken at 100 C. by the Sprengel 
tube or the Westphal balance, and ranges thus : Margarine, 
856 to 860 ; butter, 865-3 to 866-8 ; coco-nut oil, 868 to 
872 compared with water at 15-5 C. 

Refractive Index. Is determined on a special instrument. 
At 35 C. it varies for butter from 44 to 49, generally 46. 
Margarine gives about 54, and coco-nut oil about 43. 
Its use is less valuable now than formerly. 

Boric Acid. Is detected in the ash, as in the case of 
milk. In order to prevent loss when ashing, a few drops of 
milk-of-lime solution should first be added. To estimate, 
take 25 grm. of butter in a beaker, add 25 c.c. of a solution 
of lactose (6 per cent) and sulphuric acid (4 c.c. of N/i 
per cent). Melt in water-oven, mix by stirring, allow to 
settle, and pipette off 20 c.c. of the aqueous portion. 
Titrate at 100 C. plus phth. with N/2 NaOH, until a faint 



FOODS 



93 



pink appears. Then add 12 c.c. of glycerol, when boric 
acid is li berated and pink disappears. Titrate again ; 
note number of c.c. used, and the difference x 0-0368- 
gives amount of boric acid in 20 c.c. This X (100 -f- per- 
centage of water in butter) -f- 20 = percentage. 

Saponification Equivalent of Koettstorfer for butter 
fat varies from 242 to 253, and for margarine fat the mean 
figure is about 284. The saponification of oils by alkalies 
is a definite reaction, and may be represented by the 
following general equation where F stands for the radicle 
of the fatty acid : C 3 H 5 (OF) 3 + 3KOH = C 3 H 5 (OH) 3 
+ 3KOF. Therefore, if we know exactly the amount of 
alkali necessary to saponify the oil under examination, 
we can to some extent determine the nature of the glycerides 
present. The amount of alkali required varies with the 
composition of the fatty acids ; the lower the molecular 
weight, the higher \\ill be the amount of soda or potash 
needed to saponify. This amount may be stated in three 
ways : (i) As a percentage, that is, the number of grammes 
of alkali absorbed per 100 grm. of fat ; (2) The number 
of milligrammes of alkali absorbed per i grm. of fat. This 
is called the saponification value, and the figure for it is 
ten times the percentage, since it is parts per thousand ; 
and (3) As the number of grammes of fat which would be 
saponified by i litre of normal alkali ; that is, in the case 
of potash, by 56 grm. of alkali. This is called the 
saponification equivalent, and may be got by dividing the 
percentage of alkali absorbed into 5600, or if the exact 
atomic weights are used, with oxygen = 16 as the basis, 
into 5610. The following table from Moor & Partridge 
summarizes these facts, in regard to the chief fats :

PROCESS. Weigh 2 grm. of sample into a 200 c.c. 
flask, add 25 c.c., approximately, N/2 (seminormal) 
alcoholic solution of KOH. A like amount of KOH 
solution is run into an empty flask for a blank experiment. 
The flasks are fitted with corks carrying vertical tubes 
4 ft. long to act as condensers. Both flasks are then 
heated on the water-bath for not less than thirty minutes, 
with frequent agitation. Thereafter a few drops of phth. 
are added to each flask, and both are titrated with exactly 
N/2 HC1 solution, i c.c. of which = 0-02805 grn*- KOH; 
therefore the difference between the two titrations, 
multiplied by this factor, gives the amount of KOH taken 
up by the oil, and from this the percentage is easily 
calculated, and the Sn value and the Sn equivalent. The 
Sn value shows the number of milligrammes of KOH 
required to saponify I grm. of the oil, since 55-7 per cent 
equals 557 per 1000, or 557 mgr. per I grm. 

Iodine absorption of butter fat ranges from 23 to 38 per 
cent, and for margarine from 40 to 55 per cent, but is not 
of much value in determining the amount of foreign fat 
in butter. The fats of the oleic series readily unite with 
a definite quantity of I, Br, or Cl, the others being 
indifferent. 

Sesame Oil. To 10 c.c. of fat sample add 10 c.c. strong 
HC1 containing o-i grm. of cane sugar. Shake thoroughly 
and allow to stand, when in the presence of even 2 per cent 
of sesame oil, the aqueous liquid becomes crimson coloured. 

Cotton-seed Oil. Mix equal volumes of the fat and a 
saturated solution of Pb acetate, add AmOH and stir 
quickly. On standing, the surface layer turns an orange- 
red colour. 

Starch. Melt sample in a small beaker or tube, pour off 
fat, and add KI solution to water and curd. Normal 
butter gives a reddish coloration only, while a very small 
trace of starch will give a blue. Examine curd 
microscopically. 

Polariscope. Pure butter (using gaslight) on rotation, 
so that the two Nicol prisms are at right angles, gives the 
whole field equally dark. If 20 per cent or over of 
margarine is present, it is impossible to darken the whole 
field, no matter how the prisms be placed, but a cloudy 



POODS 95 

appearance is got. No selenite plate should be used, and 
the butter should not have been melted. 

Annatto and, other Colouring Matters. If the colouring 
matter of a butter can be extracted with alcohol, foreign 
colours are present, as the natural colouring matter is not 
soluble in alcohol. Annatto may be detected by extraction 
with methyl alcohol and carbon disulphide. The latter 
dissolves the fat and sinks, the alcohol dissolves the colour 
and floats. Separate alcohol and evaporate : yellow stain, 
which turns blue-green on adding a drop of strong sulphuric. 
Turmeric, saffron, saffronette, marigold, and the azo dyes 
are also used. 

Butter v. Margarine. 

1. Digest fat of sample with alcoholic solution NaOH, 
when butter gives pleasant odour of butyric ether or 
pineapples, and pure margarine gives a tallow smell. 

2. Burn a small piece of sample on platinum foil and 
extinguish flame : butter, rather pleasant smell ; 
margarine, tallow smeh 1 . 

3. Melting-point of fat. Take a platinum loopful, dip 
in water alongside thermometer, and heat until fat just 
translucent : butter fat, 30 to 35 C. ; margarine fat, rarely 
above 28 C ; coco-nut oil, 20 Q -26 C. 

4. Valenta test. 

CHEESE. 

Cheese is made from milk by the action of rennet, and 
consists of coagulated casein with varying proportions of 
water, fat, and salts. It may be made from whole milk 
(Cheddar, Cheshire, Gloucester, and some American 
cheeses), from skimmed milk (Dutch, Parmesan, Suffolk, 
and Somerset cheeses), from whole milk and cream (Stilton). 
Parmesan is made from goat's milk (partly skimmed) ; 
Roquefort from ewe's milk (partly skimmed) ; and Gorgon- 
zola by adding in the process of manufacture, powdered bread 
crusts on which moulds have been allowed to grow. Cream 
cheese consists of the fresh curd which has been moderately 
pressed, and is eaten before being allowed to ripen. 
" Ripening " of cheese is supposed to be a decomposition 
whereby the casein undergoes a fatty change with the 



96 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

formation of lime salts of the fatty acids, and a soluble 
compound of phosphoric acid with the casein. Average 
composition of Cheddar cheese per cent : water 33-9, 
ash 4-2, fat 30, nitrogen 4-3, casein 27-3. Water is very 
high in cream cheeses, which are also very deficient in fat, 
in nitrogen, and in casein. The Reichert figure for the fat 
of cheese is, from its similar origin, the same as that for 
butter fat. There is no standard for cheese in this country, 
and a cream cheese can be purchased containing less fat 
than a milk one, unless double cream be asked for. A good 
standard would be not less than 30 per cent of true butter 
fat and no starch or other extraneous matter : for cream 
cheese, a 40 per cent standard. U.S.A. standard : 50 per 
cent milk fat in dried solids. 

Analysis. Moisture : dry 2 to 5 grm. of sample cut 
in thin slices, to constant weight in water-oven at 105 C. 
(absolute alcohol hurries drying). 

Ash. Ignite dried cheese at as low a temperature as 
possible. 

Nitrogen. Treat I grm. of sample by the Kjeldahl 
process. N x 6-38 = proteins. 

Fat. Take dried cheese, put into filter-paper thimble, 
and extract in Soxhlet for two hours ; or grind 50 grm. 
of sample in a mortar with sand, put mixture in tall 
stoppered cylinder and extract with four portions of ether, 
using in all about 500 c.c. Make to a definite volume, 
take aliquot part, evaporate to dryness, and weigh residue. 
Or by Leffman-Beam. 

Reichert-W ollny Process. Extract fat by melting in 
water-oven. 

Poisonous Metals in Rind. Lead, copper, and arsenic 
have been found in rind. 

Salt 5 to 6 per cent ; tyro-toxicon, acarus domesticus, 
moulds. 

CEREALS I WHEAT-FLOUR I BREAD. 

The cereals consist of the edible grains, such as wheat, 
oats, barley, rye, maize, rice, millet, and buckwheat. 
From these, various products are got which are largely 
used for food ; as wheat flour, oatmeal, barley meal, pearl 
barley, rye flour, corn flour (from maize or Indian corn), 



FOODS 97 

buckwheat flour, flaked rice, ground rice, rice flour, hominy 
(split maize). The proteid varies in the different cereals. 
Wheat flour has the largest proportion of gluten, and 
therefore makes the best bread. Cane sugar is found in 
all cereals. 

The analysis of these consists in estimating the moisture, 
ash, fat, phosphoric acid, total nitrogen, and proteids ; 
sugar, starch and dextrin, cellulose, extract and acidity, 
and true albuminoids. 

Phosphoric Acid. Dissolve ash in diluted HC1, boil and 
filter. Precipitate lime with Am 2 C 2 O 4 , filter after heating 
on water-bath for one hour, and precipitate phosphoric acid 
from filtrate with AmCl, AmOH, and MgCl 2 . Stand for 
twelve hours, filter, dry, ignite, and weigh as magnesium 
pyrophosphate Mg 2 P 2 O 7 . 

Sugar, Starch and Dextrin. Take 5 grm., and boil with 
250 c.c. aqua and 50 c.c. N /i HC1 under an invert condenser 
for six hours. If hydrolysis of starch is complete, a drop 
of the solution will give no blue colour with iodine solution. 
Neutralize with 50 c.c. N/i NaOH, filter into a litre flask, 
and with washings make up to the mark. Estimate with 
Fehling's solution, either volumetrically or gravimetrically. 
The Pavy-Fehling method is more reliable than the ordinary 
way. Pavy's solution is made from Fehling's thus : 
120 c.c. of Fehling are taken, and 300 c.c. strong AmOH 
(sp. gr. 0-880) and 400 c.c. NaOH solution (12 per cent) 
are added, and the volume is made up to i litre ; 100 c.c. 
of this solution has the same oxidizing effect on glucose as 
10 c.c. of ordinary Fehling solution, that is, 100 c.c = 0-05 
grm. glucose. The cuprous oxide is not precipitated in 
the presence of ammonia, and the titration is continued 
until the solution is colourless. In working, take a 300 c.c. 
boiling-flask fitted with a two-holed stopper. Through one 
hole goes the nose of the burette containing the dilute sugar 
solution, and through the other a tube to lead away the 
ammonia ; 50 c.c. of the Pavy solution are taken in the 
flask and brought to the boil. The sugar solution is then 
run in slowly from the burette till the blue colour is dis- 
charged. To convert glucose to starch X 0-9.

Aspergillus and Penicillium ; Acarus farina. 

Wheat Flour. Examine microscopically, physically, 
and practically (by making bread). Should be white in 
colour, silky to touch, free from smell or odour, and not 
yellow or gritty. Moisture : dry 5 grm. in water-oven 
(should not exceed 18 per cent). Ash : ignite (not more 
than i per cent). Total proteid, from Kjeldahl N x 6-25 
(not less than 8 per cent). Cold-water extract, (10 per cent) 
(should not exceed 4-7 per cent). Acidity, none. 

Glutin. The proteins consist chiefly of a globulin and 
an albumose which, when acted on by water, unite to form 
glutin (from gliadin and glutinin). Estimate thus : weigh 
10 grm. of flour and put into a porcelain dish. Add pure 
water from a burette, stirring the while with a glass rod 
so as to make a well-mixed dough. Be careful to add the 
water slowly, using about 4 c.c. When made, let the 
dough stand for fifteen minutes, then pour a little water 
on and stir about with the rod to let the water wash out 
the starch. Repeat until washings are free from starch, 
as tested by iodine. (After a time the glutin becomes so 
coherent that it can be worked with the fingers.) Dry, and 
weigh. If time does not permit of drying, weigh moist 
glutin and divide weight by 2-9. Dry glutin ranges from 
8 per cent to 12 per cent (reject if below 8 per cent). 

Cold Water Extract. Weigh 20 grm. into a dry flask, 
add 200 c.c. aq. dest., and shake for five minutes. Allow 
to stand twenty-five minutes. Decant off clear liquid and 
filter through a dry paper. Evaporate 50 c.c. in water- 
oven to constant weight, and this gives total soluble 
extract, consisting of sugar, gum, dextrin, soluble albumin, 
and phosphate of potash. Ignite, and weigh ash, which 
is phosphate of potash. The acidity (if any) can be 
determined by using 100 c.c. of the cold-water extract. 

Mineral Matter. Shake 100 grm. of the flour with 
200 c.c. of chloroform in a separator. Allow to stand, when 



FOODS 99 

the flour floats to the top and any mineral matter sinks to 
the bottom. Draw off, dry, weigh, and examine micro- 
scopically. Any soluble matter can be dissolved and tested 
for alum, while the insoluble can be tested for CaSO 4 , 
BaSO 4 , and CaCO 3 . To test for alum : add NaOH, white 
precipitate solution in excess of NaOH, but re-precipitated 
on adding AmCl. The sulphuric acid present in alum is pre- 
cipitated by barium chloride ; precipitate insoluble in HC1. 

Bleaching of Flour. Chiefly with nitrogen peroxide 
(NO 2 ), produced by the action of HNO 3 on FeSO 4 , or 
combustion of NH 3 in air, or by electric sparks. The 
NO 2 with the moisture in the flour forms nitric and nitrous 
acids, the latter of which is readily demonstrated in a 10 
per cent watery extract by the Ilosvay method (page 48) . 
(i to 3 parts as N per million). (See Hamill and Monier- 
\Villiams, Journal of Hygiene, vol. xi, No. 2, July, 1911). 

Alum. Make 10 grm. of flour into a paste with 10 c.c. 
of water. Add i c.c. of each of two solutions, namely, 
(i) Fresh tincture of logwood, and (2) Saturated solution 
of ammonium carbonate. Mix well with a glass rod. If 
the flour is free from alum, the mixture is a pinkish colour 
fading to a dirty bro\vn. If alum is present, the pink 
changes to a lavender tint or even to a blue. In such a 
case the sample should be put in the water-oven for two 
hours to make sure that the colour is permanent. 

Adulterations. Those mentioned under cereals; water; 
" improvers " ; also foreign seeds. One of these, the purple 
cow-wheat (Melampyrum arvense), is not injurious, but 
gives bread from the flour a smoky-violet or bluish-violet 
tint. Two others, the corn-cockle (Agrostemma githago) 
and darnel seeds (Lolium temulentum) possess toxic powers. 
The corn-cockle is detected by its appearance as large 
black seeds, while the darnel seeds are detected by the 
repulsive taste they give to the flour and the greenish 
colour produced on the addition of alcohol (pure flour 
gives a straw-coloured solution with a more or less agree- 
able taste). Darnel seeds do not affect the colour of the 
bread, but produce in those eating it, vertigo, hallucina- 
tions, delirium, and narcosis. 

Bread is made by kneading wheat flour with water, the 
coherence of the dough being due to the moist glutin 



100 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

formed. The porosity of bread, which is essential to its 
easy digestion, is produced by enclosing in the dough 
minute bubbles of carbonic acid gas. This is accomplished 
in one of three ways, viz. : 

1. By the use of yeast which sets up fermentation of a 
small portion of the starch, forming alcohol and carbonic 
acid gas. 

2. By the use of baking-powders containing an acid salt 
and a bicarbonate, which on being moistened give off 
carbonic acid gas. 

3. By kneading the dough with water charged with 
carbonic acid gas under pressure (Dauglish's system), 
so-called " aerated bread." 

The " germ," an important constituent of the grain, and 
rich in fat and proteid, is removed in modern milling 
processes, and its absence makes the flour whiter. 

ANALYSIS. In sampling, take crumb and crust. 

Moisture. Take 10 to 50 grm. and dry to constant 
weight in water-oven (should not exceed 40 per cent). 

Ash. Take 10 grm. of bread, moisten with strong 
solution of ammonium nitrate, dry, and carefully ignite. 
If ash is still very carbonaceous, repeat, and a clean ash 
will usually be obtained (should not exceed 2 per cent, and 
part insoluble in HC1 should not exceed 0-2 per cent). 

Alum. Take 10 grm. of bread free from crust, in a dish. 
Pour over them 100 c.c. of water containing 5 c.c. each 
of the logwood and ammonium carbonate solutions 
described above. Stand for five minutes, drain off excess 
of liquid, and dry in dish at iooC. Violet or blue tint if 
alum is present ; if not, a brown or buff. Detects 7 grains 
in a 4-lb. loaf. Test unreliable when bread is sour. 

Acidity. Soak 10 grm. of bread in 100 c.c. of aq. dest. 
for one hour, macerate, and then titrate with N /io NaOH 
and return result in terms of acetic acid : i c.c. N /io 
NaOH = 0-006 grm. glacial acetic (part of the acidity is 
due to lactic acid). Some extract with hot water, or digest 
on water-bath and filter a portion. Use phenolphthalein 
as indicator. Should be less than 0-115 P er cent or 8 gr. 
per Ib. Alum test is unreliable when the bread is sour. 

Copper Sulphate has been detected in bread, probably 
due to the corn having been steeped in a copper solution to 



FOODS 101 

prevent a growth of fungus. It is detected by soaking in a 
solution of K 4 FeCy 6 , acidulated with acetic, when a purplish 
or reddish-brown coloration indicates the presence of copper. 

Ergot in Flour. (i) Microscope ; (2) Place some 
flour in a test tube, and a few c.c. 10 per cent KOH, and 
warm gently : smell of propylamine (like warm urinous 
napkin) ; (3) Shake up 2 grm. of flour with 10 c.c. of 
alcohol (70 per cent) containing i /2 c.c. HC1. On standing, 
a red colour slowly forms. 

Baking-Powders. Definition : " A baking-powder may 
be defined as a salt or mixture of salts with or without a 
diluent such as starch, which evolves carbon dioxide when 
moistened, and on heating " (Moor). The Sale of Food and 
Drugs Act, 1899, enables authorities to take cognizance 
of the constitution of a baking-powder as an article which 
" ordinarily enters into or is used in the composition or 
preparation of human food." 

The best mixture is one containing the proper chemical 
proportions of good cream of tartar (KHC 4 H 4 O 6 ) and 
baking soda (NaHCO 3 ), with a filling of about 20 per cent 
of pure starch. The chemical action forms rochelle salt 
(KNaC 4 H 4 O 6 ). This keeps well, reacts slowly and in a 
definite way ; and the rochelle salt formed has a very 
weak retarding action on ferments, and so does not disturb 
the digestive processes. 

Alum is objectionable from inhibiting the digestive 
ferments, precipitating the phosphoric acid and phosphates, 
and liberating sulphate of soda, which is purgative. 
Bisulphate of potash also liberates the last-named salt. 

Tartaric acid and acid phosphate of lime liberate the CO 2 
too quickly. 

Ammonium carbonate and superphosphate of lime (free 
from sulphate) are not objectionable. 

Available carbon dioxide should be at least 8 per cent 
by weight. 
KHC 4 H 4 O 6 + NaHCO 3 = KNaC 4 H 4 O 6 + H 2 O + CO 2 . 

Numerous prosecutions for the presence of alum have 
been made. 

STARCHES. 

Take a clean slide, and put on it a small drop of water. 
With a platinum loop, transfer a portion of the starch 



102 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

powder to the water-drop, and mix. Put on a cover-glass, 
remove excess of water, and examine with a microscope, 
using first a f inch objective and then a inch. Observe 
carefully the following points : (i) Shape ; (2) Size ; (3) 
Hilum (presence or absence of) ; (4) Slriations (presence or 
absence of). Iodine solution sho\vs up the striae, (i-iooo). 
Starches fall into five groups : 

1. Contour round the wheat group wheat, barley, 
and rye. These all have grains large and minute (rye has 
also intermediary sizes, as also has barley to a less 
extent), and have no very apparent hilum or striae. 

2. Contour oval pea, bean, and lentil. These all have 
grains of large size with a longitudinal hilum, with very 
faint striae. 

3. Contour ovoid potato and arrowroot. Large granules, 
with a distinct hilum and well-marked concentric rings or 
striae. The hilum is at the smaller end (oyster shape) in 
potato, and at the other end in arrowroot, the granules of 
which are smaller (except tous-les-mois variety). 

4. Contour semi-faceted sago and tapioca. These have 
a hilum and ill-defined rings. The sago grains are the larger. 

5. Contour faceted maize, oats, and rice. The rice 
granules are the smallest, the maize the largest, and they 
have a stellate hilum. 

The polariscope gives valuable aid in differentiation. 

CARBOHYDRATES. 

Carbohydrates are compounds of carbon, hydrogen, and 
oxygen, the two latter being present in the same proportion 
in. which they combine to form water. The class is a large 
one, and its components are widely distributed in Nature. 
The carbohydrates may be arranged into three groups, viz. : 

1. Monosaccharids or Glucoses, including dextrose (or 
grape sugar), laevulose (or fruit sugar), and galactose. 

2. Disaccharids or Sugars, including saccharose (sucrose 
or cane sugar), lactose (or milk sugar), and maltose (or malt 
sugar). 

3. Polysaccharids or Starches, including starch, dex- 
trin, gum and cellulose, inulin, and glycogen. 

From allied groups certain substances used in bac- 
teriology are derived, and are enumerated here for the 



FOODS 103 

sake of completeness. These are raffinose or melitose 
(tri-saccharid), arabinose (pentose), and mannite, dulcite, 
and sorbite (hexahydric alcohols, hence better called 
mannitol, dulcitol, and sorbitol). 

The carbohydrates are distinguished from one another 
not only by their chemical constitution but by their relative 
sweetness, their source, their power of crystallization, 
their oxidation products, their power of reducing Fehling's 
solution, their action on polarized light, their reaction to 
the yeast and other ferments, and other tests. 

Commercially, sugar is obtained from the sugar cane 
(West Indies), beetroot (Western Europe), the maple tree 
(Canada and U.S.A.), various palm trees, such as date palm 
(India), sago palm (Ceylon), Palmyra palm (South America 
and Australia), a grass plant called sorghum (U.S.A.), and 
maize or Indian corn (Mexico). These plants all yield 
the Sugar known under the various names of sucrose, 
saccharose, cane sugar, beet sugar, etc. Sugar is soluble in 
i part of its weight of water at 15 C., in part in cold 
water, and in all proportions in boiling water. It dissolves 
with difficulty in alcohol. Its sp. gr. is 1-606. Its aqueous 
solution is dextro-rotatory, its specific rotatory power at 
20 C. for sodium light being A,, = + 66-5. It melts at 
1 60 C., and on cooling forms an amorphous glassy mass 
known as " barley-sugar," which in time loses its trans- 
parency and becomes crystalline. At 190 to 200 C. it 
changes to a brown non-crystallizable mass called caramel, 
which is used for colouring liquids. It does not reduce 
Fehling's solution nor ferment with yeast. When boiled 
with dilute acids it is decomposed into dextrose and 
laevulose, both of which reduce Fehling and ferment with 
yeast, but rotate the plane of polarized light in opposite 
directions. The laevulose has the greater rotating power, 
with the result that the solution has now a laevo-rotatory 
action, and is hence called " Invert Sugar." Cane sugar 
forms compounds with metals, metallic oxides, and salts, 
and these are named saccharates or sucrates, such as sodium 
sucrate, chloride of sodium sucrate, and lime sucrate. 
Cane sugar crystallizes in large monoclinic prisms. Boiled 
with nitric acid it oxidizes to oxalic and saccharic acids 
and inactive tartaric acid. 



104 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

Glucose and Lcevulose are found in equal proportions in 
all sweet fruits. It is likely that cane sugar first forms in 
the plants, and that a ferment at once breaks it up into 
grape sugar and fruit sugar, the mixture forming invert 
sugar. The saccharine substance which bees collect and 
form into honey is a mixture of these two sugars, forming 
" invert sugar," and hence pure honey is laevo-rotatory. 

Glucose, or dextrose, or grape sugar, or blood sugar, 
reduces Fehling's solution, ferments with .yeast, is dextro- 
rotatory (+ 52-7), and forms six-sided crystals. 

Lcevulose, or fructose, or fruit sugar, closely resembles 
glucose, but rotates polarized light to the left ( 95-5). 

Lactose, or sugar of milk, occurs in the milk of mammals. 
It crystallizes with one molecule of water in rhombic 
prisms, has a faintly sweet taste, is sparingly soluble in 
water (i in 6 of cold and I in 2-5 of hot) and is insoluble in 
alcohol. It reduces Fehling's solution, ferments readily 
with lactic ferment, but not with yeast (or very slowly). 
With dilute acids it yields galactose and dextrose. Lactose 
is dextro-rotatory (-f 52-7) for A (i . 

Galactose is got from lactose by heating with dilute 
sulphuric acid. It reduces Fehling, ferments with yeast, 
and is dextro-rotatory (-f 83-3 for A,). 

Maltose is a variety of sugar formed together with 
dextrin by the action of malt diastase upon starch. It 
can also be produced by the action of dilute sulphuric acid 
on starch. It ferments with yeast, reduces Fehling, is 
soluble in alcohol, is dextro-rotatory, and crystallizes in 
white needles + i molecule H 2 O. In the sugaring of 
starch by diastase at 60 C, two-thirds maltose and one- 
third of dextrin are produced thus : 

36 6 H j O 5 -f- H 2 O = C x 2 H 2 2 O ! ! + C 6 H j O 5 
Starch Maltose Dextrin 

Starch, or amylum, is found in the cells of many plants 
in the form of granules of vajying size (0-002 m.m. to 
0-185 mm.). These are insoluble in cold water and in 
alcohol. When heated with water the granules swell up 
at 50 C., burst, partially dissolve, and form starch paste, 
which turns the plane of polarization to the right. The 
soluble portion is called granulose ; the insoluble, starch 



FOODS 105 



cellulose. Alcohol precipitates a white powder (soluble 
starch) from the aqueous solution. The blue coloration 
produced by iodine is characteristic of starch. Heat 
discharges the coloration, but it reappears on cooling. 
By dilute acids, starch is converted into dextrin, maltose, 
and dextrose ; by diastase, into maltose and dextrin, as 
shown above ; and by the saliva, into dextrin and maltose. 

Dextrin is really a name which denotes several isomeric 
substances usually found in mixture and resembling each 
other very closely. They form gummy amorphous masses 
whose aqueous solutions are dextro-rotatory, hence the 
name dextrin. They do not reduce Fehling's solution 
and are not directly fermented by yeast, but in the presence 
of diastase, the dextrin is changed to dextrose and then 
fermented. They give a red colour with iodine, and are 
much used as substitutes for natural gums. 

Inulin is a polysaccharid found in the roots of dahlia, in 
chicory, and in many compositae. It is a white powder, 
soluble in boiling water to a clear solution. It gives a 
yellow colour with iodine. When boiled with water it is 
completely changed to fruit sugar (laevulose). 

Glycogen occurs in the liver of mammals. It is a mealy 
powder, soluble in hot H 2 O, gives a reddish-brown colour 
with iodine ; ferments change it to maltose, and dilute acids 
to dextrose. It is precipitated from solution by alcohol. 

Raffinose, or Melitose, is a trisaccharid found in Australian 
manna, in the flour of cotton seeds, in small amounts in 
sugar beets, and is crystallized from the molasses. It is 
very soluble, is dextro-rotatory, is easily fermented with 
yeast, but does not reduce Fehling's solution. 

Arabinose was formerly thought to be a glucose, but is 
really a pentose ; that is, contains but five carbon atoms. 
It is made from gum arabic by boiling with dilute sulphuric 
acid. It crystallizes in prisms, is slightly soluble, is dextro- 
rotatory, reduces Fehling's solution, but does not ferment 
with yeast. Boiling mineral acids convert it into furfurol. 

Mannite, or Mannitol, exists in three states, namely, dex- 
tro, laevo, and inactive. It has a sweet taste and is found in 
" manna," the dried sap of the manna ash (Fraxinus ornus). 
It is also made (with difficulty) by the action of nascent 
hydrogen on glucose. It oxidizes to saccharic acid. 



106 



PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 



Dulcite is another of the hexahydric alcohols, and is found 
in a manna from Madagascar. It is made artificially from 
lactose or galactose by treating them with nascent 
hydrogen. It oxidizes to mucic acid. 

Sorbite occurs in mountain-ash berries. With one 
molecule of water it forms small crystals which dissolve 
readily in water. 

Asparagine is the monamide of aspartic or amidosuccinic 
acid. It occurs in many plants (asparagus, beetroot, peas, 
beans, etc.). It may be crystallized from the pressed 
juice in rhombic prisms + iH 2 O. It ferments in the 
presence of albuminoids to ammonium succinate. There 
are laevo and dextro varieties. 

Inosile (muscle-sugar) is a crystallizable substance, with 
the same empirical formula as glucose, but it is not a 
carbohydrate but a hexahydric phenol of the benzene 
series. It is also found in unripe peas and beans.

Adonite, C 6 H 7 (OH), is a pentite (from Adonis vernalis). 

Salicin (C 13 H ]8 O 7 ) and Coniferin (C 16 H 22 O 8 -2H 2 O) are 
glucosides. 

Analysis of Cane Sugar. Moisture, 0-5 per cent in 
refined sugar, to 6 per cent in raw sugar. Ash, from a 



FOODS 107 

trace to 2 per cent. Glucose, not more than o-i per cent in 
refined, or 2 per cent in raw. Saccharose or sucrose, 93 per 
cent upwards. Other organic matter. Mineral matter. 
Colouring matter. Sugar mite (Acarus sacchari). 

Moisture. Dry 5 grm. in air-oven at 105 C. to a 
constant weight (about two hours). 

Ash. Treat residue with pure sulphuric acid and ignite 
to whiteness (takes twenty minutes). Nine-tenths of the 
sulphated ash are taken as the true ash. The ash of sugar 
consists of salts of potash and soda, lime, alumina, and silica. 

Glucose. Estimate by Fehling's solution, volumetrically 
or gravimetrically. 

Saccharose, or Sucrose, is estimated either (i) directly, by 
the polarimeter (saccharimeter), or (2) after " inversion," 
with Fehling's solution. 

i. Polarization is employed in all commercial transactions, 
and for the assessment of duty by the Customs authorities. 
It depends on the optical property of some bodies to 
rotate the plane of polarized light. The specific rotatory 
power of an optically active substance is the amount of 
angular rotation (in degrees) of the ray of polarized light 
which is produced when a solution of the substance con- 
taining i grm. per c.c. is examined in a column i decimetre 
(100 m.m.) long. If a be the observed angle of rotation 
in the sample, p the weight of the substance per 100 c.c. 
of solution, I the length of the tube in decimetres, and d 
the sodium light, then the specific rotatory power (A) d is 
determined from the formula 

... a 100 X a 100 X a 

(A}d = =: p = ~ 



To determine (A) d for pure cane sugar, dissolve 10 grm. 
in water and make up to 100 c.c. Put some of the solu- 
tion in a polarimeter tube, examine, and substitute in 
formula. Now examine sample similarly and compare 
results. The ratio of these, multiplied by 100, gives the 
percentage of pure sugar. Or, in the formula, simply 
substitute already ascertained values for (A) d , 

+ 66-5 being taken for saccharose, 
+ 52-7 ,, dextrose, and 

95-5 ,, laevulose 



108 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

at a temperature of 20 C. Clarify dark-coloured solutions 
with basic lead acetate. If cloudy only, add 3 c.c. cream 
of alumina, mix well, add one drop of PbAc, shake, and 
filter. If yellow, repeat, adding more PbAc. If brown 
or black, add 2 c.c. of 10 per cent Na 2 SO 3 , then PbAc 
solution till no further precipitate. 

2. Estimation by Fehling's Solution. The sugar must 
first be inverted by boiling with a dilute acid and 
then estimated either volumetrically or gravimetrically. 
(a) Volumetrically. Take I grm. of sample, dissolve in 
50 c.c. aq. dest., add 5 c.c. concentrated HC1, and heat to 
70 C. for 10 to 20 minutes to invert 

C j 2 H 2 2 O ! j + H 2 O = C 6 H x 2 O 6 -f- C 6 H ! 2 O 6 
Saccharose Dextrose Laevulose 

Cool, and neutralize with NaOH, make up to 100 c.c. 
(i.e., i per cent), and put into a burette. Take 10 c.c. of 
Fehling's solution in a flask or porcelain dish, add 40 c.c. 
of water, and bring to the boil. Run in the dilute sugar 
solution carefully until all the copper is reduced, keeping 
the liquid at the boiling-point all the time. The end point 
is the chief difficulty in this method. Filtration is helpful, 
but an indicator is commonly used. Allow to settle, 
remove a drop of the supernatant fluid, and test on a 
white tile with potassium ferrocyanide until a brown 
precipitate is no longer given on acidifying with acetic acid. 
Or, using Harrison's indicator, take several drops of a 
freshly-made mixture (of 0-05 grm. of starch boiled with 
water, 10 grm. of KI added, and the bulk made up to 
100 c.c.) on a white tile, and from time to time a drop of 
the hot liquid (precipitate and all) is removed and placed 
on a spot and a drop of acetic acid is superimposed. A 
blue colour develops until all the copper is reduced. 10 c.c. 
of Fehling's solution = 0-0475 grm. inverted cane sugar 
and 0-0500 grm. dextrose, laevulose, or invert sugar, and 
0-0678 grm. lactose and 0-0807 S rm - maltose, (b) Gravi- 
metrically. Proceed as above until the I per cent inverted 
saccharine solution is obtained. Thereafter take 20 c.c. 
to 50 c.c. of Fehling and boil. Add a measured quantity 
of the i per cent solution (but always less than will com- 
pletely precipitate the Fehling solution) and continue the 



FOODS 109 

boiling for two to six minutes, when there should be a red 
precipitate and the liquid should still be blue. Now filter 
rapidly, washing the precipitate at first by decantation 
and then on the filter-paper, until the washings contain 
no copper. Dry, ignite, and weigh as CuO (black copper 
oxide). Weight X 0-4308 gives cane sugar, and 
X 0-4535 gives glucose. The CuO is hygroscopic ; therefore, 
for accuracy, at least two ignitions and two weighings are 
necessary. Also prolonged ignition is needed to oxidize all 
the Cu 2 O (the filter-paper having a reducing action). 

Insoluble Mineral Matter. Dissolve a considerable 
amount in water, filter on to weighed paper, dry, and weigh. 

Colouring Matter. Extract with alcohol and steep a 
piece of wool mordanted with aluminium acetate. Aniline 
dyes are dissolved and stain the wool. The natural 
colour is not so removed. Ultramarine is used to 
" whiten " sugar, as also is methyl-violet, both correcting 
the slight yellow tint natural to sugar. To fix the natural 
yellow tint, chloride of tin was formerly used, but not now. 
Demerara sugar is made by adding sulphuric acid to the 
massecuite (the finished mass of sugar crystals and syrup 
formed by concentrating syrup in a vacuum pan) so as to 
slightly char the sugar grains. About 3 gallons of pure 
sulphuric acid, diluted with 1-5 gallons of water, are used 
for 5 tons of sugar. This gives the bright yellow colour 
so much admired. Animal charcoal, sulphurous acid, and 
peroxide of hydrogen are also used in various processes. 

The sample is dyed if, when treated with a few drops of 
concentrated HC1, a pink colour forms. 

Sugar Mite, or Acarus sacchari, by microscope. 

Sugar of Milk or Lactose is made on the large scale from 
whey or skimmed milk. 

Glucose, or Starch Sugar, is made on the large scale from 
the starch of maize, potato, rice, and sago, by treating 
with weak (pure) mineral acid, aided by boiling under 
increased pressure until some of the liquid added to alcohol 
gives no precipitate of dextrin or no iodine reaction. The 
acid is then carefully neutralized and the resulting glucose 
solution refined. Poisoning has arisen from the use of 
impure sulphuric acid in the process (arsenic in beer).

GOLDEN SYRUP : HONEY. 

Golden Syrup. When the syrups no longer yield 
sugar they are made into treacle. Golden syrup or 
invert-sugar syrup is also largely made from the sap of the 
maple in Canada and U.S.A., thus saving the time and 
fuel required to extract the sugar. The various drainings 
from the crystallized sugar are called molasses. This passed 
through a charcoal filter becomes bright and clear, and, 
when concentrated to the required viscosity, forms golden 
syrup. In the case of maple sap, it is first boiled, and 
skimmed and strained while still hot, and the evaporation 
is continued to a density of 1325, or equal to n Ib. of sugar 
to the gallon. It is then poured while hot into perfectly 
clean pans or tins, which are then sealed to keep out the 
air. Syrups of this strength will not granulate under 
ordinary conditions. The steps of the process can be 
gauged by a thermometer, the thin sap boiling at about 
213 F., and a syrup of the desired strength at 235 to 
240 F., giving a polarimeter figure of over 80, for which 
a bounty was at one time paid by the state of Vermont, 
U.S.A. 

Molasses of inferior grades is used, when inverted, for 
the manufacture of alcohol, for feeding cattle, or for fuel. 
Sorghum juice is also a source of syrup. 

The chief adulterant of golden syrup is glucose, which is 
added to thicken it to improve the appearance, and where 
the syrup contains some crystallizable sugar, to prevent its 
deposition. The presence of glucose is determined by the 
polarimeter, the specific rotatory power of genuine golden 
syrup being taken as + 16, and of glucose syrup as + 110, 
then if a d be the observed rotation, the percentage of 
glucose will be 

ioo(a a -i6) -f- (110-16) 

The reducing power of golden syrup is due to glucose and 
invert sugars present. A second estimation, after inverting 
any cane sugar present, shows how much, if any, is present. 
A third, after inverting for three hours, shows, if giving a 
higher result than the second, the presence of maltose and 
dextrin, which would confirm the presence of glucose or 
starch-derived sugar. 



FOODS 111 

Honey consists of the saccharine substance collected by 
bees from the nectaries of flowers, and deposited in the cells 
of the honeycomb. Honeydew is a secretion of the leaves 
of various trees and plants, and is also gathered by bees. 

Honey contains dextrose and laevulose, and hence, like 
invert sugar, is laevo-rotatory from 4 to 15, and the 
reading is not altered to any extent by inversion, showing 
the absence of cane sugar. If the reading is + , it indicates 
the presence of glucose or cane sugar, and if after inversion 
it is still -(-, then the substance is glucose. If the reading 
is -f- and very high (above 100), the presence of glucose 
is almost certain, and in this case if no cane sugar is 
present at the same time, inversion will not change the 
reading. Cane sugar is stated to be present in natural 
honey at times, up to 8 to 10 per cent, and so a reading 
of + 2 may be passed. 

Honey is largely adulterated with glucose, starch paste, 
malt extract, and cane sugar, and imitated by adding a piece 
of genuine honeycomb to a jar of glucose syrup. On micro- 
scopical examination, genuine honey will always show the 
presence of pollen grains, which would generally be absent 
from a filtered honey. (Mel depuratum B.P. is the honey 
of commerce melted in a water-bath, and strained while hot 
through flannel previously moistened with warm water.) 

Beeswax melts at about 64 C. (147 F.) and is carbonized 
by strong sulphuric acid on boiling ; paraffin wax melts at 
54 to 57 C. (130 to 135 F.) and is not carbonized on 
boiling with strong sulphuric acid. 

ANALYSIS. Water varies from 15 per cent to 25 per cent, 
and is estimated by dissolving 5 grm. in water, making 
up to 100 c.c., and drying 10 c.c. mixed with 10 grm. of 
sand at 96 C. until weight constant. Ash. Ignite 2 to 5 
grm. at a low heat. Varies from o-i to 0-3 per cent, 
and is alkaline. If more, it suggests glucose ; test for 
CaSO 4 , and neutrality. 

Polariscope Reading. Dissol've the " normal weight " of 
honey in water and make up to 100 c.c., filter through a 
small quantity of bone charcoal to clarify, and examine in 
saccharimeter. 

Glucose. Syrup ; sticky precipitate with one part of 
water and ten of methyl alcohol.

MUSTARD. 

Mustard is the seed of Sinapis alba and S. nigra. It is 
commonly sold as a powder. Pure mustard contains 14 
per cent of carbohydrates, 0-66 per cent of volatile oil, 35 
per cent of fixed oil. The chief adulterations are : the 
addition of starch, bringing up- the percentage of carbo- 
hydrates to 67 per cent ; the abstraction of oil, reducing 
it to as low as 7 per cent ; the addition of turmeric to 
colour, and cayenne pepper to make the taste sharper. 
Examine with microscope for hexagonal cells in white 
mustard. 

PEPPER. 

Black pepper is derived from Piper nigrum. White 
pepper is made from the inside of the berry. 

Moisture, 9 to n per cent ; ash, 2 to 5 per cent ; ash 
insoluble in HC1, under i per cent for white, under 2 per 
cent for black pepper ; fibre, 4 to 6 per cent in white, 8 to 
ii per cent in black ; carbohydrate, 65 per cent in white, 
50 per cent in black ; piperin and fixed oil, 8-2 per cent 
in white, 7-8 per cent in black. Adulterations : linseed, 
mustard husks, wheat and pea flour, rape cake, ground 
rice, ground olive stones (poivrette), sweepings. 

GINGER. 

Ash, under 3-9 per cent ; soluble ash, over 1-7 per cent ; 
cold water extract, over 8-7 per cent. 

PEAS. 

Test peas, especially when tinned or bottled, for copper, 
used in " greening " them. 

Qualitative Test. Acidify with HC1 and put a piece of 
bright steel in the liquid in which the peas are immersed. 
Stand all night. Deposit of copper, of a coppery colour. 

Quantitative Test. Ash 20 grm. of peas, boil ash with 
dilute sulphuric acid. Filter, and make up filtrate to 
50 c.c. Test amount of copper colorimetrically, or 
gravimetrically.

CHAPTER VI. 

BEVERAGES. 
COFFEE. 

THE seed or berry of the plant Coffea arabica. Each 
coffee bean contains two seeds. These are removed, 
roasted, and ground, producing coffee. The chief con- 
stituent is caffeine, identical with theine, or trimethyl- 
xanthin C 5 H(CH 3 ) 3 N 4 2 , and on the average 1-2 per 
cent is present. 

The chief adulterant is chicory, or the wild endive 
(Cichorium intybus], but this can be legally used as a 
diluent for coffee if the article is sold as a mixture. Chicory 
is the root of the plant, dried, and powdered. It contains 
no caffeine, much less fat than coffee, and much more sugar. 

Other adulterants which have been used are : dandelion 
root, mangel-wurzel, turnips, bean, pea, rye, and wheat 
flours, caramelized condemned sea-biscuit. The berries 
themselves are sometimes spurious, being moulded from a 
composition of chicory and other substances. Chicory 
itself is sometimes adulterated with some of these substances 
and occasionally with roasted beetroot. 

ANALYSIS. 

Moisture. Dry 5 grm. to a constant weight at 100 C. 
Should not exceed 6 per cent (chicory 10 per cent). 

Total Ash. Ignite 5 grams, until a nearly white ash is 
obtained. From 3-5 to 5 per cent. Chicory ash is reddish 
from the presence of iron, and is about 5 per cent. Four- 
fifths of coffee ash is soluble in water ; one-third of chicory 
ash. 

Caffeine is extracted by successive boilings with water, 
the albuminous matter precipitated by acetate of lead, 
filter, concentrate the filtrate to small bulk, and extract 
four or five times with chloroform. On evaporating the 
chloroform, pure caffeine is left. Should be i-i per cent 
to 1-3 per cent (chicory none). 

8 



114 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

Fat. Soak in petroleum ether for several hours, pipette 
off 20 c.c. of ether and evaporate off ether in a tarred vessel. 
Averages n to 14 per cent (chicory i to 2 per cent). 

Sugar. Extract with hot water, invert, and estimate. 
Under I per cent (chicory 10 to 18 per cent). 

Starch. Make a 10 per cent decoction, boil with animal 
charcoal to decolorize (or acid permanganate), cool, and 
test with iodine solution. Pure coffee contains almost no 
starch, and the presence would indicate adulteration with 
breadcrumbs, etc. Mounting in iodine (i in 1000) brings 
out the concentric rings. 

Detection of Chicory. 

Qualitative. Throw a pinch on to the surface of a glass 
of water. Pure coffee remains floating on the top for 
some minutes at least, whilst chicory sinks almost instantly, 
and colours the liquid. The fragments which fall to the 
bottom are taken out separately and examined by the 
fingers (coffee is hard, chicory is soft). They are then 
examined microscopically for the long testa cells of coffee 
berry and the ladder-shaped structures, and in chicory for 
the cells and dotted ducts. 

Quantitative. Take 10 grm. of sample in a boiling-flask, 
add 100 c.c. of water, bring to the boil, and continue for 
one half minute. Strain through muslin or a fine sieve, 
and then through a filter-paper. Cool to 15-5 C. (60 F.) 
and take specific gravity by bottle. Under these con- 
ditions pure coffee gives a decoction having a sp. gr. rarely 
exceeding 1009-5, and chicory about 1024 to 1025, or say 
1024-5. Thus a difference of 15 per 1000 represents the 
difference between 100 per cent coffee and 100 per cent 
chicory, and from these data the amount of adulteration 
can be calculated. Say that the sp. gr. of sample is 1014-5, 
that is a rise of 5 ; therefore, as 15 : 5 : : 100 : 33-3 per cent 
of chicory, and a fall of 10 from the sp. gr. of chicory, and 
therefore as 15 : 10 : : 100 : 66-6 per cent of coffee. 

A second method is to take 10 grm., add 100 c.c., bring 
to the boil, filter, boil dregs with another 150 c.c. for five 
minutes, allow to settle, decant off clear liquid, mix with 
previous filtrate, make up to 250 c.c. with aq. dest., mix 
thoroughly, pipette off 50 c.c., evaporate to dryness in 
weighed capsule over water-bath, weigh, and calculate 



BEVERAGES 115 

as a percentage. Coffee gives a remarkably constant 
percentage of 24, and chicory a mean percentage of 70, or 
a standard difference of 46, so that percentage of coffee = 
100 (70 percentage of extract found) -f- 46. A third 
method is to calculate the percentage of soluble ash and 
then calculate adulteration on this basis. 

TEA. 

Tea is the prepared leaf of the shrub, Camellia thea, 
which grows in China, India, Ceylon, and Japan. It is 
nearly always blended to a standard quality and flavour 
by mixing two or more kinds of leaves. When the leaves 
are baked (to dry them) immediately after picking, green 
tea results ; but if first allowed to ferment and then baked, 
black tea is obtained. The chief constituents of tea are 
moisture, caffeine, tannin, albuminous matters, ethereal 
oil, gum, dextrin, fat, wax, chlorophyll, woody fibre, etc. 
Tea is now rarely adulterated, since it is examined by the 
Customs authorities, and samples found to be adulterated 
are not allowed to be imported. The usual adulterants 
were foreign leaves (sloe, willow, elder, hawthorn, beech, 
etc.), sweepings, tea dust, clay, mineral matter, ground 
olive stones, catechu, gum, starch, and exhausted tea- 
leaves. 

Moisture. Dry 5 grm. of sample to a constant weight. 
Varies from 4 to n per cent ; average 6 per cent. 

Total Ash. Ignite dried tea at lowest possible tempera- 
ture to get a grey, not a green ash. Varies from about 
5 per cent to 7 per cent, averaging about 6 per cent. 

Insoluble Ash. The total ash after weighing is washed 
on to a filter-paper, and thoroughly extracted with about 
400 c.c. of very hot water, the washings being carefully 
preserved. The filter-paper is then dried, ignited, and 
weighed, and the weight of filter-paper ash being deducted, 
the amount of insoluble ash is known. Varies from 2 per 
cent to 4 per cent, of which less than i per cent is 
insoluble in HC1. 

Soluble Ash. Deduct amount of insoluble ash from 
total ash, and result is soluble ash. Varies from 2-8 to 4 
per cent, but should be at least half the total ash. If the 



116 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

soluble is low, the inference is an admixture with exhausted 
leaves. 

Alkalinity of the Soluble Ash is determined by titrating the 
washings of the total ash (taking 50 c.c.) with N /io, HC1 or 
H 2 SO 4 , using methyl-orange as indicator and returning 
the answer in terms of K 2 O. Varies from 1-3 to 2 per 
cent, i c.c. N/io acid = 0-0047 grm. K 2 0. 

Extract. Dry some of the leaves at 100 C. ; then 
weigh out 2 grm. and exhaust thoroughly by boiling under 
a reflux condenser for one hour. Filter off water, and repeat 
with more water until no more colour is imparted to the 
water. Collect the exhausted leaves, dry, and weigh. The 
difference from original weight gives the amount of extract, 
which should be from 35 to 40 per cent of the dried tea. 

Caffeine. Extracted as indicated under " Coffee." 
Varies from 1-8 to 3-5 per cent ; average 2-6 per cent. 

Tannin. Treat 2 grm. as described under " Extract," 
but keep the nitrates and make up to a known bulk (i litre). 
Take an aliquot part (say 100 c.c.) in a beaker, add excess 
of 5 per cent copper-acetate solution, and boil. The 
precipitate contains all the tannin. Filter and wash 
precipitate until the washings are free of copper. Dry, 
ignite, weigh, and deduct filter ash. The weight of ash x 
1-305 = tannin. The ash is CuO. The amount of tannin 
varies from 13 to 18 per cent. 

Caffeine - Tannate. Experiments in the "Lancet" 
laboratory (Lancet, 1911, vol. i, page 46 ; and vol. ii, page 
1573) led to the conclusion " that an infusion of tea is a 
solution of caffeine-tannate in an alkaline medium." On 
neutralization (with HC1) the caffeine-tannate is gradually 
thrown out of solution, it being only slightly soluble in 
cold water but readily soluble in hot water. Caffeine- 
tannate is a compound of one part of caffeine with three 
parts of tannic acid. When these substances are present 
in these proportions in a tea infusion, they neutralize each 
other's effects by combination, and are precipitated by 
the gastric juice. Excess of either is detected by the 
palate as bitterness or astringency in the infusion. 

Aroma is mainly due to a volatile oil, which is present 
to the extent of 0-5 per cent. 



BEVERAGES 117 

Microscopic Characters are important. Soak leaves in 
hot water, when they are easily laid out flat on a slide, and 
examined. The tea leaf has a serrated margin (but not 
quite to the stalk), the primary veins run out from the 
midrib nearly to the margin and then loop : possesses 
stomata and long hairs on the under surface, and internally 
shows long branched cells, called " idioblasts." The apex 
of the leaf is described as notched or emarginate. Average 
size, i in. to 2 in. by | in. to i in.

Exhausted 4-4 % 07 % 0-2 % 

COCOA. 

Cocoa is the prepared seed of Theobroma cacao and allied 
trees, growing in the West Indies, Mexico, Brazil, etc. 
The seeds are contained in a pod packed in a pulpy 
substance. Each pod holds 25 to 30 seeds. The ripe pods 
are allowed to ferment, when the seeds are easily separated. 
These are then dried in the sun, or in ovens, roasted in iron 
cylinders, cracked by machinery, and the husks separated 
from the cocoa beans or " nibs." The nibs are then 
ground, but either some of the fat has to be removed or 
some diluent (as starch or sugar) added before they can 
be made into a powder. A further treatment is to add 
alkali, which may be potassium carbonate or the sodium 
or ammonium salt. The added alkali emulsifies the fat 
and saponifies any free fatty acid, so that on addition of 
hot water there is less tendency for the fatty globules to 
separate the so-called " soluble cocoa." Cocoa contains 
the following : moisture, fat, starch, theobromine, proteins, 
cellulose, and mineral matter (including phosphates). 

Moisture. Dry 2 grm. in water-oven. In raw cocoa, 
4-5 per cent ; commercial, 8 to 13 per cent. 

Fat is estimated by the Soxhlet process ; 51 per cent in 
raw cocoa and about 30 per cent in prepared. It is also 
known as cacao butter, or oil of theobroma of the B.P., 
and is used for suppositories. It is yellowish in colour, and 
contains stearin, olein, and theobromine. Melting point 



118 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

31 to 34 C. (Distinguish from coco-nut oil, from Cocos 
nucifera, a tropical palm. Melting point 20 to 26 C.) 

Ash. Ignite 5 grm. in a platinum dish at a low red heat. 
If red, examine for iron. Is about 3 per cent in raw cocoa 
(rock cocoa), and 5 per cent in commercial varieties. 
Contains about I per cent of phosphoric anhydride, but 
this varies. 

Soluble Ash is not determined from the ash but from the 
soluble extract. It should not fall below 2 per cent. 

Soluble Extract (cold water extract). Five grm. of the 
sample are rubbed up in a mortar with 250 c.c. of cold 
water until a smooth mixture results. Shake at intervals, 
and allow to stand over night. Filter 50 c.c. (= I gram, 
of sample) and evaporate to a constant weight (dryness). 
Should not exceed 18 per cent. Any material excess is 
probably due to added sugar. This residue is now ignited 
at a gentle heat, cooled, and weighed, and the result called 
the " soluble ash " (better, the ext. ash). 

Theobromine is allied to caffeine, being a dimethylxan- 
thin, and like it is not precipitated by potassic mercuric 
iodide, or by I in KI. Estimate by treating with petroleum 
ether ; remove latter on water-bath ; extract with alcohol ; 
evaporate alcohol ; add water, and clarify with PbAc ; 
remove lead with H 2 S, and extract with chloroform. 
Amount varies from 1-3 to 1-7 per cent. Theobromine 
contains 31-1 per cent of nitrogen. 

Proteins. Estimated approximately by Kjeldahl process. 
Deduct N due to theobromine and x by 6-25. Averages 
2-2 per cent except where proteins added (plasmon cocoa) . 

Starch. Cocoa contains about 10 per cent of natural 
starch. The granules are small and round and are easily 
distinguished from any likely to be added as an 
adulterant. 

Sugar is determined by extracting 10 grm. in a filter- 
paper cylinder in a Soxhlet to remove the fat. 
Dry and extract with alcohol, which dissolves the sugar 
and other matters. Remove latter as before, boil for ten 
minutes with 2 per cent HC1, neutralize, and estimate the 
invert sugar by Pavy's process. The residue contains the 
starch. Boil for six hours with 200 c.c. of 2 per cent 



BEVERAGES 119 

H 2 SO 4 . The new residue, treated with 2. per cent NaOH 
and then weak HC1, and filtered, gives "insoluble fibre." 
Adulterants. Potassium carbonate, ground cocoa-shells, 
red sanders wood, iron oxide, sugar, and starch. Micro- 
scopic examination detects most of these. 

Paraguay Tea, known as " mate," contains i per 
cent of theine. Used in South America. 

Guarana contains 5 per cent of theine or caffeine. Used 
for migraine. From seeds. 

Kola. From the seeds of a tree growing wild on the 
West Coast of Africa. It contains 2-42 per cent of caffeine, 
little fat (0-68 per cent), starch and sugar 36-5 per cent, and 
proteins 6-7 per cent. Spurious kola nuts containing no 
caffeine are much sold. 

Coca. From the leaves of Erythroxylon coca ; contains 
the alkaloid cocaine. The reputed sustaining powers of 
coca leaves are not marked in the case of Europeans, 
probably from their ordinary dietary being rich in 
stimulant extractives of the xanthin group. On the 
natives the effects are notable. 

LEMON JUICE AND LIME JUICE. 

Lemon Juice Is the expressed juice of the Citrus 
limonum, and is a slightly turbid, yellowish liquid, with a 
sharply acid taste. The British Pharmacopoeia standard 
is : specific gravity, 1030 to 1040 ; citric acid, 30 to 40 grains 
per fluid ounce ; and ash, not more than 3 per cent. The 
Board of Trade standard for lemon and lime juices is : 
sp. gr. (when de-alcoholized) 1030, and 30 grains per 
ounce of citric acid. As found in the Merchant Service, 
or in the Royal Navy, these juices have sugar added to 
them, and have I ounce of brandy added per 10 ounces of 
juice, or are pasteurized at 145 F., or are boiled. The 
alcoholic juice keeps better, and freezes at a lower tem- 
perature. The latter point is of importance in Arctic 
and Antarctic expeditions. Good juice keeps about three 
years ; bad juice becomes turbid, stringy, and muci- 
laginous ; glucose and CO 2 being formed from the decom- 
position of the citric and malic acids present. One ounce 



120 



PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 



of lemon juice per head per day must be issued when a 
vessel has been ten days at sea, except when in harbour 
if fresh vegetables can be had. 

Lime Juice Is the expressed juice of the Citrus 
limetta. Like lemon juice, it contains free citric acid, 
traces of other organic acids, citrates, sugar, and albuminous 
and mucilaginous bodies. The average composition of 
these juices is :

According to the above standards, the percentage of citric 
acid should be 6-6 to 8-8 per cent. Few juices reach the 
higher figure. The important points in the analysis are : 
specific gravity, total solids, free citric acid, combined 
acidity, ash, free mineral acid, tartaric acid, alcohol, 
sulphites, and salicylic acid. 

Specific Gravity. Lime juice is usually about 1035 to 
1037 (= 32 grains per oz.). 

Total Solids. Evaporate 10 c.c. over water-bath, and 
dry in oven to constant weight. Vary from 5 to 9 per cent. 

Ash. Ignite the residue. For lemon juice, should not 
exceed 3 per cent, and be neutral. 

Free Citric Acid. Titrate 20 c.c. with N/i or N/2 
NaOH, using phenolphthalein as indicator, i c.c. N/i 
NaOH = 0-07 grm. crystallized citric acid, H S C 6 H.O 7 .H 7 O. 
The percentage x 4-375 = grains per fl. oz. Varies from 
5 to 9 per cent. 

Combined Acids. The neutralized juice from the above 
process is evaporated to dryness on the water-bath, and 
the residue ignited at a low temperature. The citrates 
are changed to carbonates. Cool, and extract mass with 
hot water, add sufficient N/i sulphuric acid to make acid 
(noting the quantity), boil to get rid of CO 2 and then 
filter. Now titrate with N/i NaOH, using methyl-orange 
as indicator, to estimate amount of N /i sulphuric, added 
in excess. This amount deducted from the total amount 



BEVERAGES 121 

of sulphuric used, gives the amount of N/i sulphuric 
required to decompose the carbonates formed from the 
citrates by ignition. These citrates are partly present as 
such, and partly from neutralization of the free acid by 
soda, some of which is not citric. The result, therefore, 
gives the total organic acid, free and combined, in the 
sample, calculated as citric acid. The combined acid 
expressed as citric acid, is got by subtracting from the 
total acid the amount of free acid in sample, i c.c. N/i 
sulphuric acid = 0-07 grin, crystallized citric acid. 

Free Mineral Acid. Place several drops of methylene- 
violet solution on a white slab. Add a drop of juice ; 
if free mineral acid is present, a greenish coloration is 
.got. With logwood solution dried on a slab, a drop of 
juice, if it contains free mineral acid, gives a red coloration. 

Sulphites. Add Zn and HC1, and heat ; if sulphites 
.are present, H 2 S is given off, and will blacken lead acetate 
paper (moist). Quantitatively : take 50 c.c. of sample 
and add 25 c.c. N/i KOH, and shake at intervals for 
fifteen minutes. Add 10 c.c. 25 per cent sulphuric and 
starch solution, and titrate rapidly with N/io iodine 
until a permanent blue colour, lasting two minutes, is 
produced, i c.c. N/io iodine = 0-0032 grm. SO 2 . When 
the sulphurous acid is present in the free state, a known 
excess of N/io iodine may be added to a measured or 
weighed quantity of the sample, the whole allowed to 
stand, with occasional shaking, for one hour, and then 
titrated with standard thiosulphate solution to find 
excess of iodine. Another process for sulphites, is to take 
a quantity of the sample in a flask, add a large excess of 
water, and then HC1. Distil over the liberated SO 2 into 
a known quantity of N/io iodine, and find excess of 
iodine solution used by titration with standard thiosulphate. 
The difference is the amount of N /io iodine used in oxidiz- 
ing sulphurous acid to sulphuric. 

H 2 SO 3 + I 2 + H 2 O = H 2 SO 4 + 2HI. 

Alcohol. By distillation (see under "Beer," page 128).

water. . Test with ferric chloride ; a violet coloration, not 
discharged by acetic acid, is positive. 

Tartaric Acid. Neutralize with NaOH, add calcium 
chloride, and shake well : if tartaric is present, a white 
crystalline precipitate of calcium tartrate falls. To estimate, 
take 25 c.c., add potassium acetate and alcohol, stand for 
some hours, stirring occasionally, filter, washing with 
saturated solution of potassium acid tartrate, dry, and 
weigh as cream of tartar, KHC<H 4 O 6 , or KHT. 

Poisonous Metals Test for as on page 124. 

VINEGAR. 

Vinegar may be denned as the " product of the alco- 
holic and acetous fermentation of a vegetable infusion." 
This definition includes all brewed vinegars, but excludes 
wood vinegar, made by diluting acetic acid derived from 
the destructive distillation of wood. The vinegars in 
common use are : malt, cider, wine, white or distilled, and 
wood vinegars, and vinegar from starch, glucose, and 
molasses. The essential constituent is acetic acid, which 
should not be under 3 per cent in a good vinegar. The 
other constituents, and their amount, vary with the mode 
of production : malt vinegar yielding the most, and distilled 
vinegar the least, extract or total solids. 

Malt Vinegar is made from malted barley, which is first 
fermented to produce alcohol (by yeast), and the resulting 
liquid poured over piles of birch twigs, and exposed to the 
air. The vinegar plant (Mycoderma aceti) grows on the 
twigs, and converts the alcohol to vinegar, with formation 
of small quantities of acetic ether, aldehyde, and other 
bodies, which give such vinegar its pleasant odour. 
Genuine malt vinegar has the following composition : 
specific gravity at 15-5 F. 1019 ; acetic acid, 5-50 per cent ; 
extract, 2-50 per cent ; ash, 0-50 per cent ; N, 0-08 per 
cent ; P 2 O 5 , 0-08 per cent. It is dextro-rotatory. 

Wine Vinegars are made from grape juice and inferior 
new wine, and vary in colour from straw to red (malt 
vinegar is brown). They usually contain I per cent of 
alcohol, i per cent of extract, 5 to 6 per cent of acetic acid, 
not less than 0-25 per cent of ash, and small quantities of 



BEVERAGES 123 

tartaric acid and KHT. The specific gravity varies from 
1015 to 1022. 

Cider Vinegar, from apple juice, is much used in America. 
It contains 5 per cent of acetic acid, some malic acid, is 
laevo-rotatory, and contains no aldehyde. 

White Vinegar is made by distilling malt vinegar. 

Wood Vinegar, by destructive distillation of wood. 

Vinegars from starch and glucose run the same danger 
of arsenical contamination as beer made from these 
substances. They are dextro-rotatory. 

Vinegar was formerly excisable, and to preserve it, 
sulphuric acid was allowed .to be added, not exceeding 
i/ioooth part by weight (duty abolished in 1844). 

Sodium carbonate or ammonia gives a purplish precipitate 
in wine vinegar, but not in malt vinegar. 

ADULTERATIONS AND CONTAMINATIONS. Water, mineral 
acids, pyro-ligneous acid, metals, colouring agents, preser- 
vatives, gypsum, capsicum, vinegar eels. Vinegar is at 
times pasteurized at 145 F. 

ANALYSIS. Specific gravity, total solids, ash, acetic 
acid, free mineral acid, poisonous metals, nitrogen, and 
phosphoric acid. Microscope for eels (Anguillula oxyphila). 

Specific Gravity. By sp.-gr. bottle or Westphal balance, 
1015 to 1022. The sp. gr. of an artificial vinegar will vary 
with the amount of acetic acid, caramel, and malt vinegar 
it contains. Thus the acidum aceticum dilutum of the 
B.P., which contains 4-27 per cent (by weight) of acetic 
acid, and should yield no residue on evaporation, has a 
sp. gr. of 1006. The sp. gr. of these vinegars will therefore 
average above this figure. 

Total Solids. Evaporate 25 c.c. to constant weight in 
a tared dish. Varies with the vinegar : malt, 2-50 per cent ; 
cider, 2 per cent ; wine, i per cent ; white, 0-2 or less. 

Ash. Ignite at a low temperature. Should be alkaline 
if free from mineral acid. Varies from 0-5 to O'2 per cent 
in malt and cider, to 0-03 per cent or less in distilled. 

Alkalinity of Ash. Extract ash with hot water, titrate 
with N/io acid, using methyl-orange as an indicator, 
i c.c. N/io acid = 0-0047 g rm - K 2 O. About 0-026 per 
cent in malt, and 0-14 per cent in cider vinegar. 



124 

Acetic Acid. Take 10 c.c. of sample in a porcelain dish. 
If dark coloured, dilute well. Titrate with N/2 NaOH, 
using phenolphthalein as indicator: i c.c. N/i NaOH = 
0-06 grm. glacial acetic acid. Should not be less than 
3 per cent. 

Malic Acid in genuine cider vinegar. Gives a fairly 
copious precipitate with lead subacetate solution. 

Free Sulphuric Acid. A few drops of sample are taken 
on a white slab. Place near a drop of methyl-violet and 
bring into contact with a glass rod. If only a trace of free 
acid is present, the violet changes to blue ; but if more than 
i part per 1000 be present a green colour develops. Or 
test with logwood, as described under " Lime Juice." Or 
add five drops of methyl-violet solution to 5 c.c. of sample, 
and compare with control. Dilute sample if dark coloured. 

Nitrogen. Evaporate 25 c.c. to dryness, and proceed as 
usual (none in wood or distilled vinegars). Less than o-i 
per cent as a rule. 

Phosphoric Acid is estimated by Stock's method. This 
consists in treating the ash with nitric acid, adding 
ammonia, then more nitric, till the precipitate formed 
dissolves; then more ammonia, until it returns slightly. 
Some fuming nitric is then added, the solution warmed to 
70 C., and ammonium molybdate solution added, when a 
yellow precipitate forms and is collected and weighed. 
Weight X 0-0373 = P 2 O 5 . (None in distilled vinegars.) 

Poisonous Metals. Dissolve ash in boiling distilled 
water, or this failing, in boiling dilute HC1, or if necessary, 
in HC1 (2 parts) + HNO 3 (i part), and then test by usual 
analytical table. HC1 precipitates Ag, Hg', Pb ; H 2 S 
precipitates Pb, Hg", Cu, Bi, Cd, As, Sb, Sn, Au, Pt ; AmCl 
and AmOH precipitate Al, Cr, Fe ; Am 2 S precipitates Zn 
Mn, Ni, Co ; Am 2 CO 3 precipitates Ba, Sr, Ca ; AmHPO 4 
precipitates Mg. 

Copper, if present in the vinegar of pickles, may be 
detected by inserting the bright blade of a steel knife. 

Arsenic may be derived from arsenical malt, caramel, 
or glucose. Use Reinsch's test (see under " Beer," page 129). 

Copper, lead, and tin may all be derived in the process of 
manufacture (cider vinegar) or from storage in metallic 
or metallic-covered vessels. 



BEVERAGES 125 

Potassium ferrocyanide is sometimes used to clarify vine- 
gars, and is said to be decomposed, leaving in solution an 
unstable compound of prussic acid with the organic matter. 

Estimation of the Free Sulphuric Acid. Take 50 c.c. of 
sample, add 25 c.c. N/io NaOH. Evaporate whole to 
dryness, and ignite. To ash add 25 c.c. N/io, HC1 or 
H 2 S0 4 , 25 c.c. aq. dest., and boil to expel CO 2 . Filter, 
wash paper with hot water, and titrate whole nitrate with 
N/io, NaOH, and phenolphthalein. The number of c.c. 
of soda used x 0-0049 = ^ ree sulphuric acid in 50 c.c. of 
sample. 

Barium chloride cannot be used to test for the free acid, 
as vinegar is often made from hard waters containing 
sulphates, which would also precipitate the barium. 

Microscope for vinegar eels, (i to 2*5 mm. in length.) 

Preservatives. Test as elsewhere. 

Vinegar, in doses of from a half to one ounce daily, is an 
anti-scorbutic, but is inferior to lime and lemon-juices. 

BEER. 

Beer is usually denned as "a fermented infusion of 
malt, flavoured with hops," but this definition must be 
extended to include beers brewed from saccharine fluids 
other than malt infusion, and flavoured with other bitters 
than hops. The malt substitutes are such as malted 
Indian corn, and starches chemically converted into 
sugars (rice, potato, and other starches) by the use of 
sulphuric acid. The latter may contain arsenic derived 
from the acid used, and so contaminate the beer. This 
happened in South Lancashire in 1900. The hop 
substitutes are used only in a few breweries, of which a 
list is published by the Inland Revenue authorities. They 
are such bitters as quassia, gentian, calumba, chiretta. 
Noxious bitters have at times been used, as nux vomica, 
picrotoxin, and picric acid. 

Malt Beer is thus made: Barley grain is shot into a 
cistern and covered with water to the depth of 5 inches 
and soaked for 40 to 60 hours, until it has swollen up 
and the process of germination has started. The wet grain 
is then removed from the steeping-tanks, piled up in 



126 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

heaps, called " couches," and allowed so to remain for 
20 to 48 hours, to enable it to develop sufficient heat to 
ensure equable and good germination. Thereafter it is 
spread out on floors, where rapid germination proceeds, 
the plumule growing up the back of the grain and the tiny 
rootlets being put forth. In 10 to 14 days the plumule is 
halfway to three-quarters up the back of the grain. Further 
growth is then stopped by running the malt on to the 
floors of the " kilns," where it is gradually heated until 
dry, when the heat is increased. If pale malt is desired, 
the temperature is not raised above 185 F., but for black 
or brown malts for black beers, the malt is caramelized. 
The heated malt is then sifted or screened, to get rid of the 
sproutlings ; the siftings are ground into " grist," and the 
grist is run into the " mash-tun," a large covered vessel, 
containing a proper proportion of the brewing-water, at a 
temperature of 140 to 152 F. for pale ales, and 144 to 
150 F. for black beers. In the mash-tun it is well mixed for 
15 to 30 minutes, allowed to stand for two hours more, and 
then the liquor, or " wort," run off into a receiving vessel. 
More water is run into the mash-tun, and the solids are 
washed or " sparged," the water not being used hotter than 
160 F. to prevent the solution of starch. After four hours' 
sparging the liquor is run off, the speed being increased 
as the solids settle, and is mixed with the first wort. The 
mixture is then boiled in the " copper," the larger portion 
of the hops added, and after one to two hours' boiling, run 
out and the hops allowed to settle. The bright, clear, 
supernatant liquid is then run into large flat trays or 
coolers, and over coils of pipes in which cold water is 
circulating (refrigerators), its temperature being reduced 
to a suitable one for fermentation (60 F. or under). At 
this stage the specific gravity of the wort is taken by the 
Excise officers with a Bates' saccharometer, which is a 
modified hydrometer. The Customs' standard is a sp. gr. 
of 1055 at 60 F. After allowing 6 per cent off for wastage, 
they charge 75. gd. per 36 gallons, as duty. The wort is 
now run into tuns made of wood, slate, or stone, about 
i Ib. of yeast per barrel being mixed with it as it is run in. 
Fermentation now takes place, and is continued until the 
beer reaches the specific gravity desired by the brewer. 



BEVERAGES 127 

The yeast is removed by skimming or otherwise, and the 
beer run into barrels. When about to be sent out to the 
" trade," it is subjected to " fining." Finings are made 
of isinglass, and are white or brown. They are added in 
the proportion of i to 2 pints per barrel ; 4 Ib. of isinglass 
dissolved in a hogshead of weak acid or sour beer con- 
stitutes the usual finings (hogshead = 63 wine, or 52-5 
' imperial gallons) . 

Beers from starches, glucose, invert sugar, etc., are 
similarly treated, beginning with the mash-tun. 

Brewing- Waters. A hard water free from nitrates 
and organic matter is preferred for brewing. It should 
also contain 10 to 15 grains per gallon of NaCl. The com- 
position of Burton water is taken as a standard in this 
country, and it contains n to 15 grains of carbonates of 
lime and magnesia, 40 to 60 of sulphate of lime, 12 to 30 of 
sulphate of magnesia, and 5 of chloride of Na and K. In 
the Dublin water the carbonates are about n grains per 
gallon, the sulphates only 0-8, and the chlorides 1-8. The 
sulphates and carbonates of Na and K are injurious, as 
are also any iron salts. The hard water does not take 
up so much albuminous matter from the malt. Nitrates 
restrain the growth of the yeast. Organic matter in the 
water spoils the keeping quality of the beer. 

Yeast. In England the " high " or surface fermentation 
is used (top yeast) ; in Germany the " low" or sedimen- 
tary process (bottom yeast) . The latter works at a lower 
temperature, and gives a more gaseous but less alcoholic 
beer. 

Composition. Beer consists of water, alcohol, maltose, 
dextrin, albuminoids, bitters, salts, carbonic acid gas, 
and acidity (acetic, lactic, succinic, etc.). Preservatives 
(salicylic acid, boric acid), saccharin (prohibited), and 
arsenic may be present. All the constituents vary greatly 
in the different makes. 

ANALYSIS. The beer is shaken, and poured from one 
vessel to another to get rid of the CO 2 gas, and the froth 
is got rid of by filtering through cotton-wool. Specific 
gravity : by bottle or Westphal, varies from 1006 to 1030 
(Bass 1013). Extract: evaporate 5 c.c. to dryness. See 



128 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

also under Addenda, page 130. (Bass 7 per cent). Ash : 
ignite extract at a low temperature. Under 0-5 per cent. 
Sodium chloride : extract ash with water and titrate with 
standard AgNO 3 . 

Acidity. Total. Titrate 20 c.c. of sample (well diluted) 
with N/io NaOH and litmus, and note number of c.c. 
required. Calculate as glacial acetic acid (i c.c. N/io 
soda = 0-006 grm. Ac). Is commonly 0-182 per cent, or 16 
grains per pint. 

Fixed : Dilute 20 c.c. to 100 c.c. and evaporate down to 
50 c.c. Dilute again, and titrate with N/io soda, i c.c. = 
0-009 g 1711 - lactic acid. Calculate to a percentage. 

Volatile : Deduct number of c.c. required for fixed acid 
from number required for total, and calculate as acetic. 

Alcohol. Two methods : 

1. By direct distillation. 100 c.c. of sample are taken in 
a distilling-flask, a small piece of pumice stone is added, 
and about 90 c.c. are distilled over. The distillate is cooled 
to 15-5 C., and made up with aq. dest. to 100 c.c. at the 
same temperature. The specific gravity is now taken by 
the bottle or Westphal balance. The amount of alcohol 
is then found from tables. 

2. Indirect or Tabarie's method. Take sp. gr. of sample 
carefully (at 15-5 C.). Take 100 c.c. and evaporate down 
to one-third of the bulk to get rid of alcohol and other 
volatile substances. Cool, make up to original bulk at 
I 5'5 C., and take sp. gr. again. Then the original sp. gr. 
-T- new sp. gr. = sp. gr. of an alcoholic water of same strength 
as beer. Find percentage from tables. Or, deduct 
difference between the two specific gravities from 1000, and 
the result is sp. gr. of an alcoholic water of same alcoholic 
strength as the sample of beer (average 5 per cent). 

Original Gravity of Beer Wort. This is sometimes 
needed to calculate the rebate or drawback of duty allowed 
when beer is exported. It is obtained by deducting the 
sp. gr. of the alcoholic distillate in (i) above from 1000. 
The number got is the " spirit indication," and from a 
table we get with its help the number of degrees of " gravity 
lost." This number, added to the sp. gr. obtained by 
Tabarie's method for the de-alcoholized beer, gives the 
original gravity of the beer wort. A further addition for 



BEVERAGES 129 

excess of acidity (over o-i per cent acetic) is also made 
by consulting another table. (Bass, 1056). 

Saccharin. Treat dried extract with anhydrous ether ; 
evaporate to dryness ; if residue sweet, infer presence of 
saccharin. 

Preservatives. Boric acid: test ash (as on page 80). 
Salicylic acid: kiln-dried malt contains a principle which 
gives an identical reaction with ferric chloride. Hence 
use Spica's test : Take 100 c.c. of beer, acidify with 
H 2 SO 4 ; extract with ether ; separate ether ; evaporate 
spontaneously ; and warm residue carefully with a drop 
of strong HNO 3 . If salicylic acid is present, picric acid 
is formed. Add AmOH or NaOH, and a bright-yellow 
picrate is formed, which will stain a woollen thread 
immersed in it. 

Arsenic. By Reinsch's test. Take 200 c.c. of sample, 
add 30 c.c. strong HC1 and a piece of clean bright copper 
foil \ in. x in. Boil for forty-five minutes, adding aq. 
dest. to keep up bulk as required. Cool, and examine 
copper foil. If clean and bright copper-coloured, As, Sb, 
and Hg are absent. If changed, there may be A s or Sb 
if deposit is black ; but if silvery, it is Hg. Wash gently 
with water, alcohol, and ether in succession. Dry at 100 C. 
Put in a perfectly dry 2-in. glass reduction tube, the upper 
part of which has been previously warmed. Heat gently. 
As, Sb, and Hg all sublime and condense in the upper part 
of the tube as, respectively, As 2 O 3 (crystals) ; Sb 2 O 3 
(amorphous) ; and Hg (globules). Examine sublimate 
magnified 200 times. Arsenic gives octahedral crystals. 
Antimony gives an amorphous mass. Mercury gives 
globules. If arsenic found, wash out sublimate with 
weak KOH solution and put two portions on a white slab : 
(i) Touch one with ammonia-cupric solution, when 
Scheele's green is formed ; (2) Touch other with ammonia- 
silver-nitrate solution canary-yellow precipitate. If 
antimony found, wash out with weak tartaric acid, which 
forms tartrated antimony. Add HC1 and H 2 S orange 
precipitate. If mercury found, expose to iodine vapour 
yellow iodide formed. A control should be done with the 
distilled water and the HC1 and copper foil. 

Marsh's and Gutzeit's tests are also used.

ADDENDA. A pint of good beer contains roughly i fl. oz. 
of alcohol, 1-5 oz. of sugary extract, 20 grains of free acid, 
14 grains of salts, and I pint of CO z gas in solution. The 
extract may be got from the sp. gr. of the de-alcoholized 
beer by dividing the excess over 1000 by 3-86. The 
difference between the sp. gr. of the beer and the sp. gr. 
of the de-alcoholized beer may be taken as the approximate 
spirit indication in calculating the original gravity of the 
beer wort, and deducted from 1000, gives sp. gr. of alcoholic 
water of same alcoholic strength as beer. 

WINE. 

Wine is the fermented juice of the grape, but much 
of it is made otherwise. The grapes are pressed or 
trodden (mechanical pressure extracts an excess of tannin 
and colouring matter from red grapes), and the juice or 
" must " ferments spontaneously from the yeast existing 
naturally on the skins, the glucose or grape sugar being 
converted into alcohol and C0 2 . When fermentation has 
ceased, the wine is run off from the residue or " lees," 
composed mainly of yeast cells and cream of tartar (KHT). 
The wine is kept- in casks in which a further fermentation 
takes place, resulting in the deposition of more KHT. It is 
then put into casks to mature or " age." In making white 
wine the must is separated from the skins and stalks, while 
for red wine the skins of purple grapes are fermented with 
the must. In grapes the relative amount of sugar and 
albuminous matter varies. The yeast fungus lives on the 
latter, and if it is used up before all the sugar is fermented 
a sweet wine results ; if the contrary happen,' a non-sweet 
or " dry " wine is obtained. The grape juice also contains 
tartaric acid and its salts, and the proportion of acid to 
sugar best adapted for wine production is i to 40. In some 
parts, if the acid is in excess, the must is diluted, and sugar 
(glucose or cane sugar) added in the necessary amount. 
To make dry wines, white of egg, gelatin, or .isinglass is 
added to feed the fungus until it ferments all the sugar. 

ANALYSIS. 

Specific gravity : varies. Extract. 2^4 per cent. 

Alcohol. By distillation : 6 to 17 per cent. 



BEVERAGES 131 

Ash. o-i to 0-3 per cent. About one-sixth is P 2 O ; -. 

Acidity. (i) Fixed as tartaric. Dilute 20 c.c., boil down, 
repeat, add water, and titrate with N/io NaOH, using 
phenolphthalein as indicator (0-5 per cent and under) ; 
(2) Volatile acid : 20 c.c. of the wine are well diluted* and 
then titrated with N/io soda, using phenolphthalein as 
before. Deduct number of c.c. required for fixed acid 
from number now obtained, and multiply difference by 
0-006 = volatile acid as acetic. The fixed acidity is 
calculated as tartaric : i c.c. N/io NaOH = 0-0075 grm. 
tartaric acid. 

Sugar. Take 50 to 100 c.c., boil off the alcohol, remove 
colouring matter and other bodies with slight excess of 
basic lead acetate, filter, remove lead, and treat with 
Fehling's solution after dilution to 200 c.c. Varies from 
o to 5 per cent ; in champagne, 4 to 10 per cent. 

Preservatives. Salicylic acid, formaldehyde, sulphites. 
Boric acid is said to be naturally present in some wines. 

Colouring Matter. Soak gelatin (10 per cent) cubes in 
sample for twenty-four hours, then cut them diagonally. 
Natural wine colour penetrates less than one-eighth of an 
inch, but artificial colours through and through. Or, the 
Paris Municipal Laboratory test : Take a piece of recently 
calcined lime and wet it with a few drops of the wine. 
Natural red wine gives a yellowish-brown coloration ; wine 
coloured with fuchsin or Brazil wood gives a rose colour, 
and wine coloured with logwood gives a reddish violet. Or, 
baryta water is added until solution is green, and then acetic 
ether, and shake. Allow to stand until acetic ether separ- 
ates, when if coloured, basic dyes present, if not, probably 
only natural colour. Or, add diluted KOH until alkaline, 
then mercuric acetate, filter ; filtrate is red or yellow if 
acid aniline dyes present, colourless if pure wine colour. 

Adulteration. Addition of tannin, alum, catechu; 
plastering (addition of gypsum) ; blending ; pasteuriza- 
tion ; saccharin. 

Piquette. An artificial substitute for wine, manufac- 
tured in France (50 million gallons were made and con- 
sumed in 1898). One pound of raisins and one pound of 
dried apples are added to one gallon of water ; expose 
mixture in an open vessel to the air for three days ; then 



132 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

bottle, adding one-half teaspoonful of sugar and a small 
piece of cinnamon to each bottle. 

Cider. Is the fermented juice of the apple. Contains 
about 3 to 5 per cent of alcohol. 

Perry. The fermented juice of the pear ; alcoholic 
strength tends to be higher than in cider. 

SPIRITS. 

Spirits are all made by the distillation of alcohol produced 
by the fermentation of various saccharine or starchy 
materials, such as fruit juices, grain, and molasses. The 
essential constituent is ethyl alcohol, but they also contain 
varying proportions of other alcohols, ethers, and other 
fragrant bodies, and in some cases added substances. 

Ethyl Alcohol (C 2 H 5 -OH) is commonly denoted simply 
alcohol. It is a liquid which boils at 78 C., and at 20 C. 
has a sp. gr. of 789. It oxidizes to acetic acid (CH 3 -COOH.) 

Brandy is made by the distillation of fermented grape 
juice. It is at first colourless, but is stored in casks which 
give it an amber colour. Sp. gr. is usually about 930, alcohol 
is 48 to 56 per cent, and total solids are about o-i per cent. 
Besides alcohol and water, it contains traces of various 
ethers, aldehydes, and acids (chiefly acetic). Imitation 
brandy is made from grain spirit flavoured with various 
esters and oils (cloves, cassia), and coloured with caramel. 

Whiskey or Whisky (Gaelic, uisgebeatha water of 
life) is made by distillation from malted barley, oats, or 
rye which has been fermented. It is stored in sherry 
casks which flavour and colour it. Numerous imitations 
exist, especially from potato spirit. Alcohol, 44 to 50 per 
cent ; total solids, 0-15 per cent ; acidity as acetic, o-l 
per cent. Specific gravity, 935 to 945. 

Rum is made by the distillation of the fermented juice 
of the sugar cane or from molasses (the drained syrup from 
which sugar does not crystallize on boiling) and coloured 
with caramel. Its characteristic odour is due to ethyl 
butyrate. Alcohol, 40 to 50 per cent ; total solids, 0-7 to 
1-5 per cent. 

Gin is made by distillation from fermented grain 
flavoured with juniper berries, oil of turpentine, oil of 



BEVERAGES 133 

juniper, coriander seeds, capsicum, etc., with or without 
the subsequent addition of cane sugar (to sweeten it). It 
acts on the kidneys. Alcohol, 30 to 40 per cent. Hollands 
and Schnapps are varieties from rye. 

Proof Spirit is a term in use for excise purposes, denoting 
a dilute spirit of definite strength. It contains of absolute 
alcohol if expressed as (i) Volume in volume, 57-05 per cent ; 
(i in 1*753) ; (2) Weight in volume, 42-46 per cent (i in 
2 '355) ' (3) Weight in weight, 49-25 per cent (i in 2-03). 
Spirits weaker than proof spirit are said to be under proof, 
and when stronger to be over proof. Sp. gr., 919-8 at 15 C. 
Whisky containing 60 per cent of alcohol volume in 
volume, is equal per 100 measures to 60 X 1-753 = 105-18 
measures of proof spirit, and is said to be 5-18 over 
proof ; but if it contains only 30 per cent of alcohol volume 
in volume, then 100 volumes less 52-59 47-41 under proof. 

ANALYSIS. 

Alcohol. By direct distillation after diluting sample 
with an equal bulk of water to prevent loss of alcohol 
from too rapid evolution and imperfect condensation. By 
the Sale of Food and Drugs Amendment Act, 1879, 
brandy, whisky, and rum must not be weaker than 25 
under proof ( = 75 per cent proof spirit) , and gin not weaker 
than 35 under proof (= 65 per cent proof spirit). 

Acidity. The fixed may be determined on the residue 
from the distillation by titration with N/io baryta or soda, 
and phenolphthalein. The volatile is got by titrating the 
sample, deducting the number of c.c. required for fixed 
acid, and calculating as acetic acid. The fixed is returned 
as tartaric acid. Spirits should not contain any fixed acid. 

Total Solids. Evaporate on the water-bath and dry to 
constant weight in water-oven. 

Ash. Ignite residue. 

Ethers (compound). These are calculated as so many 
parts per 100,000 of alcohol, and the usual amount in 
brandy is about 100, in whisky from 10 to 90, and in rum 
the extremes are as great as 30 to 400. 

Furfurol is an aldehyde, and is present in pot-still, 
but not in patent-still spirit. It is tested for by adding 
10 drops of colourless aniline oil to 10 c.c. of distillate 
(made down to 50 per cent of alcohol), and i c.c. of acetic 



134 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

acid (free from alcohol). A rose tint appears, which is 
compared with that from 10 c.c. of standard solution of 
furfurol (0-005 g 011 - P er litre) similarly treated. From I 
to 3 parts per 100,000. Formula: C 4 H 3 OCHO. 

Fusel Oil (Amyl Alcohols, C 5 H,,'OH). Spirits should 
never contain more than o-i per cent amyl alcohol, as such. 
Tests : Distil off ethyl alcohol from 100 c.c. on water- 
bath and take residue. Add an equal bulk of water, cool, 
and extract with ether. Let ether evaporate at room 
temperature and divide residue into three parts. 

1. Heat one portion with sulphuric acid and a little potas- 
sium bichromate ; a smell of valerianic acid is obtained. 

2. Heat with sulphuric acid and sodium acetate, when 
the odour of jargonelle pears (acetate of amyl) is got. 

3. Warm with double its volume of strong sulphuric acid ; 
violet-red colour of amyl sulphuric acid is formed. 

Aldehydes. Vary from 10 to 40 parts per 100 litres of 
alcohol (100,000 parts). 

Higher Alcohols. From 100 to 250 parts per 100,000 
parts of absolute alcohol. 

Total Secondary Products, or " the co-efficient of im- 
purities," is the sum total of the free acid, aldehyde, fur- 
furol, ethers, and higher alcohols. According to the Lancet 
Commission this co-efficient varies for a specially fine 
brandy from 300 to 646, bat may tall to 250 per 100,000 of 
absolute alcohol in inferior but genuine brandy. Grain and 
beet spirits are comparatively free of secondary products, 
furfurol especially being absent. Gin is also low in total 
secondary products. Jamaica rum is very high in ethers 
(400 grm. of ethyl acetate per 100 litres of absolute alcohol 
present) and contains more acids and furfurol than brandy. 
Whisky closely resembles brandy, but the furfurol is high. 

Specific gravity is frequently ascertained by Sykes' hydro- 
meter, the temperature of the liquid being noted, and the 
result obtained from special tables, which give the amount 
that the sample is over or under proof. If there is much 
solids the spirit must be distilled as for beer and wine. 

Methyl Alcohol, CH 3 'OH (wood spirit). Is a liquid 
which boils at 66 C., and at 20 C. has a sp. gr. of 796. 
From it are derived formaldehyde (H'CHO) and formic 
acid (H-COOH). 



CHAPTER VII. 

DISINFECTANTS, ANTISEPTICS, AND 
DEODORANTS. 

A DISINFECTANT is an agent which destroys the causes of 
disease and their products, such as fire, steam (saturated), 
boiling water, hot air, and chemicals in a proper strength 
(5 per cent carbolic acid, 5 per cent permanganate of 
potash, o-i per cent of perchloride of mercury, formalin, 
cyllin, lysol, etc., and Cl, Br, and I and ozone). 

An antiseptic is an agent which arrests or impedes the 
growth of micro-organisms without destroying their 
vitality. Most of the disinfectants act thus in the weaker 
strengths, as do also borax and boracic acid, sulphites and 
sulphurous acid, salicylates and salicylic acid, essential 
oils, quinine and other alkaloids, and common salt. 

A deodorant is an agent which masks or destroys the 
effluvia produced by certain micro-organisms. Deodorants 
include nitrous acid fumes, chlorine fumes (from chloride 
of lime), sulphurous acid fumes, fumes of wood, tar, and 
burnt paper, and some of the disinfectants in virtue of 
their oxidizing power or their strong odour, such as 
permanganate of potash and carbolic acid. 

Direct sunlight and fresh air are powerful factors in, and 
aids to, disinfection, antisepsis, and deodorization. 

Bleaching Powder is prepared by passing Cl gas over 
slaked lime, when a compound is formed having the 
formula Ca (OC1) Cl, which liberates Cl gas on treatment 
with acids. Theoretically it should contain 56 per cent of 
available Cl ; a good bleaching powder commercially is 
one which gives 35 per cent of available Cl. 

Ca(OCl)Cl + 2 HC1 = CaCl 2 + H 2 O + Cl 2 . 

Process. Pinot's Method. 

Solutions required : (i) Standard arsenious solution. 
Dissolve 4-95 grm. of pure arsenious oxide in about 



136 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

250 c.c. of water, along with 25 grm. of sodic carbonate. 
Boil for some time until all the oxide is dissolved, cool, and 
make up to i litre. This is decinormal strength and can 
be standardized against N/io I. ; (2) N/io iodine solution ; 
(3) Starch and KI paper as indicator. Take 2-5 grm. 
of sample and rub up with successive quantities of 
water until all the powder is transferred to a 250 c.c. 
flask to which the washings are added. Make up to the 
mark, shake well, and taking 20 c.c. of the milky fluid, 
titrate with the standard arsenious solution until starch and 
KI paper is no longer blued on being touched with a drop 
of the mixture removed on a glass rod. As excess of the 
arsenious solution is easily added, it is usual to now add 
starch to the titrated liquid and titrate with N/io iodine 
until a permanent blue is got. The amount of the N/io I 
used is deducted ;rom the amount of arsenious solution 
required, and as i c.c. As 2 O 3 solution = 0-00355 g rm - 
Cl, or 3-55 mgr. Cl, the amount of Cl is easily calculated 
and is returned as a percentage. 

2 Ca(OCl)Cl-r-2 H 2 O+ As 2 O 3 = As 2 O 5 -f 2 CaCl 2 +2 H 2 O. 

Formalin is a 40 per cent solution in water of formalde- 
hyde (CH 2 O), the qualitative tests for which have been 
given on page 80. Quantitatively it is tested as follows : 
Weigh out 2-075 grm. of formaldehyde sample, and dilute 
with water to 500 c.c. Take 10 c.c. of this dilution and 
mix with 25 c.c. of N/io iodine solution in a flask. Add 
NaOH solution (15 per cent) drop by drop until the liquid 
becomes clear yellow, and allow to stand for ten minutes. 
Then add sufficient dilute HC1 to liberate the iodine not 
acted on by the formalin, and titrate the amount of I with 
N/io thiosulphate ; the number of c.c. of thiosulphate 
required .subtracted from 25, gives the number of c.c. of 
N/io I absorbed, i c.c. N/io I = 0-0015 grm. CH 2 O. 
H-CHO + H 2 O + 1 2 = H-COOH + 2HI. 

Permanganate of Potash. The solution is titrated 
with standard ferrous sulphate solution in presence of 
sulphuric acid. Take 5 c.c.or 10 c.c. of sample (the smaller 
the amount the stronger the sample), add 10 c.c. of 25 
per cent H 2 SO 4 , and from a burette add standard FeSO 4 
solution until colourless. Calculate to a percentage. 



DISINFECTANTS, ETC. 137 

Ferrous Sulphate. Reverse the above process, using 
a standard solution of permanganate : K 2 Mn 2 O 8 -f- 
ioFeSO 4 . 7 H 2 + 8 H 2 SO 4 = K 2 SO 4 + -2 MnSO 4 -f 
5 Fe 2 (SO 4)3+ I5H 2 O. The standard solutions can be 
made any .suitable strengths, but as we have already in 
use a solution of permanganate, 3-95 grm. to I litre, it can 
be used for the ferrous sulphate : i c.c. = 0-03475 grm. 
FeSO 4 7H 2 O. Similarly, standard ferrous sulphate solu- 
tion 34-75 grm. per litre, i c.c. = 3-95 mgr. permanganate. 

Carbolic Acid, or phenol, C 6 H 5 OH, is detected 
qualitatively : (i) By its odour ; (2) Add a few drops of 
ferric chloride a violet coloration discharged by acetic 
acid (distinction from salicylic acid) ; (3) Bromine water 
gives a yellowish- white precipitate of tribromophenol, 
even in very dilute solutions ; (4) Add one-fourth volume 
of ammonia and then a few drops of dilute bleaching- 
powder solution a blue colour develops. 

Quantitatively, carbolic acid is estimated by the process 
of Koppeschaar. The phenol is precipitated as tri-bromo- 
phenol by the addition of excess of bromine solution. The 
overplus of bromine is determined by adding potassium 
iodide from which the bromine displaces iodine, and the 
amount of the latter is found by titration with N/io 
sodium thiosulphate solution. 

C 6 H 5 -OH + 3 Br 2 = C 6 H 2 Br 3 -OH + 3 HBr. 
Br + 2KI = 2KBr + I. 



2Na 2 S 2 O 3 + I 2 = Na 2 S 4 O e 

The bromine solution used may be N/io, or can have its 
strength estimated at the time in terms of iodine and 
sodium thiosulphate. 

Process. Weigh out 1*556 grm. of the sample, and 
dissolve in sufficient water to make 1000 c.c. Take 25 c.c. 
of dilution (= 0-0389 grm. of specimen) in a glass-stop- 
pered bottle ; add 30 c.c. N/io bromine solution ; 5 c.c. of 
strong hydrochloric acid ; and 5 c.c. of potassium iodide 
solution (20 per cent weight in volume). Stopper bottle 
quickly and shake well. Remove stopper and wash neck 
and stopper, allowing washings to run into bottle. Add 
i c.c. of chloroform and shake mixture. Titrate with N/io 



138 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

sodium thiosulphate solution, and number of c.c. of same 
required subtracted from 30 gives number of c.c. of 
N/io bromine solution absorbed. From the quantities 
taken, this number, multiplied by four, gives percentage 
of phenol in sample. 

The chief impurities in carbolic acid are the light and 
heavy coal-tar oils, which are largely composed of hydro- 
carbons of the benzene series. The light oils float on water, 
and the heavy sink; hence the terminology. In " carbolic 
powders " there is sometimes very little phenol, it being 
replaced by cresols or sulphites. Even when present the 
phenol may be rendered inert by having lime as a basis 
instead of silica. Pure phenol crystallizes in long colourless 
prisms, melts at 42 C., boils at i83C., is soluble in water 
(i part in 15 at 20 C.), and is very soluble in alcohol, ether, 
benzene, chloroform, carbon disulphide, and glacial acetic 
acid. Commercial phenol is a colourless crystalline mass, 
which gradually acquires a reddish colour, and deliquesces 
on exposure to the air. 

Cresols are found in coal tar, give a blue colour with 
ferric chloride, and are otherwise similar to phenol. They 
are hydroxy derivatives of toluene or methyl-benzene, and 
are known as ortho-, meta-, and para-cresol, all of them 
being present in coal tar and in the tar from pine and 
beech woods. Ortho-cresol melts at 31 C. and boils at 
188 C. ; meta-cresol at 4 to 5 C. and 201 C. ; and 
para-cresol at 36 C. and 198 C., respectively. Creosote is 
obtained by distillation of wood tar, and contains among 
other things cresols and guaiacol. 

Carbolic Powders. A good powder should contain 
not less than 15 per cent of tar acids (crude carbolic acid), 
of which 62-5 per cent is crystallizable at 15 to 20 C. 
when examined by C. Low's test. The base should 
contain no lime or chalk. Test reaction of powder with 
litmus. If alkaline, it contains free lime. If otherwise, 
the base is probably siliceous. 

EXAMINATION. 

i. If the base is silica. Mix the powder well and take 
50 grm. Extract with 150 c.c. of methylated spirit, 
which dissolves all the tar acids not in combination with 
lime. Now separate, and mix extract with 50 c.c. of 10 per 



DISINFECTANTS, ETC. 139 

cent KOH or NaOH. Distil off spirit and evaporate to 
about 30 c.c., and cool. If any tar oils separate out, filter 
them off, run the filtrate into a burette, and add cautiously 
and a little at a time, 50 per cent sulphuric acid, until the 
alkali present is completely neutralized. The tar acids 
are liberated, and will rise to the surface and form a separate 
layer, the volume of which can be read off. As the sp. gr. 
of crude carbolic acid is about 1050, the volume x 1-05 
will give the weight, and the result x 2 gives the percentage 
of available carbolic acid present in the powder. 

2. This method extracts all the carbolic present, and is 
suitable for samples which contain free lime. 50 grm. 
of the previously well-mixed powder are placed in a large 
mortar, and a cold mixture of equal parts of sulphuric 
acid and water (i.e., 50 per cent) is added drop by drop, 
with constant stirring, until all the lime has been converted 
into sulphate, and the mixture is just acid. This is 
determined by repeated testing with litmus, removing and 
moistening a small fragment of the powder. The process 
must not be hurried, or heat sufficient to volatilize the 
free phenol present will be generated (takes one hour). 
The result is a dry powder, free from lumps. If it is 
moist, add some calcium sulphate. Now extract with four 
lots of ether, filtering each time the supernatant ether 
through a small filter into 50 c.c. of 10 per cent NaOH. 
Agitate well and distil off the ether (almost). Transfer to 
a separator, washing out flask with small quantities of 
water and ether, which are added to the same. Separate, 
wash ethereal layer with water, separate again, and mix 
with first lot. Reduce bulk by evaporation to 30 c.c., 
transfer to a burette, and treat as in (i). 

Sodium Sulphite and Sulphurous Acid. See page 
121. 

Zinc Chloride. Estimate gravimetrically by precipita- 
tion with Am 2 S, filter, dry, ignite, and weigh as ZnO. 

Copper Sulphate. Precipitate as CuO \\ith NaOH. 
Collect, dry, ignite, and weigh as CuO. 



The " Lancet " Commission appointed to inquire into 
the Standardization of Disinfectants, issued a report, which 



140 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

is published in the " Lancet " for 1909, Vol. ii., pages 1454 
(Chemical), 1516 (Bacteriological), and 1612 (Summary and 
Conclusions) . 

The chemical part is here dealt with. Disinfectant is 
taken to mean a substance capable of destroying disease 
germs, or a " germicide," which is a preferable word. 

CHEMICAL ANALYSIS. 

Arguing that disinfection is a chemical process, the 
standards laid down are these : 

1. A standardized disinfectant should contain a certain 
proportion of an accredited germicidal substance ; and 

2. If it is presented as a soapy mixture, which makes 
an emulsion with water, such dilution in water should 
show active Brownian movements of the particles 
distributed in the mixture. 

The coal-tar disinfectants form the majority of those 
sold to the public. They consist of varying quantities of 
phenolic bodies, with inert tar oils, and in many cases 
soap and resins or other emulsifying agents, such as gelatin 
or dextrin, etc. The analysis of these mixtures necessitates 
the separation of the soap, resin, or oily hydrocarbons 
present, before the presence of phenol, cresol, or other 
phenoloid body can be properly tested for. The existing 
methods were found to be inconvenient, tedious, and 
troublesome, and the following method was devised and 
worked out by testing a large series of these mixtures. 
Distillation methods were avoided, because of the relatively 
large quantity of disinfectant required, and the incon- 
venience of the operations in any but a technical 
laboratory, while solvent processes were objected to, on 
account of the difficulty in separating the solvent, and 
also because no differentiation of the kind of phenol 
present was attempted. 

The Lancet-Acetone-Baryta (L.A.B.) Method. 

i. For fluids containing soaps and resins as emulsifiers. 
The process consists in making an emulsion with a known 
weight of the disinfectant mixed with water ; precipitating 
the soaps and (or) resins by adding a strong solution of 



DISINFECTANTS, ETC. 141 

baryta ; filtering, when all the phenols are in the filtrate, 
and are estimated as later described. The residue on the 
filter contains the soaps and resins as barium compounds, 
and the neutral oils. On shaking it up with acetone, the 
neutral oils are dissolved out, and on filtration again, the 
residue left, if treated with HC1, yields free fatty acids 
and resins, which can be dissolved out with ether, the 
ether evaporated, and the residue weighed. The acetone 
filtrate containing the neutral oils can be examined for 
these. 

Process. Take 10 grm. of disinfecting fluid, in a 
300 c.c. Erlenmeyer flask. Add 100 c.c. of distilled water, 
and shake well. Now add 15 grm. of barium hydrate 
crystals, attach flask to a reflux condenser, and digest at 
100 C. for half an hour by immersion in a water-bath, 
shaking at intervals. Cool, and while cooling spread out 
the soaps and resins with a glass rod. Decant off clear 
liquid (baryta solution), or filter through an asbestos plug 
by aid of water suction. In either case, wash out flask 
with warm baryta solution, and decant after settling, or filter 
into previous filtrate, making up bulk to 250 or 300 c.c. 
exactly. Of the filtrate, 50 c.c. are taken in a separator, 
HC1 is added till acid, and then some CaCl z . The liberated 
phenols are extracted with ether. On separation the ether is 
evaporated by putting the fluid in a tall glass flask, which 
is put on a hot plate at 37 C., and evaporation encouraged 
by blowing a current of air into the flask. The residue 
is in this way also made water- free, and on cooling is 
weighed in the flask. The weight of the flask is deducted, 
and the remainder is the weight of phenol bodies present. 
This is tested, as if it were pure phenol, by the bromine 
absorption process. The residue is dissolved in NaOH, 
excess of bromine solution in NaOH added, and then HC1. 
The phenol present absorbs bromine. The amount of un- 
used Br is measured by adding KI, and titrating the iodine 
liberated in place of bromine, with N/io sodium thio- 
sulphate solution. The difference from the amount of 
bromine added (determined by a blank experiment) is the 
amount of bromine absorbed. This multiplied by the figure 
0-195, gives the equivalent amount of carbolic acid present. 
Any notable difference of this amount from the weight of 



142 PUBLIC HEALTH CHEMISTRY 

the residue, shows that the phenoloid present is not 
phenol (C 6 H 5 OH). 

C 6 H 5 .OH + 3- Br 2 = C 6 H 2 Br 3 .OH + 3 .HBr. 

94 480 

The water present may be obtained by adding to 
25 grm. of the fluid, exactly 10 c.c. of 10 per cent sulphuric 
acid, and then 25 c.c. of petroleum (white spirit). Shake 
well, and allow to settle. The clear under liquid is 
accurately measured in a narrow graduated cylinder, and 
the increase above 10 c.c. is taken as amount of water in 
25 grm. of disinfecting fluid. 

The analyses undertaken showed a range of 5 to 66 per 
cent in phenolic bodies, and 39 to 94 per cent in inert bodies 
such as soap, resin, neutral oils, alkalies, and water. 

2. For fluids containing neither soap nor resin as 
emulsifiers. There are preparations in which gelatin (in 
izal) and dextrin (in okol) are used as emulsifiers. In these 
the use of baryta is omitted, but the phenoloids are 
dissolved right away in excess of absolute alcohol or 
acetone, which also precipitates the gelatin or dextrin. 
Any neutral oils present are in this case along with the 
phenoloids, so that the residue left is the dextrin or 
gelatin. The neutral oils are got by adding to the solution 
in acetone, 10 per cent NaOH, and diluting freely. They 
may be dissolved out by addition of 20 c.c. of petroleum 
spirit. From the filtrate, the phenoloids are estimated 
as before. 

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS. 

On tabulating the results along with the carbolic acid 
co-efficients found in the bacteriological investigation 
it was seen that the wider the difference between the 
percentage of phenoloids present and the equivalent of 
these in carbolic acid (calculated from the bromine 
absorption of the phenoloids), the higher was the car- 
bolic acid co-efficient of the disinfectant for B. Coli. 
In fact, the differences between these two figures, that 
is the percentage of phenoloids and the calculated 
equivalent of this in carbolic acid, formed a series 
running parallel with that of the co-efficients, with few 



DISINFECTANTS, ETC. 143 

exceptions. When these differences were all divided by 3, 
the series of numbers were in many cases identical with, 
or very close to, the carbolic acid co-efficient independently 
arrived at for each substance. In the cases where there 
was a divergence, the disinfectant did not form an emulsion 
with water, and the solution did not exhibit Brownian 
movements. Thus, it was deduced that the formula 
(P - B) -h 3 gives the carbolic acid co-efficient for B. coli 
of the disinfectant tested, where P is the percentage of 
phenoloids present, B the carbolic acid equivalent of 
these (calculated), and 3 an arbitrary constant. 

From a chemico-physical point of view, it is concluded 
that for tar disinfectants, at any rate, they should contain 
a reasonable quantity of active bodies, phenols or 
phenoloids, and that the dilution of them in water should 
show active Brownian movements, that is, should form a 
satisfactory emulsion. The formula (P B) -4-3 gives a 
ready means of estimating the carbolic co-efficient of a 
disinfectant, and its value should be at least over unity, 
that is, be equal to pure carbolic acid. A number of the 
disinfectants at present in common use give values of 
5 to 9 by this method.

PART II. 
PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY. 

TI) ACTERIOLOGY is one of the more recent sciences, 
-D and is becoming larger and more complex every 
year. It is now of extreme importance to the Hygienist, 
as it is also to the Agriculturalist, and in various Arts 
and Industries. A short glance at its evolution will serve 
to make the methods and processes to be hereinafter 
studied more intelligible. 

Leeuwenhoek, a native of Delft, in Holland, produced 
the first really good microscope and, on examining with it 
the contents of the intestinal canal in horses, frogs, pigeons, 
and fowls, and his own diarrhoea stools, he saw small moving 
and living forms. This was in 1675, and eight years later 
he examined tartar scraped from teeth, and described 
and depicted minute organisms such as we recognize at 
the present day. These discoveries accorded with various 
theories which were prevalent at the time, and a micro- 
organismal basis for disease became widely accepted, 
which, though much the same as prevails now, was built 
on very slender foundations. Plenciz thereafter insisted 
on the specific character of the contagious diseases, and 
explained the incubation period as dependent on the 
growth of a germ in the body, which had not yet made its 
presence manifest. Miiller systematized the morphology. 
Then the theory of spontaneous generation or abiogenesis 
arose. Dr. Needham boiled a beef infusion, kept it in a 
well-stoppered bottle, and found that, on keeping, it putre- 
fied. He argued that the boiling killed all the organisms 
in the infusion , and that therefore the putrefaction of the 
infusion pointed to the existence of a special vegetative 
force which produced fresh organisms. Spallanzani worked 
at the subject, and found that on boiling for one hour and 
then hermetically sealing, no putrefaction ensued. It was 
objected that the air was shut from the vessel, and that 
this might be necessary. This objection was met by 
Schulze in 1836 by fitting a flask with right-angled tubes, 



PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 149 

and filtering all the air through sulphuric acid in the one 
and potash in the other. Schroeder and von Dusch found 
(in 1854) that filtration through cotton-wool sufficed, 
and then Hoffmann, Chevreul, and Pasteur showed that 
it was quite sufficient to draw out the neck of the bottle 
and bend it downwards ; and they argued that germs 
obeyed the laws of gravitation in the absence of wind. 
Pasteur demonstrated that there was a causal relation 
between certain lowly organized parasitic organisms and 
certain diseases of animals and insects. His conclusions 
were attacked on two grounds : (i) that these organisms 
were not the cause of disease at all, and (2) that the germs 
were not specific, i.e., one for each fermentation or disease. 
The second objection was a forcible one because, so far, he 
had not been working with pure cultures. The first one was 
met by the researches of Lemaire, who proved that carbolic 
acid was hurtful to the life of the higher animals and plants, 
and that the addition of a small quantity of it to fluids 
prevented the incidence of putrefaction and fermentation 
but did not retard the action of diastase or synaptase. He 
applied the same reasoning to the treatment of wounds, 
and reduced pus to a minimum and got rapid healing, 
which results he attributed to the destruction of the 
microzoa and infusoria by the carbolic acid lotions. Lister 
saw the great importance of. Pasteur's work, and on it and 
independent research he built up against considerable 
opposition the theory and practice of antiseptic surgery. 
Pathogenic bacteria were also being studied, beginning 
with Bacillus anthracis, which was first observed by 
Pollender in 1849, and described by Davaine and Rayer 
in 1850 as motionless, thread-like organisms and rods, 
found in the blood taken from animals affected with 
splenic fever. In 1863 Davaine suggested that these rods 
were the actual and specific cause of the disease, and in 
1864 he demonstrated (not rigorously) that malignant 
pustule and splenic fever were forms of one infection. 
Confusion was introduced by the revival of the theory of 
polymorphism in the form that all contagia and miasmata 
are the products of fungi or algae, and on account of their 
small size are able to pass through the fine capillary vessels, 
and that when a micrococcus was found it was only 



150 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

necessary to trace it back to some parent fungus or mould. 
This not improbable theory was, even in its crude form, 
not easily met, as at that time no one was working with 
pure cultures. Klebs in 1872 described in pus, rod-like 
bodies and " microspores," grouped in short chains or in 
longer threads ; and he filtered the pus through baked clay 
cylinders, and found that the filtrate on injection into the 
blood or under the skin gave constitutional symptoms, but 
did not induce suppuration nor cause death ; though if to 
it were added a small quantity of the micro-organisms, a 
true pyaemia was produced. 

Koch in 1876 demonstrated the specificity of the anthrax 
bacillus by making it satisfy the following four conditions, 
commonly called Koch's postulates, namely : 

1. The anthrax bacillus was invariably found in the 
blood or tissues of animals affected with the disease. 

2. The bacillus was cultivated in artificial media for an 
indefinite number of successive generations. 

3. The same disease was produced by inoculation of a 
susceptible animal with the last cultivation. 

4. In every such inoculated animal the specific microbe 
was found, and similarly distributed as in animals infected 
in the ordinary way. 

To these Martin adds : 

5. The secondary infective agent or toxin separable 
from the tissues in the natural disease, should have similar 
chemical and physiological actions to the products 
obtained from a pure cultivation of the organism. 

Koch succeeded in doing this by being able to make 
pure cultures of the anthrax bacillus on the aqueous humour 
of the eye of the ox, and in this way was able to carry 
out the further procedures, and to accept the results as due 
to the single substance inserted. 

Numerous similar investigations were now made, and 
served to corroborate the soundness of the germ theory of 
disease. 

The introduction of solid media by Koch in 1882 paved 
the way for an enormous advance in bacteriological 
technique, and numerous discoveries of specific organisms 
followed, or specificity wa^> established : Staphylococci in 
1880-83, Streptococci 1881-84, Micrococcus tetragenus

CHAPTER IX. 
GENERAL PRINCIPLES. 
BACTERIOLOGICAL MEDIA 
may be thus classified : 

Nutrient Broth, standardized. 

Derivatives : Glucose broth, lactose broth, nutrient 

gelatin, nutrient agar-agar, glycerin agar, glucose 

agar, lactose agar. 
Peptone Water. 

Derivatives : Glucose peptone water, lactose 

peptone water, sucrose and mannite peptone 

water. 
MacConkey's Media. Bile-salt litmus glucose peptone 

water ; bile-salt neutral-red lactose agar. 
Other Media. Milk, potato, blood serum, ascitic fluid, 

urine, whey, gelatin agar, beer wort, bread, 

eggs ; nitrate media, synthetic media ; animal 

tissues, etc. 

Nutrient Broth. 500 grm. of lean beef finely minced 
are steeped in one litre of ordinary water for twenty-four 
hours in a cool place. The fat particles are then skimmed 
off, the fluid strained off, and the juice well pressed out. 
This is then boiled for half an hour to coagulate the 
albumins, filtered, and the bulk made up to I litre. One 
per cent of Witte's peptones and | per cent of common salt 
are then added and dissolved by the aid of heat. The 
broth is now tested as to its reaction, and is usually acid. 
Its acidity is determined by taking 5 c.c., diluting to 50 c.c. 



152 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

with water, adding i c.c. of phenolphthalein, and titrating 
with N/io NaOH. Boil one minute before titration. 
Calculate the amount of N/i NaOH required for the litre 
of broth made. The convention at present in use is to 
leave the broth acid to phenolphthalein to the extent that 
i c.c. of N/i NaOH is required to neutralize 100 c.c. of 
broth, or 10 c.c. per litre, and the medium is said to be 
" acid + 10," or -f i per cent. Therefore add the calcu- 
lated amount of N/i NaOH less 10. (Some add the full 
amount of soda and then make acid to the desired extent 
with N/i HC1.) Heat to boiling and test again ; if it needs 
a further correction, boil again. Allow to cool to bring 
down the precipitate of MgAm phosphate caused by the 
change of reaction. Filter, place in flasks or tubes (about 
5 c.c.), and sterilize in autoclave at 120 C. for 15 minutes, 
or at 130 C. for i minute, or for 15 to 60 minutes on 
three successive days in a steam sterilizer at 100 C. 

Broth can also be made from Liebig's Extract of Meat, 
using 0*5 per cent of it instead of mince-meat. The other 
procedure is similar. Neutralization can also be effected 
by adding saturated solution of NaOH until red litmus is 
just turned blue. 

Meat Extract or Fleischwasser can be used as a basis for 
broth and the media derived from it. It is made by 
warming 500 grm. of minced beef or horseflesh with 
i litre of water at 50 C. for half an hour, and then boiling 
for half to three-quarters of an hour. Filter, strain, make 
up to i litre, and then pour into a flask ; if not to be used 
at once, sterilize. 

Broth contains some muscle sugar or inosite, and to 
get rid of this is at times inoculated with a young culture 
of B. coli and incubated at 37 C. for 18 hours, and then 
boiled to kill the organisms. 

Glucose and Lactose are added to sugar-free broth (usually 
i per cent). Such media are not sterilized in the autoclave 
but in a steamer, because the sugars are not stable at 
high temperatures. 

Nutrient Gelatin is made from broth by adding 10 per 
cent in winter and 15 per cent in summer of " gold label" 
gelatin. Heat on water-rbath (as little as possible) to 
dissolve ; readjust reaction (gelatin makes the medium 



GENERAL PRINCIPLES 153 

acid), filter, and sterilize in the steamer. If nitrate is 
not clear, cool to 60 C., add whites of two eggs per litre, 
re-heat for hali-an-hour in steamer, and filter through 
Chardin paper in warm filter-jacket. 

Nutrient Agar. Add 1-5 per cent of powdered agar to 
broth. Melt in the steamer at 100 C. for 1-5 hours. 
Standardize, and replace in steamer for 20 minutes to. 
precipitate phosphates. Cool to 60 C., add two whites of 
egg per litre, reheat for half an hour, filter through Chardin 
paper by aid of a hot-water funnel or in a steamer, or filter 
through- glass-wool. Tube, and sterilize. Agar melts 
between 90 and 100 C. and remains fluid down to 40 C. 

Glycerin Agar. Add 6 per cent of glycerin after 
filtration ; tube, and sterilize. 

Glucose and Lactose Agar. To agar made with sugar- 
free broth, add 2 per cent of glucose or lactose. If to be 
tinted with neutral red, add before filtration 2 per cent of 
a solution of neutral red (| per cent). 

Litmus Lactose A gar. Add to nutrient agar prepared 
from sugar-free broth i to 2 per cent of lactose, and 
sufficient litmus to give a good colour (about 5 to 10 c.c. 
of a i per cent litmus solution per 100 c.c. of total medium). 
Conradi and Drigalski's medium is similar, plus nutrose 
and crystal- violet. 

Peptone Water. Dissolve by the aid of heat i per 
cent of peptones and per cent of NaCl in distilled water. 
Tube, and sterilize. For water investigations it is usual 
to keep a stock solution ten times this strength. 

Glucose, lactose, sucrose, and mannite are used with 
peptone water plus Durham's fermentation tubes. Mostly 
in i per cent strength. 

MacConkey's Media are much used in water examina- 
tions in this country. 

Bile-salt Litmus Glucose Peptone Water is made in single 
strength, and in triple strength thus : Peptone, 20 or 
60 grm. ; glucose, 5 or 15 grm. ; taurocholate of sodium, 
5 or 15 grm. ; litmus solution (10 per cent sterile) 100 c.c., 
and water to i litre. Put peptone, glucose, bile-salt, 
and water in a flask and heat in steamer for 45 minutes. 
Filter through Chardin's paper, add the filtered litmus 



154 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

solution, place in tubes, and put in Durham's fermentation 
tubes. Steam for 45 minutes on two successive days. 
Double strength is also used. In tubing put 10 c.c. 
of single strength, 10 c.c. of double, and 50 c.c. of triple, 
into suitable tubes. To these are added respectively I c.c., 
10 c.c., and 100 c.c. of the water sample. 

Bile-salt Neutral-red Lactose A gar is composed of agar 
20 grm., peptones 20 grm., lactose 10 grm., bile-salt 
5 grm., neutral-red aqueous sterile solution (i per cent) 
4 c.c., and water to I litre. Dissolve the agar, peptones 
and bile-salt in 500 c.c. of water by heating in the steamer 
for 90 minutes. Add rest of water, cool to 60 C., add the 
white of one egg, heat in steamer for 45 minutes, filter 
through a moistened Chardin filter-paper in a warm filter- 
jacket, heat filtrate in steamer for 15 minutes, add lactose 
and neutral red, put in tubes, and steam for 30 minutes 
on two successive days. The medium requires no alkali. 

Other Media. 

Milk. Fresh milk free from preservatives, with the 
cream removed, and giving an amphoteric reaction to 
litmus, is poured into tubes and heated in the steamer for 
three successive days at 100 C. (Above 110 C. browns 
it.) To prove sterility, incubate for at least three days at 
37 C. before using. 

Litmus Milk. Add sufficient litmus to colour. 

Potato. Scrub and wash a potato ; bore a cylinder- 
shaped piece ; split it diagonally and put each half into a 
sterile tube, with a pad of wool at the bottom, and half an 
inch of aq. dest. Plug, and sterilize at 100 C. on three days. 

Blood Serum. Collect blood in a sterile cylinder and 
allow to clot. Set aside for twenty-four hours in an ice 
chest. Pipette serum into tubes and place these in a 
sloping position in inspissator at 75 C. for one hour. 
Repeat on two successive days. When cool, incubate 
for twenty-four hours at 37 C., and if no growth, they may 
be considered sterile. 

Litmus Whey (Petruschky's). Mix milk with equal 
quantity of water, heat to 40 to 50 C., and add dilute 
HC1 to precipitate casein. Filter, neutralize with NaOH, 
and heat for one or two hours in steamer, filter till 



GENERAL PRINCIPLES 155 

clear j and if necessary neutralize again. Add sterile 
litmus until a violet hue is produced. Tube, and sterilize. 
A good medium for observing change of reaction. 

STERILIZATION AND DISINFECTION. 

1. Dry heat : 

(a) Bright red heat of flame : for platinum needles. 

(b) Dull red heat of flame : for knives, glass rods, 

etc. 

(c) Hot air : 170 C. for i hour : for glass-ware and 

cotton-wool. 

2. Moist heat : 

(a) Boiling in water at 100 C. : for 5 minutes kills 

all non-sporing forms: for i hours kills 
spores also. 

(b) Steam at 100 C. : Koch's steam sterilizer : i 

hours' full steaming, or 15 minutes' full 
steaming on three successive days : used for 
all media. 

(c) High-pressure steam : in autoclave: at 115 C., 

2 minutes for germs, 15 minutes for spores. 
Never used for gelatin media, or will not re- 
solidify. Never used for carbohydrate 
media, as decomposed into other sugars. 

3. Chemicals: 5 per cent carbolic, o-i per cent per- 

chloride of mercury, etc. Allow to remain in con- 
tact for half-an-hour. 

Discontinuous sterilization at 57-75 C. is used for 
media, like blood serum, that are changed at higher tem- 
peratures. The object is submitted to 60 minutes' heating, 
and kept at 20 to 37 C. until next day, when the heating 
is repeated, and the same procedure repeated for 3 to 8 
days. This is to cause spores present to assume the 
vegetative form and then to kill the same on re-heating. 

CULTURAL METHODS. 

1. Inoculation of liquid media, solid media, living media. 

2. Isolation of pure cultures by (a) serial inoculation ; 
(6) plate cultivation (serial dilution) ; (c) differential

CULTURAL REACTIONS. 

Inoculate various media and observe results from day 
to day on incubation at 20 or 37 C. (as directed). 
Label tubes with name of organism and date of inoculation, 
or mark with pencil. 



GENERAL PRINCIPLES 157 

Broth. Inoculate from agar cultures three broth tubes, 
one with each of the following bacilli : B. fluorescens 
liquefaciens, B. subtilis, and B. mycoides. Incubate at 
20 C. and examine in twenty-four or forty-eight hours. 
Culture of B. fluorescens liquefaciens, quite turbid, or 
" universal turbidity " ; of B. subtilis, quite clear but scum 
is formed ; of B. mycoides, quite clear but deposit is 
formed. 

Gelatin. Three forms of culture : (i) slant or streak, 
(2) stab, (3) shake. 

1. Slant or streak for non-liquefying organisms. 
Inoculate sloped tubes with B. coli communis and Torula 
alba. Incubate at 20 C. and examine after forty-eight 
hours. 

B. coli communis, spread over surface ; Torula alba, 
growth limited to line of inoculation. 

2. Stab culture to observe presence or absence of 
liquefaction. Inoculate gelatin tubes by stabbing with 
B. mycoides, B. megatherium, and Vibrio Finkler-Prior. 
Incubate at 20 C. and examine after twenty-four, forty- 
eight, and seventy-two hours. 

B. mycoides, horizontal liquefaction ; B. megatherium, 
funnel of liquefaction medium width ; V. Finkler-Prior, 
funnel of liquefaction wide. 

3. Shake culture to observe gas formation. Melt 
gelatin at 40 C. on water-bath and inoculate as in the 
case of broth. Place in rack, and allow to solidify. 
Incubate for forty-eight hours. Use B. coli communis and 
B. subtilis. 

B. coli communis, gelatin full of gas bubbles ; B. subtilis, 
no gas formed. 

Agar. Inoculate sloped agar tubes with the following 
germs, incubate at 37 C., and examine after twenty- 
four hours. 

Results should be as follows : B. subtilis, dry myco- 
derma ; B. mycoides, fine filaments ; B. megatherium, 
confluent moist raised growth ; B. proteus, thin transparent 
growth over whole surface. 

Potato. Inoculate, incubate at 37 C., and examine in 
twenty-four hours. 



158 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

B. subtilis, flesh-coloured mycoderma ; Streptococcus, 
invisible growth ; B. megatherium, a yellow, raised, moist 
growth. 

Blood Serum. Inoculate, and incubate at 37 C. for 
two to three days, and examine. 

B. coli communis, serum solid ; B. pyocyaneus, serum 
liquefied. 

Milk. Inoculate, incubate at 37 C. for forty-eight 
hours, and examine. 

B. coli communis, milk clotted and acid ; B. denitri- 
ficans, no clot, alkaline ; B. pyocyaneus, casein pre- 
cipitated and partly dissolved ; Streptococcus, no clot, 
slightly acid. 

MacConkey's Broth with Durham's tubes. Inoculate, 
incubate at 37 C., and examine daily. 

B. coli, acid and gas ; B. typhosus, acid, no gas. 

Peptone Water. Inoculate, incubate at 37 C., and 
examine in four or five days. 

B. coli communis, indol formed ; B. typhosus, none ; 
Sp. cholerae, nitroso-indol. 

Aerobic and Anaerobic. Make gelatin stabs and 
incubate at 20 C. for two days. 

B. zopfii, growth only on surface (strict aerobe). Torula 
alba, on surface and in depth (aerobe and facultative 
.anaerobe). B. butyricus, growth only in depth (strict 
anaerobe) . 

Colour Formation. 

1. Inoculate two agar tubes with B. prodigiosus, and 
incubate ; (i) at 37 C., (2) at 20 C. Examine in forty- 
eight hours, (i) is white or grey, (2) is pink. 

2. Presence of oxygen is necessary in most cases for 
pigment to be developed. Make two gelatin stab cultures 
of Bacillus fluorescens liquefaciens. Incubate one 

. aerobically and the other anaerobically. Examine in forty- 
eight hours. The aerobic culture is pigmented, the other 
is not. 

3. A few require absence of oxygen. Make gelatin 
stab of Spirillum rubrum and incubate at 20 C. for 3 to 4 
days, when growth is found in depth to be red and on 

surface to be white. 



GENERAL PRINCIPLES 159 

Colour Reduction is measured by the addition of some 
easily discoloured substance to the medium. Litmus, 
methylene-blue, and sodium sulphindigotate are used. As 
the bacteria grow, the colour is discharged in the anaerobic 
parts of the culture. In a fluid medium, shaking restores 
the colour. 

Proteinochrome formation is observed in 5 per cent 
peptone broth or 3 per cent peptone water. Add a few 
drops of acetic acid and then fresh chlorine water, when 
a red-violet colour indicates proteinochrome formation. 

Test for Indol Formation. To a pure culture in 
1 broth or peptone water add i c.c. of o-oi per cent sodium 
nitrite solution and i c.c. of purest sulphuric (25 per cent), 
or HC1. A red coloration within five minutes indicates 
that indol is present. A second test which gives a positive 
result with B. coli within forty-eight hours at 37 C. is to 
add i c.c. of an acid solution of paradimethylamido- 
benzaldehyde, when a rose or cherry-red colour develops 
in 2 or 3 minutes if indol is present. (Solution A. : para. 
8 grm., HC1 160 c.c., absolute alcohol 760 c.c. ; Solution 
B. : cold saturated solution of potassium sulphate. Use 
i c.c. of A, and shake, and add i c.c. of B. and allow to 
stand.) If there is any suspicion of the micro-organism 
having the power of reducing nitrates to nitrites, add the 
sulphuric acid first and wait ; if no coloration develops, 
then add the nitrite solution. 

Spirillum cholerae has this power, and hence the addition 
of the sulphuric acid is alone required. This is called 
the nitroso-indol reaction. 

LIQUEFACTION OF GELATIN. 

This is due to the development of enzymes from the 
growth of bacteria in proteid media. These proteolytic 
enzymes are not always secretions of the bacterial cell, 
but are in some cases closely bound to the cell-body, and 
are separable from it only after its death. When they are 
true secretory products, they can be separated from the 
micro-organisms by filtration through a Berkefeld filter 
candle, and from such filtrates they can be obtained in 



160 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

the dry state by precipitation with alcohol. Such enzymes 
are usually more thermostabile than when in solution. 
Thus, most enzymes are readily destroyed in solution at 
70 C., but dry enzymes may withstand 140 C. for 10 
minutes. (As usual, moist heat is more effective than 
dry heat.) 

This proteolytic (protein-splitting) or peptonizing power 
varies for the different proteids, and is usually tried on 
gelatin, blood fibrin, and casein of milk. Thus, Staphylo- 
coccus pyogenes liquefies gelatin and blood-serum, and 
clots milk, but does not dissolve the casein ; Streptococcus 
pyogenes does not liquefy gelatin, nor blood serum, nor 
casein ; B. coli communis is likewise negative to all three 
tests ; some varieties of B. proteus are positive to all 
three ; B. pyocyaneus is positive to the three ; Spirillum 
choleras liquefies gelatin and blood serum, but not casein ; 
and so on. These tests are still very useful in dividing 
the bacteria into groups, and so narrowing the field in the 
difficult task of concluding, with moderate certainty, the 
race of a particular germ.

NOTE. Organisms which do not grow on gelatin or at air temperature cannot 
be thus classified. 

HAEMOLYSIS. 

Haemolysis will be treated of under immunity, but the 
present reference is to the haemolytic action of certain 
organisms when grown on blood-agar plates. (Blood agar 
is made from defibrinated blood i part, and agar 2 parts.) 



GENERAL PRINCIPLES 161 

In such a medium, haemolysis (destruction of the red 
blood-cells) is shown by a yeUow transparent halo around 
the colonies. Organisms producing haemolysins, are : 
Staphylococci, Streptococci, some Spirilla (but not Sp. 
cholera) . 

STAINING REACTIONS AND METHODS. 

Saturated alcoholic solutions are kept as stock, and 
diluted i in 10 with water as required, and filtered. 
Rather use dilute stains and for a longer time, than have 
precipitate of stain on preparation. Stains can be reduced 
in intensity if necessary by using dilute acids, commonly 
acetic i per cent. Acid stains, like eosin, stain the proto- 
plasm of cells, whereas basic stains, like gentian-violet, 
methylene-blue, and fuchsin, stain the cell-nuclei and 
bacteria. 

Blood, pus, and smears from agar plates stain most 
sharply with methylene-blue, but stain fades rapidly on 
keeping. Certain bacteria need special stains. 

Loeffler's Methylene-blue. Saturated alcoholic solution 
methylene-blue 30 c.c. ; solution KOH (o-oi per cent) 
100 c.c. Keeps well. 

Aniline Oil-Water Stains. Made with saturated alco- 
holic solutions of gentian-violet and fuchsin, which are 
mixed i in 10 of aniline oil-water. The latter is a mixture, 
made by shaking 5 c.c. of aniline oil in 100 c.c. distilled 
water ; filter, and keep in dark. These keep badly. 

Carbol- fuchsin (Ziehl-Neelsen) . Ac. carbolic (5 per 
cent) 100 c.c. ; saturated alcoholic solution fuchsin 10 c.c. 
Diluted 3 to 4 times it stains more slowly but better. 
Keeps well. 

Carbol-glycerin-fuchsin. Fuchsin i grm., ac. carbolic 
liq. 5 c.c., glycerin 50 c.c., and aq. dest. 100 c.c. Dilute 
in use 4 to 10 times. Keeps well. 

Carbol-methylene-blue. Methylene-blue 1-5 grm., abso- 
lute alcohol 10 c.c., ac. carbolic (5 per cent) 100 c.c. 
Keeps well. 

To Make a Film. Take a cover-slip (in Cornet's for- 
ceps), and put on it a drop of distilled water (small for fear 
of plasmolysis) . Take two strokes of culture with platinum 
needle and rub into drop, and spread out. Dry in air

(should dry at once). Fix by passing three times through 
the flame. Stain for two or three minutes. Wash with 
water and examine on clean slide in water-drop (using oil 
immersion). In water-drop bacteria look larger, can be 
restained, and can be kept longer than when mounted 
direct in Canada balsam. To preserve : allow to dry, 
remove from slide, roll up, and label. 

Counterstain with eosin or other stain in dilute solution 
for I to 2 minutes. Eosin stains cell protoplasm red. 

Films are also made on slides, which are more easily 
handled than coverslips. 

Gram's Method of Staining Depends on the fact 
that some bacteria when well stained retain the stain after 
treatment with a solution of iodine and subsequent washing 
with alcohol (strong or absolute). This is believed to be 
due to the stain and the iodine forming a combination 
which resists decoloration.

and cover with Lugol's (or Gram's) solution of iodine 
(iodine i, KI 2, aq. dest. 300) for 30 seconds to 2 minutes. 
Wash with 97 per cent alcohol (or methylated spirit) until 
washings are no longer coloured (takes about 30 sec. to 
2 min.). Examine in water, or dry and mount in balsam. 
To counterstain : remove alcohol with water and cover 
with dilute carbol-fuchsin for a few seconds (or saturated 
watery solution of Bismarck brown for longer). Wash in 
water, dry, and mount. Result : Bacteria blue-black, or 
colourless, or red ; tissues red. Those bacteria which are 
blue-black are said to be Gram-staining or Gram-positive. 
The others are said to be Gram-negative. (See Table on 
previous page.) 

Acid-fast Bacteria. Some bacilli stain with difficulty 
with ordinary dyes, requiring the aid of heat or a mordant 
(as carbolic). Such bacilli usually retain the stain even 
when treated with dilute acids and alcohol, and hence are 
called " acid-proof " or " acid-fast." This resistance is 
believed to be due to the presence in the cell-body of a 
waxy substance (an alcohol). The members of this group 
are : Bacilli of human, bovine, avian, and fish tubercu- 
losis; Moeller's Timothy-grass bacilli (i) and (2) ; Mist- 
bacillus; Rabinowitch's butter bacillus; Korn's butter 
bacilli (2) and others ; Johne's bacillus (of chronic bovine 
pseudo-tuberculous enteritis) ; Bacillus smegmatis (smegma 
bacillus) ; Bacillus leprae (leprosy bacillus). 

METHOD. Flood slide or cover-glass with carbol-fuchsin 
and heat for 3 minutes. Wash and decolorize by dipping 
into 5 per cent sulphuric acid and 60 per cent alcohol alter- 
nately until film looks colourless. Wash in water. Counter- 
stain with aqueous methylene-blue for a half to one minute. 
W T ash and examine. The acid-fast bacteria are stained red, 
while the others and the matrix are stained blue. 

Alcohol-fast Bacteria. In specimens of urine being 
examined for tubercle bacilli, acid-fast smegma bacilli may 
also be present. To distinguish: counterstain film in a 
saturated solution of methylene-blue in absolute alcohol 
for 5 minutes. Tubercle bacilli remain red, while smegma 
bacilli become blue. 

Capsule Staining. Many bacteria possess a mucoid 
or gelatinous envelope, though it is only in a few species 



164 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

that it is easily demonstrable. It is known as the 
" capsule " and varies in thickness from being only just 
visible to 4 or 5 times the size of the bacterium itself. It 
is mostly seen in preparations taken directly from animal 
tissues or fluids or exudates, or from cultures in media 
containing animal serum or milk. It is best seen in the 
Diplococcus pneumoniae, Micrococcus tetragenus, B. 
aerogenes capsulatus, and the bacilli of the Friedlaender 
group. Hiss's method : Make a cover-slip film, and 
preferably by using a drop of animal serum instead of 
water. Dry in air and fix by heat. Stain for a few 
seconds with dilute fuchsin or gentian-violet (i of saturated 
alcoholic solution in 19 of aq. dest.), meanwhile heating 
the preparation over a flame until steam arises. Wash 
off dye with 20 per cent watery solution of copper 
sulphate. Blot dry (do not wash with water), and mount 
direct in Canada balsam. The capsule appears as a faint 
blue halo around a dark purple cell-body. 

Spore Staining. Prepare film as usual and fix in the 
flame. Place in CHC1 3 for two minutes. Wash in water. 
Place in 5 per cent chromic acid for half a minute to two 
minutes. Wash in water. Float cover-slip, film side down, 
on carbol-fuchsin solution in a small porcelain basin and 
heat stain gently until it steams ; continue in stain for 3 to 
5 minutes. Decolorize in 5 per cent sulphuric acid for 5 to 
10 seconds. Wash in water. Stain with saturated watery 
methylene-blue for 30 to 60 seconds. Wash and examine ; 
or dry, and mount in balsam. The spores are stained red 
and the cell bodies blue. 

Spores are believed to be an encysted or resting stage 
of bacteria, and not a method of reproduction, or rather 
multiplication. In most cases only one spore is produced 
by one bacillus, and the latter becomes extinct when the 
spore is fully developed. Spore formation is not very 
common among bacteria, and is found almost exclusively 
among the bacilli, less commonly in the spirilla, and rarely, 
if at all, in micrococci. The anaerobic bacilli are almost 
all spore-forming, but amongst aerobes the only sporing 
bacterium pathogenic to man is the anthrax bacillus. 
This materially facilitates and simplifies the disinfection 
and treatment of infectious diseases, as spores are extremely 



165 

resistant to injury by heat, light, drying, and chemicals. 
True spores or endospores are to be distinguished from 
arthrospores, the existence of which is now seriously 
questioned. An arthrospore is a bacterium which enters 
into a resting stage without any new formation within 
the protoplasm. It stains well with ordinary stains, and 
has no distinct capsule, but is stated to have increased 
resistance to external agents. A true spore (i) resists the 
ordinary staining method ; and (2) shows very great 
resistance to destruction to the usual agents. 

Flagella Staining. Flagella are hair-like organs 
used for locomotion, and have been described as occurring 
on bacilli, spirilla, and a few species of cocci. They are 
best seen in young cultures, 10 to 18 hours old, at 37 C. 
McCrorie's method gives admirable results when the 
technique is carefully followed. 

McCrorie's Flagella Stain. Measure out and mix : 
Night-blue, i grm. in 20 c.c. of absolute alcohol ; potash 
alum, i grm. in 20 c.c. of distilled water ; tannin, i grm. 
in 20 c.c. of distilled water. Allow mixture to stand for 
twenty-four hours, and filter supernatant fluid. Keep 
stain in incubator and filter again when using. 

METHOD. 

(1) Take some distilled water at 37 C. in a watch- 

glass ; place therein a loopful of young agar cul- 
ture, and allow to swim off and diffuse without 
stirring. 

(2) Take several loopfuls of this solution, and deposit 

them singly, without smearing, on a clean cover- 
slip. 

(3) Dry in the incubator at 37 C. 

(4) Apply stain (also at 37 C.) and replace in incubator 

for 10 minutes. 

(5) Wash off stain by dipping cover-slip edgeways 

several times into water at 37 C. 

(6) Dry in the incubator. 

(7) Mount : or counterstain bodies with strong fuchsin 

solution for 2 minutes ; wash, and dry as 
before ; mount. 
Flagella are blue, bacillary bodies are red. 



166 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Granules. Diphtheria bacilli when stained show oval 
bodies, which stain more deeply than the rest of the cell. 
Loeffler's methylene-blue (page 161) shows them well, but 
a contrast stain is often used, such as that of Neisser. 

Neisser's Method. Two solutions are used : Solution I : 
methylene-blue i grm. + 20 c.c. alcohol (96 per cent) + 
50 c.c. glacial acetic acid + 95 c.c. aq. Solution 2 : 
Bismarck-brown 2 grm. dissolved in I litre of boiling 
distilled water. Make a film, fix, stain with Solution i 
for 30 to 60 seconds. Wash, and pour on Solution 2, and 
after 30 seconds wash off with water. Dry, and mount. 
Bodies of the bacilli are brown, and the granules are blue. 

Paraffin-section Staining. Sections must first be 
fixed on slides by one of two modes : 

1. Float section on warm water (under 40 C.), insert 
slide underneath, with a needle fix one corner, and withdraw 
slide. Dry for 24 hours in incubator at 37 C. 

2. Place a drop of solution of egg-white (10 per cent in 
aq.) on a slide, draw on section as before, and incubate at 
37 C. for 30 minutes ; or, remove excess of moisture, heat 
over small flame until paraffin melts, and then until 
vapour arises. 

Staining. General Method. 

1. Preparation : Remove paraffin with xylol, and 

xylol with absolute alcohol. Wash in water 
(unless alcoholic solution of stain is used). 

2. Staining : Use methylene-blue for 15 minutes ; 

carbol-thionin-blue (5 minutes), or aniline-oil- 
gentian violet, carbol-fuchsin, etc. For over- 
staining reduce with very weak acid for 5 to 30 
seconds. This also decolorizes the tissues. 

3. Counter-staining : Wash in water, stain with J 

per cent eosin for 30 seconds, and wash in water. 

4. Dehydration and Clearing : Remove water with 

absolute alcohol (some organisms are decolorized 
very easily at this stage, and hence treatment 
must be rapid). Remove alcohol with xylol, 
and mount in Canada balsam. 

Weigert advises aniline oil, aniline-xylol, xylol, and 
balsam. 



GENERAL PRINCIPLES 167 

Gram's Method. (i) Prepare ; (2) Stain for 5 minutes 
with aniline-oil-gentian-violet ; (3) Pour off excess, do not 
wash, flood with Gram's iodine solution repeatedly, until 
purplish black, and allow to act for I minute ; (4) Do not 
wash, but decolorize with absolute alcohol or methylated 
spirit until faint violet tint ; (5) Wash in water, counter- 
stain with J per cent eosin for i minute ; (6) Dehydrate, 
clear, and mount. Bacteria are blue-black, and tissues 
are pink. 

In Weigert's modification of the Gram method, the 
section is first stained for 30 minutes in lithia-carmine. 
Wash in water and proceed as in Gram's method, except 
that the dehydration is done with aniline oil. 

Acid-fast Bacilli in sections. Tubercle bacilli, etc. 

(i) Prepare ; (2) Stain in carbol-fuchsin for 5 minutes in 
hot solution, or 24 hours in cold ; (3) Wash in water ; 
(4) Decolorize in 12 per cent sulphuric acid ; (5) Wash 
well in water (colour should just be a faint pink) ; (6) 
Contrast stain with saturated watery solution of methylene- 
blue for 30 seconds ; (7) Wash in water, dehydrate, clear, 
and mount. Bacilli are red, tissues are blue. 

Note. If a section has been hardened in corrosive 
sublimate, the latter must be removed after the paraffin. 
This is done by using equal parts of Gram's solution and 
water for a few minutes, and then removing the iodine 
with methylated spirit. 

POLYCHROME STAINS. 

These are of value for the staining of micro-organisms in 
pus and exudates, and for blood films, in all of which the 
relation of the bacteria or protozoa to the cellular elements 
is to be determined. In all these stains the basis is a 
mixture of solutions of methylene-blue and eosin, which 
stain the various elements separately and in combination, 
thus bringing out in a marvellous way the details of the 
structural and foreign bodies. This mixture is called the 
Romano wsky stain, and various modifications of it are 
now in use. 

Jenner's Stain. A simple stain, excellent for blood work, 
but not so good for parasites as others given below. No 



168 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

alkali is used in its preparation. Equal parts of watery 
solutions of (a) Gruebler's water-soluble eosin (1-2 per cent), 
and (b) Gruebler's medicinal methylene-blue (i per cent), 
are mixed, and the mixture allowed to stand for twenty- 
four hours. A coarse granular precipitate forms, is filtered 
off, dried at 55 C., washed with distilled water, filtered, 
washed again, filtered, and dried. Of the dried powder, 
0-5 grm. is dissolved in 100 c.c. of Merck's methyl alcohol. 
In use, a few drops are placed on the dried unfixed film for 
one to three minutes, then poured off, and the slide is 
washed with distilled water until pink in colour. Dry with 
filter-paper, and mount in xylol balsam. 

Leishman's Stain. The methylene-blue is alkalinized 
with 0-5 per cent of sodium carbonate, weaker eosin oolution 
is used, and the technique of preparation is varied. The 
stain will keep for a long period. In use, a few drops are 
placed on the unfixed preparation for fifteen to thirty 
seconds, the film being tilted from side to side to prevent 
drying at any part. In this way the film is both fixed (by 
the methyl alcohol) and stained by one operation. About 
twice as much distilled water is now added, and the diluted 
stain allowed to act for five minutes longer. Now wash 
in distilled water, mount, and examine. 

Giemsa's Stain and Method. This is a modified 
Romanowsky, of great value in staining Spirochaeta pallida, 
Vincent's spirilla, protozoa, and Negri bodies. The stain 
used is methyl-azure, which Giemsa believes to be the essen- 
tial constituent of the Romanowsky stain. In use, the film 
is first fixed with alcohol, dried, covered with the stain, dilu- 
ted, well washed, drained, dried, and mounted. For ordinary 
staining, fifteen minutes are enough ; for the spirochaete and 
Negri bodies, one to twelve hours may be necessary. 

Staining. By Romanowsky, red cells are stained 
orange to pink ; eosinophile granules, red ; neutrophile 
granules, yellow to lilac ; nuclei, shades of violet ; blood 
platelets, purplish ; malarial parasites, blue ; chromatin, 
red to rose-pink. 

Blood Films. May be made on cover-slips or on slides. 
With cover-slips, touch one to the exuding blood, drop 
it on another, and then draw the cover-slips apart. For 
slides, touch a drop of blood near one end of slide, and smear 



GENERAL PRINCIPLES 169 

out with another by drawing it slowly along the first, sloped 
to it at an angle of about 45. The slides used must be 
clean, and are usually stored in absolute alcohol, which 
is burnt off just when using. When the film is stained, 
it can be examined at once, with a drop of cedar oil, and 
afterwards mounted, if desired. 

Fixation is accomplished by methyl alcohol after air- 
drying, when using the Romanowsky method. For other 
processes it is attained by one of the following methods : 

(a). Half an hour in a hot-air chamber at 120 C. 

(b). Half an hour in a mixture of alcohol and ether 
(equal parts). Wash, and dry. 

(c). Five minutes in formol-alcohol (19). Wash, and 
dry (Gulland). 

(d). Two to three minutes in saturated solution of 
corrosive sublimate. Wash well, and dry. 

For wet films, which give the histology better, the methods 
are varied. The films, while still wet, are placed film 
downwards in the fixative. Gulland's combination of (b) 
and (d) is said to be an excellent one. 

INOCULATION OF ANIMALS. 

Inoculation of animals, or the animal experiment, as it 
is called, is used for a variety of purposes, is made in a 
variety of ways, and the number of different animals used 
is now considerable. It is an important way of getting a 
pure culture in difficult cases. It also determines 
the pathogenicity of a pure culture injected. By the 
occurrence of special symptoms following injection of 
suspected material, it serves to establish the presence of a 
particular micro-organism in the material. If the injection 
of known products of certain organisms is followed by 
certain reactions, the presence in the animal's body of 
the organism from which the product has been derived is 
inferred (tuberculin and maDein tests). By passing a par- 
ticular organism through a series of susceptible animals 
in succession, its virulence may be exalted, and the same 
experiment through resistant animals may depress its 
vitality ; this is Pasteur's " method of passage." Animal 
inoculation is also used for the production of anti- 
toxins and antibacterial bodies. 



170 



PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 



The inoculation may be : (i) Cutaneous, that is, rubbing 
into the unbroken skin ; (2) Subcutaneous, with a syringe, 
or by cutting the skin and putting the material in a pocket 
in the subcutaneous tissue and stitching up the skin wound ; 
(3) Intraperitoneal ; (4) Intramuscular ; (5) Intrapleural ; 
(6) Intravenous ; (7) Into the stomach by a tube, or by 
ordinary feeding ; and (8) By inhalation. 

The various processes are described as required under 
the particular microbes concerned. The average tempera- 
tures of the more commonly used animals and a few 
others may be here conveniently tabulated. The table 
is compiled from Abel's " Laboratory Handbook of 
Bacteriology," and from various other sources.

UNICELLULAR MICRO-ORGANISMS. 

Fungi. Fungi are members of the class of plants called 
Thallophyta, which show no division into root and stem. 
They are distinguished from the algae of the same class by 
not possessing chlorophyll. 



GENERAL PRINCIPLES 171 

Schizomycetes, or fission-fungi multiply by fission : 
coccus, bacillus, spirillum, streptothrix. 

Blastomycetes, or budding-fungi multiply by budding: 
the yeasts or torulae. 

Hyphomycetes, or branching-fungi multiply by branch- 
ing. The branches are called hyphae, and the network of 
interlacing threads is called the mycelium : the moulds. 

Protozoa. Unicellular members of the animal kingdom. 
They are divided into groups like the following : 

Sarcodina. Naked or cased organisms which throw out 
pseudopodia : amoeba. 

Flagellata. Endowed with organs of locomotion 
flagella : trypanosoma, spirochaeta. 

Infusoria. Locomotion by means of short flagella, 
called cilia, of which many are present : balantidium. 

Sporozoa. Non-motile in adult state. Reproduce by 
spores. Feed by osmosis. Exclusively endoparasites : 
plasmodium malariae or hsemosporidia, piroplasma, 
coccidium. 

Schizomycetes may be classed in various ways under 
the following heads : 

Parasites or Saprophytes 

Aerobes or Anaerobes 

The parasites, saprophytes, aerobes, and anaerobes may 
be either obligatory or facultative. 

Pathogenic or Non-pathogenic 

Sporing or Non-sporing 

Motile or Non-motile 

Flagellated or Non-flagellated 

Gelatin-liquefying or Non-liquefying 

Gram-staining or Non-Gram-staining 

Chromogenic or Non-chromogenic. 

Other characters used to distinguish bacteria into groups 
are : their action on the various sugars, the production of 
indol in certain media, reduction of nitrates, their behaviour 
to the dyes, e.g., acid-fast or not, polar staining, etc. 



CHAPTER X. 
RESULTS OF BACTERIAL ACTIVITY. 

PRODUCTS. 

THESE result mainly from the cleavage of proteids and 
fats, and the fermentation of carbohydrates. The basis 
of our knowledge on this subject was laid by Pasteur, who 
also was the first to prove the part played by micro- 
organisms in these processes. The actual work of cleavage 
is carried out by ferments or enzymes. A ferment or 
enzyme is a substance produced by a living cell, which 
substance is able to bring about enormous chemical change 
(in proportion to its bulk) without itself suffering 
decomposition. The accumulation of its products often 
causes its action to cease, but if these are removed, the 
action is indefinitely prolonged. We shall see that the 
toxins of bacteria have been compared to enzymes, and 
while to some extent there is a resemblance in their action, 
the toxins in a certain amount are able to produce only a 
definite result, which is less than that produced by a 
larger dose. 

The various enzymes are grouped as proteolytic (in 
culture, gelatin-, fibrin-, serum-liquefying), fat-splitting, 
and carbohydrate - splitting (produce alcohol, simpler 
sugars, lactic acid, butyric acid, acetic acid). 

Other activities are : denitrification, nitrification, light- 
production, colour-production, sulphur-utilization (sulphur 
bacteria), etc. 

Ptomaines. The action of bacteria on dead animal mat- 
ter by their proteolytic enzymes, produces substances called 
ptomaines, or " animal alkaloids." These bodies are toxic 
to the human species (and others), and are organic chemical 
compounds, basic in nature, which combine with acids to 
form salts. They have to be distinguished from leuco- 
maines, similar substances formed in the living body during 
proteid metabolism, and not by bacterial action. They 
have also to be distinguished from the bacterial toxins, 



BACTERIAL ACTIVITY 173 

\vhich are developed by bacterial growth, independent of 
the medium in which grown, and have even been obtained 
in cultures in proteid-free media. Of the ptomaines, 
putrescin and cadaverin are extremely poisonous, and most 
cases of meat-poisoning, cheese-poisoning, and vegetable- 
poisoning are due to one or another of these ptomaines. 

INFECTION. 

The invasion of the animal body by bacteria is spoken 
of as infection if it gives rise to disease. The definition 
requires extension to cover the case of diphtheria, where 
the invasion by the micro-organism is often very slight, 
but where the disease is due to the invasion of the body by 
the toxins or bacterial products. In most cases the 
infection is due to both the bacteria and their products, 
in varying degrees. 

In the first place it is useful to note that the skin and 
the mucous membranes of the alimentary tract, the mouth, 
the nasal passages, the upper respiratory tract, the con- 
junctive, and the genital passages, are normally inhabited 
by various species of bacteria. Some of these are 
facultative parasites, and seize the opportunity of a break 
in the surface, or other injury, to grow and multiply, and 
so produce disease. Others are pure saprophytes, non- 
pathogenic in any circumstances to the body on which 
they harbour. 

The definition of the infective diseases will be useful here. 

An infective disease, or rather a specific infective disease, 
is one which results from the introduction into the body, 
(i) by wounds, (2) by the air-passages, or (3) by the 
alimentary tract, of a definite ferment, or poison, or 
micro-organism, which grows and multiplies in the body. 

In some of these diseases the poison is given off again, 
and they are then spoken of as infectious, or transmissible 
from person to person. Where contact is necessary for 
transmission, they are called contagious. The tendency 
is to give up the use of these terms, infectious and con- 
tagious, and simply to speak of infective diseases, which 
are transmissible in various ways, as by the air, by food, 
by contact, by fomites, by insects. 



174 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

/ 

They are called specific, because they have a perfectly 
definite course, characterized by the stages of incubation, 
invasion, advance and death, or decline and convalescence. 
Some of them have also a skin eruption or rash. 

The infection is given off again by the breath, exhalations 
from the skin and wounds, by desquamated portions of 
the epidermis, by the secretions and excretions (mucus of 
mouth and throat, saliva, sputa, faeces, urine, seminal 
fluid, milk). 

Micro-organisms, then, are only relatively pathogenic or 
non-pathogenic, and in any particular instance of 
pathogenicity, the amount and kind of attack vary with 
a large number of factors. This is not a matter for wonder 
now, with our knowledge of the varied needs and differences 
in vitality of many micro-organisms, but was a stumbling- 
block in the early days. Following Muir and Ritchie, we 
may summarize the matter thus : 

Infection is conditioned by (i) the infecting agent, and 
(2) the subject. 

1. The infecting agent produces its effect dependent 

on (a) its virulence, (b) its numbers, (c) its path 
of entrance. 

2. The subject varies in its susceptibility or the 

reverse (resistance), according to (a) its species, 
(b) race, (c) age, (d) individual peculiarities, 
(e) vitality, (/) other disease. 

Mode of Action. Multiplication ; invasion of lymphatics ; 
invasion of blood-stream ; settlement in certain tissues ; 
chemical products (toxins), locally or diffused. 

Effects of Bacterial Action. 

1. Tissue changes : 

(a) Local tissue reactions or degeneration and 

necrosis, acute or chronic. 

(b) Distant damage to special tissues, reaction of 

blood-forming organs. 

(c). General malnutrition or increased waste, or 
both. 

2. Metabolic changes : fever, etc. 



BACTERIAL ACTIVITY 175 

BACTERIAL POISONS. 

The knowledge of these is by no means complete, so 
that sharp distinctions between various kinds cannot be, 
at present, depended on. The first to study their pro- 
duction was Brieger, and it was while so engaged that he 
was led to the discovery of the ptomaine poisons. These 
bodies, however, did not, on injection, reproduce the 
symptoms of diseases associated \vith the bacteria con- 
cerned in their production, and so the ptomaines are not 
nowadays classed as true bacterial poisons. Roux and 
Yersin, in 1889, filtered broth- cultures of B. diphtheriae 
through unglazed porcelain (Chamberland filter), and 
showed that the filtrate was bacteria free, and yet on 
injection the filtrate produced practically the same effects 
as the injection of the living bacilli. From this it was 
inferred that the filtrate contained the toxin of the 
diphtheria bacillus. The same method applied to other 
bacteria yielded no such result in most, and so the con- 
ception was reached that some bacteria secrete or excrete 
poisons which are soluble in the media in which they are 
grown, and some do not. Of the former class, diphtheria 
and tetanus are the types ; of the latter, the tubercle 
bacillus may be taken as a type, but the class is a very 
large one, including all the bacteria except diphtheria, 
tetanus, botulinus, and the anaerobes generally (some to 
only a small extent). Other bacteria, such as dysentery 
and cholera, are said to produce soluble poisons, but the 
results are still discordant. As a consequence of these 
findings, and of the further observation that, in the 
bacteria not secreting soluble poisons, the injection of 
dead bacteria could reproduce many of the characteristic 
lesions of the disease associated with them in the living 
state, the division of bacterial poisons into two groups 
has arisen, viz : 

1. Extracellular toxins, true toxins, or soluble toxins. 

2. Intracellular toxins, endotoxins. 

After the removal of these bodies from the bacteria, a 
certain proteid residue remains, which, on injection, gives 
rise to localized reactions. Buchner calls this residue 
" bacterial protein," and believes it to be the same in all 



176 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

bacteria, to be without specific toxic action, but having a 
positive chemiotactic action on the white cells of the blood, 
and so preparing the way for the formation of pus. It is 
still doubtful how much reliance can be placed on the 
total separation of the soluble and endotoxins from the 
bacterial protein, and until this doubt is resolved, these 
conclusions must be accepted with reserve. 

Extracellular Toxins. Of the extracellular or true 
or soluble toxins, that of B. diphtherias may be taken as 
the type. As a class they may be denned as the secretory 
products of the bacterial cells, passing out into the medium, 
and soluble therein. That the soluble toxins are only so 
produced has yet to be proved, and in the meantime they 
may be ascribed to the following sources, which may occur 
singly, or in any combination : 

1. Secretion or excretion from the bacterium. 

2. Action of the bacterium on the medium. 

3. Death of the bacterium and liberation of toxins 

from its disintegrated body. 

The soluble toxins are easily obtainable in large 
quantities, nevertheless they have not yet been isolated 
in a pure form, and so our knowledge of them is derived 
from the study of the complex filtrates in which they are 
found. Their action is characterized by being selective 
or specific for certain tissues ; for example, diphtheria, 
tetanus, and botulismus toxins all attack the nervous 
system. In the case of many of them, a definite time 
elapses before symptoms appear after injection. This 
has been called a period of incubation, though it is suscep- 
tible of other explanations. The extracellular toxins are 
apparently uncrystallizable, are soluble in water, are dia- 
lysable, are precipitated with proteids by absolute alcohol 
and by ammonium sulphate, are allied to albumoses, and 
are relatively unstable to heat, light, and chemicals. 

Intracellular Toxins. The endotoxins are either 
not excreted from the bodies of the bacilli, or are closely 
bound thereto, or are insoluble in the medium, and remain 
on filtration on the same side as the bacteria. Any of 
these theories would account for the known facts in regard 
to the endotoxins. The greater number of the pathogenic 
bacteria seem to act by poisons of this class. The poisons 



BACTERIAL ACTIVITY 177 

are liberated only after the death of the bacteria, by the 
breaking up of their bodies, and even then they cannot 
be obtained apart from the bacterial protoplasm. Their 
action has therefore been mostly studied by injection of 
the dead bodies of bacteria. The effects produced are 
not specific, but are more those of general disturbances 
of metabolism ; nor does much time elapse before the 
appearance of the symptoms, that is, there is no so-called 
incubation time. 

The intracellular toxins are less sensitive to heat than 
the soluble ones, but are mostly destroyed by heating to 
70 C. The notable exceptions to this are those of the 
tubercle bacillus, which are still toxic after digestion at 
100 C., and those of the B. enteritidis (Gaertner) which 
remain toxic after the infected flesh has been cooked. 

Some organisms, such as B. anthracis, possess no soluble 
toxin, nor does the injection of the dead bodies induce 
toxic effects. Yet in the disease produced by the living 
bacterium, symptoms which suggest toxin action are 
present. To meet such cases, the hypothesis has been 
made that these organisms only produce toxins in the 
animal tissues, or may produce complementary substances 
which assist the action of endotoxins. Such substances 
have been studied under the name of " aggressins." An 
animal is given a lethal dose of an organism, injected into 
a serous cavity, into which a serous exudation results. On 
the death of the animal, some of the exudate is taken, 
most of the bacteria are removed by centrifugalizing, and 
the few that remain by shaking up with toluol, and allowing 
to stand for some days. This fluid, on injection, is non- 
pathogenic, but has the power of increasing the effect 
of the particular bacterium which has caused its production, 
so that a non-lethal dose of the bacterium becomes a 
lethal one ; and not only so, but the fatal effect is more 
quickly produced. These results are ascribed to a 
paralysing action of the " aggressins " on the phagocytic 
functions of the leucocytes. Leucocidin, a true soluble 
toxin produced by some strains of staphylococcus, causes 
the death and partial solution of the leucocytes, and this 
would suggest that the aggressins might after all be toxins, 
either of the extra- or intra-cellular variety. 

12 



178 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Some bacteria give rise to both varieties, and it is now 
claimed that this is the case with cholera and dysentery 
organisms. 

Nature of Toxins. The nature of toxins is likewise 
ill understood. Sidney Martin found that the action of 
anthrax, diphtheria, tetanus, and ulcerative endocarditis 
organisms on albuminous bodies was to produce albumoses 
and peptones, thus resembling the gastric and pancreatic 
ferments. C. J. Martin, working at the same subject, 
found that the toxins could pass through a Chamberland 
filter, the pores of which had been filled with gelatin. 
From the fact that albumoses can also pass through, it 
is inferred that the toxins have a molecule of about the 
same size as the albumoses. Are the toxins of the nature 
of ferments ? Sidney Martin suggests that the primary 
toxic agents are of this nature, and by digesting the tissues 
produce albumoses, which cause the symptoms. The 
labile nature of the toxins is also urged as a point of 
resemblance between them and the ferments, as also the 
so-called period of incubation which follows their injection. 
If it is a fact that the action of a toxin is strictly propor- 
tional to its dose, comparison between toxins and the 
ferments is rendered unnecessary, as this is a fundamental 
difference ; the so-called resemblances are then mainly 
fortuitous. 

Allied Animal and Vegetable Poisons. Ricin, 
abrin, robin, and venins. Major Lamb calculates that 
0-015 g rm - (roughly, | grain) of cobra venom is a fatal 
dose for a man, which is large in comparison with the 
minimum lethal dose of tetanus toxin for man of 0-00023 
grm. (about ^J-^ grain). All these poisons resemble the 
soluble bacterial toxins, but are less easily dialysable, and 
hence have been called toxalbumins. The snake poisons 
are very complex bodies, containing one or more of 
several toxins, such as neurotoxins, cell toxins, haemolytic 
toxins, etc. 

Flexner and Noguchi discovered that the hsemolytic 
toxin of the cobra venom has no action by itself on the 
red cells, but requires the presence of normal serum. 
The latter is then said to contain a " complement " which 
" activates " the venom. Kyes and Sachs farther showed 



BACTERIAL ACTIVITY 179 

that lecithin (a highly complex fat found in the nervous 
system, and to a less extent in bile) has the property of 
activating the haemolytic substance in cobra venom. This 
is very important, since it points to a definite chemical 
combination, leading to the formation of a toxin from two 
non-toxic bodies, and is in line with the observed for- 
mation in diphtheria of an antitoxin, which has many of 
the characters of a chemical antidote. 



CHAPTER XI. 
IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS. 

Immunity, or resistance, may be denned as that power 
or function of the living organism, natural or acquired, 
which enables it to repel or prevent infection of itself by 
micro-organisms or their products. 

Anaphylaxis, or excessive susceptibility (hypersuscep- 
tibility, supersensitiveness), is denned as a state of 
extreme sensitiveness to the injection of certain substances, 
such as bacterial proteins, animal and vegetable albumins 
(blood serum, egg white, milk), brought about by one 
injection of the same substances or present from hereditary 
transmission. 

Both these terms are relative, in most instances. Thus, 
birds, while immune from tetanus toxin in any doses 
likely to result from natural infection, may be killed by 
enormous doses given experimentally. Similarly, in man, 
the immunity conferred by one attack of a disease like 
small-pox, may be overcome in special circumstances of 
dosage and environment. 

Absolute immunity does exist. Thus, so far, no animal 
has been infected with leprosy ; also, cold-blooded animals, 
under their normal conditions, are absolutely immune to 
the pathogenic bacteria of the warm-blooded animals. 
The wild carnivora have a very high degree of resistance 
to bacteria. 

Absolute anaphylaxis of a kind also occurs. Thus, the 
injection (subcutaneously) of 0-25 c.c. of the serum of an 
eel into a rabbit causes the death of the rabbit in a few 
minutes. Also the offspring of animals which have been 
themselves sensitized by injection, show a high degree of 
anaphylaxis from birth. (The strict use of the term 
" absolute " would require that the rabbit should die no 
matter how small the dose of serum used. Thus its use 
here is relative.) 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 181 

IMMUNITY. 

Immunity may be natural or acquired, and may be 
considered under the following heads: 

Natural Immunity. Depends on (a) individual, (b) race, 
and (c) species. 

Acquired Immunity. (A) By an attack of the specific 
disease ; (B) By active immunization with living bacteria, 
dead bacteria, or with toxins or filtrates ; (c) By passive 
immunization with antitoxic serum, or antibacterial serum. 

NATURAL IMMUNITY, or the resistance to bacteria con- 
ferred by nature, is a characteristic of the living organism, 
which varies with the individual, race, and species. Thus, 
individuals vary greatly in their resistance to infection 
from slight wounds, from polluted water and milk, and 
from micro-organisms generally. The young animal is 
usually less resistant than the mature of the same kind. 
As regards race, negroes are noted for their high degree of 
resistance to yellow fever, and in a less degree to malaria, 
yet they quickly sicken and succumb to small-pox and 
measles. Among animals, the Algerian sheep are more 
highly resistant to anthrax than the European races. 
The influence of species is seen in the non-liability of the 
human to certain animal diseases, such as cattle plague, 
fowl cholera, and swine erysipelas, whilst animals are 
equally resistant to such human infections as cholera, 
influenza, measles, etc. 

The causes of natural immunity are usually given as : 

(1) The action of certain leucocytes and other cells in 

engulfing and destroying the bacterial invaders, 
called phagocytosis, and 

(2) The action of the blood serum. 

i. Phagocytosis. Metchnikoff in 1884 advanced the 
theory of phagocytosis, based on a careful study of the 
subject, and since confirmed by many observers. The 
phagocytes are in part wandering cells, and in part fixed 
tissue cells. The chief wandering cells are the poly- 
morphonuclear and large mononuclear leucocytes and 
wandering tissue cells. Of the fixed phagocytes, possessing 
the power of amoeboid movement, the cells lining the serous 
and lymph spaces, the cells of the spleen pulp, and bone 



182 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY . 

marrow, are the chief examples. Metchnikoff calls the poly- 
morphonuclear leucocytes, Microphages, and all the other 
phagocytes, Macrophages. He observed the phagocytosis 
in a fungus disease of a water-flea (Daphnia), and in frogs 
infected with anthrax, where the death and dissolution of 
the bacilli could be seen going on inside the phagocytes. 
Later researches proved that the same phenomena could 
be observed in all infective processes, more especially if 
the animal were resistant to the infection. When the 
micro-organisms get into a part where few phagocytes 
are, a migration towards the affected spot occurs. This 
is part of the inflammatory reaction which follows infection. 
The cause of this migration is the presence of substances 
in the part, which attract the phagocytes, and is known 
as positive chemiotaxis. Negative chemiotaxis, or the 
repulsion of the phagocytes, also occurs. Buchner showed 
that dead bacteria, bacterial proteins, and closely allied 
substances, such as vegetable casein (legumin), have a 
positive Chemiotaxis, whilst the toxins of many virulent 
bacteria have a negative chemiotactic power. In natural 
immunity, phagocytosis is developed to a high degree, 
and it is of such constant and regular occurrence that 
we may often foretell from the degree of phagocytosis 
whether, in a particular infection, the animal being 
experimented with will gain the victory or not. A clinical 
application of these results is seen in the observation of 
the increase of the number of leucocytes in the blood 
during the progress of a disease like pneumonia. The 
increase is called " Leucocytosis," and is almost wholly 
of the polymorphonuclear variety. In pneumonia an early 
and marked leucocytosis is a sign of favourable import, 
and may be from 12,000 to 40,000 per c.mm. The absence 
of leucocytosis, except in very slight infections, is highly 
unfavourable. (It is interesting to note here that whoop- 
ing-cough gives a Lymphocytosis, as also do enlarged 
tonsils, rickets, scurvy, and a few other diseases.) 

2. The Action of the Blood Serum. Besides the 
direct action of the phagocytes, as described by Metchnikoff 
(the cellular theory), the blood seium was found to have 
bactericidal power. Von Fodor showed that freshly 
drawn rabbit's blood could destroy anthrax bacilli, as 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 183 

also could defibrinated blood, the pericardial fluid and 
the aqueous humour, and that this power was lost by 
heating to 55 C. Buchner (with others) found that 
completely cell-free blood was bactericidal, and lost this 
power on heating to 55 C., but not on freezing and 
thawing. According to Buchner, fresh blood frozen and 
thawed loses its power because the red cells are destroyed 
by the process, and make the blood so suitable for 
bacteria that the bactericidal power is compensated for. 
These protective substances in the serum are called 
" Cytases " by Metchnikoff, and "Alexines " by Buchner. 
These are now believed to be derived from the leucocytes, 
Metchnikoff holding that they are only formed on the 
death of the leucocytes, or rather phagocytes (" phago- 
lysis"), and that they do not exist in the body except 
under abnormal conditions. In any case when present they 
will probably prepare the bacteria for ingestion by the 
phagocytes, and thus are related to, if not identical with 
the " Opsonins " (feast-preparers). The cytases or alex- 
ines are of proteid nature and are very unstable. The 
withdrawal of the salts from the serum by dialysis sus- 
pends their activity, which is restored on again adding 
them. This fact is evidently related to the lessened 
amount of chlorides excreted in the urine in all acute 
febrile processes, and especially in lobar pneumonia. 
The cytases or alexines may be regarded as an appliance 
common to every animal organism, for the dissolution of 
organized substances, whether bacteria, foreign red 
corpuscles, or other foreign bodies. They are the 
" Complements" of Ehrlich's classification. 

ACQUIRED IMMUNITY. The immunity that is called 
natural is of a general kind, being a natural resistance to 
disease or bacteria of all kinds. That type of immunity 
called acquired, is, on the other hand, " specific " in kind, 
that is, an immunity from a definite or specific disease or 
infection. For this reason it is by some called specific 
immunity. 

(A). Acquired by an attack of a Specific Disease. The 
fact that an attack of small-pox followed by recovery 
protected the individual from further attack, was a notable 
one dunng the epidemic prevalence of that disease. Similar 



184 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

protection was seen in regard to other eruptive and 
non-eruptive fevers such as scarlatina, measles, typhus, 
typhoid, and whooping-cough. On the contrary, some 
specific diseases do not protect, but one attack seems to 
render the individual more liable to another. Such are 
diphtheria, pneumonia, influenza, gonorrhoea, erysipelas, 
relapsing fever, and rheumatic fever. In all of these it is 
probable that some degree of immunity results, but is of 
very short duration, as has been definitely observed in 
cholera and some other diseases. In all cases, however 
short the immunity, it is absolutely specific against a 
certain infective agent or its poison, and is not due to a 
general increase of resistance. In fact the reduction of 
the general resistance following the specific infection is 
such as in some cases to predispose to other infections. 
Thus, tuberculosis not infrequently follows a severe 
attack of measles, whooping-cough, or typhoid. Recovery 
from an acute infective disease is due to a process of 
immunization going on during the progress of the disease, 
which at a certain point or stage is able to prevent the 
further action of the infecting agent. The substances 
formed do not always exterminate the virus from the 
mucous surfaces ; and this is seen specially in typhoid 
fever, where the recovered patient may continue to excrete 
the living virus by the bowel or urinary discharges, and 
in diphtheria, where the virus may persist in the throat. 

Artificial Immunity. Under this head may be classed 
together forms (B) and (c) of acquired immunity. 

(B). By Active Immunization, or Protective Inoculation 
where the specific protective substances have to be formed 
in the body itself, as opposed to immunization by trans- 
ference of protective substances formed by active 
immunization in another animal, and called passive 
immunization. In active immunization, the individual or 
animal must undergo an infection followed by a reaction. 
By this means the protective substances are formed, and 
so the immunity is obtained only after the lapse of a period 
of time, when the immunizing apparatus of the organism 
is able to produce the protective substances in sufficient 
amount. The immunity thus evoked is of a more 
persistent type than that obtained by simply transferring 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 185 

the protective substances from an immunized animal, 
because, in the first case, an immunizing apparatus has 
been set up which is able to produce an (apparently) 
indefinite amount of protective substances and over a 
long period, whereas in the second case, a definite amount 
of the protective substances is injected, and when this 
amount is used up the protection is at an end. In active 
immunization, we must distinguish a " specific immunity 
to bacteria," and a " specific immunity to their toxins," 
just as we have a natural resistance or immunity to 
bacteria, which is different from the natural resistance or 
immunity to certain poisons. Thus the immunity after 
diphtheria is mainly to the toxins (antitoxic). On the 
other hand, the immunity purchased by the injection of 
cholera vibrios, is merely to the bacteria and not to their 
endotoxins. Hence the injection of cholera spirilla into an 
animal previously immunized to the same, is followed by 
the death and dissolution of the spirilla, but if the dose is 
large enough, also by a fatal intoxication of the animal 
by the cell poisons thus suddenly set free. This is the chief 
cause of failure of immunization to those bacteria which 
do not act (as diphtheria and tetanus do) through soluble 
toxins, diffused into the blood stream. The immunization 
would require, in such cases, to be of a double nature, 
namely, antibacterial and antitoxic. Apparently, as 
usually induced, the former mainly, if not entirely, results. 
The methods of active immunization are based on the 
work and discoveries of Pasteur and his associates, and 
may be summarized thus : 

(1) With living bacteria, virulent or attenuated. 

(2) With dead bacteria. 

(3) With the bacterial cell substances. 

(4) With soluble toxins or filtrates. 

(5) By feeding with toxic substances. 

i. With Living Bacteria or Virus, Virulent or Attenuated. 
(a). With virulent virus. Though the virus of small-pox 
is still unknown with certainty, inoculation of the small- 
pox, as introduced into England in 1718 by Lady Mary 
Wortley Montagu (see her " Letters "), may be given as an 
example. The inoculated disease was usually mild in type, 



186 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

but at times was severe and even fatal. In contagious 
pleuro-pneumonia of cattle, subcutaneous injection of the 
lymph of a newly killed animal, into the tail, has proved 
protective. The animal sometimes loses its tail in part, 
the brunt of the infection apparently remaining localized. 

(6). With attenuated virus. This is accomplished in 
one or more of the following ways : 

By cultivation of the organism in oxygen or a current of 
air, as first discovered by Pasteur in the case of the bacilli 
of chicken cholera. The attenuated bacilli, on injection, 
produced a non-fatal disease, which immunized the fowl, 
especially on repetition. 

By cultivation of the bacteria at high temperatures, 
e.g., anthrax bacilli at 42 to 43 C. 

By passage through a less susceptible species. This is 
the presently accepted explanation of vaccination for 
small-pox. Used by Pasteur for swine erysipelas, the 
bacillus of which is lessened in virulence by repeated 
passage through rabbits, but increased by passage through 
pigeons. Two inoculations were given, the first of the 
attenuated bacilli from rabbits, the second of the exalted 
bacilli from pigeons. 

By drying the virus, as in hydrophobia, where Pasteur 
found that the virus was exalted in virulence by successive 
subdural passage through rabbits, but diminished by 
passage through apes. He tried the immunization of dogs 
by the use of the diminished and increased viruses, but 
the results were too variable, so he tried drying the spinal 
cord of a rabbit dead of the disease. A cord thus dried at 
22 C. over KOH (to absorb CO 2 ) for i to 4 days, still 
causes rabies in 7 days (the incubation period shortened 
from 14 days by the exaltation of the virus) ; but if kept 
longer, the incubation period is prolonged, until one kept 
12 to 14 days has become inactive. The treatment 
consists in beginning with injection of an emulsion of this 
cord, and daily repeating with an emulsion of a less dried 
cord until within 15 days in mild cases and 21 days in 
severe, the strength arrived at is a 3-day-dried cord. 
Complete immunity thus takes 3 to 4 weeks, and so in 
cases coming under treatment at a late period, the 
method is condensed. Hoegyes uses fresh cord emulsified 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 187 

in salt solution, of which dilutions are made, and injections 
made in reverse order of dilutions. Fewer accompanying 
symptoms (as erythema at the point of injection, backache, 
muscular pains, and occasionally temporary paralysis) 
are noted, and this result is attributed to the less amount 
of nerve tissue injected. 

By cultivation in a medium containing antiseptics in 
a dilute state ; e.g., in presence of carbolic acid 1-600, or 
potassium bichromate 1-5000, or sulphuric acid 1-200. 

By addition of weak antiseptic solutions to virulent 
broth-cultures preparatory to their injection, as advised 
by Behring for immunization of horses to diphtheria and 
tetanus. The antiseptic advised is iodine terchloride, 
IC1 3 , in strengths varying from 0*05 per cent to 0-4 per- 
cent. Lugol's solution of iodine is also used. 

2. With Dead Bacteria. This method is simpler and 
safer, and in many cases confers the same degree of 
immunity, which is chiefly antibacterial. It is also 
used preliminarily to injection of living cultures, in the 
active immunization of animals. In the human being, 
it is used for cholera, plague, typhoid, and in the treat- 
ment by " vaccines " generally, as for staphylococcus 
infection, etc. 

3. With Bacterial Cell Substances. This method is a 
modification of that with dead bacteria. Instead of 
injecting the culture heated to 65 C., or some such tempera- 
ture, to kill the bacteria, the culture is subjected to various 
processes as in the preparation of Koch's original tuberculin. 
This is not purely bacterial cell substances, but is inter- 
mediate between the simply heated culture and tuberculin- 
R, which is an emulsion of the bodies of bacilli from which 
all the soluble substances have been extracted by grinding 
and treatment with distilled water (tuberculin-O). Hahn. 
following Buchner, has used mechanical pulverization of 
bacilli mixed with infusorial earth and quartz sand, and 
subjected to 300 to 500 atmospheres' pressure by hydraulic 
means, and has so obtained what he caUs the cell-juices 
or bacterial plasmins, which he has used for immunization. 
'' Cholera plasmin " and " typhoid plasmin " have both 
proved effective jn immunizing guinea-pigs against intra- 
peritoneal infection with ten times the fatal dose of virulent 



188 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

bacteria. " Tuberculo-plasmin " after filtration is a clear 
pale yellow fluid, containing nucleo-albumin, which keeps 
indefinitely on addition of 20 per cent of glycerin and 
5 per cent of NaCl. This preparation has been used with 
favourable results in guinea-pig tuberculosis. 

The reaction which follows the injection of a dead 
culture (local pain and swelling, rigor, depression, and 
anorexia) is not peculiar to any one bacterium, but 
follows upon the subcutaneous injection of all bacterial 
emulsions, and even of innocuous and living bacteria 
(Buchner, 1890). 

4. With Soluble Toxins or Filtrates. This method was 
first successfully used by Salmon and Smith, who showed 
that pigeons could be rendered immune to hog cholera 
by treatment \vith filtrates of hog-cholera bacilli (1886). 
It is now used for the immunization of horses to diphtheria 
and tetanus toxins, the immunity being afterwards 
heightened by the injection of virulent cultures, if Behring's 
advice is adopted. This use followed on the observations 
of Roux and Yersin, who showed in 1886, as a " result 
of splendid research " (Buchner) that the poison of 
diphtheria is extremely susceptible to heat (being destroyed 
at 65 C.), and is carried down mechanically by chemical 
precipitates such as calcium phosphates, properties which 
until then had been recognized mainly in the digestive 
ferments or enzymes. Brieger and Fraenkel confirmed 
these results, and showed that the poisons or toxins of 
diphtheria and tetanus can be obtained in a moderately 
pure form by precipitation \\ith absolute alcohol. These 
poisons gave the reactions of albuminous substances, 
and were hence at first called " toxalbumins." As they 
are now believed to be non-proteid, the name " specific 
toxins " is to be preferred. A specific toxin is one which, 
on injection, causes all the symptoms of the infection in 
question. 

5. Active Immunization by Feeding has been successfully 
used by Ehrlich for the poisons ricin and abrin, and with 
less success by Fraser against snake venom. In bacterial 
infections it has proved, so far, tedious, and the immuni- 
zation slight in amount. 

(c). By Passive Immunization. Behring in 1890 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHFLAXIS 189 

discovered that the blood serum of an animal actively 
immunized against diphtheria, when injected into another 
animal, is capable of rendering the latter insusceptible to 
what would otherwise be a fatal dose of diphtheria toxin. 
That is, the serum was able to destroy the diphtheria 
poison. In conjunction with Kitasato he afterwards proved 
the same for the tetanus toxin. The transference of the 
immune serum, in both cases, protects against the specific 
poison, and so allows the natural resistance of the body 
to overcome the bacilli. As the new animal body has 
thus supplied to it an antidote to the microbic toxins 
which have been shown to produce the symptoms of the 
disease, no reaction to these toxins occurs (where they 
have been completely and early destroyed), and so no 
active immunization occurs. The immunity conferred is, 
therefore, of a transient nature, and lasts only as long as 
some of the immune body in excess persists in the blood. 
Any such excess is destroyed or excreted within eight to 
fourteen days, and so the immunity may be expected to 
be absent thereafter. These remarks apply to " antitoxic 
sera," like those obtained in diphtheria and tetanus. The 
other form of passive immunization by " antibacterial " 
or " antimicrobic " sera, has proved unsatisfactory in use, 
for the reasons given on page 185. The action of the latter 
sera is not so simple as that of antitoxic sera, but is due 
to one or more of the following factors : (i) Bactericidal 
or lysogenic action, that is, death or solution of the micro- 
organisms ; (2) Opsonic action, or the rendering the 
bacteria more susceptible to the phagocytic action of the 
leucocytes ; (3) Agglutinative and precipitative actions, 
that is, clumping of the bacteria, or precipitation of their 
soluble products. 

Antitoxic Sera. The actual mode of manufacture 
may be conveniently given here. Diphtheria antitoxin 
may be taken as the type. A culture of B. diphtheriae in 
meat-infusion broth (containing i to 2 per cent of added 
peptones, and after being made neutral to litmus, having 
7 c.c. of N /i NaOH added per litre) is incubated for three 
weeks at 37 C. A strongly toxic fluid is thus produced, 
which is filtered through a Chamberland candle into a sterile 
flask, care being taken to avoid exposure to bright light. 



190 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

At the first attempts at immunization, the animals died 
of chronic poisoning. To avoid this, it is now usual to 
begin with very small doses of the toxin weakened by the 
addition of iodine terchloride or Lugol's solution (used in 
Gram's method of staining, I in KI in water). A young 
vigorous healthy horse (4 to 6 years old) is chosen, and 
0*5 c.c. of toxin mixed with an equal quantity of Lugol's 
solution is injectedsubcutaneouslyin front of the shoulder- 
blade, using a large needle connected with a syringe by a 
piece of rubber tubing. (The skin is previously shaved 
and sterilized.) After the reaction has subsided, usually 
in 5 to 8 days, a few days' interval is given, and the next 
dose is administered, either I c.c. + I c.c. Lugol's solution 
or 0-5 c.c. pure toxin. The amount given is thus gradually 
increased by c.c. until finally in three to four months 
the antitoxic value of the animal's serum is such that a 
dose of 300 c.c. of active toxin may be borne. The 
immunizing process must not be pushed too rapidly, other- 
wise the health of the animal will suffer. Serum is then 
obtained by inserting a sterile needle into the jugular vein 
of the horse, and collecting the quantity of blood desired 
(up to 6 litres at a time) through a rubber tube into sterile 
Erlenmeyer flasks containing solution of citrate of soda. 
These are allowed to stand until the corpuscles settle, and 
the plasma is poured off into another flask, and allowed 
to clot. Separate the serum, and filter. If filtered at 
once, it is found to precipitate again on standing, hence 
it is better to allow it to stand a few days before filtration. 
Bottle or tube, after adding 0-5 per cent carbolic, but 
before this it should be standardized. 

Standardization of antitoxic serum is very important, 
so that accurate dosage may be determined, and also so 
that one strength may be aimed at, since in the making 
it is liable to variation. The making of such a standard is 
not an easy task, because no two samples of toxin are of 
exactly the same strength, nor are even two samples of the 
same toxin tested at different times. This" is another way 
of saying that toxin is a very variable substance, but 
fortunately antitoxin is not so variable. Hence Ehrlich 
chose as his " immunity unit," the amount of antitoxic 
serum which will neutralize 100 times the minimum lethal 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 191 

dose (M.L.D.) of toxin for one guinea-pig of 250 grm. weight 
and which kills it within 5 days ; the serum and toxin 
being mixed together and made up to 4 c.c. bulk, and 
injected subcutaneously, the animal survives the time- 
limit. A serum containing one such unit in i c.c. is 
called " normal serum " or " normal diphtheria antitoxin " 
(D.A.N.), while a serum i c.c. 1,000 M.L.D. is spoken of 
as ten times normal (D.A.N.) 10 , etc. One c.c. of the normal 
serum is said to contain one " immunization unit," Work- 
ing back from quantities of serum of known strength (anti- 
toxic) and preserved in a dried state in a vacuum and in 
a dark cool place, the potency of any toxin at hand can be 
determined, and against this latter, any newly prepared 
serum can be standardized. In this way a fairly uniform 
standard can be maintained. The usual antitoxic serum 
on the market contains 2000 " immunity units " or shortly, 
units in 4 to 5 c.c. of serum and equal to 200,000 M.L.D. 
High-potency sera are prepared so that 5 c.c. contain 5000 
units, and correspondingly. The serum keeps very well 
for at least one year in a cool dark place. The durability 
of the serum is tested by keeping back some of the bottles, 
and from time to time examining their activity, and if it is 
found to rapidly diminish, all the bottles bearing the same 
number are recalled. 

OTHER IMMUNITY PHENOMENA. 

Pfeiffer's Phenomenon. In 1894, Pfeiffer showed 
that when cholera spirilla are injected into the peritoneal 
cavity of cholera-immune guinea-pigs, the spirilla rapidly 
swell up, become granular, and often undergo complete 
solution. The same result could be observed in a normal 
animal, if a protective amount of cholera-immune serum 
were injected at the same time. The constituents of the 
blood serum which cause this result are spoken of as 
" Bacteriolysins." It was soon shown that the same 
result followed the mixing of the spirilla and the serum in a 
test tube under suitable conditions. The same phenomenon 
was thereafter observed for other micro-organisms. 

Agglutination. In 1896, Grueber and Durham, 
investigating Pfeiffer's phenomenon, found that when a 



192 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

quantity of immune serum is added to a broth culture of 
the respective bacterium, flake-like clumps sink to the 
bottom of the tube, and the supernatant liquid becomes 
clear. Grueber also showed that the immune serum 
would affect in the same way, though less powerfully, 
closely allied bacteria. The substances causing this are 
called " Agglutinins," and were thought to be the same as 
the " immune-body " concerned in Pfeiffer's reaction. 
Both are comparatively thermostabile, but the agglutinins 
cannot be reactivated by the subsequent addition of normal 
serum. They do not act if NaCl is absent. 

Precipitation. In 1897, Kraus showed that precipi- 
tates were formed when filtrates of cultures were mixed with 
the corresponding immune serum. The " Precipitins," 
like the agglutinins, are inactivated by heat (60 to 70 C.) 
and cannot be reactivated (see SERUM PRECIPITATION, 
below). 

Haemolysis. Bordet, in 1898, showed that the serum 
of an animal which has been repeatedly injected with the 
red corpuscles of another, acquires the power of dissolving 
the red cells of that other, and that this power is lost on 
heating to 55 C. but is regained by the addition of serum 
of a non-treated animal. Other " cytotoxins " (cell- 
destroying antibodies) similarly produced are : leucotoxin, 
nephrotoxin, spermatotoxin, hepatotoxin, pancreatoxin, 
suprarenal toxin, etc. 

Serum Precipitation. Like haemolysis, this subject 
is closely allied to the reactions induced by bacteria. 
When the serum of one animal is injected repeatedly into 
another animal of a different species, a substance forms in 
the first animal's serum, which causes, in a mixture of the 
two sera, a cloudiness or precipitate to form. This 
substance is called " precipitin," and is specific for each 
species, in high dilutions, as in the case of the other 
reactions. The precipitins, whether formed from bacterial 
or serum stimulation (or casein of milk, etc.), are all 
inactivated by heating to 60 to 70 C., but can not be 
reactivated by the addition of normal serum or any known 
method. Such inactivated serum, however, if mixed 
with a certain amount of active serum, is able to prevent 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 193 

the latter giving a precipitate. The precipitins are there- 
fore conceived to be built up of two atom groups, one 
thermolabile and the other thermostabile. Unlike 
agglutinins, they have not been, so far, shown to exist in 
normal serum. This reaction is used in forensic work, 
to determine the character of blood-stains, whether human 
or not. 

Opsonic Action. In 1903-4, Sir Almroth Wright 
undertook a systematic study of the phenomenon of 
phagocytosis, and showed that phagocytosis depended 
on a substance present in the serum, which acts on the 
bacteria (and not on the leucocytes), becomes fixed to 
them, and makes them a prey to the leucocytes. To this 
substance he gave the name " opsonin " (feast preparer). 
This substance is present in normal serum, but can be 
increased by immunization. It is destroyed by heating 
to 55 C. Leucocytes washed with salt solution have no 
phagocytic action. On the other hand, if the bacteria are 
exposed to the action of serum, and then washed free of it, 
they can be phagocytozed by the washed leucocytes. It is 
hence inferred that the opsonin becomes bound to the 
bacterium. A similar substance has been described in 
immune sera after heating (bacteriotropin), but it is 
specific for the corresponding bacterium, while the opsonin 
in normal serum is non-specific. There are thus two 
opsonic substances ; that present in normal serum, which is 
thermolabile, and that present in immune sera, which is 
thermostabile. In opsonic estimation, both factors are 
at work where the person is being gradually immunized 
to a particular bacterium. The whole question is still 
complex and full of difficulties, and requires further 
elucidation. 

TECHNIQUE OF OPSONIC ESTIMATION. The method of 
Leishman is very simple. Take a capillary pipette, fitted 
with a rubber nipple. Make a mark on the stem ; draw up 
fresh blood from the finger to the mark. Then draw up 
a little air to make an air-bubble, which separates the 
blood from the bacterial emulsion now drawn up to the 
same mark. The two fluids are then mixed by being 
blown out on a glass slide, and drawn back repeatedly. 
Finally, the drop is placed on the slide, covered with a 

13 



194 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

cover -slip, and incubated at 37 C. for 15 minutes. 
Thereafter a film is made and stained by Leishman's 
method, and the number of bacteria present in 50 poly- 
morphonuclear leucocytes is observed. This number 
divided by 50 gives the "opsonic index." Wright's 
method is more elaborate and specific. He uses (i) 
Leucocytes from the observer's blood repeatedly washed 
with saline solution (0-85 per cent) ; (2) Bacterial emulsion 
in salt solution ; (3) Serum from the blood to be tested, free 
of clot and cells. These are now mixed, as above, in equal 
amounts, in a capillary pipette, and the mixing is made 
thorough by blowing out and sucking in, for ten times. 
The mixture is then drawn into the tube of the pipette, 
the end sealed, the rubber nipple removed, and the tube 
put into the incubator for 15 minutes. The tube is then 
removed, the end broken off, the contents are again mixed, 
and films made, dried or fixed, and stained as desired 
(Jenner, Leishman, or Giemsa), and bacteria counted in 
50 to 100 cells. A control is done with normal serum, and 
the ''Opsonic Index" taken is the quotient of that got 
with the patient's serum divided by the index got with 
the normal serum. The latter, to minimize variation, 
may be made by mixing the serum of several healthy 
individuals. The number of bacteria per leucocyte 
(polymorphonuclear), in any one estimation, is also spoken 
of as the " Phagocytic Index," and the opsonic index is 
thus the proportion between the phagocytic index for the 
patient's serum and that for the normal serum. A 
modification of the method is to take a number of dilutions 
of the patient's serum and of the normal serum and to 
estimate in all these not the phagocytic index, but the 
percentage of leucocytes which act as phagocytes, i.e., 
the "Percentage Index," and the indices of the corres- 
ponding dilutions can be compared. The bacterial 
emulsion used is likewise thinner than in Wright's method. 
By the same process, the dilution of the serum at which 
phagocytosis is absent or very slight, can be determined. 
This is called the " Opsonic Coefficient of Extinction." 
Wright's Vaccine Therapy consists in injecting killed 
bacterial cells into the infected individual, in order to 
raise the phagocytic index to that particular cell. He 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 195 

began with chronic staphylococcal infections, and in such 
cases good results were obtained. The method has been 
applied to infections by tubercle bacilli, streptococci, 
gonococci, pneumococci, and other bacteria. If possible, 
a culture is made from the actual bacteria causing the 
infection. From the culture so made, an emulsion in 
sterile salt solution is obtained, and the emulsion sterilized 
at the lowest possible temperature (usually 65 C. for one 
hour), and an agar inoculation made from the presumably 
sterile emulsion, and incubated for twenty-four hours 
to see if really sterile. The bacterial content of the 
emulsion must be estimated, so as to be able to know how 
many are being injected, and to inject a definite quantity. 
This is done by mixing equal quantities of the emulsion 
(\vhole or diluted) and fresh blood, and making films, and 
staining. The number of bacteria to red cells is noted 
over a field made by drawing a circle with a blue pencil 
on the lens of the eye-piece of the microscope. The 
number of red cells in the blood being known (say 5 million 
per c.mm.), and the relative proportion of bacteria in 
undiluted emulsion to the red cells being, say, 700 to 400, 
then as 400 : 700 : : 5,000,000 : x = 8,750,000 bacteria per 
c.mm. If the emulsion had been diluted, then the result 
w-ould have to be multiplied by the number of the dilutions. 
It is preferred that the content be estimated before 
sterilization, as some of the bacteria may undergo 
disintegration during that process. Where the blood 
serum has an agglutinating effect, the red cells are separated 
and mixed with salt solution. It is better to render 
motile bacilli still by having a little formol in the saline 
solution. From the stock emulsion thus standardized 
and sterilized, appropriate doses are made by dilution 
with 0-5 per cent phenol or lysol solution, and put in glass 
bulbs, with capillary ends which are sealed. The ordinary 
dosage is to begin with 100 million and to repeat, if necessary 
using a larger dose, after estimating the opsonic index, and 
only if this is rising. Numerous observations after the 
injection of such vaccines have shown that the opsonic 
index falls for some time thereafter (" Negative Phase ") 
and then begins to rise, and usually ascends to a higher 
level than before. Another injection during the negative 



196 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

phase tends to accentuate it, while after the increasing or 
" Positive Phase " has begun, an injection causes it to 
reach a still higher level. The negative phase is usually 
completed in twenty-four hours, and the positive in three 
to four days. Wright recommends that the succeeding 
injection should be given when the positive phase has just 
reached its summit. In tuberculosis, Koch's bacillary 
emulsion is used, and the dose is minute, j^Vrr rn S r -> 
gradually increased to y^Vrr mgr. In vaccination against, 
and in, enteric fever, a standardized strain of Bacillus 
typhosus is used. 

Leucocyte Extract. The action of the leucocytes in 
phagocytosis, and of the alexines, which some believe to 
be derived from them, led Hiss to experiment with leuco- 
cytic extracts. These were obtained by the intrapleural 
injection of aleuronat, which produced a copious cellular 
exudate in 24 hours. The animal being used (a rabbit) is 
killed, and the exudate removed, with every precaution to 
ensure avoidance of contamination, and the cells are 
obtained by centrifugalization. The deposited cells are 
treated with sterile distilled water, and thoroughly beaten 
with a platinum spatula. Smears are made, stained by 
Jenner's method, and examined for bacterial contamination ; 
cultures are made to detect the same ; more sterile water 
is added, and the steps are repeated after incubating for 
8 hours. If no bacteria are found, the resulting fluid is put 
into the refrigerator until used. Such extracts of exudate 
cells, on intraperitoneal or subcutaneous injection, have 
markedly modified the course of infections in the rabbit 
and guinea-pig, prolonging life, and in some cases prevent- 
ing a fatal issue from an otherwise lethal dose. Beneficial 
effects have been observed in man in lobar pneumonia, 
erysipelas, and in staphylococcal infections. The action 
of the extract on the bacterial products or toxins seems 
to be a neutralizing or destroying one. The substances 
present in these extracts have been called " endolysins," 
and are different from the serum bacteriolysins, (i) in 
not being inactivated under 80 C. ; (2) when heated 
above 80 C. they are destroyed, and cannot be reactivated 
by the addition either of fresh serum or of unheated 
leucocyte extract. They are not increased by immuniza- 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 197 

tion, each leucocyte probably having a definite quantity 
within its substance. 

Aggressins. The great susceptibility of some species 
of animals to infection by certain bacteria, while their 
serum nevertheless possessed marked bactericidal power 
against these bacteria, suggested to Bail the theory that 
these bacteria secrete definite substances, which protect 
them against phagocytosis. Such substances he called 
" aggressins," and they are therefore antagonistic to the 
opsonins. They are probably not produced in test tube, 
or only to a slight degree. He based this theory on two 
observations, namely, that sub-lethal doses of bacteria, 
injected along with a small quantity of " aggressins" were 
rapidly fatal ; and that animals could be immunized against 
the corresponding bacteria by the injection of the aggressins. 
The aggressins were got, as detailed on page 177, in the 
exudate into a serous cavity of an animal killed by the 
injection of a dose of a particular bacterium into the serous 
cavity, and from which exudate the bacteria are carefully 
removed. This theory has been attacked on the ground 
that the aggressins are merely the bacterial toxins, probably 
endotoxins, liberated in the living body. The fact that 
such exudates are usually cellular, along with what has 
been said above of the action of leucocyte extract in some 
infections, tends to confirm this criticism. In fact, it may 
be put this way : When there is a high natural resistance 
to a bacterium, the alexines and opsonins are able to 
overpower it in all average infections and prepare it for 
phagocytosis and subsequent destruction. On the other 
hand, where the natural resistance is low, these agents do 
not succeed in preventing the growth of the bacterium, 
which in its growth elaborates various substances, some 
of which reduce the resistance still further, and so progres- 
sive infection results. If this infection is not too severe, 
the immunizing apparatus throughout the body, stimulated 
by the diluted toxins (extra- or intra-cellular) present in 
the blood stream, produces an excess of antibodies and 
anticells (phagocytes), and in this way may attain the 
objective of active immunization. If the infection is too 
acute, paralysis of the immunizing apparatus is the result.

THEORIES OF IMMUNITY. 

The rational explanation of all the phenomena of 
immunity which are known, is a task yet to be accomplished, 
It is perhaps better to have a working hypothesis only, 
as our ideas are being continually enlarged and modified. 
The many elaborate and complex experiments which have 
been performed and repeated by many observers are 
attended by so many consenting circumstances, of some 
of which we are totally ignorant, that it is not surprising 
that the inferences from the same experiment are so varied 
and even at times so conflicting. The words of Pasteur r 
used in another regard, seem quite appropriate here : 
" In experimental science, it is always a mistake not to 
doubt, when facts do not compel affirmation. ... In my 
opinion the question is whole and untouched by decisive 
proofs." 

Any theory must take account of phagocytosis, the 
bactericidal power of normal serum, the results of immun- 
ization as seen in. the formation of antitoxins, bacterio- 
lysins, agglutinins, precipitins, and opsonins, and any other 
phenomena which emerge in the further consideration oi 
these. When the theory is built around the phagocyte, 
it is called a " cellular " theory ; if the body fluids are 
taken as the key, a " humoral " theory. The final 
explanation will probably lie in a judicious blending of 
these two theories. 

Metchnikoff's Phagocytic Theory. In this theory 
immunization leads to a more rapid and greater leuco- 
cytosis in response to subsequent infection by the same 
agent. At the seat of invasion there is also emigration of 
the microphages from the blood-vessels into the tissues, 
or if in a serous cavity, the exodus is into the same, giving 
a cellular exudate. On examination of these cells, many 
of them are found (in bacterial infections) to contain 
bacteria in their substance. These are not simply dead 
bacteria, in process of removal, but living and virulent 
ones. At a later stage, the bacteria may be seen swollen, 
granular, and vacuolated, and finally disintegrated. On 
the other hand, the phagocyte may not be able to digest 
the engulfed bacteria, and may itself be killed ; and in that 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 199 

case, the leucocyte itself will disintegrate. The substance 
present in normal blood, which is bactericidal, Metchnikoff 
calls " Cytase," and he holds that it is secreted by the 
phagpcytes. The substance formed in immunization which, 
like the cytase, is bactericidal, he calls the " Fixateur," 
and also looks upon as a derivative of the leucocytes. He 
believes that these substances (at least, the cytase) are only 
set free in the blood-stream by the destruction of the 
phagocytes. The action of opsonins and leucocyte extract 
all tend to confirm the importance of phagocytosis, and 
the probability that these cells, retaining the characters of 
the amoeba, retain also its marvellous adaptability, which 
is not usually seen or expected of the fixed tissue cells, 
which are so very highly specialized as to function. 
Metchnikoff therefore believes that for every infection 
the leucocytes develop a power of resistance, which may be 
revived on any subsequent infection, and so protect to 
a greater or less degree. 

Ehrlich's Theory is more complex. The discovery 
of antitoxins led to explanations of their action. At first 
they were thought to destroy the toxin, but this simple 
explanation was set aside by the experiments of Calmette 
on snake poison, which is thermostabile up to 100 C. He 
noted that non-toxic mixtures of the toxin and antitoxin 
became toxic again on heating, the inference being that 
the toxin was bound or inactivated by the antitoxin, 
which is destroyed on heating above 60 C., and so the 
more stabile toxin is again left free. Further, C. J. Martin 
and Cherry demonstrated the close resemblance of the 
union to that of definite organic compounds, by an 
experiment in which they tried to pass toxin-antitoxin 
mixtures through a Chamberland bougie, the pores of 
which were filled with gelatin. In previous experiments 
they found that under 50 atmospheres of pressure, toxin 
passed through but antitoxin did not. In toxin-antitoxin 
mixtures, if filtered at once, all the toxin came through ; 
but after standing for variable periods, less came through 
the longer the time, until two hours after mixing, no toxin 
passed through the filter (or dialyser). Then Ehrlich 
showed, using ricin and antiricin, that definite quantitative 
proportions of the toxin and antitoxin entered into the 



200 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

reaction. The standardization of diphtheria toxin and 
antitoxin was the next step. Von Behring called a toxin 
containing 100 minimum lethal doses (for a 250 grm. guinea- 
pig) in i c.c., a "normal toxin solution" (D.T.N'.M' 250 ), 
and a serum capable of neutralizing it c.c. for c'.c., a 
" normal antitoxin " or an " antitoxin unit." 

Ehrlich, in working at the subject, more exactly 
measured the toxin unit by introducing a time-limit, 
namely, that one unit must kill the guinea-pig in 4 to 5 
days. He also varied von Behring's method of testing 
the antitoxin, by first mixing the toxin and antitoxin 
outside the body, and thereafter injecting ; whereas von 
Behring injected them separately and at different parts. 
He prepared in this way an antitoxin, which he kept in a 
stable condition by drying in a vacuum and preserving 
in the dark in a dry atmosphere and at a low temperature. 
With this antitoxin he is able to standardize new toxins, 
and from them new antitoxins. In the course of this 
work he made some discoveries. In the first place, while 
the death of a guinea-pig in 4 to 5 days gave a fair measure 
of i toxin unit, when 100 such units were mixed with the 
amount of antitoxin necessary to neutralize, namely, 
i antitoxin unit (which was determined from previous 
measurement), and injected into a guinea-pig, it was not 
easy to estimate whether there was exact neutralization, 
or less, or more. If the antitoxin were markedly insufficient 
to neutralize the toxin, then symptoms such as paralysis, 
etc., would arise which would proclaim this. But the 
conditions of the experiment were such that no marked 
signs could be expected. The further test, therefore, 
was devised, namely to find the amount of toxin which, 
plus i unit of antitoxin would still be able to kill a guinea- 
pig, on injection, in 4 to 5 days. (When a new serum is to . 
be standardized, the amount of serum which, mixed with 
this last-mentioned amount of toxin, just suffices to prevent 
the death of the guinea-pig before 4 days, is taken as one 
unit of antitoxin.) Theoretically one might have expected 
that, if i toxin unit killed a 250 grm. guinea-pig in 4 to 5 
days, and i antitoxin unit exactly neutralized 100 toxin 
units, the injection of i antitoxin unit mixed with 101 
toxin units would have left i toxin unit free to have killed 



201 

the guinea-pig in 4 to 5 days. Piactically this was not 
found to be so, but that a considerable excess of toxin 
units is required to kill the guinea-pig, (stated by Ehrlich 
to be 100 toxin units, and by others as intermediate 
amounts). On this basis Ehrlich has built a whole structure 
of epitoxoids, toxoids, prototoxoids, syntoxoids, and toxons, 
designed to explain on the laws of chemical equivalence 
and differences in chemical affinity, the apparent contra- 
diction of these results. It is right to point out, however, 
that the basis is not a chemical one. The death of a 
guinea-pig in 4 to 5 days cannot be compared, though it 
follows on an injection of toxin, to the appearance, more 
or less immediately, of a precipitate in a liquid to which 
some other chemical body has been added. Also, the 
relationship between the mixture of toxin and antitoxin 
which just causes no symptoms, and that mixture which 
kills a guinea-pig in 4 to 5 days, is an arbitrary one, and 
any apparent numerical relationship should be regarded as 
fortuitous until other evidence shows that it is more than 
that. Again, the admitted instability of the toxins, and 
probably of antitoxins, even under every precaution, 
renders the results equivocal. In brief, Ehrlich's theory 
is that antitoxin has a valency of 200 for toxin, and that 
some of the bonds of antitoxin can be satisfied by degenera- 
tion products of toxin, prototoxoids, deuterotoxoids, 
tritotoxins, of alpha and beta varieties, and by toxons, 
which are not derived from toxin but are present in 
the toxin fluid at first. [" Valency = 200 " cannot be 
accepted in the chemical sense. It only means that, 
starting with an amount of antitoxin which neutralized 
100 toxin units elsewise defined, it was found that when 
the conditions were changed, the antitoxin, in some way 
or other, neutralized 200 of these same toxin units, or in 
the experiment appeared to do so. If the amount of 
antitoxin used at first had been the amount required to 
neutralize i toxin unit (and von Behring advised the 
larger quantity only for safety), the amount found in the 
second experiment would have been 2 by inference. The 
mixture of the toxin and antitoxin before injection may be 
a factor of moment in regard to this change of valency.] 
Ehrlich calls the quantity of toxin which just neutralizes 



202 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

i antitoxin unit, " limes zero," expressed as L ; and 
the quantity required to neutralize i unit of antitoxin 
and yet, on injection, kill the guinea-pig in 4 to 5 days, 
" limes death, expressed as L +. Then, according to his 
theory, if T represent i toxin unit, 

L = lOOxT and L+ = L + ioixT = 201 xT. 

Ehrlich's side-chain theory is based on his previous 
researches on the oxygen requirements of the organism, 
linked up with those on diphtheria antitoxin. Borrowing 
the language of organic chemistry, he likens the highly 
complex albuminous and other molecules of animal 
nutrition, to those complex compounds of the aromatic 
series which chemists have dissected into a central group, 
in which the elements may be represented as a hexagon 
or ring of the benzene type, and the various other parts as 
side-processes or side-chains. Thus benzene has derivatives 
like the following, the added groups of which may be 
spoken of as side-chains.

Applying the same ideas to living cells, Ehrlich believes 
that these cells have side-chains which have certain special 
affinities. In this way the diphtheria toxin may be 
supposed to be bound to certain nerve cells ; and likewise 
tetanus toxin. The side-chains he calls receptors. When 
thus bound by a toxin molecule, they are supposed to be 
useless to the cell and are cast off into the blood-stream, 
and the cell is supposed to be stimulated to produce more ; 
not only so, but stimulated to produce an overplus which 
is alleged to be then cast into the blood-stream, as the 
cell would become overstocked. Thus he accounts for 
the presence of antitoxin free in the blood, the free receptors 
acting as antitoxin to the toxin circulating. The toxin, 
which thus unites with the antitoxin, he conceives as 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 203 

having two affinities : one which unites with the antitoxin, 
the haptophore ; the other, the toxophore, by which the 
harmful effects are produced. These two affinities are 
the affinities of two different atom-groups, of which the 
toxin is supposed to be composed. In the toxoid bodies,, 
the toxophore group is altered or wanting, but they can 
still bind antitoxin, in virtue of their haptophore group. 

For other forms of immunity, which are more complex 
than the toxin-antitoxin one, some elaboration is required. 
In natural immunity, the blood contains a thermolabile 
substance which is bactericidal. To this substance 
Buchner gave the name " Alexine " ; Metchnikoff spoke of 
it as " Cytase " ; and Ehrlich renamed it " Complement." 
In active immunization, a more thermostabile substance, 
bactericidal in nature, appears in the serum, and has been 
variously called "Fixateur" (Metchnikoff), "Substance 
Sensibilisatrice " (Bordet), "Immune Body or Ambo- 
ceptor " (Ehrlich). This substance is found to act only 
in the presence of complement, and hence Ehrlich' s- 
conception that it has two combining affinities which 
must be satisfied to produce bacteriolysis. The one 
affinity binds it to complement, the other to the immunizing 
substance (bacterium or red blood ceh 1 , leucocytes and 
other body cells, toxins, ferments) ; called the Antibody - 
producer, or Antigen. The immune body he therefore 
called an amboceptor, or receptor with two hands, which 
he described as the cytophile haptophore and the comple- 
mentophile haptophore. He also believes that the 
complement is composed of two parts, a haptophore 
group and a zymophore group. According to Ehrlich, the 
complement is unable to act directly on the antigen or 
antibody-producer, but only when connected by the 
immune body or amboceptor. Bordet, however, believes 
that neither antigen nor immune body has any affinity 
for complement, until when they are united they can 
absorb the complement, but not through the immune body. 
The hypotheses of Ehrlich have been used to explain 
agglutination, precipitation, and other phenomena, with 
sundry modifications. It is at present unnecessary to follow 
the theory further, because in these fields its explanations- 
have been most called in question. This is not to be 



-204 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

wondered at considering the enormously increased and 
increasing complexity of the subject-matter. 

Under either theory of immunity, the immune-body 
produced in active immunization is specific, that is, there 
is a special immune-body produced for each antigen. On 
the other hand, the complement, or alexine, or cytase, is 
believed to be one and the same, though Ehrlich and his 
school have argued in favour of specific complements for 
specific amboceptors. 

FURTHER IMMUNITY PHENOMENA. 

These can be more easily followed after the terms used 
in the theories have been acquired. 

1. Filtration of Serum. Muir and Browning found 
that on filtering serum through a Chamberland bougie, the 
immune-body passed through, and the complement did not. 

2. Fixation of the Complement. Bordet and Gengou 
planned an experiment, called the " Bordet and Gengou 
Reaction," to demonstrate the presence in a given serum 
of a specific immune-body, even in very small quantities. 
To this reaction the term " Fixation of the Comple- 
ment " is now commonly applied, and has its best known 
practical use in the " Wassermann Reaction." They 
performed two parallel experiments, (i) and (2), in which 
they used the following mixtures : 

(i). Heated immune plague serum + plague bacilli 
emulsion + fresh normal serum. 

(2). Heated normal serum + plague bacilli emulsion + 
fresh normal serum. 

Set aside for five hours at blood heat. Then added to 
-each mixture : 

(a) Heated haemolytic serum + washed red blood cells. 

Observe results : Mixture (i) shows no haemolysis ; 
mixture (2) shows haemolysis. 

The explanation of this phenomenon is after this 
manner : Looking at (a) we see that the mixture there 
requires the addition of complement to produce haemolysis, 
since the complement in the serum has been destroyed by 
heat. Therefore, when mixture (2) produces haemolysis, 
\ve infer that it must have supplied complement ; and 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 205 

similarly that mixture (i), since it did not produce haemo- 
lysis, could not have supplied any complement. We have 
therefore to examine mixtures (i) and (2) carefully to- 
determine the cause of their different actions. To do this,, 
they may be rewritten thus : 

(i). Specific immune-body -{- specific antibody-producer 
+ complement. 

(2). Non-specific immune -body + specific antibody- 
producer -f complement. 

They differ only in their immune-bodies (normal serum 
is believed to contain non-specific immune-bodies). It is 
therefore inferred that in (i), since no complement is left 
free, it has become bound by the joint action of the specific 
immune-body and the corresponding antibody-producer. 
In (2), since the immune-body and the antibody-producer 
do not correspond, no binding or fixation of the complement 
occurs, and so haemolysis takes place on adding (a). It 
should be noted here, that the quantity of complement 
used is determined by previous experiment, as the presence 
of an excess over the quantity which can be bound by the 
amounts of immune-body and antibody-producer would 
lead to haemolysis, even in (i). 

This reaction is capable of many applications in the 
determination of specific immune-bodies in a serum and of 
specific antibody-producers (antigens) in a serum. We 
shall here describe briefly the so-called " Wasscrmann 
test " for the diagnosis of syphilis, by determining the 
presence in the patient's blood of an immune body, capable 
when mixed with syphilitic antibody-producer (antigen) 
of causing fixation of complement. 

Wassermann Test. Requisites : 

(1) Specific antibody-producer, referred to usually as 
the antigen. 

(2) Red blood cells of a sheep, washed free of com- 
plement. 

(3) Serum of a rabbit's blood, haemolytic to sheep's red 
cells, heated before use, to destroy its complement. 

(4) Fresh guinea-pig's serum, to supply complement. 

(5) Serum from the patient, heated to 56 C., which 
serum is to be tested for the presence of specific immune- 
body or antibody. 



206 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

1. The antigen at first used was a salt solution extract 
of the liver of a syphilitic fretus. Alcoholic extracts have 
also been used, and it has been discovered that the 
extracts of normal liver and spleen, and even a I per cent 
emulsion of lecithin, will act as antigen. (This shows how 
little we must know of possible fallacies, in tests like this, 
with highly complex bodies like liver extract. It does 
not impugn its specificity for pure antigens, though it 
suggests the possibility of two different substances, with 
similar affinities for the immune-body produced by one of 
them. Of course the probability of this other substance 
being present, under the conditions of the experiment, is 
small, but must never be lost sight of.) The quantity of 
antigen to be used has to be carefully predetermined, as 
large excess of antigen has been found to cause binding of 
the complement, even in the absence of the immune-body. 
A series of trials of varying quantities of antigen with the 
same amount of complement in each case, shows the 
largest quantity of antigen which can be used without 
exerting this action. This amount of antigen is arranged, 
by proper dilution, to be present in i c.c. 

2. Washed Red Blood Cells. Som sheep's blood is 
gathered under aseptic precautions into a small sterile 
flask, containing sterile solution of sodium citrate (0-5 per 
cent) and sodium chloride (0-85 per cent). The corpuscles 
are separated by centrifugalizing, and washed repeatedly 
in the same way with sterile salt solution, to get rid of 
serum-complement and serum-precipitins. They are then 
brought down to a 5 per cent emulsion in salt solution, by 
mixing them with 19 times their bulk of the same. 

3. Hcemolytic Serum for Sheep's Cells. This is obtained 
by injecting a rabbit with washed red blood cells of a sheep, 
obtained as above. Of the 5 per cent emulsion, three or 
four injections are given at intervals of 5 to 6 days ; the 
first injection of 5 c.c., the second of 10 c.c., the third of 
15 c.c., and the fourth of 20 c.c. ; intravenously or intra- 
peritoneally. Ten days later than the final injection the 
serum is obtained by drawing blood from the carotid 
artery, allowing it to clot, and pipetting off the serum. 
A high-potency serum is desirable so that a small quantity 
only may be required. This obviates or reduces the risk 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 207 

of precipitates, due to precipitins in the rabbit's serum for 
sheep's serum (from insufficient washing of the injected 
corpuscles), acting on any sheep's serum present, from 
insufficient washing of the corpuscles used in the test. The 
serum is inactivated by heating to 56 C. The quantity 
of haemolytic serum to be used must be accurately deter- 
mined, in relation to a definite amount of complement. 
This is the more necessary since it has been shown that, 
(contrary to Ehrlich's commonly accepted conception 
that immune -body and complement react in definite 
combining proportions), the haemolytic immune-body and 
a complement react in inverse proportions ; that is, the 
more immune-body, the less complement is required. The 
bearing of this on the test is that a very small quantity of 
complement left over by the combination of syphilitic- 
immune-body and antigen might suffice, in presence of 
large excess of haemolytic immune-body, to cause haemo- 
lysis ; thus giving a negative result in a positive case. 
The quantity is determined by putting up a number of 
mixtures, each containing O-T. c.c. of fresh guinea-pig 
serum to give complement, and i c.c. of the 5 per cent 
emulsion of sheep's corpuscles. To each mixture 
inactivated haemolytic serum is added, in smaller and 
smaller quantities. The smallest quantity which gives 
complete haemolysis is taken as the unit amount to be used 
in the test. The haemolytic unit may therefore be defined 
as " the smallest quantity of inactivated haemolytic 
serum which, in the presence of a stated amount of com- 
plement, is able to cause complete haemolysis in i c.c. of 
a 5 per cent emulsion of washed red blood cells." 

4. The Complement. This is obtained by drawing blood 
from a guinea-pig, allowing it to clot, and pipetting off the 
serum, or separating by the centrifuge. Such serum, 
kept at a low temperature, preserves its complement in 
a fairly constant amount for three days. 

5. The Serum to be tested is got from the patient under 
aseptic precautions, from the median basilic vein, from 
the finger, or from the ear. Three to four c.c. are with- 
drawn, as i c.c. of clear serum is required to go over 
the tests and controls. It is inactivated by heating to 
56 C. in a water-bath for 20 minutes. Noguchi advises 



208 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

54 C. Serum can also be obtained from cerebrospinal 
fluid, etc. 
PROCESS. 

(a). In a test tube, put the following : 

o-i c.c. of complement (fresh guinea-pig serum). 
0-2 c.c. of inactivated test serum (from patient). 
i'O c.c. of standardized antigen (liver extract, etc.). 
Add salt solution to make up bulk to 3 c.c. ; 
shake thoroughly, and place for I hour in 
incubator at 37 '5 C. 
(b). Now add, 

i-o c.c. of 5 per cent emulsion of sheep's red cells. 
2'0 units of haemolytic serum (determined as 

above) . 
Shake thoroughly, and incubate again at 37-5 C. 

for i to 2 hours. 
(c). Observe result. 

(i). No hamolysis. Immune-body or anti- 
body is present ; test positive. 
(2). Complete hcemolysis. Immune - body or 

antibody is absent ; test negative. 
Several controls should be put up at the same time to 
preclude error. Such are : a test with known normal 
serum ; tests with antigen and complement alone to see 
that antigen is not fixing complement ; test of haemolytic 
serum and cells and complement with and without antigen 
to see that haemolysis is actually possible, and tests with 
known syphilitic serum with and without antigen. In 
all these controls, except that with known syphilitic serum 
with antigen, complete haemolysis should occur. 

Noguchi has modified the test by using human red cells 
and an anti-human haemolytic serum. This simplifies the 
test in that the patient's red cells may be used in testing 
his own serum, and in that no antibody for his red cells 
exists in his own serum (human serum at times contains an 
antibody to sheep's cells) . Anti-human haemolytic serum is 
prepared and standardized in a similar way to that 
described as used in preparing anti-sheep haemolytic serum. 
Human serum, when used to provide complement, is said 
to vary more in its content than guinea-pig serum, to absorb 
10 times as much immune-body, and to be less sensitizing. 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 209 

Fleming's modification is to use the haemolytic immune- 
body in human serum for sheep's corpuscles, and thus he 
can use the complement in the patient's blood. This 
simplifies the process. 

D'Este Emery uses human red cells, sensitized with 
heated immune serum from a rabbit which has been 
injected with human cells. He advises only 5 minutes' 
incubation in a water-bath at 38 C., which very appre- 
ciably shortens the time taken for the test. 

Browning, Cruickshank, and McKenzie describe " a 
method of carrying out the reaction which is very reliable 
in practice, and depends on the fact that the amount of 
complement absorbed by a mixture of serum and lecithin 
is increased on the addition of cholesterin, if the serum is 
syphilitic ; but not, if the serum is normal. Accordingly, 
two series of tests are carried out simultaneously in the 
one, complement is added to the mixture of serum and 
lecithin ; in the other, to the mixture of serum, lecithin, 
and cholesterin. If more complement is absorbed in 
the second series than in the first, then the reaction is 
positive." 

VALUE OF THE TEST. Like the agglutination or Widal 
test for enteric fever, the fixation of complement or 
Wassermann test for syphilis has its limitations. 

It is almost always negative in healthy subjects, but 
quite often gives a positive reaction in those suffering from 
leprosy, scarlet fever, jaundice, yaws, sleeping-sickness, 
and the acute stage of malaria. 

In the primary stage of syphilis, a negative result is 
usually got in the first fortnight. Thereafter one may 
expect a. positive result in 50 per cent of the cases, and 
its absence has some weight. 

In the secondary stage, in the presence of a suspected 
rash, a positive reaction is got in 50 to 70 per cent of 
the cases. 

In the tertiary stage, with progressive lesions present, 
the absence of the reaction is almost conclusive proof that 
another diagnosis than syphilis must be sought. 

In later stages, a positive reaction shows that the patient 
is not cured. Does a negative reaction show that he is. 
cured ? If a positive reaction was got previously, then it 

14 



210 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

is likely, always excluding treatment with mercury, which 
inhibits the reaction. 

If, at any stage, the patient is under treatment with 
mercury, a negative reaction has no value for diagnosis. 
Stop treatment for one to two months, and test again. 
Salvarsan or " 606 " also inhibits the test. 

In a few cases of syphilis, no reaction is given at any 
time. 

In congenital syphilis, the reaction may persist through- 
out life, and be present even where there are no evidences 
of active pathological processes. The examination of 
the blood of the mother will usually give corroboration, 
and that of the father may, but not necessarily. 

In tabes dorsalis, general paralysis, and aneurysm, a 
large number of positive results have been obtained ; about 
60 per cent in tabes, and 99 per cent in general paralysis. 
In the latter it is got in the cerebrospinal fluid. 

Porges-Meier Reaction. Equal parts of clear blood 
serum and a I per cent emulsion of lecithin or other lipoid 
substance in carbolized salt solution, are mixed and allowed 
to stand at room temperature for 5 hours. Normal serum 
causes no precipitate, but syphilitic serum does. This test 
is not nearly so delicate macroscopically as Wassermann's, 
and hence, while much more simple, is not so readily 
interpreted by the naked eye. Jacobsthal has studied it 
microscopically, by the aid of the ultra-microscope. He 
found that with normal serum, the particles of the lecithin 
emulsion appeared as isolated brilliant points, showing 
active Brownian movements. With a syphilitic serum, 
these brilliant points were seen to run together to form a 
large and brilliant mass. Intermediate reactions were 
noted, in which partial agglomeration occurred into small 
brilliant masses or brilliant chains. These phenomena 
were tested against the Wassermann reaction, and were 
found to run parallel to it. 

Determination of an Antigen by Complement- 
Fixation. The same principles apply, but in this case 
the immune-body present in the serum is known, and a 
serum is tested which is supposed to contain the corres- 
ponding antigen It has been applied to test blood for 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 211 

the antigen of B. typhosus, using highly potent anti- 
typhoid serum obtained from an immunized rabbit. 

Deviation of the Complement. Neisser and Wechs- 
berg, experimenting with mixtures of specific inactivated 
immune sera, specific antigen (bacteria) and complement, 
found that, beginning with the complement in excess, 
more and more bacteria were destroyed as the amount 
of immune -body was increased, up to a maximum. 
Beyond this, increase of the amount of immune-body 
lessened bacteriolysis, and finally in great excess, seemed 
to stop it entirely. To this phenomenon they gave the 
name of " deviation of the complement," in accordance with 
their theory that free immune-body has a greater affinity 
for antigen than immune-body joined to complement ; 
and so in great excess of immune-body, the immune-body 
appropriates all the bacterial receptors, to the exclusion 
of the immune-body joined to complement ; hence the 
cessation of bacteriolysis. This explanation cannot now 
be accepted, and so the term " deviation of the comple- 
ment " is unfortunate and should be dropped. It is 
possible that the explanation of the phenomenon should 
be sought on physical lines, the excessive dilution of the 
mixture with serum containing immune-body reducing 
the chances of bacteriolysis by the complement in the same 
time-limit ; and it is possible the complement may be 
inhibited by other constituents of the serum added. 

Heterolysins, Isolysins, Autolysins. A haemolysin 
produced in the blood of one animal by the injection 
of the red cells of another species, is called a " hetero- 
lysin." When the haemolysin is produced by injection 
of red cells of a member of its own species, it is called an 
" isolysin." Both of these have been produced. The 
production of a haemolysin in an animal by the injection 
of its own red cells, has not been accomplished. If such 
a haemolysin were produced, it would be called an " auto- 
lysin." The injection of isolysins produces " anti- 
isolysins," which like the heterolysins and isolysins are 
specific. The search for autolysins is clinically significant, 
as a possible theory for paroxysmal haemoglobinuria.

ANAPHYLAXIS. 

I. GENERAL PRINCIPLES. 

As already defined, anaphylaxis is a supersensitiveness 
induced in man and animals by the injection of certain 
substances, mostly, so far as is known, of an albuminous 
nature. The ideas on this subject have grown around 
anomalous phenomena following on the injection of diph- 
theria toxin and antitoxin. Thus v. Behring and others 
noted that occasionally animals highly immune to the 
toxin showed excessive susceptibility to small doses of 
the toxin. Very soon after the introduction of the serum 
treatment of diphtheria in 1894, certain symptoms were 
observed to follow the injection of the serum, which, at 
first ascribed to the antitoxin contained in it, were finally 
found to be due to the horse serum which carried the 
antitoxin. These symptoms were hence called " Serum 
Sickness " or " Serum Disease " and were mostly a rash 
of an erythematous nature, and fever. These come on in 
most cases about the ninth day, but vary from the third 
to the nineteenth. Fever is not always present, and the 
rash is quite often urticarial, and occasionally scarlatini- 
form or morbilliform, is local to the point of injection or 
becomes general, is fugitive or persistent. Articular 
pains may accompany the rash, and may be severe. The 
frequency of these symptoms varies ; from 30 to 55 
per cent of the cases treated with serum are stated to 
show them in some degree or other. Some oedema is 
also noted by Currie, as accompanying the rash. The 
similarity of these symptoms to those of the specific 
infective diseases is striking, and led to the name " serum 
disease," which has therefore an incubation period (after 
subcutaneous injection) averaging nine days, and a 
duration of two days on the average. That these 
symptoms were due to the horse serum, and not to the 
antitoxin, has been proved by such symptoms foUowing 
the injection of the normal serum of the horse. Another 
group of symptoms which on rare occasions followed the 
use of serum, was not at once recognized as due to it, but 
by the accumulation of cases and certain special features 
connected with them, the causal action of the serum was 



IMMUNITY AND AXAPHYLAXIS 213 

obviously suggested, and experiments on animals proved 
the truth of the inference. These symptoms differed 
from those of serum disease in that they came on immedi- 
ately or within an hour after the injection, were very 
severe, and in some cases ended fatally. The earliest 
recorded case is that of the son of Professor Langerhans, 
who was given a prophylactic dose of serum, took ill at 
once, and died shortly afterwards. The next recorded 
cases were three communicated by Goodall to the Anti- 
toxin Committee of the Clinical Society (of which 
Committee -he was a member). The first of these was 
that of a girl, aged 4 years, admitted to hospital suffering 
from diphtheria. She was given 4000 units on October 
24th, 1897, and the same amount on October 25th and 
26th. On Nov. 3rd there was a slight urticarial rash. On 
Nov. 30th she had a well-marked relapse of diphtheria, and 
was injected with 4000 units of antitoxin. " Within twenty 
minutes of the injection, she was seized with shiverings, 
quickly followed by two convulsions. Seen a few minutes 
later by the assistant medical officer, the convulsions had 
ceased, but the child was in a drowsy state, and the 
temperature had risen to 105 F. . . . There was no 
rash. . . . During the night the child vomited several 
times ; about 6 a.m. on Dec. ist a rash was noticed; and 
was a multiform erythema. It persisted till Dec. 5th, and 
while it was present the temperature remained up and 
the pulse was very rapid. On Dec. 5th and loth there 
were twitchings of the mouth, and throughout the child was 
drowsy and apathetic, and had a bad colour. She slowly 
recovered and left the hospital well on Feb. 3rd." Similar 
cases could be multiplied, and some given in which the 
immediate reaction is limited to a local or general rash. 

Such cases giving an immediate reaction fall into two 
groups : (i) Where the serum has not previously been 
injected ; and (2) Where a dose of horse serum has been 
administered on a previous occasion (excluding doses 
given within the incubation period of the serum disease). 

i. In the first group numerous fatalities have been 
recorded. In most of these, a history of asthma, or some 
similar condition, has been noted, and this is very 
important, since the subcutaneous injection of diphtheria 



214 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

antitoxin has been recommended as a cure for asthma. 
A record of a fatal result in a man of 52 years, who died 
in tonic spasm ten minutes after receiving the serum, 
elicited particulars of 16 similar cases, and in the 
" Therapeutic Gazette " for March I5th, 1909, a short 
account is given of these, with 14 others, making 30 in all, 
in which alarming symptoms followed shortly after the 
injection, and ended fatally in 16 cases. In 22 of the 30 
cases there was a history of asthma or some similar 
affection. (Goodall in Public Health, January, 1911). 

2. Where there is a record of a previous administration 
of serum, while the immediate symptoms may be very 
alarming and dangerous, so far no fatality has been 
reported. The use of serum day after day in a severe case 
of diphtheria is not followed by these manifestations, 
unless a period of at least ten days separates the first dose 
from that causing the symptoms. It is this feature which 
suggested that the symptoms were due to supersensitive- 
ness to serum, following on an attack of serum disease. 
The condition, beginning ten days after the first injection of 
serum, has been present in persons after five years, and may 
yet be found at a longer period. Experimental work on 
the subject has shown that rabbits injected with horse 
serum are very sensitive to a subsequent dose, show severe 
symptoms, and often die. This has been called the 
" Phenomenon of Arthus." The " Phenomenon of 
Theobald Smith " is that guinea-pigs used to standardize 
antitoxin, when injected with a toxin-antitoxin mixture 
were always killed on the subsequent injection, after ten 
days, of normal horse serum. Otto, Rosenau, and Anderson, 
working independently, showed conclusively that the action 
of the serum was without relation to its antitoxin content ; 
that sensitation of the guinea-pig was most marked after 
10 days ; that very small doses were efficient (o-ooi c.c. or 
less) ; that the condition was transmissible from mother to 
offspring ; that it was specific for the particular serum 
used ; that it was not a haemolytic nor precipitin action ; 
that the condition could be conferred on another animal by 
injecting it with the serum of a sensitized animal ; that a 
considerable dose of serum (5 c.c.) is required for the 
second injection ; and that the symptoms are prompter in 



IMMUNITY AND AXAPHYLAXIS 215 

appearing if the second injection is made intraperitoneally, 
cardially, or cerebrally, than if given subcutaneously. 
Sensitized animals which recover from the second injec- 
tion are thereafter immune (Antianaphylaxis). This im- 
munity may also be purchased by the injection of large 
quantities of the sensitizing serum towards the middle or 
end of the incubation period, but the duration of this 
immunity is believed by Otto to be short. 

In a number of cases where a second injection is 
given after an interval, no immediate reaction (w r ithin 
24 hours) follows, but an "Accelerated Reaction," that 
is, the local and general symptoms of serum disease are 
noted earlier than in the previous attack, or than is the 
average where no record exists. 

The simplest explanation of the phenomena of anaphy- 
laxis is that of Wolff-Eisner, who holds that all proteid 
substances contain a toxic part, which does not produce 
an antibody when injected into animals. On the first 
injection a lysin is formed which breaks up the proteid, 
liberating the toxic part. A second injection results in 
the rapid liberation of the toxic part by the action of the 
already-present lysin, and hence the toxaemia. The 
profound affection of the nervous system, the general 
vaso-dilatation, and the more rapid action on intracranial 
injection, all suggest some substance which acts as a toxin 
on the nerve tissues. In this connection the use of serum 
for the cure of asthma is interesting, because it could be 
explained (if the patient survive) as diminished nerve- 
irritability to proteid. 

II. ANAPHYLAXIS TO WHITE-OF-EGG. 

Besredka and Bronfenbrenner in their most recent 
memoire (Ann. de I'lmtitut Pasteur, Mai, 1911), have 
studied very carefully the anaphylaxis produced by the 
injection subcutaneously of white-of-egg, both raw and 
heated to 100 C. They produced active anaphylaxis by 
the injection of 0-5 c.c. of white-of-egg, diluted with an equal 
quantity of normal saline solution. The state of 
anaphylaxis appeared in 16 to 20 days ; with a smaller 
dose ( T i^ c.c.), it appeared in 12 days. The injection 
of white-of-egg heated to 100 C. into other guinea-pigs, 



216 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

produced a state of milder anaphylaxis than the raw white- 
of-egg. They hence conclude that the constituent of the 
white-of-egg which causes sensitation, while attenuated by 
heat, is thermostabile. This active state of anaphylaxis 
lasts for several months. 

Passive anaphylaxis was produced within 24 hours after 
the injection into a guinea-pig of the serum of a guinea-pig 
which had been previously treated with white-of-egg. The 
injection thereafter into the jugular vein of the sensitized 
guinea-pig of -g^ to y-^ c.c. of white-of-egg, produced 
the classical symptoms of anaphylaxis, with death in i 
to 3 minutes. On the other hand, when the serum and the 
white-of-egg were injected at the same time, one guinea-pig 
showed a marked dyspnoea and some malaise immediately 
after the injection, but quickly recovered ; another showed 
slight respiratory distress ; and a third showed no reaction. 
In all three the injection was into the jugular vein ; in 
the first two it consisted of 2 c.c. of anaphylactic serum 
mixed with y^ c.c. of white-of-egg ; in the third guinea- 
pig, it consisted of 1-5 c.c. of serum mixed with i c.c. of 
10 per cent solution of white-of-egg, equal to y 1 ^ c.c. of 
white-of-egg. Passive anaphylaxis, thus quickly induced, 
disappears more quickly than the active form, namely 
in about a fortnight. The mixture of the anaphylactic 
serum of the rabbit sensitized to white-of-egg, with white- 
of-egg, produced a precipitate. This was collected and 
diluted in normal saline, and injected into the jugular 
vein of two fresh (non-sensitized) guinea-pigs, and produced 
no reaction. 

Whether active or passive anaphylaxis was conferred, 
the injection of a minute dose intravenously or intra- 
cerebrally produced the classical symptoms and shock 
resulting in death, described in the anaphylaxis due to 
serum, and milk. Injected intraperitoneally, it is rare to 
get grave symptoms ; subcutaneously, no anaphylactic 
symptoms have been noted. This is markedly different 
from serum anaphylaxis, where the subcutaneous route 
is as fatal as the others. From this Besredka and 
Bronfenbrenner deduce that the most important thing in 
the production of the anaphylactic shock is the rapidity 
with which the antibody in the blood comes into contact 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 217 

with the antibody-producer or antigen. White-of-egg 
being a viscous liquid is slowly absorbed from the peri- 
toneum or subcutaneous spaces, and so the combination 
of the antibody and antigen has not the suddenness or 
instantaneousness which follows intravenous injection. 
(This deduction suggests that the antigen may act in a 
catalytic manner, causing an amount of chemical action 
out of proportion to its own mass injected. In such a 
case, the symptoms may be partly due to the accom- 
paniments of rapid chemical action, such as the evolution 
of heat, etc.) 

Antianaphylaxis can be produced to white-of-egg, as 
for serum, by the method of injecting small doses during 
the " incubation " time of anaphylaxis ; or by the injection 
of a minute dose, followed by a larger dose in 10 minutes, 
and so on for four doses. A guinea-pig, previously passively 
sensibilized, had o^Vo- c.c. injected intravenously ; in 
10 min. another injection of ^^ c.c. ; in another 10 
minutes, a third injection, this time of -fa c.c. ; and finally 
one of i c.c. Thereafter the injection of 2 c.c. of white-of- 
egg, non-diluted, caused uneasiness but nothing further. 
Antianaphylaxis can also be established by oral and by 
rectal feeding, in two to four days. The state of anti- 
anaphylaxis is not so lasting as in the case of serum ; it 
lasts about three weeks, and two weeks where obtained 
by the oral or rectal method. 

Besredka and Bronfenbrenner also found that the 
reactions were strictly specific, and that the anaphylaxis 
produced by white-of-egg was in the main specific. Feeble 
reactions were given by the white-of-egg of pigeon and 
turtle-dove. The anti-anaphylactic is strictly specific. 
Similar experiments were made with heated white-of-egg, 
with like results. The one protects little against the other, 
so that they conclude that their chemical constitution is 
different. 

III. SERUM-GLOBULIN. 

Turro and Gonzales have investigated the subject of 
anaphylaxis to determine the nature of the substance 
which causes anaphylaxis with blood serum. The 
globulins were precipitated from horse's serum, and the 



218 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

residual serum was kept. Guinea-pigs were injected with 
i c.c. of a 0-33 per cent solution of the globulins ; and 
12 days after, it was found that the minimal test dose was 
i c.c. of a 0-66 per cent solution (= 2 c.c. of the former 
solution). Anaphylactic shock developed rapidly, and there 
was a rapidly ascending paralysis, beginning in the hind 
limbs and causing death through asphyxia when the 
respiratory centres became affected, in 2 to 4 minutes. 
There were no convulsions, but in the male animals there 
was an abundant emission of serum. 

Another set of fresh guinea-pigs were given i c.c. of a 
i per cent dilution of the globulin-free serum ; and in 
twelve days thereafter, a test dose of the globulin solution 
produced no symptoms of anaphylaxis. (No mention is 
made of a test with the globulin-free serum itself.) An 
animal injected with normal serum, and later with trie 
globulin solution test dose, showed intense muscular 
tremors, (the animal jumping about), but all ended in 
recovery. 

When the blood of a sensitized guinea-pig is mixed 
with globulin solution, and i c.c. injected into the jugular 
vein of a normal guinea-pig, the animal dies in 2 to 3 
minutes with symptoms identical with those described 
in animals sensitized with pure globulins. They proceeded 
to study the anaphylactic poison, which they found is 
readily destroyed by oxidation and light, is dialysable, 
is thermostabile, and is soluble in alcohol and ether. They 
conclude that it is alkaloidal in nature, and should be 
considered a leucomaine, that is, a toxic substance produced 
in the living body by proteid metabolism, and not by 
bacterial action. 

IV. CLASSIFICATION. 

The foregoing resum& of the subject of anaphylaxis 
shows that it can be classified in the same manner as 
immunity into : 

1. Natural Anaphylaxis. 

2. Acquired Anaphylaxis. 

And each of these into sub-groups, thus : 



IMMUNITY AND ANAPHYLAXIS 219 

Natural anaphylaxis depends on 

a. Species of animal, e.g., cholera in man ; anthrax 

in cattle ; glanders in horses. 

b. Age, e.g., diphtheria in children ; erysipelas in 

elderly individuals. 

c. Individual, e.g., to white of egg, blood serum even 

by ingestion. (" One man's food is another 
man's poison.") 

Acquired anaphylaxis depends on 

a. An attack of the disease, e.g., erysipelas and 

diphtheria. 

b. The injection of dead cells, e.g., tuberculin. 

c. The injection of nitrogenous matter, e.g., blood 

serum and white of egg. 

The subject of anaphylaxis has been dealt with here 
because of its intrinsic importance, and because it would 
seem to demand a restatement, in the near future, of the 
philosophy not only of infection but of medicine generally. 
The old idea of " diathesis " acquires anew its importance 
(having received direct experimental proof), and many 
apparently worn-out theories and old-fashioned explana- 
tions of disease may have new life put into them. 



CHAPTER XII. 

MICROCOCCI. 

THESE organisms consist of cells more or less globular in 
form and varying in size from 0-5 micron to 2 micra in 
diameter, but most measure about I micron ( T ^Vir mm., or 
^sooo of an inch). They are usually classified according 
to the mode of division or the resultant shape. Thus 
we have streptococci, staphylococci, diplococci, tetracocci 
(tetragenus), and sarcinae. None show endogenous spore 
formation, but of some it is alleged that they form arthro- 
spores. Most are non-motile, but a few motile species 
possessing flagella have been described (none pathogenic). 

STAPHYLOCOCCI. 

These were first demonstrated in pus by Pasteur in 
1880 and Ogston in 1881, and in pure culture by 
Becker in 1883. Rosenbach in 1884 established specificity 
as cause of some forms of wound-suppuration and of 
osteomyelitis. They are so named from their growth in 
grape-like clusters. Several hundred species have been 
described, but the chief varieties are : Staphylococcus 
pyogenes (aureus, albus, and citreus) ; Staphylococcus 
epidermidis albus ; Staphylococcus cereus (albus and 
flavus). 

The common characteristics are : Grape-like clusters of 
cocci, 0-9 micron in diameter ; non-motile ; non-sporing ; 
grow readily on most media ; stain readily ; Gram-positive ; 
gelatin-liquefying ; produce acid and clot in milk ; form 
indol ; reduce nitrates to nitrites ; show colour reduction 
with litmus, methylene-blue, and rosanilin (fuchsin) ; 
aerobes, but facultative anaerobes ; optimum temperature 
for growth, 28 to 30 C. Range from 8 to 42 C. 
Thermal death-point 30 min. at 80 C. ; 'freezing useless. 

Cultures. Put up (i) broth, (2) agar slope, (3) agar 



MICROCOCCI 221 

plate, (4) gelatin stab plate and slope, (5) milk, (6) potato, 
(?) peptone water, (8) nitrate, and (9) sugar media. 

In broth, uniform turbidity with thin surface, pellicle 
ultimately settling as a heavy mucoid deposit, with a sour 
odour like weak butyric acid. 

On agar slope, abundant growth in 24 hours at 37 C. ; 
with smooth shining surface and resembling a streak of 
oil paint. Single colonies are circular. 

On agar plate, numerous small, shining, pin-head shaped 
colonies; round, finely granular, with smooth edges, 
remaining discrete, and varying greatly in size. 

On gelatin plate, growth occurs readily at 20 C., and 
shows much the same as in agar. The colonies are not 
flat, but rise from the surface as the segment of a sphere. 
Liquefaction of the gelatin ; and gradually (after 48 hours 
or more), shallow saucer-shaped depressions are formed, 
which grow larger and finally become confluent. Lique- 
faction of gelatin by staphylococci is due to a ferment-like 
body elaborated by them and spoken of as " gelatinase " 
and which can be obtained apart from the cocci by 
filtration of cultures. It is an extremely thermolabile 
substance. 

In gelatin stab, a streak of growth is visible in 24 hours, 
and liquefaction begins at the top in 2 to 3 days, forming 
a funnel with flocculent deposit of the bacteria. Ultimately 
fluidification extends to the wall of the tube. 

In milk, coagulation takes place in 3 to 4 days with 
formation of lactic and butyric acids. 

On potato, growth is abundant, rather dry, and 
usually deeply pigmented. 

In peptone water, indol is formed. 

Pigment formation is best seen in serum or starchy 
media and aerobically only. It is insoluble in water but 
soluble in alcohol, chloroform, ether, and benzol. It is 
a C, H, and O compound, a " lipochrome ", or fatty pig- 
ment. Strong H 2 SO 4 changes it to green or green-blue. 

Toxic Products. Endotoxins, haemolysins, leucocidins. 

Pathogenicity. For man : abscesses, boils, carbuncles, 
endocarditis, osteomyelitis ; for animals : rabbits most, 
mice medium, guinea-pigs least. 

Immunization. Take three-weeks-old culture, heat at 



222 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

60 C. for one hour ; inject 100 to 250 million of the dead 
staphylococci, repeating in 3 to 4 days later ; opsonins 
increased. 

Habitat. Skin and mucous surfaces. 

Differentiation: (Gordon). Staphylococcus pyogenes 
aureus clots milk, liquefies gelatin, at times produces 
green fluorescence in neutral red broth, reduces nitrates 
to nitrites, produces acid in Lemco media containing 
maltose, lactose, glycerin, and mannite. Staphylococcus 
epidermidis albus gives the same reactions, except that it 
does not produce acid with mannite. 

Houston's Lemco Medium : consists of distilled water 
containing i per cent of Lemco, i per cent of peptone, 
o-i per cent of sodium bicarbonate, and litmus solution 
to colour. Add i per cent of test substance (carbo- 
hydrate, etc.). 

STREPTOCOCCI. 

Ogston in 1881 first differentiated between the 
irregularly grouped staphylococci and the chain cocci 
or streptococci. Pure cultures were first obtained by 
Fehleisen in 1883 and Rosenbach in 1884. Named from 
tendency to form chains, and so the group includes 
micro-organisms which differ considerably from each 
other in cultural and pathogenic characters. The strep- 
tococci pathogenic to man mostly form chains of eight 
or more individual cocci, while the saprophytic varieties 
are apt to be united in shorter groups. On this basis 
streptococci have been divided into S. longi and S. breves, 
but the distinction is not a reliable one. Similarly, 
the streptococcus of ordinary pus formation was thought 
to be different from that of erysipelas. This is now proved 
not to be the case, and the two are regarded as one and the 
same. These statements enable one to attach the proper 
significance to the various names used ; to wit : S. pyogenes, 
S. erysipelatis, S. longus, S. brevis. S. conglomeratus is a 
variety, and is so called from its forming in broth culture 
minute granules composed of very long chains (identical 
with S. anginosus or scarlatinae). Streptococci grow well 
on all the richer media, and better in broth made from meat 
or veal than from meat extract. Animal serum and 



MICROCOCCI 223 

glucose render media more favourable for streptococci 
cultivation, and alkalinity 0-5 per cent. 

Streptococci are easily stained with the usual aniline 
dyes and are Gram-positive. They are non-sporing, non- 
motile, and non-flagellar. They (at least the pyogenic 
species) do not liquefy gelatin. Optimum temperature 
37-5 C. Growth takes place at 15 to 20 C. (distinction 
from pneumococci) . Aerobiosis is the suitable environ- 
ment for most races, but strict anaerobiosis does not prevent 
development in suitable media. Size 0-5 to i micron. 

Cultures. In broth (bouillon) minute granules, which 
fall to the bottom and form a sparse powdery or sandy 
deposit. Diffuse clouding is rare. The long chain forms 
produce the coarser granules. 

In glucose broth, the rapid formation of lactic acid 
arrests development (i per cent of sterile CaCO 3 obviates) . 

In gelatin stab, in 48 hours a thin line forms which 
later is seen to be made up of minute rounded colonies 
of whitish colour reaching the size of a pin's head in 5 
to 6 days. No growth on surface nor liquefaction. 

On agar plates, the colonies are small, greyish, and 
delicately opalescent, are round, and tend to remain 
separate in stroke cultures. 

In milk, ready growth with acid formation but no clot 
(in pyogenic varieties). 

On potato, no growth. 

On blood agar plates, most cause haemolysis and decolor- 
ization (difference from pneumococci). Ferment lactose, 
saccharose, and salicin ; not inulin in Hiss's medium. 

Thermal Death-point : 10 minutes at 54 C. 

Virulence varies ; greatest for white mice and rabbits. 

Habitat : skin and mucous membranes. 

Diseases : cellulitis, erysipelas, osteomyelitis, bronchitis, 
pneumonia, empyema, pericarditis, otitis, pharyngitis, 
tonsillitis, septic endocarditis, septicaemia, puerperal fever. 

Toxins: streptolysin (bsemolytic). 

Immunization : variable results. 

Differentiation : (Andrews and Horder). Streptococcus 
pyogenes does not clot milk, nor give green fluorescence 
with neutral red broth, nor produce acid in Lemco media 
with ramnose, inulin, coniferin, and mannite. It produces 



224 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

acid with lactose, saccharose, and at times with salicin ; 
it grows on gelatin at 20 C. ; it forms long chains, and 
is pathogenic to mice. 

Streptococcus salivarius clots milk, produces acid with 
saccharose and lactose, and at times with raffinose ; at 
times grows on gelatin at 20 C., and at times produces 
fluorescence. It is negative to the other tests, and grows 
in short chains. 

Streptococcus anginosus gives the same reactions as 
S. salivarius, except that it never produces acid with 
raffinose ; it forms long chains, and it is pathogenic to mice. 

Streptococcus fcscalis (human) is positive to all the 
tests except production of acid with raffinose and inulin. 
It is non-pathogenic to mice, and it forms short chains. 

Streptococcus equinus (in horse dung) produces acid 
with saccharose, salicin, and coniferin, and grows on 
gelatin. It is otherwise negative ; forms short chains, and 
is non-pathogenic to mice. 

The pneumococcus forms short chains, is pathogenic to 
mice, clots milk, forms acid in lactose, saccharose, and 
raffinose, and at times in inulin. It does not grow on 
gelatin at 20 C. 

Examination of Pus. By using solid media and 
method of 3 dilutions. 

(1) Gelatin plates : Three tubes are melted at 30 to 
35 C. in a water-bath. Inoculate one with a loopful 
of pus, replug, and mix by rotating tube. This is tube 
of ist dilution. Inoculate second tube with 3 loopfuls 
from ist tube: tube of 2nd dilution. Inoculate third 
tube with 3 loopfuls from 2nd tube : tube of 3rd dilution. 
Now pour out all three tubes into dry sterile Petri dishes. 
Allow to set, and incubate at 20 C. 

(2) Agar plates : Same procedure, only melt at 100 C. 
and cool to 40 C. before inoculating, and work quickly. 
Warm the plates. Incubate at 37 C. 

PNEUMOCOCCUS. 

The pneumococcus has been at various times called 
Streptococcus pneumonias, Diplococcus pneumoniae, 
Micrococcus lanceolatus, and Fraenkel's pneumococcus. 



MICROCOCCI 225 

The sputum of cases of acute lobar pneumonia, injected 
into mice or rabbits, produced more constantly a septi- 
caemia with fatal results than did the sputum of healthy 
individuals. In this " sputum septicaemia," lance-shaped 
cocci in pairs were most frequently found. Weichselbaum 
in 1886 examined 129 cases of all forms of pneumonia, 
and described four organisms which he found, the most 
frequently present being the one now known as the pneumo- 
coccus. It was present in all forms. The Streptococcus 
pneumonia? (now believed to have been a more vigorous 
pneumococcus) was next in frequency, then the pneumo- 
bacillus, and lastly the Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus. 

Description. A small coccus, generaUy occurring in pairs, 
and surrounded by a definite capsule. The cocci are lance- 
shaped, like the flame of a candle ; and in the pair have 
the pointed ends opposed. A close resemblance to a 
bacillus is thus formed. The capsule is characteristic in 
preparations from the sputum and tissues, but is only got 
in serum cultures, and is absent at times even in the 
sputum and in scrapings from the lung. The coccus is 
non-motile, non-flagellar, non-sporing. It is readily 
stained by the usual aqueous aniline dyes, and it is Gram- 
positive. The capsule is well shown in specimens stained 
by Gram and counter-stained : it takes the latter. 

Cultures. Growth on the ordinary media is variable. 
From sputum it is best isolated by animal injection and 
cultures from the heart's blood. The best temperature is 
37-5 C. Growth does not take place as a rule below 25 C. 
The colonies are like drops of dew. Blood serum and blood 
agar are the best media. In gelatin stab (when growth 
takes place), a row of minute dots appears, but no lique- 
faction. In broth, a slight turbidity results, which settles 
to the bottom of the tube as a dust-like deposit. Cultures 
rapidly die out, and virulence is quickly lost. In milk, 
growth is rapid, with acid and clot, and capsules are 
usually formed. Prolonged life is said to have been got in 
cultures on ascitic agar and blood-smeared agar. The 
pneumococcus ferments saccharose, lactose, rafnnose, and 
inulin. 

Habitat. The mucous membranes of the mouth, nose, 
throat, and conjunctiva. 

15 



226 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Products. No soluble toxin yet isolated ; endotoxin 
by freezing and grinding. 

Pathogenicity. For mice and rabbits, very great ; for 
guinea-pigs, less ; for man, medium. Susceptibility is 
characterized by general septicsemic infection ; resistance 
by occurrence of localized processes, e.g., in man : acute 
lobar pneumonia, pleurisy, empyema, pericarditis, menin- 
gitis, otitis media, etc. 

Isolation. Inoculate a mouse at the root of the tail with 
a little of the suspected material. The animal dies in 24 
hours, and its blood is swarming with typical, encapsuled 
lance-shaped diplococci, if pneumococci present. 

Immunity. Agglutinins are formed, and agglutination is 
observed in 1-40 to 1-50 dilution with serum from pneu- 
monic patient, and most marked at time of crisis. Passive 
immunization with sera has been unreliable so far. A 
leucocyte extract with water has given encouraging results. 

Resistance. Has been found alive in dried sputum 
after 55 days. Ten minutes at 52 C. is fatal. Very 
sensitive to weak solutions of disinfectants, but not in 
sputum. 

STREPTOCOCCUS MUCOSUS. 

This organism has been isolated from cases of menin- 
gitis, peritonitis, phlebitis, and parametritis, and from 
certain cases of pneumonia. It shows a marked tendency 
to form chains, but often appears in diplococcus 
forms. It is also capsulated, but never lance-shaped. It 
reacts to sugars as does the pneumococcus. It is patho- 
genic to white mice, but not so markedly to the rabbit as 
the pneumococcus. Growths are similar. It excites the 
formation of weak agglutinins, which can also in some 
cases agglutinate pneumococci. Also anti-pneumococcic 
serum frequently agglutinates it. These facts suggest a 
group relationship. 

MENINGOCOCCUS. 

First described by two Italian observers in 1884, 
but first cultivated by Weichselbaum from cases of 
cerebrospinal meningitis in 1887. It is a small coccus, 
very like the gonococcus, and like it occurring in pairs, 



MICROCOCCI 227 

the adjacent sides being flattened like a coffee bean 
or two D's opposed to each other by the flat sides. 
In most cases it is present inside the protoplasm of 
the leucocytes in the exudation, the leucocytes being 
of the polymorphonuclear variety. Hence it has been 
called the Micrococcus intracellularis meningitidis. The 
variety of meningitis in which it is chiefly found is 
epidemic cerebrospinal meningitis, which is now a 
notifiable disease in a large number of districts. It is 
non-motile, non-sporing, non-flagellar, non-capsulated, 
and Gram-negative. It is found in the exudates, and 
specially in the spinal fluid obtained by lumbar puncture, 
and in such fluid it is well demonstrated in the cells by 
using Jenner's stain. It is easily stained by the usual 
dyes, and with methylene-blue stains irregularly. It is 
not readily cultivated on the ordinary media, and grows 
best on blood serum and ascitic agar. On blood serum, 
white shining viscid colonies appear in 24 hours. Cultures 
readily die out. It ferments maltose and dextrose with 
acid production (distinction from M. catarrhalis) . Involu- 
tion forms occur. In the patient, agglutinins and opsonins 
are formed. Distinguish from M. catarrhalis, which is found 
in the nose, and grows at room temperature, whereas M. 
meningitidis is not easily grown below 25 C. The sugar test 
is also helpful. M. pharyngis also grows at room temperature 
and ferments maltose, dextrose, saccharose, and laevulose. 
M. mucosus gives slimy growths. Other Gram-negative 
cocci are chromogenic. 

GONOCOCCUS. 

First found in urethral pus and pus from ophthalmia 
neonatorum by Neisser in 1879. Cultivated by Bumm 
in 1885 on human blood serum. Diploforms very 
similar to the meningococcus, and like it may be found 
in pus, intra- but also extra-cellularly. The gonococci are 
non-motile, etc., and Gram-negative. They are mostly 
extra-cellular in chronic discharges, and may be rather 
scarce. They do not grow on gelatin or agar, but on serum 
or ascitic agar, and best at blood heat. Growth ceases 
below 30 C. Colonies appear within 48 hours, but may 
not until four days. They are readily killed at 42 C. They 



228 



PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 



ferment dextrose but not maltose. A vaccine treatment 
for gonococcus has been used with success in chronic cases. 
An emulsion of gonococci in sterile salt solution (0-85 per 
cent) is heated to 65 C. for i hour. Inject 300 million, 
and give dose every 7 to 10 days, increasing to 1000 to 
1 200 million. 

MICROCOCCUS TETRAGENUS. 

Found in 1881 by Gaffky, in pulmonary cavities. 
Usually non-pathogenic in man. Grows weh 1 on ordinary 
media, clouds broth evenly, does not liquefy gelatin, clots 
milk with acid formation, is Gram-positive, and is cap- 
sulated in the body. It is pathogenic to white mice, 
causing septicaemia ; slightly so to guinea-pigs and rabbits, 
and non-pathogenic to house mice and rats. It has been 
described as the cause of abscesses, on one occasion of 
meningitis, and on another of septicaemia. 

MICROCOCCUS CATARRHALIS. 

Found in patients suffering from catarrh of the upper 
respiratory tract. Its chief claim to attention is its 
similarity in staining and morphology to the meningo- 
coccus and gonococcus. From the latter it is distinguished 
by its rapid growth on the ordinary culture media. From 
the meningococcus, with which it may be found in the 
nasal passages, it is similarly distinguished, but here the 
difference is one of degree only. The sugar tests are very 
helpful.

MICROCOCCUS MELITENSIS. 

This organism was first described by Bruce in 1887, 
as present in the spleen of patients dead of Malta (or 
undulant, rock, Mediterranean, or Neapolitan) fever. 



MICROCOCCI 229 

This is an endemic pyrexial disease, occasionally pre- 
vailing as an epidemic, having a long and indefinite 
duration and an irregular course, with, almost invariably, 
pyrexial relapses of an undulatory type. The illness 
may last from 20 to 300 or more days, averaging 60 to 
70 days, and having a mortality of about 2 per cent. 
The chief mode of spread formerly was the ingestion of 
goat's milk, in which the micrococcus was being excreted. 
The urine of patients is also infectious. The Mediterranean 
Fever Commission conclude that Malta fever is a septi- 
caemia, in which the specific organism can be recovered 
from the peripheral blood, the urine, and the faeces. 
Infection is not conveyed by the sputum, sweat, breath, 
or skin-scrapings of patients. It does not take place if 
contact is Limited to skin surfaces only, and if urinary and 
faecal contamination are excluded. It is probably occasion- 
ally conveyed by sexual intercourse. About 10 per cent of 
the Maltese goats excrete the micrococcus, and 50 per cent 
give a positive agglutination reaction. Goat's milk is prob- 
ably the prime source of the disease in most cases if not in all. 

Characteristics. Micrococcus melitensis is a very small 
coccus, 0-3 micron in diameter, occurs singly or in pairs, 
and at times in short chains. It is non-motile and Gram- 
negative ; does not ferment glucose (unlike ordinary strepto- 
coccus), and renders milk slowly alkaline. It is easily 
stained. Some observers describe it as a minute bacillus. 

Cultures. On agar, it forms minute transparent colonies 
likened to dew-drops, but only after 2 to 3 days' culture at 
37-5 C. On gelatin, liquefaction is not produced. In 
broth, no indol is formed, nor odour ; but a slight turbidity. 
On potato, a moist transparent growth is formed. 

Agglutination of the organism by the patient's serum 
is shown after the fifth day. In some cases it persists for 
years. 

Resistance. Is a vigorous organism and resists desicca- 
tion for weeks. 

Malta Fever. Other symptoms of the disease are : 
shifting rheumatic-like pains, profuse sweatings, con- 
stipation, local neuritis, emaciation, and almost always 
enlarged spleen. The micrococcus may be isolated by 
splenic puncture or from the blood. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

NON-SPORING BACILLI. 

THE COLON-TYPHOID-DYSENTERY GROUP. 

THIS is a large group, which includes the colon bacillus 
and its allies ; the typhoid bacillus ; paratyphoid bacilli ; 
dysentery bacilli and allies ; and Bacillus faecalis alcaligenes. 

Closely related to the group (but not properly within it) 
are the B. lactis aerogenes, B. mucosus capsulatus (Fried- 
laender's bacillus), and B. proteus. 

All the members of the group are bacilli and are very 
similar morphologically, but exhibit minor differences 
insufficient to permit of accurate diagnosis from mor- 
phology alone. All are non-sporing, non-liquefying of 
gelatin, Gram-negative, and grow well at room and body 
temperatures on artificial media. 

They are distinguished from one another by a careful 
cultural and biological study, to wit : reactions in special 
media (e.g. the FL-AG-IN-AC group of reactions : fluor- 
escence with neutral red, acid and gas with lactose, indol 
with peptone water, acid and clot in litmus milk) ; motility 
and flagella ; and reactions with, specific immune sera 
(chiefly agglutination). 

Bacillus Coli Communis is a name which stands for a 
group of organisms, one member of which was first described 
by Buchner in 1885. The one taken as a type of the group 
was obtained from the stools of a breast-fed infant, and 
was described by Escherich in 1886 as the Bacterium coli 
commune. It is now usually designated B. coli (Escherich). 

It is widely distributed in nature and has been isolated 
from air, water, and soil, but is found most abundantly and 
constantly in the intestinal tract of man and of many of 
the higher animals, from which habitat it probably finds 
its way into soil, water, and air. Its chief characteristics 
are : short plump rod, 2 to 4 micra long and 0-4 to 0-7 micron 
broad (very short oval and coccus-like forms are found. 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 231 

especially in the animal tissues) ; grows well on usual media ; 
curdles milk with acid production in forty-eight hours ; 
forms acid and gas with dextrose and lactose (gas = 
hydrogen and carbonic acid gas in proportion of 2 to i); 
some ferment saccharose ; some are weak and aberrant ; 
not usually pathogenic (agonal or post-mortem invasion 
excluded) ; sometimes causes peritonitis, cholecystitis, 
pyelitis, and cystitis ; can precipitate cholesterin from 
solution (hence may cause gall-stones) ; cannot peptonize 
native proteids (casein and egg albumen, etc.). 

Cultures. In broth : uniform turbidity. In gelatin stab : 
growth along whole line of stab and film-like abundant 
growth on surface, but no liquefaction. On gelatin plate : 
surface colonies are apt to show the typical grape-leaf 
formation. (In gelatin stab, a few gas bubbles may form, 
see later.) On agar slope : a dense glistening white or 
greyish growth. Same on blood serum. On agar plate : 
surface colonies show grape-leaf structure. On potato : 
abundant growth, at first greyish- white, turning later to 
yellowish-brown. Cultures are characterized by a peculiar 
foetid odour, not unlike that of diluted faeces. Grows well 
on media containing urine and bile. In peptone water : 
forms indol. In milk : acidity and clot. In lactose litmus 
agar : the medium becomes red along stab, and gas bubbles 
appear. In carbohydrate media : acid and gas are formed 
in presence of glucose, lactose, laevulose, galactose, 
maltose, raffinose, mannite, dulcite, and sorbite ; and 
occasionally in saccharose (cane sugar) and in the gluco- 
sides, salicin and arbutin. Some varieties change neutral- 
red, first to a rosy-red and then to a green fluorescence 
(in glucose broth) ; and most reduce nitrates to nitrites. 
Aerobe, but facultative anaerobe. Motile, having from 
4-12 peritrichal flagella. 

B. Typhosus was discovered by Eberth in 1880 in the 
spleen and mesenteric glands of persons dying of typhoid 
or enteric fever. In such sections the bacilli occur in 
groups, scattered individuals being rare. Gaffky in 1884 
first grew it in pure culture and studied its characters. 

Characteristics. Short plump rod with rounded ends, 
i to 3 micra long and 0*5 to o - 8 broad ; actively motile ; 
numerous peritrichal flagella (10 to 14) ; growth less 



232 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

luxuriant than B. coli ; Gram-negative ; produces acid but 
no gas in dextrose broth and agar, no change with lactose 
or saccharose, no clot in milk, but in litmus milk slight acid 
at first, from small quantity of monosaccharid present ; 
later, deep blue from formation of alkali ; no indol in 
peptone water ; on potato slight moist glistening growth, 
becoming dull and velvety. 

Cultures. In broth : uniform turbidity. In gelatin stab : 
growth to bottom of stab, and on surface as a thin leaf- 
like film or pellicle with irregular wavy margin. In gelatin 
plate, the colonies are smaller, more delicate, and more 
transparent than those of the colon bacillus of the same 
age. In agar plates, in twenty-four hours, small greyish 
colonies are formed, at first transparent but later opaque. 
On acid potato : slight moist glistening growth. 

Forms acid but no gas with dextrose, laevulose, galactose, 
maltose, mannite, and dextrin ; but no change with lactose 
and saccharose. 

In Hiss's tube medium (agar, gelatin, dextrose, Liebig's 
extract, salt, water), it gives uniform clouding owing to 
its motility, but no gas ; whereas dysentery bacillus grows 
only along stab, and colon bacilli form sky-rocket-like 
figures, and the medium is broken with gas bubble?. 

Optimum temperature, 37 C. ; range 15 to 41 C. 
Resistance like most non-sporing organisms, 30 min. at 
60 C., or 2 to 3 min. at 100 C. In ordinary tap or distilled 
water it is usually found dead in three weeks (Frankland). 
The researches of Dr. A. C. Houston have shown that in 
the crude river water derived from the Thames, raw 
typhoid bacilli die out in one to two weeks, whereas 
cultivated typhoid bacilli may persist for five weeks. On 
this basis, the storage of water for thirty days, preliminary 
to filtration, is looked upon as of prime importance in all 
waters derived from sources polluted by sewage. 

Does not multiply in water, even when impure. Is by 
preference a parasite, and when found outside the body 
can be usually traced to sewage of typhoid patient or 
convalescent (carrier). In natural bodies of water it 
retains its vitality for at least four to five days, and in 
sterile water it may be found surviving for three months. 
History of typhoid epidemics from sewage-polluted water 



NOX-SPORING BACILLI 233 

shows that danger is chiefly to be feared when pollution is 
recent. In soil and faecal matter, however, duration of 
vitality is more prolonged (five months in privy refuse, 
and fourteen days after being spread on ground), but no 
genuine multiplication proved. This suggests one mode 
of pollution of surface water and surface wells after rains, 
by the washing of dormant bacilli into the same, and to the 
danger of using human excrement for manuring vegetable 
gardens, and fields near water sources (Lincoln, 1905). 
Air-borne infection is rare. Sewer air is not regarded as 
an actual cause so much as a predisposing one. 

Pathogenicity. For man : enteric fever, typhoid fever, 
abdominal typhus (German), la fievre typhoide (French). 
For animals : do not multiply, and same effects by 
injection of dead bacilli, as that due to endotoxins. 
Chimpanzees have been infected by food, and have 
shown characteristic lesions. Intraperitoneal injections 
produce a short acute illness with pyrexia, etc., but non- 
specific. 

Specificity has not been absolutely proved according to 
Koch's postulates. In enteric fever the bacilli are present 
in the blood, the bowel, the urine, the sputum and the 
rose spots. Toxins are intracellular. 

Immunity usually follows one attack, and is due to 
bactericidal and bacteriolytic bodies. 

Active Immunization is accomplished in animals by a 
first injection of I c.c. of a broth culture heated for ten 
minutes at 60 C., followed in five or six days by a larger 
dose, and so on, until finally living cultures are injected in 
considerable doses without serious consequences. 

Wright's vaccination against typhoid has been used 
extensively in the British army. He uses a strain of 
bacillus standardized by passage through guinea-pigs, and 
sterilizes the culture by heating to 60 C. for five minutes. 
The first injection is of an amount of bacilli fatal to 100 
grm. of guinea-pig, or alternatively, 750 to 1000 million 
of dead bacilli. The second injection given eleven days 
later should be double the first. The first dose is followed 
by tenderness and swelling locally and at the adjacent 
lymphatic glands, and some pyrexia, all of which usually 
subside in twenty-four to forty-eight hours. The method 



234 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

is believed to reduce the case incidence and the mortality 
among vaccinated persons attacked. 

Vaccine treatment of typhoid fever on similar lines has 
been tried by Leishman and Smallman, using one-fifth of 
the dose used for protective inoculation. If the tempera- 
ture fall, the injection may be repeated every four days. 
Antityphoid serum has been used, but results are equivocal. 

Agglutination. The blood or blood serum of an animal 
previously inoculated with typhoid bacilli, when added to 
a suspension of living and motile typhoid bacilli, causes 
the latter to become motionless and aggregated (clumped) . 
This reaction is one given in many diseases after the 
attack a reaction of immunity ; but in enteric fever it is 
given during the attack a reaction of infection. The 
reaction is specific in high dilutions, but not absolutely 
so. Group bacilli are clumped, but in lower dilutions : 
for example, serum clumping typhoid bacilli in a dilution 
1-40,000 will clump paratyphoid bacilli in a dilution 
i-iooo, and coli bacilli in 1-500. The reaction is used 
for : (i) Diagnosis of disease (Widal's reaction) ; and 
(2) Diagnosis of bacteria (Grueber's reaction). 

1. Widal's Reaction. 

a. Microscopic method. Requirements : An eighteen to 
twenty-four hours' culture in broth of undoubted B. 
typhosus. Blood or serum. Platinum loop, a hollow 
ground slide, an ordinary slide or a watch-glass, cover- 
slips, a one-sixth-inch lens, and vaseline. 

PROCEDURE. i. Test motility of bacilli and absence of 
clumping by putting up a hanging drop of culture. If 
clumps, filter. If movements sluggish, warm. 

2. Take a clean dry slide and put on it nine loopfuls of 
sterile broth arranged in a small circle. Put one loopful 
of serum in centre of circle and mix. Dilution i-io. 
Now put one loopful of i-io dilution on a clean slide or 
hollow slide, mix with three loopfuls of sterile broth, and 
finally with one loopful of culture. Dilution is now 1-50. 

3. Mount one loopful on a cover-slip, invert over hollow 
slide, and examine. Examine again in fifteen minutes and 
after one hour. If reaction is positive, the bacilli will be 
arranged in groups and be non-motile, and between the 
clumps will be clear spaces. 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 235 

Or the serum may be diluted by means of a graduated 
pipette, such as a leucocytometer pipette, or by using a 
capillary pipette which is filled to a certain mark and 
emptied into a watch-glass, and the desired number of the 
full of the pipette of bouillon added and mixed. The 
mixture of a pipette-full of the diluted serum and of the 
bacillary emulsion is then examined, the final dilution 
being double that of the diluted serum. 

b. Macroscopic method or Sedimentation. Take a range 
of test tubes, 5 c.m. X 0-5 c.m., and put into each i c.c. 
of various serum dilutions and i c.c. of bacillary emulsion. 
Also put up a control with i in 20 normal serum. Plug, 
and keep vertical, and either incubate for three hours at 
37 C., or keep at room temperature for twelve to twenty- 
four hours ; or first incubate and then keep for twenty-four 
hours, reading the results at both stages. The result can 
be controlled by microscopic examination of the super- 
natant fluid. 

The statement of the result should comprise all the 
conditions of the experiment, namely : kind of test (hanging- 
drop or tube), dilution of serum, times of observation, and 
intensity of reaction (complete, medium, or nil agglutin- 
ation). 

The test is also given by dead bacilli. Young cultures 
are used to prevent spontaneous agglutination. It is not 
always convenient to have young cultures, and so the 
following suspension of dead bacilli (which keeps well but 
agglutinates tardily though easily), may be used : To a 
twenty-hours' broth culture, add i per cent formalin, 
incubate for two days at 37 C., pour off the fluid from 
the precipitate and store in an ice chest. 

Interpretation of Results. A positive Widal reaction 
may be due to : (i) An attack of typhoid fever (especially 
if increasing) ; (2) A previous attack ; (3) An attack of 
paratyphoid fever ; (4) Some other disease (jaundice and 
tuberculosis) . 

A negative Widal may be due to : (i) Too great or too 
little infection ; (2) Disease not typhoid ; (3) Test applied 
too early (before eighth day) ; (4) Inhibition phe- 
nomena (some sera agglutinate in a dilution i-ioo and 
not in 1-20). 



236 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

2. Grueber's Reaction. Consists in determining the 
race of a bacterium by testing it against the blood serum 
of an animal immunized to an organism of known race. 
The reaction is the converse of the Widal one, but high 
dilutions (i-iooo) must be used to avoid error due to 
group agglutinins. It is open to the fallacies that some 
bacilli are inagglutinable, though belonging undoubtedly 
to an agglutinable race (some typhoid bacilli), and bac- 
teria giving a negative result may nevertheless have 
very similar pathogenic characters to those giving a 
positive result. 

Principal Channels of Infection. Water, milk, ice-cream 
foods, oysters, mussels, water-cress, lettuces, radishes, flies, 
dust, contact, chronic germ-carriers. 

Paratyphoid Bacilli (also called paracolon bacilli) 
are the probable cause of a disease clinically resembling 
mild typhoid (about 3 per cent of cases treated as typhoid 
are probably paratyphoid). Onset is usually sudden, with 
chills ; mortality is low (2 per cent), and on post-mortem 
examination no characteristic ulceration of Peyer's patches 
is observed. Two chief varieties are described, namely, 
paratyphoid " A " and paratyphoid " B." Of these B 
is the more widely distributed in nature, and is more 
pathogenic to animals, and is believed by some to be the 
same as B. enteritidis (Aertryck) and B. typhi murium 
{mouse typhoid) . In cultures A resembles the typhosus ; 
and B the colon bacillus ; and fermentative reactions like- 
wise, except in milk, where A gives slight permanent acidity, 
and B slight acidity which after the third day gives place 
to alkalinity. Cases of illness due to A, resemble mild 
typhoid ; and to B, are allied to food-poisoning with 
severe gastro-intestinal symptoms. Organisms of this 
group form endotoxins which are heat resisting, and there- 
fore the ingestion of cooked food containing the bacilli 
may produce severe disturbance, thus relating them to 
Gaertner's bacillus (B. enteritidis). None form indol. 
Ah 1 give fluorescence with neutral-red. These bacilli are 
motile, flageUar, show agglutination phenomena, and 
ferment dextrose, dulcite and mannite, but not lactose 
nor saccharose. They are present at times with the B. 
typhosus, and may thus produce a mixed infection. 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 237 

B. Enteritidis (Gaertner). In 1888 the flesh of a 
diseased cow was sold for food in a Saxony village. Gastro- 
enteritis followed the ingestion of the meat in the case of 
fifty-seven people. One young man ate 800 grm. (nearly 
2. Ib.) of the raw meat, and died in thirty-five hours. 
From his spleen and blood Gaertner isolated an actively 
motile bacillus, closely resembling the typhoid germ ; 
and he obtained the same organism from the flesh of the 
cow. Similar bacilli have since been found in other 
outbreaks of meat-poisoning. Gaertner's bacillus is very 
pathogenic to laboratory animals, causing an intense 
haemorrhagic enteritis. The symptoms are due to endo- 
toxins which are heat resisting, so that boiling does not 
readily destroy the toxicity. It grows more rapidly on 
gelatin than B. typhosus ; forms no indol, but ferments 
dextrose, with formation of acid and gas. Closely related 
to the bacillus of Gaertner are the hog cholera bacillus 
and the B. psittacosis. The latter was first isolated 
in Paris in 1892 in a highly fatal pneumonia-like illness 
(49 cases, 16 deaths), which was traced to sick parrots 
from South America. B. icteroides and B. typhi 
murium are also of this group. Danysz's virus is. 
supposed to consist of B. enteritidis (^Ertryck and 
Gaertner). 

B. Dysenteriae, or Shiga's bacillus. First isolated 
from the stools of patients (in Japan) suffering from acute 
dysentery, in which no amoeba could be found. The 
bacillus was found by examining the stools for an organism 
which would agglutinate with the serum of the patients. 
In 36 cases one and the same organism was found to meet 
the test, and it was not found in the dejections of health} 7 
persons or persons suffering from other diseases, nor did 
it agglutinate with their blood serum. It is now recognized 
as the specific cause of acute epidemic dysentery of 
temperate climates. Since then, several bacilli have been 
isolated in different parts of the world, all related to Shiga's 
bacillus but giving a variety of reactions to carbohydrates 
and to immune serum. Kruse isolated his organism from 
" pseudo-dysentery of the insane," and Flexner from dysen- 
tery in the Philippines. They all ferment dextrose but 
without gas formation. In milk, first slight acidity and 



238 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

then increased alkalinity is produced. The Shiga-Kmse 
group produce no indol, but the Flexner group do. Short 
rod, non-motile, non-liquefying, non-Gram-staining, aerobe 
and facultative anaerobe. 

Bacillary dysentery is an ulcerative colitis with little ten- 
dency to form liver abscess. It is spread like enteric fever, 
and is a scourge of armies as it formerly was of asylums. 
Animals are easily killed by injection, but show no charac- 
teristic lesions in the intestine, though the latter have been 
obtained by feeding experiments. The Shiga-Kruse bacilli 
form a soluble toxin which is very fatal to rabbits, and is 
resistant up to 70 C. This toxin causes profuse diarrhoea, 
and later paralysis, when injected intravenously into 
rabbits, being apparently excreted by the colon and caecum. 

Similar bacilli have been isolated in the summer diarrhoea 
of infants. 

An anti-toxic serum has been prepared from horses. 

B. Fsecalis Alcaligenes resembles B. typhosus 
morphologically and culturally, but is non-pathogenic. 

Cultures. Gives a luxuriant growth on potato ; forms 
no acid with glucose, but alkali with milk whey and 
mannite. It is an occasional inhabitant of the ileum and 
colon. 

Other organisms which have been described in connection 
with the colon-typhoid-dysentery group are : B. nea- 
politanus (in a choleraic disease) ; B. acidi lactici, of 
Hueppe ; B. lactis aerogenes (resembles Friedlaender's 
diplobacillus), and other bacilli present in milk, which 
appear in the faeces of milk-fed persons. 

Voges-Proskauer Reaction is not given by B. coli 
nor by any of the above, but by B. lactis aerogenes, B. cloacae, 
and B. oxytocus perniciosus. Inoculate glucose-peptone 
solution and grow for 3 days ; add KOH ; stand for 
twenty-four hours. Red colour. 

DIFFERENTIATION OF B. TYPHOSUS FROM B. COLI. 

The problem is to find a medium which will favour the 
development of B. typhosus and B. coli and yet will 
differentiate them. The usual method is to use coloured 
media -j- inhibitory agents or favouring agents. 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 239 

1. Drigalski and Conradi's Medium. This is a meat 
broth (1-5 Ib. per litre) to which, besides the peptone and 
salt, i per cent of nutrose and 3 per cent of agar are added 
and dissolved. Thereafter litmus solution is used to 
dissolve pure lactose (quantity used = half quantity of 
agar), and the whole is added to the hot agar fluid. Render 
alkaline with sodium carbonate solution, and add a solution 
of crystal- violet. The medium must not be overheated or 
the lactose may be changed. It is a solid medium and is, 
shortly, a lactose-nutrose-agar. 

The crystal-violet restrains the saprophytes. In 
twenty-four hours B. coli colonies are red ; 2 to 6 mm. in 
diameter, and non-transparent. B. typhosus colonies are 
blue ; 2 mm. in diameter, and glassy and dew-like. 

The plates are inoculated by smearing the surface with 
a glass rod, dipped in, say, diluted faeces. 

2. Endo's Medium. This is a 3 per cent agar neutralized 
and then alkalinized with NaOH, and lactose and fuchsin 
(basic) solution added, and then Na 2 SO 3 solution until 
decolorized. Put into test tubes (15 c.c.), sterilize, and 
keep in dark. When using, pour plates, and inoculate by 
surface smears, when in twenty-four hours B. coli colonies 
are red, and B. typhosus colonies are colourless. 

3. Loeffler's Medium. This is a 3 per cent agar to which 
malachite-green is added, and this retards growth of B. 
coli. B. typhosus colonies are minute glistening points ; 
later, they colour agar yellow. 

4- Hoffman and Picker's Medium. Convert water sample 
into medium by adding : caffein 2-5 per cent (restrains 
B. coli) ; nutrose i per cent ; and crystal-violet o-ooi per 
cent (restrains saprophytes). Incubate at 37 C. for not 
more than 12 hours. The B. typhosus can then be isolated 
on plate media. 

5. MacConkey's Media Have been already described on 
page 153. The bile-salt assists growth of B. coli and 
B. typhosus, and hinders others. Where neutral-red is 
used, acid formation changes it to a rose-red. 

6. Bile Medium (for blood).

CAPSULATED BACILLI. 

In this group are classed bacilli which are non-motile, 
and capsulated in certain cultures, but otherwise resemble 
the Bacillus coli. 

Bacillus Pneumoniae. Otherwise called pneumo- 
bacillus, Friedlaender's bacillus. Was first described by 
Friedlaender in 1882 as the cause of acute lobar pneumonia. 
It was first called a micrococcus, and was confused with 
Fraenkel's pneumococcus, but was later recognized as a 
short bacillus. It is the cause of pneumonia in about 
7 per cent of the cases. It is taken as the type of a group, 
" the mucosus capsulatus " group, and is also called B. 
mucosus capsulatus. 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 241 

Characteristics. A short plump bacillus with rounded 
ends, but showing some very long forms (0-6 to 5 micra long 
by 0-5 to 1-5 micron). The short thick forms are mostly 
found in animal tissues, and at times are almost coccoid. 
In sputum it shows a capsule, and in other preparations 
from the body. It occurs in pairs, and hence has been 
called a diplobacillus. It may also form short chains. 
It is non-motile, non-flagellar, non-sporing, non-gelatin- 
liquefying, and non-Gram (i.e., Gram-negative). 

Cultures. It grows readily on ordinary media and in 
gelatin at room temperature. It grows well on acid or 
alkaline media, is aerobic, and facultatively anaerobic. 

In broth : rapid abundant growth with a pellicle, general 
clouding, and later a stringy sediment. 

On agar : sticky mucus-like colonies of a greyish-white 
colour. 

In gelatin stab : a white line of growth at first, but with 
increasing growth at surface a " nail-head " appearance 
is produced. This was at one time thought to be peculiar 
to Friedlaender's bacillus. 

On potato : abundant, somewhat brownish growth. 

In peptone water : no indol formation. 

In milk : abundant growth with capsule formation. 
Acid and clot are slowly formed. 

Pathogenicity. For man : pneumonia of a severe and 
fatal type ; ulcerative stomatitis and nasal catarrh ; 
acute tonsillitis ; in antral suppurations and in foetid 
coryza ; and, on rare occasions, in septicaemia. 

For animals : a mouse injected at the root of the tail 
dies in two days of septicaemia. It is also pathogenic for 
guinea-pigs ; less so for rabbits.

capsulatus ; bacillus of rhinoscleroma. Both these 
bacilli differ only in not fermenting dextrose. 

B, Lactis Aerogenes Is a widely distributed organism, 
and was isolated by Escherich in 1885 from the faeces of 
infants. It is almost constantly present in milk, faeces, 
sewage, and water. It differs from B. coli, which is found 
in like circumstances, in being non-motile and non- 
flagellar, in possessing a capsule in milk cultures, in 
fermenting saccharose and starch but not dulcite ; and 
in not forming indol. 

Cultures. It grows readily on all media. 

In broth, it forms a pellicle, and causes general clouding. 

On agar and gelatin, it forms a heavy white growth. 

In gelatin stab, it gives a nail-head growth. 

On potato, it grows well and forms gas from the starch. 

In Milk, acid formation and coagulation are rapid. The 
clot is not digested by the bacillus, and in ordinary souring 
of milk the germs present which produce proteolytic 
ferments have their growth restrained by the large amount 
of lactic acid formed by the more rapid action of B. 
lactis aerogenes. It is scarcely pathogenic, though 
flatulence in infants has been attributed to its action, 
and a cystitis in which gas was formed in the bladder, 
associated with an acid urine. For animals, its patho- 
genicity is not properly established, the reports being 
contradictory. It is an aerobe, but a facultative anaerobe. 
Optimum temperature, 25 to 30 C. B. lactis aerogenes 
is distinguished from Friedlaender's bacillus by its invari- 
able and rapid curdling of milk; but some authorities 
consider it to be identical with that organism.

This bacillus is present in milk, which it curdles and 
acidifies. It does not ferment saccharose or dulcite. 

B. acidi lactici (Leichmann) is believed to be really a 
streptococcus, the Streptococcus lacticus (Kruse), which 
Heinemann states is a variety of the Streptococcus pyo- 
genes. It is present on the cow's hide, in cow dung, and 
in milk from the first stage of milking. 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 243 

MINUTE BACILLI. 

Under this heading may be conveniently grouped the 
bacilli, of influenza, of acute epidemic conjunctivitis, and 
of whooping-cough. All are Gram-negative. 

Bacillus Influenzae Was first described in 1892 by 
several observers, and has been called after one of them 
the Pfeiffer bacillus. It is very small even among micro- 
organisms, being only from 0-5 to 1-2 micron long by 0-2 to 
0-4 micron thick. A tubercle bacillus, 3 micra by 0-3 
micron is thus equal in length to several (3 to 6) influenza 
bacilli placed end to end. 

It is then a small bacillus, of irregular length, having 
rounded ends, rarely forming chains, non-motile, non- 
sporing, Gram-negative, and not growing on gelatin or at 
room temperatures. It is not easily stained with the usual 
dyes ; best with 10 per cent aqueous fuchsin, or Loeffler's 
methylene-blue, 5 minutes of either. The bacilli form 
irregular clusters ; occasionally polar staining is noticed. 

Cultures. It is not easily cultivated, growing only in 
the presence of haemoglobin. This is obtained on the 
ordinary media by smearing them with some blood drawn 
from the finger, or by mixing melted agar with fresh blood. 
The blood of the pigeon may be used. The medium is 
inoculated w r ith the sputum coughed up from the bronchi, 
avoiding mucus from the mouth. Colonies appear in 18 
to 24 hours, as minute transparent drops, colourless, and 
likened to drops of dew. Growth ceases in 2 to 3 days. 
Frequent subculturing and storage at room temperature 
are needed to keep the cultures alive. 

It is aerobic, and shows no growth under strict anaero- 
biosis. It is readily killed at 60 C. ; and by drying, in 
a few hours. Dies in culture media within a week. Its 
usual habitat during an epidemic is the nasal passages 
and bronchial tubes. It is said to remain in these 
places after recovery from the attack, and to persist for 
years. The immunity produced by an attack of influenza 
is very short. A pseudo-bacillus, differing only in its 
slightly larger size and its growth in threads, and showing 
involution forms, has been described, but its differentiation 
is doubtful. 



244 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Koch-Weeks Bacillus. A bacillus similar to the 
above, but longer and more slender, was described by 
Koch in 1883, and by Weeks in 1887, in connection with an 
epidemic form of acute conjunctivitis. 

Cultures. It grows best on serum agar, and at 37 C ; 
the colonies appear in 36 hours as dew drops. 

The disease is characterized by a muco-purulent discharge, 
hyperaemia of the whole of the conjunctiva, and swelling 
of the lymph follicles of the lids, which show through 
the palpebral conjunctiva as slightly raised pinkish-grey 
bodies, a half to one millimetre in diameter. A film made 
from the discharge and stained with Loeffler's methylene- 
blue, shows the bacilli. The affection is very contagious, 
and to prevent epidemics in schools, common face-towels 
should be rigorously prohibited. 

Bordet-Gengou Bacillus. These observers found 
a small ovoid bacillus in the sputum of a child suffering 
from whooping-cough. 

Culture. In 1906, six years later, they succeeded in 
cultivating it on a special medium, after failing with 
ascitic agar and blood agar. This medium is a glycerin 
extract of potato with 4 per cent salt and 2-5 per cent 
agar, to which is added an equal quantity of defibrinated 
human or rabbit's blood. On this, inoculated from 
sputum, the colonies appear within 48 hours, and are small, 
greyish, and rather thick. In subcultures, they give 
a more luxuriant growth, and can then be grown on blood 
agar and in ascitic broth, in which it causes a viscid 
sediment but no pellicle. It is strictly aerobic, and grows 
moderately below blood-heat. It remains alive in culture for 
as long as two months. Specific agglutinins are developed 
in immunized animals, which serve to distinguish it from 
B. influenzae. The washed and dried bacilli ground in a 
mortar and injected into a rabbit intravenously, usually 
kill it in 24 hours. Specific complement fixation has 
been used by Bordet and Gengou to prove the identity of 
the bacillus, using the serum of an infant suffering from 
whooping-cough. 

The organism is present in the sputum in the early 
stages in predominating numbers, but later it is 
swamped by others. It is scattered among the pus cells, 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 245 

and at times is intracellular. It is extremely small and 
ovoid, so that it is readily mistaken for a micrococcus. 
It is slightly larger than the bacillus of influenza, and 
more ovoid. It is Gram-negative, stains with Loemer's 
methylene-blue, dilute carbol-fuchsin, or aqueous fuchsin. 
Toluidin blue in a special medium is advised. (Toluidin 
blue 5 grm., alcohol 100 c.c., water 500 c.c. ; dissolve ; 
add of 5 per cent aqueous carbolic acid solution, 50 c.c. ; 
stand two days ; filter.) 

Bacillus of Ducrey Is a small bacillus (i to 2 micra 
X 0-5 micron), regularly found in soft chancre or chancroid. 
It is non-motile, non-flagellar, non-sporing, Gram-negative, 
and is found at times inside the leucocytes. 

Culture. It only grows on whole blood agar, and dies 
off at room temperatures. Colonies show in about 48 
hours. Inoculation of pure cultures on the skin produces 
typical chancres in 4 to 6 days. 

Zur Nedden's Bacillus. A small slightly curved 
bacillus (i micron long) which has been isolated in ulcera- 
tive conditions of the cornea. It grows well on the 
ordinary media. It is non-motile, Gram-negative, and 
does not liquefy gelatin. It clots milk, forms acid with 
glucose, but no indol in peptone water. 

Culture. It grows well on potato. 

MORAX-AXENFELD DIPLO-BACILLUS. 

This is a short, thick bacillus with rounded ends, found 
in a chronic eye condition called " angular conjunctivitis," 
in which there is slight redness of the edges of the lids, 
especially at the angles. The ocular conjunctiva is seldom 
affected. It mainly affects adults, and chiefly women. 
There is rarely any corneal trouble. It was described by 
Morax in 1896, and by Axenfeld a year later. The diag- 
nosis is easily made, by taking a smear of the small bead 
of pus which gathers through the night at the angles, and 
staining with the usual dyes. The bacillus is easily stained, 
and is Gram-negative. In stained films, short and long 
chains of polar stained bacilli are seen. 

Culture. It grows best on Loeffler's blood serum at 
37 C., causing small pits of liquefaction in 48 hours. 



246 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 
DIPHTHERIA BACILLUS. 

Klebs first described the bacillus in the throat mem- 
brane in 1883, and Loeffler first cultivated it in 1884 ; 
hence called the Klebs-LoefHer bacillus. The toxins pro- 
duced by it were investigated by Roux and Yersin in 1888- 
89, and the antitoxins by Behring and Kitasato in 1890. 

Description. A slender bacillus, i to 6 micra long and 
0-3 to i-i micron broad. From the throat they are mostly 
4 to 5 micra long. They are rarely of uniform thickness 
throughout, showing club-shaped thickening at one or both 
ends. They are straight or slightly curved, stain deeply 
with methylene-blue, often showing granules more darkly 
stained, so that a dotted, beaded, or striped or barred 
appearance results. The longer individuals often have 
a strong resemblance to short chains of streptococci. In 
i8-hour-old cultures, many of the bacilli show on staining 
deeply stained oval bodies situated most frequently at the 
ends, the so-called " polar " or " Babe"s-Ernst " bodies. 
These were first regarded as spores, but are now considered 
to be chromatic granules. B. diphtherias is an aerobe. Is 
non-motile, non-sporing, non-flagellar, and non-liquefying 
of gelatin. It is Gram-positive. 

Cultures. Grows on all media, but quickest and most 
characteristically on Loeffler's blood serum : [beef-blood 
serum, 3 parts, i per cent glucose broth (meat infusion), 
i part. Put in tubes, slant, coagulate at 70 C., and 
sterilize at 57 C. for i hour on eight days.] On this 
medium colonies form in from 12 to 24 hours at 37 C., as 
small circular discs of opaque whitish colour, like candle- 
grease spots, and enlarging rapidly, outstrip any accom- 
panying colonies of streptococci. 

On agar, a similar growth occurs, but less quickly, and 
is closely resembled by that of Streptococcus pyogenes. 

In broth, a pellicle may form, and a turbidity which 
however soon settles to the bottom, leaving the fluid clear 
and producing a powdery deposit. 

It grows well in milk but does not clot it. 

Does not form indol. Ferments glucose, galactose, 
laevulose, maltose, and glycerin, but not mannite or 
saccharose. It reduces nitrate to nitrite. 



XON-SPORING BACILLI 247 

Grows best at 37 C. ; growth at 22 C., but not at 
20 C. 

Isolation. Take sterile swab, nib on throat, then rub over 
serum in tube, and incubate for 18 to 24 hours at 37 C. 
Take platinum loop and rake all over surface of serum, 
and then make a film and stain with Loemer's methylene- 
blue or Neisser. Distinguish from Hoffmann's bacillus, 
which is shorter and plumper, does not produce acid in 
glucose, is non-pathogenic to guinea-pigs, and does not show 
granules with Neisser. (B. diphtherias at times does not 
give Neisser, and occasionally pseudo-B. diphtherias does 
stain with Neisser.) The only sure method of differentia- 
tion is toxicity of culture ; guinea-pig killed in 24 to 48 to 
72 hours by injection of toxin of true B. diphtherias. 

In the serum-water medium of Hiss, plus I per cent of 
glucose, laevulose, galactose, maltose, lactose, saccharose, 
mannite and dextrin, B. diphtheriae produces acid in all 
except with mannite, lactose, and saccharose ; B. xerosis 
produces acid with all except mannite, lactose, and dextrin ; 
B. Hoffmanni does not produce acid with any. 

The saccharose and dextrin media therefore serve to 
differentiate : B. diphtheria, acid with dextrin, not with 
saccharose ; B. xerosis, acid with saccharose, not with 
dextrin ; B. Hoffmanni, acid with neither. 

In Vincent's angina, B. fusiformis is found : an anaerobe, 
Gram-negative, longish, and swollen in the middle. 

B. xerosis is found in the conjunctiva, and is practically 
identical with the B. diphtherias : it is non-pathogenic to 
animals ; produces no toxin ; does not form acid with 
glucose, but ferments saccharose. 

Habitat. Mucous surfaces, mouth, throat, nose, con- 
junctiva, larynx, middle ear, vagina. 

Thermal Death-Point. Forty-five minutes at 55 C., 
(moist heat) ; dry membrane, i hour at 98 C. 

Resistance. Lives six to eight weeks on agar, five to six 
months on serum, twelve to fifteen months on dextrose 
serum. In dried membrane retains vitality for months. 

Pathogenicity. -Guinea-pigs die in from two to three 
days after subcutaneous injection of young broth culture. 
Nephritis and paralysis are observed, but the characteristic 
feature is enlarged and haemorrhagic condition of the 



248 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

adrenals. ' Cats, dogs, and pigeons are very susceptible to 
mucus infection ; rats and mice are refractory. 

A guinea-pig killed by the injection of a virulent culture 
of diphtheria bacillus shows congestion of all the organs, 
especially severe in the suprarenals. 

Toxins. Diphtheria toxin is an extracellular one, that 
is, it is soluble in the liquid media, and can be obtained 
separate from the bacillus by nitration through a Chamber- 
land tube. Toxin formation is best got in meat -infusion 
broth with added peptones, and rendered alkaline, after 
two to three weeks' growth at 37-5 C. A free supply of 
oxygen is important to secure the greatest toxin formation. 

The toxin is readily destroyed by bright light, by 
exposure in a liquid solution to 60 C., or if in dry state 
to a temperature over 70 C. Sealed and kept in the dark 
and in the cold, it may be kept for long periods. It is 
believed to be closely allied to the albumoses. 

Antitoxin. The mode of preparation and standardiza- 
tion is described under ANTITOXIC SERA (page 189). The 
value of antitoxin in the treatment of diphtheria is now 
well attested. The results are better the earlier the injec- 
tion, so that few deaths occur in those injected within 
twenty-four hours of the onset, the rate gradually rising 
until by the fifth day the effect is slight. The dose 
given is not proportionate to the age, but to the severity 
of the attack and the time that has elapsed before 
coming under treatment. 2000 to 8000 units should be 
given to children on these principles, and up to 50,000 
units have been given in one case. In large doses, it is 
better to give the higher-potency sera, in which 10,000 
units can be had in 10 c.c. of serum. In about one-third 
of the cases injected, serum sickness or serum disease is 
noted. The symptoms are : an erythematous rash and 
fever coming on in a week to ten days after the injection. 
At times general pains and even arthritis may be present. 
These symptoms are more likely to be produced by large 
doses of serum. But more alarming symptoms than these 
occur soon after the injection, as has been referred to 
under ANAPHYLAXIS (page 212). On analysis these cases 
are found to occur in people who have not been previously 
injected, and in people who have had a previous injection 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 249 

more than the incubation period of the serum disease 
(that is, ten to twelve days) before. On account of these 
facts, Goodall advises that prophylactic doses of diphtheria 
antitoxin should not be given to anyone without discrimina- 
tion, and never to a person the subject of asthma (see 
page 213) . In an actual attack of diphtheria in such a person 
the risk would have to be definitely considered, and a 
judgment come to on the relative dangers of the attack 
and the use of the antitoxin. In those who have had a 
previous dose, either for an attack or for prophylaxis, some 
time antecedent, one should be on the outlook for alarming 
symptoms if a second dose is being given. It is stated 
that so far no death has been recorded in these 
circumstances, which is to some extent reassuring. This 
class of case suggests the avoidance of prophylactic doses 
altogether, as if the person takes an attack more than 
ten days later, he is sensibilized to the now required 
injection. (See for further details, articles by Goodall in 
Public Health, January, 1911, and in Encyclopedia Medica ; 
and by Currie, Journal of Hygiene, January, 1907. Also 
annotation in Lancet, 1911, vol. i, page 1654.) 

Antitoxic serum keeps well in a cool, dark place. 
Anderson has found that at 20 C. the average yearly loss 
of potency is 20 per cent ; at 15 C.. it is about 10 per cent ; 
and at 5 C., it is only about 6 per cent. Dried, and kept 
at 5 C., its potency was practically unimpaired after 5-5 
years. The addition of chloroform, tricresol, etc., to 
preserve, had no influence apparently on the rate of 
deterioration. 



250 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

BACILLUS MALLEI. 

The B. mallei is the bacillus of glanders, a disease of 
horses, mules, and asses. Horned cattle are quite immune, 
whilst goats and sheep are intermediate in susceptibility. 
Guinea-pigs and rabbits can be infected by inoculation, but 
rats are immune. 

It was first obtained in pure culture and accurately 
studied by Loeffler and Schuetz in 1882, and from the 
human subject by Weichselbaum in 1885. 

Description. B. mallei is a medium-sized rod (3 to 4 
micra x 0-5 to 0-75 micron), straight or slightly curved, 
usually with rounded ends. It is about the same length as 
the tubercle bacillus, but distinctly thicker. These bacilli 
show considerable variations in size, even in the same 
culture ; and this is characteristic. They are non-motile, 
non-flagellar, non-sporing, and Gram-negative. They 
usually appear as single bacilli ; on rare occasions short 
filamentous forms occur. 

Staining.- The bacilli stain rather easily, but are as easily 
decolorized. The best results are got by staining with a 
mordant present, and simply washing in water, and 
drying ; in the case of tissues, dehydrating by the aniline- 
oil method. Carbol-fuchsin and carbol-thionin-blue make 
good stains. Loeffler's methylene-blue, followed by slight 
decolorization in weak acetic acid, and then fifteen minutes 
in saturated solution of tannic acid, wash, dry, and mount, 
gives good results. As a counter-stain, I per cent acid 
fuchsin for half a minute may be used. With methylene- 
blue, the bacilli stain irregularly ; granular, deeply staining 
areas alternating with unstained or faintly-stained portions. 
This has been ascribed to degeneration, and to preparation 
towards spore formation. It is probably a peculiarity of 
the cell protoplasm. 

Cultures. Grows well on all media at 35 to 37 C., 
indifferent to moderate degrees of acid or alkali. Glycerin 
or glucose render the media even more favourable. 

On agar and on glycerin-agar : the growth is greyish 
white to yellow. 

On gelatin : growth is slow, and greyish-white ; no lique- 
faction takes place. 



XOX-SPORING BACILLI 251 

In broth : diffuse clouding ; later, a heavy, tough, slimy 
sediment forms, and the broth becomes brown. 

In milk : coagulation takes place slowly, with slight acid 
formation. 

On potato : the growth at 37 C. is characteristic. Growth 
is rapid and abundant, and in forty-eight hours forms a 
transparent layer over the whole surface, and of a yellowish 
tint, like clear honey. The growth gets darker and more 
opaque, and on the eighth day it is reddish-brown or 
chocolate in colour, and at the edge the potato is stained 
a greenish-yellow colour. Spirilla cholerse and Metchni- 
kovi, and B. pyocyaneus give similar cultures. 

Resistance. Killed by one hour at 75 C. or two hours 
at 60 C. In the dark, in sealed tubes and on artificial 
media, it may remain alive for years. In watering-troughs, 
it has been found after seventy days. Complete drying 
kills it in a short time ; carbolic i per cent, in 30 min. ; 
corrosive sublimate o-i per cent, in 15 min. 

Pathogenicity. Notable for horses, mules, asses, cats, 
dogs, guinea-pigs, rabbits, and field mice. Non-sus- 
ceptible animals are : cattle, pigs, birds, rats, house mice, 
and white mice. In the horse, the disease takes two forms. 
When affecting the superficial lymphatic glands, it is called 
"farcy ; " when affecting the nasal mucous membrane it 
is called " glanders," and is a much more serious disease. 
In glanders the course may be acute or chronic. In the 
acute form, chill is followed by general high temperature, 
and in a few days the nasal mucous membrane is studded 
with nodules, there is profuse nasal discharge, and later, 
ulceration of the nodules and swelling of the corresponding 
glands, and these also tend to break down. Finally the 
lungs are involved, and death takes place in from one to 
four weeks. In the chronic form, the onset is more gradual, 
the nasal swelling being accompanied by subcutaneous 
swellings all over the body, some of which tend to break 
down and ulcerate. These swellings are the so-called 
" farcy buds," and may persist for years. 

In man, the onset is usually violent, with fever and 
general symptoms; and most cases terminate fatally 
within two to three weeks, sometimes within a few days. 
The infection is usually by a wound, which is followed by 



252 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

lymphangitis, and then a general infection resembling a 
pyaemia. As in the horse, the nasal mucosa tends to 
become affected. At times the course is more chronic. 

In the horse, the infection is usually by the mucous 
membrane of the nose or mouth, by wounds, or at times 
by the alimentary canal. 

Toxin. No soluble toxin is described, but a concentrated 
three-weeks' culture in glycerin broth, sterilized by heat 
and filtered, is used as a diagnostic agent under the name 
of mallein (fluid). Dry mallein has been prepared by 
filtering a broth culture, concentrating filtrate on a water- 
bath to one-tenth of its bulk, and precipitating with 
thirty times its bulk of alcohol. Mallein differs from many 
other bacterial extracts in being extremely resistant to 
heat and storage without loss of strength ; 120 C. has no 
destructive effect on it. 

Diagnosis of Glanders. Three tests are used, namely : 
(i) Guinea-pig inoculation ; (2) Mallein test ; (3) Agglu- 
tination test. 

1. Inoculation of a Guinea-pig. A male guinea-pig is 
injected intraperitoneally with fragments of the diseased 
tissue, scrapings from ulcers, or nasal discharge of the 
suspected animal. 

A positive reaction is shown by the testicles becom- 
ing red and swollen usually on the second or third day, 
due to inflammation of the tunica vaginalis. Severe 
general symptoms follow, and death occurs in twelve to 
fifteen days. Greyish nodules are found in the spleen and 
other organs. The test is not absolutely specific, but is 
useful when other tests are inapplicable. A culture on 
potato of the pus from the tunica vaginalis should be 
made. 

2. Mallein Test. A proper dose of mallein is infected 
subcutaneously into the breast or neck of the suspected 
animal. It is advissd to inject a dose into a control 
animal. The temperature of the animal should be taken 
at least three times a day for one or two days before 
injection. The injection is made at 6.0 to 7.0 a.m., and 
the reaction will be at its height at or before 10 p.m. of the 
same day. The temperature is taken every two hours 
after the injection for at least eighteen hours. On the 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 253 

succeeding day take the temperature at least three times. 
In a healthy animal free from glanders, a local swelling, not 
exceeding 3 inches in diameter, is produced at the seat 
of inoculation, and a rise of temperature not exceeding 
i C. (1-8 F.) ; and both swelling and temperature have 
much subsided in twenty-four hours. In a horse suffering 
from glanders, there appears within a few hours a firm, hot, 
diffuse swelling, which reaches a maximum size in twenty- 
four hours, is intensely tender during that time, and lasts 
from three to nine days. The size of the swelling reaches at 
least 5 inches in diameter. The temperature rises in six to 
eight hours 1-5 to 2 C. (2-7 to 3-6 F.), reaching 104 to 
1 06 F. The high temperature continues for eight to ten 
hours (maximum about ten to sixteen hours after 
injection), and then gradually falls, but is distinctly above 
normal on the following day. This reaction is specific. 

3. Agglutination Test. The macroscopic or sedimentation 
method in high dilutions (i-iooo) is preferred. Normal 
horse serum may react in 1-500. 

Immunity. An attack of glanders does not confer 
immunity. Artificial active immunization has been 
attempted but has so far failed. 

Nodules. The nodules found in glanders show more 
leucocytic infiltration and less proliferative change towards 
formation of epitheloid ceUs than does tubercle. 

Prevention. The Glanders or Far Order of 1907, 
issued by the Board of Agriculture, (i) Lays down com- 
pulsory notification of actual or suspected disease ; 
(2) Empowers local authority to slaughter at once any 
diseased horse, ass, or mule ; (3) Enables local authority 
to test suspected animals with mallein, and deal with 
contacts. 



254 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

BACILLUS PESTIS. 

This plague bacillus belongs to a group of bacilli which 
are all highly pathogenic to the animal world, and produce 
in them a haemorrhagic septicaemia. The bacilli now 
usually classed in this group are : the bacillus of human 
plague, of swine plague, of chicken cholera, of septic pleuro- 
pneumonia in cattle, and of rabbit septicaemia. The group 
characteristics are : short, plump, non-motile bacilli ; non- 
flagellar ; non-sporing ; Gram-negative ; non-gelatin-liquefy- 
ing ; strongly aerobic, growing readily on simple media, 
easily stained but showing a marked tendency to stain 
more deeply at the ends than at the centre (bipolar 
staining). They are believed by some to be varieties of 
one organism. 

Plague is a specific, infective disease, caused by 
the B. pestis, and characterized by inflammation of the 
lymphatic glands (buboes), carbuncles, pneumonia, and 
often haemorrhages (Osier). In the past the plague has 
occurred in tremendous epidemics, and even to-day in 
India it proves a terrible scourge. The large and extremely 
fatal epidemic of pneumonic plague in China in 1910-11 
shows that it still has very pathogenic powers for mankind. 

In the sixth century, in the reign of Justinian, Emperor 
of Rome, half the population of the Roman Empire 
perished of the disease. In the fourteenth century 
the " black death " overran Europe and destroyed 
25,000,000, or about one-fourth of the population. In the 
seventeenth century it raged virulently, and in London 
alone, in 1665, about 70,000 people died. During the 
eighteenth and nineteenth centuries its ravages lessened. 

In 1893 an outbreak appeared at Hong-Kong, and since 
then the disease has occurred in many parts of the world, 
notably in India since 1896, in Egypt, in South Africa, 
and in several Mediterranean ports, and, after an absence 
from Great Britain of over two hundred years, it 
obtained a foothold in Glasgow in 1900. It reached New 
York quarantine station in 1899, and in San Francisco 
broke out in 1900, continuing until 1904. In Australia, 
cases appeared at Sydney and other ports. In the county 
of Suffolk, in England, an epidemic ot rat plague, associated 



NON-SPORIXG BACILLI 255 

with a limited outbreak of pneumonic plague in man, was 
(September, 1910) the occasion of considerable anxiety and 
of increased vigilance and action. In California the last 
case of plague was noted in 1909, but an epizootic of plague 
among squirrels, causing thousands of deaths among these 
animals, was only reported as quiescing in 1911. 

In 1894, Kitasato and Yersin independently discovered 
the bacillus in large numbers in the buboes, cultivated it 
in pure growth, and reproduced the disease in susceptible 
animals by inoculation, and from them recovered the 
bacillus. The proof in the human subject was given 
later, when by an accidental infection a physician and a 
nurse died of plague. 

Description. B. pestis is a short thick bacillus with 
well-rounded ends, thus appearing as a small oval rod, 
two to three times in length what it is in breadth (1-5 
to 1-75 X 0-5 to 0-7). The bacilli appear singly, though 
at times in pairs, and in fluid cultures in chains. In 
young cultures they show marked variations in size, and 
less polar staining. In old cultures, involution forms 
appear, as swollen coccoid forms, or as longer club-shaped 
diphtheroid forms. In the tissues they are sometimes found 
to possess a capsule. They stain readily with all the 
usual aniline dyes, dilute aqueous fuchsin and methylene- 
blue having been mostly used, and these show the polar 
staining well. Special polar stains have been devised. 
Involution forms are developed more rapidly when NaCl 
is added to the medium, and " salt agar " containing 2 to 5 
per cent of NaCl is used for diagnostic purposes, the 
bacilli showing the usual shape on plain agar, on salt 
agar exhibiting coccoid, root-shaped, large, globular, and 
sausage-shaped forms, when the higher percentage is used ; 
with the lower percentage, the most striking feature is a 
general enlargement of all the bacilli. 

Dr. R. M. Buchanan, city bacteriologist of Glasgow, 
in a Report to the Local Government Board for 
Scotland ("Thirteenth Annual Report of the L.G.B., 
Scotland, 1907," page 81), describes a new culture

instead of ox flesh in the preparation of a nutrient 
medium for the growth of Bacillus pestis. An extract 
is made from the carcases of rats deprived of skin, 
head, stomach, and intestines, and the further preparation 
of the medium is essentially the same as in that of ordinary 
agar, except that the extract is boiled for half an hour 
before straining. Rat agar has been used in the (city) 
laboratory for a number of years as a culture medium 
for Bacillus pestis, with most satisfactory results, growth 
taking place on this medium with much greater certainty, 
rapidity, and profusion than on glycerin agar. It is also 
noteworthy that on this medium the bacillus closely 
approximates to the form which it assumes in the body, 
and is sometimes much elongated. In this elongated 
form it may be difficult to recognize, so different is it from 
the familiar cocco-bacillary growth of glycerin agar." 

B. pestis is Gram-negative, non-gelatin-liquefying, non- 
motile, non-sporing, and non-indol forming. 

Cultures. Grows readily and luxuriantly on all the 
meat-infusion media. The optimum temperature is 30 C., 
while below 20 C. and above 38 C. the growth is sparse 
and delayed. The best reaction is neutrality or slight 
alkalinity ; but acidity does not prevent growth. 

On agar : growth appears in twenty-four hours as minute 
colonies, whitish and compact in centre, and showing to 
hand lens a broad, irregular, indented, granular margin. 
Kept for a few days at room temperature, some colonies 
grow faster than others and become more opaque, almost 
suggesting a mixed growth (Muir and Ritchie). 

On gelatin : a similar growth occurs in two to three days. 
In stab, a white line of growth takes place along the 
needle track, and little or no surface growth. 

In broth : growth is slow, and usually forms a slightly 
granular or powdery deposit at the foot or sides of the tube 
or flask. If the surface is covered with " ghee " (in India, 
butter clarified by boiling, and thus converted into a kind 
of oil), delicate threads of growth extend from the surface 
downwards, the so-called " stalactite " growth, which 
however is not specific to the plague bacillus, nor is it 
shown by all races of the organism. To observe it, the 
culture must be kept absolutely at rest. 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 257 

Milk is not coagulated. Litmus milk shows slight acid 
formation. Growth on potato and blood serum shows 
nothing of differential value. 

In peptone water, no indol is formed. 

Resistance. Readily killed by heat, like all non-sporing 
forms ; ten minutes at 65 C., or one hour at 58 C. Drying 
kills them in six to eight days ; artificial drying in four 
to five hours. May live in pus or sputum for eight to 
fourteen days. In a moist dark place, may retain 
viability for months or even years. Freezing has little 
effect, bacilli surviving a temperature below o C. for 
forty days. Direct sunlight kills them in four to five hours ; 
carbolic i per cent in two hours, 5 per cent in ten minutes ; 
perchloride of mercury i-iooo in ten minutes. 

Pathogenicity. For man, very pathogenic. For animals, 
very marked for rats, mice, guinea-pigs, rabbits, and 
monkeys. In rats and guinea-pigs, the mere rubbing of 
plague bacilli into the skin will often produce the disease, 
and this fact is made use of in isolating the bacillus from 
material contaminated with other bacteria. Animal 
passage increases virulence ; growth on artificial media 
diminishes it, when prolonged. After subcutaneous injec- 
tion, a local inflammatory swelling follows ; then a swelling 
of the corresponding lymphatic glands ; thereafter a 
general infection. Mice usually die in one to three days, 
rats and guinea-pigs in two to five days, and rabbits in 
four to seven days. Post mortem, the chief changes are : 
the enlarged glands, congestion of the organs (sometimes 
with haemorrhages), and enlargement of the spleen. The 
bacilli are numerous in the lymphatic glands, usually in 
the spleen, and throughout the blood. The blood of a 
plague-stricken rat may contain as many as 100 million 
bacilli per c.c. 

Transmission. Actual contact plays a very minor part 
in the transmission of the disease, as the virus is not given 
off by the skin. The chief modes of transmission are two 
in number, by : (i) Inoculation by biting insects (Limond, 
1899), the usual insect being the rat flea (Pulex cheopis) ; 
(2) Inhalation : this is the mode of spread of the pneu- 
monic form of plague. 

i. By inoculation by biting we get the bubonic plague, 

17 



258 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

the course of which corresponds exactly to that induced 
in animals by subcutaneous injection, as described above. 
An outbreak of bubonic plague is always preceded by an 
increased death-rate among rats, and that from a disease 
now known to be due to the B. pestis. The rat flea becomes 
infected by sucking the blood of the rat, and infects other 
rats, or it may be human beings. It is now believed that 
the flea does not inject the bacillus when biting, as no 
bacilli have been found in its biting apparatus. It is 
therefore surmised that the mode of infection is by the 
inoculation of the biting wound by the rubbing in of the 
excreta and vomit of the flea, both of which are highly 
charged with B. pestis. The proof that B. pestis multiplies 
in the stomach of the flea is held to follow from the fact 
that abundant bacilli may be found in it up to twelve days 
or longer. It has also been observed that in India plague 
does not maintain itself in epidemic form after the mean 
temperature has risen above 80 to 85 F. (26-6 to 29-4 
C.). This has been found to be associated with a rapid 
disappearance of the bacilli from the alimentary canal of 
infected fleas during the prevalence of this higher tempera- 
ture. Transmission by inoculation must be extended to 
the infection of attendants on the sick and others, by 
the rubbing in of soiled linen, etc., and also from earth 
soiled by the excreta, vomit, and sputum of rats dead or 
dying of bubonic or pneumonic plague. Such transmission 
is urged by some as a likely one in the case of barefoot 
peoples, living in dwellings with earth floors and infested 
with rats. The transmission from rat to rat is believed 
to be by the flea, in which case the buboes are mainly 
cervical ; and by ingestion of rats dead of plague by 
other rats, when the buboes are mesenteric. 

The subject of transmission in this manner has been 
mainly studied in India. In Bombay there are two kinds 
of rats : (i) Mus decumanus, and (2) Mus rattus. Both 
kinds are infested by the same flea, the Pulex cheopis. The 
Mus decumanus is the large brown rat, and is the same 
species as that present in Suffolk, England, to-day. The 
Mus rattus is the black rat, and is identical with the English 
black rat. These two species of rats differ fundamentally 
in their habits. The Mus decumanus is a timid rat, which 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 259 

| 

avoids man as far as possible, and finds its food in sewers, 
ditches, fields, etc., rather than in inhabited houses. 
Mus rattus, on the other hand, is a domestic animal in 
India, and lives in close and intimate association with the 
home-life of the people. The Mus rattus, therefore, is 
chiefly responsible for the transmission of the disease to 
man ; while the Mus decumanus is of special importance 
in maintaining the disease from season to season. The 
Indian Plague Commission conclude that plague is a rat 
disease, having a regular periodicity, namely (a) an epizootic 
season, from December to May inclusive, and (b) a non- 
epizootic season, from June to November inclusive. 
During the latter period there are few cases of plague in 
rats, fleas are scanty (this is given as a cause of the decrease 
in cases of plague in rats), and in some villages where the 
Mus rattus alone prevails, plague may actually die out 
each season. The Mus decumanus is more infested with 
fleas, and is thought to keep the infection going from 
season to season. A fresh epizootic first chiefly affects the 
Mus decumanus, then spreads to Mus rattus, and then to 
human beings. In this way are explained the outbreaks 
of plague in India, year after year since 1896, causing 
nearly a million deaths in 1904 among the natives, while 
the attendants and Europeans enjoy almost complete 
immunity, although both hospitals and camps abound 
with Pulex irritans. This is ascribed to the habits of this 
common flea of man, in that it rarely bites other creatures 
than man, and that in man with plague the blood is not 
so alive with bacilli as in the rat. The chances of infec- 
tion by Pulex irritans are from these causes enormously 
reduced. 

2. By inhalation of the virus, causing the pneumonic 
form of the plague, which is very rapid and fatal. It is 
not understood what factors determine the appearance of 
the disease in this form, but once started it is extremely 
infectious. The symptoms are very similar to those of 
acute lobar pneumonia (although the pneumonia is mainly 
lobular in its distribution), with high fever, rapid respiration, 
and haemorrhagic sputa. The sputum contains the bacilli 
in enormous numbers, and almost in pure culture. In 
Egypt, the summer type is bubonic, and the winter type 
pneumonic. 



260 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Cimex lectularius, or the common bed-bug, has lately 
been investigated as a carrier of plague bacilli. Enormous 
numbers can be found in the stomach of the bug after 
infection, and for four to five days. Two bugs were still 
alive eighty-three days after the feeding, and broth and 
agar cultures were obtained from their bodies. Inoculation 
of mice produced typical results, and the B. pestis was 
recovered. 

Other types of plague are described, which do not come 
under the above headings. These are : the ambulant form, 
in which the patient has a few days of fever, with swelling 
of the glands of the groin, and possibly suppuration. 
These cases are often found at the beginning of an epidemic, 
and are a source of great danger to the community, as the 
urine and faeces contain bacilli ; and the septic&mic type, in 
which the patient succumbs to a virulent infection before 
the buboes appear. There are also cutaneous and intestinal 
types, the former showing petechise and subcutaneous 
haemorrhages ; the latter, diarrhoea and haemorrhages from 
the mucous membranes, and sometimes the features of 
enteric. 

In India, an analysis of 11,600 cases gave 77-65 per cent 
of bubonic type, 14-25 per cent of the septicaemic type, 
and 4-4 per cent of the pneumonic type. The mortality 
was highest in the pneumonic type (96-69 per cent), and 
almost as high in the septicaemic. In the bubonic form, 
out of 9,500 cases, 5,130 (54 per cent) showed the glands 
of the groin first affected, and usually on the third to 
the fifth day.* Resolution may occur, or suppuration, 
or in rare cases, gangrene. Suppuration is noted as a 
favourable feature. 

The appearance of petechiae, or " plague spots," or 
" tokens of the disease," gave to it in the middle ages the 
name of the " black death." 

Toxins. The filtrate of a plague culture has a very 
slight toxic effect, but not capable of inducing immuniza- 
tion. Hence it is believed that little or no soluble toxin 
exists. Injection of dead bacilli produces distinctly toxic 

* The areas of skin surface which drain respectively into the glands of the groin, 
axilla, and neck, are as 5:1-8: i, and the number of primary buboes observed in 
hospital in these glands were as 5-8 : 1-3 : i respectively. 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 261 

effects. These endotoxins are comparatively resistant to 
heat', being unaffected by exposure to 65 C. for one hour. 
By the injection of these endotoxins in suitable doses, a 
degree of immunity against living virulent bacilli is 
obtained. The serum of such immunized animals is found 
to confer a degree of protection on small animals. 
Immunization. 

1. Preventive inoculation. Haffkine's method. Cultures 
are made in flasks, with oil drops on the surface. Stalactite 
growths form, and the flasks are shaken every few days 
to break those formed, and so induce fresh crops. The 
incubation temperature is 25 C., and six weeks' growth 
is allowed. Thereafter the culture is sterilized by heating 
for one hour at 65 C., and carbolic acid is added to make 
the bulk contain 0-5 per cent. The contents are well 
shaken to distribute the sediment, and then bottled for 
use, the fluid thus containing the dead bodies of bacilli as 
well as any toxins that may be in solution. It is 
administered subcutaneously, and usually in one dose of 
5 c.c. The susceptibility is said to be reduced to one- 
fourth, and the mortality among those inoculated who 
take the disease is about one-half of that among the 
non-inoculated. Protection begins a few days after inocu- 
lation and lasts for several months. 

2. Anti-plague Serum. Yersin has prepared a serum 
from horses, by injecting dead bacilli into the sub- 
cutaneous tissues, then into the veins, and finally, living 
bacilli intravenously. After a time, blood is drawn off, and 
the serum preserved in the usual way ; 10 to 20 c.c. are 
injected daily. Some curative power has been observed. 

Serum Diagnosis. Specific agglutinins appear in the 
blood of some patients, but the potency of the serum is 
not strong, and the test is not easily carried out, owing to 
the tendency of the bacilli to adhere in clumps preventing 
a satisfactory emulsion being got. Hence the macroscopic 
or sedimentation method is preferable. Cairns, in the 
Glasgow cases, found that the reaction appeared about a 
week after onset of the illness, increased until the sixth 
week, and then faded away ; being most marked in severe 
cases taking an early and favourable crisis, less in severe 
cases tending to a fatal issue, and feeble or absent in the 
mild cases. The best dilutions were i-io to 1-50. 



262 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Methods of Diagnosis. 

Bubonic. (i) Prepare the skin over a bubo, and remove 
some juice by aspiration with a sterile hypodermic syringe, 
the needle of which is plunged into the bubo ; (2) Make 
smears, and cultures on agar and salt agar ; (3) Inoculate 
a guinea-pig with some of the material, by rubbing it in on 
the shaven skin with a glass spatula, or by subcutaneous 
injection. 

In bubonic plague, a diagnosis in many cases can be 
made by microscopic examination alone, as in no known 
condition other than plague do bacilli with the same 
morphological characters occur in such numbers in the 
lymphatic glands. 

Pneumonic. (i) Microscopic examination of the 
sputum ; (2) Make cultures, inoculate a guinea-pig ; also 
a rat by smearing the sputum on its nasal mucous- 
membrane. 

In pneumonic plague, a positive diagnosis should not be 
given from microscopic examination alone, especially in 
a plague-free district, as bacilli morphologically resembling 
the plague organism may occur in the sputum in con- 
ditions other than plague. 

Post Mortem of Rat Dead of Plague. Subcutaneous 
injection of the flaps of the abdominal wall is noted. Fluid 
in the pleural cavities, haemorrhagic oedema of the neck 
glands, a creamy mottled appearance of the liver, and a 
somewhat similar appearance of the spleen. The Indian 
investigators laid stress on an abundant, clear, pleural 
effusion. The neck glands are chiefly involved in the 
rat because the flea prefers the skin of the neck ; in 
California and Glasgow, however, the cervical bubo was 
not so commonly found as in India. 

In chronic rat plague, enlargement of the spleen, with 
the formation of nodules in it containing plague bacilli, 
was the usual finding. 

Prophylaxis. 

Destruction of rats, by poisoning, trapping, ferreting, 

and virus. 
Separation of rats from mankind by better drainage, 

paving of yards, concrete floors, and general 

repairs. 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 263 

Removal of rat food, by frequent scavenging and 

attention to the feeding of fowls, pigs, etc. 
Slaughter-houses require special attention. 
General campaign of cleanliness, avoidance of 

fatigue of body or mind, and temperance in all 

things. 
Haffkine's prophylactic inoculation, at least to all 

those on the staff or otherwise specially exposed 

to infection. 

Nursing. Bubonic plague requires no special pre- 
cautions, as it is not infectious. The liberal use of iodoform 
as a dusting powder, on the person and clothing, is strongly 
recommended to prevent the attacks of fleas. 

Pneumonic plague is acutely infectious, hence both 
doctor and nurse should wear a cotton-wool respirator, 
as should also the attendants. 

SUMMARY. Plague is a rat disease. It is conveyed 
from rat to rat, and from rat' to. man, by the rat flea. The 
human flea is not involved to any extent in the matter. 
Bubonic plague is not an infectious disease, as this phrase 
is commonly understood. Pneumonic plague is most 
infectious, apart altogether from the question of fleas. 
Plague pneumonias breed true, i.e., give rise to other 
cases of pneumonic plague. The B. pestis blood-count 
is low in man, high in the rat. This affords an explana- 
tion of the high degree of infectivity of the rat flea 
as compared with the human flea. Insanitary conditions 
apart from the presence of rats play a secondary part. 
In Suffolk, Mus rattus is rare, Mus decumanus is common ; 
therefore close contact with plague-stricken rats is unlikely, 
and hence the small epidemic. (Pringle, " The Outbreak 
of Rat Plague in Suffolk," Public Health, January, 1911.)

C. J. Martin, and the subsequent discussion, see Brit. Med.

SUMMARY OF THE " LANCET " REPORTS ON THE PLAGUE IN 
CHINA, 1910-1911. 

The outbreak of plague in China, beginning in Manchuria 
on October i2th, 1910, and extending rapidly until it had 



264 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

invaded widely separated districts, was notable in several 
important particulars. The epidemic was almost without 
exception one of primary pneumonic plague. The fatality 
was extremely high, few cases of recovery having been 
reported. The infectious nature of the malady was very 
great, and the virus was apparently carried by the sputum. 
The origin of the plague was not ascribed to rats, but to 
marmots, a species of squirrel living in burrows. The 
question of infection by fleas is here of minor 'importance, 
once the epidemic is started. Its relation to the origin of 
the epidemic has not been worked out. Once begun, the 
propagation was apparently by direct inhalation of the 
virus. 

The Chinese Government invited the other Governments 
to send representatives to an International Plague 
Conference, which began its sittings at Mukden on April 
3rd, 1911. The following statements are taken from the 
reports of the proceedings published in the Lancet from 
April 29th, 1911, onwards, which include an exhaustive 
report by Dr. G. Douglas Gray, physician to H.B.M. 
Legation, Peking, the questions for discussion, and the 
Chairman's inaugural address. 

Origin. It had been known for many years that in 
Eastern Siberia and Mongolia the marmot, or tarabagan 
(Russian), or han ta (Chinese), a variety of the squirrel 
tribe, of the rodent genus, frequently suffers from a fatal 
disease which may be transmitted to man and produce 
symptoms indistinguishable from bubonic and pneumonic 
plague. This animal is hunted for its fur, which is used 
to imitate sable and other furs. One of its favourite 
haunts is a mountain range in the north-west of Man- 
churia, and here large numbers of Chinese are employed 
trapping it during the summer months. It was among 
these trappers that the present outbreak is held to have 
originated. The proof that the " tarabagan disease " in 
man, and plague, were one and the same disease, has 
not been given bacteriologically, and in 1905, 1906, and 
1907, Russian scientific expeditions were sent to investi- 
gate and report. Dr. M. T. Schreiber concluded that : 
(i) Epizootics (a term applied to those animal diseases 
which behave as epidemics do in the human species) 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 265 

undoubtedly do occur without human beings becoming 
infected ; (2) Field mice do not contract the disease from 
the tarabagan, though they have every chance of doing so, 
and are known to be susceptible to plague ; (3) Domestic 
animals also escape it, although dogs eat the flesh of the 
dead marmot. 

Dr. B. A. Barykin reported in 1909 the following facts : 
In 1906 the marmots around a settlement called Abogaitui 
showed a high mortality from spring to autumn, but the 
inhabitants were aware of the danger and avoided all 
contact with the sick animals, except a Cossack, who- 
was in indifferent health and had a craving for the 
flesh of a tarabagan. He got some, fell ill with the 
symptoms of plague, and died in four days. Others 
became ill, and in all eight died with symptoms of 
pneumonic plague. Post mortems were held in two cases, 
and bacilli indistinguishable from the plague bacilli were 
found in the organs ; and mice injected with the 
splenic juice died in twenty-six hours with the typical 
appearances. This was in September, 1906. In the 
autumn of 1907, marmots were caught or killed by the 
party and examined for the presence of disease. In one 
of these animals showing no external signs of being ill 
save some degree of malnutrition, the spleen was found 
to be swollen and congested, and contained large numbers- 
of bacilli identical in morphology and culture with the 
plague bacilli. A fortnight later, twelve miles from where 
this animal was discovered, the men of an isolated Cossack 
family, hunting the marmots around them, killed one 
showing clear signs of illness. In spite of the counsel of 
the elder men the animal was skinned and the body was 
given to a girl of thirteen years to take to the .fields. She 
dragged its body (said to be 15 Ib. weight) after her 
through the grass, and returned barefoot over the same 
path. On the next day she fell ill, a bubo appeared in 
the left groin, and she died some days later with all the 
symptoms of plague. From the bubo, from a pustule on 
a finger, and from the spleen, bacilli indistinguishable from 
plague bacilli were isolated, and being injected into mice 
caused their death in eighteen hours, of septicaemia. 
Neither the body nor the skin of the animal was recovered. 



266 

The rest of the family escaped. The same autumn a railway 
guard who had caught marmots, and a woman who had 
skinned them, both died of a disease resembling bubonic 
plague. In the guard, typical bacilli were found. A 
history of ten outbreaks in nine years in the district around 
one railway station was elicited. Various other localized 
outbreaks were reported, all tending to show that plague 
was not new to the districts where Mongolia, Manchuria, 
and Siberia adjoin. 

Spread. Beginning then in the north-west borders of 
Manchuria among the marmot hunters, it was carried by 
these in travelling back to their homes, many of them 
having come from the Shantung province, south of Peking. 
In the third week of October, 1910, about 10,000 of these 
men had gathered in Manchourie and Khailar, stations on 
the Vladivostock railway, waiting to sell the skins they 
had gathered and to return to the south for the winter and 
the new year festival. Cases of illness occurred here, with 
symptoms of headache, fever, spitting of blood-coloured 
sputum, and followed by rapid death. Apparently in spite 
of the risks not many hunters die on the plains ; but 
when crowded into the poor hovels or inns of the market- 
towns, where, in small badly ventilated rooms, twenty to 
forty may be found living, sleeping, and eating beside piles 
of raw pelts the conditions for the encouragement of 
any epidemic disease are ideal. From these foci the 
infection spread by railway trains in which the hunters 
were carried to Harbin, then south to Chang-chun, thence 
to Mukden, on to Tientsin, and from there to their home 
villages in the Shantung province ; and also by foot 
travellers who struck across country through Kirin city 
(eighty miles from a railway) to Dalny, and thence by 
boat to Chefoo, a port in the Shantung province. All 
the way men were falling ill and dying, and the sick 
and dead were thus deposited at all the places passed 
en route. The infection reached Harbin on November 
yth, and in three months there were 5,000 deaths out 
of a population of 30,000. Two factors seem to have 
contributed largely to the virulence cf the epidemic in 
the Chinese city. First, the severe climatic conditions, the 
thermometer registering at times 30 C. ( 22 F., or 54 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 267 

degrees of frost), which prevented the people going out of 
doors. Secondly, the low, dark, dirty, and overcrowded 
houses which form the majority of the dwellings. Never- 
theless in Shuangcheng Fu, a finely planned city with wide 
streets, spacious compounds, and well-constructed houses, 
and with but little poverty, there were 1,500 deaths in 
seven weeks out of 60,000 inhabitants. 

Symptoms. The incubation period in the majority of 
cases was five days. There were no marked prodromal 
symptoms. Often a man had a normal pulse and 
temperature on one day and was dead the next. The 
invasion was without rigor, with feelings of illness, weak- 
ness, and giddiness. A sudden onset with headache, then 
bloated face and suffused conjunctive (septicaemic cyanosis)^ 
with temperature over 103 F., and fast fluttering pulse, 
was usual. The respirations averaged thirty-five per 
minute. Coarse crepitant rales were noted all over the 
chest, but little or no impairment of resonance. These 
rales are due to marked oedema of the lungs in the late 
stages of the disease. In the earlier stages rales are rarely 
present even in serious cases, and then they are usually 
fine. Blood-stained sputum is often the first sign of 
illness in pneumonic cases. The signs of cardiac involve- 
ment are always marked in advanced cases : very rapid 
feeble running pulse, agonizing dyspnoea, galloping rhythm 
of the heart sounds, and sudden heart failure. Death 
occurs from the intoxication, with paralysis of the heart. 
Death resulted in attempts to move patients and where 
the patients sat up in bed for a few minutes to take nourish- 
ment. Labial herpes was not observed in any of the 
patients seen in hospital, which is a point noted before 
and interesting in comparison with acute lobar pneumonia, 
in which it frequently occurs. In the septicaemic form 
there may be a flow of blood from the nose or mouth 
shortly before death. No glandular enlargements were 
noted except once at Harbin, where there was a sub- 
maxillary bubo followed by secondary plague pneumonia 
and death. The bacteriological diagnosis was the only 
certain one, as the symptoms were so variable. Many 
were able to walk about until within a few hours of death, 
and up to that time declaring that they were quite well. 



268 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Etiology and Pathology. Dr. R. P. Strong and Dr. Teague 
performed twenty-five post-mortem examinations, and 
came to the following conclusions : That epidemic plague 
pneumonia results from inhalation, the primary point of 
infection being the bronchi. Through the bronchi the 
bacilli reach the lung tissue, and rapidly multiplying there 
they produce pneumonic changes of the lobular type and 
later more general lobar involvement. The blood becomes 
quickly infected and a true bacteriaemia results in every 
case. Secondary pathological changes occur, especially in 
the spleen, bronchial glands, heart, blood-vessels, kidneys, 
and liver. The fact that the bronchial glands at the 
bifurcation of the trachea are always much more affected 
than any of the other lymphatics, argues against the theory 
that epidemic plague pneumonia is primarily a septicaemia 
with secondary involvement of the lungs. Moreover, in 
the earliest stages of the disease, the blood may be free of 
plague bacilli. The condition observed in the trachea and 
bronchi in epidemic plague pneumonia is pathognomic of 
this condition alone. The throat and larynx may show 
characteristic appearances at times. The tonsils may 
become secondarily infected like other lymph follicles, but 
the duration of the disease is too short to allow of this as a 
rule. Primary infection by tonsil can occur, with enlarge- 
ment of the glands of the neck early in the disease. The 
oesophagus was found normal in every case, which argues 
against primary intestinal plague infection, since plague 
bacilli must have been repeatedly swallowed in sputum 
and bronchial secretion in many of the cases. 

Dr. Koulecha, who had dissected twenty-eight plague 
corpses, read a communication in which he differed in 
toto from the above in regard to the mode of infection. 
From the necropsies and microscopical examination of the 
tissues he concludes that pneumonic plague is a septicasmic 
disease, in which an overflooding of the blood and the 
lymphatic system with bacilli could be observed. 
Infectious matter entered the mouth, affecting en route 
the tonsils, mucous membrane of the trachea, bronchi, 
and neighbouring lymphatic glands ; and from these the 
bacilli passed into the blood. The lungs were apparently 
affected secondarily from the blood, which he inferred from 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 269 

the great accumulation of the plague bacilli in the peri- 
vascular spaces. On this view, pneumonic plague is a 
lobar pleuro-pneumonia of haematogenous origin, and 
should be classed with croupous pneumonia. Dr. Fujinami 
confirmed these findings. Professor Zabolotny observed 
that it had not been sufficiently proved how many were of 
direct pulmonary origin and how many were of haemato- 
genous origin. 

Rats and Fleas. Professor Kitasato reported that of 
30,000 rats examined in South Manchuria, 6 per cent were 
Mus rattus, but none of the 30,000 showed plague infection. 
In North China, of 3,000 rats examined living by Dr 
Andrew, all were Mus decumanus ; he had never found 
Mus rattus. He had noted a seasonal flea prevalence, 
highest in September, October, and November. The only 
species noted was Pulex cheopis. Dr. Petrie found both 
Pulex cheopis and Ceratophyllus unisus among fleas 
examined at Mukden. Dr. Petrie also examined twelve 
tarabagans sent direct from Manchuria to Mukden. On 
these he found thirty-five fleas, twelve being on one 
alone. (Ticks were also observed on them.) The fleas 
found were unusually large, and on superficial examination 
appeared to belong to the genus Histricopsylla (eyeless, 
truncated head, comb on the inferior border of head, 
thorax, and part of abdomen, numerous long hairs over 
the body). 

In an epidemic of plague in Tongshan, in 1908, bubonic 
cases predominated at the first, but the proportion of 
septicaemic and pneumonic gradually increased. Of the 
rats examined, i per cent were found to be affected. 
Some rats which remained well for days without any sign 
of glandular enlargement during life, were found post 
mortem to have Bacillus pestis in the splenic blood, and 
were evidently immune to infection, at least for the time 
being. Rats trapped in the mines in the neighbourhood 
were found to be less readily infected experimentally 
than those found above ground. The death-rate in the 
Tongshan epidemic was 800 out of 1000 cases. 

Diagnosis. Sputum is scanty at first, and the bacilli 
are difficult to find in it. Later, it is almost a pure culture. 
Professor Zabolotny advised Gram's method for staining 



270 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

the sputum. He had often noted mixed infections, and a 
Gram-negative bi-polar-staining bacillus was seen at times, 
which was not the plague bacillus. It required further 
study. Involution forms bore no relation to virulence. 
Blood cultures could usually be got forty-eight hours 
before death. At least i c.c. of blood must be used for 
the test. In this way an earlier diagnosis could be made 
than by the sputum. In recovered bubonic cases, agglu- 
tination could be got in the second and third weeks with 
dilutions of 1-25 and 1-50. Agglutination and fixation 
of the complement experiments were of little value in 
pneumonic plague. Dr. Broquet advised the use of the 
following solution for the conservation of suspicious 
plague organs for future study or transmission to a 
laboratory at a distance : neutral glycerin, 20 c.c., 
calcium carbonate, 2 grm., distilled water, 80 c.c. Mix at 
30 C., and immerse tissues. 

Vaccination. Protective vaccination with attenuated 
plague bacilli was advocated by Dr. Strong. Professor 
Galeotti advised the vaccine of Lustig and Galeotti for 
these reasons : (i) The toxin (Galeotti holds that it is an 
endotoxin and non-soluble ; Zabolotny holds that it is a 
soluble toxin), and no other substance, is used ; (2) It can 
be dried and standardized ; (3) The plague nucleo-proteid 
can be stored in a sterile condition. The general experience 
was that no form of vaccination gave much protection 
against pneumonic plague. 

Serum Therapy. Dr. Martini advised passive immuniza- 
tion for all those exposed to infection, such as doctors and 
nurses, etc. Small doses were useless ; 100 c.c. at least 
must be used, and repeated soon. As regarded the present 
epidemic, he thought the protective value was small. 
Professor Zabolotny reported that he had used up to 
i litre of serum without success, only prolonging the illness. 
Dr. Paul Haffkine had seen protective effect after large 
doses, but this did not last more than five days. 

Quarantine. The use of railway cars for this purpose 
was a new feature. This gives a segregation camp divided 
into small units, each completely isolated from the other, 
easy of disinfection, easy to supervise and for the detection 
of onset of sickness. There were 3000 suspects thus 



NON-SPORIXG BACILLI 271 

isolated at Harbin, the railway cars being drawn into 
specially constructed sidings. 

Disposal of the Dead. With the ground frozen at 40 C., 
ordinary burial of such large numbers of bodies was not 
easy. In spite of Chinese traditions, the Government 
gave orders for the cremation of the bodies of those dead 
of plague. This was carried out thus at Harbin : A pit 
20 feet square by 10 feet deep was made by blasting with 
dynamite. When bodies were in coffins, these sufficed to 
aid the burning ; but if they were not, four pieces of 
round wood 4 inches in diameter by 2 feet long, were 
added per body. The pit held about 500 bodies, and 
into it kerossne was pumped from a fire-engine ; about 
10 gallons per 100 bodies. On being set alight the 
mass burned fiercely and rapidly, and little but ashes 
remained. 

End of Epidemic. The epidemic seemed to die out 
(April, 1911) when the temperature rose to - 20 C. 
( 4 F.). The total mortality was over 40,000. 

Summary of Conclusions. The disease spread by direct 
infection from man to man. Whatever may have been 
its primary origin, there is no evidence that a concurrent 
epizootic in rodents played any part in its wide dissemina- 
tion. From Russian sources reports of an epizootic 
disease among tarabagans have been received, and it is 
not unlikely that this is plague, but the bacteriological 
proof is not yet complete. The infection was introduced 
into towns and villages by persons actually suffering from, 
or by those in the incubation stage of, the disease. There 
has been no positive epidemiological evidence to show 
that the disease has been spread by clothing, merchandise, 
or other inanimate objects. So far as can be ascertained 
the only infective agent in the epidemic has been the 
sputum of the plague patient. In the majority of the 
cases the disease has been contracted by the inhalation 
of plague bacilli in droplets of sputum, causing infection 
of the lower portion of the trachea and of the bronchi. 
In infection by inhalation the risk to the person exposed 
bears a direct relation to his proximity to the patient 
and to the duration of the exposure. In view of this, 
masks and goggles should be worn by all who come in 



272 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

contact with cases of the disease or suspected cases. The 
best form of mask is a three-tailed gauze bandage with 
a pad of cotton-wool. It should be destroyed or dis- 
infected after each exposure to infection. The epidemic 
was, almost without exception, one of primary pneumonic 
plague, with an incubation period of from two to five days. 
An increased temperature and pulse-rate are usually the 
earliest signs observable, but a diagnosis cannot be made 
until the organisms are recognized in the characteristic 
blood-stained sputum. 

An accurate diagnosis can only be made by a bacterio- 
logical examination of the sputum to exclude pneumonic 
infection due to other micro-organisms. Since the evidence 
points to the conclusion that in the epidemic all the cases 
became septicaemic, an examination of the blood micro- 
scopically or culturally may be a valuable aid in diagnosis. 
The physical signs of lung involvement are too indefinite 
and appear too late in the course of the disease to be of 
diagnostic value, and even in cases in which the condition 
of the patient is grave they may be very slight. 

The fatality has been extremely high, scarcely any 
recovering. The general experience has been that no 
method of treatment has been of avail in saving life, but 
that the serum treatment seems in a few instances to have 
prolonged it. The decline of the epidemic has not been 
due to any loss of virulence of the bacillus, but probably 
to the preventive measures which were enforced either in 
accordance with scientific methods or by the efforts of 
the people to protect themselves. 

The statistics of prophylactic inoculation collected 
during the past epidemic do not allow of any definite 
conclusion being formed about their value in plague 
pneumonia ; but in bubonic plague it was argued that 
some degree of protection is conferred by the use of 
vaccines. Further experiments in animals are recom- 
mended, in reference to securing immunity against 
pneumonic plague infection. (Lancet, 1911, vol. i, 
pp. 1614-16.) 



XON-SPORING BACILLI 273 



THE TUBERCLE BACILLUS. 

This bacillus is the cause of tuberculosis, an infective 
disease, characterized by lesions which are nodular bodies 
called " tubercles," or by diffuse infiltrations of tuberculous 
tissue, which may undergo caseation and finally ulcerate, 
or may become sclerosed, and in some cases calcified. 
The infectious nature of tuberculous material was for long 
suspected, was proved by Villemin in 1865, and by Armanni 
and Cohnheim and Salomonsen from 1870 to 1880, 
Baumgarten first described the bacillus in sections, but 
Koch first established its causal nature on a solid basis 
by : (i) Demonstrating the presence of the tubercle 
bacillus in a great variety of tissues and organs ; (2) Pre- 
paring pure cultures of the organism from these ; 
(3) Producing the disease by the inoculation of the bacillus 
derived from pure culture ; and (4) Recovering the same 
organism from the diseased parts of inoculated animals. 
These four articles are known as Koch's postulates, and 
all of them have to be satisfied before an organism 
can be absolutely proved as the cause of a specific 
disease. At present, for quite a number of bacteria, 
some of these postulates have yet to be fulfilled as 
regards mankind. 

Description. Bacillus tuberculosis is a slender rod, often 
slightly curved, measuring 2-5 to 3-5 micra long by 0-3 
micron in width. They are of uniform thickness, or may 
show slight swelling at the ends or even in their length. 
They may lie singly in the tissues or sputum, but often in 
small heaps or masses. In cultures, a remarkable fila- 
mentous growth has been repeatedly observed. In the 
sputum, long branching hypha-like filaments, sometimes 
with swollen ends, have been found. These are looked 
upon by some bacteriologists as involution forms, but many 
regard them as evidence of the relationship of the tubercle 
bacillus to the hyphomycetes. A capsular or enveloping 
substance is produced by the bacillus, more by the human 
form than by the bovine, and more the longer the growth 
on blood serum. When stained, the bacillus often appears 
beaded, the unstained spaces being regarded as vacuoles 
by some and as spores by others. Inasmuch as the bacilli 

18 



274 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

showing these have no increased resistance against heat 
and disinfectants, the spore interpretation is probably 
incorrect. The beads or highly stained portions have 
likewise been called spores, but the whole matter is at 
present unsettled. 

The tubercle bacillus stains imperfectly or not at all 
with ordinary watery aniline dyes, and only after long 
exposure or heating, or more quickly if a mordant is used. 
Once stained, the bacilli retain the dye tenaciously, in 
spite of treatment with alcohol or strong acids, and for the 
latter reason they are spoken of as " acid-fast " bacilli (acid- 
proof would be a better term). This feature seems to be 
due to the presence of fatty substances in the cell, and 
has furnished the basis for differential staining methods. 
The fatty substances are really wax-like in nature, and are 
soluble in alcohol + ether. 

B. tuberculosis is non-motile, non-flagellar, non-sporing, 
does not grow on gelatin, and is Gram-positive. Recently 
varieties have been described which are not acid-fast, but 
are stained by Gram's method prolonged, and these forms 
are stated to be present in old tuberculous lesions, where 
the ordinary form is not found and yet the material is 
virulent. These are, (i) A fine bacillary form, often 
showing granules, and (2) Free granules. Much also 
found that when acid-fast forms were added to milk 
(sterilized) and incubated, the acid-fast forms disappeared, 
and yet when the milk was injected into an animal, tuber- 
culosis was produced and in the lesions acid-fast bacilli 
were demonstrable. If these statements are conclusively 
proved, they are of the first importance. 

Chemical Analysis of Tubercle Bacilli. Water 85-9 per 
cent, solids 14-1 per cent. The ash shows 55 per cent of 
P 2 O 5 , 12-6 per cent of CaO, 11-5 per cent of Mg, 13-6 per 
cent of Na 2 O, 6-3 per cent of K 2 O. 

Cultures. The bacillus is not easily cultivated ; growth 
fails, or is slow or scanty ; fails on agar and gelatin entirely, 
but on glycerin agar (3 to 6 per cent) and in glycerin broth 
(6 per cent) growth takes place in ten to fifteen days, 
becoming visible first as dry white spots, the extension 
and fusion of which form a dull, whitish, wrinkled pellicle 
or layer. These media are suitable for subcultures ; for 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 275 

growth direct from the tissues, blood serum and Dorset's 
egg media are commonly used. 

On blood serum, at 37-5 C., growth appears in ten to 
fourteen days as minute spots, rather irregular, raised 
above the surface, and comparable to small dry scales. 
The culture is got by inoculating with a sterile platinum 
loop from foci in a tuberculous gland ; or by planting an 
actual piece of tissue on to the surface of the serum ; or 
by inoculating with tubercle bacilli, derived by the 
anti-formin method (see later) from sputum or digested 
tissue. 

On Dorset's egg media, vigorous growth takes place 
ressmbling that on blood serum. To make the medium : 
take the whole contents of four eggs, beat well, add 25 c.c. 
of water, and mix thoroughly ; filter through muslin to 
remove air bells ; fill into tubes, and heat these in 
sloped position for four hours at 70 C. They are 
now ready ; but before inoculation, two drops of steri- 
lized water are placed on the surface of the medium. 
When inoculating, the material is well rubbed over the 
surface, the plug is replaced, and is sealed over with a 
few drops of paraffin, and the tube incubated in the 
sloped position. 

On glycerin potato, growth takes place, and on other 
purely vegetable media. 

Optimum Conditions. B. tuberculosis is markedly aerobic. 
It grows at human blood-heat, 37 to 38 C. The usual 
range is 28 to 42 C. but it can be acclimatized to grow 
at 22 to 23 C. In fluid media it is killed in fifteen to twenty 
minutes at 60 C., in five minutes at 80 C., and in one to 
two minutes at 90 C. It can resist dry heat at 100 C. for 
one hour. Simple drying is not efficient, as still virulent 
forms have been found in dried tuberculous sputum after 
two months. Similarly, putrefaction of sputa or tissue does 
not destroy the bacilli readily, for they have been found 
alive under such conditions after three weeks. Gastric 
juice failed to kill them in six hours, and several three- 
hour spells of freezing at 3 C. had little effect. Direct 
sunlight rapidly kills them ; 5 per cent carbolic kills them 
in a few minutes, but if, as in sputum, they are protected 
by mucus, complete disinfection takes five to six hours. 



276 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Perchloride of mercury is not very efficient, from the 
albuminate formed. The comparatively high powers of 
resistance (for an organism not admitted to have spores) 
are attributed to the protective qualities of the waxy cell 
membrane. The conclusion then is, that moist heat at 
100 C. will kill the bacilli in fluids and tissues, provided 
time is given for penetration of bulky materials. In 
Germany, tuberculous ox flesh is thus sterilized (four hours 
boiling) and then allowed to be sold. 

Pathogenicity. For man is great : 10 per cent of all the 
deaths in Great Britain and in the United States of America 
are due to tuberculosis of one kind or another. This of 
course represents only a portion of the incidence of tuber- 
culosis, as many people are attacked and succeed in throw- 
ing off the infection. In fact it may be said that the fatal 
attack of tuberculosis is in many cases only the last of a 
long series of attacks more or less successfully repulsed. 
The commonest type in man is phthisis pulmonalis, then 
affections of lymphatic glands, bones and joints, and serous 
membranes. 

In America, 22 per cent of the deaths among the North 
American Indians, and 16 per cent among the negroes, 
are due to tuberculosis. 

For animals, the pathogenicity varies, but most are 
vulnerable. The question is at present clouded by the 
statement that various types of tubercle bacilli exist, 
such as the human type, the bovine type, and the avian 
type, and that these types vary in their power over the 
different animal species. 

Ignoring for the moment the different types, tuberculosis 
is mostly found in cattle and pigs. Dogs and cats 
occasionally suffer, and monkeys and apes (immune when 
in the wild state) are very subject to it and mostly die of 
it in captivity. Horses are rarely attacked, and sheep 
are practically immune. Of ah 1 the home cattle slaughtered 
in the Glasgow market in 1910 (67,849), 12-98 per cent 
showed lesions of tuberculosis, and of 39,724 swine, 6'I2 
per cent ; while out of 307,784 sheep not one showed 
tuberculous lesions. The rate among cattle is excessive 
from the large proportion of milch cows included, some 
of which are imported into the city and are kept in byres 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 277 

until sent to be slaughtered. Apart from that, however, 
the figures suggest the influence of open-air life in 
lowering the susceptibility of the sheep and the chances 
of infection. 

B. tuberculosis of the human type is pathogenic for 
guinea-pigs, less so for rabbits, and still less so for 
dogs. 

B. tuberculosis of the bovine type is very pathogenic for 
guinea-pigs, killing them more quickly and producing 
more extensive lesions than the human type ; while 
intravenous injection in rabbits causes an acute tuber- 
culosis with death in from two to five weeks ; the 
human type causing a mild, slow disease, usually lasting 
for six months, and at times failing to kill the rabbit. 
This is the readiest method of distinguishing these 
two types. 

The human type is found in the majority of human 
infections (46 out of 60 investigated), never in bovine 
tuberculosis. 

The bovine type is found always in bovine tuberculosis, 
and in a considerable number of cases of human tuber- 
culosis (14 out of 60 = 23 per cent), and in all the latter 
but one, the lesions were of the cervical lymphatic glands, 
or were lesions of primary abdominal tuberculosis, that 
is, were lesions which might fairly be attributed to feeding 
or alimentation. Moreover they were mostly in children, 
so that the deduction is made that bovine tuberculosis is 
transmissible to man, the milk of tuberculous cows being 
the usual vehicle. 

Bovine tubercle bacilli, in cultures, are shorter, thicker, 
and more regular in size than the human type, and their 
growth on the various media is scantier. They are more 
pathogenic to cattle and swine, and less so to man, which 
may explain the chronicity of abdominal and cervical 
glandular tuberculosis. 

A recent research by Park and Krumwiede confirms the 
results of previous investigations. They state that com- 
parative luxuriance or sparseness of growth is in most 
cases absolutelv to be relied on for differentiation.

The bacillus of avian tuberculosis shows a more 
luxuriant and moister growth than the human type, and 
grows at 43-5 C., is very pathogenic to rabbits, scarcely 
pathogenic to guinea-pigs, and not at all to dogs, even 
intravenously, whereas the human type produces an 
acute infection. Morphologically it is almost identical 
with the human type, and stains similarly. It is found 
in lesions in fowls and pigeons and some other bird 
species. Fowls fed on human tubercle bacilli are not 
found to become tuberculous. The identity of the two 
types is said to be established by the experiments of 
Nocard, who rendered mammalian tubercle bacilli 
pathogenic for fowls by keeping them in the peritoneal 
cavities of hens in collodion sacs for six months. Con- 
versely, prolonged cultivation and passage of the avian 
type through the mammalian body are said to cause them 
to approach closely to the mammalian type. 

The bacillus of a tubercle - like disease in a carp has 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 279 

been called the bacillus of fish tuberculosis. It grows 
luxuriantly at room temperature (20 C.), and does not grow 
at 37 C., its range being 15 to 30 C. It is non-pathogenic 
for mammals, but kills frogs in a month. It shows some 
degree of acid-fastness. 

Portals of Entry. Inheritance, ingestion, inhalation, 
and inoculation. Cobbett recently traverses the theories 
of Behring, Calmette, and Guerin, that the portal of entry 
of the tubercle bacilli, even in the pulmonary form, is via 
the alimentary tract and thence via the lymphatics to the 
lungs. He concludes that the intestine is not a common 
port of entry for the tubercle bacilli which cause phthisis. 
(Cobbett, " Portals of Entry of the Tubercle Bacillus," 
Jour, of Path, and Bad., vol. xiv., No. 4, 1910, p. 563). 
Leonard Findlay reaches the same conclusion from 
experiments on the production of pulmonary anthracosis 
in rabbits and guinea-pigs (Findlay, " The Origin of Pul- 
monary Anthracosis, an Experimental Study." Zeitschrift 
fiir Kinderheilkunde, 1911, vol. ii., part 2 (June), p. 293. 
B.M.J., 1911, vol. ii., p. 1278.) Feeding experiments 
undertaken for the Royal Commission on Tuberculosis 
gave results more in consonance with Calmette' s theories 
(see resume on page 297 ; details in Appendix to Final 
Report, vol. i., pp. 48 and 52). 

Toxins. The tubercle bacillus secretes no soluble toxin 
or only in very small amount. The chief toxic principles 
are endotoxins or bacterial proteins. Dead bacilli will, if 
inoculated in sufficient numbers, produce tubercle-like 
nodules, in which giant cells and occasionally caseation are 
present. These results are obtained with intravenous and 
intraperitoneal injections, whereas subcutaneous injection 
produces a sterile abscess (cold abscess). 

The hope of producing an active immunity led Koch to 
employ various means to extract from dead and living 
bacilli the complex bodies bound in them. 

1. Original Tuberculin, T.A. (Koch 1890-91). Tubercle 
bacilli are grown in 5 per cent glycerin broth for six 
to eight weeks. The entire culture is then heated on 
the water-bath at 80 C. until reduced to one-tenth of 
its original bulk. It is then filtered through sterile filter- 
paper or through porcelain filters. The filtrate is a thick, 



280 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

brown, syrupy liquid, containing the products of growth 
in the culture medium and a 50 per cent extract of the 
bodies of the bacilli by glycerin ; all in so far as these are 
indestructible by heat. Stored in a cool dark place it 
keeps indefinitely, the glycerin acting as a preservative. 
The dose of this preparation used in cattle is 0-25 c.c., but 
the stock is usually diluted with 0-5 per cent carbolic water 
four times, making the dose 2 c.c. Such a dose in a 
healthy man causes in three to four hours malaise, tendency 
to cough, laboured breathing, and moderate pyrexia, all 
passing off in twenty-four hours. In a man suffering 
from tuberculosis, such a dose would give rise to such an 
excessive reaction as probably to cause death. Even 
o-oi c.c. causes all the above symptoms in an aggravated 
degree, together with marked inflammatory reaction 
around any tuberculous focus, resulting in necrosis but 
not killing the bacilli. This is now known as the " tuber- 
culin reaction," and is much used in veterinary practice. 
It is also used in clinical work for help in diagnosis of obscure 
affections suspected to be tuberculous. 

i. Subcutaneously : Use diluted tuberculin, i-iooo, so 
that i c.c. = i mgr. of tuberculin. Koch in 1890 used 
I mgr., but now most clinicians begin with o-i mgr. or 
0-2 mgr. If no reaction occurs, after three to four days 
give i mgr. If again no reaction follows, wait three to 
four days and try 5 mgr., and finally, if still negative, 
10 mgr., but no more. If still no reaction, the person may 
be considered tubercle-free. Take temperature regularly 
before and after test. 

ii. Cutaneous test (von Pirquet, 1907). For this test 
von Pirquet first suggested a 25 per cent solution of " old 
tuberculin," but the latter is now used undiluted. The 
patient's skin on the flexor surface of the forearm is 
sterilized. Two separate drops of the tuberculin are placed 
on the skin, 2 to 4 in. apart. With a small metal bore 
the skin is scarified at a point midway between the two 
drops, and then that is covered by the drops. Within 
twenty-four to forty-eight hours in tuberculous patients 
redness round the points, a papule over the scarified surface, 
and minute vesicles all appear. The control area shows 
a slight traumatic redness which soon passes off. In a 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 281 

negative result all three areas show this slight reaction. 
Intermediate reactions, in all degrees, are observed. 
70 per cent of adults give a positive result, probably from 
healed tuberculosis. 

iii. Inunction of lanolin, containing 50 per cent of 
tuberculin (Moro's test). 

iv. Ophthalmo-tuberculin reaction (1907, Wolff-Eisner ; 
Calmette). For this test, " old tuberculin " is treated 
with 95 per cent alcohol, and the precipitate dissolved in 
water, and re-precipitated and dissolved several times, 
being finally made up to a I per cent watery solution. One 
drop of this is instilled into the conjunctival sac and 
allowed to spread all over it. A sharp congestion of both 
the ocular and palpebral conjunctivas results in six to ten 
hours in the case of a positive reaction, and passes off in 
twenty-four to thirty-six hours. In children, half the 
dose is used and the acme is reached sooner. In several 
cases the results of this test have been disastrous, the 
excessive reaction leading to destruction of tissue and 
blindness in the eye used for the test. 

2. New Tuberculin (Koch, 1897) Was introduced to pro- 
duce anti-bacterial immunity. It was prepared thus : baciUi 
from young virulent cultures were ground in an agate mill, 
washed with distilled water, and centrifugalized. The 
clear fluid was decanted and called tuberculin-O. The 
deposit was dried, ground, and treated as before ; and 
this was repeated several times until all the residue went 
into emulsion ; the resulting fluids mixed together are 
tuberculin-R. Tuberculin-O gives no precipitate with 
glycerin added to make a 50 per cent solution. Tuber- 
culin-R does precipitate in 50 per cent glycerin. Tuber- 
culin-O gives a reaction on injection more readily than 
tuberculin-R. 

3. Bacillary Emulsion (Koch, 1901). This is a I per 
cent emulsion of pulverized bacilli in distilled water, 
allowed to sediment for several days, and then the super- 
natant liquid is mixed with an equal bulk of glycerin, 
making the whole 50 per cent, i c.c. = 5 mgr. solids. 
It resembles a mixture of tuberculin-O and tuberculin-R. 

4. Bouillon F litre (Denys, 1905). A culture of tubercle 
bacilh in 5 per cent glycerin broth, filtered through 



282 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Chamberland filters and not heated, but 0-25 per cent 
phenol added to preserve. Corresponds to " old 
tuberculin," unconcentrated and unheated, and therefore 
supposed by Denys to contain important soluble but 
thermolabile substances. 

Therapeutic uses of the Tuberculins. (So-called 
Vaccine Therapy.) For these purposes, tuberculin-R and 
bacillary emulsion are mostly used in doses beginning at 
o-ooi mgr. ( T7 jV7j)> and gradually increased so long as the 
dose causes no greater disturbance of temperature than 
0-5 F. In Wright's method of treatment the initial dose 
is usually T ^^ mgr., and is rarely increased beyond y^Vir 
mgr. The dose is administered after determination 
of the opsonic index of the patient, and subsequent doses 
are only administered during the positive phase of the 
reaction to the previous dose. To determine this, 
repeated observations of the opsonic index have to be 
made. As a result of experience gained by a large number 
of observations, some authorities advise the use of smaller 
doses, g^iy^ mgr. every ten days, gradually increased to 
4T nnr mgr. in six months' time, without opsonic index 
estimation, but simply watching the clinical symptoms. 

In the serum of patients so treated there is evidence of 
the formation of bodies antagonistic to tuberculin, of the 
nature of immune-bodies, precipitins, and opsonins. 

Antituberculous Sera. Maragliano's Serum. Made 
by him by immunizing dogs, asses, and horses, by injecting 
a mixture of the nitrate of an unheated broth culture 
(i part) and an aqueous bacillary extract at 100 C. (3 
parts). The animal is bled after four to six months. 
Of the serum, 2 c.c. are injected subcutaneously every two 
days. Improvement has been noted in non-febrile cases. 
The serum is capable of protecting an otherwise healthy 
animal against a fatal dose of tuberculin. 

Marmorek's Serum. Marmorek believes the tubercle 
bacillus does not produce in ordinary media the same 
toxins that it does in the body, where it has to resist the 
antagonism of the body cells. To combat this he first 
grows the bacilli on a leucotoxic serum (produced by 
inoculating calves with guinea-pig leucocytes), and then 
on a medium containing liver extract, the liver being 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 283 

regarded as the most antituberculous tissue in the body. 
He thereafter uses these bacilli (which he states yield no 
tuberculin) to immunize animals, and for the serum 
produced he claims high curative powers. 

Tuberculin Tests applied to Cattle. In cattle, 
tuberculosis may be present without any very apparent 
symptoms until an advanced stage is reached. Routine 
examination of herds by the tuberculin test has therefore 
become one of the necessary measures in public sanitation, 
in order that the milk of tuberculous cows may be excluded 
from consumption, and that such cows may be eliminated 
from herds (Bang's System). Mohler states that an 
accurate diagnosis is established in 97 per cent of the cases. 
Stall the animal and take the temperature in the rectum 
every two hours from 6 a.m. until midnight. Make the 
injection then (subcutaneously) . Begin to take the tem- 
perature at 6 a.m. and continue as on the preceding day. 
The dose is usually 0-25 c.c. of old tuberculin. A positive 
reaction consists in febrile and constitutional signs, with 
marked congestion around any focus of tuberculosis. The 
febrile reaction begins six to ten hours after injection, 
reaches its height in nine to fifteen hours, and declines 
to normal in eighteen to twenty-six hours. A rise of 
2 F. or more above the maximum of the previous day 
should be regarded as a positive reaction. In a doubtful 
case, repeat in four to six weeks. (Normal rectal tempera- 
ture, 100 to 102 F. ; normal pulse, 45 to 55 beats per 
minute. 

Methods of Detection. i. Microscopic. In sputum : 
select a yellowish piece, make a film, and stain by acid-fast 
method. If not found, make solution of sputum by 
gradual addition of NaOH solution, boiling the while ; 
then sediment or centrifuge. Or mix in 5 per cent carbolic 
or 2 per cent lysol, and stand ; gradual solution, and 
tubercle bacilli precipitated. Or add antiformin (or a 
mixture of equal parts of solutions of NaCIO and NaOH, 
each 7-5 per cent) ; dissolves in a few minutes. If a 20 
per cent dilution of antiformin is used, the tubercle bacilli 
are not damaged, and all the other bacteria are killed. 
Centrifuge or sediment ; wash twice with normal salt 
solution, and sediment can then be used to make culture, 



284 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

or inoculate guinea-pig. In urine : sediment or centri- 
fuge, make films, and examine. To avoid smegma bacilli, 
take specimen after cleansing meatus, or by catheter, 
and in staining decolorize with absolute alcohol after 
the acid (see pp. 163 and 285. In pus, faeces, and tissues : 
dissolve in antiformin as above, and examine deposit. In 
milk : centrifuge, take sediment and fat, and mix, make 
films, fix, remove fat with ether (not absolutely necessary), 
stain, and examine. Also inject o-i c.c., i c.c. and 3 c.c. of 
mixed sediment and fat into three guinea-pigs respectively ; 
kill in three weeks and examine peritoneum, post-sternal 
glands, pancreas, spleen, and liver. 

2. Inoculation. Select a guinea-pig and inject, sub- 
cutaneously or intraperitoneally, the fluid to be tested, or 
the washed sediment from an antiformin solution of tissues, 
fasces, or sputum. The animal usually dies in six weeks, 
if tubercle bacilli are in the injected substance, with local 
and glandular changes, the spleen showing numerous 
tuberculous nodules and being swollen as a whole. 

3. Cultivation Is made from the inoculated animal, or 
from antiformin solution sediments, or from sputum 
treated with 2 per cent ericolin. 

4. T liber culin Reactions. 

OTHER ACID-FAST BACILLI. 

Besides the bacilli of human, bovine, avian, and fish 
tuberculosis, there are other bacteria which are acid- 
fast, as already enumerated on page 163. Such are : 
Moeller's Timothy - grass bacillus I (from infusions of 
Timothy grass), Moeller's Timothy-grass bacillus II (from 
the dust of a hay-loft), butter bacilli (isolated from butter 
by Petri, Rabinowitch, Korn, Tobler, Coggi, and others), 
mistbacillus (from dung by Moeller). All these are mor- 
phologically very similar to the tubercle bacilli, are ex- 
tremely acid-fast, and produce lesions in guinea-pigs on 
injection, which closely resemble tubercles. They are, 
however, easily distinguished by their rapid growth on 
ordinary media, colonies being visible in twenty-four hours 
a t 37 C. (in the case of the tubercle bacillus, the earliest 
is eight days), and by their growth in most instances at 



XON-SPORIXG BACILLI 285 

room temperature. The cultures themselves are, however, 
similar to those of tubercle bacilli, and of one another. 

Johne's Bacillus is the bacillus of " chronic bovine 
pseudo-tuberculous enteritis," a disease characterized by 
corrugated thickenings of the mucous membrane of the 
small intestine (especially), the bacilli occurring in large 
numbers in the lesions and in scrapings from the surface. 
The bacilli are like the tubercle bacilli, but slightly shorter ; 
they are equally acid-fast. They have not yet been 
cultivated on artificial media. 

Bacillus Smegmatis (the smegma bacillus) occurs in 
large numbers in the preputial secretions of the male, the 
external genitals of the female, and within the folds of the 
thighs and buttocks. The bacilli are usually found in 
clumps on the mucous membrane, and occasionally in the 
superficial layers of the epithelium, both inside and outside 
the cells. They were first described by Lustgarten in 1884, 
who found them in a number of syphilitic lesions, and who 
thereupon believed them to be the cause of that disease. 
Further work by Alvarez and Tavel, Klemperer, and 
others, showed that they were harmless saprophytes. 
They are very similar to the tubercle bacillus, but are 
more varied in size (usually distinctly shorter), at times 
slightly curved and short. They are not easily stained, 
and once stained resist decolorization by acids, but not so 
strongly as tubercle bacilli. They are said to give up the 
stain to absolute alcohol, but contradictory statements 
are made. On this basis is founded Pappenheim's method 
of staining, where a film stained with hot carbol-fuchsin 
is treated with absolute alcohol containing i per cent 
rosolic acid (corallin), methylene-blue to saturation, and 
16 per cent of glycerin. The tubercle bacilli are red, 
the bacilli smegmatis blue. They are cultivated with 
great difficulty, and first on serum or ascitic media. They 
are non-pathogenic, so far as tested. Their growth on 
media is slow (five to six days) ; the colonies are yellowish- 
white, and corrugated like tubercle bacillus colonies. 
Bacilli of the smegma group have occasionally been 
demonstrated in sputum and in secretions from the throat 
and tonsillar crypts. 

Bacillus Leprae. A bacillus closely resembling the 



286 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

tubercle bacillus in size and in acid-fastness. These bacilli 
usually stain uniformly, not showing beading. They are 
non-motile, non-flagellar, and non-sporing. They have 
not been successfully cultivated, and attempts to inoculate 
animals have failed. They are readily stained by Gram's 
method. They are found in large numbers in the cutaneous 
lesions of tubercular leprosy, and occur for the most part 
within the protoplasm of the round granulation tissue 
cells. They are also found in the lymphatic glands, and 
in smaller numbers in the liver and spleen. The spread of 
the disease is by the lymphatics. The earliest lesion is 
usually a nasal ulcer at the junction of the bony and 
cartilaginous septum. In the anaesthetic form, or nerve 
leprosy, the bacilli are found in the diffuse infiltrations in 
the nerves, rarely in the trophic lesions resulting. Lepers 
react to tuberculin, and 50 per cent are said to give the 
Wassermann reaction. The nasal mucus and saliva (in a 
less degree) are the vehicles by which the disease is spread. 
Diagnosis. Animal inoculation is negative. 

ACTINOMYCOSIS, OR THE RAY FUNGUS DISEASE. 

Actinomycosis is a disease of cattle and man. lit 
occasionally affects sheep, dogs, cats, and horses. Its 
usual sites are the regions of the face, mouth, and pharynx. 
In cattle, the lower jaw is most frequently affected, the 
disease taking the form of tumour formation, the so-called 
" lumpy jaw." The tumours are often nodulated and 
consist of fibrous tissue with irregular abscess cavities 
throughout . When an abscess discharges, the pus is of 
a yellowish-green colour, slimy in character, and contains 
small granular bodies, visible to the eye and distinctly 
palpable, and of a pale sulphur colour. These granules 
are found on examination to be composed of rosette-like 
masses of the fungus actinomyces, or ray fungus, first 
described by Boellinger in 1877. It is now classed among 
the trichomycetes or higher bacteria, and by some as a 
true mould ; that is, forms composed of threads which 
show true branching and multiply by spore-shaped bodies, 
which usually appear in chains the gonidia or spores. 
(Madura foot, or mycetoma, is similar in nature to actino- 
mycosis.) 



NON-SPOBING BACILLI 287 

Description. An anaerobe of slow growth, growing best 
at 37 C. ; and in a shake culture in glucose agar, the 
colonies are most numerous 5 to 10 mm. below the surface 
of the medium, the inference being that a trace of oxygen 
is an advantage. The colonies are round, dense, and 
greyish-white in colour (chalky) ; sometimes they are 
rosette-shaped. Another variety has been described which 
is an aerobe, growing in three to four days to little 
transparent drops, becoming later amber, and then reddish- 
yellow in colour. This variety has been grown on gelatin, 
which it liquefies. In cultures, club-shaped forms have 
not been found in the aerobic variety, but have been noted 
by J. H. Wright in the anaerobic variety when grown in 
the presence of serum or other animal fluids. It is believed 
that several kinds have been described under the one 
name, and that further research is needed to differentiate 
these. The anaerobic form grows in broth, forming heavy 
flocculent masses (solid white mulberry granules) at the 
bottom of the tube ; no clouding nor surface growth. 

The fungus is described as having three forms : 
(i) Filaments, more or less radially arranged, 0-5 micron 
thick, and closely interlaced. These form the central core 
of the colony. (2) At the periphery, refringent club-shaped 
bodies, structureless and homogeneous ; whereas the 
filaments show a sheath, enclosing a granular protoplasm. 
(3) Spores or gonidia are coccus-like bodies, found between 
the filaments of the central mass ; are variously regarded 
as real gonidia, or as degeneration products, or con- 
taminating cocci. In cultures, gonidia are developed at 
the ends of the filaments, and such gonidia have a higher 
resistance to heat than the simple filaments, half an hour 
at 75 C. being required to kill spore-bearing cultures, and 
the same time at 65 C. for spore-free cultures. The 
filaments are Gram-positive and acid-fast. 

Pathogenicity. In man, the disease tends to generalize ; 
in the ox, to remain local. The point of entrance in man 
is usually by a carious tooth, by the tonsil, or by some 
abrasion. The corresponding glands are next affected, 
and later metastatic abscesses are formed in the skin and 
elsewhere. The symptoms resemble those of chronic 
tuberculosis, for which the patient is usually treated. The 



288 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

disease is acquired probably from hay, straw, and grain, 
and possibly by milk of infected cattle. An actinomyces 
has been isolated from hay and straw, and in cattle, grains 
have been found embedded in the centre of growths. 
Inoculation of the ox has produced the disease ; in the 
smaller animals, characteristic colonies and lesions may 
follow, but little growth. 

Isolation. May be easy or very difficult. The pus is 
washed in salt solution and sown in melted glucose agar. 
If much contamination is found, keep washed granules 
for several weeks in a dry state, and try again. 

SUMMARY OF THE FINAL REPORT OF THE BRITISH ROYAL 
COMMISSION ON TUBERCULOSIS ISSUED IN JUNE, 1911. 

The British Royal Commission appointed in 1901 to 
inquire into the relations of human and animal tuber- 
culosis, issued its final report in June, 1911. The 
Commission was appointed on account of the diversity 
of opinion which was manifested at the International 
Congress on Tuberculosis, held in London in 1901, when 
the statement was made by Koch that human tuberculosis 
cannot be transmitted to cattle, and that bovine tubercu- 
losis is not dangerous to man. The results of the work of 
the Commission, and of much other parallel work, are to- 
traverse directly both statements. The Final Report 
extends to about fifty pages (there are 7 volumes of an 
Appendix), and may be usefully summarized thus : 

The report is unanimous. It is based on the isolation 
of the bacilli from the lesions of the natural disease ; the 
investigation of the cultural characters of the bacilli 
isolated, and the study of their effects when introduced in 
varying doses and by several methods into different 
animals. The species of animals used have been cattle, 
rabbits, guinea-pigs, pigs, goats, chimpanzees, monkeys, 
horses, rats, mice, dogs, cats, and birds. 

The experimental methods of infection used were : 
subcutaneous, intravenous, intraperitoneal, and by feeding 
(oral). Inhalation was not tried. The findings are based 
on the researches of their own staff. 



XON-SPORING BACILLI 289 

Three types of tubercle bacilli are described : - 

(1) Bovine tubercle bacilli the only kind found in 
natural tuberculosis of cattle. 

(2) Human tubercle bacilli the kind most commonly 
found in man, but not the only kind so found. 

(3) Avian tubercle bacilli the only kind found in 
natural tuberculosis of birds. 

i- Bovine tubercle bacillus is taken as the standard 
for comparison. 

SUMMARY OF ITS CHARACTERS. (a). Cultural. Grows 
slowly on serum, and at the end of two to three weeks 
shows on surface as a thin, greyish, uniform growth, not 
wrinkled nor pigmented. According to the rate and 
luxuriance of growth on glycerin media, bovine tubercle 
bacilli may be divided into three grades. Nevertheless it is 
insisted that rate and kind of growth should not be the 
sole basis of identification as bovine type, but only when 
considered along with results of inoculation experiments. 

(b). Effects on animals. Produces characteristic effects 
when inoculated into calves and rabbits in certain doses. 

Calves : subcutaneous injection in neck of 50 mgr. of 
culture under three weeks old. causes severe general 
tuberculosis, starting at point of inoculation ; and death 
usually within eight weeks. 

Rabbits : intravenous injection of o-oi mgr. or o-i mgr. 
of culture causes generalized miliary tuberculosis, ending 
in death within 5 weeks ; intraperitoneal injection of o-i 
mgr. death in 13 to 48 days; intraperitoneal injection 
of i-o mgr. death in 10 to 38 days; subcutaneous injection 
of i mgr. death in 29 to 165 days; subcutaneous injection 
of 10 mgr. death in 28 to 101 days. 

These results are very striking and definite, and along 
with cultural tests afford a trustworthy means of recog- 
nizing bovine tubercle bacilli. Later it was considered 
sufficient to inoculate rabbits, as results are very reliable. 

(c). Other properties. Subcutaneous inoculation in very 
small doses invariably produces acute tuberculosis in the 
chimpanzee, monkey, and guinea-pig. 

In the goat, the pig, and the cat, general tuberculosis 
is readily induced. 

The rat and the mouse are highly resistant to sub- 

19 



290 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

cutaneous inoculation ; intraperitoneally, the bacilli mul- 
tiply in the body but do not produce tubercles. 

Dogs are highly resistant to subcutaneous inoculation, 
but succumb to general tuberculosis when large doses are 
given intravenously or intraperitoneally. 

In the fowl, intravenous injection of bovine tubercle 
bacilli caused death in 50 per cent, with wasting, oedema 
of lung, and pallor of liver. In a few, definite tubercles 
were found in the lungs and minute necrotic areas in the 
liver. Death is apparently due to toxaemia, as dead bacilli 
have the same effects. Intraperitoneally and intramuscu- 
larly, even in large doses, only local lesions are produced, 
and there is no dissemination. 

Horses : subcutaneously or orally, no progressive 
tuberculosis is produced. Intravenously, 10 mgr. cause 
death from acute tuberculosis in twenty days. 

(d). Stability in culture. Subcultured for long periods, 
(one case, 1487 days = 4 years), no great loss of virulence 
was found. 

2. Human tubercle bacillus. The human type is taken 
as that bacillus which has been found in the majority of 
cases of human tuberculosis. Its chief characters are : 
on serum, it grows more rapidly than the bovine type, 
hence it is called " eugonic," as opposed to " dysgonic," 
the term applied to the bovine bacillus. On glycerin 
media, the growth tends to become wrinkled; and on 
all media becomes pigmented to a greater or less extent. 
Its effects on animals place it in still greater contrast 
to the bovine type. 

Calves : subcutaneous injection in neck of 50 mgr. 
of culture under three weeks old, does not produce pro- 
gressive tuberculosis, nor does it kill. Only a local lesion 
results, which later becomes fibrous. In about half the 
cases, the infection did not extend beyond the nearest glands. 

Rabbits : intravenous injection of o-i mgr. to I mgr. 
of culture causes slowly progressive tuberculosis with 
limited lesions, and death (for the majority) after three 
months (thirteen weeks). Intraperitoneally, I mgr. ; 
animal alive after three months. Subcutaneous injection 
of i to 100 mgr. ; animals survived or were killed in 
94 to 725 days. In certain cases i mgr. or o-i mgr. intra- 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 291 

venously acted like the bovine type, killing with acute and 
rapid tuberculosis ; in these cases, however, o-oi mgr. never 
killed within three months, thus easily distinguishing the 
bacilli from those taken as the standard. Hence this dose 
is the best to use intravenously. 

Effects on chimpanzee and monkey in producing acute 
tuberculosis, are similar to those produced by like doses of 
the bovine tubercle bacillus. 

In guinea-pigs, it produces acute tuberculosis, but dura- 
tion of life is longer than with the same dose of bovine 
tubercle bacilli. 

In the goat, pig, and cat, great resistance is found, only 
slight retrogressive lesions being produced. 

In the dog, the effects are similar to the bovine tubercle 
bacillus, that is, there is great resistance to subcutaneous 
injection, but large doses given intravenously or intra- 
peritoneally cause generalized tuberculosis and death. 

In the fowl, the effects are the same as those produced 
by the bovine tubercle bacillus. 

In a horse, subcutaneous injection of 50 mgr. produced 
only local disease. 

The human tubercle bacillus has not shown any alteration 
in cultural characters on prolonged cultivation. 

RESUME. The human tubercle bacillus is distinguished 
from the bovine tubercle bacillus by (i) Its more feady 
growth on artificial media ; and (2) The results of inocula- 
tion into rabbits, calves, cats, pigs, and goats. They 
are alike in that they readily produce tuberculosis in 
chimpanzees, monkeys, and guinea-pigs, and in that 
the lesions produced in these animals are the same in 
distribution and structure. 

3. Avian tubercle bacillus. The avian tubercle bacillus 
forms a slimy, whitish growth, easily emulsified (difference 
from human and bovine). It grows badly on serum, but 
especially well on glycerinated media. Inoculation into 
animals produces effects markedly contrasting with those 
given by bovine and human tubercle bacilli. 

Fowls are very susceptible to intravenous, intramuscular, 
and subcutaneous inoculation of the avian tubercle bacilli, 
and also to feeding. In the former modes, the lesions are 
in the spleen and liver, and frequently in the lungs, cervical 



292 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

glands, muscles, and bones. After the feeding method, 
there are similar lesions, with, in addition, characteristic 
tuberculous lesions in the mucous membrane of the 
intestines. 

Parrots show similar results, but by feeding method 
do not so regularly show intestinal lesions. Parrots are 
susceptible to both the bovine and human tubercle bacilli, 
by inoculation and feeding ; the effects are similar to those 
produced by the avian type, except that the bovine type 
is apparently the most virulent for parrots. 

The rabbit and the mouse are the only two mammals 
in which the avian tubercle bacillus causes progressive 
tuberculosis. 

Rabbits : moderately large doses, by inoculation, 
produce a fatal issue ; the bacillus is less virulent than 
bovine tubercle bacillus, but more virulent than human 
tubercle bacillus. The distribution of the lesions differs 
most markedly from that set up by the bovine and human 
types. Intravenously, I to 10 mgr. lead to speedy death, 
with great multiplication of the bacilli in the organs, which 
show general pallor ; slight oedema of the lungs, slight 
enlargement (with tubercles) of the spleen. If the animal 
lives four to five weeks, the spleen is greatly enlarged owing 
to formation of tubercles, and tubercles are found in the 
liver ^nd to a less extent in the lungs. In o-ooi mgr. dose, 
the disease is very chronic, and resembles that produced 
by subcutaneous injection, the joints being affected. Sub- 
cutaneous injection of doses of 50 mgr. down to a fraction 
of i mgr. causes very chronic disease, and the lesions have 
the same distribution, irrespective of size of dose : local 
lesion and nearest lymphatic glands ; liver and spleen 
rarely affected ; kidneys vary ; but most commonly and 
characteristically there is a tuberculosis of the joints of 
the limbs, which runs a chronic course. Joint tuberculosis 
occasionally follows intravenous injection of human 
tubercle bacillus, but has not been observed after sub- 
cutaneous injection of the rabbit with the human virus. 
It has however been noted after subcutaneous injection 
of the bovine type, when the animal survives for a long 
period, i.e., the disease is chronic. By feeding, similar 
lesions are produced, with local intestinal ones. 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 293 

Mouse : General tuberculosis by subcutaneous or 
intraperitoneal injection, and by feeding. 

Calf, pig, goat, monkey, guinea-pig, horse, cat, and rat : 
all behave alike to the avian type. It never produces a 
progressive tuberculosis, but may kill them in a large dose 
given intravenously. 

Dogs : are immune intravenously. 

Chimpanzee: injected subcutaneously with 50 mgr. 
showed no lesion on death three years after. 

Vitality in Culture. The bacillus was found alive in cul- 
ture after 1067 days (nearly 3 years) . 

Chemical Properties. The investigators were unable 
to detect any definite and constant bio-chemical character 
by which tubercle bacilli of one type can be differen- 
tiated from those of nother. 

BOVINE TUBERCULOSIS. No further special investi- 
gation has been taken beyond that recorded in the second 
Interim Report, where in 30 cases of the natural disease in 
bovines, only one form or type of Bacillus tuberculosis was 
found. 

HUMAN TUBERCULOSIS. In all, 128 cases of all 
forms of tuberculosis in man were investigated. Twenty 
of these were of lupus, and are treated separately because 
the recognition of the type of bacillus was surrounded 
with special difficulties. The 108 cases remaining are 
tabulated in full in the Report, and briefly in Table I., 
page 294. 

Of the cases of primary abdominal tuberculosis, the ages 
at death were as shown in Table II., p. 294. Twenty-four^ 
of the deaths were from some form of tuberculosis, the' 
others from non-tuberculous affections. Of 15 of these 
cases, in which a plurality of lesions were examined on 
exactly parallel lines, 9 yielded none but human tubercle 
bacilli. In 12 cases in which a single lesion in each instance 
was examined (mesenteric glands in n, cervical gland in i), 
4 yielded human and 8 bovine tubercle bacilli. Two cases 
yielded mixed human and bovine types, in one from the 
mesenteric glands alone, and in the other, also from the 
retroperitoneal glands. 

The cervical gland cases show 3 bovine infections out of

Lupus. Out^of 20 cases investigated, the virus was 
decided to be bovine in 9 cases, and to be the human 
type in ii. All but three of the cases presented difficulty 
in the detection of the type of bacilli. One was 
undoubtedly bovine by the already decided-on tests, two 
were likewise human ; but the remaining 17 furnished 
bacilli which conformed to the one type in some particulars 
and to the other in other particulars. Thus the other 
8 finally called bovine showed the cultural characters of 
that type, but a lowered virulence for the calf and also 
for the rabbit, monkey, and guinea-pig. Two had their 
virulence raised by passage through the calf and rabbit, 
bringing it up to that of the bovine type. Those ascribed 
to the human type (n), but not typically so, had lowered 
virulence for all the test animals or some of them. The 
general result therefore seems to point to the existence of 
bacilli outside the types chosen ; these may be new types, 
or members of the other types with degraded virulence. 

Tuberculosis in Swine. In 59 cases investigated of 



296 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

tuberculosis of all kinds in swine, the bovine virus was 
found in 50 cases, the human in 3, the avian in 5, and a 
mixed avian and bovine virus in i case. 

In 33 of these cases the tuberculosis was generalized, 
and in 32 of these the infection was bovine, the other 
being the one of mixed bovine and avian infection. The 
other 26 cases showed local tuberculosis. 

CONCLUSIONS : All three types of bacilli are capable of 
infecting the pig, but the bovine bacillus is the one much 
most frequently found, and in many instances it produces 
a severe and generalized disease. 

Tuberculosis in Horses. In most cases of tuberculosis 
in horses it is primarily an affection of the glands and 
organs in connection with the alimentary tract ; the 
abdominal organs chiefly. This was so in the five cases 
investigated. In all, bacilli were recovered which were of 
the bovine type culturally ; and three of them also had 
the bovine virulence. The other two had diminished 
virulence for the test animals in the test doses ; passage 
experiments raised this to that of the bovine virus. 

Tuberculosis in other Animals. In a gnu which 
died from generalized tuberculosis in the London Zoological 
Gardens, the human virus only was found. 

In an antelope, killed when ill, in the same Gardens, 
where it had been many years in captivity, extensive 
tuberculosis, with cavities in the lungs, was found. The 
human virus alone was isolated. 

In a rhesus monkey, killed when ill at the quarantine 
station at Isleworth, tuberculosis of the lungs was found, 
and some elsewhere. Here too only the human virus 
could be got. 

A chimpanzee died of acute miliary tuberculosis at the 
quarantine station. The tuberculosis started from the 
alimentary tract, and from a mesenteric gland the human 
virus was obtained. 

A cat, suffering from naturally acquired tuberculosis, 
was investigated. A mesenteric gland gave a bacillus of 
the bovine type in growth and virulence. 

Tuberculosis in Birds. In g cases investigated 
(3 fowls, 3 pheasants, i pigeon, i demoiselle crane, I 
Senegal touracou) of tuberculosis occurring naturally in 



XOX-SPORIXG BACILLI 297 

birds, in every one the virus found was of the avian type. 

In tuberculosis in pigs, the avian virus was found on 
6 occasions in the submaxillary lymphatic glands ; in 
5 alone, and in i case in association with the bovine virus. 

(Query. Is this due to special exposure of the pig to the 
farmyard dust, and to its high body temperature ?) 

Behaviour of the Bacilli and their Fate in the 
Tissues of Inoculated Animals. From a number of 
experiments detailed, the Reporters conclude that after 
subcutaneous inoculation of human and bovine viruses, 
rapid and abundant distribution of bacilli over the body 
takes place, provided the dose is large and the tissue condi- 
tions of the animal such as to allow the inoculation to take 
full effect. This is essentially a mechanical dispersion by 
the blood and lymph channels of a considerable proportion 
of injected bacilli, and occurs speedily after their insertion. 
The resulting acute tuberculosis is at first in strong contrast 
to the similar but more slowly developing generalized 
disease induced by smaller experimental doses, or such as 
occurs most commonly in nature. This more slowly 
developing form is due to a dispersion of bacilli, but not 
necessarily those primarily invading the animal ; more pro- 
bably their progeny, which have been able to get through 
the barriers and into the blood-stream. 

Feeding Experiments. In two pigs fed with large 
doses of bovine virus, the bacilli were demonstrated (by 
inoculation of guinea-pigs) in the submaxillary and mes- 
enteric glands and lungs in seven and thirteen days after 
ingestion, but not in the other organs. In seven pigs fed 
with human virus, in from two to twelve days after 
ingestion the same distribution was proved in two ; in 
the other five the virus was found in the glands alone. 
In a goat, eight days after ingestion of human bacilli, 
they were found in the submaxillary glands, mesenteric 
glands, and lung. In a cat fed with the same bacilli, 
in nine days they were found in the submaxillary 
and mesenteric glands, lung, liver, and spleen. Three 
rhesus monkeys, each fed with 50 mgr. of human tubercle 
bacilli, were killed ; I in two days, showed no bacilli in 
the glands or internal organs ; i in four days, showed 
bacilli in the mesenteric glands, liver, spleen, and lungs 



298 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

and the third in six days, showed bacilli in the sub- 
maxillary and mesenteric glands and spleen, the lung 
condition, owing to the premature death of the guinea- 
pigs used for the test, not being determined. 

Excretion of tubercle bacilli in milk was tested by 
injection of cultures into healthy cows and goats. 

Subcutaneous injection of 100 mgr. of bovine culture into 
a healthy milch cow caused its death thirty days later of 
general tuberculosis. The udder was normal both to the 
naked eye and on microscopical examination, yet guinea- 
pigs fed with the animal's milk, by the end of the first week 
after injection and subsequently, developed tuberculosis. 

Two other cows were injected with human tubercle 
bacilli. One received 100 mgr. subcutaneously ; tubercle 
bacilli were recovered from her milk in twenty-four 
hours, and the milk in small doses caused tuberculosis in 
guinea-pigs at every time of testing right up to 155 days 
later, when the cow was killed and the udder was found 
normal. The other received 10 mgr. intravenously, and the 
milk contained the bacilli in twenty-four hours and up to 
fourteen days later, but not subsequently. The animal 
was killed in 182 days, and showed no tuberculous lesions. 

Six milch goats were similarly tested with bovine and 
human bacilli, with confirmatory results. 

In 12 experiments on heifers, subcutaneous injection of 
human virus (2), lupus virus (8), and bovine virus (2), in 
50 to 100 mgr. doses, the heifers were killed in 62 to 127 
days afterwards, and in eight cases tubercle bacilli were 
found in the sinuses of the undeveloped udder of the 
animals ; in four, in such numbers as to suggest multipli- 
cation in these sinuses. 

Modification of Bacilli. Tests by cultural processes 
and by long-continued passage through animals have 
failed to effect any change of type from bovine to human, 
bovine to avian, human to avian, and vice versa. Certain 
difficulties were encountered with bacilli in lupus and in 
the horse, but while the Reporters think that further 
investigations may possibly disclose additional variations 
in the types of bacilli, they do not as a result of their 
investigations feel disposed to add a plurality of new 
types to the three already described by them. They are 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 299 

not prepared to deny that the transmutation of one type 
into another may occur in nature, in view of the instances 
in which one and the same human body yielded both 
types. 

Replies to the Terms of Reference. The questions 
referred to them for investigation and report were as 
follows : 

(i) " Whether the disease in animals and in man is one and 
the same. (2) Whether animals and man can be recipro- 
cally infected with it. (3) Under what conditions, if at 
all, the transmission of the disease from animals to man 
takes place, and what are the circumstances favourable 
or unfavourable to such transmission." 

i. Morphologically, as grown on serum, the human and 
bovine types described are indistinguishable, but they are 
appreciably different in respect of their cultural characters 
and their capacity for causing disease in various species 
of animals. The question of the identity or non-identity 
of these two types clearly depends therefore upon the 
importance which it is permissible to attach to their 
cultural and pathogenic differences, and this depends on 
the fixity or variability of the differences in question. 
Though in the investigations no case was observed in which 
the mode of growth of one type was so modified that 
it was indistinguishable from the mode of growth of the 
other type, yet the bacilli referred to as the bovine type 
show so much variety among themselves as to luxuriance 
of growth, that the gap which separates those of that group 
which grow most luxuriantly from the human type, is 
not a wide one. 

Again, as regards pathogenicity, it is more a matter of 
degree than of difference. The bovine tubercle bacillus 
produces a fatal tuberculosis in cattle, rabbits, guinea- 
pigs, chimpanzees, monkeys, goats, and pigs. The human 
tubercle bacillus readily produces a fatal tuberculosis in 
guinea-pigs, chimpanzees, and monkeys, and in large 
doses, only slight and non-progressive lesions in cattle, 
goats, and pigs. Its effects on rabbits are not uniform, 
for while in the majority of cases these animals are 
only slightly affected, in some cases extensive and fatal 
tuberculosis results. 



300 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

In other words, guinea-pigs, chimpanzees, and monkeys 
are all highly susceptible to the effects of human or bovine 
tubercle bacillus ; and the diseases produced in these 
animals by both types are histologically and anatomically 
identical. 

In man, experiment is not permissible, and no oppor- 
tunity has offered of generalized disease set up by accidental 
infection with the bovine tubercle bacillus. Nevertheless 
many cases of fatal tuberculosis caused by the bovine 
tubercle bacillus and nothing else have been investigated. 
Compared with parallel cases caused by the human tubercle 
bacillus, the two groups of cases were alike in their clinical 
histories and their fatal termination, and were indis- 
tinguishable anatomically when the lesions were examined 
after death. Man must therefore be added to the list of 
animals notably susceptible to bovine tubercle bacilli. 

Are these two types, then, varieties of the same organism ? 
This is the conclusion, in spite of the failure to transmute 
the one into the other. And, as a corollary, the lesions 
they produce, whether in man or in other mammals, are 
manifestations of the same disease. Whatever difference 
of opinion may be held on this conclusion, in a considerable 
proportion of cases of human tuberculosis the disease is 
one and the same as bovine tuberculosis, being caused by 
bacilli which are in every respect indistinguishable from 
the bacilli which are the cause of tuberculosis in cattle. 
In all such cases therefore the disease must unquestionably 
be pronounced as one and the same. 

As regards avian tuberculosis, there does not appear to 
be sufficient evidence at present to answer the question in 
the affirmative. 

2. The conclusion reached is that, excluding the fowl 
and other birds, mammals and man can be reciprocally 
infected with tuberculosis. The transmission to man has 
been conclusively shown by the study of fatal cases of 
tuberculosis, mostly in children ; and from man to 
mammals, by feeding experiments. 

3. Conclusions : 

(i.) Unmodified avian tubercle bacillus is a negligible 
factor in the production of human tuberculosis. 

(ii.) It cannot be affirmed with confidence that man is 



NON-SPORIXG BACILLI 301 

wholly free from risk of infection, through animal food, 
with that type of bacillus to which he is most prone, 
namely the human type ; though the degree of danger to 
him in this sense must for the present remain undetermined. 
The pig, though experimentally it fostered human bacilli 
in a minor degree only, may have to be regarded as a 
possible source of this kind of infection, since particular 
glands of the pig's body, in which human tubercle bacilli 
have occasionally been found, are likely to enter into 
certain prepared foods. 

(iii.) (a) The pig is a potential source of infection of man 
with bovine tubercle bacilli. This bacillus was present in 
50 + 1 cases of tuberculosis in pigs, out of 59 cases of 
tuberculosis investigated. In 32 + 1 of these cases, it 
caused generalized tuberculosis, and in 18 cases, local 
tuberculosis. (The + i case was one of mixed bovine and 
avian infection.) There is no reason to suppose that the 
bovine tubercle bacilli are rendered less infective to human 
beings by previous residence in the tissues of the pig. 

(b) The actual number of cases representing the various 
clinical manifestations of tuberculosis commonly found in 
man, on which the conclusions are based, is 128. So far 
as these have been examples of tuberculosis in adults, 
and especially when they have been cases of pulmonary 
tuberculosis, the lesions of the disease, when fatal, have 
been referable to the human tubercle bacillus, with but 
few exceptions. 

In human abdominal tuberculosis, the experience has 
been very different, especially as regards children. Of 
young children, dying of primary abdominal tuberculosis, 
the fatal lesions could be referred to the bovine tubercle 
bacillus, and it alone, in nearly one-half of the cases. 

In cervical-gland tuberculosis, in children, and often 
also in adolescents, a large proportion of the cases examined 
could be referred to the bovine tubercle bacillus. 

In lupus, too, in the cases examined occurring in 
adolescents and children, the amount of infection with 
the bovine type was marked. 

Whatever therefore may be the animal source of 
infection with the bovine type of bacillus in adult and 
adolescent mankind, there can be no doubt that a consider- 



302 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

able proportion of the tuberculosis affecting children is 
of bovine origin, more particularly that which affects 
primarily the abdominal organs and the cervical glands, 
and further that primary abdominal tuberculosis, as well 
as tuberculosis of the cervical glands, is commonly due to 
ingestion of tuberculous infective material. 

In what way are children most likely to obtain a large 
and fatally infective dose of tubercle bacilli ? To this 
question there can be but one answer, namely, the evidence 
accumulated goes to demonstrate that a considerable 
amount of tuberculosis in children is to be ascribed to 
infection with bacilli of the bovine type, transmitted in 
meals consisting largely of the milk of the cow. 

The child may be subjected to this feeding with infective 
material, and not develop a fatal tuberculosis ; but still be 
injured, although it recover. Many cases of abdominal 
tuberculosis in children recover, and the proportion of 
bovine to human bacilli in these has not been estimated ; 
and of cervical-gland tuberculosis, nearly all make some 
kind of recovery, with varying degrees of disfigurement ; 
and a similar statement may be applied to lupus. 

In adult and adolescent mankind (excluding lupus, in 
which, out of 10 cases, three yielded bacilli culturally 
bovine but with less virulence for the calf and rabbit than 
the bovine tubercle bacillus), fatal lesions due to bovine 
bacilli have been found, rarely in adolescents, and extremely 
rarely in adults. Yet, although of 55 cases scrutinized of 
tuberculosis in adults and adolescents, only 5 yielded 
bovine bacilli, it cannot be said that this figure adequately 
represents the proportion of like cases among the tubercu- 
lous population generally. 

In view of the evidence adduced, the following pronounce- 
ments on administrative measures required at present to 
obtain security against transmission of bovine tubercle 
bacilli by means of food, are called for : 

In the interests of infants and children, and for the reasonable 
safeguarding of the public health generally, it is urged that 
existing regulations and supervision of milk production and 
meat preparation be not relaxed. 

On the contrary, Government should cause to be enforced 



NON-SPORING BACILLI 303 

throughout the kingdom food regulations, planned to afford 
better security against the infection of human beings through 
the medium of articles of diet derived from tuberculous animals. 
More particularly it is urged that action in this sense should 
be taken, in order to avert or minimize the present danger 
arising from the consumption of infected milk. 

Certain facts observed in reference to the elimination of 
bovine tubercle bacilli by the cow in her milk, are of such 
importance that they formed the subject of the third 
Interim Report, and deserve repetition here. 

1. Bovine tubercle bacilli are apt to be abundantly 
present in milk, as sold to the public, when there is 
tuberculous disease of the udder of the cow from which 
it has been obtained. This fact is generally recognized, 
though not adequately guarded against. 

2. Bovine tubercle bacilli may also be present in the 
milk of tuberculous cows presenting no evidence whatever 
of disease of the udder, even when examined post mortem. 

3. In tuberculous cows, the milk leaving the udder may 
not contain tubercle bacilli, and yet it may and frequently 
does become infective by contamination with the faeces or 
uterine discharges of such diseased animal. 

Convinced that measures for securing the prevention of the 
ingestion of living bovine tubercle bacilli with milk would greatly 
reduce the number of cases of abdominal and cervical gland 
tuberculosis in children, the Reporters advise that such measures 
should include the exclusion from the food supply of the milk 
of the recognizably tuberculous cow, irrespective of the site of 
the disease, whether in the udder or in the internal organs. 

(A memorandum is appended in which reference is 
made to immunity experiments, on which no opinion is 
expressed, but which are fully reported in Vol. iii. of 
Appendix to this Report ; and to several other subsidiary 
experiments.) 



CHAPTER XIV. 

SPORING BACILLI. 

SPORING bacilli are comprised in two groups : 

1. A erobic (facultative anaerobes). Non-motile : anthrax, 
anthracoides and radicosus. Sluggishly motile : mycoides, 
ramosus, vulgatus, mesentericus. Actively motile : subtilis, 
megatherium. 

All the above are Gram-positive ; gelatin-liquefying ; 
non-indol-forming, and non-gas-forming in glucose or 
lactose ; coagulate milk slowly with little acid and then 
digest the clot ; digest blood serum. 

2. Anaerobic (strictly). Subcutaneous injection into 
animals causes : 

(i). No particular symptoms at site of inoculation, but 
absorption of the soluble toxin causing (a) general 
symptoms of tetanus, B. tetani ; (b) botulism, pupillary 
symptoms, paralysis of tongue and pharynx, cardiac and 
respiratory failure, B. botulinus. 

(ii). Local symptoms marked at the site of inoculation, 
causing haemorrhagic emphysematous oedema ; (a) motile ; 
spores oval and central, B. oedematis maligni ; spores oval 
and excentric, B. anthracis symptomatici ; spore near one 
end, B. enteritidis sporogenes ; (b) non-motile ; B. aerogenes 
capsulatus of Welch and Nuttall. 

SPORE-BEARING AEROBIC BACILLI. 

Bacillus Anthracis is the cause of anthrax, a disease 
primarily of the herbivora, cattle and sheep, but occurring 
also in horses, pigs, and goats. Man is susceptible, and 
contracts it either directly from the living or dead animal, 
or from hides, wool, horse-hair, or dust arising from these. 
It assumes two forms, external anthrax pr malignant 
pustule, and internal anthrax which in man takes the 
form of wool-sorter's disease and the form of intestinal 
anthrax, in which the symptoms are more like those of 
acute poisoning. 

In human anthrax, bacterial invasion of the blood only 



SPORING BACILLI 305 

occurs late in the disease ; in animals, on the contrary, the 
blood-invasion is early. 

The Algerian sheep and the white -rat have a high degree 
of immunity. Pollender first described the anthrax 
bacillus as occurring in the blood of animals succumbing 
to splenic fever. Rayer and Davaine repeated the 
observation in 1850 (a year later) ; Brauell, in 1857, found 
the bacilli in the blood of a man affected with anthrax, 
and Davaine gave everything but absolute proof that they 
were the exciting cause of anthrax. Koch, by succeeding 
in getting a pure culture on the aqueous humour of an ox's 
eye, was able to prove its specificity. He also added 
largely to the knowledge of its life-history, and particularly 
to the mode of formation of spores. 

Description. B. anthracis is a straight rod, non-motile, 
with square or concave ends, 4-5 to 10 micra long by i to 
1-5 micron thick ; forming chains in cultures, and sporing 
by oval spores one to each rod ; placed about the centre of 
the bacillus, and of about the same diameter, and highly 
refractile. Gram-positive ; gelatin-liquefying, and said at 
times to possess a capsule when recovered from tissues or 
blood, or grown on latter. 

Cultures. Grows well on all media, best at 37-5 C., 
but also from 12 to 45 C. 

In broth : a heavy flocculent sediment, slight pellicle, 
remainder clear. 

In gelatin stab : an invreted fir-tree growth, with gradual 
fluidification. 

In gelatin plate : colonies develop within 24 to 48 hours 
as opaque white pin-head discs, later becoming larger and 
less regular, and under the microscope showing a hair-like 
tangle of threads the so-called Medusa head. 

In agar plate : the colonies magnified thirty times show 
wavy wreaths like locks of hair, the whole colony being 
probably one long thread. Such colonies are very suit- 
able for making impression preparations, and in such the 
wreaths are seen to be made up of bundles of long filaments 
lying parallel with one another, each filament consisting of 
a chain of bacilli. 

On potato : a thick white felted mass, useful for studying 
porulation.

306 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Spores. Only produced in the presence of oxygen 
(free), and hence not formed in blood of infected animals 
while in the unopened vessels or tissues. For this reason 
it is advised to cut into an animal dead of anthrax as 
little as possible, and to be specially careful not to spill 
the blood. The spores are very resistant, keeping for 
twenty years. They are killed by dry heat at 140 C. 
(248 F.) in 3 hours, and live steam at 100 C. in 5 to 10 
minutes, or boiling water for i hours. Their behaviour to 
chemical disinfectants is variable, some strains resisting 
1-20 carbolic acid for forty days, while others are destroyed 
by the same solution in two days. Corrosive sublimate, 
1-2000, kills most strains in 40 minutes. Direct sunlight 
destroys anthrax spores within 6 to 12 hours. Creolin (10 
per cent) kills anthrax bacilli in 10 to 20 minutes, but 
anthrax spores can survive in a 60 per cent solution of 
creolin. Freezing has little effect on their vitality. Spores 
are formed best at 30 C., and by keeping the bacilli at 
42 C. for eight days, the power of sporulation is lost, and 
is only regained by passing the bacilli through a series of 
animals. 

Anthrax spores are often used for testing the value of 
" germicides." To do this, sterile silk threads are steeped 
in an emulsion of an anthrax culture and are dried over 
strong sulphuric acid in a desiccator. They are then 
placed in a solution of the " germicide " for a certain time, 
well washed with water, and laid on the surface of agar 
medium or dropped into broth, and incubated to see if any 
growth occurs. The culture used is first tested for spore 
formation. 

Pathogenicily. For man : great. For animals : mainly 
for cattle and sheep. In the German Empire in 1899, the 
following cases were reported : 3678 cattle, 307 sheep, 
282 horses, 61 swine, and 6 goats. 

In Great Britain, in the ten years 1896 to 1905, the 
total reported " outbreaks " in animals were 6203, and the 
number is increasing. In man, 512 cases were reported in 
1901 to 1910, and of these 120 were fatal. Internal anthrax 
is usually fatal. In the external form, head and neck cases 
show a mortality of 85 per cent ; and hand and arm cases 
12 per cent. 



SPORING BACILLI 307 

Rabbits, guinea-pigs, and white mice are all very 
susceptible, the mice most so. Rats resistant, especially 
the white rat ; dogs more so. Birds are highly immune, 
also amphibians (but toads are said to be very susceptible). 

Toxins. No toxins have yet been isolated, though it is 
highly probable that both extra- and intra-cellular toxins 
exist. 

Vaccination. In France, a death-rate from anthrax of 
10 per cent among sheep and 5 per cent among cattle 
compelled attention to the problem of providing protection. 
Pasteur, in 1881, introduced his method by the use of two 
vaccines : (i) A broth culture of bacilli, whose virulence 
was reduced by being incubated at 42 C. for twenty-four 
days, and so made non-fatal to guinea-pigs but still fatal 
to white mice premier vaccin ; (2) A broth culture, incu- 
bated as above for twelve days, which would kill guinea- 
pigs but not rabbits deuxieme vaccin. 

A sheep was inoculated in the subcutaneous tissues on 
the inner side of the thigh with 5 drops of the premier 
vaccin. Twelve days later a similar inoculation of the 
deuxieme vaccin was given, and fourteen days later still 
an injection of an ordinary virulent culture produced no 
ill result. The method has given excellent results, and 
the immunity lasts about a year. 

Passive Immunization. Sclavo produced a serum from 
highly immunized asses, which has strongly protective 
and curative properties, and is used in the treatment of 
anthrax in man. In malignant pustule, four doses of 10 c.c. 
are injected into the abdominal wall, and if necessary 
repeated on the following day. Sclavo does not advise 
excision of the pustule. Sobernheim uses serum from 
sheep. 

Isolation of B. anthracis from hairs, etc. : Add 5 grm. 
to broth and shake. Incubate : not a pure culture. Heat 
to 80 C. for 30 minutes ; all non-sporing organisms killed. 
Take twenty samples of i c.c. on agar and grow. Infect 
animals and see if pathogenic. Plate again on second day. 

Diagnosis. 1. In a cass suspected to be malignant 
pustule, diagnose by (i) Making films from the fluid in the 
vesicles or from scrapings, and staining with watery methy- 
lene-blue, and also by Gram (be careful in scraping a pustule 



308 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

before excision, not to manipulate it roughly, or bacteria 
may enter the circulation) ; (2) Making cultures from 
similar material, by successive strokes on agar tubes or 
plates ; (3) Inoculation of the cultures into a guinea-pig 
or mouse, subcutaneously. If anthrax bacilli are present 
the animal usually dies within two days, and post 
mortem the tissues around the site of inoculation show 
intense inflammatory cedema, swelling, and gelatinous 
change, with small haemorrhages. On microscopic exami- 
nation, numerous bacilli are seen. The internal organs 
show congestion and cloudy swelling, and sometimes 
small haemorrhages, and their capillaries contain enor- 
mous numbers of bacilli, so that they appear as if 
injected with them. The spleen is notably enlarged 
(especially in the ox dead of anthrax, being two to three 
times its natural size, hence the name "splenic fever"), 
is of a dark-red colour, and on section is soft and friable, 
at times almost diffluent. Films from the pulp contain 
enormous numbers of bacilli mixed with red cells and 
leucocytes of the lymphocyte and large mononuclear 
varieties. The lymphatic system is generally much 
affected, the glands and vessels being swollen and containing 
bacilli in very great numbers. The intestines are 
enormously congested, the epithelium is more or less 
desquamated, and the lumen filled with a bloody fluid. 
(Muir and Ritchie.) 

2. Methylene-blue Reaction. Depends on the disintegra- 
tion of the capsules of the bacilli, which occurs when these 
are imperfectly fixed. It serves for the easy recognition 
of anthrax bacilli in blood and other bodily fluids, where 
putrefactive and other bacilli are present. Dry a loopful 
of blood on a slide ; hold it for one second in the flame ; 
repeat three times. Stain for a few seconds in old solution 
of methylene-blue, wash in water, and dry. Examine dry 
and without a cover-glass, when between and near the 
bacteria, violet or reddish-purple tinted granular or 
amorphous matter is seen. (M'Fadyean's test.) 

Capsules can be demonstrated in smear preparations 
from organs, by staining in 2 per cent watery solution of 
methylene-violet (heating). Wash in water for 2 seconds. 
Wash in i per cent acetic for 6 to 10 seconds. Wash in 



SPORING BACILLI 309 

water and examine in water-drop. Another method is to 
stain (without fixing film) in a cold saturated solution of 
gentian-violet in formalin. Examine in water-drop. 

Prevention of Anthrax. The Home Office Order No. 1293, 
dated Dec. I2th, 1905, on this subject, is made under 
Section 79 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901. It 
provides for the prevention of dust from wool or hair by 
ordering the opening and sorting to be done only (i) after 
steeping in water ; or (2) over an efficient opening screen, 
with mechanical exhaust draught, in a room set apart for 
the purpose and in which no other work than opening is 
carried on. Mohair, other than Van mohair, only needs 
to be sorted over a down draught. Van mohair, Persian 
locks, and Persian, must all be steeped before being 
opened. Alpaca, pelitan, East Indian cashmere, Russian 
camelhair, Pekin camelhair and Persian [or so-called Per-

Anthrax orders are issued by the Board of Agriculture 
under the Diseases of Animals Act, 1894, and provide for 
the precautions to be used in treatment of a sick animal, 
and (i) the burial at a depth of not less than 6 ft., with i ft. 
of lime beneath and above the carcase of an animal dead 
of anthrax, or (2) the destruction of a dead animal by 
heat or chemical agents. The local authority must carry 
out the provisions of the order in these and other 
particulars. 

Bacteria closely resembling B. Anthracis : 

1. B. Anthracoides. A Gram-positive bacillus; ends 
more rounded than those of B. anthracis ; growth more 
rapid ; gelatin liquefaction more rapid ; non-pathogenic. 
Otherwise indistinguishable from B. anthracis. 

2. B. Radicosus. Cultivated from water-supplies. 



310 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Larger, and more variation in size of individuals ; grows 
best at room temperature ; non-pathogenic. 

3- B. Subtilis. The common bacillus of hay infusion, 
and found as a saprophyte in old wounds and infected 
sinuses ; gives a heavy tenacious pellicle in broth ; spores 
germinate equatorially ; gelatin and casein are liquefied 
more rapidly than by B. anthracis ; is actively motile in 
young cultures ; non-pathogenic. Pathogenicity for man 
is now alleged, it having been isolated from a case of 
panophthalmitis in pure culture. 

4. B. Mycoides (earth bacillus). Is obtained from the 
surface of the earth of cultivated fields or gardens. Grows 
best at 18 C., and on gelatin shows a mould-like growth. 
About the size of B. anthracis, which it resembles greatly. 
Grows in threads ; motile ; non-pathogenic. 

5- B. Megatherium. 10 micra x 2-5 micra. First 
found on boiled cabbage leaves. 

6. B. Vulgatus (potato bacillus). Grows rapidly on 
potatoes, showing marked wrinkling. Small thick rods 
with rounded ends, in pairs or fours. 

SPORE-BEARING ANAEROBIC BACILLI. 

METHODS OF ANAEROBIC CULTURE. 

1. Liquid media : Boil vigorously for 15 minutes, to 
drive out dissolved oxygen ; cool, and put layer of sterile 
oil on surface. (Pasteur.) 

2. Piece of sterile mica on surface of agar or gelatin 
plates. (Koch.) 

3. Deep inoculation in solid media, recently boiled for 
15 minutes and cooled rapidly in ice, to prevent absorp- 
tion of oxygen. It is advantageous to have I per cent 
of glucose in medium. The tubes are inoculated by deep 
stabs, and the top of the medium is covered with a thin 
layer of agar, gelatin, or oil, and the tube capped with 
rubber or sealed with sealing-wax. (Liborius.) 

4. The solid medium may be inoculated before it 
solidifies, a " shake culture " as in the original method 
of Liborius. The colonies which develop are fished out 
after breaking the tube. 

5. Tube fitted with two-holed cork and two tubes. 



SPORING BACILLI 311 

Pass in H or N until all the air is displaced, and then seal 
ends of tubes in flame. 

6. Buchner's Tube. A wide tube with a constriction 
near the closed end, so that an ordinary culture tube can 
be inserted and is held up by the constriction. In use, 
i grm. of solid pyrogallic acid and 20 c.c. of 10 per cent 
KOH are put into the bulb, the previously inoculated tube 
is inserted loosely plugged, and the Buchner tube is 
plugged and sealed with melted paraffin or closed with 
a rubber cap. The solution in bulb absorbs oxygen. The 
method can be used without the special tube, with a tall 
glass jar or a desiccator. It is better to add the alkali 
by pipette after the inoculated tube has been inserted. 

7. Bidloch's Method. A bell jar with an inlet and an exit 
tube, both having stopcocks. The bell jar is firmly bound 
down to a glass plate by ung. resinae. Before fixing, 
a glass dish is set on the plate, and 3 to 4 grm. of pyro- 
gallic acid are heaped to one side of it. Culture plates or 
tubes in a beaker are rested on a tripod stand placed in the 
dish. The bell jar is now fixed on so that the inlet tube 
will end in the dish at the side away from the pyrogallol. 
Hydrogen is passed in, and then a solution of KOH 
(109 grm. in 145 c.c.). 

8. Vacuum Method. Desiccator with stopcock. Exhaust 
air by burning alcohol on soaked filter-paper put into jar. 
Stopcock is needed to release pressure when opening. 

B. Tetani. 

The cause of tetanus or lockjaw, a disease characterized 
by the gradual onset of general stiffness and spasms of the 
voluntary muscles, beginning in the jaw muscles and those 
of the back of the neck. The disease is usually associated 
with a wound received four to fourteen days previously and 
infected with earth or dung. The majority of cases are fatal. 

Kitasato first isolated the bacillus (in 1889) and in 
this fashion : Pus from the local suppuration of mice 
inoculated from a human case, was smeared upon the 
surface of agar slants. These were permitted to develop 
at 37 C. for 24 to 48 hours. At the end of this time the 
cultures were subjected to a temperature of 80 C. for 
i hour. This destroyed all non-sporulating bacteria as 



312 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

well as aerobic spore-bearers which had developed into the 
vegetative form. Agar plates were then inoculated from 
the slants and incubated in a hydrogen atmosphere, and 
on these tetanus bacilli grew. Rosenbach had previously 
pointed out the terminal spore formation of B. tetani, 
and Nicolaier had described the bacillus, but could not 
grow it in pure culture. 

Description. A slender bacillus, 2 to 5 micra long x 
0-3 to 0-8 micron thick, with somewhat rounded ends. In 
young cultures it is slightly motile, and by special staining 
numerous peritrichal flagella are seen. In 24 to 48 hours 
the bacilli develop spores which are at full size three to 
four times the thickness of the bacillus in diameter, and 
are formed at one end of the bacillus. The bacillus and 
spore thus give the characteristic drumstick appearance. 
It is easily stained with the usual dyes, and is positive to 
Gram's method. Detached flagella often become massed 
together in the form of spirals, not unlike spirochaetes. In 
specimens stained with watery solutions of gentian-violet 
or methylene - blue, the bacillary protoplasm stains 
uniformly, but any spores are unstained except at the 
periphery, and so look like rings. With carbol-fuchsin and 
time, the spores become uniformly coloured. Spores 
may be found free from the bacilli in which they were 
formed. The bacillus liquefies gelatin slowly, also blood 
serum, but does not coagulate milk. It is a strict anaerobe 
(obligatory), but can be habituated to aerobic life, though 
with loss of pathogenicity and toxin-forming power. Grows 
moderately in aerobic conditions where other organisms 
which use up the oxygen supply are present (symbiosis). 
Its growth is aided in all media by slight alkalinity, 
presence of glucose, maltose, or sodium formate (i to 2 per 
cent), which act as reducing agents. With carbohydrates 
it produces acid. In gelatin and agar, moderate amounts 
of gas are produced, chiefly CO 2 ; but other substances 
which are volatile and cause a characteristically unpleasant 
odour are formed. This is described as a peculiar burnt 
odour, and as that of putrefying organic matter, and is 
said to be largely due to H 2 S and CH 3 .SH (methyl 
mercaptan). 

Cultures. In deep glucose gelatin stab : growth begins 



SPORING BACILLI 313 

one inch or so below the surface, in fine straight threads, 
radiating from the needle track. Slow liquefaction, with 
slight gas formation, takes place. 

In agar stab (glucose agar) : the growth is somewhat 
similar. 

In glucose broth : slight clouding, with later a thin 
powdery deposit on the walls of the tube. Ordinary broth 
is preferred for toxin production. 

On blood serum : growth with liquefaction takes place. 

In milk : acid is formed but no clot. 

On potato : growth is delicate. 

On agar plates : colonies show a compact centre, with 
loose feathery outline not unlike B. subtilis or anthrax. 

Spores Resist dry heat at 80 C. for i hour; live steam 
for 5 minutes ; 5 per cent acid carbolic for 12 to 15 hours ; 
i per cent corrosive sublimate for 2 to 3 hours. Direct 
sunlight diminishes their virulence and ultimately destroys 
them, otherwise they may remain virulent for years 
(in one case, n years). Are best formed at 37 C., but 
also form at 20 C. in 8 to 10 days. 

Habitat. Soil, street dust, horse-dung. 

Pathogenesis. In man : mostly from punctured wounds. 
The bacillus remains at the local site, but the toxins are 
carried to the nerve cells of the motor horns of the spinal 
cord, and of the motor ganglia of the brain. The manner 
of transmission is believed to be by absorption through 
the end-plates of the motor nerves in the muscles, and 
thence via the axis-cylinder processes to the respective 
nerve cell. The toxins have been shown to have no effect 
on the motor or sensory endings of the nerves, but solely 
as an exciter of the nerve cells concerned in reflex action 
in the cord, pons, and medulla. The affinity of the toxins 
for the nervous system varies in different animals ; in the 
guinea-pig it is its chief affinity, whereas in the alligator 
it shows no affinity, and intermediate degrees exist. 
Section ,of a nerve, e.g., the sciatic nerve, followed by 
injection of the toxins into the muscles supplied by that 
nerve, prevents the toxins reaching the spinal cord ; but 
if the nerve below the section be cut out and introduced 
into a mouse, the animal will die of tetanus. Similarly, 
infection of one side of the cord passes, when the dose is 



314 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

large, to the other side via the commissure, and up the 
cord to the higher centres. The latter extension can be 
prevented by section of the cord. Lately, in India, the 
relation between subcutaneous or intramuscular injections 
of quinine (given for malaria) and the production of tetanus 
has been worked out. Such quinine injections are apt to 
have a destructive action on the tissues, and the foci of 
dead tissue produced serve as suitable anaerobic media for 
the growth of tetanus spores. The latter are believed to 
reach these foci by absorption from the bowel. This 
explanation will also probably serve for the Mulkowal 
outbreak (1902), when 19 persons developed tetanus (out of 
107 injected) after inoculations of Haffkine's plague 
prophylactic. In India, tetanus spores seem to be present 
in the bowel in a considerable proportion of the natives. 

Toxins. Broth cultures grown anaerobically are usually 
highly toxic to animals, 0-000005 c - c - (aWznnr) or ^ ess b^ng 
fatal to a mouse of 10 grm. weight. Fatal dose for a man 
is given as 0-23 mgr., equal to 0-003 f a grain, or ^J-^. 
The maximum yield is given in 10- to I4~day-old cultures. 
After this it rapidly deteriorates. This also happens after 
separation from the bacilli by nitration, and in a few days 
it may have only y^ of its original power. Von Behring, 
who first noted this change, attributed it to the action of 
light, temperature, and especially oxygen, on the toxins ; 
and so such filtrates should be kept covered with a layer 
of toluol and in a dark, cool place. Exposure for a few 
minutes to 65 C. destroys it, as do 20 min. at 60 C. and 
1-5 hour at 55 C. Drying has no effect apart from 
temperature. It can be precipitated by over-saturation 
of the solution with ammonium sulphate, and thoroughly 
dried and stocked in vacuum tubes, together with anhydrous 
phosphoric acid, it may be preserved indefinitely without 
deterioration. The ordinary effects of the toxin are 
attributed to " tetanospasmin." Besides this, a substance 
named " tetanolysin " which has the power of destroying 
the red corpuscles of various animals, was discovered 
by Ehrlich. Tetanus toxin can be fully neutralized by 
mixing it with brain substance. 

Tetanus toxin is peculiar in that, after introduction into 
an animal's body, a definite incubation period occurs 



SPORIXG BACILLI 315 

before symptoms arise. In the guinea-pig this is thirteen 
to eighteen hours, and in the horse five days. It is shorter 
after intravenous injection, probably through getting more 
quickly to the nerve centres. Crocodiles are resistant to 
tetanus toxin. 

Immunity. Produced by injection of filtered toxin 
in increasing doses. At Elstree, the serum-producing 
department of the Lister Institute, London, the horse is 
immunized by the injection of 0-5 c.c. filtered toxin -j- 0-5 
c.c. of Lugol's solution of iodine (1-300), repeated at 
intervals of ten days, gradually increasing the dose until 
10 c.c. of unreduced toxin are given. The iodine solution 
neutralizes the toxin to some extent. The serum of such 
an immunized animal is antitoxic ; but the effect of its 
injection into an infected animal is not so good as is the 
case with diphtheria antitoxin, because the tetanus is 
mainly bound to the nervous tissue and is thus less 
susceptible to the action of the antitoxin. Von Behring 
believes that there is no hope of its being useful after 
symptoms have existed for 30 hours, but MacConkey and 
Green say that if much larger doses were used better 
results would be got in the human subject, comparable with 
those reported in horses. The serum is standardized so 
that i grm. will protect 100.000,000 grm. weight of mouse 
(v. Behring), or 1,000,000,000 grm. weight (Pasteur 
Institute). Of this 100 c.c. are advised to be injected 
subcutaneously, and in the case of the first, repeated. The 
argest dose that can be comfortably given at one spot is 
20 c.c. Intravenous injection is said to give better results 
than subcutaneous injection. The serum is warmed to 
the body temperature and slowly introduced into an 
arm vein, 10 to 20 c.c. every few hours. Intracerebral 
injection has also been practised, but with no better 
results. Prophylactic doses (10 c.c.) are advised as a 
routine practice in ragged, bruised, and punctured wounds, 
especially if soiled with material likely to contain tetanus 
spores. The dose is given without unnecessary delay. 
In U.S.A., in 1903, out of 4449 Fourth of July accidents, 
406 were followed by death from tetanus, while in 1907, 
only 62 tetanus deaths arose from 4413 accidents, and 
much of the decrease is attributed to the early use of a 



316 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

prophylactic dose of antitoxic serum. In veterinary 
practice, prophylaxis has been used with great success. 
Search for B. Tetani in a Suspicious Wound. 

(a) Microscopic examination of films for drumstick 

shapes. 

(b) Cultivation in deep stabs in glucose media for 
forty-eight hours. 

(c) Inoculation into mice and guinea-pigs. 

A loopful of the discharge into the root of the tail of a 
mouse will soon give rise to characteristic symptoms if 
B. tetani be present. From cultures Kitasato uses splinters 
of wood dipped in same, then heated to 80 C. for I hour, 
which kills all non-sporing organisms and destroys any 
toxin developed. A splinter is introduced subcutaneously, 
and if death results it is from the spores which it carries. 

Bacillus Botulinus. Found in "meat-poisoning" 
by raw ham by van Ermengem in 1896. The symptoms 
of the illness resembled those following sausage (botulus) 
poisoning, frequently met with in Germany from the 
ingestion of raw sausage. The symptoms follow at the 
earliest in twelve to twenty-four hours after the eating 
of the food. They are due to the action of a soluble toxin 
on the medullary centres, causing dysphagia, salivation, 
dilated pupils, and respiratory and cardiac distress. Fever 
is usually absent and consciousness is retained. 

B. botulinus is a large bacillus 4 to 9 micra long x 0-9 to 
1-2 micron thick, with rounded ends. It is slightly motile, 
and has four to eight peritrichal flagella. It forms oval 
spores at one end, rather thicker than the bacilli, and these 
show slight resistance (i hour at 80 C.). Strict anaerobe ; 
liquefies gelatin ; Gram-positive. 

Cultures. Characteristic growth on glucose-gelatin 
plates : round, yellowish, transparent colonies, composed 
of coarse granules which (under a low power) show a 
streaming movement, especially at the periphery. Forms 
gas in glucose, but not in lactose nor sucrose. Milk is not 
coagulated. All cultures have a sour odour. The toxin is 
closely related in its action to the toxins of diphtheria and 
tetanus. The bacilli do not seem to multiply in the body, 
but the toxin is absorbed from the alimentary canal and 
produces the symptoms. The infected ham or sausage 



SPORIXG BACILLI 317 

shows the bacilli in large numbers between the fibres. 
Thorough cooking destroys the toxin (not so in Gaertner 
meat-poisoning). The meat may be without any signs 
of ordinary decomposition. An antitoxin has been 
produced by Kempner, who also cultivated the bacillus 
from the intestine of the pig. Botulism is a dangerous 
affection, ending fatally in 25 per cent of those attacked. 

Bacillus of Malignant CEdema. Discovered by 
Pasteur in 1877, in guinea-pigs inoculated with putrefying 
animal tissues. Gaffky found it in the upper layers of 
the soil of gardens and in dust. It is widely distributed in 
nature, and has been found in the intestine of animals and 
man. Its spores are very resistant, and are placed in 
the centre or near it. They are oval-shaped and slightly 
bulge the bacterial body. Spore formation occurs above 
20 C. and is usually well seen in forty-eight hours at 37 C. 
The guinea-pig, rabbit, sheep, and goat are susceptible to 
inoculation ; the ox is immune to experimental infection, 
but has contracted the disease by natural channels. The 
bacillus is long (4 to 9 micra) and rather thinner than the 
anthrax bacillus, being 0-9 to 1-2 micron thick. The bacilli 
have somewhat rounded ends, and at times form threads. 
They are motile, have numerous peritrichal flagella, and 
are strict anaerobes. They stain readily by the usual 
aniline dyes ; they are Gram-negative. 

Cultures. They grow best in the presence of glucose, 
and produce a heavy, putrid odour. They liquefy gelatin, 
and in deep stab show bubbles of gas around the colonies. 
They grow rapidly in deep stab in glucose agar, and here 
also gas forms and usually splits the medium. In broth, 
there is general clouding but no pellicle ; a granular 
sediment forms. In milk, slow coagulation is produced. 
On blood serum, growth is luxuriant. On potato, growth 
readily occurs. 

Inoculation of a guinea-pig (subcutaneously) produces 
death in twenty-four to forty-eight hours. There is an 
intense inflammatory oedema around the site of puncture 
and injection, which gradually extends to the surrounding 
tissues. The skin and subcutaneous tissues are infiltrated 
with a reddish-brow r n fluid, are softened, contain bubbles 
of gas, and are in places gangrenous. The superficial 



318 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

muscles are also involved, and have a putrid odour. The 
internal organs are congested and show parenchymatous 
degeneration. The spleen is soft, but not much enlarged. 
Immediately after death bacilli are not found in the blood 
or internal organs ; but thereafter the bacilli rapidly 
spread into the blood and organs. This account applies 
to the mixed infections (garden soil) ; in pure infection, 
little gas and odour are formed. 

Toxins. A small amount of soluble toxin is formed, and 
nitrates of cultures in fluid media produce the same sym- 
ptoms (if used insufficient quantity) as the bacilli themselves. 
Chamberland and Roux, in 1887, produced immunity in 
guinea-pigs by the injection of the toxin, obtained by 
filtration or by sterilization of cultures by heat, or by filtra- 
tion from the serum of animals dead of the disease. 

Pasteur called the disease " septicemie," but it is not 
a true septicaemia like anthrax, in which the bacilli invade 
the blood and organs. It is a rare disease, occurring in 
man after traumatism. 

Quarter-Evil. A disease of cattle, sheep, and goats, 
called by the Germans, " Rauschbrand," and by the 
French, " charbon symptomatique." It has never been 
observed in man. Infection takes place by some wound 
of the surface, and occasions inflammatory swelling with 
bloody oedema and emphysema of the tissues ; the affected 
part becomes greatly swollen, and of a dark, almost black 
colour. The bacillus is found in the inflamed tissues and 
in small numbers in the blood of internal organs. It 
closely resembles the B. cedematis maligni, but is somewhat 
thicker and does not form such long threads (filaments). 
The spores also are more bulging and nearer the end of the 
bacilli. An acute disease of sheep in Northern Europe, 
called " braxy," is associated with the presence of a very 
similar, if not identical anaerobe. Active and passive 
immunization of sheep and goats and cattle are practised. 

B. Enteritidis Sporogenes was first isolated by Klein 
in 1895 from diarrhceal stools. It was afterwards found in 
infantile diarrhoea and summer diarrhoea, and as a constant 
inhabitant of sewage. It is slightly motile, with a tuft 
of flagella at one pole (lophotrichal), 1-6 to 4-8 micra long 
by 0-8 micron thick ; easily stained ; Gram-positive ; gelatin- 



SPORING BACILLI 319 

liquefying, and produces acid and gas in bile-salt glucose 
media and in peptone water -f glucose or mannite. It 
forms a spore nearer one end. Its growth in milk is highly 
characteristic, and this medium is commonly used for its 
isolation. 

METHOD. A small quantity of the suspected material 
is inoculated into sterile milk (" whole milk "), using at 
least 15 c.c. of the medium. Heat for 10 minutes at 80 C. 
to destroy all non-sporing forms, cool the tube, and incubate 
anaerobically for twenty-four to thirty-six hours. If the 
casein is precipitated and torn into irregular masses, with 
a moderately clear whey and abundant gas formation, 
the result is positive, but it is desirable to verify by animal 
inoculation. (In the examination of water and milk, the 
result is observed after two days' incubation.) The 
culture has a smell of butyric acid, and numerous bacilli 
are found in the whey. If i c.c. of the whey be injected 
into a guinea-pig, the animal becomes ill in a few hours, and 
dies in twenty-four hours. At the point of inoculation the 
skin, subcutaneous tissues, and sometimes the adjacent 
muscles, are green, gangrenous, ill-smelling, and cedema- 
tous ; there may be gas formation. This pathogenic test 
serves to distinguish the B. enteritidis sporogenes from 
the B. butyricus of Botkin, which otherwise closely 
resembles it. 

B. Aerogenes Capsulatus. First observed by Welch 
in 1891, and obtained from the intravascular blood in a 
case of ruptured aortic aneurysm. The post-mortem took 
place six hours after death, and attention was called to 
the blood by the presence of gas-bubbles throughout the 
vessels. It was fully described by Welch and Nuttall in 
1892, and in 1893 Fraenkel independently described (under 
the name of B. phlegmonis emphysematosae) a bacillus, 
now considered to be identical with the B. aerogenes 
capsulatus. Klein's B. enteritidis sporogenes is believed 
by some to be the same organism, or a closely related one. 
B. aerogenes capsulatus is widely distributed in nature, 
being found in soil, dust, brackish water, and in the 
normal intestinal tract of man and animals. In size 
it is not unlike anthrax bacillus, but is more variable in 
length and somewhat thicker. The bacilli are generally 



320 



PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 



single or in short chains, and are shorter and thicker in 
cultures. Chain formation seems to occur in the blood 
chiefly, and never in artificial culture. Welch regards this 
as an important distinction from anthrax bacilli. When 
recovered from the body fluids it possesses a capsule. Each 
bacillus forms one spore, which may be central or excentric. 
Anaerobic ; non-motile ; non-flagellar ; Gram-positive ; 
gelatin-liquefying (in most), and forming acid and gas in 
glucose, lactose, and saccharose, but not in mannite. In 
milk the reaction is similar to that described under B. 
enteritidis sporogenes. It is highly pathogenic to guinea- 
pigs but not to rabbits. 

Isolation. Make a suspension of the suspected material 
(faeces, etc.) in sterile salt solution (i c.c. in 5 c.c.). 
Thoroughly emulsify and filter through a sterile paper, 
and inject i to 2 c.c. of the filtered suspension into the ear 
vein of a rabbit. After 5 minutes, kill the rabbit and 
place its dead body in the incubator (37 C.) for 5 or 6 hours. 
At the end of this time the animal is usually found tensely 
distended with gas, and post mortem gas bubbles will be 
found throughout the body, most characteristically in the 
liver, where isolated bubbles are found on the surface. 
From the bubbles, smears and cultures may be taken. 
Identification is made from its morphology, capsule, non- 
motility, and gas formation. In man, infection usually 
follows traumatism. Distinction from B. enteritidis 
sporogenes : non-motility, non-flagellar, not fermenting 
mannite. Muir and Ritchie state that it is non-gelatin- 
liquefying and non-pathogenic to guinea-pigs, but American 
authors describe it as above.

CHAPTER XV. 
SPIRILLA. 

SPIRILLUM CHOLERA ASIATICS. 

THE cholera spirillum was discovered by Koch in 1883 in 
the defaecations of sufferers from cholera. It is also called 
the " comma bacillus " and the " Vibrio cholerae." 

Description. Short, slightly curved rods, 1-5 to 2 micra 
long by 0-5 micron thick. Ex. ( In pairs, may form an 
S-shape, thus <,. Actively motile, and swim like fish in 
lines, thus E E E E- Possess one flagellum, situated at one" 
end (monotrichal). Non-sporing ; not phosphorescent ; 
Gram-negative. Markedly aerobic, but can grow anaero- 
bically. Optimum temperature 37 C. ; growth usually 
ceases at 16 C. Gelatin-liquefying. Give nitroso-indol 
reaction with sulphuric acid within twenty-four hours. 

Culture. Grows readily on all usual media, but better if 
alkaline, and except on potato even at room temperature ; 
characteristic on gelatin plates and in broth. On gelatin 
plate : minute whitish points in twenty-four to forty-eight 
hours ; surface when magnified is coarsely granular and 
furrowed. Liquefaction follows and the colony sinks, 
showing a ring around. In gelatin stab: liquefaction 
begins at the surface, with gradual formation of a funnel 
of liquefaction. In broth: rapid clouding occurs with 
wrinkled pellicle on top, composed of spirilla in a very 
actively motile condition. In milk : growth but no visible 
change. In peptone water : rapid growth with production 
of indol, and reduction of nitrate to nitrite, hence a few 
drops of pure sulphuric acid will give a red colour the 
so-called cholera-red reaction. Also given in broth culture, 
and in both in twenty-four hours, owing to rapid growth. 
Not absolutely specific, as it is given also by Sp. Metch- 
nikovi. Blood serum is rapidly liquefied. In sugar media : 
no gas is formed, but acid with glucose. Does not pro- 
duce haemolysis, though very similar species do. Does not 
multiply in water.

322 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Staining. Readily with usual stains, best with Loeffler's 
methylene-blue and weak carbol-fuchsin. Loses stain by 
Gram's method. 

Resistance. Not great. Killed in ten minutes at 60 C. ; 
on drying, in two hours. Mineral acids, i in 5000 to I in 
10,000, destroy it in a few minutes. The gastric juice con- 
tains 2 parts of HC1 per 1000 ; hence it is killed by gastric 
juice, but can flourish in intestine. Freezing kills it in 
three to four days. 

Agglutination Is shown by serum of cholera con- 
valescents in dilutions of 1-15 to 1-120. Present eight to 
ten days after attack, most marked twenty-eight days 
after, and gradually diminishes. Has been noted as early 
as first day of disease. 

Pathogenesis. For man : has been established by 
laboratory accidents. Does not invade blood ; immense 
numbers in stools ; in rice-water stools, loosened epithelial 
cells loaded with vibrios. Not in urine. Infection by 
mouth. Disappears from stools in two to three days. 
Cholera carriers : healthy persons whose faeces contain 
virulent cholera spirilla. Mostly spread by water, fomites, 
fingers, flies. For animals : not established, though vibrios 
on teats of suckling mother have infected young, with 
choleraic symptoms. But as this result or similar ones have 
been given by other vibrios, specificity cannot be founded 
on this test. Intraperitoneal injection in guinea-pigs is 
followed by general symptoms, with abdominal distension, 
subnormal temperature, and profound collapse. There is 
peritoneal effusion which may be almost clear, or with 
flakes of lymph. There is little tendency to invade the 
blood-stream, and the symptoms are mainly due to an 
intoxication. It is not pathogenic to pigeons. 

Toxins. Filtered cholera cultures have as a rule little 
toxic action ; hence it is inferred that little soluble toxin 
is formed, but mostly endotoxin. Results at present are 
conflicting. 

Pfeiffer's Reaction. If cholera spirilla are injected into 
the peritoneum of an immunized guinea-pig, they first 
lose their motility, then swell up and crumble into frag- 
ments, which finally melt away and disappear. This 
lysis is also manifested in a test tube in a mixture of serum 



SPIRILLA 323 

plus vibrios. Or, inject a mixture of one loopful (2 mgr. 
of recent agar culture and I c.c. of broth containing o-ooi 
c.c. of anti-cholera serum into the peritoneum of a guinea- 
pig. Remove some fluid at regular intervals and examine. 
If above reaction is got, then said to be positive, and in case 
described, organism is proved to be true cholera spirillum. 
If the latter is used against an unknown serum, then the 
anti-power of the serum can be determined and, if positive, 
by using various dilutions, the bacteriolytic power. 

Immunization. A guinea-pig is easily immunized by 
repeated injections of non-fatal doses of dead spirilla ; 
later small doses of living organisms may be used. A high 
degree of immunity is thus developed, and the blood 
serum of such an animal (anti-cholera serum) when 
injected into another guinea-pig has marked protective 
power. This is not due to any antitoxic substances, but 
to antibacterial power. Cholera-immune serum is thus 
bacteriolytic, not antitoxic. This power is specific, and 
does not apply to other closely related organisms. 

Haffkine's Vaccine. First vaccine : Attenuated virus 
by long cultivation at 39 C. or by other methods. 
Second vaccine : Given five days later, of virulent virus 
(by passage through guinea-pigs). Both given sub- 
cutaneously. Lately has given only one, and that the 
" virus exalte." General conclusions as to efficacy : 
(i) Protective effect of anti-cholera vaccine commences 
soon after operation and increases rapidly for first four 
days, and lasts fourteen months, after which it diminishes 
and completely disappears. Larger doses cause longer 
effects. (2) During period of its activity, the number of 
cases among vaccinated is one-tenth of number among 
others. (3) Mortality among those attacked differs but 
little, and the course of the disease is not affected by 
the previous inoculation. 

Isolation. 

i. From Faces. Make pre-culture in peptone water. 
(a) Inoculate peptone water inErlenmeyer flasks (i loopful 
in each), (b) In eight hours, if a film appears or not, 
make hanging drop from surface, and if you get fish trains, 
dry and stain to see if form is typical, (c) Subculture 
from film on gelatin plates, and smear over agar plates. 



324 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

(d) After eight to ten hours examine any colonies, and if 
pure cultures, plant out as follows : (i) Peptone and salt 
solution : in twenty-four hours at 37 C, turbid, and gives 
cholera-red ; (ii) Gelatin plates : characteristic colonies 
with irregular margins ; (iii) Gelatin stab : typical funnel- 
shaped liquefaction ; (iv) Agar slope : growth in twenty- 
four hours at 37 C. must give with anti-cholera serum, 
agglutination and Pfeiffer's test ; (v) A portion of colony 
should be examined for typical microscopical appearances. 

Make films and hanging drops direct from stools. 
Dunbar diagnoses from two hanging drops, one having 
added to it an equal quantity of 1-50 normal serum, the 
other an equal quantity of 1-500 anti-cholera serum. 
Cholera organisms retain their motility in the first instance, 
but lose it and agglutinate in the second. The hanging 
drop is mounted from peptone water in which a piece of 
mucus has been broken up. 

2. From Water. Keep 10 per cent peptone water 
sterilized. Take 900 c.c. of suspected water, and add 
100 c.c. of strong peptone water. Divide into ten flasks, 
each containing 100 c.c. Incubate at 37 C. In eight to 
twelve hours make a film and hanging-drop preparation 
from the surface of each flask. From those flasks showing 
most similar forms, make subcultures, proceeding as 
above. If a spirillum conforms to all the above tests, it is 
probably the true cholera vibrio, but it must be remem- 
bered that a certain number of spirilla, although agglutina- 
ting to some extent with cholera serum, are sharply 
differentiated by being multiciliated and heemolytic. 



SPIRILLA OTHER THAN THE 

CHOLERA SPIRILLUM. 
(Often present in water but not necessarily pathogenic). 

Sp. Metchnikovi Is found in a disease resembling fowl 
cholera in the faces and blood. It is practically identical 
with the Sp. cholerae, having a single polar flagellum. 
CulturaDy, it fluidifies gelatin twice as rapidly, and grows 
slightly more luxuriantly. It is sharply distinguished, 
however, by being very pathogenic to pigeons (doves), 



SPIRILLA 325 

whereas Sp. cholerae is scarcely so. It is negative to 
Pfeiffer's test, but gives the cholera-red reaction. 

Sp. Massaua (Massowah) Was isolated in a small 
epidemic of cholera and accepted as the true spirillum, 
but further study showed that it was negative to Pfeiffer, 
was very pathogenic to pigeons, and possessed four flagella. 

Sp. of Finkler and Prior Was isolated first from 
faeces of a case of cholera nostras, and has since been found 
in water. Morphologically, it is like the Sp. cholerae, 
though thicker in the centre and more pointed at the ends. 
It does not give the cholera-red reaction, and liquefies 
gelatin very rapidly, showing no bubble-like appearance. 
Grows w r ell on potato, and is negative to Pfeiffer. 

Sp. Aquatilis of Gunther Was found in Spree water, 
and closely resembles Sp. cholerae, but young colonies 
have a smooth rim, and it does not give cholera-red 
reaction, and is negative to Pfeiffer. Does not grow on 
potato. 

Sp. Danubicus. Cultivated from canal water. Does 
not give Pfeiffer, and colonies are different ; otherwise it 
closely resembles the cholera spirillum. 

Sp. Deneke Also called Sp. tyrogenum, was isolated 
from butter and old cheese. It closely resembles the Sp. 
cholerae, but is thinner and smaller; growth in gelatin 
similar but more rapid, and does not give the cholera-red 
reaction. It is very feebly pathogenic, and is usually 
regarded as a harmless saprophyte. 

Sp. Phosphorescens Gives luminous cultures. 



CHAPTER XVI. 

SPIROCH^TES. 

THE diseases produced by spirochaetes are now referred 
to as spirilloses or spirochaetoses, and fall into (following 
Muir and Ritchie) two main groups : (i) The human 
spirillar fevers, and the corresponding affections of various 
animals ; (2) Syphilis and yaws, and the ulcerative and 
gangrenous conditions apparently caused by spirochaetes 
(e.g., Vincent's angina). In the first group, blood infec- 
tion is the rule, and the organisms are, in most cases if 
not in all, transmitted by blood-sucking ecto-parasites. 
In the second group, the organisms are primarily tissue 
parasites, and later show blood infection, and are mainly 
spread by direct contact. As regards general morphology, 
staining reactions, and conditions of growth and culture, 
the various spirochaetes present common characters, and 
their classification with bacteria or protozoa is still a 
matter of doubt. 

Spirillum Obermeieri or Sp. of relapsing fever (Ober- 
meyer, 1873) Is now usually regarded as a spirochaete, and 
known as the Spirochaeta recurrentis. It is found in the 
blood of patients suffering from " relapsing fever " from 
shortly before the onset of the pyrexia until shortly before 
the crisis, and similarly in the relapses. The relationship 
of the organism to the disease has been proved by the 
injection of spirochaetes into the blood-stream causing 
the typical attack, both in the human subject and in 
monkeys ; also in white mice and rats, but in these and 
in monkeys, relapse is rare. Sp. Obermeieri is a delicate 
spiral thread, 7 to 9 micra long by about i micron thick, 
but the size varies from one-half to nine times the diameter 
of a red blood corpuscle (7 micra). The windings like- 
wise vary from 4 to 10 or more. It stains with watery 
basic aniline dyes, somewhat faintly, but best with the 
Romanowsky stains. It shows a homogeneous cell body 



SPIROCH^TES 327 

or a few granules, but no division into segments. It is 
Gram-negative. Flagella have been noted. 

Spirochaeta Vincenti Is a delicate spiral-shaped 
organism, said to be often found in the mouth as a simple 
saprophyte. It was described by Vincent in 1896, in an 
inflammatory lesion of the pharynx, since spoken of as 
Vincent's angina, in association with a fusiform bacillus 
of large size (3 to 10 micra by 0-5 to 0-8 micron). The 
curvature of the spirochaetes is irregular and the number 
of curves variable. The relationship of these organisms to 
the disease is still obscure. 



THE MICRO-ORGANISM OF SYPHILIS. 

This is variously called the Spirochaeta pallida of 
Schaudinn and Hoffmann, the Treponema pallidum, and 
the Microspironema pallidum. It was discovered by the 
two observers named in 1905, in the primary sore and 
in the adjacent lymphatic glands. It has since been 
demonstrated in numerous lesions and in the blood, and 
in congenital syphilis. It has been found in large 
numbers and in pure culture in the lungs, liver, spleen, 
pancreas, and kidneys ; and in a few cases in the heart 
muscle. It has also been found in the roseolar spots in 
the disease, and in blister fluid in an infected person. 
This shows how the disease can be spread (as at times 
it has been) by vaccine fluid. 

In the bubo, other spirochaetes are usually found in 
association with the Spirochaeta pallida. These are 
much thicker, less undulated, more refractile, and more 
deeply staining. They are spoken of as Spirochaeta 
refringens. These are said to have an undulating membrane 
(like the trypanosomes) but no flagella. The term 
treponema is now reserved for a genus with no undulating 
membrane, and flagella of some sort at their extremities. 
To this group the organism of syphilis belongs, and is 
hence now referred to more strictly as the Treponema 
pallidum. 

The Treponema pallidum is an extremely delicate 
spiral organism, very slender, about 6 to 14 micra long by 
less than 0-5 micron thick, showing about a dozen very 



328 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

regular spiral turns close together, the whole resembling 
a fine corkscrew. It has a flagellum at each extremity, 
but no undulating membrane. It multiplies by longi- 
tudinal division, the initial stage being shown by the 
splitting of the flagellum at one end. It can be demon- 
strated in the living state in a hanging drop, or a ringed-in 
cover-slip, cutting down the light to a minimum, or better, 
by using dark-field illumination. In smears, it can be 
stained by Giemsa's method, of which there are several 
modifications. -A more rapid and simple method is by 
using India ink. A loopful of secretion from a chancre is 
mixed with a loopful of ink (Gunther & Wagner's liquid 
pearl ink), and the mixture made into a smear as for blood. 
Dry in the air, and examine with an oil-immersion lens. 
The treponemata appear as white spirals on a dark back- 
ground. In tissues, ordinary methods do not stain the 
organisms. Levaditi's method is commonly used, and 
consists in fixing in formalin for 24 hours, washing out the 
formalin with water, the traces of which, which might con- 
tain formalin, being removed with alcohol ; soak in silver 
nitrate solution for from three to five days, wash and soak 
in pyrogallol-formalin solution ; wash, dehydrate, imbed in 
paraffin, and section. A shorter method has been devised. 
The evidence of its pathogenicity is derived from its 
constant presence in the lesions of acquired and congenital 
syphilis, and in that it has been communicated to monkeys, 
producing typical syphilitic course and lesions, from which 
the treponema was recovered in 70 per cent of the cases 
examined. It has not yet been successfully cultivated in 
a pure state, or in that case complement fixation by a 
pure culture might be an additional proof. It is not 
regularly recovered from tertiary lesions, which is not 
surprising. This is analogous to tuberculosis, in which 
the tubercle bacillus is often not demonstrable by ordinary 
methods in the chronic lesions. Treponema pallidum 
does not pass through a filter. 

Wassermann Reaction Is now regularly used in clinical 
diagnosis. It is described on page 205 ; its value is 
discussed on page 209. In a recent research by Calmette, 
Breton, and Couvrer, it has been practically applied 
to the diagnosis of syphilis in the newly born child, 



SPIROCH^ETES 329 

with a view to securing early treatment in those cases 
which would not be diagnosed on ordinary clinical 
grounds. The mode of procedure was to examine the 
placental blood taken at the time of delivery, before 
ligature of the cord. Out of 103 such samples, in 16 a 
positive result was obtained. Out of the 16, no evidence 
was got of syphilis by clinical examination or history in 
the parents or child in 8 cases. Of the remaining 8, there 
was definite evidence in the parents or child in 5 cases ; 
and in one other the mother had previously borne an 
anencephalic monster. In every case in which the child 
showed signs of syphilis at birth, the mother's blood gave 
a positive reaction. 

Immunization. Though one attack of syphilis usually 
protects against another infection beginning with a chancre, 
no success has yet been obtained in attempts to produce 
either active or passive immunization. 

Yaws. A disease resembling syphilis, and at times 
regarded as identical with it, which prevails endemically in 
the West Indies, Brazil, Fiji, Ceylon, the East Indies, and 
different parts of Africa. It is called variously yaws, fram- 
bcesia, bubas, koko, paranghi, and pian. It is highly con- 
tagious, but is not hereditary or congenital. It is now 
believed to be due to Treponema pertenue, first described by 
Castellani in 1905 as Spirochaeta pertenuis, which resembles 
the Treponema pallidum closely. 



CHAPTER XVII. 

YEASTS AND MOULDS. 

YEASTS and moulds are grouped in the class of fungi to 
which the bacteria also belong. They are distinguished 
from the latter (and from one another) by their mode of 
reproduction. From the bacteria they also differ in being 
much larger, as a rule. Their biological requirements 
are also, generally, much less exacting. 

Between these groups and the average bacterium, the 
space is bridged by some forms called the higher bacteria, 
which resemble the moulds* in showing branching. Such 
are actinomyces (which has been considered immediately 
after B. tuberculosis), the streptothricae, etc. These are 
often grouped as trichomycetes, which is regarded as a 
subdivision of the true moulds. The whole subject is at 
present uncertain and confused. Foulerton, in his Milroy 
Lectures (Lancet, 1910, Vol. i., p. 551 on) urges the view 
that the micro-organisms variously called tubercle bacilli, 
actinomyces, cladothrix nocardia, oospora, and strepto- 
thrix, belong to one family of moulds or hyphomycetes. 

In clinical medicine and pathology the term " mycoses " 
is used (following Virchow) to denote all the affections 
produced by filamentous and budding fungi, and this term 
associated with the seat of the lesion has given rise to such 
terms as dermatomycosis, otomycosis, etc. On the other 
hand, such terms as actinomycosis, saccharomycosis, 
blastomycosis, aspergillosis, sporotrichosis, etc., are used. 

All the members of these groups may be considered as 
facultative parasites, parasitic life being unnecessary to 
their cycle of evolution, as their proper existence is a 
saprophytic one. The parasitism is, in their case, simply 
a phenomenon of adaptation. 

Being destitute of chlorophyll, they do not need light, 
and grow luxuriantly in the dark. They vary much in 
their temperature requirements, a few growing well at 



YEASTS AND MOULDS 331 

human body-heat, some at 30 to 33 C., and most at air 
temperatures. Growth at temperatures higher than the 
optimum, in certain media and anaerobically, results in the 
production of pleomorphic forms. Most of them die when 
deprived of air or oxygen ; a few are anaerobic. Moisture 
is absolutely necessary. They grow readily on organic 
matter of all kinds. The natural media commonly used 
in their study are bread, sterilized milk, beer wort, potato, 
carrot, decoctions of fruits, etc. As these media are vari- 
able in their composition from time to time, and the 
problem of pleomorphism has to be faced, artificial media 
of definite composition and reaction are preferred in 
scientific work for giving comparable results. Growth is 
best on solid media, standardized to an acid reaction of 
-f 2 per cent (+ 20 per litre). 



YEASTS. 

The yeasts are fungi characterized by the mode of 
multiplication known as " budding " or "gemmation" or 
asymmetrical fission, and are hence called blastomycetes. 
From their action in fermenting sugars they have also been 
called saccharomycetes. Their botanical position as a 
separate group is not well established, as a large number of 
intermediate forms relate them closely to the moulds. 
The usual yeast cell is round or oval in shape, 10 to 20 micra 
long by 5 to 15 micra across, and occurs singly or in short 
chains. Each cell is bounded by a cell-membrane composed 
of cellulose, and of such a thickness (0-5 micron) that it 
shows a double contour. Within the membrane is con- 
tained the protoplasm, in which is a large number of 
granules, globules, and vacuoles, and in old cultures a 
nucleus is sometimes seen. When budding, the mother cell 
throws out a small globular process, which gradually 
enlarges until it attains nearly the same size as the parent 
cell. By a gradual narrowing of the isthmus between the 
mother and daughter cells, the daughter cell finally becomes 
free. In addition to this mode of reproduction, most yeasts 
can form spores called " ascospores." This takes place 
when there is a lack of nourishment or where the conditions 
of life are otherwise unfavourable. These spores are 



332 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

formed by endogenous cell-division, and the usual rule 
is for the protoplasm of one cell to divide into four spores, 
each with its own cell-membrane, the original cell- 
membrane persisting and serving as an envelope enclosing 
the spores. 

Yeasts grow more slowly than bacteria, and are hence 
more difficult to isolate from mixed cultures on the 
ordinary media. Once isolated they are kept alive by 
subculture every 2 to 3 months. On glucose agar or plain 
agar, colonies appear in 3 to 4 days as minute glistening 
white spots. In stab, the growth is all at the top, forming 
a heaped-up creamy layer on the surface of the medium. 
In broth, a stringy gelatinous growth is formed. Growth 
takes place on gelatin, which is not liquefied. On potato, 
growth is more rapid. The cultivated yeasts used in 
brewing and baking processes are capable of fermenting 
various sugars. This action is due to certain ferments or 
enzymes elaborated by the yeasts. Two of the enzymes 
are diffused into the medium in which growth is taking 
place ; one remains closely bound to the yeast cell, and 
was only isolated by Buchner by rupturing the living 
yeast cells under great pressure, filtering, and centrifugal- 
izing the filtrate. This filtrate was found to have the 
power of fermenting glucose and laevulose into alcohol 
and carbonic acid gas. This endo-enzyme is called 
" zymase." 

C 6 H 12 O 6 = 2-C 2 H,-OH +>CO 2 

The other two soluble enzymes are " invertase " and 
" maltase." The former inverts cane sugar or saccharose 
into invert sugar (glucose + laevulose), and so renders it 
susceptible to the action of the " zymase." " Maltase " 
acts on malt sugar, changing it into glucose, which is then 
acted on by the " zymase." 

Q-2H 22 O U + H/) = C 6 H la O 6 + CgH^Ofi 
Saccharose. Glucose + laevulose. 

C 12 H M O tl + H a O = C fi H ia 6 + QH 12 6 
Maltose. Glucose -f glucose. 

Saccharomyces cerevisiae. This is the name applied 
to the yeast in common use by brewers and bakers. 



YEASTS AND MOULDS 333 

It consists of round or oval cells containing a clear fluid 
and no granules. It is not used older than one week's 
growth, after which time granules appear in the cells. 

When budding very rapidly, delicate mycelial threads 
are formed. It forms ascospores at 25 C. in thirty hours, 
and at 12 C. in ten days. In brewing, yeast is added to 
the beer wort (cooled to 16 C.), and fermentation takes 
place. A brownish-yellow scum forms on the surface, 
bubbles of gas (CO 2 ) escape, forming a foam, and alcohol 
is formed in the liquid. This is the " high " fermentation 
with " top " yeast, and takes place in several days. 

In some breweries " low " or " bottom " yeast is used, 
and the fermentation is conducted at 5 C. The yeast cells 
sink to the bottom as they are formed, and the whole 
process takes a much longer time (fourteen days). 

In baking, the yeast converts the starch into sugar, and 
then the latter into CO 2 and alcohol. The gas breaks 
up the glutin into thin-walled cells. The subsequent 
" baking" or heating kills the ferment, and drives off the 
CO 2 and alcohol. 

Wild yeasts are usually termed torulcc. They have 
oval or spherical-shaped cells, do not produce ascospores, 
and have only feeble fermentative powers. Some of them 
have been found to produce a true mycelium. 

Torula rosea (Saccharomyces rosaceus) is a pink torula, 
which, growing on gelatin, agar, etc., produces raised 
masses with a polished pink surface, similar to a piece of 
coral. Microscopically, it shows rounded or slightly oval 
cells, 5 to 8 micra in diameter, and containing a delicate 
yellow pigment, which in the mass gives the pink shade. 

Torula niger (Saccharomyces niger) grows on gelatin as a 
black heaped-up mass, resembling a piece of black sealing- 
wax. On potato and bread paste it forms a dull sooty 
crust, and in milk a black crust. It is met with in the air. 

Pathogenic yeasts have been described in connection 
with (i) Multiple abscesses in bones, lungs, spleen, and 
kidney, and ending fatally (Busse) ; (2) An illness simula- 
ting diphtheria (Klein and Gordon) ; (3) Subcutaneous 
myxomatous tumours (CurtiS) ; (4) Middle-ear disease 
(Maggiora and Gradenigo) ; (5) A lupus-like skin disease 



334 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

(Gilchrist) ; (6) An intraperitoneal tumour (Blanchard, 
Schwartz, and Binot), etc. 



MOULDS. 

The distinguishing feature of the moulds is their growth 
in long threads or filaments, with seed-bearing branches 
called hyphae. Each filament may be a single, simple, 
multinuclear cell, or a greatly branched one, or may be 
composed of a row of cells set end to end. The interlacing 
mass of threads is called the " mycelium." On this basis 
moulds are divided into two classes : (i) Phycomycetes, 
or those in which the mycelial threads consist of a single 
cell ; and (2) Mycomycetes, in which the mycelial threads 
are composed of numerous cells. The two groups also 
differ in that in the first, reproduction is sexual and asexual ; 
and in the second is by the asexual process only. All 
moulds prefer an acid to an alkaline medium, and hence 
are found attacking fruit preserves and similar substances. 
The spores of moulds are present everywhere, and in 
the air are in greater numbers than bacteria. 

The members of this group of fungi which we shall 
consider are : Mucor mucedo ; Aspergillus ; Penicillium ; 
Microsporon furfur ; M. minutissimum ; Sporotrichum 
Beurmanni ; Oidium albicans ; and the moulds of ring- 
worm. 

Mucor mucedo is the commonest mucor or " head " 
mould, and belongs to the class of single-celled fungi or 
phycomycetes. It is the common, white, cottony mould 
which grows on camp bread, rotten fruit, horse dung, etc. 
There is a finely branched mycelium from which project 
thicker unbranched hyphae. Near the end of these hyphae 
a septum forms, the terminal portion of the hypha swells, 
and in it numerous oval spores develop. The globular 
swelling produced is known as the " sporangium," and 
is enclosed by a capsule. It ruptures when ripe by the 
swelling of the gelatinous material in which the spores are 
imbedded. The end of the hypha projects into the spor- 
angium, and this part of it is called the " columella." This 
asexual form of multiplication is the more common, but 
sexual reproduction occurs under conditions not well defined. 



YEASTS AND MOULDS 335 

In this form lateral branches (gametophores) grow out 
from two hyphae close to each other. These gametophores 
meet by the tips, fuse, and then by septa the central 
portion is separated off and becomes a " zygospore." 
The mature zygospore under suitable conditions enlarges 
and sends out a germ tube or hypha, on the end of which 
a sporangium may appear. Mucor grows on gelatin plate 
as round white colonies which soon cause liquefaction. In 
gelatin stab, it forms a dense white growth spreading over 
the surface, and sending down penetrating branches sub- 
aerial hyphae ; others rise up vertically into the tube- 
aerial hyphae. Other mucors are : M. stolonifer (black 
mucor), M. spinosus (chocolate colour : has spines on the 
columella) . 

Aspergillus or "Knob" Mould. This is a common 
form of mould, occurring on bread, cheese, oranges, etc. 
There are several varieties, A. glaucus (blue mould), A. 
niger (black mould), A. flavus (yellow mould), and A. 
fumigatus (green turning to grey). The mycelial filaments 
are composed of numerous rod-like cells joined end to end. 
They reproduce asexually. Hyphae arise from the mycelial 
network, and each hypha terminates in a knob-like expan- 
sion, the columella. The surface of the columella becomes 
studded with flask-shaped organs or cells called sterig- 
mata, and each of these forms spores or conidia, which 
remain attached in chains like streptococci. The result is 
a knob with radial projections composed of spores ; but 
having, unlike Mucor, no containing capsule. 

Aspergilli grow on gelatin as round white colonies very 
like those of penicillium. In a few days coloured points 
appear, denoting spore formation, being blue in glaucus, 
black in niger, etc. The gelatin is liquefied. In gelatin 
stab there is a dense felt-like growth (more pronounced 
than with penicillium), and later liquefaction. 

The pathogenic aspergilli include : 

i. Aspergillus fumigatus, which has been found on the 
one hand in a malady simulating pulmonary tuberculosis, 
but not showing tubercle baciUi in the sputum (at times 
it is associated with the tubercle bacillus) ; and on the 
other hand, causing affections in the external auditory 
canal, the tympanic cavity, the nasal fossae, and in wounds. 



336 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Such infections mostly occur in those engaged in handling 
grain, whole or crushed, either as transporters or as 
feeders of animals or fowls. Many of the cases are among 
bird fanciers, especially those keeping pigeons, which 
among birds are specially liable to aspergillosis. Birds 
and mammals can be fatally infected by intravenous 
inoculation with aspergillus spores. In birds, infection 
has been produced by inhalation of spores. In examining 
sputum for the presence of aspergilli, it is absolutely 
necessary that the examination should be made immedi- 
ately after expectoration, since the spores of such moulds 
may exist in the air in considerable numbers, and falling 
on to the sputum would germinate there. A film is 
made on a slide in the ordinary way, dried, fixed by heat 
or absolute alcohol, stained with carbol-thionin, and 
examined. The characteristic threads or filaments of 
the mycelium are seen among the pus cells. It is further 
necessary to verify the diagnosis by cultivating the fungus 
and noting its growth and morphology. This should be 
done on a special medium, such as Raulin's liquid medium, 
in which the aspergillus grows well. This is composed 
of water, 1500 grm. ; crystallized sugar, 70 grm. ; 
tartaric acid and ammonium nitrate, of each 4 grm. ; 
ammonium phosphate and potassium carbonate, 0-6 grm. ; 
magnesium carbonate, 0-4 grm. ; ammonium sulphate, 
0-25 grm. ; sulphate of iron, sulphate of zinc, potassium 
silicate, and manganese carbonate, of each 0-07 grm. 
Take a sufficiency in an Erlenmeyer flask, inoculate by 
dropping in a small piece of the sputum, and incubate at 
37 C. In 3 to 10 days there grows a whitish meshwork, 
with branches bearing spores, green at first, but in a few 
days becoming smoke-black. The growth is examined 
microscopically, and its characters are studied. To verify 
its pathogenic action, an emulsion of the culture is injected 
into the ear- vein of a rabbit. The animal dies in several 
days with a generalized pseudo-tuberculosis.

producing a false membrane.

Penicillium, or " Pencil " Mould. The blue-green 

variety of this form of mould, Penicillium glaucum, is the 



YEASTS AND MOULDS 337 

most commonly occurring of all moulds. In this genus, 
the mycelial threads are septate or many-celled. Hyphae 
are given off, and from the end of each hypha, two or 
more short pencil-like branches arise, and these likewise 
give origin to other similar branches. These last, or 
further set of branches, produce spores or conidia, which, 
remaining attached, form a string of spores. The branches 
producing the spores are called sterigmata, and the inter- 
mediate branches the basidia or conidiophores. The 
result is not unlike an #-ray photograph of the arm, in 
which the humerus represents the hypha, the radius and 
ulna two basidia (omit the wrist), the metacarpus five 
sterigmata (say three from the radius and two from the 
ulna), each sterigma bearing spores the phalanges. The 
spores are rounded in shape. Penicillium glaucum grows 
on bread paste, showing at first a white fluffy growth, 
becoming either green or blue, as the spores form. It 
sometimes is covered with little drops of dew-like fluid. 

On gelatin plates it grows as small round colonies of 
hair-like filaments, at first white in colour, but later 
greenish. The gelatin is liquefied. In gelatin stab a 
white fluffy layer or scum rapidly forms on the top, and 
descending branches run into the gelatin, as well as hori- 
zontal ones from the stab. The medium becomes bluish 
or greenish, and liquefaction takes place. Growths on 
agar and potato have similar characters. 

Penicillia have been described as the cause of chronic 
catarrh of the Eustachian tube, and of gastric hyper- 
acidity. 

Microsporon furfur Is a mould first described in 1846, 
and found in the skin affection called pityriasis versicolor. 
It is composed of sinuous hyphae, 3 micra in thickness, 
showing right-angle branches. The spores are large, 
3 to 5 micra in diameter," and are formed in a manner 
similar to that in penicillium. 

Pityriasis versicolor is seen in persons subject to profuse 
perspiration, who have been infected with the spores from 
the air or elsewhere. The fungus grows in the superficial 
layers of the epidermis, forming a yellowish or coffee- 
and-milk coloured patch, usually seen on the chest or 
abdomen or back. Little or no discomfort is caused to 

22 



338 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

the person affected. The diagnosis is easily confirmed 
by examining a scale in a drop of liquor potassae ; or the 
scale may be teased out on a slide in a drop of absolute 
alcohol, and then stained with eosin. The filaments 
and the large round spores are readily seen. 

Microsporon minutissimum is a mould described as 
the cause of dhobie's itch or erythrasma, which is a common 
affection in the tropics. It is mainly seen in the axillae, 
the scrotal region, the insides of the thighs, and the 
submammary folds. Like the Microsporon furfur, it 
lives a simple saprophytic existence in the epidermis, 
causing reddish-brown patches with an abrupt edge. 
When a scale is removed, washed with ether, teased out 
in acetic acid, allowed to dry, washed with alcohol, and 
stained with carbol-thionin, the fungi can be seen with 
the microscope as slender sinuous filaments, formed of 
short elements, very similar to bacilli, from destruction 
of parts of the filaments, or non-staining of these parts. 

Sporotrichum Beurmanni is a mould composed of a 
mycelium, the filaments of which branch in all directions. 
The hyphae are i to 2 micra thick, and at the ends of these 
oval spores are formed (3 to 5 micra by 1-5 to 3), singly or 
in grape-like clusters. Spores are also formed around the 
main filaments, or apparently so. The full life-cycle of the 
sporotrichon has not yet been worked out, and its exact 
classification is still a matter of doubt. It was first isolated 
by Schenk in 1898 from refractory subcutaneous abscesses 
in man. De Beurmann and Ramond rediscovered it in 
granulomata in the skin in 1903. Since then numerous 
cases have been reported in France, and lately two cases 
have been reported in this country (Ofenhein, Lancet, 
1911, Vol. i, page 659 ; and Norman Walker and James 
Ritchie, British Medical Journal, 1911, Vol. 2, pages 1-5. 
The latter article is accompanied by a special coloured 
plate and a short bibliography). 

Sporotrichosis is a disease characterized by cutaneous 
and subcutaneous tumours, firm and indolent. These may 
ulcerate and discharge a viscid homogeneous pus of a 
yellowish-grey colour. The tumours have been in the past 
mistaken for those due to syphilis and tuberculosis, and pot- 
assium iodide and tuberculin injections or other treatment 



YEASTS AND MOULDS 339 

administered. When iodide was given, cure was often 
effected, and so the diagnosis was apparently confirmed. 
The ulcers have similarly been treated as syphilitic, as 
lupus, and as simple pyogenic ulcers. In many cases 
there is a history of a minor injury, with a spread from 
this up the line of the lymphatics, with tumour formation 
and breaking down at various points en route. The 
lymphatic glands are not usually enlarged, the fungus 
probably not reaching them at an early stage. The 
affection is usually not a serious one, but there is little 
tendency towards cure if left untreated. Stimulating 
local treatment, together with the administration of large 
doses of potassium iodide (60 to 80 grains, or 4 to 5 grm. 
daily) is quickly followed by cure. The diagnosis is based 
on the direct examinations of scrapings, which are usually 
negative except for spores, oval and 3 to 5 micra long ; 
and by cultivation. Pus from an unbroken abscess (if 
possible) is inoculated freely, since the parasitic elements 
are scarce, on broth, glycerin agar, potato, carrot, etc., 
on all of which it grows well. Growth becomes visible 
in some days, and gradually increases. On agar, the 
colonies are first white and cream, and later a dirty grey. 
On carrot, the colour is first yellow, then grey, and finally 
quite black. On potato, small, white, woolly spots 
appear, increase in size, and change to a brownish colour. 
Further growth results in heaped-up masses likened to 
cerebral convolutions. " In gelatin stab, an inverted 
fir-tree growth is got, but no liquefaction. It forms acid 
specially with inulin in peptone solution, and also with 
glucose, maltose, galactose, raffinose, saccharose, and 
mannite ; but with lactose, dulcite, inosite, adonite, 
sorbite, and salicin, the medium remains alkaline. In 
no case was there any gas formation. No indol formation 
was observed. The organism was definitely aerobic " 
(Ritchie, loc. cit.}. This observer has also studied the 
organism in hanging-drop agar cultures, and found that 
the mycelium formation is readily noted at 22 C., but at 
37 C. few filaments are formed ; instead, large spores 
(5 micra) from which short stalks sprouted, each bearing a 
spore, which thus formed a circle round the central body. 
The latter soon degenerated. This suggests the reason 



340 

why filaments are not usually found in the pus or granulo- 
mata. The optimum temperature therefore is about 
20 C. (15 to 22). The organism is Gram-positive, but 
not acid-fast. 

Outside the human body, the organism has been found 
living on decaying vegetable matter. Sporotrichosis has 
also been described as occurring in dogs, rats, and in the 
horse. In the last it causes a lymphangitis with superficial 
granulomata of a benign nature, but important from 
having a resemblance to glanders, especially as it also 
at times prevails as an epizootic. Human infection from 
the horse has been reported in twelve instances in seven or 
eight years in North Dakota, U.S.A., where sporotrichosis 
in horses occurs moderately frequently. A case is also 
reported in a female bitten on both thumbs while holding 
a rat which had been inoculated with sporotrichosis. 
Serum agglutination and complement fixation have been 
found to occur in sporotrichosis, but are not specific, as 
the serum of patients suffering from other mycotic 
affections (thrush, actinomycosis) reacts to Sporotrichum 
Beurmanni, at least in the dilutions tried. 

Oidium albicans (sometimes called Saccharomyces 
albicans) is the cause of thrush (Gr. Soor ; Fr. Muguet), 
a localized disease of the mouth and pharynx, but also 
at times attacking the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, 
caecum, and anus ; besides being occasionally found 
developing on the vulva, in the vagina, on the pre- 
puce, and the glans penis. On rare occasions it has 
been found in the bladder, the kidney, the lungs, the brain, 
and in the blood. The oidium is composed of cylindrical 
filaments, made up of joints 50 to 60 micra long by 3 to 
5 micra in diameter. These give off branches, which bear 
spores by constriction at their free ends. Budding is 
also noted when grown in media containing sugars, allying 
it to the yeasts. Two varieties are described, one which 
liquefies gelatin and produces spores ; another which does 
not liquefy gelatin and yields small spores. It grows only 
in acid media. Like the yeasts, it can ferment sugars, but 
is not so powerful as they are. 

It is easily diagnosed microscopically. A fragment of 
the white membranous growth from the tongue or mouth 



YEASTS AND MOULDS 341 

is taken on a slide, teased out in a drop of acetic acid 
(which renders the epithelial cells almost invisible), and 
examined. The parasite is clearly seen as described 
above. The spores are round or oval. A stained specimen 
may be made by teasing in a distilled water drop, exposing 
to dry, fixing by heat or absolute alcohol, and staining 
with thionin. To isolate in culture, inoculate on gelatin, 
and incubate at a low temperature (15 to 20 C.) for 48 
hours. By that time white or creamy colonies appear, 
which are pure cultures of the thrush fungus. The ordinary 
microbes of the mouth are unable to develop at that 
temperature in the same time. 

Ringworm Fungi. The study of these is very complex. 
The mode of demonstration of them in the various parts 
affected is the same for all, and is summarized thus by 
Agasse-Lafont : 

Hairs. Prepare a solution of caustic potash of 30 per 
cent strength. Extract some of the diseased hairs, and 
put them in a drop of this solution on a slide. Put 
on a cover-glass, and heat moderately for several seconds 
over the flame of a spirit lamp, until the hairs can be 
crushed by gentle pressure on the cover-glass. Examine 
directly without staining, with a dry lens and medium 
light ; or first mount in glycerin or glycerin jelly. 

Epidermal Scales. Tease out with two sterile needles, 
and treat in the same manner. 

Nails. Reduce to powder with a nail file, and treat as 
above. 

Pus. Dry on slide, and examine directly without 
staining. 

Favus Crusts. Tease out, crush between two slides, and 
thereafter treat as for hairs. 

They are best cultivated on Sabouraud's medium 
Agar, 18 grm. ; peptone, 10 grm. ; maltose, 40 grm ; and 
water to 1000 c.c. Heat to dissolve, fill into tubes, and 
sterilize on three successive days. To inoculate tubes, 
take an infected hair, rinse it for a few seconds .in absolute 
alcohol, and wash thoroughly with sterile water. Then 
stab it into medium at several places, and grow at 18 C 
If first growth is not pure, remove plug, and inverting tube 



342 



PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 



over another, tap it smartly, when spores of the fungus 
will fall into the other tube and inoculate it. 

At 18 C. growth appears in seven days as fine white 
downy tufts, which increase in size and throw out rays. 
The surface of the growth becomes covered with a fine 
white powdery material. If grown on gelatin, liquefaction 
takes place in twelve to fifteen days. The microsporon 
fungus gives a more delicate growth than the megalosporon 
fungus, and also shows microscopically club-shaped ends 
to some of the filaments, which are not found in the other. 
In both forms, spores are found on one side of the threads 
(like the teeth of a crab) or at ends like a bunch of grapes.

Trichophyton tonsurans. This fungus is the cause of 
30 per cent of the ringworm of the scalp in Paris, and 
almost all the cases in Germany and Italy. In the east end 
of London, among the Polish, German, and Russian Jews, 
it is a common cause. It also is found in ringworm of the 
body, and at times causes an affection of the beard and the 
eyebrows, dry in character. Rarely, it affects the nails. 



YEASTS AND MOULDS 34a 

It is composed of simple filaments interlaced. In the hair 
bulbs, the filaments are inside the cuticle (endothrix) and 
running parallel to the long axis, and are formed of cells or" 
spores, almost square. These spores are 4 to 5 micra long, 
and are regularly arranged in lines. It is readily grown 
on Sabouraud's medium, showing in five to six days. It 
liquefies gelatin. A variety is quite frequently met with 
in the same places, T. Sabouraudi. It has a more fragile 
mycelium, and shows round spores. 

Trichophyton mentagrophytes is a cause of sycosis 
menti, a suppurative affection of the beard, and also of 
ringworm of the body, and a suppurating ringworm of the 
scalp in infants. The filaments are composed of strings 
of round spores of varying diameters (2 to 10 micra). The 
filamentary threads are mostly outside the hair cuticle ; 
(endo- and ectothrix) ; a few are found inside but towards 
the periphery. 

Microsporon or Microsporon Audouini is almost the 
sole cause of ringworm of the scalp in Scotland, and of 
96 per cent of the cases in London among British subjects. 
It is called the small-spored fungus as compared with the 
two given above, which are called " megalosporon," or 
large-spored. The parasite encloses the diseased hair in a 
whitish case formed of a mosaic of spores (ectothrix) . The 
spores are 2 to 3 micra in diameter, and from pressure 
against one another in the mosaic pattern, become poly- 
hedral in shape. When stained with carbol-thionin, the 
filaments are seen in the interior of the hair. 

Achorion Schoenleinii is the fungus which causes favus, 
or honeycomb ringworm, in which the characteristic 
feature is the formation of cup-shaped crusts of a sulphur- 
yellow colour. It most commonly attacks the scalp, but 
also affects the skin of the body and the nails. When 
attacking the nails, they become yellow and thickened. 
Besides the characteristic form of attack, the fungus may 
also produce a moist dermatitis resembling that due to 
the other ringworm fungi. 

In the hair the parasite is seen as wavy lines of mycelia 
composed of spores. The spores are irregular in size and 
shape, but mostly polyhedral. Rarely, the mycelium is 
septate and without spores. 



344 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

Favus prevails also in mice and cats, and from the 
latter animals many of the human cases arise. 

The Achorion Schoenleinii in culture grows best at 
30 to 35 C., and scarcely grows at 10 to 15 C., unlike th'e 
other ringworm fungi. It also liquefies gelatin more 
quickly than they, namely, in three to four days. It 
forms snowy-white circular or oval colonies, becoming 
finely powdered over the surface, and wrinkled in old 
culture. It grows best on beer -wort agar. To beer- wort 
diluted to a specific gravity of noo add 1-5 per cent 
of agar. Heat for two hours until dissolved. Filter, 
tube, and sterilize. (Avoid overheating.) 



CHAPTER XVIII. 

SPECIAL 
BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATIONS. 

BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF WATER. 
IN all natural unfiltered waters, except when derived 
from deep wells and springs (in which case nitration has 
already taken place through the strata) numbers of bacteria 
are found. The actual content is determined by the 
accumulated action of the following factors, namely : 

1. Presence or absence of local pollution. 

2. Presence or absence of natural purification. 

3. The season of the year. 

4. The rainfall at any particular period. 

The bacteria found in water may likewise be classed 
under four heads, as 

1. Harmless : the natural water bacteria. Such are the 
B. fmorescens liquefaciens, B. fluorescens non-liquefaciens, 
B. prodigiosus, B. violaceus, sarcinae, and spirilla. These 
all grow best at room temperature. 

2. Unobjectionable : those present from soil washings, 
as B. subtilis, B. mycoides, and B. megatherium. 

3. Objectionable : those derived from sewage, either 
directly or from sewage-polluted soil. Such are : (a) The 
B. proteus group ; (b) B. coli communis and its allies ; 
(c) Streptococci ; (d) Staphylococci ; (e) B. enteritidis 
sporogenes. 

4. Dangerous : those capable of causing infection by the 
alimentary canal. Such are the B. typhosus, B. para- 
typhosus, B. dysenteriae, and Sp. choleras. 

Samples. Stoppered sterile glass bottles should be 
used for sampling, each of at least 250 c.c. capacity (8 to 
10 oz.). The bottle should be thoroughly cleansed with 
soap and water, well rinsed with clean water, and sterilized 
(inverted and with stopper out) in steamer for one hour. 



346 



PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 



Allow the sterilizer to cool, then stopper the bottle, and 
remove and put in case. 

In sampling from a tap, run the water to waste for half 
an hour, and then fill bottle. Stopper, and label with 
particulars of place, time, and date. Examine at once, 
or pack in ice to prevent multiplication of organisms. 

In sampling from a lake, dip stoppered bottle well below 
surface ; remove stopper, and keep it under water ; allow 
bottle to fill ; replace stopper, and bring bottle to surface. 
Pack in ice. 

Examine samples as soon as possible after collection. 
Keep in ice in meantime. 

Dilutions. If the water is pure, no dilution will be 
required ; if impure, varying dilutions are used according 
to the degree of impurity. These may be made by the 
decimal mode of dilution described on page 367 ; or flasks 
may be kept ready containing 100 c.c. of sterile water. 
One c.c. of sample added to such a flask by sterile pipette 
gives practically a dilution of I in 100 ; i c.c. from this 
flask to another sterile 100 c.c. gives I in 10,000 ; and so on. 
To get i in 10, remove 10 c.c. by sterile pipette, and add 
10 c.c. of sample ; and from this dilution others are simi- 
larly made.

METHODS OF WATER EXAMINATION. These are based 
on the knowledge that the dangerous organisms in water 
are usually present from sewage pollution. Inasmuch as 
some of these forms are not easily isolated from water, the 
mode of procedure is to enumerate the total bacterial 
content, and to look for an organism, likewise present from 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 347 

sewage pollution, but easily found if present. Such an 
organism is Bacillus coli communis, which is presentlin 
enormous numbers in the sewage of man and animals ; 
and is therefore likely to be present in sewage contamin- 
ated water, even after great dilution. The B. coli is 
also a more resistant organism than the dangerous forms, 
and so serves to indicate pollution at a later stage than 
these could possibly be found in a water. So far it is not 
possible to distinguish B. coli of human origin from those 
of animal origin. It is stated that those of human origin 
are more pathogenic to animals. 

There are various methods in use in this country. A 
Committee of the Royal Institute of Public Health 
appointed to consider the " Bacterioscopic Examination of 
Water," reported in 1904 (Journal of State Medicine, vol. 
xii, p. 471) as follm 

Minimal Procedure. Unanimous^yeport : 

(a.) Enumeration of bacteria pffesent in_a-water 
sample, capable of growing on a medium incubated 
at room temperature (i8-22 C.). 

(b.) Search for Bacillus coli, and identification 
and enumeration of this organism, if present. 
Majority also recommended : 

(c.) Enumeration of bacteria present in sample 
capable of growing on a medium incubated at blood 
heat (36- 3 8 C.). 

(d.) Search for and enumeration of streptococci. 
(e.) Do not recommend routine examination for 
Bacillus enteritidis sporogenes ; but in exceptional 
and special cases advise that it be searched for. 

They further report on mode of collection of sample, 
media to be used in the tests, etc., of which the following 
is a brief summary : 

Collection of Sample. The sample should be collected in 
sterile stoppered glass bottles (minimum quantity 60 c.c., or 
2 ounces), and should be packed in ice. At least 10 ounces 
of sample should be sent, and its examination should be begun 
within three hours, or it should be left packed in ice. 

Enumeration of Bacteria. The media to be used are all to 
be standardized to have a reaction of +10 (Eyre's scale). 
Owing to changes in reaction, media should not be more than 



348 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

three weeks old. For cultivation at room temperature a 
choice may be made from the following : Distilled-water 
gelatin, nutrient gelatin, distilled-water agar, nutrient agar, 
and gelatin agar. At blood heat use agar or gelatin agar. 
Both agar and gelatin media should be used in any one test. 
Polluted water gives more colonies on nutrient gelatin than 
on distilled-water gelatin ; unpolluted water gives more with 
distilled-water gelatin. 

The size of the plates, the amount of medium to be used in 
plating, and the amounts of sample to be added to the media 
are all specified. Plates should be 10 c.m. in diameter ; 10 c.c. 
of medium should be used ; and for ordinary waters, 0-2 c.c., 
0-3 c.c., and 0-5 c.c. of sample should be added to gelatin 
media, and o-i c.c. and i-o c.c. of sample to agar media. The 
sample should be thoroughly shaken before removing these 
amounts, and the tubes should be thoroughly mixed by rota- 
tion before plating. Duplicates should be put up. In an 
unknown water, additional plates of dilutions (ten and one 
hundred fold) should be made. The colonies should be counted 
by the naked eye, and preferably by daylight. A lens may be 
used for doubtful colonies. The time of counting should be : 

For gelatin plates, at the end of 72 hours (3 days) ; 

For agar plates, after 40 to 48 hours. 

The gelatin plates should be inspected daily, in case counting 
becomes necessary earlier from liquefaction of the medium. 

Search for B. Coli. MacConkey's broth is recommended 
to be used, the sample to be added directly to the medium, 
and not first concentrated by filtration. 

Isolation of B. Coli. If indications of the presence of 
B. coli are got, then the organism must be isolated, cultivated, 
and identified. This is advised to be done by making surface 
cultures on plates of either : 

(a.) Litmus lactose agar (reaction +10) ; 
or (6.) Bile-salt lactose agar (MacConkey's) ; 
or (c.) Nutrose lactose agar (Drigalski and Conradi) ; 
or (d.) Ordinary nutrient gelatin. 

They consider (c) to be the best medium of all. Agar media 
save time. 

Identification and Tests. Having obtained coli-like colonies 
on plates made from the preliminary cultivations of the water 
in MacConkey's broth, subcultures must be made to identify 
the organism. The following subcultures should at least be 
made : 

(a.) Surface Agar, on which the abundant growth 
enables subcultures, etc., to be easily made if 
required. 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 349 

(b.) Stab and surface cultures in gelatin. These may 

be done in the same tube. 
(c.) Litmus milk incubated at 37 C. 
(d.) Glucose litmus medium. 
(e.) Lactose litmus medium. 
(/.) Peptone water for indol reaction. 

The Committee consider an organism to be typical B. colt 
when it conforms to the following characteristics: Small 
motile bacillus, non-sporing, decolorized by Gram, which 
grows well at 37 C. and at room temperature ; never liquefies 
gelatin ; produces permanent acidity in milk ; curdles milk 
within seven days at 37 C. ; ferments glucose and lactose, 
with formation of acid and gas ; grows in smooth thin surface 
on gelatin (not corrugated) ; and in gelatin stab grows well 
to the bottom of stab. This typical B. coli generally also 
forms indol, gives a thick yellowish-brown growth on potato, 
changes neutral-red, reduces nitrates to nitrites, and in fer- 
menting glucose half of the gas produced is absorbed by KOH. 
It sometimes ferments saccharose. 

The method here described is that used in the City 
Bacteriological Laboratory, Glasgow. 

I. Enumeration of Bacteria. Add o-i c.c. and i c.c. 
of sample by sterile pipette to 10 c.c. of liquefied gelatin 
and agar. Mix thoroughly by rotation and plate. Incubate 
the gelatin plates at 20 C. ; inspect daily, and count after 
three days, unless necessary earlier. 

Incubate the agar plates at 37 C., and count after two 
days. 

The ordinary water bacteria grow best on gelatin, 
whereas the intestinal forms grow best on the agar at 
blood heat. Hence, in a pure water the gelatin count 
should be much the greater ; and in an impure water the 
difference between the counts becomes less marked the 
more impure the water. The ratio between the two 
counts is also noted. This ratio of the number of organisms 
developing at room temperature to the number at blood- 
heat = 10 : i in pure water and = 10 : 2 or 3 or 5, etc., in 
polluted waters. The ratio is unreliable in surface waters 
in tropical countries, because B. liquefaciens, B. fluorescens 
liquefaciens, and B. fluorescens non-liquefaciens are com- 
monly present, and all grow well at 37 C., and are harmless.

Dr. A. C. Houston (Director of Water Examination to 
the Metropolitan Water Board, London), in addition 
to gelatin and agar media, for enumeration, also uses 
MacConkey's neutral-red, bile-salt, peptone, lactose agar 
(called rebipelagar for brevity). This is similarly inocu- 
lated and plated and incubated at 37. The colonies are 
counted on gelatin on the third day, and on agar and rebi-

II. Search for B. Coli. For this purpose MacConkey's 
broth is used of the composition neutral-red, bile-salt, 
peptone, glucose water,* in single, double, triple and quad- 
ruple strengths. The proper quantities are put into 
suitable sized tubes, and fermentation or Durham's tubes 



* Just as neutral-red, bile-salt peptone, lactose, agar has been 
shortened to rebipelagar (see p. 350), so MacConkey's broth with 
the various carbohydrates might be written thus : -

added, and the whole sterilized. Thereafter, the sample, 
having been well shaken, is added direct by sterile pipette, 
and always without concentration by filtration. If the 
sample is too strong, suitable dilutions are made, and I 
c.c. of the dilution is added. In the case of an unknown 
water the following tubes would be put up : 

o-oooi c.c. of sample to 10 c.c. of single strength medium.

50*0 ,, ,, 25 c.c. of triple

The tubes are put in a nest or basket, and incubated at 
37 C. for twenty-four hours. The possible results are 
four : 

(a.) Acid and gas. 

(b.) Acid, no gas. 

(c.) No acid, no gas ; turbidity. 

(d.) No visible change. 

Interest lies in (a) and (b), and they are commonly 
associated ; but the absence of (a) from all the tubes 
should not be held as precluding the necessity for further 
investigation. Note the tubes showing acid and gas, or 
acid alone ; say that the tube containing least amount of 
sample, and which shows acid and gas, is that to which 
o-i c.c. of sample was added, then the result is stated thus : 
Sample showed acid and gas formation down to o-i c.c. 
As a rule all the higher tubes will show acid and gas too. 

Some workers call this the " presumptive B. coli test ; " 
but as the following paragraphs (from Notter and Firth) 
show, the test is only a step on the way towards the isolation 
of B. coli. 

MacConkey's Neutral-red, Bile-salt, Peptone, Glucose Water. 
Reaction of certain bacteria with : 

GROUP i. Bacteria producing acid + gas. 

B. coli communis, B. enteritidis (Gaertner), B. 
paracolon, B. paratyphosus, B. pneumoniae, B. lactis 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 353 

aerogenes, B. acidi lactici, B. neapolitanus, B. icter- 
oides, B. psittacosis, B. cloacae, B. proteus vulgaris, 
bacillus of hog cholera, bacillus of epidemic jaundice, 
B. oxytocus perniciosus, and B. capsulatus. 

GROUP 2. Bacteria producing acid, but not gas. 

B. typhosus, B. dysenteriae, B. choleras, B. pyo- 
genes fcetidus, streptococci and staphylococci. 

The first group can be subdivided into four : 

(a.) The proteus group of motile bacilli : gelatin-lique- 
fying, form acid and gas in glucose, maltose, saccharose, 
and galactose, but not in lactose, laevulose, arabinose, 
raffinose, mannite, sorbite, dulcite, adonite, dextrin, starch, 
or inulin ; curdle milk slowly with acid ; commonly produce 
indol in peptone solutions. 

(b.) B. coli communis family : motile bacilli, non-gelatin- 
liquefying, producing acid and gas in all the above except 
saccharose, adonite, starch, or inulin ; curdle milk rapidly 
with acid, but do not peptonize clot ; form indol. 

(c.) B. lactis aerogenes group : non-motile bacilli, non- 
gelatin-liquefying, producing acid and gas in all the above 
except three dulcite, adonite, and inulin ; curdle milk 
rapidly with acid ; do not peptonize clot ; form indol. 

(d.) The paracolon-enteritidis series : motile bacilli, non- 
gelatin-liquefying, producing acid and gas in all but lactose, 
saccharose, adonite, starch, or inulin ; do not clot milk 
but finally render it alkaline ; do not form indol. 

III. Isolation of B. Coli. 

(a.) From each tube showing acid and gas, and acid 
alone, make a surface smear with one platinum loopful on 
a plate of neutral red, bile salt, peptone, lactose, agar (rebi- 
pelagar) containing i part of crystal violet in 10,000. 
Incubate these plates for twenty-four hours at 37 C. 

(b.) Examine thereafter. If a plate shows only one kind 
of colony, inoculate an agar slope from a mixture of these. 
If more than one form of colony is seen on any plate, 
inoculate agar slopes from each kind of colony. Incubate 
the various inoculated agar tubes (properly marked or 
labelled) at 37 C. for twenty-four hours. This growth on 
agar gives sufficient material for subsequent steps ; but 
it is also necessary to revive any fermentative powers

possessed by any of the bacteria, as these are found to 
be depreciated by growth on the plate medium. 

(c.) From each growth on agar the following subcultures 
are made : Gelatin stab, litmus milk, peptone water, and 
seven tubes of MacConkey's broth, containing respec- 
tively the following carbohydrates : Glucose, lactose, 
saccharose, dulcite, mannite, adonite, inulin. 

The gelatin is incubated at 20 C. for eight to ten days. 
The other tubes are incubated at 37 C. for seven days. 
An organism which does not liquefy gelatin, and which 
gives acid and clot in litmus milk, indol in peptone water, 
and acid and gas in glucose, lactose, dulcite and mannite, 
but not in saccharose, adonite, or inulin, is called Bacillus 
coli communis. The nature of organisms giving varying 
reactions from these may be established from the preced- 
ing table, for which I am indebted to Dr. R. M. Buchanan. 
Where a reaction here given contradicts that stated else- 
where in the text, it serves to show that different results 
have been observed. 

Houston adopts a different method of arriving at what 
he calls a " typical B. coli " characteristic of excremental 
pollution. 

He likewise uses MacConkey's glucose broth (rebipegluqua), 
but incubates at 37 C. for two days (forty-eight hours). If 
no gas developed, the result was considered negative. On 
the other hand, if gas developed, he then made subcultures 
from tubes showing acid and gas on to gelatin slopes, and 
incubated for two days at 2o-22 C. If no colonies developed 
resembling in any way that of B. coli, the result was considered 
negative. If coli-like colonies were present, one of the most 
typical looking colonies was chosen for subculture into glucose 
gelatin, and a " shake " culture made in the customary way. 
After twenty-four hours' incubation at 2o-22 C., if no gas 
developed, the result was entered as negative ; just as if no 
growth had occurred in the oblique gelatin cultures, or a 
growth of microbes in no way resembling B. coli. 

But if gas production was noted, the result was recorded 
as positive, and the other biological attributes of the coli-like 
microbe were studied in neutral-red broth cultures for 
fluorescence (fl) ; in lactose peptone cultures for acid and gas 
formation (ag) ; in peptone water cultures for indol formation 
(in) ; and in litmus milk cultures for acid clotting of the 
medium (ac). The complete" combination of these positive 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 357 

characters was expressed by the word " flaginac." Since 
January, 1907, he has modified his method in this wise. 
Finding that, practically speaking, a " flaginac " B. coli is a 
B. coli indistinguishable, according to the tests used, from the 
typical B. coli of excremental pollutions ; and that in the 
great majority of cases a glucose fermenting coli-like microbe 
will also produce fluorescence (fl) in neutral-red broth cultures ; 
and, further, that lactose fermenting (ag) coli-like microbes 
nearly always clot milk (ac) ; there is, therefore, justification 
for omitting the neutral-red broth and litmus milk tests, and 
relying solely on the lactose peptone (ag) and the indol (in) 
tests. Practically, in the case of the London waters, an "agin " 
B. coli may be regarded as presumably a " flaginac " B. coli 
(Report for January, 1907). On this basis he has modified 
the above method, in order to make it more rapid. The first 
growth is as before, on MacConkey's glucose broth for forty- 
eight hours. The secondary cultures are on rebipelagar 
(instead of gelatin) for twenty-four hours. From red coli-like 
colonies on this medium, subcultures are made on glucose, 
lactose, and saccharose, gelatin media and in peptone water. 
After twenty-four hours gas production in the carbohydrate 
media is considered positive ; and indol is tested for in the 
peptone water. Fermentation of lactose and production of 
indol are looked for, " agin " results ; if saccharose is also 
fermented, the result is recorded as a " sagin " one. (For full 
description see the January, 1907, Report.) In this way 
Houston claims that " it becomes possible to complete the 
tests for excremental pollution in water within four days." 
It will be noticed that Houston accepts as a " type of B. coli " 
an organism fermenting saccharose. His statement on the 
subject is as follows : 

' The typical B. coli of the human intestinal tract may be 
divided into two classes, according to their action on 
saccharose. The majority do not ferment this sugar,' or ~act 
on it only to a slight extent. Hence typical B. coli which 
do not ferment saccharose would seem to be more significant 
of undesirable pollution than those which do ferment it." 

The student should note that Houston uses the term 
" typical B. coli " on a different basis from many other 
bacteriologists, who would be inclined to speak of his " typical 
B. coli " rather as a " coliform organism." 

Houston has found that out of every 100 coliform organisms 
present in raw Thames water, 70 to 80 per cent conform to 
his " typical B. coli " ; whereas the same water after storage 
and filtration shows a reduction in the coliform organisms 



358 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

which is more marked among the " typicals," which now 
number 40 to 50 per cent only of the total coliforms. " This 
means that the ratio or proportion between the typical B. coli 
and the B. coli (both typical and non-typical) is altered during 
the purification processes in the direction of reducing the 
number of typical B. coli. This constitutes an intrinsic 
difference between the bacterial flora of the raw and filtered 
waters, and as the typical B. coli are considered specially 
significant of undesirable excremental pollution, it is a 
difference which may mean far more than the actual figures 
seem to indicate. The processes which affect this modifica- 
tion of the original biological attributes of the raw waters may 
operate far more powerfully in the direction of eliminating 
the microbes of epidemic disease " (Fifth Annual Report, p. 12). 
It should also be noted that Houston uses glucose, lactose, 
and saccharose gelatin media. His statement on this point is 
as follows : " Particular attention must again be directed to 
the value of these solid gelatin sugar media. Times without 
number a microbe which failed to show any visible develop- 
ment of gas in liquid sugar media, has been found to give 
abundant gas when grown in solid gelatin media containing 
the same sugars." First Report on Research Work, p. 7). 

These media are described on page 49 of the Report on the 
Metropolitan Water Supply for January, 1907. They have 
the following composition : 

Lemco . . . . . . i per cent. 

Peptone . . . . . . . . 2 ,, 

Gelatin . . . . . . 7-5 ,, 

KOH . . i c.c. of a 5 per cent solution. 

Add i per cent of glucose, lactose, or saccharose. The 
glucose tubes are not tinted, the lactose tubes are tinted with 
litmus, and the saccharose tubes with neutral-red. 

After inoculation, such tubes are placed for exactly three 
hours in the blood-heat incubator. This melts the gelatin, 
allows of some multiplication of the organisms to take place, 
and helps to effect their distribution throughout the medium. 
The tubes are then placed in the ice chest for half an hour to 
allow the gelatin to set, and thereafter incubated for twenty- 
four hours at 2O-22 C. Abundant gas formation (in a posi- 
tive result) is visible long before the twenty-four hours are 
completed. 

In such a medium liquefaction of gelatin can also be noted. 

IV. Streptococci. To 10 c.c. of MacConkey's glucose 
broth, quadruple strength, add 50 c.c. of sample water, and 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 359 

incubate at 37 C. for twenty-four hours. Examine a 
hanging drop, and if cocci are seen, make a subculture by 
smearing a platinum loopful of culture over a plate of 
Drigalski and Conradi's medium (nutrose, -lactose, -agar). 
Incubate at 37 C. for twenty-four hours, and then sub- 
culture all the minute colonies into tubes of Houston's 
Lemco medium (see p. 222), containing 0-5 per cent of 
lactose, mannite, rafnnose, saccharose, and salicin respect- 
ively, and also into milk. Incubate for two days at 37 C., 
and observe results. 

From various researches, extending over ten years, into 
the characteristics of faecal streptococci (see Fifth Research 
Report, and other references there, p. 13), Houston has 
found that of 100 " sewage works " streptococci 

All produced acid in lactose and rafnnose media. 

All clotted milk. 

None reduced nitrates to nitrites. 

All but three produced acid in salicin medium. 

Forty-nine produced acid in saccharose medium. 

Only four produced acid in mannite medium. 

These reactions differ from those given by Andrewes and 
Horder for streptococcus fsecalis (see p. 224). 

In 1909, out of 156 samples of raw river water (Thames, 
Lee, and New River, 52 from each), 28 were found to contain 
streptococci in i c.c. ; 1908 subcultures were made, and from 
these 71 streptococci were isolated, plus 3 from o-i c.c. of 
water, making 71 -j- 30, or 101 in all, or say in, so as to over- 
state any error. That is, in lactose-positive streptococci 
were found in 156 c.c. of raw river water, which amount 
would yield of all bacteria on gelatin plate over two million 
colonies ; on agar plate about sixty thousand ; and on bile- 
salt agar about six and a half thousand. The ratio, therefore, 
of streptococci to total bacteria (growing on gelatin plate) in 
the raw river water works out at one to twenty thousand. 
The type of streptococcus usually met with in these 156 
samples, Houston describes as the la-mi-ra-sac-sal variety 
(i.e. acid in lactose, clot in milk, acid in raffinose, saccharose, 
and sa/icin media). As noted above, of the faecal streptococci 
(100) examined by him, 97 clotted milk, and produced acid in 
lactose, rafnnose, and salicin ; and of these 97, 48 produced 
acid and 49 no appreciable change in a saccharose medium. 

In other researches he found that in human faeces of the 



360 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

streptococci isolated, 15 per cent were of the lamirasacsal 
variety, whereas in cow-dung 58 per cent of those isolated 
were of this variety. 

Houston gives thus his chief reasons for considering the 
streptococcus test of value in the examination of water 
supplies : 

1. That streptococci are superabundant in human 
faeces. 

2. That faecal streptococci are absent or non-discover- 
able in a relatively large volume of pure water. 

3. That faecal streptococci do not multiply in pure water. 

4. That some faecal streptococci are of feeble vitality, 
and that the presence of such in a water, if they could be 
differentiated from their more robust companions, would 
seem to indicate pollution of recent and therefore of a 
specially dangerous nature. Dr. Houston concludes that 
human faeces usually contain a multitude of streptococci, 
100,000 per gramme being an underestimate of the average 
number. 

V. Bac. Enteritidis Sporogenes. Inoculate 10 c.c. of 
sample water into 10 c.c. " whole " sterile milk. Heat to 
80 to 85 C. for ten minutes. Cool in running water, and 
incubate anaerobicallyin aBuchner's tube at 37 C. for forty- 
eight hours. Examine for coagulation. The curd is almost 
completely separated from the whey, and is torn by gas 
formation, part gathering with the cream at the top. The 
whey is only slightly turbid, and contains numerous bacilli. 
The growth has the odour of butyric acid, and the B. 
enteritidis sporogenes is distinguished from the B. butyricus 
of Botkin only by its pathogenicity when injected into a 
guinea-pig, which dies twenty-four hours after, with green 
discoloration and oedema at the seat of entry, and there 
may be gas formation, gangrene, and a disagreeable odour. 

VI. Isolation of B. Typhosus. This is a very difficult 
procedure for various reasons. The most important are : 
The small numbers of B. typhosus usually present ; their 
rapid disappearance from sewage-polluted water, so that 
they are often absent when fresh cases arising from a 
polluted water occur that is, they die out in about the 
same time as the incubation period of the disease ; and the 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 361 

fact that the organism is easily outgrown by the other 
excremental bacteria, and so is crowded out in most media. 
When, to help matters, some agent, inhibitory to the 
others, is added to the medium, the typhoid organism is 
likewise affected, though to a lesser degree. 

From all these causes attempts at isolation of the B. 
typhosus from water supplies usually fail. 

The first step is to concentrate the water. This can be 
done by : 

(a.) Centrifugalization of large quantities, and 
plating the sediment. 

(b.) Precipitation by entanglement in a chemical 
precipitate, such as weak soda solution and ferrous 
sulphate added to the water, or weak alum and 
lime-water solutions. Centrifuge, dissolve precipi- 
tat? in neutral potassium tartrate, and plate on 
solid media. 

(c.) Filtration through unglazed porcelain (Pas- 
teur-Chamberland bougie). Wash bougie by brush- 
ing with 10 c.c. of sterile water, and use product to 
smear plates. The candle should filter from without 
inwards. Bacteria are apt to be lost in the pores of 
the filter. Some filter from within outwards, add 
broth, and thus get a primary culture. 

(d.) Evaporation of the bulk of the water at 
blood-heat under reduced atmospheric pressure. 
The enrichment method of Hoffman and Ficker is to 
add nutrose, caffein, and crystal violet to the sample, to 
make it a suitable growing medium for B. typhosus. For 
exact proportions see page 239. 

The first method that is, Centrifugalization is mostly 
favoured. , 

One hundred c.c. of the sample are centrifuged. The 
sediment is plated direct on to rebipelagar, and incubated 
at 37 C. for twenty-four hours. All the colourless colonies 
are subcultured on to agar slopes, and incubated, at 37 C. 
for twenty-four hours. Thereafter subcultures are made 
into gelatin stab, litmus milk, peptone water, and glucose, 
lactose, saccharose, dulcite, mannite, adonite, and inulin 
media. A motile organism, giving negative results to all 
these reactions except litmus milk, in which it gives acid

and then permanent alkalinity, and glucose and mannite, 
in both of which it produces acid only, may be considered

serum. (See p. 191.)

SUMMARY OF SOME RESULTS : see preceding page. 

BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF AIR. 

Various methods are employed : 

1. Exposure of Plates for a Definite Time. Incubate ; 
enumerate ; identify. 

2. Hesse's Method. A glass cylinder, 18" X 2", is closed 
at one end by an indiarabber cover, tightly adjusted. 
The other end is stopped with a close-fitting rubber cork, 
through which passes a glass tube, attached by rubber 
tubing to a litre flask filled with water, and which, in its 
turn, is similarly attached to another litre flask, empty and 
having its outlet tube clamped. Along the bottom of the 
cylinder, 50 c.c. of nutrient gelatin are spread, or may be 
rolled all over the inside of tube. The whole is rested on a 
tripod stand. Sterilize in the usual way and keep to see if 
sterile. To test air : pierce a small hole in rubber cover, 
and open pinchcock on empty litre flask, which place lower 
than other. Water begins to run from the upper flask to 
the lower, and aspirates air through the pierced hole over 
gelatin. By reversing the flasks, another litre of air can 
be aspirated, and so on. Finally, detach the tubing from 
cylinder, cover the ends with sterile wool, and incubate for 
twenty-four hours onwards. 

This method has been largely superseded by simpler ones. 
All the microbes may not be caught on the gelatin surface. 

3. Frankland's Method. A tube, 5" X ", containing 
two plugs of glass wool. Aspirate a known quantity of 
air, remove the wool, and add to nutrient gelatin, and plate. 
The glass wool mixes with the gelatin. 

4. Petri's Method. Like Frankland's, only using sand 
instead of glass wool. There is apt to be some difficulty 
in distinguishing between colonies and grains of sand.

PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 



5. Sedgwick and Tucker's Method. A specially shaped 
tube is used, in which are placed cotton plugs (3), and cane 
sugar is packed into a narrow part of the tube. One plug 
is removed, and air aspirated through the sugar (the whole 
apparatus having been previously sterilized at 120 C.). 
The plug is then replaced, the sugar is shaken down into 
a wider part of the tube, and liquid gelatin is poured in. 
The sugar melts into the gelatin, and a roll culture is 
made before the latter solidifies. Incubate at 22 C. and 
count colonies daily. 

Organisms found. Yeasts, Spores of moulds, Strepto- 
coccus brevis, B. coli, B. mycoides, B. enteritidis sporogenes, 
Streptococcus epidermidis, Streptococcus salivarius. 

The last two serve to indicate pollution by particles of 
skin and saliva. The preceding ones indicate pollution 
by dirt from the street, brought in on the boots, if the 
air tested is that of a room ; or it may be blown in. 

The effect of stirring dust is to increase the ratio of 
bacteria to moulds, whereas in still air, bacteria settle 
down much more rapidly than moulds. The purer the 
air, the more nearly do the numbers of the bacteria and 
of the moulds approximate. This is well shown in the 
figures found by the examination of i cubic metre of air 
(1000 litres or 220 gallons), taken in Paris and the suburbs, 
in the various seasons.

Particulate pollution of the air by material from the 
upper respiratory passages from the skin and from the 
street may all be detected by exposing plates filled with 
broth to the air for a definite time ; incubating anaerobi- 
cally for forty-eight hours at 37 C., and examining for 
certain test organisms. (Gordon.) 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 365 

BACTERIOLOGICAL EXAMINATION OF SOIL. 

A quantity of soil may be collected in a platinum or 
metal spoon, or in a sterile tin trough, or by a Fraenkel's 
borer. A definite quantity is ground up in a sterile Tnortar 
and then mixed with known quantities of sterile water. 
Cultures are then made from definite quantities of these 
dilutions, and the number of B. coli, of streptococci, and 
of spores of B. enteritidis sporogenes, are determined and 
returned as so many per gramme of the original soiL 
Houston found 100,000 (of all bacteria) per grm. in sandy 
uncultivated soil, and 1,500,000 per grm. in garden soil. 
Spores are determined by adding I c.c. of a dilution to 
10 c.c. of gelatin ; heat to 80 C. for ten minutes to destroy 
non-sporing bacteria, plate, incubate, and count as late as 
liquefaction (if present) will allow. The examination 
for specific pathogenic bacteria is carried out by injecting 
animals subcutaneously, with some of the material or a 
dilution of it in normal saline (0-8 per cent). 

Organisms Found. The bacteria found in soil are : 
(a.) Putrefactive organisms 

B. mycoides (earth bacillus). 
B. subtilis (hay bacillus). 
B. megatherium. 

(b.) , Nitrifying organisms or nodule bacteria 
Nitroso-bacteria, or nitrite formers.

DUST, SEWAGE AND SEWAGE EFFLUENTS, 
AND EXCREMENTAL MATTERS. 

These are examined on similar principles, except that a 
dry solid, like dust, may be weighed out, crushed in a sterile 
mortar, and made into a primary dilution with distilled 
water. Gordon found that in the dust collected at air inlet 
at House of Commons there were under 10 bacteria per 



366 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

grm. ; in debating chamber 100,000 per grm. (B. coli 
1000, streptococci 10, B. enteritidis sporogenes 1000) ; in 
the division lobby 1,000,000 per grm. (containing 1000 of 
each of.B. coli, streptococci, and B. enteritidis sporogenes) : 
and in New Palace Yard, 100,000 per grm., of which 10,000 
were B. coli, under 1000 streptococci, and 100 B. enteritidis 
sporogenes). 

MILK. 

In a healthy cow the milk within the udder is sterile. 
In the milk ducts and teats a certain number of bacteria 
may be found, even in healthy animals. From the position 
of the udder and the mode of milking, it is not possible 
to collect milk under aseptic precautions, and in the 
most favourable circumstances freshly taken milk in the 
pail will yield 100 to 500 bacteria per c.c. Under ordinary 
conditions the yield is much greater, varying from 2000 
to 6000 per c.c where less care is used, and with careless 
manipulation (the usual method), 30,000 to 100,000 per c.c. 
With such a bacterial content from the beginning, it is not 
surprising that at summer temperatures the count in 
twenty-four hours should be enormous, reaching into 
millions and even hundreds of millions per c.c. The 
species found include almost all known varieties. 
Swithinbank and Newman describe 120 " milk bacteria," 
apart from organisms of water, soil, etc. The varieties 
found are there largely because of their presence in the 
environment, or their power to outgrow other species under 
the cultural conditions. Pathogenic bacteria are found in 
milk either (i) derived from the cow, e.g., tubercle 
bacillus, actinomyces, anthrax bacilli, streptococci, foot and 
mouth disease germ ; or (2) from the introduction into it 
of infectious material of human origin, e.g., typhoid, diph- 
theria, germ of scarlatina, cholera ; or (3) from the air, when 
kept in unsuitable conditions. Under (2), the milking of 
cows, or the handling of milk by persons suffering from 
disease or by acute or chronic carriers of disease germs, 
the use of infected water to rinse cans, and the pollution by 
flies, are the main acting causes. The milk of infected 
goats contains the germ of Malta fever. Besides these, 
milk contains many faecal organisms derived from the 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 367 

soiled and uncleansed skin near the udder, and from the 
dust of the byre. 

Suggested Bacteriological Standard (Newman). 
(.) Acidity of 100 c.c. + 2 c.c. phth. (o-i per cent) to 
be not more than 25 c.c. N/io alkali. 
(b.) No excess of blood or pus cells. 
(c.) No B. coli, B. enteritidis sporogenes, nor B. 
enteritidis (Gaertner) in i c.c. 
(d.) The milk to be non-virulent. 

The New York Milk Commission specify that certified 
milk shall contain not more than 30,000 bacteria per c.c., 
and in Philadelphia, the Commission standard is not more 
than 10,000 per c.c., and little difficulty has been experienced 
in conforming to this test. Boston has fixed a limit for 
ordinary milk of 500,000 per c.c., Milwaukee of 250,000, 
and Rochester, N.Y., of 100,000 per c.c. The average 
content in this country is 400,000 per c.c., as sold. 

Microscopic Examination. Shows round oil globules 
and a little epithelium. Abnormal constituents are : 
much epithelium, pus cells, conglomerate masses and 
casts of lacteal tubes, and colostrum. 

Quantitative Examination. Decimal mode of dilution. 
Add 9 c.c. of water to each of a number of test tubes, plug, 
and sterilize. 

Add i c.c. of milk sample to No. i tube : 

dilution = i-io, or i c.c. = o-i c.c. milk. 
Add i c.c. of No. i tube to No. 2 tube : 

dilution = i-ioo, or i c.c. = o-oi c.c. milk. 
Add i c.c. of No. 2 tube to No. 3 tube : 

dilution = i-iooo, or i c.c. = o-ooi c.c. milk. 
Add i c.c. of No. 3 tube to No. 4 tube : 

dilution = 1-10,000, or i c.c. = o-oooi c.c. milk. 

And so on for any number of dilutions, mixing well each 
time, with sterile pipette. 

Plate i c.c. of the various dilutions on gelatin and 
agar, and count colonies in twenty-four to forty-eight 
hours. (Begin plating with weakest dilutions, if the 
same pipette is to be used throughout.)

Qualitative Examination. 

i. FOR F/ECAL ORGANISMS. 

Inoculate tubes of MacConkey's bile-salt glucose peptone 
(10 c.c.) with i c.c. from each dilution, beginning with the 
weakest (i c.c. =0-000001 c.c. milk, or one-millionth), and 
continuing in reverse order. Also one tube with i c.c. of 
undiluted milk, and one tube of double strength broth 
(MacConkey's) with 10 c.c. of undiluted milk. Incubate 
for two days at 37 C. All the cultures showing acid and 
gas are subcultured as detailed under WATER (page 353). 

2. FOR B. ENTERITIDIS SPOROGENES. 

Inoculate tubes containing 15 c.c. sterile whole milk, with 
o-ooi c.c., o-oi c.c., o-i c.c., i c.c., 10 c.c. and a tube con- 
taining 30 c.c. with 100 c.c. Heat to 80 C. for 10 minutes 
for the smaller amounts, and 20 minutes for the larger. 
Incubate anaerobically at 37 C. for 2 days, and observe 
for the " enteritidis change or reaction " (page 319). 

3. FOR TUBERCLE BACILLI. 

Centrifugalize and take sediment, make a film, fix, 
clear with ether and alcohol, and stain for acid-fast 
bacilli. Failure to find them is inconclusive ; on the 
other hand, all acid-fast forms found are not tubercle 
bacilli. In case of failure, or of success to prove nature, 
use the animal experiment. Centrifuge 250 c.c. of milk, 
add sterile water to sediment, and inject into a guinea-pig 
intraperitoneally. The animal is killed in three weeks (if 
it has not died before that time from septicaemia or severe 
infection), and the carcase sought for typical lesions. 
Among acid-fast organisms, the forms found in hay, butter, 
etc., are slightly pathogenic, but are easily distinguished by 
their rapid growth on cultivation. An attempt at cultiva- 
tion from the lesions in the guinea-pig should therefore be 
made. 

The following excerpt from Dr. J. Hume Patterson's 
Report for 1910, to the County M.O.H., Lanarkshire, 
details some experiments on the distribution of the tubercle 
bacilli in the " fore," " mid," and " strippings " milk : 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 369 

Tubercular Disease of the Udder of Cows. MILK. During 
the year (1910) 227 samples of milk from 225 cows with 
suspected disease of the udder were examined, 53 of which 
gave positive results, giving an average of 23-5 per cent. 
From the beginning of February, special attention has been 
given to the examination of smear preparations, in order that 
an immediate report might be given, instead of waiting three 
weeks for the animal inoculation test. Out of 44 specimens 
so examined, 31 were found positive. The milk in each case 
was stopped within two days of the taking of sample. 

It might here be mentioned in connection with the examina- 
tion of smear preparations, that an elaborate and complicated 
process of staining is not necessary, as a good result does not 
depend so much on the process of staining, as the time spent 
on the examination of the film. The method now adopted 
is the ordinary Ziehl-Neelson, the film, after discoloration, 
being well washed in absolute alcohol to clear it up. 

All the samples giving negative smears were subjected to 
the animal inoculation test. 

Twenty-seven samples of milk were obtained from four of 
the positive cows, for the purpose of ascertaining whether 
the " fore," " mid," or " strippings " milk contained the 
most bacilli, also whether the bacilli were more numerous in 
the cream than in the deposit. The samples were taken by 
the County Veterinary Surgeon. 

In each case the whole of the milk from the affected quarter 
was drawn off in separate consecutive samples, the last one 
always containing the last drop of milk procurable. 

Each specimen when received was centrifugalized for 15 
minutes, and smear preparations made with one platinum 
loopful of the cream and of the deposit. The loopful was 
then thoroughly mixed on the slide and spread over an area 
the breadth of the slide and one inch in length. The films 
were stained by Ziehl-Neelson's method. The count, which 
of course was an approximate one, was carried out by running 
the T V oil immersion lens straight across the centre of the 
film, counting the bacilli in each field and multiplying the 
total by twelve. (The film being an inch in length and the 
lens used T L). Where the bacilli were few in number, the whole 
film was examined and counted. The results obtained were 
as shown in the table on following page. 

It will be seen from the results obtained from Cows I., II., 
and IV., that the " mid " milk was richest in bacilli, and 
would evidently be the proper part to take when such a milk 
was to be examined, more especially by smear preparation. 
No reliance could be placed on the samples taken from Cow 
No. III., as the milk was too small in amount.

From the samples taken from Cows II., III., and IV., it 
was clearly shown that the deposit is the proper part of the 
specimen to take for the examination, it containing by far 
the greater number of tubercle bacilli. 

4. FOR ACTINOMYCES. 

Make a film from sediment, and stain by acid-fast 
method. Actinomycosis in the udder of the cow is 
usually alleged to be rare, but is stated to be more 
common in the sow. In an article on " The Occurrence 
of Actinomycosis in Cows' Udders," by Dr. J. Hume 
Patterson, in the Journal of Meat and Milk Hygiene (vol. i, 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 371 

No. i, Jan. 1911), the writer cites evidence which goes to 
show that it may not be so uncommon. Out of fifty 
specimens from different udders submitted to him for 
suspected tubercle, in five cases the lesions proved to be 
actinomycotic. The lesions in each case were indistinguish- 
able by the naked eye from those of tuberculosis. On 
cutting into the substance of the udder numerous cream- 
coloured foci, similar to tubercles, were seen, ranging from 
the size of a pin-head to that of a pea. The part affected 
was also of a brownish tint, as is so often seen in tubercu- 
losis of this tissue. Smear preparations showed elements 
of actinomyces in four of the cases ; in one, no elements 
were found, but on making sections typical actinomyces 
were found. All the others were confirmed by making 
paraffin sections. In one of the smears both tubercle 
bacilli and actinomyces were found ; and if not on one's 
guard, such a case could be readily dismissed as tuber- 
culosis without looking for actinomycosis. Dr. Patterson 
says : "I am confident from my experience in these cases 
that if each suspected tubercular udder were subjected to 
a microscopical examination, the percentage of actinomy- 
cotic udders would be greater than is generally supposed. 

In regard to milk, many of the samples, taken by veteri- 
nary surgeons inspecting dairy herds from cows having 
what appeared to be marked tubercular lesion of the udder, 
have proved negative even on animal inoculation. Dr. 
Patterson asks the question : " Might these not be cases 
of actinomycosis ? " and cites the following case : 

" During last winter's inspection (1909-10) a case occurred 
where the lesion of the udder was markedly nodular and 
similar to tubercle. A sample of the milk was taken, and a 
guinea-pig inoculated with negative result. Not satisfied 
with this result, samples were again taken from all four 
quarters of the same cow. These samples again proved 
negative on animal inoculation. Smear preparations from 
these last samples, made from the deposit of the centrifugalized 
milk, showed a few acid-fast rod-shaped, and a few fragments 
of club-shaped, elements suggestive of actinomyces, in those 
samples taken from both hind quarters and from the left fore 
quarter. I was unable to procure the udder for further 
examination, but am convinced that this was a case of 
actinomycosis. In actinomycosis of the human subject, it is 



372 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

yet doubtful how infection takes place, as the cereal theory 
has been partly exploded, through cases arising which had no 
connection with grain; and I think it is just possible infection 
may be conveyed by the milk of such a cow as I have quoted, 
where the elements of the disease were found in the fluid. 
If that be so, this disease, as affecting the udder of the cow, 
warrants more attention than is given to it at the present 
moment in connection with our milk supplies." In this regard 
the present writer was consulted in 1910 by a young man of 
about twenty years, who had recently returned to Scotland 
from Canada. He had been treated in several hospitals for 
tuberculosis. The history being irregular, his spit was sent to 
the City Bacteriological Laboratory (Glasgow) for examination 
with this note : "If you do not find tubercle bacilli, look for 
something else." Dr. Sutherland, who examined the speci- 
men, found actinomyces, and the diagnosis was confirmed 
later in the Glasgow Royal Infirmary. He died some months 
later, but a post-mortem examination was not obtained. The 
history bearing on the point at issue is this : About two years 
previously he left his position as an office boy in Glasgow, and 
went to near Calcary, Alberta, Canada, where he became a 
farmer's boy. One of the cows he had to milk had a chronic 
sore on its udder, and he was warned to milk this cow gently, 
so as not to make the sore bleed. After about one year he 
took ill at this farm with a sore throat, followed by a swollen 
right submaxillary gland. The gland was incised and healed 
well. Then another swelling appeared, and another, and so on. 
This certainly looked like a milk infection, but verification 
was not possible. 

5. FOR JOHNE'S BACILLI. 

The prevalence of Johne's disease in cattle in Great 
Britain being now well established, the bacilli may find 
their way into the milk from the diarrhoeal stools in the 
earlier stages of the disease. The bacilli are shorter than 
the tubercle bacilli, but are equally acid-fast and alcohol- 
fast. Twort has cultivated them on egg media. 

6. FOR STREPTOCOCCI. 

Houston advises the use of the medium of Drigalski and 
Conradi (lactose-nutrose-agar) in plates. The plates are 
inoculated by smearing over the surface of them o-i c.c. of 
each of the dilutions given above. Incubate twenty-four to 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 373 

forty-eight hours at 37 C. , and subculture the minute colonies 
formed into broth, and repeat cultivation as to time and tem- 
perature. Make films from the broth and examine micro- 
scopically, and if found in pure culture, subject the organism 
to the differential tests for streptococci and to nitrate broth 
test. According to Houston, 58 per cent of the Streptococci 
faecalis of the cow are of the lamirasacsal variety ; that is, 
clot milk and ferment lactose, raffinose, saccharose, and 
salicin. It forms short chains, and is not pathogenic to 
mice. The S. pyogenes does not clot milk, ferments 
lactose, saccharose, and sometimes salicin, but does not 
ferment raffinose, and is pathogenic to mice, forms long 
chains, and does not reduce nitrates. 

Leucocyte Test. In testing for chronic mastitis in cows, 
Trommsdorff found that the deposit of leucocytes after 
centrifugalizing the milk in a specially-shaped tube, was a 
good guide as to the necessity for further investigation. 
In an enquiry on these lines, he found 20 per cent of chronic 
mastitis in cows, and it was associated with the presence 
in very large numbers of capsulated streptococci. Such 
cows give less milk The milk must be drawn directly 
from the animal before one can say that the streptococcus 
is from the udder of the cow. 

CENTRIFUGALIZATION OF MILK 

Is used to precipitate the gross dirt, pus cells and 
leucocytes, and bacteria. According to Scheurlen, the 
ordinary milk bacteria in the proportion of 75 per cent 
of them go into the cream, as do also the organisms of 
anthrax, typhoid, and cholera. The other 25 per cent of 
these remain in the separated milk. On the other hand, 
tubercle bacilli are largely found in the sediment, a few 
only passing into the cream and separated milk. 

FERMENTATIONS. 

Lactic Acid. The development of acid and curd occurs 
normally in milk on keeping It is due to the formation 
of lactic acid from the milk sugar or lactose, by the action 
of enzymes produced by microbic growth. Many species 
of bacteria are able to produce the lactic fermentation, but 
in milk those most commonly causing it are : (i) Bacillus 



374 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

lactis aerogenes, and (2) Streptococcus lacticus (Kruse), 
identical with theB. acidi lactici (Leichmann). Heinemann, 
who has investigated the subject, states that the two 
species are ordinarily present in naturally souring milk, 
the former in abundance at the beginning, the latter 
in the later stages when the acidity has reached a high 
degree. The secret of the regularity of the presence of 
these two species is their power of withstanding a much 
higher degree of acidity than the other species present at 
the first. In changing to lactic acid, the lactose is believed 
to be first hydrolyzed into glucose and galactose. 

C j 2 H 2 2 O j j + H 2 O = C 6 H j 2 O 6 + C 6 H 1 2 O 6 = 46 3 H 6 O 3 

Coagulation of casein follows on acidification of the 
milk, the amount of acid necessary to precipitate the 
casein averaging 0-45 per cent ; the terminal amount may 
reach 0-85 per cent. The casein precipitated by lactic 
acid formation is never redissolved, because the high 
acidity inhibits the proteolytic ferments. 

Casein precipitation, however, may also be due to a non- 
acid coagulation caused by bacterial ferments. Casein 
precipitated in this way may be redissolved by a bacterial 
trypsin or cas'ease, produced by the same or other bacteria, 
and the milk hence may become entirely liquid, transparent, 
and of a yellowish colour. 

B. bulgaricus in milk culture produces 2-5 per cent of 
lactic acid, and 0-05 per cent of acetic and succinic acids, 
is non-pathogenic, and exerts no putrefactive action upon 
proteids. Metchnikoff suggested its use in milk cultures 
as a food to inhibit, by its acid production, the growth in 
the intestine of the class of bacteria which break up 
proteids, the bacteria of putrefaction. This is Metchnikoff 's 
bacteriotherapy, which has been extensively practised. 

B. bulgaricus is a large, non-motile, non-sporing, Gram- 
positive bacillus, with square ends (like B. anthracis). It 
forms short and long chains. It shows little or no growth 
on ordinary media or below 37 C. Optimum temperature : 
42 C. Grows in dextrose-peptone broth, to which calcium 
carbonate has been added. 

Butyric Acid fermentation of milk occurs occasionally 
in milk from the growth of anaerobic bacteria. It is a 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 375 

much slower process than the lactic one, and can also be 
produced by some pathogenic anaerobes, e.g., bacilli 
of quarter-evil, malignant redema, B. Welchii and B. 
enteritidis sporogenes (Klein). 

Alcoholic Fermentation of milk occurs spontaneously 
on rare occasions. The process is due to the natural in- 
troduction of yeasts, and once started can be kept going 
by infecting fresh milk. Koumiss is thus made by the 
Tartars from mare's milk. Kefir is an effervescent sour 
milk made from cow's milk by the addition of " kefir 
grains," little cauliflower-like excrescences whose fermen- 
tative power is due to Saccharomyces mycoderma. Mare's 
milk is more suitable for the preparation, because the 
lactic fermentation also accompanies the other, and the 
duration of the double fermentation is conditioned by the 
amount of sugar, which is 5-5 per cent in mare's milk and 
4-8 per cent in cow's. The latter is richer in casein and fat, 
and both of these constitute disadvantages, so that it is 
usually diluted in making koumiss. In the making, the 
milk is stirred constantly by day but rested at night. The 
amount of alcohol in all these products koumiss, kefir, and 
cow's milk koumiss is under 2 per cent, and the Tartar is 
capable of consuming three to four gallons of such milk 
on a hot summer's day without becoming more than 
hilarious, and with no digestive disturbance. They have 
been much used as " consumption cures." 

DISEASES OF MILK. 

Unusual or abnormal changes in milk are sometimes 
referred to as " diseases." They are produced by bacteria 
which have got into milk in various ways. Blue, green, 
and yellow milks are due respectively to the bacilli cyano- 
genes, erythrogenes, and synxanthus ; and red milk to 
B. prodigiosus. Bitter milk is due to a number of 
species, yeasts and diplococci having been isolated. 
Slimy or ropy milk has been traced to B. lactis viscosus, 
said to be a water organism. Slimy milk is produced 
at Edam (Holland) by the use of a streptococcus, for 
the manufacture of Edam cheese. Soapy milk is due to a 
micrococcus derived from fodder. 



376 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 
BUTTER. 

Butter is made from the cream of milk by churning or 
agitation, whereby the globules of fat are broken, or 
rather have their casein envelopes ruptured, and then the 
fat globules adhere. The cream is first allowed to sour, 
otherwise the butter will be flavourless. The souring 
isjbrought about by bacteria, nearly all of which are lactic 
acid formers. Tuberculosis is the only infective disease 
transmitted by butter. Tubercle bacilli have been found 
alive and virulent in butter after having been kept in a 
refrigerator for five months. Rabinowitch's acid-fast butter 
bacillus is easily distinguished culturally from the tubercle 
bacillus. Foot and mouth disease has been reported as 
having been transmitted by butter. Typhoid infection 
is unlikely, and has not yet been definitely traced. 

CHEESE. 

Cheese is the precipitated casein of milk, the casein 
or curd being insoluble. In hard cheeses the whey is 
better expressed than in soft cheeses, and so the sub- 
sequent " ripening " which is due to bacterial growth is 
less in the former than in the latter. In the ripening of the 
curd, three groups of bacteria are engaged, (i) acid pro- 
ducers, like B. acidi lactici, (2) casein digesters, which break 
down the curd, and (3) gas producers, which honeycomb it. 
The actual organisms engaged have been determined in the 
case of particular cheeses, and are : a bacillus resembling 
the Bacillus subtilis, a mould (Oidium lactis), a penicillium 
mould, and yeasts. Tubercle bacilli of the bovine and 
human types have been found in cheeses.

DISINFECTANTS. 

A disinfectant or germicide is a substance which destroys 
the microbic causes of disease. The same substance 
in a weaker strength may act as an antiseptic, that is an 
agent which restrains or checks the growth of bacteria 
without destroying them. A deodorant is a substance 
which destroys or masks the offensive effluvia or vapours 
resulting from bacterial growth, and may or may not 
have an action on the bacteria themselves. The best 
example of an agent capable of all these functions is 
potassium permanganate, which in strengths of 5 per cent 
and over is a disinfectant, under 5 per cent is an anti- 
septic, and in all strengths is a deodorant. (Solubility, 
1-18 of water ; 1-3 boiling.) The mode of action of 
disinfectants varies. Some, like the strong acids, char or 
carbonize the bacterial body by oxidizing the other 
elements present. Others coagulate the bacterial proto- 
plasm ; while some, diffusing through the cell wall, exert 
a poisonous action on the protoplasm. Antiseptics like 
sugar, probably act by osmotic pressure through the cell 
wall, causing a flow of water out of the cell, thus drying 
up the protoplasm and rendering the bacterium inert for 
the time being. 

The chief disinfectants are the metallic salts, acids 
bases, the halogen elements, oxidizing agents, alcohols 
phenols, aldehydes, and the essential oils. The salts, 
acids, and bases act best in watery solution as against 
alcoholic solutions. Two explanations of this are offered : 

(1) That the salts, etc., in water dissociate into their ions, 
and the latter are more active in producing chemical 
change ; in alcohols, dissociation does not take place. 

(2) That the alcohol hinders the action of the disinfectant 
by hardening the bacterial cell wall. In favour of the 
second reason it has been noted that while absolute 
alcohol is useless as a germicide, added to aqueous mercuric 
chloride solution in the proportion of 25 per cent it increases 
the efficiency of the disinfectant. The addition of NaCl, 
on the other hand, diminishes the efficiency, it is believed 
by reducing the number of free ions. 

The halogens (Cl, Br, I) are efficient in the order given. 
Chloride of lime liberates free Cl when treated with an 



378 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

acid. When used simply in solution, oxygen is liberated 
in the nascent state, and oxidizes any organic matter 
present (CaOCl 2 + H 2 O = CaO + 2HC1 + O). Peroxide 
of hydrogen and potassium ' permanganate act similarly 
as oxidizers. 

Carbolic acid (phenol) and the cresols (lysol and creolin) 
do not dissociate, and their efficiency is increased by the 
addition of NaCl and diminished by alcohol. Formalde- 
hyde is not helped by adding salt, but alcohol is harmful. 

Standardization. The efficiency of any disinfectant 
depends on many factors, namely, the strength used, the 
solvent, the temperature, the bacterium to which applied, 
the time allowed for action, the other substances present, 
the number of bacteria present. For practical purposes 
the strengths are expressed as percentages ; but in com- 
parisons it is more scientific to work with solutions of 
the molecular weight or multiples thereof in one litre. 

Coefficient of Inhibition. This term is applied 
to the strength (of a chemical substance) which is able to 
prevent the growth of a micro-organism ; that is, its 
antiseptic value. 

It is determined by making broths or other media 
containing the chemical substance to be tested, in a range 
of strengths. Equal quantities of the bacterium used in 
the test are inoculated into the various tubes (say, one 
loopful), the contents mixed, and incubated. In the 
case of solid media, they are poured into plates and the 
colonies (if any) counted. In broth cultures, look for 
turbidity, and confirm positive or negative results by 
making films. The coefficient is expressed in terms of 
strength and bacterium used. Thus, carbolic acid is 
said to inhibit the growth of anthrax bacilli when present 
in a strength of I part in 800 of medium. B. typhosus 
requires 1-400, and Sp. cholerae, 1-600. Of corrosive 
sublimate, 1-100,000 inhibits B. anthracis, and 1-60,000 
inhibits B. typhosus. 

Germicidal, Bactericidal, or Disinfectant Strengths. 
Koch used anthrax spores dried on silk threads, which 
he immersed in various strengths of substance being 
tested, at a definite temperature and for varying times. 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 379 

The threads were then removed and carefully washed in 
sterile water to discharge the disinfectant. They were 
then laid on gelatin and incubated, and the result 
was noted. This method is faulty, in that it is difficult 
to remove the disinfectant, some of which clinging to the 
bacteria inhibits growth. The Rideal-Walker method 
may be applied here to determine germicidal strength 
without comparison with carbolic acid. 

The results are stated in terms of strength used, time 
exposed, and bacterium killed : thus carbolic acid is 
bactericidal to anthrax spores at ordinary temperatures 
in 1-20 dilution in four to forty-five days ; at 4OC., in 
three hours. 

To Sp. cholerae at ordinary temperatures, 1-200 is 
fatal in five minutes, and 1-300 is fatal in two to 
twenty-four hours. 

To B. typhosus at ordinary temperatures, 1-50 is fatal 
in five minutes. 

To staphylococci and streptococci at ordinary tempera- 
tures, 1-60 is fatal in five minutes. 

Corrosive sublimate is fatal to anthrax spores in 
1-2000 in twenty-six hours. 

To anthrax and typhoid bacilli and Sp. cholerae, in 
1-2000 in five minutes. 

To staphylococci and streptoccoci, 1-10,000 to 1-2000 
in five minutes. 

These tests supply useful data, but cannot be taken as 
applying to the action of the same disinfectants, when 
mixed with the body fluids. 

Rideal-Walker Test. In this test carbolic acid is 
taken as the standard disinfectant, and the results of tests 
of other disinfectants are expressed in terms of their power, 
compared to the standard, of inhibiting growth of the same 
organism in the same time. This is called the " carbolic 
acid coefficient " of the particular disinfectant. 

PROCESS. A series of accurate dilutions of pure carbolic 
acid and of the disinfectant are prepared in sterile distilled 
water. A twenty-four hours' culture at 37 C. in Lemco 
broth (reaction + i'5) of B. typhosus is used as the test 
organism. A standard size of platinum loop is used to 
make the subcultures. The disinfectant solutions are 



380 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

arranged in a series of tubes, each containing 5 c.c., and 
the dilution of the disinfectant is marked on each tube. 

To 5 c.c. of a particular dilution, five drops of the filtered 
culture are added ; the tube is shaken and set down. 
Now repeat with the next dilution, and so on. At the 
end of 2-5 minutes, a subculture is made from the tube 
first inoculated, into 5 c.c. of sterile broth, and similarly 
with all the dilutions, in the proper order. At the end of 
5, 7-5. 10, 12-5, and 15 minutes, put up further subcultures 
thus, making six series of subcultures in all from each tube. 
The same process is carried out, at the same time, with the 
same culture, with dilutions of carbolic acid. All the sub- 
cultures are incubated for at least forty-eight hours at 
37 C., and the presence or absence of growth is noted. 
From the table of results, the two dilutions doing the same 
work in the same time are seen. Say that 1-500 of Disin- 
fectant A inhibited growth in 2-5, 5, 7-5 minutes' exposures, 
and that carbolic acid i-no did the same ; then the 
carbolic acid coefficient of Disinfectant A is 500 -MIO = 4-5. 

Since its introduction this test has been much used. It 
has also been subjected to much criticism. It deals with 
" naked " bacteria. The other objections are that it must 
be carefully done, all the dilutions should be accurate, the 
organism used should be the same throughout, etc. These 
are not indictments of the test in careful hands, and where 
the tests on different disinfectants are made by the same 
individual. Still the results obtained by this test should 
not be taken for more than they pretend to be, the relative 
power of different bodies to carbolic acid under the same 
conditions. The application of such results to ordinary 
purposes must be made very cautiously. 

The "Lancet" Commission Test. This is a modified 
Rideal-Walker test, in which the number of dilutions is 
increased up to nine, and the time periods correspondingly 
up to thirty minutes ; B. coli is used as the test organism ; 
MacConkey's bile-salt litmus glucose peptone water is used 
as the medium for subcultures instead of broth ; platinum 
spoons are used instead of loops, and the method of calcula- 
tion is different. 

The B. coli used is cultivated for twenty-four hours at 



381 

37 C. in a broth made by mincing i Ib. of fat -free bullock's- 
heart meat ; macerate it in cold water for two to three 
hours ; cook over a small gas flame for two to three 
hours more ; boil ; filter ; make up to a litre ; add 10 grm. 
each of NaCl and Witte's peptones ; and standardize to an 
acidity of 1-5 per cent to phenolphthalein. To obtain an 
emulsion from the culture, it is well shaken and then 
filtered through a double layer of Swedish filter-paper. 
The carbolic acid dilutions were made at first by taking 
ac. carbolic B.P. no grm. = 100 grm. pure phenol. Later, 
dry crystalline carbolic acid was taken as 100 per cent 
phenol. The dilutions were always freshly made, as it was 
found that otherwise they lost some of their germicidal 
power, even when kept corked and in the dark. The dis- 
infectant dilutions are made with distilled sterile water, and 
5 c.c. of each are put in small glass specimen pots, 2-5 in. 
X ^ in., arranged in holes on a board. These pots are 
left uncovered during the experiment, and the results are 
not vitiated owing to the MacConkey's media used for the 
subculturing, inhibiting most other organisms than B. coli. 
Owing to the platinum spoon holding three times the 
amount in a standard loopful, 10 c.c. are used for the 
subculture medium. To assist in rapid work a special 
wheel has been devised, to hold the spoons, when not in 
use, in a sterilizing flame. 

PROCESS. All the apparatus being ready and to hand, 
the dilutions of the unknown disinfectant are " seeded," 
each getting a spoonful of the B. coli emulsion, and being 
well stirred. The seeding is begun at the strongest 
dilution and proceeds to the weakest. At the end of 
2-5 minutes, a spoonful is removed from the first dilution 
seeded and added to a tubeful (10 c.c.) of MacConkey's 
broth, properly labelled. The same process is repeated 
with all the tubes, and is all gone over again after 5, 7-5, 
10, 12-5, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes. 

The same procedure is followed with dilutions of carbolic 
acid. 

The subcultures are incubated for forty-eight hours at 
37 C. A positive result is indicated by the medium 
turning red, and the formation of bubbles of gas. In 
some tubes this change will appear in twelve to fourteen 



382 PUBLIC HEALTH BACTERIOLOGY 

hours as a purple tinge, becoming pink and then red in 
another two hours. The results are rilled into a tabular 
form, with a plus sign for growth and a zero for no growth. 
The coefficient is thus calculated : The weakest dilution 
of the sample under test, giving no growth at 2-5 minutes, 
is divided by the weakest dilution of carbolic acting 
similarly in the same time ; the weakest dilution giving 
no growth at thirty minutes is divided by the same for 
carbolic acid ; the two results are averaged, and the 
average or mean is taken as the carbolic acid coefficient. 
Thus, if Disinfectant B gives no growth with 1-220 in 
2-5 minutes and with 1-340 in 30 minutes, and if the 
dilutions for carbolic acid are i-no and 1-180, then 
the coefficient would be : 

(m + m) - 2 or (2 + 1-88) - 2 = 1-94. 

The Commission prefer to express their dilutions as 
percentages, and when this is done the mode of division 
is reversed ; that is, the weakest percentage (of carbolic, etc.) 
is divided by the weakest percentage of the test substance, 
etc. The above dilutions become for B, 0-454 per cent 
and 0-294 per cent, and for carbolic, 0-909 per cent and 
0-555 P er cent respectively. The coefficient therefore is 
(* : W + 5 ) - 2 or (2 + 1-85) ^ 2 = 1-92. The tem- 
perature of the room averaged about 62 to 67 F. 

By this method the coefficients ranged from 0-025 to 
9-8 for the usual coal-tar disinfectants on the market. 
Applied to corrosive sublimate, the coefficient at 2-5 
minutes was about 2000, and at 30 minutes about 6000, 
giving a mean of about 4000. Chloride of lime similarly 
gave figures of 45 and 93, or a mean of 69. For formalin 
the coefficient was 0-6. 

Among the conclusions reached were the following : 
That results obtained in such bacteriological experiments, 
although giving a germicidal value to a disinfectant under 
the most favourable conditions, afford little indication of 
their germicidal value when used in practical disinfection. 
That much remains to be done in the solution of such 
problems (amongst others) as arise, due to : (i) The 
presence of foreign substances in the material to be dis- 
infected ; (2) The temperature at which the disinfecting 



SPECIAL EXAMINATIONS 383 

process is carried on ; (3) The kind of water used for 
dilution hard water, soft water, or sea water ; (4) The 
type of micro-organism that has to be dealt with ; (5) The 
nature of the substance to be disinfected and the character 
of its surface ; (6) The time to be allowed for the process. 
That only when the influence of such factors can be 
calculated will it be possible to modify any standard co- 
efficient figure, and thus to obtain data for the preparation 
of effective and economical dilutions for the practical 
problem of disinfection. 

The inquiry has shown that, so far as emulsions are 
concerned, those which contain the highest quantity of 
phenoloids in the finest state of division and having the 
least tendency to combine with albumins, lime, or other 
foreign substances in solution (and remain combined), will 
be found to be the most efficient disinfectants. 

The remarkable parallelism between the results of this 
inquiry (as shown in the figures for the coefficient) and the 
results of the independent chemical one, is very striking. 
The chemical commissioners discovered that if they 
subtracted the carbolic acid equivalent of the bromine 
absorbed by the percentage of phenoloids present, from 
the percentage of phenoloids present, and divided the 
difference by 3, the figures obtained in many instances 
are the same (or very nearly so) as those assigned as the 
carbolic acid co-efficient for the same substance by the 
bacteriological commissioners. In the exceptions the dis- 
infecting fluids did not form an emulsion with water, nor 
show Brownian movements. (See p. 142.)

APPENDIX. 

REGULATIONS FOR THE DIPLOMA IN 
PUBLIC HEALTH. 

I. The Council, having regard to the terms of Section 18 
of the Local Government Act (1888) and of Section 54 of the 
Local Government (Scotland) Act (1889), and observing that 
under those sections special privilege is to be accorded to the 
holders of the diplomas granted under Section 21 of the 
Medical Act (1886), and therein described as Diplomas in 
Sanitary Science, Public Health, or State Medicine, thinks it 
essential to declare, with regard to its own future action 
under Section 21 of the Medical Act (1886), that it will not 
consider diplomas to " deserve recognition in the Medical 
Register " unless they have been granted under such conditions 
of education and examination as to ensure (in the judgment ot 
the Council) the possession of a distinctively high proficiency, 
scientific and practical, in all the branches of study which

PRESERVATIVES IN MILK AND CREAM. 

The Local Government Board, England, in February, 1912, 
in the exercise of its powers under the Public Health Acts, 
drafted regulations prohibiting the use of preservatives in 
milk and defining the conditions under which preservatives 
may be used in cream. 

PRESERVATIVES IN MILK. 

Article III. : " i. No person shall add, or order or permit 
any other person to add, any preservative substance to milk 
intended for sale for human consumption. 2. No person 
shall sell, or expose or offer for sale, or have in his possession 
for the purpose of sale, any milk to which any preservative 
substance has been added in contravention of subdivision (i) 
of this article." The expression " milk " includes separated, 
skimmed, condensed, and dried milk ; but as the traffic in 
condensed milk would be seriously impeded if the use of 
sugar were disallowed, it is provided that " neither cane nor 
beet sugar shall be regarded as a preservative or a thickening 
substance." 

PRESERVATIVES IN CREAM. 

" i. No person shall add, or order or permit any other person 
to add, (a) any thickening substance to cream or preserved 
cream ; (b) any preservative substance to cream containing 
less than 40 per cent by weight of milk fat ; (c) to cream 
containing 40 per cent or more by weight of milk fat any 
preservative substance other than (i.) boric acid, borax, or a 
mixture of these preservative substances, or (ii.) hydrogen 
peroxide, in amount not exceeding o-i per cent by weight, 
in any case in which the cream is intended for sale for human 
consumption. 2. No person shall sell, or expose or offer for 
sale, or have in his possession for the purpose of sale, any 
cream to which any thickening substance or any preservative 
substance has been added in contravention of the provisions 
of subdivision (i) of this article." Every seller of preserved 
cream will be required in every invoice, bill, advertisement, 
trade list, or other document which is used in connection with 
the sale of preserved cream, to describe the article as (a) pre- 
served cream (boracised), or (b) preserved cream (peroxidised), 
as the case may be. (This provision will come into force on 



APPENDIX 389 

January i, 1913.) Dealers in cream, preserved in a manner 
which does not contravene the above regulation, will be 
required, by means of labels on the receptacles, to declare 
that the cream is preserved and to state the name of the 
preservative. In this matter the regulations are precise, 
laying down in a schedule the size of the label, which varies 
according to the capacity of the receptacle, and prohibiting 
the attachment to any receptacle of a label bearing a trade 
description which would be likely to mislead a purchaser as 
to the utility of the preservative substance. In tea shops 
and other refreshment rooms the cream jugs will not be 
required to be labelled if in each room a conspicuous notice is 
affixed indicating that the cieam supplied is preserved cream, 
or if a statement to that effect is printed on the bills of fare. 
The regulations are made under the Public Health (Regulations 
as to Food) Act, 1907, and any person who wilfully neglects to 
carry out the regulations is liable to a penalty not exceeding 
^100, and in the case of a continuing offence to a furthei 
penalty not exceeding 50 for every day during which the 
offence continues. The penalties for offences against the 
regulations are those for which provision is made by Jfub- 
section (3) of Section i of the Public Health Act, 1896, but 
before the local authority institutes proceedings against any 
person they will be required to afford him an opportunity of 
explaining the circumstances in which any irregularity may 
have occurred. With the exception of the provision relating 
to the labelling of preserved cream, which takes effect on Jan. 
ist, 1913, the regulations take effect from June ist, 1912.

BOVINE AND HUMAN TYPES OF 
TUBERCLE BACILLI.* 

i. SMITH REACTION. 

Theobald Smith, in 1896, first drew attention to the 
existence of two types oi tubercle bacilli in mammals, and in 
1898 he published a systematic comparative study of bacilli 
isolated from man and cattle, and pointed out the differences 
between the two types as summarised on page 277. Pursuing 
the research further, he found that when grown in slightly 
acid glycerin broth, the two types give different reaction 
curves. 

Glycerin Broth. The human type caused at first a lessening 
of the acidity of the medium until it became nearly but not 
quite neutral ; thereafter the acidity increased until it again 
approached or slightly exceeded the original reaction. 

The bovine type in the early stages of its growth rendered 
the medium less acid, neutral, or even alkaline ; and then it 
may so remain or become acid again, but never up to the 
original degree. 

The British Royal Commission for this test also used 
glycerin litmus milk (milk freed from cream, plus 5 per cent 
of glycerin, plus 5 per cent of 5 per cent watery solution of 
Merck's purified litmus). They found that all human viruses 
which grew vigorously on this medium at first caused an 
increase of alkalinity, and later acidity and clotting ; if the 
growth was less vigorous, acidity resulted without clotting. 
The bovine viruses which grew vigorously in the medium 
caused acidity finally, but never clotted the milk ; the poorly 
growing viruses left the milk alkaline. They concluded that 
the reaction curves can be so grouped as to form a scale of 
the final reactions with complete gradations from one type 
to the other. 

2. CULTURAL CHARACTERS (p. 15). 

The results of our work have led to the conclusion that 
there is no constant qualitative cultural difference between

Laboratory, Department of Health, City of New York, 1910," by Park and 
Krumwiede, and others. 



APPENDIX 391 

the human and bovine types of tubercle bacilli. Quantita- 
tively, and with respect to the effect of glycerin, however, 
there is a marked difference in the great majority of cultures, 
so great in fact that almost without exception the type can 
be determined from cultures alone. This difference is constant 
in one factor only, viz., amount and rapidity of growth in 
early cultures. In classifying our cultures according to this 
characteristic, we can broadly say that all bovine types of 
bacilli are dysgonic (sparse growth) and all human types of 
bacilli are eugonic (moderate or luxuriant growth). The 
question remains, What is the best medium for eliciting this 
difference ? Any medium used must fulfil certain conditions. 

1. It must be especially adapted for the growth of the 
eugonic viruses, so that the best possible growth is obtained. 

2. It would be preferable if the growth of the dysgonic 
virus were somewhat retarded on the medium. This will 
widen the gap as far as possible. 

3. The medium must be nearly uniform in its results ; that 
is, growth should not fluctuate with the different batches of 
medium used. 

We have found that glycerin egg is by far the best medium 
for this purpose. . . . Cobbett (Royal Commission) made 
comparisons of the two types of organisms on both serum and 
glycerin serum. While the human cultures were far more 
vigorous with the use of glycerin serum, the bovine cultures 
were either restrained, or if aided by its presence, the increase 
in growth was slight. This difference he found in early 
cultures to be of diagnostic value in the separation of the 
two types. We also noticed that primary cultures of the 
bovine type repeatedly failed on glycerin egg, whereas the 
primary cultures of the human type were usually markedly 
increased in luxuriance. The reading of Cobbett's results 
led us to adopt glycerin egg as the basic differential medium. 

Giving then the results in terms of glycerin, the following 
general conclusions may be drawn. 

(a). All cultures* growing luxuriantly on glycerin egg from 
the start are of the human type. 

(6). All cultures* growing sparsely, or even not at all, on 

* No direct cultures were attempted. Guinea-pigs were inoculated and 
killed in three to five weeks, and inoculations made from tuberculous 
lymph nodes and spleen on to plain egg media (Dorset), glycerin egg 
media (Lubenau), and glycerin potato. Intravenous inoculation into 
rabbits was used in confirmation of type of culture. If rabbit survived 
injection of i mgr. of culture for 60 days, then human type.

4. CONCLUSIONS (Park and Krurmviede) loc. cit. p. 134. 

Tubercle bacilli as isolated from man fall into two groups. 
One of these groups is identical in all its characters with that 
found in cattle. That is, all tubercle bacilli from man and 
cattle fall into two groups, which have been designated the 
human and bovine types. 

Each type shows certain differences, the most important 
for separation being those culturally and in virulence. The 
great majority of cultures group themselves around two 
extremes, from which there are a few cultures showing variant 
characteristics. There is no overlapping of characteristics. 
The two types are probably different because of residence in 
different hosts over long periods of time, and as such are 
stable. The evidence in favour of rapid change of type is 
incomplete and inconclusive. 



* Includes i double infection : Mesenteric nodes gave human type, 
meningeal fluid gave bovine type.
