OUK EEOIPES. 

Practical experience has shown us that 
recipes from cook-books are not always 
reliable, and generally expensive in spices, 
eggs, etc. From a large number of books 
we have used, we are satisfied that they are 
simply copied from one to another. The 
practice is a foolish one. Our experienced 
editress of that department does not allow a 
recipe inserted, unless tried by her at home, 
and the ones printed here are those used by 
her for a long time, many of them thirty 
years. Her experience is worth much more 
than all the cook-books printed. This year 
we shall publish Two Thousand Cooking 
Recipes, which, in a 'book, would cost tioo 
dollars. We shall also publish Fifteen 
Hundred Practical Recipes and reasons why, 
worth in books four dollars ; with much 
other useful information. We will guar- 
antee THAT A family WHO HAS OUK MAG- 
AZINE WILL SAVE, IN EGGS ALONE, TEN 

TIMES THE PKiCE OP IT. In many recipes 



where five eggs are used, she uses one, giv- 
ing a cheap substitute for the other four. 
Again, by practice she has found it a fact 
that one good spice is better than five or more 
kinds, as ordered by cook-books. More reci- 
pes will appear every quarter, as well as 
how to purchase and use the cheaper articles 
of food. Besides Mks. Winslow's Econom- 
ical Recipes, we shall publish French, 
English, German, and other Styles of 
Cooking. These will be given in the other 
numbers. Many of them are quite novel, and 
worthy of a trial. We shall also give new 
American recipes as fast as they are invented. 
This is an age of progress, and families 
must be informed of any thing practical, 
good, and cheap in that costliest department 
— the kitchen. 



ANTI-BURNING 

TEA-KETTLE BOILER. 

This new invention is one that every per- 
son who cooks, or loves good cooking, will 
at once appreciate. It is well known that 
many articles of food are very easily burnt 
in cooking, especially those of the more 
delicate nature. To obviate this difBculty, 
double boilers are sometimes used, but they 
are twice as expensive, and the food is almost 
as apt to be spoiled as it would be in a 
stewpan. The inventor lost so many of 
them by their being burnt out (as the water 
is soon boiled away), that necessity caused 
the Tea-Kettle Boiler to be invented. 
Of course every family use a tea-kettle for 
boiling water. This we use as our water- 
bath, or first kettle. The Berney boiler is 
so made as to fit into any tea-kettle per- 
fectly tight. As it is made of tin, it can be 
kept clean easily. It has a handle, cover, 
and oval spout ; holds from two to five 
quarts. For boiling Milk, cooking Corn 
Starch, Maizena, Farina, Hominy, Grits, 
Samp, Rice, Oysters, Jellies, Cocoanut, 
and, in fact, any such food, it is superior to 
all other cooking utensils now in use. They 
will measure liquids, flour, etc. Try one. 
Price, 75 cents to $1.50, according to the 
size. Read the recipes for cookiug with it. 
For sale in all the hardware, tinware, and 
house-furnishing stores. 



PKESEEVE THE MYSTEKT TOE 
BINDING. 

It will make a large and useful volume at 
the end of the year. A daily newspaper 
costs four cents a day, over twelve dollars a 
year, and at the end of the year you have 
not one. The Mystery costs you one 
dollar, and fifty cents for binding, and is 
worth ten dollars at the end of a year. 
Why ? Because it is useful, and every day 
will save you money. 



RULES FOR TRADING. 



EULES FOR TEADING- ECONOMICALLY. 



Having been left a widow, with eiglit 
ctuldren to support, in 1837, I had to study 
economy. My husband had been a whole- 
sale grocer and dealer in provisions, but the 
failures of 1837 took both his fortune and 
his life 

His creditors sold every thing, houses, 
store, furniture, all, and left me in the 
streets in February 1838, with the snow 
three feet deep (there was no exemption law 
then). With the help of a few relatives my 
family was cared for, though scattered here 
and there , after a time I again gathered 
them together, resolved that they should not 
leave me, except of their own desire ; each 
one that was able now put all their earnings 
in the household purse. With nine to feed 
and clothe, and rent to pay, with the nu- 
merous calls for money, it became a duty 
and a study how to buy the cheapest, yet 
good articles. 

I BOUGHT FOR CASH, AND EVERY THING 
WHOLESALE except a few unimportant and 
perishable things. In order to have the 
means to do that, we were very prudent 
until enough money had been saved to buy 
two articles — a bushel of meal and a barrel 
of flour. After that it was comparatively 
easy to buy ; for the thirty, and sometimes 
sixty and one hundred per cent, was saved 
to us. TJie advantages of buying wholesale 
are, — you have the goods in the original 
package ; you are sure of full weight ; you 
get them pure and imiform. The fine cuts 
of meat are generally very expensive, now 
from twenty-five to thirty-five cents per 
pound ; but the head, feet, heart, liver, tripe, 
and coarser parts are equally as good if 
cooked properly, and give a greater variety. 
Vegetables are good, but not so important, 
except potatoes. Many of those now de- 
pendent upon the corner grocer and butcher, 
who give a very limited credit at exhorbi- 
tant profits, and the customers are forced to 
buy just what they have, if they would be- 
gin and save enough to buy one article 
wholesale, they would soon buy all. Why 
should the poor man labor hard all the 
week, that when Saturday night comes he 
must give one-third of his earnings as profit 
to the retailer, who lives an easy life, and 
gets rich ofl" of this trade ? I give you many 
recipes for each article, and if you have 
nothing in the house but meal, you can 
make a comfortable repast, at least not hun- 
ger. 

Many would buy largely, they say, but 
what can we do with it ; it would spoil. I 
will show you, wives and mothers ; recollect 
that the husband who has toiled all day for 



you and the children, expects you to save, 
and also to provide him with well-cooked 
food. How gratified he will be on his re- 
turn home to find some new, healthy, palat 
able dish, made out of that bushel of meal 
that he bought at only three cents a pound ; 
or a nice hash made from yesterday's cold 
mutton or heart. And when he knows that 
the food costs him one-third less, sometimes 
one half, it is an incentive to him to work 
longer, to get a roof over your heads that 
can be all your own. 

In buying WHOLESALE SO as to have 
the benefit of the market, I will give a list 
of pounds and gallons you must buy, for if 
you go where they sell less, they will charge 
retaU prices. 

There has been much said about co-opera- 
tive societies and companies. I know of no 
better company than a large family, or even 
a small one ; or if one, two, or more club 
together, make out a list, and send one to 
buy, and then divide, they will have them 
by the retail at wholesale prices. Try it 
once and you will continue : I have for over 
twenty years alone, and the saving and 
comfort is untold. The loss of time of run 
ning to the store, the uncertainty of the 
quality of the articles, and many times the 
inferiority, totally disappoint the cook. 

A friend of mine traded at a fine grocery 
store. Among the items of his monthly bill 
was cream of tartar, at one dollar and 
twenty cents a pound. Thinking cream of 
tartar had risen, he called upon a wholesale 
druggist to inquire the price ; he was asked 
whether druggists' or grocers' ; he answered. 
What is the difference? Why, said the drug- 
gist, one is pure, the other adulterated ; 
grocers' is thirty cents a pound, druggists' 
fifty-five cents per pound. He took ten 
pounds, costing $5.50, saving $6.50 ; then 
having it pure, twenty-five cents a pound 
made $2.50 more; saving altogether nine 
dollars upon ten pounds. He bought ten 
pounds of soda at ten cents, saved one dol- 
lar upon that. He took them home, his 
cook was cautioned not to use but half so 
much of the tartar, and did not, but the 
bread was as good as ever. This is a fact, 
and explains the whole subject. 

As TO Saving and Purity. — There 
are several articles upon which the sav- 
ing is very large ; tea, molasses, syrup, 
oil, tartar, soda, and in fact all. Tea is 
rarely found pure except bought of a respon- 
sible house : oil will explode if not made as 
it ought to be. But my space will not 
allow me to go on as I wish I could, and I 
refer you to the table and cards of those 



RULES FOR TRADING. 



who will sell you pure, and as low as can be 
bought in New York. Of course, in tea and 
a few things, the quality makes a difference 
in the price. I give the lowest amount that 
can be bought at the wholesale prices, most 
of which are in the original packages. Go

In buying wholesale you will save 

Health, because you have pure articles. 

Patience, because you have them home 
and uniform. 

Time, because you can buy six months' 
supply at once. 

Money, because you can buy as cheap as 
the retailer, you can save as a general thing, 
one-quarter to one-third of your money on 
an average. 

In the selection of goods you will 
have but little trouble, for you will deal 
with men of honor and principle as a gen- 
eral thing, who do a large business and are 
above misrepresentation. There are also 
certain brands that are the best, and you 
will soon find them out, and will use no 
other. 

Provisions. — Buy sweet salt butter to 
keep, pure lard, sweet hams, and cheese to 
taste. 

Sugars. — We use only granulated, for it 
is the cheapest in the end ; no drying up, 
no waste, and it is impossible to adulterate 
it. Twenty years' use of it only strengthens 
us in our belief. 

Coffee. — Buy it green, roast it home. 
Rio and Java, two-thirds Java, one-third Rio, 
is best ; use only piire coffee. 

Tea. — Buy black or Japan ; green is not 
so good Grocers make large profits on tea. 

Soap.— Always buy it long before you 
want to use it, and cut it up to dry. 

Starch. — All are generally good. 

Syrups and Molasses. — Buy a good 
tliick syrup or New Orleans molasses ; you 
will save fifty cents a gallon. 

Flours and Meals. — Go to a wholesale 
store, tell them what you want, and you will 
generally get it satisfactory. 

California flour I found very good. 

St. Louis and southern flour will make 
more bread than any other. Rye flour 
makes good cheap bread. 

Yellow meal is sweeter than white. 

Fruits and Vegetables. — Always buy 
them fresh, clean looking, and free from de- 
cay. As they vary in quality very much, 
good judgment is better than advice. 

Druggist's Articles. — Get the best al- 
ways, at first class wholesale drug stores 
who will sell pure goods when asked for — 
you must in these things rely upon their 
honor. 

Fish. — Fish should always be perfectly 
fresh when cooked. To select fresh ones 
observe the eyes, if they have a bright life- 
like appearance, the fish is fresh ; if on the 
contrary, the eyes are sunken and dark 
colored, and have lost their brilliancy, they 
are certainly stale. Some judge by the red- 



FRANKLIN'S MAXIMS. 



ness of tlie gills, but they are sometimes 
colored to deceive customers. Do not buy 
any more fresh fish than you want to use 
for the day (except in winter, then they will 
keep), but the fresher the better. 

Dry Salt Fish should be kept in the 
cellar ; kept cool they wiU last a year ; age 
does not hurt them. Pick sweet ones. 

Pickled Fish of all kinds keep good a 
year in a cool place. Keep them always 
under the pickle ; a brick or two will do 
that. They are handy to have in the house. 

In tTie selection of Salt Fish, go to first- 
class stores, and they will give you good 
articles. 

Meats, Poultby, Game, etc. — The finest 
grained beef is the best. The flesh is of a fine 
red, and the fat a light cream color, but not 
yellow ; the fat, too, is solid and firm. The 
lean of mutton should be of a red color, 
and the fat white. The skin of pork should 
be of a light color, and if young it is tender ; 
the fat should appear firm. A tender goose 
is known by taking hold of the wing and 
raising it ; if the skin tears easily, the 
goose is tender ; or if you can readily insert 
the head of a pin into the flesh, it is young. 
The same remarks will hold good with re- 
gard to ducks. Young chickens may be 
known by pressing the lower end of the 
breast bone ; if it yields readily to the pres- 
sure they are not old, for in aU animals the 
bones are cartilaginous when young. The 
breast should be broad and plump in all 
kinds of poultry, the feet pliable, and the 
toes easily broken when bent back. 

Meat will keep in winter a long time ; at 
any time you fear it will not keep, have a 
barrel or keg of salt pickle to put it in. 
Meat then can be used up without waste. 

In summer we need less fresh meat, and 
need not buy so much. Salt meats, fish, 
fruits, and vegetables are best. A good re- 
frigerator will keqp meat several days in 
summer. 



PEANKLIN'S MAXIMS. 

Benjamin Frankin, one of the greatest 
philosophers and practical men of any age, 
thus teaches the people the importance of 

FRUGAIilTY AND ECONOMY. 

A man may, if he knows not how to save 
as he gets, keep his nose all his life to the 
grindstone, and die not worth a groat at last. 
A fat kitchen makes a lean will, and 

Many estates are spent in getting, 

Since women for tea forsook spinning and knitting, 

And men for punch forsook hewing and splitting. 

If you would be wealthy, think of saving 
as well as of getting. The Indies have not 
made Spain rich, because her outgoes are 
greater than her incomes. 

Away then with yovir expensive follies, 



and you will not then have so much cause 
to complain of hard times, heavy taxes, and 
chargeable families. 

What maintains one vice would bring 
up two children. 

Tou may think perhaps that a little tea 
or superfluities now and then, diet a little 
more costly, clothes a little finer, and a little 
entertainment now and then, can be no great 
matter ; but remember, many a little makes 
a mickle. 

Beware of little expenses ! A small leak 
will sink a great ship, as Poor Richard says ; 
and again : Who dainties love shall beg- 
gars prove ; and moreover, Fools make 
feasts, and wise men eat them. 

Here you are all got together to this sale 
of fineries and nick-nacks. You call them 
goods ; but if you do not take care they will 
prove evils to some of you. You expect 
they will be sold cheap, and perhaps they 
may for less than they cost ; but if you have 
no occasion for them, they must be dear to 
you. 

Remember what Poor Richard says : Buy 
what thou hast no need of, and ere long 
thou shalt sell thy necessaries. 

And again : At a great pennyworth pause 
awhile. He means, perhaps, that the cheap- 
ness is apparent only, and not real ; or the 
bargain, by straitening thee in thy busi- 
ness, may do thee more harm than good ; 
for in another place he says, Many have 
been ruined by buying good pennyworths. 

Many, for the sake of finery on the back, 
have gone with a hvmgry stomach, and half 
starved their families. Silks and satins, 
scarlets and velvets, put out the kitchen fire, 
as Poor Richard says. These are not the 
necessaries of life : they can scarcely be 
called the conveniences ; and yet, only be- 
cause they look pretty, how many want to 
have them ! 

By these and other extravagances, the 
genteel are reduced to poverty, and forced 
to borrow of those whom they formerly 
despised, but who through industry and 
frugality have maintained their standing, in 
which case it appears plainly that, A plough- 
man on his legs is higher than a gentleman 
on his knees, as Poor Richard says. Per- 
haps they had a small estate left them- 
which they knew not the getting of; they 
think. It is day, and will never be night ; 
that a little to be spent out of so much is 
not worth minding ; but always taking out 
of the meal-bag, and never putting in, soon 
comes to the bottom, as Poor Richard says, 
and then. When the well is dry, they know 
the worth of water. 

But this they might have known before, 
if they had taken his advice. If you would 
know the value of money, go and try to 
borrow some ; for he that goes a borrowing, 
goes a sorrowing, as Poor Richard says ; and 
indeed, so does he that lends to such people, 
when he goes to get it again. 



COOKING RECIPES. 



ECONOMICAL COOKING EECIPES. 



•All persons who have used Cook-Book 
recipes know that they give information 
to cook only fine rich dishes. The very 
recipes dishearten a prudent housekeeper. 
How can it be otherwise when some recipes 
of a single small dish call for ten eggs (at 
five cents apiece as they are in winter) and 
ounces of dear spices and outlandish herbs 
and costly frmts V Mrs. Winslow having for 
forty years cooked for a large family of her 
own, and kept a fashionable boarding-house, 
now getting old, gives to the world the 
benefit of New England cooking, with 
French, English, German, Scotch, Irish, and 
other national recipes that have been used 
by her, improved and cheapened. 

Mrs. Winslow's struggle through life to 
support her children caused her to use many 
of the cheaper foods, and her great love for 
her offspring caused the old lady to make 
them good and palatable, but at the same 
time healthy. It is well known that many, 
very many families, have nothing but dry 
bread the most of the time ; others have but 
little meat, others are tired of beef, pork, 
mutton, and lamb. They want something 
new ; all parties will find their wants sup- 
plied here ; many of her cheap dishes are as 
good as the much more costly ones of the 
modern cook-books. Many of the recipes 
can be cooked best in Mrs. Winslow's 
Tea-kettle Boiler, wliich saves time and 
waste. 

Where its use is indicated it will be in 
large type^, we will guarantee that any 
family will reduce their table expenses One- 

HALP BY THESE RECIPES, AND HAVE 
HEALTHIER AND BETTER DiSHES, BESIDES 
MANY NEW ONES THAT NEVER HAVE BEEN 

KNOWN TO THE PUBLIC. The families from 
Europe will recognize many of her dishes, 
and gladly welcome them. 

The great advantage of these recipes are 

Classification. 

1st. We classify the dishes iy the name of 
the principal food of which it is made, and 
keep them all together, so that one can see at 
a glance which one of that kind they prefer, 
and if they have only Indian corn meal in 
the house %vith the few things required, they 
can select from fifty dishes to suit their 
palate ; thus, bread, porridge, pudding, 
cakes, etc. 

Time. 

2d. The time is also seen at once ; the 
time it takes without reading the whole 
recipes, so that if the cook has not time to 
prepare it one way she can another, so that 



with meat of any kind it can be cooked to 
suit the time. 

Articles and Quantity. 
3d. The name of each article and the 
quantity are given separate, so that the cook, 
after having read the names and quantity, 
knows if she has the things, the amount, or 
can get them. If she can, she has but to 
read the 

4th, Directions, 
to go on. and then, if she desires to, can 
reduce the amovmt so as to make less, or 
increase and make more. Many times the 
spices, soda, cream of tartar, etc., are adul- 
terated, and it takes much more than the 
recipes say, for these are based upon pure 
goods. Our 

5th, Remarks 
upon dishes are to give information of their 
excellence, and whom they are best for, sick 
or well, with about the cost of them. We 
further add that our desire is to improve 
American cookery ; for, as persons who 
have traveled know, it can be very much 
improved. Many diseases are caused by bad 
cooking, and many more diseases originate 
by eating rich and unhealthy food. 

t. Milk 

Is a very common article of food, enters 
into a great many dishes, bread,- cake, pud- 
dings, pies, drinks ; it gives, like eggs, a rich 
flavor without being unhealthy. In large 
cities and towns it is apt to be adulterated 
with water ; to avoid which use Condensed 
Milk, which is sold in all large cities, or can 
be bought in tin cans of the grocers and drug- 
gists all over the country. It has many 
advantages over common milk. See Con- 
densed milk. 

2. Boiled Milk. 

Time. — Twenty minutes. 

Article. — Milk, two quarts. 

Directions. — Pour two quarts of milk 
into the Tea-kettle Boiler, have the 
water in the tea-kettle boiling, place the 
boiler in the tea-kettle, let it remain twenty 
minutes, or longer. It will not burn. 

Remarks. — Boiled, is much richer, better, and 
healthier, than without boiling ; the chemical action 
of heat upon milk condenses and solidifies it. In too 
many cases milk sold to families is watered or impure ; 
boiling it will correct this in a measure, as all physi- 
cians and chemists know that water boiled is made 
purer. The component parts of milk are about eighty- 
seven parts of water ; sugar, five ; caseine, five ; but- 
ter, three ; all perishable. When boiled, it will keep 
twice as long. In all recipes for cooking, boiled milk is 
used where milk is required. If the boiler was used 
for nothing else it is worth the price of it for one 
month's use for this purpose alone. 



MILK, COFFEE, TEA, AND COCOA. 



3. Skim Milk. 

Time. — Twenty minutes. 
Articles. — Milk, two quarts ; com starch, 
white sugar, butter, each a table-spoonful. 

4. Condensed Milk. 

This article of food is one that we cannot too highly 
praise, and we recommend our readers to use it. Two 
of my children were saved by its free use in the last 
stage of scarlet fever, when too weak to eat anything 
else, by the recommendation of a physician. My 
youngest child, only eight months old, could not drink 
cow's milk without its souring on its stomach, causing 
great pain, and keeping it awake, and constantly wor- 
rying, but, by using Condensed Milk, it at once 
relieved the babe, and it is now a strong, healthy 
child. I feel it a duty I owe, not only to the Con- 
densed Milk Companies, but to the community, to 
state these facts. The taking out of about 80 per cent, of 
water, and the chemical action of condensing, improves 
and enriches it. We now use it for every recipe 
where milk or cream is directed in this book, and 
advise our readers to use it also. It is Cheaper, 
Healthier, Handier, Lkss Liable to Sour, and 
KioHBR, in making Ice Cream, or for any cooking 
where rich milk is required. Fob Coffee use it 
without tcater to suit the taste, it imparts a richness 
that nothing else can. 

Milk is so important an article for babes, children, 
the sick and invalid's diet that the mother or nurse 
cannot use too much care to get it pure, good, whole- 
some, and the very best that the market atfords. 

See Advertisements op the Condensed Milk 
Companies in this Book. 

5. To preserve Milk. 

Boil it in the Tea-kettle Boiler, add 
a quarter of a tea-spoonful of soda to two 
quarts. 

6. Cocoa Milk. 

Time. — Fifteen viinutes. 

Articles. — Quarter of a pound of cocoa ; 
a quart of milk. 

Directions. — Pour the milk into a Tea- 
kettle Boiler, let the milk boil ; then 
pour in the cocoa first powdered and made 
to a paste. Chocolate may be made the 
same way. 

Remark. — Cocoa or chocolate Is very healthy and 
nutritious, and for children excellent. 

7. Cocoa or Chocolate. 

Time. — Fifteen minutes. 

Articles. — Quarter pound of cocoa or 
chocolate; half a pint of milk; water, a 
quart.

Time. — Fifteen minutes. 
Articles. — Rice ground, a table-spoonful ; 
nulk, a prut. 

Directions. — Boil the milk in a Tea- 
kettle Boiler, then add the rice, sweeten 
and flavor to taste. 

Remarks. — Rice, flour, corn starch, arrow-root, 
made in the same proportions is as good. Half a tea- 
spoonful of magnesia added will correct acidity of the 
stomach ; there is no better food for the sick, feeble, 
children, and infants. 



9. Coffee Milk. 

Time. — Twelve Minutes. 

Articles. — Two table-spoonfuls of ground 
pure coffee ; a pint of milk ; water, half a 
tea-cup. 

Directions.— Pour the mUk into a Tea- 
kettle Boiler; after it boils add the 
coflfee first soaked in boiling water ; let it

10. Improved French Coffee. 

Time. — One minute to make. 

Articles. — African, Mocha, or Java, two 
parts Maracaibo or Rio, one part ; as pre- 
ferred, or either one alone ; boiling water. 

Dii'.ECTioNS. — Keep your coffee in a tight can, grind 
it to a fine powder Just as it is to be used, place the 
Patent Coffee Cone in a pitcher, or china, stone, or 
earthen water pot; put in the Powdered Coffee, pour 
in BOILING hot water, as much as needed. The 
liquid coffee runs through as clear and as strong as 
brandy. Use boiling milk. 

Remarks. — No other is given, for the wretched way 
of boiling it is not cooking ; it is spoiling the aroma of 
coiTee, which is all there is of it fit to drink. Mocha 
and Java makes the best, except a few costly scarce 
kinds. Coffee is very stimulating, and, I believe, good 
for those it agrees with. I would advice families to use 
nothing but pure coffee. Buy it in the bean, roast it 
yourselves.

Teas are very much adulterated now, by mixing 
damaged and cheap teas with good ones.

JELLIES. 



11 



JELLIES. 

49. Gelatine and Isinglass. 

Animal Jellies are nutritious and very 
cheap, if made according to our directions, 
and are very pleasant to the taste. They 
have been considered very expensive and 
not hearty. This is a mistake. Jellies are 
the very strength of meat and the vital 
juices, so to speak. Fruit and farina jellies are 
the samp ; try them by our directions ; if 
you do not wish the trouble, prepared gela- 
tine can be easily purchased at the stores. 
Animal jelly can be made of calf's head 
and feet, pig's head and feet, cattle's feet 
in making jellies. The head and feet are 
good for the table, and make a good meal 
(see recipes for cooking for the table), so 
that the jelly is a clear gain ; only a little 
trouble, a trifling expense, and you have a 
delicacy for well and sick. Use the Tea 
KETTLE Boiler in preparing them. 

50. Plain Jelly Stock. 

Time. — To clean, half an hmir ; to boil, 
six Jiours ; to clarify, ten minutes. 

Articles. — Calfs feet, four, or a calf's 
head, or a hog's head, or four ox heels ; pig's 
feet for either ; four quarts of water ; sugar, 
two ounces ; one ^gg. 

Directions. — Take either of the above 
(not all), scald and clean them in boiling 
hot water, knock oflf the hoofs or horned 
part of feet, take out the eyes and brains 
if it is the head. Split the feet or head, 
put them into the pot, add a gallon of cold 
water, boil six hours, or until very tender ; 
then remove with a skimmer ; use no salt or 
spice in the water (the meat can be used for 
food as directed below). When it is cold, 
skim off every grain of fat ; a gallon of 
water generally makes a quart of jelly, 
which, after it is cold, must be clarified. 

51. To Clarify Plain Jelly Stock. 

Time. — Twenty minutes. 

Articles. — Stock, a quart : one egg ; 
sugar, two ounces ; flavor. 

Directions.— Pour a quart of the stock 
into a Tea-kettle Boiler, add the white 
of an egg, vnth the shell well beaten to- 
gether, two ounces of sugar, and any flavor 
preferred ; let it boil six minutes ; then 
skim, pour aU into a jelly bag, or through 
a piece of cotton cloth, run it into a bowl 
or mold. More eggs can be added if de- 
sired. 

Remabks.— If you wish to make it any flavor, do 
so while the stock is hot. Jellies take their names 
from the flavor : Lomon, Orange, Cinnamon, &e. The 
cost of a quart of jeUy is but the labor and ten cents at 
the most ; for the meat is worth all that is paid for it. 



52. Lemon Jelly. 

Time. — Altogether] one hour. 

Articles. — Peel of four lemons and juice ; 
three glasses of sherry ; three-quarters of a 
pound of loaf sugar ; one ounce and a half 
of gelatine or stock ; one pint of water. 

Directions.— Steep the thin peel of four 
lemons in half a pint of boiling water until 
strongly flavored with the peel. Put the 
sugar pounded vdth the stock into the Tea- 
kettle Boiler, and boil it slowly for about 
a quarter of an hour or twenty minutes ; 
then add the strained lemon juice and the 
water from the peel. Let it just boil up ; 
skim it well, add the wine, and strain it un- 
til quite clear. 

53: Orange Jelly. 

Time. — About an hour. 

Articles. — Peel of four oranges and two 
lemons and juice ; a quarter of a pound of 
loaf sugar ; a quarter of a pint of water ; 
two ounces of gelatine. 

Directions. — Grate the rinds of the 
oranges and lemons, squeeze the juice of 
each, strain it, and add the juice to the 
sugar and the water, and boil it until it 
almost candies. Have ready a quart of jelly, 
put to it the syrup, and boil it once up. 
Strain ofi^ the jelly, and let it stand to settle 
before it is put into the mold. 

54. French Jelly. 

Articles. — One quart of calfs foot or 
clear gelatine or stock ; some ripe fruit, or 
any preserved or brandy cherries. 

Directions. — Have ready one quart of 
very clear jeUy, select ripe and nice looking 
fruit, and pick off the stalks ; commence by 
putting some jelly at the bottom of the 
mold, and let it remain about two hours to 
harden ; then arrange some fruit according 
to taste round the edge of the mold; if 
currants, lay them in as they come from the 
tree, on their stalks, and pour in more jeUy 
to make the fruit adhere, and let that layer 
also harden ; then add more fruit and jelly, 
until the mold is full. If peaches, apples, 
apricots, &c., are used, they are better boiled 
first in a small quantity of syrup ; but straw- 
berries, grapes, cherries, or currants may be 
put in uncooked. An extremely pretty jelly 
may be made from preserved fruits, or brandy 
cherries. It may be garnished with any fruit, 
or an open jelly may have some strawberries 
piled in the center, or a whipped cream piled 
up, with strawberries stuck in it, which has a 
very good effect. 

55. To make Twenty Kinds of Jelly. 

Take a quart of jelly stock, or make it 
out of gelatine ; then make and add any 
of the recipes to make ice-cream.

ICE CREAMS, WATER ICES, FROZEN CUSTARDS. 



lOE CREAMS, 

WATEE lOES, FROZEN OTJSTAEDS. 

HOW TO MAKE ALL KINDS, AND THE COST 
OF THEM, AND THE PKOPER WAY OF 
EATING THEM. 

Many families think because ice cream 
and water ices are sold so high in the con- 
fectionaries that they must be expensive to 
make. It is a mistake ; it is not so. As we 
have repeatedly said, a variety of food is 
essential to the maintenance of human life. 

Cheap luxuries are also, in moderation, 
necessary to pleasure and enjoyment after a 
hard day's work. We know of nothing more 
delightful and refreshing than ice cream, for 
milk, sugar, eggs, and fruits are all healthy 
and very nutritious; so it is not money wasted 
that you spend for ice cream or water ices. 
Ices are cheaper, but of course not so sub- 
stantial. In eating them DO NOT gobble 

THEM DOWN IN A HUKRY, BUT LET THEM 
MELT IN YOtm MOUTH. THAT IS THE WAY 
TO EAT THEM, AND WE WILL GUARANTEE 
NO ONE WILL EVER BE HURT BY EATING 
ICE CREAMS OR WATER ICES. The Swallow- 
ing of masses of ice cream upon a heated 
stomach is enough to make any one sick, 
but when it is melted in your mouth it 
can not. 

Condensed MUk used alone, or in propor- 
tion of one part water to one pa/rt Condensed 
milk, will be found an excellent substitute for 
cream, and much richer. Two or three parts 
water to one of Condensed Milk, toiU make 
good cream. If you live where you cannot 
get it at the door, use the canned milk, which 
does not require sugar. Try it and you 
will prefer it to cream, or common milk. 

Lemon Juice makes the flavor taste ricTier. 
Sometimes it is not to be put in. It will be 
stated when. 

56. How to make Ice Cream. 

Time. — From ten to twenty minutes. 

ARTlCLEa — Sweet milk, a pint; a table- 
spoonful of sweet butter ; white sugar, half 
a pound ; juice of one lemon ; two well- 
beaten eggs (or not) ; essence, half a tea- 
spoonful, or fresh fruit a pint, or syrup of 
fruit, half a tea-cupful ; a table-spoonful of 
maizena, or flour, or pure corn starch. 

Directions. — Boil the milk in the Tea- 
kettle Boiler ; add the butter, a spoonful 
of corn starch, maizena or flour, first stirred 
up in a little cold milk ; add to the milk 
then two well-beaten eggs ; let it get cool, 
then stir in the essence or juice of fruit or 
syrup as directed below ; freeze. Cream is 
richer than milk, but can not be got readily, 
and is expensive. Those who use cream 
need no butter or flour. 



57. Frozen Custards 

Are made as above, except using two table- 
spoonfuls of maizena, and boiling all until 
thick. Flavor and freezing are the same as 
ice creams. If you desire, these custards can 
be made without freezing. 

58. Water Ices 

Are made in the same manner, using ice- 
water instead of milk, without eggs, and no 
boiling. 

59. Fruit Creams, Ices, and Custards. 

Juices direct from fresh fruit are the best 
and the cheapest, where parties raise it. Jam 
your berries or fruit ; sprinkle half a pound 
of white sugar over it ; squeeze a lemon 
over the sugar ; let it stand one hour, then 
sift it through a fine sieve, or better, squeeze 
it through a piece of cotton cloth ; then 
stir it well into the cold milk, as prepared 
for creams and custards, or water for ices, 
and freeze at once. 

60. Spice Creams, etc. 

Steep whole spice in a gill of hot water. 
Use this instead of fruit. Coffee, tea, and 
chocolate come under this class. If whole 
spice is not to be had, tie up ground in a 
cloth. 

61. Essence Creams, etc. 

Where essences can be bought they are 
the handiest ; half a teaspoonful to a pint of 
milk. Custards can be made of any of the 
recipes. We generally use the essences, as 
they are no trouble. 

TO COLOR. 

Ice Creams, Water Ices, Jellies, and 
Custards can he made of different colors. 

62 Red. 

One ounce of cochineal, one ounce of salts 
of wormwood, one pint of water boiled five 
minutes ; take it off" the fire, add three 
ounces of cream of tartar, one ounce of rock 
alum; put them ia slowly or it will boil 
over ; add, if to heap, sugar syrup, instead 
of water. 

63. Purple. 

Infuse a pound of mallow flowers in a 
quart of water six hours ; add a little salt 
of tartar ; strain ; it gives a deep purple, 
or boU an hour and. add a little hucklebery 
juice, or use huckleberries or blackberries. 

64. Yellow, 

Use the yolks of eggs, or, for a bright yel- 
low, soak a half pound of turmeric root iD a 
pint of alcohol until it is yellow enough. 
Color to Bui+ 

65. White. 

Use milk, white of eggs, white sugar, and 
white essence. 



ICE CREAMS, WATER ICES, FROZEN CUSTARDS. 



13 



66. Pink. 

Use currants, raspberries, or strawberries, 
or a little red coloring. 

67. Brown. 

Coffee and chocolate creams are brown. 

The different kinds of Ice Creams, Wa- 
ter Ices and Custards are made as fol- 
lows : — 

68. Strawberry 

Take a pint of fresh strawberries, jam 
them with a spoon ; sprinkle half a pound 
of sugar over them ; then squeeze a good 
sized lemon over it ; add coloring if desired ; 
let it stand an hour ; sift it through a fine 
sieve, or press the juice through a cloth ; if 
the sugar has not all melted, stir it up in 
the fruit, add half a tea-cupful of water, 
then stir this juice into the cold prepared 
cream and freeze at once. If you have no 
fresh strawberries, use the canned ones, or 
essence, or syrup, as above directed. 

69. Raspberry. 

Made same as strawberry. A delicate 
dish, and pink. 

70. Blackberry. 

Made same as strawberry. As healthy a 
cream as made. 

71. Whortleberry.

85. Cinnamon. 

Same as ginger.. 

86. Vanilla. 
Same as ginger. 

87. Clove and Allspice. 

Same as ginger. 

88. Fee Cream Freezers. 

There are now in the market many ice 
cream freezers that will freeze ice cream in- 
side of five minutes, and sold so low that 
any family can buy one. They rarely get 
out of order, and last for many years. By the 
use of one of these the process of freezing is 
rendered so much more expeditious and sat- 
isfactory as to more than compensate for the 
trifling expense involved in its purchase. 
They all have the wooden tubs to hold the 
salt and ice. 

89. Directions for Freezing 

Always accompany them, but we give the 
following directions that you will always 
have them, and if you do not have a freezer, 
you can do so by using a tin paU and a 
bucket. A quart of ice cream can be frozen, 
taking care that there are no holes in the 
freezer to let in the water and spoil the 
cream. Set the freezer, containing the 
cream, in a wooden tub or bucket several 
inches larger, and pack closely around its 
sides a mixture of pounded ice and salt 
(mixed in the proportion of six pounds of 
ice to one of saJt), extending to within two 
inches of the top of the freezer ; cover the 
freezer and keep it in constant motion, re- 
moving the cover frequently (if it does not 
clean itself as some do) to scrape the con- 
gealed cream or ice from the sides with a 
silver spoon or wooden paddle, taking care to 
keep the sides clear, and stirring it well to the 
bottom. Keep the tub well filled with salt 
and ice outside the freezer, and take care 
that none of the salt water gets in to spoil 
the cream. The outside tub or bucket 
should have a hole in or near the bottom,, 
from which the bimg can be removed to 
allow the water to pass out as the ice melts. 
After the cream is well frozen, it may be 
packed in molds, and set in salt and pounded 
ice. When you wish to serve it, wrap the 
mold with a hot cloth a minute, so as to 
loosen it ; turn out the cream on a dish and 
serve immediately. 

Other Rbcipes well be given here- 
after.

MAIZENA. 



M AIZEN A. 

It is the farinaceous product of corn. It 
affords many delicate, nourishing, attract- 
ive, and palatable dishes, easily simulated 
by deranged organs, suitable for the use of 
invalids and children, as well as for family 
use. In custards for thickening it is prefer- 
able to wheat flour. It is the best pudding 
any cook can make. With a paper of this 
in the house, and some milk and sugar, an 
egg or two, a pudding or cake can be had in 
a few minutes, easy of digestion, a luxury, 
and very nutritious. It must always be 
boiled in the Tea-kettle Boiler, or some 
water boiler, to prevent burning, as it is 
very liable to scorch, and, as the flavor is 
delicate, spoiled. In adding the maizena to 
the milk, it must be first wet in cold milk ; 
this prevents its being lumpy ; powdered 
sugar is best to use with it.

CORN STA.RCH. 



15 



COEN STARCH, 

Like the maizena, is tlie product of Indian 
corn, and deservedly ranks high as an 
article of luxurious yet cheap food. It is 
all nutriment, and differs from maizena in 
the manufacture ; both are good ; try both ; 
same recipes for both. 

Corn starch has a peculiar thickening 
property in itself, and owing to being cheap 
and hearty, should be extensively used for 
custards, blanc mange, creams, jellies, gra- 
vies, omelets, soups for children and invalids, 
and the well. 

The preparation of maizena and com 
starch is very simple, when the Tea- 
kettle Boiler is used, giving no care or 
trouble about burning or spoiling. 

Corn Starch must be first mixed in a 
little water or milk before being stirred into 
the Tea-kettle Boiler, as it prevents its 
being lumpy.

Rkmabks.— Eggs are generally dear in price ; nothing 
has ever taken the place of them ; but corn starch in 
its composition is partly a substitute, and that is one of 
the reasons why it is so good in making omelets. 
Herbs, ham, or meat can he used to give a flavor, and 
add to the quantity.

CORN STAitCH. 



109. General Recipe for making Corn- 

Starch Jellies. 

Time — To make, about ten minutes. 

Articles. — Three to four table-spoonfuls 
of corn starch, or maizena, one quart of sweet 
milk, or a half a pint of condensed milk, and 
t^i-ee half pints of water, or a quart of water ; 
sweeten to taste with sugar, less than a tea- 
cupful will do ; half a pint of wine improves 
the jelly. Fruits, essences, spices, juices of 
lemons, oranges, etc., can be used to flavor, 
same as for ice creams and frozen custards. 

Directions. — Boil the milk or water and 
sugar in a Tea-kettle Boiler, mix the corn 
starch in a little cold water, pour into the boil- 
er, let it boil five minutes. Stir it up, flavor 
with any fruit, essence, etc., to suit the taste ; 
color with any color, same as for ice creams ; 
two or more colors can be made by dividing 
the jelly, and coloring one part ; turn it into 
the mold. Let it cool ; then pour in another 
part with a diflerent color. 

Remabks. — These jellies are very cheap, easily made 
with a Tea-kettle Boilee, and nutritious and healthy 
for invalids, children, and well persons. A little prac- 
tice will enable the cook to make them perfect. Molds 
of crockery and metals can be bought cheap. 

110. General Recipe for making Corn- 

Starch Custards.

flavoring to taste. 

112. To Color Corn-Starch Creams, Cus- 
tards, Jellies, Puddings, and Sauces. 

For variety and ornament it is sometimes 
desirable to color them ; if any color is de- 
sired, use that used to color ice creams. 



113. Corn-Starch Sauces. 

Articles. — Milk, one cup ; sugar, one cup ; 
corn starch, three table-spoonfuls ; same of 
wine or brandy ; one of butter ; juice of half 
a lemon. 

Directions.— Heat the milk and sugar m 
a Tea-kettle Boiler, mix the corn starch 
with the brandy, butter, and juice of lemon ; 
add to the corn starch, and boil ten minutes 
with the cover on. 

Remaeks. — Corn starch sauces can be made of every 
variety by using the ice cream recipes for flavors, and 
following the above. Water can be used if no milk is 
in the house. 

114. Corn-Starch and Cocoanut Pies. 

Time. — Three hours and a half. 

Make the above recipe of jelly, line a deep 
plate with paste, bake it in a quick oven ; 
when done fill with the jelly, and again 
bake. This is richer than all cocoanut, and 
will be preferred. 

115. Milk or Cream in Corn Starch. 

It is almost useless to put cream in recipes, 
as it can not be had without trouble. To ob- 
viate that, mock cream can be used ; or, if our 
recipes are followed, the expense and trouble 
to get cream is avoided, except it is made from 

116. Condensed Milk. 

which is now in use, and can be used in all

a dish, remove the mold; the cake only is seen. 



EGGS. 

We have fifty good recipes to cook eggs. 
We give some of the plain ones, and shall 
in the future give the rest. Eggs in sum- 
mer are very cheap, especially in the coun- 
try, and we know of no better dish than 
well cooked eggs. They can be cooked for 
the invalid to digest in an hour, and the 
hearty man to digest in five hours; they 
contain a great deal of nutriment, and 
strengthen the sick and well. In cooking 
eggs the best way is to break them sepa- 
rately in a cup. for one bad one will spoil 
all that have been broken before. Always 
serve hot. As they are cheap and plenty in 
summer and scarce and dear in winter, it is 
best to save them for the time when they 
are expensive. 

119. To Preserve Eggs. 

There are several ways to preserve eggs, 
but they must in all cases be prepared fresh 
or new laid, otherwise they will not keep, 
no matter how they are fixed. The princi- 
ple of preserving is to keep them fresh, 
cool, and in the dark. 

120. To Preserve with Mucilage. 

Dissolve the gum arable in water to any 
ordinary thin paste, cool them, or dip them 
in it twice ; when dry, which is in a few 
minutes, lay them away in charcoal dust or 
bran, or dry sawdust ; put the box in a cool, 
dry closet or cellar, small end downward. 

121. To Preserve with iVIutton Fat. 

Melt the suet, dip them in it twice — do 
not have the suet too hot — and follow the 
above directions. 

122 To Preserve with Lime. 

To ten quarts of water, add two pounds of 
salt and two ounces of saltpeter ; boil to- 
gether for twenty minutes ; when nearly 
cold, add eight ounces of quicklime ; let it 
stand three days, stirring it every day ; 
place the small end downward in layers in 
a jar ; when filled pour in the mixture. 
They will keep for months ; the water 
should cover them two inches. 

Do not take out the eggs in any of the 
plans for preserving, until you wish to use 
them, as eggs are of a delicate nature, and 
easily spoiled after being kept some time.

CHEESE. 



19 



CHEESE. 

Cheese is another cheap food, cheap for 
the amount of nutriment in it ; it is not the 
quantity as much as the quality that gives 
nutriment. It is a fact, the poorer a cheese, 
the more muscle-making power it has; 
chemical analysis giving it the greatest 
amount of all food, especially skim milk 
cheese, as will be seen by the table on an- 
other page. Dyspeptics or those confined 
to the house, or costive persons must not use 
cheese as it is very binding ; to those whose 
digestive organs are strong, and work hard, 
it is good, or those who do not feel any bad 
effects after eating it. Persons should eat 
nothing that disagrees with them.

SALT FISH. 



SALT FISH. 

There is much nourishment in fish — 
almost as much as in meat, povmd for 
pound — also, medicinal properties, such as 
iodine, in them, which have a beneficial 
effect upon the health. In no class do we see 
so large families, handsome women, and 
robust, active men, or greater exemption 
from maladies than among fisherman and 
their families. As salt fish are easily pro- 
cured in anv part of the country, and gen- 
erally at a low price, we give many good 
and practical recipes, how to prepare them. 
Any dry, salt, pickled, or fresh fish will 
answer to cook. Codfish, however, is the 
best. Dry or pickled fish can be kept almost 
any length of time in a cool place. 

153. The Best way to Soak Salt Fish. 

Soak that intended for use in plenty of tepid 
water, adding to each gallon of water a tea- 
cupful of vinegar, if the fish is very dry and 
hard; use a table-spoonful of saleratus or 
soda to a gallon of water ; taste one of the 
flakes to ascertain when it is suflaciently 
fresh ; too much soaking will render the 
fish too insipid. Pickled fish must be soaked 
over night. 

154. To Cook Fish. 

Time. — A)i hour or two. 

Nothing is better to cook salt fish in than 
the Tea-kettle Boiler, as it must be 
heated gradually, and simmer very gently; 
boiling will make the fish hard and tough. 
It is generally to be picked in flakes free 
from bones, skin, and everything but fish. 

155. Fish Sauce. 

Time. — Twenty minutes. 

Mis a little flour in cold water ; aaa it to 
hot milk in the Tea-kettle Boiler; a 
little butter and salt ; add an egg or two if 
desired ; let it boU flve minutes ; then serve.

POTATOES. 



POTATOES. 

Plain and sweet potatoes are roots, and 
are extensively used among all classes. 
They are, when mealy, light, nourishing, 
palatable, and healthy ; but two-thirds of 
the potatoes are watery, and require differ- 
ent methods of cooking them from the ordi- 
nary way of boiling. When bought, if over 
FIFTY CENTS A BUSHEL is paid, they are not 
profitable as compared with meal and flour ; 
yet for a change it is well to have some once 
or twice a week ; but potatoes at a dollar a 
bushel are dear food, at two dollars they are 
extravagant. Many families never save their 
cold potatoes ; it is a mistake, for many of 
the best recipes require cold cooked potatoes. 
Potatoes are improved by soaking in cold 
water over night, or for an hour or two be- 
fore cooking.

water, and put them in cold water in the 
pot with a little salt ; boil slowly, the slower 
the better ; if the water boils too fast, set it 
further off from the fire. Try with a fork ; 
when done, pour off the water, put the pot 
on the stove, the cover off to dry the pota- 
toes ; serve hot as soon as dry. Never let 
the water stop boiling, as it makes them 
watery, 

180. To Boil New Potatoes. 

Scrape off the skins, and lay them in cold 
water for an hour or two ; boil as above. 

181. To Bake Potatoes. 

Time. — One hour. 

Directions. — "Wash, wipe dry, put in a 
hot oven, and bake an hour, or until done ; 
many prefer them this way. In cooking 
the four ways ahow, if not peeled cut off a 
thin slice from each end, it lets the water 
out from them. 

182. Mashed Potatoes. 

Boil the potatoes, peel and mash, season 
with milk, pepper, salt, and butter to taste. 

183. Browned Mashed Potatoes. 

Prepare as above, turn them into a pud- 
ding dish or pan, and set in an oven to 
brown ; this is an excellent way to cook poor 
watery potatoes. 

184. Potato Cakes.

them into cakes nearly an inch thick. Bake 
or fry them.

Directions. — Peel some good potatoes, 

throw them in cold water, heat pure lard so 
as to have the frying pan have an inch or 
more in it. Slice the potatoes very thin ; 
when the fat is boiling hot, put them in ; 
when of a delicate brown and crispy, remove. 
This is a quick cheap way, for they do not 
soak fat, and well done are a delicacy. 
Sprinkle a little salt on while hot. 
189. Potato Ribbons. 
Prepare and cook in the same manner as 
fried raw potatoes, except they are pared 
round and round into ribbons. 

190. To Fry them Light or Swelled. 

"WTien fried, turn into a colander, and 
have the fat over a brisk fire ; leave the po- 
tatoes in the colander only about half a 
minute, then put them back in the very hot 
fat, stir about one minute and put them 
again in the colander ; salt them and serve 
hot. If the fat is very hot when dropped 
into it for the second time, they will cer- 
tainly swell. There is no other way known 
to do it. It is as easily done as it is simple. 

191. To Broil Potatoes. 

Cut some cold boiled potatoes up length- 
wise, a quarter of an inch thick, dip each 
piece in flour, lay them on a gridiron over a 
clear fire ; when both sides are browned,

BEANS AND PEAS 

Are among the best and most nutritious of 
foods, and for the amount of nourishment 
and strength they give, to the actual cost of 
them, are among the cheapest of foods. A 
quart swells to over two quarts ; if old, they 
require more soaking. Add a little salt to 
the water in which they are soaked. These 
recipes answer for dry and fresh beans and 
peas. 

They are too hearty for dyspeptics, and 
should not be eaten by those of weak 
stomachs. 

The New England people eat them often, 
and especially every Sunday morning, and 
for dinner that day or the next. The found- 
ers of the six New England States almost 
lived upon them and corn. We give all the 
varieties of cooking them known.

MEATS. 

As all know, meats of all kinds are expen- 
sive. This has not always been the case ; 
but now it is, and many parts of animals 
are as good when cooked properly, or even 
better than the costly and fashionable parts. 
In Europe, all parts of the animals are used, 
nothing is wasted, and it will be so here as 
soon as people understand how to cook them. 
This is most important, and when the wife 
or cook can make a wholesome, palatable 
dish at a saving of from one-half to three- 
quarters in price, it is her duty to do it, and 
save money.

HAMS, SHOULDERS, AND BACON— SUNDRIES. 



37 



HAMS, SHOULDERS, AND BACON. 

HOW POOR ONES AEE MADE GOOD BY 
COOKING. 

Hams, slioulders, bacon, and pickled pork 
are very economical and handy dishes, as 
they are so hearty that a person can not 
eat much ; properly cooked, they are a lux- 
ury. By our mode of cooking, a common 
1 1 ham or shoulder is made as good as the best 
j sugar-cured ones. Never buy them imless 
warranted sweet. 

351. To Prepare Smoked and Salt Hams, 
Shoulders, and Bacon for Cooking. 

Soak any of them from twenty to fifty 
hours, according to the size, in three pails 
of water ; trim it neatly, removing any 
rusty parts — this soaking opens and fills 
the pores of the meat, which salting, 
smoking, and drying has hardened, and 
which cooking, withoiit long soaking, does 
not fill. By this process much waste is pre- 
vented. Try it, and this one recipe will pay 
for the book. 

352. To Steam Ham, Shoulders, and 

Bacon. 

Time. — About six hours. 

DrRECTiONS. — After preparing as above, 
pour over some boiling in a pot, with an 
ounce of whole cloves, an ounce of allspice, 
an ounce of pepper ; then put the meat in a 
steamer, cover tight and steam imtil tender ; 
eat hot or cold. 

353. To Boil Hams, etc. 

Time. — Five or six hours. 

DiRECriONS. — Prepare the ham as above, 
pour in enough water in a pot to cover the 
ham, add half an otince each of whole 
cloves, allspice, mace, and nutmeg, half a 
pound of sugar; boil until the skin peels 
and it is tender ; as the scmn rises skim it 
off carefully ; take off the pot and let it 
cool in the liquid until cold ; remove the 
skin whole. If to eat hot, of course take it 
out before cooling. 

354. To Bake a Ham, etc. 

Time. — Five hours. 

DiRECTioxs. — Prepare it as above ; cover 
it over with a quite thick paste, then put it 
in a pan, bake it in a moderate oven until 
done ; baste it; the flour prevents its drying 
up ; when done, remove the crust and skin ; 
Berve hot or cold. 

355. To Bake, Boil, etc., a Ham. 

Prepare and boil a ham as above directed 
for boiling three hours, no longer ; then put 
it in a moderate hot oven from the pot, and 
bake it two hours more. This gives a fine 
flavor to the ham. 



Remarks. — Any family once using the above recipes 
to cook hams, shoulders, bacon, and pickled pork, will 
use no other. We have repeatedly tried the most infe- 
rior hams this way, and then tried the old way with the 
best cured hams, costing much more, and found the 
common hams the best. 



356. Ox-Tail Soup. 

Tiu-E..—Two hours. 

Articles.— One ox-tail, white or Russia 
turnips, onions, potatoes, carrots, salt, pep- 
per, and flour.

ox tail in three-inch pieces, wash it, put it in 
the soup pot, cover with cold water, heat it 
slowly, as the scum rises to the top skim it 
off until all is removed ; when boiled two 
hours to a gallon of soup, peel and slice six 
white or two Russia turnips, six large onions 
or more small ones, also a dozen Irish pota- 
toes, and two carrots ; add salt and pepper 
to taste ; when almost done add flour, beaten 
up in water, strain boil up, then remove and 
serve. 

Rem AEK8.— Rice and barley can be added to soups, 
if preferred to flour. Any meat can be used—beef, 
mutton, pork, or veal.

night in a glass of port wine, and the "same 
of vinegar ; lay some good force meat over it, 
lard it with shreds of bacon, and bake it. 
Baste it frequently with port wine and vine- 
gar, in the same proportion that you used 
for soaking it, and season it with some 
pounded allspice. Serve it up with a rich 
gravy poured roimd it, with currant jelly in 
a tureen. 

359. Potted Ox Tongue.

butter over the top. A little roast veal 
added to the potted tongue is an improve- 
ment.

GENERAL RECIPES 

FOR COOKING MEATS, ETC. 

We give some general rules for soups, 
stews, roasting, baking, broiling, and frying 
meats 

365. Soups 
Are a compound of meats and vegetables, or 
meats and vegetables separately. Soups are 
called by the name of the principal meat or 
vegetables of which it is made. M eats should 
always be put in cold water for soups, heat 
gradually, and boiled gently. This takes 
nearly all the goodness from the meat into 
the soup. Soups are cheap, healthy, and 
nutritious, can be made out of the liquors 
that meats are boiled in, or shins and coarse 
pieces of meat, and are just as good. All 
kinds of vegetables, also rice and barley, are 
used to suit the taste. The Germans, French, 
and Russians are fond of soup. 



GENERAL RECIPES. 



39 



366. Stews 

Are similar to soup, but mucli thicker and 
richer ; less water makes a stew. 

367. Roasting 

la simply turning tho meats before a fire 
until cooked. As it is very seldom done, we 
will only say it is a good way to, but we do 
not think worth going to much trouble to 
do if you have a good oven, and use one of 
Bep.ney's Patent Roasting Pans, which 
will roast as well, and be more conveiJient. 
383 Baking is more Economical. 

All cooking in range, stove, or any oven, 
is baking ; therefore meats cooked in an 
oven is baking. Meats should be put on a 
grate in a pan to raise it an inch from the 
bottom of the pan, pour in a pint of salted 
water to keep the oven moist, hake slowly 
and steadily, baste frequently with the 
gravy ; the gravy is good plain or mixed 
with flour ; season to taste. 

369. Boiling 

Either salt or fresh meats, is a good way to 
cook meats ; hoil them tender, if fresh ; to be 
cooked wliole, drop it in hot water ; if corned, 
drop it in warm water. The first closes the 
pores of the meat, the second draws out the 
salt. Corned beef is a healthy dish. 

370. To Broil Beef Steak, VeaJ Cutlets, 

Pork and Mutton Chops, Liver, Fowl, 

Game. 

Grease the bars of your gridiron (use the 
kind that turns over instead of turning the 
meat), place the meats on it, and broil over 
a hot coal fire ; cut the meats one-half an 
inch thick ; do not stick a fork in them 
while cooking, as it allows the juice to run 
to waste. The meats should not have too 
much fat on them. After they are done lay 
in a hot dish (if not done return to the grid- 
iron at once). Salt and pepper to taste. 
Spread on good sweet butter ; recollect, serve 
and eat hot. This is the plain way of broil- 
ing any kind of meat, fowl, and game. Be- 
fore broiling or frying livers or hearts, soak 
in salt and water a few minutes if preferred. 

371. To Fry Steaks, Chops, Cutlets, 
Fowl, Game, etc. 

A large deep wrought-iron frying-pan is 
best. Always let the fat he hot hefore putting 
in the meat (/ prefer salt-pork fat fried out 
of clear salt pork to any other) ; lard, oil, or 
butter can be used. Have enough to cover 
the meat. All meats except beef should be 
well cooked. 

Watch the meat carefully, and turn 
often ; don't let it then burn. Salt and pep- 
per to taste ; hut do not salt until the meats 



are done ; salt hardens meats. Spread sweet 
butter over the meats hot. Put on a hot 
dish. Persons who like onions can cut up 
one or more, fry and cook in the gravy. 

372. Semi-Frying, or Broiling in the 
Frying-Pan. 

Heat it very hot, grease it, lay it in the 
meat, turn it constantly until done ; finish 
as above. 

373. Frying Covered Meats. 

Roll the meats in flour, meal, or bread 
crumbs, shake ofi" what will not adhere, and 
cook as above. Tomatoes, mustard, vinegar, 
wine, or any seasoning. 

374. Cutlets, Steaks, Chops, Beef's Heart, 
Liver, Tripe, etc., with Tomatoes. 

A pint of canned or whole tomatoes, an 
onion, a table-spoonful of sugar, salt and 
pepper to taste, a table-spoonful of butter, 
and three of fine bread crumbs, a tumbler 
of hot water. Let these simmer gently to- 
gether, while the meat is being fried or 
broiled ; take them out when done ; pour 
the tomatoes over them. 

375. Hashes, Entrees of Cold Meats. 

All meats (which are often) left over, also 
potatoes, will make good entrees, hashes, etc. 

370. To make Good Hashes, 

Take out all the bones, and leave only one- 
quarter of fat to three-quarters of lean meat. 
Onions, parsley, pepper and salt to taste ; 
chop all fine, heat up well, serve hot. 

377. Cold Meats 

Are often as good as hot eaten with the salad, 
or maitre d'hotel sauce. 

378. Entrees of Cold Meats, etc., 

Are made in most any style to suit the taste, 
by slicing and warming them in sauces, 
gravies, spiced and seasoned highly. 

379. Forcemeats, 

Or stuffings for poultry, and game, meats or 
vegetables, can be made of ham or bacon 
suet, veal, oysters, bread crumbs, soaked 
bread, or eggs : any spice or sweet herbs to 
taste. 

A selection can be made from any of the 
above list and flavor as desired. Some- 
times milk, butter, wine, and brandy, are 
used. Onions are used with bread to stuff 
geese, ducks, or strong game. 
■ Any meat or vegetables can be stufied, and, 
by using good taste, can be improved. 
Hereafter we will give many recipes for 
forcemeats and stuffings.

BAKED AND BOILED PUDDINGS. 



BAKED AND BOILED 
PUDDINGS. 

Puddings are generally cheap, and a 
healthy way of cooking I'ood, nutritious and 
agreeable to the taste. 

For boiled puddings you %vill require 
either a mold, a Tea-kettle Boiler, or 
a pudding'-cloth : the former should have a 
close-fitting cover, and be rubbed o'rst the 
inside with butter before putting the pud- 
ding in it, that it may not stick to the sides. 
A pudding-cloth must be kept very clean, 
and in a dry place. Bread, flour, and meal 
puddings should be tied very loosely as they 
swell very much in boiling. 

The water must be boiling when the pud- 
ding is put in, and continiie to boil until it 
is done. If a pudding is boiled in a cloth, 
there must always be water enough to cover 
the pudding ; but if boiled in a tin mold or 
a Tea-kettle Boiler, it is best not to let 
the water quite reach the top. When the 
pudding is done, take it out from the water, 
plunge whatever it is boiling in, whether 
cloth or mold, suddenly into cold water ; 
then turn it out immediately ; this will pre- 
vent its sticking. If there is any delay in 
serving the pudding, cover it with a napkin, 
or the cloth in which it was boiled ; but it 
is better to serve it as soon as removed from 
the cloth, basin, mold, or Tea-kettle 
Boiler. 

Bread or rice puddings require a moderate 
heat for baking ; batter or custard requires a 
quick oven. The time needed for cooking 
each particular pudding is given with the 
recipe. 

Eggs for puddings are beaten enough 
when a spoonful can be taken vip clear from 
strings. 

Souffles require a quick oven. These 
should be made so as to be done the mo- 
ment for serving, otherwise they will fall in 
and flatten.

CAKES. 



MAKING AND BAKING 
CAKES. 

Cakes are luxuries not necessary, and, 
where fat butter and spices are used are 
generally expensive, indigestible, and un- 
bealtliy ; yet civilized life seems to demand 
tliem and pay tbe penalty for eating them 
by sickness, loss of health, time, and money. 
We give the best known general directions 
for cooking that can be followed with con- 
fidence. 

An oven to bake well should have a regu- 
lar heat tliroughout, but particularly at the 
bottom, without which bread or cakes will 
not rise or bake well. 

An earthen basin is best for beating eggs 
or cake mixture. 

Cakes should be beaten with a wooden 
spoon or patent cake beaters. Butter may 
be beaten with the same. 

Eggs should be beaten with a broad fork ; 
or use the patent egg beaters : they cost but 
little, and are the best. Eggs should be 
clean and fresh for a cake. It is well, as a 
general rule in cake making, to beat the 
butter and sugar (which must be made fine) 
to a light cream ; indeed, in the making of 
pound cake, the lightness of the cake de- 
pends as much upon this as upon the eggs 
being well-beaten ; then beat the eggs and 
put them to the butter, and gradually add 
the flour and other ingredients, beating it 
all the time. 

In common cakes, where only a few eggs 
are used, beat them until you can take a 
spoonful up clear from strings. 

In recipes in which milk is used as one 
ingredient, either sweet or sour may be used, 
but not a mixture of both. 

Sour milk makes a spongy, light cake ; 
sweet milk makes a cake which cuts like 
pound cake. 

In making cakes, if you wish them to be 
pleasing to the palate, use double-refined 
sugar, although light brown sugar makes a 
very good cake. 

To ascertain whether a cake is baked 
enough, if a small one, take a very fine 
splint of wood and run it through the thick- 
est part ; if not done enough, some of the 
dough, or unbaked dough, will be fovmd 
sticking to it ; if done, it will come out clear. 
If the cake is large, pass a small knife blade 
through it, instead of the splint. Cakes to 
be kept fresh, should be placed in a tin box 
tightly covered, in a cool dark place. 

Other recipes for cake will be foimd in 
the Corn Starch, Meizenia, and Cocoanut 
recipes.

PASTRY AND PIES. 



PASTEY AND PIES. 

We could all exist without pastry or pies, 
and no doubt live longer, healthier, and 
wealthier, and we do not advise their indis- 
criminate use, yet plain pastry (for the mis- 
chief is caused by rich paste) in pies would 
do no particular harm. 

First, the cook should have smooth, cold 
hands, very clean, for making paste or crust. 
She should wash them well, and plunge them 
in cold water for a minute or two, in hot 
weather, before beginning her paste, drying 
them well first. 

The pastry slab, if possible, should be 
made of marble ; or a wooden paste-board. 
They should be kept scrupulously clean. 

The crust used for common pies may be 
made of clarified beef dripping, or lard, in- 
stead of butter. 

Be careful about the proper heat of the 
oven for baking pies, as, if it be too cold, the 
paste will be heavy and have a dull look ; if 
too hot, the crust will bum before the pie is 
done. 

Try if the oven is hot enough by holding 
your hand inside of it for a few seconds ; if 
you can do so without snatching it out again 
quickly, it is too cold. It is best, however, 
to try it by baking a little piece of the crust 
in it first. 

Always make a hole with a knife at the 
top of the pie to allow the gases, generated 
in it by cooking, to escape. This aperture is 
also useful for pouring gravy into the meat 
pie when done, if more is required. The 
hand of a pastry cook should be light, and 
the paste should not be worked more than 
is absolutely required for mixing it. 

We give first a plain recipe for pie crust, 
such as people of small means can use and 
vdll find good. A puflf paste, and one which 
will be found good enough for all ordinary 
purposes, of butter, flour, and eggs made 
stifle, will also suit raised piea Use spices 
to suit the taste. 

We begin by giving instructions for clari- 
fying hoTise fat so as to render it fit for use. 

430. To clarify House Fat. 

Put the fat in a pan, fry it out, then peel 
some raw potatoes, slice them in it, fry them 
brown, pour boiling hot water in the fat, let 
it all boil half an hour, then strain fat and 
water, and all the small impurities drop 
down into the water. 

This fat is good for any thing, except cake. 
Mix all kinds, mutton, beef, pork, or ham 
fat, all together ; only it must be sweet. 

431. To make Hygienic Pie Crust. 

Time. — Mfteen minutes. 

Equal quantities of flour, Graham flour, 
and corn meal ; rub evenly together, and 
wet with sweet cream or milk ; use same 
as other paste. This is excellent for the 



dyspeptic and feeble, as a change, good 
for all. 

432. Plain Pie Crust or Paste. 

Time. — Ten minutes. 

Articles. — Flour, a pound ; fat, four 
ounces ; water. 

Directions. — Put the flour into a bowl 
and work it into a smooth paste with water ; 
divide the fat into four parts ; roll out the 
paste ; put over it in rows one portion of the 
fat in pieces the size of a bean ; flour it ; fold 
over the edges, and again roll it ; repeat the 
whole again three times, dredging a very 
little flour over the paste, and rolling thin 
each time ; do not touch with your hands 
any more than you can help ; use a large 
knife or spoon ; use ice water ; do this in as 
cool a place as possible. 

433. A French Puff-Paste. 

Time. — Ten minutes. 

Articles. — Flour, a pint ; butter, a pound ; 
two eggs ; one lemon ; a pinch of salt. 

Directions. — Pour the flour into a bowl ; 
make a hole in the center of it, in which put 
the yolks of two eggs, the juice of the lemon, 
salt, and ice-water, and a quarter of the butter 
into a paste ; dredge the board and rolling- 
pin with flour ; roll out the paste very thin ; 
put little pieces of butter on the paste ; fold 
over three times, still buttering (as the but- 
ter separates the paste and forms the flakes) ; 
do so three time : this forms nine flakes ; keep 
it cool, and at each turning let it cool, if con- 
venient in a refrigerator, a few minutes. 

434. To make other Pastes. 

The above is the way to make paste. 
Any amount of butter or fat, not to exceed 
pound for pound, may be used ; lemon Juice 
and eggs may be omitted. 

435. Sweet Apple Pie. 

Pare mellow sweet apples, and grate them 
upon a grater (a very large grater is neces- 
sary for this purpose). Then proceed as for 
pumpkin pie. 

436. Sour Apple Pie. 

Take nice tart apples, slice them ; add cin- 
namon. Fill the under crust an inch thick ; 
sprinkle sugar over them ; add a spoonful or 
two of water. Cover with a tliin crust, and 
bake three-quartos of an hour, in a moder- 
ate oven. 

437. Mock Green Apple Pie. 

To five soda-crackers add five cups of boil- 
ing water ; cover in a dish, let them soak ; 
add three full cups of sugar, two lemons — 
grate the rind, and add both rind and juice. 
Bake with two crusts. 

438. Mock Apple Pie. 

One large grated lemon, three large soda 
crackers, two even table spoonfuls of butter, 
two teacups of sugar, one egg, a wineglass 
of water, poured over the crackers. These 
will make two pies. Bake with two crusts. 



PASTRY AND PIES. 



47 



439. Apple and Pie-Plant Pie. 

Equal quantities of ajiple and pie plant 
made in the same manner as all pie plant, 
make excellent pie. 

440. Pie-Plant Pie. 

Remove tlie skin from the stalks ; cut 
them in small pieces ; fill the pie dish evenly 
full ; put in plenty of sugar, a tea-spoonful 
of water ; dredge a trifle of flour evenly 
over the top, cover with a thin crust, and 
bake the same as apple pie. 

441. Pumpkin Pie. 

Select a pumpkin which has a deep rich 
color, and firm, close texture. Stew and 
sift it. Boil some milk in the Tea-kettle 
BoiLEK, add to make it thin. Sweeten 
with equal quantities of sugar and molasses, 
and bake about one hour in a hot oven ; add 
ginger or nutmeg to taste. 

442. Squash Pie. 

This is superior to pumpkin, as it has a 
richer, sweeter flavor, and is better. It is 
made in precisely the same manner as 
pumpkin pie. Eggs and nutmeg can be 
added. 

443. Sweet-Potato Pie. 

Boil and sift through a colander any 
sweet potatoes, add milk, boiled in the Tea- 
kettle BoiLEK, and make the same as 
pumpkin pie ; or bake, or boil and slice, same 
as for sour-apple pie. 

444. Custard Pie. 

Articles. — Corn starch, one table-spoon- 
ful ; sugar, two ; one egg ; milk, a quart. 

Directions. — Boil the milk in the Tea- 
kettle Boiler, add the starch and sugar ; 
when it is all boiled five minutes let it cool, 
then add the egg well beaten, nutmeg, and 
a little butter, line some plates with pie- 
crust, pour in the custard and bake. 

445. Cherry Pie. 

Choose fair ripe cherries, the large black 
English being the best for this purpose; 
wash and look them over carefully ; fill the 
pie plate evenly full ; strew sugar over the 
top ; dredge in plenty of flour ; cover with 
a moderate thick upper crust, and bake one 
hour. 

446. Raspberry Pie. 

Take nice ripe berries, either red or black 
are about equally good ; wash and pick them 
carefuUy ; place them an inch or more thick 
on the under crust ; strew a small quantity 
of sugar, and a trifle of flour over them ; 
put on the upper crust and bake half an 
hour. 



447. Blackberry Pie. 

This is made in the same manner as the 
preceding. All berries for pies should be 
ripe or nearly so, and as fresh as possible. 

448. Whortleberry Pie. 

"Whortleberries make excellent pies, and 
are in market usually longer than any of 
the summer fruits. It is made in the same 
manner as raspberry. 

449. Cranberry Pie. 

Wash the berries in a pan of water, re- 
jecting all the bad ones ; simmer them un- 
til they become soft and burst open ; strain 
through a fine wire sieve, removing all the 
hulls ; add sugar to the taste ; bake on a 
thick under crust in a moderate oven. 

450. Peach Pie. 

Select rich juicy peaches, of a rather 
small and nearly uniform size. They should 
be very ripe; peel and slice them, fill the pie 
dish with them, sprinkle sugar and a little 
floiir over them ; add a table-spoonful of 
water, cover and bake one hour 

451. Plum Pie 

Is made in the same manner as the peach 
pie. It requires much more sugar to make 
it at all palatable. 

452. Currant Pie. 

Currants are made into pies by stewing 
them and sweetening according to the degree 
of acidity, and baking between two crusts in 
the ordinary manner. Or better still, merely 
fill the pie "with them without any previous 
cooking, sprinkle sugar over, dredge in a 
little flour, and bake the same as apple pie. 

453. Gooseberry Pie. 

This is made in precisely the same man- 
ner as currant pie ; it is very palatable. 

454. Minced Meats for Pies. 

One pound of currants, four pounds of 
peeled and chopped apples, one pound of 
suet chopped fine, one beef's heart boiled 
tender and chopped fine ; pull the strings 
from the suet and add one pound of raisins 
stoned and cut in two; the juice of four 
oranges and two lemons, with the chopped 
peel of one ; add of groimd mace and all- 
spice each a spoonful, and a timablerful of 
brandy. Mix aU well together, and boil the 
liquor down, and when done cover the mince 
meat over with the liquor and keep it closely 
covered in a cool place, until wanted for use. 
When you want to use the mince meat add 
cider to your taste. 

455. Imitation of Mince Pie. 

An excellent imitation of mince pie may 
be made by placing between the layers of 
raisins, currants and chopped apples; season 
precisely as for a mince pie.

INDIAN MEAL AND MUSH. 



INDIAN MEAL, 

MUSH, BREAD, BISCUIT, CAKES, 
PUDDINGS, &c. 

It consists of Indian corn ground coarse. In 
many parts of our country it is eaten in 
every variety of form, not only on account 
of its cheapness, but of its health and 
strength-giving qualities ; it agrees with 
most every one. Perhaps less of this is used 
in New York city and vicinity than in any 
other part of the country ; yet it is not be- 
cause the New Yorkers do not like it. No, 
it is because their wives and cooks do not 
know how to cook meal. At a celebrated 
eating house in New York they sell five 
times as much corn biscuit as wheat. 

Dr. Ira Warren, the eminent Boston, 
Mass., physician, says, " Corn needs no 
praise from me. It is comparatively cheap, 
nutritive, and wholesome, and is perhaps 
worked up into more savory dishes than any 
other, very nourishing as well as cheap." 

Dr. John King, of Cincinnati, Ohio, the 
head of the Eclectic Medical Fraternity, says 
of corn, " It furnishes a very healthy, nutri- 
tious, and palatable diet, and is especially 
adapted for the support of the energetic 
and hard-working classes. It is certainly 
preferable to the wheat bread." 

Dr. W. Beach, of New York city, the 
distinguished head of the Keform Practice, 
says, " Indian corn is probably the most 
healthy, nutritive food in the world. In 
fact, every physician recommends its use, 
where it agrees with the stomach for the 
weak and dyspeptics." 

The estimate of the cost to support a man 
on Indian meal at present prices (wholesale) 
is $2.50 a hundred pounds. Now, a pound 
when cooked makes two pounds and a half; 
this would be about ten dollars a year. Of 
course, no one would live on corn meal 
alone ; but where is the food that will com- 
pare with it ? Not one, not one. Compari- 
son of Indian meal with other products will 
be fotind in another column. If families woiild 
or have to economize, tliey should boar in 
mind that a pound of meal swells to more 
than double in cooking ; that it is nearly all 
nutriment ; that it takes four pounds of meat 
or potatoes to equal one pound of meal ; in 
reality, one pound of flour does not go as 
far as a pound of meal. 

We give more recipes for cooking 
Indian meal, and in greater variety 
than ever were given before by any 
and all the cook-books combined; try 

THEM. 

And recollect that every pound of meal 
used where flour would have been, saves you 
at least five cents, and any of the very palat- 
able dishes are cheaper than any others. 



Many families now use fried mush in place 
of potatoes ; children ninety-nine in a hun- 
dred prefer it. 

In all cases buy yellow meal ; it is sweeter 
and stronger than the white. It comes to 
the market sifted ; but in our recipes always 
sift it again. Buy meal made from old corn; 
it costs more, but keeps longer. Keep meal 
in a cool, dry place, uncovered.

FLOUR, BREAD, Etc. 

WHEAT FLOUR, Etc. 

the best and cheapest FLOLTl TO USE. 

Maryland, Virginia, Georgetown, St. Louis, 
and Southern flours generally are much the 
strongest ; they cost more but are as cheap 
in the end, for they make the most bread, 
and always the whitest. California flour is 
good and cheap,- compared with western 
flours ; they are not so strong as southern. 
A dark, sweet flour is full as healthy as any, 
and, of course, cheaper 



WHEAT, RYE, BARLEY, CORN, AND 
OAT FLOUR. 

Flour is made from all the above grains, 
especially from wheat 'and rye, for general 
use ; one contains about as much nutriment 
as the other, but general use and taste has 
selected wheat flour, although the Germans 
use much rye flour. All classes, however, 
are rapidly learning to eat it also. Well 
made, of good rye, it can hardly be told from 
wheat. The writer has made dinner from 
rye bread and cheese, on many occasions, and 
at one time a party of which she was one, 
called at a house in tlie country. The Ger- 
man woman said all she had was some 
bread and cheese. Not one of the party 
(eight in number, all Americans) knew 
what kind of bread they were eating until 
the writer told them. She said it cost her 
six dollars and a half a barrel ; good wheat 
flour was worth sixteen dollars filty cents at 
the time. I mention this fact to show that 
a poor German wife coidd make as good 
bread from rye as wheat flour, saving ten 
dollars a barrel. Flours are ground too 
fine ; the whiter and finer the flour the 
more starch, and the less nutriment and 
health-giving properties there are in it, and 
the more costly it is. 

Most people are unaware how unhealthy 
fine flour is In experiments made on healthy 
dogs with fine flour bread alone, with water, 
two years ago, it killed them all within forty 
days ; most of them died within thirty days. 
On Graham flour bread, which is wheat 
ground coarse, with the hulls or chaff in, 
they grew fat and healthy, and did not die. 
When fed on corn meal bread they were 
healthy and fat, and we assert that any 
one who should eat fine flour bread of 
any kind alone, vrithout medicine, would not 
live sixty days. The reason of it is that its 
starchy nature is like a paste, clogs up the 
stomach and intestines; the liver refuses to 
act ; the result is sickness and death. 

Let all enjoy nature and art, but not to 
excess. In many things fine flour is excel- 
lent — for cakes, pastry, and once a day for 
bread, biscuit, or rolls. 



FLOUR— YEAST AND YEAST CAKES. 



53 



In making bread, in our recipes below, we 
give a variety of recipes for making flour 
bread, and biscuit. Wheat, rye, corn, Gra- 
liam, and barley flours can be used in any 
quantity to suit the palate, or a Uttle meal 
of either of the above can be put in. A , 
pound of fine wheat flour costs as much as ' 
two pounds of rye or Graham flour, or three , 
of corn meal, giving no more nutriment. | 
Try a variety, for it is the spice of life. You j 
will not regret it. You will SAVE health

YEAST BREAD, etc. 

502. How to make Exce!!ent Yeast Bread, 

Rolls, Biscuit, Twists, etc. 

Yeast is made from hops, flour, potatoes, 
etc. We give three of the best ways to 
make it. Yeast acts by fermentation, which 
produces gases in the dough, and is held by 
it, in consequence making the dough light ; 
Heat causes the fermentation, cold prevents 
it. As the heat of the oven holds the 
dough just as the gases make it, — the 
more kneading the better, as it makes it 
fine. It is necessary, to make good bread, 
to understand the reasons f ally why yeast 
makes the bread rise; therefore, to make nice 
bread, etc., follow these rules : 

1st. Flour should be kept in a dry 
closet — if at all damp it vnW make the bread 
heavy. When about to make bread put the 
quantity of flour you are to use in a pan 
near the fire in order to have it warm and 
dry for use. Seven pounds of flour or meal 
make a good batch of bread. 

2d. Yeast. — Use fresh liquid yeast, or if 
your own, keep it well corked in a bottle ; 
or use the yeast cakes now for sale in 
the stores. The better the» yeast the less 
you require. Too much yeast makes the 
bread taste of yeast and has a bad effect on 
the bread ; it dries quick and is not so sweet 
as if risen slowly. Too little yeast will 
make it heavy. To seven pounds of flour or 
meal a gill of yeast. 

3d. Salt.— Sift it with the flour. To 
seven pounds of flour or meal, a large table- 
spoonful. 

4th. Fat. — Three table-spoonfuls of any 
fat kneaded into the dough after it has risen 
the first time, makes it flaky, rich, and short. 

5th. Cleanliness is all-important ; have 
the pans, hands, and arms clean. 

6th. Dough. — Never have it half made, 
nor allow it get cold before it is finished ; if 
you do, it will be heavy. After making it, 
cover the pan with a tliick cloth. 

7th. Kneading. — Fold the fingers over 
the thumbs, beat and pimimel the dough 
until it ceases to stick to your hands. Do 
this on making, and after it has risen. 
Much kneading makes it whiter and finer. 



Bread can scarcely be kneaded too much ; 
the reason is plain — the fermented yeast 
forms very small globules, making a dense 
yet light bread. 

8th. Souring. — If the dough sours, dis- 
solve a tea-spoonful of soda in as much hot 
water ; work it into the dough — some prefer 
it after this is in ; it makes a different taste 
to it, and the bread is whiter and tenderer. 

9th. Heat. — Dough should be made in 
cold weather in a warm room and kept there. 
If it is too slow in rising, set it over a pan 
of hot water and keep it warm. 

10th. Consistency. — If too thin, add 
more floury it should not run or s]:)read ; if 
too thick, let it rise a little longer, or add 
a little warm water, 

llth. To KEEP DouGFi Good. — Keep in 
winter in the cellar, or any cool place ; in 
summer in the refrigerator. By so doing 
you can have hot bread or biscuit at any 
time. If it sours, use the soda. 

12th. Baking. — Bake in a moderately hot 
oven for bread ; biscuit should have a hotter 
oven. 

13th. To know when Bread is Baked 
— When bread is brown and firm to the 
touch all over, it is done. We give the 
time of baking as near as possible, but the 
heat of the ovens varies very much ; there- 
fore care must be taken not to overdo or 
underdo the bread and biscuit. 

503. Hop Yeast Cakes. 

Injustice to our readers, and for their con- 
venience, we recommend the hop or yeast 
cakes to housekeepers. They are made 
tmiform, are handy, and can be used at any 
time. It saves running to the baker's, or 
bothering making yeast. 

504. How to use Hop Yeast Cakes. 

Directions. — Dissolve the hop-cake in a 
cup of blood-warm water, add flour enough 
to make a thick batter ; set in a warm 
place until it rises, or looks spongy — three 
or five hours according to warmth — before 
adding to flour, then proceed the same as 
with liquid yeast. Care must be taken to 
keep the dough in a warm place while 
rising Should it ever occur that the bread 
tastes of the yeast, it will be conclusive that 
there has been too much used for the quan- 
tity of flour. 

505. How to make Yeast Cakes. 

Put a large handful of hops into two 
quarts of boiling water. Boil three large 
potatoes until they are tender. Mash them 
and add to them two pounds of flour ; pour 
the boiling hop water over the flour through 
a sieve or colander, and beat it until it is 
quite smooth. While it is warm add two 
table-spoonfuls of salt, and half a tea-cupful 
of sugar. Before it is quite cold stir in a 
pint of good yeast. After the yeast has be-

BAKER'S, POTATO, AND HOP YEAST. 



come quite light, stir in as much Indian 
meal as it will take to roll it out in cakes, 
and place them on a cloth in a dry place, 
taking care to turn them every day. At 
the end of a week, or ten days, they may be 
put into a bag, and should be kept in a dry 
place. When used, take one of these cakes, 
soak it in some milk-warm water, mash it 
up smooth, and use it as any other kind of 
yeast.

of brown sugar, a quarter of a poimd of 
yeast. 

Directions. — Make tliree spoonfuls of 
flour into a smooth batter with a little cold 
water; then add to it nearly two quarts 
more water, and a quarter of a pound of 
brown sugar; put it over the fire; stir it 
occasionally, and then set it to cool ; when 
it is only lukewarm, add two table-spoonfuls 
of good yeast ; set it in a warm place, or near 
the fire, for a day to ferment ; then pour ofl" 
the thin liquor from the top, shake the 
remainder up, and put in a bottle for use, 
or keep it in a covered stone jar. A gill of 
this yeast will be sufiBcient for seven pounds 
of flour. 

507. Potato Yeast. 

Boil a quarter of a peck of potatoes, mash 
them fine, and tliin them a little with the 
water in which they have been boiled ; add 
some salt and a table-spoonful of brown 
sugar ; when lukewarm, stir in about half a 
pint or more of old yeast, let it rise, then 
cover it closely and put it in a cool place, — 
it la fit for use then. , 

508. Hop Yeast. 

Tie a large handful of hops in a thin bag 
and boil them in three quarts of water ; 
moisten with cold water a sufficient quan- 
tity of flour, and stir in the hop yeast while 
boiling hot ; add a handful of salt ; let it 
stand until it is about lukewarm, and then 
add about a pint of old yeast ; when it is 
light, cover it and stand it in a cool place, 
for use 

509. How to make Nice and Good Cream 
of Tartar and Soda Bread. 

It is very important to have light, sweet 
bread. It is not always convenient to have 
yeast bread, and a change is agreeable. 
To have the above chemicals pure and uni- 
form is all-important ; they will keep in tin 
cans any length of time, therefore we recom- 
mend that cream of tartar, saleratus, or 
soda, be bought in large quantities of whole- 
sale druggists, and buy the best 



Cream of tartar is made from the set- 
tlings of wine ; saXeratv^ and soda are made 
from potash. 

THE WAY THEY WOr.K. 

Cream of tartar is an acid ; soda and saf 
eratus are anti-acids. 

When the dissolved soda is worked into 
the dough, it meets the acid, and they fonn 
into gases, which, trying to escape, cause 
the dough to rise into little minute bubbles, 
the heat of the oven causes them still more 
to ferment, and then baking the dough 
forms a crust which confines the gases, 
and that causes the bread or biscuit to be 
light, 

1st. Cream op Tartar — Two heaping 
tpa-spoonfuls to two quarts of flour or meal ; 
sift it with the flour or meal. Too much 
tartar makes the bread sour, and is un- 
healthy. 

2d. Saleratus — An even tea-spoonful, 
or Soda a tea-spoonful, to two quarts of flour 
or meal ; dissolve first in half a tearCupful of 
of water; when dissolved, put it into the water 
or milk ; that is to be used as soda, imless 
prepared in this way is apt to discolor the 
bread. Too much soda makes the bread 
yellow and offensive, and is unhealthy. 

3d. Salt — A heaping tea-spoonful to two 
quarts of fiour or meal ; sift it with the flour 
or meal, and cream of tartar. 

4th. Fat. — A table-spoonful of any kind 
of fat to two quarts of flour or meal ; after it 
is sifted, work it in the dry flour or meal, 
that is if shortening is desired- 

5th. Milk or Water — A pint; milk is 
much the best, and adds all it costs to the 
goodness of the bread. 

6th. SduR OR Butter Milk — A pint. If 
you have or can get either, it is best, as 
it saves the cream of tartar, the acid of the 
milk doing as well ; use the soda, however, 
but no tartar. 

7th. Dough. — The dough must be as thin 
in consistency as possible, so as to pat it out 
on a board half an inch thick, and cut it 
with a round cake cutter. 

8th. The Oven. — Always have that ready 
and hot, for this bread must be baked as 
soon as made, in a quick oven, 

9th. Health. — Hot bread is not as 
healthy as cold bread, still a little will kill 
no one. As these biscuits are very good 
warm, the healthy can eat them. The dys- 
peptic and invalid had better not eat them. 

510. Yeast Powder, 

(not yeast cakes, nor hop cakes), is made 
of one-third soda, or one-quarter improved 
saleratus, or two-thirds of cream of tartar, 
well mixed. I prefer to iise the soda and 
tartar separately.

511. To make Good Corn Meal Yeast 
Bread or Biscuit. 

The above rules apply to com meal, or 
Graham flour, or rye meal, or brown bread, 
biscuit, etc., except, 

1st. They must be made thinner in a thick 
batter, and all the work can be done with a 
strong spoon ; no lard is needed ; they are 
not so much trouble to make. 

2d. They generally require molasses to 
sweeten them. 

3d. They require longer baking. 

4th. Com meal soda-biscuit and bread do 
not require so hot an oven as flour. 

5th. Except these five things the yeast 
and soda rules apply to the corn-meal recipes 
for bread, biscuit, etc. 

512. Rye or Wheat Flour Yeast Bread. 

TiATE. — One hour to hake loaves of two 
pounds' weight each. 

Articles. — Seven pounds of flour ; two 
quarts of warm water ; a large table-spoon- 
ful of salt ; half a pint of yeast ; two large 
table^spoonfuls of fat. 

DrRECTioxs. — Put the flour into a deep 
pan, heap it round the sides, leaving a hol- 
low in the center, put into it a quart of 
warm water, the salt and yeast ; have ready 
three pints more of warm water, and with as 
much of it as may be necessary, make the 
whole into a rather soft dough, kneading it 
well with both hands. When it is smooth 
and shining, strew a little flour on it, lay a 
thickly folded cloth over the pan, and set it 
in a warm place by the fire, for four or five 
hours in cold weather, or all night ; then 
knead it again for a quarter of an hour, at 
the same time kneading in the fat ; cover it 
over, and set it to rise again. Divide it into 
two or three loaves, and bake it in a quick 
oven. It will take one hour to bake it, if 
divided into loaves weighing two poimds 
each ; and two hours, if the loaves weigh 
four pounds each. This bread can be made 
of rye, or wheat, or Graham flour, or any 
kind that may suit. Com meal can be 
added. 

513. Graham Flour Bread. 

Time. — Bake a little longer tlmn yeast 
bread. 

Made same as yeast bread, adding a cup 
of molasses, and baking longer. This bread 
is made from Graham flour. If you wish it 
coarse, do not sift it ; if, on using it, it is 
found to be too coarse or opening for the 
bowels, the bran can be sifted out. More 
molasses can be added, or none, as preferred. 
It is better for costive persons than any 
medicine. 

514. Graham and Flour Bread. 

Made same as yeast bread, sifting the Gra- 
ham flour, and adding one-half wheat flour. 
Add a cup of molasses. 



515. Potato Bread. 

Time. — To bake, one and a half to tvno 
hours. 

An'nCLES. — Two and a half pounds of 
mealy potatoes ; seven pounds of flour ; a 
gill of yeast ; two ounces of salt. 

DiRECTiCNS. — Boil two pounds and a half 
of nice mealy potatoes, till floury ; rub and 
mash them smooth ; then mix them with 
sufficient cold water to let them pass through 
a coarse sieve, and any lumps that remain 
must be again mashed and pressed through. 
Mix this paste with the yeast, and then add 
it to the flour. Set it to rise, well-knead it, 
and make it into a stiff", tough dough. Bake. 

516. Rice Bread. 

Time. — One and a half to two hours. 
Articles. — Half a pound of rice ; three 

pints of water ; six pounds of flour. 
Directions. — Boil half a pound of rice in 

three pints of water, till the whole is quite 

thick ; with this, and yeast, and six pounds 

of flour, make the dough. 

517. Bread without Yeast or Soda. 

Time. — Five hours to rise. 

Articles. — Milk or water, a quart ; salt ; 
flour ; lard, two table-spoonfula 

Directions. — Make the milk or water 
lukewarm ; stir in the salt, as much as will 
do for the bread ; stir in flour to make a 
paste ; do this in a kettle ; set it in a pot of 
warm water ; keep the water or milk warm. 
In five hours it wiU foam like yeast ; then 
knead in flour and lard, put in pans, let them 
rise again, and bake in a quick oven. 

518. French Rolls. 

Time. — Half an hour. 

Articles. — One pound of flour ; one 
Ggg ; one ounce of butter ; one spoonful of 
yeast ; a little salt, and some milk. 

Directions. — Beat well the butter into 
the flour, adding a little salt ; beat an egg, 
and stir it into the flour with the yeast, and 
a sufficient quantity of milk, to make the 
dough rather stiff". Beat it well without 
kneading it ; set it to rise, and bake it on 
tins. This quantity will make about six 
rolls. 

519. Irish Rolls. 

Time. — Fifteen to twenty minutes. 

Articles. — Two pounds of fine flour ; one 
tea-spoonful of fine salt ; one dessert-spoonful 
of powdered sugar ; half a tea-spoonful of 
best carbonate of soda ; whites of eggs, and 
some sour buttermilk. 

Directions. — Mix with the flour, the salt, 
sugar, and carbonate of soda. Then beat the 
whites of two eggs into a strong froth, with 
a sufficient quantity of sour butterijiilk, and 
mix them up the same as rolls made with 
yeast. Make them up at once into whatever 



56 



ROLLS, TWISTS, AND BISCUIT. 



shape you like. Wash them over with the 
white of an egg, and bake them in a rather 
quick oven, of a light brown, for about a 
quarter of an hour, or according to the size 
of your roUs. They are very light and white. 
The sourer the buttermilk, the lighter the 
rolls will be. A basin of buttermilk will 
keep for a week, or very sour milk will an- 
swer as well. 

520. English Rolls. 

Time. — Ticenty minutes to bake. 
Articles. — Two pounds of flour ; two 
ounces of butter; three spoonfuls of good 
yeast ; one pint of warm milk. 

Directions. — Take the flour; rub the 
butter into it ; add the yeast strained, and 
mix all well together with a pint of warm 
milk. Set it before the fire to rise, make it 
into twelve rolls, and bake them in a mode- 
rate oven. 

521. Bakers' Roils. 
Time. — Twenty minutes to bake. 
Articles. — Three pounds of flour ; two 

table-spoonfuls of yeast ; one tea-spoonful of 
salt ; half a tea-spoonful of soda. 

Directions.— rPut the flour into a pan, 
make a hollow in the center, and put in the 
salt, soda, and yeast. Make it into a soft 
dough with some warm milk ; work or 
knead it until it is smooth and shining, then 
cover it and set it in a warm place, for two 
hours. Work it again very smooth, let it 
rise, and again knead and divide it in pieces 
twice the size of a hen's egg ; roll it between 
your hands to the length of your finger ; lay 
them so as to touch each other, on baking- 
tins, brush them over with milk, and set 
them in a quick oven, for fifteen or twenty 
minutes, until they are a delicate brown. 
Break one open to see if it is done, and serve 
them hot for breakfast, broken open, as cut- 
ting them when hot soddens them. To 
make a roll in form egg-shape, then not 
quite half lap it over, or cut round and lap 
over one-third. 

522. Bakers' Twists. 

Time. — Nearly one hour. 

Directions. — Let the bread be made as 
directed for bakers' rolls ; then take three 
pieces as large as a half-pint bowl ; strew a 
little flour over the paste-board; roll each 
piece under your hands to twelve inches, 
length, making it smaller in circumference 
at the ends than in the middle. Having 
rolled each piece in this way, take a baking- 
tin, lay one part on it, join one end of each 
to the other two, and braid them together 
the length of the roll. Join the ends by 
pressing them together ; dip a brush in milk, 
and pass it over the top of your twists. 
After ten minutes set them in a quick oven, 
and bake them for nearly an hour. They 
can be made smaller if desired.

beaten eggs put the yeast, soft butter, and 
salt. Stir into it sufficient flour to make a 
soft dough ; strew some flour over it ; lay a 
warm towel over the pan, and set it in a 
warm place to rise (three hours in the sum- 
mer, or until light in the winter). Dip your 
hands in flour, and work the dough down ; 
make it into small flat cakes ; lay them on a 
buttered tin pan, quite near each other, and 
bake them in a quick oven for fifteen min- 
utes, or until done. 

These cakes may be mixed at night, and 
baked for breakfast. Keep the dough cool 
for supper, if required. 

524. Sponge Flour Biscuit. 

Time. — About ten minutes to bake. 

Articles. — Flour, a quart ; sweet milk, a 
pint ; lard, a table-spoonful ; salt, a tearspoon- 
I'ul ; yeast, a tea-cupful.

527. Milk Biscuit. 

Time. — Half an hour. 

Articles. — Six liandfols of flour; half a 
pint of milk ; a small piece of butter ; half a 
tea-cup of yeast ; one egg. 

Directions. — Put the flour in a basin, 
with half a pint of milk and a small piece of 
butter; warm the milk — in the winter in- 
crease its temperature. Mix the yeast in a 
little cold water ; add it to the milk and bat- 
ter ; make a hole in the flour, and pour the 
mixed milk and yeast into it, stirring it 
around until it is a thick batter ; add to it 
one beaten egg ; cover it over, and set it be- 
fore the fire, keeping it warm. When it has 
risen a little, mix it into a dough ; knead 
it well ; put it again to rise ; and i^'hen 
it is risen a great deal, form your biscuit. 
They will take nearly half an hour to bake, 
or according to the size you make them. 
Rub them once, while hot, with a paste- 
brush dipped in milk. 

528. Sour Millc Biscuit.

Articles. — One pint of rye flour ; one 
pint of wheat flour ; then soda, half a tea- 
spoonful ; sour milk; fat, table-spoonful ; salt. 

Directions. — Rub the fat in the flour ; 
dissolve the soda in hot water ; add salt, to 
taste ; wet the flour with sour milk until a 
soft dough is formed ; make into thin bis- 
cuit ; bake in a quick oven ; vise all of one 
kind of flour, if preferred. 

529. Rye or Wheat Flour Crackers. 

Time. — Half an hour, to make and bake. 

Articles. — Rye or wheat flour, one quart ; 
butter or fat, four ounces ; soda, half a tea- 
spoonful ; salt, same ; milk.

of the flours, and tartar, salt, and sugar ; add 
the eggs well beaten, and the dissolved soda ; 
lastly, drop the batter in balls on a greased 
pan or small pans ; bake in a quick oven. 

531. Graham Flour Mush. 

This is an excellent article for infants and 
young children. It will do for a change, in 
the cases of adults, but is not equal to the 
coarser preparation of the grain. It is cooked 
like Indian mush. 



532. Unleavened Bread. 

This bread is made by the water-cure, and 
hygienic believers who are opposed to the 
use of yeast, soda, saleratus, salt, and cream 
of tartar. Persons with very weak stomachs 
wiU derive benefit from the use of this bread. 
As a change any one can use it, if they 
desire to. This bread requires a hot oven. 

533. Graham Gems. 

Into cold water stir Graham flour sufBl- 
cient to make a batter a trifle thicker than 
that used for ordinary griddle cakes. Bake 
from one-half to three-quarters of an hour in 
a hot oven, in small tins or a tin pan. The 
flour should be stirred in slowly. Use soft 
water or part milk. 

534. Graham Diamonds. 

Pour boiling water on Graham flour, stir- 
ring rapidly till all the flour is wet. Too 
much stirring makes it tough. It should be 
about as thick as can be stirred easily with 
a strong iron spoon. Place the dough with 
plenty of flour upon the moulding board, 
and knead it for tWo or three minutes. Roll 
out half an inch thick, and cut in small 
cakes or rolls. If a large quantity is re- 
quired, roU about three-fourths of an inch 
thick, and cut with a knife in diamond shape. 
Bake, in a very hot oven, forty-five minutes. 

535. Graham Biscuit. 

Make Graham mush as for the table; 
when cool, mix with it Graham flour suffi- 
cient to roll well. Knead for a few minutes, 
roU three-fourths of an inch thick, cut with 
a common biscuit cutter, and bake in a hot 
oven, fr5ni thirty to forty-five minutes. 

536. Wheat Meal Crisps. 

Make a very stiff" dough of Graham flour 
and cold water; knead thoroughly, roU as 
thin as possible, and bake for twenty min- 
utes in a hot oven. 

537. Oat Meal Mush. 

This, in Scotland, is called stirabout. It 
is a favorite with many persons, and makes 
a pleasant change of dishes. It is cooked 
precisely like Indian mush. 

538. Uses for Stale Bread. 

Stale bread may be cut into slices and 
softened by pouring a small quantity of boil- 
ing water over it. Cover the pan containing 
it, to prevent the escape of the steam. As 
soon as the bread is soft, season the slices 
with pepper and salt, have some hot lard, 
ham fat, or sausages, dripped in a pan, dust 
a little flour or Indinn meal on each slice, 
and fry them a delicate brown. Boiling 
milk, if you have it, is better than water to 
soften the bread.

OYSTERS. 



OYSTERS.' 



In many parts of our country oysters are 
to be had merely by gathiering tbeni on the 
shore. At most places they are sold very 
cheap. As a healthy, nutritious, and cheap 
article of food we recommend oysters ; many 
dishes can be made from them. 

In cases of debility, raw oysters and the 
soup are very strengthening. 

The American oysters are unquestionably 
the best that can be found. They vary in 
taste according to how they are treated, 
either after being dredged or while imbed- 
ded, and also according to the nature of the 
soil and water in which they have lived. It 
is very wrong to wash oysters ; we mean by 
washing oysters, the abominable habit of 
throwing them in cold water as soon as 
opened, then to be sold by the measure. It is 
more than a pity to thus spoil such an ex- 
cellent and delicate article of food. 

Oysters like lobsters are not good when 
dead. To ascertain if they are alive as soon 
as opened, and when one of the shells is re- 
moved, touch gently the edge of the oyster, 
and if alive it will contract. 

539. To Feed Oysters. 

Wash them perfectly clean with water, 
then lay them bottom downwards in a deep 
pan, and pour over them salt water ; the 
salt should be previously dissolved in the 
water, allowing about five or six oimces to 
each- gallon of water. Change the water 
every day. You may fatten them by putting 
oat meal into the water every day. 

540. To Keep Oysters Alive and Good. 

Put them in a clean pan, cover them with 
pure water moderately salted, and changed 
every day. Keep them in a cool place. 

541. To Open Oysters. 

In opening them, try and avoid cutting 
them by keeping the point of the knife close 
to the shell. In New York they crack the 
point of the oyster to open them, but they 
can be opened without that, and it avoids 
the fine pieces of shell getting into the 
meat of the oyster. 

542. Raw Oysters. 

When well washed open them, detaching 
the upper shell, then detatch them from the 
under shell, but leave them on it ; place on 
a dish and serve. 

To eat them, sprinkle salt, pepper, and 
lemon juice on, and eat. 

They are excellent eaten with thin slices 
of brown bread and butter. 

543. Steamed Oysters (Washington Style). 

Ti'iXE.— About ten minutes. 

Put a peck of oysters in a steamer, steam 
them until they open their shells, open them 
while hot, eat with vinegar and pepper or 
sauce, on the half shell or on a plate. 



Rem ABES. — Wehave eaten them in this style, and con- 
sider it one of the best modes of cooking them known ; 
in Washington it is very popular, we have seen over 
two hundred persons in one saloon eating them at the 
same time. 

544. Roast Oysters (in the shell). 

Time. — A few minutes. 

Wash some oysters, lay them on a grid- 
iron over a bright coal fire, roast until the 
shells open, lift ofi" the upper shell, put the 
lower half, with the oyster in it, on a plate ; 
eat them vnih butter and any sauce. 

545. Baked Oysters. 

Time. — A few minutes. 

Directions. — Wash some oysters, put 
them in a pan, then in a hot oven, and let 
them bake until the shells open ; serve and 
eat same as roast oysters. 

546. Boiled Oysters. 

Time. — A few minutes. 

Let the shells be nicely cleaned, boil the 
oysters in them as you do lobsters, and serve 
them in their shells with plain melted but- 
ter. 

547. Broiled Oysters. 

Time. — Six or eight minutes. 

Articles. — As many oysters as you re- 
quire ; one or two eggs ; bread crumbs ; a 
little pepper, and a small piece of butter. 

Directions. — Take the largest oysters 
from their own liquor, lay them on a folded 
napkin to dry off the moisture, then dip 
them into beaten eggs, and then into grated 
bread ; place a gridiron made of coarse wire 
over a bright, but not a fierce fire, lay the 
oysters carefully on it, and when one side is 
done turn the other. Serve them on a fold- 
ed napkin, or put a piece of butter on a hot 
dish, sprinkle a little pepper over it, lay the 
oysters on, and serve. 

548. Fried Oysters. 

Time. — Fifteen minutes. 

Articles. — Oysters, crackers, cayenne pep- 
per, salt, eggs, cream, and butter or lard. 

DmECTiONS. — Select the largest oysters 
for frying ; dry them ; have ready some 
grated crackers seasoned with cayenne pep- 
per and salt ; beat the yolks only of some 
eggs, and to each egg add half a table- 
spoonful of thick cream ; dip the oysters 
one at a time, first in the egg, then in the 
cracker crumbs, and fry them in plenty of 
hot pork fat or butter, till they are of a 
light brown on both sides. Serve them 
hot. 

549. Stewed Oysters Plain. 

Time. — Twenty minutes to stew. 

Articles. — Oysters, butter, pepper. 

Directions. — Stew as many oysters as 
wanted in their own liquor, add a httle but- 
ter and pepper to taste. Eat hot.

SALAD, BOILED, AND SCALLOPED LOBSTERS. 



LOBSTERS. 

Lobsters are very fine shell-fish, and are 
caught in abundance along the shores of the 
New England States and Canada. The male 
lobster is distinguished by the narrovmess 
of his tail ; the female or hen lobster has a 
broader tail and small claws. All of the 
lobster is good to eat, except the stomach 
and a small gut that runs through the 
lobster. The fiavor of the lobster is gen- 
erally considered to be superior, in both 
purity and delicacy, to that of the other 
crustaceas. Lobsters are a very agreeable 
and nutritive article of food; they are not 
appropriate substances for dyspeptics or in- 
valids. The usual way of cooking them has 
been to simply boil and eat them cold, with 
vinegar, or as a salad, but there are many 
other ways, which we give,. to cook these 
very economical fish ; which, we are as- 
sured, wiU be most acceptable to our New 
England households, and to all who admire 
lobsters ; and it may teach others to like 
them. 

573. To Chooso Lobster. 

The heaviest are the best, and very often 
a good small-sized lobster will weigh heavier 
than a large one. The male is the best for 
boiling, the flesh is firmer, the sheU of a 
brighter red. Hen lobsters are best for 
sauce or salad, on accoimt of their coral. 
They are generally sent to market boiled ; 
if you buy them alive, then proceed

first. If the head goes in first, it is killed 
instantly. Boil it briskly for an hour, then 
take it from the hot water, and lay it to 
drain. Wipe off" all the scum from it. A 
lobster weighing a pound takes one hour to 
boil, others in like proportion, more or less.

crack them at each joint carefully, and split 



the tail down the middle vrith a sharp knife.

JAMS, JELLIES, MAllMALADE. 



PRESERVES. 

JAMS, JELLIES, MARMALADE. 

For making preserves a good sound fruit 
and good white (granulated is really the 
cheapest) sugar should always be used. 

655. The Fruit 

should be sound, ripe, and -good ; any rind 
can be preserved, as well as many kinds of 
vegetables. 

656. The Sugar. 
We use for all purposes white granulated 
sugar ; it is the most economical in the end, 
dry and handy. 

657. The Preserving Kettles 

Most persons use a copper or brass kettle, 
but we prefer, for large lots, a porcelain one ; 
for a quart or two use the Tea-kettle 
BorLER. Never keep preserves in the kettle 
any longer than to cook them, as the metal 
will injure them. 

658. The Proportion of Fruit and Sugar. 

A pound of fruit to a pound of sugar is 
generally used; a tumblerful of water to a 
l^oimd of sugar to make the syrup. Always 
skim of all the froth or scum. 

659. To Keep Preserves Good. 

Put them in stone jars or vessels of 
glass, earthen or stone ; cover tightly and 
keep in a cool, dry place. Look at them 
every month ; if they are turning, scald them 
and return to the jars. Clean the jars. 

660. Damson Cheese.

ripe, put them into a jar, and to every quart 
of plums add the sugar. Bake them in a 
moderate oven until they are soft ; then rub 
them through a hair sieve. To every pound 
of pulp add half a pound of loaf sugar beaten 
fine ; boil it over a slow fire in a Tea-kettle 
Boiler, and stir it all the time ; pour it into 
shapes, tie brandy paper over them, and 
keep them in a dry place. They vsdll not be 
fit to use for three or four months. All 
cheese may be made by recipe except green- 
gage, which does not require so much sugar. 

661. Green Gooseberry Jam.

them quickly for eight or ten minutes, stir- 
ring all the time ; add the sugar pounded 
and sifted to the fruit, and boil it quickly for 
three quarters of an hour, carefully remov- 



ing the scum as it rises. When done, put it 
into pots, cover it with brandy paper, and

PICKLING VEGETABLES AND FRUITS. 



PICKLING VEGETABLES 
AND FRUITS. 

We do not consider pickles healthy for 
the -well, and they are positively injurious 
to the weak and sick. No case is upon 
record, that we know of, of their curing the 
sick, but many of their kUling the feeble 
invalid ; yet a few now and then would not 
seriously injure the well and strong. Im- 
mense quantities are put up every year, sold, 
and eaten, and it is considered a necessity of 
civilization. As many families desire to put 
them up, we give a number of recipes that 
wiU aid the pickler. 

672. The Vinegar. 

Procure always the best apple, or white 
wine vinegar. The success of good pick- 
ling clepencls upon using good vinegar. 
Always boil the mnegai' unless stated other- 
wise. 

673. The Vegetables and Fruit 
should be sound and good. 

674. Cooking Utensils to use in Pickling. 

Use saucepans or kettles lined with por- 
celain. If copper or tin is used to boil vin- 
egar in, do not let it remain in them a 
moment longer than is necessary to boil 

them. Use WOODEN KNIVES AND FORKS. 

675. The Bottles, Jars, or Vessels. 

Use glass bottles for pickles. If jars are 
used they must be unglazed,as the glaze, acted 
upon hy the mnegar, produces a strong poison. 
Wooden vessels for large quantities are best. 
Fill either of them three-quarters full of 
pickles, then fill with vinegar. 

676. From July to October. 

Cauliflowers, peppers, cucumbers, onions, 
garlic, melons, tomatoes, beans, cabbage, 
mushrooms, beets, artichokes, horseradish, 
peaches, plumfe, and barberries may be 
pickled.

little cayenne pepper ; put all these ingre- 
dients into a quart jar, with the vinegar 
boded and poured over them, and when 
cold, fill the jar three parts full, and let it 
stand for a fortnight. Everything you 
wish to pickle must be salted and dried in 
the sim for three days. The jar must 
be full of liquor ; and, after it is finished, 
for use stop it down for six weeks or two 
months before using it. The vinegar

them in a cold place for eight or ten days ; 
then drain off the vinegar, make it hot, 
skim it, and again pour it over the peaches ; 
let them become . cold, then put them iuto 
glass jars, and secure them as for preserves. 
The cinnamon and cloves can be added to 
the peaches, and the hot vinegar poured 
over them.

COFFEE. 



THE DIFFERENT KINDS— THE TRUE 
WAY TO BUY, ROAST, AND MAKE 
IT. 

Recipes No. 9 and 10 gives directions how 
to make coffee, but this article will give 
more information upon the subject, wliich is 
important to every family. 

We are very fond of coffee, and that of 
the best quality. We have used Mocha, Afri- 
can, Java, Rio, Maracaibo, and many others, 
both male and female, plain and mixed. For 
years we have experimented with coffee 
and coffee pots of every kind and quality, 
patented, and the old way so much used — 
boiling. The results of all this we now 
give to tlie public, and we assure all who 
will try our mode of buying, roasting, mak- 
ing, and preparing it to drink, that they will 
never use any other plan. 

690. How to Buy Coffee. 

Always buy it green (or unroasted)at whole- 
sale, as it will keep green for a year if kept 
in a dry, clean place, in a good, tight box. 
If bought at retail buy it green, as you can 
see what you purchase, and are more likely 
to get the best article. 

691. Mocha Coffee. 

Mocha coffee is the best, but very expen- 
sive, being nearly double the price of Java ; 
the flavor is very delicate and fine, and but 
few stores keep it ; at times there is not a 
ton in New York City. 

692. African Coffee. 

This is similar in flavor to Mocha, and, 
like it, scarce and hard to procure. The 
male berry is the finest flavor. 

693. Real Java Coffee. 

For general use tliis is the best ; it can 
always be had, and we like it nearly as well 
as Mocha. It has* a fine flavor, but much 
that is sold for Java is not so. 

694. Maracaibo Coffee 

Stands next in order of quality, and ia 
cheaper than the other kinds, a little stronger 
flavor, and does not waste so much in roast- 
ing. Many persons like it. 

695. St. Domingo Coffee. 

This is another cheap coffee, but very 
good for family nse. It is stronger than 
Java. 

696. Rio Coffee. 

This is the strongest and cheapest in the 
market, and is used largely in the south and 
west. Many persons are fond of it. 



697. Coffee made from Grain, etc. 

Many substitutes have been used, such as 
rye, peas, corn, wheat, barley, dandelion, 
roots, chickory, and other articles of various 
kinds, yet nothing can be made that wiU in 
reality take its place. Nature intended 
coffee to be made into a beverage and 
nothing else ; it is good for nothing else, but 
it is good for that ; and all the artificial sub- 
stitutes, separately or together, will not make 
a good, liealthy cup of coffee. 

698. How to Roast Coffee. 

Roast once a week, and keep it in a close 
glass jar, tin can, or tight vessel. 

Roast it until it is of a good deep uniform 
brown color (or buy it the same color). A 
cylinder, of which there are several kinds in 
the market, is better than a pan ; spread it 
out on a pan to cool. Coffee swells one 
third after roasting, and loses about one- 
eighth or more in weight. 

699. To Grind Coffee. 

Never grind it until about to use it, as the 
flavor evaporates rapidly. 

When Bekney's Cofee Cone is used, 
grind the coffee as fine as possible ; but for 
other vessels grind coarse. The CONE is 
intended to get all the strength at once, 
therefore the coffee must be ground to a fine 
powder. 

670. To make Coffee the Right Way. 

We have tried every way, and have come 
to the conclusion that the only way to make 
it is with Berney's Coffee Cone ; and it 
is a very simpk, very easy, and a very quick 
way, saving nearly half the coffee, and al- 
ways having it hot, fresh, clear, and strong ; 
saving all that fine delicate flavor which de- 
lights the palate, and is so exhilarating, re- 
freshing and stimulating. 

Coffee should never be boiled ; it is 
a crude, improper way. Grind it to a fine 
powder, and put the quantity required in 
the Cone, pour on the boiling hot water, 
and the coffee is made ; but first place the 
Cone in an earthen, crockery, or glass 
pitcher, or tea-pot. The coffee will come 
through as clear as brandy in a minute. 
Another thing, you can make it strong or 
weak as you may desire, as the coffee is 
ground to a powder, the boiling water 
passes through all of it and carries all the 
strength with it. If you wish to weaken it, 
add more water to the coffee. We make it 
very strong, and reduce it with hot milk 
instead of water 

671. To make Coffee the Wrong Way. 

Boil it and spoil it at once, for you drive 
the aroma up stairs ; by using, the machine 
coffee-pots you merely waste money, time, 
and coffee. 



MEDICAL PROPERTIES OF COFFEE.

672. How the Coffee Cone was Invented. 

The inventor, being extravagantly fond of 
coffee, bad tried nearly all tbe so-called im- 
proved coffee-pots, but they all bad faults. 
Some of tbese were used to boil tbe coffee 
in, some to boil and filter it, and otbers only 
to strain it, — but all of tbem were made of 
Tin. Now tbe cooks, in using tbem, would 
set them to boiling; and many times an 
hour before it was wanted. Again, they 
would grind tbe coffee coarse, and deluge it 
with water, and as it must be cooked and be 
ready for tbe family, they generally got 
slops. Again, the cook would leave the 
coffee grounds to remain in the pot, or wash 
it out with cold water, leaving some of the 
old coffee to remain in ; this would spoil the 
good coffee. If any doubt it, try it and see. 

The result was such as to determine Mr. 
Berney to invent the Cone, so that he could 
have it made in a minute, on bis dining- 
table, in a pitcher ; no boiling away of the 
strength and aroma ; no spoilt coffee by 
dirty pots, but fresh, pure, clear, and 

STRONG coffee, WITH ALL THE DELICATE 
FLAVOR PRESERVED. 

MEDICINAL PROPERTIES OF COFFEE. 

There are many medicinal virtues in 
coffee. It cures 

Indigestion. — When taken in modera- 
tion it is a gentle stimulus to the digestive 
organs. 

Headache. — It relieves some forms of 
headache. 

Fatigue and Exhaustion. — It is excel- 
lent when a person is fatigued or exhausted. 

Drunkenness. — Very strong coffee will 
cure drunkenness. Many fashionable bar- 
rooms keep it made for that purpose. It is 
eminently useful to cure the habitual 
drinker, or those who wish to cure them- 
selves of the habit of using intoxicating 
liquors. 

Wakefulness. — It will keep any one 
awake, and therefore should not be drank 
last before going to bed. 

Bad Taste or Breath.— It vrill take 
away the disagreeable taste from a persons 
mouth, and for a time a bad breath. 

Diarrhcea, Dysentery. — In gome per- 
sons it will check diarrhcBa and dysentery. 

Stlmulants. — As a stimulant to the brain 
it is used by many persons. It renders it 
more active, and enriches the mind with 
ideas. 



Pkofessor Blot, Founder of the New York 
Cooking Academy, etc., on Making Coffee : — 

" There are several ,i(ood filters, but the major 
ity of people find them too complicated for 
daily use. Good coffee cannot be made in a 
utensil often, but wrongly, called a coflTee pot, 
which is nothing but a pot. With such a 
utensil the coffee must be boiled, and as no 



liquor can be boiled without allowing the 
steam to escape, and the steam, made by boil- 
ing coffee, being its aroma, therefore, the best 
part of the coffee is evaporated, before it is 
served." 



Mrs. a. B. Hill, "Authoress of Housekeep- 
ing Made Easy," etc., remarks: — 

"That after being made, coffee loses every 
moment some of its delightful aroma. The 
coffee-pot should always be kept clean, well 
scalded, and scoured after each boiling. It is 
the practice of slovenly, careless cooks, to 
leave the grounds from time to time in the 
boiler, and when the vessel is needed, empty 
and hastily rinse it, leaving much of the former 
contents adhering to the sides. The result of 
such management is, that the coffee, instead of 
being the deliciously exhilarating drink it might 
be, is flat, insipid, muddy, and absolutely per- 
nicious." 

And such is the case — the old coffee adher- 
ing to the sides, spoils all the good put in it. — 
Editor. 



Dr. John King, the celebrated Head of the 
the Eclectic Medical Fraternity in the West, 
says : — 

" If made, or heat applied, or boiled too long, 
coffee becomes unpleasantly bitter. Tbe sooner 
it is used after it is made, the more agreeable 
and stimulating it will prove, as it rapidly 
loses its most desirable jDroperties by being 
kept. 

" Taken in moderation, it is a gentle stimu- 
lus to the digestive apparatus. Strong coffee 
is an excellent antidote for opium or strong 
liquors. Coffee is useful in many cases — a 
valuable cordial restorative after exhaustion and 
fatigue, as well as to cure drunkenness. It 
should, however, never be used to excess." 



Dr. Warren, of Boston, says : — 

"Good coffee prevents the waste and ex- 
haustion of the body, but it must be used as 
soon as made." 

Coffee made hy this invention (the Coffee 
Cone) is clear and free from all grounds ; and, by 
its cone shape, it fits any silver-plated or stone- 
china table pot, or pitcher. The cone sliape 
also extracts all the strength from the coffee. 
The poorest, yet most common plan of making 
coffee is to boil it ; yet no one who understands 
the nature of coffee, or any thing of the eatable 
or drinkable kind, would allow the odor to 
escape. A kitchen should be as free from 
odor of any kind as the parlor. 



Mr. Soter, the great French Cook, says : — 
"Filtering is the only way to make coffee." 

We might fill this book with just such arti- 
cles fromeminent physicians and cooks, in re- 
lation to coffee. 

As coffee costs so much now it is important 
to make it right, and we give the only true way 
that it can be made.

PLEASANT AND REFRESHING DRINKS. 



PLEASANT AND 
REFRESHING DRINKS. 

We all know tliat a cool drink in sum- 
mer, and a stimulating one at any time, is 
delightful ; to supply that want, many, too 
many adulterated poisonous drinks are 
made, to injure and destroy the body. We 
give a sample of them in another 
page ; but the recipes here will enable 
families to make their own beverages cheap, 
pure, and good. 

Pure wine is strengthening and good 
to drink. The publisher of this work 
saved his life twice by the use of it. In 
moderation it will harm no one ; but the 
difficulty is to get pure wine, but the re- 
cipes will enable those who desire them to 
do so. 

703. Raisin Wine. 

Time. — To stand twelve days. 

Articles. — Five pounds of raisins to a 
gallon of water. 

Directions. — Take the raisins, pick them 
from the stalks, and chop them very small ; 
then put them into a tub, and pour over them 
hot soft water. Let this be strained twice 
or thrice every day for twelve days succes- 
sively, then pour the liquor into a cask, 
make a toast of bread, and while it is hot 
spread it on each side with yeast, and put it 
into the vessel. It will be fit to drink in 
four months. 

704. Superior Ginger Wine. 

Time — Fit to bottle in three montlis. 

Articles. — One pound of Jamaica ginger ; 
fifty-six pounds of loaf sugar ; six dozen 
lemons ; two bottles of brandy ; eighteen 
gallons of water; two table-spoonfuls of 
new yeast. 

Directions. — Take the best Jamaica gin- 
ger, slice it very thin, and tie it in a cloth. 
Boil it with the sugar and the water for 
three quarters of an hour, skimming it all 
the time. Pare the lemons very thin, and 
pour the boiling liquor over the peels, let it 
stand until the next day, then stir in the 
juice of the lemons, and put it into the 
cask with the ginger and the yeast. Stir all 
well together and let it stand until it has 
done working ; then add the brandy and 
bung it up close. It will be fit to bottle in 
three months. 

705 Currant Wine. 

Articles. — To every gallon of currants, 
one gallon of water, three pounds and a 
half of moist sugar ; and a gill of brandy. 

Directions. — To every gallon of juice, 
put the same quantity of cold water, and 
three and a half pounds of moist sugar. 



Put it into your cask, reserving some of the 
liquor for filling up. Put the cask in a 
warm, dry place, and the liquor will ferment 
of itself. When the fermentation is over, 
skim off the refuse, and fill up the cask 
with the reserved liquor. When it has 
ceased working pour one gill of brandy to 
six gallons of wine. Bung it up close for 
eight or nine months, then bottle it off clear. 
Run the sediment through a jelly bag until 
it is clear ; bottle it and keep it twelve 
months before it is used. 

706. Orange Wine. 

Time — To stand four days. 

Articles. — Seventy-five oranges, ; thirty 
pounds of loaf sugar ; one bottle of brandy ; 
six eggs ; eight gallons of water.

whites and the shells of the eggs well 
beaten, into a copper, and let the whole 
gently boU as long as any scum jises. Peel 
the oranges very thin, put the peels into a 
tub, and ]X)ur over them the boiling clarified 
sugar ; cover it over and let it stand for four 
days. On the third day, squeeze the oranges 
and strain the jmce through a hair sieve, 
letting it drain until the next day, then 
pour it into a cask and fill it up with the 
clarified sugar, keeping back all the peels of 
the oranges. If not sufficient to fill the 
cask, boil some water, and when cold add 
it ; then pour in the brandy, and stop it 
down close. In twelve months cask it off, 
and return it to the cask. 

If not fine add a little isinglass. 

707. Mulled Wine. 

Time — Mve mimttes. 

Articles. — One quart of new milk ; one 
stick of cinnamon ; nutmeg ; and sugar, to 
taste ; yolks of six eggs ; a spoonful or two 
of cream.

minutes in a Tea-kettle Boiler with a 
stick of cinnamon, nutmeg, and sugar to 
your taste ; then take it off the fire, and let 
it stand to cool. Beat the eggs well, 
and mix them with the cream, then mix it 
with the wine, and pour it backwards and 
forwards from the saucepan to the jug 
several times. 

708. Cider Wine. 

Ten or more gallons of cider fresh from 
the press, add two pounds of good brown 
sugar to each gallon. When the sugar has 
dissolved, strain the mixture into a clean 
cask. Let the cask want one gallon of being 
full. Leave out the bung for forty-eight 
hours ; then put in the bung, leaving a little 
vent until fermentation ceases ; then bung 
up tightly. In one year it is fit for use. 
It needs no straining, the longer it stands 
upon the lees the better. 



zL. 



709. Tomato Wine. 

Let the tomatoes be fully ripe. After 
mashing well let them stand twenty-four 
hours. Then strain, and to every quart of 
the juice, add one pound of good sugar. 
Let it ferment again, skimming frequently ; 
when clear, bottle. To use this, sweeten a 
glass of water to the taste, and add the 
tomato wine imtil sufficiently acid. 

710. Egg Wine. 

Tdie — About Jive minutes. 

Akticles. — One glass of white wine ; one 
spoonful of cold water ; a few lumps of loaf 
sugar ; a little grated nutmeg ; one egg. 

Directions. — Put a glass of white wine 
with half a wineglass of cold water, a little 
sugar and grated nutmeg into a Teakettle 
Boiler, set it over the fire, and when it 
boils pour it by degrees over an egg, well 
beaten with a spoonful of cold water, stir it 
one way for a minute, and serve it with dry 
toast in a plate. 

711. Elderberry Wine. 

To ten quarts of berries put five quarts 
of water, and let stand twenty-four hours. 
Then skim and strain it, and to every gallon 
of the liquor put three pounds of sugar, 
half an ounce of cloves, one ounce of cin- 
namon, and two ounces of ginger. Boil it 
again, and ferment it by putting in a slice 
of toast covered with fresh yeast. By leav- 
ing out the spices this is said to resemble 
port. 

712. Gooseberry Champagne. 

Select large full-grown berries, before they 
begin to turn red. Allow a gallon of water 
to every three pounds of fruit. Put the 
berries in a clean tub, pour on a little water, 
poimd and mash the fruit, then add the re- 
mainder of the water, and stir the whole 
well. Cover the tub with a clean cloth and 
let it stand four days. Stir it frequently 
and thoroughly ; then strain the liquor 
through a jelly bag or coarse linen cloth, 
and to each gallon add four pounds of white 
sugar ; and to every five gallons one quart 
of the best French brandy ; mix the whole, 
and put it into a clean cask that %vill just 
hold it, as the cask should be full. Place 
the cask in a cool, dry place, and lay the 
bung in loosely. Secure the cask firmly, so 
that it cannot be shaken or moved, as the 
least disturbance will injure the wine. Let 
it work for two weeks, or more, until the 
fermentation is subsided. Then bottle it, 
and be careful to drive the corks in tightly ; 
lay the bottles on their sides, and in six 
months the wine wOl be fit for use. 

713. Beer. 

To four gallons of water take two pounds 
of sugar, one quart of molasses, half a tea- 



cupful of finger, one pint of sots, two 
spoonfuls ot cream of tartar, one and a half 
spoonfuls of ground allspice, and three drops 
of oil of sassafras. Put the spices into bags, 
heat the water and pour it over the spices, 
mis the whole of the ingredients in an open 
vessel, let it stand over night, then skim off 
the top of the liquid, take out the bags of 
spices, and pour it carefully into jugs, bottles, 
or a keg. It will be fit for use in twenty, 
four hours. 

714. Ginger Beer. 

Time — One hour to boil. 

Articles. — Five pounds of loaf sugar ; 
three ounces of powdered ginger ; three 
gallons of water ; five lemons ; a quarter

in three gallons of water for one "hour. 
When it is cold add the juice and peels of 
five lemons, and a quarter of a tea-cupful of 
yeast on a slice of toasted bread. Let it 
stand in a tub covered with a thick cloth 
for two or three days. Then strain it 
through a thick cloth and bottle it. It will 
be ready to drink in four or five days after 
it is bottled. If wished to be very strong 
of ginger, more may be added. 

715. Spruce Beer. 

Pour eight gallons of cold water into a 
barrel, to this add eight gallons of boiling 
water, then put in six table-spoonfuls of 
essence of spruce, and sixteen pounds of 
molasses. When sufficiently cold add half 
a pint of yeast, and roll the cask about and 
shake it well. Keep it in a warm place for 
two days, with the bung open ; by this 
time the fermentation will have subsided 
sufficiently for bottling. Bottle it or put it 
in stone jars well corked, and it will be fit 
for use in a week. 

716. Cranberryade. 

Pour boiling water upon bruised cran- 
berries, let them stand for a few hours, 
strain off the liquor, and sweeten to the 
taste. This forms an agreeable and refresh- 
ing beverage. 

717. Appleade.

BISCUITS. 



We present, on this page, tlie cu- 
rious monogram of L.F.E., witli sev- 
eral biscuit recipes,sent to us by Hall

AND MaNUEACTUREES OF LuBIN's 

Flavor Extracts, rublishers of the 
celebrated Metropolitan Hotel Keci- 
pes. No. 218 Greenwich Street, New- 
York City. These celebrated extracts 
are excellent, and made from the 
fruits and nuts they represent. Fami- 
lies cannot bo too careful in using extracts, and 



Lf 



we would advise none to be used because thoy 
are cheap, or from unknown persons, who make 
imitations, which can be made from oils, vitriols, 
and other chemicals. The house of Hall & Euc- 
kel is too well known for their uprightness, 
straightforward and lionorable character, to be 
guilty of using any thing in their Cooking Ex- 
tracts but the genuine. We have tried and used 
them in our recipes, and recommend others so 
to do. Any thing needed in the drug line will 
be cheerfully attended to by them.

JELLY ICE-CREAMS. 



JELLY ICE-CREAMS. 

On pages 13, 13, 103, and 104 will be 
found many recipes for making Ice-Creams, 
etc. Since those were published we have 
experimented vnih various other articles of 
food, to cheapen and give more of a variety 
of these delicate and deservedly popular 
luxuries. 

It has been the custom to improve the 
Freezers by every means possible, but no 
effort has been made to cheapen and im 
prove the creams. 

The closer we have examined this subject 
the more we see the importance of our 
experiments, and the result has been such 
as to reduce the expense of fine creams so 
that they can be made from ten to fifteen 
cents per quart. 

The OLD WAY OP MAKING IcE-CREAH 
is with cream or milk, sugar, essence, a large 
number of eggs. This plan made a fair, 
but expensive ice-cream. If milk was used 
the result was a course ice-cream, full of 
lumps of ice. What is required is a smooth 
rich cream, at a, small expense : in order 
to do this we had to reduce the water to a 
jelly with the aid of new and cheap foods, 
so that the icy granules would not be 
formed. By our recipes this has been ac- 
complished, and the cheapest, richest, 
smoothest, finest, most nutritious and 
healthiest ice-creams ever made, are now 
given to the public. 

753. Jelly Ice-Creams. 

Are made by reducing gelatineous animal 
and vegetable preparations to a jelly and 
adding sugar, eggs, and flavoring to taste. 
They are superior to any other. 

754. Light Jelly Ice-Creams. 

Those wishing to have them light should 
eat them aa soon as made. 

755. To Improve Creams. 

After they are made draw off the water 
from the wooden freezers, pack it full of 
broken ice and salt, take out the dasher if 
you have one in the tin part, scrape off the 
cream that adheres to the sides, cover it 
over with the cover, then pack any old 
blankets, or any other cloth covers, around 
the whole freezer, let it stand for two or 
three hours or longer, and it will be hard, 
rich, and smooth. Packed with salt and 
ice it will keep hard as long as desired. 

We prefer condensed milk to make these 
creams, although common milk will do. 
We give the recipes for common milk. If 
condensed milk is used, use one part mjlk 
und three parts water.

RICH ICE-CREAMS. 



Fbaser, Bell & Loughean, -zi'.i 
Peakl Steeet, New York City, 
Manufacturers of Tin War e — 
whose bouse uud goods we recom- 
mend to the trade for the unsurpassed 
qualities ot'their goods, iis well as their 
honorable and just dealings, so that 
those purchasing tin ware wholesale 
should call upon them before purchas- 
ing elsewhere — present us with an il- 
lustration of the " American Patent 
Freezer," also, ice-cream receipts. 
We iiave repeatedly written that ice- 
creams, when slowly eaten, are 
healthy. We have made it from two 
to four times a week, and have given 
it freely to the whole family, includ- 
ing four children and a babe a year 
old, in a hot summer, and it has never 
disagreed with any of them. We state 
this fact, as many persons are under 
the impression that creams and ices 
are unhealthy. No cheaper or better 
luxury can be made. 

The old method of freezing involved hours of 
really hard work of whirling by hand the com- 
mon freezer. With the moclern inventions, it is 




but a few minutes' easy exercise, 
which a child can do. "We sliall in 
other issues give additional receipts 
for freezing ; and we know of no 
better machine than the "American 
Freezer" to do it in. 

To those who are compelled to re- 
niain in the city during the summer, 
its use is almost a necessity ; even 
during the colder months it is a deli- 
cacy tnat is pleasant. Try our recipes. 
These recipes are rich and delicious 
in flavor, and, of course, cost more 
than the common or jelly creams; but 
we cater for all classes. 

OBSERVATIONS ON FREEZING CREAM. 

In freezing ice-cream, the substance 
to be frozen should always be cold be- 
fore putting it in the freezer, as it 
saves ice. 

Use any common salt — not rock 
salt, as rock salt settles to the bottom 
of the tub. 

Break the ice fine ; a good way is to put it in a 
coarse sack, and break it with a" mallet or round 
billet of wood.

MAIZENA.

MAIEENA. 



DuKYEAs' Glen Cove 
Staboh Co jipant — De- 
pot AND Office, 49 
& 51 Pabk Place, 
New Yoek City. — 
DuRTEAs' Trademark 
adorns this pai^e, as 
well as some oi their 
recipes. No company 
of men have done more 
to elevate American 
manufactures of foods 
than they. 

Indian corn,, or maize, 
embodies many delica- 
cies and substantials 
necessary to life and 
happiness, and it is 
due to the Brothers 
Duryea that they 
should be credited, 
not only with medals, 
which they have, but 
with the patronai;e of 

the public. We know that much of the un- 
willingness of wives and cooks to use corn 
starch, maizenaj and other farinaceous foods 
has been from its great liability to burn, and 
the constant watching necessary to prevent 



its scorching. Now all 
this is obviated by 
cooking in the Tea- 
kettle' Boiler. If the 
reader desires a deli- 
cate, yet hearty food, 
use Durtea's Maize- 
NA and Corn Starches. 
They also make 
Starches for Laundry 
use, fine, white, and 
strong. They only re- 
(^uire one trial to sat^ 
isfy any one of their 
strength, purity, and 
goodness, giving a 
gloss to the clotlies. 
All grocers ought to 
keep them. There are 
some grocers so preju- 
diced against any 
change, as to not keep 
a variety of the same 
goods. This is a mis- 
take. Some families will have every kind. It 
is therefore the interest of storekeepers to have 
a variety of every thing good. And among these 
goods should always be kept Duryeas'. Give 
them one trial : it is all they ask.

PREPARED (^OCOANUT. 



Thk New York 
Desiccating Com- 
pany, Office and 
Warehouse, No. 70 
Murray street, New 
York city, N. Y., 
sends us the fol- 
lowing recipes, by 
wliicli their Pre- 
pared CoCOANUTC:m 
be made into rich, 
healthy, and cheap 
puddings, pies, 
cakes, etc. This 
article possesses all 
the richness and 
delicate flavor of 
the green cocoanut. 
It will keep in any 
climate, requires no 
labor to prepare 
it, as the whole 
nuts do, as it is fine- 
ly ground, and put 
up in pound and 
half a pound pa- 
pers. This is an 
entirely new patent 
preparation. All 
who have used it, 
praise it, and con- 
tinue its use. In 
boiling prepared co- 
coanut, it IS liable 
to burn if not cook- 
ed in a water bath, 




or a Tea-kettle 
Boiler. 

There is nothing 
richer than Pre- 
pared Cocoanut that 
we know of. A 
little of it in corn 
starch, maizena, 
farina, manioca, 
samp, cassava, sago, 
rice flour, tapioca or 
arrowroot, imparts 
all that delightful 
flavor, which is pe- 
culiar to cocoanut 
to a quantity of the 
above articles. We 
hope those who 
have not tried Pre- 
pared Cocoanut will 
do so. Be sure and 
take none except that 
advertised in tfds 
Magazine, as we rec- 
ommend Homarb'sor 
company'' s goods un- 
til we have tried them 
Health and life is 
too precious a boon 
to trifle with, by 
using inferior arti- 
cles prepared by 
imscrupulous men. 
We wish auyperson 
who are in doubt 
what to use, to 
write to us, and we 



will cheerfully inform them of the best, the names of the parties manufacturing or selling them, 
the prices, and where to get them. This Cocoanut can be purchased of all the grocers in the land.

TAPIOCA FARINA. 



89 



Bt the coubtest of 
E. C. Hazakd, Esq., 
No. 6y Bakclay Street, 
New Yobk City, In- 
ventor AND Patentee 
OF Tapioca Fabina, and 
Dealer in Farinaceous 
Goods (especially 
Hominy and Samp), and 
Fine Foreign Grocer- 
ies. — Hazard's Fariua is 
made from the roots of 
the Cassava Plant of 
Brazil (as shown in the 
trade mark), and is a 
healthy and nutritious 
food. It can be made 
into excellent Puddings, 
Jellies, Blanc Manges, 
Ice-C reams. Souffles, 
and other dishes for 
both sicli and well. The 
handy and convenient 
shape it is manufactured 
into, and being put up 
in pound and halt- 
pouud packages, render 
it desirable. Tapioca 
Farina is a cheap luxury. 
It swells enormously in 
cooking, absorbing a 
large amount of water, 
and is not costly. Its 



TAPIOCA FARINA. 




It is easily cooked, 
strengthening, noii- 



heatingj non-irritating 
properties make it valu- 
able. Give it a trial in 
some of the recipes here 
given, and ahearty meal 
or dessert can be made 
from it. The inventor 
of Farina from Tapioca, 
deserves credit for his 
ingenuity in prepnring 
it in the style he does; 
and every man who ren- 
ders any article of food 
more valuable to the 
people than it is in a 
crude state, is a public 
benefactor. 

Tapioca-Farina, when 
cooking, is ven,- liable 
to burn; to prevent 
which, cook it in a Tea- 
kettle Boiler, and it 
will be very easy to 
prepare it for the table. 

We shall in our future 
issues give a variety of 
recipes to cook this and 
healthy luxurious food. 

Nature has been 
bountiful in her gifts to 
man, and he should miprove the piepaiation of 
them as much as possible.

MILK CAKES. 



CONDENSED MILK. 




The New York 
Condensed Milk 
Co. ; Depot, 34 & 
86 Elizabeth St., 
and 227 and 229 E. 
Thirty-Fourth St., 
New Yobk — Gail 
BoEDEN, Esq., the 
successful inventor 
of Condensed Milk, Prest. — supplies the cities of 
New York, Brooklyn, and Jersey City with pure 
Condensed Milk, sweet and fresh, from their 
wagons, every day, at Forty cents per quart, and 
they give an "honest quart, measured by our Tea 
Kettle Boileb Measure, which we know to be 
a correct standard. Those not accustomed to the 
use of Condensed Milk may think it a very high 
price, but we assure them it is the cheapest milk 
sold in the city. The common milk is sold at 
ten cents a quart, condensed at forty cents a 
quart. Add four quarts of water to one quart of 
Condensed Milk, and you have five quarts of bet- 
ter milk than is sold at ten cents a quart. The 
fact that over ten thousand families in the cities 
of New York, Brooklyn, and Jersey City are us- 
ing it, ought to satisfy any person that there are 



some reasons why 
they prefer it to 
common milk. 

Milk can be pur- 
chased in the coun- 
try much cheaper 
than it can be here. 
Transportation of 
80 per cent, of the 
water Mr. Borden thought useless, and by 
years of patient toil he has perfected the machin- 
ery to take out the water, leaving all the sub- 
stance. By adding water, it is again milk. 

There is no article of diet in the whole list of 
them which a mother should be more particular 
about than milk, simply because it is the natural 
food of children, and one wliich they love. That 
the New York Condensed Milk Co.'s milk, and 
the Eagle Brand of Canned Milk is pure, we have 
not a doubt. That it is cheaper, purer, and bet- 
ter than the average of city milk, we know, and 
we unhesitatingly recommend its use. The 
prices are for the summer in New York. 

In the recipes heluw it 'is meant to use Condensed 
Milk without any water. If, however, plain milk 
is iised, add a little butter.

twenty-six pounds tliirteen ounces of tliis 
excellent bread, which keeps moist and 
sweet longer than that made by the ordi- 
nary process. 

825. New Year's Calce. 
From Mrs. A. C, Brooklyn, N. Y. 
Seven pounds of flour, two pounds ot 
stigar, three pounds of butter, one pint of 
water, caraway seeds, if you v.ish. 

826. Sweetmeats. 

Prom Mrs. M. M. C, of Chicago, III. 

If sweetmeats are boiled too long, they 
lose their flavor, and become a dark color ; 
if boiled too short a time, they will not keep 
well. Sweetmeats should be kept in glass 
jars, or in those of white queensware,"in a 
cool place. Look at them every two weeks, 
as they may sour ; if so, scald them.

^^^rV 



Some months ago we determined to issue a Quarterly Maga- 
zine, full of useful knowledge, to benefit mankind, and to devote 
each number to a special object. The first number we designed to con- 
tain Cooking and Household Recipes. We knew that the stores were 
filled with cook books, varying in price from fifty cents to five dollars. We 
bought copies of all for sale, and, after a careful examination of them, 
we found that they were simply copies of each other, with a slight varia- 
tion of the contents. They were also extravagant in the articles to be 
cooked. No arrangement of Time, Articles, Directions, or abvice as 
TO WHAT GOODS WERE THE CHEAPEST TO USE. Many trials of the recipes 
proved them failures. But how to remedy this evil ? We determined to get 
an old, experienced housekeeper to edit this department, to procure the tried 
recipes of families who knew them to be good, and to practice on those that we thought 
to be good imtU they were made perfect. This was a work of much labor and research — 
months of time were spent in compiling this number. It is a very simple matter to edit a 
common magazine of stories, songs, and news, compared with this labor, for here every 
recipe is sooner or later tried by thousands of families, and if not correct, not only is the 
book thrown aside as useless, but much food is wasted, and disappointment and vexation 
experienced. Over Eleven Thousand copies were sold in four weeks. 

A New Feature op the Mystery is the classifying of foods and useful manufac- 
tures in one, two, or more columns, with recipes for using them, so that any person wish- 
ing to cook a dish with any article which is named in a column, can do so with ease. Also 
common articles of household use, such as potash, benzine, etc., have their uses explained. 
We have divided No. 1 into three parts, so that all parties can be suited. Those who 
-wish nothing but Cooking Recipes can have them ; those who wish all, can be accommo- 
dated with them, or any part. We shall improve this book until it is perfect, and no 
household should be without it. The Medical Number will be issued January 1st, 1869. 
To our Advertising Patrons we return thanks. We know that their advertise- 
ments are not misplaced — that we give value for every dollar paid us, and that many of 
them appreciate our magazine as a means of advertising. Several of them continue in 
this and other editions, and a large firm, Duryea's Maizena and Starch Co., 49 & 51 Park 
Place, New York City, keep their advertisement in all the numbers of The Mystery, even 
though it be half a million copies ; which number we hope to reach, and shall, it energy 
and perseverance will do it. F. G. Smith & Co., manufacturers of Bradbury Pianos, have 
contracted to advertise in Seventy-five Thousand copies. Other firms advertise m many 
thousand copies. . , , .7, 

Advertisers are cautioned aqaind paying for any advertisement unless a printed bill 
is presented from this office, loitJi our Trade-Mark on it. Likewise, as several complaints have 
been made to us of persons being swindld by paying for subscriptions, and orders for books 
a?id goods, without receiving them, at the time,' we desire to state that we sell the magazines 
and articles to canvassers and dealers at wholesrde prices, and never, _ tinder any circum- 
stances, give persons power to collect money for books or goods unless delivered.

New York, Oct. 7,(itK 1867. 
A. Brbnev, Esq. — ^Dear Sir: Mrs. R. has used the Tea- 
Kettle Boiler now two months, and desires me to say that 
it is the best invention ever made to assist the cook in 
preparing all kinds of food liable to boil over or burn— in 
fact, it does every thing you claim for it. Yours, truly, 

E. RUSSELL. 



Bergen, N»w Jersey, Feb. \2th, 1868.

your Patent Tea-Kettle Boilers. I use it all the time, 
and would not be without it for ten times its cost. 

MRS. HASLET. 



QreerwiUe, New Jersey, March Wi, 1868. 
A. Bbbnet. — Dear Sir : After a fair trial of your Patent 
Tea-Kettle Boiler, I must say it is one of the best assist- 
ants a cook can have — it cannot be beat. Tours, resp'y, 
E. E. EVERETT. 



New York, March Zdth, 1868. 
Mr. Bernet.— Your Tea-Kettle Boiler is the perfection 
of an Anti-Burning Boiler. Beats Hecker's, and all Dou- 
ble Boilers. H. A. BRAFORD. 



New York, ApHl Id, 1868. 
Alfred Beenet. Esq. — I think your Tea-Kettle Boiler 
ought to be in every kitchen. The wife and cook's work 
is hard enough, and every labor-saving machine is a bless- 
ing, and should be used. I have never seen a more com- 
pete anti-burning and boiling-over boiler than the Tea- 
Kettle Boiler. Its shape and size make it useful in many 
ways. The price is so low that it can be bought even by 
the poorest families. May you aell hundreds of thousands 
of them. Yours, very truly, MRS. S. S R.

Mr. A. Bernet. — Dear Sir: We have used your won- 
derful Tea-Kettle Boiler in our family for three months, 
and would not be without it for ten times its value. 

We find it the best invention we ever saw for Boiling 
Milk, Ice Cream, Farina, Oysters, and many others that 
would be sure to burn if exposed to the hot coals. I would 
recommend every fomily to have one in the house. 

W. H. PEEK 



Jersey City, New Jemey, May \Ath, 1868. 
No. 170 South-Sixth St. 
Mr. A. Bernkt. — Dear Sir: I have seen your Tea- 
Kettle Boiler in use at my boarding-house for over a year, 
and all the cooks that have used it pronounce it the best 
cooking utensil they have ever used. It saves the time 
they previously spent in watching those kinds of food 
likely to burn. In fact, the use of the Boiler proves that 
it does all you claim for it. O. DUTTON. 



COOK'S EVIDENCE IN FAVOR OP THE 
TEA-KETTLE BOILER. 

Corner Rahway Avenue and Cherry Street. 
ElUsabeth, New Jersey, May \st, 1868. 
A. Bebnet, Esq.— Your Tea-Kettle Boiler is the very 
best anti-burning boiler ever invented, and every family, 
rich and poor, ought to use them. The one we use has, 
in one year, saved its cost ten times over. The poor, 
hard-working cooks ought to insist on the family they 
work for, buying one, or buy it themselves. 

LOUISE KITTMAR, Cook. 

No cook will use any thing else to boil Milk, Corn 
Starch, or any thing likely to burn. B. RUNNETT. 



I would advise every cook to buy one if the family will 
not. LOUISE IIEINDRICkS. 



The mcst troublesome things to cook are Milk, Corn 
Starch, and such food as is likely to burn. Hecker's 
Boilers burn out very quick , but your Boilers now m.ike 
the Corn Starch, Farina, Tapioca, Hominy, Samp, Rice, 
etc., the ^he easiest things to cook. 

BRIDGET MURPHY. 



Mr. Bernet. — Here is a dollar for one of your Tea- 
Kettle Boilers. I am going to get married, and must have 
one. JULIA D B. 



It beats any thing to cook with in the kitchen, and 
every cook should refuse to work without a Tea-Kettle 
Boiler to aid her. MARGARET O'BRIEN. 



The blessings of all cooks will be showered down on yoti 
for inventing the Tea-Kettle Boiler. ANN McBRIDE. 



I have worked in families for twenty-seven years, but 
have never seen in any house so complete a cooking arti- 
cle as your Tea- Kettle Boiler. MRS. HAND. 

New York, July mh, 1868. 

A. Bebnet, Esq.— Dear Sir : My wife has used youi 
Tea-Kettle Boiler and find it answers every purpose you 
say it does. It cooks all kinds of farinaceous foods liable 
to burn, without burning, or any watching ; in fact, she 
does not see how any family can do without one, and ad- 
vises her friends to use them. Yours, truly,

New York, July Uth, 1868. 

A. Bebnet, Esq. — Dear Sir : I have used your new 
Patent Coffee Cone in my family, and find it makes 
clear, strong Coffee, saving fully one-third of the amount 
we formerly used. It makes it free from all grounds, and 
preserves all the aroma. I recommend every one to use 
them. It is all made in a few minutes. Yours truly,

July 20«A, 1888. J 
A. Bernet, Esq. — Dear Sir : I have used your Patent 
Coffee Cone a week. The first trial the girl put in the 
usual quantity. It was too strong, so much so that we 
could not drink it without weakening it. The next time 
we used two-thirds of the quantity we first used, and 
then it was stronger than the old way of boiling. The 
flavor was excellent, the coffee pure and free from 
grounds ; in fact, I never had good coffee until I used 
this Cone. Yours, etc..

A. Bernet, Esq.— Dear Sir : My wife has used some 
of the recipes for cooking, in the " Myatery of Living," 
and finds them correct, economical and good. The style 
of having the Time, Articles and Directions seperate, 
makes them handy and convenient. By the use of these 
recipes a family can reduce their expenses one-third. 
Your Tea-Kettle Boiler is the perfection of an anti- 
burning boiler. Nothing can burn in it, or be wasted or 
spoiled. Yours, truly, JOHN GLIVES. 



No. 445 Main St., Charlestown, Mass. \ 
July 8d, 1S68. f 
A. Bernet, Esq. — Dear Sir: I have used the recipes 
in the People's Book, " Mystery of Living," for a month, 
and would not be without it. They are practicable and 
perfect, good and useful, economical and saving, plain 
and sure to produce palatable dishes from the cheapest 
of foods. Certainly, no family should be without one, if 
they would live well and save money. Yours, truly,

Opinion of John Hecker, Esq., MANCFACTtiBEE o» 
Fabina, Inventor of Hecker's Boilkk. — The pub. 
lisher called upon Mr. Hecker, and showed him some 
fifty pages of the Mvstekt of Living. Mr. H. looked it 
over carefully, and said " It is the most practical, sen- 
sible, economical work on cooking I ever saw, and is 
just what is wanted for the million." He insisted on 
paying full price for h.ilf a book, saying it was cheap at 
that. He also pronounced the Tea-Kettlk Boiler the 
true boiler for cooking far inaceou.i foods.

INSTITUTE, 



Report of the Committee on Refrigerators, 

" The Zero Refrigerator is the best, not so much by possessing novel features of great 
merit, as by being an extremely well devised, effective, and economical construction. The prin- 
ciples it involves are long tested and approved. It preserves the meat and vegetables at a low 
temperature, with the consumption of less ice than any other known to us. 

("THOMAS D. STETSON, 
Committee. \ " JAMES B. OGDEN, 
( " IRA L. CADY." 

lE^ The Zero Refrigerator tvill retain a greater degree of cold, with less 
ice consumed, than any other Refrigerator yet invented. 



From the Cultivator and Country Oentleman, June, 1867. 

" Lesley's Refrigerator. — After a full trial we have found this Refrigerator a valuable 
household convenience. The ice is preserved in the central i»art ; and the inclosed shelves, on 
each side, receive articles of food, fruit, etc., which it is desired to protect from the heat of sum- 
mer and the cold of winter. It is a handsome piece of furniture, painted oak color, vnih. white 
porcelain knobs, and vpill grace the handsomest pantry or kitchen hall. The ice reservoir is a 
most convenient place for depositing this material, where it will keep from one to three days, 
according to the heat of the weather, maintaining a temperature in the adjoining apartments 
lower than that of the coldest cellars. We have never found anything to freeze in it in winter, 
and in making an experiment by placing it out of doors when the thermometer was 20° below 
freezing, found that a small cup of cold water required five hours for a thin film of ice to form, 
at the same time it froze in fifteen minutes if exposed." 

Judge Storer, of Cincinnati, Ohio, writes : " Your Refrigerator gives perfect satisfaction. 
It has preserved meats, vegetables, milk, and butter during the hottest months of our variable 
climate." 

" The Zero Refrigerator is grand ! excellent." — Prof. A. E. Thatcher. 

Dr. HAiiL, of " Hall's Journal of Health" says : " It is certainly an improvement on all others." 

" I think for cleanliness and convenience of use, it is much superior to anything of the kind 
made." — G. 8. Weaver, Albany, N. T. 

" Your Zero Refrigerator was in use during the hottest months of last simimer. I can safely 
lecommend it." — Mrs. James Brooks, Fifth Avenue.

THE AMERICAN 

ICE-C REAl FRE EZER. 

This Fi'eezer surpasses all others in ease in operating, rapidity of freez- 
ing, and evenness of cream frozen. By simply turning a cranky 
three essential operations are effected at once, viz.. The ice and salt is agi- 
tated, the frozen cream is scraped from the sides of the cylinder, and 
thoroughly mixed and beaten by the arms attached to the spindle, passing 
(as the crank is turned) between those on the scraper, thereby effectually 
preventing the formation of frozen lumps or irregularities, and producing 
cream unsurpassed for smoothness.

BRADBURY PIANO FORTES. 

Warerooms, 427 Broome Street, near Broadway, N. Y. 

These very popular instruments are recommended as embodying all the superior quali- 
ties of a first class Piano, by the most prominent of our leading artists. 

Having retired from tlie Piano-Forte business, Messrs. FREEBORN GAERETSON SMITH & CO. will succeed 
me, and for them I bespeak the patronage of my friends and the public. Mr. Smith has served a regular apprentice- 
ship in the T.arious branches of the Piano Forte business, and has been engaged in the first manufactories in New 
York and Boston. I can confidently recommend him as a gentleman in all respects qualified to succeed me in the 
manufacture of my first class Pianos, he having had the sole charge of my manufacturing department, as Superinten- 
dent, since 1S65, and having given entire satisfaction in that capacity. 

New York, jM^y 17, 1867. WM. B. BRADBURY. 




TRITJ^rPHAlVT SUCCESS. 

SEVEN FIRST PREMIUMS received within four weeks— Two Gold Medals, Oxe Silvee Medal, and Fouk 
DiPLO.M.\s — making in all Sevkn First Peemiums for State Fairs, for Wm. B. Bradbury's New Scale Piano Fortes, 
within the brief space of four weeks. 

The Two Gold Medals are from the Fair of the American" Ixstitdte, held at the Academy of Music in 
September. 1803, "for the best Piano Forte,'" and from the New .Jersey State Fair, held at Paterson, N. J., September, 
1S63, "for the Two Best Piano Fobtk.' 

Never, in the history of trade, were so many First Peemictms known to be given within so short a space of time. 

In addition to this, we have the strongest indorsements of nearly all the well-known musicians of New York, who 
have per.sonally and carefully examined our Pianos. We are also receiving similar testimonials from first class Teach- 
•ers ami Professors from other cities and towns. 

The testimonials from Gottschalk, Masos, Sanderson, Pattison, Berge, Zondell, Heller, Fradell, and 
others, were only given after thorough and repeated trials for several months. 

K. BONNER, Esq., Proprietor of the '^ Nno York Ledger^' thus writes in Hie " Ledger'"' of Jan. 1-3, 1SC6. 

"We bought one of Bradbury's instruments last spring, and after using it for several months, and hearing the 
opinions of some of the best judges in this city — persons who have tried it — we are confident that no better Piano 
could be made. We do not vvonder, therefore, that ' American Pianos are now at a premium in the markets of the 
Old World.' " 

THEODORE TILTON, Editor of the " Independent;' in a note to Jfr. Bradbury: 

" My Dear Mr. Bradbury, — 1 have had the beautiful Piano so long, that now to ask me how I like it, is like a.>k- 
ing me how I like one of my children ! In tact, if you were to ask thechildren, I'm afraid they would say they liked 
It nearly as well as they like me I It speaks every day, the year round, and never loses its voice. I wish its owner 
•jould <\i) h.ilf as well." 

We are rising the Bradbxtrt Pianos in our Families, and fhey give entire satisfaction.
