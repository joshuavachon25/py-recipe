PREFACE. 



This is a Cook Book by the people and for the people. The 
unpublished cooking lore of all sections of our vast country has 
been drawn upon liberally. By its use families of moderate 
means can get out of the ruts that lead to dyspepsia through the 
dead level of monotony. The gastronomic surprise that became 
so necessary to one of Balzac's characters can be obtained without 
the aid of a French chef. 

These menus were written by a large number of women scat- 
tered from ocean to ocean, and from the great lakes to the Gulf 
of Mexico. The larger part of them have been published in The 
Chicago Record, and although each was prepared without refer- 
ence to any other, it is hoped that the daily succession of dishes 
will be found satisfactory, both from an economic and a gastro- 
nomic point of view. An harmonious whole has been produced 
by inserting the necessary number of reserved manuscripts, and 
varying somewhat the order of original publication, so that in 
many cases the remnants from one day's meals supply dishes for 
the next; the roast, when sufficient is left for the following day, 
will be found to harmonize, cold, with the rest of the bill of fare, 
and may be substituted for the fresh meat given. 

The aim has been to furnish a great variety of pleasing and 
nutritious meals, daintily served, that may be used by families 
whose style of living does not exceed an annual expenditure in 
provisions of a hundred dollars for each person, where the family 
numbers four or five or more members. The three Holiday menus 
— New Year's Day, Thanksgiving and Christmas — are an exception 
in the matter of expense. The dinners on these occasions are ar- 
ranged for ten persons, and a cost of five dollars was permitted. 
All other meals and recipes allow for a family of five. The esti- 
mates of cost have been based on the actual state of the Chicago 
market. In future years the seasonable time for various articles 
may vary somewhat, or the prices may be higher. In such con- 
tingencies most of these menus can be cut down to the appropria-

tion, by those wishing to economize, and still leave an appetizing 
and wholesome dietary. They may likewise be expanded by the 
more luxurious. 

While a too slavish adherence in detail is not advised, it is 
hoped that the suggestions for a judicious rotation in diet may 
be a help to the experienced housewife as well as to the novice, 
and that she will find her formulae are not necessarily the best 
way of preparing the various dishes, but only one of a number of 
excellent ways, whose judicious alternation is best, both for the 
pleasure and the profit of the eating. 

Quantities of salt and pepper when originally left indefinite 
have been supplied in most instances. In doing this the seasoning 
has been keyed to the average taste, so that the dishes will be 
neither flat beyond redemption by cellar and shaker, nor offen- 
sive to those who dislike high seasoning. 

Mark well that in all cases the cup is the five-cent tin measur- 
ing cup of one exact half-pint; the teaspoon the standard one that 
will pick up 60 drops of water, of which the tablespoon is four 
times and the saltspoon one-quarter the capacity. Unless other- 
wise specified these measures are to be used level full. Particu- 
lar care should be taken with baking powder and soda — whose 
excessive use is the bane of American cookery. When the eggs 
and flour are thoroughly aerated by skilful beating and proper 
mixing, very little aid is required to make the batter light. 

To avoid redundancy, recipes for all the dishes called for are 
not published under each menu, nor for cereals that have direc- 
tions on the package; but a complete classified index is appended, 
a glance at which will show that this is a very complete cook 
book, peculiarly rich in many departments. Over 150 different 
soups are given, and a large choice in most preparations. But 
enough of this— let the editor end and the cooks begin.

spoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a little cold milk; add this 
to the water, with a teaspoonful of butter and a half-teaspoon- 
ful salt; boil up well and serve. 



6 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Apple Johnnycake — Mix a pint cornmeal with a scant half- 
cupful sugar, a pinch of salt and a teaspoonful cream tartar. 
Dissolve a half-teaspoonful soda in a little milk and stir into the 
meal, adding milk to make a batter as for pancakes — a cup and 
a half will be about the quantity. Add three very thinly sliced 
sour apples and bake in a moderate oven thirty-five minutes. 

Apricot and Fig Sauce — Cook until soft a pint of dried apri- 
cots; scald and chop half a dozen layer figs and add them to 
the apricots. Let them cook together fifteen minutes, adding a 
cup of whit© sugar. The combination is very pleasant. 

Clear Soup — Heat a heaping tablespoonful of butter in a cov- 
ered saucepan; slice into it a medium-sized onion; stir until the 
onion is browned; add two pounds of finely chopped lean raw 
beef, one quart cold water; cover closely and let it simmer three 
hours. Strain the soup, return to the kettle; add the white and 
shell of an egg, well beaten, with a little cold water; add also 
four peppercorns, a teaspoonful of salt, two cloves and a blade 
of mace. Boil five minutes, then strain and serve from a hot 
tureen. 

Stuffed Whitefish, Creamed Oyster Sauce — Selects firm, hand- 
some fish, four or five pounds in weight. Scale, wash and wipe; 
with a sharp knife make the incision for cleaning and dressing. 
See that the inside of the fish is perfectly clean. Make a rather 
rich dressing of a pint of bread crumbs; a half-teacup of boiled 
salt pork chopped fine, a hard-boiled egg mashed and chopped, a 
quarter-teaspoonful salt, a quarter-teaspoonful each of pepper and 
made mustard, a half-teacupful white-wine vinegar, a little pow- 
dered sage and a tablespoonful of butter. Fill the fish with this, 
tie up firmly in a fioured cloth and steam eight minutes to the 
pound. When ready, remove the cloth, lay the fish on a border 
of parsley and lay alternate slices of lemon and hard-boiled egg 
around the dish. Make a cream oyster sauce for it by scalding 
a cup and a half of rich milk, thicken with a tablespoonful of 
flour and one of butter rubbed smooth; add a half -teacup of 
cream with the thickening, a half-teaspoon of salt and a very 
little pepper. Scald fifteen oysters in their own liquor with a 
dash of lemon juice. Mix them with the cream sauce, pour a 
little over the fish and put the rest into a gravy bowl. 

Venison — As the main dish for a holiday dinner an eight- 
pound haunch roast will be very fine; six pounds, however, will 
be suflicient; the saddle is the next choice. If young the hoofs 
are not much opened, the fat is thick and clear. If the smell is 
sweet it is fresh, and will be improved by being laid in a crock; 
and for six pounds a pint of vinegar scalded with twelve pepper- 
corns, two cloves, a blade of mace, a bay leaf, a stalk of thyme 
and two of parsley, poured over the venison. Let it lie in this 
for two days (if the weather is cold), turning occasionally. When 
ready to roast, wash and wipe, remove the thin skin, lay a few 
strips of bacon over it or butter it well; lay a coarse paste of 
flour and water half an inch thick over it; put in the dripping 
pan with just enough cold water to cover the bottom of the pan, 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 7 

sprinkle a little salt and pepper in the water and bake one hour. 
Then remove the paste carefully; either put on a few fresh strips 
of bacon or two tablespoonfuls of butter and a teaspoonful of 
salt, and bake one-half hour, basting frequently. The last hour 
have a teaspoonful of lemon juice, a little cayenne pepper, added 
to the basting. The meat is dry, so that more butter is required 
on that account. Test it with a skewer to see if it is done. Have 
dish and plates very hot. Make a simple gravy in the roasting 
pan and pour some over the venison. Have in separate sauce- 
boats the following sauces: 

Currant Jelly Sauce — Turn into a granite pan one glass cur- 
rant jelly. Add to it two tablespoonfuls boiling water, one tea- 
spoonful dry mustard, a pinch cayenne pepper, one teaspoonful 
lemon juice, one tablespoonful cornstarch rubbed smooth in a 
little water. Boil up once and serve. 

Piquante Sauce — Melt two tablespoonfuls butter, add a small 
onion chopped very fine and fry it; then rub in one tablespoonful 
flour, add a cupful of gravy from the roasting pan, a pickled cu- 
cumber chopped fine, a half-teaspoonful each of salt, pepper and 
made mustard, a little chopped parsley. Boil ten minutes, add a 
tablespoonful vinegar, give one more boil and serve. 

Walnut and Watercress Salad — Crack thirty English walnuts, 
being careful not to break the kernels. Lay them on a flat dish 
on a layer of thinly sliced sour oranges; squeeze lemon juice 
over them and let them stand twenty-four hours. When the 
salad is needed wash and pick over a pint of cress or chop a bunch 
of celery and add to the walnuts. Pour French dressing over 
and serve. 

Cheese Fingers — When pies are made take a piece of pastry 
dough, roll out very thin and cut into strips as long and wide as 
a finger; spread on each strip grated cheese sprinkled with salt 
and pepper. Lay on another strip, pinch together, brush with 
yolk of egg, bake in a slow oven. If no pie crust is at hand a 
half-cupful flour, a tablespoonful butter and a little ice water will 
make a great plenty. 

Timbales with Preserved Strawberries — For ten timbales 
beat the yolks of six eggs to a cream and add gradually five table- 
spoonfuls of sugar. Mix five tablespoons flour with six of milk, 
beating out lumps; grate in the yellow part of the lemon rind 
and add the juice of the lemon and the sweetened yolks. Beat 
the six whites very stiff and add them to the mixture. Butter 
ten cups and nearly fill them with the batter. Sprinkle lightly 
with sugar; set them in a pan of hot water; let it nearly reach 
the tops of the cups; cover with a sheet of thick paper; bake for 
•half an hour in a hot oven; turn each out on a plate, add a 
spoonful of preserves and pour over them a hot sauce made of 
one-half teaspoonful of flour, mixed dry, in a cup of sugar; add 
one-half cup of butter, a pint of boiling water. Boil ten min- 
utes; add the grated rind of a lemon. Serve. 

Ice Pudding — Scald one pint of milk in a double boiler; 
sweeten with half a cup of sugar and pour slowly into three 



8 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

beaten eggs. Return to the double boiler and stir until it thick- 
ens, about three minutes; do not let it stay too long or it will 
curdle. When cool add one pint of cream, a half-cup sugar, a 
quarter box gelatine dissolved and strained, a half -teaspoon vanil- 
la, twenty drops bitter almond. Pour into the freezer and when 
half frozen open and put in a teacup blanched and chopped al- 
monds, a teacup candied ginger, chopped fine, a teacup chopped 
citron and half a teacup candied cherries. Stir in and finish 
freezing. Any preserved or candied fruits can be used, as one's 
taste prefers. 

Glace Chestnuts — Boil one cup sugar and one-third cup water 
until the fine threads "fly" from a silver fork dipped into it. Do 
not stir. Have ready twenty peeled boiled chestnuts cut in half. 
Dip each half lightly into the boiling sirup and lay them on a 
flat dish. They will be glazed as by ice. 

Pralines — Two cups brown sugar, a half-cup vinegar and 
water mixed. Boil, and when it "hairs" from the fork stir in all 
the pecan or hickory nut meats the sirup will hold. The moment 
it sugars stop stirring, remove from the fire and shake about to 
separate the nut meats. 

Cream Dates — Boil one cup and a half of sugar and three- 
fourths cup sweet milk; add a half-teaspoon butter. Boil until 
very thick, which will be in about ten minutes. Let it cool; when 
lukewarm beat it, adding a teaspoon lemon juice. When it be- 
comes a soft, creamy substance remove seeds from dates, fill with 
this cream and serve with chestnuts and pralines.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 9 

Hamburg Steak — Get a thick sirloin steak weighing three 
pounds. Cut off the tough end; chop it fine in a chopping bowl; 
add one-quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, one teaspoonful of onion juice. Mix all well together. Moist- 
en the hands in cold water (this prevents the meat sticking to 
them). Take two tablespoonfuls of the meat at a time and form 
it into round cakes or steaks. Fry them in butter till nicely- 
browned on both sides. Serve on a hot platter, v>^ith melted butter 
poured over. This amount makes five steaks, which is an ample 
allowance for breakfast. The sirloin and tenderloin of this steak 
will give a broiled steak for dinner next day. 

Owendaw Bread — Put one cupful of fine hominy in the double 
boiler and boil for thirty minutes. Beat two eggs light, add them 
to the hominy while it is hot, also one tablespoonful of butter, a 
half -pint of milk, a half-teaspoonful of salt, and lastly two tabje- 
spoons of cornmeal. Mix all well together. Bake for half an 
hour in a clay dish with a good deal of heat at the bottom of the 
oven and not so much at the top, so as to allow it to rise. It 
must be served in the dish in which it has been baked, and 
helped with a spoon. (This is a Southern dish.) 

Chinese Eggs with Tomato Sauce — Boil six eggs for fifteen 
minutes; throw them into cold water and remove the shells. 
Take the whites carefully from the yolks, keeping the yolks in 
shape. Cut the whites into shreds (this is best done with a scis- 
sors). Have ready six round pieces of toast on a hot platter, ar- 
range the shredded whites on the toast in the form of six nests, 
in the center of the nests place the yolks, one in each nest with 
a circle of finely chopped parsley around each yolk. Sprinkle 
lightly with pepper and salt. Pour the tomato sauce around the 
outside of the nests, and serve. This is a pretty dish, having 
such a contrast of colors — red, white, green and yellow. 

Graham Bread — On baking day take out two cupfuls of the 
sponge which has been set with the wheat fiour (after the first 
rising). Put it in a bowl, add three tablespoons of molasses, 
one pint of graham flour, half pint of wheat flour; knead for 
fifteen minutes, set it to raise again for two hours, then form it 
into a loaf and let it stand for one hour. Bake in a slow oven 
for three-quarters of an hour. Graham bread must not be put 
in a hot oven — it burns so easily. 

Apple Fritters — Pare and core four apples; slice them cross- 
wise in round slices. Beat one egg light, add one cup of milk, 
one cup of fiour in which has been sifted one teaspoonful of 
baking powder and a pinch of salt. Beat hard for three min- 
utes. Put the sliced apples into this batter. Have ready a kettle 
with hot lard. Drop the batter into it in large spoonfuls, having 
one slice of apple in each fritter; fry for ten minutes. Serve on 
a hot vegetable dish. 

White Cake — Beat a quarter of a pound of butter to a cream; 
add gradually one and a half cups of granulated sugar; add 
one cup of lukewarm water. Sift in two cups of fiour. Beat 
continuously for five minutes; then sift in another half -cup of 



10 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

flour in which has been sifted two teaspoons of baking powder. 
Beat the whites of four eggs very stiff, stir them in gently, add 
one teaspoonful of vanilla. Mix carefully for ten minutes. Turn 
it into a well-greased deep tin and bake in a moderate oven for 
one hour. This quantity gives cake for a week, having it once 
a day. 

Chocolate Blanc Mange — Put one pint of milk in the double 
boiler; add a half cup of granulated sugar, grate three table- 
spoonfuls of chocolate, mix it with one tablespoon of corn starch 
and wet with a little cold water, stir it into the boiling milk and 
boil for five minutes. Allow it to become ice cold. When ready 
to serve, pass a knife around the sides to loosen it; stand the 
mold in a pan of warm water for a few seconds (this loosens it at 
the bottom). Turn it out on a glass dish. Pour sweetened cream 
flavored with one teaspoonful of vanilla around it and serve. 

Onion Soup — Put one tablespoonful of butter in the frying 
pan. When hot add one finely chopped onion; fry it until nicely 
browned, being careful not to burn. Put one quart of soup stock 
(made from odds and ends of cold meat) into a stew pan; add 
the fried onion and cook for fifteen minutes. Strain; return to 
the fire, add one tablespoonful of flour wet in a little cold water 
to thicken, and boil for five minutes longer. Season with one- 
half a teaspoonful of salt and one-quarter teaspoonful of pepper. 
Cut two slices of stale bread into dice; brown the dice in the 
oven, put them in the soup tureen, pour the soup over them and 
serve at once before they become soft. 

Mock Duck — Take four pork tenderloins of equal length and 
weighing three-quarters of a pound each. Split them lengthwise, 
and get them as flat as possible; lay two of them on a meat 
board, one over the other, and sew them together along one side 
(for dressing). Put one pint of bread crumbs in a bowl; add 
one-quarter teaspoonful each of sage, summer savory, thyme and 
pepper; also a half-teaspoonful of salt and onion juice, two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter. Mix all well together. Now lift the 
upper one of the tenderloins which have been sewn together, put 
the half of the dressing in between them (leaving the other half 
for the other duck), and sew them up at both ends and the other 
side. Treat the other two tenderloins in the same way, thus 
making two ducks of the four tenderloins. Place the ducks in a 
dripping pan, put four slices of salt pork across each one, sprinkle 
with pepper and salt, dredge with flour, put a half cup of boiling 
water in the pan. Bake for an hour and a half, basting frequent- 
ly. When done, set them on a hot platter and stand them in the 
oven; place the pan on top of the stove; add two tablespoonfuls 
of brown flour to the dripping that has remained in it; stir till 
the flour and dripping have formed a smooth paste; add one 
pint of boiling water, pouring in gradually, stirring all the time. 
Season with one-half a teaspoonful of salt, and one-fourth tea- 
spoonful of pepper. Strain into a gravy dish; serve both the 
ducks and gravy at once. 

Cup Custards— Beat four eggs light; add a half cup of granu- 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 11 

lated sugar, one quart of milk, one-eighth of a nutmeg grated. 
Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Put the custard into five custard 
cups; stand them in a pan of boiling water; then put the pan 
in the oven. Bake till the custards are set — that is, firm in the 
center; no longer, or they will become watery. When done 
stand away to get cold. Serve them in the cups.

Oatmeal — Soak one cup of diamond-cut oatmeal in four cups 
of water over night, adding one teaspoonful of salt. Cook one 
and one-half hours in morning. 

Sweetbreads a I'lndien — Slice one large onion fine. Put in 
saucepan with tablespoon of butter. Cook until onion turns pale 
yellow. Add cup of milk, teaspoon curry powder, tablespoon pul- 
verized cocoanut, or cup of cocoanut milk if procurable. Boil 
slowly one-half hour, being careful not to burn. To this smooth 
paste add two sweetbreads, washed, drained, sliced and fried light 
brown in butter. Simmer together one-half hour, adding one cup 
of milk. When about cooked add four thin slices of green ginger, 
one-half teaspoonful of salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper, half tea- 
spoonful of lemon or lime juice, two ribbons of green peppers. 

Swedish Bread — Roll one pint of light dough half inch thick. 
Spread with butter, sugar, a dash of nutmeg and one cup of well- 
cleaned currants. Roll up, spreading butter over top. Let rise 
and bake. Slice from the end. 

Turbot a la Creme — One pint of cold seasoned fish chopped 
very fine. Take one large spoonful of butter, melt in saucepan 
and stir into it two spoonfuls of flour until smooth. Add one pint

12 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

half teaspoonful of onion juice, one-half teaspoonful salt, one tea- 
spoonful chopped parsley, a dash of cayenne pepper, one-half-tea- 
spoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Stir into fish, and put in shells 
or small china dish, covering the top with bread crumbs stirred 
into melted butter. Brown in oven ten minutes. 

Beefsteak with Fried Bananas — Broil steak, if thick, twenty 
minutes over bright fire; have ready to pour over meat one 
tablespoonful of melted butter, one-half teaspoonful of salt and a 
dash of cayenne pepper. Avoid too hot a dish, as it toughens 
steak. Cut peeled bananas in three lengthwise slices and fry in 
hot pan in butter for five minutes. Use four bananas. Cover 
over beefsteak as garnish. 

Potato Cones — Boil six large potatoes. Mash and mix with 
a seasoning of salt, pepper and onion juice. Beat into potatoes 
one tablespoonful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of milk. Shape 
carefully into small cones and brown ten minutes in oven.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 13 

every drop of juice. Lay the double slices in a circle on a pretty 
plate; pour juice over, also a small glass of sherry (if you use 
it) and the juice of one lemon. Sprinkle with pulverized sugar. 
Serve. 

Fish Steaks with Tomato Sauce — In a deep skillet put one 
tahlespoonful of lard, one tablespoonful of sifted flour and one 
onion minced. Brown this; then add the juice from a can of 
tomatoes; let this cook seven minutes. Fry brown seven or 
eight slices of fish. When done place in the skillet with the to- 
matoes, then add one-half pint of boiling water; stir, but very 
carefully, so as not to break the fish. Add a pod of garlic (if 
liked), three cloves, a bay leaf, one teaspoonful of salt and 
one-half saltspoonful of pepper, and allow the mixture to stew 
gently on back of stove while you prepare six slices of toast, 
butter it and place it on a platter. Now add two tablespoons of 
Worcestershire sauce to the saucepan, also one tablespoonful of 
butter. When the gravy is thick place piece of fish on each slice 
of toast, pour gravy over and serve. 

Corn Muffins — Beat two eggs very light, add one tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter, one tablespoonful of cornmeal, one tea- 
spoonful of brown sugar, one heaping tablespoonful of fiour, to 
which add one-half teaspoonful of baking powder and a cupful 
of milk. Mix thoroughly, pour into greased muffin rings and bake 
in a quick oven. 

Fish Souffle — Take fish left from breakfast, about a cupful, 
bone it thoroughly; put it with an equal quantity of mashed 
potatoes, add a half-cup of milk gradually; then season with a 
small saltspoonful of salt and one-third saltspoonful of pepper; 
stir in one beaten egg. Put in a buttered dish and set in oven 
until it becomes very hot; then beat the white of another egg 
very stiff and stir into the yolk, beaten with a pinch each of salt 
and pepper. Heap over the fish and brown in the oven. Serve. 

Macaroni with Apricots — Stew twenty halves of apricots in 
one-half cup of granulated sugar and enough warm water to 
make a nice sirup when done. Before taking from the fire add 
a heaping tablespoonful of brown flour and cook until the sirup 
is heavy or smooth. Parboil ten sticks of macaroni, broken 
into two-inch pieces; drain; add to one pint of boiling milk two 
ounces of sugar; throw in the parboiled macaroni and allow it 
to simmer until the milk is all absorbed; stir it often; pour all 
the juice or sauce from the stewed apricots on to the macaroni; 
cover the macaroni well; set on back of stove for fifteen min- 
utes, then take off and allow to cool; when cold, form a pile of 
macaroni in the center of dish and cover with the apricots, lay- 
ing them in layers around and over it. 

Timbales of Turkey (or Chicken) — Take one-half pound of 
the remains from the bones, selecting only those pieces that are 
still good. Chop and pound to a paste, add gradually one gill of 
cream; now add, one at a time, the whites of three eggs, unbeat- 
en, being careful to work each one well into the mixture before 
adding the next. Add one saltspoon of salt, a "speck" of cayenne 



14 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

pepper and a tablespoonful of finely chopped truffles. A little 
onion juice, Chutney sauce or Worcestershire sauce may be used 
instead of the truffles. Next stir in carefully the stiffly beaten 
whites of two eggs. Have ready small timbale cups well but- 
tered. Fill these half full of the mixture, stand in a pan of hot 
water, bake twenty minutes in moderate oven. Serve hot, with 
mushroom sauce poured over. 

Mushroom Sauce — Melt one tablespoon of butter without 
browning and one tablespoon of flour; stir until smooth. Add 
one cup of cream; stir until it begins to thicken. Add one-half 
cup of either freshly boiled or canned mushrooms, a saltspoon 
of salt, not quite half so much pepper. Serve. 

Cream of Barley Soup — Boil one knuckle of veal or chicken 
or turkey bones in two quarts of cold water very gently for three 
hours. Skim and strain. Wash a half a cup of pearl barley in 
cold water. Cover it with the white broth you have just made. 
Cover the saucepan and cook very gently until the barley is 
tender. Then remove one-third of the barley, set aside, and 
rub the remaining portion through a sieve. Now place in the 
saucepan the whole barley grains, also the barley and stock you 
passed through the sieve, add a half-pint of boiling cream, season 
to taste with salt and pepper. Throw into the soup fifteen beef 
balls, boil up once and serve three balls to each person. 

Beef Balls — Mince to a pulp any scraps of cold beef, season 
highly with onion juice, salt and pepper. Moisten with any 
cold gravy or soup left from dinner day before; set over the 
fire, stir into it one tablespoonful of flour; cook five minutes. 
Remove, and as soon as it is cool enough to handle, form into 
balls the size of marbles, dip in unbeaten egg, and fry brown 
in hot fat. Put away to use as required in soups. 

Chocolate Pie — Line a pie plate with a rich crust; bake. 
Make a filling of one-half cupful of sugar; one cupful of milk, 
butter the size of a hickorynut. When hot add one and one-half 
tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate; beat the yolks of two eggs; 
stir into the mixture; dissolve in cold milk one and one-half 
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, stirring over the fire until thick 
and smooth; add one-half teaspoonful of vanilla. Fill the shell 
with this mixture. Whip a gill of sweet cream to a froth, place 
on top of chocolate mixture and serve. Very good, indeed.

spoonful of butter, two eggs, a speck of cayenne. Beat the ham, 
cayenne, butter and eggs into the potatoes. Let it cool slightly 
and shape like croquettes. Roll in bread crumbs, dip in beaten 
egg and again in crumbs, put in the frying basket and plunge 
into boiling fat. Cook two minutes. Drain and serve. 

Little Pigs in Blankets — Season large oysters with salt and 
pepper. Cut fat English bacon in very thin slices, wrap an 
oyster in each slice and fasten with a little wooden toothpick. 
Heat a frying pan and put in the little pigs. Cook just long 
enough to crisp the bacon, about two minutes. Place on slices 
of toast that have been cut into small pieces. Do not remove the 
skewers; garnish with parsley. Have the pan very hot before 
the pigs are put in and shake continually; do not burn.

ham, two eggs, one teaspoonful of mixed mustard, a speck of 
cayenne and three tablespoonfuls of stock or water. Spread 
upon the beef, which roll up firmly and tie with soft twine, be- 
ing careful not to draw too tight, as it would cut the meat as 
soon as it began to cook. Cover the roll with flour and fry brown 
in four tablespoonfuls of ham or pork fat. Put it in as small 
saucepan as will hold it. Into the fat remaining in the pan put 
two finely chopped onions and cook until a pale yellow, then add 
two tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir three minutes longer. Pour 
upon this one pint and a half of boiling water. Boil up once and 
pour over the roulette; then add two cloves, one-fourth of a tea- 
spoonful of pepper and one heaping teaspoonful of salt. Cover 
the saucepan and set where it will simmer slowly for three hours; 
after the first hour and a half turn the roulette over. Serve hot, 
with the gravy strained over it. Garnish with parsley.

in small cups previously buttered and turn out. Serve with or

Economical Veal Soup — Boil two pounds of veal from the 
neck that will make a pie or fricassee. When tender take out 
meat and save for that purpose. Leave in the bones and boil 
gently for about two hours more, then strain the liquor and let

crumbs, fry a light brown color in beef drippings. Serve with

is left of fowl for luncheon next day. 

Celery in Sauce — Cut three full heads of celery into finger 
lengths; tie them into little bundles, blanch them in boiling

soup. When they are cooked prepare a brown butter sauce, dilute 
it with the broth the celery was boiled in and let it seethe. To

all with sauce. (This makes a very delicious dinner dish as well 
as a very cheap one.)

20 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

wire broilers over clear, red coals, place upon hot platter and 
squeeze a few drops of lemon juice over. 

Gingerbread — One-half cup of molasses, one-half cup of 
sugar, one-third cup of milk, one-third cup of butter, one egg, 
one teaspoon of soda in the molasses, one teaspoon each of gin- 
ger, salt and cinnamon, two cups of flour. Bake in flat pan and 
cut with heated knife. Very good on a cold day with a glass of 
hot milk into which a trifle of salt has been put. 

Boston Baked Beans — This is the true Hub recipe and forms 
a nice meal without vegetables: Allow three pints of beans to 
soak in cold water over night. Parboil them in fresh water the 
next morning. When they begin to soften a little drain the water 
off and put in the bean-pot, with a half-pound of salt pork at the 
bottom and on top of the beans place another piece of pork, a 
half-pound in weight. Pork should be streaked with fat and lean, 
the rind side, which has been scored in squares, uppermost. This 
is better than the old way of placing all the pork on top. Mix 
one large tablespoonful of dry mustard in a half-cupful of mo- 
lasses and pour over the contents of the pot and fill with boiling 
water to cover the pork and put on the lid. Now put in gentle 
oven and bake slowly for eight or ten hours, add boiling water 
as that over the beans cooks away. They will be soft, yet whole, 
and of a rich, brown color all the way through. This is suflacient 
for several meals. 

Apple Roll — Pare, core and cut into even pieces enough 
apples to fill a quart. Make a short biscuit dough by rubbing 
two small tablespoonfuls of lard or butter or both into three 
small cupfuls of flour, with which has been previously sifted one 
and one-half teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a large pinch 
of salt. Rub fine and mix to a very soft dough with cold milk or 
water, turn out on molding-board and lightly press out in a 
shape longer than wide, put the apples on this and begin at one 
end and roll up. Put loosely in a pudding cloth which has been 
wrung out of very hot water and sifted with flour, and steam 
one and one-half hours or a little longer. A slight sifting of 
either nutmeg or cloves may be put with apples before rolling, 
but no sweetening. 

Hard Sauce— Slightly soften half cupful of butter by adding 
a tablespoonful of hot water. Stir until very creamy and then 
stir in one and one-half cupfuls of light-brown sugar. Stir un- 
til very light. Flavor with nutmeg and vanilla essence or 
brandy. M. M. Manney.

season with one-half teaspoon of salt and a dash of pepper. 

Boston Cream Pie — (Cream Part) — Put a pint of milk on to 
boil. Beat two eggs, add one-half cup of sugar and one small 
half cup of flour, previously mixed; beat well and stir into milk 
just as it commences to boil; add one ounce of butter, a pinch 
of salt, and keep stirring until it thickens. Flavor with half tea- 
spoon of lemon or vanilla. 

(Crust Part) — Three eggs, beaten separately, cup of granu- 
lated sugar, a pinch of salt, one and a half cups of sifted flour, 
large teaspoonful of baking powder, and two tablespoons of milk, 
or water. Divide the batter in half and bake on pie-tins until a

three hours. Good hot or cold. Enough for several meals. 

Mother's Cake — Cream one small cup of butter, add gradu- 
ally a cup and a half of sugar, then the beaten yolks of three eggs, 
and a small teaspoonful of vanilla extract and a saltspoon of 
mace. Take a teacup and sift it even full three times of pastry 
(winter wheat) flour, add one and a half teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder. Stir flour into the mixture alternating with one-half a 
cupful of milk; lastly the whites of the eggs beaten stiff. Bake 
forty or fifty minutes in a moderate oven. Use two square, shal- 
low pans unless a loaf cake is desired, in v/hich case the cupfuls 
of flour should be a little larger. Spread one layer with jelly, 
thinly, and over that half a cupful of chopped raisins, quarter 
cupful of chopped almonds, same of cocoanut and beaten white 
of one egg. Put top layer in place and cover with icing. 

Tapioca Cream Soup — Soak one-third of a cupful of tapioca 
over night in two cupfuls of cold water after washing the tapioca 
well. Add one quart of white stock (water in which chicken, 
veal or mutton has been boiled) and cook together very slowly 
for one hour. Cut up one onion and two stalks of celery and cook 
for twenty minutes in a pint of rich milk with a blade of mace; 
strain on the tapioca, season with half a teaspoonful of salt, a 
pinch of pepper, one tablespoonful of butter and serve. 

White Fish, au gratin — Skin the fish by starting at the head 
and draw down towards the tail, remove the bones, cut in pieces 
about three inches square and salt and pepper well. Butter a 
dish and put in a layer of the fish, add sauce, then another layer 
of fish and sauce, and cover then with fine bread crumbs. Bake 
half an hour. For the sauce brown two tablespoonfuls of fiour 
and three of butter and add gradually a pint of stock or milk, 
cold; when it boils add salt and pepper to taste, the juice of half 
a lemon, a tablespoonful of onion juice, a tablespoonful of vine- 
gar and a few leaves of chopped parsley. A three pound fish is 
enough for six persons. 

Parsnips Fried in Molasses — Boil parsnips in salted water un- 
til done. Let cool; slice, and fry brown in a cupful of boiling 
molasses. Good.

Baked Apples — Take as many tart apples as are needed, wash 
and remove cores, leaving quite a hollow in each apple, in which 
place a teaspoonful of sugar, a dash of cinnamon and as ma,ny 
stewed prunes as apples will hold. Bake slowly until apples are 
tender; serve cold with cream. 

Boiled Rice — After washing the rice put it over the fire in 
plenty of actually boiling, salted water and let it boil fast for 
twelve minutes, then drain off all the water and place the sauce- 
pan containing the rice in the oven with the door open and let it 
steam ten minutes, or until it is as tender as desirable; every 
grain will be distinct and the rice free from moisture. 

Poached Eggs — Ham sauce — Mince fine three thin slices of 
boiled ham, a small onion and a little parsley; add half a cup of 
water, three shakes of pepper, and stew all together a quarter of 
an hour. Put the poached eggs on a dish, squeeze over them the 
juice of half an orange or lemon and pour over the sauce about 
half boiling and strained. 

Mock sweetbreads — Take the strings from two pounds of lean 
veal and chop it very fine with quarter pound of veal suet; soak a 
roll in milk and beat it light; mix this with the veal and suet and 
grated rind of one lemon, pepper, salt, a very little nutmeg and 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 29 

two eggs. Shape like sweetbreads, dip in egg and breadcrumbs, 
fry or bake a golden brown, and serve with thick veal gravy. 

Omelet — Beat six eggs very light, add five macaroons pounded 
fine, beat them well together; fry as usual; add a half teaspoonful 
of salt before folding; sprinkle well with powdered sugar and 
serve. 

Calf's Head Soup — Take a calf's head, well cleaned, and a 
knuckle of veal, put them into a large kettle; tie one onion and a 
large tablespoonful of mixed sweet herbs in a cloth and place in 
the kettle with the meat, over which pour four quarts of water; 
let it boil slowly and steadily for five hours, season well with 
salt and pepper. One hour before serving pour the soup through 
a colander, pick out all the meat carefully, chop very fine and 
return it to the soup, putting it again over the fire. Boil four 
eggs very hard, chop them fine, and slice one lemon very thin; 
add to soup just before serving. This will make soup for several 
days. 

Rabbit Stew — Wash well the rabbit, cut it into quarters, lard 
them with slices of bacon and fry them; then put them into a 
stew-pan with a little more than a pint of good broth or stock, 
some savory herbs, salt and pepper to taste; simmer gently until 
the rabbit is tender; then strain the gravy, thicken it with fiour 
and butter, give one boil, pour over the rabbit and serve; garnish 
with slices of lemon. 

Dried Peach Pudding — Boil one pint of milk; while hot pour 
it over one pint of bread crumbs; stir into this one teaspoonful 
of cold butter and one pint of dried peaches stewed soft. When 
all is cool add two eggs well beaten, half-cupful sugar, and fiavor- 
ing to taste. Put in a well-greased pudding dish and bake half an 
hour; serve warm with hard sauce. Mrs. Marion Wilson.

30 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Grilled Beef on Toast — Melt a large spoonful of butter in a 
skillet, and when it is hot lay in slices of cold beef and let them 
heat through. If the beef "left-overs" are not in slices, but 
scraps, then chop coarsely and heat. Make a sauce of two table- 
spoonfuls hot water, two of butter, one tablespoonful each of 
Worcestershire sauce and tomato catsup, one dessertspoonful 
made mustard, one-fourth teaspoonful salt, one-half teaspoon pep- 
per, one teaspoon lemon juice, or vinegar. If onion is liked, chop 
finely one-half a medium sized onion, brown in a tablespoon 
butter, and add. Thicken with a teaspoonful flour rubbed smooth 
with a teaspoonful butter. Lay delicately browned slices of hot 
buttered toast on a hot platter, lay the grilled beef on the toast, 
pour the sauce over; serve very hot. 

Raised Hominy Waffles — The small hominy is best for these. 
To a coffee cup of boiled hominy add one pint boiled milk and one 
tablespoonful of butter, one pint of flour, one-half teaspoonful salt, 
one tablespoonful sugar and a scant half-teacup yeast. Beat well, 
cover, set in a warm place over night. In the morning add two 
well-beaten eggs, yolks and whites separately. Bake in waffle 
irons. This recipe answers as well for muffins if it is not con- 
venient to make waffles. 

Lemon Apple Sauce — Pare and quarter six good-sized apples. 
Put a large cup of sugar and a half-cup of water on to boil, and 
when it is a sirup drop in the apple quarters, with two or three 
slices of fresh lemon. Cook until tender, but do not break the 
quarters. 

Kedgeree — Shred into small flakes any nice cold fish until 
there is a heaping cupful — there should be rather more than a 
half a pint. Add to this a teacup of boiled rice, into which has 
been stirred two tablespoonfuls melted butter, a half-teaspoonful 
salt, a quarter-teaspoon pepper, a pinch each of cayenne and 
mace. Add to this a cup of hot milk which has been thickened 
with a teaspoonful each of flour and butter rubbed together. Stir 
this until very hot; then add two well-beaten eggs; do not let it 
remain a second longer, but pour into a hot dish and serve at 
once. The eggs may be omitted in a time of scarcity, and it is 
excellent without them. This may be prepared in a chafing dish. 

Luncheon Potatoes — Into a tablespoonful of butter made hot 
stir one-fourth of an onion and brown it. Add two cups cold 
potato chopped or thinly sliced and let them brown. Just before 
taking them up sprinkle them with a quarter-teaspoonful each of 
salt and dry mustard. 

Apricot Fritters — Make a batter of one cup of flour, one table- 
spoonful of butter, a half-teaspoonful of baking powder, a pinch 
of salt and a well-beaten egg. Thin the batter with juice from the 
can of appricots — about half a teacup. Have boiling lard ready; 
cut the apricots in halves, dip each half in the batter and fry. 
Dust the fritters, while they drain, with powdered sugar. Half 
a can of apricots will be enough for luncheon, the other half can 
be used next day. 

Cream Barley Soup — Take the bones from the shoulder of 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 31 

mutton, have them cracked, add a 5-cent beef soup bone, and boil 
in three quarts of water, with four tablespoonfuls of pearl barley, 
a slice of onion, a teaspoonful of salt, three or four pepper corns, 
a clove or two, a blade of mace, a stalk of celery, if convenient. 
Simmer six hours; strain and skim. Half an hour before dinner 
heat to boiling a quart of rich milk, thickened with a tablespoon- 
ful each of butter and flour. Add to the strained soup, boil up 
once and serve, adding a half-teaspoonful of salt just before 
pouring it into the tureen. Serve with tiny squares of toasted 
bread. This is sufficient for at least two days. 

Stuffed Shoulder of Mutton — Split the shoulder in the middle 
— on the inside — and remove both bones (the bones make good 
Scotch broth if barley soup is not desired). Lay the shoulder 
open on the table and spread it with a dressing made of a cup 
of bread crumbs, a cup of mashed potato, a tablespoon each of 
vinegar, catsup and melted butter, a half-teaspoon each of salt and 
pepper, a clove, a bay leaf, a blade of mace, a tablespoonful of 
cooking wine, a tablespoonful rich milk. Roll the shoulder up, 
tie with twine, roast, allowing eighteen or twenty minutes to the 
pound. Baste frequently. 

Baked Salsify — Scrape the roots and lay them in cold water 
containing a little vinegar. This will keep the roots from dark- 
ening. Boil until tender, then cut into dice. Butter a baking 
pan, put in a layer of bread crumbs, a layer of cream sauce, a 
layer of salsify and so on till the dish is nearly filled. Pour 
cream sauce over the last layer. The cream sauce is made of a 
tablespoon each of butter and flour rubbed together, to a scant 
pint rich milk, a teaspoon salt and a half-teaspoon pepper. Dust 
each layer of crumbs lightly with salt and pepper and put a half- 
teaspoon butter in tiny dots to every layer of crumbs. 

Prune Cream Pie — Stew, stone and mash through the colander 
enough prunes to make a cup of pulp. To this add one cup thin 
cream, thickened by a teaspoon of cornstarch rubbed smooth in 
a little cold milk, the yolks of two well-beaten eggs and one- 
third cup sugar. Put in a spoonful or two of the apricot juice left 
from luncheon for flavor. Line a pie plate with pie crust, fill 
with the mixture and bake as quickly as you can without burning. 
Beat the whites stiff and when the pie is done stir into the beaten 
whites two tablespoonfuls powdered sugar, spread over the top of 
the pie; brown lightly. Eat cold or hot as preferred.

squash; add the butter, sugar and salt. When cool add the egg, 
well beaten, then the baking powder mixed with the flour. Fry 
a delicate brown. 

Salmon Croquettes — Drain the liquor from a small can of 
salmon, remove the bones and chop very fine. Bring a cup of 
milk to the boiling point and stir in a tablespoonful of flour 
rubbed smooth in two tablespoonfuls of butter. Add the chopped 
salmon and boil one minute. Stir in two well-beaten eggs and 
remove from the fire. When cold make into croquettes, dip in 
beaten egg, roll in bread crumbs and fry. 

Scalloped Mutton with Macaroni — Remove the fat and skin 
from cold roast mutton, cut the meat into small thin slices and 
season it with salt and pepper. Butter a shallow pudding dish, 
put in a layer of cracker crumbs, then a layer of meat, then one 
of cold boiled macaroni cut in inch pieces. Over the macaroni 
sprinkle a tablespoonful of tomato catchup. Proceed in this way

tablespoonful of anise seed. Stir eggs and sugar in one direction 
for one-half hour, then add sufficient flour and roll thin, same as 
ginger snaps. Cut into cakes, as fancy may direct, and bake. 

Chicken Smothered in Sauerkraut — For this delicious dish use 
an earthern baker (v/ith a tight cover, if possible). Procure a 
small-sized j^oung chicken; dress, draw and singe. Rub well with 
a flour and water paste; wipe quite dry inside; dust with salt and 
pepper. Rinse and drain one quart of sweet, fresh sauerkraut. 
Fill the chicken with hot mashed potatoes, well seasoned; lay it 
in the roaster, and place on it two slices of bacon (place two 
slices in bottom of roaster also) ; then cover the chicken com- 
pletely with sauerkraut; add a saltspoonful of salt and half that 
quantity of pepper. Pour over a cup of cold water, close down 
the lid tight and roast in the oven three hours; have a moderate 
fire; do not allow to cook dry; add boiling water as required to 
keep bottom of roaster quite moist; when done lift the chicken 
on to a large platter, pile the sauerkraut around it and garnish 
with slices of lemon; to the sauce in roaster add a large table- 
spoon of browned flour, a tablespoon of caramel and a cup of 
soup stock; boil up-; add one tablespoon of lemon juice, salt and

Mother's "surprise." Tea. 



Corn Cakes — One pint of meal, one of sour milk or butter- 
milk, one egg, one teaspoon of soda, one-half teaspoon of salt; a 
tablespoon of flour or corn starch may be used in place of the 
egg. Bake on a hot griddle. 

Feather Cake — One cup of sugar, one-half cup of sweet milk, 
one egg, one tablespoonful butter, one cup of flour, a little salt, 
one teaspoonful of baking powder; flavor to taste. 

Chocolate (American) — Procure the best chocolate; grate it, 
allowing two heaping tablespoonfuls to a quart of mixed milk and 
water. Boil it fifteen minutes, taking off the scum as it rises, 
and serve with sugar and cream. 

Spanish Soup — Soak one pound of white beans over night, boil 
them the next morning till tender, add one small white cabbage, 
which has been cut up fine, a bit of bacon, a whole red pepper 
and some salt; boil the whole for an hour. Heat some lard or 
drippings in a saucepan and fry in it a sliced onion; put in the 
soup little by little; stir often with a wooden spoon. A little 
olive butter and garlic makes this a perfect representative of the 
favorite soup kept for all travelers in Spanish climes. 

A Brown Stew — Four hours before needed put on stove a 
rather thick piece of beef, with little bone, and some fat, pour on 
just boiling water enough to cover, cover with a close-fitting lid, 
boil gently, and, as the water boils away, add only just enough 
from time to time to keep from burning, so that when the meat 
is tender the v/ater may all be boiled away; the fat will allow 
the meat to brown without burning; turn occasionally, brown 
evenly over a slow fire, and make a gravy by stirring flour and 
water together and adding to the drippings; season with salt an 
hour before it is done. 

Hot Slaw — Take one-half of a firm, white head of cabbage, 
cut into fine pieces and put in a pan with a teaspoonful of salt, 
about the same quantity of pepper and a piece of butter the size 
of an egg, adding a teacupful of vinegar and half that quantity of 
water. Cover and cook until the cabbage becomes tender, stirring 
frequently. 

Mother's "Surprise" — Take half a square loaf of baker's 
bread, cut into thin slices, crust and all, and butter them. Peel, 
core and cut up sufficient of nice baking apples in proportion. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 37 ' 

Take a pie dish, line it with bread and butter. Next make a 
layer of apples at the bottom, then of sugar, then of bread and so 
on till the dish is filled. Bake until the apples are perfectly soft; 
then before serving turn it out into a dish. It ought to keep its 
shape, and eat almost like a sweetmeat, all the ingredients being 
thoroughly blended in baking. Miss Idelle Jennings.

cracker crumbs and try in hot lard. 

Slip — Slip is bonny-clabber without its acidity and so delicate 
that some like it as well as ice cream. Make a quart of milk 
warm; then stir in one tablespoon of rennet; set it by, and when 
cool again will be as stiff as jelly. Serve with powdered sugar, 
nutmeg and cream.

basting frequently with a sirup made of the juice of one lemon, a 
tablespoonful of melted butter and three tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

Normandy Salad — Stew very gently in their own liquor a 
small can of French peas. When the peas have absorbed all the 
liquor remove from fire and allow to cool. Chop half a pound of 
English walnuts, mix with the peas and pour over half a cup of 
mayonnaise dressing. 

Prune Pie — Stew the prunes as for sauce, stone them and 
tear into small pieces. Line a deep pie dish with crust, fill with 
the prunes and sprinkle over half a cup of sugar and a little 
cinnamon. Cover with a meringue made of the white of one egg 
and two scant tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar.

40 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

thickened with a level tablespoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a 
little cold milk; add to this a teaspoonful butter, a half-teaspoon- 
ful salt, a Quarter-teaspoonful pepper. A tablespoonful of cream 
is a great improvement. Have ready slices of toast about three 
inches square buttered, with a drop of lemon juice or catsup on 
each slice. Lay the toast on a hot platter, put the hot fish on 
the slices of toast and pour the cream over. Any cold meat may 
be used instead of the fish. Chicken is particularly nice. 

Cornmeal Flapjacks — Scald over night two cups of Indian 
meal with a quart of boiling inilk or milk and water mixed, add- 
ing one tablespoonful butter, one tablespoonful brown sugar or 
molasses. Cover closely and let it stand until morning, when add 
yolks of two well-beaten eggs, one scant cup flour and one tea- 
spoonful salt. Heat and grease the griddle, and then add to the 
batter one teaspoonful soda dissolved in a little hot milk, and, 
last of all, whites of two eggs beaten stiff, stirred in lightly. If 
the batter is too stiff in the morning, stir in a little cold milk. 

Potato Scones — To a heaping cup of mashed potato add a 
tablespoonful of milk, half a cup of flour and' half a teaspoonful 
salt. Work the flour in well, roll out half an inch thick, cut in 
rounds, prick with a fork to prevent blistering, bake in a quick 
oven. Split and butter and eat while hot. 

Peach and Prune Sauce — Wash thoroughly a pint of prunes, 
cover with as little cold water as possible and let them steam 
until tender; add a cup of sugar, a cup of juice from canned 
peaches and six or eight slices of peach. Let the sirup boil up 
enough to mix the fruit well, but not enough to break the peaches, 

Olive Squares — Cut thin squares of brown bread, butter each 
slice and sprinkle very lightly with salt and pepper. Stone eight 
olives, chop them with two stalks of celery, one tiny cucumber 
pickle, a teaspoonful catsup, a saltspoon of salt, a pinch of pep- 
per and a very little made mustard — just about the eighth of a 
teaspoonful. Mix well, spread on the brown bread, cover with 
another slice of buttered bread, pile in a square; if slices of cold 
meat are wished, they can be laid next the bread and the chopped 
olives on the meat. 

Friar's Omelet — Stew and sift six large apples; while hot add 
one cupful sugar, one teaspoonful butter. When cool add three 
beaten eggs. Heat a large tablespoonful of butter and brown in 
it one cupful stale, fine bread crumbs. Butter a mold, sprinkle 
crumbs on bottom and sides; fill with the prepared apple, to 
which add juice of one lemon, cover with crumbs; bake a half- 
hour. When cool turn out on a platter, eat with sugar and 
cream. It can be eaten hot if preferred. 

Cream of Rice Soup — Three pints of veal or chicken or beef 
broth will be needed as a basis for this excellent soup. Wash one- 
third cupful rice and put it on with the broth to cook. Put three 
tablespoonfuls of butter into a pan, and put into it when hot 
three tablespoonfuls each of chopped carrot, celery and onion. 
Let them cook slowly twenty minutes, then remove the vegetables 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 41 

to the soup; stir two tablespoonfuls flour into the butter left 
from the vegetables, add that to the soup with a bit of mace, three 
cloves, one-half teaspoon pepper and two teaspoonfuls salt. Let 
all simmer gently two hours. Strain soup, add a quart of rich 
milk heated in a double boiler, boil up once and serve. 

Chicken Pie — An old chicken is best for this if plump; joint 
the fowl and divide the breast, put on with just enough cold 
water to cover, a small sliced onion, and boil slowly until tender. 
If salt pork is liked, add, a.s soon as the water boils, three or four 
narrow shreds a finger in length; when nearly tender add half a 
teaspoonful of salt and a quarter-teaspoonful of pepper or a small 
bit of red-pepper pod. Make a crust of three cups flour, one 
teaspoonful (heaping) baking povv^der, one saltspoon salt, one- 
half cup butter, chopped fine with the flour, and rich milk to 
make a dough just soft enough to roll out nicely. If the crust 
is desired very rich, use three-fourths cup butter. Line the baking 
dish with a thin layer of this, put in the chicken, with a table- 
spoonful butter cut into bits and enough of the broth from the 
chicken to make gravy rather more than a pint. Cover with a 
crust, having slits cut in to allow the steam to escape. Fifteen 
minutes before serving raise the crust and put in two hard- 
boiled eggs cut in thin slices, a dozen oysters and a cup each of 
chicken gravy and cream or rich milk, heated and thickened with 
a scant tablespoonful of flour, rubbed smooth with a tablespoonful 
of butter. If there is any piecrust left, roll out, cut in squares, 
bake in a quick oven and pass with gravy made of the rest of 
the broth, with milk and flour added in the same proportions 
as the gravy in the pie; a blade of mace, a clove and a bit of red 
pepper improve the taste of the gravy. 

Potato Hillocks — Whip boiled potatoes very light; to a pint 
of mashed potato adB a scant tablespoon butter, a tablespoon 
hot milk or cream, a half-teaspoon salt, a quarter-teaspoon pepper. 
Beat in a raw egg, shape into small conical heaps; put in a 
greased pan into a hot oven, and as they brown glaze them with 
butter. Have the oven very hot; also have a very hot platter. 
Slip a cake-turner under each one and transfer to the hot dish. 

Lima Beans — Wash well 'a pint of Lima beans in two waters; 
soak three hours in warm water; drain and cook in just enough 
water to cover them (boiling water). Cover closely and boil for 
an hour and a half, watching that the water does not boil away. 
When tender, drain; add to the water (there should not be more 
than a cupful) a cupful rich milk, a tablespoon each of flour and 
butter, rubbed together, a half-teaspoon each salt and pepper. 
Pour over the beans and serve. They are nice warmed over with a 
tablespoon butter cut up over them and allowed to brown. 

Spiced Apple Pickles — To three pounds pared apples allov/ 
one pound and a half sugar and a half-cup vinegar; tie up a stick 
or two of cinnamon, a blade or two of mace, a few cloves, in a 
bag, and put with vinegar and sugar and a teacup water. When 
it boils put in the apples; let them cook until they are tender. 



42 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Pour the spiced vinegar over them. Scald once or twice the first 
week by draining off and reheating the vinegar. Small apples are 
best for this pickle. 

Peach Snowdrift — Drain a can of peaches; take a teacup of 
sugar and a cup and a half of the peach juice, and boil them 
until the sirup is clear and rich. Drop the peaches in and let 
them cook a short time, not long enough to break them; lay them 
in a glass dish and pour over them the snowdrift made by boil- 
ing one pint milk and one-half cup sugar and two tablespoon- 
fuls cornstarch until thick and smooth; add the stiffly beaten 
whites of three eggs, and a teaspoonful vanilla. Serve cold with 
the following: 

Sauce — Scald one pint milk in a double boiler, beat two table- 
spoonfuls sugar with yolks of three eggs, pour milk on them, re- 
turn to the fire and add one tablespoon cornstarch rubbed smooth 
in a little milk. Stir until it thickens; when done, add a tea- 
spoonful vanilla. Or use cream or 

Fruit Sauce — One cup peach juice, one-half cup sugar, one 
teaspoonful each cornstarch and butter. Mix cornstarch with

Spaghetti, with Cream Sauce — Boil one-quarter pound spag^ 
hetti twenty minutes in salted water, then dip in cold water to

44 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

one-fourth teaspoonfiil of salt, one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper. 
Melt the butter in the water, then add the other Ingredients and 
cook till thoroughly heated through; then put into a baking pan 
and place in the oven till brown on top. 

White Muffins — One tablespoonful of soft butter, two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar; rub to a cream; two beaten eggs, a saltspoon- 
ful of salt, one cupful of sweet milk, two rounding teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder, two cupfuls of flour. Bake in buttered muffin 
rings. 

Panned Oysters — One pint of oysters, one tablespoonful of 
butter, one of cracker crumbs, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one- 
fourth teaspoonful of pepper, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, a 
speck of cayenne. Put the oysters on in their own liquor, 
which should be strained, and when they boil up add the other 
ingredients, cook one minute and serve on hot-buttered toast. 
Garnish the dish with thin slices of lemon. 

Baked Sliced Potatoes — Pare and cut five medium-sized po- 
tatoes in slices one-fourth of an inch thick, place in a buttered 
baking pan, dot over with a little butter and a slight sprinkling 
of salt and pepper; bake in a quick oven till a delicate brown, 
take up in a hot tureen and pour over them four tablespoonfuls 
of hot cream. 

Brown Bread Sandwiches — Cut brown bread in very thin 
slices, spread with butter and put a thin slice of rich cream cheese 
between the slices. 

Spiced Currants — If these have not been prepared in their 
season take one-half a can of canned currants, add one cupful of 
sugar and one-half teaspoonful each of cinnamon and cloves; 
cook until thick, then add one tablespoonful of vinegar. Any 
kind of fruit can be prepared in this way, or the "remnants" of 
two or three kinds can be put together, thereby making a pleas- 
ing change and saving the fruit. It can be put in jelly glasses 
and will keep any length of time. 

Green-Pea Soup — Put one can of peas, one small onion sliced 
and one can of water together; cook twenty minutes, then add 
one can of milk (measure the water and milk in the can the peas 
were in). When hot thicken with one tablespoonful of butter 
and tv/o of flour, cooked together, one teaspoonful of salt and 
one-fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper; boil ten minutes and 
strain. 

Veal Cutlets with Tomato Sauce — Select the nicest cuts of 
veal chops, sprinkle lightly with salt and pepper, then roll in 
cracker crumbs and fry in plenty of butter till well done. Have 
ready a sauce made of one coffeecupful of canned tomatoes, in 
which has been cooked one small onion, chopped very fine; add 
a saltspoonful of salt and half as much pepper, cook slowly a 
long time until the onion is tender and the sauce quite thick; 
then add a teaspoonful of butter and pour over the chops; serve 
hot at once. 

French Dressing for Lettuce-^hree tablespoonfuls of oil, 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 45 

one of vinegar, one saltspoonful of salt, one-half a saltspoonful 
of pepper. Put the salt and pepper in a cup and add one table- 
spoonful of the oil. Mix thoroughly, then add remainder of the 
oil and the vinegar. This is dressing enough for a salad for five 
or six persons. If you like the flavor of onion grate a little juice 
into the dressing; two or three drops will be sufficient for this 
rule. 

Sponge Pudding — Take five pieces of common sponge cake, 
split them, spread with butter, put them together again and lay 
in the bottom of a buttered pudding dish. Make a custard of three 
eggs, three cupfuls of milk and half a cupful of sugar, flavor with 
a teaspoonful of vanilla or any flavor you choose. Pour this over 
the cake and bake half an hour. The cake will swell and fill 
the custard. Mrs. W. J. Header.

one large cake, or enough for six meals in a family of five. It is 
improved by the addition of two eggs. 



46 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Celery Soup— One head of celery cut in small pieces, cooked 
slowly in three pints of milk; when done mix one heaping table- 
spoonful of flour in a half-cup of cold milk, add slowly to the 
soup, stirring well all the time to prevent burning; then add one 
tablespoon of butter, one teaspoon of salt and one of pepper. 
Serve hot. 

Roast pork is very much improved by sprinkling a little sage 

over the top. 

Sweet potatoes should be boiled until nearly done, then 
skinned and put in the pan with the pork and roasted until 
brown.

tablespoons of sugar, three pints of milk, one stick of cinnamon;

48 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

salt, pepper, and one large tablespoonful of flour. Peel the pota- 
toes and boil and mash them light and fine. Add salt, pepper, 
one tablespoonful butter and a cupful of milk, which has been 
allowed to come to a boil. Beat well and spread a thin layer of 
the potato on the center of a hot platter. Heap the remainder 
around the edge, making a wall to keep in the cream and fish 
which should then be poured in. Finish the border with parsley 
and serve. 

To Prepare the Fish — Put a pint of milk on to boil with the 
onion. Mix flour and butter together, and when well mixed, add 
two tablespoonfuls of the hot milk. Stir all into the boiling 
milk, skim out the onion, add the fish, and boil ten minutes. Sea- 
son with pepper, a little salt if necessary. This is a pretty as 
well as a good dish. 

Hominy Drop Cakes — One pint of fresh boiled hominy (cold 
may be used; if the latter, break into grains as lightly as pos- 
sible with a fork and heat in a double boiler without adding 
water), one tablespoonful water, two eggs, whites and yolks beaten 
separately. Stir the yolks into the hominy first, then the whites, 
a teaspoonful of salt, if not already salted, if it is, one-half as 
much. Drop by spoonfuls on well buttered tin sheets, or pans, 
and bake to a good brown in a quick oven. 

Sardine Salad — Arrange a layer of any kind of cooked fish 
on a bed of crisp lettuce. Split six sardines, and if there are any 
bones, remove them. Cover the fish with the sardine dressing. 
Over this put the sardines, having the ends meet in the center of 
the dish. At the base of the dish make a wreath of thin slices of 
lemon. Garnish with parsley or lettuce, and serve at once. 

Cracker Toast — Butter as many soda crackers as will be 
eaten and place them in a dripping pan. Set the pan in the 
oven until the crackers assume a golden brown color. Serve very 
hot. 

Fairy Gingerbread — One cupful of butter, two of sugar, one of 
milk, four of flour, one-third teaspoon soda, one tablespoonful 
ginger. Beat the butter to a cream; add the sugar, gradually, and 
when light, the ginger; the milk in which the soda has been dis- 
solved, and finally the flour. Turn baking pans upside down and 
wipe the bottoms very clean. Butter them and spread the cake 
very thin upon them. Bake in a moderate oven until brown. 
While still hot cut into squares with a cake knife and slip from 
the pan. Keep in a tin box. This is delicious. With this quantity 
enough for several days may be made. Remember to spread it as 
thin as a wafer and cut it the instant it is taken from the oven. 

Scotch Roll — Remove the tough skin from about five pounds 
of the flank of beef. With a sharp knife cut meat from the thick 
part and lay it upon the thin. Mix together two tablespoonfuls 
of salt, half a teaspoonful pepper, one-eighth teaspoonful of clove, 
and one teaspoonful of summer savory. Sprinkle this over the 
meat and then sprinkle with three tablespoonfuls vinegar. Roll 
up and tie with twine. Put away in a cold place for twelve hours. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 49 

When it has stood so long, place it in a stew pan, cover with boil- 
ing water and simmer gently for three hours and a half. Mix 
four heaping tablespoonfuls of flour with half a cupful of cold 
water and stir into the gravy. Season to taste with salt and 
pepper, and simmer half an hour longer. Good, either hot or 
cold. 

Cheese Custards — Six tablespoonfuls grated cheese, two of 
butter, four eggs, one cup milk with a teaspoonful cornstarch 
dissolved in it, salt and pepper to taste. Beat the eggs very light 
and pour upon them the heated milk with the cornstarch and a 
pinch of soda in it. While warm add butter, pepper, salt and 
cheese, and pour into greased custard cups. Bake in a quick oven 
about fifteen minutes, or until high and brown. Serve at once, 
with bread and butter as a separate course before dessert. 

Shells — Use twice the quantity of shells that you would of 
broken cocoa and boil twice as long. Harriet Mann.

salt and finally a cup of light snow (snow must be light and dry); 
fry the fritters in a kettle of hot fat as soon as possible, keep- 
ing the batter where it is cold between each frying. This dish

into strands the length of the breadpan, and placing the strands 
close together pinch them into one piece of dough at one end. 
Braid the strands as if they were pieces of ribbon. Press the 
braided mass until it is the size of the pan and put it in the pan. 
Let it rise, and bake like the other bread. Let it stand ten or 
fifteen minutes after it comes from the oven; then tear it apart in 
long, thin pieces. Spread these in a large dripping pan or tin 
sheet and bake in a very hot oven until brown and crisp — a quar- 
ter of an hour. Serve hot. The work shoul'd be so timed that the 
bread will be ready for the oven one hour and three-quarters 
before time for serving. The bread may be prepared any time 
and heated again when desired for the table, but is best fresh. 

Cheese Puffs — Take two tablespoonfuls of butter, four of flour, 
four of grated cheese, one cupful of water, half a teaspoonful of 
salt, one-fifth of a teaspoonful of cayenne and two eggs. Put the 
butter and water on the stove in a saucepan. Mix the flour, 
cheese, salt and pepper and stir the mixture into the boiling liquid 
in the saucepan. Cook for three minutes, beating all the while; 
then remove from the fire and cool. Then add the eggs, unbeaten 
and one at a time. Beat batter five minutes. Butter a baking pan 
and drop a heaping teaspoonful of the mixture in it for each puff. 
Leave considerable space between them, as they rise to three, 
times their original size. Bake in a moderate oven for about 
twenty minutes. Serve hot. 

Mock Oyster Soup — One full cup of tomatoes, two-thirds cup 
of picked codfish (left-over cod will answer), two cups of boil- 
ing water, one tablespoonful of butter, a piece of soda size of two 
peas; boil all together twenty minutes; rub through a colander; 
return to saucepan with one cup of sweet milk added, and boil 



52 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

five minutes; season with salt and pepper to taste. Serve with 
crackers. 

Walled Chicken — One fowl, eight potatoes, medium-sized, two 
eggs, four tablespoonfuls of butter, half-cup of milk, three cupfuls 
of chicken stock (the water in which the fowl was boiled), one 
tablespoonful of chopped onion, one sprig of parsley, one slice of 
carrot, a bay leaf, two large tablespoonfuls of flour. Stew 
the fowl tender the day before using. Let it cool in the 
stock water, then free it from skin and bone and cut in pieces 
suitable for serving. Sprinkle with one-half teaspoonful of salt. 
Pare potatoes and put to boil an hour before dinner. Fifteen 
minutes after prepare the chicken thus: Put three tablespoonfuls 
of butter into a frying-pan with the vegetables and herbs and cook 
slowly for five minutes; add the flour and stir smooth. Do not 
brown it. Gradually add the cold chicken stock. When the liquid 
boils up add one-eighth teaspoonful of pepper and a half teaspoon- 
ful of salt; simmer flve minutes. Pour this sauce over the chicken; 
simmer ten minutes and keep hot. Cook potatoes one-half hour; 
pour off the water; heat the milk; mash smooth; add hot milk, 
one tablespoonful of butter and one-half teaspoonful of salt. Beat 
the whites of eggs to a froth and stir into the potato. Heat a 
stone-china platter; arrange the potato as a border around the 
center of the dish. Beat together the yolks of eggs and two table- 
spoonfuls of water and spread over the potato. Bake for ten 
minutes, then pour the chicken mixture into the center of the bor- 
der. Any kind of cold meat, game or flsh can be treated this 
way. 

Buttermilk Bread — One quart of sour buttermilk, one large 
tablespoonful of sugar, two teaspoonfuls of salt, three table- 
spoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful of soda, two quarts and three- 
quarters of flour. Heat the buttermilk to the boiling point, stir- 
ring frequently to prevent curdling. Add the sugar and pour in 
a large bowl. Now gradually sift into this mixture one quart of 
flour, • stirring constantly. Beat well, cover and let stand in a 
warm room over night, say from 9:30 p. m. to 6:30 a. m. In the 
morning dissolve the soda in three tablespoonfuls of water and 
add to the batter with the salt and butter melted. Beat thorough- 
ly; gradually beat in the remainder of the flour, reserving a half- 
cupful for kneading. Knead fifteen minutes. Divide into three 
parts and shape into loaves. Place in buttered pans and bake 
immediately one hour. 

Graham Fruit Pudding — Two cupfuls graham flour, one cup- 
ful of currants or raisins, one cupful sweet milk, one cupful 
molasses, one egg, one teaspoonful salt, one teaspoonful soda. 
Mix all together. Pour this thin batter into the pudding pail and 
boil two and one-half hours. 

Sauce — One tablespoonful of butter, the same of cornstarch, 
one cup of boiling water; mix. Add one-half cup of sugar and one 
tablespoonful of vinegar. Boil up once and serve.

Boston brown bread. 

Tea. 



DINNER. 

New England boiled dinner. 

Mustard sauce. 

Thinly sliced brown bread and butter. 

Apple and tapioca pudding.

Scrambled Eggs — Put eight tablespoonfuls of sweet milk in 
an earthen dish and set it on the range to heat. When it is near 
the boiling point add half a teaspoonful of salt and a small table- 
spoonful of butter. Break into this one at a time five eggs. Use 
a knife and stir gently from the sides and bottom of the dish until 
the eggs are well cooked, but not too hard. Serve on a hot platter 
with a little pepper sifted over them. 

Entire Wheat Muffins — Sift thoroughly with one and a half 
pints of entire wheat flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, 
half a teaspoonful of salt and one tablespoonful of sugar. Add 
to this three-quarters of a pint of sweet milk, to which has been 
added the well-beaten yolk of an egg and two tablespoonfuls of 
melted butter. After these ingredients are well mixed and just 
before putting into well-greased muffin rings add the white of the 
egg well beaten. Bake in a hot oven twenty minutes, or until 
nicely browned. 

Baked Beans — Soak over night one pint of small white or 
navy beans. In the morning put them to boil, with plenty of 
water to cover them, and add more if it becomes absorbed. Boil 
with them one-half pound of breakfast bacon, after having cut off 
the rind and outside. Let them boil gently until tender, but not soft 
enough to break to pieces; then, just before taking from the flre, 
add one-half teacupful New Orleans molasses. Let all boil up 
once, then pour into a buttered baking dish. Cut the bacon in 
slices and lay on top of beans. Put in a hot oven and bake until 
well browned, which will take from one and a half to two hours. 

New England Boiled Dinner — Three pounds of corned beef 
taken from the round. Wash it in cold water and put over the 



54 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

fire in a large kettle with siiftlcient cold water to cover it three 
or four inches. Set where it will slowly come to the boiling point. 
Skim well and let it boil slowly three hours. After the meat is 
put to cook, wash two or three beets carefully, without breaking 
the skin or cutting the roots, and put them to boil in another 
kettle with plenty of actually boiling water. Then peel two large 
white turnips and one small yellow one, cut in quarters, scrape 
two parsnips and two carrots and half a dozen good-sized potatoes; 
lay all in cold water until time to add them to the meat. Save 
half of the head of cabbage used for the co],d slaw, cut the stalk 
out without breaking the leaves apart, bind it with twine and 
keep it whole while cooking. The vegetables except the beets are 
to be added to the meat in proper succession, allowing sufficient 
time for each to cook. The carrots, parsnips and turnips will 
boil in about one hour, the cabbage in about the same time, the 
potatoes in about half an hour. The beets will take from two to 
three hours, according to size, and, if liked cold, may be cooked 
in the morning. When tender put in cold water for a few min- 
utes, rub off the skins, drain and slice crosswise and lay slices in 
a vegetable dish. Sprinkle salt over them and vinegar enough to 
almost cover them. When the boiled dinner is served put the 
meat in the center of a large platter and arrange the vegetables 
around it. A dish of stewed squash is liked by some with a boiled 
dinner. If the beef is not fresh corned, it should be soaked in 
plenty of water over night, and the water should also be changed 
several times during the cooking. 

Mustard Sauce — After the meat has been boiling two hours 
take a pint of the broth to use for the sauce. Peel and chop a 
small onion fine, add to the broth and boil half an hour; then add 
a tablespoonful of dry mustard, a gill of vinegar and a high sea- 
soning of salt and pepper. Stir the sauce until it is thoroughly 
incorporated and keep hot until required for the meat. The sauce 
is a very nice addition to corned beef. 

Apple and Tapioca Pudding — This may be made in the morn- 
ing, for it is best cold. Soak one teacupful of pearl tapioca over 
night in water; peel half a dozen tart apples, cut in quarters, lay 
in a buttered pudding dish, sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, 
pour the tapioca over the apple, sprinkle again with the sugar, 
add a few bits of butter and water enough to come up over the 
apples; cover and bake one hour; serve with sugar.

a frying-pan ; when hot fill with the cakes, fry until nicely browned 
on both sides; remove frdm the pan, add a tablespoonful of flour 
to the fat in the pan. Mix, add a small cup of milk. Stir until it 
boils, season with salt and pepper and pour over the sausages. 

Baked Apples — Wash three good-sized sweet apples and halve 
them from stem to blossom. Do not peel, but remove cores and 
fill with currant jelly. Bake until apples are tender and serve 
with sugar and cream. 

Corn Muflins — One cup yellow cornmeal, one-half cup of fiour, 
one large tablespoonful of sugar, one and one-half teaspoonfuls 
baking powder, one beaten egg, one and one-half cups of sweet 
milk, a saltspoonful salt; bake in hot greased gem pans. 

Rumbled Eggs^Take a small tablespoonful of butter and two 
of cream or milk, warm in a frying-pan. Break four eggs, or more 
if needed, in the pan and stir until slightly cooked; then add four 
sardines broken in small pieces, from which the skin and large 
bones have been removed. Pour over one-half tablespoonful of 
Worcestershire sauce and serve hot. A good recipe for cooking in 
chafing dish. 

Fig Jam — Take one pound of good figs, chop fine and put 
them on to cook with half a pound of sugar, one cup of water 
and half a grated nutmeg. Cook until thick; place in a wet mold, 
and when cold they are ready to serve. Will keep some time if 
put in glasses and sealed. 

Puree of Carrots — Boil enough carrots to make a pint after 
being rubbed through a colander. Put one and one-half pints 
of milk, carrots and a saltspoonful of salt over the fire; when 
boiling add three small tablespoonfuls of fiour rubbed smooth 
in a little cold milk; stir constantly as it boils; add a teaspoon- 
ful of butter and a dash of pepper just before taking from fire. 

Roast Mutton — Boil a neck piece of mutton until so tender 
that the bones will slip out; then press the meat closely together, 
shaping nicely with the hands. Place in a dripping-pan, and over 



56 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

the meat spread a thick dressing of bread crumbs seasoned with 
butter, salt, pepper and sage, and pour in the pan the pot liquor; 
bake until brown, basting frequently. A nice dish at a small 
expense, and is excellent sliced cold for luncheon. Beef may 
be prepared in the same way. 

Date Pudding — Shred and chop fine one cup of suet. Beat 
the suet, one cup of sugar and the yolks of two eggs together 
until light, then add one cup of milk and three cups of flour. 
Beat until smooth, add one teaspoonful of cinnamon, half a tea- 
spoonful salt, half a nutmeg grated, the well-beaten whites of the 
eggs and a teaspoonful of baking powder. Mix well and add one 
pound of washed, stoned and chopped dates, slightly floured; 
turn into a greased mold and boil continuously for three hours. 
Serve hot with hard sauce. Mrs. Marion C. Wilson.

one teacupful of chopped dates, scalded and stoned, or a cupful 
of figs treated in the same way, or a cup of canned blackberries, 
drained and sweetened, with a tablespoonful of the juice. Plain 
graham mush is excellent cut in slices, when cold, dipped in 
beaten egg and rolled bread crumbs, and fried in hot lard. 

Breakfast Shortcake— Sift and mix thoroughly a scant quart 
of fiour, two heapefd teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, one teaspoon- 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 57 

ful of salt, one teaspoonful of sugar; rub into this one tablespoon- 
ful each of lard and butter and add sweet milk enough to form, 
a dough just stiff enough to roll out; roll rather less than half 
an inch thick and bake in light layer-cake pans; have ready two 
teacups of finely chopped meat and one-half teacup chopped or 
mashed cold potato; heat this on a skillet, with a large table- 
spoonful of butter, a half-teacup water, a cup milk, a quarter tea- 
spoonful salt, a good pinch of pepper; thicken this with a tea- 
spoonful each of flour and butter rubbed together; spilt the 
cakes, butter them, and spread the creamed meat between; there 
will be three thin layers, and if liked one can be reserved to have 
a layer of berries, peaches, prunes or other fruit between and 
sprinkled with sugar while hot. 

Fried Cornmeal Muffins — Mix one pint sifted Indian meal 
with one-half teaspoonful salt and one tablespoonful of sugar; 
pour gradually on this one pint boiling water; cover after beating 
well and set away until morning; add two well-beaten eggs; beat 
thoroughly; dip a tablespoon in cold milk and with the wet spoon 
dip up the batter by the tablespoonful and fry in boiling lard; 
turn each once while cooking. ^ 

Curried Rabbit — Joint and soak a rabbit half an hour in cold, 
salted water. Drain and put into a saucepan with a quarter- 
pound of salt pork cut into strips, and a medium-sized onion, 
sliced fine. Stew slowly in just enough cold water to cover, about 
an hour, or until tender. Boil a teacup of rice in three cups of 
water in a separate vessel; when nearly done add half the juice 
of a can of tomatoes and let it cook slowly until the rice has ab- 
sorbed the juice. When the rabbit is tender add to the rice a 
tablespoonful of butter, one of cream, a half teaspoonful of salt 
and a good pinch of curry powder and make a border two inches 
high of the rice around a very hot platter. Take out the rabbit 
and strips of pork, lay them inside the wall of rice; add to the 
gravy in the saucepan a cup of milk, a tablespoonful of butter, 
a teaspoonful of curry powder; thicken with a tabtespoonful of 
flour rubbed smooth in a very little cold milk; add the traditional 
squeeze of lemon juice, without v/hich no curry is complete, boil 
up and stir; pour over the rabbit and serve at once. 

Potato Omelet (no eggs) — Boil and mash nine medium-sized 
potatoes; beat until light and foamy. Add one level teaspoonful 
of salt, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one-third teaspoonful of 
pepper, one-half cup of hot milk; put one large tablespoonful of 
butter into the frying-pan; heat, but do not brown; turn the potato 
mixture into . it, spreading smoothly. Cover and set the pan 
where the omelet will brown slowly and steadily. It will take 
about ten minutes. Fold it, turn on a very hot dish. Do not let 
it wait a moment after taking it up. 

Brown Biscuit — Set a dough over night of two cups of graham 
flour, one cup white flour, one cup milk, two tablespoonfuls of 
brown sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, four tablespoonfuls good 
yeast; in the morning knead, adding one large tablespoonful 
melted butter, one-half teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot water 



58 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

before kneading; cover closely; keep moderately warm; one hour 
before lunch roll out a half-inch thick, cut with a cake cutter, 
range in a greased pan, glazing the tops with melted butter; bake 
quickly when light. 

Fruit Pin-Wheels — Roll out pie crust thin, and cut into strips 
about three inches wide and six or eight inches long; spread 
with marmalade, peach butter or thick jam or firm jelly; roll 
up, fasten the edges firmly and bake in a quick oven; when 
sliced across the little spirals are very pretty. 

White Soup — Boil four large potatoes, six tomatoes, four 
small onions, in two quarts of water until soft; rub through a 
colander; add four tablespoonfuls crushed tapioca. Boil twenty 
minutes longer; then add two tablespoonfuls butter, one tea- 
spoonful each salt and sweet marjoram and a half-teaspoonful 
pepper. Heat a pint and a half of milk; thicken with a teaspoon- 
ful each butter and flour rubbed together; pour this into the 
soup; boil up; pour into a hot tureen and serve with small 
squares of toasted bread. This is sufficient for at least two din- 
ners. 

Sponge Steak — Put two and one-half pounds of round steak 
into a covered saucepan with just as little cold water as will 
answer and let it cook slowly until it falls to pieces. Remove 
bones, fat and gristle and mince "exceeding fine"; add one 
small teaspoonful salt, one-fourth teaspoonful pepper, one table- 
spoonful catchup, one pinch nutmeg. Press out the juice, work 
in one unbeaten egg and form into cakes four inches long by three 
wide. Brown in hot butter and lay on a bed of parsley. Add to the 
juice a full tablespoonful butter, a cup of milk, a half-cup water, 
one-third teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoon of pepper; thicken 
slightly and pour round the steak. A half-can of mushrooms or 
a dozen oysters with their liquor make a nice sauce for this ex- 
cellent steak. 

Winter Succotash — Soak a pint each of dried corn and lima 
beans over night. Next day cook them separately until tender. 
A pinch of soda in each vessel hastens the process. Cut a thin 
slice of salt pork into tiny dice and divide it between them. 
When they are tender put them together, adding a large cupful 
of rich milk, a great spoonful of butter, a half-teaspoonful of 
salt and a tablespoonful of flour. Many prefer a can of sweet 
corn to the dried. Let the milk boil up once, then turn into a 
hot dish. 

Parsnip Fritters — Scrape and boil tender two large parsnips. 
Rub through a colander and mash. Beat in one egg, two table- 
spoonfuls of milk, two teaspoonfuls of flour, one-half teaspoonful 
of salt, one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper. Make into small, flat 
cakes, flour slightly and fry on a griddle in butter or good drip- 
ping. Brown on both sides. 

Creamed Peach Tart — Line*' a deep pie dish with good pie 
crust and nearly flll it (two-thirds full) with slices of canned 
peaches that have been dropped into boiling sirup and cooked 
for two or three minutes. Cover with not the very thinnest 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 59 

crust and do not pinch down the edges. When done allow it to 
cool, raise up the top crust and pour in the follov/ing cream, 
which should cool for a few moments before being poured in: 
One small cupful of milk, heated to boiling; one tablespoonful 
of white sugar, one-half teaspoonful of cornstarch wet in cold 
milk. Let it boil well, then add the whites of two eggs beaten to 
a stiff froth before removing from the fire, then add one-fourth 
teaspoonful of vanilla. Mrs. Mary J. Bouton.

of sugar. Stir well a,nd strain into molds. Serve very cold, with 
cream and sugar. 

Oyster Salad — Boil a pint of oysters in their own liquor until 
they plump. Drain, cool, chop and mix with an equal amount 
of celery or lettuce. Pour on mayonnaise dressing, and serve 
with wafers. 

Apple Snow — Core and quarter, but do not pare, three large 
tart apples. Stew until tender and rub through a fine sieve. Beat 
the whites of three eggs stiff, add one-half cup of powdered sugar, 
and beat again. Add the apple and beat until like snow. Pile 
lightly in a dish and serve v/ith the following sauce:

Meat Slices — Place about a dozen thin slices of any cold roast 
or boiled meat (this has special reference to the roast described 
below) in a saucepan. Sprinkle over this a teaspoonful of flour, 
bits of butter, and a pinch of salt and pepper. Pour over all a 
small half-cup of water. Cover and bring to heat just sufficient 
to cook the gravy. This is nice for a luncheon dish, with eight 
sliced olives warmed with the gravy. 

Peas on Toast — Pour a can of sweet, small peas into a sauce- 
pan to cook until tender. Into this stir the following: A half- 
cup butter, beaten to a cream, with a tablespoonful of flour, and 
a quarter teaspoon of salt. Add a half -cup of hot water. Pour the 
peas and gravy over six light-brown slices of toast, arranged on 
a large platter. Serve quite hot. 

Steamed Graham Bread — Place slices of stale bread side by 
side in a steamer or colander over a kettle of water and cover 
over the top with folded clean cloth. Steam only long enough 
to make bread moist and hot. 

Vanities — Beat two eggs very light, add half teaspoon of salt 
and flour to roll. Take a piece of dough as large as a hickory 
nut, roll as thin as paper, cut and fry in hot lard. They will 
be done in a few seconds. Sprinkle with powdered sugar. This 
will make enough for two luncheons (rewarming the second 
day in a hot oven a moment). They are crisp and light. 

Malted Milk — This very healthful drink can be easily made, 
from directions on the bottles which all druggists keep. 

Steamed Beef — Have ribs only removed from a two-rib roast. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 61 

Roll up and tie witii' a cord. Rinse in boiling water. Place it 
in an inch of boiling water in a tbree-quart tin pan whose depth 
equals the height of the beef. Cover tightly and set in a mod- 
erate oven for three hours. After it has cooked about an hour 
sprinkle with a small teaspoon of salt. It needs no watching. 
When done let it stand for ten minutes in a hot oven uncovered. 
This is more tender than the usual roast and richer in nourish- 
ment than a boiled piece. Remove the meat and thicken the 
liquid in pan with one and a half tablespoons of flour. The 
gravy that is not wanted for dinner should be poured over the 
meat. The meat will be nice in any way for the next day. 

Creamed Parsnips — Peel and cut in two six medium-sized 
parsnips, slice lengthwise. Cook two sliced sweet potatoes with 
these. Y/hen tender add hot water enough to the water in which 
they were boiled to make about a cupful. Stir in a large table- 
spoonful of butter mixed with a tablespoonful of flour and yolk 
,of an egg, quarter of a teaspoonful of salt and a pinch of pepper. 
Boil one moment. Delicious. 

Apple Pudding — Six large, pleasant apples, slice thin, lay in 
a pudding-dish. Bring quart of skim milk to boiling point. Stir 
in two dessert spoonfuls of cornstarch wet in a little cold milk. 
When smooth and thick remove from fire. Carefully stir in two 
well-beaten eggs and a half-cup of sugar. Pour this custard over 
the apples and bake until tender. Serve cold with the cream 
taken from the milk, sweetened and flavored to taste.

62 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Fried Mush — Slice well-cooked mush (^tiff enough to mold 
nicely in greased pan or dish about one-quarter inch thick. Cut 
in neat squares or oblongs. Drop in smoking hot fat as you 
would French-fry potatoes. When a delicate brown lay on paper 
a few minutes. Serve with or without maple sirup. Cook enough 
mush for several mornings. It keeps well in a cold place. 

Doughnuts — Three-fourths of a cup of granulated sugar, two 
eggs beaten separately, one cup of sweet milk, three tablespoon- 
fuls of melted shortening, three cupfuls of flour, three heaping 
teaspoonfuls of baking powder, half-teaspoon of grated nutmeg. 
Mix as for good cake, reserving beaten v/hites till last. Then 
work in two more cupfuls of flour. The dough should be quite 
stiff, so as not to absorb much fat while frying. This should 
make about 50 cents worth of doughnuts, counting them at 10 
cents a dozen, if the dough is rolled sufficiently thin— about one- 
fourth inch — as they become very light while cooking. 

London Potatoes — Fry slices of cold potato, about one-fourth 
inch thick, till a nice brown; lay them on a hot dish and place 
on each piece a thin slice of hard-boiled egg, allowing two eggs 
for five persons. Pour over all the following, hot: 

Sauce Piquante — Melt a tablespoonful of butter; sift in two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, stirring all the time; add salt and pepper 
to taste, and then gradually one gill of water and one gill of 
vinegar; stir well until the sauce has boiled a few moments. 
A little parsley may be added. 

French Beans — Soak a pint of navy beans over night; put 
on to boil in one quart of fresh water; at the end of half an 
hour add one teaspoonful, or less, salt and boil again gently and 
without breaking for another half or three-fourths of an hour; 
meanwhile, cook a very small sliced onion in a cupful of tomato 
juice; strain or not, as you choose; about this time the beans 
are done; thicken this with flour and butter; put in half the 
beans, well drained; re-heat and serve. 

Bean Soup — Thoroughly mash the remaining half of the 
beans; return them to the liquor with a small minced onion and 
a small handful of celery tops, dried and saved for soups; add 
water or stock if there is not enough bean liquor; season to 
taste. 

Jellied Chicken — Use the remnants of chicken -from the pre- 
vious day's dinner and all the clean bones, or save out the wings, 
back, neck, liver, gizzard, etc., for this purpose. Stew until the 
meat readily drops from the bones. Juice of half an onion is 
an improvement. Drain and chop the meat, not too fine, and 
mix in a little celery seed and a half teaspoonful of salt, half that 
amount of pepper. Return the bones and liquor to boil down 
until you have just sufficient to wet the chicken, which you have 
meantime arranged in a dish to mold. Have three layers of 
chicken in the mold. In the two spaces between them put thin 
slices of hard boiled egg. Put in a cold place. One egg is suffi-

cient. It may be omitted. This is so rich it should be enough 
for two days. 

Baked Tomatoes — The tomatoes from which the juice was 
drained at luncheon should be drained again if still wet. Put a 
thin layer of fine bread crumbs in a well-greased baking dish, a 
thick layer of tomatoes, just enough minced onion to flavor deli- 
cately, many tiny bits of butter, salt, pepper and another thin 
layer of bread crumbs. Repeat until the dish is full, having 
crumbs on top. Bake slowly about an hour. 

Salad — Some string beans and boiled cabbage left from yes- 
terday's dinner; and some beets pickled last fall, coarsely 
chopped; a tablespoonful or more piled on small lettuce leaves 
on each of the necessary number of individual plates and a thin 
mayonnaise dressing over all. The lettuce can be raised in a 
roomy window-box in a sunny window, where it looks very 
pretty growing. A few leaves may be cut at a time as needed, 
the roots left to send up more leaves. 

Dainty Dessert — One and one-half pints of milk, two eggs, 
two level tablespoonfuls of corn starch, two tablespoonfuls of 
granulated sugar, two dessertspoonfuls of pulverized sugar. Boil 
half the milk in a double boiler, add the corn starch rubbed 
smooth in a little cold milk", the granulated sugar and the whites 
of eggs beaten stiff. Whip the last in lightly and remove at 
once from the fire. Flavor with almond. Put in wet cups and 
set away to cool. Boil the remaining half of the milk in the 
double boiler. Stir in the beaten yolks and pulverized sugar. 
Strain into a pitcher, flavor with vanilla and set away to cool. 
When serving, pour custard around each mold.

Potatoes baked with veal. 

Scalloped parsnips. 

Plum-pudding croquettes. 

Lemon sauce. 

Coffee. 



Croquettes of Odds and Ends — These are made of any scraps 
or bits of good food left over from several meals, so little of each 
that they cannot be made use of separately. For instance, two 
spoonfuls of frizzled or creamed beef, one mutton chop, two hard- 
boiled feggs, a spoonful of cold rice or oatmeal. Remove all skin 
and gristle from the meat, chop it fine, use cold potato or rice 
in proportion of tv/o-thirds meat to one of potato; add a beaten 
egg and a very few bread crumbs; m^oisten if necessary with a 
little cold milk; season with salt, pepper and catchup, mold into 
croquettes, dip first into beaten egg, then into rolled bread 
crumbs, fry in hot lard. A little cold chicken, a part of a baked 
apple, improve the croquettes. 

Crushed Wheat Griddle Cakes — To one large cupful of cooked 
crushed wheat add one pint of milk and one well-beaten egg. 
Sift together one and one-half pints of flour, one teaspoonful 
sugar, one-half teaspoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder, add gradually to the crushed wheat. Bake on a hot 
griddle. 

Figs and Dates — Stone enough dates to fill a teacup; chop 
in half enough figs for two cups. Wash both in warm water; 
then put into a saucepan with as little cold water as may be, 
just enough to keep them from burning. Steam for about twenty 
minutes. For most palates they will not need sugar, but if a rich 
sirup is wished put a teacup of sugar into the saucepan when the 
fruit is half cooked. 

Hot Slaw — Chop half an ordinary cabbage fine and sprinkle 
lightly with fiour. Melt one tablespoonful of butter in the oven; 
put the cabbage into it and replace in the oven. Mix one table- 
spoonful of mustard, one teaspoonful of sugar, one tablespoonful 
of olive oil or melted butter, one beaten egg and three-fourths 
cup of cream. Heat thoroughly; pour over the slaw, after sprink- 
ling it with salt and pepper; put into a hot dish and serve. 

Italian Afternoon Cake — One cup of sugar, one-half cup of 
butter, one cup of milk, three eggs, -one cup of raisins, currants 
and citron mixed and chopped fine, three cups of fiour, two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, mixed with the fiour; flavor with 
nutmeg and cinnamon. Beat well, bake in small pans or gem 
pans. Eat warm with hot chocolate. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 65 

Cream of Pea Soup — Cook a can of green peas in just enough 
hot water to cover, together with a small onion cut up fine, 
until tender. Mash and add a pint of stock, or water; of course 
stock is best. Cook together until smooth, but not brown, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter and one of flour. Add to the peas with 
a coffee cup of rich milk and one of cream. Season with a half- 
teaspoonful of salt and a quarter-teaspoonful of pepper. Allow 
it to boil up once. Strain and serve. A teacup of whipped 
cream added the last minute is a most delightful addition. Ten 
cents' worth of cream will do for both pea soup and parsnips. 

Stuffed Shoulder or Breast of Veal, with Chestnut Dressing — 
Remove the bone from the shoulder of veal without cutting 
through the outer skin. Take the shells from twelve large chest- 
nuts, boil and mash the chestnuts, add to them a large teacup 
of fine bread crumbs, a tablespoonful of butter, a half-teaspoonful 
of salt, a little pepper, a tablespoonful hot water, juice of half 
a lemon, a little catchup if liked. Put this dressing where the 
bone was, sew and truss the shoulder into shape, put into a 
baking-pan, the bones under it. Dredge with fiour, put a large 
tablespoon butter and a small cup hot water into the pan. Bake 
it, allowing twenty minutes to the pound, basting occasionally. 
An hour before the veal is done pare twelve medium-sized pota- 
toes and put them around the veal. As soon as they are half done 
turn them so that they may bake evenly. When they are ready 
range them round a hot platter, lay the veal in the center. Put 
a tablespoonful each of butter and flour rubbed together into the 
baking-pan, brown this, then add gradually one pint boiling 
water, a scant teaspbonful salt, a half-teaspoonful pepper. Stir, 
let it boil up once and serve with meat and potatoes. Five cents' 
worth large chestnuts will make enough dressing. Breast of 
veal may be used instead of shoulder. 

Tomato Sauce — Put one pint stewed tomatoes, with one small 
onion, sliced fine, a bay leaf, a sprig of parsley and a blade of 
mace, on to cook and simmer slowly for ten minutes. Melt three 
teaspoonfuls butter, add to one tablespoonful flour, mix until 
smooth. Mash tomato through colander or sieve, add flour and 
butter, with a half-teaspoonful salt and a quarter-teaspoonful 
pepper; stir for a moment and then pour into a hot dish. 

Scalloped Parsnips — Scrape and boil until tender. This will 
take about forty-five minutes. Mash while hot a sufiicient num- 
ber to make a pint. Beat into this two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
two of cream, a well-beaten egg, one heaping teaspoonful of 
salt, a little pepper. Butter a dish and put in a layer of crumbs, 
pour in a good layer of the parsnips, then a layer of crumbs, 
until the pan is full, using a layer of crumbs last. Sprinkle a very 
little salt and pepper over the last layer, add a tablespoonful 
each of melted butter, milk and hot water, and brown rapidly 
in the oven. 

Plum-Pudding Croquettes — Put a pint of milk in a sauce- 
pan on a part of the range where it will be warm but not hot. 



66 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Crumb enougli stale bread into it to take up the milk — about a 
teacupful of crumbs. Let it soften, then add one well-beaten 
egg, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one-quarter teaspoonful of salt, 
one-eighth teaspoonful of nutmeg, one pinch each of cinnamon and 
cloves, one cupful of chopped fruit, raisins, currants, citron or 
soft stoned prunes or dates. Set aside until perfectly cold, then 
form into croquettes, using as little flour as possible. Beat an 
egg very light and mix with it one tablespoonful of boiling 
water — the yolk alone makes too heavy a crust for these delicate 
croquettes. Do not roll the croquettes in the cracker crumbs, but 
sift the crumbs over the croquettes after dipping into the egg. 
Fry carefully in hot lard, using the wire basket if at hand. 

Lemon Sauce — Beat three-quarters of a cupful of butter with 
a cupful and a half of sugar and two tablespoonfuls of flour. 
Pour over this three-quarters of a pint of boiling water. Stir 
until a perfectly smooth liquid; add the juice of a large lemon. 
If preferred, cut the lemon in thin slices, without peeling, and 
put into the sauce; remove the seeds.

fore, slice, dip in grated bread crumbs or sifted corn meal, fry 
brown in bacon gravy; serve with slice of bacon laid on top 
each piece. 

Graham Muffins — Take one quart of graham flour, one table- 
spoonful brown sugar, one teaspoonful salt, two heaping tea- 
spoonfuls baking powder, one egg, one pint of milk; sift together 
graham, sugar, salt and powder; add beaten egg and milk; mix 
into a batter like pound cake; fill well-greased muffin pans two- 
thirds full; bake in a hot oven twenty minutes. 

Oyster Toast — Boil one cup of oyster liquor with half a cup 
of milk or cream, one tablespoonful of butter, one-fourth tea- 
spoonful salt, pepper size of a pea; pour over some nicely toasted 
bread and set in the oven five minutes, then lay broiled oysters 
on the slices of toast and serve hot. 

Potato Salad — Take any cold potatoes that may be left over, 
either boiled or mashed; to one-half dozen cold boiled potatoes, 
add one raw onion, chop fine, add one teaspoonful mustard, one- 
half teaspoonful salt. Add enough olive oil or melted butter 
sufficient to make into a paste by mixing thoroughly; to this 
add a cup of vinegar so as to dilute. The vinegar must be added 
very gradually and be well beaten with the paste. 

Soft Gingerbread — Take one-half cup butter, two cupfuls mo- 
lasses, one cup of sugar, four cupfuls flour, one cupful milk, 
four eggs, one teaspoonful baking powder, one of ginger, one-half 
teaspoonful of cloves. Cream the butter and sugar as in making 
other cake, then stir in milk and molasses; then beat in the 
flour (to which the baking powder has been added) a little at 
a time, lastly adding the eggs (well beaten), ginger and cloves. 
Bake in a moderate oven; if baked in one large loaf bake for 
one hour; if in two smaller ones bake one-half hour. Serve 
warm. (This recipe will be enough for two or three luncheons.) 

Apple Sauce — Pare, core and quarter one-half dozen nice 
juicy apples. Stew in v/ater enough to cover until the pieces 
break. Beat to a pulp vv^ith a good lump of butter and one cup 
of sugar, or more if the fruit is very sour. Serve cold. The juice 
of a lemon impraves it greatly. 

Russian Tea — Pare and slice one good, juicy lemon and lay a 
piece in each cup; sprinkle with white sugar and pour hot, strong 
tea upon it. Do not use cream. 

Lemon-Cream Pie — Take one tablespoonful flour, two-thirds 
of a teacupful water, one teacupful of sugar, yolks of two eggs 
and one lemon. Grate the rind of the lemon and squeeze out 
the juice; mix flour and sugar and grated rind of lemon, then 
add yolks of eggs, v/ell beaten, and water; cook over a slow flre 
until it becomes thick; make pie crust and line pie plate, and 
bake the crust for ten minutes; take out and put lemon filling 
in; return to oven for five minutes; beat the whites to a stiff 
froth, with one-half teacup sugar. Spread over the pie and brown 
nicely. Mrs. E. H. Guise.

Creamed Chip Beef — Take one-half pound of chip beef, cut 
very thin, pull apart and put in chopping bowl and chop flne; 
have your skillet hot, put in a dessertspoon of butter; let melt, 
then dredge in flour, stirring until brown; then add one pint of 
milk and let it come to a boil, put in the meat and let it cook in 
it; the milk around it should be like a rich cream when done; 
add parsley chopped fine when it is taken off flre.

cups of sweet milk, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, a spoon- 
ful of yeast powder, three cups of flour and one egg well beaten.

ley minced very fine. Serve in hot dish. Thicken the milk a lit- 
tle if necessary. 

Fried Salsify — Scrape the salsify, cut in pieces and boil until 
tender; mash, adding milk (one cup), one egg well beaten, a 
small piece of butter, salt and a little sifted flour (this is for one 
bunch of salsify) ; bake like griddle cakes on hot greased griddle. 

Baltimore Pudding — Ten cents' worth of stale sponge cake,

Graham Puffs— Two cups graham flour, one tablespoonful 
melted butter, two eggs, one quart milk, one-half teaspoonful 
salt, one teaspoonful of baking powder. Sift together the flour 
and' baking powder; add butter and salt to the milk and drop 
in the eggs, without beating. Beat into this the prepared flour, 
making a smooth paste as stiff as for griddle cakes. Drop into 
hot and well-greased gem pans and bake at once in a hot oven. 
Fried Apple Sauce— Put a small piece of butter into a frying- 
pan and let it brown without burning. Wash a half-dozen apples 
and slice them without pariilg. Put them into the heated butter 
and sprinkle on them a pinch of salt and a tablespoonful of 
sugar. Add a half-cupful of water and cover closely. When the 
apples are tender stir them gently about until they are well 
mixed and serve hot. A delicious and easily prepared dish for 
either luncheon or breakfast. 

Finnan Haddies— Brush the fish over with butter and pepper 
it well; then broil or toast until it is cooked through. Another 
way, equally good, is to pour boiling water over the fish from 
the teakettle; take it out of the water, lay it on a baking-pan, 
brush over with butter and pepper and bake in a hot oven about 
eight or ten minutes. 

Bread Sticks— One quart flour, two teaspoonfuls baking pow- 
der, one-quarter cupful melted butter, one heaping tablespoonful 
sugar, one and one-half cupfuls scalded milk, three whites of 
eggs, a little salt. Sift together flour, salt and baking powder. 
Beat butter, sugar and milk together and add it to the flour. 
Beat up the eggs and work them into the dough; turn out on a 
floured board; divide into pieces as large as an egg and with 
the hands slightly buttered roll them into long, thin sticks. 
Bake them hard and crisp in a very hot oven. 

Chocolate Pie — Three tablespoonfuls grated chocolate, one 
cup milk, one teaspoonful cornstarch, three eggs, four tablespoon- 
fuls sugar, a saltspoonful salt, one teaspoonful vanilla. Rub the 
chocolate smooth in the milk and heat to boiling; then stir in 
the cornstarch. Stir until well thickened; take from the fire 
and let cool. Beat the yolks of the eggs well with the sugar, 
and when the chocolate mixture is cool add salt and vanilla; put 
all together and whip up light. Bake with one crust. When done 
cover with meringue made of the whites of the eggs and three 
tablespoonfuls of sugar. Return to the oven and brown. 

Oatmeal Soup — Two quarts of any meat broth, one-half can 
tomatoes, one medium-sized onion, salt and pepper to taste, a 
stalk or two of celery (if at hand), one and one-half teacupfuls 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 71 

of oatmeal. Put broth, vegetables and seasoning over the fire 
together and let come to a boil; then throw in the oatmeal and 
stir smooth. Boil until as thick as cream, then strain through 
a colander and serve. 

Fillet of Beef a la Hollandaise — Trim and cut the short fillet 
into slices about half an inch thick. Season them well with salt 
and lay them in a pan with six tablespoonfuls butter, just warm 
enough to be oily. Squeeze the juice of a quarter of a lemon over 
them. Let them stand one hour, then dip them lightly in flour, 
place in a double broiler and cook for six minutes over a bright 
fire. Have a mound of mashed potato in the center of a hot dish 
and rest the slices against it. Pour a Hollandaise sauce around 
and garnish with parsley. 

Macaroni, with Tomato — Two quarts boiling water, one table- 
spoonful salt and twelve sticks of macaroni. Break and wash 
the macaroni and boil it rapidly in the salted water for twenty- 
five minutes. Drain dry. Have ready, heated, the half-can of 
tomatoes left from the soup, and, having seasoned this with salt/ 
pepper and butter, pour it over the macaroni and serve. 

Apple John — One pint flour, two teaspoonfuls baking powder, 
two tablespoonfuls butter, one cup milk, one quart apples cut in 
eighths. Sift flour and baking powder together. Rub in the but- 
ter and mix to the consistency of biscuit dough with the milk. 
Roll out to fit the plate upon which it is to be baked. Have the 
apples ready, peeled and cut; put them in a deep pie-plate and 
put the crust on top and bake. When done, reverse it and cover 
with sugar, spice and butter. Serve with cream.

Tripe — Cut one pound of boiled tripe into pieces about one 
inch square; fry out the fat from a quarter of a pound of bacon, 
and set the bacon away. Season the tripe with salt and pepper, 
and cover it with flour, and brown in the hot fat; take it care- 
fully out of the fat and place on a hot dish; add a teaspoonful of 
flour to the fat, and a quarter pint of stock or water, and half 
a dozen mushrooms chopped fine; stir until it boils, then add a 
teaspoonful of vinegar; salt and pepper to taste; pour over the

Apple Salad — Peel, core and slice four or five tart apples; 
mix with them half a thinly sliced lemon; place in salad dish 
and serve very cold, covered with a French dressing made as 
follows: 

French Dressing — One saltspoonful of salt, one-half saltspoon- 
ful pepper, three tablespoonfuls oil, one-quarter teaspoonful onion 
juice, one tablespoonful vinegar, a dash of cayenne pepper. Add 
the oil slowly. 

Gingerbread — Warm one-half scant cup of butter, one cup 
of molasses, one-half cup brown sugar, one-half teaspoonful 
mixed cinnamon and mace, one tablespoonful ground ginger, 
slightly together, and stir to a yellow brown cream; add half 
a cup of milk, two beaten eggs, and one level teaspoonful of soda 
dissolved in the milk, and two and a half cups of fiour; beat well 
and bake in a large shallow pan. 

Chowder — Pick up one-half pint of codfish, soak over night, 
change the water several times in the morning. Set the fish 
aside, and when ready to use, pare and thinly slice one pint of 
raw potatoes, one large onion, put in hot buttered dish, alternate 
layers of fish, potatoes, onions and one cracker pressed to crumbs. 
Cover all with hot water and boil twenty minutes; then add 
salt to taste, a pint of milk, a little cream, if possible. Serve in 
soup plates with hot toasted cracker. Any cold fish left from 
yesterday's dinner may be used. 

Broiled Venison — Steaks cut from the saddle or loin are the 
choicest, but those cut from the leg are very nice if properly 
cooked. Venison should be wiped carefully before cooking, as 
hairs are often found clinging to the meat; broil same as beef- 
steak, and serve very hot with — 

Maitre d'Hotel Sauce — Make one teacupful of drawn butter 
sauce. Add to this half a glass of currant jelly; a little chopped 
parsley, minced onion, and thyme, cayenne pepper and salt; beat 
while simmering. 

Shortcake — Stew slowly one pound of prunes until soft; 
strain, and return the liquid to the dish, adding half a cup of 
sugar. While this is simmering remove the stones from prunes, 
then return to the liquid and simmer altogether about ten min- 
utes. Make a crust with one-half more shortening than for bis- 
cuit; bake in one piece; split and butter, after baking; spread 
with the prunes and serve with or without —

hard. Let cool and remove the shells. Chop eggs and potatoes 
together rather coarsely. Season with pepper and salt, put in 
a saucepan over the fire with one good spoon of butter and two

tablespoon of Worcestershire sauce, one teaspoon of lemon 
juice, and serve. This is a nice way to use cold roasts, espe-

corns, a sprig of sweet herb, up in a muslin cloth. Put in a saucer 
a tablespoon of salt, a teaspoon of sugar, and a saltspoon of 
pepper; mix. Have ready a jar with a cover, such as is used 
for baking beans. Put all these ingredients in alternate layers

one cup of hot water. Keep the oven well heated. Baste every 
fifteen minutes with butter and water. Twenty minutes before 
serving remove the paste and paper, and dredge with a spoon 
(tea) of salt, and some flour, and baste with butter until brown. 
Pour in a pint of water and make a thickened gravy as for roast 
beef. Add a pinch each of cloves, nutmeg, mace; stir in two 
tablespoonfuls of currant jelly; strain; send to table in hot 
dishes. Venison cools quickly, so be sure plates are well heated. 

Apple Pot Pie — Pill a basin one-third full of tart apples, 
pared, quartered and cored. Pour boiling water over them and 
set on stove to cook. When they begin to boil, put over them a 
crust made as for biscuit, cover closely, cook twenty minutes.

well-greased pan and bake' in a hot oven. The batter should be 
thick enough to just flatten on the bottom, leaving them quite 
high in the center. 

Cod au Fromage — Mix one cup of cold boiled macaroni (broken 
into short pieces) and one cup of cold boiled codfish, and put 
in buttered baking dish; lay bits of butter (use half the size 
of an egg in all), a saltspoonful of salt, also of pepper, over it; 
use sufficient milk or cold-drawn butter should you chance to 
have it, to moisten— about half a cupful; cover with fine bread 
crumbs' and sprinkle three tablespoonfuls of grated cheese on 
top. Bake until brown. 

Apple Fritters, Maple Sirup— Beat the yolks of two eggs, a 
tablespoonful of sugar and a saltspoonful of salt until light. Heat 
one cupful of milk a little more than blood warm, add it slowly 
to the yolks and sugar. Sift a heaping teaspoonful of baking 
powder v/ith two cups of flour and stir into liquid mixture; then 
beat in the whites of the eggs, stiffly whipped; lastly, stir in four 
good apples, peeled, cored and thinly sliced. Drop by large spoon- 
fuls into boiling fat with pieces of apple in each, fry a light brown 
and serve with maple sirup. 

Tomato Soup — Stew one quart of tomatoes and one pint of 
water for twenty minutes; rub two tablespoonfuls of flour and 
one of butter, with a teaspoonful of salt and one of sugar; stir 
into the boiling tomato and cook flfteen minutes; rub through 
a colander and serve with sippets of bread. Cut stale bread thin 
slices, butter and cut into small dice, place in pan with buttered 
side up and brown crisply in the oven. 

Whitefish au Gratin — Parboil a three-pound whitefish and 
pick apart in large flakes. Make a sauce of one pint of milk, 
two eggs, a heaping tablespoonful of corn starch, two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, a level teaspoonful of salt and a third of that 
quantity of white pepper. Butter a baking dish, put in a layer of 
fish, pour over some of the sauce, grate a trifle of nutmeg on 
this, and so proceed until fish and sauce are used up. Cover 
top layer with fine bread or cracker crumbs, four gratings of 
nutmeg and bake a golden brown. Very delicious Lenten dish. 

Dried Turnips — Fill a quart measure with nice white turnips 
pared and cut into dice, boil in as little v^ater as possible until 
nearly done. A tablespoonful of sugar and a teaspoonful of salt 
in the water. When boiled as dry as possible without scorching 
stir in three spoonfuls of cream, a beaten egg and serve. 

Bean Salad — One can of stringless beans, over which a French 
dressing has been poured. Both should be thoroughly chilled 
before mixing and brought to table very cold. Mix a saltspoonful 
of salt and half that quantity of pepper with one tablespoonful of 
olive oil, then add slowly two more tablespoonfuls of oil and 
one of vinegar. Toast Saratoga flakes and serve hot with salad.

Date Pie — Soak one pound of dates over night in a little water 
and stew them in the same the next morning until soft enough 
to strain; add one quart of rich milk, three eggs, a saltspoon of 
salt and four or five gratings of nutmeg. Bake without an upper 
crust. This quantity is sufficient for three pies, so gauge accord- 
ing to your needs. Mary M. Manney.

one cupful of finely chopped cooked meat of any kind, one-half 
teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, two tablespoonfuls 
of butter, half a cupful of milk, one egg. Put the milk on to boil 
and add the meat and rice and seasoning. When this boils add 
the egg, well beaten, and stir one minute. When cool form into 
rolls, dip in beaten egg and fry in hot lard. 

Eggs a la Suisse — Spread the bottom of a flat pudding-dish 
with a tablespoonful of butter broken into bits, cover this with 
grated cheese, break five or six eggs upon the cheese, being careful 
not to break the yolks. Season slightly with salt and pepper, pour 
a little cream on the surface, strew a thick layer of grated cheese

butter and a very little salt and pepper; continue in this way until 
the dish is filled. Pour in enough milk to moisten the whole 
thoroughly and bake forty minutes. 

Tapioca Pudding — Two scant tablespoonfuls of tapioca soaked 
over night. Stir into one pint of boiling milk and cook one-half 
hour. Beat the yolks of two eggs with half a cup of sugar, add two

DINNER.

Spanish Eggs — Cook one cupful of rice thirty minutes in two 
quarts of boiling water, to which has been added one heaping 
teaspoonful of salt. Drain through a colander and add one table- 
spoonful of butter. Spread very lightly on a hot platter. On the 
rice place six dropped eggs and serve. 

Fried Sweet Potatoes — Cut sweet potatoes into slips not 
thicker than a pencil, throw them into hot lard in a frying-pan. 
They are done when they float in the lard. They will fry best 
with the lard only moderately hot. Being sweet, they are apt to 
get too dark a color if not watched. 

Southern Waffles — These are very nice and appetizing. Take 
one pint of sifted flour, add one-half teaspoonful of salt, one table- 
spoonful melted butter or lard, an egg (beaten separately), and 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 93 

mix all together in a thin batter with sweet milk. Fry brown and 
crisp in a well-greased waffle-iron. 

White Coffee— Is made with coffee that, instead of being 
browned, is only baked to a slight yellow color and is not ground, 
or at least is only bruised, and is made with one-half milk and 
one-half water. It requires twice as much coffee as the ordinary 
way, but makes a change. If the berries have been parched be- 
fore wanted, heat them over again and throw them hot into the 
boiling water. Cover and let stand to draw half an hour, then add 
the boiling milk. To prevent the milk burning while heating, 
put in a tablespoonf ul or two of sugar. A tablespoonf ul of 
whipped cream on the top of each cup is a pretty addition. 

Smelts en Marinade — Select a pound of small, fresh smelts, 
fry to a light brown in a very little salad oil of the best quality. 
When cold sprinkle them with chopped onion, two crumbled bay 
leaves, quarter-teaspoonful of pepper, half-teaspoonful of salt, 
and cover them with a cupful of cold vinegar which has been 
boiled with a clove, a pinch of sugar and shred of red pepper. Let 
them stand twenty-four hours, then add to the vinegar a spoonful 
of sweet oil and serve cold. 

Date Sandwiches — One scant cupful of sugar, one-half cupful 
of butter, one egg and one cupful of thin, sour cream; add one-half 
teaspoonful of soda and one of vanilla. Flour enough to roll very 
thin. Roll out in one long sheet. Spread with split dates and 
cover with another thin sheet of the paste. Press well together 
and cut in squares or rounds and bake in a hot oven. These may 
be made nicer by icing. Another way is to roll out light bread 
dough, butter well, spread with dates, cover and let them rise. 
Wash the tops with milk before baking. Good hot or cold. 

Stewed Steak with Oysters — Two pounds of rump steak, one 
pint of oysters, one tablespoonful of lemon juice, three of butter, 
one of flour, salt, pepper, one cupful of water. Wash the oysters 
in the water and strain into a stewpan. Put this liquor on to boil. 
As soon as it boils skim and set back. Put the butter into a 
frying-pan, and when hot put in the steak. Cook ten minutes. 
Sprinkle with a teaspoonful of salt. Take out the steak and stir 
the flour into the butter in the pan. Stir until it is a dark brown. 
Add the oyster liquor and boil one minute. Season with a pinch 
of salt and dash of pepper. Put back the steak, cover the pan and 
simmer a half-hour; then add the oysters and lemon juice and 
boil one minute. Serve on a hot dish, with points of toast for a 
garnish. 

Spaghetti and Cheese Romaine — Two cupfuls broken spag- 
hetti, one cupful minced cheese, one of milk, butter the size of 
an egg, two yolks of eggs. This dish should be quite yellow. Cook 
the spaghetti in boiling salted water twenty minutes and drain 
dry. Put the cheese, butter and half the milk into a saucepan 
and stir them over the fire until the cheese is nearly melted. Mix 
the yolks with the rest of the milk and pour that into the sauce- 
pan. Add a saltspoon of salt, same of pepper. Then add the 
whole to the spaghetti. Put it in a baking dish and bake to a

yellow brown as quickly as possible. If cooked too long it will 
become tough. 

Danish Pudding — One cupful of tapioca, three generous pints 
of cold water, half a teaspoonful salt, half a teacupful sugar, one 
tumbler of any kind of bright jelly. Wash the tapioca and soak 
it in the water all night. In the morning put on in the double 
boiler and cook one hour, stirring often. Add salt, sugar and 
jelly and mix thoroughly. Turn into a mold that has been dipped 
in cold water and set away to cool and harden. Serve with cream 
and sugar. Harriet Mann.

Roman Meat Pudding — Break up a trifle and parboil ten 
minutes in salted water half-cup of vermicelli. Drain. Mince 
fine a coffee cupful of any cold meats that are desirable, such as 
cold veal, chicken, mutton or beef (and there is nearly always 
some on hand). To this add one cup of good stock (gravy or 
cold soup is as good), nicely flavored, one egg, three tablespoon- 
fuls of tomato sauce, the half-cup of parboiled vermicelli. Mix 
all well together and season with a tablespoon each of minced 
onion and parsley, a heaping saltspoon of salt and a quarter salt- 
spoon of pepper. Have ready some macaroni boiled tender in 
salted water; it should be in three-inch lengths, about one pint. 
Line a neat greased mold with the macaroni, fill in the mince 
meat, place cover on mold, steam half an hour. Turn out of 
mold; serve with a white sauce. 

Boiled Rice — Creole — Wash a cup of rice thoroughly, chang- 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 95 

ing the water several times, for upon thorough washing depends 
its purity and snowy appearance when boiled. Place it in a 
granite saucepan containing two cuptuls of "boiling water," add 
a teaspoon of salt, and stir the rice when it begins to boil. The 
stirring must not be repeated. It must be boiled rapidly, without 
cover, until the water sinks below its surface, then cover closely 
and set the saucepan in such a position on the stove as will insure 
continued steaming for an hour and a quarter, but will not render 
the rice liable to scorch. Take off the cover when done and allow 
the rice to stand in the same position until it is quite dry, and no 
more steam escapes. Re-cover tightly and set the saucepan to 
one side to cool, for ten or fifteen minutes, then invert on a plate. 
The rice will slip out in a neat cake. Grate nutmeg over it and 
send to table. It will slice neatly. 

Turkey — Now when we can buy turkey for eight cents a 
pound let us have one for dinner. At this price it must be coarse 
and tough and must be parboiled, but if we pay a little more 
we need not parboil it. However, I prefer to cook mine this way 
and it will be as good as a younger one. A ten-pound one will 
cost eighty cents. Singe, draw carefully, and wipe well with a 
damp cloth wet with a flour and water paste. In cutting to re- 
move crop, cut the skin on the back of neck, take out the crop 
and cut the neck off as near the breast bone as possible. In this 
cavity place some dressing. Sew up the skin on the back of the 
neck and fold it over, that the breast may be plump and un- 
broken. Put the remainder of the dressing in the body, sew up 
the rent,- and truss the turkey compactly. Place in a large pot 
or boiler — a regular ham and turkey boiler is best — cover with 
boiling water and boil moderately and steadily, until nice and 
tender; when pricked with a fork the juice will escape. (It will 
have been necessary to turn it, mayhap, so it will cook evenly.) 
At this juncture remove, rub well with a heaping teaspoonful of 
salt; now lay in the roaster, which must be hot, any surplus fat 
removed from the turkey or, in the absence of this, use a good 
spoon of butter; lay upon it the turkey; and lay more butter 
on the top of it, spreading evenly; add a half -cup of boiling 
water, and brown in the oven, basting frequently; this usually 
requires one hour, or mayhap a trifle longer, and the turkey, 
dressing and sauce will be sufficient for dinner two days and 
luncheon twice, and then finally soup. 

Turkey Dressing — Take one quart of bread crumbs. Place 
in a deep dish and add a large tablespoon of butter. Rub this 
thoroughly through the crumbs and add to it one tablespoon of 
mixed herbs, rubbed fine, also a pinch of ground mace, a heaping 
teaspoon of salt and half as much pepper. Select twelve nice 
mushrooms, either fresh or canned, and twelve nicely drained 
oysters — drained well. Chop fine, mix with the bread crumbs, 
add a beaten egg to hold all together, and fill the turkey with it. 

Sauce— Stew the giblets, heart, gizard, liver, neck, and tips of 
wings, in one pint of hot water 'until tender. Chop fine, removing 
hard portions. Salt and pepper, add in small quantity; return to 



96 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

pan in which they were boiled. Chop fine six nice oysters and six 
mushrooms. When turkey is removed from roaster, stir into the 
remaining sauce two tablespoons of browned flour, when well 
cooked together, add the chopped giblets and their sauce, also the 
chopped mushrooms and oysters; add a teaspoon of lemon juice, 
boil up and serve. 

Snow Pudding — One-quarter box of gelatine, whites of three 
eggs, one cup of sugar, pint of hot water; juice of one large 
lemon; dissolve gelatine in the water; then add lemon juice and 
sugar; mix well and strain through a cloth into a mixing bowl to 
cool. Beat the whites of eggs to a stiff froth and as soon as the 
gelatine mixture begins to thicken stir in the beaten whites and 
continue to whip until it is very thick and snow white all through. 
It will take a half-hour or longer and the colder the ingredients 
the better your success. Either mold into forms, or pile in a 
pyramid and leave space around it. Keep on ice till the next day. 
This pudding will be suflicient for two meals and sometimes 
three, if family is not hearty; and should be served with a soft, 
fresh custard poured around it. 

Custard — One pint of hot milk, yolks of three eggs, pinch of 
salt, four tablespoons of sugar, little grated lemon rind. Cook in 
double boiler until of the consistency of rich cream; serve cold. 

Lebkiichen — Pour eggs, one pound of flour, beat in one direc- 
tion one-half an hour; half a pound of crushed almonds, one- 
quarter pound of sliced citron, one lemon, one orange, half an 
ounce of cinnamon, one-quarter teaspoonful of cloves, one tea- 
spoonful of allspice, half scant teaspoon of baking powder, one- 
half cup of molasses. Cream the eggs and sugar. Mix the al- 
monds and flour and add to the previous mixture; grate into it 
the peel of one lemon and the orange; stir all together, adding 
the juice of each; stir in the molasses (or honey is better), then 
add lastly the baking powder. Stir hard and well; roll out, and 
cut into small rounds and squares. Bake in moderate oven. 
When cold, spread lightly with frosting. Will keep any length 
of time and are especially good this time of year. These will 
serve five people about one dozen times.

an hour in cold water; cut up one-half pound of sausage and one- 
half pound of ham, a small piece of red pepper, one small onion, 
one large tomato (or one-half cup of canned tomatoes), and a 
sprig of parsley. Fry these in a heaping spoonful of lard, then 
add a pint of water and the rice; cover the pot and set where it 
can cook slowly one-half hour. Serve hot. Chicken, oysters or 
shrimps may be substituted for the sausage. This amount is suf- 
ficient for two meals. 

Potatoes a la Parisienne — Pare six large potatoes, cut them 
into squares, soak in cold water one-half hour; drain, and put 
into frying basket. Have a pint of fat at boiling heat, put the 
basket in the fat carefully, let cook ten minutes, drain, season 
with salt; serve very hot. 

Grapes in Sirup — Place your cans (with a few nails under 
each can, to prevent the heat from breaking them) in warm 
water, let them heat to almost boiling point; fill each can full 
of fresh grapes; fill the can with boiling v/ater and let stand 
until grapes change color; turn off the water; have a sirup 
ready; allow two coffee cupfuls of sugar to two of water; boil ten 
minutes, pour over the grapes hot, seal airtight. These will keep 
any length of time and are delicious; the juice is like wine. 

Brown Pudding— One teacupf ul of molasses, one teacupf ul suet 
chopped fine, one teacupful seeded raisins, one half teaspoonfal 
of salt, three and one-half teacupfuls flour, one teaspoonful eacn

this mixture into a cup of boiling milk and cook until it thickens. 
Mix this well with the meat and season with salt and pepper. 
Shape, dip in beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs and fry in 
boiling lard. Turkey may be used in the same manner. 

Lobster a la Newburg — Melt a large tablespoonful of butter 
and rub into it a tablespoonful of flour, a teaspoonful of salt and 
a pinch of cayenne pepper. Add one pint of milk and cook until 
it begins to thicken. Then add one can of lobster that has been 
picked into small pieces, cook a minute longer and pour over 
toast. Serve with slices of lemon. This is much better made of 
fresh lobster. 

Orange Jelly — Soak one-fourth of a box of gelatine in one- 
fourth of a cup of cold water for half an hour. Add half a cup 
of boiling water, the same quantity also of lemon juice and sugar, 
and a cup of orange juice. Stir until the gelatine is entirely dis- 
solved, strain through a cloth and set away to mold. This should 
be made immediately after breakfast and set in a cold place to 
harden. 

Puree of Potatoes — Boil and mash in two quarts of water four 
large potatoes, a small onion, two stalks of celery and a sprig 
of parsley. When done pass through a sieve, return to the flre, 
add salt and pepper to taste, and two generous tablespoonfuls of 
butter rubbed into one of flour. Boil up once and pour into a 
soup tureen over a cupful of rich milk. 

Apple Tapioca Pudding — To one-third of a cup of pearl tap- 
ioca add one pint of cold water. Place on the stove and cook

Doughnuts — One cupful of granulated sugar, one cupful of 
sweet milk, three tablespoonfuls of melted butter, two eggs, three 
cupfuls of unsifted flour, sifted with three teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder, half a teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of vanilla. Add 
flour to roll out; mix very soft. Roll one-half inch thick, cut 
in rings and fry in smoking hot lard. While warm roll in pulver- 
ized sugar. This recipe will make enough for four breakfasts. 

Minced Veal — Two cupfuls of chopped cold roast veal, a large 
saltspoonful of salt and half a saltspoonful of pepper. Moisten 
with one beaten egg and a small cupful of either stock, gravy or 
water; if the latter add one teaspoonful of melted butter. Put 
into a buttered baking dish, press down, cover and put in a steamer 
for an hour. Then spread a beaten yolk of egg on top; strew with 
fine grated bread crumbs; brown in the oven. Take out and mois- 
ten the crumbs with one teaspoonful of melted butter and one 
teaspoonful of hot water. Thin slices of lemon may be used as a 
garnish. 

Saratoga Chips — Take six medium-sized potatoes, pare and 
slice very thin on a slaw-cutter in a pan of cold water; change the 
water two or three times, squeezing the slices carefully each time 
to get all the starch out (it is the starch that toughens them); 
they should be in cold water at least one hour; ice water is 
preferable. Then spread two or three thicknesses of muslin on 
a table, take out the slices and cover with more muslin (exposure 
to the air discolors them), pat gently till the moisture is ab- 
sorbed, then fry in hot fat; when a delicate brown take out in a 
colander and sprinkle lightly with salt. Only a few slices can be 
fried at a time. 

Sweet Cucumber Pickles — Get six large cucumber pickles from 
the grocer, cut in slices half an inch thick and soak in cold water 
for an hour. Make a thick sirup of one coffeecupful of granulated 
sugar, one teacupful of vinegar; tie up one teaspoonful each of 
cinnamon and cloves in a piece of muslin; boil all to a thick sirup, 
then drain the cucumbers and add to the sirup, set them back on 
the range and simmer gently for three hours, 



100 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Sponge Cake — Two beaten eggs, one cupful of sugar; beat 
thoroughly; one-third cupful of water, one teaspoonful of either 
lemon or vanilla, then add one cupful of flour in which has been 
sifted one small teaspoonful of baking powder, stirring as little as 
possible. Bake in a square pan and cut in six squares. 

Roast Beef with Yorkshire Pudding — A nice roast of beef oc- 
casionally is economy, for after the nicest slices have done duty 
for dinner and luncheons the small pieces and scraps may be 
heated quickly in some of the brown gravy with which the roast 
was first served and which should always be saved, and you will 
have another nice meal from it. 

Yorkshire Pudding — One cupful of sweet milk, two-thirds of 
a cupful of sifted flour, a pinch of salt and three eggs, or the yolk 
of one egg may be spared to use on the top of the '''minced veal" 
in the recipe given above. Beat the eggs very light, add the salt 
and milk, then pour about half of this mixture on the flour and 
make perfectly smooth, then add the rest of the milk. Cut in 
small squares, and when the roast is about half done lay the pieces 
of dough around the meat and baste with the drippings. Cook 
about three-quarters of an hour. Serve very hot. 

Browned Potatoes — Pare five or six medium-sized potatoes, 
and about thirty minutes before the roast is done lay them on 
the bottom of the roasting pan and baste with the drippings. 

Mayonnaise Dressing for Lettuce — The yolks of two eggs, the 
juice of half a lemon, one-half teaspoonful of salt, a small pinch 
of cayenne pepper, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one-half cup- 
ful of best olive oil, one teaspoonful of dry mustard. Put the eggs 
in a china bowl, add salt, pepper and mustard, stir thoroughly 
with a fork, and drop in very slowly the oil until it thickens; then 
add the vinegar and lemon juice, stirring all the time until well 
mixed. 

Mock Cherry Pie — One cupful of cranberries; cut into each 
one with a knife (this keeps them from bursting and cooking to 
pieces), one cupful of sugar, one-half cupful of water and one 
tablespoonful of flour vv^et in a little of the water. Stir all to- 
gether and bake between two crusts. The pie should be baked 
early in the day, or before the roast is in the oven, as the steam 
and smoke will ruin pie crust. Mrs. Olive P. Abbott.

the dates moistened. 

Dates may be used in the same manner in all other porridges. 

Fricassee of Calf's Heart — Soak one calf's heart for one hour 
in cold water, wash thoroughly and remove all blood. Cut into 
pieces about one inch square, discarding all sinew and gristle. 
Throw into the kettle, just cover with boiling water, add a slice 
of onion, a bay leaf and a sprig of parsley. Simmer gently for 
one hour, or until the heart is tender. Rub a tablespoonful of 
flour and one of butter together. Stir it carefully into the stew

dash of pepper. Have ready some nicely boiled rice, arrange it 
neatly around the platter, put the fricassee in the center, sprinkle

stock, two tablespoonfuls butter, one-half cup dry bread crumbs; 
one-half pint of cream, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley,

ing water and bake in a quick oven for thirty minutes. When done 
turn from the cups on to a heated platter and pour around a 
tomato sauce.

the shell over the macaroni, stand the shell on a pie dish and 



102 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

bake in a moderate oven twenty minutes. Serve on a napkin, 
helping the macaroni from the shell. 

Rice Jelly — Cover a quarter of a box of gelatine with a quar- 
ter of a cup of cold water and let it soak half an hour. Boil four 
tablespoonfuls of rice in a large kettle of rapidly boiling water 
for thirty minutes. Allow the rice to boil rapidly so that the 
grains will not stick together; drain and turn the rice carefully 
on a towel, spread it out and roll the towel from side to side 
until the rice is free from moisture. Whip one pint of cream, 
put it in a basin, place basin in a pan of cracked ice; add two- 
thirds of a cup of powdered sugar and a teaspoonful of vanilla. 
Add carefully the rice. Stand the gelatine over the teakettle until 
dissolved; strain it slowly into the cream and stir constantly, but 
carefully, until the whole is partly congealed. Turn into molds 
that have been wet with cold water and stand aside to harden. 
Take one-half tumbler of jelly, currant or crab apple, add to it 
a gill of water, and stir over the fire until thoroughly melted; 
cool. When the pudding is ready to serve turn from the mold, 
pour over this sauce and serve.

spoons of baking powder into it; rub in one tablespoon of lard; 
and one teaspoon of salt and one wellrbeaten egg. Moisten with 
just enough sweet milk to make into dough, not too stiff; roll out 
and bake on greased griddle; when it is cooked on one side turn it 
over and let it cook till a pale brown on the other side; then split 
it open, butter it and put together again; cut it into three-cornered 
pieces and serve it hot. 

Steamed Indian Bread — Three cupfuls of buttermilk, two cup- 
fuls of sweet milk, three cupfuls of cornmeal, two cupfuls of flour, 
one teaspoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of soda, beat thoroughly; 
put in a greased pan and steam three hours. 

Dresden Patties — The patty cases are to be made of bread; so 
cut some slices of bread two inches thick; stamp them out with a 
round cutter; take out the inside not quite through, leaving a 
bottom to each case; cut a little lid to each case, dip these in milk, 
let them dry a little; then egg and breadcrumb cases and lids 
and fry a light brown in boiling fat. Make a sauce of one ounce 
of flour, one and one-half ounces of butter, one-half pint of stock 
or water; season with six drops of lemon juice, just a dash of pep- 
per; chop fine four ounces of veal and four ounces of ham; stir 
it into the sauce over the fire till quite hot; fill each patty case 
with this hot mixture and place a lid on top of each. Serve on a 
napkin. 

This is a very good way of using up odd scraps of meat. 

Rice and Tomato Soup — Strain and press through a sieve with 
a wooden spoon one-half of a three-pound can of tomatoes; stir 
into them two quarts of clear stock that has been made from 
bones; season with a teaspoonful of salt and a quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of pepper; add four ounces rice that has been well 
v/ashed in plenty of cold water and boil the soup slowly for three- 
quarters of an hour.

bacon, one small carrot, juice of one-half a lemon, one small onion, 
bouquet garni, parsle3^ two ounces of butter, one tablespoonful of 
Harvey sauce, one ounce of flour, one pint of stock. Wash the 
tripe in cold water and then blanch it — that is, put it on in cold 
water and let it come to a boil — take it out of the stewpan, throw 
the water away, dry it with a clean cloth and cut it into strips 
two inches wide and four inches long. Cut the bacon into very 
thin slices the same size as the strips of tripe. Chop up the 
parsley fine, lay the strips of bacon on the tripe, sprinkle a little 
parsley on each, roll them up together and tie round with string. 
Cut up the onion and carrot and put them with the bouquet garni 
into a stewpan with the rolls of tripe and one pint of stock, and let 
all simmer for two hours, then take out the rolls of tripe. Mix 
two ounces of butter and one ounce of fiour together in a stewpan, 
strain the stock into it, stir till it thickens, add the lemon juice 
and Harvey sauce, also the rolls of tripe, long enough to get hot 
through. Arrange the tripe in a circle around mashed potatoes 
and pour the 'sauce around,

two ounces of butter, two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, salt and 
whole pepper to taste, one onion, a bunch of savory herbs, four 
cloves, one blade of mace, into a stew-pan; lay in the feet, and 
pour in just sufficient water to cover the whole. Stew gently 
for about three hours; take out the feet, dish them and cover 
with parsley and butter. The liquor they were boiled in should 
be strained and put by in a clean basin for use; it will be found 
very good as an addition to gravies, etc. 

Stewed Squirrels — Three fine gray squirrels, skinned and 
cleaned; joint as you would chickens for fricassee; half-pound of 
fat salt pork, one onion (if liked) sliced, half-can of corn, half-

very small pinch of salt; have ready on the fire a pint of milk 
sweetened and flavored with vanilla; as soon as it boils drop the 
beaten eggs into it by tablespoonfuls, and as soon as they become 
set dip them out with a tin; slice and arrange them according 
to fancy upon a broad dish; allow the milk to cool a little, and

Creamed Salt Mackerel — Soak the fish all night and wipe dry 
before using. Broil on a butter gridiron over a clear fire. Lay 
on a hot dish and pour over it a cream sauce made as follows: 
Into one cup of boiling milk stir tv/o teaspoonfuls of cornstarch, 
rubbed smooth with one tablespoonful of butter; cook until well 
thickened; add a well-beaten egg, mixing carefully to prevent 
curdling; cook a moment longer, season with a teaspoonful of 
chopped parsley and a saitspoonful of pepper. 

Mush Croquettes — Make one pint of cornmeal mush with yel- 
low meal and boiling water; while the mush is hot stir in one 
tablespoonful of butter, then set away to cool. When lukewarm 
add two well-beaten eggs and one saitspoonful of salt. Form into 
croquettes three inches long, fry in smoking hot fat till a golden 
brown, lay on soft paper to absorb superfluous grease, and serve 
hot. 

Hominy Muffins — Mash fine with a fork one cup of cold hom- 
iny left from yesterday's breakfast, add one cup of cornmeal, one 
saltspoon of salt, two teaspoonfuls of sugar, one teaspoonful of 
baking pow^der, two teaspoonfuls melted butter, one egg and half 
a cup of milk. Beat hard for three minutes, pour into buttered 
gem-pans and bake in hot oven for fifteen minutes. 

Puree of Beans — A cupful of cold baked beans left from the 
Saturday's dinner furnishes the foundation for this m^ost excel- 
lent soup. The beans having been already well seasoned and thor- 
oughly cooked the soup is very easily and quickly made. Place 
two tablespoonfuls each of butter and flour in a saucepan over 
the fire, stir them until they are brov/n, then add one cup of baked 
beans and three pints of boiling water, season with a few stalks 
of celery cut in inch pieces, a half teaspoonful of salt and quar- 
ter of a teaspoonful of pepper. Boil until the beans are soft, 
then pass through a colander, rubbing the beans through with a 
potato masher, if you have no "puree sieve." Return the soup to 
the fire and allow it to boil up once. Serve with half-inch dice 
of bread fried in enough hot butter to brov/n them. If dice of 
toasted bread are used they soften directly, whereas the fried 
bread remains crisp.

Boiled Beesteak Pudding— Cut one pound and a half of round 
Rteak into inch pieces, rejecting all gristle and skin, but using a 
little of the fat. Season with one teaspoonful of salt and half a 
teaspoonful of pepper. For the crust take a cup of beef suet 
chopped fine, a scant two cups of flour with a small half-teaspoon- 
ful of salt; mix all together in a bowl, make a hole in the center, 
pour in a half cup of cold water, quickly and lightly make into 
a dough with a knife, turn out on a floured pastry-board and roll 
into a crust a half-inch thick. Grease a quart bowl, lay in the 
crust, pressing it gently all around; into this put the meat, and 
when the bov/1 is full pour in a half cup of cold water. Gather 
up the overlapping paste and pinch it together to form a cover. 
Place a floured cloth over the pudding, pass a string twice around 
the flaring part of the bowl and tie securely; then bring the four 
ends of the cloth over the top and tie in a knot, so that the pud- 
aing may be lifted as though it were a basket or bundle. Place 
in a kettle of boiling water and boil steadily for three hours. 

Potato Souffle — Boil four good-sized potatoes and rub them 
through a sieve. Take one cupful of milk and two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter. Let them come to a boil. Add the potatoes, a half 
teaspoonful of salt, a third of a teaspoonful of white pepper and 
beat to a cream. Then add, one at a time, the yolks of three eggs, 
beating steadily. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, 
add them to the mixture, stirring lightly, and pour into a well- 
buttered dish. Bake twenty minutes in a moderate oven.

deep dish with the yolks and season with a large half-teaspoonful 
of salt, half a saltspoonful of pepper, and a little chopped parsley. 
Next put in the chopped oysters, beating vigorously, as you add 
them gradually. ¥/hen they are thoroughly mixed, add a table- 
spoonful of melted butter, finally whip in the whites lightly, and 
put the mixture in the pan. Do not stir it, but when it begins to 
set, slip a broad-bladed knife around the sides and under the 
omelet, that the butter may reach everj'- part. As soon as the 
center is fairly "set" turn upside-down into a hot dish. 

Barbecued Ham — Lay slices of underdone ham in a frying- 
pan, pepper each slice and lay upon it a quarter of a teaspoonful 
of made mustard. Pour about them some vinegar, allowing half 
a teaspoonful to each slice. Fry quickly and turn often. When

the pan the juice of half a lemon and a teaspoonful of white 
sugar. 

Queen Potato Puffs — Sift together five dessertspoonfuls flour, 
half a teaspoonful of baking powder and a saltspoonful of salt. 
Grate into this three large cold boiled potatoes; add half a cup 
of milk, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley and two v/ell- 
beaten eggs. Place over the nre a spider containing melted lard; 
when smoking hot, drop the mixture into it by the dessertspoon- 
ful and fry to a light brown. Drain the puffs on brown paper 
'and serve very hot. 

Veal Olives with Oysters — Cut large, smooth slices from a 
fillet of veal, spread each neatly with a force-meat made of 
half a cup of bread crumbs and a quarter cup of chopped pork, 
seasoned with a saltspoonful of salt and quarter saltspoonful of 
pepper, moistened with a little hot water or milk. Over the 
force-meat spread some chopped oysters (about three to each 
good-sized olive). Roll them up carefully and closely and bind 
with pack-thread. Lay them in a dripping-pan, dash a teacup- 
ful of boiling water over them and roast, basting at least twice 
with melted butter. When they are brown, remove to a hot dish 
and cover while you add a little oyster-liquor, a pinch of salt and 
a dash of pepper to the gravy in the dripping-pan. Let this sim- 
mer for three or four minutes, thicken with a teaspoonful of 
browned fiour and boil up once; cut the pack-thread, pour the 
gravy over them and serve. 

Carrot Salad — Boil three carrots in plenty of water; when half 
done, remove and throw out water and finish cooking in fresh 
boiling T\^ater. When done, take out, cool, and cut in half-inch 
dice. Make a dressing of half a small teacup of vinegar, three 
tablespoonfuls of butter, the yolk of a hard-boiled egg, a salt- 
spoonful of salt and half a saltspoonful of pepper. Line a dish 
with lettuce leaves, add two-thirds of the dressing, then the 
carrot dice, then the remainder of the dressing.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 113 

Junket — To one quart of milk slightly warmed, placed in a 
dish for the table, add one tablespoonful of liquid rennet, stirring 
only enough to mix it thoroughly. To be eaten very cold with

Croutons — Butter four thick slices of bread on both sides. 
Cut into cubes and brown crisp in the oven in a dripping pan, 
shaking about occasionally. 

Baked Pike — Carefully prepare a three or four pound pike, 
whitefish or salmon trout. Score the upper side diagonally four 
or five times; lay a slice of pork in each incision. Dredge with 
flour, salt and pepper. Place in baking pan with a little hot water.

ful of sugar, juice and rind of ona lemon, one cupful of hot water, 
two tablespoonfuls of flour, stirred with one egg well beaten. 
Mix and cook till thick like cream. Use cold. This cake can be 
used for two or three desserts. Long Branch crackers are also 
good with the snow pudding if the cake is omitted.

Fried Salmon Trout Cutlets — Cut six cutlets from larg© sal- 
mon trout, roll in bread crumbs, season with salt and pepper and 
fry in hot fat. Dish on hot platter and cover with cream sauce. 

Macedoine Salad — One cupful of cold boiled potatoes sliced, 
half a cup of celery stalks cut in pieces, a few cold string beans 
(if you have them), one or two slices of onion and a little raw 
cabbage cut fine. Line the salad bowl with lettuce leaves, heap 
vegetable mixture on these and cover with French dressing. This 
is a good way to use up any cold vegetable, as nearly any kind 
may be added to the salad. 

Spiced Apples — Pare and cut in quarters six small tart apples 
and put in saucepan with one cup white sugar and three cloves. 
Boil gently till fruit is transparent. Serve cold. This is im- 
proved by the addition of one stick of cinnamon and a blade of 
mace. 

Puree of Split Peas — One cup split peas soaked over night 
in cold water. Put on to boil with half a spoon of soda, let boil 
ten minutes, drain, blanch and drain again. Put back on stove 
with one quart of water and a little ham or mutton. Boil two 
hours, press through colander, return to fire, add a tablespoon 
butter and tablespoon flour rubbed together, boil two or three 
minutes, add one-half teaspoon salt and a little pepper and serve. 

Lamb Chops with Mushrooms — Fry six thick loin chops for 
five minutes in hot fat, turning to brown both sides, then add 
one cup water or stock, the juice from one can of mushrooms 
and the mushrooms sliced. Boil fifteen minutes, add about one- 
half teaspoonful of salt, a quarter saltspoonful of pepper, and 
half a teaspoonful curry and pour in deep platter inside a wall 
of boiled rice. 

Strawberry Shortcakes — Make rich sponge cake and bake 
in shallow pan. When cold cut out five large round pieces, split 
open, spread with canned strawberries; put whole berries on 
the top and serve with whipped cream colored with strawberry 
juice. Mrs. B. A. Tyler.

A YELLOW AND WHITE MENU. 



Cream Fritters — Stir the whites of five eggs, one cup of thin 
cream, two full cups of flour and one-quarter teaspoonful of salt 
together and beat hard for three minutes. Fry in plenty of hot 
lard, using a tablespoonful of batter for each fritter. 

Cheese Omelet — Beat thoroughly the yolks of five eggs, add 
five tablespoonfuls of milk, one small half teaspoonful of salt, 
one-eighth teaspoonful of pepper. Then beat the whites very stiff 
and gently stir them into the yolks. Butter a large spider and 
heat it, then pour the mixture in, cover tightly and cook slowly 
until brown on the bottom; set in the oven a minute to dry the 
top, then sprinkle one-half cup of fresh cheese on it. Fold to- 
gether and serve at once. 

English Lunch Bread — Take one quart of warm milk, one 
tablespoonful lard, two beaten eggs, one-half cake compressed 
yeast, one-half teaspoonful salt and mix in flour enough to make 
a dough. Knead well and let rise over night. The next morning 
handle only sufiiciently to form into loaves and bake in shallow 
bread pans. 

White Fricassee of Chicken — Cut up pair of small chickens, 
put on to stew with half pound salt pork cut in strips and enough 
cold water to cover well and simmer until tender, allowing all 
the water to boil away. Put one large tablespoonful butter in 
frying-pan and when melted add two tablespoonfuls of flour; mix 
well but do not brown; add one pint milk and stir until it boils; 
add one-half teaspoonful salt and one-quarter teaspoonful pepper 
and pour it over the chicken, previously dished. Sprinkle with 
one tablespoonful of chopped parsley. 

Lemon Custard Pie — Beat the yolks of three eggs and one- 
half pound of powdered sugar to a cream, then add the unbeaten 
whites of two eggs and beat the whole until very light. Add the 
juice and rind of three lemons and one tablespoonful of butter; 
now stand the bowl in a basin of boiling water over the fire and 
stir until the mixture thickens; set away to cool. Line a pie-dish 
with good paste and bake, then pour in the lemon mixture. Beat 
the remaining white of egg with three tablespoonfuls powdered 
sugar, put this meringue over the top of the pie and set in the 
oven until a golden brown. Mrs. E. C. Janiison, 

296 East 60th Street, Chicago.

Broiled Salt Mackerel — Freshen by soaking the fish over 
night, taking care that the skin lies uppermost; in the morning 
dry without breaking; lay it between the bars of a buttered fisli 
gridiron and broil to a light brown; lay 'upon a hot dish; meit 
a tablespoonful of butter, add to it a teaspoonful lemon juice or 
vinegar, a tablespoonful hot water, a pinch black pepper, a very 
small cucumber pickle chopped fine and pour over the mackerel. 

Minced Potatoes and Corn (left overs) — Chop fine cold boiled 
potatoes and mix with them cooked canned corn in proportion 
of one cup potato to a half cup corn; if left over they are probably 
seasoned sufficiently; put three large tablespoonfuls good drip- 
ping into a frying-pan, and when hot stir in potatoes and corn, 
tossing them round with a fork until thoroughly heated; taste 
and add if necessary more pepper and salt; serve in a covered 
dish. 

Breakfast Biscuit — Sift together one scant quart flour, two 
heaping teaspoonfuls baking powder, a half teaspoonful salt; mix 
a half teacup melted butter in rather less than a quart of sweet 
milk; add to the flour, beating well, until the batter is stiff 
enough to drop from a spoon into a buttered tin, like drop cakes; 
the oven should be very hot or the biscuits will not be light and 
puffy. 

Baked Hash — Chop fine any sort of cold meat — corned beef 
is excellent. To each pint of meat add one pint and a half of cold 
boiled potatoes chopped fine, one tablespoonful of butter and one 
cupful of gravy or stock; if no stock is to be had use a little 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 117 

more butter and two-thirds of a cupful of hot water. If the meat 
and potatoes have been seasoned before, they will need but little; 
if not, a good rule is a half-teaspoonful of salt and a quarter- 
teaspoonfui of pepper. Put a scant tablespoonful of butter in the 
skillet, and when it melts turn in the mixture, spreading smoothly. 
Cover the pan and set back where it will not burn. Let it brown 
slowly — it will take about half an hour. When done fold to- 
gether like an omelet and lay on a hot dish. Triangles of buttered 
toast are nice with this hash. 

Hot Tea Cakes — Beat together one-half pint sugar and one 
teaspoonful of butter; beat two eggs very light, add them to 
butter and sugar; a pinch of salt, one-third saltspoonful of nut- 
meg and one-half pint of milk; now beat in one scant pint of 
flour, sifted with three level teaspoonfuls of baking powder. But- 
ter two shallow cake-tins and spread about two-thirds full. Bake 
twenty minutes in a moderately hot oven. To be eaten hot, with 
butter and raspberry jam. 

Salmon Soup — Take about half a can salmon, remove bones 
and skin and put it on to cook, together with a sliced onion and a 
quart of seasoned stock; or, failing stock, water. Let it boil slowly 
for fifteen or twenty minutes, then rub through a soup strainer. 
Have a quart of milk heated to boiling; thicken this with a large 
tablespoonful butter and a scant tablespoonful flour; add this to 
the strained salmon; one-half teaspoonful of salt and quarter- 
teaspoonful of pepper; let it heat, after adding the salmon, but 
not long or it may loose its smooth, creamy appearance. Many 
persons like a stalk of celery boiled with the salmon. 

The salmon left after taking out half a can for soup can be 
used delightfully. Put in a china dish until needed, then remove 
bones and skin, chop fine, add fine mashed potato — twice as 
much potato as salmon — a large tablespoonful butter, a half-cup 
of cream, a well-beaten egg or two; season to taste and bake like 
a soufile in a buttered pan. 

Veal Potpie — Put a small plate into the pot to keep the veal 
from burning. Cut into small pieces two pounds of veal, and put 
into the pot with two quarts of water — hot or cold. Keep boiling 
gently for an hour and a half. When it begins to grow tender 
put in a full teaspoonful salt and a bit of red pepper pod, or two 
or three pepper corns. If onion or potato is liked cut in pieces 
and add when the stew is half done. Add a half cup of cream or 
rich milk before removing from the fire, a heaping tablespoonful 
butter and a tablespoonful flour. Make a quart of flour into bak- 
ing-powder biscuits, cut in squares and bake quickly. When the 
veal is ready and the biscuits are baked split the biscuits, put them 
on a hot platter, see that the gravy is thickened and seasoned, 
and pour over the biscuits, disposing the veal over them so that 
they can be served together. This is much more healthful than 
the boiled dough. 

Princess Potatoes — Slice cold mashed potatoes into strips two 
inches long, one inch wide, one-half inch thick. Have in one 
saucer a tablespoonful melted butter, in another a beaten egg. 



118 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Dip the strips first in the butter, then in the egg. With a knife 
lay them on a buttered tin, and cook in a hot oven for twelve 
minutes. 

Cream Cabbage — Cut the cabbage into quarters, or small bits 
as preferred, cook in salted water until tender, draining off the 
first water. When tender pour in a cup milk or cream, add a 
scant tablespoonful of butter, a half teaspoonful of salt, a little 
pepper and a teaspoonful flour to thicken. 

Parsnip Balls — Mash one pint of boiled parsnips. Add two 
tablespoonfuls butter, one-half teaspoonful salt, a little pepper, 
two tablespoonfuls cream; mix together and stir on the fire until 
the mixture bubbles. Remove from the fire, and before it cools 
add one well-beaten egg. When cold make into bails about half 
the size of an egg. Dip into beaten egg, then into bread crumbs. 
Use the frying basket for these balls and fry a pale brown in boil- 
ing lard. 

Peach Cottage Pudding — Stir to a cream one-half cup butter, 
one cup sugar; add a cup rich milk, two well-beaten eggs and a 
pint of flour sifted with two teaspoonfuls baking powder and a 
pinch of salt. Into this batter stir canned peaches sliced very 
thin. One's own taste must decide how many peaches. Butter 
a long, oval mold; bake the cake in this thirty minutes in a mod- 
erate oven. 

Hard Sauce — Beat one cup sugar and one-half cup butter to a 
white cream; add the whites of two eggs, beat a few minutes 
longer. A tablespoonful fruit juice or a teaspoonful vanilla 
or lemon will flavor it. Extract of nutmeg is nice or a teaspoon- 
ful of lemon juice. Miss Anne Everett George.

it should be immediately dished on buttered toast. Add a salt- 
spoonful of salt and dash of pepper. 

Honey Muffins — Sift together one and one-half pints of flour, 
two tablespoonfuls baking powder and a small half teaspoonful 
of salt. Work in two tablespoonfuls of butter; beat and add three 
eggs, one teacupful of honey and half a pint of milk. Bake in a 
hot oven. 

Beef Loaf with Tomato — One pound of rare beef chopped fine, 
three large crackers rolled and sifted; add one-half teaspoonful 
of salt and one-eighth teaspoonful of pepper, with one well- 
beaten egg. Work all until thoroughly mixed. Press it into a 
bowl and turn out into a buttered tin. Rub a little butter over 
it and pour on a large cup of canned tomato. Bake three-quarters 
of an hour, basting frequently with the tomato. Serve hot.

Broiled Sheep's Kidneys — Sheep's kidneys are best for broil- 
ing. Procure them, if you can, with the suet still upon them. 
Slice them through the fat, then pare off enough of it just to 
leave a border around each slice. Pepper and salt them and 
broil them over clear coals. They should be fairly done through 
and no more, and should be turned over but once that the gravy 



120 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

may collect on top. Dish them on bread, thin sliced, and drop a 
bit of butter on the top of each slice. 

Toasted Potatoes — Pare the largest potatoes and cut them in 
slices an eighth of an inch thick. Touch them with the butter 
brush and broil them over clear coals at a good height above the 
fire. Dip in butter and sprinkle with fine salt when done. Serve 
with the kidneys in a separate dish or under them in place of 
the bread. 

English Muffins — These may be bought at the baker's. Split 
them and toast a golden brown; butter well, pile one upon an- 
other and send to the table very hot. 

Whitpot — Two quarts of sweet milk, four eggs, one-half pint 
of cornmeal, one-half pint of molasses, one tablespoonful of cin- 
namon and cloves, mixed. Have the milk boiling, then put ail 
the other ingredients together, mix well and stir into the milk 
and cook slowly until it separates. Serve in soup bowls or plates. 
This dish is a favorite one with the children and has been handed 
down from old colonial times. 

Boiled Salmon Steak — Boil a pint of broth or water with a 
small piece of celery and half a handful of parsley, half salt- 
spoon of pepper and half teaspoon of salt to season, and a table- 
spoonful of vinegar. Cut the steaks in suitable pieces and put the 
fragments and bones in the boiling liquor. Place the salmon in a 
bright saucepan, strain the seasoned broth over "it and cook by 
brisk boiling with a lid on top, eight or ten minutes. Serve in a 
deep dish or tureen with the liquor instead of a sauce. To be 
eaten with bread and butter. I'he merit of this dish is in the full 
preservation of the flavor and richness of the fish. 

Hollandaise Potatoes — The potatoes should be cut all into 
one neat shape before cooking. This can be done with an apple 
corer if one has no potato scoop. The rest of the potato can be 
used at another meal. Set the potatoes on the range in cold water 
with a little salt in it. Boil very gently about twenty minutes, 
taking care that they do not break and boil away, then pour off 
the water and let them cool and dry a little. When to be served 
pour over them a cupful of Hollandaise sauce and sprinkle a little 
chopped parsley over the top. 

Hollandaise Sauce — This should be a golden yellow, shining 
and smooth and just thick enough to be taken up on the point of 
a knife. Boil one-half cupful of broth, milk or water with a 
dozen pepper corns, a scrap of broken nutmeg and a level tea- 
spoonful of salt. V/hen flavored strain it into another saucepan. 
Put in two-thirds of a cupful of butter and the yolks of four eggs 
and beat it with a fork over the fire until it thickens like cream. 
Then take it off and beat in the rest of the cupful of butter in 
little bits, still beating until all is melted. Then squeeze in the 
juice of a lemon or a tablespoonful of vinegar instead. 

Macaroni Bechamel — Five ounces macaroni, two ounces 
cheese, two ounces butter, one and one-half pints milk or water, 
two eggs. Boil the macaroni by itself first, throwing it into water 
that is already boiling and salted. Cook only twenty minutes 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 121 

and drain dry. Put it in a baking dish. Chop the cheese, not very- 
fine, and mix it with the macaroni and butter. Beat the two 
eggs and pint of water or milk together, pour them over the 
macaroni and set it in the oven to bake. While it is getting hot 
boil the remaining half-pint of water or milk and thicken it with 
a rounded tabiespoonful of flour; add salt and a tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley, and when the macaroni in the oven is set so 
that the two cannot mix pour this white-cream sauce on the top 
of it, shut up the oven and let it bake a yellow-brown. This makes 
a very attractive dish, the yellow cheese and custard boiling up in 
spots among the v/hite sauce and parsley. 

Dainty Little Puddings — Grate two large cupfuls of stale bread 
and soften it with a cupful of water. Grate the rind and squeeze 
the juice from one orange. Cut tvv'o ounces of citron into small 
bits and mix with the bread, together with the yolks of two eggs 
and sugar enough to sweeten the whole. Butter five or six small 
cups. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, and just before 
putting the puddings in the oven mix them v/ith the bread and 
fruit. Distribute the mixture evenly in the cups and bake slovfly 
about twenty minutes, or until they are brown. Serve hot. 

Cream Sauce — Boil one cupful of milk or thin cream with a 
broken nutmeg or a piece of stick cinnamon in it. Mix together 
three tablespoonfuls of sugar and one large teaspoonful of corn- 
starch dry: stir this into the boiling milk and remove from the 
range when it thickens. Beat in a large teaspoonful of butter 
and strain. Harriet Mann.

oysters (one pint), boil and skim the liquor. Put one tablespoon- 
ful flour and one teaspoonful of curry powder, a saltspoonful salt 
in the butter; mix; add the oyster liquor, which should measure 
a half-pint; if it does not, add sufficient water to make up the 
quantity. Stir until boiling. Have a very hot griddle, throw the 
oysters on a few at a time. When brown on one side turn and 
brown on the other, ana then Ijft at once and put them in the 
sauce. Serve hot in a border of plain boiled rice. 

Stuffed Prunes — Wash one pound of prunes, cover with cold 
water and soak over night. Next morning drain, saving the water. 
Remove the stones from the prunes without spoiling the shape of 
the fruit. Put an almond in each place from which a stone was 
taken. The almonds must be blanched and slightly roasted. Add 
to the water a teaspoonful of vanilla and a half-cup of sugar. 
Bring to a boil and skim. Boil two minutes. Add prunes; when 
soft lift carefully and put aside to cool. A tablespoonful of soaked 
gelatine may be added while the prunes are hot. This will give 
a creamy, clear sauce. 

Mock Bisque Soup — Put one pint of tomatoes on to stew, with 
one bay leaf, sprig of parsley and blade of mace, let them stew 
fifteen minutes. Put one quart of milk on to boil in a farina 
boiler. Rub together one large tablespoonful of butter, two table- 
spoonfuls of flour; add to the milk when boiling and stir con- 
stantly until it thickens. Now press the tomatoes through a 
sieve, and add a teaspoonful of sugar and half a teaspoonful of 
scda, a teaspoonful of salt and the boiling water. Serve immedi- 
ately. 

Sauce Bernaise — Beat the yolks of three eggs until creamy; 
add three tablespoonfuls of hot water, three tablespoonfuls of 
olive oil; stand the bowl in a pan of boiling water and stir until 
the eggs thicken; take from the fire and add one tablespoonful of 
vinegar, a dash dt pepper and a little salt. Mix well and stand 
away to cool. 

Orange Charlotte — Cover one-third of a box of gelatine with 
one-third of a cup of cold water and soak a half-hour; add to it a 
third of a cup of boiling water, juice of one lemon, one cup of 
sugar, one cup of orange juice and a little of the grated rind; whip 
to a foam one pint of cream and add it to the above mixture; beat 
until it thickens and then turn it into a pudding mold lined with 
sections of oranges. Elizabeth Howell.

an egg, pour in the mixture and let it cook over a clear fire; as 
soon as it is cooked through fold over on to a hot dish and serve 
quickly. 

Rice Cutlets — One-fourth pound of rice, one-half pound of 
cold meat, one onion, one-fourth pound of bread crumbs; boil the 
rice and strain it, chop up the meat and onions small and mix 
with the rice; sprinkle one saltspoonful of salt and one-fourth

in salted water for fifteen minutes; drain them and serve with the 
following sauce: Mix one and one-half ounces of butter with one 
taljlespoon of flour, add one-half pint of water, one-fourth tea- 
spoon of salt and just a dash of pepper; stir over the fire until 
it thickens, then take the pan off the fire and stir in the yoiks of 
two eggs, beaten up with a teaspoonful of lemon juice and 
strained. 

Artichokes make a delicious dish cooked this way and may 
be eaten with meat or fish, or served as a separate course with 
toast. Jerusalem artichokes come into the market in July; they 
may be packed in sand for winter use. 

Caramel Pudding — For the caramel, two ounces of white 
sugar, one-half gill of cold water; put two ounces of white sugar 
and one-half gill of cold water into a stewpan and boil quickly 
until coffee-color; stir well and pour it quickly into a thoroughly 
dry plain mold and let it coat the mold all over. Make a custard 
of four yolks and one white of egg, one tablespoon of white sugar 
and one-half pint of milk, thus: Break the eggs into a basin, add 
the sugar; boil the milk, and when a little cool pour it on to the 
eggs and sugar; then strain it into the mold you have lined with 
earn m el; put a buttered paper over the top and steam it slowly 
for half an hour; turn it out on to a dish and some of the caramel 
will run off and form a sauce (this is a delicious pudding).

Prunes — Soak prunes over night and boil slowly from five to 
six hours. Sweeten just before removing from stove. 

Rolled Avena — Have boiling water in lower part of double 
boiler. Put one quart boiling water in upper part. Add one tea- 
spoonful salt. Stir in quickly one pint of rolled avena. Keep 
boiling rapidly for twenty-five minutes. Do not stir at all while 
cooking. Remove cooker to stove shelf or top of reservoir, where 
it will keep hot with no danger of boiling. Allow it to remain 
there from half an hour to an hour. This process causes the 
grains to swell v/ithout bursting, and the result is a deliciously 
light dish of oatmeal. 

Yeast-Raised Muffins — One pint of milk, one large kitchen 
spoonful butter, melted; one cake compressed yeast, one-half 
teaspoonful salt, flour to make a thick batter. Mix these ingre- 
dients at supper time. Cover well and leave in warm place. In 
the morning add the beaten white of one egg and a pinch of soda 
the size of a pea, or more if needed to make batter perfectly 
sweet. Fry in greased muffin rings on a hot greased griddle. 

Chile Sauce — To be made in the summer. One-half peck toma- 
toes, chopped; three stalks of celery, cut fine; one cup grated 
horseradish; two red peppers, chopped fine; one cup of onions, 
chopped fine; one small cup of salt, one cup of black and white 
mustard seed, two tablespoonfuls of white pepper seed, two tea- 
spoonfuls of cinnamon, one teaspoonful of cloves, one teaspoonful 
of mace, one cup white sugar, one quart cider vinegar. Stir all 
well together. Do not cook. Keep in Mason jars. 

Crullers — Two cups brown sugar, one and one-half cups but- 
ter, six eggs, one-half nutmeg, flour enough to make a moderately 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 131 

stiff dough. Roll to a thickness of a quarter of an inch, cut out 
and fry in smoking hot lard. 

Argentine Soup— Soak one-half pint split peas for two hours. 
Boil in plenty of water for four hours with two bay leaves and 
twelve seeds of dried red pepper. An hour before serving add one 
quart of good strong stock or three-quarters of a pint of cold 
roast meat gravy. One-half hour before serving add one pint of 
canned tomatoes. Allow soup to boil down to three quarts. Strain 
through colander. Season with salt to suit taste. Two teaspoon- 
fuls will be found nearly correct. Allow soup to boil again before 
serving. This soup may be varied indefinitely by using different 
fresh and dried vegetables. 

Steamed Batter Pudding — Beat one egg, add one-half teacup 
sugar and lump of butter size of walnut. Sift one teaspoon baking 
powder and one-half teaspoon salt into two cups of flour. Stir 
a cup of raisins into the flour. Stir all together, adding gradually 
two-thirds of a cup of sweet milk. Turn into buttered pudding 
dish. Steam one hour. Cover steamer with cloth before cover- 
ing with lid, as this closes it more surely. Serve pudding with 
cream and sugar. Mrs. Milton Updegraff.

yeast, one teaspoonful of salt, flour enough to make a stiff batter. 



132 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

When light add half a cupful of melted butter, a teaspoonful of 
soda dissolved in a little water, and a very little more flour. Let 
it stand twenty minutes, or until light. Grease some muffin rings, 
place them on a hot griddle and fill them half full of butter. 
When done on one side turn and bake on the other. Butter them 
while hot, pile one on another and serve immediately. 

Mayonnaise Fish — Take a pound or more of cold boiled fish, 
cut into pieces an inch in length. Put the yolks of four fresh raw 
eggs with two hard-boiled ones into a cold bowl. Rub them as 
smooth as possible before introducing the oil. Allow a tablespoon- 
f ul of oil to each yolk of raw egg. Introduce this by degrees, a few 
drops at a time. When the oil is well mixed and resembles jelly 
put in one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper and 
one of made mustard. Add two tablespoonfuls of vinegar gradual- 
ly. Serve the fish in a glass dish, with half the dressing stirred 
in with it. Spread the remainder over the top and lay lettuce 
leaves around the edges. 

Pulled Chicken — Cut off the first and second joints, sides and 
back from a cold roasted chicken, dip them in beaten egg and 
bread crumbs seasoned with salt and pepper. Skin the breast 
and wings and pull the meat off in fiakes; heat in a nicely sea- 
soned white sauce. Broil the breaded pieces. Pour the mince 
in the middle of a dish, lay the rest around, and the juice of 
half a lemon may be squeezed over all. 

White Sauce — Mix two tablespoonfuls of sifted flour with two 
of warm butter. Place over the fire a saucepan containing a pint 
of sweet milk and half teaspoon of salt and a dash of white pepper. 
When it reaches the boiling point add the butter and flour, stir- 
ring briskly until it thickens. Cook flve minutes. 

Orange Float — One quart of water, the juice and pulp of two 
lemons, one coffeecupful of sugar. When boiling hot add four 
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch. Boil fifteen minutes, stirring all 
the time. When cold pour it over five sliced oranges in a glass 
dish. Over the top spread the beaten whites of three eggs sweet- 
ened and flavored with vanilla. Mrs. John Buie.

DINNER. 

Chicken broth with rice. 

Broiled whitefish and hard-boiled eggs. 

Browned potatoes. 

Orange salad and toasted crackers. 

Jenny Linde — lemon sauce. 

Coffee. 



White Cornmeal Mush — The art of making perfectly smooth 
mush is to have the water boiling and salted. Into a quart of 
such water let white meal fall from the left hand, stirring 
steadily with the right hand until the meal floats in little dry 
patches on top; then boil for fifteen minutes, stirring constantly. 
Serve with cream. 

Minute Ginger Cake — Set a teacup in a cake bowl and put 
into the cup five tablespoonfuls boiling water, one large table- 
spoonful of butter, one of ginger, a dash of cinnamon, one-half 
teaspoonful of salt and a large one of soda. Fill the cup with 
real New Orleans molasses (any other will cause a failure) and 
stir until the mixture foams over into the bowl. Make thicker 
with flour than any other kind of cake. Pour into a small cake 
pan, bake in a moderate oven and serve while hot. 

Broiled Whitefish and Hard-Boiled Eggs — Every kitchen 
should have a wire broiler to fit over an iron dripping-pan. On 
this place whitefish, well seasoned with salt and red pepper, and 
a few slices of breakfast bacon on top. Put in an evenly heated 
oven and broil without turning. Garnish with four hard-boiled 
eggs, pressed through the potato-masher. Butter the fish well 
after it is arranged on the platter. Serve with parsley and lemon. 

Browned Potatoes — Cut cold boiled potatoes into thick slices 
and brown each piece on both sides (being careful not to break 
them) in a larded spider. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. 

Orange Salad — Peel and cut four oranges into dice, place on 
lettuce leaves or in the halves of the orange skin and pour over 
a small cupful of rich salad dressing. Serve with toasted crack- 
ers. 

Jenny Linde— Make a thin batter of three eggs, two full table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter, pinch of salt, two teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder, pint of milk or water, a quart of flour. Bake on 
hot griddle in cakes the size of a small plate. Butter on the wrong 
side, spread with fruit-jam or marmalade, roll up, lay on a flat 
dish, sprinkle flne sugar over them. Serve hot with cream or 
hot lemon sauce. 

Lemon sauce — One tablespoonful butter, two of flour, three 
of sugar, and the yolk of one egg, rubbed into a smooth paste. 
Pour over the boiling water, stirring all the time to keep from 
getting "humpy." Let boil for ten minutes, or until it is of the 
consistency of cream. Flavor with lemon juice, adding nutmeg

and wine if desired. Beat the white of the egg to a froth and 
stir through just before sending to the table.

Orange pie. Coffee. 



Flannel Cakes — One tablespoonful of butter, one pint of flour, 
one saltspoonful of salt, two eggs, two cupfuls of milk, two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking-powder. Rub the butter into the flour and 
add the salt. Beat the yolks of the eggs light, add the milk to 
them and when well beaten stir the milk into the flour until quite 
smooth. Beat the whites light; add them, and lastly the bak- 
ing-powder, and bake on a hot griddle. 

Meat Balls — One pint of fine-chopped cold meat (any kind 
left over from previous dinner); add one cupful of bread or 
cracker crumbs, a little chopped onion, a little gravy mixed with 
the cracker crumbs to moisten them. Season with one-quarter 
teaspoonful of pepper, one-half teaspoonful of salt. Mold into 
balls and fry in hot lard or drippings. 

Sacked Potatoes — Select for baking potatoes as near of a size 
as possible; cut off each end, and when baked scoop out the in- 
side with a spoon, being careful not to break the skins. Add to 
the potato (for one-half dozen) one teaspoonful of butter, one 
teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter teaspoonful of pepper, one-half 
cupful of sweet milk. Beat until very light and smooth. Fill the 
skins with this and place in a greased pan and set on the oven 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 135 

grate until ends of potatoes are browned. The potatoes will puff 
up considerably if sufficiently beaten. Very nice. 

Fish Rechauffe — The fish left over from dinner may, by this 
process, be made into- a most palatable dish. Heat the fish in a 
frying-pan, removing the large bones if the fish is broken or has 
been cut, but if pan fish and whole do not break them. While 
heating, prepare the dressing. To one pound of fish allow one 
and one-half cupfuls of canned tomato, one level teaspoonful of 
salt, one egg (yolk), one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper. Stew the 
tomato until soft, strain through a coarse sieve to remove the 
ends, return to the stew-pan and add the salt and pepper. Beat 
the egg in two tablespoonfuls of cold water; when the tomato 
is boiling hot set the pan in a mild heat and add the yolk, stir- 
ring well. Do not boil the sauce after the egg is added, as it is 
likely to break. The heat should be just sufficient to cook the 
egg and thicken the tomato to the consistency of cream. Remove 
the fish to a platter, turn over it the sauce and serve. 

Thirded Biscuit — One cup of flour, one cup of Indian meal, 
one cup of rye flour, two cups of sour milk, into which put a 
heaping teaspoonful of soda, one large tablespoonful of sugar, a 
pinch of salt, two well beaten eggs. Mix the wheat and rye flour 
and Indian meal; add the milk, sugar, salt, and lastly the eggs. 
Bake in gem pans. 

One-Egg Lunch Cake — One tablespoonful of butter, one scant 
cup of sugar, one egg, one and one-half cups of flour, three-quar- 
ters cup of milk (scant), three-quarters cup of currants, one 
teaspoonful of baking powder. Rub butter and sugar to a 
cream, then add the well-beaten egg. Sift the flour and baking 
powder together; add them and milk to the mixture; beat well, 
then add the currants, which have been floured. Beat well and 
bake in a loaf pan or in small patty pans. 

Lenten Soup — Prepare three carrots, three turnips and three 
onions by scraping, peeling and washing. Slice them and fry 
them a golden brown in fresh lard or dripping. Cut up a head of 
celery and put in and fry a few moments also. Add to this two 
cloves, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper, a 
little parsley and a little grated nutmeg. Cover this with nearly 
three quarts of water and simmer three hours. This may be 
used instead of broth in the Lenten season. 

Veal Steaks — These are delicious broiled as beefsteak over a 
hot fire. The steak should be thinner than beefsteak to cook 
quickly through, and v/hen taken up on a heated platter should 
be spread with a little butter and sprinkled with salt and pepper. 
Take one and one-fourth pounds of veal steak, pound with sharp 
end of a small hammer and proceed as above. Or place in a 
pan with a lump of butter, salt and^ pepper sprinkled lightly over 
it, also a little flour, and bake in a hot oven about half an hour. 
This is truly delicious. 

Hominy Croquettes — One pint of cold hominy mush, one tea- 
spoonful of butter, two tablespoonfuls of milk, one teaspoonful 
of white sugar. Mix well, make into balls and dip in fine cracker 



136 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

crumbs or flour, and fry in hot lard a golden brown. Serve im- 
mediately quite hot. 

Orange Pie — To the grated rind of one-half a lemon and half 
the grated rind of one orange add the juice of both the orange 
and the lemon. Beat to a cream three-fourths of a cup of sugar, 
the yolks of two eggs and teaspoonful of butter. Heat in a bowl 
of hot water until of the consistency of cream and put into the 
pie crust and bake. Beat whites with two tablespoonfuls of 
sugar. When pies are done cover with meringue and set in the 
oven to harden. Miss S. S. Wilson.

season a pint of fish with one-half teaspoonful salt, one-quarter 
teaspoonful pepper and a few drops lemon juice. For a pint of 
fish make a sauce with four dessertspoonfuls of butter, two of 
flour, one pint milk, iii which a small slice of onion has been

boiled. Pour the sauce over the seasoned fish, mix, arrange in a 
platter, sprinkle with bread crumbs (buttered) and bake in a hot 
oven from twenty to thirty minutes. A speck of cayenne is a 
good addition to the sauce. 

Fried Grits — Boil a small cup of grits in one quart salted 
water until tender; then pour in a platter one-half inch thick 
to cook. When cold cut in small slices, flour slightly and brown 
both sides on a hot griddle greased well with butter or lard. 

Graham Gems — One cup milk, half-teaspoon salt, half-cup 
white flour, one cup graham flour, two tablespoons sugar, one 
tablespoon melted butter, half-teaspoon soda (slightly scanted), 
one teaspoon cream of tartar. Sift and measure graham flour; 
add soda, cream of tartar and white flour, and sift again. Mix 
milk, salt, sugar together and stir into flour. Last, put in the 
melted butter, heat for a minute, then drop a spoonful in each 
division of a gem pan, which should be well greased and made 
very hot on top of stove. Bake in hot oven from twenty-five to 
thirty minutes. 

Snow Cakes — Half-tablespoon butter, one tablespoon sugar, 
whites of two eggs, one and one-half cups flour, one saltspoon 
salt, one and one-half teaspoons baking powder, one cup milk. 
Sift flour, salt and baking powder together four times. Cream 
the butter and sugar with a little of the milk; add the whites of 
the eggs well beaten, the rest of the milk, and, last, the flour. 
Bake this batter in hot buttered gem pans from twenty to thirty 
minutes, or you can bake in small round earthen cups. These 
cakes are delicious eaten hot for lunch or tea. 

Duchess Potatoes — One pint potatoes, one teaspoon butter, 
half teaspoon salt, one egg, one and one-quarter spoons white 
pepper. Wash, pare and boil potatoes. When dry and mealy 
put in the butter, salt, pepper and mash them thoroughly and 
quickly. Add the egg, well beaten, and three tablespoonfuls of 
cream or milk. Mix and form into a flat cake half-inch thick. 
Cut into oblongs or squares or shape into balls, brush over with 
white of egg or milk and bake in a hot oven until a delicate 
brown. 

Egg Cream — Two eggs, two tablespoons sugar, piece grated 
rind of half a lemon. Separate the yolks from the whites and 
beat in a bowl with the sugar until both are well mixed. Then 
put in the lemon and place the bowl in a dish of boiling water 
on the fije. Stir slowly until the mixture begins to thicken. Then 
add the beaten whites of the eggs and stir for two minutes, or 
until the whole resembles very thick cream. Remove from fire, 
pour into small china cups and set it away to cool. Double the 
recipe when needed. 

Tomato Soup — Let the canned tomatoes stew only just long 
enough to soften through. When they are soft strain through a 
soup-strainer or coarse wire-strainer until there is nothing left 
but the seeds. Measure a pint of the liquid, add one teaspoon 
S3 It. one saltspoon pepper, one-half saltspoon of soda and set it 
in the stove to heat slowly. Meanwhile make a white sauce, with 
one tablespoon butter, one of flour and one pint milk, thus: Set 



138 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

the milk on fire in a sauce-pan to heat; put the butter and flour 
in another pan on the fire and stir gently until the butter melts; 
let them bubble together two or three minutes, then pour in milk, 
a little at a time, until all is used; stir so it will be smooth, until 
it bubbles; add this sauce "to the tomato, strain all again, return 
to fire and serve as soon as steaming hot. 

Stewed Chicken — One chicken, weighing about three pounds, 
cut into pieces, as for serving; wash in cold water, then put in 
sauce-pan, with one quart boiling water; cover and let simmer 
an hour; then add one teaspoonful salt, one-quarter teaspoonful 
pepper, a very small sliced onion, one dozen celery seeds; cover 
and let simmer until perfectly tender; several hours. Just before 
dinner time add a small cup of milk, in which has been dissolved 
one teaspoonful of cornstarch; stir slowly until it all comes to 
a boil and begins to thicken like cream; add teaspoon of very 
fine chopped parsley, over all, when dished. 

Rice Croquettes — One cupful boiled rice, one-half cup milk, 
one egg, one tablespoon sugar, one of butter, one-half teaspoon 
salt, a slight grating of nutmeg. Put milk on to boil and add rice 
and seasoning. When it boils up add the egg well beaten. Stir 
one minute; take off and cool. When cold, shape and roll in 
egg and crumbs and brown a few at a time in hot fat. 

Coffee Jelly — One-fourth box gelatine, dissolved in one-half 
cup cold v/ater an hour, then one cup boiling water, one cup very 
strong coffee, one-half cup sugar, one-half teaspoon vanilla (or 
this may be left out). The coffee should be made with the pro- 
portion of two tablespoons of coffee to a cup of water, coffee 
should also be added boiling hot; after the boiling water then 
the sugar. When all is dissolved strain and set away to cool. 
Serve with sweet cream, and sugar if desired. Nelson's gelatine 
is the most delicate. The cup for boiling water and coffee should 
hold half a pint. The cold water measure in a teacup. If jelly 
is liked very sweet two-thirds of a cup of sugar can be used. 

Sponge Cake — Three eggs, one cup flour, three tablespoons 
cold v/ater, one cup sugar, two even teaspoons baking powder, 
flavor as preferred, beat white of eggs stiff and set aside, sift 
flour with baking powder twice, beat yolks of eggs very light, 
add sugar, beat well together, then add cold water, the flour, a 
little at a time, and last the whites. Have gem pans well buttered, 
half fill and bake at once in a good oven. This will make about 
a dozen nice small cakes, Mrs. Thomas Turtle.

Mix all well together, then make into cakes or balls; beat up 
the whites of two eggs a little, dip the cakes into the whites, then

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 141 

tablespoon of sugar, one pint of milk, one-half teaspoon of salt,

teaspoon of pepper. Put the meat into a well-buttered pudding- 
dish. Thicken a scant pint of gravy or stock with one table- 
spoon of flour rubbed smooth with half a tablespoon of butter;

pan and brown it quickly in a hot oven. When the veal is brown 
season it highly with salt and pepper, then pour one pint of 
canned tomatoes over it and bake until the veal is well done. 
Take it up with the tomatoes on the same dish and serve hot. 
This is a favorite southern way of cooking veal. 

Amber Pudding — Into a quart of boiling milk stir a teacup of 
cornmeal and a quart of sliced sweet apples; add a half- teaspoon 
of salt and a teacup of molasses. Mix thoroughly. Add two 
quarts of milk; pour into a large buttered dish and bake in a

halves and lay in a vegetable dish. Have ready a sauce like the 
following: Put in a saucepan one cup of milk, stir in carefully 
one scant tablespoonful of melted butter and two chopped hard- 
boiled eggs, one teaspoonful of salt and a shake of pepper. Heat 
together thoroughly and pour all over the potatoes. Serve hot. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 143 

Brown Bread — One even cup of Indian meal, two heaping 
cups rye meal, one teaspoonful of salt, one small teaspoonful of 
soda, one cup of molasses. Mix very thoroughly together the 
meal, salt and soda. Add one pint of hot water to the molasses 
and stir. Pour the molasses and water into the middle of the 
meal and stir till a smooth batter. Put in a buttered tin, cover 
tightly and set over a kettle of hot water and steam three hours. 
Then set in the oven for ten minutes. 

New England Fire Cakes — Make a pie crust not quite as rich 
as for puff paste. Cut off small pieces and roll out to about the 
size of a breakfast plate and as nearly round as possible. Have 
a griddle over the fire. Grease and place one cake on it and bake 
a nice brov/n. Turn it when done on one side and brown nicely 
on the other. When done put on a plate and butter it well. 
Spread a layer of preserved straw^berries or raspberries on it. 
Have ready another cake and bake. Pile one upon the other and 
butter and spread layers of preserves until all the pastry you 
have made is cooked. Serve quite hot. Cut down through all 
the layers. It is an old-fashioned New England cake and in 
olden times was cooked in iron spiders propped up before the 
kitchen fire; hence its name. It is a very nice shortcake to be 
eaten hot for luncheon or supper. 

Beets — Wash and put them on to boil. An inch of the stalk 
should be left on to prevent their "bleeding." The time for boil- 
ing depends on the age of the beets. When young one hour is 
suflacient; when older several hours are required to make them 
tender. When done skim them and slice them, then season with 
salt, pepper and a little butter and enough vinegar to nearly cover. 

Baked Corn — One can of corn. Add one cup of boiling milk, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful of salt and one- 
fourth teaspoonful of pepper. Put in a baking-dish, dot over 
small bits of butter and bake in a moderate oven three-quarters 
of an hour. 

Cake Pudding — Take six thin, stale pieces of cake, spread 
them sparingly with currant jelly. Blanch two dozen almoftds 
and split them; stick them in the cake and lay the pieces of cake 
in a shallow dish or small platter. Make a soft custard of one 
large coffeecup of milk, one egg, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
one-half teaspoonful of vanilla. Pour over the cake and serve.

with five tablespoonfuls of white sugar; beat one-half pint of 
cream to a stiff froth, add the pounded fruit and a tablespoonful

salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. Have ready baked a good pie 
crust in the usual pie plate, fill with onion mixture and set in 
oven long enough to brown on top. No upper crust. A most 
excellent German dish. 

Apple Salad — Peel and core three nice apples. Cut in small 
pieces as you would celery for chicken salad. Squeeze the juice 
of a large lemon over at once to keep from turning dark. Cut up 
half as much of white celery. When ready to use put together 
with French salad dressing and serve on lettuce leaves.

fresh halibut; cook slowly until done; remove from the water

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 147 

Baked Halibut Steaks — Trim the steaks, lay them in a roast- 
ing pan, and for two pounds use one cup of cream, one teaspoon 
of flour, one tablespoon of butter, one teaspoon of salt and one 
saltspoon of pepper. Dredge the steaks with the flour, add the 
seasoning and dot with the butter; then pour over the cream and 
bake fifteen minutes in a quick oven. These are delicious. 

Pauline Mufiins — One pint flour, one pint milk, two eggs, one 
tablespoon sugar, one tablespoon butter, two teaspoons baking 
powder, one-half teaspoon salt. Mix and sift together the flour, 
baking powder and salt, rub the butter and sugar, then mix the 
flour with it to a cream; add the eggs and beat until smooth. 
Then pour in the milk and beat rapidly until very light. Pour 
into buttered muflin rings and bake in a quick oven. 

Delicate Cake — One and one-half cups of sugar, one-half cup 
butter, beat to a cream; then add the well-beaten whites of six 
eggs and one-half cup milk, one and one-half cups flour, one-half 
cup cornstarch and two teaspoons baking powder. Sift flour, corn- 
starch and baking powder together. Beat thoroughly, flavor with 
one-half teaspoon of almond and bake in moderate oven. Sufii- 
cient for three days. 

Chocolate Cream — Soak one-half box of gelatine in one-half 
cup of cold water one hour. Add to the same one-half cup grated 
chocolate, one-half pound of white sugar and one pint milk; stir 
all together and boil flve minutes by placing the vessel in another 
of boiling water, then add one-half pint of rich cream; boil one 
minute. Flavor with one teaspoon of extract of vanilla and pour 
into molds to cool. The mold should be wet with cold water, 
as the jelly slips out easier. Suflicient for two meals and should 
be kept cool. 

Almond Milk— Almond milk is a delicious beverage, but it 
does not keep long and should be made a short time before it 
is needed. Take three dozen fresh almonds, blanch by pouring 
boiling water over them and removing the skins; then pound to 
a paste; add one gill of boiling water, strain, and then add one 
quart of cold water and one-half cup sugar. Set on the ice until 
ready for use. 

Duchess Soup— One quart of milk, two onions, three eggs, two 
tablespoons of butter, two of flour, one-half teaspoon salt, one 
saltspoon pepper and two tablespoons grated cheese. Put the milk 
on to boil. Fry the butter and onions together for eighteen min- 
utes; then add the dry flour and cook two minutes longer, being 
careful not to burn. Blend with the milk, and cook ten minutes. 
Rub through a strainer, and return to the fire. Now add the 
cheese, salt and pepper. Beat the eggs, dilute with two table- 
spoons of the soup, strain, and pour slowly into the soup, stirring 
it briskly. It must not boil again, but should stand hot for three 
minutes. 

Steamed Chicken— Wipe very dry after cleaning. Rub one 
teaspoon salt, one saltspoon pepper and two tablespoons butter 
in the cavity of the body; fill it with oysters seasoned with a 



148 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

saltspoon salt, one-half saltspoon pepper and one of celery salt. 
Tie the legs and wings close to the body, and lay in as small a 
dish as will hold it, set in a steamer and steam four hours. Mean- 
time cook a pint of chopped celery till it will rub through a puree 
sieve. Make a pint of white sauce with the liquor of the oysters, 
add the celery to it and pour it over the fowl on the platter. Gar- 
nish with curly parsley. 

Creamed Apple Tart — Line a small deep pudding dish with 
pastry, pack in one and one-half pints of cut apples with three- 
fourths cup brown sugar and grated rind and juice of one lemon. 
Cover and bake till well done. Lift the crust and pour in one 
pint of whipped cream. Do not return the upper crust, but set 
aside and serve when ice cold. Miss Birdie Stenson.

of germea. Stir thoroughly while it cooks from three to five 
minutes. Serve with cream and sugar. Wheaten "foods" are 
difficult to prepare free from lumps; to avoid these remember the 
following rules: 

Water must be at a bubbling, frothing heat. 

"Food must be added to water in very small quantities, and 
each addition must be thoroughly absorbed before adding more 
of the 'food'." 

Eggs, New York Style — Boil six eggs one-half hour, drop into 
cold water, shell and quarter. Place in buttered baking-dish hold- 
ing about three pints. Prepare a white sauce as follows: Heat 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 149 

one pint milk, melt in a saucepan one tablespoon butter, stir into 
the butter two tablespoons (rounded) flour, add one-quarter of 
the hot milk and stir vigorously till the mixture is a smooth 
paste. The remainder of the milk may be added at three separate 
times, stirring in each addition till it is smoothly blended. Season 
with one-half teaspoon salt and one-quarter teaspoon white pep- 
per. Chop two large cold boiled seasoned onions; stir onions 
into the sauce and pour over the eggs. Sprinkle over the top 
one-half cup cracker crumbs, moistened with one tablespoon 
melted butter, add two tablespoons grated cheese for a top layer 
and bake in a hot oven about fifteen or twenty minutes until 
crumbs and cheese are slightly brown. 

Sweet Muffins — One-half cup butter rubbed to a cream. One- 
half cup sugar stirred into the butter. Add two well-beaten eggs. 
Stir and mix thoroughly. Add one cup sweet milk and three and 
three-quarter cups winter wheat flour. Three rounded teaspoons 
baking powder should be sifted into the flour after measuring, 
and the flour and baking powder sifted together into the muffin 
mixture. Bake in gem pans about twenty-five minutes. 

Banked Salmon — Place a can of salmon after opening in hot 
water. Let it remain until heated through. Peel and quarter 
about six large potatoes. When boiled, add one tablespoon butter, 
one tablespoon salt, half a saltspoon pepper and milk or cream to 
moisten. Mash and beat with a fork till light and creamy. While 
potatoes are boiling prepare a white sauce like that given above 
for the eggs. Drain the liquor from the salmon, break it into 
flakes with a fork and arrange in the middle of a platter. Heap 
the hot mashed potatoes around the salmon and pour over all 
the white sauce. Garnish edges of platter with bits of parsley. 

Stewed Dried Pears — One-half pound of pears. Wash well 
and separate carefully. Soak over night in three pints of clear, 
soft water. In the morning place them on to boil in this same 
water. Boil till pears are tender. Lift them out carefully and 
add to the water in which they were boiled one-half cup of gran- 
ulated sugar. Cook to a thick, rich sirup. Pour over pears and 
serve when cold. All dried fruits are very good when cooked in 
this way. 

Sponge Gingerbread — One cup sour milk, one cup dark, strong 
molasses, one-half cup butter, one-half cup sugar, one egg, one 
teaspoon soda, one tablespoon ginger, two heaping cups winter 
wheat flour (if patent flour is used make the cups even). Warm 
butter, molasses and ginger together, add milk, flour, eggs and 
soda (also a pinch of salt) and bake immediately. 

Puree of Chicken and Rice — One cup cold chicken cut in small 
pieces, one cup cold boiled rice, well mashed; place chicken in a 
soup kettle, with a tablespoonful butter or drippings, and fry 
till brown; sift in two tablespoonfuls dry flour; when flour is 
brown add rice and two quarts boiling water; season with one 
heaping teaspoonful salt and four pepper corns and one-half salt- 
spoon pepper. Cook slowly several hours until meat and rice 



150 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

are tender enough to rub through a colander; return pulp to 
kettle; if thicker than thick cream add more boiling water. 
Serve hot. 

Roast from the Round — A slice three inches thick from the 
best part of the top of the round; dredge with salt, pepper and 
flour; place in a hot oven with one-half pint hot water and one 
tablespoonful butter or good drippings in the pan; baste often 
and bake about an hour, as this roast is not good if too well done. 

Gravy — Pour into the pan, after removing the roast, one pint 
hot water or stock; melt in a saucepan a tablespoonful butter or 
good drippings, and when browned stir in two heaping tablespoon- 
fus flour; stir until the flour is brown and well mixed with the 
butter; add, a little at a time, the hot liquid from the roasting- 
pan and stir in till it is smooth and thick; season with salt and 
pepper to taste. Strain and serve. 

Browned Potatoes — Pare six or eight potatoes of medium size. 
Leave them whole and place in cold water for an hour. Boil until 
almost done. Drain and when they are quite dry drop into hot 
fat and brown like doughnuts. Serve at once, well sprinkled with 
salt. This is an excellent way to prepare potatoes so late in the 
season. 

Blanc Mange — One quart of milk (reserving three tablespoons 
with which to mix three tablespoons corn starch) with a pinch of 
salt and five tablespoons sugar. When milk is hot pour in the 
mixed corn starch and- stir until it is a thick batter. Pour this 
on the well beaten whites of four eggs and stir carefully. Pour 
into frappe glasses, only enough to half fill them. Serve when 
cold with the caramel sauce. 

Caramel Sauce — Mix two cups of sugar with two tablespoons 
of water in a saucepan. Stir till it becomes a dark brown color. 
Add two cups of boiling water cautiously as it hisses and sputters. 
Cook gently for ten minutes longer. Let it cool and serve in a 
small pitcher, pouring it over the blanc mange as it is in the 
little frappe cups. Mary Demlng.

Mock snow pudding. 
Coffee. 



Wheat Griddle Cakes— One pint of flour, one-quarter tea- 
spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of soda, one pint of sour milk, 
scant measure, and two eggs. Crush, measure and sift the soda 
and salt in the flour; mix thoroughly; add the milk, and beat 
well, then the beaten yolks, and lastly the whites beaten to a 
stiff froth. Bake on a hot, well-greased griddle. This recipe can 
be varied by using one-half or one-third fine cornmeal or graham 
flour. 

Crullers — One cupful of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, 
two eggs, one cupful of rich milk, three cupfuls of flour mixed 
with tv/o teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one small level teaspoon- 
ful of salt; use flour enough to roll; cut in two-inch squares, 
and cut each square in "slashes"; fry in hot lard. When cool 
roll in fine sugar. This recipe will make enough for five or six 
breakfasts. 

Chipped Beef — Take one-half pound of finely shaved dried 
beef; put in a saucepan land add enough cold water to cover it. 
When scalding hot (boiling toughens it) drain off the water, add 
One large tablespoonful of butter, and a slight sprinkling of pep- 
per; let it simmer gently for ten minutes. When ready to serve 
add three or four tablespoonfuls of cream. This will be found a 
pleasant change from the thickened gravy .with which it is usually 
served. 

Potato Dice — Pare and cut into dice-shape five medium-size 
potatoes; put into a saucepan with enough hot water to cover, 
and one-half teaspoon of salt; cook till tender, drain and pour 
over them two or three tablespoonfuls of melted butter and serve 
at once. 

Cornstarch Puffs — One cupful of pulverized sugar, one-half 
cupful of butter, one cupful of cornstarch, two teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder, one teaspoonful of vanilla, four eggs. Rub the 
butter and sugar to a cream, add the beaten yolks of the eggs; 
beat the whites of the eggs very stiff and add alternately with the 
cornstarch and baking powder mixed. Bake in well-greased gem 
tins, which should be heated before putting the batter in. Bake 
in a rather quick oven. When cool frost. This recipe will make 
twenty puffs, and they will keep several days. 

Veal Potpie — Three pounds of veal, rinse thoroughly, put in 
kettle and cover with boiling water; add one heaping teaspoonful 
of salt, and remove the scum as it rises; then add one large 
spoonful of butter and a saltspoonful of pepper; when nearly done 
lay six or eight medium-size pared potatoes on the meat; make 
a batter of one and a half pints of flour, two teaspoonfuls of bak- 



152 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK 

ing powder, a saltspoon of salt and one cupful of sweet milk; 
drop a spoonful at a time either on the meat or in the steamer 
placed over the kettle. Do not remove the cover for thirty min- 
utes, for if the air strikes them they will "fall." Take up the 
meat, potatoes and "dumplings" on a large platter; wet two 
tablespoons of flour in a little cold water, rub till smooth and stir 
in the broth; add another tablespoonful of butter and cook till 
it thickens, then pour over the potpie. 

Mock Snow Pudding — Three tablespoons of cornstarch wet 
with enough cold water to dissolve it and a pinch of salt; pour 
over this one pint of boiling water; cook five minutes, stirring 
constantly; add the whites of three eggs beaten to*a stiff froth. 
Wet a mold in cold water and pour the mixture in. Make a cus- 
tard of the yolks of the three eggs, one-half a cupful of sugar and 
one cupful of milk; let it come to a boil, but do not allow it to 
curdle; flavor. When ready to serve turn the white part out 
on an ice-cream platter or flat dish and pour the custard around it.

Mutton Chops, Grilled — One and one-quarter pounds of chops. 
Cut the chops an inch thick, either from the loin or the best end 
of the neck; if from the latter, the bones must be shortened a 
little. Remove all superfluous fat, and season each chop by press- 
ing in a mixture of a teaspoonful of salt and a half teaspoonful of 
pepper, and powdered herbs, if you like them; then dip each 
chop in warmed butter or dripping and broil on a gridiron over 
a clear fire from eight to ten minutes, according to thickness. 
During the process of cooking the chops require to be frequently 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 153 

turned in order that they may be done equally, and for this pur- 
pose use a pair of steak tongs. By inserting any sort of a sharp 
instrument into meat that is cooking we provide a ready means 
of escape for the juices which the meat contains, and thus being 
deprived of its best element it becomes dry and tasteless. When 
cooked, place each chop, just slightly overlapping its neighbor, 
upon a hot dish; pour over each a dessertspoonful of hot butter 
and a tablespoonful of hot catchup and serve immediately. 

Creamed Potatoes — At this time of year one is apt to have 
a quantity of small-sized potatoes, and here is a good way in 
which to dispose of some of them: Take two dozen small po- 
tatoes, allow one pint of milk, one tablespoonful of butter, one 
and one-half tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, one-half teaspoonful 
of salt. Moisten the cornstarch in a half-cupful of the milk, 
place the rest of the milk on the fire, and when scalding hot add 
the cornstarch mixture. Cook until again scalding hot, set on 
the back of the fire and add the butter and salt. Have the po- 
tatoes, peeled perfectly with no speck of the thin skin to be seen, 
boiled until tender and drained and sprinkled with salt. Place 
these in the serving dish, pour over them the cream dressing, 
dust slightly with pepper and serve at once. 

Hot Corn-Bread — One-half pint of buttermilk, one-half pint 
of sweet milk, one-half teaspoonful of soda, two eggs, three table- 
spoonfuls of cornmeal, one teaspoonful of salt. Mix the butter- 
milk, sweet milk and soda together, and when the soda is thor- 
oughly dissolved pour these over the beaten eggs. Add the corn- 
meal and beat well. Place the pan in which it is to be baked 
on the stove, with a heaping tablespoonful of lard in it. As soon 
as this is melted evenly and shaken upon the sides, pour in the 
batter, put into a quick oven and bake a delicate brown. 

Oyster Patties — Make a crust of one cup of flour, one-half cup 
of lard, one-half cup of very cold water, one-half saltspoonful of 
salt. Mix lightly together, roll out and line small patty-pans with 
it. Take one-half pint of milk, a tablespoonful of flour, the same 
of butter. Dissolve the flour in a little of the milk, and add to the 
rest of the milk, which has first been heated. Let this become 
boiling hot, and then stir in a few gratings of nutmeg and 
a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Lastly, add one-half pint of oys- 
ters, salt, and let it boil up once. Then put four oysters 
and some of the gravy into each patty-pan, cover with crust and 
bake in a quick oven. 

Cookies of 1812 — One pint of sugar, one teacup of butter, four 
eggs, two tablespoons of sweet milk, one-half teaspoon 
of soda, one teaspoon of cream of tartar, one-half nutmeg, 
one teaspoon of vanilla, one pint of flour. Roll the 
sugar (granulated) until quite fine; add the butter and cream 
them. Stir in the milk gradually, and beat the eggs separately, 
and then put together and beat again. Add to the mixture but- 
ter, sugar and milk, and lastly the fiour and soda, which has been 
dissolved in a little warm water. After these have been well 
mixed add the nutmeg and vanilla. Beat all well together, and 



154 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

add enough flour to handle well in rolling and cutting out. Bake 
in a moderate oven a delicate brown. These keep well. 

Boiled Fresh Cod — A good recipe for cod, salmon, shad or 
any other fresh fish. Let the fish remain in cold water slightly 
salted for an hour before it is time to cook it. Wrap it then in 
a clean towel that has been well covered with flour. Fasten the 
towel closely and put on to boil for half an hour in salted water. 
Take it up and put on a heated platter and pour the sauce over it. 

Fish Sauce — To one teacup of milk add one teacup of water; 
put it on the fire to scald, and when hot stir in a tablespoon of 
flour previously wet with cold water. Add two eggs well beaten, 
a half-teaspoonful of salt, a shake of pepper and a tablespoon of 
butter. Boil two eggs hard, take off the shells, slice and lay 
over the fish. Then pour over the sauce and serve. 

Rice Cakes — Moisten a large coffee cup of cold boiled rice 
with enough sweet milk to make a smooth paste, add a table- 
spoonful of melted butter, & small half-teaspoonful of salt, an 
even teaspoonful of sugar and a well-beaten egg. Make into balls 
or cakes and fry in hot lard. These are good with hot meats also. 

Cheese Salad — Odd bits of cheese to the amount of a pound, 
grated, one hard-boiled egg, one teaspoonful of cayenne pepper, 
one of salt, one of white sugar, one of made mustard, one table- 
spoonful of vinegar, one of salad oil or melted butter. Rub the 
yolk of the egg to a paste with the oil or butter, adding in order 
the salt, pepper, sugar, mustard, and lastly the cheese. Work 
all well together before putting in the vinegar. These mixtures 
bear a marvelous resemblance in taste to a deviled crab, and 
make a very good impromptu relish to eat with crackers and but- 
ter. This is still better if you can add a cupful of cold minced 
chicken. 

Silver Pie — Peel and grate one large white potato into a deep 
plate; add the juice and grated rind of one lemon, the beaten 
white of one egg, one teacupful of white sugar and one cup of 
cold water. Stir, well together and pour into a nice under-crust 
and bake. When done have ready the beaten whites of two 
eggs well beaten, half a teacupful of white sugar and a few drops 
of lemon, all thoroughly beaten. Put this mixture on the top 
of the pie evenly and return to the oven to stiffen a few mo- 
ments. When sent to the table just cold lay a teaspoonful of 
jelly on the center of each piece, to ornament, if you wish.

Velvet Mush — Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter in a porce- 
lain kettle; cook in this two coffeecupfuls of wheat flour until 
it slips the spoon and the kettle; have five cups of milk ready 
boiled and add to the flour, one cupful at a time. Let boil be- 
tween each cupful. Add one teaspoonful of salt; stir thoroughly 
and serve. 

German Omelet — Five eggs, five tablespoonfuls cream or rich 
milk, six thin slices of bacon, one-half teaspoonful fine-chopped 
parsley. Beat the eggs and cream together and put in the pars- 
ley. Let the bacon simmer in boiling water for five minutes. Put a 
piece of butter in the frying-pan, the size of a hickory nut; let 
brown; then pour in a thin layer of the egg batter; now lay on 
the bacon and pour in remainder of batter. Must be fried over 
slow hard-coal fire. When it begins to stiffen then turn, which 
can be done successfully this way: Put tiny pieces of butter 
on a lid which fits the spider; press lid against spider and turn; 
then slide back in the pan and brown on the other side. 

German Coffee Cake — Set a sponge with one pint lukewarm 
milk, a two-cent cake of yeast, a half teaspoonful 
of salt and half a pound of flour. Let rise by 
the stove for two hours, then stir in half cup of melted 
butter, one cup of raisins, one-quarter of a cup of finely cut citron, 
one cup of sugar, three eggs. Knead in enough fiour to make a 
stiff dough — about one pound — then part the dough in three even 
pieces, roll them out separately, long and thin, then braid to- 
gether and form round in the pan. Let rise again and bake a 
good half-hour. Frost. Sufiicient for two meals. 

Gentleman's Favorite Cake — Beat six egg yolks with half- 
cup butter and two cups sugar; then add two cups water with 
half a teaspoonful soda dissolved in it, tv/o cups of flour with one 
teaspoonful of baking powder, and last the whipped whites. Bake 
in layers. Filling: One egg, one cup of sugar, three grated ap- 
ples, juice and grated rind of one lemon; stir over the fire till 
it boils and gets thick; let cool and put between layers. Sh^ke 
powdered sugar over cake when served. 

Jellied Whitefish — Two pounds whitefish boiled in one and 
three-quarters quarts of water seasoned with two teaspoonfuls 



156 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

salt, one gill vinegar, four bay leaves, one tablespoonful of whole 
pepper and cloves. When tender take the fish out, strain the 
soup and return to the fire, with the white of an egg to clear it; 
remove from fire; add the juice of a lemon and two ounces of 
gelatine, first dissolved in water. Then strain again, and when 
cool, but not cold, pour over the fish. Turn on a platter when 
served and garnish with parsley. Enough for two meals. 

Rice Bread — Quarter pound of rice, two pounds of flour, one- 
half tablespoonful salt, one cake of yeast, one pint lukewarm 
water. Sew rice in a sack, but leave sufficient room to let it swell; 
put the sack in boiling water and let cook for three hours. Dis- 
solve yeast and salt in water, mix with rice and knead in two 
pounds of flour. Let rise, then put in bread pans and treat as 
common wheat bread. Very healthy. 

Ginger Ale — One and three-quarters pounds sugar, one and 
one-half ounces whole ginger, two and one-half ounces cream 
tartar, one lemon sliced, seven quarts boiling water, 2-cents yeast. 
Put sugar and spices in a stone jar, pour over the boiling water 
and let stand twenty-four hours in a cool place covered. Then 
put yeast in, dissolve in lukewarm water, and let stand again 
twenty-four hours, then fill in bottles, cork well, and after three 
days it is ready to serve. 

Orange Jelly — Dissolve one ounce of gelatine in half a pint 
of water, mix in one quart of boiling water, three cups of sugar, 
the juice of three lemons. When well dissolved, squeeze in the 
juice from eight oranges, then strain and put away to cool. 
Meant for two desserts. 

Boneless Birds — For this use round steak sliced thin. Cut 
in pieces about three to four inches wide and five to six inches 
long. Sprinkle salt and pepper on one side; put in a narrow 
piece of bacon, two inches long and one-half an inch wide, a 
piece of carrot same size; now roll the meat like a thick sausage, 
get the shape of a bird without head or feet as much as you can, 
and wind around with string, then rub with allspice, salt and 
pepper and roll in fiour. Brown well in butter in which you have 
grated an onion, then add stock or boiling water until covered, 
cook slowly for two hours, then take out the birds, strain gravy 
and thicken with one teaspoonful of flour made smooth in a little 
water, add a pinch of salt. Should the stock or water steam away 
while cooking more must be added — but always boiling hot. 

Succotash — Half a pound of lima beans soaked six hours; 
cook till tender; add one can of corn, one teaspoonful of salt, one 
piece of butter size of walnut; bring to boil and serve.

Cream Hash — Chop mutton, veal or beef as fine as for hash 
and as much as is needed. Fry for a few minutes in salt pork drip- 
pings. Take from the fire and in the same frying-pan make a 
rich cream gravy, if cream is a possibility; if not, use milk, 
thickening it with cornstarch and adding a generous lump of 
butter. Pour half of the gravy into a pan over the fire, thin it 
with hot water, dip in it slices of well-browned toast, lay the 
moistened toast upon a flat dish and set in a warm place. Into 
the thick cream gravy put the minced meat, cook it five minutes, 
then spread it upon the toast. Delicious. 

Sweet Potato Croquettes — For eight croquettes use one-half 
cupful hot milk, two tablespoonfuls butter, one-half teaspoonful 
salt, two eggs, enough boiled sweet potato to make a pint; bread 
crumbs. When the potatoes have been mashed smooth and light, 
beat into them the hot milk, and then the salt and butter; next 
beat one egg until light, and beat this into the mixture, which 
should be shaped into croquettes; beat the second egg in a soup 
plate; cover croquettes with egg, and roll them in bread crumbs; 
fry in fat till they turn brown. Serve at once.

ful baking powder and one tablespoonful cinnamon. Bake in a 
moderate oven in patty tins. 

Iced Apples — Pare and core one dozen large apples, fill with 
sugar and a little butter and nutmeg, bake until nearly done, 
let cool, and remove to another plate, if it can be done without 
breaking them (if not, pour off the juice). Ice tops and sides 
with caking-ice and brown lightly. Serve with cream. 

Turtle Bean Soup — Soak one pint of black beans over night, 
then put them into three quarts of water with beef bones or a 
small piece of lean salt pork; boil three or four hours, strain, 
season with salt, pepper, cloves and lemon juice. Put in a few 
slices of lemon, and if wished add slices of hard-boiled eggs. 
Serve with toasted bread cut into dice and placed in the tureen. 

Simple Fruit Pudding — Stew currants or any small fruits, 
fresh or dried, with sugar to taste, and pour hot over thin slices 
of bakers' bread with crust cut off, making alternate layers Of fruit 
and bread and leaving a thick layer of fruit for the last. Put 
on top a plate and bake in a moderate oven, and when cool set 
on ice. Serve with sifted sugar or with cream and sugar.

Perfection Omelet — Separate yolks and whites of five eggs. 
Beat yolks very light, add one small half-teaspoonful salt, one- 
sixth teaspoonful pepper, one teaspoonful parsley chopped very 
fine, two tablespoonfuls milk, two teaspoonfuls finely chopped 
cold ham and lastly the whites of eggs beaten so stiff you can 
turn the bowl without their slipping. Pour mixture in well- 
buttered, hot frying-pan. Allow it to remain on top of stove one 
minute, then cover and place in hot oven for four minutes. Re- 
move the cover, fold omelet over with cake turner and serve 
immediately on hot platter garnished with parsley. 

Rice Waflles — One-half cup of cornmeal and one-half cup of 
flour sifted with one teaspoonful of baking powder and one tea- 
spoonful of salt. Add one cup of cold boiled rice, one cup of milk, 
one tablespoonful of melted butter and two eggs thoroughly 
beaten. Beat the mixture well before baking and see that your 
waffle-irons are hot and well greased. 

Bouillon — This, as well as the chicken pie and the Easter 
trifle, should be made on Saturday. Two pounds of beef from 
the middle of the round, a small beef-bone, two quarts cold water, 
one teaspoonful salt, four peppercorns, four cloves, one table- 
spoonful chopped parsley, a slice of onion and half a carrot. 
Wipe and cut the meat into small pieces, add the water and heat 
slowly; when near the boiling point skim it, taking care the scum 
does not break. After the scum is off throw in a wine glass of 
cold water; when it is once again near boiling skim again; re- 
peat the cold water and skimming twice, then add the seasoning 
and let boil slowly for four hours. It will boil down to three 
pints; strain and set aside. When ready for use remove the fat 
from top, heat to boiling point and serve in cups. The quantity 
is sufficient for two meals. 

Chicken Pie — Put the neck, gizzard and heart of a chicken in 
a pint of cold water with a small teaspoonful of salt, slice of onion 
and small piece of carrot. Let them stew slowly until there is 
not more than half a cup of liquid, which strain and put aside. 
Cut half a pound of veal cutlet into small pieces and lay on the 
bottom of a two-quart baking dish; sprinkle over it a scant salt- 
spoonful of salt and half as much pepper; shave sweet salt pork 
and add a thin layer of that; cut the chicken into small joints, 
sprinkling each with salt and pepper, and lay it in, piling always 
toward the center. Then drop into the pan wherever there is a 
chink forcemeat balls made in this way: Into a cup of fine bread 
crumbs, mixed with a heaping teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 
cut a heaping teaspoonful of butter, and moisten with an egg 
mixed with a little cold water; add saltspoonful of salt and half 
the quantity of pepper and make into little round balls. For puff 
paste for crust, chop together two-thirds of a cup of butter, one 
and one-half cups of flour sifted with half a teaspoonful of salt, 
mix with scant cup of cold water, roll out into crust half an inch 
thick. Cut strips two inches broad, wet the edges of the dish and 
lay the strips around. Lay on the paste for top crust, pressing it 
to the outer strips; trim round with sharp knife, make good-

sized hole in center, ornament with twisted paste; brush all over 
with white of egg (not the edges, or they will not rise) and bake 
an hour and a half in a steady oven. Before it is cold pour the 
gravy made from giblets through the hole in the top, using a 
funnel for the purpose. This pie is excellent cold, but if you pre- 
fer it hot, place it in moderate oven for a half hour, laying a 
paper over to protect crust. By the addition of a half pint of 
oysters "plumped" in their liquor the remainder of the pie will 
serve for a second day's dinner. 

Oyster-Plant Croquettes — Wash, scrape and boil one bunch of 
oyster plant until tender, rub through a colander, mix into a 
smooth paste with a tablespoonful of butter, one of cream, salt- 
spoonful of salt, half the quantity of pepper, and a teaspoonful of 
lemon juice. When the paste is cold, form into small rolls, dip 
in beaten egg and grated bread crumbs and fry in hot fat till crisp 
and brown. 

Easter Trifles — This dainty dish is not only delicious to eat, 
but charming to look at, representing a nest with Easter eggs. 
Soak a half-box of Knox's gelatine in a half-cup of cold water 
a half-hour. Boil two cups of milk and add to the gelatine, with 
two level tablespoonfuls of sugar and a teaspoonful of vanilla. 
Allow it to cool until it thickens, then add a cup of cream, 
whipped very stiff. Wash six eggs, make a hole inside of shell 
near the large end, pour out the whites into a bowl, break up 
the yolks with a skewer and pour into another bowl ready to be 
used for cake. Wash inside of shells clean and drain them, set 
them with the hole up in a box of salt (or anything that will hold 
them level), pour the blanc-mange in slowly through a funnel 
and set in a cold place to harden. Soak the other half-box of 
gelatine together with half the package of rose coloring matter 
found in each box in a half-cup of cold water five minutes; add 
a cup of sugar and pour over gelatine and sugar a cup of boiling 
water, add the juice of two lemons with sufficient water to make 
a cup of liquid. When cool (not cold) pour into a round glass 
dish with a coffee cup inverted in center, set away to harden. 
When ready to serve remove the coffee cup, place small strips 
of candied lemon peel on sides and top of the jelly nest to rep- 
resent straws, then break the egg shells carefully and place eggs 
in the nest, adding a flake of whipped cream here and there to 
simulate feathers. 

Salmon Salad — Remove skin, oil and bones carefully from a 
half can of salmon; squeeze over it juice of small lemon and set 
away to get thoroughly chilled. When ready to serve add as 
much coarsely cut celery as fish, a dozen English walnut meats 
broken in small pieces, three small cucumber pickles finely cut 
and a half dozen olives cut in pieces. Pour over a home-made 
salad dressing and mix with silver fork, breaking salmon as little 
as possible. 

Easter Cake — Cream together one cup of sugar and a half cup 
of butter, add yolks of four eggs and a half cup of milk. Then 
stir in gradually two and a half cups of flour sifted with two

teaspoonfiils of baking powder. Add a teaspoonful of lemon juice 
and stir in lightly the whites of four eggs beaten very stiff. Bake 
in four layers and fill with the following: The grated rind of one 
and the juice of two lemons, one cupful of sugar, one egg, one- 
half cupful of water, one teaspoonful of butter and a heaping 
tablespoonful of flour cooked over hot water till it thickens; cool 
before spreading. Ice the top with boiled frosting and decorate 
with rings of candied cherries, alternating with seeded raisins and 
small pieces of citron. Mrs. G. A. Chapman.

fine. Take a good-sized slice of bacon (about two ounces), cut 
into small squares and fry them a crisp and golden brown. Add 
to this one-half cup of good cider vinegar and pour immediately 
over the other ingredients. Mix with a salad fork and spoon 
lightly to prevent breaking the potatoes. Three tablespoons of 
olive oil may be substituted for bacon if preferred. This salad 
may be served warm or cold. Put one pound of Frankfurt sau- 
sages in stew pan, add sufficient boiling water to cover them, boil 
briskly five minutes. Put potato salad on a platter and arrange

cold water and stir it in; let boil until clear and serve at once. 

Browned Mashed Potatoes — Peel and boil six large potatoes in 
"salted water; when done mash them fine, add butter size of a

cups of sifted flour, one teaspoon of salt, one even teaspoon of bak- 
ing soda should be sifted into the flour; last of all, add one-half 
cup seedless raisins, one-half cup currants or any preferred dried 
fruit; steam three hours. This is an infallible recipe, sufficient 
for two meals at least. Will keep as long as you desire. Can 
be steamed over and be as good as fresh on short notice.

Serve foam sauce. 

Turk's Cap— Mix one pint of rich milk with seven well-beaten 
eggs, half a pound of fiour and half a teaspoonful of salt. Bake 
in a cake tin and serve quickly. 

Haricot Soup — Trim and fry to a light brown five mutton 
cutlets. Pour over them three quarts of water and stew until 
tender. Chop one carrot, one onion, one stalk of celery, and add 
(after the stock has been strained) with one cup of sauce universal. 
Cook until tender, then thicken with two tablespoonfuls of 
browned flour mixed with one of butter; add a teaspoonful of salt. 

Sauce Universal — One pint of mushroom catsup, one teaspoon- 
ful each of vinegar, black pepper, allspice and one minced onion. 
Place in a jar in water, heat thoroughly. Let it stand twenty-four 
hours. After five days strain and bottle. It is a great addition 
to soups and gravies. 

Casserole of Mock Sweetbreads — One pound of uncooked lean 
veal cut into half-inch cubes. Boil with one slice of lemon and 
teaspoonful of salt in enough water to cover well. When tender 
throw into cold water to whiten. Take one cup of white sauce, a 
saltspoonful each of salt, celery salt and half the quantity of 
pepper, with half a cup of mushrooms cut into quarters. Stir into 
the veal with white sauce. Heat over hot water five minutes, or 
until all are hot. Add quickly a teaspoonful of lemon juice and 
one well-beaten egg. Serve inside a border of mashed potatoes. 

Oyster Plant — Scrape two bunches of the plants, cover with 
cold water and a gill of vinegar to prevent them turning black. 
Cut into thin slices across and cook in salted boiling water until 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 173 

tender. Drain and pour over enough white sauce to a little more 
than cover them. 

Delicate Dish — Beat the whites of six eggs with two table- 
spoonfuls of currant jelly to a solid froth so that it will not fall. 
Serve with powdered sugar and cream. Mrs. P. B. Gehr.

MONDAY, APRIL THE NINETEENTH. 



BREAKFAST. 
Orange marmalade. 
Stewed sheep's tongues. Chopped potatoes. 
Oatmeal bannocks. Coffee. 



LUNCHEON. 

Rissoles. 

Boston brown bread. Radishes. 

Chocolate fruit cookies. Milled cocoa. 



DINNER. 

Egg dumpling soup. 

Beef a la mode. Mashed potatoes. 

Macaroni (special). Spring onions. 

Surprise dessert. Fudges. 

Black coffee. 



Orange Marmalade — Peel four dozen oranges, quarter and take 
out the seeds and inner skins as much as possible. Soak the peel- 
ing over night in water to cover with a half-cup of salt dissolved 
in it. In the morning boll the peeling in clear water until quite 
tender, then chop very fine and add the juice and pulp. Weigh 
and add equal quantity of white sugar. Let come slowly to a boil 
and let boil half an hour, stirring with great care. Should be 
quite clear and transparent. Put up in pint glass jars or jelly 
tumblers. If in the latter, have cut ready rounds of close but not 
stiff paper a little larger than tops of glasses. Draw one side of 
each round of paper over the white of an egg which has been 
placed, unbeaten, upon a shallow saucer; see that the side is 
wholly wet with the egg, then press it over the jelly glass firmly 
and evenly, holding it a second so the white of egg will adhere 
to the glass. This should be done as soon as the glass is filled 
w^ith the hot marmalade or jelly, as the heat quickly cooks the 
white of egg and forms a perfectly air-tight covering. For twelve 
years I have used this method of sealing jams and jellies, and can 
truly say that I have not lost a single glass or had the slightest 



174 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

mold form upon the top. It is quickly and neatly done and 
economical, for the old way of putting an inner round of paper, 
wet with brandy, flat upon the jelly caused waste of the jelly, 
which adhered, to say nothing of the additional trouble. The 
same objection holds good against the melting of paraffin. 

Stewed Sheep's Tongues — Parboil four or five sheep's tongues 
in salted water until they can be skinned. Trim neatly and cut 
lengthwise into four pieces. Put for each tongue a tablespoonful 
of chopped pork and a teaspoonful of minced parsley into a sauce- 
pan; put the split tongue upon this bed. Sprinkle with a salt- 
spoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper, the juice of half a 
lemon, and pour over all a cupful of stock or cold water and stew 
gently until tender. Thicken with a teaspoonful of cornstarch 
roux, boil up and serve. 

Cornstarch Roux — Place in a saucepan a half-pound of butter; 
when hot stir in half a pound of cornstarch, stir until brown but 
not scorched, let cool and bottle for handy use for thickening 
giavies or soups. 

Oatmeal Bannocks — Sift three cups of oatmeal, one cup of 
flour and a teaspoonful of salt well together. Boil one pint of 
milk and melt two tablespoonfuls of butter in it. Make a hole 
in the middle of the sifted meal and flour and pour the milk in; 
stir into a soft dough as quickly as possible, roll into a thin sheet, 
cut into round cakes and bake on a hot griddle; butter while hot 
and serve. Good cold. 

Rissoles — Roll out good pie crust, cut in square pieces as for 
turnovers; upon half of each square put a tablespoonful of flnely 
minced cold veal, chicken or calves' liver (which has been sea- 
soned with half a teaspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonful of pepper 
and a dusting of red pepper to each pint of meat), brush the edges 
of the paste with white of egg, fold over the other half and pinch 
the edges firmly together; bake in a quick oven, and when brown 
wash over with the beaten white, close the oven door a minute to 
glaze and serve hot. 

Boston Brown Bread — Two and a half cups of cornmeal, two 
cups of ryemeal, one cup of flour, one cup of molasses, two cups 
of milk, three teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one teaspoonful of 
salt. Scald the Indian meal with two cups of boiling water. Mix 
well and steam three hours, then place in a moderate oven for 
twenty minutes. 

Chocolate Fruit Cookies — Cream one-half cup of butter and 
one cup of sugar gradually; mix two tablespoonfuls of grated 
chocolate with one tablespoonful of sugar (taken from the cupful) 
and dissolve in one tablespoonful of hot water; hold over hot flre 
if it does not get smooth readily; add to butter, and sugar; stir in 
two well-beaten eggs; sift together two cupfuls of flour and one 
teaspoonful of baking powder; add to the mixture with half a cup 
of stoned and chopped raisins; if not stiff enough to roll out, add 
more flour; roll one-quarter inch in thickness, cut out and bake 
about ten minutes. 

Milled Cocoa— Let one quart of milk just come to a boil; mix 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 175 

three tablespoonfuls cocoa, two tablespoonfuls of sugar and a little 
pinch of salt together; pour slowly upon this mixture one cupful 
of boiling water; stir this into the scalded milk and mill or beat it 
with an egg-beater over the fire for two minutes. 

Egg Dumpling Soup — Into a quart or three pints of good stock 
drop from a spoon dumplings made according to this rule: Beat 
well two eggs, a very small teacup of flour and a larger cup of 
milk; melt in a spider half a cup of butter; when hot stir in the 
batter and cook, stirring constantly, until it leaves the side of 
the spider; set aside to cool; when cold beat in, separately, two 
eggs. 

Beef a la Mode — Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a deep 
stewpan; when it melts put in a large onion, cut fine, a small 
carrot and half a small turnip, also cut fine; cook these for five 
minutes. Have three or four pounds of the upper part of the 
round of beef and a third of a pound of fat salt pork. Cut the pork 
in strips as long as the meat is thick and draw these strips through 
the beef with a larding needle, or push the strips through holes 
made with the steel if you have not the needle. Put the meat 
so prepared in the vegetables and butter, first dredging the meat 
with flour, and brown on both sides. Add a quart and a half of 
boiling water, a tablespoonfui of vinegar, one of lemon juice, 
a quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, a clove, three allspice, an 
inch of stick cinnamon, a bay leaf and a pinch of sage and thyme. 
Cover tightly and just simmer for about three hours. Take up 
the meat, skim off the fat, stir in two tablespoonfuls of the corn- 
starch roux; boil rapidly for a few minutes; strain the gravy over 
the beef and serve. Enough for luncheon also. 

Macaroni (special) — Break twelve sticks of macaroni into two- 
inch pieces and cook in rapidly boiling salted water for twenty 
minutes; turn out into colander and pour cold water through to 
prevent its "clogging." Melt one tablespoon of butter; stir into 
it one tablespoon of flour, half a teaspoon of salt and one-quarter 
saltspoon of pepper. Pour on this gradually one and a half cups 
of boiling milk. Mix sauce with macaroni; grate one cup of cheese 
and mix half of it with the macaroni. Put the latter in a greased 
baking dish and cover, with half a cup of bread crumbs mixed 
v/ith a large tablespoon of melted butter and the rest of the cheese. 
Bake until brown. 

Surprise Dessert — Place upon a pretty flat dish halves of pre- 
served or canned peaches, the round side up. Around these pile 
whipped cream, sweetened and flavored with vanilla. An exact 
imitation of a dish of poached eggs and very delicious to the 
palate. 

Pudges — A chafing-dish recipe, but can be made over stove 
as well. Four cups of granulated sugar, one cup of rich milk, one- 
quarter pound of butter, one-half cake of Baker's chocolate grated. 
Put all over hot fire until it begins to thicken, stirring constantly. 
Place pan in another of hot water and cook until it is easily 
formed into a ball when dropped into cold v/ater; must not be 
hard or brittle, however. Remove from fire at this stage and stir 



176 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

until the mass begins to set. Pour in pan to depth of half an inch 
and mark off in squares. Add a few drops of vanilla when re- 
moved from fire if liked. Mrs. S. W. Manney.

just to cover, over night; in the morning cover with fresh water, 
and let it heat slowly, but never come to a boil. When fresh 
enough, drain, pick, and heat in a pint of cream sauce. Meantime 
cover one egg for each person with boiling water, and place where 
they will keep hot, but not boil, for ten minutes; pour off the hot 
water, turn on the cold, and remove the shells. Put the fish and 
sauce on a hot dish, lay the eggs on, garnish each with sprigs of 
parsley, or sprinkle a little minced parsley on the whole. 

Oysters on Crackers — Split as many crackers as desired, and 
spread generously with butter. Lay on each half cracker as many

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 177 

in the stock pot with salt and soup vegetables until tender, which 
will be about one hour and a half. Skin and put on a dish, gar- 
nishing with a pint of hot Milanaise rice, made as follows: Chop 
fine a good-sized onion, and fry in butter until a golden color; 
then add a cupful of rice, and half a dozen minced mushrooms; 
stir for two minutes, and add one quart of boiling broth; stir light- 
ly once, cook fifteen minutes, and add more broth at intervals as

season with one teaspoon of salt, and one-half teaspoon of pepper, 
add half a cup of grated Swiss cheese. Serve. 

Cake Roly-Poly — Make a plain sponge cake by sifting a tea- 
spoonful of baking powder with one cup of flour; beat the yolks 
of three eggs with one cupful of sugar, add the juice of one lemon 
and half the grated rind, then the whites whipped to a stiff froth, 
and lastly the flour. Spread this over a large flat buttered tin and 
bake in a slow oven. Turn out on a towel, spread v/ith marmalade, 
sweetmeats or any kind of stewed fruit; trim off the crusty edges 
and roll up. Serve with a hot sauce, or with whipped cream or 
with plain cream sweetened. Mrs. C. J. Kuehne.

put them on to stew in the water they were soaked in; add the 
rind of a lemon cut into small thin strips, and let them stew gently 
till tender. Add one teacupful of sugar just before they are done; 
they will take about thirty minutes to stew. The addition of the 
lemon rind is a great improvement. One pound will make two 
nice dishes, fully enough for two mornings. 



178 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

• 

Tapioca Milk — Soak three tablespoonfuls of pearl tapioca in 
cold water over night; in the morning put on to cook in double 
boiler; add one-half teaspoonful of salt, three cups of boiling 
milk, one-half cup of sugar; let it cook thirty minutes. 

Potato Puffs — Melt two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter in 
one-half cup of milk; stir it into a pint of hot, mashed potatoes 
with an even teaspoonful of salt and one-quarter teaspoonful of 
pepper; two eggs, well beaten; sift in enough flour to make a 
dough, which can be rolled out and cut in thin biscuits; bake them 
in a moderate oven about forty minutes; serve hot with butter. 

Hot Scones — One quart of sifted flour, one-half pint of butter- 
milk, one tablespoon of butter, one tablespoon of sugar, one-half 
teaspoon of baking soda, one-half teaspoonful of salt; rub the but- 
ter into the flour, add the sugar and salt, stir the soda into the 
buttermilk, and mix into the flour, making a smooth paste, then 
roll it out to a thin sheet and cut it into triangular pieces, flour a 
tin and put the scones on and bake them directly from thirty to 
forty minutes, just before they are done take them out and brush 
over with milk, put back in oven to glaze. (These are good either 
hot or cold.) 

Fruit Jelly — Cut four bananas lengthwise, pare and slice three 
oranges, dissolve one-half box of Nelson's gelatine in one-half pint 
of cold water; then add one pint of boiling water, the juice of one 
lemon, one small cup of sugar, pour this jelly over the fruit and 
set it away to cool. 

Carrot Soup a la Cressy — Six carrots, two onions, one head of 
celery, or one teaspoon of celery seed, four ounces of raw ham, 
two ounces of butter, three pints of stock or water, one gill of 
cream, one-half teaspoon of sugar, one saltspoon of salt, one-quar- 
ter teaspoon of pepper. Peel off the red part of the carrots and put 
it into a stew-pan with the onions sliced, the celery or seed and the 
ham cut up, add two ounces of butter; put the lid on close and 
simmer over the fire gently for ten minutes, then add three pints 
of stock or water and simmer till the vegetables are tender (which 
will be in about three-fourths of an hour), drain off the stock, 
pound the carrots and the other ingredients to a pulp, add the 
stock they were cooked in and press all through a fine sieve; re- 
turn this puree to the stev/pan and stir it over the fire till it boils; 
let it boil gently for a quarter of an hour, add the cream, sugar, 
pepper and salt, serve with fried croutons, handed separately. 
(This will be enough for two meals, and will be found just as good 
made hot in double boiler for second day.) 

Rolled Loin of Mutton — About four or five pounds of loin 
of mutton, trim off the fat and take out the bones, which is soon 
done if one has a sharp knife (or the butcher will always do it for 
his customers), put the bones on to stew with one pint and a 
half of water, make a dressing with a quarter of a pound of bread 
crumbs, two ounces of chopped suet, one teaspoonful each of 
chcpiied parsley, thyme, summer savory, onion and lemon peel, 
one teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of pepper. Mix into 
a paste with one egg and just a little milk (about two tablespoon- 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 179 

fuls will be enough). Spread this dressing all over the loin of mut- 
ton and roll it up tight, sew it and place it in the roasting pan, 
bake in not too hot an oven for about one hour and a quarter; lift 
it out onto a hot dish, pour off the dripping out of the pan and 
pour in the gravy from the bones; set it on top of the stove to 
heat and brown; pour over the mutton and serve with red currant 
jelly. (This makes an excellent roast, and is very good either 
made hot in some of its own gravy or eaten cold v/ith salad for 
second day.) 

Smothered Cabbage — Cut a small head of cabbage fine and put 
it in a pan where meat has been fried; pour on one-half cup of 
sweet milk, season with one teaspoon of salt, one-half teaspoon of 
pepper, and butter about the size of an egg; cover it lightly and 
let it stand on the back of the stove fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Sweet Potatoes a la Province — Slice four raw sweet potatoes 
thin and lay in a dish with bits of butter; sprinkle with one- 
half teaspoon of salt and one-quarter teaspoon of pepper; pour 
over milk to cover; wet one large tablespoon of bread crumbs in 
milk; add a beaten egg; pour over the top; set in the oven and 
bake one-half hour. 

Rice Meringue — Boil one cup of rice in a quart of water until 
tender; drain in a colander; add one pint of milk, a tablespoon 
of butter and the yolks of four eggs beaten with one-half cup of 
sugar and the juice and grated rind of a lemon; pour in a baking 
dish and bake in a quick oven; beat the whites of the eggs with 
one-half teacup of powdered sugar and heap over the top; set in 
the oven to brown. Mrs. H. Ross Edwards.

180 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Rye Bread — Two pounds rye flour, three half-pint cups luke- 
warm water, a little wheat-bread dough, one heaping teaspoonful 
salt, one-half teaspoonful caraway seed. Make a sponge of one- 
half the flour, the dough and water. Let it raise three or four 
hours and then add the salt, caraway seed and remainder of flour. 
Mix and stir thoroughly with a wooden spoon. Allow it to raise 
to double its size and bake about thirty-five minutes in an oven 
heated just enough to be able to hold the hand in it till you count 
twenty. 

Brains — One and a half pounds brains, half tablespoonful of 
butter, three tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, two eggs, a little 
parsley and level teaspoonful salt; place brains in cold water for 
a quarter of an hour; drain and pour boiling water over them; 
take out and pull off the skins; chop fine; add the butter, bread 
crumbs, eggs, parsley chopped and salt; mix well and bake. 

Stewed Prunes — One pound prunes, grated rind of lemon, a 
little cinnamon and allspice, three tablespoonfuls sugar; wash 
the prunes, put into a stewpan with the spices and sugar; cover 
well with cold water; cover the stewpan and boil till soft; serve 
warm or cold. 

Yolk Rings — Four eggs, one-eighth pound butter, one-fourth 
pound sugar, a little mace and grated lemon peel, and scant pint 
flour. Boil the eggs hard; take out yolks and rub into the butter. 
Add the sugar, mace and lemon rind and stir, adding the flour. 
Roll out, cut in round cakes, make a hole in the center of each. 
Strew with sugar and bake. 

Brown Farina Soup — Two quarts water, one onion, one small 
carrot cut in pieces, a little parsley and celery, one egg, about 
three tablespoonfuls farina, one heaping teaspoonful salt and the 
bones cut from the veal. Put bones into the cold water, bring to 
a boil and skim. Add the onion, carrot, parsley, celery and salt. 
Boil till reduced to three pints. Strain and cool. Beat the egg, 
add a little salt; pour in farina gradually, stirring constantly, till 
of cake-dough consistency. Drop the farina from a teaspoon into 
frying-pan in which a lump of butter, size of a hickory nut, has 
been heating. When browned on both sides, drop the farina 
balls into the soup. Allow it to stand fifteen minutes, then boil 
another fifteen minutes, and finally pour in the farina, which has 
been browned in the butter left in the frying-pan, cooled and 
mixed with a little lukewarm water, so as not to form lumps. 
Boil up and serve. 

Chopped Veal Leg— One and a half pounds chopped veal off 
the leg, one cup bread crumbs, one-eighth pound chopped suet, two 
eggs, one rounding teaspoonful salt, one lemon and a pinch of 
mace. Have the butcher chop the veal fine and give you the bones 
he has taken out. Use them for soup. Mix the veal, bread crumbs, 
suet, eggs, salt, juice of half the lemon and mace all together 
thoroughly. Wet hands in cold water and shape like veal leg; 
put into a greased dripping-pan; pour a cup hot water around 
the meat; cover with a larger dripping-pan. Bake one hour in 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 181 

steady oven. Take off the pan, brown the top, and, just before 
serving, pour over the juice of the other half of the lemon. 

Rice — Wash thoroughly one-quarter pound rice. Put into plenty 
of boiling salted water. When soft drain in colander. Pour over 
it some cold water; drain. Add a bit of butter, a dash of pepper; 
mix carefully and place in open oven on a warm platter a little 
while. 

Noodle Pudding — One egg, scant cup of flour, one-eighth tea- 
spoonful salt. Sift the flour and salt. Into the center break the 
egg. Mix flour into egg with a knife and make a stiff dough, 
but still capable of being rolled out. Work it with the hands till 
pliable. Roll out into a thin sheet. Cut in long, narrow strips, 
placing one over the other, then with a sharp knife cut across into 
fine strands. Boil two minutes in boiling salted water. Drain. 
Cream one teaspoonful butter with one tablespoonful sugar and a 
few blanched and chopped almonds. Rub into the noodles. Pour 
over all a small cup of sweet cream. Mix. Place in a dish, earthen- 
ware preferred, strew with bits of butter and bake in moderate 
oven till brown. Eat with cinnamon and sugar. 

Stuffed Biscuits (Bohemian kolace) — Into one pound of flour 
put a cent's worth of yeast, prepared, one egg, one tablespoon but- 
ter or lard, one scant pint of lukewarm milk, one level teaspoon- 
ful salt. Mix thoroughly with wooden spoon, working the dough 
till smooth. Set in warm place to raise and cover it. When raised 
put on a floured kneading board. Roll out to about halt an inch 
in thickness, cut in circular shape, place in greased dripping-pan 
without touching. Rub over with butter or lard (melted). Take 
out pits from prunes left over from luncheon. Chop the prunes 
and put a little of the jam on the center of each biscuit. Let 
raise again and bake to a light brown. To prepare the yeast 
crumble it into a cup with one tablespoonful sugar and one quar- 
ter cup warm milk. Mix and use as soon as it rises.

FRIDAY, APRIL THE TWENTY-THIRD. 



BREAKFAST. 

Hazel oats, sugar, milk. 

Lamb cutlets. Minced potato. 

White bread. Brown bread. 

Cereal Winsor coffee. 



LUNCHEON. 

Shrimp salad mayonnaise. 

Graham crackers. 

Pieplant meringue pie. 



182 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

DINNER. 

Cream tomato soup. 

Broiled pompano, tartare sauce. 

Potatoes in form. 

Lettuce with salad dressing. 

Bread and butter. 

Kuchen with coffee. 



Lamb Cutlets— Only the "rack" can be used in this way. Take 
it home and cut the chops yourself, few butchers will cut them 
rightly. First cut and chop off all the backbone at once. Chop 
oft" all the ends of the ribs so that the cutlets shall be of the same 
length. Then cut through, leaving two rib-bones in each chop; 
carefully cut out one bone and trim and scrape the other clean 
for about one inch from its end. Flatten the cutlets and trim off 
all ragged edges. About one-half hour before breakfast time take 
the ashes out of the ash-pan and put in a bed of charcoal. Place 
upon this a few live coals, and cover with something so as to 
cause a good draft. Have always ready a little, flat, tin-bound 
brush in a tin cup with either drippings or melted butter in it. 
Lay the meat on a plate and slightly brush over on both sides 
with the butter. Then place it on a wire broiler and cook quickly. 
Lamb cutlets will cook in about the same time that an egg will 
boil soft (never stick a fork into broiling meat). Cut as many 
thin pear-shaped slices of bread as there are cutlets — one for 
each person is generally sufficient— toast and butter them and set 
them on end alternately with the cutlets, one toast and one cut- 
let, on a hot dish, and serve without sauce, except table sauces and 
pickles. This dish is well worth the trouble of preparing. 

Minced Potato — Chop cold boiled potatoes small and season 
wHh salt. Spread a spoonful of drippings or butter in a frying 
pan and place the potatoes in about an inch deep. Cook on top 
of the range without stirring. Cover with an inverted plate and 
let them brown nicely and slowly. Then turn over onto the plate, 
set in another plate and serve with the brown side up. 

Shrimp Salad Mayonnaise — Shred one large head of lettuce as 
fine as possible with a sharp knife on a board; rinse a can of 
shrimps in cold water; put them in a bowl with two tablespoon- 
fuls of olive oil and the same of vinegar and shake about to make 
them look shiny and moist; cover a flat dish with lettuce. Pile 
the shrimps neatly in the middle and spread over the top, so as not 
to hide the shrimps, some mayonnaise or salad dressing. Shrimps 
that are so shaken will generally keep their shape if pressed a 
little in a deep dish, and can then be turned out upon the lettuce in 
form. 

Pieplant Meringue Pie — Either fresh or canned pieplant may 
be used for this. Take enough stewed pieplant for one pie — about 
half a pint — and stir into it while boiling a heaping teaspoonful 
of cornstarch mixed with the yolks of two eggs and a cup of sugar 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 183 

and one tablespoonful of butter; have ready a pie tin lined with 
a nice crust already baked. Spread this with the pieplant mixture 
and cover with a meringue made of the whites of the eggs, beaten 
stiff, with two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Set in the oven until 
nicely browned and serve cold. Delicious. 

Broiled Pompano — Scrape the skin thoroughly. The small 
ones, weighing a pound or so, may be broiled whole; the large 
ones should be split down the back and through the head. Broil 
the cut side first — eight or ten minutes — brush over with butter 
and dredge with salt and pepper, then broil the skin side until 
done. Serve on a hot dish with tartare sauce poured around. 

Tartare Sauce — Boil a teaspoonful of minced onion in a quar- 
ter cupful of vinegar a few minutes, throw in a cookingspoonful 
of butter, add the yolks of four eggs, beaten, and cook about a 
minute longer. When it thickens take it from the fire and add 
gradually a cookingspoonful of olive oil, a teaspoonful of salt, a 
pinch of cayenne and a little minced cucumber or gherkin pickle 
(this latter is not necessary but an improvement). Serve very hot 
with fish, or in a gravy boat if preferred. 

Kuchen — Make a sponge as for bread of flour wet with one 
pint of lukewarm milk, salt and one cake compressed yeast and 
set in a warm place to rise. If for lunch rise over night, but for 
dinner it m.ay be mixed in the morning. When light add three 
eggs, one cup sugar, one cup butter or half as much cottolene, 
one cup seeded raisins, flour enough to mold up like bread. Let 
rise again and press out into a cake to fill a dripping pan; spread 
with butter and cover with sliced apples. Sprinkle with sugar 
and cinnamon and bake as 3^ou would bread. Serve hot or cold, 
with after-dinner coffee. This quantity will serve for several 
meals and is nice for lunch, as it will not dry in many days.

Steamed Macaroni— Boil one-half package of macaroni until 
tender. Throw into a colander and drain. Beat three eggs' until 
light, add one tablespoon butter, one-half cup milk or stock, flavor 
with one even teaspoon salt, a little pepper and about one-half 
teaspoonful of finely chopped onion. Butter the double-boiler 
and sprinkle with cracker crumbs. Place the macaroni into the 
egg mixture and then pour all into the double-boiler, sprinkling 
the top with cracker crumbs and small bits of butter. Tie the 
cover of the boiler down firmly with string and allow it to steam 
for one hour and a half, then invert the boiler and serve with 
tomato sauce. 

Tomato Sauce — Rub one tablespoon of butter and one tea- 
spoon of cornstarch together in a spider and add slowly the juice 
of one-half can of tomatoes. Season with a large saltspoon of 
salt, saltspoon sugar and a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper. 

Tongue Fricassee — Wash a fresh beef tongue thoroughly in two 
or three waters. Trim, and tie into shape. Cover with boiling 
water and season with two teaspoonfuls of salt, twelve pepper- 
corns and one small onion. The tongue should be boiled and 
skinned the day before. Skin while still hot. 

Gravy — Throw one tablespoon of flour into a hot dry spider. 
Allow it to become a rich brown. Rub in a piece of butter the 
size of a small egg and slowly add the strained liquor of the 
tongue. Season this gravy with one saltspoon salt, one saltspoon 
sugar, and one tablespoon catsup. Throw in the sliced tongue and 
let all boil for about five minutes, when it is ready to serve. 

Hopple Popple — Grate the rind of one lemon and squeeze out 
the juice. Add one teaspoon best vanilla, one coffeecup sifted 
powdered sugar, two whole eggs and the yolks of seven others. 
Beat all this together for twenty minutes with a Dover beater. 
If another beater is used it must be beaten thirty minutes. Have 
one-half box Cox's gelatine dissolved in one cup of water. Add 
the well beaten whites of the seven yolks and at last, drop by 
drop, the gelatine beating all the while. Drop the mixture into a 
glass dish and set in a cool place. Serve with the juice of any 
preserved fruit or the sweetened juice of oranges. It is very de- 
licious and not at all expensive when eggs are cheap.

Omelet with Parsley — Five eggs beaten well separately, one- 
half teaspoon of salt, one saltspoon white pepper, one teaspoon 
flour, one tablespoon chopped parsley, turn the well-beaten mix- 
ture into a hot skillet containing one large teaspoon of butter, 
cook until set, fold together and serve on a hot dish covered with a 
folded napkin. 

Dried Beef Scrambled — Sizzle one-half pound of chipped dried 
beef in one tablespoon of butter, add two eggs well beaten, scram- 
ble all together, serve hot. 

Beaten Biscuit — Sift one teaspoon of salt with one quart of 
flour. Add one tablespoon of lard. Part milk and part ice water 
to make a stiff dough. Beat and work until of a velvety smooth- 
ness and beginning to blister, at least a half hour. Roll to one- 
half inch thickness. Cut with small cutter. Bake in moderately 
quick oven. Prick well vnth fork before baking. 

Lettuce Salad — In buying choose firm, crisp heads of lettuce. 
Let lie in running water for one hour, then wash well in ice water. 
This will insure its crispness. Wipe carefully and thoroughly in 
a napkin. To one head of lettuce the rule is two tablespoons of 
olive oil, one-half tablespoonful of vinegar, one-half teaspoonful 
of salt, a dash of cayenne pepper. Rub the salad bowl with a 
split clove or garlic or bit of onion; add oil; dissolve salt and pep- 
per in vinegar, add to oil, mix well, turn the lettuce into bowl, 
toss well and serve. 

Cream of Asparagus Soup — All good soups take stock, which 



186 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

should be made every week from scraps and bones and kept in 
the ice chest. Put two ounces of butter into a sauce-pan, add 
three tablespoons of flour, stir well and add three pints of un- 
salted soup stock, previously warmed. Put into this one-half 
bunch of asparagus, twelve whole black peppers, a teaspoon of 
salt, two cloves, a sprig of thyme and one of parsley. Boil thirty 
minutes. Strain and add a tablespoon of cream. Delicious and in- 
expensive. The hard ends of asparagus may be used, v/hich have 
been trimmed from the bunch the day before, as well as any cold 
left-over asparagus. 

Croutons — Butter slices of bread, cut rather thick. Cut off 
the crusts, cut into small blocks and place in the oven until a 
golden brown. Use up scraps of bread in this v/ay. 

Boiled Leg of Mutton — Take a medium-sized leg of mutton, 
cut off the shank bone; trim well. Plunge into a pot of boiling 
water, sufficient to cover it. Add one-half tablespoon salt, twelve 
whole black peppers, a bit of red pepper, six cloves, one large 
onion, a sprig of thyme and parsley. Boil one hour and a quarter. 
There will be sufficient left for a lunch (cold) and a breakfast 
hashed with potatoes. Very delicate. 

Egg Sauce — Stir two tablespoons of flour into one of butter, 
melted. Moisten with one and a half pints of the "mutton broth" 
(previously strained). Let boil well. Have the yolks of two 
hard-boiled eggs well mashed and moistened with a little of the 
broth. Add slowly; then add the chopped whites and a tablespoon 
of lemon juice. Garnish the mutton with a portion of the sauce, 
send the rest to the table in the gravy dish. 

Meringues — Beat the whites of six eggs eight minutes with a 
scant saltspoon of salt. Gradually add one pound of powdered 
sugar, mixing slowly. Add one teaspoon of vanilla. Line a large 
pan with brown paper. Do not grease it. Drop the mixture in egg 
shapes about two and one-half inches long by one inch wide and 
one inch apart. Sprinkle liberally with powdered sugar. Bake in 
a slow oven thirty minutes. When cold wet the wrong side of 
the paper and the meringues will detach easily. With finger press 
the inside into perfect egg shape. Serve with cream. This will 
make eighteen shells — enough for two meals.

Minced spinach. 

Sponge drops. Fruit glace. 

Coffee. 



Quaker Omelet — Three eggs, half a cupful of milk, one and a 
half tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, one-half teaspoonful of salt, 
one tablespoonful of butter. Put the omelet pan and a cover that 
will fit closely on to heat. Beat well together the yolks of the 
eggs, the cornstarch and the salt. Beat the whites to a stiff froth. 
Add to the well-beaten yolks and cornstarch, stir all together 
very thoroughly and add the milk. Put the butter in the hot pan. 
When melted pour in the mixture. Cover and place on the stove, 
where it will brov/n but not burn. Cook about seven minutes, 
fold, turn on a hot dish and serve with cream sauce poured around 
it. 

Cream Sauce — One cupful of milk, a teaspoonful of flour and 
a tablespoonful of butter, one-quarter of a teaspoon of salt and 
one-quarter of that amount of pepper. Put the butter in a small 
frying pan, and, when hot but not brown, add the flour. Stir 
until smooth, then gradually add the milk. Let it boil up once. 
Season with the salt and pepper and serve. 

English Muffins — One quart of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, 
one-third of a cake of compressed yeast, one cupful and a half 
of water. Have the water blood-warm. Dissolve the yeast in one- 
third of a cupful of cold water. Add it and the salt to the warm 
water, and gradually stir into the flour. Beat the dough thor- 
oughly; cover and let it rise in a warm place over night. In the 
morning flour the board well, shape the dough into balls about 
twice the size of an egg, and drop them on the floured board. 
When all the dough has been shaped roll the balls into cakes about 
one-third of an inch thick. Lay these on a warm griddle which 
has been lightly greased and put the griddle on the back of the 
stove where there is not much heat. When they have risen a 
little draw the griddle forward and cook them slowly, turning 
often to keep the flat shape. It will take about twenty minutes for 
them to rise on the griddle and fifteen to cook. Tear them apart, 
butter and serve. 

Cold Boiled Fish a la Vinaigrette — Take the remains of any 
cold fish, baked or boiled, pick free from skin and bone, heap light- 
ly in the center of a dish; sprinkle vinaigrette sauce over it. Gar- 
nish with a border of lettuce leaves and cold-boiled eggs, cut in 
rings. 



188 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Vinaigrette Sauce — One teaspoonful of white pepper, one of 
salt, half a teaspoonful of mustard, half a cupful of vinegar, one 
tablespoonful of oil. Mix the salt, pepper and mustard together; 
then very slowly add the vinegar; after mixing well add the oil. 

Rhubarb Charlotte — Butter a baking dish thoroughly and 
cover the bottom an inch deep with fine bread crumbs, then with 
a layer of rhubarb that has been peeled and cut into thin, small 
pieces. Scatter thickly with sugar, cover with a second layer of 
crumbs; put bits of butter over each layer of crumbs. Continue to 
fill the dish thus to the top; the top layer should be crumbs. Bake 
in a slow oven for an hour. 

Ragout of Mutton — Three pounds of any of the cheap parts 
of mutton, six tablespoonfuls of butter, three of flour, one onion, 
one large white turnip cut into little cubes, a heaping teaspoonful 
of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper (these last two quantities 
may be increased or decreased, as taste requires), one quart of 
water and a bouquet of sweet herbs. Cut the meat in small pieces. 
Put three tablespoonfuls each of butter and flour in the stewpan, 
and when hot and smooth add the meat. Stir until a rich brown, 
and then add water and set where it will simmer. Put the rest of 
the butter in a frying-pan, and when hot put in the turnips and 
onions, with a teaspoonful of flour; stir all the time until a golden 
brown, then drain and put with the meat. Sinimer for an hour 
and a half. Serve very hot. 

To Make a Bouquet of Sweet Herbs — Put two sprigs of parsley 
on the table and across them lay two bay leaves, two sprigs of 
thyme, two of summer savory and two leaves of sage. Tie all 
these herbs (which are dry) with the parsley. 

Minced Spinach — Wash thoroughly and boil in a little water 
until tender. Drain in the colander and chop fine in the tray. 
Sprinkle well with one-quarter teaspoonful pepper and one- 
half teaspoonful salt. For each quart of chopped spinach put 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and one of flour in a frying-pan. 
When cooked smooth and before it becomes brown add the 
spinach; stir for flve minutes, then add half a cupful of milk 
and stir three minutes longer. Arrange on a hot dish in the 
shape of a mound. Garnish with a wreath of slices of hard- 
boiled eggs at the base, and finish the top v/ith another wreath. 
Serve hot. 

Fruit Glace — Boil together for half an hour one cupful of 
granulated sugar and one of water. Dip the point of a skewer 
in the sirup after it has been boiling the given time and then 
in water. If the thread formed breaks off brittle the sirup is done. 
Pare some oranges, divide them into eighths and wipe free of 
moisture. Pour part of the hot sirup into a cup, which keep in 
boiling water. Take the pieces of orange on the point of a large 
needle or skewer and dip them in the sirup. Place them on a 
dish that has been buttered lightly. Care must be taken not to 
stir the sirup, as that spoils it. Mrs. John Buie.

and preparing to thicken add one-quarter cup of powdered sugar, 
one-half teaspoonful of vanilla, and, lastly, half a cup of cream 
whipped to a stiff froth. Turn in a wet mold and set away to 
cool. Miss L, C. Hunger.

teaspoonful of salt and a little mace; dip in egg, then into cracker 
crumbs and fry in hot fat; they both look and taste like oysters. 

Quick Coffeecake— A delicious coffeecake is made by creaming 
one-fourth of a cup of butter with a cup of sugar; add one beaten 
egg, one-half cup of milk, a saltspoonful of salt and one and a 
half cups of flour sifted with one good teaspoonful of baking 
powder; bake in a flat tin, pouring the batter less than an inch 
thick: dot with bits of butter the size of a pea about an inch 
apart and sprinkle plentifully with sugar and cinnamon. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 191 

Chicken Omelet — Warm one cupful of cold chicken (one-half 
veal is just as good), minced fine, in a teacup of milk, a table- 
spoonful of butter, a quarter-teaspoonful salt and saitspoonful 
of pepper; thicken with a large tablespoonful of flour; make a 
plain omelet, then add this mixture just before turning it over. 

White Gingercakes — One cup of butter, two cups of sugar, one 
cup of sour milk, three eggs, one-half teaspoonful of soda dissolved 
in a tablespoonful of warm water, one tablespoonful of ginger, one 
teaspoonful of cinnamon, the grated rind and juice of an orange, 
and five cups of sifted flour, or enough to roll out soft. Cut rather 
thick like biscuit, bake in a quick ov^en and sprinkle with sugar 
while hot. 

Spring Vegetable Soup — Put in a saucepan with one pint of 
water two shredded lettuces, one onion, half a pint of green or 
canned peas, a small bunch of parsley, two tablespoonfuls of butter 
and simmer till tender. Season with a small teaspoonful salt and 
quarter-teaspoonful of pepper. When done drain off the vegeta- 
bles and add two-thirds of the liquor to one-quart of soup stock. 
Beat up the yolks of three eggs with the other third of the liquor 
vegetables were boiled in, toss it over the flre, and at the moment 
of serving add this with the vegetables. 

Whitefish a la creme — Rub the fish ^ell with salt and put 
it into a kettle with just sufficient warm water to cover it; as soon 
as it boils set it where it will simmer for an hour; then drain it 
and remove the large bones. Put one ounce of flour into a sauce- 
pan, to which add by degrees a quart of milk, mix very smooth, 
add one large onion sliced, a bunch of parsley, a little nutmeg, 
one teaspoonful salt, one-quarter teaspoonful pepper; place all 
over the fire and stir constantly till it becomes quite thick, then 
add a quarter of a pound of butter, pass through a sieve, pour the 
hot sauce over the fish, set in the oven and let it brown. The white 
of an egg v/ell beaten and spread over it will make it brown better. 
To prevent the china dish from breaking or discoloring place it 
in a pan of hot water before setting in the oven. Once tasted, 
never forgotten. 

Dainty Dessert— One quart of milk, the whites of four eggs 
beaten to a stiff froth, one heaping cupful of sifted fiour, one 
scant cupful of powdered sugar, add a little grated lemon peel and 
a saitspoonful salt, beat till very light, bake in gem pans, sift 
powdered sugar over them and serve with lemon sauce.

Fruit Salad — Remove peel and seeds from three oranges, 
and cut each section in several pieces. Slice two small bananas 
and cut two figs in tiny pieces. Mix lightly, adding two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar. 

Eggs on Zwieback — Break each egg on a well-buttered round 
of stale bread, season each with a pinch of salt. Set in a moder- 
ately hot oven until the bread is browned and the eggs are set. 
Serve hot. 

Potato Sticks — Cut four good-sized potatoes, that have beeh 
peeled and laid in cold water over night, into sticks about one- 
fourth of an inch square and an inch and a half long. Wipe per- 
fectly dry in a clean towel, drop in plenty of smoking hot fat "and 
fry a delicate brown. When done give them at once a thorough 
shaking in a large paper sack to remove any grease adhering; 
sprinkle with salt and pepper. Serve hot. 

Liver Patties — Chop cold stewed liver until quite fine. Add 
to a pint of liver a tablespoonful of butter (melted), half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pepper. Mix thoroughly. Put 
a heaping tablespoonful in each very thin tart shell and bake 
from fifteen to twenty minutes. Serve hot or cold. 

Cheese Pudding — One cupful each of grated or chopped cheese, 
bread crumbs and milk, one egg beaten, one teaspoonful of but- 
ter, one-half teaspoonful each of salt and mixed mustard, one salt- 
spoonful of pepper. Put cheese and bread crumbs in alternate 
layers in a buttered pudding dish, mix egg, milk and seasoning 
and pour over and bake until firm like custard, about fifteen min- 
utes. Serve hot. 

Rice Balls — Thoroughly mix a brimming tablespoonful of 
lemon juice with a pint of cold, boiled and well-drained rice. 
Press into tight balls the size of a walnut. Drop in hot fat until 
a golden brown. Drain on paper, dust with pulverized sugar and 
serve at once. Very delicate. 

Baked Beefsteak and Potatoes — Lay the steak in the center of 
the baking pan, the potatoes peeled and cut in half-inch slices 
around it. Put a bit of butter and a sprinkle of salt on each piece 
of potato, but do not salt the meat until done. If the steak is 
not sufficiently fat dot it with butter. A cheap steak will be found 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 193 

far more palatable cooked in this way. Tlie oven should not be too 
hot. 

Corn Drops — One can of corn, three eggs, a small teaspoonful 
of salt, a tablespoonful of sugar, a saltspoonful of pepper, a table- 
spoonful of flour and a lump of butter the size of an egg. Beat 
the eggs thoroughly, melt the butter and mix both with the other 
ingredients. Drop in well-buttered gem pan's and b'ake in a mod- 
erate oven half an hour. 

French Peas — Soak a pint of well-washed, dried peas in a 
quart of water six hours. Then add a small teaspoonful of salt, 
one teaspoonful of sugar, a teaspoonful of butter, and an onion 
the size of an English walnut, and let come quickly to a boil. Cover, 
remove to the back of the range, and simmer gently, so as not to 
break the peas, for an hour. This is an excellent way to cook 
green peas also, omitting of course the soaking and long boiling. 
The onion may be removed or served with them. 

Colonial Hats — One coffeecup of stoned and chopped raisins, 
the juice and grated rind of one lemon, one egg, one cup of sugar, 
a pinch of salt, and, if liked, a piece of citron the size of half a 
dollar. Mix all well. Put tablespoonfuls of this mixture on 
rounds of piecrust from six to seven inches in diameter and very 
thinly rolled. Fold together from three directions, so that the 
shape will resemble the name. Leave no vent in the dough, but 
press the edges so firmly together that not a drop can escape. 
When all are laid in the baking pan, brush over with milk in 
which a little sugar is dissolved. Bake fifteen to twenty minutes.

194 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Planked Shad — Purchase a plank, at least two inches thick, 
made from hickory, just the size of your oven. Have it planed 
out in the middle, so that the juice will be held rather than 
running off the edge. Have your tish cleaned and dry, put it 
on the plank, skin side down. Then baste with two tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter, dust with salt and pepper, and cook in 
the oven for thirty minutes. When ready to serve, baste again 
with melted butter, and place parsley and slices of lemon around 
fish. Be sure and have the plank very hot when you place the 
fish upon it. Serve on the plank on a large platter or tray with 
a napkin laid between. 

Fried Egg Plant — Peel and cut the plant in slices less than 
one-half inch thick. Place in a quart of water with a table- 
spoonful of salt for two hours; drain and dip each slice in beaten 
egg and bread crumbs, and fry brown. 

Caramel Custards — Put a half cup of sugar in an iron sauce- 
pan over the fire. Stir until the sugar is melted. Add a table- 
spoonful of lemon juice and turn this into the bottoms of six 
custard cups. Beat three eggs without separating, add to them 
one and a half cups of milk, four tablespoonfuls of sugar and a

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 195 

ter in frying-pan, and when iiot (do not burn) pour in the beat- 
en eggs; now with a four-tined fork lift the omelet gently in 
places while it is cooking; omelets cooked in this way do not 
have to be turned. The cold water used with the egg is the secret 
of a light, flaky omelet. 

Lunch Rolls — One quart flour, one-half cake compressed 
yeast, one tablespoonful sugar, one tablespoonful butter (soft- 
ened), one teaspoonful salt. First place one pint of sifted flour 
in bread-pan, and pour over about one pint of boiling water; stir 
in the butter, salt and sugar. When cool add the yeast, dissolved 
in one-half cup lukewarm water, and the remaining flour. Set 
to rise over night. In the morning knead and roll out about one 
and one-half inches thick; cut with round or oblong cutter; let 
get light, then bake twenty-five minutes in moderate oven. 
Enough for two meals. These are alv\rays successful if boiling 
v/ater is used, and are always sweet, light and delicious. 

Oyster Pate with Crumbs — One pint of oysters; add one-half 
pint milk, one teaspoonful salt. Let boil up once, then take one 
cupful of rolled cracker crumbs mixed with cold milk (or water) 
and pour into oysters; stir and boil two minutes; add teaspoon- 
ful butter and a little pepper. Place in baked pastry shell (or 
buttered pudding-dish) and bake in oven till brown. 

Macaroni Tufts — Break one-quarter pound macaroni into 
inch pieces; boil in salted water twenty minutes. Let it get cold, 
then pour over it one beaten egg. Pull out tufts or pieces of uni- 
form size and cook in hot fat. Serve on folded napkin with 
grated cheese. 

Boiled Beef with Parsley Sauce — Boil four pounds of beef 
with four cloves, one inch stick cinnamon, one-half teaspoon

half-cupful of water; add one-half teaspoonful of salt; cook 
twenty minutes, stirring well; four minutes before removing 
from the fire stir in two eggs very well beaten. Serve each dish 
with cream and sugar. 

Ham Toast — Mince finely a quarter-pound of cooked ham 
with an anchovy, boned and washed; add a dash of cayenne and 
pounded mace; beat up an egg, mix with the mince and add a 
quarter-cupful of milk. Put on fire in sauce-pan for three min- 
utes and serve on toasted bread. 

Salt Mackerel with Cream Sauce — Soak one pound of mack- 
erel over night in lukewarm water, changing this in the morn- 
ing for cold water; rub all the salt, off and wipe dry; grease 
your gridiron v/ith suet and rub the fish on both sides with a 
tablespoonful of melted butter; then broil quickly over a clear 
fire, turning with a cake turner so as not to break it; lay upon 
a hot- water dish and cover until the sauce is ready; heat a tea- 
cupful of milk tp scalding; stir into it a teaspoonful of corn- 
starch, wet with as much water; when this thickens add two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, a dash of pepper and a pinch of salt 
and a tablespoonful of minced parsley; beat an egg light, pour

and stir one minute, not more; pour upon the fish and let it

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 199 

spoonfuls of wheat flour on a saucer and lay them on a. greased 
gridiron over a bright fire of coals; when both sides are browned 
nicely take them on a hot dish, sprinkle lightly with salt and 
pepper and pour an ounce of melted butter over them and serve 
hot. 

Cream Waffles — Three tablespoonfuls of cornstarch and one 
cup of flour, stirred smoothly together; add a saltspoon of salt. 
Gradually mix in a pint of sour milk, one egg, well beaten, and 
a small teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a tablespoonful of water; 
pour into hot waffle irons; bake ten minutes and spread with 
butter before sending to table. 

Beefsteak and Kidney Pudding — Divide two pounds of rump 
steak into inch-square pieces, and two kidneys, each into eighth 
pieces. Make a crust of six ounces of finely chopped beef suet 
and one-quarter teaspoonful of salt rubbed well into a pound of 
flour; work the whole to a smooth paste with one-half pint of 
milk; roll it out and line a deep dish, leaving an inch of crust 
to overlap the edge and enough left for the top crust. Then 
cover the bottom with a portion of the steak and a few pieces of 
kidnejs season with a light sprinkling of pepper, salt and flour; 
add another layer of steak, kidney and seasoning. Proceed in 
this manner till the meat is all used, when pour in sufficient water 
to come within two inches of the top of the basin. Moisten the 
edge of the crust, cover the pudding over, press the two crusts 
together that the gravy may not escape and turn up the over- 
hanging paste. Wring out a cloth in hot water, flour it and tie 
up the pudding. Put it into boiling water and let it boil four 
hours. If the water diminishes always replenish with some hot 
from a kettle, as the pudding should be kept covered with it all 
the time and not allowed to stop boiling. When the cloth is re- 
moved cut a round piece in the top of the crust to prevent the 
pudding bursting and send it to the table in the basin, either in 
an ornamental dish or with a napkin pinned around it. Serve 
quickly. 

Potato Snow — Choose six large white potatoes, as free from 
spots as possible; boil them in their skins in water (to which a 
tablespoonful of salt has been added) until perfectly tender; 
drain and dry them thoroughly by the side of the fire and peel 
them. Put a hot dish before the fire; rub the potatoes through 
a coarse sieve on to this dish; do not touch them afterward, or 
the fiakes will fall, and serve as hot as possible. 

White Puffs — Whisk the whites of four eggs, whipped stiff, 
and one scant cup powdered sugar to a meringue, and add this 
alternately with one heaping cup of flour, well sifted, with a 
teaspoonful of baking-powder, to a pint of milk; add the grated 
peel of half a lemon and a pinch of salt; beat until the mixture 
is very light and bake in buttered cups or tins ten minutes in a 
quick oven. Turn out on a plate. Sift a teaspoonful of powdered 
sugar over them and serve with lemon sauce. These are delicate 
in texture and pleasing to the eye. 

Lemon Sauce — Put in a tin pail a mixture of one cup sugar, 



200 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

half a cup of butter, one egg, one lemon, juice and grated rind; 
three tablespoonfuls of boiling water, and thicken by placing 
and stirring for one minute over steam of boiling water in kettle.

season the gravy with pepper, salt and tomato catchup and thicken 
with browned flour; pour half of it over the meat and send the 
remainder to the table in a boat.

with two-thirds of a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper; 
mix thoroughly; divide the mixture in five parts, spread in

powder, a lump of lard the size of a small walnut, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt; sift the baking powder in the flour, add the salt, rub 
the lard into the flour; add enough cold water to make a stiff 
batter, from one pint to one pint and a half. Stir well; drop in 
greased pan; bake in hot oven. 

Cheese Fondu — One pint sweet milk, one bowl bread crumbs, 
one bowl cheese cut in small pieces, stir until smooth; add one 
beaten egg, saltspoon of salt, then set away until half-hour be- 
fore using. Place in oven long enough to brown, in dish in which 
it is served.

milk, a pinch of salt, pinch of cinnamon, two teaspoonfuls baking 
powder stirred in three cups of flour; beat all- together until

and let it stand five minutes, then drain and steam. Serve cold. 



214 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Rice Crusts — Cook one cup cold boiled rice in the double 
boiler with one-half cup milk until the rice is very soft. Add one 
tatalespoonful of sugar, a saltspoonful of salt, one beaten egg and 
flour enough to make it hold together. Spread on a tin, having 
the mixture one-third of an inch thick. Bake in a very hot oven 
till brown. Split and eat with sirup. 

White-Sugar Sirup — One cup sugar, one-third cup water, one 
teaspoonful butter. Boil the sugar with the water until it thick- 
ens slightly. Add the butter and serve hot as soon as the butter 
is melted. 

Chartreuse of Fish — Take one cup of any cold fish, flake it 
and season with one saltspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper, 
and moisten with a little cream. Take the same quantity of sea- 
soned mashed potatoes and two hard-boiled eggs. Butter a small 
mold and put in alternate layers of potatoes, fish and slices of 
egg. Steam twenty minutes, turn out upon a hot platter and gar- 
nish with parsley. 

Gluten Gems — Two cups gluten flour, one-half teaspoonful 
salt, two teaspoonfuls baking powder, one tablespoonful sugar, 
one egg, two cups water. Sift the baking powder with the flour, 
add the water, sugar and salt, and then the beaten egg. Bake in 
very hot buttered gem pans in a hot oven half an hour.

flour, two eggs, one tablespoonful milk, one heaping teaspoonful 
baking powder. Cream the butter, add the sugar, milk and beat- 
en egg, and the baking powder mixed- with the flour. Roll out 
the mixture one-third of an inch thick, cut with a doughnut cut- 
ter, sprinkle granulated sugar over and bake a delicate brown. 

Sago Soup — One quart stock, two tablespoonfuls sago, one 
scant teaspoonful salt, one-half saltspoonful pepper. Wash the 
sago until it comes clear, put it to cook in cold water; let it heat 
slowly until quite tender, then add it to the boiling stock and 
serve. 

Crisped Crackers — Split butter crackers and spread with but- 
ter; put them, the buttered side up, into a pan and brown in a 
hot oven. They are delicious in fish chowder and oyster stews. 

Pricandeau of Veal — Get three pounds of lean veal from the 
top of the leg. Trim and rub well with salt, pepper and flour. 
Cut two small onions into dice and fry them till a light brown in 
salt-pork fat. Take out the onions and brown the meat all over 
in the fat, adding more fat if needed. Put the meat into a pan 
on skewers to keep it from sticking. Add one quart of boiling 
water and one tablespoonful of mixed herbs, tied in a bag. Cover 
closely and cook in a moderate oven three hours, basting every 
thirty minutes. Turn over in an hour and a half; add more 
water so as to have one pint left for gravy. When done take up 
the meat and remove the herbs from the gravy. Thicken the 
gravy with two tablespoonfuls of flour wet in a little cold water, 
add one-fourth teaspoon salt, one-half saltspoon pepper. Cook 
five minutes and pour the gravy over the meat. 

Potato Croquettes — One pint of hot mashed potatoes, one 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 215 

tablespoonful of butter, half a saltspoonful of white pepper, half 
a teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of celery salt, and the 
yolk of one egg. Mix all but the egg, and beat very light. When 
slightly cool, add the yolk of the egg and mix well. Rub through 
a sieve and add one teaspoonful of chopped parsley. Shape into 
round balls, then into rolls. Roll in fine bread crumbs, then dip 
in beaten egg, then roll in crumbs again. Pry in smoking hot 
lard one minute. Drain and serve in the form of a pyramid. 

Creamed Asparagus — Wash carefully and break (not cut) 
into inch pieces as far as each stalk can be broken. When it 
will not snap off quickly, the stalk is too tough to be used. Cook 
in boiling salted water fifteen minutes. Drain and make a white 
sauce of one cup of the water in which the asparagus was cooked 
and one cup of milk, thickened with tvv^o heaping tablespoonfuls 
flour and two tablespoonfuls butter cooked together; season with 
one saltspoonful salt and half a saltspoonful v/hite pepper. Have 
ready oblongs of toast. Put the asparagus on them and pour the 
white sauce over all. 

Cornstarch Meringue — One pint hot milk, beaten yolks of 
three eggs, one and one-half tablespoonfuls of sugar, one-half 
saltspoonful salt, one-half teaspoonful vanilla, one heaping table- 
spoonful cornstarch, wet with enough milk to pour. Cook all 
together in a double boiler twenty minutes. Pour into a pudding- 
dish. Beat the whites of the eggs to a froth, add three table- 
spoonfuls of sugar gradually and beat till stiff enough to keep in 
shape. Put the meringue on the custard, set in the oven and 
brown the top. Serve with vanilla wafers.

216 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Moonshine — This dessert combines a pretty appearance with 
palatable flavor, and is a convenient substitute for ice cream. 
Beat the whites of six eggs in a broad plate to a very stiff froth, 
then add gradually six tablespoons powdered sugar (to make it 
thicken use more sugar up to a pint), beating for not less than 
thirty minutes, and then beat in about one heaping tablespoon 
of preserved peaches cut in tiny bits (or some use one cup of 
jelly), and set on ice until thoroughly chilled. In serving pour 
in each saucer some rich cream sweetened and flavored with va- 
nilla. This quantity is enough for seven or eight persons. 

Bean Soup — Boil a small soup bone in about two quarts of 
water until the meat can be separated from the bone; remove 
bone, add a coffeecup white beans which have been soaked for 
two hours, boil for an hour and a half, add three potatoes, half 
a turnip and a parsnip, all sliced fine; boil half an hour longer, 
and just before serving sprinkle in a few dry bread crumbs; sea- 
son with three-quarters of a teaspoon salt and one-fourth tea- 
spoon pepper. 

Turnips — Pare, slice and cut in pieces an inch square; boil 
till nearly done in as little water as possible; to one quart of 
turnips add one tablespoon sugar, a little salt; when boited al- 
most dry add three tablespoons cream and a beaten egg and 
serve. 

Apple Batter Pudding — Peel and slice very thin four large 
apples; make a batter of two eggs, pinch of salt, one cup sugar, 
one cup flour, one teaspoon baking powder, one-half cup boiling 
water (put in last) ; put layer of apples in a deep dish, sprinkle 
bits of butter and handful sugar over same, then batter, repeat- 
ing until dish is full, having batter come on top. Steam one hour, 
and eat hot, with caramel sauce. 

Caramel Sauce — One cupful granulated sugar, one cupful 
water. Put the sugar into an iron sauce-pan, stir with a wooden 
spoon over a quick fire until the sugar melts and turns an amber 
color, then add the water. Let boil two minutes and turn out 
to cool. Mrs. Agnes M. Dunning.

■ DINNER. 

Soup en reverie. Favorite stew of beef, 

Mushrooms and potatoes, with sauce. 

Delicate salad. Wafers. , 

Cheese a la delicatesse. 
Rhubarb dumplings, golden sauce. 



Mock Quail on Toast — To prepare; select two medium-sized 
pork shanks, scrape well, wash thoroughly and wipe dry. Place 
a plate in the bottom of an iron kettle and place the shanks 
thereon. Pour over three pints of boiling water and a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and boil steadily until the flesh will readily fall from 
the bones. Pour off the liquor into a pan, lift out the plate of 
meat and set away to use as required; or proceed to prepare 
this dish named by selecting unbroken parts of the meat about 
three inches long. Lay them in a plate, in a steamer, over hot 
salted water. While steaming prepare a sauce by reheating one 
cupful of the pot liquor with one-half cupful of cream, one salt- 
spoon of salt and one-fourth teaspoon Qf white pepper, a pinch of 
nutmeg' (grated), if liked. Prepare five pieces of white bread 
toast, butter slightly, lay a piece of meat on each slice of toast, 
place on a platter and pour sauce over. If the sauce is preferred 
thickened, add one-half tablespoon of cornstarch rubbed smooth 
in milk, and allow to boil up once before pouring over toast. A 
very dainty dish. 

Fish Croquettes — Stir one tablespoonful of butter and one of 
flour together in a sauce-pan over the fire and two-thirds cup of 
milk (water will do). Boil up once and add one small half -tea- 
spoonful of salt, quarter as much pepper, then remove and stir 
in the yolks of two eggs. Rub a deep plate with salad oil, pour 
the mixture in and stir in gently one cupful of flakes of cold 
cooked flsh. Allow to cool thoroughly. Make out into cork- 
shaped rolls. Wet the hands to prevent sticking. Roll in sifted 
bread crumbs, then in beaten egg; roll again in bread crumbs, 
lay in a wire basket, hang in boiling fat and fry a delicate 
brown. Lift out with a skimmer, lay on brown paper a moment. 
These are excellent. The finer the bread crumbs, the more sure 
one is of success. 

Soup en Reverie — Cleanse well and cook half a pound of fresh 
spinach in one pint of cold water until it is soft enough to pass 
through a sieve. Add to it three cupfuls of unsalted beef stock, pass 
through a sieve, add one teaspoonful of salt, one-third teaspoon 
of pepper, and set over the fire. Then add five fried rice balls, 
five fried egg balls; boil five minutes, add five croutons and serve 
in cups. 

Favorite Stew of Beef, Mushrooms and Potatoes with Sauce — 
Three and one-half pounds of rump from beef; wipe thoroughly 
and place in pot with five pints of boiling v/ater and cook slowly 
and steadily, turning and lifting occasionally so it will cook 
evenly; if necessary to add more water, add only boiling water. 



218 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

using as little as possible. Cook this one hour, then add one 
heaping teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth teaspoon of pepper. 
Smother gently two hours longer, when there should be about 
one cup of sauce in kettle. Add seven good-sized potatoes, cover 
very tightly and steam thirty minutes; do not allow to scorch. 
Remove meat and set in warming oven, and as soon as the pota- 
toes are brown and tender lay on platter around meat. Set kettle 
over the fire, add half a can of mushrooms, stir and fry carefully 
eight minutes; then add one-half cup cold water, half a cup of 
cream and one heaping teaspoonful of cornstarch dissolved in a 
little cream; stir up well and bring to a boil. Take up the mush- 
rooms, place around the platter with the potatoes. Serve sauce in 
sauce tureen. 

Delicate Salad — One head of lettuce, six breakfast radishes 
(one cucumber, if in season) and one-half pint of the cold boiled 
pork shank. Pick the meat into flakes; use a salad plate; arrange 
alternately in layers as follows: Wash the lettuce, wipe quite 
dry by pressing in a napkin; slice the unpeeled radishes thinly; 
peel and slice the cucumber thinly; line the plate with lettuce 
leaves, sprinkle on lightly one-third of the pork, a layer of rad- 
ishes, then some cucumber slices, lettuce, pork, radishes, cucum- 
bers, and so continue until complete. Pour over — 

White Mayonnaise Without Oil — Put the yolks of two raw 
eggs, one tablespoon of butter, a dash of cayenne pepper and 
one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt in a saucepan over hot water; 
stir continuously. When it begins to thicken add by degrees two 
more tablespoons of butter. When thick and smooth strain into 
a bowl for future use. When ready to serve stir in four table- 
spoonfuls of whipped cream, and, if preferred, two tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar may be added. 

Rhubarb Dumplings — Cut up and cook one and one-half 
pounds of rhubarb in one heaping cup of sugar and one-half cup 
of hot water. Cook seven minutes. Make a paste of one-half cup 
of flour, scant half-cup of butter and one-half teaspoonful of bak- 
ing powder, bind together with cold water, roll out, cut in four-inch 
rounds. Place two tablespoonfuls of the stewed rhubarb in each 
round, gather up the dough into balls, pinch the edges together, 
brush with milk, sprinkle with sugar. Bake in hot oven. Serve 
with the remaining sauce, to which has been added a lump of 
butter the size of a hickory nut. Thicken with one teaspoon of 
cornstarch (or arrowroot) dissolved in one tablespoonful of cold 
water. Boil up. Serve hot. Mrs. Edith Uhlig.

Tea, hot or iced. 



DINNER 

Cream of cheese soup. Crackers. 

Veal cutlet au gratin. Riced potatoes.

Stewed Rhubarb or Pieplant — Wash the stalks well in cold 
water; if very tender do not skin, otherwise remove the outer 
skin; cut in one-half-inch pieces, put into a porcelain saucepan 
or into a white baking-dish, cover with one-half the weight of 
the rhubarb in white sugar, and place on back of stove to cook 
slowly. It will soon make a juice; cover and let cook until per- 
fectly tender. It requires no water cooked in this way. 

Broiled Shad — The most delicate way to cook a shad is to 
broil it. Select one whose flesh is firm and gills bright red. After 
the fish is cleaned wash in cold water, wipe it and salt well. The 
fish should be split down the back for broiling and the backbone 
taken out with a sharp knife (although this latter is not, of course, 
necessary), and the fins trimmed off. Rub the broiler with butter 
or bacon drippings so the fish will not stick to it; broil over clear 
coals, quickly at first, then very slowly, allowing about ten min- 
utes for each inch of thickness. In broiling the inside should be 
exposed to the fire first, then the skin, and great care taken the 
skin does not burn. Have the dish very hot to serve it in, and 
baste with a small piece of butter; sprinkle with one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt. The roes may be salted and kept perfectly well 
in a cold place for next day's breakfast if not needed with the 
fish. They are to be fried in boiling lard a golden brown, after 
being sprinkled with flour or cornmeal. Put them in common 
brown paper in the oven for a moment before placing on a hot 
dish. 

Broiled Potatoes — Have potatoes boiled and cold; cut into 
slices one-third of an inch thick; dip them in melted butter and

fine bread crumbs and broil over a fire that is not too hot; season 
with salt and pepper. 

Wheat Muffins — Muffins raised with yeast (made at bedtime) 
are the nicest, and can be so made until warm weather, when it 
would be safest to make in the morning with yeast powder. One 
pint of milk scalded and let cool, one-fourth of compressed yeast 
cake dissolved in tepid water, one quart of flour (sifted), one 
tablespoon of butter or lard, three eggs well beaten, one eggspoon 
of salt, one teaspoon of white sugar. Beat the sugar and salt into 
the eggs, then add the butter and a little flour; cream all together; 
when smooth add the yeast, then flour and milk alternately, beat- 
ing constantly until you have a perfectly smooth batter. Cover 
with a cloth and let rise in a moderately warm place. In the 
morning have muffin-pan greased, take batter out lightly with a 
large spoon, and half fill the compartments; let rise again an 
hour or little less and bake in a good oven. Can be also baked 
on top of stove in muffin-rings placed on a hot greased griddle, 
if preferred. 

Deviled Clams — Two dozen clams; take out the hearts or the 
hard centers. Put in chopping-bowl and chop very fine. Have 
half the quantity of bread crumbs; one teaspoon of finely chopped 
spring onion, one of parsley, dash of red pepper, one-half teaspoon 
salt, add three tablespoons melted butter. Mix all well together 
with a fork. Have clam shells clean and dry. Grease lightly, fill 
with the mixture, place grated crumbs and a small dot of butter on 
top; put into a pan and brown in a good oven. 

Lettuce Sandwiches — Cut the ' bread into thin slices, butter 
lightly, take off crust or not, as you please; cut into half slices. 
Have the small leaves of lettuce, which have been nicely washed 
in cold water and dried, on each half slice of bread put a lettuce 
leaf; spread with mayonnaise dressing and add the other half 
slice of bread. The yolk of one egg, either raw or hard boiled, 
with the needed, oil, vinegar, etc., will make plenty of dressing 
needed for the lunch sandwiches. 

Lemon Jelly — Half box Nelson's gelatine, dissolved for an 
hour in half pint cold water; then add one pint water boiling hot, 
three-quarters pound of sugar, half pint juice of fresh lemons, 
after the sugar is entirely dissolved; stir all together, strain and 
put to cool, then in the icebox to harden. 

Cream of Cheese Soup — One pint of milk, one slice of onion, 
one slice of carrot, two tablespoons butter, one even tablespoon 
of fiour, two full tablespoons of Parmesan cheese, yolks of two 
eggs, salt and pepper. Put the milk on to boil with onion and 
carrot. • Rub the butter and fiour together until smooth. Remove 
the vegetables from the milk, add butter and flour and stir con- 
stantly until it thickens. Add the cheese and stir three minutes. 
Now take it from the fire, add the beaten yolks of two eggs, salt 
and pepper and serve at once. This soup can not be heated over. 
One blade of mace can be used if liked. Buy the cheese solid and 
grate it; this is cheaper. This is a very delicious soup. 

Veal Cutlet au Gratin— Have your cutlet cut from an inch 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 221 

and a half to two inches thick. Make a dressing of finely grated 
bread crumbs, seasoned with melted butter, chopped onion, a very- 
little parsley, salt and red pepper. Put it on top of the cutlet, 
one-half of an inch thick. Place cutlet in a hot pan, cover with 
another pan and place in a moderately hot oven to cook slowly. 
The crumbs keep the cutlet juicy, and it should be uncovered and 
let brown at the last. 

Asparagus on Toast — Have salted water boiling hard; wash 
the asparagus in cold water and tie again in a bunch; put it in the 
boiling water and cover and let cook until tender. Have several 
slices of bread nicely toasted; cut into quarters. When aspara- 
gus is tender dip each piece of toast for a moment in the boiling 
water and place in a hot dish; then add the asparagus and pour 
over all either melted butter or drawn butter, made thus: Cream 
two teaspoonfuls of flour and two tablespoonfuls of butter until 
light and smooth; gradually add one-half pint of boiling water or 
milk; stir constantly until it comes to a boil, but do not let it boil; 
add a quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, and pepper if desired. 

Riced Potatoes — Have a flat dish and the colander hot. With 
a spoon rub seasoned mashed potato through the colander into 
the hot dish; be careful the colander does not touch the potato 
in the dish; it is best to have only a few spoonfuls of the potato 
in it at one time. When all has been pressed through place the 
dish in the oven for five minutes to insure its being hot. 

Dandy Pudding — One quart of milk; let it come to a boil; 
then stir in three tablespoonfuls of cornstarch which have been 
dissolved perfectly in cold milk; have the yolks of four eggs 
well beaten, one-half cupful of sugar, pinch of salt, tablespoonful 
of butter; stir all these into the boiling milk slowly until smooth; 
then pour into a greased baking-dish and put in oven. When 
baked and cold have the whites of the eggs beaten to a froth, 
sweetened with four tablespoonfuls of sugar and fiavored with a 
few drops of vanilla, rose or almond; place on top of pudding 
and set in the oven for a moment to harden. To be eaten cold.

has been left over from a previous meal. To every cupful of cooked 
spinach add one beaten egg; stir well and pour into a well-but- 
tered baking-dish and cook in hot oven fifteen minutes. 

Little Strawberry Puddings — To one quart of berries add two 
cupfuls of sugar. Stir them together so that the berries will be 
slightly mashed. Prepare for the batter two eggs, one table- 
spoonful butter, one teaspoonful baking powder or pinch of salt, 
one cup of milk and one and one-half cups of flour. Butter some 
cups and put in a layer of batter, then a layer of berries, until

Grilled Beef — Cut thin slices of cold roast beef about three 
inches long and one and one-half inches wide, and then dip them 
in a dressing made as follows: Beat an egg until light, then beat 
in, a few drops at a time, one tablespoonful of olive oil (or melted 
butter) and the same quantity of lemon juice or vinegar, al- 
ternating the oil and vinegar, and beating all until the dressing 
Is thick like cold cream; add a saltspoonful of salt, a little white 
pepper, half a teaspoonful of mustard and a dash of cayenne. 
Dip the meat in the dressing and broil over a clear fire until it 
browns a little and is well heated through, remove to a hot plat- 
ter, put a piece of butter on each piece, set in the oven a moment 
and serve. 

Ham Toast — Remove the fat from some slices of cold boiled 
ham; chop fine; should be a large cupful. Put two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter into a sauce-pan on the stove; add the chopped ham 
and half a teacupful of sweet cream or milk. Season with one- 
fourth saltspoon pepper, and when hot remove from the stove and 
stir in quickly three well-beaten eggs. Pour the mixture over thin 
slices of toast and serve at once. 

Mayonnaise Sauce — Beat the yolk of an egg thoroughly; add 
half a teaspoonful of mustard powder and a teaspoonful of salt, 
and stir all well together; now beat in slowly, a few drops at a 
time, four tablespoonfuls of olive oil; when the sauce begins to 
be quite stiff alternate a few drops of lemon juice (or vinegar) 
with the oil and continue beating. When the oil and egg have 
been well beaten together add a very little cayenne, and a few 
drops at a time, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 

Sago Soup — Wash three ounces of sago in boiling water and 
add it gradually to two quarts of nearly boiling stock, with one- 
half teaspoon salt, one-fourth teaspoon pepper. Simmer for half 
an hour, when it should be well dissolved. Beat up the yolks of 
three eggs, add them to half a pint of milk or cream, stir quickly 
into the soup and serve immediately. Don't let the soup boil after 
the eggs are put in or it will curdle. 

Broiled Shad — Do not remove the skin, but scale, draw, cut 
down the back on the inside on both sides of the bone. Remove 
the bone, then wash, wipe dry and rub with a little salt on the 

15 



226 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

inside. Place on a hot, well-buttered broiler, with the inside 
down, turning over the broiler to cook the other side. Attend 
closely to it. The time required for broiling will, of course, de- 
pend upon the size of fish. • When through broiling place the fish 
in a buttered roasting-pan in the oven and cover closely to pre- 
vent drying. This will allow every portion to become cooked 
through while preparing the sauce. 

Sauce for Pish — Two small tablespoonfuls of melted butter, 
one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper, one-fourth teaspoonful salt and 
the juice of a lemon. Mix well together and pour over the shad, 
after removing it to a hot platter. 

Before broiling the shad place the roes in a spider of hot fat. 
Season with pepper and salt and cook well through. They should 
be crisp and brown on the outside. Serve on the platter with the 
fish. 

Cowslip Greens — About a peck of cowslip leaves will be re- 
quired for a little over a pint when cooked. Look over carefully 
and wash well. Lay them in cold water for tv/enty minutes. Put 
over to cook in abundance of boiling water; boil ten minutes. 
Drain off the water and cover again with boiling water. Put in 
a half-tablespoonful of salt and cook from thirty to forty minutes. 
When done put into a colander, drain and press out all of the 
water. Return to the stove in a sauce-pan and season with one- 
fourth teaspoonful of pepper and a tablespoonful of butter. Cut 
through with a sharp knife and mix thoroughly. Put in a hot 
dish and garnish, if liked, with cold boiled eggs. Serve with 
vinegar. 

Potatoes a I'ltalienne — This way of cooking potatoes requires 
fully ripe, dry and mealy potatoes. Pare and boil them. When 
done, instead of mashing, beat as light as possible with a large 
vegetable fork. For a quart of potatoes beat in a large table- 
spoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of salt, half a teacupful of cream 
or milk and the yolks of two eggs well beaten; when these in- 
gredients are thoroughly mixed with the potato, add the whites 
of the eggs, beaten stiff. Pile in a warm dish as lightly as pos- 
sible and serve. The yolks may be omitted and the potatoes may 
be lightly browned in the oven. 

Fruit Pudding — Cut four seedless oranges into a fineware 
crock (such as can be put in the oven with safety) and spread 
half a teacupful of sugar over fhem. In a sauce-pan on the stove 
put a pint of water, two teacupfuls of sugar and the juice of three 
lemons. When this boils add one tablespoonful of cornstarch 
dissolved in milk, and when it thickens remove from stove. Now 
add three well-beaten eggs, after reserving the whites of two. 
Pour the contents of the sauce-pan over the oranges and cover 
the whole with the thoroughly beaten whites of the two eggs, to 
which a little sugar has been added. Put in the oven until slight- 
ly browned. Allow to cool in the refrigerator and pour as deftly 
as possible into a large dessert dish. Spread strawberries over 
the top, plentifully sprinkled with powdered sugar.

per to suit taste. Let it come to a boil, then pour into a tureen 
in which you have placed a few large round crackers. 

Smothered Steak with Plantains — Broil quickly over a hot

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 229 

Baked Rhubarb— Cut strawberry rhubarb into inch pieces 
without removing the skin, sprinkle one-half teacup of sugar 
over each pint of the well-washed fruit and place in a pudding- 
dish without any water; cover closely and bake just long enough 
to make tender. Each piece will retain its shape and the juice 
have the color and flavor of strawberry. 

Par Excellence Rice — Cook one teacup of well-washed rice in 
three pints of boiling salted water twenty minutes. Pour in col- 
ander; return the drained rice to the hot kettle, which must be 
well greased with butter. Add tablespoonful of butter to the top, 
cover with hot lid, and, when well dried, dish and serve either 
with sirup or cream. 

Marrow Toast — Have the butcher split a shin bone; remove 
the marrow and cut it into inch-thick slices. Boil ninety seconds 
in a quart of salted water. Have ready in a hot dish one tea- 
spoon of chopped parsley, one of lemon juice, half a teaspoon of 
salt, a grain of cayenne and six drops of onion juice. Drain the 
marrow and mix with the seasoning in the hot dish; spread on 
squares of crisp, hot toast and serve very hot. 

Swiss Eggs — Line a pie plate with thin slices of cheese. In 
one cup of milk mix one teaspoon of mustard and one-tenth of 
teaspoon of red pepper, one-half teaspoon of salt. Pour half of 
this mixture over the cheese, then carefully break in five eggs so 
as not to disturb the yolks, then pour the rest of the milk over 
them. Bake ten minutes, or until the eggs are set. The cheese on 
melting thickens the milk and makes a nourishing dish. 

Peach Foam — Chop a can of peaches, heat, and thicken with- 
three tablespoons of cornstarch dissolved in a little water. Add 
the juice of half a large lemon. Remove from fire, and when 
nearly cold whip in the beaten whites of three eggs. Serve quite 
cold. 

Date Biscuit — To one pint of bread sponge add two table- 
spoons of sugar and enough graham flour to make stiff; add one 
cup of washed chopped dates, mold into small cakes, dip in melt- 
ed butter or lard; let rise, and bake. 

Oatmeal Nectar — Put four ounces of oatmeal into a porcelain 
kettle, add six ounces of white sugar and a lemon sliced thin; 
mix with a little cold water, then pour on one gallon of boiling 
water. When cold drain off, and it will be a nourishing and re- 
freshing drink. 

Baked Shad or Whitefish — Make a dressing of one pint of 
bread crumbs seasoned with one-half teaspoon of salt, one table- 
spoon of butter, one-half teaspoon of pepper and moistened with 
stock if convenient. Place in fish, tie up, rub over fish one-half 
teaspoon salt, one-fourth teaspoon pepper and place over the fish 
a few slices of thin breakfast bacon. Bake until well done, basting 
with water and butter. Transfer fish to hot dish, garnish with 
the strips of bacon. Add a teaspoon each of lemon juice and 
anchovy sauce to the gravy in the pan, thicken with browned 
flour and send to table in a boat. A salad of watercress is a nice 
accompaniment. 



230 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Asparagus — As part of the strength of the asparagus was used 
in the soup it is well to serve it in a rich milk gravy. 

Serve the radishes with the heart of the green leaves left on 
and in a glass dish with bits of ice. 

Oranges and Strawberries Mixed — To one quart of strawber- 
ries add two oranges cut up in bits. Sprinkle with sugar and 
serve in a half hour or so very cold with sweet graham crackers 
or sponge drop cake.

taining a teaspoonful of butter; spread the prepared asparagus 
upon the upper side, and when perfectly hot fold the omelet to- 
gether and serve. 

Oatmeal Gems — Soak over night a cupful of oatmeal in a 
cupful of cold water. In the morning sift together one cupful 
of flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder and a very scant 
teaspoonful of salt. Add this to the soaked oatmeal and mix 
thoroughly. Wet the mixture with half a cup of sweet milk, 
thus making a stiff batter; drop into the buttered gem-pans and 
bake for fifteen minutes in a quick oven. 

Sweetbread and Cucumber Salad — Soak a small pair of sweet- 
breads for an hour in cold salted water. Then drop them into 
boiling salted water, to which you have added a teaspoonful of 
vinegar, and cook twenty-five minutes. Remove from fire and

fire in a stewpan; put in one slice of onion, two cloves, a tea- 
spoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. Boil twenty min- 
utes, then remove from the fire and strain through a sieve. Melt 
in a clean saucepan a tablespoonful of butter and as it melts 
sprinkle in a tablespoonful of fiour. Stir until it browns and 
froths a little. Mix the tomato pulp with it and it is ready for the 
table. Half of this quantity will be sufiicient to serve with the 
cutlets. Set the remainder aside to be reheated and served with 
macaroni, which has been boiled until tender, for luncheon on 
the following day. 

Spinach with Eggs — Take half a peck of spinach and wash 
it three or four times. Drain it and put it in boiling water. 
Cook twenty minutes, being careful to remove the scum. When 
it is quite tender take it up and drain it well. Chop it fine and 
put it into a saucepan with a piece of butter the size of an egg 
and a little salt and pepper, not more than a saltspoonful of 
each. Set it on the fire and let it stew five minutes, stirring it 
all the time. Turn into a vegetable dish, shape it into a mound 
and slice two or three hard-boiled eggs over the top. 

Potato Snow — Choose seven mealy potatoes; pare them and 
cook them well; drain them and mash thoroughly. Press them 
through a fine wire sieve into the dish in which they are to be 
served. Strew a little fine salt upon them previous to sending 
them to the table. 

Delmonico Pudding — Boil together one quart of milk, two 
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, five tablespoonfuls of sugar and 
two well-beaten eggs. Two minutes of actual boiling is suflacient 
time to cook it. When cool add one-half saltspoonful of salt and 
one cupful of shredded cocoanut. Pour into a pudding dish and 
bake until set and of a delicate brown color. Eat cold with 
cream. Miss Ermine Owen.

dish into another containing hot .water and let stand on the 
back of the stove for three hours; stir every fifteen minutes. 
At the end of the three hours add the beaten yolks of four eggs, 
one-half cup of sugar and one saltspoonful of salt; cook ten 
minutes, stirring constantly. Have the whites of the four eggs 
beaten so stiff with four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar that 
they stay in the dish when inverted. Take the tapioca from the 
fire and when it has stopped boiling beat the whites lightly 
through it; when cool flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla. This 
is dainty and delicious and is better made the day before using. 

Fish Chowder — Take four pounds of fresh haddock or cod; 
when buying a fish for chowder have the head left on but the 
skin removed. Begin at the tail and with a sharp knife cut the 
fish from the bone on one side, keeping the knife as close as 
possible to the bone; remove bone from other side, then take 
out the small bones near the head. Wipe the fish carefully with 
a damp cloth, cut it into pieces about two inches square and put 
it away in a cool place. Break the bones and head, cover with 
cold water and put them on to boii. Pare six good-sized raw 
potatoes and cut them into slices one-eighth of an inch in thick- 
ness, soak them in cold water one-half hour, put into a kettle 
of boiling water and boil five minutes; then pour off the water. 
Cut a two-inch cube of fat salt pork into quarter-inch dice, and 
fry it in an omelet pan; cut two small onions into thin slices' 
and fry them brown in the pork fat, being very careful that it 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 233 

does not burn. Pour the fat through a strainer into a clean 
kettle, leaving pork scraps and onions in the strainer. Put the 
sliced potatoes into this kettle; hold the strainer over the kettle 
and pour through it enough boiling water to cover the potatoes. 
When the potatoes have boiled ten minutes strain the water in 
which the bones have been boiling into the kettle containing the 
potatoes; add one tablespoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of 
white pepper, and when the chowder is boiling briskly put in 
the fish and set on the back of the stove where it can simmer 
for ten minutes. Be careful not to break the fish in stirring. 
Then add one tablespoonful of butter and one quart of hot milk, 
split six butter crackers and place them in the bottom of a 
warm tureen, pour the chowder over them and serve. 

Pineapple Bavarian Cream — Stew one pint can of grated pine- 
apple with one cup of sugar ten minutes. Soak one-half box 
of Cox's gelatine in one-half cup of cold water for half an hour, 
then add one-half cup of boiling water to thoroughly dissolve the 
gelatine. Strain this through an old napkin onto the pine- 
apple, add one cup of sugar and set away to cool. When the 
mixture is thoroughly cold and is beginning to thicken, add one 
pint of cream whipped so stiff it will stand alone. Stir the whole 
mixture quickly and lightly until nearly stiff enough to drop; 
then pour into molds and set on ice for half a day. 

Cocoanut and Raisin Cream Cake — One scant cup of butter, 
one and one-half cups of sugar, three eggs, one teaspoonful of 
vanilla, one saltspoonful of mace, one-half cup of milk, three 
cups of pastry flour, one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one- 
half teaspoonful of soda. Cream the butter and add the sugar 
gradually, the yolks of the three eggs beaten separately, then 
the vanilla and mace. Sift the flour and mix the soda and cream 
of tartar with it. Add the milk and flour alternately, a little at 
a time, and lastly the whites of the three eggs which have been 
beaten stiff and dry. Bake in shallow round pans. As soon 
as baked split and spread with a thin layer of currant jelly, and 
then with a filling made as follows: 

Cocoanut and Raisin Cream Pilling — One cup of raisins stoned 
and chopped fine, one-half cup of chopped almonds, one-half cup

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 235 

French Toast — Slice and trim the crust from some baker's 
bread. Beat one egg into one cup sweet milk. Dip slices into 
the mixture, which should be seasoned with one-fourth teaspoon 
salt and one-fourth saltspoon pepper. Fry, in hot dripping or 
lard, a delicate brown. 

Green Pea Cakes — Heat and mash two cups of peas left from 
yesterday's dinner and season with butter, one-fourth saltspoon 
pepper and one-half teaspoon salt. Let it cool, then add two 
eggs, well-beaten, a small cup sweet milk and last one-half cup 
sifted flour, well mixed with one teaspoon baking powder. Fry 
on a hot griddle, well greased. 

Miroton of Beef — Mince some cold beef — about one pound. 
Season with one-half teaspoonful salt and one-half saltspoonful of 
pepper and mix with two hard boiled eggs, chopped fine. Wet 
it with gravy or broth and cover with cold seasoned mashed po- 
tatoes, which have been mixed to a soft paste with milk and 
butter. Place in greased baking dish, cover with bread crumbs. 
Bake, covered, one-half hour. Then brown after removing the

four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar over them. Beat the 
whites of two eggs stiff. Gradually beat in the crushed fruit. 
Heap on glass dish. 

Kindergarten Cookies — Beat one egg well. Mix in one and 
one-half cups sugar. Add one cup sour cream, one-half teaspoon- 
ful soda and one-eighth of a grated nutmeg. Mix in enough 
sifted flour to make the batter stiff enough to roll out. Cut out, 
sprinkle sugar over them and bake in a quick oven. 

Pate de Foie de Veau — Parboil three pounds fresh calves' 
liver and cool. Mince with one-half pound of cold boiled ham. 
Beat the two yolks of the eggs used to make the "folly" for 
luncheon. Season with a coffeespoonful salt and a little pepper. 
Mix the minced meat with eggs, milk, butter the size of a walnut 
and bread crumbs enough to form a paste soft enough to pour. 
Grease or butter a baking dish and line with puff paste. Pour 
in the mixture and put on an upper crust. Set in the oven in 
a large shallow pan in which a cup of hot water has been poured. 
Bake an hour in a good moderate oven. 

Stewed Young Onions — Place a pint of young onions in boil- 
ing water and cook ten minutes. Pour off water and pour over 
them one cup milk, and stew till tender. Add half-teaspoon salt 
and one-fourth teaspoon pepper and a lump of butter the size 
of an olive. 

Strawberry Meringue — Take what puff paste you have left 
from the "pate" and roll out very thin. Cut it the size and shape 
of a large dinner plate and bake to a delicate brown in a quick 
oven. Roll what strawberries you have in powdered sugar. Pile 
and pack firmly on the crust, which has been well buttered, and 
cover with a meringue made of the whites of two eggs and two 
tablespoonfuls powdered sugar. Bake until the meringue is

Beef Croquettes — Take cold beef left from dinner the day 
before. Chop fine; have one cupful when it is chopped; then 
add two cupfuls of fine bread crumbs and moisten with three 
tablespoonfuls of milk; season with three-quarters of a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and one-fourth as much pepper. Form into balls, dip 
in beaten egg (one egg), roll in fine cracker crumbs and fry in 
hot beef drippings. 

Columbus Eggs — Peel the shells from ten hard-boiled eggs, 
and cut each egg in two through the center, cutting off a small 
piece from one end, so that they will stand on end. Pulverize 
the yolks and mix with two tablespoonfuls of cold lean ham, 
chopped fine; moisten with three tablespoonfuls of vinegar and 
season with one saltspoonful of salt and one teaspoon of mustard 
and a good pinch of pepper. Mix smooth and fill the empty 
whites, being careful not to break them, and press the two halves 
together. The filling which remains over may be made into a 
dressing by adding a little more vinegar and pouring over the 
eggs. 

Pineapple — Two hours before serving shred one pineapple 
and mix with it two-thirds of a cupful of sugar; let stand on ice 
or in refrigerator. 

Gold Cake — One cupful of sugar, one tablespoon of butter, 
yolks of five eggs and one whole egg, one-half cupful of milk, 
two cupfuls of flour, one teaspoon of vanilla, one heaping tea- 
spoonful baking powder. Cream butter and sugar; add the well- 
beaten eggs, then the milk, vanilla, fiour, and lastly the baking 
powder, just before putting in the oven. Bake in moderate oven. 

Potato Soup — In a kettle containing two quarts of hot water 
put one-half cupful of 'chopped bacon, three chopped onions, one- 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 237 

half teaspoon of pepper. Boil fifteen minutes; peel and slice one 
pint of raw potatoes, and boil the whole again until the potatoes 
are cooked to a pulp; strain and add more hot water if too thick. 

Frozen Custard — Take one quart of rich milk, the beaten 
yolks of three eggs and three-fourths of a cupful of sugar; cook 
until it begins to thicken, remove from the fire and cool; then 
add one tablespoonful of vanilla, one cupful of cream and the 
whites of the eggs beaten very firm; mix all together well and 
freeze. 

Angels' Food — Break the whites of eleven eggs into a large 
cake bowl and beat stiff; add gradually one and one-half tumbler- 
fuls of granulated sugar which has been sifted eight times; then 
one tumblerful of fiour which has been sifted five times; the 
fifth time sift in one teaspoonful of cream of tartar, then add 
one teaspoonful of vanilla. Keep stirring while you turn it into 
the pan. Bake from forty to fifty minutes in a moderate oven 
and in a pan that has never been greased. 

Many think angel's food an expensive cake, but when it is 
considered how cheap eggs are at this season of the year — while 
butter is high — it is one of the most economical cakes that can 
be made. Five of the yolks left should be used for the gold cake 
and those that remain can be scrambled for breakfast the next 
morning, or used in a baked custard, Mrs. R. G. Wilbur.

Stewed Kidney — Take a nice fresh beef kidney, let stand in 
cold water about ten minutes. Remove all fat and skin, then 
cut with a knife or chop into small pieces about the size of dice. 



238 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Put in a stew pot, just cover with cold water and put on over a 
very slow fire. Add a slice of onion, half a teaspoon salt, quarter 
teaspoon pepper, three dessertspoons canned tomatoes, half a 
teaspoon Worcestershire sauce. Let simmer, not boil, about an 
hour, or until tender. Take about a tablespoonful of the gravy 
in a cup and when cool mix with it a dessertspoon of flour to a 
smooth, thin paste; gradually stir into the kidneys until they 
seem thick enough. Let simmer a little while longer. Serve very 
hot in a covered dish. 

This can be prepared the day before and simply heated next 
morning for breakfast. Delicious. A beef kidney can be bought 
for 5 cents. 

The bread and butter can be cut as thin as a wafer by leaving 
the butter rather soft and spreading it on the loaf before cutting 
off the slice. Use a very sharp knife. Put in ice-box until lunch 
is ready. 

Roast of Rib-Mutton Chops — Get five or six rib chops cut 
in one piece. They will weigh about two pounds. Have the 
bones cracked by the butcher, making the roast easy to carve. 
This is a delicious roast and much nicer at this season than the 
leg of mutton. Cook in hot oven about forty minutes. 

Pineapple Fritters — Make a batter with one egg, beaten 
separately. Add half a cup of milk to the yolk, a pinch of salt, 
enough sifted flour to make a thick batter, the beaten white and 
half a teaspoon baking powder. Get a fresh pineapple, or a can 
of the eyeless and coreless pineapple; take as many slices as 
wanted and cut each one in two. Dip each piece in the batter 
and fry in smoking hot lard. Drain, sprinkle with powdered sugar 
and serve on a pretty dish with a plain linen doiley under the 
fritters or a napkin. One can of pineapple will do for two or 
three meals. Mrs. L. B. Russell.

Cream, of Asparagus Soup — Boil one quart of asparagus, cut 
in inch lengths, in one quart of water until tender. Rub through 
a colander and return to the water in which it was boiled; add 
one teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper. Heat one pint of 
milk; stir into it one tablespoonful of butter, rubbed with one of 
fiour; let it boil and pour into asparagus. Cut toasted bread in 
dice and pour soup over. Serve at once. 

Baked Shad with Lemon — Get a shad or any other seasonable 
fish weighing from three to four pounds. Make a dressing of one 
pint of fine bread crumbs, one tablespoonful minced onion, one 
tablespoonful butter, one beaten-egg, and one-half teaspoonful 
of salt and quarter-teaspoonful pepper. Stuff the fish and sew 
or tie it securely. Place in a baking-pan with one pint of water 
(cold). Lay strips of bacon on top of fish, sprinkle lightly with 
pepper and salt, and bake three-quarters of an hour, basting often. 
When done, thicken the gravy, pour over fish, and serve with 
thin slices of lemon. 

Junket — Sweeten to taste one quart of rich milk, stir in one 
tablespoonful liquid rennet and pour into a glass dish. Set near 
the stove where it will get warm, and as soon as it begins to 
thicken set away to get cold as possible. Sweeten some cream 
or rich milk, flavor with vanilla and pour over the junket when 
serving. Mrs. S. P. Carusi.

thirds of a teaspoon of salt and one-fourth teaspoon of pepper. 

Crullers — Three eggs, one saltspoonful of salt, two cups of

posed of three tablespoonfuls melted butter; walnut catsup and 
vinegar, one tablespoonful each; a half-teaspoonful of salt and 
a pinch of pepper, a spoonful each of currant jelly, home-made 
mustard and warm water; steam for half an hour. With rare 
roast beef this is very nice. 

Molasses Wafers — Mix well together one cupful of butter, 
one cupful of sugar, two cupfuls of molasses and two cupfuls of 
flour. Drop a few spoonfuls into a pan in different places and put 
in the oven. It will melt and run together. Let it bake until it 
begins to harden on the edges, then remove. Cut it into squares 
and while it is still hot and soft roll each piece around a stick. 

Fish Soup — Three pounds of any fresh fish when cleaned, 
skinned and beheaded, two cups of milk, heated with a pinch 
of soda, two tablespoons of flour rubbed up with three of butter, 
two beaten eggs, two tablespoonfuls of minced parsley, three

them. 

Larded Calf's Liver — Wash a fresh calf's liver and soak it for 
an hour in cold salted water; wipe dry and with a sharp knife 
make incisions clear through the liver an inch apart; into these 
put strips of fat salt pork long enough to project on both sides; 
into the bottom of the pot put a tablespoonful of minced onion, 
some chopped parsley, one-fourth teaspoon pepper and one-half 
cupful of strained tomato juice; on this lay the liver, sprinkle 
with salt and as much onion on top as there is below; cover 
lightly and set at one side the range where it will not reach the 
boiling point under an hour; gradually increase the heat, but 
never let it be strong for two hours more, when uncover the pot 
for the first time to test with a fork if it he tender; take out the 
liver and keep hot while you strain the gravy; thicken with a 
greatspoonful of browned flour wet in cold water; pour over the 
liver; carve the latter horizontally. 

Potato a la Royale — One pint of hot boiled potatoes, a half 
cupful of cream or milk, two tablespoonfuls butter, the whites 
of four eggs and yolk of one, one teaspoon salt, and one-fourth 
teaspoon pepper. Beat the potato very light and fine. Add the 
seasoning, cream and butter, then the whites of the eggs beaten 
stiff. Turn into a buttered dish. Smooth with a knife and brush 
over with the yolk of the egg, which has been well-beaten. 
Brown quickly and serve. 

Queen of Puddings — One and one-half cups sugar, two cups 
fine dry bread crumbs, five eggs, one tablespoonful of butter, one 
teaspoon vanilla, one quart rich milk and one-half cup jelly or

stir these together to a cream; add the bread crumbs soaked in 
milk, then the seasoning. Bake this in a large buttered pudding 
dish until the custard is set. Draw to the mouth of oven, spread 
over with jelly or jam. Cover this with a meringue made of the 
whipped whites and half cup of sugar. Shut the oven and bake 
until brown. Eat cold, with cream. Mrs. A. K. Yerkes.

when the sugar is thoroughly dissolved. Put on ice and serve 
cold. 

Trifles — Work one egg and a tablespoonful of sugar in as 
much flour as will make a stiff paste. Roll it as thin as a silver 
dollar and cut into small cakes. Drop a few at a time into hot 
lard. Cook until they rise to the surface and turn over. Re- 
move with a skimmer and drain. 

Iced Meat Jelly — Cut into small pieces a pound of soup meat 
and add water enough to cover, simmer slowly until all the nutri- 
ment is cooked out. Two hours before removing from the stove 
add a teaspoonful of savory herbs and a little salt. Keep the 
top clear of scum, and when done strain and set in a cold place. 
When it has jellied remove the grease from the top and place the 
jelly on ice. When ready to serve it, break it into moderate 
pieces with a spoon and serve in bouillon cups. 

Beefsteak with Rice — An unwritten law of epicures is that 
red meats shall be served rare and white meats well done. Beef- 
steak should always be cut at least an inch or one and one-half 
inches thick. Broil over a hot, even fire, and season only when 
done. Serve with the rice (which has been seasoned with butter, 
pepper and salt) banked around it on the platter and garnish with 
cress. 

Asparagus Salad — Wash, tie together the asparagus, and boil 
until done. When cold carefully cut the strings so that the ends 
will not break; lay away on the ice until it is to be used. Serve 
with a French dressing made by powdering the yolk of a hard- 
boiled egg, adding two parts of oil to one of vinegar, with salt 
and a little cayenne pepper. If a slight flavor of onion is relished, 
onion vinegar (made by pouring vinegar over a sliced onion and 
allowing it to stand) may be used. 

Strawberries in Snow — Pour one cupful of cold water and one 
of sugar over a half-package of Cox's gelatine. When soft add 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 245 

one cupful of boiling water and the juice of two lemons; then the 
whites of four well-beaten eggs (the whites left from the eggs 
used for the fruit salad can be utilized). Beat all together until 
very light and frothy; just before it "sets" add one pint of whole 
strawberries and pour into a mold which has been dipped in 
water. Serve very cold with cream. Annetta G. Crafts.

246 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

cupful of milk, half a teaspoonful of mixed mustard; cayenne 
enough to cover a silver 5-cent piece, one raw egg and six hard- 
boiled. Cook the bread and milk together until a smooth paste. 
Add to the ham and add the seasoning and raw egg. Mix thor- 
oughly. Break the shells from the hard-boiled eggs and cover 
with this mixture. Put in a frying basket and plunge into boiling 
fat for two minutes. 

Favorite Cookies — One cupful of butter, one and a half cup- 
fuls of sugar, one-half cupful of sour milk, one-quarter teaspoon- 
ful of soda, a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg. Flour enough to roll;

and bake in a quick oven a light brown. 

Banana Cream — After peeling the bananas mash them with 
a wooden spoon; allow equal quantities of bananas and sweet 
cream; to one quart of the mixture allow one-quarter of a pound 
of sugar. Beat all together until light. 

Veal Cutlets with White Sauce — One and a half pounds of 
cutlets, two tablespoonfuls of butter, a slice of carrot and a small 
slice of onion. Put the butter and the vegetables, cut fine, in a 
saucepan. Season the cutlets with three-quarters of a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper and lay them on the 
butter and vegetables. Cover tightly and cook slowly for 
half an hour; then take out the cutlets, dip in egg and bread 
crumbs and fry in smoking hot fat till a golden brown. Serve 
with a white sauce poured on. Put a quart of green peas in the 
center of the dish, lay the cutlets around and pour a sauce over 
them made as follows: 

White Sauce — Add two tablespoonfuls of flour to the butter 
and vegetables in which the cutlets were cooked. Stir until 
smooth, being careful not to brown. Add a pint of milk gradu- 
ally, stirring all the while. Season with a saltspoonful of salt 
and a half saltspoonful of pepper. Boil for two minutes, strain 
and serve. 

Fried Cucumbers — Pare them and cut lengthwise in very 
thick slices; wipe them dry with a cloth; sprinkle with salt and 
pepper, dredge with flour and fry in lard and butter, a tablespoon- 
ful of each mixed. Brown both sides and serve warm. 

Lady Cake — Take two and a half scant teacupfuls flour and, 
after sifting well, mix with it one level teaspoonful of baking 
powder and sift again; add one and a half teacupfuls of powdered 
sugar, blended with half a teacupful of butter; beat the whites of 
two eggs to a froth; add gradually to the flour half a teacupful 
of milk, follow with the sugar and the butter, and next the 
whites of the eggs, finishing up with a few drops of the essence 
of almond. Bake in a hot oven for three-quarters of an hour. 

Crystallized Pineapple — Cut a pineapple into thin slices and 
then again into quarters. Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff 
froth; lay the fruit in this, drain and beat again the part that 
drips off. Select the pieces one by one and dip them into finely 
powdered sugar. Cover a pan with a sheet of fine paper, place

Veal Rechauffe — Chop fine enough cold veal from yesterday's 
roast to make one cupful, add to it one cupful of bread crumbs, 
mixing lightly; season with one small teaspoouful of salt and a 
little black pepper; let one cup of milk come to a boil; mix one 
tablespoonful of butter with one tablespoonful of flour thoroughly 
and add to the rnilk, with a tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce 
and a dash of cayenne pepper; cook until thickened, beating well 
to make it smooth; add meat and bread crumbs; mix well and 
put in a baker in a hot oven to brown. Be sure and have the 
mixture very hot before adding the veal and bread crumbs; it 
makes it much lighter. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes — Fry one scant tablespoonful of minced 
onions in one heaping tablespoonful of butter until yellow; add 
one tablespoonful of mild vinegar; put into this one pint of cold 
sliced potatoes, seasoned v/ith one-half teaspoonful of salt, and 
stir with a fork until they have absorbed all the butter, iDeing 
careful not to break them; then add one tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley and serve hot. The heated vinegar gives a delicious flavor 
to the potatoes. 

Rice Bread — Take two large tablespoonfuls of cooked sea- 
soned rice that has been left over and mix with it one cup of 
sweet milk and the beaten yolks of two eggs. Add a generous 



248 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

teaspoonful of melted butter, a pinch of salt, one cup of sifted flour 
in which is one-half a teaspoonful of baking powder. Last of all 
add the beaten whites of the eggs. Bake in buttered tins an inch 
thick. 

Broiled Whitefish — Get a fresh whitefish of two or three 
pounds, clean thoroughly and dry with a cloth. Rub the inside 
of the fish with the juice of half a lemon and a saltspoonful of 
salt and lay on a buttered gridiron inside down over a clear fire. 
When lower side is browned turn the fish. It should be done in 
about twenty minutes. Serve on a hot dish with a tablespoonful 
of butter melted and poured over the fish. 

Cucumber with French Dressing — Peel two good-sized cucum- 
bers and let them lie in ice water for an hour. Then slice them, 
place in a bowl and pour over them a mixture of one tablespoonful 
of vinegar, tv/o tablespoonfuls of olive oil, one-half teaspoonful 
of salt and a dash of cayenne pepper. 

Strawberry Shortcake — One quart of flour, two teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder, a pinch of salt, three tablespoonfuls of butter, 
and milk enough to make a soft dough. Bake in a large pie- 
plate. When cool split with a large knife and insert a generous 
layer of strawberries and granulated sugar. Replace the top 
and cover with strawberries and sugar. Should there be a 
cupful of berries left, mash them, add sugar and a pint of hot 
milk. Serve in a pitcher with shortcake. 

French Mutton Chops Breaded — Take five or six nice rib chops 
(they will weigh about two pounds) and have the butcher 
*'French" them. Pepper and salt the chops and roll them in an 
egg well-beaten. Then roll in fine cracker crumbs and fry brown 
in very hot lard. 

Pineapple Sherbet — Shred a fresh pineapple (the canned 
fruit will answer), add one pint of sugar, one-half pint of water, 
juice of one lemon, and one tablespoonful of gelatine that has 
been soaked for one hour in one cup of cold water, and dissolve 
in one cup of hot water; mix all together well and freeze.

Brewis, Cream and Sugar — Stir into one pint of boiling milk 
one cupful of dried and browned bread crumbs and a pinch of 
salt. Serve immediately. Increase the quantity if needed. 

Breakfast Crackers, Baked — Warm one cup of milk, season 
with half a teaspoon of salt, a dash of pepper and a teaspoonful 
of butter. Split six Boston crackers, pour the milk over them and 
let them soak it all up. Then lay the crackers, crust down, in a 
deep baking-dish. Put a small pinch of salt, a piece of butter 
and a sprinkle of pepper on each one; then lay in the rest of the 
crackers, seasoning in the same way. Beat an egg, mix with 
one cup of milk and pour over the crackers. Bake in a quick oven 
twenty minutes. 

Cuban Eggs — Six eggs, one small teaspoonful of minced 
onion, four teaspoonfuls of minced sausage meat, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, one-eighth of a teaspoonful of pepper. Cook 
meat and onion over hot fire five minutes. Beat the eggs, 
add salt and pepper. Draw the pan back to the cooler part of the 
range and add the eggs. Stir until the eggs become thick and 
creamy; pour into warm dish. Serve on hot buttered toast. 

Asparagus with Eggs — Use two bunches of asparagus, half a 
dozen eggs, three tablespoonfuls of butter and two and a half 
level teaspoonfuls of salt. After cutting off the tough ends wash 
the asparagus, tie it in a bundle and put it in a saucepan with 
enough boiling water to cover it. Boil for twenty-five minutes, 
adding two teaspoonfuls of salt at the end of the first quarter of 
an hour. When done take from fire and drain. Untie the bundle 
and place the asparagus in a baking-dish. Spread half the butter 
on it and set the dish to keep hot. Beat the eggs light and add 
half-teaspoonful of salt and the remainder of the butter, broken 
into bits. Pour this mixture over the asparagus and set dish in a 
moderate oven for four minutes. Serve very hot. 

Pieplant Bird's Nest — Butter a pie-plate well, wash the pie- 
plant, but do not peel; cut in very small pieces and fill the tin 
half full. Make a batter of one cup sour milk, one cup sour cream, 
one egg, one teaspoonful soda, pinch of salt and flour to make 
stiff batter; pour this over the pieplant. Bake one-half hour in 
a quick oven and eat with sweetened cream. This can be made 
of other kinds of fruit. 

Oatmeal Water — Make a very thin gruel by using at the rate 
of one tablespoonful of oatmeal to a quart of water. Boil for an 
hour; strain and let it get very cold. It is an improvement to add 
the juice of a lemon and two tablespoonfuls of sugar to each quart. 

Sorrel Soup— This palatable spring soup requires a quart of 



250 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

sorrel, three tablespoonfuls of butter, two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
a teaspoonful and a half of salt, a quarter of a teaspoonful of 
pepper, a teaspoonful of sugar, half an onion, half a cupful of 
water, a pint of milk and a pint of cream. After washing the 
sorrel put it into a stew-pan with the cold water and boil 
ten minutes; drain and chop the sorrel very fine; cut 
the onion into bits, cook it slowly in the butter in 
a frying-pan for five minutes, then add the flour, and 
stir until smooth and frothy; add the chopped sorrel, sugar, salt 
and pepper, and, after stirring for three minutes, gradually pour 
in the cold milk; simmer for five minutes and heat the cream to 
the boiling point; strain the soup; add the cream to it. Serve 
immediately. Milk may be substituted for the cream, or a pint 
of white stock. If liked, the yolks of two eggs, beaten with two 
tablespoonfuls of milk, can be added, pouring the soup upon this 
mixture just before serving time. Do not stir the eggs into the 
soup, because they would then be cooked in flakes, whereas by 
the other way they are cooked to a smooth cream. Sorrel soup 
is not as handsome as some green soups, because the heat spoils 
the color, but it is delicious. 

Bscalloped Calves' Brains — Two sets of brains are required, 
a pint of grated bread crumbs, half a pint of milk, an egg, a tea- 
spoonful of butter, half-teaspoonful of chopped parsley, half a tea- 
spoonful of onion juice, one teaspoonful of salt, a grain of pep- 
per, and a tablespoonful of vinegar. After soaking the brains in 
warm water for two hours, free them from the skin and large 
fibres and wash them in cold water. Tie them loosely in a piece 
of thin muslin and, putting them in a sauce-pan, pour in enough 
boiling water to cover them. Add the spoonful of vinegar and 
then boil gently for half an hour. At the end of that time take 
them from the boiling water and plunge them into cold water. 
When they are cold drain them and cut into small pieces. Heat 
the butter in a small frying-pan and before it turns brown add 
the flour. Stir until smooth and gradually add the milk. When 
this boils up add the chopped parsley, onion juice and half the 
pepper and salt. Sprinkle the remainder of the seasoning on the 
brains. Beat the egg light and mix it with the brains. Put a 
thin layer of crumbs on the bottom of an escallop dish, spread 
on these half the quantity of brains, next a layer of half the 
sauce, then a thin layer of crumbs. Add a second layer of brains, 
sauce and crumbs. Bake in a moderate oven twenty minutes. 

Wax Beans — Take two quarts of wax beans, string them, if 
necessary, and then with a sharp knife cut each pod into longi- 
tudinal strips as thin as a shaving. Put into boiling water, add 
a teaspoonful salt and boil furiously fifteen or twenty minutes. 
When cooked tender drain and add a half-cup of cream, half tea- 
spoonful salt and a dash of pepper. Boil up once and serve hot. 
The beans are enough nicer prepared this way to pay for the 
extra work of splitting them. 

Strawberry Tapioca with Sauce — Soak over night a teacupful 
of tapioca in cold water; in the morning put half of it in a bak- 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 251 

ing-dish. Sprinkle half a cup of sugar over the tapioca, put on 
this a quart of berries (reserving twelve for the sauce), half-cup 
of sugar and the rest of the tapioca. Fill the dish with water, 
which should cover the tapioca a quarter of an inch. Bake in a 
moderately hot oven until it looks clear. Serve cold with — 

Strawberry Sauce — Beat two ounces of butter to a cream, add- 
ing gradually a half-cupful of powdered sugar, then add twelve 
large strawberries, mash and beat till light.

DINNER. 

Bran soup. 

Broiled shad. Lettuce salad. 

Stewed peas. 

Tutti frutti. Thumb cake. 



Bacon on Toast — Slice breakfast bacon very thin, put each 
slice on a square of stale light bread, place in a baking-pan and 
into a hot oven, first on the bottom to brown the under side of 
the bread, and then on the grate above to toast the bacon and 
upper side of the bread. Serve as soon as brown. Very appe- 
tizing if carefully done. 

Cracknels — Warm two cups of milk — half water will do — add 
four tablespoons of butter or lard, or a mixture of the two, one 
gill of yeast, one-half teaspoon of salt. Mix into dough with suffi- 
cient flour for milk to wet, let rise and then roll very thin, and 
cut into long strips three inches wide, prick well with a fork and 
bake in a slow oven. 

Strawberry Pyramid — Cook a pint of rice; place a layer of it, 
well seasoned with a tablespoon of butter and a half-teaspoon of 
salt, on a pretty plate, decorated on the edge, if possible, with 
small strawberry leaves. Cover the rice with strawberries, 
sprinkled lightly with sugar, then a layer of the rice, and so on, 
forming the pile into the shape of a pyramid. Finish the top 
with a spray of the berries. 



252 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Russian Tea — Fill each glass half full of cracked ice, add 
a slice of lemon and two cubes of white sugar. Fill up with 
cold tea. 

Bran Soup — This summer soup is made without meat by boil- 
ing one cup of bran in six cups of water slowly for 
three hours. Strain this stock and to one quart of it add one 
sliced onion and three tablespoons of rice, one teaspoon of salt, 
and just before serving, a saltspoon of celery salt, one-fourth tea- 
spoon of white pepper, one teaspoon of chopped parsley. This in- 
expensive soup contains much of the nutritive properties of meat. 
It may be varied by adding tomatoes, potatoes or other vegeta- 
bles instead of rice. 

Broiled Shad — Split the fish down the back and lay on a flat 
dish for an hour in a marionade of one tablespoon of oil and one 
of vinegar, a teaspoon of salt and a half one of white pepper. 
Rub the bars of a double gridiron with beef suet, lay on the fish 
and broil over a clear, slow fire, putting inside to the fire first. 
When done remove to a hot dish and dress with a tablespoon of 
butter, one of lemon juice and one of finely minced parsley. 

Tutti Frutti — Two oranges sliced, two sliced bananas and one 
box of strawberries arranged in layers and sprinkled with half a 
cup of sugar. 

Thumb Cake — One cup of sugar, butter the size of the thumb, 
yolks of two eggs, one-half cup of water, one teaspoon baking 
powder in one and a half cups of flour, one-eighth of a teaspoon 
of grated nutmeg. Bake in moderate oven.

Scrambled Eggs with Asparagus Tips — Beat six eggs light 
with two tablespoons of cream, scramble in butter, and when 
set, sprinkle w^ith a small half-teaspoonful of salt; stir in lightly 
the tender portion of one bunch of asparagus, cut in inch lengths, 
add a dash of pepper, and dish on toast. 

Potatoes Chateaubriand — Peel one quart new potatoes size of 
walnuts, quite round; cook in covered vessel with three ounces 
butter till done (about twenty minutes). Shake occasionally to 
prevent sticking; sprinkle with one teaspoonful of salt and 
chopped parsley. 

Pish salad — Boil one pound of any kind of firm fresh fish (cod 
or red snapper is preferable), cooked in acidulated, salted water, 
in which an onion has been sliced. When done and cold remove 
skin and bones; flake, and add an equal quantity of shredded let- 
tuce; two hard-boiled eggs, chopped; two pickled gherkins, 
sliced; toss with French dressing made with equal quantities of 
oil and vinegar; dress high on the dish; surround the base with 
sixths of hard-boiled egg cut lengthwise, alternating with the 
slices of half a lemon; squeeze the remainder of the lemon over 
and serve. 

Cucumber Vinaigrette — Place thin slices of cucumbers on a 
lettuce leaf in individual dishes, over each a tablespoonful of 
sauce vinaigrette — four tablespoonfuls of oil, two of vinegar and 
two of minced pickles; one large or two medium-sized green 
onions, chopped fine; a saltspoon of salt, two of mustard, and 
one-half spoonful white pepper; mix thoroughly. 

Puree Clamart — Take the unused part of asparagus left from 
breakfast, one can marrowfat peas, one small onion, two potatoes 
and pint of water; boil slowly until all ingredients are quite done 
(nearly an hour), then rub through a sieve or fine strainer. If 
too thick, dilute with milk; season with one-half teaspoon salt 
and a half saltspoon of pepper. Stir in two ounces butter and 
three egg yolks; do not let it boil after adding eggs. Serve with 
one cup of small cubes of bread dried in the oven. 

Creole Sauce — Cook the steaks to taste, pour over the follow- 
ing: Fry until a light yellow color in one ounce butter, one clove 
of garlic, two medium-sized onions, minced, and one tablespoon- 
ful of minced ham; add one teaspoonful of flour and cook one 
minute longer; then add half-can tomatoes (retaining the more 
solid portion), one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful sugar, 
a little cayenne or a small red pepper pod, minced, one-third cup 
vinegar; cook fifteen minutes and garnish with twenty small po- 
tatoes Chateaubriand left from breakfast. 

Spaghetti, Italian Style — Boil half-pound spaghetti twenty 
minutes in salted water; cool and drain; make pint and half of 
tomato sauce with the balance of the can previously used, using 
two cloves' of garlic and one onion, minced. Pour over the spa- 
ghetti;, add one ounce of fat salt pork, minced or scraped and 
partially fried; third of cup of grated cheese; cover closely and 
cook very slowly for almost an hour.

Pieplant Sauce — In cooking pieplant do not strip off the pink 
skin, as it gives flavor and color to the sauce. Cook slowly, sugar 
to taste, and just before removing from the stove add three or 
four thin slices of lemon and a teaspoonful of butter. 

Minced Meat on Toast — One pint of finely minced meats, one 
tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful of flour, one small cup 
of soup-stock or water, two-thirds of a teaspoonful salt, one-half 
saltspoonful pepper, one-third saltspoonful nutmeg, one-third 
saltspoonful ginger. Put the butter in a frying-pan and when 
melted and slightly browned add flour. Stir to a smooth paste, 
adding stock (or water) and seasoning. Lastly add the meat, al- 
lowing it to cook slowly for about ten minutes. Serve on slices 
of crisp toast, with a soft-poached egg on each slice. Any cold 
meat will do for the above; if veal, add a little lemon peel to sea- 
soning; if pork, add a little powdered sage. Baker's bread is 
best for toast and should be toasted very slowly, so it may be

dried through and through while taking on a golden brown 
color outside. 

Cold Boiled Potatoes Pried Whole — Cold potatoes (boiled) 
fried whole in beef drippings or suet fat (buy that around the 
kidneys and try it out like lard) are quite as nice as the "browned 
potatoes" cooked in the pan with roast beef. 

Wheat Griddle Cakes, Sirup — There is a special art in making 
good griddle cakes, and once learned people need never have poor 
ones. The following is a never-failing recipe: One and one-half 
pints of milk, two coffeecups of sifted flour, three eggs, one-half 
teaspoonful salt, two rather heaping teaspoonfuls baking powder. 
Beat the yolks of the eggs well and add to them the milk, mixing 
together thoroughly. Put the flour in a bowl and pour on part of 
the milk. Now beat this thick batter briskly for three or four 
minutes (to aerate it), put the baking powder in the remaining 
milk, mix and add to the batter, and lastly add the beaten whites 
of eggs. This batter will answer equally well for waffles. The 
thinner the batter the more delicate the cake or waffle. 

Soyer's Eggs — Slice two or three large onions very thin and 
fry till a nice brown. Have ready five or six hard-boiled eggs 
(boiled thirty minutes they are perfectly digestible), cut in slices, 
and a half-bowl of good gravy. Add first the gravy, then the 
eggs, stirring gently to blend (do not break the eggs), cook a min- 
ute or two and serve very hot. Season the onions with pepper 
and salt. 

Cold Asparagus Salad — Left over from dinner, makes a de- 
licious salad for luncheon with ordinary French dressing; or, 
better still, a little mayonnaise. 

Warren Gingerbread — Good gingerbread can only be made of 
the dark New Orleans or Porto Rico molasses. The following is 
a Dixie recipe and infallible: One-half cup butter, warmed till 
soft; one and one-half cups molasses, three-fourths cup boiling 
water, three level cups sifted flour, one slightly heaping teaspoon- 
ful of soda, one and one-half heaping teaspoonfuls ginger, one 
and one-half teaspoonfuls cinnamon, one saltspoonful cloves, one 
saltspoonful nutmeg and a pinch of salt. Put molasses in one 
bowl and add melted butter, spices and soda. When thoroughly 
mixed together add the boiling water, then the flour, beating un- 
til all lumps are gone. Bake in moderate oven. As anything 
made with molasses burns easily, the pan must be lined with thick 
double paper, or, the easiest method is to use two pans, the same 
size, putting one inside the other. 

Stuffed Veal — Get the shoulder and have the bone removed, 
leaving a "pocket" for the stuffing. Make the stuffing of a pint 
and a half of dry bread crumbs moistened with a few teaspoon- 
fuls of milk and two of melted butter. Season with one-half tea- 
spoonful salt, two dashes of pepper, a little sage and the grated 
rind of one-fourth of a lemon. Now put the stuffing in the pocket 
and sew or tie up securely. Rub the meat over with lemon, 
dredge well with flour, into which a little seasoning of salt, pep- 
per and a little ginger has been sprinkled. Put the roast into 



256 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

a good hot oven, and leave it uncovered until the flour is a light 
brown (there must be flour also in the bottom of the pan), and 
then pour over it nearly a pint of boiling soup stock or hot water. 
Cover closely and cook more slowly for two hours — basting fre- 
quently and renewing the water if necessary. When the roast is 
removed, there will be good material in the pan for a nice 
brown gravy. If necessary, add more flour, let it brown (on 
top of the stove), and add water or stock, salt and pepper. Strain 
and serve. Any veal left over, with the dressing, will make 
excellent croquettes. 

Cauliflower with Dressing — Nearly all cook books give "twen- 
ty minutes" as the proper time for cooking cauliflower. Cooked 
a full hour it is a different vegetable, and tried once you will 
never cook it a shorter time. Tie it in a clean white cloth. Put 
it on in cold salted water (stem up) in a graniteware or porce- 
lain-lined saucepan — never in iron or tin. When done place 
it (flowers up) in a hot platter and pour over it the following 
sauce: Rub together a tablespoonful of butter and flour to a 
smooth paste, add gradually a cup and a half of the water 
in which the cauliflower was boiled. Let this boil for two or three 
minutes, seasoning with salt and pepper, and just before serv- 
ing add the well-beaten yolk of an egg, mixed with a tablespoon- 
ful of cold water to prevent curdling. This is also the best sauce 
for asparagus, using the water in which the vegetable is boiled. 

Mashed Potatoes — The "greenest" girl will be indignant if her 
ability to prepare a dish of mashed potatoes is questioned, while, 
in truth, very few trained cooks make the dish to perfection. 
First put on the potatoes in cold, salted water, and cook till done, 
drain, and return to stove to dry. Next put them through a "po- 
tato press" (they only cost 15 cents), and you are then ready 
to make really fine mashed potatoes. For a pint and a half of 
potatoes put on a tumbler of milk to heat, adding salt and a lump 
of butter. Before the boiling point is reached pour over the po- 
tatoes and beat hard for two or three minutes. They will be 
white as snow, and will melt in your mouth, literally. 

Strawberry Sherbet — Every family can have sherbets as often 
as they wish during the warm months. They are cheap, whole- 
some, not troublesome to make and delicious. For strawberry 
sherbet get two quarts of berries — the small, cheaper ones are 
just as good for the purpose as larger ones, if sound. When 
culled and washed sprinkle with sugar, about a coffeecupful. Put 
them over a very slow heat (use a graniteware vessel), let- 
ting them come very gradually to a boil. When you think all 
the juice has been set free drain through a jelly bag; there should 
be nearly a quart of juice, to which add nearly a pint of water 
and the beaten whites of two eggs. Put in your freezer and 
freeze, which process should take not more than fifteen or twen- 
ty minutes. In freezing sherbets or ice cream use one-third 
salt to two-thirds ice. The easiest way to break the ice is to put 
it In a coarse bag and pound with the broad part of a heavy flat- 
iron or the flat of a hatchet. When your sherbet is frozen take 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 257 

out the paddle, put a cork in the top of the freezer, drain most 
of the water from the pall, cover with more ice and salt, press it 
down with a stick and let stand till ready to use. All fruits nearly 
are good for sherbets, and in the autumn grape juice is excellent 
for the purpose — indeed, many think it best of all.

pieces' enough to fill a pint cup; sprinkle it with salt, add a tea- 
spoonful of celery seed, some black pepper, two cold mashed po- 
tatoes, and a third of a cup of milk. Grate enough cold bread to 
fill a large cup, and beat an egg thoroughly. Mix the meat with 
the hands, form into balls, roll in the egg, then in the bread 
crumbs and fry an even brown in hot lard. Lay on green leaves 
and serve hot. 

Cold Tongue, Rhubarb Jelly — On each piece of sliced tongue 
put a spoonful of rhubarb jelly made as follows: Cut up and wash 
the rhubarb and put on to boil with a little water. Let boil brisk- 
ly, take off and strain through flannel bag, measure and put back 
to boil. Allow it to boil low, then add three-fourths as much 
sugar as juice. Boil hard for a few minutes, then turn into glass- 
es and put in the sun. It should be a golden yellow. 

White Soup — Quart of sv/eet milk, pint of cold water, large 
tablespoon of butter; two mashed potatoes, a small onion, two 
tablespoons tapioca. Let all boil before adding tapioca, which 
should be soaked in a little milk, then boil all together, adding

spoonfuls of cream, two tablespoonfuls of stock, one small, level 
teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of white pepper; stir the 
whole until the eggs begin to thicken, then take from the fire 
and with a Dover egg beater beat them until they are light and 
delicate, then return the saucepan to the fire and as soon as the 
eggs are hot pour them into a warm dish and serve at once. These 
are delicious if carefully made. 

Cream Toast — Put in the double boiler one quart of milk, then 
cut even slices of stale bread and toast them a nice brown on 
each side. Dip each toasted slice into the hot milk a moment, 
then place it in the serving dish. When all are done add half a 
pint of milk to the hot milk, put in a large tablespoonful of but- 
ter and three-quarters of a teaspoonful of salt. Beat the yolk 
of one egg, add to it one small tablespoonful of flour and two 
tablespoonfuls of cold milk. Mix together until smooth and stir 
it into the boiling milk. Let it boil until it is creamy, stirring it 
all the while. Then put it into the dish with the toast, lifting up 
the slices carefully so the cream will be at the bottom of the 
dish and all around the toast. Fill the dish nearly full of the 
cream, and if there is any left put that in a bowl, and send all to 
the table very hot. 

Cottage-Cheese Sandwiches — Take nice white bread and pre- 
pare it as for any sandwich, butter smoothly, then spread v/ith a 
seasoned layer of cottage cheese through which small bits of the 
spicy watercress are plentifully scattered; place another buttered 
slice on top, cut them in strips or any shape desired. Arrange on 
a nice plate on a folded napkin and serve. 

Hominy and Meat Croquettes — Boil the hominy the day be- 
fore; make the croquettes in the morning. Put half a cupful of 
milk into a saucepan; when boiling hot stir into it two large 
tablespoons of butter, one cupful of boiled hominy, one cupful 
of finely chopped meat, one-half teaspoon of salt and a saltspoon 
of pepper. Mix ail thoroughly; when it begins to boil add one 
well-beaten egg, cook two minutes and pour the mixture out to 
cool. When cold form into small cylinder croquettes, dip in 
egg, then in fine bread crumbs, place them on a board sprinkled 
over with crumbs and keep in a cool place until ready to- fry. 
Then carefully place them in a frying basket, being careful not to 
crowd them; fry a light brown and serve very hot. 

Lemon Sherbet — Take one teaspoonful of gelatine, soak it 
one hour in enough cold \yater to cover it, then add one cupful of 



262 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

boiling hot water and stir until dissolved. Tlie juice of six lemons, 
one good pint of granulated sugar and one quart of cold water. 
Mix together the sugar, lemon juice, water and gelatine; strain it 
into the can and freeze. 

Terrapin Veal— Two pounds of veal cut into small pieces, two 
tablespoons of melted butter and half a tablespoon of grated 
onion. Cook slowly five minutes, then add the meat and cook un- 
til it browns, stirring often. Thicken with one heaping table- 
spoon of flour and add slowly a cup of hot stock, one tablespoon 
of mushroom catchup, a heaping teaspoon of salt, a saltspoon oi 
pepper; simmer two hours. Then add one cup of cream, three 
hard-boiled eggs chopped fine and a teaspoon of lemon juice. 

Serve hot. 

Strawberry Sponge — One quart of berries, one-half box of gel- 
atine, one and one-half cups water, one cup sugar, juice of one 
lemon, beaten whites of four eggs. Soak gelatine in one-half 
cup of the water; mash the berries and add the sugar to them; 
boil the remainder of sugar and the cup of water gently twenty 
minutes; rub berries through a hair sieve; add gelatine to boil- 
ing sirup; take from the fire and add berry juice; place bowl 
in pan of ice v/ater and beat v/ith egg beater five min- 
utes; add beaten whites and beat till it begins to thicken. Pour 
into iwell-wet molds and set on ice.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 263 

then in powdered sugar. These snowy balls are then arranged 
in a glass dish and decorated with strawberry leaves. 

Whipped Eggs — Beat six eggs till light and pour into two 
quarts of fast-boiling salted water. Stir vigorously for two min- 
utes, drain in a fine sieve, turn out on a hot platter and gar- 
nish with crisp bacon. This may also be served on buttered 
toast. 

Peas in Cases — New peas may be daintily served in cases 
made of mashed potatoes. Mash the potatoes nicely, stiffen the 
mass by adding flour, season with salt and pepper and bake it 
in fluted cake tins, placing a bit of bread in the center of each 
to keep the cases in shape and removing it as soon as all the shell 
is baked. Then prepare the peas in the following manner: Cook 
a pint of shelled peas in just as much water as will keep them 
from burning. Do not cover the kettle while cooking any green 
vegetable, as the confined steam will always change the color 
to a yellowish shade of green. When the peas are tender add a 
tablespoonful of flour, into which has been rubbed a tablespoonful 
of butter; as soon as the liquor has been thickened by this paste 
season with a saltspoon of salt and a dash of pepper, pour into 
the cases and serve hot. 

Cheese Sandwiches — Cut brown bread into very thin slices, 
buttering lightly. Lay between two of these slices, sandwich 
fashion, a filling made of cream cheese or cottage cheese in which 
has been mixed chopped olives. These sandwiches are new and 
delicious. 

Rice with Strawberry Dressing — Pour two cupfuls of boiling 
water on one cupful of well-washed rice; add one teaspoonful of 
salt; cook in double boiler thirty minutes. Add a pint or more 
of milk and a heaping tablespoonful of butter. Boil until per- 
fectly tender and not too dry. Pour into a dish and let stand 
until cold. Dressing: One cupful of powdered sugar, one table- 
spoonful of butter; beat to a cream; one cupful fresh, ripe straw- 
berries. Put in the last the well-beaten white of an egg. In serv- 
ing put into each saucer some rice and on the rice place a liberal 
portion of the dressing. Delicious. 

Lady Fingers — Two eggs, one-half cupful flour, scant half 
cupful of powdered sugar. Have the bottom of two baking pans 
lined with buttered paper. Beat the yolks of the eggs and the 
sugar to a froth. Beat the whites to a stiff, dry froth and add 
to the yolks and sugar; flavor with a few drops of vanilla; add the 
flour and mix carefully and quickly. Pour the mixture into the 
pastry bag and press it through on the paper any size you wish. 
Sprinkle powdered sugar over and bake sixteen minutes in a slow 
oven. 

Baked Halibut Steaks — Trim the stakes, lay them in a roast- 
ing-pan, and for two pounds use one cup of cream or milk, one 
teaspoonful of flour, one tablespoon of butter, one teaspoon 
of salt, and a saltspoon of pepper. Dredge the steaks with 
the flour. Add the seasoning and dot with the butter; then 
pour over the cream, and bake fifteen minutes in a quick oven; 



264 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

garnish with parsley and serve with lemon. These are delicious. 
Fresh cod may be treated in the same way, and if any is left it 
will make an excellent scallop. 

New Potatoes — Wash and scrub well, but do not peel. Put 
into boiling salted water, enough to cover two inches, and cook 
rapidly for fifteen to twenty minutes. Pour off all the water, and 
if the potatoes are not quite tender set them in a hot place, cov- 
ered, to steam until they are. When they are done sprinkle 
with salt, shake them till the skins crack, and serve in a folded 
napkin. The attractive appearance of a dish predisposes one to 
like its contents. 

Sunshine Cake — Eleven whites of eggs, six yolks of eggs, one 
teaspoon cream of tartar, one and one-half cups sifted granu- 
lated sugar, one cup flour, the grated peel of one orange. Beat 
whites till stiff and flaky, then whisk in one-half the sugar; beat 
the yolks very light and add flavoring and the other half of the 
sugar; put yolks and whites together and add flour and cream of 
tartar, mixing as quickly as possible. Bake fifty to sixty min- 
utes in a slow oven, using angel-cake pan.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 265 

Rice — After thoroughly washing and rubbing one cup of rice 
put it into boiling water, enough to cover it twice over, in a cus- 
tard kettle; add half a teaspoonful of salt, cook for fifteen min- 
utes, then pour off water, add half a cup of rich milk and allow 
it to cook half an hour longer. 

Ham Balls — Chop fine pieces of cold cooked ham. Add four 
tablespoonfuls of stale bread crumbs to one-half cup of milk, 
stir and cook until thick, add yolks of two eggs, take from the 
fire and add one cup of chopped ham, one-half saltspoon of pepper 
and one teaspoonful of chopped parsley; mix and stand away to 
cool (may be prepared the day before). When cold form into 
balls, dip into the beaten whites of the eggs, then in bread crumbs 
and fry in smoking-hot fat. Serve very hot and garnished with 
sprigs of parsley. 

Breakfast Rolls — Two quarts of sifted fiour, one pint of milk, 
two tablespoonfuls butter or lard, one tablespoon sugar, one tea- 
spoonful salt, half a cake compressed yeast. Put the fiour into a 
bread pan, pour into it the milk (which must be boiled and then 
cooled), add the butter, salt, sugar and yeast; knead and let rise 
over night. Cut off pieces and carefully shape into rolls the de- 
sired size by rolling between the hands, but do not knead them. 
Set in a warm place and they will quickly rise ready for baking. 

Egg Salad — Eight hard-boiled eggs, four crackers rolled fine, 
one-half cup vinegar, one teaspoon each of mustard, celery seed 
and salt, one saltspoonful of pepper and one tablespoonful of 
butter. Separate eggs and chop fine each part, heat the vinegar 
with the butter and pour over the eggs; then add crackers and 
spices. Mix lightly and garnish with lettuce. 

Strawberry Shortcake — Sift three cupfuls of flour, two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder, one pinch of salt and one table- 
spoonful of sugar together four times, then rub into the mixture 
one-half cup of butter and lastly add one-half cup of sweet milk, 
mixing as quickly and lightly as possible with a spoon. Bake in 
three layers in a very quick oven. When done place one layer on a 
plate, butter well with good sv/eet butter, cover plentifully with 
berries and sugar. Place layer upon layer, treating each in the 
same manner, reserving the finest and largest berries for the 
top layer, which should be dusted over with pov/dered sugar. 
Serve with cream and sugar. 

Tomato Sauce — Put one tablespoonful of butter in a frying 
pan; when melted add one tablespoonful of flour, mix and add 
half a pint of strained stewed tomatoes (canned tomatoes answer 
as well as fresh ones), stir until it boils, add a teaspoonful of 
grated onions, a half-teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of 
pepper. 

Potato Souffle — Steam six large potatoes; when done peel and 
mash; add a tablespoonful of butter, half a pint of hot milk, one 
teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of white pepper; beat un- 
til very light and perfectly smooth. Froth the white of an egg, 
stir it gently in with the potatoes, heap on a dish and set in a 
quick oven to brown. 



266 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Banana Pudding — Put one pint of milk over the fire in a cus- 
tard kettle. Beat two eggs with three-fourths of a cupful of sugar 
Into which has been mixed one teaspoonful of cornstarch. Stir 
this mixture into the boiling milk, and when it thickens remove 
from fire and add the juice of half a lemon. Cut stale cake in 
thin slices and line a dish with the slices. Cover the cake with 
banana sliced thin, and over this pour a cupful of the custard. 
Then add another layer of cake and banana, and over all pour 
the remainder of the custard. Set on ice and let get very cold. 
Just before serving cover with a cupful of whipped cream.

water over night. Roll each slice in flour and fry crisp and 
brown in hot lard. After that, dip each slice in beaten egg and 
roll in bread crumbs and return for a few moments to the hot fat. 
A good relish. 

Colonial Pancakes — All that is needed to make delicate pan- 
cakes is sour milk, soda, salt and flour. Into one pint sour milk 
beat one pint flour and one-half teaspoonful salt. Success de- 
pends upon the thoroughness with which this is done. If beaten 
sufficiently the mass will be bubbling before the soda is added. 
Just before baking stir into the mixture one-half teaspoonful soda 
dissolved In one-half cupful sweet milk. 



THE CHIC AGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 267 

Meat Salad with Domestic Dressing — One and one-half cup- 
fuls chopped cold veal. One head of celery or one cupful chopped 
cabbage or the solid heart and stems of lettuce. Use celery salt 
with the cabbage and lettuce. Mix and pour over it a dressing 
made as follows: Into the yelks of two eggs beat one teaspoon- 
ful salt and one of mustard. Stir in two-thirds cupful vinegar 
and heat to near boiling, stirring all the time. When cold add 
two tablespoonfuls thick sweet or sour cream. 

Cherry Tart — One teacupfui stoned cherries. One cupful 
sugar. One tablespoonful f.our, and one egg beaten very light. 
Mix and fill a pie-tin v/hich has been lined with crust. Cross nar- 
row strips of the crust over the top. Excellent recipe for any 
kind of fruit. 

Summer Soup — One large onion, one large carrot, two tur- 
nips, one-half small head cabbage, one-half bunch celery, one 
teacupfui stewed tomatoes. Chop very finely all the vegetables 
except the tomatoes and cabbage and set them over the fire with 
three pints water. They should simmer gently for half an hour, 
when the cabbage should be added, having previousl:/ been par- 
boiled and chopped. In fifteen minutes more put in the tomatoes 
and a bunch of sweet herbs and give all a lively boil for tv/enty 
.minutes. Rub through a colander and return to the fire. ' Stir 
in a good tablespoonful of butter, half a cupful of cream with a 
tablespoonful of cornstarch, and a teaspoonful of salt and quar- 
ter-teaspoonful pepper. Let it boil up and serve. 

Frozen Pineapple Custard — One pint of milk and three eggs. 
Beat the yolks with one small cup sugar and stir into the milk, 
then heat it to nearly the boiling point, stirring ail the time. 
When cold add one cupful sweet cream and the beaten v/hites of 
the eggs. Place in the freezer and turn till almost solid, then 
stir in one small pineapple which has been chopped and had one 
cupful of sugar sifted over it for three hours. Every family 
should have a freezer, for frozen custards are delicious and inex- 
pensive. 

Geranium Cake — Stir one-half teacupfui butter to a cream 
with one cup sugar; add, by degrees, two-thirds cupful water and 
two cupfuls flour which have been sifted with one teaspoonful 
baking powder; then fold in the stiffly-beaten v/hites of four 
eggs. Line a square tin with oiled paper, over which place a 
layer of rose-geranium leaves. Pour the cake mixture over the 
leaves and bake. The result will be a delicate flavor difficult to 
imitate, and the leaves pull off readily without leaving any trace. 

If frosting is desired make as follows: Boil one-third teacup- 
fui water and one teacupfui sugar ten minutes, or till it hardens 
in cold water; then add three tablespoonfuls cream and beat till 
cool. Mrs. L. T. Hunter.

MONPAY, JUNE THE FOURTEENTH. 



BREAKFAST. 

Iced clierries. 

Broiled breakfast bacon. 

Johnny cake. Coffee. 



LUNCHEON. 

Tomato bisque with croutons. 

Bread and butter. Lettuce salad. 

Cocoanut cake. Tea. 

DINNER. 

Roast beef and Yorkshire pudding. 

Browned potatoes. 

Radishes. Peas. 

Gooseberry tart. Coffee. 



Iced Cherries — Wipe the cherries carefully with a soft cloth. 
Place in ice box over night. Serve in a pretty glass bowl with' 
cracked ice. 

If the butter for breakfast and luncheon is made into pretty 
rolls with butter pats, then laid on a lettuce leaf with some 
cracked ice, it looks much more appetizing and dainty. Or the 
butter-dish can be garnished with a sprig of parsley and some ice. 

Tomato Bisque — Put half a can of tomatoes in a pot, add half- 
cup water and a small slice of onion. Let simmer slowly for fif- 
teen minutes. Press through a colander, return to pot; add a 
pinch of baking soda. Have a pint of milk (or a little more if 
wanted) at scalding point; pour slowly into the tomato, stirring 
briskly. Add pepper and salt to taste, a teaspoon of butter and 
two tablespoons of well-boiled rice. Let simmer for three or four 
minutes; serve in hot tureen. The rice makes the soup just thick 
enough. Add the croutons the last thing. 

Croutons — Take a slice of bread half an inch thick and cut 
into small squares. Have a teaspoon of butter in frying-pan. 
When hot and frothy add the bread and toss in pan until each 
piece is browned equally. Croutons make a great addition to the 
soup. 

Cocoanut Cake — This recipe makes a very light and delicious 
cake, and is very economical. Take two scant tablespoons but- 
ter and half a cup of sugar and smooth to a cream. Use two eggs, 
putting aside the v/hite of one for the frosting. Beat the rest to- 
gether very light, add to the butter and sugar. Then add one- 
half cup milk, one cup flour, three-fourths teaspoon baking pow- 
der, one-fourth teaspoon vanilla. This quantity makes a two- 
layer cake. Bake ten or twelve minutes in hot oven. Beat the 
white of egg for frosting very stiff, add two teaspoons powdered 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 269 

sugar and a few drops of vanilla. Spread over one layer with 
half of this and sprinkle with prepared cocoanut or fresh-grated 
cocoanut. Then add the other layer and treat same way. Re- 
turn to oven for about a minute to set the frosting. This makes 
a cake large enough for tv/o meals. 

Roast Beef and Yorkshire Pudding — Have the beef rolled 
and save the bones for soup. Rub well with mustard and salt. 
Set the roast in the pan on a meat rest and baste constantly v/ith 
the hot dripping. About half an hour before serving put in the 
potatoes and baste quickly; then pour the batter for Yorkshire 
pudding under the meat so that the gravy can drop in it. To make 
the batter, take one egg, one-half cup milk, pinch of salt and flour 
enough to make a thin batter. When cooked cut in squares and 
serve on platter v/ith roast. 

Gooseberry Tart — Preserve a pint of gooseberries. Line a 
pie-plate v>^ith a rich crust. Then add a border of the paste about 
an inch v/ide. Press down lightly with a fork. Add the goose- 
berries and cross the tart with three narrow twisted strips of 
paste. Moisten the strips with a drop of water at each end to 
make them adhere to the border of the tart. Cook about twenty 
minutes in hot oven. This should be served very cold, and is 
delicious v/ith the addition of whipped cream.

orange flower water. Put the oatmeal in cold water enough to 
cover it and let it steep a day and a night; then pour it off clear 



270 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

and add as much more water, and let it stand the same time. 
Strain it through a fine sieve, add the salt, and boil it till it be- 
comes as thick as hasty pudding, stirring it v/ell all the time. 
Add the sugar and flower water, pour into shallow dishes and 
serve to eat with, milk or sugar. 

Tomato Omelet — One tomato, three eggs, a piece of shalot, 
one and one-half ounces of butter; skin the tomato, cut it up into 
small pieces, add the piece of shalot chopped up; take the eggs 
and beat the yolks and whites separately; mix the tomato, shalot 
and just a dash of pepper and quarter-teaspoonful of salt with 
the yolks. Put the butter into the omelet-pan and make it quite 
hot, then stir the whipped whites lightly into the yolks; put the 
mixture into the omelet-pan and cook for about three minutes, 
stirring all the time. 

Creamed Potatoes — Make a cream sauce of one tablespoonful 
of butter, one tablespoonful of flour, one-half pint of milk, one- 
quarter teaspoonful of salt. Rub the butter and flour together 
until smooth and add it to the milk when boiling. When creamy 
add the salt. Cut four cold boiled potatoes into small blocks, 
place them in a baking-dish and cover with the cream sauce. 
Sprinkle over a thin layer of bread crumbs and bake until a nice 
brown. 

Rice Buns — Two ounces of flour, four ounces of ground rice, 
four ounces of sugar, two ounces of butter, two eggs, one-half 
teaspoon of good baking powder, a pinch of salt. Cream the 
sugar and butter, add half the flour and one egg, then the remain- 
der of the flour, egg and baking powder (be sure to mix the flour 
and ground rice together while it is in its dry state), grease some 
patty or gem-pans, and fill them tvv'^o-thirds full with the mix- 
ture; bake them for fifteen minutes. Enough to make buns for 
two luncheons and very good when kept in closed tin from the air. 

Gooseberry Pool — Pick one quart of young gooseberries and 
put them into a jar with very little water and plenty of sugar; 
put the jar into a sauce-pan of boiling water till the fruit be- 
comes quite tender, then press it through a colander, and add one 
quart of cream or rich milk (be sure to stir in the cream or milk 
very gradually so that it will not curdle), pour into small glasses 
and set in a very cool place till v^^anted. The amount of sugar 
must be according to one's liking. (This is good.) 

Potage k la Bonne Pemme — Two small lettuces, two leaves of 
sorrel, four sprigs of tarragon, one cucumber, one ounce of but- 
ter, one teaspoon of white sugar, one-half teaspoon of salt, one 
pint and a half of thin white stock or water that meat has been 
boiled in, yolks of three eggs, one gill of milk, the crust of a 
French roll. Wash the lettuce, sorrel, tarragon and shred them 
all finely. Peel the cucumber, cut into thin slices and shred them 
also. Melt the butter in a stew-pan, place in the shredded vege- 
tables and herbs and cook them for five minutes, but do not let 
them discolor. Sprinkle over the salt and sugar, add the stock 
and let the vegetables boil slowly until tender. Beat the eggs and 
milk together; take the stew-pan containing the soup off the fire 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 271 

and let it cool, then strain in the eggs and milk; place the stew- 
pan on the fire and stir until the eggs are cooked. Put the crust 
of a French roll in the oven to dry for a few minutes, then cut it 
into small, round pieces. Put these into the tureen and pour the 
hot soup over them. 

Beef Olives— One pound and a half of beef, three ounces of 
bread crumbs, two ounces of suet, one teaspoon each of chopped 
parsley, thyme and marjoram, a grating of nutmeg and lemon 
rind, one egg, one pint of brown gravy. Cut the beef into pieces 
of half an inch thick and four inches long, and beat them out flat. 
Chop up the trimmings of the beef, the suet, parsley, thyme and 
marjoram and mix them in a bowl with the bread crumbs, the 
grated lemon rind, nutmeg, one-half teaspoon of salt, just a dash 
of pepper and the egg; stuff each piece of beef with this mixture, 
roll it up and tie round v/ith a piece of string. Place these stuffed 
rolls of beef in a stew-pan with one pint of seasoned brown gravy 
(that has been left over from roast meat) and stew gently for 
three-quarters of an hour. For serving take off the string and 
dish up with a border of mashed potato and gravy poured round. 

Cauliflower au Gratin — Boil one nice cauliflower in salted 
water till tender, then take up and drain. Mix one-half ounce of 
butter and one ounce of flour together, add one gill of cold water 
and stir the sauce over the fire till it is thick and quite smooth, 
then add one tablespoon of cream and a pinch of salt; stir in 
one ounce of grated Parmesan cheese and pour this gently over 
the cauliflower, sprinkle another ounce of cheese over the top 
and brown either before the fire or in very hot oven. Serve very 
hot. 

Strawberry Cream — There will be sure to be some strawber- 
ries left over from breakfast, as one can always get them cheaper 
by taking more than enough for one meal. Take the stalks off 
and clean about one quart of berries; put them on a hair sieve, 
sprinkle over one ounce of white sugar, and pass them through 
the sieve. Put one ounce of gelatine into a stew-pan with three 
tablespoons of cold water, the juice of one lemon and two ounces 
more of white sugar; when the gelatine is melted strain it into 
the strawberries, add half pint of whipped cream, stir all lightly 
together, pour into a wet mold and put it away in a very cool 
place to set till wanted. Mrs. H. Ross Edwards.

baking dish with about one inch of water around them. Put 
into the oven and bake slowly until set. When done beat up the 
whites of two eggs with two tablespoonfuls of sugar, spread 
on custard and brown in the oven. To be served cold. These 
are very nice. 

Ginger Cookies — One-half cup molasses, one-half cup butter-

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 275 

Broiled Ham— Select a nice large slice of rather lean ham, 
broil lightly on both sides, season with a dash of pepper. 

A Meal in Itself— Boil one-quarter pound macaroni in slight- 
ly salted water until tender. Grate cheese over it, add a spoon- 
ful cold stewed tomato, then a light layer of chopped meat. Sea- 
son with salt, pepper and a little cold gravy and small pieces of 
butter. Repeat this until the dish is full, adding milk to moisten. 
Bake about one-half hour. This is nutritious and very good in- 
deed. 

Stewed Cherries — Pick and wash one quart cherries. Cover 
with sufficient boiling water to cook them. When half done add 
three-fourths large cup sugar, stir lightly and cook slowly until 
the sirup is clear and thick. 

Egg Salad — Boil three eggs until hard and place in cold 
water. When cold take off shells, slice in two lengthwise. Lay 
on a dish covered with lettuce leaves. Pour over a sauce made of 
three tablespoons melted butter, one of lemon juice, one of minced 
pickle, one-half teaspoon of grated lemon rind, a little v/hite 
pepper and small saltspoon salt. 

Pineapple Fritters — Make a batter with one egg beaten sepa- 
rately. To the yolk add one-half cup milk, pinch of salt and 
enough flour to make a stiff batter; the beaten white and a half- 
teaspoon baking powder. Open a can of best pineapple. Cut 
each slice in half, dip in the batter and fry in very hot lard. 
Drain, sprinkle with powdered sugar and serve on a dish covered 
with a napkin. One-third can of pineapple is sufficient for a 
meal. The same quantity of fresh pineapple is much more de- 
sirable and at this season no more expensive.

Stewed Gooseberries — Pick over a quart box of gooseberries, 
put over the fire with a little water and about three-quarters of 
a cup of sugar. Stew gently until the skins are well broken. 
Serve very cold. 

Codfish Balls — Shred a cup and a half of salt codfish, letting 
it lie in cold v/ater during the process, as well as over night. Put 
into a dish v/ith three cups of sliced raw potatoes. Cover with 
boiling water and boil gently until the potatoes are soft. Drain 
off all the water and mash thoroughly with a potato masher. Add 
a little pepper, two tablespoonfuls of milk, a tablespoonful of but- 
ter and beat with a fork until light and creamy. When cool flour 
the hands and mold into flat cakes. Pry in a deep kettle in a wire 
basket. These may be prepared the day before and are much more 
palatable than those made with the codfish shredded and put 
up in boxes. 

Melton Veal — Take a pound any cold veal, chop it fine and 
season with one-half saltspoon of salt, one saltspoon of pepper 
and a teaspoonful of lemon juice. Add two or three tablespoon- 
fuls of cracker crumbs and moisten with soup stock or hot water. 
Take one-third as much finely chopped ham as of veal, season 
with mustard and cayenne, add one tablespoonful of cracker 
crumbs and moisten v/ith hot stock or water. Butter a mold 
and line it with slices of hard-boiled egg. Put in the two mix- 
tures irregularly, so that when cut it will have a mottled ap- 
pearance; press in closely and steam three-quarters of an hour. 
Set away to cool. Remove from the mold and slice before serv- 
ing. This is a convenient way of serving pieces of veal that would 
not otherwise be utilized. 

Rice Croquettes — One pint of cold boiled rice warmed in a 
double boiler with two or three tablespoonfuls of milk. When 
soft add one egg, well beaten, one tablespoonful of butter, half a 
teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper and one heaping tablespoon- 
ful of fine-chopped parsley. Shape, roll in fine dry crumbs, then 
in beaten egg and again in crumbs, and fry in smoking-hot fat, 
the same as for fishballs. 

Entire- Wheat Buns — Scald one large cupful of milk. Pour it 
hot over one-half cup of sugar and one-half teaspoonful salt. Add 
one-quarter cup of melted butter. V/hen luke-warm add one-half 
cake compressed yeast dissolved in a cup of luke-warm water. 
Stir in about three cups and a half of entire-wheat flour, adding 
a well-beaten egg and one-half cup dried currants. Let it rise 
until light. If too soft to handle, add a little white flour. Knead 
a few minutes, roll out, cut into biscuits and let them rise again 



/THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 277 

until very light. Bake about twenty minutes in an oven not so 
hot as for white biscuits. 

Chicken Stew — Get a fowl for boiling, singe and cut into pieces 
for serving. Cover with boiling water, add one heaping teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and simmer until tender. Remove the chicken to a hot 
platter, strain the liquor and remove the fat. Add to the liquor 
one cup of milk and heat it again. Melt a large tablespoonful 
of butter in a sauce-pan, add two tablespoonfuls of flour, and 
when well mixed pour on slowly the liquor. Add one-quarter 
teaspoon of salt, one-eighth teaspoon of pepper, half a teaspoon- 
ful of celery salt and one teaspoonful of lemon juice. Pour over 
the chicken and serve. 

Potato Puff — Prepare one pint of hot mashed potatoes sea- 
soned with one-half teaspoon salt, one-quarter saltspoon pepper, 
one-half teaspoon celery salt, and butter size of walnut, making it 
quite moist with hot milk. Beat the yolks and whites of two eggs 
separately, and stir them into the potatoes when slightly cooled. 
Turn into a shallow baking dish, pile it in a rocky form and bake 
until it is puffed and brov/ned. 

Sago Cream — Cook one-half cup of sago in one pint of milk 
until clear, add a pinch of salt and three tablespoons of sugar. 
Beat the whites of three eggs, add to the mixture and cook two 
minutes. Flavor with lemon when a little cool and fold in lightly 
one cup of whipped cream. Pour into a mold and set on ice. 

Strawberry Sauce — Crush a pint of berries, add half a cup -of 
sugar and let them stand an hour or two. Serve on each dish 
of the sago cream. Addie S. Chenoweth.

DINNER. 

Cream of onion soup. 

Lamb chops in batter (New Orleans style). 

Stewed potatoes. French peas. 

Chilled tomatoes, mayonnaise dressing. 

Raspberry custard. Perfection sponge cake. 

Black coffee. 



Iced Wheat Flakes — Stir four heaping tablespoonfuls of 
Fruen's wheat wafers into three and a half cups of fast boiling 
water, add a half-teaspoonful of salt, and cook for twenty min- 
utes, using a double boiler if you have it. Cook the wafers the 
day before using, pour into coffee cups, filling each half full, place 
on ice over night and when ready to serve remove from cups and 
eat with powdered sugar and cream. 

Creole Kedgeree — One cup of cold salmon or codfish steak 
(left over from yesterday's dinner), flaked and freed from bone; 
one cup cold boiled rice; one cold boiled egg, chopped fine; one- 
half teaspoonful of salt; one-fourth of a saltspoonful of cayenne 
pepper; one level tablespoonful of butter, and, if you have it, a 
saltspoonful of curry powder. Mix well together, cook for three 
minutes and serve with thin slices of nicely browned buttered 
toast. 

Green Bean Salad — Pour the liquor from a pint of well- 
cooked, cold string beans and lay them upon a towel to drain 
perfectly. Dress with a roumaine salad dressing made as follows: 
Grate a teaspoonful of onion, mix it with an equal quantity of 
lemon juice, a heaping saltspoon of salt and one of powdered 
sugar, a level saltspoonful each of pepper and dry^mustard, and 
a tablespoonful of salad oil. Sugar may be omitted. 

Baked Southern Waffles — To one pint of flour add one cup of 
warm — not hot — cornmeal mush, a small teaspoonful of salt, four 
eggs beaten light (yolks and whites separately) — a half cupful 
of cream, and a cup of sweet milk. Stir the cream and the beaten 
yolks of the eggs into the mush, then add the flour and the milk, 
stirring well and mixing perfectly smooth. The whites of the 
eggs should be beaten to a stiff froth and added the last thing 
before baking. Have your gem-pans warm and well-greased and 
bake in a hot oven eight minutes. This quantity will make tWo 
dozen, but they are of so melting a quality that I think you will 
find them none too many for five. 

Cream of Onion Soup — This most palatable soup is warmly 
commended by a well-known physician as an exceedingly health- 
ful hot-weather dish. Fry four medium-sized onions, cut fine, in 
two level tablespoonfuls of butter, but do not allow them to 
brown; add to the onions three pints of water, a teaspoonful of 
salt, half a saltspoonful of pepper, a small bunch of parsley, and 
boil sixty minutes. Strain, and add one quart of milk thickened 
with two level tablespoonfuls of cornstarch dissolved in an equal 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 279 

quantity of cold water. Cook for ten minutes longer, and just 
before serving add three heaping tablespoonfuls of butter. 

Chops in Batter — Have your butcher cut you eight loin chops 
from last year's mutton (known in most markets as lamb). They 
should weigh two pounds. Cut each chop in two, remove the bone, 
scrape carefully and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Make a rich 
batter with one cup of flour, a quarter-teaspoonful of salt, two 
eggs beaten light, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter and a cup 
of milk. Dip each piece of the chops in batter and drop into a 
kettle of boiling-hot lard. The secret of cooking meat prop- 
erly in this way is to keep the fat at the boiling point, so do 
not put in more than three pieces at a time, and if well done 
you will find them as tender as spring chicken. 

French Peas — Shell two quarts of green peas and boil in 
slightly salted water for twenty-five minutes. Then put them in a 
sieve and drain as dry as possible. Put two tablespoonfuls of 
butter in a saucepan, place over the fire and when it melts stir 
in a dessertspoonful of flour, making it quite free from lumps. 
Dissolve a level teaspoonful of pov/dered sugar in a cupful of 
cream, add it gradually to the butter and flour, and when it boils 
hard stir in the peas and let them stew until they are heated 
through, stirring to prevent burning. 

Raspberry Custard — Mix together the yolks of two eggs, two 
cups of milk, two level tablespoonfuls of sugar and one scant 
tablespoonful of cornstarch. Cook slowly over the fire in a 
double boiler, removing when it reaches the boiling point. Mash 
one pint of red raspberries with the back of a spoon, place in 
pretty glass dish, pour over them the custard and set away to cool. 
Just before the dinner hour whip the two whites as stiff as possi- 
ble, color with the tiniest particle of Burnett's rose coloring and 
mix with a tablespoonful of powdered sugar. Spread this over 
the custard and serve v/ith perfection sponge cake. 

Perfection Sponge Cake — Measure carefully one-third of a cup 
of flour and one-half a cup of granulated sugar, sift four times and 
set aside. Separate the yolks and whites of four eggs, reserving 
two of the yolks for salad dressing. Whip the whites as stiff as 
possible, adding when half-beaten one-fourth of a teaspoonful of 
cream tartar. Beat in the sugar, then the two yolks and lastly 
the flour, stirring very lightly after adding the flour. Flavor with 
a teaspoonful of vanilla and bake in a pan that has never been 
greased. It requires a slow oven and will bake in twenty-five min- 
utes. This quantity fills a pan T^/^ by T^^ inches and iy2 inches

Compote of Gooseberries — Top and tail one quart of nice 
gooseberries and pour over them some boiling water; then take 
out and plunge them into cold water, with which has been mixed 
a tablespoonful of vinegar (which will assist to keep the fruit 
a good color), make a pint of sirup thus: One pint of water, 
three-fourths pound of sugar (white), boil together fifteen min- 
utes, carefully removing the scum as it rises; drain the goose- 
berries and put them in; simmer them gently until the fruit is 
nicely pulped and tender, without being broken; then dish the 
gooseberries on a glass dish; boil sirup for two or three minutes, 
pour over the gooseberries and serve cold. 

Souffle of Fish — Take one-half pound of any cold fish, free 
from bones and skin, pound it in a mortar with one ounce of but- 
ter, rub this through a sieve, then put it into a basin, add the 
yolks of three eggs, one by one, and mix well; stir in one gill of 
cream whipped, one dash of pepper, one-half teaspoon of salt 
and a grating of nutmeg. Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff 
froth and stir in very lightly. Pour this mixture into a round 
mold and bake about ten minutes. Serve very hot. 

Potato Scallops— One pound of cold potatoes, one-half cup 
of milk, one and one-half ounces of butter, one and one-half 
ounces of grated Parmesan cheese; mash the potatoes quite soft 
v/ith the milk and the butter melted; add half the cheese, two 
dashes of pepper and one-half teaspoon of salt (scant). Fill some 
patty pans with this mixture and brown them in the oven. While 
hot glaze each over with melted butter and the rest of the 
cheese; serve very hot in the pattie pans on a napkin. 

Yankee Puffs— One ounce of butter, one tablespoon of sugar, 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 281 

two eggs (whites and yolks separate), one and one-half teacups 
of milk, one and one-half teacups of flour, one-half saltspoon of 
salt, three-fourths teaspoon of vanilla. Beat the butter to a 
cream; add the sugar and well-beaten yolks, then the milk, which 
should be salted; dredge in the flour by degrees, and when these 
are well mixed add the flavoring and whites of eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth. Bake in well-buttered cups about fifteen or twenty 
minutes till of a light brovv^n. As these puffs rise very much the 
cups must not be more than half filled. 

Koumiss — Into one quart of new milk put one gill of fresh 
buttermilk and three or four lumps of white sugar. Mix well and 
see that the sugar dissolves. Put into warm place to stand ten 
hours, when it will be thick. Pour from one vessel to another un- 
til it becomes smooth and uniform in consistency. Bottle and 
keep in warm place twenty-four hours. The bottles must be tight- 
ly corked and the corks tied down. Shake well five minutes be- 
fore opening. It makes a very agreeable drink. Instead of but- 
termilk some use a teaspoonful of yeast. The richer your milk 
(which should be unskimmed) the better will be your koumiss. 

Roast Shoulder of Lamb — It makes a nice roast, and it is 
sometimes more economical to have a joint that will be nice hot 
for first day's dinner; then can be used sliced cold with salad for 
next day's meal, and then used up for mince or croquettes and the 
bones used for soup. 

Green Beans, Maitre d' Hotel Dressing — One pound of green 
beans, two ounces of butter, one tablespoonful of chopped pars- 
ley, the juice of one-half lemon. Pick and string the beans, cut- 
ting each bean into two or three strips, v/ash them v/ell in cold 
water, drain them and put them into a saucepan of boiling water; 
boil fast till tender. Put them in cold water for a few minutes, 
dry them in a clean cloth and put them into a stew-pan with the 
butter, parsley, lemon juice, a grating of nutmeg, just a dash of 
pepper and one-half teaspoonful of salt. When quite hot serve 
them with sippets of fried bread. 

Raspberry and Red Currant Tart — When fruit is so cheap and 
plentiful as it is just now fruit pies always taste so much nicer 
made and baked in a deep pie dish (English fashion). There is 
always sure to be some raspberries left over from luncheon; put 
a layer of these at the bottom of the pie dish, then a layer of red 
currants cleaned and stemmed, then another layer of raspber- 
ries, then currants, and proceed till your dish is full (it Y\all take 
about three pints of fruit to make a nice pie) ; sprinkle over one- 
half cupful of sugar and one-half cupful of water, put a thin layer 
of pie crust round the edge, then put on your top crust, brush 
over with a little water and sift a little granulated sugar on the 
top. Bake in moderate oven about thirty minutes; the sugar 
makes it have a nice frosted look; only be careful you watch it 
after it is in the oven so that it does not burn.

California breakfast food, sugar and cream. 

Scalloped mutton. Whole-v/heat crisps. 

Coffee. 



LUNCHEON. 

Curried fish. 

Hulled corn, creamed. Scotch scones.

Tea. 



DINNER. 

Left-over soup. 

Smothered beef. Egg-plant fritters. 

Potatoes in the half-shell. 

Crystallized fruit. Delicate cake. 

Coffee. 



Scalloped Mutton — Remove the fat and skin from cold roast 
mutton, cut the meat in small thin slices, season it with salt and 
pepper. Butter a shallow dish, put in a layer of bread crumbs, 
then a layer of meat, then cold boiled macaroni, then the gravy 
left from the roast. Cover the top with a layer of crumbs moist- 
ened in one-third of a cup of melted butter. Bake in a moderate 
oven fifteen minutes, or until the crumbs are a light brown. 

Whole-Wheat Crisps — One cup sour cream, one-fourth cup 
sugar, one saltspoonful salt, two cups whole-wheat flour. Mix 
in the order given. Take out on the board and knead until stiff 
enough to roll out thin as a wafer, using more flour if necessary. 
Cut with a biscuit cutter, and bake on ungreased tins in a very 
hot oven. The sugar will sweeten the sour cream sufficiently. 
Very good for children and people with weak digestion. 

Curried Pish — Cook one teaspoonful of chopped onion in one 
tablespoonful of butter five minutes. Be careful not to burn it. 
Mix one teaspoonful of curry powder with one tablespoonful of 
flour and one saltspoonful of salt and stir into the butter. Add 
one cup of hot water gradually, stirring briskly to make a smooth 
■paste. To this add one cup of cold, flaked, seasoned fish and 
serve as soon as the fish is thoroughly heated through. 

Hulled Corn, Creamed — Make a cream sauce of one pint of 
milk, two tablespoonfuls butter, two heaping tablespoonfuls of 
flour, one-half teaspoonful salt and one-half saltspoonful of pep- 
per. Heat the milk in a double boiler. Put the butter in a granite 
sauce-pan and stir till it melts and bubbles. Add the flour and 
stir till well mixed. Pour on one-third of the hot milk. Let it 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 283 

boil and stir well as it thickens. Add another third of the milk, 
let it boil up and thicken and stir vigorously till perfectly smooth. 
Add the remainder of the milk, let it boil, and when smooth add 
the salt and pepper, using more if high seasoning be desired. 
Into this cream sauce stir one pint of cooked, hulled corn and 
cook all together for two minutes. Delicious. 

Currant Tarts — Make a rich pie crust and roll it out one- 
eighth of an inch thick. Line small faited patty-tins with this 
paste. Take a fork and prick the paste at intervals of one-half 
inch to prevent its blistering. When done remove the tart shells 
from the tins and fill them with currant jam. 

Currant Jam — Wash, stem and mash the fruit. Allow the 
proportion of one pound of sugar to one pound of fruit. Put the 
fruit and one-quarter of the sugar into a granite kettle; when 
boiling add another quarter of the sugar, and when all is used 
let it boil till very thick. Putting in only a little sugar at a time 
prevents the fruit from becoming hard. 

Left-Over Soup — Take bones and any good trimmings from 
yesterday's roast, pieces of steak or mutton chops (about two 
pounds in all), a cold fried egg, two quarts cold water, a teaspoon- 
ful salt, one saltspoonful celery salt, four cloves and one table- 
spoonful mixed herbs. Cut up the meat and bones and put them 
in the kettle with the cold water. Add the other ingredients and 
simmer till the bones are clean, the meat in rags, and the water 
reduced nearly one-half. Remove all scum as it rises. Strain, 
cool, and remove the fat. When ready to serve heat the stock to 
the boiling point, adding any tomatoes, macaroni or rice left 
from yesterday's meals. 

Egg-Plant Fritters — Put a small egg-plant whole into boil- 
ing, salted water mixed with one tablespoonful of vinegar; cook 
twenty minutes; drain and mash. To one pint of egg-plant add 
half a cup of flour, two beaten eggs, one heaping saltspoonful 
salt and one-half saltspoonful pepper. Shape in small cakes and 
fry in deep fat, browning well on both sides. 

Potatoes in the Half-Shell — Wash, scrub and bake three 
smooth potatoes. Cut in halves lengthwise, and without break- 
ing the skin scoop out the potato into a hot bowl. Mash and add 
one even tablespoonful of butter, one of hot milk, one saltspoon- 
ful of salt and one-half saltspoonful of pepper. Beat the whites 
of two eggs stiff and mix it with the potato. Fill the skins with 
the potato mixture, heaping it lightly on the top. Brown slightly. 

Crystallized Fruit — Boil one cup of granulated sugar and one 
cup of boiling water together for half an hour. It must not be 
stirred and must boil slowly, not furiously. Dip the point of a 
skewer into the sirup and then into cold water. If the thread 
formed breaks off brittle the sirup is ready. When done, set the 
sauce-pan in hot water to keep the sirup from candying. Take 
the prepared fruits on the point of a darning needle or small 
skewer, dip them into the sirup and then lay them on a dish which 
has been slightly oiled. When thoroughly cold they are ready 
for use. 



284 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Delicate Cake— One cup sugar, one-half cup butter, one-half 
cup sv/eet milk, two cups flour, one teaspoonful baking powder, 
whites of four eggs. Cream the butter and sugar together, add 
the milk, sift the baking powder with the flour three times and 
add it gradually. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth and 
stir in lightly, and bake one-half hour. Miss Tahleda Mann.

Stewed Kidneys— Cut three kidneys each into three length- 
wise pieces. Warm three tablespoonfuls butter in the frying-pan. 
Before this is hot put in the kidney, with a teaspoonful minced 
onion, a half-teacup water and a cup of good gravy. Cover close- 
ly, simmer gently flfteen minutes, add one pinch each mace, nut- 
meg and pepper, one-half teaspoonful salt and juice of half a 
lemon. Have ready a very hot platter with slices of delicately 
fried bread or buttered toast. Pour the kidney on the slices, 
thicken the gravy with brown flour, boil up once and serve. 

English Breakfast Gems — Mix well one pint sifted flour, one 
teaspoonful baking powder, one-half teaspoonful salt, one tea- 
spoonful sugar; rub into this three teaspoonfuls melted butter, 
add one cupful sweet milk, beaten yolks of two eggs; lastly the 
beaten whites of the eggs; heat iron gem-pans, grease well, fill 
over half-full, bake quickly. 

Pannikins — Chop fine enough cold meat to make a pint — if 
any of fricasseed kidney is left Irom breakfast, add it. Put the 



^HE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 285 

meat on to heat with two tablespoonfuis water and a cup of rich 
sweet miik. Thicken with a tablespoonfiil each of flour and but- 
ter rubbed together; add a half teaspoonful of salt, a good pinch 
of pepper and a teaspoonful chopped parsley, if liked; pour this 
creamed hash into the center of a hot platter; bake as many eggs 
as are required in hot, buttered cups; turn them out and arrange 
them around the creamed meat; put a pinch of salt and pepper 
and a bit of butter the size of a hazelnut on each egg. 

Compote of Gooseberries — Top and tail one quart of goose- 
berries, drop into boiling water two minutes, drain and let them 
lie three minutes in cold water containing a tablespoonful vin- 
egar to restore their color, then drain quite dry. Boil for ten min- 
utes a sirup made from a pint each of sugar and water; drop 
in the gooseberries and boil them gently until just tender — about 
ten minutes. Pour into a glass dish. Tiny shreds of lemon peel 
boiled with the sirup improves the compote. 

Bachelor's Buttons — Rub together two tablespoonfuis butter 
and five of flour. Divide five tablespoonfuis sugar into two por- 
tions; stir one into the flour; heat the other up with one egg and 
add to the rest. Flavor with few drops of almond flavoring. Make 
into balls — v/ith the hand — the size of a hickorynut, sprinkle 
lightly with white sugar, place on buttered paper and bake ra:ther 
slowly. Very dainty. 

Cream of Pea Soup — Put one pint of peas, measured after 
shelling, into a granite sauce-pan with enough cold v/ater to cover 
and cook until tender. Take out half of them, rub the remainder 
through a sieve with the water in which they were cooked. Scald 
three cupfuls of sweet milk, rub together two tablespoonfuis of 
flour and one of butter, add to the milk and the peas that were 
rubbed through the sieve. Stir until it thickens, add the remain- 
ing peas, a cup of cream, heated to scalding, a scant teaspoonful 
of salt and a quarter-teaspoonful of pepper. A tiny sprig of 
mint boiled with the peas is liked by many. The peas should be 
tender in half an hour. 

Halibut a la Poulette— Take a piece of halibut v/eighing three 
pounds, pour boiling water over it, and the skin will come off 
easily. Free it from skin and bones and cut it into strips about 
three inches long, two inches wide and half an inch thick. Lay 
on a platter, sprinkle slightly with salt, pepper and lemon juice, 
lay a thin slice of onion on each strip and set it away for half an 
hour. Have ready two large tablespoonfuis of melted butter, re- 
move the onion, dip each piece of fish in the melted butter, roll 
them up, fasten with a little wooden skewer, dip the rolls in the 
butter again, put in a dripping pan, dredge thickly with fiour. 
Put a tablespoonful of butter, a tablespoonful of vinegar and a 
teacup of hot water into the pan and bake twenty minutes in a hot 
oven. Boil three eggs very hard fifteen minutes, remove the 
shells, cut the whites into rings, rub the yolks to a fine powder. 
When the fish is done place on a hot platter; remove the skewers, 
pour over it a boiling sauce made of two scant tablespoonfuis of 
butter rubbed smooth with one of flour, a cup of milk, a teaspoon-' 



286 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

fill of chopped parsley, one-half teaspoonful of salt and one- 
quarter teaspoonful of pepper. Scatter the powdered yolks over 
this sauce and garnish with the rings of the white of eggs. White- 
fish may be used instead of halibut. 

New Potatoes with Sauce Bechamel — Scrape and "eye" the 
potatoes, having them as nearly of a size as may be. Drop into 
boiling water containing a half-teaspoon of salt. As soon as they 
are tender, drain, put in a hot dish, sprinkle a saltspoon of salt 
over them and let them keep warm while the sauce is preparing. 
Heat a scant pint of milk to the boiling point, rub very thorough- 
ly a large tablespoon of butter and a small tablespoonful of flour 
together, stir into the hot milk — stir until it is a thick, creamy 
mass. Add a quarter-teaspoonful salt, and pour over the pota- 
toes. 

Raspberry Cream — Place a pint of raspberries in a bowl, add 
one tablespoonful of powdered sugar. Let them stand for an 
hour, then rub through a sieve. Soak one ounce of gelatine in 
two teaspoonfuls of cold milk for half an hour, then add to it 
one cup scalding hot milk, two tablespoonfuls granulated sugar. 
Stir until the ingredients are thoroughly dissolved. Set aside, 
and, when cool, add the strained raspberries. Whip one-half pint 
cream, add one-half teaspoonful vanilla and whisk all lightly to- 
gether. Set in a very cold place to harden. A half-pint of rasp- 
berries may be kept very cold, sweetened slightly and poured 
round the mold, when turned out ready for the table.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 287 

Sliced Pineapple — Cut the slices with a sharp knife as thin 
as possible. Sugar plentifully and let stand for an hour. It looks 
well served on dish with flowers and leaves surrounding it. 
Clover blooms are nice and healthful. 

Veal Trifles — Purchase the evening before and place to stew 
with water sufiicient to cover a veal soup bone costing not less 
than 5 and not more than 10 cents. Be sure that it is fresh and 
from the hind quarter. Cook until tender. Pour off the liquid 
and strain. Cut off the choicest meat and place in ice box till 
morning. This can be done while getting dinner. In the morn- 
ing take one pint of bread crumbs or crackers rolled fine, one egg, 
cayenne pepper enough to lie on the point of a small knife, half 
teaspoonful of black pepper, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one 
ounce of butter, one quarter of an onion chopped fine, one spoon- 
ful of fiour and use enough milk to make stiff batter, in which 
roll the pieces of veal and fry in lard or butter till a light brown. 

Poached Eggs with Sauce — Drop in boiling water. Make 
sauce — one teaspoonful each of flour, vinegar and butter, one- 
quarter teaspoonful salt. Let boil and pour over eggs after re- 
moving from water. 

Warm Breakfast Rolls — Boil one potato, mash it fine; scald 
with water one pint of flour; add of salt one teaspoonful; sugar, 
one heaped tablespoonful; white of egg and one-half cake com- 
pressed yeast. Set to rise, then when very light add flour suffi- 
cient to knead it thoroughly. Do not knead it stiff, but it can 
through thorough work be made stiff enough to not stick to hands 
and yet be made soft. One hour before retiring work in two 
ounces of butter or lard, roll up in woolen cloths, and if warm 
weather place in ice-box. Make out in rolls next morning first 
thing, or if possible one hour earlier than you commence breakfast 
preparations. When very light, bake from ten to fifteen minutes. 

Graham Gems — Take one-half pint of graham fiour, one-half 
pint white flour, the yellow of egg left from rolls, one heaping 
tablespoonful of sugar — remember, no salt or baking powder. 
Have your gem-pans piping hot on top of stove; add enough of 
milk if you can afford it, if not, tepid water will do, to make a 
not very stiff batter. Beat thoroughly and drop in pans. Bake 
quickly in a very hot oven. These alone, with butter, would make 
a wholesome, nourishing meal, on which a dyspeptic might fat- 
ten. 

Soup Olla-Podrida — Take the veal soup bone, boil one hour, 
then strain; add the liquor left in ice-box; add one onion cut 
very fine, one sprig of parsley, one carrot, sliced, two good-sized 
potatoes; one-half teaspoon salt, one-half saltspoon pep- 
per; boil one hour; make dumplings; half-cupful of fiour, 
a little butter — enough to make it crumble; moisten with a 
little of the soup — enough to make a stiff dough; roll out very thin 
and hang the sheets of dough a few minutes by the fire; then 
cut in pieces or threads no larger than a whip cord; boil two or 
three minutes and serve immediately. 
Crrandmother's Greens— Take of wild things— by . this I mean 



288 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

sour docks, dandelions, lambsquarters, etc.— for tliey are excel- 
lent and have a medicinal quality of their ov/n; pick and wash 
carefully and boil till tender; drain and pour over a pint of 
them a dressing made thus: One teaspoon pepper, one-quarter 
cup of vinegar, one spoonful butter, one spoonful flour, one tea- 
spoonful mustard (better not ground); salt to taste; stir well to- 
gether and serve hot. 

Apple Plorendine — This is an old-fashioned pie, which many 
of the young people have forgotten or never heard of; cook two 
apples — or, if green apples are dear, dried apples, stewed and 
mashed fine, are just as good or better — one eg^, the yellow well 
beaten and added to the apple one minute before taking from 
fire; also one small cup of sugar, piece of butter size of hickory- 
nut and one teaspoonful of flour; spice with nutmeg, lemon or 
vanilla; perhaps we grandmothers would prefer rose water; make 
a rich puff paste; roll very thin; put the mixture in the dough, 
lay strips of the dough across and bake in a quick ov^n; of 
course any housekeeper knows how to make puff paste and that 
a firepan must be used; when done add the white beaten with one 
tablespoonful of sugar on top -and bake one minute. 

Sufficient light rolls will be left for dinner. 

Chicken Fricassee — Have a small chicken nicely prepared, 
boil for one hour at lunch time whole. Split in the back so that 
it will lie open, make a dressing of one cup of bread 
crumbs, teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter teaspoonful of pep- 
per, butter one teaspoonful. Lay the dressing on chick- 
en, which has been seasoned and placed in dripping 
pan with small lump of butter. Cover the dripping 
pan with another pan tightly and place in oven. Cook till ten- 
der, adding the top of the broth left from the boiling from time to 
time. Cook dry, and, uncovering, let it brown. Make gravy to 
be served separately from what is left of the broth the chicken 
was boiled in, by placing it in the pan from which the fowl has 
been removed, and stirring in a thickening made of a spoonful 
of browned flour moistened with milk or cream. 

Creamed Peas — Peas have a finer taste to have the pods 
boiled and the peas cooked in the water after they have been 
taken out. Add a saltspoonful salt, quarter saltspoonful black 
pepper, one teaspoonful fiour, one tablespoonful butter. Stir in 
quickly when the one pint of hulled peas have become soft. 

Strawberries if dusty should be washed before they are hulled. 
Lay carefully in a sieve for a few moments. If possible place 
on table with strawberry leaves surrounding them. Always 
remember that next to cheerfulness beauty and tastefulness pro- 
motes digestion, and in reality the manner is more than the 
"menu." Grandmother Brown.

FRIDAY, JUNE THE TWENTY-FIFTH. 



BREAKFAST. 

Strawberries and cream. 

Broiled ham and egg toast. 

Coffee. 

LUNCHEON. 

Salad of calves' brains. 

Bread and butter. Green Onions. 

Cookies. Hot or iced tea. 

DINNER. 

Mock oyster soup. 

Broiled black bass. New potatoes. 

Cucumbers. 

Chocolate cream. Coffee. 



Egg Toast— Beat one egg lightly, add saltspoonful salt and 
one cup of milk; soak the slices of bread in this custard until 
soft. Have a griddle hot and well buttered. Brown each slice 
on one side; then put a piece of butter on the top of each slice 
and turn and brown on the other side. If preferred this can 
be fried in the drippings from the ham, which gives the bread 
a nice flavor. 

Salad of Calves' Brains — Brains should be perfectly fresh. 
Wash in cold water without breaking. Parboil for about ten min- 
utes in a quart of boiling water, salted, to which half a teacup 
of vinegar has been added. When done throw the brains into 
very cold water; this whitens and hardens them. They may be 
made at once into a salad, or will keep until the next day on 
ice. Remove all strings, cut up into pieces the size of a hickory- 
nut. Put a heaping tablespoonful of butter into a frying-pan, 
add teaspoonful of very finely minced onion. Cook a minute, 
then add the brains. Gently saute the brains for ten minutes, 
taking care that they do not burn. Add one saltspoon salt, a salt- 
spoon black pepper, a pinch of mace (rolled), remove from the 
fire and cool. Add about the same bulk of potatoes that have 
been boiled just done enough to slice, and two tablespoonfuls of 
very finely minced parsley; mix lightly together with a fork.^ A 
half pound of brains should be used. 

Sauce for Above — Two eggs, add half a cupful of water, same 
quantity of vinegar, one teaspoonful of mustard, same of salt, 
one tablespoonful of butter. Mix all together, beat gradually on 
the fire, stirring constantly until it becomes of thick, custard- 
like consistency. Let it cool. Pour over the salad and mix 
lightly with a fork. Serve on a flat dish. Garnish with parsley 
or celery leaves.

290 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Cookies — One cup of sugar, one-half a cup of butter, creamed; 
one egg, scant half a cup of sweet milk, saltspoonful of salt, one 
teaspoonful of baking powder, one heaping teaspoonful of cara- 
way seeds, if liked, if not any other flavoring may be used; flour 
sufficient to make them just stiff enough to roll; cut and bake 
in a quick oven. 

Broiled Black Bass — Scale, draw, cut down the back on the 
inside on both sides of the bone, remove bone, wash well and 
dry thoroughly. Lay on a broiler well greased with salt and pork, 
broil flesh side first until nicely browned, which should take about 
twenty minutes; turn and cook just enough to crisp the skin; 
lay on a warm platter, season with one teaspoon of butter and 
saltspoon of salt, garnish with thin slice of lemon and parsley. 

Cucumbers — Cut off an inch from each end of the cucumber 
and pare off a thick paring, as a bitter juice lies near the skin. 
Cut in thin slices; keep in cold water until ready to serve. Drain 
and place in the bowl with ice. Serve with salt, pepper and vine- 
gar. 

Chocolate Cream — Scald one pint of milk, add one ounce of 
grated chocolate and four tablespoonfuls of sugar. Then add 
one-half a box of gelatine which has been dissolved and strained, 
then the well-beaten yolks of five eggs. Set in a pan of ice wa- 
ter and stir often until it begins to thicken. Mold. Serve with 
cream. The whites of the eggs can be used for clearing coffee.

Hominy Griddle Cakes — To a pint of warm boiled hominy 
add a pint of milk or water and a pint of flour. Beat two or three 
eggs and stir into the batter with one-half teaspoonful salt. Fry 
as any other griddle cakes. They are delicious. 

Baked Berry Rolls — One pint of flour, two teaspoonfuls bak-

tablespoonfuls of grated cheese. Put milk on to boil. Fry the 
butter and onions together for eight minutes, then add dry flour 
and cook two minutes longer, being careful not to burn. Stir into 
the milk and cook ten minutes. Rub through a strainer and re- 
turn to the fire. Now add the cheese. Beat the eggs with a 
speck of pepper and salt. Season the soup with the salt and pep- 
per. Hold the colander over the soup and pour the eggs through 
and set back for three minutes where it will not boil. Then serve. 
The cheese may be omitted if this is not liked. 

Strawberry Sponge — One quart of strawberries, half a pack- 
age of gelatine, one cupful and a half of water, one cupful sugar, 
the juice of a lemon, the whites of four eggs. Soak the gelatine 
two hours in half a cupful of the water. Mash the strawberries, 
and add half the sugar to them. Boil the remainder of the sugar 
and the cupful of water gently twenty minutes. Rub the straw- 
berries through a sieve. Add the gelatine to the boiling sirup, 
and take from the fire immediately; then add the straw- 
-berries. Place in a pan of ice water and beat five min- 
utes. Add the whites of eggs and beat until the mixture 
begins to thicken. Pour into the molds and set away to harden. 
Serve with sugar and cream. Ada White.

Frizzled Beef with Cream Toast — Place one-half pound of 
chipped dried beef in a spider (or flat saucepan) and pour over 
it one quart of cold water; let it come to boil; pour off the water 
(this freshens the beef sufficiently); add one tablespoonful of 
butter, quarter-saltspoon of white pepper, and cook one minute. 
Have ready toasted half-dozen small slices of bread. Make a 
cream of one pint of milk, one tablespoonful of butter brought 
to a boil in double boiler, add one tablespoonful of cornstarch, 
wet with milk; let boil four minutes; pour over the toast on hot 
dish. Add the frizzled beef, placing a large spoonful on each 
slice — or can be served apart. 

Pineapple Omelet (new) — Beat five eggs and five tablespoons 
of cold water together in a bowl; when light add two tablespoons 
of sugar, one-half teaspoon salt; pour into flat spider, and as it 
cooks gently lift in places with a four-tined fork till cooked. 
Shred fine five or six slices of fresh pineapple, adding sugar to 
taste. After the omelet is removed to hot platter, place upon it 
the shredded pineapple and fold over and serve. Delicious. 

Bicycle Buns — Over one pint of finely sifted wheat flour pour 
one-half pint of boiling water; stir into it one tablespoonful of 
butter, one-quarter teaspoonful of salt, two-thirds of a cup of 
sugar and one-half cup of softened butter. When all are thor- 
oughly mixed add one-half cake of compressed yeast, which has 
been dissolved in one-half cup of lukewarm water. Set this 
sponge to rise over night; in the morning knead and roll out 
the dough to about one-half inch in thickness, cut with round 
cooky cutter, then with case-knife cut strips toward the center, 
making "wheels;" connect two of the buns with small strip of 
dough, making imitations of bicycles; brush over with melted 
butter, let rise and bake in moderate oven thirty minutes. If 
carefully prepared these buns are an ornament to the table, as 
well as being very toothsome. 

Green-Pea Soup — Wash well the pods from the half-peck of 
shelled peas for dinner and boil them for fifteen minutes with one- 
half teaspoon of salt in two quarts of water, then remove them 
from the kettle, and add the water in which the lamb (also for 
dinner) has been boiled; let cook until the liquor is reduced to 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 293 

three pints. Season with tablespoonful of butter rubbed into 
two tablespoonfuls of flour and quarter-teaspoon of pepper. This 
soup is very nice, combining the taste of the lamb and peas, and 
also it is economical, as it utilizes what many people would throw 
away. 

Meringue Sago Pudding — Take two-thirds teacup of sago — 
wash and pick over carefully. Place in saucepan with one quart 
of milk, to which has been added a half -spoonful of salt; place 
where it will warm very slowly, and let it stand one hour, sim- 
mering very gently. When softened sufllciently (as it will be 
by that time) remove from fire and when cool add four well- 
beaten yolks and two whites of eggs (reserving the whites of 
the other two eggs for meringue), half-tablespoon of butter, four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and teacup of cold milk. Flavor with 
one teaspoonful vanilla; bake one-half hour in moderate oven. 
When done and cool beat up the two whites of eggs with two 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar till firm; place on the pudding 
and put back in the oven and let brown slightly on top.

one-third pint graham flour, let it boil thoroughly after each 
handful of flour, so that it is kept constantly boiling. Serve with 
cream and sugar. 

Fried Trout — They should be well cleaned, washed once only, 
drained and salted with about one-half teaspoonful salt, then 
rolled in flour and cornmeal (half of each) thoroughly mixed. 
For two pounds of flsh take one-fourth pound of salt pork, cut 
in thin slices and fried a crisp brown. Take the pork from the 
pan and put the fish in, having only enough to cover the bottom..' 
Fry brown on both sides; serve hot, with the salt pork as a garn- 
ish. 

Fricassee of Cold Meat — Take one and one-half pints of cold 
meat of any kind, one pint of warm water, one teaspoonful meat 
extract, two tablespoonfuls of butter, two of flour, one 
teaspoonful salt, three dashes of pepper, one teaspoonful of 
onion juice, if desired; slice the meat; season it with salt; put 
the butter into a frying pan over the fire; when hot add the 
fiour, stirring until smooth and brown; draw the pan to a cooler 
place and gradually add the water, stirring all the time; add 
the extract; put over the fire again; add the pepper and onion 
juice; simmer five minutes; add the cold meat and cook three 
minutes longer; serve on a hot dish with a border of toast. 

Cucumbers Pickled — Take as small-sized cucumbers as can 
be obtained in market, a small quantity, a dozen or two, as they 
are not intended for long keeping; put them in strong salted 
water over night; take out of the brine, wipe dry and cover with 
strong vinegar; in two or three days they are ready for use. 

Sweet Strawberry Shortcake — Two eggs, one-half cup of 
sugar, one cup of milk, two of flour, one tablespoonful of butter, 
one pinch of salt, one teaspoonful baking powder. Beat the but- 
ter and sugar together, add the eggs, well-beaten, and the milk. 
Mix the powder with the flour and sift; stir into the beaten eggs 
and sugar; make stiff enough to roll out about one-quarter inch 
thick. Bake in four deep tins. Have three pints of strawber- 
ries mixed with a cupful of sugar and spread between the cakes 
and on the top. A meringue, made with the white of one egg 
beaten and a tablespoonful of powdered sugar, may be spread 
over the top layer of berries. 

Chocolate — Scrape fine one ounce (one of the small squares) 
of plain chocolate, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar and put in a 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 299 

small saucepan with a tablespoonful of hot water; stir over a 
hot fire for a minute or two, until it is perfectly smooth and 
glossy, and then stir it all into a quart of boiling milk, or half 
milk and half water. Mix thoroughly and serve at once with 
cream. Made in this way chocolate is perfectly smooth and free 
of oily particles, and is of fine flavor. 

Chicken Stew, with Dumplings — One chjcken, weighing about 
three pounds; one tablespoonful of butter, three of flour, one 
small onion, if liked, three slices of carrot, three of turnip, one 
teaspoonful of salt, three dashes of pepper. Cut the chicken in 
pieces suitable for serving, wash and put on to boil in a kettle 
with three pints of boiling water. Put the carrot, turnip and 
onion, cut fine, in a saucepan with the butter and cook slowly 
half an hour, stirring often; take up the vegetables in a strainer 
and with the back of a spoon mash as much as possible of them 
through into the kettle; skim two spoonfuls of chicken fat from 
the water and put in the pan where the vegetables were cooked; 
when boiling hot stir into it the flour until it is a dark brown, 
then add to the chicken broth with the pepper and salt and sim- 
mer until tender, which will take about two hours for a year-old 
chicken. Twenty minutes before serving put the kettle over the 
fire, boil up and put in the dumplings and cook twenty minutes; 
serve with the dumplings around the edge of the dish. 

For the dumplings take one and one-half teacupfuls of flour, 
one teaspoonful of baking powder, one-saltspoonful of salt, sifted 
together, with enough cold water to make a smooth batter, toler- 
ably thick so it will drop from a spoon. 

Stewed Green Corn — Half a dozen medium-'Sized ears of corn 
(more if small), clean, split down the center of the grains and 
scrape off the cobs; boil uncovered in a quart of water for three- 
quarters of an hour. Then add two dashes of pepper, a heaping 
saltspoonful of salt, two tablespoonfuls of butter, and one-half 
cup of milk; boil five minutes and serve.

raspberries and one pint of white currants, rub them through a 
strainer and add one pint of sugar and let stand one-half hour;

DINNER. 

Normandy soup. 

Baked blue fish. New potatoes. Cucumbers. 

Marguerite pudding. 

Coffee. 



Something for Breakfast — An economical way of using ham, 
or bacon and eggs that have been left from a previous meal, is to 
put them in a wooden bowl and chop them quite fine, adding 
a little mashed or cold chopped potato, and a little bacon gravy, 
if there was any left. Mix and form into flat cakes, dip in raw 
egg and cracker crumbs, and fry in a spider, a light brown on 
both sides; serve hot. 

Eggs in Cases — Take six small rolls, cut off the tops and 
scrape out as much of the crumb as possible. Brush over well with 
melted butter and set in a quick oven long enough to crisp them. 
In the meantime, break in a bowl six eggs, beat just enough to 
mix, add six tablespoonfuls milk or cream, one-half teaspoonful 
salt, one-fourth teaspoonful white pepper, one teaspoonful of 
grated Sapsago cheese, and two tablespoonfuls butter. Stir over 
the fire until the consistence of a soft scramble, fill the cases and 
serve at once. 

Japanese Fritters — Beat together two eggs until well mixed, 
add one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, and one pint of milk, 
and a teaspoonful of vanilla. Cut stale bread in fingers four by 
two inches in size; soak them well in the custard, roll in dry 
bread crumbs and fry in deep fat; when nicely browned, drain 
and serve with powdered sugar. 

Normandy Soup — Wipe off a good-sized knuckle of veal, put 
it in the soup kettle with three quarts of cold water and place 
where it will heat slowly. When at the simmering point skim 
carefully and put where it will cook slowly but steadily for three 
hours. Add six white onions peeled and thinly sliced and one- 
half of a small stale loaf of baker's bread and simmer one hour 
longer. Take out the meat, and rub the soup through a puree 
sieve, pressing through as much of the onion and bread as possi- 
ble. Put in a double boiler; rub one tablespoonful of butter and 
two tablespoonfuls of flour to a smooth paste and stir into the 
hot mixture until it thickens. Season with a large teaspoonful 
of salt and a fourth of a teaspoonful of pepper, and a half salt- 
spoonful of grated nutmeg; add one pint of milk previously 
scalded, and serve at once. 

Baked Blue Fish — Make a dressing of bread crumbs, two 
tablespoonfuls of minced onion, a teaspoonful of chopped pars- 
ley, three tablespoonfuls of butter, a small teaspoonful of salt, 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 301 

one-fourth of a teaspoonful of white pepper, and a beaten egg. 
Stuff the fish and tie securely. Place in a pan, with a teacupful 
of hot water and a tablespoonful of butter, and bake an hour 
and a quarter, basting very often. Garnish with slices of lemon, 
or bits of cress, and serve with a sauce made as follows: 

Dressing for Blue Fish — Boil up the gravy in which fish was 
baked, put in a large tablespoonful of catsup, a tablespoonful of 
brown flour wet with four tablespoonfuls of cold water, and the 
juice of a lemon. Strain and serve in a sauce boat. 

Marguerite Pudding — Scald one quart of milk in a double 
boiler. Beat together three-quarters of a cupful of sugar, two 
tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, two tablespoonfuls of flour, the 
yolks of flve eggs, one saltspoonf ul of salt and one-half cupful 
of cold milk. Pour the scalded milk over the mixture and re- 
turn to the fire; stir until it thickens, beating until smooth. 
Cook fifteen minutes, add one tablespoonful of butter and one 
teaspoonful of vanilla. Turn into a pudding dish; when cool 
beat the whites of the eggs to a froth, add five tablespoonfuls of 
powdered sugar and beat until very stiff and glossy. Spread over 
the top of the pudding, dust with powdered sugar and put in the 
oven until a delicate brown. Serve cold.

in, slipping the beaten whites last on top. Cover for a minute. 
Season with a half-teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper. 
When done serve on platter, letting the whites and yellow parts 
alternate, with a garnish of green. 

Pried Tomatoes, with Cream — Cut six large, firm tomatoes in 
halves, without peeling lay them in a pan, with a large tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter, having the skin side down. Fry them very 
slowly until quite tender, then place them carefully on a hot dish 
and let the butter remaining in the pan brown a little, then stir a 
tablespoonful of flour into it. When this is brown add to it half 
a pint of boiling milk, and a saltspoonful of salt, stir and blend 
until smooth. Stir all and boil three minutes, then pour it over 
the tomatoes, first adding a dash of pepper and a pinch of salt 
to each piece. 

Chicken and Rice Croquettes — An excellent way of serving 
chicken bits left from dinner the day before is to cut all the meat 
carefully from the bones, chop fine, and to each cupful of the 
chicken add a cupful of boiled rice, one-half teaspoonful of salt, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, half a cupful of milk, a little pep- 
per and an egg. Set the milk on the fire, and as soon as it boils 
add the other ingredients, the egg, thoroughly beaten, last of 
all. Stir the mixture one minute. When it has cooled take about 
a tablespoonful and with both hands press the mass lightly into 
an oblong roll. When the whole quantity has been shaped, roll 
the croquettes lightly in bread crumbs, then dip them in well- 
beaten egg, roll a second time in bread crumbs and fry until brown 
in boiling fat. Two or three minutes will suflice. Be sure that 
the fat is boiling before the croquettes are put in. 

Raspberry Shortcake — Rub into one quart of fiour five ounces 
of lard, a pinch of salt and three tablespoonfuls of baking powder, 
add gradually enough milk to make a soft dough, divide it into 
four parts. Roll one part out lightly, cover a straight-sided pie 
plate with it. Roll out another one and lay it on top of the first; 
proceed the same way with the other two parts, using another 
tin for them; bake quickly, and when done, while hot, lift the 
upper part from each pan. Butter the inner surface and place 
between them a layer of fresh raspberries one inch thick (sweet- 
ened). Serve with cream. 

Shredded Pineapple — In the morning carefully prepare a 
small pineapple. Pare carefully and remove every particle of the 
brown skin. Then with a silver fork tear in small ragged pieces, 
discarding the core. Sprinkle with four tablespoonfuls of pow- 
dered sugar and set away in refrigerator until luncheon time. 

Braised Tongue — Too little known or too seldom attempted 
is the process of braising, and it is one of the most savory ways 
of cooking a tongue. Wash a fresh tongue and cover with boil- 
ing water, and a heaping teaspoonful of salt. Simmer slowly 
for tv»ro and one-half hours if large, two if small; then take it 
out, remove the skin, and trim off anything that may look rag- 
ged about the thick end. Then thrust the point of a skewer 
through the tip of the tongue, turn the thick part of the tongue 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 303 

inward, hold it firmly so until the top is lapped around and the 
skewer driven through both; then take a piece of muslin — part 
of a well-washed flour sack will do — and cut a strip just as wide 
as the tongue; bind this firmly around the tongue and tie with 
twine. Set this aside while the vegetables are being fried. Have 
these prepared while the tongue is boiling. Brown in the braising 
pan two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter; toss in one small car- 
rot, two medium-sized onions, one medium-sized potato, one small 
turnip, all sliced; one bay leaf, a small stalk of celery and two 
sprigs of parsley. Stir these together over a brisk fire till they 
look glossy, taking care that they do not scorch, and add one 
quart of beef stock. If this is not convenient use one quart of the 
water in which the tongue was boiled. Put the tongue in with the 
broth and vegetables; cover and bake. Occasionally turn the 
tongue and stir up the vegetables from the bottom. At the end 
of two hours take out the tongue, untie the twine, take off the 
cloth and remove the skewer. Place the tongue on a pie plate 
or in a dripping pan and put on the upper grate of the oven to 
brown; rub the vegetables and broth through a sieve into a 
saucepan; put on a hot part of the stove and boil rapidly until 
reduced to about a pint. Blend two tablespoonfuls of flour with 
a cupful of tomato juice, and add a pinch of salt, pepper, and a 
scant dessertspoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Stir into the re- 
duced broth and boil up sharply; remove the tongue to a platter. 
Pour this thick, brown, altogether delicious sauce over it; 
sprinkle all with shredded fresh parsley, garnished with thinly 
sliced lemon, and serve at once. When this has once been suc- 
cessfully prepared (and failure is impossible if the directions are 
follov/ed) the dish is sure to become a favorite one. The labor 
is really far less than one would suppose from reading the recipe. 
Alterations of seasoning may be made to suit individual tastes. 
For instance, a pinch of thyme may be used, or a fourth of a 
teaspoonful of curry powder. Celery salt may take the place of 
celery. A tablespoonful of tomato catchup to a little of the broth 
will do if fresh or canned tomatoes cannot be had. 

The tongue that is left over will do nicely for lunch the next 
day. Nannie K. Van Keuren.

Farina Molds — Mix three tablespoonfuls of farina with three- 
quarters teaspoonful of salt and a half cupful of milk (taken from 
full pint). Heat the rest of the milk with a pint of water till 
they boil and stir in the farina mixture. Cook slowly for a half 
hour, pour into jelly glasses, filling each half full, and stand on 
ice over night. Serve in the morning with cream and sugar. 

Fried Perch — Be sure the fish are fresh. Lay the fish on a 
board (outdoors if possible), take a dull knife, and, holding fish 
by the tail, with knife held nearly flat, scrape toward the head. 
See that they are perfectly cleaned; thoroughly rinse and dry, 
then roll lightly in flour. Use beef fat for frying if you have it, 
if not use lard, but never butter for fish, as the color is never so 
good. Be sure that your fat is at the proper temperature before 
putting in your fish. If not sufiiciently experienced to tell when 
the boiling point is reached drop in a bit of bread. If it browns 
in a minute the fat is at the proper heat. As soon as the fish 
is browned on both sides move your pan to the back of the stove, 
cover and let cook slowly. Serve on hot platter garnished with 
sprigs of parsley. 

Sardine Sandwiches — Take the contents of a half-pound box 
of sardines, remove bones and skin and chop them fine. Add two 
eggs, hard-boiled, chopped and seasoned with one-half teaspoon- 
ful of French mustard and one-half teaspoonful of grated horse- 
radish. Mix this well together and spread between thin slices 
of buttered bread or cold biscuits. 

Salem Mufiins — One and one-half cups of flour, half cup of 
cornmeal, one teaspoonful of sugar, half teaspoonful of salt, one 
heaping teaspoonful of baking powder, one level tablespoonful 
of butter, two eggs, and one cup (full measure) milk, 
half teaspoonful of cinnamon. Sift together flour, corn- 
meal, salt, sugar and baking powder; rub in the butter, add the 
eggs, well beaten, milk and cinnamon. Have the griddle well 
heated, grease it, lay on it the muffin rings, also greased, and half 
fill them with the batter. As soon as risen to top of rings, turn 
them over gently with cake turner; bake nice brown on both 
t-ides. They should bake in seven minutes. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 305 

French Pickle — Slice in an earthen jar one peck of green 
tomatoes, six large onions, and pour over them one cup of salt. 
Let stand twenty-four hours and drain. Add one quart of vine- 
gar, three pounds of sugar, one-fourth of a pound of white mus- 
tard seed, one teaspoonful of ground cloves, one of ginger, two of 
mustard, one of cayenne pepper, and cook slowly for fifteen 
minutes. 

Salad of 76 — In making this salad the ingredients must be 
chopped separately and in order given. One teaspoonful of onion 
chopped fine and measured after chopping, five good-sized cold 
boiled potatoes (or enough to fill two cups after they are chopped), 
three hard-boiled eggs chopped not too fine, and the crisp ten- 
der leaves of two heads of lettuce, leaving out enough of the inner 
leaves to line the salad bowl. Pour on a dressing made from 
the following recipe, and mix gently with a silver fork: Yolks 
of two eggs, three-fourths of a cup of sour cream if you have it, 
if not use same quantity of sweet or sour milk thickened with a 
half teaspoonful of corn starch dissolved in tablespoonful of 
cold water; level tablespoonful of sugar, teaspoonful of mixed 
mustard, half teaspoonful of pepper, teaspoonful of salt and half 
a cup of the best vinegar. Mix thoroughly and cook in double 
boiler or over the teakettle till it thickens. This dressing keeps 
well and the quantity is sufiicient for two salads of the size given. 

Snowballs — Cream one-half cupful of butter, add one cupful 
of fine granulated sugar, beat well; mix two level teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder with two cups of flour, add alternately with 
one-half cupful of milk; beat the whites of four eggs very stiff 
and add lightly. Pill buttered cups half full and steam half an 
hour; roll in powdered sugar. The quantity will be sufiicient 
for Sunday's tea as well. 

Consomme a 1' Independence— The stock should be made on 
Friday, but the custard not until Saturday morning. Cut a 
knuckle of veal (10 cents' worth) into four pieces; a quarter of 
a pound of lean ham; one large onion, or two small ones; three 
whole cloves, one piece of mace, and, after it begins to boil, a 
saltspoonful of pepper. Put this into the soup pot and cover 
with two quarts of cold water. Cook until the meat leaves the 
bone. Take off the stove, strain through a sieve and set in a cool 
place until morning. Make the custard as follows: Beat two 
eggs with a spoon, add two tablespoonfuls of milk and one-fourth 
of a teaspoonful of salt. Turn into a buttered cup and place in 
a pan of warm water. Cook in slow oven until firm in the center, 
then set away to cool. When ready to serve cut into small pieces, 
put into the tureen and pour over it four cups of the boiling 
stock diluted with one cup of water. 

Roast Lamb, Mint Sauce — As roast lamb with mint sauce 
seems almost the national dish for the Fourth of July, the most 
economical plan (in fact, the only way one can enjoy genuine 
roast lamb on this allowance) will be to buy a fore-quarter 
and make . it answer for two dinners and convert the rem- 
nants into some savory breakfast or luncheon dish on the 



306 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

third day. It should be roasted in a hot oven, with a cup of warm 
water in the pan, frequently basted, and not salted until nearly 
done, when it should be sprinkled with a liberal teaspoonful. 
Serve with mint sauce made with a half-cup of vinegar boiled 
with two teaspoonfuls of sugar, then poured over a level table- 
spoonful of chopped mint leaves and allowed to stand until it is 
cold. 

Cucumber Fritters — Peel and grate three full-grown, tender 
cucumbers. Press all the juice from the pulp and add to two 
cups of the pulp half a cup of cream, a cup of flour, one table- 
spoonful of melted butter, a level teaspoonful of salt 
and half a saltspoonful of white pepper. Beat four 
eggs, yolks and whites separately, very light, and add to 
the batter, which should be very thick. Have ready a kettle of 
boiling cotosuet and drop in one large spoonful at a time, remov- 
ing as soon as crisp and brown. Serve as you would fried oys- 
ters, which they very much resemble. 

Cherry Roll — As early as convenient in the morning stem 
and pit one box of cherries (those that sell at the rate of three 
boxes for 25 cents), cover with one cup of granulated sugar, and 
let them stand until ready to use. Sift two cups of flour, with 
two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one of sugar and a quarter- 
teaspoonful of salt; rub in two tablespoonfuls of butter and mix 
wfth two-thirds of a cup of milk. Roll out into an oblong sheet 
a half-inch thick, spread with butter, then drain the cherries, 
leaving all the juice for the sauce, lay them upon the dough, 
sprinkle with two tablespoonfuls of sugar, roll up closely and 
pinch the ends that the juice may not escape. Place in a but- 
tered pan and bake in a moderate oven for thirty-five minutes. 
Add enough water to the juice to make a cup and a half of sauce, 
thicken with a teaspoonful of flour dissolved in a tablespoonful 
of cold water, stir in three level tablespoonfuls of sugar and boil 
for three minutes. 

These are intended to be red and white menus, since it is 
impracticable to use the other color of our flag (blue) in arti- 
cles of food. The salad should be garnished with rings of the 
white of a hard-boiled egg and disks cut from boiled beets, while 
the tiny flags sold at two cents a dozen may be used as table 
decorations in connection with the dozens of v/hite sweet clover 
now blossoming so luxuriously in many of our vacant city lots.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 307 

LUNCHEON. 

Cold corned beef sliced thin. 

Thin bread and butter. 

Red raspberries and cream cookies. 



DINNER. 

Fried chicken. 

Flaked potatoes. Deviled tomatoes. 

Green apple pie. Cheese. 

Coffee. 



Breakfast Biscuit — One pint of flour, one rounding teaspoon- 
ful of baking pov/der; sift the flour and baking powder together 
three times; one tablespoonful of lard rubbed thoroughly in the 
flour, one-fourth teaspoon of salt. Mix as soft as possible to 
handle with cold water; roll and cut into biscuit and bake in 
a hot oven twenty minutes. 

Fried Chicken — Take a spring, chicken, dress and cut up as 
for pot pie. Steam for one-half hour, as this makes it more 
juicy and more evenly done; then fry in butter and lard mixed, 
a pale brown; sprinkle with one-half a teaspoonful of salt and 
a dash of pepper while frying. 

Flaked Potatoes — Get potatoes as perfect as possible; boil 
in their skins in salt water for one-half hour; drain dry and 
peel; rub through a coarse sieve onto a hot dish before the fire. 
Do not touch them after this or the flakes will flatten out. Serve 
hot. 

• Deviled Tomatoes — Two or three large, firm tomatoes, not 
over ripe; cut them into slices half an inch thick and lay on a 
sieve. Make a dressing of one tablespoonful of butter and one 
of vinegar rubbed smooth with the yolk of one hard-boiled egg; 
add a teaspoonful of sugar, half a teaspoonful of salt, a fourth 
of a teaspoonful of mustard and a fourth of a saltspoonful of 
cayenne pepper; beat until smooth and heat to a boil. Take from 
the fire and pour upon a well-beaten egg, whipping to a smooth 
cream. Put the vessel containing this dressing in hot water while 
the tomatoes are being thoroughly broiled over a clear fire. Put 
the tomatoes on a hot dish and pour the dressing over them. 
Cooked in this way they are very nice with chicken. 

Apple Pie — Crust: For one pie take two large handfuls of 
flour, a pinch of salt, a piece of lard the size of a turkey's egg, 
rub into the flour until smooth; mix with just enough cold water 
to roll. Filling: Take four or five large tart apples, pare, quar- 
ter and slice thin. Line the pie plate with the crust, place the 
sliced apples on the crust and season with three-fourths cup 
of sugar, a piece of butter size of v/alnut, a half a saltspoon of 
salt and a fourth of a grated nutmeg. Wet the edges of the 
under crust, place the upper crust over the apples and press very 



308 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

closely around the edge; prick the upper crust with a fork to 
keep from blistering. Bake slowly for half an hour. 

Cream Cookies — One and two-thirds cups of sugar, one-half 
cup of butter, one cup of sour cream, three eggs, one-haif tea- 
spoonful of soda, three cups of flour. Do not roll too thin.

Farinose — One cup farinose stirred gradually into one quart 
of boiling water salted with three-quarters of a teaspoonful of 
salt. Cook twenty minutes, stirring occasionally. Serve with 
cream and sugar. (One of the best breakfast foods.) 

Tomato Pickles — Take small tomatoes which have turned 
red, but are still unripe; put them in glass cans together with 
mint leaves. Pour over them hot salted vinegar. 

Great-Aunt Cornbred — Beat one egg with a pinch of salt, 
add one pint of sweet milk, two tablespoonfuls of molasses, but- 
ter size of a butternut (melted). One heaping teaspoon of baking 
powder mixed with part of cornmeal. Stir in cornmeal until 
rather stiff, but not too stiff to pour. 

Stuffed Squash — Choose a small summer squash with tender 
skin, wash it, cut out the stem end, remove the pulp and seeds 
without breaking the squash, mix them with sausage meat or 
cold meat chopped fine, season very highly, replace in the squash 
and bake about three-quarters of an hour. 

Election Cake (over 100 years old) — Two and one-half cups 
raised bread dough, two cups sugar, one-half cup butter, two 
eggs (a little of the white reserved), cinnamon, nutmeg, pinch 
of salt, one-half teaspoon soda, one-half cup stoned and chopped 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 309 

raisins, one-half cup of currants. Beat together sugar, butter 
and eggs until smooth. Beat these into the dough with the hand 
until well mixed. Exchange hand for spoon, stir in spice, salt 
and fruit. Pour into two buttered pans. Cover and let stand in 
warm place one-half hour. The rising will not be perceptible un- 
til subjected to the heat of the oven. Bake one-half hour. When 
done mix sugar with the reserved white of egg until stiff enough 
not to drop from the spoon. Apply with a cloth. 

Iced Chocolate — Four ounces sweet chocolate, one-half cup 
of sugar (scant), one-half pint of water, one quart of cream, one 
teaspoonful of vanilla. Put chocolate, water and sugar in a 
saucepan to melt; stir until smooth. Heat cream in double boil- 
er. When hot add it gradually to the chocolate mixture; beat 
until well mixed. When cold add vanilla, strain and freeze. 

Almond Soup, with Custard — Four ounces shelled sweet al- 
monds; scald and rub off skins; pound to a smooth pulp in a 
mortar, adding a few drops of milk to prevent oiling. Gradually 
mix in a quart of milk and four ounces sugar. Heat over a mod- 
erate fire. Meanwhile mix smoothly the yolks of tv/o eggs, a 
wineglass full of milk and a little salt and pepper. Put into 
small pan rubbed with salad oil, set into larger pan containing 
hot water. Heat until the custard hardens. Cut into thin inch 
strips. When the soup boils mix a half-cup of it with the beat- 
en yolks of two eggs and stir them with the rest. Pour into a 
tureen and cool. Before serving add the strips of custard and a 
little nutmeg. (A hot- weather dish to be eaten cold.) 

Scalloped Mutton or Lamb — Chop fine cold cooked lamb or 
muttpn. Put a layer in bottom of baking dish, then a layer of 
fresh or canned tomatoes, then a layer of bread crumbs, and so 
on until the dish is full. Season well with salt, pepper and but- 
ter. Bake until the bread crumbs are brown. 

Stuffed Eggplant — Cut an eggplant into halves, scoop out 
the flesh, leaving a sufficiently thick rind to hold it in shape. 
Chop the flesh flne and mix with an equal amount of chopped 
bread, two tablespoonfuls melted butter, a teaspoonful of salt, a 
quarter-teaspoon black pepper and a dash of cayenne. Mix thor- 
oughly and put into shells. Lay on top of each a thin slice of 
bacon and bake in a quick oven forty minutes. 

Ginger Water Ice — Six ounces preserved ginger, one quart 
lemon ice. Make lemon ice as follows: Pour large juicy lemons, 
one quart water, one orange, one and one-quarter pounds sugar. 
Boil sugar, water and rind of lemons and orange five minutes. 
Cool it and add juice of orange and lemons, strain and freeze. 
Pound four ounces of the ginger to a paste, cut the other two 
ounces into very thin slices and stir these into the lemon ice. 
Repack and stand away to ripen. Mrs. H. R. Hillyer.

WEDNESDAY, JULY THE SEVENTH. 
[This meal is planned for bread-baking day.] 



BREAKFAST. 

Broiled white fish. Stewed potatoes. 

Breadsticks. 

Coffee. 



LUNCHEON. 

Baked eggs. French rolls. 

Radishes. 

Milk custard. Iced tea. 



DINNER. 

Turbot a la creme. 

Sliced tomatoes. 

Baked tongue. Sauce Hollandaise. 

Potato in pyramids. 

Raspberries and cream. 



Stewed Potatoes — Slice a generous pint of cold boiled pota- 
toes. Put into a saucepan butter the size of a pigeon's egg, and 
when it bubbles add an even teaspoonful of flour — the sauce not 
to be thick — which cook a moment and then pour in a cupful of 
milk — or better, cream. Season with a half -teaspoonful of salt and 
one-quarter teaspoonful of pepper. Stir slowly until it boils up, 
then mix in the potato slices. When thoroughly hot they are 
ready to be served. 

Breadsticks — Set bread at night. In the morning, after knead- 
ing, take from the dough a piece equal to one-quarter loaf. 
Cut and roll into pieces three-quarters of an inch thick and four 
inches long. Place in a pan an inch apart and set in a warm 
place for half an hour. Bake in a moderate oven ten minutes. 
Serve hot. Practice alone makes perfect the shape and color of 
the sticks. 

Rolls — When the bread is ready to put into the pans take 
dough equal to one loaf and add one tablespoonful each. of butter 
and lard and sugar. Mold into biscuits and put in a pan — not 
too close together. Let them rise for an hour, or until light, and 
bake quickly in a hot oven. If desired hot for lunch, put the 
dough, before molding, into the ice chest until an hour and a 
half before luncheon. These biscuits cut in half and toasted in 
a nioderately hot oven make delicious rusk for breakfast the next 
day. 

Baked Eggs — Butter well individual fish-baking dishes and 
into each drop a fresh egg. Sprinkle over each a pinch of salt 
and pepper. Then cover with a tfeick layer of fine dry bread 
crumbs and scatter bits butter on top, about one-half teaspoonful 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 311 

to an egg. Bake in a quick oven until brown — about five min- 
utes. (Some consider the addition of a little grated cheese be- 
fore baking or a little mayonnaise dressing when served an im- 
provement.) 

Milk Custard — This is a dish which, considering its cheapness 
and delicacy, is little used. It is a refreshing dish for a hot day 
— especially excellent for children, who can make an entire meal 
from it. Buy a bottle of liquid rennet, made by James T. Shinn 
of Philadelphia, price eighteen cents (all good grocers carry it). 
This will keep any length of time. To one quart of milk, slight- 
ly warmed, add one tablespoonful of liquid rennet, stirring only 
enough to mix it thoroughly. It should stand on or near the ice 
for an hour before serving. Mix a tablespoonful of cinnamon in 
a cupful of sugar and sprinkle over the. custard as served, add- 
ing cream. 

Iced Tea — The most economical way to prepare iced tea is to 
make a pot of rather strong oolong tea, early in the morning. 
Pour a pint of fresh boiling water slowly on three heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of tea, cover tightly and set one side — not over the 
fire. When perfectly cold, pour off the tea from the leaves and 
set on the ice. Have a large bottle of filtered water lying on 
the ice and just before serving, add one quart of this water to 
the tea. Serve in glasses v/ith a slice of lemon and sugar to taste. 
Small lumps of ice may be added if desired. 

(A more delicate tea, but more expensive, can be made with 
cold water. Pour the entire quantity of water to be used on twice 
the quantity of tea used with boiling water and let it stand 
from six to twelve hours before serving. The cold water ex- 
tracts the refreshing qualities of the tea without the astringent.) 

Turbot a la creme — Pick the bones from the white-fish left 
from breakfast (a little freshened codfish can be added if there is 
not a pint of white). Make a sauce of a pint of milk, a few sprigs 
of parsley and a slice of onion; simmer together until well fiav- 
ored; wet one tablespoonful of flour and stir in v/ith butter half 
the size of an egg. Season with a teaspoonful of salt and one- 
quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper. (If codfish is used take one- 
half the quantity of salt.) Use individual fish dishes. Put a lit- 
tle sauce in dish, then a layer of fish, and so on, putting sauce on 
top. Cover with rolled crackers or bread crumbs and brown in 
a moderately heated oven. 

Baked Tongue — Get a beef tongue weighing from three to 
four pounds, either fresh, or better, corned one or two days. Put 
it into a pot of boiling water enough to cover it and let it boil 
gently without stopping until the skin will slip easily from it, 
about tv/o hours and a half. Have a teakettle of boiling water 
to replenish as the water boils away, just keeping the tongue cov- 
ered. If the tongue is fresh add one tablespoonful of salt to the 
water in which it is boiled. When done skin it, rub with butter, 
sprinkle thoroughly with bread crumbs and bake twenty min- 
utes. Serve hot with sauce Hollandaise. (There will be enough 
cold tongue left for a lunch or a Sunday supper.) 



812 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Sauce Hollandaise— Mix well the yolks of two eggs in one 
tablespoonful of cold water. Add one tablespoonful of lemon 
juice, one teaspoonful of salt and a quarter teaspoonful of cay- 
enne pepper. Boil in a double pan and beat until the butter 
melts and it rises to a froth. 

Potato Pyramids — Mold mashed potato in after-dinner cof- 
fee cups or molds. Turn out, sprinkle with crumbs and little 
bits of butter and brown in the oven. Cold mashed potato can 
be utilized in this way. 

Sliced Tomatoes — When used as a vegetable should be served 
plain, allowing each member of the family to use for dressing 
salt, pepper, oil or vinegar, one, all or none, to taste. Great 
care should be taken in the selection of the tomatoes to have 
them perfectly ripe and never overripe. They should be solid and 
served very cold. Calculate one moderate-sized tomato to a per- 
son. Elizabeth H. Baird. 

No. 465 Dearborn Avenue, Chicago. 



THURSDAY, JULY THE EIGHTH.

Blueberries and milk. 

Summer sausage. Potato klosse. 

Bread balls. Coffee.

Bread and butter. 
Wild red plums. Spice cookies. 

Royal spruce beer. 



DINNER. 

Toast soup. 

Stuffed beefsteak, sauce piquante. 

Ragout of vegetables. Watermelon. 

Coffee. 



Summer Sausage — One heaping cup boiled beef, chopped; one 
heaping cup bread crumbs; one tablespoonful of flour; one salt- 
spoonful of salt; three dashes of pepper; one-half teaspoonful 
of powdered sage; one-half teaspoonful of powdered marjoram; 
thyme and celery salt mixed. Moisten with one-half cup boil- 
ing water; mix well and make into cakes like sausage and fry 
in butter. 

Potato Klosse — Beat a pound of boiled potatoes to a smooth 
pulp, and while still warm add one-half teaspoonful of salt, one- 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 313 

half saltspoonful of pepper, two ounces butter, slightly melted, 
one tablespoonful finely minced parsley and two well-beaten eggs. 
Beat well, then drop the preparation, a tablespoonful at a time, 
into deep boiling fat, dipping the spoon each time into boiling 
water and being careful in dropping them to retain the shape of 
the spoon. Fry until a golden brown (about two minutes), then 
drain on blotting paper and pile up tastefully on a hot plate and 
garnish with parsley. 

Bread Balls — Allow well-worked bread dough, made of the 
whitest flour, to become very light. Butter the hands, pinch off 
small bits and roll into round balls, making one dozen. Put 
them into warmed and greased gem irons. Let them become 
light, prick with a fork, turn a pan over them, and bake in a 
quick oven. They should be a delicate brown and as nearly 
round as possible. 

Tongue Salad — Mix together one cupful cold tongue cut in 
dice, a sprig of parsley minced fine, one-half teaspoonful of salt, 
one saltspoonful of pepper, one hard-boiled egg cut fine, and a 
tablespoonful and a half of Durkee's salad dressing. Line a salad 
bowl with crisp lettuce leaves, put in the tongue mixture and 
garnish with a hard-boiled egg, sliced, and a few celery tips; then 
pour over a teaspoonful of the dressing. If a salt tongue is used 
no more salt will be required. 

Spice Cookies — One cup of sugar, a heaping tablespoonful 
and a half of butter, creamed together, one-half cup of sour milk, 
into which has been stirred one-half teaspoonful soda. Add a 
scant half-teaspoonful of cloves, a half-teaspoonful each of cin- 
namon, nutmeg, vanilla and almond extract and one saltspoonful 
of ginger. Mix very stiff and roll very thin. Sprinkle granulat- 
ed sugar over before baking. This makes about three dozen. 

Royal Spruce Beer — Three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, 
one gallon of water, one-quarter ounce of ginger, the grated rind 
of two lemons and a teaspoonful essence of spruce. Add one-half 
cake yeast, dissolved in a half-cup of water. Let it ferment; 
strain, and bottle air-tight. 

Toast Soup — Brown two heaping tablespoonfuls of butter in 
a kettle. Break four slices of toast in bits and stir them in the 
butter. Pour four teacupfuls of boiling water over and add one- 
half teaspoonful salt, one saltspoonful of pepper and half a cup 
of good cream — more if the cream is thin. Let it just come to a 
boil and serve. This is a very delicate soup. 

Stuffed Beefsteak — Take a tender slice of round steak an 
inch thick, remove the bone, trim and spread with stufiing, roll 
up and tie with a string. Have ready a dripping-pan in which 
you have fried two slices of salt pork. Put in the roll and brown; 
then put in half a cup of hot water and sprinkle a saltspoonful 
of salt and half a saltspoonful of pepper over the meat. Cover 
closely and cook one-half hour. Serve with sauce piquante poured 
over. 

Stuffing — One-half pint bread crumbs, one teaspoonful of 
summer savory, one-quarter teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoon- 



314 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

fill of pepper, a tablespoonful of butter and one teacup boiling 
water. Stir all together and spread on the steak. 

Sauce Piquante— Heat one cupful liquor from tongue or any 
kind of beef, skim and season with a saltspoonful of salt and two 
dashes of pepper. Stir in a heaping tablespoonful of browned 
flour, wet up in a quarter of a cup of cold water. As it thickens 
put in one tablespoonful of butter, one-half teaspoonful minced 
parsley and one-half teaspoonful sweet marjoram, one tablespoon- 
ful onion vinegar and one teaspoonful of made mustard. Boil up 
and serve. 

Ragout of Vegetables — Parboil one carrot, two potatoes, one 
cup string beans, one cup green peas, one onion and a quarter 
of a pound of salt pork. Drain and take out the salt pork. 
Slice the potatoes, carrot and onion; add one sliced tomato, one 
cup of stock, two teaspoonfuls of butter, and a saltspoonful of 
pepper. Cook all together one-half hour and serve. 

A half a watermelon can be bought at most places, and this 
will be sufficient for five persons.

dish, and do not press down the edge. Bake in a moderate oven. 
Meanwhile make a custard by placing a cup of cream or rich milk 
over the fire in a double boiler and when it comes to the boiling 
point stir in half a teaspoonful of corn starch, moistened with 
a little cold milk and one tablespoonful of sugar. Beat light the 
whites of two eggs and add to the mixture. Cook a moment be- 
fore taking from the fire. Stand the dish containing the custard 
in a pan of cold water and stir until the custard is cold. ¥/hen 
the pie is baked, carefully remove the top crust and pour the cold 
custard over the fruit. Replace the crust and allow the pie to be- 
come cool before serving. 

Eggplant, French Style — Boil a large eggplant until tender; 
peel and mash smooth, season with one tablespoonful butter, one 
half saltspoonful pepper, one level teaspoonful salt and a little 
thyme. Chop fine two hard-boiled eggs and one-half an onion.

egg. Put the milk on to boil; add the meat, rice and the season- 
ing; when this boils add the egg, well beaten; stir one minute, 
remove from the fire and when cool shape like croquettes; dip 
in beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs and fry in hot fat till 
brown. 

Coffee Rolls — Sift one and one-half quarts of flour into a 
pan; to this add one-half teaspoonful of salt, one pint of cold 
water and one cupful of soft yeast; mix into a loaf and let rise 
over night. In the morning work into the dough a rounded table- 
spoonful of butter, half a teacupful of white sugar and half a cup- 
ful of English currants which have been well washed and dried in 
the oven; before putting them in sift some flour and sugar over 
them, then work them into the dough thoroughly, make into long 
rolls, dip into melted butter, place in pan, let them rise and when 
light bake in a quick oven fifteen minutes. These are very nice. 

Fried Calves' Brains — Soak the brains for an hour in cold 
water, then boil for twenty minutes in water containing a small 
onion, three sprigs of parsley, a saltspoonful of salt and a table- 
spoonful of vinegar; throw them into cold water to blanch, re- 
move the skins and fibers, then cut in slices, dip them in a bat- 
ter made of one well-beaten egg, one tablespoonful of flour, a 
mite of salt and one-half cupful of milk. Fry to a light brown 
and serve on a hot platter. 

Tomatoes Dressed Individually — Take five tomatoes that are 
fully ripe but firm and smooth, peel them, cut in halves, take out 
the most of the pulp and seeds, being careful not to break the out- 
side. Make a French dressing of one tablespoonful of strong vin- 
egar, three of salad oil, one-half teaspoonful of salt and a salt- 
spoonful of pepper; mix the pulp and seeds with the dressing, re- 
turn to the halves of tomatoes, set each half on a fresh leaf of let- 
tuce on an individual dish and serve. 

Mutton Soup — Two pounds of coarse, lean, chopped mutton 
(the scrag makes good soup and costs little); half an onion, sliced; 
one cup of milk, half a cup of raw rice, two quarts of cold water, 
one teaspoonful of salt. Put the meat into the cold water with 
the onion and simmer four hours; when nearly done add the salt, 
set away until cold, then skim and strain; return to the pot with 
the rice, which has been soaked for three hours, simmer half an 
hour, turn in the milk, which has been heated, stir and serve. 

Baked Liver — Get a calf's liver, wash thoroughly and wipe 
dry. Cut a long, deep hole in the side, make a stuffing with one 
pint bread crumbs, three slices of bacon and an onion chopped 
fine, a few sprinkles of pepper, one teaspoonful of butter and a 
beaten egg (no more salt will be needed in the stuffing than the 
bacon furnishes), sprinkle a saltspoonful of salt into the inci- 
sion, then put in the stuffing, sew or tie together, lard it over, 
sprinkle a teaspoonful of salt on the outside, dredge with flour, 
put in the roasting pan with a cup of water and bake two hours. 

Browned Quirled Potatoes — Pare a half dozen good-sized old 
potatoes (old potatoes are best if put into cold water when put 
on to cook), let them cook until thoroughly done; 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. S17 

drain, mash and season with one-half cupful milk, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and a tablespoonful of butter; beat them well, press 
through a colander into the serving dish, do not let colander touch 
potatoes or dish, and set in the oven till nicely browned. 

Wax Beans — Wash well and cut the ends from the beans and 
cut in two or three pieces; two quarts of beans will be sufficient; 
throw into boiling water, to which has been added a heaping tea- 
spoonful of salt. The water should only commence to boil when 
they are put in, as long boiling makes the water flat and taste- 
less and the vegetables will not look well or have a good flavor. 
Cook the beans one hour and season with a teaspoonful of but- 
ter, some pepper and one-half cup of good milk. Do not cover 
while cooking. The water should be almost boiled away before 
the seasoning is put in. 

Currant Pudding — Put one cupful of tapioca into a small 
strainer and let cold water run through it to cleanse it; pour 
boiling water over it and cook in a double boiler until the tapioca 
is transparent; add one-fourth teaspoonful of salt; stir often 
while cooking. Pick over one quart ripe currants and wash them, 
put them in a glass dish, sprinkle over them two cupfuls of white 
sugar, turn the hot tapioca very slowly over them and after it has 
cooled a little set on the ice to get very cold. When served with 
cream this makes a delicious and cool summer dessert.

saltspoonful of salt. When cool shape into small ovals, roll in 
crumbs, dip in beaten eggs, roll in crumbs again and fry in 
smoking-hot fat. 

Thirded Bread — One cup white flour, one cup rye flour, one 
cup yellow cornmeal, three tablespoonfuls sugar, one teaspoonful 
salt, one-half cake compressed yeast dissolved in one scant half- 
cup water. Mix these ingredients with milk, scalded and cooled, 
till thick enough to be shaped into a loaf. Let the loaf rise till 
it cracks open. Put into a pan and when light bake one hour. 

Potted Fish — Chop and pound to a paste all the fragments of 
cooked fish you have. Season highly, using the proportion of 
one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of made mus- 
tard, one-half saltspoonful black pepper and three dashes cayenne 
to a pint of the paste. Moisten with a little melted butter. Pack 
closely in small stone jars. Put the jars in a steamer and heat 
for half an hour. Then press the meat down again and cover with 
hot melted butter. This will keep for a long time and may be 
served in slices or used for sandwiches. Remnants of tongue and 
poultry are very nice prepared in this way. 

London Crumpets^Three cups flour, one-half teaspoonful salt, 
one teaspoonful sugar, two teaspoonfuls baking powder, one egg, 
one pint milk, one teaspoonful cinnamon. Sift together flour, 
salt, sugar and powder; add beaten egg, milk and extract; mix 
into a firm batter. Heat a well-greased griddle and on it set 
greased muffin rings. Half fill the rings, bake on both sides, and 
when done serve hot with cottage cheese. 

Cottage Cheese — One quart sour milk, one teaspoonful butter, 
one saltspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful cream; place the milk 
in a pan on the back of the stove and scald it until the curd has 
separated from the whey; spread a strainer cloth over a bowl, 
pour in the milk and drain till quite dry; put the curd in a bowl 
with the butter, salt and cream; mix to a smooth paste with the 
hand, then roll into small balls. 

One-Egg Cake— Cream together one cup sugar and butter the 
size of an egg; add one beaten egg; into this stir two-thirds of 
a cup of milk and half a teaspoonful of vanilla; sift two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder with two scant cups of flour and add 
gradually; bake thirty minutes in a moderate oven. 

Raspberry Vinegar — To four quarts red raspberries put enough 
vinegar to cover; let stand twenty-four hours; scald and strain 
it; add a pound of sugar to one pint of juice; boil twenty min- 
utes and bottle; it is then ready for use and will keep for years; 
to a glass of ice-water add two tablespoonfuls; it is very refresh- 
ing. 

Roast Veal—Get three pounds from the loin and dredge with 
salt, pepper and flour. Put strips of salt pork over the top. Allow 
half an hour to the pound and cover with a buttered paper to 
keep the meat from burning. Add water when the flour has 
browned and baste often. When done take up the roast, add more 
water if needed and make a brown gravy from the liquor in the 
pan. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 319 

Summer Squash — Summer squashes are good only when 
young and fresh. Wash and cut into small pieces. The skin and 
seeds need not be removed. Cook in boiling, salted water twenty 
minutes. Place the squash in a strainer or cloth and squeeze un- 
til the squash is dry. Turn into a basin, add two tablespoonfuls 
of cream or milk, a tablespoonful of butter, a saltspoonful of salt, 
a half saltspoonful of pepper and heat again before serving. 

Stuffed Tomatoes — Cut a thin slice from the stem end of six 
tomatoes. Remove the pulp and mix with it an equal amount of 
buttered cracker crumbs. Mix with this a teaspoonful of salt, 
three dashes of pepper and a few drops of onion juice. Pill the 
tomato skins with the mixture and sprinkle buttered crumbs over 
the top. Bake till the crumbs are brown. 

Baked Berry Roll — One pint of flour sifted with one heaping 
teaspoonful of baking powder; mix into this one tablespoonful 
of butter or lard and one-half teaspoonful of salt; add three- 
quarters of a cup of milk and roll out one-third of an inch thick. 
Spread thickly with any kind of berries, sift sugar over and roll. 
Bake half an hour and serve hot with fruit sauce. 

Fruit Sauce — Cream together one-half cup of sugar and one 
tablespoonful of butter; add one beaten egg, one cup of mashed 
berries, and one cup of boiling milk. Wet one teaspoonful of 
corn starch in enough milk to dissolve it and stir in slowly. Let 
all boil together three minutes and serve,

320 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Hashed Veal— Chop fine cold roast veal, or veal cooked in aay 
style will answer. Moisten with two tablespoonfuls of veal gravy 
or water. When hot break into it four eggs. If you have a cupful 
of veal, if not half a cup of fine stale bread crumbs will answer 
nicely to make the quantity, add a large saltspoonful of salt. Stir 
the eggs until cooked, add a tablespoonful of butter and a tea- 
spoonful of chopped parsley, if liked. Serve quickly. 

Avena Gems — Take one and one-half cups of cold cooked 
"avena." Season with a half-teaspoon of salt (if none was used in 
cooking), add two-thirds cup of milk (part cream is better) and 
white flour to make quite a stiff batter. Beat well, drop in hot 
gem pans, bake quickly. They are light, tender, sweet and very 
palatable. 

Swiss Sandwiches — Mix equal parts of grated Swiss cheese 
and chopped English walnut meat. Season slightly with salt and 
cayenne. Spread between thin slices of bread, slightly buttered, 
and cut in fancy shapes. 

Savoy Cakes — Beat together for twenty minutes the yolks 
of six eggs and one-half of a pound of powdered sugar. When 
light and thick add one-half of a pound of sifted pastry flour, the 
grated rind and juice of one lemon and four ounces of corn starch. 
Whip the whites of the eggs to a stiff, dry froth and carefully 
cut them in. Bake in a quick oven in finger molds that have been 
buttered, then dusted with flour and sugar. 

Tomato Farci — Cut four tomatoes in halves, place them in a 
frying-pan, the open side down, in one-half inch deep of hot fat. 
Move them about until they are cooked a little tender. Lift them 
from the pan carefully and place them side by side in a baking- 
dish. Pour around them two tablespoonfuls of sweet oil, sprin- 
kled with a tablespoonful of chopped onion, one of parsley, a 
half-teaspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonful of pepper and a good 
pinch of cayenne. Bake in hot oven twenty minutes and serve 
in same dish. 

Raspberry Foam — Soak half a package of gelatine in half a 
cup of cold water until soft; heat to boiling two and one-half 
cups of red raspberry juice; sweeten to taste and turn over the 
soaked gelatine. Stir until perfectly dissolved, then strain and 
set the dish in ice water to cool. When cold beat the whites 
of three eggs to a stiff froth and stir into the thickening gela- 
tine. Beat until the whole is a solid foam stiff enough to retain 
its shape. Turn into small molds previously wet with cold water, 
then pile roughly in a dish. Serve with whipped cream.

currants, dip into beaten white of egg, put in sieve so that they 
will not touch each other, sift powdered sugar thickly over them 
and put in a warm place till dry. Cherries and grapes may be 
prepared in the same way. 

Codfish Croquettes— One pint bowlful of raw fish, two heap- 
ing bowlfuls of pared potatoes (let the potatoes be under medium 
size), four tablespoonfuls of milk, butter the size of an egg, one- 



324 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

eighth of a teaspoon of pepper. Pick the fish very fine and meas- 
ure it lightly in the bowl. Put the potatoes into the boiler and 
the fish on top of them; then cover with boiling water and boil 
half an hour. Drain off all the water and mash fish and pota- 
toes together until fine and light. Then add the butter, pep- 
per and the milk. Beat well. When cool roll into cro- 
quettes, dip in egg and bread crumbs and fry a light brown in 
boiling fat. 

Waffles — Mix together one pint of flour and one pint of milk 
to a smooth paste; add one-half of small cup of butter, barely 
melted; add to this the well-beaten yolks of three eggs, then 
the beaten whites, and just before baking two teaspoonfuls of bak- 
ing powder. Beat very hard for two minutes and bake in a very 
hot iron. This recipe is delicious and never fails. 

Chicken Terrapin — Cut up the remains of cold chicken into 
small pieces, being careful not to get any skin in the dish. Put 
into a skillet or chafing-dish one-half pint of cream or rich milk. 
Mix together one tablespoon of flour and one of butter, and when 
the cream comes to a boil stir this in. Season with a small half- 
teaspoon of salt and a dash of pepper. Have ready two hard- 
boiled eggs, chopped fine, mix with the chicken and stir into the 
thickened cream. Let the mixture come to a boil and serve. This 
is a delightful way to use up the "odds and ends" of chicken. 

Barberries — Two cups of raisins, seeded and chopped, one- 
half pound of chopped citron, one cup sugar; juice of one lemon, 
one-half cup of water. Stew all together five minutes. Line 
small patty pans with rich pie crust filled with the above mixture,

in a cool place for several days. 

Canelon of Beef — Two pounds of the round of beef, the rind 
of half a lemon, three sprigs of parsley, one teaspoon of salt, one- 
fourth teaspoon of pepper, one-eighth of a nutmeg, two table- 
spoons melted butter, one raw egg and half a teaspoon of onion 
juice. Chop meat, parsley and lemon rind very fine. Add other 
ingredients and mix thoroughly. Shape into a roll about three 
inches in diameter and six in length. Roll in buttered paper, tie 
securely and bake thirty minutes, basting with butter and water. 
When cooked place in a hot dish, gently unroll from the paper and 
serve with Flemish sauce, tomato or mushroom sauce, or any 
other you may prefer. There will be enough left to serve cold for 
the following day's luncheon. 

Flemish Sauce — Cut a cupful of carrots into very small dice. 
Cover with boiling water and simmer one hour. Put three table- 
spoons of butter, two of flour, a slice of carrot, an onion cut fine, 
a blade of mace and twenty peppercorns in a sauce-pan. Stir over 
the fire one minute and add two cupfuls of any kind of seasoned 
meat stock. Simmer gently half an hour. Add a cupful of milk, 
boil up once and strain. Now add the cooked carrot, one table- 
spoon chopped parsley, two of chopped cucumber pickles, and, 
if you like, one of grated horseradish. Taste to see if salt enough. 

Tomato Jelly Salad — Take eight good-sized tomatoes, remove 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 325 

skins and stew gently ten minutes with a slice of onion, six 
cloves, a sprinkling of pepper and a half teaspoon of salt. Pass 
this through a sieve to remove seeds, etc. Stand it on back of 
stove and stir into it one-half box of gelatine dissolved in a 
small half-cup of boiling water. Strain through a cloth into 
glasses wet in cold water, and set away to harden. There should 
be a pint and a half in all. Serve in slices on lettuce leaves with 
mayonnaise dressing. This may be prepared with canned toma- 
toes also. 

Peach Charlotte — Soak one-third of a box of gelatine in one- 
third of a cup of cold water till soft, then pour in one-third cup 
of boiling water, one cup of sugar, juice of one lemon. Strain 
sufficient canned or freshly stewed peaches through a sieve to 
make a cupful and add it to the other ingredients. Stir all to- 
gether in a dish set in cold water, and when the mixture begins 
to harden beat in the stiffly beaten whites of three eggs. Pour into 
a mold. Serve with whipped cream. Mrs. S. C. Parks, Jr.

tablespoonful of lard and a level teaspoonful of salt; put in a deep 
breadpan and make a hole in the flour, into which pour one pint 
of cold, boiled milk, and one-half cup of yeast. Cover the pan 
and let it stand all night. In the morning stir it up and knead

(it will rise in one and one-half hours), then roll it out on the 
board about one-half inch thick; cut with an oval cutter and fold 
each one together through the center, placing a bit of butter in 
each crease. Lay them on thin sheets; let them rise an hour and 
then bake in a quick oven fifteen minutes.

chicken. Lower kettle and cook slowly for two hours. Now add 
two bay leaves, one onion with six cloves and a blade of mace; 
cover and cook slowly one hour longer; strain and stand aside 
to cool. When cold next day skim off all the fat and turn the 
soup, without sediment, into a kettle; bring to boiling point; 
moisten three tablespoonfuls of arrow-root in a little cold water, 
add it to boiling soup and stir boiling again. Season with salt, 
pepper, and add one-half teaspoonful of soup greens chopped 
fine. Strain and it is ready for use. 

Boiled Bass with Mushrooms — Clean a fine bass and sew up 
in a thin cloth. Put into boiling water in which you have mixed 
four tablespoonfuls of vinegar, with six whole black peppers and 
a little salt. Cook about twelve minutes to the pound. I*repare a 
cupful of drawn butter, boil half can of mushrooms twenty min- 
utes, drain, chop up and stir, with the juice of half a lemon and a 
little pepper, into the drawn butter. Simmer together three min- 
utes, put the fish upon a hot dish and pour one-third of the sauce 
over it, serving the rest in a boat. 

Baked Cauliflower — Wash a large head of cauliflower, put it 
into boiling salt water and boil rapidly for five minutes. Then 
push it back where it cannot possibly boil for thirty minutes. 
Drain carefully, put it into a baking dish, cover over it a pint 
of cream sauce, dust with Parmesan cheese and run it into a hot 
oven for fifteen minutes. 

Frozen Custard — Beat the yolks of four eggs until creamy; 
pour into them two quarts of scalding milk; add two cups of 
sugar; return to the fire and stir for just a minute; add a quarter 
of an ounce of gelatine that has been soaking a half-hour in one-

half cup of cold water; strain and flavor. When perfectly cold, 
freeze. 

Sweet Wafers — Beat to a cream in a warm bowl two ounces 
of butter and ten ounces of fine granulated sugar. Add three 
eggs, one at a time, and beat thoroughly after each is added. Sift 
on this mixture one-half pound of flour and gradually pour over 
it one-half pint of milk, beating until smooth. Drop on buttered 
tins, two or three inches apart, half-tablespoonfuls and spread over 
tins in rounds. Angela Harrison.

DINNER. 

Vegetable soup.

Melons — A good, sweet melon is very cool and refreshing on 
a hot morning. The rough, green coat and deep indentations 
changing to a golden tint, give promise of food fit for "the gods." 
Place the melon on ice until it is thoroughly chilled, then cut 
open and scrape out the seeds, fill the cavity with finely cracked 
ice and serve. 

Codfish — Maitre d' Hotel — Remove the skin and bones from 
three slices of fresh codfish and cut each slice in two pieces; 
season with one teaspoonful of salt and one-half teaspoonful of 
pepper; dust with flour; dip the pieces in beaten eggs, cover 
them with cracker crumbs and fry in hot fat. 

Have ready a dressing made by stirring one ounce of butter 
to a cream, to which you have added one tablespoon of lemon 
juice, one tablespoon of fine-chopped parsley and one-eighth tea- 
spoon of nutmeg; spread this over the fish and serve while hot. 

Cereal with Fruit — I have transferred this dish from break- 
fast to luncheon as being more appetizing that time of day, and 



328 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

also because cream and fish do not readily assimilate in the 
digestive organs of most persons. 

Take five large, firm, sour apples, pare and core, care being 
taken to leave a good-sized cavity in the center slightly larger 
at one end than the other. Cook these in a sirup made by boil- 
ing for five minutes one cupful of sugar in two cupfuls of water, 
flavored with one-inch piece of stick cinnamon and a few shav- 
ings from the yellow rind of a lemon. Turn the apples once, 
carefully; when done lift with a skimmer and place in a pretty 
bowl, the larger end of the cavity upward. Having cooked your 
favorite cereal, fill each cavity heaping full with it and pour the 
boiling sirup over all. Serve either hot or cold with cream, and 
I will guarantee your little ones will not longer refuse the health- 
giving food. 

Frozen Bananas — Cut six bananas crosswise in very thin 
slices; add half-pound of powdered sugar to them, let stand an 
hour, then add a quart of water and the grated peel of a lemon. 
When the sugar is dissolved put all in a freezer and freeze as 
you would ice cream. A pint of cream, whipped stiff, may be 
added if liked. Serve with whatever kind of cake is most con- 
venient. These frozen things suit better for luncheon than after 
a heavy dinner, and take the place of tea or coffee. 

Roasted Calf's Heart — Take a calf's heart and wash it thor- 
oughly in cold water; cut out the veins and arteries. Make a 
stuffing with one heaping tablespoonful of bread crumbs, one 
tablespoonful of chopped onions, one saltspoonful of powdered 
sage, one-half a saltspoonful of salt and a quarter of a teaspoon- 
ful of pepper. Moisten with milk or water, put into the cavity 
caused by the removal of the arteries and sew the edges together. 
Put in a deep dish and half cover with boiling water in which an 
onion has been placed. Bake in a hot oven one hour, basting 
every ten minutes; add more water if necessary. When half 
cooked add a half teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pep- 
per. When the heart is done you may make a gravy by thicken- 
ing the water that is left in the dish with a teaspoonful flour 
wet in cold water. You will find this a very nice occasional dish 
for dinner and a very inexpensive one. 

Salad a la Columbine — Skin five medium-sized smooth red 
tomatoes, place each in a cup and barely cover with seasoned 
gelatine. When cold and ready to serve, turn out and place a 
spoonful of mustard dressing on each. 

Corn Pudding — Take six small or four large ears of corn, cut 
the thinnest possible shaving from the rows of corn on the cob; 
then a heavier layer, and so on until it is all cut off. This is 
much nicer than grating or scraping, as it is not so mushy and 
does not make the pudding so solid. There should be about two 
cups of this pulp. Take two eggs well beaten, stir in the corn, 
add a level tablespoonful of butter, three-quarters of a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and a quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper; stir thor- 
oughly and gradually add two cups of sweet milk. Pour into a 
pudding dish and bake three-quarters of an hour in a moderate 
oven. Serve hot with the meat- 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. S29 

Blackberry Cobbler — This is a southern dish sometimes called 
"family pie." Take a yellow pudding dish, line it with pastry and 
fill with ripe, luscious blackberries or dewberries well picked 
over (it will take about a pint and a half). Sprinkle with sugar 
and cover with a top crust, which has been rolled thin, douDied 
together and gashed with a knife; open out plate on top ana 
press the edges down with a fork, unless you have learned the 
art from some "old mammy" of making a rolled edge with the 
thumb and finger. Bake slowly one-half hour and serve with 
cream or butter and sugar. This is also good cold if any should 
be left over, which is not probable. . Alice J. Withrow.

Berry roll with sauce. Coffee. 



Stuffed Calf's Heart — If people only knew how delicious a 
calf's heart is, it would be more popular and the butchers would 
ask more than 10 cents for it. In Prance it is considered a deli- 
cacy. Make stuffing as for a turkey of a cup of bread crumbs 
seasoned with teaspoon butter, quarter-teaspoonful salt and three 
dashes of pepper, with a pinch of sage or thyme. Fill the cavity 
full, tie a buttered paper over end to keep in place. Bake for one 
hour, basting often. Thicken the gravy with browned flour. Gar- 
nish the dish with spring onions size silver dollar, boiled almost 
done, then put in pan with the heart to finish cooking and brown 
slightly. 

Rice with Tomato Sauce — Three-quarters of a cup of rice 
cooked in milk boiler; do not stir. When done, while yet hot, 
mold into cones by putting into egg cups for five minutes and 
turning out on to platter. Boil, strain three large tomatoes, 
thicken with tablespoon flour; one-half teaspoonful salt, one- 



330 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

quarter salt spoonful of pepper, one tablespoon butter; pour 
very hot on rice cones. 

Cornstarch Pudding — One pint rich milk, two tablespoons of 
cornstarch moistened with a little of the milk, three tablespoons 
of sugar, two eggs well beaten; heat milk to near boiling; add 
one-half teaspoon salt, the sugar, then the dissolved cornstarch; 
stir constantly; when uniformly smooth add the eggs and let 
boil two minutes; pour into mold to cool. When turned out for 
table pour over it the crushed fruit. Prepare this by crushing 
a box of red raspberries or other fruit with three-quarters cup of 
powdered sugar and three tablespoons of water; stir well; allow 
to stand one hour. 

Asparagus Soup — Get a small, lean beef bone (5 cents); sim- 
mer two hours; allow three bunches of asparagus to boil three- 
quarters of an hour in pot; do not unite these until done; then 
cut off the tender tips of two bunches and return to soup; re- 
serve the other for our vegetable salad; rub the asparagus stalks 
through the colander until all pulp has dropped into the pot; add 
to one-half pint of rich milk one teaspoon of salt, one-half tea- 
spoon of white pepper; heat and thicken with heaping tablespoon 
of flour; pour into soup and allow it to boil up once. A delicious, 
creamy soup. 

Vegetable Salad — Line platter with crisp lettuce leaves. 
Cut up and place upon it one crisp cucumber. Three firm toma- 
toes, tips of one bunch of asparagus saved from soup, and three 
beets thoroughly done and cooled. Pour over mayonnaise dress- 
ing. 

Berry Roll — Make rich biscuit dough; roll out into one large 
square (or two smaller ones). In center of square heap berries, 
cherries or any fresh fruit, and two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 
Pinch the ends and edges well as you fold over. Bake in moder- 
ate oven. Serve with butter and powdered sugar creamed to- 
gether, or with any plain sweet sauce or plain cream and sugar.

To make this day a success economically beef shortening 
must be appreciated and understood, as it is even better than 
butter for many recipes. 

Beef Shortening — Take all scraps of good beef fat left from 
roasts, steaks, corned beef or the liquor it is boiled in or fresh 
suet bought for the purpose. Cut up in pieces, first removing 
every trace of meat and scraping off burned and blackened places. 
Place in an old granite saucepan with one potato scrubbed and 
cut up, skin and all. Heat slowly till fat begins to melt so that 
it won't stick and burn. Stir or shake occasionally and squeeze 
with spoon till fat is all melted out of meat fiber. Strain at once 
into stone jar or old muffin tins. Should be clear and congeal to 
a good cream color. Will keep as long as butter in a cool place. 

Egg Toast — Six slices of bread half-inch thick, two eggs, half- 
cup milk, half teaspoon salt, one tablespoon butter and one of 
beef shortening. Beat together eggs, milk and salt in shallow 
dish. Dip in the slices of bread on each side, drawing off what 
does not soak in. Heat butter and shortening in frying pan, lay 
in the soaked bread and fry a good brown on both sides. Serve 
hot. 

Blueberry Cakes — One pint sifted flour, one pinch of salt, two 
even teaspoons baking powder, one-quarter cup butter, one-half 
cup sugar, one egg yolk and white beaten separately, one cup 
milk, one heaping cup huckleberries or blueberries. Sift to- 
gether flour, salt, and baking powder two or three times. Cream 
butter, add sugar and beat again. Add beaten yolk, then milk. 
Stir in the flour and beat thoroughly. Add white, beaten stiff, and 
lastly the berries picked over, washed and sprinkled with flour. 
Bake in muffin tins about half an hour. Sour milk may be used, 
with one-half teaspoon soda instead of the baking powder. 

Mutton Broth — Two pounds lean neck of mutton, cut up 
small bones and all. Cover with four quarts cold water and add 
one small onion sliced and bring to a boil. Wash and soak one- 
half cup rice and add to the broth as soon as it is fairly boiling. 
Keep all well covered and boiling steadily an hour and a half or 
two hours, until creamy and thick with the rice. Skim out meat 
and bones and set broth where it will cool so that any fat may 
be removed. Cut meat up fine, removing bones, and heat with 
the broth, adding one small tablespoon salt. If any is left over 
it makes an excellent addition to a tomato soup next day. 

Boston Brown Bread (sour milk) — Mix in the order given 
one exact half-cup white cornmeal, one-half cup rye flour, one- 
half cup graham flour, one-half teaspoon salt, one good half tea- 



332 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

spoon soda pulverized, and beaten into oae-quarter cup molasses; 
and one and a quarter cups of sour milk. Steam three hours. 11 
you have not the regulation brown breat tin, the oatmeal boiler, 
v/ell greased, makes a good steamer and a nice shaped loaf. 

Gingerbread — A piece of beef shortening size of an egg melted 
in one cup boiling water; add one cup molasses, then two cups 
flour, in which are sifted one teaspoon fine soda, one and a half 
teaspoons ginger and one-half teaspoon salt. Beat well; bake 
in a shallow tin in a quick oven. Should not be cut while hot, 
but may be lightly broken and eaten without fear of indigestion. 

Iced Cocoa — This should be made of all milk, and chilled 
without adding any cold milk. Beat thoroughly just before 
serving. 

Black Bean Soup — Soak over night one pint black beans. In 
the morning pour off the water and add two quarts fresh cold 
water. Set them on to boil slowly. Slice one small onion, fry in 
one tablespoon butter or beef shortening to a light brown and 
add to the beans. Simmer four or five hours or till beans are soft, 
adding a little cold water if they boil too hard. When soft rub 
the beans through a soup strainer, put the soup on to boil again 
and thicken with one tablespoon of flour cooked in one of butter 
(to prevent beans from settling). Now add, if you have it, a 
little water in which corned beef, a salt tongue or a ham have 
been boiled or the bone or a bit of the meat. This gives a better 
taste than any amount of salt and pepper seasoning. There 
should be two quarts of soup when finished. Pour over slices of 
hard-boiled egg and lemon, which should be served in each plate. 
Serve very hot with croutons. 

Brown Fricassee of Veal — Two pounds lean veal off the cheap 
part of the leg. Remove fat and bone and cut meat in two-inch 
"gobs." Put the bones on to simmer in cold water enough to cover. 
Salt, pepper and flour all over each "gob" of meat. Heat one 
tablespoon butter and one of beef shortening in frying-pan (or 
two tablespoons of either alone) and fry meat brown all over. 
Remove and if fat is all used up add as much more. Fry brown 
one small onion sliced and two tablespoons flour. Add the sim- 
mering water from the bones and stir till smooth, adding more 
water or a little sour milk to make sauce enough to cover the 
meat. Strain over the meat and stew slowly, closely covered tov 
two hours. This will make tender the tough parts of veal or beef 
and is a delicious dish. Add more salt and pepper if needed just 
before serving. 

French Beets — These are baked instead of being boiled and 
retain a much better flavor and juiciness. Select beets of even 
size, wash, and allow plenty of time to bake till tender, about 
three hours. Peel, slice and serve hot with dabs of butter, salt 
and pepper. 

Lettuce with Perfect Dressing — This is a pretty dish to finish 
at table while the meat course is being cleared away. Arrange 
the lettuce beforehand in a bowl with the leaves standing up so 
that the dressing can get down into them when poured over. For 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 333 

the dressing prepare a soup plate or small bowl by rubbing with 
onion. In this mix two saltspoons salt covered lightly with pep- 
per and a dash of cayenne. Melt with one tablespoon vinegar 
and add two or three tablespoons salad oil. Stir all together 
with a small lump of ice until it thickens and looks opaque. Re- 
move ice and pour dressing lightly over every bit of the lettuce. 

The gingerbread left from luncheon may be cut in small 
squares or diamonds and covered with powdered sugar, when it 
looks like new. Mrs. V. C. Sanborn.

BREAKFAST. 

Pears. 

Sliced Baked Ham. 

Light rolls. Coffee. 



LUNCHEON. 

Bread and butter. 

Tomatoes, with mayonnaise dressing. 

Tea cakes. Blackberries, with cream. 



DINNER. 

Green-pea soup. 

Fried chicken. 

Boiled green corn. Beets. 

Chocolate wafers. Peaches and cream. 



Baked Ham — Cover your ham with cold water and let it 
simmer gently, just long enough to loosen the skin, so that it 
can be pulled off (this will probably be in from two to three 
hours, according to the size of your ham). When skinned, put 
in a dripping pan in the oven, pour over it a teacup of vinegar 
and one of hot water, in which dissolve a teaspoonful of English 
mustard. Bake slowly, basting with the liquid every few minuses 
for two hours; then cover the ham all over to the depth of one 
inch with coarse brown sugar, press it down with your hand 
firmly, and do not baste again until the sugar has formed a thick 
crust, which it will soon do in a very slow" oven. Let it remain 
in a full hour after covering with sugar, till it becomes a rich 
golden brown. When done drain from the liquor in the pan and 
put on a dish to cool. When it is cool, but not cold, press, by 
turning a fiat dish on top. The pressing makes it cut firmly. 

Light Rolls — The bread must be made in a warm place. One 
quart milk, one teacup of yeast, one quart and a pint of flour. 
When this sponge is light, work in a well-beaten egg and two 



334 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

tablespoonfuls melted butter, with a teaspoonful of salt, half a 
teaspoonful of soda dissolved in hot water, one tablespoonful of 
white sugar and enough flour to make soft dough. Let this stand 
five hours. Shape with your hands into balls. Put them closely- 
together in the baking-pan; let them rise one hour. Bake half an 
hour. Do not let the rolls touch each other. The best sized pans 
for loaves are made of block-tin, eight and one-half inches long 
and four and one-half wide. The pan should be greased slightly 
either with lard or butter. 

Boiled Green Corn — Choose full grown but not hard corn. 
Test with your nail. When right, the milk should escape in a 
jet and not be thick. Put into boiling water and cook fast twenty 
minutes. 

Chocolate Wafers — This is a favorite recipe of the wife of 
Senator J. C. S. Blackburn, of Kentucky. One-half cup of butter, 
one tablespoonful of lard, one cup of sugar, one-half teaspoonful 
of salt, one-half teaspoonful of cinnamon, two ounces of grated 
chocolate, melted, one teaspoonful of baking powder, dissolve in 
two tablespoonfuls of milk, two and one-half cups of flour. Roll 
them, using as little flour as possible. Bake quickly.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 335 

The Granola, granose flakes and shredded wheat biscuit have 
directions for preparing on the outside of each package. The 
shredded cereal coffee also has directions on box. 

Codfish, in Cream — Cut salt fish into one-quarter inch dice, 
l)0ur boiling water over it and let stand for five minutes. Allow 
one cup of thin cream to one-quarter cup of fish; drain the fish, 
add to the boiling cream and serve on toast. A speck of cayenne 
is a great improvement. 

Whole-Wheat Bread Toast — Make the bread for toast in this 
way: One pint milk, two tablespoonfuls granulated sugar, one 
teaspoon salt, one-half ounce yeast. Set the yeast to rise mixed 
with one-half cup of tepid water and the sugar. Scald the milk, 
and when it is cool enough add the yeast, salt and flour; make 
as stiff a sponge as you can beat with a wooden spoon, probably 
about flve cups of flour. Let it rise to a little more than double 
its bulk. Then add as much more flour as you can work in by 
cutting with a knife. This bread does not require kneading, but 
should be handled lightly. Now put it into pans, kneading it a 
very little; let it rise once more, then bake more slowly than you 
do ordinary bread — about forty minutes; therefore do not let it 
get quite so light. From this bread (grown stale) make thin 
slices of toast, butter slightly and pour codfish in cream over. 

Shredded Cereal Coffee — Make according to directions on 
package and serve with hot milk. 

Chicken Custard — Scald together one cup of strong chicken 
stock and one cup of cream. Pour it over the well-beaten yolks 
cf three eggs and cook in a double boiler until slightly thickened. 
Add one-quarter teaspoon salt and serve cool in custard cups. 

Racahout des Arabes — One-half pound best French chocolate, 
one pound rice flour, one-fourth pound arrowroot, one-half pound 
loaf sugar sifted. These materials are to be thoroughly rubbed 
and mixed together. A dessertspoonful of this mixture should be 
slightly wet with milk or water, then stirred into one pint of boil- 
ing milk and boiled for flve minutes. This is excellent food for 
invalids or convalescents. Serve hot as a beverage. The amounts 
given in this recipe will make enough to last a long time. 

Broiled Steak — Turn your steak every ten seconds while 
broiling, as the juices rise to the top and run off and are lost if 
the steak is not turned very often. If steak one inch thick is 
broiled for eight minutes it will be very rare; if for twelve min- 
utes, it will be rare; if for fifteen minutes it will be well done. 

Celery with White Sauce — Scrape clean and cut the celery ^ 
into inch pieces. Cook in boiling salted water half an hour, or 
until tender. Drain and mix with white sauce. Celery is par- 
ticularly good for nervous or rheumatic people. 

White Sauce — One pint milk, two tablespoonfuls butter, two 
heaping tablespoonfuls flour, one-half teaspoonful salt, one-half 
saltspoonful pepper. Heat the milk over hot water. Put the but- 
ter in a granite saucepan and stir until it melts and bubbles. 
Add the drj'' flour and stir quickly until well mixed. Pour on 
one-third of the milk. Let it boil and stir well as it thickens. 



336 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Add another third of the milk. Let it boil up, and thicken and 
stir vigorously until perfectly smooth. Be sure all the lumps are 
rubbed out while in this thick state. Then add the remainder 
of the milk; let it boil, and, when smooth, add the salt and 

Denner 

Orange Sherbet— Two and a half cups water, one and a half 
cups sugar, juice of five oranges, juice of one lemon; boil the 
sugar and water together for about twenty-five minutes; when 
cool add fruit juice and freeze; serve in small glass cups. 

After-Dinner Coffee— Use the cereal coffee, using double the 
amount of coffee that you do for breakfast coffee.

Dr. Martin's breakfast food makes a delicious porridge; 
directions for making on package, and to be served with cream 
and sugar. 

Grape Marmalade— At this season there is so much fresh 
fruit on hand that the housekeeper will find herself with "left- 
overs." About the most satisfactory way of using up a small 
quantity of fruit is to make it into marmalade. Take the grapes 
which have dropped from the bunches and take the seeds out; 
then weigh or measure, and allow measure for measure of fruit 
and sugar. Place all together in a preserving kettle and boil 
slowly twenty-five minutes; then add the juice of one lemon to 
every quart or pound of fruit. Set away in marmalade or jelly 
glasses and serve very cold. Place in ice box the night before. 

Deviled Beef— Take slices of cold roast beef, rub with a little 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 337 

mustard if liked, lay them on broiler; broil over hot coals. 
Serve on a hot dish, with little lumps of butter on each slice. 
Sprinkle salt and pepper over all. 

Cantaloupe Melons — These should be cut in half and the 
seeds removed before sending to the table. A tablespoonful of 
strained honey in each half is very nice. 

Easy Sponge Cake — Three eggs beaten one minute, one and 
one-half cups sugar beaten with egg for five minutes; add one 
cup flour and beat one minute; one-half ciip of cold water, and 
another cup of flour in which has been mixed two teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder; beat all together one minute. Bake in a 
slow oven. 

Chicken Curry — Boil a chicken with great care, skimming 
constantly and keeping covered with water. When tender, take 
out the chicken and remove the bones. Put a large lump of but- 
ter into a spider, dredge the chicken meat well with flour, and 
lay in the hot spider; fry a nice light brown; keep hot and dry. 
Do not allow it to get hard. Take a pint of the chicken broth 
and stir into it two teaspoonfuls of curry powder, two of butter 
and three of flour, one of salt. Stir till quite smooth; then mix 
with the broth in pot; when well mixed, simmer five minutes; 
then add the browned chicken. Serve on large dish, garnished 
with rice. 

Baked Sweet Potatoes — Scrub well with a small brush kept 
for that purpose. Bake as you would Irish potatoes, only giving 
them longer time. When ready to serve, place on a hot potato 
cloth or napkin, crack open each one and place a piece of butter 
inside. 

Blackberry Charlotte — Make a boiled custard with one quart 
of milk, yolks of six eggs ind three-quarters of a cup of sugar; 
flavor to taste. Line a large ^lass dish with slices of sponge 
cake dipped in sweet cream, then a layer of blackberries well 
sweetened, then another layer of cake and berries as before. 
When the custard is cold, pour it over the whole; then beat the 
whites of the eggs to a stiff froth, add one-half cup of sugar, and 
flavor to taste; heap up on the top and decorate with large 
berries. Frances Pearson.

Cherries au Natural — Arrange a layer of fresh cherry leaves 
around the edge of a dainty china or glass dish. On this lay 
cherries (fresh gathered if possible), with stems on them. 

Cerealine Flakes — One measure of liquid to each measure 
of cerealine. Cook half an hour. Water alone can be used for 
cooking any of the cereals, but most of them are richer and finer 
flavored when the liquid used is milk and water, mixed in about 
equal proportions. The quantity of salt that should be used in 
cooking cereal is largely a matter of individual taste, as some 
people like considerable and others very little salt in their food. 
A safe general rule, however, to follow is to add half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt to each pint of liquid. 

Eggs in Surtout — Boil half a pound of bacon cut in thin slices 
and fry some bits of bread and butter; put three spoonfuls of 
cullis into the dish; garnish the rim with fried bread, break some 
eggs in the middle, cover them with rashers of bacon and do 
them over a slow fire. 

Ojalda — This is a most delicious form of bread to eat with 
coffee or chocolate. Take two cupfuls of flour, put it on the 
bread-board and make a hole in the middle of the pile; drop into 
it the yolk of an egg and a heaping tablespoonful of lard; wet 
this up with salted water until a stiff paste is formed; work this 
well, lifting it and throwing it down snappishly onto the board 
every few minutes until it is a light, smooth dough and full of 
blisters. Roll this very thin and cut in diamonds and fancy 
shapes with a pastry cutter, cutting two or three slits through 
the middle. Fry these a light brown in boiling lard and sift 
powdered sugar over them. They should be crispy and melting 
in one's mouth. Nice for luncheon or breakfast. 

Baked Haddock with Sauce — Use a haddock or cod weighing 
about three pounds and remove the flesh from the bones in as 
large strips as possible, then scrape off the small pieces. The 
head and skeleton of a fish are at least one-third of the whole 
weight. Take a solid three-quarters cup of crumbs, using the 
white part of a stale loaf. Butter a pudding dish and sprinkle 
with some of the crumbs. To the remainder of the crumbs add 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 339 

a very little thyme, a half-teaspoonful of salt, a bit of cayenne, 
an egg and a few drops of onion juice. Add plenty of milk to 
moisten it. Lay some of the fish in the bottom of the dish, sprin- 
kle with salt and pepper, then a layer of the crumbs, and last 
the rest of the fish, with a tablespoonful of butter cut in bits. 
This dish may stand awhile before cooking or be set at once into 
-the oven. When it is done, it should be turned out on to a plat- 
ter and be garnished if liked. It is an agreeable change from the 
usual way of baking a fish whole. 

The Sauce — For the sauce use the water in which the fish 
skeleton was simmered. Cook together a tablespoonful each 
of flour and butter and dilute with the fish stock or milk, if you 
haven't (as you should) taken the trouble to save the bones, and 
season. 

Creamed Carrots — Carrots are often overlooked as an appe- 
tizing and wholesome vegetable. Scrape, but do not peel, two 
good-sized ones, cut in lengthwise strips and then into cubes. 
Boil until tender and serve mixed with a white sauce made in 
the proportion of a tablespoonful each of butter and flour creamed 
together and cooked with a cup of milk. Season with an even 
saltspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper. 

Cabbage Salad — This salad requires about a pint and a half 
of chopped cabbage. The cabbage should have the loose leaves 
removed, the stem cut out, and then be laid in cold water twelve 
hours. Chop rather fine, pour over and mix with it a boiled 
dressing. Heat three-quarters of a cup of milk and beat two egg 
j'olks with a fork. Mix with the egg a half-teaspoonful of mus- 
tard, one-half teaspoonful of salt, a teaspoonful of granulated 
gelatine that has been softened in a little cold water, a teaspoon- 
ful of sugar and a few grains of cayenne. Cook a tablespoonful 
of butter and flour together and add half a cup of vinegar. Now 
cook the milk and egg mixture together like a soft custard and 
combine with the other part. This dressing, if sealed tight, will 
keep a long time. When the cabbage and dressing are mixed, 
fill little individual molds and set away to cool. After-dinner 
coffee cups, wet in cold water, make good molds. Bits of red beet 
or half olive put in the bottom of the mold before the cabbage 
is put in will make a pretty garnish when the salad is turned 
out. Nannie K. Van Keuren.

"To be a good cook means the knowledge of all fruits, herbs, 
balms and spices, and of all that is healing and sweet in groves 
and savory in meats. It means carefulness, inventiveness, 
watchfulness, willingness and readiness of appliances. It means 
the economy of your great-grandmothers and the science of mod- 
ern chemistry; it means much tasting and no wasting; it means 
English thoroughness, French art and American hospitality; it 
means, in fine, that you are to be perfectly and always ladies (loaf 
givers), and that you are to see that every to-day has something 
nice to eat. John Ruskin. 

Cantaloupe — Half them and place a piece of ice in each. 

Southern Pancakes — Beat four eggs and a half a pound of 
flour together until smooth; melt four ounces of butter and add 
with one ounce of sugar, a pinch of salt and a pint of milk. Put 
a spoonful at a time in a greased frying-pan, spread evenly over 
the surface, turn and serve hot. 

Hash Omelet — Stir finely chopped meat (you can use meat 
left from the day before or scraps of ham) with six well-beaten 
eggs and fry like an omelet. This makes a nice variation of an 
every-day dish. 

Lady Washington Rolls — It is a tradition in Virginia that 
these rolls were frequently served to the first President of the 
United States. Scant a pint of milk and let cool; add a table- 
spoonful of butter, a small teaspoonful of salt and sugar each; 
stir until well mixed, sift in two quarts of flour and beat for five 
minutes; add half a cupful of yeast, cover and set in a warm 
place over night. Knead, sift in flour to make soft dough, work 
well, put back in the bread-pan and keep warm for an hour; 
work down, make out in little rolls, put in a greased pan, stand 
in a very warm place for fifteen or twenty minutes and bake in 
a very hot oven. 

Jellied Tongue — This is a recipe prepared by Mrs. S. B. Buck- 
ner, and was often on her table when her husband was governor 
of Kentucky. Boil the tongue until tender, so that the skin will 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK.. 341 

pull off readily. Cut in thin slices and arrange in mold, having 
previously laid slices of lemon on bottom. Cover with jelly made 
of one box of gelatine dissolved in a cup of cold water. Add one 
quart of boiling water less a cup, juice of four lemons, two cups 
of sugar. Strain well. Let stand twelve hours before using. 

Watercresses with French Dressing — Wash the cresses care- 
fully and put ice on them. Three tablespoonfuls of oil, one of 
vinegar, one saltspoonful of salt, one-half a saltspoonful of pepper. 
Put the salt and pepper in a cup and add one tablespoonful of the 
oil. When thoroughly mixed add the remainder of the oil and 
the vinegar. If you like the flavor of onion, grate a little juice 
into the dressing. The juice is obtained by first peeling the onion 
and then grating with a coarse grater. 

Old Virginia Chess Cakes — This is a cake our grandmothers 
and grandfathers loved, but which is rarely seen now. A pint of 
flour mixed with a large spoonful of lard, a pinch of salt; make 
up with ice water. This crust is baked in small pans in a quick 
oven and then filled with the following: Three eggs beaten thick 
with sugar, quarter-teacup of butter, half-teacup of milk, turned 
with a teaspoonful of vinegar, and half a nutmeg. Put back in 
the oven until brown on top. 

Pineapple Preserve — To every pound of fruit put a pound of 
sugar. Peel the pineapple in the evening; chop in pieces the 
size of a small marble; cover with the sugar and let it stand over 
night. Put on the fire in the morning and let it cook until clear. 
Do not put any water in it. Add a little lemon juice to fiavor 
when done. 

Louisiana Gumbo File — Cut a chicken into small pieces; di- 
vide at every joint. Dip each piece into thin batter and fry a 
light brown. Chop potatoes, carrots and other vegetables (no 
cabbage) very small and fry in same grease. Put in suflacient 
water for soup and boil until all batter is dissolved and chicken 
thoroughly tender. About ten minutes before serving add a tea- 
spoonful of file (which you can buy at any large grocery); if 
not thick, add more. Let boil up once well and serve with rice 
cooked dry. 

Lettuce with Cooked Dressing — Yolks of three eggs, well 
beaten, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half saltspoon of cayenne 
pepper, one tablespoonful of oil or butter, one cup of cream, two- 
thirds of a cup of vinegar and the juice of two lemons. Stir oil, 
salt and mustard together; add well-beaten yolks. Beat well and 
add vinegar, lemon, foamy whites and cream. Put in a farina 
boiler and stir constantly until thick. 

Queen of Puddings — This is a favorite recipe of Mrs. John G. 
Carlisle. Dissolve one pint of stale bread crumbs in one quart of 
milk. Beat the yolks of four eggs with one cup of sugar and one- 
half cup of butter. Stir in the milk with the bread crumbs. Flavor 
with lemon juice and grated rind. Bake in a deep dish to a light 
brown or until ihe custard sets. Cover with the meringue made 
with the four beaten whites and four tablespoonfuls of sugar. Set 
in the oven for a few minutes. A dainty addition is to spread jelly 



342 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

or jam over the top of the pudding before covering with the 
meringue. 

Peaches Served Whole— Pick out the nicest and put on a 
dish with some green leaves and some ice. Send around pow- 
dered sugar with the fruit, as many people like to dip peaches in 
it after paring and quartering them. Mrs. S. M. Hardy. 

No. 701 West Chestnut Street, Louisville, Ky. 



SUNDAY, JULY THE TWENTY-FIFTH. 



BREAKFAST. 

Minced beef on toast. Apple sauce. 

Waffles. 

Home-made sirup. Coffee. 



LUNCHEON. 

Brown-bread sandwiches. 

Sliced cucumbers. Huckleberry cake. 

Iced buttermilk. 



DINNER. 

Calf's head and tomatoes. 

New potatoes. Creamed cabbage. 

Sea-moss blancmange. 

Sponge cake. Lemonade. 



Apple Sauce — There is apple sauce and apple sauce. To have 
it fresh and sprightly pare, quarter and slice thinly as rapidly 
as possible good, mellow apples— just now the Benoni answers 
that description — cover at once with boiling water and boil rap- 
idly until soft — no longer; sweeten lightly at this point with about 
two tablespoonfuls sugar to one pint of sauce. After six days of 
berries this is an agreeable change on the seventh. 

Brown-Bread Sandwiches — Cut the bread in thin slices and 
spread with the following mixture: One teacup of any remnants 
of fish, flesh or fowl, chopped very fine. If not already salted add 
half-teaspoonful salt and two or three dashes pepper. Should 
there be any salad dressing available use it to soften the meat, 
otherwise mix it with two tablespoons melted butter, one of 
cream, either sweet or sour, one-half teaspoon lemon juice, or one 
of good vinegar, and one teaspoon made mustard. Serve the but- 
termilk cold from the ice, not the ice in the milk. 

Calf's Head with the Skin On — Have the butcher saw the 
head in halves lengthwise through the skull. Take out the 
brains and soak in cold water for one hour. Remove the eyes and 
teeth. Wash the head well and soak in cold water one hour; then 
scald the nasal and throat passages. Wash again in cold water, 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 343 

put it over the fire in boiling water to nearly cover it, with one 
bay leaf, one onion, one stalk of celery or one-half teaspoon of 
celery seed, three whole cloves and one teaspoon salt. Simmer 
gently until tender — about three hours — skimming carefully at 
the first boil. Remove the fiber from the brains, put them in a 
saucepan, cover with boiling water, add one-half teaspoon salt, 
and simmer for fifteen minutes, take out, cut with a silver knife 
into small pieces and stand aside until wanted. When the head 
Is done take it from the water, remove the tongue, skin it and 
cut it in slices. Skin the head; cut the meat from it into nice 
pieces; put them with the tongue and brains in the center of a 
heated meat dish and keep warm while preparing sauce. Put one 
tablespoonful butter in a saucepan to brown; add to it two even 
tablespoons flour; mix smooth; then add one pint of the liquor 
in which the head was boiled; stir constantly until it boils, then 
add a tablespoonful mushroom catchup, one of Worcestershire 
sauce, one saltspoon of salt and two dashes of cayenne. Simmer 
the whole one minute. Place the fried tomatoes around the head, 
pour the sauce over the whole and serve, and you will think your- 
self well paid for the trouble. 

Fried Tomatoes — Cut six smooth, solid tomatoes into slices 
about one-eighth of an inch thick. Dry each slice carefully, then 
dust thoroughly with salt and pepper. Beat an egg in a saucer 
until light, add to it a tablespoon of boiling water. Dip each 
slice first in this, then in bread crumbs. Put two or three table- 
spoons of lard in a frying pan; when very hot cover the bottom 
with the slices of tomatoes, fry brown on one side, then turn 
and brown the other. Take up carefully with a cake turner. 

Creamed Cabbage — Chop fine as for cold slaw one small cab- 
bage, cover with perfectly boiling water, add soda size of a pea, 
boil ten or fifteen minutes, drain off the water. Draw the cab- 
bage to one side of the kettle, melt in the space one tablespoon 
butter, add one tablespoon flour, mix until smooth; then stir in a 
cup of milk and when it all boils add a small teaspoon salt. A 
most delicate way of preparing this vegetable. 

Sea-Moss Blancmange — The genuine sea moss must be pro- 
cured at a druggist's. Wash a handful of the moss in several 
waters to remove all the grit. Throw it in a quart of milk that 
has been brought to the boiling point. Put the whole in a double 
boiler and stir until enough of the sea moss has been absorbed 
by the milk to make it thick, which can be determined by trying 
a little in a cold dish. Add a pinch of salt and any flavoring that 
is liked. Strain into molds and serve very cold with sugar and 
cream. The exact time cannot be given for the cooking, as the 
gelatinous substance in the moss varies. Fifteen or twenty min- 
utes is usually enough. The sea moss gives a peculiarly dainty 
flavor and quality to the blancmange not obtained by any sub- 
stitute. 

Sponge Cake — Beat well the yolks of nine eggs; add four- 
teen ounces powdered sugar and beat until very, very light. Upon 
this beating depends the excellence of the cake. Add the juice 



344 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

and grated yellow of one lemon. Then stir in alternately, a little 
at a time, very carefully, the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs and 
five and one-half ounces of flour. Stir only enough to get it well 
mixed and bake at once in pan ten or twelve inches square, in a 
moderate oven, forty minutes. Sponge cake is toughened by bak- 
ing too rapidly. Mark off in squares with a knife and break 
instead of cutting. Mrs. Mary S. Peebles.

Barley — Steam for four hours the day before in a double 
boiler one cupful of pearl barley with one quart of water and 
three-quarters of a teaspoonful of salt. In the morning add one 
cupful of boiling water; stir thoroughly, reheat and serve. 

Peculiars — Two cups of flour, one teaspoonful baking pow- 
der, one-half teaspoonful salt, one egg, one pint sweet milk. 
Sift flour, baking powder and salt together, beat white and yolk 
of egg separately and add after thoroughly beating the sifted in- 
gredients with milk. Bake in gem pans in a quick oven. 

Calf's Head-Cheese — Clean a calf's head and boil in water 
enough to cover it until the meat leaves the bone; take with a 
skimmer into a wooden bowl; remove every particle of bone; 
chop small. Season with one level tablespoonful salt and one 
teaspoonful pepper. To the liquor that remains in the pot, which 
should be about one cupful, add one-half package gelatine dis- 
solved in one-half cup of boiling water. Mix all together. Pre- 
pare a round stone dish by rinsing in cold water without wiping. 
Slice a hard-boiled egg, lay in bottom of dish alternately with 
sprigs of parsley. Press meat in tightly, cover with cloth and

lay on a heavy weight. Set on ice. Must be made early in the 
morning. Turn out on platter, egg side up. Enough for two 
meals. This may be made from the calf's head left the previous 
day. 

Fig Cake — Three eggs, one cup of sugar, two-thirds cup of 
butter, three-quarters cup of milk, two and one-half cups of flour, 
two teaspoonfuls baking powder, one-eighth of a teaspoonful 
grated nutmeg, one teaspoonful vanilla. Work sugar and butter 
to a cream, add eggs beaten separately, then milk and flavoring. 
Beat in the two cups of flour thoroughly. Mix baking powder 
with remaining flour and add, beating slightly. Bake in four 
layers. Filling: One pound of figs, one and one-half cups granu- 
lated sugar, five tablespoonfuls of water, the white of one egg. 
Chop figs to a pulp. Boil sugar and water together until when 
taking a little out in a dish and beating it briskly it has the con- 
sistency of confectioners' sugar and water mixed. Remove from 
stove, add the fig pulp and white of egg beaten stiflly; place be- 
tween layers immediately. Enough for two meals. 

Cabbage and Milk Soup — One large white-heart cabbage, two 
quarts boiling water, three pints boiling milk, one-quarter of a 
pound of butter (two heaping tablespoonfuls), one teaspoonful of 
salt, one tablespoonful of flour, one-quarter teaspoonful pepper. 
Remove outside leaves of cabbage, cut in quarters, put into the 
boiling water, boil for one-half hour. Take one-half of the water 
— leaving cabbage to be used for hot slaw the next day — add the 
boiling milk, salt and pepper. Cook the flour and butter in a skil- 
let until smooth, add some of the soup and then stir all together. 
Let cook flve minutes and serve with croutons. 

Parmesan Cutlets — Two pounds of veal cutlets, one-half cup 
of dry bread crumbs, one-half cup of Parmesan cheese grated 
(any ordinary cheese may be used), one-half cup melted butter, 
one-half teaspoonful salt, one-quarter teaspoonful pepper, two 
beaten eggs. Dip cutlets in the melted butter, dust with the 
cheese and bread crumbs mixed; pour gently the beaten egg into 
which the salt and pepper has been mixed on both sides of cut- 
let, dust again with the bread and cheese crumbs and fry a deli- 
cate brown. 

Sauce — One-half pound macaroni, one heaping tablespoonful 
of butter, one cupful of strained tomato sauce, one tablespoonful 
grated cheese, one-half teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful of 
cornstarch. Cover macaroni with water and boil until it can be 
pierced with a straw. Boil one and one-half cups of tomatoes 
and rub through a sieve. Moisten cornstarch with two table- 
spoonfuls of tomato sauce and add to the main quantity. Stir 
in the salt, add the macaroni broken in inch lengths and the 
cheese crumbs. 

Blackberry Pudding — One egg, one cup sugar, one cup of 
sweet milk, one-half cup of butter, one-half cup of lard, two cups 
of sifted flour, one-quarter spoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder, one pint of blackberries. Beat sugar, butter and 
lard to a cream; add beaten egg, milk and flour sifted with salt

Celery salad. 

Peach leche cream. Coffee. 



Eggs au Lit — Mince two cupfuls of cold fowl or veal and ham 
in equal quantities, very fine, and rub in a Wedgewood mortar. 
Add by degrees one tablespoonful butter, one-half teaspoonful 
salt, half as much pepper, one tablespoonful parsley and two 
beaten eggs. Warm in a frying-pan when it is well mixed, stir- 
ring in a little warm water should it dry too fast. Cook five 
minutes, stirring to keep it from scorching. Form on a hot 
platter into a mound, with a ridge of the mixture running all 
around. Lay in the depression thus formed five poached eggs. 
Arrange triangles of buttered toast in such order at the base of 
the mound that they will form a pointed wall against it. 

Hominy Croquettes— To a cupful of small-grained salted 
boiled hominy add a tablespoonful melted butter and stir hard, 
moistening by degrees with a half teacupful of milk. Put in a 
teaspoonful of sugar and a well-beaten egg. Roll into oval balls 
with floured hands, dip in beaten egg, then cracker crumbs and 
fry in hot lard. 

Crumpets — Three cupfuls warm milk, half cup yeast, two table- 
spoonfuls melted butter, one saltspoonful salt and the same of 
soda. Flour to make a good batter. Set these ingredients as a 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 347 

sponge, leaving out the butter and soda. In the morning beat in 
the melted butter and the soda dissolved in a little water, and a 
half cupful sifted flour. Fill patty-pans or muffin-rings with the 
mixture. Let them stand fifteen minutes and bake. 

Ramakins — Beat together tv/o eggs, one tablespoonful melted 
butter, one teaspoonful anchovy sauce, one-half saltspoonful salt 
and half as much cayenne; then add three tablespoonfuls grated 
cheese and lastly one tablespoonful flour wet with cream. Spread 
thickly upon rounds of lightly toasted bread and brown lightly. 

Baked Apple Jelly — Fill a tv/o-quart granite or earthen dish 
with alternate layers of sliced tart apples and sugar. Bake three 
hours, closely covered. This is delicious, and should turn out a 
solid pink jelly. 

Peach Leche Cream — Twelve peaches pared and sliced, three 
eggs and the whites of two more, one-half cup powdered sugar, 
two tablespoonfuls cornstarch, wet in cold milk, one tablespoonful 
melted butter and one pint of milk. Scald the milk, stir in the 
cornstarch, and when it begins to thicken take from the fire and 
stir in the butter. When luke-warm whip in the beaten yolks till 
all are very light. Put the peaches into a dish, strew the sugar 
over them, then pour over the creamy compound. Bake in a 
quick oven ten minutes and spread with a meringue made of the 
five whites beaten stiff, with four tablespoonfuls of powdered 
sugar. Place in the oven till this is firm. Eat cold with cream.

348 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Fried Bluefish— Clean, wipe dry inside and out; sprinkle well 
with flour and season each with a good pinch of salt. Fry in hot 
butter or sweet lard. Have the fat deep enough in the skillet so 
the fish will not stick to the bottom while cooking. The mo- 
ment the fish are cooked a golden brown take them up and drain 
in a hot strainer. Garnish with parsley and serve in a well- 
heated dish. 

Cornmeal MuflBlns — Sift two coffee cups of cornmeal into a 
bowl and scald well with one cup of boiling water, beating the 
meal until perfectly smooth. Add one dessertspoonful of lard, 
one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of white sugar, one 
pint of cold milk and two well-beaten eggs. Mix and beat all into 
a smooth batter, putting in the eggs last. Then sift with two 
tablespoonfuls of wheat flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder 
and beat well into the batter. Have muffin pans greased and 
heated; half flll each compartment and bake in a good oven from 
thirty to thirty-flve minutes. 

Corn Beef Salad — Boil your beef the day before — select a lean 
piece — in enough cold water to cover it. Do not let it boil hard, 
but come gradually to the boiling point; then cook slowly until 
perfectly tender. Pull out the bones, place it in a dish, cover with 
a large plate, in which place an iron to press the meat, and so 
let it remain until the beef is cold. Cut one pound of it into half- 
inch pieces; what remains will make delicious hash for the fol- 
lowing day (baked hash). Remove most of the fat, if there is 
any. Then make the — 

Cream Dressing — Two eggs, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 
one of rich cream, one-quarter teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter 
teaspoon of mustard, a sprinkle of cayenne pepper. Beat eggs 
well, add the salt, mustard, then the vinegar and cream. Place 
the bowl with this mixture in a basin of boiling water on the 
stove and stir until about the thickness of rich cream. Cool, and 
when cold mix part with the chopped meat. Just before time 
to serve have a head of nice lettuce well washed and dried in a 
cloth. Place the larger leaves on a platter, mix the small ones 
with the meat, and over all pour the remainder of the salad 
dressing. 

Cherry Blanc-Mange — One quart sour Merilla cherries; wash 
in cold water and seed; place in the fire with half a teacup of cold 
water and stew until tender; add a teacupful of white sugar, a tea- 
spoon of butter and two tablespoons of cornstarch which have 
been perfectly dissolved in four tablespoons of cold water. Stir 
gently until cornstarch is cooked (from five to eight minutes), then 
pour into a dish or mold to cool. Eat with cream. 

Cream of Beet Soup — Four bunches of blood beets; pare, then 
grate and strain through a cloth. Put on the fire and let scald. 
Let one pint of milk come to a boil and add it to the hot juice; 
one saltspoon of salt; cream; two tablespoons of sifted flour 
with two of butter and stir them slowly into the soup and con- 
tinue stirring until the mixture is thick as a rich cream. Add a 
sprinkle of black or red pepper as preferred. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 349 

Broiled Lamb Chops — Put the chops in a double broiler and 
broil over or before the fire for eight or ten minutes. Serve in 
a hot dish with one-quarter teaspoonful of butter and a small 
pinch of salt for each chop after they are cooked. The fire for 
chops should not be as hot as for steak. Turn several times 
while cooking. 

Peas — Peas should be cooked in boiling, fresh water, enough 
to cover them well, and not be dished until perfectly tender. It 
is impossible to give an exact time for cooking, as the younger and 
more freshly gathered the more quickly they will cook; from forty 
minutes to an hour and a ba4f will be needed, according to size 
and freshness. When tender drain off all the water, add one-half 
teaspoonful of salt and a tablespoonful of melted butter to a 
pint of peas and serve in hot-covered dish. 

New Potatoes — Scrape and lay in cold water ten minutes; 
cover with boiling water and let boil fifteen minutes; then add 
the salt (to one quart of water half a tablespoonful of salt) and 
let boil hard fifteen minutes longer. When cooked pour off every 
drop of water; take off the cover of sauce-pan and shake the po- 
tatoes for a moment in a current of cold air; then place on back 
of stove and cover with a clean, coarse towel until ready to dish. 

Currant Paste — Get perfectly ripe red currants; stem, wash in 
cold water, drain and place in kettle on the back of the stove, 
mashing so as to start the juice. When the juice fiows freely let 
it come to a boil and strain through a fine sieve or cloth. To one 
pint of juice add one pound of white sugar and an inch of stick 
cinnamon, and when it again comes to a boil remove the cinna- 
mon and thicken with three full tablespoonfuls of rice flour which 
has been dissolved in three tablespoonfuls of cold water. Stir 
constantly until the flour is cooked (about ten minutes), then 
take off the stove and pour into a dish which has been rinsed 
with cold water. When cold put in the ice-box. Eat with cream. 
This is a Danish dessert. Mrs. Thomas Turtle.

DINNER. 

Broiled beefsteak. Scalloped potatoes. 

Stewed okra. Cucumber salad. 

Orange meringue pudding. 

After dinner coffee. 



Broiled Beefsteak — Select a steak of medium thickness, weigh- 
ing about two pounds. Wipe and broil quickly over coals; take 
up on hot platter, dot with small pieces of butter, season with 
salt and pepper and garnish with parsley. 

Junket — Warm one pint milk until tepid, add two tablespoon- 
fuls sugar and one teaspoonful vanilla. When dissolved stir in 
gently two teaspoonfuls rennet. Turn into the serving dish, 
let it stand ten minutes, then place carefully in a cold place. 
Serve very cold with or without sugar and cream. 

Junket is quite solid when ready for use, which will be in 
a couple of hours if left in a cold place. Rennet costs but little 
and makes a delicate dessert. 

Stewed Okra — Wash one pint young green okra, cut in pieces 
crosswise, place in a granite stewpan, cover with salted boiling 
water and let it simmer gently for half an hour. Add tw^o large 
tomatoes that have been peeled and chopped and stew ten min- 
utes longer. Add tablespoonful butter, one-fourth teaspoon pep- 
per and more salt if needed. This is a very nutritious dish.

them into halves lengthwise, taking out the seeds. Place them 
in cold water for an hour. When ready to serve peel three small 
tomatoes and chop coarsely. Chop also one pint watercress and 
mix with the tomatoes. Add a few drops onion juice, one-half 
to three-fourths teaspoon salt and a dash of cayenne pepper. 
Dry the cucumbers, fill them with the mixture and lay on let- 
tuce leaves. Squeeze over the filling the juice of one lemon and 
tablespoonful of olive oil and serve at once. 

Orange Meringue Pudding — One quart milk, one teaspoonful 
butter; three eggs, two tablespoonfuls cornstarch, one pinch of 
salt, one-half cupful of sugar and six oranges. Beat the yolks of 
the eggs light. Wet the cornstarch in a half cupful of the milk, 
place the remainder on the fire in a double boiler, and when it 
boils stir in the cornstarch. Cook ten minutes, add butter and 
salt. Take from the fire and stir in the yolks and sugar. Peel, 
seed and quarter the oranges, lay in a baking dish, add a sprink- 
ling of sugar and pour over the custard. Bake in a hot oven 
twenty minutes. Beat whites of eggs stiff, and add two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, spread over pudding, sprinkle a little sugar 
on top and brown quickly. Eat cold with whipped cream or 
a sauce made of sweetened and flavored milk.

tablespoonfuls of butter until yellow, add one cup of milk, one

Devonshire Cream— Stand a quart of good, fresh milk on 
the ice for twelve hours, or in winter for twenty-four hours, then 
set it on the stove till almost at the boiling point. It must not 
bubble, but should show wrinkles and look thick. The more 
slowly it is done the firmer it will be. Place it again on the 
ice. On the following day skim it by folding over and over in 
small rolls and set in the ice box till wanted.

two of sugar. Add a few small pieces of whole cinnamon and

butter and a few sprigs of parsley. Roll up and tie. Brown a

Corned Beef Hash (Delmonico's recipe) — Take equal quan- 
tities of minced corn beef, quite cold, and cold potatoes — baked 
potatoes not overdone preferred. Mix well; put into hot spider 
lightly greased. When thoroughly heated, add to each quart of 
the hash a half-cup of sweet milk, stir lightly; then put in the 
oven to bake for twenty minutes. It will then have a very light 
crust on both sides and be very toothsome. 

Graham Biscuits — One quart of graham flour, one teaspoonful 
salt, lard and butter size small egg, two heaping teaspoonfuls 
baking powder well stirred in the flour. Mix the dough with 
sweet milk, only stiff enough to roll out. The quicker it is mixed, 
cut and baked, the better the biscuits. 

Potato Salad With Cold Pish — This is an easy and agreeable 
way to use up remnants of Friday's dinner. Remove the skin 
from either the whitefish or trout or any other fresh fish; tear 
it into mouthful morsels. Cut the potatoes into dice; mince one 
small onion very fine, add cold boiled peas, string beans, cauli-

ful ground ginger and one teaspoonful ground cinnamon. When 
cooler, add two cups of flour twice sifted, and lastly one tea- 
spoonful of soda dissolved in tablespoonful hot water. Bake in 
loaf form in moderate oven. 

Giblet Soup — This soup is a great success and is very inexpen- 
sive, a plate of giblets only costing at market 5 cents. It is a 
very good imitation of mock turtle soup. The giblets of four 
chickens or two turkej^s are required, one medium onion, one 



356 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK:. 

carrot, half a turnip, a few sprigs of parsley, all of which come 
in the ordinary soup bunch. Heat butter size of egg in stewpan, 
throw in the sliced onion, later the minced carrot and turnip; 
when tender and a light brown, add the giblets, stirring in a 
tablespoonful of flour. Be careful to stir often that tUey do not 
burn. Now cut up giblets and put with vegetables into soup 
kettle with tablespoonful of salt, teaspooonful of pepper and three 
quarts of water, or stock in part, if you have it, or any chicken 
bones. Let this simmer slowly for three hours or more; then 
strain it. Take all the livers, mash into them a tablespoonful of 
melted butter, tablespoonful browned flour; squeeze the juice 
of small lemon into this and add to the soup. Place in tureen 
yolks of three hard-boiled eggs cut in half-dozen pieces, pour 
over the soup; serve. This recipe came from the New York Cook-^ 
ing school. 

Peach Dumplings — Make quite a rich biscuit dough; cut into 
small squares. Pare peaches and cut in half; extract the seed, 
put sugar in its place and cover with the other half. Put a peach 
on each square, with a little sugar on top. Pinch edges of dough 
carefully together; bake half an hour in moderate oven. Serve 
hot or cold with plain cream. Miss L. Torbert.

Sugared Blackberries — Fruit is more acceptable on a hot sum- 
mer morning than cereals, so let us begin our breakfast with the 
luscious, ripe berries, which have remained on ice until they 
are as cold as the north pole. Place a quart of these in a glass 
bowl, which you have polished until it sparkles like dewdrops 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 357 

kissed by the morning sun. Sprinkle with pulverized sugar each 
layer, using about one teacup. The top layer should be sugar. 
Serve in berry saucers, with cream, or not, as desired. 

Potato Finger Puffs — Pare four potatoes and boil until soft. 
Mash with a tablespoonful of butter and season with a half-tea- 
spoonful of salt and a quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper. When 
cold, add one egg and beat well. With floured hands mold into 
finger puffs and fry to a light brown in hot fat. Serve in a hot 
dish. 

Velvet Cakes — To one well-beaten egg, add one tablespoonful 
of melted butter, one-half pint of milk, one-half teaspoonful of 
salt, one-half pint of flour, .one teaspoonful of cream of tartar 
sifted with the flour, one-half teaspoonful of soda dissolved in one 
spoonful of hot water. Beat, and bake at once on a well-greased 
griddle. 

Tomato Omelet — Take five medium-sized tomatoes, chop fine- 
ly (after the skin is removed), and put into a saucepan with one 
finely chopped onion, one teaspoonful butter, one-half teaspoon- 
ful salt, one-quarter teaspoonful pepper and one cracker pounded 
finely; cover tight and let it simmer about an hour. Beat three 
eggs to a froth and stir into the tomatoes. Beat well together, 
and pour into a hot, well-greased griddle. Brown on one side, 
fold and brown on the other. Serve on a hot dish. 

Feather Cake — One cup of milk, one cup of sugar, one and one- 
half cups of flour, one egg, one tablespoonful butter, one tea- 
spoonful cream of tartar, one-half teaspoonful soda, one saltspoon- 
ful salt and one-half teaspoonful grated nutmeg. Bake in small 
tins. When cold, cover with a little icing and sprinkle with 
grated cocoanut. 

Summer Soup — In summer soup should be light and appetiz- 
ing, as few people desire rich food in any form at this season of 
the year. Many very excellent soups are made of vegetables, and 
the housekeeper can have her family partake daily of light, health- 
ful soups at a small cost, which will be more acceptable than the 
usual meat and fish soups. Peel and slice two potatoes, parboil 
them in enough hot water to cover them. While they are cook- 
ing, chop two tomatoes, slice the corn off two ears of corn, and 
add one slice of onion, which you have saved from breakfast. 
Drain the potatoes, and put all on to cook in two quarts of cold 
water. When done, rub all through a colander, return the soup 
to the pot, add a level tablespoonful butter, one teaspoonful salt, 
one-half a one of pepper and one of minced parsley. If not thick 
enough, moisten a teaspoonful flour with cold water, thin with 
the soup and stir in; let boil up once, and it is ready for the table. 

Beef Pie v/ith Potato Crust — If you have been extravagant 
the day before and have some of your nice roast left over, and 
wish to economize to-day, you can take the scraps of this, or any 
cold meat that would not look inviting served as it is, and make 
a very wholesome and nutritious dish by the following recipe: 
Boil five large potatoes in salted v/ater; when done, slice a layer 



358 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

of them into a baking dish; then place a layer of meat, a sprinkle 
of salt and pepper, also celery salt; then potatoes and meat, and 
so on until your dish is full. It will take a teaspoonful of salt, 
a half one of pepper and a saltspoonful of celery salt. Mash the 
remainder of your potatoes, which should make about a cupful; 
add one tablespoonful of butter. When cool, add one well-beaten 
egg, one cup of milk, one-half teaspoonful salt, and beat all to- 
gether until very light; then work in enough flour, to which you 
have added one-half teaspoonful baking powder, to enable you to 
roll out in a sheet. When you have poured over your meat and 
potatoes a gravy which you have made from the scraps of fat 
and bones, place this paste over all, cut a cross slit in the middle 
and bake. A slice or two of onion improves this pie to those who 
like the flavor. Lucy Withrow.

ice served in each saucer of berries is very refreshing. Pound ice 
in a flannel bag with a wooden mallet. 

Bread Sponge Muffins — Set sponge as for water bread late the 
evening before. Allow one pint of warm water for one dozeil 
muffins, to be baked in gem pans, and use one-third cake of com- 
pressed yeast and a pinch of salt. Mix sponge a little thicker 
than for pancakes and beat thoroughly. In the morning dip, 
without stirring, into greased gem pans and let rise not less than 
half an hour. Bake brown in hot oven. 

If any muffins are left they are much like English muffins 
if cut in halves and toasted. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 359 

By setting sponge for the regular baking at night, and mixing 
bread before brealcfast, the muflBlns, white and graham bread, can 
all be baked with the heat of the morning fire. 

Fried Tomatoes — Wash six large, firm tomatoes, and cut 
across in halves without removing skin; sprinkle with flour. Put 
one teaspoon lard and one of butter in frying pan. When hot 
place tomatoes in it with cut side down. This prevents juice run- 
ning out. Cover for ten minutes. Remove cover, sprinkle with 
one small teaspoonful of salt, a half-saltspoonful of pepper, and 
fry twenty minutes until both sides are brown, being careful not 
to burn. Place on platter and cover with a gravy made with one- 
half pint of milk poured in the frying pan and thickened with a 
tablespoonful of flour made smooth in a little milk and seasoned 
with a pinch each of salt and pepper. 

Green Apple Governor — Peel and core apples and slice thin. 
Fill a piepan heaping full of apples without seasoning or crust. 
Cover with pastry made with kitchen spoonful of shortening, half 
lard and half butter, cut through two heaping kitchen spoons of 
flour and mixed lightly together. Use enough iced water to make 
a dough and roll thin. Bake until apples are tender, lifting crust 
in order to be sure. When done remove crust and place it top 
side down on a plate. Let stand until crust and apples are cold. 
Just before serving add to the apples one teacup of white sugar 
and stir and mash until smooth. Spread on crust and grate nut- 
meg over the top. Serve with or without whipped cream.

break the bones, add two quarts of cold water, and simmer slowly 
five hours. Strain through a fine sieve, removing every particle 
of fat. Season only with salt, about a teaspoonful, and one-half 
saltspoonful pepper. Sufficient for two days. 

Blackberry Bread — Stew blackberries or any other small fruit 
and sweeten to taste (about one-half cup of sugar to one quart of

then in crumbs and fry in hot fat. 

Ginger Cake — One cupful of sugar, one-half cupful of butter, 
two eggs. Dissolve one-half teaspoonful of soda in one-half cup- 
ful of milk. Add about two cupfuls of fiour, in which sift a tea- 
spoonful of cream tartar. Add also a tablespoonful of ginger. 
Bake slowly about three-quarters of an hour in a square baking 
tin, and when cool make two layers and spread whipped cream 
between and on top. A little grated cocoanut dusted over is an 
improvement. 

Baked Trout a la Chambord — Split the fish in halves, remove 
the bone and lay the fish in a buttered pan, skin next to pan; 
cover the top with salt and pepper, a slight sprinkling of cracker 
crumbs and put in oven to bake. The bones and head of the fish 
should be chopped fine and put in saucepan with half a cup of 
butter, a small onion (cut up), and allowed to cook for fifteen 
minutes; pour over it a pint of stock, let it boil ten minutes 
and strain; add a can of mushrooms chopped fine, thicken with 
a few cracker crumbs, season with salt and pepper and Anchovy 
paste; the trout will almost be done by this time; take it out of 
the oven, pour off all fat and cover the fish with the prepared 
sauce; bake to a finish and serve. 

Potato Viennoise — Boil eight peeled potatoes; when done, 
drain and press through a potato press; mix one even teaspoonful 
of salt, one-half even teaspoonful of pepper, two ounces of butter, 
the yolks of three eggs, one-half gill of cream, and four ounces 
of grated Parmesan cheese. Mix well and form the mixture into 
round balls the size of an egg. Sprinkle some flour on a pastry 
board, roll the potatoes into long shapes, thick in the center and

pointed at the ends; brush them over v/ith beaten eggs; make 
two slanting incisions on top of each, lay them in a buttered pan, 
brush over again with egg and bake to a fine golden color in a hot 
oven. 

Sponge Custard — One pint of milk, yolks of two eggs, white 
of one, if large, one-half ounce of gelatine soaked in cold water, 
two tablespoonfuls of white sifted flour; flavor with two teaspoon- 
fuls of vanilla. Heat the milk and stir into the well-beaten yolks 
and sugar, return it to the saucepan and stir till it thickens. Melc 
the gelatine by adding a tablespoonful of boiling water and setting 
it in a vessel of hot water; when melted, add it to the milk; 
when well mixed, set by to cool. As soon as it commences to 
congeal whisk it thoroughly with an egg-beater, and add to it 
gradually the white of an egg, previously whipped to a stiff froth. 
Beat it rapidly and until quite spongy, and fill a mold. Let it 
cool five or six hours at least. Dip the mold in hot water when 
ready for use. The above quantities will fill a quart mold. It 
can be made the day before, if convenient.

SATURDAY, • AUGUST THE SEVENTH. 



BREAKFAST. 

Cantaloupe on ice. 

Boiled eggs. Graham gems. 

Coffee. 



LUNCHEON.

Lemonade. 



DINNER.

Boiled Eggs — Eggs, even at this time, are very wholesome for 
the morning meal, if fresh. Test the eggs to see if they are fresh 
by dropping them into a pan of cold water; those sinking first 
are the freshest. Take ten of the fresh ones, put them into a tin 
pail and pour over them two quarts boiling water, cover and set 
away where they will keep hot and not boil for ten or twelve 
minutes. The heat of the water cooks the eggs slowly and evenly 
through, like any other food, and they are much nicer than when 
boiled in the ordinary way, and should be eaten from the shell. 



364 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Cheese Sandwiclies — Take three hard-boiled eggs, three- 
quarters pound common fresh cheese grated, one saltspoonful 
salt, one teaspoonful pepper, one teaspoonful prepared mustard, 
three tablespoonfuls melted butter, three tablespoonfuls vinegar 
or cold water. Put yolks of eggs into a small bowl and mash; 
add to it butter and mix smoothly with a spoon; add salt, pep- 
per, mustard and cheese, mixing each well. Lastly put in the 
vinegar (or water, if vinegar is not liked), which will make it of 
the proper consistency. This is easily made and very nice. 

"Never Fail" Sponge Cake — A good sponge cake should be 
yellow as gold, of velvety softness and tender as a marshmallow. 
if the rule given is strictly followed such a cake will be the 
sure result. Separate the whites and yolks of four eggs. Beat 
the whites until stiff enough to remain in bowl if it is inverted, 
then beat into them- with the beater half a cup of sugar, which 
must be granulated (powdered sugar makes tough cake and 
proper beating does away entirely with the grains). Beat the 
yolks, add to them a half cup of sugar, beating for five minutes 
by the clock — this latter being important, as the delicate texture 
of the cake depends upon it. Add to the yolks the juice and 
grated rind of a lemon. Now beat well together the yolks and 
whites. At this stage beating is in order, but must be absolutely 
avoided after adding the flour, of which take one cup. The 
mixture should now look like a puff ball, and the flour is to be 
tossed or stirred into it with a light turn of the wooden spoon. 
Stirring is quite different from beating. The cup of sugar must 
be generous, the flour scanty. Bake for twenty-five minutes in a 
moderate oven. Just before putting in the oven sprinkle on top 
through a sifter about a tablespoonful of granulated sugar; this 
gives the "crackly" top crust so desirable. 

Ladies' Cabbage — Boil a firm white cabbage fifteen minutes, 
changing the water then for more from the boiling teakettle. 
When tender drain and set aside until perfectly cold. Chop fine 
and add two beaten eggs, a tablespoonful of butter, some pepper 
and salt, three tablespoonfuls of rich milk or cream. Stir all 
well together and bake in a buttered pudding dish until brown. 
Serve very hot. This is very much like cauliflower and is very 
digestible and palatable. 

Deed Suet Pudding — Two cups flour, sifted, with one heaping 
teaspoonful baking powder, one cup of beef suet, free from 
strings and chopped fine, half teaspoonful of salt, rub all to- 
gether thoroughly between the hands, then mix with fork into 
a rather soft dough, with about a cup of very cold water. Do 
not handle much, but roll out once very quickly until half an 
inch thick. Have ready prepared a two-quart bowl with a raised 
rim, line this with the dough, bottom and sides; heap with any 
fruit liked; add one-half cup of sugar, two or three tablespoonfuls 
of water, cover with dough and tie tightly over it a good-sized 
canton fiannel cloth, rough side out, wrung very dry out of cold 
water and floured. Put into a large pot of boiling water, with 
a mufiin ring or pot lid on the bottom, and keep boiling for two 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 365 

hours. As the water boils away it is of great importance to 
renew only with boiling water; the teakettle should be kept 
full for the purpose. Eat with cream and sugar or hard or soft 
sauce, as liked. This will be a new pudding in most households, 
but in reality is a very old one and a great favorite with those 
who once have tasted it. Guests always ask for the recipe. It 
is nice made with pieplant, but plums and peaches are delicious.

Green Corn Omelet — Take four good-sized ears of very tender 
sweet corn, score lengthwise of the kernels and press out the 
pulp with the back of the knife. Mix with five well-beaten eggs, 
add four tablespoonfuls of rich milk, three-quarters of a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and tvv^o or three dashes of pepper. Have the frying 
pan very hot, put in a good teaspoonful of butter; when well 
melted, pour in the omelet. Cook with care, folding over as soon 
as it sets, and dish on a hot platter. Left-over corn may also be 
used. 

Browned Potatoes — Take potatoes which have been boiled 
whole the day before, quarter them lengthwise — if very large, 
split the quarters — and brown them evenly in a hot skillet, with 
a tablespoonful of butter or good meat drippings. 

Creamed Beef — Have half a pound of nice dried beef thinly 
shaved; put in a saucepan or skillet with enough cold water to 
cover it. If the beef seems too salty, pour off this water when it 
begins to boil. Put a cupful of fresh hot water on the meat and 
simmer for ten minutes, keeping covered. Then put in a teacup 
of good sweet milk and a small tablespoonful of butter. Beat an 



366 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

egg light and stir into it a heaping tablespoonful of flour. Ruh 
smooth and stir into the beef; let it simmer for about two min- 
utes, stirring well all the time. 

Warm Gingerbread — Two coffeecups of flour, one cup of New 
Orleans molasses, one-half cup butter, one cup warm water, one 
egg, one dessertspoonful ginger (or more if liked), one teaspoon- 
ful soda, half-teaspoonful salt. Put the flour in deep earthen 
dish or bowl, mix the ginger and salt v/ith it thoroughly; then 
put in the other ingredients, dissolving the soda in the warm 
water, but do not stir until all are in the dish. Then stir lightly 
until well mixed; beat for three minutes and turn into square 
pan well buttered. Bake in moderately hot oven until broom 
straw comes out dry. Use same cup for all measurements. This 
is very easy to prepare, and is equally good warm or cold. 

Tomato Bisque — Prepare enough ripe tomatoes to make a 
quart when peeled and sliced, one small onion cut very fine; 
put in a granite kettle with a pint of hot water; stew slowly for 
half an hour and rub through a sieve. Return to kettle and 
stir in a half-teaspoonful of soda, let it foam up well, and add 
teaspoonful of salt and tablespoonful of sugar. At the time the 
tomatoes are stewing prepare in a double boiler a pint of rich 
milk and a tablespoonful of butter; moisten a tablespoonful of 
flour or cornstarch in a little cold milk and stir into the hot 
milk just as it comes to a boil. Cook for a few minutes until 
well thickened, and turn into the tomatoes with half a cupful of 
rolled crackers.. Serve at once. 

Baked Macaroni — Break into half-inch pieces enough maca- 
roni to fill a large cup. Put it into a large kettle of boiling salted 
water and cook rapidly for twenty minutes or until tender 
enough to cut easily with a fork. Turn it into a colander and 
let cold water run through to rinse it. Put it into a shallow 
baking dish and cover with white sauce, made by cooking one 
tablespoonful of flour in one tablespoonful of melted butter in 
small saucepan; when the flour is rubbed smooth in the butter, 
stir in gradually one cup of hot milk. Season with half a tea- 
spoonful of salt and a quarter-spoon of pepper. Spread this 
sauce evenly over the macaroni and cover with a cup of finely 
rolled crackers moistened with melted butter. Bake until the 
crumbs are brown. This is a delicious side dish at dinner.

Huckleberries with Crackers and Cream — Pick over carefully 
one quart of blueberries and keep them on ice until wanted. 
Put into each bowl, for each person, two soda crackers broken in 
not too small pieces. Add a few tablespoonfuls of berries, a tea- 
spoonful of powdered sugar, and fill the bowl with cold sweet 
cream. 

Halibut and Eggs on Toast — Put into boiling salted water 
one pound of fresh halibut, cook slowly fifteen minutes; remove 
from the water and chop fine, then add one-quarter of a cupful 
of melted butter and six eggs well beaten, half a teaspoonful or 
salt and one-quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper. Place over the 
fire a thick-bottomed frying-pan containing a tablespoonful of 
cold butter; when it begins to melt, tip the pan so as to grease 
the sides; then put in the fish and eggs, stirring one way until 
the eggs are cooked. Turn over toast dipped in hot salted water. 

Green-Corn Cakes — Take cooked corn left over from a pre- 
vious meal and cut it from the cob. Put a cupful of milk to every 
cupful of corn, half a cupful of flour, one egg, a pinch of salt; 
mix well into a thick batter and fry in very hot lard. Serve with 
butter and powdered sugar. 

Cheese Souffle — Melt an ounce of butter in a sauce-pan, mix 
smoothly with it an ounce of flour, a pinch of salt and cayenne 
and a quarter of a pint of milk; simmer the mixture gently over 
the fire and stir it all the time till it is as thick as melted butter; 
stir into it about three ounces of cheese finely grated. Turn it 
into a basin and mix with it the yolks of two well-beaten eggs. 
Then whisk three whites to a solid froth, and just before the souf- 
fle is baked stir them gently and thoroughly into it and pour the 
mixture into a small round tin. It should only be half filled, as 
the mixture will rise very high. Pin a napkin around the dish 
in which it is baked and serve the moment it is done. It will 
cook in twenty minutes. 

Berry Tea Cakes — One cupful of sugar, two eggs, a pinch 
of salt, one and a half cupfuls of milk, one heaping teaspoonful of 
baking powder, a piece of butter the size of an egg and flour suf- 
ficient to make a stiff batter (about three cupfuls). In this bat- 
ter stir a pint bowl of berries (any kind). Bake in muflin rings. 
Serve while warm. To be eaten with butter. 



363 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Broiled Mutton Chops and Tomato Sauce — Cut the choi3s from 
a tenderloin of mutton, remove a portion of the fat and trim them 
into a nice shape; slightly beat and level them; place the gridiron 
over a bright, clear fire; rub the bars with a little fat and lay on 
the chops. While broiling frequently turn them, and in about 
eight minutes they will be done. Sprinkle each with a dash 
of pepper and a pinch of salt. Dish them on a very hot dish, 
rub a small piece of butter on each chop, pour a tomato sauce over 
them and serve quickly. 

Stuffed Eggplant — Cut the eggplant in two, scrape out all the 
inside and put it in a sauce-pan with two tablespoonfuls of minced 
ham; cover with water and boil until soft; drain off the water; 
add two tablespoonfuls of grated crumbs, a tablespoonful of but- 
ter, half a minced onion, one-half of a teaspoonful of salt and a 
dash of pepper. Stuff each half of the hull with the mixture; add 
a small lump of butter to each and bake fifteen minutes. Minced 
veal or chicken can be used in the place of ham, in which case 
more salt must be added. 

Peach Meringue — Pare and quarter (removing stones) one 
quart of ripe peaches, place them all in a dish, sprinkle with a 
cupful of sugar and cover them well with the meringued whites 
of three eggs. Stand the dish in the oven until the eggs have 
become a delicate brown, then remove, and when cool set the 
dish on ice. Take the yolks of the eggs, add to them a pint of 
milk sweetened with one tablespoonful of sugar and flavor with 
a dash of cinnamon. Boil in a custard kettle, being careful to 
keep the eggs from curdling. When cool pour into a glass pitcher 
and serve with the meringue when ready to use.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 369 

Omelet with Peas — Break six eggs into a basin, beat thorough- 
ly, adding a pinch of salt, dash of v/hite pepper, and two table- 
spoons of cream. Have spider hot and well greased; pour in and 
shake almost continually. If one has two tablespoons of cooked 
peas or asparagus tops or string beans they may be heated and 
added now, scatter on top lightly and roll up in the omelet. 

Hot Corn Bread — Scald two cups of cornmeal with one pint 
boiling sweet milk; add two tablespoons sugar or molasses, a 
pinch of salt; let it cool slightly, then stir in yolks of two eggs 
well beaten, also full tablespoon melted lard or butter. Lastly 
add the two whites, well frothed, stirring in lightly. Grease and 
heat pans; have oven hot. If in one pan bake one-half hour, if in 
gem pans twenty minutes. 

Meat Rissoles — Make rich biscuit dough, roll out into little 
squares, put upon each of these a good spoonful of calves' liver, 
which has been boiled, seasoned and finely minced into a paste, 
with a trifle of onion and butter added. Cold chicken meat or 
veal is also nice if liver is not liked, but be sure whatever is used 
is well minced and seasoned; add the butter as you put upon the 
square. Now fold over the edges and pinch carefully together. 
Bake in rather hot oven; serve hot. 

Creamed Apple Sauce — One quart cold apple (green) sauce, 
one light cup powdered sugar, one cup rich milk (cream if pos- 
sible), whites of two eggs, well frothed. Mix sugar and cream 
until well dissolved, then add whites of eggs and pour over the 
cold apple sauce. This dish will only require six minutes if ap- 
ple sauce is ready. 

Baked Vegetable Soup — Convenient to make on baking day, 
as it can occupy the back of oven and be taken out for a time if 
space is needed and returned without detriment. Put into jar or 
deep pan that can be tightly covered about two pounds lean beef 
or mutton, cut into many slices; one tablespoon salt, one teaspoon 
pepper, four onions, two parsnips, four carrots, two turnips, six 
potatoes, six tomatoes — the latter previously scalded and skinned, 
the others pared or scraped and cut into pieces size of a pigeon's 
egg. Add to this three quarts cold water when put in oven. Never 
use cooked meat for this soup and keep tightly covered always. 
Two hours will make this nicely. If water falls much below three 
quarts add boiling water upon opening to serve. 

Rolled Beefsteak, with Brov/ned Potatoes — Two pounds round 
steak, remove the bone. Make dressing of two cups of bread 
crumbs (dry), one-quarter pound salt pork, chopped very fine, 
dash of pepper; omit salt, but add seasoning of sage, parsley or 
onion, as preferred. Spread this over the steak, then roll up care- 
fully, tying at least three places to keep carefully in roll form. Put 
in dripping pan, with half a pint hot water, and a tablespoon lard; 
bake in moderate oven, basting often. Brown the potatoes in 
same pan. Make gravy of drippings and pour over meat and po- 
tatoes served on same platter. Cut meat from end.

Cucumber Pickles — Take as many small, crisp cucumbers as 
will fill a half-gallon glass jar; cover with a brine made of one 
quart of water to one-half cup of salt, and let stand over night. 
Remove from brine. Pack as closely as possible in jar. Bring to 
a boil one cup of strong vinegar and one-third cup of water, one- 
half cup of sugar, two sticks of cinnamon and a dozen whole 
cloves tied in a thin cloth; fill jar and close air tight. They will 
keep for any length of time or will be ready for use in two days. 

Fried Chicken — Joint a young chicken, wipe dry with a clean 
cloth and roll in flour. Put one tablespoonful each of butter and 
lard in roasting pan and have boiling hot. Put chicken in and 
sprinkle with one teaspoonful salt, a half teaspoonful pepper and 
fry brown quickly on one side; then turn on the other side, cover 
closely, and immediately set in the oven and bake one-half hour. 
Take the chicken out on a hot platter, stir a teaspoonful of flour 
in a cupful of milk; pour in the pan, add a pinch of salt and dash 
of pepper; when it boils up once pour over the chicken. This is a 
much nicer way than where it is cooked entirely on the top of the 
stove. 

Banana Shortcake — Make a nice baking-powder biscuit dough, 
using a quart of flour. Roll out in two sheets three-fourths of an 
inch in thickness. Spread one with a tablespoonful of butter, put 
the other on top and bake twenty minutes in a hot oven. Have 
ready eight bananas sliced thinly; remove top layer, spread ba- 
nanas on lower layer, strew with one-half cup sugar, replace top 
layer and serve with either sugar and cream or a tablespoonful of 
whipped cream over each slice. Nellie E. Knee.

of flour sifted with one saltspoonful of salt, and a level teaspoon- 
ful of baking powder. Bake in a buttered cake pan forty-five min- 
utes. When ready to use, break into pieces. Sponge cake should 
never be cut. 

Corn Soup a la Royale— Take the water chicken was cooked in 
and place on the fire; add the remaining chicken meat and bones 
to the stock, of which there should be two quarts. Simmer until 
the meat leaves the bones, then strain; flavor with a teaspoonful 
of salt, a pinch of cayenne, and celery salt. Add a small cupful

ness. Then pour in a half of a cup of sweet cream, cover closely 
and boil for a while. Take care not to fry the meat too long. 

Fruits Macedoine — Every kind of fruit, such as raspberries, 
gooseberries, currants and musk melons, the latter cut in pieces, 
pour over with sugar, then put it into an ice box for two hours; 
when you will serve pour over with fruit juice. 

Curly Cakes — Two tablespoonfuls of melted butter, one cup 
of water and a teaspoonful of sugar; boil this, and while boiling 
on a small fire and stirring constantly, pour in one cup of flour, 
stir until it no more adheres to the pot. Then put in an egg, 
mix thoroughly and when cool three eggs more. Mix well and 
over a large greased tin pan spread the dough, making it as thin 
as paper; cut this directly in square pieces, pour over sugar with 
fine chopped almonds and put into a moderate oven. When 
baked the color ought to be golden-brown. 

Russian Chlodnik^ — Boil pie plants in water without sugar, 
take one quart of this liquor without the pie plants. While yet 
hot put in some chopped dill, four dark red beets cooked and 
peeled, two sour cucumbers cut into squares, three hard-boiled 
eggs cut in slices, cooked crabs peeled from their shells. Then 
beat a pint of good, thick, sour cream, prepare with the ob- 
tained liquor and put into the ice box. Must be served very cold. 
This soup is excellent. 

Beef Tongue — Boil an unsmoked beef tongue; when tender 
peel off the skin, cut in slices, pour over the sauce, cover closely 
and boil for twenty minutes. 

Sauce Lyonnaise — Brown one tablespoonful of butter and the 
same quantity of flour, add some liquor from the boiling tongue. 
Brown separately a little of sugar, put into sauce, allow it to 
boil; put also a handful of stoneless raisins and four almonds 
cut finely; vinegar or lemon juice and salt according to one's 
taste. 

Vegetables au Gratin— Boil separately in salted water a head 
of Savoy cabbage, cut into pieces, green peas, asparagus, cut into 
pieces, and the like. When soft drain, strew over it a little bit 
of sugar. Lay some butter into a tin pan, then cabbage, then 
grated Parmezan cheese; again butter, peas, cheese, and again 
until all is used. Cover closely and put for an hour into a mod- 
erate oven. Serve with brovv'ned butter and bread crumbs.

French Cherry Pie — Two yolks, two tablespoonfuls of fresh 
butter, one tablespoon of sugar and one tablespoonful of milk 
and enough flour to make a dough. Knead well and spread on 
a greased pie tin, and bake in moderate oven until it gets a gold- 
en-brown color. The day before preparation take out the stones 
of a quart of red or dark cherries, mix richly with sugar and al- 
io v/ to remain over night. Next morning strain (reserve the juice 
for our fruits macedoine), take a cupful of thick sour cream, mix 
with the cherries, pour over -the pie when the latter is already 
cool and put into the ice box. This is delicious.

Scalloped Salmon — Make a cream sauce as follows: Melt, 
without browning, two tablespoonfuls of butter and add two 
tablespoonfuls of flour; stir in a pint of milk, and when it thick- 
ens season with a half-teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pep- 
per. Take from the flre until ready to use. Take a pint of salmon 
or any cold seasoned fish left from the day before. Put a layer 
of flsh in the bottom of a baking dish, then a layer of sauce and 
a layer of bread crumbs, and so on until the fish is used. Brown 
in a quick oven. 

Maryland Fried Chicken — The chickens should always be 
dressed and kept in the ice box for at least twelve hours before 
using. Flour each piece and dust lightly with salt, and pepper. 
The frying pan should be half full of lard, and the latter smoking 
hot, when the chicken Is put in. Then cover and let cook slowly 



376 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

for half an hour, turning from time to time. When done pour 
the fat from the pan and add a tablespoonful of butter and let 
brown; then stir in a tablespoonful of flour, pour in a cup of 
milk and let thicken. Serve the gravy in a separate dish. Put 
little strips of fried mush around the chicken. There could be 
no more palatable way of cooking chicken. 

Cucumbers — Cut four cucumbers in two lengthwise and 
scoop out all you can without breaking the little boats thus 
formed. Throw these into cold water until needed. Chop the 
cucumber which has been taken out with two medium-sized 
onions. Let this drain in a colander for fifteen minutes. Then 
season with two tablespoonfuls of celery seed, one tablespoonful 
mustard seed, one teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter teaspoonful of 
pepper and two dashes of cayenne pepper. Fill the little boats 
and serve. This mixture will keep in a glass jar, sealed, for sev- 
eral weeks. 

Frozen Souffle — Take three tablespoonfuls of granulated 
sugar and six raw egg yolks; whip slowly, warming over hot 
water while beating. When an almost solid froth, remove and 
cool the bowl. Mix in gently one pint of cream whipped to a 
stiff froth and one dozen lady-fingers cut in small pieces. Turn 
into a mold which has been wet in ice water^ cover tightly, bind 
with a buttered cloth and bury in ice and salt for two hours. 
This is a delicious dessert, and is a good way to use up yolks of 
eggs left from white cake, angel food, etc.

Cantaloupe — Select a melon that feels heavy and solid, with 
rough rind. Wash in cold water, cut in tv/o, take out seeds and 
place lumps of ice in each half. 

Chip Beef with Tomatoes — Pare with a sharp knife two solid 
ripe tomatoes; have sauce-pan hot, with a tablespoonful of melted 
butter in it; cut the tomatoes into inch pieces, dust them with 
sifted flour and stir into the hot butter and let cook five minutes; 
then add a sprinkle of white pepper and a quarter of a pound 
of chip beef, cut very thin. With a fork stir beef and tomatoes, 
cover and let all simmer for ten minutes; add half a teaspoonful 
of minced parsley, if preferred. 

Graham Lunch Bread — One and a half pints of Graham flour, 
one-half pint wheat flour, two tablespoonfuls of white sugar, one 
teaspoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, three- 
quarters of a pint of milk. Sift together the flour, sugar, salt and 
powder twice; add the milk slowly, make into a smooth dough 
that can be easily handled. Flour the board, turn out the dough 
on it, give it a quick, vigorous kneading to complete its smooth- 
ness. Then divide into four pieces, form into long loaves, lay 
them just touching in a shallow pan, wash them over with milk 
and bake in rather hot oven for thirty minutes. When baked 
rub over with a little butter. 

Shredded Wheat Biscuit and Peach Meringue — Peal and slice 
a quarter of a peck of ripe, juicy peaches; put into a bowl and 
sugar thoroughly, an hour before wanted. Carefully divide three 
shredded wheat biscuits into halves; place in a pan in the oven, 
until heated through. Then butter lightly and moisten with the 
peach sirup; place in baking dish, add the peaches, cover and re- 
turn to the oven for five minutes. Have the whites of two eggs, 
beaten stiff with two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, place on 
top of peaches, and place for two minutes in open oven. Serve 
with cream. The wheat biscuits will be found a delicious addition 
to the peaches. 

Clam Soup — One quart of clams; strain off the juice and chop 
up the clams very fine, and let them cook slowly for an hour in 
a pint of the juice. Then stran through a fine sieve, and return 
to the fire, with half a teaspoonful of salt, quarter teaspoonful of 
white pepper. Let one pint of milk come to a scald, add it to the 
clam liquor. Cream together one tablespoonful of flour and one 
of butter. Stir slowly into the soup, let simmer until thick as 
rich cream, and serve in hot soup tureen, with one grate of nut- 
meg. 

Veal Cutlets, Cream Gravy — Have two pounds of veal cutlet 
cut three-quarters of an inch thick, trim and flatten, sprinkle with 
a heaping saltspoonful of salt, dip in beaten egg and crackers 
pounded very fine. Fry rather slowly in very hot lard or good 
bacon dripping, turning when the lower side is brown, and keep- 
ing covered as much as possible, as the steam helps greatly to 
make the meat tender. When cutlet is brown and tender remove 
from the sauce-pan into a hot dish. Pour the fat off remaining in 
pan; dredge from the flour box about a teaspoonful of flour into 



378 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK . 

the pan in which meat was cooked, stirring constantly until a light 
brown, then slowly add one cup of sweet, rich milk, and continue 
stirring until it comes to a boil; add a pinch of salt and dash of 
pepper, strain and pour over the meat. Garnish with parsley. 

Succotash — Six ears of sweet corn, cut with sharp-pointed 
knife through the grain, then off the cob; half a pint of lima 
beans. Place beans in a stew-pan, with just enough boiling water 
to cover them; let boil for half an hour. Then add corn, boil fif- 
teen minutes. Draw off water and add a cup of milk. When this 
boils put in one tablespoonful of floured butter, half a teaspoonful 
of salt, a pinch of pepper and let simmer ten minutes. 

Apple Float — A dozen tart cooking apples; wash and put on 
fire with water enough to cover them; let cook until perfectly 
tender; drain off every drop of water, and with a large spoon 
mash the apples through a fine sieve and let cool. Have the 
whites of two eggs, beaten perfectly stiff, sweeten apples, sea- 
son with nutmeg and beat them into the eggs, a little bit at a 
time, and place the dish in icebox until ready to serve with cold 
cream. Mrs. Thomas Turtle.

add a small half-pint of milk. Stir until boiling. Add a large 
saltspoonful of salt, a good pinch of cayenne, half a teaspoonful 
of onion juice. Then stir in one large cup of chopped cooked 
veal, add a pinch of nutmeg and serve on a hot dish, with a 
poached egg for each person. 

Toast a la Duchesse— Cut neat pieces of stale bread iutp 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 379 

squares, round or oblong shapes; dip in a batter made from one 
cup of milk, one beaten egg, one teaspoonful of melted butter, half 
a cup of sugar^ half a cup of flour. See that the bread is well 
saturated with the batter, but not so soft as to break. Fry brown 
in very hot butter or sweet dripping, and serve with butter or a 
bit of jelly on each. 

Bean Sandwiches — Rub one cupful of baked beans to a smooth 
paste. Add one teaspoonful each of chopped parsley and celery, 
one teaspoonful of onion juice and one-eighth of a teaspoonful of 
made mustard. Spread between thin slices of brown bread. 

White Loaf Cake — Cream together one-half of a cupful of but- 
ter and one and one-half cupfuls of sugar. Add one-half of a 
cupful of milk, one scant teaspoonful of almond extract and two 
cupfuls of sifted flour. Beat well, add the whipped whites of four 
eggs and one heaping teaspoonful of baking powder. Beat again 
and bake in a moderate oven. 

Carrot Soup — Boil enough young carrots to make a pint after 
being rubbed through a colander. Boil them until very soft in two 
quarts of water. Rub through the colander, return to the fire, add 
a thickening of a tablespoonful each of flour and butter, a tea- 
spoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. Add a cup of milk 
or cream, and serve with croutons. 

Collops — It is for the hardness of heart of those who do not 
appreciate the excellence of thin slices of cold, rare beef that this 
form of using yesterday's roast is given: Cut six neat, even slices 
from the rarest portion; put a tablespoonful of butter in a fry- 
ing-pan and brown them quickly on either side; sprinkle with a 
tablespoonful of flour; add three-quarters of a cupful of stock or 
water; add a small cucumber sliced thin and an onion minced; 
cover, cook flfteen minutes and add a teaspoonful of capers, half 
a teaspoonful of salt and a pinch of pepper. Dish, garnish with 
minced parsley and points of toast. 

Baked Cucumbers — Baked cucumbers are delicious. Peel 
good-sized cucumbers, cut them in two lengthwise and remove the 
seeds and soft part, keeping the shape perfect. To three cu- 
cumbers take three-quarters of a cup of soft bread crumbs, and 
rub into them butter the size of a small egg and a teaspoonful 
of finely chopped onion; season this with a large saltspoonful of 
salt and a good dash of cayenne. Sprinkle a saltspoonful of salt 
over the cucumbers, fill them with the seasoned bread crumbs and 
bake until cucumbers are very soft and the filling a nice brown. 

Banana Ice Cream — Pare and beat eight bananas to a smooth 
paste. Put one pint of cream to boil in a farina boiler; when hot, 
add one-half pound of sugar, stirring until dissolved. Add the ba- 
nanas to the cream and sugar when cool; then add one pint of 
milk, and turn into the freezer and freeze.

Tea, hot or cold. 



DINNER.

Sweet potatoes, baked with sugar and butter. 

Lima beans. Sliced cucumbers. 

Snow pudding. Coffee. 



Cold Veal Tongue — Take two veal tongues and cook in boil- 
ing salted water until tender. Leave in the water until cold and 
then remove the skin from them and slice very thin. This makes 
a pretty dish, garnished with celery leaves and hard-boiled eggs. 

Broiled Steak, with Bordelaise Sauce — Place the broiler over 
hot coals or on the top of a very hot stove. Beat two pounds of 
round steak until tender, place on the broiler, and when brown 
on one side turn the other. When done place on a hot platter and 
spread over it hot melted butter and sprinkle over it a saltspoon- 
ful of salt and one of pepper. The sauce is prepared as follows, 
and may be served as a separate dish or poured over the meat: 
Chop one large onion very fine and fry to a light brown in one 
tablespoonful of butter. Mash six large ripe tomatoes through a 
sieve and pour in with the onions. When it begins to boil stir 
in it one clove of garlic, chopped fine, one saltspoonful of salt and 
two of pepper. Cook fifteen minutes. 

Sweet Potatoes, Baked with Sugar and Butter — Steam four 
medium-sized sweet potatoes until tender, or slice them 
while raw, and cook in boiling water for ten minutes. 
Drain from the water and place a layer in the bottom of a bak- 
ing dish. Sprinkle with sugar and place little pieces of butter 
over them. Fill the dish in this way, the sugar and butter be- 
ing on top. Pour over them, nearly covering the potatoes, the 
water in which they were boiled and place in a hot oven for half 
an hour. 

Snow Pudding — Two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, and mix 
with a little cold water. Pour on this one cup of boiling water, 
cook until it looks like starch. Add two tablespoonfuls of sugar 
and the juice of one-half a lemon, also the whites of two eggs, 
beaten stiff, and beat all thoroughly together. Put in a dish 
and set away to cool. 



THE CHIOAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 381

THURSDAY, AUGUST THE NINETEENTH. 



BREAKFAST. 

Cantaloupe. 

Graham mush, molded with fruit. 

Eggs, Newport style. Muffins. 

Coffee. 



LUNCHEON. 

Baked liver. Mustard pickles. 

Whole-wheat gems. Astrakhan jelly. 

Lemonade. 



DINNER. 

Chicken, with cabbage or cauliflower. 
Mashed potatoes. Sliced tomatoes. 
Peach delight. Delicate cake. 
Coffee. 



Graham Mush — To three pints of boiling water use one pint 
of graham flour, one teaspoon of salt. Sift the flour in with left 
hand, while stirring constantly with the right, in order that it 
may be free from lumps. Let it boil for twenty minutes. Just 
before it is done stir in a dozen or more dates which have been 
stoned and cut in small pieces. Turn into a dish which has had 
cold water in, to prevent its sticking. By the time you are readj^ 
to serve it will cut in nice slices. Use sugar and cream. Most 
people make their mushes too stiff; they are not nearly so deli- 
cate. This is nice with a layer of jelly, then the cream. Berries 
and other fruits may be used also. Steamed figs, prepared the day 
before, are nice stirred in. It makes a fine dish for the children's 
breakfast or luncheon. 

Eggs, Newport Style — Take one pint of bread crumbs and 
soak in one pint of milk. Beat eight eggs very light and stir with 
the soaked crumbs, beating five minutes. Have ready a sauce- 
pan, in v/hich are two tablespoonfuls of butter, thoroughly hot, 
but not scorching; pour in the mixture, season with a dash of 
pepper and three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt as the mass is 
opened and stirred with the scrambling, which should be done 
quickly with the point of a knife for three minutes, or until thor- 
oughly hot. Serye on hot platter with squares of buttered toast. 

Baked Liver — Soak the liver in salt and water an hour to 
draw out the blood; wipe dry. Take a dozen strips of fat salt 



382 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

pork as thick and wide as your little finger. Make incisions 
through the liver and insert the pork; flour it, sprinkle a little 
salt over and a dash of pepper. Bake in a hot oven for half an 
hour. Take up liver, place on a hot platter. Put one-half cup 
of boiling water in the pan, stir the gravy, add a pinch of salt, 
a teaspoonful of Worcestershire sauce, then pour it over the liver. 
Serve in slices one-fourth of an inch thick. 

Mustard Pickles — Take cauliflower, little silverskin onions 
and small cucumbers; have about one peck in all. Look them 
over carefully and sprinkle one cup of salt between the layers. 
Pour boiling water over to cover; let them stand all night. Drain 
through colander and wipe dry the following morning. To one- 
half gallon of cider vinegar take one-half pound of mustard, one 
tablespoonful of turmeric, two and one-half tablespoons of curry 
powder, two tablespoons of ginger, one teaspoon of cayenne pep- 
per. Stir all these last together with a little cold vinegar, until 
the lumps are out; then stir it into the half -gallon of vinegar, 
which is on the stove heating, and keep on stirring until it comes 
to a scald. Pour this over the pickles, stir it once or twice for 
a day or two and then put up in quart fruit bottles. It will fill 
twenty quart bottles and will last for a /ear. They are better 
and much more economical than to buy them ready made. 

Whole-Wheat Gems — Three cups of flour, two heaping tea- 
spoons of baking powder, one-half teaspoon of salt, one large 
tablespoon of lard. Rub the lard thoroughly into the flour; add 
enough water to make a very stiff batter. An egg well beaten is 
a great improvement. Pulverize the baking powder and stir it 
in last. Bake in gem pans for thirty or forty-five minutes. 

Astrakhan Jelly — Take Astrakhan apples, wash them, quar- 
ter and core, but do not pare them. Cook until soft with one 
tumbler of water in a granite pan. Do this at evening; then put 
the apples in jelly bag and suspend over earthen dish, and let 
them drain all night; do not squeeze the bag if you want your 
jelly clear. To one pint of juice add one pound of granulated 
sugar; boil twenty minutes; then pour in jelly bowls or glasses. 
After a day or two pour melted parafiin over the top and seal. 

Stewed Chicken with Cauliflower — Wash and cut the chick- 
en up as usual. Have water to cover, one teaspoon of salt, a 
shake or two of pepper, and, if the chicken is tough, put in a 
piece of baking soda, size of a pea. When it begins to boil skim 
carefully. Let the cauliflower lie in salt and water for half an 
hour. Then divide it and put in steamer over the chicken. When 
both are done take them out and place neatly on large, hot plat- 
ter, and put in warming oven. Take two tablespoons of corn- 
starch, stir smooth in a little cold water; add this to the gravy 
in kettle, and a small lump of butter; if not salt enough add a 
trifle more. Stir five minutes until it thickens and tastes done, 
then pour it over the chicken and cauliflower. 

Peach Delight — Take good, ripe peaches; pare them, cut in 
halves, leave a few pits in, put them in a granite pudding-dish, 
a layer of peaches and one of sugar, until you have two layers of 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. ns 

peaches; dot it with bits of butter; add one teacup of water. Use 
one cup of sugar, in which you have thoroughly mixed two table- 
spoons of flour. Now make an upper crust thus: One and one-half 
cups of sifted flour, one-half cup of lard, one-third teaspoon of salt, 
just water enough to mix, and one teaspoon of baking powder. 
Stir with knife; handle as little as possible in rolling out; make 
incisions in crust for juice, which will not run over the oven bot- 
tom if dish is deep. It needs no sauce, but cream may be used if 
you wish. Serve in pieces like a pie, with fruit on top. 

Delicate Cake— One cup of sugar, two scant tablespoons of 
butter, whites of four eggs, one-half cup of milk, one and one- 
half cups of flour, one heaping teaspoon of baking powder, stirred 
in just before you put it in the oven. It hardly seehis necessary 
to give all the details in cakemaking (it has been given so many 
times in the menus). Sifting the flour and baking powder to- 
gether, as most recipes prescribe, is a great mistake. Baking 
powder should never be added until everything else is in the dish 
and the mass thoroughly beaten. The reason will be appreciat- 
ed by every thoughtful person. The moment the milk or other 
liquid comes in contact with the powder effervescence begins, and 
by the time the dough is ready for the oven it has entirely ceased 
and the mass is likely to be as "dull, stale and profltless" as a 
glass of second-hand soda water. If all the other ingredients are 
well, beaten, the powder added at the last moment and the cake 
put into the oven as hurriedly as possible, the process of effer- 
vescence will be assisted by the heat, and the dough will rise in 
a light, spongy mass. This is the secret of the extra-flne cake 
and biscuit that many non-professional housekeepers boast of. 
Why not let all have the benefit? It is quite as much of an ac- 
complishment to be a good cook as it is to paint a good picture 
or execute a piece of music brilliantly. 

Berries — A good way to prepare berries for v/inter use is to 
heat the berries and press them through a sieve, and to one pound 
of pulp and juice add three-quarters of a pound of granulated 
sufar, cook twenty minutes, seal hot or put in fruit cans. (In 
this way we get rid of the seeds, which are so hurtful, and which 
become harder by cooking.) I wanted this in the menu, but there 
did not seem to be any room for it.

Lamb Kidneys a la Terrapin — Take six lamb kidneys, cut in 
halves. Throw into cold water and allow to boil about fifteen 
minutes. Make a white sauce of one tablespoonful of butter, one 
of flour, one teacup of milk, the butter added slowly after the 
former are smoothly mixed. Cut the kidneys into smaller pieces, 
with one hard-boiled egg chopped fine, half teaspoonful of salt, 
one-fourth teaspoonful white pepper, two teaspoonfuls minced 
parsley. Drop all into the hot sauce for two minutes. Cold 
chicken or calves' liver are also good prepared thus. 

Potatoes — Maitre d' Hotel — Cut four large cold potatoes in 
rather thin slices. Melt butter size of an egg, the juice of half a 
lemon, a few leaves of parsley chopped very fine, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt, one-fourth of white pepper. Spread this, all 
mixed together, over the potatoes, cover long enough over the 
boiling water for the butter, etc., to penetrate the potatoes. 

Eggs a la Carraccas — One-fourth pound of dried beef chopped 
fine, one tablespoonful minced onion, one cup stewed tomatoes, 
four raw and two hard-boiled eggs, two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
two tablespoonfuls grated cheese, one-quarter teaspoonful of salt, 
dash of cayenne. Put onions first in the melted butter, then the 
tomatoes, then the chopped beef, the eggs, cheese and seasoning, 
each in quick succession. Stir like scrambled eggs. Serve on very 
fiaky crackers or toast squares, garnish with the hard-boiled eggs, 
sliced. A dish for the gods. 

The ordinary red wild plum now so abundant and cheap has 
a rich flavor when stewed and sweetened. Serve cold in large 
saucers, with tablespoonful of the cottage cheese in same dish. 
To be eaten together with bread and butter. 

Cream of Celery Soup — One bunch of celery, one pint of water, 
one pint of milk, one tablespoonful minced lemon peeling, one 
tablespoonful minced onion, one tablespoonful of butter, one table- 
spoonful flour, one-half teaspoonful salt, one-fourth teaspoonful 
Vv^hite pepper. Cook the celery twenty minutes in the water, the 
onions minced very fine in the milk. Combine them with the sea- 
soning and serve quickly after three minutes together. 

Compote of Peaches — Cut the pared peaches in halves, put in 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK, 385 

the sauce-pan, allow them to become heated through in their 
own juice, with four tablespoonfuls of sugar sprinkled over. Mois- 
ten one tablespoonful of cornstarch with cold water, add two tea- 
spoonfuls lemon juice and one egg very lightly whipped. Put the 
peaches on squares of sponge cake hollow side up. Take the sirup 
of their juice and mix the cornstarch, etc., in it. Place on stove 
and allow them to bubble up together, and when slightly cooled 
pour over the peaches; put in a cold place. The sirup will jelly 
all about the fruit and form a delicious dessert. Serve with plain 
cream. This may be prepared an hour or two before dinner.

will very much improve the flavor of dish. Take two eggs, beat 
them, add breakfastcup of flour and same of milk, half teaspoon 
salt, pinch cayenne pepper. Beat the batter v^^ell, add the meat, 
have gem pans hot and well greased, drop a good tablespoonful 
into each pan and bake fifteen minutes.

386 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Gravy — Make half pint of stock from the bones, wash well 
the skins and stems of mushrooms you will use for dinner, add 
them to stock, strain and thicken with one teaspoonful of corn- 
starch; add one pickled gherkin chopped fine and one-fourth tea- 
spoonful salt. Put the peeled mushrooms on ice or they will turn 
black. 

Rice a la Turque — Put into a sauce-pan three teacups stock or 
water and a tablespoonful extract of beef. Peel three tomatoes, 
cut small and add to stock; let come to a boil and strain. Put 
liquor back into pan and throw in one cup of Patna rice which 
has been well washed and dried; let remain on stove till rice has 
absorbed all the liquid; add teaspoon salt, quarter teaspoonful 
pepper; just before serving add half ounce butter, stir lightly 
to separate the grains. 

Orange Tea — Peel and take off all the white skin from an 
orange; put a slice in each cup and pour over a light tea, hot; 
sweeten to taste; cream spoils it; very refreshing. 

Clam Bisque — Take a pint of clams, pick them over and chop 
them fine; put them into a pint of water, adding all their liquor; 
set them on the stove and stew till all the goodness is extracted; 
say twenty minutes. Strain and set the liquor to settle; put a 
pint of milk to boil, thicken with a tablespoon of flour mixed 
with a little cold milk; strain the clam liquor very carefully lest 
there should be sand or bits of clam. Add to the milk, put in a 
tablespoonful of butter, one-half teaspoon of salt and pinch of 
cayenne. Serve hot. 

Lamb Chops — A pound and a half nice loin chops. Put one 
ounce of butter or drippings in pan; when hot put in the chops; 
half cook and turn them over. Take the mushrooms already 
peeled (one-half pound), put them on the chops, cupside up; 
sprinkle over them one-half teaspoon salt and one-fourth tea- 
spoon pepper. Take two ounces butter, break into bits and put 
on the mushrooms, return to oven and cook ten minutes longer; 
the mushrooms should be quite tender. 

Stuffed Tomatoes — Mix well together one cupful fine bread 
crumbs, one tablespoonful finely minced parsley, one tablespoon- 
ful melted butter, half teaspoon salt, pinch cayenne, and two 
well beaten eggs. Scoop out six large tomatoes, fill with mix- 
ture and bake twenty minutes. 

Citron Cake — Lemon Buns — Six ounces of butter and six 
ounces of sugar; beat to a good cream. Add ^'■olks of four eggs, 
beat again; put two teaspoonfuls of baking powder into 
three-quarters of a pound of flour and sift into mixture; add one 
teacup of miik and thoroughly well beat. Add the whites of the 
eggs previously beaten to a stiff froth; now stir lightly a few 
turns to mix the whites in. Divide the mixture; put half teaspoon 
lemon to one-half and fill gem pans; bake in moderate oven. Cut 
two ounces citron peel very thin and add to other half and bake 
in cake tin. 

Hints — For baking choose apples which will give under the 
thumbs, when pressed. 

To prevent your cakes from sticking, flour your tins after 
greasing them. 



THK CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 3if 

To make your cakes light, do not beat the mixture after you 
have added the whites of the eggs. 

Use Patna rice if you wish the grains to separate nicely.

Snow Watermelon — Take the heart out of a melon that has 
been on ice and cut in thick slices. Make snow by pounding a 
piece of ice in a clean crash bag until it looks like snow. Have 
the plates cold by placing them in the ice box for half an hour, 
and put a heaping tablespoonful of snow on each slice. Dainty 
and delicious these hot mornings. 

White Souffle — Take one set of calf's brains, which are sold at 
8 cents at this season, and remove the red membrane; soak them 
in cold water for ten minutes and then place them to cool in a 
pint of cold water, in which you have put one tablespoonful of 
lemon juice and half a teaspoonful of salt. Boil ten minutes, 
take from the fire and plunge into cold water to harden. Cut into 
dice, and mix with a cupful of white sauce made with one table- 
spoonful of butter, one heaping tablespoonful of flour melted to- 
gether, and one coffee cup of hot milk, added when perfectly 
smooth. Season with one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, three 
shakes of black pepper and two of red pepper, one-quarter tea- 
spoonful of salt and five drops of onion juice; add two well-beaten 
eggs, yolks only, and set away to cool; then add the whites of 
the eggs beaten very stiff, and bake twenty minutes in a hot oven. 
Serve immediately. 

Buttered Toast — ^Cut thin slices of white bread. Toast to a 
golden brown on both sides, spread with sweet, fresh butter and 
send to the table piping hot in a napkin. 



ZHH THE CHICAGO RECORD COOlC BOOET, 

Coffee — Grind your coffee fresh every morning if you want it 
good, and make it at the table in a Marion Harland or French 
coffee pot. Allov/ one tablespoonful for each person. Have the 
water boiling and the pot hot, and serve v>^ith rich cream. 

Ham a la Venison — Take eight or ten thin slices of cold-boiled 
ham. Spread each slice with a thin coating of made mustard, and 
add a dash of cayenne pepper to each slice. In your blazer put 
one tablespoonful of butter and a third of a tumblerful of cur- 
rant jelly; melt together. Then lay in enough slices of ham to 
cover the dish, and let them brown a little. Serve very hot. An 
old English recipe, and a very good one. Try it. 

Soft Gingerbread — One cup of molasses, one teaspoonful of 
soda, one large tablespoonful of ginger, one-half teaspoonful of 
salt, one-half cupful of butter, one cup of milk and three cups of 
pastry flour. Mix in the order given and bake in small tins thirty 
minutes. 

Curds — You can buy such delicious curd at the creamery 
now that it is hardly worth the while to make it at home. Still 
if one has plenty of sour milk it is well to know how to make the 
curd. Take two quarts of solid clabber, put on back of stove, 
where it will get hot, but not boil. When the curd separates 
from the whey turn it into a cheese cloth bag and let it dry sev- 
eral hours. Turn out and mix with it one-half teaspoonful of 
salt, two tablespoonfuls of cream; mix lightly. Serve in a small 
glass dish. Should the milk boil the curd is ruined, as it be- 
comes hard and indigestible. This is delicious with warm gin- 
gerbread. 

Iced Tea — Allow one teaspoonful of tea to one cup of water 
for each person. Steep in cold water four hours. Pill tail glasses 
one-third full of cracked ice; fill up with tea, and serve with thin 
slices of iGm.on and sugar to suit taste. 

Black Bean Soup — Two cups of black beans soaked over night. 
In morning put on to boil in two quarts of cold water, with one 
small onion and two large tomatoes. Boil four or five hours, or 
until beans are soft. Add water as it boils away. Strain and rub 
through a sieve, and add one tablespoonful of flour and two of 
butter, mixed thoroughly together, with one-half cup of cold 
v/ater; add v/hile soup is boiling. Season with one full teaspoon- 
ful of salt and half a level teaspoonful of pepper, two dashes of 
cayenne and a saltspoonful of mustard. Cut a lemon and two 
hard-toiled eggs in thin slices, put into the tureen and pour the 
hot soup over them. 

Veal Oysters — Get one and one-half pounds of tender veal 
from the leg, cut into pieces size and shape of an oyster, dip in 
olive oil and roll in fine cracker crumbs. Then dip into egg and 
then into cracker crumbs again. Season each piece with a small 
pinch of salt and a dash of pepper on each side; dip into hot 
fat and fry a delicate brown. Serve piled up in the center of a 
platter. Surround with crisp lettuce leaves. In the center of half 
a dozen of the lettuce leaves put a heaping teaspoonful of tartare 
sauce. Serve the lettuce with the veaL 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 389 

Tartare Sauce — One teaspoonf iil of mustard, one-half teaspoon- 
ful of salt, ten drops of onion juice, yolks of two eggs, one-half 
teacupful of oil, three tablespoonfuls of vinegar, and a tablespoon- 
ful each of capers, parsley and olive. Mix in the order given; add 
the yolk, and beat well; add oil slowly, and the vinegar a little at 
a time. Then add the chopped ingredients, and put on ice until 
served. 

Carrots and Green Peas — Boil one pint of green peas until 
tender. Boil one pint of carrots cut into dice until tender. Mix 
and season with a tablespoonful of butter and half of a tea- 
spoonful of salt. 

Delmonico Potatoes — Pare and cut into very small dice enough 
potatoes to fill a quart measure. Butter a granite dish (one two 
inches deep), and put a layer of potatoes and a sprinkle each of 
salt, pepper, chopped onion and parsley; dot bits of butter about 
two inches apart all over. Then another layer of potatoes, with 
the seasoning and butter, until all the potatoes are used. Pill up 
with milk enough to let the potatoes show through, and bake in a 
moderate oven three-quarters of an hour. It will take two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, half a. teaspoonful of 
pepper and one tablespoonful of chopped onion and parsley to- 
gether. These potatoes are especially good with meats that are 
served without gravy. They should be rich and creamy. Should 
they get too dry in baking, add more milk. 

Frozen Peaches — Pare and slice enough ripe peaches to make 
a quart; add one pint of sugar and one quart of cold water. When 
the sugar is dissolved, freeze. Serve with macaroons.

390 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Steamed Apples — Take some cooking apples (about five or 
six) and one-half cup sugar. Quarter and core the fruit, but 
leave the skin on. Put in vegetable dish, a layer of apple and one 
of sugar, until you have two layers of each. Place in steamer. 
When done serve from same dish, as they should be eaten while 
warm. Sprinkle a little more sugar on each dish on top. 

Breakfast Bacon and Fried Potatoes — Cut bacon in very thin 
slices. Have the frying-pan sizzling hot when the meat is put 
in. When done to a crisp lay on hot platter, but leave the fat in 
pan. Now sliee some cold boiled potatoes lengthwise (either 
Irish or sweet ones) and fry them in the hot bacon fat. With a 
shake of pepper it seasons them nicely. 

Green Corn Cake — Cut the corn from the cob, the same as in 
directions for Indian pudding (in this menu). Use four large 
young ears. If small corn is used it will need double the quan- 
tity. Melt a tablespoonful of butter, add a teaspoonful of flour, 
a cup of sweet milk and the yolks of two eggs, well beaten and 
added carefully to the milk after it has begun to boil. Stir in 
the corn, a quarter teaspoonful of salt, and finally the whites of 
the eggs, well beaten to a stiff froth; pour the mixture into two 
deep pie plates and bake for twenty minutes in a hot oven. 

Cucumbers and Cream — Slice very thin four large cucumbers, 
salt them and let stand one hour. Squeeze them in a piece of 
cheese cloth. Take one-half cup of sweet cream; whip it until 
light and pour over them; add one cup of good vinegar. Serve 
at once. This is a German dish, and a novelty; but just try it. 

Apple Custard Pie — One quart of tart stewed apple sifted 
through sieve, one-fourth of a pound of butter, four eggs, one 
heaping cup of sugar; then taste, and if not sweet enough add a 
little more sugar. Now make a nice crust, only an under crust 
(directions have been given for pastry so often in this column of 
The Record it is not necessary to repeat.) If you wish you can 
save out the whites of two eggs and put on a meringue top, but it 
is good enough without. 

Cheese Straws — Three tablespoonfuls of flour, three table- 
spoonfuls of rich cheese grated, one tablespoonful of melted but- 
ter, one tablespoonful of milk, one egg (yolk only), one saltspoon- 
ful of salt, one-half saltspoonful of red pepper and same quantity 
of nutmeg. Mix the dry ingredients, add milk, egg and butter; 
stir with spoon and add enough flour to roll; roll very thin and 
cut into sticks three or four inches long. Bake in a slow oven 
until light brown. Serve with pie or with black coffee. 

Smothered Steak — A good way to cook a tough steak: One 
pound and a half of steak, five or six medium-sized onions, one cup 
of water. Slice the onions and put a layer in spider; then the 
steak, another layer of onions on top, a few dashes of pepper. 
Cover closely, but watch it, and if the water boils away add more 
hot water from the teakettle. When onions are done the meat 
will be tender. Lay on hot platter. Take two tablespoonfuls corn- 
starch, mixed smoothly in cold water, add one half teaspoon level 
full of salt, stir it in the gravy until it tastes done, then pour 
it over the steak. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. • 391 

Cold Slaw — Has disappeared from most tables, and yet it is 
extremely palatable, especially in hot weather. Beat two eggs 
in a bowl that fits in the top of a teakettle; add a gill of vinegar 
and water mixed, an ounce of butter and an even teaspoonful 
of salt. Place bowl over boiling water, and when hot stir the 
contents until they become as thick as custard. Strain and leave 
it to cool, and when quite cold pour over raw sliced cabbage, only 
the white inside leaves being used. 

Corn Pudding — Select firm, sweet ears of good sized corn cut 
from the cob in the following manner: With a keen-bladed 
knife cut the corn off the cob, cutting only to the depth of half 
the kernel; scrape off the rest. This leaves a large portion of 
the husk of the kernel on the cob, and removes none of the cob, 
as is frequently the case when the corn is cut close. To twelve 
ears of large sweet-corn, cut from the cob in this way, add a pint 
and a half of rich milk. Beat four eggs with a teaspoonful of 
salt; add, also, a pinch of pepper. Bake the pudding in a greased 
granite dish in a slow oven for two hours. 

Lemon Ice — Two quarts of water, four teacups of sugar, two 
tablespoonfuls of flour. Boil; when perfectly cold add the grated 
rind of two lemons and the juice of four, and the whites of four 
eggs well beaten. Mix the flour and sugar thoroughly before put- 
ting it in the water to boil. When cold turn it into the freezer, 
and freeze by turning, opening it three times to beat it all up 
together. 

Note: — Apples, it is said, are now considered to contain far 
more brain food than any other fruit or vegetable, and to be 
much more nutritious than potatoes, which enter so largely into 
the component parts of every meal.

392 * THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

A Spanish Delicacy— Heat an earthen dish over a moderate 
fire and melt in it a piece of butter the size of an egg; add a 
small onion, minced fine, one-half teaspoonful of salt, a dash of 
pepper, a teaspoonful of minced parsley, and as much minced 
Chile pepper or a tablespoonful of sweet pepper; break six eggs, 
one by one, into the boiling butter, and turn them as soon as they 
are set, using great care not to break the yolks. Serve very hot in 
the same dish. 

Graham Puffs — One and one-half cups of graham flour, one 
cup sifted wheat flour, two teaspoonfuls of sugar, half a teacup- 
ful of butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, two cups of new milk, 
three eggs. Mix salt and flour; add the milk, and beat smooth; 
froth the yolks of the eggs separately from the whites; cream the 
butter; add the eggs and then the batter. Bake in buttered gem 
pans from thirty to forty minutes, but do not keep them in the 
oven after they have well popped over the cups. Serve at once. 

Salted- Walnut Sandwiches — Spread very thin slices of Boston 
brown bread with butter; then chop walnuts rather flne, sprinkle 
with salt, and put a layer of the nuts between two slices of bread. 
One and one-half cups of nuts will be required for ten slices of 
bread. 

Moonshine — Beat the whites of six eggs in a broad plate to a 
very stiff froth; then add gradually twelve tablespoonfuls pow- 
dered sugar, beating for not less than twenty minutes, and then 
beat in three large peaches, which have been pared and cut in 
tiny bits, and set on ice until thoroughly chilled. In serving, 
pour in each saucer some rich cream, sweetened and flavored with 
vanilla. 

Cutlets a la Duchesse— Two pounds of lamb cutlets, one large 
cupful of cream, one tablespoonful of onion juice, four tablespoon- 
fuls of butter, one of flour, two whole eggs, the yolks of four more, 
two tablespoonfuls of finely chopped ham, one of lemon juice, one 
teaspoonful salt and one-quarter teaspoonful pepper. Put two 
tablespoonfuls of butter in a frying-pan. Season the cutlets with 
some of the salt and pepper, and when the butter is hot put them 
in it, fry gently for five minutes, set away to cool. Put the re- 
mainder of the butter in a small frying-pan, and when hot stir 
in the fiour. Cook one minute, being careful not to brown. Stir 
in the cream. Have the ham, the yolks of eggs and the onion 
and lemon juice beaten together. Stir this mixture into the boil- 
ing sauce. Stir for about one minute and remove from the fire. 
Season well with remaining pepper and salt. Dip the cutlets in 
this sauce, being careful to cover every part, and set away to cool. 
When cold dip them in beaten egg and bread crumbs. Fry in 
boiling fat for one minute. Arrange them in a circle on a hot 
dish, and have green peas in the center and cream sauce poured 
around. 

Corn Timbales— Beat six eggs just enough to mix, add one- 
quarter of a teaspoonful of white pepper, one-half a teaspoonful 
of salt, one and one-half cupfuls of milk, two cupfuls of grated 
corn. Stir well and fill the greased molds two-thirds full. Set in 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 393 

a pan, pour boiling water around them, cover and bake in a mod- 
erate oven until the centers are firm. Serve with cream sauce. 

Rice and Apple Pudding — Two heaping tablespoonfuls of rice, 
half a pint of milk, two eggs, three tablespoonfuls of sugar, six 
sour apples. Boil the rice in the milk; when quite soft, add yolks 
of eggs and sugar, and let it cook three minutes, stirring rapidly. 
Take from the fire and line a pudding-dish with it^ and fill up the 
center of the dish with the cored and pared tart apples, which 
have been stewed soft in sugar and water with the rind and juice 
of a lemon. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth and spread 
them over the apples and rice; scatter sugar plentifully over the 
top, and brown quickly in the oven. Janet Van Allen.

Flapjacks — One pint of sour milk or cream, one pint of flour, 
pinch of salt, two eggs, a level teaspoon of soda; beat all together 
and bake on a v/ell-greased griddle. A piece of pork an inch 
square, run on a tin fork, makes a nice greaser. 

Quaking Omelet — This is a simple breakfast dish. It calls for 
four eggs, a tablespoonful of milk, one-third teaspoonful of salt, 
a quarter saltspoonful of pepper. Whip the whites into a stiff 
froth and place in a pan of boiling water and let cook until firm. 
In the meantime beat the yolks and milk together and turn into 
a hot frying-pan, which has been well buttered; sprinkle on salt 
and pepper, and set the frying-pan in the oven, and let remain six 
minutes. Carefully dish the whites, without breaking them, on to 



394 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

a liot dish, and turn the yolks out on them exactly in the center, 
leaving a white rim all around, and you have a pretty dish. 

Fried Apples — Take three large, sour apples, pare and then 
core with an apple-corer (a little tin instrument worth its weight 
in gold, but costing only 5 cents), then cut across in thin slices 
and fry in hot fat; when done lay on porous paper to drain, then 
dish and sprinkle with white sugar. 

Jelly Fritters — Put three tablespoonfuls flour into a bowl and 
pour over it sufficient hot water to make it into a stiff paste, stir- 
ring well to prevent its getting lumpy. When cool break into it 
the yolks of two eggs, then the whites, stir and beat all together. 
Drop a dessertspoonful of batter into hot fat and fry a light brown. 
Serve on a hot dish with a spoonful of currant jelly on each. These 
are to be eaten with sweetened cream or maple molasses. 

Frizzled Beef — Chip a quarter-pound of dried beef as thin as 
paper with a very sharp knife; melt a teaspoonful of butter in a 
frying-pan, stir the beef about in it for two or three minutes and 
serve. 

Watermelon Diamonds — Take a fully ripe watermelon, put on 
ice until thoroughly cold, slice, remove the seed, and cut into dia- 
mond shapes; place in a glass dish and sprinkle each layer with 
sugar. Serve as any other fruit in saucers. You will be de- 
lighted. 

That nothing need be wasted, you can make delightful pre- 
serves out of the rind. 

"Virginia Fried Chicken — We will omit the soup to-day, as we 
have cream gravy with the chicken, and begin our dinner with 
this dish. If you live in the city, we will suppose you have bought 
your spring chicken ready dressed (though it is cheaper to buy 
them alive and have them dressed at home). At this time of year 
it should be of good size, so we will divide it into eleven pieces, 
but we will take only the best for our fry, leaving the bony parts 
(which it is a waste to fry) for a breakfast stew; these cooked 
with potatoes and a dressing of milk and butter added are very 
nice. Take two tablespoonfuls of flour, into which you have sifted 
one teaspoonful of salt and one-half teaspoonful of pepper, roll the 
pieces of chicken in this and place in a frying-pan in which two 
tablespoonfuls of suet and butter mixed has been heated; cover 
until brown on one side, then turn and cover again. When both 
sides are a golden brown, set on the back of the stove where it 
will cook slowly until you are ready to serve it. Dish on a hot 
platter and garnish with curled parsley. 

Pour into tne frying-pan a teacup and a half of milk; when it 
boils up stir in a teaspoonful of flour which has been moistened 
with milk or water and rubbed into a smooth paste; add a half- 
teaspoonful of salt, a quarter-teaspoonful of pepper and a tea- 
spoonful of chopped parsley. Serve with the chicken, in a gravy- 
boat. 

Egg Corn Bread — One egg, one teacup of sour milk, one cup 
of cornmeal, one-half cup of flour, one tablespoonful of sugar, one 
tablespoonful of lard, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-half tea- 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 395 

spoonful of soda dissolved in one tablespoonful of hot water. Beat 
all together and bake in a cake-pan in a hot oven. 

Southern Mashed Potatoes— I have never eaten any potatoes 
that tasted quite so good as those cooked by my "old mammy," 
but I will try and tell how I have seen her do it; as for her telling 
how she did it, she neither would nor could. After six large pota- 
toes were boiled and mashed they were seasoned with a table- 
spoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of salt, a half-teaspoonful of pep- 
per and a half-cup of cream — if she had it — then they were beaten 
into snowflakes and heaped into a mound on a pie-plate, topped 
with a teaspoonful of butter, placed on the upper shelf of the oven 
and baked until the whole outside was a rich brown; v/hen eaten 
these flakes simply melted in the mouth. 

Apple Dumplings — To prepare a paste for this favorite dessert 
take one pint of flour, one tablespoonful of lard, one-half teaspoon- 
ful of soda dissolved in hot water, one teaspoonful of cream of 
tartar and one-half teaspoonful of salt, sifted through the flour. 
Use sweet milk or water and mix the dough a little stiffer than 
for biscuits; roll out a little thicker than pie crust, cut into squares 
and put in the center of each a nice, sour apple, pared and cored; 
fill the hole left by the core with sugar, a bit of butter and a clove; 
bring the corners of the dough together, pinching well to make a 
firm ball; tie in loose cloths, which have been dipped in hot water 
and floured on the inside. Boil steadily in plenty of water one 
hour. Some prefer these steamed or baked. Serve hot with sweet- 
ened cream or butter and sugar. Dumpling cloths may be crochet- 
ed in a close stitch from stout tidy cotton if desired. They leave 
a pretty pattern upon the paste v/hen opened. 

This is an economical and delicious dinner, prepared as an 
"old Virginia" cook would do it. It is nicest served in two courses 
only. The order in which it should be prepared, so that no dish 
may be spoiled by waiting for the rest to cook, is as follows: 

First, prepare the tomatoes, omitting the dressing, and place 
on ice; next pare the potatoes and lay in cold salt water; then 
cut up and wash the chicken. Now see to your fire and get the 
water for your dumplings ready; then prepare the apples and 
make the dumplings; this should be done about one hour before 
time to serve the dinner. As soon as they are bobbing about in 
the boiling water, put on the potatoes; now it is time to make 
the corn bread and put the chicken on to fry; by this time the 
potatoes are ready to prepare for baking, and you have all your 
dinner under way. Margaret M. Withrow.

thoroughly; have ready nine green sweet peppers, with seeds re- 
moved and soaked in salt water for six hours. Stuff the peppers 
with the mixture; stand up on points in a baking dish; put half 
spoonful of butter or drippings on top of each; pour a little boil- 
ing water around them. Bake one and a half hours. 

Baked Cabbage — Parboil one head of cabbage flfteen minutes, 
pour off water, put on fresh boiling water and cook until tender. 
Let it get cold. Chop, add two beaten eggs, one tablespoonful of 
butter, three tablespoonfuls of cream, a heaping saltspoonful of 
pepper and three-quarters teaspoonful of salt. Mix and bake 
until brown. Serve hot.

Cream Boulie — One quart of milk, boil and add one-half cup 
of sugar; boil up and set back to keep warm; take half a cup of 
sugar, one spoonful of water, dissolve and brown on stove to your 
taste, stirring constantly while browning; add this to the milk 
and sugar and add three small tablespoonfuls cornstarch and three 
eggs beaten with a pinch of salt; cook up, strain, let cool and 
freeze. 

This is a convenient menu where one is limited as to number 
of stove burners, as it is all baked at once.

FRIDAY, AUGUST THE TWENTY-SEVENTH. 



BREAKFAST. 

Green corn omelet served with lettuce. 

Popovers. Fried bananas. 

Coffee. 



LUNCHEON. 

A luncheon relish. Potato cream. 

Cheese and celery sandwiches. 

Pears. Milk punch. 



DINNER. 

Rice and tomato soup. 

Black sea bass, boiled — poulette sauce. 

Potato balls — parsley butter. 

Stewed cucumbers. 

Apple charlotte. Tea. 



Popovers— Beat two eggs very light, add two cups of flour and 
two cups of milk, one saltspoon salt. It is better to mix the flour 
with only a part of the milk into a very smooth batter, then add 
the egg and the remainder of the milk. No baking powder is 
required. Beat well; have gem pans very hot and well buttered 
and the oven very hot. Fill irons tv/o-thirds full and bake. 

Fried Bananas — For the flnishing touch to a summer break- 
fast nothing is more delicious than fried bananas. Choose fine, 
ripe fruit; draw off the skins and cut each banana in two cross- 
wise. Salt them lightly, dip each in beaten egg; then roll in 
cracker crumbs. Cook till a delicate brown in deep, boiling fat. 
Serve with a rich fruit sauce made of one cupful of boiling 
water, butter the size of an egg, a cupful of sugar, a table- 
spoonful of cornstarch, one-half cupful of minced fruit, consist- 
ing of seeded raisins, chopped citron and English currants and 
three tablespoonfuls of lemon juice. Mix sugar and cornstarch. 



398 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Melt the butter in the boiling water and pour upon sugar and 
cornstarch. Cook three minutes and add the other ingredients. 
Unless the butter is quite salty the sauce is improved by adding 
a trifle of salt. 

A Luncheon Relish — Take a couple of lambs' hearts and 
livers, stew them gently in water sufficient to cover them until 
done; then chop fine, add half a cup of bread crumbs, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, a teaspoonful each of chopped thyme, parsley and 
onion. Put all with the liquor in which they were cooked, boiled 
down to a gravy (or a cupful), in a pan and bake half an hour. 
Garnish with three or four hard-boiled eggs, cut into rings and 
serve, or the eggs can be omitted. 

Potato Cream — Peel, boil and mash six medium-sized potatoes, 
seasoning with a tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of salt, 
half-saltspoonful of pepper and lastly the well-beaten whites of 
four eggs, mixed in until the mass is creamy. Set in oven to get 
very hot. 

Cheese and Celery Sandwiches— Whip a gill of cream, thick 
and sweet, and add to it sufficient grated cheese (Parmesan if pre- 
ferred, but any sharp, well-flavered American cheese that can be 
grated will answer) to make a stiff paste; spread with this and 
sprinkle thickly with very finely minced white stalks of celery. 
These must be made just before serving, as they soon become 
tasteless if made of Parmesan cheese. If sapsago cheese is used 
only a very thin layer of it is required. 

Milk Punch Without Liquor— For each person beat thoroughly 
an egg with a teaspoonful of sugar; add to this two-thirds of a 
goblet of shaved ice and milk; cover closely with a shaker, or a 
large goblet inverted, and shake up and down until the ice is 
nearly melted. Dust the top with grated nutmeg. 

Rice and Tomato Soup— This is a nice summer soup, and a 
pleasant change from meat soups. Use one can or its equivalent 
in fresh tomatoes, one-third of a cupful of rice, a large onion, a 
large slice of carrot, a quart of water, three tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter, three teaspoonfuls of salt, half a teaspoonful of pepper and 
two tablespoonfuls of flour. Cut the onion and carrot very fine, 
and put them into a small frying-pan with the butter. Cook slowly 
for twenty minutes. Put the tomato and a quart of water into a 
stewpan and bring to a boil. Skim the vegetables from the but" 
ter, and add them to the tomato and water. Put the flour with the 
butter remaining in the pan, and cook until smooth and frothy, 
stirring all the v/hile; then add the mixture in the stewpan, and 
pet the pan where its contents will simmer for half an hour. Then 
rub this mixture through a sieve, pressing everything through 
except the seeds' and skins. Wash the rice and put it in the soup 
pot, pouring the strained mixture over the rice. Add the salt and 
pepper, and set the soup-pot where its contents will cook slowly 
for an hour. Stir the soup several times to prevent the rice from 
sticking to the kettle. Serve very hot. 

Black Sea Bass— Procure a fish weighing two and a half or 
three pounds; cleanse and dress well; put it in a fish-boiler in 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 399 

slightly salted water and a gill of vinegar. If you have no fish 
kettle, wrap the fish in a piece of stout white musiin before putting 
in water. This holds its shape and prevents wasting. Fish should 
never boil violently, but simmer gently. Sea bass of this size 
should simmer half an hour. When done remove the fish to a hot 
platter and serve with a sauce. Fresh fish, if boiled, is much 
more delicate and better suited to an invalid, or one whose diges- 
tion is weak, than when cooked in any other way. 

Poulette Sauce — This is nice with boiled fish or fowl or deli- 
cate vegetable. Take half a cupful of butter, three tablespoon- 
fuls of flour, the yolks of three eggs, one pint of stock or water, 
one tablespoonful of lemon juice, one-eighth teaspoonful pepper, 
one level teaspoonful salt. Beat the butter and flour together un- 
til smooth and light, then add salt, pepper and lemon juice. 
Gradually pour the boiling stock or water upon this mixture, and 
simmer for ten minutes. Beat the yolks in a small saucepan, 
and gradually pour the sauce upon them. Set the saucepan in 
another containing boiling water and stir for two minutes; then 
remove from the stove without delay. 

Parsley Butter — Beat three tablespoonfuls of butter to a 
cream, add one-half a tablespoonful of lemon juice and one of 
parsley, chopped, half a teaspoonful of salt and one-eighth tea- 
spoonful of pepper. Beat these ingredients into the butter and 
it is ready for use. This is also nice to spread upon fried or 
boiled fish, and then it should have a full tablespoonful of lemon 
juice. 

Stewed Cucumbers — After peeling, cut four or five large cu- 
cumbers into slices half an inch thick; just cover them with hot 
water, and boil them ten or fifteen minutes, till they are tender, 
but not broken; then drain off the water. Put two cups of cream 
in a saucepan, season with a teaspoonful of salt and one-eighth 
teaspoonful of pepper and a half-tablespoonful of butter. When 
it comes to a boil drop in the cucumbers and let them get heated 
through, shaking the saucepan to prevent burning. This may be 
served on slices of toast like asparagus, and is a very delicate 
dish. 

Apple Charlotte — Use a quart of sliced sour apples, a pint of 
fine bread crumbs, a cupful of sugar, a pint of sweet milk, a 
tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of cinnamon, one or two 
eggs, a pinch of salt. Steam the apples soft. Butter a pudding 
dish. Put alternate layers of bread crumbs and apple in the dish, 
sprinkling the apples with sugar and cinnamon, with a layer of 
crumbs on top. Beat the egg, using the remaining yolk from the 
potato cream, add the salt and milk and turn the mixture over 
the bread and apples. Place the butter in bits on top and bake 
in moderate oven half an hour, or until the milk is absorbed. 
Eat with sweetened cream. Shirley de Forest.

SATURDAY, AUGUST THE TWENTY-EIGHTH. 



BREAKFAST. 

Grapes. 

Rolled oats. Sugar and cream. 

Boiled salted salmon. Baked potatoes. 

Muffins. Coffee. 



LUNCHEON. 

Welsh rarebit. Sweet potato fritters. 

Cake. Italian jelly. 

Tea. 



DINNER. 

Mock bisque soup.

Cauliflower. Celery and apple salad. 

Apple John. Coffee. 



Boiled Salted Salmon — Soak one pound of salted salmon all 
night. In the morning put in the skillet, with enough fresh wa- 
ter to cover, and boil about fifteen minutes. Drain and lay on 
hot platter. Over the fish lay bits of butter and dust with pepper. 

Muffins — Beat well together two eggs; add one cupful of milk 
and one-quarter spoonful of salt; pour over one heaping pint of 
sifted fiour and stir until smooth; add one tablespoonful of but- 
ter, melted, and beat hard until little bubbles can be seen in the 
batter. Stir in one heaping teaspoonful of baking powder, beat 
again for an instant and pour into hot, greased gem-pans, filling 
them two-thirds full. Bake twenty-five minutes in a quick oven. 

Welsh Rarebit — Scald one-quarter cup of milk. Stir into this 
when hot one cupful of grated cheese, with which has been mixed 
one-quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter spoonful of mus- 
tard (dry) and a dash of cayenne. When the cheese is melted 
add the well-beaten yolks of two eggs; stir and cook a minute, 
and pour over hot toast. In preparing a rarebit by this method 
a rich crumbly cheese should be used, as skimmed milk cheese 
will not melt, but remain in the liquid a tough mass. 

White Layer Cake — If this recipe is exactly followed the re- 
sult cannot but please: Half-cup butter, one and a half cups 
sugar (granulated), half-cup milk, two cups pastry flour (meas- 
ured before sifting), whites of six eggs and one teaspoonful bak- 
ing powder. Cream together sugar and butter; add the milk and 
beat together. Then add flour sifted five times. Beat well and 
add one-half teaspoonful each of lemon and vanilla, and six 
drops bitter almond. Then add stiffly-beaten whites of eggs and 
the baking powder. Bake in two layers. The oven should not be 
too hot when put in, to give cake time to rise. Hold hand in 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 401 

oven; if cool enough to count forty it is right. Fill and ice with 
plain boiled icing made by boiling one and a half cups of gran- 
ulated sugar and eight tablespoonfuls of hot water until it 
threads. Pour slowly over the beaten whites of two eggs, beat- 
ing continually until smooth and shiny. Both cake and icing 
should be cool when used. 

Baked Beefsteak Pie — Cut one pound of round steak in 
pieces about two inches square and brown in spider, carefully 
saving gravy; when turned once add one tablespoonful of butter. 
This must not be thoroughly cooked — just browned on outside. 
Parboil two potatoes, and when about half done cut in eighths. 
Put both meat and potatoes in pudding-pan and season with 
three-quarters of a teaspoonful of salt and one-quarter teaspoon- 
ful of pepper. Cover with crust made as follows: One cup sifted 
flour, one-quarter teaspoonful of salt and one heaping teaspoon- 
ful of baking powder. Into this rub one small tablespoonful of 
lard or butter. Moisten with milk until just soft enough to roll 
out, which usually requires about three-quarters of a teacupful 
of milk. Cut slits in top and bake twenty minutes. Sometimes 
I add a few dumplings made of the crust to the inside of the pie. 

Cauliflower — Soak the flower head down in salted water to 
drain out insects, if there be any. Rinse and put into boiling- 
salted water. In ten minutes pour off this water; add fresh salted 
boiling v/ater and boil from fifteen to twenty minutes longer. 
Make a drawn butter sauce thus: Rub together one tablespoon- 
ful of butter with one of flour until smooth. Season v/ith one- 
quarter teaspoonful of white pepper and one-half teaspoonful 
of salt; add to this one cup of milk and stir until it thickens; add 
one tablespoonful of lemon juice. Lay the unbroken head of 
cauliflower in vegetable dish and turn over the sauce, which 
should be just thick enough to pour. 

Celery and Apple Salad — Peel two apples and cut into large 
dice. Cut one stalk of celery into pieces the same size. Mix well 
and add a dressing made of the yolk of two eggs beaten thorough- 
ly, one level teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter spoonful of cayenne 
pepper, one of prepared mustard and one tablespoonful of but- 
ter. Stir into the mixture one-half cup of vinegar; stir with sil- 
ver or wooden spoon until thick. If too thick it may be thinned 
with a little sweet or sour cream. 

Apple John — One cup of sifted flour, one heaping teaspoon- 
ful of baking powder, one-quarter teaspoonful of salt, one table- 
spoonful of butter, half-cup of milk, one egg, well beaten, and 
one pint of apples, sliced. Sift together flour, baking powder 
and salt. Rub in butter, beat in egg and milk. This should be 
a thick, very thick batter. Put apples in deep pan and spread 
over them the batter. When baked reverse, cover with sugar, 
nutmeg and butter and serve with cream or with a cream sauce. 

Sauce— One large tablespoonful of butter, one cup of pulver- 
ized sugar, one teaspoonful of vanilla, one large cup of boiling 
water, one teaspoon, heaping full of flour. Beat butter, sugar 
and flavoring till very light and creamy. Put water in sauce-pan 



402 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

and add tlie flour, mixed in a little cold water. Cook this until 
like tiiin starch; add to butter and sugar mixture, beating brisk- 
ly and pouring gradually. If the beating is not stopped for a 
moment the whole sauce will rise and be very foamy.

Kentucky Fried Chicken — The chicken should always be 
dressed and kept in ice-box for at least twelve hours before 
using. Flour each piece and dust lightly with salt and pepper, 
use a level teaspoonful of salt and a quarter teaspoonful of pep- 
per in all. The frying-pan should be* half-full of lard and the 
latter smoking hot, when the chicken is put in. Then cover and 
cook slowly for one-half hour, turning from time to time. When 
done, pour the fat from the pan and add a tablespoonful of butter 
and let brown; then stir in a tablespoonful of flour, pour in a cup 
of milk, add a small saltspoonful of salt, and a pinch of pepper 
and let thicken. Serve gravy in a separate dish. Put little strips 
of fried pastry around the chicken. 

Broiled Egg Plant — Cut the egg plant in thick slices, care- 
fully paring each piece. Throw it in salt and water and let re- 
main three hours. Take from the water, drain and wipe. Then 
butter the slices of egg plant, dip in beaten egg, then in grated 
cracker and broil until a light brown. Dash pepper over them 
and serve. 

Peach Shortcake — Make a rich pastry. Roll thin and bake 
three crusts in pie-pans. Let them get thoroughly cold. Take

BREAKFAST. 

Baked pears. 

Frizzled beef. Bread and butter. 

Waffles, maple sirup. Coffee.

Veal loaf. Ripe cucumber pickles. 

Apple jelly. Tea. 



DINNER.

Coffee. 



Graham Bread — Two cups of buttermilk, half a cup of molas- 
ses, pinch of salt, one teaspoonful of saleratus; stir all well to- 
gether, add two, cups of wheat flour, scant half a cup of cornmeal 
and enough graham flour to make stiff. 

Veal Loaf — One pound of fresh veal, one-half pound of fresh 
pork, all chopped well. To this add two eggs, large tablespoonful 
of grated bread crumbs, half a cup of cream or milk, some chop- 
ped parsley, one good-sized onion, chopped fine, dash of red pep- 
per, and one level teaspoonful of salt; mix all thoroughly to- 
gether, and bake in deep breadpan, laying on top a bay leaf and 
one large slice of bacon. Bake half an hour. 

Ripe Cucumber Pickles — Take six large, ripe yellow cucum- 
bers, cut in halves, take out all the seeds and pulp; then cut in 
strips like your finger, stand over night in salt, so as to draw out 
the water from cucumbers. Take each strip next morning and 
wipe as dry as possible, placing them back in Jar as you do so. 
Have half a dozen red peppers prepared, by removing seeds, and 
cut in small, narrow pieces about an inch long; have also one 
fresh horseradish, prepared in same way, in small pieces, and 
about a pound of mustard seed; sprinkle all these in between 
the slices of cucumbers; have enough vinegar to cover same boil- 
ing hot, and pour over. On the third morning scald vinegar 



404 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

again, and they are then ready for use when cold. They can be 
put away in glass bottles on the third morning. 

Apple Jelly — Take large, ripe cooking apples, put small 
amount of water on same; after all are well cooked remove from 
stove and place in cheese-cloth bag, made three-cornered shape, 
with the long point down, put jelly in this and let drip. When 
all the juice has been extracted, measure, and to one glass of 
juice add three-fourths of a glass of sugar. If you want good 
success with jelly never cook more than three or four glasses at 
a time. Cook all jellies, v/hen water has been added, longer than 
when it has not. This jelly to be cooked about ten to fifteen 
minutes; then have glasses ready; in each glass put a nice, large 
fresh rose geranium leaf; pour hot jelly on same. The leaf will 
turn yellow and come to the top, and it then can be removed. 
The flavor of this jelly is indescribable. It is a very fine way for 
flavoring cake dough, when out of extract, by placing leaf bottom 
of cakepan and then pouring dough over same. 

Tea — Have pot good and hot hy pouring hot water in same and 
letting stand until the water in tea kettle is boiling; always have 
fresh water in tea kettle and never let it boil any time before 
making tea; keep a whole vanilla bean in tea canister; this gives 
a nice flavor to same. One can put a piece about an inch long 
in tea while steeping if it is liked. 

Horseradish Sauce — Take the fresh horseradish, grate about 
one-half cup; to this add two rolled crackers, one-half teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a teaspoonful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of vine- 
gar and a large cup of the soup taken from beef; stir all well 
together, adding crackers and horseradish last, for the longer you 
boil horseradish the weaker it grows. 

Boiled Potatoes — Always put potatoes into boiling water with 
quite a little salt; when done pour off all the water, and then 
shake over fire until they become mealy and dry.

Popovers. Coffee. 



LUNCHEON. 

Eggs a la creme. 

Thinly sliced bread and butter. 

Frozen meringue. Dover cake. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 405 

DINNER. 

Soup crecy. 

Timbaie of beef. 

Buttered parsnips. Potato salad. 

Fruit pudding. 

Coffee. 



Grapes — Some one has said that the art of breakfasting right- 
ly is one of the distinguishing marks of higher civilization. Noth- 
ing is more conducive to this end than a well-set table and dainti- 
ly served dishes. The bunches of grapes should be dipped in 
ice water and drained quite dry before serving. This fruit looks 
nicer on delicate, light china and a few leaves in the fruit dish 
will add much to the effect. 

Liver Cutlets — Buy half a pound of liver and have it sliced 
thin; scald it, then wipe dry. Beat the yolk of one egg, dip the 
slices in it, then in cracker or bread crumbs. Sprinkle with one- 
quarter teaspoon of salt and one-eighth teaspoon pepper. Fry 
in bacon drippings and serve on a hot platter. Save the white of 
the egg for your meringue. 

Eggs a la Creme — This dish calls for five hard boiled eggs, 
about two cups of bread crumbs, one cup of milk, one-half table- 
spoon of butter, three-quarters of a teaspoon of salt and a 
quarter-teaspoon of pepper. Scatter bread crumbs over 
the bottom of a baking dish, lay on the eggs sliced 
in thin rings, sprinkle with salt and pepper and bits of butter. 
Continue thus to blend these ingredients until the dish is near- 
ly full. Have the top layer crumbs, then pour the milk over the 
whole mixture and bake in a moderately heated oven. 

Frozen Meringue — Apples are so cheap we all can enjoy this 
delightful cream. If the day should prove cool, it will be quite 
good without freezing. To make apple meringue or cream, take 
one pint of thick stewed apples, press through a sieve, add one- 
half cup of sugar, and flavor with nutmeg. Stir in the stiffly 
beaten whites of two eggs and beat until light and foarny. Add 
one-half pint of milk, or cream if you have it, and freeze. 

Dover Cake — This recipe makes a cake as delicate as the 
most excellent pound cake and less expensive. One-fourth cup 
of butter, one-half cup of sugar, one cup of flour, one-fourth cup 
of sweet milk, two eggs, one level teaspoon of baking powder and 
one-half teaspoon of rose-water or rind and juice of half a lem- 
on. Cream the butter and sugar, mix with them the yolks whip- 
ped light, then the milk and flour sifted with the baking pow- 
der. Add the rose-water, and lastly, the beaten whites of the 
eggs. Stir all well and bake in a loaf, using a small square or 
oblong baking pan. This cake should be made the day before. 

Soup Crecy — Many persons do not realize how helpful soups 
are to economical living; now vegetables are so plentiful and 
cheap, the best of soup may be made with very little expense. 
Take two good-sized carrots, one potato, and one turnip. Pare 



406 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

the vegetables and cut in small dice. Boil in one quart of water 
until tender; rub through a sieve and return the paste to the wa- 
ter. Add one tablespoon of chopped onion, one-half saltspoon 
of celery salt, one large saltspoon of salt, one-half saltspoon of 
pepper, one-half tablespoon of butter, and one cup of milk. Let 
this boil for five minutes. Mix smoothly one tablespoon of flour 
v/ith a little cold water; add to the soup, and stir until it thick- 
ens. Serve with croutons. 

Timbale of Beef — Chop fine about one pint of cold cooked 
beef, free from fat and gristle; add to it one-half cup of cracker 
or bread crumbs, one large half-teaspoon of salt, one-quarter tea- 
spoon of pepper, and one-half teaspoon of onion juice. Heat 
two-thirds of a cup of stock or milk; add it to the meat, with one 
tablespoon of melted butter and the yolk of one egg. (Use the 
yolk left from the meringue.) Mix thoroughly, and put in a well- 
greased mold or bowl, and set in a pan of hot water; cover with 
a greased paper, and bake about one hour in a moderate oven. 
Turn out on a hot platter and serve with brov/n sauce if liked. 

Potato Salad — Pare and boil five medium-sized potatoes. 
When done, drain and press through a coarse sieve. While hot 
stir in one tablespoon of butter, one finely chopped onion and 
one-half teaspoon of salt. Beat until light. Take the pounded 
yellow of two hard-boiled eggs. Mix with it one-quarter teaspoon 
of pepper, the same of mustard and celery salt; beat in gradually 
one-quarter cup of vinegar. Mix this thoroughly with the pota- 
toes, then add the finely chopped whites of the eggs. Set on ice 
until ready to serve and heap lightly in a pretty salad bowl. 
This is a much more digestible salad than when made in the 
usual way with chopped potatoes. 

Fruit Pudding — One pint of flour; one heaping tablespoon 
of lard, one-half teaspoon of soda, dissolved in a little hot water, 
one teaspoon cream of tartar, sifted through the flour; one salt- 
spoon of salt; cold water enough to make into a tolerably stiff 
paste; one pint of sliced peaches. Roll out the crust about a 
quarter of an inch thick into an oblong sheet. Cover thickly 
with the peaches and sprinkle with sugar. Begin at one end, 
and roll it up closely, the fruit inside. In putting this in, leave 
a narrow margin at the other end of the roll, which should be 
folded down closely. Pinch the ends of the folded roll together, 
to prevent the escape of the fruit. Tie up in a floured cloth and 
boil three-quarters of an hour. Serve hot with sauce. This is 
a cheap but good pudding, better than many a richer one.

LUNCHEON. 

Codfish salad. 

Bread and butter. Baked bananas. 

Almond cake. Tea. 



DINNER. 

Onion and cucumber soup. 

Vealettes. Mashed potatoes. 

Egg plant baked with cheese. 

Peach water ice. Coffee. 



Baked Pears — Pare and core five large, sweet pears without 
dividing; place them in a baking dish and fill each pear with a 
teaspoonful of sugar; add a little water and bake until perfectly 
tender. Serve with sweet cream. 

Meat Gems — Remove all pieces of fat, bone and gristle from 
cold roast beef or pork that is verj'^ lean, and chop fine or put it 
through a meat cutter. To one large cup of the chopped meat 
add an equal quantity of bread crumbs, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a saltspoonful of pepper and a teaspoonful of butter; moisten 
with half a cup of milk and heat thoroughly. Then fill gem pans 
nearly full with the mixture; break an egg on the top of each 
and bake until the egg is cooked. 

Hygienic Muffins — Grease the muffin rings and put them in 
an oven to get very hot. Put two cups of ice-water and one tea- 
spoonful of salt into a large bowl; take three and one-half cups 
of graham flour; take it up by handfuls, holding it high over the 
bowl, which should stand in a current of air, and sprinkle slowly 
into the ice-water, beating all the while; then pour into the very 
hot rings, put at once into a very hot oven and bake about thirty- 
five minutes. 

Codfish Salad — Salt codfish salad is very nice for luncheon in 
hot weather. Soak about a pound of fish over night, boil and set 
av/ay to become cold; just before serving time flake the fish, re- 
moving all the bones and skin; arrange on a bed of tender let- 
tuce and pour over a mayonnaise dressing. 

Baked Bananas — Strip off one-third of the skin of each ba- 
nana, and with a spoon loosen the remainder from the fruit; ar- 
range in a baking dish the stripped sides uppermost; on each lay 
one-half of a teaspoonful of butter in bits and sprinkle with one 
teaspoonful of sugar and one-half of a teaspoonful of lemon 
juice. Bake twenty minutes in a hot oven. The bananas may 
be entirely stripped, if desired, but the skin contains considerable 
pectin, which it is well to have. 

Almond Cake — Cream one-half cup of butter, add gradually 
one cup of sugar and one small half-teaspoonful of almond ex- 
tract; mix and sift one cup of flour, one-half a cup of cornstarch 
and one level teaspoonful of baking powder; add alternately with 
one-half cup of milk to the first mixture; beat the whites of three 
eggs until stiff; add and stir in carefully. Bake in a moderate 
oven. 



408 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Onion and Cucumber Soup — Peel and cut in thin slices, cross- 
wise, two good-sized onions and three cucumbers; cover with one 
pint of boiling water and one pint of veal or chicken stock, and 
simmer very slowly for one hour; then rub through a sieve, press- 
ing hard, so as to obtain as much of the pulp as possible; re- 
turn to the fire and keep hot. In a double boiler scald one pint 
of milk and stir into it one tablespoonful of butter and two of 
flour rubbed together to a paste; when thick and smooth, add 
to the strained soup; season with a large teaspoonful of salt, a 
saltspoonful of pepper; simmer for five minutes, and serve with 
croutons. 

Vealettes — Purchase veal cut from the leg, in slices as large 
as one's hand, and about half an inch thick. On each slice lay 
a large tablespoonful of dressing, made from a cup of bread 
crumbs, a beaten egg, a tablespoonful of butter, half a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, a good dash of pepper, a tablespoonful of sage and 
summer savory mixed. Roll up the slices, pinning with wooden 
toothpicks to keep the dressing in. Put a little butter and water 
in a baking pan with the veal and bake in a hot oven three-quar- 
ters of an hour. Baste often, and when done thicken the gravy, 
pour over the veal and serve on hot platter, with thin slices of 
lemon. 

Egg Plant Baked with Cheese — Place tv/o egg plants in a 
bowl, pour boiling water over them, cover and let stand ten min- 
utes. Then peel and slice one-quarter of an inch in thickness. 
Divide each slice in four, season with one small saltspoon of pep- 
per and one level teaspoonful of salt and fry in a little butter or 
fresh-rendered suet over a quick fire, placing them on a hot pan 
when cooked. Melt one tablespoonful of butter and one of 
flour, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of cayenne 
In a saucepan; add one-half of a cup of stock and one of milk; 
stir until thick and smooth, and simmer five minutes. Arrange 
the slices of egg plant in a greased baking dish, putting a spoon- 
ful of the sauce and a sprinkle of grated cheese between each 
layer. Put one teaspoonful of butter in bits over the top and 
bake twenty minutes in a moderate even. 

Peach Water Ice — Cut eight good-sized very ripe peaches in 
pieces. Mash them and add one cup of sugar; then add the 
juice of three lemons, mixed v/itli half of a cup of sugar. Let 
stand twenty minutes. Add one quart of water, beat, strain and 
freeze. Marion Wilson.

Meat Omelets — One cup cold beef, or veal, finely chopped, one 
cup bread crumbs soaked in one cup of milk, two eggs, salt, pep- 
per, and if veal is used a small pinch of sage or marjoram. Mix 
thoroughly, having the bread soft and fine. Add last the beaten 
eggs, and drop by the spoonful into hot beef drippings, and fry 
a delicate brown. 

Stuffed Potatoes — Select six potatoes of even size. Cut a 
thin slice from one end, that they may stand firm, and put in the 
oven to bake. As soon as thoroughly done remove from the oven, 
and with sharp scissors cut a lid from the upper end and scoop 
out the potato into a hot bowl with a teaspoon, keeping the skin 
quite whole. Point the edge of the skin with the scissors. Beat 
the potato in the bowl quite light with two teaspoonfuls of cream, 
a teaspoonful of butter and the beaten white of one egg. Salt. 
Then fill the skins with the mixture, heaping it high on top. 
Set the potatoes carefully on end and return to oven for ten min- 
utes to heat. Serve on a platter with sprigs of parsley. 

Veal Broth — Take a knuckle of veal costing 15 cents and put 
it in a sauce-pan with a closely fitting cover. Add three pints of 
cold water and a teaspoonful of salt, and set it where it will boil 
very gently three hours before dinner. After two hours add a 
small onion, two tablespoonfuls of rice and a stalk of celery or 
a little celery seed, and a saltspoonful of pepper. Remove the 
meat before serving, but leave the rice. This is a simple and de- 
licious soup. 

Braised Lamb — Take a fore-quarter of lamb weighing five 
or six pounds, and have the butcher remove the shoulder blade. 
Put into your braising-pan one spoonful of butter or beef drip- 
pings. Add one onion, sliced, and half a small turnip. Brown 
these well and then draw the vegetables to one side and lay in 
the lamb, dredging it with fiour. Brown on one side. Then turn 
and brown the other. Then add one pint of water, a bouquet 
of sweet herbs and sprinkle with a heaping teaspoonful of salt 
and a saltspoonful of pepper. Cover the pan perfectly close and 
cook one hour and a half in a moderate oven. Dish the meat, 



410 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

thicken the gravy with a spoonful of flour rubbed smooth in a 
■very little water, let it boil up on top of the stove, then strain 
over the meat. 

Succotash — One dozen ears green corn, one pint shelled lima 
beans, butter the size of an egg, salt and pepper. Cut the corn 
from the cobs, scoring through each row if the corn be large. 
Scrape lightly with the back of the knife, and put beans and cobs 
on to boil an hour before dinner, with not quite a quart of water. 
Twenty minutes before serving remove the cobs and part of the 
water. Add the cut corn and boil very gently that it may not 
burn. Add the butter, a saltspoonful of pepper and a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and dish. The water should be evaporated by the time 
the corn is done. 

Steamed Blueberry Pudding — One pint of flour, one pint of 
berries, washed and drained in a sieve; two slightly heaping tea- 
spoonfuls of cream of tartar, one level teaspoonful of soda, one- 
half teaspoonful of salt, milk to mix — about one cup. Sift the 
soda, cream of tartar and salt into the flour and stir well, then 
add the berries and just enough milk to mix the whole to a stiff 
batter. Put in a well-buttered tin mold or pail, which set into a 
sauce-pan half-filled with boiling water. The saucepan must 
have a tightly fitting cover. Let cook for one hour and a half, 
and serve with a hot sauce. 

Sauce — Cream half a teacup of butter; add one cup of sugar 
and two teaspoonfuls of flour. Beat well. Pour on one teacup 
of boiling water. Let boil for two minutes and flavor with nut- 
meg or vanilla if preferred. This is a very excellent pudding and 
also very inexpensive. Catherine Forest.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOCK. 411 

Dropped Eggs — Have one quart of boiling water and one 
tablespoonful of salt in a frying pan. Break five eggs, one by 
one, into a saucer and slide carefully into the salted water. Cook 
until the white is firm, and lift out with a griddle-cake turner, 
and place each egg on a half slice of hot-buttered toast. 

Potato Fritters — One pint of boiled and mashed potatoes, one- 
half cupful of hot milk, three tablespoonfuls of butter, two eggs, 
one-half teaspoonful of salt. Add the milk, butter and salt to the 
mashed potatoes, and then add the eggs, well beaten. Stir until" 
very smooth and light. Spread about one inch thick on a but- 
tered dish, and set away to cool. When cold cut in squares. Dip 
in beaten egg and in bread crumbs, and fry brown in boiling fat. 
Serve at once. 

Quick Coffee Bread — One quart of flour, one level teaspoon- 
ful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, five eggs well 
beaten with two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one pint of milk, and two 
tablespoonfuls of softened butter. Beat well, spread in a pan 
and sprinkle sugar, a little cinnamon and bits of butter on top, 
and bake in a quick oven. 

Welsh Rarebit — Half a pound of fresh cheese, two eggs, one- 
quarter saltspoonful cayenne, one tablespoonful of butter, one 
teaspoonful of mustard, half a teaspoonful of salt, one-half cup 
cream. Break the cheese in small pieces, and put it and the 
other ingredients in a light sauce-pan, which put over boiling wa- 
ter. Stir until the cheese melts; then spread the mixture on 
slices of hot crisp toast. Serve at once. Water may be used in- 
stead of cream. 

Cucumber Salad — Cut about one inch off the point of the cu- 
cumber and pare. (The bitter juice is in the point, and if this 
is not cut off before paring the knife carries the flavor all 
through the cucumber.) Cut in thin slices, cover with cold wa- 
ter and let stand one-half hour. Drain and season with French 
dressing. 

French Dressing — Three tablespoonfuls of butter, one of 
vinegar, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half a saltspoonful of pep- 
per. Put the salt and pepper in a cup and add one tablespoonful 
of the butter, when thoroughly mixed add remainder of butter 
and vinegar. 

Minced Cabbage — Drain boiled cabbage in a colander. Put 
it in the chopping tray and chop fine. For one quart of chopped 
cabbage put two tablespoonfuls of butter and one of flour in the 
frying pan. As soon as smooth and hot put in the cabbage, and 
season with one teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoonful of pepper 
and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Stir constantly for five min- 
utes. When done heap on a dish. Make smooth with a knife 
and garnish with hard-boiled eggs. 

Peach Sponge — One pint of pared peaches, one-half 
package of gelatine, the whites of five eggs, one scant cup of 
sugar, one and one-half cups of water. Soak the gelatine for two 
hours in one-half cup of water. Boil the cup of water and sugar 
fifteen minutes. Mash the peaches fine, rub through a sieve and 



412 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

put in the sirup. Cook five minutes, stirring all the time. Place 
the sauce pan in another of boiling water and add the gelatine. 
Stir for five minutes to dissolve the gelatine; then place the sauce 
pan in a dish of ice water and beat the sirup until it cools. Add 
the beaten whites of the eggs and beat until it begins to thicken. 
When it will just pour turn it into the mold and set away to 
harden. Serve with sugar and cream. Mrs. Byron Backus.

DINNER. 

Mutton chops. Mashed potatoes. 

Green corn. Entire wheat bread. Pickled onions.

Fried Brains — After leaving a pound and a half of brains 
in salt and water for an hour, remove the membrane which 
covers them, put them over the fire in cold water enough to cover 
them, add a slice of carrot, turnip and onion, a sprig of parsley 
and thyme, a teaspoonful of salt, a gill of vinegar and boil them 
fifteen minutes. Take them up and dry on a clean cloth. In the 
morning dip in bread crumbs and beaten egg and fry in smoking 
hot fat. Put on a hot dish with tomato sauce under them and 
garnish with parsley. 

Pried Scallops — One of the simplest ways of cooking the scal- 
lop is to fry it. Drain the liquor from the scallops thoroughly, 
laying them in a sieve; immerse them in milk, season with a lit- 
tle salt and pepper and roll in fine cracker crumbs, being careful 
to cover them thoroughly. As they are breaded, put them into 
a frying basket and plunge them into boiling hot fat. Fry them 
about four minutes, drain and slip them on brown paper to ab- 
sorb any extraneous fat. Then serve on a napkin on a hot plat- 
ter with delicately thin, hot, buttered slices of brown bread. Mix 
about a quarter of a cup of fiour with every cupful of sifted crack- 
er crumbs used in breading. 

Entire Wheat Bread— Two cupfuls of entire wheat fiour, one 
cupful of cornmeal, two-thirds cupful of molasses, one large cup- 



TBfE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOIC 41S 

ful of sweet milk^ one cupful of sour milk, two-thirds of a tea- 
spoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of soda. Steam three hours and 
bake one hour. 

Pickled Onions — Choose small onions of equal size, perfectly 
sound; peel them without breaking off the tops and roots so 
closely as to cause them to break apart; soak them for tv^^enty- 
four hours in strongly salted cold water; drain and dry each on 
a cloth before putting them into glass jars; heat to boiling point 
sufficient vinegar to cover them, scalding with it mixed whole 
cloves, mace and peppercorns; cool the vinegar and pour it over 
the onions, distributing the spices among the jars. The second 
and third days pour off the vinegar, scald it and return it to 
the jars, after it has become cool. On the third day seal the jars 
air-tight, after pouring the vinegar over the onions,

DINNER.

Ham Omelet — This may be baked, or cooked on top of the 
stove in a skillet; be sure, however, to grease the latter well. 
Mince two full tablespoons of ham, with a tiny slice of garlic. 
If latter is not relished, a teaspoonful of chopped parsley may be 
substituted. Beat six eggs separately; mix the ham with its rel- 
ish into the yolks. Take a teacup of milk, thicken with a table- 
spoonful of flour; let it come to a boil; add one tablespoonful 
of butter, and saltspoonful of salt. Let this cool somewhat, then 
stir in yolks which have been mixed with the ham; lastly add 
the frothy vv^hites, stirring very lightly with a knifebiade. Have 
quick oven; serve very hot. Bake about ten minutes. 

Potato Biscuit — Warm half cup of milk — enough to melt two 
tablespoonfuls of butter. Stir into it a pint of hot mashed po- 



414 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

tatoes, seasoned with teaspoonful of salt, two dashes of white 
pepper, two eggs beaten together; sift in enough flour to handle; 
lay on biscuit board, roll lightly into thickness of an inch; cut 
out with cooky-cutter; bake in moderate oven about twenty 
minutes. Can be baked in jelly-cake pans, and cut in pie-shape 
pieces, if preferred. Then I would suggest splitting and butter- 
ing before sending to table. 

Cafe au Lait — Either drip or boiled coffee may be used for 
this. Heat unskimmed milk to the boiling point; sweeten, add 
to the coffee twenty minutes before serving. Whatever of this 
is left it is customary among the Creoles to put into a jug of 
earthenware and allow to boil up for ten minutes, then cork 
tightly and put aside in a cool place to be used as drink in the 
evening or later in the day. Indeed, it is expected enough will 
be made in the morning to allow of this provision. It may be 
slightly less strong than when drank hot for breakfast; but 
treated in this way it has a rich, creamy taste, with a flavor all 
its own. 

Use a full pint of unskimmed milk in proportion to a quart of 
coffee, and heat the milk to a boiling point before combining 
them. Sweeten with three or four tablespoonfuls of sugar, ac- 
cording to taste. Drip coffee is made in proportion of one table- 
spoonful of powdered coffee (that is ground very fine) to each 
person, and one full coffeecup of boiling water to each person. 
French coffeepots are sold everywhere now. Put coffee in the 
receptacle, pour the boiling water upon it. In a few moments 
the clear liquid will be ready to drink. If desired stronger, pass 
the liquid through twice. This can so gracefully be done by the 
mistress at the table. Be sure to have water actually boiling 
when using. The bubbles should rise from the bottom to the 
surface of the water. 

Creole Kedgeree — Any kind of cold fresh fish can be used for 
this appetizing, inexpensive dish. To one cupful of cold trout, 
salmon or whitefish, left from yesterday, from which all the bones 
have been taken, add cupful of cold boiled rice, one tablespoon- 
ful of butter, teaspoonful of salt, a dash of cayenne, a very hard- 
boiled egg, chopped fine, a slice or so of garlic, or onion, or one 
full tablespoon curry powder, if preferred. Drop these into a 
hot skillet; as the butter melts, stir the ingredients well togeth- 
er. It is not intended to fry them, only to thoroughly heat and 
blend them — five minutes will be enough. Serve on squares of 
hot, buttered toast, or slices of buttered bread. If curry powder 
is not the East India article, a little lemon juice may be added. 

Cucumber Jelly — This is especially nice to serve with any 
fish, or it makes a good salad course served with lettuce leaves, 
which have French dressing upon them. Pare four large cu- 
cumbers, not too ripe. Cut up and stew in one quart of water 
with a small onion, full teaspoon salt, one-half teaspoon white 
pepper. Soak meanwhile half box gelatine in teacup cold water. 
When cucumbers are perfectly soft stir in the gelatine until it 
is fully dissolved. Then strain so as to avoid the seeds. When 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 415 

almost cold peel and slice very thin one cucumber; line the mold, 
which has been wet with cold water, with it; pour in the liquid 
jelly; allow to "set" very firmly. If served on platter upon 
lettuce leaves pour the French dressing over the mold as well 
as leaves. French dressing is made in proportion of two table- 
spoons of salad oil to one of vinegar, with half-teaspoon salt. 

Florendines, or Fruit Tarts — Can be made of any fruit, stewed 
if possible in its own juice or with as little water as possible; 
sweeten well after cooking. Line small crimped pans with puff 
paste or rich pie crust and bake them. While still warm drop 
in the fruit and return to the oven for ten minutes. 

Beef Gumbo — Cut up one and one-half pounds lean beef into 
small bits; season with full teaspoon pepper, two teaspoons 
salt. Slice in one large onion, one potato, three or four large 
tomatoes, about sixteen fresh, young, small ochras. Cover well 
with about a quart cold water. Allow it to boil very slowly, 
cover fitting tightly, until everything is like pulp or rags. Then 
put through the colander. Toast four slices of bread, cut in 
quarter slices, or dry stale bread in oven, and break into frag- 
ments; put them in bottom of tureen or deep vegetable dish and 
pour the gumbo over. 

Sweet Potatoes a la Creole — Scrape six large sweet potatoes; 
cut in halves the long way. Put in deep baking dish, cover with 
milk, add half-teaspoon salt and tablespoon butter. Wet half- 
teacup of bread crumbs with one egg lightly beaten; cover the 
potatoes with these and bake in moderate oven about an hour. 

Pineapple Sherbet — Boil one quart of water and a pound of 
sugar for fifteen minutes, so that a thick sirup is made. Pare 
carefully and finely shred a pineapple two hours before using. 
Cut out the core, so that almost all fruit can be used. Sprinkle 
with two tablespoons sugar; cover well. Allow the 
fruit, juice and shreds to infuse in the warm sirup until entirely 
cold — an hour, if convenient. Put in freezer; when the little 
crystals begin to form on sides stir in the well-beaten whites of 
three eggs and return to freezer, shaking as usual.

egg and then into cracker crumbs. Put one tablespoonful of but- 
ter and one of suet into a frying-pan and brown the cutlets on 
both sides. Make a brov/n sauce in the pan; pour over the 
squares and serve. 

Breakfast Potatoes — Slice evenly five or six cold boiled pota- 
toes. Cut two small onions in slices, and put them with four 
ounces of butter into a frying-pan. When the onions are colored 
slightly add the potatoes; sprinkle with a half-teaspoonful of salt; 
toss them in the pan until they are a good color; drain and serve 
with chopped parsley (one teaspoonful) sprinkled over them. 

Southern Corn-Pone — Take one quart of white cornmeal. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 417 

Pour over it just enough boiling water to scald it through. Stir 
thoroughly and let stand until cold. Rub into it a piece of but- 
ter the size of an egg and a teaspoonfui of salt. Beat two eggs 
until light; add them to the meal; mix well; add one pint sour 
milk or buttermilk, a teaspoonfui of soda dissolved in a table- 
spoonful of hot water, and beat until smooth. Turn into a 
greased tin and bake thirty-five minutes in a quick oven. 

Boston Brov\^n Hash — Chop up the remains of either cold 
beef or mutton to the amount of two cupfuls or less. Take the 
same quantity of cold mashed potatoes; half a cup of bread 
crumbs and a tablespoonful of butter. (If the pota- 
toes and meat have been properly seasoned when cooked no 
salt will be required.) Into a deep dish put a layer 
of the potatoes, then one of meat, then the crumbs. Add the 
butter in small bits; moisten with one-half cup of gravy; put a 
layer of potatoes on top. Dip a knife in milk, smooth over the 
top, dust lightly with pepper and bake until brown. 

Green-Grape Jelly — Take grapes that are just beginning to 
turn. Wash in cold water after first picking them from the 
stems. Add one cup of vv^ater to eight pounds of the fruit. Stew 
until soft. Mash and strain without squeezing through a cheese- 
cloth bag. Return to fire, let come to a boil and skin. To every 
cup of juice add a cup of heated sugar; boil twenty minutes; pour 
into glasses. Y/hen cold, seal. 

Levigne Soup — Cut two carrots and a small onion into small, 
thin pieces, and cook until tender in salted v/ater. Vv/'hen done, 
drain, and add them to three pints of boiling stock free from 
grease. Beat together the yolks of four eggs and one-half gill 
of cream. Add a scant teaspoonfui of salt and half a saltspoon- 
ful of pepper to the soup. Remove from the fire, stir in the eggs 
and serve. 

Steak with Bananas — Broil a sirloin steak, place on a hot 
platter, spread both sides with a tablespoonful of melted butter, 
mixed with one teaspoonfui of salt, one-fourth as much white 
pepper; over this sprinkle one tablespoonful of grated horse- 
radish. Pare three bananas and split lengthwise, fry brown in 
butter and lay them over the hot steak. 

Baked Potatoes Creamed — Bake eight good-sized pota^toes 
one-half hour in a hot oven; scoop out the inside; beat at once, 
with one-half cup of hot milk, a tablespoonful of melted butter 
and a teaspoonfui of salt. Heap on a plate, touch lightly Vvitli 
yolk of an egg, brov/n in quick oven and serve. 

Apple Flipflaps — Butter gem-pans and half fill them with 
rich biscuit dough. Pare, core and slice tart, juicy apples, and 
fill gem-pans; placing apples on top of the dough. Cover with

Frizzled Beef — Chip dried beef very thin. To a half-pound 
allow a large tablespoonful of butter, a half-pint of milk and one 
tablespoonful of flour. Melt the butter in a frying-pan, then add 
the meat, and stir over the fire for about two minutes, or until the 
butter begins to brown; dredge in the flour; stir again; then 
add the milk, and a little pepper; stir again until it boils, and 
serve immediately. 

Potato Cakes — These may be made from cold mashed potatoes 
left from yesterday's dinner. If the potatoes be dry or hard, add 
a little milk and beat with a fork until light. Form into flat 
cakes, not too large, and fry in very hot lard. They may be dipped 
into beaten egg and cornmeal or flour before frying. 

Southern Cornbread — One and one-half cups of white corn- 
meal, half a cup of flour, two teaspoonfuls of sugar, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, one heaping teaspoonful of baking-powder, two 
teaspoonfuls lard, one and one-half cups of milk and two eggs. 
Sift the flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt and baking-powder; rub in 
the lard cold, add the eggs, well-beaten, and then the milk. Mix 
into a moderately stiff batter; pour it into well-greased, shallow 
baking-pans (pie tins are suitable). Bake from thirty to forty 
minutes. 

Velvet Sponge Cake — Two cups of sugar, two cups of flour, 
four eggs, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, three-quarters of a 
cup of hot water, grated rind of lemon. Stir together until creamy, 
the sugar and the yolks of the eggs; add the flour and baking 
powder. Then add the hot water; stir well until smooth and not 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 419 

lumpy. Next add the well-beaten whites. Do not have them cur- 
dled, but stiff. Flavor. The batter may seem too thin, but will 
prove all right, and you may bake it as you would any other 
sponge cake. 

Brunswick Stew — Cut a four-pound chicken into pieces, as for 
a fricassee. Put it in a large covered saucepan with a small onion, 
sliced, and a quarter of a pound of bacon, in one piece (a ham 
bone is better than the bacon). Cover with boiling water and 
simmer gently for one and a half hours. Then add one pint of 
very tender Lima beans, one pint of corn, cut from the cob, one 
tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one-half teaspoonful of salt 
(this seasons the vegetables) and one quarter teaspoonful of pep- 
per. Cover again and simmer one hour longer. Remove the lump 
of bacon and serve. Care must be taken not to scorch this stew. 
Keep it over a very moderate fire, and stir frequently from the 
bottom of the saucepan. 

Peach Cobbler — Line a two-quart pudding dish with a thick 
crust. Peel and cut into quarters peaches enough to fill the dish, 
heaping them. Cover with a teacupful of sugar, a half teaspoon- 
ful of ground cinnamon and the juice of half a lemon. Cover the 
dish with a thick, rich pie crust, put the dish in the oven, and 
bake very slowly until the crust is a rich dark brown. When 
it is baked take a silver spoon and break the top crust into pieces, 
letting some of them mix with the fruit. This "pie" may be served 
either hot or cold, but it is better cold with whipped cream.

Green Corn Griddle Cakes — Run a knife through the center 
of the grains, then with the knife scrape out all you can. (If you 
have a corn grater so much the better.) To twelve ears add the 
yolks of two eggs, a level teaspoon of salt, one tablespoon of 
melted butter (no flour). Beat the whites very light, add one or 
two more whites if you have them; grease the griddle with butter; 
mix a little of the white with the batter each time you fill the 
griddle; drop on in small cakes — large ones will not turn. When 
they look dry around the edge turn with a broad knife. They are 
very delicate. Mrs. A. M. Finley.

celery cut into small pieces. Put celery to boil in just enough 
water to cover. Make pint of cream sauce by taking two table-

also one well-beaten egg just before serving. Pour over slices of 
hot buttered toast and serve. 

Curry of Eggs — Boil six eggs thirty minutes; when cold, peel 
and cut into quarters; make a sauce by frying one heaping table- 
spoonful of sliced onion in one tablespoonful of butter; take the 
onion out and to butter add one heaping tablespoonful of flour 
and half ditto of curry powder, one and one-half cups white 
stock or milk, one-half teaspoonful of salt and three dashes of- 
pepper; add eggs and onion; put in oval dish and cover with but- 
tered bread crumbs; bake a light brown. 

Boiled Rice — Wash one heaping cup of rice thoroughly, throw 
it into one quart of boiling water, with half-teaspoonful salt and 
let boil hard for twenty minutes, draw to back of stove and let 
the rice dry off: Do not stir while cooking.

422 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

sugar, add two tablespoonfuls of milk and three well-beaten 
eggs, add grated half of lemon and half-teaspoonful cinnamon 
and nutmeg mixed. Mix one heaping teaspoonful of baking 
powder with three cups of flour, and beat well with the other 
ingredients; add two cups of flour to roll out, roll half an inch 
thick, cut in strips, roll in coarse granulated sugar and fold to 
form a circle; bake a delicate brown. Enough for several meals. 

Broiled Beef Tenderloin — One pound and a half tenderloin 
steak, cut into inch-thick slices, broil over a brisk fire a few 
moments, or until the juice begins to run; have ready a pint of 
Mexican sauce, pour over the steak and serve at once. 

Mexican Sauce--.Cut a good-sized onion into thin slices; fry 
a delicate brown in a heaping tablespoonful of butter; then add 
two large tomatoes, peeled and sliced thin, one red pepper and 
one green pepper chopped fine; leave the seeds in; let simmer 
until tender; then add a clove of garlic cut fine, half-teaspoon of 
celery salt, quarter-teaspoon black pepper and one teaspoon of 
Worcestershire sauce. 

Sweet and Irish Potatoes Saute — Cut into inch pieces enough 
cold baked or boiled sweet potatoes to make one pint; ditto 
Irish potatoes; season with half-teaspoonful salt, quarter-tea- 
spoonful pepper and fry all together in a skillet containing a gen- 
erous quantity of very hot beef dripping and butter. Fry a deli- 
cate brown. 

Corn Fritters — To one pint of corn pulp add two well-beaten 
eggs, one-quarter cup milk, half- teaspoon salt, ditto pepper; fry 
in thin cakes on hot buttered griddle. 

Peach Snowballs — Select twelve ripe, good-sized freestone 
peaches; pare and roll in powdered sugar; stick a small silver 
berry fork in each one; then dip into soft icing, being careful 
to cover the peach entirely; let dry a few minutes, then roll in 
freshly grated cocoanut. A pretty effect is obtained by coloring 
the icing a soft pink. Canned peaches may be used in winter.

DINNER. 

Lobster soup. 
Steamed fowl. Celery sauce. 

Rice potatoes. Corn fritters. 

Frozen peaches. Maccaroons. 

Coffee. 



Delicate Omelette — This is best made in a chafing dish at the 
table. Take one tablespoonful of butter and one of chopped pars- 
ley. Heat together in the chafing dish. Then add five well- 
beaten eggs, mixed with a scant teacup of milk, a saltspoon of 
salt, and half as much pepper. Stir slowly from the bottom of 
the tin until it is of a smooth, fine consistency. This is delicious 
and much more delicate than scrambled eggs. 

Coffee — Allow one tablespoonful of ground coffee for each per- 
son. Have the water boiling and the coffee pot hot. Grind the 
coffee fresh every morning. When convenient, it is better to 
make it at the breakfast table, using a Marion Harland or a 
French coffee pot. 

Lobster a la Newberg — Take the meat of a large lobster, one 
weighing nearly two pounds; cut in small slices, and put into a 
chafing dish with one tablespoonful of butter, a saltspoon of salt 
and half a saltspoon of red pepper. Add one-half pint of milk. 
Let boil ten minutes, then add three well-beaten eggs and a gill 
of rich cream. Let all come to a boil and serve immediately. 

Warm Gingerbread — One cup molasses, one teaspoonful soda, 
one tablespoonful ginger, one-half teaspoon salt, one third cup 
of butter, softened, one cup of milk and three cups pastry flour. 
Mix in the order given and bake in small gem pans in a moderate 
oven for thirty minutes. 

Apple Sauce — Pare, core and quarter eight apples. Put on to 
cook with one-half teacup of cold water, and five thin slices of 
lemon. Cover as closely as possible and let steam ten minutes 
or till they all are white and light looking. Add one cup of sugar 
and let them steam five minutes longer. Do not stir them at all. 
Put into a glass dish and serve warm. 

Iced Tea — Allow one teaspoonful of tea for each person. Add 
cold water (a cupful for each teaspoonful of tea) and let stand 
four hours. Strain and serve in tail glasses with a slice of lemon 
and ice and loaf sugar to suit the taste of each person. 

Lobster Soup — Take all the shells and remains of the lobster 
left from lunch and put on to boil in one quart of cold water. Let 
boil twenty minutes; strain, add one pint of milk thickened with 
two tablespoons of fiour, and seasoned with one tablespoon of but- 
ter, one teaspoon salt, half teaspoon white pepper, two shakes of 
red pepper. Let all boil up and serve immediately. 

A half cupful of fine cracker crumbs is considered an addi- 
tion by many. 

Steamed Fowl, with Celery Sauce — Select a good plump fowl 



424 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

weighing three or more pounds. Those with soft yellow feet, 
white flesh and not too much fat on the back. Singe over a roll 
of lighted paper. Cut off the head and slip back the skin of the 
neck and cut the neck off close to the opening in the body. Don't 
cut an opening in the breast, as it only has to be sewed up again 
and does not look well when cooked. Draw the windpipe and 
the crop through the neck and stuff the breast full and round 
through the opening in the neck. Draw the skin over to the back 
and either sew or skewer in place. Make an incision over the 
vent and draw the contents out as gently as possible so as not to 
break the gall bladder. Save the gizzard, liver and heart, and 
thoroughly wash the inside, v/ipe dry and stuff, sewing up the 
incision firmly and tying the drumsticks down, so that they will 
stay in place during the cooking. 

Make a stufling by chopping one small head of celery, one 
large onion, three cups of dry bread crumbs, and one tablespoon 
of parsley. Season with one teaspoon of salt, half teaspoon of 
white pepper, three shakes of red pepper, one egg well beaten, and 
a piece of butter as large as an egg. Have all fine and smooth, 
and it will taste like a force meat. Steam two hours or more 
if not tender. Do not have more than three pints of water in the 
lower kettle, and let it boil dovm at the last to about one quart. 

Sauce for Fowl — Tv/o tablespoons of butter, two heaping 
tablespoons of flour, half teaspoon salt, half a teaspoon pepper, 
dash of red pepper and one pint of the water the chicken was 
steamed over, which will be a very rich and strong broth. Melt 
the butter, add flour and seasoning, then gradually the hot stock. 
Have ready a pint of celery that has been chopped fine and boiled 
in a very little water (just enough to keep it from burning) until 
tender; add this to the sauce and pour over the fowl before send- 
ing to the table. Garnish with sprigs of parsley. This is one of 
the best ways of serving a fowl. 

Frozen Peaches — One quart of pared and cut up peaches, one 
quart of water, one pint of sugar. ¥/hen the sugar is dissolved, 
freeze. This is delicious and is a pleasant change from the usual 
creams and sherbets. 

Ten cents worth of maccaroons will be sufficient for five peo- 
ple and are very nice with frozen peaches.

Apple Omelet — Beat separately to a stiff froth the whites and 
yolks of four eggs, add a pinch of salt to the Yv'-hites. Cut tho 
whites into the yolks; sift in tv/o tablespoonfuls of pov/dered 
sugar, four tablespoonfuls of ice water; turn into a larded frying 
pan, and when it thickens spread quickly with apple sauce, sv/eet- 
ened to the taste. Fold the omelet, turn it upon the platter and 
serve hot. 

Rj'^e Puffs — Beat together one tablespoonful of sugar and one 
egg; add one cupful of milk, one cupful of rye liour, half a cupful 
of wheat fiour, one teaspoonful of baking powder, added to the 
flour before mixing; beat hard and bake in quick oven. 

Swiss Eggs— Six eggs, one-quarter of a pound of cheese, one- 
third of a cupful of cream or milk, two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
one teaspoonful of mustard, one-half of a teaspoonful of salt, one- 
tenth of a teaspoonful of cayemie. Cut the cheese into thin shav- 
ings; butter an egg dish or a grating dish (if you have neither, 
use a small stone china platter) and spread the cheese in it. Upon 
the cheese distribute in small portions the remainder of the but 
ter; mix salt, cayenne, mustard and cream; pour half the mixture 
over the cheese; break the eggs into the dish, and after pouring- 
over them the remaining liquid place in oven. Bake eight minutes. 

Sv/eet Potato Puffs — Steam six sweet potatoes and mash fine; 
3"fld one tablespoonful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one 
large saltspoonful of salt; beat very light. Grease custard cups, 
fill nearly full, brush tops with white of an egg and bake in a 
quick oven; serve hot. 

Chicago Rolls — One pound of flour, one pint of milk, one egg, 
one ounce of butter, tv/o tablespoonfuls of yeast, one saltspoonful 
of salt; heat the milk, add the butter and salt. When lukewarm 
beat all together and set to rise in a warm place not less than 
three hours before v/anted. Y/hen risen form into rolls v/ith as 
little handling as possible; let stand half an hour (or until light). 
Bake on tins. 

Small Almond Cakes — Chop half a pound of citron and mix 
with it three-quarters of a pound of shelled almonds, which have 
been blanched and sliced into halves. Beat six eggs thoroughly 



426 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

and cream into them three-quarters of a pound of sugar. Add 
the nuts and citron, and, after thoroughly mixing, sift gradually 
into the mixture half a pound of flour and one spoonful of bak- 
ing powder. Pour the batter into long, shallow tins, which have 
been well buttered. When done roll in powdered almonds and 
sugar. Packed carefully in tin, these cakes will keep almost in- 
definitely. 

Corn Chowder — Remove the husks and silk from six large ears 
of corn, scrape down through the middle of the rows of grain and 
scrape out the interior with the back of a knife. Peel and slice 
one onion; add one pint of potatoes sliced, and cut in dice a quar- 
ter-pound of salt pork. Pry pork and onions in a sauce-pan; take 
them out with a skimmer, and put the other ingredients into the 
drippings in layers, seasoning them palatably with about one 
saltspoonful of salt and three dashes of pepper. Midway put in 
the pork and onions; then the rest of the vegetables and another 
saltspoonful of salt and three dashes of pepper and hot water 
enough to stand an inch above them; cover the 'sauce-pan and 
cook the chowder gently for half an hour after it begins to boil. 
Just before the chowder is done scald one pint of milk and pour 
it over one and one-half pounds of milk or Boston crackers, laid 
in a soup tureen. Cover the tureen for five minutes; then see 
that the chowder is properly seasoned; pour it into the tureen, 
and serve it with a plate of crackers. 

Breaded Lamb Chops — One pound and a half of lamb chops, 
two eggs, beaten. Dip in chops, sprinkle with salt and pepper and 
roll in bread crumbs. Pry in hot fat. Cook five tomatoes in a 
little water (about half a pint), strain and season with one large 
saltspoon of salt, and four dashes of pepper. Put the chops on a 
platter and pour over the dressing. This is delicious. 

Cucumber Salad — Cut the cucumbers in thin slices and soak in 
cold water for one hour; two good sized ones will do. Cut some 
cold, well salted potatoes in thin slices, using about half the quan- 
tity of potatoes that you use cucumbers. Mix them together and 
pour over the following dressing: 

Prench Dressing — One-half teaspoon of salt, one-half salt- 
spoon of pepper, three tablespoonfuls oil, one-fourth teaspoonful 
onion juice, one tablespoonful of vinegar. Mix in order given, 
adding oil slowly. 

Eggplant Baked in Bread Crumbs — This recipe requires one 
young and tender eggplant, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, 
one tablespoonful of vinegar; season with one teaspoonful of salt 
and three dashes of pepper; two tablespoonfuls of butter, if you 
can spare it, if not, one will do; two cups of bread crumbs, and two 
onions grated. Peel the eggplant and cut it in inch dice. Put it 
into the sauce-pan with one gill of boiling water. Simmer very 
gently until tender, but not entirely done, ten to fifteen minutes. 
Then throw it into a colander and drain as dry as possible, squeez- 
ing out the water with a saucer. Meanwhile, fry the onions in 
butter. When the eggplant is thoroughly drained, remove the 
sauce-pan and onions from the fire and stir the eggplant, pars- 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 427 

ley, pepper, salt and vinegar and butter. If the eggplant has 
been properly dried it will absorb the butter entirely. Put in a 
baking dish, cover the top with browned bread crumbs and dots 
of butter, and bake twenty to twenty-five minutes in a good 
oven. There should be nearly one quart of the stewed eggplant 
for the above preparations, therefore, if you have not one large 
one, use two small ones. This is worth trying.

Stewed Pears — Peel and cut them in halves, leaving the stems 
on, and scoop out the cores. Put them into a sauce-pan, placing 
them close together, with the stem ends uppermost. Pour over a 
large cup of water, a small cup of sugar, five whole cloves, a 
stick of cinnamon, a tablespoonful of lemon juice; cover closely, 
stew gently till the pears are tender, then take out carefully and 
place on a dish for serving. Boil down the sirup until quite thick, 
strain and pour over the pears. 

Baked Hash — One pint of cold cooked beef, chopped fine, one 
pint of chopped raw potatoes, one-half pint of gravy or wafer, 
one tablespoonful of melted butter, a large teaspoonful of salt, 
and a quarter teaspoonful of pepper. Mix all well together, turn

428 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

eggs, hastily stir in two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and bake 
in gem pans in a hot oven. 

Banana Sandwiches — Banana sandwiches are new and very 
nice. Take bread at least two days old, cut off the crust, and but- 
ter the end of the loaf; shave off a slice one-eighth of an inch in 
thickness, spread with plain mayonnaise salad dressing, and 
add thin slices of bananas. Cover with another slice of bread. 
Pile on a plate on which a doily has been placed. 

Marshmallow Cakes — When making cookies roll out some of 
the dough thin and cut with a diamond-shaped cutter in size 
about four inches between its long opposite points. Place a 
marshmallow in the center and fold the two opposite long points 
over it and press them together. In baking, the marshmallow will 
swell and round the joined dough, which will be left like the 
handle of a tiny flat basket when the cooling marshmallow con- 
tracts. 

Beefettes — Purchase one and one-half pounds of round steak 
cut about half an inch thick. Then cut in pieces about six inches 
long and four wide. Place on each piece a large tablespoonful 
of dressing made of one cup of stale bread crumbs, one tablespoon- 
ful of chopped parsley, one tablespoonful of chopped onion 
(browned), one-half teaspoonful of salt and two good dashes of 
pepper. Roll up the beefettes and fasten with w^ooden toothpicks. 
Put a tablespoonful of butter and a cup of water in a baking pan 
with the beefettes, and bake three-quarters of an hour in a hot 
oven. Baste often, and when done thicken the gravy, strain and 
pour over the meat and serve on a hot platter. 

Green Beans on Toast — String one quart of fresh, tender 
beans, put over the fire, cover with boiling water and add a pinch 
of baking soda, boil a few minutes, then pour off the water. Re- 
turn them to the fire, with hot water to cover, a large teaspoonful 
of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. Toast six squares of bread, 
and when the beans are tender dip each slice in hot water; but- 
ter and arrange on a platter. Remove the beans with a skimmer 
and lay evenly on the toast. To the water left in the kettle add a 
cup of rich milk, and when it boils stir in a small tablespoonful 
of flour, rubbed smooth in a little cold milk and stir until done; 
add a tablespoonful of butter, and when melted pour over the 
beans and serve at once. The beans are left full length. 

Peach Trifle — Make a boiled custard with the yolks of four 
eggs, one pint of milk and tw^o tablespoonfuls of sugar. When 
cool flavor with a small quarter teaspoonful each of almond and 
vanilla flavor and set on ice. Cut stale sponge cake in slices, lay 
it in the bottom of a pretty dish and cover with a few spoonfuls 
of the custard. Peel and slice six large, ripe peaches, spread them 
over -the cake, dust thickly with powdered sugar. Pour over this 
the custard and cover with a meringue made by whipping the 
whites of eggs with four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar and 
four drops of almond flavoring to a very stiff consistency.

potatoes and a sprig of parsley all together, very fine. Take the 
omelet pan, rub it with a clove of garlic which has been cut in 
two (you can omit the garlic if you wish), put in the pan a small 
lump of butter,, let it get boiling hot, turn in the eggs, and when 
the eggs begin to thicken put in the chopped vegetables; turn

Filled Peppers — Take as many large peppers as you need, 
either green or red and as round as you can get them, cut off the 
tops, take out the seeds, pour boiling water over them and cook 
gently for five minutes; drain thoroughly, then put in a baking 
dish and fill them — without pressing it down — with following 
mixture: Take enough of the white meat of a chicken or of veal

a deep earthenware dish, place in middle a small cup turned up- 
side down (this prevents juice from spilling), line edges of dish 
with pie-crust, then cover dish with same; ornament edges and 
bake one-half or three-quarters of an hour in a good oven. Serve 
hot at table, with cream. (This is English style, and there will 
be found an abundance of fruit to each portion of crust.) 

English Chicken Pie — One large fowl. Skin and cut up into 
joints, put neck, leg and backbone in a stewpan, with a pint or 
so of water and an onion; add a salfspoonful of salt and let 
these stew for about an hour; strain off liquor (this is for gravy). 
Have ready three slices of bacon and three hard-boiled eggs. 
Put a layer of fowl at the bottom of a deep baking dish, then 
slice of bacon, one of the eggs cut in rings, and a pinch of salt 
and pepper. Proceed in this way till dish is full; use in all a tea- 
spoonful of salt and a quarter-teaspoonful of pepper. Pour in

about one-half pint water, border edge of dish with ordinary pie- 
crust, cover dish over with same, ornament top and glaze with 
beaten yolk of an, egg. Bake from one and one-quarter to one 
and one-half hours and when done pour in at the top the gravy 
made from the bones. (Can be served hot or cold.) 

Stewed Celery — Wash four heads of celery; remove the outer 
green stalks; boil in slightly salted water till tender. Nov/ take 
a pint of milk; peel and quarter one onion; simmer it in the 
milk till perfectly tender; strain; crumble one-half pound bread 
crumbs; pour milk over crumbs; add the celery, one tablespoon- 
butter, one-half teaspoon salt, one-fourth teaspoon pepper; sim- 
mer for three minutes, when it will be ready to serve. 

Tea Cakes — One pound flour, one-fourth teaspoon of salt, 
one-eighth pound butter or lard, one egg, a piece of yeast half 
the size of a walnut. Put flour, dry, in basin; mix in salt; rub 
in butter or lard; beat egg well; stir to it the yeast; add these 
to the flour, with as much warm milk as will make the whole into 
a smooth paste; knead well; let rise near fire; when well risen 
form into cakes; place on tins and let rise again until spongy 
before putting into oven; bake from one-fourth to one-half hour 
in moderate oven. They are very nice split and toasted. 

Lemon Sponge — One-half box gelatine, one and three-fourths 
pints water, three-fourths pound sugar, juice three lemons, rind 
of one, the whites of three eggs. Dissolve gelatine in the water; 
strain into saucepan; add sugar, lemon rind and juice; boil from 
ten to fifteen minutes; let stand till it begins to stiffen; then 
beat Y>rliites of the eggs; put them to it, and whisk the mixture 
till it is quite white. Put into a mold, which has been previouGiy 
whetted; let it remain till perfectly set; then turn it out and 
decorate according to taste. Jessie Comport.

Bohemian Buchtells — Three cups of milk, one cup of 
sugar, half a cup of butter, tv/o eggs, a level teaspoon of salt; 
flour to make a stiff batter; one cent's worth compressed yeast, in 
just enough warm Y/ater to dissolve it; fruit, fresh or canned. 
Warm the milk until you can just bear the touch. Add sugar, 
butter melted, eggs beaten, yeast and flour until thick enough to 
roll out on a moulding board, but use no more than you must in 
order to roll it out. Set to rise in a warm place. When very 
light turn onto a board, and roll out until a third of an inch 
thick; . then cut into four-inch squares. In each one of these 
place a small piece of fruit and a sprinkling of sugar. Gather 
the edges together, pressing them, so that they do not separate, 
and set into a large dripping pan. Rub each one v/ith a little melt- 
ed butter and sprinkle over sugar and cinnamon. Let rise again 
until even with the top of the pan, and bake. These can be made 
the day before using; leave in the pan, and a few minutes before 
needed set in a hot oven. 

Pie Plant Marmalade — One and one-half pounds of pie plant; 
one pound sugar, half a,n ounce bitter almonds, blanched and cut 
in halves; one lemon cut into small pieces. Boil well together 
until quite thick. Delicious, and will keep any length of time. 

To Prepare Suet for Prying — Take five pounds nice beef suet, 
cut into small pieces, removing all the fibre. Put into a double 
boiler to melt. Press it off as fast as it melts into the frying 
kettle, that should be on the back of stove. When all the suet 
is melted, add one pint olive oil. This makes a good quantity to 
start the kettle, and by adding scraps of suet from steak occa- 
sionally, and a few spoonfuls of oil, will last a medium-sized fam- 
ily for a year. Should be strained each time it is used, to keep 
free from sediment, and to prevent its getting strong. 

Marguerite Salad — Cut five hard-boiled eggs into slices about 
an eighth of an inch thick. Remove the yolks carefully, so as 
not to break the rings. Place the rings on a lettuce leaf or cress 
in a circle, overlapping each other. Beat the yolks thoroughly 
with two tablespoonfuls of oil, a few drops of lemon juice, an even 
saltspoon of salt, and a sprinkling of cayenne. Heap with a tea- 
spoon into the center of each ring. 

Ginger Pears — Six pounds of sugar; eight pounds of pears, 
peeled and quartered; one pint water, half pound preserved ginger, 
grated peels of three lemons, with juice of one. Boil from four 
and a half to five hours, until clear, and dark as the ginger. Very 
nice served with ice cream. When used as a dessert, heap on 
wafers, and pour cream, whipped or plain, over them. 



434 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Chili Sauce — Eight quarts tomatoes, ten small cayenne or 
red peppers, two cups onions, three cups sugar, one cup salt, three 
pints vinegar, three teaspoons cloves ground, three teaspoons cin- 
namon, four teaspoons each ground ginger and nutmeg. Chop 
tomatoes, peppers and onions very fine. Boil all together three 
hours. Bottle while hot and seal.

teen minutes in a quick oven. Serve very hot. 

Cold Roast Mutton Broiled — Cut the mutton in inch-thick 
slices, and score them; mix two teaspoonfuls of mustard with 
four of olive oil, two of vinegar and a dash of cayenne pepper; 
spread this mixture in the incisions in the mutton, then broil 
meat over a clear, hot fire. Place them on a heated platter, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper and dot with pieces of butter. Serve 
very hot with currant jelly.

them into a glass dish, and whip with egg-beater one cup of cream 
and one cup of sugar; pour over the apples. When cold serve.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 435 

and pare and slice the tomatoes, allowing one pint of tomatoes to

ter and bake half an hour. Mrs. John Buie.

Sweetbreads in Tomato — Procure one pound calf's sweet- 
breads; remove all the tough parts; put them in cold water to 
soak over night; wash in morning and put them over the fire 
in cold water. As soon as it boils pour it off, put on more; let 
them simmer half an hour; add to the water a tablespoonful of 
salt ten minutes before taking off the fire; drain and cool by plung- 
ing into cold water; then drain. This process of parboiling makes 
or mars the delicious flavor of the sweetbreads. The thin mem- 
brane which covers each section must be removed. Should these 
pieces have a reddish tint they are not cooked enough, boil a few 
minutes more. Slice and fry to a golden brown in two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter or drippings. Pare five medium-sized tomatoes and 
cut into small pieces. When the sweetbreads are brown remove 
them and cook the tomatoes in the butter in which they were 
fried. Stir often and let them cook to pieces. Season with a half- 
teaspoonful of salt, one-fifth teaspoonful of pepper and a pinch 
of cloves. When they have cooked to a smooth consistency stir in 
a teaspoonful of butter rolled in flour. Drop the sweetbreads in 
the tomatoes, boil up once and serve. 

Pickled Lambs' Tongues — Boil until tender in salted water. 



436 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

using a tablespoonful of salt to two quarts of v^^ater; then remove 
the skin, place the tongues in a jar, and pour over saliicient hot 
vinegar to cover, adding a teaspoonful of whole peppers, and three 
whole cloves, if liked; cover close and they are ready for use the 
next day. 

Plum Shortcake — One quart of flour, sifted dry, with tv>^o large 
teaspoonfuls of haking powder, one tablespoonful of sugar and a 
good pinch of salt. Add three tablespoonfuls of butter, and sweet 
milk enough to form a soft dough. Bake in a quick oven, and 
v/hen partially cooled split open, spread liberally with butter and 
cover with a layer of plums, which have been previously stewed, 
sweetened and cooled (a quart of unstewed plums is needed), lay- 
ing the other half on top and spreading in the same manner with 
the plums. This is first cousin to strawberry shortcake in point of 
toothsomeness. 

Tapioca and Milk Soup—Use half a cupful of tapioca, two cup- 
fuls of water, tv/o pints of milk, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one 
of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth teaspoonful of pep- 
per, one medium-sized onion, two blades of celery and a slight 
grating of nutmeg. Wash the tapioca and soak it for six hours in 
the two cupfuls of cold water, put it in a double boiler and cook 
an hour. Then put the milk in another double boiler and set it 
on the stove to heat. Now put the butter, tlie onion and the cel- 
ery, chopped fine, into a small frying-pan and cook slowly for ten 
minutes; add the flour and stir until smooth ard frothy. Pour the 
contents of the pan into the boiler of hot milk; add the salt, pep- 
per and nutmeg; cook ten minutes longer. Then strain the milk 
mixture into the boiler containing the tapioca and cook all for 
half an hour. 

Roast Duck — Select a two or tv/o and a half pound bird; clean 
and truss the duck and stuff with a dressing made as follows: 
Take one pint of stale bread (there must be no hard pieces) and 
break into very fine crumbs; add a half teaspoonful of salt, a quar- 
ter teaspoonful of pepper, a half teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 
half a teaspoonful of powdered sage, one-half teaspoonful of sum- 
mer savory, a teaspoonful of chopped onion (if liked) and one- 
third cupful of butter; mix v/ell. This gives a rich dressing that 
will separate like rice when served, and is good with any fowl. 
Rub the bird v/ith a teaspoonful of salt before stuffing it. Take 
soft butter in the hand and rub thickly over the fowl, then dredge 
rather thickly with flour so it will be just covered. Putting the 
butter and flour on makes a paste, which keeps the juices confined 
and also gives a rich basting. Place on the meat rack in a 
hot oven for a few moments to brown the flour, then add water 
enough to cover the pan. The water must be renewed a little at 
a time when needed. Baste every fifteen minutes with the gravy 
in the pan, and dredge with a little salt, pepper and flour. When 
one side is browned, turn and brown the other. This v*^ill bake in 
an hour in a quick oven. Before sending to the table squeeze over 
it the juice of a lemon or orange, and serve up very hot with its 
own gravy about It. Eat with currant jelly. Chop the giblets fine 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 437 

and stew slowly in as little water as possible with a tablespoon- 
fiil of butter rolled in flour. Season with a saltspoonful of salt and 
three dashes of pepper. Serve in a gravy boat. 

Select long, slender sweet potatoes, peel and lay in the roast- 
ing-pan around the duck a half an hour before it is done. The 
gravy will flavor them nicely. 

Coffee Sherbet — To a pint of strong coffee add a pint of double 
cream and six ounces of sugar and six drops of vanilla essence. 
Use a tablespoonful and a half of fine ground coffee to a half 
pint of water. Put coffee, cream, sugar and extract in the freezer 
surrounded with salted ice; keep the sides free as fast as the ice 
begins to cling. When congealed serve in glasses,

Mutton Haggis — Chop quite fine the uncooked heart, tongue 
and half-liver of a sheep, mix with them half their weight in 
chopped bacon, half -cup bread crumbs, grated rind of a lemon, 
quarter-teaspoonful of pepper (the bacon should make them salt 
enough), two well-beaten eggs; pack in a buttered mold, cover, 
place in a kettle partly filled with boiling water and cook slowly 
two hours. Serve with: 

Bechamel Sauce — Put four tablespoonfuls of butter and three 
of fiour in a sauce-pan, pour on this three gills of boiling water;

granite stewpan put one-half cup of sugar and as much water; 
when this boils put in plums and stew for ten minutes. 

Potato Pancakes — Grate ten good-sized potatoes into a pan 
with cold water. When all are grated drain in a fine sieve or 
lay a piece of cheese cloth on a colander and press out all the 
water. To the pulp add four eggs and two teaspoonfuls of salt. 
Have the griddle very hot and well greased. Put in two table- 
spoonfuls of the batter and spread out into a flat cake. Bake to a 
crisp brown on both sides. Never use the least bit of flour, or you 
will surely spoil them. 

Lettuce Salad — Wash two heads of lettuce; tear each leaf into 
two or three pieces; drain until dry and pour over it the folio v/ing 
dressing: 

Cream Dressing — Put a level teaspoonful of salt into small 
bowl; mix with half a cup of sweet cream; then pour into this two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar; stir rapidly, so it will not curdle. 

Ox-Tail Soup — Cut two ox tails into short pieces; roll in flour, 
two tablespoonfuls will do. Put in soup-kettle, with three quarts 
of water, a heaping teaspoonful of salt, one dozen peppercorns, 
two whole onions, one carrot, one small turnip, one stalk of celery, 
three sprigs of parsley. Let boil slowly for three hours. Take

same as for slaw, put in granite stewpan, cover with boiling 
water, add half level tablespoonful of salt, a generous tablespoon- 
ful of good dripping or sweet lard and five tablespoonfuls of vine- 
gar. Let this cook slowly for two hours, then dust in one-half 
tablespoonful of flour and cook ten minutes longer. This is the 
German way of cooking red cabbage, and is excellent. 

Celery-Root Salad — Wash four celery roots; boil in salted 
water, allowing about one-half tablespoonful to two quarts of 
water, until they can be easily pierced with a fork. When done

eggs, one cup of milk, three-quarters teaspoonful of salt, one-half 
saltspoonful of pepper. Stir all together and fill five small but- 
tered cups; set cups in pan of hot water and bake until firm in 
center. Turn out on a platter and serve. 

Corn and Rice Muffins — Two cups of white cornmeal sifted 
with a teaspoonful of salt, one and one-half cups of boiled rice, 
one teaspoonful of lard, enough boiling Vv^ater to scald it all and 
leave it thick (about three ciipfuls); let cool, then add one cup 
s our milk, one-half teaspoonful of soda dissolved in milk and two 
v; Gil-beaten eggs. Bake in gom tins one-half hour. 

Ham and Egg Sandwiches — Chop one cupful of cold boiled 
ham very fine, put tliree fresh eggs into boiling water and let 
simmer one-half hour, then place them in cold water to remove 
the shells easily; chop the eggs fine, add to the ham; season with 
a saltspoonful of dry mustard and one-half that quantity of cay- 
enne pepper. Slice bread a day old very thin, cut in rounds with 
biscuit cutter, spread thinly v/ith butter, then with the ham and 
egg mixture, cover with another buttered round. (The crusts and 
pieces of bread should be dried in a slow oven and rolled to be 
used in croquettes, etc.) 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 441 

Spiced Peaches — To seven pounds of peaches take four pounds 
of sugar and a pint of vinegar. Stick two cloves into each peach, 
prick with a fork and stew until tender. Lay them in a jar and 
pour on them the well-boiled and boiling sirup. Let them stand

the fruit. When cold they are ready for use. Peaches that are 
not soft enough to slice may be used. 

Jam Puffs — Roll out puff paste very thin, cut in rounds v/ith 
large cookie-cutter, lay a tablespoonful of jam (any kind) on 
each, v/Gt the edges with white of an egg, fold over and pinch the 
edges firmly together, brush' over v/ith the egg and bake fifteen 
minutes. 

The above makes a good school lunch, in which case each sep- 
arate piece should be wrapped in tissue paper, the peaches put in 
a small glass or earthen dish with cover, and a bottle of milk 
or milk and coffee substituted for the tea, 

French Shoulder of Veal — Cut the meat into cubes and par- 
boil them. Put the bones and trimmings into another pot and 
stew them slowly for t^vo hours (to make the gravy) in a quart 
of water. Put the meat into the dish in v/hich it is to be served, 
sprinkle over it a teaspoonful of salt, a fourth as much cayenne 
pepper, the yelloAV rind of a lemon grated and half a grated nut- 
meg. Use the juice of lemon for tea. Add a tablespoonful of but- 
ter rolled in the same quantity of flour; strain the gravy, pour it 
over the meat and bake until brown in a hot oven. 

Jellied Grapes — Place two cupfuls of washed and stemmed 
grapes in a deep dish (a good way to use the loose grapes in a 
basket), sprinkle among them one-half cup each of boiled rice 
and sugar, pour over them one-half cup of water, cover close and 
bake two hours in slow oven. Serve very cold with cream. A 
delicate dish. Mrs. Carrie Lav/ton.

Sirloin steak. 

Wax beans. Potato souffle.

Coffee. 



Oysters a la Kalamazoo — One quart salt oysters, drained; two 
level teaspoonfuls cornstarch, or four teaspoonfuls flour; salt- 
spoonful celery salt, one-quarter saltspoonful white pepper, juice 
of one-half lemon. Melt butter, add flour and seasoning. Put 
in oysters and cook until their edges curl. Serve very hot on 
slices of graham bread, toasted and buttered. 

Pried Apples — Pare, core and cut into cart-wheels with hol- 
low centers eight tart apples — slices one-quarter inch thick. 
Sprinkle with thick layer of sugar and juice of one lemon, half 
an hour before frying. Heat one tablespoonful butter in frying- 
pan; put layer of apples in, sugared side down; cover, to steam 
until soft. Remove cover and allow them to brown. Use plenty 
of butter and continue to fry until all are done. Pour over them 
the sauce from the pan and heap with whipped cream. 

Sirloin Steak — Remove bone. Two or three hours before 
cooking mix a tablespoonful of olive oil, with one teaspoonful of 
salt and one-quarter teaspoonful of pepper. Rub this mixture 
thoroughly over both sides of the steak and let lie on plate until 
time to cook it. Broil over a fire of bright coals, or a gas-range 
broiler; serve on a hot platter, with cress or parsley garnish. 
Two objects are attained by this process — the steak is thorough- 
ly seasoned through without waste of the juices, which are pre- 
vented from passing out by the oil, and the oil passes into the 
fiber of the meat, making it tender and rich. 

Potato Souffle — Steam six good-sized potatoes in their jackets. 
When done, peel and mash them; then add one tablespoonful 
butter, one-half pint hot cream, one teaspoonful salt and one- 
fourth teaspoonful white pepper. Beat until smooth and light. 
Beat whites of two eggs to a stiff froth; stir them gently into the 
potatoes; heap on a baking-dish, and put in a quick oven to 
brown. Serve in the dish in which they were baked. Two heap- 
ing tablespoonfuls of grated cheese added with the cream is an 
improvement. 

Cream Chocolate Pudding — Two squares Baker's unsweetened 
chocolate, four rounded teaspoonfuls granulated sugar, four 
tablespoonfuls hot water, one saltspoonful salt, one saltspoon- 
ful vanilla extract or cinnamon, four yolks of eggs or two whole 
eggs, one-half cupful cream, one-quarter cupful milk. Cook 
sugar, chocolate and hot water to smooth, shiny paste, letting it 
boil Lard, but stir carefully, that it may not scorch. Add milk 
and cream, less one tablespoonful, which should be added to 
egg yolks to prevent curdling. Stir until it boils. Put dish in a 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 443 

pan of hot water and add eggs carefully, yolks first, stirring very, 
very fast. After it thickens, fold the beaten whites in lightly and 
gently, adding the salt and vanilla. Leave covered, over pan of 
hot water, ten minutes or longer until spongy. Sprinkle pow- 
dered sugar on top and serve, hot or cold, v/ith whipped cream 
heaped on top. A most dainty, delicious dessert.

salt, and two teaspoonfuls of baking powder together; rub in one 
tablespoonful of butter, cold; then add one beaten egg and a pint 
of milk; mix soft as possible. Roll out one-half an inch in 
thickness, and cut with a biscuit cutter. Dip them in melted but- 
ter, fold one-third of each piece over the remainder, and bake in 
a quick oven for fifteen minutes. 

Cheese Cream Toast — Stale bread may be used as follows: 
Toast the slices and cover them slightly with grated cheese; 
make a cream for five slices out of half a pint of milk and a 
tablespoonful of flour; the milk should be boiling and the flour

mixed in a little cold water before stirring in. When the cream 
is nicely cooked, season with a saltspoonful of salt and a tea- 
spoonful of butter; set the toast and cheese in the oven for four 
minutes; then pour the cream over them. 

Celery Salad — Cut the white stalks of celery into pieces a 
half-inch long. To one pint of these pieces allow a half-pint of 
mayonnaise dressing. Dust the celery lightly with salt and pep- 
per; mix it with the dressing; heap it on a cold plate, garnish 
with white tips of the celery and serve at once. Do not mix the 
celery and dressing until you are ready to use the salad. 

Peanut Cookies — Shell sufficient peanuts to give one pint of 
tlie meats. Rub off all the inner skin and chop very fine, or put 
through a meat cutter. Cream together two tablespoonfuls of 
butter and one cup of sugar; add three eggs, two tablespoonfuls 
of milk, one-fourth teaspoonful of salt, the chopped peanuts, and 
flour enough to make a soft dough. Roll out, cut in circles and 
bake in a moderate oven. 

Tomato Tapioca Soup — To one pint of strained red tomatoes 
add one-half tablespoonful of extract of beef, one tablespoonful of 
butter, three small tablespoonfuls of minute tapioca, one and one- 
half pints of hot water, a teaspoonful of salt and a quarter tea- 
spoonful of pepper; boil fifteen minutes. Serve with croutons. 

Halibut Steak Stuffed and Baked — Secure two shapely steaks; 
wash and thoroughly dry them with a towel. Make a stuffing 
from a cupful of crumbs, tablespoonful of butter, a tablespoon- 
ful of onion juice, one of chopped parsley, a dash of cayenne, 
quarter teaspoonful of black pepper, just a grating of nutmeg 
and quarter of a, teaspoonful of salt. Place one steak in the bak- 
ing-pan; lay carefully over it the stuffing and place above it the 
other steak. Put small pieces of butter over the top, and dust 
slightly with salt and pepper. Bake until a golden brown, about 
thirty minutes. Cover the pan tightly for the first twenty min- 
utes. Serve on a hot platter, with garnish of sliced lemon. 

Frizzled Beans— String and break into inch lengths as many 
beans as are required for five persons; boil until tender in plenty 
of salted water; drain in a colander and dredge slightly and 
evenly with sifted flour. Put a tablespoonful of butter in a fry- 
ing-pan, and when hot pour in the beans and turn frequently; 
allowing all to come next to the pan in turn. Serve hot. 

Peach Pudding — Pare and stone one quart of ripe peaches, 
and cut in quarters. Beat the whites of three eggs with half a 
cup of powdered sugar until it is stiff enough to cut with a knife. 
Take the yolks and mix with half a cupful of granulated sugar 
and a pint of milk. Put the i;eaches into the mixture, place in a 
baking' dish and bake until almost firm; then put in the whites, 
mixing all thoroughly again, and bake a light brown. Serve ice 
cold. Marion C. Wilson.

Hashed and Browned Potatoes^ — One quart cooked potatoes, 
cut into pieces, two tablespoonfuls of butter, one tablespoonful 
of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter teaspoonful of pep- 
per, one teaspoonful of minced onion, one-half pint soup stock. 
Put the onion and half the butter into a frying-pan, and when 
the onion turns a light straw color, add the flour and stir until 
smooth and frothy. Gradually add the soup stock and stir until 
It boils, then add half the salt and pepper and cook five minutes; 
season the potatoes with the remainder of the salt and pepper 
and stir them into the sauce and cook five minutes without stir- 
ring. Put the remainder of the butter into another frying-pan, 
and when it is quite hot turn the potatoes into this pan and cook 
fifteen minutes, until browned thoroughly. Fold them over like 
an omelet, and turn on to a warm dish and serve at once, gar- 
nishing with a little parsley. 

Salmon Salad — One quart cooked salmon, two heads of let- 
tuce, two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, one tablespoonful vine- 
gar, one-half teaspoonful salt, one-quarter teaspoonful pepper, 
one cupful of French dressing. Break up the salmon and sea- 
son it with the salt, pepper, vinegar and lemon juice. Keep in a 
cool place for two hours. At serving time (save enough of the 
lettuce leaves, well washed, to border the dish), tear the remain- 
der in pieces and arrange these in the center of a flat dish; on 
them heap the salmon lightly and cover with the dressing. Ar- 
range the whole leaves at the base. Any kind of fish left from 
the day before may be used for this salad. 



446 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

French Dressing — Three tablespoonfuls of olive oil or melt- 
ed butter, one tablespoonful of vinegar, one-half teaspoonful of 
salt — or less, if butter is used — one-quarter teaspoonful of pepper, 
if desired also, one-half teaspoonful mustard. Mix thoroughly- 
one tablespoonful of the oil with the salt and pepper and mustard, 
then add the remainder of the oil and the vinegar. 

Lamb Chops, Breaded — Take about two pounds of lamb 
chops, having had the bones taken out; rub over them a tea- 
spoonful of salt and a quarter-teaspoonful of pepper, then dip 
them in one well-beaten egg, and roll in fine cracker crumbs, 
and fry brown in hot butter. 

Pried Summer Squash — Take three or four small and tender 
summer squash (crooknecks are the best), cut in slices about one- 
half inch thick, taking out the seeds; boil them half an hour, or 
until tender, in slightly salted water. When done, fry them in 
butter until a delicate brown. 

Frozen Peaches — One quart of quite ripe peaches, after they 
are peeled and cut into pieces, one heaping pint of granulated 
sugar, one quart of water, two cupfuls of whipped cream; boil 
the sugar and water together ten or fifteen minutes and' cool. 
Rub the peaches through a sieve, add them to the sirup and 
freeze. When the beater is taken out, stir in the whipped cream; 
cover and set away an hour before serving. 

Lemon Sponge Cake — Five eggs, one and a quarter cups of 
sugar, one and a half cups of flour, the juice and grated rind of 
half a lemon, one pinch of salt; beat the yolks and sugar together 
until very light, add the lemon juice and rind and salt; beat 
the whites to a stiff froth; stir the flour and this froth alternate- 
ly, part at a time, into the beaten yolks and sugar, folding care- 
fully from the sides of the bowl, so as not to break the froth. 
B^ill the pan about half full, and put into the oven not quite hot 
enough to bake, leaving one door ajar, until it rises almost to the 
top of the pan. Then close the oven and bake about three-quar- 
ters of an hour. Very delicate and nice.

DINNER.

Pried Tomatoes — Six washed tomatoes, a half cup of flour, 
teaspoon level full of salt, one-third as much pepper. Scald and 
skin tomatoes and cut larger ones into three slices, small ones 
into two. Put flour into a soup-plate with salt and pepper, mix- 
ing well. Roll each slice of tomato in this seasoned flour and fry 
in a pan in very hot lard; that is, have the lard very hot when 
you put in the tomatoes; then let them cook very slowly; when 
a dark brown turn, and fry on other side. 

Tomatoes may also be fried in bacon drippings and are deli- 
cious with the crisped bacon. 

Creamed Fish — This dish is delicious, no fish freshly cooked 
being better. Put a good tablespoonful of butter in a pan, let it 
brown slightly (the browning gives the sauce a rich color), and 
add an even tablespoonful of flour; blend well and add milk till 
consistency of rather thick sauce or gravy. Seasoning: A level 
teaspoonful of salt, a half saltspoonful of pepper and ginger each; 
a shake of cayenne and two or three of mace. Cook two or three 
minutes, add a cupful of cold cooked fish in pieces size of lima 
beans or larger, and cook ten minutes. Serve in hot platter 
garnished with parsley. 

Rice Griddle Cakes — Break three eggs, putting the yolks into 
a large bowl (size used for cake mixing), the whites into a small- 
er one. Add a large cup of milk and level teaspoonful of salt 
to yolks and beat well with dover beater. Now add flour enough 
to make a very stiff batter, almost dough, and beat hard for three 
or four minutes. When so beaten put in milk until you have a 
rather thin batter which will be perfectly smooth and aerated. 
Next put in a cup of rice, cooked, the grains well separated, one 
heaping teaspoonful of baking powder and the whites of eggs, 
beaten to a stiff froth. Bake on griddle, dipping always to bot- 
tom of bowl, as the rice sinks. Never turn a cake twice — it makes 
it heavy. Remember the batter should be as thin as you can 
manage to bake it. The thinner the batter the more delicate the 
cake or wafile. 

Coffee — An excellent way to make coffee and get its full 
strength is as follows: Grind as much coffee as you require, very 
flne, put into pot with crushed eggshells, adding water in regu- 
lar proportion to coffee used. Let this come slowly to a boil, 
keeping it tightly covered. When the boiling point is reached, 
draw back a moment and then again let it come to a boil. Send 
immediately to table, and you will find your coffee is stronger 
and smoother, with a finer aroma than when made in the usual 
manner. Never use the whites of eggs to clear. It coats the 
grounds and the essence cannot escape. 



448 ' THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Meat Patties — When you make pie crust always fill your 
tart tins and keep these paste shells for meat patties as well as 
tarts. Do not bake them too brown, so they may take just the 
right color when heated over for the patties. For the filling of 
meat patties fry two or three slices of onion brown in a table- 
spoonful of butter, adding a bay leaf, a saltspoonful of salt, and a 
half-saltspoonful of pepper, as much ginger, a shake of cayenne 
and nutmeg each, a teaspoonf ul of Worcestershire sauce, and, Y/hen 
the butter is right brown, add enough good soup stock to make a 
rather thick gravy. Strain, return to pan, and put in a cup of 
cold cooked meat (preferably veal or lamb), v/hich has been 
minced very fine. Let cook five or ten minutes and fill into pat- 
tie-cases which have been heated very hot in the oven. Send 
to table on hot platter. 

Cream of Celery Soup — Celery soup made of milk, celery, but- 
ter, flour and a little onion juice is very good, but it is not the 
best that can be made by any means. The best results are ar- 
rived at from the following method of preparing: Cut up toler- 
ably fine a pound of round steak (or use its equivalent in odds 
and ends of cold meat) and put in a pot with two quarts of cold 
water. Bring to a boil, and then set back to simmer gently, 
covered. At the end of two hours add a stalk of celery, cut in 
inch pieces, a good half-cup of rice, a teaspoonful of salt and a 
small onion, sliced. Let all simmer for two hours longer, and 
then add a cup of rich milk and strain. There should be a quart 
of stock before putting in the milk. The rice both thickens and 
helps flavor the soup. If you v/ish to add another touch a cup of 
whipped cream is in order, and a couple of large spoonfuls of 
cooked rice is also an addition. 

Southern Chicken — Steam the chicken when nicely dressed 
(whole) for one hour, if young; until tender if older; putting 
the gizzard, feet (skinned) and neck in the water below the 
steamer, of which there should be a good pint and a half in the 
pot when the steaming is finished. A chicken a year old or a 
little less is as ' good if not better than one young- 
er. When steamed, take out and put down in 
the chicken stock in the pot to cool and absorb the juice. Do 
this in the moraing and let stay till dinner time, when the chick- 
en is removed and cut up for frying; or, if small, divided into 
two. pieces, the legs, second joint and lower part of back forming 
one piece, the breast and v/ings the other. Put in a soup plate 
one-half cup of flour seasoned with one saltspoon of pepper and 
one-half teaspoonful of salt; roll the pieces of chicken in this and 
put on to fry in drippings — lard and butter mixed — or, better still, 
in chicken fat, if there was any taken from the stock in the pot. 
The chicken being already cooked, It is only necessary to fry 
until you have a golden brown surface to the pieces, vv^hen you 
remove to a hot platter and stand in warming oven. Put a table- 
spoonful of flour in the pan (and a little extra butter of neces- 
sary) and let it brown very slightly; then add the chicken stock 
and a half-cup of cream or milk. Season with a half teaspoonful 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 449 

of salt and a saltspoonful pepper. Strain this gravy over the 
chicken, and send to table garnished with parsley or the tops of 
celery. 

Corn Oysters — Grate eight ears of corn and scrape the cob. 
Beat (separately) two eggs, adding the yolks to pulp, with a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Next add a small cup of cracker crumbs, and 
lastly the beaten whites. The amount of crumbs depends upon 
the milkiness of the corn — a thick corn batter being necessary. 
Never use flour or milk — the cracker carries out the oyster flavor 
and idea admirably, being a real addition. Fry (oyster shape) in 
hot lard or drippings. Put in oven to keep hot and crisp a lit- 
tle while others are frying. 

Eggplant — Never cook it in batter; it is abominable. Peel, 
slice, and sprinkle each slice with salt at noon. Put in a bowl with 
a plate on top, a flat-iron to press it down. At dinner time wash 
dry, roll in flour, seasoned with pepper (salt will be unneces- 
sary) and fry in hot drippings or sweet lard to a rich dark brown. 

Stewed Tomatoes — Scald, skin and cut in pieces the amount 
you wish to use. For a quart or little over put in the saucepan 
with the tomatoes a small onion (it improves the flavor), a good 
teaspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonful of pepper, one shake of 
cayenne and a tablespoonful of sugar. Let the tomatoes cook 
slowly uncovered three-quarters of an hour, when they should 
look "boiled down" and a rich color. A few minutes before serv- 
ing add a large-sized slice of bread cut in neat small dice. 

Grape Tart — Prepare the grapes by "popping" the pulp out 
of the skin, cooking till soft, rubbing through a soup sieve, re- 
turning with the skins to the cooking vessel, adding a cup of 
sugar for each cup of water and boiling gently for flfteen minutes 
or more. You now have a rich, seedless grape filling for your 
tarts. The tart shells are, of course, made of good pie crust, for 
which an unfailing recipe is as follows: Use any size cup or 
tumbler for measuring you desire, only preserving the exact pro- 
portions. Three even cups of flour, one-half saltspoonful of 
salt, two even cups of shortening and a scant one of ice water, 
in which is the juice of half a lemon and a pinch of salt. Cold 
is the secret of good pie crust. Put your flour on a bread board 
and a cup and one-third of lard in the midst; chop them together 
till well mixed, and if the lard is not fine enough rub quickly be- 
tween the hands. Now work in the Vv^ater with a knife, not 
touching with the hands (some flour takes more water than oth- 
ers, but bear in mind that you want a stiff, not a soft, dough). 
Now sprinkle with flour, roll out with a rolling-pin and spread 
with one-third cup butter. Cut in three pieces, piling them to- 
gether; again cut in three and pile together; sprinkle with 
flour and flatten (by little blows) with the rolling-pin. Now put 
on a platter or a plate or in a small porcelain dripping pan and 
put it on ice. When thoroughly cold roll out again, spread with 
one-third cup of butter (the last of your two cups of shortening), 
cut, pile up, pound together and put on ice as before. When next 
cold it is ready to be baked as pies or tarts — and almost equal to

the best of puff paste. The directions when read once seem elab- 
orate, but tried once they seem as simple as any pie crust. It 
may be kept on ice for several days.

Roll Breakfast Cake — Two coffee cups of bread dough when 
ready for the baking pans, four scant tablespoonfuls of butter, 
two of sugar, the white of one egg well beaten, a saltspoonful of 
soda dissolved in a little water, and one-half teaspoonful of finely 
ground cinnamon. Mix all thoroughly together, using sufficient 
flour to make the dough stiff enough to roll. Roll one-fourth of an 
inch thick and spread with a paste made by stirring two-thirds 
of a cup of sugar into one well-beaten egg; roll up like jelly cake, 
cut transversely into pieces one inch thick, set on ends close to- 
gether in shallow tins, let stand till very light and bake in a rather 
quick oven. Excellent warm or cold.

Serve vs^ith toasted crackers or fried cubes of stale bread. 

Braised Liver — Scald and remove as much of the skin as pos- 
sible. Pin thin slices of salt pork or bacon over the rounded side, 
using small wooden skewers to hold them in place. Fry one 
sliced onion and put it with the liver into a deep granite pan or a 
large-mouthed jar — anything that can be covered closely. Cover 
with boiling water; add one-half teaspoonful of salt, one salt- 
spoonful of pepper, four whole cloves and one teaspoonful of whole 
thyme or marjoram. Place the pan in a moderate oven, cover 
closely and cook slowly from two to three hours. After the water 
is reduced one-half baste often, and when the liver is tender re- 
move it and put the liquor on to boil. Skim off the fat, thicken it 
with flour wet In cold water; add juice of half a lemon, or half 
a cup of catchup, and strain over the liver. 

Brown Betty — Butter a deep pudding-dish, and place a layer 
of finely chopped apples in the bottom, then add a layer of very 
fine bread crumbs; sprinkle with two tablespoonfuls of sugar and 
one-fourth teaspoonful of cinnamon; dot with butter; then an- 
other layer of apples, and so on until the dish is filled. The top 
layer should be of the crumbs. Bake in a moderate oven until 
quite brown, and serve while hot, either with sweetened cream or

when very hot put in the liver; turn after five minutes and when 
done place on a hot dish. While this is cooking, try in another 
pan crisp and brown a quarter of a pound of bacon, cut in thin 
rashers, so it will be done at the same time as the liver. Pour 
most of the fat from both pans, adding a little from that in which

Eggs, with Tomato Sauce — Boil six eggs hard; cut lengthwise 
and lay on a dish; cover with tomato sauce; stand over hot water 
about ten minutes. 

For the Sauce — Cook slowly one pint of tomatoes, with a slice 
of onion, sprig of parsley, two or three cloves and a bay leaf, for 
fifteen minutes; then strain. Melt a tablespoonful of butter; add 
a tablespoonful of flour, then the tomato, and stir until it thick- 
ens; add also a half-teaspoonful of salt and a half-saltspoonful of 
pepper. 

Celery Sandwiches — Take the tops of young celery; wash care- 
fully and lay between thin slices of bread that have been spread 
with mayonnaise dressing. 

Cream of Rice Soup — To one quart of clear stock add one cup 
of rice, a slice of onion and a sprig each of parsley and celery. 
Boil one-half hour and put through a sieve. Scald one and one- 
half cupfuls of milk and add to the strained rice, with a heaping 
teaspoonful of salt and a quarter-saltspoonful of pepper. Just be- 
fore serving add half a cupful of cream. If you haven't the cream, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter makes it very tasty. 

Baked Trout — Have a trout weighing about four pounds. Boil 
three potatoes, good-sized ones; mash with two tablespoonfuls of 
butter, a teaspoonful of onion juice, a saltspoonful of salt and a 
half-saltspoonful of pepper. Stuff the fish with this, sprinkle 
with salt and pepper, and put in dripping-pan with two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, six tomatoes and half a cupful of water. Bake 
in moderate oven fifty minutes. Serve with the tomatoes and 
slices of hard-boiled eggs. 

Cucumber Salad — Slice three cucumbers and one onion and let 



456 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

stand in ice water one hour. Lay them on crisp lettuce leaves and 
serve with French or mayonnaise dressing. 

Apple Pie — Rub together one scant cupful of flour with two 
tablespoonfuls of lard and one of butter and a saltspoon of salt. 
Wet with just enough cold water to make a stiff dough. Roll and 
line a deep pie tin. Have sour apples sliced thin, and have 
plenty of them — the pan should be heaped. Half a cup of sugar is 
usually enough to cover them. Grate nutmeg over this and dot 
small bits of butter all around. Lay the upper crust over them; 
wet the edges and press together. The top crust should be per- 
forated in the middle. Bake in a moderate oven forty-five min- 
utes. 

The cheese to be very appetizing should be grated and laid in 
a dish on a dainty doily. Mrs. C. B. Scott.

Bacon Fraze — Beat four eggs into a batter, with one-half 
teacupful of milk and one teaspoonful of flour; fry some thin 
slices of bacon and dip them in it; lay the bacon in the frying 
pan; pour the batter over it, and when both sides are well 
browned lay on a heated dish and serve. 

Fried Apples — Peel apples, cut into eighths, taking out the 
seeds and cores carefully from each piece. Heat some drippings 
in a frying pan; coat the apples lightly with flour, and fry to a 
pale brown; drain off the fat from each piece, sprinkle with 
sugar and pile on a hot dish. If you like you may mix a little 
cinnamon with the sugar. Use only tart apples. Serve with 
slices of brown bread. 

Roll Jelly Cake — One cup sifted flour, one of granulated sugar, 
three eggs, one large teaspoonful of baking powder. Stir quick- 
ly; pour into dripping pan and bake in a hot oven. Turn on a 
clean white cloth, wrung out of water; spread with jelly and 
roll by raising the cloth with the cake and your cake will be a 
success. 

Fillet of Beef — Take about two or two and a half pounds of 
fillet. After it is trimmed and larded put into a small baking 
pan in the bottom of which are some chopped pieces of pork and 
beef suet; sprinkle some salt and pepper over it and a half-pint 
of hot stock. Baste often; cook a full half-hour in a hot oven. 

Mushroom Sauce — Take two teacupfuls of stock; thicken with 
two teaspoonfuls of flour and two teaspoonfuls of butter, mixed; 
add one-half teaspoonful of salt and a few dashes of pepper. Fry 
six or eight mushrooms in butter; add to the thickened stock a 
few drops of lemon juice and the mushrooms. Simmer a few 
minutes and pour over the beef. 

Mixed Pickles — One gallon cucumbers, cut small; one gallon 
green tomatoes, quartered; half a gallon of onions, steamed; 
two heads of cauliflower, steamed; half dozen green peppers. 
Scald in strong brine; let stand one or two days. 

Dressing — One gallon cider vinegar, twelve tablespoonfuls of 
mustard or one jug of French mustard, two cups of sugar, two 
tablespoonfuls of turmeric powder, one large cup of flour, wet 
with a little cold vinegar; put into boiling vinegar, boil five min- 
utes and put on the thoroughly drained pickles. These are the 



458 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK!. 

finest mixed pickles I ever made; the turmeric powder gives it a 
yellow color. If string beans are liked, put in two quarts of 
steamed ones. 

Peach Cream — Whip one pint of sweet cream to a stiff froth, 
laying it on a sieve. Pare one dozen large peaches and boil them 
with half a pound of sugar. When they reach the condition of 
marmalade press them through a colander. Take half a box of 
gelatine, which has been soaked an hour in half a cupful of water 
in a warm place near the stove, and add a tumberful of good 
cream. Stir it thoroughly to make it smooth, and when it is 
about to harden add the whipped cream, stirring lightly in till it 
is well mixed, then put it into a mold and set on the ice or in a 
cool place. A pretty garnish is to arrange halves or quarters of 
fresh peaches around it. This is a very dainty dessert.

spoonful of soda; or one pint of sweet milk and ohe heaping tea- 
spoonful of baking powder, one tablespoonful of lard, a pinch of 
salt. Stir in white meal enough to make a batter the consist-

tablespoonful of allspice, one-half tablespoonful of cloves, one 
tablespoonful of pepper, one-half tablespoonful of salt and one 
pint of vinegar. Boil until a little thick, and bottle. Splendid for

cellent for this purpose. Add to the meat a little chopped cel- 
ery, one-half of a small onion, chopped fine; some minced par- 



460 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

sley and one teaspoonful of salt. Put into a pan three tablespoon- 
fuls of flour and two tablespoonfuls of butter. Set on the stove 
and stir until melted. Add gradually three-fourths cup of rich milk, 
next add three-fourths cup of stock. Stir until the mixture is the 
consistency of thick cream. Pour this over the seasoned meat; mix 
thoroughly and set aside until cold. When used for breakfast let 
it stand mixed over night. When thoroughly cold, mold with 
the hands into any desired shape. Roll in cracker crumbs; then 
in well-beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs and drop into boil- 
ing fat, a few at a time, until rich-brown color is obtained. This 
is an economic, delicious breakfast dish. 

Creamed Potatoes, with Cheese — Peel five ordinary-sized po- 
tatoes and cut into small cubes. Boil until tender; pour off 
the water and season with a generous half-cup of milk, one table- 
spoonful of butter, half-teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pepper. 
Cover over with grated cheese. Set in the oven to brown, and 
serve quickly. 

Scalloped Salsify, or Oyster Plant— Boil the salsify till ten- 
der; peel and cut crosswise in slices half an inch in thickness. 
Grease the bottom of a baking-dish and cover with the salsify. 
Sprinkle over this a little salt, pepper and bits of butter. Add a 
layer of cracker crumbs; then a layer of salsify, seasoned as be- 
fore. Let the thin top layer be of cracker crumbs. Pour over 
milk enough to fairly cover it and bake. 

Tomato Salad — Select medium-sized ripe tomatoes. Peel 
carefully and scoop out the center. Set on ice to chill. When 
ready to serve fill the cavity with chopped celery and chopped 
nuts (not too fine). Cover with a tablespoonful of salad dress- 
ing. Serve on lettuce leaves or sprigs of parsley or the ends of 
the celery. 

Prune Souffle — Steam eighteen prunes till soft; remove the 
stones and chop very fine. Add to this one cup of pulverized 
sugar. Have beaten very stiff the whites of eight eggs. Add this 
to the fruit and flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla extract. 
Butter a baking-dish and bake in a very cool oven for thirty min- 
utes. Serve cold with whipped cream. 

Cheese Balls — To one cup of grated stale cheese add one- 
third of a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of red pepper and a pinch 
of celery salt. Beat the whites of two eggs stiff; mix together. 
Mold with the hands into balls the size of walnuts. Drop two 
at a time into a kettle of boiling lard. With a silver fork or wire 
spoon keep the balls constantly in motion; if allowed to rest on 
the bottom of the kettle they will pull apart and stick. A mo- 
ment is sufficient time to brown them if the lard is boiling. 
Place on ordinary wrapping paper for an instant, and then serve 
piping hot with coffee. Miss Florence Clayton.

Oyster Saute — Two dozen large, or three dozen small oysters; 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, four of fine cracker crumbs. Let 
the oysters drain in the colander. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, 
and roll in the crumbs. Have the butter very hot in a frying-pan 
and put in enough of the oysters to cover the bottom ©f the pan. 
Fry crisp and brown, being careful not to burn. Serve on hot, 
crisp toast. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes — Take eight good-sized cold-boiled pota- 
toes. Slice them endwise, making them like dice. Heat some 
good drippings in a frying-pan, fry in it one small onion, chopped 
fine, until it begins to change color and look yellow. Put in the 
potatoes, sprinkle well with salt and pepper, stir well and cook 
about five minutes, taking care not to break them. They must 
not brown. Before taking up stir in a tablespoonful of minced 
parsley. Drain dry by shaking in a heated colander. Serve very 
hot. 

Graham Griddle Cakes — Two cupfuls of graham, one of flour, 
two and one-half of milk, one tablespoonful of sugar, one tea- 
spoonful of salt, one of cream of tartar, half a teaspoonful of 
soda, two eggs. Let half the milk come to a boil. Pour on the 
graham and stir until perfectly smooth; then add the cold milk 
and set away to cool. Mix the other dry ingredients with the 
flour and rub through a sieve. Add, with the eggs well beaten, to 
the graham and milk. Fry like griddle cakes. 

Fillet of Tongue — Cut cold-boiled tongue in pieces about four 
inches long, two wide and half an inch thick; dip in melted butter 
and flour. For eight fillets put two tablespoonfuls of butter in the 



462 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

frying-pan, and when hot put in the tongue. Brown on both sides. 
Take up and put one more tablespoonful of flour in the pan and 
then one heaping teaspoonful of flour. Stir until dark brown; then 
add one cupful of stock or water, half a teaspoonful of parsley 
and one tablespoonful of lemon juice or one teaspoonful of vine- 
gar. Boil up once and pour it around the tongue, which has been 
dished on thin strips of toast. Garnish with parsley and serve. 
At the last moment stir into the sauce a tablespoonful of chopped 
pickles or capers. 

Jelly Fritters — Make a batter of two eggs, a pint of milk and a 
pint bowl of flour; beat it light. Put a tablespoonful of lard or 
beef drippings in a frying-pan, add a saltspoonful of salt, making 
it boiling hot. Put in the batter by the large spoonful, not too 
close. When one side is a delicate brown, turn the other. When 
done, place them on a dish with a doiley over it. Put a dessert- 
spoonful of jelly on each. 

Gumbo Soup — Try out the fat of a slice of bacon, drain it off, 
and in it fry the slices of a large onion brown. Peel and cut up 
two quarts of fresh tomatoes, and cut thin one quart of okra. 
Put all together with a little chopped parsley (one teaspoonful) in 
a stew kettle with three quarts of hot broth of any kind. Let it 
cook slowly for three hours. Season with a scant tablespoonful 
of salt and half a teaspoonful of pepper. In the winter a large 
can of tomatoes and a can of okra may be used instead of the 
fresh vegetables. 

Baked Mutton Cutlets — Prepare the cutlets as for frying by 
dipping them in beaten egg and rolled cracker crumbs. Lay them 
in a dripping pan with very little water at the bottom. Sprinkle 
with pepper and salt, and baste often with butter and water. Make 
a little brown gravy and turn over them when they are served. 

Compote of Pears — Select flrm fruit, not too ripe. Wash them 
and cut them into halves lengthwise, and carefully take out the 
core. Make a sirup in the proportion of two cups of sugar to one 
of water. When the sirup is boiling, put in the pieces of pears 
and cook them till tender. Take them out with a skimmer and 
arrange them in a pyramid form, the stem end up, on a pretty 
dish. Slice an unpeeled lemon very thin and put in the sirup. Let 
the sirup cook until it thickens. Put the lemon slices over the 
fruit and pour the sirup over all by the spoonful when a little 
cool. Place the compote where it will become perfectly cold, and 
serve. Mrs. John Buie.

Ragout of Liver — Heat three teaspoonfuls of nice dripping in 
a frying-pan; add an onion sliced, a tablespoonful of chopped 
parsley and thrice as much minced bacon; when all are hissing 
hot lay in one-half of a liver cut in pieces as long and wide as your 
middle finger and fry brown, turning often. Take out the liver 
and keep hot; strain the gravy, rinse off the frying-pan and re- 
turn to the fire with the gravy and an even tablespoonful of but- 
ter worked up well in two of brown flour. Stir until you have a 
smooth browned cream; thin gradually with half a cupful of 
boiling water; add the juice of half a lemon, a teaspoonful of 
minced pickle and a scant half-teaspoonful of curry powder wet 
with cold water. Boil sharply; pour over the liver; set over 
pan of boiling water closely covered for ten minutes before 
serving. 

Chipped Beef, with Tomatoes — Cut up five tomatoes and dust 
over with flour; put a tablespoonful of butter into a pan, and 
when melted add the tomatoes, stirring smooth. Let cook five 
minutes. Have half a pound of dry beef chipped very thin (and 
if not too salt will season just right); add to the tomatoes; let 
simmer gently a few minutes longer and serve. 

Cucumber Pickle — Chop three cucumbers fine, add a piece of 
a red pepper the size of a silver dollar, also chopped fine; add a 
teaspoonful of salt, half a teaspoonful of celery seed, three table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar; mix all well together. This will keep sev- 
eral days, and is very nice. 

Peach Flummery — Pare and quarter enough ripe, juicy peaches 
to make a pint, put on to stew in one pint of water, a teacupful of 
sugar; let cook until tender without breaking. Mix three table- 
spoonfuls of cornstarch in a little cold water and add to peaches, 
stirring constantly. Cook five minutes, then turn into a mold 
and set away to cool. Eat with cream and sugar, if more is 
liked. 

Plain Cake — One-half cupful of butter, two cupfuls of sugar, 
two eggs, one cup of milk, three cupfuls of flour, one-fourth tea- 
spoonful of salt, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder; 
cream the butter and sugar; add beaten eggs and salt; 
alternately add milk and flour with baking powder. Mix 
one teaspoonful of cinnamon and three of pulverized 



464 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

sugar and sift on top. Can be baked in dripping pans if preferred. 
Bake in moderate oven. 

Virginia Stew— A medium-sized chicken, cut as for frying; a 
potato for each member of the family, two ears of corn 
cut from the cob, a generous handful of lima beans, three 
nice round tomatoes, one teaspoonful of salt, quarter as much 
pepper. The chicken is first parboiled and then the vegetables 
added, and the whole simmered an hour and a half longer. About 
a quart of water is needed. Serve in a deep platter. The only 
vegetable used with this stew is a dish of boiled rice. This is a 
Virginia concoction, and very palatable, too. 

Grape Sherbet— Lay a square of cheesecloth over a bowl; put 
in a pound of ripe Concord grapes; mash very thoroughly with a 
wooden masher. Squeeze out all the juice; add an equal amount 
of cold water, the juice of one lemon, and sugar to make it very 
sweet. Freeze as usual. This is the most delightful of all water 
ices. There will be sufficient cake left from luncheon.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 465 

Fried Ham and Eggs — Cut slices of Ijam quite thin; cut off 
the rind or skin; put them into a frying-pan, turning them often 
until crisp, taking care not to burn the slices; three minutes wiU 
cook them v/ell. Dish them on a hot platter; then turn off the 
grease, rinse out the pan and put back the clear grease to fry the 
eggs. Break the eggs separately in a saucer, that in case a bad 
one may be among them it may not mix with the rest. Slip each 
egg gently into the frying-pan; do not turn them while frying, 
but keep pouring some of the hot lard over them with the kitchen 
spoon; this will do them sufficiently on the upper side. They 
will be done enough in about three minutes. The white must 
retain its transparency so that the yolk will be seen through it; 
when done, take them up with a skimmer, drain off the lard, and 
if any part of the white is discolored or ragged, trim it off. Lay 
a fried egg upon each slice of the ham, and send to the table hot. 
Salt will hardly be needed, and if pepper is used a slight sprinkle 
will be sufficient. 

Chile Sauce — To nine large, ripe tomatoes and three green 
peppers add one onion chopped fine, two cupfuls of vinegar, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and one of salt. Steam one hour; then 
add one teaspoonful of ginger, one of allspice and one of cloves. 

Banana Pie — Beat the yolks of two eggs to a cream with 
one-half cupful of sugar; add one and a half cupfuls of sweet 
milk. Peel and mash two large bananas or three small ones; 
sift them and add to the other ingredients. Bake with one crust, 
and when done cover with a meringue made of two whites of 
eggs and three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Serve cold. 

Steamed Pish — Secure the tail of the fish in its mouth so as 
to curve the body in a circle; pour over it a half pint of vinegar 
seasoned with a little pepper and a dessert spoon of salt; let it 
stand an hour in a cool place; pour off the vinegar, and put fish 
in a steamer over boiling water and steam twenty minutes, or 
longer for a large fish. When the meat easily separates from the 
bone it is done. Drain well and serve on a white napkin, neatly 
folded and placed on the platter; decorate the napkin around the 
fish with sprigs of curled parsley. 

Scotch Scones — Thoroughly mix, while dry, one quart of sifted 
flour, loosely measured, with two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder; then rub into it a tablespoonful of cold butter and a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Be sure the butter is well worked in; add 
sweet milk enough to make a very soft paste. Roll out the paste 
about a quarter of an inch thick, using plenty of flour on the 
paste-board and rolling-pin. Cut into triangular pieces, each side 
about four inches long. Flour the sides and bottom of a biscuit 
tin and place the pieces on it. Bake immediately in a quick oven, 
from twenty to thirty minutes. When done brush over with 
sweet milk. 

Peach Custard — Line the bottom of a pudding dish with pared 
and halved free-stone peaches, cavities up. Fill these with soft 
sugar. Make a rich cornstarch custard, stir over the fire until 



466 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

quite thick and pour over the peaches. Cover with a thick 
meringue, which lightly brown. Serve very hot. 

Cornstarch Custard — Two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch to one 
quart of milk; mix the cornstarch with a small quantity of the 
milk and flavor it; beat up two eggs. Heat remainder of the milk 
to near boiling, then add the mixed cornstarch, the eggs, four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, a little butter and a pinch of salt. Boil 
two minutes, stirring it briskly. 

Sweet Pickled Pears — Boil together for fifteen minutes one 
pint of cider vinegar, one and three-fourths pounds of granulated 
sugar. Tie in a small piece of cheese cloth half a dozen whole 
cloves, one dozen whole allspice, one teaspoonful of ground cin- 
namon and one saltspoonfui of ground mace, and a small piece of 
ginger root. Put with the vinegar and boil. Select fine, large 
seckel pears, pare and remove the stems; then put into the vine- 
gar as many as will be nicely covered. Let all boil gently until 
the pears look clear, then drain off the vinegar, put the pears into, 
jars, reheat the vinegar and pour over the pears. Seal if desired 
for winter use. This is a delicious pickle if properly and care- 
fully made. ■ Mrs. Maude K. Cameron.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 467 

Bread Pancakes — Remove the crust from stale bread and 
break in crumbs, enougli to make one pint; dampen in cold water 
and let stand over night. In the morning add one beaten egg, one 
pint of sour milk, two scant teaspoonfuls of soda, dissolved in a 
tablespoonful of warm water, half a teaspoonful of salt and half 
a cupful of flour. Bake on a hot griddle. 

Noodled Ham — Make the noodles by beating one egg with a 
saltspoon of salt, till very light; add as much flour as it v/ill re- 
quire to make a very stiff dough (eggs vary in size, so an exact 
amount cannot be given), roll very thin and cut in narrow strips; 
roll these between the hands till round like "shoe-strings," and 
break in pieces an inch or two in length; when dry put two cup- 
fuls of them in a stew-pan and pour over enough boiling water to 
just cover them; let boil ten minutes. Chop enough cold boiled 
ham to make one large coffee cupful. (In slicing ham one can 
save all the crumbs and small pieces that are trimmed from the 
bone.) Butter an earthen dish; put in a layer of the noodles 
(after carefully draining them), then a layer of the ham, another 
layer of noodles, finishing with ham for top layer. Beat two eggs, 
and add one coffee cupful of cream or rich milk and pour over the 
top; cover with a thin layer of grated bread crumbs and little 
dots of butter. Bake a delicate brown. Serve in the dish in 
which it is baked. 

Brown Bread Sandwiches — Cut small round loaves of brown 
bread in very thin slices; spread with butter and a sprinkling of 
grated cheese; put two slices together and cut in two. 

Pried Peaches — Pare and cut in halves five peaches; put a 
tablespoonful of butter in a frying-pan, place the peaches in with 
the pit side down. When they begin to brown turn and fill the holes 
with sugar; cook till tender. Serve on a hot platter. 

Caramel Cake — Rub one scant half-cupful of butter to a 
cream; gradually add two cupfuls of granulated sugar; mix till 
white and creamy; add one cupful of milk, three cupfuls of sifted 
fiour with two heaping teaspoonfuls of baking powder and the 
whites of four eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Bake in three layers. 

For the caramel filling take two cupfuls of "yellow C" sugar, 
one tablespoonful of butter and one cupful of thin cream or rich 
milk, though cream is better. Put all in a granite stew-pan and 
cook about three-quarters of an hour; when thick remove from 
the range and add two teaspoonfuls of vanilla. Stir till cool. Put 
between layers and on top. A white frosting may be put over all 
if liked. 

Veal Pot-Pie with Potatoes — Get a knuckle or brisket of veal 
weighing about three pounds; wash and put in a granite kettle, 
with enough boiling water to more than cover it. Watch care- 
fully and remove all scum as it rises; when nearly tender put in 
a large spoonful of butter, two level teaspoonfuls of salt and half 
a teaspoonful of pepper. (If the salt is put in at first it toughens 
it.) When nearly done put in five potatoes cut in halves. Make 
a batter of one and a half pints of fiour, two teaspoonfuls of bak- 
ing powder, a saltspoonful of salt and a large cupful of sweet

milk. Drop a spoonful at a time either on the meat or in a 
steamer placed over the kettle. Do not remove the cover for 
thirty minutes, for if the air strikes them they will fall. Take up 
the meat, potatoes and dumplings on a large platter. Wet two 
teaspoonfuls of flour in a little cold water and rub till smooth and 
stir into the gravy; add another teaspoonful of butter, and cook 
till it thickens. Pour over the pot-pie and send to the table at 
once. 

Peach Ambrosia — Bake a small sponge cake of one-half a cup- 
ful of sugar, two eggs, a pinch of salt, one teaspoonful of baking- 
powder sifted in one-half a cupful of flour; stir flour in lightly 
and add one tablespoonful of hot water just before putting in the 
oven. Bake in a square tin. When cold take out on a platter or 
ice-cream dish and cover v/ith thinly sliced peaches, a small tea- 
spoonful of sugar and a cupful of whipped cream.

Stir one cupful of hominy into one quart of freshly boiling water, 
first put in the water one level teaspoonful of salt. Boil one 
hour. Serve with milk. 

Broiled Mackerel— Soak salt mackerel over night, drain, wipe

sides. Take up, dredge with pepper and pour over melted butter. 

Southern Spoon Cornbread— Pour a pint of boiling water over 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 469 

one cupful of cornmeal and boil five minutes, stirring constantly. 
Add one teaspoonful of melted butter, two well-beaten eggs, one 
cupful of water, one cupful of milk, and one teaspoonful of salt. 
Pour into a greased baking dish and bake half an hour in a slow 
oven. Leave in dish and serve with a spoon. This is one of the 
best of cornbreads. 

Fricasseed Eggs — Boil six eggs hard, cut in half crosswise 
and take out the yolks. Rub these to a paste with two table- 
spoonfuls of finely minced ham or cold fowl (if the latter is 
used add a half- teaspoonful of salt), one tablespoonful minced 
parsley, one teaspoonful of melted iDutter and a saltspoonful of 
made mustard. Work well together and fill the whites with it, 
setting them close to each other in a deep-covered dish, the open 
ends up. Heat to boiling one cupful of veal or chicken broth, 
with half a teaspoonful of parsley, saltspoonful of salt and a 
quarter of the same of pepper, and lastly three tablespoonfuls of 
cream. Boil up, pour over the eggs, let them stand five minutes 
closely covered before sending to the table. The dish is "delect- 
able."

cupful of butter, one cupful of cream, one pineapple, grated. 
Beat the butter and sugar to a cream, add the beaten yolks of the 
eggs, then the pineapple and cream and lastly the beaten whites 
whipped in lightly. Bake with undercrust only. 

Eggplant Soup — Pare and cut into small pieces two of the 
"eggs;" let them lie in salted water for an hour; remove from 
this to the soup kettle, adding two quarts of water, and boil un- 
til tender. Thicken with one tablespoonful of flour rubbed into 
the same quantity of butter, one level teaspoonful of salt, one 
saltspoonful of pepper and a cupful of cream (milk will answer). 
Serve with crackers. 

Virginia Smothered Chicken — Split a tender chicken down 
the back; season it with a teaspoonful of salt and a quarter tea- 
spoonful of pepper; put it into a dripping-pan with a cupful of 
hot water, and place it in the oven until it is tender. As soon 
as it begins to brown, make a paste of two tablespoonfuls each 
of butter and flour and spread over the chicken, and baste it 
every ten minutes with the drippings in the pan until brown. 
Set the pan containing the drippings over the fire; pour into it 
a cupful of rich milk; stir until it boils; season with saltspoonful 
of salt, one-half of pepper; pour this gravy over the chicken and 
serve it hot. 

Scalloped Sweet Potatoes — Boil three sweet potatoes in slight- 
ly salted water, peel and slice lengthwise. Arrange a layer of 
the slices in the bottom of a deep baking-pan; spread with but- 
ter and sugar; put in more potatoes, butter and sugar until the 
pan is full. Set in a hot oven until brown. Serve in the dish 
in which the potatoes are cooked. 

Stewed Okra, with Tomatoes — Wash one dozen pods of okra 
and slice them thin. Peel three tomatoes and cut into slices; 
put in a granite sauce-pan; add a large saltspoonful of salt; 



470 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

cover and set over the fire to simmer slowly for half an hour. 
Add a tablespoonful of butter, with a dash of cayenne, and serve. 

Orange Roly-Poly — This is always hailed with delight, the 
"windfalls" of the orange groves being called into requisition. 
Make a soft dough with one pint of flour, one tablespoonful of 
lard, one saltspoonful of salt, mixed with sufficient cold water to 
make it stick together. Roll in an oblong sheet and lay thickly 
over it three oranges that have been peeled, sliced and seeded; 
sprinkle liberally with white sugar; scatter a teaspoonful of the 
grated yellow rind over all and roll up closely, folding the ends 
to secure the sirup, and tie in a well-floured cloth, leaving plenty 
of room for it to swell. Put it into a pot of boiling water and 
boil two hours, or it may be steamed two hours and a half. Serve 
with lemon sauce. 

Lemon Sauce — Beat together one cupful of sugar, two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, two tablespoonfuls of flour, and pour over it 
one pint of boiling water. Stir to a smooth liquid and add the

tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, two tablespoonfuls of brown 
sugar and three tablespoonfuls of flour; then put into the center 
two tablespoonfuls of butter and pour over the butter a half- 
pint of scalded milk. Beat up well; then add another half-pint 
of cold milk and two even teaspoonfuls of baking powder, a 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 471 

small teaspoonful of salt, and two eggs, well beaten. Pour into 
greased gem pans and bake in a hot oven thirty minutes. 

Coffee — Put into a French coffee-pot one heaping tablespoon- 
ful of ground coffee for each person; pour over it very slowly 
one cupful of water, boiling hot, for each spoonful of coffee. 

Baked Pears — Fill a moderate-sized baking dish with whole 
pears; wipe them, but do not remove the stems. Pour around 
them one large cup of boiling water, add two tablespoonfuls of 
light-brown sugar, bake slowly until the pears are tender, bast- 
ing frequenty with the liquor. Serve cold, with sugar and cream, 
if desired. 

Cream of Barley — Scald two tablespoonfuls of barley, drain, 
cover with fresh boiling v/ater and, boil three hours. Strain, 
Put one pint of milk and one pmt of veal stock on to boil; add 
the barley, salt and pepper to taste. Beat two yolks lightly; 
pour them into soup tureen, pour over the boiling soup and serve 
at once. 

Baked Ham — Wash the ham well in cold water. Put into 
large boiler nearly filled with cold water, add six cloves and a 
bay leaf. Place it over a slow fire, that it may heat gradually. 
Simmer gently fifteen minutes to every pound, skimming care- 
fully from time to time. Allow it to cool in the liquor, then re- 
move the rind carefully. Brush it over with a beaten egg and 
sprinkle with bread-crumbs. Place in a quick oven for about 
fifteen minutes to brown. Serve hot. 

Sweet Potatoes in Molasses — Boil two pounds of sweet pota- 
toes until they can be peeled, then put them into a pan or dish, 
spread a little butter, then a little molasses over each one, set 
in the oven and brown a light brown. These are delicious and 
quite worth a trial. 

Rennet Custard — Sweeten and flavor with vanilla one quart 
of sweet milk; put into pan or dish in which it is to be served, 
grate a little nutmeg over the top, lastly stir gently one table- 
spoonful of rennet through the mixture, stand in the kitchen until 
it thickens, v/hen it should be placed in the ice-chest until very 
cold. This pudding should be made about an hour and a half 
before serving. The rennet (liquid) may be be bought of a drug- 
gist, 25 cents a bottle, which, if kept in a cool place, will last a 
great while. Sweetened and flavored cream as a sauce is of 
course an improvement. Miss Martha Milson.

drain and cover onion with two cupfuls of milk, add two cloves 
and a quarter-teaspoonful of salt, and simmer half an hour. Rub 
through a sieve, pressing through as much of the onion as possi- 
ble. Put one heaping tablespoonful of butter and one of flour 
in a sauce-pan, and when melted and mixed add the milk and 
onion and stir until smooth; add half a cup of stale bread crumbs, 
a quarter-teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of white pepper, 
and a dash of mace; turn into a baking dish, slip in carefully five 
eggs and put in a very hot oven until the eggs are set. 

Deviled Toast — Use whole wheat or brown bread which is at 
least one day old; cut in thin slices and toast slowly until a 
golden brown. Spread with butter to each tablespoonful of which 
has been added one-quarter of a teaspoonful of dry mustard, 
one-quarter of a teaspoonful of paprika and ten 
drops of onion juice. Dust with a little grated cheese and set in 
a hot oven for three minutes. 

Junket — Place a quart of milk on the stove until it is luke- 
warm, then pour into some pretty dish, sweeten with two table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar and flavor to taste with essence of 
vanilla, lemon or strawberry, then add, stirring slightly, three- 
quarters of a tablespoonful of rennet. Place on ice or in a cool 
place until cold. 

Tomato Soup— One quart of soup stock, two cupfuls of to- 
iuato. Cut a small onion in pieces and fry slightly. Put the to- 
matoes and soup stock and onion on the fire together. Add one 
cupful of milk, a teaspoonful of butter, a dash of cayenne, a tea- 
spoonful of sugar and a saltspoonful of salt. Strain, thicken 
with a tablespoonful of flour made in a paste with water, and 
serve hot, with croutons.

beef and veal, trim off all fat and gristle and chop very fine. 
Add one-half of a teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter of a teaspoon- 
ful of paprika, one-quarter of a teaspoonful of mixed sv/eet herbs, 
one teaspoonful of chopped parsley and one of chopped onion. 
Stir in one well-beaten egg and set aside until the next day; 
then form into steaks and fry quickly in butter. Serve on a hot 
platter, with mashed potatoes in the center and brov/n gravy in a 
sauceboat. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 473 

Celery and Carrots — Cut the celery into short pieces and the 
carrots into thin slices; have the same amount of each. Boil 
the carrots in slightly salted water until tender, then drain. 
Scald the celery in another dish; add the carrots and half a pint 
of sweet milk. Thicken with a teaspoonful of cornstarch stirred 
into some of the milk, season with a teaspoonful of salt, a salt- 
spoonful of pepper and a teaspoonful of hutter; bring to a boil 
and serve. 

Apple Pudding — Peel, core and slice suflacient apples to fill a 
baking dish, butter the dish thickly and put in the apples in 
layers, alternating them with stale cake crumbs and a little 
melted butter, using two tablespoonfuls of the latter to a pint of 
apples. Let the last layer be a thick one of cake crumbs; put in 
a moderately hot oven until the apples are tender, then beat to- 
gether two eggs and two tablespoonfuls of sugar (more should 
be used if apples are very tart), add one cupful of milk and pour 
over the apples. Bake a rich golden color and serve with cream.

Lay fish on this with half-slice of lemon to each. Serve with let- 
tuce and vinegar.

celery salt, one-half cup milk. Mix, fill patty pans and bake

ture, return to the oven and cook until the tops are brown. 

Tomato Preserves — Select sound, yellow, pear-shaped to- 
matoes; wash and prick with a needle to prevent their bursting. 
Put their weight in sugar over them. Let stand over night.

476 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Hashed Potatoes — Take six cold-boiled potatoes; mince them 
and season with a half-teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of pep- 
per, adding one-half cupful of milk or stock. Melt a tablespoon- 
ful of butter in an omelet pan, and when it is very hot pour in 
the potatoes. Spread evenly and set back where they will brown, 
then fold over like an omelet and serve. A little minced parsley 
or onion improves the dish. 

Mock Terrapin — Season one-half of a calf's liver with a 
small teaspoonful of salt, and fry slowly until brown; then cut 
it into small dice and dredge with flour. Add to it one teaspoon- 
ful of mixed mustard, two finely chopped, hard-boiled eggs, two 
gills of boiling water, a saltspoonful of pepper and two ounces 
of butter. Let this boil three minutes, then add one-half a gill 
of lemon juice and serve very hot. 

Beef Tea — To one pound of raw round steak, freed from fat 
and finely minced, add four drops of hydrochloric acid. Put it 
into a fruit jar and set the jar into a kettle of cold water over a 
slow fire, and let it boil gently for three hours. Strain through 
a coarse strainer. Season with a half-teaspoonful of salt. As 
the most nutritive portion of the meat precipitates in the prepa- 
ration do not strain too closely or exclude the sediment from the 
beef tea. 

Stewed Mushrooms — Drop the mushrooms as cleaned into 
water made slightly acid with vinegar. Drain, slice thin, and to 
every quart add half a teacupful of cold water, a teaspoonful of 
salt and a dash of pepper. Simmer five minutes; add a table- 
spoonful of butter rubbed into a tablespoonful of flour. Remove 
as soon as it bubbles. 

Spanish Fruit Pudding — Line a baking dish with a light puff 
of paste, add a layer of sliced peaches, a layer of sweet oranges, 
sliced, and a layer of sliced bananas. Strew two tablespoonfuls 
of sugar between each layer. Cover the dish with a light puff 
of paste and bake to a delicate brown. Use eight or ten peaches, 
three oranges and four bananas. Delicious. 

Mrs. M. A. Rowan. 

No. 227 Fairview Place, Waukegan, 111. 



October brings the mushroom, and few people are acquainted 
with its indescribable, delicious flavor. For 15 cents one can buy 
an abundance for a family of flve. If necessary do without some 
other luxury and give the mushroom a good trial this month.

DINNER.

Baked sweet potatoes. Fresh bread. 

Mrs. Thompson's carrot pudding. 

Coffee or tea. 



Seven-Minute Eggs — Pour boiling water upon the eggs, and 
let them stand seven minutes on the back of the stove. Prepared 
in this manner they will keep of a pleasant, soft consistency for 
several minutes longer, either in the water, or under egg-cosies. 

Stewed Green Tomatoes — Six large green tomatoes, pared; 
three good-sized onions, peeled. Slice the onions very thin into a 
spider in which has been melted a tablespoonful of fat. Let the 
onions fry five or six minutes, taking care that they do not burn; 
then sprinkle a good teaspoonful of salt and half a teaspoonful 
of black pepper upon them, mixing well. Slice the pared green 
tomatoes into the spider and add half a teacupful of hot water. 
Stir all together and let stew under cover about ten minutes, or 
until tomatoes are soft. Add a heaping tablespoonful of butter, 
and serve in hot dish. 

Scotch Shortcake — Scotch shortcake is simply good pie-crust 
rolled out and spread with butter, sugar and a dusting of cinna- 
mon; folded over, and the butter, sugar and cinnamon repeated 
on top. Bake in a quick oven from ten to fifteen minutes. Very 
nice for luncheon. 

Dutch Cocoa — The Dutch cocoas are best prepared by mixing 
thoroughly equal parts of cocoa and sugar, and pouring absolutely 
boiling water upon the mixture, in the proportion of one teacup- 
ful water to two teaspoonfuls of the mixture. A little milk or 
cream is added to each cup when serving. The cocoa may be made 
directly in the cups, or in chocolate pot. It is equally delicious, 
either way. 

Clear Soup, ^ la Vienne — Take three pints good soup stock, 
and add to it a small onion and half a small carrot, which have 
been parboiled five minutes. Add a bay leaf, two kernels of all- 
spice, a heaping teaspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonful of 
black pepper, a tiny pinch of red pepper, and a half 
a teaspoonful of minute shavings of the outer peel of 
a lemon. Boil thirty minutes and strain. Return it to the 
kettle, and drop into it, when again boiling, small tablespoonfuls 
of the following mixture: 

One egg well beaten, one tablespoonful lard beaten into the 
egg, and three tablespoonfuls farina. Stir all thoroughly before 



in THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOkL 

dropping into the boiling soup. Let boil scarcely three minutes, 
and serve. A pleasant and unique addition to soup, somewhat 
resembling the roe of small fish. 

Old Cornish Meat Pie — Two squabs, or young pigeons; four 
large, tart apples; four good-sized onions; one and one-half 
pounds lean mutton or lamb. 

Cut the mutton in small pieces and simmer for an hour and 
a half in a quart of water, with one teaspoonful salt, and a couple 
of peppercorns. 

Line a deep pudding dish around the sides only, with a crust 
composed of a pint of sifted flour, one-fourth pound of beef suet 
chopped very fine, one-half teaspoonful salt, and nearly a tea- 
cupful of cold water. Leave enough of the crust to cover the top 
with a rather thick layer. 

Prepare the squabs, wash, and wipe them dry, rub them in- 
side and out with salt and pepper and lay them in the bottom of 
the pudding dish. 

Cover the squabs with alternate layers of sliced apple, sliced 
onion, and bits of mutton, occasionally dredging in a very little 
flour, and laying a few bits of butter. Continue the layers until 
the dish is heaping full, and pour into it the water in which the 
mutton was stewed. Roll out the top crust, cut crisscross slits for 
ventilation, lay it over the pie, fastening the edges well against 
the lining crust. Bake one hour in a quick oven, taking care that 
the top crust does not burn. It is best served in the dish in which 
it is baked. A Cornish dish, which, once learned, is much liked. 

"Happy is the family that can eat onions together!" — Old 
Proverb. 

Mrs. Thompson's Carrot Pudding — One-half pound bread 
crumbs, one-fourth pound stoned raisins, one-fourth pound cur- 
rants, three-fourths pound boiled and mashed carrot, one cup 
sugar, three well-beaten eggs, one-fourth grated nutmeg, one 
half cup milk, one-half teaspoonful salt. 

Boil the carrots and mash them fine, add the other ingredients, 
mix well and put in a buttered pudding dish. Bake one hour. 
Turn it out of dish and serve with cream and sifted sugar. It is 
also very nice when cold, and can then be sliced.

Cracked Wheat — To four small cups of boiling water stir in 
one cup of cracked wheat and scant teaspoonful of salt. Boil in 
double boiler two hours; serve hot or pour into a mold and serve 
cold, with cream and sugar. Prepare this the day before. 

Creamed Cod in Potato Case — Boil and mash six potatoes; 
add one egg, a gill of milk, half a teaspoonful of salt and a drift 
of pepper; beat all until very light. Pick and scald three-quarters 
of a pound of boneless cod; drain and press perfectly dry. Mix 
one tablespoonful of butter and two of flour; add one pint of 
milk and stir on stove until boiling, adding a half-saltspoon of 
pepper. Grease a small pudding dish; line the bottom and sides 
with the potatoes. Add the cod to the cream sauce and fill in the 
center; cover the top with a thick layer of mashed potatoes and 
bake until a nice brown. When done turn out and serve. 

Egg Bread — Two cups of yellow meal, one cup of cold boiled 
rice, three well-beaten eggs, one tablespoonful of melted butter, 
a teaspoonful of salt and two cups of milk. Stir the beaten eggs 
into the milk; add the meal, butter, salt and lastly the rice; beat 
hard three minutes; add two teaspoonfuls of baking powder and 
bake quickly in a shallow pan. 

Doughnuts — Sift three times two teaspoonfuls of baking pow- 
der in one quart of flour. Dissolve half a cup of sugar in one cup 
of milk; add a teaspoonful of salt, a half of a grated nutmeg and 
two well-beaten eggs. Mix with the flour; handle as little as 
possible; roll out; cut with a ring-cutter and fry. This makes 
enough for three meals. 

Sausage Toast — Pry five link sausages; strip off the skins and 
mix with a tablespoonful of scalded parsley, chopped very fine, 
a grating of good cheese, such as Parmesan, and a tablespoonful 
of mixed mustard; spread the mixture on hot-buttered toast. 

Cider Jelly — Soften one ounce of gelatine in half a pint of cold 
water. When quite soft add half a pint of hot water and a pint 
of good, sparkling cider. If the cider be very sweet the juice of a 
lemon is an improvement. 

Fayal Biscuit — Take three cups of fiour, one cup of milk, three 
eggs, half a cup of sugar, butter the size of an egg and three 
spoonfuls of powder. Blend the butter and sugar; add the beaten 
egg, then the milk; sift the flour and fold into the other ingre-

celery instead. Arrange in the salad bowl in layers of potatoes, 
eggs and minced onion, adding salt and pepper to each layer and

vinegar and egg when cold. Mix lightly and pour over potatoes. 
Do not stir after adding to potatoes. 

Noodle Soup — Three pints or more of good stock seasoned 
with salt and pepper. Add one-half hour before seasoning noodles 
made of one egg, slightly beaten with one tablespoonful of water, 
a saltspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper and mixed as solid 
as possible with flour, rolled to paper-like thinness, dried at least 
one hour, and cut in pieces one-half inch square. One-quarter of

Stewed Shoulder of Veal — Remove the bone from the shoul- 
der and stuff the cavity left with a cupful of bread crumbs sea- 
soned with a teaspoonful of sage, a saltspoon of salt and one-half 
a saltspoon of pepper, slightly moistened with a tablespoonful of 
water or milk. Cover the top of the meat with thin slices of cold 
cooked fat bacon or salt pork, fastening them in place. Put the meat 
into a pot with two quarts of boiling water, a chopped onion and 
two stalks of celery; add a heaping teaspoonful of salt, cover and 
stir gently for two hours. Remove the meat to a dripping-pan, 
brush over with a raw egg, sift rolled cracker crumbs over it, and 
set in the oven for half an hour; when well browned serve on a 
hot dish. Strain the liquor in which it was cooked, thicken with 
a large spoonful of browned flour, boiling briskly for five min- 
utes, and send to table in a gravy-boat. 

Savory Baked Potatoes — Peel as many medium-sized potatoes 
as will cover the bottom of a large baking dish. Sprinkle over 
them a half -teaspoonful of dried sage, half a teaspoonful of salt 
and a saltspoonful of pepper. Cut an onion in thin slices and

of flour, one and one-half cupfuls sugar, six tablespoonfuls dry 
mustard, one tablespoonful turmeric powder. Mix all together;

water. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 485

cold water and soak over night. Drain the juice from a quart jar 
of cherries, add sufficient water to the juice to make one pint, pour

until perfectly clear and done. Then add the cherries and a cup- 
ful of sugar (or more if the cherries are very sour) ; stir all to- 
gether thoroughly, pour into a pudding dish, and bake one-half

saltspoonful of salt and one-half of a saltspoonful of pepper. 
Beat with a Dover eggbeater or fork until light. Then add four 
tablespoonfuls of milk. Beat the whites until stiff and fold, not 
beat them, into the yolks, so that the whole shall be very 
light and puffy. Pour the mixture into a buttered pan and cook 
slowly until the underside begins to turn brown, or for about two 
minutes. Then put the pan on the grate in the oven for about 
one minute or a little longer, to cook the upper surface. Have 



486 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

ready broiled a thin, small slice of ham, thoroughly well done. 
Run a knife under the omelet to separate it from the pan, lay 
the ham lightly on one half of it and fold over it the other. Take

spoonfuls of baking powder, one teaspoonful of salt, two table- 
spoonfuls of sugar, one egg, one cup of milk, one cup of cooked 
oatmeal, one tablespoonful of melted butter. Sift the flour and

in gem pans or muffin rings in a hot oven for half an hour. The 
oatmeal should have been cooked rather dry. 

Cold Meat with Puree of Potatoes— Pour good-sized potatoes, 
one tablespoonful of butter, one teacupful of boiling milk, half 
a teaspoonful of salt. Pare and boil the potatoes and mash light 
and fine. Add the butter, salt, boiling milk, a pinch of pepper; 
heat up light and lay on a hot platter. Place on this slices of any 
kind of cold meat, and on each slice put a spoonful of hot gravy, 
and set the platter in the oven for five minutes. Garnish with 
parsley. If there is no gravy left from the day before, put in a 
quart of water with the milk and hard pieces of the meat, and 
boil down to a pint. Put one tablespoonful of butter in a pan, 
and when hot add one tablespoonful of flour, slowly. Stir until 
deep brown and strain the broth in this. Season with a salt- 
spoonful of salt and a spoonful of any kind of sauce, if you 
please. 

Cream of Celery Soup — One head of celery, one pint of water, 
one pint of milk, one tablespoonful of butter, one table- 
spoonful of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt, half a saltspoonful 
of white pepper. Wash and scrape the celery, cut it into half- 
inch pieces, put it into the pint of boiling water, and cook until 
it is very soft. When done, mash it in the water in which it is 
boiled and add the salt and pepper. Let the milk come to a 
boil with a slice of a small onion in it; cream together the butter 
and flour, and stir slowly the boiled milk into it, then add this 
to the celery and strain through a sieve, pressing and mashing 
with the back of a spoon until all but the tough fibers of the 
celery are squeezed through. Return the soup to the fire and 
heat until it is steaming, when it is ready to serve. 

Broiled Steak and Mushrooms— Select a steak from the top 
of the round and have it cut an inch and a half thick. Place 
the steak in a wire broiler, put it as near the glowing coals as 
possible, count ten and turn it, and so on for five or six tim.es; 
then lift the broiler farther away from the coals and let the meat 
cook more slowly. When done, salt and butter, and place on a hot 
dish. Surround with half a dozen good-sized mushrooms, which 
have been cooked as follows: Wipe off the mushrooms and peel 
them, cut off the stems close, butter the mushrooms top and

bottom and let them stand for half an hour; then broil until 
tender in a hot pan or wire broiler. 

Sweet potatoes should be baked in a hot oven, so they cook 
quickly. 

Spinach — After washing the spinach well and picking it 
over, boil in plenty of hot water, salted, for twenty-five minutes. 
Drain and press out the water; chop fine, put back over the fire 
with a large spoonful of butter, a teaspoonfur of sugar, one table- 
spoonful of vinegar, saltspoonful of salt. Beat until hot and 
smooth; turn into a hot dish and garnish with a, hard-boiled egg, 
cut in slices. Another nice dressing is made with a large spoon- 
ful of butter, two of milk, one teaspoonful of sugar and a very 
little nutmeg. 

Sponge Pudding — The yolks of three eggs, four tablespoon- 
fuls of flour, one and a half pints of milk, a pinch of salt, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar. Stir the milk, scalding hot, into the 
flour (which should have been sifted), beat well, then slowly add 
the yolks of the eggs (beating rapidly all the time) and sugar. 
Have the whites beaten to a froth, add them to the batter, and 
pour into a buttered dish and bake at once for half an hour. 
Serve immediately. Any seasoning preferred may be used, a 
teaspoonful of vanilla or rose, a half-teaspoonful of almond, or 
a grate of nutmeg. Mrs. Thomas Turtle.

butter size of an egg, and a pinch of sage, if liked. Pour boil- 
ing water over this, using enough to moisten the bread; then 
stir with fork until quite smooth. Beat three eggs until very

teaspoons baking powder, one-half teaspoonful of salt, two table- 
spoons shortening, milk or water to make a dough not too stiff. 
Take two-thirds of the dough and roll out to fit a good-sized bak- 
ing dish. Sprinkle this with a little flour and add one quart of 
oysters. To the juice of the oysters add one teaspoon of corn- 
starch. Pour over oysters, cover with small lumps of butter, 
season highly with salt and pepper. Roll out the remaining 
dough and cover pie with it, making incisions in top to let out 
air. Bake in moderate oven until crust is a rich brown.

two cloves, two allspice berries, two peppercorns, one teaspoon 
mixed herbs, two sprigs parsley. Put all on to boil in granite 
saucepan. Fry one tablespoon chopped onion in one tablespoon 
butter^ until yellow; then add one heaping tablespoon cornstarch 
and stir all into the tomato. Simmer for ten minutes; add one- 
half teaspoon salt and one-half saltspoon pepper, a dash of 
cayenne and strain, and it is ready for use. This is splendid for 
chops or fish, and should be poured over them while hot. 

Cornstarch Fritters — Boil one pint of milk with one-inch of 
stick cinnamon. Stir together one-half cup sugar, two table- 
spoons cornstarch and one of flour, and add one-fourth cup cold 
milk, and yolk of three eggs well-beaten. Add the boiling milk

double boiler and cook fifteen minutes; stirring often. Take 
from the fire and add one teaspoon butter and one of vanilla. 
Pour into a buttered bread-pan about one inch deep and set to 
cool. When very hard, sprinkle a bread-board with fine bread 
crumbs. Turn the cream out on this and cut into strips two and 
a half inches long and one inch wide, or in diamonds. Cover 
these in crumbs; dip in beaten egg, then in crumbs again, and 
fry one minute in smoking hot lard. Sprinkle with sugar and 
serve hot. It is better to make the cream the night before. They 
are splendid and very delicate. Mrs. Frederick Stingle.

flour, one cup of raisins, seeded, quartered and rolled in flour. 

Mix each part in the order given, putting soda in the milk 
and cream of tartar in the flour, and adding milk and flour alter- 
nately. Put the pink part in the center of a round pan, and the 
white part around the edge. Or bake in two brick loaf pans, the 
pink at the bottom and the white on top. The oven should be of 
a moderate heat. Mrs. Lincoln's recipe. 

Turkish Stew — Cut the remains of cold roast beef into small 
pieces, say one-half inch square. Put two tablespoonfuls of butter 
into a saucepan, throw the meat into the butter, stir carefully 
until the meat is nicely browned, then take it from the fire, add 
four tablespoonfuls of tomato catsup, one onion sliced, and one- 
half cup of stock, one-half teaspoonful of pepper and a green 
pepper chopped fine. Cover and stand on the back part of the 
stove for twenty minutes. Serve in a border of boiled rice. 

Figs in Cream — The figs must be prepared the day before. 
Purchase two pounds of the best Smyrna figs, pull apart and 
cover them with cold water and stand aside over night. Next 
morning put over a slow fire and simmer until the figs are plump 
and tender; add one cup of sugar, juice of one lemon and simmer 
again a few minutes. Turn out to cool; serve in a glass dish with 
whipped cream heaped over. Mrs. Lulu Mansfield.

it a tablespoonful of flour dissolved in a little cold milk. When 
thick like cream put in the minced eggs. Stir it gently around 
and around for a few moments. Serve, garnished with sippets of 
toast. Any desired flavor may be added to the mince, such as 
mushrooms, shrimps or shredded anchovy. 

Panned Oysters — Fit patty pans with pieces of stale bread, 
taking off all the crust; toast and butter them; moisten with 
three or four teaspoonfuls of oyster liquor; place on toast a layer 
of oysters, sprinkled with pepper; put a small piece of butter on 
top of each pan; place all the pans in a baking pan and place in 
the oven, covering tightly. Cook till the beards are ruffled, re- 
move the cover, sprinkle with salt, replace and cook one min- 
ute longer. Serve in patty pans. 

Quince Snow — Quarter five fair-looking quinces and boil them 
in water until they are tender; then peel them and push them 
through a coarse sieve. Sweeten to the taste and add the whites of 
four eggs. Beat all to a stiff froth. Pile with a spoon upon a 
glass dish and set away in the ice box unless wanted immediately. 

Haricot of Oxtails — Three oxtails, two carrots, two onions, two 
small white turnips, three potatoes, three tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter, two of flour, three pints of water, one teaspoonful and a half

Cut the onions very fine, and the carrots, turnips and potatoes into 
large cubes. Put the butter, meat and onions in the stew-pan and 
fry, stirring all the time, until the onions are a golden brown; 
then add the flour and stir two minutes longer. Add the water, 
and, when it comes to a boil skim carefully. Set back where it 
will simmer. When it has been cooking one hour add the carrots 
and turnips. Cook another hour and then add the salt, pepper 
and potatoes. Simmer twenty minutes longer. Heap the vege- 
tables in the center of a hot dish and arrange the tails around 
them. Pour the gravy over all and serve. 

Cabbage a la Prancaise — Chop a small head of cold boiled 
v/hite cabbage and let it drain till perfectly dry. Stir in two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter, scant teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth 
of a teaspoonful of pepper, four tablespoonfuls of milk or cream. 
Heat it through, then add two well-beaten eggs. Turn the mix- 
ture into a buttered frying-pan, stirring until it is very hot and 
a delicate brown on the under side. Place a hot dish over the 
pan, which must be reversed when turned out to be served. 

Apple Tarts — Boil in two tablespoonfuls of water five large 
tart apples; beat until very smooth. When the apples are quite 
soft, then add the yolks of three eggs, the juice and grated rind

Cheese Fritters — Slice thin half a dozen large tart apples, 
and prepare half as many thin slices of nice cheese. Beat up 
two eggs and season with one saltspoonful each of salt and 
mustard and a very small pinch of pepper. Lay the 
slices of cheese to soak for a few minutes in the mixture, then 
put each slice between two slices of apples, sandwich style, and 
dip the whole into the eggs, then fry in hot butter like oysters, 
and serve very hot. These fritters are an addition to any lunch 
table. 

Collared Head — Take four pigs' tongues with a little fat to 
each, salt them for about a week, then boil until quite tender, 
when the skins may be easily taken off; after one has been 
skinned, put it into the pot again to keep it hot, when all are 
skinned cut them up and mix with a teaspoonful each of salt, 
pepper and sage. Put the mixture into a dish, pour in some of 
the liquor to fill up the little spaces, and then press with a heavy 
weight until cold. 

Red Pepper Jelly — Mash ripe red peppers, place the pods in 
an earthen jar which must be set in a kettle of cold water and 
boiled until the juice is entirely extracted. To every pint of 
juice allow r. pound of sugar, and boil until it ropes well. Put 
in small tumblers. This jelly is very nice for cold meats. 

Puree Maigre — One turnip, one carrot, half an onion, one table- 
spoonful of chopped cabbage, half a can of tomatoes, half a cup 
of rav/ rice, stalk of celery, chopped, three tablespoonfuls of but-

ful of sugar, one cup of milk. Pare and grate turnip and carrot.

minutes, throwing the water away. Soak the rice for two hours. 
Put all the vegetables except the tomatoes, with the rice and cold 
water, into the soup kettle; cover and stew gently for an hour 
after the boil is reached. Add the tomatoes, simmer for half an 
hour, and rub through a colander. Return to the fire, stir to a 
boil, add the floured butter, boil up a little faster and stir in the 
milk, scalding hot, first adding a tiny bit of soda. Season and 
pour out. It should not boil after the milk is added. Be care- 
ful not to let the puree "catch" in cooking. 

Veal Cutlets with Lemon Sauce — Dip each cutlet in a beaten 
egg, then in peppered and salted cracker dust, and 
fry in hot dripping to a rich golden brown. Lay each 
as it is done on paper to absorb the grease. Arrange on a hot 
dish and put on every cutlet a generous spoonful oi sauce. Make 
it by beating two tablespoonfuls of butter to a cream with a 
tablespoonful of lemon juice and a tablespoonful of minced pars- 
ley. 

Paradise Pudding — Three pared apples chopped fine, half cup 
of currants, half cup of sugar, two of bread crumbs, three eggs,

over from yesterday's dinner, strain them to remove the seeds. 
Thicken with a tablespoon of flour, worked smoothly in, add one- 
half teaspoon salt, dash of cayenne pepper, butter size of walnut. 
When this has simmered a moment pour over the platter on 
which the chops have been attractively arranged. 

Graham Crackers — Get the unsweetened graham crackers; 
toast carefully or they will become too brown. Butter when hot 
and crisp. 

Salad of Cottage Cheese — Pare two fresh, crisp cucumbers; 
cut in four pieces the long way, avoiding part of the seeds; then 
cut in blocks half an inch thick. Mold the cottage cheese into 
round balls size of walnut; put on lettuce leaves on platter. Be- 
tween the cheese balls sprinkle about the cucumber blocks. Serve 
over this a French dressing — two tablespoons salad oil to one of 
vinegar, half teaspoon salt. A few English walnuts, slightly 
minced, are also an addition to this dainty relish. 

Apple Fritters — Make a batter of one pint of milk, two eggs, 
quarter teaspoon of salt, teaspoon baking powder, one pint flour. 
Beat eggs separately, add yolks to the soft batter; add the whites 
last thing. Cut tart, juicy apples into thin slices until you have 
a pint. Stir into the batter, lightly, drop by the large tablespoon- 
ful into boiling hot lard; cook a light brown, dust with pow- 
dered sugar and serve hot or cold. 

Clear Broth, with Vermicelli — Use two pounds of veal, slice 
of lean ham, tablespoonful of fine lump tapioca, one minced 
onion, heaping teaspoonful salt, half teaspoonful pepper. Allow 
this to simmer for two and a half hours. Strain, return to pot, 
break up a cupful of vermicelli, add, and boil twenty minutes. 
Throw a spoonful of minced parsley into tureen just before 
serving. 

Corned Leg of Mutton — Choose a large leg of fine mutton, 
and have it nicely corned by your butcher. This will require 
about ten days or two weeks. Treat as if it were corned beef, 
boil potatoes in the pot with the mutton. There will be enough 
cold meat to slice for two days' luncheon. 

Cucumber Catchup — This makes a delicious relish for the 
corned mutton. Grate twelve cucumbers (not too ripe) and allow 
to drain in a colander. Mince three large onions very fine; mix 
with a teaspoonful of horseradish and same of white mustard 
seed. Pour over enough real cider vinegar to make quite juicy. 
Do not cook. This will keep perfectly for some time in a cool 
place. 

Baked Cauliflower, with Cheese — Boil the cauliflower un- 
broken until quite tender. Drain, put in a baking dish, smooth 
a tablespoonful of flour into a cup of milk; pour about the cauli- 
flower slightly separated. Scatter breadcrumbs on top with salt 
and pepper; grate over mild, fresh cheese quite thickly, put in 
oven long enough to thoroughly melt the cheese and boil the milk. 
If oven is hot — about twenty minutes. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 497 

Stewed Apricots — Get the dried California apricots; boil un- 
til tender in enough water to quite cover them. Remove the 
fruit. To a quart of juice use a full cup of sugar; boil briskly ten 
or twelve minutes; pour over fruit. Serve cold. 

Sunshine Cake — Three eggs beaten separately, one cup of 
sugar, one-third cup butter, two-thirds cup of milk, two teaspoons 
baking powder. Beat thoroughly together, adding white of eggs 
last thing. Can be baked in a loaf or will make two full layer 
cakes. Cora Mclntire.

they have been cooked one-half cup canned tomatoes, a sprinkle 
of cayenne pepper and a tablespoon of fiour which has been 
smoothly creamed in a little cold milk. Pour over the balls and 
serve very hot. The meat balls may be prepared the previous day.

cup butter, one egg, two tablespoons sugar, one-half cup sour 
milk in which one even teaspoon baking soda has been dissolved, 
a little cinnamon and a pinch of ground cloves. Enough flour

of dates and fill with some finely chopped almonds or English 
walnuts; press together and roll in powdered sugar; lay aside. 
Next make a baked custard as follows: Yolks of three eggs well 
beaten with two tablespoonfuls granulated sugar, one pint sweet

beaten egg and bread crumbs. Put them in the frying basket and 
plunge into boiling fat. Cook ten minutes. Serve with a garnish 
of toasted bread and parsley. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 499 

Baked Mushrooms — Toast for each person a large slice of 
bread, and spread over with rich, sweet cream; lay on each slice, 
head downward, a mushroom, or, if small, more than one; sea- 
son each with a pinch of salt and a dash of pepper, and fill each 
with as much cream as it will hold. Place over each a custard 
cup, pressing well down to the toast; set in a moderate oven and 
cook fifteen minutes. Do not remove the cups for five minutes 
after they come from the oven, as thereby the flavor of the mush- 
room is preserved in its entirety. 

Br.aised Beef — Take a slice from the top of the round, weigh- 
ing about three pounds, and cut one and one-half inches thick. 
Season it with a teaspoonful of salt and a quarter teaspoonful of 
pepper; cut gashes in the top or upper side and fill with stufiing. 
Roll the meat up and skewer it; dredge with flour and brown it 
in a frying-pan in some salt pork fat. Put it into the braising- 
pan, with one-third of a cup of carrots cut into dice, three slices 
of onion and a small bit of bay leaf. Pour on three cupfuls of 
boiling water and simmer three hours. 

Stuffing — One-third of a cup of rolled cracker crumbs, to 
which has been added a scant tablespoonful butter, a saltspoon- 
ful salt, a speck of pepper and one-half teaspoonful of thyme, 
summer savory or sweet marjoram, or such mixed seasoning as 
is liked. Moisten the whole with four tablespoonfuls of hot milk 
or water. 

Sauce — Brown two tablespoonfuls of butter, adding two 
pounding tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir until the whole becomes 
brown. Pour on to this slowly the liquor in the meat pan, which 
should be about one pint. 

Sweet Potato Salad — Boil three large sweet potatoes. Cut 
into half-inch squares. Cut into very small pieces two stalks of 
celery. Season with salt and pepper and pour over a French 
dressing as follows: Three tablespoonfuls salad oil, two of vine- 
gar, one teaspoonful onion juice, one saltspoon each salt and pep- 
per. Let salad stand in refrigerator two hours. Garnish with 
pickles, pitted olives and parsley. 

Harvard Pudding — Sift together two and one-third cups of 
flour, one-half cup of flne granulated sugar, two teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder and one-quarter of a teaspoonful of salt. Work 
into this with the tips of the flngers one-third of a cupful of but- 
ter. Beat one egg light, add a cupful of milk and turn onto the 
dry ingredients. Pour the mixture into a buttered mold and 
steam two hours. Do not allow the water to stop boiling for an 
instant. 

Sauce — Serve this pudding with a simple apple sauce and a 
hard sauce. For the latter cream one-third of a cup of butter, add- 
ing slowly one cup of powdered sugar, one teaspoonful of lemon 
juice and three-quarters of a teaspoonful of vanilla. This com- 
bination is a pleasant change from either flavor alone.

also in the fat. Lay sliced pork in the bottom of a saucepan; 
upon this the mutton, then the sweetbreads, next the onion, green

ring constantly until it begins to thicken; then add a saltspoon- 
ful of salt and pour over the tomatoes. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 501 

Cocoanut Pie — For a pie put a cup of grated cocoanut to soak

quarter cut a second time; one pint of boiling water, two-thirds

Ham Salad — One cup of cold ham chopped (from which all 
fat has been cut away), one cup of sliced cucumber pickles, three 
hard-boiled eggs. Arrange ham and cucumbers in layers, sav-

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 503 

Breaded Sausage — Wipe dry one pound of "little pig" sausage. 
Brown a cup of bread crumbs in the oven and beat one egg with 
a teaspoonful of cold water. Dip the sausages in the egg and then 
in the bread crumbs; place them in a frying-basket and plunge it 
into boiling fat; cook for ten minutes and serve with a garnish 
of toasted bread points. 

Toasted Muffins — The muffins are supposed to be at least twen- 
ty-four hours old; and to toast them in the English fashion they 
must be broken all around the edge as if one intended to split 
them, then toasted on both sides until the crust will crack under 
the thumb nail. Tear them open quickly, put a bountiful supply 
of small pieces of butter on the inside of each half, close it and 
place in the oven while the remainder are being toasted. 

Blanquette of Veal — Melt three level tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter; add two level tablespoonfuls of flour, and stir in gradually 
one cup of milk; add one and a half cups of cold veal cut in dice, 
the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs chopped fine, and the whites cut 
in small pieces. Cook for three minutes. Season with one-fourth 
of a teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth of a saltspoonful of white pep- 
per and a few grains of cayenne, and serve at once. 

Waldorf Salad (Miss Colling's recipe) — A half-pint of sour, 
crisp apples, sliced and then cut in small squares, and an equal 
quantity of crisp celery cut in half-inch pieces. Sprinkle with a 
half-teaspoonful of salt and pour over it a half-pint of mayonnaise 
dressing, mixing thoroughly with a silver fork. Make a mound 
of"the salad in the center of a pretty china tray, garnish with the 
celery tops and serve. 

Milk Soup — Mash through the colander two good-sized boiled 
potatoes. Cut one medium-sized onion in slices, place the slices 
on top of each other and cut in strips. Add the potato and onion 
— together with a half-dozen whole allspice and two tablespoonfuls 
of tapioca — to three pints of cold water and cook until the onion 
is tender. Then add one pint of boiling milk, one rounded table- 
spoonful of butter, a level teaspoonful of salt and half a saltspoon- 
ful of white pepper. Let it boil up once and serve with salted 
wafers. 

The ordinary soup plate, properly filled for serving, holds a 
half-pint, so that three pints of soup would be sufficient quan- 
tity for five; but three pints of water are used in order to allow 
for the "boiling away" that always occurs. 

Baked Beef Heart — See that the butcher removes the gristle 
and the "deaf ears," as the tough, red lobe at the top is called. 
Then lay the heart in boiling water for half an hour, keeping it 
just simmering. When thus parboiled, dry it well and fill the three 
holes with a stuffing made with two tablespoonfuls of beef suet, 
chopped fine, one cup of bread crumbs, one tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley, the juice of half a lemon, half a teaspoonful of 
salt and one-fourth of a saltspoonful of pepper. Fill the heart full 
of the stuffing, but do not press it in tight. Skewer over the top 
three thin slices of fat salt pork, dredge it with flour, and bake it 
one hour and a half in a good oven. If you have it, make a half- 



504 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

glassful of red currant jelly very hot and serve with the heart as 
sauce. The platter and plates must be very hot, and the heart 
covered as it goes to table. The next day, should any of the heart 
remain, it can be warmed over by cutting it into slices and gently 
stewing it in a rich gravy. It is thought by some to be nicer than 
venison prepared in this way. 

Cheese Fritters — Rub together three ounces of flour and one 
ounce of butter. Add a half-teaspoonful of salt and a dash of 
cayenne; then stir in by degrees a half-cup of tepid water; then 
three ounces of grated cheese is added with the yolk of an egg, 
and, lastly, the white of the egg beaten very stiff. Drop the mix- 
ture by spoonfuls into a kettle of boiling cotosuet and cook three 
minutes. The result should be delicious, golden-brown balls as big 
as one's fist, permeated with the flavor of cheese.

ing dish drop four eggs, sprinkle with a saltspoonful of salt, and 
set in the oven to bake. When the whites are set remove from 
the oven, pour the sauce over the top and serve. 

Whole Wheat Puffs— Put the yolk of an egg into a basin, and 
beat the white in a separate dish to a stiff froth. Add to the yolk 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 505 

one-half a cup of rather thin cream and one cupful of skim milk, 
and a half-saltspoonful of salt. Beat the egg, cream and milk 
together until perfectly mingled and foaming with air-bubbles; 
then add gradually, beating well at the same time, one pint of 
wheat flour; continue the beating vigorously and without interrup- 
tion for eight or ten minutes. Then stir in lightly the white of the 
egg, and turn at once into heated, shallow irons, and bake for half 
an hour in moderately quick oven. 

Sweet Gingerbread — One cupful of granulated sugar, one-third 
of a cupful of butter, two and one-half cupfuls of flour, one cupful 
of New Orleans molasses, one teaspoonful of ginger, one-half tea- 
spoonful of cloves, one teaspoonful of cinnamon. Stir thoroughly 
and add one cupful of boiling water in which has been dissolved 
one level teaspoonful of soda. Then add two eggs, well beaten, 
and one-half cupful each of seeded raisins and orange peel chopped 
fine. Bake in a moderate oven. 

Shoulder of Lamb, a la Parisienne — Have the butcher bone the 
meat neatly. Prepare a stuffing of four ounces of bread crumbs, 
two ounces of raw veal, chopped fine, two tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter melted, one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one teaspoonful 
of salt and one-quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper. Mix all to- 
gether and stuff the meat with it. Roast in a quick oven. Into 
two tablespoonfuls of softened (not melted) butter mix one table- 
spoonful each of chopped parsley shallots, lemon juice and beef 
extract. Draw the meat when done from the oven, spread it with 
the prepared sauce and return it to the oven just long enough to 
melt it. Garnish with small, round, fried potatoes. 

Orange Pudding — To one quart of milk add one-half of a cup- 
ful of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, mixed with a little 
cold water, the yolks of three eggs. Grate the rind and press out 
the juice of three oranges. Scald the milk, add the cornstarch, 
then the sugar and eggs. Boil for three minutes. Beat the whites 
to a stiff froth, add four tablespoonfuls of sugar; spread over the 
pudding and brown slightly in the oven.

the sirup over them. Eat cold. Enough for two meals. 

Corn Batter Cakes — One and one-half cups white cornmeal, 
sifted with a teaspoonful of sugar and a half teaspoonful of salt. 
Add one cup of boiled rice and a teaspoonful of lard. Mix all to-

Thin with one and one-half cups sour milk, one-half teaspoon- 
ful soda dissolved in milk; last stir one beaten egg and bake on 
hot greased griddle. 

Potted Ham^The scraps from a boiled ham may be utilized 
for a small jar of potted meat. Chop all the scraps very fine, re- 
moving all the gristle and hard, dry pieces. Pound it to a paste 
in a mortar, or a wooden chopping bowl, and a potato masher may 
be used. Measure the paste, and to every half-pint add a half- 
teaspoonful of mustard and half a saltspoon of cayenne. If dry, 
add a teaspoonful of melted butter. Pack tightly into small earth- 
en cups. Paste papers over them, lay covers over the papers and 
set the cups in a pan of boiling water. Bake slowly one hour. 
Remove the covers, and, if it is to be kept a length of time, pour 
melted fat over the top of meat. Eat cold, sliced very thin. 

Chicken, with Mushrooms — Have ready one pound of cold 
cooked chicken, cut in dice, and one-half pint of mushrooms, cut 
in small pieces. Cover mushrooms with hot water and cook five 
minutes. Skim out into a hot dish. Add enough milk to the 
liquid to make a coffeecupful. Thicken with a tablespoonful of 
flour rubbed smooth in the same quantity of butter. Season with 
a saltspoonful of salt and half as much white pepper. Add the 
chicken and mushrooms and cook two minutes longer, stirring 
constantly. Serve on hot platter. 

Dates in Cream — Remove the stones from one-half pound of 
dates. Cut the dates fine and put them in a glass dish. Cover 
with two cupfuls of whipped cream and let stand in a cold place 
one-half hour before serving. Mrs. Carrie Lawton.

ful of milk, in which has been dissolved one-half cake of com- 
pressed yeast and a tablespoonful of sugar. Stir in a quart of 
sifted flour; cover, and leave in a warm place to rise. This 
should be mixed in the morning. One hour before luncheon turn 
out on a biscuit board and with just enough flour to handle roll 
out and cut with a biscuit cutter; place them one on lop of an- 
other (like a sandwich) in a baking-pan; let them rise and bake 
in a quick oven. 

Baked Apples with Hot Sauce — In baking apples for hot 
sauce, simply remove the cores; stand the apples in a baking 
dish; put a teaspoonful of sugar into the spaces from which the 
cores were taken; add a half cup of water and bake until soft. 
Beat one tablespoonful of butter and four of powdered sugar to- 
gether until light. Dish the apples and turn the hot sauce from 
baking dish into the butter and sugar; then add a cup of boil- 
ing water. Stir carefully over the fire for just an instant; add 
a teaspoonful of vanilla, and pour over the apples. 

Mushroom Soup — Pick and peel three-quarters of a pint of 
mushrooms; wash them thoroughly, and cut them up into dice. 
Stew them in half a pint of seasoned veal or chicken broth. Add 
to this one quart of good seasoned soup stock; thicken with one 
tablespoonful of flour, rubbed into one tablespoonful of butter; 
season with one saltspoonful of salt and one-half as much pepper. 

Panned Rabbit — Cut a large, fat rabbit in halves; place in 
a baking pan; spread with bits of butter; dust with a half tea- 
spoonful of salt and one saltspoonful of pepper, and set in a 
quick oven to bake for one hour. When done, take up; add a 
tablespoonful of flour to the fat in the pan; mix well; pour in 
half a pint of hot water; let come to a boil; season with one- 
half teaspoonful salt and one-fourth saltspoonful pepper and pour 
around the rabbit. Serve with currant jelly. 

Turnip Salad — Peel and slice very thin four tender young tur- 
nips; cut up two small, white onions. Line a salad-bowl with 
lettuce leaves; put in the turnips and onions; pour on them a 
pint of plain salad dressing. Mix lightly and serve very cold. 

Lerpon Pudding — Put a quarter of a pound of macaroons in 
a pint of milk to soak until soft. Beat four eggs with half a 
cupful of powdered sugar until light, and stir into the milk. Beat 
the whole until thick and smooth; add the juice and grated rind 
of two lemons. Pour into a well-buttered pudding mold; cover, 
and stand in a pot of boiling water to boil for one hour. Serve 
with lemon sauce. 

Lemon Sauce — Put a tablespoonful of cornstarch into a bowl,

water; steam till the whites are cooked. Take out on a hot plat- 
ter, sprinkle over with one small half-teaspoonful of salt and 
one-eighth teaspoonful of pepper, and pour over all a tablespoon- 
ful of melted butter. 

Oyster Macaroni — Break enough macaroni into inch pieces 
to fill a pint cup. Put in a saucepan and cover with boiling 
water. Keep at the boiling point till tender (twenty or thirty 
minutes). Have ready one pint of oysters, a teaspoonful of salt, 
a saltspoonful of pepper and half a cupful of cream. Drain the 
macaroni, and put a layer in buttered baking dish, sprinkle over 
a little of the salt and pepper, little dots of butter and a little 
cream; then a layer of the oysters, and another of the macaroni, 
with more of the seasoning. Sprinkle cracker crumbs over the

510 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

celery or olives. Place two together and keep in a cool place till

Blackberry-Jam Cake — Rub to a cream one-half of a cupful of 
butter, gradually add one cupful of sugar, the yolks of three eggs 
and the whites of two (reserve the other white for frosting), one- 
half a cupful of sour milk or thin cream, one-half teaspoon- 
ful of soda, one level teaspoonful each of cinnamon and 
allspice, two scant cupfuls of sifted flour and one cupful of 
thick blackberry jam or preserves. 

Roast Duck with Baked Apples — Take a young duck that 
weighs about four pounds; singe and wash quickly; wipe dry, 
and rub both the inside and outside of the fowl with the juice of 
half a lemon (reserve the other half for the pudding sauce); 
then fill with a dressing made of three cupfuls of light but stale 
bread crumbs, one large cookingspoonful of softened butter, one 
small onion minced fine, one large sour apple cut in rather thick 
slices, one teaspoonful of salt and one-fourth teaspoonful of pep- 
per; mix all, place in the fowl, sew up and bake in a hot oven till 
tender, basting often. (Two or three very thin slices of bacon 
laid on any fowl when put in the roasting pan improves the flavor 
and color.) Serve with tart baked apples. 

French Puff Pudding — One-third cupful of butter, one small 
teacupful of sugar, two eggs beaten separately, one teacupful of 
sweet milk, two teacupfuls of flour, one-half teaspoonful of soda 
and one slightly heaping teaspoonful of cream tartar. Put the 
batter in muffin rings or gem pans and bake in a quick oven; 
take out on a hot platter, and when ready to serve pour over a 
sauce made of one tablespoonful of flour rubbed smooth with 
three tablespoonfuls of softened butter. Put in a saucepan, add 
one cupful of sugar, one and one-half cupfuls of boiling water 
and the juice and grated rind of half a lemon.

DINNER. 

Puree of bean soup. 

Broiled veal steak. Baked potatoes. 

Rice tafile. 

Coffee. 



Fried Mushrooms — Take large, firm mushrooms; remove the 
stems and peel. Roll in meal and fry in boiling fat. Sprinkle with 
salt, and squeeze a little lemon juice over them. Serve imme- 
diately. 

East Indian Sauce — Chop fine a half -handful of green mint; 
put into a bowl; add a little lemon juice, and rub into a paste, 
Take one large, green pepper; chop it fine; put it into another 
bowl; add a little lemon juice and rub to a paste. Empty the 
bowl of mint into the bowl of green pepper; mix thoroughly, add- 
ing a saltspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of fine white sugar 
and more lemon juice, until a thick green liquid is produced. Stir 
this constantly; pour into a shallow dish and serve. This sauce 
must be used as soon as made, otherwise its fragrancy and 
piquancy will be lost. This is an excellent sauce for cold meats, 
fowl or game. 

California Fig Cake — One-half teacupful of butter, one tea- 
cupful-of sugar, one and a half teacupfuls of flour, three eggs, a 
teaspoonful of baking powder and a half pound of figs. Open the 
figs; spread them upon a dish and put in the oven a few moments 
to soften. Mix the batter and pour half of it into a square pan. 
Spread the figs over the surface; then add the remainder of the 
batter. Bake in a moderate oven. Spread a thick layer of boiled 
icing over the cake. 

Broiled Veal Steaks — These are delicious broiled as beef- 
steak over a hot fire. The steak should be cut about a quarter 
of an inch thick to cook quickly through, and when taken up on 
a heated platter should be spread with a little butter and sprink- 
led with a little salt and pepper. Or, place three pounds of veal 
steak, cut in the ordinary manner, in a pan with a lump of butter, 
a teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper sprinkled light- 
ly over it, also a little flour, and bake in a hot oven about half an 
hour. This is truly delicious. 

Rice Tafile — One cup of rice; cooked tender in one quart rich 
milk; take from stove and add yolks of two eggs, one cup of 
sugar and a pinch of salt; pare and round out the cores of six 
good cooking apples; place in a deep pudding dish; put one tea- 
spoonful of jelly in each cavity, with the same quantity of thick, 
sweet cream. Pour the rice between and around the apples and 
bake until apples are tender. Beat whites of the eggs with one- 
half cup of sugar; add a little lemon juice; spread over the top, 
and return to the oven to brown. To be eaten with cream, if de- 
sired. Miss A. Caskey.

pepper and serve with gravy. 

Stewed Squirrels — Three fine gray squirrels, skinned and 
cleaned; joint as you would chickens for fricassee; half-pound of 
fat salt pork, one onion (if liked) sliced, half-can of corn, half- 
can of tomatoes, three tablespoonfuls of butter rolled in flour,

ty minutes later stir in butter and flour. Simmer ten minutes, 
and serve in a deep dish. 

Quince Souffle — Stew three or four quinces soft, sweeten and 
pass through a colander. Pour into a glass dish and cover with 
a custard made of one pint of milk, three egg yolks and two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar. Whip whites of eggs light with three

Dates with Wheatlet — Wash, stone and chop one cupful of 
dates. Prepare the wheatlet and just before serving add the 
dates. Serve hot, with milk. 

Baked Eggs — Butter a shallow pudding dish or large plate 
lightly, and drop into it five or six eggs; season with one-quarter 
teaspoonful of salt. Pour over them a small cup of good, well- 
seasoned gravy and bake till the whites are firm — about seven min- 
utes. 

Fish Sandwiches — Fish sandwiches may be made from bits of 
cold fish left over; it only takes a little for a pretty, open sand- 
wich. Put the fish into a bowl, and with the back of a spoon mash 
or rub it well, add two tablespoonfuls of cream, a sprinkle of salt 
and pepper; have the bread cut into rounds and spread thickly 
with the fish; have ready the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs 
pressed through a sieve; garnish the tops of the sandwiches with 
the egg and serve. These sandwiches are open — that is, the fish is 
not between two slices of bread. 

Tomato Figs — Scald and skin small-sized, ripe tomatoes, either 
the red or yellow variety. To eight pounds of tomatoes add three 
pounds of brown sugar; cook slowly and carefully in the sugar 
without water till it has thoroughly penetrated them; then take 
them out, spread on plates and dry them. Pack them in layers in 
jars or boxes, with sugar sprinkled between. 

Puree of Chestnuts — Shell one pint of chestnuts, blanch them, 
put them into a quart of water, add one root of celery cut into 
small pieces, a slice of onion and a bay leaf; cook gently until 
the chestnuts are tender; press through a sieve and add one pint 
of milk; return this to the fire, add a tablespoonful of arrowroot 
which has been moistened in a little cold water; stir until it 
reaches the boiling point, add a teaspoonful of salt, a dash of pep- 
per and a tablespoonful of butter; serve immediately. 

English Chops — Purchase thick mutton chops; season care- 
fully and dip into bread crumbs; fry in smoking hot fat, and 
serve very hot. 

Baked Squash — Cut open the squash, take out the seeds and 
without paring cut it up into large pieces; put the pieces on tins 
or a dripping pan, place in a moderately hot oven and bake about 
an hour. When done serve the pieces hot on a dish, season with 



514 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK: BOOKT. 

butter, pepper and salt. Squash retains its sweetness better this 
way than when boiled. Small Hubbard squash is the best for 
baking. 

Quince Puff — Pare six good-sized tart apples, cut them into 
thin slices and put them into a sauce-pan with a quince also cut 
into thin slices; add a half-cup of water, cover the sauce-pan and 
cook slowly for a half -hour. Press through a sieve, return to the 
fire and add the yolks of three eggs beaten with a half-cup of 
sugar; take from the fire and when somewhat cooled stir in the 
well-beaten whites of the eggs; turn into a pretty dish and stand 
away to cool. Mrs. Charles Adams.

Sweet potatoes, fried. Spoon corn bread. 

Baked pears. Tea or cocoa. 

DINNER. 

Cream of celery soup. 

Stewed beefsteak. Creamed carrots. 

Mashed potatoes. 

Pain perdu. 

Fried Bacon, Cream Gravy — Cut the bacon very thin and 
fry on both sides until the edges curl up. Remove the bacon, keep 
it hot, and to the fat in the spider add one tablespoonful of flour 
and one-half pint of milk. Stir until very smooth and cook five 
minutes. Pour over bacon. 

Coffee — Mix coffee first with one-half egg and then with a lit- 
tle cold water. Let stand about two minutes and pour boiling 
water over it. When it comes to a boil it is ready for use. The 
coffee pot should be hot when the coffee is put in and one table- 
spoonful ground coffee should be allowed to each cup of water. 

Milk Bread — One pint milk scalded and cooled, one table- 
spoonful butter, m.elted in the hot milk, one tablespoonful sugar, 
one teaspoonful salt, one-half cup yeast or one-half yeast cake, 
six or seven cups flour. 

Measure the milk after scalding, and put it in the mixing bowl; 



I'HE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. ^16 

add the butter, sugar and salt. When cool, add the yeast, and 
then stir in the flour, adding it gradually after five cups are in, 
that it may not be too stiff; use just enough to knead it. Knead 
till smooth and elastic. Cover; let it rise till light; cut it down; 
divide into four parts; shape into loaves or biscuit. Let it rise 
again in the pans. Bake forty or fifty minutes. 

For milk bread made with a sponge, use the same quantities, 
but add only three cups of flour for the first mixing and beat well. 
Let it rise about three hours; then add from two to three cups 
of flour, or enough to knead it free from the board; knead one- 
half hour. Let it rise in the bowl, and again after being shaped 
into loaves or rolls, and bake as usual. 

Bread made up over night with a sponge should have only 
half the quantity of yeast used that is required when it is made 
up in the morning. 

Bread may be made with half milk, half water, or all water. 
In the latter case double the amount of butter should be used as 
given for milk bread; and the water should be v/arm enough to 
melt it and the sugar and salt. 

Stewed Kidneys — Cut the kidneys into small dice and throw 
into boiling water and cook one hour; one dozen will be enough 
for five persons. Lambs' kidneys are used. Put on the fire one- 
half pint of milk and when it comes to a boil add one heaping 
teaspoonful of flour and one heaping teaspoonful of butter. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper and stew the kidneys in this sauce for ten 
minutes. 

Boil the sweet potatoes until soft, cut in slices and fry a 
golden brown in butter or drippings. 

Maryland Spoon Corn Bread — Put one quart of milk on the 
fire, in a double boiler; when it comes to a boil stir in four large 
kitchen spoonfuls of cornmeal and cook five minutes — stirring 
all the time. Remove from the fire and stir once or twice as it 
cools. When cool add three eggs well beaten with two tablespoon- 
fuls flour, one tablespoonful butter, one scant teaspoonful salt. 
Pour in a greased dish and bake thirty-five minutes. Serve im- 
mediately with napkin around dish. 

Celery Soup — Take two large celery roots, cut up fine and boil 
slowly one hour in one pint of water. Flavor with a little piece 
of onion; mash and strain through a fine sieve. Beat together one 
tablespoonful of butter and two of flour; add one quart of milk 
and boil all together twenty minutes, add one scant teaspoonful of 
salt, one-fourth teaspoonful of pepper. Serve with one-half pint of 
whipped cream added at the last minute. 

Stewed Beefsteak — Take two pounds of round steak, cut in five 
pieces, season with one teaspoonful salt and one-half teaspoonful 
pepper and spread over them two onions chopped fine and one ta- 
blespoonful of butter cut up and dredged with flour. Put in a stew- 
pan without water and cover close. Set the pan back where it can 
only simmer — not boil — and cook two hours. Serve with their own 
gravy. Mary Meeker.

Mushroomed Cutlets — Cut one and a half pounds of veal cut- 
lets into individual pieces, dust with a teaspoonful of salt and 
one saltspoonful of pepper; dip first in beaten egg and then in 
finely chopped mushrooms. Fry in boiling fat until done. 

Mexican Stew— A large cupful of cold, cooked and minced 
chicken. Take half the quantity of uncooked ham cut in very 
small dice, both fat and lean, and fry for a moment in a table- 
spoonful of butter, add the chicken, a teaspoonful of minced pars- 
ley, a dash of pepper, and when very hot stir in two heaping cup- 
fuls of boiled seasoned rice. Toss all lightly together, and give 
just a dash of lemon juice. 

Columbia Cake— Three eggs, one teacupful sugar, one table- 
spoonful butter, one and one-half teacupfuls flour, half a teacup- 
ful of cold water, one teaspoonful of baking powder and one tea- 
cupful of chopped hickory nut meats. Beat the sugar and butter 
to a cream, add the yolks of the eggs, beat well, add the water, 
then the flour and baking powder; mix well, add the nut meats 
and then the well beaten whites of the eggs. 

Pumpkin Soup— This is a novelty and delicious. For one 
quart of soup peel and chop one-half pint bowl full of pumpkin, 
and a small head of celery. Fry them in a scant tablespoonful of 
butter, lightly browned over the fire, and then add one quart of 
boiling water, a half teaspoonful of salt, and a half saltspoonful

of pepper. Boil all together until the ingredients can be mashed 
through a colander. Return them to the saucepan with the water 
used in boiling them, and place it over the fire. Rub to a smooth 
paste in a saucepan over the fire a scant tablespoonful each of 
iDutter and flour, stir the paste smoothly into the soup and con- 
tinue the boiling. Cut a half cupful of half-inch dice of stale 
bread, fry them brown in smoking hot fat, and drain. After the 
soup has boiled until it is smooth and creamy, serve in a tureen 
with the fried bread. 

Fried Rabbit a la Creole — Skin, clean and joint two rabbits. 
Put a tablespoonful of pork drippings into a frying-pan; when 
hot put in two small onions sliced in rings, and let fry two or 
three minutes; add three slices of fat bacon, the jointed rabbit, 
a tablespoonful of minced parsley and a quarter of a pod of red 
pepper minced. Cut the slices of bacon in two pieces, arrange 
on a platter, placing the cooked rabbits on the bacon, and strew 
the cooked onion over the rabbit. 

New England Apple Pie — Use a deep pie-plate. Pare Bald- 
win or Greening apples, core and cut in thin slices. Line your 
pie-plate with pastry, place a layer of apples over this, and 
sprinkle with brown sugar. Then another layer of apple, with 
the sugar, until the pie-plate is well filled and heaped in the 
middle. Over the top dot bits of butter; shake a pinch of salt 
over the whole, and a wee dash of red pepper. It will give a rich, 
pungent seasoning which other spices will not. Wet the edge 
of the lower crust, sprinkle with flour, put on the upper crust, and 
press the edges firmly together. Bake a rich brown.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 519 

Buttered Toast — As some one expresses it, "There is toast 
and toast, and much of it is neither palatable nor digestible." 
The object in toasting bread is to extract the moisture, so that 
the bread becomes pure farina of wheat. But when bread is ex- 
posed to a hot fire so that the outside becomes charred, the in- 
side retains its moisture, becoming soggy and indigestible; and 
butter applied does not penetrate, but floats on the surface as 
rancid oil. Take bread at least a day old, cut thin and evenly, 
trimming off edges for the crumb-jar. First warm thoroughly 
each side of slice, then present first side nearer fire until it slow- 
ly takes on a rich, even brown color. Treat the other side in the 
same way, butter and dust with powdered sugar, if liked, and 
serve hot. 

Baked Potatoes — As an important element of the blood is 
potash, which is freely soluble in water, potatoes baked are 
much more wholesome than boiled. They should, however, be 
served immediately when done, else they become watery; and 
in trying them never use a fork, as that allows the steam to es- 
cape, making the potato heavy; but instead mash lightly between 
the fingers. 

Hot Scotch Rolls — One cup oat flakes scalded with one-half 
cup boiling milk; add to these, when they are cold, one-third cup 
molasses, one level tablespoon butter, and beat for flve minutes; 
thicken with white flour, as for ordinary bread, leaving dough 
rather soft. Let rise over night, and in the morning mold into 
small rolls, let rise until quite light, glaze with white of egg and 
bake in moderate oven. These are excellent and repay the trou- 
ble in preparing them. 

Apple Omelet — Pare, core and stev/ four large or six small 
tart apples. Rub through sieve, beat very smooth while hot, add- 
ing one tablespoon butter, eight tablespoons sugar and one-half 
teaspoon grated nutmeg (if liked). Whip very light yolks and 
whites, separately, of four eggs, add these to the apples when 
the latter are perfectly cold, yolks first; then stir in one tea- 
spoon rose water or vanilla; lastly, the whites of eggs, stirring 
in latter with a few swift strokes. Pour all into a deep pudding 
dish, previously buttered and heated. Bake in a moderate oven 
to a delicate brown, and you will find this delicious. 

Pigs in Blankets — Slice fine breakfast bacon (smoked pre- 
ferred) very thin; inclose in each slice one or two large oys- 
ters, peppered and salted lightly; roll up carefully in the bacon 
and fasten with a toothpick. Dip each roll in egg, sprinkle light- 
ly with cornmeal and fry a delicate brown in butter or lard. 
The bacon must be thin as a knife-blade and must be fried very 
quickly. When done and still hot, squeeze two or three drops 
of lemon juice on each roll. 

Tomato Soup — One quart of stewed tomatoes or one quart 
can, one pint of stock, and one small onion, one bay leaf, one 
stalk of celery and a sprig of parsley, one teaspoonful of sugar, 
one-quarter teaspoonful of soda, two level teaspoonfuls of but- 
ter^ four level teaspoonfuls of flour^ one teaspoonful of salt and 



520 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

one saltspoonful of pepper. Put the tomatoes in a saucepan with 
the onion, bay leaf, parsley and celery; let it stew for about ten 
minutes. Now press through a sieve fine enough to remove the 
seeds. Put it into a clean saucepan with the stock, place over the 
fire and bring to a boiling point. Rub the butter and flour to- 
gether until smooth, and stir into the boiling soup. Stir con- 
stantly until smooth, then add the salt and pepper, sugar and 
soda, and serve. 

Veal Cutlets a la Maintenon — Procure two pounds of cutlets, 
having them three-fourths of an inch thick. Trim and dip each 
in beaten egg, then into pounded cracker, which has been sea- 
soned with white pepper, salt and a bit of sweet marjoram. Wrap 
each cutlet in a half a sheet of letter paper, well buttered; lay 
them upon a buttered gridiron and broil over a clear, not too hot, 
fire, turning often. Secure the paper by fringing the ends and 
twisting fringes after the cutlet has been put in. Have ready 
duplicate papers in a clean, hot dish, and if the envelopes become 
soiled and darkened in the broiling transfer to the clean, warm 
ones, emptying every drop of gravy over the cutlet. Veal cooked 
in covers is most delicious, as in this way the flavor and juice are 
retained in meat. 

Short Cake — One teacup sugar, two tablespoons butter, two 
eggs, one cup flour, sifted with a level teaspoon baking powder, 
three tablespoons milk. Have all cold as possible, and mix very 
quickly with a broad-bladed knife, having previously melted and 
cooled the butter and beaten the eggs. Bake in two round jelly- 
cake tins. 

Quince Filling — Choose four small or two large perfect yel- 
low quinces, pare and grate on a coarse grater into a bowl. Make 
a thick sirup of one and a half cups of granulated sugar, boiled 
with a little water. When partly cold, stir into it the grated 
quince. Stir hard for a moment, then spread between the layers 
of cake, dusting the upper layer with powdered sugar. Serve 
as soon as possible after grating the quince, cutting as you would 
a pie, and pouring over each piece whipped cream (well sweet- 
ened), or any preferred pudding sauce.

Many dishes as prepared by the Chinese are admirable in 
every respect. They please the eye as well as the palate, are 
easily digested and very nutritious. 

Mushroom Omelet — Take a dozen large, fresh mushrooms, wash 
thoroughly, peel carefully, and cut off the stems so as to leave the 
plates in one flat piece. Mince the stems very fine and add them to 
three eggs, well beaten. Season with one-half teaspoon salt, one- 
half saltspoon white pepper and a dash of red pepper, mix all well, 
pour over the mushroom plates and then transfer each to the fry- 
ing-pan, in which a tablespoonful of butter has been melted. Each 
mushroom should be just encircled with the egg and minced stems. 
Fry to a rich brown. Those v/ho like the mushrooms well done 
should cover the frying pan and not turn the omelets; cooked in 
this way, the eggs and mince preserve their color and make a pret- 
ty contrast with the creamy hue of the mushroom. Each omelet 
should be about one inch and a half to two inches in diameter, two 
morsels. If the mushrooms are too large for this they should 
be cut in half before cooking. 

Meat Dumplings — Either raw or cooked meat, or fish of any 
kind may be used. The meat should have all bone, gristle and 
outside skin removed, and be minced. To a cup of this minced 
meat add a cup of minced celery and one onion also minced; season 
with one-half teaspoon salt, one-half saltspoon white pepper and a 
dash of red pepper, and a few drops of Worcester sauce. Make a 
dough of baking powder as if for biscuit, roll about a quarter of 
an inch thick, a piece of dough large enough to hold a tablespoon- 
ful of the mixture, around which it should be wrapped. Steam 
about an hour. 

Mixed Pickles — Take one peck of green tomatoes, ten onions, 
ten green peppers; chop all together; add one cup of salt; let stand 
all night; drain dry; put in a porcelain lined kettle with one pound 
of brown sugar, one-half teacup grated horseradish, one table- 
spoonful each ground black pepper, mustard, whole white mus- 
tard seed, and celery seed. Cover with vinegar and boil gently one 
hour. 



524 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Rice Eggs — Sweeten one cup of cold boiled salted rice with 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar, moistening with water until it be- 
comes coherent, then mold a tablespoonful around a preserved 
pear, or other sweetmeat, into the form of an egg, dip this in a 
beaten egg, and fry over a hot fire. A Chinese cook will use a dif- 
ferent sweetmeat, or a different couple of sweetmeats, in each 

egg. 

Cantonese Chicken and Macaroni — Cook half a pound of ver- 
micelli and thoroughly drain. Pour over it half a cupful of high- 
ly seasoned tomato sauce. Shred the white and dark meat of a 
small, cooked chicken into fibers no larger than a match. Shred 
four sticks of celery and mince one Bermuda onion; season with 
salt, white and red pepper, a dash of ginger, cloves and cinnamon, 
and put all in a well-greased pan. Saute over a hot fire; during 
the final heating the various ingredients should be thoroughly 
mingled; when they are, let the pan remain quiet a minute or so, 
until the vermicelli touching the metal is moderately brown. 
Serve plain or with half a cupful of soup stock heated thrown 
over it. 

Oyster-Plant Fritters — Scrape one dozen roots of the oyster 
plant or salsify and so fast as you do so throw the pieces into 
cold water to prevent discoloration. When all are done, cut into 
slices and boil thirty minutes. Drain and mash through a colan- 
der; add one tablespoonful of flour, one level teaspoonful of salt, 
half as much pepper, and two eggs well beaten. Mix, form the 
mixture into oyster-shaped cakes; fry in very hot lard, on both 
sides. 

Orange Pudding — Soak a quarter of a pound of macaroons in 
a scant pint of milk; beat four eggs with a small half a cupful of 
sugar. Mix and beat all until smooth; then add the juice of two 
oranges and the grated rind of one. Pour in a buttered pudding, 
mold and boil one hour. Serve with hard sauce. 

Hard Sauce — Beat to a cream half a cupful of butter, and grad- 
ually beat into it one cupful of sugar. Season with any flavoring 
preferred. When it is smooth and creamy, pile it roughly on a 
pretty dish, place it where it will get very cold, and before serving 
grate some nutmeg over it. Mrs. James MacChesney.

Mashed potatoes. 

Apple pie, with squares of cheese. 

Coffee. 



Fried Eggs with Bacon — Cut two thin slices of bacon for 
each egg to be fried. Fry the bacon over a gentle fire, being 
careful not to burn; when crisp, place on heated platter. If the 
bacon is very fat, remove a portion of the grease into a dish; 
to the remainder add the eggs, one by one. First break up sep- 
arately in a saucer that you may know their condition. Care 
must be taken not to break the yolk. Never turn an egg in 
frying. 

Mustard Sauce — Three tablespoons best ground mustard, one 
teaspoon salt, one rounded teaspoon white sugar, one teaspoon 
of white pepper, two or a little less of melted butter (salad oil 
if preferred). Add vinegar enough to mix to a smooth paste. 

Fried Rabbit — To dress a rabbit, drive a nail through the 
head and secure to some solid wall, say that of a shed. Then 
cut the skin all the way around the neck, make an incision two 
inches long and downward from the throat and gently pull and 
work the skin downward. This way is quite easy and removes 
the coat with all cleanliness. Next wash in several waters and 
cut in eight pieces. Parboil twenty minutes or longer, if the 
game is tough; place on dish to drain, have a frying pan ready 
with drippings (from breakfast), or lard; when these are hot 
put in the pieces of rabbit, which you have first rolled in beaten 
egg and bread crumbs and which have been seasoned with a tea- 
spoonful of salt and a saltspoonful of pepper. (This is inexpen- 
sive, as the cost of a rabbit is about fifteen cents.) 

Onion Sauce — Five white onions, one coffee cup hot milk, 
lump of butter the size of an egg, one-half teaspoon salt and one- 
fourth teaspoon pepper. Peel the onions, boil tender, 
drain and mash fine. Stir the onions in the hot milk, then the 
melted butter, salt and pepper. Allow to boil up once. Serve 
very hot. Mrs. Alida W. Sprague.

cut in very thin slices and butter lightly. Brown bread is ex- 
cellent. Cut in long strips, using a very sharp knife. Put two 
pieces together with the following filling: Cream cheese or cot- 
tage cheese, in which has been chopped olives. These are de- 
licious. 

Banana Float— Place in a double boiler one pint of milk, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar and the yolks of two eggs; add one tea- 
spoonful cornstarch; stir over the fire until thick; then add a 
little vanilla flavoring. When custard is cold beat the two whites 
to a stiff froth, mix with two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Cut three 
bananas into slices and place in a dish, pour over the custard and 
put whites of eggs on top in shape of snov/balls. 

Halibut Steak, Baked — Secure two shapely steaks, wash and 
thoroughly dry them with a towel. Make a stuffing from a cup- 
ful of crumbs, a tablespoonful of butter, a tablespoonful of onion 
juice, one of chopped parsley, a dash of cayenne, quarter tea- 
spoonful of black pepper, just a grating of nutmeg, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt. Place one steak in the baking pan, lay care- 
fully over it the stuffing, and place above it the other steak. Put 
small pieces of butter over the top and dust slightly with salt and 
pepper. Bake until a golden brown, about thirty minutes. 

Caulifiov/er with Dressing — Boil one nice cauliflower for one 
hour in a graniteware or porcelain-lined kettle. Put on in cold 
salted water, with the stem up. When done drain and place on 
a hot platter. Pour over it the following dressing: Rub together 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 527 

a tablespoonful of butter and flour to a smooth paste, add grad- 
ually a cup and a half of cold water. Stir over the fire until 
quite smooth and thick, seasoning with one-fourth saltspoon pep- 
per and one-fourth teaspoon salt, and just before serving add the

put them into a stewing-pan, with two ounces of butter, half 
a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of white pepper; set them over 
the fire until thoroughly heated; turn into a shallow baking-dish 
and break over them six eggs; sprinkle over the top stale bread- 
crumbs; dot with bits of butter; dust with pepper and salt, and 
bake five minutes in a hot oven. Eat with buttered toast. 

Raised Doughnuts — One cup of butter, one cup of sugar, a 
teaspoonful of cinnamon and two eggs, all worked into a quart 
bowlful of bread dough; make as stiff as for biscuit; let it rise 
an hour or more. When sufficiently raised roll rather thin and 
cut into square rings or balls; let stand one-half hour and fry 
in hot lard six or eight minutes. 

Cucumber Sauce — Peel and grate sufficient cucumbers to 
make four tablespoonfuls. To this quantity add an equal quan- 



528 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

tity of olive oil and one and one-half tablespoonfuls of vinegar, 
half a teaspoonful of salt and a saltspoon of pepper. Stir well un- 
til wanted for use. 

Hot Buttered Crackers — Lightly butter a sufficient number of 
milk crackers, and place in dripping pan, being careful they do 
not overlap each other; place in hot oven, and watch them care- 
fully until they are crisped and a light-brown. 

Rice Soup — In a double boiler simmer an hour a teacupful 
of rice in a pint of milk and the same of water, to which has been 
added two tablespoonfuls of chopped onion, one of parsley, half a 
saltspoonful of pepper and a teaspoonful of salt. Just before 
serving press through a fine sieve and add a pint of boiling stock 
and two tablespoonfuls of butter. Serve with croutons. 

Beefsteak and Oyster Pie — Procure a pint of oysters and two 
pounds of round steak, cut an inch thick. Cut it into strips two 
and one-half inches wide. Mix on a plate two tablespoonfuls of 
flour, a heaping teaspoonful of mixed herbs, the same of salt 
and half the amount of pepper. Dip each piece of meat in this; 
place an oyster on one end and roll up loosely; place in the bot- 
tom of a pie dish and pile up well toward the center. Pack the 
rolls loosely, so the gravy may flow through and help cook them. 
Add the oyster liquor and enough stock to nearly cover the meat; 
dot with bits of butter. Cover with a flaky crust and bake an 
hour and a half in a slow oven. For the crust, add a quarter tea- 
spoonful of salt to a cupful of flour; cut into it a half cupful of 
cold lard; when dry and powdery like meal mix through with the 
knife two tablespoonfuls of ice-water, turn out on flour-board 
and sprinkle thick with flour and lightly roll from you until the 
requisite size to fit the top of pie. 

Beet Root and Onion Salad — Take one large Spanish onion 
and one beet root and cook both in their skins separately until 
tender. Let cool and peel; cut in thin slices and pile high in a 
dish, pouring over them a dressing made as follows: Mix thor- 
oughly two tablespoonfuls of salad oil, one of white wine vinegar, 
a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, a saltspoonful cayenne and a 
level teaspoonful of salt. 

Nottingham Pudding — Sift together thoroughly two cups of 
sifted flour, two level teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one salt- 
spoonful of salt, add one and one-half cups of milk, one-half cup 
of cream and four eggs not beaten, and beat until very light and 
smooth. Pare and core six apples, put them in a baking dish 
and if quite tart sprinkle over one cup of sugar. Pour the batter 
over them and bake one hour. Serve with cream sauce, made as 
follows: Cream together one-quarter of a cup of butter and one- 
half cup of powdered sugar. Add two tablespoonfuls of cream and 
the same of fruit sauce. Thoroughly beat and heat over hot 
water, but only just enough to remove the curdled look.

Hominy Muffins — Hash one cup of boiled hominy fine with a 
fork, add one cup of cornmeal, half a cup of milk, two teaspoon- 
fuls melted butter, two teaspoonfuls sugar, one egg, one teaspoon- 
ful baking powder. Beat thoroughly and hard. Put into gem 
pans and bake fifteen minutes. 

Quick Beef Soup — Chop very fine two pounds lean beef, one 
carrot, one onion and one turnip. Put vegetables, with one 
clove, into two quarts of water and boil down to three pints, 
strain and press over the chopped beef. Season with a tablespoon- 
ful of tomato catchup, salt and pepper; boil slowly half an hour; 
color a rich brown with caramel. Serve with meat in it. 

Caramel for Coloring — Put into a saucepan a cup of sugar and 
a quarter of a cup of water. Let them boil until the sirup begins 
to change color; watch carefully. Tilt the saucepan on all sides 
that it may brown equally. When it is all nearly black, before it 
chars in the least, add a cup of boiling water. Let it boil until 
all is dissolved and like very dark sirup. Bottle for use. A tea- 
spoonful or less of this gives a fine color to soup or gravy. It 
will also color icing for cake, and is always useful. 

Breaded Mutton Chops — Trim off fat and skin. Dip in egg, 
then in rolled cracker mixed with salt, pepper and powdered pars- 
ley. Lay in dripping pan with small piece of butter on each. Bake 
half an hour, basting with a little water and butter, and if liked

add a chopped onion. Strain the gravy, thicken with browned 
flour, add tablespoonful tomato catchup, and a little lemon. 

Brown Flour for Thickening Gravy Quickly — Sift a quart of 
flour into a dripping pan, set in a hot oven. Stir well, do not burn. 
When it is rather a dark brown, put in a glass jar. One-third more 
of this is needed than of raw flour. 

Cream Squash — Boil and mash in the usual way. Press out 
all the water. Beat in two tablespoonfuls melted butter, two of 
cream, pepper and salt to taste, lastly a beaten egg. Put into tin 
pail, set in boiling water fifteen minutes, stirring often. Keep 
the water boiling. It should look like rich custard. 

Cheese Canopees — Cut with biscuit cutter from slices of bak- 
er's bread half an inch thick as many circles as needed. Put into 
hot frying pan with two tablespoonfuls butter; fry both sides a 
delicate brown. Heap upon them grated cheese mixed with a 
little salt and pepper and put on top shelf of oven. They will 
brown and be ready to serve while eating the meat course; eat 
with celery. 

Trifle — Half a dozen little sponge cakes, one dozen macaroons. 
Make a thick custard with yolks of three eggs, two teaspoonfuls 
of cornstarch and two-thirds of a pint of milk, sugar to taste. Boil 
the milk, mix the cornstarch with a little of it (milk) cold, stir 
into the hot milk; when a little cool, add the beaten yolks and 
sugar, flavor to taste and set to cool. Lay the sponge cakes in 
a glass dish, moisten with a wine glass of cream flavored with 
vanilla, sprinkle with sugar. Spread a layer of raspberry jam 
over this, then the macaroons and pour the cold custard over. 
Heap the whites of the eggs well-beaten and a little sweetened 
over all. Place near ice to cool. Mrs. P. B. Gehr.

Turkish Pilaf — One cupful stewed and strained tomato, one 
cupful of stock, highly seasoned v/ith salt, pepper and minced 
onion. Boil and add one cupful of washed rice, stir lightly with

Bisque of Oysters— One quart of fair-sized fresh oysters, one 
quart of rich milk or cream, eight soda crackers, rolled, a tea- 
spoonful of beef extract, a saucerful of finely-minced celery, two 
tablespoonfuls of butter, worked into an equal quantity of floUr, 
the yolks of three eggs, teaspoonful salt and one-half teaspoonful 
pepper, with a sprinkle of cayenne. Chop the oysters, put into 
stewpan with their own liquor and a pint of water, the celery, 
beef extract, crackers, salt, pepper and a little parsley. Boil 
slowly for twenty minutes. Rub through a sieve until all mois- 
ture has been pressed through. Return to stove, add milk and 
simmer again for ten minutes. Set back and very carefully stir 
in the beaten yolks of the eggs; serve at once. 

Planked Whitefish — Scale a five-pound whitefish, or two 
smaller ones; cut open the entire length down the middle, with 
a small knife loosen the backbone at the neck until you can take 
hold of it. Gently draw it out; it will come entire with all other 
bones. Rinse fish and lay back downward on a piece of hard- 
wood plank. (A dripping-pan will answer, but has not quite the 
same flavor.) Dot with small pieces of butter, pepper and salt. 
Sprinkle over it the juice of a large lemon. Bake in rather a 
quick oven twenty-five minutes. It must be a rich orown. If a 
dripping-pan is used add half cup of water. 

"Walnut Pish Sauce — Work into a cup of nice butter as much 
lemon juice as it will take. When creamy add half a teacupful 
of chopped pickled walnuts or pickled cucumbers with a little 
minced parsley. 

Roast Turkey with Chestnut Filling — Get a plump, young 
twelve-pound turkey. Singe it over a burning newspaper on a 
hot stove. Draw, being careful not to break any of the internal 
organs. Rinse out with several waters, using teaspoonful of bak- 
ing soda in next to the last. Wipe dry inside and out. Rub the 
inside with a little salt and fill. 

Pilling — Roast about thirty chestnuts; peel, removing the 
inner husk also. Take ten of these with the liver and pound well; 
add a little minced parsley, a sliver of onion, salt and pepper, the 
yolks of two eggs; put this into the crop and sew up. Cut into 
inch lengths five or six links of small sausage that have previously 
been fried in butter until half done; add a cup of bread crumbs, a 
large kitchenspoonful of butter, pepper and salt; add the remain- 
ing chestnuts whole, and fill the body. Sew up with strong thread. 
Tie the legs and wings to the body and fasten securely with skew- 
ers; rub over a little soft butter, salt and pepper, dredge with 
flour. Wrap in slices of bacon and place in dripping-pan. Baste 
often, allowing twenty minutes to a pound in moderate oven. It 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 537 

should be browned evenly all over. Boil the giblets until done. 
Mince very fine and add to the gravy. 

Roast Chestnuts — Boil in plenty of water one-half hour, then 
take them out and place in a pan with holes in it, shake them over 
the fire, first slitting the sides, to prevent them from flying off. 

Chestnut Croquettes (a most delicious accompaniment to 
turkey) — Use fifty chestnuts, two gills of cream, three tablespoon- 
fuls butter, saltspoon of salt, four eggs and some sifted bread 
crumbs for breading. Shell the chestnuts, put into a stewpan with 
enough water to cover them. Boil thirty minutes. Drain off the 
water and pound the nuts until very fine; add one tablespoonful 
of the butter and pound until well mixed; add balance of butter 
and the salt and pound ten minutes, then add the cream, a little 
at a time. When it is all worked in rub the mixture through a 
sieve. Beat three eggs until light and stir into that which has 
been strained. Place in a double boiler and cook eight minutes, 
stirring constantly. It should by this time be smooth and thick, 
if the water in the outer boiler has been boiling rapidly. Spread 
on a large platter to cool. When cold, butter the hands and mold 
into balls or cones. Dip into the fourth egg, then into the bread 
crumbs; fry a minute and a half. Arrange on a warm napkin 
and serve. 

Sweetbread Salad — Select two large sweetbreads, let them lie 
in tepid water a half-hour, then boil in salted water twenty min- 
utes, have water boiling before putting them in, then drop in cold 
water to harden; draw off the outer casing, remove the little pipes 
and cut into small dice. Cut into small pieces half a pint of mush- 
rooms and enough celery to equal both. Mix mayonnaise by put- 
ting the yolks of three eggs into a bowl, beat well and add a few 
drops of oil, stir until it disappears in the yolks, add a little more 
and so on, stirring until the last oil is blended into the yolks be- 
fore adding more. When it is a pale opaque yellow "it has come" 
and the oil can be added in larger quantities. In five minutes 
more it should be as thick as butter and cling to the spoon. Add 
a few drops of vinegar — this whitens it — stir a few seconds and it 
will look like cream, and then add oil until it is very thick again. 
Then add a dessertspoonful of vinegar, a saltspoonful of salt and 
a little white pepper; if liked, a sprinkle of cayenne. Pour over 
the above mixture, reserving a little for the top. Toss and mix 
thoroughly. Spread the remainder over the top, and garnish with 
white celery tips and olives. 

Mince for Pie — Half-pound raw beef, half pound suet, one 
pound tart apples; chop each finely and separately. Half a pound 
of currants, well washed and dried; half a pound raisins, seeded; 
half a pound citron, cut into small bits; half a pound brown 
sugar, half a pint New Orleans molasses, one ounce salt, half 
ounce mixed spices (cinnamon, cloves and allspice, most of cinna- 
mon), one-fourth ounce white pepper, one-half grated nutmeg, 
juice of one lemon, half a pint of cider. Mix meat, suet, salt and 
spices; then add apples, then fruit, then cider, and last of all the 
sugar. Bake the day before, between two crusts of rich pastry. 



538 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

Pumpkin Pie — Pie should be at least an inch thick. Two cups 
stewed pumpkin, one teaspoonful ginger, half teaspoonful salt, 
two-thirds cup of sugar, half teaspoonful cinnamon, two eggs, one 
scant pint milk. Mix sugar, spice and salt together, stir into the 
pumpkin; add eggs and milk. There should be one quart when 
finished. Line a tin plate with good pastry, fill with mixture and 
bake forty-five minutes. To please the children, cut from thin 
pastry the letters spelling "Thanksgiving" and lay on the top 
when half baked. 

Chocolate Cream Cake — One cup granulated sugar, half cup 
butter, one and one-half cups flour, small teaspoonful baking 
powder, whites of four eggs; mix well and bake in square tin. 
Frosting — One and a half cups granulated sugar, half cup of milk; 
boil exactly four minutes; stir until cool or thick; spread on cake; 
melt half cake of chocolate and pour on top. 

Buttercup Jelly — Half a package of gelatine soaked in half a 
cup of water two hours, yolks of three eggs, one pint of milk, one 
heaping cup granulated sugar, one teaspoonful vanilla. Dissolve 
a bit of soda about the size of a pea in the milk. Scald the milk 
in a double kettle; stir in the gelatine until dissolved; strain 
through a coarse cloth. Beat the yolks of the eggs, add sugar and 
pour the boiling mixture upon it, stirring constantly. Return to 
kettle and stir until it begins to thicken. Whip the white of an 
egg stiff. When the yellow jelly coagulates around edges set the 
bowl containing the frothed white in ice water, and beat the jelly 
into it spoonful at a time until it is all in and the sponge is thick 
and smooth. Wet a mold, pour in jelly and set on ice to form.

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 539 

Oatmeal Gems— Mix with one and a half teacupfuls of finely 
ground oatmeal half a teacupful of cornmeal, one teacupful of flour 
and a teaspoonful of baking powder. Mix in a tablespoonful of 
butter, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt and 
two teacupfuls of milk. Bake in a hot oven. 

Sausage Rolls— Make a light biscuit dough with milk, roll 
it out thin and cut into shape with a biscuit-cutter. In the center 
of each place a roll of sausage the size of a good-sized hickory nut 
and roll it up in the dough. After letting them stand in the pan 
for a few minutes, bake and serve hot. These rolls are also good 
cold, and when children we used to have them to take to school 
for our luncheon in bad weather. 

Turkey-Bone Soup — Take the bones and scraps left from roast 
turkey, or chicken, or any kind of game. Lay aside any nice 
pieces, no matter how small. Remove all the stuffing and keep 
that by itself. Break the bones and pack them closely in a kettle. 
Cover with cold v/ater. Add one small onion, sliced; the outer 
stalks and leaves of a head of celery; one teaspoonful of salt and 
a saltspoonful of pepper. Simmer two or three hours, or until 
the bones are clean. Strain, and remove the fat. Put the lictuor 
on to boil again, and for every quart of liquor allow three salt- 
spoons of salt and one saltspoon of pepper. Add one cup of cold 
meat cut into small pieces and half a cup of the stufiing. Or 
omit the stuffing and thicken the soup with fiour. Simmer until 
the meat is tender, and serve at once. This is much better than to 
boil the meat, bones and stuffing together. In that case, the stuff- 
ing absorbs the oil and gives a very strong fiavor to the soup. 

If you wish variety and prefer to use the chips of meat in some 
other way, a few sticks of macaroni, or spaghetti or vermicelli, 
broken in two-inch lengths, may be added to the soup instead, in 
which case the macaroni should simmer at least three-quarters 
of an hour, the spaghetti one-half hour, and the vermicelli fifteen 
minutes. 

Tomatoes (a pint) to a quart of stock make another pleasing 
variety. The bones of a twelve-pound turkey should furnish stock 
for three dinners. Do not throw them away until every bit of 
substance has been drawn out. 

Cusk-a-la-Creme — Take one quart of pieces of cold fish, either 
boiled or baked. Put one quart of milk, with one blade of mace, 
a sprig of parsley and a bay leaf into the milk boiler to boil. Stir 
together one tablespoonful of cornstarch and one ounce of butter. 
Remove the bay leaf, mace and parsley from the milk and stir in 
cornstarch and butter. Add also to the milk the beaten yolks of 
two eggs; one teaspoonful salt and one-half teaspoonful pepper. 
Put a layer of fish in a baking dish, then a layer of sauce, 
and so continue until all Is used, having sauce on top. Sprinkle 
over the top with bread crumbs and put in the oven to brown. 
Serve in baking dish. Mrs. Carl J. Sunde, 

No. 1323 Seventy-second Street, Chicago.

of one cupful of bread crumbs soaked in stock to one cupful of 
finely chopped meat; season with one teaspoonful of onion juice, 
one-quarter teaspoonful each of savory and thyme, one-half tea- 
spoonful of salt and a dash of pepper. Drain the shells and fill 
them with the stuffing, heaping them. Sprinkle the top with a 
few crumbs brov/ned in butter and putting bits of butter over 
them. Place the half-peppers in a deep earthen pie dish, pour 
half a cupful of stock around them, and bake in a moderate oven

thirty minutes. Serve the peppers directly from the oven in the 
same dish they are baked in. 

Creamed Chicken Fricassee with Mushrooms — Cut a fine, 
well-cleaned chicken of three or four pounds into ten pieces; put 
them into a large saucepan of boiling water for three minutes; 
then drain in a colander and instantly plunge into cold water, 
letting them remain five minutes. Take out the chicken, place 
it in a clean saucepan over the fire, cover with boiling water, add 
one heaping teaspoonful of salt, two white onions and a bunch of 
herbs; cover and boil slowly until tender; drain off the broth and 
strain it. Melt two ounces of butter in a saucepan, add two 
heaping tablespoonfuls of fiour, stir and cook two minutes; add 
the chicken broth and half a can of mushrooms, or the same 
quantity of fresh ones, and cook fifteen minutes; then take out 
the mushrooms, remove all the fat from the sauce, add more salt, 
if necessary. Mix the yolks of three eggs with half a pint of 
cream, add it slowly to the gravy, and, lastly, the juice of half 
a lemon. Arrange the chicken on a hot dish, pour over the gravy, 
lay the mushrooms in clusters around and garnish with sprigs 
of parsley. 

Pumpkin Custards — Pare, cut into pieces and cook pumpkin 
sufiicient to make one pint. The first cooking of this is quite im- 
portant. Put the pieces into a kettle; add one-half cupful of wa- 
ter; cover the kettle and allow the pumpkin to steam until ten- 
der. Then remove the lid and allow the water to evaporate. 
Drain this in a colander, then press the pumpkin through, re- 
jecting every particle of moisture. Beat three eggs without sep- 
arating; add to them one pint of milk and then the pumpkin, a 
half-teacupful of sugar, a teaspoonful of cinnamon and a half- 
teaspoonful of ginger; mix and turn into small custard cups; 
stand these cups in a baking dish of hot water and cook in the 
oven thirty minutes. When done turn from the cups and serve 
without sauce. Miss Alice Caskey.

in half orange skins. 

Meat Croquettes — Take roast beef, pork, veal, mutton or any 
cold meat left over from the day before. Chop very fine. For 
one pint of the chopped meat make the following sauce: One 
tablespoonful of flour, rubbed thoroughly with two of butter; 
add this mixture slowly to one cup of boiling milk, and stir until

of baking powder, and lastly stir in the beaten white of one 
egg. Bake in square tins; when done sprinkle over the top one 
tablespoonful of granulated sugar mixed with one teaspoonlul of 
cinnamon. 

Creamed Shrimps on Toast— Wash and drain one can of 
Bavarian shrimps. Put in a saucepan two tablespoonfuls of but- 
ter; when it melts add the same quantity of flour and rub smooth, 
but do not brown. Pour on this a quart of milk and bring to a

not too dry. Before the rice is added the water must be boiling. 
Add to the rice a heaping teaspoonful of butter, and when it 
cools two well-beaten eggs and half-teaspoon salt, pepper and 
nutmeg, if the last is liked. Put the chicken into a pudding 
dish, cover with the rice and bake until nicely browned in an 
oven not too hot. 

Fig Pudding — Take half a pound of figs and three-fourths of

Baked Apples — Pare and core the apples and bake until soft 
(time from one-half hour to one hour, according to the kind of 
apple). For six apples put two tablespoonfuls of water in the 
pan. The hole made by the removal of the core can be filled by 
sugar and a small piece of butter if preferred. Eat with sugar 
and cream. 

Ham Omelet — Separate the whites and yolks of six eggs. To 
the yolks add six tablespoons of milk, a small teacupful of finely 
chopped ham, a few sprigs of parsley; beat hard. Lastly stir in 
gently the whites, which have been beaten to a stiff froth. Have 
ready a tablespoonful of butter heated in a spider, pour in the eggs 
and stir well with a fork until the pap becomes quite thick. In- 
cline the pan, shake so as to bring the omelet near one of the 
edges and begin to fold it. It should be long, thick in the middle 
and soft inside. Time for cooking, five minutes, over a bright 
fire. Cold chicken or veal can be used, in which case a little salt 
must be added. 

Foam Griddle Cakes — One-half pint of sour milk, pinch of salt, 
yolk of one egg, a piece of butter size of a hickory nut, enough 
Hour to make a batter; beat all together for five minutes, then add 
one-third of a teaspoon of soda dissolved in one tablespoon of 
boiling water, and lastly the white of the egg, beaten to a stiff 
froth and stirred in slowly and carefully as for sponge cake. Bake 
immediately on a hot griddle. 

The nicest way to grease a griddle is to use a large piece of 
beef suet tied in a thin cloth. 

Maple Sirup — Maple sirup can be made by melting the sugar 
in boiling water until a sirup a little thinner than molasses is 
obtained. 

Fricasseed Oysters — Put in a saucepan one tablespoon of but- 
ter, and when melted add one heaping tablespoon of flour and stir 
imtil smooth. Add one cup of oyster liquor strained through 
cheese cloth, and when it comes to a boil add one quart of oysters, 
previously drained. Season with three-quarters teaspoon salt and 
a trifle of red pepper (a little nutmeg if liked. When the oysters 
curl on the edges they are done. Then stir in an egg which has 
been thoroughly beaten, and in a minute pour the fricassee over 
hot crackers. This is a very nice recipe for a chafing dish. 

Sweet Pickle Cantaloupe — Cantaloupe pickles should be made 
in September. Pare the cantaloupes, remove the seeds and cut 
in strips. To seven pounds of fruit allow three pounds of sugar 
and one pint of white wine vinegar. Boil the sugar and vinegar 



548 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

together, adding a few sticks of cinnamon and a few cloves; 
boil the strips of cantaloupe in the sirup until they look clear- 
several hours are required. Seal in jars. 

Celery — Celery should be prepared for the table at least two 
hours before using and kept in ice water until the last minute. 
This insures crispness. It is well to take the large outside stalks 
for cooking and use only the smaller inside pieces for the table. 

Baking-Powder Biscuit — One quart of flour, three small tea- 
spoons of baking powder, one-half teaspoon of salt and butter 
size of an egg, rubbed together with tips of fingers. Wet with cold 
sweet milk until a paste is formed that can be rolled out and cut 
into biscuit with a cake-cutter. Bake in a quick oven ten 
minutes. 

Tea — Tea should never be boiled, but the pot should first be 
heated, then the tea should be measured into it and boiling water 
poured over, and after steeping a few minutes it is ready to drink. 
One teaspoonful of India or Ceylon tea makes two cupfuls. 

Barley Soup — Wash two tablespoonfuls of barley and let it 
stand in cold water one-half hour. Cook until soft in boiling 
water — two hours required. Take three pints of soup stock and 
boil the barley in it for an hour. Beat in a bowl the yolk of one 
egg, one-half cupful of milk or cream and one-half tablespoonful 
of butter; add, little by little, while stirring, a cupful of the boil- 
ing stock; then draw the soup kettle to the corner of the stove 
and stir steadily while pouring the mixture in, but do not let the 
soup boil again. Serve immediately. 

Beefsteak Potpie, Suet Crust — Cut in small pieces two pounds 
of round steak, season with a little salt and pepper. Put them in 
a pot with a tablespoonful of butter rolled in flour, one minced 
onion and one quart of water. Cover them and let them stew 
slowly for an hour. Boil six potatoes and cut in quarters. Put 
one-third of a pound of suet into one quart of flour, add a little 
salt and enough cold water to make it a lump of dough. Too much 
water makes it tough and heavy. Line the sides part way down of 
a deep baking dish with the paste rolled thin, then fill the dish in 
layers, alternately formed, of the meat with its gravy, the potatoes 
and squares cut of the paste. Let the dish be full to the brim 
with gravy. Cover it v/ith a crust of the paste, place a small 
paper funnel in the center as a vent for the boiling gravy and 
remove it before serving. Bake one hour in a moderate oven. 

Spinach, French Style — Wash one-quarter of a peck of spin- 
ach and boil it in enough boiling water to float it. A little salt 
should be in the water. Stir it frequently that all the leaves may 
be equally done. Boil fifteen minutes, take it out, drain well and 
chop fine. Prepare in a saucepan one-half ounce of butter, one- 
half tablespoon of flour, two tablespoons of cream or milk and 
a saltspoon of sugar thoroughly mixed. When this comes to a 
boil put in the spinach gradually and let it cook ten minutes (stir- 
ring frequently). Serve hot, garnished with leaves of puff paste 
that can be cut with a tin-cutter from any pie crust and must be 
freshly baked. Toasted bread can he substituted if preferred. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 549 

Spinach, German style, is prepared, in the same manner without 
the sugar. 

Rennet Pudding — To one quart of sweet milk warmed a little 
add one and one-half tablespoons of rennet, stir a few moments 
carefully and let it stand undisturbed in a cold place for three 
hours. Serve in the same dish and eat with a little sugar and 
wine over it, or sweetened cream flavored with vanilla. Rennet 
can be bought at any first-class grocery. 

The best way to flavor with vanilla is to buy two of the best 
Mexican vanilla beans and put them in a quart jar filled with 
granulated sugar and kept tightly closed. Use the sugar instead 
of the extract of vanilla in making desserts that you wish to sea- 
son and a delicate vanilla flavor is obtained. The jar can be re- 
filled with sugar a number of times for the same beans.

Heap the remainder around the edge, making a wall to keep the 
fish and cream, which should then be poured in; garnish with 
parsley. 

To prepare the fish put the pint of milk on to boil with the

Farmer's Rice— Heat in a double boiler a quart of sweet milk. 
While it is heating beat the yolks of two eggs light, and rub into 
them all the flour they will take smoothly. Just as the milk 
comes to the scalding point stir in the thickened eggs, which must 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 553 

first have a cup of the hot milk mixed with them. Stir, and let it 
come to the scalding point again; then add one-half teaspoon salt 
and one-fourth teaspoon pepper and serve at once. Salted wafers 
should accompany it. 

Hominy Crumpets — These must be set over night. Beat well 
together two cups of milk, four tablespoonfuls yeast, one table- 
spoonful white sugar, two tablespoonfuls melted butter, four cups 
of flour and a scant cup of well-boiled hominy. If the large hom- 
iny is used it should be chopped. Add salt to taste, and put in 
a warm place until half an hour before time to bake them; then 
stir in one-fourth teaspoonful soda dissolved in hot water. Let 
them stand one-half hour, then bake very quickly in muflln rings 
or tins, or dropped by the spoonful on a greased baking-pan. 

Buttered Apples — Pare and core eight tart apples (what are 
left can be used for the pudding at luncheon). Put them in a 
baking-dish and fill the hollow of each with sugar, and a tiny 
pinch of cinnamon or mace, if liked. As they cook baste them 
with a tablespoonful of melted butter, in half a cup of hot wa- 
ter. Cover the apples. Boil a cup of sugar and half a cup of 
water, and a blade of mace five minutes; and when the apples 
are tender — not broken — pour this over them after they are 
removed to the dish. 

Oyster Shortcake — Make a rich but delicate shortcake dough, 
using sweet milk and baking powder. Bake in jelly cake tins, in 
rather thin layers and lightly butter each as it comes from the 
oven. Drain one quart of oysters, putting the liquor on to scald. 
Heat a cup and a half of milk and a tablespoonful of butter. 
Rub smooth a tablespoonful of flour in a little cold milk, and 
add this to the scalding milk, stirring until it thickens. If half 
a cup of cream can be had, add it to the milk, it is a great im- 
provement. Put a teaspoonful of butter into the oj^ster juice 
after it is skimmed, one-half teaspoon salt, and one-fourth tea- 
spoon pepper, add the oysters, let them scald until they 
"ruffle," which will be very soon. Then take them out, lay them 
on a layer of shortcake; pour the juice into the milk, stir well, 
put a spoonful of this filling over the oysters, lay on another lay- 
er of shortcake, then add more oysters, pouring the hot filling 
over the whole. The dish should be very hot, and it should not 
stand a minute after being prepared and served. If the cakes are 
very thin and crisp, three layers may be used instead of two. 

Salad of Pigs' Feet — The day before this is needed thoroughly 
wash three pigs' feet, and cook them until tender in salted water. 
When they are tender remove from the kettle and drop them into 
vinegar. In the morning pick out and shred fine and chop the 
meat, using also the bits of jelly adhering to the meat. Add to 
this a large teacup of chopped celery or firm white cabbage. 
Cold boiled potato may be used if preferred. Pour over the salad 
a French dressing. The mayonnaise dressing is too heavy for 
this excellent salad. 

Apple Pudding — Butter a granite pudding pan and put in a 
layer of browned bread crumbs. Sprinkle lightly with sugar,

mace and bits of butter. Then put a layer of apple sauce if you 
have it, raw apples sliced very thin if you have no sauce. Al- 
ternate a layer of crumbs with a layer of apples, seasoning each 
layer well. Let the last layer be one of crumbs. Pour over it 
a very little hot water, cover for fifteen minutes, then remove the 
cover. If baked properly the crumbs and apple will melt into 
a delicious jelly. Serve hot, either with cream or with any good 
liquid sauce. 

Roast Pork with Sage and Onion Stuffing — A leg of pork may 
be used for this, or a loin. If the loin, separate each joint with 
the chopper and make an incision in the thick part of the pork. 
Into the cavity made thus put a dressing made of a cup of 
crumbs, an onion chopped fine, a teaspoon chopped sage, a tea- 
spoon made mustard, one-half saltspoon pepper, one-quarter tea- 
spoon salt, a tablespoon butter, a little cold mashed potato, a 
tablespoon vinegar. Bring the edges of the meat together and 
bind or sew them so that the dressing may not escape. If the 
leg is used the dressing is put under the skin. Allow twenty min- 
utes to the pound and one "twenty" over. Baste frequently, 
especially at first. 

Canary Cream — Dissolve one ounce of gelatine in a pint of 
water. Strain and add to it the juice of three oranges, grated 
rind of one, juice of one lemon, the yolks of four eggs well-beaten 
and a cup of sugar. Stir over a gentle fire until it thickens, which 
will be when it just comes to a boil, then pour into a mold. 

Sauce — Beat the whites of the four eggs very stiff; take a 
good-sized cup of strawberry, raspberry or peach preserve. Beat 
this until the preserve is in tiny shreds. Then add the whites 
and beat thoroughly together. Pile around the canary cream.

tered gem pans in a moderate oven. 

Potato Rusks — At noon, or after luncheon, take one pint 
warm water, one yeast cake, one teaspoonful salt and flour 
enough to make a sponge. In the evening when the sponge is 
light add one cup lard or butter, one cup of sugar and four eggs; 
knead and let it rise over night; roll to the thickness of one- 
half inch, cut with a biscuit cutter and place in well-greased 
pans, so that they will have plenty of room to rise; when nice 
and light, bake. This will make about one hundred and they 
will keep good a week or two. 

Boiled Apples — Select nice tart apples, wash and put them 
in a stew kettle, with stems up; put on enough water to half 
cover the apples, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar for each one; 
cover them while they cook; v/hen they are soft through take 
them up in a deep dish, boil the juice till it is nearly like jelly 
and pour it over the apples. 

Beef Stew with Dumplings — Take two pounds of the neck of 
beef, two onions, six large potatoes, two quarts of water, two 
tablespoonfuls of flour. Cut the beef in nice pieces. Put about 
half of the fat in the stew pan with the onions, and stir for eight 
or ten minutes over a hot fire; then put in the meat and sprinkle

pepper. Stir ten minutes and add the water, boiling. Simmer 
for an hour and a half; then add the potatoes, peeled and cut 
in quarters. Simmer a half hour longer, then add the dumplings. 

Dumplings — One pint of flour, one teaspoonful of baking 
powder, a quarter teaspoonful of salt. Mix all thoroughly and

scrape and cut in rather thin slices, stew in water enough to cover 
them till tender; add a tablespoonful of butter, one teaspoonful

Eggs Poached in Milk — Three pints of milk in a porcelain- 
lined skillet heated to a boiling point. Break your eggs into the 
poacher, set in the skillet and cook slowly on the back of the 
range until firm. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. The milk neu- 
tralizes the sulphur of the. eggs, making them much more whole- 
some to people of bilious temperament. 

Whole-Wheat Bread — Five cups whole-wheat flour, two cups 
warm water, one cake compressed yeast, two tablespoonfuls mo- 
lasses, little shortening if desired. As the flour is added it should

spoonful butter to heat in double boiler. Beat yolk of one egg,

fore it boils stir in the well-beaten white and pour immediately 
over your cabbage, which has been chopped and salted. 

Apple Meringue Pie — For the paste, one cup flour, three table- 
spoonfuls butter, a small pinch salt; chop butter and salt into 
the flour with pastry cutter. Use one-quarter cup ice water to 
moisten; do not touch with the hands. Roll out and bake over 
an inverted pie-tin. For the fllling, one cup sour apple sauce, 
one-half cup sugar, one-half cup water. Let come to a boil. Add 
one tablespoonful cornstarch and cook until it thickens. Fill 
shell when cold and cover with one cup of thick cream, whipped 
stiff. Mrs. Mary M. Pugh.

roll it thin. Spread this sheet with one cupful of butter, fold it 
up and roll out again; fold as before and let it stand a few min- 



564 THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 

utes in a warm place. Now roll and fold twice more. Let stand 
a short time, roll out and cut into biscuits, place in pans, not 
touching; brush over the tops with a little lard and hot water. 
Let rise one hour and bake. These are very light and will pull 
apart in flakes, 

Apple Cream — Two cupfuls grated apples, one small cupful 
sugar, butter size of a walnut, two tablespoonfuls water, one egg, 
orange or lemon peel for flavor. Either grate or finely mince the 
apples and put them into a saucepan v/ith the other ingredients 
and stir them over the fire about ten minutes. Serve hot or cold 
as you like. 

Vegetable Soup — Take eight or ten cupfuls of seasoned stock, 
in which almost any kind of meat has been boiled — the richer 
the better. Skim off most of the fat. Almost every kind of vege- 
table can be used. Take a piece of each and cut into dice shapes. 
Boil the hard vegetables, such as carrots, turnips, onions, cel- 
ery, etc., together in a pint of water an hour in a little saucepan; 
drain off the water, put them into the stock and add the easy 
cooking kinds, such as cauliflowers, potatoes or whatever may 
be at hand, and simmer one-half hour. At last add a half-cup 
tomato, small teaspoonful salt, quarter teaspoonful pepper and 
a tablespoonful cornstarch mixed in a cup of cold water. Cook 
five minutes and serve. In the summer five cents worth of vege- 
tables will be suflicient. 

Scotch Collops in Demi-Glaze — By long stewing and with care 
small pieces of beef, no matter how tough or coarse the cut, may 
become perfectly tender and covered with the richest natural 
gravy without any addition whatever other than plain seasoning. 
Take two pounds of the neck of beef and cut into small but thick 
steaks. Put them on in cold water, with a teaspoonful of salt, 
half as much pepper and boil with the lid on for three hours. 
As the water boils away stir up from the bottom, lest it stick and 
burn. As soon as the water is nearly all expelled, and before 
the saucepan bottom begins to brown, take it off. Put the meat 
on a hot dish. There will, perhaps, be a teacupful of essence of 
meat in the saucepan. Skim off the fat if necessary and pour it 
over the meat for gravy. 

Roast Onions — Peel a sufficient number of onions and steam 
them until done, which will take about an hour and a half. Then 
bake them in a pan with a little drippings, salt and a sprinkling of 
sugar to make them brown on top. Serve them in the same dish 
with the collops, placed around the edge. 

Macaroni with Butter — Boil as much macaroni as you wish, 
salted to taste, in plenty of water, about fifteen minutes. Some 
kinds of macaroni take longer. Drain off the water and place it 
on a hot dish. Take one tablespoonful of butter, melt and pour 
it over the macaroni with a little grated Swiss, or any cheese, a 
little more salt, a large pinch of pepper and serve very hot. 

String Beans, French Way — Drain away the water from a 
can of string beans, put them in a small saucepan and shake 
over the fire without water until they are quite hot. Put in a 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 565 

piece of butter the size of an egg, a half teaspoonful of salt, a half 
saitspoonful of pepper, and the juice of a lemon or a spoonful 
of vinegar. When butter is melted and has become hot they are 
all ready to serve. 

Chocolate Tartlets — Four eggs, one-half cake grated choco- 
late, one tablespoonful cornstarch dissolved in milk, three 
tablespoonfuls milk, four of sugar, half teaspoonful vanilla flavor- 
ing, one-half teaspoonful cinnamon, small pinch salt, a heaping 
teaspoonful butter. Rub the chocolate smooth in the milk, heat 
over the fire and add the cornstarch wet in milk. Stir until 
thickened, then pour out. When cold beat in the yolks of the 
eggs, sugar and flavoring. Bake in open shells, lining patty pans; 
cover with meringue; eat cold. Harriet Mann.

morning add three well-beaten eggs, and half fill each muffin 
ring, which has been well greased and placed in baking pan; let 
rise and bake about fifteen minutes in brisk oven. 

Buttermilk is said to be a wholesome drink for luncheon, 
especially good for corpulent people and dyspeptics. If put into 
clean bottles and canned or sealed will keep for a long time. 

Chocolate Soufl^le — Soak the crumb of a French roll, or its 
equivalent of any stale cake, in cold milk; squeeze it out and 
beat up until quite light; then beat in two rounded tablespoon- 
fuls butter, one-half cup sugar and the well-beaten yolks of four 
eggs; when well mixed add three squares of grated chocolate 
and the well-whisked whites of the eggs. Beat until light, pour

thoroughly done. When tender press through a fine sieve. Mix

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 569 

Graham or Brown Bread Brewis— Heat three cups of milk in 
a double boiler; season with one tablespoonful of fresh, sweet 
butter and one teaspoonful salt. Stir into the milk when near 
to boiling enough Graham bread crumbs to make a porridge as 
thick as ordinary oatmeal. Cook ten minutes. Serve with 
whipped butter and brown sugar, or with cream and sugar. Brown 
bread crumbs may also be used. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes — Chop six large raw potatoes very fine; 
cut an onion into a frying-pan with a tablespoonful of good but- 
ter, or, better still, bacon drippings. When brown add the potatoes 
seasoned with teaspoonful of salt and six free dashes of pepper; 
stir often and fry until all are well browned. Beat the yolks 
of two eggs, take the potatoes from the fire steaming hot, quick- 
ly stir into them the beaten yolks, turn them out on to a plat- 
ter, bank them up into a mound, strew with chopped parsley 
and serve hot. These are delicious. 

World's Pair Gingerbrc^ad — Here is highly spiced ginger- 
bread that will keep for a long time and makes a fine cake for 
travelers' lunch. Thoroughly sift two quarts of flour and one 
even teaspoonful of saleratus together into a pan. Rub into it 
one cupful of butter and one pound of good brown sugar; add 
to the mixture one pint of New Orleans molasses, of the purest 
quality, six well-beaten eggs, one after-dinner coffee cupful of 
ground ginger, one tablespoonful of cinnamon and a teaspoon- 
ful of salt. This makes a soft dough, too soft to roll. Lift it on 
to your board with a knife and spread it to an equal thickness with 
it. Cut into small cakes, lay them far apart in buttered pans and 
bake in a quick oven. 

Arrow-Root Biscuit — Put into a mixing pan two coffee cupfuls 
of arrow-root and one of wheat flour. Rub one small teacupful 
of butter into the flour and one teaspoonful of salt. Stir in grad- 
ually a very little rich milk, just enough to make a stiff dough, 
flavor it with the grated yellow rind and juice of a lemon and a 
few gratings of nutmeg. Roll thin and cut with a biscuit cutter; 
bake in a hot oven and brush each biscuit over with the beaten 
white of one egg and a quarter of a pound of powdered sugar 
whipped together. 

Roasted Onions — Select large onions of a uniform size; do 
not remove the outer peeling, but roast them slowly in a bake- 
pan with their "jackets" on. When tender peel them and lay 
them in a covered dish, steaming hot; heat a large tablespoonful 
of good butter in a pan, rub into it a teaspoonful of flour and 
turn in one-half cup of cream. Heat it hot, but do not scorch the 
butter or let it boil. Add one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter 
teaspoonful of pepper. Turn this sauce over the onions and serve.

Foamed Apples — Six large apples, washed, cored and cut in 
thin slices. Have the skillet very hot and put in the apples and 
place skillet on the back of stove and cover. Keep apples stirred 
so they do not stick, until they are tender and foam up; then add 
sugar to taste. Stir well and let brown slightly. You have a 
delicate dish and no grease. 

Diced Liver — Beef liver, one pound, cut into small squares. 
Have skillet hot and melt therein two dessert spoons butter; put 
in liver and let it cook to a light brown; one coffee cup milk, let 
come to a boil; one full teaspoon cornstarch dissolved to a

mato catchup if liked. 

Spoon Rolls — Three pints sifted flour, one egg well beaten, 
kitchen spoon of lard or butter, two tablespoons white sugar 
(granulated), one-half teaspoon salt, one-fourth of a compressed 
yeast cake dissolved in a teacup tepid water, one pint mild scald- 
ed and cooled. Beat all together into a smooth batter; put in 
bowl to raise and cover; set at bedtime in a moderately warm 
place. In the morning have muffin pans greased, and without 
stirring down take batter out lightly in a spoon and half fill each 
little compartment. Let rise about an hour and bake in a good 
oven about twenty minutes. 

Baked Hash — One and one-fourth pounds of shoulder or neck 
of lamb, lean; cover with boiling water and cook until tender. 
Then take out bones and gristle and chop very fine; add three

THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 571 

spoon of salt, pepper, a tablespoon parsley very fine, a minute 
Quantity of onion if preferred; mix all together, put in baking 
dish; pour over a tablespoon milk, add grated bread crumbs and 
a little butter to brown. Baked twenty minutes. Serve in same 
dish, with napkin folded around outside. 

A French dressing of tablespoon of olive oil, teaspoon vine- 
gar and a little salt is all that is needed for salad at luncheon. 

Split-Pea Soup — Two coffee cups English split peas. Soak 
over night in one quart of water. Have a knuckle of veal or 
beef soup bone and one quart of water; one-half teaspoon of 
salt; add the soaked peas and cook slowly six or seven hours 
until thick as a rich cream. Mash and strain into hot soup tureen. 
A little mace or pepper can be added if desired. 

Beefsteak Rolls — Two pounds round of beef cut one-half inch 
thick, then into rather small pieces so when tied together they 
will be size of a French roll. Cut one inch bread for each piece, 
butter both sides, a pinch of salt and pepper and one clove in 
each (if to taste). Roll and tie each piece of meat around the 
bread. Put in skillet, cover with boiling water and lid. Let 
simmer until tender — three or four hours. Thicken gravy and 
add any seasoning desired — catchup, parsley, soupgon of onion 
and a sweet potato minced very fine add flavor also. Take off 
strings and serve in hot dish with gravy over the rolls. 

Apple Dumpling, Boiled — Cut into small pieces one-quarter 
peck apples, after paring; one pint milk, two eggs well beaten, 
pinch salt, one pint fiour, lightly measured; beat milk, eggs, flour 
together, then add two teaspoons of yeast powder, sifted, beat all 
well, then add last the apples, after flouring them lightly with 
sifted flour. Have ready a pudding bag or tin with tight cover; 
put in pudding and tie on cover, leaving a little space for flour 
to swell. Have a large pot of water boiling as hard as it can, 
and after putting pudding in keep it boiling hard for one hour 
and a quarter. Serve with creamed butter and sugar, a little nut- 
meg, or cream and sugar. It is very light, delicate and delicious 
when properly made. Mrs. Thomas Turtle.

Eggs in Bread Sauce — Slice one good sized onion (Spanish), 
pour boiling water over it and let stand five minutes, then drain 
and cover onion with two cupfuls of milk, add two cloves and a 
quarter teaspoonful of salt, and simmer one half hour. Rub 
through a sieve, pressing through as much onion as possible. Put 
one iheaping tablespoonful of butter and one of flour in a sauce 
pan, and when melted and mixed add the milk and onion and stir 
until smooth; add one-half cup of stale bread crumbs, a quarter 
teaspoonful of salt, a saltspoonful of white pepper and a dash of 
mace. Turn into a baking dish, slip in carefully five eggs and put 
in a very hot oven until the eggs are set. 

Deviled Toast — Use brov/n bread which is at least one day old*; 
cut in thin slices and toast slowly until a nice brown. Spread 
with butter to each tablespoonful of which has been added one- 
quarter of a teaspoonful of dry mustard, one-quarter teaspoonful 
paprika and ten drops of onion juice. Dust with grated cheese and 
set in hot oven for three minutes. 

Hot Kentucky Rolls — One cup oat flakes scalded with one-half 
cup boiling milk; add to these when cold, one-third cup of mo'las- 
ses, one level tablespoonful of butter, and beat for five minutes. 
Thicken with flour, as for ordinary bread, leaving dough rather 
soft. Let rise over night, and in the morning mold into small 
rolls, let rise until quite light, glaze with white of an egg and bake 
in moderate oven. These are excellent, and repay the trouble in 
preparing them. 

Peanut Soup — If you want to try a new soup that has a fine 
flavor and a great deal of nutriment, shell a pint of peanuts, re- 
move the red, paper-like covering (first roasting them in their 
-shells). Grind the nuts to a fine powder by rolling them. Use the 
powdered nuts in a cream soup, made from a pint of milk and a 
pint of water, a small tablespoonful of flour and a large one of but- 
ter rubbed together, one teaspoonful of salt, one saltspoon of white 
pepper. The soup may also be made without milk, using a quart 
of water, and serving with thin slices of lemon in each soup dish. 

Peach Shortcake — Make a rich pastry. Roll thin and bake in 
three crusts in pie pans. Let them get thoroughly cold. If one 
cannot get fresh peaches, use canned fruit; mash well, spread 
between the crusts. Put in a cold place. Serve with whipped 
cream. This is delicious and quite inexpensive.

of eggs; grease a cake tin and well cover it with bread crumbs;

fine; put all the ingredients into a basin and mix well; add one- 
half teaspoonful of salt (scant), just a dash of pepper; add the 
gravy and eggs, beaten; put it into the cake tin. Bake in moderate 
oven three-quarters of an hour. 

Molded Prunes — One pound of prunes, three ounces of granu- 
lated sugar, one ounce of gelatine, the rind and juice of one lemon, 
one pint of water, six drops- cochineal; boil the prunes in the water 
and sugar until quite soft, then take out the stones, crack the

cochineal and the gelatine dissolved in a little water; stir all until 
thoroughly mixed; pour into a mold, set in a cool place till ready 
to serve, when turn it out on to a pretty glass dish. 

Cocoanut Buns — Three-fourths of a pound of flour, one-fourth 
pound of cocoanut, one-fourth pound of white sugar, three ounces 
of butter, two teaspoons of baking powder, one egg, one gill of 
milk and one-half teaspoonful of salt. Cream the butter and 
sugar well together, add the milk and egg by degrees, also the flour, 
baking 'pow'der and* cocoanut; mix well, shape into buns and bake 
twenty minutes. This quantity will make twenty-four buns. 

Dried Green-Pea Soup — One pint of dried peas, two onions, one 
turnip, one carrot, some outside leaves of celery, one teaspoon of 
salt, one-half teaspoon of pepper; soak the peas for twelve hours,

hours; stir often; after that time pour through a sieve, rub all

serve with crisp toast cut into dice. 

Ragout of Rabbit — One rabbit, one-half pound of bacon, one 
carrot, one onion, one ounce of flour, one-fourth teaspoon of pep- 
per; wash and clean the rabbit, cut it into joints and dry the 
pieces in a cloth, cut the bacon in slices and fry in a stewpan; 
when the bacon is done fry the rabbit brown, brown the flour in 
the fat, then stir in one quart of water, add the carrot and onion 
cut in quarters, add the pepper, and if the bacon does not make it 
salty enough to suit your taste add one-fourth teaspoon of salt, 
boil gently one hour and a half; serve the rabbit with the bacon 
round and the gravy poured over it. 

Potatoes a la Creme — Slice the potatoes as for frying and soak 
in cold water half an hour; parboil in a frying-pan, pour the water 
off and let them stand on the fire uncovered till the steam is driven 
off; brown one spoonful of butter and pour over them, then cover 
the potatoes with milk in which they should boil till done; add half 
teaspoon of salt, one-fourth teaspoon (scant) of pepper; watch lest 
they burn; there should be just milk enough when done for a 
creamy gravy, thickened by the starch of the potatoes. 

Amber Pudding — Six large apples, three ounces of moist sugar, 
one lemon, two ounces of butter, three eggs, puff paste, a few pre- 
served cherries; peel, core and slice the apples; place them in a 
stew)pan with the butter, sugar and lemon rind and let them stew

edges of a pie dish with puff paste and decorate it tastefully; add 
the yolks of the eggs to the apples and pour the mixture into the 
pie dish; bake it in a moderate oven about twenty minutes; whip 
the whites very stiff and spread them over the apple; dredge over 
a little white sugar, garnish with a few preserved cherries, then

Frizzled Oysters — Place a frying pan over the fire, into it put 
four tablespoons of butter. To one pint of oysters, use three well 
beaten eggs, and one cupful of cracker crumbs. Mix the eggs and 
crackers together gently, and turn them into the frying pan, then 
turn in the oysters, liquor and all. Add B small saitspoon of salt, 
a third of a saitspoon of pepper. Shake the pan over the fire 
thoroughly, and turn the contents over; allow to cook until the 
eggs are well done, about seven minutes. Serve in oyster plates 
garnished with young celery stalks and leaves. 

Baked Ham — Procure a very small ham. If salty soak over 
night in cold water, scrape and boil gently until tender. Then 
skin it, and remove extra fat. Cut the ham through — with a sharp 
knife — to the bone (on the underside of ham). Remove the bone; 
make a dressing; one cupful of bread crumbs, one tablespoon of 
butter, one saitspoon of pepper and a pinch of pounded sage. 
Moisten with water and fill the ham where bone was taken out. 
Take yolks of two hard boiled eggs, add to them water enough 
to moisten — use the liquor ham v/as boiled in for this — and spread 
over the ham. Grate bread crumbs over all. Sprinkle on a little 
pounded mace, and stick six cloves into the ham, promiscuously. 
Put in the oven in a covered roaster and bake half an hour. Re- 
move cover, sprinkle with a tablespoon of sugar and brown. 
Then slice, evenly, from the end to be served, the first cut. Slip 
on to a serving platter, garnish with rings of the hard boiled 
whites of eggs, hang a twig of parsley or watercress over the end 
of ham, where it is to be sliced, and serve. 

'Cider Sauce for Ham — Mince the slice of ham, toss into the 
roasting pan ham was bake'd in, set over the stove and fry brown, 
into this stir a little more than one tablespoon of browned flour 
and brown together, being careful not to scorch it. Add to this 
one-half cup of cider, if fresh and sweet; if not, use only one- 
third of a cup and an equal amount of hot water; salt and pepper 
to taste. Strain through a sieve. 

Mock Pineapple Salad — Core and peel three nice large apples, 
slice them thin and against the grain of the fruit. Peel two fine 
oranges and remove the thick outside white pulp, slice them rather 
thicker than the apple, and, like them, crosswise. Lay a slice of 
orange upon a slice of apple as near the same size as possible. 
Save every drop of orange juice for the sirup. Place the double 
slices in a circle in a glass dish. Pour the juice you have col- 
lected over the fruit. Sift white sugar thickly over it, also the 
juice of a lemon, or more if the fruit used is very sweet. Splendid.

water and put on again in cold water; boil again fifteen minutes. 
Take from the stove; drain the tripe in a colander. Boil one-half 
cup of rice until tender. At the time of putting on the rice, slice 
and brown in a saucepan two onions in two tablespoons of butter 
or drippings; then add the tripe after draining it in the colander, 
and enough hot water to cover, season with salt and pepper and let 
it cook until the rice is done. Add a tablespoon of curry powder to 
the tripe. Stir it up and dish the tripe with the rice around it. If 
the tripe is not pickled, add a tablespoon of vinegar before tak- 
ing up, 

Italienne Sauce — Put one tablespoonful of butter in your 
saucepan and add to it two tablespoonfuls of shallots chopped 
fine; cook until a light brown. To this add two tablespoonfuls of 
mushrooms, chopped fine and a teaspoonful of minced parsley. 
Cook this five minutes. In another saucepan mix thoroughly a 
tablespoon of butter with one of fiour; to this add one cup of vv^hite 
sto'ck (or broth); season to taste and cook eight minutes. Strain

as may be. Beat to a cream two tablespoonfuls butter, one tea- 
spoonful lard and one tablespoonful sugar. Spread this on the 
dough, double the dough over it, flour it slightly and press it 
out with the rolling-pin half an inch thick. With a knife cut 
the dough into strips flnger length. Lay them close together in 
the pan and bake in a quick oven. They are peculiarly delicate. 

Raised Flannel Cakes — Boil a pint and a half of sweet milk 
and let it stand till lukewarm. Add two large tablespoonfuls yeast 
and pour upon one pint flour, one-half pint cornmeal; one tea- 
spoonful salt and one tablespoonful sugar, mixed well together. 
Cover closely and put in a warm place. In the morning add two 
eggs, beaten separately. Let the batter stand fifteen minutes, if 
convenient, after adding the eggs. Bake on a hot griddle. 

Lobster Chops — Put one large tablespoonful of butter into a 
saucepan, and when it bubbles stir in three tablespoonfuls of flour, 
stir till the flour is cooked, and pour in a cup of cream or rich milk 
and two cupfuls of boiled lobster, cut into dice. Stir till scalding 
hot, take from fire, and when cool add beaten yolks of two eggs, 
one-half grated nutmeg, salt and pepper to taste. When the mass 
is cold form into chops that are pointed at one end, roll in beaten 
egg, then in cracker crumbs; fry in a wire basket in boiling fat. 
Drain well; put a claw into the end of each chop. Serve on a folded 
napkin. G-arnish the dish with parsley. 

Roast Goose — Select a young goose, which can be told by a 
brittle windpipe, white skin, plump breast and yellow feet; the 
web should tear easily. An old goose is known by its red feet. 
Singe, draw, wash and wipe the goose. Beat the breast flat with a 
rolling-pin, draw up the legs and skewer both legs and wings close 
to the body. Stuff with the following dressing: One pint stale 
bread crumbs, two medium-sized onions boiled and mashed, one- 
half teacupful boiled rice, one teaspoonful powdered sage, one- 
half teaspoonful rait, one-fourth teaspoonful pepper, one table- 
spoonful melted butter and one-half teacupful milk. Roast in a 
covered pan, allov/ing rather more than twenty minutes to the 
pound. Baste frequently with the following mixture: One tea- 
spoonful made m.ustard, a saltspoonful salt, a dash of cayenne, a 
large tablespoonful melted butter, a teacupful hot water, a tea- 
spoonful vinegar. This basting is a great improvement. 

Giblet Gravy — Boil the giblets slowly two hours, or until ten- 
der, with a slice of onion, three or four peppercorns and a blade 
of mace. When ready to make the gravy, take two tablespoonfuls 
of oil from the roasting pan of the goose; add the water the 
giblets were boiled in, enough water to finish the gravy, the 
giblets, chopped very fine, and flour to thicken. Boil up and serve 
in a gravy boat. A cup of rich milk improves this gravy. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 581 

Stuffed Onions — Boil fine white onions in slightly salted water 
for one hour, changing the wat3r three times. Lift them out onto 
a cloth and scoop out a portion from the center. Fill the cavity 
with a dressing of two tablespoons bread crumbs, one large 
teaspoon grated cheese, one teaspoon catchup, a little cream, salt 
and pepper. Mash a little of the onion 'with these. Wrap each 
onion in a piece of buttered tissue paper and twist the paper se- 
curely at the ends. Bake in a buttered pan in a moderate oven 
nearly an hour more. Remove paper, put into a deep dish, sprinkle 
a little salt and pepper over and 'pour melted butter over the tops. 

Wild Cherry and Almond Sorbet — One quart water, one pint 
white sugar, juice of one lemon, six sweet almonds, blanched and 
pounded; one bitter almond, a wineglassful of wild cherry sirup. 
Freeze in a freezer; when half frozen add the beaten whites of three 
eggs. Serve in glass cups. The yolks of the eggs can be used in 
the mayonnaise dressing for the celery salad. 

Christmas Pudding — Prepare all the fruit for this one week 
beforehand. Remove all membrane and strings from one-half 
pound beef suet and add to it one tablespoonful butter and one 
ounce chopped almonds; then one large teacup of bread crumbs, 
soaked in milk and squeezed dry; next two cups sifted flour; 
next one ounce each of citron, candied lemon and orange peel; 
one-half pound each raisins and currants, one teaspoonful cloves, 
two of cinnamon, one of mace, one grated nutmeg, one table- 
spoonful salt, one teacup sugar, milk to make a stiff batter — try 
one cup — six eggs beaten separately, whites added last. Flour all 
the fruit, shaking it v/ell to separate the bits. Dissolve one tea- 
spoonful soda in a little hot water and stir in. Let the batter stand 
two hours, then pour into a buttered pail, cover closely and steam 
four hours. Five hours will make the pudding darker and richer 
in appearance. 

Foam Sauce — Beat two cups sugar and three tablespoonfuls 
butter to a cream, add yolks of two beaten eggs. Place the bowl 
in hot water and add, a little at a time, six tablespoonfuls boiling 
water; stir well. It should be, when ready, a smooth yellow 
sirup. When ready to serve turn into the bowl and put the beaten 
whites of the eggs on top. When the sauce is to be helped stir the 
white of egg into the rest. 

"Devil" for Slices of Goose — Scald one cup milk; while it is 
scalding mix with a heaped tablespoonful bread crumbs, one tea- 
spoonful made mustard, one-half teaspoonful salt, one-fourth tea- 
spoonful pepper; add to this one large tablespoonful butter and 
one teaspoonful catchup. Rub one tablespoonful flour and one of 
butter together and stir into the scalding milk; when it thickens 
add gradually to the other mixture, and, lastly, one beaten yolk of 
egg. Return to the fire, heat through, remove at once and spread 
on each slice of goose. Miss M. E. Wright.

Here is bread which strengthens men's hearts. 
And therefore is called "The Staff of Life." 

Perfect Bread — To make good bread, be careful to procure the 
best of flour, as it is poor economy to purchase an inferior article. 
To make four loaves of perfect bread, take two small quarts of 
milk, and heat to boiling over hot water, then set aside to cool; 
when just warm, dissolve in the milk one cake of compressed 
yeast. Sift four large quarts of flour with two level teaspoonfuls 
of salt and two level tablespoonfuls of granulated sugar. Place 
in a large bowl or bread pan, and warm, if the weather is cold. 
Make a hole in the center and pour in the milk and yeast; work 
in slowly the flour with the hand, or a large spoon, and if too soft 
sprinkle with a little flour and knead 'well. Cover, and set in a 
moderately warm place to rise. In the morning, knead thoroughly 
and work in a tablespoonful of good sweet butter. After kneading 
thoroughly, put in four long narrow pans; when the loaves rise 
to twice their size place in the oven, and bake about forty-five 
minutes. The oven should be very hot at first, that the heat may 
penetrate the dough without hardening the outside; bake a fine 
brown, and remove from the pans immediately when done. 

This is an excellent recipe, and was awarded first prize, given 
by a prominent eastern newspaper for the best recipe for making 
bread. 

Fig Pudding— One pint of well cooked salted pearl barley, two 
cups of finely chopped figs (the best), one-half cup of sugar, two 
cups of milk. Mix thoroughly, turn into an earthen pudding dish, 
and place the dish in the oven in a pan half full of boiling water; 
bake slowly until the milk is nearly absorbed. Stir once or twice 
that the figs may be distributed equally through the pudding. A 
delicious pudding, which requires no sauce.

stpoons flour and three of butter; add this to the stock of bones 
left over from Christmas; stir until creamy; add pepper and salt 
and tablespoon onion juice. Serve. 

Pudding a la Grande Belle — This pudding is economical and 
dainty if nicely made. Brush small molds with butter; fill with 
crumbed bread and dried English currants. Beat three eggs with- 
out separating, add one pint milk and four tablespoons sugar. Pour 
carefully over the bread and let stand five minutes. Place molds

Buckwheat Cakes (old style)-^Three pints buckwheat, one- 
fourth pint each of wheat flour and cornmeal, tablespoonful of 
molasses, three and one-fourth pints tepid water, a little salt; stir 
all together thoroughly; then add a penny's worth of baker's yeast. 
Let stand over night and before baking for breakfast add one- 
half teaspoonful baking soda. 

Scrapple — Boil about one and a half pounds each of beef and 
pork until tender; then take from the fire and remove skin and 
bones, retaining the broth. Chop the meat fine and return it to 
the broth and season with pepper and salt. Stir in cornmeal and 
let it boil well as for musih, then turn into pans several inches 
deep. When cold cut in thin slices and fry as mush, though 
not so much lard is needed. 

Maryland Biscuit — Three pounds flour, a little salt, one-half 
pound pure lard, water to make a stiff dough. Lay a cloth on 
the table, dredge well with flour, put dough on it, and beat with 
mallet or hatchet, sprinkling on it a little flour. Roll up and repeat 
for three-quarters of an hour; when it is ready it will snap when a 
bit is broken off. Take off w^at will make a nice size biscuit, 
knead it in the hands until smooth, prick with a fork and bake 
about twenty minutes in a good oven. Mrs. L. C. Cox.

or three minutes and serve at once. To make good chocolate good 
materials are required. 



THE CHICAGO RECORD COOK BOOK. 587 

Fried Pork Steaks — Fry like beef steaks, add pepper and salt, 
or sprinkle with dry powdered sage if the sausage flavor is liked. 

Stewed Parsnips — Wash, scrape and slice pieces an inch 
square; put into hot water and boil until tender; boil the liquor 
down if possible, if not drain; season with salt and pepper and a 
small piece of butter and remove to the back of the stove to 
prevent burning. When ready to send to the table, add one cup 
hot milk. 

Beet Salad — Slice cold boiled beets; cut into neat strips; line 
a salad bowl with white, crisp lettuce; heap the beets in the center 
and pour mayonnaise dressing over them just before it goes to the 
table; or you can pass the dressing vnth the salad in a pretty bowl. 

Pumpkin Pie — Pare a nice ripe pumpkin; slice into small 
pieces; boil v/ith water enough to prevent burning. When tender 
rub the pulp through a colander. To one pint add one pint of 
good milk, two eggs, one cup of sugar, one teaspoonful of cinna- 
mon, one-half teaspoonful of ginger, one-half teaspoonful of nut- 
meg, grated peel of half a lemon. Bake with under crust about 
half an hour. 

Army Coffee — Coffee may be made quickly by placing the re- 
quired quantity of cold water in the pot and adding the coffee, 
tied up in a sack of fine gauze or piece of muslin. Bring to boil- 
ing point, boil five minutes and serve. This is an excellent way 
to make coffee if one does not prefer the French drip coffee-pot.

Nothing in This World 

Is so cheap as a newspaper, whether it be measured 
by the cost of its production or by its value to the 
consumer. We are talking* about an American, metro- 
politan daily paper of the first class like The Chicago 
Record. It's so cheap and so good you can't afford 
in this day of progress to be without it. There are 
other papers possibly as good, but none better, and 
none just like it. It prints all the real news of the 
world— the news you care for — every day, and prints 
it in the shortest possible space. You can read The 
Chicago Record and do a day's work too. It is 
an independent paper and gives all political news free 
from the taint of party bias. In a word — it's a com- 
plete, condensed, clean, honest family newspaper, and 
it has the largest morning circulation in Chicago or 
the west— over 200,000 a day. 

Prof. J. T. Hatfield of the Northwestern Uni- 
versity says: 

''The Chicago Record comes as near 
being the ideal daily journal as we are for 
some time likely to find on these mortal 
shores" 

Sold by newsdealers everywhere, and subscrip- 
tions received by all postmasters. Address The 
Chicago Record, 181 Madison-st. 



One Advantage 

Of Wit in a great city is the ease with which our every- 
day wants may be supplied. . . . This is most readily 
done by a "Want" ad. inserted in a daily newspaper of 
large circulation. 

The Chicago Record 

SELLS EACH DAY MORE THAN 200,000 COPIES 

Ii is the largest — very much the largest— morning circula- 
tion in Chicago; in fact, it is larger than that of any other two 
mornmg papers, probably larger than that of any three in Chicago. A 
common estimate is that each copy of a good daily family paper has 
an average of three readers; it is probably a reasonable approximation 
that the circle of daily readers of THE RECORD includes six hundred 
thousand people. Hundreds of stories of "Wants" are told to this 
reading circle. From two to three pages of such "want ads" are pub- 
lished daily. None of these is padded, fictitious, inserted free of charge 
or copied from other papers the day following its first publication. 
As these advertisements in every case represent a genuine want, their 
value is greatly increased both to the advertiser and the reader.
