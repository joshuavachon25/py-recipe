THE 

ART 

O F 

CONFECTIONARY. 

Of the Manner of clarifying Sugar ^ and 
the different Ways of boiling it. 

r^^"^INCE the Ground-work of the 
^ S ^ Confeftioner's Art depends on the 
k.^$Jtt( Kiiowledge of clarifying and boil- 
ing Sugars j I fhall here diftindlly 
fet them down, that the feveral Terms 
hereafter mentioned may the more eafily 
be underftood ; which, when thoroughly 
comprehended, will prevent the unneceiTary 
A z Repe- 



( 4 5_ 

Repetitions of them, which would encum- 
ber the Work and confound the Practitioner, 
were they to be explained in every Article, 
as the Variety of the Matter fhould require: 
I fl:iall therefore, through the whole Treatife, 
ftick to thefe Denominations of the feveral 
Degrees of boiling Sugar, viz. Clarifying^ 
Smooth, Blown, Feather'd, Cracked, and 
CarmeL 

^0 Clarify Sugar. 

"OR E A K into your preferving Pan the 
-^ White of one Egg, put in four Quarts 
of Water, beat it up to a Froth with a 
Whifk, then put in twelve Pounds of Sugar,, 
mixed together, and fet it over the Fire ; 
when it boils up, put in a little cold Water^- 
w^hich will caufe it to fxuk ; let it rife again, 
then put in a little more V/ater ; fo do for 
four or five times, till the Scum appears 
thick on the Top; then remove it from the 
Fire and let it fettle j then takeofFtheScum,^ 
and pafs it through your ftraining Bag. 

Note, If the Sugar doth not appear very 
fine, you muft boil it again before you 
{train it; otherw^ife in boiling it to 
an Height, it will rife owtx the Pan^ 
and give the Artifl a great deal of 
Trouble, 



is) 

Th IfGilmg Sugar to the Degree called Smooth, 

WHEN your Sugar Is thus clarify- 
ed, put what Quantity you fhall 
have Occafion for over the Fire, to boil 
fmooth, the vs^hich you will prove by dip- 
ping your Scummer into the Sugary and 
then touching it with your Fore-finger and 
Thumb, in opening them a little you will 
fee a fmall Thread drawn betwixt, which 
immediately breaks, and remains in a 
Drop on your Thum.b; thus it is a little 
fmooth ', then boiling it more, it will draw 
into a larger String i then it is become very 
fmooth. 

Hhe Blown Sugar. 

T5OIL your Sugar yet longer than the 
^ former, and try it thus, viz. Dip in 
your Scummer, and take it out, fhaking ofF 
what Sugar you can into the Pan, and then 
blow with your Mouth fcrongly through 
the Holes, and if certain Bubbles or Blad- 
ders blow through, it is boiled to the De- 
gree called Blown. 



r/j€ 



(6) 

^he Feathered Sugar ^ 

TS a higher Degree of boiling Sugar, 
-■• which is to be proved by dipping the 
Scummer when it hath" boiled fomev/hat 
longer ^ iLake it iirft over the Pan, then 
giving it a fudden Flurt behind you ; if 
it be enough, the Sugar will fly ofFlike Fea- 
thers. 

^he Crackled Boilifig^ 

TS proved by letting it boil fomewhat long-* 
-^ er ; and then dipping a Stick into the 
Sugar, which immediately remove into a 
Pot of cold Water ftanding by you for that 
Purpofe, drawing off the Sugar that cleaves 
to the Stick, arid if it becomes hard, and 
will fn ap in the V/ater, it is enough ; if not, 
you muft boil it till it comes to that Degree. 

NotCy Your Water mull be always very 
cold, or it will deceive you. 

The Carmel Sugar^ 

T S known by boiling yet longer, and is 
-■• proved by dipping a Stick, as aforefaid, 
firft in the Sugar, and then in the Water : 
But this you muft obferve, when it comes 



(7) 
to the Carmel Height, it will fnaplike Glafs 
the Moment it touches the cold Water, 
which is the highefl and laft Degree of boil- 
ing Sugar. 

Note^ There is this to be obferved, that 
your Fire be not very fierce when you 
boil this, left flaming up the Sides of 
your Pan, it fhould occaflon the Sugar 
to burn, and fo difcolour it. 

To preferve SevUle-Oranges Liquid. 

'TpAKE the heft Seville-Oranges, and 
-^ pare them very neatly, put them in- 
to Salt and Water for about two Hours j 
then boil them very tender till a Pin will 
eaiily go into them ; then drain them well 
from the Water, and put them into your 
preferving Pan, putting as much clarified 
Sugar to them as will cover them, laying 
fome Trencher or Plate on them to keep 
them down ; then fet them over a Fire, 
and by Degrees heat them till they boil ; 
then let them have a quick boil till the Su- 
gar comes all over them in a Froth ; then 
fet them by till next Day, when you muft 
drain the Syrup from them, and boil it till 
it becomes very fmooth, adding fome more 
clarified Sugar 3 put it upon the Oranges, and 
give them a Boil, then fet them by till next 

Day, 



( 8 ) 

Day, when you muft do as the Day before- 
The fourth Day drain them and ftrain your 
Syrup through a Bag, and boil it till it be- 
comes very fmooth ; then take fome other 
clarified Sugar, boil it till it blows very 
ftrong, and take fome Jelly of Pippins drawn 
from the Pippins, as I fhall immediately ex- 
prefs, v/ith the Juice of fome other Oranges : 
As for Example, if you have fix Oranges, 
after they are preferved as above direded, 
take two Pounds of clarified Sugar, boil it 
to blow very flrong; then one Pint and half 
of Pippin Jelly, and the Juice of four or five 
Oranges, boil all together j then put in the 
Syrup that has been ftrained and boiled to be 
very fmooth, and give all a Boil ; then put 
your Oranges into your Pots or GlaiTes, and 
fill them up with the above made Jelly; 
when cold cover them, and fet them by for 
Ufe. 

'Note:, You mufl be fure in all your Boil- 
ings to clear away the Scum,otherwife 
yau will endanger their Working : 
And if you find they will fwim above 
your Jelly, you muft bind them down 
with a Sprig of a clean Whifk.

^0 draw a Jelly from Pippins, 

'T^AKEthe faireft and firmeft Pip- 
•^ pins, pour them into fair Water, as 
much as will cover them ; fet them over 
a quick Fire, and boil them to Mafli ; then 
put them on a Sieve over an earthen Pan, 
and prefs out all the Jelly, which Jelly 
ftrain through a Bag, and ufe as diredied in 
the Oranges before mentioned, and fuch 
others as fhall be hereafter defcrlbed. 

TJ? make Orange Marmalade. 

^np A K E fix Oranges, grate two of the 
•^ Rinds of them upon a Grater, then 
cut them all, and pick out the FleiGi from 
the Skins and Seeds ; put to it the grated 
Rind, and about half a Pint of Pippin Jelly; 
take the fame Weight of Sugar as you have 
of this Meat fo mingled ; boil your Sugar 
till it blows very ftrong ; then put in the 
Meat, and boil all very quick till it becomes 
a Jelly, which you will find by dipping the 
Scummer, and holding it up to to drain; if it 
be a Jelly, it will break from the Scummer 
In Flakes; if not, it v/ill run oif in little 
Streams: When it is a good Jelly, put it in- 
to your Glafles or Pots. 

B Note, 



p 



( 10) 

NotCy if you find this Compofition too 
fweet, you may in the boiling add 
more Juice of Oranges ; the different 
Quicknefs they have, makes it diffi- 
cult to prefcribe.

Into toiling Water, when a Pin v/ill eafily 
go through the Rind, drain and put them 
into as much Sugar boiled, till it becomes 
fmooth, as will cover them, give all a Bod 
together, adding fome Juice of Oranges to 
what Sharpnefs you pleafe ; you may put a 
little Pippin Jelly into the Boiling, if you 
pleafe ; when cold^ fcrvc them to Table on 
Plates. 



To make Orange-Rings and Faggots, 

T) A R E your Oranges as thin, and as 
•*• narrow as you can, put the Parings 
into Water, whilft you prepare the Rings, 
which are done by cutting the Oranges fo 
j)ared into as many Rings as you pleafe ; 
then cut out the Meat from the Infide; then 
put the Rings and Faggots into boiling Wa- 
ter y boil them till tender ; thcB put them 
into clarified Sugar, as much as will cover 
them i fet them by till next Day ; thea

£ 2 here- 



( 12 ) 

hereafter mentioned, whenever you fhall 
have Occafion. 

51? candy Orangey Lemon , and Citron. 

TTNRAIN what Quantity you will 
^^ candy clean from the Syrup, and 
wafli it in luke-warm Water, and lay it
