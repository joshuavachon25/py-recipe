PREFACE. 



'"Things for the cook, sir ; 
But I know not what," — J^omeo and Juliet. 



In presenting this Book of Recipes to our friends 
we desire to say that it has not been the design of 
the committee to give a complete cook book, full 
in all departments. 

But we trust it will prove an assistance to 
the housekeepers who are engaged in the stupend- 
ous task of cooking for the nation. 

Our sincere thanks are extended to the ladies of 
Monmouth for the recipes. The signatures are a 
sufficient guarantee for their excellence. 

We especially ask our friends to read the adver- 
tisements that they may know who have given us 
substantial aid. We ask for them an increased 
patronage, which their generosity to all our public 
enterprises justly merits.

SOUPS 



SOUPS. 

''Expect spoon meat.'' — Comedy of Errors. 



'The pot must smile but never laugh.''' 



In making soups, put all uncooked meats and 
bones in cold water. If cooked in hot water, adding" 
a little at a time. Use a flat-bottomed pot and 
keep on top of stove. It is better if made the day 
before wanted. When cold remove fat, re-heat and 
strain, adding vegetables as desired. Brown stock 
is made of beef shins and a piece of coarse beef. 
White stock, of veal shins and an old fowl, if you 
choose. One shin of veal will make three quarts 
of good veal stock, one hind shin of beef will make 
five quarts — a piece of each makes the best soup. 
All kinds of bones can be used, and all liquor in 
which beef, mutton or poultry is boiled. Wash 
shins — put on in cold water, skim just before it 
boils, simmer slowly four or fiv^ hours or longer. 
Boil vegetables separately, and add to soup stock 
a short time before serving. Barley, rice, tapioca, 
vermicelli, maccaroni and all vegetables may be 
used separately or together. Also, add the water 
in which they are boiled. Serve very hot. 

To make rice, vermicelli, maccaroni or barley 
soup, boil thoroughly in separate vessel and add 
about quarter of an hour before serving. Cabbage, 
tomatoes or the soup boquet, or other vegetables 
may be also added, separately or together.

lo SOUPS. 

BOUILLON. 

Four pounds juicy beef, one tablespoon salt, two 
pounds bone, one tablespoon mixed herbs, four 
peppercorns, four clov^es, two quarts water. Cut 
meat and bones in small pieces, boil down to three 
pints, season to taste. Add one onion, one-half 
carrot and turnip if you like ; strain and re-heat. 

ASPAR-VGUS SOUP. 
S. 

One bunch of asparagus boiled in a quart 
of salted water for twenty minutes. Press the 
asparagus through a colander. Put a quart of 
milk into a double boiler, adding a little parsley 
and a piece of onion. For thickening use two 
ounces of butter and three level tablespoonsfuls of 
flour rubbed together and thinned by stirring in a 
little of the milk. Then stir into the boiling milk 
and stir continually until it thickens. Have the 
asparagus and water in which it was cooked, hot 
and mix all together. Season and serve at once. 

S. 
CELERY SOUP. 
S. C. K. 

Take four or six stalks of celery, wash and cut 
into small pieces, using the leaves as well, cover 
with a pint or more of boiling water, and let boil 
half an hour. Press through a colander, do not 
drain, but allow the Avater to go through with the 
celery. Have in a double boiler one quart of 
boiling milk and a slice of onion, to this add the 
celery and water. Rub together one tablespoon 
of butter and two tablespoons of flour. Stir into 
boiling soup. Season with pepper and salt, and 
serve.

CELERY SOUP. — NO. 2. 

Take the. white part of two Ia*rge heads of celery. 
Either grate or chop fine, set to boil with a cup of 
rice, in water enough to cover. Allow^ the rice 
and celery to slowly stew until they can be rubbed 
through a coarse seive. Have hot one pint of 
milk and an equal quantity of strong chicken or 
A'eal broth. Pepper and salt to taste, 

NOODLE SOUP. 
Amanda Reichard. 

One egg, two tablespoonsful of water, a little 
•salt, add to this flour to make it just as stiff as pos- 
sible, mixing all w^ell together. Roll very thin, 
and with a cloth under allow it to remain on the 
board about two hours to dry, then fold in a roll 
and with a sharp knife cut very fine, drop it slowly, 
stirring lightly, into two quarts of boiling stock of 
chicken or beef, the former oftener used. Boil 
briskly ten minutes, keeping the pot tightly cov- 
•ered. 

CHICKEN SOUP, 

To one chicken put five pints of cold water and 
a slice of fat bacon, and boil it down to a quart. 
Just before taking from fire, add a cup of cream 
and a little thyme or parsley to season. Thicken 
as usual — one tablespoonful of flour, rubbed into 
one tablespoonful of butter. 

Barley and rice are both nice for chicken soup. 
They should be boiled slowly, in a separate vessel 
and added to the soup about half an hour before 
removing from the fire.

HOW TO ROAST MEAT. 

Mrs. Emma P. Ewing, of the school of domestic 
economy at the Iowa Agricultural College, says : 

In roasting meats of all kinds the method adopted 
should be the one that in the most perfect manner 
preserves the juices inside the meat. To roast 
beef in the best possible manner, place the clean 
cut side of the meat upon a smoking hot pan, 
which must be over a quick fire. Press it close to 
the pan until seared and slightly browned. Re- 
verse and let the opposite side become similarly 
seared and browned. Then put it at once in the 
oven, the heat of which should be firm and steady, 
but not too intense, and leave it undisturbed until 
cooked. The time that should be allowed for 
cooking beef in this manner is twenty minutes to 
the pound, if it is to be rare, less half an hour de- 
ducted from the aggregate time on account of 
searing. In other words, a five-pound roast of 
beef will require an hour and a quarter, a six- 
pound roast an hour and a half, and so on. 

If the oven is not too hot the beef requires no 
basting, and is better without it. When the oven 
is at the proper temperature, and the cooking is 
going on all right, the meat will keep up a gentle 
sputtering in the pan. If, upon opening the oven 
door, this sputtering is not perceptible, more heat 



Hodgcns Pine Apple lee. 



MEATS. 37 

is required. But, if in addition to the sputtering, 
anv smoke isdiscernable in the oven, the heat is too 
intense, and should be lessened. Unless the heat 
of the oven is too great, the drippings in the pan 
will burn and smoke, and when the meat is cooked 
there will be a thin coating of brown jelly in the 
pan where the meat rested, which, by the addition 
of stock or water, will make a delicious gravy. 

A roast of beef should never be washed, and if 
it has been accidentally wet or moistened, it 
should be carefully wiped dry before it is seared or 
put to cook. Searing almost instantly coats the 
cut side of apiece of meat, and prevents the escape 
of juices in the after-process of roasting, while a 
firm, steady heat gently but thoroughly cooks it, 
and thus both juices and flavor are preserved. 
Basting is a troublesome, as well as a damaging, 
process. And as salt and water have a tendency 
to toughen and extract the juices of meat, they 
should not be used on it while roasting, if it is de- 
sired to have the meat sweet, juicy and tenden 

ROAST BEEF. 
M. 

The best pieces for roasting are the sirloin and 
rib pieces. When roasting in an oven dash a cup 
of hot water over the meat; this checks the escape 
of the juices. Baste frequently with salt, and 
water and the drippings. If your fire is hot, allow 
twelve minutes to the pound, if you like the beef 
rare ; more if you prefer it well done. Thicken 
the gravy with browned flour.

TO ROAST BEEF. 
M. 

Put into pan without water, unless in gasoline 

stove oven, when put in sufficient water to keep 

from burning. Do not season. Allow twelve 

minutes to a pound for a rare roast, longer if it is 

desired better done. Make gravy in usual way. 

The best way ever roasted. 

GRAVY FOR TURKEY. 
B. M. 

An excellent way to roast turkey. Wash thor- 
oughly and wipe dry. Do not salt. Fill with 
dressing Put without water in double roaster. 
Do not baste. Keep fire enough to hear a gentle 
sizzle. Bake twenty minutes for each pound. One 
and one-half hours before it is done pour over a 
gravy made of three large cups boiling water, three 
tablespoons flour, first mixed with small quantity 
of water and one-half cup of butter and salt to 
taste. This gives sufficient moisture to the turkey 
and makes delicious gravy, rich and brown, 

A good dressing may be made of bread crumbs, 
butter, pepper and salt, nutmeg, sage, and onions 
if desired, well buttered slices of bread. Make 
about right proportion. 

Chicken is excellent baked in this way. Allow- 
ing at least twenty minutes to each pound. 

POT ROAST OF BEEF. 
B. 
Take four pounds ribbed beef, ribs taken out and 
rolled. Put some beef drippings in porcelain-lined 
kettle, rub beef with salt and put it into the hot drip- 
pings. Let it cook one hour, turning it frequenth', 
then add water and cook one hour longer. Re-

move to platter and thicken the gravy with flour 
.and butter made into a paste. 

GOOD STEAK. 
Mrs. Dr. W. P. Smith. 

In the first place buy good steak — porterhouse — 
have it cut tzvo inches thick ; remove all the bone 
.and most of the fat, put the steak upon a heavy 
hard wood block and with an iron beater — 2 inch 
face and 36 sharp teeth, (mine weighs 2 ft)s.) — 
bring the meat to one- half an inch in thickness. 
JFor a gridiron use a large double bread toaster ; 
■open this and place the steak upon one side, ad- 
justed to the thickness you desire it when broiled; 
close down the other half of toaster, pushing the 
slide clear up, to fasten the meat at the proposed 
thickness, place this over a bed of very hot coals 
for about ten seconds — this seals the surface and 
prevents thejuicees running — turn it and cook the 
• other side done, slightly browning it ; then turn 
the first side and cook that the same — steak should 
be broiled quick, and is best if not overdone, but 
so that when cut 'tis very juicy and a little red in 
centre — unclose the handles of your broiler and 
-with forks remove your steak to a hot platter, 
season nicely with salt and pepper, and place 
about the surface small pieces of butter, put it in 
the oven long enough to melt .this, then to the 
table, and it is ready for the carver. 

SPICED BEEF. 

Mrs. B. 

Take a piece of beef from the fore quarter, 
weighing ten pounds — those who like fat should 
select a fatty piece, those who prefer lean may 
take the shoulder clod or the upper part of the

fore leg — take one pint of salt, one teacup of mo- 
lasses or brown sugar, and tablespoon of ground 
cloves, allspice and pepper, and two tablespoons of 
pulverized saltpetre; place the beef in a deep pan, 
rub with this mixture, turn and rub each side 
twice a day for a week, then wash off the spices, 
put in a pot of boiling water, and, as often as it 
boils hard, turn in a teacupful of cold water; it 
must must simmer for five hours on the back part 
of the stove; press under a heavy weight till it is 
cold and you will never desire to try corned beef 
of the butcher again, your pickle will do for another 
ten pounds of beef, first rubbing into it a handful 
of salt, it can be renewed and a piece kept in 
preparation every day. 

^ TO BROIL A STEAK CHICKENS, GAME OR FISH 
IN THE OVEN. 

K. C. S. 

Place the meats in a double wire broiler, put the 
broiler over the baking pan containing an inch of 
cold water, place the pan on the top shelf of the 
oven, which should be very hot — for sirloin steak, 
from eight to ten minutes, other articles according 
to size and heat of the oven. 

SPICED ROAST. 
Mrs. J. A. Hanna. 

For this either beef or mutton can be used. 
Prepare for roasting by seasoning with salt and 
pepper, then add one half-dozen whole cloves, one 
dozen whole allspice, 3 tablespoons sugar, one- 
third pint vinegar and two-thirds water; roast 
very slowly until about a half hour before serving,

when let it brown in a very hot oven. Baste 
often and add water as needed. 

SPRING CHICKEN. 
Take a nice spring chicken, or a young one. 
Clean and wash thoroughly and put in a kettle with 
a pint and a half of cold water. Let it boil twenty 
minutes, or until tender, but not until it falls to 
pieces. Take out of the water. Sav^e the water 
for the gravy. Split open the chicken on the back. 
Put in a dripping pan, add salt and pepper and 
little pieces of butter. Then dredge it with flour, 
allowing some of the flour to fall into pan. Put 
into a hot oven and brown. Watch it, and after 
it has been in ten minutes— -for if the chicken is 
young it takes only a few minutes — thirty at the 
most. Take out of pan and put on a platter» 
Take the stock, thicken and put it into the drip- 
ping pan where the chicken has just been taken 
out, and cook it until smooth, stirring constantly. 
It ought to be brown if some of the flour and but- 
ter that the chicken was baked in was left. Lastly^ 
pour over the chicken and serve hot. If one has 
an old fowl it must be boiled or hour or two be- 
fore it will be tender enough to split opn. 

JELLIED CHICKEN. 

Mary Patterson. 

Boil a fowl until it will slip easily from the 
bones, let the water be reduced to about one pint 
in boiling. Pick the meat from the bones in good 
sized pieces, taking out all gristle, fat and bones. 
Place in a wet mold, skim the fat from the liquor. 
A little butter, pepper and salt to the taste, and 
one-half ounce of gelatine. When this dissolves 
pour it hot over the chicken. The liquor must be 
seasoned pretty high, for the chicken absorbs.

strain. Then thicken with corn meal and a tea- 
cup of buckwheat flour till the consistency of 
mush. Then dip out in deep dishes, and when 
cool slice and fry a rich brown, as you would mush.

get the onions all done, put in the baked crust and 
set in oven long enough to brown on top. 

ONIONS. 

This healthful vegetable should be eaten oftener 
and would be if it were not for the disagreeable 
odor. The following way of preparing modifies 
this and prevents the burning sensation often felt 
in the stomach. Slice very thin, pour over boil- 
ing water, let them stand five minutes or longer, 
serve with a very little vinegar and salt: excellent 
with salad dressing. 

HOW TO BOIL. RICE. 

Pick your rice clean and wash it in two cold 
waters, not draining off the last water until you 
are ready to put the rice on the fire. Prepare a 
saucepan with water and a little salt. When it 
boils sprinkle in the rice gradually so as not to 
stop the boiling. Boil hard for twenty minutes, 
keeping the pot covered. Then take it from the 
fire and pour off the water, after which set the pot 
on the back of the stove with the lid off to allow 
the rice to dry and the grains to separate. 

Remember — Boil rapidly from the time you cov- 
er the pot until you take it off: this allows each 
grain to swell to three times its normal size and 
the motion prevents the grains from sticking to- 
gether. Don't stir it as this will cause it to fall to 
the bottom and burn. When properly boiled, rice 
should be snowy white, perfectly dry and soft, 
and every grain separate and alone.

BREAD. 

"Nature has meal and bran.'" — Cvmbeline. 



A cook can not acquire a more valuable accom- 
plishment than that of making good bread. Noth- 
ing but experience will secure the name merited 
by so few — ^'an excellent bread maker." The 
first requisite is good flour; the second, good yeast; 
the third, watchful care. There is force in the old 
lament, '*My bread took cold last night," too 
much heat carries forward the process too rapidly 
and the dough will become sour. Correct this by 
dissolving a little soda in warm water and working 
it in well. The oven should not be too hot. If you 
•can not hold your bare arm in it while you count 
thirty, it is too quick. Keep the heat steady after 
the bread goes in. The time for baking is not less 
than three-quarters of an hour, and bread baked 
an hour is more wholesome, 

YEAST. 

Mrs. Seth Pratt. 

Three pints of water, six large potatoes. When 
potatoes are done take the potato water and pour 
over one pint of flour, then add one tablespoon of 
salt. Mash the potatoes thoroughly and mix with 
the flour, and thin with cold water until cold 
enough to put in the yeast. Use two and one-half 
cakes of Magic yeast. 

BREAD. 

Mrs. Geo. Babcock. 

At noon, boil one large potato in enough water 
to scald one cup of flour, when cool enough add

one-half cake of dry yeast dissolved. At night 
add I quart of warm water and make a sponge, 
beating well ; in the morning add one-half cup of 
sugar, one-half cup of melted lard and salt, and 
mix till smooth. Let rise, knead down, let rise 
again, then make into loaves, let rise and bake. 
To save out three or four tablespoons of the scalded 
yeast, before making sponge, is better for the next 
baking than using fresh yeast. 

BREAD. 

Mrs. Seth Pratt. 

One pint of yeast, two pints of warm water, one 
tablespoon of lard, two tablespoons of sugar, mix 
into dough, let it rise, mould, let rise again and 
then mould to put into the tins. 

BREAD, 

Mrs. W. S. Walker. 

Two quarts of flour, one cup of granulated sugar, 
one cup of butter, half cup of lard, one tablespoon 
of salt, one yeast cake dissolved in half cup of warm 
water, one pint of warm water; rub thoroughly to- 
gether flour, sugar, butter, lard and salt, then add 
yeast and warm water, mould into one large loaf,. 
let rise over night then mould into loaves, let rise 
until light, then bake. This will make three good 
sized loaves. 

BREAD. 

Mrs. R. A. Wilson. 

(For inexperienced housekeepers. ) 

Save the water in which your potatoes for the 
noon meal were cooked. In the evening take three- 
pints lukewarm potato water, one tablespoon sugar, 
one tablespoon lard, one teaspoon salt, put this into 
a crock and stir in nine cups of flour and two-thirds 
cup of home-made yeast, or its equivalent in dry

yeast. (Ordinarily this amount of flour is right, al- 
though some flour will do better with d. little less.) 
Set this crock of sponge in flour in your bread pan, 
cover and set in a warm place until morning. 
Then use the warm flour and mix into a stiff dough, 
make it stiff enough so you will not need to add 
more flour to knead well afterward ; set in a warm 
place until light, then knead thoroughly once and 
set to rise again, when light divide into four equal 
parts and make four loaves, or three loaves and 
one pan of rolls; set in a warm place to rise, when 
light, bake in a moderate oven three-quarters of 
an hour. Divide the recipe for small baking. 

BAKING POWDER BISCUIT. 
Mrs. J. C. Dnnbar. 

Sift one quart of flour with two and a half tea- 
spoons of Chapman & Smith's Chicago Yeast 
Powder, one teaspoon salt, and two teaspoons of 
white sugar, mix all thoroughly with the flour, 
sifting several times together, rub in one level 
tablespoon of butter, wet with half a pint of sweet 
milk, handle lightly and cut out with biscuit cutter, 
about an inch thick, and bake in quick oven 15 
minutes. Water may be used instead of milk if 
more butter is added. Handle as little and make 
as rapidly as possible. 

CREAM BISCUIT.

Sift together two or three times one quart of 
flour and two heaping teaspoons of Chapman & 
Smith's Chicago Yeast Powder, work in one table-

loaves. Bread made this way is out of the oven 
by 9 o'clock in the summer time. 

COLD WATER BISCUIT. 

Belle F. Rankin. 

One quart of flour, two tablespoons lard, One 
teaspoon salt, mix up with enough cold water to 
make a stiff dough, beat it with a hatchet until it 
blisters, then roll into little balls, (as for rolls,) 
flatten with a rolling pin, stick with a fork, and 
bake in a hot Oven until a light brown (about fif- 
teen or twenty minutes.) This quantity makes 
about thirty-two biscuits. 

EASY AND SURE WAY TO MAKE GOOD BREAD. 
Mrs. Mira L. ]\Iiller. 

First make the following yeast, which will make 
from twenty-four to thirty loaves of bread, and 
will keep two or three weeks in a cool cellar in the 
summer: Pare and boil six large potatoes, when 
done add enough water to make three pints with 
which scald one pint of flour, stir in mashed pota- 
toes, add tablespoon of salt and water to make as 
thin as batter cakes — have warm as you can hold 
your hand in— add two cakes of Yeast Foam which 
have been soaked in lukewarm water several hours; 
keep in warm place until fermentation ceases — 
about ten or twelve hours. 

To make bread. — In the morning put one quart 
of water, as hot as you can bear your hand in, 
into flour, add one tablespoon of lard, two scant 

See M or roll & Cos ad. on page 4.8.

tablespoons sugar, and One-half teaspoon salt, and 
one pint of the yeast; knead well and put in warm 
place, when light knead again, when light, again, 
make in four loaves and put in pans. Your bread 
should be baked before noon in winter, earlier in 
summer. A two gallon jar heated and greased is 
the best to put bread in to raise.

PUFF PASTE. 

Take equal quantities of flour and butter, befoi'e 
mixing wash the butter thoroughly, then lay in ice 
water, take the flour, adding a teaspoonful of salt 
for each pound of flour, mix into a stiff, smooth 
paste, using ice water for mixing, allow the dough 
to lie five minutes, after which roll large enough 
to work in butter, fold twice so it will be four 
thicknesses, repeat five times, leaving the paste 
about ten minutes each time, then work paste in 
desired form, a cool place is desirable for making 
paste. 

• ' PIE CRUST. 

Three cups of flour to one of lard makes three 
pies. Rub lard lightly in flour: salt. Pour in 
enough ice water to roll out: mix lightly with a 
knife. For lemon, chocolate and all pies of that 
character, bake the crust first, prick lightly with 
a fork to prevent blistering, then add the custard, 
already prepared by coo king in double boiler. Thi s 
is much better than where the custard is baked in 
the pie. 

GOOD PIE CRUST. 

A quart of flour will make four pies. Sift the 
flour with a teaspoon of baking powder; rub in a 
quarter of a pound of lard or butter, then moisten 
with ice water, using as little as will make the 
flour stick together. Do not work it with warm 
hands.

CAKES. 



''He that would have a cake out of the wheat, must tarn^ the 
grinding Hereafter the kneading, the making of the cakes, 
the heating of the oven, and the baking : nay, you must^stay 
the cooling, too, or >ou may chance to burn your lips" 

— Troilus and Crcssida. 



Cake makers often condemn the recipe when the 
fault lies in themselves. Here are a few general 
rules: Always use the best materials. When 
commencing- have all the ingredients ready, weighed 
or measured, the tins lined with paper and greased 
(or grease the pans, have them cold and dust well 
with flour.) For cakes which require [long baking 
use several layers of paper. Use granulated sugar 
dried and sifted. Always dry the flour and sift it 
four times with the baking powder into a dry dish. 
In making anything of the cake kind begin with 
the shortening and sugar, creaming them with the 
hand in a deep earthen bowl to a light and deli- 
cate consistency, adding the yolks of eggs, which 
should be beaten separately from the whites, stir- 
ring them in thoroughly with a wooden spoon ; 
then add milk or water gradually, beating all the 
time. This adding of the liquid slowly prevents 
curdling. Or alternate with flour a little at a 
time. Add flavor, then flour, and finally fold in 
the whites of the eggs, beaten to a coarse froth, 
Stiff enough to cut with a knife, but never to the 
hard, dry froth which some patent Qg^ beaters 
give. Use a fork or wire spoon for beating. In 
the folding process the motion with the spoon is 
from right to left.

A word we wish with every cook

We think is "MAPLE CiTV BROWN;" 

"Superior German" must eclipse, 

The same. is true of "Laundry Chips;" 

The "Alpha" comes a little late 

But takes its place by big "Down WEIGHT. 

We make these soaps much work to save. 

And "Barbers' Bar" for men who shave. 

Now if you would be neat and clean 

And always ready to be seen, 

"Monmouth Oat Meal" we recommend, 

"Maple Boq^uet" will prove a friend. 

With "Cochin Cocoa" or "Pine Tar," 

Or with "Rose Bud" a lovely bar, 

Or with our "AMBER Glycerine," 

The clearest we have ever seen; 

Or with our "Maple CitvTar," 

Or with our nice big "FlYE CENT Bar," 

You'll get results that always please. 

And meet your guests with perfect ease, 

Why use a soap of doubtful worth, 

When we've the best that's made on earthy 

For Maple City Soaps are pure 

And they will please you we are sure.
