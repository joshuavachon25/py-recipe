THE USE AND ABUSE OF A WATCH 



nPHE construction of a watch being very delicate, it is certainly 
very necessary that we should use great care in handling them. 
It requires only a very little thought and careful attention to enjoy the 
benefit of a watch in good running order. It should be attended to as 
regularly in winding as possible. 

The possession of a watch has become universal. It is not alone 
for the mothers and fathers, but the sisters and brothers have them. 
That they are suitable for Birthday, Holiday and Bridal Presents, needs 
no suggestion from us, and when one wisnes to give expression of 
appreciation for services rendered, or of kindness received, a watch 
naturally suggests itself as fitting and appropriate, and whether it be 
to relative or friend, such a gift is always acceptable. The under- 
signed have received the liberal patronage of the people of Paterson 
and its surroundings for many years, and it shall be our aim in the 
future as in the past to present to our customers a full line of the 
newest designs in 

Watches, Jewelry, Solid Silver and Plated Ware, 

FRENCH AND AMERICAN CLOCKS, OPTICAL GOODS, &c. 

Repairing of all kinds done on the premises, with the assistance of 
competent workmen and the most approved appliances to be found in 
connection with any Jewelry Store in the State, 



Established since March, 1864.

INTRODUCTION. 



rr^HE ladies make no apology in presenting to their friends 
-*- this little collection of recipes, as it is intended principally 
for each other's benefit. It has been hastily gathered, but we 
believe there will be found in it something of the ancient hos- 
pitality — the spirit of the hearth-log and crane — for which our 
venerable homes have become proverbial. 

Not many dishes of the olden time can be reduced to print. 
We are glad to crystallize a few, such as Roliches, Souse, Waf- 
fles, Appel Koek, Buhling, but the flavor of good old Dutch 
cookery is not lost, so that what we term our modern dishes 
may be sweetened to the taste of our childhood. 

Time has forbidden the correction of individual manuscripts, 
and most of the recipes appear as originally written. The 
names and initials attached to many of them will disclose the 
fact that we have enjoyed the co-ojieration of ladies from be- 
yond our immediate community, for whose assistance, and 
that of all who in various ways have aided us, we offer our 
cordial thanks. 

PoMPTON Plains, N. J., June, 1883. 



" Of all appeals— although 
I grant the power of pathos and of gold — 
Of beauty, flattery, threats — a shilling — no 

Method's more sure at moments to take hold 
Of the best feelings of mankind, which grow 

More tender, as we every day behold 
Than that all-softening, overpowering knell — 
The tocsin of the soul — the dinner-bell !" 

— Byron. 



It is important to bear in mind the necessity and economy 
of keeping good stock for soup constantly on hand. The 
soup will be better if the stock is made the day before, as 
the grease may be easily removed — an essential item in pre- 
paring good soups. 

To Prepare the Stock. — Buy a knuckle of beef or veal. 
Have the bone well cracked in small pieces. Put in a closely 
covered iron kettle, and, for a medium-size piece, add five or 
six quarts of cold water. Let it come to a boil, then add 
seasoning to the taste, and, if agreeable, a small pinch of red 
pepper. Set the kettle on the back part of the stove after it 
once commences to boil, and keep it simmering gently all 
day. Then strain into a pot kept for the purpose. The 
next morning carefully remove the hardened grease that has 
risen to the top, and you will have a clear, rich stock ready 
for use. 

TOMATO SOUP— No. 1. 

Four good-sized ripe tomatoes, skinned and sliced, boiled 
tender in one pint of water. Then add one small half tea- 
spoonful of soda, dissolved in hot water, and used while 
foaming. Add one pint of boiling milk, set oflE and season 
to taste with butter, pepper and salt. A. V. N. 

TOMATO SOUP— No. 2. 

Take a shank piece of beef with a marrow-bone. Cover 
well with cold water and boil slowly three hours. Then re- 
move the grease, season with pepper and salt, and thicken 



6 DUTCH (reformed) 



with rice. Put the contents of one can of tomatoes into the 
soup, boil up and serve. One can of tomatoes is sufficient for 
five or six quarts of soup. Mrs. J. C. Christie. 

CHICKEN SOUP. 

Take two good-sized fowls, boil until very tender. Season 
with pepper and salt, four or five sliced onions and a little 
parsley. Have on hand plenty of boiling water to add to the 
soup as it boils away. When the chickens are done, remove 
from the pot and cut them up. Have ready, in a spider, but- 
ter nicely browned ; lay the pieces of chicken in and brown 
them. When about ready for use drop into the soup four or 
five potatoes, quartered, and a half bowlful of flour, wet with 
a little cold water. Boil up once and serve. 

Mrs. p. Hopper. 

VERMICELLI SOUP. 

Make a rich soup of veal, mutton or fowls. Season with 
salt, two onions sliced, sweet herbs, a head of celery, cut 
small. Boil until the meat falls to pieces and, if necessary, 
strain the soup. Then add ^ lb. of vermicelli and let it boil 
ten minutes. The addition of a little pearl barley will be an 
improvement. Mrs. Wm. Roome. 

GEEEN PEA SOUP. 
One peck of green peas, four tablespoonfuls of lard heated 
in the kettle ; put in the peas and stir them until perfectly 
green, add pepper and salt and pour in as much water as you 
want soup. Boil three-quarters of an hour ; then add one 
teacupful of milk thickened with one tablespoonful of flour ; 
put into the soup two or three young onions cut fine and fried 
in butter to a light brown. Just as you take it up add 
the yolks of two eggs beaten in a little cream. 

NOODLES FOR SOUP. 
Beat one egg light ; add a pinch of salt and flour enough 
to make a stiff dough ; roll it out in a very thin sheet, dredge 



COOK BOOK. 



with flour to prevent sticking, then roll up tightly. Begin at 
one end and shave down fine like cabbage for slaw. 

Mrs. T. C. Doremus. 

CLAM SOUP. 
Fifty small clams. Take two quarts of water and let it 
boil. Then add two tablespoonfuls of flour, mixed thin in 
water, and boil ten minutes. One pint of milk, let boil to a 
foam. Chop the clams fine and stir a few rolled crackers 
with them in a separate dish ; put in a lump of butter and 
pepper; pour the clams in the boiling water and let simmei- — 
the longer the better. Mrs. Geo. Roome. 

OYSTER STEW. 
Drain the liquor from the oysters and dilute with water to 
make the desired strength. Use one half pint of milk to one 
quart of oysters. Put the liquor, milk, butter, pepper and a 
little salt in the kettle together and let them come to a boil. 
When boiling drop in the oysters. Boil two or three minutes 
and it is ready for the table. Mrs. C. Doremus. 

BEAN SOUP. 
Soak one quart of beans in warm water over night. In the 
morning renew the water and put on to boil with a piece of 
salt pork. When the beans are soft take them out, press 
them through a colander, and put them back in the water in 
which they were boiled. It improves it to add three hard- 
boiled eggs, quartered, just bringing the soup to a boil after 
adding the eggs. When served, cut up half a lemon in thin 
slices, and lay in the bottom of the tureen, pouring the hot 
soup over them. Mrs. W. R. 

VEGETABLE SOUP. 
Four good-sized potatoes, boiled with a small half cup of 
rice in three quarts of water. Add three onions, two toma- 
toes, one large spoonful of butter, a little parsley. Thicken 
with one small half cup of flour smoothed in one tablespoon- 
ful of milk. Season with salt and pepper to taste. 

A. V. N. 



DUTCH (reformed) 



BEEF SOUP. 

Take about two pounds of leati beef, cut it up in small 
pieces and boil about an hour. Then skim off all the fat and 
add two onions cut in small slices, a carrot, some celery or 
celery seed and rice, with seasoning. When nearly done add 
some parsley leaves. Mrs. G. R. 



In boiling fresh fish, clean, wash thoroughly, wipe dry, and 
then sew up in a cloth kept solely for fish, and plunge at once 
into boiling water that has been first well salted. When done, 
cut the threads down the back of the fish and cut the skin of 
the fish, so that in taking off the cloth the skin will come off 
with it, leaving the fish white and whole. Eat with egg 
sauce or plain drawn butter. When you broil fish, grease the 
broiler with butter or lard to prevent sticking. Lay the 
skin side down first. Fish that is to be fried should be 
rolled in fine bread crumbs or Indian meal; that which is apt 
to break in frying may be kept whole by being dipped in a 
beaten egg before it is rolled in the bread crumbs. Pork fat 
gives a particularly nice flavor to fish. 

BAKED BLUE FISH. 

Place the fish in a well-greased dripping-pan, and after 
sprinkling with salt and pepper, both inside and out, place in 
the oven and bake about an half hour. Serve with drawn 
butter and chopped parsley. An egg well beaten and stirred 
in before adding the boiling water improves drawn butter 
for fish. R. 



COOK BOOK. 9 



CREAMED SALMON. 
Put the contents of a can of salmon in a pan on the fire 
where it will heat without burning. Then scald one pint of 
milk, thicken it with two tablcspoonfuls of flour moistened 
with cold milk and add one saltspoonful of palt. Serve the 
salmon on a hot flat dish and heap spoonfuls of the cream over 
it. This is an excellent way of using cold boiled fish. 

Mrs. J. C. C. 

BOILED BASS. 

Wrap in a towel a fish weighing about eight pounds. Boil 
forty minutes in a vessel with water enough to cover and a 
little salt. Serve with drawn butter and chopped parsley. 

R. 
SAUCE FOR FISH. 

Two ounces butter, one tablespoonful flour, three gills 
sweet milk, yolk of one egg, salt. 

Mix the butter and flour cold. Add the milk gradually. 
Put on the fire in a tin saucepan. When it thickens add the 
yolk of the egg not beaten. Stir quickly. Serve hot. 

Mrs. T. C. D. 

CODFISH BALLS. 

One teacup of well-soaked codfish ; two cups of potatoes ; 
one Q^'g ; butter, one-half the size of an egg. Flour your 
hands and make into small balls. Fry in lard. 

Mrs. W.R. 

CODFISH CUSTARD. 

One bowlful of codfish picked up fine. Soak in cold water 
until nearly fresh, put in a saucepan and add boiling water. 
Scald (do not boil) the fish, pour the water off, then take two 
tablespoonfulfi of flour, one pint of sweet milk, added little by 
little to the flour to prevent lumping, and pour over the fish. 
Boil just long enough to thicken. Add one egg not beaten ; 
stir quickly and take off the fire immediately. A nice dish 
for breakfast. Mns. D. N. Jacobfs. 



10 DUTCH (eEFORMBD) 



STEWED CODFISH. 

Put the fish in the kettle with hardly enough water to 
cover them, and let them boil about fifteen minutes. Then 
add a lump of butter, a little cream, pepper and salt, parsley, 
and a little flour as thickening. Mrs. G. R. 

FISH FRITTERS. 

Take any kind of cooked fresh fish, remove all the bones 
and chop it finely with half the quantity of bread crumbs, 
adding also half the quantity of cold mashed potatoes. Mix 
into balls, after seasoning well with pepper and salt, a little 
cream or milk, and one egg, well beaten. Fry the fritters in 
boiling-hot lard and serve on a hot platter, garnished with 
water-cresses or parsley. Mrs. R. R. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

In the first place the cook ought not to be hurried. The 
oysters should be large. Drain them from the liquor and 
lay them on a cloth to dry well. Beat the yolks of eggs, add 
to them a little melted butter, a little cayenne pepper, and 
salt to your taste. Dip the oysters in this, then in cracker- 
crumbs rolled very finely, then again in the batter. Fry in 
hot lard. Have enough fat in the pan to cover the oysters, so 
that they will not need to be turned. 

Mrs. J. A. Slingbeland. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Put one quart of oysters into a saucejjan with enough liquor 
to cover them, set it on the stove and let it come to a boil ; 
skim well and stir in two tablespoonfuls of butter, a little 
pepper and salt. Line some patty-pans with puff-paste ; fill 
with oysters, cover with paste, and bake twenty minutes in 
a hot oven. The upper crust may be omitted, if desired. 

M. E. D. 
SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

Cover the bottom of an earthen dish with a layer of oys- 
ters, pepper and salt, with bits of butter. Then cover with 



COOK BOOK. 11 



finely rolled cracker or pulverized bread crumbs. Alternate 
each layer until you have as many as you wish to use, making 
the top layer of cracker or breadcrumbs, dotted well with 
small bits of butter. Add a cupful of milk or cream and 
oyster liquor. Set in the oven, and brown nicely. Do not 
cook them too long. Miss J. M. YA^r Saun. 

PICKLED OYSTERS. 

For 100 oysters take one cup of vinegar, half ounce whole 
mace, half ounce whole pepper, two lemons, pared and sliced. 
Drain the juice from the oysters, add the vinegar, spices and 
lemon, and let it scald. Pour in the oysters, allowing them 
to stand only a few moments ; then place them in a tureen. 
"Wlien cold they are ready for use. 

CLAM CHOWDER. 

Take 30 large-sized clams, wash them thoroughly and place 
them in an iron vessel or pot, with enough water to cover 
them. Boil until the shells open. Then take out the clams, 
strain the liquor and chop the clams fine. Take half-pound of 
corned pork, chop it fine and fry it brown. Take one quart 
of onions, two quarts of potatoes (cut very fine), one quart of 
tomatoes, and six soda crackers, broken up ; add all to the 
liquor, and boil two or three hours. Season to taste. 

Mrs. Nichols. 

CLAM FRITTERS. 

Fifty clams ; use only the soft parts, cut into small pieces ; 
two well-beaten eggs, one cup of milk. Add flour to make 
batter, as for griddle cakes ; half teaspoonful of baking-powder 
being mixed dry with the flour. Take equal quantities of 
butter and lard boiling hot. Drop the batter in with a table- 
spoon, and fry to a deep brown. J. M. V. S.

A 



TO ROAST A LEG OP LAMB, 

Slice salt pork very thin, leaving the rind on to make the 
piece as large as possible. Make as many of these thin slices 
as will cover the whole leg, then wrap the whole in grape 
leaves, pass a string round to keep them on and roast. The 
lamb will be exceedingly juicy and of delicious flavor. Use 
rich soup-stock instead of butter to baste the meat. 

TO BOIL A LEG OP MUTTON OR LAMB. 

Cut off the shank-bone. Have water enough to cover 
the meat. If well skimmed the water will make ex- 
cellent broth for another day. Lamb is neither good nor 
healthful unless well done. Drawn butter with mutton and 
lamb, and cut parsley added, is an improvement. W. 

ALAMODE BEEP.— Plain. 

Take a thick piece of flank or, if more convenient, the 
thickest part of the round, weighing six or eight pounds. Cut 
off the strips of the coarse fat on the edges, make incisions in 
all parts and fill them with a stufiing made of bread, salt pork 
(chopped), pepper and sweet marjoram. Push whole cloves, 
here and there into the meat, roll it up, fasten it with skewers, 
and wind a strong twine or tape about it. Have ready a pot 
in which you have fried to a crisp three or four slices of salt 
pork. Take out the pork, lay in the beef, and brown every 
side. When well browned add hardly enough water to cover 
it, chop a large onion fine, add twenty cloves and boil it gently 
but steadily three or four hours, according to the size. The 



COOK BOOK. 13 

water should boil away so as to make a rich gravy, but be 
careful it does not burn. When you take up the beef, add 
browned flour to the gravy if it needs to be thickened. 

CURRIED BEEF. 

Put two tablespoonfuls of butter in a saucepan, with two 
small onions cut in thin slices, and fry a light brown. Add 
one and a half tablespoonfuls of curry powder, and mix it 
well. Take three pounds of the best of a round of beef, cut 
into inch squares and pour in one-third pint of milk. Let it 
simmer for thirty minutes, stirring constantly to prevent burn- 
ing. Serve hot, in a dish with sliced lemon and a wall of 
mashed potatoes or boiled rice around it. 

Mrs. J. J. Ball. 

The milk of a cocoanut and a quarter of the meat of the nut 
grated fine and squeezed through muslin, soften the taste of 
the curry, and no curry is ever made in India without it. 

BEEFSTEAK SMOTHERED WITH ONIONS. 

Cut up six medium-sized onions. Put them in a spider and 
fry them brown in butter, pepper and salt. Have ready the 
beefsteak broiled, put the onions over it, cover with a dish 
and put in the oven for a few minutes. Miss C. Van Nkss. 

BEEFSTEAK AND OYSTER PIE. 

Take one pound of beefsteak and one pint, or fifty oysters. 
Beat the steak gently with a rolling pin and season it by rub- 
bing pepper and salt into it. 

Take a deep pie dish and line the upper edges with pastry. 
Put the beefsteak on the bottom of the dish and lay the oys- 
ters over it. Put bits of butter all over the oysters and pepper 
and salt to taste. Boil the liquor from the oysters and strain 
over them. Cover with a rich crust. Bake a half hour. 

Mrs. R. R. 

CRUST FOR MEAT PIE. 
Seven cups of flour, one and a half teaspoonfuls of salt, 
five teaspoonfuls Cleveland's baking powder, one cup of lard. 



14 DUTCH (reformed) 



enough sweet milk to make as soft a dough as can be conve- 
niently handled. This is only intended for a top crust, and 
is sufficient for two ordinary basins. 

Mrs. Martin R. Roome. 

PIE, OF COLD MEAT. 
Mince any kind of cold meat together. Put it about an 
inch and a half deep in a platter and cover it with gravy. Add 
salt and pepper. Lay over it mashed potatoes smoothed at the 
top. Cut it across in diamonds with a knife. Bake till it is 
crisp and brown at the top. Miss A. E. Slingeeland. 

FRICANDEAU— VEAL LOAF. 
Five pounds veal, two eggs, four ounces salt pork, a little 
salt and pepper. Choj) veal and pork together fine. Mix with 
the eggs one dozen small crackers rolled. Make into a form 
and rub the outside with the beaten eggs, and sprinkle with 
cracker crumbs. Bake two hours, basting frequently with 
butter and water. Miss Anna L. Berry. 

IRISH STEW. 

Cut two pounds of the flank or neck of beef into small pieces, 
rubbing them well with pepper and salt. Peel and slice one 
quart of onions. Place beef and onions in a saucepan with 
just enough cold water to cover them and stew them gently 
for one and a half hours. Then add one quart of peeled po- 
tatoes (cut, if large), and boil the stew until the potatoes are 
soft. Serve hot. Mrs. W. R. 

HASH WITH TOAST. 

Toast half dozen slices of stale bread and soak about half 
a minute in water with a pinch of salt added. Arrange on a 
long meat platter. Put the cold meat, which has been pre- 
viously chopped fine, over the fire ; cover with water and allow 
it to boil off. If you have any gravy left from the meat, re- 
move the fat from the top and add to the hash. Allow it to 
boil a few minutes. A few cold potatoes chopped fine and 
added before removing from the fire are an improvement. 

Mrs. M. R. Roome. 



COOK BOOK. 15 



SUGAR-CURED HAMS. 
One quart salt, one ounce saltpetre, quarter pound sugar, 
for twenty -two pounds of pork. Lay the pork on a slanting 
board or table, and rub the mixture on once a week until all 
is used. Mrs. J. .H Slingerland. 

TO SALT HAM. 
Four gallons water, one and a half pounds sugar, two 
ounces saltpetre, six pounds rock salt. Boil all together and 
skim while boiling. Let it become cold before putting on the 
meat. Pack the meat skin down. Miss A. Jones. 

TO SEASON SAUSAGE. 
Quarter pound salt, one ounce pepper, ten pounds meat. 

A.J. 
ROLICHES.— No. 1. 

After cleaning and preparing the tripe for use, cut it in 
strips ; cut beef in small pieces, seasoning with pepper and 
salt to taste ; then put the meat in the strips of tripe and sew 
them up. Boil until a straw can be run through. Put away 
and press. Mrs. Thos. Mandeville. 

ROLICHES.— No. 3. 
Cut beef in thin strips and season with salt and pepper ; 
take prepared tri^je and lay the beef upon it ; gather over the 
top and sew together firmly ; boil until you can stick a straw 
through. Put this in a large wooden bowl and press with 
weights ; then set away in a pot. Slice and fry, or warm up 
in vinegar. Mrs. J. J. M. 

SOUSE. 
Clean carefully a pig's feet and hocks ; boil till soft ; take 
the meat from the bone and chop, moderately fine, season and 
set it away. Fry in vinegar. Mrs. S. P. Roome. 

TO SHAVE SMOKED BEEF. 
Use a very thin-bladed sharp knife, and shave as thin as the 
thinnest paper. Do not attempt to cut across the piece. No 
matter how small the shavings are, if they are but thin. 



16 nuTcu (reformed) 



SCALLOPED BEEF. 

Take cold corned or roast beef ; cut off all the sinew and 
fat, and cut into small pieces not more than half an inch 
square. Line the bottom of a pudding dish with a crust made 
of sea-foam crackers crumbed fine and moistened with milk, 
then cover with a layer of meat, season with pepper and salt 
and sprinkle with bits of butter. Alternate the layers, and 
cover with a crust of crackers, moistened with milk. 

Before putting on the upper crust, add a cupful of nice 
gravy, or of milk and hot water with a small lump of butter. 
Cover with a plate or pie tin, and bake forty-five minutes. 
Remove the covers and brown nicely. 

Mrs. J. C. Christie. 



EilS* 



Poultry will be much sweeter and finer in flavor if allowed 
to remain in cold water with a little soda from 20 to 30 min- 
utes, to extract the blood. Then hang in a cool place for 
twenty-four hours, in winter even longer, inserting a piece 
of charcoal to keep the flesh sweet. 

ROAST TURKEY. 
Make a dressing with six pounded crackers, one teaspoonful 
of pepper, one tablespoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of sage, one 
of summer savory, one of parsley, two eggs, butter the size of 
an egg and cold water to moisten. Stuff the turkey with this. 
Stuff the breast first, and put the remainder in the body. Now 
cross and tie the legs down tight. Run a skewer through the 
Avings, fastening them to the body. Fasten the neck under 
the body with a skewer and bind all with twine. Rub the 
turkey with salt, and while in the oven baste often with the 



COOK BOOK. 11 



drippings and flowr and, occasionally, with butter. About 
fifteen minutes before dishing baste with butter and dredge 
on a little flour. Allow in roasting, for eight pounds, one and 
a half hours, and fifteen minutes for every additional pound. 
Serve with giblet gravy and cranberry sauce. 

A GOOD WAY TO COOK CHICKENS. 
Take two or more chickens and, after cleaning and washing 
them well in cold water, split them down the back, break the

better in the pan, sprinkling pepper, salt and flour over them. 
Put a lump of butter on each chicken, pour boiling water in

as needed for the quantity of gravy desired. Thicken with 
flour. Miss A. E. S. 

AUNT GITTY'S OLD FASHIONED DUTCH CHICKEN POTPIE. 

Vkuy Nice. 

One small bowl of sweet milk. 

One " " thick " 

Half bowl of fat soup of the chicken. 

Four potatoes, boiled and mashed fine. 

Two eggs well beaten. 

Butter the size of an egg. 

One teaspoonful of saleratus. Salt and pepper to taste. 

Mix all together. Then put in the flour and knead 
very soft. Do not roll the crust. Take a lump of the dough 
and thin it with your hand. Have your chicken boiled tender 
with plenty of juice. Take it out and place it in layers be- 
tween the crust as you thin it out. Boil quick and eat hot. 
It is better if not allowed to stand too long when done. 

Mrs. D. N. J. 

TO ROAST WILD DUCKS. 

Wash clean, and fill with a dressing of bread and an onion 
cut into small pieces. Boil until about half done ; then lay 
them on their backs, and spread some slices of salt pork over 
their breasts, and roast. Mrs. G. R.

ROAST QUAILS. 
Quails are very nice to steam until nearly done. Then roast 
in the oven to a nice brown, basting very often with butter 
melted in water. Mrs. J. R. Evans. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES. 
To one chicken and one pound of cold veal, chopped very 
fine, almost to a paste, add one-half a chopped onion, one 
tablespoonful of parsley (chopped), one salt spoonful of mace 
and one egg. Take the same quantity of stale bread crumbs 
as of chopped meat. If you have any gravy or stock, heat 
and gradually stir in the bread crumbs until the bread absorbs 
all the gravy and add that to the meat. The mixture must be 
quite smooth and thin. If not thin enough add a little cream 
or milk ; it will whiten the croquettes. Roll the croquettes — 
egg-shaped or cone-shaped — in an egg beaten with a table- 
spoonful of milk, then in the bread crumbs dried in the oven. 
Fry in boiling grease in a deep pan. When done, put them 
on brown paper to absorb the grease. 

DUMPLINGS. 
Seven cups of flour ; one and a half teaspoons of salt ; five 
teaspoons of Cleveland's baking powder ; one tablespoon 
of lard ; three eggs, and enough sweet milk to make a very 
stiff dough. Have a pot half filled with hot water, with a 
large teaspoon of salt added. Drop the dumplings in, cutting 
them with a tablespoon. Boil about fifteen minutes. When 
done, split them with a sharp knife as you take each one from 
the pot, to avoid heaviness. Mrs. M. R. R. 

TO LAY MEAT AND POULTRY ON THE DISH FOR THE 
TABLE. 

Lay a sirloin of beef with the tenderloin down, and the 
thick end toward the left of the person who carves. A loin 
of veal or a quarter of lamb, with the thick edge toward the 
the carver, and the inside uppermost. A leg of veal, with the 
inside up, and the thick end toward the right hand. A leg of 



COOK BOOK. 19 



mutton or lamb in the same way. A fore-qnarter of lamb or 
a breast of veal, with the outside up and the thick edge toward 
the carver. A ham, with tlie outside up, and the thick end 
toward the right hand. A turkey or goose upon the back, with 
the neck toward the left hand. JBowls on the back, and if 
there are more than one, with the legs toward the carver. 

The sharpness of the breast bone, which is a defect in the 
appearance of a fowl on the table, may be remedied in the fol- 
lowing way : When preparing it to be cooked, take a small 
sharp knife, and passing it up the body, cut off the little slen- 
der bones which join the " hug-me-close " to the side. (This 
is the bone on each side of the neck of a fowl.) Then push 
down the breast bone by pressing heavily upon it. A little 
practice will make this easy. The appearance of a fowl when 
on the table depends much upon its having been handsomely 
skewered. ( .)

a little sugar and salt, adding about three tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar. Mrs. W. R. 



All green vegetables must be washed thoroughly in cold 
water and then dropped into water which has been salted and 
is just beginning to boil. The time of boiling green vegeta- 
bles depends very much upon their age and how long they 
have been gathered, the younger and fresher the more quick- 
ly they are cooked.

VEGETABLES AND SAUCES FOR DIFFERENT MEATS. 
Potatoes are good with all meats. With fowls they are 
nicest mashed. Sweet potatoes are most appropriate with 



32 DUTCH (rEPOBMED) 



roast meats, as also are onions, winter squash, cucumbers and 
asparagus. 

Carrots, parsnips, turnips, greens and cabbage are eaten 
with boiled meats, and corn, beats, peas and beans are appro- 
priate with either boiled or roasted meat. Mashed turnips 
are good with roasted pork and with boiled meats. 

Tomatoes are good with every kind of meat, but especially 
with roasts. Apple sauce with roast pork ; cranberry sauce 
with beef, fowls, veal, and ham ; currant jelly is most appro- 
priate with roast mutton. Pickles are good with all roast 
meats, and capers or nasturtiums with boiled lamb or mutton. 
Horse radish and lemons are excellent with veal. 

Among the little things which are worthy the attention of 
the housekeeper is that of having the dinner served hot. It 
is often the case that a well-cooked dinner loses much of its 
excellence by want of care in this particular. All the meat 
and vegetable dishes should be heated, and in winter the 
plates should also be warmed. ( .)

EGG ON TOAST. 
Brown a slice of bread nicely over the coals ; while doing 
this, break an egg into boiling water slightly salted, and let it 
stand over the fire till the white hardens ; butter the toast ; 
take lip the egg with a skimmer. Lay on toast, dust with 
pepper, salt and bits of butter, and serve while hot. 

Miss Emeline Doeemus. 

POACHED EGGS. 
The eggs should be fi-esh. Have the boiling water in a 
shallow pan, break the eggs separately in a saucer and slip 
gently into the boiling water ; when all are in the water place 
the pan over the fire until the white of each is perfectly set ; 
remove with a slicer, and lay on buttered toast or broiled 
ham. Mrs. J. C. Christie. 

FRICASSEED EGGS. 
Boil eggs hard ; cut them in two, lengthwise ; dispose 
neatly on a hot dish with the yolks uppermost ; pour over 
them simple drawn butter. Ornament with parsley or any 
other green you may happen to have.

SALAD EGGS. 
Take twelve eggs and boil half an hour. Then plunge them 
into cold water, as the shells will then peel off more readily. 
Put again into cold water to prevent discoloration. Cut them 
in halves. Mash the yolk into a fine powder, season accord- 
ing to taste with vinegar, pepper, salt, mustai'd and oil or 
melted butter. A pinch of cayenne pepper is an improve-

Directions for Making Cake. — Place everything you will 
need on the table. Butter the pans, grate the nutmegs and 
squeeze the lemons. Break the eggs, each in a cup by itself. 
Weigh or measure the flour and sugar, and sift them. Make 
your cake in an earthen dish, not in tin. In warm weather 
put your eggs into cold water some time before you are ready 
to break them — they cut into a much finer froth when cold. 
The whites should be beaten separately, then the yolks beaten 
and strained, and then put to the butter and sugar. After 
these have been stirred till they look like cream, mix in the 
flour gradually. In summer do not stir the cake with the 
hand — the warmth of it makes it less light. In winter soften, 
but do not melt the butter before using it. Attention and 
practice will teach when the cake is well baked — when it is 
done enough it settles a little away from the pan. Even 
well-made cake becomes heavy by being taken out of the 
oven before it is perfectly baked. Moving it carelessly while 
it is baking will also make a light cake fall.

Fresh fruits are very necessary to perfect health. Figs, 
dates and bananas, either fresh or preserved, are very health- 
ful, nutritious fruits. The sensible as well as pleasing cus- 
tom of serving fruit as a first course at breakfast should be 
practiced in every house, as far as possible. One nice way to 
serve strawberries is to send the large fine ones to the table 
with the hulls on, and put at each plate a little dish con- 
taining sugar, so that the berries may be dipped in it and 
eaten. 

AMBROSIA. 

Eight fine oranges, peeled and sliced ; half a grated 
cocoanut ; half a cup of powdered sugar. Slice the oranges 
in a glass dish ; scatter the grated cocoanut thickly over 
them ; sprinkle this lightly with sugar and cover with 
another layer of orange. Fill the dish in this order, having 
a double quantity of cocoanut and sugar at the top. Serve 
soon after it is prepared. Miss A. E. Cooper. 

FROSTED PEACHES. 

Twelve large rich peaches ; whites of three eggs, whipped 
to a standing froth ; two tablespoons of water ; one cup of 
powdered sugar. Put the water and beaten whites together, 
dip in each peach when you have rubbed off the fur and roll 
in the powdered sugar. Set carefully on the stem-end upon 
white paper, laid on a waiter in a sunny window. When half 
dry, roll again in sugar ; expose to sun and breeze until dry ; 
then put them in a cool, dry place until ready to arrange in a 
glass dish for the table. Miss Maey S.

EXCELLENT BAKED APPLES. 

Take ten or twelve good-sized, juicy apples, pare and core 
them. Butter the dish, put the apples in and fill the cavities 
with sugar. Take a half teacup of butter and a tablespoon 
of flour, rubbed together until smooth ; to this add enough 
boiling water to make it thin enough to cover the apples. 
Grate nutmeg over them. Miss Elmira Dullegae. 

RHUBARB SAUCE. 

Strip the thin skin from the rhubarb ; cut the stalk into 
pieces about an inch long ; wash and put in a stew-pan, cover- 
ing with boiling water ; in an hour, pour off the water. To 
each quart of rhubarb add one-foui-th of a cupful of water and 
one large cupful of sugar ; stew up quickly and cool in an 
earthen dish. This gives a light green sauce. L. A. W. 



COOK BOOK. 89 




FOR CANNING PINE- APPLES. 
Take one dozen pine-apples, peel and slice. Put tliem in a 
chopping bowl, add five pounds of granulated sugar and then 
chop quite fine. Put in cans ; set the cans in a kettle of 
cold water and let it boil thirty minutes. Then take them 
off and seal. Mrs. R. A. 

QUINCE MARMALADE. 
Cut in quarters ; boil until tender in a small quantity of 
water ; put through a fine sieve. To every pint of pulp, add 
one pound of sugar, and boil about half an hour, stirring 
frequently. It should be thick and firm when cold. 
PINEAPPLE MARIVIALADE. 
Peel and grate the pine-apples, adding an equal weight of 
sugar. Let it boil gently about twenty minutes. 
FRUIT JELLIES. 
To every pint of juice, add one pound of sugar. Fruit not 
too ripe is better for jellies. When the juice is ready and 
has boiled fifteen minutes, add sugar that has also been 
heated. Then take off and pour in glasses. Mrs. J. R. E. 
PIPPIN APPLE JELLY. 
Wash and quarter some pippin apples ; stew them until 
soft ; then strain. Take one pound of sugar to a pint of juice. 
Flavor with lemon. Boil fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Mrs. J. D. B. 
BRANDY PEACHES. 
Seven lbs. sugar to nine lbs. peaches ; one quart of brandy. 
Boil them in water till you can stick a fork in them easily. 
Take them out and pour the brandy over them. Let them 
stand until you have dissolved the sugar, and allowed it to 
boil one minute ; then pour it over the peaches.

Some of the first necessities of the sick are quiet, fresh air 
and cleanliness ; the next is proper food, properly cooked and 
given at the right time. Keep plenty of fresh air in the sick- 
room ; keep it clean and quiet. Wash the patient every day; 
if there is fever use a little soda in the water, only washing a 
small part of the body at a time and keeping the rest covered. 
Use a sponge and a soft towel, keeping both sponge and tow- 
els perfectly clean and fresh. Do not lohisper nor walk on 
tip-toe in a sick-room. If you have anything to say that you 
do not wish the patient to hear, leave the room. Do not cook 
much of anything. A well person tires of one dish soon, and 
a sick person is much more liable to do so. Do not keep a 
patient waiting for his food. 

BEEF TEA. 
Cut half a pound of lean beef into very small pieces — do 
not have a grain of fat on it — and put into a wide-necked bot- 
tle or fruit jar; put in half a cup of cold water and cork tight. 
Set this in a basin of cold water and place on the fire, where 
it will come to a boiling point, but not boil ; keep it at this 
temperature for two hours ; then strain and season with salt. 
This mode of making beef tea concentrates the nourishment 
more than any other. 

ANOTHER WAY. 
[Furnished by a Physician.'\ 
Take a piece of beef cut from the round ; take off every 
particle of fat, then cut it into pieces about an inch square and 



COOK BOOK. 93 



put into cold water in the proportion of a pint to tlie pound. 
After standing a half or three-quarters of an hour, set it on 
the fire and boil it slowly several hours. If the water boils 
away add more cold water, so there will be a pint of tea for 
every pound of beef. Strain it, add salt, and black pepper 
also, if the case permits. 

BEEF JUICE. 
Take a choice steak, remove the fat, put on the broiler and 
heat through ; then press out the juice and add a little salt. 
This can be fed with a spoon to one that is too weak to raise 
the head or care to eat, and it is very nourishing. 

Miss E. S. 

CHICKEN PANADA. 
Boil a young chicken half an hour in a quart of water ; then 
remove the skin , cut off the white meat and when cold, put it 
into a mortar with a spoonful or two of the water in which it 
was boiled, and pound it to a paste. Season it with salt and 
a very little nutmeg ; add a little more of the water and boil 
it up three or four minutes. It should be of such a consist- 
ency that it can be drank, though rather thick. The bones 
which remain may be returned to the water in which the 
chicken was boiled, and, with the addition of rice, a good 
broth be made of it. 

BAKED SQUASH.— Fob Dyspeptics. 

Take a Boston squash, clean, cut in two and remove the 
seeds ; then, putting the halves together and making a small 
opening in the stem-end, place upright in a tin dish and bake 
in a moderate oven. When done, scrape from the rind and 
serve. 

Baked potatoes and parsnips are good. Miss E. S. 

CORN TEA. 
Brown and pound in a mortar one cup of sweet dry corn ; 
pour on this two cups of boiling water and steep fifteen min- 
utes. This is very light and nutritious and can be taken when 
the patient is very weak. 



94 DUTCH (refoemed) 



CREAM TOAST. 

Let half a cup of cream come to a boil and season with salt. 
Have two slices of bread toasted a nice brown ; dip them in the 
cream and dish, pouring the remaining cream over them. 
Serve immediately. 

RICE COFFEE. 

Brown rice as you would the coffee bean and then grind in 
a mill or mortar ; take half a cup of the powder, pour a quart 
of boiling water on it and let it stand for ten or fifteen min- 
utes ; strain; sweeten with loaf sugar and season with boiled 
milk. Drink of this freely. This is particularly nice for 
children. 

APPLE TEA. 

Roast sour apples and pour boiling water upon them. Let 
them stand till the water is cold. It is a refreshing drink. 

CRUST COFFEE. 
Take a large crust of bread, brown or Graham; dry it in 
the toaster and at last almost burn both sides ; lay it in a 
saucepan and pour boiling water on it ; boil it up a minute or 
two and then strain off the coffee ; return it to the saucepan 
with a little milk or cream and boil it up again. It should 
be made strong enough to look like real coffee, of which it is 
a very good imitation when well made. 

A GOOD DRINK FOR THE LUNGS. 

Wash clean a few pieces of Irish moss ; put it in a pitcher 
and pour over it two cups of boiling water. Set where it will 
keep at the boiling-point, but not boil, for two hours. Strain, 
and squeeze into it the juice of one lemon. Sweeten to taste. 
If the patient cannot take lemon, flavor with vanilla, wine, or 
nutmeg. 

CURE FOR HOARSENESS. 

Bake a lemon or sour orange for twenty minutes in a mod- 
erate oven, then open it at one end and dig out the pulp ; 
sweeten this with sugar and eat. This will cure hoarseness 
and remove pressure from the lungs. Mrs. W. R. 



COOK BOOK. 95 



ARROWROOT. 

The best kinds of arrowroot are the Jamaica and Bermuda. 
Wet a large teaspoonful in a little cold water, with half a 
teaspoonful of salt ; pour on it half a pint of boiling water, 
stirring it very fast ; then set it where it will just boil up for 
one minute ; sweeten it, and add milk, if it is allowed. For 
a drink, make it very thin and put in lemon juice and sugar. 

SIMPLE WINE WHEY. 
Take equal quantities of wine, water and milk ; warm the 
water and milk, then add the wine and sweeten. 

WINE WHEY. 
One pint of boiling water ; two wineglasses of wine. Boil 
them one minute, stirring constantly ; take out the curd, 
sweeten and flavor to taste. Mrs. Quinlak. 

BARLEY WATER. 
Two ounces of pearl barley ; two quarts of boiling water ; 
boil to one-half the qunntity and strain, A little lemon juice 
and sugar may be added. To be freely taken in febrile dis- 
orders. Mrs. Wm. Roome. 

EGG TEA AND COFFEE. 
Beat the yolk of an egg with a spoonful of sugar and put it 
to a teacup of cold tea or coffee ; add half a teacup of water, 
cold in summer and boiling in winter, and as much cream ; 
then whip the white of an egg to a stiff froth and stir it in. 

SLIPPERY ELM TEA. 
Take an ounce of the sliced bark, or a large tablespoon ful 
of the flour of the bark, wet with cold water ; pour on a pint 
of boiling water, let it stand awhile and then strain. This may 
be used freely in fevers, influenza, coughs, inflammation of the 
lungs, etc. To make it more nutritious, increase the quantity 
of bark ; add sugar and flavor as desired. 

TAPIOCA JELLY. 
One cupful of tapioca ; wash it thoroughly and soak in 
water from six. to ten hours ; then simmer it in the same 



96 DtJTCH (reformed) 



water in which it has been soaked, with a pinch of salt, until 
it becomes transparent ; then add lemon juice, loaf sugar and 
wine to flavor it. Let this all simmer together, and pour into 
glasses to cool. Mrs. W. Roome, 

CURE FOR A COLD. 
Take one pint of Jamaica rum, and a quarter ounce of oil 
of tar ; put in a bottle together and mix well ; put ten cents 
worth of hoarhound to one pint of water, and boil down to 
half a pint. Mix all together, and sweeten with half a pound 
of strained honey. Take one tablespoonful thi-ee or four 
times a day. Mrs. Austin Dorbmus. 

COUGH SYRUP. 

Two tablespoonfuls of tar, ten cents worth of stick liquo- 
rice, two quarts of water ; boil an hour and a half, sti'ain, add 
one pound of dark brown sugar. Boil slowly for three hours. 
Dose, half a teaspoonful night and morning. 

Miss M. F. V. 
EXCELLENT SYRUP. 

Ten cents worth each of senna and manna, of liquorice 
root and of anise seed ; put on three quarts of water, boil 
down to two quarts, strain and add one quart of N. O. 
molasses. Boil until a nice syrup. Miss E. D. 

BLACKBERRY BRANDY. 
Eight quarts of water and four quarts of blackberry juice, 
boiled togetlier ; then add two pounds of sugar and half a 
pint of brandy. 

ELDERBERRY OR CURRANT WINE. 
Two quarts of water, one quart of juice, three pounds of 
sugar ; put in a keg or jug, let it stand two weeks to ferment, 
strain and bottle for use. 

LEMON BRANDY. 
Put the yellow rind of two fine fresh lemons into a bottle 
of brandy, and after two days strain it ; boil two ounces of

TO TAKE OUT MILDEW. 
[This and the folloviing recipe are furnished by a chemist] 
Obtain the dryest chloride of lime that can be bought, and, 
for strong fabrics dissolve four tablespoonfuls in half a pint 
of water. Let the mildewed article lie fifteen minutes in this 
solution ; then take it out, wring it gently and put it imme- 
diately into weak muriatic acid, one part of the acid and four 
parts of soft water. For delicate fabrics, laces, muslins, etc., 
the solution of lime should be diluted by the addition of three 
or four times the measure of water. Let the article lie in it 
five minutes, then put it into the muriatic acid. 

TO TAKE OUT IRON-MOULD. 

Dissolve a teaspoonful of salts of tin in two tablespoons of 
water. Dip the iron-mould into the solution and let it remain 
five minutes. Then dip it into a mixture of equal parts of 
muriatic acid and water. Dip the mould spots alternately 
into these mixtures or make the first one stronger with the 
salts of tin, and apply it with a soft rag on the end of a stick. 
Last of all, rinse the article very thoroughly in cold water. 

A simpler method of removing iron-mould succeeds well, 
provided it is recent and not very dark : Tie up a teaspoonful 
of cream-tartar in the moulded place, put it into cold water 
without soap and boil it half an hour. Fruit stains may be re- 
moved in a similar way. 

TO TAKE OUT INK. 

Spread the cloth immediately over a pitcher or basin and 
let another person turn boiling water on the spots. Do not 
put the article into the water, as the whole would then be 



98 DUTCH (reformed) 



tinged with the ink. If the spots are still visible, tie up a 
teaspoonfnl of cream tartar in the places, and proceed as for 
iron-monld. If not convenient to use boiling water at once, 
put the stains in cold water — do not let them become dry. 
Soap will tend to make ink or fruit stains permanent. 

TO CLEANSE OIL CLOTHS. 

Wash with soft flannel and luke-warm water ; wipe per- 
fectly dry. Then wring a clean cloth out of skimmed milk 
and wipe the oil cloth over, moving the cloth straight across, 
not in circles or waves, and finish with a clean dry cloth. In 
this way you can keep the oil cloth fresh and bright, and it 
will last much longer than if scrubbed with soap and brush. 

W. 

TO CLEANSE BLACK SILK. 

The silk must be thoroughly brushed and wiped with a 
cloth, then laid smoothly on a board or table and well sponged 
with hot coffee that has been strained through muslin. The 
silk must be sponged on the side intended to be shown, 
allowed to become partially dry and then ironed on the wrong 
side. Miss A. E. Slingerland. 

BORAX SOAP. 

Put together one pound of bar soap cut into small pieces, 
one ounce of powdered borax, and one quart of hot water. 
Mix this over the fire but do not let it boil. When it is cold, 
cut into cakes and use like common hard soap. This soap is 
very eifectual in cleaning soiled clothes. W. 

TO RAISE THE PILE OF VELVET. 
Cover a hot smoothing iron with a wet cloth and hold the 
velvet firmly over it. The vapor arising will restore the pile 
of velvet, with the aid of a little shaking. Miss A. E. S. 

TO CRYSTALLIZE FLOWERS. 
A quarter pound of alum to one pint of boiling water. 
Put in an earthen vessel, dip the flowers singly into the hot 
liquid, and hang up to dry. Miss E. Dullegab.

RHEUMATIC LINIMENT. 
Two ounces of alcohol; two of spirits turpentine; one of 
oil of hemlock; one of chloroform; half an ounce of gum cam- 
phor. Apply two or three times a day, rubbing in well. To 
be used only externally. Miss E. Dokemus.

Needleavork should be ironed upon clean flannel, and be 
long enough under the iron to dry it, as it will look badly if 
laid away damp. Iron it on the wrong side. L. A. W. 

There is a great difference in the quality of starch. It is 
labor lost to use a poor grade. There is so much difference 
in the quantity of gluten in this article that no precise meas- 
ure for use can be given. A little experience will decide. 

Flour and meal of all kinds should be kept in a cool dry 
place. 

The best rice is large, and has a clean fresh look. Old rice 
often has little black insects inside the kernels. 

The small white sago called pearl-sago is the best. The 
large brown variety has an earthy taste. 

Keep coffee by itself, as its odor affects other articles. Keep 
tea in a close chest or canister. Bread and cake should be 
kept in a stone jar or tin box. 

Bar soap should be cut into pieces of convenient size, and 
laid away in a dry, airy place. 

Cranberries will keep all winter in a fii'kin of water in 
the cellar, if the water be renewed occasionally. Lemons may 
be kept in the same way.

For bee or wasp stings wet some cut tobacco and lay it on 
the sting. In five minutes it will be cured. Always keep cut 
tobacco in the house for such emergencies. It is invaluable 
and sure. 

Most people dry their umbrellas handle upwards. This 
concentrates the moisture at the tip, rusts the wire and rots 
the cloth. After the umbrella is drained, it is better to in- 
vert it and dry in that position. 

In testing flour, place a little in the palm of the hand and 
rub gently with the finger; if the flour smooths down, feeling 
slippery, it is inferior, and will never make good bread; if it 
rubs rough in the palm, feeling like fine sand, and has an 
orange hue, you may be confident it will not disappoint you. 

To prevent discoloration from bruises, apply a cloth wrung 
out of very hot water, renewing it frequently until the pain 
ceases. Miss M. F. V. 

A FREQUENT application of lime-water is an excellent 
remedy for burns and also for ivy poison. 

Sugar burned while cabbage is cooking will kill the odor

'NO SENTIMENT IN BUSINESS! 



Q\0? "Well, now, we think differently, and we are quite 
^^ sure that we express the views of all honorable people,, 
that Business without Sentiment is desperate, heathenish, 
and in the long run can only issue in Ruin and Shame. 

There is the Sentiment of Honor, for instance. Even 
thieves have this Sentiment, as the phrase goes : " Honor 
among thieves." And yet there are furniture and carpet 
houses, right here in Paterson, that will have nothing to do 
with Sentiment. 

There is the Sentiment of Commercial Courtesy, the 
Sentiment of Local Pride, the Sentiment of Confidence, 
all of which most business men count upon for success. 

We offer our stock of Furniture, Carpets, Oil Cloths, 
Bedding, Etc., at fair prices for good goods, and invite all 
to come and see us before buying. 
We deliver all goods free of charge,
