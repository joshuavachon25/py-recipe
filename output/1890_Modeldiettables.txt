FOODS. 

Foods may be defined as substances which, when taken into the body, aid 
in building up or repairing tissues, or, by being oxydized or burned, gener- 
ate force or energy. 

In the growing child a considerable portion of the food is converted into 
bone, muscle and brain. In the person convalescing from an acute wasting 
disease, such as typhoid fever, it is plain to see that the increased consump- 
tion of food leads to the repair of the tissues which have been reduced by 
the disease. In all, food is necessary in order to maintain the temperature 
of the body, and to enable us to put forth either physical or mental effort. 

Our ordinary foods consist of certain food-stuffs or alimentary principles, 
together with a greater or less amount of wholly indigestible substances. 
Thus, oatmeal is a food containing the food-stuffs, gluten, starch and fat, 
with a certain amount of cellulose (cell structure) which is excreted 
unchanged. The nutritive value of a food depends upon the kind and 
amount of these food-stuffs which it contains. Since no satisfactory discus- 
sion of foods can be carried on until we become acquainted with those 
constituents upon which their values depend, we will briefly consider the 
food-stuffs. Fortunately these are not numerous, and may be divided into 
the following classes : 

(1) Albumens or proteids. 

(2) Fats or oils. 

(3) Starches or carbohydrates. 

(4) Inorganic salts. 

(5) Water. 



MODEL DIET TABLES. 177 

Albumens or Proteids. 

To this group belong some of the most important food-stuffs. They all 
contain nitrogen, and for this reason foods rich in these constituents are 
called "nitrogenous foods." The chief proteids are ordinary albumen, as 
the white of egg, casein of milk, fibrin of meat, gluten of grains, flour and 
meal, and legumen of peas and beans. The amount of proteids in the vari- 
ous foods is variable, as will be seen further on. 

When we know that the blood, muscles and all the vital organs contain 
proteids as their chief constituents, we can understand the importance of 
taking food rich in one or more members of this group. The average work- 
ingman requires in his daily food not less than four ounces of pure proteid. 
The digestive and assimilative organs have the power of converting one pro- 
teid into another, but they are not able to form a proteid out of fat or 
starch. For this reason no other food-stuffs can, without injury, be a sub- 
stitute for the proteids in our food for any length of time. 

Fats. 

Fats, when oxidized or burned in the body, produce more force than will 
arise from the combustion of an equal weight of any other food-stuff. In 
cold countries the inhabitants instinctively consume large amounts of fat 
on account of the heat which is generated from it. The workingman 
requires not less than two ounces of fat per day. Fat is best digested when 
taken in a finely divided form and with some other food. 

Starches or Carbohydrates. 

To this group belong a number of substances of similar chemical compo- 
sition, and most of them are found most abundantly in vegetable foods. 
The most important are starch, sugar, gum and dextrine. Like the fats, 
they are consumed in giving energy to the body, though a much larger 
amount of the carbohydrates is required to yield the same result. The daily 
need of this food-stuff to the average workingman is between 17 and 18 
ounces. The cellulose or cell structure of plants is closely allied to the 
members of this group, and any cellulose that is absorbed must first be con- 
verted into sugar. 

Mineral Salts. 

The bones of the adult man contain as much as 70 per cent of mineral 
matter, the greater part of which is'phosphate of lime. Smaller quantities 
of the phosphate of magnesium and the carbonate of lime also exist in bones. 
The muscles, blood and other tissues contain salts of potash, soda and some 
iron. One of the most important mineral foods is common salt or the 
chloride of sodium. 

Water. 

About 70 per cent of the adult body is water. It forms the greater part 
of the blood, in which it serves as the carrier of other substances, some in 
solution, others held in suspension. Besides the fluids, the solid tissues 
contain a greater or less proportion of water ; the muscles contain as much 



178

as 75 per cent. There is also a constant loss of water by evaporation from 
the skin, by exhalation from the lungs, and by excretion from the kidneys 
and bowels. This loss must be made good by the drinking of water, and by 
taking foods more or less rich in this constituent.

180 STATE BOARD OF HEALTH.— REPORT OF SECRETARY, 1889. 

In order for a food to be of value it must not only contain food-stuffs, 
but these must be presented in a digestible form. The appearance, odor 
and taste of a food influence the digestion by stimulating or retarding, as 
the case may be, the flow of the digestive juices. We all know that a good 
piece of meat is often rendered worthless by improper cooking. 

Volume of Food. 

It is also desirable that the volume of the food taken should be large 
enough to satisfy the appetite, and still not so great as to prove burden- 
some. For this reason foods poor in certain food-stuffs are usually taken 
with some other food rich in these constituents. Thus, the potato, which 
contains not more than two per cent of proteids, is usually eaten with meat, 
which contains from fourteen to twenty-one per cent of proteids; or we 
may say with equal propriety that because the meat contains no starch, man 
has learned to take with it the potato whose chief constituent is starch. If 
one should attempt to live upon potatoes only, the weight of the food that 
be would have to take each day in order to get the minimum quantity of 
proteid upon which life could be sustained would not be less than ten or 
twelve pounds. Dr. Edward Smith actually found some of the poorest 
Irish laborers confined almost exclusively to potatoes and consuming the 
amount given above. This would lead to distension of the digestive organs 
and render one dull and stupid. The digestive organs of plant eating 
animals form from fifteen to twenty per cent of the entire body weight. In 
flesh eating animals these organs form only from five to six per cent of the 
body weight. In man the proportion is from seven to eight per cent. Thus, 
man, upon this point at least, holds an intermediate position between flesh 
eating and plant eating animals, being more closely allied to the former 
than to the latter. However, as the proper cooking of the food aids diges- 
tion, man may digest some of the vegetable foods even more quickly and 
completely than the ox can. But his food should not consist wholly of 
vegetable products. 

Cost of Food. 

In the following table, the amounts given refer to the raw food. The 
prices are average retail figures, and when food is bought in quantity the 
cost of the daily ration will be much reduced. Any variation in price from 
the figures given should be noted and a corresponding correction made in 
the footing. Tables similar to these were prepared by the writer three 
years ago,* and have been extensively followed in prisons, work-houses, 
asylums, boarding houses and private families with satisfactory results. It 
will be seen that in each table the various food-stuffs are provided for in 
proper proportions. Diet tables in which this is not done are never either 
economical or healthy. The amounts given are those required by a healthy, 
working adult. To the cost of the raw food, as given in the tables, is to be 
added the cost of cooking, fuel, keeping the table, and of furnishing season- 
ing, such as salt, pepper and mustard. Where six or more persons eat 
together, the cost of the above items, including enough to pay the wages of 
the cook and waiters, is from 35 to 50 cents per week for each boarder. 
This increases the daily cost of board by from five to seven cents above the 
figures given in the tables.

The small amount of nutritive matter in tea and coffee is not considered. 
According to the investigations of Mr. Fellows, 224 five-ounce cups of tea 
beverage are made from one pound of tea, and 45 eight-ounce cups from a 
pound of coffee. This makes the cost of an ordinary cup of tea, when the 
leaf sells at 75 cents per pound, about one-third of a cent ; and of a cup of 
coffee, when the berry sells at from 27 to 30 cents per pound, about two- 
thirds of a cent.
