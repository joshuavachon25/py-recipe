PREFACE 

'T^O MANY persons a new cook book may seem an ill-advised 
and altogether unnecessary work; but when we consider the 
leaps and bounds by which domestic science has in the last few 
years progressed, and the eagerness with which the modern woman 
strives to learn the newer and better ways of doing things, there 
seems to be ample need for a work that is at once comprehensive 
and up-to-date. 

The author has endeavored to make the recipes as economical 
as possible and has suggested a few ways in which the expense of 
foods and their preparation may be reduced. She has desired 
above all things to simplify the work of the kitchen and to reduce 
the present high cost of living. 

The recipes are planned for a family of four, because four 

seems to be the average number today. They can readily be 

divided by two for a family of two, multiplied by one and a half 

for a family of six, multiplied by three-fourths for a family of 

three, etc. Some things, like cakes, for instance, will serve more 

than four; but they will keep for several days, and are better 

made on the original scale.

PREFACE 

It is the earnest wish of the author that this book may 
lighten the labors of many women and carry to them suggestions 
of variety and economy. Housekeeping should be a delight 
instead of drudgery, and perhaps it is for the women of America, 
with their ingenuity and eagerness to try new ways of doing 
things, to show the world that woman's work in this, her special 
field, is neither menial nor stupid.

THE FINE ART OF COOKERY 



THE FINE ART OF COOKERY 

FROM the time fire was first brought to serve the needs of man, 
whether it was Prometheus or some less poetic mortal who ac- 
complished that great feat, it is probable that more or less cooking 
has been done. The art of cookery, however, is a late development, 
consequent on culture and the increase of wealth. Our early an- 
cestors ate and drank a great deal, it is true; but the meal was first 
and last a process of feeding, with little or no attempt to please the 
eye or appeal to the subtler refinements of the palate. All eating 
was done with the fingers, and food was served in straightforward 
fashion, often in such abundance and crudity as would take the ap- 
petite of a healthy man today. Cookery, then, as we know it, is 
the result of civilization. It is inextricably bound up, of course, 
with the necessities of nutrition, but mere hunger of itself will not 
produce cookery. Like modern painting and literature, it is 
largely a heritage from the Renaissance, which in the fifteenth 
and sixteenth centuries spread over Europe from Italy as center, 
carrying light and beauty in its train. 

Yet the cooking itself has always been looked upon as a despised 
work. The contempt of Lynette for Gareth, "but a kitchen- 
knave," is typical of an attitude that has lasted well into the pres- 
ent day. In late years, happily, with the rise of science in all its 
varied branches, a new interest in the subject has been awakened, 
and women of education and attainments have become more gen- 
erally concerned with what is going on within their kitchens. We 
remember with amusement the time when writing was regarded as 
menial, when kings would not wield a pen, and were dependent for 
whatever writing was needed upon the work of hired scribes. Who 
knows but that cooking may also some day be honored equally by 
all?

THE FINE ART OF COOKERY 



However that may be, it is at least essential that every house- 
wife should know something of the scientific principles of nutri- 
tion and should endeavor to have the meals served in her house- 
hold both wholesome and attractive. " Nothing," says Dr. Harvey 
W. Wiley, for many years chief chemist of the United States De- 
partment of Agriculture, "is more important in the evolution of 
the race than dietetics. The study of buying for the table and the 
proper preparation of what is bought, is as much an art as the writ- 
ing of a good book or the composition of a fine piece of poetry.'* 

Food and Its Uses. — In many ways the body is like a machine, 
with food as its source of motive energy. In the furnace fuel is 
burned quickly, in the body, slowly; but the final results are the 
same. The body differs from the machine, however, in that the 
food or fuel assists in building up as well as in supplying energy. 
Further, if more fuel is taken into the body than is necessary, it 
can be stored as reserve material, usually in the form of fat. 

Foods are classified according to their uses in the following man- 
ner: 

Protein— /oTT^s tissue; yields energy. 
\ White of egg 
, Curd of milk 

Lean meat 

Gluten of grain 

Old peas, beans, lentils 
Fats — stored as fat; yield energy. 

Fat of meat 

Butter 

Olive oil 

Oils of nuts and grains 
Carbohydrates — transformed into fat; yield energy. 

Starch 

Sugar 
Mineral. Matters — form hone; assist in digestion. 

Phosphates of lime, potash, soda, etc. 
4 



THE FINE ART OF COOKERY 



In general it may be said that the different nutrients can to a 
greater or less extent do one another's work, one being burned as 
fuel in place of another; but while protein can be burned in the 
place of fats and carbohydrates, neither of these can do the work 
of the protein in building or repairing tissue. Care should there- 
fore be taken to preserve the proper balance of foods in every daily 
menu. The wise housekeeper will not plan a meal in which all 
starchy or all fatty foods predominate, and she will see to it that 
protein in some form is provided. The protein she will find in 
cheese, meat, eggs, fish, dried legumes, etc., using one or another 
at practically every meal, and being guided in her choice by the 
market value at different seasons and by the tastes of her family. 
If she uses the various foodstuffs with reference to their nutritive 
value and is skilful in preparing them in appetizing ways, the daily 
menu may be both adequate and pleasing. 

Economy. — ^And, in order that the food be pleasing, it is not 
necessary that it be expensive. The maxim that "the best is 
always the cheapest" does not apply to food. The larger part of 
the price of costlier foods is paid for appearance, flavor or scarcity, 
and while people who can afford them may be justified in buying, 
it is well to remember that the cheaper foods frequently contain as 
much if not more nutriment and with a little care can be made just 
as pleasing. It is the lazy and unskilled cook who pays exorbitant 
prices for food rather than take the trouble to make the common 
foodstuffs appeal to the palate. 

The remedy for the foolish waste of money in buying costly 
foods "will be found," writes Dr. Atwater in a Government Bulle- 
tin, "in a better knowledge of cooking and serving food, and in the 
acceptance of the doctrine that economy is not only respectable 
but honorable." The German housewife's "thrift" may seem a 
trifle sordid at times; but the study of the relative costs of foods 
should not be beneath the dignity of any woman. Housekeeping 
is becoming more and more a matter of science, and the laurels 
are bound to fall to the woman who conducts her household in a 
business-like way. No man, no matter how wealthy he may be, 

5 



THE FINE ART OF COOKERY 



permits needless waste of money in the management of his busi- 
ness; no woman should permit waste in the management of the 
household, which is her business. 

"It is common enough," writes Ida M. Tarbell, "to hear women 
arguing that this close grappling with household economy is nar- 
rowing, not worthy of them. Why keeping track of the cost of 
eggs and butter and calculating how much your income will allow 
you is any more narrowing than keeping track of the cost and 
quality of cotton or wool or iron and calculating how much a mill 
requires, it is hard to see. It is the same kind of problem. More- 
over, it has the added interest of being always an independent 
personal problem. Most men work under the deadening effect of 
impersonal routine. They do that which others have planned and 
for results in which they have no share." 

One point is worth mentioning here, and that is that "ready-to- 
eat '* foods, except perhaps in the case of cereals,where the saving 
of fuel is worth considering, are expensive and not always so good 
as the old-fashioned dishes prepared in the old-fashioned way. 
The cook who is exceedingly pressed for time or the housewife who 
does her own cooking may be justified in using instantaneous, 
ready-flavored gelatine, for instance; but the result is seldom so 
good as gelatine prepared by the old method, and the cost is de- 
cidedly greater. Even in the matter of baking powder the house- 
wife may, by making the mixture herself, reduce the cost to ex- 
actly one-fourth of its present market price. 

Economy in fuel is another consideration of first-rate import- 
ance, especially where gas is used. The fireless and steam cookers 
have made possible no inconsiderable saving of fuel, and one, if not 
both, should be a part of the furnishing of every up-to-date kitchen. 
Important as these are, however, the wise planning of meals is still 
more important. It is no economy to buy a cheap cut of meat if 
that cut will require long cooking on a gas stove or in a gas oven; 
better buy one less cheap that can be cooked in a short time — ^for 
gas is expensive. Care must also be taken not to use the oven 
needlessly and to make the most of its heat. If meat is roasting, 

6 



THE FINE ART OF COOKERY 



plan to bake potatoes at the same time; and do not light the oven 
just to bake potatoes or some vegetable that will cook equally well 
on the top of the stove — say in a steamer. 

These are minor matters, of course, but they all play their part, 
and in many families call for greater attention than they receive. 
The importance of economy should be known by every housewife 
and should be explained to every servant. 

Cleanliness. — One other thing — still more important than 
economy — that must be impressed upon every servant is the neces- 
sity of cleanliness. And care with regard to the food is not of it- 
self suflScient: the kitchen and her own person are almost equally 
important. It is unfortunate that in so many households the cook 
is consigned to the meanest and darkest room in the house and 
denied the use of a bathroom. It is likewise unfortunate that she 
in most cases does not know the value of clean hands, clean floors, 
clean refrigerators, clean pots and pans, etc. 

"Scrupulous cleanliness,'* says the Bulletin previously quoted, 
"should always be observed in keeping, handling and serving food. 
If ever cleanliness is desirable, it must be in the things we eat, and 
every care should be taken to insure it for the sake of health as well 
as decency. Cleanliness in this connection means not only ab- 
sence of visible dirt, but freedom from undesirable bacteria and 
other minute organisms, and from worms and other parasites. If 
food, raw or cooked, is kept in dirty places, peddled from dirty 
carts, prepared in dirty rooms and in dirtj^ dishes, or exposed to 
foul air, disease germs and other offensive and dangerous sub- 
stances can easily get in." 

Purposes of Cooking. — Cooking, of course, destroys many such 
germs, and that is one reason why cooked foods are better and 
more wholesome than uncooked. Cooking has other important 
purposes too; for it renders food more capable of mastication and 
consequently of digestion. It does this both by changing its actual 
structure and by making it more appetizing, thus stimulating the 
flow of the saliva and the gastric juices. The importance of good 
cooking cannot be overestimated. 

7 



THE FINE ART OF COOKERY 



x\nd while, as we have seen, the careful cooking and serving of 
food are themselves the result of a developed esthetic sense, they 
are at the same time a means of further development. A good 
meal, well cooked, and daintily served, has a certain subtle moral 
effect not to be disregarded^in this age of nervous haste and flaunt- 
ing materialism. If we are "but what we eat," we are also in a 
very real sense the product of all the influences that play about us 
as we eat. The child, contented over his morning bowl of oatmeal, 
is not unmindful of the cleanliness and order of the table at which 
he sits, and the scent of the orange or the cocoa may be just as re- 
fining in its influence as the fragrance^of the honey-suckle wafted 
through the open window. If beautiful surroundings have, as we 
now generally agree, their effect upon the sensitive, impressionable 
nature of the child, the meal to which he comes gladly three times 
a day must play a tremendous part in determining what his future 
character will be. 

Nor is it only the child who is influenced. A poor meal, served 
in slovenly fashion, will upset many a healthy man's temper for 
the day. After all, one's philosophy is largely a matter of what one 
has had for breakfast. 



ENTERTAINING 



So saying f with dispatchful looks in haste. 
She turns, on hospitable thoughts intent — 
What choice to choose for delicacy best. 
What order so contrived as not to mix 
Tastes not well joined, inelegant; hut bring 
Taste after taste upheld with kindliest change, 

— ^Milton: Paradise Lost. 



ENTERTAINING 

A CERTAIN amount of entertaining is necessary, even if one 
goes to the extent of believing with Byron that society is 
only a polished horde, 

Formed of two mighty tribes, the bores and bored; 

and to the hostess who does not try to entertain beyond her 
means or her strength, the bringing together of friends should 
be a pleasure. Too frequently the pleasure is greater on the 
part of guest than of hostess. 

Is this because in the rush of our modern life we have lost 
sight of the beauty of hospitality, which from very earliest times 
has been a sacred thing? We recall pictures of Oriental hospi- 
tality, familiar through the pages of the Bible, so striking and 
beautiful that we have unconsciously made them the standard 
by which the relations of host and guest are to be judged for all 
time. The story of the woman of Shunem who constrained the 
prophet Elisha to eat bread "as oft as he passed by" is enshrined 
in the heart of every true woman. 

Naturally to us the present-day oriental customs seem lavish 
and absurdly formal; they have, perhaps, lost the spirit of that 
olden time in which the bond between host and guest was scarcely 
less holy than that between father and son; at any rate, they do 
not fall in with our occidental ideas of democracy and frankness. 
We can cultivate the fine flower of hospitality without a multi- 
tude of senseless wrappings. The naked flower is all we want; 
we have all know^n the misery of being "made company of." 

Ceremony, fortunately, is becoming more and more a thing of 
the past — not because people are less kind, but because the com- 
plexity of modern life makes simplicity in social relations a relief 

11 



ENTERTAINING 



if not a necessity. A few illustrations will show the difference: 
It is no longer considered necessary for the guests to say that 
they have had a good time when taking leave of a hostess after 
a dinner-party or other entertainment; it is no longer customary 
for the hostess to accompany her lady callers to the front door; 
it is no longer even proper to say "Sir" or "Madam," except, 
perhaps, in addressing a stranger in a public place. 

Elaborate entertainments and a certain degree of formality 
may be necessary occasionally; but one can invite one's friends 
and have pleasant times without a great deal of preparation and 
expense. Hospitality is the prime necessity, and even a twelve- 
course dinner is unpalatable, lacking that golden sauce. 

THE DINNER PARTY 

The dinner takes first rank among entertainments and usually 
involves more or less formality. Invitations are sent out at least 
two weeks in advance of the entertainment and should be an- 
swered immediately. The formal invitation is engraved; the 
guest's name, hour and date written in by hand.

For a less formal entertainment a note in the first person may 
be sent:

evening, January the eighteenth, at eight o'clock ?

ENTERTAINING 



The dinner in this case may be quite as formal as that for which 
the third-person invitation was sent, and evening dress is required. 

For a very informal little dinner an unconventional note is sent 
a week or less before the date set; and dinner dress is not required. 

For the formal dinner, guests are expected to arrive at the hour 
appointed and courtesy does not demand that the hostess wait 
more than fifteen minutes for a tardy guest. At large dinners 
each gentleman finds on a tray in the dressing-room a small 
addressed envelope containing a card on which is written the 
name of the lady whom he is to escort to dinner and "R" or "L" 
in one corner to indicate on which side of the table they are to 
sit. If he does not know the lady, the hostess should see that he 
is presented to her. 

Introductions 

The hostess stands near the door and receives the guests, making 
such introductions as are convenient. In general, the *'roof 
introduction" is considered sufiicient — especially at large dinners. 
Introductions, however, should be given wherever possible, for 
they make intercourse among one's guests easier. Where one 
knows to whom one is speaking one can sometimes more readily 
find subjects of interest. 

On the other hand, it is not considered good form for a hostess 
to interrupt a conversation between guests for the purpose of 
making an introduction, or to introduce a guest upon his entrance 
to more than one other at a time. 

In making an introduction the gentleman is always presented 
to the lady, and the names should be pronounced as distinctly as 
possible: nothing is more discourteous to one's guests than a mut- 
tered introduction. The ordinary form is: "Mrs. Brown, allow 
me to present Mr. Smith." In the same way a young woman is 
presented to an older one, an unmarried woman to a matron, a 
young man to an older one, though these rules are sometimes 
modified in deference to age or station. For instance, a young, 
unmarried woman would be presented to a very old gentleman or 
to a dignitary of Church or State. 

In introducing two women the form mentioned in the preceding 
paragraph is used, or simply "Mrs. Brown, this is Mrs. Smith." 
The latter form is preferable where there is doubt as to which is 
entitled to the presentation. 

The tactful hostess usually adds to any introduction some 
remark which will enable the guests to converse more readily. 

a 13 



ENTERTAINING 



She may say, for instance, "Mrs. Brown, allow me to present 
Mrs. Smith, who has just returned from London"; or," Mrs. Smith, 
this is Mrs. Brown: two such ardent bridge players should know 
each other." There are very few persons who will not be grate- 
ful for some such hint. 

Seating the Guests 

The servant watches the number of guests and when all have 
arrived announces dinner. Or, in case of a belated guest, he 
waits for a signal from the hostess. When dinner is announced, 
the host offers his right arm to the lady who is to sit at his right. 
The other couples follow; then, last, the hostess with the gentle- 
man who is to sit at her right. 

Guests are enabled to find their places easily by means of "place 
cards," on which the name of each guest is distinctly written. 
Confusion in seating the guests is thus avoided, and it can be 
arranged to have congenial persons near each other. 

The host and hostess may sit at the ends of the table or in the 
middle of each side. The lady who is to be especially honored 
sits on the host's right, she who is to be honored next, on his left. 
Similarly two gentlemen are honored by seats on the right and left 
of the hostess. 

The hostess should, as far as possible, bring together only guests 
who "mix well," and should select the dinner partners tactfully. 
Two very quiet people should not be seated together, or two 
who have very decided opinions, or two who are known to be 
uncongenial. The dinner should be a feast of good things other 
than food, and conversation should be as entertaining as possible. 
Upon host and hostess, of course, devoKes the duty of keeping 
conversation alive, though the guests are expected to do their 
part. Many a hostess has saved the day by a bon mot or a tactful 
change of subject. Some women are horn hostesses : most women 
can be made, or, rather, can make themselves successful host- 
esses. The chief essentials are tact, which is the saving grace of all 
women, the ability to be interested in many things, and true 
kindliness. 

Courtesy, after all — that is, true courtesy — is a matter of the 
heart, and is not dependent upon any knowledge of social usages. 
Some women, notably poor conversationalists, are still very 
charming hostesses. In them thoughtfulness and tact make up 
for lack of brilliancy. 

One thing, however, is of first importance for the hostess' 

14 



ENTERTAINING 



peace of mind. All the arrangements for the entertainment must 
be carefully planned, so that the dinner will proceed with the 
smoothness of clock-work and that the hostess may be as a guest 
at her own table. Servants should be thoroughly instructed 
beforehand, and everything should be in readiness when the guests 
arrive. 

Menu and Table 

In arranging the menu too much should not be attempted and 
each course should be in pleasing contrast to the last. Except for 
a very elaborate dinner, raw oysters, a clear soup, fish, one entree, 
a roast with potatoes and one other vegetable, salad with cheese 
straws or crackers and cheese, an ice, fruit and black coffee should 
be sufficient. Butter is never served except at the informal 
family dinner. 

The table should have its centerpiece of growing ferns or flowers, 
and two or four candlesticks with wax candles and pretty shades. 
(No edibles, with the exception of bonbons, salted nuts or crystal- 
lized fruits in compotiers, appear upon the table.) All the china 
used in the same course should match wherever possible; but a 
different set of plates are permissible for each course. 

A supply of extra silver should be laid out in convenient fashion 
on the sideboard, and finger-bowls, dessert plates, after-dinner 
coffee cups and spoons should be in readiness on the side-table. 
Water in the finger-bowls should be warm, with perhaps a dainty 
flower or a leaf of rose geranium floating on the surface. 

SKELETON MENU FOR FULL COURSE DINNER 

Shellfish — on ice with lemon — light oyster crackers. 

Clear Soup — in soup plates, half full — thick slices of bread or roll folded in the 

napkin. 
HoRS d'oeuvres — olives, celery, radishes, etc. — passed after soup is served. 
Fish — with appropriate sauce, potato balls and cucumbers if possible. 
Entree — patties, timbale of chicken, or creamed dishes in paper cases (bread 

passed). 
Meat — with appropriate sauce, jelly, potatoes, one vegetable and fruit punch. 
Game — small birds, whole; others, in halves or slices — varying accompaniments. 
Salad — served with the game — Brie, Roquefort or cream cheese and crackers. 
Hot Pudding — with wine sauce. 

Glace — ice, ice cream or frozen dessert — with sweet wafers. 
Dessert — nuts, fruits, bonbons, crackers, cheese. 
Coffee — black, served with sugar alone.

HINTS ON SERVING 

1. Food should always be set down before guests from the right. 

2. When a dish is presented from which a guest is to help him- 
self, it should be passed to the left. 

3. When a course is finished, the plate should be removed from 
the left. 

4. Plates should be before the guests when they take seats at 
the table and when one plate is removed it should be immediately 
replaced by another. 

5. At the right of the plate have oyster fork, soup spoon and 
knives in the order of use, the one first needed farthest from the 
plate. On the left lay the forks in the order of use, the one first 
needed farthest from the plate. Let the bowls of the spoons and 
the tines of the forks be turned upward and the cutting edges of 
the knives toward the plate. Place the napkin upon the plate 
or at the left of the forks, with a small thick piece of bread or 
dinner roll inserted between the folds. The napkin should be 
simply folded, either standing upright in a sort of triangular 
form or lying flat with the top part creased and turned back 
diagonally and the bread tucked under the fold. 

6. If wine-glasses are to be used set the glass for water above 
the plate near the center of the cover and the wine-glasses to the 
right in a half circle, the one to be used first nearest the hand. 

7. Before the dessert is served all the plates, small silver, salt 

16 



ENTERTAINING 



and pepper shakers, and all glasses that will not be used again 
should be removed. Then the table should be ** crumbed," using 
a silver crumb knife and a plate. 

8. Spoons or knives and forks for the sweet course are usually 
supplied after the table is cleared. Spoons or knives are laid to 
the right of the plate; forks to the left. If forks only are called 
for they are placed at the right. 

9. Black coffee in small cups (followed by cordials if used) is 
the last course, and should precede the finger-bowls unless the 
coffee is to be served to the ladies in the drawing-room. In that 
case the finger-bowls should be placed before the ladies leave the 
table. 

10. Wine should be poured into the glasses from the right and 
should follow the serving of each course. It is common now to 
have but three kinds: sherry, claret and champagne, and some- 
times only one. Sherry is served with the soup; champagne and 
claret with the following courses. 

Where there is only one pair of hands to do both cooking and 
serving still less formality should be observed. The service plate 
should be omitted; all the knives and forks to be used should 
be upon the table, with salts and peppers at the corners of the table, 
or one for every two persons. Bread-and-butter plates, contain- 
ing butter-ball, and a small butter knife should be placed at the 
left of the cover before dinner is announced, and a dinner roll 
folded into the napkin. Glasses should be filled with ice- water 
and everything needed should be on the side table before the guests 
are seated. The plates for each course served on the table should 
be placed in a low pile, not more .than three or four at a time, in 
front of the host or hostess. As each is filled the maid will lift 
it to her tray, carry and place it before the guest. 

INVITATIONS IN GENERAL 

Invitations to luncheon are similar to those used for dinner, 
although, as the entertainment is generally less formal, the 
engraved invitation is much less frequent. 

Invitations for afternoon or evening entertainments vary 
according to the number of guests and the degree of formality 
desired. For small, informal affairs the hostess simply uses her 
visiting card (or one engraved a trifle larger), writing in the lower 
left-hand corner "Cards," "Musicale," or whatever the enter- 
tainment is to be, and under it the date and hour. She may write 

17 



ENTERTAINING 



under her own name **To meet Miss Mary Jones" if the enter- 
tainment is given in honor of Miss Jones. 

For informal entertainments, however, the cordial little note 
of invitation is preferred by many, perhaps because it seems a 
more direct and personal appeal. It is a subtle compliment, 
sometimes, well calculated to make a diffident invited guest feel 
that she is really wanted. 

THE INFORMAL DINNER 

The informal dinner, to which only a few guests are invited, is 
served almost like the formal dinner; but where there is only one 
waitress it is customary to do a good deal of the serving on the 
table. 

For this simple dinner, soup, a roast, two vegetables, a salad, 
dessert and coffee amply suffice. 

Soup may be served by the hostess from a tureen. The 
waitress takes one soup-plate at a time from the sideboard, placing 
it in front of the hostess; when it is filled she passes it to the guest 
and brings another. Fish may be served by the host and passed 
in the same manner as the soup. The roast is carved by the host; 
but entrees, if included in the menu, are served from the side. 
Vegetables and sauces should be placed on the side-table and 
passed to each guest when required. The salad may be brought 
in on individual plates or served on the table by either host or 
hostess. The dessert is served by the hostess, and the coffee, unless 
brought in cups from the kitchen, is poured by her. Bonbons 
and relishes are usually on the table. 

AFTERNOON TEA 

The serving of afternoon tea with its dainty accompaniment of 
sandwiches or cake is coming into ever greater popularity, whether 
at an entertainment to which cards for "Afternoon tea at four 
o'clock'* are sent or during the customary afternoon calls. In 
the former case, naturally, the refreshments are usually more 
elaborate, though in no case should they be hea\'y, as dinner is 
so close at hand. 

For the small reunion of friends the tea should be made and 
served by the hostess in the drawing-room or living-room or in 
summer weather out of doors. Simple sandwiches and cakes are 
served with hot tea, coffee or chocolate, though tea is preferable, 

18 



ENTERTAINING 



because less rich and held by most women in high esteem. As 
Edmund Waller puts it : 

Tea does our fancy aid 

Repress those vapors which the head invade. 

And keeps that palace of the soul serene. 

In hot weather, however, iced coffee, tea or punch is usually 
more acceptable. No service or assistance is necessary except 
to bring in the required articles; the hostess or a friend makes the 
tea and the guests help each other and themselves. 

For the more pretentious afternoon tea, refreshments are served 
in the dining-room, from a table made beautiful with flowers, 
lights and tempting viands. At one end of the table is usually a 
tea-service and at the other a service for chocolate; each is pre- 
sided over by a friend of the hostess. The refreshments include 
sandwiches, fancy cakes, olives, bonbons, etc. These are passed 
to the standing guests by waitresses or young girls, also friends 
of the hostess. Napkins are a convenience, but not a necessity; 
sandwiches and cakes are usually placed on the saucer or a plate 
under it. Frappe is sometimes served in addition to the other 
delicacies. 

THE EVENING COLLATION 

Evening refreshments may be of infinite variety — from the very 
simple to the most elaborate — without regard to appetite or 
digestion. The menu may include hot bouillon, hot entrees, 
sandwiches, cold entrees, salads, coffee, wine or punch, ices and 
cakes. Coffee may be served in teacups with the supper or in 
after-dinner cups as a last course. The second way is necessarily 
customary where guests are not seated at tables. 

Only the daintiest of china, glass and silver should appear on 
the table, and all crowding should be avoided: dishes can be 
replenished from the pantry if necessary. The table may be simply 
or elaborately decorated according to the kind of entertainment, 
the season, and the inclination of the host. Candlelight is to be 
preferred to any other, both because it is softer and because the 
candlesticks assist in making the table pretty.

IT Is customary to serve at the beginning of a meal a dish which, 
while it may have little food value, whets the appetite and 
stimulates the flow of digestive juices. At the formal dinner 
this is ordinarily raw oysters or clams in the shell, or caviar or 
anchovy canapes; but for other meals the cocktail is coming into 
ever wider use. 

The fruit cocktails are acceptable to many people, and at 
luncheons frequently form part of the decorative scheme. The 
cocktail glass should be set on a small linen or paper doily on a 
plate. 

OYSTER COCKTAIL No. I 

12 oysters 1 saltspoon salt

cold water. Set the pulp on the ice. At serving time put a tea- 
spoon of cracked ice in the bottom of each shell; fill with the pulp, 
mixed thoroughly with powdered sugar and a little sherry if de- 
sired; and place a maraschino cherry or bit of bright-colored jelly 
in the center of each. Lay on paper doilies or surround with bits 
of asparagus fern. 

MIXED FRUIT COCKTAILS 

Cut into small pieces as many different kinds of fruit as you have 
in the house; sweeten to taste and set on the ice to chill. At serv- 
ing time fill the cocktail glasses and place a maraschino cherry or

Fresh or canned pineapple is one of the most refreshing fruits 
for cocktails. 

RASPBERRY COCKTAIL

SOUPS 



/ 



SOUPS 

SOUPS are wholesome and palatable and should form part of 
even the informal home dinner whenever possible. They are 
also excellent luncheon dishes. 

It is a good plan to have some sort of vegetable or meat stock 
always at hand, as this renders the making of soup both easy and 
economical. With milk at hand, cream soups are likewise easily 
made. 

MEAT STOCK 

To make good soup some kind of meat stock is almost essential. 
Instruct the butcher to deliver all bones and trimmings removed 
from roasts ; and save all meats and gravies left over from previous 
meals. By so doing soup may be at once economical and good. 

To every pound of meat and bone use one quart of cold water. 
Cut the meat into pieces and ask the butcher to crush the large 
bones, so that the gelatine and fat may be fully extracted. Put all 
in a covered kettle on the back of the stove. When the water be- 
comes red bring the kettle forward and let it heat slowly. Keep 
the water below the boiling point for three or four hours. If more 
water is needed, add boiling water. It is not necessary to remove 
the scum that rises. 

Stock should be prepared at least one day before it is to be used, 
so that the fat on the top may harden and be removed. Do not 
remove the fat until it is necessary, however, as it aids in keeping 
the stock sweet, 

VEGETABLE STOCK 

1 carrot 1 tablespoon sugar 

1 onion 4 tablespoons oSve oil 

1 stalk celery 2 quarts cold water 

2 turnips 2 bay leaves 

2 tomatoes Salt and pepper

the olive oil and the vegetables. Add the water and season to 
taste. Let it simmer for one or two hours; strain and stand aside 
to cool. 

CREAM STOCK 

1 pint milk 1 tablespoon butter 

1 tablespoon flour 1/2 teaspoon salt 

Red or black pepper 

Melt the butter over the fire and add the flour, being careful not 
to let it brown. Add the milk gradually, stirring constantly to 
prevent lumps ; then add the seasoning.

though any lean portions will do. Cut the beef and veal into 
small pieces and brown them in the butter over a hot fire. Add 
the cold water, onion, celery, carrot and bay leaf; simmer slowly 
for five or six hours in a covered kettle. Take from the fire; cool; 
remove the fat; strain; reheat and serve.

FISH 




TURBOT CRAB SALMON 



FISH 

AS ordinarily used, the term fish includes, besides the fish 
proper, many other water animals, such as oysters, clams, 
lobsters, crawfish, crabs, shrimps, turtle and terrapin. In gen- 
eral fish contains the same kind of nutrients as other food mate- 
rials, serving the two-fold purpose of tissue-building and the pro- 
duction of heat and energy. It is not so rich in nutrients or fuel 
value as meat, but furnishes an economical source of nitrogen 
and lends to the diet that variety which is almost essential. 

There are, of course, dangers from eating fish, and though they 
are scarcely greater than dangers from other kinds of food, it 
may be well to consider some of them here. 

Fish, like meat, may contain parasites injurious to man; but 
these are destroyed by thorough cooking. 

Fish may also contain ptomaines. Their formation frequently 
accompanies putrefaction, and care should therefore be taken to 
serve fish only when it is in perfectly healthy condition. Fish 
which has been frozen and, after thawing, kept for a time before 
it is cooked, is especially likely to contain ptomaines. 

Decomposition can often be recognized by the odor of the fish 
or by the test of laying the fish in water. Those which sink 
may be considered undecomposed and wholesome; those which 
float, unfit for use. The appearance of the fish is another guide: 
if the eyes have lost their sheen or the cornea is cloudy; if the 
gills are pale red or the scales dry or easily loosened, or if the 
meat is so soft that when pressed the indentation of the finger 
remains, it should be considered unfit for food. 

Ordinarily the scales are removed and the fish drawn before it 
is delivered; but if not, this should be done at once. Then wash 
the fish thoroughly, wipe it dry, sprinkle with salt and put in a 

49 



■|77QTT Planned for a

cold place. In the refrigerator fish will taint butter and other 
foods if placed in the same compartment, so that in most cases 
it is better to lay it on a plate on a pan of ice, setting the 
pan in the cellar. Fish that are frozen should soak in cold water 
until they are thawed, but should not be allowed to remain until 
they are flexible. Salt fish should be soaked in fresh water, skin 
side up, to draw out the salt. 

CLEANING FISH 

To remove the scales hold the fish by the tail and scrape firmly 
toward the head with a small sharp knife, held with the blade 
slanting toward the tail. Scrape slowly so that the scales will not 
fly, and rinse the knife frequently in cold water. 

If the fish is to be served whole, leave the head and tail on and 
trim the fins; otherwise remove them. 

To open small fish make an incision under the gills and squeeze 
out the contents by pressing upward from the middle with the 
thumb and finger. To open large fish split them from the gills 
half way down the body toward the tail; remove the entrails 
and scrape and clean, opening far enough to remove all the blood 
from the backbone, and waping the inside thoroughly with a cloth 
wrung out of cold, salted w^ater. 

To skin a fish remove the fins along the back and cut off a narrow 
strip of the skin the entire length of the back. Then slip the knife 
under the skin that lies over the bony part of the gills and work 
slowly toward the tail. Do the same with the other side. 

To bone a fish clean it first and remove the head. Then, begin- 
ning at the tail, run a sharp knife under the flesh close to the bone, 
scraping the flesh away clean from the bone. Work up one side 
toward the head; then repeat the same process on the other side 
of the bone. Lift the bone carefully and pull out any small bones 
that may be left in the flesh. 

BOILED FISH 

Wipe the fish carefully and if fresh, sprinkle thoroughly with 
salt. Wrap it in a piece of cheesecloth to hold the fish together 
and to prevent the scum from clinging to the fish, and place it in 
a kettle of boiling water, adding a teaspoon of salt and a tablespoon 
of vinegar to every two quarts of water, also a slice of onion, a bay

leaf and a sprig of parsley. Cook slowly, following the time 
table in the front of the book ; lift and drain carefully; open the 
cloth and turn the fish upon the serving platter, garnishing with 
parsley and slices of lemon. The fish is done when the flesh is 
firm and separates easily from the bone. 

As fish used for boiling has little fat and is cooked in none, it 
needs a rich sauce to make it palatable. Drawn butter, egg, 
Hollandaise and Bechamel sauces are used. 

BAKED FISH 

' Wash and dry the fish, rubbing inside and out with salt; stuff 
with forcemeat or bread stuffing and sew. Cut gashes two inches 
apart on both sides, alternating, and into each slip a narrow strip 
of salt fat pork. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and place in a hot 
oven without water. As soon as it begins to brown add hot water 
and butter and baste every ten minutes. Bake until done, allow- 
ing an hour or more for a large fish, twenty or thirty minutes for 
a small one. Remove to a hot platter; draw out the strings; wipe 
off all water or fat and remove pork; garnish with slices of lemon 
well covered with chopped parsley and serve with Hollandaise 
sauce. 

BROILED FISH 

For broiling large fish should be split down the back and head 
and tail removed; salmon and halibut should be cut into one-inch 
slices, and smelts and other small fish left whole. Wipe the fish 
as dry as possible; sprinkle with salt and pepper and if the fish 
is dry and white brush the flesh side well with olive oil or butter. 
Put in a well-greased broiler, placing the thickest parts of the fish 
toward the middle or back of the broiler. Hold over a hot fire 
until the flesh side is nicely browned; then cook the skin side just 
long enough to make the skin crisp. Small fish require from ten 
to fifteen minutes, large fish from fifteen to twenty-five. To remove 
from the broiler loosen one side first, then the other, and lift care- 
fully with a cake turner. Place on a platter; spread with butter 
and stand in the oven for a few minutes. Garnish with lemon and 
serve with Maitre d'Hotel sauce. 

FRIED FISH 

Wash and dry the fish; season with salt and pepper; dip in fine 
bread crumbs, then in beaten eggy then in bread crumbs again. 

51 



■I7TCXT Planned for a 

r lOXl Family of Four 

Place the fish in a frying basket and fry in hot fat, preferably olive 
oil. Be sure that the fat is hot; test it by lowering a small piece 
of bread; if it browns in thirty seconds the fat is sufficiently hot. 
Put only a few pieces of fish in the basket at a time and remove 
them as soon as they are brown. Garnish with parsley and serve 
with Tartare sauce. 

SHAD ROE 

Shad roe may be baked, broiled or fried. To broil, wipe dry; 
sprinkle with pepper and salt and cook five minutes on each side. 
Butter well and stand in the oven for a few minutes; then serve 
garnished with parsley and lemon. To fry, proceed as with fish, 
but cook the roe for ten minutes first in boiling water. 

BAKED SHAD 

Clean and split a three-pound shad, placing it skin side down 
in a baking pan. Sprinkle with salt and pepper; spread with 
butter and thin slices of bacon and bake twenty-five or thirty 
minutes in a hot oven. Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon. 

PLANKED SHAD 

Clean and split a three-pound shad. Heat the plank very hot; 
lay the fish upon it, skin side down. Brush the flesh carefully 
over with olive oil or butter; then sprinkle with salt and pepper. 
Bake for thirty minutes in a hot oven. It may be cooked in a gas 
range, having the flame over the fish. When cooked pour over 
the fish two tablespoons of melted butter and the juice of one 
lemon. Garnish with parsley, quarters of lemon, and mashed 
potatoes. Shape the potatoes by means of a forcing bag and star 
tube; brush over with beaten yolk of egg; then brown in the oven. 
Set the plank on a serving dish and serve. 

PLANKED HALIBUT 

Trim the ends of a solid piece of halibut, weighing about four 
pounds and cut the entire width of the fish. Peel and slice three 
onions into a baking pan, and on these lay the halibut. Squeeze 
the juice of a small lemon over it; put some pieces of butter on the 
top; pour in half a cup of white stock and half a cup of white wine. 
Bake for three quarters of an hour; baste several times with the 
liquid in i^he pan. Add a little salt

When ready lift out the fish on to a hot plank. Put some hot 
mashed potatoes through a forcing bag round the fish, brtish 
with beaten egg, and return to a hot oven to brown the potatoes. 
Fill up the space between the fish and potatoes with hot vegetables. 
Decorate with pieces of cooked cucumber, which have the centers 
removed and filled with cooked and seasoned peas. 



BAKED FILLETS OF HALIBUT 

Cut the halibut into small fillets; season and place in a shallow 
pan, covered with buttered paper. Bake in a hot oven from ten to 
fifteen minutes. Garnish with parsley and serve with Hollan- 
daise sauce. 

FRIED SMELTS 

Clean the smelts, leaving on the heads and tails. Sprinkle well 
with salt, pepper and flour; dip in egg, then in fine bread crumbs, 
and fry in deep fat. Garnish with parsley and slices of lemon and 
serve with Tartare sauce. 

SALT-FISH DINNER 

1 pound codfish 2 tablespoons fat 
1/2 pound salt pork 2 tablespoons flour 

2 cups skim milk Speck of salt 

Dash of red pepper 

Cut the codfish in strips; soak in lukewarm water and cook 
below the boiling point until tender. Cut the pork into one-fourth 
inch slices; cut several gashes in each piece; fry slowly until 
golden brown and remove, pouring off the fat. Out of two table- 
spoons of the fat, the flour, seasoning and milk make a cream sauce. 
Put the codfish on a platter with pieces of pork around it; and serve 
with boiled potaoes and the cream sauce. 

CODFISH 

Let the fish soak in cold water for four or five hours to draw 
out the salt; wash the fish very clean; put it in a kettle with cold 
water; bring to a boil; then stand aside where it will keep just 
below boiling temperature. When perfectly tender, drain; put 
on a platter and cover with cream sauce.

tered toast. 

FRIED OYSTERS 

Select large oysters; drain them and dry between soft towels. 
Dip each oyster in beaten egg until it is thoroughly coated; then 
roll in cracker dust or fine bread crumbs well seasoned with salt 
and pepper. Lay the oysters in a wire basket, a few at a time, and 
lower them into boiling hot fat. Test the fat by lowering a piece 
of stale bread into it; if it browns in thirty seconds the fat is 
sufficiently hot; if it burns the fat is too hot. Fry the oysters a 
delicate brown; drain them over the fat; then lay on brown paper 
in the oven until serving time. 

Olive oil is best for frying, though suetine, cottolene, crisco, 
or a mixture of suet and lard brings good results. Butter alone or 
lard alone should never be used.

To kill the lobster grasp it by the back and put its head under 
hot water; then its body, and quickly cover the kettle. The 
lobster will die immediately, but should remain in the water about 
twenty minutes, boiling all the time. 

The meat should not be eaten until cold and should never be 
kept more than eighteen hours after cooking. It should not be 
removed from the shell until it is to be used. 

Remove the meat from the shell, discarding the gills, stomach 
and intestines. Garnish with small clams and lettuce leaves. 

PLANKED LOBSTER 

To plank a lobster heat the plank very hot. Kill the lobster 
by splitting it into halves, lay it on the plank shell side down; put 
it under the gas for twenty minutes; baste with butter; dust with 
salt and pepper, and cook ten minutes longer. Garnish with small 
fried French potato balls and grated cucumber in tiny lettuce 
leaves.

li WHETHER or not meat is absolutely essential to the human 
'^ V body has never been adequately worked out, but animal 
flesh has been from earliest times the staple article of diet wher- 
ever it could be found. It is true that the American Indian sub- 
sisted largely upon maize, and developed enormous strength in 
the practice, but it is likewise true that he ate meat whenever it 
was available. There is a flavor in the so-called "extractives'* of 
meat which nothing can altogether replace, no matter how firmly 
we may be convinced that other foods contain as much or more 
protein and fats. 

The cooking of meats is more important, perhaps, than the 
cooking of any other kind of food, as good cooking enhances and 
poor cooking lessens or destroys the nutritive value. In general 
it may be said that cooking develops the pleasing taste and odor 
of the meat and softens and loosens the protein of the connective 
tissues, thus making the meat more tender. Extreme heat, how- 
ever, tends to harden the albuminoids of the lean portions and 
to weaken the flavor of the extractives. 

Fresh meat should never be permitted to soak in cold water, 
as cold water draws out the juices. It should in most cases 
simply be wiped with a damp cloth, and if washed should be 
dried immediately. 

Meat is in most households the most expensive food placed 
upon the table and unfortunately not always the richest from the 
physiological standpoint. It therefore behooves the housewife to 
buy as wisely as possible and to consider some of the suggestions 
found in the following pages for cooking the cheaper cuts of meat. 

"Take the side of a steer lying in a butcher shop and consider 
it as composed of three equal parts," says Dr. Harvey W. Wiley.

"At wholesale prices one of these parts will cost the butcher 
today 6| cents per pound, another 7| cents, the other 16 cents. 
Now, there is not the slightest difference in the quality of these 
three cuts. One tastes just as good as the other and is just as 
nutritious if properly cooked. The only reason that one part 
costs more than twice as much as the other is that there is twice 
as much demand for that particular cut of beef. The average 
family uses cuts that come from 28 per cent of the steer. This 
leaves 72 per cent of so-called 'rough meat' in the carcass that 
costs only about half as much as the other 28 per cent. Yet, I 
repeat, there is no practical difference in the meat. One can be 
made just as palatable as the other, and the ordinary housewife 
can almost cut her meat bill in two and, at the same time, set 
just as good a table as usual if, instead of buying the expensive 
cuts, she gets the cheaper ones and prepares them carefully." 

Roasting 

The chief point to remember in roasting is that the meat should 
be quickly browned in order that the crust thus formed may retain 
the juices. The oven should therefore be hot when the meat is 
put in and the heat, if possible, gradually reduced. 

Wipe the meat with a damp cloth, but do not wash it. Sprinkle 
with pepper and salt and just a little flour, and put in a pan 
with a small piece of fat or drippings. When the meat is seared, 
add a little water and baste every ten minutes. When one side is 
thoroughly browned, turn over and brown the other side. When 
done, remove the roast; pour off almost all of the fat and make a 
brown sauce according to the directions in the chapter on 
"Sauces." 

If the meat is very lean it is a good plan to lay thin slices of fat 
meat, bacon or pork over the top. 

Broiling 

The object of boiling is to coagulate as quickly as possible all 
the albumen on the surface of the meat, sealing up the pores so 
that none of the juices may escape. It is therefore a good plan to 
warm the gridiron before putting on the meat so that none of the 
heat may be conducted away. The broiling should be done over 

67 



TV/TT? A TC Planned for a 

iVlISA 1 O Family of Four 

a clear fire at least two inches away from the gridiron. Meat 
cooked by this method is more wholesome than meat cooked in 
any other way; but if the fire is not hot, most of the juices will be 
lost. Season with salt, pepper and butter when the meat is done; 
do not season before cooking, as salt draws out the juices. 

Pan-broiling is less desirable than broiling over hot coals, 
though when properly done the meat has much the same flavor 
and appearance. Have the pan red hot and if the meat is very 
lean, rub the pan with fat; but do not leave any fat in the pan. 
Sear the meat quickly on one side, then on the other; then cook, 
turning several times. Season and serve. 

Boiling 

Boiling is one of the easiest methods of cooking meat, but It is 
not satisfactory unless the proper method is followed. In making 
soup the meat is put in cold water to draw out the juices ; in boiling 
it should be put in hot water, so that the meat and not the water 
may retain the juices and flavoring. Some of them will necessarily 
escape, but the boiling water coagulates the albumen on the sur- 
face of the meat, forming a sort of coat. 

Salt meat should be soaked in cold water before boiling, but 
fresh meat should simply be wiped with a damp cloth. Have the 
kettle scrupulously clean; put in it enough water to cover the 
meat and when boiling drop in the meat. Boil hard for five 
minutes; then draw the kettle aside and let the meat cook slowly. 
Cover closely and remove all scum that rises. 

Frjring 

Frying is cooking in very hot fat, and the secret of success is 
to have the fat hot enough to harden the outer surface of the meat 
immediately and deep enough to cover the meat. As the fat can 
be saved and used many times, the use of a large quantity is not 
extravagant. 

Have a frying pan with a wire basket and arrange the pieces 
of meat or croquettes so that they will not touch each other. 
Plunge them in the fat, testing it first with a small piece of bread, 
which should brown in thirty seconds. When cooked, drain the 
meat over the hot fat; shake the basket and place the pieces on 
soft paper so that the fat may be absorbed. 

Olive oil is best for frying; but as it is expensive for general use, 

68 



Planned for a T\/n7 AT?\ 

Family of Four 1.VX JZ/A X O 

various compounds such as cottolene, suctinc, crisco, etc., may 
be used. These on the whole are better than lard, which is easily 
absorbed and therefore apt to make the food greasy. Suet and 
drippings are cheapest; but suet alone cools quickly and leaves 
a tallowy taste. 

Dry the meat; roll it in fine bread crumbs ; then dip it in beaten 
egg diluted with water; roll it in bread crumbs again and fry. 
The white of the egg hardens immediately if the fat is sufficiently 
hot and the fat cannot penetrate to the meat. Mix a little salt 
and pepper with the bread crumbs. 

Sauteing 

Sauteing is commonly called frying: it consists in cooking with 
a little fat in a shallow pan. This method is apt to make the 
articles greasy and is therefore to be used with caution. Butter 
is generally used, though olive oil is more wholesome. 

Braising 

Braising is a cross between boiling and baking and is one of 
the best methods of cooking large pieces of tough, lean meat. 
The meat is placed in a closely covered pan partly filled with hot 
stock or water and cooked slowly in the oven. Bay leaf, carrot, 
onion and herbs are added, and the meat is usually seared first 
to prevent escape of the juices in the water. 

Stewing 

Stewing consists in cooking meat in a little water in a closely 
covered vessel. Thickening and vegetables are usually added. 
Cut the meat in small pieces and brown over the fire; add boiling 
water; cook for a few minutes ; then reduce the heat and cook very 
slowly. The long-continued action of the heat softens the fibers 
and renders the coarsest and cheapest kinds of meat tender and 
palatable. 

Fricasseeing 

To fricassee meat saute it first to keep in its juices, then stew 
until tender and serve with white or brown sauce made from the 
juice in the pan.

PURCHASING BEEF 

Roasting — ribs, loin, rump and pin-bone. Second cut from 
thinnest side of ribs and sirloin are best pieces. 

Broiling — loin, rump, skirt. Tenderloin and sirloin the best. 

Boiling — round. 

Stewing — round, brisket, etc. 

Soup — shin, leg, neck, etc. 

Broth — ^neck, round, etc. 

POT ROAST 

Pot roast calls for brisket or round and is one of the cheaper 
dishes of meat. Wipe the beef with a clean, wet cloth; sear by 
placing in a hot frying pan and turning until the entire surface is 
browned, then put in a kettle with not more than a cup of hot 
water; cover tightly and keep just below the boihng point. Do 
not let the meat boil dry, but add only enough water to keep it 
from burning. Cook until tender and add pared potatoes one half 
hour before it is done. Serve with brown sauce made from the 
fat in the pot. 

ROAST BEEF WITH YORKSHIRE PUDDING 

2 cups flour 3 eggs 

1/2 teaspoon salt 2 cups milk . 

Roast the beef as usual. Mix the flour with the salt; add the 
beaten eggs and the milk and stir until the batter is smooth. 
Pour into a shallow baking pan containing a little of the drippings 
from the roast beef. Let the batter be only one inch thick and 
bake from thirty to forty-five minutes, basting, after it is risen, 
with some of the fat from the pan in which the beef is roasting. 
Cut into squares and place it around the roast beef.

pings; season, dredge with flour and brown again. Raise the 
beef on a trivet, put in water to half cover it, and the vegetables 
sliced or cut into cubes, bay leaf and parsley. Cover closely and 
cook below the boiling point for about four hours. Remove meat 
to platter; surround with vegetables and make a brown sauce of 
the strained liquor. 



BEEF TERRAPIN 

Shin of beef Vi pound butter 

Salt and red pepper 1 cup cream 

3 blades mace 1 heaping teaspoon flour 

1 wineglass sherry or Madeira 

Have the shin of beef sawed through the bone in three places; 
put it in a vessel over the fire; cover with boiling water and throw 
in a tablespoon of salt. Boil slowly until tender (three or four 
hours), adding more water if necessary. When the meat is done, 
remove and cool it, saving the broth for soup. Cut the cold meat 
into half-inch dice; add seasoning and butter and the flour well 
mixed with the cream. Bring to a boil, stir in the wine and serve. 



PLANKED STEAK 

Nearly all planking boards are now fitted out with steel rods 
or bars to hold the steak in place and grooves for the conservation 
of the gravy. Before using, heat the board very hot before the 
fire or in the oven, lay the steak on and fasten into place. Brush 
over with olive oil or melted butter; dust with salt and pepper 
and lay the plank in the broiler chamber of a gas range for at least 
fifteen minutes. Baste frequently and reverse the plank from time 
to time. 

While the steak is cooking press fresh-boiled potatoes through a 
ricer; season with salt and pepper; add a little butter and cream; 
and beat with a fork until very light. When the steak is nearly 
done take the board from the oven; put the beaten potato into a 
pastry bag and force through the tube, rose fashion, at regular 
intervals along the edge of the steak on the board. 

Between the potato roses make little mounds of cauliflower, 
mushrooms, spinach or onions. Return to the oven and allow 
them to brown delicately. Garnish with cress and send the steak 
to the table on the plank, setting it on a large platter or tray.

PLANKED STEAK WITH OYSTERS 

Have an extra sirloin neatly trimmed; put it on the broiler; 
broil five minutes on one side; turn and broil five minutes on the 
other side. Make the planking board very hot while the steak is 
broiling. Put the steak on; garnish the board quickly with mashed 
potatoes and put it under the broiler. Turn the steak once. Dust 
with salt and pepper and rub with butter. Cover the top with 
broiled oysters, then run it again under the broiler for a few 
minutes. Serve very hot. 

PLANKED SALISBURY STEAK 

1 pound lean beef Mashed potatoes 

Salt and pepper 3 baked bananas 

1 teaspoon onion juice 1 cup cream sauce 

V2 cup grated horseradish 



Chop the meat very fine; season with salt, pepper and onion 
juice; make it into three cakes. Put the cakes on a hot plank and 
then under the broiler. It is wise to turn a Salisbury steak once 
during the cooking. When done garnish the plank with mashed 
potatoes; put it back until brown. Have ready a baked banana 
for each cake. Make a cream sauce; add to it half a cup of grated 
horseradish; fill this around the board; put the baked bananas 
on top and serve. 

CORNED BEEF 

All corned beef requires to be boiled slowly. Put it on in cold 
water; allow twenty -five or thirty minutes for every pound of beef. 
Let it come slowly to a boil, then allow it to simmer. 

Cabbage is usually served with corned beef but should not be 
boiled with it. Parsnips or turnips may be served if preferred. 

PICKLE FOR CORNING BEEF 

3 gallons water 1 ounce pearlash 

63^ pounds salt 2V2 pounds sugar 

1 pint molasses 

This pickle is sufficient for fifty pounds of beef. When salt and 
sugar are thoroughly dissolved lay in the beef. It will be ready 
for use in twelve or fourteen days, but can remain in the pickle 
five or six weeks without injury.

and when done make a brown sauce in the pan. 

The stuffing may be varied by the addition of chopped meat, 
celery, onion, oysters, mushrooms, etc.

POULTRY AND GAME 



POULTRY AND GAME 

POULTRY and game are, at least for those who live m the 
city, more expensive than the red meats, but they are fairly 
rich in nutritive value and wherever possible should be intro- 
duced into the menu — for the sake of variety if nothing else. 

In marketing, see that the bird is plump and not unduly fat. 
The skin should be clear and free from blotches and the flesh 
firm. Chickens have soft feet, soft breast bone and a great 
many pin feathers; fowl have rough feet, rigid breast bone and 
coarse, hairy skin. A spring chicken should be chosen for broil- 
ing or frying; a young chicken for roasting; a fowl for stewing. 
Capons are considered the choicest of poultry; cock turkeys are 
usually considered better than hen turkeys. 

TO DRESS POULTRY 

Pick off the pin feathers; singe over a gas burner or burning 
paper to remove the hairs; cut off the head. Cut the skin at the 
side of the leg joint and very lightly over the top, bending the foot 
back to loosen the ligaments on the upper part of the leg; pull 
out each separately, using a wooden skewer. Then cut through 
the tough muscle until the hard ligaments on the back are reached 
and pull them out in the same way. Remove the foot and treat 
the other leg in the same way. 

Make an incision below the breastbone just large enough to 
admit the hand. Keeping the fingers close to the breastbone 
reach carefully into the body until the heart is reached; loosen the 
membranes and remove the entrails. Be very careful not to break 
the gall bladder which lies imbedded in the liver, as even a slight 
break will make the whole chicken bitter. Save the heart, gizzard 
and liver; remove the gall bladder from the liver very carefully; 
cut the fat and membranes from the gizzard; make an incision 
through the muscle without cutting the little grist bag inside, and 
peel off the muscle; remove membranes and arteries from the 

, 93 



POULTRY AND GAME Fa''iT qI rJu'r 

heart. Remove the kidneys and lungs which adhere closely to 
the body wall; then cut the skin on the under side of the throat 
and remove windpipe and crop ; remove the oil bag from the under 
side of the tail. Pull down the neck skin and cut off the neck 
close to the body. 

Be sure that every particle is removed; then wash by letting 
water run through. Do not soak in water, as water draws out the 
juices; but if there is a disagreeable odor, wash thoroughly in soda 
water. Wipe inside and out. 



GIBLETS 

Heart, liver and gizzard constitute the giblets, and to these the 
neck is usually added. Wash them; put them in cold water and 
cook until tender. This will take several hours. Serve with the 
chicken; or mash the liver, mince the heart and gizzard and add 
them to the brown sauce. Save the stock in which they are 
cooked for making the sauce. 



TO TRUSS POULTRY 

Press the thighs and wings close against the body; fasten se- 
curely with skewers and tie with string. Draw the skin of the 
neck to the back and fasten it. 



TO STUFF POULTRY 

Use enough stuffing to fill the bird but do not pack it tightly or 
the stuffing will be soggy. Close the small openings with a skewer; 
sew the larger one with linen thread and a long needle. Remove 
skewers and strings before serving. 



ROAST CHICKEN 

Stuff and truss the chicken; season with pepper and dredge 
with flour. Put in a dripping pan with a little salt pork if the 
chicken is not especially fat. When heated add hot water and 
baste frequently. The oven should be hot and the time necessary 
for a large chicken will be about an hour and a half. When done, 
remove the chicken, pour off the grease and make a brown sauce 
in the pan. 

94 



gii;?Sfon-o^ur POULTRY AND GAME 

STEWED CHICKEN 

Draw the chicken and divide it into pieces as follows: Cut 
through the loose skin between the leg and the body, bend the leg 
over and cut off at the joint; then cut through the flesh and sepa- 
rate the upper and lower parts of the leg at the joint. Do the 
same with the other leg; then cut off the wings. Make an in- 
cision in the skin near the vent and cut the membrane lying be- 
tween the breastbone and the tail, down to the backbone, on each 
side. Cut the ribs through the cartilage, separate the collar-bone 
and break the backbone just below the ribs. Separate the side 
bones from the back, and remove the bone from the breast. Never 
chop the bones, but divide them smoothly at the joints. 

Season the pieces with pepper and salt and cover with boiling 
water. Cover and stew gently until tender. Remove the chicken. 
Place the pieces in a colander on a plate in the oven to drain, and 
thicken the gravy by adding a tablespoon of flour rubbed with a 
tablespoon of butter. Add seasoning to taste, a little chopped 
parsley and milk to whiten. Beat an egg until light; pour on it 
part of the gravy, beating carefully to prevent lumps ; return to the 
remainder of the gravy; bring to a boil and pour over the chicken. 



BROILED CHICKEN 

After the chickens have been drawn, split through the back, 
flatten with a cleaver or chopper and lay on a heated gridiron over 
a bright fire. They must be constantly watched and turned sev- 
eral times. When done, lay on a hot platter, season with pepper, 
salt and butter, and serve with giblet sauce. 



PLANKED CHICKEN 

2 spring chickens i/^ pound mushrooms 

1 cup boiled rice 1 glass guava jelly 

Stew the mushrooms; put the chicken either in the oven or 
under the broiler, bone side to the hottest part of the fire. Heat 
the plank; put the chicken on, bone side down; dust with salt 
and pepper and broil on the board under the gas for half an hour; 
garnish with the rice; pour over the mushrooms. Place at the 
corners small bread patties, holding the guava jelly.

BARBECUED CHICKEN 



Prepare the chickens as for broiling; lay them in a dripping pan 
with the skin side up; season with pepper and salt and put in a 
hot oven. Cook for about three quarters of an hour, basting oc- 
casionally with butter and water. Serve with brown sauce made 
as for broiled chicken. 

FRIED CHICKEN 

Prepare young chickens, dividing them as for stewing; wash 
and drain but do not dry the pieces. Roll each thoroughly in 
flour mixed with salt and pepper. Drop in deep fat and fry until 
tender. 

If the chickens are not very young it will be safer to stew them 
before frying. 

CHICKEN FRICASSEE 

Prepare the chicken as for stewing; put in a frying pan with a little 
water and cook slowly, adding salt when the chicken is half done. 
When nearly done, allow the water to boil away until the pan is 
almost dry; add butter or pork fat and saute the chicken until 
brown. Lay the pieces on toast; make a brown sauce in the pan 
and pour around them. 

This is a good way to serve fowls, which are made tender by the 
long cooking. 

CHICKEN PIE 

1 chicken Yolk of hard-boiled egg 

Salt and pepper V^ tablespoon parsley 

1 tablespoon flour V^ pound salt pork 
Pie crust 

Prepare the chicken as for fricassee; put the giblets in cold 
water and stew until nearly done; add the chicken; season with 
pepper and salt and simmer for twenty minutes. Remove with a 
skimmer and make a gravy of the broth by adding the flour, egg 
yolk and parsley. Line the sides of a deep baking pan with pie 
crust; place an inverted cup in the center; put in the chicken 
in layers covered with strips of salt pork and moistened with the 
gravy. Pour on the remainder of the gravy; cover with pie 
crust, making the edges as firm as possible and cutting a few 
slashes. Bake slowly for nearly an hour.

been rubbed, the chopped eggs, seasoning and parsley. Drain 
the oysters; add them to the gravy; cook until the edges curl. 
Pour the gravy over the chicken and serve. 

ROAST DUCK 

Draw the ducks; stuff, truss and roast the same as chicken. 
Serve with giblet sauce and currant jelly. If small, the ducks 
should be cooked in an hour. 

ROAST TURKEY 

Singe and clean the turkey the same as chicken. Fill with plain 
or oyster stuffing; roast and serve with giblet sauce and cranberry 
sauce. If the turkey is very large it will require three hours or 
longer; a small one will require only an hour and a half. Baste 
frequently, as turkey is apt to be more dry than chicken. 

PIGEON PIE 

Clean and cut each bird in four quarters. Line the sides of 
a deep baking dish with plain crust and put a layer of salt pork 
in the bottom. Then put in a layer of birds, seasoned with pep-

butter. Put in other layers to fill the dish; cover with thin slices 
of pork; pour over all a cup or more of broth or water; cover 
with crust and bake for about an hour. Leave an opening in the 
center of the crust and if the pie seems dry, add more water. 



RABBIT 

The rabbit when bought should be fresh and the body free 
from unpleasant odor. If young, the paws and ears will be soft; 
if old, they will be stiff. 

Rabbit may be cooked in a variety of ways, as fricassee or pie, 
following the recipe for chicken, or broiled like chicken. 

Skin the rabbit; singe it; remove the entrails and wipe well 
inside and out with a damp cloth. Split it down the back, and 
unless it is to be broiled, divide each half into four pieces. 

PANNED RABBIT 

1 rabbit Salt and pepper 

2 eggs 1 tablespoon chopped parsley 
Little grated nutmeg 14 cup fine bread crumbs 

Divide the rabbit at the joints and stew until tender. Butter 
a pan and lay the pieces over the bottom. Beat the eggs; mix 
with the other ingredients and spread over the rabbit. Set in a 
hot oven and bake until brown.

Quail may be boiled like chicken and served with currant jelly 
or roasted. For roasting truss the legs and wings to the body; 
cover the breast of each with a slice of bacon; and roast for 
fifteen or twenty minutes, basting frequently with a little water. 
Serve with giblet sauce to which a glass of port wine has been 
added. 

ROASTED GROUSE 

Clean the grouse the same as chicken; put a small piece of butter 
inside each bird and truss into shape. Roast in a hot oven twenty- 
five or thirty minutes, basting frequently with melted butter. 
Boil the liver until tender; mash it to a paste with butter and 
seasoning; spread over thin slices of buttered toast moistened 
with juice from the pan, and lay the grouse on these slices. 

HAUNCH OF VENISON ROASTED 

Wipe the meat carefully with a wet cloth and cover with a large 
sheet of buttered paper. Make a thick paste of flour and water; 
roll out three quarters of an inch thick; lay over the fat side of 
the haunch; cover with three or four sheets of thick white paper 
and tie securely with cord. Put in a dripping pan and roast, 
basting frequently to prevent the paper and string from burning, 
A haunch of twelve pounds will require three hours to roast; a 
larger one longer. Half an hour before it is done, remove from the

FORCEMEATS, STUFFINGS, ETC. 

FORCEMEATS are useful for filling timbales and for garnishing 
other dishes. When intended for balls, the consistency should 
be tested by poaching a small quantity in boiling water. If too 
thin, more bread crumbs should be added. 

StujQSngs are too common to need any introduction. They are 
what make roast poultry palatable to most people, and a good 
stuffing is an addition to any roasted or baked meat.

SAUCES 



SAUCES 

THE preparation of a sauce is of as much importance as the 
preparation of a dish itself and is frequently the supreme 
test of the cook's skill. Some of the famous cooks of history, 
like Bechamel, the celebrated chef of Louis XIV, for instance, 
are remembered chiefly through a sauce of their own invention. 

The foundation for almost all of the common sauces is what 
the French call 'Woux." This is butter and flour cooked together 
and thinned with milk, water or other liquid. Under no circum- 
stances should a sauce be thickened by adding a mixture of flour 
and water, as in this case the flour is seldom well cooked, or by 
adding flour alone, as this method is certain to cause lumps. 
The flour should be allowed to cook before the liquid is added. 

BROWN SAUCE 

1 tablespoon butter or fat 1 cup stock 

1 tablespoon flour Salt and pepper 

Brown the flour in the butter, stirring it until smooth; then add 
the seasoning and the stock, stirring constantly to prevent lumps. 

If the sauce is to be served with a roast, use a little of the fat in 
which the meat was roasted instead of the butter and make the 
sauce in the roasting pan. For those who like the flavor of onion 
it is a good plan to roast an onion with the meat, adding it to the 
sauce. 

Onion juice, Worcestershire sauce, tomato catsup or mushroom 
catsup may be added as flavoring if desired. 

GIBLET SAUCE 

If brown sauce is to be served with roast chicken or turkey, boil 
the giblets three or four hours; mash or chop them, and add them 
to the sauce.

EGGS 



! 



EGGS 

EGGS and the foods into which they enter are favorite articles 
of diet in the majority of households. They are an agree- 
able substitute for meat, and, judged by their composition and 
digestibility, are worthy of the high esteem in which they are 
held. They are also valuable from an economical standpoint, 
for even when high in price they usually make a cheaper dish 
than meat. 

BOILED EGGS 

Soft-boiled eggs may be prepared in two ways. The eggs may 
be dropped carefully into boiling water and boiled three minutes, 
or they may be placed in a covered vessel of boiling water and 
allowed to stand in a warm place (but not on the stove) for ten 
minutes. Eggs prepared in this way are sometimes called "Cod- 
dled Eggs.'* They are much more delicate and digestible than 
the usual "Boiled Eggs.'* 

Hard-boiled eggs should be cooked in boiling water for fifteen 
or twenty minutes and then dropped in cold water to prevent the 
yolk from turning dark. 

POACHED EGGS 

Bring salted water to a boil in a shallow vessel; remove from the 
fire and slip the eggs carefully into it, breaking each into a small 
saucer first. Place the pan over a moderate fire and let the water 
come slowly to a boil. By this time the whites of the eggs should 
be delicately set. Lift the eggs carefully; trim off the ragged 
edges and serve on slices of buttered toast. 

FRIED EGGS 

Melt in a frying-pan a large piece of butter; or use the fat 
of ham or bacon. When hot, drop in the eggs, one at a time, 
being careful not to break the yolk. When the white of the egg 

121 



"17/^ /"^ O Planned for a 

J2/^VtO Family of Four 

is set they are done, though some persons Hke them turned over 
and cooked on the other side. Remove from the pan with a cake- 
turner and serve at once. 

SHIRRED EGGS 

Eggs may be shirred in one large baking dish or pan, but are 
better and look more tempting in individual ramekins or custard 
cups. Place a small piece of butter in the bottom of each; break 
the egg; drop it in without breaking the yolk ; season with pepper 
and salt and put another small piece of butter on the top. Bake 
in a hot oven until the white is set, and serve immediately. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

4 eggs V2 tablespoon butter 

4 tablespoons milk or water Salt and pepper 

Break the eggs in a bowl and beat them thoroughly; add the 
milk and seasoning and beat again. Melt the butter in a frying- 
pan over the fire; pour in the eggs; stir occasionally but not con- 
stantly until they thicken; then serve at once. 

GRIDDLED EGGS 

Heat a griddle as if for baking cakes; butter it lightly and ar- 
range small muffin rings on it. Drop an egg in each and turn as 
soon^as lightly browned. Griddled eggs resemble fried eggs but 
are far more delicate. 

CURRIED EGGS 

6 hard-boiled eggs V2 teaspoon salt 

1 cup curry sauce V4 teaspoon pepper 

Cut the eggs in half and slice enough of the white off the end of 
each to make them stand upright. Sprinkle with salt and pepper 
and serve on a hot platter with the sauce poured around them. 

PLAIN OMELET 

4 eggs Salt and pepper 

4 tablespoons milk or water Vz tablespoon butter 

Beat the eggs very light, yolks and whites separately; then fold

MEAT SUBSTITUTES 



MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

IN the majority of households meat is still the central article 
of every meal; but there is an almost universal desire to 
decrease the amount of meat consumed, if not totally to elimi- 
nate it from the diet. The desire arises partly from thirst for 
variety, partly from reasons of economy, and partly from a grow- 
ing distaste for animal food. ^Vhatever the reason, the housewife 
is obliged to turn more and more to her list of meat-substitute 
dishes. Eggs have already been treated in a previous chapter, 
but they are by no means the only substitutes. 

Foods which are served in place of meat should be rich in 
protein and fat and should also be savory. Cheese naturally 
suggests itself, for it contains nearly twice as much protein, weight 
for weight, as beef of average composition, and its fuel value is 
almost twice as great. In view of these facts it seems strange 
that it is not more widely used. One reason is, doubtless, that 
cheese is generally considered indigestible and liable to cause 
constipation; but investigations of the United States Depart- 
ment of Agriculture have happily disproved this as well as many 
other current superstitions in regard to food. 

Care, however, should be exercised in planning meals in which 
cheese is employed as a substitute for meat. As cheese dishes 
are inclined to be somewhat "heavy," they should be offset by 
crisp, watery vegetables, watercress, celery, lettuce, fruit salads 
and light desserts, preferably fresh or cooked fruit. Another 
point, too, is to be considered. Whether raw or cooked, cheese 
seems to call for the harder kinds of bread — crusty rolls or bis- 
cuit, zwieback, toast, pulled bread or hard crackers. 

Dried peas, beans and lentils are also excellent substitutes for 
meat. Since they contain as much protein as meat and since 

•133 



MEAT SUBSTITUTES

their fuel value is almost equal to that of cheese, it is not sur- 
prising to find that they are extensively used among all people 
who, either from necessity or choice, eat little or no meat. The 
impoverished Mexican uses at almost every meal the native bean 
or frijole, made palatable with green vegetables and chile or red 
pepper. There is a Hindoo proverb, "Rice is good, but lentils 
are my life," showing in what esteem the protein of the lentil 
was held even among ancient peoples. 

There is, of course, the objection commonly raised to the indi- 
gestibility of these foods, and they can hardly be recommended 
for persons with delicate stomachs. Rightly prepared, however, 
and eaten in moderate quantities, they cannot be considered 
indigestible in the ordinary sense of the word. The removal of 
the skin aids greatly to increase the digestibility and hinders the 
formation of gas. 

Nuts also may be employed as substitutes for meat; for they 
are very rich in oil, with only a small percentage of starch and 
sugar, and are also rich in nitrogen. And though frequently 
indigestible when taken by themselves, if properly combined 
with other foods they should be capable of digestion by any 
normal person.

DRIED PEAS, BEANS AND LENTILS 

The dried legumes are excellent if properly cooked, and form a 
palatable dish if simply boiled until tender and seasoned with but- 
ter, pepper and salt. 

The first important step is the swelling and softening of the 
legume by soaking in water a number of hours, usually not less 
than eight, and the removal of such parts as will not soften by 
cooking. The skin of the ripened pea and lentil is easily removed, 
and both peas and lentils are therefore more easily prepared than 
beans. Many kinds of beans, however, after proper soaking may 
be freed from their skins by stirring in water. The skins rise to 
the top and can be skimmed off. The large lima beans after 
soaking may easily be slipped out of the skins by pressing them 
between the fingers. 

Soft water should be used for both soaking and boiling the 
legumes; but if neither is available, simply boil the water before 
using and pour it from the sediment. In soaking beans baking 
soda may be used to soften the water (using a quarter teaspoon 
of soda dissolved in one quart of water to every pound of beans), 

135

as it increases the digestibility of the beans and does not destroy 
the flavor. 

Dried peas, beans and lentils are better if cooked slowly all day. 
If desired, the flavor may be improved by the addition of onion, 
flavoring herbs or meat stock. The legumes may be left whole or 
mashed through a sieve. In either case they will be greatly im- 
proved by the addition of butter and abundant seasoning; the 
salt should be cooked with them, allowing one half tablespoon for 
one pint of beans, and the pepper added with the butter. 

LENTILS A LA CREOLE 

V2 cup lentils 1 small onion 

1 tablespoon butter 1 cup tomatoes 

1 green pepper Salt and pepper 

1 cup boiled rice 

Let the lentils soak over night in water, adding a pinch of bak- 
ing soda if the water is hard. In the morning, drain; cover with 
fresh water and let simmer for one half hour; drain again; cover 
with hot water and let simmer slowly until the lentils are tender. 
Put the butter in a saucepan and melt ; add the pepper and onion, 
both finely chopped; stir and cook until the butter is browned. 
Add the tomatoes, canned or raw; season to taste; and into them 
empty the lentils after they have been drained and mashed through 
a colander. Cook slowly for about thirty minutes; pour into a 
deep platter and surround with a border of rice. 

BAKED LENTILS 

1 pint lentils V2 small onion 

1 pint water V^ teaspoon salt 

3 ounces salt pork V4 teaspoon pepper 

Pick and wash the lentils and soak them in cold water over 
night. In the morning put them over the fire in a large saucepan 
with about a quart of water. As soon as the water begins to boil 
the lentils will rise to the top. Remove them with a skimmer;

center, and pour over them the pint of boiling water, in which the 
salt and pepper have been mixed. Bake in a moderate oven four 
or five hours. The lentils must be kept moist and it may be neces- 
sary to add a little water from time to time.

BAKED BEANS 

1 pint dried beans V2 teaspoon salt 

Vi pound salt pork Dash of pepper 

1 cup water 1 tablespoon molasses 

Soak the beans over night, adding a little soda to the water. 
In the morning cook them gently until the skins begin to break; 
then drain off the water, saving one cup. Empty the beans into 
a baking dish; bury the pork in them, rind side up, and pour over 
them the cup of water saved, into which has been stirred the salt, 
pepper and molasses. If desired, a little mustard or onion or 
more molasses may be added. Cover the beans and let them bake 
in a slow oven for four or five hours. Serve with Boston brown 
bread. 

PUREE OF DRIED BEANS 

1 pint beans 

1 tablespoon butter or drippings 

14 teaspoon sugar i cup hot milk 

Cook the beans until very soft; drain well, saving the water, 
and rub through a puree sieve. Put one pint of the strained beans 
in a saucepan with the butter or savory drippings and seasoning 
and add the hot milk gradually until a thick mush is formed. Heap 
the puree in the center of a hot platter and garnish with fried bacon, 
sausages or mutton chops. 

A soup may be made with the water in which the beans were 
cooked and the remainder of the strained beans. 

Dried peas may be prepared in the same way. 



DRIED BEANS SAUTE 

1 pint beans V2 tablespoon salt 

iy2 tablespoons butter or drippings V^ teaspoon pepper 

Soak the beans and cook them until tender but not broken; then 
drain off the water and save it for soup. Put the butter or savory 
drippings in a pan over the fire and when hot put in the drained 
beans which have been seasoned. Cook over a hot fire for fifteen 
minutes, frequently turning the beans with a fork; then cover 
and let them cook for half an hour where they will not burn. If 
desired moist, a half cup of stock, milk or water may be added 
before putting them to cook for the last half hour.

2 cups pink beans 1 tablespoon drippings 

6 cups water 1 chile pepper 

1 small onion Salt 

Wash the beans and soak them in the water over night. In the 
morning add the onion; boil gently until soft; then drain, saving 
the water. Put the grease in a large skillet; when sizzling hot 
add the drained beans and stir thoroughly until each bean seems 
to have a coating of the fat and begins to burst. Add one cup of 
the water in w^hich the beans were boiled; gently crush a few of 
the beans to thicken it; add the remainder of the water, salt to 
taste and the chile pepper, finely chopped. Simmer until the beans 
are almost dry and serve. 

COTTAGE CHEESE 

Set a gallon or more of thick sour milk in warm water, or in a 
warm place until it reaches a temperature of 180° F. Let stand 
at this temperature for an hour or more, until the curd separates 
from the whey and seems firm. Turn gently into a piece of cheese- 
cloth; hang up to drain for several hours; chop and mix salt and 
cream through the mass, working the mixture well with the hands.

BAKED MACARONI WITH CHEESE 

1 cup broken macaroni 1 pint cream sauce 

2 quarts boiling salted water 1 cup grated cheese 

1 cup buttered bread cnmibs 

Cook the macaroni in the water for twenty or thirty minutes; 
drain and blanch with cold water. Put the macaroni in a pudding 
dish in layers, covering each with cream sauce and grated cheese 
and making the top layer of bread crumbs. Bake in the oven until 
the crumbs are brown. 

BAKED CRACKERS WITH CHEESE 

10 butter crackers or Boston 1 tablespoon flour 

crackers 14 teaspoon salt 

11/2 cups milk 1/2 cup buttered bread 
1 cup grated cheese crumbs 

Split the crackers if they are thick and with a sharp knife cut 
them into pieces of uniform size. Pour the milk over them and 
drain it off at once. Then make a sauce with the milk, flour, 
cheese and salt. Into a buttered baking dish put alternate layers 
of soaked cracker and sauce. Cover with bread crumbs and brown 
in the oven. 

MIGAS 

Soak slices of stale bread and squeeze dry. Put olive oil or 
drippings in a frying pan and when boiling hot drop in an onion 
chopped fine, a little ground chile and a pinch of sweet marjoram. 
Lay the slices of bread in this with plenty of fresh cheese (prefer- 
ably goats' cheese), finely broken, and fry for about ten minutes. 
Remove to a hot plate; cover with grated cheese, stoned ripe 
olives and chopped hard-boiled egg.

CHEESE SOUFFLE 

2 tablespoons butter 

2 tablespoons flour Dash of red pepper 

V^ cup scalded milk Vi cup grated cheese 

3 eggs 

Melt the butter and mix thoroughly with the flour; then add 
the hot milk gradually and the salt, red pepper and cheese. Re- 
move from the fire and add the beaten yolks. Cool the mixture; 
fold in the beaten whites; pour into a buttered baking dish and 
cook about twenty minutes in a slow oven. Serve at once or the 
souffle will not be light. 

CHEESE ROLLS 

A large variety of rolls may be made by combining cooked 
beans, lentils or peas with cheese and adding bread crumbs to make 
the mixture thick enough to form into a roll. Beans are usually 
mashed, but peas or lima beans may be combined whole with 
bread crumbs and grated cheese and enough of the water in which 
the vegetables have been cooked to insure the right consistency. 

Chopped spinach, beet greens or lettuce may be used instead of 
the legumes if desired. 

Cottage cheese, cream cheese, American or English dairy cheese 
may be used. . 

BAKED RICE 

2 cups boiled rice V^ cup milk 

1 cup grated cheese Salt and red pepper 

1 tablespoon butter Bread crumbs 

Arrange the rice in a baking dish in layers, covering each with 
cheese, a little milk, butter, salt and red pepper. Spread bread 
crumbs over all and bake in a moderate oven until the crumbs are 
browned. 

English dairy cheese is preferred for this, although American 
cheese will do. 

ENGLISH RICE 

1 cup rice 1 cup cooked tomatoes 

1 cup chopped pecans V^ teaspoon salt 

1/2 saltspoon pepper 

Wash, boil and drain the rice. Strain the tomatoes and add to 
them the seasoning. Put a layer of rice in the bottom of a baking

dish, then a layer of nuts, then rice, then nuts again until the entire 
quantity is used, making the last layer of rice. Pour the tomatoes 
over this and bake in a moderate oven thirty minutes. 

PEANUT BUTTER 

Nuts are found indigestible chiefly because of the impossibility 
of grinding them fine enough with the teeth. The value of nut 
butters is therefore obvious. 

Almost any kind of nut will make good butter, but peanuts are 
perhaps the best and the most generally available. Pound freshly 
roasted nuts in a mortar or put them through a chopper, using the 
knife designed especially for the making of nut butters. Season 
with salt and add a little olive oil if desired. In most cases the oil 
from the nuts is sufficient to moisten the butter. 

NUT AND FRUIT CHEESE 

y^ pound figs 2 ounces almonds 

14 pound seeded raisins 2 ounces pine nuts 

14 pound dates 2 oimces Brazil nuts 
l^ pound pecans 

Wash the fruit and stone the dates. Mix thoroughly with the 
nuts and put through a meat chopper. Press the mixture into 
baking powder tins and stand in a cool place. When wanted for 
use loosen the sides with a thin knife-blade and turn out on a 
board. Cut into thin slices and serve in the place of meat or put 
between thin slices of buttered bread. 

NUT ROAST

and cook until tender. Drain once more; throw away the water 
and press the lentils through a colander. To them add the nuts, 
either ground or chopped, the bread crumbs and seasoning and 
milk sufficient to make the mixture the consistency of mush. Put 
into a greased baking dish; bake in a moderate oven for an hour; 
turn out on a heated platter; garnish with parsley or watercress 
and serve.

LEFT-OVERS 



LEFT-OVERS 

LEFT-OVERS are a problem to every housewife, and it is 
the wise cook who can either so merge them with other 
things that the identity is lost or make of them new dishes so 
palatable as to be desired rather than dreaded. With a little 
care and forethought, however, this can readily be done. 

The manner of serving these dishes should be studied, for 
dainty ways of serving food have a usefulness beyond their 
esthetic value. Every one knows how quickly a feeble appetite 
is tempted by a tastefully garnished dish when the same material 
well cooked but carelessly served would seem altogether unpal- 
atable. Even "left-overs" may be made as attractive in appear- 
ance as fresh dishes. 

There are throughout this book many recipes that call for 
cold meats and vegetables, so that this chapter is not the only 
one to be studied by the economical cook. See especially the 
chapter on "Entrees." 

BAKED HASH

VEGETABLES 



VEGETABLES 

\ ITEGETABLES are prepared for the table in several ways, but 
■ the most common method of cooking them is in boiHng water 
or in the related method of steaming. On the whole, it may be 
said that the simpler methods of preparing are to be preferred, in 
the majority of cases bringing the food to its most digestible form. 

The changes that take place in the cooking of vegetables are 
briefly these: The cellular tissue is softened and loosened; the 
nitrogenous substances are coagulated; the starch granules 
absorb moisture, swell and burst; and the flavor is developed. 
The food is rendered more digestible and in most cases more pal- 
atable. Over-cooking, however, changes and toughens the 
texture of vegetable foods, destroys the coloring matter and 
injures the flavor. 

All vegetables should be thoroughly cleansed before being put 
on to cook, and if for any reason a green vegetable has lost its 
crispness or firmness it should be soaked in very cold water until 
it has regained freshness. Vegetables that form in heads, such 
as cabbage, cauliflower and Brussels sprouts, should be soaked, 
heads down, in salted cold water to which a few teaspoons of 
vinegar may be added. If there are any worms in the vegetables 
they will crawl out. 

To secure the best results all vegetables except the dried legumes 
must be put in boiling water and the water must be brought to a 
boil again as soon as possible after the vegetables have been 
added. Herbaceous vegetables should boil rapidly all the time; 
but with tubers, roots, cauliflower, etc., the ebullition should not 
be so violent as to break the vegetables. Green lima beans and 
peas when removed from the pods must be cooked gently. If 

159 



VEGETABLES FamTol fJu? 



beans or peas are a little old, a pinch of baking soda added to the 
water in which they are boiled will make them more tender. 

The best seasoning for most vegetables is salt and butter. 
Vegetables that are drained when partly done and then cooked 
with butter and seasoning for a few minutes are usually more 
palatable than those which are cooked the entire time in a large 
amoimt of clear water and seasoned afterward. 

CABBAGE 

Divide a small head of cabbage into four parts, cutting down 
through the stock; soak for one half hour in a pan of cold water 
to which has been added a tablespoon of salt; then remove from 
the water and cut in slices. Have a large saucepan full of boiling 
water; put in the cabbage, pushing the slices under the water with 
a spoon; add a tablespoon of salt and cook from twenty-five to 
sixty minutes, according to the age of the cabbage. Drain through 
a colander; then put in a chopping bowl and mince. Season with 
butter, pepper and more salt if needed, and stand over the fire for 
a few minutes to reheat. Allow a tablespoon of butter to a pint 
of cooked cabbage. 

Keep the kitchen windows open while cooking and the door 
closed so that no impleasant odor may rise through the house. 

CABBAGE WITH PORK 

For a small head of cabbage use half a pound of minced salt 
pork. Boil the pork gently for three or four hours. Prepare the 
cabbage as for plain boiled cabbage; drain well and put on to boil 
with the pork. Boil and serve the pork with the cabbage. A 
little additional salt may be needed. 

Smoked bacon or ham or corned beef may be substituted for the 
pork; but these are usually better if cooked separately from the 
cabbage. 

LADY CABBAGE 

Prepare and cook the cabbage in the usual way. Chop very- 
fine; return to the fire; cover with milk; season; bring to a boil 
and serve.

CREAMED CABBAGE 

Make a cream sauce; add the boiled cabbage, chopped; bring 
to a boil and serve, sprinkling a little chopped parsley over the top 
of the dish. 

CAULIFLOWER 

Removi^ all the large green leaves and the greater part of the 
stalk, and soak, head down, in a pan of cold water which contains 
to each quart of water a teaspoon of salt and a teaspoon of vinegar. 
Put in a large saucepan, stem end down; cover with boiling water; 
add a tablespoon of salt and cook from twenty to thirty minutes, 
according to the size of the head and its compactness. Remove as 
soon as done, for overcooking darkens it. 

CREAMED CAULIFLOWER 

Make a cream sauce; add the boiled cauliflower, broken into 
pieces, and serve. 

CAULIFLOWER AU GRATIN 

Break boiled cauliflower into small flowerets; place in layers in 
a buttered pudding dish, covering each with cream sauce and 
grated cheese. Spread buttered bread crumbs over the top of the 
dish and bake until brown. 

CAULIFLOWER POLONAISE 

1 head cauliflower Yolks of 3 eggs 

IV2 teaspoons mustard V4 cup olive oil 

114 teaspoons salt V2 cup vinegar 

1 teaspoon powdered sugar 2 tablespoons melted butter 

V2 teaspoon paprika 1 teaspoon chopped parsley 

Cook the cauliflower as usual; when done break into flowerets 
and cover with a sauce made from the other ingredients. Mix 
the dry ingredients; add the beaten eggs, then the oil and 
vinegar. Cook over hot water until the mixture thickens; re- 
move from fire and add the butter and parsley. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS 

Remove the wilted or yellow leaves from the sprouts; cut the 
stock close to the heads, and soak in salted cold water for an hour 

161

or more. Drain well and empty them into boiling salted water, 
allowing one teaspoon of salt to two quarts of water. Boil rapidly 
for fifteen or twenty minutes, according to the size of the heads; 
when done, turn into a colander and pour cold water over the 
heads. Reheat in butter and seasoning or in cream sauce. 

KALE 

Remove all the old or tough leaves; wash the kale thoroughly 
and drain. Put it into boiling water to which has been added salt 
in the proportion of one half tablespoon to two quarts of water. 
Boil rapidly, uncovered, until the vegetable is tender; pour off the 
water; chop the kale very fine; return it to the kettle with one 
tablespoon of butter and two of meat stock or water to every pint 
of the minced vegetable. Add more salt if necessary ; cook for ten 
minutes and serve at once. The entire time for cooking varies 
from thirty to fifty minutes. 

BOILED LETTUCE 

Lettuce that has grown too old for salad may still be cooked, 
forming a very palatable dish. Wash four or five heads of lettuce, 
removing the thick bitter stalks and retaining only the sound 
leaves. Cook in boiling, salted water for ten or fifteen minutes; 
drain in a colander, pouring cold water over them. Chop and re- 
heat with butter and seasoning or with cream sauce. 

BEET GREENS 

Beets are usually thickly sowed, and as the young plants begin 
to grow they must be thinned out. These plants make delicious 
greens, and even the tops of the ordinary market beets are good if 
properly prepared. Examine the leaves carefully to be sure that 
there are no insects on them; wash thoroughly in several waters, 
and put over the fire in a large kettle of boiling water. Add a 
teaspoon of salt for every two quarts of greens ; boil rapidly about 
thirty minutes or until tender; drain off the water; chop well and 
season with butter and salt. 

SPINACH 

Perhaps no other vegetable requires such care in the preparation 
as spinach. In the first place it takes a great deal of time, water 
and patience to wash it clean. Cut off the roots; break the leaves 

162

Family of Four V iiVril/ 1 ADLrJbd 

apart; drop them in a large pan of water; rinse well; lift them out 
separately and drop back into a second pan of water. Continue 
washing in fresh waters until there is not a grain of sand to be 
found in the bottom of the pan. Drain the spinach and drop it 
into boiling water, allowing three quarts of water and one table- 
spoon of salt to a half peck of spinach. Let it boil for twenty 
minutes or more, counting from the time it begins to boil, and 
drawing the cover of the saucepan to one side to allow the steam 
to escape. Empty into a colander; pour cold water over the 
spinach; drain and mince fine. Return to the fire with seasoning 
and butter, or drippings from roast beef or chicken if preferred. 
Garnish with hard-boiled egg or serve with cream sauce. 

DANDELIONS 

Gather young dandelion plants before they have flowered; cut 
off the roots; wash thoroughly; boil in salted water about one hour, 
leaving the lid partly off. Drain and chop fine; season with salt, 
pepper or vinegar, and a liberal measure of butter. 

If cooked with half spinach or beet greens it is less bitter and 
more palatable to some people. In this case the dandelion should 
be partly cooked before the other vegetable is added. 

LEEKS 

Wash and trim the leeks and cook them in boiling salted water 
until soft. Drain thoroughly; season with butter, salt and pepper, 
and serve. 

JERUSALEM ARTICHOKES 

1 quart peeled and cut artichokes 1 tablespoon butter 
1 pint niilk 1 tablespoon flour 

1 small onion 1 teaspoon salt 

y^ teaspoon pepper 

Wash and peel the artichokes and cut them into small cubes; 
put in a double boiler; cover with milk; add the onion and cook

French salad dressing. 

GREEN PEAS 

Shell the peas and cover them generously with water; bring to 
a boil; then push aside until the water will just bubble gently. 
Keep the lid partly off. When the peas are tender add salt and 
butter; cook ten minutes longer and serve. If the peas are not 
the sweet variety, add a teaspoon of sugar. 

SUGAR PEAS 

Sugar peas may be cooked in the pods like string beans. Gather 
the pods while the seeds are still very small ; string like beans and 
cut into pieces. Cover with boiling water and boil gently for 
twenty -five or thirty minutes or until tender. Pour off most of the 
water, saving it for soup; season the rest with salt and butter and 
serve. 

STRING BEANS 

Remove the strings carefully; break the pods into one-inch 
pieces ; wash thoroughly ; drain and drop into boiling salted water. 
Boil until tender; drain off the water; season with butter and 
more salt if needed and serve. 

Pork may be boiled with the beans if desired. Boil a quarter 
of a pound for five hours ; then add the beans. 

GREEN LIMA BEANS 
Cover the shelled beans with boiling water; bring to a boil 
quickly; then let them simmer slowly until tender. Drain and 
add salt, pepper and butter or hot cream or cream sauce.

PARSNIPS 

Wash the parsnips clean; boil them until tender; scrape off the 
skin and slice them into a vegetable dish, seasoning with salt, 
pepper and butter or pouring drawn butter over them. 

If preferred, the cooked parsnips may be chopped rather coarse, 
seasoned and returned to the fire with milk suflacient to cover them. 
Thicken with a teaspoon of flour rubbed in a tablespoon of butter; 
simmer for ten minutes and serve. 

Still another method of serving the parsnips is to fry the slices 
in butter after they have been boiled. 



KOHL-RABI 

Kohl-rabi or kale turnip is a cultivated variety of kale or cab- 
bage, distinguished by the swelling of the stem in turnip form. 
This swollen portion is used for food, cooked like turnips or un- 
cooked in slices like radishes. 



SALSIFY 

6 large roots 1 teaspoon salt

with the seasonings and butter. Cut off the stem end of each 
pepper; carefully remove the interior and fill the peppers with the 
prepared dressing. Place in a shallow baking pan and pour 
around them the v/hite sauce thinned with the stock or water. 
Bake about one hour, basting frequently with the sauce. 

Peppers may also be filled with a well-seasoned dressing of 
chopped meat, with or without the addition of bread crumbs or 
boiled rice. 

FRIED EGGPLANT 

Cut the eggplant in slices about a quarter of an inch thick; pare 
them; sprinkle with salt and pile one upon another, placing over

heat; return to the shell and score the dome-shaped surface with a 
knife. Place the squash on a plate with a doily beneath it and 
serve. 

CORN ON THE COB 

Free the corn from husks and silk; have a kettle of water boiling 
hard; drop the corn into it and cook ten minutes (or longer if the 
corn is not young). If a very large number of ears are put into 
the water they will so reduce the temperature that a longer time 
will be needed. In no case, however, should the corn be left too 
long in the water, as overcooking spoils the delicate flavor. 

CORN OFF THE COB 

Corn is frequently cut from the cob a-fter it is cooked and served 
in milk or butter; but by this method milch of the flavor and juice 
of the corn itself is wasted. It is better to cut the corn from the 
cob before cooking. With a sharp loiife cut oft' the grains, not 
cutting closely enough to remove any of the woody portion of the

skins. Then with a knife press out all the pulp and milk remaining 
in the cob; add this to the corn; season Vv^ell with salt, pepper and 
butter; add a little more milk if the corn is dry; cook, preferably 
in the oven, for about ten minutes, stirring occasionally. If the 
oven is not hot, cook over the fire.

of skin from the center of the potato and small pieces from the 

ends. If the potatoes are to be peeled, use a very sharp knife and 

remove as thin a layer as possible. If the potatoes are very young, 

the skins may be scraped off. Let the potatoes boil fifteen minutes ; 

then add a tablespoon of salt for every dozen potatoes; boil until 

tender and remove immediately from the water so that they will

Hash may be made with one or many vegetables and with or 
without the addition of meat and fish. Potato is the most useful 
vegetable for hash, because it combines well with meat or other 
vegetables. The vegetables must be chopped fine, well seasoned

Put the timbale iron in a kettle of hot fat for about twenty 
minutes. Take the bowl of batter in the left hand and hold it 
near the kettle of hot fat; with the right hand lift the iron from 
the fat; wipe it on soft paper; dip it into the batter, coating the 
iron to within three quarters of an inch from the top, allow the 
batter to dry and then dip it in the hot fat, holding the iron a 
little sidewise until it is in the fat; then turn perpendicularly and 
cook until the batter is a delicate brown. Take the iron out 
the same way it was put in, being very careful not to drop the 
timbale into the fat; drain the grease off and lay timbale on paper 
to drain. Wipe the drops of grease from the iron with a soft 
paper every time it is used. Fill the timbales with creamed fish, 
oysters, chicken or sweetbreads. 



TIMBALE OF MACARONI 

Boil macaroni as usual in salted water; rinse in cold water and 
cut into pieces a third of an inch long. Line a mold with these, 
spreading the bottom and sides thickly with butter first and setting 
the open ends of the macaroni against the butter. Spread over 
the macaroni a forcemeat suitable to whatever is to constitute the 
filling of the timbale; then fill up the mold with highly seasoned 
fish, game, poultry or oysters. Moisten with sauce; cover with 
more forcemeat, pinching the edges well together so that the 
sauce will not break through in cooling. Set the mold in a pan of 
hot water; cover with buttered paper and bake in a moderate 
oven for half an hour.

CHICKEN A LA KING 



1 cup chicken (white meat) 2 chopped pimolas 

2 tablespoons butter 1 wineglass sherry 
Salt and pepper 2 egg yolks 

1 cup cream 

Heat the chicken in the butter; season; add the pimolas and 
sherry; cook for five minutes; then add the eggs, well beaten in 
the cream. Stir until the mixture thickens slightly; serve at 
once or it will curdle. Serve on small squares of toast or in patty 
shells. 

CHICKEN A LA CRANE 

1 cup cold chicken 1 cup boiled mushrooms 

1 cup cream sauce 

Cut the chicken into small cubes; add the mushrooms, quar- 
tered; stir all into the cream sauce; heat thoroughly and serve 
in patty shells or patty cups. 



CHICKEN PATTIES 

2 cups cold chicken Grated nutmeg 

1 cup cream sauce 

Cut the chicken into small cubes; add a little grated nutmeg; 
stir into the cream sauce; heat thoroughly and serve in patty 
shells or patty cups. 

MEAT PATTIES 

Meat patties of various kinds may be made according to the 
recipe for chicken patties.

PATTY SHELLS 

Follow the directions for making puff-paste. One half pound 
of flour will make about six patty shells. 

Roll the paste to a thickness of one fourth inch; stamp out 
with a large round cutter and cut the centers from half of the 
rounds. Lay the rings thus made on the whole rounds, pressing 
them down so that they will stick together. In cold weather 
it may be necessary to wet the top of the large rounds near the 
edge to make sure that the rings will not slip. If deeper patty 
shells are wished two or three rings may be placed on top of the 
rounds instead of one. 

Have the oven as hot as for baking white bread. The shells 
should rise in ten minutes and then take twenty minutes longer 
to bake through and brown. There will usually be a little soft 
dough left in the center. This should be carefully removed 
with a fork. 

VOL-AU-VENT 

Roll puff -paste one half inch thick and from it cut out two large 
ovals, using a sharp knife first dipped in flour. Place it on a shal- 
low baking tin; cut a smaller oval from the second piece and lay 
the ring on the first, moistening slightly so that the two will stick 
together when baked. Roll out the piece cut from the second 
oval until it is the size of the others and bake in a separate pan as 
a cover for the vol-au-vent. Bake in a hot oven, covering with 
paper after the first fifteen minutes. It will require three quarters 
of an hour or longer; and unless baked thoroughly the crust will 
fall in cooling. When ready to use, reheat and fill with creamed 
oysters or game; or for dessert fill with sugared fruit and serve 
with whipped cream.

beaten egg; roll in bread crumbs; put in a wire frying-basket and 
lower into boiling hot fat. Test the fat by lowering a piece of 
stale bread into it; if the bread browns in thirty seconds the 
fat is sufficiently hot. Fry the croquettes a light brown; drain 
over the fat; lay on brown paper in a warm place for a few minutes 
and serve. 

MEAT CROQUETTES 

Veal, mutton, lamb, beef and turkey croquettes may be prepared 
in the same way as chicken croquettes. The secrets of success 
are to have the croquettes well coated with egg and crumbs and 
the fat sufficiently hot. Olive oil, cottolene, suetine, lard, or a 
mixture of any of these with drippings will serve the purpose; 
but olive oil is best. 

SALMI OF GAME

SALADS 



SALADS 

SALADS are seldom diflBcult of preparation and the resourceful 
housewife will find ever- widening possibilities. The salad, 
too, may in one sense be regarded as an economic provision in 
the menu, for in no other way can so many * 'left-overs " be attract- 
ively presented upon the table. For this reason, no doubt, some 
one has suggested that the salad must have originated in New 
England, the time-honored source of all the economies. 

The thing of chief importance in making salads is to have 
everything crisp and cold both at the time of making and the 
time of serving. Greens should be carefully washed in cold 
water always, and if not especially fresh should be allowed to 
stand in water for several hours. After removing them, dry by 
a vigorous swinging in a wire basket or by pressing them lightly 
between a clean folded towel or napkin. The dressing should 
not be added until the moment of serving, and the salad should 
be kept upon the ice as long as possible. 

Recipes for several kinds of dressing are here given. Mayon- 
naise is perhaps more generally used than any; but many per- 
sons dislike the taste of olive oil and prefer a cooked salad dressing. 
Lettuce and other leaf salads are usually considered better served 
with French dressing, and the latter is more delicate than any 
other dressing and therefore better adapted to some combinations. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Yolk of 1 egg 1/2 teaspoon salt 

1 cup oil Dash of red pepper 

2 teaspoons vinegar or lemon juice 1/2 teaspoon mustard 

Beat the egg in a cold dish with a silver or wooden fork. If 
the weather is very w^arm, place the dish in a larger vessel filled 
with chopped ice. When the egg is beaten add the seasoning and 

193 



C: A T A n Ci Planned for a 

^ALiAUO Family of Four 

the oil, drop by drop, being careful to beat well without reversing 
the motion for fear of curdling. When the dressing thickens begin 
adding the vinegar drop by drop. Then add more olive oil, then 
more acid, continuing until all are consumed. Be sure to have all 
the ingredients and dishes as cold as possible. 

If the mixture should curdle, begin immediately with a fresh 
egg in a fresh dish, and when it is well beaten add carefully the 
curdled mixture, drop by drop. 

COLORED MAYONNAISE 

To color Mayonnaise green add one tablespoon of ravigote herbs 
to the finished dressing; or chop parsley leaves very fine; pound 
them in a small quantity of lemon juice; strain and add the juice 
to the dressing. 

To color Mayonnaise red rub one scant tablespoon of lobster 
coral through a fine sieve and add it to the dressing. 

WHITE MAYONNAISE 

To make white Mayonnaise follow the ordinary directions, 
using lemon juice instead of vinegar, omitting the mustard and 
adding, when finished, a half cup of whipped cream or half an egg 
white beaten very stiff. 

COOKED DRESSING (MOCK MAYONNAISE) 

2 teaspoons mustard 1 egg 

2 teaspoons sugar 1 cup milk 

1 teaspoon flour 1 tablespoon vinegar 
Yz teaspoon salt 

Let the milk come to a boil; add the egg into which the mustard 
and sugar and flour have been well beaten. Stir over the fire 
until the mixture thickens; add the vinegar; take from the fire 
and add the salt. This may be used in place of Mayonnaise dress- 
ing by those who do not care for oil. 

CREAM DRESSING 

1 cup cream 1 tablespoon vinegar 

1 tablespoon sugar i^ teaspoon salt 

Dash of red pepper 

Mix the sugar, vinegar, salt and pepper thoroughly together; 
then add the cream gradually.

FRENCH DRESSING 

2 tablespoons vinegar 1 teaspoon salt 

6 tablespoons olive oil 1/2 teaspoon paprika 

Put the salt and paprika in a bowl ; add a little oil and beat well ; 
then gradually add the remainder of the oil, stirring constantly. 
Last of all stir in the vinegar, drop by drop. 

SALAD DRESSING IN LARGE QUANTITY 

3 eggs 1 teaspoon mustard 
3 tablespoons flour V2 cup vinegar 

IV2 cups cold water 3 egg yolks 

Red and black pepper 1 cup olive oil 

Salt 

Beat the three whole eggs ; add the mustard and flour well mixed 
with the water and a little red and black pepper. Put the vinegar 
on to boil and while boiling add the egg and mustard mixture, 
stirring constantly until it thickens. When cold add a Mayonnaise 
made of the three egg yolks and olive oil. Add salt after all is 
finished. 

This makes about a quart and is useful for chicken salad or for 
any purpose where a large quantity of dressing is needed. In 
winter it will keep a week or more. 

CHICKEN SALAD 

1 cup cold cooked chicken Mayonnaise dressing

PUDDINGS AND DESSERTS 

THE dessert is by no means an unimportant part of the meal; 
for, though frequently heavy and indigestible, it may be both 
dainty and wholesome. Custards and all milk desserts are to be 
recommended, especially in families where there are children. 
Many persons will take eggs and milk in this form when they 
would reject them in any other. 

Care should be taken in planning the menu to have a dessert 
that "goes well" with the other courses. It is a mistake to offer 
mince pie or plum pudding after a heavy turkey dinner, as is so 
frequently done; a light dessert would be much more acceptable. 

RICE PUDDING 

2 quarts milk % cup rice 

y^ teaspoon salt % cup sugar 

Grated nutmeg or cinnamon 

Wash the rice; mix with half the milk and the salt and sugar 
and pour into a buttered pudding dish. Bake for several hours in a 
slow oven, stirring frequently and adding the rest of the milk. 
When the last milk is added, grate nutmeg over the top and let 
the pudding brown. 

A cup of seeded or seedless raisins may be baked in the pudding 
if desired. 

BOILED CUSTARD 

2 cups hot milk 2 tablespoons sugar 

Pinch of salt 2 eggs or yolks of 3 eggs 

Vz teaspoon vanilla 

Put the milk on to heat in a double boiler. Beat the eggs thor- 
oughly with the sugar; into them pour the hot milk, stirring to 
prevent lumps. Return all to the double boiler and cook until 
the custard coats the spoon, but no longer. If the mixture should 
curdle, set the boiler in a pan of cold water and beat with a wire

egg-beater until smooth. When the steam passes off add the 
vanilla or other flavoring. 

In the winter, when eggs are expensive, the custard may be made 
with one egg and one heaping teaspoon of cornstarch dissolved in 
a little cold milk. 

If desired, the whites of the eggs may be beaten separately and 
added to the custard after it is cold or beaten with sugar into a 
meringue. 

RICE MERINGUE No. 1 

34 cup rice Yolks of 4 eggs 

Vi pound butter Little grated lemon rind 

1/2 cup powdered sugar Whites of 4 eggs 

1 quart milk 4 tablespoons granulated sugar 

Juice of 1 lemon 

Boil the rice in water; while hot add the butter; when cool add 
the sugar, milk, beaten yolks and lemon. Pour into a buttered 
pudding dish and cover with a meringue made of the whites of 
eggs and granulated sugar, flavored with lemon juice. Brown in a 
hot oven. 

RICE MERINGUE No. 2 

2 tablespoons rice Pinch of salt 

1 quart milk Lemon or vanilla flavoring 

Yolks of 2 eggs Whites of 2 eggs

Cook the rice in a little water; drain and add the yolks, sugar, 
salt and flavoring. Cover with meringue and brown in the oven. 



CORNSTARCH PUDDING 

3 cups scalded milk 1/3 cup sugar 

6 level tablespoons cornstarch ^4 teaspoon salt 

14 cup cold milk 2 eggs 

1 teaspoon vanilla 

Mix the cornstarch with the cold milk; stir the scalded milk 
slowly into this mixture and stir over hot water until the cornstarch 
thickens. Beat the eggs slightly; add sugar and salt; pour over 
them the cornstarch mixture and cook one minute longer. Serve 
cold with cream and sugar.

FROZEN DESSERTS 



FROZEN DESSERTS 

FROZEN desserts are refreshing and wholesome and require 
less time in preparation than the ordinary pudding. Success, 
moreover, is assured if a few very simple directions are followed. 

The essentials are to have the ice finely crushed and to use 
the right proportion of coarse rock salt. The finer the ice is 
crushed the quicker it melts, so for this reason it is important to [^ 

have the ice broken into very small pieces. Enough should be 
broken for the entire freezing, as the process of turning the crank 
should not be interrupted. 

The can should be completely surrounded and covered with a 
mixture of ice and salt, using three parts ice to one of salt. Let 
it stand for a minute or two until the mixture begins to freeze to 
the inside of the can. Then turn the crank continuously until 
the mixture seems hard and heavy to move; then take out the 
dasher, scrape the frozen dessert from the sides of the can and 
pack it down closely. Put a cork in the opening of the cover, 
fill up the bucket with ice and salt, cover with burlap or piece 
of carpet and let stand an hour or more to ripen. 

Do not draw off any of the water until the freezing is completed, 
but add ice and salt as necessary. The melted water helps to 
freeze the mixture in the can and need not be drawn off at all if 
the dessert is to be served within an hour. 

The mixture should be prepared several hours before freezing 
and allowed to stand in the refrigerator until thoroughly chilled. 
Can and dasher should be scalded before using. 

To crush the ice use an ice-crusher or a wooden mallet. Put 
the ice in a bag of burlap or canvas and pound into fine pieces. 
When the dessert is served, drain the salt that is in the can and 
save to use again.

BREAD, HOT CAKES, ETC

BREAD-MAKING 

BREAD holds an important place in the diet of every normal 
person, and as home-made bread is infinitely more palatable 
and more nutritious than baker's bread it is worth while to spend 
some time and effort in its preparation. 

The three essentials in bread-making are flour, yeast and liquid. 
The yeast plant grows best in a temperature of 86° F. Bread 
should therefore be set to rise in a warm place, free from drafts. 
On the other hand too great heat must be avoided, as it will kill 
the yeast plant and make the bread sour. Two risings are suf- 
ficient if the ingredients have been well mixed. Dough permitted 
to rise until too light will be full of holes; bread baked before it 
is suflficiently light will be heavy. 

The use of the patent bread-mixers is to be recommended, both 
because they save a great deal of labor and because they make 
for cleaner and better bread. 

Bread must be well covered while rising to prevent a crust from 
forming on the top of the dough. Several thicknesses of clean 
towels are best for this purpose if a covered bread-raiser is not 
used. The bread in the pans must also be covered until it is put 
in the oven 

Kneading 

To knead tne oread push the dough with the palm and draw it 
forward with the fingers. Use as little flour on the board as pos- 
sible as a soft dough makes better bread than a stiff dough. The 
more it is worked the finer will be the grain; but if a great deal of 
flour is worked in it will become hard. Knead until the dough is 
smooth and elastic to the touch: about twenty minutes is the 
usual time; about three minutes in the patent bread-mixer » 

253 



BREAD, HOT-CAKES, ETC. FamTolFJu? 

Baking 

Bread should be baked in a hot oven, but not in one that is too 
hot, as it should continue rising for the first fifteen minutes and if 
a hard crust is too quickly formed the rising is rendered diflficult. 
The crust may be buttered ten minutes before the bread is re- 
moved from the oven : this will make it softer and more palatable. 

The best pans for baking are made of Russia iron iand are four 
inches deep, four and a half wide, and ten long. The bread is done 
when it leaves the sides of the pan. The usual time allowed is 
fifty minutes. 

Biscuits require less time, but more heat. They should be baked 
in fifteen or twenty minutes.' 

YEAST 

Yeast is a mass of microscopic plants, the conditions of whose 
growth are moisture, warmth and sugar. Where the conditions 
are right these plants multiply very rapidly, giving off in the pro- 
cess alcohol and carbon-dioxide. When added to warm water and 
flour the plants feed upon the sugar in the flour and grow and 
spread throughout the dough. The carbon-dioxide causes bub- 
bles, making the dough "light." 

The strength of any yeast depends upon the care with which it 
is made and preserved. Ordinary liquid yeasts are apt to be full 
of bacteria which set up lactic or other fermentations and pro- 
duce an unpleasant flavor. Compressed yeast is on the whole 
much purer and much more uniform in strength. 

Compressed yeast is commercially made from grain in factories 
equipped with highly specialized and complicated machinery. The 
grains most used are corn, rye and barley malt. The grain is 
ground in a mill, mashed with water and the mash, cooked and al- 
lowed to cool, and finally fermented with yeast of a previous mak- 
ing. The result is the growth and multiplication of yeast cells. 

When the fermenting process has been carried to the proper 
stage, the yeast is separated from the fluid containing it, thoroughly 
washed with water, filtered, pressed, cut into cakes and wrapped. 
Every yeast cake contains millions of tiny yeast plants. 

This is the oldest and surest method of yeast-making. Many 
varieties of the method have been introduced, but it would take 
volumes to go into the details of the subject. Suffice it to say that 
the processes are extremely complicated and that the grea.test 
amount of care and regulation is required in order to produce the 
compressed yeast which goes into our daily bread.

CAKES 



CAKES 

CAKE baking, or rather the baking of good cakes, is an art 
perhaps, but not necessarily a difficult art. The essentials 
are to have good materials and to follow carefully the directions 
for mixing and baking. 

Mixing 

Accuracy in the proportion of ingredients is absolutely neces- 
sary. To insure it, instead of depending on ordinary cups and 
spoons, no two of which hold exactly the same quantity, it is 
well to have utensils of regulation size — a measuring cup divided 
into quarters and thirds, and holding half a pint, a few tea- and 
tablespoons, a case knife, and several mixing spoons. 

For the sake of convenience cakes may be divided into two 
main classes — sponge cakes, or cake without butter, and butter 
cakes. In the main, one method of mixing for cakes of one class 
is followed. 

To mix sponge cake: Separate the yolks of the eggs from the 
whites, and beat the yolks with an egg-beater until they are thick 
and lemon-colored. Then add the sugar a little at a time, beating 
constantly. Now beat the whites until they are stiff and dry; 
add them and the sifted dry ingredients as directed in the recipe. 
Do this with as few motions as possible, as otherwise the air bub- 
bles enclosed in the mixture will be broken and all previous work 
undone. 

To mix butter cake: Use an earthen bowl for mixing such cakes, 
and a wooden mixing spoon with slits in it, to lighten the labor 
of creaming and stirring. Measure the dry ingredients; mix 
with the flour and sift. Next break the eggs, dropping each 
into a saucer first in case the whole egg is to be used, so that if 
a stale egg happens to be among them it can be detected easily 
and in time. If the whites and yolks are to be used separately, 
divide them as you break the eggs, and beat both well before using 
— the yolks until light and the whites until stiff and dry.

CATT'TTO Planned for a

Then measure the butter, and if it is too hard to work well, 
let it stand in a warm place until it has become softened, but not 
melted. If there is not time for this, warm the bowl by pouring 
hot water into it, letting it stand a few minutes, then emptying 
and wiping it dry. Do not let it get too warm, however, or the 
butter will become oily instead of creamy. 

If fruit is to be used, wash and dry it the day before. Dust 
with flour just before using, and mix with the hand till each 
piece is powdered, so that all will mix evenly with the dough 
instead of sinking to the bottom. 

Be sure to have all the ingredients ready before beginning to 
mix. Put the butter into the bowl; work it until soft and creamy, 
and gradually add the sugar, beating constantly. Next add the 
eggs, or the yolks, whichever the recipe specifies, and then the 
liquid. Work in the flour, a little at a time; or, if desired, add 
small quantities of flour and liquid alternately until the entire 
amount of each has been used. 



Baking 

Grease the pans carefully with butter or suet; dust lightly 
with flour; shake out the flour and pour in the batter. Then 
lift the pans into the oven. 

The essential point, of course, is that the oven have just the 
proper degree of heat for the kind of cake to be baked. If it is 
too hot at first, the cake will form a crust on the outside before 
rising to its full height, and in continuing to rise it will lift the 
top and break it, thus producing an unsightly loaf. If it is too 
cool, the cake will either fall, or rise and run over the sides of the 
pan, making the loaf not only unsightly, but of a coarse texture. 

Cake should be watched while baking. If the oven door is 
opened and closed carefully there is no danger of causing the 
cake to fall. If the cake browns too quickly, cover it with paper 
and reduce the heat. Small cakes require a hotter oven than 
loaf cake. 

All cakes except pound cake shrink away from the edges of the 
pan when done, and in most cases no further test is necessary. 
Cakes may, however, be tested by sticking a fresh broom straw 
into the center; if it comes out clean the cake is done. 

If the cake cracks open on top too much flour has been used. 
If of coarse texture the cake has not been well beaten or the oven 
has been too slow.

HOW TO DECORATE A CAKE 



PASTRY AND PIES 

THE American fondness for pie has become a byword, anc 
rightly perhaps, considering the indigestibility of pastry, 
even at its best; yet every good cook prides herself upon the 
quality of her products in this particular field. Much, too, de- 
pends upon the way she does her work; for pastry may be light, 
flaky, and fairly digestible, or it may be heavy, soggy and incapa- 
ble of digestion even by the most healthy person. 

The baking is especially important, because even good crust 
poorly baked is unfit to eat. The oven must be hot, with the 
greatest heat at the bottom, so that the under crust may ha 
thoroughly cooked, and cooked before the filling of the pie has 
a chance to soak in and make it soggy. 

Butter makes a more digestible crust than lard, and although 
the recipes call for lard because that is more generally available, 
some other preparation is to be preferred. There are several 
on the market. 

PUFF-PASTE 

V^ pound butter V2 teaspoon salt 

14 pound flour V4 to 1/2 cup ice-water 

The secret of making good puff-paste is to have all the ingredients 
cold. Use a marble slab if possible and avoid making the paste 
on a warm, damp day. It should be made in a cool place, as 
it is necessary to keep the paste cold during the whole time of 
preparation. The recipe makes two pies or four crusts. 

Cut off one third of the butter and put the remaining two thirds 
in a bowl of ice- water. Divide this into four equal parts; pat 
each into a thin sheet and set them away on ice. Mix and sift the 
flour and salt; rub the reserved butter into it and make as stiff 
as possible with ice-water.^ Dust the slab with flour; turn the 
J 317 



PASTRY AND PIES FJ^ydFJur 

paste upon it; knead for one minute; then stand on ice for five 
piinutes. Roll the cold paste into a rectangular sheet about one 
third of an inch thick; place the cold butter in the center and fold 
the paste over it, first from the sides and then the ends, keeping 
the shape square and folding so that the butter is completely 
encased and cannot escape through any cracks as it is rolled. Roll 
put to one fourth inch thickness, keeping the rectangular shape and 
folding as before, but without butter. Continue rolling and fold- 
ing, enclosing a sheet of butter at every alternate folding until all 
four sheets are used. Then turn the folded side down and roll in 
one direction into a long narrow strip, keeping the edges as straight 
as possible. Fold the paste over, making three even layers. Then 
joU again and fold as before. Repeat the process until the dough 
lias had six turns. Cut into the desired shapes and place on the 
iceJor twenty minutes or longer before putting in the oven. 

If during the making the paste sticks to the board or pin, 
remove it immediately and stand on the ice until thoroughly 
hilled. Scrape the board clean; rub with a dry cloth and dust 
*ath fresh flour before trying again. Use as little flour as possible 
n rolling, but use enough to keep the paste dry. Roll with a 
ight, even, long stroke in every direction, but never work the 
rolling pin back and forth as that movement toughens the paste 
and breaks the bubbles of air. 

The baking of puff -paste is almost as important as the rolling, 
and the oven must be very hot, with the greatest heat at the 
bottom, so that the paste will rise before it browns. If the paste 
should begin to scorch, open the draughts at once and cool the 
temperature by placing a pan of ice-water in the oven. 



HALF PUFF-PASTE FOR FRUIT PIES 

V2 pound flour Ice-water 

2 ounces lard 4 ounces butter . 

Pinch of salt * 

Sift the flour and salt; cut into it the lard; mix to ^ dough with 
cold water. Flour the pastry slab or pie board; turn out the paste; 
roll half an inch thick; sprinkle lightly with flour and roll again, 
i^ay on the butter; fold the crust over; roll as before; dust with 
iiour; fold and roll again. Repeat the process once more; set 
in a cool place for half an hour or longer; give another roll and the 
aste is ready for use. It should make four single crusts.

Mixing the Dough Fluting the Crust Health Pie 




SyVf^Fo^ur PASTRY AND PIES 



PLAIN PASTE 

1 cup flour 1 tablespoon lard 

V2 teaspoon salt Ice-water 

Sift the flour and salt; rub in the lard with the finger tips as 
lightly as possible; then add water, preferably ice-water, drop 
by drop until a dough is formed. The amount of water will depend 
on the flour. Flour the bottom of the pan; roll out the crust 
and line the bottom of the pan with it. Trim oft' the edges; roll 
them out; form into a long strip and press around the edge of 
the crust, moistening it slightly with water first to make the 
dough adhere. Fill and bake in a quick oven, having the greatest 
heat at the bottom. A gas stove is more satisfactory for pies 
than a coal stove. The recipe makes two single crusts. 



TARTLETS 

Roll puff -paste one eighth of an inch thick; cut it into squares; 
turn the points together into the middle and press slightly to make 
them stay. Bake until thoroughly done; place a spoonful of 
jam in the center of each; cover the jam with meringue and brown 
the meringue in a quick oven. 

By brushing the top of the paste with beaten egg diluted with 
one teaspoon of water a glazed appearance may be obtained. 



TORTO FRUTAS 

Line the sides of a baking dish with a half puff-paste; cover the 
bottom with sliced pineapple; put in a layer of peeled sliced 
oranges, then sliced bananas and then a few slices of lemon; 
^sifting a generous supply of powdered sugar over each layer. 
Repeat the layers until the dish is full and cover with chopped nuts 
and narrow strips of the puff-paste. Bake slowly for an hour 
or more. 

PEACH CRUSTS 

Roll puff -paste one-eighth of an inch thick; cut in two-and-a- 
half-inch squares and bake in a hot oven. Cool; press down the 
centers and place in each a half of a canned peach, drained from 
its syrup. Sprinkle with powdered sugar and put brandy in each 
cavity.

again with Mayonnaise; put on the second slice of toast; press 
down and cut through the sandwich diagonally. Work as quickly 
as possible so that the toast and bacon may be hot when served. 

COMBINATION SANDWICH 

2 slices whole wheat bread 2 slices Swiss cheese 

2 slices cold boiled ham Butter 

Butter the bread. On one slice lay the slices of cold ham; then 
lay on the cheese; then the other slice of bread and press down 
firmly. Cut across diagonally and serve. 

CINNAMON TOAST 

Toast thin slices of bread to a deHcate brown; butter evenly 
and sprinkle with powdered sugar and cinnamon. Serve with 
afternoon tea. 

EGG TOAST 

1 egg 1 cup milk 

Vi teaspoon salt 4 slices bread 

Beat the egg thoroughly and add the salt and milk. Have the 
bread cut in thin shces; dip them in the milk, allowing each to 
absorb some. Brown in a buttered frying pan or on a griddle; 
butter and serve hot with sugar and cinnamon or with i yrup.

CHEESE STRAWS 

Roll out plain or puff-paste until one fourth of an inch thick. 
Spread one half with grated cheese; fold over and roll again. Re- 
peat the process three or four times; then cut into strips and bake. 
Serve with soup or salad. 

SALTED ALMONDS 

Pour boiling water on the almonds; cool and remove the skins; 
dry thoroughly and brown in a hot oven using a half tablespoon of 
butter or olive oil (preferably the oil) to each cup of nuts. When 
brown, sprinkle well with salt and spread on paper to dry and cool. 

A still easier way to prepare the nuts is to cook them over the 
fire, using a larger quantity of olive oil. As the oil can be saved 
and used again, this method is not necessarily extravagant. 

SALTED PEANUTS 

Shell and skin freshly roasted peanuts and proceed as in salting 
almonds.

CEREALS 



CEREALS 

CEREALS hold an important place in the diet, ranking first 
among vegetable foods. They are, moreover, easily pre- 
pared, are both palatable and digestible, and are easily preserved 
without deterioration. 

Variety is to be found both in using the different kinds of 
cereals and in preparing the common cereals in new ways. Most 
cereals are improved by the addition of a little milk during the 
latter part of the cooking, and most of them are also improved 
by the addition of chopped dates or whole sultana raisins. 

Thoroughness of cooking is a factor which has an important 
bearing upon digestibility; and it is unfortunate that cereals are 
so often served for breakfast and hurriedly prepared. They should 
wherever possible be cooked over night, and it is for this reason 
that the use of the fireless cooker is to be especially recommended. 

The ready-cooked foods are usually higher in price and not 
necessarily better. Where there is no fireless cooker, however, 
and where the saving of fuel is to be considered, they are not 
necessarily more expensive. 

In justice to the prepared foods it may be said that they are 
on the whole well cooked and palatable and usually reach the 
consumer in clean, fresh condition. They are also frequently 
more tempting to the jaded appetite. 

For cooking cereals by the fireless method see the chapter on 
"Fireless Cookery." 

OATMEAL PORRIDGE 

As oatmeal is ground in different grades of coarseness, the time 
for cooking varies and it is best to follow the directions given on 
the packages. The meal should be cooked until soft, but should 

[339 



r*T?"D17 A T Q Planned for a 

l^JlriVC/ill^O Family of Four 

not be mushy. Cook in a double boiler the required time. Keep 
covered until done; then remove the cover and let the moisture 
escape. 

OATMEAL WITH CHEESE 

1 cup oatmeal 1 teaspoon salt 

Water 1 tablespoon butter 

1 cup grated cheese 

Cook the oatmeal over night and just before serving add the 
butter and cheese. Stir until the cheese is melted and serve at 
once. 

BAKED APPLE WITH OATMEAL 

Pare and core the apples and fill the core space with left-over 
oatmeal mush. Put the apples in a baking dish; sprinkle with 
sugar; pour a little water into the bottom of the pan and bake in 
a moderate oven until the apples are tender. Serve warm with 
cream for breakfast or luncheon. 



WHEAT CEREALS 

Wheat cereals, like oatmeal, are best cooked by following the 
directions on the package. Most of them are greatly improved 
by the addition of a little milk or by |a few chopped dates or 
whole sultana raisins. 

CORN-MEAL MUSH 

1 cup corn meal 1 teaspoon salt 

1 cup cold water 1 pint boiling water 

Mix together the corn meal and salt and add the cold water 
gradually, stirring until smooth. Pour this mixture into the 
boiling water and cook in a double boiler from three to five hours. 
Serve hot with cream and sugar. 

FRIED MUSH 

Pour hot corn meal into a square dish that has been rinsed in 
cold water. When the mush is cold cut it into slices one half inch 
thick ; dust with flour and fry a delicate brown. Serve with syrup.

BOILED RICE 



V2 cup rice 2 quarts water 

1 tablespoon salt 

Put the rice in a strainer; place the strainer over a bowl nearly 
full of cold water; rub the rice; lift the strainer from the bowl and 
change the water. Repeat the process until the water in the bowl 
is clear. Have the two quarts of water boiling briskly; add the 
rice and salt gradually so as not to check the ebullition; boil 
twenty minutes or until soft; drain through a colander and place 
the colander over boiling water for ten minutes to steam. Every 
grain will be distinct and tender. 

If desired, the rice may be brought to a boil in a little milk 
instead of being steamed, though in this case the grains may not 
remain separate. 

Serve as a vegetable with butter and salt, or as a cereal with 
cream and sugar. 

RICE IN MILK 

IV^ cups hot milk y^ cup rice 

y^ teaspoon salt 

Clean the rice as for boiling in water; and cook with the milk 
and salt, adding a few seeded or sultana raisins if desired. Serve 
hot like boiled rice or press into small cups, cool and serve with 
cream and sugar. 

FARINA 

3 tablespoons farina 1 pint boiling water 

V^ teaspoon salt 

Cook the mixture in a double boiler for about one hour. 

HOMINY 

1 cup hominy 2 tablespoons butter 

2 quarts water 1 teaspoon salt 

2 tablespoons cream 

Get the unbroken hominy and after careful washing soak it 
twenty-four hours in the water. Cook slowly in the same water 
in a covered vessel for eight hours or until all the water has been 
absorbed by the hominy; add the butter, salt and cream and serve 
as a vegetable or as a cereal with sugar and cream.

CANDY 



CANDY 

CANDY may or may not be "good for one," but every girl 
and woman likes to make it, and the home-made candies 
are usually more wholesome than those that are bought. 

FONDANT 

2 cups granulated sugar 1 cup water 

V4 saltspoon cream of tartar 

Put the ingredients in a copper or granite saucepan; stir imtil 
the sugar is dissolved, but no longer. Boil until the mixture makes 
a very soft ball when dropped in cold water. After it has boiled 
a few minutes sugar will adhere to the sides of the kettle: this 
should be washed off as soon as it forms, with the hand first dipped 
in cold water. Pour the mixture slowly on an oiled marble slab or 
large platter; let it cool until pressure with the finger leaves a dent 
on the surface. If stirred while too warm or if cooked too long it 
will granulate and must be recooked, adding more water. When 
it will dent work the mass with a wooden spoon or spatula, keep- 
ing the mass in the center as much as possible. Continue to stir 
until creamy; then work with the hands until perfectly smooth. 
Put in a bowl; cover with oiled paper to exclude the air and let 
stand for twenty-four hours. 

Make into balls for cream chocolates and centers of walnut 
creams, date creams, etc., adding flavoring as desired. For cocoa- 
nut creams stir in grated or dried cocoanut. 



QUICK FONDANT 

White of 1 egg Confectioners* sugar 

Flavoring 

Beat the egg very stiff; stir in as much confectioners* sugar as 
the egg will hold; flavor and mold into small balls.

FRUIT 



FRUIT 

FROM those who advocate a diet of only fruit and nuts to 
those who take time to enjoy three square meals a day, 
people are coming more and more to reahze the importance of 
fruit in the daily meal. In general it may be said that fruits 
are wholesome, palatable and attractive additions to the menu. 
Fresh fruits, of course, are largely composed of water; but dried 
fruits and many preserves are much more concentrated, com- 
paring favorably with cereals and dried vegetable foods. Fruits 
contain carbohydrates, considerable mineral matter and acid, 
and when eaten raw do much to stimulate a sluggish intestine. 

The methods of preparing include drying or evaporating, 
baking, boiling and stewing. Many fruits, too, are used in the 
preparation of puddings and other dishes and are made into 
jellies, preserves, beverages and ices. Even persons with delicate 
stomachs who find raw fruit indigestible can usually take it when 
properly prepared in some way. 

Several methods of preparing fruit for the table will be dis- 
cussed in this chapter and others will be found in the chapters 
on "Appetizers," "Puddings and Desserts,'* "Salads'* and 
"Canning and Preserving." 

BAKED APPLES 

Wash and core and if desired pare the apples. Place them in 
a shallow baking dish and fill the cavities with sugar, sugar and 
spice, sugar and seeded raisins, or sugar and chopped nuts. 
Sprinkle sugar and cinnamon over the apples; cover the bottom 
of the pan with water and bake about thirty minutes or until 
tender. Serve with cream or with lemon or wine sauce. 

APPLE SAUCE 

See chapter on "Sauces."

FRIED APPLES 

Cut slices a half inch thick across the apple, removing neither 
skin nor core; or cut the apples in quarters, removing both skin 
and core. Saute them in butter or drippings until tender; serve 
with crisp bacon. 

STEWED PEACHES 

Pare and quarter the peaches, discarding the stones. Bring 
to the boiling point one cup of sugar and one cup of water; cook 
four minutes; add the peaches and cook until tender. 

Pears," plums and apricots may be cooked in the same way, 
though the plums may require more sugar. 

BAKED PEACHES 

Plunge the peaches into boiling water to loosen the skins. 
Remove the skins; cut the peaches in half, discarding the stones, 
and lay them, cut side up, in a shallow baking dish. Fill the 
cavities with butter and sugar, a few drops of lemon juice and a 
sprinkling of cinnamon or nutmeg. Bake twenty minutes and 
serve on buttered toast or crackers. 

BAKED PEARS 

Wash the pears, and unless they are small quarter and core 
them. Place them in a deep pudding dish, well sprinkled with 
sugar. Add water sufficient to keep them from burning; cover 
and bake for two or three hours in a slow oven. If desired, a 
piece of stick cinnamon may be put in the pan with the pears; 
this will improve the flavor, 

BAKED QUINCES 

Wash, quarter, core and pare the quinces. Place them, cut 
side up, in a shallow baking dish, filling the cavities with sugar, 
mixed with a little grated lemon rind or lemon juice. Cover 
the bottom of the dish with water and bake in a moderate oven 
until soft, basting frequently. Serve hot with hjutter and sugar. 

STEWED QUINCES 

Wash the quinces, pare and core them and cut them into 
eighths. Cover with cold water and let them come slowly to a

boil, removing the scum that rises. Wlien nearly soft add one 
cup of sugar for every pint of fruit and one cup of apples, pared 
and cut into eighths. Boil until both apples and quinces are 
tender. 

STEWED RHUBARB 

Select the strawberry rhubarb in preference to the white; 
wash it, and unless it is very old, do not peel it. Simply remove 
the ends and cut the stalk into small pieces. Pour boiling water 
on the rhubarb; drain and put it in a saucepan over the fire, 
covering it well with sugar and adding only enough water to keep 
it from burning. Cook until soft but not until the pieces have 
lost their identity. The quantity of sugar will have to be varied 
according to the age of the rhubarb. 

STEWED BLACKBERRIES 

Wash and stem the blackberries; add a little water and stew 
until tender. Just before they are done sweeten to taste. 

Some cooks thicken the juice with a little cornstarch thinned in 
water. If this is done the blackberries must boil for an extra 
minute or two until the cornstarch is cooked. 

STEWED RASPBERRIES 

Follow the recipe for Stewed Blackberries. 

STEWED CHERRIES 

Select pie cherries, preferably the morello cherries; stone them 
or not as desired and follow the directions for Stewed Black- 
berries. 

STEWED CRANBERRIES 

See chapter on "Sauces." 

DRIED FRUITS 

To cook dried fruits thoroughly they should after careful wash- 
ing be soaked over night. Next morning put them over the fire 
in the water in which they have been soaked; bring to a boil; 
then simmer slowly until the fruit is thoroughly cooked but not 
broken. Sweeten to taste. Very much less sugar will be needed 
than for fresh fruit.

CANNING AND PRESERVING 



CANNING AND PRESERVING 

FRESH fruit is usually more palatable and refreshing than 
cooked fruit, but it is on the whole less digestible and, of 
course, not always obtainable. The importance of canning and 
preserving is therefore obvious. Canned goods of all sorts can 
be purchased, but they are usually inferior to the home-prepared 
foods and the price of the better ones is so high as to be almost 
prohibitive. 

Many housewives refuse to can and preserve because they 
always have "bad luck"; but "bad luck" in most cases means 
only bad management. If proper care is taken no harm can 
possibly befall the foods. 

In canning fruits there are several points to remember. First, 
the preserving kettle should be porcelain-lined, and no iron or 
tin utensils should be used, as the fruit acids attack these metals 
and so give a bad color and metallic taste to the food. Second, 
all fruits should, if possible, be freshly picked, and it is better 
to have them under-ripe than over-ripe, as the fermentative stage 
follows closely upon the perfectly ripe stage. Third, in canning 
fruits the product is more satisfactory if heated gradually to the 
boiling point and then cooked the given time. 

Scrupulous cleanliness and eternal vigilance are the price of 
success. The kitchen should be freshly swept and dusted so that 
there may be as few mold spores as possible floating in the air; 
the fruit should be carefully gone over and bruised or gnarled 
portions removed; and all jars and utensils should be thoroughly 
sterilized. Saucepans, spoons, jars, covers, straining bag, etc., 
should be put on the fire in cold water, heated gradually and 
boiled for ten or fifteen minutes. The jars must be taken one 
■4 365 ' 



CANNING AND PRESERVING Fa''i^?y°^ 'p'Ju'r 

at a time from the boiling water, and not until the moment each 
is to be filled. 

Never use old rubbers or lids that are bent and be sure that 
lids are boiled and rubbers dipped in boiling water one at a time 
just before using., 

Fruit must be carefully picked and washed, and all stems 
removed, and only as much as can be cooked while it still retains 
its color and crispness should be prepared. If practicable pare the 
fruit with a silver knife. Peaches, plums and tomatoes may be 
readily skinned after a three-minute plunge in boiling water. 
Where fruit like quinces and hard pears must be first boiled in 
clear water, the fruit should be dropped in cold water made slightly 
acid with lemon to keep the fruit from discoloring. 

When fruit is preserved with a large amount of sugar (a pound 
of sugar to a pound of fruit) it does not need to be sealed in air- 
tight jars; because bacteria do not readily form in the thick, 
sugary syrup. It is, however, best kept in small sealed jars, since 
molds are very likely to form. 

Under no circumstances should preserving powders be used. 
In most cases they are injurious, and in any case are the resort 
of the cook who is too lazy to take the proper precautions. 

CANNING FRUIT IN A WATER BATH 

Canned fruits may be cooked over the fire according to the 
recipes that follow; but they are, on the whole, very much better 
if cooked in a water bath. Prepare fruit and syrup as for cook- 
ing in a preserving kettle and cook the syrup ten minutes. Steril- 
ize the jars and utensils; fill the jars with fruit; then pour in 
enough syrup to fill the jars completely. Run the blade of a 
silver-pointed knife around the inside of the jar and put the covers 
on loosely. 

Have a wooden rack, slats, or straw in the bottom of a wash- 
boiler; put in enough warm water to come to about four inches 
above the rack; place the filled jars in the boiler, being careful 
not to let them touch. Pack clean white rags or cotton rope 
between and around the jars to prevent their striking one another 
when the water begins to boil. Cover the boiler and let the fruit

cook ten minutes from the time the surrounding water begins to 
boil. 

Draw the boiler aside and remove the cover. When the steam 
passes off, lift out one jar at a time and place it in a pan of boiling 
water beside the boiler; fill to overflowing with boiling syrup; 
wipe the rim of the jar with a cloth wrung from boiling water; 
put on rubbers and cover quickly; stand the jar upside down and 
protected from drafts, until cool; then tighten the covers if screw 
covers are used, and wipe off the jars with a wet cloth. Paste 
on labels and put the jars on shelves in a cool, dark closet. 

CANNING IN THE PRESERVING KETTLE 

Canning in the preserving kettle is less satisfactory; but is 
sometimes considered easier, especially for small fruits. Cook 
the fruit according to the directions and see that all jars, covers 
and utensils are carefully sterilized. When ready to put the fruit 
in the jars, put a broad skimmer under one, lift it and drain off 
the water. Set it in a shallow pan of boiling water or wrap it 
well in a heavy towel wrung out of boiling water; fill to over- 
flowing with the fruit and slip a silver-plated knife around the 
inside of the jar to make sure that fruit and juice are solidly 
packed. ''Wipe the rim of the jar; dip the rubber ring in boiling 
water, place it on the jar; cover and remove the jar, placing it 
upside down on a board, well out of drafts until cool. Then 
tighten the covers, if screw covers are used; wipe the jars with 
a wet cloth, and stand on shelves in a cool, dark closet. 

The success of canning depends upon absolute sterilization and 
not upon the amount of sugar or cooking. Any proportion of 
sugar may be used, or fruit may be canned without the addition 
of any sugar. Juicy fruits, such as berries and cherries, require 
little or no water. 

CANNED RASPBERRIES 
6 quarts berries 1 quart sugar 

Put one quart of the fruit in the preserving kettle; heat slowly, 
crushing with a wooden potato masher; strain and press through 
a fine sieve. Return the juice and pulp to the kettle; add the 
sugar; stir until dissolved; then add the remaining quarts of 
berries. Boil ten minutes, counting from the time they begin to 
boil. Skim well while boiling, and put into jars as directed.

Green gooseberries may also be canned like rhubarb without 
sugar and sweetened when used. 



CANNED PLUMS 

4 quarts plums 1 quart sugar 

1 cup water 

Wash, drain and prick the plums. Make a syrup of the sugar 
and water; put part of the fruit in the boiling syrup; cook five 
minutes; fill and seal the jars. Put more fruit in the syrup;

Pare the peaches, cutting them in half or not as desired. If 
in half leave one or two whole peaches for every jar, as the kernel 
improves the flavor. Put a layer of fruit in the kettle; when it 
begins to boil skim carefully; boil gently for ten minutes; put 
in jars and seal. Then cook more of the fruit in similar fashion. 
If the fruit is not fully ripe it may require a longer time to cook.

Boil the syrup and skim it; add the fruit and cook gently until 
tender. It will take from twenty to fifty minutes, according to 
the kind of apple. 

CANNED QUINCES 

2 quarts quinces 3 cups sugar 

1 quart water 

Wash and drain the quinces; pare, quarter and core them and 
drop the pieces into cold water to which a little lemon juice has 
been added. Put the fruit over the fire with cold water to cover 
it; heat slowly and simmer gently until the fruit is tender. With 
a silver fork remove each piece as soon as it is tender and drain 
them on a platter. Strain the water in which the fruit was cooked; 
put one quart of it in the kettle with the sugar; bring to a boil 
and skim. Add the cooked fruit and boil gently for about twenty 
minutes. 

CANNED PINEAPPLE 

Select ripe fruit; pare and remove the eyes; slice them in half- 
inch slices and cut each slice into quarters. Fill the jars with 
fruit, within an inch of the top. Make a cold syrup of sugar and 
water in the proportion of a cup of sugar to a pint of water; fill 
the jars with this up to the top and boil hard for three hours in 
a water bath. See directions for canning by this method on a 
previous page. 

CANNING VEGETABLES 

In canning vegetables the same precautions must be observed 
as in canning fruit and it is safer to use jars that have either glass 
or metal tops without porcelain lining. Corn should be pressed 
or cut from the cob and packed at once into jars. Stand the jars 
on a rack in a boiler; adjust the rubbers and lay the covers on, 
but do not fasten them. Pour water into the boiler until it 
reaches about four inches above the rack; cover the boiler and 

370 



gL'!Sny''of''F,ur CANNING AND PRESERVING 

boil continuously for four hours. Lift one jar at a time and fasten 
on the lid without removing it. When the jars are cold put them 
on a shelf in a cool, dark place. 

Peas may be canned in the same way, but each jar must be 
filled with water; string beans require cooking for only one hour 
and a half, but the jar manipulation is the same. 



CANNED TOMATOES 

Wash the tomatoes and plunge them in boiling water for five 
minutes. Pare and cut them into small pieces; put them in the 
preserving kettle over the fire and heat slowly, stirring frequently 
to prevent their sticking, and removing the scum that rises. Boil 
for thirty minutes, counting from the time the whole mass begins 
to boil. Put in sterilized jars and seal. 



CANNED MUSHROOMS 

Stem the mushrooms and wash them carefully, but do not 
peel them. Pack them closely in glass jars; adjust the rubbers 
and lay the lids on loosely. Stand the jars in a wash-boiler on 
a rack or straw and pour in water to come about four inches 
above the rack. Cover the boiler; bring the water to the boiling 
point and boil continuously for one hour and a half. By this 
time the mushrooms will have wilted down; so fill two jars by 
means of a third; cover them and put them back in the boiler. 
Boil for thirty minutes; fill the jars to overflowing with boiling 
water and quickly cover. 



PRESERVING FRUIT 

Some fruits, such as strawberries, sour cherries, sour plums, 
etc., are better preserved with a large amount of sugar than 
simply canned. They are richer, however, and cannot be eaten 
in such abundance as canned fruits. 

A thick coating of paraffin makes a good cover, but not quite 
so good as paper cut the proper size and dipped in alcohol or 
brandy, because the spirits destroy any mold spores that may 
happen to rest on the top. Paraffin poured on top of the paper, 
however, will help to insure preservation.

cook for about ten minutes, or until it begins to thicken. Add 
the berries; cook for ten minutes and pour them out in shallow 
dishes or meat platters. Cover with sheets of glass, allowing a 
little air for ventilation; place in the sun until the juice is thick 
and syrupy. This will take two days or more, but the rich color 
and delicious flavor of the fruit will fully repay the effort expended. 
Put into small jars or tumblers and cover according to directions. 

PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES 

1 pint strawberries 1 pint sugar 

V2 cup water 

Unless strawberries are cooked in the sun they should be pre- 
pared only in small quantities, or they will be dark and unpalat- 
able. If the following directions are carefully observed the straw- 
berries will be plump and of a rich red color. 

Bring the sugar and water to a boil; add the strawberries and

the consistency of marmalade. 

MARMALADES 

Marmalade may be made of almost any fruits. ,If berries are 
used, press them through a sieve to remove seeds; if large fruit,' 
pare, quarter and core it. Measure the fruit and sugar, allowing 
one pint of sugar to every quart of fruit. Rinse the preserving 
kettle in cold water; put in alternate layers of fruit and sugar, 
making the first layer of fruit. Heat slowly, stirring to prevent 
the fruit from sticking. Cook for about two hours; put in small 
sterilized jars.

APPLE BUTTER 

5 quarts apple pulp 1 teaspoon ground cloves 

10 quarts new sweet cider 1 teaspoon ground allspice 

Brown sugar 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon 

The apples should be tart and the cider not more than two 
days old. Boil the cider down one half before measuring; put 
the pared and cored apples through a fruit press; measure them 
and add to the cider. Cook slowly, stirring frequently, and when 
the butter begins to thicken sweeten to taste with brown sugar. 
Continue cooking until of the consistency of soft jam; pack while 
hot in sterilized jars or glasses and keep in a cool place. 

PEACH BUTTER 
4 pounds peaches 2 pounds sugar 

Select ripe peaches and peel and stone them before weighing. 
Cut them in pieces and put them through a fruit press. Put 
over the fire in a porcelain kettle and cook slowly until of the 
consistency of marmalade, stirring occasionally to prevent stick- 
ing. Add the sugar; stir until dissolved; cook rapidly for fifteen 
minutes, then place the kettle on the back part of the stove and 
keep warm until the butter is of the desired consistency. Pack 
in jars or tumblers. 

TUTTI-FRUTTI 

Put one pint of high-proof alcohol or brandy in a stone crock 
and add the various fruits as they come in season, using equal 
quantities of fruit and sugar and stirring until the sugar is dis- 
solved. Keep the jar covered but stir daily until all the fruit 
has been added. Pineapple, cherries, peaches, apricots, white 
grapes and the berries are the best fruits to use. 

JELLY-MAKING 

To be successful in jelly-making it is necessary to understand 
a few of the simple underlying principles. The making of jelly 
is possible through the presence in the fruit of pectin, a carbo- 
hydrate, somewhat similar in its properties to starch. This 
element exists in largest quantities in the following fruits: cur- 
rant, apple, quince, grape, blackberry and raspberry; so that 
these fruits are preferred for jelly-making. Moreover, the pec 

376 



I 



FLmS^Vf^Folr CANNING AND PRESERVING 

tin is at its best when the fruit is just ripe or a little under-ripe. 
Last, it must be remembered that if the juice ferments or if the 
cooking of the jelly is continued too long, the pectin undergoes a 
change and loses its power of gelatinizing. 

After insuring the presence of the pectin, the matter of next 
importance is to add the right quantity of sugar. The rule is to 
measure the juice and add an equal amount of sugar; but the 
rule must be followed with discretion. If the fruit contains an 
unusual percentage of sugar, less sugar should be added; if it 
is less sweet than usual, more should be added to make up the 
deficiency. The sugar will dissolve more quickly if first heated 
in a moderate oven, and will then in no way interfere with the 
cooking. 

Jelly should be put into glasses that have been thoroughly 
sterilized and covered according to the directions given under 
"Preserving Fruit." It should, however, stand twenty-four hours 
before being covered. If possible lay a sheet of glass over the 
tumblers and stand them in a simny window. 

APPLE JELLY 

Wash the apples; remove stem and blossom ends and cut into 
quarters. Put them in a preserving kettle, adding enough cold 
water to come nearly to the top of the apples. Cover and cook 
gently until the apples are soft and clear. Mash the apples and 
drain them through a sieve in which two thicknesses of cheese- 
cloth have been laid or through a jelly bag. Avoid squeezing the 
bag or the jelly will be clouded. Boil twenty minutes and add 
the heated sugar, allowing two cups or one pound to every pint 
of juice. Boil five minutes; skim, and test by putting a teaspoon 
of juice in a cool saucer. If it jellies at once, remove from the 
fire and pour into sterilized glasses. 

QUINCE JELLY

Put them in the preserving kettle, crushing a few in the bottom

hot, mash them with a potato masher and let them drip the same 
as the apples, for apple jelly. After this put the cloth or bag 
over another dish and press out as much juice as possible, using 
this for a second cjuality of jelly. 

Return the clear juice to the kettle, adding a pint of granu- 
lated sugar to every pint of juice. Stir until the sugar is dis- 
solved; then place over the fire; bring to a boil; set aside and 
skim. Repeat this process three times; test the jelly by drop-

BEVERAGES 



BEVERAGES 

BEVERAGES may or may not be a necessary part of the 
ordinary meal; but to most people they are all but indis- 
pensable. Coffee and tea, it is true, even in moderate quantities 
often have bad effects upon the digestion and the nerves. If 
properly made, however, even these beverages may be taken by 
almost any person without resultant harm. 

COFFEE 

5 tablespoons ground coffee 4 cups boiling water 
1 egg (or less) 1 cup cold water 

Use an aluminum or granite- ware pot and always make the coffee 
fresh, scalding the pot each time before using. 

Wash the egg; break and beat slightly. Add half the cold 
water; mix with the coffee; put in the pot and add the boiling 
water. Bring to aboil and boil for one minute; add the remainder 
of the cold water to assist the grounds in settling. Stand the pot 
where it will keep hot but not boil for five minutes ; then serve at 
once, as coffee allowed to stand becomes flat and loses its aroma. 

The egg is not necessary; but most cooks use a clean shell or a 
little of the white of an egg if they do not use the whole. Others 
beat the whole egg, with a little water, but use only a portion of it, 
keeping the rest for further use in a covered glass in the ice chest. 

INSTANTANEOUS COFFEE 

6 tablespoons pulverized coffee 6 cups boiling water 

A variety of pots are on the market for making instantaneous 
coffee, all containing a strainer to hold the coffee, which must be 
pulverized, not simply ground. Put the coffee in the strainer;

SERVING COFFEE 

Cream is usually served with coffee, but scalded milk renders 
the coffee more digestible than does cream. Fill the cup one 
fourth full of hot scalded milk; pour on the freshly-made coffee, 
adding sugar if desired. 

Whether cream or milk is used, it is better to pour the coffee on 
the cream or milk. 

After-dinner coffee should be made very strong and served black. 

COFFEE IN BULK 

1 pound ground coffee 9 quarts water 

1 egg 

Mix the coffee with the egg that has been thinned by a little 
water, and tie it into four muslin bags. Let these soak in the 
water for three or four hours; bring to a boil and serve. 

This amount will serve fifty persons. 

TEA 

2 teaspoons tea 4 cups boiling water 

Use an earthen or china teapot and have water freshly boiled. 
Scald out the teapot; put in the tea and pour on the boiling water. 
Let stand in a warm place for five minutes ; pour off and serve. 

Never let the tea boil; never let it stand a long time on the 
leaves; and never make more by adding fresh leaves to the old. 



RUSSIAN TEA 

Make the tea as usual. Serve with thin slices of lemon from 
which the seeds have been removed. 

TEA PUNCH 

1 quart tea Juice of 6 lemons 

1 pound sugar Juice of 2 oranges 

1 lemon sliced

FRUIT DRINKS 

The success of lemon-, orange- and pineapple-ade depends in large 
degree upon the way they are made. It is best to make a syrup as 
for sherbets, using one cup of granulated sugar to one cup of water. 
Put the sugar in cold water over the fire; stir until the sugar is 
dissolved; then cook until the syrup spins a fine thread. Take 
from the fire and add the fruit juices while the syrup is hot. If 
lemonade is desired, lemon should predominate, but orange or 
pineapple juice or both should be added to yield the best result. 
Small pieces of fresh pineapple, fresh strawberries and maraschino 
cherries added at time of ser\'ing will make the drink look pretty 
and will improve the flavor. Shaved or very finely cracked ice 
should be used. 

QUICK LEMONADE 

2 lemons 1 quart water 

4 tablespoons sugar Cracked ice 

Wash the lemons and squeeze the juice; mix thoroughly with 
the sugar, and when the sugar is dissolved add the water and ice, 
and a little fresh fruit or slices of lemon if convenient. 

EGG LEMONADE 

2 lemons 4 tablespoons sugar 

2 eggs 3 cups water 

1 cup cracked ice 

Break the eggs and beat the whites and yolks separately. Mix 
the lemons, sugar, water and ice as for lemonade; add the eggs; 
pour rapidly back and forth from one pitcher to another and serve 
before the froth disappears. 

GRAPE JUICE 

10 pounds grapes 2 pounds sugar 

1 quart water 

Wash and stem the grapes; put them in a preserving kettle and 
crush sHghtly. Bring to a boil and cook gently for half an hour. 
Strain though cheesecloth or jelly bag, pressing out all the juice 
possible; return to the fire with the sugar; cook for fifteen minutes; 
strain again; reheat and pour into sterilized bottles, thorougjily 
heated. Put in sterilized corks and dip the neck of the bottle in 
hot sealing wax.

INVALID COOKERY 

COOKING for an invalid is by no means a difficult task; but 
care is necessary in order that the product may be as appeti- 
zing and as digestible as possible. The serving, too, is important: 
only the daintiest china and glass should be used in the sick room; 
for the patient is seldom hungry and needs to be "tempted" in 
every possible way.

FIRELESS COOKERY 



FIRELESS COOKERY 

THE fireless cooker is coming into general use in almost every 
household, and with good reason. Not only does it mean a 
tremendous saving of fuel and of energy on the part of the house- 
wife, but it produces better results with many dishes than are pos- 
sible with coal or gas. Cereals, for instance, w^hich require long 
slow heating and which it is almost impossible to cook properly 
on a gas stove, are delicious when prepared by the fireless method. 

Generally speaking, there are on the market two kinds of fireless 
cookers — the cookers, so called, and the calorics. In the former 
the food is always heated over a flame before placing it in the 
receptacle; in the latter sometimes only the radiators upon which 
the pans rest are heated. Baking is possible in the calorics but 
not in the others. 

The recipes given in this chapter are arranged for the cooker 
with radiators; but all of them, with the exception of those for 
roasting and baking, can be used for any cooker. Where there 
are no radiators, and where you are cooking things which require 
a great length of time, it is a good plan to remove the pail from the 
cooker when the time is half gone and reheat it over the fire. In 
doing so, as in preparing the dish for the cooker in the first place, 
the pail must not be uncovered before putting it in the cooker, or 
steam will escape and the food cool. 

The fireless cookers with radiators are by all means the best, 
and soon pay their own way by the saving of fuel; but where it is 
not possible to have one of these it is well worth while to have one 
of the simple cookers, which are less expensive and which can, with 
a little ingenuity, even be made at home. Procure a strong wooden 
box, well made, without cracks, and line it thoroughly with pads 
filled mth hay or excelsior and covered with denim or other thick 
27 413 - ' 



FIRELESS COOKERY Fe"T^fF°r, 

and closely woven material. Have a closely covered pail, prefer- 
ably a double pail of aluminum, to fit into the center and several 
pads of various sizes or a feather pillow to tuck over the top. The 
lid of the box should fasten down securely with a hasp. If care is 
taken to have the outside of the kettle clean and not to spill any 
of the contents, the pads will last for some time without renewing. 

With the cooker which has one pail within another, so that the 
upper one can rest in water, the process of steaming is more per- 
fect than where there is but one pail. It has also advantages 
where a great deal of cooking is to be done; for soup, for instance, 
may be cooking in the lower receptacle while vegetable, meat or 
pudding is in the upper. 

Certain precautions, it is true, must be observed by the cook 
who uses the fireless cooker. In the first place it should not be 
used for foods which require a rising temperature or those which 
require evaporation or those which might be injured by condensed 
steam. Then, too, it must be remembered that a dish left indefi- 
nitely in the cooker will sour. 

CEREALS 

To cook cereals in the cooker to best advantage there should be 
a double-boiler receptacle. Fill the large outer pail with water 
and bring it to a boil. In the upper vessel put the required amount 
of water; stir in the cereal; season to taste; heat and stir slowly 
until it begins to thicken — about ten minutes. Place the smaller 
kettle inside the larger and set away in the cooker; leave over- 
night and in the morning beat up well and reheat. If the grains 
are desired separate, cook a less time and do not beat. 

ARROWROOT GRUEL 

2 tablespoons arrowroot 1 teaspoon salt

Mix the arrowroot with just enough cold water to form a thin

used, and the true flavor and the nutriment of these things are 
best preserved by the fireless method of cooking.

Put in baking dish a layer of fish, then a layer of sauce, until full. 
Cover top with bread crumbs and bake in the cooker for one hour. 
Use two radiators. 

MEATS 

The more expensive meats are not necessarily the most nutri- 
tious. If the housewife thoroughly understands the right way to 
prepare cheaper meats, and has a fireless cooker, it is possible to 
have a tender and juicy piece of meat at comparatively small cost. 
Meats cooked by the fireless method do not lose in weight, be- 
cause nothing escapes, and there is no shrinkage from evaporation. 
It is a recognized fact that the tough meats can be reduced to 
delicious tenderness if steamed in a closed roaster for several 
hours. This is the principle of the fireless cooker. 

CORNED BEEF 

For cold corned beef the plate piece is best, while for hot the 
brisket is to be preferred. Always have a good layer of fat around 
it. Place in cold water and bring slowly to a boil and boil for 
thirty minutes, skimming well the first few minutes. Have cover 
tightly closed before removing to the cooker, and leave six or 
eight hours, using one radiator. Cool in stock; press between 
plates, and serve in thin slices. 

BOILED BEEF 

The brisket or piece of round is good for boiling. Place the suet 
and trimming of the meat in the kettle and fry out the fat. Then 
throw in the meat and sear quickly on all sides. Remove the 
cracklings from the fat and cover the meat with boiling water. 

422 



gL''^Syo^°L''ur FIRELESS COOKERY 

Without removing the cover place in the cooker and leave three 
hours or more. Use one radiator. Then place on a hot platter; 
salt well; garnish with cress or boiled cabbage. The liquor should 
be saved for stock and sauce. 

BEEF AU GRATIN 

Put in baking dish a layer of bread crumbs, then some thin 
slices of fat salt pork, slices of cold cooked beef, onion, parsley 
and another layer of crumbs, until the dish is full. Pour over all 
any left-over gravy or stock to moisten. Bake in the cooker for 
one hour. 

ROAST BEEF 

The best shaped roast to cook in the fireless is a rolled roast of 
five to eight pounds. Use whatever seasoning you are accustomed 
to and prepare in the usual way for the oven. Put the roast in 
the largest vessel, and if the roast is large, raise the temperature 
of the two radiators to the highest possible point; then place the 
vessel in the large compartment and allow it to remain on the 
program of twenty minutes for each pound of roast, or three 
minutes less per pound if the roast is desired rare. 

ROUND STEAK ON BISCUITS 

Cut round steak into small half-inch squares; cover with water 
and boil for five minutes. Remove at once to the fireless cooker 
and leave for five hours. Take out the meat; make a brown 
sauce of the juice; pour meat and sauce over split tea biscuits 
that have been baked with a hard crust.

CHICKEN PIE 

Place hot fricassee chicken and gravy in a baking dish. Make 
a rich crust and place on top of chicken. Place in cooker for one 
half hour. Use two radiators. 



ROAST CHICKEN 

The time necessary for roasting a chicken depends on the age of 
the bird. One hour and a half is suflScient for a young chicken, 
but an older one should be roasted two hours, and a very tough 
chicken three hours. If this course is followed, old chickens will 
turn out as tender and savory as spring chickens. Prepare the 
chicken in the usual method for the oven. It will not be necessary 
to heat the chicken to brown it before it has been placed in the 
cooker, for if both radiators have been made very hot the chicken 
when roasted will be nicely browned. It is not necessary to open 
the cooker for basting as the hot steam prevents burning. 

CHICKEN STEW 

Clean the chicken and cut it into small pieces. Heat the kettle 
and cover with water; allow to boil slowly for thirty minutes; 
season with pepper and salt, and place in cooker for six hours. 
Remove from cooker and add thickening. If desired, dumplings 
may be added and the kettle replaced in the cooker for thirty 
minutes.

MEAT RECIPES FOR THE HOME-MADE COOKER 

Any of the recipes for boiled meats or stew are, of course, suit- 
able for use with the ordinary box cooker. Those calling for the 
use of radiators are not. Meats that must be browned can be 
prepared in the cooker, however, if they are browned over a blaze 
either before or after they are placed in the cooker. 

Here are a few recipes : 

Roasted Meats 

Sear the roast over the fire, turning it constantly in a hot, dry 
pan; put in a very hot oven with two cups of water and bake 
twenty minutes. While this is being done, bring the water in the 
outer kettle to a boil; then place the roast over it; cover and boil 
hard for five or ten minutes; lift into the cooker and leave all day, 
reheating at noon and again at serving time. Lift the meat from 
the upper pan and make a brown sauce from the juice that re- 
mains. 

Stuffed Heart 

1 heart Savory drippings 

1 cup broken bread 1 chopped onion 

Salt and pepper 

Wash the heart thoroughly inside and out. Dip the bread- 
crumbs in fat; brown them in the oven; mix with chopped onion 
and season thoroughly. Stuff the heart with this mixture; sew 
up the opening and put it on to boil in water sufficient to cover. 
Boil for ten minutes and set in the fireless cooker for six or eight 
hours. Remove from the water half an hour before serving; 
sprinkle with flour, pepper, salt and grated crumbs and brown in 
the oven. 

Mock Wild Duck 

IV2 pounds round steak Salt and pepper 

2 lamb kidneys Powdered thyme and sage 
14 cup drippings 2 tablespoons flour 

V2 cup cracker cnunbs 1 tablespoon sugar 

1 tablespoon minced onion 3 cups water or stock 

Choose a steak from the round, about one half inch thick. Trim 
the kidneys of all fat, cords and veins. Cut into small pieces and 
spread evenly over the steak, together with crumbs, onion and 

«8 429 



FIRELESS COOKERY FamTolrJu'r 

seasonings. Roll and tie with a cord. Brown the roll in the 
drippings; then remove and make a gravy by heating the flour in 
the fat and adding the water or stock and the sugar. Return the 
meat to the gravy; heat it thoroughly; place in the fireless 
cooker and cook until tender. Just before serving time remove 
the roll and brown it in the oven. 

VEGETABLES 

Many vegetables are cooked best in a fireless cooker, because 
the food value and taste are developed. For those vegetables 
that are cooked or boiled in water, the usual recipes can be applied. 
It is only necessary to put sufficient boiling water over the vege- 
tables before placing in the cooker. One radiator is used. In 
baking such vegetables as potatoes, apples, etc., both radiators 
are used. Ordinary sized potatoes require from three quarters to 
one hour cooking time. 

Vegetables may be cooked by all of the following three methods, 
and each housewife should determine to her own satisfaction which 
method gives the best results: 

1. Vegetable first brought to boiling point and placed in cooker 
without radiator. 

2. Vegetable first brought to boil and placed in the cooker with 
heated radiator. 

3. Vegetable placed in cooker cold and raw with heated radiator. 
All good cooks are aware that some kinds of vegetables are better 

when cooked at a boil, such as potatoes and other vegetables con- 
taining a large percentage of starch; while other vegetables, such 
as parsnips, carrots and turnips, containing but little starch, are 
hardened by high heat and should be cooked slowly without 
radiators. Again, green peas and asparagus, containing much 
sugar, are better cooked without the radiators, as there will be no 
violent boiling. 

ASPARAGUS 

Wash the asparagus; cut off tough ends; cover with boiling 
water and place in cooker for one hour. Drain off the water and 
cover with milk; season with salt and pepper; heat and serve. 

BOILED BEETS 

Wash and scrub, but do not cut the beets. Cover with boiling 
water and allow to boil fifteen minutes. Place in cooker for two 

430 



gimn^VfVur FIRELESS COOKERY 

hours or more, depending upon the age of the beets. Remove 
from cooker; put beets in cold water for a minute; slip off the 
skins, and cut the beets in small pieces. Season with salt, pepper 
and butter, or any sauce you may prefer. To retain the color of 
the beets leave on the root and about one half inch of leaves. 



BEET GREENS 

Wash and pick over the greens carefully; add one cup of boiling 
water for each quart of greens. Boil slowly for ten minutes; place 
kettle in cooker for two hours. Drain off the water; add salt, 
pepper and butter; reheat and serve. 



PICKLED BEETS 

2 cups boiling water 2 cups vinegar 

4 tablespoons sugar 1 tablespoon salt 

y^ teaspoon pepper 10 cloves 

1 stick cinnamon 10 peppercorns 

Boil the beets as usual ; peel and cut them into slices ; place 
in glass jar. Mix the sugar, salt, pepper and spices in the water; 
add vinegar and heat almost to the boiling point. Pour this 
over the beets and allow them to stand twenty-four hours before 
serving. 

BAKED BEANS 

Clean the beans and soak in cold water over night. Drain off 
this water and add enough fresh water to cover them. Add a half 
pound of salt pork to each quart of beans (measured before soak- 
ing); add salt, pepper and molasses or sugar to suit taste. Boil 
for ten or fifteen minutes; place kettle in cooker for six or eight 
hours. Remove to earthen dish and bake for two hours or until 
beans are well browned. 

BOILED CABBAGE 

Remove outside leaves; cut into quarters and cut out tough 
center. Put into kettle and cover with boiling salted water; allow 
to boil for ten minutes without cover. Cover and place in cooker 
for one hour. Season with butter, salt and pepper, or serve with 
cream sauce.

MASHED POTATOES 

Wash and pare the potatoes; cut into pieces of uniform size; 
cover with boiling salted water and boil for five minutes. Place 
in cooker for an hour or an hour and a half, depending upon the 
size of the pieces and amount in the kettle; drain, mash, add salt, 
pepper, milk and butter. Beat until smooth. 



STEAMED POTATOES 

Wash the potatoes in fresh water; put them into the kettle and 
cover with water (hot water preferred), clamping the lid on the 
kettle. Heat one radiator twenty minutes; place kettle over the 
radiator while heating. Pour the water off the potatoes, allowing 
only a little to remain and put the kettle into the cooker over the 
radiator. Cook for an hour and a half. Potatoes may be pared 
or unpared. 

BAKED POTATOES 

Wash and dry medium-sized potatoes; put them in a pan and 
bake in the fireless for forty -five minutes. After fifteen minutes 
raise the cover quickly and allow the steam to escape. 



CREAMED POTATOES 

Wash and pare the potatoes; cut into one-half-inch cubes; 
place in kettle and cover with boiling salted water. Boil three 
minutes and place in cooker for forty-five minutes. Drain and 
cover with cream sauce. Large amounts of potatoes may be 
cooked in the cooker in this way without danger of their breaking.

POTATOES FOR SALAD 

Select potatoes of uniform size; wash and remove the eyes. 
Place potatoes in kettle and cover with boiling water. Add one 
tablespoon of salt for each quart of water. Boil five minutes if 
potatoes are small, ten if large. Place in cooker for two hours. 
Drain and allow to cool uncovered.

sauer kraut; cover with water and boil for ten minutes. Put in 
the cooker and allow it to remain for six hours. 

SPINACH 

Clean and wash the spinach, carefully removing roots; place in 
kettle and add half as much boiling water as spinach; salt and boil 
slowly ten minutes. Place in cooker three hours; drain; add 
butter, salt and pepper. Serve with vinegar and hard-boiled 

eggs. 

STUFFED PEPPERS 

To prepare red and green sweet peppers for stuffing, cut off the 
top and with a knife cut out and remove the veins and seeds. The 
peppers may be filled with a variety of mixtures — chopped cold 
meats and seasoned bread crumbs and onion juice, or other sea- 
soning, or plain boiled rice; in any or all cases moisten liberally 
with melted butter. Stand close together in a dish; pour on a 
little stock or boiling water and bake in the cooker for one half 
hour. 

SQUASH 

Cut the squash into pieces; remove seeds and pare. Cut into 
small pieces^and add water almost to cover. Boil ten minutes 
and place in cooker two hours. Drain, mash and season with but- 
ter, salt and pepper. If the butter is browned sHghtly it will im- 
prove the flavor. 

STRING BEANS 

Break rather than cut the beans into small pieces of about one 
half inch and, unless they are very fresh, it is well to soak them in 
ice water one hour before cooking. Then throw them into boiling 
water; season with salt and pepper and a little butter. Cover 
the dish; place in the cooker and leave two hours or more.

and serve hot. Use two radiators. 



YELLOW TURNIPS 

Prepare yellow turnips or rutabagas, as they are sometimes 
called, in the same manner as white turnips, but leave in the cooker 
from one to two hours longer, as they require more cooking. 



BOILED TOMATOES 

Wash the tomatoes and pour boiling water over them, allowing 
them to remain in it about one half minute or less if they are very 
ripe. Cover with cold water and peel. Cut into pieces and add 
salt, pepper to taste, butter and a small amount of sugar. Boil 
for five minutes; place in cooker and allow to remain one hour. 

STEWED TOMATOES

MACARONI WITH CHEESE 

Cook the macaroni as for baking. Place a layer of macaroni 
in a pudding dish; cover with a layer of cream sauce and a layer 
of grated cheese. Alternate until the dish is filled. Put layer of 
bread crumbs on top with bits of butter. Bake for two hours, 
using both radiators. 

MACARONI WITH TOMATOES 

Prepare macaroni as for baking. Put layer of tomatoes in 
pudding dish; cover with macaroni; season with salt, pepper and 
butter. Repeat this until the dish is full. Sprinkle cracker 
crumbs on the top with bits of butter. Bake slowly for an hour. 

BREAD AND BISCUITS 

In baking bread or biscuits the fireless cooker is a pronounced 
success, as it browns the crusts and bakes thoroughly without 
burning. The cooker is also an excellent place to set the sponge 
to rise, for the temperature is always the same, and no matter 
what condition the kitchen may be in over night, the sponge will 
be kept perfectly warm. 

Use two radiators for baking bread, biscuits, cakes and pies, 
placing one radiator below bread or pastry rack and one above, 
and have only one pan of bread, cake or pie in the rack at a time. 
After the pastry has been in the cooker ten or fifteen minutes, 
open and close quickly the top of the cooker and let the steam es- 
cape. Do not open again until the full cooking time has elapsed. 
Opening the cooker and letting out the steam prevents the bread 
and pastry from becoming soggy and permits it to brown. 

The regular recipes can be used, but several are here given. A 
few experiments will enable one to make a satisfactory time 
schedule. 

BREAD 

4 potatoes 1 cake compressed yeast 

1 quart water 1 tablespoon lukewarm water 

2 tablespoons salt 3 quarts flour

dish and leave over night in the cooker, so as to keep it warm and 
out of drafts. In the morning rub the lard into the flour; add the 
yeast; mix down, adding enough flour to make it stiff; place this 
in large aluminum pail and put it into the cooker to rise. When 
light, cut into loaves; work down smooth and put in the large 
aluminum vessel. Have the radiators hot and use them just the 
same as when roasting beef. 

TEA BISCUITS

CAKE 



Any kind of cake can be baked in the fireless cooker; but dif- 
ferent cakes require different heats, which can only be learned by 
experience. For instance : a batter with butter in it requires more 
heat than a light batter without butter. One must consider this 
fact in heating the radiators and in keeping the cake in the cooker. 
Use ordinary cake pans, placing same in bread and pastry rack 
which is furnished, using two radiators. It is a good plan after 
the cake has been in the cooker ten or fifteen minutes to open the 
top quickly and let the steam escape. 

Below are a few recipes that have been well tried out on the 
fireless cooker. 

ANGEL CAKE 

i cup sifted flour Whites of 8 to 10 eggs 

1V4 cups sifted sugar Pinch of salt 

V2 teaspoon cream of tartar 

Sift the flour four or five times before measuring; then sift and 
measure the sugar. Add the salt to the eggs; beat them to a 
froth; add cream of tartar and beat until very stiff . Stir in sugar; 
then flour, very lightly. Put in a pan in the pastry rack and bake 
between two moderately hot radiators.

PAPER-BAG COOKERY 



PAPER-BAG COOKERY 

IT would be absurd to claim that cooking in paper bags is to 
take the place of cooking by all other methods; but it appeals 
to many housewives as an economical, labor-saving method of 
preparing a meal. The sealed bag prevents loss of rich juices 
and flavors; prevents loss of weight in meats; and saves the 
washing of pots and pans — always a disagreeable task. Further, 
the paper bag, like the casserole and the fireless cooker, offers 
opportunity for economy in meats; for cuts of meat and poultry 
too tough for use by the old method are made tender by cooking 
in the paper bag. 

Success depends in large measure upon the bags, and it is safe 
to use only those manufactured for the purpose. These are 
odorless and entirely free from impurities. A bag containing a 
break or hole should never be used and in cooking very juicy 
dishes it is sometimes wise to set the rack holding the bag on a 
shallow dish so that in case the bag should break there may be 
no loss of juices. Always place the seam side up. 

Select a bag that will conveniently hold the food — one that is 
neither too large nor too small. Grease it thoroughly on the 
inside, using butter or drippings. The grease makes the paper 
still more air-proof and is essential to the success of the process. 
Apply the grease with a brush, taking care to select one from 
which the bristles will not be likely to fall; or, better, put several 
tablespoons of melted grease in the bag; lay it flat on the table 
and press from the bottom upward until both sides are thor- 
oughly greased. 

When the food is prepared, put it in the bag carefully; fold 
the open end several times and fasten with paper clips or pins. 
Fold the corners at the other end of the bag also to insure against 

451 



PAPER-BAG COOKERY FamX" t^ '/Jur 

leakage. Do not crease with the finger nail or the paper may 
break in the oven. Some cooks moisten the bags to make them 
more pliable. 

Be sure that the oven is well heated when the food is put in. 
A gas oven should be lighted for at least ten minutes before using 
and the average oven heat should not be less than 200° F. On 
the other hand the oven should not be too hot, or the bags will 
char quickly and it will be almost impossible to remove the food. 

After the first fifteen minutes the heat should be slightly 
reduced; for long, slow cooking will secure a better result. Let 
the bag rest on a rack and not on the floor of the oven, as the 
air should circulate freely around it. If the oven shelves are 
solid, the bag should be elevated on a wire rack or broiler laid 
across a pan. The rack is a wise provision anyway, as it makes 
the removal of the bag easier. 

If the temperature is right the food will brown in the closed 
bag; but many cooks advise puncturing the bag when the pro- 
duct is nearly done in order to make the brown crust a certainty. 

If the bag should accidentally break before the food is done, 
place it in another bag or fold over the broken portion and fasten 
with paper clips. There is really small danger of breakage if 
the proper precautions are taken. 

To remove the food, open the door of the oven — very carefully 
if it is a gas oven, as a heavy jar will sometimes set fire to the 
paper; hold a flat board or platter in the left hand and slip the 
bag gently upon this. Open the bag and remove the contents. 

PANNED OYSTERS OR CLAMS 

Put the oysters or clams into a buttered bag and cook for about 
fifteen minutes. Add butter and seasoning and serve. 

BREADED OYSTERS 

Wash the oysters; dip them in beaten egg; roll in fine bread 
crumbs; put into a buttered bag with two tablespoons of melted 
butter; seal the bag and cook in a hot oven for about eight minutes.

THE frying pan "that got into society" is too familiar to need 
an introduction, and where there are few servants it does 
occasionally make the serving of evening refreshments easier. At 
any rate the chafing dish has gained wide popularity, and nearly 
every woman who entertains is on the lookout for new recipes. 

A few practical suggestions may be worth while : 

Be sure that the lamp is filled and in working order. 

Place the dish on a tray to protect the table from fire. 

Have all the ingredients ready. 

Use the hot- water pan only when the preparation requires steam- 
ing or will be likely to burn. 

To cook quickly or to cook anything brown use only the blazer, 
and have it hot before turning in the food.

CASSEROLE COOKERY 



CASSEROLE COOKERY 

THE importance of casserole cookery can scarcely be over-em- 
phasized in this day of high cost of living. Some foods are 
necessarily better if cooked by a long slow process, and cheaper 
foods are rendered more palatable than expensive ones. The 
earthenware dishes, moreover, are always attractive, whether 
encased in silver or not. The quaint artistic shapes make even 
a very common article of food look interesting and attractive. 

The French, who have gained a name for economy in household 
matters, have reduced casserole cooking to a science; and it would 
be worth the while of any American housekeeper to see what others 
have done. Then, if she is thrifty, she will serve instead of sirloin 
steak at thirty cents a pound, rump steak en casserole at twenty. 
Instead of roasting she will buy stewing meats, at about half the 
price; instead of an untempting hash she will have some dainty, 
tasty viand (made from left-overs) in ramekins. And her family 
will in no wise suffer by her economy. 

All casserole and ramekin foods are served in the dishes in which 
they are cooked; so there is no loss of heat in transference. There 
is also economy in pans and dishes, if that is a consideration. The 
ramekins should rest upon paper or linen doilies. 

CHICKEN EN CASSEROLE

2 tablespoons butter 3 small onions sliced 
2 cups hot water 4 tablespoons sherry

time is up saute the vegetables in butter until brown; remove 
to the casserole; add the sherry and seasoning; cover and return

fully make a dough of flour and water; roll into a rope and press 
upon the dish where vessel and cover meet; remove before serving. 

BEEFSTEAK EN CASSEROLE

inches thick; sear in a frying pan; put in the casserole, brushing 
first with butter and seasoning. Cook until tender; parboil 
the carrots and saute them in the drippings with the onion; add 
these, the potatoes, brown sauce and sherry to the meat; cook 
until the potatoes are tender and serve from the casserole.

the vegetables; put the meat in the casserole with the vegetables 
around it; add the water or stock and cook in a hot oven for

GOOD TO REMEMBER 

One teaspoon or tablespoon means a rounded teaspoon or tablespoon unless 
otherwise stated. 

A tin or aluminum measuring cup should be used for all measuring. These 
cups are marked off in quarters and thirds and insure accuracy. 

Aluminum cooking utensils are the best for general use. They are expensive 
in the beginning, but outwear other kinds. They are light in weight and easily 
cleaned, and there is no enamel to chip off and poison the food. 

Discolored pans and kettles, not aluminum, should be boiled in water to which 
a lump of washmg soda has been added. 

Scrupulous cleanliness and eternal vigilance are the essentials of all good cooking. 
^ If the oven becomes too hot while bread or cake is baking, it may be cooled by 
setting a pan of water in it. 

If bread or cake browns too quickly, cover with a piece of paper. 

Pies should always be baked in a quick oven, with the greatest heat at the bottom. 

Cakes will seldom stick if this direction is followed : Grease the pans carefully ; 
dust lightly with flour; shake out the superfluous flour and pour in the mixture. 

Muffins and gems will be lighter if baked in pans that have been thoroughly 
heated as well as greased. 

Biscuit dough should be as soft as possible. Biscuits will be lighter and 
crisper if not allowed to touch each other on the baking tin. 

Meat should never be put in cold water except in making soup, for cold water 
draws out the juices. Wipe with a wet cloth, or rinse and dry at once, and in cooking 
useJaoiUng water. 

Tomatoes that are too strongly acid are improved by a pinch of baking soda. 
The soda should always be added when they are to be mixed with milk or cream, 
to prevent curdling. 

The white of eggs will whip more readily if a pinch of salt is added. The eggs 
should be as cold as possible. 

Cream that is too thin to whip may be made to do so by the addition of an 
unbeaten white of egg. 

When dipping articles in egg and cracker, dilute the egg with a tablespoon of 
water. Only the white may be used, if desired, but never only the yolk, as it is the 
albtunen which is needed to form a coat which the grease cannot penetrate. 

Almost any dish is made more inviting by a little garnishing. Parsley, water- 
cress, slices of lemon, beet, onion, hard-boiled egg or maraschino cherry, small 
triangles of toast, potato balls, mashed potatoes pressed through a pastry tube — 
all these are useful and within reach of almost every cook. Paper doilies, paper 
cups, and paper frills for chops may also be used to good advantage: these may be 
bought at any stationer's.
