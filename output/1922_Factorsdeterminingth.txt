Factors Determining the Quality) of White Sauce in 
Large Quantity Cooking. 

1— INTRODUCTION 

Very little attention has been given to changes which are necessary 
in adapting small quantity recipes for large quantity cooking. Exper- 
ience has suggested that some clianges are necessary. It is the purpose 
of this thesis to determine what these changes should be in the case of 
the preparation of white sauce, and to discover the reasons why these 
changes are necessary. 

White sauce is composed of fat, salt, flour and milk thickened by 
cooking. As tised in all cooking work it falls naturally into four types. 

1. Thin, used in soups. 

2. Medium, used in creamed dishes. 

3. Thick, used in scalloped dishes and souffles. 

4. Very thick, used in croquettes. 

In order to get a satisfactory and uniform product, exact propor- 
tions must be used, and certain methods of mixing and cooking and 
time of cooking must be followed. The time of adding salt is also im- 
portant. 

The following four methods of mixing are customarily used in the 
preparation of white sauce. 

1. Heat the milk, mix the flour with the melted fat, stir into 

the hot milk, cook, add the salt. 

2. Retain one-fourth of the cold milk, heat the remainder with 

the fat, combine the cold milk and flour, add to the hot 
milk, stirring constantly, cook, add the salt. 

3. Heat the milk, mix the flour and cold fat together, add to 

the milk stirring constantly, cook, add the salt. 

4. Mix the flour and cold fat together, add the cold milk stirring 

constantly, cook, add the salt. 
The following two methods of cooking are used in the preparation 
of white sauce. 

1. Double-boiler. 

2. Covered, in the steamer. 

The following ingredients and proportions of ingredients are cus- 
tomarily used in the preparation of white sauce in small quantities.

Methods of Mixing 

Small quantities of white sauce of each type were prepared by each 
of the four methods of mixing, using one cup of milk. 

Large quantities of white sauce of each type were prepared, using 
one gallon of milk. The results were compared. Microscopic examina-

The same methods of mixing may be used for large quantities of 
white sauce as for small quantities, if it is cooked in a double-boiler. 

The first method, of mixing is the best for the making of white 
sauce which is to be made in the steamer because it does not need so 
much stirring. The white sauce is the thickest and most smooth. 

Method number two is the least desirable in the steamer as it makes 
the thinnest white sauce, because the heat of th milk coats the starch 
grains before the moisture has a chance to cause them to swell and 
burst. The microscopic examination revealed the fact that the starch 
grains were more in tact by this method of mixing than by any other. 

There is very little difference in the quality of white sauce made 
by method one and method three. White sauce made by method three 
is slightly thinner, due to the starch grains being partially sealed be- 
fore having a chance to expand. 

Method number four is the least desirable for the preparation of 
large quantities of white sauce when cooked in the steamer, because 
the flour settles to the bottom and cooks in a cake. The sauce is 
lumpy because it cannot be stirred so often as when cooked in a double- 
boiler. 

Methods of Cooking 

Small quantities of white sauce of each type were prepared by each 
of the two methods of cooking, using one cup of milk. 

Large quantities of white sauce of each type were prepared, using 
one gallon of milk. The results were compared. The reasons for varia- 
tions were determined.

Smooth white sauce may be made by each method of cooking. 

The method of cooking is determined by the quantity of white sauce 
to be made. 

Large quantities of white sauce are more easily and more quickly 
made in a steamer. 

White sauces cooked in a covered steamer are thinner than the same 
proportions made in a double-boiler, because there is less chance for the 
evaporation of moisture. Then too, the pressure* of the steam hydrolyzes 
some of the starch making a soluble compound hence making the sauce 
thinner. Continued cooking causes white sauce to become thinner, be- 
cause more of the starch is hydrolyzed. 

White sauce made in a double-boiler is more apt to be lumpy than 
that cooked in a covered steamer, because there is more of a chance for 
a dry film to form on the top and this makes a lumpy appearance when 
the sauce is stirred. 

White sauce cooked in a covered steamer has a better flavor than 
the same proportions cooked in a double-boiler for the same length of 
time, because the starch is more completely cooked.

Whole milk and skimmed milk may be used in the preparation of 
white sauce. 

White sauce made with whole milk is thinner than that made with 
skimmed milk, all other factors remaining constant, because whole milk 
contains more fat which is a liquid when the white sauce is hot. 

Whole milk produces a richer white sauce than skimmed milk, be- 
cause of the larger amount of fat. 

Whole milk with the large proportions of fat and flour in each type 
produces the richest white sauce, while skimmed milk with an equal 
amount of nut oleo produces a sauce which is lowest in food value. 

White sauce made with skimmed milk is whiter and less smooth 
than that made with whole milk, because the skimmed milk contains 
more protein and less fat. 

White sauce made with skimmed milk is cheaper than that made 
with whole milk. Skimmed milk usually costs about one-third as much 
as whole milk. 

The difference in the proportion of flour necessary to make a white 
sauce of the same consistency with whole milk as with skimmed milk is 
so small that it is not advisable to consider it for practical purposes. 

Kind of Fat 

Large quantities of white sauce of each type were prepared with 
butter and with nut oleo, all other factors remaining constant. Results 
were compared. Reasons for variations were determined.

Butter and nut oleo are desirable fats for the making of white sauce. 

Butter makes a thinner and smoother white sauce than the same 
amount of nut oleo, the other ingredients remaining constant, because 
butter has a higher fat content. 

Butter produces a better flavored white sauce than oleo because it 
is more mild, less salty and does not have the peculiar flavor as pro- 
duced by the same amount of nut oleo. 

Butter produces a white sauce higher in food value than nut oleo, 
because it has a larger amount of fat. 

Butter with whole milk produces a thinner but richer white sauce 



WHITE SAUCE IN LARGE QUANTITY COOKING 



11 



than the same amount of nut oleo, because butter has a higher fat con- 
tent. 

White sauce made with whole milk and nut oleo is richer than that 
made with skimmed milk, but is desirable for large quantity cooking. 

The difference in the proportion of flour necessary to make a white 
sauce of the same consistency with butter as with nut oleo is so small 
that it is not advisable to consider it for practical purposes. 



Time of Adding Salt 

Large quantities of white sauce of each type were prepared adding 
the salt before cooking and after cooking, all other factors remaining con- 
stant. Results were compared. Reasons for the difference in consist- 
ency determined.

When salt is added to white sauce before cooking the product Is 
thinner than when the salt is added after cooking. This condition is due 
to hydrolysis which changes eome of the starch into a soluble compound. 

White sauce is curdled when the salt is added before cooking, due to 
an acid reaction. 

When salt is added to the white sauce after cooking the product is 
smoother, thicker and has a better flavor. 

Relative proportions of fat and flour with the same quantity of 
white sauce. 

1. Large quantities of white sauce of each type were prepared with 
different amounts of nut oleo, all other factors remaining constant. Re- 
sults were compared. 

2. Changes in the proportions of flour determined to give the same 
consistency with different amounts of nut oleo.

WHITE SAUCE IN LAR(iE QUANTITY COOKING 13 

The large proportions of fat produce a white sauce which is thin, 
curdled, too rich and has the fat separating from it. 

White sauce made with considerably less fat than flour by weight 
is apt to be lumpy, because there is not enough fat to allow the flour to 
be diffused into the liquid, so the flour cooks as lumps of starch. 

The best quality of white sauce is produced in each type when the 
amount of fat is reduced instead of increasing the amount of flour. 

An equal weight of fat and flour in each type of white sauce produces 
the best results. 

More flour is needed with whole milk than with skimmed milk to 
make white sauce of the same consistency. However the difference in 
the amount of flour is so small that it is not/ practical to take into con- 
sideration. 

More flour is needed if large quantities of white sauce are cooked in 
a covered steamer, because there is less chance for the evaporation of 
moisture and more of a chance for the starch to be hydrolyzed because of 
the steam pressure. 

Changes in the proportions of fat and flour when 

multiplying the small quantity proportions 

for preparing large quantities 

SmaJl quantities of each type of white sauce were prepared. 

Large quantities of white sauce of each type were prepared multiply- 
ing small quantity recipe by sixteen. The differences in consistency 
were determined. 

1 — Changes determined in the proportion of fat necessary to make 
large quantity of the s!>me consistency as the small quantity, all other 
factors remaining constant. 

2 — Changes determined in the proportion of flour necessary to make 
large quantity of same consistency as the small quantity, all other fac- 
tors remaining constant. The reasons for variations were investigated.

proportion 

The small proportions for the different types of white sauce cannot 
be multiplied by sixteen and have a product of the same consistency. 

The white sauce is richer if the proportion of flour is increased to 
give the same consistency. It is not so desirable because it is too rich. 

For practical purposes it is more desirable to reduce the proportion 
of fat in each type of white sauce in order to have the same consistency, 
because a better product is obtained. 

The differences in the consistency of the small and the large quan- 
tities of white sauce, are due to the shorter periods of time required for 
the cooking of ^he large quantity in proportion to the time* as required 
for the small quantity. 

The evaporation of moisture is less in proportion to the large quan- 
tity of white sauce than the small quantity, because there is less sur- 
face exposed in proportion to the amount of sauce made. According to 
the measurements of the utensils used for the experiments there was 
only 4.6 times as much surface exposed for evaporation from the 
large quantity, (1 gallon) as for the small quantity. (1 cup). 

A shorter period of time is required for the cooking of the large 
quantity of white sauce in proportion to the length of time as required 
for the small quantity. 

III. GENERAL SUMMARY. 
From the economical and practical point of view as regards time 

*Small quantities were cooked fifteen minutes. 
*Large quantities were cooked thirty minutes. 



WHITE SAUSE IN LARGE QUANTITY COOKING

and money the following conclusions seem reasonable according to data 
presented. 

1. The first method of mixing is the best for the making of large 
quantities of white sauce. 

2. The best quality of white sauce is obtained in the shortest time 
in the covered steamer. 

3. Butter makes the best flavored white sauce but it is too expen- 
sive for the making of large quantities of white sauce for all institu- 
tional purposes. 

4. Whole milk and nut oleo produces a white sauce which is desir- 
able for practical purposes in large quantity cooking. 

5. Salt should be added after cooking to make a sauce of the best 
quality. 

6. An equal weight of fat and flour in each type of white sauce 
produces the best product. 

7. The proportions for one cup of white sauce cannot be multiplied 
by sixteen to make one gallon having the same quality. Changes in the 
proportions of fat and flour are necessary.
