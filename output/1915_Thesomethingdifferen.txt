TO MY SISTER 



PREFACE 

I do not pretend to claim originality for the fol- 
lowing one hundred recipes for making dishes that 
are different, but I guarantee that all have been 
tried and tested, and care has been taken to see 
that they are simple and practical. 

The illustrations and one-half of the recipes ap- 
peared in the Cookery columns of The Ladies' 
Home Journal during the last five years, from 
whence they have been gathered at the request of 
many readers, to save reference to back issues not 
always within reach. 

The courtesy of The Ladies' Home Journal is 
acknowledged with sincere thanks for permission 
to use the pictures and recipes in book form.

SOUP RECIPES 



COCK-A-LEEKIE 

i capon or old fowl i tablespoonful chopped 

8 or 9 leeks parsley 

2 quarts (8 cups) cold 4 tablespoonfuls rice 

water Salt and white pepper to 

taste 

Draw and truss the fowl as for boiling. Put it 
into a soup pot with the water. Add one teaspoon- 
ful of salt and the giblets carefully washed. Bring 
to boiling point and skim well. Then simmer for 
two hours, skimming occasionally. Take off the 
outside skins. Remove the roots and most of the 
green from the leeks, and split them in halves 
lengthways. Wash and rinse them well, cut in 
thin slices and wash again. Drain and add them 
to the soup with the rice. Simmer until the fowl 
is tender. To serve, lift out the bird and the 
giblets from the soup, remove all grease from the 
top and add the parsley and seasonings.

14 The Something-Different Dish 

The fowl may either be served whole with 
parsley sauce poured over it, or half of it may be 
cut in neat pieces, then served in the soup, and 
the other half reserved for croquettes or some 
other dish. Sometimes this soup is thickened 
with fine oatmeal. A few stewed prunes are 
sometimes served in Cock-A-Leekie. 

Frequently an old cock is used for making this 
soup which gives the recipe its name. This soup 
is an excellent stomachic, and is said to be capable 
of curing a severe cold. Mrs. Isabella Beeton 
states that Cock-A-Leekie was largely consumed 
at the Burns' Centenary Festival at the Crystal 
Palace, Sydenham, 1859. 



YOUNG FISHERMAN 

3 lbs. different kinds 1 teaspoonful vinegar 

fresh water fish 1 teaspoonful soy 

2 carrots 2 turnips 

1 large tomato 1 stalk celery 

1 leek Salt, pepper and paprika 

2 onions to taste 
Bunch sweet herbs Water 



Soup Recipes 15 

Cut the turnips and celery into small pieces, 
boil until tender and drain. Wash the fish, put 
them into a saucepan with the sliced tomato, 
chopped carrots, sliced leek, herbs and the onions 
sliced and fried in a little butter; cover with cold 
water, and let them stew until the whole is re- 
duced to a pulp, which will be in about an hour. 
Strain off the liquor, and let it simmer for another 
hour. Add the turnips and celery, with the vine- 
gar, soy and seasonings to taste. Serve hot. 



MULLIGATAWNY 

1*4 lbs. lean mutton 1 dessertspoonful curry 

2 ozs. (4 tablespoonfuls) powder 

butter or drippings 1 teaspoonf ul curry paste 

3 pints (6 cups) cold water \]/2 ozs. (6 tablespoon- 

or stock fuls) flour 

2 onions ^2 pint (1 cup) hot milk 

1 sour apple 1 tablespoonful chutney 

4 tablespoonfuls chopped 1 bunch herbs 

ham Salt and pepper to taste 

Yz small carrot 1 lemon 

yi small turnip Boiled rice 

Wipe the meat and cut it in small pieces. 



16 The Something-Different Dish 

Melt the butter or drippings in a saucepan, add 
to it the apple and vegetables cut in small pieces, 
and cook for five minutes over the fire. Add the 
curry powder, curry paste, chutney and flour, 
and mix well; then add the water or stock, meat, 
herbs, salt and pepper. Stir over the fire for five 
minutes and then simmer for two hours, skim- 
ming when necessary. When ready, strain 
through a fine sieve into a basin. Lift out the 
best pieces of the meat for serving in the soup 
and rub as much as possible of the remainder 
through the sieve. 

Rinse out the saucepan and return the soup 
to it with the meat. Season carefully, add one 
tablespoonful of lemon juice and the hot milk 
just before serving. Serve the soup with plain 
boiled rice. If liked a lemon cut in quarters may 
also be handed. 

The addition of a little cream is a great improve- 
ment to this soup. 

Mulligatawny signifies pepper-water. It seems 
to have come into fashion at the time Dr. Kitch- 
ener wrote his famous "Cook's Oracle." He 



Soup Recipes 17 

speaks of it as a fashionable soup, and a great 
favorite with our East Indian friends. In a foot- 
note he says, "The progress of inexperienced, 
peripatetic politicians has lately been arrested by 
this outlandish word being pasted in the windows 
of our coffee-houses; it has, we believe, answered 
the restaurateur's purpose, and often excited 
John Bull to walk in and taste; the more familiar 
name of curry soup would, perhaps, not have had 
sufficient of the charm of novelty to seduce him 
from his much-loved mock turtle."

viously rubbed through a sieve, and the parsley. 
Serve hot. 



Fish Recipes 23 

Kedgeree is the name given to a medley com- 
posed of fish, boiled rice, and hard-cooked eggs, 
but it owes its name to the Hindu word "khichri," 
meaning a medley or assortment, and not to the 
name of a place on the Hoogly River, forty miles 
southwest of Calcutta, India.

1 boiled cabbage drippings 

Pepper 

Cut the salt beef in thin slices and sprinkle it 
over with a little pepper; melt the butter or drip- 
pings in a frying-pan. When hot put the beef 
into it, and fry on both sides until it is a golden 
color; then take up, put the pieces of meat be- 
tween two plates, and keep them hot over boiling 
water. Chop the cabbage, put it into the pan in 
which the beef was fried, and fry it for five min- 
utes; turn it out in the center of a hot dish and 
arrange the slices of beef round. Serve very hot. 

If liked, cold mashed potatoes, shredded onions 

and a little vinegar may be added.

plied to an old English dish of fried beef and 
cabbage. 

" When 'midst the frying-pan, in accents savage, 
The beef so surly quarrels with the cabbage." 

Dr. Kitchener set the lines to music, and fur- 
nished a sauce for the dish. Even George Augusta 
Sala, who was both a clever cook and a conscien- 
tious epicure, was very fond of boiled beef when it 
was served a la Bubble and Squeak.

powder and a pinch of salt and mix well. Make 
this into a stimsh paste with cold water; roll it 
out into a round cake the size of the stewpan, and 
put it on the top of the meat and vegetables. 
Continue the stewing until the meat is quite 
tender, and the vegetables and pastry well cooked. 



Meat Recipes 35 

The crust should be loosened from the sides of 
the saucepan occasionally, and more liquid added 
if necessary. Cut the pastry across into six 
pieces. Lift out the meat and vegetables and 
arrange them on a hot platter, place the pastry 
on the top and garnish with a few pieces of the 
carrot. 

TRIPLE ALLIANCE 

Cooked potatoes Cooked meat made into 

Cooked turnips balls 

Melted butter 

Reheat the turnips and potatoes in separate 
dishes placed in a steamer or in boiling water. 
Mound the turnips on a hot dish; then cover with 
the potatoes, mashed and forced through a bag 
and star tube, or made rough with a fork. Ar- 
range balls of meat here and there about the base. 
At the top make an indentation, and fill it with 
melted butter, so that it will trickle down the 
crinkly sides of the potato. 

Triple alliance is a combination of potatoes, 
turnips and meat. 



36 The Something-Different Dish 



HARICOT 

2 lbs. best end neck of yi pint (1 cup) cooked 

mutton peas or beans 

2 ozs. (4 tablespoonfuls) 2 boiled carrots 

butter or drippings 2 boiled turnips 

6 diced onions 1 tablespoonful mush- 

1 tablespoonful flour room catchup 

1 bunch herbs Water 

Salt and pepper to taste 

Trim off some of the fat, remove all the un- 
necessary bone, cut the mutton into rather thin 
chops, and put them into a frying-pan with the 
butter or drippings. Fry them a pale brown, 
but do not cook them enough for eating. Take 
up the mutton and put it in the bottom of a 
stewpan. Fry the onions slightly in the same fat 
as the mutton was browned in, but do not allow 
them to take any color. Sprinkle the flour over 
the meat, add the onions, drained, cover with 
cold water, and bring to the boil, occasionally 
skimming; then put in the herbs and simmer for 
two hours. Add the carrots and turnips cut in 
slices, the peas or beans, catchup, and seasonings. 



Meat Recipes 37 

Simmer for ten minutes, then turn into a deep 
hot dish and serve at once. 

Haricot, the name given to a stew composed 
of chops from the best end of neck of mutton and 
the familiar vegetables which go by the collec- 
tive name of pot-herbs, is given by the most re- 
liable authorities as derived from the old French 
"Harigot," meaning a morsel, but more fanciful 
etymologists attach it to "haut-ragout," meaning 
something superior by way of stewed meat. 



CAVALIER'S BROIL 

1 moderate sized shoul- ^ pint (i}4 cups) 

der of mutton pickled mushrooms 

Salt and red pepper 

Half roast or parboil the shoulder of mutton, 
then lift it on to a hot dish, score on both sides 
down to the bone, season well with salt and red 
pepper, and finish cooking it over the fire or in 
the oven. 

Skim the fat from the gravy, and keep the dish 
which contains it quite hot to receive the joint

again. Warm the mushrooms, chop one-half cup- 
ful of them and sprinkle them over the broil; 
when it is ready to be served arrange the remainder 
round it and serve immediately. 

To make the pickled mushrooms: Take some 
small and round button mushrooms, throw them 
into cold water, and rub each separately with a 
piece of flannel dipped in salt to clean it; put 
them again into fresh cold water, and finally into 
a pan with a handful of fine salt scattered over 
them. Place over a moderate fire, having cov- 
ered them close so that the steam may not escape, 
for fifteen minutes, or until they are hot and the 
water is drawn well out of them; drain and dry 
well; keep them covered up from the air until 
they are cold; then place them in clean glass 
bottles with a blade of mace, fill up with white 
wine vinegar, and add to each bottle a teaspoonful 
of olive oil. Cork and seal.

6 button onions water or stock 

1 blade mace Forcemeat 

1 bay leaf Gravy 

4 ozs. iyi cup) butter 5 or 6 eggs 

1 bunch herbs Cooked spinach 

Prepare and stuff a young, plump fowl with 
forcemeat. Put it into a saucepan with a close- 
fitting lid, add the onions, mace, bay leaf, butter 
and if liked the herbs. When the fowl has hard- 
ened, and been turned, add the boiling water or 
stock. Fit on the lid very closely and set the 
saucepan over the fire. One hour will do a small 
fowl, the heavier ones take longer in proportion 
to their weight. Have a little seasoned gravy, 
in which parboil the liver. Poach five or six eggs 
nicely in this gravy. Dress them on flattened 
balls of cooked spinach around the fowl. Rub 
down the liver to thicken the gravy and liquor in 
which the fowl was cooked, skimming nicely,

dried currants is in great favor. It is rarely 
honored by its formal name of Currant Pudding, 
but is familiarly called Spotted Dick. The 
reason for the name is less obvious than that 
applied by cabinet-makers to the same pudding, 
which is known among them as "bird's-eye 
maple." Yet one other name, of which the 
pudding can scarcely be proud, is "hunter's 
pudding," which is suggestive of the distance 
between currant and currant.

GOOSEBERRY FOOL 

1 pint gooseberries 1 teaspoonful lemon 
14. pint (2 cups) boiled juice 

custard 1 gill (}4 cup)' water 

2 tablespoonfuls cream 2 ozs. (4 tablespoonfuls) 

sugar 

Wash, top and tail the gooseberries, and put 
them into a saucepan with the water and sugar; 
stew them until they are tender and soft. Rub 
through a fine sieve with a wooden spoon, not a 
metal spoon as it injures the flavor and color. 
When the custard is cold, stir it into the goose- 
berry puree, add the lemon juice, the cream and, 



64 The Something-Different Dish 

if necessary, more sugar. Serve either in one large 
glass dish or in custard glasses, having it as cold 
as possible. 

Two crumbled lady fingers are a nice addition 
to this dish. If more convenient the cream may 
be omitted, or, if wished, only cream used, and 
no custard. 

Rhubarb fool is made in exactly the same way, 
using eight sticks of peeled rhubarb in place of 
the gooseberries. 

Strawberry fool is made by merely rubbing the 
ripe strawberries through a sieve and adding a 
few drops of red color. Do not cook the fruit. 

Gooseberry fool is at all times popular, but it is 
best when made with fresh fruit. 

The name of this dish often puzzles people. 
This is an example of the degeneration of a foreign 
kitchen term, a corruption which has destroyed 
the descriptive meaning. Originally the qualify- 
ing adjective was written foule, because the stewed 
gooseberries were crushed before being mixed 
with the cream. In old French menus the dish is 
given as " Groseilles foules."

Maids of Honor are small lemon cheese cakes. 
Richmond near London, claims this particular 
dainty as its specialty. This is what the village 
gossips have to say about them: 

Way back in the mystic part of the 15 th cen- 
tury some ingenious Richmond housewife con- 
cocted a wonderful recipe for making sweetened 
cheese cakes, and, thrifty housewife that she was, 
locked it in a strong box, against the onslaughts 
of borrowing neighbors. With almost anything 
else you could guess, "One of butter, two of sugar, 
three of flour and four of eggs," or something of 
the sort, and produce a creditable imitation, but 
with "Maids of Honor" it's different. Chemists 
have tried to analyze them, astrologers to cast 
their horoscopes, but one can do nothing of the 
sort. They defy detection; indeed, you don't 
really taste any cheese in them at all, and they 
seem to appear for the prime sensible purpose 
only of quickly disappearing under the motto 
"To be eaten." 



Cakes 71 

One fine day Mistress Anne Boleyn found her- 
self heiress to this precious recipe. That was 
when she was at the Court of Henry VIII, then 
on his progress through Reading. In those days 
kings had a way of happening around when least 
expected, and so when Mistress Boleyn and her 
honorable companion were feasting from her ad- 
mirable baking, whiling away the time that the 

"King was in his counting house, 
Counting out the money; 
The Queen was in her pantry, 
Eating bread and honey," 

with nothing else to do, the little company sud- 
denly found Bluff King Hal in their midst roaring 
out, "What have we here?" 

Before they could answer him or hide away the 
feast, the Majesty of England sat him down, and, 
as the old chronicle has it, devoured "foarteen 
gode cakes withouten compunction!" much to 
the sorrow of the hungry maids of honor, who 
found little consolation in his approbation. So 
good did they taste he begged to know the name 
of the delicious cakes. 



72 The Something-Different Dish 

"Your Majesty, they haven't any," Mistress 
Boleyn was forced to confess. "Then," cried 
the King, "since no name have they I shall stand 
sponsor to them; let them be called 'Maids of 
Honor' hereafter, so sweet they are," after which 
pretty compliment in payment for his feast he 
strolled out into his garden. 

Naturally, the cakes immediately became the 
talk of the Court, and, years after, the recipe 
found its way back to "Richmond Towne."

be an inch in thickness when baked. Let cool, 
and then cut in long strips, spread each strip with 
sieved strawberry jam, and place them together, 
one pink and one yellow alternately, three or four 
in a row, and one row above the other until you 
have the same number each way. Press them all 
together and roll up in a piece of white paper until 
stuck. Form knots with round pieces of marzipan 
icing, cover these knots and the ends of the cake 
with fondant icing and mark them with a little 
melted chocolate or brown color. Put some choco- 
late or coffee fondant icing into a bag with a tube 
and force it along the sides and top of the cake to 
represent the bark of a tree, then sprinkle over 
with a few chopped pistachio nuts and decorate 
with two little robins and a pink flower and three 
green leaves made of marzipan. 



80 The Something-Different Dish 

To make fondant icing. Put three pounds of 
sugar into a saucepan, add two cupfuls of cold 
water, and stir over the fire until the sugar is dis- 
solved. Then add one tablespoonful of glucose, 
and allow it to boil until it forms a soft ball in 
cold water. Let the bubbles die down, and pour 
into a basin which has been rinsed out with cold 
water. When you can bear your finger in the 
middle, begin to cream it, and when thick, put 
your hands in and knead and squeeze until it is 
a solid, firm, creamy mass. Then flavor and color 
it and it is ready for use. 

To make marzipan icing: Mix in a basin ten 
ounces of fondant with eight ounces of ground 
almonds. Boil two cupfuls of sugar with two cup- 
fuls of water to soft ball. During the boiling 
add a pinch of cream of tartar and one table- 
spoonful of almond extract, then pour it quickly 
on to the ingredients in basin. Get some one to 
hold the basin firmly for you, while with a wooden 
spoon you stir as quickly as you can as the mass 
begins to harden; turn out on to a clean baking-

board and knead and roll until it is smooth. 
Color it while it is warm. It will keep for three 
weeks. Should it be too hard when you want to 
work it, add a few drops of lukewarm water and 
knead it, or roll it out with a rolling-pin until it 
becomes soft and pliable.

Sally Lunn was a Bath celebrity who, at the

which was a favorite resort for both youth and 
age in the old West of England country town. 
Sally originally carried out her cakes, morning 
and evening, in a basket with a white cover. 
Later her small shop on Lilliput Alley became a 
favorite haunt, and Dalmer, a baker and musician, 
seeing that it was a very good thing, bought the 
business, composed a song about the cakes and 



92 The Something-Different Dish 

set it to music. This song became a popular 
street ditty, and barrows were used to distribute 
the now celebrated cakes.

ioo The Something-Different Dish 

into the prepared cake tin, smooth it over the 
top, and bake in a steady oven until well risen 
and firm to the touch. 

When cold place the almond paste on the top. 
Sometimes a layer of almond paste is put in the 
middle of this cake. When this is desired, one- 
half of the almond paste should be made before 
the cake is baked, and this should be made in a 
round the size of the cake tin, and laid in the middle 
of the mixture before baking. 

To make the almond paste, mix one pound of 
ground almonds with one-half pound of granu- 
lated sugar, one-half pound of confectioners' 
sugar, the strained juice of half a lemon, one table- 
spoonful of vanilla extract, one tablespoonful of 
almond extract and enough egg to bind all to- 
gether. Either yolks or whites of eggs may be 
used; the yolks will make the paste yellower and 
richer, the whites drier, and of a paler color. 
Whole eggs may be used if it is more convenient. 
The paste ought to be just moist enough to be 
bound together. 

Simnel cake has a legendary history: Long 



Cakes 101 

ago an old couple were making their cake for 
Mothering Sunday, when the children would 
return home for the Mid-Lent holiday. Why the 
old man meddled with the cake-making nobody 
tells, but so determined was he that it should be 
boiled, and so determined was his wife that it 
should be baked, they came to a quarrel. Finally 
they decided to split the difference by boiling it 
half the time and baking it the other half. The 
old man's name was "Sim," the old lady's 
"Nelly"; and the cake is called "Simnel" in 
honor of both. Simnel cake today is always 
baked, proving that no man has any right to 
interfere in the affairs of the kitchen.

SALMAGUNDI 

1 pint (2 cups) chopped Few sprigs parsley 

cooked veal, ham or 1 lemon 

chicken yi pint (1 cup) olive oil 

4 hard-cooked eggs 1 teaspoonful salt 

yi pint (1 cup) chopped 1 teaspoonful dry mus- 

olives or pickles tard 

Divide the yolks from the whites of the eggs 
and rub them through a sieve. Put a layer of the 
meat on a platter, then a layer of whites of eggs, 
then a layer of the olives, a layer of the yolks of 
eggs, another layer of meat and the parsley on 
the top. 

Beat up the olive oil with the strained juice of 
the lemon, season with the salt and mustard and 
serve with the salmagundi. 

Salmagundi probably never appears on a mod- 
ern menu, although it could describe a dish of 
engaging qualities. What is salmagundi? The 
dictionary says it was originally a dish consisting 



120 The Something-Different Dish 

of chopped cooked meat, eggs, anchovies, onions, 
oil, etc. And in the second definition it is set 
forth that the dish may be a mixture of various 
ingredients; an olio or a medley; a hotch-potch; 
a miscellany. Etymologists derive the word from 
the Italian salame, meaning "salt meat," and 
conditti, derived from the Latin conditus, meaning 
"seasoned." 

It is generally conceded that the dish has an 
Italian origin, and that is not surprising, for Italy 
may be regarded as the cradle of good cookery. 
France soon followed the lead of Italy in culinary 
matters, and in spite of the conservatism of Eng- 
lish cooks many innovations were made in their 
cookery. Thus "salmagundi" was one of the 
dishes adopted from France. 

It seems to be composed of ingredients which 
have no gastronomic affinity, and yet the dish, 
when evolved (by inspiration, so to speak), is 
worth the approval of our best diners. The dish 
gives large scope for inventiveness. Minced 
chicken, veal or other insipid meat may form the 
foundation, while the seasonings or garnishings 



Miscellaneous Recipes 121 

may be without number. In Smollett's "Roder- 
ick Random" we read: "The descendant of 
Caractacus returned, and, ordering the boy to 
bring a piece of salt beef from the brine, cut off a 
slice and mixed it with an equal quantity of onions, 
which, seasoning with a moderate proportion of 
pepper and salt, he brought into a consistence 
with oil and vinegar; then, tasting the dish, as- 
sured us it was the best salmagundi that he had 
ever made." 

One of Washington Irving's books goes by the 
name of "Salmagundi." The name is appro- 
priate, for the subjects contained therein are as 
varied as were the ingredients which formed this 
once popular dish. A salmagundy (this mode 
of spelling the word is the consensus of the 
majority of cookery book writers) was a hotch- 
potch of cold viands, such as chicken, veal, hard- 
cooked eggs, herrings, parsley, beets, pickled 
cabbage, etc., arranged in appetizing order. 
According to the old books there was no limit 
fixed to the number of good things which might 
enter into the composition of a salmagundy, and 



122 The Something-Different Dish 

certainly there was no limit to the variations of 
its orthography. Some etymologists trace it to 
Sal Magundy, a lady in waiting on Mary Queen 
of Scots, who possessed an old-fashioned appetite 
for the dish, and who perhaps, invented it; others 
to Mary's habit of asking her attendant Gundy 
to pass the salt when she partook of the dish, and 
desired "Sel, ma Gundy." Thus two methods of 
spelling are possible according to the etymological 
theory accepted, but Salmagundie, Solomongon- 
din, and Solomongundy are but a few of the other 
varieties which may be met with.
