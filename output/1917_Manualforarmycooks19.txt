MAHCAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 



Chapter No. 1. 

DEFINITIONS. 

1. Aerated bread. — Bread resulting from a dough into which 
carbonic ga8 is mechanically introduced, in order to save the starch, 
which is otherwise lost as a result of yeast fermentation. 

2. Albumen. — The transparent nitrogenous substance which forma 
the chief and characteristic constituent of white of an egg. Albumen 
is found also in blood, in all serous fluids, and in many animal and 
vegetable juices and solids. 

3. Allspice. — A common spice (the berry of a West Indian tree) 
used in mincemeat, brown cakes, pudding, soups, game entr^s, 
and gellatin jellies. Ground or whole, it is used in pickling pigs* 
feet, tripe, sweet pickles, etc. It is supposed to combine the flavors 
of cinnamon, nutmeg, and cloves; hence the name. 

4. Ambergris. — A waxy substance obtained from the intestines of 
the sperm whale. It is much used in flavoring liquors and in per- 
fumes, 

5. Aniline. — Dye used in highly colored confectionery. A product 
of petroleum. The red shades are harmless, but the chemicals used 
in making blue, green, and other colors are injurious. 

6. Aniseed. — A small seed used for flavoring. Resembles caraway 
seed or celery seed. 

7. Annatto.— A yellowish-red dye used in coloring cheese, butter, 
silk, and varnish. Obtained from a tropical tree. 

8. Arrow root. — The starch of the root of a West Indian plant. It 
is very similar to sago and to tapioca. It is frequently made into a 
gruel for the sick, but is little used in the company. So called from 



8 MANUAL FOE ABMT COOKS. 

the reputed use of it by the natives to heal wounds from poisoned 
arrows. 

9. Baking. — Cooking in a dry heat, as in a closed oven. 

10. Baking powder. — A mixture of a carbonate of soda and an acid 
reagent (as cream of tartar, phosphoric acid, or some form of alum) 
together with a small quantity of starch or other material to keep the 
active agents better separated. The acid and the carbonate com- 
bine when mixed with water, liberating carbonic acid gas, which, in 
rising, forms in pockets or cells in the dough, making it Ught and 
spongy. Cold water or cold milk should be used in the mixture, 
which should be disturbed as Uttle as possible after the baking powder 
has been added. The dough should be baked as soon as possible 
after being prepared, or it should be set in a cool place until the oven 
is ready. The objection to the use of backing powder is that, as a 
result of the chemical reaction, certain eolids are left in the bread, 
cake, etc., which are more or less injurious, but they produce no 
harmful results if used in limited quantities. The exclusive use of 
baking powder bread is impracticable as it turns against the stomach. 
Compare with yeast. 

11. Baking temperature. — Generally stated as 385° F., though 
bread may safely be baked at a somewhat higher or lower tempera- 
ture, between about 300° and 450° F. Many other articles are baked 
at much lower temperatures. 

12. Barbecue. — To roast or broil whole. Or an entertainment for 
"which the carcass of an animal, as a hog, is roasted or broiled whole. 

13. Basil. — One of the standard pot herbs of the mint family. 
Much used in turtle soup. 

14. Baste. — Sometimes to sprinkle, as with pepper or salt; gener- 
ally to dash or pour a liquid over with a spoon, as in the case of 
gravy or stock in baking or roasting. 

15. Batter. — A thick liquid mixture of two or more materials 
beaten together to be used in cooking or baking. 

16. Bay leaves. — Leaves of the cherry laurel. Much used in 
soups and st«ws and in pickling. 

17. Beef extract. — This is really a concentrated beef stock, ^ ex- 
tracted by boiling beef under pressure. It contains very little 
nutritive matter — much less than is found in an equivalent weight 
of beef. It is of especial value on account of the ease and speed 



MANUAL FOB ARMY COOKS. tf 

with which it may become absorbed into the circulation. It holds 
an important place in the diet of the sick and convalescent. 

18. Beef juice, — The liquid remaining in fresh beef after it is prop- 
erly prepared for consumption, the blood ha\dng been removed. 
The juice may be removed by pressure, or by cutting into small 
pieces and placing in cold water. The juice having been drawn out, 
the water is evaporated. Much of the so-called beef juice on the 
market is said to be prepared from the blood of slaughtered animals 

19. Beef tea. — This is really unfiltered beef stock. Instead of 
constantly skimming the surface of the stock, the coagulated albumen 
is allowed to remain. It should be made of the best meat. One- 
half pound of good beef tea may be made from 1 pound of meat and 
1 quart of water. It has little real nutritive value, but, like the 
beef extract, is a light stimulant. 

20. Bench. — A molding table. 

21. Bisk (or bisque). — A shellfish soup. 

22. Blanch. — To scald vegetables, nuts, etc., in order to remove 
the outside skins or hulls. 

23. Blood heat. — The normal temperature of the human body, 
98° F. 

24. Boiling. — The conversion of a liquid into eteam by the appli- 
cation of suffiqient heat to cause ebullition or disturbance of the 
surface. As applied to cooking, it is heating or cooking in a boiling 
liqmid. (See Methods of Cooking.) 

Water boila at 212° F. at the sea level. It simmers when the 
bubbles break beneath the surface — 185° F. It is scalding hot at 
150° F., or at a temperature such that the hand can not be borne 
in it. Salt water boils at 224° F. Other solids, as, for example, 
sugar, also raise the boiling point of water. A solution having reached 
the boiling point, the temperature can not be increased by anv 
amount of additional heat, except under pressure, as would result 
from boiling in a closed vessel. 

Lard smokes at 385° F. and boils at about 600° F. Hence it is 
evident that grease, even if not at the smoking or boiling point, may 
be much hotter than boiling water, a fact that should always be 
borne in mind in handling it and in cooking. 

25. Bouillon. — A clear meat broth or soup rich in extractives. 

i26. Brains. — The brains of most slaughtered animals are used for 
•food and are considered a luxury. Calves' brains are considered 



10 MANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 

the beat, although there ia but little difference, and all brains are 
generally sold under this name. 

27. Braising. — Method of combining the roasting and stewing; of 
meat in a closed vessel with heat from both top and bottom, as in a 
Dutch oven. It is one of the best methods or cooking tough, lean 
meat. If the kettle is placed in a slow oven, it requires little further 
attention. 

28. Broiling. — Properly speaking, it is cooking over red-hot coals 
by direct exposure to the heat of an open fire, though the term ia 
applied to cooking on an iron plate interposed laetween the fire and 
the article cooked. In broiling, the fire should be clear and free 
from smoke. Charcoal Is the best fuel to use. It is better to broil 
before a fire than over it, in order to save the dripping grease and 
avoid the smoky flavor, though the smoke from the fat itself is not 
as objectionable as that from coal or wood. 

29. Calorie. — Quantity of heat required to raise 1 kilogram of 
water 1° C. This is the equivalent of 1,54 foot tons. Food values 
are expressed in calories and the calories in the soldier's daily ration 
exceed 5,000. 

30. Capers. — Unopened buds of a trailing shnib grown in southern 
Europe. Pickled and much uesd in sauces. Caper sauce is fre- 
quently served with mutton, 

31. Caramel. — A sirup made from scorched sugar, used largely in 
coloring sauces, as well as in flavorings. 

32. Caraway seed. — Seed of a garden herb. Grows like the seed 
of a carrot or parsnip. Used in various cakes and sweet crackers, in 
rye bread, and in liquors. 

33. Carbohydrates. — Starches, surars, and the fibers of plants. It 
is principally a source of energy. The surplus is stored in the body 
as fat. 

34. Casein. — A proteid compound found principally in milk, of 
which it is the most important ingredient, ^^^len coagulated, it 
forms the principal ingredient in cheese, 

35. Casing. — A term applied to the intestines of all animals. 
They are used to receive sausage, bologna, etc. The hog's stomach 
ia actually used as a receptacle for his head when it is converted into 
head cheese, 

36. Cassia. — Bark of a tree similar to cinnamon. Cultivated in 
€l]dna. Also called Chinese cinnamon. 



MANUAL FOB ABMT COOKS. 11.

39. Chervil. — A garden herb much used in soups. 

40. Chicory. — A perennial herb of the astor farnilys with heads of 
irge bright-blue flowers and dandelion-like roots. The roasted and 
ilverized root is used in adulterating coffee and as a substitute for it. 

I grains of coffee containing chicory are dropped into cold water, 
,e chicory will settle at once and be followed by a cloudy streak. 

41. Chili. — Red sweet pepper. Chili powder conta,iB.s' chili, ga.T- 
j, comina, and ore^no. 

i42. Chives. — A kind of green onion. Tops are slender and pipe 
ke. Much used in soups and sauces.

rown in Ceylon and used as a spice. 

47. Citron. — Large coarse fruit of the lemon family. Used in 
incemeat and preserves. 

48. Cloves. — Flower buds of the clove tree carefully picked and 
ded . Should always be purchased whole, as they deteriorate rapidly 
tien ground. 

49. Cochineal. — Coloring matter made from the dried bodies of 
lall insects found in the jiouthwestem part of the United States, in 
exico, and in Central America. It is harmlo.><s. 

50. Cocoa.— Similar to chocolate, but not as rich. It is ground 
am the cocoa bean after much of the fat ha.s been pressed out. 

51. Comina. — An herb found in the southwestern part of the 
oited States and in Mexico. Much used in seasoning soups and 

3WS. 

52. Compound. — A substitute for lard, commonly used in bakeries, 
about the following composition: Seventy-five per cent cottonseed 
I, 25 per cent beef stearin. The results obtained are about the same 



12 MANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 

as when using lard, and its use in company kitchens is recommended 
for economy. 

53. Condiment. — Something to give relish to the food and gratify 
the taste. General term for seasoning. 

54. Cracklings.— The crisp residue of hog fat after the lard has been 
tried out. It may be used in hash or com bread, but is valuable only 
in proportion to the amount of fat that is left in it. 

55. Crackling bread.— Com bread to which cracklings have been 
a,dded. 

56. Cream bread. — Bread baked in superheated steam, as when 
moisture is artificially introduced into an oven, or the bread baked 
under inverted pans, giving a very thin crust and a light color. 

57. Croquettes. — A mass of finely minced and seasoned meat, fish, 
rice, or potatoes, etc., made into a ball or other regular shape, rolled 
in cracker crumbs and fried in deep lard until crisp. 

58. Croutons.— Cubes of toasted bread. Generally served with 
soup.

fried in deep lard. They may be made with either baking powder 
or yeast. 

60. Crumb. — The soft inner part of the loaf, as distinguished from

lamb, veal, venison, etc., but not of beef. 

63. Deviled. — EQghly seasoned. 

64. Deviled meat. — Cooked meat, finely ground and highly seas- 
oned. 

65. Dough. — Technically, the mixture resulting from breaking up 
a sponge and adding the remainder of the flour and other ingredients 
to be used in making bread. The term is also applied to the result- 
ing mixture in any subsequent stage, and sometimes to any mixture 
in which flour forms the greater part. 

Young or green dough.— One not fully matured, or not yet risen to 
its maximum height in proving. 

Ripe dough. — One that has fully matured. 



MANUAL FOE ABMY COOKS. 13 

Old and rotten dough.— One that has been allowed to stand longer 
tian the normal length of time, so that it begins to show signs of 
ourness In pulling a portion from the general mass, it will tear 
aore readily than usual, on account of the gluten having become 
reaken^d by the actions of acids upon it. e -j 

Sour <?oua)i.— Generally one containing a large percentage of and, 
<n account of being allowed to ferment without the introduction of 
reast A sour dough may also result from unclean utensils, from 
)roving in too high a temperature, from too long fermentation, or 
rom yea-st containing acid germs. 

66. Dough break.— A dough kneading machine with corrugated 

67 Doughnuts.— Small cakes made from a dough mixture and

with flour, etc. . •,£_•. 

69 Dumplings.— Pieces of dough, sometimes with fruit or vege- 
tables inclosed; boiled or baked . If to be served with meats or stews, 
Jhe pieces of dough should be dropped into the boiling hot beef stock 
3r stew about eight minutes before being served. ^ 

70 Eggs.— For domestic purposes eggs should be kept m a cool, 
iark place, the nearer to the freezing point the better. However, 
changes are constantly taking place within the egg, producing a 
certain amount of heat, and, partly for this reason, eggs will stand a 
temperature somewhat lower than freezing. ^ , 

The porous nature of the shell facilitates decomposition, and eggs 
dipped in varnish or other solution (e. g., silicate of soda) that will 
permanently fill the pores, will keep much longer than others. Even 
^ cold-storage eggs " should not be kept longer than six weeks. 1 hey 
are, however, often kept for a period of six months, or even more, 
but during this time they acquire a distinctly unpleasant (xior and 
flavor. Eggs kept for a long time in cold storage, or decayed in any 
way, are extremely injurious. . • i. a

cooking to "bring out" the flavor of other seasonings. 

90. Garnish.— To decorate a dish with something to make it more 
attractive, such as bordering salads with capers, parsley, beets, or 
lemons, 

91. Qelatin. — Glutinous material obtained from animal tissues 
after long boiling. It readily dissolves in hot water, and forms a

has been remove.d. 

• 106. Hops. — Used in the preparation of yeast, not as a food for 
the yeast plant but to prevent sourness. 

107. Ice. — A general term frequently applied to frozen creams,- 
custards, and other desserts, as well as to water ices. The latter are 
frtiit juices sweetened with sugar sirup and stirred while freezing. 

108. Icing. — A glazing or coating of sugar usuallj^ mixed with 
white of egg and suitable flavoring, as on a cake ; frosting. 

109. Jam. — A preserv^e of fruit boiled with sugar and water. 

110. Jelly. — The juice of fruits or meats boiled to an elastic con- 
sistence. In making fruit jellies, sugar and suitable flavor are added. 

111. Elidneys from all slaughtered animals are used in stews, etc. 
There is not any great demand for them in American markets, but 
great quantities are shipped abroad. Pig's kidneys are considered 
the best. 

112. Lamb chops. — The short ribs of lamb with the attached 
flesh. 

113. Lard. — The fat of swine. It is frequently adulterated by 
the addition of a large proportion of cottonseed oil. Pure cottonseed 
oil, to which stearin is added, makes a fairly good substitute. In 
addition, lard and cottonseed -oil compounds are frequently further 
adulterated by the addition of water, the presence of which is noted 
by the crackhng and sputtering when placed in the spider, or when 
a small lump is dropped into the fire. Watered lard is unnaturally 
white. Good firm lard is the best for pastries, although refined oil 
and "lard compounds" do for most purposes. 

114. Lard. — ^To introduce thin pieces of pprk, ham, or bacon into 
meats deficient in fat to improve the flavor. 

115. Leaf lard. — This consists of the leaves of fat along the back- 
bone of the hog, in the abdominal cavity. It may be torn out 
without cutting. It is the best quality of lard and may be used 
in many instances without rendering if desired. The next best 
quality of lard is that which is found connected with the intestines, 
called "intestinal lard," and the third quality comes from the 
back of the hog. 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 17

119. Lights. — The lungs of slaughtered animals. Used to some 
extent in cheap sausage. 

120. Liver.— -Calves' livers are considered the best. Beef liver 
is second best, and pigs' liver third. The liver of mutton is very 
dry and tasteless. 

121. Macaroni. — ^A strong flour made into a stiff dough, pressed 
into long tubes, and dried in the sun or by slow heat. Spaghttti 
is of the same material, but is pressed into the form of long cords. 
Vermicelli is the same as fine cord soaghetti. 

122. Mace. — ^The inner coating of the nutmeg. It is a good 
flavoring for meats, cream soups, puddings, and sweets. 

123. Malt. — Barley or other grain that has been allowed to sprout, 
then dried at a low temperature and coarsely ground. Useful in 
making yeast, as it furnishes food for the yeast plant in the best 
form possible. 

124. Marjoram. — A mintlike plant, particularly aromatic and 
fragrant. Much used in seasonings. 

125. Marrow. — The material filling the hollow of bones. The

Chopped green mint, vinegar, and sugar mixed. Served with 
mutton, either hot or cold. 

129. Mousse. — Froth. Something light and spongy. Term ap- 
plied both to meat preparations and ice cream.

130. Mulligatawny. — Curry soup (combination of two words from 
a foreign Iang:uage, meaning pepper w^ter). 

131. Mustard. — Flour made of mixed black and white mustard 
seeds, deprived of their oil and toned down with more or less meal. 

132. Noodles. — ^Practically the same material aa macaroni and 
spaghetti. (Seepaf. J21.)

the black pepper from seeds picked before they are ripe. White pep- 
per is much better for cooking purposes, as it does not show the dark

seasoning meats and stews. 

161. Sago. — It is made from the pith of a palm tree which grows in 
the East Indies. It is nearly pure starch and has many imitations

cooking. It is cooked in the same way as tapioca and is also much 
used in soups.

In the course of preparation, they are generally subjected to the 
smoke from hickory or other hard wood, and then cooked in vats of 
water at a temperatiu-e of about 160°, from 10 minutes for frankfurters 
to Z hours ioT bung saiisages. 

Summer sausages are first smoked and then placed in a drying tem- 
perature for about three months. The material put into sausages 
compares favorably with that put on the market in other forms. 

Bull meat is used to considerable extent, as it takes up more mois- 
ture than other meats. 

The best -pork sausage contains no beef. 

Liver sausage is one of the cheapest and contains lungs (lights) as 
well as Hver and other ingredients not put into better grades. 

A good quality may contain from one-third to one-half of beef, and 
for Army sausage, this is an ordinary proportion. 

164. Saut6. — To fry in a shallow pan with but a little fat — first on 
one side and then on the other. 

165. Scald. — As applied to floui, potatoes, etc., to submerge or wet

grains composing it generally to the action of the yeast plant. 

To scald utensils, etc.; to dash over with boiling water. 

166. Scallop. — A mollusk similar to an oyster. The shell is corru- 
pted and radiates from the center. Scalloped dishes. — Dishes made 
in the form of a scallop shell.

water, and yeast. It is the first step in the process of bread making. 
A sponge is said to be green or young before it has fully matured ; ripe 
when it has matured and is ready to be broken up preparatory to 
making the dough; and old or rotten when it has passed the ripe 
stage, and having risen and fallen more than once, probably contains 
a relatively high percentage of acid, making it sour. ' 

177 . Stale bread. — Bread in which all free moisture has so combined 
with the crumb as to give it the appearance of dryness. This takes 
place when the bread is from 18 to 24 hours old. 

178. Starch. — A white, odorless, tasteless, flourlike compound, 
insoluble in cold water, alcohol, and other liquids. Found in all 
grains and seeds of plants, with but few exceptions. It is readily 
transformed into sugar compounds. 

179. Stearin. — That portion of fats, lard, suet, etc., that gives it 
BoUdity. 

180. Sterilize.— To destroy harmless or disease-bearing bacteria. 
Generally accomplidied in the utensils used in the kitchen by the 
use of boiling hot water to which lye is sometimes added. The 
sterilizing of all utensils used in handling yeasts and doughs is abso- 
lutely necessary in order to prevent souring. 



22^ MANUAL FOB ARMY COOKS.

sidered a delicacy. Those from the calf are the best, the next are 
from the beef, sheep, and hog, in the order named. 

J 85. Tallow. — Properly speaking, it is the fat of beef, sheep, or 
other animals, from which a portion of the oil has been extracted,

used as sweet bread. 

189. Tripe. — A term applied to the stomach of the beef after being 
cleaned and boiled. It has but little flavor, but is considered by 
many as a very valuable food. It is very easily digested. 

190. Vinegar. — The sour liquid formed by the spontaneous acetic 
fermentation or artificial oxidation of beer, wine, cider, etc. 

191 . Yeast. — Yeast grows in small spores that reproduce themselves 
every foiu" of five hours. The spore is found ever vwhere floating 
about in the air, and wherever the proper condition of food, moisture, 
and warmth are found it grows spontaneously. "VMiile in a dry state 
it is unaffected by the ordinary temperature, though freezing or a 
temperature above 160° F. will kill it in the liquid state, ^\'hile it 
"works" or grows it evolves a carbonic gas which gives to the dou^h 
a cellular structure. "WTiile proving, the dough Siould l)e kept m 
an even temperature of about 80°, and this should be about the aver- 
age temperature of the dough and ingredients when mixed together. 



Chapter II. 



THE GABBISON RATION. 

192. A ration is the allowance for the subsistence of one person fo» 
one day. The garrison ration is intended for troops in gamson, and, 
in time of peace, for troops in maneuver camps; the ration to be 
issued to troops on the march in time of peace will be prescribed by 
I the commander, and will not exceed the allowance prescribed for the 
garrison ration- the travel ration is for troops traveling otherwise 
than by marching and separated from cooking facllties; the reserve 
ration is carried on the person of the men and m the trains, and con- 
stitutes the reserve for field service; the Jield ration is the ration 
prescribed in orders by the commander of the field forces; the 
Filipino ration is for use of the Philippine Scouts; and the einergency 
ration for troops in active campaign for use on occasions of emergency 
or in the fiela for purposes of instruction. 

In time of war when Philippine Scouts are serving in the field 
they will be subsisted the same as are Regular troops. \Mien imprac- 
ticable for Philippine Scouts to use the Filipino ration while traveling 
otherwise than by marching, on account of the lack of cooking facili- 
ties or for other reasons, the travel ration may l)e prescribed. 

The kinds and quantities of the component articles of the Army 
ration and the substitutive equivalent articles which may be Issued 
in place of such component shall be as follows:

in garrison, varied by the substitution of other articles of authorized subsistence 
stores, the total daily cost per man of the food consumed not to exceed 20 per cent 
more than the current cost of the garrison ration, except on Thanksgiving Day and

Scout organizations will be required to use the entire allowance 
of the meat component, and not more than 16 ounces of rice per 
day to be used for each ration. The purchase of 1.6 ounces of 
beans per ration in substitution of the portion of the rice ration 
not drawn will be made, and use of as large an extent as possible 
of native products, such as camotes, mongos, and squash, will be 
required. 



28 MANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 

6. EMERGENCY RATION. 

The emergency ration is furnished, in addition to the regular 
ration, as required for troops on active campaign or in the field for 
purposes of instruction, and will not be opened except by order cf 
an officer or in extremity, nor used \men regular rations are 
obtainable. 

Ration returns upon which emergency rations are drawn will 
bear the certificate of the organization commander that such rations 
are required for the enlisted men of his organization and that the 
money value of any rations previously drawn by him, and improp- 
erly opened or lost, has been charged against the person responsible. 

Company and detachment commanders are responsible for the 
proper care and use of emergency rations carried on the person of 
the soldier. 

All articles of the garrison, travel, or Filipino ration due a company 
or other organization will be retained by the quartermaster and 
credit given to the organization for the money value of these articles 
at the current price of the articles, and the quartermaster will pay 
as savings to the organization conmianders any excess in value of 
the stores so retained over those purchased by the organization. 
Such savings diall be used solely for the purchase of articles of food. 

Wifen on the march in time of peace a daily issue of rations will 
be made in the manner prescribed in the Field Service Regulations 
ior the time of war. The ration to be issued to troops on the march 
in time of peace will be prescribed by the commander, and will 
not exceed the allowances prescribed for the garrison ration. 

In time of peace the ration savings" privilege will be suspended 
for troops on the march, except that wnen so ordered by the com- 
mander the savings privilege will be allowed on certain specified 
articles of the ration. 

Upon arrival of troops at mobilization or concentration camps the 
ration savings privilege will be suspended and entirely replaced 
by issue of rations in kind. This same restriction also applies 
during the period of field operations. 

The commanding officer will designate the periods for which 
ration returns are to be submitted. Immediately upon the receipt 



MANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 29 

of a ration return by the quartermaster duly signed and approved 
he will enter it, together with the actual cost of the ration as com- 
puted on the back of the ration and savings account. The stwes 
required will be purchased from the quartermaster on charge sales 
slips, in the name of the organization, agairilst their credit shown 
on the account. At the end of the month, or whenever necessary, 
the organization commander will settle the account with the quar- 
termaster, when the savings due the organization, or the amount 
due the quartermaster, as the case may be, will be paid and the 
account certified as required. 

AU articles of the ration required for the supply of troops will be 
obtained from the quartermaster when on hand, but if any article 
be not in stock a temporary supply may be purchased elsewhere. 

When necessary to renew reserve rations or to avoid loss of ration 
articles that have accumulated, the quartermaster will report the 
facts to the commanding general or the commanding officer, as the 
case may be, who, if he considers it necessary to prevent loss, will 
give in writing the neces^ry orders looking to the issue of such 
supplies to troops. Such issues will not exceed th§ ration allow- 
ance and will be continued until the surplus is exhausted or until 
such other action as may seem advisable can be taken to protect 
the interest of ^he Government. 

193. On account of the variation in the cost of the ration in 
different localities, the ration and savings account should be settled 
upon departure from a post, to include the last day for which rations 
are taken. Upon arrival at a new station a new account is opened 
and credit given at the prevailing price at the new sta.don, thus 
avoiding any pecuniar^' loss through having to purchase articles 
of the ration at prices higher than those upon which the credit 
allowance was computed, 

RATION TABLES. 

194. The cash value of the garrison and travel ration is determined

195. After securing a price list of ration articles from the quarter- 
master for the ensuin? month, the mess sergeant should consult the 
preceding table in order to fix in his mind the quantities and value 
of the different ration articles he will make use of and the amounts 
he wiU leave to the credit of the organization. 



MANUAL FOR ABMY COOKS.

He should make a saving on the beef component in order to pur- 
chase liver, hearts, fish, pork, chicken, etc. 

From the savings on flour he should purchase prepared breakfast 
food and oatmeal. 

From the savings on potatoes he should purchase cabbage, sweet 
potatoes, turnips, and fresl^ vegetables in season. 

A proper use of the bean component will enable him to purchase* 
lima beans and other varieties of beans, often cheaper than the issue 

The savings on prunes (dried fruit) may be used when the different 
fresh fruits are available to supply a change. 

The stock on hand in the storeroom must be considered in order 
that the total on hand will not exceed the requirements for the period 
for which drawn. . 

The mess sergeant is able with ease to purchase quantities suffi- 
cient to run the mess for given periods without having an excesa 
amount of stock on hand at the end of the ration period. This wilk 
often prevent his organization from being in debt after the inventory 
of subsistence stores near the end of the month. 

19C. The preceding table should be memorized by the mess ser- 
geant and the cooks, in order that they maj^ know the componenta 
on which the cash allowance is based. While under ordinary con- 
ditions in garrison or permanent camp the organization may be on 
the cash allowance, the regulations provide for an issue in kind while 
on the march or in the field. 

197. The following table is of especial assistance to the mess ser- 
[ geant when rations are it-sued in kiiid:

HOW TO KEEP WITHIN THE LIMITS OF THE CREDIT ALLOWANCE OF THE 
GARRISON RATION DAY BY DAY. 



198. Due to the fact that the monthly inventory of subsistence 
stores is taken at any time from the 23d to the 27th of the month, 
it is almost impossible for the organization commander to keep an 
accurate check on his ration allowance. For example, the date 6f 
this inventory may vary one day in an organization of 100 men, 



38 MANUAL FOB ARMY COOKS. 

increasing or diminishing by about $25 the cash credit of the organi- 
zation for that month. 

The ration return is usually submitted on the first day of each 
month, based on the strength of the organization aa shown by the 
morning report of the last' day of the preceding month. The addi- 
tions or deauctions for the preceding month are credited or deducted 
on this ration return. 

If the number of men fed during the month remained constant, the 
mess sergeant could base his expenditures on his cash credit for the 
month. But as this' number changes from day to day, the amount 
expended each day should be based on the actual number rationed 
that day. 

It frec^uently happens that the mess sergeant fails to allow for the 
changes in the number of men he feeds during the month and bases his. 
expenditures on his ration allowance computed by the quarter- 
master from his last ration return. Thus, if the strength of the 
company is 70 men and the month has 30 days and the value of the 
ration is 25 cents, his ration return will call for 2,100 rations, or $525. 
If he has to prepare 200 additional rations during the month, he 
should allow nis company $575 instead of $525. On the other hand, 
if there is a reduction in the number of men fed, causing a deduction 
of 200 rations prepared during the month, he should allow his com- 
pany $475 instead of $525. If he does not allow for this deduction, 
he will find it necessary to reduce his allowance per man the follow- 
ing month so as to avoid running into debt. Thus, it happens that 
the mess sergeant frequently feeds the company bountifully one 
month and scantily the next, because he considers his credit with 
the quartermaster for that month instead of his daily allowances aa 
shown bjr the morning report. 

For tms reason it is better to run the mess on a daily cash basis 
computed from the strength of the organization present each day 
as shown by the morning report. 

The sergeant computes the cash value of a ration for the current 
month as per table in paragraph 194 or obtains the same from the 
Quartermaster. Each day he computes the cash allowance for that 
aay and takes care to see that the cooks do not exceed it or that 
they exceed it only when a saving has previously been made to 
cover the excess. 



MANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 39 

If in the field, on the march, or at mobilization camps, it will be 
necessary for the command to subsist on the ration in kind. The 
mess sergeant should each day compute the allowance of the com- 
ponents authorized in orders for the number of men present for rations 
carried on the morning report of the organization. Care should be 
taken to see that this allowance is not exceeded for that day in the 
preparation of the bill of fare, except when a saving has previously 
oeen made. 

The table in paragraph 197 will prove useful in computing this 
allowance in kind when drawing or issuing, on the march or in mobi- 
lization camps. 

The general scheme of figuring the bill of fare one day ahead should 
be followed, and in doing this the ingredients to be used in the various 
dishes for each meal should be set down on a memorandum or scratch 
pad and an accurate record kept of the value of all articles used for 
the bill of fare. See copy of scratch pad memorandum in connection 
with the following bill of fare. 

This method will at first appear irksome and unnecessary', but it is 
the only positive method of keeping track of the daily ration allow- 
ance either on a cash basis in garrison or when drawing rations in kind 
in the field, on marches, or in camp. 

The ingredients on the memorandum are copied on the bill of fare 
when the meal is prepared. The memorandum is then destroyed 
and the bill of fare serves as a voucher by means of which the com- 
pany commander checks the stores on hand. 

A model "Daily report" and a model ''Daily mess statement" are 
also shown on pages 28 and 29 A. 

The daily mess statement is the daily statement required of the 
orranization mess sergeant. See paragraph 270. 

The daily report is made up by the first sergeant and turned over to 
the mess sergeant each mormng. It shows the number of men to be 
present for the three meals — dinner, supper, and breakfast — and is 
filed by the mess sergeant as a voucher to the Daily mess statement. 
See first two lines top of Model daily mess statement, "Number of 
men in mess."

This slip to be prepared by the organization first sergeant for the 
mess sergeant by 8 a. m. 

A bill of fare based on the ration in kind can be readily prepared 
by consulting the table in paragraph 197, showing the Quantity of 
the different components and substitutive articles allowed per 
ration. The mess sergeant or cook can quickly ascertain the amounts 
of the different ingredients he should use for the da^. This table 
should be used on a cash basis as well as when drawing the ration 
in kind. This in order that there will be no confusion when sub- 
sisting under the different methods prescribed in orders. 

The various schools for bakers and cooks have blank forms for 
keeping mess accounts. These consist of bills of fare, stock sheets 
or daily mess statements, and daily reports. They can be secured 
upon application to the schools direct. 

The following bills of fare have been prepared as a general guide 
for winter and summer. They are merely offered as suggestions.

COMPONENTS OF THE RATION. 



199. Beef. — ^This component is dealt with in Chapter III. It is 
the most important as well as the most expensive article of the 
ration, its value being about equal to all the other components com- 
bined. It is the foundation of the ration and careless handling will 
soon put an organization in debt, while if it is handled carefully 
substantial savings may be made with which to purchase pork, 
chicken, and other meats not included in the ration. The organi- 
zation commander should pay particular attention to the beef and 
flour components, which taken together amount to more than one- 
half the value of the ration. 

200. Soup. — A good stock soup should be prepared daily for dinner 
and served in a course by itself, before the more substantial portion 
of the meal. Serve plenty of croutons or crackers with it, seeing 
that it is hot when served and that the grease is skimmed off. Soup 
stock should be made fresh every day or two. Cut the fresh meat 
into small pieces, break or saw the bones and place them together 
in cold water for several houre, then put on range and allow to 
slimmer for about six hours. After about two hours of simmering the 
juices will be extracted from the meat. The meat should then be 
removed from the boiler before the fibers have become hard and indi- 
gestible, and placed in a cool place for use in hash, meat balls, etc. 
The grease rises to the top and forms a crust which may easily be re- 
moved and placed in the drip pan . The stock when prepared should 
be poured into another receptacle and cooled. The stock boiler 
should then be cleaned out and a new start made. Beef stock is not 
only used in making soup, but in hash, stews, gravies, pot pies, etc. 

ITie.average cook doee not seem to realize that he has more oppor- 
tunity to show his skill in preparing a good appetizing soup than in 
most other dishes. Seasoning such as can be obtained from a judi- 
cious use of different kinds of pepper, celery, bacon, or parsley and a 
substantial filling of different vegetables will produce a dish which 
the men will enjoy as much as any part of the meal. 

201. Bread and flour. — This is the cheapest component of the 
ration, considering the nutritive value, and consequently the greater 
the quantity used, the less expensive will be the mess. At least 10 
per cent should be saved on this component after buying the flour 
and bread used in the kitchen. This saving should be used for the 



48 MANUAL FOB AEMY COOKS. 

purchase of breakfast foods for which no allowance is given. Bread 
should not be cut until just before it is to be used and then in thin 
slices, which should be piled close together in order to prevent it 
from drying out. It should be purchased in small quantities as 
required from day to day. Bread left over should be piled in the 
form of the loaf before it was cut, covered with a cloth, put in the 
bread box and served first at the next meal. All crumbs and pieces 
of dried bread not desirable for the table should be saved and placed 
in a flour sack and allowed to dry out. It may then be toasted and 
ground for use in place of cracker crumbs or in preparing croquettes, 
meat balls, etc. Milk toast and bread puddings should be served 
often enough to use up the remainder of the dried bread. 

The flour should be used in the preparation of biscuits, pancakes, 
hot rolls, and desserts. 

Bread and rolls that have dried out may be greatly freshened by 
-moistening and placing in a slow o^'en for half an hour. Place a 
moistened flour sack or dish towel in the bottom of a bake pan so 
that the ends may be folded over the bread or rolls, or place a pan 
•of boiling water in the bottom of the oven and the pan of b ^ead or 
rolls on the top shelf without a cloth, leaving the oven door on the 
isecond notch. The bread should be allowed to remain in a 20-count 
oven for about 20 minutes. 

Hard bread which is ordered sold to the troops to prevent its accu- 
mulating may be toasted and used in soups, chowder, bread pud- 
dings, etc. 

Com meal should be served occasionally as a mush, fried or in com 
bread. 

202. Baking powder. — The allowance is sufficient for one mess of 
pancakes, biscuits, etc, each day. Usually about one-half as much 
of a more expensive baking poVer is required. In using baking 
powder remember that it, with the other ingredients, should be 
mixed with cold water or milk and used at once. This is because 
the action of water on the ingredients in the powder causes the car- 
bonic gas, which makes the dough light and spongy, to form and 
escape. If the mixture is not used at once it should be kept cool, 
otherwise this gas will escape and the results will be unsatisfactory. 
The best rule is to use at once after mixing. 

, Recipe for baking powder. — A very good baking powder can be made 
as follows: Take 16 ounces of cream of tartar, 8 ounces baking soda. 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 49 

and 4 ounces of com starch and mix thoroughly by putting through 
a sieve at least nine times. 

203. The bean component is one of the most important. Beans 
and peas contain much muscle-building material and with the right 
proportion of fat added in the form of bacon (about 20 per cent), are 
equal to meat in food value, and are a suitable substitute for fresh 
beef. The variety of beans served should be as great as possible. 
The best results are obtained by soaking the beans three hours, pour- 

■ ing off the water, scalding them in a second water which is poured 
off, boiling them an hour in a third water, then allowing them to 
simmer until done. This gives the beans a more agreeable flavor 
than if the water is not changed. 

For an organization of 100 men the maximum amount of dried 
vegetables to be used in a 30-day period even during the season when 
fresh vegetables are not plentiful is as follows: 

Issue beans, 200 pounds. This is sufficient for five messes of baked 
beans, three messes of stewed beans, and three soups. 

Dried peas, 60 pounds. This will make three messes of stewed peas. 

Lima beans, 60 pounds. This is sufficient for three messes of stewed 
beans. 

Kidney beans, 45 pounds. This is sufficient for three messes of 
stewed beans. 

Chili beans, 50 pounds. This will furnish sufficient beans for two 
meals of chili con came and two of stewed beans. When served as a 
vegetable, add five pounds of bacon. 

Rice, about 70 pounds. This should supply three meals of boiled 
rice, three 6l curry and rice, and about two puddings and leave 
sufficient for soups. 

Dried sweet com, 40 pounds. This is sufficient for three messes 
of stewed corn and three of soup. It takes up very readily about 
twice its weight of water and can be prepared m about 50 minutes. 

Hominy, 30 pounds. This is sufficient for three messes. Should 
be served as a vegetable, boiled, with diced bacon added. It may 
be boiled and, when cold, sliced, fried, and served with sirup. 
The canned lye hominy is much enjoyed by the men when fried 
brown in ham or bacon fat and served at breakfast. 

204. Vegetables consist of potatoes, onions, and canned tomatoes. 
The allowance of vegetables is ample during the winter months. 



do MANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 

while during the season of fresh vegetables a considerable saving 
should be made. This saving may be used for the purchase of fresh 
garden truck, or when a company garden is provided should be 
added to the general mess fund. During the winter and early 
spring the mess will derive great benefit from the dried v^etables 
mentioned in the preceding paragraph. 

Onions and tomatoes are most valuable as seasoning components. 
They may be served as a vegetable about once in five days. To- 
matoes are chiefly used in soups and stews and onions in' Hamburg 
steaks, salads, etc. 

Potatoes should be stored in a cool dry place. Warmth and 
moisture hasten decay and promote the growth of sprouts. Sprouts 
should be removed as soon as they appear, as this growth exhausts 
the nutritive value of the potato. Aiter peeling and until used, 
the i)otato should be kept covered with cold water, exposure to 
the air causing them to become dark and tough. Fermentation is^ 
likely to start if the potatoes are left in warm water. Keep them 
cool. 

All potatoes left over should be used up in the form of fried pota- 
toes, in meat balls, hash, soups, and salads. 

All left-over vegetables should be cooled and placed in the ice 
box in warm weather. This applied to; potatoes, oeans, and salads 
in particular. Ferments thrive in temperatures above 70° F. 
The careless cook, may, through neglect, cause stomach trouble in 
warm weather. 

Cabbage is invaluable in the season when fresh vegetables can not 
be procured. It contains a certain per cent of sulphur and while 
cooking it should be submerged in water, which absorbs the sulphur. 

ParsnivSt tumipSy beets, and carrots are all valuable for .a change ' 
during tne winter months. If purchasing with the intention ofi 
storing for winter use they should be well matured; otherwise they' 
will not keep. 

205. Dried fruits. — Excellent recipes are given in this manual for' 
handling dried fruits, and the entire allowance should be consumed J 
in the mess unless fresh fruit is abundant and cheap enough to be 
purchased from the savings. The acids in fruit are desirable in a 
well regulated diet. The quantity of fruit allowed is based upon 
ordinary requirements. 



MANUAL FOB ARMY COOKS. 51 

The dried fruits issued are easily prepared for the table. The 
men tire of them when they are prepared as stews too often. They 
should be prepared as butter and used as fillings for pies, rolls, 
cobblers, plum duffs, etc. 

The following recipe, by Lieut. Col. Willdns, Quartermaster 
Corps, has furnished excellent results: 

1. Thoroughly wash the evaporated fruit in about three waters. 

2. Cover with plenty of water and soak over night. 

3. Stew slowly until tender. 

4. Rub through a colander and add to each pound of dried fruit 
used three-fourths of a pound of sugar, one teaspoonful of cloves, 
two teaspoonsful of cinnamon, and a little vinegar. 

206. Coffee. — The use of tea and coffee to the exclusion of water is 
a great mistake. The quantity of the coffee component consumed 
will be greatly reduced if plenty of cold water is placed on the 
cable where the men can help themselves. If good coffee is made 
uhe allowance is hardly sufficient. The use of tea, however, de- 
creases the consumption. 

Allow coffee to boil not over five minutes, then reduce to a simmer- 
ing temperature. Do not allow it to boil violently enough to permit 
the air to carry of the aroma which gives the coffee its agreeable 
llavor. If boiled for more than five minutes the tannic acid is ex- 
tracted and forms injurious compounds which irritate the membranes 
i)f the stomach. The grounds should not be allowed to accumulate 
:or more than three meal&^-better two — before the pot is scoured and 
cleaned. 

! ^ Tea is a very good substitute for coffee and shoidd be used for 
jiinner and supper, iced in summer. It has about the same physio- 
l(»ical effect as coffee, but is lighter and less bulky. 
j In preparing tea it is well to clean it by pouring over it boiling 
ivater, then put the leaves in boiling water and allow to draw for 
jibout five minutes just before serving. Do not allow to stand longer 
ijn the hot water. About three-fourths of an ounce per gallon of 
I i^ater is suflicient for strong tea, one-half ounce for medium strong. 
) i?ea should not be allowed to stand in tin vessels, even for a short 
I lime, on account of the action of tannic acid on the metal. 
1 i 207. Sugar is a cheap article of diet, considering its high nutritive 
-alue. Next to fat and oil it furnishes the most complete food for 
ueat and energy. It is a quick-acting food and relieves exhaustion 



52 MANUAL FOR ABMY COOKS. 

very rapidly. It should be placed on the table and the men should 
be allowed to help themselves. When this method is used the con- 
sumption will increase for a short time, but soon adjusts itself when 
properly sui)ervi8ed. The mess sergeant should take care to see that 
none is left in the bottom of the cups after the coffee is drunk. 

Granulated sugar makes an excellent sirup for table use; it is 
cheaper than other sirup and the men prefer it to cheap grades. 

208. Milk. — The allowance is based upon the requirements for 
coffee only. If used directly in the coffee there is sufficient for use 
twice daily. 

209. Seasonings. — Flavoring extracts. — The allowance is about 
sufficient, any excess used or savings made will affect the cash credit 
very little. Sugar, salt, bacon, ham, onions, parsnips, carrots, pep- 
per, garlic, mustard, her))s, spices, lemons, and many other articles 
are used for flavoring food. 

210. Butter and oleomargarine. — ^The allowance, one-half ounce 
per man per day, is sufficient for hot cakes, rolls, or biscuits. It 
should be served individually. 

211. Lard and lard substitute. — The cash credit of this component 
is sufficient. The suet from beef and all surplus fat received should 
be carefully rendered. This with the grease skimmed from stock, 
soups, and gravies will furnish most of the shortening, drippings, etc., 
required in the kitchen. A pan or kettle in which the suet is ren- 
dered should be kept on the stove and all fat should be placed in it. 
The grease which gathers on the stock or on gravies, etc., ahould be 
skimmed off and placed in this pan. Each evening the grease which 
has accumulated in the suet pan is strained off into a jar or other re- 
ceptacle and placed in a cool place. This accumulation which is 
called drippings can be used for frying, either deep or shallow, and 
can be used in rolls or pastry when carefully strained. Lard, how- 
ever, is better for the latter. 

212. Desserts. — The ration contains all the material necessary for 
supplying a dessert each day. The recipes given herein provide a 
sufficient variety. .The dessert is usually one of the cheapest compo- 
nents of the meal and should be given at dinner and frequently at 
3upper. The men enjoy it, especially on bean day, when a good 
plum duff is much relished by those who do not care' for beans. 

A good sauce should be j)rovided for puddings. It costs little and 
l"? well Uked. One gallon is sufficient for about 25 men. 



Chapter III. 

MEAT. 

213. Meat is the general term applied to the flesh of ammals 
'for food. It includes the muscular flesh, sinews, fat, heart, liver, 
stomach, brains, and tongue. Meat is divided into three classes: 

Meat, including beef, veal, mutton, lamb, and pork 
" Poultry, including chickens, turkeys, geese, ducks, and all other 
domestic fowls. 

Gavfie, including partridges, grouse, pigeons, quail, and other birds; 
venison, and all wild meat that is hunted in forest or field. 

214. Meat consists of several substancea— ^6rin, albumen, gelatine, 
fat, and the juice ofjlesh. 

215. Fibrin exists in the blood and flesh. In the former it is 
soluble, owing to the alkaline nature of the blood. It is deposited 
by the blood made intp flesh, and becomes insoluble flesh fibrin and 
forms a basis of fiber of museular tissue. It is separated into bundles 
by membranes, and into larger or separate masses by cellular tissue, 
in which fat is deposited. Its true color is white; but the blood in 
the veins, which penetrates every part of the fiber, gives it a reddish 
tinge. This may be seen by washing a piece of meat in cold water. 
The red coloring matter is soon drawn out into the water and the 
remainder is a mass of white fiber. Fibrin is hardened and con- 
|,tracted by intense heat, but softened by moderate and long con- 
tinued heat. Meat that has, tough fiber should simmer, not boil. 

216. Albumen exists in the flesh and the blood. It is the soluble 
portion of the flesh. It dissolves in cold water, but hardenw in hot 
water. 

217. Gelatine is a peculiar substance found in the tendons and 
^stly parts of the flesn, in the shin and the sinewy parts about the 
joints, and in the nutritive parts of the bones. It may be dissolved 
by soaking in cold water, and then kept at a simmering tempera- 
ture for several hours. The solution hardens when cold. Gelatine 

53 



64 MANUAL FOB ARMY COOKS. 

hardens in a dry heat, and such parts of meat as contain it in 
abundance should be stewed, rather than roasted or broiled, or used 
in the form of a pot roast, soft roast, or beef k la mode. 

218. The fat of meat is almost exclusively found in the adipose 
tissue of almost all flesh which is used as food. It is liquifiea by 
heat and resolved into various acid and acrid bodies. It is a warmtn 
giver and is therefore most appropriately used in cold seasons and 
climates. 

219. The juice of flesh consists of water, a small portion of albumen 
and a mixture of other compounds. It is not the blood for it still 
exists after the blood has been withdrawn. It may be obtained by 
chopping lean meat into small pieces, putting it in a closely covered 
iar without water and heating it gradually. If heated above 160° 
F., the albuminous matters in it harden, turning brown. The solid 
residue, consisting of fibers, tissue, etc., is white, tasteless and in- 
odorous. This separated juice is stronglv acid, while the blood ie 
always alkaline. It contains many substances which are very 
valuable as food, and the savory principle, which gives flavor to the 
meat and causes it to differ in different animals. Meat should always 
be cooked in such a manner as to retain the largest proportion of this 
juice. The juice is drawn out into the brine in salting, thus render- 
ing salt meat less nutritous. The juice, when the water has been 
separated from it by evaporation, is termed "Extract of beef." 

220. The flesh of all young animals is more tender, but not as 
nutritious as that of maturer animals. Nearly all parts of the animal 
may be used as food. 

Meat is in season all the year, but certain kinds are better during 
certain seasons. Pork is best in autumn and winter; veal in the 
spring and summer; venison in winter; fowls in autunm and winter; i 
lamb in the summer and fall; mutton and beef, at any time. 

221. Preserving fresh meat. — Fresh meat is more nutritious and 
palatable than salted or cured meat. It is, therefore, desirable to 
use as large a proportion of fresh meat as possible. In a company 
refrigerator with a temperature of 55° F. fresh meat can be Kept 
with safety for three or four days. When the temperature is 
reduced to 40° F., or less, with good ventilation and circulation^ 
of air, fresh meat can be kept for a week or 10 days. It is very 
important that the circulation be free and the air dry. Moisture 



MANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 55 

in a refrigerator tends to develop wet mold or slime, and a little 
decay soon contaminates the whole piece. Less diflBculty will be 
experienced in preserving fresh meat if it is kept in a room where 
the temperatiu-e is relatively high and the air dry than where the 
temperature is low and the air damp. 

In the North, meat is kept during the cold season by freezing. 
A carcass is cut up into quarters, or even smaller pieces, and hung 
in an outbuilding where it will remain frozen solid. When a por- 
tion is wanted it may be cut off with a saw. If the meat is tnen 
taken into a cold room and slowly thawed out the flavor is only 
slightly injured. No more should be taken in at one time than is 
wanted fpr immediate use. Repeated freezing and thawing are 
injurious to the flavor and quality of the meat, hence the impor- 
t-ance of keeping it where the temperature will remain sufficiently 
low to prevent thawing. 

Insects should not be allowed to get at the meat. For this reason 
a dark, cool cellar is a good place for keeping it. The cellar should 
be well ventilated, clean, and free fromi odors, or the meat will 
become tainted. 

222. How to preserve fresh meat when refrigerator facilities are 
not at hand. — It should be hung in a cool, dry place and in a draft 
if possible. It should be well protected from mes by having cheese- 
cloth or other gauzy material for a covering, and this should be 
; himg loosely about tne meat so as to permit a free circulation of air,, 
i If care be exercised in the handling of meat it can be kept for sev- 
leral days without the least sign of decay. A test to reveal the 
commencement of decay is the knife-blade test. Insert a clean 
knife blade in the meat to the bone, and if it can be extracted 
without resistance of the tissue it is an indication that the meat 
|has begun to decay. The smell of the blade will indicate whether 
decomposition has commenced. 

The cloth used for the protection of the meat is principally to 
keep •flies from it, and hence it should not at any point come in 
direct contact with the meat. The meat may be himg in the mid- 
dle of a frame made of barrel hoops. The cloth is then placed 
around the hoops, thus preventing flies from reaching the meat 
iind permitting a free circulation of air. It may frequently become 
Qecessary to keep meat for several days in camp. In wooaed coun- 



56 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

try a good place is generally found in the shade of a tree and about 
3 or 4 feet from the ground. However, it is still better to hang 
the meat about 30 feet high in the branches of a tree. In case 
no trees are available it should be hung in a shady spot provided 
by erecting a fly and suspending the meat from the ridgepole, where 
it will have plenty of draft. 

223. Curing meats. — Meat must be properly and thoroughly cooled 
to insure good keeping qualities when cured. If salted before the 
animal heat is out, the shrinkage of the muscles causes the retention 
of injurious gases, giAing an offensive odor to the meat. Neither 
should meat be frozen when salted, as the action of the frost will 
prevent the proper penetration of the salt and an uneven curing 
will result. It is important, also, that meat be cured as soon as cooled 
and while still fresh. Tainted meat may be cured so that it will 
keep, but nothing in the line of preservatives can bring back the 
natural flavor when it is once lost. The safest rule to follow is to 
salt meat as soon as the animal heat is out and before it freezes or 
starts to decay. Ordinarily, 24 to 36 hours after slaughtering will 
allow time for cooling. 

224. Vessel for curing. — A clean hard-wood barrel is a suitable 
vessel in which to cure meat, A barrel made for the purpose is best, 
but where it can not be had a molasses or sirup barrel will answer. 

A kerosene barrel that has been burned out and used as a water 
barrel for some time is often used for a meat barrel. The important 
part is to have it clean, free from odors, and tight enough to prevent 
leakage. A large stone jar is the best vessel that can be used. One 
holding 25 to 30 gallons is expensive however, and must be carefully 
handled to prevent breakage. A jar is more easily cleaned than a 
barrel and is in every way preferable if the first cost can be afforded. 
A barrel or jar that has once held meat may be used again and again 
unless the meat has spoiled in it. If used repeatedly it is necessary 
to scald it out thoroughly each time before packing with fresh meat. 

THE BEEF COMPONENT. 

225. The cash value of the beef component if properly handled 
is sufficient to cover the cost of all meats used in thp company kitchen 
and provide a saving for other articles. By careful selection of such 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 57 

low-priced meats as liver, beef hearts, and sausages together with 
such high-priced meats as pork, fish, chicken, etc., an average price 
will result which will enable one to secure a satisfactory variety, 
while living within the limits of the ration. Such purchases are 
economical when it is considered that these low-priced meats are 
generally without bone which in beef constitutes about 20 or 25 
per cent of the whole weight. 

Remember that in handling meat in the kitchen all bones and 
trimmings must be retained until the juices are extracted for stock 
and all suet and fat are rendered for drippings. 

When meat is received in quarters, it is of the utmost importance 
that the mess sergeant and cooks understand how to cut it up for 
kitchen use and for what purpose each cut is best adapted. The 
instructions given in the following pages should be carefully fol- 
lowed. All tough parts of fresh meat should be put through the 
grinder and used as Hamburg steaks, hash, and meat balls. 

Remember that in cooking tough meats a long period of slow 
cooking is required. 

All meat should be sliced in the kitchen before serving in order 
that fats, gristle, and other portions that will be left, if taken on 
the men's plates, may be saved and either rendered out or used in 
some other form. 

226. Specifications for fresh beef. — To be good in quality and con- 
dition, fit for immediate use, and equal numbers of fore and hind 
quarters to be delivered, including ail the best cuts; no carcass to 
weigh less than 500 pounds when trimmed; necks to be cut off per- 
pendicular to the line of the vertebrae, leaving but three cervical 
vertebrae on the carcass; the shanks of fore quarters to be cut off at 
the knee joint and hind quarters at the hock joint (commercial cut), 
and to compensate for the shank bone thus allowed to remain 2| 
pounds will be deducted from the weight of each fore quarter and 
3^ pounds from each hind quarter; difference between fore and liind 
quarters not to exceed 25 pounds per carcass (one rib to be left on 
each hind quarter). Neds, kidney fat, beef from bulls and stags and 
from females {except from spayed heifers) will be excluded from delivery. 
Such quantities of fresh meat as may be required by the quarter- 
master from time to time shall be delivered to him in bulk at the 
I quartermaster's storehouse or other designated place on such days 



68 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

and at such hours as he may prescribe under the direction of his 
commanding officer. 

227 . Bemarks on specifications. — In order that the difference in 
weight between fore and hind quarters shall not exceed the limit 
(25 pounds per carcass) the cut must he made so as to leave one rib only 
on the hind quarter, and this is the ordinary packing house cut. 

The minimum weight is placed at 500 pounds to insure getting a 
proper proportion of meat to bone. 

The specified neck cutis unusual in commercial transactions, and 
the delivery will generally be made with five or six neck vertebrae 
left on the carcass unless apecial attention is paid to this trimming. 
The neck meat is worth commercially about one-half the contract 
price for the carcass and it should be accepted under no circum- 
stances. 

The deduction of two and one-half pounds for the shank of the fore- 
quarter and three and one-half pounds for the hock (both of which were 
formerly cut out before delivery) is very apt to be overlooked by the 
contractor unless especially cautioned by the responsible person. 
Neglect to make the neck and shank trimmings and deductions net 
the contractor more than $3 a carcass even when the price is as low- 
as 11 cents per pound, 

By ^'kidney'* fat is meant the fat immediately surrounding the 
kidney and does not refer to other suet in the hind quarter. 

The meat from bulls, stags, and cows is excluded for the reason that 
it is inferior to that from the steer of the same age and condition. 

A careful study of the characteristics that definitely determine the 
differences between these classes of carcasses is necessary in order to 
protect the interests of the Government and of the companies, and 
they are clearly shown in the accompanying cuts. 

228. Sex of beef. — By definition, the bull is the uncastrated male, 
and the stag a male castrated late in life. In practice, a bull is cas- 
trated when he has served his purpose, and economy requires that 
he should be placed on the market. Being castrated he takes on 
flesh and being fattened brings a better price at the stock yards. 
As a bull he will rarely fatten under any circumstances, but in either 
case, the flesh is very dark — conspicuously so — and the muscles 
*'8tand out," hard and compact, especially on the shanks. In the 
cod there is almost an entire absence of scrotal fat. The carcass of 



ilANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 59 

the bull or stag shows massive shoulders, a thick, bulging neck, 
broad chest, a very round rump, and coarse-grained flesh. His fore- 
quarters are relatively larger than his hind quarters. His general 
make-up is so different from that of the steer that if after careful 
-examination of the carcass a doubt exists as to whether it is a steer 
or a stag (or bull) the chances are that it is a steer. 

Thenesh of bulls and stags is drier than that of steers and cows, and 
is used to aa vantage in bologna and sausages, for when cured it will 
have taken up and retained more moisture than other classes of beef. 
As a rule contractors will not now attempt to run in such meat in 
quantity, but if it is delivered it should be promptly rejected. It is 
generally tough and unsuited to company use. 

A steer is a male not full grown, castrated when yoimg, and an ox 
the corresponding full grown animal. Generally spealSiig, we call 
the meat from the carcass of either "steer meat, " and for Army use 
the only beef delivered should be from animals from 2 to 6 years of 
age, excepting only the meat from the "spayed heifers, " which ia 
occasionally supplied. 

A s'payea'heifer is a female from which the ovaries were removed early 
An life. Cows are somtetimes spayed after having had one or more 
calves, if it is necessary to let them run at large with a herd while 
preparing them for the market, but if the operation has been per- 
formed at all the scar should generally be plainly visible in the left 
flank (though the ovaries are some times otherwise removed). 

A cow is a female that has had a calf. A maiden heifer la an adult 
female that has not been allowed to breed. 

Cows are frequently not placed on the market imtil much benefit 
has been derived from them either for dairy or breeding purposes, 
and conseouently, they are generally older than steers when slaugh- 
tered. If killed within a certain period before or after calving- they 
are considered unfit for food . 

Generally speaking, a steer produces considerably more flesh to bone 
than the cow, and the carcass of a steer at the present time brings 
from 2 to 2^ cents per pound more than that of a cow in the same 
condition. This explains the tendency of contractors to run in cow 
meat whenever it will be accepted. 

The accompanying photographs with explanations will render the 
determination of sex in dressed beef a simple matter. 



60 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

229. Age and quality. — The age of dressed beef can be estimated 
by the character of the cartilage tipping the spines of the dorsal 
vertebrae; by that between the vertebrae throughout the spinal 
column, and by that in the brisket, sufficiently well to indicate the 
toughness or tenderness of the beef so as to regulate its acceptance or 
rejection. Wlien the layers of cartilage between the vertebrae 
become so tough and hard as to resist the penetration of the point of 
a skewer of soft pine wood, the quarter should generally be rejected 
because the steer was too old. The eye will note as accompanying 
this condition, a very limited amount of cartilage in the brisket 
(practically none in the cow); the bones of the sacrum will have 
generally grown into a solid mass, with few or no lines of demarca- 
tion between the several vertebrae; the cartilaginous extensions of 
the spines of the dorsal vertebrae will be more bone than cartilage 
(in the cow they -will be solid bone) ; the diaphragm will be exceed- 
ingly tough ; the bones will present a bleached out appearance instead 
of being ruddy or full of blood as in youth; and the marrow will be 
hard and light yellow or almost white instead of soft and red. Gen- 
erally the fat will be hard and yellow instead of soft and white as in 
youth, although in some breeds of cattle the fat is naturally yellow 
at all ages. The cartilage of the joints will be pale white instead of 
\ having a bluish tinge as in youth, and more or less ''water'* may be 
present. 

The flesh, of veal is of a j>ale red color. That of a steer should be a 
bright re(i ; a deeper red indicates greater age and toughness. The 
flesh of a cow is generally darker than that of a steer in the same 
condition. The flesh of bulls and stags is very dark, so dark that it 
should at once be detected. Color in meat should be judged from 
portions that have been cut a few minutes previously. Fi'eshly cut 
portions and those that have been exposed to the air for a consider- 
able period present an unnaturally dark appearance. (For method 
of telling age of cattle on the hoof see par. 2305, Manual for the 
Quartermaster Corps, 1916.) 

In passing upon meat it should be remembered that the contract 
specifications are so definitely stringent, so far as the contractor is 
concerned, and so liberal with respect to the troops, that almost any 
quality of beef can be procured that is insisted upon by the quarter- 
master and post commander. It is contemplated by the Quarter- 



MANUAL FOE ARMY COOKS. 



61 



master Corps that the beef shall b9 "good in quality and condition," 
etc., and contractors regulate their bids by the interpretation they 
have noted has been made as to the same by the post authorities. 
A strict interpretation of the requirements results in high bids and 
increased cost of the ration. 

It is considered, however, that regardless of what may have been 
the contractor's estimate of the situation at any particular post, he 
should be required to comply strictly with specifications as to sex, 
weight of carcass, trimming of necks and allowance of weights for shanks, 
etc.,^ but that a reasonable interpretation should be put upon the 
clause referring to "quality and condition." Beef for Army use 
should be only moderately fat, though the fat should be well distrib- 
uted and the cuts of lean meat present a marbled appearance. Beef 
in good condition and Otherwise complying with the contract should 
be accepted if between 2 and 6 years of age. It is perfectly evident 
that we can not expect to be supplied with corn-fed beef from native 
stock, 2 years of age and younger, as part of the regular ration. 

230. Selection of parts for different uses in the kitchen. — The parts 
of the carcass should be selected in the following order, when quality 
alone is considered :

1 While the higher grades of meat may be boiled or corned, if desired or if necessary 
to save them from spoiling, the parts above mentioned are those selected during the 
regular routine of kitchen work as being the most economical. 



For Hamburg steak and potpies, meat from all parts of the carcass 
may be used, though the quality will, of course, depend much upon 
the tenderness or toughness of the parts used. 



«2 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 



For stews, any part of the carcass may be used ; but for reasons of 
economy it is best to use the parts noted for boiled beef. 

For soups, all bones broken or sawed, and the particles of meat 
clinging tnereto, may be used. Left-over meats may be worked in 
as noted in the recipes.

MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 65 

Cow and steer carcasses of about the same age, condition, and 
general appearance are represented. 

The cow carcass. — Note, in comparison with the steer, the slender 
hock and the dished-in appearance between the hock and rump; 
that the exterior fat of the carcass meets the end of the aitch bone 
at a'; that the inner end of the aitch bone is slightly refused, pro- 
viding a broader passage for gii-ing birth to a calf. 

The rump bones at y are separated in youth, but become solid at 
about 3 years of age, leaving no lines of demarcation. 

The forniation of a^ can not be greatly altered for the purpose of 
deception' and this »vith the udder, if not cut away, are the positive 
proofs of sex. 

The backbone at c' seems to be relatively weak and is generally 
broken during cleavage while dressing the carcass. The loin at this 
point generally presents a dished-in appearance. 

The steer carcass. — Xete, in comparison with the cow, the large 
hock, the plump appearance between the hock and rump; that the 
exterior fat of the carcass is separated from the aitch bone at a by 
about 2 inches of lean meat, to which a portion of the penis is gen- 
erally still attached, as shown in the photograph; that the inner 
end of the aitch bone juts into the passaije, narrowing it. 

The rump bones at h do not grow together as early as in the cow, 
and show distinct lines of demarcation up to about 6 years. 

The backbone at c is firm and the loin near this point straight or 
plump. 

The formation at a and the presence of the cod (scrotal fat) are 
positive proofs of sex. If the cod has been cut away, it is sufficient 
cause for rejection, as this is generally done only for Jhe purpose of 
making the cow and steer carcasses appear so much, alike that the 
cow carcasses can be run in on the contract.

Sieer carcass. — Note that the spines of the dorsal vertebrae are 
tipped at a \vith wliite cartilage called "buttons." In very young 
animals this cartilage is perfectly white. In the 2-year old animal 
little red spots appear. At 3 they are more numerous. At 4 bony 
islands form. At 5 there is more bone than cartilage. At 6 there is 
but a narrow strip of white cartilage left surrounding the bone that 
has formed, but the line of demarcation between "spine" and "but- 
tons " is distinct. By 9 years of age the button is solid bone and at 
12 is of the same color as the bone of the spine. If 6 or older the beef 
should be rejected. 

Note that at the forward end of the breast bone at b solid wliite 
•cartilage is found. It disappears with age, as do the "buttons." 



MANUAL FOE ABMY COOKS. 69 

There is also a relatively large amount of cartilage between first and 
second bones of the breast. 

The ribs are distinctly curved lengthwise and also in cross section. 
They extend perpendicularly outward from the back bone and ^t 
about the fifth vertebra from the rear. The knee is coarse. 

Cow carcass. — Note the absence of the buttons at a^ referred to 
above. They appear in the heifer as in the steer, but generally dis- 
appear entirely between 2 and 3 years of age leaving no lines of 
demarcation. If none are present the quarter should be rejected. 

In comparison with the steer there is very little cartilage at 6^. 

The ribs are straighter than in the steer and quite fiat. They 
begin to bend backward at about the fifth vertebra from the rear. 

The knee is slender.

12. Pork. — Fresh pork is not supplied by the Quartermaster 
58 and, when desired, must generally be purchased from sav- 
i on the ration, unless hogs are raised by the company. The 
ing up of pork is very simple, as the meat is tender and the 
es are relatively soft. Unlike beef and mutton, it should be 
as soon as cooled throughout. If the carcass is thoroughly 
led, it is well to have two knives and one cleaver, the utensils 
in use being kept submerged in a bucket of hot water. If the 
ass is still warm, an extra knife is not necessary. Trim off most 
le fat and use the loin for chops and the shoulder and ham for 
ts. All left-over parts — head, skin, and shanks — may be used, 
ther with an equal portion of beef, in the preparation of head- 
jse or sausage. (See recipe.)

244. Matton. — Mutton is occasionally supplied to companies in 
accordance with the following specifications: 

To be of a good, fat, marketable quality, from wethers over 1 and 
under 3 years old; the carcasses to be tnnwned with the heads cut 
; off at the first vertebral joint, the shanks of fore quarters at the knee 
' joint, and of hind at the hock joint; the average weight of the dressed 
carcass of mutton to be about 50 pounds. 

The leg may be cut into steaks, but is generally roasted or boiled. 
The loin may be cut into chops, using one rib to a chop, or may be 
roasted. The shoulder may be used as a roast when from a youcg 
animal, or as a boil when from an old one. The brisket and flanks 
may be used for stews and the neck and shank for soup stock. The 
meat remaining in the stock boiler may be used up in fritters, meat 
balls, croquettes, etc., though the juices having been extracted, the 
meat will be hard and dry. 

245. Fish, on account of its abundance, cheapness, and whole- 
Bomeness, is invaluable as an article of food . It is less nutritious and 
less stimulating than me.at, as it contains less solid matter and more 
water. As it contains little fat, the white varieties particularly, it 
ie easily digested and, as it has a large proportion of nitrogenous 
matter, it is an especially good food for those upon whom there is a 
great demand for nervous energy. Salmon heads the list of fish in 
nutritive qualities and it is richer than meat. Next in value are fat 
halibut, shad, whitefish, mackerel, bluefish, lean halibut, bass, 
flounder, trout, haddock, cusk. 

Red-blooded fish, like salmon, mackerel, and bluefish, have the oil 
distributed throughout the body. They are nutritious for those who 
can digest them, but are too rich and oily for invalids. WTiite fish, 
like flounder, halibut, cod, and haddock, have the oil in the liver 
and are more easily digested. Fish should be perfectly fresh and 
thoroughly cooked, or it is very indigetHible and sometimes poison- 
ous. Boiling and baking are the best methods of cooking them, 
Small pan fish and fillets of large white dry fish are good if fried, 
but oily fish should never be fried. Salting draws out the nutritive 
part of the fish the same as it does in meat, and either fish or meat, 
thus prepared, should be used as a relish and not depended upon for 
Qourishment. Fat fish are injured less than white fi^, as the fat is 
Qot removed by salting. 



78 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

All varieties of fish need an accompaniment of starchy foods, like 
bread or potatoes; and white fish need, in addition, to be cooked with 
butter or fat to make them desirable as food. The juices of fish, 
shellfish particularly, are of an alkaline nature and this renders 
lemon jiuce or \dnegar a desirable condiment as a neutralizing^ 
agency. 

The flesh of good fish is firm and hard and will rise at once when 
pressed with the finger. If the eyes be dull and sunken, the gills 
pale, and the flesh flabby or soft, the fish is not fresh. 

Fish should be cleaned as soon as possible in strongly salted water. 
They should be wiped with a cloth wet in salt water, then wrapped 
in a cloth which is sprinkled with salt, and put in a cool place. 
Put ice around if necessary, but do not allow them to remain in 
ice water, which will soften them. \Mien once they lose their hard, 
firm consistency they are considered unfit for food. 

Frozen fish should be thawed in cold water. Fresh fish having; 
a muddy taste or smell are improved by soaking in salt water.i 
Salted fish should be soaked in fresh water, with the skin side up: 
to draw out the salt. 

246. To dean a fish. — If the fish have scales, remove them before 
opening. To do this, scrape with a small, sharp knife from the tail 
to the head; hold the knife at an angle, resting it on the fish, that the 
scales maybe taken upon the knife; scrape slowly, that thescalef 
may not fly over everything near, and rinse the knife often in cold 
water. 

When the fish is to be served whole do not remove the head and 
tall. Smelts and small fish served whole are opened under the gillt 
and the contents sqeezed out by pressing from the middle with the 
thumb and finger. Large fish are split open from the gills halfwaj 
down the lower part of the body, the entrails removed, and th< 
inside scraped and cleaned. Open far enough to remove all the 
blood on the backbone. It is better to remove the sound, which i| 
the white part adhering to the bone, though it is often left in the fish, 

247. To skin a fish. — Cut a thin narrow strip down the backbone, 
taking off the dorsal fin, then open the lower part halfway down! 
Slip the knife under and up through the bony part of the gills, hoU 
this bony part between the thumb and finger, and strip the skirl 
off toward the tail. Next do the same on the other side. Smal; 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 79 

ash, like mackerel and whitefish, when dressed for broiling should 
\>e split through the back. 

248. To bone a fish. — Clean and strip off the skin; lay the fish 
flat on a board; begin at the tail and run the knife under the flesh 
;lo8e to the bone, holding the flesh carefully so as not to break the 
lakes. When the fish on one side is removed slip the knife under 
ihe bone on the other side and raise the bone, leaving the flesh on 
ihe board; then pull out all the small bones left in the flesh, which 
;an be easily felt with the fingers. Fish with many bones, like 
jhad and herring, are not boned; but from cod, husk, mackerel, 
jrhitefish, and haddock they may be easily removed. 

Fillets of fish. — Fillets of fish are the flesh separated from the 
jone and served whole or divided, as the case may require. Floun- 
ler, sole, halibut, and bass should have the fillets on each side di- 
idded lengthwise, making four long thin pieces or fillets. Other 
lish are cut into thin slices or squares. Very small fish may be 
.?plit, the bones removed, and the whole fish rolled up from the 
:ail to the head and fastened with a skewer 



Chapter IV. 

THE ELEMENTARY PRINCIPLES OF COOKING AND THE 
ELEMENTS OF NUTRITION. 

249. Preparation of food, or proper cooking, has much to do with 
the nutritive value. Cooking changes food into more soluble forms 
and renders it more nutritious and appetizing. The application of 
the heat necessary for cooking destroys any disease germs, parasites, 
and dangerous organisms that the food may contain. This applies 
to both animal and vegetaljle food. The cooking of meat brings 
out the flavor and odor of the extractives and softens the gelatin- 
oids of the connective tissues, making the meat more tender. Ex- 
treme heat, however, has a tendency to harden the lean portions 
(albuminoids) and decrease the flavor. 

Meats lose weight in cooking, mainly through the loss of water. 
The nutritive value of beef soup depends upon the substances dis 
solved by the water out of the meat, bones, and gristle. 

In many vegetables the valuable portions (carbohydrates) are 
contained in tiny cells with thick walls on which the digestive 
juices have little effect. The heat of cooking ruptures these walls 
and makes the starch more soluble. The heat tends also to produce 
agreeable flavors by changing the starch into sugar. 

Flour is made more palatable in the form of bread, cake, and 
pastry through the use of compressed air, yeast, or baking powder. 

Scrupulous cleanliness should always be obser\'ed in handling, 
keeping, and serving the food. This is most important for the sake 
of health. Cleanliness in handling food not onl^'^ consists in personal 
cleanliness, the cleanliness of utensils, kitchen equipment, etc., 
but also freedom from undesirable bacteria, other minute organisms, 
worms, and parasites. ^ Food, raw or cooked, should be kept scrupu- 
lously clean, whether in the market, the cart, or the storeroom; 
otherwise it is likely to be contaminated. Infected water, milk, 



MANUAL FOE ABMY COOKS. 81 

oysters, and certain vegetables have been known to spread typhoid, 
cholera, scarlet fever, and diphtheria, thus bringing sickness and 
death to large numbers of people. 

Meats may also contain parasites such as tapeworms in beef, pork, 
and mutton, also trichinae in pork, which are always injurious to 
the health. 

Vegetables, too, have been known to become contaminated with 
the eggs of parasites, due to certain garden fertilizers. 

Raw fruits and vegetables should always be thoroughly cleaned 
before eating. The heat of cooking is usually sufficient to destroy 
all dangerous organisms. 

250. Methods of cooking. — The object to be attained will often 
decide the manner of cooking. For example, in roasting meat we 
desire to retain the juices within. Hence the meat is placed in a 
very hot oven to seal the pores and prevent the escape of the juices, 
the oven being reduced to a lower temperature when the meat has 
been thoroughly browned. 

To make beef stock, first place the bones and fresh meat in cold 
water for some time, as the juices of the bones and meat are readily- 
extracted in this manner. The process is hastened by the addi- 
tion of a little salt. 

To make a stew or potpie, a part of the meat juices should be 
retained in the meat and a part in the surrounding liquid; hence 
we place the meat in cold water and bring it to a boil as soon as 
possible in order to seal the pores after a certain amount of the juice 
has been extracted. 

To get the best results in boiling beef, it is necessary to retain the 

juices within the meat. For this reason the water is made to boil 

briskly before the meat is introduced. Upon contact with the hot 

water the pores are sealed. The temperature is then lowered and 

) the cooking continued at a simmering point. 

Size^ of articles. — The time required for cooking any article depends 
upon its size; consequently, when several pieces of meat are roasted 
in the same pan, or when potatoes are baked together in the same 
oven, an effort should be made to have them abotit the same size. 



82 MANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 

Beason for uniform texture. — It is owing to the maintenance of an 
even temperature in the presence of moisture that it is possible to 
make bread, cakes, meat balls, fritters, etc., of the same texture 
throughout, while a thin brown crust is formed on the surface. It 
has been shown by the use of a maximum thermometer that while 
the temperature of a baking oven is about 450° F., the temperature 
within a loaf of bread while baking never rises appreciably above 
212° F., the highest temperature of free steam. 

251. Temperature of baking, etc. — Frequently too little attention 
is paid to the proper temperature of the oven and to the general 
character of the meat or other articles to be cooked. For example, 
a temperature that is exactly right for browning a roast will ruin a 
fruit cake in a few minutes. To roast properly a tough piece of meat 
requires a "slow" oven and much time in order .to permit the heat 
to penetrate to the center, thoroughly dissolving and breaking down 
the tissues, thus making it tender, while a small piece of meat can 
be roasted in a "quick oven." It is this principle of slow cooking 
in a moderately low temperature for a long period that renders the 
fireless cooker so much superior to anything else for certain kinds of 
work, especially that of cooking tough meat until it is tender. 

To determine the temperature of an oven. — A good practical method 
of determining the temperature of an oven is to insert the hand well 
into it and count the number of seconds that you are able to keep it 
there. In counting, repeat moderately slowly 0-1000, 1-1000, 
2-1000, and the small numbers indicated will correspond very closely 
to the number of seconds. The burning sensation experienced about 
the roots of the nails is sufficiently uniform to the experienced cook 
to render this a reliable method. It is followed by the experienced 
chef and should be by the student cook. If the temperature of the 
oven is somewhat greater than anticipated, food will often have the 
appearance of being well done, when, as a matter of fact, the cooking 
has barely b^:un. For this reason a cook should have some idea ms 
to the "times" of cooking, as well as to oven temperatures. Con- 
sult the following t*ble.

253. Cold is used in preventing fermentation, hence is a preserva- 
tive of food. We constantly make use of this fact by placing butter, 
milk, meats, etc., in the ice box; by storing certain vegetables and 
fruits in root cellars and pita in the ground ; by preserving yeast in 
a cool place; and by stopping the further proving (rising) of dough, 
so that it shall not be ready to bake before the oven is ready to receive 
it. Fresh meat will keep better in a moderately cool, dry place than 
in a damp ice box at a much lower temperature. Should hot weather 
require the use of the ice box, the meat should not come in contact 
with the walls or with the ice. 

Cold water keeps fresh vegetables from wilting. It quickly 
restores such garden truck as radishes, lettuce, onions, etc., that 
have been exposed to the sun after gathering or have been left in a 
warm temperature for a time, rendering them fresh, crisp, and 
wholesome. Potatoes and turnips that have been peeled must be 
placed in cold water to keep them crisp and to prevent them from 
becoming discolored and tough. If cooked while wilted and dis- 
colored they retain their discoloration and toughness to a con- 
siderable extent. 

Cold water draws out certain unde^rable flavors when vegetables 
and certain canned, barreled, or dried fish and meats are submerged 
in it. It also extracts the juices from meats and bones. This process 
is hastened by the addition of a small Quantity of salt. 

254. Flavors. — Food should possess decided flavors without being 
too highly seasoned. It should be served hot or cold as intended. 
Generally we like our tea, coffee, cooked vegetables, and meats 
served hot, while we prefer our drinking water, butter, salads, fresh 
fruits, such garden truck as lettuce, radishes, and onions, and many 
of our desserts served cold. Many components of a meal that are 
lukewarm instead of decidedly hot or cold are most unappetizing. 

255. Seasoning. — Cooks must not be satisfied with learning the 
proper proportions of ingredients and think that the work is done 
when the cooking begins. Food must be properly prepared, deli- 
cately seasoned, and served hot or cold as desired. Lukewarm, ill- 
seasoned food is unpalatable, and if served in a slovenly manner 
is most unappetizing. Any amount of seasoning at the table can 
not make up for poor seasoning in cooking. The same flavors can 
not be obtained. The only cook that should be styled a chef is one 



MANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 85 

who uses the proper proportions in cooking, who delicately seasons 
his food and serves it in an appetizing manner. 

The heat of cooking seems to create new flavors and to change the 
odor, taste, and digestibility of nearly all food. It swells and bursts 
the starch cells in flour, rice, and potatoes. It hardens the albumen 
of eggs, fish, and meat and softens the fibrous substances in tough 
meats, vegetables, and fruits. It develops new flavors in tea, coffee, 
roast meate, vegetables, crusts of bread, baked beans, etc. 

Air (or the oxygen which it contains) plavs an important part in 
the development of certain flavors. Steak broiled in the open air, 
bread toasted in the same manner, and roasted ears of corn possess 
certain flavors that can not be obtained in any other way. 

It is also noticeable that articles of food cooked in a closed oven 
possess certain flavors that are lost if the cooking is done in the open 
air on the top of the range. 

Baked apples have a particularly fine flavor, largely due to trans- 
formation of starch into sugar and to the caramelization of the sugar 
used in baking. 

It is generally believed that certain vegetables, such as tumipa 
and cabbages, should be well ventilated while boiling, in order that 
the obnoxious sulphurous and other gases may escape from the food 
and that, if this is not done, the vegetables will possess an inferior 
flavor, become discolored, and contain certain elements that are 
injurious. Nevertheless, cabbages and turnips can be boiled per- 
fectly and will retain their fresh color and desirable flavor by sub- 
merging them in boiling water for a half hour or so, according to the 
size. In this way obnoxious fumes do not escape, but such sulphur 
as is extracted from the vegetables remains in the water. 

Water is a necessity in certain forms of cooking. For example, 
beans and peas have to absorb a great deal of water to replace that 
lost in the process of ripening before they can be made into palatable 
food. The same may be said of desiccated (dried) fruits. 

256. Deep lard. — The advantage of choking in deep lard lies in the 
fact that lard or drippings can be heated to such an extremely high 
temperature that certain articles can be thoroughly cooked without 
giving time for the grease to soak into them. Grease boils at about 
665 to 600° F., but this temperature is too high for cooking; the ex- 
terior of the food would be burned before it is cooked throughout. 



86 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

The grease begins to smoke between 385 and 450° F., and this is 
the best temperature at which to use it. A common error is to 
introduce too much food at one time, cooling the fat and allowing it 
to soak into the food before it is thoroughly cooked. If this fact is 
borne in mind, almost anything that can be fried at all can be fried 
in "deep lard." Meat balls, potato balls, and croquettes are rolled 
in egg and cracker or bread crumbs before frying; the egg coagulates, 
and the crumbs, which are held in place by it, form a brown crust 
surrounding the ball, and the grease is prevented from penetrating 
further. Corn fritters contain eggs, and a good crust is quickly 
formed, preventing the penetration of the grease. 

It is noticed that as soon as the articles mentioned have been 
dropped into the grease which is far below its boiling point a violent 
ebullition is observed. This is due to the escape of steam formed 
by contact of the moisture in the article introduced with the hot 
grease. All articles fried in deep lard should have as dry a surface 
as possible. If food with a damp siu-face is introduced, grease is 
apt to be thrown out upon the range, take fire, and cause trouble. 

ELEMENTS OF NUTRITION'. 

257. The problem of proper nutrition has always been of great 
importance, yet scientilic study of this subject is comparatively 
recent. Food investigation has been carried on in Europe for 
almost three-quarters of a century. It is more recent in the United 
States. 

Constant use has made us familiar with oiu: ordinary foods, but 
we seldom realize how complicated they are. To understand them 
requires much study of chemistry, physics, and physiology — more, 
indeed, than the average man desires to trouble with. However, 
we can better understand dieting and feeding of men by being 
famihar with a few of the elementary principles of nutrition. 

258. The chemical composition of the body and of food are very 
similar. They are made up of the same chemical elements and 
should be discussed together. From 15 to 20 of these elements are 
found in both the body and food. The most abundant of these are 
oxygen, hydrogen, carbon, nitrogen, calcium, phosphorus, and 
sulphur. These elements are so combined as to fonn a great variety 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 87 

of compounds, of which the most important are protein, fats, carbo- 
hydrates, mineral matter, and water. 

The functions of these compounds in the food are to build and 
repair the tissues, to furnish muscular and other power for the work 
the body has to do, and to furnish heat to keep the body warm. 

259. Water is the most abundant of these compounds. It forms 
over 60 per cent of the weight of the body of the average man and is 
a component part of all the tissues. It is an important part of food, 
although it cannot be burned and yields no energy to the body. 

200. Mineral matter yields little or no energy, yet is indispensable 
to the body. It forms only 5 or 6 per cent of the body by weight 
and is found chiefly in the bones and teeth, but is alsopresent in 
the other tissues and in solution in the various fluids. When food, 
or body material, is burned, the mineral constituents remain as ash. 

261. Protein. — The term includes the principal nitrogenous com- 
pounds in foods which are the tissue formers and make the frame- 
work of the body, build up and repair the nitrogenous materials such 
as the muscles and tendons, and supply the albuminoids of the blood, 
milk, and other fluids. 

These compounds form about 18 per cent of the weight of the body 
and are subdivided into: 

Albuminoids, which include substances similar to the white of an 
egg, the lean of meat, curd of milk, and gluten of wheat. 

Gelatinoids, which occur principally in the connective tissues, such 
as the collagen of the skin and tendons, and the ossein of the bones. 

Extractives are the principal ingredients of meat extracts, beef tea^ 
and beef stock. They are believed neither to build tissue nor to- 
fumish energy, but to act as stimulants and appetizers. The craving, 
which some persons have for meats is believea to be due, in part, tO' 
a desire for these extractives. The same compounds are found in. 
potatoes and other vegetable foods. 

The albuminoids and gelatinoids are the most important elements 
of our food. They are essential, as they make the basis of bone, mus- 
cle, and other tissues. They are most abundant in animal food such 
as lean meat, though the cereals contain them to a considerable ex- 
tent, and peas and beans in large proportion. 

262. Fats, which form about 15 per cent of the weight of the ordi- 
nary man, occur chiefly in animal foods such aa meat, fish, butter, 



88 MANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 

etc. They are also abundant in some vegetable products such as 
olives and cotton seed, from which the oils are derivafd. They also 
are found in some cereals, notably oatmeal and maize and in various 
nuts. In our bodies, and those of other animals, fats occur in masses 
under the skin and in other locations and in minute particles throu^- 
out the tissues. The amount of fat in the body varies with condi- 
tions. "WTien more food is taken than is necessary for intmediate 
use part of it is stored as a reserve chiefly in the form of fat, \V^en 
the rood supply is short this reserve material is drawn upon for" sup- 
plementary fuel. 

^ 263. Carbohydrates, which form only about 1 per cent of the lj)Gd-y 
tissues, include such compounds aa starches, migars, and fibeis at 
plants (cellulose). They are found chiefly in vegetable food — cenft- 
als, potatoes, and fruits — forming an abundant source of energy-, aad 
are imjjortant food ingredients,, easily digested. They are trans- 
iormed into fat in the body and remaik stored in concentrated form^ 
for future use. 

264. Befuse is that part of our food ,. such as bones of jSsh and meat , 
shells of eggs, skins and seeds of fruit and vegetables, etc., which 
ha^•e little or no nutritive value and which are either unpalatable 
or can not be easily digested . These materialah contain the same in- 
gredients as the edible portions,, though ueually in smaller pro- 
portion. 

265. Use of expensive food. — ^The mistake is often made of pur- 
chasing expensive varieties of food when chescper ones will answer 
the purpose just as well. The cause of this error is ignorance of the 
simple principles of nutrition and the result is a waste of monev. 
The maxim "the best is the cheapest" does not apply to the high- 

Ericed foods. The plain substantial standard food materials, like 
sb, milk, flour, com meal, oatmeal, beans, potatoes,, and the cheaper 
cuts of meat are as digestible and as nourishing to people in good 
health as the more expensive articles. 

An understanding of the elements of nutrition,, skillful cooking, 
and tairt-eful servdng will effect a sa\ing that will be surprising. 

266. A balanced diet is one that supplies the proper amount of 
nourishment to the body without ha\Tng any component greatly in 
excess of the requirements. Unless great care is exercised a diet will 
result which is one-sided or badly bal^uiced; that ia,. one wrhich gives 



MANUAL FOB A*MY COOKS, 89 

an excess of either protein or carbohydrates. If a pereon eats lar^ 
quantities of meat and few vegetables, the food is too rich in protein 
and probably harmful. On the other hand, if he eats vegetable food 
to the exclusion of meat he may overload his digestive organs with 
surplus food of that kind, which produces an excess of carbohydrates. 

The Army ration, however, is well balanced and supplies the 
various ingredients in the proper proportions. The mess sergeant 
should study the following table of food values as a guide in purchas- 
ing the varieties of food required to make the mess attractive. He 
should endeavor to select the cheaper articles which assure the 
greatest fuel value, other things being equal, 

267. The table is of special interest when eomparing- the useful- 
ness to the system of different classes of foods or when determining' 
the relative value of substitutive articles. For example, m 
order to keep down the expenses of a mess and to add variety it may- 
be desirable to substitute beans for meat on certain days, Witn 
either beans or meat, potatoes would probably be served, but when 
beans are placed on the bill of fare, they may take the place not only 
of meat, but also of a "second vegetable, " as onions, tomatoes, cab- 
bage, turnips, etc. 

Assume that a mess of 100 men consumes at the noon meal 45 
pounds of solid beef, and as a second vegetable, 25 pounds erf onions. 

From the tables of food values we note: 

Calories, 

45 (pounds roand) X 890 calories 40,050 

25 (povinds onions) X 190 calories : 4,750 

Total „, 44,800 

Now substitute a mess of beans for the above. Twenty-five jwunds 
of beans and five pounds of bacon (for fat and flavor) are considered 
sufficient. 

From the tables of food values we note: 

Calories. 

25 (pounds beans) X 1,520 calories ^^ 38,000' 

5 (pounds bacon) X 2,715 calories 13,575 

Total 51,575 

Assumiitg that the latter are as fully digested as the meat and 
Dnions, it would seem that the ordinary addition of from 20 to 25 
poimds of bacon is an onneceasary expense.

In the same way it may be shown that macaroni and cheese may 
be used as a satisfactory substitute for meat, and practical results bear 
out bur theoretical deduction. In either case, the amount of pro- 
tein (muscle-building material) and of fat and carbohydrates (energy 
producers) compare favorably with that found in the meat. In the 
same way it may be showTi that fresh garden truck should not con- 
stitute the bulk of any meal. Compare the fuel value of coffee, 
cocoa, chocolate, etc.

Chapter V. 

MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY MESS. 

269. Kitchen economy. — In organizations of from 40 to 75 men the 
following enlisted men are required for duty in the company mess: 

1 mess sergeant. 
1 first cook. 
1 second cook. 

1 dining-room orderly. 

2 cook's police. 

For a larger organization, up to 115 men, there should be one addi- 
tional cook's police. In organizations of from 115 to 150 men an 
additional cook should be provided. 

270. Duties of the mess sergeant. — The mess sergeant is in imme- 
diate charge of the mess and directly responsible for its management. 
He should be a well-instructed cook, if possible a graduate of one 
of the training schools, and especially selected on account of his 
fitness for the position. 

Under the direction of the company commander, he draws or 
purchases all rations and other supplies required for the company 
mess. 

He prepares all bills of fare and submits them to the company 
commander for approval. 

He submits to the company commander a daily statement show- 
ing the exact financial condition of the mess. This statement 
includes receipts from all sources from the first of the month, the 
cash credit with the quartermaster, value of stock on hand, the 
allowance from the company fund, if any, and a detailed report of 
the expenditures. A balance is struck, and clearly shows wnether 
the stock on hand, the credit with the quartermaster, and the unex- 
pended cash are sufficient for running the mess for the number of 
days remaining in the ration period. 

He is responsible for the care and preservation of the rations and 
sees that fresh vegetables are picked over when first received. 



94 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

Those decayed should be returned to the quartermaster; otherti 
not in first-class condition should be washed and dried before storing 

He has the cooks' wliite clothing laundered, mended, and re- 
placed when worn out. 

He frequently checks the dishes and utensils for which he is 
responsible, and submits at the end of the month a list of all broken 
or missing articles, with the names of the soldiers against whom 
charges for the same should be entered. 

He has the ice box scrubbed with soap and hot water every day 
just before the ice is delivered. He requires that all utensils, 
including those of the field equipment, are kept clean and in their 
proper places when not in use. 

He requires that the m3n detailed as kitchen police report not 
later than 10 minutes before mess call for breakfast and that they 
absent themselves only by authority or in case of actual necessity. 

He is present in a clean white coat and trousers 30 minutes before 
mess call and personally supervises the final preparation of the food 
and the service of the meals. 

He is responsible for the orderly conduct of those present at meals 
and that all enter the dining room in proper uniform in a quiet and 
orderly manner and with hands and faces washed and hair combed. 

He has the kitchen and dining room prepared for inspection at the 
time appointed b> the company commander. 

He sees that all the seats at the tables are occupied in succsssion, 
beginning with the table farthest away from the entrance. He pre- 
vents loud talking and other unnecessary noises and requires that 
the men wait quietly at their places until the food is passed to them. 
He prevents them from wasting food by taking more on their plates 
than they will eat. Food left on the plates is not used again; that 
which remains on the platters, serving dishes, etc., is returned to the 
kitchen, to be served in some other palatable form at a subsequent 
meal. 

He has the garbage and slop cans frequently emptied, and does 
not allow them to stand in the kitchen or near the outside doors. 
Tin cans and other noncombustible materials must not be mixed 
with slops in garbage cans. The garbage is frequently burned and 
the crematory and cans clog up the grates. If the slops are carried 
away for hogs, cans and glass are a great nuisance. 



MANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 95 

271. Suggestions to mess sergeants. — The bills of fare should vary 
constantly. For each meal there should be at least one dish that has 
not been served for some time. 

Seasonings penetrate foods best in the liquid or semiliquid state 
and much more quickly when hot than when cold, and consequently 
any amount of seasoning after the food is placed on the table can not 
compensate for insufficient or careless seasoning while in the course 
of preparation . 

The prevention of waste and the proper use of left-over food is the 
secret of success in company kitchens. 

The kitchen and storeroom flhould be kept scrupulously neat and 
the men required to clean up immediately after finishing each piece 
of work. Floors and tables should not be allowed to remain littered 
up after the necessity therefor has ceased. A piece of food left on 
the floor is sure to be stepped on, and will make dozens of spots instead 
of o:ie. Cleanliness should be the first lesson taught. 

The kitchen force should at all times present a neat, clean appear- 
ance. Especially should the cooks be clean as regards their toilet, 
as they are continually called upon to mix with their hands such 
articles as cakes, hashes, etc., and to handle nearly all food products 
in preparation for coolang. Men with dirty hands or untrimmed 
dirty fingernails communicate filth and disease germs to foodstuffs 
which they handle. 

Each man should have definite duties assigned to him, for which he 
should be held solely responsible. Work must not be assigned in a 
general way to the kitchen force. If this is done, it frequently hap- 
pens that some part of it is neglected and each man claims that he is 
not responsible. 

No kitchen can be managed successfully unless each man knows 
what is expected of him. Should there be a failure on the part of 
anyone to perform his share of work, the responsibility should be 
fixed at once and punishment follow immediately. 

Only those articles and cooking utensils being used in the kitchen 
or dining room should be kept by the mess sergeant. Other articles 
should be turned over to the supply sergeant so that they may be 
held in reserve to replace similar ones that may later become un- 
serviceable. Moreover these surplus articles must be kept clean 
and this requires unnecessary labor. 

Kitchens and adjoining rooms must be kept clean at all times. 
Such things as empty boies and crates should not be allowed to 



96 MANUAL FOB ABMY COOKS. 

iw^citmulate. They litter up the storerooms and cellars and are 
very unsightly. 

In cleaning shelves which are located in tiers, it is always best to 
commence with the topmost tier and work down. Otherwise the 
fihelves underneath will be littered in cleaning those above. 

The men should not spend all their time scouring the outside of 
boilers, pots, and pans. Let them spend some of that energy on the 
Inside. The parts of the kitchen utensils which come in contact 
with the food are the most important and should receive the first 
and greatest attention. See to it that the inside of meat choppers 
and faucets on boilers are thoroughly cleaned, that the inside of 
bake pans, frying pans, boilers, and dish pans are well scoured, that 
the tines of forks and the junction of the blades and handles of 
inives and steels are clean — ^then attack the other parts. A kitchen 
may look very well to a superficial observer dmd still be extremely 
insanitary. 

Each dish placed upon the table should be accompanied by a 
knife, fork, spoon, or ladle with which to serve the food contained 
therein. Men should not be allowed to serve themselves using their i 
individual knives, forks, or spoons. Such a practice is not only^, 
disgusting but is a medium through which disease is transmitted* 
from one person to another. 

In cutting meat preparatory to serving, it should be held by a 
fork and not the hand, and after cutting, it should be transferred 
irom the cutting board to the serving platters by the use of forks, 
skimmers, or other suitable utensils. The meat should never be 
handled with the hands. Frequently men put their hands in the 
lard in remo\dng it from the tubs. This should not be permitted. 
Men who do such things are usually those who do not practice 
personal cleanliness and must be watched carefully in order to pre- 
vent them from transmitting disease to others. 

Food that is liable to deteriorate should not be purchased in large 
quantities. In purchasing perishable articles, such as green onions, 
lettuce, radishes, etc., a supply ior only one meal should be bought. 
Such vegetables are best when first picked. 

Unless flour, corn meal, and other cereals can be kept in sealed 
metal containers, they should be purchased in lota sufficient only 
for three or four days. The accumulation of a large supply is apt to 



MANUAL FOR ABMY COOKS. 97 

result in loss because of rats and mice. In summer fresh meat should 
be purchased in small quantities. 

The warm weather of spring causes onions to sprout, particularly 
those that have been stored for some time. If not trimmed, these 
sprouts will sap the strength of the onion and render the vegetable 
useless. Cutting the sprouts helps to preserve onions. Furthermore 
the cut sprouts may advantageously be used in the kitchen in the 
preparation of soups, stews, hash, etc. 

Whenever celery is served the tops should be cut off and used for 
seasoning. The cut tbps may be placed in a paper bag and permitted 
to dry out. When dry they crumble like dead leaves but do not 
lose their strength for seasoning purposes. 

Every effort should be made to keep flies out of the kitchen, 
dining room, and storerooms. They live and breed in places of 
filth where the germs of many diseases are most numerous. They 
light in germ-laden filth, a part of which clings to their feet and 
is .carried away on them. The fly afterwards Lights on the food 
and contaminates it with this filth and disease. In this way dys- 
entery, diarrhea, typhoid fever, and other diseases are transmitted. 
Screening of doors and windows is absolutely necessary'-, and it is 
important to keep the screens closed whenever it is possible to do 
80 and to keep the vicinity of the screen doors free from anything 
that attracts flies. Flies avoid dark places, and for that reason the 
dining room and kitchen should be kept darkened whenever it is 
convenient. AVhen the police of the dining room is finished, it 
should be darkened. 

All food in the kitchen and pantry should be kept covered when- 
ever practicable, and all floors, tables, and table and kitchen ware 
should be cleaned after being used and should be kept free at all 
times possible from anything that attracts flies. Garbage stands 
should be kept whitewashed and the .cans covered. The ground 
around the kitchen should be always so well policed that flies will 
not gather there. 

Properly constructed flytraps are very effective in keeping down 
the flies. In camp they may be destroyed by burning out, with a 
torch after nightfall, the sides and roof of the' kitchen tent. If the 
kitrhen is darkened by drawing all the shades except one, which 
is ko})t raised about a foot, the flies gather on the lighted window 



ye MANUAL FOB ARMY COOKS. 

sill and may be easily killed . A poison that kills flies but is harmless 
to man is made by placing in a shallow dish a solution of 2 ounces 
of water, a little sugar, and 1 dram of bichromate of potash. 

It is important to kill the first flies of the season. One fly in May 
will probably have a peck of descendants by September; therefore 
he should be destroyed before he can commence to breed. 

Rats, mice, and cockroaches are also carriers of difease and filth 
and destroyers of property. Like flies, they travel in filth and carrv 
it on their feet to everything they touch. Unlike flies, they seek 
dark places where germs are most numerous. A good cat is the best 
protection against rats and mice. Cockroaches come out after dark 
and may be killed with a fly swatter, and also may be kept in check 
by means of roach powders sold on the market. 

Considerable labor may be saved by the use of a piece of canvas 
6 feet wide and from 10 to 14 feet long. After each meal has been 
served and the utensils emptied, the canvas is spread in front of 
the sink and all the utensils to be washed are placed thereon. 
Each utensil after being washed is returned to its proper place and 
the canvas taken up and hung out in the air. This not only pro- 
tects the floor from sooty pots and boilers but also from grease that 
may fall from pans and from the sink. 

272. Duties of the cooks. — In the absence of the mess sergeant, the 
first cook assumes his duties and responsibilities. Acting under the 
direction of the mess sergeant, he is responsible for the proper prepa- 
ration of the food. 

The other cooks are under the orders of the mess sergeant and the 
first cook. 

During the service of the meals the cooks remain in the kitchen and 
serve the food to the dining-room orderly and cooks' police, who act 
as waiters. 

The cooks take turns in getting up to prepare breakfast and the one 
who prepares it may be excused from afternoon kitchen duty. 

After breakfast the cook on duty sweeps out the oVen, cleans the 
range and boilers, washes off the kitchen table, and, assisted by the 
kitchen police, scrubs or mops the kitchen floor. 

273- Suggestions to cooks. — In order to work rapidly and spare 
himself unnecessary movements the cook should understand the 
recipe on which he is working. , It is not necessary for him to re- 
member all the recipes in the book. After the bill of fare is made

100 MANUAL FOE ARMY COOKS. 

out for the day he will save time and labor by sitting down, carefully 
reading it over, and getting into his head the necessary plan for all 
the details. There is nothing gained by starting work without a 
well-laid plan. 

The cook should think of what he is going to do, remember how he 
<iid it before, and then try to do it a little better. He should observe 
ho w others do the same thing and, if possible, try to avoid all unneces- 
sary movements in order to accomplish the most with the least 
possible work. 

It is necessary to have a place for each utensil and to keep it there. 
Articles to be used, including most of the kitchen utensils and the 
food being prepared, should be placed within easy reach of the cook 
iirhen standing in front of the kitchen range. In this way many 
unnecessary steps are saved. 

When preparing cake much labor is saved by collecting all the 
necessary articles before beginning the mixing. Place these articles 
on the table at which the work is to be done, and before commencing 
work regulate the fire in the range . This is imperative for the reason 
that after getting the hands in the batter there is no time to collect 
articles and put coals on the fire. This applies also to all dishes pre- 
pared in the kitchen. 

When getting ready to baste meat the cook often opens the oven 
•door and pulls the pan out with a jerk, splashing some of the gravy in 
the oven and some on the floor. The door must then be scrubbed , and 
the grease which has fallen in the oven will burn and permeate the 
kitchen with a disagreeable odor and, in addition, the pans put in the 
stove thereafter will be soiled because of the unclean condition of the 
oven. More labor is used in cleaning the pans soiled by an unclean 
oven than is required to keep the oven clean. 

Frequently a sooty boiler or pan is placed on the kitchen table or 
the draining board of a sink. A spot is left which must be removed 
at once. This may be avoided by the use of a board or rack on 
i^hich sooty utensils can rest. Such a rack can easily be made 
by using five pine sticks | inch by 1 inch by 18 inches. Place two 
of them parallel to each other and about 14 inches apart. Across 
these nail the other three at intervals of about 6^ inches. Such a 
rack may be hung under the drain board of the sink when not 
■wanted and, if needed, is immediately available. 



MANUAL FOE ARMY COOKS, 101 

When frying on the range, grease is often spilled upon the wood- 
work around the stove and on the kitchen floor. These grease spots 
should be removed at once by the use of plenty of hot water and soap. 
Not attending to this immediately results in spreading grease over 
the woodwork and more work in the end . 

Spoons or other utensils used for stirring food should not be placed 
on the mantel of the range or the kitchen table. A plate should be 
placed on the table or mantel for the spoon to rest in. When a 
spoon or fork is taken from food on the stove a cloth should be held 
under it to catch the drippings. 

In cutting meats good results can be obtained only by the use of 
sharp cutting utensils. Satisfactory and rapid work can not be 
accomplished with dull knives. The thumb should be held against 
the back of the knife, as this lessens the fatigue of the wrist and 
enables one to work more rapidly than if the thumb clasps the knife. 
Each kitchen should be provided with a good grindstone. 

The plate and knife of the meat chopper should be kept closely 
together by means of the ring nut. If this is not done, particles of 
meat will edge in between the knife and plate and cause a ragged 
tearing of the meat. Often men loosen the ring nut with the idea 
that the handle can be more easily turned. Such is not the case, 
however, as the particles of meat torn off clog the chopper. 

In trimming fat from meat no lean meat should be cut off with it. 
While rendering, the lean meat yields nothing but water and conse- 
quently becomes a total loss. In this regard it is better to allow some 
of the fat to remain on the meat, for during the cooking of the meat 
the drippings are caught in the pan and enrich the gravy prepared 
with the meat, or are skimmed from the stock in which the meat is 
boiled. 

Gravy should be prepared in the pan in which the meat has been 
cooked. Some of the albuminous substances escape from the meat 
in the process of cooking and settle on the bottom of the pan. These 
idd a fluA or to the gra^•y that is not obtained if the drippings are 
Iraincd into anotlier pun and thegravy made in the latter. To the 
jarticles escaping from the meat should be achled sufficient beef 
itock and flour to make a gravy of the proper onsistenf-y. During 
)rcparation, the gravy should be frequently stirred with a whip, in 
>rder to loosen the particles from the bottom of the pan. Where 



102 MANUAL FOB ARMY COOKS. 

the meat cooked is very fat, excess drippings should be drained from 
the pan before the gravy is made. 

If several pans are used for roasting, after the meat has been 
removed the drippings should be poured into one pan. Into the 
emptied pans should be poured either beef stock or hot water, which 
when brought to a boil and agitated with a wire whip will loosen the 
meat residue left on the bottom of the pans during roasting. 

As a general rule food should be seasoned during the process of 
cooking. Cooks must be careful in the use of salt, especially in pre- 
paring hashes, meat balls, and stews from food that has been left 
over. The left-overs are from food which has previously been seasoned 
and, unless great care is taken, dishes subsequently prepared from 
them will be too salty. It must be borne in mind that it is better 
to put in too little salt than too much, because more may be added to 
the food in the dining room according to taste. 

Buns and rolls for supper are usually baked by 1 p. m. They 
are then spread on tables to cool, a process that ordinarily does not 
require more than one hour. If they are left exposed until 5.30 
or 6 p. m., they become hard and partly dried out. If, however, 
after being cooled, they are placed on their sides in a tightly closed 
boiler, they will remain soft and nutty, not only for supper but for 
the following breakfast. Not more than three tiers of buns or rolls 
should be placed in a boiler. 

The following suggestions regarding the cooking of vegetables 
will be found useful: 

(a) Cook green vegetables rapidly in boiling salt water, the time 
allowed depending on the vegetable cooked. All vegetables should 
be carefully drained after boiling. 

(6) It is a good rule to use only enough water to cover the vege- 
tables. If it evaporates, add more boiling water. Sulphuroufi 
vegetables, however, should be well immersed in water, otherwise 
they will be tough and discolored and their flavor changed. 

(c) Vegetables are best when freshly gathered. If slightly wilted, 
soak them in cold water. Even when not wilted such soaking 
improves them, as it renders them more crisp and palatable . Onions, 
cabbages, and cauliflower, if soaked for one hour before cooking, are 
less objectionable in odor. t. -i j • 

(d) Onions, cabbages, and cauliflower should be boiled in ai| 
uncovered pot and the water changed at least once while cookiiig 
A pinch of soda may be added to the water. ! 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 103 

I (e) Beans and peas should be strung or shelled and washed quickly 
If cold water is allowed to stand on them very long, it removes much 
of their nutrtious quality. 

(/) Care must be taken not to break the skins of beets, as much 
^of the coloring matter will escape in cooking. 

(g) Carrots should be scraped and turnips pared before cooking. 
Both should be sliced thin. 

(h) After husking green corn all the silk should be removed from 
the ears. Corn should not be washed. It should be eaten the day 
it is pulled. 

.(}) Young potatoes should be scraped and old ones peele'd. If 
boiled potatoes, after draining, are allowed to remain on the range 
a few minutes, with the lid off the boiler, their flavor will be much 
improved. 

(;■) Spinach should be thoroughly washed in several waters to 
insure the removal of the grit. After cooking, drain in a colander 
and dress with melted butter, pepper, and salt. 

(k) Insects are likely to gather in the hearts of cabbages. If the 
heads are to be cooked whole, put them in the water head down to 
remove the insects. 

(l^ Small parsnips may be cooked whole; if large, they should be 
cut lengthwise. To keep the flesh from darkening, remove al! 
specks and trim off the fine roots. 

Personal cleanliness of cooks^ is of the greatest importance. A 
bath should be taken daily, especially in the tropics. The follow- 
ing system has been found satisfactory: After breakfast, work is 
begun on that part of the dinner which demands inmiediate atten- 
tion, or which litters up the kitchen in the course of preparation; 
iand as soon as the dinner is ready to put on — about 8 or 8.30 a. m. — 
I the first cook takes a bath and changes his clothes. His underwear — 
^especially in the tropics — should be changed at this time. As soon 
j^as the first cook has returned — about 8.30 or 9 a. m. — ^the second cook 
['goes for his bath and returns half an hour later. 

274. Cooks' clothing. — Each cook should be provided with the 
following clothing : 

Four white coats. 
Six pairs white trousers. 
Four white skull caps. 
Twelve white aprons. 



104 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

TVhen serving in the tropica or when the climate is such that the 
coat is not worn, cooks should be required to appear at all times 
in white undershirts. They should not be allowed to enter the 
dining room at meal time without wearing a white coat. 

275. Duties of the dining-room orderly. — He should be detailed 
monthly. He is under the orders of the mess sergeant, and is held 
responsible for the cleanliness of the dining room and pantry and 
for the dishes and utensils used therein. 

Upon assuming charge, the mess sergeant will verify with him all 
the dishes and other equipment for which he will be held responsible. 
A strict account is kept by him in a book provided for the purpose of 
all the breakage that occurs and he reports to the mess sergeant the 
names of the men responsible for the breakage. Upon being re- 
lieved, all breakage unaccounted foi; is charged a^inst him. 

He reports at the dining room not later than 10 minutes before 
mess call. He then cuts the bread into thin slices and piles it neatly 
upon plates, one of which is provided for each table. During the 
service of the meal he remains in the bread room, cuts the bread, and 
gives it to the waiters as they call for it. Toward the end of the meal 
he should be careful not to issue more than he thinks will be used. 
After each meal he gathers up the food left on the platters and returns 
it to the kitchen for future use. 

Slices of bread not consumed are piled as closely as possible to 
prevent the exposure of the crumb to the air and consequent drying 
out. They are placed in the bread box and served first at the next 
meal. Crumbs of bread accumulating in the pantry and bread box 
are saved and disposed of by the mess sergeant. 

He takes charge of all work in the dining room and, assisted by the 
cooks' police, clears the tables after each meal. He then brushes off 
the tables, scrubs them with hot water and soap, rinses them with 
clean water, and dries them. He then cleans the saltcellars, pepper- 
boxes, vinegar cruets, mustard pots, and sugar bowls and fills them 
for the next meal. 

After breakfast he places the stools on the tables with legs up, 
sweeps and mops or scrubs the dining-room floor, using but little 
water, and carefully dries it. After dinner and supper he sweeps the 
dining room. As soon as the floor is dry he sets the tables and aligns 
the stools in their proper places, being careful to make the tables 
present as clean ana neat an appearance as possible. 



MANUAL FOB ARMY GOOKS. 105 

* He dusts off the woodwork and radiators each morning, and if 
I necessary uses soap and water to remove any dirt that has accu- 
l mulated. 

[i He keeps the pantry neat and clean and all surplus dishes neatly 
r arranged upon the shelves. 

s He is responsible for the cleanliness of the dishes and silverware, 

- and sees that plenty of boiling water, heated on the top of the range, 

is provided for rinsing them. Water from the reservoir is not hot 

enough for rinsing dishes. 

y Each Friday he gives the pantry and dining room a thorough 

f cleaning, washing the stools, windows, bread boxes, shelves, and 

; all surplus dishes and tableware. After scrubbing, the bread box 

should be dried and sunned for an hour or more. 

If sirup is to be served for breakfast, he sees that the pitchers are 
filled on the preceding evening. If butter is to be served, he gets it 
ready for the table, but in warm weather he does not take it from the 
' ' ice box until the meal is about to be served. 

■ 276. Duties of the cooks' police. — Thev are under the orders of the 
" mess sergeant and the cOok in charge and report to the mess sergeant 
not later than 10 minutes before mess call. 

They serve all meals imder the direction of the mess sergeant and 
wait upon the tables at meal time. 

One of the cooks' police washes the kitchen utensils and the others 
assist the dining-room orderly in clearing the tables. The cooks' 
police and dining-room orderly then wash the dishes and knives, 
forks, and spoons, the work being under the charge of the dining-room 
orderly. 

The knives, forks, and spoons are placed in a dish pan with plenty 
of hot water and left until all the dishes have been washed. They 
are then washed clean, scalded with boiling water (to which a little 
soap is added), and carefully wiped with a dry, clean towel. 

Dishes are washed in the sink or a dish pan, using plenty of soap, 
well dissolved and beaten into suds. In order to dispose of the 
cleaner and less greasy articles first, they are washed in the following 
order: Cups, saucers, plates, and other dishes. After washing, dishes 
must be scalded, either by placing them on edge on the drain board 
and pouring hot water over them, or, if the drain board is too small for 
this, by dipping them in a pan of hot water. Good results are obtained 



106 IklANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

only by using plenty of soap in the dishwater and clean, hot rinsing 
water and plenty of clean, dry towels. 

After washing the breakfast dishes, all soiled dish towels are placed 
in a boiler of hot, soapy water and boiled for 30 minutes. They 
are then washed (preferably on a washboard), rinsed, and dried. 
After dinner and supper the towels used in wiping the dishes are 
washed out in hot water and soap, rinsed in clean water, and dried. 

After putting the dishes away the cooks' police will clean the sink 
and sweep and mop the floor. They then report to the mess ser- 
geant for such work as may be assigned them — peeling potatoes, 
carrying coal, washing windows, etc. 

When the services of the cooks' police can be spared for this pur- 
pose, the mess sergeant may direct them to assist the dining-room 
orderly in mopping out the dining room and washing the tables. 

The cooks' police will not absent themselves from the kitchen 
except by authority of the mess sergeant or the cook in charge. 

277. Care of equipment. — Balce pans should never be scraped or 
sdoured, as this removes the bronze or bluing. They should be 
washed with soap and water, wiped dry, and hung on the back of 
the range with S hooks. 

Boilers. — Each time boilers are used, except for boiling water, they 
should be scoured out with Sapolio or wood ashes, thoroughly rinsed 
with clean water, dried, and sunned. 

Boilers for coffee. — They should be scoiu'ed with wood ashes or Sapo- 
lio once each day. Many cooks remove a portion only of the conee 
grounds after each cooking, always leaving a portion in the pot. 
Good coffee can never be made in this manner. All the strengtn is 
not extracted at the first cooking, and it is best to allow the grains to 
accumulate in the boiler for three meals (unless tea is used for one 
meal of the day, in which case the coffee should not be carried over), 
and then remove the entire lot. Although there is some waste of 
coffee by this method, it is a great deal better than any other and 
the coffee is always good.

The No. 1 eye gives off the greatest radiation of heat; the No. 2 
next; Nos. 3 and 3a, and 4 and 4a, next; and Nos. 5 and 5a the least' 
It is very important that cooks understand the heat surface of the 
range they are working over. Articles to be boiled should be placed 
on the No. 1 eye. Should it be desired to have these simmer, the 
boilers must be removed to eyes No. 5 or 5a. Old tough meat, 
which requires a long slow process of cooking, can here be sim- 
mered until cooked, without tear of burning. For a moderate heat 
eyes 3, 3a, 4, and 4a can be used to advantage. Stewing requires a 
gentle heat, applied a long time. By this process the coarsest kinds 
of meat can be made tender when allowed to simmer on the No. 5 
eye, with even a moderate fire in the range. 

Dining-room floors. — They should be swept after each meal,, 
mopped out each morning, and scrubbed once or twice each week. 

Dining-room tables. — They should be scrubbed after each meal 
with soap or Sapolio and hot water. In this way stains can be 
removed with less labor and scouring material and the tables kept in 
better condition than if scrubbed once a day. 

Dishes, tableware, etc. — See duties of dining-room orderly and of 
cooks' police. 

Jars for yeast. — As soon as the jar becomes empty scour with sand 
and hot water. Rinse well and half fill with boiling water. Cover 
tightly and allow it to stand for an hour. Empty it and it is ready 
for use. Soap, lye, or Sopolio should not be used for cleaning the 
jar. If portions of these are left in the jars they are likely to injure 
the yeast. 

Kitchen floors. — The flushing of floors is prohibited by Army 
Regulations, but they should be thoroughly scrubbed each morning. 
Whenever a grease spot appears on the floor it should be scrubbed 
out, using the scrubbing brush and plenty of soap or lye. After 



108 MANUAL FOB ARMY COOKS. 

dinner and supper the floors are mopped. Always sweep the floor 
thoroughly before mopping or scrubbing. In scrubbing use one-half 

Eound of soap dissolved in from 6 to 10 gallons of boiling water. In 
irger kitchens from 10 to 15 gallons of the soap-and-water mixture 
may be required. Dip the brush in the mixture, scrub cjuickly, 
and, dry with a mop, which should be constantly rinsed in clean 
water. WTien a patent wjinger is available, about three ounces of 
lye should be used with a half pound of soap. The lye injures the 
hands if mops are used without the wringer. 

Kitchen tables. — They should be scrubbed with soap and water 
after each meal. Boiling linseed oil should be well rubbed into 
them once in each two or three months. 

Range. — Each morning before cleaning the kitchen, sweep out 
the ovens and rub off the range with a greasy cloth. A greasy cloth 
applied daily keeps the range in better condition than stove polish 
applied once a week. Once a week the range should be thoroughly 
cleared out. To do this, remove the top and sweep off the oven, 
protecting the casing plates. Remove the soot by a scraper tlirough 
the flue doors. The mantel should be wiped often with a damp 
cloth and when necessary washed with soap and water. This 
prevents dishes from picking up dirt and grease and thus soiling the 
tables. 

Scales and weights.— They should be wiped off with a greasy cloth 
to prevent rusting. 

Small tinware, etc. — Tin, zinc, and galvanized ware should be 
cleaned with soap, Sapolio, or ashes and kept in their places when 
not in use. Small tinware that is in constant use should be scoured 
at least once a day, dried, and kept in a dry place. 

Stools. — They should be wiped with a clean damp cloth after each 
meal and should be washed with soap and water each week. 

278. Serving the meal. — A meal, however well prepared, must be 
served properly to give satisfaction and to prevent unnecessary 
waste. This requires a system by which everything is brought 
on the table hot or cold, as intended. All of the tables must be 
served promptly and in an orderly manner. This requires every 
man of the kitchen detail to perform properly the particular duties 
assigned to him.

110 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

Five minutes before mess call the coffee (or other beverage), 
bread, and soup must be placed on the mess tables (the soup in 
1 -gallon tureens to tables of 10 men) and the salad and dessert on 
the bread table. 

The dinner is now readv, and the mess sergeant goes into the 
dining room to superintend the service. The cooks remain in the 
kitchen and serve the food to the waiters as they come for it. 

The food, after being cooked, must be arranged on clean platters, 
vegetable dishes, etc. The outside of these dishes must be kept 
clean and all drippings of sirup, gravy, etc., removed from them. 

The table must be set with care and kept scrupulously neat. 
Order in the dining room and conduct at the table are influenced 
by the care with which arrangements are made for the reception of 
the men. 

All the men at each table must finish their soup before the re- 
mainder of the meal is served at that table. The mess sergeant 
not only superintends the service, but personally assists and sees 
that all are served properly and without delay or confusion. 

It often happens that while those at the first tables served are 
ready for dessert, those at the other tables are in the midst of the 
meal, or possibly still eating their soup. Constant supervision is 
therefore necessary to see that the service is prompt and orderlv. 

As the men finish at each table it is cleared off, the food left 
being transferred to other tables or returned to the kitchen, and the 
dishes placed in the sink for washing. 

When all have finished their dinner the food still remaining on 
the serving trays is returned to the kitchen and the bill of fare 
is made out for supper, care being taken to use, if practicable, all 
the food left over from breakfast and dinner. At the same time 
the bills of fare are prepared for breakfast and dinner for the fol- 
lowing day. The waste collected from the plates should not fill 
more than a quarter of an ordinary bucket. The men should be 
given all they will eat, but should not be permitted to take on 
their plates more than they are going to eat. Each man may help 
himself as often as he likes, but waste of food must be met witn 
prompt punishment. After a few punishments there will be no 
further trouble. The men will see the benefit derived from careful 
management and ecoifomy and will appreciate the good results they 
themselves have helped to obtain.

For keeping articles of food hot and in shape to serve for hours; or for slow cooking 
after the food has been brought to the boiling point. Lima beans, stews, soups, 
coffee, sauces, etc., should be lilted from the range when thev have come to a boil 
and set in the large pan, which should contain about 1 inch of boiling water. Tough 
steaks and cooked meats may be kept in boilers set in the pan for hours to great 
advantage, as the action is practically the same as that of a flreless cooker. The 
warming device is not supplied to troops and must be purchased from the funds if 
desired. The same principle may be applied by using a dish pan and a jar or small 
boiler.

Chapter VI. 

FIELD COOKING. 

279. The regulations require that on the march, in concentration 
or maneuver camp, or in the field, the savings privilege be suspended 
and the troops subsisted on the ration in kind. It is also provided 
that the commanding officer will designate the ration to be issued to 
the troops, but that it shall not exceed the amount of any component 
authorized in garrison. 

To prevent waste there must be even closer supervision in camp 
than in garrison, especially when the individual mess kit is used. 
rEach man is served from the issuing table and the general tendency 
is to issue too freely, the men taking away more than they will eat. 
The food left on the mess kit is wasted. The mes^ ; ?rgeant should 
closely supervise this issue and insist that the cooks and the dining- 
|oom orderly use care and judgment when servdng. Through close 
-observation the mess sergeant and the cooks may learn the proper 
portions for each individual. 

280. In permanent camp. — The conveniences of a long-established 
camp gradually approach those of garrison, and where careful super- 
vision is exercised, troops fare well. The savings privilege is often 
panted by special authorty of the War Department to troops serving 
m permanent camp. Fresh beef may be supplied regularly and the 
bills of fare are much the same as in garrison. The dining-room 
arrangements are more simple and the kitchen work is greatly 
reduced because each man looks after his own individual mess kit. 

With the improvised bake ovens mentioned herein, plenty of 
rolls, buns, and biscuits can be baked. 

Flies are a pest in warm weather and in all camps of the least 
degree of permanence, the kitchen and dining room should be 
jcreened. When this is not feasible, a screened cage may be made 
Ji which to keep the food. Coal oil should be freely used about the 

113 



114 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

refuse cans to keep away flies and destroy their larva. The field 
expedients mentioned later are especially useful in permanent camp. 

281. In temporary camp. — In a temporary camp — of from 5 to 10 
days — the cooking is very much the same as in permanent camp. 
Meals are served to the men in the same manner and the same care 
must be exercised in the prevention of waste. In hot or wet weather 
a fly should be stretched over the range and the rations carefully 
protected. Frequently the escort wagon in which the rations are 
carried may be used for the storage of mess supplies, and a tent fly 
should then be put up for the protection of the cooks and food before 
issue. When possible a wall tent and fly should be used in place of 
the arrangement just indicated. 

Though not absolutely necessary where the range is supplied, an 
excavation should be made in windy weather for the protection of 
the fire when an open grate is used. A pit 1 foot deep, with the 
additional protection afforded by the earth thrown upon the sides, 
will be ample. 

282. On the march. — The savings privilege is suspended and the 
ration is designated by the commanding officer. The regulations 
require the issues to be made daily. The table given in paragraph 
197, showing the quantities of the component and suostitutive 
articles allowed from 1 to 1,000 rations, will prove invaluable. 

The quartermaster of the troops should, if practicable, arrange in/ 
advance for the supply of fresh meat and bread along the route. 
If it can not be done, such quantity of fresh meat, dependent upon,; 
the weather, as can be carried without danger of spoiling, should, 
be taken along. ; 

Several days' supply of fresh bread may be carried under favorably , 
conditions. A fiela bakery unit and personnel may be attached tOj 
a command the size of a regiment. 

The above measures insure the two most important components 
of the ration for a few days, but bacon, canned meats, hard bread, 
and dried vegetables must be used on the march almost to the exclu- , I 
sion of these more bulky components. Dried vegetables and canned J 
goods are convenient on account of their small bulk and the ease jj 
with which they can be transported. J 

There is little time in the morning to prepare breakfast and no r 
attempt should be made to have a great variety. A few com- " 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 115 

ponents, good and substantial, including plenty of coffee, are about 
ia much as can be provided. Upon arrival in camp it is necessary 
to get a quick meal, as the men are usually tired and hungry. The 
Idea is to have something prepared quickly as a lunch. A fire 
should be started at once to neat water for coffee, which, with some 
form of canned meat and bread, is sufficient. Then, while the com- 
pany is making camp the cooks have ample time to prepare the 
Daain meal of the day, which is usually served in the late afternoon. 
The following bill of fare is suggested as an example of what 
might be prepared for one day on the march: 

BREAKFAST. 

Fried bacon or beefsteak, boiled potatoes, bread, and coffee. 

LUNCH OS ARRIVAL IX CAMP. 

Canned corned beef or fried bacon or canned salmon, cold canned tomatoes, hard 
X fresh bread, and coffee. 

DINNER. 

Soup, boiled or roast beef, or other boiled or roasted meat, mashed potatoes, peas, 
X)m or succotash, bread, and coffee. 

The improvised fireless cooker described in this chapter has been, 
ised to advantage on the march. 

283. In campaign. — Troops subsist on the field ration. This 

ation is prescribed in orders by the commander of the field forces, 

nd consists of the reserve ration in whole or in part supplemented 

•y articles of food procured locally or brought from the rear. It is 

ontemplated that sufficient articles of food will be added to make 

his reserve ration equal the garrison ration, when practicable. 

The arrangements for messing are dependent upon conditions and ' 

ibject to many changes. These may approximate the arrange- 

lents in permanent camp or on the march where the company 

lesses as a unit or the men may be required to cook individually, 

when on patrol or in the presence of the enemy. It is best as a 

easure of economv and health to prepare the food for the organiza- 

on as a whole rather than to issue it out to individuals or groups. 

xperience proves that the organization fares best when all members 

e present and the ration is handled by experienced men. This 



116 MANUAL FOE ARMY COOKS. 

applies to the present field ration more than to any previously 
authorized. 

The bills of fare will be simple and the mess sergeant and cooks are 
compelled to use their utmost ingenuity to provide a variety. It is 
■considered impracticable to suggest a bill of fare for the field, 
because the ration varies at different times from the reserve to the 
iull garrison ration. 

FIELD RANGES. 

284. The Army field range No. 1, complete, as described herein 
-weighs approximately 264 pounds with utensils, and with the addi- 
tion of the Alamo attachment is designed to cook for 150 men. It 
consists essentially of two parts, viz: the oven No. 41 and the boiling 
plate. The boiling plate nas three sections, No. 42 and two other 
parts, forming the Alamo attachment No. 42A and 42B. 

To pack the utensils and range for transportation, place the bake 
pan No. 52 on the ground. Set boiler No. 50 inside of bake pan No. 
52; boiler No. 51 inside of boiler No. 50. Place tent guards ii)side of 
boiler No. 51 on bottom. Telescope the 4 joints of pipe. Inside of 
the pipe place 2 forks, 3 knives, 1 sharpener, 1 cleaver, and 2 
folding lanterns. Place joints of pipe containing utensils inside of 
boiler No. 51. Place meat chopper in boiler No. 51 alongside of 
joints of pipe. Place 2 basting spoons, 1 meat saw, and 1 skimmer in 
boiler No. 51 on top of pipe. Cover with lid No. 51, then No. 50. 
Place bake pan No. 52 upside down over lid No. 50. Care should be 
taken that oake-pan handles are well down to sides of the pan 
Nest 4 boilers Nos. 48, 49, 53, and 54, No. 48 outside. Place stove^ 
pipe elbow in No. 54. Place dippers alongside of elbow. Place 
covers Nos. 54, 53, 49, and 48 on boilers in order named. Place nested 
oilers Nos. 48, 49, 53, and 54 in rear end of oven. Place bake pans 
h^d nested boilers in front end of oven. Close the oven door and 
lock with damper lock. Place 42A on left front corner of oven Nos. 41 
and 42B on right front comer, inserting bar in crimp. This bar now 
rests against the pipe collar and prevents sliding. Place boiling plate 
No. 42 on top of range, eye fitting over stovepipe flange and engaging 
under the flat hook. Make secure by fastening hook on front of 
boiling plate to the lug on back of range. The range is now secure for 
transportation.

MANUAL FOB ARMY COOKS. 117 

285. Installing the range. — (See par. 295.) On the march the range 
is ordinarily set up by simply leveling the ground selected and 
placing the oven No. 41 and boiling plate No. 42 side by side, so that 
the oven door and fire-box door will be at the same end . Draw in 42A 
and 42B and secure bar-lock. Insert 42 A into 42 and rest 42B snugly 
on the angle iron on the rear of the range. The oven should not be 
banked, as this would cause the sheet iron along the sides to warp and 
finally bum through. Sufficient earth, however, should be tamped 
alongthesidesand closed end to prevent the passage of gases beneath. 
This earth should not extend above the straps along the sides and 
under the oven door. 

When used for one day only it will be unnecessary to dig a trench, 
but if a few shovelfuls of earth are removed from the place to be covered 
by the boiling plate it will facilitate firing. The best results are ob- 
tained by using short wood — keeping the fire well toward the firing 
end of the boiling plate — or, if using long sticks and branches, 
pushing them under the boiling plate as they are consumed. 

286. Trenching. — If the range is to remain in place for several days, 
prepare trench as shown in par. 295. 

287. When the range is set up on different ground daily no diffi- 
culty will be experienced in obtaining the proper temperature in 
the oven, both for top and bottom heat. Whenever it remains for 
a longer time than one day in the same spot, the ground will become 
dried out and hot, and it may be necessary to elevate the bake pans 
Slightly above the floor of the oven, thereby leaving an air space 
under the pans. This can be done by the use of angle irons or other 
means. Never use earth or sand on the bottom of the oven chamber, 
for by so doing a hole will soon be burned in the bottom plate. 

I To install the range on a railroad car or on a wooden floor, see para- 
graph 816. 

288. Brick fire box. — The trench may be eliminated by installing 
;he range on a brick wall about 8 inches thick and 3 bricks high. 
5et up the range temporarily and mark on the ground the outline 
)f the oven. Alamo attachment, and boiling plate. Build the wall 
)n the outline and on the line between the oven and boiling plate, 
he wall extending about 4 inches on each side of the outime, so that 
he base of the range will rest on the center of the wall. Then set 
^p the range on the wall and fill up with earth or brick the space 



118 MANUAL FOE ARMY COOKS. 

under the oven, except about 6 inches at the rear end. Bank the 
outside of the' wall with earth. 

In a permanent camp (see par, 29Q) it is frequently necessary to 
evaporate waste under the range and to consume the garbage by the 
same fire. In this case dig a pit about 4 feet long, 3i feet wide, and 
2 feet deep, to give a reservoir for waste water. Fill the pit with 
cobblestones, leaving a fire box and a gas chamber under boiling 
plate and Alamo attachment as suggested for temporary installation. 
Place a length of stovepipe or any kind of chute at a convenient place 
anywhere along the side of the oven, arranging the rocks on which it 
rests so that there will be & free passage for the water. Pour in the 
waste water as it accumulates, retaining all solid matter with a wire 
screen. The solid matter is burned in the trench under the boiling 
plate, a little at a time, after the meal has been prepared. 

289. Reassembling for transportation. — WTien reassembling for 
transportation, draw boiling plate No. 42 forward. Unfasten bar 
lock, pull apart, and removQ 42A and 42B and proceed as indicated 
above. 

290. Remarks on handling the range. — If properly installed, the 
oven will not be too hot on the bottom for ordinary baking, owing to 
the fact that the fire does not strike the range proper. A tin will be 
found inside the baking chamber, which may be used if for any 
reason the bottom of the oven is too hot. Should the bottom of the 
oven be too cold for efficient baking the tin should be removed. 
Articles brought to a boil on the boiling plate will continue to simmer 
if set on top of the oven or if placed alongside the oven . In this man- 
ner a dinner has been prepared for an entire battalion by adding the 
necessary utensils. A little care and judgment are necessary to 
secure satisfactory results. 

Coal should never be used when wood is obtainable. If possible, 
even when coal is used, part of the fuel should be wood, for the use 
of coal alone will quickly destroy the range. 

In permanent camp the space above and on the sides of the oven 
and the stovepipe should be cleaned at least once a week. This also 
applies to the boiling plates. The range, boiling plates, and pipes 
should be coated with a mixture of sugar and grease. This preser- 
vative preventa rust and gives a neat polished appearance to the 
range. 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 119 

291. Army field range No. 2. — The Army field ran^e No. 2, com- 
plete, weighs about 1.50 pounds with utensils and is designed to 
cook for 55 men. This range is without the Alamo attachment. It 
consists essentially of two parts — the oven, No. 61, and boiling plate, 
No. 62. For transportation the boiling plate is placed on top of the 
oven and the utensils (with flue) packed within the oven chamber. 
' 292. This range is installed in accordance with the principles 
explained for army field ran^e No. 1. It has no Alamo attkchment 
and the boiUng plate is attached, end to end, to the rear of the oven, 
the projecting collar of the boiling plate being slipped into the 
space cut from the rear end of the oven for that purpose. (See Par. 
294). The trench is dug under the boiling plate and extends about 
three inches under the rear end of the oven. 

293. To pack utensils and range for transportation place bake pan 
No. 52 on the ground. Set boiler No. 50 inside of bake pan No. 62; 
boiler No. 51 inside of boiler No, 50. Place tent guards on bottom 
of boiler No. 51. Telescope the 4 joints of stovepipe. Inside of 
pipe place 2 forks, 2 knives, 1 sharpener, 2 spoons, 1 lantern (folding), 
and 1 skimmer. Place the joints of pipe containing utensils in 
boiler No. 51. Place dipper and elbow alongside the "pipe. Place 
meat saw in bake pan No. 52 alongside the boilers. Cover boilers 
with lids No. 51 and No. 50. Place bake pan No. 52 up.^ide down 
Dver lid No. 50. Place pans in the range oven. Place the boihng 
alate at the door end of the oven. Engage the flanges on the inner 
tide of boiling plate with the lugs on the door end of the oven, 
^asten the hook on boiling piate (firing end) to lug above the handle 
m the closed end of oven. The range is now secure for transporta- 
ion.

FIRELE8S COOKERS. 



298. A flreless cooker is an air-tight receptacle for the slow prepara* 
tion of partly cooked food by heat stored up in the food, or mechan- 
ically introduced as when soapstones are used. It is also used to 
preserve the temperature of food cooked or uncooked. 

It is generally a box-like arrangement lined with a nonconducting 
material within which is the well or reservoir, into which the vessel 
containing the hot food is placed. 

Many different makes of fireless cookers are found on the market, 
and various material such as asbestos, paper felt, hay, indurated 
fiber, etc., are used as nonconductors. In some t}T)es heated soap- 
stones are placed in the well to keep the food at a cooking tempera- 
ture for long periods, or to supply the heat ordinarily given to the 
food before it is placed in the cooker. 

To cook food requires the application of a certain amount of heat 
at a temperature between 130° and 385° F. (in the case of fireless 
cookers, oetween 130° and 212°) though the lower the temperature 
the longer the process will be. 

The object of a fireless cooker is simply to use the heat above 130° 
F. which has been stored in the food to finish cooking it. 

The advantages are: The food may be served warm on the march 
or upon arrival m camp; it saves fuel; being a slow process it renders 
such food as tough meats tender and palatable; and the food, having 
been placed in the cooker, requires no further attention. 

To prepare food for cooking in the fireless cooker the general idea 
is to place food on the range and when sufficient heat has been stored 
up in it, to transfer the food directly to the cooker where cooking 
will continue as long as the temperature remains above 130° F.

125 



potatoes, parsnips, etc., should be about half cooked, the water 
drained off, and then put into the cooker. The vegetable is then 
allowed to finish cooking with its retained heat, remaining in the 
cooker for a few hours only. 
A considerable amount of acid is found in tomatoes, and dishes 

'Containing them should not be permitted to remain in the fireless 
cooker or other tin receptacles for longer than four or five hours. 
Coffee should be first prepared by boiling in a sack in the regular 

J boiler so that the grounds need not be placed in the cooker. 



299. 



IMPROVISED FIRELESS COOKER. 




Most satisfactory fireless cooker yet devised, which is a milic can placed within a 
water or ash can with hay or straw packed in between. In camp the large cans are 
used for w">ter and the small ones for cookiog, so that no unnecessary impedimenta 
is carried. 



126 MANUAL FOE ARMY COOKS. 

The type of fireless cooker shown has proven as efficient as any on 
the market and more convenient for field service. Those on the 
market are too heavy and bulky for field use and are not popular in 
garrison. 

Used as an improvised cooker, two of the water cans and two 
10-gallon milk cans will provide one meal of coffee and hot beans or 
beef stew for 80 men. Eight of these cans will supply lunch for 
about 300 men and, when loaded on an escort wagon, leave sufficient 
room for rations and equipage. 

The food can be prepared at the same time the cooks are preparing 
breakfast and placed in the cooker, which is loaded on the wagons, 
so as to be readily accessible when needed. 

300. ROLLING KITCHENS. 

There are several types on the market. Most of them consist of 
ranges or boilers mounted on running gears of carts or wagons, so 
that the cooking may be done while the kitchen is in motion. Many 
are also provided with separate wells or compartments constructed 
on the principle of the fireless cooker, in which the food, already 
cooked, mav be kept warm. 

These rolling kitchens or soup wagons are a great convenience to 
troops on the march or on the firing line, but considering the amount 
of transportation and road space they require, it is doubtful if they 
should be used except under special conditions, as where troops are 
occupying a more or less stationary firing line. 

301. INDIVIDUAL COOKING. 

Weights and measures. — It will oft«n be necessary to issue 
rations to men individually where there are no scales available. 
The ordnance cup will be found very convenient for determining 
weights under these conditions. The new regulation cup holds ij 
pints; the old cup holds seven-eighths of a quart.

SUGGESTIONS FOR HANDLING BIl^L OF FARE NO. 1. 



Take two-thirds of a cup of water and bring to a boil. Add 4 
spoonfuls of rice and boil until tender, i. e. until it can be mashed 
b^ the fingers with but little resistance. This requires about fifteen 
minutes. Add 2 pinches of salt, and after stirring, poiu* off the 
water and empty the rice out on the lid of the mess pan. 

Meanwhile, fry 3 slices of bacon until slightly browned in the mess 

{)an over a brisk fire or hot coals, and lay them on top of the rice, 
eaving sufficient grease in the pan in which to fry the flapjack. 
Take 6 spoonfuls of flour and one-third spoonful of baking powder 
and mix thoroughly. Add sufiicient cold water to make a batter 
that will drip freely from the spoon. Add a pinch of salt and 2 
pinches of sugar and pour the batter into the mess pan, which should 
contain the grease from the fried bacon. Place over medium hot 
coals and bake from 5 to 7 minutes; see that it will slip easily in the 
pan and then, by a ouick toss, turn it over and continue the baking 
from 5 to 7 minutes longer or until, by examination, it is found to 
be done. 

AMiiie the batter is frying, wash out the tin cup; two-thirds fill 
with water and let come to a boil. Add 1 medium heaping spoonful 
of coffee and stir well, and Ji desired, 1 spoonful of sugar and let boil 
for about 5 minutes. Let simmer for about 10 minutes longer. 
Settle by a dash of cold water or let stand a few minutes. 
A hot meal is now ready. Time about 40 minutes.

Chocolate and cocoa.— About 1 ounce per man per meal. If available, milk 
should be used in the place of water, and should be kept somewhat below the boil- 
ing point. Mix a 1-pound can of evai)orated milk with 3^ quarts of water to make 
1 gallon of milk of the proper strength for use in making cocoa or chocolate

132 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

307. MEATS. 

Bacon. — Cut the side of a bacon in half lengthwise. Then cut 
slices about five to the inch, three of which should generally be 
sufficient for one man for one meal. Place in a mess pan with about 
one-half inch of cold water. Let come to a boil and then pour 
water off. Fry over a brisk fire, turning the bacon once and q[uickly 
browning it. Remove the bacon to lid of mess pan, leaving the 
grease for frying potatoes, onions, rice, flapjacks, etc. 

Fresh, meat, fried. — Put one or two spoonfuls of grease in mess pan 
and let come to a smoking temperature, then drop in the steak 
and, if about one-half inch thick, let fry for about one minute before 
tiu-ning, the time depending upon wdiether it shall be rare, medium, 
or -well done. Then turn and fry briskly as before. Salt and pepper 
to taste. 

Applies to beef, veal, pork, mutton, venison, etc. 

Fresh meat, stewed. — Cut into pieces of from one-half to one-inch 
cubes. Fill cup about one-third full of meat and cover with about 
1 inch of water. Add such fibrous vegetables as carrots, turnips, or 
cabbage, cut into small pieces, and let boil or simmer about an hour. 
Potatoes, onions, or other tender vegetables are added when the 
meat is about half done. Amount of vegetables to be added is 
about the same as meat, depending upon supply and taste. Salt 
and pepper to taste. This applies to all fresh meat and fowls. 

Fresh fish may be handled as above, except that it requires less 
time to cook. Potatoes, onions, and canned corn are the vegetables 
generally used with it, thus making a chowder. A slice of bacon 
improves the flavor. 

Stews may be conveniently cooked in mess pan or tin cup. 

Fresh meat, broiled. — Cut slices about 1 inch thick, from half as 
large as the hand to four times that size. Sharpen a stick or branch 
about 2 to 4 feet in length and weave the point of the stick through 
the steak several times so that it may be readily turned over a few 
brisk coals or a small fire . Allow to brown nicely, turning frequently. 
Salt and pepper to taste. Meat with considerable fat is preferred, 
though any meat may be broiled in this manner. 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 133 

308. FRESH VEGETABLES. 

Potatoes, fried. — Take two medium-sized potatoes or one large one 
(about one-half pound), peel and cut into slices about one-fourth 
inch thick and scatter well in the mess pan in which the grease 
remains after frying the bacon. Add sufficient water to half cover 
the potatoes, cover with the lid to keep the moisture in, and boil 
from fifteen to twenty minutes. Remove the cover and dry as 
desired. Salt and pepper to taste. 

Potatoes, boiled. — Peel two medium-sized potatoes or one large 
one (about one-half pound), and cut into cubes of about IJ inches. 
Place in mess pan about three-fourths full of water, cover with lid, 
and let boil or simmer for 15 or 20 minutes. They are done when 
easily penetrated with a sharp stick. Pour off the water and allow 
to dry for one or two minutes over hot ashes or light coals. 

Potatoes, baked. — Take two medium-sized potatoes or one large 
one cut in half (about one-half pound). Lay in a bed of light coals, 
cover with same, and smother with ashes. Do not disturb for 30 or 40 
minutes, when they should be done. 

Onions, fried. — Same as potatoes fried. 

Canned tomatoes, stewed. — Pour into the mess pan one man's 
allowance of tomatoes (about one-fifth of a 2-pound can), add about 
two large hardtacks broken into small pieces, and let come to a boil. 
Add salt and pepper to taste, or a pinch of salt and one-fourth spoon- 
ful of sugar. 

Or, having fried the bacon, pour the tomatoes into the mess pan, 
the grease remaining, and add, if desired, two broken hardtacks. 
Set over a brisk fire and let come to a boil. 

Or, heat the tomatoes just as they come from the can, adding two 
pinches of salt and one-half spoonful of sugar if desired. 

Or, in hot weather, eaten cold with hard bread they are especially 
palatable. 

309. Hot breads — Flapjack. — Take six spoonfuls of flour and one- 
third spoonful of baking powder and mix thoroughly (or dry mix in 
a large pan before issue, at the rate of 25 pounds of flour and three 
half-pound cans of baking powder for 100 men). Add sufficient cold 
water to make a batter that will drip freely from the spoon, adding 
a pinch of salt. Pour into the mess pan, which should contain the 



134 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

grease from fried bacon, or a spoonful of butter or fat, and place over 
coals sufficiently hot to bake in from five to seven minutes. The 
flapjack may then be turned by a quick toss of the pan. Fry from 
five to seven minutes longer or until, by examination, it is foimd 
to be done. 

Hoecake. — It is made exactly the same as a flapjack by substitut- 
ing corn meal for flour. 

EMERGENCY RATION. 

310. Detailed instructions as to the manner of preparing the emer- 
gency ration are found with each can. Even a very limited amount 
of bacon or hard bread, or both, added to the emergency ration makes 
it far more palatable, and extends the period during which it can 
be consumed with relish. For this reason it is a good plan to hus- 
band the supply of hard bread and bacon and use it with the emer- 
gency ration when it becomes evident that the latter must be 
consumed. 

FIELD EXPEDIENTS. 

311. Equipment A is used when transportation is limited. With 
this equipment only boiling and frying can be done unless improvised 
ovens are constructed. In the absence of the fire irons provided 
with the equipment, narrow trenches of suitable width or trunks of 
green trees or rocks may be arranged as convenient substitutes. 
When time is available an oven in a bank or a mud field range should 
be constructed. These should be pro\'ided with openings on top, 
over which boilers may be placed for cooking. With this type of oven 
the cooking may be done on the top and afterwards the coals with- 
drawn and baking done in the chamber, or they may be used for 
baking and roasting only and the boiling otherwise provided for. 
By the latter method all portions of the meal may be cooked at one 
time. Another device which may be used is a simple range which' 
is made by covering a suitable trench with a bake pan or two for a 
boiling surface and utilizing two or more coffee cans set end on for a 
flue. Beans may be baked in dugout ovens, clay ovens, or a ver- 
tical hole dug in the ground into which a jar or camp kettle contain- 
ing them is placed and packed over and around with hot coals and 
earth. (See Par. 468.) Water may be kept cool without ice by 
using a canvas bag, or a can wrapped with wet burlap or grain sacks. 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 



135 



They should be kept in a draft, if possible, so as to increase the 
evaporation 

312. The following are some of the simple expedients that may be 
used in the field. 

An ice box is often a great convenience and may be constructed 
by simply setting a dry-goods box inside of a larger one, preparing 



IMPROVISED ICE BOX. 




To provide a simple ice box for the field, sink a packing box of suitable size into 
the ground and prepare a close-fitting cover in two parts, for convenience in handling. 
It is well to surround the box with heavy paper or with packed straw or grass to 
prevent dirt from falling in through the cracks. To provide drainage, bore several 
holes in the bottom of the box, and, if practicable, put a quantity of stone or gravel 
in the bottom of the pit before installing the box. If facilities are at hand, provide

8 inches — with sawdust, gunny sacks, leaves, grass, hay, straw, 
etc. Or even better, a single box may be set in the ^ound and 
packed around with materials as noted above or with solid earth. 

Improvised incinerators are essential in camp. They may be 
made in several forms, the simplest of which is a pit about 6 feet in 
diameter and about 3 feet deep in the center, sloping uniformly to

the outer edge. This pit is filled with rock, on which the fire is 
built. The water is poured into the edge of the pit and seeps among 
the hot rocks, which cause it to evaporate. The solid matter and 
cans are tlirown into the fire; the cans are raked out each morning. 
Although this is the most simple form of incinerator and the most 
easily constructed, it is the most expensive, because of the excessive 
amount of wood consumed. 



PIT FOR SLOPS. 



fP=Tl 




Whenever facilities are not provided for disposing of the kitchen waste, it becomes 
necessary to dig a pit. In short camps not likely to be used again all kitchen waste 
may be thrown into the pit, but in camps of longer duration it is necessary to stram 
all dish water, etc., through a box sieve suitably placed over the pit and then to 
bum all solid matter in the range or incinerator. To darken the pit and keep it free 
from flies, make a solid board top, tamp with dirt, and provide a detachable box 
sieve with cover, as shown. The pit should generally be about 2^ feet wide, 5 feet 
long, and 4 feet deep when dug in clay. In more permeal^le soil the dimensions may 
be somewhat reduced. The incinerator is more satisfactory for disposing of waste 
water. 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 



139 



The incinerator shown in paragrapli 296 in combination wdth the 
Army field range No. 1 is the most convenient and economical for 
camps of a few days. 

The following simple iiicinerator is recommended for a company 
in camps of longer duration. 



COMPANY INCINERATOR. 




Dig two trenches 10 feot long and 10 or 12 inches wide, bisecting each other. At 
the point of bisection have the trenches 30 inches deep, gradually shallowing from 
this point to the ends. Fill with rock until about 18 inches deep at ceiuer. Over 
the place of bisection place four boards to support an ordianry sugar or flour barrel. 
.Ground the l)arrel pile sods of earth up to the top. Pack tightly. Make a fire in 
the trench under the barrel, which, upon being burned out, leaves a hard cone. 
According to the direction of the wind, leave one trench open and plug the other 
three openings near the cone with boards, turf, or loose soil. This gives a draft of 
air through the open trench and up through the cone, which acts as a flue. 

If the soil is full of clay, the cone is easily made. If not it can be done in the man- 
ner shown in the illustration by using sods. 

A.11 the garbage of a company kitchen in the field can be easily disposed of by this 
means. 

-Vt the end of each day the ashes and tin cans should be raked out of the fireplace 
and a fresh fire started in the morning. 

The fire is kept up by dropping fuel material down the cone, and garbage is fed 
to it in the same manner.

The plate below illustrates the several varieties of improvised 
field ovens. 




1. Clay covered trench. 2. Open trench for baking. 3. Bean pit. 4. Ovens in 
hillside.' 5. Mud oven. 6. Mud range. 

HOW TO CONSTRUCT AND OPERATE A TWO-BARREL CLAY OVEN. 

Select a piece of level ground about 4 feet by 10 feet; get two 
salt or sugar barrels; knock top and bottom from one, and a small 
section of the bottom from the other (to be used as a flue in burning 
out); place them together head on, the one with the bottom to the 
rear. Cover the ends coming together with a little hay, so as to 
keep the sand from falling in, atid stuff up the hole broken in the 
bottom of the rear barrel. Get some moist sand and cover both 
barrels completely, molding it so that it will be about two inches 
thick on top and splay out at the bottom about 2 inches on each 
side. Then mix some clay with hay, straw, or grass until you have 
a pretty stiff mixture, and cover the sand, beginning at the bottom

where it should be about 8 inches thick and jfinishing at the top 
with about 4 inches. Let stand for a day or two and then add 
about 3 inches of clay to the entire oven. Allow to stand a day 
longer and then cut a hole at the rear, taking the hay from the bottom

of the barrel. This will afford a draught and is also an excellent 
means of regulating the heat. Put a fire in the barrels and bum

from the top and sides and throw it out. The oven is now complete. 
To obtain the best rasults with this type of oven, it is best to start 
the fire as soon as the dough is set. Keep up a pretty brisk fire for 
about two hours, and as soon as the dough is punched down, spread 
the coals evenly throughout the entire oven, and close all draughts. 
As soon as the dough is panned, draw the fire and close the oven up 
for about half an hour. Then take the oven "counts. " If you can

This oven will hold five pans, each 12 by 24 inches, or 50 rations — 
sufficient for a company — and is equal to baking properties to any 
oven made. 

To make a second run, put in another fire for about half an hour, 
draw the fire and close the oven for 15 minutes, and the oven will 
be ready for the second run. It would be well to dig a trench in 
front of the oven for convenience in handling the bread.

and top about eight inches.

some of the clay around them to hold them in place while finishing 
the top. 

If desired, a hole may be left at the back, and a mud chimney con- 
structed. This improves the draft and is believed desirable, but is 
not necessary. 

This oven should be allowed to stand in a dry atmosphere for at 
least 24 hours. Then burn out the barrels with a slow fire. Keep a 
slow fire burning until the oven is well dried. The sand will then 
drop out and can be raked out with a hoe. Remove the bricks or 
blocks and the range is ready for use, but cracks appearing should be 
plastered up with mud. Time required for four men to build, about 
4 hours. 

When articles cooked on top of the range are done, the fire can be 
drawn and the oven used for baking bread or meats. See figure 6 
above. 

This is recommended as a very good and convenient oven. A 
bank from 4 to 6 feet high is the best for the purpose. The roof cover- 
ing need not exceed 1^ feet. Two men with a spade and a long- 
handled shovel can build it in li^ht soil in three-quarters of an hour. 
If feuch tools are not available, it may be constructed with trowel, 
bayonet, intrenching tools, or even with knives. To build the oven, 
dig down the bank to a vertical face and excavate at the base a hole 
from 4 to 5 feet horizontally, care being taken to keep the entrance 
as small as possible; hollow out the sides of the excavation and arch 
the roof until the floor is about 2 feet 6 inches in its widest part and 
the roof 16 inches high in the center of the arch. Then Up the back 
end for the flue. A hole from 4 to 6 inches in diameter will furnish 
a good draft. A piece of tent stove pipe may be utilized for this 
purpose. When difficult of construction, the flue may be omitted, 
and practically as good results will be obtained. The time required 
for drying will depend upon the character of the soil. If ordinarily 
dry, a fire kept up for an hour will suffice. 

After the oven has been heated the temperature may be regulated 
by means of the door and flue — opening or closing them as may be 
necessary.

MESSING ON BAILBOAD TRAINS AND TRANSPOETS. 

ON RAILROAD TRAINS. 

313. Standard kitchen car. — This is a remodeled tourist sleeper, 
designed to cook for a battalion (peace strength) and to carry 42 men. 
Only limited faciUtiea are provided for cold storage and for the 
storage of nonperishable articles, so that the bulk of the food supplies 
must be carried in a baggage car. For this reason, arrangements 
should always be made to have a portion of a baggage car — from 
one-third to one-half — allotted for this purpose, and in making up 
the train this portion of the baggage car should be placed next 
to the kitchen. The garrison ration is issued, and a considerable 
saving should be made from the credit allowance on beef, beans, 
dried fruits, sugar, sirup, flavoring extracts, etc. With this sav- 
ing canned meats, canned vegetables, and canned fruits may be 
purchased. 

An officer is detailed by the commanding officer of the troops to 
take charge of the messing arrangements and he is assisted by a mess 
sergeant. The mess officer designates the hours for m.eals and the 
manner in which they are to be served and request-s the necessary 
details for kitchen police and waiters. Generally one or two cooks 
are provided by the Pullman Co. and the company cooks should 
be detailed to render them the necessary assistance and to per- 
form the duties of kitchen police. 

For serving the meal, the company mess sergeant and one man for 
each article on the bill of fare should report from each company. 
The serving of the meal does not begin until everything is ready. 
The details are then called up in order and the quantities due each 
organization having been determined, the troops farthest from the 
kitchen are served first. 

314. The following bills of fare are considered appropriate:

315. Suggestions to mess sergeant — 

(1) Keep the keys to the ice box during jouraev. 

(2) Weigh out to cooks every article on this bill of fare in the 
exact amount specified. 

(3) If it becomes apparent that rations will have to be turned in 
at end of journey, change meals so as to have nonperishable articles 
left as far as possible. 

(4) If no scales are available, refer to table of weights and meas- 
ures in individual cooking, Chapter VI, paragraphs 301 and 302. 

(5) Have sufficient water heated for the men to wash their dishes. 
Each car will send one man to the kitchen for same and dishes will 
be washed on car platform. Clean the platform when dishes are 
finished. 



MANUAL FOB ARMY COOKS. 151 

6) Use 30 pounds of bread to each meal. 

7) Use 3^ pounds coffee, 4 pounds sugar, 4 cans milk to each 
meal of coffee. 

316. Baggage car with field range. — When the standard kitchen 
car is not available, one or more Army field ranges may be set up 
in a baggage car. With this equipment the messing arrangements 
are similar to those when the standard kitchen cars are used. 

The following instructions are given for installing and dismantling 
field range No. 1 and boiling plate in a baggage car. 

Construct a box 6 feet 8 inches long by 3^ feet wide and about 
12 inches deep, inside measurements, using I^ or 2 inch material if 
available. Line the sides, ends, and top edge of box with gal- 
vanized iron or zinc. Place box in car running lengthwise on one 
side of the car, about 2 feet from the side. Fill box with dirt up to 
about 2 inches of the top. Place a brick flush with top of dirt at 
each of the four corners where the range will set. Place range in 
box, front and oven end close up against end of box, and deep 
k enough in box so that when oven door is opened it will lie flat on 
edge of box. Place boiling plate in box, the end resting on top of 
angle iron on rear of range. Place a brick under each front corner 
of boiling plate, flush ^vith top of dirt. The Alamo attachment is 
not used when range No. 1 is installed in the above manner. 
, Fasten range and boiling plate firmly to box by means of strap 
iron or two or three strands of telegraph or telephone wire, at points 
shown on figure. Fill space between range, boiling plate, and side 
of box with soft mud, to prevent heat from escaping. Three and 
even four field ranges may be installed in a car. 

Remove one of the top ventilating windows from car; tack tent 
guards, furnished with each range, over the opening — one on the 
outside of the car and one on the inside. Carry stovepipe up and 
out through the opening. End of pipe should extend about 6 inches 
outsiae of the ventilator opening. Elbow should be placed on end 
of pipe facing up and wired firmly to car. Wire stovepipe firmly to 
both sides of car. 

Box can be held firmly in position on floor of car hy nailing 2 by 
4 inch strips around sides and ends of box. This ib important and 
must not be neglected.

MANUAL FOE ARMY COOKS. 



153 



The following additional equipment to that supplied with each 
range is necessary: 

2 G. I. water cans. 
2 G. I. buckets. 
1 elbow, stovepipe. 
100 feet wire. 

Water cans should be filled on every'possible occasion where stops 
are made. 

If the equipment is to be set up in a freight car, a hole will have 
to be cut m the top of car for the stovepipe, using tent guards, as 
explained above, to cover the opening. 

317. Detachment kitchen car. — This car is designed for journeys 
where the number of men or the distance to be traveled does not 
warrant the use of the standard kitchen car. 

It is provided with a gas range attached to the Pintsch gas tanks, 
and cooks for as many men as can be carried on the car. There is 
no ice box or refrigerator on this car, and consequently fresh beef can 
not generally be carried for more than two meals, unless the weather 
is such that the meat may be carried in sacking on the platform. 
Travel rations and fresh bread for 30 men for five days can be carried, 
in the locker and a vacant section in the car. If the detachment is 
without an experienced cook, travel rations should be carried, and 
coffee made, under the direction of the oflBcer or noncommissioned 
oflBcer in charge. On short journeys, where an experienced cook is 
^available, the garrison ration should be provided.

318. Pintsch gas cooker. — This cooker is designed for the use of 
troops traveling in any type of car equipped with the Pintsch gas- 
lighting system, and practical experience haa shown that sufficient 
gas is generally available for all cooking to be done. It waa suffi- 
cient capacity for cooking for 48 men (the maximum number carried 
in one car) and supplies two hot components of the meal, as, for 
example, hot coffee and stewed corn, although but one article can 
be cooked at a time. One cooker is supplied with each car and 
contains ample utensils for cooking and serving the food, though 
the individual mess Id ta must be used. 

Directions for use. — In setting up the gas cooker the work should 
be supervised by a commissioned officer. If none are present, then 
by the noncommissioned officer in charge. 

(a) Set burner and stand in men's wash room or other suitable 
place and connect same with the nearest 4- tipped burner, as follows: 

(6) Remove glass bowl and turn over to porter. Unscrew 
4-cluster flame, being careful not to unscrew tne cluster stem. 
Screw ehort pieces of eaa tubing to cluster stem where 4-cluster 
flame was removed by the coupling at one end of the tubing. Then 
attach long piece of tubing to short piece and connect with the 
burner of the cooker. After the meal has been prepared disconnect 
long piece of tubing and allow end to remain attached to the cluster 
stem. When it is desired to operate the cooker, connect long piece 
of tubing to short piece. 

If it is not practicable to make connections with a 4-clu8ter flame 
connect burner of cooker with a 1 burner bracket lamp, as follows: 

WUh pliers remove gas tip and loosen the governing screw so as 
to insure a free flow of gas. 

If the governing screw sticks tap lightly with the handle of the 
screw driver until it can be easily removed. Do not entirely un- 
screw the governing screw. Slip rubber end of tubing over pillar 
and connect other end to the burner of the cooker. 

(c) The connections having been made, turn on the gas at the 
lamp and burner of the cooker and light with a wax taper. The 
greatest heat is obtained bv having a strong blue flame. 

(d) The burner being lighted, set on the largest copper boiler if it 
is desired to make coffee. The boiler should be fllled about two- 



MANUAL FOB ARMY COOKS. 15a. 

thirds full, additional water being added when the coffee has come 
to a boil. 

After coffee has been made, remove and set boiler on one of the^ 
asbestos mats, to prevent damage to the floor of the car. The second 
boiler is then set on the burner, with such food as may be desired 
to cook. Water must be added to prevent burning of food and 
melting the boilers. Stirring is also necessary when preparing 
certain foods. 

It requires about 1 hour and 20 minutes to prepare coffee and cook 
one hot dish for 48 men. 

After the meal is prepared set the galvanized-iron boiler on the 
burner and heat the necessary water for washing the mess kits and 
utensils. 

Caution — 

(a) Do not put boilers on without water in them. 

(b) Always add a little water, about 1 quart to every 10 pounds 
of food to prevent "burning. 

(c) Remove the coffee and hot water from the copper vessels as 
soon as practicable, to preserve the tinning inside. 

(d) Look at the gas name occasionally, to see that it has not blown 
out. 

(e) To reduce gas consumption and save time, get hot water for 
washing dishes from the locomotive. 

(/) Never light the ^as with boiler set on heater. 

ig) If the roadbed is rough and there is considerable motion to- 
the train, secure the stand and burner by the two leather straps 
furnished with the cooker. To prevent the splashing of water when 
coffee is made or water heated, place round slop board in the boQer& 
so as to counteract the motion of the car. 

(h) In case of leaks in the gas tubing, cut out leak with sharp 
knife and connect the two pieces of tubing with a coupler, wrapping 
ends of tubing with wire. 

(i) Handle the equipment intelligently and carefully. Never 
pack any article unless clean and dry. When returned to a depot- 
or post the equipment should be completely overhauled, cleaned,; 
and tested.

The subsisting of the troops is in charge of the chief steward, who 
is responsible for the discipline, good conduct, and efficiency of the 
employees of his department, and for the care and preservation of 
subsistence stores, cleanliness of troop galleys, and prevention of 
waste, and is required to see that the quantity and quality of provi- 
sions are satisfactory. But the messing of troops on board is under 



158 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

the immediate charge of a mess officer detailed by the commanding 
officer of the troops. 

The mess officer is assisted by a noncommissioned officer and by 
such other enlisted men (noncommissioned officers, cooks, bakers, 
waiters, etc.), detailed from the troops on board, as may be necessary. 
He is required to see that the meals are served in the proper order and 
at the proper time; that utensils are cleaned and put away after each 
meal; and that the mess decks are properly policed. He prescribes^ 
the order in which the di-fferent companies are to be served and 
prevents crowding and confusion in the troop galleys. He is respon- 
sible for the table furniture used and receipts to the quartermaster 
agent for it. Under the direction of the commanding officer, he 
should see that the casuals on board are divided into suitable sized 
mess squads and that all troops are assigned to certain tables and that 
when all can not be served at the same time, the sittings and assign- 
ments are such that no organization is placed at a disadvantage. He 
makes an inspection of the decks at each meal and sees that his orders 
are being carried out. 

It is his most important duty to see that the troops on board get the 
full benefit of their ration allowances. To do this, he should get from 
the adjutant a statement of the number of men to be subsisted in the 
troop mess and from the chief steward each day a list of the stores 
turned over to the troop galley, the bill of fare, and a price list of all 
stores on hand. The mess officer's assistant should check the list of 
stores actually turned over to the troop galley and the amount of 
bread actually issued. The mess officer has now complete data to 
enable him to determine just what subsistence stores may be pur- 
chased for the mess. He should keep a balance sheet, in order to 
know from day to day how the value of the food consumed compares 
with the daily allowance. In making this calculation it should be 
remembered that each 100 pounds of flour baked should produce 
about 140 pounds of bread ; that the regular bakers are paid the same 
as other ship's employees; and that the enlisted men detailed to 
assist them are given no extra compensation. The amount of bread 
actually consumed should never exceed 1 pound per man daily, and 
with proper care it should not exceed 12 ounces. T'le consumption 
of the meat and fresh vegetable components is ordLiarily about the 
same as in garrison. 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 159 

From a consideration of the above facts, it would seem that the 
troops should get all the meat and vegetables they want, and that 
there should be no reason for having any kind of a stew more than 
once a day. The troops should, however, be provided every day 
with a good stock soup. 

There is always more waste aboard ship than in a company mess on 
shore,' but this waste may be greatly reduced by carefulsnpervision. 
There are often many casuals on board, and it is only by the most 
careful supervision that unnecessary waste by them can be prevented. 
It is important that bread be cut into small slices and that all food not 
taken on the men 's plates be returned to the galleys for future use and 
that the men be not allowed to take on their plates more than they 
are going to eat. By careful supervision an excellent mess may be 
maintained . 

There should be an officer present with each organization at each 
meal to see that the men appear at the tables properly dressed, with 
hands and faces washed, hair combed, and hats off; JLha.t they are 
served in an orderly manner; that undue waste is prevented; that 
they remain at the table no longer than their allottea time ; that the 
tables are cleaned off and in good condition for the next sitting; and 
that men , not authorized to be on his portion of the mess decks at meal 
times, keep off. Fifteen minutes before meals the mess decks should 
be cleared and no one (not on duty) allowed to enter until mess call 
sounds, and then only those men who are assigned to that particular 
sitting. 

Experience has shown that troops can be made to appear just as 
well at their meals on board ship as in their barracks, and that they 
can be taught to preserve the same order and cleanliness as when on 
shore. 

For a command of 1,000 men, the following details from the troops 
are usually made: 

(a) One noncommissioned officer in general charge. He keeps 
check on the rations received and superintends the work of the men 
in the galley during the preparartion of the meals and during their 
service. He calls up the details from the different mess squads 
(usually one noncommissioned officer and three privates to each 
squad) in their j^roper order, and sees that the different components 
of the meal are issued out in sufficient quantities, according to the 



160 MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 

number of men in the various squads. He receives complaints and, 
if unable to remedy the same, at once reports the facts to the mess 
officer. 

(6) One noncommissioned officer and two men to carve meat. 
This noncommissioned officer assists the noncommissioned officer 
in general charge in any way directed. 

(c) Two cooks for day duty. 

Id) Two cooks for night duty, roasting beef, etc. 

(e) Two bakers. 

{f\ One assistant butcher. 

(a) One man to attend to the coffee boiler. 

(h) Two men for general work, peeling potatoes, etc. 

Altogether, about 1 man for every 50 on board. Prisoners are 
usually available for bringing rations from the hold . Troops usually 
have little to do on board, and the mess officer should be given as 
many men as he desires to assist in the work. 

320. Steam cooking. — Generally speaking, food on transports is 
cooked by steam. There is an impression that the steam used in 
cooking comes in direct contact with the food and that there is a 
peculiar taste to steam-cooked food. This is a mistake. A steam 
lacket surrounds the bottom and sides of the vessel, being separated 
from it about an inch and a half and having no connection with the 
inside of the vessel. In some cooking pots this jacket extends only 
half way up the sides, while in others it extends to the top. There 
is absolutely no difference between boiling and stewing in the 
steam pot and by the ordinary method on the range. 

321. Preparation of meats. — Beef may bo roasted nicely in any 
steam pot of sufficient capacity, to which the steam is suppliei 
through an inch pipe with 60 pounds pressure. The beef should be 
cut in pieces weighing about 5 pounds' each and put into the pot, no 
part of the meat coming above the steam jacket. Begin to baste 
the beef after about half an hour. When it is about half done, take 
an iron hook (about 2 feet long, with a 2-inch hook and wire grip) 
and turn the pieces over one by one. 

This method of roasting has no equal for medium and well done 
roasts, but the range is better for rare roasts. The st^am pot is 
better than the range for cooking fat meats, pork, and mutton. 



MANUAL FOR ARMY COOKS. 161 

322. Bread and cake. — On account of the limited space, the 
"straight-dough" process of baking bread should be followed on 
transports. Allow the dough to rise twice and work it down; allow 
it to nse again, and mold into loaves. One-pound loaves are the best 
size to bake, as they may be baked in from 30 to 40 minutes. With 
the proper number of bakers, the work pertaining to baking bread 
ehould be finished by 1 a. m. Between this time and 5 or 6 a. m. 
the shop may be used for baking cakes and pies for the troops. After 
5 or 6 a. m. it is used by the pastry cooks. To do this work, a shift 
of three bakers (for 1,000 men) should come on duty at 12 midnight 
and leave at 6 a. m. 

The following recipe for cake has been handled on board transports 
with marked success: 

50 pounds sugar. 

25 pounds fat. 

400 eggs. 

1 bottle lemon extract. 

2 pounds salt. 
100 pounds flour. 

10 8-ounce cans baking powder. 
Beat the sugar, fat, eggs, lemon extract, and salt together for 
about 15 minutes^ then add the flour and baking powder, mixing 
well. Add sufficient water to make a stiff batter. Spread from 
1^ to 2 inches deep in bake pans, and allow to bake from 30 to 50 
minutes in a medium-hot oven. 

An excellent cake can be made by using the same recipe and 
adding raisins or currants, or by blending witn the dough 10 pouids 
of chocolate, or by blending with one-half the dou^h 2 pounds of 
chocolate. In the last case, place the light dough m the pan first 
and spread the dough contaimng the chocolate on top of this. The 
recipe may be further varied by adding other flavors or by making 
layer cakes. 

An excellent icing can be made of the whites of 20 ^s, a bottle 

of lemon extract, 10 lemons, 1 ounce of tartaric acid, and suflicient 

' powdered sugar to thicken it. Whip well and spread over the cakes. 

i These cakes are called plain cake, raisin cake, currant cake, 

f chocolate cake, marble cake, lemon cake, lemon layer cake, etc. 

The fat required to bake pies and cakes can be saved from the beef.

Generally speaking the diet on board ship is too heavy, con- 
sidering the amount of work done by the men. Too much meat is 
consumed, A great variety of light food should be supplied them. 
Boiled fresh fish with cream sauce can easily be handled three time^ 
a week. Men do not easily tire of fresh fish, boiled or fried, but 
always tire of canned salmon when served frequently.

Mix the flour, salt, and molaeses (or sugar), and add water to make 
a stiff batter. Just before cooking each portion of the batter add the 
baking powder and grease the pan, as explained in the preceding 
recipe. If desired, this batter may be set the evening before, with 
3 cakes of dried yeast, allowing it to stand about 12 hours in a tem- 
perature of 80° F. In this case, 3 ounces of baking powder may be 
added, if desired, but this is not necessary. Serve hot with sirup, 
butter, or both. 

327. Cakes, com (for 60 men).

tion, as explained for batter cakes. In no case should all of the 
baking powder be added at once. Serve hot with sirup, butter, 
or both. 

Hot cakes. — In many organizations attempts to serve cakes have 
been given up on account of the apparent necessity of serving them 
cold. To obviate this, place a hot bake pan on the shelf in the range 
and as fast as the cakes are fried pile them carefuUy in tiers of about 
one dozen each and they will keep hot for a long time. Cover with 
a clean dish towel, and use one beneath the pile of cakes.

or seven hours at 180° F. Absolute cleanliness of meats, water, 
and cooking vessels must be the rule. Too much cooking and too 
little are both to be avoided. Place hams in near boilmg water 
5 or 10 minutes, after which reduce the water to a tepid temperature 
by the introduction of cold water, then heat to 180*^ F. and keep at 
that temperature until the hams are cooked. This process requires 
about 20 minutes to the pound . Hams thus cooked are practically 
steamed, as the moisture m the flesh is converted into vapor and the 
steaming process is taking place in the meat all the time. Skim 
all the impurities from the water as they arise. Let the hams cool 
in the water in which they were cooked.

heat for the greater part of the night. The first thing in the morning 
more water should be put in (if necessary), covering the beans about 
1 inch. It the breakfast requires a hot nre, the oven door should be 
left partly open, so that the beans will only simmer. If the oven 
can not be thus regulated, the beana should be removed and placed 
on the range or mantel, where they will barelv simmer. It may be 
necessary to add more water several times in the course of the morn- 
ing (in order to keep the beans barely covered). By 10 o'clock in 
the morning there snould be sufficient juice in the kettle, so that 
bubbles will rise to the surface as the beans simmer; in one-half 
hoiu" the beans will be ready to serve and should be removed to a 
place where they will be kept warm. Serve hot with some kind of 
salad. 

Water added while cooking should be boiling hot. Especially in 
summer, the beans should not be soaked, as they may sour and have a 
bad flavor. Beans left over may be used in the preparation of bean 
salad or chili con carne.

and allow to simmer for at least four hours. After they have sim- 
mered about two houi's, add the bacon and season with salt and pep- 
per. If necessary to add water during the process of cooking, it 
should be boiling hot. Serve hot. 

466. Beans, lima (for 60 men). 

Ingredients used : 

i2 pounds lima beans. 

^ pound of floiu". 

1 pound bacon, diced.

simmer for three-fourths of an hour; add more water or beef stock (if 
necessary to barely cover the beans) ; thicken slightly with a flour 
batter, and allow to simmer for about 15 minutes. When done the 
liquid should be of the consistency of thick sirup. Beans left over 
may be used in making salads. 

468. Beans cooked in a trench. This is an excellent method when 
properly done. Prepare the beans in the same "manner as if they 
were to be baked in the Army range in garrison. Dig a trench about 
6 inches deeper and 6 inches wider than the camp kettles used, and 
long enough- to allow 6 inches between kettles and between kettles 
and ends of trench. Build a good fire in the trench and let it bum 
to coals. Take out two-thirds of the coals, permitting one-third to 
remain in the trench. Place the camp kettles with fids on in the 
trench, resting on the coals. Fill in the space between kettles and at 
the ends of the trench with coal and earth, placing hot coals next to 
the kettles. Fill in well and cover the kettles to a depth of about 8 
inches, about 3 inches of coal and 5 inches of earth, the latter being on 
top. If this is done about 7 o'clock in the evening, the beans should 
be cooked by 4 o'clock in the morning. The same cook who has 
placed the kettles in the trench and covered them should dig them 
out in the morning, as he will understand better how the lids are 
set and there will be less danger of getting dirt in the kettles. 

Sufficient beans should be oaked for breakfast and lunch. If on 
the march, the beans for lunch should be issued to the men to be car- 
ried in their individual mess kits.

them. Experiments have proven conclusively that, while con- 
siderable lajd or fat is retjuired to float them, a very small amount is 
actually consumed in fr>ang. In recent experiments with pure lard,

How to make sauerkraut. 
Ingredients used — for one gallon: 
7i pounds trimmed cabbage. 

4 ounces salt. 

Remove outer green leaves, and after slicing the cabbage fine 
with cutter, place in barrel and salt; then, with a large wooden 
masher, stamp until of a mushy consistency. More cabbage and 
salt may be added and the operation continued until the barrel is 
full. After the barrel is filled cover the kraut with a clean cloth 
and then with a board prepared to fit snugly inside of the barrel. 
The board will be placed on the cloth and a hundred-pound rock on 
the board while the cabbage is fermenting. Let stand in a tem- 
perature of about 70° F. for one month. If the kraut is made in 
warm weather, the amount of salt used must be increased to 6 ounces 



222 MANUAL FOB ARMY COOKS. 

per gallon, and the time it takes for it to ripen will be less than in 
colder weather. When the kraut is ready for use it will have a 
decided odor, but when not fully matured it will have an odor 
somewhat resembling that of beer. The temperature of the place 
where it is stored has much to do in influencing the acidity acquired 
in any given time. Each time when removing kraut from barrel, 
thoroughly wash both cloth and barrel cover, as well as weight and 
sides of barrel, before replacing. This should be attended to once 
each week whether kraut is removed or not. Care should be exer- 
cised in the selection of a barrel for sauerkraut. Charred barrels 
should not he used. Oak barrels are preferable.

SALADS AND DRESSINGS. 

518. Salads are eaeily prepared and, when well seasoned and 
served, meet with much favor. In addition to the ingredients, a. 
little forethought is necessary as the different components should be- 
prepared some time in advance. 



224 MANUAL FOR ABMY COOKS. 

Certain fundamental principles muflt be observed in their prepa- 
ration: 

1. Salads must be served cold. 

2. They should be highly seasoned. 

3. They should be attractively served. To accomplish this 
almost any bite of sightly, tender vegetables may be placed about 
the dish or on top or the salad. Si)rigs of parsley, lettuce, either 
whole or shreddea, celery, green onions, sliced unpeeled radishes, 
diamond or heart diaped beets, sliced pickles or lemons, shreddea 
cabbage, minced pickles shaken over the salad, are all used. 

Any vegetable may be used in salads, either alone or in combina- 
tion with otJier vegetables. Lettuce, radishes, and onions may be 
used in several combinations. Cabbage, shredded fine and soaked 
in cold water for two hours, makes a satisfactory salad. Stringless 
beans or peas that have been cooked and cooled mav be used alone 
or in combination with other vegetables. An excellent salad may 
be made of beets, either alone or preferably combined with other 
vegetables. The beets should be cooked, then diced and allowed to 
stand in vinegar for one hour. Potatoes are frequently used in salads, 
either alone or as a filler in meat, fish, or vegetable salads. 

When meat salads are served to troops a vegetable filler should be 
added to diminish the cost and improve the flavor. Thus, when 
chicken is provided, one-half boneless chicken and one-half diced 
celery or otner green vegetables should be used. Tiu-key, tongue, 
lean beef cut fine may be used. All meat must be well done before] 
using. Fat meat is undesirable as the dressing usually contains] 
olive or cottonseed oil in such quantity that other fats are unneces- 
sary. 

Almost any kind of edible fish may be used in salad, although 
lajge fish are to be preferred on account of being more easily boned. 
Fim should be cooked until done, the bones remo-ved, and the flesh 
mixed with one-third to one-half vegetables. 

Cold hard-boiled eggs, olives, onions, or pickles, minced or sliced 
when mixed in a salad, spread over it, or used as a garnish, add tc 
the appearance and flavor.

1 Where two or more quantities are given in the same column, correspondingly 
large or small amounts should be used together. The richness of the product depends 
upon the quantities of such ingredients used. 

Note.— The temperature of the sponge, of the dough, and of the buns while proving 
should be as near to 80' F. as possible. 

Let the dough rise to about three timeaits size, punch down work 
over and permit to rise to twice its original "size. Then work into 
1-pound loaves (round), weighing the dough on the scales, and let 
prove for about 15 or 20 minutes. Then, for small doughs, cut into 
eight equal parts. This can best be done by rolling the proof ball 
or loaf, cut into a long c^^linder, dividing it in halves with the scraper, 
aubdividing each half into halves, and then in a similar way sub- 
dividing again. The above recipe is sufficient for about 180 buna, 
Dr about 22 Jenny Linds. 

577. To handle a sponge in cold weather. — The temperature of the 
room, flour, and water should be such that the sponge, when com- 
pleted, will have a temperature of from 85° to 90 F. (See par. 77, 
Part II.) Place the sponge in a suitable vessel and the vessel in a 
fireless cooker. If one is not available, select another vessel about 
3 inches larger in diameter and 6 inches deeper; j)lace cloths or 
sacks in the bottom of the larger vessel to a depth of 2 inches. Then 
put the vessel containing the sponge into the larger vessel and close 
the top of the smaller, packing cloths or sacks over the inner and 
outer vessels. Close the top of the outer vessel and put it in a warm 
place in the kitchen. The sponge, thus protected, will be subltected 
to only a slight variation in temperature d uring the night. Dry hay, 
grass, or straw may be sued in lieu of cloths or sacks. This arrange- 
ment is similar in action to a fireless cooker and is especially recom- 
mended for camp.
