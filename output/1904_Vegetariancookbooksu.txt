PREFACE 



The enthusiasm with which the first edition of **The 
Vegetarian Cook Book'* was received by the public, and 
the increasing demand for a more extended work on the 
same 'subject, have led to a careful revision of the book. 
This edition, like the former, is placed upon the market 
with the intention of supplying a need not met by the 
ordinary cook book. 

It is a recognized fact that the foundation for many 
of the ills of the human race is laid at the table through 
the eating of unwholesome food. Believing that preven- 
tion is better than cure, special attention has been given 
to the preparation of healthful as well as palatable dishes. 
True to this plan, and as suggested by the name of the 
book, all meat recipes have been omitted, the superiority 
of other foods being recognized. Nor are the advantages 
of a vegetarian diet any longer a matter of experiment. 
The prevalence of disease among animals is leading thou- 
sands of thinking men and women to discard flesh foods, 
and to turn to the more natural diet of nuts, grains, 
fruits, and vegetables. Special attention has been given 
in this book to the preparation of foods that will consti- 
tute appetizing and nutritious substitutes for meat dishes. 
An effort has also been made in all recipes to avoid such 
combinations of food elements as interfere with the proc- 
esses of digestion. In fact, wholesome food, palatable, in

abundant variety, and with economy in the cost of prep- 
aration, may be said to be the message of the book. 

In revising the original work, many new recipes have 
been added, as well as several entire chapters intended to 
make the book of greater value for family use, and also 
for restaurant and sanitarium work. Accuracy in detail 
has been followed throughout in the preparation of recipes ; 
and this second edition is submitted to the public with the 
firm belief that all who give the book a fair trial will find 
a "vegetarian diet both pleasing and healthful.

1 GOOD COOKING 




Good cooking is not the result of accident, a species of 
good luck, as it were. There is reason in every process ; a 
law governing every chemical change. A vcourse of med- 
ical lectures does not make a physician, nor will a collec- 
tion of choice recipes make a cook. There must be a knowl- 
edge of compounding, as well as of compiling; of baking, 
as well as of mixing; and above all, one must engage in 
the real doing. Theory alone will not suffice; but ex- 
perience, which practise only can give, is of the utmost 
importance. 

Mention will be made, under this head, of only those 
forms of cooking which enter into vegetarian cookery as 
usually understood. 

BOILING 

The term *' boiling,'' as applied to cookery, means cook- 
ing in a boiling liquid. Many kinds of food need the ac- 
tion of water or other liquid, combined with heat, to cook 
them in the best manner; and boiling is one of the most 
common forms of cookery. When water becomes too hot 
to bear the hand in it with comfort, it has reached one hun- 
dred and fifty degrees, or the scalding point. When there 
is a gentle tremor or undulation on the surface, one hun- 
dred and eighty degrees, or the simmering point, is reached. 
When there is quite a commotion on the surface of the 

(7)

water, and the bubbles breaking above it throw off steam 
or watery vapor, two hundred and twelve degrees, or the 
boiling point, is reached. After water reaches the boil- 
ing point, it becomes no hotter, no matter how violently 
it may boil. The excess of heat escapes in steam. This 
important fact is rarely understood by the average cook; 
and much fuel is often needlessly wasted because of the 
mistaken idea that rapidly boiling water cooks food more 
quickly. 

In all ordinary cooking, simmering is more effective 
than violent boiling. The temperature of the water may 
be slightly raised by covering the kettle. If sugar or salt, 
or anything to increase its density, is added to water, it 
takes longer for it to boil, but its boiling temperature is 
higher. This explains why boiling sirup and boiling salt 
water are hotter than boiling fresh water. Boiling effects 
partial destruction or removal of organic and mineral im- 
purities found in water; hence the importance of boiling 
the water where such impurities exist. Boiling also ex- 
pels all the air and the gases .which give fresh water its 
sparkle and vitality; therefore the sooner water is used 
after it begins to boil, the more satisfactory will be the 
cooking. 

Fresh water should be used when the object is to ex- 
tract the flavor, or soluble parts, as in soups and broths. 
Salt water should be used when it is desired to retain the 
flavor and soluble parts, as in most green vegetables. Cold 
water draws out the starch of vegetables. Boiling water 
bursts starch grains, and is absorbed by the swelling 
starch, and softens the cellulose in cereals and vegetables.

GOOD COOKING 



MILK 



In cooking some kinds of food, milk is used instead of 
water. Milk being thicker than water, less of the steam 
escapes, and it becomes hot sooner than water, adheres to 
the pan, and burns easily. At its boiling temperature 
(214 degrees), the casein contained in the milk is slightly 
hardened, and its fat rendered more difficult of digestion. 
By heating milk in a double boiler, these daagers are 
avoided. The process is a form of steaming. The milk 
then reaches a temperature of only 196 degrees, and is 
called scalding milk. 

STEAMING 

The process of cooking food over boiling water is 
termed steaming. It is a very satisfactory and convenient 
method, without much loss of substance. It takes a longer 
time than some other ways of cooking, but requires less 
attention. There are two methods of cooking by steam: 
(1) In a steamer, which is a covered pan with perforated 
bottom. The steamer is placed over boiling water, and the 
steam carries the heat directly to the food. (2) By means 
of a double boiler. By this method the heat is conveyed 
from the boiling water, through the inner boiler, to the 
food. When cooking by steam, the water should boil 
steadily until the food is done. Watery vegetables are 
made drier by steaming, and flour mixtures develop a dif- 
ferent flavor from that which they have when baked. 

STEWING 
This is cooking in a small quantity of water at a low 
temperature for a long time, and is a form of boiling.

10 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

The food loses less nutriment when stewed than when 
rapidly boiled. 

BAKING 

, Cooking by means of dry heat, as in a close oven, is 
known as baking. The closely confined heat of the oven 
develops flavors which are entirely different from those 
obtained by other forms of cooking. For many kinds of 
food the baking is as important as the mixing; and every 
cook should thoroughly understand how to regulate the 
oven. Nearly all flour mixtures, as bread, cakes, and 
many kinds of pudding, are more wholesome when baked 
than when cooked in any other way. 

BRAIZING 

This is a combination of stewing and baking. Meat 
cooked in a closely covered stew-pan, so that it retains its 
own flavor and the flavors of the vegetables and seasonings 
put with it, is braized. Dishes thus cooked are highly 
esteemed. 

BROILING 

Broiling, meaning *'to burn,'' is cooking directly over, 
or in front of, the clear fire, and is the hottest form of 
cooking. The intense heat, combined with the free action 
of the air, produces a fine flavor quite unlike that obtained 
in any other way. Pan broiling is broiling on a hot sur- 
face instead of over hot coals.

Cream soups are seasonable at any time, using any 
vegetable in its season. Canned goods may be used when 
the fresh article is not obtainable. 

Vegetables that are too tough and old to cook in any 
other way, may be used in soups. A teaspoonf ul of whipped 
cream dropped into eacli plate is very delicious. 

By a puree is meant a soup thicker than a cream soup. 
If properly made, cream soups and purees are dainty, de- 
licious, and nourishing. 

Fruit soups are in favor during hot weather, for 
dinners and luncheons; they are very easily made, and 
are wholesome and refreshing. Any desired fruit juice 
may be thickened with corn-starch, sago, or arrowroot, and 
served with or without fruit, hot, or cold with cracked ice. 

KINDS OF SOUP 

Observing these proportions and following the fore- 
going directions, delicious cream soups are made of rice, 
squash, celery, peas, asparagus, cucumbers, spinach, pea- 
nuts, potatoes, corn, Lima beans, cauliflower, beets, toma- 
toes, salsify, chestnuts, mushrooms, onions, baked beans, 
lentils, macaroni, spaghetti, watercress, string-beans, sago, 
tapioca, barley, carrots, etc. All vegetables should be 
cooked very tender in boiling water. Add salt a short 
time before removing; if added when the vegetables first 
start cooking, it tends to harden them, and they therefore

require longer cooking. They may be added to the soup 
with or without forcing through a colander. Eice and 
barley may be cooked in a stew-pan, but sago and tapioca 
should be cooked in a double boiler. If chestnuts are to 
be used, they should be boiled and mashed. Macaroni, 
spaghetti, and vermicelli should be broken the desired 
length before being put into the boiling water. String- 
beans should be minced before they are added to the soup. 

VEGETABLE STOCK 

Boil minced turnips, carrots, celery, and onions in 
enough water to make half the amount of stock required. 
When the vegetables are done, drain, and add an equal 
amount of rich bean broth, with a little brown flour, nut 
butter, celery salt, and just enough strained tomato to 
remove the sweet vegetable taste. This stock should be 
of the consistency of broth when done. Protose may be 
cooked with the vegetables if it can be afforded. The 
vegetables should be put to cook in cold water, that the 
substance and . flavor may be well drawn out. 

FOUNDATION OF CREAM SOUPS 

Rub one heaping tablespoon of butter and two of 
sifted flour to a cream; melt in a saucepan over the fire, 
and add slowly four cups of milk, stirring constantly. 
When it thickens, add salt, and whatever seasoning and 
ingredients are desired to make the soup.

VEGETABLES 71 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR VEGETABLES 

Fresh green vegetables should be cooked as soon as pos- 
sible after being gathered. Those containing sugar, as 
corn and peas, lose some of their sweetness by standing. 
Wash thoroughly in cold water, but unless wilted do not 
soak. It is better not to prepare fresh green vegetables 
until they are needed ; but if they must be prepared some 
time before cooking, cover with cold water. 

. Most vegetables should be put into fresh, rapidly boil- 
ing water, and if cooked in uncovered vessels, they will 
retain a better color, as high heat destroys their color. 
In no instance permit them to steep in the warm water, 
as this toughens them, and in some instances destroys both 
color and flavor. 

Salt hardens water, and also sets the color in vegetables. 
For peas and beans do not add salt to the water until they 
are nearly done, as they do not boil tender so readily in 
hard water. 

Corn should not be boiled in salt water, as the salt 
hardens the outer covering of the skin, and makes it tough. 
Cook the vegetables rapidly, till perfectly tender, but no 
longer. If vegetables are cooked too long, flavor, color, 
and appearance are all impaired. To judge when done, 
watch carefully, and test by piercing with a fork. The 
time required to cook a vegetable varies with its age and 
freshness ; therefore the time-tables given for cooking serve 
only as approximate guides. 

Delicate vegetables, as green peas, shelled beans, celery, 
etc., should be cooked in as little water as possible, toward 
the last the water being allowed to boil away till there is 
just enough left to moisten. In this manner all the de-

gum, and makes them less sticky. At other times, long 
soaking is undesirable. 

Soak about half an hour in the fall, one to three hours 
in winter and spring. Never serve potatoes, whether 
boiled or baked, in a closely covered dish, as they thus 
become sodden and clammy; but cover with a folded nap- 
kin, and allow the moisture to escape. They require about 
forty-five minutes to one hour to bake, if of a good size, 
and should be served promptly when done. 

BAKED POTATOES 

Potatoes are either baked in their jackets or peeled; 
in either case they should not be exposed to a fierce heat,

When the peas are older, half a cup of milk or cream, 
with sufficient flour to thicken, is considered an improve- 
ment. A teaspoonful of finely minced parsley cooked with 
peas imparts to them a very delicious flavor. 

SPLIT PEAS 

Beii)g free from the outside hull, split peas cook very 
quickly. Wash, and set to cook in hot water; boil care- 
fully, and watch closely that they do not stick ; season and 
serve. Split peas are usually used in soups and purees. 

PUREE OF PEAS 

Peas, fresh, 2 cups (or dry, 1 cup). 
Butter, 1 tablespoon. 
Cream or milk, li/^ cups. 
Flour, 1 level tablespoon. 
Salt, 1 teaspoon. 

Put the peas to cook in cold water; boil until tender, 
then simmer slowly, cooking as dry as possible without 
seorehing. When soft and dry, rub through a colander to 
remove the hulls. Put the butter in a saucepan; when 
melted, stir in the flour, being careful not to scorch ; pour 
in the milk gradually, stirring all the time ; and when thor- 
oughly cooked, add the salt and the pulp of the peas. Turn 
all into a double boiler, heat thoroughly, and serve. 

LENTILS, ORIENTAL STYLE 

Lentils, 1 cup.

BOILED GREEN CORN 

Strip off the husk, remove the silk, put into fresh boil- 
ing water, and cook ten to twenty minutes. Cook only till 
done; for if boiled too long, the corn hardens, and its 
flavor is impaired. If the com is not very sweet, add one 
fourth cup of sugar to the water in which it is boiled. 
The addition of a small amount of milk or lemon juice to 
the water in which the corn is boiled improves the color. 

NOVELTY BAKED CORN 

Strip the husks of the corn down so that all the silks 
can be removed. Cut out any imperfections. Wipe with 
a cloth, replace the husks, and wrap the ear with twine; 
place in a medium oven, and bake until tender. It may 
be found best to place a pan of water in the oven to add 
moisture. 

KORNLET 

Press com that has been cut from the cob, or canned 
corn, through a fine colander, or grind through a vegetable 
mill with a fine die; season and serve. 

STEWED TOMATOES 

Wash, peel, and quarter the tomatoes; allow to stand 
in a granite stew-pan for a few minutes for enough juice 
to run out in which to cook them; stew slowly for a few 
minutes. Season and serve.

HOLLAND BOILED TURNIPS 

Turnips, cut in %-inch dice, 1 quart. 
Egg, 1. 

Butter, y^ cup. 
Lemon, large, 1. 

Boil the turnips till tender in just enough salted water 
to prevent burning; drain, and set in a covered dish on 
the side of the range, where they will keep hot but not 
burn. Melt the butter, add the beaten yolk of the egg, 
the juice of the lemon, dnd a little salt. Serve a spoon- 
ful of this sauce over each order of turnip. 

ASPARAGUS NO. 1 

Asparagus, like potatoes, contains a bitter alkaloid, 
which is drawn into the water in cooking, and often im- 
parts to it a very unpleasant flavor. This may be reme- 
died by parboiling the asparagus for four or five minutes. 
Then drain, add more hot water, and finish cooking. 

ASPARAGUS NO. 2 

Scrape the stalk ends of the asparagus, or break off 
the tough lower stalks as far as they will snap. Wash well, 
tie in bundles, and put into enough rapidly boiling salted 
water to cover. Allow a teaspoonful of salt to each quart 
of water. Cook uncovered from twenty to thirty minutes, 
or till perfectly tender. Drain, remove the string, spread 
with salt and butter, and serve immediately on toast. The 
asparagus may be neatly arranged on hot toast and cov- 
ered with white cream sauce, if preferred.

vegetables, any combination pleasing alike to the eye and 
the palate being permissible, and if care is taken in the 
arrangement, it may be made a very attractive dish. 

To the dressing of salads one must give utmost care 
and attention, as upon its excellence the success of the 
dishes principally depends. While rules for dressings are 
innumerable, there are, after all, only a few really good 
ones. The French dressing and the mayonnaise are most 
generally known, the former being the simplest and most 
.commonly used of all dressings. And it is quite the fa- 
vorite for lettuce, cresses, chicory, and other vegetable 
salads. As the salad wilts if allowed to stand in the dress- 
ing, it should not be added till just at the moment of serv- 
ing, and it is for this reason that it is frequently made at 
the table. 

One of the most difficult things to prepare is a per- 
fect mayonnaise; but once the knack is acquired, failure 
afterwards is rare. One essential point is to have all the 
materials cold. Chill in the refrigerator both the bowl and 
oil an hour or more before using. In warm weather it is ad- 
visable during the mixing to set the bowl in a larger one of 
cracked ice. This dressing, if covered closely, will keep 
several days or longer in the ice-box. Keep in a cold place 
till wanted, as it liquefies as soon as mixed with other in- 
gredients. To tone down the taste of the oil, and thus make 
more delicate salads, one may add to the dressing, just 
before it is used, a little cream beaten stiff and dry. This 
dressing is used with nut and fruit salads, and may be 
used with potatoes, tomatoes, celery, and other vegetables. 

Most cooked vegetables intended for salads are moistened 
with a French dressing and allowed to stand an hour or

Better results follow when the tapioca is soaked over- 
night or for several hours. Wash the tapioca, and soak 
in the water ; just before cooking add sugar and pineapple 
juice. Cook in a double boiler until transparent, and pour 
into a flat pan to cool. If sliced pineapple is at hand, 
dice it, and place in the bottom of the pan, before pouring 
in the tapioca. 

If, when cooking tapioca or sago for pudding, it should 
cook too long and get thin, it may be .made into a good 
dessert by beating it into beaten egg whites; season, and 
mold in cups or pan. Serve with a colored sauce. 

ORANGE SAGO MOLD 

Sago, 1/^ cup. 
Sugar, 1/2 cup. 
Orange juice, 1 cup.

Tapioca, i^ cup. 
Sugar, 1 cup. 
Salt, ^ teaspoon. 
Milk, 1 quart. 
Eggs, 4. 
Flavor to suit. 

Wash the tapioca, and put to cook with the milk in a 
double boiler ; stir occasionally, and cook till clear. Beat 
the eggs till light, beat in the sugar, and add to the tapioca. 
Let cook a minute, and remove from the range. Stir in 
the flavoring, turn into a pan of suitable size, and brown 
in oven. Serve cold. If desired, the whites of two of 
the eggs may be used as a meringue, which should be 
flavored the same as the custard.

of pineapples. Milk may be substituted for water, and 
two eggs used if desired. 

The tapioca may also be flavored and colored.

Stir till it is thick and there are no lumps. Flavor with 
lemon, take from the range, and add the stiffly beaten 
whites. Pour into molds, and set in a cool place to get 
firm. 

A pleasing eflEect may be obtained by dividing the mix- 
ture after it is, cooked, and coloring one half pink, then 
filling each mold one third full of one, and filling up with 
the other. When turned from the mold, they will look like 
small, white pyramids capped with pink, or pink with 
white. 

A custard to be served with this blanc-mange is, made 
with two cups of milk, the yolks of three eggs, and half 
of a cup of sugar. Flavor the same as blanc-mange. 

APPLE WALNUT PUDDING 

Apples, large, 4. 

Sugar, l^ cup. 

Nutmeg. 

Walnut^, chopped, l^ cup. 

Cake batter. 

Water, 2 cups. 

Peel the apples, cut into half -inch cubes, sprinkle with 
nutmeg and sugar, cover with water, and cook under cover, 
in a slow oven, until tender. Add the nut meats, and 
over all pour cake batter to a depth of one fourth inch. 
Bake, and serve with cream. 

The proportions given for plain sponge cake are 
enough for three such puddings. As it is difficult to make 
a small amount of cake batter, the full recipe could be 
made, and that remaining could be baked as a cake.

PIE CRUST 

Pastry flour, 1 pint. 

Butter, 3 rounding tablespoons; or oil, 14 cup. 

Salt, 1 teaspoon. 

Cold water, 8 tablespoons. 

Rub the butter or the* oil, and the salt, into the flour ; 
add the water, stirring carefully with a fork. Lay a suf- 
ficient portion of this on a floured board, and roll out. 
Work the pie paste as little as possible. For tender pie 
crust, use spring wheat flour, as the gluten in the winter 
wheat flour makes it tough. This recipe will make paste 
enough for two double-crust pies. 

PIE SHELLS 

Cover a pie tin with good pie paste, press this into 
shape by setting another tin of the same size into it, trim, 
and bake between the tins. This keeps the crust in shape. 
Use the shells for lemon, prune, and other pies that do not 
require baking after the filling has been added.

PLAIN SPONGE CAKE 

Eggs, 4. 

Sugar, 2-3 cup. 

Hot water, 2 tablespoons. 

Flour, 1 cup. 

Corn-starch, 1 tablespoon. 

Flavor. 

Break the eggs into a round-bottom basin or crock, 
beat for five to eight minutes with a Dover egg beater, add 
the sugar, and beat again; then add, while beating, the 
hot water and flavor. Now fold in the flour and starch, 
which have been mixed together. Bake in a slow oven. 

SIMPLE SPONGE CAKE 

Eggs, 6. 

Granulated sugar, sifted, 1 cup. 

Flour, 1 scant cup. 

To the unbeaten eggs add the sugar, and beat with a 
wire egg beater till the mixture is thick and light colored. 
Then add the flour, folding it in gently. Bake in a mod- 
erate oven. When done, invert the pan, letting it rest on 
two dishes till the cake is cool, when it can easily be taken 
out. Thus suspended from the bottom of the pan, the 
cake is stretched by its own weight, which makes it lighter 
and more elastic than if left to fall by its own weight in 
cooling. The quantity given will make a small loaf cake, 
or two layers.

Consequently, as a mixture heats in cooking, incorporated 
air expands, giving the desired lightness. Air is incor- 
porated or enclosed in batters by beating the mixture thor- 
oughly, as in making whole wheat gemsj by adding eggs 
to the beaten mixture, as in popovers; and by the gas ob- 
tained by the union of an acid with an alkaline carbonate, 
as in the use of baking powders. In batters made light by 
the admixture of air, one must exercise care in beating, in 
order actually to incorporate and retain the air. When eggs 
are added to the mixture, the glutinous consistency of the 
albumin they contain assists in retaining the entangled air. 

LIGHT BREAD 

In bread making it is necessary to have first-class yeast, 
the best of flour, pure water, a good oven, and any amount 
of good common sense. 

Variations must be made according to locality, climate, 
altitude, kind of flour, and other conditions. Experience 
is a necessary teacher in this as in any other work. The 
quickest and surest way to become proficient in the art 
is to place yx)urself under the tutorage of a good bread 
maker. 

To insure the best results, the temperature should be 
the same throughout the process; and this can only be 
determined by the use of a thermometer. Ten or fifteen 
cents will buy one which will record 120 degrees, which is 
sufficiently high, as the material should not be allowed to 
reach more than 85 degrees ordinarily. Some localities 
may require a higher temperature. 

An earthen bowl is better than tin or granite, as it is 
not so subject to change of temperature.

in this book). If rolls are desired, have the dough of 
double thickness, cut in strips, about half an inch square, 
and roll with the hands until round. These are usually 
served about three inches long. Beaten biscuits are made 
by rolling the dough out in a large roll about one and one 
half inches thick, and cutting transversely about one inch 
thick; round out the edges, and make a hole in the center 
by forcing the thumb and finger together while the dough 
is held between them.

Toasts are uniformly and properly regarded as a break- 
fast dish, and when properly prepared are wholesome, 
nutritious, and appetizing, and far more conducive to 
health than the fried mushes and griddle cakes with which 
so many are prone to appease their appetites. 

Zwieback should be used as the foundation of all toasts, 
although ordinary toasted bread can be used. In toasting 
bread, do not expose it to such fierce heat that the bread 
will be burned or singed. Singed bread is not toasted 
bread. It should be toasted as far through as possible, 
and should be crisp and brittle, not hard. In using zwie- 
back for toast, it may be moistened with hot milk if for 
cream, gravy, or egg toast ; or with hot waited water if for 
fruit. In either case, the toast should be dipped quickly 
in and out again, so as not to absorb too much liquid and 
become mushy. Under this head a few kinds of toast 
will be given, inexpensive and otherwise. While it is not 
an exhaustive list, it will include sufficient to suggest others 
equally good.

Salt. 

Water, milk, or cream, 4 tablespoons. 

Add the liquid and the salt to the eggs, beat lightly, 
and pour enough of this to make one omelet, into a hot, 
greased omelet pan ; cook on hot stove ; run knife or spatula 
under first one side, and then another, of the omelet, at 
the same time tilting the pan to the side where the knif6 
is inserted, thus allowing the uncooked portion to run 
underneath. Double one third part over, invert on hot 
plate, and serve. 

PROTOSE OMELET 

Protose, y^ a thin slice. 
Eggs, 2. 

Parsley, minced. 
Cooking oil. 

Mince the protose fine; beat the yolks of the eggs a 
little, and stir the minced protose into them. Beat the 
whites into a froth, not stiff, and stir into the protose; 
add a little minced parsley. Put a little oil into an omelet 
pan, and when hot pour in the mixture. Cook a few min- 
utes. Insert a knife between the omelet and the pan, and 
with a sudden turn of the hand fold the omelet in two. 
Cook in a hot oven two or three seconds. Serve hot.

As soon as well curded, it should be poured into a strong 
but loose cloth to drain without pressure. Overnight is 
none too long for it to remain quiescent. It may then have 
added to it a portion of salt, and as much sweet cream or 
milk or sour cream as will be required to make it of the 
desired consistency. Should there be any lack of smooth- 
ness, the cheese will be vastly improved by passing through 
a colander or an ordinary meat mill. 

Various seasonings may be added, as minced onion, 
parsley, or other herbs, and the whole formed into balls or 
other shapes. 

Served with a garnish of lettuce or other green, it gives 
a pleasing variety. Used in place of common cheese with 
macaroni, it is more wholesome than that article. 

Sweet milk may be readily curded by the addition of 
lemon juice. One cup stirred into a gallon of warm milk 
will usually gather all the curd. If the whey is white and 
milky, add a little more juice, and more curd will form.

hour, until they are a light brown or straw-color. Shake 
the pan or stir the peanuts every few minutes. When the 
kernels begin to crack and pop, they brown very quickly, 
and should be watched closely. 

. A satisfactory way to cook the nuts is to fill a tight 
covered dish about two thirds full, place in the oven, and 
shake occasionally. Cooked this way, they are not so liable 
to bum, and they retain their flavor better. When they 
have cooked sufficiently, spread them out at once. When 
they have become quite cool, blanch. This can be done 
by rubbing them in the hands, or what is better, in a 
coarse bag, or with a piece of cloth with the ends folded 
together, forming a bag. Another good device is a screen 
made of coarse wire. Rub them until the skins are loose. 
The chaff can be removed by using a fan, or by pouring 
from one dish to another where the wind is blowing. Look 
the nuts over carefully, removing defective ones and 
foreign substances. 

Grind when fresh cooked, as they do not make good 
butter whep left a day or two after they are cooked. 

PROCESS NO. 2 

Thoroughly heat the nuts in an oven, but do not let 
them brown. Allow them to cool, then blanch as described 
in process No. 1. Boil them from three to four hours, until 
they are tender. Drain, spread out on tins, and thoroughly 
dry them ; then grind them through a mill. 

ALMOND BUTTER 
Almond butter is more difficult to make than peanut

stand about ten minutes in a colander; then roll in sugar, 
and turn again into the colander, which should have rather

APPLE SAUCE 

Much time, effort, and material may be saved by the 
following method of stewing apples: Wash the fruit, re- 
move decayed portions, cut in quarters, and remove only 
a small portion of stem and blossom ends. No harm comes 
from cooking sound cores and skins. Pass through a fine 
colander, and sweeten. If they were cooked in very little 
water, the portion remaining in the colander may be mois- 
tened, and thus a trifle more of pulp be saved.

These are mostly made from water, sugar, and the 
juice of fruit. When fresh fruit is not obtainable, juices 
or pulp which have been canned may be substituted. Fruit 
jellies may be dissolved in hot water and then frozen. As 
fruits vary in sweetness, it is advisable to test the mix- 
tures before all the sugar or sirup called for in the recipe 
is added. A mixture which seems sweet enough before 
freezing, will be found to be lacking in sweetness after 
freezing. If a rich fruit ice or sherbet is desired, the 
pure fruit juice may be used without the addition of any 
water. Sherbets are practically the same as fruit ice, only 
that gelatine, egg whites, or corn-starch have been added to 
give more body to the preparation. The texture of fruit 
ice is often more or less granular and icy, more like wet 
snow. The sherbets are often so much like the cream ices, 
that it is difficult to believe that there is no cream in them. 

If the sugar is boiled with the water, a finer grained ice 
will be the result. 

There are many freezers on the market, but the one 
having a double motion is the most satisfactory. To pre- 
pare the ice, one should provide oneself with a grain sack 
and something with which to break the ice. A 2 x 4 about 
two and one half feet long, with one end prepared for a 
handle, is desirable. Or an iron pipe of the same length 
may be used. Place the ice in a sack, and hold the open 
end in the left hand while you strike with the bludg- 
eon in the right, occasionally turning the sack. When

ICES AND SHEEBETS 221 

sufficiently beaten, empty the ice into a tight box, pick out 
the pieces too large for use, and return them to the sack. 
Better results will be obtained from finely crushed ice; if 
the pieces are too large, they are liable to dent the freezer. 

Mix the coarse salt with the crushed ice in the box, 
and from it pack the freezer. Authorities differ in refer- 
ence to the proportion of ice and salt to be used. Some 
say one of salt to three of ice ; others one of the former to 
seven of the latter. Too much salt causes the finished 
product to be coarse-grained. It is possible to freeze a 
batch of fruit ice with ice and salt left from a former 
freezing, although it may have become somewhat liquefied ; 
so do not think it necessary to refill the freezer because 
some water is seen with the ice and salt. Freezers which 
are properly constructed have an outlet for water just 
below the level of the top of the freezing can, and not in 
the bottom as some might suppose. 

Fine salt will accomplish the desired end, but the 
coarse is cheaper and better. 

Care should be exercised to keep the bearings, gear, 
and sockets of the freezer frequently oiled. 

If only a small batch of ice is to be frozen, the freezer 
need not be packed its full depth. 

When the mixture is frozen, remove the paddle, scrape, 
off the ice, cover the can, place a cork in the hole in the 
cover, and throw over all the wet sack in which the ice 
was broken. Keep in a cool place until time to serve. 

To produce a soft, creamy texture, the freezer should be 
turned continually and rapidly until the mixture is hard. 

Always turn the freezer to the right. If turned to the 
left, the contents which lie nearest the outside of the

BEVERAGES 



CARAMEL CEREAL 

A Substitute for Coffee 

For each cup of the beverage required, use tw© table- 
spoonfuls of the cereal, and boil for ten to twenty minutes. 
Then remove to the side of the range, and let steep a few 
minutes. The strength and aroma of cereal coffee are de- 
veloped by long steeping. 

CHOCOLATE 
Sanitas 

To each two ounces of Sanitas chocolate, allow one 
cup of cold water. Let it stand until the chocolate is 
soft, place over the fire, and after it boils, cook one minute. 
Work it briskly with an egg beater, then serve at once, 
adding at the last moment a tablespoonful of whipped 
cream to each cup. 

It is considered an improvement by some to use two 
thirds chocolate and one third malted nuts. 

Other chocolate is not recommended, as it contains an 
• injurious alkaloid, which in the Sanitas brand is removed 
by a special process.

Flavor to suit, mix well, and garnish with a half spoonful 
of the white. 

Either part or all of the milk may be left out, and 
fruit juice added in its place. 

FRUIT NECTAR 

For every eight parts of other fruit juice used, add one 
part of lemon juice, and sweeten to taste. A combination 
of fruit juices, as grape, cherry, and raspberry, makes a 
very fine nectar. Always include the lemon juice. The 
nectar should be served ice-cold. 

STRAWBERRY NECTAR 

Ripe strawberries, crushed, 4 cups. 
Water, 4 cups. 
Lemon, sliced very thin, 1. 
Sugar, 2 cups. 

Mix all together, and let stand in a glass or earthen jar 
for two hours ; strain through a coarse cloth, and keep on 
ice until served. 

LEMONADE NO. 1 . 

The best lemonade is made from lemon sirup. Into the 
juice of twelve lemons grate the rind of six. Be careful 
to exclude all seeds and the inner white skin, as they 
impart a bitter taste. Let stand overnight. Make 'thick 
sirup of white sugar, and when cold strain the lemon juice

into it. A tablespoonful added to ^ glass of water makes 
a perfect lemonade. 

PINEAPPLE LEMONADE 

Lemon juice, % cup. 
Pineapple juice, 1 cup. 
Sugar, 1 cup. 
Water, 1 quart. 

Bring the water and sugar to a boil, cool, and add 
lemon and pineapple juices. Serve ice-cold. 

ORANGEADE

Boil sugar and water together ten minutes to make a 
sirup; then add the orange juice, and let it cool. When 
cold, pour into goblets half filled with cracked ice.

KITCHEN UTENSILS 



i 

J 



^ 



No room in the house or institution requires more care 
and painstaking effort in the matter of furnishing than 
the kitchen. A large part of the health and comfort of 
the family depends upon the success of this all-important 
room. A good kitchen outfit is one of the foundation stones 
of good housekeeping. 

NUMBER OP UTENSILS 

The number of cooking utensils will depend upon the 
size of the household and the extent of work to be done. 
It is unwise to lay in a large stock of all possible articles 
just because there is a possibility of their being used at 
some time. The better plan is to secure the necessary 
articles first, and buy the others as occasion may demand. 
This list should not be curtailed for the sake of display in 
some other department where less depends upon the re- 
sult. It is true economy to buy the best quality and of 
simple construction. 

Kitchen utensils should have a smooth surface, and 
be light enough to handle well and heavy enough to be 
durable. They should be of such material as will not dis- 
color the food prepared in them and will stand a high 
temperature without becoming rough. They should be suf- 
ficiently solid not to absorb flavors and thus transmit them 
to other preparations.

GRANITEWARE 

For the preparation of cooked salad dressings, cooking 
of fruits, desserts, etc., graniteware is very desirable; 
but in many cases aluminum is displacing granite. 

TINWARE 

Such articles as steamers, cake tins, strainers, graters, 
flour scoops, molds for puddings, measures, milk pans, dip- 
pers, cutters, flour sieves,-, funnels, salt shakers, dust-pans, 
bread tins, strainers, and boxes for meal and bread, cake, 
etc.', can as well be of tin as of more expensive material. 

A tin pie pan will render good service for a time, but 
is liable to discolor the crust. For this and other reasons 
we recommend granite pie pans. It is not profitable to 
purchase tin teakettles if durability is considered. 

STEELWARE 

Iron utensils can not be used for cooking fruit or any 
food substance containing acids, as they discolor the food 
and destroy the flavor. Steelware, though more expensive 
at first, is cheaper in the long run, both in the home and in 
institutions, because of its practicability and lasting quali- 
ties. Where the granite is chipped it is irreparable, while 
a steel kettle can be retrimmed at a small expense. 

WOOD 

The following articles made of wood are serviceable: 
molding boards, rolling-pins, spoons, potato mashers, chop- 
ping-bowls, paddles for stirring, rollers for towels, pie 
markers.

KITCHEN UTENSILS 237 

GENERAL UTENSILS NEEDED IN THE KITCHEN 

Stone jars for butter, jugs, knives, egg beater, steel 
dish-cloth, tablespoons, iron spoons, lemon squeezer, cake 
turner, skimmer, can opener, ice pick, batter whips, steels, 
apple corer, scales, scrubbing and vegetable brushes, 
brooms, roll bakers, iron gem pans, toasters, saucepans, 
corkscrew, refrigerator. 

For mincing such foods as cold potatoes, beets, fruit, 
etc., choppers may be made by melting oflf the ends of small 
tin cans on top of a hot stove. A can should be selected 
that has been opened on the end not containing the inner 
circular piece of tin. After melting off the whole of the 
smooth end, the small round piece on the other end can 
be melted off without removing the whole end, if it is set on 
a red hot stove for a short time. While the can is still 
hot, run the back of a vegetable knife around the edge to 
remove the rough solder. Use this chopper on food in a 
flat pan to keep the food from spreading. 

Bread, pie, and cake tins should be placed in the oven 
before using the first time, and be heated until they are 
tarnished. This will give the food baked in them a better 
color. 

A vegetable mill is almost indispensable to a kitchen. 
This with its various dies may be used for grinding onions, 
nuts, stale bread, legumes, corn for kornlet, etc. 

Some of the articles shown in the accompanying illus- 
tration should be found in every kitchen. Experience has 
taught us that it is to the advantage of every cook to have 
a reasonable number of labor-saving devices at hand. 

A bakery brush such as is shown in the illustration is

very handy for brushing up the flour from the molding 
board. 

The spatula has so many uses that a person who once 
finds out its value, will never be without one. 

The peel is very convenient for removing pies, gem 
pans, and such articles from the hot oven. 

For one of the uses of the pie marker, see Unf ermented 
Rolls. 

For beating large quantities of eggs and many other 
things, the batter whip is indispensable. 

The pastry brush is used to brush the tops cf two- 
crust pies. See Pastry Glazing. 

The cake tin shown in the illustration is desirable, be- 
cause the cake can be so easily removed. The same results, 
however, can be obtained by placing in the bottom of the 
tin an oiled piece of manila paper. 

The trough scraper is a convenient article for scra- 
ping the dough from the board or table, as well as clean- 
ing the trough. 

There are several varieties of flour sieves, but one sim- 
ilar to that shown in the cut is the most practical. It 
can be used to strain thin sauces and soups, as well as for 
flour. 

For family use the steamer here shown is very prac- 
tical, as it can be set over a pie tin with water in it, 
or over a large kettle. 

rs of the shape shown in the cut are better 
more flaring bottoms, because they take up 
e stove. 

)resented in the illustration is very service- 
ng dirt from such articles as beans, pea-

KITCHEN UTENSILS 239 

nuts, etc. If the seedless raisins from which it is so dif- 
ficult to remove the stems, are placed in this, and vigor- 
ously rubbed, good results will be obtained. 

The milk pan strainer is the right size to fit an eight 
quart double boiler; and having a flare bottom, it is very- 
handy for straining soups, tomatoes, etc. 

The Chinese strainer is serviceable for such work as 
washing raw rice, and straining thin gravies, sauces, and 
soups. 

The metal batter bowl is not so likely to be broken, and 
for all-round purposes is more practical than the earthen 
ware. 

The vegetable mill shown in the accompanying illustra- 
tion can be so adjusted as to cut fine or coarse slices. It 
also has a device for pushing the vegetables to be cut, 
toward the cutting knives, so that there need be no danger 
of cutting the fingers. 

There are many varieties of food grinders. The one 
shown in the cut is a good one, having several dies. The 
kitchen equipment is not complete without it. 

The asbestos mat is especially convenient where one is 
cooking over gas or oil fires, or where one wishes some 
article to cook slowly. 

Gem pans similar to those here shown, are preferable 
to the ones having flat bottoms. 

A soapstone griddle will be found a great aid in pro- 
ducing desirable hot cakes or in broiling protose, nuttolene, 
and the like. Food preparations are not so liable to stick 
to such a griddle, therefore less oil need be used. 

A pan used for the preparation of omelets should not 
be used for anything else.

FOOD TABLES 



In the accompanying tables of food values, published 
by Prof. W. 0. Atwater, Ph.D., in a bulletin of the United 
States Agricultural Department, the nutritive food ele- 
ments are classified under four heads: protein, or that 
which builds muscle and other tissue; fat and carbohy- 
drates, which supply heat and energy; and the ash, or 
mineral, which contains elements needed to repair bones 
and nerves. Gluten, found principally in wheat ; albumen, 
in eggs and meat; casein, in milk; fibrin, in flesh; and 
legumin, in legumes, are protein. Carbohydrates include 
'Starch and sugar. According to scientific research, it has 
been found that to nourish the body properly it must be 
supplied with about five times as much of the carbohy- 
drates as of the protein. 

This is a matter all should understand, for thus much 
inconvenience may be avoided.

a Fruits contain a certain portion of inedible materials, as skin, seeds, etc., 
which are properly classed as refuse. In some fruits, as oranges and prunes, 
the amount rejected in eating is practically the same as refuse. In others, as 
apples and pears, more or less of the edible material is ordinarily rejected with 
the skin and seeds and other inedible portions. The edible material which is 
thus thrown away, and should properly be classed with the waste, is here 
classed with the refuse. The figures for refuse here given represent, as nearly 
as can be ascertained, the quantities ordinarily rejected.

I FOOD COMBINATIONS

If one would obtain the best result from food, certain 
rules in regard to its combination should be observed. This 
instruction applies to all, but more particularly to the 
cook who has the framing of the bill of fare for the home. 
We recommend simplicity in diet, bringing in variety, not 
by having many kinds at one meal, but by varying from 
meal to meal. Therefore such foods as are placed on the 
table should be those that combine well. For example, a 
fruit dessert such as berry pie should not be served with 
a vegetable dinner. Squash or custard pie might be served 
in its place. If it is desired to serve a fruit dessert, such 
foods as rice, macaroni, and nut foods might accompany it. 
If a careful study is made of this phase of dietetics, much 
good will follow. Study the classifications given below. 

GOOD COMBINATIONS 

Grains and eggs. Grains and fruits. 

Grains and vegetables. Milk and grains. 

BAD COMBINATIONS 

Fruit and vegetables. Sugar and milk. 

Fats with fruits^ or vegetables. Milk and meat. 

The weights given in the following table are for one 
cup of the articles mentioned.

By practise one is enabled to guess quite accurately as 
to the amount of grain to be used with any given amount 
of water in tlie cooking of cereals. For the benefit of be- 
ginners and any who wish to be accurate, the following 
table is given. It is not our purpose to make this list an 
extensive one, as good judgment will tell one that various, 
grains of the same nature, will require the same amount 
of water; for instance, rolled oats and rolled wheat 



GRAIN WATER 

Oatmeal 1 part 4 parts 

Boiled oats 1 ' * 3 

Pearl barley 1 * * 5 

Cracked wheat 1 * * 4^^ 

Boiled rye 1 '' 3

Corn-meal 1 * * 4 

Cream of wheat 1 ' ' 4 

Graham 1 * * 3 

Steamed rice * 1 " 2 

Browned rice 1 * * 3 



The time required for cooking depends on the kind of 
cereal, and upon the method by which it is cooked. The 
first seven given in this list are more wholesome when 
cooked from three to five hours. The last four will cook 
properly in one half to one hour.

GENERAL SUGGESTIONS 



i 



Add a little milk or lemon juice to the water in which 
corn is to be cooked. 

The addition of a small amount of sugar to field peas 
will improve them and make them almost like garden peas. 

Allow raisins to stand in boiling water for a few min- 
utes if you wish to remove the stones. 

In baking potatoes, cut off one end, so that the steam 
will have an opportunity to escape. They will then come 
out more mealy and dry. A novel method is to cut off a 
narrow paring all around the potato. 

To keep celery, roll it in manila paper and then in a 
cloth. Keep in a dark, cool place. 

In baking custards and other preparations where it is 
desired to set one pan inside of another with water be- 
tween them, it will be found convenient to use an iron 
dish-cloth to separate the two pans. 

To remove the disagreeable odor of onion from the 
hands, rub them with freshly mixed mustard, and then 
rinse well. 

To prevent new enameled ware from cracking, grease 
the inside with butter before using. 

To make water bottles, vases, and the like look clear, 
add cut lemons to the water, and shake well. 

If by mistake eggs are boiled longer than intended, 
drop them in cold water, and allow to remain for half 
a minute.

Wrap ice with paper or flannel sheet to keep from 
melting. 

To preserve the freshness of a cake or batch of cookies, 
and to impart a delicate flavor, place an orange or a cut 
apple in the box with them. 

Fit your pie paste to the tin by using a chunk of bread 
dough instead of your hand. Bake your pie shells between 
two pie tins to keep from blistering. Don't put the filling 
in hot, or the crust will be tough. 

Grind dough for sticks in a vegetable mill instead of 
pounding or pulling it. EoU it out about one half inch 
thick, and mark it oflf with a pie marker. It saves time. 

Bake meringue in a slow oven and it will be thicker. 

GARNISHING 

Garnishing of dishes has a great deal to do with the 
appearance of a dinner table. Each dish should be suffi- 
ciently garnished, yet not done to excess. 

With a potato ball cutter, scoop out balls from gela- 
tine mold or jelly which is solid enough to hold its form. 
Use these in garnishing desserts or sweet entrees. 

The attractiveness of a roast is much enhanced if gar- 
nished with fresh mashed potatoes as it can be tastily done 
by forcing them through a pastry bag and tube. Mayon- 
naise or other salad dressings may be added to salads in 
the same way. Nut butter, when thick, may be dropped 
on the butter chips from a pastry tube in a very attractive 
manner.

I TABLE ETIQUETTE AND RULES % 

% FOR WAITERS I 

i 



TABLE ETIQUETTE 

The refinement of an individual, and the nature of the 
home training, are nowhere more clearly revealed than 
at the table. Carelessness in regard to good table manners 
shows thoughtlessness for the feelings of others unfortu- 
nate enough to be dining at the same table, and will 
probably be looked upon as ignorance and lack of culture. 
For this reason good table etiquette should be insisted 
upon at the family table. This will insure good manners 
in the presence of guests or when entertained away from 
home. 

The following suggestions on table etiquette are of fun- 
damental importance, and will be found applicable to all 
occasions. 

GENERAL TABLE ETIQUETTE 

When giving a dinner, avoid crowding the table, as the 
serving can be done more effectively and with less annoy- 
ance to the guests where the chairs are not crowded to- 
gether. 

Quests should remain standing until the hostess seats 
herself. 

When a gentleman has accompanied a lady to the di- 
ning-room, he should see that she is first seated before 
taking his own place. 

Necessary introductions should be given before the 

guests are seated, and never afterward.

252 VEGETARIAN COOK BOOK 

The napkin should be unfolded below the level of the 
table ; and in wiping the lips, should be used as inconspicu- 
ously as possible. . 

A gentleman places his half unfolded napkin over the 
left knee. It should never be tucked under the chin or 
in the waistcoat. 

Unless one is at home, the napkin should not be folded 
at the close of the meal. 

Seat yourself quietly at the table, without dragging the 
chair forward; and in rising do not push the chair back 
from the table before attempting to rise. 

Sit in an upright position at the table, without leaning 
back in the chair or forward against the table. 

Never sit with the elbows on the table nor extended from 
the body when eating. 

Keep your feet in front of the chair, and not twisted 
around its legs nor extended too far under the table. 

In eating, do not lean over the plate nor incline the head 
to meet every mouthful. 

Keep the hands away from the face and the head, and 
when possible avoid coughing. 

It is never good manners to read at the table when others 
are present. 

Do not toy with the fork, knife, spoons, or anything 
about your plate. 

In serving, do not heap the plates. 

Always serve ladies first. 

In passing the plate for more, always place the knife 
and fork parallel on the right side of the plate, with tiHes 
of fork turned up, and do not continue eating until the 
plate has been returned.

TABLE ETIQUETTE 253 

In asking for anything at the table, address by name 
the one who can most conveniently serve you. 

When a plate is offered to you by the one serving, do, 
not pass it to some one else unless asked to do so. 

Do not refuse to take the last piece on a plate, as there 
is supposed to be more. 

Should you observe that something is desired by an- 
other, do not hesitate to pass it, lifting the dish in do- 
ing so. 

Never lean forward across the table to reach for any- 
thing, nor reach in front of others. 

Never take so large a mouthful that you can not con- 
veniently speak. 

Chew the food with the mouth closed, and as quietly as 
possible. 

Eat slowly. Eapid eating is a violation of good man- 
ners, and the laws oi health as well. 

The last bit of food in the mouth should be swallowed 
before leaving the table. 

Be careful not to soil the table-cloth. No waste matter 
should be laid on it. 

Salt should not be put on the table-cloth. 

If anything objectionable is found in the food, never 
betray the fact to others. 

Do not embarrass hostess or guests by appearing to 
notice accidents. 

Never speak. about the excellence of your own food or 
dishes, nor offer apologies for them. 

Never urge a guest to eat food which he has declined. 

Never put toothpicks on the table, nor use them at the 
table.

254 VEGETABIAN COOK BOOK 

At a public dining-room, ladies as well as gentlemen al- 
ways rise from the table if another stops to speak to them. 

At a private table, never leave until all have finished. 

Ladies should pass out of the dining-room before the 
gentlemen. 

Knives and forks should be held so that the handles rest 
in the palms of the hands ; and in using a knife, the fore- 
finger rests on the upper part of the blade. 

When it is necessary to use both knife and fork, the 
knife is held in the right hand and the fork in the left. 
In this case the food should be carried to the mouth with 
the fork in the left hand. It is never proper to transfer 
the fork from one hand to the other, but it should be used 
with ease in either hand. 

Hold the fork in the right hand in courses where no 
knife is required. 

Never carry food to the mouth with the knife. 

Do not use the back of the fork to carry food to the 
mouth. 

Never substitute a spoon where the fork can be used. 

Do not entirely fill the spoon, nor overload the fork. 

Do not hold the handle of the spoon in the palm of the 
hand. . 

Carry the food to the mouth with an inward movement 
of the hand. 

Hold the fork or spoon in a sidewise position when eat- 
ing, and not with the handle pointing toward the opposite 
side of the table. 

If the knife, fork, or spoon is accidentally dropped, in- 
stead of reaching for it, ask for another. 

When through using the knife and fork, lay them on

the plate parallel to each other, the knife being on the 
right, with the sharp edge next to the fork, and the tines 
of the fork down. 

PROPEE MANNER OF EATING VARIOUS FOODS 

Soup should be eaten from the side of the spoon, and 
without the noise of sipping. It should be dipped up with 
the side of the spoon toward the farther side of the plate. 
Never tip up the plate in eating. 

Thickening the soup with crumbs is bad fomu 

In eating bouillon, the spoon is used until only a little 
liquid is left. This remaining portion may be drunk from 
the cup, which is lifted by one of its handles. 

Vegetables and made dishes are eaten with a fork. 

The spoon is used for soft desserts cooked fruits, and 
fresh fruits served with cream. 

Remove bread from the plate with the fingers, and never 
with a fork. 

Do not cut the bread, but break it, and butter each piece 
as it is needed. To butter the bread, do not hold it in the 
hand, but lay it on the side of the plate. 

When drinking coffee or any beverage served in cups, 
remove the spoon before lifting the cup to the lips. 

Place the spoon in the saucer when not using it. 

When drinking, look into the cup or glass. 

Never blow into a cup or soup dish to cool its contents. 

Never drink from a saucer. 

Before drinking from a glass, always wipe the lips. 

Lift a goblet by the stem, and take hold of tumblers 
just below the center. . 

Do not bend the head backward when drinking, nor tip 
the glass or cup too much.

GENEEAL EULES FOE WAITEES 

This chapter has been prepared after years of experience 
in conducting public dining-rooms, and includes instruc- 
tions which will greatly aid in the training of inexperienced 
waiters and in reducing their work to a system. Each

PERSONAL SUGGESTIONS TO WAITERS 

1. Always be pleasant and courteous. 

2. Be constantly on the alert to supply every need of

distinctly, so as to avoid delays that would come from a 
misunderstanding. 

6. Handle the dishes carefully, and so avoid all possi- 
bility of embarrassing accidents. 

7. In placing dishes on the table, do not push them 
against one another, but handle them with as little noise

FAMILY DINNER WITHOUT SERVANTS 

The aim of every housekeeper should be to set a table 
that will be attractive in appearance, even though the food 
may be of the plainest. To this end everything to be used 
upon the table should be scrupulously clean — the cloth 
should be fresh and smoothly ironed, the dishes carefully 
washed and polished, and the silver bright. Neatness and 
order in arranging the table appointments are essential. 
Carelessness in n these matters encourages carelessness in 
table manners. 

LAYING THE TABLE 

Cover the table with a silence cloth. This may be of 
felt or canton flannel, and serves as a protection to the

polished table, improves the appearance of the table-cloth, 
adds to its wearing qualities, and deadens the sound made 
by setting down the dishes. 

Place the linen cloth over the silence cloth smoothly, 
and with its center exactly in the center of the table. As 
a matter of economy as well as appearance, a cloth of good 
quality will be found most satisfactory. 

A centerpiece of flowers or ferns is a desirable addition 
for all occasions, and may be tastefully arranged with al- 
most endless variety. 

Place the desired number of service plates around the 
table in symmetrical order. The plates and silver should 
be laid about one inch from the edge of the table. 

Place the knife on the right of the plate, with the sharp 
edge turned toward it; and next to the knife the soup 
spoon, with the bowl up. 

On the left of the plate place the dinner fork, with the 
tines up. 

The forks and spoons for other courses are placed on 
the table as needed. 

Place the folded napkin squarely on the table to the left 
of the fork. 

At the right of the plate and opposite the point of the 
knife, place the glass. 

Place the olives and salted almonds on the table on 
either side of the centerpiece and in line with it. 

THE SIDEBOAED 

After laying the table, see that the sideboard contains 
the fruit juice, and a pitcher of water in case it should be

preferred, forks and spoons for later courses, and a bowl 
of cube sugar with the tongs. It should also contain finger- 
bowls, two thirds full of tepid water. These, with dessert- 
spoons, should be placed on doilies on the dessert plates. 

SIDE TABLE 

On the side table place tablespoons, a carving knife 
and fork, a tray covered with a doily, extra napkins and 
silver in case of emergencies, a crumb tray and scraper for 
removing crumbs, or a plate and napkin for that purpose. 

Plates for the hot courses should be kept warm, and 
those for salad and dessert should be chilled.

SECOND COUESB 

Place the roast, potatoes, and cauliflower, with carving 
set, tablespoons, and dinner plates, in front of the host, 
who serves first either the guest of honor or the hostess. 
In this latter case others at the table are served beginning 
at either the right or left of the hostess. Place the peas 
with side dishes and tablespoon before the hostess, who in 
serving passes them in regular order to those at the table. 

Set the bread on the table, to be passed throughout this
