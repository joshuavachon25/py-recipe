HSTTKODUCTIO^. 

There being Drawing-Boom Com- 
panions, Ladies' Companions, Floral 
Companions, Parlor Companions, &c, 
the idea was conceived that the 
Kitchen should not be neglected in 
this respect, and to fill the deficiency 
this little book is offered to the public 
as a " Kitchen Companion." Hoping 
it may be appreciated as its merits 
deserve, we leave it in your hands. 
The Author. 



[Entered according to Act of Congress in the year 
1809, by 

RICHARDS, WARREN & FLINT BROTHERS, 
in the Clerk's Office of the District Court of tho 
United States, in and for the Eastern District oi 
Pennsylvania.] 






®mt. 



There are few things which concern a com- 
munity more than the preparation of the food 
upon which the people depend for life, health 
and comfort, and it is a gratifying fact that 
science in its onward march is placing within 
the reach of all the means by which the 
average of human happiness may be much 
enhanced each year, simply by the render- 
ing of our daily fare more acceptable, and it 
is indeed a great consolation that, we may have 
good dinners oftener than heretofore, for it is an 
admitted fact that the sympathies of men are 
more readily reached through their stomachs 
than any other way; it has been said that if you 
wish to ask a favor of any one select a time just 
after a good meal has been partaken, and no 
doubt the better the meal the more readily will 
the favor be granted (Wives who have not learned 
this fact by experience should make a note of it). 
The idea has been set forth and cherished, that 
the husband and ihe children are entitled to as 
much consideration as occasional guests, and 
the meals stiould be as tempting to the appetite, 
and the table ought to be set out as carefully and 
neatly every day as on special occasions. A 
gentleman whose better-half had not adopted 
this as her rule, played off a rich joke upon her 
one day. He addressed her a note, politely in- 



4 HOME. 

forming her that a gentleman of her acquaint- 
tance — an old and true friend — would dine with 
her that day. Upon reception ®f the word all 
hands went to work to get everything in order. 
Precisely at twelve o'clock she was prepared to 
receive her guest. The house was as clean as a 
pin; a sumptuous dinner was on the table, and 
she was arrayed in her best attire. A gentle 
knock was heard, and she started with a palpi- 
tating heart to the door. She thought it must 
be an old friend, perhaps a brother from the 
place whence they had once moved. On opening 
the door she saw her husband with a smiling 
countenance. 

"Why, my dear." said she in anxious tone, 
" where is the gentleman of whom you spoke in 
your note ?" 

"Why," replied the husband complacently, 
" here he is. " 

"You said a gentleman of my acquaintance — ■ 
an old and true friend — would dine with us to- 
day." 

" Well," said he good humoredly, " am I not a 
gentleman of your acquaintance, an old and true 
friend ?" 

"Oh!" she cried distressingly, "is there no- 
body but you ?" 

"No." 

"Well, I declare this is too bad," said the wife 
in a disappointed tone. 

The husband laughed immoderately, and then 
they both laughed, and finally they sat down 
cosily together and enjoyed a good dinner, with- 
out having company, and they have done so many 
times since. 



HOME. 5 

In the following pages will be found a variety 
of practical recipes of incalculable value to the 
housewife, ami no one can read them without 
being struck by the good sense which pervades 
them. It is amusing to notice the indefinitencss 
of most of the recipes which are floating through 
the newspapers. They presuppose experience 
and knowledge, and remind one of Dinah's 
recipe for making "delicious cornbread. " 

" Why, Darlin'," she said when asked how it 
was made, "sometimes gen'ally I takes a little 
meal, an' sometimes gen'ally I takes a little 
flour; an I kind o' mixes 'em with hot water; an' 
I puts in eggs 'nough, an' a little salt, an' then I 
bakes it just 'bout 'nough, an' you do so, jist so, 
honey, an' you'll make 'em good as I do." This 
is a fair sample of every day recipes, but care 
has been taken in those, here published, to make 
them intelligible to all. The superiority of Fla- 
voring Extracts as a means of flavoring (and all 
cooking and pastry should be properly flavored) 
will be readily perceived by their use. Take 
Lemon for instance ; by the use of the Ex- 
tract the pure flavor alone is communi- 
cated; use the peel, and the bitter qualities 
are mingled, and often your pies or pud- 
dings are spoiled. In all things we should 
use the best means, for they are open to 
to all ; a man may dig with a pitch fork, but is 
it the best instrument? It is important also 
that good Extracts be used, therefore ask your 
grocer or druggist for Knights' make, 
and lake no o.iic-r, and you may rest assured that 
you will get an article worthy of your confidence. 
See advertisement on the back cover of this book.

place in a freezer ; then place the freezer in a 
bucket and put broken ice and salt around it 
alternately so as to touch every part, and press 
it down tightly. Agitate the cream by turning

Blanc Mange, Junket, Sauces, Soups, Gravies, 

Puddings, Cakes, and all fancy cooking. 

These extracts were established in 1845, and 
an experience of nearly twenty-five years in 
their manufacture, warrants us in claiming for 
them the first place in the market. Their supe- 
riority consists in their great strength, perfect 
purity and delicacy of flavor, which is readily 
perceived by their use, being scientifically pre- 
pared by careful and experienced hands, from 
the choicest Fruits, Flowers, &c, and possessing 
their essential properties in the most concen- 
trated form, free from all woody or inert sub- 
stance, crude or bitter qualities, and the pure 
flavor alone being communicated. 

The following are the flavors : 
Vanilla, Lemon, Strawberry, Green Gage, 
Ginger, Cloves, Jargonel Pear, Allspice, 
Almond, Celery, Nectarine, Nutmeg, 

Peach, Mace, Orange, Pineapple, 

Apricot, Cinnamon, Raspberry, Rose. 

The above are not common Essences, but 
pure Extracts.

EXTRACT. 13 

EXTRACT TANIIIA. 

This delightful flavor, which is so well known 
nnd so much admired, because of its general use 
in the flavor of Ice Cream, is manufactured from 
the bean of the "Vanilla Aromatica," a plant' of 
peculiar growth, the best varieties of which we 
receive from Mexico ; it is a climbing, shrubby, 
aerial plant, which commences its growth in the 
crevices of rocks, or on the trunks of trees, sus- 
pending itself to contiguous objects, and finally 
becomes detached from the original support, be- 
ing truly an serial plant. Our agent in Mexico 
gives us some interesting accounts of the mode 
of preparing the fruit or beans for market, which, 
however, our space will not permit us to publish 
here. Our preparation of Vanilla possesses the 
peculiar flavor of the fruit to a great degree, and 
readily communicates its properties to pastry 
and fancy cooking generally. 

Directions for Use. — When it is possible it 
should be added after the article is removed from 
the fire, and be thoroughly stirred in while cool- 
ing. The quantity used should be governed by 
the taste — usually about a teaspoonful to the 
pint. For acid sauces, as apples, &c, it is better 
to mix cold a short time before using. If mixed 
while hot, the quantity must be increased, as a 
great portion of the strength is evaporated or lost. 

Iii purchasing, be sure to get Knight's 
Extracts, for there are many worthless 
articles in the market. 



14 RECIPES. 

Sugar Doughnuts. — Dissolve one teaspoonful 
of soda in two-thirds of a cup of milk, then add 
three eggs, one and a half cups sugar, and two 
teaspoonsful butter well beaten together; add to 
the mixture as much flour as will make it stiff 
enough to roll; a little salt and a teaspoonful 
Extract Nutmeg should be added to the milk. 

Sponge Cake. — Take three eggs, one cup 
sugar, one and a half cups of flour, seven table- 
spoonsful milk, a little salt, half teaspoonful soda. 
half teaspoonful cream of Tartar, one teaspoonful 
Extract Lemon ; beat all together and bake. 

Cocoa-nut Pudding. — Melt two ounces butter, 
stir in two ounces sugar, boil up for a moment, 
when cool grate in two ounces cocoa-nut, and 
two ounces shred citron, one teaspoonful Ex- 
tract Lemon, and four eggs well beaten ; put 
into cups and bake half an hour, or in one large 
dish and bake longer. 

Cottage Pudding. — Three cups flour, one cup 
sugar, one cup milk, two tablespoonsful butter,

one half hour; serve with sauce made in the 
following manner :

sugar, beaten to a cream; then add half pint 
boiling water, and when cool, add two table- 
spoonsful wine, and one teaspoonful Extract 
Vanilla.

EXTRACTS. ' 17 

EXTRACT OF LEMOX. 

This flavor is used probably more than any 
other except Vanilla, and is deservedly a very- 
popular flavoring agent. It is procured front 
the lemons which come principally from Mes- 
sina. Our Extract of Lemon is prepared with 
great care, and is recommended as a flavor 
which will retain its sweetness for any length 
of time' being on this account much superior to 
the oil or the ordinary essences, which are so 
common in the market, and which are liable to 
become rancid by age. It is so purified and 
concentrated, that a few drops possesses the 
strength of a lemon, and can be used at any 
season of the year, even when the fruit cannot 
be obtained, and is really much cheaper. As an 
addition to pastry, cooking, icecream, jellies, &c, 
this flavor will be found invaluable, used accord- 
ing to the directions given for Extract Vanilla. 



EXTRACT OF CELERY. 

This Extract possesses the peculiar flavor of 
the plant to a great degree, and may be used 
whenever that flavor may be desired. To chicken 
salad it proves a most excellent addition. It 
may also be added to soups, gravies, &c. 



In one dozen bottles of Knight's Ex- 
tracts, is condensed the flavor of a 
bushel of fruit.

tract Orange, and one tablespoonful Extract 
Lemon, or other flavors if desired, and strain

nary dishes as may be desired ; set it in a cold 
place and let it stand for several hours. This

of water, when tender, add salt and pepper, a 
gill of milk, and thicken with pounded cracker ;

fire, add two teaspoonsful Extract Celery, one 
teaspoonful Extract Cloves, one teaspoonful Ex- 
tract Mace. 

Fancy Flavors. — By a combination of two or 
more of Knight's Extracts, a variety of new 
flavors may be produced.

tion of flavoring Extracts to them will greatly 
improve their quality.

pound each, ten eggs, currants two pounds, 
raisins two pounds, stoned and chopped fine, 
one half pound citron, half tumbler of brandy,

Pleasant Beverages. — Take three table- 
spoonsful of syrup made as directed below, of 
whichever flavor is desired ; place into a tumbler 
and fill with ice water, mix thoroughly together. 
These will be found to be very pleasant drinks, 
the syrup being much superior to those made to 
sell in the stores. To create a foam, if it be de- 
sired, add half a teaspoonful of baking soda 
dissolved in a little water. 

Syrup of Strawberry. — Dissolve one tea- 
spoonful Tartaric acid in half a pint water, then 
add one pound white sugar, and place over the 
fire, stirring it until the sugar is dissolved ; 
strain, and when cold, add one 'tablespoonful 
Extract of Strawberry, and mix thoroughly to- 
gether. 

Syrup of Raspberry. — Make as above, sub- 
stituting Extract of Raspberry for Strawberry. 

Syrup Pineapple. — Make in the same way, 
using Extract Pineapple. 

Syrup Banana. — Make in the same way, 
using Extract Banana. 

In the same way may be made Syrups of 
Vanilla, Apricot, Lemon, Jargonel Pear, Necta- 
rine, Orange, and Green Gage. 

Raspberry Vinegar. — Take the Raspberry 
Syrup made as above, and add to one pint of it 
a tablespoonful of vinegar, and mix well together. 

Ladies who use Knight's Extracts, 
wonder how the}* got along without 
them. 



EXTRACTS. 21 

Extract of Strawberry, 
" Raspberry. 

" Pineapple, 

" Jargonel Pear. 

/ Th^se fruit Extracts may be used when over 
the flavor of the fruits which they represent is 
desired. They are manufactured in such man- 
ner, and so highly concentrated, that a small 
vial represents as much strength as a quart of 
the juice. A teaspoonful added to the pint of 
the article to be flavored will be about the 
proper proportion if added when cool. They 
are well adapted for Ice Creams, Jellies, Pud- 
dings, Syrups, &c. 

Extract of Bitter Almonds, 
" Peach. 

These extracts are used most, generally for 
flavoring cukes, being better adapted for this 
purpose than for jellies and sauces. Their fla- 
vor is too well known to require comment here, 
and by using Knight's Extracts 
the true flavor may be communicated as desired. 
About a teaspoonful to the pound of cake is the 
proportion generally used, but persons may 
flavor to suit their tastes, which will be readily 
ascertained by trial. 

Knight's Extracts have been in vise 
twenty-five years, and all who have 
used them speak well of them. 



22 RECIPES. 

Cream Marange. — A custard made of one 
pint of milk and four eggs, leaving out the 
whites of two; one tablespoonful Extract Va- 
nilla, two teaspoonsful Extract Rose; make it 
very sweet; dissolve one ounce of isinglass, and 
stir into the custard; beat to a froth one pint of 
rich cream, and when the custard is mixed with 
the isinglass, pour it over the frothed cream, 
stirring it well. Fix lady-fingers cakes or slices 
of sponge cake in the mould, and when the mix- 
tuae is cool, pour it in and set it on ice till 
served. If, when all mixed, the custard does 
not seem frothy, churn well with a whip-stick 
till it does, before putting it into the mould. 
The isinglass should be kept warm while the 
custard thickens, and then added. You may 
make a richer custard with ten eggs, leaving out 
the whites of six. With the whites you may 
make the snow.- 

Apple Pie Without Apples. — Grate two tea- 
fipoonsful of bread crumbs, take sufficient water 
to moisten thoroughly, a teaspoonful of Tartaric 
acid, sweeten to taste, mix Avell together, and let 
it come to a boil ; when cool, add two teaspoons- 
ful Extract Nutmeg and one teaspoonful Extract 
Lemon; then make your pie and use the above 
as you would stewed apples. This will make a 
pie that any one would pronounce a good apple 
pie. 

Nutmeg graters are rendered obsolete 
by the use of Knight's Extracts.

of loaf sugar, one teaspoonful Tartaric acid, 
one teaspoonful Extract Lemon, the whites of 
seven eggs with the shells. Boil all together for 
one half hour, then pass it through a thick 
flannel bag until clear. 

Numerous testimonials could be shown

best recommendation is their use.

EXTRACTS. 25 

Extract of Rose, 
" Orange. 

These extracts represent the true flavors of 
fhe flowers and fruit from which they are ob- 
tained, and may be used for all culinary pur- 
poses the same as Extract of Lemon. 

Extract Ginger. 

This Extract, so generally known and esteemed 
for its valuable medicinal properties and uses, is 
also capable of being advantageously used for 
culinary purposes, being made from the purest 
Jamaica Root in a very concentrated form. 
Syrup Ginger, made as on the previous page, 
makes a pleasant beverage when added to water. 
For making Ginger Cake, its use is far superior 
and much more convenient than the powdered, 
root, as the latter article varies very much on 
account of age and the impurities frequently 
found in it, whereas the extract is always of 
uniform strength. As a medicine, it will be 
found a valuable remedy in cases of Dyspepsia, 
Flatulency, Cholic, Cholera Morbus, Nausea, 
Sea Sickness, Cramps or Pain in the Stomach, 
Diarrhea, Gout, Rheumatism, AYeakness, De- 
bility, &c. 

Dose for an adult — From one-half to one tea- 
spoonful, to be taken in sweetened water. For 
children in proper proportion. 



Knight's Extract of Ginger may be 
used as a medicine or as a flavor. 



26 RECIPES. 

Pumpkin Custard.- — Take five pounds pump- 
kin, pare off the outside rind, discard it, then 
divide into slices, take three or four good-sized 
apples cut into small pieces, and put the pump- 
kin and apples together in a deep dish, adding 
one and a half pounds of moist sugar, two tea- 
spoonsful each Extracts Allspice, Cloves and 
Lemon, a teacupful sweet cider; mix together, 
cover the dish over with a thick, plain paste, 
bake in a steady oven for one hour. 

Spanish Biscuit. — Beat the yolks of eight 
eggs nearly one half hour, then beat in eight 
tablespoonsful of white sugar, then beat the 
whites of the eggs to a strong froth, then mix 
all well together, add four tablespoonsful of flour 
and two teaspoonsful Extract of Cinnamon, di- 
vide into biscuits, and bake on papers.

(omatoes well; then put to one gallon not 
strained one ounce of scraped horseradish and 
one teaspoonful Cayenne pepper, and salt to 
your taste ; boil this away to three quarts, and 
strain ; then add a pint of wine, half a pint of 
vinegar, one tablespoonful each Extracts Mace, 
Nutmegs and Cloves, mix well together. Bottle 
it and leave the bottles open two or three days, 
as it sometimes ferments a little, and requires 
scalding ; then cork tightly. 

Housekeepers who have become dis- 
gusted with common Extracts, are 
requested to try Knight's make. 



RECIPES. 27 

Eye Pan Cakes. — Prepare the lard as you 
would to fry doughnuts; take one tumblerful 
of milk, one of syrup or light molasses, piece 
of butter the size of a walnut, two teaspoonsful 
Extract Mace, one teaspoonful of soda, one egg, 
and a little salt. Put the soda with the milk, 
add the syrup, then the Extract of Mace, butter, 
salt and eggs, stir into this the rye until you 
have a rather stiff batter, then take another 
spoon, dip it into the hot lard, then take of the 
rye batter a piece about the size of an English 
walnut, and fry. By dipping the spoon into the 
hot lard the batter will drop nicely into the 
lard without scraggling. As it takes sometime 
to cook them through, the lard or fire should not 
be too hot. Eat with sauce flavored with Ex- 
tract Vanilla. 

Lemon Jelly. — Take one box Cox's Refined 
Gelatine, pour over it one quart boiling water, 
stir until all is dissolved, add a teaspoonful Tar- 
taric acid, four cups sugar; when it is all dis- 
solved, add the whites of four eggs well beaten, 
and let it boil up once over the fire, add two tea- 
spoonsful Extract Lemon ; strain into moulds or 
cups, and let it stand until stiff.

After supper, walk a mile."

28 RECIPES 

Graham Bread. — Take one coffee-cup of 
white flour, two of Graham flour, one of warm 
water, half a cup of yeast, and a little molasses, 
a small teaspoonful of salt, and half a teaspoon- 
ful of saleratus dissolved in the water. It should 
be made as stiff as can be stirred with a spoon. 
If you prefer to add a spoonful of Indian meal 
it should be scalded. Let it rise overnight, and 
when it is very light bake it about an hour in-a 
moderate heat. The above recipe will make one 
loaf of bread. 

Ham Toast. — This is very convenient to hand 
round with chicken or with roast veal, and also 
makes a tasty breakfast or luncheon dish. Mince 
very finely the lean of a slice or two of boiled 
ham, beat the yolks of two eggs and mix them with 
ham, adding as much cream or stock as will make 
it soft ; keep it long enough on the fire to warm 
it through — it may be allowed almost to boil, but 
should be stirred all the time. Have ready some 
buttered toast, cut it in round pieces, and lay 
the ham neatly on each piece. 

Svpertor Johnny Cake. — Two eggs, half a cup 
of molasses, half cup of sugar, half cup butter, 
one pint butter milk, one teaspoonful saleratus, 
a little salt, one teaspoonful Extract Allspice; 
make a batter with two-thirds meal and one- 
third flour. To be eaten warm, with butler. 

Knight's Extracts are unsurpassed for 
purity and strength. 



EXTRACTS. 29 

Extract of Nutmeg, 
" Cinnamon, 

" Cloves, 

" Allspice, 

" Mace. 

These Extracts, manufactured from the purest 
spices bearing their names, are of first quality, 
md are much more convenient than the powders 
rearing the same names, as the latter are fre- 
puently inert and worthless from age or inferi- 
)rity of quality, or adulterations with which 
hey are mixed, while the Extracts will retain 
heir strength and purity for any length of time, 
md in any climate. These Extracts are much 
nore desirable for spicing fish, pickles, &c, than 
he whole or powdered spices, because the flavor 
done is communicated without the woody por- 
ions. Extract of Nutmeg is much better for 
lavoring custards, &c, than the grated nutmeg, 
or it mingles with . the whole custard, whereas 
he Nutmeg itself always rises to the top. 

Extract of Apricot, 
" Green Gage, 

" Nectarine. 

These Extracts, though not so well known aa 
nany others, are nevertheless very much ad- 
aired by those who have used them. They may 
>e used whenever a fruit flavor is desired. 

Knight's flavors are excelled by none.

CIRCULAR, 31. 

The undersigned, having formerly been en- 
gaged in the manufacture and sale of Cooking 
ind Flavoring Extracts, in the city of

entire interest in the business, take pleasure 
in informing the public that my successors, 
Messrs. Richards, Warren & Flint Bro's, 
it No. 69 North Second Street, Philadelphia, 
have now the exclusive control of the business, 
ind are manufacturing the same quality of 
Flavors under the name of Knight's Cooking 
Extracts, from the original recipes formerly 
ised by me, and so favorably known in the 
market for the last twenty-five years. 

I cheerfully recommend them to my old

JgQp"' Housekeepers who have never used 
KNIGHT'S FLAVORING EXTRACTS. 

should certainly make a trial of them, to dis- 
cover their rich quality, and the great improve- 
ment they are to cooking and pastry. Tho^e 
who do not use them because they have never 
seen the benefit of them, are like old Major 
Foughy, who was opposed to the magnetic tele- 
graph before its introduction. He fought against 
it with all his power, yet in the progress of 
events, the poles were raised, and the wires were 
stretched, and the Major was called upon to 
behold the improvement. " I tell you, gentle- 
men," said he, "I have given my attention to 
this thing, and it will never work ; it may do 
for letters and small ■packages, but for large par- 
cels it is not worth a darn."

THE INCREASING DEMAND FOR 

Cooking Stats 

has caused the production of inferior 
articles by various parties, and the effee^ 
of such preparations in the market has 
been to injure the sale of reliable Ex- 
tracts, because people become disap- 
pointed in their use. 

We have studied to preserve the 
standard quality of our Extracts by 
availing ourselves of all improvements 
in their manufacture, and the result has 
been that we have been gratified by a 
steady increase in our business. 

To those who have not used Knight's

PLEASE MAKE A TRIAL OP THEM
