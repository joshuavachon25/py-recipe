p 



TjlOR several years ! had a Vegetarian Home at Belstone, on 
Dartmoor, and during the greater part of the time I had 



greater part o 

the services, as Manageress, of one who displayed an unusual 
aptitude for cooking. 

To her I am indebted for most of what appears in this books 
but the arrangement of it and the mode of presentation are. 
my own. 

Those who visited " Dartmoor House "—the name by which 
my Home was called — while Miss Isabel Densham was there^ 
bore frequent and unsolicited testimony, both by word of 
mouth and in writing, to the excellence of her cooking, and 
many, accustomed to the ordinary methods of living, and 
ignorant of the possibilities of Vegetarianism, expressed sur-- 
prise at the number and variety of the dishes set before them. 

During their sojourn they availed themselves of such 
opportunities as were afforded them of going into the kitchea 
and seeing what was done. 

Much information of a useful and fractical kind was thus, 
imparted, and the recipes of many of the more favourite dishes 
were copied out and given to be used elsewhere. 

Of course this could only be done in a fragmentary manner, 
30 I thought if 1 could bring these recipes together, and present 
them in a convenient and more permanent form, it might 
supply a want, as I know it fulfils the expressed desire of many. 

While acting in the capacity referred to Miss Densham 
carried out with perfect loyalty my instructions and intentions 
in the matter of diet, and, as everything that is here presented* 
has been tested over and over again, and been approved of by 
all sorts and conditions of people, I have no hesitancy in' 
recommending these menus to those who wish for ample, sus- 
taining and varied vegetarian meals. 



In putting into shape the material with which she provided 
Ue I sought to present things in such a way tliat those 
Ignorant of cooking, by following the instructions given, would 
have a satisfactory dinner to place upon the table as the result 
of their labours. 

I hope that in this I have succeeded. Having had ample 
experience of Vegetarian Cookery at hotels, restaurants and 
boarding-houses in our own country and on the continent as 
well as in the houses of the wealthy, and those in less affluent 
circumstances, I can without fear of contradiction say that the 
dishes here presented will compare favourably with any that 
I have seen or tasted, and the bills of fare may be regarded 
as samples of a good all-round Vegetarian diet. 

In this I do not speak of what is sometimes, but erroneously 
called "High-Class" Vegetarian Cookery, the outcome of 
which is the hot, condimented and curried preparations that 
those who value their health will scrupulously avoid, but which 
are often served up as examples of the "Art" in its highest 
perfection. 

If this be so I for one will never aspire to it. Such cookery 
in my opinion, is one of the curses of humanity, being provoca- 
tive of thirst, and acting as a powerful irritant upon the delicate 
mucous membrane of the stomach. I am rather thinking and 
writing of something different from this — something that is at 
once appetising, invigorating and healthful — that may serve as 
an example of what Vegetarianism is when its menus are 
judiciously arranged, and the articles appear in a dainty, 
palatable form on the table. 

That these recipes as they stand do qot correspond with the 
most advanced form of Vegetarian living I am perfectly aware. 
My object in the present instance was not the preientation ol 
an ideal, to those already convinced, but rather that which 
would appeal to my brothers and sisters who still regard flesh 
meat in some form or other as a necessity of life. 

To them I say, "Try what is here presented: the food Is 
wholesome, it is amply nutritious: it has been partaken and 
approved of by many like yourselves who had no previous 
experience of Vegetarian living : it will maintain you in health: 



in 



it will be sufficient foryou whatever 3rour station or occupation 
in life may be, and from the hygienic point of view it may be 
regarded as greatly superior to that which is usually spoken of 
an ordinary mixed diet." 

Recognising the partial character of this treatise as a repre- 
sentation of Vegetarianism I planned, and have to a large 
extent executed, a work dealing with the subject in its various 
aspects as it affects the different periods of life, as it affects 
growth and development, as it affects us in health and disease 
with dietaries suited to these different circumstances and 
conditions. 

This ! hope shortly to publish, but in the meantime I send 
the present book forth as it is. I can promise to those who 
purchase it that they will Bnd it practical: it is true to itself, 
and if it be not the whole truth about Vegetarianism it is at 
any rate the truth. 

I have now but to say in conclusion to all who value the 
precious gifts of life and health, "Give up eating those things 
that are in so many instances productive of disease. Avail 
yourselves of the abundant store that is ever to be found in 
the Vegetable Kingdom, whose products, full of life-giving 
energy and power, are at all times the main sustenance of the 
greater portion of the inhabitants of the globe."

A PACKET 

IN THE HAND] 

IS WORTH 

TWO 

IN THE SHOP. 

Buy a packet of GRAPE-NUTS to-day and! 
start the use of a food, one pound of which contains I 
more nourishment, that the human body will absorb. 
than several pounds of meat, bread, porridge, etc. 

The Canadian Government states that Grape-Nuts contains almost 
twice as much dextrin as any other food tested. Dextrin is the part 
that makes human energy. Also that GRAPE-NUTS is about two- j 
thirds more digestible than any other food. I 

The "Lancet" says : — "Our analysis shows ihat it is a nutritive of 
" high order, since it contains the constituents of a complete food in very 
"satisfactory and rich proportion and in an easily assimilable state." 

Thousands of letters from all parts of the world assert that users of 
GRAPE-NUTS have thereby been restored to health when other 
foods and drugs have failed to give relief.
