PREFACE 

In presenting these pages to the public, I do so at the earnest 
solicitation of many of my pupils who would have in book form my 
recipes and suggestions. I therefore put into print this pamphlet of 
recipes where the formula is given, followed by the explicit directions 
of how to put together the ingredients ; with such notes and hints as 
may be of value to the housewife. 

The directions are not theories, but the fruits of practical experi- 
ence. The arrangement of the subject-matter is designed to make 
the book a household reference book that may be depended upon. 



Soups 



There are two kinds of soup stock : what is known as clear stock 
and mixed stock. To make a clear soup we always use fresh meat 
and bone ; the mixed stock being made from bones and pieces of 
meat left from roasts and cooked meats. 

As this latter is made from bits of meat and bone left over, no 
household should be without a stock-pot. Into the stock-pot should 
go only such meat and bone as is perfectly sweet, the smallest piece 
of tainted meat will destroy the soup. Stock can be cooked on the 
back of the stove while other cooking is going on. It should be 
cooled quickly and not allowed to stand on the stove to cool slowly. 
Stock allowed to cool slowly becomes sour very readily. 

To prepare soup bone for clear stock remove the outer skin from 
the meat and bone, wipe carefully with a wet cloth. (Do not put 
into a pan of water and wash, as the water draws out the juices, 
which should be kept for the soup.) Have the butcher break the 
bone in many pieces. In buying a soup bone buy half meat and 
half bone. 

AVhite stock is made from chicken and veal. 

Allow one quart of water to each pound of meat and bone. 

CLEAR BEEF STOCK. 

Buy a shin or shank of beef, having half meat and half bone 
(about five pounds) ; remove the skin. Have the butcher break the 
bone and cut the meat into small pieces; add five quarts of cold 
water and two teaspoonfuls of salt; let come to a boil slowly; place 
where it will keep just below the boiling point; simmer slowly for 
six or eight hours, or until the meat falls from the bone; strain and 
cool quickly ; when cold skim off the fat. For beef broth heat the 
plain beef stock, season with salt, pepper and a little minced parsley, 
find serve. This is the simplest form of beef soup. 

BEEF SOUP. 

Strain the soup stock, after removing the fat, into a kettle; do not 
allow the sediment to pass. To four quarts of stock add one small 
onion cut fine, one bay leaf, one stalk of celery, two sprigs of parsley. 
a small bouqut of sweet herbs, ten pepper corns, and six cloves; boil 
gently for fifteen minutes; strain through strainer cloth. Serve as a 
simple beef soup. 



MIXED STOCK. 

Cover with cold water the trimmings, tough pieces of meat and 
bone left from roasts and broils; allow one teaspoonful of salt for 
each quart of water; cook slowly for about four hours; then add 
half an onion, six cloves, six pepper corns, two sprigs of thyme, one 
bay leaf; simmer for two hours longer; strain and cool quickly. 
This stock can be used in sauces or served as a simple soup, gar- 
nished with vegetables or some well-cooked tapioca or sago. 

CHICKEN STOCK. 

Select a hen fowl (not as strong flavored as a rooster) ; singe and 
scrub ; prepare as for roasting, omitting the stuffing ; place in a kettle 
and cover with boiling water ; cook slowly until the fowl is tender ; 
remove from broth, cooling the broth quickly; when cold, remove 
the fat. The chicken may be used for salad, creamed chicken, hash, 
or served as cold boiled chicken.

To one quart of chicken broth add four tablespoonfuls of boiled 
rice and two teaspoonfuls of minced parsley ; heat boiling hot ; sea- 
son with salt and pepper, and serve.

One carrot. 

Cut the meat into small pieces; cover with cold water and add 
the salt; let come to the boiling point slowly; simmer from six to 
eight hours ; add the seasoning and cook one-half-hour longer ; strain 
and cool quickly ; next morning remove the fat ; heat scalding hot ; 
season with salt and pepper and serve. In making bouillon all the 
seasoning except salt and pepper may be omitted if preferred.

add the hot milk and butter; put the crackers into the tureen and 
pour in the chowder; serve very hot. 

FISH CHOWDER. 

Remove the bones from a fresh white fish ; cut the fish into two- 
inch pieces ; cover the bones with water and let simmer for fifteen 
minutes; proceed the same as for clam chowder, using the water in 
which the bones have been boiled instead of the clam juice. 



Fish 

Fish should be perfectly fresh and thoroughly cooked. In buying, 
select only those which have firm flesh, clear eyes and the skin and 
scales bright. If the fish looks limp it is not fit to use. It should be 
washed quickly, and not allowed to stand in the water. A little salt 
in the water keeps the flesh firm. 

Clean the fish as soon as possible, washing it in salt and water ; 
remove the scales by scraping with a small knife, beginning at the 
tail and working towards the head; split it down the middle and 
remove the entrails. 

To skin a fish, cut a thin strip down the backbone, slip the knife 
under the skin at the lower part arid slip it up through the bony part 
of the gills ; hold the bony part and pull the skin off towards the tail ; 
remove it from the other side in the same way. 

TO BONE A FISH. 

Clean the fish ; then take a sharp boning knife, and, beginning at 
the tail, slip the knife between the bone and flesh close to the bone ; 
scrape away the flesh carefully; scrape the flesh away from the 
second set of bones and slip the knife under ; treat the other side in 
the same way, then remove the bone, cutting away the dorsal fin. 

BROILED FISH. 

Clean and bone the fish ; grease the broiler with a piece of salt pork 
to keep the fish from sticking; put fish between the broiler and broil 
over the coals until cooked : the thickness of the fish will determine 
the time. 



14 PEACTICAL COOK BOOK 

TO BROIL IN THE OVEN. 

Clean and bone the fish, grease the fish sheet with salt pork (a fish 
sheet is a piece of sheet iron or tin) ; place the fish, skin down, upon 
the sheet; season it with pepper and salt and brush with melted 
butter; then dust lightly with flour; place on the upper grate of a 
very hot oven and cook from twenty to thirty minutes, according 
to the thickness of the fish ; remove from the sheet and put on a hot 
platter; spread with Maitre d' Hotel sauce, and serve. 

BOILED FISH. 

The general rule for boiled fish is to wash in cold water and wipe 
dry; pin the fish in a piece of strong white cotton cloth to keep it 
from breaking ; cover with boiling water, to which one teaspoonful of 
salt has been added, and cook gently. Rapid boiling will break the 
fish. A fish weighing from four to six pounds will require thirty 
minutes ; allow about three minutes longer for each additional pound. 
For boiled white fish a teaspoonful of lemon juice may be added to 
the water. When the fish is cooked remove from the kettle; drain 
well ; serve on a hot platter garnished with sprigs of parsley. Serve 
boiled fish with Hollandaise sauce, drawn butter, or egg sauce. 

BAKED FISH. 

Scrape and wash the fish ; for a fish weighing four to six pounds 
take three cupfuls of stale bread crumbs, moisten them with three 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter; add one teaspoonful of salt, one- 
fourth teaspoonful of pepper, one tablespoonful of minced parsley 
and one egg beaten light ; rub the fish with salt and pepper ; put the 
stuffing into the body of the fish and fasten together with skewers ; 
butter the fish sheet and place the fish upon it, putting it into a bak- 
ing pan ; dredge with pepper, salt and flour ; cover the bottom of the 
pan with hot water ; bake in a hot oven about one hour, basting every 
fifteen minutes ; when cooked, remove the sheet from the pan and 
slip the fish off carefully into a hot platter; pour around it tomato 
or Hollandaise sauce; garnish with lemon points and sprigs of 
parsley. 

FRIED FISH. 

Fish to be fried should be cleaned, washed and dried ; rub with salt 
and pepper; roll in flour and cornmeal (half of each) ; then dip in 
beaten egg (add one tablespoonful of water to each egg), and roll in 
dry bread crumbs ; fry in very hot fat ; serve very hot, with Beurre 
Noir poured over it, or serve with sauce tartare. 

Any kind of fish can be fried in the same way, cutting large fish 
into serving pieces. 

Note. For temperature of fat see article "Fat for Frying."

pepper, and when slightly cooled add the egg and more salt if 
needed ; shape in a tablespoon ; fry in hot fat until a golden brown ; 
use a frying basket and fry only four or five at a time ; more will cool 
the fat. The fat should be hot enough to brown a piece of raw 
potato in forty seconds. Drain on soft paper and serve immediately. 

FISH SOUFFLE. 

Prepare the fish as for fish balls ; add one-fourth of a cup of cream 
and two eggs beaten separately. Bake in a moderate oven about

hot cream slowly to the butter and flour; season with salt and 
pepper; add the cooked oysters, and serve. 

OYSTERS A LA POULETTE. 

Cook one quart of oysters in their own liquor until they boil; 
when they begin to boil, strain; cook together one tablespoonful 
of butter and one tablespoonful of flour; add one cup to the oyster 
liquid and stir until a smooth sauce is formed ; add one pint of 
cream, one level teaspoonful of salt, one-half saltspoonful of white 
pepper, dash of cayenne pepper and a slight grating of nutmeg; 
beat the yolks of four eggs; add one-half cup of cold cream; add 
the oysters to the cooking mixture and then the beaten yolks of the 
eggs; cook two or three minutes, stirring all the time; serve im- 
mediately with puff paste cakes or crackers. If liked, a tablespoonful 
of lemon juice may be added just as the oysters are taken from the 
fire. 

ESCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

Moisten stale bread crumbs with melted butter, and season with 
salt and pepper ; butter the baking dish ; put a layer of bread crumbs 
in the bottom and then a layer of oysters, another layer of crumbs 
and another layer of oysters; cover the whole with the crumbs and 
bake in a moderate oven about twenty minutes, or until the crumbs 
are nicely browned. 

Note. For escalloped oysters a shallow dish or platter should be 
used, ^allowing only two layers of oysters to each dish. If more are 
used the upper and under layers will be overcooked while the inner 
ones may be underdone. 



All fresh meats to be boiled should be plunged into boiling water 
and allowed to boil rapidly for ten or fifteen minutes, to coagulate 
the albumen and thus close the pores, keeping in the juices of the 
meat. After the meat has boiled for ten minutes place it where it 
will just simmer, until tender. Meat that boils rapidly will be 
stringy. 

HAM. 

Scrub a ham with a brush until perfectly clean ; then place it in 
a large kettle with cold water and let it come to the boiling point ; 
simmer gently until tender it requires about twenty minutes to

the pound let it stand in the water until cold, then remove the skin ; 
roll in fine bread crumbs ; stick the fat parts with whole cloves and 
bake in a moderate oven about half an hour. 

TONGUE. 

Cook slowly in boiling water until tender about five or six hours 
then plunge into cold water and peel off the skin. For salt tongue, 
soak over night and cover with cold water instead of boiling water 
when putting on to cook. 

CORNED BEEF. 

Wash and cover with cold water ; simmer slowly five or six hours, 
or until tender ; let stand in the water in which it was boiled if it is 
to be served cold. To press corned beef, remove the bones after it is 
cooked and put it under a heavy weight. 

NEW ENGLAND DINNER. 

Six pounds of corned beef, One small white turnip, 

One pound of salt pork, One small yellow turnip, 

Two or three beets, Six or eight medium-sized pota- 

Two carrots, toes of uniform size. 

One head of cabbage, 

Wash and soak the corned beef and pork in cold water ; put it on 
to boil in fresh cold water; simmer until it is tender; remove from 
the kettle and skim the liquor ; wash and pare the turnips and carrots 
and cut into inch slices ; cut the cabbage into quarters and wash care- 
fully; put the carrots, turnips and cabbage into the boiling liquor 
and cook until tender ; pare and add the potatoes half an hour before 
serving time ; cook the beets in a separate kettle ; remove the skin, 
cut in half-inch slices; when the vegetables are cooked, drain; put 
the beef and pork in the center of a large platter ; serve the carrots, 
potatoes and turnips around the edge, with the cabbage and beets 
in separate dishes; the beets can be cooked the day before and 
covered with vinegar, serving them as pickled beets ; always cook 
the beets in a separate kettle ; the corned beef may be cooked the day 
before and pressed, saving the liquor for cooking the vegetables. 



Stewing 

CHICKEN STEW. 

Singe, draw, wash and cut the chicken, at the joints, into serving 
pieces; cover with boiling water; add one teaspoonful of salt and 
half a saltspoonful of pepper; simmer until tender; remove all the 
large bones and put the chicken, on toast, on a large platter; cook 



20 PEACTICA'L COOK BOOK 

together one tablespoonful of butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour ; 
add one and one-half cupfuls of cold milk and stir until smooth ; 
add the chicken broth gradually; season with pepper and salt arid 
celery salt ; pour the hot sauce over the chicken and toast, and serve. 
If you wish to serve dumplings with the chicken stew, ten minutes 
before the chicken is cooked let the liquid boil up. then put in the 
dumplings. When serving dumplings omit the toast. 

CHICKEN FRICASSEE. 

Cut the chicken as for stew; brown in hot butter before stewing: 
make a brown gravy by browning the butter before adding the 
gravy; serve on toast. 

LAMB FRICASSEE. 

Two pounds breast of lamb or One onion, 
mutton, 

Cut the lamb in small pieces ; dredge with salt and flour and brown 
in drippings ; cut the onion fine and brown in fat ; add to the meat : 
put in a stewpan and cover with boiling water; simmer until the 
bones slip out ; remove the bones ; strain the liquor and skim off the 
fat ; when the liquor boils again add the meat, pepper and salt ; then 
add one quart of green peas or one pint of cooked rice, and simmer 
fifteen minutes. 

VEAL STEW. 

Cut the veal into small pieces ; cover with boiling water ; add one- 
half teaspoonful of salt and one small onion, browned ; simmer until 
veal is tender; add four potatoes, cut in thick slices; cook together 
one tablespoonful of butter and two of flour ; add one cupful of cold 
milk ; stir until smooth ; add the veal broth gradually ; remove bones 
from veal and simmer all together for five minutes, then serve. 

Beef and mutton stew are made in the same way. 

For stewing, the cheapest and toughest meat is used ; by long, slow 
cooking it becomes tender. 

CURRY OF RABBIT. 

Cut the rabbit into serving pieces; brown in hot butter; remove 
from the butter and put into stew kettle ; add one large onion, cut 
into slices; cook one tablespoonful of flour and one of curry powder 
in the butter in which the rabbit was browned : add one cupful of 
water or stock and stir until thickened; then add one cupful of 
strained tomatoes, one teaspoonful of sugar and pepper and salt 
to taste: pour this over the rabbit and stew until tender: add a 
cupful of milk ; heat boiling hot ; serve with boiled rice. 



Broiling 



Broiling is the most perfect way of cooking meat and fish. There 
are three ways of broiling, what is known as broiling proper, pan 
broiling and oven broiling. 

Broiling proper is to broil directly over the coals ; the fire must be 
hot, clear and free from smoke. For meat it must be hotter than for 
fish. Pan broiling is cooking upon a smoking hot griddle. Oven 
broiling is cooking in a very hot oven. The most delicious results are 
obtained by broiling steaks, chops, young chickens, squab, etc., 
directly over the glowing coals. Charcoal is best for broiling, but 
hard wood, coal or gas may be used, provided it is free from 
smoke. The point to be remembered in broiling is to have the fire, 
griddle or oven hot enough to instantly sear the outer surface of the 
meat. 

The best cuts of steak make the most delicious broils, tenderness 
being one of the essential qualities. It must be remembered, how- 
ever, that a second-class cut of steak taken from a first-class bullock 
will make a much better broil than a first class cut taken from a 
second-class beef. When selecting beef see that it has a thick rim 
of fat. that the lean is well marbled with fat and is of a bright red 
color after being exposed to the air for a short time. 

STEAKS. 

Have steak cut thick two inches is the proper thickness for a 
steak; it should never be cut less than one inch. Trim off the suet; 
put between a double broiler and place it as close to the coals as 
possible ; allow it to cook for about a minute, or until the under side 
is well seared, then turn and sear the other side ; remove a little dis- 
tance from the coals and cook from fifteen to twenty minutes, turn- 
ing constantly. A steak that is broiled perfectly should be puffed out 
in the center and should be of a delicate pink color throughout. 
Serve immediately on a warm platter ; garnish with sprigs of parsley 
or watercress. 

PAN BROILING. 

To pan broil a steak, have the griddle smoking hot ; rub with fat ; 
place the steak on the griddle and press close ; let it cook one minute ; 
then, with a knife, loosen from the griddle and turn ; sear the other 
side ; reduce the heat slightly and cook from fifteen to twenty min- 
utes, turning very frequently ; do not prick the steak with a fork or 



22 PRACTICAL COOK BOOK 

the juice will escape. The steak can be easily turned with two 
knives by slipping one under the steak and assisting to turn with the 
other. Broiled steak is served as soon as taken from the fire, sea- 
soned with pepper and salt. Maitre d' Hotel sauce is sometimes 
served with broiled steak. 

TIME FOR BROILING STEAKS. 

Steak two inches in thickness requires from fifteen to twenty 
minutes; one and one-half inches, from twelve to fifteen minutes; 
and one inch, from eight to ten minutes. 

LAMB AND MUTTON CHOPS. 

Remove the outer skin and all the suet from the chops ; broil over 
the coals or on a hot griddle ; serve with tomato sauce and season 
with salt and pepper ; garnish with parsley. 

Note. Before cooking lamb or mutton always remove the skin. 
It is in the skin that the disagreeable flavor exists. 

BROILED CHICKEN. 

Only very young chickens should be broiled. Singe and draw the 
chickens, picking out all pin-feathers; split down the back; clean 
and wipe with wet towel ; break the joints ; sprinkle with salt and 
pepper; grease a double broiler; turn the inside of the chicken to 
the fire first ; turn frequently, being careful the fire is not too hot ; 
broil about twenty minutes, or until the bird is tender and nicely 
browned ; spread with softened butter and serve on a warm plate ; 
garnish with parsley or watercress. 



Roasting 



Roasting and baking are now synonymous terms. We speak of 
roasting meats and baking breads, yet we use the same oven for both. 
Roasting formerly meant to place the meat on a spit before the open 
fire, turn it frequently and baste constantly to keep from burning. 
Roasting to-day means to bake in a hot oven. 

ROAST BEEF. 

There are seven prime ribs in a beef. Any of them will make a 
first-class roast. Do not have the ribs removed, but have them cut 
in two-inch pieces up to the thick muscle ; cut these pieces of bone 
off, to be braised and served as short ribs of beef ; place the cut sur- 
face of the roast on a smoking hot griddle and press close; let cook for 



BOASTING 23 

two or three minutes, or until it is nicely seared ; turn and sear the 
other side ; set the roast, resting upon the edges of the ribs, on a rack 
in a dripping pan ; put into an oven hot enough to bake bread, and let 
cook ; do not season the meat and do not put water in the pan; when 
the oven is at the proper temperature you will hear a gentle sputter- 
ing f .when the oven door is opened if smoke issues from the oven it 
is too hot if you do not hear a gentle sputtering increase the tem- 
perature. The time required for roasting depends upon the thickness 
of the roast ; fifteen minutes is allowed for each inch in thickness ; a 
roast four inches in thickness will cook rare in one hour; measure 
across the thickest part of a roast. A rump roast is seared in the 
same way and placed upon a rack in a hot oven ; allow fifteen min- 
utes to the pound. 

YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

Two-thirds of a cupful of flour, One pint of milk, 
Three eggs, One teaspoonful of salt. 

Sift the flour and measure ; add the salt ; separate the eggs and add 
the yolks, unbeaten, to the flour ; add a little of the milk and mix to 
a smooth paste ; add the rest of the milk gradually ; beat whites of 
the eggs to a stiff froth and stir into the batter ; pour into the roast- 
ing pan forty-five minutes before the roast is cooked ; serve hot with 
the roast of beef; if the roast is very fat pour some of the fat from 
the pan before putting in the pudding. 

BRAISED BEEF OR POT ROAST. 

Six or eight pounds chuck roast or a piece of the rump ; trim and 
rub with pepper and salt ; cut a large onion into dice and brown in 
salt pork fat ; put the roast into a braising pan ; pour over it one 
quart of boiling water; add the onion; cover closely and cook in a 
moderate oven about four hours, turning after two hours, and add 
more water as it evaporates, so as to have three cups of gravy ; when 
tender take up the meat; skim off the fat from the gravy and thicken 
with a tablespoonful or flour wet in a little cold water and strained 
into the gravy ; season with pepper and salt and a little lemon juice. 

VEAL HEART. 

Remove the tough membranes and soak in cold water and salt one 
hour ; wipe and stuff with stale bread crumbs seasoned with salt and 
pepper and moistened with melted butter; rub the heart with salt, 
pepper and dredge with flour; fry brown in a pan with a little fat 
salt pork ; place in braising kettle ; add one pint of water, one tea- 
spoonful of minced onion ; sprig of parsley, three cloves, three pepper 
corns, one small carrot cut fine ; cover tightly and cook two hours in 
a moderately hot oven ; turn three or four times while cooking. 



24 PRACTICAL COOK BOOK 

ROAST LAMB OR MUTTON. 

Remove the skin from a leg of lamb or mutton; sear the cut sur- 
faces on a hot griddle ; place on a rack in a roasting pan in a hot 
oven. A leg of lamb will roast in one hour and a quarter, while it 
requires one hour and three-quarters to roast a medium-sized leg 
of mutton. 

ROAST VEAL. 

Veal being a dry meat, requires basting to keep it moist and to 
enrichen it; rub the veal with sugar, salt and pepper, using one-half 
as much sugar as salt ; place upon rack in roasting pan and let cook 
in a hot oven until nicely browned, then baste with a thin gravy 
made from one tablespoonful of butter, one of flour and two cupfuls 
of stock or water; season with pepper and salt; baste every fifteen 
minutes ; veal requires longer cooking than either beef or mutton ; 
a five-pound roast will cook in two and one-half hours. 

PORK. 

Fresh pork is seasoned with pepper, salt and sugar. Roast and 
baste the same as veal. 



Poultry and Game 



TO DRAW POULTRY. 

All poultry should be dressed as soon as killed; the feathers come 
out more easily while the fowl is warm; strip them off toward the 
head ; remove the pin-feathers with a knife ; singe the hairs by hold- 
ing it over the gas jet or a piece of lighted paper ; cut off the head ; 
turn the skin back and cut off the neck close to the body ; remove 
the windpipe and crop ; to remove the feet, cut the skin just below 
the leg joint; break the joint; with a skewer pull out the tendons; 
cut away the oil bag in the tail ; make an incision under the side bone 
near the tail large enough to insert two fingers; slip the fingers 
around the entrails; separating the membrane; when everything is 
loosened, get the fingers around the heart and pull out the entrails ; 
then take out the lungs and kidneys; when everything is removed 
hold the fowl under the faucet and rinse well, then wipe dry. 

TO CLEAN GIBLETS. 

Remove the outside sack from the heart ; cut open and press out 
the clot of blood ; cut off the gall bladder from the liver, being care- 
ful not to break it, and cut away any discolored part of the liver; 



POULTRY AND GAME 25 

open the thick part of the gizzard and take out the inner sack with- 
out breaking; wash giblets and put into cold water; simmer until 
tender ; cook the neck with the giblets. 

TO TRUSS POULTRY. 

Draw the thighs up close to the body and pass a skewer through 
the thigh and into the body and out through the other thigh; pass 
another skewer through the wings, fastening them close to the 
body ; fold the skin at the neck over and pin it to the back with a 
skewer; cross the legs over the tail and tie with a stout twine, leav- 
ing two long ends ; pass the twine around the tail, bring it up, cross- 
ing in front and passing around the skewer in the thighs; cross in 
the back and fasten around the skewer through the wings and tie 
firmly. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

Singe, draw, wash and wipe ; stuff the body and neck with stale 
bread crumbs moistened with melted butter and seasoned with 
pepper, salt and celery salt; truss and rub with butter; lay the 
turkey, breast down, on the rack in the roasting pan ; put into a hot 
oven and cook until the back of the turkey is nicely browned, then 
turn it over and brown breast; pour one pint of water into the pan 
after the turkey is browned; baste every fifteen minutes, or when- 
ever the skin becomes very dry ; allow about twenty -five minutes to 
the pound for roasting; if the turkey browns too rapidly cover the 
breast with a heavy paper well buttered. Oysters or chopped celery 
may be added to the stuffing if desired. 

ROAST CHICKEN. 

Prepare the same as roast turkey ; allow twenty minutes to the 
pound for roasting. 

ROAST DUCK. 

Many people prefer young ducks served rare ; when so liked, they 
are not stuffed. 

Pick, singe, draw and wash the duck; wipe, truss and dredge with 
salt, pepper and Hour; roast in a hot oven about thirty minutes. 
Full-grown domestic ducks should be roasted about one hour and 
basted every ten minutes. Make a giblet gravy and serve with a 
grape or currant jelly. 

Ducks and geese have a strong flavor, and are improved by stuff- 
ing the body with apples or onions or coarse bits of celery, which 
absorb the flavor and should not be eaten. 



26 PRACTICAL COOK BOOK 

ROAST WILD DUCK. 

Nearly all wild ducks have a strong or fishy flavor. To lessen 
this flavor put an onion cut in two into the body of the bird, and let 
stand some hours before cooking. 

Clean the same as poultry and wipe both inside and out with a 
damp towel ; tuck back the wings and truss the legs close to the 
body ; rub with salt, pepper, butter and flour ; place in a baking pan 
and add one cup of boiling water; roast twenty-five to thirty-five 
minutes in a hot oven, basting occasionally with butter; serve very 
hot, with slices of lemon or currant jelly. 



Frying 



Frying is cooking in hot fat deep enough to entirely cover the 
articles to be cooked. When food is properly fried the fat is hot 
enough to instantly sear the outer surface and thus prevent it soak- 
ing into the food. All food to be fried should be thoroughly dried ; 
if water should drop into the hot fat it would cause the fat to boil 
over, and there is danger of it taking fire and causing great trouble. 
Pood that does not contain sufficient albumen to form a coating on 
the outside as soon as immersed into the hot fat should be rolled in 
crumbs, then in egg and again in crumbs to form a grease-proof 
covering. A frying-basket, or a wire basket with a long handle, is 
very convenient for frying purposes. In many cook books we read, 
''heat the fat smoking hot." That depends entirely upon the kind 
of fat you are using ; lard will smoke at a much lower temperature 
than oil. When fat smokes it loses some of its browning properties ; 
never let fat heat without putting a small piece of raw potato into 
it. As soon as the potato begins to brown drop in a fresh piece of 
potato ; if it browns in one minute the fat is hot enough to fry 
potatoes and dough mixtures. For such food as we roll in bread 
crumbs and egg the fat should be hot enough to brown a bit of bread 
in forty seconds. 

The best fat for frying purposes is a mixture of beef suet and oil, 
as both these fats can be heated to a much higher temperature with- 
out smoking than lard. Olive oil is the purest fat for frying, but is 
too expensive for general use. 

For frying the same fat can be used several times if properly cared 
for. The most delicate croquettes can be fried in the same fat with 
fish and not be marred in flavor. When frying several different 
kinds of food at the same time, begin with potatoes, then dough mix- 
tures and lastlv articles rolled in crumbs. 



FRYING 27 

When finished with the fat drop three or four slices of raw potato 
into it ; cool slightly, and strain through a fine strainer or a strainer 
cloth. 

FRENCH FRIED POTATOES. 

Pare the potatoes and cut in strips one-half inch in thickness; let 
stand in cold water one hour; heat the fat hot enough to brown a 
thin slice of potato in one minute ; wipe the potatoes ; put into the 
frying basket and lower into the hot fat ; do not put a large quantity 
of potatoes in at one time, as they will lower the temperature of the 
fat and the potatoes will be soggy and greasy. When the potatoes 
are nicely browned lift from the fat and shake free from grease; 
turn onto a piece of cheese cloth to absorb the fat ; dust lightly with 
salt, and serve immediately. French fried potatoes should be crisp 
and mealy. If they stand they become soggy. 

SARATOGA CHIPS. 

Pare the potatoes and slice very thin ; let them stand in cold water 
two or three hours ; wipe dry ; fry in fat hot enough to brown in one 
minute ; when nicely browned remove the basket and shake well ; 
turn chips onto cheese cloth or soft paper ; dust well with salt. 

LAMB CHOPS BREADED. 

Trim the chops and remove the skin ; season with salt and pepper ; 
roll in fine bread crumbs ; dip in beaten egg and roll again in bread 
crumbs ; fry in hot fat. For a chop one inch in thickness it will re- 
quire six minutes to cook rare and from eight to ten to cook well 
done. 

Note. One tablespoonful of water added to beaten egg makes a 
more elastic coating for fried food. 

FRIED CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicken into ten pieces ; season with pepper and salt ; roll 

in fine bread crumbs; dip in beaten egg; roll in crumbs, and fry in 

fat hot enough to brown a piece of bread in one minute. A young 

chicken will cook in ten minutes. Serve with sauce tartare or cream 

-sauce; garnish the dish with sprigs of parsley. 

Note. For fried fish, see article on Fish. 

CROQUETTES. 

In making croquettes the material must be chopped fine, well 
mixed, and seasoned delicately. The shaping of croquettes can 
readily be acquired by a little practice and care. They are formed 
into cone, ball and cylindrical shapes. 



9g PRACTICAL COOK BOOK 

To Shape. Take a tablespoonful of the mixture, roll gently be- 
tween the hands into a ball; have a board well sprinkled with fine 
dry bread crumbs and roll the croquette very gently on this into 
shape ; dip into beaten egg, to which one tablespoonful of water has 
been added; water added to the egg makes a more elastic coating 
than egg alone ; after dipping the croquette into the egg roll it again 
in the bread crumbs and then fry in fat hot enough to brown a piece 
of bread in forty seconds ; cook until nicely browned it will re- 
quire about two minutes; shake free from fat and lay on cheese 
cloth or soft brown paper.

add the butter, mix the ginger and nutmeg with the flour and add 
enough to make a soft dough ; let stand over night, or several hours, 
before frying ; roll a piece of the dough into a sheet half an inch in 
thickness ; cut into shape and fry in deep fat ; cut all the doughnuts 
before frying, as the frying will require your full attention ; the fat 
should be hot enough to brown a piece of potato in one minute. 



Sauteing is cooking food in a small quantity of fat. Butter, when 
clarified, is the most satisfactory for some things, as it browns nicely 
and gives a delicious flavor to the food, but lard or drippings may be 
used. 

CLARIFIED BUTTER. 

To clarify butter, let it boil gently for about a minute the salt 
will settle to the bottom; the scum which rises to the top should be 
skimmed off, leaving the oil clear. 

MUSH. 

Cut cold mush into thin slices; cook on a griddle buttered with 
clarified butter until nicely browned. 

FRIED APPLES. 

Cut tart apples in thin slices; dust lightly with flour, and fry in 
clarified butter until nicely browned; serve with liver, breakfast 
bacon or pork chops. 

VEAL CUTLETS. 

Rub the chops with salt, sugar and pepper ; dredge with flour ; heat 
one tablespoonful of clarified butter or drippings in the spider; 
brown the chops nicely on both sides; add two tablespoonfuls of 



32 PRACTICAL COOK BOOK 

water ; cover the spider closely and let simmer ten minutes ; serve on 
a hot platter; add one-fourth of a cupful of sweet milk to the gravy 
in the spider, and serve with the chops. 

PORK CHOPS. 

Season and cook the same as veal cutlets ; veal and pork require 
long and thorough cooking. 

HAMBURG STEAKS. 

One pound of round steak chopped very fine ; one tablespoonful of 
minced onion ; pepper and salt to taste ; mix the meat and seasonings 
thoroughly together ; shape into cakes about three-fourths of an inch 
in thickness ; grease the griddle or spider well ; brown nicely on both 
sides ; cook about five minutes, and serve. 

CALF'S LIVER. 

Cut in slices one-half inch in thickness ; dust with pepper and salt 
and roll in flour ; cook in bacon fat until nicely browned ; serve with 
breakfast bacon or fried apples, or cover the liver with boiling water 
and let stand five minutes ; season with pepper and salt ; roll in flour 
and frv in bacon fat or clarified butter. 



Salads 

Salads, to be palatable, should always be crisp and fresh and 
served icy cold. It is upon its crispness and the proper mingling and 
selection of ingredients that its success depends; when lettuce is to 
be used it must be washed carefully, taking care not to break the 
leaves. The large dark leaves are not nice for salad. Of celery only 
the white crisp parts are used, the green, tough parts being utilized 
for soups and stews. All fresh vegetables to be used for salads 
should stand in ice water until just before serving time. Vegetable 
salads are served after the meat course at dinner a rich salad, such 
as lobster, chicken, sweetbread, etc., is out of place at a heavy meal. 
These latter are best served at lunches or suppers. In arranging a 
salad on a dish or in a bowl, handle it very gently; do not press it 
into form. The garnishings should be of the freshest and crispest 
kind.

Vegetables 



All green vegetables must be cooked in freshly boiled salted water ; 
allow one teaspoonful of salt for each quart of water. The younger 
the vegetable the more quickly it will cook. 

POTATOES. 

Nearly every housekeeper fancied she can cook a potato, and yet 
we have so many soggy and poor-flavored potatoes brought to our 
tables. The potato is composed chiefly of starch and water. When 
subjected to heat the starch cells burst and the potato becomes ten- 
der. If removed from the water or oven as soon as the starch is set 
free the potato will be mealy and dry, but if allowed to cook longer 
the starch will absorb the moisture and the potato be soggy. 

BOILED POTATOES. 

If cooking new potatoes, boil them in their jackets; old potatoes, 
scrub, pare and let stand in cold water two or three hours to freshen 
them; cover with boiling water, to which a teaspoonful of salt has 
been added, and boil gently from twenty to thirty minutes ; medium- 
sized potatoes will require thirty minutes; rapid boiling will break 
the potatoes; when cooked drain off every drop of water; remove 
the cover and shake the saucepan over the fire until the potatoes 
are dry and mealy; serve immediately. The potatoes should be put 
on to boil just one-half hour before they are to be served. If they 
must stand, set the saucepan on the back part of the stove and cover 
with a towel until serving time. The towel will absorb the moisture. 



VEGETABLES 41

hot milk over the potatoes and beat until light and creamy ; pile on 
a hot dish; do not smooth the mound, but leave it irregular; serve 
immediately. 

RICED POTATOES. 

Prepare the potatoes as for mashed potatoes; press through a 
potato-ricer into a hot dish ; put the dish in the oven for five minutes. 

BAKED POTATOES. 

Select potatoes of uniform size ; scrub and remove any imperfec- 
tions in the skin ; wipe dry and put into a hot oven ; bake about forty- 
five minutes, or until the potato feels soft when pressed between the

the potato gently ; remove immediately from the oven ; cover with a 
towel until serving time; send baked potatoes to the table covered 
with a doily to protect them from the cold air.

half an hour before the meat is cooked ; arrange on the dish with the 
beef.

Shcrbcrts and Ice Cream 

DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING. 

Pour the mixture into the tin can ; put the beater in and put on the 
cover ; put the can into the tub and see that the point on the bottom 
of the can fits into the socket in the tub ; put on the crosspiece and 
turn to see if everything is in place; break the ice very fine; put a 
layer of about four inches in the bottom of the tub, and then a layer 
of salt, using about three times as much ice as salt ; put on another 
layer of ice and one of salt, and continue until the tub is full : turn 
the crank slowly until the cream begins to harden, then turn rapidly 
for about ten minutes. It will be hard to turn when the mixture is 
frozen ; wipe the salt and water from the cover ; turn back the cross- 
piece and take off the cover without displacing the can ; remove the 
beater and scrape the cream from it ; pack the cream down ; put on 
the cover and cork the hole ; put on the crosspiece and pack the ice 
tightly, adding more ice and salt; let stand two or three hours to 
ripen. To mould cream, fill the mould, pressing the cream into 
every corner ; cover, seal by wrapping a piece of muslin, dipped in 
softened fat. around the mould where the cover and mould join; 
pack in ice and salt for an hour; cover the bucket with an old rug 
or piece of carpet. This will prevent the ice melting rapidly.

of water and lemon juice and freeze. 

FRAPPE. 

Freeze a fruit ice to a mush and serve in sherbet glasses. 



Beverages 

COFFEE. 

Mocha and Java coffee are supposed to make the best mixture. 
The best grade, however, should be bought. It should always be 
ground just before using and never bought ground, as it quickly 
loses its flavor, even if kept in air-tight tins. 

Coffee should not be boiled longer than one or two minutes ; when 
coffee is boiled for a long time we lose from our beverage the deli- 
cious aroma which permeates the room, leaving the coffee bitter. 
Allow one tablespoonful of coffee for each cupful, and one for the 
pot. 

Five tablespoonfuls of finely One egg white, or two egg shells, 

ground coffee, Two cupfuls of boiling water. 

Two cupfuls of cold water, 



BEVERAGES 75 

Have the coffee ground medium (not too fine) ; mix the dry 
coffee with the egg white ; add the cold water and mix thoroughly ; 
let come to the boiling point, slowly ; boil one or two minutes ; then 
add the boiling water and set on the back part of the stove where it 
will keep hot, but will not boil, for fifteen or twenty minutes ; serve 
with hot milk and cream. Do not boil, simply scald the milk ; boiled 
milk gives an unpleasant flavor. The egg is used to clear the coffee. 

* 

VIENNA COFFEE. 

To one-fourth of a cupful of hot milk add two tablespoonfuls of 
whipped cream ; fill the cup with hot coffee. 

CHOCOLATE. 

Scrape fine an ounce and a half of chocolate ; put into a saucepan 
with one cupful of water ; cook until smooth ; add to it three cupfuls 
of scalding hot milk ; mix thoroughly and serve with whipped cream. 
If unsweetened chocolate is used add two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

TEA. 

In making tea an earthern teapot is best ; fill the teapot with boil- 
ing water and let stand five minutes; empty, and put in the tea; 
allowing one teaspoonful for each cup; cover with freshly boiled 
water and allow it to stand on the stove where it will keep hot, but 
will not boil, for five minutes ; or put in a cosy. 

LEMONADE. 

Juice of three and grated rind Half a cupful of sugar, 
of one large lemon, Four cupfuls of water. 

Cook the sugar and grated rind of the lemon in half a cupful of 
water for five minutes ; let cool squeeze the lemons ; add the syrup 
and the remainder of the water ; strain and serve ice cold.

PREFACE 

In presenting- these pages to the public, I do so at the earnest 
solicitation of many of my pupils who would have in book form my 
recipes and suggestions. I therefore put into print this pamphlet of 
recipes where the formula is given, followed by the explicit directions 
of how to put together the ingredients: with such notes and hints as 
may be of value to the housewife. 

The directions are not theories, but the fruits of practical experi- 
ence. The arrangement of the subject-matter is designed to make 
the book a household reference book that may be depended upon. 



Soups 



There are two kinds of soup stock: what is known as clear stock 
and mixed stock. To make a clear soup we always use fresh meat 
and bone; the mixed stock being made from bones and pieces of 
meat left from roasts and cooked meats. 

As this latter is made from bits of meat and bone left over, no 
household should be without a stock-pot. Into the stock-pot should 
go only such meat and bone as is perfectly sweet, the smallest piece 
of tainted meat will destroy the soup. Stock can be cooked on the 
back of the stove while other cooking 1 is going on. It should be 
cooled quickly and not allow T ed to stand on the stove to cool slowly. 
Stock allowed to cool slowly becomes sour very readily. 

To prepare soup bone for clear stock remove the outer skin from 
the meat and bone, wipe carefully with a Avet cloth. (Do not put 
into a pan of water and wash, as the water draws out the juices, 
which should be kept for the soup.) Have the butcher break the 
bone in many pieces. In buying a soup bone buy half meat and 
half bone. 

White stock is made from chicken and veal. 

Allow on<' quart of water to each pound of meat and hone. 

CLEAR BEEF STOCK. 

Buy a shin or shank of beef, having half meat and half bone 
(about five pounds) : remove the skin. Have the butcher break the 
bone and cut the meat into small pieces; add five quarts of cold 
water and two teaspoonfuls of salt ; let come to a boil slowly ; place 
where it will keep just below the boiling point; simmer slowly for 
six or eight hours, or until the meat falls from the bone; strain and 
cool quickly; when cold skim off the fat. For beef broth heat the 
plain beef stock, season with salt, pepper and a little minced parsley, 
and serve. This is the simplest form of beef soup. 

BEEF SOUP. 

Strain the soup stock, after removing the fat, into a kettle; do not 
allow the sediment to pass. To four quarts of stock add one small 
onion cut fine, one bay leaf, one stalk of celery, two sprigs of parsley, 
a small bouqut of sweet herbs, ten pepper corns, and six cloves; boil 
gently for fifteen minutes; strain through strainer cloth. Serve as a 
simple beef soup. 



g PRACTICAL COOK BOOK 

MIXED STOCK. 

Cover with cold water the trimmings, tough pieces of meat and 
bone left from roasts and broils ; allow one teaspoonful of salt for 
each quart of water; cook slowly for about four hours: then add 
half an onion, six cloves, six pepper corns, two sprigs of thyme, one 
bay leaf; simmer for two hours longer: strain and cool quickly. 
This stock can be used in sauces or served as a simple soup, gar- 
nished with vegetables or some well-cooked tapioca or sago. 

CHICKEN STOCK. 

Select a hen fowl (not as strong flavored as a rooster) ; singe and 
scrub ; prepare as for roasting, omitting the stuffing : place in a kettle 
and cover with boiling water; cook slowly until the fowl is tender; 
remove from broth, cooling the broth quickly: when cold, remove 
the fat. The chicken may be used for salad, creamed chicken, hash, 
or served as cold boiled chicken. 

CHICKEN BROTH. 

To one quart of chicken broth add four tablespoonfuls of boiled 
rice and two teaspoonfuls of minced parsley: heat boiling hoi ; sea- 
son with salt and pepper, and serve

One level teaspoonful of salt. Four cloves and four pepper corns. 
One carrot. 

Cut the meat into small pieces; cover with cold water and add 
the salt: let come to the boiling point slowly: simmer from six to 
eight hours: add the seasoning and cook one-half-hour longer; strain 
and cool quickly: next morning remove the fat: heat scalding hot: 
season with salt and pepper and serve. In making bouillon all the 
seasoning except salt and pepper may be omitted if preferred.

potatoes and cook fifteen minutes ; season with salt and pepper.

Fish 

Fish should be perfectly fresh and thoroughly cooked. In buy i tig, 
select only those which have firm flesh, clear eyes and the skin and 
scales bright. If the fish looks limp it is not fit to use. It should be 
washed quickly, and not allowed to stand in the water. A little salt 
in the water keeps the flesh firm. 

Clean the fish as soon as possible, washing it in salt and water; 
remove the scales by scraping with a small knife, beginning at the 
tail and working towards the head: split it down the middle and 
remove the entrails. 

To skin a fish, cut a thin strip down the backbone, slip the knife 
under the skin at the lower part and slip it up through the bony part 
of the gills; hold the bony part and pull the skin off towards the tail ; 
remove it from the other side in the same way. 

TO BONE A FISH. 

Clean the fish; then take a sharp boning knife, and. beginning at 
the tail, slip the knife between the bone and flesh close to the bone; 
scrape away the flesh carefully ; scrape the flesh away from the 
second set of bones and slip the knife under; treat the other side in 
the same way, then remove the bone, cutting away the dorsal fin. 

BROILED FISH. 

Clean and bone the fish ; grease the broiler with a piece of salt pork 
to keep the fish from sticking; put fish between the broiler and broil 
over the coals until cooked ; the thickness of the fish will determine 
the time. 



j4 PEACTICAL COOK BOOK 

TO BROIL IN THE OVEN. 

Clean and bone the fish, grease the fish sheet with salt pork (a fish 
sheet is a piece of sheet iron or tin) ; place the fish, skin down, upon 
the sheet; season it with pepper and salt and brush with melted 
butter; then dust lightly with flour; place on the upper grate of a 
very hot oven and cook from twenty to thirty minutes, according 
to the thickness of the fish ; remove from the sheet and put on a hot 
platter; spread with Maitre d' Hotel sauce, and serve. 

BOILED FISH. 

The general rule for boiled fish is to wash in cold water and wipe 
dry; pin the fish in a piece of strong while cotton cloth to keep it 
from breaking; cover with boiling water, to which one teaspoonful of 
salt has been added, and cook gently. Rapid boiling will break the 
fish. A fish weighing from four to six pounds will require thirty 
minutes; allow about three minutes longer for cadi additional pound. 
For boiled white fish a teaspoonful of lemon juice may be added to 
the water. When the fish is cooked remove from the kettle; drain 
well; serve on a hot platter garnished with sprigs of parsley. Serve 
boiled fish with Hollandaise sauce, drawn butter, or egg sauce. 

BAKED FISH.

take three cupfuls of stale bread crumbs, moisten them with three 
tablespoonfuls of melted butter; add one teaspoonful of salt, one- 
fourth teaspoonful of pepper, one tablespoonful of minced parsley 
and one egg beaten light; rub the fish with salt and pepper; put the 
stuffing into the body of the fish and fasten together with skewers; 
butter the fish sheet and place the fish upon it, putting il into a bak- 
ing pan; dredge with pepper, salt and flour; cover the bottom of the 
pan with hot water; bake in a hot oven about one hour, basting every 
fifteen minutes; when cooked, remove the sheet from the pan and 
slip the fish off carefully into a hot platter; pour around it tomato 
or Hollandaise sauce; garnish with lemon points and sprigs of 
parsley. 

FRIED FISH.

Meats — Boiling 



All fresh meats to be boiled should be plunged into boiling water 
and allowed to boil rapidly for ten or fifteen minutes, to coagulate 
the albumen and thus close the pores, keeping in the juices of the 
meat. After the meat has boiled for ten minutes place it where it 
will just simmer, until tender. Meat that boils rapidly will be 
stringy.

Broiling 



Broiling is the most perfect way of cooking meat and fish. There 
are three ways of broiling, — what is known as broiling proper, pan 
broiling and oven broiling. 

Broiling proper is to broil directly over the coals ; the fire must be 
hot, clear and free from smoke. For meat it must be hotter than for 
fish. Pan broiling is cooking upon a smoking hot griddle. Oven 
broiling is cooking in a very hot oven. The most delicious results are 
obtained by broiling steaks, chops, young chickens, squab, etc., 
directly over the glowing coals. Charcoal is best for broiling, but 
hard wood, coal or gas may be used, provided it is free from 
smoke. The point to be remembered in broiling is to have the fire, 
griddle or oven hot enough to instantly sear the outer surface of the 
meat. 

The best cuts of steak make the most delicious broils, tenderness 
being one of the essential qualities. It must be remembered, how- 
ever, that a second-class cut of steak taken from a first-class bullock 
will make a much better broil than a first class cut taken from a 
second-class beef. When selecting beef see that it has a thick rim 
of fat, that the lean is well marbled with fat and is of a bright red 
color after being exposed to the air for a short time. 

STEAKS. 

Have steak cut thick — two inches is the proper thickness for a 
steak ; it should never be cut less than one inch. Trim off the suet ; 
put between a double broiler and place it as close to the coals as 
possible ; allow it to cook for about a minute, or until the under side 
is Avell seared, then turn and sear the other side ; remove a little dis- 
tance from the coals and cook from fifteen to twenty minutes, turn- 
ing constantly. A steak that is broiled perfectly should be puffed out 
in the center and should be of a delicate pink color throughout. 
Serve immediately on a warm platter ; garnish with sprigs of parsley 
or watercress. 

PAN BROILING. 

To pan broil a steak, have the griddle smoking hot ; rub with fat ; 
place the steak on the griddle and press close ; let it cook one minute ; 
then, with a knife, loosen from the griddle and turn; sear the other 
side; reduce the heat slightly and cook from fifteen to twenty min- 
utes, turning very frequently ; do not prick the steak with a fork or 



22 PRACTICAL COOK BOOK 

the juice will escape. The steak can be easily turned with two 
knives by slipping- one under the steak and assisting to turn with the 
other. Broiled steak is served as soon as taken from the fire, sea- 
soned with pepper and salt. Maitre d' Hotel sauce is sometimes 
served with broiled steak. 

TIME FOR BROILING STEAKS. 

Steak two inches in thickness requires from fifteen to twenty 
minutes; one and one-half inches, from twelve to fifteen minutes; 
and one inch, from eight to ten minutes. 

LAMB AND MUTTON CHOPS. 

Remove the outer skin and all the suel from the chops; broil over 
the coals or on a hot griddle: serve with tomato sauce and season 
with salt and pepper; garnish with parsley. 

Note. — Before cooking lamb or mutton always remove the skin. 
It is in the skin that the disagreeable flavor exists. 

BROILED CHICKEN. 

Only very young chickens should be broiled. Singe and draw the 
chickens, picking out all pin-feathers; split down the hack; clean 
and wipe with wet towel; break the joints; sprinkle with salt and 
pepper; grease a double broiler; turn the inside of the chicken to 
the fire first ; turn frequently, being careful the lire is not too hot; 
broil about twenty minutes, or until the bird is tender and nicely 
browned; spread with softened butter and serve on a warm plate; 
garnish with parsley or watercress. 



Roasting 



Roasting and baking are now synonymous terms. We speak of 
roasting meats and baking breads, yet we use the same oven for both. 
Roasting formerly meant to place the meat on a spit before the open 
fire, turn it frequently and baste constantly to keep from burning. 
Roasting to-day means to bake in a hot oven. 

ROAST BEEF. 

There are seven prime ribs in a beef. Any of them will make a 
first-class roast. Do not have the ribs removed, but have them cut 
in two-inch pieces up to the thick muscle; cut these pieces of bone 
off, to be braised and served as short ribs of beef ; place the cut sur- 
face of the roast on a smoking hot griddle and press close; let cook for 



BOASTING 23 

two or three minutes, or until it is nicely seared ; turn and sear the 
other side ; set the roast, resting upon the edges of the ribs, on a rack 
in a dripping pan ; put into an oven hot enough to bake bread, and let 
cook ; do not season the meat and do not put water in the pan ; when 
the oven is at the proper temperature you will hear a gentle sputter- 
ing when the oven door is opened — if smoke issues from the oven it 
is too hot — if you do not hear a gentle sputtering increase the tem- 
perature. The time required for roasting depends upon the thickness 
of the roast ; fifteen minutes is allowed for each inch in thickness ; a 
roast four inches in thickness will cook rare in one hour; measure 
across the thickest part of a roast. A rump roast is seared in the 
same way and placed upon a rack in a hot oven ; allow fifteen min- 
utes to the pound. 

YORKSHIRE PUDDING. 

Two-thirds of a cupful of flour, One pint of milk, 
Three eggs, One teaspoonful of salt. 

Sift the flour and measure ; add the salt ; separate the eggs and add 
the yolks, unbeaten, to the flour; add a little of the milk and mix to 
a smooth paste ; add the rest of the milk gradually ; beat whites of 
the eggs to a stiff froth and stir into the batter ; pour into the roast- 
ing pan forty-five minutes before the roast is cooked ; serve hot with 
the roast of beef; if the roast is very fat pour some of the fat from 
the pan before putting in the pudding. 

BRAISED BEEF OR POT ROAST. 

Six or eight pounds chuck roast or a piece of the rump; trim and 
rub with pepper and salt ; cut a large onion into dice and brown in 
salt pork fat; put the roast into a braising pan; pour over it one 
quart of boiling water; add the onion; cover closely and cook in a 
moderate oven about four hours, turning after two hours, and add 
more water as it evaporates, so as to have three cups of gravy ; when 
tender take up the meat ; skim off the fat from the gravy and thicken 
with a tablespoonful or flour wet in a little cold water and strained 
into the gravy ; season with pepper and salt and a little lemon juice. 

VEAL HEART. 

Remove the tough membranes and soak in cold water and salt one 
hour ; wipe and stuff with stale bread crumbs seasoned with salt and 
pepper and moistened with melted butter; rub the heart with salt, 
pepper and dredge with flour ; fry brown in a pan with a little fat 
salt pork; place in braising kettle; add one pint of water, one tea- 
spoonful of minced onion ; sprig of parsley, three cloves, three pepper 
corns, one small carrot cut fine ; cover tightly and cook two hours in 
a moderately hot oven ; turn three or four times while cooking. 



94 PRACTICAL COOK BOOK 

ROAST LAMB OR MUTTON. 

Remove the skin from a leg of lamb or mutton ; sear the cut sur- 
faces on a hot griddle ; place on a rack in a roasting pan in a hot 
oven. A leg of lamb will roast in one hour and a quarter, while it 
requires one hour and three-quarters to roast a medium-sized leg 
of mutton. 

ROAST VEAL. 

Veal being a dry meat, requires basting to keep it moist and to 
enrichen it; rub the veal with sugar, salt and pepper, using one-half 
as much sugar as salt; place upon rack in roasting pan and let cook 
in a hot oven until nicely browned, then baste with a thin gravy 
made from one tablespoon i'ul of butter, one of flour and two cupfuls 
of stock or water; season with pepper and salt; baste every fifteen 
minutes; veal requires longer cooking than either beef or mutton; 
a five-pound roast will cook in two and one-half hours. 

PORK. 

Fresh pork is seasoned with pepper, salt and sugar. Roast and 
baste the same as veal. 



Poultry and Game 



TO DRAW POULTRY. 

All poultry should be dressed as soon as killed; the feathers come 
out more easily while the fowl is warm; strip them off toward the 
head; remove the pin-feathers with a knife; singe the hairs by hold- 
ing it over the gas jet or a piece of lighted paper; cut off the head; 
turn the skin back and cut off the neck close to the body; remove 
the windpipe and crop; to remove the feet, cut the skin just below 
the leg joint ; break the joint; with a skewer pull out the tendons; 
cut away the oil bag in the tail ; make an incision under the side bone 
near the tail large enough to insert two fingers; slip the fingers 
around the entrails; separating the membrane; when everything is 
loosened, get the fingers around the heart and pull out the entrails; 
then take out the lungs and kidneys; when everything is removed 
hold the fowl under the faucet and rinse well, then wipe dry. 

TO CLEAN GIBLETS. 

Remove the outside sack from the heart ; cut open and press out 
the clot of blood ; cut off the gall bladder from the liver, being care- 
ful not to break it. and cut away any discolored part of the liver; 



POULTRY AND GAME 25 

open the thick part of the gizzard and take out the inner sack with- 
out breaking; wash giblets and put into cold water; simmer until 
tender ; cook the neck with the giblets. 

TO TRUSS POULTRY. 

Draw the thighs up close to the body and pass a skewer through 
the thigh and into the body and out through the other thigh; pass 
another skewer through the wings, fastening them close to the 
body ; fold the skin at the neck over and pin it to the back with a 
skewer; cross the legs over the tail and tie with a stout twine, leav- 
ing two long ends ; pass the twine around the tail, bring it up, cross- 
ing in front and passing around -the skewer in the thighs; cross in 
the back and fasten around the skewer through the wings and tie 
firmly. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

Singe, draw, wash and wipe; stuff the body and neck with stale 
bread crumbs moistened with melted butter and seasoned with 
pepper, salt and celery salt ; truss and rub with butter ; lay the 
turkey, breast down, on the rack in the roasting pan ; put into a hot 
oven and cook until the back of the turkey is nicely browned, then 
turn it over and brown breast ; pour one pint of water into the pan 
after the turkey is browned ; baste every fifteen minutes, or when- 
ever the skin becomes very dry; allow about twenty-five minutes to 
the pound for roasting ; if the turkey browns too rapidly cover the 
breast with a heavy paper well buttered. Oysters or chopped celery 
may be added to the stuffing if desired. 

ROAST CHICKEN. 

Prepare the same as roast turkey; allow twenty minutes to the 
pound for roasting. 

ROAST DUCK. 

Many people prefer young ducks served rare ; when so liked, they 
are not stuffed. 

Pick, singe, draw and wash the duck; wipe, truss and dredge with 
salt, pepper and flour; roast in a hot oven about thirty minutes. 
Full-grown domestic ducks should be roasted about one hour and 
basted every ten minutes. Make a giblet gravy and serve with a 
grape or currant jelly. 

Ducks and geese have a strong flavor, and are improved by stuff- 
ing the body with apples or onions or coarse bits of celery, which 
absorb the flavor and should not be eaten. 



26 PRACTICAL COOK BOOK 

ROAST WILD DUCK. 

Nearly all wild ducks have a strong' or fishy flavor. To lessen 
this flavor put an onion cut in two into the body of the bird, and let 
stand some hours before cooking. 

(Mean the same as poultry and wipe both inside and out with a 
damp towel; tuck back the wings and truss the legs close to the 
body: rub with salt, pepper, butter and flour: place in a baking pan 
and add one cup of boiling water; roast twenty-five to thirty-five 
minutes in a hot oven, basting occasionally with butter; serve very 
hot. with slices of lemon or currant jelly. 



Frying 

Prying is cooking in hot fat deep enough to entirely cover the 
articles to be cooked. When food is properly tried the fat is hot 
enough to instantly sear the outer surface and thus prevent it soak- 
ing into the food. All food to be fried should be thoroughly dried; 
if water should drop into the hot fat it would cause the fat to boil 
over, and there is danger of it taking- fire and causing greal trouble. 
Food that does not contain sufficient albumen to form a coating on 
the outside as soon as immersed into the hot fat should be rolled in 
crumbs, then in egg and again in crumbs to form a grease-proof 
covering. A frying-basket, or a wire basket with a long handle, is 
very convenient for frying purposes. In many cook books we read, 
"heat the fat smoking hot." That depends entirely upon the kind 
of fat yon are using; lard will smoke at a much lower temperature 
than oil. When fat smokes it loses some of its browning properties; 
never let fat heat without putting a small piece of raw potato into 
it. As soon as the potato begins to brown drop in a fresh piece of 
potato; if it browns in one minute the fat is hot enough to fry 
potatoes and dough mixtures. For such food as we roll in bread 
crumbs and egg the fat should be hot enough to brown a bit of bread 
in forty seconds. 

The best fat for frying purposes is a mixture of beef suet and oil. 
as both these fats can be heated to a much higher temperature with- 
out smoking than lard. Olive oil is the purest fat for frying, but is 
too expensive for general use. 

For frying the same fat can be used several times if properly cared 
for. The most delicate croquettes can be fried in the same fat with 
fish and not be marred in flavor. When frying several different 
kinds of food at the same time, begin with potatoes, then dough mix- 
tures and lastly articles rolled in crumbs. 



FRYING 27 

When finished with the fat drop three or four slices of raw potato 
into it ; cool slightly, and strain through a fine strainer or a strainer 
cloth. 

FRENCH FRIED POTATOES. 

Pare the potatoes and cnt in strips one-half inch in thickness ; let 
stand in cold water one honr ; heat the fat hot enough to brown a 
thin slice of potato in one minute; wipe the potatoes; put into the 
frying basket and lower into the hot fat ; do not put a large quantity 
of potatoes in at one time, as they will lower the temperature of the 
fat and the potatoes will be soggy and greasy. When the potatoes 
are nicely browned lift from the fat and shake free from grease ; 
turn onto a piece of cheese cloth to absorb the fat ; dust lightly with 
salt, and serve immediately. French fried potatoes should be crisp 
and mealy. If they stand they become soggy. 

SARATOGA CHIPS. 

Pare the potatoes and slice very thin ; let them stand in cold water 
two or three hours ; wipe dry ; fry in fat hot enough to brown in one 
minute ; when nicely browned remove the basket and shake well ; 
turn chips onto cheese cloth or soft paper; dust well with salt. 

LAMB CHOPS BREADED. 

Trim the chops and remove the skin ; season with salt and pepper ; 
roll in fine bread crumbs ; dip in beaten egg* and roll again in bread 
crumbs; fry in hot fat. For a chop one inch in thickness it will re- 
quire six minutes to cook rare and from eight to ten to cook well 
done. 

Note. — One tablespoonful of water added to beaten egg makes a 
more elastic coating for fried food. 

FRIED CHICKEN. 

Cut the chicken into ten pieces ; season with pepper and salt ; roll 
in fine bread crumbs ; dip in beaten egg ; roll in crumbs, and fry in 
fat hot enough to brown a piece of bread in one minute. A young 
chicken will cook in ten minutes. Serve with sauce tartare or cream 
sauce ; garnish the dish with sprigs of parsley. 

Note. — For fried fish, see article on Fish. 

CROQUETTES. 

In making croquettes the material must be chopped fine, well 
mixed, and seasoned delicately. The shaping of croquettes can 
readily be acquired by a little practice and care. They are formed 
into cone, ball and cylindrical shapes. 



28 PRACTICAL COOK BOOK 

To Shape. — Take a tablespoonful of the mixture, roll gently be- 
tween the hands into a ball; have a board well sprinkled with fine 
dry bread crumbs and roll the croquette \erv gently on this into 
shape; dip into beaten egg, to which one tablespoonful of water has 
been added; water added to the 1 egg makes a more elastic coating 
than e^'u' alone; after dipping the croquette into the egg roll it again 
in the bread crumbs mid then fry in fat hot enough to brown a piece 
of bread in forty seconds; cook until nicely browned — it will re- 
quire about two minutes; shake free from fat and lay on cheese 
cloth or soft brown paper.

before frying, as the frying will require your full attention; the fat 
should be hot enough to brown a piece of potato in one minute. 



Sauteing is cooking food in a small quantity of fat. Butter, when 
clarified, is the most satisfactory for some things, as it browns nicely 
and gives a delicious flavor to the food, but lard or drippings may be 
used. 

CLARIFIED BUTTER. 

To clarify butter, let it boil gently for about a minute — the salt 
will settle to the bottom ; the scum which rises to the top should be 
skimmed off, leaving the oil clear. 

MUSH. 

Cut cold mush into thin slices; cook on a griddle buttered with 
clarified butter until nicely browned. 

FRIED APPLES. 

Cut tart apples in thin slices; dust lightly with flour, and fry in

water; cover the spider closely and let simmer ten minutes; serve on 
a hot platter; add one-fourth of a cupful of sweet milk to the gravy 
in the spider, and serve with the chops. 

PORK CHOPS. 

Season and cook the same as veal cutlets; veal and pork require 
long; and thorough cooking. 

HAMBURG STEAKS. 

One pound of round steak chopped very fine; one tablespoonful of 
minced onion; pepper and salt to taste: mix the meat and seasonings 
thoroughly together; shape into cakes aboul three-fourths of an inch 
in thickness; grease the griddle or spider well ; brown nicely on both 
sides: cook about five minutes, and serve. 

CALF'S LIVER.

and roll in flour: cook in bacon fat until nicely browned ; serve with 
breakfast bacon or fried apples, or cover the liver with boiling water 
and let stand five minutes; season with pepper and salt : roll in Hour 
and fry in bacon fat or clarified butter. 



Salads 

Salads, to be palatable, should always be crisp and fresh and 
served icy cold. It is upon its crispness and the proper mingling and 
selection of ingredients that its success depends ; when lettuce is to 
be used it must be washed carefully, taking care not to break the 
leaves. The large dark leaves are not nice for salad. Of celery only 
the white crisp parts are used, the green, tough parts being utilized 
for soups and stews. All fresh vegetables to be used for salads 
should stand in ice water until just before serving time. Vegetable 
salads are served after the meat course at dinner — a rich salad, such 
as lobster, chicken, sweetbread, etc., is out of place at a heavy meal. 
These latter are best served at lunches or suppers. In arranging a 
salad on a dish or in a bowl, handle it very gently; do not press it 
into form. The garnishings should be of the freshest and crispest 
kind. 



SALADS :>:; 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING. 

Yolks of two eggs, One level teaspoonful of salt, 

One level teaspoonful of sugar, One pint of olive oil, 

One-half level teaspoonful of dry Juice of one lemon, 

mustard, Two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. 

When making mayonnaise, have utensils and ingredients very 
cold; a Dover egg-beater or a fork may be used; beat the yolks of 
the eggs until very creamy ; add the seasonings and beat again ; then 
add the oil very slowly until the mixture thickens ; when it gets too 
thick to beat add one tablespoonful of lemon juice or vinegar ; then 
more oil until it again thickens, then more lemon or vinegar, and con- 
tinue until the full amount is used. A cup of whipped cream added 
to the dressing just before using improves the flavor; the whipped 
whites of the eggs added will increase the bulk. 

FRENCH DRESSING. 

One tablespoonful of sharp vine- One-fourth of a teaspoonful of sail , 

gar, One-half saltspoonful of pepper. 

Three tablespoonfuls of olive oil. 

Mix the vinegar, salt, pepper and oil together and beat with a fork

spoonfuls of lemon juice, one-half teaspoonful of salt and one-half 
saltspoonful of pepper ; let stand in a cold place ; cut into half -inch 
dice enough tender white celery to make three eupfuls ; mix the 



34 PEACTICAL COOK BOOK 

chicken and celery together; moisten with mayonnaise dressing; add 
one-half cupful of whipped cream; arrange in salad bowl; garnish 
the dish with crisp bits of celery or white celery leaves. 

Equal parts of chicken and sweetbread, or chicken and veal mixed 
with celery make a nice salad. 

SWEETBREAD SALAD. 

Cover the sweetbread with cold water: add one teaspoont'nl of salt 
and stand two or three hours; drain: cover with boiling water: add 
one teaspoont'nl of lemon juice; cook until tender; drain; drop into 
cold water and let stand until cold; remove the membranes and pnll 
apart with a silver fork into small pieces; mix two cupfuls of sweet- 
breads, two tablespoonfuls of vinegar, one-half teaspoont'nl of salt

Vegetables 



AH green vegetables must be cooked in freshly boiled salted water; 
allow one teaspoonful of salt for each quart of water. The younger 
the vegetable the more quickly it will cook. 

POTATOES. 

Nearly every housekeeper fancies she can cook a potato, and yet 
we have so many soggy and poor-flavored potatoes brought to our 
tables. The potato is composed chiefly of starch and water. When 
subjected to heat the starch cells burst and the potato becomes ten- 
der. If removed from the water or oven as soon as the starch is set 
free the potato will be mealy and dry, but if allowed to cook longer 
the starch will absorb the moisture and the potato be soggy. 

BOILED POTATOES. 

If cooking new potatoes, boil them in their jackets; old potatoes, 
scrub, pare and let stand in cold water two or three hours to freshen 
them; cover with boiling water, to which a teaspoonful of salt has 
been added, and boil gently from twenty to thirty minutes ; medium- 
sized potatoes will require thirty minutes; rapid boiling will break 
the potatoes; when cooked drain off every drop of water; remove 
the cover and shake the saucepan over the fire until the potatoes 
are dry and mealy; serve immediately. The potatoes should be put 
on to boil just one-half hour before they are to be served. If they 
must stand, set the saucepan on the back part of the stove and cover 
with a towel until serving time. The towel will absorb the moisture. 



VEGETABLES 41

NOTES ON CAKE MAKING. 

Have the bowl warm, the butter soft, sugar fine; use a wooden 
spoon for beating; never mix cake in tin; have pans perfectly clean; 
do not grease the pans ; paper the bottom of the pan, and, for butter 
cakes, butter lightly the upper side of the paper. When baked slip 
a knife around the edges of the cake to loosen it; let stand in the 
pan until you can handle the pan without a holder; let butterless 
cake stand in the pan until cold; when a cake is nearly baked it will 
shrink from the sides of the pan.

of the can fits into the socket in the tub ; put on the crosspiece and 
turn to see if everything is in place; break the ice very fine ; put a 
layer of about four inches in the bottom of the tub. and then a layer 
of salt, using about three times as much ice as salt; put on another 
layer of ice and one of salt, and continue until the tub is full ; turn 
the crank slowly until the cream begins to harden, then turn rapidly 
for about ten minutes. It will be hard to turn when the mixture is 
frozen; wipe the salt and water from the cover; turn back the cross- 
piece and take off the cover without displacing the can ; remove the 
beater and scrape the cream from it ; pack the cream down ; put on 
the cover and cork the hole; put on the crosspiece and pack the ice 
tightly, adding more ice and salt; let stand two or three hours to

Beverages 

COFFEE. 

Mocha and -lava coffee are supposed to make the best mixture. 
The best grade, however, should be bought. It should always be 
ground just before using and never bought ground, as it quickly 
loses its flavor, even if kept in air-tight tins. 

Coffee should not be boiled longer than one or two minutes; when 
coffee is boiled for a long time we lose from our beverage the deli- 
cious aroma which permeates the room, leaving the coffee bitter. 
Allow one tablespoonful of coffee for each cupful, and one for the 
pot. 

Five tablespoonfuls of finely One egg white, or two egg shells, 

ground coffee, Two cupfuls of boiling water. 

Two cupfuls of cold wafer.

A few of the many reasons why 

Carnation Milk 



I S BEST 



Carnation Cows 
browse in the 
sun -kissed fields 
and meadows in 
the States of 
Washington and 
Oregon — west of 
the mountains — 
where the pas- 
tures are green 
the year 'round 




STERILIZED! 

rJllfe 




Nature has pro- 
vided numerous 
springs and the 
best of mountain 
streams 

Climatic condi- 
tions are perfect 

Wholesome 
well - bred cows 
and p e r f e c t 
sanitation go to 
make up the rest 



SERIAL NUMBER 2205 



On account of its purity, richness in butterfat, etc- Miss 

Tracy recommends and uses Carnation Milk in all her 

lectures and demonstrations
