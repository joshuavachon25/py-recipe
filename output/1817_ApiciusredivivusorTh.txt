PREFACE. 



Ihe following Receipts are not a mere manow- 
less collection of shreds, and patches, and cuttings, and 
pastings, from obsolete works, but a bona fide register 
of practical facts, accumulated by a perseverance not to 
be subdued or evaporated by the igniferous terrors of a 
roasting fire in the dog-days, or a vote of censure from 
the Cooks' Company, for thus daring to promulgate the 
profound mysteries of the (till now, in the following 
pages, explained and elucidated to the humblest capa- 
city,) occult art of cookery. The Receipts have been 
written down by the fire-side, " with a spit in one hand, 
and a pen in the other," in defiance of the combined 
odoriferous and califacient repellents of roasting and 
boiling, frying and broiling; the author submitting to 
a labour no preceding cookery-book-maker, perha]»s, 
ever attempted to encounter; and having not only 
dressed, but eaten each R^eceipt before he set it down in 
his book. As they have all been received with a hearty 
welcome by a sufficiently well educated palate, and a

.rather fastidious stomach ; perhaps this certificate of 
the eatabihty of the respective preparations will partly 
apologize for the book containing a smaller number of 
them than some preceding writers on this gratifying 
subject have transcribed for the profit and amusement 
of *' every man's master," the STOMACH*, 

1 have endeavoured to describe each preparation in 
£0 plain and circumstantial a manner as I hope will be 
easily understood, even by the amateur who is wholly 
unacquainted with the practical part of culinary con- 
cerns. Old housekeepers may think I have been tedi- 
ously minute on many points, which, to them, appear 
trifling, and former writers on this subject have 
deemed unworthy of attention. But these little delicate 
distinctions constitute all the difference between 
a common table and an elegant one, and are not 
trifles to the novice, who must learn them either from 
the communication of others, or blunder on till his own 
slowly -accumulating and dear-bought experience 
teaches him. A wish to save trouble and time to un- 
informed beginners, was ray motive for publishing this 
book, and I could accomplish it only by supposing 
the reader, when he first opens my book, to be as igno- 
rant of cookery as I was when I first thought of writing 
on the subject. 
By a cartful attention to the directions herein given, 

* " Tiie stomach is the grand organ of the human system, 
upon the state of whicli all the powers and feelings of the 
individual depend." — See Hunter's Culina, page 13. 



PREFACE. 

the most ignorant will easily learn to prepare food", 
not only in siu agreeable and wholesome, but in an 
elegant and economical manner. 

The cardinal virtues of cookery, " cleanliness, 

FRUGALITY, NOURISHMENT, AND PALATEABLE- 

NESS," preside overeach preparation ; for I have not pre- 
sumed to insert a single composition without previously 
obtaining the *' imprimatur" of an enlightened and most 
indefatigable " COMMITTEE OF TASTE," whose 
persevering and cordial co-operation I cannot too highly 
praise ; and here most gratefully record the unremitting 
zeal they manifested during their arduous progress of 
proving the respective recipes, who were so truly philo- 
sophically and disinterestedly regardless of the wear and 
tear of teeth and stomach, that their labour appeared a 
pleasure to them. This laudable perseverance has enabled 
me to give the most inexperienced amateur this unerring 
guide how to excite as much pleasure as possible on the 
palate, with as little trouble as possible to the principal 
viscera. 

Every attention has been paid in directing the pro- 
portions of the folk rt'ing compositions, not merely to 
make them inviting to the appetite, but agreeable 
and useful to the stomach ; nourishing without being 
inflammatory, and savoury without being surfeiting. 

I have no new forms of luxury to communicate ; no 
claims to the Roman Emperor's bounty for inventing a 
new pleasure ; nor do I pretend to give any information

to those graud masters and mistresses of the alimentary 
art, who are commonly called '* profess cooks/' 
whose greatest praise is in contriving disiies, not to allay 
the appetite, but to excite it, to gratify those who 
live upon sauces instead of food, and w ho see the sua 
rise with no other hope than that they shall fill their 
bellies before it sets. I have written for those who 
Qiake nourishment the chief end of eating *, and do not 

* Although pleasing the palate be the main end in most 
books of cookery, it is my aim to blend the toothsome 
with the wholesome; for, after all, however the hale Gourmand 
may at first differ from me in opinion, the latter is the chief 
concern ; since if he be even so entirely devoted to the pleasure 
of eating, as to think of no other, still the care of his health 
becomes part of that ; if he is sick, he cannot relish his 
food. 

" The term gourma-nd, or epicure, has been strangely per- 
verted ; it has been conceived synonimous with a gluttony 
like that of the great eater of Kent; or a fastidious appetite 
only to be excited by fantastic dainties, as the brains of pea- 
cocks or parrots, the tongues of thrushes and nightingales, or 
the teals of a lactiferous sow. In the liberal acceptation of 
the term epicure, and as I use it, it means only the person 
who relishes his food cooked according to scientific principles, 
so prepared that the palate is delighted, rendered of easy so- 
lution in the stomach, and ultimately contributing to health; 
exciting him, as an animal, to the vigorous enjoyment of those 
recreations and duties, physical and intellectual, which con- 
stitute the happiness and dignity of his nature." In this cty-

desire to provoke appetite beyond the power and 
necessities of nature ; proceeding, however, on the 
purest Epicurean principles of indulging the palate as 
far as it can be done without injury or offence to the 
stomach. The pleasures of the table have always been 
highly appreciated and carefully cultivated in all coun- 
tries and in all ages ; and, in spite of the Stoics, every 
one will allow they are the first we enjoy, the last we 
leave, and those we taste the oftenest. A sound stomach 
may be said to be the mainspring of all our comfort ; and 
there would be no ditiiculty in proving that this viscera 
influences (much more than people in general imagine) ali 
our actions : the destiny of nations has often depended 
upon the more or less laborious digestion of a prime 
minister. The great philosopher Pythagoras^ in his Gol^ 
den Ferses, shews himself to have been extremely nice in 
eating, and makes it one of his chief principles of morality 
to " abstain from beans." Our great Euglisli moralist^ 
Dr. Johnson, (says Boswell,) was a man of very nice dis- 
cernment in the science of cookery, and talked of good 
eating with uncommon satisfaction. " Some people," 
said he, " have a foolish way of not minding, or pre- 
tending not to mind what they eat i for my part, I mind

ray belly very studiously and very carefully, and I 
look upon it, that he who does not mind his belly, will 
hardly mind any thing else." Mr. B. adds, " I never 
knew a man who relished good eating more than he 
did: when at table, he was totally absorbed in the 
business of the moment : nor would he, unless in very 
high company, say one word, or even pay the least at- 
tention to what was said by others, till he had satisfied 
his appetite." 

The Receipts are the results of experiments carefully 
made and accurately and circumstantially detailed, the 
time requisite for dressing being stated, and the quantities 
of the various articles contained in each composition being 
given either by weight or measure *, a precision never 
before attempted in former cookery books, but which 
I found indispensable, from the impossibility of guessing 
the quantities intended by the usual obscure expressions 

* The weights are avoirdupois; the measure, the gradu- 
ated jjlass used by apothecaries, which appeared more accu- 
rate and convenient than any, the pint being divided into six- 
teen ounces, and the ounce into eight drachms : by a wine- 
glass, is to be understood two ounces of apothecaries' liquid 
measure; by a large or table spoonful, half an ounce; by a 
small or tea spoonful, a drachm, or half a quarter of an ounce, 
i. e. nearly equal to two drachms avoirdupois. At Hancock's 
glass warehouse, in Cockspur Street, Charing Cross, you may 
get measures divided into tea and table spoons. No cook 
should be without one, who wishes to be regular in her 
business. 



PREFACE. 

employed for this purpose in former works ; such as, a 
little bit of salt, a good bit of butter, a handful of this, 
a pinch of that, a shake of pepper, a squeeze of lemon, 
a dash of vinegar, a dust of flour, and season it to your 
palate, (meaning the cook's,) which, if she has any, it is 
very unlikely that it is in unison with that of her em- 
ployers, as, by continually tasting piquante relishes, 
it becomes blunted and insensible, and soon loses 
the faculty of appreciating delicate flavours, so that every 
thing is done at random. 

These culinary technicals* are so difi'erently estimated 
by diflferent cooks, and " the rule of thumb" is so ex- 
tremely indefinite, that if the same dish be dressed by 
two persons, it will generally be so unlike, that 
nobody would imagine they had worked from the same 
directions ; nor will they assist a person who has not 
served a regular apprenticeship in the kitchen, more 
than reading " Robinson Crusoe" would ienable a sailor to 
steer safely from England to India. 

* " In the present language of cookery, there has been a 
■woeful departure from the sirapiicity of our ancestors; such a 
farrago of unappropriate and unmeaning terms, many cor- 
rupted from the French, others disguised from the Italian, 
some misapplied from the German, wiule many are a dis" 
grace to the English. What can any person suppose to be 
the meaning of a shoulder of lamb in epigram, ui less it vvere 
a poor dish, for a pennyiess poet ? aspect ofji)ikj uould appear 
calculated for an astrologer, and shoulder of mutton surprised^ 
desigp.ed for a sheep-stealer." — A. C.junr. 



PRF.FACE. 

This carelessness in the cook is the more surj)risln2^, 
as the confectioner is regularly attentive, in the descrip- 
tion of his preparations, to give tlie exact quanlities, 
tliough iiis business, con)])ared to cookery, is as unim- 
portant as the ornamental is inferior to the useful : yet 
the maker of hianchmange, custanis, and trifles, an(t 
the endless and useless collection of pretty play-thing* 
for the palate, is scrupulously exact, even to a grain, itt 
his ingredients, whilst the cooks affect to be most unin- 
telligibly indefinite, although they are intrusted with the 
administration of our food, upon the proper preparation 
of which all our powers of both body and mind dej)end ; 
the energy being invariably in the ratio of the perform- 
ance of the restorative process. Unless the stomach be 
in good humour, every part of the machinery of life 
will vibrate with languor. 

We may compare the human frame to a watch, of 
which the heart is the main spring, the stomach the re- 
gulator, ami what we pat into it the key by which the 
machine is set agoing; according to the quantity, 
quality, and proper digestion of what we eat and 
drink, will be the pace of the pulse, and the action of 
the system in general : and when a due proportion is 
preserved between the (piantuni of exercise and that of 
cxritement, all goes well: when disordered, the same 
expedients are enii:>;o}ed for its readjustment as are 
used by the watch maker; the machine requires to be 
carefully cleaned,, and then judiciously oiled. 



FREFACE. 

Thus does our health always, and the life often of 
invalids, and those who have weak and infirm stomachs, 
depend upon the skill of the cook. Our forefathers 
were so well aware of this, that in days of yore no man of 
consequence thought of making a day's journey without 
taking his " Magister Coqiiorum' w'lXh, him. The variety 
of this talent in a high degree is so well understood, 
thai besides very considerable pecuniary compensa- 
tion, his Majesty's first and second cooks are now Es- 
quires by their olFice ; and we have every reason to sup- 
pose they were persons of equal dignity heretofore. In 
Dr. Pegge's " Forme of Cur i/" Svo. London, 1780, wc 
read, that when Cardinal Otto, the pope's legate, was a-t 
Oxford, A. D. 1248, his brotiier officiated as *' Magisfei" 
CoquinfcJ' This important post has always been held as 
a situation of high trust and confidence, and the " Mn<r^ 
mis Coquug," chief cook, or Master-Kifchiner, has, 
time immemorial, been an officer of considerable dig' 
nity in the palaces of princes. 

I believe it is a generally received opinion, which 
the experience of every individual can confirm, that 
the food we fancy most, appears to sit easiest on the 
stomach: liie functions of digestion must go on 
more merrily when exercised by food we relish, than 
w hen we eat merely because it is the usual hour of dining, 
or swallow something out of necessity, to appease 
Ihe raging of the gastric juices. 

Instinct speaks pretty plainly to those whose instru- 



PREFACE. 

ments of digestion are in a delicate ^nd impaired state, 
and commonly pleads with more perfect truth (for those 
materials thev stand most in need of,) than any dietetic 
rules that can be contrived. 

To affirm tliat such a thing is wholesome, or un- 
wholesonje, without considering the sul)ject in all the 
circumstances which it bears relation to, is, with sub- 
mission, talking nonsense *. 

No regimen of life can be laid down that will suit 
every body ; no food is so delicious that it pleases all 
palates ; and nothing can be more correct than the old 
adage, '* one man's meat is another man's poison." 

It would be as difficult for a Laplander to convince 
our good citizens that train oil is a more elegant relish 

* Cehus spoke very sensibly v.hen he said, " that a healthy 
man under his own governraent, ought not to tie himself up 
by strict rules, nor to abstain from any sort of food; that he 
ought sometimes to fast, and sometimes to feast.'' When ap- 
plied to eating, nothing is more true than that 

" Bonurum rerum, consuetudo pessima est." 
The author of this work wishes he had leisure to devote more 
time to the subject. An ingenious chemist, and an intelligent 
cook, might form a very complete work, by taking for their 
text Dr. George Pearson's admirably ar anged catalogues 
of food, drink, and seasoning; the most comprehensive and 
karned abstract of this subject we have ever seen. This 
epitome was printed for his Lectures on Therapeutics, &c. 
which the author attended in 1801.

.than their favourite turtle, as for the former to fancy 
that Alderman Birch or Mr. Angeli's soup can be as 
agreeable, as the grease and garbage, which custom has 
taught him to call delicious. 

The cook, therefore, should be cautious of seasoning 
high, and leave it to the eaters to add the condiments 
according to their own palate and fancy : for this pur- 
pose, ** The Magazine of TastCy' or *' Sauce-box* " will 
be found an invaluable acquisition, as its contents 
will instantaneously produce any flavour that may be 
desired. 

I have a very good reason to give in support of my 
doctrine, that what the appetite desires most, the sto- 
mach will digest best, which is, that masticationf, the

t To chew long and leisurely is the only way to extract the 
quintessence of our food, to completely enjoy the taste of it^ 
and to render it easily assimilable and convertible into lauda- 
ble chyle, by the facility it gives to the gastric juices to dissolve 
it without trouble. The pleasure of the palate, and the 
health of the stomach, are equally promoted by this salutary 
habit, which all should be taught to acquire in their infancy. 
The more tender the meat is, the more we may eat of it. 
From thirty to forty may be given as the mean number of 
munches that solid meat requires, to prepare it for its journey 
down the red lane, according to the tenderness of the meat ; 
less will be sufficient for tender, delicate, and easily digest- 
ible white meats. The sagacious g^ounnand must calculate 
this precisely, and not waste his precious moments in useless 



PREFACE. 

first act of the important process of digestion, is then 
more perfectly performed ; because, as we naturally 
detain upon our palate those things which please it, the 
food we relish most is consequently most broken down 
by chewing, and most intimately incorporated with the 
saliva. 

To encourage the best performance of the machinery 
of mastication, the cook must take care that her din- 
ner is not only well dressed, but that each dish be sent 
to table with its proper accompaniments in the neat- 
est and most elegant manner. 

jaw-work, or invite an indigestion by neglecting mastication. 
I cannot give any rules for this, as it depends so much on the 
strength or weakness of the subject, especially the state of the 
teeth and maxillary glands : every one ought to ascertain the 
condition of these useful working tools, and to use them with 
proportionate diligence is an indispensable exercise which every 
rational epicure will cheerfully perform, who has a proper 
regard for the welfare of his stomach/' — Almanack des Gour- 
mands, vol. iii. page 249, &c. Mastication is the source of all 
good digestion : with it almost any thing may be put into any 
stomach with impunity : without it, digestion must be always 
difficult, and frequently impossible : and be it remem- 
bered, it is not merely what we eat, but what we digest well, 
that nourishes us. The sagacious gourmand is ever raindfnl 
ot his motto,

PREFACE. 

Ilemember, that to excite the good opinion of the 
eve, is the first step towards awakening the appetite. 

Decoration is much more rationally employed in 
rendering a plain, wholesome, and nutritious dish in- 
viting, than in the elaborate embellishments which are 
crowded about custards and trifles. 

Not only the health and comfort of the family, but so 
many other things are, of necessity, intrusted to her dis- 
cretion, that an honest and frugal cook who knows her 
business, and conscientiously studies the interest of her 
employers, deserves every encouragement ; and if you 
are not generous enough to give it to her in money, you 
invite her to levy contributions on every article' con- 
fided to her care ; and do not be surprised, should she 
now and then strip your meat of its fat, crib your 
candles, and cabbage your potatoes, to increase the 
weight of the grease-pot. Depend upon it, *' true 
self-love and social are the same;" and i am always for 
giving to those we are obliged to trust, every inducement 
to be honest, and no temptations to play tricks. 

" It is impossible for a cook in large families to attend 
to her business in the kitchen with any degree of certain 
perfection, if she is employed in other houseiiold con- 
cerns. It is a service of such importance, and so ditli 
cult to perform even tolerably well, that it is sulKcientto 
engross the entire devotion and attenlion of at least one 
person. Yet, this is a maxim which is neither generally 
understood nor admired in some families, where the 



PREFACE, 

cook is also expected to be a house servant, and coals arc 
meted out to her by the quart, and butter by the pat, 
&c. : nevertheless, these unreasonable masters and mis- 
tresses are surprised if most of their ragouts, and 
sauces, &c. are spoiled ; and the roasts either burnt up, 
or not half done ; but how can it be otherwise, when the 
cook is obliged to be the slave of the bell 1" &c. 

A good cook has really quite enough to do if she at- 
tends perfectly to her own business ; and those who wish 
to have their tables well served, must not require any 
more of her, and are fortunate mortals if they regularly 
obtain this. Mistress of her time, she will devote the 
whole of it to her art; rising with the sun in winter, 
and by six in summer, her first care will be to set 
every thing to rights in her kitchen, see that all her 
utensils are perfectly clean, and arrange them in their 
proper places. This done, she puts on her soup-kettle, 
and does not leave it till she has well skimmed it : she 
will then go early to market, to have the opportunity of 
selecting from those shops which have the best choice, 
and charge reasonably. On her return home, she 
will prepare the dinner according to the bill of fare 
which she has settled with her master the evening 
before ; prepare her made dishes, ragouts, &c. &o. 
for the second course; lard and trim the roasts; and, in 
a word, get every thmg ready in time, so that the ser- 
vice may not meet with any obstruction. 

When this time comes, she seasons her soup, garnishes 



PREFACE. 

all her dishes, and disposes them in the order they are 
to appear in. 

Besides understanding the management of the spit, 
the stewpans, and the rolling-pin, a complete cook must 
know how to go to market, write legibly, and keep 
accounts: she must, moreover, have a full share of 
cleanliness, good temper, and activity; never give herself 
airs, but receive as the highest testimonies of her em- 
ployers' regard, whatever observations they make on her 
work, as the most unequivocal proofs of their desire to 
make her thoroughly understand their taste, and retain 
her in their service. She must entirely enter into all their 
plans of economy, and endeavour to make the most of 
every thing, as well for her own honour, as her master's 
profit. 

In those houses where the cook enjoys the confidence 
of her master so much as to be intrusted with the care 
of the store-room, which is not very common, she will 
keep an exact account of every thing as it comes in, for 
her own satisfaction, as well as that of her employer, 
and will not trust the key of this room to any one; she 
will also keep an account of every thing she takes from 
it, and manage with as much consideration and fru- 
gality as if it was her own property she was using, en- 
deavouring to disprove the adage, that *' plenty makes 
waste." The honesty of a cook must be above all 
suspicion : she should obtain, and (in spite of the 
numberless temptations that daily oiler to bend her

If we now take a review of the qualifications* we * 

have set down as indispensable, to form that highly es- : 

timable domestic, ** a complete, good cook," we shail find ■ 
how very few deserve that name. The majority of those 
Mho set up for masters and mistresses of this art, are

thing they can: others add indolence to insolence: 
those who understand their business, (which are by far 
the smallest number,) are too often either most ridicu- 
lously saucy, or insatiably thirsty ; in a word, a good 
subject, in this class, is a vara avis indeed. 

** Happy the master who finds a servant, who with a 
proper knowledge of her business unites a zeal and 
pride to perform it to the best of her abilities, and is, 
moreover, honest and cleanly : for the rest, he must be 
indulgent, and such a servant deserves to be treated 
with some consideration. Give her liberal wages, 
according to her deserts, and treat her with kindness, 
but without familiarity : do not pass any dish without 
observation, qualifying your censure by telling her, 

" The reason why 1 point out faults sq small, 
Is, 'cause 'tis better to have none at all." 

When you make out the bill of fare for the next day, 
lake every opportunity of encouraging her. Due praise 
is the most agreeable reward a woman can receive, and 
more gratifying than pecuniary compensation ; and 
is the way to make a faithful servant, who will be a 
treasure." 

The foregoing observations are from the ingenious 
French author we iiave before quoted. 

I have submitted (with no small pains,) to an atten- 
tive perusal of every preceding work, connected with 
the subject, that I could meet with ; in number amount-

ing to no fewer than one hundred and seventeen. These 
books vary but little from each other, except in the 
prefatory matter: cutting and pasting seem to have 
been much oftener employed than the pen and ink : 
any one who has occasion to refer to two or three of 
them, will fiud the receipts almost always " verbatim et 
literatim ;" equally unintelligible to those who are igno- 
rant of, and ustless to those who are acquainted with, 
the business of the kitchen. 

In my tedious progress through these books, I often 
wished the authors had been satisfied with giving us 
the results of their own practice and experience*, iu- 

* Thomas Carter, in the preface to his " City and Country 
Cook,''' London, 1738, says, " What I have published, is al- 
most the only book, one or two excepted, which of late years 
has come into the world, that has been the result of the 
author's own practice and experience : for though very few 
eminent practical cooks have ever cared to publish what they 
knew of the art ; yet they have been prevailed on, for a small 
premium from a bookseller, to lend their names to perform- 
ances in this art, unworthy their owning." 

Robert May, in the introduction to his '^Accomplished Cook,'^ 
1665, says, " To all honest and well-intendiyig persons of my 
profession^ and others, thi$ book cannot but be acceptable, as 
it plainly and profitably discovers the mystery of the whole art ; 
for which, though I may be envied by some, that only value 
their private interests above posterity and the public good ; 
yet, (he adds,) God and my own conscience would not permit 
Oie to buj'y these, my experiences, with my silver hairs in the 
grave.

of either dressing or eating, and without having 
applied both these tests, and ascertaining the practica- 
bility of preparing their receipts, and their ealability 
when done, they should never have ventured to recom- 
mend them to others ; so that the reader may put the

page doubled down in Epictetus, that is a feast for an 
emperor." — Jer, Was Epictetus a real cook, or did 
he only write receipts ]"

obsolete works, such as the ** Choice Manuel of Secrets,^* 
the " True Gentlewoman's Delight," &c. of as much 
use, in this age of refinement, as the following curious

confined to the business of the kitchen, to endeavour to 
improve the ignorant, and remind the skilful, how and 
when to make the best and the most of every thing. I 
have taken xery great pains to teach the young cook how 
to perform, in the best manner, the common business of 
her profession ; and being well grounded in that, she 
will find it easy to do all the rest to satisfaction, and 
will be able to shew, that an English girl, properly in- 



PREFACE. 

structed, can equal the best foreign gentleman iu 
every thing, except impudence and extravagance, and 
send up a delicious dinner with half the usual expense 
and trouble. I have endeavoured to lessen the labour 
of those who wish to be thoroughly acquainted with 
their profession ; and they will find, that an attentive 
perusal of the following pages will save them much of 
the irksome drudgery attending an apprenticeship at 
the stove ; an ordeal so severe, that few pass it with- 
out irreparable injury to their health, whilst many lose 
their lives before they learn their business. " Cleanliness, 
and a proper ventilation to carry off smoke and steam, 
should be particularly attended to in the construction 
of a kitchen; and the grand scene of action, the fire- 
place, should be placed where it may receive plenty of 
light : hitherto the contrary has prevailed, and the poor 
cook is continually basted with his own perspiration." 
— A. C. Junr.* 

^ A good dinner is one of the greatest enjoyments of human 
life; and the practice of cookery is attended with not only so 
many disgusting and disagieeable circumstances, but even 
dangers, tliat we ought to have some regard for those who en- 
counter them for our pleasure, and to reward their attention, 
by rendering their situation every way as agreeable and com- 
fortable as we can, for mere money is not a sufficient com- 
pensation to a complete cook. 

To say nothing of the deleterious vapours and exhalations 
of the charcoal, which 60on undermine the health of the

PREFACE. 

I have here done my utmost candidly to communi- 
cate, in as clear and intelligible a manner as I am able, 

heartiest, the glare of a vivid scorching fire, and the smoke 
so baneful to the eyes and the coinple^^ion : these are conti-^ 
nual and inevitable dangers, and a cook, must live in the 
midst of them, as a soldier in a field of battle, surrounded by 
bullets, and bombs, and Congreve's rockets ; with this 
only difference, that for the first, every day is a fighting day, 
that his warfare is almost always without glory," and his 
most praiseworthy achievements pass not only without re- 
ward, but frequently without even thanks; for the name of 
the most consummate cook is, alas! seldom heard by the* ■ 
guests who frequent his master's table J who, while ihey are*^ 
eagerly devouring his turtle, and drinking his wine, care very 
little who dressed the one, or sent the other. 

The master who wishes to enjoy the rare luxury of a table 
regularly well served in the best style, must treat his cook 
as his friend, and watch over his health * with the tenderest 
care, and especially be sure his taste dots not suffer from his 
stomiich being deranged by bilious attacks, &c. 

The most experienced artists cannot be sure of their work 
without tasting ; they must be incessantly tasting; and the 
spoon of a good cook is continually passing from the stewpans 
to his tongue; for nothing but fiequent tasting his sauces,^ -S 
ragouts, Szc.f can discover to him what progress they'^*'

But, alas ! the constant empyreumatic fumes of the stoves, 
the necessity of frequent drinking, and often of bad beer, to

conspires quickly to vitiate the organs of taste : the palate 
becomes blunted, its quickness of feeling and delicacy, on 
which the sensibility of the organs of taste depends, grows 
daily .mare obtuse, and in time becomes quite indurated, and 
the gustatory nerves unexcitable and unmoveable.

those stupid slaves, who pass their lives in as much obscurity 
as their own stewpans. 

To the preceding observations from the " Almanach des

a still better chance of success, if he can prevail on his master 
to observe the same regime which he orders for his cook.

♦COURT OF REQUESTS, Tuesday, Nov. 5,1816. 

HOWARD V. PHILLIPS. 

This was a case of some importance to the public. The 
defendant, a walkiug poulterer, was summoned by the plaia- 
tiff, a widow lady residing near the Asylum, to shew cause 
wliy he did not pay back to her four shillings, which he had ob- 
tafned fiom her under false representations. Tlie plaintiff 
stated, that the defendant called at her house on Wednesday 
last, and inquired if she wanted a fine fowl,, as he had some 
he could recommend. She desired he w ould select her one she 
might depend upon as being young and good. He accord- 
ingly picked our one which he said he could recommend as 
being a young one, and she took it upon his recommeiiddtion, 
and paid him four shillings. At dinner, however, to her great 
dismay, on attempting to carve this delicate young chicken, 
»he discovered that so great an attachment had the bones and 
joints formed to each otiierfrom long acquaintance, that they 
successfully' resisted all her attempts to separate them, and 
she was obliged to give over the attempt. A favourite pug- 
-dog was then allowed to commence his operations upon the 
breast, but so thick was the skin, and so solid the flesh, tiiat 
he, after much labour, found himself foiled, as his mistress 
had been before him. On the following day the plaintifl' 
applied to the defendant, sending back the fiagmenis of the 
young chicken, and desiring to have her money back again; 
but the defendant positively refused either to receive back 
bis property, or to refund the money he had received ; upou 
which refwsa!, the plaintiff summoned him. 



PREFACE. 

with tliese they toddle home in triumph, cackling all llie 
way, like a goose that has got ankle deep into good luct. 

. Mrs, Howard's servant corroborated her statement, asul 
added, that defendant, as he was quitting the house, desired 
her to boil the fowl double the time her mistress told lier, 
because it was a large one. It was accordingly boiled move 
than double the usual time. 

The defendant did not attempt to deny that the fowl was 
an old one, but said, he was himself deceived by the person 
of whom he purchased it, and the plaintiff having seen it be- 
fore she paid for it, could not complain of any imposition 
being practised upon her. 

The Court, however, dtcided that the defendant should re- 
fund the four shillings, and pay all the costs. It was plain, 
that when he sold the fowl he was aware of the imposition he 
was practising. He had given evidence of this himself, by der 
siring the servant to boil it longer than the usual time. At 
the same lime, however, that the Court thus gave judgment 
against the defendant, they could not avoid censuring, to a 
certain extent, the plaintiff, and ali those who encouraged 
persons of the defendant's description, by dealing with them. 
Little doubt could exis^ in the mind of any one, that most of 
the fowls thus hawked about the streets were stolen, at least by 
those who sold them to the hawkers; and nvhilst the thieves 
could find so ready a market for their plunder, there was 
little chance that the robbing of fowl-houses would be put 
an end to. 

The defendant being informed, that unless the debt and 
costs were immediately paid, an execution would forthwith 
issue against him, paid the sum demanded, and departed.

PREFACE. 

. If you have a well-ventilated larder, iu a shady, di y 
situation, you will ensure nuich credit to yourself by 
ordering in your meat and poultry such a time before 
you want it as will render it tender, which the finest 
meat cannot be, unless hung a proper time ; (see obser- 
vations on roasting ;) longer or shorter, according to the 
season and nature of the meat, &c., but always till it 
has made some advance towards putrefaction I The ten- 
dency to that takes place the moment that life is extin- 
guished. The allowing this process to proceed to a cer- 
tain degree, renders the nveat more easy of solution in 
the stomach, without diminishing the nutritious quality 
of it. Before yoii go to market* look over your larder, 
and it will save you much time and trouble to make 
out a list of the several articles you want, because when 
once your kitchen business is begun, you must never 
leave off till it is finished : if you have forgotten any 
article indispensable for the day's dinner, request your 
employers to send one of the servants for it: the cook 
must never quit her post till her work is complete. 

It is not expected that the most expert artist can per- 
form his work in a perfect manner, without a sufficient 
number of proper instruments : you cannot have neat 
work without nice tools; nor can your victuals be well 
dressed without an apparatus appropriate to the work

ADVICE TO COOKS. 



On your first coming into a family, lose no time in im- 
mediately getting into the good graces of your fellow- 
servants, that you may learn from them the customs of 
the kitchen, and the various rules and orders of the 
house; especially take care to be on good terms with 
the servant who waits at table ; you will then hear how 
your work has pleased in the parlour, and be enabled 
to rectify any mistake: also request the favour of an in- 
terview with your employers, and beg of them to ex- 
plain to you, as fully as possible, how they like their 
victuals dressed, whether much or little done, and of 
what complexion they wish the roasts, of a gold 
colour, or well browned, and if they like them frothed ; 
of the soups and sauces, do they like them thick or 
thin, pr white or brown, clean or full in the mouth, 
and what flavours they fancy, especially of spice and 
herbs ; for it is impossible the most accomplished cook 
can please their palates, till she has first learned tlieir 



ADVICE TO COOKS. 

particular taste* : always avoid over-dressing, or over- 

* " De gustibus non est disputandum." Tastes are as d if-' 
ferent as faces, and witliout a most attentive observation of 
the directions given by her employers, the most experienced 
cook will never get any credit: It will not go far to pacify the 
rage of a ravenous gourtnand, who likei his mutton chop 
broiled till its juice is quite dried up, to be told that some of 
the customers at Dolly's chop-house choose to have thejn only 
half done, and that this is the best way of eating them : I be- 
lieve we all think that is the best way which we relish best, 
and which agrees best with our stomachs : in this, reason and 
fashion, all powerful as they are on most occasions, yield to 
the imperative caprice of the palate. 

" The Irishman loves usquebaugh; the Scot loves ale, 
called blue cap ; 

" The Welshman he loves toasted cheese, and makes his 
mouth like a mouse trap." 

Our Italian neighbours now eat many things we think car« 
rion. Vide Ray's Travels, page 362 and 406. While the 
Englishman boasts of his beef, the Frenchman dresses his 
favourite frog and soup, the Tartar feasts on horseflesh, and the 
Chinaman on dogs ; and what at one time, or in one country, 
is considered as beautiful, fragrant, or savoury, is at another 
time or place regarded as deformed and disgustful*.

save you infinite trouble and anxiety if you can prevail 
on your employers to use the " sauce-box, " No. 4G3, 
hereinafter described in the chapter of sauces. With the 
help of this *' delicious magazine of taste " every one in 
company may flavour their soup and sauce, and adjust 
the vibrations of their palate, exactly to their own 
fancy : if the cook give a decided predominant and 
piquante flavour to a dish, to tickle the tongue of two 
or three visitors whose taste she knows, perhaps she 
may thereby make the dinner disgusting to all the other 
guests. Never undertake more work than you are 
quite certain you can do to perfection ; and if you are 
ordered to prepare a larger dinner than you think you 
can send up with ease and neatness, or dress any dish 
you are not acquainted! with, rather than run the risk 
of spoiling a single dish, by which, perhaps, you may 
lose all your credit, request your employers to let you 
have some help, for it requires no small care and con-

trivance to have all things done as they sliould be, and 
all hot together, and 

" A feast must be without a fault ; 

And, if 'tis not all right, 'tis nauglit." 
But 

'' Good nature must some failings overlook, 

Forgive mischance, not errors of the cook ; 

As, if no salt is thrown about the dish, 

Or nicecrisp'd parsley scatter'd on the fish; 

Shall we in passion from our dinner fly, 

And hopes of pardon to the cook deny. 

For things which Mrs. Glasse herself wight oversee, 

And all mankind commit as well as she?" 

Vide King's Art of Cookery, . 

Take care to begin your business betimes, or it will 

be impossible to have your dinner ready at the time it is 

ordered* : to be half an hour after the time, is so frequent 

* In a note of invitation to dinner, five o'clock seems to be 
generally understood to mean at six ; five precisely, halfpast five ; 
and five most precisely, (so that dinner may be on the table 
within ten minutes after,) five o'clock exactly, (allowing this for 
the variation of watches.) If the guests have any respect 
for their host, or prefer a zcell-dressed dinner to one that 
is spoilt, instead of coming half an hour after, they zcill 
take care to make their appearance before the time 
appointed : the dinner that would have been most excellent 
at five, must be uneatable if not sent to table till halfpast 
five : the operations of the cook are governed by the clock, 
and the moment the roasts, &c. are ready, they must go to 
table, if they are to be eaten in perfection. It is the least

a fault, that there is the more merit attached in being 
ready at the appointed hour*. This is certainly some- 
times a rather difficult task to perform ; and in the best 
regulated families you can only be sure of your time 
by thus properly arranging your business f.

punishment that a blundering ill-bred Booby can receirCj who 
comes half an hour after the time he teas bidden, to find the 
soup removed, and the fish cold. 

* Those who desire regularity in the service of their table, 
should have a DIAL, of not less than twelve inches diameter, 
placed over the kitchen fire-place, carefully regulated, to keep 
lime exactly with the clock in the hall or dining parlour ; with; 
a frame on one side, containing a taste table, or the pecu- 
liarities of the master's palate, and the particular rules and 
orders of his kitchen; and on the other side, of the rewards 
given to those who attend to them,, and for long service. 

•f With all our love of punctuality, we must not forget t?iat 
the first consideration must still be, that the dinner " be well 
done when 'tis done." If any accident occurs, which is likely 
to prevent your sending the soup, &c. to table at the mo- 
ment it is expected, send up a message to your employers, 
stating the circumstance, and bespeak their patience for as 
many minutes as you think you shall want to be ready. 
This is certainly better than either keeping the company 
waiting without any apology, or dishing your dinner before it 
is done epough, and so disgusting the stomachs of the guests 
at the first appearance of it. 



ADVICE TO COOKS. 

When you have a very large enterlainoient to pre- 
pare, first attend to your broths and gravies for your 
soups and sauces, and by all means get these ready 
the day before. The pastry, jellies, c^c. you may 
prepare while the broths are doing; then truss your 
game and poultry, and trim and shape your collops, 
cutlets, &c., and put them in plates, and arrange 
them upon the dresser in regular order: next see that 
your roasts and boils are all nicely trimmed, trussed, 
and singed, and quite ready for the spit or the pof. 
Get all your vegetables neatly cut, pared, picked, and 
clean washed in the cullender: provide a tin dish to 
hold your fine herbs ; onions and shallots, parsley, 
marjoram, thyme, tarragon, chervil, and buniet, 
minced vtry fine, and Lemon-peel grated, or cut thin, 
and chopped very small, pepper and salt ready mixed, 
and your spicebox * and salt-seller always at hand, so 

* In one drawer under your spice-box keep ready ground, 
in two ounce stopper bottles, the several spices, separate; and 
also that mixture of tiiem we have called " llagout Powder;'' 
in another keep your dried and powdered sweet savoury and 
soup-herbs, &c., and a set of weights and scales : you may 
have a third drawer, containing your flavouring essences, &c., 
an invaluable auxiliary in finishing soups and sauces: (see the 
account of the " Magazine of Taste," or " Sauce-Box," 
No. 463, in the chapter on sauces :) have also ready some 
thickening, made of the best white flour sifted, mixed with 
soft water with a wooden spoon till it is the consistence of 
thick batter, a bottle of plain browning, and a bottle of 
strained lemon-juice. 



ADVICE TO COOKS. 

lliiit every thing you want may be ready for your stove- 
work, and you need not be scampering about the 
kitchen, hunting after these trifles, while the dinner is 
waiting : nothing can be done in perfection, that must 
be done in a hurry ; therefore, if you wish the dinner 
to be sent up to please your master and mistress, and 
do credit to yourself, set a high value on your charac- 
ter for punctuality: this shows the establishment is 
orderly, is extremely gratifying to the master and his 
guests, and most praiseworthy in the attendants. 

*' But, remember, you cannot obtain this desirable rc- 
" putation without good management in every respect? 
" and if you wish to ensure ease and comfort in the lat- 
** ter part of your life, you must not be unwilling to pay 
*' the price for which only they can be obtained, and 
** earn them by a diligent and faithful performance of 
'* the duties of your station in your young days, which, 
" if you steadily persevere in, you may depend upon 
'* ultimately receiving the reward your services deserve. 

*' Quiet steady perseverance is the only sure spring to 
" infallibly promote your progress on the road to inde- 
*' pendence : and if your employers do not immediately 
*' appear to be sensible of your endeavours to contribute 
" your utmost to their comfort and interest, be not 
** easily discouraged, persevere steadily in the right 
" path; patiently and conscientiously attend to your 
" duties; and those you serve must soon discover the 
" inestimable value of such a faithful and intelligent 
** prime minister in their kitchen.'^ 



TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. 



To reduce our culinary operatiou^ to as exact a 
certainty as the nature of ifie processes would admit 
of, we have, wherever it was needful, given the 
quantities of each article. — The weighls, avoirdupoise. 
— Tke measure. The h'quid graduated measure of the 
apothecaries, as it appeared more accurate and con- 
venient than any other, the pint being divided into 
sixteen ounces, the ounce into eight drachms : a mid- 
dling size teaspoon will contain about a drachm ; four 
such teaspoons are equal to a middling size, large, or 
tablespoon, or half an ounce ; four tablespoons, to a 
common-sized wineglass. The specific gravities of 
the various substances being so extremely different, 
we cannot offer any auxiliary standards* for the 
weights, which we earnestly recommend the cook to 
employ, if she wishes to gain credit for accuracy 
and uniformity in her business : these she will iind it 
necessary to have as small as the quarter of a drachm 
avoirdupoise, which is equal to nearly seven grains 
troy weight. 

* A large tablespoonful of flour weighs about half a;i ounce. 



TABLE OF WEIGHTS AND MEASURES. 

Glass measures, divided into tea and table spoons, 
and containing from an ounce to half a pint, nia^ be 
bad at Hancock's Glass Warehouse, Charing Cross; 
and at Prick's, near Exeter Change, Strand; ^vhere 
may also be had double-headed pepper and spice 
boxes, with caps o\er the gratings. The superiority of 
these, by preserving the contents from the action of 
the air, must be sufficiently obvious to every^ one : the 
fine flavour of Cayenne pepper is soon lost, from the 
bottles it is usually kept in not being well stopped.

THE 

COOK'S ORACLE. 



BOILING. 

GENERAL RULES. 



This most simple of culinary processes is not 
often performed in perfection. Boiling requires 
less nicety and attendance than roasting ; and to 
skim your pot ^vell, and keep it really boiling (the 
slower the better) all the while, and to know how 
long is required for doing the joint, &c, com- 
prehends almost the whole art and mystery. This? 
however, requires a patient and perpetual vigi- 
lance, of which few persons are capable. — The 
cook must take care that the water really boils all 
the while she is cooking, or she will be deceived 
in the time ; and she should make up a sufEcient 
iire at first, to last all the time, without much 
mending or stirring. As it is coming to a boil. 



BOILING. 

there will always, from the cleanest meat and 
clearest water, rise a scum to the top of the pot : 
this proceeds partly from the foulness of the meat, 
and partly from the water, and must be carefully 
taken off as soon as it rises : if you neglect this, 
and suffer it to boil, the scum will fall, and stick 
to the meat. On this depends the appearance 
of all boiled things. When you have scummed 
well, throw in some cold water and a little salt, 
which will throw up the rest of the scum. The 
oftener it is scummed, and the cleaner the top 
of the water is kept, the cleaner will be the meat. 
If let alone, it soon boils down, and sticks to 
the meat*; which, instead of looking delicately 
white and nice, will have that coarse and filthy 
appearance we have too often to complain of, 
and the butcher and poulterer get blamed for 
the carelessness of the cook in not scumming her 
pot. Many put in milk, to make what they boil 
look white ; but this does more harm than good : 
others wrap it up in a cloth ; but this is needless, 
and better let alone ; if the scum be attentively 
removed, it will have a colour and flavour that 



* If, unfortuntitely, this should happen, the cook must 
carefully take it off when she dishes up, either with a clean 
sponge or a paste-brush. 



BOILING. 

it never has when muffled up. It is the best 
way to take out all the dirt, not to defend the 
meat against it. 

Put jour meat into plenty of cold* water, not 
less than a quart to a pound, so that it may get 
gradually warm through before the outside gets 
hard : begin to reckon the time from its first 
coming to a boil. The old rule of 15 minutes 
to a pound of meat we think rather too little; 
for the slower it boils, the tenderer, plumper, 
and whiter it will be. From 20 to 30 minutes 
to a pound will not be found too much for gentle 
boiling by the side of the fire ; allowing more 
or less time, according to the thickness of the 
joints ; always remembering, the slower it boils 
the better. 

Meat will take, rather longer time boiling in 
cold than it wants in warm weather; and, if 
frozen, must be thawed before boiling as before 
roasting, by laying some time in cold water : or, 
two or three hours before you dress it, bringing 
it into a place the temperature of which is not less 
than fifty degrees of Fahrenheit's thermometer. 

* Cooks, however, as well as doctors, disagree ; for some 
say, that " all sorts of fresh meat should be put in when the 
water boils." I prefer the above method, for the reason 
given.

BOILING. 



Leg of Mutton, (No. 1.) 

Cut off the shank bone and trim the knuckle of 
a leg of mutton, and put it into lukewarm water for 
an hour; wash it clean, put it on in plenty of 
cold water; let it boil gently; and skim it carefully. 
A leg of nine pounds will take three hours boiling. 

Nech of Mutton, (No. 2.) 

Put four or five pounds of the best end of the 
neck into a gallon and a half of water, and let it 
simmer slowly for two hours; it will eat most 
deliciously tender: it will look most delicate if 
you do not take off the skin till it has been boiled. 
Caper sauce and turnips, or spinage, are expected 
to accompany boiled mutton. 

To Boil Lamb, (No. 3.) 

Lamb will take quite as much time in boiling as 
mutton, and is managed in the same way. After 
the observations on boiling, which commence this 
chapter of our work, we have nothing to add. 

To Boil Veal, (No. 4.) 
As this is always expected to come to table look-

ing very delicately clean, &c., you must be care- 
ful to have clean water and a clean vessel, and 
constantly catch the scum, and attend to the 
directions before given in the preliminary observa- 
tions. Send up bacon and greens, and parsley 
and butter, with it. 

Beef BGuiilie, (No. 5.) 

In plain English, is understood to mean boiled 
beef; but its culinary acceptation, is fresh beef 
dressed without boiling, but kept gently simmer- 
ing over a slow fire. English cooks seem to have 
no notion that good soup can be made without 
destroying a great deal of meat : however, by a 
judicious regulation of the fire, and a vigilant 
attendance on the soup kettle, this may be accom- 
plished without much difficulty, and you shall 
have a tureen of such soup as the finest palate will 
be pleased with, and the meat make its appearance 
at table possessing its full portion of nutritious 
succulence. This requires nothing more than to 
boil or rather stew the meat slowly, instead of 
fast, and to take it up when it is done enough. 
Meat cooked in this manner affords more than 
double the nourishment it does dressed in the 
common way, is easy of digestion in proportion 
as it is tender, and an invigorating diet, especial- 
ly valuable to the poor, whose laborious employ- 
ments require support, which if they could derive 
from good eating being put within their reach, 
they would -often go to the butcher's shop, when 
they now run to the public house. Our neigh- 
bours the French are so justly famous for their 
skill in the affairs of the kitchen, that, as the adage 
b4: 



BOJLING. 

says, *' as many Frenchmen so many cooks;" 
.surroLinded as they are by a prolusion of the 
most delicious wines and most seduciJig liqueurs, 
offering every temptatioii and facility to render 
drunkenness delightful, a tippling Frenchman is a 
*' rara avis :" they know how so easily and com- 
pletely to keep Ufe in repair by good eating, 
they require little or no adjustment from drinking. 
Tliis accounts for that " toujours gai," and happy 
equilibrium of spirits which they enjoy with more 
regularity than any people : the elasticity of their 
stomachs, unimpaired by spirituous liquors, em- 
brace and digest vigorously the food they saga- 
ciously prepare for it, wliich they render easily 
assimilable by cooking it sulficiently, wisely con- 
trivin<r to o^et half the work of the stomach done 
by tire and water. 

See Receipt for Soup and Bouillie, No. 23%. 

To salt Beef and Pork. (No. 6.) 

Before you salt meat, remember to take out the 
kernels : there is always one in the udder of a 
round of beef, and one in tlie fat in the middle of 
the round, and several about the thick end of the 
ilank, and another in the mouse buttock ; and if 
they are not taken out, all the salt in the world 
will not keep the meat. 

The great art of salting meat is to rub in the 
salt thoroughly and evenly into every part, and to 
fill all the holes full of salt where the kernels 
■were taken out, and where the butcher's skewers 
were : a round of beef of 40 pounds will take a 
pound and a quarter of salt to be rubbed in all at 
first, and turn it and rub it every day with the 



BOlLrXG.- 

brine: it will be ready for dressing" in eiiilil or fen 
days, if you do not wish it very salt. In summer, 
salt your meat as soon as ii comes in, and take 
care to defend it from the flies. In winter, it w ill 
eat the shorter and tenderer if kept three or four 
days before it is salted ; and in frosty weather 
v;arm the salt in a frj-in^^ pan, and rub it on the 
meat while it is hot. if you wish it to look red, 
rub it with saltpetre and bay salt, in the propor- 
tion of two ounces of each of these to half a pound 
of common salt. 

An H-bone will require about half a pound of 
salt to be well rubbed into it, and avIU be ready in- 
four or five days, if turned and rubbed every day. 

Pork requires a longer time to cure it (in pro- 
portion to its weight) than beef, and a leg of pork 
should be in salt eight or ten days. 

Salted meat should always be well washed 
before it is boiled, especially if it has been in salt 
long, that the liquor the meat is boiled in, may 
not be too salt to make soup of. If your meat has 
been in salt a long time, and you think it will be 
too salt, lay it in water the night before yoa 
intend to dress it. 



To Boil a Round of salted Beef. (No, 7.) 

This is generally too large for a moderate family, 
so we shall write directions for the dressing half a> 
round. 

Skewer it up as tight and as round as possible, 
andlie a fillet of broad tape round it, to k^ep the 
skevvers in their places. Put it into plenty of cold 
water, and carefully catch the scum as it rises; 
let it boil till all the scum is removed, and thrc-

put the boiler on one side of the fire to keep 
simmering till it is done. Half a round of SOlbs. 
will take near three hours ; if it weighs more, 
give it more time. When you take it up, wash 
it well with a paste brush, and garnish the dish 
with carrots : send up carrots, turnips, and pars- 
nips, or greens, on separate dishes. Pease pud- 
ding is very good with it. 

H-Boue of Beef (No. 8.) 

Is to be managed in exactly the same manner 
as the round, but will be sooner boiled, as it is not so 
«olid : an H-bone of SOlbs. will be enough in about 
two hours and a half, and H-bones of lOlbs. in two. 
Be sure the boiler is big enough to allow it plenty 
of water-room ; for the more water it is boiled in, 
the better it will look, and the tenderer it will eat. 

Ohs. — In '^ Mrs Mason's Ladies' Assistant" 
this joint is called haunch-bone ; in " Henderson's

Ribs of Beef salted and rolled, (No. 9.) 

Briskets, and the various other pieces, are dress- 
ed in the same way. Wow ^\ o w sauce (No. 3^8) 
is an agreeable companion to them. 

To Boil a Calfs Head (No. 10.) 

' Take out the brains, then wash the head well in 
several waters, and let it lie in soak in warm water 



BOILING. 

for an hour before you dress it. Tie the brains 
up in a cloth with half a dozen sage-leaves, put 
them with the head into a kettle with plenty of 
cold water: when it is comino^ to a boil, and the 
scura rises, carefully remove it : when the meat at 
the neck-end is tender, it is done enough. Haifa 
calf's head, without the skin on, will take from an 
hour and three quarters to two hours and a quar- 
ter, according to its size ; with the skin on, about 
half an hour longer. Chop the brains with the 
sage-leaves that were boiled with them, and send 
them to table on a separate dish, with the tongue 
(peeled), and cut down the middle, laid on each 
side of them. This dish is usually attended by 
bacon or pickled pork, and greens, cauliflowers, 
or peas, and always parsley and butfer. No. 261. 
If you like it full dressed, beat up the yolk of 
an egg, and rub it over the head with a feather ; 
powder it with a seasoning of dried and powdered 
lemon thyme, parsley, pepper, and salt, and bread 
crumbs, and give it a brown with a salamander, or 
in a tin Dutch oven : when it begins to dry 
sprinkle a little melted butter over it with a paste 
brush. You may garnish the dish with broiled 
rashers of bacon laid round it. 

Obs. — Calf's head is one of the most delicate 
and favourite dishes in the list of boiled meats; 
but nothing is more insipid wIk n cold : and again, 
nothing makes so nice a hash : therefore, al- 
ways save a quart of the liquor your head was 
boiled in, to niRke sauce, &c. for the hash. Cut 
it into slices about a quarter of an inch thick, 
flour them, and lay them ready on a plate : take tbe 
bones of the head and the trimmings, a quarter 
of a pound of bacon cut into slices^ (some of that

>vhich v/as dressed to eat with the calf s head 
when hot, will do,) a bundle of sweet herbs, a

these into a saucepan with the quart of liquor you 
have saved, and let it stew for an hour and a half ; 
then put half an ounce of bn(ter into another 
stewpan : when it is melted, add a table spoonful 
of flour to it, stir it well together, and by degrees 
add to it the gravy you have made with the 
bones and trimmings, siraining it through a hair 
sieve: season it with a glass of white wine, and 
a table spoonful of ketchup ; give it a boil up, 
skim it, and then put in the calf's head and 
bacon to warm, (it must not boil after,) and it 
is ready. 

N.B. You may garnish the edges of the dish 
with slices of bacon toasted in a Dutch oven,, 
and slices of lemon. 



Pickled Pork (No. 11.) 

Eequires more time than any meat. AV hen yon 
cook a leg, which, when well dressed, is a favourite 
dish with almost every body, take care it does 
not boil fast ; if it does, the knuckle will break to 
pieces before the thick part of the meat is warm 
through : a leg of seven pounds will take nearly 
three hours. 

If not doue enough, nothing is more disagree- 
able: if boiled too long, it loses not only its flavour, 
but its substance becomes soft like a jelly. It 
can never appear at table without a good pease 
pudding, and, if you please, turnips and greens, 
&c. and remember not to forget your mustard 
pot. 



BOILING. : 

Pigs Pettitoes. (No. 12.) 

Put a thin slice of bacon at the bottom of a 

stcwpan, ^vith some broth, a blade of mace, a j 

bay-leaf, a few peppercorns, and a bit of thyme : ^ 
boil tlie iiici till they are quite tender: this will 

take full twenty minutes : but the heart, liver, i 

and lights, will be done enough in ten', when i 

they are to be taken out, and minced fine. i 

Put them into a stewpan with a little gravy, • 
tliicken it with a little butter rolled in flour, 
season it witli a little pepper and salt, set it over 

a gentle fire; let them simmer for five minutes, ■ 
shaking them about very often. 

While this is doing, have a thin slice of bread \ 

toasted very lightly, divide it into sippets, and | 

lay them round the dish : pour the mince and ; 

sauce into the middle of it, and split the feet and ; 

lay them round it. ! 

N'B, The pettitoes are sometimes fried in : 

batter. i 

Ohs. — If you have no graA-y in the water i 

you stew the pettitoes in, put an onion, a sprig \ 

of lemon thyme, or sweet marjoram, with a blade ! 

of bruised mace, a few black peppers, and a large ; 

tea-spoonful of lemon pickle; and you will have | 

a very tolerable substitute for gravy. j 

Bacon. (No. 13.) | 

Put a pound of nice streaked bacon into two . 
quarts of boiling water, and let it boil quick for '■■ 
SO or 40 minutes ; take it up, scrape the under ! 
side well, and cut off the rind : grate a crust of ■ 
bread over it, and put it before the fire for a few

minutes; it must not be there loo long, or it will 
dry it too much and spoil it 

Two pounds will require an bonr, three pounds 
an hour and a half; the liock or gammon being 
very thick, will take full a quarter of an hour to a 
pound more. 

Hrm, (No. 14) 

Though of the bacon kind, has been so altered 
and hardened in the particular way of curing, 
it requires a very different manner of dressing. 

it is generally not half soaked, as salt as brine, 
and hard as fiint : if it is very dry, it must be 
soaked from 12 to 24 hours : scrape it clean, 
trim it neatly, and put it into lukewarm water, 
•which will help to mellow it very much. Give 
it plenty of water; a copper is the best thing to 
boil it in ; put it in while the water is cold, and 
manage the fire so that it may be three or four 
hours before it boils : to prevent this, put in a 
little cold water occasionally, but do not put in so 
much at a time as to prevent its simmering ; keep 
scumming it carefully all the time : then stir up 
your f.jc, and make the water boil slowly, and 
a middling sized ham will be finished in an hour 
and a half; a large one in two hours, or a very 
little more ; and it will be very clean, and eat very 
tender. 

Pall off the skin carefully, so as to preserve it 
as whole as possible, as it will form an excellent 
covering to keep the ham moist : when you have 
removed the skin, rub some bread raspings through 
a hair sieve, or grate a crust of bread over it.

BOILING. 

Tongue. (No. 15.) 

A Tongue is so hard, whether prepared by drying 
or pickling, that it requires much more time, &c. 
than a ham : nothing, of its weight, takes so long 
to dress it properly. 

A tongue that has been salted and dried, should 
be put to soak 24 hours before it is wanted, in a 
large quantity of water : a green tongue fresh from 
the pickle requires soaking only a few hours ; they 
take nearly the sametimedressing. Let your tongue 
be put into plenty of cold water, and give it from 
three and a half to four hours very slow simmering, 
according to its size : about half an hour before it is 
done, take it up, peel it, and put it into the pot 
again io finish it ; scum the pot frequently uhile 
it is doing, and it will come out tender and clean. 
It is a general rule with some cooks to try if the 
tongue will peel, and then allow it half an hour 
after that. 



Toxvls, (No. IG.) 

Under this title we include all the kinds of tame 
fowls, from the turkey to the chicken : they are 
all boiled exactly in the same manner, and accord- 
ing to the same rules, only allowing time, accord- 
ing to the size. For stuffings, «&c. see No. S74 
and 377. 

Turkies, and large fowls, should always have 
the strings or sinews of the thighs drawn out. 

Fowls for boiling should be chosen as white as 
possible : those which have even black-legs had 
better be roasted. 



BOfLING. 

Make a good and ckar fire ; set on a clean poty 
with plenty of pure and clear water, the more the 
better; and the slower it boils the whiter and 
j>lumper the fowl will be. You may rub a 
lemon over the breast of your fowl, and put it in. 
When there rises any scum, the common method 
of some who are more nice than wise, is to wrap 
them up in a cloth, to prevent the scum attaching 
to them ; which if it does, by your neglecting- to 
skim your pot, there is no getting it off afterwards, 
and the pMuiierer is blamed for the fault of the 
cook. However, if there be water enough, and 
it is attentively scummed, the fowl will both look 
and eat much better this way than when it has 
been tied up in the cleanest cloth ; and both the 
colour and flavour of your poultry will be preser- 
ved in the most charming and delicate perfection. 



Rabbits. (No. 17.) 

Truss your rabbits short, put them info plenty of 
water, and boil them half an hour; if large ones, 
three quarters; smother them with onion sauce, 
and send up liver sauce in a boat. 



Tripe. (No. 18.) 

Cut the tripe into pieces about two inches broad 
and four long ; put it into a stewpan of clean 
boiling water, and let it boil half an hour; then 
liave another clean stewpan with an equal quantity 
of milk and water ; when this boils, take the tripe 
out of the water, and put it into the milk and 
water. 



BOILING. i 

Boil (by themselves) some Spanish, or the : 
whitest common onions you can get ; when they 

are tender, drain them in a hair sieve, and put i 

them to the tripe in a tureen or soup-dish : take [ 

oft' the fat if any floats on the surface ; but tripe j 

dressed in this way is seldom greasy. i 

Obs. — Rashers of bacon are a very good ac- j 

com paniraent to boiled tripe. •

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 



In all studies, it is the best practice to begin ^^ith | 

the phiincst and easiest parts ; and so proceed, ; 

by degrees, to sucli as are more difficult: we, i 

therefore, first treat of plain boiling and roasting* j^ , 

♦ The muscular flesh of animals, which is the subject of j 

culinarv operations, is composed of many elements. A nice ; 

discrimination of these parts is by no means necessary for i 
our present purpose ; it will be sufficient to point out, that of 

muscular flesh one part becomes coagulated at the boiling \ 
heat of '212'^' of Fahrenheit, and resembles, in its properties, the 

\vhite of an egg; it has, therefore, been called albumen, j 

Another component part is the animal glue or jelly, termed '■ 

gelatin; and the other is the coloured ju'^ce contained within ; 

the smaller vessels, which, in compliance with custom, we ; 
denominate gravy. In the preparation of food by hoilinc; 

and roasting, the albumen is coagulated : the same effect \ 

takes place in the drawing of gravy. In this latter operation i 

the gelatin and fluids contained m the smaller vessels are ! 
extracted; and the albumen, coagulated wi-ii the hbrous 

matter, remains. j 

It will be evident, from this statement, tliat roasted meat . j 



ROASTING. 

and shall then gradually unravel, to our culinary 
students, the art and (until we candidly and 
clearly develop it in this "work) mystery of 
making, ^vith the least trouble and expense, the 
most delicious and highly finished made-dishes. 

Let the young cook never forget that clean- 
liness is the first cardinal virtue of the kitchen ; 
and, as the first preparation for Roasting, take 
care that the spit be properly cleaned with sand 
and water ; nothing else. When it has been 
well scowered with this, dry it with a clean clotii. 
If spits are wiped clean as soon as the meat is 
drawn from them, and while they are hot, a very 
little cleaning will be required. The less the spit 
runs through the meat the better^' ; and take espe- 
cial care it be evenly balanced on the spit, that 
its motion may be regular, and the fire operate 

is more nutritious than boiled; because, at the boiling heat, 
a great quantity of the gelatinous part is extracted by the 
water. 

* As many small families have not the convenience of 
roasting with a spit, a remark upon roasting by a string is 
necessary. — Let the cook, before she puts her meat down to 
the fire, pass a strong skewer through each end of the joint: by 
this means, when it is about half done, she can with ease turn 
the bottom upwards ; the gravy will then flow to the part 
which has been uppermost, and the whole joint cut and eat 
most delicately. 



ROASTINO. 

equally on each part of it; therefore be provided i 
with balancing skewers. j 

All your attention in roasting will be thrown j 
away if you do not take care that your meat I 
lias been kept long enough to be tender*. The 
only way to make sure of tliis, is to have it home, 
and hang it up in your own larder. If you have 
not a good airy place for tliis purpose, bespeak 
your n^eat and poultrj^ three or four days before 
you wish to dress it. Examine it, before you spit 
it, that it is properly jointed. The cook as often 
loses her credit by meat being dressed too fresb, 
as by fish that is too stale. Dr. Franklin, in his 
philosophical experiments, tells us, that game or 
poultry, &c. killed by electricity, may be dressed 
immediately, and will be deliciously tender. 

Make up the fire in time, and let it be pro- 
portioned to the dinner to be dressed, and about 
four inches longer at each end than the thing to 
be roasted. The chemists talk of their several 

* The time meat should hang depends entirely on the 
degree of heat and humidity of the air: if not kept long 
enough, it is hard and tough ; if too long, it loses its flavour : 
it should hang where it will have a thorough air, and dry it 
well with a cloth night and niorning, to keep it from growing 
damp and musty. When you dress it, pare off the QutsideS;^ 
as they sometimes get a bad taste.

ticular to proportion her fire to the business she 
Las to do. 

The iire tliat is but just sufficient to receive 
the noble sirloin, ^vill parch up a lighter joint. 
Proportion the solidity of your fire to the size 
of your joint ; and from half an hour to an hour 
before it is necessary to put it down to roast, 
prepare the fire by putting a few coals on, wliich 
will be sufficiently burnt by the time you wish to 
make use of your fire ; rake out the bottom, 
and press it down so as to make the fire solid and 
good ; between the bars and on the top put 
small round coal or large round coals, according 
to the bulk of the joint, and the time the fire is 
required to be strong; aft^r which, throw all your 
cinders (wetted) at the back. Never put j^our 
meat down to a burnt-up fire if you can possibly 
avoid it ; but should it be so, that having a large 
dinner to cook the fire is become fierce, be sure to 
place the spit at a considerable distance, and 
allow your meat a little more time. Always pre- 
serve the fat by covering it with paper ; keep by 
you, for this purpose, paper called ^' kitchen 
paper," and fine twine to tie it on : pins and 
skewers can by no means be allowed, as they are 
so many taps to let out the gravy of your meat ; 
besides, the paper with the heat of the fire often

starts from them and catches light, to the great 
injury of the meat. 

If the thing to be roasted be thin and tender, 
the fire should be little and brisk ; and when you 
have a large joint to roast, make up a sound, 
strong fire ; it must be equally good in every part 
of the grate, especially at the ends, or your meat 
cannot be equally roasted, nor have that uniform 
colour on every part of it, which constitutes the 
beauty of good roasting. 

Give tlie fire a good stirring before you lay the 
joint down, examine it every quarter of an hour 
while the spit is going round ; keep it clear at the 
bottom, and take care there are no smoky coals in 
the front of it, which will spoil the look and taste 
of the meat, and hinder it from roasting evenly. 
When the joint to be roasted is thicker at one end 
than the other, place the spit slanting, so that the 
whole time the thickest part is nearest the fire, and 
also the thinnest by this means is preserved from 
being overmuch roasted. 

Take care not to put your meat too near the fire ; 
the larger the joint, the farther it must be kept 
from the fire*; for if once it gets scorched, the 

* From 14 to 10 inches seem to be about the distance meat 
is generally put from the grate when first put down : it is ex- 
tremely difficult to offer any thing like an accurate general rule 
for this, as it depends so much upon the size of the fire and of

outside Avill become hard, and acquire a disagree- 
able strong taste ; and the fire being prevented 
from penetrating into it, the meat will appear 
enough, before it is little more than half done, be- 
sides losing the pale brown colour which it is the 
greatest beauty of all roast meat to have. 

If you wish your jack to go well, keep it as 
clean as possible, oil it, and then wipe it ; as, if the 
oil is not wiped off again, it will gather dust: to 
prevent this, as soon as you have done with your 
jack cover it up. Never leave the winders on 
whilst the jack is going round, unless you do it, as 
Swift says, that it may fly off and knock those 
troublesome servants on the head, who will be 
crowding round your kitchen fire. 

Be very careful to place the drippingpan at 
such a distance from the fire, as just to catch the 
drippings : if it is too near, the ashes will fall into 
it, and spoil the drippings ;* (which, we shall here- 
thai of the thing to be roasted, till some culinary philosopher 
shall invent a thermometer to ascertain the degree of heat of 
the fire, and a gi-aduated spit rack to regulate the distance from 
it, the process of roasting must remain among those which can 
only be performed well by very frequent practice. 

* Which the good housewife ^vill take up occasionally, as by 
leaving it all in the dripping-pan until the meat is taken up, 
it not only becomes very strong, but when the meat is rich 
and yields much of it, it is apt to be spilt in basting. 



ROASTING, 

.nfter shew, will be found not only an excellent 
substitute, but for many purposes are decidedly 
superior to either butter or lard ;) if it is too far 
from the fire to catch them, you will not only 
lose your drippings, but the meat will be blackened 
and spoiled by the foetid smoke which will arise 
when the fat falls on the live cinders. 

The time meat will take roasting will vary 
according to the temperature of the weather : the 
same piece will be twenty minutes or half an hour 
longer in cold weather^- than it will be in warm. 

It k difficult to give any specific rule for time ; 
but if your fire is made as before directed, your 
meatskreen is sufficiently large to guard what you 
are dressing from currents of air, and the meat is not 
frosted f ? we cannot do better than recommend the 

* If the meat is frozen, put it into coW water till it is 
tliawed, then dry and roast it as usual; or bring it into tlie 
kitchen for two or three hours before you want to roast it, 
and the warm air will thaw it perhaps better than any otheF 
way.

they also answer all the purposes of a large Dutch oven, plate

old general rule of allowing a quarter of an hour to 
the pound ; a little more or less, in proportion as 
the piece is thick or thin, the strength of the 
fire, the nearness of the meat to it, and the 
frequency with which you baste it : the more it is 
basted, the less time it will take, as it keeps the 
meat soft and mellow on the outside, and the fire 
thereby acts with more force upon it. 

A large joint should be basted every quarter of 
an hour, till within half an hour of the time it is 
done. 

It is also a good general rule, when, your joint is 
half done, to remove the spit and drippingpan 
back, and stir up your fire thoroughly, that it 
may burn clear and bright for the browning : 
when the steam from the meat draws towards the 
fire*, it is a sign of its being done enough; but 
you will be the best judge of that from the time it 
has been down, the strength of the fire you have 
used, and the distance your spit has been from it.

they should be. The same, and all other kitchen and iron- 
mongery goods, are excellently well made by Brownley, Greek 
Street, Soho. 

* When the steam begins to arise, it is a proof that the 
whole joint is thoroughly saturated with heat: any unnecessary 
evaporation, is a waste of all the best nourishment of the meat;

Just before you take it up, baste it, and diedire

about the froth, you must use butter instead of

Thougli roast ins: is one of the most common, and 
is generally considered one of the most easy and 
simple processes of cookery, it requires more unre- 
mitting attention to perform it perfectly well, than 
it does to make m<?st made-dishes. 

That made-dishes are more ditticult, I think 
really deserves to be reckoned among the culi- 
nary vulgar errors : for in these the cook has 
nothing to do but follow the receipt, and cannot 
very easily fail : but in plain roastin^- and boiling 
it is Dot easy to repair a mistake once made ; and 
all the discretion and attention of a steady careful 
cook must be unremittingly upon the alert*. 

* A celebrated French writer has made the following ob&er- 
M»tions on roasting : 

*• The art of rxxistiug victuals to the pi-ecise degree, is one 
of the most dimcult in this world, and you may find a tliou- 
!iand good cooks sooner than one perfect roaster : (See " Alma- 
*icch dcs Gounnayids,*' vol. i. p. ST.") In the mansions of the 



ROASTING. 

A diligent attention to time, distance, basting 

opulent they have, besides the chief cook, a roaster, perfectly 
independent of the former. All erudite gourmands know these 
two important functions cannot be performed by one artist, and 
that it is quite impossible at the same time to direct the opera- 
tions of the spit, and the stewpan." — Further on the same 
author observes : " No certain rules can be given for roast- 
ing, the perfection of it depending on many circumstances 
which are continually changing ; the age, size, shape, and 
nature of the pieces, the quality of the coals, the temperature 
of the atmosphere, the currents of air in the kitchen, the more 
or less attention of the roaster; and, lastly, the time of serving. 
For supposing the dinner ordered to be on table at a certain 
time, if the fish and soup are much liked, and detained longer 
than the roaster has calculated ; or, on the contrary, if they 
are despatched sooner than is expected, the roasts will in one 
case be burnt up, in the other not done enough — two mis- 
fortunes equally to be deplored. The first, however, is without 
a remedy ; five minutes on the spit more or less, decides the 
goodness of this mode of cookery ; and it is almost impossible 
to seize the precise instant when it ought to be eaten ; which 
epicures in roasts express by saying, * It is done to a turn.* 
So it is that there is no exaggeration in saying, that the perfect 
roaster is even more rare than the professed cook. 

" In small families, where the cook is also the roaster, it is 
almost impossible the roasts should be well done ; the spit 
claims exclusive attention, and is an imperious mistress, who 
demands the entire de\otion of her slave. But how can this be ? 
When the cook is obliged at the same time to attend her fish 
and soup kettles, and watch her stewpans and all their accom-

all the general rules we can prescribe for roasting 

paniments, it is morally and physically impossible ; if she gives 
that delicate and constant attention to the roasts which they 
require, the rest of the dinner must often be spoilt; and most 
cooks will rather lose their character as a roaster, than neglect 
the made-dishes and * entremets,' &:c. where she thinks she 
can display her culinai-y science, than sacrifice these to the 
roast; the perfection of which^ she thinks, will only prove her 
steady vigilance and patience.

dredgings, as will be seen by the following quotation from

or fowl, by sea or land, and divers ways of breading or dredging

those who like their meat thoroughlj/ roasted* 



ROASTING. 



Sirloin of BEEF. (No. 19.) 

The noble sirloin of about fifteen pounds' will 
require to be before the fire about four hours : take 
care io spit it straight, that it may not be heavier 
on one side than the other ; put a little clean 
dripping into the drippingpan, tie a sheet of 
paper over it to preserve the flit*, and baste it 
■well as soon as it is put down, and baste it every 
quarter of an hour all the time it is roasting till 
the last half hour ; then take off the paper, stir the 
fire and make it clear : to brown and froth it, 
sprinkle a little salt over it, baste it with butter, 
and dredge it with flour ; let it go a few minutes 
longer till the froth rises, take it up, put it on the 
dish, &c. To make gravy for it, put a teaspoon- 
fnl of salt into half a pint of boiling water, and 
pour it over the underside of the meat, and 
through the hole the spit comes out of. Garnish 
with horseradish scraped as fine as possible with 
a very sharp knife, A Yorkshire pudding is an 
excellent accompaniment. (No. 595.) 

Obs. — The inside of the sirloin must never 
be cut hot, but reserved entire for the hash. 
y:(See some hints to housekeepers on this subject in 
the Receipt to Hash Beef J No. 506. 

* If there is more fat than you think will be eaten with the 
meat, cut it off, it will make an excellent pudding; or clarify 
it, and use it for frying. 



ROASTING. 



Ribs of Beef. (No. 20.) 

The three first ribs, of fifteen or twenty pounds, 
will take three hours and a half: the fourth and 
fiFth ribs will take as long, managed in the same 
way as the sirloin. Paper the fat, and the thin 
part, or it will be done too rauch^ before the thick 
part is done enough. 

Ribs of Beef boned and rolled. (Na 2 1 .) 

When you have kept two or three ribs of beef 
till quite tender, take out the bones, and skewer it 
as round as possible, (like a fillet of veal,) and 
bind it with tape to prevent the skewers breaking 
out : as the meat is more in a solid mass, it will 
require more time at the fire than in the preced- 
ing receipt ; and a piece often or twelve pounds 
weight will not be well and thoroughly roasted in 
less than three hours and three quarters. For the 
first half hour it should not be less than 12 inches 
from the fire, that ii may get gradually warm to 
the centre : the last half hour before it will be 
finished, take oft' the tape, sprinkle a little salt 
over it, and flour and froth it. 



Rttinp of Beef (No. 22.) 

Is very difficnlt to spit, and should have two 
strong skevvers tied on it to keep it steady ; their 
usual weight is from sixteen to twenty-four pounds ;

.-iiid the time they must be at the fire, from four 
hours to four and a half. 



Roast MUTTON. (No. 23.) 

As beef requires a large sound fire, mutton 
must have a brisk and fierce one : it is never well 
done unless the fire is quick and clear, and the 
mutton has been hung as long as it will keep *. 

A Leg. (No. 24.) 

A leg of eight pounds will take two hours and a 
quarter : let it be well basted and frothed, in the 
same manner as roast beef. 



Dean Swift's Receipt to Roast Mutton. 

" Gently stir and blow the fire, 
Lay the mutton down to roast, 

Dress it quickly I desire, 
In the dripping put a toast, 

That I hunger may remove, — 

Mutton is the meat I love. •

Oh ! the cliarming white and red \ 

Finer meat ne'er met the eye. 
On the s veetest grass it fed : 

Let the jack go swiftly round. 

Let me have it nicely brown'd. 

" On the table spread the cloth, 
Let the knives be sharp and clean, 

Pickles get and salad both, 
Let them each be fresh and green.

A Chine, (No. 9.5) 
{i, €. the two loins) or 

A Saddle, (No. 26.) 

(i.e. the two necks,) often or eleven pounds, two 
hours and a half: tie a sheet of paper over them : 
baste the strings you tie it on with directly, or 
they will burn ; and let the meat be well basted. 

A Shoulder, (No. 27.) 

Of seven pounds, an hour and a half : put the 
spit in close to the shank bone, and run it along 
the blade bone; take care to froth it nicely. 

A Loin* (No. 28.) 

Of mutton an hour and a half. The most elegant 
way of carving this, is to cut it lengthwise, as you 
do a saddle. 

A Neck, (No. 29.) 

An hour and a half. It must be carefully jointed, 
or it is very bad to carve. 

* Common cooks very seldom brown the ends of neck and 
loins : to have this done nicely, and in perfection, let the fire 
be a few inches longer at each end than the joint that is roasting, 
and occasionally place the spit slanting, so that each end may 
get sufficient fire : but nothing does this in such perfection 
as the concave reflectors before mentioned. This is much 
better than taking up the meat and putting it down before the 
fire to do the ends ; as, by the latter method, you camiot send it 
to table frothed.

you think will be eaten with the lean, cut it

J Breast, (No. 30.) 
An hour and a quarter. 

A Haunch, (No. 3 1 .) 

(/. e. the leg and part of the loin) of ran((on is 
spitted and managed in the same way as a haunch 
of Venison ; (see Receipt^ No. 63.) send up two 
sauce boats with it; one of the richest drawn gravy 
that can be made without spice or herbs; and the 
other of sweet sauce. 

Muttoiiy Veiiison fashion, (No. 32.) 

Take a neck of good five or six year old down 
mutton cut long in the bones ; let it hang at least a 
week ; two days before you dress it, take allspice 
and black pepper ground and pounded fine, an 
ounce each, with a quarter of aii ounce of salt- 
petre, and a large spoonful of brown sugar ; rub 
them all well together, and then rub your mutton 
well widi this mixture twice a day : when you 
dress it, wash off the spice with warm water, and 
roast it in paste, as we have ordered the haunch of 
venison : a haunch of mutton will take double the 
quantity of the preparation, and one day longer 
preparing. 

Ohs. — Ingenious epicures have invented 
many methods to make mutton eat like venison : 
the above is the best imitation we have met 



ROASTING. 

with ; and if you get prime mutton, keep it a 
proper time, and prepare and dress it as above 
directed, you may depend upon having a most 
delicious dinner : if it does not possess all the pre- 
cise flavour of venison, it is certainly the most 
savoury and elegant way of eating mutton, which, 
by this process, approximates nearer to the taste of 
venison than by any other way we have tried, 
and is not attended with any extraordinary trouble 
or expense. 

VEAL. (No. SS) 

Veal requires particular care to roast it a fine 
brown. Let the fire be the same as for beef, in 
proportion ; a sound large fire for a large joint, and 
a brisker for a smaller : put it at some distance 
from the fire to soak thoroughly, and then draw it 
near to finish it brown. VVhen it is first laid 
down, it is to be basted with butter ; when it is 
almost done, it is to be basted again, and lightly 
dredged with a little flour to froth it nicely. With 
those joints which are not stuffed, send up cal'es or 
balls of forcemeat, ( No. 375,) as garniJi to the dish, 
or fried pork sausages. Bacon and greens are 
also always expected to attend veal. 

Fillet of Veal, (No. 34.) 

Of from twelve to fourteen pounds, will require 
three hours and a half at a good fire : stuff it with 
forcemeat, (see Receipt, No. 374. J where the bone 
is taken out, and under the flap, that there may 
be some of the stuffing left to eat cold, or to sea-

son a hash : brown it and froth it in the same way 
as beef, and pour good melted butter over it; 
garnish with thin slices of lemon, and cakes or balls 
of stuffing, No. 374, or No. 375. 

A Loin (No. S5.) 

Is the best part of the calf: it will take two 
hours and three quarters roasting. Paper {\\q 
kidney fat and the back. 

A Shoulder, (No. 36.) 

Two hours and a half: stuff it with the force- 
meat ordered for the fillet of veal, but in the 
underside. 

Neck, best end, (No. 37.) 

Will take two hours. The scrag part of a neck of 
veal is not good roasted ; it is best made into a 
pye, or broth. 

Breast, (No. 3^0 

An hour and a half. Let the caul remain on till it 
is almost done, then take it off, to brown it ; baste, 
flour, and froth it. 

Veal Sweetbread. (No. 39.) 

Trim a fine heart-sweetbread, parboil it for four 
or five minutes, and throw it into a basin of cold 
water. 

Beat up the yolk of an egg^ and prepare some 
fine bread crumbs. When the sweetbread is cold, 



ROASTING. 

dry it thoroughly in a cloth, run a lark spit or a 
skewer through it, and tie it on the spit : egg it all 
over with a paste brush, and powder it well with 
bread crumbs, and put it down to roast : twenty or 
thirty minutes will dress them. 

For sauce, fried bread crumbs round them and 
melted butter, with a little mushroom catsup and 
lemon juice. 

Ohs, — Instead of spitting them, you may put 
them into a tin Dutch oven. 

LAMB (No. 40.) 

Is a delicate, tender meat, easily spoiled in the 
dressing ; the fire must be small and brisk, and 
kept clear all the while ; the meat must be papered 
on the outside ; and to the usual accompaniments 
of roast meat, green mint sauce is commonly 
added. 

Grass lamb is in season from Easter to Michael- 
mas. 

House lamb from Christmas to Lady-day. 

Hind Quarter, (No. 41.) 

Of eight pounds, will take from an hour and three 
quarters to two hours, basted and frothed in the 
same way as beef. 

Fore Quarter, (No. 42.) 

Often pounds, two hours.

take off the shoulder from the ribs, to squeeze a

An hour. 

Breast, (No. 48.) 
Three quarters of an hour. 

PORK. (No. 49.) 

The prime season for pork is from Michaelmas 
to March. Take particular care it be done 
enough : other meats underdone are unpleasant 
<o some, but pork is uneatable by all. — liemeru- 
ber your mustard pot. 



ROASTING. 

A Leg, (No. 50.) 

Of eight pounds, will require two hours and a 
half: score the skin across in narrow stripes, 
about half an inch apart ; stuft' the knuckle with a 
little sage and onion minced fine ; rub a liitle sweet 
oil on the skin with a paste brush, or a goose 
feather; this makes the crackling crisp and brown 
much better than basting it with dripping; and it 
will be a better colour than all the art and dili- 
gence of cookery can make it any other way. 
This way of dressing, also, always prevents the 
skin from blistering. 

Leg of Pork roasted xvithout the Skin, or 
Mock Goose. (No. 5\) 

Parboil it for half an hour, take off the skin, 
and then put it down to roast, and baste it with 
butter, and make a savoury powder of dried and 
powdered sage, ground black pepper^ salt, nut- 
meg, and bread crumbs ; sprinkle it with this from 
time to time, as it roasts ; put half a pint of made 
gravy into the dish. 

The Griskin (No. 52.) 

Of seven or eight pounds may be dressed in the 
above manner : it will take an hour and a half 
roasting. 

Bacon, Sparerib, (No. 53.) 

Usually weighs about eight or nine pounds, and 
will take from two to three hours to roast it well ; 



ROASTING. 

not exactly nccordins: to its weiirht, but from tlie 
tliickness of tl]e meat upon it, ^vbicll varies very 
much : lay the thick end nearest lo the fire. A 
proper bald sparerib (so called because almost all 
the meat is pared off,) with a good clear fire, will 
be done in an hour and a half. 

When you lay it down, dust on some flour, and 
baste it >vnh a little butter; dry twelve sai^e leaves, 
and rub them throuirh a hair sieve : about a quar- 
ter oiL an hour before the meat is done, baste it, 
strew on the pulverized sasfe. and dust on a ladle of 
flour, and sprinkle it with a little salt. 

Obs. — Make it a general rule never to pour 
gravy over any thing tliat is roasted ; by so doing, 
the dredging is washed off, and it eats insipid. 
Some people carve a sparerib by cutting out slices 
in the thick part at the bottom of the bones : w hen 
this meat is cut away, the bones may be easily 
separated, and are esteemed very sweet picking. 
Apple sauce, mashed potatoes, and good mustard. 

Zch?, (Xo. 5i.) 

Of iive pounds, must be kept to the fire about an 
Lour and a half. Score the skin, and rub it with 
salad oil, as directed in the receipt for the leg ; 
and you may sprinkle over it some of the savoury 
powder recommended for the mock goose, 

A.Cfiirie (Xo. 55.) 

Is parted down the back-bone, so as to have but 
one side. A good fire will roast it in two hours: 
if not parted, three hours. 



ROASTING. 

Roast Pig, (No. 56.) 

A roasting pig is considered to be in primest 
order for the spit when about three weeks old ; 
should be fixi^ and newly killed. It is not like 
other meats, good as long as thej^ are sweet. The 
pig loses part of its goodness every hour after it is 
killed. To be in perfection, it should be killed in 
the morning to eat at dinner ; and it requires very 
nice and careful roasting ; the ends must have 
much more fire than the middle. For this pur- 
pose is contrived an iron to hang before the middle 
part, called a pig-iron. When the cook has not 
this, she must keep the fire fiercest at the two 
ends. Take the crumb of a stale twopenny loaf, 
i. e. about four ounces, rub it through a cullen- 
der ; mince fine a handful of sage, about two 
ounces and a half, and a large onion, about an 
ounce and a half* ; mix these together with some 
pepper and salt, and a bit of butter as big as an 
egg ; fill the belly of the pig with this, and sew it 
up; lay it to the fire, and take halfa pound of 
fresh butter and keep basting it till it is quite done, 
and do not leave it a moment, for it requires the 
most vigilant attendance. 

Roast it at a clear brisk fire, at some distance, 
that the crackling may get nicely crisped and 
browned without being blistered or burnt : it will 
be enough in about an hour and a half Before 
you take it off the spit, cutoff the head, and part 
that and the body down the middle; chop the 

* Boil the sage and onion in a little water (before they are 
^ut) ; it softens and takes off the rawness of tlieir flavour. 



ROASTING. 

brains very fine with some boiled sage, and mix 
them with some good beef gravy in a sauce-tureen. 
Send up plenty of gravy in the dish, and atureen- 
ful besides. Lay your pig back to back into the 
dish, with one half of the head on one side, the 
other half on the other side, and the ears one at 
each end, which you must take care to make nice 
and crisp, or you will get scolded as well as the 
good man was who bought his wife a pig with only 
one ear. 

Obs. — Some professors of cookery insist upon it 
that nothing so well produces and preserves the 
beauty and crispness of the crackling as sweet oil, 
applied as directed in the receipt to roast a leg 
of pork, 

Turkey, (No. 57) 

A fowl and a turkey require the same manage* 
ment at the fire, only the latter will take more time. 
Let them be carefully picked, &c. and twist up a 
sheet of large clean writing paper, light it, and tho- 
roughly singe the turkey all over, turning it about 
over the flame. Be careful when you draw them 
to preserve the liver, and not to break the gall-bag, 
as no washing will take oflthe bitter taste it gives, 
where it once touches. Prepare a nice clear brisk 
fire, for if the fire be poor and dead, your poultry 
will be vapid and ill-tasted. A very brisk and 
clear fire will only answer the purpose, and this 
will give them their true taste, and make them 
look bf^autiful. 

Prepare your stuffing according to one of the re- 
ceipts in the chapter of forcemeats, &c. No. olQ ; 



ROASTING. 

stuff this under the breast where the craw was 
taken out, paper the breast, place the liver under 
one wing, and the gizzard under the other, baste 
it with butter, and dredge it with flour, keep it at 
a distance from the fire for the first half hour, that 
it may warm gradually, then put it nearer, and 
when it is plumped up, and the steam draws i?i 
toward the fire, it is nearly enough, then take off 
the paper, put a bit of butter into your basting ladle, 
and as it melts baste the turkey with it, and dredge 
it lightly again with flour ; this will raise a much 
finer froth than using the drippings out of the pan. 
A very large turkc}^ of fourteen or fifteen pounds 
weight, will require three hours to roast it tho- 
roughly; a middling sized one of eight or ten 
pounds, about two hours ; and a small one may be 
done in an hour and a half. 

Fried pork sausages are a very savoury and 
relishing accompaniment to either roasted or 
boiled poultry. A turkey thus garnished, is 
called ** an alderman in chains." The sausage 
meat may be used as a stuffing also, instead of the 
ordinary forcemeat. In cold weather a turkey 
eats the better for being kept eight or ten days. If 
you wish it to be tender, never dress it till at least 
four or five days after it has been killed, or a fowl 
till after three. Hen turkeys are preferable to cocks 
for whiteness and tenderness, and the small fleshy 
ones are the most esteemed. 

Send up with them, oyster, egg^ bread, or 
gravy sauce. 

Capons or Foxvls. (No. 58.) 
These must be killed a couple of days before

they are dressed, or they will eat tougb : they are 
managed exactly in the same manner, and sent 
up with the same sauces as a turkey, only require 
proportionately less time at the fire : a full grown 
fowl three quarters, a moderate size one half an 
ho!ir, and a chicken ten minutes less. 

Pork sausages fried are in general a favourite 
accoiupaninsent, or stuff them with turke}' stuffing; 
(see Forcemeats, No. S74, 5, 6, and 7 ;) put in 
plenty of it, so as to plump out the fowl, which 
must be tied closely both at the neck and rump to 
keep in the stuffing: some cooks put the liver of 
the fowl into this lorcemeat, otliers rub it up with 
the flour and butter, to thicken and give flavour 
to the gravy, which receives further improvement 
by stewing the legs of the fowl in it, instead of 
sending them to table, and the fowl looks much 
better without them. 

Obs. — The age in poultry makes all the differ- 
ence : nothing is tenderer than a chicken, and few 
things are tougher or harder of digestion than 
an old cock or hen : the season of perfection in 
pouUry is just before they have quite come to 
their full growth, and before they have begun to 
harden. 



Goose. (No. 59.) 

"When your goose is well picked, singed, and 
cleaned, take two large onions*, and half as much

slices and lay ihem in cold water for a couple oi hours, or add 
as much apple or potatoe as you have onion.

sage, chop them very fine, a hirge breakfas(cup- 
ful of stale bread crumbs, and some pepper and 
salt, add to them tlie yolk of an egg, and incor- 
porate the whole well together ; put this stuffing 
into the goose ; do not quite fill it with stuffing, 
but leave a little room for it to swell, spit it, and 
tie it on the spit at both ends, so as it will not 
swing round, and to keep the stuffing from coming 
out. An hour and a quarter will roast a large full 
grown goose : send up rich gravy and apple 
sauce with it. 

For another stuffing for geese, see No. 388, 
Chapter on Forcemeats^ <^c. 

0^5. —The Michaelmas goose is famous in the 
mouths of the million ; but for those who eat with 
delicacy, it is at that time too full grown. The 
true period when the goose is in its highest perfec- 
tion, is when it has just acquired its full growth, 
and not begun to harden. If the green goose is 
insipid, the Michaelmas goose is rank ; the fine 
time is between both ; from the last week in June 
to the first week inSeptember. 

Green Goose. (No. 60.) 

The only difference in roasting a green, or a 
full grown goose, consists in leaving out the sage 
and onion, and putting only a seasoning of pepper 
and salt into it, and that forty or fifty minutes will 
roast it. 

The following forcemeat is sometimes intro- 
duced : chop some sweet herbs, grate some bread, 
nutmeg, pepper and salt, moisten with an t^^^

and mix with it the liver cut small, and a bit of 
minced bacon ; mix all well together, and fill the 
body of the goose with it. 

Duck. (No. 61.) 

Mind your duck is well cleaned, and tlien wipe 
it out with a clean cloth ; then take an ounce of 
onion, and half an ounce of green sage, chop them 
very fine, and mix them with two ounces, i. e. 
about a teacupful of bread crumbs, a little 
pepper and salt, and the yolk of an egg to bind it ; 
mix these thoroughly together, and put it in the 
duck. For another stuffing, see No. S88. Thirty 
or forty minutes will be enough to roast it, ac- 
cording to the size : contrive to have the feet crisp, 
as some people are very fond of them : to do this, 
you must have a very sharp fire. 

N» B. If you think the raw onion will make 
too strong an impression upon yo\u palate, par- 
boil it. 

(No. 62.) . 

For the following observations I am indebted to 
Major H awker's entertaining and informing work, 
*' Instructions for Younsr Sportsmen^'''' London, 
1816. s /' ' 

" Old pheasants may be distinguished by the 
length and sharpness of their spurs, which in the 
younger ones are short and blunt. 

" Old partridges are always to be known during 
the early part of the season, by their legs being of 
a pale blue, instead of a yellowish brown : so 



ROASTING. 

that when a Londoner receives his brace of blue 
legged birds in September, be should immediately 
snap their legs, and draw out the sinews, by means 
of pulling off the feet, instead of leaving them to 
torment him, like so many strings, when he would 
be wishing to enjoy his repast. This remedy to 
make the legs tender, removes the objection to old 
birds, provided the weather will admit of their 
being sufficiently kept ; and indeed they are then 
often preferable, from having a higher flavour. 

" If birds are over-kept, their legs will be dry, 
their eyes much sunk, and the vent will become 
soft, and somewliat discoloured. The first place 
to ascertain if they are beginning to be high, is the 
inside of their bills, where it is not amiss to put 
some hether straw, or spice, if you want to keep 
them for any length of time. Birds that have 
fallen into the water, or have not had time to get 
cold, should not be packed like others, but sent 
openly, and dressed as soon as possible. Sports- 
men are often heartily abused by their acquaint- 
ance, (I cannot yet bring myself to hackney the 
vrord friends quite so fluently as I ought to do,) 
for sending them ' tough and good-for-nothing 
^ame,' while all the blame should, in many 
instances, rest with themselves, or their pudding- 
headed cook, who may be dresses an old phea- 
sant or hare the very day 4i$/f after it was killed ; 
or perhaps, while engrossed in a story or argument, 
leaves it to roast away, till there remains neither 
juice nor flavour. AH game should be kept till 
properlz/ tender. The following sauce for wild 
fowl has been preferred to about fifty others ; and,

Make a paste of flour and water, as much as \ 
will cover a haunch of venison, wipe it over with ; 
a dry cloth in every part, and take off the skin 
from the upper side, rub a large sheet of paper j 
all over with butter, and cover tbe venison with it, | 
then roll out the paste about three quarters of an 
inch thick, lay this all over the fat side, then co- ,

paper, and tie it very well on with packthread ; i 
have a strong close fire, and baste your venison as \ 
soon as you lay it down to roast, or the paper and i 
string will burn ; it must be well basted all the ; 
lime. A haunch of sixteen pounds will take four !

Lours and a half roasting : a quarter of an hour 
before it is done, the string must be cut, and the 
paste carefully taken off; now baste it with butter, 
dredge it lightly with flour, and when the froth 
rises, and it has got a fine light brown colour, 
garnish the knuckle bone with wet writing paper, 
and send it up, with good gravy in one boat, and 
currant-jelly sauce in the other. 

Obs. Buck venison is in greatest perfection 
from Midsummer to Michaelmas, and Doe from 
November to January. 

Neck and Shoulder of Fenison (No. 64.) 

Are fo be managed in the same way as the 
haunch ; only, as they are smaller joints, they will 
not require so much time. 

The best way to spit a neck, is to put three 
skewers through, and put the spit between the 
skewers and the bones. 

Fawn, (No. 65.) 

When very young, is trussed, stuffed, and 
spittqd the same way as a hare ; but they are 
better eating when of the size of a house lamb, 
they are then roasted in quarters, and the hind 
quarter is most esteemed. They must be put 
down to a very quick fire, and either basted all the 
time they are roasting, or be covered with sheets 
of fat bacon : when done, baste it with butter, and 
dredge it with a little salt and flour till you make 
a nice froth on it. 

Send up venison sauce with it. See the pre- 
ceding receipt, or No. 344, &c, 

i> 1 



ROASTING. 



Hare, (No. 66) 

The first points of consideration are, how old is 
the hare ? and how long it has been killed ? When 
young, it is easy of digestion, and very nourishing ; 
but when old, the contrary in every respect. To 
ascertain the age, examine the first joint of the 
fore foot ; you will find a small knob if it is a 
leveret, "which disappears as it grows older: then 
examine the ears; if they tear easily, it will eat 
tender, if they are tough, so will be the hare, 
which will eat better stewed, or jugged, than it 
-will roasted. When newly killed, the body is 
stiff; as it grows stale, it become limper. As soon 
as you receive a hare, take out the liver, parboil 
it, and keep it for (he stuffing, as some are very 
fond of it ; but do not use it, if it be not quite fresh 
and good. Wipe the hare quite dry, rub the 
inside with pepper, and hang it up in a dry cool 
place. 

Do not prepare too fierce a fire, or you will burn 
the outside before the inside is warm. 

When you have paunched and skinned your 
hare, wash it and lay it in a large pan of cold 
water for four or five hours, changing the water 
two or three times ; lay it in a clean clolh, and 
dry it well, then truss it, and take a twopenny 
loaf and rub the crumb through a cullender, then 
take some dried sweet herbs rubbed fine, a handful 
of parsley, and a roll of very thin cut lemon peel 
minced very fine, some pepper and salt, and a bit 
of butter as big as a walnut: mix all well together 
with the yolk of an egg, and moisten it v/ith milk : 



ROASTING. 

put lliis padding into the belly of your bare, sew 
it up tight, cut the neck skin to let the blood out, or 
it will never appear to be done enough, spit it, and 
put a quart of milk* into your drippingpan, and 
baste it continually till you think it is nearly done, 
(which it will be in about an hour and a quarter ; ) 
if it wants more, let it have it, or it will be hard 
and dry : when almost roasted enough, put a 
quarter of a pound of butter into your basting- 
ladle, and baste it with tliis, and flour it, and 
frotk it nicely. Serve with good gravy, and 
currant-jelly. For another stuffing, sec receipt 
No. 389. Some coolis cut off the head, and 
divide it, and lay one half on each side of the 
hare. 

Obs. — Hares should always be paunched Im 
the field when caught, or as soon as they arc 
brought home, by making an incision in the belly 
about four inches long, then lay hold of the head 
and ears with one hand, and the rump with the 
other, shake it for a little while backwards and 
forwards, and the guts and stomach will fall 
out, leaving the heart, kidneys, and liver beliind ; 
wipe it, &c. as we have directed in Uie beginning 
of this receipt, and put in a wisp of dry straw or 
hay ; it will then keep as long again. 

Cold roast hare will make an excellent soup, 
chopped to pieces, and stewed in three quarts of 
water for a couple of hours : the stuiling will be a

j 

RabbiL (No. 67.) i 

If your fire is clear and sharp, thirty minutes i 

will roast a young one, and forty minutes a full- i 
grown rabbit. 

When you lay it down, baste it with butter, ; 

and dredge it lightly and carefully with flour, that ■ 
you may have it frothy, and of a fine light 

brown. Wliile the rabbit is roasting, boil its liver ■ 

-with some parsley; when tender, chop tliem toge- • 

ther ; melt your butter, and divide the parsley j 
and liver into equal parts, one of which stir into 

the melted butter, and divide the other into half a ■ 

dozen small parcels, and garnish the dish with ' 

them. i 

Obs. — A large, w- ell grown, but young warren- ! 

rabbit, kept some time after it has been killed, | 

roasted with a stuffing in its belly, eats very like j 

a hare, to the nature of which it approaches, in- )

\ 

Pheasant (No. 68.) ; 

Requires a smart fire, but not a fierce one. \ 

Thirty minutes will roast a young bird ; a full ] 

grown pheasant will require forty. Pick and j 

draw it, and cut a slit in tlie back of the neck, i 

and take out the craw, but don't cut the head off; i

but cut the toes off"; turn the head under the 
wing, and skewer the wings close to the back: 
baste it, butter and froth it, &c., as we have 
given you instructions to do in the receipt to 
roast fowls and turkeys. 

Mock Pheasant. (No. 69.) 

If you have only one pheasant and wish for a 
companion for it, get a fine young fov/1 of as near 
as may be the same size. as the bird to be matched, 
truss with the head on, turned exactly like the 
pheasant's, and dress it according to the above 
directions, and very few persons will discover 
which is the pheasant, and which is the fowl, 
especially if the latter has been kept four or five 
days. 

P a j^t ridges (No. 70.) 

Are cleaned and trussed in the same manner as 
a pheasant, and the breast is so plump it will re- 
quire almost as much time roasting : send up with 
them bread sauce. No. 321, and good gravy. 

*** {f you zckh to preserve them longer than you think they 
will keep good undressed, half roust them, and they zoill 
keep two or three days longer. 

Black Cock, (No. 71 .) Moor Game, (No. 72.) 
and Grouse, (No. 73.) 

Are dressed like pheasants and partridges : the 
black cock will take as much time as a pheasant, 
and the moor game and grouse as the partridge : 
d3 



ROASTING. 

send up with them currant-jelJy and fried bread 
crumbs. 

Wild Ducks. (No. 74.) 

For roasting a wild duck, you must have a clear 
brisk fire ; for it must be browned upon the outside, 
without being sodden within. To have it well froth- 
ed and full of gravy is the nicety. Prepare the fire 
by stirring and raking just before it is laid down, 
and fifteen or twenty minutes will do it. This is 
the fashionable way ; but if it is required a little 
more done, allow it a few minutes more : if it is 
too much, it will lose all i(s fine high flavour. 

For the sauce, see ^o, S38. 

JVidgeons and Teal (No. 75.) 

Are dressed exactly as the wild duck, only that 
less time is requisite for a widgeon, and still Icsi 
for a teal. 

Woodcock. (No. 76.) 

Spit them on a small bird spit, put them to roast 
at a clear fire, and lay a slice of bread in the 
drippingpan under them to catch the trail*; 
haste them with butter, and froth them with flour; 
lay the toast on a hot dish, and the birds on it ; 
pour some gocil beef gravy into the dish, and 
send some up in a boat : about twenty, or 

* This bird, it seems, has so insinuated itself into the favour 
of refined gourmands, th:it they pay it the same honours as the 
grand Lama, making a ragout of its excrements, and devoui'- 
mg tliem with ecstasy. 



KOASTING. 

twenty-five minutes will roast (hem. Garnish 
with slices of lemon. 

Sjiipes (No. 77-) 

Differ little from woodcocks, unless in size : they 
are to be dressed in the same way; only they are, 
according to their smaller size, done in from five 
to ten minutes less time. 

Roast Pigeons, (No. 78.) 

AVhen the pigeons arc trussed for roasting"^ 
chop a handful of green parsley very fine, season 
it with a little pepper and salt, and fill the belly 
of each bird with this mixture. Roast them at a 
hot clear fire, they will be enougli in about fifteen 
or twenty minutes : send up parsley and butter in 
the dish under them, and some in a boat. 

Obs, — If the pigeons are fresh, they will this 
way have their full relish, for there is no bird has 
a finer flavour, but it goes entirely off with a very 
Ihtle keeping ; nor is it ever so well preserved as 
by roasting : a little melted butter may be put 
into tlie dish with them, and the gravy that runs 
from them will mix with it info fine sauce. Pi- 
geons are in tJieir greatest perfection in September, 
as there then is the most plentiful and best food 
for them : and the finest growth for them is just 
when they are full feathered. Wlien they are in 
the pen-feathers they are flabby ; when they are 
full grown and have flown some time, the}^ are 
hard ; just at the period of their growth, when 
they are at perfection, and have had no time to 
d4 



ROASTING. 

Jiarden, tliey are best ; their juices are then in full 
perfection, and the flesh in all its delicacy. 

This wns the secret of Solomon^ the famous 
pigeon-feeder of Turnham Green, who is cele- 
brated by the poet Gay, 

" That Turnham Green which dainty pigeons fed, 
But feeds no more, for Solomon is deud." 

Pigeons on a poor iiuafs spit. (No. 79.) 

Fill Uieir bellies with parsley clean washed and 
chopped, the livers minced tisic, grated bread and 
hard eg:g, an equal quantity of each, season it with 
a very little beaten mace or nutmeg-, and pounded 
all together with the yolk of an e<^^ ; tie the neck 
end close, so that it cannot come out ; put a skewer 
through the legs, and have a little iron on pur- 
pose with six hooks to it ; on each hook hang a 
pigeon, fasten one end of a string to the chim- 
ney piece, and the other end to the iron (which is 
commonly called a poor man's spit,) flour them, 
and baste them with butter, turn them steadily 
and gently, and they will roast very nicely, and 
be full of gravy : garnish with crisp parsley. 

Ohs. — This is by far the best way of roasting 
pigeons, as it preserves their gravy ; when you 
roast them on a spit, much of the gravy runs out ; 
if you stufl'them and broil them whole, you can- 
not save the gravy so well, though they are very 
good with parsley and butter in the dish, or split 
and broiled with pepper and salt. 

Larks, and other small Birds, (No. 80.) 

These delicate little birds are in high season in 
November. When they are picked, gutted, and 



ROASTING. 

cleaned, truss them with a leaf of red sage to every 
lark between tlie joints of the legs; beat up the 
yolk of an ei^g-, and with a feather egg the larks, 
and then sprinkle them well with bread crumbs ; 
cut some thin slices of fat bacon about three 
inches long and an inch broad ; lay tJie birds in 
a row, side by side, with a piece of bacon between 
every two larks ; spit them on a lark spit, which 
lie on to a larger spit, having a slice of bacon on 
both the outisides of the larks ; baste them well 
while they are roasting : for the sauce, fry some 
grated bread crisped in butter, and set it to drain 
before the fire that it may harden : serve the 
crumbs under the larks when you dish them, and 
garnish them with slices of lemon. 

Wheat Ears. (No. 81.) 

These birds are dressed in the same way as 
larks. 

Lobster, (No. 82.) 

See receipt for boiling. No. 176. 
We give no receipt for roasting lobster, being 
of opinion with Dr. King, that 

" By roasting that which our forefathers boiled, 
And boiling what they roasted, much is spoiled."

FRYING. 

the pan as soon as the fat is melted ; as less fat i^ 
wanted, it gets hot so much sooner, they would be 
burnt before they are done enough. 

Always have a good light to fry by, that you 
may see when you have got the right colour : a 
lainp fixed on a stem with a loaded foot, that has 
an arm which will lengthen out, and slide up and 
down like a reading candlestick, is a most useful 
appendage to a kitchen fire-place^ which are sel- 
dom light enough for the nicer operations of 
cookery. After all, if you do not drain the fat 
well from what you have fried, your cooking will 
do you no credit, especially those things that are 
full dressed in bread crumbs. 

To fry fish in general, see the receipt io fry 
soles, which is the only circumstantial account of 
this process that has yet been printed, if the cook 
will study it with a little attention, she will soon 
learn to fry fish in the utmost perfection. 



FRYING. 



To clarify Drippings, (No. 83.) 

Put your drippings into a clean saucepan over 
a clear fire ; when it is just going to boil, take it 
ofi', and pour them into a pan half full of hot 
water; set it in a cool place till the next day, 
you will find the drippings at the top of the 
water as clean and white as can be. 

Most people put the drippings into cold water, 
but that sets them at once, and the foul parts will 
not be deposited half so well. 

Ohs. — Sweet and well cleansed drippings, and 
the fat skimmings of the broth pot, will baste every 
thing as well as butter, except game and poultry, 
and should supply the place of butter for common 
fries, and for frying most things are equal, if not 
superior to lard. 

To melt Suet to fry with, (No. 84.) 

Cut beef or mutton suet into small thin slices, 
put it into a thick and well tinned saucepan, and 
set it over a very slow stove, or in an oven, till it 
is all melted but the skins ; strain it into a clean 
brown pan through a hair sieve. When quite cold, 
tie a paper over it and keep it for use. Hogslard 
is prepared in the same way. 

Ohs. — The waste occasioned by the present 



FRYING. 

fashion of feeding cattle till tlicy are almost as 
mnch fU as lean, may, by <^ood management, be 
in some measure prevented, by cutting- off the su- 
perfluous suet, and preparing it as above, or make 
puddings of it. 

Rump Steaks fried. (No. 85.) 

Let the steaks be cut rather thinner than for 
broiling, put some butter into an iron fryingp<^n, 
when it is hot lay in the steaks, and keep turning 
them till they are done enough ; lay them in a hot 
dish before the fire ; then put a tablespoonful of 
flour into the fryingpan with half a pint of hot 
■water, a tablespoonful of ale, or small beer, that 
is neither bitter nor stale, a tablespoonful of 
mushroom catsup, a teaspoonful of salt, and 
half a teaspoonful of ground black pepper ; rub 
and boil up together for a couple of minutes, and 
run the sauce through a hair sieve over the steaks. 

Ohs. — We like this way of dressing a beef 
steak much better than broiling, as all the gravy 
is preserved, and the meat eats more tender and is 
more equally dressed. 

Beef Steaks and Onions. (No. 86.) 

Fry (he steaks according to the direciions given 
in the preceding receipt; lay them on a dish io 
keep hot : have ready some onions jsliccd as thin as 
possible, {vy them brown in the same pan the steaks 
Avere fried in; when done, lake them up with a 
fish slice, and lay them on the steaks, then finish 
the sauce as in the foregoing receipt, or prepare 
the onion sauce as No. 299. 



FRYING. 

Sausages. (No. 87.) 

To prevent their bursting in the fryirigpan, 
lay them in a deep dish, pour boiling- wafer over 
them, and let them be till they are cold ; then 
prick them with a fork, put tliem into a fry- 
ingpan, and shake them about till they are well 
browned. 

No butter or lard, &c. is required ; putting them 
in the boiling water prevents the skins^ from 
cracking. 

Obs. — Poached eggs, pease-pudding, or fried 
cabbage sent up with them, are excellent ac- 
companiments. 

Sweetbreads full dressed. (No. 88.) 

Parboil them, let them g<^i cold, and then cut 
them in pieces three quarters of an inch thick, 
dip them in the yolk of an ^%%^ then in tine bread 
crumbs, with a little pepper, salt, and very little 
nutmeg ; put some fresh butter into a fryingpan ; 
when it boils, put in the sweetbreads, and fry them 
a fine brown. For sauce, mushroom catsup and 
melted butter. 

Sweetbreads plain. (No. 89.) 

Parboil them, slice them as before, and fry 
them a delicate brown, take care to drain the 
fat well from them, and garnish them with 
slices of lemon, and sprigs of parsley or chervil. 
Or when parboiled, &c., dip them in the fol- 
lowing batter : an ounce of flour, an ^gg, a table- 



FRYING. 

spoonful of milk, and the same of table beer, a 
little white pepper and salt beaten tog^ether with 
a wooden spoon for ten minutes : fry them a nice 
brown, put a little catsup and butter in the dish, 
and garnish it with fried parsley. 

%* Take care to have a fresh szveeibread ; for it spoils 
almost sooner than any thing, and should he parboiled as 
soon as it comes in. This is called blanching, or setting it. 
Mutton kidneys may be broiled and sent up with the szceet- 
breads. 

Veal Cutlets, (No. 90.) 

Let your cutlets be about half an inch thick, 
trim them, and flatten them with a cleaver ; you 
may fry them in fresh butter, or good beef drip- 
ping ; or first fry some bacon, and the fat of that 
mehing will leave enough in the pan to fry your 
veal : when brown on one side, turn them and do 
the other; or if the fire is very fierce, they must 
change sides oftener. The time they will take 
depends on the thickness of the cutlet and the 
heat of the fire : half an incli tliick will take about 
fifteen minutes. Put the trimmings into a «tew- 
pan with a pint of water, an onion, a roll of lemon 
peel, a blade of mace, a sprig of thyme and pars- 
ley ; let it stew over a slow fire an hour, then 
strain it, and put half an ounce of butter into a 
stewpan ; as soon as it is melted, mix with it a 
tablespoon ful of flour, stew it over the fire a few 
minutes, then add the gravy by degrees till it is 
all mixed, boil it up for five minutes, and strain it 
through a tarn mis sieve, and put it to the cutlets : 
you may add some browning, catsup, or lemon 
pickle, &c. to it. 



FRYING. 

Veal Cutlets full dressed, (No. 91.) 

Cut your veal into pieces a little bigger than a 
crown piece, chop fine, or, what is better, take a 
little of the dried powder of parsley, lemon i\\ym& 
(savoury or marjoram), lemon peel a little grated, 
nutmeg and mace, pepper and salt ; rub these 
well together in a mortar, beat up the yolk and 
white of an Qg^ together on a plate, dip the cutlets 
in it, and then strew the seasoning over them, 
dip them again in the egg^ and then strew some 
fine bread crumbs over them, put a little butter 
into a cold fryingpan over a slow fire, and fry 
them a nice brown. Make gravy as in the last 
receipt. 

Lamb, or Mutton Chops, (No. 92.) 
Are dressed in the same way. 

Pork Chops, (No. 93.) 

Cut as many chops from the loin as you want, 
about half an inch thick ; trim them neatly ; put a 
fryingpan on the fire ; as soon as it is hot, put ia 
your chops, turning them often till brown all over, 
they will be enough in fifteen minutes : take one 
upon a plate and try it ; if done, season with 
pepper and salt. For gravt/, keep half a table- 
spoonful of the fat in the pan you fried the chops 
in, put to it about a teaspoonful of flour, rub it 
well together over the fire, as soon as it looks a 
little brown put a teacupful of water, season 



FRYING 



Vritb sal(, give it a boil up, strain through a hair 
sieve to your chops, or you may send them up with 
their own gravy in the dish. 

Obs. — A little powdered sage, &c., strewed 
over them, will give them a nice relish. See 
No. 31. 



BROILING. 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS- 



Cleanliness is extremely essential in this mode 
of cookery. Keep your gridiron quite clean be- 
tween the bars, and bright on the top ; and when 
it is hot, wipe it well with a linen cloth : just 
before you use it, rub the bars with clean mutton 
suet, which will prevent the meat from being 
marked by the gridiron; take care to prepare your 
fire in time, so that it may burn \ery clear; the 
briskness and clearness of the fire are indispensable. 
Very frequent turning is necessary to some things, 
and very little to others ; be very attentive to 
watch the moment any thing is done ; never hasten 
in any manner any thing that is broiling, lest yon 
make smoke and spoil it. Let the bars of the 
gridiron be all hot through, but yei not burning 
hot upon the surface : this is the perfect and fine 
condition of the gridiron ; for if it is hastily 
heated, the bars wiQ be hot enough to scorch the 
things laid on them on the outside, as ihc bars 



BRO FLING. 

must always keep away so much of the heat as 
their breadth covers : it is absolutely necessary 
they should be thoroughly hot before the thing 
to be cooked be laid on them. The bars of 
gridirons should be made concave, terminating in 
a trough to catch the gravy ; and also keep the 
fat from dropping into the tire and making a 
smoke, which will spoil your broil. The upright 
gridirons are the best, as they can be used at any 
fire without fear of smoke, and all the gravy is 
preserved. 



BROILING. 



Beefsteaks^. (No. 94.) 

Those who are nice about steaks never attempt 
to have them except in weather that permits the 
meat to be hung till it is tender. The best steaks 
are those cut from the middle of the rump, that 
has been killed at least four days, when they can 
be cut about six inches long, four inches wide, 
and half an inch thick, let them be beaten with a 
chopper, or rolling-pin, to make them tender; 
take care to have a very clear brisk fire, and 
throw a little salt on it, to take off tlie sulphur, 
make the gridiron hot, and set it slanting, to pre- 
vent the fat from dropping into the lire, and 
making a smoke. For want of these little atten- 
tions, this very common dish, which every body 
is supposed capable of dressing, seldom comes to 
table in perfection. 

Put a tablcspoonful of catsup and a little 
minced shalot into a dish before the fire, while 
you broil the steak; turn it ofteji, to keep the 
gravy in : it will be done in ten minutes ; rub a 
bit of butter over it, and send it up garnished with 
horseradish. No, 356. 



* The season for these is from the 29th of Sept. to the 
$5th of March. 



BROILING. 

Kidneys. (No. 9o) 

Cut the kidneys through the long ^vay. score, 
them, and broil them over a very clear tire, turn- 
ing tliem often till they are done, which will take 
about ten minutes, if the fire is brisk. Lay tlieni 
on the dish, sprinkle them with a little salt and 
pepper, and rub a piece of butter over them, or 
fry Ihem in butter, and make gravy for tliem in 
the pan, (after you have taken out the kidneys,) 
by putting in a teaspoonful of flour ; as soon as it 
looks brown, put in as much water as will make 
gravy for your kidneys : they take five minutes 
more to fry than to broil. 

The Inside of a Sirloin of Beef, (No. 96) 

Cut out the inside of a sirloin of beef close to 
the bone, in steaks nearly a quarter of an inch 
thick ; take off all the skins, and season it w ith pep- 
per and salt, then warm an ounce of butter on a 
plate, just enough to melt it a little, but not to 
make it into a thin oil, mix the yolk of an egg 
witli it, dip the steaks in on botli sides, and then 
in fine bread crumbs; lay them on a clean gridiron, 
over a clear slow fire; if the fire is sharp, the bread 
crumbs will be burnt before the beef is done : 
when you turn them, take them off the fire, and 
lay them on a dish to catch the gravy : when they 
are dressed, put them on a hot dish with their own 
gravy, and a spoonful of mushroom catsup. 

A Fowl or Chicken. (No. 97.) 

Pick and truss a fowl the same as for boiling, cut 
it open down the back, wipe the inside clean with a 



BROlLiXC. 

cloth, season it with a little white pepper and salt, 
and lay it on a gridiron over a very clear slow fire, 
with the inside of the fowl towards the fire ; turn 
it in about ten minutes, and it will take about 
ten minutes more to broil it till it is a fine brown. 
Lay it on a hot dish, with mushroom sauce 
thrown over it, or melted butter flavoured with 
mushroom catsup or cavice : garnish with the 
liver and the gizzard, slit and notched, and sea- 
soned with pepper and salt, and broiled nicely 
brown, and some slices of lemon. For sauce, see 
No. 355. 

Pigeo7is. (No. 98.) 

Clean them well, split them down the backs, 
and pepper and salt them ; broil them over a 
clear slow fire ; turn them often, and put a litde 
butter on them : when they are done, pour over 
them, either stewed or pickled mushrooms, and 
melted butter. 

Garnish with fried sippets ; or, when the 
pigeons are trussed as for boiling, flat them with a 
cleaver, taking care not to break the skin, or the 
backs, or breasts ; season them with pepper and 
salt, dip them in melted butter, and dredge them 
well with grated bread, then lay them on the 
gridiron, and turn them frequently : if your fire is 
not very clear, lay them on a sheet of paper well 
buttered, to keep them from getting smoked. 

Same sauce as in the preceding receipt.

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 



There is no article in -which the diiference 
between an elegant and an ordinary table is more 
seen, than in the dressing of greens : they may be 
the same at one place as at another ; however, 
their look and taste are extremely different, and 
this chiefly from the careless way in which they 
are cooked.- As to the quality of vegetables, 
freshness is their only value and excellence ; 
the eye easily discovers if they have been 
kept too long ; they soon lose their beauty 
in all respects. Roots, greens, &c. and the 
various productions of the garden, when first 
gathered, are plump and firm, and have a fra- 
grant freshness, that no art can give them again, 
-when they have lost it by being kept too long, 
though it will revive them a little to put them 
into cold spring water for some time. They are 
in greatest perfection just before they come to 
their full growth. Soft water will preserve the 



VE<JETABLES. 

gieen colour best ; if you have only liaid water, 
put to it a teaspoonful of salt of wormwood. 

Take care to wash and cleanse them from dust, 
dirt, and insects: this requires ^rcat attention: 
pick off all the outside leaves, and trim them 
nicely, and lay them in a pan of clean water far 
an hour before you dress them. They should 
always be boiled in a saucepan by themselves^ 
and have plenty of water : if meat is boiled with 
them in the same pot, they spoil the look and 
taste of each other. 

The water must always boil before you put in 
what you intend to boil in it, which should boil 
briskl}^, in an open saucepan ; the quicker they 
boil, the greener they will be ; and when the 
vegetables sink, they are generally done enough, 
if the water has been kept constantly boiling ; 
but if it has not, they will lose their colour. 
Take them up immediately, or they will lose their 
colour and goodness. Drain the water from them 
thoroughly before you send them to table. This 
humble branch of cookery requires very constant 
attention : if vegetables are too long on the fire, 
they lose all their beauty and flavour, and if they 
are not thoroughly boiled tender, they are tre- 
mendously indigestible, and much more trouble- 
some to the stomach than underdone meats* 

£ 



VEGETABLES. 

Above all, take care your vegetables are fresh ; for 
as the fishmonger often suffers for the sins of the 
cook, so the cook often gets undeservedly blamed 
for not well dressing vegetables, which, in this 
metropolis, are often kept so long, that no art can 
make them either look or eat well. 



VEGETABLES. 



Potatoes. (No. 102.) 

Although this most useful vegetable is dressed 
every day, in almost every family, it is very sel- 
dom well prepared ; and for one plate of potatoes 
that comes to table as it should, ten are spoiled. 

Be careful in your choice of potatoes ; no vege- 
table varies so much in quality. The reddish 
kind are better than the white, but the yellowish 
looking ones are generally the best. Choose them 
of a moderate size, free from all blemishes, and 
fresh, and buy them in the mould ; they should 
not be wetted till they are cleaned to boil. Peel and 
wash them, fill the saucepan half full of potatoes 
of equal size*, and put to them as much cold water 
as will cover them about an inch : most boiled things 
are spoiled by having too little water, but potatoes 
are commonly spoiled by too much : they must 
merely be covered, and a little allowed for waste 
in boiling, so that they may be covered at last. 

Set them on a moderate fire till they boil, then 
take them off, and set them by the side of the fire 
to boil gently (the slower the better) till they are 
soft enough to admit a fork, (there is no depend- 
ence on the usual test of their cracking or break- 
ing, which, if they are boiled fast, some potatoes 
will do when they are not half done, and tJie in- 
side is quite hard,) then pour the water from 
them, uncover the saucepan, and set it by the side 

* Or the small ones will be done to pieces before the lai^e 
ones are boiled enough.

of the fire for fifteen or twenty minutes, that their 
superfluous moisture may evaporate, and they will 
become perfectly dry and mealy. 

This method of managincr potatoes is in every 
respect superior to steaming them; they are dress- 
ed in half the time, and will retain no moisture. 

Obs. — There are so many different sorts and 
sizes of potatoes, it is impossible to say how long 
they will take doing; the best way is to try them 
"with a fork. Moderate sized potatoes will gene- 
rally be enough in fifteen or twenty minutes. 

Potatoes boiled and broiled, (No. 103.) 

Dress your potatoes exactly as before directed, 
put them on a gridiron over a very clear, brisk 
fire; turn them as they brown, till they are done 
all over, and send them up dry, with melted but- 
ter in a cup. 

Potatoes fried in slices, (No. 104.) 

Peel large potatoes, and slice them the thick- 
ness of a two- penny piece ; dry them well in a 
clean cloth, flour them, and fry them in lard. 
Take care that your lard and fryingpan are quite 
clean; put it on a quick fire, watch it, and as 
soon as it boils, and the lard is still, put in the 
slices of potatoe, and keep moving them till they 
are crisp ; take them up and lay them to drain on 
a sieve, send them up with a very little salt sprink- 
led over th€m. 

Potatoes fried whole, (No. 105.) 

When boiled as per the first receipt, put them 



VEGETABLES. 

into a stewpan with some nice clean beef drip- 
pings, shake them about often for fear of burning 
till they arc of a fine brown, and crisp : drain theni 
well from the fat, and send them up. 

Ohs. — It will be an elegant improvement to 
tlie three last receipts, previous to frying or 
broiling the potatoes, to dip them in the yolk of 
an Qggj and then in fine sifted bread crumbs. 

To mash Potatoes, (No. 106.) 

When your potatoes are boiled, drain and dry 
them perfectly, and rub them through a cullen- 
der, or, what is still better, a coar&e hair sieve, into a 
clean stewpan : to a pound of potatoes put about 
half an ounce of butter, and a large tablespoonful 
of milk; mix them well together, and put them 
by the side of the fire to keep warm ; if you put 
them too near they will get a bad taste. 

Ohs.- — After Lady-day, when the potatoes are 
getting old and specky, this is the best way of 
dressing them. 

Mash Potatoes with Onions, (No. 107.) 

Prepare some boiled onions by putting them 
through a sieve, and mixing them with the pota- 
toes. In proportioning the onions to the potatoes, 
you will be guided by your wish to have more or 
less of ^heir flavour. 

Escalloped Potatoes. (No. 108.) 

Mash the potatoes as before directed ; then- 
have some nice scollop shells, very clean, and 
e3 



VEGETABLES. 

well biiUered ; put in your potatoes, make them 
smooth at the top, score them across with a knife, 
strew a few fine bread crumbs on them, and 
sprinkle them with a paste brush with a few drops'; 
of mehed butter, and set them in a Dutch oven; 
when they are browned on the top, take them care- 
fnlly out of tlie shells and brown the other side, 
if you have no scollop shells, put thcni into tea- 
cups. 

Roast Potatoes. (No. 109.) 

Wash and dry your potatoes, put them in a tin 
Dutch oven, or cheese toaster ; take care not to 
put them too near at first, or they will get burnt on 
the outside before they are warmed through. Large 
potatoes will require two hours to roast them. 

Roast Potatoes imder Meat. (No, 1 10.) 

Peel and wash large potatoes, put them on the 
fire in cold water, and let them boil till they are 
half done ; drain the water from them, and put 
them into an earthen dish, or small tin pan: set 
them under the meat that is roasting, and baste 
them with some of the drippings ; when they are 
browned on one side, turn (hern and brown them 
all over ; send them up round the meat, or in a 
small dish. 

Potatoe Balls. (No. 111.) 

Mix mashed potatoes with the yolk of an egg, 
roll them into balls, flour them, and fry them in 
clean drippings. Brown them in a Dutch oven. 



VEGETABLES. 

Savoury Potatoe Balls (No. 1 12.) 

Are made by adding a quarter of a pound of 
(grated ham to a pound of mashed potatoes with 
the yolk of a couple of eggs, as in the last receipt. 

Obs. — They are an agreeable relish to veal, 
and make a good supper dish. 

Casserole of Potatoes, (No. 113.) 

Peel, wash, and boil your potatoes till they are 
soft enough to mash ; drain and dry them well, 
then mash them till they arc very fine; season with 
a little salt, some butter and milk ; make a wall 
of about three inches high and an inch and a 
half thick all round the dish; set it in a Dutch 
oven till it is of a fine light brown colour. 

Fill the middle with stewed rump steaks, broiled 
mutton, or lamb chops, or harrico mutton, or pork 
chops. 

Potatoe Snozv. (No. 1 14.) 

Clioose those that are free from spots, and the 
whitest you can pick out ; put them on to boil in 
cold water, and wlien they begin to crack, strain 
the water from them, and put them into a clean 
stewpau by the side of the fire till they arc quite 
dry and fall to pieces ; rub them through a sieve 
on the dish they are to be sent up in, and do not 
disturb them afterwards. 

To dress Watery Potatoes, (No. 115.) 

Wash the potatoes clean, and put them into a- 
E 4 



VEGETABLES. 

closely covered pot, without any water, on a slow 
fire; the heat very soon draws out sufficient 
water to stew them in, and the potatoes so 
manaocd are dry and mealy, though the same 
boiled in the common way are hardly eatable. 

A'^ew Potatoes, (No. 1 16.) 

The best way to clean new potatoes when they 
are too young to peel, is to rub tliem with a coarse 
cloth or a flannel, or scrubbing brush ; and pro- 
ceed as in the first receipt to boil potatoes. 

Jerusalem Artichokes (No. 117.) 

Are boiled in the same manner as potatoes, and 
dressed in the various ways we have just before 
directed for potatoes. 

Cabbage. (No. 118.) 

Pick them very carefully clean, and wash them 
thoroughly, and after washing, look them over 
carefully again ; quarter them if you please, if 
they are very large. Put them into a saucepan 
with plenty of boiling water ; if any scum rises, 
take it off, put a large spoonful of salt into the 
saucepan, and boil them till the stalks feel tender. 
A young cabbage will take about twenty minutes, 
when full grown, half an hour : see that they are 
well covered with water all the time, and that no 
smoke or dirt arises from stirring the fire. By this 
management, they will look as beautiful when 
dressed, as they did when growing. 



VEGETABLE? 

Boiled Cabbage fried, (No. 1190 
See receipt for Bubble and Squeak, 

Savoys (No. 120.) 

Are boiled in the same manner, but always 
quarter them when you send them to table. 

Sprouts and young Greens. (No. 121.) 

The receipt we hav^e written for cabbages will 
answer as well for sprouts, only ihcy will be boiled 
enough in fifteen or twenty minutes. 



Spinach. (No. 122.) ■ 

Spinach should be picked a leaf at a time, and ; 

washed in three or four waters : when perfectly , 

clean, lay it on a sieve, or cullender, to drain the ' 

water from it. Put a large saucepan on the fire ; 

three parts tilled with water ; when it boils, put a I 

small handful of salt to it, with the spinach, let it \ 

boil as quick as possible till quite tender ; it will i 

be enough in about ien ininutes, if boiled in plenty : 
of water; if the spinach is a liltle old, give it a 

couple of m-inutes longer. Wlien done strain it ^ 

on the back of a sieve, squeeze it dry with a plate, '■ 
or between two trenchers, chop it fine, and put it 

into a stewpan with a bit of butter and a little ; 

salt ; a little cream is a great improvement Spread ^ 

it in a dish, and cut it into squares of proper size ■ 
to help at table. 

Ohs. — A little grated nutmeg is a favourite ad- i

tlition with some cooks, and is added \\licn you 
stir it up in the stewpan with the butter. 

Asparagus. (No. 123.) 

Set a pan of cold water upon the table, and a 
stewpan with plenty of water in it on the fire; 
sprinkle a handful of salt into it, and while it is 
heating prepare your asparagus. Scrape all the 
stalks till they are perfectly clean, throw them 
into the pan of cold water as you scrape them ; 
when they are all done, tie them up in little bun- 
dles, with bass if you can get i(, or tape; string 
cuts tliem to pieces : cut off the stalks at the bot- 
tom that they may be all of a length, leaving just 
enough to serve as a handle for the green part; 
put them on when the water boils ; when they arc 
tender at the stalk, which will be in about ten 
minutes, they are done enough. Great care must 
be taken to watch the exact time of their becom- 
ing tender, and take them up just at that instant, 
and they will have their true flavour and colour, 
but a minute or two more boiling destroys both. 

While the asparagus are boiling, toast a round 
of a quartern loaf about half an inch thick, brown 
it delicately on both sides, dip it lightly in the 
liquor of the asparagus, and lay it in the middle 
of a dish ; melt some butter, then lay in the aspa- 
ragus upon the toast all round the dish, with the 
ends of the stalks outwards. Pour no butter over 
them, but send it up in a boat. To the common 
melted butterV^on may add a little pepper and 
salt, a (easpoonfiil of vinegar, and the yolk of a 
couple of eggs, beat up, and carefully mixed to 
keep them from curdling. 



VEGETABLES. 

Sea Kail (No. 124.) 

Is tied up in bundles, and dressed exactly ia 
the same way as asparagus. 

Cauliflower. (No. 125.) 

Cboose those that are close and white, trim off 
the outside leaves, cut the stalk off flat at the bot- 
tom, let them lie in salt and water an hour before 
you boil them, put them into boiling water with a 
handful of salt in it, and let it boil slowly till done, 
which a small one will be in fifteen, a very large 
one in twenty minutes, and take them up care- 
fully with a slice. 

Brocoll (No. 12G.) 

The great art in dressing brocoli is, that it be 
not overboiled, and yet boiled enough. Set a pan 
of clean cold water on the table, and a saucepan 
on the fire with plenty of water, and a handful of 
salt in it : the brocoli is prepared by stripping 
off all the side shoots, leaving the top: peel oil' 
the skin of the stalk with a knife, cut it off at the 
bottom, and put them into the pan of cold water : 
when the water in the stew pan boils, and all the 
brocoli is ready, put it in, let it boil briskly till the 
stalks feel tender, and take it up with a slice, that 
you may not break it ; let it drain, and serve up: 
if some of the heads of brocoli are much bigger 
than the others, put them on to Jiipil first, so that 
they may get all done together. *^8^'" 

Ohs. — It makes a nice supper dish served 
upon a toast, like asparagus. 



VEGETABLES. 

Red Beet Roots (No. 127.) 

Are not so much used as they deserve ; they are 
boiled exactly in the same way as parsnips : a 
large root will take an hour and a half boiling ; to 
be sent to table with salt fish, boiled beef, &c. 

Parsnips (No. 128.) 

Are to be done just in the same manner as carrots, 
only give them as much water as you can ; they 
require more or less time according to their size, 
and you must try them by tlirusting a fork into 
(hem as they are in the water ; when that goes 
easily through, they are done enough : an hour 
and a quarter will boil a large parsnip. 

Obs. — Parsnips are sometimes sent up mashed 
in the same way as turnips. 

Carrots. (No. 129.) 

Let them be well washed and brushed, not 
scraped ; half an hour is enough for young spring 
carrots; grown carrots will take an hour and a 
half; and the large Sandwich kind full two hours. 
When done, rub off the peels with a clean coarse 
cloth, and slice them in two or four, according to 
their size. The best way to try if they are done 
enough, is to pierce them with a fork. 



^^rnips. (No. 130) 

Peel off half an inch of the stringy outside ; full- 
grown turnips will take thirty minutes gentle boil- 
ing ; (if they boil too fast, they will burst ;) try 



VEGETABLES. 

them with a fork ; when tender, take them up, and 
lay them on a sieve ten minutes, to drain the 
water thoroughly from them. 

Obs. — Young turnips should not be peeled. 

To Mash Turnips. (No. 131.) 

When they are boiled quite tender, squeeze 
them as dry as possible between two trenchers, 
put them into a saucepan, and mash them with a 
wooden spoon, add a little bit of butter, keep 
stirring them till the butter is melted and well 
mixed with them, and they are ready for table. 

Turnip tops (No. 132.) 

Are the shoots which grow out, in the spring, of 
the old turnip roots. Put them into cold water 
an hour before they are dressed ; the more water 
they are boiled in, the better they will look ; if 
boiled in a small quantity of water, they will taste 
bitter ; when the water boils, put in a small hand- 
ful of salt, and then your vegetables ; if fresh and 
young, they will be done in about twenty 
minutes : drain them on the back of a sieve. 

French Beans. (No. \^o) 

Cut off the stalk end, and beginning at the 
other, string them carefully ; the strings are very 
tender when they first come in, but are as hard, in 
proportion io the beans then, as they are wiien 
more grown : cut off the stalks and tips; let a bowl 
of spring water, with a little salt dissolved in it, 



VEGETABLES. 

stand hcfcre yoii, and as the beans are cleaned 
and stringed, throw them in : when all are done, 
put t!icm on the fire, in boiling water, with some 
salt in it ; when fhey have boiled fifteen or twenty 
minutes, take one out and taste it; as soon as 
tliey are tender*, throw them into a cullender, 
drain (hem, and lay them on a plate, in a little 
heap, highest in the middle. To send up the beans 
whole is much the best method, when they 
are thus young, and their delicate flavour 
and colour are much better preserved. When 
a little more grown, they must be cut across 
in two, after strin^ ing ; and foY common tables, 
they are to be split first, and cut across after- 
wards; but those who are nice, never have 
them at such a growth as io require splitting. 
When they are very large, they look very pretty 
cut into lozenges ; in this case they are not split. 

Green Peas. (No. 134.) 

Young green peas well dressed, are one of the 
most delicious delicacies of the vegetable kingdom. 
They must be young, or no art can boil them ten- 
der l it is equally indispensable that they be fresh 
gathered, and cooked as soon as they are shelled, 
for, by being exposed to the air, they soon lose 
both their colour and sweetness, and if you wisb 
to feast upon peas in perfection, you must have 
them gathered the same day they are dressed, and 

* If you wish to have them very green, when they are done 
throw tliem instantly into cold water; when you wish to send 
them to table, warm them again in a tureen of boiling 
water. 



VEGETABLES. 

put on to boil within half an hour after they are 
shelled. Pass them through a coarse sieve, which 
is made for the purpose. This precaution of se- 
parating them is necessary, for large and small peas 
cannot be boiled together, as, ofcourse, the former 
will take more time than the latter. For a peck of 
peas, set on a saucepan with a gallon of water in it ; 
when it boils, put in your peas with a tablespoonful 
of salt, and two teaspoonsful of lump sugar ; keep 
them boiling quick from twenty to thirty minutes, 
according to their age and size : the best way to 
judge of their being done enough, and indeed, the 
only way to make sure of cooking them so, and 
not beyond the point of perfection, as the pea 
eaters say of boiling them to a bubble," is to 
take some out with your spoon and taste them. 
When they are enough, drain them on a hair 
sieve, put them into a pye dish, divide some 
butter into small bits, and lay them on the peas ; 
put another dish over them, and turn them over ; 
this will melt the butter through them, and is by 
far the best way of buttering peas. 

Obs, — You may boil a few sprigs of mint in a 
vsaucepan by themselves, and garnish your dish of 
peas with them : see Pea Powder, 

Cucumber Stexved. (No. 135.) 

Peel and cut your cucumbers into slices nearly 
a quarter of an inch thick ; flonr and dry them in 
butter ; let the butter be quite hot before you put 
in the cucumbers ; fry some sliced onions with 
them till they are a delicate light brown colour, 
then put them into a stewpan, with as mucb gravy 



VEGETABLES. 

ns v/ill cover ihcm ; stew slowly till they are tender; 
tills will take about an hour : take out the cucum- 
bers wi{h a slice, thicken the gravy with flour 
and butler, give it a boil up, and season it with 
pepper and salf, put the cucumber in to warm, 
and it is ready. 

Obs. — The relish of this dish is sometimes aug- 
mented by the addition of bay leaves, anchovies, 
wine, ale, and the savoury spices.- 

Artichokes, (No. ]S6.) 

Wrench out the stalk close to the bottom, by 
which the fibres will be drawn out, put them 
into cold water, and wash them well, then 
put them into plenty of boiling water, with a 
handful of salt, and let them boil gently till they 
are tender, which will take an houi* and a half, or 
two hours ; drain them on a sieve ; and send up 
melted butter with them. 



Stexo Onions. (No.- 1 37.) 

The large Portugal onions are the best for this 
purpose ; takeoff the coats of half a dozen of these, 
taking care not to cut off the tops or tails too near, 
or the onions will go to pieces; put them into a 
stewpan big enough to hold them without laying 
them a top of one another; just cover them with 
good broth ; as soon as it boils fast, add to them 
half an ounce of lump sugar, put. them on a very 
slow fire, and let it simmer two hours, till the 
broth is reduced to a glaze; when you disii

over thera. 
This is a very elegant preparation of onions. 

Roast Onions, (No. 138.) 

Tliey are done best in a Dutch oven, turning 
them occasionally, that they may be done equally 
on all sides. 



FISH. 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 



This department of the business of the kitcjien 
depends more upon practice than any other; a 
very few moments too much or too little, and the 
fish is spoilt. So many circumstances operate oa 
this occasion, it is almost impossible to write rules 
that are generally applicable. There are de- 
cidedly different opinions^ whether the water 
should be cold, tepid, or boiling. The Dutch, 
who are famous for dressing fish, always use the 
latter. See No. 141. We believe for some of the 
fame the Dutch cooks have acquired they are 
a little indebted to their situation enabling them 
io always have fisli in perfection; and that the su- 
perior excellence of the fish in Holland, is because 
none are used, unless they are brought alive into 
the kitchen, (except mackerel, which die the 
moment they are taken out of the water.) The 
Dutch are as nice about this as, Seneca says, the 



FISH. 

Romans were; who, complaining of (he luxury 
of the limes, says, they are come to that dainti- 
ness, they will not eat a fish, unless upon the 
same day that it is taken, that it may taste of tlie 
sea, as they express it. 

On the Dutch flat coast, the fish are all taken 
with nets ; whereas, on our rocky coast, fish are 
mostly caught by bait and hook, which imme- 
diately kills them. The fish are brought alive by 
land, to the Dutch markets in water-casks with air 
holes in the top. Salmon, and other fish, is thus 
preserved in rivers, in a well-hole, in the fishing 
boat. 

The good folks of this metropolis are so often 
disappointed, by having fish which have been 
kept too long, tliey are apt to run into the other 
extreme, and suppose no fish will either dress 
well, or eat well, unless it is quite alive. Some 
very respectable fishmongers have, however, 
assured the editor, that they are oftener in danger 
of losing their credit, by selling fish too fresh, and 
that especially turbot and cod must be kept a day 
or so after they are dead, before they will eat 
well; and, like meat, require a certain time 
before they are in the best condition to be dressed : 
then they recommend them to be put into water, 
(salted in proportion of half a pint of salt to a gal-

Ion of water,) that you should have JQst stopped 
the boiling of, bj pouring in, just before you put 
in the fish, a pint of cold water, and let them boil 
slowly till done. 



F I S II. 



Turhot to Boil. (No. 140.) 

Clean and wash a nice white tiirbot, cut it 
across the thickest part of the underside ; this 
is to prevent it breaking on the breast, which 
happens from the fish swelling", and cracking the 
skin, if this precaution is not used : lay it in a 
fish kettle, with the white side upwards ; put 
a large handful of salt on it, cover it with 
cold spring water, set it on a hot fire till it boils, 
skim it carefully, and set it on the side of the fire, 
to boil gently for about twenty minutes, (if it boils 
fast, the fish will break to pieces;) supposing the 
fish to weigh eight or nine pounds ; for sixteen 
or eighteen pounds, an hour. Send it up on a 
fish-drainer, garnished with sprigs of green pars- 
ley. Save a little of the inside coral spawn of the 
lobster, rub it through a hair sieve, without butter. 
When the turbot is dished, sprinkle the spawn 
over it. Garnish the dish with sprigs of curled 
parsley, sliced lemon, and finely scraped horse- 
radish ; and, if you like to send it to table in full 
dressed, surround it with some nicely fried smelts. 
Send up lobster sauce (see receipt, No. 294,) 
in a boat, or two boats, if it is for a large party. 

Dutch method of Boiling Turbot. (No. 141.) 
In boiling a large turbot, four or Hwq handfuls 



FISH 

of salt are put into tlie water it is to be boiled in ; 
which strong brine makes the fish crimp and 
savoury ; the thick parts of the fish are cut, or 
scored, to admit the salt water. The salt must be 
put into cold water ; but before the fish is put in, 
the water must boil strongly. A large turbot will 
be well boiled in half an hour. (From Mr. Twiss 
Ihe traveller,) 

Turbot to Fry, (No. 142.) 

Clean a small turbot well, and dry it in a cloth, 
beat an ^g^ on a plate ten minutes, wash the fish 
all over with the ^gg, then cover it with fine bread 
crumbs, that have been rubbed through a hair 
sieve : have some clean lard, or dripping in an iron 
fryingpan, over a hot fire ; when it has done talking, 
and. is quite still, put the fish in ; in about four 
minutes turn it, and fry it on the other side ; w hen 
done, lay it on a hair sieve, to drain the fat 
from it. 

Lobster or shrimp sauce. 

A Brill (No. 143.) 
Is dressed the same way as a turbot. 

Soles to Boil, (No. 144.) 

Wash and clean your soles well, put them into 
a fish-kettle, with a handful of salt, and as much 
cold spring water as will cover them ; put them on a 
quick fire, and when they boil, set them on the 
side of the fire to boil gently ien minutes ; that 
will be long enough, unless they be very large. 



FISH. 

Send them up on a fish-drainer, garnished with 
sprigs of parsley, 

Obs. — Slices of lemon are a very universally 
acceptable garnish, with either fried or boiled 
fish ; a few sprigs of crisp parsley may be added, 
if you wish to make it look very smart. 

Soles to Fry, (No. 145.) 

Be sure your soles are quite fresh ^ or all the 
good cooks in the world cannot make them either 
look or eat well. An hour before you intend to dress 
them, wash them thoroughly, and wrap them in 
a clean cloth, to make them perfectly dry, or the 
bread crumbs will not stick to them. Beat the 
yolk and white of an eg^ well together, on a plate, 
with a fork ; flour your fish, to absorb any mois- 
ture that may remain, and wipe it oft* with a clean 
cloth : dip them in the egg on both sides all over ; 
or, what is better, egg them with a paste-brush, 
rub some stale bread through a cullender, or hair 
sieve, strew it all over the fish, so that it covers 
every part, and take up the fish by the head, and 
shake off" the loose crumbs. The sole is now 
ready for the fryingpan. 

Put a pint or more of fresh sweet olive oil, or a 
pound ofiard*, or beef suet, (the fat ought to cover 
the fish ; what we here order, is for a middling- 
sized pair of soles,) into a fryingpan, over a sharp 
and clear fire; watch it, and when it boils, i. e. when 
it has done bubbling, and is still, and the smoke 

* The. fat will do two or three times, if strained through a 
hair sieve, and put by ; if you do not find it enough, put a 
little fresh to it. 



FISH. 

just begins to rise from tbe surface, (if the fat is 
not extremely hot, it is impossible to fry fish of a 
,£:oocl colour, or to make them firm and crisp. 
The best way to ascertain the heat of the fat, is to 
try it with a bit of bread as big as a nut, if it is 
quite hot encTugh, the bread will be brown imme- 
diately,) put in the fish, it will be crisp and 
bro^^n on the side next the fire, in about four or 
five minutes ; to turn it, stick a two pronged fork 
jiear the head, and support the tail with a fish- 
slice, and fry the other side : one sole is enough 
to put in at a time, except the pan is very large, 
and you have plenty of fat. When your fish are 
fried, lay them on whited brown paper, on a hair 
sieve, placed slanting, and near enough the fire to 
keep thera warm, till the fat is thoroughly drained 
from them ; this will take five or ten minutes* 
When soles are fried, they will keep very good 
in a dry place for four days, and eat as well as 
when fresh dressed, if you warm them in a Dutch 
oven, or in good gravy. 

Obs. — ^There are several general rules in this re- 
ceipt which apply to all fried fish : we have been 
very particular and minute in our directions ; for, 
although a fried sole is a very frequent and 
favourite dish, it is very seldom brought to table 
in perfection. Batter will occasionally supply the 
place of egg ; and biscuit, powder of bread 
crumbs : the latter is sold at KusselPs excellent 
biscuit shop, nearly opposite Villiers Street in the 
Strand *. 

• The very indifferent manner in which the operation of 
/"rying fish is usually performed, we suppose produced the 
following jew d' esprit, \^hich appeared a few months since

Soles to Stew, (No. 146.) 

These are done the same as eels, Wiggy s way, 
in good gravy. See JSo. 104. 

Fillets of Soles Fried, (No. 147.) 

Take Ihe fillets of a pair of good soles, trim 
them neatly, and wipe them on a dry cloth ; beat 
Xhe yolk and white of an esfg together on a plat6 
for tive minutes, dip the fillets into the Ggg^ and 
then into fine stale bread crumbs, that have been 
rubbed through a hair sieve. Ilave some clean 
lard hot in an iron fryingpan; put in the fillets and 
fry them of a fine brown colour ; lay them on a 
hair sieve as you do them, and keep (hem hot 
before the fire till the following sauce is ready. 

Make half a pint of good melCed butter squeeze 
in the juice of a lemon, lay the fillets of soles round 
the dish, and pour the sauce into the middle. 

Fillets of Soles, Jlliite, (No. 148.) 

Take off the fillets, trim them, and cut them in 
two ; butter a clean earthen dish oi' pan, lay the 
fillets in it, and butter a paper cut to the size of 
the dish, and lay it close to the fillets, set it in a 
cool oven, or over a very slow fire, for about fif- 
teen or twenty minutes; take them up, and dry 

in that ably conducted daily register, " The Morning Chro- 
nicle."

Ccd BgUccL (No. 149.) 

Clean and wash your f^sh, and rub a little salt 
in the inside of it ; iHhe weather is verj cold, a 
large cod is always tlie better for bein<^ kept a 
day: put plenty of water in your lish-kettle, so 
that the tish may be well covered^ put in a hand- 
ful of salt: when the water boils, stop its boiling 
hy pouring in a pint of cold water, and theu put 
in your tish ; a very small fish will require from 
twenty to thirty minut/?s, a very large one near 
an hour; drain it on the fish-plate ; dish it with 
garnish of the roe, liver, chilterling, &c. 

Sail Fish Boiled, (No. 150.) 

Salted fish requires soaking, according to ihe 
time it luis been in salt; that whicli is hard and 
dry requires two nights soaking ; the intermediate 
(hiy lay it on a stone floor ; for (be barrelled cod, 
less time will do ; and for the best Dogger Bank 
split lish, which has not been more than a fort- 
night or three weeks in salt, less time will be 
needful. Put it on in cold water. 

Slices of Cod Boiled. (No. 151.) 

Lay the slice of fish at the bottom of a fish- 
kettle, with as much cold spring water as will 
cover it, and a large handtul of salt ; set it on a 
quick fire, and when it boils, set it on one side of 
the fire to boil gently, for ten minutes, or a quar- 



FiSH.

Garnisli with a slice of the liver on one side, and 
chitterlings on the other. Ojster sauce and plaia

Codlings Broiled. (No. 152.) 

Wash them well, dry them in a cloth, l3cat an 
egi^ on a plate well, dip tlie fish in tiie egg, and 
tlien flonr them all over; lay them on a clean 
gridiron over a slow and clear lire ; when they 
are done on one side, turn them gently ; they will 
take about ivt^nij minutes, or half an hour. An- 
chovy sauce. 

niiitings Fried, (No. 1 5 3.) 

Skin them, and fasten their tails to their 
mouths; dip them in G^g^ and then in bread 
crumbs, and fry them in hot lard ; lay them in 
the pan with their backs towards the fire, and let 
the fat boil over them, but do not turn them, they 
are more liable to break than any fish. 

Ohs. — When whitings are very scarce and 
dear, the fishmongers can skin aud truss young 
codlings, so ^hat you can hardly tell the differ- 
ence. A codling has a beard under its mouth, 
which a whiting has not : this distinguishing 
mark is sometime* cut off; however, if you look, 
you will soon see the mark where the beard was, 
and thus discover if it is a whiting or a shaved 
codling. 

Skate Fried. (No. 154.) 

After you have cleaned them thoroughly, 
f2 



FISH* 

divide it into fillets, dry tliem on a clean cloth ; beat 
the yolk and white of an egg together on a plate 
for tive minutes, dip the fish in this, and then in 
fine bread crumbs ; fry it in hot lard or drippings 
till they are of a beautiful brown colour ; lay 
them on a hair sieve to drain ; garnish with crisp 
parsley. 

Plaice or Flounders Fried, (No. 155.) 

Clean them well, and wipe them on-a dry cloth 
to absorb all the water from them ; flour them and 
fry- them in hot lard, and send them up with 
plain butter in a boat, or anchovy sauce. 

JVater Souchy, (No. \56,) 

This, I believe, is a Dutch dish, and is made 
of several small fish, such as flounders, plaice, 
whiting, gudgeons, eels, or percli ; these must be 
very fresh, and very clean, for what they are 
boiled in is sent up with them : cut noches in 
your iish and throw them into fresh spring water ; 
(this is what is called crimping fish) ; put them 
into a stewpan with as much water as you think 
will fill the dish, with some parsley leaves and 
parsley roots, a glass of white wine, and a table- 
spoonful of vinegar, and as much salt as you 
would for broth ; take care to skim it well when 
it boils ; when your fish is done enough, send it 
up in a deep dish, with some slices of bread and 
butter on a plate. 

Haddocks Boiled. (No. \57.) 
"Wash it well, and put it on to boil in as much 



FISH. 

cold water as will cover it, with plenty of salt in 
it; a haddock of three pounds will take twenty 
minutes after it boils. These are sometimes stuf- 
fed with the same stutfing you put to veal. 

Carp to SteziK (No. 158.) 

\\^hen your fish has been properly washed, lay 
it in a tish kettle, with a pint of port wine and 
about as much water as will half cover it; a bay 
leaf, a carrot, a large onion, a head of celery, a 
dozen berries of black pepper, the same of all- 
spice, aid an ounce of lean ham ; cover the- fish 
kettle close, and let it stew gendy for half an hour; 
take the fish up, lay it on a hot dish, and thicken 
the liquor that it was boiled in with flour; season 
with pepper, salt, and a little grated nutmeg; 
when it has boiled ten minutes, strain it through 
a tammis into a clean stewpan, make it very hot, 
and pour it over the fish ; if there is more sauce 
than the dish will hold, send the rest up in a boat. 

Perch Fried. (No. 159.) 

Wash the fish well, and wipe them on a dry 
cloth, flour them lightly all over, and frj^ them 
ten minutes in hot lard or drippings; when they 
are fried, lay them on a hair sieve to drain ; send 
them up on a hot dish : garnish with sprigs of 
green parsley. Anchovy sauce. 

Perch Boiled, (No. 160.) 

Clean them carefully, and put them in a fish 
kettle, with as much cold spring water as will

cover Ihera, with a Landful of salt; set them on a 
quick fire till they boil ; when they boil, set them 
on one side to boil gently for ten minutes. 

Salmofi Pickkcl (No. 161.) 

Cut a salmon into pieces and put it into a fish 
ketlle, with a large handful of salt, and cold spiting 
wa(er enough to cover it ; when it boils set it on 
one side of the tire <o boil gently half an- hourr; 
when it is enough, dry it on a clean cloth. - 

Put the top of the salmon liquor into a stewpan, 
to which add the same quantity of white wine 
vinegar, a quarter of an ounce of whole pepper, 
the same of allspice, and two bay leaves; set it 
on the lire to boil i^w minutes ; skim it well ; 
take it off the fire, and when it is cold, pour it 
over the fish and tie it down ; in three days it may 
be turned , and in a week it will be fit for eating, 
and will remain so for several months. Garnish 
with sprigs of fennel. 

Obs. — This is in the finest condition when fresh 
salmon is most plentiful about Midsummer; the 
season for it is from February to September*. 

Salmon Boiled. (No. 162.) 

Put on a fish kettle, with as much spring water 
as will cover the salmon you are going to dress. 
When the water boils, put in a large handful of 



* The three marlis of the goodness of pickled snirnon are, 
1st- The hriglrness of the scales, and their sticking fast to the

colour. 



FISH. 

Kilt, lake off the scum, if any rises, have the fish 
well washed, put it in, and let it boil half an hour. 

Salmon Broiled. (No. 1G3.) 

Clean the salmon well, and cut it into slices 
ih>(je inches thick, dry it thoroughly in a clean 
-cloth, and rub it all over with sweet oil, or thick 
melted butter, and sprinkle a little salt over it ; 
put/yatir i^ridiron over a clear lire, at some dis- 
tance ; when it is hot, wipe it clean, and then rub 
h with sweet oil or lard ; lay the salmon on, and 
when it is done on one side, turn it gently and broil 
the other side. Anchovy sauce. 

Eels Stezvecl IViggys zvai/. (No. 1 64.) 

" Take two pounds of fine silver* eels ; the best 
size are those that are not much less than a three- 
shilling piece in circumference, quile fresh, full 
of life, and as brisk as an eel ; such as have br^ea 
kept out of water till they can scarce stir, are 
-good for nothing. Gut them and rub them with 
salt till the slime is cleaned from them, wash them 
in three different waters, and divide them into 
pieces about four inchejs long : you mny season 
them with salt, and beaten mace or nutmeg, and 
then egg and bread crumb them ; dredge them 
with a little flour, and fry them in drippings till 
they are brown j lay them to dry on a hair sieve. 

* The yellow eels are apt to taste muddy; the wliiteness 
of the belly of the fish, is not the only niarii to know the btst; 
the right colour of the back is ii coppery hue, very biis^ht; the 
olive coloured are inferior; and those tending to a greeu are 
worse. 

F 4 



FTSil. 

Have ready a quart of good beef gravy ; it must 
be quite cold when you put the eels into it, or the 
skill of (lie eels will crack, and the beauty of this 
disli consists in sending Ihem up whole : set them 
on a slow fire till they boil, then put them by the 
side of the fire to simmer very gently for a quarter 
of an hour, take them out of the stewpan with a 
fish slice, be careful not to bruise their skins, lay 
them on a dish about two inches deep, mix two 
teaspoorisful of flour with two tablespoons ful of 
port wine, stir it into the sauce by degrees, and 
strain it over the fish through a tammis sieve. 

Obs. — To kill eels instantly, without the horrid 
torture of cutting and skinning them alive, pierce 
the spinal marrow close to the back part of tlie 
skull with a sharp pointed skewer : it' this be done 
in the right place, all motion will instantly cease. 

To fry Eds. (No. 165.) 

Skin and gut them, and wash them well in cold 
water, cut them in pieces four inches long, season 
them with pepper and salt, beat an egg well on a 
plate, dip them in the egg^ and then in fine bread 
crumbs ; fry them in fresh clean lard, drain them 
"well from the fat, garnish with crisp parsley ; for 
sauce, plain melted butter, with the juice of half 
a lemon in it. 

Spit chcockcd Eels. (No. \G6!) 

This the French cooks call the English way of 
dressing eels, and though not of their own inven- 
tion, they frequently se«id it up to the best tables. 

Take two middling-sized fine silver eels^ leave 



the skin on, cut off the heads, slit them on the 
belly side, and take out the bone and guts, and 
■wash and wipe them nicely, and then cut them 
into pieces about three inches long, wipe them 
quite dry, put two ounces of butter into a stewpan 
with a little minced parsley, thyme, sage, pepper, 
and salt, and a very little chopped shallot ; set the 
stewpan over the fire ; when the butter is melted, 
stir the ingredients together, and take it off the 
fire, mix the yolks of two eggs with them, and 
dip the eel in, a piece at a time, and then roll 
them in bread crumbs, making as much stick to 
them as you can ; then rub a gridiron with a bit of 
suet, set it liigh over a very clear fire, and broil 
your eels of a fine crisp brown : dish them with 
crisp parsley, and send up plain butter in a boat, 
and anchovy and butter. 

Obs, — We like them better with the skin off; 
it is very apt to offend delicate stomachs. 

Mackarel Boiled, (No. I67.) 

This fish loses its life as soon as it leaves the sea^ 
and the fresher it is the better. They are very 
tender fish, and the less you handle them the bet- 
ter. Wash and clean them thoroughly, put 
them into cold water with a handful of salt in it ; 
be careful not to let them boil, but only simmer 
about ten minutes, till they are enough, which you 
will discover by their beginning to split at the tail ; 
do not let them stand in the water after they are 
done, being so delicate that the beat of the water 
will break them. This fish rarely appears at table 
in perfection; either the mackarel is boiled too 
much, or the roe too little. The best way is to 
p5 



FISH,' 

open a slit opf)osIte the middle of (he voe ; tliis 
■will allow the water access, and Ihe roe will then be 
done as soon as the fish, which it is seldom other- 
wise ; and some sagacions s:ourmand€ insist upon 
it they must be taken out and boiled separately. 

Mackarel Soused. (No. 168.) 

After boiling them as above directed, put into 
the bquor they were boiled in a few peppercorns^ 
some salt, and half as much vinegar, boil up 
together, and when the macliarel are cold pour 
this over them. There must be enough of it to 
cover them completely. They will be good in two 
days, and keep so a fortnight. Send them to table 
garnished with sprigs of fennel. 

Mackarel Broiled. (No. I69.) 

Clean a fine large mackarel, wipe it on a dry 
cloth, and cut a long slit down the back ; fill it 
with parsley and fennel, equal quantities of each 
minced fine, season it with pepper and salt and a 
little butter, oil it on both sides, and lay it on 
a clean gridiron over a very clear slow fire ; when 
it is done on one side turn it, but be careful that 
it does not burn ; send it up with fennel sauce in a 
boat, or plain butter with mushroom catsup or soy 
in it. 

Mackarel Baked. (No. 170.) 

Cut off their heads, open them, and take out 
the roes, and clean them thoroughly, rub them on 
the inside with a little pepper and salt, put the 



FISH. 

roes in again, season tliera (with a mixture of 
po'.vdered allspice, black pepper and salt, well 
rubbed together) on both sides, and hiy them close 
in a bakinsrpan, lay a couple of bay leaves on the 
top, cover them with equal quantities of coll viru^- 
gar and water, tie them down with strong white 
paper doubled, bake them for an hour in a slow 
Qven. They will keep for a fortnight. 

Mackarel Pickled. (No. 171 .) 

Procure them as fresh as possible, split them 
open, take off the heads, and trim off all the tliin 
part of the belly, put them into salt and water for 
one hour, drain and wipe your fish, and put 
them into jars or casks, with the following prepa- 
rntion. Take salt and bay salt, one pound each,

pepper, half an ounce, and cardaiiium seeds, one

layer of the preparation at the bottom, then a layer 
of mackarel wilh the skin side downwards ; so 
continue alternately till the cask or jar is full; 
press it down and cover it close. In six months 
they will be fine, and fit for use, and will keep for 
a couple of years, or more, in prime condition, 
and the flavour will be delicious.

Herrings Broiled. (No. 171.)* 

Wash them well, and then dry them with a 
cloth, dust them with flour, and broil them over a 
slow fire till they are well done. Send up good 
melted butter in a boat. 

Herrings Soused. (No. 172.) 

Cut off the heads of two dozen fine fresh her- 
rings, open and wash them very clean, season 
them with salt, allspice, and black pepper, put 
them into a pot, and cover them with white wine, 
vinegar and water, equal parts of each, tie the 
pot up close, and set it in a slow oven to bake for 
two hours. They will keep a month or six weeks. 

Smelts Fried, (No. 173.) 

Clean and dry them thoroughly in a cloth, beat 
an egg on a plate, and dip them in it, then in fine 
bread crumbs that have been rubbed through a 
sieve ; fry them in clean lard ; as soon as the lard 
boils and is still, put in the fish. It will take 
about five minutes to give them a fine gold colour. 
Drain them on a hair sieve. When quite dried, 
send tliem up on a hot dish, with shrimp sauce in 
a boat.

Potted Shrimps, or Prazvns, (No. 175.) 

When 3'ou have picked them, powder them 
with a little beaten mace, grated nutmeg", white 
pepper and salt, add a little cold butter, and pound 
all well together in a marble mortar till it is the 
consistence of paste. Put it into pots covered 
with clarified butter. 

Lobster, (No. 17^.) 

Always buy them alive, for those who sell them 
sometimes keep them too long before they boil 
them, and they then have not half their flavour. 
Choose those that are full of motion, which is the 
index of their freshness. The heaviest are gene- 
rally the best, and those of a middle size. Never 
take them when the shell is encrusted, which is a 
sign they are old. The male lobster is preferred 
to eat, aud the female on account of her eggs to 
make sauce of. The female lobster is distinguished 
by having a broader tail than the male, and less 
claws. Set on a pot of water with a tablespoonful of 
salt in it, Iiaving tied the tail of the lobster fast to 
the body, when the water boils put it in, and, if very 
large, keep it boiling briskly for half an hour ; 
wipe all the skura off it, and set it by till it is

Select fine hen lobsters when full of spawn, boil 
them thorou£,rhly, pick out all the 'eatable parts,^ 
and pound them in n mortar, adding to them by ' 
degrees finely pounded mace, black pepper, salt, 
and a litt!- clarified butter. When the whole is

bacon, and bake it for an hour and a half. Let it 
remain till cold. When you wish to sijet it out, 
put the mould in warm water a few minutes, and 
it will come out- Take away the bacon. Send

butter, pepper, salt, and nutmeg, to your taste, beat 
the whole well together, put it in a basin or mould 
to boil an hour.

the lobster pounded in a mortar, with a little but-

Christmas. 

Soreeofthe amateurs of oysters think they are 
not best when quite fresh from the sea ; the flavour 
they have is too brackish and harsh, wliich is 
much ameliorated by giving them a feed, by 
covering them with clean water, with a pint of 
salt to about two gallons ; (nothing else, no oat- 
meal, nor any other trumpery ;) this will cleanse 
them from the mud and sand, &c. of the bed ; 
after they have lain in it twelve hours, change it 
for fresh salt and water, and in twelve hours niore^ 
they will be in prime order for the mouth, and 
remain so two or three days : at the time ot high 
water, you may see them open their shells, 
in expectation of receiving their usual food. This 
process of 1 ceding oysters, is only employed 
when a great many come up together in their dirt, 
&c. The real Colchester, or Py fleet barrelled 
oysters, that are packed at the beds, are bet-, 
tcr without being put in water ;. they are care-: 
fully and tightly packed, and must not be dis- 
turbed till wanted for table : these, in moderate 
weather, will keep good for a week, or ten days.

enlii^htened eyes of the experienced oyster eater. 

Those who wish to enjoy this delicious restora- 
tive in its utmost perfection, must eat it the 
moment it is opened, with its own gravy in the 
under shell: if not eaten while absolutely alive, 
its flavour and spirit is lost. The true lover of an 
oyster will have more regard for the feelings of his 
little favourite, than to abandon it to. the mercy of 
a bungling operator, but will always open it him- 
self, afid contrive to detach the fisii from the shell 
so dexterously, that the oyster is hardly conscious 
I)c has been ejected from his lodging, till he feels 
the teeth of the gourmand ticklitig him to death. 

Scolloped Ousters. (No. 182) 

Parboil twenty-four oysters in as mucli water as

Beard and wash the oysters, and let them stew 
slowly for a few minutes in the above liquor, put

Fishmonger, Great Russel Street, Bloorasbury. 

" Sir, " Oct. 18,1816.'* 

" In speaking of the different seasons of fish, I 
do not mean to say that you caniiot get good or 
bad, except at the times I have mentioned, as 
they frequently will vary ; for instance, there may 
be a good cod in the midst of summer, or a good 
turbot in the midst of winter; and I have only 
pointed out the time when they are generally so. 
" Tliere is no article so fluctuating in price as 
fish, the London market being supplied princi* 
pally by water carriage, from -all parts of the coast, 
the wind cannot be fair for all; the consequence 
then is, frequently a great abiuidance of some 
sorts, and none, or little, of many others. A 



FISH. 

great many persons send their servants to market 
to get, perhaps, a turbot, or cod's head and shoul- 
ders ; it very likely happens those articles are 
scarce and extravagant : the servants have no 
other order, or perhaps will not take the trouble 
to get other orders, but order a turbot at SOy. 
or 40^., whereas they might have as good a dish 
of any other sort for half the money. In this 
case the tr;iJesinan is frequently condemned as 
an extravagant fellow, when, perhaps, he gets 
nothing by selling it. I am therefore convinced 
Xhat it is people's own fault that they have fish 
at such an extravagant price: if masters or mis- 
tresses were to go to market the inselves, if one 
sort was dear, they could have another; or, if not 
convenient to go themselves, desire their fisli- 
mo/iger to send them a handsome dish, the most 
seasonable and reasonable, for so many per- 
sons ; and if that tradesman did not nse thena 
well, he is not deserving of their custom." 



'^ Cod generally comes into good season in 
October, when, if the weather is cold, it eats as 
fine as at any time in tlie year : towards the latter 
end of January, and February, and part of IMarch, 
they are mostly poor, but the latter end of March, 
April, and May, they arc generally particularly 
fine, having shot their spawn, they come in fine 
order. The Dogger-Bank cod are the most 
esteemed, as they generally cut in large fine 
flakes ; the north country cod, that is caught off the 
Orkney isles, are generally very stringy, or what 
is commonly called woolley, and sell at a very 



FISH. 

inferior prire, but are caught iu much gr-eatcr 
abundance than the Dogger cod. The cod arc all 
caught witli hook, and brought alive in well boats 
to the London markets. Tiie eod cured on the 
Dogger Bank is remarkably fine, and seldom 
cured above two or three weeks before brouglit 
to market ; tlie barrel cod is commonly cured ou 
the coast of Scotland and Yorkshire. There is a 
great deal of inferior cured salt fish brought f-'om 
Newfoundland and Ireland. The skull of a 
Dogger Bank cod is a famous dish for an epicure, 
it being the richest and most luscious part of the 
fish ; one of Ihem is a good dish for tlirce or four 
persons, and eats well either baked or boiled : the 
tail of a cod should always be cut in fillets or 
slices, and fried, which makes a good dish, and 
generally to be bought at a very reasonable rate; 
it' boiled, it is always soft and watery. The skull 
and tail of a cod makes an excellent Scotch dish, 
stewed and served up together, with anchovies, or 
oyster sauce, with the liquor it is boiled in, iu 
the tureen. 

*' Ling is brought to the London market in the 
same manner as cod, but is very inferior to it 
either fresh or salt, 

'" Turbots, The finest turbots that are brought to 
the London market, are caught ofi'the Dutch coast, 
or German ocean, and are brought iu well boats 
alive. The commencement of the season is gene- 
rally about March and April, and continues all 
the summer season. Turbots, like other fish, 
do not spawn all at the same time; therefore 
there is always good and bad nearly all ilic year 
round. For this year or tv/o past, there has been 
an immense quantity brought to London, from all 
parts, and of all qualities ; a great many from a 



FISH. 

new fishery off Hartlepool, which are a very 
handsome looking turbot, but by no means equal 
to what are caught off the Dutch coast. A great 
many excellent turbots are caught off Dover and 
Dungeness; and a large quantity brought from 
Scotland, packc^d in ice, which are of a very 
inferior quality, and are generally to be bought 
for about one fourth the price of good turbots. 

" Brills are generally caught at the same place 
as turbots, and are generally of the same quality as 
the turbot, from the different parts. Some brills 
are very good, but not equal to turbot. 

'' Salmo7i. The earliest that comes in season to 
Ihe London market, is brought from the Severn, 
and begins to come into season the beginning of 
Isovember, but very few so early, perhaps not 
above one in fifty, as many of them will not shoot 
their spawn till January, or after, and then con- 
tinue in season till October, when they begin to 
get very thin and poor. The principal supply of 
salmon is from different parts of Scotland, packed 
in ice, and brought by water : if the vessels have 
a fair wind, Ihey will be in London in three days ; 
but it frequently happens they are at sea perhaps 
a fortnight, when the greater part of the tish is 
perished, some tolerable good, and some of all 
qualities, and has, for a year or two past, sold 
as low as two pence per pound, and up to as much 
as eighteen pence per pound at the same time, 
owing to its different degrees of goodness. 

" Salmon GzciltSy or Salmon Peel, are the small 
salmon which come from about 5 or 6 pounds 
to ten pounds, are very good fijsh, and make 
handsome dishes of fish, and sent to table crooked 
in the form of an S. 



TXSH. 

'* Berwick Trout are a distinct fisli from the 
gwilts, and are caught in (he Kivcr Tweed, aijd 
dressed in the same manner as the gvvilt. 

" Cakcred Salmon is the salmon canght in <he 
Thames, and cut into slices alive; and some few 
salmon are brought from Oxford to London alive, 
and cut. A few slices makes a handsome, genteel 
dish, but is generally very expensive. 

*^ Mnchirel generally make their appearance off 
the Land's End about the beginning of April, and 
as. the weather gets warm they gradually come 
round the coast, "and generally arrive off Brighton 
about May, and continue for some months, until 
they begin to shoot their spawn, when for above 
two months they are missing, until about Michael- 
mas, when there is a few very fat small mackarel of 
excellent flavour at this time make their appear- 
ance again. 

" Dutch Plaice, when in season, and what are 
caught off the Dutch coast, are good iSsh either 
fried or boiled : they are frequently condemned 
as a bad fish, because they do not eat so firm as a.., 
(urbot or brills, which is not their nature; hu% 
they are very rich nutritious fish, more so than 
turbot ; but what are caught on our own coast 
are nothing equal to the others. 

" Sales are a fish that are generally to be pro- 
cured good from some part of the coast, as some 
are goinir out of season, and some coming in, 
both at the same time ; a great many are brought 
in ^H^U-boats, alive, that are caught off Dover, 
and Folkstone, and some are brought from the 
same places by land carriage. The soles that are 
caught on that part of the coast are rather small, 
but exceeding good fish. The finest soles that

arc caug?it any where, are tliose that are off Ply-' 
mouth, near the Eddistone, and all Ijic way up 
the Channel, and to Torbciy; it being very deep 
water, and the ground a fine gravelly bottom, 
Ihey fe^d very solid, and are caught frequently 
very large, eight or ien pounds per])air: tliey 
are generally brought by water to Portsmouth, 
and thence by land; but the greatest quantity 
are caught oiT Yarmouth and the Knole, and a 
great many are caught off the Forelands. 

" Red MuUets are a very delicious fish, com- 
morfly called the sea woodcock, they b^ing dres- 
sed with their entrails in, there being no gut, only 
like a string, which is like marrow itself; they 
only require scraping; washed tenderly with a 
cloth, and broiled in a buttered paper: they are 
so rich, i\\Qj require scarcely any sauce. The 
best are caught off Plymouth, and all the way up 
the channel to Portland, and some few off Brigh- 
ton. 

'' Grai/ MulletSy when in season, are very rich, 
good fish, but not equal to the red : those gene- 
rally keep in the season near the fresh water* 
The b( st way of dressing those, is by baking them 
in a pye, or roasting, or baking them, with a 
pudding in their belly, and put in a tureen with 
some good gravy, and they cat very fine. 

*' John Doreijs are a very good fish, cutting very 
wliite and firm, equal to a turbot in firmness, but 
not in richness : those caught, off Plymouth and. 
Torbay are the best. Lobster is requisite fot 
sauce. J 

'' Whitings are a very delicate fish, and recjuire 
to be eaten very fresh ; those caught off Dover and 



FI5H. 

Folksione are the best ; socce arc brought alive, 
and some by land carriage. 

*' Skate is a very gxxxi fish when in good seasorr, 
but no fish so bad when it is other\>ise : those per- 
sons that like it finn and dry. should have it 
crimped : buitho-e that like it tender, should have 
it plain, and eat not earlier than the second day. 
and it" cold weather, three or four days ohi it is 
belter : it cannot Ije kept too long, if periectly 
sweet. Skate, if young, eats very line, crimped 
and fried. 

• Hnddoch are a firm, good fish ; they are dres- 
sed many different ways. Large haddocks boiled, 
and oyster sauce. Haddocks salted a day or two, 
and eaten with e^<: sance, are a very £:ood article. 
Haddocks cut in fillets, and fried, cat very fine. 
Or if small, very well broiled, or baked with 
a pudding in their belly, and some good gravy. 

'• Fi-Tfh Sturgeon is esteemed a good fish by 
many ; but. I believe, only because it d^^es not 
come plentiful enough to be common ; and to the 
eater of tish it makes a change : as many gentle- 
men cannot dir>e without fish, it makes a variety, 
or becomes useful, where people want to give a 
course offish entirely : a piece stewed wiili some 
gcMxl gravy is the best way of dressing : or cut in 
slices, and fried, as you would a veal cutlet, eats 
very well. Sturgeon pickled, makes a handsome 
winter dish for the second course. 

'*' Sjfielts are allowed to be caught in the 
Thames on the first of X :'v:::ber, and con- 
tinue till May. The TL;...; smelts are the 
best and sweetest, for two reasons : they are fresh- 
er, aud richer, than any other you can get : 



FISH. 

Iliey catch ihem much raore plentiful and larger 
in Lancashire and Norfolk, but not so good : a 
great many are brought ta town from Norfolk, 
but barely come good, as they are a tish should 
always be eaten fresh; indeed all river fish should 
be eaten fresh, except salmon, A\hich, unless 
crimpt, eats better tlie gecond or third day : but 
all Ihames fish particularly should be eaten 
very fresli ; no fisli eats so bad kept. 

" Lobsters are, in general, to be procured at all 
times : but the best lime is from .April to August. 
After that time they begin to spawn, and seldom 
open solid. Crabs nearly the same. Prawns are 
best from March to August. Crayfish are gene- 
rally to be procured good at all times ; the sea 
crayfish are xery indifferent fish, and of bad di- 
gestion; the only thing they are good for, is to 
make currie. Lobsters are dressed in many ways 
for dishes ; as lobster sall'd, or Italian sall'd, or 
plain, or currie. 

" Crab picked out of the shell, and divided in 
three parts, and decorated with a little lobster 
spawn, makes a very handsome dish for the se- 
cond course, or a supper dish : some cooks and 
fishmongers dress them verv handsome. 

'' Pipers are a very good fish ; the best that are 
caught are in the mid channel, from off Torbay 
to Plymouth ; they are a very handsome fish 
when first caught, having many beautiful colours, 
but soon fade: they eat"a great deal like a firm, 
fine cod : eat good with a pudding in their bellies, 
baked or roasted, and some good gravy : or plain, 
boiled as you would a haddock. " 

••• Gurnetts. There are many different sorts 
of this fish ; the red gurnett is a good deal like

a piper ; it is dressed the same as a piper or had- 
dock. 

" Eels are a good, and frequently very useful 
fish, as you can generally get them when you can- 
not get other fish, and make a good dish, either 
stewed or spitchcocked. 

" Brawn is sold by fishmongers, and is a good 
thing for side dishes, or the second course : the 
brawn makers generally commence making in No- 
vember, and will continue in season till March." 



BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. 

GENERAL OBSERVATIONS. 



It is hardly necessary to give any more cautions 
to the cook to pay continual attention to the con- 
dition of her stewpans, which should be examin- 
ed every time they are used ; so many mischiefs 
arise from their getting out of repair : if they are 
not kept nicely tinned, all your good work will be 
in vain ; the broths and soups will look green and 
dirty, and taste bitter and poisonous, and will be 
spoiled both for the eye and palate, and your 
credit will be lost ; and as the health, and even 
life of the family depends upon this, the cook may 
be sure her employers had rather pay the tin- 
man's bill than the doctor's ; therefore, attention 
to this cannot fail to engage the regard of the mis- 
tress, between whom and the cook, it will be my 
utmost endeavour throughout this book to pro- 
mote perfect harmony. 

If the servant has the misfortune to scorch or 
blister the tinping of her saucepan, which will

happen sometimes fo the most careful cook, I ad- 
vise her, by all means, immediately to acquaint 
her employers, who will thank her for so candidly 
mentioning the accident ; and only censure her if 
she conceals it. Make it a rule without an excep- 
tion, never to use any sieves or tammy cloths, 
spoons or ladles, till they are well cleaned, and 
thoroughly dried, nor any stewpans &c., without 
first washing them out with boiling water, and 
rubbing them well with a dry cloth and a little 
bran, to clean them from every kind of grease and 
sand, &c. that may have been left in them, or any 
bad smell thpy may have got since they were last 
used : never neglect this. Though we do not 
suppose our cook such a naughty slut, as to think 
of putting by her broth pots, &c., till she has 
thoroughly cleaned * them ; wash them imraedi- 

* Stewpans and soup-pots with round bottoms, such as 
saucepans are made with, will wear twice as long, and are 
cleaned with half the trouble, as those whose sides are sol- 
dered to the bottom ; for the sand and grease, &c. will get 
into the joined part, and it is a difficulty, almost amounting 
to an impossibility, to dislodge the dirt completely. Take 
care also, that the lids fit as close as possible, that the 
broth, soup, &c., that you are making, may not waste by 
evaporation. They are good for nothing, unless they fit 
tight enough to keep the steam in, and the smoke out. 



a(clj, and be sure they are quite dry before tbej 
are put by; and keep them in a dry place, for 
damp will rust and destroy them very soon : at- 
tend to this the first moment you can spare after 
the dinner is sent up ; and never put by any soup, 
gravy, «&c., in a metal utensil ; stone or earthen 
vessels should be used for this purpose. Cultivate 
regular habits of cleanliness, &c., in all your busi- 
ness, -which you -will then get through easily and 
comfortably. I do not mean that restless spirit of 
" the tidy one," who is always frisking about in a 
%vhirlpool of bustle and confusion ; and is always 
dirty, under pretence of being always cleaning. 

Broths differ from soups, as they are inferior in 
strength, and composed with fewer ingredients; 
they are more easy to make, and lead to the art of 
making gravies, soups, and sauces. 

Lean, juicy beef, mutton, or veal, form the basis 
of these : you must procure those pieces which 
afford the most and richest succulence, and as 
fresh killed as possible'^'. Stale meat will make 
your broth thick and bad tasted, and fat meat is 

* In general, it has been considered the best economy to 
use the cheapest and most inferior meats for soup, &c., and 
to boil it down to rags. I think this a false frugality ; and 
advise you to buy good pieces of meat, and only stew them 
till they are done enough to eat.

not only wasted, but occasions the broth very soon 
to turn sour : this only applies to those broths 
which are required to be perfectly clean : we shall 
show hereafter, that fat and drippings may be so 
combined with vegetable mucilage, as to afford, 
at the small cost of lOd. per gallon, a very nourish-

like their made dishes ; in which, though variety 
is aimed at, every thing has the same tastes, and

culinary scribes indiscriminately cram into almost 
every dish, anchovies *, garlickf, bay leaves, 
and that hot, fiery spice, Cajenne pepper. We 
leave those who love these things, to nse them as 
they like ; their flavour can be very extempora- 
neously produced by spirit of Cayenne, garlick 
vinegar, and essence of anchovy if. We again 
caution the cook always to avoid, these predomi- 
nant flavours, which, however agreeable they may- 
be to some, are extremely disagreeable to others. 

Truflles and morels are also set down as a part 
of most receipts. These have a very rich, high 
flavour, and arc delicious additions to some dishes,

* Soy, cavice-coratch, anchovies, curry powder, browning, 
catsup, pickle liquor, beer, and wine, are occasionally very 
convenient auxiliaries to soups, &c. : the proportion of wine 
should not exceed a large wineglassful to a quart of soup, 
though much larger quantities are ordered in many books: 
this is as much as can be admitted, without the vinous flavour 
becoming remarkably predominant. 

f Many a good dish is spoiled, by the cook not knowing 
the proper use of this, which is to give a flavour, and not to 
be predominant to the other ingredients : a morsel mashed 
^vith the point of a knife, and stired in, is enough.

fresh and fine ; but in this state they are not served 
up half a dozen times in a year at the first noble- 
man's table in the kingdom : when they are dried, 
they generally lose their flavour, and serve only 
to soak up good gravy, from which they take 
more taste than they give. The great art of com- 
posing a rich soup is, so to proportion the several 
ingredients one to another, that no particular taste 
be stronger than the rest ; but to produce such a 
fine, harmonious, and delicious relish, that the 
whole is delightful : this requires a very judi- 
cious combination of tlie materials, and constitutes 
the *' chef-d'oeuvre'" of culinary science. 

In the first place, take care that the roots and 
herbs be perfectly well cleaned, and proportion 
the water not only to the quantity of meat *, and 
other ingredients, but to the sort of fire you intend 
to use. If you have a brisk fire, a great deal more 
water must be put in than you intend to have 
broth ; but if it be to stew gently, then little more 
water need be put in at first than is expected at 
the end ; for when the saucepan is covered close, 
and the fire gentle, very little is wasted. In most 
cases, this gentle way of stewing is incomparably

soups; and double that quantity for gravies,

ihc best, and both the meat and the soup eat the 
belter tor it. 

Always dish up your soups the last thing. If 
it be gravv soup, it will skin over if you let it 
stand; if it be peas-soup, it often settles, and the 
top looks thin. 

Bj quick and strong boiling, not only all the 
volatile and finest parts of the ingredients are 
evaporated, and fly off with the steam, but the 
coarser parts are rendered soluble ; so you lose 
the good, and get the bad. The slower they boil 
the better. Soups will generally take from three 
to six hours. 

If possible, always prepare your broths and 
soups the evening before you want them. This will 
give you more time to attend to the rest of your din- 
ner next day ; and when the soup is cold, fat may 
be much more easily and completely removed from 
the surface of it : when you decant it, take care 
not to disturb the settlings at the bottom of the ves- 
sel, which are so fine, they will escape through your 
tammis, or sieve, and are only to be got rid of in 
this manner. The full flavour of the ingredients 
can only be extracted by very long and slow sim- 
mering; during which, take care to prevent the 
evaporation of the steam, by covering your pot 
closely : perhaps the best stew pots are the cast

iron digesters*, made by Jackson and Moser, in 
Greek Street, Soho : in these, all the nutritive qua- 
lities of the meat are preserved, the steam being 
prevented escaping by the lids fitting exactly 
into a screw grove. 

Bread raspings, bread crumbs +, biscuit pow- 
der, isinglass, potatoe mucilage, fat skimmings 
and flour, or flour and butter, or flour and water 
rubbed well together, are the materials commonly 
used J to thicken §, and give a body to our soups. 
To their very rich gravies, &c., the French add 
the breasts of partridges and fowls, beaten to a pulp 
in a marble mortar, a piece of the beef you have 

* The water in the digester is never raade to boil, so there 
is no exhalation of volatile parts; and although the solutioQ 
is made with great success, and may be to any degree requir- 
ed, yet if that is not carried very far, the meat may be ren- 
dered very tender, while it retains its most sapid parts, and 
stHl remain eatable, and useful in the family. 

t To thicken with bread: take the crumb of a French 
roll, boil it in a little of the soup, beat it in a mortar, and rub 
it through a sieve, or coarse cloth, pour this iuto your soup, 
and give it a boil up afterwards.

boiled (o make your broth or gravy, pounded in 
the like manner, with a bit of butter and flour, 
and gradually well incorporated with the gravy or 
soup, will be found an excellent substitute for 
these more expensive articles. Meat from which 
broth has been made, and all the juice has been 
extracted, is then excellently well prepared for 
frothing, and quite as good as that which has 
been baked till it is dry^', and pOunded, &c., 
seasoned in the usual manner, will be an elegant 
and savoury luncheon or supper dish, and ex- 
tremely useful, as we have before observed, to

and you get a delicious relish for sandwiches,&c.,

keeper considered the perquisite of the cat. 

It is a good plan always to keep some spare 
broth, lest your soup liquor waste in boiling, and 
get too thick. If it is too thin, or too weak, take 
off the cover of your soup-pot, and let it boil till 
some of the watery part of it has evaporated, or 
add some of the thickening materials we have be- 
fore mentioned; and always have at hand some

t)etter than any of the compounds bearing that 
iiame^ as it merely colours your sauce or soup, 
without interfering with its flavour. When 
soups and gravies are kept from day to day, 
in hot weather, they sliould be warmed up 
every day, and put into fresh scalded tureens, 
or pans ; in temperate weather, every other 
day may be enough. We hope enough has now 
been said, to put the common cook into possession 
of the whole arcana of soupmaking, without much 
trouble to herself, or expense to her employers ; 
and that it will not be said, in future, that an En- 
glishman only knows how to make soup in his sto- 
mach, by swilling down a large quantity of ale, 
or porter, to quench the thirst occasioned by the 
meat he eats: like the ingenious foreigners he 
may now make his soup in a pot, and thus save 
his principal viscera a great deal of trouble.

tific culinary amateur, Jp ictus CccliiiSjjunr, 

" The great fault of ancient and of modern cook- 
ery has consisted in the employment of the vari- 
ous articles of seasoning or condiment, which, on 
the application of heat, have been evaporated, 
and, from the volatization of their more subtle 
parts, the true flavour of these substances have 
been destroyed. Wine, spices, anchovy, and 
many ingredients, when stewed for a considerable 
time, lose the best part of their flavour."

Wash a shin of beef very clean, crack the bone 
in two or three places, add thereto any trimmings 
you have of meat, game, or poultry, and put 
them into two gallons of cold water, in an open 
pot, on a quick fire ; watch it, and the moment it 
begins to simmer, skim it carefully, or you will 
lose the beauty of your broth, which must be 
perfectly clear and limpid ; on this depends 
the goodness of the soups, sauces, and gravies, of 
"which it is the basis : then add a quart of cold 
water, to make more scum rise, and skim it again, 
and when the scum has quite done rising, put in one 
moderate-sized carrot, a head of celery, two turnips, 
two onions, in one of which stick three cloves, and 
a teaspoonful of salt : cover it close, and set it by 
the side of the fire, and let it boil very gently for 
four or five hours, according to the weight of 
your meat : when it is reduced to about six 
quarts, strain it through a silk or tammis sieve : 
skimt it carefully, and set it in the coldest place 
you have. The quicker it cools the better.

to a boil, put in half a pint of cold water, and 
take off the scum, put in half a pint more cold 
water, skim it again, and continue to do so till no 
more scum rises, then set it on one side of the 
fire, to boil gently for four hours, strain it through 
a clean napkin, or a silk sieve, into a clean China 
or stone pan, let it remain till it is cold, and then 
remove all the grease : when you decant it, be 
careful not to disturb the settlings at the bottom 
of the pan : the liquor should be of a fine 
amber colour, and as clear as rock water : if it is 
not quite so bright as you wish it, put it into a 
stewpiin, and break two whites and shells of eggs 
into a basin, beat them well together, put them 
into the soup, set it on a quick fire, and stir it 
with a whisk till it boils, then set it on one side of

the fire to settle for ten minutes, strain it tlirongh 
a fine napkin into a basin, and it is ready. How- 
ever, if your broth is carefully skimmed, it will be 
clear enough, without clarifying, which im. 
pairs the flavour of the broth much more than it 
improves its appearance. ^ 

Obs. — This is tlie basis of almost all the gravy 
soups, wliicli are called after the various vege- 
tables that are put into them. Carrots, turnips, 
onions, celery, and a few leaves of chervil, make 
wliat is commonly called " soup sante ;" a pint 
of asparagus peas, and a cabbage lettuce, when 
they can be had, are an improvement; with rice, 
or ocotch barley, with Italian paste, or m.accaroni, 
or yermicelli, or celery cut into lengths ; it will 
be the soup usually called by those names, 
or turnips scooped round and fried in butter, or 
young onions prepared in the same way, will give 
you a clear turnip, or onion soup. Whatever 
roots and vegetables you use, must be parboiled 
first, or they will impregnate the soup with too 
strong a flavour. The seasoning for all these 
soups is the same, salt, a little sugar, and a very 
little Cayenne pepper. 

Shin of Beef Soup, (No. 201.) 

Put a large shin of beef (after having sawed 
the bone into several pieces,) into a stewpan, with 
six quarts of water, two teaspoonsful of salt, to 
throw up the scum, which must be carefully and 
completely removed as soon as it appears ; then 
put in three whole onions, three carrots, and a 
couple of turnips, cut iu pieces, a teaspoonful

of whole allspice, and the same of black pepper : 
let it stew very gently for five or six hours, and 
strain it off into a pan, and let it remain till next 
day. When the meat is cold, pick out all the 
gristles and sinews from the meat, cut them into 
pieces as big as a small walnut, and lay them by to 
put into the soup ; the rest of the meat (after the 
skins, &c. arc picked out,) pound in a mortar, 
with a little beaten spice, salt, and a very little 
butter, and make it into potted beef. Next morn- 
ifig take off the fat from the soup, cut three large 
onions iirto slices, and fry them a fine brown (but 
do not let them get burned) in some of the fat you 
have taken off the surface of your soup liquor ; put 
these into a clean stewpan, with your soup, and 
the gristles, and let theni simmer together for half 
an hour, then rub down four tablespoonsful of 
flour in ateacupful of soup, add two tablespoons- 
ful of mushroom catsup, and one of browning ; 
give it a boil up for five minutes, and put it 
through a sieve. It is ready for table. 

Harrico Mutton Soup, (No. 202.) 

Divide a large neck of mutton into two parts, 
put the scrag end into a stewpan, with four large 
turnips, and two carrots, a large onion cut in two, 
and a gallon of water ; let it stew gently over a 
slow fire for two hours, till the mutton is done 
enough, but not till it is boiled to rags : then 
bruise two of the turnips, and one of the carrots 
through a cullender, and put them into the soup, 
to thicken it : cut the other part of the mutton 
into chops, fry them just to brown them, put 
them to the soup, and stew them very gently till

you take it up. Send it up in a soup-tureen or 
dish. 

Mutton Broth, with Cutlets. (No. 203.) 

Cut six or eio^ht handsome cutlcfs off the best

^vith a gallon of water, one Iiead of celery, and a 
small bundle of parsley and thyme ; set it on the 
fire, and when it boils skim it well, and \qX it 
simmer very slowly by the side of the fire for two 
hours ; strain it into a clean stewpan, or broth pot, 
and have ready turnips, carrots, celery, and button 
onions, of each a small teacupful, cut into dice, 
or scooped with a turnip-scoop. Put the cutlets 
and the roots into the broth, season it with salt, 
and let it stew very slowly till they are just tender. 

Scotch Barky Broth, (No. 204.) 

Chop a shin of beef into four or five pieces, put 
it into a soup-pot, with two gallons of cold water, 
and set it over a brisk fire till it boils ; skim it well, 
and put in a large carrot, a turnip, a head of 
celery, and a small bundle of parsley and thyme; 
let it stew gently for three hours, then strain it 
into a clean stewpan, or soup-pot, take off the fat, 
and put in three quarters of a pound of barley, 
well washed and picked, another head of celery, 
two turnips, a carrot, and an onion, cut into small

soft, which will take about two hours more, then 
season it with a teaspoonful of salt. 

Obs. — Instead ofasliin of beef, this is some- 
times made with a neck, or breast of mutton, or a 
couple of sheep's heads, chopped to pieces. 

Scotch Leek Soup. (Xo. '205.) 

Yoii may make tliis soup to most advantaf^e the 
day alterajoirvt of-mutton lias been boiled; put 
tlie liquor the mutton has bren boiled in, into a 
soup-pot, with four large leeks cut into pieces an 
irjcli long, season with pepper and salt, and let it

it up hot. 

Rice Soup. (No. 206.) 

Wash and pick a quarter of a pound of rice, 
put it into a quart stewpan with a pint of cold 
water, put it on the fire, and when it has boiled 
two minutes, put it on a hair sieve to drain ; put 
it into a large stewpan, with three quarts of beef

butter and a pint of water, let them simmer very 
slowly for about an hour, then, add five pints 
of warm water; let it stew on, till the vegetables 
are all well softened, so as they may be rubbed 
through a sieve. Season it with ground black 
pepper and salt. 

Turnip Soup. (No. 208.) 

Make a gallon of clear veal or beef broth ; if it 
is not perfectly clear, it must be clarified*: with 
a turnip-scoop, cut eight or ten turnips that are 
not spongy, into round balls, about as big as a 
nutmeg, do not wash them, but put tlicm into a 
stewpan, with two ounces of butter, and fry them 
of a fine gold colour, dry them on a hair sieve, or 
a sheet of paper, put them into the soup; set it 
by the stove to boil gently for a quarter of an hour, 
skim it carefully, and season it with a little salt 
and sugar ; cut some crusts of bread into bits 
about as big as a nutmeg, dry them on a plate be- 
fore the fire, put some into the soup, and send up 
the rest on a plate. 

Turnip Soup. (No. 209.) 

Peel and wash a dozen large turnips, (taking^ 
care they are not spongy,) cut them into thin 
slices, and put them into a clean gallon stewpan^ 
with three quarts of veal broth, or the liquor that 
mutton, or beef, or veal has been boiled in, (or

onion, and a blade of beaten mace ; cover the 
stew pan close, and set it over a slow fire till the 
vegetables are soft enough to rub through a tam- 
mis, which will be in about half an hour, if the 
turnips are good. While the soup is boiling, cut 
a large turnip into small dice, and boil them till 
they are tender. When your soup is done enough, 
rub it through a tammis into a clean stew pan, sea- 
son it with a teaspoonful of salt, put the turnip 
that you have cut into dice into it ; set it on the 
lire again for ten minutes, and serve it up. Cut a 
slice of bread into dice, and fry it as we have di- 
rected in the receipt for pease soup. No. 218, or 
the crust of a French roll cut into small squares, 
and dried before the fire and sent up on a plate. 

Tta^nip Soup, the French IFai/. (No. 210.) 

In the game season, it is very seldom that phea- 
sants and partridges are all eaten upon a gentleman's 
table, consequently it will be easy for a cook to 
give her master a very good soup at a very little 
expense, by taking all the meat off the breasts, 
and pounding it in a mortar ; and beating to pieces 
the legs and bones, and boiling them in some 
broth for an hour. Boil six turnips, mash them, 
and strain them through a tammis cloth with the 
meat that has been pounded in a mortar, strain 
your broth, and put a little of it at a time 
into the tammis to help you to strain all of it 
through. Put your soup-kettle near the fire, but 
60 not let it boil ; when ready to dish your din- 
ner, have six yolks of eggs mixed with half a pint 
of cream, strain through a silk sieve^ put your

Ohs. — I received the above from the same 
nrtist who wrote the receipt to dress Turtle, 
No. 250. 

Carrot and Turnip Soup. ^ (No. 211.) 

Put three ounces of fresh butter into a three 
quart stewpan ; uiien it i.s melted, till it about one 
third full with carrots and turnips cut into small 
squares; shake these over the tire for ten minutes, 
or a quarter of aaliour; then add as much water 
as will nearly till the saucepan, and after letting it 
stew gently for an hour, slice in a couple of 
onions, stew for two hours longer; a quarter of an 
hour before you serve up, stir in a teacupful of 
I)read raspings, some salt, and either some Cay- 
enne, or common pepper. 

Carrot Soup, (No. 2.1 S.) 

Scrape and wash a dozen large carrots, and 
peel oif the red outsides, which is the only part 
that sliould be used for this soup; put them into 
a gallon stewpan, with one liead of celery, two 
large onions, and two turnips cut into thin pieces, 
the same as the carrots ; take two quarts of com- 
mon beef, veal, or mutton broth, or if you have 
any cold roast beef bones, they will make very 
good broth for this soup; when you have put the 
broth to the roots, cover the stewpan close, and 
set it ou a slow stove for two hours and a half, 



B R O T II S, G Ft A V X ES, A N D S 6 U P S'. 

when (he carrots will be soft enough 16 rub 
til rough a taramis, or hair sieve, with a wooden, 
spoon ; tlien add as much broth as will make it a 
proper thickness, i. e. almost as thick as pease 
soup, put it into a clean stew pan, make it hot, 
season with a little salt, and send it up with some 
toasted bread cut into pieces, half an inch square ; 
some put it into the soup, but the best way is to 
send it up on a plate, as a side dish. 

Obs. — This is a very elegant soup, and neither 
expensive nor troublesome to prepare : inthe kitch- 
en of some opulent epicures, the roots are fried in 
butter, before they are put on to stew : if this is 
not done very carefully, and with very nicely 
clarified fat, all the sweet flavour of the vege- 
tables will be overpowered by the rank cmpyreu- 
matic savour of the fryingpan. 

Parsnip Soup, (No. 21 3.) 

This is made in the same manner as the carrot 
soup; it is unnecessary to recapitulate the lore- 
going receipt. 

Celery Soup. (No. 214.) 

Splithalf a dozen heads of the whitest celery 
you can get into slips about two inches long, 
wash them well, and lay them on a hair sieve to 
drain, and put them into three quarts of veal 
gravy (see Receipt, JNo. 192) in a gallon soup- 
pot ; set it by the side of the fire, to stew very 
gently till the celery is tender ; (this will take 
tibout an hour). If any scum rises, take it off,

Pease Soup, (No. 218.) 

To one quart of split peas (wbole peas are 
often difficult to burst,) put one gallon of soft 
water, and a pound of bacon, (not very fat,) or 
roast beef bones, or four anchovies, or instead 
of the gallon of water, a gallon of the liquor 
in which meat has been boiled, tasting it first, to 
make sure it is not too salt. Wasli two heads of 
celery, cut it, and put it in, with two large onions 
peeled, a sprig of savory, and sweet marjoram; 
set it on the trivet, and let it boil gently over a 
slow tire, stirring it every quarter of an hour (to 
keep the peas from sticking to the bottom,) till 
the peas are tender, which will be in about three 
hours; then work it through a coarse hair sieve, 
and then through a fine one with tlie back of a 
wooden spoon ; put it into a clean stewpan, with 
half a teaspoonful of ground black pepper *, let it 
boil again for icn minutes, and if any fat arises, 
skim it off. You may put in a head of celery cut 
into pieces an inch long, or a score of young 
button onions. Cut a slice of bread, that has 
been baked two or three days, into dice about 
half an inch square; put a tablespoonful of clean 
drippings into an iron fryingpan, and when it is 
melted, put in the bread, and fry it a light brown 
colour; take it up with a fish slice, and lay it on a 
sheet of paper to drain the grease; be careful 
this is done nicely : send these up in one side

Those who arc for a high relish, may have some 
bacon cut into small squares like the bread, and 
fried till it is crisp, and sent up in another little 
dish. 

Obs. — The most economical method of makins^ 
pease soup, is to save the bones of a joint of roast 
beef, and put them into the liquor a leg of mutton 
has been boiUd in, and proceed as in the above 
receipt. A hock, or shank bone of ham, or a ham 
bone, or the root of a tongue, or a red herring, 
are favourite additions with some cooks ; others 
send up rice or vermicelli with pease soup*. 

Pease Soup without Meat, (No. 219.) 

A pease soup may be made savoury, full to 
the palate, and most excellent and agreeable, 
without any meat, by incorporating two ounces 
of fresh beef, mutton, or pork drippings, with two 
ounces of oatmeal, and mixing this w-ell into the 
gallon of soup, made as in the first receipt. 

Fease Soup, ami Pickled Pork, (No. 220.)

than two days, it must be laid in water the night 
before it is used, and put it on in a gallon of 
water, with the ingredients mentioned in the first 
receipt ; let it boil gently for two hours, then put 
in the pork, and boil very gently for an hour 
longer; when done, wash the pork clean in hot 
water, and send it up in a dish, and the soup in a 
tureen, with the accompaniments ordered in the 
first receipt for pease soup. 

Ohs, — The meat is boiled no longer than to be 
done enough to eat; thus you get the soup witb- 
out any expense of meat destroyed. 

Plain Pease Soup, (No. 22 1 .) 

To a quart of split peas, and two heads of ce- 
lery, put a gallon of soft water ; let them simmer 
gently over a slow fire for three hours ; when 
they are well softened, work them through a 
coarse hair sieve, and then tlirough a fine one, 
into a clean stewpan, with two teaspoonsful of 
salt, and half a teaspoonful of ground black pep- 
per. Prepare fried bread and dried mint as in 
the first receipt for pease soup, and send them up 
with it in two side dishes. 

Ohs. — This is an excellent family soup, pro- 
duced with very little trouble or expense ; most of 
the receipts for pease soup, like those preceding^ 
this, are crowded with ingredients that completely 
overpower the flavour of the pea.

Asparagus Soup, (No. 222.) 

This is a soup made with (he heads of aspara- 
gus, in the same manner as the green pease soup 
is with pease, except that only half the asparagus 
is rubbed through a sieve, the other is to be cut 
in pieces about half an inch long, and boiled till 
tender, and sent up in the soup ; to make two 
quarts of good soup, there must be half a pint of 
heads to thicken it, and another half pint cut in. 
This soup is sometimes made, by adding the aspa- 
ragus heads to common pease soup. 



TVater Soup. (No. 223.) 

Clean four carrots, four onions, two parsnips, 
and two heads of celery, three or four turnips, a 
small cabbage, half a pint of split peas, a leek, 
and a teacupful of bread crumbs ; put them inta 
a saucepan with five pints of cold water, place it 
over a slow fire, and let it boil gently for three

a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, a bay leaf, an 
onion, with two cloves stuck in it, and half a pint 
of broth or water ; let it simmer in the corner of

To make your soup, you must have one pound 
of good lean ham, a knuckle of veal, and an old 
fowl ; cut your ham in slices, and lay them at 
the bottom of a large stewpan, cut your veal to 
pieces and your fowl, and put them to the ham, 
with a ladleful of broth, or water ; set your stew- 
pan on tlie fire, and let it reduce till it begins to 
stick to the stewpan, then cover your meat with 
broth, or water, skim it well, put in some salt, 
witli two carrots, one onion, two cloves, a head of 
celery, two turnips, and one parsnip ; let it sim- 
mer four or live hours, then strain the liquor 
through a hair sieve ; three quarts is all you must 
expect, if you like to have good soup ; then have 
three quarters of a pound of parmesan cheese 
grated ; when ready to dish, take away the onion 
and bay leaf from the maccaroni, put at the bottom 
of your tureen, a bed of maccaroni, then a bed of 
parmesan cheese, and so on, till all is in ; pour

Cray Fish Soup, (No. 9.^5^ 

This soup is sometimes made with beef broth, 
and sometimes with fish, in the following manner. 

Take two or three flounders, eels, gudgeons, 
&c. and set them on to boil in a gallon of cold 
water ; when it is pretty nigh upon boiling, scum 
it well, and put in a couple of onions, and as 
many carrots cut to pieces, and some parsley, a 
dozen berries of black and Jamaica pepper, and 
about half a hundred cray-fish ; take off the 
small claws, and shells of the tails, and pound 
Ihem fine, and boil them with your broth about 
an hour ; strain off, and break in some crusts of 
bread to thicken it, and if you can get it, the 
spawn of a lobster, (the inside spawn gives the 
most colour,) pound it and put to your soup, and 
let it simmer very gently for a couple of minutes, 
put in your cray-fish, make hot, and send up.

Praxvn^ or Shrimp Soup, (No. 235.) 

Prawns, or shrimps, make an excellent soup 
done just in the same manner; but there is a 
*mali bag in the carcass full of gravel, which 
must be taken out before you pound them for 
stock. You use only the tails of the prawn, but 
the cray-fish, body and all, except the legs and 
shells. 

Lobster Soup. (No. 9.S7) 

To make a most elegant, nutritious, and de- 
licious lobster soup, take four large live young 
hen lobsters, pick out all the eggs, or outside live 
spawn, then boil the lobsters in salt and water for 
twenty or thirty minutes, according to their size; 
when cold, split the tails, take out the fish, crack 
the claws, and cut the meat into raouthfuls : take 
out the coral and soft part of the body, bruise 
part of the coral in a mortar, pick out the fish 
from the chines, beat part of it with the coral, and 
with this make force-meat balls finely seasoned 
with mace, nutmeg, and a little grated lemon-peel, 
and boil them in a little of your veal broth. Make 
a gallon of veal broth as per receipt No. 191, sea- 
son it with mace, nutmegs, and a little sweet basil ; 
take the live spawn and bruise it in a marble 
mortar with a little of your veal broth, rub it 
through a sieve, and add it to your soup with the 
meat of the lobsters, and the remaining coral ; let

stewpan; when it is melted, throw into it two 
large tablespoonsful of flour ; when they are well 
mixed together, and browned by degrees, pour 
to this your soup, and stir it well together for half 
an hour, strain it through a hair sieve into a clean 
stewpan, and put to it the meat of the head (which, 
while your soup has been going on, you have cut 
into pieces about an inch and a half square) ; let it 
stew half an hour longer, and season it with Cay- 
enne pepper, salt, and a glass of good white wine, 
or a tablespoonful of brandy. 

Ox Tail Soup. (No. 240.) 

Two tails will make a tureen of soup ; cut them

carefully, as long as you see any scum rise ; then 
cover your pot as close as possible, and set it on 
the side of the fire to keep simmering till the meat 
becomes tender ; this will require two or three 
hours ; mind it is not done too much : when per- 
fectly tender, take out the meat, skim the fat off 
your broth, and strain it through a sieve ; to 
thicken it, put four tablespoonsful of the fat you 
have taken off the broth into a clean stewpan,

Hare Soup (No. 241.) 

Is one of the best ways of dressing an old hare, 
which, when it is so tough as to defy the teeth in 
any other form, will make excellent soup. 

Cut off the legs and shoulders, and divide the 
body crossways, stew it very gently in a gallon of 
water, with two ounces of lean ham or bacon, four 
carrots, two onions, with four cloves stuck in 
them, two blades of pounded mace, and a bundle 
of sweet herbs, till the whole is tender : the time 
this will take, depends very much upon the age 
of the hare, and how long it has been kept before 
it is dressed ; as a general rule, say three hours : 
when it is quite tender, take the meat off the back, 
i2 



BROTHS, GRAVIES, AND SOUPS. 

cut it into small pieces, and lay it aside ; cut the 
rest of the meat off the legs and shoulders, mince 
it, pound it in a mortar, and rub it through a 
hair sieve, to make thickening for the soup ; put 
in the meat of the back, season with a little nut- 
meg and salt, a glass of port wine, and a few 
grains of Cayenne pepper. 

Obs. — Cold roast hare will make excellent 
soup. Chop it in pieces, and stew it in three 
quarts of water for about an hour, and manage it 
as in the above receipt ; the stuffing of the hare 
•will be a very agreeable substitute for sweet herbs

a teaspoonful of salt, and a glass of white wine.

Mock Turtle, as niade bij M. Birch, one of 
Apicius's Assistants in this JFork. (No. 5246.) 

Take two pounds of gravy-beef, with a small 
knuckle of veal, about 3lbs ; chop the bone, and cut 
the beef in thin slices ; put it into a gallon stewpan, 
with half a pint of water, a slice of lean ham or ba- 
con, one turnip, one carrot, three onions, jvith four 
cloves stuck in one, a teaspoonful of black pepper, 
the same of allspice, a bundle of sweet herbs ; put 
it over a slow fire till it is of a light brown, but be 
very careful it does not burn ; then put to it two 
quarts of boiling water, let it simmer for two hours, 
then strain it off, and put two quarts more; simmer 
it for three hours longer, strain it off, and set it by 
till next day : boil half a calf's head with the skin 
on, three quarters of an hour; when cold, cut the 
meat off in small square pieces. To thicken your 
soup, put an ounce of butter into a stewpan ; as 
soon as it is melted, mix two tablcspoonsful of 
flour with it, stirring it over the fire a few minutes ; 
then mix the gravy with it by degrees : as soon 
as it boils, mix three tablcspoonsful of oatmeal 
with cold water, and put to the soup ; let it boil 
for ten minutes, strain it, and put it into the stew- 
pan again with the meat, and a roll of lemon-peel ; 
simmer it for an hour and a half, or two hours, 
till quite tender, and finish your soup with sea- 
soning it with wine, catsup, lemon-juice, &c.

fill it up with the liquor in which the calf's head

Turtle Soup. (No. 250.) 

The following recipe for dressing this richest 
and most delicious dish, is the present practice of 
an experienced French cook, a consummate mas- 
ter of the art, in his own words. 

" The best size for taste, is from 60 to 80 pounds; 
this will make 6 or 8 tureens of fine soup. Kill the 
turtle the evening before you wish to dress it ; tie a 
cord to the hind fins of the turtle, and hang it up 
with the head downwards; tie the fore fins by way 
of pinioning them, it would otherwise beat itself, 
and be troublesome to the executioner ; take the 
head with your left hand, and with a sharp knife 
cut oft' the neck as near the head as possible; 
there is a joint where the knife will pop through 
■without any force. Have one or two large tubs 
of water ready, and when you dissect your turtle, 
put it on a block on the back shell, slip your 
knife between the calliopee and the calliopash ; I 
mean between the breast and the edge of the back 
shell : when the knife has been round, and the 
breast is detached from the back shell, pass your 
fingers underneath, and with your knife detach the

oreast from the fins, always keeping the edge of 
vour knife on the side of the breast, otherwise it 
may happen you may break the gall, whicli is 
very large, and if broken, your turtle is spoiled. 
Cut yoiu breast into four pieces, next take away 
the guts, beginning by the liver, and cut away the 
gall, to be out of danger at once. The guts are 
to be thrown away : 1 have seen some cooks have 
them cleaned and cut in pieces, and put into the 
soup, but generally they arc left on the gentle- 
men's plates : a basin of turtle is considered a 
treat, consequently it should be so dressed that 
none be left on the plate or basin- When your 
turtle is emptied, throw the heart, liver, kidneys, 
and lights, into water, cut away the fins to the 
root, I mean as near to the back shell as possible, 
next cut the fins in the second joint, that the 
white meat may be separated from the green : 
scrape the fat that sticks against the back sheD, or 
calliopash, take it like as if you was skimming 
any thing, and put it aside. Cut the calliopash 
into four pieces. Set a large turbot pan on the 
fire, and when it boils dip a fin into it for a 
minute, then take it out and peel it very clean ; 
when that is done, take another, and so on till all 
are done ; then the head, next the shell and breast, 
piece by piece. Be careful to have the peel and 
shell entirely cleaned off, then put in the same 
pan some clean water, with the breast and back, 
the four fins, and the head; let it boil till the 
bones will leave tlie meat ; put with it a large 
faggot of turtle herbs as big as your two fists, four 
bay leaves, and some thyme. If you mean to 
make two dishes of the fins, you must take them 
away when they have been boiled one hour.

Mock Turtle. (Na ^5\.) j 

This receipt is from the same source as the pre- i 
ceding one, and is an excellent and highly finish- j 
ed soup. > 

Have a calfs head scalded with the skin on, cut j 
it in two, take out the brain, and v.' ash your head ; 
well ; when well cleaned, tie it up in a cloth, and ; 
let it boil four hours, then take it out, and let it ; 
cool till you want it. Have a pound of lean ham ; 
cut in slices, range them to the bottom of a stock- i 
pot, or braising kettle ; cut two knuckles of veal \ 
into pieces, put them over your ham, put a I 
ladleful of broth or water in your stock-pot, and ' 
set it over a brisk fire ; when the meat begins to 
stick to the bottom, cover your meat with water ; ; 
when it has been skimmed well, put two carrots, 
two onions, three bay leaves, four cloves, three i 
blades of mace, a large faggot of turtle herbs, and

some salt ; let it boil four hours ; your broth must 
be reduced to six or seven quarts ; strain your 
broth through a tammis sieve, then put in a stew- 
pan three ounces of butter, let it melt, then put 
to it two wooden spoonsful of flour, stir it till it is 
the colour ot a hazel nut, then pour in a bottle of 
Madeira wine, mix it well, then pour in your 
broth, and stir it till it boils, put in three table- 
spoonsful of essence of anchovies, a teaspoonful of 
curry powder, and half a teaspoonful of Cayenne 
pepper : skim it well. 

Now cut your calf's head, take only the skin, 
the ears, the eyes, and the tongue, all about an 
inch long, and half an inch wide ; do not put any 
other meat but what is mentioned, as any other 
part of the head, if put with this, would go to 
pieces, and spoil the look of your soup ; make 
some forcemeat balls, as mentioned in the pre- 
ceding receipt for turtle ; let them simmer ten 
minutes. When ready to dish, squeeze two 
lemons in each tureen; send it up as hot as 
possible. 

Portable Soup, (No. 252.) 

Break the bones of a shin of beef, a small 
knuckle of veal, and a couple of cow heels, put 
them into a soup-pot that will hold four gal- 
lons of water, just cover your meat with water 
and set it on the fire to heat gradually till it nearly 
boils ; watch it, and skim it attentively Avhile any 
scum rises, pour in a quart of cold water, to 
make it throw up all the scum that may remain,

appears clear, put in what herbs or spice you 
please, but no salt; let it boil very gently for 
eight hours, strain it through a hair sieve into a 
large brown stone-pan ; skim off all the grease 
before jou put it by, and set it where it will cool 
quickly ; next day pour it as quietly as possible 
into a thtee gallon stewpan, (taking care not to 
let any of the settlings at the bottom of the stone- 
pan go into the stewpan ; this answers better than 
straining it ;) let it boil as fast as possible, in the 
uncovered stewpan, on a quick fire : pour it into 
a three quart stewpan ; if any scum rises, take it off 
with a skimmer ; now watch it all the time till it 
is reduced to the thickness of a very thick syrup ; 
take the utmost care that it does not burn ; a 
moment's inattention now will lose you all your 
labour, and the soup will be spoiled : take a little 
of it out in a spoon and let it cool ; if it sets into 
strong jelly, it is done enough ; if it does not, 
boil it a little longer, and try it again till it does ; 
have ready some little preserving pots, let them 
be quite dry, pour the soup into them*, and let 
it stand till the next day. Set a large flat bot- 
tommed stewpan, one third part filled with boil- 
ing water, over a very slow fire, place the pots 
of soup in this, taking care (hat the water does 
not reach the rims of them within a couple of 
inches ; let the pots stand (uncovered) in this 
hot water (without boiling) for six or seven hours. 
This is the only way of bringing the soup to a 
proper thickness ; it was before boiled up as high 
as it could be, over the naked fire, without burn- 

* You will get a pint of excellent broth by washing out the 
stewpan with a pint of boiling water.

ing; but that was not enough, without the aid of 
this water-bath it could not be reduced to the 
thickness of a stiflf glue, whilst hot, which 
is the only way to be sure of its being perfectly 
firm when cold. It will now be of the con- 
sistence of a thick hard glue, and will keep 
good for many months, if it is put in a cool dry 
place. 

Obs.' — The uses of this concentrated essence 
of meat are numerous. As a general keeping 
stock, it is the most convenient basis for making 
extempore broths, soups, gravies, and sauces. To 
make a pint of broth, pour a pint of boiling water 
on apiece of the soup, about as big as a small wal- 
nut, stir it till it is melted, add a little salt, and the 
broth is ready : if you have time and opportunity, 
as there is no seasoning in the soup, either of 
herbs or spice, it will be a great improvement to 
boil a bit of parsley and thyme, and half a dozen 
corns of black pepper, in the water you melt the 
soup in : this will produce you as good a broth as 
need be. 

An ounce of soup, melted in a quart of gravy, 
is just the same as the quart of gravy was before it 
was so boiled away. 

To clarify Broth or Gravy. (No. 252.*) 

Put on the broth in a clean stewpan, break the 
white and shell of an egg^ beat them together, 
put them into the broth when it is coming to a 
boil, stir it very quick with a whisk ; when it has 
boiled a few minutes, strain it through a tammis 
or a clean napkin.

for the reason they were admitted into the cookery

I could have made this the bigrgest book* with 
half the trouble it has taken me to make it the 
best, I have taken as much pains in describing, 
in the fullest manner, how to make in the easiest, 
most agreeable, and most economical way, tliose 
common sauces that daily contribute to the com- 
fort of the middle ranks of society ; as I have, in 
directing the preparation of those extravagant 
and elaborate double relishes, the most ingenious 
and accomplished " officers of the mouth'^ have

qualities ; and yet so ordering them, that Ibey ma, 
delight the palate, without disordering the sto

ents which are only fit for an " iron throat, an(

which any rational being would refuse to destroy

voting so much time to the business of th( 
kitchen, and repeating every . experiment tha

gratified, if my book is not bought up with quit( 
80 much avidity by those high bred epicures 
who are unhappily so much more nice than wise, 
they cannot eat any thing dressed by an English-

ia the vulgar tongue*. Let your sauces each 
display a decided character ; send up your sim- 
ple sauces as pure as possible ; they should only 
taste of the material they take their name from. 
. The imagination of most cooks is so incessantly 
on the hunt for a relish, they seem to think 
they can never make sauce savoury, without put- 
tmg into it every thing that ever was eaten ; and loo 
fond of supposing every addition must be an im- 
provement, frequently destroy the natural flavour 
of their plain sauces, by overloading them with 
salt and spices f : but, remember, these will be de- 
teriorated by any addition, save only just salt 

* Though some of these people have at last found out, 
that an Englishman's head is as full of gravy as a French- 
man's, and willing to give the preference to native talent, 
retain an Englishman or woman as prime minister of their 
kitchen ; still they seem ashamed to confess it, as they com- 
monly insist, as a " sine qua non," that these English domes- 
tics should understand the " parlez voics ;" and notwithstand- 
ing they are perfectly initiated in all the minutias of culinary 
concerns, they consider ihem ineligible, if they cannot scrib- 
ble a bill of fare in French. 

t Spices are often very injudiciously jumbled together. 
We would never have clove and allspice, or mace and nut- 
meg in the same sauce : one will very well supply the place 
of the other, and the frugal cook may save something con- 
siderable by attending to this, to the advantage of her em-

enough to awaken the palate. On the contrary, 
of your compound sauces the ingredients should 
be so nicely proportioned, that no one be predo- 
minant ; but, from the equal union of the com- ' 
bined flavours, a fine mellow mixture is pro- 
duced, whose very novelty cannot fail of being \ 
sufficient excitement to the persevering gourmand, ; 
if it has not pretensions to a permanent place at ' 
his table. An ingenious cook will form an end- ; 
less variety of these compositions ; and no part of i 
her business offers so fair an opportunity for her j 
to display her abilities. i 

To be a complete mistress of the art of cleverly \ 
extracting and combining flavours *, besides the i 
gift of a good taste, requires all the experience, all ; 
the genius, and all the dexterity and skill of the 
most accomplished and exquisite professor, and i 
an intimate acquaintance and an attentive eonsi- ; 
deration of the palates of those she is working for. ; 

Take especial care to have your sauces sent to 
table as hot as possible : nothing need be more ' 

ployers, and her own time and trouble. In many of our re- '■ 
ceipts, we have fallen in with the fashion of ordering a mixture I 
of spices, which the above hint will enable the culinary stu- i 
dentto correct.

unsightly, than the surface of a sauce in a frozen 
state, or garnished with grease on the top ; to re- 
move every particle of which, draw a piece of 
filtering paper over it : the same may be said of 
all made dishes, of whose paraphernalia the sauce 
forms a conspicuous part : remember to let your 
sauces boil up, after you have put in any wine, 
anchovy, or thickening, that their flavours may 
be well blended with the other ingredients*. 

* Before you put eggs or cream into a sauce, have all your 
other ingredients well boiled, and your sauce or soup of pro- 
per thickness, as neither eggs nor cream will contribute much 
to thicken it. After you have put them in, do not set the 
stewpan on the stove again, but hold it over the fire, and 
shake it round one way till the sauce is ready.

Melted Butter j 

Appears to be so simple and easy to prepare, it ■ 
is certainly very surprising it is not uniformly 
Tvell done, and is a matter of general astonishment, < 
that what is done so often in every kitchen, ' 
should so seldom be done right. 

it is spoiled nine times out often, more from ! 

idleness than from ignorance, and rather because 

the cook wont do it, than because she can't do it. ; 

As it is the foundation of almost all our sauces*, ; 

I have tried every way of making it, and hope, i 

at last, 1 have written two receipts, which if the i 

reader carefully observes, she will constantly \ 

succeed in giving satisfaction. In the quantities \ 

of the various sauces I have ordered, I have had j 

in view the providing for a moderate family of ; 

half a dozen people. I recommend the cook ; 

never to pour the sauce over the meat, or even j 

put it into the dish ; for, however well made, some ' 

of the company may have an antipathy to it : : 

moreover, if it is sent up separate in a boat, it \ 

will keep hot longer, and what is left of it may be I 

put by for another time, or used for another pur- I 

pose. \ 

Lastly, it is to be observed, that in ordering the ; 

proportions of meat, butter, wine, spice, «&c. in the j 

following receipts, the proper quantity is set down, ' 

and that a less quantity will not do; and in some: 

instances, those who are fond of the extreme of; 

piquance perhaps will require an addition. 

if we have erred, it has been on the right side,^ 

from an anxious wish to combine elegance with!

Melted Butter. (No. 255.) i 

Keep a pint stewpan for this purpose only. 

Cut two ounces of butter into little bits, that it ; 
may melt more easily, and mix more readily ; ; 
put it into the stewpan with a teaspoonful of flour, I 
and a tablespoonful of milk. When these are ; 
well mixed, add three tablespoonsful of water ; \ 
hold it over the fire, and shake it, (all the while ; 
the same way,) till it just boils up. It should be | 
of the thickness of good cream. i 

Obs. — This, we think, is incomparably the < 
best way of preparing melted butter. The milk i 
mixes with the butter much more easily, and more \ 
intimately than water alone can be made to do, ; 
and it looks smooth and fine like cream. If it is j 
to be mixed at table with savoury essences, i 
catsup, or cavice, &c., it should be made thicker 
than if made merely to pour over vegetables. 

1 
Thickening, (No. 9.57) \ 

Clarified butter is best for this purpose ; but if \ 

you have none ready, put some fresh butter into j 

a stewpan over a slow clear fire ; when it is melted, i 

add fine flour sufficient to make it the thickness of | 

paste ; stir it well together with a wooden spoon j 

for twenty minutes, till it is quite smooth, and | 
the colour of a guinea : pour it into an earthen 

pan, and keep it for use. It will keep good a i 

fortnight in summer, and a month in winter. The i 

bigness of a walnut will generally be enough to I 
thicken a quart of gravy. 

Obs* — This in the French kitchen is called j 

roux. Be particularly attentive to the making of ; 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

it ; if it gels any burnt smell or taste, it will spoil 
every thing it is put into. When cold, it should 
be thick enough to cut out with a knife, like a solid 
paste. It is a very essential article in the kitchen, 
and is the basis of consistency in most made 
dishes, soups, sauces, and ragouts : if the gra- 
vies, &c. are too thin, add this thickening, more 
or less, according to the consistence you would 
wish them to have. In making thickening, the 
less butter, and the more flour you use, the better ; 
they should be thoroughly worked together, and 
the broth, or soup, &c. you put them to, added 
by degrees, and take especial care to incorporate 
them well together, or your sauces, &c. will have 
a disgusting, greasy appearance ; therefore, after 
you have thickened your sauce, add to it some 
broth, or warm water, in the proportion of two 
tablespoonsful to a pint, and set it by the side of 
the fire, to raise any fat, &c. that is not tho- 
roughly incorporated with the gravy, which you 
must carefully remove as it comes to the top. 
This is called cleansing, or finishing the sauce. 

%* Half an ounce of butter, and a tahlespoonful of flour , are 
abo7it the proportions for a pint of sauce , to make it as 
thick as good cream. 

Savour]/ Thickenmg, (No. 258.) 

Put a quarter of a pound of butter into a stew- 
pan with the meat of half a dozen anchovies, 
three eshallots, and four large blades of pounded 
raacc ; stir together, and by degrees add as much 
flour as will make it a stiff* paste ; put it into a pot, 
for the purpose of heightening the flavour of your 
brown sauces.

SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

Oh<^. — The cook will vary the spices, &c. 
according to the taste of those she works for. 

Clarifed Butter. (No. 259.) 

Put the butter in a nice clean stewpan, over a 
very clear slow fire, watch it, and when it is 
melted, carefully remove the buttermilk, «&c. 
which will swim on the top ; let it stand a minute 
or two for the impurities to sink to the bottom, 
and then lay a tammis in a sieve, and pour the 
clear butter through it, into a clean basin, leaving 
the sediment at the bottom of the stewpan. 

Ohs. — Butter thus purified, will be as sweet 
as any marrow, and is a very useful covering for 
all potted meats and fish, and equal to the finest 
Lucca oil for frying fish, and many other culinary 
purposes. 

Burnt Butter. (No. 260.) 

Put two ounces of fresh butter into a small fry- 
ingpan, and when it becomes a dark brown 
colour, add to it a tablespoonful and a half of 
good vinegar, and a little pepper and salt. 

Obs. — This is used as sauce for boiled fish, or 
poached eggs. 

Parsley and Butter, (No. 26 1 .) 

Wash some parsley very clean, put a tea- 
spoonful of salt into a pint of boiling water, and 
boil the parsley two or three minutes, drain it on 
a sieve, and mince it quite fine. The delicacy 
and excellence of this sauce depends upon the 
pursley being minced very xcrt/ tine ; put it into

a sauce boat, and mix with it by degrees about 
balf a pint of good melted butter. 

Ohs. — Be careful (o pick the parsley oiF the 
stalks before you boil it. 

Mock Parsley Sauce. (No. 262.) 

If you cannot get any parsley, you may easily 
communicate the exact flavour of it to your 
sauce, by tying up a quarter of adraclim of parsley 
seed in a piece of clean muslin, and boiling it for feu 
minutes in five tablespoonsful of water; use this 
water to melt your butter with. 

Gooseberry Sauce, (No. 9,63.) 

Boil half a pint of green gooseberries for five 
minutes, drain them on a hair sieve, and put them 
into half a pint of melted butter. Some add 
grated ginger. 

Chervil and Butter. (No. 264.) 

This is the first time this very delicious herb, 
which has so long been a favourite with the saga- 
cious French cook, has been introduced into 
an English book. Its flavour is a strong con- 
centration of the combined taste of parsley and 
fennel, but inimitably more aromatic and agree- 
able than either. I cannot account for its being 
so little known in the English kitchen. You may 
make most exquisite sauce with it by preparing 
it, &c. as we have directed for parsley and 
butter. You may enrich it with the juice of iialf 
a lemon, and a tablespoonful of white wine.

^' It is a salubrious culinary herb, sufficiently 
nutritive to the palate and stomach." 

Fennel and Butter, for Mackarel, 8§c, 
(No. 265.) 

Is prepared in the same manner as we have just 
described the parsley and butter. 

Obs. — For mackarel sauce, some people take 
equal parts of fennel and parsley. 

Mackarel Roe Sauce, (No. 0.66.) 

Boil the roes of mackarel, (soft roes are best,) 
bruise them with a spoon with the yolk of an Qgg, 
beat up with a very little nutmeg, pepper, and salt, 
and some fennel and parsley boiled and chopped 
very fine, mixed with almost half a pint of thin 
melted butter. 

Mushroom catsup, walnut pickle, or soy, may 
be added at table by those who like them. 

Egg Sauce. (No. 9,67) 

This agreeable accompaniment to roast poultry, 
or salt fish, is made by putting two eggs into boil* 
ing water, and boiling them for eight minutes, 
when they will be hard ; first cut tlie whites, then 
the yolks, but neither very fine, put them into a

sauce-boat, pour to them half a pint of raeKed but- 
ter, and stir together. 

Obs. — The melted butter for egg sauce must 
7iot be made quite so thick as plain melted 
butter. 

Pudding Sauce, (No. 268.) 

Bruise a stick of cinnamon, (cassia will not do,) 
set it over the fire in a saucepan, with just as much 
water as will cover it, give it a boil, and then put 
in a couple of tablespoonsful of fine lump sugar, 
powdered, a quarter of a pint of white wine, and 
one bay leaf; boil all up together; strain it 
through a sieve, and send it up hot in a sauce- 
boat. 

Plumb Pudd'mg Sauce. (No. 269.) 

A glass of sherry, half a glass of brandy, and 
two teaspoonsful of pounded lump sugar, in a 
quarter of a pint of melted butter : grate nutmeg 
on the top. 

Ancho'cy Sauce, (No. 270.) 

Take oflf the meat of two or three anchovies, 
pound them in a mortar with a little bit of butter, 
rub them through a double hair sieve, with the back 
of a wooden spoon, and stir them into half a pint 
of melted butter ; add the juice of half a lemon. 

%* Two well beaten yolks of eggs are an improvement. 

Anchovy Sauce for Roast Meat. (No. 271.) 
Foreigners are very fond of this, and make it as 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

in the foregoing receipt, only substituting beef or 
veal gravy instead of melted butter, and a tea- 
spoonful of vinegar instead of the lemon juice, 
frequently using some of their flavoured vinegars^ 
tarragon, &c. 

Gar lick Sauce, (No. 1272.) 

Pound two cloves of garlick in a marble mortar, 
with a piece of fresh butter about as big as a nut- 
meg ; rub it through a double hair sieve, and stir 
it into half a pint of melted butter, or beef gravy. 

Lemon Sauce. (No. Q.7S.) 

Pare a lemon, and cut it into slices twice as 
thick as a three shilling piece ; divide these into 
dice, and put them into a quarter of a pint of 
melted butter. 

Cape?' Sauce. (No. 274.) 

A tablcspoonful of capers, and twoteaspoonsfulof 
vinegar ; mince one third of the capers very fine, 
and clividc the others in half; put them into a quar- 
ter of a pint of melted butter. Remember to stir 
them the same way as you did the melted butter, 
or it will oil. 

Obs. — Some boil and chop a few leaves of 
pnrsley, and add these to the sauce; others 
squeeze in a quarter of a Seville orange, or half 
a lemon ; take care that nothing but the clear juice 
goes in. 

Keep your caper bottle very closely corked; and 



SAUCES AXD GRAVIES. 

do not use any of the caper liquor; if llie capers 
are not well covered with it, they will soon spoil, 
and it is an excellent ingredient in hashes, &c. 
The Dutch use it as a fish sauce, mixing it with 
melted butter. 

Mock Caper Sauce, (No. 275.) 

Gut some pickled gherkins into small bits, 
rather less than capers ; put them into half a pint 
of melted butter, with two teaspoonsful of lemon 
juice, or nice vinegar, and flavour it with a few 
drops of essence of shallots or garlick. 

Dutch Sour Sauce, for Fish. (No. 276.) 

Beat up the yolks of two eggs, and put them 
into a stewpan with two ounces of butter, two 
blades of mace, and a tablespoonful of elder vine- 
gar, or the same quantUy of lemon juice; melt over 
a gentle fire, stirring the ingredients together all 
the while the same way, and strain it through 
a tammis cloth. 

Cream Sauce, for Fish. (No. 277.) 

Put the meat of two anchovies pounded with a 
bit of butter, and rubbed through a sieve, a tea- 
spoonful of soy, and two teaspoonsful of mush- 
room catsup, into half a pint of good cream, add 
a bit of butter as big as a nutmeg, rolled in flour 
to thicken it, and give it a boil up. 

Qls. — This is a very delicate and delicious 
white sauce, and wiiere o;ood cream can be easily 
procured; much preferable to the butter sauces.

Oyster Sauce. (No. 278.) 

Choose small natives for this purpose; don't 
open them till you want them. 

Save their liquor, shave them, and put them 
into a stewpan over ihe fire with the beards and 
liquor ; as soon as they begin to look plump and 
white, take them out one at a time with a fork, 
then put to the liquor a spoonful of veal gravy or 
milk ; some add six berries of black pepper, a 
piece of lemon peel, a blade of mace, and a table- 
spoonful of sherry : let this simmer for ten minutes, 
then strain it through a fine sieve, let it stand till 
cold, then put two ounces of butter into a stew- 
pan with a teaspoonful of fine flour, mix your 
liquor by degrees with it, put milk or cream, to 
make the quantity you wish, give it a boil up, 
and put in your oysters ; set them by the side of 
the fire to keep hot, but take care they do not boil, 
or they will become hard. 

Pickled Oyster Sauce, (No. 9^79,) 

Open a Iiundred fine large oysters into a pan 
with all their liquor with them ; wash them clean 
with their liquor, one by one ; put the liquor into 
a stewpan, give it a boil, then strain it through a 
sieve, and let it stand half an hour to settle ; pour 
it from the settlings into a stewpan, and put in 
half a pint of white wine, the like quantity of 
vinegar, a teaspoonful of salt, half an ounce of 
cloves and mace, and a quarter of an ounce of 
allspice and black pepper bruised; boil up for 
five minutes ; then put in your oysters, and giwe

them a boil up for a minute, put them into small 
jars, and tie them down as close as possible with 
a wet bladder and leather ; keep them in a cool 
dry place. 

When you want oyster sauce, put some of the 
oysters, with a spoonful of the pickle, into good 
melted butter. 

Bottled Oyster Sauce. (No. 280.) 

To make half a pint of sauce, put two ounces 
of butter into a stewpan, with tliree drachms of 
oysters, two drachms of flour, and half a pint of 
new milk ; set it on a slow fire, stir it till it boils, 
and season it with salt. 

Milton oysters, prepared by a peculiar pro- 
cess, which preserves the flavour of the fish in as 
delicate perfection as when just opened. If closely 
corked, and kept in a diy place, they will remain 
good for years. 

Made by E. Stevenson, Cook to Sir Simon 
Clark, Bart., near East Barnet, Middlesex ; 
and sold by the Publisher of this Work, 
and by Messrs. Balls, 81, New Bond Street. 

Ohs, — This is a most incomparable succedaneum 
"while oysters are out of season, and in such inland 
parts as seldom have any, is an invaluable addition 
to the list of fish sauces : it is also equally good 
with boiled fowl or rump steak. It is especially 
worthy the notice of country housekeepers. 

Cockle Sauce. (No. 281.) 

Wash a quart of cockles very clean, put them 
into a saucepan without any water, cover them 
close, and stew gently till they open ; take the 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

fish out of the shells, wash thera in the liquor, 
strain it, let it stand to settle, and pour the clean 
liquor from the settlings into a clean stewpan with 
two ounces of butter, mixed with a tablespoonful 
of flour; you may put in half a tablespoonful of 
anchovy liquor, or mushroom catsup, and season 
it with salt, boil up together till your sauce is 
thick and smooth. 

Muscle Sauce (No. 282.) 

Is prepared exactly in the same manner as the 
preceding cockle sauce. 

Shrimp Sauce. (No. 283.) 

Shell a quarter pint of shrimps, pick them 
clean, wash them, and put them into half a pint 
of good melted butter. 

Obs. — Some stew the heads and shells of the 
shrimps, with or without two blades of bruised 
mace, for a quarter of an hour in four tablcspoons- 
ful of water, and strain off the liquor to melt the 
butter with, or add two teaspoonsful of essence of 
anchovy to it. 

Lobster Sauce. (No. 284.) 

Choose a good hen lobster, be sure it is fresli-, 
so get a live one if you can, and boil it as in ISo. 
176, pick out the spawn into a mortar, add to it 
a quarter of an ounce of butter*, pound it fine, 

* Two or three anchovies are sometimes pounded r.ith the 
spawn. 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

and rub it through a hair sieve with the back of a 
wooden spoon ; cut the meat of the lobster into 
s'.nall squares, or pull it to pieces with a fork : 
break the chine in pieces, and put it into a stew- 
pfin with the inside of the fish and a pint of water; 
let it simmer till it is reduced to about half, (this 
will take near an hour,) strain it through a sieve 
into another stewpan ; when it is cold, add to it 
the spawn jou have bruised, an ounce of butter, 
and two teaspoonsful of flour; mix it well together 
till it boils, tljen put to it the meat of the lobster; 
warm it on the fire again, but do not let it boil, or 
you will lose the red colour. Some who are fond 
of making this sauce very rich, use strong beef 
gravy instead of melted butter, adding catsup, 
cavice, lemon pickle, or wine to it. 

Ohs. — Save a little of the inside red coral 
spawn, and rub it through a sieve (without but- 
ter), it is very ornamental to garnish your fish 
with, by sprinkling it over it ; and if the skin of 
the breast of your fish is broken, it will be useful 
to hide that blemish, which will sometimes hap- 
pen to the most careful cook, when there is. a 
large dinner to gQi up, and many other things to 
attend to. 

Sauce for Lobster, S^c, (No. 285.) 

Bruise the yolks of two hard boiled eggs with 
the back of a wooden spoon, add a teaspoonful of 
water to them, and rub them quite smooth, mix 
them with a teaspoonful of made mustard, two 
tablespoonsful of salad oil, and five of vinegar, 
and season it with a very little Cayenne pepper 
and some salt. 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES, 

Obs, — To this, elder vinegar, catsup, or 
cavice, or ancbovj paste, is occasionally added. 

Crab Sauce. (No. 286.) 

This is prepared in the same way as the former 
sauce, but is very seldom sent to table in this 
country, lobster sauce being almost universally 
preferred, and will be, until John Bull is so raving 
mad for variety as to fancy every change must be 
charming. 

Liver and Parsley Sauce. (No. 287.) 

Wash the liver of a fowl or rabbit, and boil it 
five minutes in five tablespoonsful of water ; chop 
it fine, and bruise it in a small quantity of the 
liquor it has boiled in, and with a spoon rub it 
through a sieve ; wash about one-third the bulk of 
parsley leaves, put them on to boil in a little boil- 
ing water, with a teaspoonful of salt in it ; lay it 
on a hair sieve to drain, and mince it very fine ; 
mix it with the liver, and put it into a quarter 
pint of melted butter, and warm it up : do not let 
it boil. 

Ohs, — You may add the juice of half a lemon, 
or a teaspoonful of vinegar, a tablespoonful of 
white wine, and a little beaten mace or nutmeg, 
or allspice. 

Lemon and Liver Sauce. (No. 288.) 

Pare off the rind of a lemon ; or, what is prefer- 
able when it can be had, the peel of a Seville 
orange, as thin as possible, so as not to cut any of 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

the white with it ; then cut off all the white, and 
cut the lemon into slices about as thick as two 
three shilling pieces ; pick out tiie peps, and di- 
vide the slices into small dice ; boil the liver of a 
fowl or rabbit, pound it, and rub it through a sieve 
"with a spoon, and mix it, by degrees, with three or 
four tablespoonsful of melted butter ; put in the 
lemon, a little of the lemon peel minced very fine, 
and give them a boil up. 

Obs. — This is sometimes made more relishing 
by pounding half a shallot, and two or three leaves 
of tarragon or basil with the liver, and moistening 
it with a little red wine. 

Celeri/ Sauce, White. (No. 289.) 

Pick and wash four heads of nice white cellery ; 
cut it into pieces about an inch long ; put it in a 
saucepan with a pint of water, a dozen berries of 
allspice, a bay leaf, and half a teaspoonful of salt : 
let them stew till the celery is tender *; roll an ounce 
of butter with a tablespoonful of flour ; add this 
to the sauce, and stir it till it boils. 

Celery Sauce^ Broxvn. (No. 290.) 

Pick and wash the celery very clean, and cut 
it into very thin slices ; let it boil gently in a lit- 
tle water till it is perfectly tender, then add a 
couple of blades of pounded mace, the same quan- 
tity of nutmeg, and a little pepper and salt ; let 

* So much depends upon the age of the celery, we cannot 
give any precise time for this. Young celery will be enough 
ill three-quarters of an hour; old celery will sometimes tak6 
an hour and a half. 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

Ibese simmer together for a few minutes, arid add 
a piece of butter rolled in flour, and two table- 
spoonsful of port wine ; boil up together, and put 
in a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, and half 
a pint of beef gravy. 

Ohs. — This is much more in the French style 
of cookery than the former sauce; some think it 
more agreeable. The other is simple and elegant ; 
this is very fine and high flavoured. 

If you wish for celery sauce when no celery is 
to be procured, a quarter of a drachm of celery- 
seed will impregnate the sauce with all the flavour 
of the veijetable. 



Sorrel Sauce, (No. 291.) 

Pound sorrel leaves sufficient to get from them 
two tablespoonsful of juice ; pass it through a 
sieve, and add it to some good melted butter, with 
the yolk of two eggs, and a little salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg ; warm it together without boiling. 

Tomata, or Lore-apple Sauce, (No. 292.) 

Have 12 or 15 tomatas very ripe and very red ; 
take off the stalk ; cut them in half; squeeze them 
just enough to gci all the water and seeds out; put 
them in a quart stewpan, with two or three 
tablespoonsful of beef gravy ; set them on a 
slow stove for an hour, or till properly melted ; 
then rub them through a tammis into a clean stew- 
pan with a little white pepper and salt, and let 
them simmer together a few minutes. 

To preserve tomatas. — Choose them quite ripe ; 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

put them into an earthen jar, and bake them till 
they are tender, which will take about two hours; 
pulp them through a hair sieve, and to each pound 
add a quarter ounce of ground white pepper, the 
same of mace, an ounce of minced shallots, half an 
ounce of garlic, and an ounce of glaze, or portable 
soup ; boil the whole together till every ingredient 
is tender ; rub it through a hair sieve, and to each 
pound add the juice of three lemons ; boil the 
whole together again till it is the thickness of 
good cream ; put it into half-pint preserving pots 
or bottles ; take care they are closely corked ; 
when once opened, the air soon spoils it : it should 
be kept in a cool dry place. 

Mock Tomata Sauce, (No. 293.) 

Take any quantity of sharp tasted apples, and 
reduce them into a pulp as in making apple sauce ; 
put them into a mortar with as much turmeric as 
will give them the colour of tomatas, and as much 
chili vinegar as will give it the same degree of acid 
flavour that the tomata has ; add to each quart 
a quarter of an ounce of garlic, and half an ounce of 
shallots, shred fine ; put all into a well-tinned 
saucepan, and mix them well together, and give 
them a gentle boil ; when cold, take out the garlic 
and shallot, and put the sauce into small stone bot- 
tles : your sauce should be of the consistence of a 
thick syrup, which may be regulated by the chili 
vinegar. 

Ohs. — The only difference between this and 
the genuine love-apple sauce, is the substituting 
the pulp of apple for the pulp of tomata, and giv- 
ing the colouring with turmeric.

Shallot Sauce, (No. 294.) 

Mince four shallots very fine; put them into a; 
stewpan with a quarter pint of water, two table- 1 
spoonsful of vinet^ar, and one of white wine, one '\ 
quarter teaspoonful of pepper, and a little salt : \ 
stew for a quarter of an hour. i 

Or, I 

You may make this sauce more extemporane- 1 
ously, by putting two teaspoonsful of shallot vine- ; 
gar, a tablespoonful of white wine, and a table- j 
spoonful of mushroom catsup, into halfapintofj 
melted butter. 

Ohs, — This is an excellent sauce with rump- j 
tsteaks, and many are very fond of it with roasted . 
fowls, chickens, or capons. 

Shallot Sauce, for Boiled Mutton, (No. 9*95,) \ 

Cut four shallots very fine, and put them into a j 
small saucepan with two tablespoonsful of the li- j 
quor the mutton has boiled in ; let them boil up : 
for five minutes ; then put a tablespoonful of vine- \ 
gar, one-quarter teaspoonful of pepper, and a little j 
salt, and a bit of butter, as big as a small walnut, ; 
well rolled in flour; shake all together; give it a 
boil up. 

Young Onion Sauce, (No. 296.) \ 

Clean and peel some young onions, cut them in- : 
to thin slices, and put them into a stewpan with a i 

4 : 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

slice of bacon, one-quar(er teaspoonful of pepper, 
and one-half teaspoonful of salt ; set them over 
the fire ; when they be^in to heat, moisten them 
with four tablespoonsful of water ; let them stew 
for ten minutes ; take out the bacon, squeeze? in 
half a lemon, and send it up hot. 

Onion Sauce. (No. 297.) 

Those who like the full flavour of onions, only 
cut off the strings and tops, without peeling off any 
of the skins ; put them into salt and water, and let 
them lie an hour ; wash them, and put them into 
a kettle with plenty of water, and boil them till 
they are tender ; then take off as many skins as 
you please ; pass them through a cullender, and 
mix a little melted butter with them. 

Onion Sauce. (No. 298.) 

The following is a more delicate preparation : — 
Take eight of the largest and whitest onions, (the 
Spanish are the whitest and mildest, but these can 
only be had from August to December,) peel 
them, and cut them into thin slices, and boil them 
in a pint of milk, and three pints of water ; when 
they are boiled tender, which will sometimes take 
an hour (the quicker they are boiled, the whiter 
they will be), drain them well on a hair sieve, and 
pass them through a cullender with a wooden 
spoon ; put them into a clean saucepan, with an 
ounce of butter, a teaspoonful of flour, half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and two tablespoonsful of cream, 
or good milk ; mix well, and simmer five minutes. 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

OhS' — This is the common sauce for boiled i 
rabbits or ducks : they are laid dry in the dish, | 
and this sauce is poured over them. There must j 
be plenty of it ; the usual expression signifies as ! 
luuch, for we say, smother them. j 

Fried Onion Sauce. (No. C99.) 

Slice a couple of larc^e onions, and fry them in \ 
butter, turning them often, till they take a good; 
brown colour ; then pour in a teacupful of broth 
or water, with a tablespoonfnl of mushroom catsup, \ 
and same of table-beer, a few pepper-corns, a little 
salt, and a tablespoonfnl of flour; cover the sauce- ^ 
pan close, and let it simmer half an hour, till it is 
reduced to the thickness you wish; press it; 
through a hair sieve, and put a teaspoonful of | 
made mustard to it, and stir well together. i 

Obs. — Haifa pint of young, on ions, about as big \ 
as nutmegs, peeled and put in whole, and fried with | 
them^, will be an elegant addition to the above. i 

Sage and Onion Sauce, (No. 300.) ; 

Cut a large onion into small dice, mince an: 
ounce of sage leaves very fine; put them into ai 
stewpan with half an ounce of butter ; fry them a ■ 
little, but do not let them get any colour ; make ; 
half a pint of thin melted butter, and mix it with, 
the sage and onions; then put a teacupful of bread ■ 
crumbs to the melted butter and herbs; season .

Portugal Onio7i Sauce. (No. 301.) 

Roast a couple of fine large onions in a cliecse- 
toaster or Dutch oven till (hey arc somewhat more 
than half done ; peel them, and take off the first 
coat ; put them into a stewpan, with half a pint of 
good broth (or that quantity of water, with a 
tablespoonful of mushroom catsup), and a table- 
spoojjful of flour; season it with salt and a few 
grains of Cayenne pepper, a glass of port wine, 
and the juice of half a lemon ; let all simmer to* 
gether till tender enough ; rub them through a 
cullender, and mix a little bit of butter with them, 
and you will have a most admirable sauce. 

Carrier' Sauce. (No. 302.) 

j\'ly ingenious predecessor, Dr. King, in his let- 
ter io Dr. Lister {tide *' King's Art of Cookery^'') 
says : '' The following is the true receipt for mak- 
ing ' The Carrier Sauce,' which 1 have from an 
ancient manuscript, remaining at the Bull Inn, in 
BishopsgateStreet :-Take seven spoonsful of spring 
water, slice two onions, of moderate size, into a 
large saucer, and put in as much salt as you can 
hold at thrice betwixt your forefinger and thumb, 
if large, and serve it up. Prohatum est, Hobson, 
carrier to the University of Cambridge."

moist sugar, and four tablespoonsful of vinegar; '■ 
mix well together. 

0^5. — This is an inseparable companion to! 
hot lamb; we wish to see it also as constantly! 
coming to table with cold lamb. If green mint' 
cannot be procured, this sauce may be made with; 
mint vinegar. See No, 398. 

Jpple Sauce, (No. 304.) 

Pare, core, and slice three good sized baking) 
apples, put them into a pint saucepan, (cover it 
close, because the steam helps to do tliem,) with 
one clove, a bit of cinnamon about as big as ai 
clove, a roll of lemon-peel carefully pared thin,i 
without any of the white, one tablespoonful of cold' 
water, and a teaspoonful of moist sugar ; set the; 
saucepan near (but not on) a slow fire ; be sure ta 
put them on a couple of hours before dinner, for 
some apples will take an hour's stewing, and others 
will be ready to press in a quarter of an hour :; 
when the apples are done enough, take out th^ 
spice and lemon-peel, and mash the apples witU 
a wooden spoon. 



Mushroom Sauce. (No. 305.) 

Pick a pint of mushrooms (the smaller the bet- 
ter) very clean, wash them, and put them into a 
saucepan with one blade of mace, half a dozen 
corns of allspice bruised, and half a bay leaf, a 
pint of milk, an ounce of butter, and a tablespoon- 
ful of flour ', set them over a gentle fire, and stii

them frequently till they boil ; let them boil ten 
minutes, and leave them near the fire, to keep hot, 
till wanted. 

Mushroom Sauce, Broxvn. (No. 306.) 

Clean half a pint of small mushrooms, put them 
into half a pint of beef gravy, No. 186; thicken 
with flour and butter ; set them by the fire to stew 
gently for half an hour ; take off the scum as it 
rises ; squeeze in the juice of a lemon, and send 
it up. 

Italian Sauce, with Mushrooms. (No. 307.) 

Cut off the stalks, peel off the skin, scrape away 
the gills, and wash very clean two tablespoonsful of 
small white mushrooms ; chop them fine, and throw 
them into a little lemon juice to keep them white ; 
chop yourmushrooms very fine, and as quick as pos- 
sible, or they will turn black, and spoil the colour 
of your sauce; to prevent which, we recommend 
the lemon juice ; put them into a clean saucepan, 
with half a pint of sauce tournay, a teaspoonful of 
eschallots minced fine (and washed and dried in 
the corner of a clean towel) ; season with nutmeg, 
pepper, and salt; reduce the sauce a little, and 
send it up. 

Italian Ramolade, (No. 308.) 

This is a cold sauce, made without any heating, 

and is very fashionable in Italy, for fish which are 

to be eat cold, or any other cold dish. — Squeeze 

a large lemon, and half a China orange; add to

this half a teaspoon ful of basket salt, a little pep- 
per, and as much oil as there is of the other liquor ; 
shred some parsley very fine, wash and bone a 
couple of anchovies ; mix these together, and put 
them into the liquor ; then cut very small two tea- 
spoonsful of capers, put them in, stir all well to- 
gether, and send it to table. 

Obs, — \^ e want a cold sauce of this kind, and 
this is an exceeding good one for many things — 
■with cold fowl, turkey, or lamb — these are dry and 
insipid with salt alone, and our English cookery 
does not afford any method of eating them otlier- 
wise, without lieating them up, by wliich they lose 
a great deal of tlieir sweetness. This sauce is 
not too sharp, for the oil softens the vinegar ; 
and it is very finely relished with a mixed fla- 
vour by the other ingredients. 



Italian Ramolade, Hot, (No. 309.) \ 

Chop parsley very fine, an equal quantity ofi 
capers, shred a couple of anchovies, peel and' 
shave very thin two shallots, and a clove of gar-; 
lick ; all these (being cut and prepared separately); 
must be mixed together : set on a stewpan with ai 
quarter pint of gravy, add to it two tablespoonsfuli 
of oil, a spoonfid of mustard, and the juice of a 
large lemon ; when all this is hot together, put m, 
the ingredients, with some pepper, and a very lit-;

parsley, and put them into a sauce-boat, with three 
lablespoonsful of oil, and five of vinegar; add 
some ground black pepper ; stir all together, and 
send it up. 

Obs, — This sauce is in much esteem in France, 
where the people of taste, weary of so many rich 
dishes, to obtain the charm of variety, occasionally 
order the fare of the peasant.

Garlick Gravy. (No. 311.) 

Slice a pound and a half of veal or beef, pepper 
and salt it, and lay it in a stewpan with a couple 
of carrots split, and three turnips, and four cloves 
of garlick sliced, and a large spoonful of water ; 
set the stewpan over a gentle fire in a stove, and 
watch when the meat begins to stick to the pan ; 
when it does so, turn it, and let it be all very well 
browned, but take care it is not at all burnt; pour 
in a pint and a half of gravy, and put in a bunch

Throw some fresh and tender leaves of Burnet into 
boiling water; pat into the same water some mint, 
parsley, and half a dozen young onions: boil all 
together for a couple of minutes; then throw

squeezing them in a cloth, and then mince them 
as tine as possible. Set on a stewpan, with half a 
pint of veal gravy, put in a rocambole, and 
shred in an anchovy, squeeze in half a lemon,

fine oil : when it is all heated together, throw iu 
the chopped herbs, let it boil up two or three 
times, and serve it up hot with any thing roasted.

SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

Obs. — This is another of the sauces the Italians 
call rairgottes, and one of the best of that sort, the 
Burnet giving it a very agreeable flavour. 

Tarragon Sauce. (No. 314.) 

Pick and wash a handful of tarragon leaves, 
put them into a saucepan with half a pint of 
water ; let them stew till they are tender ; rub 
them through a sieve ; take three tablespoonsful 
of the water they boiled in^ an ounce of butter, 
and two teaspoonsful of flour ; warm these to- 
gether, and add two tablespoonsful of sherry, or 
Madeira, one of tarragon vinegjir, or the juice of 
half a lemon, and a tcaspoonful of sugar. 

. Herb Sauce Piquant e. (No. 3\5.) 

Mince a thin slice of a clove of garlick with 
some parsley, tarragon, chervil, burnet, and basil, 
each in proportion to llieir flavours : wlien well 
waslied and squeezed dry, let it simmer in a little 
water, without boiling ; press through a sieve, 
add a bit of butter, flour, pepper, and salt; boil 
it io a good consistence, and add lemon juice to 
make it relishing and smart tasted. 

Truffle Sauce. (No. 316.) 

Make a quart of beef gravy, No. 186, wash and 
peel a dozen truflies, put the peels into the gravy, 
let it boil half an hour ; then strain it into a clean 
saucepan ; then put in your truffles, let them boil 
half an hour longer, and serve up. 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

Truffles may almost always be procured at the 
respectable oil shops in London, either preserved 
in fat, or dried. 

Obs. — This is a sauce the French eat frequently 
v/ith butcher's meat; they make sauces of mush- 
rooms and morells in the same manner, and 
they are very fine. In this respect, they proceed 
upon much better principles than we in our cook- 
ery, who generally have butter for the foundation 
of our sauces. 

Fried Farsley. (No. 3 1 7.) 

\j^i it be well picked and washed, put it info a 
cloth, and swing it backwards and forwards till it 
is perfectly dry ; put it into a pan of hot fat, fry 
it quick, and have a slice ready to take it out the 
moment it is crisp, (if you let \i stay too long, it 
will look black,) put it on a sieve or coarse cloth 
before the fire to drain. 

Crisp Parsley, (No. 3 J 8.) 

Pick and wash a handful of young parsley, and 
shake it in a dry cloth to drain the water from it ; 
spread it on a sheet of clean paper, and lay it in 
the Dutch oven before the fire, and lay some very 
little bits of butter on it ; turn it frequently until it 
is quite crisp. This is a much more easy and 
elegant way of preparing it, than the usual way 
of frying it, which is not seldom ill done. 

Obs. — It is a very pretty garnish for lamb 
chops, &c.

Fried Bread Sippets. (No. 319.) 

Cut a slice rather more than a quarter of an 
inch thick, divide it ^vith a siiarp kitchen knife 
into pieces two inches square ; shape these into 
(riano^les, or crosses : put a tablcspoonful of clean 
dripping into an iron fryingpan ; when it is 
melted, put in the sippets, and fry them a light 
l)rown ; take them up with a fish-slice, and drain 
them on a hair sieve, that they may not be greasy. 

Ohs» — These arc a pretty garnish, and very 
relishing accompaniment, and will be an improve- 
ment to the flavour of the finest made dishes : 
they may also be sent up with peas and other 
soups ; but when intended for soups, they should 
be cut in bits from half to three quarters of an 
inch square. 

Fried Bread Crumbs. (No. 320.) 

Rub a pint of crumbs of bread (that has been 
baked three days) through a wire sieve, or fine 
cullender ; or you may rub tliem in a cloth till 
tbey are as small and fine as if they bad been 
grated ; put them into a stewpan with half an 
ounce of butter, place it over a moderate fire, and 
stir them about with a wooden spoon till they 
are the colour of a guinea ; pour them into a 
sieve, and let them stand ten minutes to drain. 

Obs. — These crumbs are sent up with roasted 
sweetbreads, or larks, pheasants, partridges, wood- 
cocks, and grouse, or moor game, especially if 
they have been kept long enough* 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 



Bread Sauce, (No. 32 1 .) 

Take half a pint of milk, put it on to boil, with 
an onion in it, and two blades of mace, and a 
dozen corns of black pepper tied up in a muslin 
bas^ ; when it has boiled a quarter of an hour, 
strain the milk, put it into a saucepan with two 
tablespoonsful of fine bread crumbs, (stale bread 
is best,) that have been rubbed through a cullen- 
der, or wire sieve, boil ten minutes in an opea 
saucepan, taking care they do not burn. 

Obs. — You may rub the bread in a clean 
cloth, till the crumbs are as fine as if they had 
been grated, or rubbed through a cullender. 

Plain Browning (No. 322.) 

Is a very convenient article in the kitchen, to 
add to those soups or sauces where it is supposed 
the deep brown of its complexion denotes the 
strength and savouriness of the composition, 
and is a very good substitute for what is called 
" India, or Japan soy." Put half a pound ofmoist 
sugar and a tablespoonful of water into a clean 
iron saucepan, set it over a slow fire, and keep 
stirring it with a wooden spoon till the sugar is 
burnt to a dark brown colour ; then add a quarter 
of a pint more water, let it boil up, take off the 
scum, and strain the liquor into bottles, which must 
be well stopped : if you have not any of this by 
you, and you wish to darken the colour of your 
sauces, pound a teaspoonfulof lumpsugar, and put 
into a large iron spoon, with as much water as 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

will dissolve it; hold it over a quick fire till it 
becomes a very dark brown ; mix it with your 
soup, &c., while it is hot. 

Obs. — The above are merely colouring mat- 
ters; most of the preparations under this title arc 
a medley of burnt butter, spices, catsup, wine, &c., 
but we recommend the rational epicure to be con- 
tent with the natural colour of soups and sauces, 
which to a well educated palate are much more 
agreeable without any of these cmpyreumatic ad- 
ditions. 

Greening, (No. 3!23.) 

Pound a handful of spinnage in a mortar, and 
squeeze the juice from it. 

Red, (No. 324.) 
With the juice of beet root or cochineal ; for 

Yellozv, (No. 325..) 

The yolks of eggs^ or saffron steeped and 
squeezed. 

Gravy for Roast Meat, (No. 32d) 

Most joints will afford sufficient trimmings, 
&;c. to make half a pint of plain gravy, for those 
that do not. 

When your meat is in the dish you intend to 
send it up on, pierce the interior part of the joint 
with a sharp skewer, and mix half a teaspoonful 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

of salt with a quarter pint of boiling water; pour 
part of it on the under side of the meat, and tlw; 
rest through the hole the spit came out of: be 
sure not to pour it over the top, or any part of the 
meat that will be seen, as it washes off the froth, 
and will spoil the look of the meat. If any gravy 
comes down in the dish, the cook will take care 
of it for the hash, if she is a good housewife. 

Obs — Some culinary professors, who think 
nothing can be excellent that is not extravagant, 
call this " Scots gravy," not, I believe, intending 
it, as it certainly is, a compliment to the laud- 
able and rational frugality of that intelligent and 
sober-minded people. 

Gravy for Boiled Meat (No. 327.) 

May be made from some parings and trimmings 
as for the roast meat, or pour from a quarter to 
half a pint of the liquor the meat was boiled in, 
into the dish with it, and pierce the inferior part 
of the joint with a sharp skewer. 

TVow JVow Sauce, for Bouilli Beef 
(No. 328.) 

Chop some parsley leaves very finely, quarter 
two or three pickled cucumbers, and divide them 
into small squares ; put them into a saucepan with 
a bit of butter as big as an egg, a tablespoonful of 
flour, and almost half a pint of the broth the beef 
was boiled in ; add a tablespoonful of vinegar, 
and the like quantity of mushroom catsup, two 
of good table beer, and a teaspobnful of made 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

muslaid ; let it simmer to£jellier till it is as thick 
as you wish it ; pour it over the bouilli, or send 
it up in a sauce-tureen. 

Obs. — If you like it more relishing, add to the 
above two teaspoonsful of capers, or a minced 
shallot, or one or two (oaspoonsful of shallot vine- 
gar, or basil or elder vinegar ; or strew over the 
meat minced capers, walnuts, red cabbage, or 
pickled cucumbers. 

2b make Gravy, 

As the object in making gravy is to completely 
extract the nutritious succulence of the meat, it is 
necessary that the meat should be well beaten, to 
comminute the containing vessels; and scored, to 
augment the surface to the action of the water. 

Take a pound of lean beef, beat it well with a 
rolling pin, score it in all directions, add pepper 
and salt, some scraped carrot, sliced onion or 
shallot, and allspice; put a small piece of but- 
ter at the bottom of the saucepan, and keep ifc 
over a very gentle fire for half an hour, when 
about a quaiter pint of rich and intrinsic gravy 
will be obtained ; add to the remaining meat as 
niuch water as will cover it, a small quantity of 
isinglass, and a piece of bread gradually toasted 
very brown ; let this gewWy simmer for an hour, 
or till more than half is evaporated ; strain it, and 
add it to the former. A. C. Junr,

slices, and about an ounce of bacon, or ham, or 
fresli butter ; lay them at the bottom of a two quart 
stevvpan, with one blade of mace tied up in a 
nosegay of a small spris: of sweet marjoram, the 
same of winter savory or lemon-thyme and parsley, 
a rolloflemon-peel, two cloves stuck into a middling 
sized onion, a dozen berries of allspice, and half 
a dozen of black pepper ; put to this three table- 
spoonsful of water, cover it, and set it on a slow 
fire till the liquor is all boiled away, and the meat 
has got very well browned, but take care it is 
vot at nil burnt: the time this will take depends 
so much on the state of the fire, the best way to 
make sure of your sauce is, when it has been boil- 
ing a few minutes, take oft' the cover and watch 
it; when the meat has got a nice brown, pour ia 
a quart of boiling water ; when it boils, catch 
the scum, and put in a crust of bread toasted very 
brown, and let it stew very gently for an hour 
and a half: take a spoonful of thickening, made 
as per receipt, No. 237, stir it into it by degrees, 
and let it simmer gently for a quarter of an hour 
longer, strain it through a fine hair sieve, or tammis 
cloth, put in a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, a 
saltspoonful of salt, and half a one of pepper. This 
will be a rich, high brown sauce for fish, fowl, 
or ragout. 

Obs. — If you wish to make it still more relish- 
ing, especially if it is to be eaten with game, or 
wild water-fowl; you may add a tablespoonful of 
port wine, the juice of half a lemon, and a 
roll of the rind cut thin, and if you think it not 
strong enough, use double the quantity of meat 
and bacon.

Ragcut SaucCy or strojig Beef Gravy with I 

Mushrooms. (No. 330.) \ 

Choose a dozen very large flaps, the big-gest \ 
full opened rniishrooiTis that you can gci^ cut out j 
t]}e sfaiks, peel off the skin, and scrape away the ■ 
gills, tlien strew over them a little pepper and salt. \ 
Cut three pounds of sleaks, half an inch thick, ' 
from a good part of the beef, where there is little 
fat ; the leg of mutton, or neck piece, is very pro- 
per for this purpose. Beat the steaks well, and \ 
season them moderately with a little salt. Cover i 
the bottom of a gallon stewpan with a couple of i 
slices of fat bacon ; upon these lay four or five of the \ 
mushrooms, then lay in some of the beef steaks, ■ 
upon these the rest of the mushrooms, and the ; 
rest of the beef steaks over them. Cut to pieces ! 
two onions and four carrots, half a dozen cloves, ; 
four blades of mace, a dozen and a half berries of ] 
black pepper, and a dozen of allspice, as much | 
grated nutmeg as will lay on a sixpence, and a I 
faggot of thyme, knotted marjoram, winter sa- ] 
vory, and parsley, whose stems when tied up j 
will be as big as two fingers : cover the stewpan, '■ 
and set it over a gentle iire, and watch how the i 
gravy comes ; w hen there is a good deal, set it on ' 
a better fire, and let it boil away till the meat is \ 
nearly dry, and it begins to stick to the pan ; (hen | 
uncover it, stir all about, and put the vegetables i 
and herbs undermost, that they may get brown, 
but take care they are not hurned: then pour in 
tl/ree pints of boiling water, and put it on a slow 
fire to simmer gently for an hour and a half. \ 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

Take a large tablespoonful of thickening*, made as 
per receipt, No. 257, and stir it into it by degrees, 
and let it simmer gently a quarter of an hour 
longer ; strain through a tammis sieve or cloth. 

Obs\ — This is the very *' ne plus ultra" of 
rich gravy" for sauces, ragouts, and made dishes, and 
far exceeds the most costly gravies of the French, 
into Avhich they put partridges, woodcocks, Sec, 
This quintessence of mushrooms and beef is in- 
comparably more savoury and delicious. 

Onion Gravi/, (No. 331.) 

Peel and slice two or three large onions, put 
them into a quart stevvpan, with a bit of butter 
about as big as a walnut, or a couple of table- 
spoonsful of water ; set it on a slow fire, and turn 
the onions about till the3^ are browned ; then add 
half a pint of good broth, and boil them till they 
are quite tender ; strain the broth from them, 
and mince them very fine ; thicken your sauce 
with flour and butter, and season it with pepper 
and salt ; put the onion into it, and simmer all 
together for five minutes. 

Ohs. — If you have no broth, put in half a pint 
of water, and just before you give it (he last boil 
up, add to it a large tablespoonful of mushroom 
catsup, and, if you like, the same quantity of port 
wine, or good ale.

four onions, two parsnips, or three carrots cut into 
thin slices ; turn them with a wooden spoon till 
they take a good brown colour ; put in a tea- 
spoonful of flour, stir well together, and add a 
pint and a half of boiling water, and a crust of 
bread toasted brown ; season it with a shallot 
minced fine, three blades of pounded mace, two 
drachms of soup-herb powder, and some pepper

port wine, mushroom and oyster catsup, or lemon 
pickle. 

Fish Gravy. (No. 333.) 

Skin and clean a pound of good eels or four floun- 
ders, cut them to pieces, and put them into a

sprig of lemon-thyme and sweet marjoram, or sa-

(the bones of any kind of roast meat broken to 
pieces, and stewed with it, are a great improve- 
ment ; as will also be the cuttings or trimmings 
of any joint you may have in the house ;) boil 
slowly till your gravy is reduced nearly half; 
then strain it into a clean stewpan, bruise the 
liver well, and rub it through a sieve with a wooden 
spoon, thicken it with a little bit of butter rolled 
in flour, and add a teaspoonful of browning, and 
a tablespoonful of red wine, and the same of any 
kind of catsup you think proper. 

Ohs. — If you have no cuttings or trimmings of 
meat, an anchovy will sometimes be a good sub- 
stitute. 

Mock Gravy Sauce. (No. S'55.) 

Haifa pint of water, and half as much good 
small beer, or two tablespoonsful of ale that is 
neither bitter nor stale, and a bundle of sweet 
herbs ; slice an onion, a small piece of thin lemon- 
peel, two cloves, a blade of mace, six berries of 
allspice, and the same of black pepper bruised, 
and a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, and the 
same quantity of port wine. Put a bit of butter 
about as big as a walnut into a saucepan ; when 
it is melted, put in a sliced onion, shake in a little

by degrees stir in the above ingredients, and let it 
stew for half an hour, and strain it well, and 
w hen cold take off the fat. 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

Obs. — Mushroom catsup supplies the place of 
meat better than any thing : if jou have not this, 
beer, wine, spices, and the aromatic roots and 
herbs variously combined, and thickened with 
flour and butter, are the usual substitutes for 
meat; but those families who are frequently in 
waul ofgravy sauces, (without plenty of which, no 
cook can support the credit of her kitchen,) should 
keep by them a stock of portable soup or glaze: 
by the help of this, and a portion of the above 
materials, or a tablespoonful of '' double relish," 
or '' sauce superlative," No. 429, a boat of the best 
gravy may be produced in a few minutes. 

Soup-Herb^ and soon made Savoury Sauce,

Put a quarter of an ounce of butter into a stew- 
pan; as soon as it is warm, mix with it half an 
ounce of flour, and half a drachm of zest: slir 
thoroughly together for a few minutes, and pour 
in by ck-grees almost half a pint of boiling water, 
and a large spoonful of port wine; let it'boil up 
for five minutes, stirring it all the time; season it

Orange Gra^y Sauce, for TVild JDuclxS. 
(No. 338.) 

Set on a saucepan whli half a pint of veal 
gravy, No. 192, half a dozen leaves of basil, aind 
an onion; let it boil up two or three times, and 
strain it off. Put to the clear gravy the juice of 
a very tine Seville orange, or two lemons, half a 
teaspoonful of salt, the same of pepper, and a 
glass of red wine ; send it up hot. 

Obs. — This is an excellent sauce for widgeon, 
teal, and all kinds of wild water-fowl. The com- 
mon way of gashing the breast, and squeezing in 
an orange, cooh and hardens the flesh, and com- 
pels every one to eat duck that way : those 
who have the true taste for wild-fowl eat them 
very little done, and without any sauce. Gra- 
vies should always be sent up in a boat ; tliey 
keep hot longer, and it leaves it to the choice of 
the company to partake of it or not, as they like ; 
and for those who choose it, there is no way of 
having the flavour of the pepper and o.range so 
well, and with so little hurt to the flesh of the 
fowl. 

Woodcock Sauce, (No. 339.) 

^Vhen (he woodcocks are roasted take out the 
guts and livers, bruise them Xo a. mash with a 
spoon, press it through your sieve, and sprinkle 
on them a little pepper and salt, add two large 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 

spoonsful of^ood gravy, and a small piece of but- 
ter rolled in flour ; boil up together. 

Pour it into a hot dish, cut up the woodcocks 
in it, and send thera to table. 



Snipe Sauce. (No. 340.) 

The snipe in a great measure owes i(s sauce to ; 
itself, and there is a way of making it very fine, j 

It is usual to roast these birds without drawing ; \ 
when they are done enough take them off the spit, | 
and take out the entrails and the liver, chop them j 
upon a trencher : set on a small saucepan, with ! 
some veal gravy and red wine, seasoned with a ; 
little pepper and salt ; put in the entrails and the ! 
liver, mash them well together, and squeeze in \ 
the juice of an orange ; thicken your sauce with | 
a little flour. I 

Ohs^ — There are two ways of using this sauce ; ■ 
either pour it into a dish, and lay in the snipes 
over it, or make it into a dish with them in the fol- 
lowing manner ; cut the birds to pieces, put them 
into the sauce when it is well thickened, pour the ■ 
whole into a dish, and squeeze in the juice of half | 
a lemon. i 

Bonne Bouche, for Goose or Duck, 
(No. 341.)

Savoury Sauce for Roast Pork or Geese, 8^c, 
(No. 342.) 

Mince a large onion very fine, put half an ounce 
of butter into a pint stewpan, fry it, turning it often 
with a wooden spoon, till it takes a light brown 
colour, then add two tablespoonsful of thickening, 
No. 257, a tablespoonful of mushroom catsup, 
the same of port wine, and half a pint of warm 
water, a quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper, the 
same of salt ; let them boil half an hour, then add 
a small teaspoonful of mustard, and the juice of 
half a lemon, or one or two teaspoonsful of 
vinegar. 

06s. — The French call this sauce " Robert," 
(the name of the cook who invented it,) and are 
very fond of it with many things. 

Turtle Sauce. (No. 343.) 

Put into your stewpan a pint of beef or veal 
cuUis, No. 189, or No. 192, add a wineglass of 
Madeira, the juice of half a lemon, and the peel 
of a quarter of a lemon, a few leaves of basil, half 
a bay leaf, and a few grains of Cayenne pepper -, 



* Thus far the above is frdra Dr. Hunter's " Culina," wlio 
says it is a secret worth knowing : we agree with him, and so 
teil it here, with a little addition, which we think renders it a 
still more gratifying communication. 



SAUCES AND GRAVIII^. 

\ci lliem simmer together for ten minutes : you. 
may introduce a dozen turtle forcemeat balls ; see 
Receipt, ^'o. 380, &c. 

Obs. — This is a delicious sauce for stewed veal, 
or veal cutlets, or any dish you dress turtle 
fashion, which itself owes all its estimation io the 
sauce that is made for it ; without which, it would 
be as insipid as any other fish is without sauce. 

lVi77e Sauce fo7^ Venison, (No. 344.) 



A quarter of a pint of claret, or port wine, half i

saucepan, half a pint of the best white-wine vine- 
gar, and a quarter of a pound of the finest loaf- ^ 
sugar ; set it over the fire, and. let it simmer \ 
gently ; skim it carefully, and pour it through a ' 
flannel jelly bag, and send it up in a basin.

is melted, pour it into a sauce-boat. \ 

Obs. — Many add port wine. j 



SAtJCES AND GRAV7E5. 



Mutton Gravijfor Vtnison, (No. 347.) 

The best gravy for venison, is that made of the 
trimmings of tlie joint: if this is all used, and 
you have not trimmings enough, cut a scrag of 
mutton in pieces, and fry it a little brown in an 
iron fryingpan ; put it into a clean stevvpan, with 
a quart of boiling water, cover it close, and let it 
simmer gently for an hour, then uncover yout 
stewpan, let it reduce to a pint, drain it 
through a hair sieve, take the fat off, and send it 
up in a boat. It is only to be seasoned with salt, 
that it may not overpower the natural flavour of 
tJie meat. 

Curry Sauce (No. 348.) 

Is made by stirring a sufficient quantity of 
curry powder into gravy, or melted butter. The 
composition of curry powder varies so much, 
we cannot give any specific receipt as to the 
quantity. The cook must add it by degrees, 
tasting as she proceeds, and taking care not to put 
in too much. 

Soup-htrh and Savoury Powder^ or Double 
Relish Sauce, (No. 34i^.) 

Is made in the same way with the powder.

bruise them lo break ibe fibres, and make (hem part 
with their juice; put them into a stewpan, and 
let them sweat over a slow fire, strew over them 
some flour, and keep stirring them, moisten them 
with half a pint of water and a tablespoonful of 
good small beer ; season it with twelve berries of 
Jamaica, and the same of black pepper, and some 
sweet herbs ; let it simmer gently : if not thick 
enough, add a bit of butter and some flour : let it 
warm together, and strain it. 

Essence of Ham. (No. 351.) - 

Boil a ham in the usual way ; when it is done 
enough, run an iron skewer through it in several 
places ; the gravy that comes from it is the " true 
essence of ham:'''' put it, while hot, into jelly 
glasses ; the fat that runs out with the gravy will 
cover the top, and preserve it for six months. 
The ham will still do for a cold relish, or for 
potting. 

Ohs. — This is certainly the very quintessence 
of ham, but so expensive, it is only attainable by 
gourmands of the first magnitude. The following 
preparation will supply its place at a moderate 
cost. 

Ham Sauce. (No. 35^.) 

You must have a fine and well flavoured 
ham, or the sauce will be good for nothing. 
Take care to preserve the gravy that runs 
from the ham when it is cut at table; and 
when the ham is pretty well eaten down, so that 
it cannot appear again at taWe^ nor my handsome

slices be cut from it, pick all the meat clear from 
the bone, (do not put in any of the rusty or de- 
cayed parts,) beat it well with a rolling pin, that 
it may be broken in every part ; put this mash 
into a saucepan, with a slice of fat bacon at the 
bottom, and some carrot and an onion cut into 
slices, and pour in two or three tablespoonsful of 
water; set it over a slow fire for about ten minutes; 
stir it about till it sticks to the bottom of the stew- 
pan ; then dredge in a little flour, and keep stir- 
ring it about for some time, for it will more and 
more stick to the bottom ; after some time, add to 
it its own gravy that 3^ou have saved, and pour 
in half a pint of gravy, (or water and a tablespoon- 
ful of catsup, if you have no gravy,) and add a 
small sprig of lemon-thyme, sweet marjoram, and 
winter-savory, two leaves of sweet basil, and a 
dozen corns of black pepper ; cover up, and let it 
stew very gently, over a very slow fire, for about 
forty minutes ; strain off the gravy through a fine 
sieve ; skim it well ; clear it with the white of an 
eggy give it a boil up, strain through a tammis, 
and when cold bottle it for use. 

Obs. — This ham sauce is made with very 
moderate expense, and is equal to the most extra- 
vagant essences of ham : though thus easily and 
cheaply obtained, it is a very rich article of the 
sauce kind, and will be found very convenient to 
heighten the flavour of ragouts, gravies, &c., and 
for veal, capons, &c.

(No. 357.) 

Spread some slices of lean veal and ham at tlie 
bottom of a stewpan, with a carrot, a bundle of 
sweet herbs, and a couple of onions; cover it, and 
let it sweat on a slow fire till it is as deep a brown 
as you would have it, then pour in a quart of 
broth or water; if it is water, it must be more 
reduced than if it is broth ; set it on to boil; skim 
it well, and put in half a dozen corns of black

it to eat like venison, instead of the onion put in 
two cloves, a tablespoonful of currant jelly, and

Bechamel Sauce. (No. 3G4.) 

Cut a quarter of a pound of lean Lam and a 
pound of veal into small dice, put it into a two 
quart stewpan, with three ounces of butter, two 
small young onions tied up with a sprig of pars- 
ley and a couple of cloves, (and lialf a dozen 
mushrooms if you hav^e them,) set the stewpan 
over a clear slow stove to reduce ; stir up the in • 
gredients with a wooden spoon, but take care it 
does not catch colour, shake in two tablespoonsful 
of fine sifted flour, and turn it about and incorporate 
it with the sauce ; when it is well mixed^ moisten 
it by degrees with a pint and a half of new milk, 
taking care to keep your stewpan moving, that the 
ingredients may not catch ; let it bod over a brisk 
lire for an hour; if it gets too thick, add some 
more milk. Do not put in any salt, as the ham 
will make it salt enough ; strain throngli atammis. 
In fact, if common veal broth be boiled, scum- 
med, thickened with flour and butter, and thinned 
again with some more veal broth, boiled a quarter 
of an hour longer, till it is reduced to the same quan- 
tity it was before you added the veal broth, passed 
through a fine sieve, ortammis, and have a sufti- 
cient quantity of cream to make it white, and just 
simmered together for five minutes, (but not suf- 
fered to boil;) you will hav^e a genuine Bechamel. 

Obs. — Bechamel implies a thick white sauce, 
approacliing to a batter, and takes its name from 
a wealthy French marquess, maitre d^hotel de 
Louis XI F, and firaous for his patronage of

composition. Most of the French sauces take 
their name from the person ^vhose palate they 
first pleased, as " a la Ma'mtenon ,'* or from some 
famous cook who invented them, as " Sauce Ro- 
bart;' " a la Montizeur;' &c. By my ZEST, 
Nos. 255 and 386, I also put in my claim to im- 
mortality of fame. 

Poiv7^ade Sauce, (No. 365.) 

Mince fine a small onion, put it into a quart 
stevvpan, with a little butter, and a shallot 
shred fine, or a very little bit of garlick, cloves, 
sweet herbs, and basil, if you like their flavour ; 
when it has fried a few minutes, add half a pint 
of beef or veal gravy, or warm water, and a table- 
spoonful of vhiegar ; skim it and strain it well ; 
thicken it with a little flour and butter, and squeeze 
in the juice of half a lemon. 

Obs. — This sauce is very much used among 
foreigners: whoever has looked into any of their 
books of cookery, will remember they order many 
of their dishes to be sent up with '' poivrade ;" 
by which may generally be understood, a sauce, 
in the compositwn of which, pepper and vinegar 
are predominant. ' 

Poivrade Sauce cold. (No. 366.) 

Behead and bone two anchovies, pound them 
in a marble mortar, with two tablespoonsful of 
salad oil, and a teaspoonful of made mustard, 
some parsley leaves, and a shallot minced fine ; 
when well mixed, add vinegar to your taste, and 
pass it through a hair sieve, and season it with 
pepper and salt. 

Obs. — A very good sauce for cold meat.

Sauce Tournke. (No. 36?.) 

Have ready a pint of beef or veal broth in a 
quart stewpan ; put into another stewpan an ounce 
of butter; when it is melted, shake in as much 
flour as will make it a stiff paste ; stir till it is 
well mixed, but be careful not io let it catch' 
colour : mix this with the broth, and s(ir till it is 
smooth ; season it with a small bundle of joung 
onions and parsley, six berries of allspice, 
and six mushrooms if you have them ; cover 
your stewpan closely, and set it on the corner of 
the stove to simmer gently for an hour, and 
strain your sauce through a tammis. 

Sauce Veloute. (No. 368.) 

Pour four tablespoonsful of sauce tournee info a 
pint stewpan ; wlien the sauce is hot, put in two 
tablespoonsful of good thick cream ; season with 
a little salt ; strain through a tammis, and send it 
up hot. 

Ohs, — This is also from the French kitchen, 
and is, in fact, only a richer preparation of sauce 
tournee. 

Mustard in a Minute. (No. 369.) 

Mix very gradually together, in a marble or 
wedgewood mortar, an ounce of flour of mustard, 
with three tablespoonsful of milk, and half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and the same of sugar. 

Ohs, — Mustard made in this manner is not at

all bitter, and may therefore be instantly brought 
to table. 

Mustard to make, (No. 370.) 

Mix by degrees, by rubbing together in a 
mortar, the best Durham flour of mustard with 
cold water in which scraped horseradish has been 
boiled, rub it well together till it is quite smooth : 
keep it in a stone jar, closely stopped : only put 
as much into the mustard pot as will be usetl in 
ci day or two. The ready made keeping mustard,, 
that is prepared at the oil shops, is mixed with 
one fourth part salt : this is useful to preserve it, 
if it is to be kept long; otherwise, by all means 
omit it. The best way of eating salt is ia 
substance. 

%* See also Recipe, No. 427. 

Obs. — Some opulent epicures mix their mustard 
with sherry or Madeira wine, or distilled vinegar, 
instead of horseradish water. 

The French flavour their mustard with Cham- 
paigne, and other wines, capers, anchovies, tar- 
ragon or elder vinegar, garlick, shallot, celery,: 
and fine herbs, truffles, &c. &c. 

Salt. (No. 371.) 

Common sail is more relishing than basket salt ; 
it should be prepared for the table by drying iii; 
in a plate before the fire, and then putting it on 
clean paper ; roll it with a rolling pin ; or, what is 
still better, pound it in a mortar till it is quite 
fine, it zoill look as well as basket salt.

Salad Sauce, (No. 372.) 



Boil a couple of eggs for ten minutes, put tlieiw ; 
into a basin of cold water for half an hour, as the j 
yolks must be quite hard and cold, or they will ^ 
not incorporate well with the oil. Rub them i 
through a sieve with a wooden spoon, and mix \ 
them with a teaspoonfnl of water, the same quantity i 
of made mustard, and four tablespoonsful of vine- ! 
gar; when well mixed together, add three table- ; 
spoonsful of oil, and rub it with the other ingredi- 
ents till thoroughly incorporated with tliem ; cut up : 
the white of the egg and garnish the top of the salad j 
with it. Let the sauce remain at the bottom of the j 
salad bowl, and do not stir up with the salad till it i 
is to be eaten. '■ 

Obs. — This mixture is sometimes made with: 
cream instead of oil, and flavoured with basil, • 
tarragon, or elder vinegar, essence of celery, ■ 
lemon pickle, or an anchovy : of these we prefer; 
the basil vinegar, see No. 397. |

covej- them : bruise and stir them frequently for 
four days ; strain them ; and to every pint of the 
liquor add a pound of lump sugar : boil for a 
quarter of an hour, taking off the scum as it rises ; 
add to each pint a glass of brandy, and bottle it : 
when used, it may be mixed in about eight parts 
of water, and is a most excellent cooling beverage 
to assuage thirst in fevers and colds, &c., and ii 
agreeable to most palates. 



5A1CES. GRAVIES, \'C. 



Sj/ruj) Of Lemons. (Ko. 391.) • " 

A pint of fresh lemon juice, a pound and aj 
half of lurap sugar ; dissolve i( in a gentle heat, 
scum it, and add an ounce of ihin cut lemon-peel ;| 
let tbem all simmer together for a few minutes. j 
When cold, bottle it and cork it closely, and keep: 
it in a cool place. 

Or, \ 

Dissolve an ounce of crystallized lemou-acid! 
in a pint of clarified syrup. ^ 

Orange Syrup, for Puddings. (Xo. 392.) '■ 

Squeeze the oranges, and strain the juice from 
X]\e pulp into a large pot, and boil it up, ^vith a 
pound of fine sugar to each pint of juice ; skim it 
■well : let it stand till cold, and then bottle it, and 
cork it well. 

Syi^up of Orange or Lemon Peel (No. 39^3.) 

Fresh outer rind of Seville orange or lemon-peel, 
three ounces, apothecaries' weight : boiling water, 
a pint and a half: infuse thera for a night in a close 
vessel ; then strain the liquor; let it stand to settle; 
and having poured it ofi' clear from the sediment, 
dissolve in it two pounds of double refined and 
finely pounded loaf sugar, and make it into a 
syrup with a gentle heat"]! 

Ohs. — In making this syrup, the sugar must 
be dissolved in the infusion with as gentle a heat 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. 

as possible, to prevent the exhalation of the vola- 
tile parts of the peel. This syrup possesses a 
great share of the fine flavour of the orange, or 
lemon-peel. 

Syrup of Nutmegs. (No. 39-i.) 

Nutmegs grated, two ounces ; boiling water, a 
pint ; digest in a close vessel for twenty-four 
hours ; strain, and add to it a pound of double re- 
fined and powdered loaf sugar, and an eg^ beat up 
with a little cold water : boil up together, skim it 
perfectly clean, and reduce it to a syrup : when 
cold, add a quarter pint of brandy to it. 

Obs, — This syrup is strongly impregnated 
with the nutmeg, and is b. most agreeable and con- 
venient ingredient in puddings, &c., and all 
sweet dishes in which nutmegs are used. Cloves, 
cinnamon, and mace, may be prepared in the 
same manner. 

Syrup of Vinegar. (No. S95^ 

Let two pints and a half of the best distilled 
wine vinegar be boiled with three pounds and a 
half of lump sugar, till a syrup is formed: this 
solution is a very pleasant and cheap substitute 
for the syrup of lemons. 

The juice of mulberries, raspberries, and black 
currants, may be incorporated with syrup in a 
similar way ; and are cooling, pleasant drinks, 
which may be advantageously employed for miti* 
gating thirst in bilious and inflammiitory disorders.

Tarragon Vinegar (No. 396.) ' 

Is a very asrreeable addition to soup and salad 
sauce, and is thus made. Put a quarter pound of 
fresh gathered tarragon leaves (which should be; 
gathered just before it flowers.) into a jar, with, 
a quart of the best distilled wine vinegar, for thcj 
space of fourteen days, in a warm situation, wheit' 
it should be strained through a flannel bag: add' 
a drachm of isinglass, and put it into a dryi 
jar; let it stand four-and-twenty hours, till it i^ 
fine ; jX)ur it into half pint bottles ; cork themj 
carefully, and keep them in a dry place. •; 

Ohs. — You may prepare elder-flower and^ 
other vinegars in the same manner: elder audi 
tarragon are those in most general use in this] 
country. Our neighbours, the French, prepare; 
vinegars flavoured with celery, cucumbers,^ 
capsicums, garlick, onion, capers, burnet, truflles, 
Seville orange-peel, ginger ; in short, they make 
them of almost every herb, fruit, flower and spice j 
separately, and in innumerable combinations. ! 

J 

Basil Vinegar, (No. ^i:) \ 

Steep an ounce of dried and sifted sweet basil | 
in a pint of the best white wine vinegar for four-! 
teen days. \ 

Ohs, — This is a very agreeable addition to \ 
many sauces, soups, and made dishes ; and the i 
mixture usually made for salads. i 

It is the basis of the <* salad sauce" sold in the ! 
oil shops, I 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. 



Mint Vinegar, (No. 398.) 

This is made precisely in the same manner, 
and with the same proportions, as the preceding 
receipt. It is a favourite relish with lamb. 

Essence of Vinegar, (No. 599-) 

During the intense frosts of winter put some 
vinegar into shallow dishes, and the watery parts 
will be converted into ice ; but the spirituous, or 
acetous basis, remains in a fluid state ; so that by 
repeating this process, one pint of strong vinegar 
may, in very cold seasons, be reduced to a few 
tablespoonsful of the essence. 

Garlick Vinegar, (No. 400.) 

Chop two ounces of garlick very fine, put 
them into a quart of boiling hot white wine vine- 
gar, stop the jar \ery close, and let it steep ten. 
days, shaking it well every day; then pour off 
the clear liquor into small bottles. 

0^5. — The cook must be careful not to use 
too much of this : a few drops of it will impreg- 
nate a pint of gravy with a sufficient taste of the 
garlick; the flavour of which, when slight and 
well blended, is one of the finest ingredients we 
have; when used in excess, the most offen- 
sive : the best way to use garlick, is to send up 
some of this vinegar in a cruet, and let the com" 
pany flavour their own sauce as they lii^e. 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. 



, Eshallot Vinegar (No. 401.) \ 

Is made in the same manner, and the cools 
should never be without it ; it costs scarcely ?iny 
thing, and will save her an immense deal of trou- 
ble in flavouring all soups and sauces that she 
wishes to s\\Q a taste of onion. 



Eshallot TV'me. (No. 402.) 

Infuse an ounce and a half of eshallots, minced 
fine, in a pint of port wine for ten days. 

0^5. — This is rather the most expensive, bui 
infiniteli/ the most elegant preparation of eshallot 
and gives the onion flavour to soups and sauce; 
inore agreeably than any other way : it also doej 
not at all leave an unpleasant taste in the raoutli 
and to the breath, which all the other prepara 
tions of garlick, onion, &c. do. 

Camp Vmega7\ (No. 403.) ■ 

Cayenne pepper, a quarter of an ounce. 

Cochineal, half a drachm. 

Soy, two tablespoonsful. ' 

Walnut catsup, ditto. 

Two anchovies chopped. ' 

A small clove of garlick minced fine. 
Steep all for a month in a pint of best vinegar, 
frequently shaking the bottle : strain through ii 
tammis, and keep it in small bottles corked as well 
as possible. 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. 



Brochard Sauce, for Cold Meat, (No. 404.) 

Six shallots, minced fine. 
Two tablespoonsful of made mustard. 
Six anchovies pounded. 
Haifa pint of vinegar. 
Four tablespoonsful of sweet oil. 
Two teaspoonsful of ground black pepper. 
One teaspoonful of salt, and the rind of a lemon. 
Bottle it. 

Essence of Cayenne. (No. 405.) 

Put an ounce of Cayenne pepper into half a 
pint of strong proof spirit ; let it steep for a fort- 
night, and then pour off the clear liquor. 

This is nearli/ equal to fresh Chili juice. 

Obs, — A few drops will be found extremely 
convenient for the extempore seasoning and finish- 
ing of soup, sauces, &c., its flavour being instantly 
and equally difi'used. 

Prepared Lemon Juice. (No. 406.) 

Tn the following manner you may prepare and 
preserve the juice of lemons, limes, or oranges, 
for punch, lemonade, iced creams, &c. 

Pare very thin, or rasp off the outside rinds of 
the fruit with a bread grater, till you have got 
about a quarter pint of them ; put tliem into a 
wide mouthed bottle, pour in half a pint of good 
brandy, and set the bottle in a warm situation for 
three days, frequently shaking it up. Then 
squeeze as m«ch fruit as will yield a quart of 
k2 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. i 

juice : let it settle, and run it through a flannel | 
bag : squeeze the brandy from the rinds, and add l 
it to the juice of the fruits ; bottle it, and cork it : 
well. 

Obs. — This will keep for years, and improve ; 
in flavour; and make the finest punch, &c., by . 
only adding sugar, spirits, water, &c. to the . 
palate. 

Essence of Lemo7i-PeeL (No. 407.) ' 

Wash and clean the lemons; let them get per- ■ 
fectly dry ; take a lump of loaf sugar, and rub J 
them till all the yellow rind is taken up by the 
sugar ; scrape off the surface of the sugar into a i 
preserving pot, and press it hard down ; cover it , 
very close, and it will keep for twelve months, i 
In the same way you may get the essence of i 
Seville orange-peel. I 

Ohs. — This method of procuring and pre- ' 
serving the flavour of lemon-peel is far superior \ 
to the common practice of paring off the rind, or 
grating it, and pounding or mixing that v/ith i 
sugar: in this process, you obtain the whole of| 
the fine, fragrant, essential oil, in which is con- ] 
tained the flavour. \ 

Quint-Essence of Lemon Peel, (No. 408.) , 

Best oil of lemon, one drachm. 

Strongest spirit of wine, two ounces, ' 

such as will burn dry in a silver spoon, intro- 
duced by degrees, till the spirit kills or over- 
powers, and completely mixes with the oil. This 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. ! 

is a most elegant and useful preparation, posses- 
sing all the delightful fragrance and flavour of the j 
freshest lemon-peel. 

Obs. — A few drops on the sugar you make 
punch v/ith, will instantly impregnate it with a ; 
much finer flavour than the troublesome and 
tedious method of grating the rind, or rubbing the 
sugar on it. It will be found a superlative sub' 
stltute for fresh lemon-peel^ for every purpose \ 
that it is used for ; blanc mange, jellies, custards, 
ice, negus, lemonade, and pies, puddings, stuf- ' 
flngs, soups, sauces, and ragouts, to which it im- 
mediately gives a most delicious zest, i 

Spirit of Celerij. (No. 409.) ; 

Strong spirit of wine, two ounces. ; 

Celery seed, three drachms. .' 

Let it steep for a fortnight : set the bottle, for the , 

f.rst two or three days, where it will receive a ; 

heat of one hundred degrees, Fahrenheit's ther- : 

momeier. j 

Obs. ■ — A few drops mil fiarour a pint of ^ 
broth and are an excellent ' addition to pease 

and other soups, and the salad mixture of oil, \ 

vinegar, &c. i 

Preserved Juice of Fruits without Sugar. 
(No. 410.) 

Raspberries, strawberries, mulberries, elderber-

gatherthem perfectly dry: pickand clean them from ! 
stalks and leaves, and put them into a preserving- ■

pan over a slow charcoal fire : mash them to a pulp, 
and turn them into a stone pan ; cover down with 
a cloth till they are cool; press out all the juice, 
and run it through a jelly bag; and to each 
quart add a quarter pint of brandy, or half that 
quantity of strong spirits of wine : cork down in 
clean, dry bottles: kept in a good cellar, it will be 
good for two years, for all the purposes of iced 
creams, jellies, and cooling beverage, by adding 
tlie juice of lemons, sugar, &c. &c. 

Essence of Ginger. (No. 411.) 

Four ounces of powdered ginger in a quart of 
rectUied spirit, apothecaries' measure : let it stand 
for ten days, shaking it up each day. 

Ohs. — This would be more properly called 
" tincture of ginger :" however, as it has obtained 
the name of " essence," so let it be called. 

Essence of A lisp ice. (No. 4 1 2 . ) 

Oil of pimento, half a drachm, apothecaries'

Of allspice bruised, three ounces. 
Brandy, a quart, apothecaries' measure.

SAUCE SUPERLATIVE. (No, 429.) 

Port wine and mushroom catsup, a pint of each. 

Vinegar, a quarter pint. 
Or, what is better, 

Haifa pint of walnut or other pickle liquor. 
But to make sauce most superlative, instead of 
either of the above, 

Six drachms avoirdupois of crystallized acid of 
lemon. 

Pounded anchovy, an ounce. 

Dried and pounded parsley, an ounce. 

Dried winter-savory, two ounces. 

Fresh lemon-peel pared xery thiu^ an ounce. 

Peeled and sliced cshallots, half au ounce. 

Allspice and 

Black pepper powdered, a quarter ounce each. 

Ginger and 

Mace powdered, two drachms each.

Celery-seed bruised, a drachm. All avoirdu- 
poise zceig/if. 
Put all into a wide mouth bottle, stop it close, 
shake it up every day for a fortnight, and strain 
it, (when some think it improved by the addition 
of a quarter pint of thick browning, see No. 322, 
or 436,) and you will have a most incomparably 
elegant and '' delicious double relish and 
SAUCE SUPERLATIVE," extremely acceptable and 
refreshing to tlie lingual nerves. 

%f* The above receipt I received from William Kitch" 
iner, M. D., zvho considers this composition as the " chef- 
d'oeuvre" of mani/ experiments he has made, for the pujyose

their own sauces : it is equally agreeable zvithfish, poultry, or 
ragouts ; and as a fair lady may make it herself , she may also 
be certain all the ingredients are stceet and zcholesome. 

0^5. — Under an infinity of circumstances, a 
cook raaj'-bein want of the substances necessary 
to make sauce ; the above composition of proper 
proportions of the several articles from ^vhich the 
various gravies derive their flavour, will be found 
a very superlative substitute for gravy sauce, by 
mixing two tablespoons fill with half a pint of 
melted butter : five minutes will finish a boat of 
very relishing sauce. 

3Iock Anchovies. (No. 430.) 

Take half a peck of fresh sprats, do not wash 
them, only draw them at the gills, and put them 
into stone jars with the following mixture. Two 
pounds of common salt, a pound of saltpetre, 
two ounces of white pepper, and the same quan- 
tity of lump sugar, half an ounce of lemon- 
peel, and four or five bay-leaves ; pound these all 
■well together ; put a layer of this at the bottom 
of the jar, then a layer of sprats, and so alter- 
nately till the jar is full ; tie them down close 
with a bladder, and keep them in a cold dry 
place, and they will be ready for use in six 
months : if you turn the jar upside down twice a 
week, they will be ready in half that time. 

Ohs, — Smelts are prepared in the same 
manner. 

Essence of Mock Anchovies, (No. 43 1 .) 
When ^the preceeding preparation has been 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. 

kept a year or more, it may be made into es- 
sence by pounding the fish in a marble mortar 
till they are quite fine, and adding to them 
the liquor they were pickled in ; if there is not 
sufficient of this, to make it thinner you may 
dilute it with cold spring water ; when well 
mixed, strain through a hair sieve, and bottle it 
for use. 

3Iock Essence of Ancho'cies. (No. 432.) 

Boil a quart of stale ale for a quarter of au hour, 
let it stand till it is cold ; take five Dutch pickled 
herrings with their liquor, (take off" the heads and 
roes,) mince them fine, put them into the beer, 
with a stick of horseradish scraped fine; let it boil 
twenty minutes ; strain it ; hold a clean fryingpan, 
over the fire' that it may be quite dry, put 
a quarter of a pound of flour in it ; keep stirring 
it with a wooden spoon, till it is the colour of 
essence of anchovies ; put the liquor to it, and 
stir it together till it boils ; let it boil a quarter of 
an hour ; when cold, bottle it ; if not of sufficient 
colour, put a little bole armeniac to it. 

Obs, — These three preparations are among the 
best of the imitations of anchovy, and are fre- 
quently sold for it, and for common palates may 
do very well ; but to impart to artificial anchovies 
the delicious flavour of the Gorgona fish, so as to 
impose upon a gourmand of good taste, we fear 
will still remain in the catalogue of the sauce- 
maker's desiderata. 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, <ScC. 



ESSENCE OF ANCHOVY. (No. 433.) 

The goodness of (his preparation depends almost 
entirely on having fine mellow fish, that have 
been in pickle long enough (i. e. about twelve 
months) io dissolve easily, yet are not at all 
rusty. It has been said that some shops have a 
trick of putting anchovy liquor on pickled sprats : 
you will easily discover this by washing o.'ie of 
thera, and tasting the flesh of it, which in the 
finest anchovies is mellow, red, and high flavDuredj 
and the bone moist and oily. 

Put into a marble mortar a pound of anchovies, 
beat them to a pulp, and put them into a sauce- 
pan with a quart and half a pint of water, let them 
simmer rerj/ gently by the side of a slow fire for an 
hour and a half, frequently stirring them together. 
(Thisis the proper way to perfectly dissolve the fish, 
and completely incorporate it with the water, so 
that it may continue suspended, and not separate. 
To pr re cut the separation of essence of av.chox)!/^ 
various other expedients have been tried, such as 
the addition of mucilage, flour, oatmeal, or gum ; 
but where any of these things are added, it does 
not keep half so well as it does without thera.) 
vSkiin it well, and add to it an ounce of salt, and a 
drachm of Cayenne pepper ; let it simmer 
together ten minutes longer, and strain it. If this 
is properly made, a tablespoonful will be about 
equal io an anchovy. 

Obs. — It must he kept in a rery close stopped 
bottle ; for if the air gets to it, the fish takes the 
rust, and it is spoiled cliiectlj/- Some of the oil- 



SAUCES, GEAVIES, &C. 

shops colour this with bole armeniac, rose pink, 
Venice-red, &c. ; but all these additions deterio- 
rate the flavour of the anchovy, and the palate 
and stomach suffer for the gratification of the 
eye, which, in culinary concerns, will never 
be indulged by the sagacious gourmand^ at the 
expense of these two primum mobiles of his 
pursuits. 

*,^* If essG.nce of anchovy he made for the use of private 
families, it should he with goed sherry or Madeira wine, 
(instead of water, as directed above,) not merely to enrich 
the flavour of the sauce, but it will keep infinitely better. 



Anchovy Paste, (No. 434.) 

Wash your anchovies, rub off the scales, and 
take away the head, bones, and fins ; pound 
the meat in a marble mortar, with a very little 
fresh butter, till it becomes a smooth paste, theij 
rub it through a fine sieve, and pot it ; cover it 
very closely, and keep it in a: cool place. 

Obs. — This is sometimes made into a stiffer 
paste by using a little spice, or Cayenne, and a 
very little brandy, instead of butter. The former 
preparation is very convenient for sauces, the 
latter makes a most savoury sandwich. It is an 
excellent garnish for fish, put in pats round the 
edge of the dish.

jSne pavyder, Ayhich, in a well-stopped botile, will 
keep for years. It is a very savoury relish 
spriuk|ed,on bread and butter foE a sandwich. 

SOY. (No. 456.) 

To a small teacupful of water add half a pound 
6f treacle, or moist or lump sugar; set it on the 
fire in an iron pot till it boils to a dark brown colour, 
keep stirring it, and take great care, or it wilt 
burn: when it is become quite thick, add to it 
a quarter ounce of salt, and gradually as much 
water as will reduce it to the consistence of soy ; 
mix well together, and boil up for five minutes. 
The addition of a quarter of a pint of good strong 
beef glaze* to three quarters of a pint of the burnt 
sugar will very much improve it : those who like 
a gout of acid may add vinegar. 

Obs.-^Th'is will hardly be told from what is 
commonli/ called " genuine India soi/y' and will 
answer every purpose that is used for. Burnettrea- 
cle, or sugar, and Cliili vinegar, garlick, and 
pickled fish, appear to be the bases of almost all the 
sauces that are now sold in the oil-shops. Although 
indefatigable research and experiment has put us 
in possession of all these compositions, it would 
not be quite fair to enrich the cook at the expense 
of the oilman, &c. 

* See No. 187. Beef glaze is notliing more than strong beef 
gravy reduced to the consistence of a syrup that will hani^ 
about the spoonc

Essence of Walnuts, (No. 437.) 

Take walnuts of the size for picklin^^, cut and 
pound them in a marble mortar, sprinkle a little 
salt over them, and stir them up, and let them 
stand to settle for twenty-four hours ; press off the 
juice, and to each quart add half a pound of an- 
chovies, and tlie like quantity of peeled and sliced 
eshallots, and a quarter of a pint of the best wine vi- 
negar ; give them a simmer for half an hour, till the 
anchovies are melted, and then strain the liquor 
upon two ounces of soup-herb powder, half an 
ounce of bruised black pepper, the same quantity 
of flour of mustard, a quarter of an ounce of nut- 
meg grated, a drachm of Cayenne pepper, half a 
dozen bay leaves, and half a pint of port wine ; 
let all simmer together for fifteen or twenty 
minutes, and then run it through a flannel bag till 
it is fine. 

Walnut Catsup. (No. 438.) 

Take two hundred walnuts when quite tender, 
put them into a gallon of salt and w^ater for a 
week : drain and dry them, mash them to a pulp 
in a marble mortar, with a pound of salt ; let it 
rest three or four days, and press all the juice 
from it ; to each gallon of liquor put a quarter of 
a pound of minced shallots, half an ounce of 
bruised cloves, same of mace and black pepper, 
one teaspoonful of Cayenne, and a quarter of a 
pound of salt ; give it a boil up, and strain it 
through a flannel bag. 

By adding a glass of brandy io each quart, it 
will keep much better.

MUSHROOM CATSUP, (No. 439.) 

When properly prepared, according to the fol- 
lowing directions, is the most delicious addition to 
made dishes, ragouts, soups, sauces or hashes. 
Mushroom gravy approaches the nature and 
flavour of meat gravy more than any vegetable 
juice, and is the best substitute for it in meagre 
soups, and extempore gravies, the chemistry of 
the kitchen has yet produced, to agreeably 
awaken the palate and encourage appetite. 

I believe the following is the best way of ex- 
tracting and preparing the essence of mushrooms, 
so as to procure and preserve all their fine flavour 
for a considerable length of time. Fine full grown 
flap mushrooms are to be preferred: put a layer 
of these at the bottom of a deep earthen pan, and 
sprinkle them with salt, then another layer of 
mushrooms, and some more salt on them, and so 
on alternately, salt and mushrooms ; let them 
remain two or three hours, by which time the 
salt will have penetrated into the mushrooms, and 
rendered them easy to break ; mash them well 
with your hands, and let (hem remain in salt for 
forty-eight hours, stirring them up and mashing 
them well each day; then pour them into a stone 
jar, and to each quart add a quarter of an ounce 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. 

of whole black pepper ; s(op the jar very close, 
and set it in a stewpan of boiling water, keeping 
it boiling for two hours. Take out the jar, and 
when the contents are cold, pour the juice clear 
from the settlings into a clean stewpan ; let it just 
boil up, skim it, and pour it into a clean dry jar 
or jug ; let it stand till next day, then pour it off 
as gently as possible, (so as not to disturb the 
settlings at the bottom of the jug,) through a taml 
mis, or thick flannel bag. Bottle it in pints or 
half pints ; (for it is best to keep it in such quanti- 
ties as are soon used :) in each pint put a dozen 
berries of black pepper, the same of allspice, and 
a tablespoonful of brandy *. Take especial care 
that it is closely corked and sealed down. If kept 
in a cool, dry place, it will be good for two years ; 
but if it is but badly corked, and kept in a damp 
place, it will soon spoil. Examine it every three 
months, and if any pellicle appears about the neck 
of the bottle, boil it up again with a few pepper^ 
corns. 

Obs. — You have here^^e Quintessence of mush- 
rooms^ and a tablespoonful of it Avill impregnate 
half a pint of sauce with the full flavour of them, 
in much greater perfection than can be obtained 
either from pickled or dried powder of mush- 
rooms. 



* We have added no more spice, &:c. than is absolutely neces- 
sary to feed the catsup, and keep it from fermenting. Brandy 
is an excellent preservative to all preparations of this sort, 
pickles, &c. &c. The less the natural flavour of the mush- 
rooms is overpowered the better, and we believe Brandy to 
deteriorate it so little, it can hardly be perceived by the finest 
palate. 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. 

What is sold for mushroom catsup, is generally 
an injudicious composition of so many different 
tastes, that the flavour of the mushroom is over- 
powered by a farrago of garlic, anchovy, mustard, 
shallot, beer, wine, spices, &c. 

Ready made catsup is little better than a de- 
coction of spice and water, with the grosser parts 
of the mushrooms all beaten up to a pulp. 

Excellent mushroom catsup may he had at But- 
ler's herb and seed shop, opposite Henrietta 
Street, Covent Garden, 

Mushrooms Presewed. (No. .440.) 

To every pint of mushrooms that remain after 
you have strained the liquor from them, as in the 
preceding receipt, add an ounce of salt, and a 
quarter of an ounce of ground black pepper ; stir 
well together, and put them into small jars for en- 
riching hashes, gravies, soups, or any brown made 
dishes, in which the flavour of the mushroom is 
agreeable. Close stopped they will keep tlie year 
round. 

Oyster Catsup. (No. 441.) 

Take fifty fine Milton oysters ; wash them in 
their own liquor, which must be boiled and well 
skimmed ; beard them, and pound the oysters in a 
marble mortar, and boil them in their liquor, with 
a pint and a half of white wine, for half an 
hour ; strain through muslin, and add the juice of 
a lemon, and half the peel, a drachm of mace^ 
nutmeg, and ginger grated ; boil for ten minutes 
longer, add half an ounce of shallots, and, when 
cold, bottle it with the shallots and spice in it. 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, ^X. 

Obs, — This composition very agreeably height- 
ens the flavour of all wliite sauces, and whi(e 
made dishes, and if you add a wine glass of 
brandy to each pint, it will keep good for a couple 
of years. 

Cockle and Muscle Catsup (No. 442.) 

May be made in the same way as the oyster 
catsup. 

Tomata Catsup, (No. 443.) 

Gather a gallon of fine, red, and full ripe 
tomatas ; mash them with one pound of salt ; let 
them rest for three days, press off the juice, and 
to each quart add a quarter of a pound of ancho- 
vies, two ounces of shallots, and an ounce of 
ground black pepper ; boil up together for half an 
hour, strain through a sieve, and put to it the 
following spices ; a quarter of an ounce of mace, 
the same of allspice and ginger, half an ounce of 
nutmeg, a drachm of coriander seed, and half a 
drachm of cochineal ; pound all together ; let 
them simmer gently for twenty minutes, and 
strain through a bag : when cold, bottle it, 
adding to each bottle a wineglass of brandy. It 
will keep for seven years. 

White Catsup. (No. 444.)

anchovies; let them simmer on a trivet by the 
side of the fire till they are dissolved, then strain

half a dozen bay leaves, an ounce of scraped 
horseradish, two drachms of grated nutmeg, one 
of bruised clov^es, the same ofwiiite pepper and 
ginger, and a dozen eshallots cut in quarters ; stop 
your jar very close ; keep it in a warm situation 
for ten days, shaking it up every day, and then 
decant it for use. 

Cucumber Catsup. (No. 445.) 

Peel and slice two dozen large cucumbers, add 
one third part of onions sliced, and throw a hand- 
ful of salt over them ; let them stand for a day 
and a half, occasionally stirring them up ; strain 
them through a hair sieve, and put to each quart 
of liquor a handful of scraped horseradish, the 
peel of a lemon, quarter of an ounce of black pep- 
per, two drachms of mace bruised; boil together 
for a quarter of an hour in a close covered vessel, 
and strain it : when cold, bottle it, and put to 
each pint a large tablespoonful of good brandy, 
to preserve it from fermentation, decomposi- 
tion, &c. 

Ohs. — Either of the preceding combinations 
will be found a very agreeable zest to most white 
dishes. 

Pudding Catsup. (No, 446.)

most delicious relish to puddings, and many 
sweet dishes. 

Potatoe Mucilage. (No. 448.) 

Peel and wash a pound of full grown potatoes, 
grate them on a bread grater into a deep dish 
containing half a gallon of clear water ; strain 
this through a hair sieve, and pour half a gallon 
more water through the sieve ; save the water, 
and leave it ten minutes to settle ; pour off the 
water, and fill up the dish again with fresh water, 
let it settle, and repeat this every ten minutes, as 
long as the water is stained reddish : you must 
change the water, and stir it up agairt* : you will 
at last find a fine white powder at the bottom of 
the vessel ; lay this on a sheet of paper in a hair 
sieve to dry, either in the sun, or before the fire, 
and it is ready for use. A large teaspoonful of 
this, mixed with a tablespoonful of cold water, 
will be sufficient to thicken a quart of gravy, into 
which it must be stirred just before you take it 
up, and will go as far as a tablespoonful of flour 
and butter. 

Obs This preparation requires some pa- 
tience and perseverance, and this is the great 
secret of making it : it is worth knowing, for it 
gives a richness and fine fulness on the palate to 
gravies and sauces at hardly any expense, which

may jiidge of its being completed, is by the purity of the 
water that comes from it after stirring it up,

peeled as thin as possible ; boil up slowly for \en 
minutes; pour it into a basin; when cold, take 
off the scum very clean, and bottle it for use.

cook must remember it will alter the flavour as 
well as colour of whatever it is added to.

let it stand five or six days by the fire : shake it 
■well every day, then tie it up as close as possible, 
and let it stand for three months. When you 
bottle it, put the pickle and lemon into a hair 
sieve, press them w ell, to get out the liquor ; let 
it stand till next d^y ; then pour off the fine and 
bottle it; let the rest stand three or four days and 
it Avill settle ; pour off the fine again, and let it 
again settle till you have poured off all you cam 
get fine. It may be put into any white sauce, and 
>v ill not hurt the colour; is very good for fish 
sauce and made dishes, especially of veal; a tea- 
spoonful is enough for "white, and two for brown 
sauce for a fowl : it is a most useful pickle, and, 
gives a pleasant flavour : be sure you put it in' 
before you thicken the sauce, or put any cream 
in, lest the sharpness make it curdle.

ery ^ London, 8vo. 1806. We suppose Mrs R's. 
praise of these two sauces to be well deserved, as 
they have been copied into almost every cookery 
book that has gone to press since. 

Hash Sauce. (No. 45 1 .) 

Mushroom catsup, three ounces. 
Eshallot wine, half an ounce. 
Walnut pickle, one ounce. 
Browning, one ounce. 
Mix. If you wish it to keep for a great length 
of time, add half an ounce of soup-herb spirit to it. 

Ohs. — This is not only a most convenient 
relish for hashes, but being composed of proper 
proportions of the ingredients usually employed 
to flavour and make sauce for hashes, it will save 
much time and trouble, and is thus easily made. 
Take a piece of butter about as big as a walnut, 
put it into a stewpan, and set it on the fire ; when 
it looks brown, put to it a tablespoonful of flour; 
stir it thoroughly together, aud add to it twelve 
berries of black pepper, and the same of allspice, 
a teaspoonful of soup-herb powder, and a teaspoon- 
ful of salt, and three tablespoonsful of hash sauce ; 
put to it a pint of boiling water, and let it boil 
gently over a slow fire for a quarter of an hour, 
then strain it through a sieve, and it is ready to re- 
ceive the meat that is to be warmed in it. 

Piquant e Vinegar, or Sauce for Salads -

Celery seed, half a drachm. 

Best white wine vineg-ar, a quart ; 
and half a pint poured hot over these ingredi- 
ents : it will be ready for use in about a fortnight. 

Salad Mixture, (No. 453.) 

Take white wine vinegar, one quart. 
Salt, two ounces. 
Boil them up together, and scum it well : then 
beat up the yolks of half a dozen eggs, strain 
through a sieve : add to these, 

Three tablespoonsful of made mustard, and 
Half a pint of olive oil, or oil of sweet al- 
monds. 
Mix this thoroughly together in a mortar, and 
put it to your vinegar in the stewpan ; set it over 
a very slow fire, and keep stirring it with a 
wooden spoon till it is simmered to the con- 
sistence of cream. When cold, bottle it, and cork 
it carefully. 

Curry Powder. (No. 454.) 

Take of the best Durham flour of mustard four 
ounces. 

Put the following ingredients in a cool oven all

Black pepper ground and sifted fine, half an 
ounce each. 

Ginger, 

Nutmeg grated, njid 

Salt, a quarter of an ounce each. 

Pvlace, two draciims. 

Cayenne pepper, one drachm. 

Pound ihem in a morlar, and pass them through 
a fine hair sieve : bottle them for use. The above 
articles will pound much easier and finer if they 
are dried first in a Dutch oven before a very gentle 
fire, at a good distance from it : if you give iheni 
much heat, all the finest fiavoar of them will be 
evaporated, and they will soon get a strong rank 
taste. 

Obs. — The spices in a ragout are indispens- 
able to give it a flavour, but not a p^redominant one ; 
their presence should be rather supposed than 
perceived; they are the invisible spirit of good 
cookery, and that happy mixture of them, and 
proportion to each other of the other ingredients 
which produces an exquisitely delicious, yet inde- 
finable flavour, is tJie *' c/ze/ffcewrre" of a first 
rate cook. But this grand art of mixing and com-

ObS' — This composition of tlie fine aromaiic 
herbs, is a most invaluable acquisition to (ho

as it impregnates sauce, soup, &c. with as much 
relish, and renders it equally agreeable to the

TO PRESERVE SWEET AND SA- 
VOURY HERBS. (No. 461.) 

For the following accurate and valuable infor- 
mation^ the reader is indebted to Mr. Butler, 
Herbalist and Seedsman, opposite Henrietta 
Street, Covent Garden Market, where the several 
articles may be obtained of the best quality, at 
the fair market price. 

It is very important to those who are not in the 
constant habit of attending the markets, io know 
when the various seasons commence for purchas- 
ing sweet herbs, &c., so necessary to be preserved 
when in the highest state of perfection : these are 
fullest of flavour just before they begin \o flower % 
the first and last crop have neither the fine flavour 
nor the perfume of those which are gathered in 
the height of the season ; that is, when the greater 
part of the crop of each species is ripe at the 
same period ; take care they are gathered on a

dry day, by which means they will have a bet- 
ter colour when dry. Cleanse your herbs well 
from dirt and dust, cut off the roots, separate the 
bunches into smaller ones, and hang them across 
11 line in the kitchen, where there is a moderate 
heat, which will dry them in an excellent manner : 
when perfectly dry, put them in bags, and lay 
them by on a shelf in the kitchen, they will keep 
good for twelve months, and be ready in the 
moment when wanted ; or rub them off the stalks 
and put them through a hair sieve, and put the 
powder into well stopped bottles : by this means 
their flavour is still better preserved. I would 
recommend parsley and fennel to be dried rather 
quicker than the other herbs, and rubbed clean 
from the stalks before they are bagged : these are 
not generally dried, but those who have experi- 
enced the goodness of them in this state, will not 
willingly omit preserving them. 

Basil is in the best state for drying from the 
middle of August, and three weeks after. 

Knotted Marjoram, from the beginning of 
July, and during the same.

PICKLES. (No. 462.) 

Commencini^ this list with walnuts, I must take 
this opportunity of impressing the necessity ot* 
being strictly particular in watching- the time, for 
of all the variety of articles required in this depart- 
ment, to furnish the well regulated store-room, 
nothing is so precarious, — for frequently after the 
first week that walnuts come in seasoii they be- 
come hard and shelled, particularly if the season 
is a very hot one, therefore let the prudent house- 
keeper consider it indispensably necessary they 
should be purchased as soon as they first appear 
at m.arket; should they cost a trifle more, that is 
nothing compared to the disappointment of find- 
ing six months hence, when you go to your pickle 
jar expecting a fine relish for your chops, &c., to 
find nuls incased in a shell, that defies both teeih 
and steel : I therefore recommend looking for them 
from the twelfth of July ; that being, i may say, 
the earliest possible time. 

Nasturhums are to be had by the middle of

Toast and JVater. (No. 463.*) 

Take a slice of a s(alc loaf, about tJic tbickness 
toast is usually cut; toast it carefully until it be 
complcteljj hrozDi^ed all over^ but not at all black- 
ened or burnt : put this in a jug, and pour upon 
it as mucli clean boilino^ water as you wish to 
make into drink, cover ihejug with a saucer or 
plate, and let it stand till it is quite cold : the 
fresher it is made the better, and more agreeable. 

Or, 

To make it more expeditiously, lay a slice of 
bread, a quarter of an inch thick, in a cheese- 
toaster before the fire, till it is brown through ; 
put it into a mug, and just cover it with boiling 
water ; let it stand till cold, then fill it up with cold 
spring water, and strain it through a fine sieve. 

OhS' — Tiie above will be found a pleasant, 
light, and excellent beverage at meals. 

Cool Tankard^ or Beer Cup. . (No. 464.) 

A quart of mild ale, two glasses of white wine, 
one glass of brandy, one of capillaire, the juice of 
a lemon, and nutmeg grated on the top, and a 
sprig of borrage* or balm. 

* " Borrage is one of the four cordial flowers ;" it comforts 
the heart, clieers melancholy, and revives the fainting spirits, 
says Salmon in the 45th page of his " Household Compa-

Punch, (No. 470.) 

The grand secret, or rather art, of making 
genuine l3ritish punch, consists in the preparation 
of a rich and delicate sherbets this being accom- 
plished, with the addition of the best Jamaica 
rum, or French brandy, and pure hot or cold 
water ; the mixture may be too strong or too 
weak, but cannot possibly prove bad punch. 

In preparing sherbet for punch, the acids of 
cream of tartar, tamarinds, and various other pre* 



SAUCES^ GRAVIES, Cs:c, 

pared vegetable acids, as well as that particularly 
denomiirited citric acid, are occasionally cm- 
ployed ; but, perhaps, after all, the juices of 
limes, leraonsj and Seville orang-es, expressed 
from the fresh fruits, when attainable, make the 
sort of sherbet which seems most congenial with 
the nature of good British punch. 

Procure a couple of ripe, sound, and fresh 
lemons, or limes, and a Seville orange ; rub off 
the yellow rind of one of the lemons with lumps of 
fine loaf sugar, putting each lump into the bowl 
as soon as it is saturated or clogged with the 
essence or grated rind ; then thinly pare the 
other lemon and Seville orange, and put these 
rinds also into the bowl, to which add plenty of 
sugar ; pour a very small quantity of boiling water, 
and immediately squeeze tlie juice of the fruit, fol- 
lowed by a little more hot water. Incorporate the 
whole well together with a punch ladle ; r:. ■ put- 
ting a little of the sherbet thus composec'L' <*y its 
richness and flavour by the palate. If the fruit be 
good, a practised punch maker will find little 
which requires to be regulated, and that little can 
soon be adjusted by supplying the aqueous, sac- 
charine, or acid deficiencies, so as to produce a 
luscious and rich bodied sherbet, fit for the re- 
ception of the sj3irit which is to give it animation. 
If straining should be found necessary, this is the 
period for using a lawn sieve, through which a 
little more hot water may afterwards be passed ; 
and a few parings of the orange or lemon rind are 
generally considered as having an agreeable ap- 
pearance floating in the bowl. The sherbet being 
thus prepared, to make it into genuine British 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. 

punch, spirit should be added iti the proportions 
of a bottle of (he best Jamaica rum to every pint 
of the finest Cogniac brandy : the entire strength 
or weakness may be suited to the general inclina- 
tion of the company for which it is prepared. 
The above quantity of fruit, with about three 
quarters of a pound of sugar, will make sufficient 
sherbet for three quarts of punch. 

Pine apple rum, and capillaire syrup instead of 
part of the sugar, may be used, if convenient, 
w'llh coiisider^'ble advantage to the flavour; 
tliough it will prove excellent punch without 
cither of these auxiliaries, or even Seville orange. 
The same sort of sherbet may, of course, be used 
for brandy punch, or rum punch singly ; but 
punch is seldom so made in England : most per- 
sons indeed mix equal parts of rum and brandy. 
-Arrack punch, however, is always made with that 
sp rit alone, and usually with a simp-e sherbet of 
lime or lemon juice, with sugar, as the flavour of 
the Seville orange interferes too much with the pe- 
culiar flavour of the arrack, which proves so grate- 
fid to most tastes, though to many very unpleasant. 
"When with the richest sherbet, sometimes render- 
ed still richer by fruit jellies, and even nutmeg, 
^vine is mingled with the rum and brandy instead 
of water, the liquor is called punch royal. 

The ndxture of a sm.all quaiitity of ale or porter, 
highly recom.inended by some in making punch, 
seems only advisable when it is rum punch, made 
"without any brandy, and must, even then, be 
very sparingly introduced. This article, what- 
ever may appear its value, is furnished;, with re- 
gard to its j>rinciples, by one of the first practical 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. 

punch makers in Europe ; who could easily, by 
dwellings: «'» minute circumstances, have supplied 
matter tor a small volume ; the essence of which 
is, however, he freely confesses, here sufficiently 
co.'iceatrat^d for every usefid purpose. 

With regard to the salubrity of punch, wheu 
drank in moderation, hot in winter, or cold, 
and even iced in summer, it affords a most grateful 
beverage; admirably allaying thirst, promoting 
the s(?cretions, and conveying animnliofi to the 
spirits. U\ however, amid the hilarity excited 
by the tempting iVagrance, and luscious taste, 
which the balmy bowl seldom fails to inspire, it 
be too freely and too h;ibitually drank, its power- 
ful combination of spirit and acid, instead of 
proving favourable to the constitution, will infalli- 
bly tend to bring on the gont, even sooner than 
most wines or strong cider, unless happily pre- 
vented by using a considerable deal of exercise. 
; Punch, like all the prime blessings of life, is 
excellent, and even salutary, when prudently en- 
joyed at proper seasons. We must not cliarge on 
them pur own want of discretion, by which alone 
they are ever converted to evils. 

The apparently whimsical English name of 
punch, like the liquor itself, is of West India 
origin, the word in the aboriginal language sig- 
nifying simply five, being the number of ingre- 
dients there used : viz. 1, acid, or lime, or lemon 
juice; 2, sweetness or sugar; 3, spirit or rum, 
&c. ; 4, water ; and 5, spicy flavour, or nutmeg, 
&c. It is singular, too, that punch, the word for 
five, consists of just five letters. 

From the opposite natures of the several ingre- 



SAUCES, GRAVIES, &C. 

dleiits, punch has also been sometimes called the 
liquor of contradictions.

cellent zcork, " The Family Receipt Book," Ato. London ."

Fine Red Ratijia. (No. 471.) 

Mash together in a tub or pan, three pounds of 
black cherries, two of ripe red gooseberries, and 
one of raspberries, or mulberries ; mix with these 
a quarter of an ounce of cinnamon, and twenty- 
four cherry kernels, previously well pounded in 
a mortar, with a pint of syrup : put all into a jar, 
stop it close, and keep it for \q\\ days in a heat of 
about ninety degrees of Fahrenheit's thermome- 
ter : then press it through a clean napkin, let ii 
stand twenty-four hours, and add to each quart of 
juice a pint of good brandy ; next day strain it 
through a flannel bag, that it may be quite clear,

sixth part of the white of an egg with a table- 
spoonful of cold water ; put it to the sugar before 
it gets warm, and stir it well together. VVatch it, 
and when it boils take off the scum ; and keep it 
boiling till no scum rises: when it is perfectly 
clear, run it through a silk sieve, or a clean napkin : 
put it into a close stopped bottle ; it will keep for 
months, and is an elegant article on the side- 
board for sweetenings.

in a pint of clarified syrup. Two tablespoonsful 
of this in a pint of water will immediately produce

A quart of brandy, diluted with the expressed 
filtered juice of two Seville oranges, and the peel 
of half a one steeped for three days, and half a 
pound of lump sugar then added to it, and then 
strained through flannel, produces this very 
palatable but seductive liquor, incomparably 
more tempting and insinuating than any of the

Under this general Lead we range our 
receipts for hashes, stews, fricasees, and ra- 
gouts * : of these there are a great multitujde, 
affording the ingenious cook an inexhaustible 
store of very rich and pleasing variety : we have 
very few general observations to make, after what 
we have already said in the chapter of gravies, 
sauces, soups, &c., which apply to the pre- 
sent chapter, as they form the principal part of 
the accompaniment of most of these dishes. We 
have given receipts for the most easy and simple 
way to make hashes, &c. ; for only those who are 
well skilled in culinary arts know how good 
things may be dressed up in this way, so as to be

as agreeable and nutritious as they were the first 
titne they were cooked ; the main hiisiness 
of 7)11/ book being to increase the comforts of 
moderate families and moderate fortunes. I 
have also given directions for preparing* the 
more composite and elaborate made dishes, still 
keeping constantly in mirjd, nol to make either 
(he stomach or the purse siitFer for the plea- 
sure of tiie palate ; endeavouring to hold the 
balance even, between the agreeable and the 
wholesome, and the epicure and the economist. 
This is by no means so difficult a task as some 
gloomy philosophers (uninitiated in culinary sci- 
ence,) have tried to make the world believe, 
whose leading doctrines are, that every thing that 
is nice must be noxious, and every thing that is 
nasty must be wholesome. But as Shakspeare 
could never find a philosopher who could endure 
Ihe tooth-ach patiently, so I have never met with 
a philosopher who did not love a feast. 

I promise those who do me the honour to put 
my receipts into practice, they will find that the 
most agreeable and truly elegant dislies are not 
always the most difficult to dress, the most expen- 
sive, or the most indiofcstible : be it known to all 
whom it may concern, that in these compositions

AVhilc we are contriving to give evevy gratifi- 
cation in tlic utmost perfection to the lover of 
good eating, we have not put any temptations in 
the Wciy of the valettidinarian that he may not 
occasiofially partake of, not only with impunity, 
but with advantage : the infirm stomachs of inva- 
lids sometimes require a little indulgence, and 
like other bad instruments want oiling, and screw- 
ing, and winding up, and adjusting with the 
utmost care, to keep them in tolerable order ; 
they will receive the most salutary stimulus from 
now and then making a full meal of a favourite 
dish. I believe this is not a singular notion of 
my own, (or a good word for my fellow spit-mates,) 
though it may not exactly agree with the present 
fastidious fancy of some of the faculty, that starva- 
tion is tlie sovereign remedy for all disorders. 
As abundance of eating and drinkirjg is perhaps 
one of the most frequent causes of the disorders 
of the rich, so privation is the common source of 
complaints among the poor ; and the cause of the

t Tlie following observations are extracted from Dr. 
*^ Reece's Gazette of Health:' 

All wines naturally possess a proportion of alcohol (ar- 
dent spirit) ; but to the foreign wines a quantity is added, to 
prevent their running into the acetous fermentation during 
the voyage to this country, and this is proportioned to 
the quality of the wine. In order, therefore, to ascertain the 
quantity which the different wines contain on an average, the 
experiments have been made on wines from different vendors. 
Brandy and rum are sold at different degrees of strength ; in- 
deed, some termed white brandy and white rum, are highly 
rectified. The brandy and rum employed in the following 
experiments were obtained from a respectable wine mer- 
chant, who was desired to send samples of the articles as 
generally sold to the public. 

A bottle of port wine, containing twenty-six ounces, which 
had been in bottle seven years, produced two ounces and 
seven drachms of alcohol (ardent spirit).

* " As to the quality of food, though whatever is easy of 
digestion, singly considered, deserves the preference; yet, 
regard must be had to the palate and appetite, because it is 
frequently found, that what the stomach earnestly covets, 
thougb of difficult digestion, does nevertheless digest better, 
than what is esteemed of easier digestion if the stomach 
nauseates it: I am of opinion the patient ought to eat only of 
one dish at a meal." Vide Sydenham's Treatise on Govt. 

" My appetite is in several things of itself happily enough 
accommodated to the health of my stomach : whatever I take 
against my liking does me harm; but nothing hurts me that

A Utile respect to the sug-gestions of iuslincf^ 
every invalid will find of iritinKe advantage : 
those Avho are poor in health, must live as tliey 
can : certainly the less stimuli any of us u^e, the 

sensation peculiar to the moutl), and diatijict from that of 
hunger or thirst. But, if we trace its origin, we shall be- 
convinced that this organ, which in the moutii makes us sen- 
sible of the fitness and delicacy of meats and drinks, is t!ie 
selfsame principle, that in the mouth, siullet, and stomach, is 
craving for food, and incites us to a longing after it. Tliese 
three parts, properly speaking, are but one continued organ,, 
and have but one and the same object. If the mouth cre- 
ates in us an aversion to any particular food, does not the 
gullet recoil at the approach of it ? and does not the slo-. 
mach immediately discharge its disagreeable contents?! 
Hunger, thirst, and taste, are therefore three effects of the 
same or^an. Hunger and thirst are the motions of the 
organ desirous of its object. The taste is the motion of 
the organ, in the enjoyment of this object. This unity of the 
organ, in regard of hunger, thirst, and taste, is the cause of 
these three effects biriiig almost always in the same propor- 
tion in the same persons. The more violent the appetite foe 
food is, the greater is the enjoyment in eating;, and the uiore 
the taste is gratified, the more easily the organs defr.iy the 
expense of this gratification, by digestion. This rule is gene- 
ral, in regard of all the sensations and all the passions. 
Genuine desire constitutes the proportion of the pleasure,, 
and of the power without this mutual consent, founded on the 
sympathy of these organs, our sensations would destroy that

circulation at the least expense of nervous and mus- 
cular irrifation, and afibrd the greatest porlion of

V. hen it demands restorative diet. 

Jf strong spices and savoury herbs awaken the 
appetite, they in an increased ratio accelerate the 
action of the bowels, and prematurely hurry the 
food through, the alimentary canal, too rapidly to 
allow the absorbents to do their work properly. 
We advise diose whose stomachs stand in need of 
such artificial stimulants, if they value either in- 
tensive or extensive life, rather to abstain from 
dishes requiring a vigorous stomach, than resort to 
such pernicious means of forcing the action of a 
feeble one : moreover, by the too frequent use of 
piquante sauces, &c., the papillary nerves of the

putably ihe best written book on the savoir vivre^ 
and which 1 had not met with till my own work was 
nearly ready to go to press. In the 5lh volume, 
pnge 195, speaking of the immoderate use of 
spices, &c. he says : '^ The stomach, the bowels, 
tlie liver, and the other viscera, soon become 
aflbcted with many unmanageable maladies, 
against which all the skill of Esculapius will 
avail nothing. Seek appetite, then, from air and 
exercise, rather than from the excessive use of 
exotic stimulants, especially the inflammatory 
spices, which arc burning as the sun which 
produces them; and however medicinal or ali- 
mentary they may be to the inliabitants of the 
tropics, to us are absolute poisons."

Hash Mutton. (No. 484.) 

Cut the meat you intend to hash into larj^e 
handsome slices, about a quarter of an inch thick, 
(not more,) lay them on a plate, ready ; make 
your sauce as receipt, No. S60; put in the meat, 
and let it simmer gently about twenty minutes; 
do not let it boil^ as that will make your meat 
grow tough aud hard*. 

To xvarm up Hashes, (No. 485.) 

Stews, ragouts, soups, &c. If you have any 
left, put it into a deep hash dish, or tureen : when 
you want it, set this in a stewpan of boiling water; 
let it stand till the contents are quite .hot ; it will 
eat as well as when first made. 



* All hashes and meats dressed a second time, should only 
simmer till just warm through : it is supposed they have beeii 
done very nearly, if not quite enough, already : thougii you 
will, of course, select those parts of the joint that have beeu 
least done. In Jnakingafiashfromalegofmutton, do not 
destroy the marrow-bone to help the gravy of your hash, to 
which it will make no perceptible addition; but'saw it in two, 
twist writing paper round the ends, and send it up- on a 
plate as aside dish, garnished with sprigs of parsley ; if it is 
a roast leg, preserve the end bone, and send it up betueen the 
marrozc bones. This is a very pretty luncheon or supper dish,

ounce of saKpetre, and a pound of saU ; let it lay 
four or live days, putting half a pint of water into 
the salting pan, that your jelly may not be too salt. 
Put all these into a jwt as nigh its size as possible ; 
cover it with water, and season it with a full sized 
carrot and a large onion, a sprig of sweet marjo- 
ram, three times the quantity of parsley, a dozeu 
corns of whole pepper, same of allspice ; take 
care to skim it well, and let it simmer very gently 
till it is quite tender, which it ought to be iu 
about four hours, lake the beef out, carefully 
strain the broth into a larger stewpan, and take 
the grease off it; set it on a quick fire, and let it 
boil away till it is reduced to a very strong jelly : 
beat the whites and shells of two eggs wiih a little 
cold water, and put them to the jelly : take it off 
the stove, let it settle for a few minutes ; but 
while it is hot, strain it through a very fine nap- 
kin ; with a paste brush rub a little of it over the 
meat; (this, iu culinary teclmicals, is termed 
glazing it ;) put the remainder of the jelly into a 
iJat dish about an inch deep : when it is tho-

In Ibc hundred and fifteen vo'unnes on cookeiy

we couhl not find one receij)t that approached any 
thing like to an accurate description of the way in 
whicli this excellent dish ss actually dress -d 
in the best alamode b ef shops ; from whence, 
of course, it was impossible to obtain any in- 
formation : however, after all, the whole of the 
secret seems to be the thickening the gravy (of 
beef that has been very slowly stevved) with bread 
raspings, and tlavouriFig it with bay leaves. 

Take about six pounds of the clod of beef, or 
the sticking piece ; cut it into pieces of two or 
three pounds each; put two ounces of beef drip- 
pings into a large deep stewpan ; as soon as it is 
quite hot, flour j^our meat, put it into the stew- 
pan, turn it often till it is a light brown, then 
cover it with boiling water, and put a quart over ; 
skim it when it boils, and then put in a largo 
onion, and half a pint of bread raspings, and let 
it stew very slowly for three hours, then just 
crack twelve berries of black pepper, same of 
allspice, and faur cloves, put them into a 
linen bag, with half a dozen bay leaves, and a 
bunch of sweet herbs, and let them stew an hour 
longer : if you find the meat suflicicntly tender, 
lake it up with a slice, cut it into quarter of a

then cover it with the skin and fat that jou cut off, 
and pour in half a pint of water; cover it close 
with white paper, and tie over that, strong brown 
paper, and set it in a slow oven for four hours ; 
"svhen it comes from the oven, pour the gravy from 
it into a basin, throw away the skins and fat, 
shred it fine, moisten it with the gravy you 
poured from the meat, and pound it in a marble 
mortar with a little clarified butter, or, what is 
better, some beef marrow, till it is as fine a paste as 
possible, seasoning it (by degrees as you are 
beating it,) with black pepper and allspice, or

2o viake an excellent hot dish of cold Veal. 
(No. 512.) 

Either a neck, loin, or fillet of veal will fur- 
nish an excellent ragout with very little expense 
or trouble. 

Cut your veal into handsome cutlets ; put a 
piece of butter or clean dripping into a fry- 
ingpan ; as soon as it is hot flour and fry your 
veal of a light brown ; take it out, and if you 
have no gravy ready, put a pint of boiling water

gradually add to it the gravy you made in the 
fryingpan ; let them simmer together for ten 
minutes till thoroughly incorporated ; season it 
with pepper, salt, and a little mace, and a wine 
glass of mushroom catsup ; strain it through a 
tammis to the meat : when the meat is thoroughly 
warmed it is enough.

thick, and add to the liquor an ounce of butter, 
and two teaspoonsful of flour : keep this over 
the fire, shaking it well till these ingredients are 
well mixed ; put in the sweetbread again, let it 
stew very gently till it is done enough, and the 
sauce is properly thickened, then beat up a 
couple of yolks of eggs with a glass of white wine ; 
add this to your sauce, stir it together, but do 
not let it boil. Garnish with slices of lemon.

Relishing Rashers of Bacon. (No. 527.) 

If you have any cold bacon in the larder, you 
may make a very nice dish of it by cutting it

Lay some slices of fine streaked bacon (not

if they wish it much or little done, i. e. curled

\A ell cleansed drippings, or lard, are better 
than butter to fry eggs. Be sure your fryingpan

three eggs iiito it ; do not turn them, but, while 
they arc frying, keep pouring some of the fat 
over them with a spoon : when the yolk just be-

To Poach Eggs, (No. 546.) 

You must have new laid, or very fresh eggs, 
or it is impossible to poach them nice : don't 
put any vinegar in the water, as it will harden 
the white of the egg, and quite spoil the look of 
it: the beauty ot' a poached egg is to have the 
yolk seen through the white. 

Take a flat open stevvpan half full of boiling 
water; you may put in two eggs at the same 
time, boil them gently for two minutes ; trim 
thejn, and send them up on a toast*, with or 
without butter ; or without a toast, garnished 
with streaked bacon nicely fried, s.lices of broiled 
beef or mutton, anchovies, or pork sausages. 

Obs. — The bread should be a little larger 
tlian the egg, and full a quarter of an inch thick : 
oniy just give it a fine yellow colour: take care 
not to toast it brown, or it will get a bitter flavour : 
if you do not butter it, it is usual to moisten it by 
pouring a little hot water on it, and some add a 
few drops of vinegar on it. 

To Boil Eggs in the Shell. (No. 547.) 

Put the eggs into boiling water; if you like the

pure bacon, are not bad for bre;ikfast, or to begin a meal,"

wish the yolk to be set, it will take three minutes 
and a half. 

Obs, — A new laid egg" will not require boiling 
so long as a stale one, by half a minute. 

Eggs Poached with Sauce of minced Ham. 
(No. 548.) 

Poach the eggs as before directed, and take 
two or three slices of boiled ham, n.ince it fifie, 
with a gherkin, a morsel of onion, a little parsley, 
and peppt^r and salt; stew all (ogcllier a quarter 
of an hour; serve up your sauce about haif boil- 
ing; put the eggs in a dish, squeeze over them 
the juice of half a Seville orange, or lemon, and 
pour the sauce over them. 

Fried Eggs and minced Bacon. (No. 549.) 

Choose some very fine bacon, streaked with a 
good deal of lean ; cut this into very thin slices, 
aV.d afterwards into the smallest square pieces ; 
throw them into a stewpan, and set it over a gentle 
fire, that they may lose some of their fat. When as 
much as will freely come is thus melted from them, 
lay them on a warm dish. Put into a stewpan a 
ladleful of melted bacon or lard ; sot it on a stove ; 
put in about a dozen of the small pieces of, the 
bacon, then stoop the stewpan and break in an 
egg. JSianage this carefully, and the egg will 
presently be done; it will be very round, and the 
little dice of bacon will stick to it all over, so 
that it will make a very pretty appearance. Take 
care the yolks do not harden ; and when the egg 



MADE DISHES. 

is thus done, lay it carefully on a warm disli, and 
do the others. 

%* They reckon 683 ways of dressing eggs in the French 
kitchen ; we hope we have here given sufficient "variety for 
English palates, in the half dozen preceding recei^s^ 



Egg Tea. (No. 550.) 

" The Jesuit that came from China, A. D. 1664, 

told Mr. Waller, that to a pint of tea they fre- , 

quently take the yolks of two new laid eggs, and j 

beat thera up with as much fine sugar as is suf- j 

ficient for the tea, and stir all well together. He j 

also informed him that the water must remain upon j 

the tea no longer than while you can say the ! 

*' Miserere" psalm very leisurely ; you have then ; 

only the spiritual part of the tea, the proportion | 

of which to the water must be about a drachm to a i 

pint." — Sir Kenelme Digby's Cookert/, London, ; 

1669, page 167. i 

Obs, — The addition of the egg makes the tea a ; 

more nutritious and substantial meal for a traveller. 

Suet Pudding, Wiggys fVay. (No. 551.) 1 

Suet, a quarter of a pound ; flour, three table- 
spoonsful; eggs, two, and a little grated ginger ; 
milk, half a pint. Mince the suet as fine as pos-| 
sible, roll it with the rolling pin so as to mix it; 
well with the flour; beat up the eggs, mix themj 
with the milk, and then mix all together ; wet yourj 
cloth well in boiling water, flour it, and tie it loose ij 
boil an hour and a quarter. i 



DADE DISHES. 

Yorkshire Pudding under Roast Meat. 
(No. 559..) 

This jiudding is an especially excellent accom- 
paniment to a sirloin of beef. 

Five tablespoonsful of flour, three eggs, a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and a pint and a half of milk: 
beat it up well, and take care it is not lumpy; 
put your dish under the meat, and let the drip- 
pings drop into it till it is quite hot and well 
greased; then pour in your baiter; when it is 
brown and set, then turn it, so as both sides 
may be brown alike: if it is to cut firm, it will 
take an hour and a half at a good fire. 

Plumb Pudding. (No. 55S.) 

Suet chopped fine, six ounces ; malaga raisins 
stoned, six ounces ; currants nicely washed and 
picked, eight ounces ; bread crumbs, three ounces ; 
flour, three ounces ; eggs, three ; the rind of half 
a lemon ; sixth of a nutmeg ; small blade of mace ; 
same quantity of cinnamon pounded as fine as pos- 
sible; half a teaspoonful of salt : half a pint of milk, or 
rather less; sugar, four ounces ; to which may be ad- 
ded, candied lemon, two ounces; citron, one ounce. 
Beat the eggs and spice well together, mix the milk 
with them by degrees, then the rest of the ingre- 
dients; dip a fine close linen cloth into boiling 
water, and put it in a hair sieve ; flour it a little, and 
tie it up close ; put it into a saucepan containing six 
quarts of boiling water ; keep a kettle of boiling 
water alongside of it, to fill up your pot as it wastes; 
be sure to keep it boiling six hours at least. 



MADE DISHES. 

Obs. — If the water ceases to boil, your pudding 
will become heavy, and be spoiled; but, if properly 
managed, this will be as fine a pudding of the kind 
as art can produce. This pudding is best when 
mixed over night, as the various ingredients by 
that means amalgamate^ and the whole becomes 
more rich and fuller of flavour. The stiffer it is 
mixed the better ; though the cook who consults 
her ease will not thank me for tiiis remark, if witb 
it she joins that which is indispensable, that the. 
various ingredients be THOROL'GHLY well beat 
together. A little brandy, say two tablespoonsful, 
is an improvement to this excellent BfiiTisn Pud- 
ding, which is truly a lirilisn dish, with roasted 
sirloin of beef, No. 19. See Padding Sauce, No. 
269, and Pudding Catsup, No. 446. 

Plumb Pudding, (No. 554.) 

Break four eggs into a basin, beat them very 
well, then put in by degrees four tablespoonsful of 
flour piled as high as the spoon will take ; beat the 
flour and the eggs together till the batter is quite 
smooth and light ; then add four even table- 
spoonsful of Lisbon sugar, and half a nutmeg 
grated, and a glass of brandy ; beat these in well, 
and then stir in a pound of suet cut very tine, or 
suet and marrow mixed, a pound of raisins stoned, 
some candied lemon or orange-peel sliced. Butter 
a basin well, and press the pudding close into it. 

Obs. — It must boil five hours. 

Pease Pudding. (No. 555.) 
Put a pint of split pease into a clean cloth ; do 



MADE DISHES. 

not tie tliem up too dose, but leave a little room for 
them to swell ; boil them slowly till they are tender; 
if they are good pease, they will be boiled enough 
in about three hours : take them up, and rub thera 
through a hair sieve; beat the pulp in a basin 
with an egg and an ounce of butter and some pep- 
per and salt; when the ingredients are well incor- 
porated together, (ie it up again in the cloth, and 
boil it half an hour longer. It is as good with 
boiled beef as it is with boiled pork. 

Cumber la7id Pudding. (No. 556) 

Beat four eggs well, mix them with a pint of milk 
and four ounces of lump sugar pounded and sifted ; 
raisins stoned, currants washed and picked, ap- 
ples chopped fine, of each four ounces; a little 
grated nutmeg, and a very little salt. 

Mix all well together : dip a pudding cloth in 
boiling water, wring it, and flour it ; put your 
pudding in, and boil it three hours and a half; 
send it up with pudding sauce in a boat : see re- 
ceipt, No. ^QS^ 

Maccarotii Pudding, (No. 557.) 

Boil a quarter of a pound of maccaroni till it is 
lender; then stew it in milk, with a little cinna- 
mon, and the rind of half a lemon : when it is 
perfectly well done, beat together the yolks of 
three eggs with the whites of two, and a glass of 
white wine, half a nutmeg, four bitter almonds, 
and sugar to your taste ; line the edge, and half 
way down the side of your pudding dish, with 



MADE DISHES, ScC. 

piiiT paste, put in the oven ; about half an hour 
will bake it. 

Rice Pudding. (No. 558.) 

AVash and pick half a pound of rice very clean ; 
T)bil it in a cloth till it is quite soft ; ihen. beat it 
in a marble mortar, with a quarter of a pound of 
butter, and the peel of a lemon ; add to it the 
juice of the lemon, or a glass of white wine, three 
e^gs, jolks and whites beat separately ; spice 
and sugar to your taste. An hour and twenty 
minutes will boil it. 

Ground Rice Pudding. (No. 559-) 

Put five tablespoon sful of ground rice into a 
stewpan with a pint and a half of cream or milk, 
four ounces of sugar, same of butter, and a table- 
spoonful of orange flour water: put on the fire, 
stir till it boils; let it simmer ten minutes in tbe^ 
corner of the stove; then break six eggs, mix the 
yolks in your pudding, and beat the whites till 
they are in snow ; mix all together, and put them 
in a dish, or mould, and put it in the oven ; it re- 
quires three quarters of an hour to bake it : do not 
take it out of the oven till it is called for. 

Custard Pudding, (No. 560.) 

' Boil a pint of milk ; put the peel of a kmoti 
into it, with a bit of cinnamon and three ounces 
of sugar ; when it has boiled, break six eggs, rub 
them through a silk sieve ; when the milk is a 
Httle cooled, mix it with your eggs, and strain it 
three or four times through the sieve ; then take 
a plain mould, put a piece of paper to the bottom 
just to cover it, that the pudding when done may 
Jiot stick to the. bottom, cover it with paper, and 



MADE DISHES, &C. 

put it in a stewpan wiih some boiling water ; as 
soon as it boils, put it in the corner of the stove 
that the water only simmer; it will lake 
about forty-five minutes : put your dish upon the 
top of the mould, and overset it in the dish. 

07'ange Pudding. (No. 561.) 

Grate the peel of three orani^es into a pint of 
milk, with three ounces of sugar and the crumb of 
a twopenny roll ; let it just boil, strain it through a 
tammis cloth, add four eggs, and the juice of 
four oranges : bake it thirty minutes. 

White Wine Whey (No. 56^:) 

Is made, by pouring equal parts of white wine 
and skimmed milk into a basin ; and after they 
have stood a few minutes, adding a double quan- 
tity of boiling water. In a short time the curd 
"will collect and subside at the bottom : the whey 
is now to be strained into another vessel, and 
sweetened with sugar : a sprig of balm, or a slice 
of lemon, will greatly improve its flavour. 

Ohs^ — This is a salubrious beverage taken im- 
mediately before retiring to bed, for those who 
have undergone severe bodily fatigue, or exposure 
to inclement weather, as it will excite a gentle 
perspiration, and thus obviate a cold or catarrh. 

Beef Tea. (No. 563.) 

Beef tea is usually made by cutting a pound of 
lean beef into very thin slices or shreds, and boil- 
ing it with two blades of mace in a quart of water. 
When the scum rises, carefully remove it while it 
continues boiling, for about a quarter of an hour. 

But on considering the effect of heat on the 



MADE DISHES, &C. 

volatile and spirituous parts of the animal fibre, 
when immersed in a fluid medium, we venture to 
suggest a more economical method of preparing 
beef tea. 

instead of boiling the meat, we would advise it 
to be minced fine, then to be reduced to a pulp 
with a wooden pestle, in an iron or marble mortar, 
and so express all its juice; strain it off, and add 
a little spice, and an equal or larger proportion of 
boiling water. 

Obs. — Thus the whole essence of the meat 
will be preserved, part of which would be vola- 
tilized by cooking. Nor does it admit of a doubt, 
that by such a mode of preparing it, half a pound 
of beef is nearly equal to a whole pound used ac- 
cording to the old method. 

J fine strengthening Mutton Broth, 
(No. 664.) . 

Two pounds of mutton or veal cwi small, a quar- 
ter pound of pearl barley, two quarts of water ; let 
it simmer slowly till it will rub through a hair 
sieve to the thickness of cream ; while preparing, 
take care to skim it well, and remove the fat 

Barley Water, (No. 565) 

Take a couple of ounces of pearl barley, wash 
it clean with cold water, and put it into half a 
pint of boiling water, and let it boil for five 
minutes; pour off this water, and add to it two 
quarts of boiling water : boil it to two pints, and 
strain it. 

The above is simple barley water ; to a quart 
of this is frequently added 

Two ounces of figs, sliced. 
R 2 



MADE DISHES, ScC* 

The same of raisins, stoned. 

Half an ounce of liquorice, sliced and bruised; 

And a pint of water. 

Boil till it is reduced to a quart, and strain. 

Obs — These drinks are intended to assuage 
thirst in ardent fevers and other inriammatorj dis- 
orders, where plenty of mild diluting liquor is 
one of the principal remedies ; and if not suggested 
by the medical attendant, frequently demanded 
by honest instinct, in terms too plain io be mis- 
understood : as the stomach sympathizes with 
every fibre of (he human frame, no part of it can 
be distressed, without in some degree oftending 
the stomach ; therefore it is of the utmost import- 
ance to soothe this grand organ, by rendering 
every thing we offer to it as elegant and agreeable 
as the nature of the case will admit of: the barley 
drink prepared according to the second receipt, 
will be received wiUi pleasure by iJie mobt deli- 
cate palate. 

Sanative English Tea. (No. 566.) 

Agrimony, and ground ivy, equal quantities ; 
and halftis much of the following; sweet marjo- 
ram, pennyroyal, lavender, rose, and cowslip 
ilower leaves. 

Chop and mix them together, and use them as 
India tea. 

TooiJiach and Anti rJieumatic Embrocation, 
(No. 567.) 

Sal volatile, three parts. 

Laudanum, one part. 

Mix, and rub (he pait adectcd frequently. 



Sec, 

Peiiistaltic Persuaders. (No. 5^8.) 

To humour (hat desire for the marvellous 
tvhich is so universal in medical matters, the 
contrivers of aperient pills have too often selected 
the most drastic purgatives, ^vhich operating con- 
siderably in a dose of a few grains, excite m.uch 
admiration in the patient, and great faith in their 
powers, in proportion as a small dose produces 
great effects, not considering how extremely irri- 
tating such materials must be, and consequently 
how iiijurious to a stomach already in a state of 
debility, and perhaps deranged by yesterday's 
excess *. 

The inventor of the '' Peristaltic Persuaders," 
gave them (hat name from the peculiar mildness 
of (heir operation : one or two of these pills 
merely give a gentle hhit to that grand organ, the 
stomach, and the other principal viscera, helping 
them to do their work a little faster, and remove 
>vhat is offensive into the bowels, accelerating (he 
process of diges(ion, and almost impercejDtibly 
augmenting tiie alvine exoneration: if a more 
speedy and copious evacuation is desired, take 
three, or four, or live, according to circumstances. 

%* These pills are prepared frwn a prescription of Dr. Kitch- 
i^er's^ and sold by G. D. Midclev, IS^o. 49, Strand, near 
the Adelphij in boxes, 2s. 9d. each. 

Stomachic Tinctui^e. (No. 569-) 

Cascarilla bark bruised, one ounce* 
Orange-peel dried, one ounce. 
Brandy, or proof spirit, one pint. 

* If the body or mind be fatigued, the stomach invariably 
sympathizes; and the most robust find, when tiiey do any 
thing too much, the stomach acts retrograde, and does too 
little. 



MADE DISHES, &C. 

Let the ingredients steep for a fortnight, and 
decant the clear liquor. 

Dose, two or three teaspoonsful in a wine- 
glass of water tw ice a day. 

Obs. — This is a most agreeable aromatic tonic 
to create appetite and promote digestion ; and 
when the stomach is in a state of great debility, is 
generally much more acceptable to it than any of 
the simple or compound tinctures of the Peruvian 
bark, or other bitters, ^'^s the former recipe is 
excellent to remove indigestion, so is this a sove- 
reign remedy to strengthen the stomach, and 
prevent it ; and in most nervous and languid 
chronic complaints of that organ, will be taken 
with the greatest advantage. 

Paregoric Elixir. (No. 570.) 

A drachm of purified opium. 

A drachm of flowers of benjamin. 

A drachm of oil of anniseed. 

Camphor, two scruples. 

Steep all in a pint of brandy, or proof spirit : 
let it stand icn days, occasionally shaking it up. 
Strain. 

A teaspoonful in half a pint of water gruel, taken 
the last thing at night, is a most eft'ectual medi- 
cine to remove coughs and colds. 

It is also excellent for children who have the 
hooping cough, in doses of from five to twenty 
drops in a little water. 

Dr. Cullens Receipt to make JVater Gruel. 
(No. 571.) 
The following is the most agreeable manner of 
making water gruel. 



MADE DISHES, &C. 

One ounce of oatmeal is sufficient to make two 
quarts of water gruel. 

Put the oatmeal into three quarts of soft cold 
■water, and set it over the lire. It must be con- 
stantly stirred till it boils ; then let it boil till a 
third part of the water is boiled away; then pour 
it throujc^li a linen cloth into a bowl a little larger 
than sufficient to contain it. In this bowl leave it 
to cool ; when it will be found separated into two 
parts, one of them a mealy cloud or sediment, 
and the other a very thin and clear liquor. The lat- 
ter is to be carefully decanted, or poured off for use. 

To render this more agreeable by the addition 
of sugar, acids, or aromatics, or to impregnate it 
with medicinal substances, 1 leave to the judg- 
ment of the nurse or phj^sician. 

See Cullen's 3Iat, Med, vol. i. p. 288. edit. 
2 vols. 4to. Edinburgh, 1789. 

JVater Gruel immediately. (No. 572.) 

Mix well together, by degrees, two tablespoons- 
ful of oatmeal, and a teaspoonful of salt, with a 
quart of cold water; set it on the fire, and let it 
boil gently for fifteen or twenty minutes, occa- 
sionally stirring it to prevent the oatmeal burning 
at the bottom of the stewpan : skim it and strain it. 

Ohs, — An ounce of fresh butter, a tablespoon- 
ful of brandy, and a teaspoonful of powdered sugar 
may be added. 

In the " PVay to save Wealth,'' London, 1697, 
in the 8th page are directions how to live for two- 
pence a day : the author's observation on water 
gruel is, that it makes *' a noble and exhilarating 
meal."

Andiovij Toast. (Xo. 573.) 

Bone and wash the anchovies, and pound thcni 
in a mortar Trith a little fresh butter; rub theiu 
through a sieve, and spread them on a toast. 

Ohs. — You may add, wliile pounding tJie an- 
chovies, a little made mustard and curry powder, 
or a few grains of Cayenne, or a Ihtle njace or 
"Other spice. It may be made still more savoury, 
by frying the toast in clariticd butter. 

Devilled Biscuit (No. 57^^ 

Is the above composition spread on a biscuit 
•^^■arraed before tlie fire in a Dutch oven, witli a 
sufficient quantity of salt and savoury spice, or 
ze^t^ or curry powder, or cayenne pepper sprinkled 
over it. 

Ohs. — This 7ie plus ultra of high spiced re- 
lislies, frequently makes its appearance at the fag 
end of a tavern dinner, when the votaries of Bac- 
chus are determined to vie with each other in 
sacrificing to the jolly god, and to celebrate his 
festive rites, ^' con furore,'^ 

To warm Water xvithcut Fire. (No. 575.) 

There have been many contrivances to beat 
water, &c. immediately, by lamps variously ap- 
plied : the most expeditious and easy way is, to 
get a frame made to carry a common tin sauce- 
pan over a patent lamp ; this will make half a 
pint of water boil in five minutes, and is a most 
valuable acquisition to the sick room.

sources, sufficiently ample, without being unnecessarily difiuie, had Ion- 



^ J. uuiiioimu, If If unci winjup j.TCCtyj Uftll UOneSm 

beea a Desideratum in English Literature; and it was with a view of 
supplying this defect, that the present Work was undertaken. 

It will readily be admitted, a perfect acquaintance with the local 
History and internal Advantages of our Native Country, is one of the 
most useful, ornamental, and desirable branches of human Knowledee ; 
and there is not, perhaps, a Country in the World more generally inte- 
resting to the Scientific Observer, than that of Great Britain. 

In order to render this Work as perfect and useful as possible, cor- 
rect Maps, and accurate Itineraries, have been considered indispensably- 
necessary. — In treating of the Ancient Hiitonj of our Island, the most 
authentic accounts only have been detailed, avoiding mere speculation; 
and, in describing Mo7iuments of Antiquity, their present appearance, 
with the opinions of the learned upon their origin, have been deemed 
sufficient. — The Topographical Descriptions have been drawn from the 
best works upon the subject, from original materials, and from actual 
observation. No pains have been spared in producing authentic his- 
torical accounts of the Ancient and Present State of every part of the 
Country. The Name of every Eminent Native, will be found recorded 
with due respect, at the same time that the Work has not been much in- 
creased in size by Biographical Memoirs. — The Natural History of 
the British Islands has claimed particular attention, and details haA'C 
been entered into, as amply as the nature of the Work would allow. 
Great care has been taken with the Local Trade and Mannfactures of 
cver>- part of Great Britain ; and no opportunity has been omitted to 
point out favourable situations for the exercise of Industry, and the'be- 
neficial application of Capital. — And, the" Science o£ Agric?j,lture, which 
has been so considerably benefited by the Publication of the valuable 
" AGRICULTURAL REPORTS OF GREAT BRITAIN," under the 
auspices of the Board of Agriculture, will be found to have received that 
share of attention, which the importance of tl^e subject demands. 

The Plan of this Work has received particular approbation, from 
each County being divided into. Easy Jour nies; by which. means, Per- 
sons, either'riding, or on foot, have the opportunity of viewing many 
Beauties, which otlierwise might be missed.

BELVS BEAUTIFUL EDITION 

or THE 

13rtti0t) 
CONSTITUTIONAL CLASSICS, 

Complete in Forty-five Numbers, Price Is. 6d. each, 

FORMING SEVEN ELEGANT VOLU.IES, 

BEING A LIBRARY OF 
HISTORICAL AND CONSTITUTIONAL INFORMATION. 

This Edition is printed in an elegant Pocket Size, on a beautiful wme 
Paper, of a neio Fabric, hot-pressed, with a nevo and clear Type. Each 
Number contains Four Sheets of Letter-press, or 64 Pages; and, from 
its unexampled elegance and convenient size, has an advantage over every 
former Edition of the Worlcs comprised mthin this Classification. 

This Complete Edition of tie Constitutional Classics consists of the 
foUowiag Works : viz. 

I. 

^ngUtttJ, 

Complete in Twenty-eight Numbers. 
This aiitioa contains the pure text of Blackstone, as printed from the last 
Edition revised by himself; but the subsequent Statutes, as far as they vary the 
propositions in the text, are fully given in the Notes; and all other judicial de- 
terminations, -which alter or qualify the Author'* original sentiments, are cor- 
rectly pointed out, and referred to; so that this Edition is what the Author in- 
tended, a Book of Elements and Principles, and yet exhibiting the actual 
shape and body of the Law, brought down to, and exi^-ting at the present day, 
—The Notes, therefore, are upon the ?:ame plan as the Work itself; that is, 
not branching out into uanecesfiary detail, or dilating upon the technical prac- 
tice of the Courts, but embodying only the new Laws, principles, and judicial 
determinations, introduced and acknowledged by the Legislature, since the last 
edition. 

A copious Index, digested on an entirely new plan, is annexed, and gives it a 
decided superiority over all other Editions of Blaciistone, which are so esseatially 
defective in this material requisite of a Book of Study and Reference.-^A fine 
Portrait of Blackstone, with his Life, is prefixed to the first Number. 

IL 

JBt Holme on tHe (iSJngU^^ Constitution, 

Complete in Five Numbera-. 
This Work is acknowledged to be a most luminous and masterly arrangement of 
the principles of the BritisJi Constitution. — The Author, being a foreigner, had 
escape ' he contagion of party passions, and had no prejudice to indulge on any. 
side. 1\ . iher Whig nor Tory, Aristocrat nor Republican, he viewed the mighty 
fabric of our Government with impartial reverence, and delineated all its partg 
with sacred truth. 

The present is printed from his last corrected Edition; to which a few Notes 
are appended, bringing the history of the Constitution down to the present 
time — A fine Portrait of De Lolme, with his Lift, is preSzed to the Fii^t 
NumbCT.

©f LOCKE on GOVER"NMENT, which was the stone upon whicb was fotihded, 
reared, and established, the glorious Pi-evolution in 1688, all praise would be 
superfluous. It develope-, with the most masterly skill, the principles of all 
Governments, and the claims of Englishmen to a Free Constitution. It shows, 
that obedience to Civil Government is submission to the will of God; and that, 
by the Laws of England, Liberty, Public Prosperity, and Private Happiness, are 
inseparably coanected. 

Complete in Five Numbers. 

Upon these celebrated Lettkrs, nothing in tlie nature of panegyric, needs be 
attempted. They are ceitainly not without con'^iderable virulence and asperity; 
but they contain the most solid principles of political wisdom and coustitutiooal 
}earning. This Work is net only worthy of being read for its profound and 
inanly exposition of the grounds of British liberty, but for the peculiar elegance, 
and polished poignancy of the style in whicb it is written.

Complete in Four Numbers. 
BURKE'S REFLECTIONS close this Series; — which appeared, when the con- 
\-ulsions of the French Revolution shook the Globe like an earthquake, and 
which, by the unrivalled charm of its reason and t.loquence, quenched the thirst 
for innovation, and allajed the rising storm, which threatened to tear us from 
our homes, our liberties, our altars, and our God. 

This has always been deemed a most valuable vindication of our rights and 
liberties; — upholding equally the Church and State, the prerogative of the 
Throne, the claims of the privileged orders, and the liberty of the subject. The 
Scholar should read it for its eloquence,— the Statesman for its wisdom,— aad 
all men for its virtue. 



The BRITISH CONSTITUTIONAL CLASSICS are particularly recom- 
mended to the Heads of Seminaries, and Families; by adopting which, the 
true interest, and the moral and intellectual improvement of the rising genera- 
tion might be most effectually promoted, and their minds formed to a love and 
reverence of the laws of their country, and a knowledge of its wise institutions. 

It is presumed, the portability 3.nA elegance of thig Series will render it pecu- 
liarly acceptable to the Sttcdents of oitr Universities ;— It is adapted t» 
the leisure of a morning or evening walk, or to the contemplation of the study. 
With the general reader, these Works must have their full influence and effect; 
—he cannot but be amply gratified in perusing these Classics, whose object is 
not to inculcate new fancies and opinions, but old and established truths, vene- 
rable for their age, and Facred for their utility, and to instruct every Englishman 
in thoFe Rights and Duties, upon which his Public and Private welfare depend, 
to cherish in him a generous Loyalty, a manly love of his own Liberties,— and a 
due value of the glorious Constitution under which he lives. 

Each Work may be had separatelif in boards, bound, or in Numbers.
