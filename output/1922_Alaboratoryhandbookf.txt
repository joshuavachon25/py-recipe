PREFACE TO THE FIRST EDITION. 

INVESTIGATIONS into the quantitative requirements of the 
human body have progressed so far as to make dietetics to a 
certain extent an exact science, and to emphasize the importance 
of a quantitative study of food materials. It is the purpose of 
this little book to explain the problems involved in the calcu- 
lation of food values and food requirements, and the construction 
of dietaries, and to furnish reference tables which will minimize 
the labor involved in such work without limiting dietary study 
to a few food materials. 

Only brief statements of the conditions affecting food require- 
ment have been made, the reader being referred to general text- 
books on the subject of nutrition for fuller information, but such 
data have been included as seem most useful in determining the 
amount of food for any normal individual under varying conditions 
of age and activity. 

Most of the available information in regard to food values is in 
terms of percentage composition, or of a single unit, as the 100- 
Calorie portion or the individual serving. The two latter are 
very useful, but too limited in scope and too inelastic in form 
to serve the needs of the general student. The first involves 
calculations which are always tedious and rob the student of time 
for a more comprehensive comparative study of food values. 
To lighten this labor, tables are included, giving the food values 
for the 100-Calorie Portion, which is taken as the Standard Portion 
in the sense that it serves as a convenient unit in building up a 
day's ration to yield a stated number of Calories; for the gram, 
which is the unit of weight for all scientific workers; for the ounce, 
the common unit of the small family group; and for the pound, the 
unit of the large family or institutional group. These tables have 
been in practical use for several years in the author's classes, 
and their value in relieving the student of monotonous clerical 
labor has been demonstrated. 

While it is desirable to encourage the use of labor-saving devices, 
the student of dietetics ought to know the processes involved

in dietary calculation, for these must be applied frequently in 
estimation of the food values of mixtures of food materials. Ex- 
perience has shown that every step must be explained in detail, 
and no apology is offered for the exceeding simplicity of some of the 
problems presented. 

Little attempt has been made to give measures corresponding to 
different weights of food materials, because this is properly a 
part of laboratory work in dietetics, and ample space has been 
provided for records of original observations. Such data must 
always be used with caution, for there is great diversity in the 
capacity of measuring vessels unless officially standardized, and 
much more in foods of different qualities, localities, and seasons. 

The author gratefully acknowledges the helpful criticism of 
Professor Henry C. Sherman in the preparation of this work. 



PREFACE TO THE SECOND EDITION. 

AMONG the recent advances in the science of nutrition, none is 
more notable than the recognition of three vitamines as essential 
to the continued well-being of mankind, both in childhood and 
in adult life. It is not yet possible to speak of these systematic- 
ally in quantitative terms, although much knowledge has already 
accumulated as to their occurrence in food materials, and it is 
possible to grade many foods as to the relative richness or poor- 
ness of their yield of the different vitamines. A table has been 
prepared which indicates roughly the vitamine content of a 
number of common food materials. This table is necessarily far 
from complete, but it represents fairly our present state of 
knowledge. 

Owing to the increasing interest in the nutrition of children, 
the section furnishing data for the estimation of their energy re- 
quirements has been extended, both in the direction of more 
material on weight and height relationships and of tables of 
energy requirements for different ages. 

The tables on energy requirements of adults have been ampli- 
fied and, it is hoped, put into more convenient form for practical 
use. \y 

Dietary standards for calcium, iron, and phosphorus have 
been somewhat modified by recent experimental work, and the 
revised data have been tabulated with the idea of facilitating 
their use. The tables giving the ash content of food materials 
have been revised in accordance with the tables in the Second 
Edition of the Chemistry of Food and Nutrition, with the kind 
permission of the author, Professor Henry C. Sherman. 

An abridged method of dietary calculation, designed to reduce 
the labor where large quantities of food are involved, as in in- 
stitutions, has been described in detail. Thanks for permission 
to use this method are due to Dr. A. R. Rose. 

Several new reference tables, furnishing additional data on 
the composition of food materials and on the relation of weight

to measure in food, will, it is hoped, make this book still more 
useful than the first edition. 

The author wishes to thank Miss Grace MacLeod, Miss 
Harriet Barto, and Miss Margaret Sandels for their generous 
help in bringing this material up to date.

FOOD VALUES AND FOOD REQUIREMENT. 
THE COMPOSITION OF FOOD MATERIALS. 

THE nutritive value of any food material depends largely upon 
its chemical composition. Through food must be supplied all 
the elements which enter into the structure of the living body, 
which afford energy for its activities, and which so regulate the 
vital processes as to produce that harmonious interaction which 
means health. The chief elements which food must furnish are 
carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, sulphur, phosphorus, iron, 
sodium, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and chlorine. The body 
can use these elements only in the form of certain definite com- 
pounds; charcoal and diamonds are forms of carbon, but no one 
would take them for food. The most important combinations of 
elements or chemical groups available for the welfare of the body 
are shown in the following table:

partly in combination 
with carbohydrates, 
fats, proteins, and 
other organic com- 
pounds. 



Unidentified substances known as Vitamines. 



2 LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 

With the exception of water, which can be supplied independently 
of other substances in such quantities as may be necessary, the 
essential constituents of food are proteins, fats, carbohydrates, 
ash constituents, and vitamines. 

These six chemical groups, proteins, fats, carbohydrates, ash 
constituents, vitamines, and water afford all the materials es- 
sential to an adequate diet. 

In case of many food materials, there is more or less inedible 
material, such as the rind of fruits, the shells of nuts, bone, con- 
nective tissue, and sometimes fat in meat, which is discarded as 
refuse. It is customary for food analysts to report their findings 
on a food which contains refuse in two ways : 

1. As PURCHASED, the amount of material which is ordinarily 
rejected being included in the total weight on which the percentage 
of each constituent is calculated. 

2. EDIBLE PORTION, the refuse being entirely discarded before 
taking the weight on which the calculations are made. 

A single example will serve to make this clear. An average 
banana, weighing about five and one-half ounces, will lose on 
peeling nearly two ounces, or approximately thirty-five per cent 
of its original weight. The total weight of each of the foodstuffs 
in such a banana is as follows: 

Water, Protein, Fat, Carbohydrate, Ash, 

ounces ounces ounces ounces ounces 

2.69 0.04 0.02 0.79 0.03 

If these values are expressed in percentages of the original weight 
of the unpeeled fruit (5.5 ounces), the results are reported "As 
Purchased": 

Refuse,* Water, Protein, Fat, Carbohydrate, Ash, 

per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent 

35.0 48.9 0.8 0.4 14.3 0.6 

If they are expressed in terms of the peeled fruit (3.57 ounces) 
the results appear somewhat different, and are reported as " Edible 
Portion": 

Refuse, Water, Protein, Fat, Carbohydrate, Ash, 

per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent per cent 

75.4 1.1 0.6 22.1 0.8 

In which of the above ways food values shall be expressed is merely 
a matter of convenience, provided the amount of refuse is not far 

* The average per cent of refuse in a number of the more common food materials 
is shown in Table A.V. 



FOOD VALUES AND FOOD REQUIREMENTS. 3 

from the average. A greater degree of accuracy as to nutritive 
value is insured by first removing the inedible portion, and then 
basing calculations on the weight of edible substance, but it must 
be borne in mind that the refuse affects estimations of cost made 
in this way. Thus if three bananas are purchased for five cents, 
and are found to weigh one pound in their skins, the weight of 
edible material will be about ten ounces; at the rate of ten ounces 
for five cents, the cost per pound of edible material will be nearly 
eight cents. Knowing the percentage of refuse ; we can convert 
the weight of edible material into weight as purchased by the 
following proportion: 

Weight of edible portion : Per cent of edible portion : : x : 100. 
x = weight of material as purchased. 

Thus, in the case above, 
Weight of edible portion Per cent of edible portion 

10.4 ounces : 65 : : x : 100. 

x = 16 (ounces of material as purchased). 

WATER is present in all food materials, with the exception of a 
few pure fats, sugars and starches. The amount may be anywhere 
from two to ninety-five per cent, crackers averaging about seven 
per cent, bread about thirty-five per cent, most meats from sixty 
to seventy-five per cent, and fresh fruits and vegetables from 
seventy-five to ninety-five per cent. Since water can be added to 
the diet without cost, its presence or absence is most significant 
from the economic standpoint. A pound of fresh tomatoes and 
one of rolled oats can often be bought for the same price, but the 
tomatoes will contain fifteen ounces of water and one ounce of dry 
matter, whereas the oats will furnish fifteen ounces of dry matter 
and one ounce of water; in other words, the dry matter in the 
tomatoes in this case may cost eighty cents per pound, while that 
in rolled oats costs five and one-third cents per pound. 

PROTEIN is not determined directly, but is estimated from the 
amount of nitrogen which the given material contains. The 
average amount of nitrogen in protein is estimated as about sixteen 
per cent. If we assume that sixteen parts of nitrogen correspond 
to one hundred parts of protein, then for one part of nitrogen, 
there will be six and one-fourth parts of protein. Analyses made 



1 LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 

in this way report the crude protein as "N X 6.25." This method 
is not strictly accurate for two reasons; first, because the nitrogen 
present may not be altogether in the form of true proteins, but 
partly as simpler compounds of lower value; second, because 
individual proteins differ considerably in the per cent of nitrogen 
which they contain, some having as low as fifteen per cent, and a 
number having seventeen to eighteen per cent. Hence, to secure 
strict accuracy, different factors are needed for the different food 
materials; but inasmuch as calculations of food values made on 
average analyses are only approximately correct in any given case, 
the convenient factor 6.25 has been widely adopted, and is satis- 
factory if it be borne in mind that estimations of protein in food 
materials made in this way tend to indicate somewhat more pro- 
tein than is probably available to the body. For such reasons as 
these, it is customary in experimental work, to compare the intake 
and output of nitrogen rather than to try to express that in food 
in terms of protein. 

FAT is determined by extraction of the food material with ether, 
and hence is more accurately designated "ether extract." Besides 
true fat and fatty acids, this extract may contain other acids, 
waxes, coloring matter or other substances. Thus the amount 
of fat is exaggerated, especially in some food materials low in 
fat, such as fresh fruits and green vegetables, in which as much a 
fifty per cent of the ether extract may be substances other than 
fat. In cases where the amount of fat is relatively greater, errors 
due to this cause are practically negligible. 

CARBOHYDRATES, as ordinarily reported, are estimated "by 
difference," that is, by subtracting the sum of the percentages of 
protein, fat, ash and water from one hundred. Here again, the 
results are only approximately accurate, partly because all the 
errors in the other estimations are charged against the carbo- 
hydrates, and partly because carbohydrates maj r be included which 
are not available for food, as woody fiber and certain gums. 

ASH is obtained by burning off all the combustible substances 
and weighing the residue. It is chiefly significant in showing what 
proportion of a dry foodstuff is not available for fuel ; consequently 
reports of total ash are not very important in dietary calculation. 
The nature of the mineral matter is, however, a matter of con- 
siderable importance, and while it is not necessary to calculate 



FOOD VALUES AND FOOD REQUIREMENTS. 5 

the total amount of every one of the different mineral constituents 
in every dietary, familiarity with their distribution in food ma- 
terials should be acquired by frequent reference to such data as in 
Tables XXVI and XXVII. 

VITAMINES exist in very small quantities in food materials and 
their exact chemical composition is not yet known; they can, how- 
ever, be extracted from the materials in which they occur by suit- 
able chemical methods. The kind and the amount of any vitamine 
in a given food material are at present most satisfactorily deter- 
mined by experiments in feeding animals. When any one of tho 
vitamines is withheld from the diet there is a loss of health with 
characteristic symptoms of the deficiency disease associated with 
such absence, and in case of two of the three known vitamines there 
is in the young animal interference with normal growth. By start- 
ing with a diet known to be lacking in just one vitamine, and adding 
to this different amounts of a food containing the lacking dietary 
essential, it is possible to find out just how much is needed to main- 
tain a normal rate of growth. For example; a diet of casein, starch, 
butter fat, and suitable mineral elements, with water to drink, is 
adequate for a rat except for one vitamine. This lacking substance 
may be found in the tomato, and addition to the diet of half a 
gram of dried tomato per day will result in normal growth. When 
such information has been secured, the way is open for comparative 
studies of the amounts present in food materials. The same vita- 
mine which served in the experiment just outlined is present in the 
carrot, one gram of suitably dried carrot serving to promote growth 
as well as one-half a gram of dried tomato. It is evident that one 
would draw from such an experiment the conclusion that the dried 
tomato is twice as rich as the carrot in this particular vitamine. 

At the present time we recognize three vitamines, known by 
various names, (1) The " A " Vitamine (Fat-soluble A) sometimes 
called the Antixerophthalmic Vitamine; (2) The "B" Vitamine 
(Water-soluble B) or the Antineuritic Vitamine; (3) The " C " 
Vitamine (Water-soluble C) or the Antiscorbutic Vitamine. 

THE FUNCTIONS OF FOOD. 

The human body is a working machine, for which the fuel is 
food; it is an aggregation of living cells in which chemical changes 
are continually occurring, old material being thrown out to be re- 
placed by new, which must be obtained from food ; it is an organism 



6 LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 

capable of building itself up from a single cell by conversion of food 
into body substance. It cannot, however, perform these func- 
tions without the proper balance of chemical compounds in all its 
tissues and fluids, and these compounds must be derived from a 
well-balanced diet. It may be said, therefore, that food has three 
important functions; namely, to supply energy; to build body 
substance; and to regulate body processes. 

FOOD AS A SOURCE OF ENERGY. 

Proteins, fats and carbohydrates have the great common func- 
tion of supplying the body with energy, which is the power to do 
work. This power is manifested in various ways, such as motion, 
heat, light, chemical or electrical activity. Our bodies are energy- 
transformers; their sole source of energy is food, and the most im- 
portant result of the changes which foods undergo in the body is 
the evolution of energy in the form of work or heat. The work 
may be internal, as that of digestion, respiration, circulation, and 
muscular tension; or external, as in walking, running, or other 
muscular activity; the heat is chiefly a by-product of these various 
forms of work, but under certain circumstances, when heat loss 
is very rapid, energy may be converted into this form, to maintain 
the normal body temperature. 

Since energy is easily transformed into heat, and this form is 
readily measured, a heat unit, the Calorie, has been adopted as 
the most convenient measure of energy. One Calorie is the amount 
of heat required to raise one kilogram (2.2 pounds) of water one 
degree Centigrade, or one pound of water four degrees Fahren- 
heit. Expressed in terms of work, it represents that required 
to lift one pound through the distance of 3087 feet, or 3087 foot- 
pounds. 

The total energy value of each of the fuel foodstuffs (proteins, 
fats, and carbohydrates) has been determined by burning it in a 
calorimeter in pure oxygen, under such conditions that all the 
heat evolved is taken up by water surrounding the vessel in which 
the combustion occurs, and the increase in the temperature of the 
water measured by a delicate thermometer. In the body, com- 
bustion of protein is not quite so complete as in the calorimeter, 
and there are usually some losses due to failure of complete di- 
gestion of each kind of foodstuff, so that the available energy 
is somewhat less than the total energy value. In a healthy human 



FOOD VALUES AND FOOD REQUIREMENTS. 7 

being, on an ordinaiy mixed diet, the fuel value of each foodstuff 
is on the average as follows: * 

Protein, 4 Calories per gram, 
Fat, 9 Calories per gram, 
Carbohydrate, 4 Calories per gram. 

Knowing the percentage composition of any food material, it 
is possible by means of these factors to compute its probable 
yield of energy to the body, as illustrated in Problem III, page 60. 

FOOD AS BUILDING MATERIAL. 

During the period of growth, which extends over the first 
twenty-five years of life, the body increases in weight usually 
from fifteen to twenty times. The source of the new body sub- 
stance is food. In adult life, growth ceases, except in special 
cases, as when the body tissues have been depleted through disease 
or accident or where unusual exercise or pregnancy induces muscle 
formation; but in all living substance there is a constant loss of 
old material, to be replaced by new, small in amount, but essential 
to life. Hence there is never a time when building material can 
be dispensed with entirely, though it becomes less prominent 
after maturity. The foodstuffs which play a specific role in body 
building are the proteins and certain ash constituents, the most 
important being phosphorus, iron, and calcium. 

Protein supplies nitrogen, essential for the protoplasm of all 
active cells and especially for the making of muscle. It is also a 
source of sulphur for body protein. 

Phosphorus, like nitrogen, is essential to the development of 
every cell. It is also one of the chief elements giving rigidity to 
the bones. It occurs in chemical combination with protein and 
fat in milk and eggs, as simpler organic compounds in grains and 
legumes, and chiefly as inorganic salts in meat, fish, fruits, and 
green vegetables. While all kinds are useful, the organic forms, 
especially phospho-proteins and phospho-fats, seem to be used to 
the best advantage by the young. 

Iron is an essential element of the hemoglobin of the blood and 
of all cell nuclei. Oxidation and cell development are therefore 

* Most of the calculations of fuel value previously made are slightly higher than 
those in this book, owing to the use of Rubner's factors (protein 4.1, fat 9.3, car- 
bohydrate, 4.1) which are now known to allow too little for losses in digestion. 



8 LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 

dependent on its presence. Food iron is in the form of iron-pro- 
tein compounds, found especially in egg yolk, green vegetables, 
fruits, legumes and whole grains. 

Calcium as building material is found chiefly in the bones and 
teeth. It occurs in food in combination with protein, as in milk, or 
as inorganic salts in whole grains, legumes, fruits, and vegetables. 

FOOD IN THE REGULATION OF BODY PROCESSES. 

The chief constituents of food participating in the regulation of 
body processes are the ash constituents, vitamines, and water. 

The most important mineral elements besides phosphorus, iron, 
calcium, and sulphur are magnesium, potassium, sodium, iodine, 
and chlorine. Upon the presence of the salts formed by these 
elements depend the neutrality of the blood, the acidity or al- 
kalinity of the digestive juices, the solvent power and osmotic 
pressure of different body fluids, and the elasticity and irritability 
of nerve and muscle. They form such combinations as tend to 
protect the body against harmful substances when present and to 
aid in their elimination. 

Vitamines are essential to growth in the young and to good health 
in all. 

The "A" Vitamine (Fat-soluble A) is necessary for growth. 
Furthermore, animals deprived of it for some time develop a char- 
acteristic eye disease known as xerophthalmia in which the eyes 
become inflamed, swell shut, and finally go blind; hence it is some- 
times called the Antixerophthalmic Vitamine. Other signs of 
failing health are loss in weight and deterioration of the hairy coat. 
Human beings also develop xerophthalmia under certain dietary 
restrictions. These things lead us to believe that this vitamine is 
very essential to human health. It occurs in liberal amounts in 
such foods as egg yolk, milk, cream, butter, fish oils, and green 
leaves, though it is found in various animal and plant foods in 
small quantities. 

The "B " Vitamine (Water-soluble B) is needed for growth in con- 
siderable amounts. When it is absent from the diet, a disease results 
known as beri-beri in human subjects and polyneuritis in other 
animals. This vitamine, on account of its preventive and curative 
properties, is also known as the Antineuritic Vitamine. It occurs 
in egg yolk, milk, whole grains and many vegetables and fruits. 

The "C" Vitamine (Water-soluble C) is not so essential to 



FOOD VALUES AND FOOD REQUIREMENTS. 



9 



growth as the other two vitamines, but is equally important for 
health. Human beings deprived of it only a few weeks develop 
scurvy; accordingly this vitamine is known as the Antiscorbutic 
Vitamine. It is found in various fresh fruits and vegetables, es- 
pecially worthy of mention being oranges, lemons, tomatoes, and 
potatoes. It is readily affected by heat, by aging, by drying, and 
by alkalies; hence the desirability of avoiding possible deficiency 
through knowing which foods retain their antiscorbutic property 
best, or by having a variety of fresh foods in the diet. 

FOOD REQUIREMENT. 

THE ENERGY REQUIREMENT OF NORMAL ADULTS. 
The first requirement of the body is for energy to replace that 
lost in its constant internal work and more or less irregular and 
variable external work. The greater the amount of muscular work, 
the higher the energy requirement. By use of the following tables 
it is possible to determine with considerable accuracy the energy 
requirement of any adult.* Tables I and II give the average

In ascertaining height measure yourself in shoes; stand erect, and press measur- 
ing rod down against scalp. Weigh yourself in indoor clothing and shoes. If shoes 
have sensible heels, subtract one inch for height; if heels are "high, " subtract two 
inches. 

weight in proportion to height, for men and women of different 
ages, and Tables III, IV, and V afford data for calculating the 
energy requirement according to this weight. Thus a man weigh- 
ing 70 kilograms, at light exercise, will require 2450-2800 Calories 
according to Table III, or if we state his day's activity more 
definitely, assuming that he sleeps 7 hours, works at his desk 10 
hours, does light exercise equivalent to walking 7 hours, we may 
then calculate his requirement according to Table IV: 

Sleeping, 7 X 65 Calories= 455 Calories. 
Sitting, 10 X 100 Calories= 1000 Calories. 
Exercise, 7 X 170 Calories= 1190 Calories. 
Total for day, 2645 Calories. 

If the subject under consideration is an adult of normal physique 
but weighs more or less than 70 kilograms, the total energy re- 
quirement is calculated as proportional to weight. Thus for 
a person of 55 kilograms (man or woman), with the same degree 
of activity, the proportional energy requirement would be 2078 
Calories. In the strictest sense the smaller subject would prob- 
ably have a somewhat larger energy output per unit of weight, as 
metabolism is more nearly proportional to surface than to weight.

THE ENERGY REQUIREMENT OF CHILDREN. 

The energy requirement of children is higher in proportion to 
body weight than that of adults. In youth the metabolism is 
more intense and there is a great storage of fool materials in the 
body in the process of growth, as is evident from the fact that 
a baby doubles in weight in the first 180 days of life. The muscular 
activity of children is also frequently greater than that of adults, 
so that their food requirement may be increased further in this way. 

To calculate the energy requirement of any child, it is necessary 
to know the requirements per unit of weight at different stages 
of growth, i. e., different ages, and the weight of the normal child 
at corresponding periods. Such data will be found in Tables 
VI-XI. Thus a normal boy, five years old, 42 inches high, should 
weigh 41 pounds or 18.6 kilograms, and will require at least 80 
Calories per kilogram, making a total per day of 1488 Calories. 

Activity of Light Housework, Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society, 
Vol. 58 (1919), pp. 89-96. 

Langworthy and Barott, Energy Expenditure in Household Tasks, American 
Journal of Physiology, Vol. 52 (1920), pp. 400-408. 



FOOD VALUES AND POOD REQUIREMENTS. 13 

With more than moderate activity, as much as 90 Calories per 
kilogram may be required, a total of 1674 per day. 

If a child is below normal weight, he should not be^ed according 
to his present weight, but regarded as undernourished and treated 
as nearly as possible in harmony with what his weight ought to be. 
Standards for children should in general be considered as repre- 
senting the minimum rather than the maximum food requirement.

THE ENERGY REQUIREMENT OF THE AGED. 

In old age, the activity of the cells diminishes, decreasing the 
rate of metabolism and the amount of internal work. External 
work is usually less than in middle life, and the ability of the body 
to deal with an excess of food is lessened. For these reasons, the 
energy requirement per unit of weight gradually declines as old 
age comes on, usually after the 60th year, and sometimes earlier. 
While senility cannot be measured exactly in years, we may, for 
convenience, divide this period into three parts, (1) from 60 to 70; 
(2) from 70 to 80; (3) from 80 to the end of .life, as a basis for 
estimating food requirements. 

The energy requirement is most satisfactorily calculated by 
using one of the methods suggested for obtaining the energy 
requirement of an adult * when the weight of the individual is 
known and suitable allowance is made for lessened activity. 
After the requirement has been calculated as if for a middle aged 
person, a deduction should be made for the decreased metabolism 
according to the following table, adapted from suggestions by 
Von Noorden. 



* Cf. Tables I-V.

THE PROTEIN REQUIREMENT. 

The protein requirement cannot be stated with the same exact- 
ness as the energy requirement. We know that some proteins 
will support growth; others serve merely to maintain the body at 
constant weight, and still others will by themselves neither main 
tain nitrogen equilibrium nor support growth. It is necessary 
therefore to choose proteins with some care if we try to limit the 
amount very closely, especially in childhood when they are so 
important for growth; or to take food materials of many kinds, 
so that different types of protein are represented in the diet. 

The total amount of protein required is independent of the 
amount of muscular activity. In the adult it depends rather upon 
the amount of active tissue in the body. In the case of an adult 
man of ordinary physique weighing seventy kilograms, while the 
energy requirement may vary from 2400 to 4000 Calories according 
to occupation, a protein supply of about one gram per kilogram of 
body weight per day will be liberal. In the child the require- 
ment is much higher in proportion to weight, owing to the use 
of protein as building material, especially for the muscles. At the 
time of most rapid growth nature provides about two and one-half 
grams of protein per kilogram of body weight per day. This is 
about ten per cent of the fuel requirement per kilogram, and it 
will be observed that a man at moderately active work, taking one 
gram of protein per kilogram is also getting about ten per cent 
of his calories in the form of protein. In old age, when new body 
substance is not being built, the existing cells are less active and 
the body is less capable of disposing of an excess, so that less than 
one gram per kilogram of body weight is needed, we find that there 
is also a decreased demand for total fuel, affording again a paral- 
lelism between energy and protein requirement. It seems safe 
to say, therefore, that except at complete rest from ten to fifteen 
per cent of the total fuel in the form of protein is sufficient for any 
age when the energy requirement is fully met. 

When the protein in the diet is excessively high, it raises the 
metabolism without any beneficial and possibly with harmful 



FOOD VALUES AND FOOD REQUIREMENTS. 19 

effects. It is at least a wasteful excess, and should be avoided. 
On the other hand, while it is possible to satisfy the requirements 
for nitrogen with less than ten per cent of the fuel in the form of 
protein, such a supply does not afford much reserve for such emer- 
gencies as loss in digestion, or inability of the body to utilize to good 
advantage the type of protein supplied, and is usually inadvisable. 

THE FAT AND CARBOHYDRATE REQUIREMENT. 

Assuming that from ten to fifteen per cent of the total fuel is 
derived from protein in satisfying the nitrogen requirement of 
the body, the remainder of the daily supply will have to be pro- 
vided from carbohydrates and fats. The amount of fat which can 
be digested differs with the individual and the form in which it is 
taken, but the average man's maximum capacity for digestion of 
fat is about 200 grams per day, and he does not seem to maintain 
his best health with less than about 75 grams (2.5 ounces) of fat 
per day. Within these limits, much variation is possible. The 
amount of carbohydrates which can be taken to advantage de- 
pends largely upon the form, starch being capable of good di- 
gestion in amounts up to or even above 500 grams per day. The 
assimilation limit for sugar varies with the kind, but is lower than 
that for starch. 

Under certain circumstances carbohydrates have a greater 
protein-sparing power than fats, but unless more than one-half 
of the total calories of the day's ration be derived from fats the 
protein-sparing action of a fat calorie or a carbohydrate calorie 
is practically the same. In the ordinary diet of a healthy indi- 
vidual the carbohydrates tend to predominate, so that there is 
seldom necessity for estimating fat and carbohydrate separately; 
the relative proportions will be determined largely by questions of 
bulk, ease of digestion, and the need for the fat-soluble vitamine, 
which may be associated with the food fat. In special cases it is 
sometimes necessary to calculate each separately, as in diabetes 
where the foodstuffs may all have to be carefully measured. The 
tables of food values will make these calculations comparatively 
simple. 

THE ASH REQUIREMENT. 

In a diet selected from a wide range of food materials, or a more 
limited one containing some kind of fruit and some green vegetable 



20 



LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 



every day and having milk as a prominent constituent, the needs 
of the individual for body-building and body-regulating ash con- 
stituents will probably be satisfactorily met. The ash require- 
ment has now been determined for calcium and phosphorus 
with the same accuracy as the protein requirement. There is 
abundant evidence that attention must be paid to the mineral 
elements of the diet, some of which are as indispensable as protein 
even though needed in much smaller amounts. The ones which 
it seems most unwise to leave to chance are phosphorus, iron, and 
calcium, diets which supply protein and fuel in adequate amounts 
not necessarily carrying a sufficiency of all of these. Generally 
diets having enough calcium and iron will also supply sufficient 
phosphorus. The quantities per day believed to be desirable in 
feeding a family are as follows:

As the calculation of the ash constituents is laborious, it is often 
simpler to see that the foods rich in these elements are abundantly 
represented, i. e., milk, eggs, whole grains, peas, beans, green vege- 
tables, and fruit, any excess of ash not being likely to do harm. 

When for any reason there is scarcity of the above foods, or a 
diet especially rich in any particular ash constituent is desired, 
the quantitative estimations of the various elements should be 
made by means of Tables XXVI and XXVII. 



FOOD VALUES AND FOOD REQUIREMENTS. 21 

THE VITAMINE REQUIREMENT. 

The necessity for at least three different vitamines in the diet 
has been demonstrated by experimental work with animals. It 
has also been confirmed for human beings by the cure of beri-beri, 
a disease due to lack of the "B" vitamine (Water-soluble B or the 
antineuritic vitamine) ; by the cure of scurvy, a disease due to lack 
of the "C" vitamine (Water-soluble C or the antiscorbutic vita- 
mine); and apparently by the cure of xerophthalmia, a disease 
produced experimentally in some animals by withholding from the 
diet the "A" vitamine (Fat-soluble A or the antixerophthalmic 
vitamine), and reported as cured in children subsisting on an in- 
adequate diet by adding to their ration foods rich in this vitamine, 
such as butter fat and chicken livers. 

Other evidence that health depends on a suitable amount of 
each of these vitamines is afforded by experiments showing ac- 
celerated rate of growth in infants when the amount of the "B" 
vitamine in their diet is increased, and general improvement in 
their physical condition through increase in the amount of the 
"C" vitamine when, though not having acute scurvy, they have 
been receiving too little of this dietary essential in their food. The 
suggestion has also been made that a lack of the " A" vitamine may 
be a contributing factor in the susceptibility of the poor and under- 
nourished to tuberculosis. 

There is, then, abundant evidence as to the need for certain 
amounts of these known vitamines, but scientific investigation 
has not yet gone far enough for any one to state definitely how 
much of each is required either for adults or children. On a diet 
which meets all other nutritive requirements and in which milk, 
vegetables, and some fresh food are a regular part of the menu 
there is little likelihood of deficiency in any of the vitamines. The 
"B" vitamine is so widely distributed in fruits and vegetables 
that a diet containing these in addition to milk will be adequate 
as regards this dietary factor. The "A" vitamine is also found in 
sufficient quantity in milk not deprived of its natural fat, in eggs, 
butter, and green leaves; wherefore the presence of these in the diet 
is a guarantee of safety so far as this vitamine is concerned. The 
"C" vitamine is more readily destroyed by heat, aging, and drying 
than the other vitamines, from which it follows that the best gen- 
eral protection against shortage is in a fairly regular supply of 



22

fresh food, and especially of fresh fruits and vegetables. Some 
information about the distribution of these vitamines in different 
foods may be secured from the following table:

PROBLEMS IN DIETARY CALCULATION. 
PROBLEM I. 

STUDIES IN WEIGHT, MEASURE AND COST OF SOME COMMON FOOD 

MATERIALS. 

In the following table (XV) are grouped those common food 
materials which are purchased and used by measure more fre- 
quently than by weight. The food values are given for all the 
customary units of weight : namely, the gram for scientific accuracy ; 
the ounce for the small family; and the pound for the larger in- 
stitution; the data being calculated, unless otherwise stated, from 
Bulletin 28, Office of Experiment Stations, U. S. Department of 
Agriculture, using the Atwater factors for energy values. Since 
estimates of food values made on average proximate analyses 
cannot be absolutely accurate, the number of digits in this table 
(and in Tables XXIII, XXIV, and XXV) has been limited to one 
or two decimal places except on the gram, where the food values 
serve also to indicate the percentage composition as given in the 
original report. These can be used in cases where the closest con- 
cordance in results is desired. 

For weighing the food materials, a Harvard Trip Scale with 
weights from one gram to one-half kilogram will be found most 
satisfactory, although any reliable household scale accurate to 
one-fourth ounce can be used. A number of standard or 100- 
Calorie portions of food materials representing the different classes 
of foodstuff should be weighed, carefully measured, and the result 
recorded in the blank space provided in the measure column of 
the tables. The total weight of the market unit, as the quart, can 
or package, should also be recorded in the blank space under the 
data on food values, and the cost of this and the 100-Calorie portion 
recorded in the cost column. Other useful data are the weight 
of one cupful or one tablespoonful, etc., of foods used by these 
measures in cookery, such as flour, sugar, butter, and milk. Com- 
parison of the cost of 100-Calorie portions will give a true idea of

TABLE XV. 

FOOD VALUES OF FOOD MATERIALS REQUIRING STUDY OP WEIGHTS AND MEASURES, AND 
OF COMPARATIVE COST ON THE BASIS OF FUEL VALUE. 

Calculated principally from Bulletin 28, Office of Experiment Stations, U. S. Department 
of Agriculture. 

A. P. denotes "as purchased." 

E. P. denotes "edible portion." 

S. P. denotes "standard" or "100-calorie" portion. 

The Per Cent of Refuse in common food materials is given in Table XVI. 

When it is impractical to weigh certain food materials some idea of the relation between 
weight and measure may be gained by reference to Tables XIX and XX, or to " Feeding 
the Family," Rose, New York, 1916.

PROBLEMS IN DIETARY CALCULATION. 59 

PROBLEM II. 

GIVEN THE PERCENTAGE COMPOSITION, TO FIND THE WEIGHT OF PROTEIN, 
FAT, AND CARBOHYDRATE RESPECTIVELY, IN ANY WEIGHT OF FOOD MATERIAL. 



In studying food values, it is necessary to be able to 
percentage quickly into terms of weight and vice versa. This is 
simple if it be clearly understood at the outset that percentage 
means parts per 100 parts, without regard to whether these parts 
be taken by English or Metric system. Cows' milk has the fol- 
lowing percentage composition: 

Protein Fat Carbohydrate 

3.3 per cent 4.0 per cent 5.0 per cent 

If we take as the basis for calculation a unit of weight, as one 
pound, we shall find the following weight of protein, fat and carbo- 
hydrate yielded by this amount of milk: 

Protein Fat Carbohydrate 

0.033 pound 0.04 pound 0.05 pound 

The scientific unit of weight is the gram, and the food-stuffs 
are commonly reported in terms of this unit. In one gram of 
milk there will be by weight, according to the above analysis: 

Protein Fat Carbohydrate 

0.033 gram 0.04 gram 0.05 gram 

Jn other words, dividing the figures representing the percentage 
composition by 100 (i. e., moving the decimal point two places 
toward the left) will give the weight in grams of protein, fat and 
carbohydrate in one gram of any food material. 

The number of grams of protein, fat or carbohydrate in one 
ounce of any food material may be found most easily by multiplying 
the values for one gram by 28.35, the number of grams in one 
ounce. Thus one ounce of milk yields: 

Protein Fat Carbohydrate 

0.9355 gram 1.134 grams 1.4175 grams 

(0.033X28.35) (.0.04 X 28.35) (0.05X28.35) 

The number of grams of protein, fat, or carbohydrate in one 
pound will be found by multiplying the values for one gram by 



60 LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 

453.6, the number of grams in one pound. Thus one pound ol 
milk yields: 

Protein Fat Carbohydrate 

14.9688 grams 18.144 grams 22.68 grams 

(0.033 X 453.6) (0.04 X 453.6) (0.05 X 453.6) 

In general, to find the weights of foodstuffs in any given amount 
of food material, find the weight of the material, express this in 
grams, and multiply the result by the food values for one gram. 
For example, to find the weight of each of the foodstuffs in quart 
of milk. 

First, ascertain the weight 34.4 ounces. 

Second, express this weight in grams 34.4 X 28.35 = 975.24 
grams. 

Third, multiply the weight in grams by the food values for one 
gram, as follows: 

Protein 975.24 X 0.033 = 32.183 grams. 

Fat '. 975.24 X 0.04 = 39.0096 grams. 

Carbohydrates 975.24 X 0.05 = 48.762 grams. 

In actual practice it is not necessary to retain all of these figures 
in the decimal fractions, which imply greater accuracy than is 
possible in estimating food values from average analyses of the 
food materials, as already stated in Problem I. The discrepancies 
which occur from dropping decimals are within the limits of ac- 
curacy in this method of determining food values. 



PROBLEM III. 
TO FIND THE FUEL VALUE OF ANY GIVEN WEIGHT OP FOOD MATERIAL. 

Since fuel values are expressed in terms of Calories per gram, 
one gram of protein yielding 4 Calories, one gram of fat 9 Calories, 
and one gram of carbohydrate 4 Calories, it is necessary to find 
first the amount of each nutrient in the given weight of food 
material LI grams, and then to multiply these results by the 
respective factors for fuel values, the sum of the products being 
the total fuel value. For example, one gram of milk yields 
0.033 gram of protein, 0.04 gram of fat and 0.05 gram of carbo 
hydrate (cf. Problem II). Then 



fltOBLEMS IN DIETARY CALCULATION. 61 

0.033 X 4 = 0.132 Calories from protein 

0.04 X 9 = 0.360 Calories from fat 

0.05 X 4 = 0.200 Calories from carbohydrate 

Total, 0.692 Calories, fuel value of one gram of milk. 

Similarly, the total fuel value for one quart of milk is obtained 
as follows: 

Weight of protein = 32.18 grams;* 32.18 X 4 = 129.72 Calories 

Weight of fat = 39.01 grams;* 39.01 X 9 = 351.09 Calories 

Weight of carbohydrate = 48.76 grams;* 48.76 X 4 = 195.04 Calories 

Total fuel value of one quart of milk = 675.85 Calories 

PROBLEM IV. 

TO FIND THE WEIGHT OF A STANDARD OR 100-CALORIE PORTION OF AN* 
SINGLE FOOD MATERIAL. 

In order to obtain an intelligent idea of the relative value of 
different kinds of food materials, it is necessary to establish some 
common unit on the basis of which they may be compared. With 
regard to fuel value, such a unit has been devised in the Standard 
Portion, which is the amount of any food capable of yielding in 
the body energy equivalent to 100 Calories. Every student of 
dietetics should oe familiar with the Standard Portions of all 
common food materials, and of the dishes which most frequently 
appear upon the table. 

To find the weight in grams of any Standard or 100-Calorie 
Portion: 

Determine the fuel value for one gram. 

Divide 100 by the fuel value per gram, or in other words, solve 
the folio wins: proportion: 

1 gram : Calories in one gram : x grams : 100 Calories. 

Thus in the case of cows' milk, the fuel value per gram is 0.692 
Calorie.f 

Then 100 -5- 0.692 = 144.5 grams; or, 

1 gram : 0.692 Calorie : : x : 100 Calories. 
0.692 x = 100 

x = 144.5 grams, weight of One Standard Portion of Milk 

Inasmuch as foods are purchased by English measure, it is 
necessary in estimating cost to express the Standard Portion in 

* Cf. Problem II. 

t Cf. Problem III. and Table XV. 



62 LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 

ounces (or sometimes in pounds). This can be done by dividing 
the number of grams by 28.35 (the number of grams in one ounce), 
but much time can be saved by using Table XXI for converting 
grams to ounces. By reference to this table, we find that 144.5 
grams equal 5.1 ounces. 

PROBLEM V. 
TO FIND THE FOOD VALUES FOR ANY COMBINATION OF FOOD MATERIALS. 

In ordinary dietetic practice, it is necessary to deal frequently 
with combinations of two or more food materials. Sugar is added 
to fruit, milk and butter to vegetables, and the products of cook 
book recipes are often quite complex mixtures. To ascertain the 
food values of such dishes it is necessary to proceed as follows: 

First, determine the weight of each ingredient in grams. 

Second, compute separately the protein, fct and carbohydrate 
in grams, and the fuel value for each food material. 

The sum of these will give the food values for the whole dish, 
as the following illustration will show: 

ONE EGG CAKE.* 

J cup of butter 2 cup of milk 

| cup of sugar l cups of flour 

1 egg 2| teaspoons of baking powder 

* Boston Cooking-School Cook Book. 

The butter weighs 57 grams; calculating the nutritive value 
according to Problems II and III (or referring to the food values 
of one gram in Table XV) we have the following results: 

Protein, Fat, Carbohydrate, Calorie* 

Grama Grams Grama 

0.57 48.45 438.3 

The other food materials are weighed and their food values 
calculated in similar fashion. The sum of the values for each 
food as tabulated below will give the value of the whole dish. 
The cost may be calculated for each ingredient and recorded at the 
same time.

J It is usually more satisfactory to take total weight and measure after the 
dish is cooked, so as to know the food value of a given amount of the finished 
product. 

PROBLEM VI. 

TO FIND THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE FOODSTUFFS IN A STANDARD PORTION 
OF A SINGLE FOOD MATERIAL. 

While the standard portion is of most convenience in estimating 
the total energy value of a given dietary, it may also serve as a 
means of indicating the amount of protein, fat or carbohydrate 
furnished, if we calculate the weight of each foodstuff in the 
standard portion itself. Having determined the weight of each 
nutrient in one gram of the food material (according to Probleu 
II), it is simply necessary to multiply these values by the weight 
of the standard portion in grams. Thus in the case of cows' milk, 

Protein, Gm. Fat, Gm. Carbohydrate, Cm- 
Weight of each food-stuff in one gram....0.033 0.04 0.05 

Weight of one Standard Portion 144.5 Gm. 

Total weight of each foodstuff in one 

Standard Portion 4.7685 5.780 7.225 

These results may be verified by multiplying the weight ol 
protein, fat and carbohydrate by the factors for fuel values (cf. 
Problem III) ; the sum of the products will be 100 Calories. 

Protein 4.7685 X4 = 19.074 Calories. 

Fat 5.780 X 9 = 52.02'J Calories. 

Carbohydrate 7.225 X 4 = 28.900 Calories. 

Total.... ....'. 99.994 Calories. 



It is often convenient to express the distribution of foodstuffi 



64 LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 

in a standard portion entirely in terms of energy value. From 
the calculations above it is evident that a standard portion of milk 
will yield, in round numbers, the following: 

Calories from Calories from Calories from Total 

Protein Fat Carbohydrate Calorie! 

19 62 29 100 

PROBLEM VII. 
TO FIND A STANDARD PORTION OF ANY COMBINATION OF FOOD MATERIALS. 

Standard portions of single food materials which are fairly 
constant in composition, may be permanently tabulated for refer- 
ence, but in the case of mixtures great variation in food value is 
possible, even in recipes containing only three or four different 
ingredients, and the comparison of Standard Portions of various 
dishes in which the food values are purposely modified (as by 
using skim milk for whole milk, half water and half milk instead 
of milk only) is most profitable. It is necessary, therefore, to 
be able to calculate the food values for a standard portion of any 
mixture of food material. 

The first step is to determine the total food values for the 
recipe, as described in Problem IV. 

Having ascertained the total fuel value, the per cent of the 
whole required to give 100 Calories is found by dividing 100 by 
the total number of Calories yielded by the recipe. Taking this 
per cent of the total weight, measure, food values, etc., of the 
recipe, will give the measure, weight and distribution of foodstuffs 
in the Standard Portion. 

For example, take the recipe for One Egg Cake in Problem V. 
The totals are as follows: 

Measure Weight Protein, Fat. Car bo- Calories Cost 

(Uncooked) (Uncooked). Grams Grams hydrate, 

Ounces Grams Grams 

8c. 18.7 628 30.76 56.83 239.95 1585.0 $0.1225 

Dividing 100 by 1585.6, gives 0.063, i.e., 6.3 per cent of the 
whole is required to yield 100 Calories. 

Multiplying the totals by 0.063, we have the value for one 
Standard Portion, as follows: 

Measure Weight Protein, Fat, Carbo- Calories Cost 

(Uncooked) (Uncooked). Grams Grama hydrate,

The total weight of the finished product is not the same as the 
combined weights of the ingredients in most cases, on account of 
changes in water content, but if the same proportion of the total

the individual portion. Such records are very useful in planning 
dietaries, saving time in calculation, especially if kept on uniform 
cards in a file. The foregoing shows a complete record on a con- 
venient model. 

PROBLEM VIII. 
TO FIND THE PERCENTAGE COMPOSITION OF A FOOD MIXTURE. 

Since the feeding of infants is commonly conducted according 
to the percentage method indicated in Problem IX, the ability 
to determine the percentage of each of the foodstuffs in any pre- 
scribed diet is as necessary as ability to modify milk according to 
a prescribed formula. 

Given, for instance, such a prescription as the following, what 
per cent of protein, fat, and carbohydrate does it contain? 

Whole milk, 16 ounces (by volume). 

Barley water, 16 ounces (containing 0.25 ounce of barley flour). 

Milk sugar. 1 ounce.

Having the total weight of the mixture, it is now a simple matter 
to determine what per cent of this is represented by each ingredient : 

Protein: 16.83 -f- 976.53 = 0.0172, or 1.72 per cent. 

Fat: 19.66 ^ 976.53 = 0.0201, or 2.01 per cent. 

Carbohydrate: 57.83 -f- 976.53 = 0.0592, or 6.92 per cent. 

PROBLEM IX. 
TO MAKE A COMPLETE DIETARY RECORD. 

The dietary may be considered from two points of view: first, 
as a record of food actually consumed by a given number of persons 
in a given period; second, as a prescription of the food to be pro- 
vided for certain individuals for a stated time. In either case, its 
value is increased by so arranging the report as to show not only 
the nutritive value of the diet, but also its cost and menu, thus 
presenting as clear a picture as possible of the food consumed, or a 
definite working plan for preparing the diet proposed. Since 
the data are frequently numerous, the work is much facilitated 
by suitable blanks, a convenient set consisting of six sheets, whose 
use is shown in the example of a complete dietary below. 

Sheet Number I gives general information with regard to the 
subjects of the study; it shows their individual requirements and 
affords a means of comparing one study with another by reducing 
both to a uniform basis, either "per capita" or "per man" per 
day. The tables in the section on Food Requirements (Tables I- 
XIII) will be of assistance in determining food requirements of 
individuals of different ages, weights and muscular activity. 

Sheet Number II is designed to give as accurately as possible 
a picture of how the food will appear upon the table. The amounts 



PROBLEMS IN DIETARY CALCULATION. 67 

should be stated for each dish in some way which will make the 
plan easy to follow in preparing the meals. Ordinarily, common 
measures (cups, tablespoons, etc.) will be most satisfactory, but 
in the laboratory it is frequently desirable that weights be stated, 
especially when several persons are engaged in preparing the 
day's ration, to avoid discrepancies due to inaccurate measurement. 
This careful statement of amounts serves also as a check against 
omitting in the computation of food values articles essential to 
the success of the menu. 

Sheet Number III indicates the total quantities of each kind 
of material required for the dietary, summarized from sheets 
IV and V, and the market prices upon which the actual cost of the 
food materials on Sheet IV is based, giving the market unit which 
it is necessary to purchase in order to obtain these prices. Thus 
it may serve to show the different results of buying in large and 
small quantities, if the net weight of the food materials is taken at 
the time of purchase. It also provides a useful check on the accu- 
racy of the calculations of the cost of small quantities. The state- 
ments as to the place and date of purchase afford criteria as to 
whether good judgment has been exercised in marketing, inasmuch 
as cost varies so greatly with locality and season. 

The special aim of this sheet is to furnish a convenient marketing 
list and to guard against attractive menus with that under- 
estimation of cost which tends to discredit dietary calculations 
as impractical, especially among those who do not realize how much 
can be accomplished by skillful choice and preparation of food 
materials. When the dietaries are to be prepared and the students 
do not buy the materials, Sheet III can be used to advantage as a 
requisition sheet. 

Sheet Number IV is the detailed statement of the protein, 
calories and cost of the whole dietary. Where cost is involved, it 
is usually easier to make the calculations on food materials as 
purchased; if the food values are for edible material this should 
be definitely stated. At the end, space is arranged for a summary 
and comparison with the standard proposed on the first sheet. 
Differences of not more than five per cent may be considered neg- 
ligible, but a slight excess is always better than a deficit, especially 
if no allowance is made for kitchen or table waste, which often 
amounts to ten per cent or more. 



68 LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 

Sheet Number V provides for a statement of food combinations 
used in the menu, and if the calculations on the original food 
materials are tabulated on Sheet IV nothing more than weights 
and measures of the different ingredients will be required. If the 
recipe is calculated in detail on this sheet, then only the totals 
need be copied on Sheet IV. When recipe cards are on file, they 
may be referred to by number. Without this sheet, it is difficult 
for any one but the persons who planned the dietary to know how 
the different dishes proposed are to be made, and often important 
ingredients are omitted entirely. 

Sheet No. VI provides for the calculation of calcium, iron 
and phosphorus in the dietary. Since a surplus of any or all of 
these elements is not usually disadvantageous so far as we know, 
it is more important to see whether the requirement is met 
than to determine the precise amount of each element present. 
This may be done by selecting from the dietary for calculation 
those foods which are the main sources of the element in ques- 
tion. If these supply enough to meet the requirement, calcula- 
lations on the remaining foods need not be made. If the foods 
selected for calculation do not yield enough, the work should 
be continued until the requirement has been met or the dietary 
has been shown to be actually deficient in the element under 
consideration. If the dietary should prove deficient, it should, 
of course, be revised to meet the standards set for the ash con- 
stituents. 

In the sample dietary sheet on page 74, this method of es- 
timating the ash constituents is well illustrated. Milk alone 
yields more than enough calcium and phosphorus to meet the 
standards set, and consequently calculations on other foods are 
not made for these elements; but the dietary is barely adequate 
in iron, hence it was necessary to continue calculation till every 
food used was included. 

At the present time it is not possible to set quantitative stand- 
ards for the vitamines. The best thing to do until research de- 
velops further is to see that some food or foods rich in each vita- 
mine is present. A list of vitamine containing foods in the 
illustrative dietary used here is appended to Dietary Sheet No. VI.

PROBLEM X. 
TO SCORE A DIETARY. 

In the laboratory it is frequently desirable to set out and compare 
two or more dietaries at the same time, and inasmuch as there 
are many factors to be taken into consideration besides supplying 
a specified amount of fuel at a given price, such as the adaptation 
of the diet to the locality, season, idiosyncrasies of the individual, 
availability of the food materials as prepared for the table, 
some of these factors often being overemphasized at the expense of 
others more important, it is believed that a dietary score card will 
help to give a clearer idea of the relative importance of the points 
which must generally be taken into consideration.

76 LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 

In judging the menus, the following general rules for the makirg 
of a menu should be borne in mind : 

1. Conceive of the whole day as the unit, rather than the indi- 
vidual meal. 

2. Endeavor to distribute the protein, fat and carbohydrate 
through the day, so that no meal will have a striking preponderance 
of one kind of foodstuff. 

For example, meat served with macaroni and cheese concentrates 
the protein in one meal, potatoes with rice concentrate the starch, 
and fried potatoes and pie concentrate the fat. 

3. With the exception of a few such staples as bread, butter and 
milk, try to avoid serving any food in the same form twice in the 
same day and serve it preferably only once in any form. 

4. Try to avoid serving any food which gives character to a dish 
twice in the same meal, even in different forms. Do not, for in- 
stance, select tomato soup and tomato salad for the same meal. 

5. At each meal, seek contrasts between successive courses, a 
bland course being followed by a more highly flavored course, 
and vice versa, to give a pleasing rhythm. 

6. In each course endeavor to have harmonious combinations, 
as to flavor, color, form and texture. 

7. As the number of courses increases, decrease the number 
of dishes and size of the servings in each. 

Distribution of credits to the sub-topics has been left to the 
judgment of the person using the score card. 



PROBLEMS IN DIETARY CALCULATION. 77 

PROBLEM XI. 

TO ABBREVIATE DIETARY CALCULATIONS WHEN LARGE QUANTITIES OF FOOD 

ARE INVOLVED.* . 

When dietary calculations are to be made on large quantities 
of food, as for example in an institution, the food consumed run- 
ning into hundreds or thousands of pounds, it is possible to apply 
some " short cuts" which materially lessen the labor involved, 
without introducing any great amount of error. The scheme pro- 
posed here is one of the most accurate of its kind, and has the ad- 
vantage of so grouping foods for calculation of total calories, pro- 
tein and fat calories (carbohydrate calories being easily determined 
by taking the difference between total calories and the sum of the 
protein and fat calories) that one can subsequently analyze the 
dietary quite readily as to its content of milk, of fruits and vege- 
tables, of meats, of cereals, of fats, or other items, to see whether 
these are so proportioned as to insure a liberal supply of ash con- 
stituents and vitamines, palatability without excessive cost, ease 
of digestion, laxative properties, etc. 

In this scheme all the food materials are listed by groups ac- 
cording to certain marked similarities in chemical constitution 
and these groups are gathered into seven classes, the resemblance 
in distribution of protein, fat, and carbohydrate being strong within 
each class. The seven classes are as follows: 

Class I. Cereals and cereal products. 

Class II. Dried legumes and shelled nuts. 

Class III. Vegetables and fruits. 

Class IV. Sugars, syrups, jams, candies, starches (foods yielding carbohydrates 

almost exclusively). 

Class V. Fats and oils (including separator cream and very fat meats) . 
Class VI. Milk (all kinds except skimmed), gravity cream, ice cream, chocolate, 

cocoa (foods with little carbohydrate but rich in both fat and protein). 
Class VII. Meats, eggs, cheese, skim milk (all animal foods not listed in Classes 

VorVI). 

Within each class, some staple food is taken as the "standard" 
or "type." Thus for Class I, Cereals and Cereal Products, wheat 
is designated as the type. Wheat and wheat products have fuel 
values per pound differing only a little from each other. These 
have been averaged (weighting the average to take acount of 
those occurring with greatest frequency, as wheat flour for ex- 
ample) and the averages are called the "type factors" for Class I. 
To use these, one adds together the original weights in pounds of 

* Adapted from "Abridged Dietary Calculations for Rations in Quantity," 
A. R. Rose, The Modern Hospital, Volume 14, Number 6, (1920). A still more 
abbreviated method may be found in the original paper. 



78 LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 

all the wheat products which have been used in the dietary, and 
multiplies this total weight once for all by the "type class factors," 
viz., for total calories, 1620; for protein calories, 210; for fat calo- 
ries, 40. 

Oatmeal has a slightly higher fuel value per pound than the 
wheat group, and ordinarily one would get the total calories per 
pound by multiplying the total number of pounds by 1800. But 
the labor will be lessened by altering the original weight of the 
oatmeal so that when this " adjusted" weight is multiplied by the 
same factor as is used for the wheat group the total calories yielded 
will be correct. This may be accomplished by multiplying the 
original weight of oatmeal by 1.1, adding its weight to the wheat 
group, and getting total calories for both in one operation. In 
other words, the weights of different kinds of food within a class 
are so adjusted either singly or in groups that they may be added 
together and one multiplication by the "type class factor" de- 
termine the total calories for the entire class. 

Similar adjustments are made to enable one to use a single 
factor for determining the protein calories of a class. Thus in 
the case of oatmeal the percentage of protein is considerably 
higher than the percentage average for the wheat group. But by 
increasing the weight 40 per cent the same factor can be used for 
both wheat and oatmeal. In like manner a weight-adjusting- 
factor can be applied to the determination of the fat calories. To 
carry out the method in detail a set of such weight-adjusting- 
factors must be at hand, and one which is the result of much care- 
ful study of the whole situation is given below.

With the above list as a guide, the various food materials com- 
posing the dietary are set down in their respective classes and 
groups, the weight of each being stated in pounds, and all the 
foods of a group being added together. Then the weight-adjusting 
factors are applied to these totals. For example, we have in our 
list 833.5 pounds of wheat flour and 91.7 pounds of cream of wheat; 
both of these, being cereal products, belong to Class I ; being wheat 
products they belong to Group I within the class and, since wheat 
is the "standard" from which all the weight-adjusting-factors are 
derived, the weight-adjusting-factors for this group are all unity. 
If, furthermore, we have 111.2 pounds of oatmeal, this also belongs 
to Class I, but to Group 4, and the adjustments are made thus:

111.2x1.4 =

111.2x7.0 =

When all "group" adjustments are made, the sum of the weights 
in each class, now adjusted for "total calories," are added together. 
This sum, multiplied by the proper "type class factor," (see table 



PROBLEMS IN DIETARY CALCULATION. 81 

below) gives the total calories for the class. Protein and fat 
calories are calculated in similar fashion,

A good idea of the labor saving in the use of the abbreviated 
method as compared with the usual one may be made by a survey 
of the figures for a single class of food materials (Class I), taken 
from an actual dietary. It is estimated that the accuracy is nearly 
as great in the second method as the first, unless large quantities 
of very unusual foods occur. These might best be calculated 
separately and added to their respective classes.

THE DISTRIBUTION OF CALORIES IN THE DIETARY. 

When the fuel values of the dietary have been calculated in 
this way it is a simple matter to study the distribution of the food 
through the seven classes into which it has been divided by de- 
termining the percentage of the total calories contributed by each 
class. The calories derived from cereals (Class I) may range 
from 25 to 50 per cent of the total calories, but it is doubtful if a 
diet having more than 45 per cent of its total calories derived from 
cereals will be adequate in mineral constituents and vitamines and 
sufficiently palatable. Again, it would seem desirable to have not 
less than 8 per cent of the total calories derived from milk, and 
not less than 15 per cent from vegetables and fruits. It is difficult 
to make more than 2 or 3 per cent of dried legumes acceptable; 
ordinarily nuts form so small an item in an institutional ration as 
to be practically negligible. In Class IV (sugars, jams, starches, 
etc.), the sweet foods are apt to exceed greatly the starches and 
it seems generally desirable that the calories of this group should 
not exceed 10 per cent of the total calories, as high figures here 
tend to low values for mineral constituents and vitamines. Exces- 
sively high fat is not very common in dietaries for large groups, 



84 LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 

but since food materials are calculated on the " As Purchased " 
basis, due regard must be had for the actual consumption of fat 
as compared with that purchased. Dietaries too high in fat will 
be difficult to digest, and those too low tend to be low in total fuel 
value and to lack palatability. It must also be borne in mind 
that some of the fat in the dietary occurs in the milk and meats, 
accounted for in other groups. It would seem desirable that the 
fat represented in this group should fall between the limits of 5 
and 10 per cent. Meats and other high protein foods, relatively 
less in need of emphasis than several of the other groups, may 
fluctuate within rather wide limits, depending in part on the money 
left after such foods as milk and vegetables are provided for, and 
in part on the proportion of protein derived from the rest of the 
dietary. In general, it would seem wise not to have the protein 
calories as a whole less than 10 or more than 15 per cent of the 
total calories.

APPENDIX. 

THE EQUIPMENT OF A DIETETICS LABORATORY. 

It is essential that laboratory practice with actual food materials 
accompany instruction in the quantitative aspects of dietetics, 
and it is advantageous even in considering the qualitative side 
to present a dietary in concrete form. A place must therefore 
be provided where weighing and measuring of food materials and 
cooking and serving of days' rations for individuals and groups 
can be done by a whole class. The ordinary cooking laboratory 
can be made to answer the purpose by a few additions to its 
ordinary equipment, but a room definitely planned for the special 
problems involved is more satisfactory, and it is hoped that the 
following description of a laboratory which has been found to meet 
these needs will be suggestive to others. 

The floor plan is shown in the accompanying drawing. The 
room is thirty-nine feet long and twenty-eight and one-half feet 
wide, and accommodates a class of thirty students. 

One side of the room is occupied by three cooking tables with 
sinks at each end. These tables have on each side five drawers and 
five cupboards for utensils, and three deeper drawers for supplies 
such as flour and sugar. On each table are conveniently arranged 
five two-burner school stoves, and six Harvard trip scales with 
brass weights from one gram to five hundred grams. The usual 
individual arrangement of utensils in the desks has not been 
followed, owing to the fact that many problems in dietetics involve 
group work, but the three tables are equipped in identical fashion, 
so that three groups may prepare at once three family dietaries 
without students of one group having to go to another table for 
utensils, thus saving time and avoiding confusion. In each utensil 
drawer are placed knives, forks, spoons, holders and brushes, 
towels being provided from a common rack. In each cupboard 
is a single kind of utensil (or a group of small articles), the contents 
being plainly indicated on the door. This arrangement not only 
makes the different articles easy of access but also easy to replace. 

The other side of the room is supplied with eight portable oak

146 LABORATORY HANDBOOK FOR DIETETICS. 

tables three by four and one-half feet, with a single large drawer in 
each for storing paper, charts, cook books and other reference 
material. These tables serve a double purpose, being used for 
writing in the lecture hour, or for calculations, to which much time 
must be given in spite of all devices to eliminate mere clerica) 
labor, and also affording space for the proper display of food 
materials, whether for the simple comparison of standard or 100- 
Calorie portions or for a critical study of days' rations for several 
families. The size of the tables makes the system very elastic. 
In setting out family dietaries one table will accommodate each 
meal for the group; by putting two together end to end, four 
individual days' dietaries can be set out parallel for comparison; 
two set side to side make a dining table of attractive shape for a 
meal to be eaten by a small group; or three side to side provide a 
large table of good proportions. For accommodating such a 
system doilies are more satisfactory than table cloths. Enough 
linen, silver, glass and china are provided that the whole class 
can be served in three groups to breakfast, luncheon and dinner 
at the same time, but no provision is made for elaborate service 
or fancy cookery. 

A large amount of blackboard space is highly desirable for the 
purpose of recording the results of laboratory experiments or 
writing the menus and other details of dietaries which are being 
displayed. In this laboratory a single long board is provided 
(see drawing). Besides the blackboard a large cork bulletin 
board behind the instructor's desk affords a place to post charts, 
dietaries and other data. 

The character of the equipment is shown in the following 
classified lists.
