PREFACE 

npHE recipes in this book have been carefully tested, 
-*- and if measurements and general instructions are 
followed, the result in every case will be satisfactory. 

The author has endeavored to give clear and con- 
cise instructions for the best dishes of their kind; rather 
than take up space for repetition of the same general 
recipe varied only in flavoring, form of baking and 
other minor detail. 

It will be noted in the table of weights and meas- 
ures that all measurements are given as Level. Ideas 
vary as to what constitutes a rounding or heaping 
spoon or cupful, while Level is or should be the same 
the world over — as much as spoon or cup will hold, 
then leveled off with a knife. 

Where butter is specified in a recipe, any pre- 
ferred butter substitute may be used, at the 
discretion of the worker. 

It is not claimed that these recipes are all new. Some 
are original; some the gift of friends who have experi- 
mented till good results were obtained; some are old 
family recipes, never before printed; while others are 
standard rules that have stood the test of years and 
are still at the head of their respective lists. However, 
all have been tested and may be used by the novice 
with the same certainty of success as when the in- 
gredients are combined by the experienced cook.

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 

1 cupful =3^ P mt - 

4 cupfuls =1 quart. 

3 teaspoonfuls liquid . . =1 tablespoonful. 

1 gill =3^ cupful.

4 tablespoonfuls ... =1 wineglassful. 
60 drops =1 teaspoonful. 

4 level tablespoonfuls flour = 1 ounce. 

One-half spoonful is measured lengthwise of the 
spoon. 

A set of measures (quart, pint and half-pint) should 
be in every kitchen. The graduated measures divided 
into quarters, halves and thirds are best. A graduated 
glass measure is also advisable for the correct measure- 
ment of liquids. 

A set of accurate scales is also indispensable to good 
cooking and housekeeping. 

In all bread, cake and pastry making, sift flour before 
measuring. Then measure and sift again with the salt, 
baking powder and any other ingredients which may be 
specified in the individual recipe.

THE VALUE OF PHOSPHATES IN FOOD 

THE leavening used in home baking has the power of 
making the food either nutritious and wholesome; or, 
what might be termed a food failure. 

Nature's laws of supply and demand require the constant 
presence of the phosphates in the human system. As these 
phosphates are consumed with every effort, so are they abso- 
lutely necessary to the health. They are contained in every 
tissue, nerve and muscle of the body. Physiologists teach 
us that with an abundant supply in the system, good health 
is the rule, and without that supply, disease is inevitable. 

As is well known, in the process of milling fine wheat flour, 
a material portion of the nutritious and health-giving phos- 
phates is eliminated, thus depriving the flour of much of its 
food value 

Many years ago the eminent Chemist, Prof. Horsford, 
then the Rumford Professor of Chemistry at Harvard Uni- 
versity, Cambridge, and a recognized authority on wheat 
and its conversion into bread, discovered after long scientific 
research, a method by which the equivalent of these neces- 
sary phosphates which the miller had removed could be re- 
stored to the flour and food through the medium of Rumford 
Baking Powder, a discovery which physiologists considered 
as one of the most useful gifts which science had made to 
mankind. 

The use of Rumford Baking Powder, which is the only 
baking powder in which Prof. Horsford's phosphate is used, 
not only makes the baking more wholesome and nutritious 
than when raised with cream of tartar or the ordinary alum 
baking powders, but it excels in efficiency and economy, pro-

SOUPS 

SOUP STOCK 

TO each quart of cold water allow one pound 
meat and bone in about equal proportions; one 
pint of cleaned vegetables, such as carrot, onion, 
celery, etc., cut in pieces; one bunch soup herbs, 
being a sprig of parsley, two bay leaves, and any 
dry herbs of which the flavor is desired, such as 
thyme, summer savory and marjoram; seasoning 
of salt and pepper to taste, together with a little 
celery seed or celery salt if fresh celery is not in 
season. 

Wipe the meat and cut into small pieces that it 
may more readily give off its juices; chop the bones 
and put them with the meat in the stock-pot; then 
add the vegetables and soup herbs. Pour the water, 
which must be cold,* over them and bring very slowly 
to the boiling point; skim if necessary and cook slowly 
for six hours, keeping the stock-pot closely covered. 
The stock must then be strained and left uncovered 
in a cool place till cold, that the fat may be more 
easily removed. The bones, meat and vegetables 
are sometimes cooked a second time with more water 
to make what is known as " second stock," not so 
strong as the first, but better than water for thick 
soups, sauces and gravies. 

If a highly flavored and colored stock is wanted, 
the vegetables and meat are sometimes browned in 
a little fat before the water is added, but this is not 
advisable where a clear stock is desired. Beef is the

meat most commonly used for brown stock, and 
veal or chicken with a little ham for white stock. 
Cooked meats and the trimmings from steaks and 
roasts may be added to the other ingredients in the 
stock-pot, but have not the same food value as fresh 
meats. 

Stock should never be left to cool in the stock-pot, 
but always removed to a clean, cold vessel and left 
uncovered in a cool place till wanted for use. 

All marrow should be removed from the bones 
before cooking. It can be used to better advantage 
in other ways. 

For family use where fair sized joints are frequent, 
it should be rarely necessary to buy meat for soups, 
the bones and trimmings furnishing enough, with a 
judicious use of vegetables and flavorings, for ordi- 
nary use. The same rules, previously given, apply 
to the making of stock under these conditions if a 
little less water in proportion to the meat is used. 



Ox-tail Soup

1 large onion. 1 level tablespoon flour. 

1 carrot. 2 tablespoons cold water. 

2 sprigs parsley. 34 cup sherry. 

1 bay leaf. Salt and pepper, or cayenne. 

Melt the fat and fry in it the carrot and onion 
cut into dice, also the ox-tails which have been cut 
in pieces. When brown add the water, also the celery, 
parsley and bay leaf tied together. When boiling 
put in the barley and simmer four hours. Remove 
the large bones, celery, parsley and bay leaf, and 
thicken the soup with the flour rubbed smooth with 
two tablespoons of cold water. Season rather highly, 
add the sherry, and serve.

Mutton Broth 



2 pounds neck of mutton. 1 small carrot. 
2 quarts cold water. 1 small onion. 

1 level teaspoon salt. 2 level tablespoons barley. 

1 small turnip. 1 level teaspoon chopped parsley. 

Extra salt, and pepper to taste. 

Wipe the meat, cut it into small pieces and place 
in a saucepan with the cold water; let it come slowly 
to the boiling point and then add the salt, which 
causes any scum there may be to rise. Simmer for 
an hour, skimming occasionally. Add the vegetables 
cut into dice, also the barley, and cook till the vege- 
tables are quite tender; season to taste. Add the 
chopped parsley just before serving. 

Turkey Soup 

1 turkey carcass. 1 stick of celery. 

Water to cover. 3^ teaspoon extract of beef. 

1 small onion. 2 level tablespoons rice. 

Seasoning to taste. 

Break the carcass in pieces and remove all the 
stuffing; add water to just cover, and simmer two 
hours with the celery and onion; then remove the 
bones, strain, and add the extract of beef, and then 
the rice which should have been previously cooked 
in boiling salted water. Let the soup reach boiling 
point, season and serve with croutons of fried bread.

through also. Blend the butter and flour in a sauce- 
pan till smooth, but not browned; add the hot tomato 
and stir till boiling. Season, and after cooking five 
minutes put in the soda dissolved in a teaspoonful 
of hot water. The addition of the soda neutralizes 
the acid of the tomato. Just before serving, add the 
milk previously scalded. 



Cream of Oyster Soup 

1 pint oysters. 1 level tablespoon flour. 

1 quart milk. Salt and pepper to taste.

Seasoning and garnish. 

Mince the meat finely, add the whites of the egg, 
slightly beaten, also the shells, and mix with half a 
pint of the stock. When well blended, add with the 
vegetables to the remainder of the stock; whisk while 
heating, then when hot leave it over the fire with- 
out touching till it boils. Cook very gently five 
minutes longer; add half a cup of cold water, and 
after it has stood ten minutes strain through a fine 
cloth that has been wrung out of hot water and spread 
over a bowl or attached to a soup stand. If the first 
liquor which runs through the cloth is not quite clear 
pass it through again. 

Remove any grease that may be on top of the soup 
by passing small pieces of blotting or tissue paper 
over it, so as to absorb the globules of fat; then 
season with salt, celery salt, cayenne, and lemon 
juice if the flavor is desired. Color, if necessary, 
with caramel (the soup should be the color of sherry), 
and serve plain or with any of the following gar- 
nishes : 



GARNISHES FOR CLEAR SOUPS 

For Julienne Soup: To each quart of clear soup 
add one-third cup each carrots and turnips, cut into 
strips an inch long and about the thickness of a match, 
and boiled in water till tender.

FISH 

TO BAKE FISH 

HAVE the fish well washed, and if it is haddock, 
small cod or any small whole fish, the black 
skin on the inside can be removed by rubbing briskly 
with a cloth or small brush dipped in salt. Dry the 
fish and, if to be stuffed, prepare the stuffing by 
the rule given below; place it in the fish and sew 
up the opening with white thread. Lay the fish — 
either flat or fastened with thread or skewers in the 
form of the letter S — in a well-greased baking-pan, 
preferably one kept for this purpose, dredge with flour 
and put in a little dripping or bacon fat over the top. 
If the oven is very hot cover the fish with a greased 
paper during the first part of the baking to prevent 
its becoming too brown. Baste frequently with the 
fat that is in the pan, adding more if needed. Unless 
the fish is well basted it is likely to be dry. Serve 
with a sauce or gravy. 



Stuffing for Baked Fish 

3 slices stale bread. 1 tablespoon chopped pars- 
2 tablespoons chopped ley. 

suet. Salt and pepper to taste. 

1 small onion, finely 1 small egg, and a little milk 

minced. if needed. 

Soak the bread in cold water till quite soft, mash 
it till smooth and add to it the suet, onion, parsley, 
seasonings and egg. Moisten, if necessary, with a 
little milk — the mixture must be just firm enough 
to keep its shape — and fill the fish, sewing up the 
opening as soon as the stuffing is in place. This same 
mixture may be rolled into small balls, baked in 
the pan with the fish, and served as a garnish if pre- 
ferred.

10 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

TO BOIL FISH 

Choose a small, compact fish or a firm slice of a 
large one. Wash thoroughly and wrap in cheese 
cloth, tying the ends of the cloth loosely. If a regu- 
lation fish kettle with drainer is used, it will be easier 
to remove the fish from the pan after cooking; or 
a plate may be placed in the pan and the fish laid 
on it. This prevents any possibility of the cloth 
sticking to the bottom of the pan and also makes 
it easier to remove the fish when cooked. A table- 
spoon of vinegar in the water will keep the fish a 
good color and make the flesh firmer. 

The water should be quite hot, but not boiling, 
when the fish is put in. If plunged into actively 
boiling water the skin is likely to crack. To pre- 
vent this still further the water should only sim- 
mer during the time of cooking. The average time 
allowed for the cooking of boiled fish is about six 
minutes to the pound, unless very thick, when ten 
minutes should be given. When small fish are boiled 
whole the heads are always left on, but the eyes 
removed. 

The fish usually boiled are cod, haddock, halibut, 
mackerel and salmon. 



TO SAUTE FISH 

Clean the fish thoroughly, wipe dry and dip in 
either flour, egg and bread crumbs, or egg and corn 
meal, and saute in a shallow frying-pan, having only 
a little fat in the pan. Cook till one side of the fish 
is brown, then turn with a fish turner, or a thin, flexible 
knife, and brown the other side. The fish may be 
seasoned either before or after cooking. The fat 
used may be either lard, butter, drippings, oil, or bacon 
fat. Small fish, such as pan-fish, porgies, flounders, 
butterfish, or slices of larger fish — halibut or cod 
■ — are suitable for this method of cooking. 



FISH 11 

TO FRY FISH 

Clean the fish and wipe perfectly dry; then dip in 
beaten egg and afterwards in bread crumbs or corn 
meal, but preferably in the crumbs, patting these 
on well that no loose ones may fall off and burn in 
the fat; then plunge the fish, a few pieces at a time, 
in the fat which must be smoking hot and of which 
there must be sufficient in the pan to completely 
cover the fish. Cook golden brown, and drain well 
before serving. 

For full directions as to the preparation and heating 
of the fat, see instructions for Frying, page 29. 



TO BROIL FISH 

Wipe well, season with salt and pepper, and place 
between the wires of a well-greased broiler. Broil 
the flesh side first, then the skin side, turning often 
during the cooking process. 

The more oily fish, such as bluefish, salmon, her- 
ring and mackerel, are best for broiling, though other 
kinds are often cooked this way. When the drier 
varieties are broiled they must be well seasoned after 
cooking, and butter spread and lemon juice sprinkled 
over them just before serving. 



Baked Bluefish in Perfection 

1 large bluefish. Salt, pepper and a little 

\i cup melted butter. onion juice. 

Juice of half a lemon. 

Split the fish down the back, wipe it well and lay 
in a greased baking-pan. Melt the butter and add 
to it the salt, pepper, onion and lemon juice, and 
pour a little of the mixture over the fish. Place in 
a hot oven and bake about half an hour, basting with 
the prepared butter every ten minutes. Serve very 
hot with or without a sauce. 



12 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

Perfect Fish Balls 

2 cups raw potatoes. 1 level tablespoon butter. 

1 cup flaked codfish. Pepper to season. 

1 egg. 

Cut the potatoes in small pieces and cook with the 
fish till the potatoes are tender. Mash very thor- 
oughly till every lump is gone; add the butter, pepper 
and egg, and beat again till the whole is light and 
creamy. Take up a little of the mixture at a time 
with a spoon that has been dipped in hot fat — this 
prevents the mixture sticking to the spoon — and 
drop into a pan containing plenty of smoking-hot 
fat. Cook golden brown — if the fat is the right 
heat this will not take more than a minute — drain 
well and serve with or without bacon. 



Fish Timbales 

2 cups raw cod, haddock 2 eggs. 

or halibut. Seasoning of salt, pepper, 
1 cup bread crumbs. lemon juice and Worces- 

3^ cup cream. tershire sauce. 

Chop, mince or grind the fish till quite fine; add 
the crumbs, cream and seasoning. Beat the whites 
and yolks of the eggs separately, the whites to a 
froth and the yolks until thick. Add the yolks first 
and mix them well in; then just before cooking, fold 
in the whites, mixing only enough to blend them 
with the other ingredients. Turn into well-greased 
moulds — plain ones are best, as the contents are 
likely to turn out better — and steam half an hour, 
either in a saucepan over the fire, or in a covered 
pan containing boiling water, in the oven. In either 
case let the water come halfway up the sides of the 
moulds and keep the pan closely covered. Serve on 
Individual dishes with a sauce poured over them. 



PISH 13 

Codfish Fritters 

Strips of salt codfish. 1 egg. 

2 level tablespoons flour. 14 cup milk. 

Frying fat. 

Cut the fish into strips about the size of the finger 
and soak over night. In the morning drain and dry. 
Make a batter by putting the flour into a bowl, add- 
ing the yolk of egg and the milk, and beating well 
to remove all lumps. Beat the white of the egg to 
a stiff froth, add to the batter and dip the strips of 
fish into it, one at a time. Drop at once into hot 
fat, having enough fat in the pan to completely cover 
the fritters; cook golden brown and drain well before 
serving. 



Scalloped Oysters 

1 quart oysters. 1}4 cups milk. 

3 level tablespoons butter. 14 cup buttered crumbs. 

3 level tablespoons flour. Salt and pepper to taste. 

Put the butter and flour together into a saucepan 
and cook till the butter is melted and blended with 
the flour; add the milk, a little at a time, and cook 
till the mixture boils. Cook five minutes longer 
and then add the seasoning. 

Grease a baking-dish and put a little of the sauce 
in the bottom; cover with oysters which have been 
carefully examined and all bits of shell removed. 
Add more sauce and more oysters till the supply is 
exhausted, having sauce for the top layer. Cover 
with the buttered crumbs and bake about twenty 
minutes in a hot oven. Serve as soon as done that 
the oysters may not become tough. 

To Prepare the Crumbs. Melt one level tablespoon 
of butter in a frying-pan or saucepan and, when hot, 
add the crumbs to it, stirring till they have absorbed 
the butter. By this method the butter is equally 
distributed instead of being in little patches, some 
of the crumbs greasy and others dry. 

This method may be used for scalloped fish. 



14 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

Fried Oysters 

2 dozen oysters. Fine bread crumbs. 

2 eggs. Seasoning. 

Wipe each oyster dry and sprinkle with salt. Beat 
the eggs just enough to mix yolks and whites, and 
dip in the oysters so as to coat all parts with the 
egg. Lift them gently and let any excess of egg drip 
away; then drop each oyster into the crumbs, which 
should be spread on a paper or plate — preferably 
the former, as they will be easier to handle. When 
coated with crumbs, shake gently to remove any 
that may be loose, and set aside till all are done, 
Fry golden brown in smoking-hot fat. 

Always use bread crumbs for frying in preference 
to cracker crumbs. The latter absorb grease, while 
the bread crumbs throw it off. 

TO BOIL LOBSTER 

Put a handful of salt into a kettle of boiling water, 
into which place the lobster head first. Boil from 
twenty to thirty minutes, according to size. Too 
long or too rapid boiling will make the meat tough 
and stringy. 

In buying a lobster choose one that is heavy for 
its size; very large ones are likely to be tough. The 
male lobster is best for boiling, but the female is 
preferred for salads and sauces on account of the 
coral. 

To prepare the coral for use, remove it from the 
lobster and place on a tin in a moderately hot oven 
till quite dry, but not discolored; then pound in a 
mortar and sift. This will keep and is valuable as 
a garnish for salad and for use in sauce. 

TO BROIL LOBSTER 

Take a live lobster and split down the back, be- 
ginning at the head, and remove the stomach and 



FISH 15 

intestines. Open fully and place on a broiler, cook 
the flesh side first, then the shell; crack the large 
claws, and serve very hot with melted butter, lemon 
and Chili sauce. 



Lobster Croquettes

lobster (boiled). A grating of nutmeg. 

2 level tablespoons butter. Salt and pepper to taste. 

2 level tablespoons flour. 1 teaspoon lemon juice. 

Egg and bread crumbs. 

Mince the lobster meat as finely as possible, adding 
the coral if there is any. Cream the butter and flour 
in a saucepan and, when mixed, add the milk, and 
cook to a stiff sauce; add the salt, pepper, lemon and 
nutmeg, and mix well. While still hot add the lob- 
ster and spread on a plate to cool, having the mix- 
ture about half an inch thick. When cold, shape 
into cutlet form, using the blade of a flexible knife 
and the fingers, or roll with the hands into the shape 
of very thick corks, or form with the hands or a tin 
mould into cones; dip in egg and bread crumbs as 
directed for the frying of fish (page 30), and fry 
golden brown in smoking-hot fat. Drain well before 
serving. 

Stuffed Fillets of Fish 

2 level tablespoons butter. Lemon juice. 

2 level tablespoons flour. Salt and pepper. 

z /± cup milk or fish stock. 8 fillets of fish. 

Y2 cup chopped shrimps, lobster or mushrooms. 

Melt the butter and blend the flour with it; pour 
in the milk slowly, stir until boiling, season and add 
the mushrooms or shrimp. Trim the fillets of fish 
neatly, spread with the mixture, fold and fasten 
with a small skewer. Bake in a moderate oven, 
covering the pan with greased paper, and adding 
one-half cup of water to prevent burning. Serve 
with horseradish sauce.

Shrimp Patties 

1 cup picked shrimps, either 1 egg yolk. 

fresh or canned. 1 teaspoon lemon juice. 

1 cup cream sauce. Salt and pepper to taste. 

Slight grating of nutmeg. 

Make the sauce by blending together in a sauce- 
pan two level tablespoons butter with the same quan- 
tity flour; then stir in half a cup thin cream and the 
same of milk. Stir until boiling, cook five minutes, 
put in the seasonings, and the shrimps which may 
be divided if very large. Heat thoroughly and, just 
before serving, add the yolk of the egg. Fill little 
puff paste cases and serve. 



Moulded Fish 

1 cup cold minced fish. 1 cup white sauce. 

2 eggs. 1 tablespoon parsley. 

First make the sauce by blending two level table- 
spoons butter with the same quantity flour, then stir 
in slowly one cup of milk, and cook three minutes 
after the sauce boils. Season to taste with salt, pepper 
and lemon juice; add the parsley, fish and yolks of 
eggs. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff froth and 
fold them in. Half fill small moulds with the mix- 
ture, and bake or steam half an hour. Serve with 
horseradish sauce.

MEATS 

THE CHOICE OF MEATS 

IN considering how to buy meat, we must look at 
the relative cost as compared with the nutriment 
to be gained from the different cuts no less than at 
the qualities which go to make good meat. The most 
expensive portions of the animal are not necessarily 
the best, for more nutriment can be often obtained 
from a cheaper cut, provided proper care and time 
are taken for the cooking. Much unnecessary ex- 
pense is incurred in housekeeping, because meals 
are not planned sufficiently in advance to allow the 
cheaper cuts, which require long cooking, to be used. 

The meat of young animals is more tender but 
less nutritious than that from animals of mature 
growth. 

Beef and mutton — the standard meats — are al- 
ways in season; but lamb is at its best in the sum- 
mer and fall, veal in the spring and early summer, 
while pork should be eaten only in the colder months. 

The best beef is the flesh of a steer about four 
years old. It should be bright red in color, firm, 
and marbled in appearance from the blending of fat 
and lean which shows even feeding and that the 
animal has not been rapidly fattened for killing. 
There should be also a fair proportion of creamy 
white fat next the surface. 

Lamb and mutton have a larger proportion of fat 
than beef, and the fat is harder. Good mutton is 
thick, the flesh fine grained and of a bright color. 
The strong mutton flavor, so often found, can be 
practically eliminated by the careful removal of the 
pink skin above the fat on the outer surface of the 
meat. 

Lamb is smaller and lighter in color than mutton. 
One distinguishing test between the two is that in 
lamb when the bone is broken or cut, as in the case 
of a leg or chops, it will be found red and rough; 

19 



20 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

while as the animal grows older the blood recedes 
from the bones and leaves them white and smooth. 

The flesh of veal should be pink and the fat white. 
If the flesh is white it denotes that either the animal 
was too young or was bled before killing. In either 
case when the flesh is white it is better avoided. 

Veal must be very thoroughly cooked; is difficult 
of digestion and contains less nutriment than beef, 
mutton or lamb. It is somewhat tasteless and re- 
quires more seasoning than other meats. 

Pork is another of the less wholesome meats. While 
obtainable during all seasons, it should be eaten 
only in winter, and then sparingly. Pork contains 
a larger proportion of fat than any other meat and 
requires long, slow cooking. The fat should be a 
clear white and the lean pink. Salt pork, bacon and 
ham are more wholesome than the fresh meat; and 
bacon fat is considered by physicians to be a more 
valuable and easily assimilated form of fat than any 
other. 

All meats should be removed from the wrapping 
papers as soon as received, wiped with a damp cloth 
and placed near, but not directly on, the ice. 

The processes most commonly employed for the 
cooking of meats are, roasting, broiling, stewing and 
boiling. 

TO ROAST MEAT 

First, wipe with a damp cloth, then skewer and 
tie if necessary to keep the meat in shape. For beef, 
mutton and lamb allow fifteen minutes for each 
pound and fifteen minutes over; for veal and pork 
twenty minutes to the pound and twenty minutes 
over. These close-grained meats are very indiges- 
tible unless well cooked. Some cooks flour meat 
before roasting. 

As the object in roasting is to keep the juices within 
the meat it is necessary to apply intense heat at 
first, so as to sear the outside and form a firm coating 
through which the juices cannot escape. There- 
fore, when roasting, have the oven sufficiently hot 



MEATS 21 

when the meat goes in, to accomplish this result. At 
the end of fifteen minutes the heat may be reduced 
and the cooking proceed more slowly. The meat 
should be frequently basted with the fat that flows 
from it, to prevent the outside becoming burned or 
dry. It may also be dredged or sprinkled once or 
twice with flour and salt. Some cooks use covered 
roasting pans, claiming that the meat is kept more 
moist and the work of basting eliminated. 

TO BROIL MEAT 

Broiling is practically the same method as roast- 
ing, but is applied to smaller pieces of meat, only 
choice portions being suitable for this method of 
cooking. The fire must be hot and clear, the object 
being, as in roasting, to keep the juices in the meat 
and, therefore, it is necessary to sear the outside 
quickly. When this is done the meat should be moved 
a little farther from the fire, and the cooking pro- 
ceed more slowly. The broiler should be slightly 
greased and heated before the meat is placed on it. 

When broiling by gas have the burners lighted 
fully seven minutes before the meat is placed under 
them, that the heat may be sufficient to sear the 
outer surface at once; otherwise the meat is likely to 
be tough and dry. 

TO STEW MEAT 

In stewing, the less expensive parts of meat are 
utilized and, consequently, plenty of time must be 
allowed for the cooking. If hurried, toughness is 
almost inevitable. By this method of cooking some 
of the juices are drawn out into the gravy. Meat 
may be stewed by itself or with the addition of vari- 
ous vegetables; it may be also enriched by frying 
both meat and vegetables in a little fat before adding 
water or stock, both color and flavor being improved 
if this is done. It is a decided advantage, when pos- 
sible, to prepare a stew the day before it is to be 
served, as the fat can be removed from the gravy 



22 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

more easily when cold. Stews made from meat which 
has been cooked once will naturally require more 
seasoning and flavoring with sauces and other con- 
diments than when fresh meat is used. 

A stew is better and more savory if the gravy is 
browned, seasoned and thickened before the meat is 
added. 

TO BOIL FRESH MEATS 

In boiling, it is intended that the greater part of 
the juices shall be retained in the meat. Therefore 
place the joint, after wiping, in boiling water and 
keep it boiling about five minutes, with the object 
of hardening the surface and preventing the goodness 
being drawn out into the liquid. Twenty minutes 
to the pound and twenty minutes additional should 
be the time allowed. 

The water must be boiling (212 degrees) when the 
cooking begins, but 135 degrees (simmering heat) 
will suffice after a few minutes. Far more food is 
spoiled by the application of too much heat than 
too little. Very gentle bubbling will indicate the 
right temperature of the water. 

Meat is sometimes steamed by cooking in a closely 
covered steamer over boiling water. By this method 
there is very little weight and practically no good- 
ness lost, but a longer time — thirty minutes to the 
pound — must be allowed. 

In boiling salt meats, the method is changed, as 
they are put into cold water that the slow heating 
may draw out some of the salt. In the event of the 
meat being more than ordinarily salt, the first water 
is sometimes thrown away when it reaches boiling 
point, and fresh added. 

The liquor in which fresh meat has been boiled 
makes a good foundation for soup stock. That from 
salt meat, if not too salt, may be utilized for bean or 
pea soup. 

Broiled Lamb 

Slices of cold roast or 2 tablespoons olive oil. 

boiled lamb. 1 tablespoon lemon juice- 

Salt and pepper. 



MEATS 23 

Cut the slices of meat about half an inch thick 
from a part of the joint that is not too well cooked. 
Mix the oil and lemon juice together and let the 
meat stand in the mixture for an hour. The oil will 
enrich, and the lemon make the fibre of the meat 
tender. Place the slices in a broiler and cook about 
four minutes over a hot fire. Season rather highly, 
and serve with currant jelly or maitre d'hotel sauce. 



Hot-Pot 

2 pounds of lamb suitable 4 onions. 

for stewing. Salt, pepper and a little flour. 

2 pounds potatoes. Water or stock. 

Cut the meat into pieces convenient for serving. 
Peel the potatoes and cut them into small, thick 
pieces; slice the onions thinly. Mix the salt, pepper 
and flour and roll each piece of meat in the mixture. 
Put a layer of potatoes in a deep dish or bowl (a wide- 
mouthed bean pot is a satisfactory dish), then a layer 
of meat, next sliced onion, repeating the process till 
the dish is filled. Have potatoes for the last layer 
and fill the dish with water or stock. Bake three 
hours in a moderate oven, adding more water if nec- 
essary. Serve in the dish in which it is cooked. 



Brown Stew of Lamb 

2 pounds of lamb. 2 level tablespoons dripping. 

2 onions. V/^ level tablespoons flour. 

2 carrots. 1^ pints water or stock. 

1 head celery or a little Salt and pepper,

Cut the meat into pieces convenient for serving. 
Peel the onions, scrape the carrots and wash and 
scrape the celery. 

Melt the drippings in a saucepan and fry the meat 
golden brown on all sides, removing as soon as browned; 
put in the flour and brown that also. Add the stock 
or water and stir till boiling; then put in the meat and

8 medium-sized potatoes. Salt and pepper. 

About 1% pints water. 

Cut the meat into pieces of convenient size for 
serving. Remove some of the fat and put the meat 
into a saucepan with the water which should be al- 
most at the boiling point; add the onions peeled and 
cut into thin slices, also the carrot scraped and sliced. 
Cook very gently — the water should only simmer, 
for hard boiling would toughen the meat — and at 
the end of an hour add the potatoes, peeled and cut 
in thick pieces. Season to taste with salt and pepper, 
and continue to cook till the potatoes are tender. 
Then serve all together on one dish.

Remove the blade bone from the shoulder, or have 
the butcher do it. Put the bread crumbs into a bowl 
with the parsley, lemon, suet, salt and pepper, and 
mix them with the egg well beaten. Stuff the cavity 
from which the bone was removed, sew up the open- 
ing, and roast, basting frequently with a little fat or 
the meat will be dry. 

Allow fifteen minutes to the pound. Serve with 
a thick, brown gravy. Other dressings may be used 
if preferred. 

Beefsteak Pie

Cut the meat in thin slices, and a little fat into 
very small pieces. Mix the flour, salt and pepper 
on a plate, and dip each piece of meat into it. Place 
a little fat in each piece of meat and roll up. Lay 
these rolls of meat in a pie dish, and fill the dish about 
two-thirds with cold water. Cover the dish and 
bake in a moderate oven for one and one-half hours. 
When the meat is tender, cover with a plain crust, 
the rule for which is given under " Pastry," and 
bake half an hour longer.

Have the meat cut in a thick, compact piece. If 
necessary, tie and skewer so that it will keep its shape. 

Melt the drippings in a saucepan (an old-fashioned, 
round bottom " Scotch bowl " is the best), and brown 
the meat on all sides; pour the boiling water over it 
and cover closely. Simmer as gently as possible for 
two hours; then season, and add the vegetables scraped 
or peeled as they need, and cut into pieces. Cook 
till the vegetables are tender; then remove the meat 
and vegetables from the pan and thicken the gravy 
with the flour mixed smoothly with a little cold water. 
If necessary add more water while the roast is cook- 
ing that there may be sufficient gravy to cover the 
vegetables.

FRYING 

FRYING is one of the most useful methods of cook- 
ing, especially of recooking or reheating such 
small combinations as rissoles, croquettes and small, 
made dishes which hardly need more than heating 
through, and browning for the sake of giving them 
an attractive appearance. It is, however, one of 
the least understood methods of cooking as well as 
one of the most poorly performed; hence the discredit 
into which it has fallen. 

The difference between frying and sauteing should 
be clearly understood. The former needs sufficient 
fat to completely immerse the article to be fried; 
the latter requires only a little fat in the pan, but 
despite the seeming extravagance of " plenty of fat " 
the former is, for most foods, the better and more 
digestible form of preparation. 

The very best medium for all frying is olive oil, 
but the price is prohibitive to most people. 

Cottonseed oil, if properly refined and carefully 
used, comes next, but it requires care to avoid un- 
pleasant odor from overheating and, again, many 
persons object to cotton oil because they have eaten 
food carelessly prepared with it. 

Lard is most commonly used, but is considered 
by many to be unhealthful. It seems, therefore, 
that the frying medium likely to be pleasing to all 
and free from most objections is good beef drippings 
which can be clarified at home, a rule for which is 
given on page 31. 

Cast steel or aluminum pans should be used as they 
retain the steady temperature required for fryingc 
They should be fairly deep, and have straight sides. 
A frying basket made of wire mesh is exceedingly 
convenient where much frying is done. The advan- 
tage of the basket is that several articles can be low- 
ered into and raised from the fat at one time, and 
the risk of breaking the food in lifting it from the 

29 



30 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

fat is lessened. A wire dipper or spoon must be provided 
if there is no frying basket. 

The temperature of frying-fat is very important. 
As few cooks possess a fryometer the following sim- 
ple tests will serve to decide when fat is at the proper 
heat for the purpose desired: 

For foods that have been previously cooked and 
need only reheating and browning, the fat should 
be so hot that a faint blue vapor is seen rising from 
it when the pan is held against the light. This ap- 
plies when animal fat is used. Oil need not be quite 
so hot, and should be tested by frying a small piece 
of crust in it. If this quickly turns brown, the fat 
is hot; but if slow to take color, heat a little longer 
before beginning to fry. 

Doughnuts and crullers, being heavy and solid as 
compared with croquettes or other small fried foods, 
should be cooked in fat at a lower temperature. The 
best test is to put a small piece of dough in the pan 
and cook it. If it sinks to the bottom and almost 
immediately reappears, increases in bulk and slowly 
browns, the remainder of the dough should be cooked. 
Do not attempt to cook too many crullers or dough- 
nuts at one time as they cool the fat and, conse- 
quently, absorb grease; four or five are the most 
that should be cooked at one time. Drain as soon 
as done, on unglazed paper as this absorbs grease; 
then sprinkle with sugar or shake them with a little 
sugar in a paper bag. 

After frying any dough mixture the fat will appear 
cloudy from the flour that has fallen into it, but if 
a few raw potatoes are cooked in the fat the cloudi- 
ness will disappear. 

Fat should always be strained through a fine sieve 
or cheese cloth after using, to remove any foreign 
particles that have fallen into it from the food. If 
not removed these will burn and probably spoil the 
fat. 

To prepare meats, fish and croquettes for frying 
they should be coated with egg and bread crumbs. 
For this beat one egg yolk and white together and 



FRYING 31 

add a tablespoon of water, partly to thin it and partly 
to increase the bulk. Have ready on a paper or plate 
plenty of fine bread crumbs. Do not use cracker 
crumbs if it can be avoided as they absorb grease and 
do not give as pleasing a color. 

Having trimmed and shaped the article to be fried, 
lay it in the beaten egg and with a small brush cover 
it completely; lift with the blade of a knife and place 
upside down in the bread crumbs. If the knife blade 
has displaced any of the egg, brush over again. Toss 
in the crumbs till completely covered, then shake 
off those which are loose that they may not fall off 
in the fat and burn. Continue till all are coated, 
then pass the remaining crumbs through a sieve and 
put away till needed again. 

To prepare Beef Fat for Frying. Buy four pounds of 
soft flank fat, or " cod fat " as it is sometimes called; 
do not get suet as it is too hard and also costs more 
than the flank fat. Cut into pieces the size of an 
English walnut and remove all flesh and gristle. Put 
into a large pan with a pint of water and cook fast, 
without a cover, till all the water has evaporated, 
when the liquid in the pan will be clear and like honey. 
As long as there is water remaining it will be thick 
and milky looking. Now cover the saucepan, and cook 
very gently till the pieces of skin and fat cells float 
on top of the clear fat. Strain and use for all frying, 
either plain or mixed with lard. If these directions 
are carefully followed the fat will be good as long as 
there is any remaining.

POULTRY 

THE PREPARATION OF POULTRY 

POULTRY should be cleaned and dressed as soon 
as possible after being killed. Pinfeathers are 
best removed with a small knife or by the aid of a 
tong-shaped strawberry huller. 

To draw the tendons from the drumstick, make 
an incision lengthwise between the bones of the leg, 
below the joint, while the foot is still attached to 
the body. Next, take a strong, thin skewer and 
pick up the tendons, one at a time, through the in- 
cision; hold the skewer, with the tendon on it, with 
the first two fingers and give a vigorous pull. The 
tendon should come out easily, and the process can 
be repeated till all are removed. There are seven 
small and two large tendons. If these are removed 
the drumstick is likely to be as tender as any portion 
of the bird. 

The feet may now be cut off a little below the 
joint, and long hairs on the body removed by singe- 
ing. Do this by holding it over a burner of the gas 
range or by applying a lighted taper or twist of 
lighted paper. The former method is the better one, 
as there is no danger of smoking the skin. 

To remove the down from a duck or goose, rub 
over with two teaspoons of alcohol, lay the bird in a 
dish or pan and set fire to the alcohol. The down 
will be burned off more quickly and thoroughly than 
by any other method. 

The bird is now ready for drawing and, especially 
if it is to be roasted, this had better be done at home 
as the butcher usually makes far too large an opening 
in the flesh. Make an incision in the skin below 
the breast bone and with the hand remove the giz- 
zard, heart, intestines and liver, being very careful not 
to break the gall bag which is attached to the latter, 

35 



36 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

as it would cause the parts with which it comes in 
contact to taste bitter. Remove the lungs, which lie 
on either side of the backbone, also the kidneys, wind- 
pipe and crop. The latter is reached by inserting the 
fingers under the skin of the neck after the head is 
cut off. The oil bag found at the base of the tail 
must also be removed. Wipe the bird well both 
inside and out. If there seems to be any indication 
that it has been kept too long, wash with water in 
which a little soda has been dissolved and put a small 
piece of charcoal in the body to absorb any possible 
odor. 

To Truss a Fowl. Draw the legs up close to the 
body and fasten in place with a skewer run through 
both drumsticks and the body. Do the same with 
the wings, skewering them so that they lie flat to 
the body. Cut the neck off close, fold the skin of the 
neck under and fasten it down with a small skewer. 
Cut a slit in the skin just above that made for the 
removal of the intestines, and pull the tail through 
this slit, fastening it in place with a long string, that 
the opening may be concealed. Now take the same 
string and twist it around the ends of the skewer 
that holds the legs; cross the string over the back 
of the bird and fasten to the other skewer, so as 
to hold all four joints in place and keep them from 
slipping. 

To Prepare a Bird for Broiling. Remove tendons 
and pinfeathers as directed in rule for preparation 
of poultry. With a sharp knife split the bird full 
length down the back, remove insides as before de- 
scribed, wipe, and before cooking cut through the 
wing and leg joints to simplify serving the bird at 
table. 

Dressing for Roast Chicken. Some claim that a 
stuffed chicken is a spoiled chicken and that the 
dressing absorbs much of the moisture and flavor 
from the flesh. If preferred, the dressing may be 
cooked separately and served with the bird.

3^ cup butter. Salt and pepper to taste. 

Remove the shells from the nuts and blanch by 
pouring boiling water over them; allow them to stand 
five minutes when the brown skin can be removed 
with the fingers and a knife. Cook the nuts in boiling 
salted water till tender, which will probably take about 
half an hour; mash finely, add the butter and season- 
ing, also the crumbs which have had the scalded 
milk poured over them. Mix well, and use for stuffing 
either chicken or turkey.

Crumble the bread finely, add the parsley, lemon 
rind, herbs, salt and pepper. Chop the suet and add 
to the other ingredients; or if butter is used, melt it 
in the water or milk and add, mixing well. Fill the 
body of the bird with the dressing. 

For stuffing turkey double all the ingredients. 



Sage and Onion Dressing 

10 good-sized onions. 1 teaspoon powdered sage. 

\y% cups stale bread crumbs. Salt and pepper to taste. 

Peel the onions and cook till tender in boiling salted 
water, pouring off the first water and adding fresh 
after they have cooked ten minutes, to take away much 
of the strong taste and odor. When thoroughly 
cooked, drain and chop the onions finely; add the 
sage, bread crumbs and seasonings, and use as a 
stuffing for goose, duck or boned leg of pork. This 
may be also cooked in a separate tin in the oven and 
served with the meat, if preferred.

the bones. Cool the bird, strain, and continue to 
cook the liquor till it is reduced to three cupfuls. 

Remove all skin and bone from the fowl and lay 
the meat in a mould, light and dark meat alternately, 
adding the hard-cooked eggs cut in slices. Season 
the liquor and add to it the granulated gelatine that 
has been soaked half an hour in a third of a cup of

from the pan and let the chicken become quite cold; 
then dry each piece thoroughly. Heat half a cup of 
olive oil in a shallow frying-pan, add the onion to it 
and when smoking hot put in the chicken, a little at 
a time, and cook golden brown. When it is all cooked, 
add to the remaining oil a cup and a half of the liquor 
in which the chicken was cooked, bring to the boiling

TO ROAST DUCK 

A domestic duck requires almost twice as much 
cooking as a wild duck. The latter should always 
be rare and will take about thirty minutes in a hot 
oven. Wild ducks should always have strips of bacon 
or salt pork laid across the breast while roasting, to 
keep them moist. Both kinds need thorough basting. 

For dressing see recipes for Sage and Onion Dress- 
ing or Potato Dressing. 

Wild ducks are never stuffed.

Cut the pork into small pieces and fry; add the 
vegetables, bay leaf and parsley, and cook five min- 
utes. Put in the duck, either trussed as for roasting 
or cut into joints. Cook in the fat till browned; 
then place in a baking-dish or casserole. Pour the 
vegetables and fat over it and add three cups of boil- 
ing water. Cover closely and cook in a moderate 
oven till tender, adding more water if necessary. 
Dish the bird, and thicken the gravy with two table- 
spoonfuls each of flour and butter rubbed smoothly 
together. Season highly, and serve with currant 
jelly or apple sauce.

each joint into the water and then into the flour, 
salt and pepper sifted together, shaking off all that 
does not cling to the chicken. Heat the butter and 
lard in a frying-pan and cook the pieces of chicken 
slowly that they may be done through, turning often 
while cooking. Keep hot till all are done, and serve 
with white sauce or brown gravy.

Cut the chicken into good-sized pieces and wipe 
with a damp cloth. Cut the pork small and try it 
out in a saucepan, and when the fat runs freely put 
in the chicken, a few pieces at a time, and cook till 
slightly colored, but not browned. Put the tougher 
parts of the bird at the bottom of the pan, then add 
the onion and cover with boiling water. Cover 
closely and cook very slowly till tender, adding the 
seasoning at the end of an hour. It is not possible 
to give the exact length of time required for the cook- 
ing, as some chickens take longer than others. 

A few minutes before serving, remove the meat 
from the pan, and thicken the gravy with the butter 
and flour rubbed smoothly together. Cook five min-

and remove all stalks. Chop finely and wash again, 
placing the chopped parsley in the corner of a cloth 
and twisting the cloth that none may escape, then 
hold under the water faucet and press the parsley 
with the thumb and finger to get rid of the excess of 
green coloring matter liberated by the chopping; 
otherwise this would make the sauce a dull, rather 
dirty-looking color, instead of perfectly white with mi- 
nute particles of green parsley distributed through it.

VEGETABLES 

THE PREPARATION AND COOKING OF VEGETABLES 

THE usual method of cooking vegetables in a 
large quantity of water, which is afterwards 
thrown away, is not to be recommended, as it means 
the loss of much valuable saline matter as well as 
sugar. 

Where the cooking liquor is not used, with such 
vegetables as peas, turnips, beans, etc., it is well to 
add a little sugar while cooking, to replace that which 
is lost. Root vegetables are all improved by the 
addition of a little butter when being served. 

It is difficult to give a definite time for the cook- 
ing of either root or green vegetables, as it depends 
largely on their age and freshness. Cook all green 
vegetables rapidly, putting them, after washing, into 
boiling salted water. Cook without a cover as this 
preserves the color. Some cooks attain this end by 
putting a little soda in the water, but this is not 
advisable. As soon as tender, remove from the water, 
because too much cooking causes the flavor to deteri- 
orate. 

The exception to the rule of cooking green vege- 
tables in boiling water is spinach, which requires no 
water other than that which clings to the leaves 
after washing. 

Cabbage, Cauliflower, Dandelion and Beet Greens, 

wash thoroughly, remove dead leaves and stand in 
cold, salted water for an hour. This removes any 
insects that may be hidden among the leaves. Cab- 
bage is usually cut into quarters when being cleaned; 
cauliflower is sometimes divided into small flower 
stalks, and when this is not done it is wise to make 
a cross-cut in the stalk; otherwise, being hard, it is 
not likely to be sufficiently cooked as soon as the 
rest of the plant. 

Spinach requires more washing than any other 
vegetable, because it grows in a sandy soil, close to 

63 



64 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

the ground. Remove roots and dead leaves, then 
wash by placing in a large vessel of cold water, toss 
about and then transfer to fresh water. Repeat this 
process till all sand is removed and the last water 
is quite clear — from six to ten washings are usually- 
required. 

Beets need no preparation before cooking, and 
must be boiled without even cleaning. The tops 
should be cut off several inches above the beets and 
the beets cooked till tender in boiling water; young 
beets require cooking about an hour, old ones several 
hours. 

Summer Squash may be cooked without peeling if 
very young, but if the skin is at all likely to be tough, 
it should be removed. Drain the squash very thor- 
oughly after cooking; or put it in a cloth and wring 
the ends in opposite directions. 

Hubbard Squash may be baked, boiled or steamed, 
the former being the better method as it leaves the 
squash drier. 

To Bake Squash. Cut it into large pieces, place 
skin side up in a baking-pan and cook till tender. 
Scrape the flesh from the skin, and season to taste. 

Eggplant should be cut into thick slices, dipped 
in beaten egg and bread crumbs and fried in a little 
drippings or bacon fat. 

To Stuff and Bake Eggplant. Boil it for half an 
hour, then cut in halves, scoop out the fleshy part, 
chop finely, mix with half its bulk of bread crumbs, 
a little onion juice, chopped parsley or any other 
seasoning desired; replace the mixture in the shell 
and bake the whole three-quarters of an hour. A 
little drippings or butter put over the top of the 
filling before baking is an improvement. Serve plain 
or with brown gravy. 

Asparagus should be scraped and the tough part 
of the stalk removed; then tied in bunches and cooked 
till tender in boiling salted water. 



VEGETABLES 65 

Green Corn should be cooked as soon as possible 
after gathering. Remove the husk and silky fibre 
and break the ears if too long to go into the kettle 
easily; cook in boiling water just long enough to 
thicken the milk of the grain — from twelve to twenty- 
five minutes will be required, according to the age of 
the corn. If it can not be cooked as soon as gathered, 
leave the husk on till the last moment as it prevents 
the corn drying and becoming tough. 

Peas should have fresh-looking, well-filled, crisp 
pods. They should not be shelled till just before 
cooking and will have a richer flavor if some of the 
pods are cooked in the water. Have the water boil- 
ing and cook the peas about twenty minutes. Fresh 
peas are more tender and seem to be more easily 
digested than dried ones, but the latter, partly owing 
to the evaporation of water in the drying process, 
are, pound for pound, more nutritious and nitroge- 
nous. 

All fresh vegetables should be crisp and firm when 
put on the fire to cook, and if for any reason this 
crispness is lacking, it may be restored by soaking 
in very cold water. This soaking may be necessary 
for a few minutes only, but in extreme cases it will 
take several hours to attain the desired result. 

In cooking all green vegetables it is better to have 
the saucepan only partly covered, to permit the 
escape of some of the volatile matter liberated by 
heat; it also insures a better color. Green vegetables 
are sometimes prepared for the table by blanching, 
that is, cooking in fast-boiling water from five to 
twenty minutes, having the saucepan uncovered, the 
time required depending on the vegetable. The 
water is then drained off and cooking completed with 
the addition of a little butter or drippings, season- 
ing and, in the case of very dry vegetables, a little 
stock or water. The saucepan should be covered 
and the cooking done very gently. Vegetables are 
better flavored when cooked by this process than 
when simply boiled in a large quantity of water. 



66 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

Few cooks realize the importance of cooking fresh 
vegetables as soon as possible after preparing them. 
Statistics show that in the case of potatoes, peeled 
and left soaking in water for several hours, the loss 
in nitrogenous matter was 50 per cent, and in mineral 
matter 40 per cent; while when placed at once in 
boiling water after peeling, they lost only 8 per cent 
and 19 per cent respectively, during the cooking. 

Steamed vegetables lose only about one-third as 
much food value as when immersed in boiling water, 
but more fuel is used as they cook more slowly. 

The greatest changes that occur when cooking 
vegetables are the swelling and bursting of starch 
grains, softening of cellular tissue and development 
of flavors and odors; while if the cooking is too long 
continued, flavor and odor are partly or entirely lost. 

There are several ways of eliminating, at least, a 
part of the odor of cooking vegetables. One, to dis- 
card the first cooking-water after five minutes and 
replacing it with fresh; another, to place a small 
piece of charcoal in the pan with the vegetables; or 
with onions or greens cook a slice of red pepper, fresh 
or dried, in the pan. 

Potatoes should always be kept in a cool, dark 
place. In warmth and light they are liable to sprout, 
which is undesirable. They are so commonly used 
that we might expect them served in perfection, 
but in reality few vegetables are so poorly cooked. 
If potatoes are peeled before cooking, it should be 
done as thinly as possible; the flavor is better and 
the food value greater if the skin is left on. Always 
cook potatoes of even size at one time that all may 
be done together. 

Baking is the best method of cooking, as all the 
potash salts are retained and dry heat bursts the 
starch cells, rendering the potatoes mealy and di- 
gestible. When baked or boiled in their skins they 
must be eaten as soon as cooked, otherwise the flavor 
changes quickly. If delay is necessary, break the 
skin to let some of the moisture escape. 



VEGETABLES 67 

To boil potatoes, either in their jackets or when 
peeled, put them into enough boiling water to cover, 
add a tablespoon of salt for each dozen potatoes, 
cover the saucepan closely, and if of moderate size 
cook thirty minutes — small ones may take a little 
less time. Test with a fork and, if tender, drain at 
once, let the steam pass off and shake the potatoes 
in the pan to make them floury. If they can not be 
served at once, cover lightly with cheese cloth to 
prevent the cold air reaching them. 

Creamed or escalloped potatoes are better pre- 
pared from left-over baked ones rather than boiled, 
as they are drier and of better flavor. The same 
applies to German fried, that is, cold cooked pota- 
toes fried; also to Lyonnaise potatoes, that is, pota- 
toes fried with minced onion, or chives and chopped 
parsley. 

Savory Potatoes 

6 moderate-sized potatoes. 1 pint milk. 

2 small onions. Salt and pepper to taste. 

Pare and cut the potatoes in thin slices; put a 
layer of them in a baking-dish, sprinkle with finely- 
minced onion, salt and pepper, repeating in the same 
order till the dish is full or the ingredients all used. 
Pour enough milk over the potatoes to cover them, 
and bake slowly till tender, adding more milk as 
that in the dish boils away.

side is browned. Invert on a hot dish that the browned 
side may be uppermost. 

Potato Croquettes 

2 cups mashed potato. 2 teaspoons chopped parsley. 

1 level tablespoon butter. 3^ teaspoon onion juice. 

Salt, pepper and a little 1 egg. 
celery salt. 

Pass the potato through a potato ricer or sieve to 
insure all lumps being removed. This is best done 
when the potatoes are freshly boiled and hot. Add 
and beat in the butter, seasoning, parsley and onion 
juice, and when these are well mixed stir in the well- 
beaten egg, or as much of it as is required to make 
the potato just firm enough to handle easily. Form 
into croquettes of any desired shape, dip in beaten 
egg and bread crumbs (see instructions for Frying, 
page 30), and cook golden brown in hot fat. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes

Salt and pepper to taste. 

Peel and cut the potatoes into slices, peel and 
thinly slice the onions. Heat the butter or oil and fry 
the onions in it till they just begin to turn yellow; then 
put in the potatoes and seasoning, and cook golden 
brown, turning the potatoes about constantly in the 
pan that they may cook and color evenly. 

Creole Tomatoes 

4 large tomatoes. Salt and cayenne. 

1 small onion. 4 level tablespoons butter or 

2 green peppers, finely drippings. 

chopped. 2 level tablespoons flour. 

1 cup milk and cream.

chopped onion, also the peppers from which the 
seeds and veins have been removed. Season highly, 
put a small piece of butter or drippings on each piece 
of tomato, using two tablespoonfuls for the purpose. 
Pour half a cup of water into the pan, and bake in a 
quick oven till the tomatoes are tender. Melt the 
remaining two tablespoons of butter or drippings and 
brown the flour in it; add milk and cream, also the 
liquor from the baking-pan, stir till boiling and cook 
three minutes longer. Dish the tomatoes on squares 
of toast and pour the sauce around them. 



Scalloped Cauliflower 

1 cauliflower. 3^ cup bread crumbs. 

1 level tablespoon butter. 3^ cup nuts. 

3^ cup cream. Salt and pepper. 

1 cup milk. 

Cook the cauliflower in boiling salted milk and 
water till tender, using the milk to keep the cauli- 
flower white; drain, and break the vegetable into 
small pieces. Heat the butter and cream together 
and add seasoning and nuts. Grease a baking-dish 
and sprinkle it with crumbs; put in a layer of cauli- 
flower, then a little of the sauce, more cauliflower 
and more sauce, till the dish is filled or the ingre- 
dients used. Sprinkle the remainder of the crumbs 
on top, and place in a hot oven to brown.

SALADS 

SALADS AND SALAD DRESSINGS 

ALMOST every variety of vegetables and fruits may 
be made into salads. Eggs are used also, as well 
as many kinds of fish and meat. Vegetable salads 
are the most common and should therefore receive 
first consideration. 

Naturally, lettuce heads the list. It is more pop- 
ular because we can get it when other vegetables 
are almost unobtainable. The round, close heads are 
more generally used than the long-leaf variety. Curly 
lettuce, while pretty, is tougher than either of the 
other two. Lettuce contains little nutriment, but 
is rich in mineral salts. 

Sorrel is one of the wild salad plants and deserves 
to be better known and appreciated. It has a slightly 
acid taste, and for this reason be sparing of the vine- 
gar when dressing it. Sorrel may be used as a salad 
by itself, or blended with other salad plants such 
as lettuce or spinach. 

Mustard and cress used together make a good salad. 

Small yellow tomatoes dipped for a moment in 
boiling water, then peeled with a sharp knife, thor- 
oughly chilled, seasoned, sprinkled with chopped 
parsley, piled on lettuce leaves and served with a 
French dressing make a salad that tastes as good 
as it looks. 

In winter, when fresh salad plants are hard to 
obtain, a tomato jelly or salad made from canned or 
fresh (cooked) string beans, or even from the re- 
mains of baked beans seasoned with parsley and 
onion juice, is economical and satisfying. 

THE CLEANSING OF SALAD PLANTS 

Lettuce. Growing so near the ground, much dirt 
gets into lettuce. In preparing it for the table, sepa- 
rate all the leaves and wash well; the leaves may be 

73 



74 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

left in water about half an hour to absorb moisture 
and become crisp, but should then be drained in 
one of the globe-shaped baskets made for the purpose, 
or dried in a soft cloth. If to be kept for any length of 
time, wrap the lettuce in damp cheese cloth and 
place near, but not on, the ice. 

Water Cress. This plant requires very careful at- 
tention when being prepared for the table, as many 
non-edible leaves are gathered with it, also because 
small water insects cling closely to it. A little salt 
in the water in which the cress is washed will greatly 
aid their removal. 

Endive, Field Salad and Dandelion. These leaves 
must be carefully picked over, foreign matter re- 
moved, and after freshening in water for a short time, 
well drained before using. 

Celery and Chicory. The stalks of these must be 
broken apart, washed and brushed with a vegetable 
brush, and all discolored parts cut out. The stalks 
may remain in water or be wrapped in a damp cloth 
till used. Only the inner stalks of celery are good 
for salads; the outer stalks can be boiled and served, 
with sauce, as a vegetable. 

Radishes. These should be washed, scraped and 
cut in thin slices before being served as a salad. 

All Green Salads should be chilled before serving 
that they may be crisp. When the leaves are too 
large to be served v/hole they should be broken (not 
cut) just before sending them to the table. Add 
dressing to green salads just before eating; if put on 
sooner it softens the leaves and spoils both taste 
and appearance. To make a lettuce salad more sa- 
vory scatter over it before serving a tablespoon of 
finely-chopped chives or, in their season, the same 
quantity of chopped green peppers, removing the 
seeds and white dividing fibre. Peppers and chives 
may be used together if desired. The salad bowl 
may be rubbed with a cut onion, or a few drops of 
onion juice (obtained by pressing a cut onion on a 
grater) can be added to the salad. 



SALADS 75 

In preparing salads from meat and fish an almost 
endless variety of flavors can be obtained by careful 
blending of seasonings to suit the principal ingredi- 
ent of the salad itself. Few better salads can be 
eaten than those made from fragments of cold roast 
lamb cut into dice, mixed with a cup of cooked peas 
and a little finely-chopped mint. If the lamb be 
boiled, substitute a few chopped capers for the mint; 
with cold pork, have a sprinkling of sage and an 
equal quantity of diced celery; with fish, plenty of 
lemon juice and cucumber. These salads are all 
served with a dressing, either French, boiled or mayon- 
naise as best suits the salad and the convenience of 
the maker. 

Fruit Salads are frequently served at luncheon — 
sometimes as a first course — and may be made of 
one fruit or a combination of several; those most 
commonly blended being grapes (skinned and seeded), 
oranges, grape-fruit, bananas and apples. Serve with 
French or mayonnaise dressing. 

The chief rules to be remembered in making salads 
are: 

1. All salads likely to be dry, as well as those having 
no dominating flavor, are better if they are marinated 
with a French dressing some time before serving, in 
addition to the dressing added at table. 

2. It is not enough to wash the salad plants; they 
must be dried also, for the water dripping from the 
leaves in the serving dish would thin the dressing 
and make it insipid. 

3. A good portion of the dressing must be mixed 
with the salad, not all poured over the top.

of French dressing, with it at table.

a bed of lettuce leaves. 



Mayonnaise Dressing 

1 egg yolk. 4 tablespoons lemon juice or 

Yz pint olive oil. vinegar. 

Y2 level teaspoon salt. 
34 level teaspoon paprika or white pepper. 

Break the yolk of the egg into a dry, cold bowl 
and beat a little. At first add the oil to the egg very 
slowly (a few drops at a time), and as the dressing 
begins to thicken, the oil may be added more rapidly 
till, at the last, a teaspoonful at a time may be stirred 
in. The dressing must be stirred while the oil is being 
added, either with a spoon, fork or wire egg beater. 
Add the vinegar slowly, continuing the beating while 
it is being mixed. It is better not to add the salt and 
pepper till the mayonnaise is to be used, because it 
keeps better if the seasoning is omitted. In any case, 
even when the dressing is to be used at once, do not 
add the seasoning till the oil and vinegar, or lemon, are 
added to the egg. 

Tarragon or other flavored vinegars, such as mint 
or sage, may be substituted in whole or in part for the 
plain vinegar or lemon juice. 

Keep mayonnaise in a cool, dark place.

evaporated horseradish. 

Beat the cream till quite thick and then add the 
horseradish finely grated. If evaporated horseradish 
is used, pour over it a tablespoon of cold water and 
allow it to be absorbed before adding to the whipped 
cream. Put in the lemon juice slowly, stirring all 
the time; season to taste, and serve very cold. This 
dressing is especially good with tomatoes.

HARD AND SOFT COOKED EGGS 

10 cook eggs so that they will be firm all the way 
- through and yet not tough or indigestible, put 
them in a saucepan of boiling water, cover closely 
and place on a part of the stove where the water 
will remain very hot, but not boil, and let stand for 
twenty minutes. 

To cook eggs so that they will be soft, follow the 
above directions, but let the eggs remain only ten 
minutes. 

Shirred Eggs 

2 e ggg. 1 level tablespoon butter. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 

Melt the butter in an egg shirrer or any fireproof 
earthen baking-dish; break the eggs into the dish 
and season to taste. Cook in a moderate oven until 
set and serve in the baking-dish. Shirred eggs cook 
very nicely if placed on an asbestos mat on top of 
the range and covered with another mat kept for 
such purposes. This saves heating the oven if there is 
no other baking to be done. A little chopped parsley, 
cheese or a few fried bread crumbs may be sprinkled 
over the eggs before cooking, if desired. 

Poached or Dropped Eggs 

2 eggs. Boiling salted water. 

Buttered toast. 

Have the water boiling in a shallow pan — a frying- 
pan is good, — salt it lightly and drop in the eggs, 
one at a time, having previously broken them into a 
cup to see that they are fresh. Cook till the whites 
are just set, then lift from the water with a skimmer 
and place on the hot buttered toast.

An excellent method of insuring the good shape oi 
the eggs is to grease a muffin ring for each egg to be 
cooked and place in the pan. Drop the egg into the 
ring which can be easily removed when the cooking 
is completed. 

Scrambled Eggs 

6 eggs. 6 tablespoons cream or milk. 

3 level tablespoons butter. % level teaspoon salt. 
Y§ level teaspoon pepper. 

Beat the eggs lightly, whites and yolks together, 
add the seasoning and cream or milk, and place with 
the butter in a saucepan. Stir the mixture constantly 
with a wooden spoon till it begins to thicken, then 
remove the saucepan to a cooler part of the stove 
and continue the cooking till the eggs are set. Serve 
either on buttered toast or garnished with points of 
toast. 

A little grated cheese, a few green peas or mush- 
rooms (cooked), or a few asparagus tips are some- 
times added to the scrambled eggs just before re- 
moving them from the fire.

omelet pan and allow it to become quite hot without 
browning. Pour the eggs into the pan, mix and 
stir them gently till they begin to set. Now push the 
omelet down to one side of the pan that it may be 
thick and puffy, tilting the pan so as to keep it at one 
side. Cook till just set in the centre and golden brown

Orange Omelet 

4 eggs. 2 level tablespoons butter. 

4 tablespoons water. 2 oranges. 

% level teaspoon salt. Sugar to taste. 

Prepare the oranges by removing the skins, every 
particle of white pith, the seeds and as much as 
possible of the inner dividing skin; then cut or 
break into small pieces and add sugar to sweeten. 
This should be done some time before making the 
omelet so that the orange juice and sugar may form 
a syrup. 

Separate the whites from the yolks of the eggs; 
beat first the whites, then the yolks (by beating the 
whites first the same beater will do for both); add 
the salt and water to the yolks, then blend with the 
stiffly-beaten whites. Heat the butter in an omelet 
pan and when hot, but not browned, pour in the 
eggs and cook over a moderate, steady heat till the 
bottom of the omelet is set. This can be ascertained 
by gently inserting a knife between the omelet and the 
pan. As soon as set, place the pan on the upper shelf 
of a fairly hot oven to cook the top. When firm to the 
touch and slightly browned, remove from the oven 
and put a few pieces of the orange on the omelet; 
mark across the centre with a knife, double the two 
sides together quickly and turn or roll onto a hot 
dish. Pour the remainder of the orange around it 
and serve at once, as it soon falls.

into a buttered pudding-dish, and bake in a hot oven 
from twelve to fourteen minutes. 

Serve, as soon as set, in the dish in which it was 
cooked. Do not keep tLe souffle* waiting before serv-

MEMORANDA 



MEMORANDA 



PASTRY 

IN making pastry the best results are obtained by 
having all the ingredients as cold as possible, and 
keeping them so till the pastry goes into the oven. It 
is the sudden change in temperature, as much as 
the actual ingredients used, that makes pastry' light. 
If soft butter and lukewarm water are used the re- 
sult must be poor pastry — tough and not appetizing. 

For plain paste, lard or a mixture of lard and butter 
should be used; for very plain crusts, lard and good 
beef drippings; but for puff paste, butter must be 
used. 

It is often desirable to have pastry that is light, 
flaky and tender without being too rich, and this 
result can be attained by the addition of a little Rum- 
ford Baking Powder and the reduction of the amount 
of fat used. Where a rule calls for one and one-half 
cups of flour and two-thirds of a cup of fat — lard or 
butter — the housekeeper may take half a cup of fat 
and a tcaspoonful of Rum ford Baking Powder to the 
cup and a half of flour, and have equally good results as 
to appearance and flavor, at much less expense. 

All paste is better if chilled before it is baked. If 
convenient it should be made the day before it is to 
be used. 

In making fruit pies always put the sugar with 
the fruit — not on top — or the crust will be soggy. 

A marble or slate pastry-board and a glass or china 
rolling-pin are the best for pastry, because of their 
coldness; but if the ordinary utensils are cold, good 
results will be obtained. 

Short Paste 

3 cups flour. 1 cup lard, or lard and butter. 

1 level teaspoon salt. Ice-cold water to mix — about 

2 level teaspoons Rumford V/z cups.

pose desired. 

Five-minute Paste 

2 cups flour. % cup shortening. 
Yi level teaspoon salt. 1 egg 3 r olk. 

1 level teaspoon Rumford Ice-cold water. 
Baking Powder. 

Sift together the flour, salt and baking powder; then 
cream the shortening in a bowl as for a cake. As soon 
as it is light and creamy, add the sifted flour, mixing it in 
with a knife, not touching at all with the hands. Beat 
the yolk of egg and add a little ice water to it — 
probably about three-quarters of a cup will be required 
— to moisten the paste. Roll out once on a floured 
board. The egg may be omitted, but is an improvement 
if used. 

Flaky Paste 

3 cups flour. \y% cups lard, or butter and 

1 level teaspoon salt. lard. 

Ice-cold water to mix. 

Sift the flour and salt together into a bowl, chop in 
the shortening with a knife till well mixed with the 
flour. Add ice-cold water to form a dough, cutting and 
mixing the paste thoroughly while adding the water. 
Flour a board and roll the paste out thinly, rolling 
only lengthwise, and keeping the edges straight; then 
fold evenly into three layers (lengthwise as a sheet of 
paper would be folded to fit a business envelope), turn 
it half around and roll again. Repeat the folding and 
rolling twice, and chill the paste if possible before 
baking. It is the folding and rolling that produce the 
flakes. 

Puff Paste 

2 cups pastry flour. 1 level teaspoon salt. 
1 cup butter. 1 egg yolk. 

1 tablespoon lemon juice. Ice-cold water. 

Beat the egg and add to it the water and lemon 
juice; sift flour and salt, and mix all these ingredients 
to a firm dough. Roll out into an oblong sheet. Wash 
the butter and press into a flat cake half as large 



PASTRY 107 

as the dough, lay it on one end and cover with the 
paste, like a fruit turnover. Press the edges well 
together, roll out and fold into three layers. Cool 
and roll again, repeating the process till the paste 
has been rolled seven times. Put on ice when neces- 
sary. Bake in a hot oven, and if possible make it the 
day before it is required for use. The butter may 
be divided into three portions and put in after each 
rolling if desired, but the seven rollings must be made 
after all the butter has been used. 

Apple Custard Pie 

3 large tart apples. % pint milk. 

3^ cup sugar. Nutmeg or cinnamon to taste.

add the sugar and spice. Beat the eggs — yolks 
and whites separately, — add the yolks to the milk, 
stir in the flavored apples, and fold into the mixture 
the stiffly-beaten whites of the eggs. Line a deep 
pie plate with paste, pour in the filling, and put strips 
of paste lattice-fashion over the top. Bake in a mod- 
erate oven about half an hour.

or chop it very fine with a knife, and mix all together 
with the sugar, spices, grated lemon rind, apples, salt 
and brandy. Keep at least a week before using, stirring 
occasionally. This quantity will make about eight 
good-sized pies, and will keep all winter.

Boil the water and sugar together, add the corn- 
starch moistened with a little cold water, and cook 
five minutes. Then put in the yolks of the eggs, the 
lemon juice, rind and salt. Cool slightly and pour 
into a previously baked crust. Cover with a meringue 
made by beating the whites of the eggs with the two 
tablespoons of sugar. Put into a moderately warm 
oven to set and brown the meringue. 

The reason so many meringues are failures is be- 
cause they are baked in too hot an oven and conse- 
quently browned before the white of the egg has had 
time to set all the way through.

thick. Cut out with a very small cutter and drop 
into the boiling stew. Cook ten minutes without 
removing the lid of the saucepan. If the lid is lifted 
before the dough is cooked the rush of cold air may 
cause the dumplings to fall. 

Boiled Fruit Dumplings 

Make a dough by the rule previously given for 
Rumford Dumplings, roll as directed, and cut into 
squares of about three inches. Put a spoonful of 
berries, plums or a small pared and cored apple in 
the centre of the dough with sugar to taste. Wet 
and press the edges of the dough firmly over the 
fruit so that they will cling together. Tie each dump- 
ling in a square of cheese cloth and plunge into fast 
boiling water. Cook from half to three-quarters of an 
hour, according to the fruit used. Serve with a hard 
or liquid sauce. 

For baked apple or other fruit dumplings inclose

cream and oyster liquor, stir till boiling and cook 
slowly five minutes longer. Pick over the oysters, 
free them from all bits of shell, scald them in their 
own liquor (if very large divide them), and add to 
the hot sauce, together with the seasonings. Bring 
almost to the boiling point, and fill the shells. Serve 
hot. 

Chicken Patties 

Prepare these the same as Oyster Patties, substi- 
tuting chicken liquor for oyster liquor, and diced 
chicken for the oysters. A little grated lemon rind 
may also be substituted for the lemon juice.

Always sift the flour before measuring 

IN making breads raised with baking powder always 
sift the powder with the dry ingredients to insure 
thorough incorporation and perfect mixing. In mak- 
ing baking powder biscuits, always add enough liquid 
to make a very soft dough, as this is one of the first 
requirements for good biscuits. Have the liquid cold, 
and mix with a flexible knife in preference to hand- 
ling it with either a spoon or the hand, because the 
steel blade is cold, and cuts and mixes more thor- 
oughly. The less biscuits are handled, the better. 
If placed a little apart in the pan they will be lighter 
and more crusty. 

Alwayb add liquid to dry ingredients — they will 
mix more smoothly. The smaller the biscuits and 
muffins, the hotter may be the oven. To obtain a 
brown crust, brush over with milk before baking. 
For a tender crust, brush with melted butter. 

Gems and muffins will be lighter and crisper if 
baked in pans that are hissing hot before the batter 
is placed in them. 

Rumford Biscuit 

2 cups flour. 2 level tablespoons shortening. 

Y> level teaspoon salt. Milk or milk and water to mix 
4 level teaspoons Rumford (about % cup). 

Baking Powder. 

Sift well together the flour, salt and baking pow- 
der; rub in the shortening as lightly as possible with 
the fingers, just working it until the fat is well blended 
with the flour. Then mix to a very soft dough with 
the milk, or milk and water, having this always as 
cold as possible. Mix with a flexible knife in prefer- 
ence to either a spoon or the hand, as the steel blade 
of the knife is colder than the spoon, and also because 
it cuts and mixes the dough more thoroughly. Turn 
the dough onto a well-floured board, and roll or pat 
it with the hand until about three-quarters of an

inch thick. Cut into biscuit and lay them, not touch- 
ing each other, on a baking-pan. Bake in a quick 
oven twelve or fourteen minutes. 

The chief requirements for good biscuit are: 1. A very 
soft dough, so soft as to be almost sticky; 2. Very little 
handling, because much manipulation destroys their 
lightness; 3. A very quick oven. If biscuit are not 
allowed to touch each other in the pan, they will be lighter 
and more delicate than when placed close together.

Yeast Bread 

Yz cake compressed yeast. 1 level teaspoon salt. 

1 level teaspoon sugar. Lukewarm water or milk and 
3 pints sifted flour. water to mix (about 2^ 

1 level tablespoon shortening. cups) . 

Work the yeast and sugar together with the back 
of a teaspoon till they become liquid; add three- 
fourths cup of lukewarm water and a teaspoon of 
flour, and stand aside in a warm place while the flour 
is prepared. 

Sift the flour and salt together into a large bowl 
and rub in the shortening. Make a hollow in the 
centre of the flour, pour in the yeast and add nearly 
the remainder of the lukewarm liquid; knead till a 
soft, elastic dough is formed, using the remainder of 
the liquid if required. The exact quantity of liquid 
can not be given, this depending on the quality of the 
flour. Knead steadily and quickly for twenty minutes, 
working in all the dry flour and adding a little more 
if the dough sticks to the bowl or the hands, but 
avoid adding more than is absolutely necessary. 

Cover the dough with a cloth, stand in a moder- 
ately warm place free from draughts, and let it rise 
till it has doubled its bulk. In the daytime, in a 



124 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

warm kitchen, this will probably be about four hours; 
at night, when the temperature is lower, the bread 
will be ready to mould into loaves early in the morn- 
ing. Should it have risen fully before the cook is 
ready to attend to it, the dough may be " cut down " 
from the sides of the bowl and allowed to come up 
again. This will prevent over-raising, and consequent 
souring. 

In forming into loaves, turn the dough onto a 
lightly-floured board, divide into portions, knead 
slightly and put into greased pans; cover with a cloth 
and allow the dough to double its bulk. 

In baking bread have the oven only moderately 
hot when the bread first goes in so as to allow it to 
rise to its fullest extent; then increase the heat to 
form a good crust, and, finally, reduce it again to 
let the centre of the loaf cook thoroughly. Loaves 
this size require about three-quarters of an hour to 
bake and when done must be removed at once from 
the pans and put where the air will circulate freely 
around them till cold.

desired. This helps to brown the cakes as well as 
sweetens them.

MEMORANDA 



CAKE 

IN cake making, perhaps even more than in any 
other branch of cookery, special attention must 
be paid not only to exact measurements, but to cor- 
rect methods of manipulation. 

Flour, pulverized sugar and similar ingredients 
must all be sifted once before measuring as they 
are liable to "pack" in the sack or barrel in which they 
are kept. Soda, spices and baking powder should be 
stirred lightly before measuring, for the same reason. 

The ingredients used for cake making should always 
be the best obtainable: best tub butter, fresh eggs, 
fine granulated sugar and, preferably, pastry flour, 
if perfect results are to be obtained. Flours vary in 
thickening qualities, therefore the exact amount of 
liquid can not always be stated. 

There are three methods of mixing: stirring, beat- 
ing, and cutting or folding. 

In stirring, the spoon is not lifted from the bowl, 
and the motion may be described as a circular one. 

In beating, the object desired is to get all the air 
possible into the mixture; the faster we beat the 
more air will be incorporated in the batter, and the 
cake in consequence will be lighter; but care must be 
taken that after a cake is beaten, no stirring motion 
is allowed, as this would undo the good already ac- 
complished. 

The term " folding " applies more especially to the 
mixing and blending of the whites of stiffly-beaten 
eggs which are added just before putting the cake 
batter in the pans. The motion is that of lifting the 
batter from the bottom of the bowl, folding it over 
the beaten whites, mixing them in and continuing the 
process till the whites of eggs are no longer seen on 
top of the batter. The whole process must be per- 
formed with great care to avoid destroying the light- 
ness of the air cells in either batter or eggs.

134 KUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

In beating butter and sugar to a cream, never warm 
them nor the bowl,* for if the warming is continued 
a little too long both flavor and texture of the cake 
will suffer. If the butter is very hard and it is not 
convenient to leave it in a warm kitchen to soften 
slowly, a tablespoon of boiling water may be added 
to the butter and sugar in the bowl, to soften the 
butter just enough to make it cream readily. 

If whites and yolks of eggs are separated, add the 
whites, well beaten, just before placing the cake in 
pans. This method makes a lighter, fluffier cake, but 
one which will dry sooner than if the yolks and whites 
are beaten together. 

Fruit should be washed and thoroughly dried before 
being added to cake. 

Most cake requires a moderately hot oven, but 
should not be baked too quickly at first. As soon as 
the cake has risen well the heat may be increased a 
little to give a good crust. Cake is done as soon as it 
shrinks a little from the sides of the pan. Another 
test is to press the centre of the cake with the finger 
and if firm to the touch, it is ready to come out of 
the oven. Testing with a broom straw is also a safe 
rule. If. the straw after having been pressed well 
into the' centre of the cake comes out clean, the cake 
is done. , If sticky, bake a little longer.

ICE CREAM AND ICES 

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR FREEZING 

TO insure good frozen desserts it is necessary to use 
the best ingredients, the ice and salt in the right 
proportions and to freeze at the proper rate of speed. 

Always boil sugar and water together to a syrup for 
water ices, as this melts the sugar thoroughly and 
gives body to the ices. 

When cream is the foundation for the dessert, scald 
it, and add the sugar to the scalding cream. 

When a custard is used as the base of the frozen 
mixture, cook eggs and milk in a double boiler. Do 
not add flavoring till all ingredients are quite cold, as 
extracts are volatile and lose much of their strength 
if added to a hot mixture. 

Genuine Philadelphia Ice Cream is made from 
sweetened and flavored pure cream without the addi- 
tion of eggs or any thickening medium. 

French Ice Cream has a rich custard as its base. 

Punch is a water ice with cordial or other liquor 
added. 

Sherbet is a water ice with or without the addition 
of whites of eggs or dissolved gelatine. 

Mousse and Parfait are cream mixtures frozen with- 
out stirring. 

Have the liquid perfectly cold when put into the 
freezer. 

When fruit is used do not add it till the mixture 
is about half frozen; also be sure that all fruit is thor- 
oughly mashed, or it will freeze too hard. Use about 
one cup of fruit, nuts or macaroons to one quart of 
cream, and allow room for the cream to expand — 
one and one-half pints being sufficient for a quart 
freezer. 

171 



172 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

Crush the ice and mix with the salt before packing 
it around the freezer can. 

For Ice Cream use one part of salt to three parts 
of ice by measure. 

For Mousses and Parfaits, which are not stirred, 
equal measures of ice and salt should be used, as is 
also the case when previously frozen mixtures are 
being moulded. 

For Water Ices two parts of ice to one of salt will 
give the best results. 

In the preparation of ice cream, after the freezer 
can is in place, filled, and the ice and salt packed 
around it, let the mixture stand about five minutes; 
then turn the crank steadily, but not too fast, for the 
first few moments, afterwards increasing the speed 
till the freezing is completed. Then remove the dasher 
and scrape the mixture from the sides of the can, 
packing it down firmly. Replace the top on the can 
and cover with more ice. Put a piece of carpet or 
other heavy material over all, and stand aside for the 
mixture to ripen. 

Vanilla Ice Cream 

1 pint milk. 2 teaspoons vanilla extract. 

3 eggs. yi level teaspoon salt. 

1 cup sugar. 2 cups thin cream. 

Scald the milk, add the well-beaten eggs to it and 
cook in a double boiler till as thick as boiled custard. 
Remove from the fire, add the sugar and, when cold, 
the vanilla, salt and cream. Freeze, and set aside to 
ripen before serving. 

Various additions and flavorings may be added to 
this which may be called a "stock cream"; for ex- 
ample, two squares of chocolate melted over hot 
water may be added to the scalded milk before the 
eggs are put in, to give chocolate cream; or one-half 
cup of coffee may be scalded with the milk and the 
grounds afterwards removed by straining, the eggs 
added and the cream frozen as usual, for coffee ice

cream. Crystallized cherries or ginger may be cut 
in small pieces and added to the cream when it is 
half frozen, when it will be known by the name of the 
fruit added. 

Brown Bread Ice Cream 

This cream may be made by the previous rule, 
adding one cup of brown bread crumbs, dried and 
crushed, to the cream just before putting it into the 
freezer. 

Chocolate Ice Cream 

1 quart thin cream. }4 level teaspoon salt. 

1 cup sugar. 2 squares unsweetened baking 

2 teaspoons vanilla extract. chocolate. 

Scald the cream, add the sugar and let it melt, and 
when the cream is cold add the extract, salt and the 
chocolate, the latter melted by placing it in a cup over 
boiling water. Stir well to blend the ingredients

CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 

THE chief difference between canning and preserv- 
ing is in the amount of sugar used. In canning, 
from one-fourth to one-third is the most common 
quantity; while in jelly making, from three-fourths 
to equal parts may be required, according to the 
acidity of the fruit. 

Canning is the more economical method, and pos- 
sesses the advantage of retaining more nearly the 
fresh flavor of the fruit. With many housekeepers 
the chances that a jar of fruit will keep perfectly, 
or that it will spoil, are about even. Many consider 
it a question of luck, but if fruit is cooked thoroughly, 
placed in sterilized jars and properly sealed, it must 
keep, and can neither mould nor ferment. The jars 
must be free from cracks and used for no other pur- 
pose than canning fruit. The rubbers must be new, 
and sterilized at the same time as the jars; it is not 
economy to use old rubbers. 

To insure success three rules must be followed: 

1. All fruit used, while ripe, must not be over- 
ripe nor at all soft. 

2. Absolute cleanliness must be observed in every- 
thing used for cooking and storing the fruit: have all 
jars, covers, rubbers, spoons, etc., sterilized immedi- 
ately before using. 

3. Cover all jars or glasses while the contents are 
still scalding hot, so that no spores of mould may 
reach the fruit. In the case of jellies, if not conven- 
ient to seal them at once, cover with sheets of glass 
while cooling. 

To sterilize utensils and receptacles used in jelly 
making and canning, wash thoroughly and place in 
a pan, cover with cold water and bring to a fast boiL 
Fill each jar or glass as removed from the boiling 
water without allowing time to cool. 

Jelly bags may be made of cheese cloth, muslin or 
flannel. Before using, wet with cold water, other- 

179 



180 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

wise some juice will be absorbed by the bag and 
wasted. 

Canned fruits are richer if cooked in a syrup in- 
stead of in water to which sugar is added to form a 
syrup after the fruit is cooked. 

TO PREPARE SYRUPS FOR CANNED FRUITS 

For Plums, Peaches, Cherries, Pears, Blackberries 

and other sweet varieties of fruits, use one pound 
of sugar to a quart of water. 

For the more acid fruits, such as currants, sour 
cherries, etc., use one pound of sugar to a pint and 
a half of water. The longer the sugar and water are 
cooked together the heavier the syrup will be. Cook 
without stirring, to prevent crystallizing. 

As a general rule fifteen minutes cooking after 
reaching boiling point will be sufficient to sterilize 
fruits, with the exception of very seedy ones, such 
as currants, which will take a little longer owing to 
the viscous nature of the substance surrounding the 
seeds. 

The Selection of Fruit. Be sure that it has been 
freshly gathered on a dry day and is not over- 
ripe. The finest flavor does not develop till the 
fruit ripens, but the pectin, which is the jellying 
principle, loses some of its properties immediately 
after this stage; therefore, use fruit that is rather 
under than over ripe, especially for jellies and pre- 
serves. 

When washing is necessary place the fruit, a little 
at a time, in a colander and run water gently through 
and over it, draining well afterwards. Peaches can 
be pared without waste by dipping a few at a time 
in boiling water and removing the skin with a sharp 
knife, as one would remove the skin from a tomato. 

To Can Fruit in Jars over the Fire. Fill the jars 
with prepared fruit and place in a steamer or other 
large vessel containing warm water. The jars must 
be protected from the bottom and sides of the vessel 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICKLING 181 

and from each other, either by putting them in a 
rack made for the purpose, or by placing hay, excelsior 
or paper under and around them. Put on the covers 
but do not screw them down. Let the water come 
within four inches of the top of the jars, and cover 
the cooking vessel to prevent the escape of steam. 
Cook for fifteen minutes after reaching boiling point; 
take out the jars, one at a time, fill with boiling sryup, 
seal and cool. Tighten the covers when the fruit is 
cold. 

To Can by the Open Kettle Process. Make a 
syrup of any desired sweetness. If a very rich flavor 
is wanted make the syrup from sugar and extra fruit 
juice instead of sugar and water. Prepare the fruit, 
cook it in the syrup till tender, and then fill and seal 
the sterilized jars as usual. It is the sterilizing, not 
the quantity of sugar used, that insures the keeping 
of fruit. 

To Can without Cooking. This method is suit- 
able for sour fruits such as rhubarb and gooseberries. 
Cut the former into two-inch lengths; top and tail 
the latter. Fill the jars with the fruit and run cold 
water from the faucet into them for ten minutes. 
Seal as usual. The natural acid of the fruit will keep 
it without cooking. 

Always examine the jars carefully before putting 
away, and be sure the covers are screwed as tightly 
as possible. It is a wise precaution to turn each jar 
upside down for a short time. 

As all canned fruits keep better in a dark, cool place, 
an excellent plan is to put each jar into a red or blue 
paper bag which protects it from light. 



JELLY MAKING 

All fruits for jelly making should be gathered just 
before they are fully ripe and on a dry day. Acid 
fruits are most suitable as they contain more pectin 
— the jellying principle — than the sweeter varieties. 



182 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

Strawberries and blackberries are difficult to make 
jelly from without the addition of some other fruit, 
such as apple, currants, etc. 

Currant and Grape Jellies. Pick over the fruit 
carefully and remove all foreign matter; put in a 
preserving kettle and crush to liberate the juice, heat 
till it flows freely, then place in a jelly bag previously 
wrung out of cold water, and let the juice drip slowly. 
It may be left to drip over night. Measure, heat 
to boiling point, add the heated sugar — pound to 
pint — and boil five minutes; skim if necessary, test 
and, if it jellies, pour at once into glasses. Cover 
according to any of the directions given later. 

If a light, delicate color is desired in making cur- 
rant jelly, the stalks must be removed. This takes 
time, but the result warrants it. 

In some cases good jelly can be made by using only 
three-fourths of a pint of sugar to a pint of juice. 
This applies to fruits which contain a large proportion 
of sugar in themselves and also when the season is 
exceptionally dry and sunny. 

Apple, Plum, Crab-Apple or Quince Jelly. Wash, 
wipe and stem, and from apples, crab-apples and 
quinces remove the blossom; quinces need hard rub- 
bing to remove the fuzz; from plums remove the stones. 
Cut all fruits into convenient-sized pieces, using a 
silver knife to prevent discoloration, and add water — 
for apples and crab-apples half as much water as fruit; 
for the other kinds of fruit use a little less water as 
they have more juice of their own. Cook until tender 
and strain through a jelly bag. Measure the juice 
and add the sugar, pound to pint, unless the fruit is 
very sweet, when a little less should be used; cook till 
the juice jellies when a little is cooled in a saucer; 
then put into glasses, and cover. It must be remem- 
bered that too long boiling destroys the jellying prin- 
ciple; consequently the fruit must not be allowed to 
cook longer than necessary. 

If the sugar is heated after measuring, the jelly will 
be clearer and jell more quickly. The heating can be 



CANNING, PRESERVING AND PICEXING 183 

done while the fruit juice is coming to the boiling 
point. 

Jellies made by the Cold Process are the most deli- 
cate, but are not likely to keep quite as well as when 
fruit juice and sugar are cooked together. The method 
followed is the same as for ordinary jelly so far as 
the cooking, straining and measuring of the fruit 
and juice are concerned. The sugar — pound for pint 
— is added to the strained juice and dissolved; the 
sterilized glasses filled, and covered with sheets of 
glass to keep out the dust and attract the rays of the 
sun, and the jellies left in a sunny place till set. They 
are then covered according to directions given. 

TO COVER JELLIES 

There are three methods in common use: 

1. Dip a round of paper in either alcohol or brandy, 
lay it on top of the jelly as soon as it is cold and then 
put the tin cover of the glass over the top. 

2. Dip a round of paper in slightly-beaten white of 
egg, cover the glass with this and press down till the 
paper adheres closely. The paper must be large 
enough to overlap the top of the glass at least half 
an inch on all sides. 

3. Cover the jelly, when cold, with melted paraffin e 
wax, having the wax quarter of an inch thick as it 
contracts when cold, and if too thin a portion of the 
jelly will be left uncovered. 

Preserved Rhubarb 

6 pounds rhubarb. Rind of 1 lemon, or 1 ounce 

4 pounds sugar. whole ginger, if desired. 

Make a syrup of the sugar with just enough water 
to prevent burning and add the lemon, or ginger if 
used. Cut the rhubarb into two-inch lengths and 
cook in the syrup gently to prevent breaking. It is 
better to cook a small quantity at a time. Place the 
fruit in jars as soon as tender; boil the syrup rapidly 
till it is thick, pour over the fruit, and seal.

RECIPES FOR THE CHAFING-DISH 

THE chafing-dish affords a means of preparing 
on the serving table,- at the time of eating, 
small dishes which do not need very long cooking. 
Alcohol or gas may be employed as the fuel, but the 
former is generally used. Proof alcohol is best as it 
gives greater heat and burns longer than wood al- 
cohol. All good chafing-dishes have two pans, the 
blazer and the hot-water pan. With dishes contain- 
ing eggs, and those requiring slow cooking, use both 
pans. Such preparations as will not be harmed by 
close contact with the flame may be cooked without 
the water pan. 

The lamp may be adjusted to give either a moder- 
ate or quick heat. In preparing to use a chafing- 
dish at table be sure that all ingredients, seasoning, 
etc., are at hand that no time may be wasted when 
the lamp is lighted. Have a tray under the dish in 
case water or alcohol overflows. 

All dishes that can be cooked in a short time in a 
frying-pan or saucepan are suitable for the chafing- 
dish, and all recipes given under this heading can be 
cooked over the fire. Frying-pans, toasters and many 
accessories can be obtained for use with the chafing- 
dish.

SANDWICHES 

BREAD for sandwiches should be not less than 
twelve hours old, rather close grained and of 
such shape as to cut without waste, the regular sand- 
wich loaves being the best for the purpose. 

The butter should be sufficiently soft to spread 
easily, and is better creamed as for cake. Season- 
ings can be sometimes beaten into the butter, thus 
saving labor in^spreading. The bread may be spread 
with butter either before or after cutting from the 
loaf. Be sure that the slices are kept in the order of 
slicing that they may fit together after filling. 

Cheese and Green Pepper Sandwiches 

Y 2 pound cheese. Salt. 

3 green peppers. Slices of bread. 

Remove the seeds and white pith and pass the 
peppers through a meat chopper with the cheese, 
season to taste, and mix smoothly. The juice from 
the peppers will moisten the cheese sufficiently for it 
to spread easily. Have the bread cut rather thicker 
than usual for sandwiches. Spread the cheese paste 
rather thickly on one slice of bread and cover with 
another; press together firmly and toast over a hot 
fire. Cut into strips and tuck between the folds of a 
napkin to keep them hot.

put in the tea, and pour on boiling water in the pro- 
portion given. Cover, and keep in a warm place, 
but where the tea will not boil, for three to five min- 
utes to " draw." If it can not be used at once pour off 
the tea and discard the leaves. An earthen teapot

Iced tea is made the same as the hot beverage and 
may be prepared some hours before using, the in- 
fusion being poured off the leaves as soon as the 
strength is extracted, then cooled, and placed near 
the ice till required for use; or, the tea may be made 
at the time of serving and chilled by the plentiful 
addition of cracked ice. The former is the most 
economical method. Iced tea should be taken clear 
and weaker than when served hot, and slices of lemon 
should be passed witl? it.

RECIPES FOR THE SICK 

THE food eaten by a sick person has in many 
cases as much to do with rapid recovery as 
have drugs. It must be remembered that the palate 
is more sensitive in sickness than in health, both to 
seasonings and temperatures, so that less seasoning 
and more moderate degrees of heat and cold must be 
observed. 

Daintiness in serving greatly influences the appe- 
tite of the patient, and, therefore, for this reason it is 
preferable to serve small portions and present the 
meal by courses rather than place all on the tray at 
one time. Have all hot beverages brought to the door 
of the sick room in a covered pitcher, then poured into 
the cup, thus avoiding the danger of spilling liquids 
into the saucer while carrying them to the patient. 

Food should not be kept in the sick room between 
meals. It will be fresher and more appetizing if 
brought direct from storeroom or refrigerator when 
wanted. 

When liquid foods are given, other receptacles than 
those for medicine should be used, as the association 
of the two is oftentimes unpleasant. When the diet- 
ary is limited, serve the foods that are permitted, 
in as many forms as possible to avoid sameness. For 
instance, beef tea may be given hot in the form of 
beef essence — as savory jelly, frozen, and as beef 
tea custard; practically the same food but more pala- 
table because served in different forms. 

Be very careful to keep such foods as milk, beef 
tea, etc., covered while in the refrigerator, to avoid 
contact with other or more odorous foods. If the 
refrigerator has more than one compartment reserve 
one exclusively for the use of the sick room.

or sweetened as preferred. 



To Sterilize Milk 

Pour fresh milk into small bottles, filling them 
almost full. Put absorbent cotton in the necks in- 
stead of corks, and place the bottles in a saucepan 
containing sufficient cold water to almost fill the pan; 
bring nearly to boiling point and let the bottles remain 
in the water fifteen minutes. Then remove and cool. 



Wine Whey 
1 cup milk. }/2 cup sherry or port wine. 

Boil the milk, add the wine and remove from the 
fire at once. Let stand till the curd is separated from 
the whey, then strain through a fine cloth and serve 
as it is, or reheat.

2 teaspoons sugar. Phosphate. 

Heat the milk in a small saucepan over hot water 
or in a double boiler; add the Acid Phosphate and 
cook, without stirring, until the whey separates. 
Strain through cheese cloth and add the sugar. If 
more acid is desired, add two or three drops of Hors- 
ford's Acid Phosphate. Serve hot or cold. 



Beef and Sago Broth 

Yz pound round steak or 3 level teaspoons sago. 

shin of beef. 1 egg yolk. 

1 pint water. Salt. 

Cut the beef into small pieces, add the water and 
let stand for half an hour; then cook in a double 
boiler two hours; strain, and press as much as possible 
of the meat pulp through a sieve. Add the sago, 
return to the saucepan and cook half an hour longer. 
Season and pour the broth over the yolk of the egg 
which has been lightly beaten. Serve at once. 



Invalid's Tea 

1 level teaspoon tea. 1 cup scalded milk. 

Sugar to taste. 

Bring the milk quickly to the scalding point and 
pour it over the tea. Let the two infuse four minutes, 
strain, and serve with or without sugar. Tea made 
by this method nourishes as well as stimulates.

the clams, chop and return them to the sauoepan with 
the water. Cook ten minutes, strain, and add the 
remaining water if necessary to reduce the strength 
of the broth. Season and serve. 

Beef Juice 

Y 2 pound top round of beef. Pinch of salt. 

Broil the meat for about two minutes to " start " 
the juice, then press all the liquid from it with a meat 
press or an old-fashioned wooden lemon squeezer. 
Turn into a warm cup, or colored glass to disguise the 
color; add salt to taste, and serve. As this will not 
keep it must be prepared fresh for each serving. 

Beef Tea 

Y2 pound round steak. Y2 pint water. 

Yz level teaspoon salt. 

Cut the meat in small pieces, the smaller it is cut 
the more easily it will give off its juices, or scrape it 
from the fibre. Add the cold water and stand aside 
for half an hour. Then place in a Mason jar, cover 
and stand in a saucepan of cold water; let it heat 
slowly to about 140 degrees and cook two hours; 
strain and season. It is better to have the jar raised 
from the bottom of the saucepan, that it may not 
come in too close contact with the heat of the range. 
Beef tea may be served hot, frozen, or in the form of 
a jelly, the latter consistency being obtained by the 
addition of one scant teaspoon of granulated gelatine 
soaked five minutes in a tablespoon of cold water and 
added to the beef tea as soon as the latter is strained. 
Stand in a cool place until set. 

Oatmeal Gruel 

1 cup water or milk. 2 level tablespoons oatmeal or 

34 level teaspoon salt. rolled oats. 

Have the water or milk actively boiling, shake the 
oats into it and cook fifteen minutes. Then place 



226 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

over hot water (a double boiler is best) and cook one 
hour. If the gruel is made with milk add the salt 
just before serving; with water, it may be put in 
earlier. Strain if desired to remove the particles of 
oats. 



Corn Meal Gruel 

1)4, cups water. 2 level tablespoons corn meal. 

}i level teaspoon salt. 

Have the water salted and actively boiling, shake 
the meal gently into it and cook twenty minutes,

1 level tablespoon arrow- y± level teaspoon salt. 

root. 2 tablespoons brandy or wine. 

1 cup milk. A very little sugar if desired. 

Mix the arrowroot smoothly with a little of the 
milk, heat the remainder and, when boiling, put in 
the arrowroot and cook gently for ten minutes; add 
salt and sugar and, at the moment of serving, the 
brandy or wine. Arrowroot contains little nutri- 
ment, but is useful as a vehicle for the serving of 
stimulants. 



Irish Moss 

1 small handful Irish moss. }4 teaspoon vanilla or other 
3 cups milk. flavoring. 

1 level tablespoon sugar. 

Wash and pick over the moss carefully, add it to 
the milk in a saucepan, and simmer the two till the 
moss begins to dissolve. A double boiler is prefer- 
able as it prevents too rapid cooking. In about twenty 
minutes, if the moss is dissolving, strain through 
cheese cloth, add sugar and flavoring, and turn into

or stock hot and pour it over the eggs. Strain into 
greased cups or small moulds, and cover each with 
greased paper. Stand the moulds in a vessel of hot 
water and cook gently, either in the oven or over the 
fire, till the custard is set. As soon as a knife blade 
inserted in the custard comes out clean (not milky 
looking) remove from the fire. Unmould and serve 
hot or cold. Do not let the water surrounding the 
moulds boil or the custard will be honeycombed and 
less digestible. 

Puffed Egg 
1 egg. Pinch of salt. 

Separate the yolk from the white of the egg and 
beat the latter to a stiff froth, adding the salt. Turn 
into a cup and place in a steamer or vessel containing 
enough water to come halfway up the sides of the 
cup. Steam three minutes and if at the end of that 
time it is puffy looking, drop the unbroken yolk into 
the centre of the white, replace the cover of the pan 
and cook till the yolk is nearly set. Serve in the cup 
in which it is cooked.

MEMORANDA 



MEMORANDA 



CARVING 

THREE things are essential to good carving: first, 
a knowledge of the anatomy of the fish, fowl 
or joint to be served; second, a sharp carving knife; 
and, third, an acquaintance with the choice portions 
of the particular dish which is to be served. 

FISH 

In serving fish be careful not to break the flakes. 
With such fish as haddock, cod, flounder, etc., run 
the knife down the full length of the back fin to sepa- 
rate the flesh from the bone. Portions can be then 
divided easily. 

With salmon be sure to serve a little of the thick 
and a little of the thin flesh to each person. The 
middle of a fish is usually the choicest in flavor, the 
tail part the most insipid. 

When such fish as flounder or sole are fried it is 
wiser to fillet them — that is, remove the bone — 
before frying, as they are easier to serve when so 
prepared. 

MEATS 

Such joints as require it, from their lack of compact 
form, should be either tied, skewered or sewed into 
shape before cooking. When tying use white string; 
when skewering use steel skewers in preference to 
wooden ones, and when sewing use a trussing needle 
threaded with fine white string. Either method of 
securing the meat may be employed by the cook. 

Serve gravy in a separate vessel from the meat, 
that the carver may work more easily. 

Rib Roast. When the bone is left in, cut the 
meat in long, thin slices from the thin to the thick 
end of the meat. The thick, round muscle is the 

233 



234 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

choice portion of the roast, the meat at the thin end 
being more or less tough as well as containing an 
excessive proportion of fat. It is wiser to remove 
the greater part of this thin end and cook it in some 
other form than roast, where it can be used to greater 
advantage. 

When the bone has been removed from a rib roast 
and the meat tied, skewered or sewed into shape, 
thin slices are to be cut across the upper surface of 
the meat. The skewers or tie threads must be left in 
place till the meat is cold so that it will retain its 
shape. 

Sirloin or Porterhouse Steak. First insert the knife 
close to the bone and cut the meat away from 
it. Serve to each person a portion of the tenderloin 
and a portion of the meat from the upper side of the 
bone. 

Round Steak. Cut in thin strips across the grain 
of the meat. This rule of cutting across the grain, 
instead of with it, holds good in the carving of all 
joints, whether roasts, pot-roasts, corned beef, beef 
a la mode or fresh boiled beef. 

Fresh or Salt Ham. Cut in very thin, rather slant- 
ing slices, beginning near the narrow end of the joint. 
In this way fat and lean are more evenly distributed. 

Tongue. If rolled, cut off the top slice and set it 
aside; then cut thin, even slices across the meat. If 
the tongue is not rolled, cut slices from the thicker 
portion of the meat, discarding the tip as this is dry 
and can be used to good advantage for potting or for 
sandwiches. 

Leg of Lamb or Mutton. Have the fleshy side of 
the meat uppermost, and cut even slices down to the 
bone, beginning the carving about the middle of the 
leg and cutting towards the thick end of the joint. 
If the leg has been cut large, so that there are some 
of the chops with it (at the thick end) see that these 
are well cracked through the bones before cooking, 



CARVING 235 

The chops are better served while the roast is hot, 
as the meat is drier when cold than the more fleshy 
part in the middle of the joint. 

Loin of Lamb or Pork. Be very] sure that the joints 
are well cracked, otherwise the meat can not be served 
neatly. Cut from the thin to the thick edge, having 
one rib bone in each slice of meat. 

Crown Roast of Lamb is carved in the same man- 
ner as the loin, one bone to a slice, cutting from top 
to bottom of the meat. 



POULTRY 

Roast Fowl. First remove the leg, then the wing, 
and next the side bones. Cut thin slices from the 
breast, running from the head toward the tail. Cut 
off the wishbone and make a crosswise incision in 
the body of the bird for the removal of the dressing 
if this is used. If the tendons have been removed 
from the leg before cooking, this portion should be as 
tender as any other. Unless this has been done it 
is better to leave these joints to be made tender by 
further cooking. 

Boiled Fowl is carved in the same manner, except 
that the breast is usually cut in thicker slices, and 
no dressing is served. 

Broiled Chicken. Split down the back before cook- 
ing, and at serving time cut lengthwise through the 
breastbone, then, if large, into quarters, cutting across 
the breastbone. If the chicken is small, serve half 
to each person. 

Duck and Goose. These are carved in almost the 
same manner as fowl; the breast, however, is not 
so thick, and the leg and wing joints lie somewhat 
closer to the body. The breast and wings of these 
birds are the choicest portions, the legs being gener- 
ally reserved and deviled, or reheated in some other 
way. It is generally considered that the leg of a flying 



236 RUMFORD COMPLETE COOK BOOK 

bird and the wing of a swimmer are, with the breast, 
the choicest portions. 

TO BONE A FOWL 

Wash and singe the bird, but do not draw it. 
Take a very sharp pointed knife and cut through 
skin and flesh the whole length of the back; then cut 
the flesh away from the bones, beginning at the neck, 
scraping all the meat from each bone as the work pro- 
ceeds. On reaching the wings, cut them off close to 
the body, and after the meat is all cut from the car- 
cass of the bird, the leg and wing bones can be more 
easily removed. These joints can be practically 
turned inside out, thus making the shape of the bird 
more symmetrical for stuffing and cooking. In boning, 
great precaution should be taken against breaking the 
skin, especially that of the breast. After boning, birds 
are stuffed with a savory dressing, the flesh sewed or 
tied in place over the stuffing, and either roasted or 
braised.

Incorporated 1859 Cable Address " Rumford " 

Organized especially for manufacture of the culi- 
nary phosphate preparations invented by the late 
Prof. E. N. Horsford, one of the founders of the com- 
pany, who, at the time, occupied the chair in Harvard 
University endowed by the famous domestic economist, 
Count Rumford, and known as "the Rumford Pro- 
fessorship." From this relationship the title of the 
corporation was derived, this in turn giving the name 
Rumford to the thriving post-office village which has 
grown up about its principal manufacturing establish- 
ment, four miles from Providence on the New York, 
New Haven & Hartford Railroad. 

Here are located the chemical factories with their 
interdependencies of repair shop, carpenter shop, ma- 
chine shops, cooper shop, harness shop, one of the 
laboratories, etc., in fact all the necessary adjuncts that 
go to make up a great manufacturing enterprise of this 
kind. Here also has been established a library for the 
free use of the employees. 

The main offices, packing department, printing 
and binding departments (producing labels, circulars, 
pamphlets, etc., used in the business), the principal 
and research laboratories, with other departments, 
occupy buildings owned by the company covering 
more than an entire square in the City of Provi- 
dence, Rhode Island.
