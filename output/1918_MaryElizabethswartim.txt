PREFACE 

In the early days of the war, I came away 
from a talk with Mr. Hoover and Dr. Taylor 
of the Department of Agriculture, convinced 
that unless I could make candy without sugar 
and cake, and bread without wheat, I was daily 
depriving our suffering Allies and our Soldiers 
of food they sorely needed — Soldiers do not 
fight well if underfed, nor have they good 
morale if their families at home are hungry. 
So it seemed to me that women's first war ac- 
tivity should be to cooperate fully with the 
Food Administration ; and I then and there de- 
termined that I would sell and serve in my 
shops only foods that entirely conformed to 
the requirements of the United States Food 
Administration. It has meant a good deal of 
very interesting work, but the results have far 
exceeded my hopes, and all these recipes are 
now in daily use in my shops. 

My opportunities for testing recipes are 
many times greater than those of most women, 
and war time foods that my patrons will order 



vi PREFACE 

and enjoy must possess qualities of merit. 
The requests for my war time recipes have 
been so abundant that I am gathering these 
recipes together in book form, that they may 
help some folks who have the same earnest 
desire as myself to aid the Food Administra- 
tion in every way but lack the facilities and 
time to work out their own recipes. 

The Food Administration's rulings will 
change from time to time, along with crop and 
other conditions ; but the need for wheat, meat, 
and sugar conservation — except perhaps for 
short periods — will continue as long as the 
wheat and beet sugar fields of Europe remain 
battle fields and men, who might be raising 
crops and animals for food, are soldiers. 

Fish and poultry, fresh vegetables and 
fruits that grow nearby (foods that must be 
carried a long distance by our already over- 
burdened railroads must be used as little as 
possible) should form the greater part of our 
diet, and can do so with no sense of depriva- 
tion if a little added care and attention be given 
to menu-making and cookery. 

Mary Elizabeth.

SUGARLESS CANDIES 



All these candies are made without cane sugar; 
honey, maple sugar and fruits being the only sweet- 
ener. One may eat all this sort of candy one wishes 
without depriving our Soldiers or Allies of sugar.' 

Most of these candy recipes require a thermom- 
eter test. (A confectioners' thermometer can be 
had at any optical shop — costing about $1.50.) 



CHAPTER I 

SUGARLESS CANDIES 

MAPLE SUGAR CARAMELS 

1 lb. (two cupfuls) maple sugar 
1% lbs. (one and one-half cupfuls) corn syrup 
1 qt. (four cupfuls) sweet cream 
1 can best brand condensed milk 

Stir continuously while cooking, and cook 
to 240 degrees by the thermometer in winter; 
242 degrees by the thermometer in summer. 

Pour into an oiled oblong cake-tin to cool. 

Turn pan upside down on a cutting board 
and let the caramel fall out. Then cut first 
into strips, then into squares with a large sharp 
knife. 

If the caramels are not to be used at once, 
wrap them in oiled paper. 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 



FIG WALNUTS 

Wash a few layer figs, removing the stem 
of each one, and place them in a sieve, over a 
kettle of boiling water. Cover tightly and let 
them steam for five minutes. 

Crack walnuts, so as to remove the meats 
whole, by striking the - nut on the smooth side. 

When the figs are cool enough to handle, 
put through a meat grinder or chop very fine 
in a chopping bowl. Form the chopped figs 
into small balls (a little sherry may be mixed 
in if desired) and place a walnut meat on each 
side. 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 



MAPLE BONBONS 

Boil a quart of the finest maple syrup, re- 
moving from the fire when the thermometer 
registers 234 degrees. Stir continuously until 
it becomes quite firm and creamy. 

Drop from a spoon on waxed paper, and 
press a pecan meat on the top of each ball. 



6 SUGARLESS CANDIES 

HONEY COCOANUT FRUIT 
SQUARES 

Cover one-half pound of desiccated cocoa- 
nut with fresh milk and let it stand for a few 
moments. 

Cook one pound of strained honey until it 
comes to a good boil; add the coeoanut and 
cook all until it will drop from a spoon in a 
thick string. 

Stir in one-fourth cup of washed currants 
and pour into an oiled tin. 

When cold, cut into inch squares. 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 



PECAN PATTIES 

Cook one quart of maple syrup until the 
thermometer registers 249 degrees. Add one- 
fourth pound of butter. 

Remove from fire and stir in one and one- 
half cups of pecan meats. 

Spoon out into oiled patty tins or muffin 
rings, and wrap each patty in oiled paper when 
cold. 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 



STUFFED CARAMELS 

For the caramel, use the Maple Sugar Cara- 
mel recipe and leave the caramel uncut. 



MAPLE FONDANT 

Cook one quart of maple syrup until the 
thermometer registers 241 degrees. Wipe 
away any grains that form on the sides of the 
saucepan while the syrup is cooking; do this 
with dampened cheese-cloth wrapped round a 
fork. 

When thermometer registers 241 degrees, 
remove at once from the fire and pour on to a 
platter, which should be as cold as possible and 
slightly dampened (do not oil). 

As soon as the first heat has passed, begin 
beating with a fork and continue so to beat and 
mix until the fondant becomes too hard to mix 
with the fork.

STUFFED CARAMELS 




STUFFED CARAMELS 



SUGAELESS CANDIES 9 

Then press all together by hand and cover 
with a damp cheese-cloth for about ten 
minutes. 

Turn the pan of cold maple caramel upside 
down on a kneading-board and remove the 
tin. 

Knead well some of the maple fondant and 
roll into a piece as long as the maple caramel 
and about two inches in diameter. Lay on the 
caramel and fold the caramel around it as 
illustrated. 

Pinch firmly where the two edges come 
together, and let all stand, seam edge down, 
for a few moments, to seal it together. Then 
gently stretch one end, a little at a time, into 
a long neck; cut off into small pieces with a 
sharp knife, as illustrated. 

If the caramels are not to be eaten at once, 
wrap each one in waxed paper. 

Maple fondant may be made on a large plat- 
ter — if not more than a pound and a half is 
desired. In quantities larger than this and up 
to five pounds (more than five pounds at a 



10 SUGARLESS CANDIES 

time is too difficult to beat) a marble slab or 
table-top should be used to pour the cooked 
syrup on, and to beat it into a cream. 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 11 



HONEY CORN BALLS 

Pop one and one-half pounds of the best 
popping corn. Sort or sift out any unpopped 
kernels and put in the oven to keep warm. 

Cook two pounds of strained honey until the 
candy thermometer registers 240 degrees. 

Add butter the size of a walnut and cook to 
242 degrees. 

Pour a small quantity on to the popped corn 
and mold what is moist into firm balls ; then add 
more syrup and mold until all is used. 

This quantity will make about twenty large 
balls. 



12 SUGARLESS CANDIES 



MAPLE OPERA CARAMELS 

1% lbs. maple sugar 
1 pint cream 
Pinch of salt 

Cook to 238 degrees. 

Pour on to a cold y damp platter and beat 
with a fork until creamy. 

When perfectly smooth, press into a fudge 
pan and cut into squares. 



SUGARLESS CANDIES IS 



TUTTI-FRUTTI BALLS 

% lb. washed figs 

y<2, lb. raisins (seeded) 

y 2 lb. dates (pitted) 

A little candied citron 

% lb. chopped roasted hazelnut meats 

Steam the above fruits for ten minutes, or 
until they are soft and tender. 

When cool, put through a meat chopper — 
first a few, adding two tablespoonfuls of 
brandy. 

Mix in the nut meats and mold into little 
balls. 



14 SUGARLESS CANDIES 



RICE CRACKLE 

Warm contents of one package of puffed 
rice in the oven, stirring constantly until it is 
thoroughly dry and crisp. 

Cook one pint of strained honey till the ther- 
mometer registers 240 degrees. Add a piece 
of butter the size of a walnut and a pinch of 
salt. 

Cook to 242 degrees, and pour onto the 
warm rice. Mix well and fill into square but- 
tered cake tins — pressing out the top smoothly 
with a rolling-pin. The cake tin should be 
full to the top. 

While still warm, turn the pan upside down. 
Remove the rice cake and cut with a large 
sharp knife into pieces about five inches long 
and two inches wide. 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 15 



SOFT MAPLE SCOTCH 

2% lbs. crushed maple sugar 
1 pint water 
Pinch of salt 

Stir until the sugar is dissolved; then put in 
thermometer and cook to 256 degrees. 

Add one-fourth pound of butter; mix in 
lightly and pour into oiled tins. 

When cold, cut into oblong pieces and wrap 
in waxed paper. 



16 SUGARLESS CANDIES 

HONEY NOUGAT 

Nougat is made in two batches. The first 
one can be made the day before the other, or 
a double batch can be made and half of it be 
kept on hand in an air-tight Mason jar to be 
used later. 

First batch: Cook one and one-half pounds 
(two cupfuls) of corn syrup to 230 degrees by 
the thermometer. Add one-quarter pound of 
XXXX sugar, and pour all slowly on to the 
well-beaten whites of two eggs. Then add, a 
little at a time, beating constantly, one-half 
ounce of powdered gum arabic and one-fourth 
ounce of pulverized gelatin, dissolved in a lit- 
tle water. 

Second batch: Blanch one pound of almonds 
and one-half pound of pistachio nuts, and put 
in warming oven to dry out thoroughly. Line 
a pan with rice- wafer paper; use a little water 
to wet the edges so they will stick together; 
have the entire pan sides as well as the bottom 
covered. 

Cook one pound (one and one-quarter cup- 
fuls) strained honey, one and one-half pounds 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 17 

(three cupfuls) shaved maple sugar, one pound 
(three-quarters cupful) corn syrup, one ounce 
cocoa hutter, and one-half pint (one cupful) 
water to 268 degrees by the thermometer. 

Pour this batch slowly into batch number 
one, beating constantly. When all this syrup 
is added, put in the blanched nuts, mixing well. 

Pour the nougat into the wafer-lined pan 
and cover the top with rice-paper. Put a sheet 
of heavy wax-paper on top of all and weight 
the nougat with one or two flatirons. 

When cold, remove flatirons, turn pan up- 
side-down, and cut with a sharp caramel knife. 

Wrap each piece in wax-paper. 

The rice-paper is edible and wholesome and 
need not be removed. It can be bought at a 
confectioners' supply store. One can use the 
small rice-wafers, which are on sale for gold- 
fish food, if larger sheets are not easily found, 
as it is the same thing; but the larger sheets 
are the more practical. 



18 SUGARLESS CANDIES 

COCOANUT MAPLE CREAMS 

1% pounds (three cupfuls) maple sugar 
1 can (& cups) fresh grated cocoanut 
% cupful water 

Drain milk from the cocoanut and add 
to milk enough water to make one-half pint 
(one cupful) of liquid. Mix with sugar. Put 
on fire and stir until sugar is dissolved — no 
longer. 

Cook to 238 degrees by the thermometer and 
add the drained cocoanut. 

Cook to 240 degrees. Pour on to a cold, 
damp platter, and mix with a fork. 

When done, put in a double boiler, mixing 
constantly until all is melted, and drop in 
spoonfuls on waxed paper.

1 onion (chopped) 
1 green pepper (chopped) 
1 tablespoon barley 

1 tablespoon oatmeal 

2 tomatoes (cut) 
About 12 okra 

Season with salt, pepper and paprika. Boil 
slowly for two to three hours. 

Serve with croutons made from bread crusts 
cut in tiny cubes and browned in the oven. 

Pass grated cheese with this soup.

22 ' SOUPS 



PUREE OF BLACK BEAN 

One pound of dried black beans; wash and 
soak overnight. Take two quarts of water, 
two quarts of soup stock, one-half teaspoonful 
of soda, one bay leaf, a few celery tops, two 
carrots, two small onions, one-fourth teaspoon- 
ful of pepper, one tablespoonf ul of salt. Cook 
about three hours, then mash through a strainer 
and serve with a slice of lemon floating on each 
cup or plate of soup, or a dash of chopped 
egg yolks and whites. 

Puree of black bean is a war time recipe, be- 
cause beans contain a great deal of nutriment 
and make a meat substitute. We must save 
beef for our soldiers and Allies, and each time 
we substitute vegetable soups for meat soups, 
we are conserving meats. 



SOUPS 23 

CREAM OF TOMATO AND PEA 

1 pint tomatoes (either fresh or canned) 
% pound peas (dried) 
1 onion 
Celery tops 

Use the yellow split peas ; soak overnight. 

Cook the peas in one pint of water, one pint 
of tomatoes, with onion and one or two celery 
tops, until peas are tender ; then mash through 
a sieve and strain. Season with salt and pep- 
per. 

A spoonful of sherry to each plate of soup is 
an addition and should be added just before 
serving. 

Garnish with a slice of tomato with a few 
peas on top, and then serve with bread crou- 
tons, which can be cut from any crusts or good 
pieces of left-over bread — cut in even tiny 
squares and browned in the oven. 



24 SOUPS 



JELLIED ESSENCE OF CELERY

MEATLESS RECIPES 



VEGETABLE STEW WITH 
DUMPLINGS 

6 potatoes 
6 carrots 

1 small turnip 

2 onions 

2 parsnips 

Scoup the vegetables into balls with a po- 
tato scoup, and boil until tender. Take the 
water that vegetables have been boiled in and 
add three tablespoonfuls of corn flour, and one 
pint of chicken or meat stock — for flavor — and 
put the cooked vegetables in. Cook this about 
ten minutes. 

Add the dumplings last, made as follows:

36 MEATLESS RECIPES 



DUMPLINGS 

1 cup mashed potato 

1 cup rice flour 

1 teaspoon salt 

1 heaping tahlespoon baking powder 

2 tablespoons vegetable fat 

1 egg 

1 cup milk 

Rub the salt, baking powder, flour and vege- 
table fat together. Beat the one egg and one 
cup of milk together, and add lastly to the mix- 
ture. Drop from a tablespoon into two quarts 
of salted boiling water and cook ten minutes. 
Serve immediately. 

The water in which the dumplings have been 
cooked will be found to be thick and flavory. 
It can be used in any cream soup for thick- 
ening or for cream sauce. A very nice onion 
soup can be made from this thickened water by 
adding a quart of milk, a grated onion, and salt 
and pepper.

Boil until clear, and add the grapes (whole). 
Boil four minutes. 

Split and broil a three- to four-pound fresh 
mackerel over a hot fire; broil about twenty 
minutes until brown, turning frequently. Sea- 
son with salt, pepper, and butter. 

Fish is a meat substitute ; fruit, a perishable 
food; arrowroot is used for thickening instead 
of wheat flour; honey for sweetening instead 
of sugar — a perfect war time recipe.

FINNAN HADDIE— CUCUMBERS 
AND POTATOES 

Finnan Haddie is particularly nutritive, and 
in these days when we are forbidden ham and 
bacon, such salty things as this are most ac- 
ceptable. 

Wash the fish first ; then boil for a few min- 
utes, removing any skum from the top of the 
water, before removing the fish. 

Peel the cucumbers and cut into two-inch 
pieces. Boil in salt water about ten minutes. 

Cut potatoes in balls with potato cutter, and 
boil in salt water until tender. 

Make a cream sauce of two tablespoonfuls 
of corn flour, mixed with one tablespoonful of 
melted butter ; stir till melted and thoroughly 
mixed, then add one pint of milk slowly, and 
cook till thick; season with salt and pepper and 
a dash of celery salt. 

Put the cream sauce on a platter; then the 
fish, surrounded by the cucumbers and pota- 
toes, and serve hot.

FRIED OYSTERS (COOKED IN 
THE OVEN)— TARTAR SAUCE 

Roll each oyster in corn flour seasoned with 
salt and pepper; dip in beaten egg; then roll 
in bread crumbs. Brush with vegetable oil, 
and bake in a hot oven till light brown. 

Serve with tartar sauce, which is made by- 
adding chopped olives, dill pickles, parsley and 
capers to mayonnaise. (See Chapter IV for 
mayonnaise recipe.) 

By cooking oysters or any fried foods in 
this way, one conserves a good deal of fat, and 
they are even more delicious and more digest- 
ible than the old way.

BROILED BLUEFISH— CUCUMBER 
JELLY 

Make the jelly — using one quart of water, 
one teaspoonful of salt, one ounce of gelatin 
and three grated cucumbers. Dissolve the 
gelatin in a little of the water (cold). Put 
the rest of the water over to boil with the salt. 
Add the gelatin; take from the fire and stir 
thoroughly till dissolved. Then add the cucum- 
ber. 

A tiny drop of green coloring adds to the 
appearance of this jelly, and if you get the kind 
made from vegetables, it is harmless. 

Pour into small cups or individual jelly 
molds. 

Clean and wash the fish thoroughly; then 
dry, pepper and salt and brush with vegetable 
oil. Put near to flame to brown first one side, 
then turn and brown the other side. 

Remove the cold jelly from molds and serve 
with the hot broiled fish and tartar sauce. 
(Tartar sauce is made by adding chopped dill 
pickles and capers to mayonnaise dressing, as 
given under salads.)

LOBSTER THERMIDOR 

Drop the lobsters in boiling water and cook 
until shells are thoroughly red. Remove and 
cool. When cold, cut the shell carefully down 
the soft part, to keep the shell intact ; take off 
the claws and remove meat. 

CREAM SAUCE 

1 pint half milk, half cream 

1 teaspoon butter 

1 teaspoon salt 

1 tablespoon corn flour (not cornstarch) 

^4 CU P of sherry 

Melt the butter in a saucepan; add the flour, 
and stir till smooth. Add milk and cream a 
little at a time until it is all added; then cook 
slowly for about five minutes. Add the salt. 

MAYONNAISE FOR LOBSTER THERMIDOR 

1 pint salad oil

almost drop by drop to begin with — the salad 
oil, adding every two or three minutes some of 
the vinegar until all the oil and vinegar are 
used. Add mustard. 

The above amount of sauce will do for about 
a dozen one-pound lobsters. 

Cut the lobster meat in one-inch squares and 
mix with the cream sauce. Then add the may- 
onnaise. Put back into shells; sprinkle with 
grated cheese and bread crumbs ; and put under

PIGEON PIE 

Pigeons are not much used for food, except 
as squab, but the older pigeon is delicious when 
properly cooked; and in England, pigeon pie is 
a famous dish. 

For pigeon pie, older pigeons, if cooked as 
follows, are very delicious; and not so expen- 
sive as young pigeons or squab. 

Cover the bottom of a stewpan with one-half 
cup of crisco. Add a small onion cut into bits, 
a carrot diced, and a teaspoonful of salt. Put 
in pigeons, each cut into four pieces; cover with 
boiling water. Cover tightly and let simmer 
slowly until the pigeon is tender ; adding boil- 
ing water when necessary. 

Thicken the gravy with corn flour, and put 
all into a baking dish, with a cup turned up- 
side down in the center to hold the gravy. 
Cover the top with well-seasoned, fluffy 
mashed potato (by squeezing the potato 
through a pastry tube a very pretty top is 
made) . Put into the oven to brown, and serve.

SQUAB ON HOMINY SQUARES 

The United States Food Commission says: 
"Eat delicacies." So those who love squab may 
indulge with a clear conscience, provided they 
substitute fried hominy squares for the usual 
wheat-bread toast. 



HOMINY SQUARES 

Cook one quarter of a pound of hominy in a 
quart of boiling water and one teaspoonful of 
salt. Stir continuously and cook for half an 
hour. 

Pour into a bread tin, and when thoroughly 
cold cut into triangles about one-half inch 
thick. 

Dip into egg and bread crumbs, and fry in

Use a broiling or young roasting chicken. 

Cut the chicken into portions, salt and 
dredge with corn flour. 

Put into a pan with very little water. Cover 
tightly and roast till tender; then remove cover 
and let brown. 

Cut a gash in each chestnut and put in hot 
oven for a few minutes till the shells are easy 
to remove ; take off also the brown inside skin. 
Boil in salted water till very tender ; strain and 
allow to dry a bit on top of oven; then serve 
with the chicken. 

Chestnuts are full of nutriment, and chicken 
is one of the things we should use often in place 
of meat.

Soak over night one pair of rabbits, after 
they are cleaned and cut into quarters, in two 
quarts of water, one-half cup of vinegar, a 
few bay leaves, two onions — sliced — and a few 
allspice. 

Throw this all off in the morning and wash 
the rabbits in fresh water. Cover with cold 
water; put on the fire and when it comes to the 
boiling-point throw this water off. 

Then put on two quarts of boiling water, 
with salt to season, and cook till tender, or 
about one hour. 

Thicken the gravy with three tablespoonfuls 
of corn flour; add a wineglassful of sherry; and 
serve with potato balls made of mashed potato 
brushed with beaten egg and browned in the

the appearance. 

Rabbit is really delicious meat, and has been 
very little used. It can be used in any form in 
which one would use chicken.

BROILED CALVES BRAINS WITH 
PEAS 

Many have a prejudice against calves brains, 
because they have not been in the habit of eat- 
ing them ; but they are such a delicacy that we 
should overcome this idea and use them more 
often. After all, it is a ridiculous thing to 
eat and enjoy calves liver and shrink from eat- 
ing calves brains. And calves brains, too, have 
the merit of being inexpensive — a rare merit in 
these days of soaring prices. In our own home, 
they have been served and enjoyed by people 
who might have turned up their noses had they 
known what they were eating (a small decep- 
tion, which is quite permissible in proving the 
point that they are a real delicacy). 

This recipe, calling for one pair of calves 
brains, is a generous portion for two. 

1 pair brains 

2 cups peas (or can of peas) 
1 teaspoon salt 

Few grains of pepper 
1 tablespoon butter 
1 tablespoon vinegar 
1 bay leaf 



62 MEATLESS RECIPES 

Boil the brains in one quart of water, with 
one teaspoonful of salt, one bay leaf and a 
tablespoonful of vinegar, for one hour. Re- 
move the skim. 

Make a sauce by browning four tablespoon- 
fuls of butter and adding four tablespoonfuls 
of vinegar. 

Moisten the cooked brains with a little of this 
sauce; sprinkle a few crumbs on top; and broil 
until a light brown. 

Serve on rye bread toast, and garnish with 
the peas. 

Pour the remaining hot butter sauce over 
the brains just before serving.

It is best to make this salad two or three 
hours before serving, so that the potatoes ab- 
sorb the dressing. Keep in the ice-box.

Boil all together for one-half hour. Strain

skimmed milk cheese and stir until smooth. 

Poach six eggs and place on six slices of

Pour the sauce onto the platter around the

This is a war time recipe because it is a meat

the cheese is skimmed milk cheese. It gives 
the flavor but saves full cream milk for the

SALADS IN WAR TIME 



We serve the Railroad, Fuel and Food Adminis- 
trators all three at one time by using salads. Isn't 
such a service worthy of cultivation? For salads 
are made from things that grow nearby and do not 
have to be carried a long haul before they reach 
your table; and every inch of space in freight cars 
that you release for coal or war essentials serves a 
big purpose. Salads are nourishing, for they are 
made with olive oil, a vegetable fat; and when you 
eat vegetable fat, you require less meat fat like ba- 
con or beef which we must release for use overseas. 
Why not serve these three important officers of our 
Government and use salads often!

FOR FRUIT SALADS 

Mayonnaise as above is too firm to be nice 
for certain salads, such as fruits; or dry vege- 
tables, such as potato. The above mayonnaise 
should be thinned with just a little cream — 
sweet or whipped cream or even a little sour 
cream — but care must be taken not to add too 
much. A teaspoonful will thin it down very 
much.

Russian dressing makes a very appetizing

mix four tablespoonfuls of chili sauce and a 
tiny dash of Worcestershire sauce just before 
serving.

LETTUCE 

As in nearly every salad lettuce or some 
green leaf is used, it is wise to begin by de- 
scribing how lettuce should be cared for. When 
served it should be clean, crisp and dry. There- 
fore, it should be carefully picked apart and 
washed as soon as it comes into the house ; then 
shaken gently in a cloth to dry it, and wrapped 
lightly in cheese-cloth and put in the ice-box. 
It then will be crisp and clean and dry when- 
ever wanted.

POTATO SALAD 

Potato salad is very good with sardines or 
any cold fish, chicken or meats. 

Slice cold boiled potatoes and fresh cucum- 
bers. Mix with a little vinegar and onion 
juice; then mix all with mayonnaise dressing — 
recipe for which is given in this chapter — 
thinned with a little sweet or sour cream. 

It is best to make this salad and keep it on 
ice two or three hours before serving, so that 
the potatoes absorb the dressing and the salad 
is thoroughly chilled.

three curled anchovies around the edge of each

a little of the center and%rate a tiny dash of 
onion into each tomato. Place three or four 
cooked cold asparagus tips in each and a little 
French dressing. Then place a spoonful of 
mayonnaise on top, shake a dash of paprika 
over all. and serve with lettuce leaves. 



86 SALADS IN WAR TIME 

STUFFED PEACH SALAD 

For this salad, use cottage cheese, which can 
be made at home as described in Chapter VII, 
or purchased ready-made. Do not use cream 
cheese, as just now the butter fats in cream 
cheese should be conserved for the use of chil- 
dren and invalids. 

Peel and cut large fresh peaches (if out of 
season, use canned peaches) in half, removing 
the stone. Mix a few chopped salted pecans 
or any salted nuts into the cottage cheese, and 
fill each pit hole with this mixture. 

Place the stuffed peaches on lettuce leaves. 
Pour French dressing carefully over each one ; 
then put a small spoonful of mayonnaise on 
top — not covering the cheese entirely; a dash 
of paprika, and they are ready to serve. 

Buttered Graham or other brown crackers 
warmed in the oven till crisp are a very nice 
war time cracker to serve with this salad. 

Pears or pineapple may be used in place of 
peaches to vary this salad. Made from any 
of them, it is delicious and very pretty to 
look at. 



SALADS IN WAR TIME 87 



CANTELOUPE SALAD 

Cut a chilled canteloupe in half and remove 
the seeds. Then, using a small round potato 
scoop, scoop out little balls of melon. Mix 
with French dressing and serve thoroughly 
chilled on lettuce leaves. 



88 SALADS IN WAR TIME 

BEET AND SHREDDED CABBAGE 
MAYONNAISE 

Cook new beets until tender. Skin and 
when cold cut in even small cubes and mix with 
French dressing. Put on ice and chill thor- 
oughly. 

Shred crisp new cabbage very fine and mix 
with mayonnaise dressing; form in a nest and 
shape around the edge of a platter. Then 
pour the beet cubes in the center. 

Decorate the mound of beets with a spoonful 
of mayonnaise and serve very cold. 

Raw cabbage is much more easily digested 
than when cooked. 



SALADS IN WAR TIME 89 



ROMAINE AND STUFFED CELERY 

Wash and dry stalks of celery (the largest 
ones are good for this salad). Fill each stalk 
with a mixture of roquef ort and cottage cheese 
— about one-third roquefort and two-thirds 
cottage cheese, well mashed and mixed to- 
gether. If too thick a paste, thin with a little 
olive oil. 

Then cut the stuffed stalks in half-inch 
pieces and serve on romaine leaves with French 
dressing. 



90 SALADS IN WAR TIME 



MIXED VEGETABLE SALAD 

For this salad any vegetables can be used 
and it is an excellent way to use up bits of cold 
boiled vegetables — left-overs that are too small 
to make a dish in themselves. Cold string 
beans, brussels sprouts, peas, lima beans, beets, 
potatoes and uncooked cabbage — any or all of 
these. 

Mix them together (the larger vegetables 
such as potatoes and beets should be cubed and 
the cabbage should be shredded) with a little 
French dressing to moisten it well. Place in 
a deep bowl which h.as been rubbed with a gar- 
lic clove, or onion; cover the top with mayon- 
naise; and decorate with lettuce or watercress 
and a few peas or sweet red or green peppers. 



SALADS IN WAR TIME 91 



GREEN VEGETABLE SALAD 

For this salad any or all of the following 
vegetables may be used : cucumbers ; tomatoes, 
sliced ; sweet or new spring onions ; green pep- 
pers ; radishes. 

Choose a large lettuce leaf and place it in 
the center of the platter ; fill full with mayon- 
naise dressing. Group the other vegetables — 
each one separate from the other — around the 
dressing. Slice the cucumbers; quarter the 
tomatoes; leave a little green on the radishes 
and onions. Pour a little French dressing 
over them all. 

When salad is arranged in this way, those 
who choose to do so can omit the onions.

WHEATLESS CAKES, BREADS AND 
PIES 



Because most wheat substitutes cost more, it does 
not necessarily follow that the household budget will 
be increased. Some flours, notably potato, go much 
farther than wheat, so it really is less expensive in 
the end. I maintain that when we buy the "substi- 
tute" we do only half our duty, the other half being 
to use all we buy and waste not a scrap ; make things 
so good that every bit will be eaten. In our reck- 
less, American way, we have allowed food to be 
wasted because it was cheap or because we thought 
it niggardly to be too careful. Now all that is 
changed. We must not waste, and that means we 
must buy only what we can use entirely before it 
becomes too old to eat. If we do what I call the 
"other half" of food conservation, that is waste 
nothing, our food budget will not increase so alarm- 
ingly-

to melt. Place the bowl in a dish of hot water, 
not on the stove. Stir gently until all is melted. 
If the sweet chocolate is allowed to get too 
hot, the icing will be streaky and not shiny and 
dark.

Cook the maple sugar and the water, or the 
syrup, till the thermometer registers 230 de- 
grees. The thermometer should be placed in 
the kettle when the syrup is first placed on 
stove. (Lacking a thermometer, the syrup 
may be tested by dropping a little of it into a 
cup of cold water. When thick enough to be 
picked up in a soft ball, it is done.) 

Remove from the fire; take out the ther- 
mometer; let the syrup stand about two min- 
utes; then pour a little at a time on the well- 
beaten egg whites, beating hard. A Dover 
egg-beater is best.

Shave and place in a bowl to melt. Place 
the bowl in a dish of hot water, not on the stove. 
Stir gently from time to time until all is 
melted. If the sweet chocolate is allowed to

Pour into greased round Boston bread tin 
molds. Steam three hours in closely covered 
kettle. Let the water come half way up the 
molds. Renew the water from time to time as 
needed. 

Most households have many bread pieces and 
crusts that are thrown out. Save them, and 
make this delicious brown bread.

Sift the flours and baking powder and salt 
together; add the molasses and nut meats. 

Bake in deep bread tins, in a very slow oven, 
from two and a half to three hours. 

The above Quantity makes two loaves. 



WHEATLESS CAKE, BREAD, PIE 113 



WAR BREAD 

4 cups oatmeal flour 

4 cups rye flour 

4 cups rice flour 

8 cups mashed potato 

7 pints water (lukewarm) 

£ Magic yeast cakes 

2 cups molasses 

1 tablespoon salt 

1 tablespoon shortening 

Mix and sift all of the flours, and add the 
mashed potato — to which the salt and shorten- 
ing have been added. 

Soak the yeast in one-half cup of lukewarm 
water till soft. 

Add the molasses, lukewarm water and yeast 
to the flour. Work up into a good stiff batter. 

Raise for six hours. 

Mix on the bread board, using some of the 
flour from above. Mix for about fifteen 
minutes. 

Raise in pans for about two hours, or until it 
doubles its bulk. 



114 WHEATLESS CAKE, BREAD, PIE 

Bake in a moderate oven for one hour and 
fifteen minutes. 

This bread should be made fresh every day 
or two. Potato breads are apt to sour, and 
never keep as do wheat breads. 



WHEATLESS CAKE, BREAD, PIE 115 



RAISED CORN AND RYE ROLLS

Raise about six hours in a warm place. 

Roll into little balls or Parker house roll 
shapes. Put into a pan and let raise one hour. 

Brush with milk, and bake in a moderate 
oven about twenty minutes. 

Corn flour is new to many people and at 
present not easy to get, but it is one of the 
flours we are urged to use, and, I am told by 
the United States Food Administration, will 
soon be on sale everywhere, owing to the de- 
mand.

STATE OF MAINE BUCKWHEAT 
CAKES 

1 quart thick sour milk 

1 small teaspoon soda 

1 teaspoon salt 

Buckwheat flour to make a thin batter 

Bake on a hot greased griddle. 

Both buckwheat and sour milk should be 
used — to save wheat flour for our soldiers and 
sweet milk for our babies. 

Maple syrup, too, is a sweetener that we 
may use with a clear conscience. 

These cakes may be served at breakfast or 
as a luncheon dessert. 



120 WHEATLESSCAKE, BREAD, PIE 



WHEATLESS PASTRY 

Wheatless pastry is not like the pie we made from 
white wheat flour, but it is tender and has a nutty 
flavor that is pleasant. It is rather difficult to 
handle, as it breaks apart easily when rolled thin. 
I therefore recommend the substitution of tarts, in* 
dividual pies, or pies without top crust, when mak- 
ing wheatless pastry. 



WHEATLESS PUMPKIN PIE 

For one large pie, use: 

2 cups pumpkin 

2 eggs 

1 cup milk 

^4 teaspoon cinnamon 

% teaspoon ginger 

1/2 teaspoon salt 

% cup light strained honey 

(Use fresh pumpkins as long as they are 
in the market, for they are perishable. Cut

up, peel and steam for fifteen minutes or until 
tender.) 

PASTRY 

% cup barley flour 
^4 cup corn flour 
% teaspoon salt 
% cup hard vegetable shortening 
2 tablespoons ice-cold water 

Sift the two flours and salt together. Cut 
into it the shortening, using a knife, until it 
is in tiny bits. Then rub together lightly with 
the hands until all ingredients are well blended; 
then add the water, mixing as little as possible. 

Mold into a ball. Place on a floured bread- 
board and roll as thinly as possible. Fold 
over rolling-pin and lift into pie tin, pressing 
edges firmly into place, trimming the uneven 
edges. Fill with above pumpkin mixture and 
bake in a moderate oven about fifteen minutes. 



122 WHEATLESS CAKE, BREAD, PIE 

WHEATLESS FRUIT TARTS 

PASTRY SHELLS 

1% cups barley flour 
% cup corn flour (not cornstarch) 

1 teaspoon salt 
% cup hard vegetable shortening 
4 tablespoons ice-cold water 

Sift the two flours and salt together ; cut into 
it the shortening, using a knife, until it is in 
tiny bits. Then rub together lightly with the 
hands until all the ingredients are well blended. 
Now add the water, mixing as little as possible. 

Mold into a ball. Place on a well-floured 
bread-board. Roll thin, using a little flour on 
the rolling-pin. 

Cut with a large biscuit-cutter and place 
over bottoms of muffin tins. 

Bake in a hot oven until light brown. 

When cold, fill the shells with fruit filling. 

FRUIT FILLING FOR TARTS 

Use rhubarb, strawberries, cherries, rasp- 
berries or currants. 



WHEATLESSCAKE, BREAD, PIE US 

Canned fruit may be used in winter, but as 
they are sweetened, reduce the sugar quantity 
one-half. 

1 quart fruit (any of the above varieties) 
1 cup maple sugar (crushed) 
% cup water 
3 level tablespoons cornstarch 

Boil until the fruit is tender. Then add 
three level tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, dis- 
solved in a tablespoonful of water. Boil 
slowly, stirring constantly, for about five min- 
utes longer. 

When cold, fill the tart molds and serve. 



124 WHEATLESSCAKE,BEEAD,PIE 

WHEATLESS APPLE PIE 

S cups barley flour 
\y% teaspoons salt

4 to 6 tablespoons beaten egg 

Cut the shortening into the mixed flour and 
salt with a knife, then rub together lightly by 
hand until all is well mixed. Add the egg. 
Try four tablespoonfuls first; if not moist 
enough to handle, add more. 

Roll out on flour-dusted bread-board. Fold 
over rolling-pin and lift into pie tin. The 
broken spots can be mended with a little of the 
pastry, as one would putty up a crack. 

Peel, core and slice three quarts of green- 
ing apples. If apples are green or new, use 
two cups of shaved or grated maple sugar; if 
old apples, use one and one-half cups. 

Sprinkle bottom of the pie crust with two 
tablespoonfuls of the maple sugar and about 
a tablespobnful of flour. Put in about half of 
the apples; sprinkle with sugar and add the 
balance of the apples and all the rest of the

TEA BISCUIT 

The tea biscuit in this recipe requires a little 
wheat flour, but the amount is so small (one- 
third) that the recipe will be useful when a 
small amount of wheat is available. These bis- 
cuit are quite as nice as any baking-powder 
biscuit made entirely from wheat and are for 
this reason particularly desirable for straw- 
berry shortcakes, chicken fricassee, and to serve 
as a bread substitute. 

1 cup freshly mashed or riced potato 
1 cup rice flour 

1 cup wheat flour 

2 teaspoons baking powder 
1 teaspoon salt 

1 tablespoon vegetable shortening 
1 cup milk 

Sift the flours, baking powder and salt well 
together. Cut in the shortening into small bits. 
When all is well mixed in, add the milk. 

Mix until smooth and turn out on a floured 
bread-board. Roll to the thickness of an inch. 
Cut with a biscuit-cutter and place in a but- 
tered tin. 

Bake in a hot oven for about twenty minutes.

the syrup is dropped into cold water. 

Any of the sauce which is not used can be 
kept and reheated (with the addition of a 
tablespoonful of water) at any time. 



134 WAE TIME DESSERTS 

FRUIT ICES— SUGARLESS 

The U. S. Food Administration has asked 
all ice-cream manufacturers to discontinue 
making water-ices, because they require so 
much sugar. However, water-ices made with 
honey are entirely permissible and are "good 
food conservation," as they use fresh fruit, and 
no sugar. 

For making fruit ice, one should have a 
small cooking thermometer (these cost about 
$1.25 to $1.50 each), as it is impossible to test 
the syrup accurately without one; and upon 
the correct density of the syrup depends the 
smoothness of the ice. The syrup should be 
well boiled up, but not firm enough to be found 
in cold water when tested in that way. 



WAR TIME DESSERTS 135 

LOGANBERRY ICE 

1 pint loganberry juice 
Juice one lemon 
1 pound strained honey 
1% quarts water 
% teaspoon cream of tartar 

Put honey, water and cream of tartar over 
the fire and cook to 220 degrees by cooking 
thermometer; lacking a thermometer, let the 
syrup cook five minutes after reaching the boil- 
ing-point. 

When cold, add loganberry and lemon juice 
and freeze. (Use two-thirds ice and one-third 
coarse salt; water-ices require more salt in 
freezing than ice-creams.) 

Serve on a slice of orange, and decorate with 
a sprig of green. 

This recipe makes about two quarts of water- 
ice. 



136 WAR TIME DESSERTS 



STRAWBERRY ICE 

1 pint strawberry juice or mashed straw- 
berries 
Juice one lemon 
1 pound strained honey 
1% quarts water 
% teaspoon cream of tartar 

Put honey, water, and cream of tartar over 
the fire and cook to 220 degrees by the cook- 
ing thermometer; lacking a thermometer, let 
the syrup cook five minutes after reaching the 
boiling-point. 

When cold, add strawberry juice and lemon 
juice and freeze. (Use two-thirds ice and one- 
third coarse salt; water-ices require more salt 
in freezing than ice-cream.) 

Serve on a slice of orange and garnish with 
a strawberry. 

This recipe makes about two quarts of water- 
ice. 



WAR TIME DESSERTS 187 



GRAPE ICE 

An ice without sugar or cream — and it is 
delectable! 

8 pounds Concord grapes or 1 pint grape 

juice 
Juice one lemon 
1 pound strained honey 
\y% quarts water 
1/2 teaspoon cream of tartar 

Put honey, water and cream of tartar over 
the fire and cook to 220 degrees by the cook- 
ing thermometer; lacking a thermometer, let 
the syrup cook five minutes after reaching the 
boiling-point. When cold, add the grape juice 
and lemon juice and freeze. (Use two-thirds 
ice and one-third coarse salt; water-ices require 
more salt in freezing than ice-cream. ) 

Serve on a slice of orange and decorate with 
two grapes and a sprig of green. 

This recipe makes about two quarts of 
water-ice. 



138 WAR TIME DESSERTS 



PINEAPPLE AMBROSIA 

Shred a fresh pineapple — not too finely — 
with a fork and mix into it one-half pound of 
marshmallows cut into pieces (shears are best 
for cutting marshmallows) . Let this stand on 
ice for a few hours. 

Just before serving, mix into it two cups of 
whipped cream sweetened to taste (use 
strained honey) and the juice of half a lemon. 
Serve immediately in individual glasses or a 
large dessert dish, as preferred. 



WAR TIME DESSERTS 139 



MOUNT BLANC 

(A dessert made from chestnuts — big Ital- 
ian chestnuts — or marrons, as they are called 
in France. I loved this dessert in France, and 
so I brought it home with me. And now, 
when we should eat less pastry and cake and 
ice-cream, it serves a double purpose.) 

Put a pound of large Italian chestnuts into 
the oven for a moment until the shell and inner 
skin can be easily removed. 

Boil the chestnuts in water, with three table- 
spoonfuls of honey and a generous pinch of 
salt, until they are very tender. 

Add one-half cup of honey; let it come to a 
boil; remove from the fire and let stand until 
thoroughly cold. 

Remove from the syrup (save a few large 
pieces for decoration) and run through a 
potato ricer onto a platter; mounding it high. 

Top it all with sweetened whipped cream 
(use strained honey to taste) and put a little 
cream around the edge of the dish — dotting it 
with the whole cooked chestnuts here and there. 



140 WAR TIME DESSERTS 



BROWN BETTY 

This is an excellent war time dessert — using 
left-over bread, and no sugar or flour. 

7 cups apples (chopped) 

9, cups bread crumbs (dried) 
1% cups honey 
2 cups water 
1 apple — washed, cored and sliced in rings 

Scatter the bread crumbs through the 
chopped apples, and place in a deep baking 
dish. 

Bring the honey and water to a boil, and 
pour over the apple and bread mixture. 

Sprinkle a few bread crumbs on top, with 
rings of the apple around the edge. 

Bake in a moderate oven for two hours. 

Serve with one of the following sauces. 
Either of the sauces given may be used, ac- 
cording to taste; the hard sauce, of course, is 
the richer.

RICE MOLD— MAPLE SYRUP 

1 cup rice 

2 quarts boiling water 

1 heaping tablespoon salt 

Put the rice in the boiling water and salt 
and boil hard for twenty minutes. Drain in a 
colander and pour cold water through the rice 
until th*e water runs clear.

MAPLE SPONGE 

2 cups maple sugar 

1 cup chopped nut meats 

2 egg whites 

1 envelope Knox's gelatin

and turn into a mold. 

Serve with whipped cream or with the soft 
custard given on the following page. 



146 WAR TIME DESSERTS 



SOFT CUSTARD 

(This is an inexpensive substitute for cream 
to serve with stewed fruits. We are urged 
to use stewed or fresh fruits particularly for 
desserts.) 

1 pint milk 

2 level tablespoons cornstarch 

1 tablespoon strained honey or maple sugar 
*4 teaspoon salt 
Beaten yolk of 1 egg 

Put the milk and sugar or honey in a double- 
boiler. When boiling, add the cornstarch dis- 
solved in a little of the cold milk, and stir con- 
stantly for about fifteen minutes, being certain 
it boils all the time. 

Remove from the fire and add the beaten 
yolk of egg. 



WAR TIME DESSERTS 147 



BANUTTI 

6 bananas 

Juice of Y2 lemon 
% pound nut meats

Serve very cold in glasses, with a few can- 
died cherries on top. 

This amount will serve about eight persons. 



148 WAR TIME DESSERTS 



BAKED PEACHES 

12 peaches (whole and fresh) 

1 cup honey 

2 cups water 

Wash the peaches and place in a baking 
pan. Pour over them the water and sugar. 
Cover the pan and bake one hour, or until soft. 

Serve ice-cold, with whipped cream and two 
tablespoonfuls of rum poured on peaches just 
before serving. 



WAR TIME DESSERTS 149

Then add to this the melted butter and mix 
into the dry ingredients — stirring until all is 
a smooth paste. 

Now add the balance of the milk until it 
makes a thin batter. 

Bake on a hot greased griddle, making each 
cake six to eight inches across. 

Butter and sprinkle with shaved maple 
sugar. Place one on top of the other until a

BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC. 

FROSTED SARSAPARILLA 

Into one-fourth glass of sweet cream, pour 
ice-cold sarsaparilla — slowly, so that it will not 
foam and run over. 

A spoonful of whipped cream on top finishes 
this delectable and nourishing drink. 



154 BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC 



LOGANBERRY MINT JULEP 

Soak a bunch of fresh crushed mint in bot- 
tled loganberry juice for two hours ; then add 
as much sparkling water as juice. 

Strain, pour into glass, and serve with a 
marshmallow, a loganberry or raspberry, and 
quite a good bunch of fresh mint. 

If this is not sweet enough, strained honey 
to taste may be added. 




LOGANBERRY MINT JULEP 




RHUBARB CONSERVE WITH HOME-MADE COTTAGE CHEESE 



BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC. 155 



SPICED LEMONADE 

% teaspoon whole allspice 
% teaspoon cloves 
A small piece of stick cinnamon 

Put the spices into one quart of cold water 
and bring to a good boil. When cold, make 
lemonade from this spice water, using the juice 
of four lemons to the quart of water. 

Sweeten to taste (strained honey can be 
used in place of cane sugar), and serve with 
a slice of lemon, having a clove stuck in its 
center, a stick of whole cinnamon decorated 
with fresh mint, and a plentiful supply of 
cracked ice. 



156 BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC. 



CREAMED GINGER ALE 

Use extra dry ginger ale, if possible, and 
fill the glass one-fourth with sweet cream. 

Pour the ginger ale into the cream very 
gently — as it foams very high unless one is 
careful. 

Serve at once. 



BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC. 157 



SPARKLE PUNCH 

Put a large piece of solid ice in the punch 
bowl. 

To each bottle of ice-cold ginger ale — extra 
dry is best — use the juice of one orange and 
one lemon; pour over the ice as soon as the 
ginger ale is opened. If the ale is ice-cold 
before making punch, it will retain its sparkle 
until all is served. 

This is a very delicious punch for dances, as 
it is sparkling and not too sweet. 



» 



158 BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC. 



FRESH LIME-ADE 

Use the juice of two fresh limes to the juice 
of each lemon ; sweeten with strained honey to 
taste. 

To each lemon, add a large glass and a half 
of water; and allow two tablespoonfuls of 
shaved ice to each glass. 

Float a slice of lime with a clove and a 
currant or red berry in each glass. 



BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC. 159 

COTTAGE CHEESE 

Cottage cheese we are urged by the Gen 
ernment to use in place of cream cheese. It] 
is easily made at home from milk or cream 
that has become sour and might otherwise not 
be used. To use everything tsoe buy for food 
is an important part of food conservation — 
and it is the only way in which we can econo- 
mize in these days of high prices. 

There are many Ways in which cottage 
cheese is deliriously served. I have here illus- 
trated it served with a sweet as dessert. This 
cheese needs cream or other fats to make it 
richly delicious; but as cream is one of the 
things we are asked to conserve, I find it splen- 
did when moistened with salad oil — seasoned 
with salt and a dash of paprika. You may 
wish to serve it with a salad ; in which case, add 
chopped parsley, chives or olives, and roll into 
small balls. 

Pour three quarts of boiling water on three 
quarts of sour lobbered milk. Let it stand a 
few minutes, then pour into cheese-cloth and 
drain over night. Another way is to heat the 



160 BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC. 

sour lobbered milk to blood heat or lukewarm, 
and keep it at this temperature (no warmer) 
until the curd forms and comes to the top ; then 
strain into a cloth to drain. The first way is 
safer, for if you heat the milk a bit too warm, 
the curd will be hard and not soft and creamy. 



BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC. 161 



RHUBARB CONSERVE 

Boil for twenty minutes, four pounds of 
rhubarb cut into small pieces, leaving the skin 
on. 

Add the juice of five lemons and the rind, 
which has been sliced off thinly and boiled in 
a little water for about twenty minutes, or 
until soft, then chopped fine. 

To this add six pounds of light maple sugar, 
one pound of blanched almonds, chopped or 
cut, and one wine-glass of Jamaica ginger. 

Boil all together until thick. 

The almonds may be omitted, if desired, and 
still leave a delicious marmalade. 



162 BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC. 



CUCUMBER PICKLES 

We ought to make our own pickles and use 
them in place of olives, which have to be trans- 
ported so great a distance, thus helping to 
congest our railroads in war time. Use things 
near at hand for food, so railroads can be used 
for necessities such as coal and munitions. 

1 gallon vinegar 

1 cup salt 

1 cup mustard 

Stand the vinegar on the stove until it comes 
to a boil ; when perfectly cold add the salt and 
mustard. Should the vinegar be very strong, 
reduce one-half with cold water before adding 
the salt and mustard. 

Select cucumbers two to three inches long. 
Scrub them thoroughly with a vegetable 
brush; wipe with a cloth and pack in jars. 
Fill with vinegar mixture and seal. 

A little fresh horseradish added to each jar 
improves the flavor. 

These pickles will keep hard and crisp for 
two years, are easy to make and very delicious. 



BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC. 168 



HOME-MADE RELISH 

% cabbage 
6 green peppers 
S cucumbers 
5 beets 
9, small onions 

1 cup vinegar 

2 tablespoons maple sugar 
2 tablespoons salt 

1 teaspoon paprika 

Chop all the vegetables together; add the 
vinegar, maple sugar, salt and paprika. 

Mix well together, and serve on a lettuce 
leaf. 



164 BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC. 



GINGER PEAR 

Use hard pears; peel; core and cut into 
small pieces. 

8 pounds pears — after they are cut 
8 pounds sugar 
Juice of 4 lemons 
1 pint water 
% pound ginger sliced thin 

Cut the lemon rinds into long thin strips. 
Put all into a kettle and simmer until the pears 
are tender. Seal in glass jars. 

If one wants it very thick, simmer it a much 
longer time.

PREFACE 

In tiie early days of the war, I came away 
from a talk with Mr. Hoover and Dr. Taylor 
of the Department of Agriculture, convinced 
that iudess I could make candy without sugar 
and cake, and bread without wheat, I was daily 
depriving our suffering Allies and our Soldiers 
of food they sorely needed — Soldiers do not 
fight well if ^nderfed, nor have they good 
morale if their families at home are hungry. 
So it seemed to me that women's first war ac- 
tivity should be to cooperate fully with the 
Food Administration ; and I then and there de- 
termined that I would sell and serve in my 
shops only foods that entirely conformed to 
the requirements of the United States Food 
Administration. It has meant a good deal of 
very interesting work, but the results have far 
exceeded my hopes, and all these recipes are 
now in daily use in my shops. 

My opportunities for testing recipes are 
many times greater than those of most women, 
and war time foods that my patrons will order 



▼i PREFACE 



and enjoy must possess qualities of merit. 
The requests for my war time recipes have 
been so abundant that I am gathering these 
recipes together in book form, that they may 
help some folks who have the same earnest 
desire as myself to aid the Food Administra- 
tion in every way but lack the facilities and 
time to work out theu- own recipes. 

The Food Administration's rulings will 
change from time to time, along with crop and 
other conditions ; but the need for wheat, meat, 
and sugar conservation — except perhaps for 
short periods — ^will continue as long as the 
wheat and beet sugar fields of Europe remain 
battle fields and men, who might be raising 
crops and animals for food, are soldiers. 

Fish and poultry, fresh vegetables and 
fruits that grow nearby (foods that must be 
carried a long distance by our already over- 
burdened railroads must be used as little as 
possible) should form tiie greater part of our 
diet, and can do so with no sense of depriva- 
tion if a little added care and attention be given 
to menu-making and cookery. 

Maby Elizabeth. 
May, 1918.

SUGARLESS CANDIES 



All these eandiei are made without cane sugar; 
honey^ maple sugar and fruits being the only sweet- 
enen One may eat all this sort of candy one wishes 
without depriving our Soldiers or Allies of sugars 

Most of these candy recipes require a thermom- 
eter test. (A confectioners' thermometer can be 
had at any optical shop — costing about $1.50.) 



CHAPTER I 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 



MAPLE SUGAR CARAMELS 

1 lb. (two cupfiils) maple sugar 
1% lbs. (one and one-half cupfuls) com syrup 
1 qt^ (four cupfuls) sweet cream 
1 can best brand condensed milk 

Stir continuously while cooking, and cook 
to 240 degrees by the thermometer in winter; 
242 degrees by the thermometer in summer. 

Pour into an oiled oblong cake-tin to cool. 

Turn pan upside down on a cutting board 
and let the caramel fall out. Then cut first 
into strips, then into squares with a large sharp 
knife. 

If the caramels are not to be used at once, 
wrap them in oiled paper. 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 



FIG WALNUTS 

Wash a few layer figs, removing the stem 
of each one, and place them in a sieve, over a 
kettle of boiling water. Cover tightly axid let 
them steam for five minutes. 

Crack walnuts, so as to remove the meats 
whole, by striking the nut on the smooth side. 

When the figs are cool enough to handle, 
put through a meat grinder or chop very fi/ne 
in a chopping bowL Form the chopped figs 
into small balls (a little sherry may be mixed 
in if desired) and place a walnut meat on each 
side. 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 



MAPLE BONBONS 

Boil a quart of the finest maple syrup, re- 
moving from the fire when the thermometer 
registers 284 degrees. Stir continuously until 
it becomes quite firm and creamy. 

Drop from a spoon on waxed paper, and 
press a pecan meat on the top of each ball. 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 



HONEY COCOANUT FRUIT 

SQUARES 

Cover one-half pound of desiccated cocoa- 
nut with fresh milk and let it stand for a few 
moments. 

Cook one pound of strained honey until it 
comes to a good boil; add the cocoanut and 
cook all until it will drop from a spoon in a 
thick string. 

Stir in one-fourth cup of washed currants 
and pour into an oiled tin. 

When cold, cut into inch squares.

PECAN PATTIES 

Cook one quart of maple syrup until the 
thermometer registers 249 degrees. Add one- 
fourth pound of butter. 

Remove from fire and stir in one and one- 
half cups of pecan meats. 

Spoon out into oiled patty tins or muffin 
rings, and wrap each patty in oiled paper when 
cold.

STUFFED CARAMELS 

For the caramel, use the Maple Sugar Cara- 
mel recipe and leave the caramel uncut. 



MAPLE FONDANT 

Cook one quart of maple syrup until the 
thermometer registers 241 degrees. Wipe 
away any grains that form on the sides of the 
saucepan while the syrup is cooking; do this 
with dampened cheese-cloth wrapped round a 
fork. 

When thermometer registers 241 degrees, 
remove at once from the fire and pour on to a 
platter, which should be as cold as possible and 
slightly dampened (do not oil). 

As soon as the first heat has passed, begin 
beating with a fork and continue so to beat and 
mix until the fondant becomes too hard to mix 
with the fork.

Then press all together by hand and cover 
with a damp cheese-cloth for about ten 
minutes. 

Turn the pan of cold maple caramel upside 
down on a kneading-board and remove the 
tin. 

Knead well some of the maple fondant and 
roll into a piece as long as the maple caramel 
and about two inches in diameter. Lay on the 
caramel and fold the caramel around it as 
illustrated. 

Pinch firmly where the two edges come 
together, and let all stand, seam edge down, 
for a few moments, to seal it together. Then 
gently stretch one end, a little at a time, into 
a long neck; cut off into small pieces with a 
sharp knife, as illustrated. 

If the caramels are not to be eaten at once, 
wrap each one in waxed paper. 

Maple fondant may be made on a large plat- 
ter — if not more than a pound and a half is 
desired. In quantities larger than this and up 
to five pounds- (more than five pounds at a

time is too difficult to beat) a marble slab or 
table-top should be used to pour the cooked 
syrup on, and to beat it into a cream. 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 11 



HONEY CORN BALLS 

Pop one and one-half pounds of the best 
popping com. Sort or sift out any unpopped 
kernels and put in the oven to keep warm. 

Cook two pounds of strained honey until the 
candy thermometer registers 240 degrees. 

Add butter the size of a walnut and cook to 
242 degrees. 

Pour a small quantity on to the popped com 
and mold what is moist into firm balls ; then add 
more syrup and mold until all is used. 

This quantity will make about twenty large 
balls.

Add one-fourth pound of butter; mix in 
lightly and pour into oiled tins. 

When cold, cut into oblong pieces and wrap 
in waxed paper. 



16 SUGARLESS CANDIES 



HONEY NOUGAT 

Nougat is made in two batches. The first 
one can be made the day before the other, or 
a double batch can be made and half of it be 
kept on hand in an air-tight Mason jar to be 
used later. 

First batch: Cook one and one-half pounds 
(two cupfuls) of com syrup to 280 degrees by 
the thermometer. Add one-quarter pound of 
XXXX sugar, and pour all slowly on to the 
well-beaten whites of two eggs. Then add, a 
little at a time, beating constantly, one-half 
ounce of powdered gum arabic and one-fourth 
ounce of pulverized gelatin, dissolved in a lit- 
tle water. 

Second batch: Blanch one pound of almonds 
and one-half pound of pistachio nuts, and put 
in warming oven to dry out thoroughly. Line 
a pan with rice-wafer paper; use a little water 
to wet the edges so they will stick together; 
have the entire pan sides as well as the bottom 
covered. 

Cook one pound (one and one-quarter cup- 
fuls) strained honey, one and one-half pounds 



SUGARLESS CANDIES 17 

(three eupfuls) shaved maple sugar, one pound 
(three-quarters cupful) corn syrup, one ounce 
cocoa butter, and one-half pint (one cupful) 
water to 268 degrees by the thermometer. 

Pour this batch slowly into batch number 
one, beating constantly. When all this syrup 
is added, put in the blanched nuts, mixing well. 

Pour the nougat into the wafer-lined pan 
and cover the top with rice-paper. Put a sheet 
of heavy wax-paper on top of all and weight 
the nougat with one or two flatirons. 

When cold, remove flatirons, turn pan up- 
side-down, and cut with a sharp caramel knife. 

Wrap each piece in wax-paper. 

The rice-paper is edible and wholesome and 
need not be removed. It can be bought at a 
confectioners' supply store. One can use the 
small rice- wafers, which are on sale for gold- 
fish food, if larger sheets are not easily f oimd, 
as it is the same thing; but the larger sheets 
are the more practical. 



18 SUGARLESS CANDIES 



COCOANUT MAPLE CREAMS 

1^ pounds (three cupfuls) maple sugar 
1 can (2 cups) fresh grated cocoanut 
% cupful water 

Drain milk from the cocoanut and add 
to milk enough water to make one-half pint 
(one cupful) of liquid. Mix with sugar. Put 
on fire and stir until sugar is dissolved — ^no 
longer. 

Cook to 288 degrees by the thermometer and 
add the drained cocoanut. 

Cook to 240 degrees. Pour on to a cold, 
damp platter, and mix with a fork. 

When done, put in a double boiler, mixing 
constantly until all is melted, and drop in 
spoonfuls on waxed paper.

PUREE OF BLACK BEAN 

One pound of dried black beans; wash and 
soak overnight. Take two quarts of water, 
two quarts of soup stock, one-half teaspoonf ul 
of soda, one bay leaf, a few celery tops, two 
carrots, two small onions, one-fourth teaspoon- 
f ul of pepper, one tablespoonf ul of salt. Cook 
about three hours, then mash through a strainer 
and sl^rve with a slice of lemon floating on each 
cup or plate of soup, or a dash of chopped 
egg yolks and whites. 

Puree of black bean is a war time recipe, be- 
cause beans contain a great deal of nutriment 
and make a meat substitute. We must save 
beef for our soldiers and Allies, and each time 
we substitute vegetable soups for meat soups, 
we are conserving meats.

DUMPLINGS 

1 cup mashed potato 
1 cup rice flour 
1 teaspoon salt 

1 heaping tablespoon baking powder 

2 tablespoons vegetable fat

Rub the salt, baking powder, flour and vege- 
table fat together. Beat the one egg and one 
cup of milk together, and add lastly to the mix- 
ture. Drop from a tablespoon into two quarts 
of salted boiling water and cook ten minutes. 
Serve immediately. 

The water in which the dumplings have been 
cooked will be found to be thick and flavory. 
It can be used in any cream soup for thick- 
ening or for cream sauce. A very nice onion 
soup can be made from this thickened water by 
adding a quart of milk, a grated onion, and salt

FINNAN HADDIE— CUCUMBERS 

AND POTATOES 

Finnan Haddie is particularly nutritive, and 
in these days when we are forbidden ham and 
bacon, such salty things as this are most ac- 
ceptable. 

Wash the fish first ; then boil for a few min- 
utes, removing any skum from the top of the 
water, before removing the fish. 

Peel the cucumbers and cut into two-inch 
pieces. Boil in salt water about ten minutes. 

Cut potatoes in balls with potato cutter, and 
boil in salt water until tender. 

Make a cream sauce of two tablespoonfuls 
of com flour, mixed with one tablespoonful of 
melted butter; stir till melted and thoroughly 
mixed, then add one pint of milk slowly, and 
cook till thick; season with salt and pepper and 
a dash of celery salt. 

Put the cream sauce on a platter; then the

FRIED OYSTERS (COOKED IN 
THE OVEN)— TARTAR SAUCE 

Roll each oyster in corn flour seasoned with 
salt and pepper; dip in beaten egg; then roll 
in bread crumbs. Brush with vegetable oil, 
and bake in a hot oven tUl light brown. 

Serve with tartar sauce, which is made by 
adding chopped olives, dill pickles, parsley and 
capers to mayonnaise. (See Chapter IV for 
mayonnaise recipe.) 

By cooking oysters or any fried foods in 
this way, one conserves a good deal of fat, and 
they are even more delicious and more digest- 
ible than the old way.

f)/ BROILED BLUEFISH— CUCUMBER 

JELLY 

Make the jelly — ^using one quart of water, 
one teaspoonfnl of salt, one ounce of gelatin 
and three grated cucumbers. Dissolve the 
gelatin in a little of the water (cold). Put 
the rest of the water over to boil with the salt. 
Add the gelatin; take from the fire and stir 
thoroughly till dissolved. Then add the cucum- 
ber. 

A tiny drop of green coloring adds to the 
appearance of this jelly, and if you get the kind 
made from vegetables, it is harmless. 

Pour into small cups or individual jelly 
molds. 

Clean and wash the fish thoroughly; then 
dry, pepper and salt and brush with vegetable 
oil. Put near to flame to brown first one side, 
then turn and brown the other side. 

Remove the cold jelly from molds and serve 
with the hot broiled fish and tartar sauce. 
(Tartar sauce is made by adding chopped dill 
pickles and capers to mayonnaise dressing, as 
given under salads. )

almost drop by drop to begin with — ^the salad 
oil, adding every two or three minutes some of 
the vinegar until all the oil and vinegar are 
used. Add mustard. 

The above amount of sauce will do for about 
a dozen one-pound lobsters. 

Cut the lobster meat in one-inch squares and 
mix witii the cream sauce. Then add the may- 
onnaise. Put back into shells; sprinkle with 
grated cheese and bread crumbs ; and put under

PIGEON PIE 

Pigeons are not much used for food, except 
as squab, but the older pigeon is delicious when 
properly cooked ; and in England, pigeon pie is 
a famous dish. 

For pigeon pie, older pigeons, if cooked as 
follows, are very delicious; and not so expen- 
sive as young pigeons or squab. 

Cover the bottom of a stewpan with one-half 
cup of crisco. Add a small onion cut into bits, 
a carrot diced, and a teaspoonful of salt. Put 
in pigeons, each cut into four pieces ; cover with 
boiling water. Cover tightly and let simmer 
slowly until the pigeon is tender; adding boil- 
ing water when necessary. 

Thicken the gravy with com flour, and put 
all into a baking dish, with a cup turned up- 
side down in the center to hold the gravy. 
Cover the top with well-seasoned, fluffy

through a pastry tube a very pretty top is 
made) . Put into the oven to brown, and serve.

FRICASSEE RABBIT— POTATO 

BALLS 

Soak over night one pair of rabbits, after 
they are cleaned and cut into quarters, in two 
quarts of water, one-half cup of vinegar, a 
few bay leaves, two onions — sliced — and a few 
allspice. 

Throw this all off in the morning and wash 
the rabbits in fresh water. Cover with cold 
water; put on the fire and when it comes to the 
boiling-point throw this water off. 

Then put on two quarts of boiling water, 
with salt to season, and cook till tender, or 
about one hour. 

Thicken the gravy with three tablespoonfuls 
of corn flour ; add a wineglassf ul of sherry ; and 
serve with potato balls made of mashed potato 
brushed with beaten egg and browned in the 
oven. A clove stuck on the potato baU adds to 
the appearance. 

Rabbit is reaUy delicious meat, and has been 
very little used. It can be used in any form in 
which one would use chicken.

BROILED CALVES BRAINS WITH 

PEAS 

Many have a prejudice against calves brains, 
because they have not been in the habit of eat- 
ing them ; but they are such a delicacy that we 
should overcome this idea and use them more 
often. After all, it is a ridiculous thing to 
eat fttid enjoy calves, liver and shrink from eat- 
ing calves brains. And calves brains, too, have 
the merit of being inexpensive — a rare merit in 
these days of soaring prices. In our own home, 
they have been served and enjoyed by people 
who might have tiu'ned up their noses had they 
known what they were eating ( a small decep- 
tion, which is quite permissible in proving the 
point that they are a real delicacy) . 

This recipe, calling for one pair of calves 
brains, is a generous portion for two. 

1 pair brains 

9 cups peas (or can of peas) 

1 teaspoon salt 

Few grains of pepper 

1 tablespoon butter 

1 tablespoon vinegar 

1 bay leaf 



62 MEATLESS RECIPES 

Boil the brains in one quart of water, with 
one teaspoonful of salt, one bay leaf and a 
tablespoonful of vinegar, for one hour. Re- 
move the skim. 

Make a sauce by browning four tablespoon- 
f uls of butter and adding four tablespoonf uls 
of vinegar. 

Moisten the cooked brains with a little of this 
sauce; sprinkle a few crumbs on top ; and broil 
until a light brown. 

Serve on rye bread toast, and garnish with 
the peas. 

Pour the remaining hot butter sauce over 
the brains just before serving.

Boil all together for one-half hour. Strain

skimmed milk cheese and stir until smooth. 

Poach six eggs and place on six slices of

This is a war time recipe because it is a meat 
substitute, or meat extender. A meal con- 
taining this dish need have no meat. Note 
the cheese is skimmed milk cheese. It gives 
the flavor but saves full cream milk for the

SALADS IN WAR TIME 



We serve the Railroad, Fuel and Food Adminis- 
trators all three at one time by using salads. Isn't 
such a service worthy of cultivation? For salads 
are made from things that grow nearby and do not 
have to be carried a long haul before they reach 
your table; and every inch of space in freight cars 
that you release for coal or war essentials serves a 
big purpose. Salads are nourishing, for they are 
made with olive oil, a vegetable fat; and when you 
eat vegetable fat, you require less meat fat like ba- 
con or beef which we must release for use overseas. 
Why not serve these three important officers of our 
Government and use salads often!

FOR FRUIT SALADS 

Mayonnaise as above is too firm to be nice 
for certain salads, such as fruits; or dry vege- 
tables, such as potato. The above mayonnaise 
should be thinned with just a little cream- 
sweet or whipped cream or even a little sour 
cream — ^but care must be taken not to add too 
much. A teaspoonful will thin it down very 
much.

Russian dressing makes a very appetizing 
change from French dressing — on hearts of

mix four tablespoonfuls of chili sauce and a 
tiny dash of Worcestershire sauce just before 
serving.

LETTUCE 

As in nearly every salad lettuce or some 
green leaf is used, it is wise to begin by de- 
scribing how lettuce should be cared for. When 
served it should be clean, crisp and dry. There- 
fore, it should be carefully picked apart and 
washed as soon as it comes into the house ; then 
shaken gently in a cloth to dry it, and wrapped 
lightly in cheese-cloth and put in the ice-box. 
It then will be crisp and clean and dry when- 
ever wanted.

POTATO SALAD 

Potato salad is tel^y good with sardines or

recipe for which is- given in this chapter — 
thiimed with a little sweet or sour cream. 

It is best to make this salad and keep it on 
ice two or three hours before serving, so that 
the potatoes absorb the dressing Mid the salad 
is thoroughly chilled.

STUFFED PEACH SALAD 

For this salad, use cottage cheese, which can 
be made at home as described in Chapter VII, 
or purchased ready-made. Do not use cream 
cheese, as just now the butter fats in cream 
cheese should be conserved for the use of chil- 
dren and invalids. 

Peel and cut large fresh peaches (if out of 
season, use canned peaches) in half, removing 
the stone. Mix a few chopped salted pecans 
or any salted nuts into the cottage cheese, and 
fill each pit hole with this mixture. 

Place the stuffed peaches on lettuce leaves. 
Pour French dressing carefully over each one; 
then put a small spoonful of mayonnaise on 
top — ^not covering the cheese entirely; a dash 
of paprika, and they are ready to serve. 

Buttered Graham or other brown crackers 
warmed in the oven till crisp are a very nice 
war time cracker to serve with this salad. 

Pears or pineapple may be used in place of 
peaches to vary this salad. Made from any 
of them, it is delicious and very pretty to 
look at.

gether. If too thick a paste, thin with a little

Then cut the stuffed stalks in half-inch

For this salad any vegetables can be used

to make a dish in themselves. Cold string 
beans, brussels sprouts, peas, lima beans, beets, 
potatoes and uncooked cabbage — ^any or all of 
these. 

Mix them together (the larger vegetables 
such as potatoes and beets should be cubed and 
the cabbage should be shredded) with a little 
French dressing to moisten it well. Place in 
a deep bowl which l|as been rubbed with a gar- 
lic clove, or onion; cover the top with mayon- 
naise; and decorate with lettuce or watercress 
and a few peas or sweet red or green peppers.

GREEN VEGETABLE SALAD 

For this salad any or all of the following 
vegetables may be used : cucumbers ; tomatoes, 
sliced ; sweet or new spring onions ; green pep-

Choose a large lettuce leaf and place it in 
the center of the platter; fill full with mayon- 
naise dressing. Group the other vegetables — 
each one separate from the other — around the 
dressing. Slice the cucumbers; quarter the 
tomatoes; leave a little green on the radishes 
and onions* Four a little French dressing 
over them all. 

When salad is arranged in this way, those 
who choose to do so can omit the onions. 



WHEATLESS CAKES, BREADS AND 

PIES 



Because most wheat substitutes cost more, it does 
not necessarily follow that the household budget will 
be increased. Some flours, notably potato, go much 
farther than wheat, so it really is less expensive in 
the end. I maintain that when we buy the ^Substi- 
tute" we do only half our duty, the other half being 
to use all we buy and waste not a scrap; make things 
so good that every bit will be eaten. In our reck- 
less, American way, we have allowed food to be 
wasted because it was cheap or because we thought 
it niggardly to be too careful. Now all that is 
changed. We must not waste, and that means we 
must buy only what we can use entirely before it 
becomes too old to eat. If we do what I call the 
''other half of food conservation, that is waste 
nothing, our food budget will not increase so alarm- 
ingly.

Cook the maple sugar and the water, or the 
syrup, till the thermometer registers 280 de-

the kettle when the syrup is first placed on 
stove. (Lacking a thermometer, the sjrrup 
may be tested by dropping a little of it into a 
cup of cold water. When thick enough to be 
picked up in a soft ball, it is done.) 

Remove from the fire; take out the ther- 
mometer; let the syrup stand about two min- 
utes; then pour a little at a time on the well- 
beaten egg whites, beating hard. A Dover

WHEATLESS PASTRY 

Wheatless pastry is not like the pie we made from 
white wheat flour, but it is tender and has a nutty 
flavor that is pleasant. It is rather difficult to 
handle, as it breaks apart easily when rolled thin. 
I therefore recommend the substitution of tarts, in- 
dividual pies, or pies without top crust, when mak- 
ing wheatless pastry. 



WHEATLESS PUMPKIN PIE 

For one large pie, use : 

S cups pumpkin 

8 eggs

S tablespoons ice-cold water 

Sift the two flours and salt together. Cut 
into it the shortening, using a knife, until it 
is in tiny bits. Then rub together lightly with 
the hands until all ingredients are weU blended ; 
then add the water, mixing as little as possible. 

Mold into a ball. Place on a floured bread- 
board and roll as thinly as possible. Fold 
over rolling-pin and lift into pie tin, pressing 
edges firmly into place, trimming the uneven 
edges. Fill with above piunpkin mixture and 
bake in a moderate oven about fifteen minutes.

WHEATLESS FRUIT TARTS 

PASTRY SHELLS 

1^ cups barley flour 
^ cup com flour (not cornstarch) 

1 teaspoon salt

4 tablespoons ice-cold water 

Sift the two flours and salt together ; cut into 
it the shortening, using a knife, until it is in 
tiny bits. Then rub together lightly with the 
hands until all the ingredients are well blended. 
Now add the water, mixing as little as possible. 

Mold into a ball. Place on a well-floured

the rolling-pin. 

Cut with a large biscuit-cutter and place 
over bottoms of muflSn tins.

When cold, fill the shells with fruit filling. 

FRUIT FILLING FOR TARTS 

Use rhubarb, strawberries, cherries, rasp- 
berries or currants. 



WHEATLESSCAKE, BREAD, PIE 125 

Canned fruit may be used in winter, but as 
they are sweetened, reduce the sugar quantity 
one-half. 

1 quart fruit (any of the above varieties) 
1 cup maple sugar (crushed) 
% cup water 
8 level tablespoons cornstarch 

Boil until the fruit is tender. Then add 
three level tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, dis- 
solved in a tablespoonful of water. Boil 
slowly, stirring constantly, for about five min- 
utes longer. 

When cold, fill the tart molds and serve.

WHEATLESS APPLE PIE 

S cups barley flour 
1^ teaspoons salt 
% cup hard vegetable shortening 
4 to 6 tablespoons beaten egg 

Cut the shortening into the mixed flour and 
salt with a knife, then rub together lightly by 
hand until all is well mixed. Add the egg. 
Try four tablespoonfuls first; if not moist 
enough to handle, add more. 

Roll out on flour-dusted bread-board. Fold 
over rolling-pin and lift into pie tin. The- 
broken spots can be mended with a little of the 
pastry, as one would putty up a crack. 

Peel, core and slice three quarts of green- 
ing apples. If apples are green or new, use 
two cups of shaved or grated maple sugar; if 
old apples, use one and one-half cups. 

Sprinkle bottom of the pie crust with two 
tablespoonfuls of the maple sugar and about 
a tablespoonf ul of flour. Put in about half of 
the apples; sprinkle with sugar and add the 
balance of the apples and aU the rest of the

TEA BISCUIT 

The tea biscuit in this recipe requires a little 
wheat flour, but the amount is so small (one- 
third) that the recipe will be useful when a 
small amount of wheat is available. These bis- 
cuit are quite as nice as any baking-powder 
biscuit made entirely from wheat and are for 
this reason particularly desirable for straw- 
berry shortcakes, chicken fricassee, and to serve 
as a bread substitute. 

1 cup freshly mashed or riced potato 

1 cup rice flour 

1 cup wheat flour 

8 teaspoons baking powder 

1 teaspoon salt 

1 tablespoon vegetable shortening 

1 cup milk 

Sift the flours, baking powder and salt well 
together. Cut in the shortening into small bits. 
When all is well mixed in, add the milk. 

Mix until smooth and turn out on a floured 
bread-board. Roll to the thickness of an inch. 
Cut with a biscuit-cutter and place in a but- 
tered tin.

FRUIT ICES— SUGARLESS 

The U. S. Food Administration has asked 
all ice-cream manufacturers to discontinue 
making water-ices, because they require so 
much sugar. However, water-ices made with 
honey are entirely permissible and are '^good 
food conservation/' as they use fresh fruit, and 
no sugar. 

For making fruit ice, one should have a 
small cooking thermometer (these cost about 
$1.25 to $1.50 each), as it is impossible to test 
the syrup accurately without one; and upon 
the correct density of the syrup depends the 
smoothness of the ice. The syrup should be 
well boiled up, but not firm enough to be found 
in cold water when tested in that way.

When cold, add loganberry and lemon juice 
and freeze. (Use two-thirds ice and one-third 
coarse salt; water-ices require more salt in 
freezing than ice-creams.) 

Serve on a slice of orange, and decorate with 
a sprig of green.

in France. I loved this dessert in France, and 
so I brought it home with me. And now, 
when we should eat less pastry and cake and 
ice-cream, it serves a double purpose.) 

Put a pound of large Italian chestnuts into 
the oven for a mc^ment until the shell and inner 
skin can be easily removed. 

Boil the chestnuts in water, with three table- 
spoonfuls of honey and a generous pinch of 
salt, until they are very tender. 

Add one-half cup of honey; let it come to a 
boil; remove from the fire and let stand until 
thoroughly cold. 

Remove from the syrup (save a few large 
pieces for decoration) and run through a 
potato ricer onto a platter; mounding it high. 

Top it all with sweetened whipped cream 
(use strained honey to taste) and put a little 
cream around the edge of the dish — dotting it

SPICED LEMONADE 

^ teaspoon whole allspice

A small piece of stick cinnamon 

Put the spices into one quart of cold water 
and bring to a good boil. When cold, make

a slice of lemon, having a clove stuck in its 
center, a stick of whole cinnamon decorated 
with fresh mint, and a plentiful supply of

SPARKLE PUNCH 

Put a large piece of solid ice in the punch 
bowl. 

To each bottle of ice-cold ginger ale — extra 
dry is best — use the juice of one orange and 
one lemon; pour over the ice as soon as the 
ginger ale is opened. If the ale is ice-cold 
before making punch, it will retain its sparkle 
until all is served. 

This is a very delicious punch for dances, as 
it is sparkling and not too sweet.

COTTAGE CHEESE 

Cottage cheese we are urged by the Gov- 
ernment to use in place of cream cheese. It 
is easily made at home from milk or cream 
that has become sour and might otherwise not 
be used. To iise everything we buy for food 
is an important part of food conservation — 
and it is the only way in which we can econo- 
mize in these days of high prices. 

There are many ways in which cottage 
cheese is deliciously served. I have here illus- 
trated it served with a sweet as dessert. This 
cheese needs cream or other fats to make it 
richly delicious; but as cream is one of the 
things we are asked to conserve, I find it splen- 
did when moistened with salad oil — seasoned 
with salt and a dash of paprika. You may 
wish to serve it with a salad; in which case, add 
chopped parsley, chives or olives, and roll into 
small balls. 

Pour three quarts of boiling water on three 
quarts of sour lobbered milk. Let it stand a 
few minutes, then pour into cheese-doth and 
drain over night. Another way is to heat the 



160 BEVERAGES, RELISHES, ETC. 

sour lobbered milk to blood heat or lukewarm, 
and keep it at this temperature (no warmer) 
until the curd forms and comes to the top ; then 
strain into a cloth to dram. The first way is 
safer, for if you heat the milk a bit too warm, 
the curd will be hard and not soft and creamy.

RHUBARB CONSERVE 

Boil for twenty minutes, four pounds of 
rhubarb cut into small pieces, leaving the skin 
on. 

Add the juice of five lemons and the rind, 
which has been sliced off thinly and boiled in 
a little water for about twenty minutes, or 
until soft, then chopped fine. 

To this add six pounds of light maple sugar, 
one pound of blanched almonds, chopped or 
cut, and one wine-glass of Jamaica ginger. 

Boil all together until thick. 

The almonds may be omitted, if desired, and 
still leave a delicious marmalade.

CUCUMBER PICKLES 

We ought to make our own pickles and use 
them in place of oliveSt which have to be trans- 
ported so great a distance, thus helping to 
congest our railroads in war time. Use things 
near at hand for f ood, so railroads can be used 
for necessities such as coal and munitions. 

1 gallon Tinegar 
1 cup salt 
1 cup mustard 

Stand the vinegar on the stove until it comes 
to a boil ; when perfectly cold add the salt and 
mustard. Should the vinegar be very strong, 
reduce one-half with cold water before adding 
the salt and mustard. 

Select cucumbers two to three inches long- 
Scrub them thoroughly with a vegetable 
brush; wipe with a cloth and pack in jars. 
Fill with vinegar mixture and seal. 

A little fresh horseradish added to each jar 
improves the flavor. 

These pickles will keep hard and crisp for 
two years, are easy to make and very delicious.
