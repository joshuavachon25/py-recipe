PREFACE 

~\URING the last five years my work in Fins- 

L^ bury has necessitated a careful study of the 

j problem of infant mortality. This book is part of 

the outcome. It is an attempt to state in a plain 

| way the chief facts concerning a question which 

I is not without national importance. 

The young of all animals are more susceptible 
than the adult to the influence of environment and 
the approach of death. Hence, it is inevitable that, 
even under the most favourable circumstances, the 
deaths of infants will furnish a large contribution to 
the bills of mortality. AS civilisation advances, 
however, this should become less. That it does 
not, in fact, become substantially less is surely a 
matter calling for consideration, for at the present 
time there is an annual loss to England and Wales 
of 120,000 lives by the death of infants. In past 
years there has been a similar drain upon the 
national resources of life. But it should not be 
forgotten that a rapidly declining birth-rate means 
that this loss of life is now operating in conjunction 
with a diminished income. 

Nor is this all. For it cannot be too distinctly 
recognised, as Sir John Simon pointed out, that 
a high infant mortality rate almost necessarily 
denotes a prevalence of those causes and con-

ditions which in the long run determine a 
degeneration of race ; and further, that a high 
death-rate of infants is an indication of t 
existence of evil conditions in the homes of the 
peoplewhich are, after all, the vitals of the nation. 
Poverty is not alone responsible, for in many poor 
communities the infant mortality is low. Housing 
and external environment alone do not cause it, for 
under some of the worst external conditions in the 
world the evil is absent. It is difficult to escape 
the conclusion that this loss of infant life is in 
some way intimately related to the social life of 

the people. . 

It only remains for me to add a word of sincere 
gratitude and appreciation to those who have 
advised me or furnished me with facts not other- 
wise obtainable. The reader will soon discover 
how numerous are those to whom I am indebted, 
but I must particularly mention my obligations 
to Dr. Tatham, of the Registrar- General's Office ; 
Dr. Newsholme, of Brighton ; Professor Budin, of 
Paris ; Dr. Niven, of Manchester ; Dr. Robertson, 
of Birmingham; Dr. Leslie Mackenzie, Medical 
Member of the Local Government Board for Scot- 
land ; and Sir Shirley Murphy, the Medical Officer 
of Health of the Administrative County of London. 
It will be understood that the book is of an 
elementary character only, and it is hoped that it 
may serve as an introduction to the intricate 
problem with which it is concerned.

INFANT MORTALITY 

i 

PRESENT POSITION AND INCIDENCE OF INFANT 
MORTALITY 

THE death of infants in relation to a community is 
gauged by a form of death rate known as the 
infantile mortality rate. Infants are children under 
twelve months of age, and the infant mortality rate is 
the proportion which the deaths of such infants bears to 
every thousand births. An ordinary death rate is the 
proportion which the total deaths of a community bears 
to a thousand of the population in such a community. 
But it is clear that a more accurate death rate for infants 
is obtained if we compare the total number of infant deaths 
not to a thousand of the general population but to a 
thousand births in the same year. In some places this 
is a low rate such as 80 per 1,000 births, which means, 
of course, that for every thousand children born in a year 
80 die before they are twelve months old. In other places 
it is found that this infant mortality rate is high, say 200 
or 250 per 1,000. A low rate, other things being equal, 
indicates a healthy community, a high rate the reverse. 
As communal life becomes more healthy and civilised it 



2 INFANT MORTALITY 

is observed that the ordinary death rate steadily declines, 
and also the death rate of the more preventable dis- 
eases ; and acting on that principle it seems reasonable 
to expect that the infant death rate will follow a similar 
course. 

The first broad fact of importance with regard to this 
problem, indeed the fact which creates the problem, is 
that though the general death rate is decreasing the infant 
mortality rate is not declining. This means that whilst 
during the last half-century, a time of marvellous growth 
of science and of preventive medicine, human life has 
been saved and prolonged, and death made more remote 
for the general population, infants still die every year 
much as they did in former times. Indeed, in many 
places it appears that they die in greater numbers, and 
more readily than in the past. But a nation grows out of 
its children ; and if its children die in thousands in infancy 
it means that the sources of a nation's population are being 
sapped, and further that the conditions which kill such a 
large proportion of infants injure many of those which 
survive. Last year (1905) there was a loss to the nation 
of 120,000 dead infants in England and Wales alone, a 
figure which is almost exactly one quarter of all the 
deaths in England and Wales in that year. That is to 
say, that one quarter of the total deaths every year is of 
children under the age of twelve months. And this 
enormous sacrifice of human life is being repeated year 
by year, and is not growing less. 1 

In the following table will be seen the decennial death 
rates for the whole population and for infants, both in 
England and Wales and in London. For convenience 

1 In 1903 in England there were 514,628 deaths, of which 124,718, or 
24 per cent., were infants under twelve months of age ; in London there 
were 70,281 deaths, of which 24 per cent, were infants. In 1904 there 
were 549,784 deaths, of which 137,392, or 25 per cent., were infants.

Now, if we take the present population of England and 
Wales at 34,000,000 persons we shall realise something of 
the meaning of this table. A simple calculation gives us 
nearly a million births every year, more than half a million 
deaths every year, and out of that half million deaths at 
least 120,000 dead infants a vast army of small human 
beings that lived but a handful of days. And this series 
of events, so difficult to make real to the mind, recurs 
annually. 

So much for the actual facts of life and death which 
the figures, as rates, represent. But the table has other 
lessons to teach. First, the birth rate is decreasing ; for 
proportionately to the population there were four births 
less in every thousand persons in 1905 than there were for 
the same number of persons in 1851. If the birth rate 
were the same to-day as it was in the middle of last 

1 From 1832-50 the average infant mortality in England and Wales 
was 153. 

2 From 1841-50 the death rate was 24-8 and the infant mortality 
rate 157.

century there would be every year more than 60,000 
additional infants born. 1 

Secondly, the general death rate is declining, there 
being 4 deaths per 1,000 less than half a century ago; 
therefore, whether the whole country be taken or only 
London, there has been a marked saving of life. 
Newsholme expresses it as follows : 

"The general death rate at all ages has declined 14 per 
cent, among males and 19 per cent, among females between 
the decennial period 1851 to 1860, and the quinquennial 
period 1896 to 1900, while the infantile mortality has 
remained stationary. The following table is of interest 
as showing the portions of life which have enjoyed the 
greatest decline of death-rate in the two periods under 
comparison (1851-1860 and 1896-1900):

1 The Registrar-General states that approximately 70 per cent, of the 
decrease in the birth rate during the last thirty-five years results from the 
decreased fertility of married women, which is due in part to changes in 
their age constitution ; that about io per cent, may be ascribed to the 
decrease of illegitimacy (which has fallen since 1870-72 by about 28 per 
cent.) ; and that the remaining 20 per cent, is due to the decrease in the 



POSITION OF INFANT MORTALITY 5 

"Thus, with the exception of ages 45 to 75 among 
men, and 45 to 55 among women, there has been a 
great reduction in the death rate from all causes in the 
aggregate. The greatest reduction of death rate in both 
sexes has been at ages 5 to 25, at which ages the average 
reduction is not far from 50 per cent. At ages 35 to 45, it 
is still very considerable, and there is evidence of consider- 
able improvement so far as women over 65 and men over 
75 years of age are concerned. At ages under 5 an 
improvement of 14 to 16 per cent, is shown. As the 
death rate of infants has not improved, it follows that in 
children, between I and 5 years of age, the prospects of 
survival have improved even more than is indicated by 
the above percentage reductions. The causes of increased 
death rate in men from 45 to 75 years of age are not far 
to seek. They are doubtless connected with the increased 
preponderance of urban life and of indoor occupations, 
without corresponding sanitary precautions. It is satis- 
factory to find that when 1871 to 1880 is compared 
with 1896 to 1900, there has been a considerable decline 
of the death rate at these, as well as at other ages, show- 
ing that improved conditions of life are being made to 
overcome, at these ages, the evils associated with increased 

proportion of married women in the female population of conceptive 
ages. Apart from the variations in the physiological, social, and 
economic conditions of the people, and the greater use of artificial means 
to secure a restricted fertility, the principal factors that exert an influence 
on the birth rate are (a) variations in the proportion of women of con- 
ceptive ages in the population, (b) variations in the marriage rate, and 
(c) variations in the age-constitution of married women. Although the 
number of women of conceptive ages in proportion to the total popula- 
tion has increased in the two last decennia, the proportion of married 
women aged 15-45 years to the total female population has not materially 
altered. On the other hand, the marriage rate has fallen continuously 
since 1871, and the marriage age has been postponed, thus curtailing the 
period within which children can be born. During the last thirty years 
the actual rate of reproduction in the towns was some 15 to 18 per cent, 
greater than the rate in country districts, but the relative fertility of 
women "living in the country was about 10 per cent, greater than that of 
women residing in towns. (See Sixty-Seventh Ann. Rep. of Registrar- 
General, 1904, pp. xviii.-xxv.J.

aggregation of communities in towns. But in infancy it is 
otherwise. The infantile population has not shared in the 
general improvement at other ages." * 

The third fact is that which has already been stated. 
There has been no change in the infant death rate. In Eng- 
land and Wales it is stationary, and this notwithstanding 
the fact that there has been an enormous improvement in 
sanitation and in the standard of comfort of the people. 
Such improvements have had a direct influence on the total 
death rate. Further, they have also exerted, as we shall see, 
a direct and favourable effect on some of the diseases of 
infants. Yet the deaths of infants still continue at the old 
high rate, one in six dying before it is twelve months of age.

In making comparison of infant mortality rates in various countries it 
is necessary to remember the varying significance of still-born infants.

Nor is England alone. We have not the same complete 
statistical return in other countries as we have for the 
United Kingdom. But such returns as are available (see 
preceding page) tell the same story. (See Appendix, p. 
328, for returns for 1904.) 

The birth rate is declining in civilised nations with few 
exceptions ; the same may be said of the death rate. But 
the infant mortality rate, as a rule, is stationary or even 
increasing. In the Australian Commonwealth, New Zea- 
land, Ireland, Norway and Sweden, the Netherlands, 
Switzerland and Denmark it shows signs of decreasing, 
and in several of these last-named countries the death rate 
of infants falls to a comparatively low figure. In Ireland 
it is 96, in Norway 94, and in New Zealand it stands at the 
proud figure of 8 1. But these are the exceptions. Inforeign 
countries as a rule, the infant mortality rate is higher than 
in Great Britain, and in some countries, as Austria, Russia, 
and Chili, it reaches extremely high figures. 1

infant mortality of several European countries for each sex :

The birth rate and the infant mortality rate were, with few exceptions, 
slightly higher throughout from 1871-83. 

If we compare the figures of the infant mortality rate in 
the above table with similar returns for New South Wales 



higher than in temperate climates. In India they vary enormously, being 
in few districts as low as 200, and in some regions rising to 400 per 1,000 
births. In the Malay States the infant mortality is usually about one-third 
of the total births. In. Fiji and Sierra Leone it is somewhat higher. In 
British Guiana the still-births are usually above 10 per cent, for the whole 
colony, and higher in Georgetown. The infant mortality is rarely below 
200. A marked rise in mortality usually occurs about the ninth day of 
life, due to trismus neonatorum. Sometimes as much as 9 or 10 per cent, 
of all children born alive die within twenty-four hours. Prematurity, 
dietetic diseases, pulmonary conditions, and malarial diseases are the 
chief causes of infant mortality in the tropics. Owing to absence of 
accurate statistics it is impossible to compare the mortality of infants in 
the tropics with the United Kingdom. (See Trans, of Epidem. Society of 
London, 1902, vol. xxi. p. 90. Daniels.)

Thus it appears that even in communities where the 
infant mortality rate is comparatively low it is, with few 
exceptions, stationary, and tends to rise in urban districts. 
It will be necessary to consider this latter point subse- 
quently.

New Zealand furnishes the lowest national infant 
mortality rate, and it will be convenient to look some- 
what more closely at its return. In the Fifth Annual 
Report of Dr. Malcolm Mason, the Chief Health Officer 
of the Colony, for 1904, it is pointed out that 79 out 
of every 1,000 male children born and 62 of every 1,000 
female children are found to have died before attaining 
the age of twelve months. The mortality is thus one in 
thirteen for boys and one in sixteen for girls, and the 
total infant mortality during the last decennium (1895- 
1904) is 80 per 1,000 births. In 1904 it fell to the almost 
ideal figure of 71. The infant deaths since 1895 may be 
set out as in table at foot of p. 9. 

The above table is interesting not only as exhibiting 
a low and declining infant mortality rate, but for the 
revelation it yields as to the age incidence of death within 
the twelve months of infancy. If the number of deaths 
in each trimester, or three-month period, be turned into 
percentages on total infant deaths, it will become clear 
that not only is there a marked incidence of death on 
infants but on infants within the first months of life:

POSITION OF INFANT MORTALITY 11 

This is a very interesting but in no way exceptional 
result. In England and Wales in 1904, the latest available 
figures, there were 137,392 deaths of infants, of whom 
67,021 died in the first trimester, 28,478 in the second, and 
41,893 in the last six months. This yields a percentage in 
the first trimester of 49, in the second 21, and in the last 
two trimesters 30. In London in the same year the per- 
centages were 47 in the first trimester, 21 in the second, 
and 32 in the last six months. 1 

If now we go a step further and take the first month 
of the twelve let us say for New Zealand it will be 
seen that a higher percentage of infants die in that month 
than in any other month, or indeed in any trimester of the 
twelve, excluding the first month. And the same has 
been shown to be the case in this country for many 
years past. Dr. Farr pointed this out in 1864 in the 
following table of the Annual Rate Mortality per cent, at 
each month in first year 2 :

INFANT MORTALITY 



rapidly declines from month to month, and that the 
mortality of boys in every month exceeds that of girls, so 
that at the end of the first year the number of boys does 
not greatly exceed the number of girls. In France the 
mortality of infants was such that in 1856 the rate was 
154 per cent, per annum (on children born) in the first 
seven days of life, 120 in the second week, and 54 in 
the sixteen days following. 

In the report of the decenniad following a further table 
was issued revealing a similar condition of things, except 
that children under 5 years of age were grouped together 
and compared with the rest of the population. It was 
there shown that over a period of 34 years (1838-1871) 
the male children under 5 had a percentage mortality of 
7-26, and the female children 6-27 compared with an 
average percentage mortality of 2-3 and 2'i respectively at 
all ages. Nor were these figures of 7'2 and 6'2 respectively 
approached again until age periods beyond 75 years. 1 

If, bearing this incidence in mind, we make comparisons 
between the present time and the past, we shall find not 
only that the fatal incidence falls upon the first months, but 
that it falls there in ever-increasing proportion. This 
point is clearly brought out by Dr. Sykes of St. Pancras, 
where he has compared the infant mortality rates of 1876 
with those of 1901 at each of the four trimesters in the first 
year of life. 2 The results are as follows :

This, however, is only for one year. But since 1888 the 
Registrar-General has furnished returns of infant deaths in 
three periods of the first and second three months and the 
last six months of the first year, which, as Dr. Sykes points 
out, yield a like return. 1

1 Similar returns are available for Manchester and Glasgow. In the 
former city there has been a steady though not a marked increase of 
infant deaths in the first three months. In 1895 42 per cent, of all the 
infant deaths occurred in the first trimester, but in 1904 45 per cent., and 
in 1905 49 per cent. In Glasgow the infant mortality rate for 1870-72 and 
1900-2 in the first trimester are the same, namely, 72, but there has been 
a marked decline in the second trimester and the last six months of the 
first year of life. The comparative figures, which are full of interest, are 
as follows :

Thus a reduction of 15 per cent, in the total infant mortality resolves 
itself into a reduction of 30 per cent, in the last six months, 16 per cent. 
in the second three months, and an almost stationary rate in the first 
three months of life. (Public Health, 1906, vol. xviii., No. 7, p. 423.)

not take us far enough back.

This furnishes a comparison across sixty years for the 
whole of London. In 1839-44 the infants' deaths contri- 
buted 20 per centage of the deaths of all persons. Sixty 
years later that ratio had increased to 25 per cent, which was 
in itself an increase of 25 per cent, on the 1839-44 returns. 
Further, the infant mortality rate under three months of 
age at the end of the sixty years show a 5 per cent, in- 
crease over the former period, even on a lower total rate. 
Nothing could show more clearly the broad changes which 
have been taking place than these figures. 



The general deductions to be drawn from all these figures 
are clear. In the first place the chief fatality of the first 
year is not uniformly distributed, but falls in the first three 
months. Secondly, the change that has been taking place 
and which is so well illustrated in the comparative figures 
in the above tables, is that there has been an increase in 
the deaths in the first trimester, accompanied by a 



POSITION OF INFANT MORTALITY 15 

decrease^ or at least an almost stationary position, in the 
last two trimesters of the first year of life. The St. Pan- 
eras figures show a fall in the last quarter of 6 per 1,000, 
and a rise in the first quarter of 8*4 per 1,000. In the 
returns for England and Wales and for London we see 
that the total infant mortality has increased on the whole 
twelve months, but more so in the first half than the 
second, and more so in the first trimester than in the second. 
The returns for London (1839-1903) and for Manchester 
and Glasgow speak for themselves of the increased inci- 
dence on the first three months, or the decrease in the 
later months. Thirdly, when the returns of the first 
quarter and of the first month are examined it will be 
found that within the first quarter the rise has been 
almost wholly in the first month and within the first month 
almost wholly in the first week. These changes indicate 
what Dr. Sykes calls "an increased immaturity of infants 
at birth." The connotation of which phrase means that 
infants die more from immaturity (premature birth) at the 
present time than formerly, and therefore more of the 
survivors start life handicapped by immaturity than 
formerly. In other words, infants are dying earlier and 
earlier, and therefore the cause of death whatever it 
be is operating on the survivors at the commencement 
of life, which renders them more susceptible to un- 
favourable influences in later years. What those causes 
and conditions are it will be necessary to consider 
subsequently. 

One further purely statistical point remains. It has 
relation to the infant mortality rate of legitimate as com- 
pared with illegitimate infants, or children born out of 
wedlock. Dr. Tatham has drawn up tables for the year 
1902 to show the facts in regard to this matter, 1 and brief 

1 Report of Inter depart. Com. on Physical Deterioration, 1904, vol. i. 
PP. 133-136.

INFANT MORTALITY 



reference must now be made to his summary of infant 
deaths per 1,000 births at the several age periods under 
one year. For comparative purposes he selected London 
as an example of urban environment (with not less than 
1 30,000 births) and certain counties of England as rural 
environment 1 (with not less than 100,000 births).

We may conveniently read this summarised table com- 
mencing with the totals at the foot. From these totals 
the first fact becomes evident, namely, that infant mortality 
rate for males and females in London or in rural counties 
is enormously greater among illegitimate infants than 
among legitimate. In 1902 there were in London 690 
deaths out of 2,385 illegitimate male infants (yielding the 

1 Bucks, Cambridge, Cornwall, Hereford, Hunts, Lincoln, North Wales, 
Norfolk, Oxford, Rutland, Somerset, Salop, South Wales (less Glamorgan), 
Suffolk, Westmoreland, and Wilts. Estimated population in 1902,

POSITION OF INFANT MORTALITY 17 

exceptional death rate of 289*3, as compared with I5i'2) 
and 612 out of 2,317 illegitimate female infants (infant 
mortality rate, 264-1). In the rural counties under con- 
sideration the same comparison holds good, though in less 
degree. 

The next fact which becomes clear is that the incidence 
of fatality becomes much more marked, without excep- 
tion, in the first three months period, and of that period 
most marked in the first month, and of that first month 
most marked in the first week. It is precisely the same 
finding as before, but is, in all cases, of illegitimates more 
marked than in legitimates. The diseases which carry off 
illegitimate children at such an increased rate over legiti- 
mate children will be considered at a later stage. Here it 
is only necessary to observe (a) that the mortality of ille- 
gitimate infants is much greater than the mortality of 
legitimate infants ; () that the illegitimate mortality of 
London is greater than that of the rural counties ; (c) that 
the illegitimate mortality in London is twice as great 
as the legitimate mortality ; and (d) that in all cases the 
mortality of illegitimate infants is proportionately greater 
earlier in life than that of legitimate infants. It should be 
added that there is reason to believe that this excessive 
mortality among illegitimate infants in London is under- 
stated, for it is a known fact that many unmarried 
women who reside outside London are admitted to 
London hospitals at the time of confinement and the 
births are registered in London. But most of the 
mothers return again to the country, and any deaths of 
their children a few weeks after birth are, in all probability, 
registered outside London. 

SUMMARY. 

We have seen that the general death rate from all 
causes in this country and most other civilised countries 



18 INFANT MORTALITY 

is slowly but surely declining. That is a favourable 
sign, which means that fewer persons per 1,000 are dying 
within an annual period and more persons are living for a 
longer span of life. It does not necessarily mean that 
men are living a healthier physical life, though in all 
probability that also is involved. The birth rate is de- 
clining in most civilised states, which is an unfavour- 
able sign. 

The infant mortality rate, on the other hand, is not 
declining, and this is the broad fact which constitutes 
the problem to be considered. Children under twelve 
months of age die in England to-day, in spite of all our 
boasted progress and in spite of an immense improvement 
in the social and physical life of the people, as greatly as 
they did seventy years ago. Nor is England alone. Over 
all the continent of Europe there are but four States 
with a lower infant mortality rate than that of the 
British Islands. To find healthy rates elsewhere we 
must take the wings of the morning to the new lands 
of the Australian Commonwealth and the island of New 
Zealand. But even so we shall not wholly escape our 
problem. 

Further, we have seen that the incidence of death in 
infancy is not equally or uniformly distributed, but falls 
in exceptional measure on the first weeks and months of 
life, having a tendency to fall earlier rather than later, and 
carrying off more boys than girls. That there is here 
something in operation outside the laws of nature becomes 
certain when we find that infant mortality is enormously 
increased in illegitimately born infants as compared with 
legitimate. 

These are the ground facts of the problem. It is expe- 
rience of them which makes it true to say that in England 
and Wales out of 100,000 infants born 17,139 will not live 
to their first birthday, and nearly 25,000 will succumb

before their fifth, 1 and that the nation is suffering a dead 
loss every year of not less than 120,000 lives under twelve 
months of age. 

1 Subsequently we shall see how greatly increased those figures become 
in certain towns. 



II 



THE DISTRIBUTION OF INFANT MORTALITY IN 
GREAT BRITAIN 

WHEN we turn to examine the geographical distri- 
bution of the infant mortality rate in the United 
Kingdom for any year we find at once that it is not 
uniform. Some parts of the country show a high rate, 
others a low rate. So greatly, in fact, does the infant 
mortality vary that it is impossible to form any reliable 
opinion except on broad lines. Such broad measurements 
must be taken in two directions. First it is necessary to 
judge by periods of five or ten years rather than by single 
years, and next it is necessary to take counties and, where 
possible, even broader areas as a basis of observation. 

The official returns of dead infants for England and 
Wales are not available in infant mortality form before 
1871. By the kindness, however, of Dr. Tatham, of the 
Registrar-General's Office, I am able to furnish a decennial 
infant mortality rate for the years 1845-54 to compare 
with the three decennial periods 1871-80, 1881-90, 1891- 
1900, and with the last quinquenniad 1901-1905. By 
means of these figures we are able to inquire into the inci- 
dence of infant mortality over a period of sixty years. 
For convenience and graphic illustration these returns 
have been charted on five maps of England. The actual 
table of returns is as follows :

22 INFANT MORTALITY 

On examining this table and these maps certain 
characteristics present themselves : 

1. There is a general similarity of incidence in all five 
periods -The actual averages may be stated for con- 
venience thus : 

1845-1854 145 

1871-1880 H9 

1882-1890 142 

1891-1900 154 

1901-1905 138 

There is therefore, to begin with, no wide divergence of 
mortality. It rose in the decennial period 1871-1880 
above the first period for which we have figures, but in 
the succeeding decennium it fell again almost to the 
former figure. In 1891-1900, however, it rose to the 
highest figure of which we have record, falling again in 
the next quinquenniad, the lowest figure of which we have 
record. 

2. There is a general similarity of distribution. The 
chief mortality occurs in the North and North-Midland 
districts, and the lowest mortality in the counties below a 
line drawn from the Wash to the mouth of the Severn. 
Each decennium shows some minor variation, but prac- 
tically it may be said that during the whole of last century 
this was in the main the general distribution. The degrees 
of severity differ, the distribution remains about the same, 
and it will be seen that it follows with some measure of 
accuracy the chief coal-fields ; or in other words, the 
imaginary line that divides the high infant mortality 
districts from the low, is the line which now divides the

agricultural from the industrial, particularly the mining 
and textile, portions of the community. 

3. Certain counties are characterised throughout by a high 
or a loiv infant mortality. Among the high-mortality 
counties are Northumberland, Durham, the East and West 
Ridings of Yorkshire, Lancashire, Cheshire, Staffordshire, 
Nottingham, Leicester, and Warwick. Among the low- 
mortality counties are Westmoreland, Wiltshire, and 
Dorset. Other counties share the credit of a low mor- 
tality in certain decennial periods, but the three named 
have almost without exception maintained a remarkably 
low infant death rate. It will be remembered that before 
the middle of the eighteenth century the distribation of 
industries in England was not circumscribed by coal- 
fields, and was much more located in Somerset, 
Gloucester, Wilts, Oxford, Bucks, Northampton, Wor- 
cester, and Warwick, than in Stafford, Nottingham, 
Cheshire, the East and West Ridings, Durham, and 
Northumberland. And it is possible that if we could 
produce an infant mortality map of England from 1738- 
1747 that is to say, before the modern industrial revo- 
lution occurred we should find considerable alteration in 
distribution. 

Now it will be noticed that the counties characterised 
by a high or low infant mortality in the last decennium 
1891-1900 are the same with few exceptions as those so 
characterised in the first decennium. The incidence 
remains high or low year after year. And the question 
naturally arises, Why should certain counties always be 
characterised by a high infant mortality ? Before attempt- 
ing to consider that question we shall do well to note the 
exceptions. Examples of increase are mainly two, North- 
umberland and South Wales. In the first decennial period 
neither of these districts was much affected. In the last 
decennial period both are marked districts, though Cum- 



24 INFANT MORTALITY 

berland and Herefordshire, immediately adjoining them, 
remain with low infant mortality. Of examples of decrease 
there are eight or ten counties, but chiefly perhaps Cam- 
bridge, Huntingdon, and Cheshire. It is noteworthy, 
however, that Lancashire and Yorkshire have also shown 
some measure of decrease. 

4. There is a fourth point of much interest and of some 
obscurity, concerning which a table will be found in the 
Appendix (see p. 333), in which will be seen the distribu- 
tion of infant deaths in counties in trimester periods. The 
figures are percentages of infant deaths at each of the three 
periods on total infant deaths for the year in each county. 
The average is 51*4 in the first trimester of life, lyg in the 
second, and 287 in the third. Subsequently we shall see 
that the causes of death in the first trimester of life are in 
the main a group of diseases concerned with immaturity 
(premature birth, early atrophy, congenital defects, &c.) ; 
the chief cause in the second trimester is epidemic 
diarrhoea ; and in the third trimester there are a variety 
of diseases, particularly of the lungs, and epidemic 
diarrhoea again. Now when we examine the figures 
in this table we find the counties with the highest 
percentage of deaths in the first trimester are as 
follows (the infant mortality figure for 1901-05 is 
inserted in brackets): Bedford (106), Wiltshire (91), 
Dorset (92), Oxford (98), Cornwall (117), and Westmore- 
land (97) that is to say, agricultural counties with excep- 
tionally low infant mortality rates. Whereas the counties 
with the lowest percentage of deaths in the first trimester 
are as follows: Lancashire (163), East Riding (152), 
Leicester (144), West Riding (154), and Cheshire (143) 
that is to say, manufacturing counties with exceptionally 
high infant mortality rates. That this is not wholly a 
question of deaths from immaturity becomes clear when we 



DISTRIBUTION OF INFANT MORTALITY 25 

study the accompanying table (in the Appendix, p. 329) as to 
causes of death in the English counties. From this table 
it will be seen that the counties with a high percentage of 
deaths in the first trimester (Bedford, Wilts, &c.) have not 
an excessively high death rate from wasting disease which 
in this table is synonymous with immaturity. Cornwall 
alone is above the average. The others are either at, or 
just below, the average. On the other hand Lancashire, 
East Riding, &c., are, with the exception of Cheshire, 
slightly above the average death rate of wasting diseases. 1 
A partial explanation of these interesting figures is to be 
found in the relative incidence of diarrhoea, convulsions, 
and respiratory diseases. But making all allowance, it is 
clear that the counties having a high percentage of deaths 
in the first trimester are characterised by a relative excess 
of deaths from immaturity. 

Returning now to the general distribution of infant 
mortality in counties, it ma'y at once be said that it is 
evident that no mere physical or geological conditions 
are operating in assisting to bring about the very 
characteristic distribution revealed by these maps. 
Geological strata, soil, and climate are not exerting the 
main influence in a distribution of death such as this. 
The climate of Lancashire, its temperature and its rainfall, 
is not greatly different from that of Cumberland, or that 

1 It is singular that the counties which in recent years have shown high 
infant death rates from " wasting diseases," that is immaturity, are Norfolk, 
Suffolk, Nottinghamshire, Warwickshire, Worcestershire, and Durham. 
The first three counties are characterised by a high illegitimate birth rate, 
the second three by a low illegitimate birth rate. The whole problem of 
the distribution of illegitimacy and mortality from immaturity in English 
counties is somewhat obscure. It might be expected that exceptionally 
high illegitimate birth rates would lead to (a) high infant mortality ; 
(6) high mortality from immaturity ; (c) a high mortality from infant 
diarrhoea and diseases due to neglect ; or (d) a high mortality from all 
three. No doubt this is often the case. But that it is not invariably so is 
evident from the experience of Herefordshire, Shropshire, and Cumberland, 
which have a high degree of illegitimacy but low infant mortality rates. 
(See also Appendix, p. 331.)

of Shropshire from Staffordshire, or that of Herefordshire 
from Warwickshire, and yet these districts are pole-wide 
asunder in regard to infant mortality. Nor is the differ- 
ence due to outward physical conditions of topography. 
Lancashire is flat and low, the West Riding of Yorkshire 
mountainous. Both are affected with a high infant 
mortality. Nor is it a question, broadly, of the environ- 
ment of different populations. In so small a country as 
England, habits and customs have, like the climate, 
much in common. People are housed much the same, 
live on the same diet, adopt the same habits, clothe 
themselves similarly, and on the whole even treat their 
infants the same. Nor is it a question of pauperism per se. 
Pauperism has greatly declined in England, for whereas 
in 1848-49 the mean number of paupers was Ygth of 
the population, it was in 1902-03 only ^th of the 
population. 1 But we can be more precise, for whilst 
the average ratio per 1,000 of paupers in 1904 in union 
counties was 26'O, it was 34-9 in Wiltshire, 40^4 in Dorset, 
and 41-0 in Herefordshire (three counties characterised 
by the lowest infant mortality rates), the highest in the 
whole country. Yet in the West Riding it was i8'2, in 
Northumberland 197, and in Lancashire 2ro per 1,000 
of the estimated population. Poverty is not satisfac- 
torily measured by pauperism, but if such be taken as 
a standard and it is an accepted standard the counties 
having least official pauperism, so to speak, are the counties 
having the highest rates of infant mortality. 2 

There are two features, however, which appear to be 
common to the high infant mortality districts, namely, a 
high density of population, and a considerable degree of 



1 Report of Local Government Board, 1902-03, p. Ixvii. 

2 There is, of course, a distinction between pauperism and poverty. 
The following table gives the proportion which the highest and lowest 
pauperism of several Union Counties in England bore to the estimated

manufacturing industry. The former will be considered 
here, the latter in another chapter. It is true that mere 
density of population is not one of the chief conditions 
giving rise to infant mortality for if that were so the 
metropolis itself would have the highest rate yet it 
cannot be denied that density of population to the acre

col. 4 only. 

The figures as to indoor paupers are merely inserted for comparative 
purposes. Differences of administration and accommodation are so con- 
siderable that indoor pauperism is no indication of district poverty. 
Probably, indeed, the only figures serving as an index of district poverty 
are those in col. 3, as col. 4 includes lunatics. We shall subsequently find 
that the relation of domestic poverty to infant mortality is much more 
intimate than official pauperism.

appears at first sight to bear some relation to the death 
rate. If the 44 counties * be classified according to their 
infant mortality rates, and the density of the population 
(acres per person) be added as recorded in the decennial 
reports of the Registrar-General for 1871-80 and 1881-90, 
it will be found that there is frequently some apparent 
relation between infant mortality and density. But this 
does not by any means always obtain. The apparent 
general result, however, becomes more obvious if the 
counties are grouped in four divisions according to their 
infant mortality : first, those above 160 infant deaths per 
1,000 births; secondly, those between 140-160; thirdly, 
those between 120-140; and lastly, those below 120. 
And if the densities of population are similarly grouped 
we obtain the following table :

It has long been recognised that density of population 
bears some relation to death rates. Dr. Farr was so con- 
vinced of the fact that within certain limits a definite 
relation subsisted between density of population and 
mortality that he devised a formula by which this relation 
in the decennary of 1861-70 could be approximately 



1 North Wales and South Wales are here considered as one county 
each. 



DISTRIBUTION OF INFANT MORTALITY 29 

shown. And though the relation is now too complex to 
admit of being expressed by any such formula, the broad 
fact remains, and the four decennial reports of the Registrar- 
General contain abundant evidence in support of it. On 
the whole, Urban England, or the more densely populated 
districts, suffers a higher death rate from all causes and a 
higher infant mortality rate than Rural England, or the 
less densely populated districts. 1 

Scotland, as we have seen, enjoys a much lower infant 
death rate than England, though it has a higher general 
death rate. If we tabulate the infant mortality for the 
counties of Scotland in the same way as we have done in 
the English counties, we shall, by reason of the figures 
which are available, carry the argument a step further. In 
the official returns contained in the Annual Reports of the 
Local Government Board for Scotland, 1899-1904, will be 
found the figures from which the following table has been 
constructed. Here we have two infant mortalities in each 
district, one for the rural county (termed landward} as 
such, one for the burghs, an urban or burghal rate. These 
have been taken out for a six-year period, 1899-1904. 
Opposite to these figures have been placed the persons per 
acre at the last census (1901), both county or landward, 



1 " It must not be supposed," wrote Dr. Ogle, " that the higher death 
rates, which go hand-in-hand with increased density of population, are 
simply the direct results of such aggregation. Doubtlessly where people 
are crowded together certain injurious conditions are produced which 
directly affect the mortality ; the air, the soil, and often the water are 
liable to be fouled ; and infectious diseases, having a shorter average 
distance to travel from individual to individual, are more readily spread 
abroad. But these direct consequences of close aggregation are probably 
as nothing in comparison with its indirect consequences or concomitants. 
The more crowded a community the greater, speaking generally, is the 
amount of abject want, of filth, of crime, of drunkenness, and of other 
excesses, the more keen is the competition, and the more feverish and 
exhausting the conditions of life. It is not so much aggregation itself, as 
these other factors which are associated with aggregation, that produce 
the high mortality of our great towns or other thickly populated areas."

From these figures we may judge and compare density 
per acre with infant mortality in both rural and urban 
districts. The most rural county, if judged by sparseness 
of population, is Sutherlandshire, which supports upon 
each acre the small fraction of a person denoted by the 
figures 0-016. The infant mortality, however, is 86, and 
there are a dozen counties with a smaller rate. Banff also 
has an infant mortality of 86, though its density per acre 
is five times greater than Sutherland. In short, we find 
as we found in England, only more so because of the 
greater scarcity of population, that the density per acre in 
the counties has no correspondence with infant mortality,

except where the county is almost wholly urban. When, 
however, we turn to the towns themselves and the 
advantage of this table is that we can compare towns with 
the counties we find a fairly close correspondence. The 
five burghal districts having the highest density per acre, 
namely, Lanark, Edinburgh, Renfrew, Forfar, and Aber- 
deen, are characterised by five of the highest infant 
mortalities, and an average of 139 as compared with 123 
for all Scotland. 

From a study of these facts it is becoming evident that 
whatever may be the relation existing between density of 
persons per acre and the infant death rate in counties, it 
is an effect of the towns* Very small towns do not appear 
to make much difference in the relationship, whatever it 
be. If we could, so to speak, analyse each county, as we 
have roughly differentiated England and Scotland, into 
areas of high and areas of low infant mortality, we might 
obtain further evidence, for each county would then become 
a microcosm of the conditions as we see them in England 
and Scotland as a whole. Such an examination of the 
statistical records of each county for a period of years is, 

1 In a general way this applies to the 76 large towns and the 142 smaller 
towns, but it is noticeable that in recent years (1901-05) there has been 
in the country as a whole a decline in the infant mortality rate which has 
been shared in by the largest towns but not always by the smaller towns. 
To set out this change adequately would require many pages, for which 
we have not space. In the last decennium (1891-1900) the infant mortality 
increased in the whole country and fell in the large towns, but in the 
smaller towns, in new towns, and in rural districts, it tended to rise, 
and in this way the gain of the previous decennium was lost. Hence it 
is not by any means always true to say that urban infant mortality is 
higher than rural. It may be so, and generally is so. But, on the other 
hand, some of the lowest mortalities are occurring in urban districts. And 
it must not be forgotten that in the largest towns there has been definite 
decline of infant mortality in the last twenty-five years. To what is that 
due ? It may be due to extension of boundaries which have absorbed 
healthy suburbs (in 1905 the infant mortality rate of Manchester was 159, 
but excluding the newly amalgamated districts it was 164), or it may be 
due to sanitary improvement, either in the direction of housing, or the 
abolition of privy-middens, or merely of an immense advance in general 
sanitation. The decreasing birth rate in these towns must also not be 
forgotten.

however, impossible. The figures are not available, and 
there is the further difficulty that did they exist they 
would be largely unreliable because the boundaries of the 
urban and rural districts vary, from time to time, being 
extended or reduced, or even whole districts absorbed. 
Hence comparable statistics for a period longer than one 
year are unobtainable. I am able, however, to supply two 
instances of such local differentiation of infant mortalities 
within counties, one a fairly typical urban and rural 
county, Bedfordshire, the other wholly an urban county, 
the administrative county of London, and we may briefly 
examine these. 1 

The county of Bedford has an acreage of 303,500. 
There are thirteen local government districts, seven urban 
and six rural. The population in 1901 was 172,569, of 
whom 95,248 lived in urban districts and 77,321 in rural. 
The latter districts are declining in population. The 
infant mortality in 1845-54 for the whole county was 159 
per 1,000 births; in 1871-80 it had declined to 147, and 
in the latest decennium (1891-1900) it had further fallen 
to 126, and 106 in 1901-05. This shows a steady and 

1 For the reasons stated above it is only possible to quote returns for 
London since the formation of the boroughs in 1900. Taking the last five 
years, 1901-05, the average infant mortality for London is 138. The return 
for each borough is as follows : 

Paddington, 129 Stoke Newington, 117 Bermondsey, 161 

Kensington, 150 Hackney, 129 Lambeth, 129 

Hammersmith, "148 Holborn, 109 Battersea, 140 

Fulham, 145 Finsbury, 139 Wandsworth, 122 

Chelsea, 139 City of London, 138 Camberwell, 134 

Westminster, 127 Shoreditch, 179 Deptford, 137 

Marylebone, 99 Bethnal Green, 151 Greenwich, 131 

Hampstead, 97 Stepney, 149 Lewisham, 112 

St. Pancras, 144 Poplar, 156 Woolwich, 120 

Islington, 131 Southwark, 161 

It will be seen at once, as we shall mention subsequently, that the central 
districts are characterised by a higher infant death rate than the outside 
areas. The more urban the district of the county the higher the death 
rate of children. But this is not due to mere density, but to social and 
industrial iconditions and to domestic insanitation.

marked improvement to which we shall again refer. The 
infant mortality rates for each of the thirteen districts for 
the last five years, which owing to adjustment of boundaries 
are the only figures available, were as follows :

The density of population per acre has also been added 
for comparative purposes, and we at once see how a 
decennial return of infant mortality such as 106 per 
1,000 births becomes distributed. The urban districts 
(population density 6-9) are approximately (for the quin- 
quenniad) 112, and the rural districts (population density 
0*28) 92. So far the distribution of rate appears to be 
following density of population. But wnen we come to 
examine each district we find that infant mortality bears 
no relation to density of population. In the middle of the 
county is a large rural district, that of Ampthill, with some 
three acres of land to each person, and an infant mortality 
rate of 91 ; whilst the little town of Ampthill, with one 
acre to each person, has a mortality of 79. Bedford, the 
county town, has 15 persons to the acre and an infant 
mortality rate of 119, but Luton, a town of almost exactly 



34 INFANT MORTALITY 

the same size with many physical advantages over Bed- 
ford, and having only n persons to the acre, has an 
infant mortality of 130 per 1,000, by far the highest in 
the county. The Biggleswade rural district, too, does not 
behave itself as might be expected. There also there are, 
roughly, three acres to each person, as in the neighbouring 
district of Ampthill, but the infant mortality is 1 1 1, 20 per 
1,000 above Ampthill, and precisely the same figure as 
Leighton Buzzard with its three people to each acre. 

The fact is, when we come to examine the matter of 
persons per acre, density per se has very little to do with 
the causation of infant mortality, as Dr. Newsholme 
pointed out in 1891 when he showed that in good-class 
model dwellings, though the density of persons per acre 
was high, the infant mortality rate was low. 1 The relation 
indeed obtaining between density per acre and infant 
mortality is little more than a preliminary guidance to 
the investigator to direct his attention to the towns. Let 
us look at the microcosm of the problem as observable 
in Bedfordshire. A glance at the chart will show five 
towns, in their order of infant mortality, as follows : 
Luton (130), Bedford (119), Biggleswade (119), Dunstable 
(116), and Leighton Buzzard (in). Bedford and Luton 
are approximately of equal population and much larger 
places than the other towns named. The infant mortality 
rate for Luton was 175 per 1,000 for 1881-90, in the next 
decenniad it fell to 158. It is now approximately 130 
(1901-05). The infant death rate for Bedford has been 
low for many years. What is the difference between the 
two towns in relation to this question ? It is threefold. 

1. A difference of age incidence of population. 

2. A difference of social life and poverty. 

3. A difference of occupation.

DISTRIBUTION OF INFANT MORTALITY 35 

Bedford is a centre of school education, and has an 
exceptionally large population of young people, and 
therefore a very low birth rate. There is a more leisured 
social life, and a small degree of "primary" poverty. 
Lastly, it is not an industrial or manufacturing town. 
Luton, on the other hand, though a town of equal size, 
is composed of a less selected population as regards age 
incidence. There is a good deal of poverty, some of 
which is "primary," and, generally speaking, the town 
is a manufacturing one, with all that such a condition 
involves. 

We shall discover subsequently how intimately these 
social conditions are connected with infant mortality, but we 
have already found that the distribution of this particular 
death rate in England and Scotland leads us to believe 
that there may be, broadly, a line of cleavage between 
urban and rural conditions, a study of which may throw 
some light on to the causes 'of infant mortality. Before 
discussing the point we shall do well to widen our ground, 
and thereby make the more certain of it. We may take 
Wiltshire. In 1845-54 the infant mortality rate of Wilt-

shire was 128. In 1871-80 it had fallen to no, and in the 
last decennial period to 102. It is a county without any 
large towns, and may be suitably contrasted with England 
and Wales and with the large towns. The result is shown 
in the table on the previous page. 

This forms a proud record, and it is but a part of a 
similar record running back over many years. The whole 
county of Wiltshire is characterised by a lower infant 
mortality rate even than rural England, but it will 
be noticed that whilst the rural infant death rate in 
Wiltshire is always low, it is not always below the 
urban ; yet it is always below the rates for England 
and Wales. The order of sequence from the worst 
districts to the best in regard of infant mortality is : Large 
Towns, Large Towns and Rural Districts, Rural Districts. 1 
It is ever the same as we travel outwards from the centres 
of our largest towns. In the centre the high rates, on 
the circumference the middle rates, in the rural dis- 
trict outside the lowest rates. If the metropolitan 
boroughs in the heart of London be compared with 
those on the circumference, however rapid their growth, 2

If instead of the metropolitan boroughs, some of which 
though forming the boundary of London in one part con- 
tribute to its centre in another,' the really suburban districts 
be taken the difference between the averages would be 
greater still. 1 Or if we take Manchester we obtain a similar 
result. In Manchester township, the central districts of the 
city, the infant mortality rate in 1904 was 208 for legitimate 
infants 196, for illegitimate children 445 per 1,000 births. 
But in North Manchester the figures fell respectively to 



inter-census period of 1891-1901 were as follows : East Ham increased by 
193 per cent. (32,712 in 1891 to 96,018 in 1901). The infant mortality in 1905 
was 125. Walthamstow increased by 105 per cent, (infant mortality rate 
1905, 106). Willesden increased by 87 per cent, (infant mortality rate 
1905, 112). Hornscy increased 61 per cent, (infant mortality rate 1905, 66). 
Ley ton increased 56 per cent, (infant mortality rate 1905, 94). Nor are the 
London outgrowths alone. Two very opposite suburbs of Birmingham 
may be cited as typical. King's Norton increased from 28,300 in 1891 to 
57,122 in 1901, an increase of 101 per cent. The infant mortality for 1905 
was 89. Smethwick increased by 56 per cent., and even its infant mortality 
rate is only 137 for 1905. 

1 Taking the infant mortality rate for 1905 in Croydon, Willesden, 
Hornsey, Tottenham, West Ham, East Ham, Leyton, and Walthamstow 
eight districts actually on the circumference of London and comprising a 
total population of 1,135,316, we get an average infant mortality rate of 108 
per 1,000 births. 



38 INFANT MORTALITY 

1 66, 159, and 408, and in the country districts north of 
Manchester the infant mortality was 124 per 1,000 births. 
All these facts and figures point to one conclusion, 
namely, that there is a relation existing between con- 
ditions arising out of urban life which are unfavourable 
to the life of infancy, and there are conditions existing 
in rural districts which are on the whole favourable to 
infancy. 

We must therefore examine more closely into the facts 
relating to urban and rural counties. Fortunately this 
has been made possible by the returns provided by the 
Registrar-General, and in particular in his report for 1891. 
In that year the infant mortality rate for England and 
Wales was 149, which was higher than the average of 
the decennial period immediately preceding. The rates, 
however, for the several counties followed the ordinary 
distribution, "the general rule being," as the Registrar- 
General expresses it, " that the rate is lowest in the purely 
agricultural and highest in the mining counties and those 
with textile industries." Particularly is it high in the 
towns in the latter, of which Preston, Blackburn, and 
Leicester are fairly typical. In order to compare infant 
mortalities of urban and rural districts the Registrar- 
General selected the two extremes, namely, three agri- 
cultural counties, in which, as we have seen, the mortality 
of infants is low, and the three towns above named. For 
comparative purposes five mining and manufacturing 
counties were selected as lying between the two, being 
neither purely industrial and yet containing a considerable 
intermixture of rural elements. These five districts were 
Staffordshire, Leicestershire, Lancashire, the West Riding 
of Yorkshire, and Durham. 

The infantile deaths in these three groups of districts in 
1889-91 were as follows :

From this table it is evident that in the three years 
under consideration that of 100,000 infants born in the 
agricultural counties 5,180 had died within the first three 
months, in the mining districts 7,949 had died, and in the 
three selected towns 9,126 had died. These differences 
are sufficiently distinct to emphasise the fact that infant 
life survives in much greater measure in agricultural 
districts. But for reasons which will appear subsequently 
the first three months of life are likely to witness less 
change in incidence of death in such groups as these 
three than later months in the first year of life. And 
this becomes evident when we observe that at the end of 
the first twelve months there have died in the rural 
counties, in round numbers, 10,000 infants, in the manu- 
facturing counties 17,000, and in the manufacturing towns 
22,000, or more than double the total of the agricultural 
districts. The annual death rates tell the same story. 

That further light might be thrown upon the interesting 
record revealed in this table, the Registrar-General fur- 
nished full particulars with regard to the actual cause of 
death and the exact period in the first year at which death 



40 INFANT MORTALITY 

took place in the case of the infants dying in the agricul- 
tural counties and in the three selected towns. The broad 
facts which they teach may be mentioned here. Taking 
the three rural counties and the three selected towns the 
following features are common to both groups : 

(a) The infant mortality is highest in the first day of 
life in both groups. Out of 100,000 infants born 
1,002 died on the first day in the counties and 
1,198 in the towns. 

(b) The mortality, though remaining high, then declines 

through the remaining days of the first week, falling 
from 296 on the second day to 80 on the seventh 
in the counties and from 485 to 109 in the towns. 

(c) The mortality is at its maximum in the first week, 

falls enormously in the second week, remains at 
much the same level through the third week, and 
falls again in the fourth. In the towns the mor- 
tality rose in the third week. 

(d} Passing from weeks to months the mortality falls 
enormously in the second month, by 2,493 deaths in 
the counties and 2,817 in the towns. Then it 
continues very slowly to fall during the remainder 
of the year, showing, both in the three counties 
and the three towns, the least fall between the 
seventh and eighth months. 

So much for . the characteristics which are common to 
both the agricultural group and the town group. In both 
the mortality is so high in the first week that were it main- 
tained without diminution every infant of 100,000 would 
die without nearly completing one year of existence. 
These common features, presented alike by low infant 
mortality of rural counties and the high infant mortality 
of certain towns, must, as the Registrar-General points 
out, be accepted as distinguishing infant mortality 
generally.

The differences must now be named. 

(a) The aggregate mortality in the three towns is twice 
as high as it is in the three counties. There are, in fact, 
21,803 deaths in the towns as compared with 9,717 in the 
counties. 

(U} The town rate is throughout the twelve months higher 
than the rural rate except on the fifth day of the first week. 

(c] The town rates are most in excess of the rural rates in 
the later months of the year. In the first week of life the 
town rate exceeds the rural by 23 per cent., in the second 
by 64, in the third by 83, and in the fourth by 97, showing 
a progressive increase in the deleterious effects of town 
conditions on infant life. And the same is true of the 
months ; until in the sixth month it amounts to no less 
than 273 per cent. The conditions of Preston, Leicester, 
and Blackburn therefore destroyed infants in 1889, 1890, 
and 1891 throughout the first year of life, but more so in 
the later weeks of the year tnan in the earlier, and they 
were especially destructive after the second month. 

When we turn to the table of causes some explanation of 
these remarkable rates is obtainable. First, in both groups 
premature birth, congenital defects, atrophy, and immaturity 
have their maximum in the first weeks, causing more than 
four-fifths of all the deaths in the first month. Secondly, 
the next wave of disease begins about the second month, 
and consists of respiratory diseases and diarrhoea ; the 
former runs through the rest of the year, the latter reaches 
its zenith about the third and fourth months, after which 
it slowly declines (see Chart). Thirdly, infectious dis- 
eases, such as whooping-cough and measles begin, the 
former in the second month and the latter somewhat later, 
reaping their harvest of death later in the year. 

The chief causes of death in the counties are, in order, 
immaturity, respiratory diseases, and nervous diseases, 
including convulsions ; in the towns the chief causes are 



42 INFANT MORTALITY 

immaturity, diarrhoea, nervous diseases, including convul- 
sions, and respiratory diseases. Infectious diseases, " over- 
laying," and syphilis are more frequent as causes of death 
in the towns than in the counties. Thus the salient 
features may be expressed in two sentences 

All diseases of infancy are heavier in the towns than 
the counties ; but immaturity is twice as fatal 
and epidemic diarrhcea seven times as fatal in the 
towns. 

In conclusion, then, it may be said that the distribution 
of infant mortality in Great Britain follows mainly in the 
wake of urbanisation that is, high density of population 
in towns combined with industrial and social conditions. 
It becomes in its most acute form a problem of town life. 
Rural life, as found in agricultural counties, appears to be 
favourable to infancy, probably owing to social conditions 
and domestic habits. But in those counties which are 
largely composed of towns, or in the towns themselves, 
the infant mortality is in excess of that of rural districts, 
particularly in the later months of the first year. Immaturity 
exacts its toll of deaths in both urban and rural com- 
munities, though most heavily in the towns. Epidemic 
diarrhoea, on the other hand, is in the main an urban 
disease. It is now necessary, therefore, to consider the 
diseases which chiefly bring about high infant mortality. 



Ill 

THE FATAL DISEASES OF INFANCY 

" T N no year, from the extinction of the plague (in 1679) 
J. until the last decennium of the eighteenth century, 
do the bills of the parish clerks show an excess of baptisms 
over burials, and in most years they show a greater short- 
coming of births than the somewhat negligent registration 
of baptisms could account for. On the other hand, there 
were many years of the earlier period, in the intervals 
between the greater explosions of plague, when the 
baptisms exceeded the burials by various fractions up to 
25 per cent. But whereas in the plague period the high 
mortalities were largely of adults, there is reason to think 
that afterwards they fell more upon the age of infancy." 1 
The sacrifice of infant life in London from the Restora- 
tion until late in the eighteenth century was enormous, the 
deaths under the age of two amounting in some years to 
two-fifths of the deaths at all ages, and to more than half 
the births. One great cause, in Dr. Creighton's opinion, of 
this high mortality among infants was the same Summer 
Diarrhoea that cuts off so many infants in the manufactur- 
ing and industrial towns at the present time. " In each of 
the three successive hot summers and autumns in London, 
1669-71, that malady added some 2,000 to the bill [of 
mortality] for the year in the course of some eight or ten

weeks. An epidemic of measles in 1674, the first severe 
one that is recorded, brought up the deaths by its direct 
and indirect effects to a much higher average for the first 
six months of the year than a severe epidemic of smallpox 
did in the last six. In certain unhealthy seasons, such as 
those of 1669-71, 1678-80, 1685-86, and 1688-89, there 
were many market towns and country parishes whose 
registers showed an excess of burials over christenings, the 
special occasional causes having been widely prevailing 
fevers, epidemic agues, with influenzas and smallpox." 1 

London, in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, was 
even more urban than it is now, and within its walls there 
was more overcrowding of the houses as they then existed, 
and less ventilation and light. Of sanitation and preven- 
tion, as we understand the terms, there was none. Little 
wonder that epidemic disease wrought havoc, and that 
every summer brought, with a regularity and certainty 
that impressed the mind of Sydenham, the very malady 
which even yet kills in such large numbers the infants 
of towns. Nor can there be much doubt but that the 
Fire of London was one of the greatest sanitary events 
of the seventeenth century. And yet after the rebuild- 
ing of London many of the old diseases returned, though 
probably in less prevalent degree. Though Summer 
Diarrhoea is periodically still with us in epidemic form, 
some changes have occurred. Measles is probably less 
fatal, and smallpox, compared with its ravages before the 
time of Jenner, has almost vanished. Epidemic ague has 
likewise been driven out. What, then, has been left that 
our infant mortality rate remains high? 

The diseases from which infants die are various. But 
for obvious reasons they are less diverse than those causing 
death in adults. The influences surrounding the life of an 
infant are less numerous and on the whole less complex. 

1 Dr. Charles Creighton in Traill's Social England (1903), vol. iv. p. 646.

Its environment is not only smaller in compass and sphere 
but more uniform throughout than that of the adult. It is 
less exposed to weather, to cold, to a changing diet, to the 
dangers and exigencies of occupation, and so forth. On 
this account it is possible to delimit the main causes of 
death in infancy with some exactitude. 

In the Appendix will be found two tables 1 in which are 
classified the chief causes of death among male and female 
infants in England and Wales, and in London in 1903, the 
latest year for which statistics are available. 2 For England 
and Wales the diseases causing most infant deaths are 
charted on the attached diagram. The total number of 
deaths of children under twelve months of age in England

It will be seen that Prematurity and Atrophy together 
constitute more than 30 per cent, of the total deaths. 
The death rate from these diseases is, as a rule, approxi- 
mately the same in London and in large towns, namely, 
45 per 1,000, as compared with 42 in the country districts. 
Dr. Farr used to say that 7 per cent, of all births were 
premature. In Finsbury during the last five years the

It will be noted that atrophy and debility are grouped 
with prematurity as belonging really to the same genus of 
diseases, which with congenital defects form a large group 
of conditions having, in many cases, an ante-natal origin. 
These children are simply born in such poor physical 
condition that they are unfit to live, and find a few hours 
or days of extra-uterine life too much for them. They 
are not so much diseased as merely unfit, and either not 
ready or not equipped for a separate existence. In Man- 
chester in 1891 wasting diseases and prematurity caused 
20*5 per cent, of the total infant deaths ; in 1905 these 
conditions caused 29-6 per cent. 

1 These include premature birth, atrophy, marasmus, debility, inani- 
tion, &c. 

3 The mean temperature of third quarter in 1901 was 61-9 as against 
mean of 59 for 15 years. The rainfall was 6-5 in. as against 9-4 mean 
for 15 years. 

3 The mean temperature of the third quarter in 1902 was 57-6 as 
against 59-0. The rainfall was 5*9 in. 

4 Mean temperature of third quarter 57-8 as against mean of 59. The 
rainfall was 12-3 in. 



48 INFANT MORTALITY 

Epidemic Diarrhoea is, as we shall see in a later chapter, 
a specific and fairly definite disease. It is the most 
destructive of all diseases attacking children under the 
age of five years. Diarrhceal diseases are ordinarily very 
much more fatal in urban districts than rural, are more 
dangerous to boys than to girls, and cause the greatest 
havoc among children in the first year of life, bringing 
about on an average one-fifth of the total mortality of 
infants. In the table on p. 46 it will be seen that the 
disease was responsible in 1903 for 13-9 per cent, of the 
infant deaths in England and Wales. This figure only 
concerns zymotic diarrhoea and does not include gastric 
catarrh or gastritis. All these diseases, as we shall subse- 
quently see, are aggravated by bad housing conditions, 
poverty, artificial feeding, and domestic insanitation. It 
has been shown that in poor homes diarrhoea alone may 
cause an infant mortality rate of 30 or 40 per 1,000 births, 
whereas under better circumstances it may contribute only 
10 or 12 per 1,000 to the infant mortality rate. 

Convulsions is a word designating a symptom rather 
than a disease. But it has come to be used, unfortunately, 
as synonymous with disease. The condition may be 
idiopathic and allied to epilepsy. Possibly 10 per cent, 
of the cases of epilepsy begin specifically as convulsions. 
More commonly the condition is symptomatic of other 
disease, (i) It may be the indication of brain disease, 
such as meningitis or intracranial tumour, or even a fall on 
the head ; (2) it may be of the nature of a rigor and indi- 
cate the onset of an acute fever, such as scarlet fever or 
pneumonia ; (3) reflex irritation may cause it due to 
unwise diet, or colic, or teething, or the presence of 
parasitic worms in the intestine ; (4) lastly, convulsions 
may be caused by toxic conditions of the blood, such as 
uraemia and some cases of epidemic diarrhoea. These four 
conditions do not exhaust the etiology of this symptom, 



THE FATAL DISEASES OF INFANCY 49 

which is always aggravated, if not in part caused, by 
constitutional disease such as rickets and possibly 
syphilis. But be it caused how it may, " convulsions " 
kills upwards of 13,000 infants in England and Wales 
every year, and proves to be most fatal in the first weeks 
of life. 

Pneumonia is a disease which affects all classes and at 
all ages. It is not in any special sense a disease of infancy, 
and yet more than 10,000 infants succumb to it annually, 
and another 10,000 to bronchitis in England and Wales 
alone. The urban rates are usually some 80 per cent, in 
excess of the rural, and males suffer more than females. 
It is in childhood and old age that pneumonia is most 
destructive to life. No doubt it is caused in part by 
careless exposure of infants to cold. Infancy is a time of 
very fine physical susceptibility, and in no respect more so 
than in bodily temperature. 

One further preliminary matter remains to be con- 
sidered, namely, the distribution of the chief fatal diseases 
of infancy as regards urban and rural districts in England. 
The returns for the latest available quinquenniad are set 
out on the next page. 

From these figures will be seen the influence of urban 
life upon infant death rates distributed as to disease. 
Each of the chief diseases is more fatal in urban counties 
than in rural, but particularly is this so in diarrhceal 
diseases. In Dundee, a typically urban district with all 
its evils, the three common causes of infant mortality are 
immaturity, respiratory diseases, and gastric conditions. 
The first is probably due to pre-natal influences, the 
second to exposure, and the third is " associated with 
the predominance of married women's labour." 1 

In passing it may be noted that in France the chief 

1 Dundee Social Union Report on Housing and Industrial Conditions in 
Dundee, 1905, pp. 68, 69. 



50 



INFANT MORTALITY 



cause of infant mortality appears to be epidemic diarrhoea. 
Balaestra and Gilletta have shown that of a thousand 
dead infants 385 succumbed to diarrhoea, 177 to con- 
genital defects, 147 to pulmonary affections, and 50 to 
contagious diseases. In the urban districts of Pas-de- 
Calais it was found that even a higher proportion of 
infants died from diarrhcea. 1

An examination of these various returns seems at first 
sight a formidable task. Yet if we take a broad view of 
the matter we shall find that there are at the present time 

1 Revue d'Hygiene et de Medicine Infantiles, 1902 (Budin), pp. 398-9. 



THE FATAL DISEASES OF INFANCY 51 

five main pathological conditions, to which we can reduce 
these tables, which prove more fatal than any other 
diseases within the first twelve months of life. These 
five conditions are as follows : 

1. Epidemic diarrhoea. 

2. Respiratory disease (including bronchitis and pneu- 
monia). 

3. Prematurity and congenital defects. 

4. Atrophy and debility. 

5. Meningitis and convulsions. 

After these five diseases there is a long gap in fatality 
until we come to tuberculous diseases, whooping-cough, 
measles, and diseases of the stomach and liver. The 
above-named diseases have been stated in order of 
occurrence in male and female infants and for urban 
communities. For rural districts there would be some 
alteration in order of importance, but not otherwise. For 
example, in rural districts prematurity and congenital 
defects would stand first, and would be followed by 
atrophy, which in its turn would be closely followed by 
the other three conditions named. But the five conditions 
would remain as by far the greatest contributors to the 
death of infants. Moreover, if we go back a quarter of a 
century and examine the bills of mortality of that period 
we shall find precisely these same five diseases playing 
havoc with infant life. But the chief of the five will be 
general conditions, such as atrophy and bronchitis, and 
prematurity and diarrhoea will be at the bottom of the 
list. In addition to the decline which has taken place 
in bronchitis, in atrophy, debility and inanition, and 
in meningitis and convulsions, there has also been a 
marked decline in some of those diseases which make a 
smaller contribution to the fatality of infants, such as 
tuberculosis, syphilis, smallpox, and other infective 
diseases.

South Wales (less Glamorgan), Suffolk, Westmoreland, Wilts. Estimated 
urban population (1902), 4,279,175. 

There has been, then, a heavy decline in some of the 
infant diseases which were most fatal twenty-five years 
ago, and yet the total infant mortality has not declined. 
It therefore seems probable that some fatal conditions 
have increased. Now, when we examine the accom- 
panying table, modified from Dr. Tatham 1 we shall find 

1 Report of Interdepartmental Committee on Physical Deterioration, 
vol. i. p. 132. 



THE FATAL DISEASES OF INFANCY 53 

that the causes which have contributed to maintain the 
total infant mortality at about its former level appear to 
have been epidemic diarrhoea, pneumonia, and prematurity, 
including congenital defects. 

" The increase of pneumonia mortality," writes Dr. 
Tatham, " is coincident with an increased fatality of that 
disease in the general population, and although this 
increase between the two quinquennia [1873-77 and 
1898-1902] is proportionally large, it counts but little 
against the decrease from the other causes just mentioned. 
With diarrhceal diseases and with premature birth and 
congenital defects the case is far different, the in- 
creased mortality from these causes being very marked. 
Taking together diarrhceal diseases and diseases of the 
stomach and liver, the recent five years show an increase 
of more than 70 per cent, in the urban and of nearly 
70 per cent, in the rural counties. From premature birth 
and congenital defects the increase, though numerically 
smaller, was proportionally even greater than that from 
diarrhceal diseases. Among males in the urban counties 
the rate had increased by 70 per cent., and among females 
by 64 per cent., while in the rural counties it had increased 
by 74 per cent, in each sex." Dr. Tatham states that " the 
increased mortality from diarrhceal diseases is probably 
attributable in great part to the prevalence of artificial 
infant feeding, and this view appears to be consistent with 
the fact that the increase has been greater in the urban 
than in the rural counties." 1 

It should be added that Whooping-cough showed a 
decrease of more than 10 per cent, in the urban counties 
but an increase of nearly the same amount in the rural 
counties, while Measles showed an increased fatality 
among children of each sex and in both groups of counties.

Much the same broad conclusions must be arrived at 
if we take England and Wales as a whole instead of 
selected areas. The following table sets out the annual 
death rates at all ages in England and Wales from 
measles, whooping-cough, diarrhoea, and prematurity 
from 1866 to the last decennium. 1

These figures, of course, have the disadvantage for the 
present purpose of dealing with deaths at all ages, but 
with the exception of diarrhoea the diseases are almost 
wholly of children only. The result is fairly clear measles 
has declined less than whooping-cough ; diarrhoea, if 
cholera be deducted, is steadily increasing ; and fatality 
from prematurity and congenital defects have increased 
by 40 per cent, since 1866-70. The returns for London 
since 1851-60 show almost precisely the same changes, 
except that whooping-cough shows a more marked decline. 
But it is important to follow the changes of diarrhoea, pre-

maturity, and respiratory diseases in London with more 
precision. For this purpose the following table has been 
drawn up from the Registrar-General's reports in the two 
periods quoted :

Here we have returns for infants only, covering a period 
of about sixty years. The changes which have occurred 
in the relative importance of death from these three causes 
are emphatic. Diarrhoea, which formerly caused the death 
of only 10 per cent, of dead infants, has increased in half a 
century to 1 5 per cent. ; respiratory diseases have risen 
from 1 6 to 18 per cent. ; and prematurity from 17 to 29 
per cent 1 These figures may be accepted as representa- 
tive of the changes which have been proceeding with all 
the more confidence in that the returns which Dr. Tatham 
furnished 2 for urban counties, 1873-77 compared with 
1898-1902, occupy an intermediate position in percentage 
on total infant deaths between the returns in the above 
table for 1845-49 and 1899-1903. The changes here 
represented, then, had been going on more or less 
through the whole period, and, allowing for variations

was more than double the number per 1,000 births in 1873.

56 INFANT MORTALITY 

in nomenclature and improved medical diagnosis, the 
percentage increase is so marked that it cannot be 
doubted. 

Nor is England alone, for the changes which have been 
taking place here, an old country, during the last half 
century, have begun to take place in the Australian 
Colonies, a new country, within the last ten years. In 
New South Wales there has been a decline in infant 
deaths due to certain zymotic diseases, to convulsions 
and to debility, but an increase in the number due to 
diarrhoea and prematurity. Comparing 1902 with 1893, 
diarrhoea and enteritis has undergone an increase of 30 
per cent, and prematurity an increase of 26 per cent. 1 
. These facts leave us in no doubt as to the total 
increase which has taken place in some of the chief fatal 
diseases of infancy to wit, prematurity and congenital 
conditions, epidemic diarrhoea, and respiratory diseases. 

Other children's diseases are vanishing or have van- 
ished. There has been a vast improvement in the general 
environment surrounding their lives. But the problem of 
infantile mortality still remains because of the increase 
in these diseases prematurity, pneumonia, and diarrhoea. 

We have now to consider the age incidence of these 
diseases, and some particulars as to occurrence and 
fatality. And first as to age incidence. To obtain light 
upon this point it is necessary to bear in mind the age 
incidence of death in infants, which, as we have already 
seen, falls mainly upon the first trimester of the first year 
of life, and becomes less in each succeeding quarter. The 
table on the opposite page will serve to emphasise this 
fact again (see also p. 14) : 

From these figures it is evident that whatever differences 
in circumstances and conditions obtain in these six towns, 

1 See Appendix, p. 338. Much the same change has taken place in 
other Australian States.

they all yield the same result, namely, that about 45 
per cent, of all infant deaths occur in the first trimester. 
In England and Wales the percentage is 48. If this 
first trimester were further subdivided into one-month 
periods, it would be found that the majority of deaths 
occur in the first month, next in the second, and so on 
(see p. n). Now if we take the three diseases which are 
increasingly responsible for infant mortality, we shall find 
that for these same towns the percentages are as follows :

58 INFANT MORTALITY 

It is thus apparent that prematurity is a fatal disease in 
the first trimester ; that diarrhoea is fatal mainly in the 
second trimester ; and that pneumonia and bronchitis fall 
on the last half of the year. If we further subdivided the 
deaths from diarrhoea and from prematurity, we should 
find practically no fatal diarrhoea in the first three weeks 
of life, but nearly all the premature deaths. From the 
above table, the percentages of which are taken out on 
the total infant deaths, it is clear what proportion, as a 
rule, of the infant deaths are due to each of these diseases. 
Broadly, it works out at diarrhoea 17 per cent, pneumonia 
and bronchitis 20 per cent., and prematurity 12 per cent., 
making a total of 50 per cent, in all. Prematurity would 
rise to about 30 per cent, if to it were added the deaths 
from all congenital conditions and atrophy. 

The whole position is well illustrated in the interesting 
table : drawn up by Dr. Chalmers for the distribution of 
the chief fatal diseases in infancy in Glasgow in 1904. 
This shows that 32^5 per cent, of all infant deaths are due 
to immaturity r , in which he includes all forms of pre- 
maturity, in addition to atrophy and debility (and more 
than half of the deaths included are due to these latter 
conditions). These diseases fall, of course, in the first 
trimester of the infant's life. Diseases of respiration 
cause 22-9 per cent, and are common throughout the 
twelve months. To diarrhoea is due 16*6 per cent of the 
deaths, chiefly in the second and third trimesters, and 
9'8 per cent, are due to infectious diseases, which occur 
late in the year. The death rates in each of these diseases 
is higher for male than female infants, except that in 
diseases of digestion and in infectious diseases they are 
equal. 2 

There are three points which must not be lost sight of 

1 Appendix, p. 336-337. 

* Ann. Rep. of Med. Off. of Health of Glasgow, 1904, pp. 28-29. 



THE FATAL DISEASES OF INFANCY 59 

in drawing any conclusions from these facts. First, the 
quinquennial periods selected by Dr. Tatham seem to be 
in no way exceptional. The changes manifested are such 
as have been taking place not only for a longer period 
than that of a quarter of a century, but with a somewhat 
remarkable degree of uniformity. Secondly, that in the 
main the diseases which have declined in fatal issue in 
infants have been those against which the methods of 
preventive medicine have been applied. For example, 
there has been a decline in smallpox in England and 
Wales, in which the whole population has shared, from an 
annual mortality of 576 per million persons in 1838-42 
down to 13 per million persons in 1891-1900; scarlet 
fever has also declined generally from an annual mortality 
of 971 per million persons in 1861-70 to 158 in 1891- 
1900, and is now one of the least fatal of all the infectious 
diseases ; whooping-cough is in the same case, falling 
from 530 in 1861-70 to 37$ in 1891-1900, and 285 in 
1903 ; even diphtheria, which, of course, showed a recent 
increase, has now fallen enormously in fatality ; and tuber- 
culosis is no exception to this rule of decline. What is 
true of England and Wales is also true broadly of 
London. In fact, it becomes evident that certain infantile 
diseases have responded to methods of repression such as 
vaccination, antitoxin treatment, isolation, and the general 
advance in sanitation and public hygiene which has 
occurred. But it is otherwise with certain other diseases. 
Thirdly, it must be continually borne in mind that more 
accurate medical diagnosis, and therefore more accurate 
certification of the cause of death, has been secured in 
recent years, with the obvious result that there has been a 
tendency to a transference of deaths from indefinite to 
definite causes. Debility, atrophy, convulsions, teething, 
and so forth, are general terms which naturally are less 
used as diagnosis becomes more exact. Notwithstanding 



60 INFANT MORTALITY 

this reservation, it may be taken that the changes already 
indicated are so well marked that they represent with 
approximate accuracy the changes which have actually 
taken place. 

Amid much that is obscure and some things that are 
doubtful there remain certain things of which we may be 
sure ; and if the bills of mortality quoted above and the 
tables in the Appendix (pp. 334-336), tabulating the 
returns for England and Wales and London, and also for 
Glasgow, be taken as a whole, some of these broad and 
certain facts will be found to emerge : 

First, the causes of infant mortality are composite. It 
has been well said that every effect has an ancestry 
of causes. Pre-eminently is this the case in regard 
to infant mortality, which is due to a combination of 
factors closely inter-related. 

Secondly, nearly one half (about 48 per cent.) of the infant 
deaths in towns occur in the first three months of 
life; 

Thirdly, the chief fatality in these first three months is 
caused by prematurity and immaturity ; 

Fourthly, by far the greatest fatality in the remainder of 
the first year of life is due to inflammatory conditions 
of the lungs and to epidemic diarrhoea ; and 

Lastly, infant mortality is not declining owing to the fact 
that while certain diseases have enormously decreased, 
prematurity, pneumonia, and epidemic diarrhoea have, 
in spite of all advance in science, steadily increased, 
particularly in the towns and where the lamp of social 
life burns low. 



IV 

ANTE-NATAL INFLUENCES ON INFANT MORTALITY 

WE have seen that Immaturity is one of the largest 
contributors to infant mortality, and that it is 
increasing. In many districts it is the chief cause, and in 
most large urban districts it furnishes about 30 per cent, of 
all the infant deaths. The average for Finsbury during 
the last five years (1901-5) has been 30*3, and in Glasgow 
for two years (1903-4) the average has been 32*2. Similar 
percentages will be found to obtain in Manchester, Liver- 
pool, Bristol, Brighton, and other large towns. In 
Dundee, where 57 per cent, of the female population 
are occupied, 34 per cent, of the infant deaths in 
1905 were attributed to immaturity. Even in rural 
districts this is the cause of not less than 30 per cent, 
of all infant deaths. 1 It has increased more in rural 
districts than in urban. The figures would of course vary 
from time to time, and would depend upon the diseases 
included in the term immaturity. In Glasgow, as will be 
seen in a table in the Appendix, " immaturity " is made to 
include premature birth, congenital malformations, atelec- 
tasis, atrophy, and debility, and the same classification is 
used for Finsbury, where somewhat less than half the 

1 In 1904 prematurity alone, exclusive of congenital atrophy, was the 
cause of death of 20 per cent, of all infants deaths in the rural districts of 
Worcestershire, 17 per cent, in rural Bedfordshire, and 13 per cent, in 
rural Wiltshire. 

61 



62 INFANT MORTALITY 

immaturity deaths are attributed to prematurity. On the 
whole it appears to be legitimate to include under imma- 
turity the various forms of developmental disease and the 
wasting diseases of infancy. The large number of these 
latter which occur in the early weeks of life points to an 
initial defect in vitality which makes necessary their 
inclusion under immaturity. For example, in Glasgow in 
1904, out of 350 deaths of infants due to atrophy and 
debility, 250 occurred within the first twelve weeks, and 
in Finsbury a very similar proportion. 

This striking fact then, that 30 per cent, of all infant 
deaths in this country are due to immaturity, would seem 
to require explanation. It is evident that if infants die 
within a few days or hours of birth or even if dying later, 
show unmistakable signs of being unequal to the calls of 
bare physical existence, that there must be something 
more than external conditions or food or management 
which is working to their hurt. The explanation is clearly 
to be found in ante-natal conditions. We must, therefore, 
address ourselves to the question, What are the ante- 
natal conditions which lead to immaturity, and the other 
agencies which bring about the death of infants on the 
very threshold of life ? 

To understand the death or disease of the new-born 
infant it is necessary to take into account the circumstances 
through which .the infant's organism has passed before 
birth, as well as immediately after birth when the infant 
is endeavouring to adjust itself to its new environment. 
The life before birth may be divided into three periods : 
the germinal, before conception ; the embryonic, beginning 
in the first six weeks of intra-uterine life ; and the foetal 
period, lasting from the sixth or eighth week of intra-uterine 
life to the moment of birth at or about the thirty-sixth or 
fortieth week. It is evident that the germinal period 
involves the growth and development of the germ cells 



ANTE-NATAL INFLUENCES 63 

of male and female, and this in its turn includes the 
personal health of both parents both before and after 
marriage, their ancestral stock, their hereditary characters, 
and some, if not all, of their more serious diseases. 
Amongst the last named must be included syphilis, 
alcoholism, and tuberculosis in either or both parents, and 
certain other special conditions of the generative organs 
in the mother. Into these matters we cannot enter in this 
place, though they include by no means all the factors 
which will play a part in the future offspring. There is, for 
instance, the whole question of fitness of selection in mar- 
riage ; and here, it is generally admitted, there is immense 
need for improvement. The " unfit " appear to marry 
more frequently than otherwise, and not infrequently 
both parents are " unfit." A basis of health in selection is 
too rarely adopted, and social" and financial exigencies are 
considered in practice of far greater importance. Whilst 
it may be impossible, or indeed undesirable, to arrange 
marriage purely on a basis of physical fitness, we must 
not lose from sight the fact that physical unfitness is the 
source in many cases of infantile disease in the offspring. 1 
There is also the question of marriage of consanguinity. 
These are all matters which exert an effect on the problem 
before us, though it is impossible to do more than merely 
mention them. 

The embryonic period of ante-natal life, as Ballantyne 
points out in his epoch-making work, 2 cannot be con- 
sidered as limited by certain weeks of intra-uterine life 
any more than the germinal period, but extends, is so 
to speak, projected, through the foetal even into the 
neo-natal and post-natal periods. Pathology has taught 
us that there are signs indeed of its projection into 

1 See Francis Gallon's Huxley Memorial Lecture, 1901.

M.D., F.R.C.P.E., 1902, vols. i. and ii. 



64 INFANT MORTALITY 

infant life, and even into adult life, and a comparatively 
new science, known as embryonic pathology, or tera- 
tology, has arisen, which may serve to remind us of the 
long period through which embryonic influences are 
exerting a direct effect on the individual. While that 
is so the actual formative period occupies, of course, the 
early weeks of intra-uterine life, during which the 
morphology and organogenesis of the infant is developing. 
And so the foetal period is reached, and this fills by far 
the larger portion of intra-uterine existence, throughout 
which time the condition of the mother is exerting 
influences, direct and indirect, upon the foetus. It is 
impossible to say which period of the three, germinal, 
embryonic, or foetal, most impresses the physique of the 
infant before birth. No man can measure the relative 
potentialities for health or disease which each stage brings 
to the sum total at the moment of birth. 

The adjoining chart, which has been modified from 
Ballantyne, will serve to indicate in a general way the 
main divisions of the growth of an infant from the time 
of conception, through the intra-uterine period, to the time 
of birth, and onwards to the end of infancy at the twelfth 
month of life. The neo-natal period, which has been 
placed at four weeks, is occupied in the attempt of the 
new-born infant to correspond with, or adapt itself to, its 
new external environment, a period witnessing in particular 
to the adjustment of function. The commencement of 
the exercise of the vital functions, coupled as it is with 
some modification in structure, must of necessity be a 
crucial testing time as to physical fitness, or otherwise, for 
survival. As we have seen, thousands of new-born infants 
every year fail to survive. It is that non-survival which 
creates so large a part of the infant mortality. For the 
infant may be born already diseased or malformed ; or it 
may be predisposed to disease by conditions acting upon

it during its foetal existence ; or it may be so frail, owing 
to similar conditions, as to find itself unable to cope with 
its new environment of a new diet, a new temperature, 
and a new medium of respiration ; or it may be born 
before it is fully equipped either for life or for growth and 
development. " Like pregnancy, neo-natal life is an 
epoch which has a physiology in many respects peculiar 
to itself, and which borders very closely on the patho- 
logical, tending very easily to pass over into it. Further, 
just as every woman brings with her into her pregnancy 
the results of her past pathological history, so the new- 
born infant brings with him out of his ante-natal life into 
his neo-natal existence, the effects of any morbid processes 
which may have attacked him in utero. In this way the 
pathology of pregnancy and the maladies of the new-born 
infant are both invested with peculiarities ; in the former 
there is, among other things, the pathology of pre- 
reproductive maternal life ; and in the latter there is, 
among other factors, the pathology of ante-natal, fcetal, 
and embryonic life." * 

Having this general view of the periods of ante-natal 
life clearly in mind, we must now consider the answer to 
the question before us, namely, the effect of ante-natal 
conditions upon the infant which may lead to its death, 
before or after birth. Some of these conditions, or a 
certain degree of them, will lead at once to a " dead-born " 
child, the still-birth ; others will lead to a premature birth, 
in which case the child may live for any period, from a few 
hours to many years ; and others again will, short of 
death, leave the child in such physical condition as to 
handicap it in the race of life. Keeping before us the 
problem of infant mortality, we need consider only such 
ante-natal conditions as directly concern us, and of these 
four types may be taken, namely, infections, toxcemias, 
1 Ballantyne, loc. cit., vol. i. p. 76. 



ANTE-NATAL INFLUENCES 67 

prematurity, and immaturity* In all foetal diseases, be 
it infective diseases or toxaemia, it is necessary to remem- 
ber that pathological conditions in the child or in the 
unborn foetus are broadly and generically the same, for 
foetal disease is the same as post-natal disease except that 
it is modified by the intra-uterine environment, and more 
remotely by embryonic factors. 

I. INFECTIONS. 

Of the infective diseases the briefest mention will 
suffice. Smallpox has been contracted not infrequently 
by the foetus, both when the mother was suffering from the 
disease, and when she had only been in contact with the 
disease. Cases of foetal malaria, measles, scarlet fever, 
erysipelas, influenza, whooping - cough, typhoid fever 
(possibly without intestinal ulceration), and tuberculosis 
have been recorded. Nor are these the only diseases the 
bacteria or virus of which may pass through the placenta 
from mother to foetus. The infection of anthrax has been 
thus conveyed, and possibly pneumonia, and certainly 
septic diseases. Lastly there is syphilis, of which the only 
sign in the foetus may be its death. But it may be far 
otherwise. For not only may the infant be born with the 
ordinary symptoms of " infantile syphilis," but there may 
be an indefinite variety of ills and weaknesses derived from 
the primary syphilitic infection. On the other hand, as 
in the infective diseases previously mentioned, it may 
possibly happen that no infection is conveyed to the foetus 
of syphilitic parents. It may escape as entirely as it 
escapes typhoid fever, and further it is believed that it may 
in some degree possess an immunity after birth, although 
this may be of a temporary character only. The obverse 

1 See Ballantyne, loc, cit., p. 175, for complete classification of foetal 
morbid states, 



68 INFANT MORTALITY 

is also true that, according to Colles, the apparently 
healthy mother may nurse her syphilitic child, the risk to 
her being infinitesimal but not to be absolutely excluded. 

The symptoms of Infantile Syphilis are those of 
" secondary " syphilis, a coppery-coloured shrivelled skin 
with scaling cuticle, mucous tubercles at the angle of the 
mouth, " snuffles," malformed teeth, inflammation of the 
eyes, and ear disease. These symptoms may be absent 
or represented by an extensive anaemia, and either con- 
dition may be followed by laryngitis, stomatitis, specific 
inflammation of liver and spleen, bone disease, and ulcera- 
tion of the tongue. The effects of foetal syphilis are 
various. It is a common cause of miscarriage or pre- 
mature birth, owing partly to the fact that it produces 
marked placental changes. Indeed, the still-born infants 
resulting from the disease may be 100 per cent D'Aulnay 
recorded 19 dead infants out of 19 pregnancies. Ballantyne 
gives the average results of private and hospital practice 
as 46 per cent, of the pregnancies which end disas- 
trously, with an infant mortality of 42 per cent. 
Fournier states that when infection has occurred 
before conception the mortality is 65 per cent, and 
the morbidity, or actual occurrence of the disease, 
70 ; while when infection has taken place after con- 
ception the mortality is 39, and the morbidity 72 
per cent. Or, again, if infection be derived from the 
father, Fournier holds that the mortality is 28 per cent. ; 
if from the mother, 60 per cent. ; and if from both, 85 per 
cent. Further, the period of infection and its relation 
to conception bears a direct influence upon mortality. 
The three years following infection are much more fatal 
to pregnancy than later years. Fournier states that of 90 
women infected by their husbands, and who became 
pregnant in the year following their infection, 50 aborted 
or had dead-born infants, 38 gave birth to children 



ANTE-NATAL INFLUENCES 69 

who soon died, and only 2 gave birth to children who 
survived. 1 

Syphilis appears to have been declining, since 1876, as 
a cause of death in infants and in the general population. 
From 1876-80 the deaths of infants per 1,000 births in 
England and Wales was 177, and in 1896-1900 it was 
i '2 3, having shown a fairly regular decline in the twenty 
years. A more marked decline has occurred at all ages, 
from 8-5 per million in 1876-80 to 5-8 in 1896-1900. 
But though declining, there is still abundant evidence that 
syphilis is one of the most active of all maternal infections 
in the production of congenital weakness and degeneracy 
in the offspring. It has been said that no child in a 
syphilitic family in the first or second generation escapes 
during its whole life from some effect, or is really a healthy 
individual. Sooner or later the offspring of syphilitic 
parents suffer. Numbers of. children, moreover, die in 
infancy from what is called " bronchitis," but which is in 
truth congenital syphilis of the lung. 

II. TOXAEMIAS. 

The toxaemias which exert ill effects upon ante-natal 
life are mainly metallic poisonings and alcoholism. Of 
the former the chief are lead, mercury, and phosphorus. 

Lead-poisoning is known to produce abortion in animals, 
and the passage of the lead through the placenta to the 
foetus has been demonstrated. Direct evidence of such 
transmission has not been forthcoming in the human 
subject, but the nature of the effects produced on ante- 
natal life are known by clinical observation. In 1860 
Constantin Paul published the results of a research into 
the influence of lead " intoxication " upon the new-born 
infant. He set out with the view of determining whether 

1 Ballantyne, he. cit., pp. 188-257.

INFANT MORTALITY 



lead-poisoning exerted effects at all comparable to those 
of syphilis, making his observations on workers in type 
foundries. He divided his observations into six series 
which may be briefly tabulated. It will be convenient to 
place the final results in terse form, as follows :

In the first group Paul placed 4 women definitely suffering from 
plumbism ; in the second 5 who had normal pregnancies prior to 
working in lead, but after working in lead only 2 out of 36 pregnancies 
turned out well ; in the third series was a single case who, while at work 
at the type foundry, had 5 abortions out of 5 pregnancies, but after ceasing 
work had one pregnancy yielding a living, healthy child ; in the fourth 
group were two women who ceased work and had healthy pregnancies, 
and then returned to work and had abortions ; the fifth series contained 
7 women whose husbands suffered from plumbism ; and in the last 
group were 6 women whose only sign of plumbism was the blue line on 
the gums. It will be noticed that in this last group the results of the 
lead on the pregnancies was less severe. 

Paul concluded that though lead-poisoning did not pre- 
vent pregnancy, and did not act injuriously upon fecundity 
or upon menstruation, it did act upon the infant. Of the 
36 deaths included in the table, 20 died under twelve 
months of age, 8 in the second year, 7 in the third, and I 
in the fourth. 1 

Since Paul's observations a number of similar cases of 
interrupted pregnancy have been recorded, which have 
involved not only a high infant mortality rate among lead 
workers, but have resulted in frequent imbecility, idiocy, 

1 Arch. Gen. de Med., 1860, vol. i. pp. 513-533. 



ANTE-NATAL INFLUENCES 71 

and epilepsy. Roque and Rennart furnished particulars 
of eleven families in which father or mother or both were 
affected with lead-poisoning as a result of occupation in 
pottery works, and in the groups where the mothers were 
affected 92 per cent, and 94 per cent, of all the children 
born were either dead or found to be suffering from cranial 
disease. 1 Dr. Oliver has shown the remarkable ecbolic 
effect of lead on pregnant women in this country. Mrs. H., 
aged 35, worked in a white lead factory for six years, before 
which she had four children born at full time. After going 
to the lead works she had nine miscarriages in succession 
and no living child. Mrs. K., aged 34, had four living 
children before going to the lead factory and two living 
afterwards. Then she had six miscarriages, and became 
the subject of plumbism. But she recovered and left 
the lead works. Then she had another living child. 2 
Miss Paterson and Miss Deane, two of H.M. Lady 
Inspectors of Factories, found that out of 77 married 
women reported as suffering from lead-poisoning (year 
ending March 31, 1897), 15 were childless, 8 had 21 still- 
born children, 35 had 90 miscarriages, and of these 15 had 
no child born ; out of 101 living children 40 died in 
infancy, mostly from convulsions.3 

Abortion, premature labour, and still-born infants may 
also follow as a result of mercurial poisoning in pregnant 
women, but the results are not so fatal as in lead. 

In maternal phosphorus poisoning there is evidence to 
show that certain lesions exist in the foetus somewhat 
similar to those found in the mother. 

It should also be remembered that all kinds of toxaemia, 
arising from general causes may do harm to the fcetus. 
For instance, constipation, which may apparently cause no

72 INFANT MORTALITY 

ill-effects in the non-pregnant state, may set up a toxaemia 
in pregnancy. 

Alcoholism. 

Since the work of Nicloux it may be considered to 
be proved that alcohol may pass as such from the mother 
to the foetus, and in considerable quantities. 1 He not 
only proved this fact by animal experiment, but by 
examining the foetal blood from the umbilical cord and 
placenta of infants born of women to whom alcohol had 
been given one hour before labour. Other experiments 
are confirmatory of these results, and in the region of 
clinical and social investigation the results of this fact 
have been studied by many workers. 

Dr. W. C. Sullivan has shown, in particular, the influence 
of maternal inebriety on the offspring by inquiring into 
degeneracy in the descendants of the alcoholics. 2 For 
this purpose he selected a series of chronic drunkards 
from the female population of Liverpool Prison who 
had borne children. He excluded as far as possible 
cases in which alcoholism was complicated by other 
degenerative factors, such as tubercle, syphilis, and 
neurotic constitution. In the cases comprised in the 
investigation, the special nervous localisation of the 
poison was very marked ; 31 of the women had 
suffered from one or more attacks of alcoholic delirium, 
while 24 others had had occasional visual hallucinations. 
Cases were chosen in which the alcoholism occurred prior 
to the procreative career, and the intoxicants chiefly con- 
sumed were beer, whisky, and rum. These being the 
conditions, it was found that of 120 such inebriate 
women there were born 600 children, of whom 335 (or 
5 5 -8 per cent.) died under two years of age or were 
dead-born. Sullivan compared these figures with similar

These figures tell their own story, which is no doubt in 
part a story of heredity or ante-natal injury, and in part 
a story of environment. 

It was also found that there was a progressive death 
rate in the alcoholic family, the number of dead births 
or of those who died under two years of age increasing 
as time went on. Sullivan tabulates these results thus :

" These figures illustrate very clearly the progressively 
augmenting character of the influence of the mother's 
alcoholism. From that point of view it is especially 
noteworthy that the rate of still-births shows almost as 
marked a tendency to regular increase as does the death 
rate among children born alive" (Sullivan). In 31 



74 INFANT MORTALITY 

of the women drinking habits were well established at 
least two years before the first pregnancy, and of 118 
children born of these women 74 died in infancy or 
were still-born, giving a percentage mortality of 627 
as compared with 54' I for the rest of the series. Sober 
paternity seemed to have but little influence ; indeed, 
Sullivan remarks that "as regards the vitality of the 
offspring the influence of maternal drunkenness is so 
predominant a force that the paternal factor is almost 
negligible." As illustrating the effect of drunkenness on 
conception, it may be added that in seven cases the 
condition was noted. Six of the infants died in convul- 
sions in the first months of life, and the seventh was still- 
born. These figures are small, but they suggest a causa- 
tion of high infant mortality rates of illegitimate children. 
Lastly, of the children comprised in Sullivan's series, 219 
lived beyond infancy, and of these 9 or 4-1 per cent, 
became epileptic as compared with OT per cent, of the 
whole population. It should be added that other observers 
have found 12 and even 15 per cent, of the children of 
alcoholic parents to be epileptic. Sixty per cent of all 
the deaths of the children in these series was stated to be 
by " convulsions," and 10 per cent, were due to violent 
deaths. 

Arriv6, investigating 1,648 conceptions in 402 poor, 
working-class families in Paris, found a percentage of 
11*5 per cent, of abortions, and 3*5 per cent, of premature 
births in those in which one or both parents were 
alcoholic. 

Dr. Clay Shawe, some time the chief medical officer of 
the London County Asylum at Banstead, holds that 
pregnant women who are decided alcoholics miscarry 
to a much greater extent than others, and that when 
deprived of alcohol at an early stage of the pregnancy 
(as when sent early to prison and subsequently delivered 



ANTE-NATAL INFLUENCES 75 

there) they may go through the full period of gestation. 
" We have," he says, " inebriate mothers, and either 
abortions or degenerate children. The teleological I 
relationship of the two seems to be as certain as any 
other conditions of cause and effect." T 

There is no doubt that alcohol circulating in the 
maternal blood of a pregnant woman does reach the fcetus, 
and either injure its tissues and stop the proper develop- 
ment of its cells or indeed bring about its death and a 
miscarriage. But that is in all probability not the chief 
way in which alcoholism in the mother injures the off- 
spring. There is the subsequent effect on the child. Hence 
when we think of the influence of alcoholism among women 
on infant mortality we must think of two stages : first, 
injury of the child before birth ; and secondly, injury after 
birth. The former is difficult to prove in a scientific 
sense. We can only judge of.it, as a rule, by its effects, 
which, of course, if carefully observed, furnish evidence of 
the truest scientific value, such as the statistics already 
given from the observations of Dr. W. C. Sullivan. 2 

In his evidence before the Interdepartmental Committee 

1 Report of Interdcpart. Com. on Phys. Deterioration, 1904, vol. iii. p. 68. 

2 There is now indisputable evidence of a practical and clinical kind 
that alcoholism in the parents is one of the causes of mental degeneration 
of all kinds. "In regard to the effects of alcohol upon the descendants," 
says Dr. Robert Jones, Chief Medical Officer of the London County Asylum 
at Claybury, "anything which devitalizes the parent unfavourably affects 
the offspring, and clinical experience supports this in the lowered height, 
weight, and impaired general physique of the issue of intemperate 
parents. It also records the fact that no less than 42 per cent, of all 
periodic inebriates relate a history of either drink, insanity, or epilepsy in 
their ancestors." (Rep. Interdcpart. Com. Phys. Deterioration, 1904, vol. iii. 
p. 67). Dr. Kerlin, Superintendent of the Pennsylvania Institution for 
Imbeciles, calculated that the alcoholic taint was a factor in 38 per cent, 
of his cases if the habits of grandparents be included. Dr. Shuttleworth, 
formerly medical superintendent in the Royal Albert Asylum for Idiots at 
Lancaster, puts the figure at 13*2 (out of 1,200 cases), and Dr. Beach, of 
the Darenth Schools for Imbecile Children at 19-5, but if grandparental 
histories be included 21-4 (1,180 cases). From these figures, which could 
be duplicated many times over by similar returns, it is evident that 
parental intemperance is a large factor in the degeneracy of offspring, 
both mental and physical. 



76 INFANT MORTALITY 

on Physical Deterioration in 1904, Dr. Wiglesworth, the 
Medical Superintendent of Rainhill County Asylum, said 
that " there is reason to believe also, from the great 
frequency with which a history of gross parental intem- 
perance is found in the antecedents of persons who become 
insane, that a habit of excessive drinking tends in some 
cases to a poisoning of the germ cells of the parent by 
means of the alcohol circulating in the blood, and a con- 
sequent tendency on the part of these germ cells to develop 
into an organism with an unstable or badly developed 
brain. This may probably result even if the sperm cells 
of the father are alone affected. . . . 

" It is difficult to prove a thing of that kind, but those of 
us who have seen a great many of these cases have all 
come to that conclusion, that a very large proportion 
indeed of cases of insanity have intemperate parents. I 
worked it out that a sixth part of all the cases had a 
history of alcoholic intemperance in the parents. That was 
excluding all cases in which there was any hereditary 
tendency. It was necessary to exclude those. It is my 
opinion that the sperm cells of the fathers get so injured 
by the alcohol that the union of the sperm cell and the 
germ cell will produce unstable offspring. Of course the 
mother might be healthy and counteract it and so on 
it does not necessarily follow . We know that perfectly 
healthy children are born of drunken parents, but in 
many cases it does operate. There is no question with 
regard to drunken mothers that alcohol exerts an ex- 
tremely pernicious influence on the young, and poisons 
the nerve centres when the child is in a very susceptible 
condition. . . . 

" One must go back to the question of the original con- 
stitution of the germ in these cases, that is to say, the 
hereditary influence is very important indeed. The 
different stresses of life whether it is alcohol or anything 



ANTE-NATAL INFLUENCES 77 

else which people are subjected to of course act with 
greater effect on people who have a tendency to certain 
conditions. It does not follow necessarily ; there may be 
an actual tendency as reflected in the family history. We 
know frequently there is a union between germ and 
sperm cells which produces an unstable offspring, for some 
reason we do not know. Then, again, there is this special 
cause, the actual poisoning of the germ cells. I think it 
is very important to look at the development of insanity 
from the point of view of the development from the germ. 
There is no question that amongst exciting causes alcohol 
is one of the most frequent." z 

Further evidence was given on the same point by Dr. 
Leslie Mackenzie, of the Local Government Board of 
Scotland, who said that in his belief certain unstable 
nervous systems are directly affected more than others, 
and that probably the alcoholism of the mother after and 
preceding conception might have an effect upon the 
nutrition, and possibly might poison the ovum to the 
extent of interfering with its development. But that is 
really the infection of the ovum in its environment. 2 

Finally, there is the after-effect of alcoholism among 
women on the child after birth which is observable in 
various directions. An alcoholic mother may yield a milk 
of poor quality, or one actually containing alcohol in an 
excreted form, and in this way the child may be really 
starved or may itself take alcohol. Then again, the whole 
environment with which the infant is so intimately con- 
nected becomes disarranged, unclean, irregular, and this at 
once exerts an injurious influence. The child of an alco- 
holic mother is a neglected child, and neglect in infancy 
may be a direct cause of death.

78 INFANT MORTALITY 

III. PREMATURITY. 

It is well known that in both the vegetable and animal 
kingdoms many separate organisms never arrive at an 
individual existence. Every springtime myriads of seeds 
fail to germinate, and every breeding season myriads of 
spawn perish. In the human species the same apparent 
waste of germinal cells occurs. And more than that, if we 
neglect all forms of death in the germinal and embryonic 
periods, there yet remains, before we come to still-births 
and premature deaths, a vast toll of deaths of foetal 
individuals which had not arrived at the age of viability. 
These are known as abortions? and their frequency, though 
it varies widely, is believed to be about 20 or 25 per cent, 
of all pregnancies (Guillemot and Devilliers). 2 Next in 
order come, of course, the premature births, and in 
maternity hospital practice premature births, according to 
Hahn, occur in about 16 per cent, if infants weighing less 
than 2,500 grms. be regarded as prematurely born, and 
41 per cent, if the standard weight of prematurity be 
3,000 grms. For practical purposes Ballantyne puts the 
figure at 20 per cent, in maternity hospitals. It must not, 
of course, be supposed that premature birth necessarily 
means foetal death, or, indeed, death at or immediately 
following the event of birth. A certain number survive 
and even grow up to adult life, and owing to improved 
obstetric practice and a steadily improving environment 
this number is, of course, increasing. 

1 The following somewhat mechanical definitions of terms may be 
convenient : 

Abortion. Expulsion of ovum before end of fourth month of utero- 
gestation. 

Miscarriage. Expulsion from end of fourth to end of sixth month. 

Premature Birth. End of sixth month to end of pregnancy. 

But on the whole it is better to consider births as " abortions " if under 
a viable age, and if over that age as " prematurity." All these hard and 
fast terms, however, have considerable disadvantage, and can only be used 
as general indications. 

* Traitedc I'artdes Accouchements, 1886, Tarnier and Budin, vol. ii. p. 474. 



ANTE-NATAL INFLUENCES 79 

The causes of abortion and premature birth are various. 
They may be foetal or maternal in origin. The former 
may be summed up in anything which produces the death 
of the foetus, the latter in anything which attacks the 
placenta, and probably this is a much more frequent cause 
of interrupted pregnancy in an early stage than any con- 
dition of the foetus itself, which would operate more largely 
in the case of premature labour. It is not proposed to enter 
at length upon a discussion as to the etiology of these con- 
ditions of interrupted pregnancy, with which many text- 
books on obstetrics deal adequately. Our only concern 
here is to obtain a simple and clear view of the fact that 
the causes of premature birth and of abortion are broadly 
the same and are very numerous. Tarnier and Budin divide 
them into those which are general and those which are 
local, or those which belong directly to the physical con- 
dition of the parents during the pregnancy and those 
belonging to an anterior stage which may be designated 
germinal. For purposes of summary it will be sufficient 
to classify the main causes in three groups, as they concern 
respectively local disturbances of the organs concerned in 
pregnancy, infective diseases and toxaemias, and general 
conditions. 

I. It is obvious that the present volume is not the place 
to discuss in detail the causes under the first head. They 
concern broadly pathological states of the reproductive 
organs of a woman during pregnancy, such, for instance, as 
disease of the lining membrane of the uterus, irritability of 
the genital canal, which in some cases seems to be the 
result of diathesis leading to a tendency to abort, displace- 
ments and retroversions of the uterus, a low insertion of 
the placenta, mechanical injury, &c. It is clear that 
these are matters of importance, though not directly 
concerned with the practical problem of infant mortality, 
for the reason that they are conditions which may be 



80 INFANT MORTALITY 

common to pregnancy and lie in some measure outside 
control. 

2. Infections and toxaemias form, as we have seen, a very 
different group of causes of premature birth. They include 
not only the ordinary infectious diseases, but also tuber- 
culosis, syphilis, alcoholism, "ptomaine poisoning," and 
metallic poisonings. 1 We have seen how frequently these 
diseases may lead to interrupted pregnancy by their patho- 
logical process or by causing the death of the foetus. 
Some of these diseases, e.g., syphilis, undoubtedly act 
injuriously in successive pregnancies. 

3. Under the general state must be included a number 
of conditions which arise more or less directly from the 
environment of the pregnant woman or her general habits. 
Tarnier and Budin state that " Une hygiene tres defec- 
tueuse, un travail excessif ont eVidemment une action plus 
marquee ; il en est de meme de la constipation opinatre, 
de 1'accumulation de matieres fecales dans le rectum. 
L'alimentation insuffisante, dans les cas de disette, peut 
etre la cause d'avortements si nombreux, qu'il semble en 
exister une veritable epidemie." 2 

And to these must be added profound emotion, fright, 
anxiety, and sudden shock, and such conditions as living in 
over-heated and ill-ventilated rooms, the activities and 
pleasures of society, and physical causes such as a blow, a 
fall, or accidents and strains. Physical fatigue, particularly 
if accompanied by strain and stress, are likely to exert a 
decided effect in the production of premature birth, par- 
ticularly if these conditions are accompanied by long hours 
of work and poor or insufficient nourishment. It cannot 
be too clearly understood that a pregnant woman requires 
not only additional nourishment but all the physical

ANTE-NATAL INFLUENCES 81 

advantage of a hygienic life. If these conditions are not 
obtained and a pregnant woman works at industrial occu- 
pations throughout her pregnancy and in point of time 
close up to the date of labour, the result to herself and her 
offspring must inevitably be injurious. During the last 
two months of pregnancy no woman should undergo 
laborious physical toil, for it is a most important time in 
the development of the foetus, which gains weight in 
that period from 3! to 7^ Ibs. Pinard has shown the 
variation in weight due to such employment throughout 
pregnancy by weighing 500 children in each of the 
following classes with the following results : (a} 500 
infants of women working right up to the commence- 
ment of labour, 3,000 grams ; (b} 500 infants of women 
who spent the last few months of pregnancy in a 
lying-in hospital, 3,290 grams ; and (c) 500 infants of 
women who spent the whole pregnancy in hospital, 3,368 
grams. 

Before leaving this subject it is necessary to mention 
the somewhat delicate matter of artifical abortion and its 
alleged increase. In the case of Rex v. Wm. Brown and 
others tried in the Queen's Bench in 1899, evidence was 
furnished of the prevalence of this habit in England. It 
was shown that even poor women were willing to pay 
from 153. to 403. for certain widely advertised drugs for 
the procurement of abortion. One proprietor trading in 
these drugs was sufficiently confident of lucrative returns 
to expend 2,800 on advertising alone. In the same 
year medical experience confirmed the "extremely 
common " use of certain forms of lead (particularly 
diachylon} as abortifacients, to which Dr. Pope, of 
Leicester, had drawn attention in 1893.* ^ n tne follow- 
ing year (1900), Dr. Ransom, of Nottingham, described 
some of the ill-effects of lead-poisoning brought about 

1 Brit. Med. Jour. (July), 1893. 
G

by the use of this drug, which he declared to be "an 
uncertain abortifacient " which " always endangers and 
often destroys life, or leaves permanent bodily and mental 
enfeeblement." * He showed that diachylon, of amount 
the size of a walnut, might contain 86 per cent, of oleate 
of lead and 467 grains of lead, and that half a dose was 
sufficient to produce prolonged disease. The pills contain 
but a small amount of lead. Quite recently medical 
evidence has shown that there appears to be an increasing 
use of lead as an abortifacient chiefly in an area of the 
Midlands bounded on the north by South Yorkshire, 
and on the south by Bedfordshire. But cases have been 
recorded in London and other parts. In the prescribed 
area some 200 cases have been met with recently. Dr. 
Hall, of Sheffield, believes that " several hundred women 
have taken diachylon in this district alone during the 
last two years." 2 He thinks there is evidence to show 
that the custom is spreading and is assuming serious 
proportions, that it is spread as information from woman 
to woman, and that it is responsible for a considerable 
degree of plumbism. The most frequent forms of this 
disease -are four, namely, brain disease, chronic disease 
of the peripheral nerves leading to "wrist drop" and 
other paralyses, colic, and chronic plumbic cachexia. It 
appears that in poisoning by diachylon the chief 
symptoms are those of acute lead-poisoning, colic with 
vomiting, constipation, and encephalopathy ; those attend- 
ing abortion ; and those of chronic lead-poisoning, such 
as anaemia and occasionally "wrist drop." In some cases 
it has caused death, and it is believed that short of that 
and short even of abortion the drug may exert injurious 
effects upon the infant.

Reality of Increase of Deaths from Premature Birth. 

It has been suggested that the rise in the mortality rate from 
premature births indicates merely an apparent increase owing to 
one of two causes : first, that there was a transference of deaths 
from general terms, such as atrophy and convulsions, to con- 
ditions which are now looked upon as congenital in origin ; and 
secondly, that the death registers now include a number of dead 
infants who would formerly have been buried as still-births. 
The former suggestion borrows support from the fact that infant 
deaths attributed to atrophy and convulsions have declined 
steadily since 1876, and that diagnosis is now more perfect. The 
latter gains plausibility from an alleged decline in still-births. 
But as still-births are not registered that is a difficult matter to 
measure. The argument for transference on account of more 
perfect diagnosis can only carry weight where it is found, that in 
actual practice medical knowledge has increased or medical 
appliance advanced in such a degree as to differentiate the finer 
points in medical diagnosis. But ability to certify prematurity 
as a cause of death was surely as much in evidence twenty years 
ago as it is to-day. In regard to the suggestion as to transference 
of still-births, Dr. McCleary has shown that in London in the 
decennial period, 1894-1903, the percentage of burials of still-born 
infants on total interments stood at about 5*5, and in the previous 
decennial period it was almost precisely the same. In any event 
there was no decline in the burial of still- births in the metropolis 
from 1 88 1 to 1900. But during the very same period the deaths 
from premature birth advanced in London from 13-2 to 197 per 
1,000 births. 1 But as I have already pointed out in a previous 
chapter, the deaths from premature birth have increased too 
greatly to be explained in this way. Moreover, they have in- 
creased in all kinds of districts, both urban and rural, varying 
enormously in external conditions. 

IV. IMMATURITY. 

This term is here used to include all those conditions 
of congenital disability other than prematurity. For it

84 INFANT MORTALITY 

happens that the conditions, which may end in a prema- 
ture birth or the death of the infant, produce in survivors 
closely allied physical deficiencies, but of a sort different 
in kind or degree, and which result not immediately in 
death but in physical under equipment. Atrophy, debility, 
some forms of " wasting " disease, congenital defects, non- 
expansion of the lungs (atelectasis) and general frailty are 
conditions of this kind. Infants thus heavily handicapped 
may yet survive for some weeks and even grow up to 
adult life. But the mark of death is upon them. 

On the whole this would appear to be a question of nutri- 
tion. It has been shown by Prochownick that the size of a 
child may be reduced by restricting the diet of the mother. 
He gives forty-eight cases in which as a result of such 
restriction the average weight of the child at birth was in 
24 males 2,960 grams, and in 24 females 2,735 grams, 
as compared with the normal weight of 3,333 grams 
and 3,200 grams respectively. The male children were, 
therefore, n per cent, and the female 14 per cent, below 
the average standard. From this it is perfectly clear 
that nutrition of the mother exerts an influence on the 
weight of her offspring. Noel Paton has shown by experi- 
ment similar results in the guinea-pig, an animal which 
breeds freely and enjoys a short period of gestation (10 
weeks). He found that the weight of young guinea-pigs 
of well-fed mothers is independent of the number in the 
litter, and that their weight bears a close relation to the 
weight of the mother. Another set of guinea-pigs were 
kept on a low diet, with the result that the weight of the 
heaviest litters following was 10 per cent, less per gram 
weight of mother than the smallest litter in the well-fed 
animals. The average weight of the litter was no less 
than 31 per cent, below that of normal animals. In no 
ca^e was there any indication that the births were 
premature, the young animals always presenting th 



ANTE-NATAL INFLUENCES 85 

character of full-time guinea-pigs and being active and 
vigorous. 

" These observations," writes Dr. Noel Paton, " although 
few in number, are so concordant that they warrant the 
conclusion that the size of the offspring depends very 
directly upon the diet and nutrition of the mother during 
pregnancy. While this explains the easy labours among 
the healthy lower classes, and confirms Prochownick's con- 
clusion that by dieting the mother the children of rickety 
women may be so reduced in size as to be viable, it also 
probably helps to explain the very high infant mortality 
among the very poor. The infant starts life at a low level, 
and readily succumbs to the hardships to which it is too often 
subjected. 

" To the physiologist, the point of chief interest seems 
to be the demonstration of the limitations in the extent to 
which the tissues of the mother can be utilised for the 
construction of the embryo. The nourishment of the 
maternal tissues seems to take precedence over the 
nutrition of the foetus. Were this not the case had the 
embryo the prior claim to nourishment we should find 
that in badly-nourished mothers each gram would pro- 
duce a greater proportionate weight of young than in 
well-nourished mothers. This is exactly the reverse of 
what occurs. The mother thus appears to pass on the 
surplus nourishment to the foetus ; and the better the 
nutrition of the maternal tissues, the greater is the growth 
of the young in utero" I 

Obvious as the teaching of these facts appears to be 
the evidence in actual life on this point of nourishment 
of the mother is conflicting and by no means so clear as 
people suppose. Few things are more remarkable in the 
life of the very poor than the apparent vigour and equip- 
ment of their offspring at the time of birth. There would

appear to be " a mean physical standard " which, as Pro- 
fessor D. J. Cunningham, the President of the Anthropo- 
metric Committee of the British Association, has said, 
seems to be " the inheritance of the people as a whole, and 
that no matter how far sections of the people may deviate 
from this by deterioration " owing to evil habit, poverty, 
or injurious or insanitary environment, " the tendency of 
the race as a whole will always be to maintain the in- 
herited mean." I Nature, so to speak, reverts to a type, 
and does not transmit inferior physical characters acquired 
from evil environment, but .only or chiefly those characters 
which are present in the individual at the time of birth. 
So that each generation of new-born infants tends to 
revert to the inherited mean. This does not indicate that 
the health or environment of the mothers during preg- 
nancy is of no account. For such is not the case. The 
physique of the mother does unquestionably exert an 
effect on her offspring, but the tendency of nature is on 
behalf of the infant. 2 It is well indeed that it is so, and it 



1 Rep. Interdepdrt. Com. on Phys. Deterioration, vol. ii. p. 97. 

2 In giving evidence before the Physical Deterioration Committee, Dr. 
Henry Ashby, of Manchester, said there were "three chief causes" of 
infant mortality, (a) heredity, (6) unintelligent mothering, and (c) effects 
of improper feeding. He further stated that " there are a large number 
of infants born who are weakly from the very first ; their start is a bad 
one ; they are, perhaps, late members of a large family in which the mother 
is exhausted with child-bearing as well as from the effects of hard work 
and poverty. Before, the child's birth development has been proceeding 
badly on account of the ill-health of the mother, and the infant comes 
into the world really handicapped from the very first. . . . The effects of 
poverty and hard work and weakness of the mother while the child is 
being formed in the womb do undoubtedly have the effect of producing 
weakly children, who either grow up weakly or die " (Report, vol. ii. 
p. 325). Subsequently Dr. Ashby emphasised this view in the Lancet 
(Oct. i, 1904) in the following words : 

" My own experience in the out-patient room entirely confirms the 
opinion that the nutrition of the mother has a very important bearing on 
the nutrition of the fcetus, and that the statement that the percentage of 
unhealthy births among the poor is small is not justified by facts. We 
constantly see fully developed infants a day or two old brought by mid- 
wives or neighbours exceedingly badly nourished, blue and feeble, and 
who are clearly ill-fitted, as the event indeed proves, to withstand the con- 



ANTE-NATAL INFLUENCES 87 

is this that brings, perhaps, 70-80 per cent. 1 of all new-born 
infants up to a mean physical standard in spite of ill- 
environment or the poverty of the mother's physique. In 
Finsbury we have recently made an extended inquiry 
through two trained lady visitors into the conditions of 
motherhood in 357 dead infants of the poor, special regard 
being paid (a) to the physique and health of the mother ; 
() to her past history in respect of miscarriage, abortion, 
and premature birth ; (c) to her general environment, 
poverty, and feeding ; and (d) to hard work during 
pregnancy. 

The 357 dead infants were subdivided into those dying 
from all causes within twelve months of birth, 175 similar 
deaths but within the first three months, and 1 1 1 which 
were deaths due to immaturity. 
The results have been as follows : 

(a) Of 357 infants dead of all causes, 140 mothers 
(39 P er cent.) had- a poor physique and a history 
of ill-health during and before pregnancy ; of 
175 infants dying in the first trimester of life 
86 mothers (or 49 per cent.) were in the same 
case ; and of 1 1 1 infants dying from immaturity 
62 mothers (or 55 per cent.) were physically 
unfit. 



ditions of an external existence. There must be numbers of such born in 
this city that perish within a few weeks of their birth, and who fail to 
thrive for even a day. There is no question of syphilis ; they are the 
children of poor mothers who have lived lives of hard wear and tear 
during pregnancy, are themselves badly nourished and weakly, and have 
felt the pinch of poverty, though often perhaps poverty of the secondary 
sort. I have a strong conviction also that the infants of the poorer and 
weaker mothers, even though they are born fairly well nourished, are 
difficult to rear, and easily waste even when under fairly favourable con- 
ditions in a home or hospital." A number of authorities hold similar 
views, and believe that the physique of the mother exerts a marked 
influence on the offspring. 

1 In Finsbury, of 1,859 mothers of the artisan class and of the class of 
very poor, as many as 73-5 per cent, gave birth to healthy infants, 15-0 per 
cent, to fair healthy, and 11-3 per cent, to unhealthy infants. 



88 INFANT MORTALITY 

(b) Of the 357 group 159 mothers (or 44 per cent.) 
had a previous history of miscarriage, abortion, 
or premature birth; of the 175 group 109 (or 
62 per cent.) had such a history ; and of the 1 1 1 
group 89 mothers (or 80 per cent.) had a history 
of previous catastrophe. 

fc) Of the 357 group 18 mothers (or 5 per cent.) had 
a pernicious social environment, and marked 
poverty and insufficiency of food ; of the 175 
group 15 mothers (or 8 per cent.) were in that 
case ; and of the 1 1 1 infants' deaths from im- 
maturity II mothers (or 10 per cent.) were in 
extreme poverty and insufficiency. 
(d} Of the 357 group 44 mothers (or 12 per cent.) 
were occupied during pregnancy in doing very 
hard work ; of the 175 group 35 mothers (or 
20 per cent.) were so occupied ; and of the 1 1 1 
group 27 (or 24 per cent.) were employed almost 
continuously through pregnancy in prolonged 
and hard work. A comparatively small per- 
centage of Finsbury married women are occu- 
pied in factories (not more than 12 per cent). 
The conclusions to be drawn from these figures as they 
concern immaturity are, briefly : 

First, that about half the mothers of infants dead of im- 
maturity suffer from marked ill-health and poor physique. 
As many as 174 out of the 357 mothers (48 per cent.) 
were unable to suckle their infants from " want of milk." 

Secondly, 80 per cent, of the mothers whose infants died 
of prematurity, congenital conditions, or debility, had 
previously had miscarriages, abortions, or premature births. 
This goes to support the view commonly held by medical 
men that a woman who has aborted once has a tendency to 
abort in future (15 per cent of the deaths were first children). 
Thirdly, that only 10 per cent, of the mothers of im- 



ANTE-NATAL INFLUENCES 89 

mature infants that died were underfed, though nearly a 
quarter of them had undergone exceptionally hard work 
during their pregnancy. 1 On the whole it may be more 
accurate to take underfeeding and overwork together. 
Work of itself, unless of an exceptionally straining cha- 
racter, seldom causes premature birth, but if combined 
with underfeeding and an insanitary environment the 
effect is almost certain to be injurious. 

An inquiry into the condition of new-born children by 
Dr. Sinclair in a district of Glasgow having a high infant 
mortality, showed that of 212 less than 9 per cent, of the 
" well-nourished," and less than 12 per cent, of the " fairly 
nourished " infants were artificially fed. Of obviously ill- 
nourished children, 22 per cent, were artificially fed, and 
this leaves a large proportion of badly nourished infants as 
being breast fed. Of the 212, 46 (or 2r6 per cent.) were 
found to be "badly nourished," and of the mothers of 
these 46 infants 39 per cent, were definitely underfed, 
39 per cent, were addicted to alcohol, and 41 per cent, 
were working away from home during pregnancy. The 
history of these 46 families in which the children were 
" badly nourished " showed that there had been 243 births 
and 85 infant deaths, yielding the high infant mortality of 
349 per 1,000 births. 2 

After a study of these findings in Finsbury and Glasgow 
it seems impossible to resist the conclusion that, in spite of 
the tendency of nature on behalf of the new-born child, 
poor physique and ill-nutrition of the mother exerts, in a 
considerable percentage of cases, an injurious effect upon 
the infant. Indeed, the facts presented throughout this 
chapter must surely leave but little doubt in the mind that 
pre-natal as well as post-natal conditions may exert a 
profound influence upon the problem of infant mortality. 

1 It should be added also that 24 per cent, of the immature infants were 
twin-births.

V 

THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN AND INFANT MORTALITY 

IN the middle of the eighteenth century industry in 
England was domestic, and spinning and weaving 
were done at home in the cottages. The man worked 
the loom, working what hours he pleased ; his wife and 
children spent their time spinning yarn. Spinning, in 
fact, was a by-industry practised as a subsidiary employ- 
ment when the day was ended and it was too dark to 
labour in the fields. There were, practically, no factories 
and no manufacturers in the modern sense. No machines 
were worked by power in the textile trades, except those 
used by Lombe at Derby. But in 1815 how complete is 
the contrast. We have the master and the mill. Men 
have become "hands," working regular hours. Women 
and children also have taken their places beside the 
machinery that is fast superseding all the old methods. 1 
The chief stages in that revolution were mainly the 
wonderful series of inventions made at the end of the 
eighteenth and in the nineteenth century, particularly in 
respect of the textile industries. Between 1761 and the 
end of the century we have the great inventions of 
Hargreaves (the carding machine and spinning jenny), 
of Arkwright (the rolling spinning frame), of Crompton 
(the spinning mule), of Cartwright, and others. And 
before them came Brindley's canals, and after them the

THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN 91 

epoch-making development of steam power. These 
changes, which worked an industrial revolution, pro- 
foundly affected the relations of master and servant. 
With machines which worked almost of themselves 
neither skill nor age was necessary. The labour of 
children and young persons was in demand, no appren- 
ticeship was needed for efficiency, every child of seven 
or eight years of age became a possible worker. In some 
instances even younger children were in the mills. These 
were not the only evils. The first factories erected were 
often unhealthy, badly ventilated, the machinery was un- 
fenced, and damages for which the workman had no 
redress were frequent. The system was described as 
making the machine every day more and more of a 
man, and the man more and more of a machine. The 
factory system here and elsewhere, at all events in certain 
districts, threatened to bring, about the physical, moral, 
and mental deterioration of large classes of the com- 
munity. 1 The first Factory Act was passed at the 
beginning of the last century ; and this idea of 
checking the evils which arose out of the factory 
system spread from this country to other countries, for 
wherever the factory system had arisen on any large scale 
the same evils had appeared, and so everywhere legislators 
endeavoured to regulate unhealthy industries, to limit the 
hours of labour of women and children, to insist that 
certain hygienic conditions should be complied with, and 
to protect the health and efficiency of the body of the 
worker as an important asset in the national life. Thus 
arose the necessity of taking measures to preserve it, and 
especially of saving women and children from work 
calculated to deteriorate generations to come. 3

articles in Oliver's Dangerous Trades (1902), pp. 24-62. 



92 INFANT MORTALITY 

It was not, however, till the middle of last century that 
the science of public health and preventive medicine was 
actually brought to bear upon these questions in their 
relation to infant mortality. 

Sir John Simon and his colleagues showed by their 
investigations into the sanitary condition of England 
between 1859 an< 3 1865 "that in proportion as adult 
women were taking part in factory labour or in agri- 
culture the mortality of their infants rapidly increased ; 
that in various registration districts which had such 
employment in them the district death rate of infants 
under one year of age had been from two and a quarter to 
nearly three times as high as in our standard districts ; and 
that in some of the districts more than a few of the infants 
were dying of ill-treatment, which was almost murderous." * 

Simon, indeed, believed that the " acute non-infectious 
diseases" (convulsions, diarrhoea, and respiratory inflam- 
mation), which caused the high infant mortality rates in the 
forties and fifties, were due to the varying prevalence of 
two local causes ; first, to differences of degree in common 
sanitary defects of residence, some places abounding more 
than others in the foul air and foul water of undrained, 
unpaved, unscavenged, unwashed, unlighted, and un- 
ventilated localities and houses ; and secondly, " to 
occupational differences among the inhabitants : there 
being certain large towns where women are greatly en- 
gaged in branches of industry away from home, where 
consequently these houses are ill-kept, where the children 
are little looked after, and where infants who should be at 
the breast are improperly fed or starved, or have their 
cries of hunger and distress quieted by those various fatal 
opiates which are in such request at the centres of our 
manufacturing industry." z

THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN 93 

Since the day when those words were penned, much has 
been done to elucidate the relation of the factory occupa- 
tion of women to infant mortality. The records of the 
work done, first by the pioneers, and latterly by 
medical officers and inspectors of the Home Office, the 
Local Government Board, and the 1,800 local authorities, 
the network of whose spheres of influence covers every 
inch of England, are among the most deeply interesting 
and even romantic labours ever performed in the service of 
a people. Nor has it been necessary in the intervening 
years since 1858 greatly to modify the view then ex- 
pressed by Sir John Simon that " infants perish under 
the neglect and mismanagement which their mothers' 
occupation implies!' But we must not anticipate. 

The inquiry into this subject was first prosecuted by 
Dr. Greenhow, who found in 1848-54 that in the four 
lace-making districts of Newport Pagnell, Bedford, 
Towcester, and Wycombe, the female death rate greatly 
exceeded the male death rate, particularly in pulmonary 
affections and phthisis. * The table on the following page 
shows the male and female pulmonary death rates in 
1848-54 in places "remarkable for the industrial employ- 
ment of women," and it may be quoted here as one of the 
first exact records ever made on this subject. 

This table shows that the higher the percentage of 
occupation of adult women in manufactures the higher 
was their pulmonary death rate, and that it compared 
unfavourably with similar death rates among men in 
the same towns, and also unfavourably with the total 
rates for England from these diseases. Little wonder 
that Dr. Greenhow concludes that " one of the most 
evident effects brought to light by the present investiga- 
tion is the influence of occupation on health. This

influence is either direct, as in the case of the cutlers 
of Sheffield, the lead miners of Alston, the lace makers 
of Towcester and Bedford, or the silk manufacturers of 
Macclesfield ; or it is indirect, as where the employment 
of women in factories seems to aggravate the infantile 
mortality." * 

This latter point it is necessary now to consider in some 
detail. But before doing so we cannot do better than

Dr. Greenhow, and their colleagues found to bear on the 
question half a century ago. These conditions are best

the main facts.

of the absence from work in consequence of child-bearing was 
five or six weeks ; many women among the highest class of 
operatives in Birmingham acknowledged to having generally 
returned to their work at the expiration of a month. x And it 
was stated that the factory women even sometimes return to work 
as early as eight or ten days or a fortnight after confinement. 
The mother's health suffers in consequence of this early return 
to labour, especially if, as is often the case, it is carried on in 
a standing position ; and the influence on the health and 
mortality of children is most baneful. . . . Mothers employed in 
factories are, save during the dinner hours, absent from home all 
day long, and the care of their infants during their absence is 
entrusted either to young children, to hired nurse-girls, some- 
times not more than eight or ten years of age, or perhaps more 
commonly to elderly women, who eke out a livelihood by taking 
infants to nurse. Young girls, aged seven or eight years, are 
frequently removed from school for the purpose of taking charge 
of younger children while the mother is absent at work, and are 
sometimes said to return, on the death of the child, evidently 
rather pleased that this event has released them from their 
toil. . . . Pap, made of bread and water, and sweetened with 
sugar or treacle, is the sort of nourishment usually given during 
the mother's absence, even to infants of a very tender age ; and 
in several instances little children not more than six or seven 
years old were seen preparing and feeding babies with this food, 
which in such cases consisted only of lumps of bread floating in 
sweetened water. . . . Illness is the natural consequence of this 
unnatural mode of feeding infants. . . . Children who are healthy 
at birth rapidly dwindle under the system of mismanagement, fall 
into bad health, and become uneasy, restless, and fractious. To 
remedy the illness caused by mismanagement various domestic 
medicines are administered, more particularly some kind of opiate 
such as Godfrey's cordial or laudanum. Wine, gin, peppermint, 
and other stimulants are often given, for the purpose, as alleged, 
of relieving flatulence, the actual effect being, however, rather to 
stupefy the child. The quantity of opiates sold for the purpose 

1 This is the period of abstention from work prescribed since 1891 under 
the Factory Act. 



96 INFANT MORTALITY 

of being administered to infants in some of the manufacturing 
towns is very large. . . . Indeed, there seems to be no doubt 
that the habitual administering of opiates to infants must be 
included among the causes of a high infantile mortality in certain 
manufacturing towns, not only on account of an overdose being 
given, but also because infants kept in a state of continued 
narcotism will be thereby rendered disinclined for food and be 
but imperfectly nourished. . . . Parents who thus entrust the 
management of their children so largely to strangers become 
more or less careless and indifferent about them, and as many 
of these children die, the mothers become familiarised with the 
fact, and speak of the deaths of their children with a degree of 
nonchalance rarely met with among women who devote them- 
selves mainly to the care of their offspring. . . . Abundant proof 
of the large mortality among the children of female factory 
operatives was obtained during the inquiry. An operative of the 
better class in Birmingham reported that he collects money for 
the expenses attendant on the deaths of children among the 
workers in a factory where 150 women were employed, and that 
he believed ten out of every twelve children born to the married 
women in this factory died within a few months after birth. 
Many married women were questioned, as opportunity served, in 
the several factories visited, regarding their families, the number 
of children they had borne, the number that survived, and the 
manner in which they were brought up. The evidence of these 
women tallied exactly with that of other persons. ... It was 
frequently found that two-thirds or three-fourths of the children 
borne to these women had died in infancy." 1 

On the other hand, as Dr. Greenhow wrote in his own 
report, it was remarkable how, in other instances, the 
majority of the children were reared when the mothers did 
not work in factories, or discontinued doing so whilst 
nursing, or when the infants' supplementary food consisted 
partly or chiefly of milk. 

Nor was it alone in the towns, as Sir John Simon 

1 Fourth Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council, 1861, 
pp. 187-196. 



THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN 97 

pointed out, that an unnecessarily high infant mortality 
occurred. 

" The discovery that an enormous infantile mortality was pre- 
vailing in several purely agricultural districts, suggested at first 
sight that perhaps in these districts some third sort of destructive 
influence was at work [in addition to the two influences named on 
p. 92]. The result of this new inquiry, however, has been to show 
that the monstrous infantine death rate of the examined agricultural 
districts depends only on the fact that there has been introduced 
into those districts the influence which has already been recog- 
nised as enormously fatal to the infants of manufacturing popula- 
tions the influence of the employment of adult women. ' The 
opinions,' says Dr. Hunter, ' of about seventy medical practi- 
tioners, with those of other gentlemen acquainted with the 
conditions of the poor, were obtained. With wonderful accord, 
the cause of the mortality was traced by nearly all these well- 
qualified witnesses to the bringing of the land under tillage 
that is to the cause which has banished malaria and has 
substituted a fertile though unsightly garden for the winter 
marshes and summer pastures of fifty or a hundred years ago. 
It was generally thought that the infants no longer received any 
injury from soil, climate, or malarious influences, but that a 
more fatal enemy had been introduced by the employment of 
the mothers in the field.' On this agricultural employment of 
women there follow identically the same results as have been 
traced to result from the employment of women in manufacture." ' 

On surveying all the facts which he had collected, Dr. 
Greenhow arrived at the following conclusions : 

First, that the infantile death rate bears no definite 
relation to the general death rate, but their comparative 
proportions to each other vary in different districts. 

Secondly, that the infantile death rate bears the largest 
proportion to the general death rate in districts where the 
infantile population is specially exposed to unwholesome 

1 Fourth Report of the Medical Officer of the Privy Council, 1861. 
H 



98 INFANT MORTALITY 

influences, as in Coventry, Nottingham, and certain other 
manufacturing towns. 

Thirdly, that the unwholesome influences to which 
infants are exposed in the manufacturing towns comprised 
in the present inquiry may be attributed mainly to the 
industrial employment of the married women, which leads 
them to consign the tendance of their infants at a very 
early age to young children or strangers. 

Fourthly, that infants thus deprived of the mother's 
care are habitually fed on diet ill adapted to their digestive 
powers, and are very frequently drugged with opiates, in 
order to allay the fractiousness arising from the illness 
induced by improper food. 

Fifthly, that infants in manufacturing towns where women 
are much engaged in factory labour are likewise exposed 
to other causes of sickness, proceeding from the ignorance 
or carelessness of the mothers or nurses, such as deficiency 
of exercise and exposure to inclement weather." * 

Several years before the above conclusions were stated, 
Dr. Greenhow had shown that circumstances attendant 
on a town life were largely operative in the production 
of the chief diseases of infancy, which, in 1858, appeared to 
be pulmonary diseases, diarrhoea, and convulsions. He 
had shown also that infant mortality was higher in manu- 
facturing towns than in others, that it was higher in those 
manufacturing towns in which much female labour was in 
request, and highest of all, in his opinion, where female 
labour was occupied away from home, and that this last 
condition brought about a higher infant death rate even if 
the district were a rural one. 2 

We cannot now, with the new facts and experience of 
half a century behind us, wholly subscribe to these conclu- 
sions. But broadly they represent the position, and it is 

1 Loc. cit., p. 196.

now necessary to examine into the evidence in support of 
them at present existing. 

Of the 13,189,585 females in England and Wales over 
the age of ten years, 4,171,751, or 3r6 per cent., were 
returned in 1901 as engaged in occupations. They may 
be tabulated thus :

Unfortunately, however, the figures relating to domestic 
service in the 1891 census -were not strictly comparable 
with those for other censuses, and therefore it is not 
possible to say definitely that the proportion of women 
occupied was really higher at all age groups in 1891 than 
1901. But, on the whole, it works out for England and 
Wales in the total as a decrease from 26*4 per cent, 
of females engaged in occupation in 1891 to 24^8 in 
1901. If, however, domestic servants be excluded from 
both sets of figures the returns for 1901 show an increase 
over those for the preceding census in the proportions 
occupied at ages 15 to 25, but a decrease at every group 
above 25 years. 1 Thus there appears to have been in 
occupations other than domestic indoor service a substitu- 
tion of younger for older women, which involves also a 
substitution of the unmarried for the married or widowed, 
and consequently a decrease in the employment of the 
latter. Further, in 1901, the proportion of occupied

INFANT MORTALITY 



females was higher in the towns than in the country at 
all ages. 

The avocations of the four millions of occupied females 
over ten years of age are distributed broadly as follows : 
About 40 per cent, are employed in domestic service, and 
as charwomen or laundry workers ; i6J per cent, in 
making articles of dress ; 14 per cent, in textile manu- 
factures ; 8 per cent, in various other manufactures ; 
7 per cent, as shopkeepers, shop assistants, &c ; 4 per cent, 
in teaching, and 3 per cent, in services connected with 
hotels, inns, boarding-houses, restaurants, &c. This leaves 
about 7 per cent, as engaged in other undefined occupa- 
tions. For convenience the following table may be added :

THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN 101 

From these census returns it would appear that of the 
total female population over ten years of age of thirteen 
millions, four millions are occupied. And of the four 
millions nearly two millions are engaged in domestic 
occupations (including laundry work), and one and a half 
millions in textile work, dress, and potteries. Some of 
this work is regulated under the Factory and Workshop 
Act, much of it is unregulated, and all of it is of a nature 
very difficult to analyse. There is no record obtainable 
showing the occupation of those women who become 
mothers, though it might easily have been obtained 
through the registrars of births. Therefore it is necessary 
for us to consider what light upon the problem before us 
can be obtained from elsewhere. 

The census return for 1901 supplies a large body of 
useful facts respecting the percentage and age of the 
female population occupied ;n administrative counties and 
in towns. Unfortunately, from the point of view of the 
present inquiry, these figures include that vast indefinite 
group of occupations known as " domestic," carried on for 
the most part in the home. And even so the local varia- 
tions in the percentage of women occupied are much 
greater than in the case of males, ranging from i6'2 per 
cent, in the county of Durham to 56-8 per cent, in the 
county borough of Blackburn. The lowest proportions 
are naturally found in districts where the prevailing 
industries are such as can only be followed by males. 
Such, for example, occur in the Middlesbrough district, 
Barrow-in-Furness, Burton-on-Trent, and Devonport. 

It is then to these facts of the census that the inquiring 
minds of investigators into this intricate problem of infant 
mortality have turned. Some have taken the counties, 
comparing the varying rates of infant mortality with the 
percentage of all women and of married women occupied. 
But the results are almost valueless, and except very 



102 INFANT MORTALITY 

generally indicate but little. For example, here are 
Northumberland and Durham with a high infant mortality 
and some 32 per cent, of women occupied, and here are 
Dorset and Westmoreland or Herefordshire and Wiltshire, 
all of them with the lowest infant death rates in the 
country, and yet with nearly 50 per cent, of women 
occupied. There is here, of course, abundant fallacy, 
derivable not only from the differences of trade, but also 
from the inclusion of domestic occupations, the whole being 
further complicated by the area involved in the counties. 

For these reasons other investigators with more reason 
have turned to the towns. They have tabulated "the 
high mortality towns " in one class, and " the low mortality 
towns " in another. One such table is before me. Each 
class contains ten towns, the former yielding an average 
infant mortality rate of 190 per 1,000, the latter 153. The 
high mortality towns further average 62 per cent, of 
occupied women, 21 per cent, being married. The low 
mortality towns average, on the other hand, a mortality 
among infants of 153 per 1,000, and percentages of 
occupied women and occupied married women of 58 and 
13 respectively. Now these twenty towns cover a wide 
field. They are representative and include a number of 
manufacturing towns of widely different character, as well 
as smaller trading towns, one residential town, and several 
of mixed character. It is this very width of survey which 
introduces fallacy, and yet, taken as a whole, the two lists 
show a distinct correspondence between infant mortality 
and the occupation of women. The high mortality towns 
have a higher percentage of occupied women than the 
lower mortality towns, and the difference is more marked 
in regard to married women than to all women. So far, 
so good. But as the tabulator fully admits, beyond this 
broad conclusion discrepancies appear, the most marked 
of which is that among the high mortality towns are some

103 



with a low proportion of occupied women. The high 
death rate among infants in these towns is therefore 
attributed to other conditions, and chiefly to a higher 
birth rate. But this is scarcely admissible, for in point of 
fact differences between the birth rates in all the towns 
are comparatively small, and do not extend over a genera- 
tion. Moreover, the birth rates are for 1901, though the 
infant death rates are 1890-1903. 

As a matter of fact, as I have said, the very width of the 
field covered in any such comparisons introduces a serious

fallacy. To arrive at accurate results as to the relation, 
if any, which exists between occupation of women and 
infant mortality, it is necessary (a) to compare towns 
which are comparable, the occupied female population of 
which is engaged in similar trades ; (d) to take the per- 
centage of occupied women and occupied married women 
at the child-bearing age ; and (c) to look mainly to occupa- 
tions away from home. Bearing these three requirements 
in mind, let us take some representative towns in which 
the textile trade (in which women are mostly employed) 
provides the chief occupation of the occupied women 



104 



INFANT MORTALITY 



away from home. As fair examples we may take six 
towns in the centre of the cotton trade Burnley, Preston, 
Blackburn, Oldham, Bolton, and Bury and two others, 
which represent a greater variety of occupation, but still 
in the main are textile Nottingham and Leicester. These 
towns may be placed in the order of their infant mortality, 
and the returns for 1901 as to the occupied women and 
the occupied married women placed opposite each, as 
in table on the previous page. 

This arrangement gives a clearer view of the relation 
existing between women occupied in a similar way and 
the infant mortality rate. The infant mortality rate is for 
a decennial period made up of five years each side the 
census year. Compare these figures with the following 
table, comprising eight towns selected, not as having a 
particularly low infant mortality rate, but as having a low 
percentage of occupied women.

The towns in the former table have a higher percentage 
of occupied women than in the latter, though the difference 
is less marked in regard to married women than to all 
women. The average percentage of occupied women in 
the latter table is 307 less than in the textile towns, and

105 



the average percentage of married women who are occu- 
pied is 19-1 less than in the textile towns. The difference 
in the average infant mortality is 32 per 1,000 on the 
decennium. 

But if now we go a step further and introduce a com- 
parison between the percentage of occupied women 
married and unmarried, and the percentage of such women 
occupied at the period of child-bearing activity, or rather 
reproductive potentiality (15-35), we obtain the following 
figures for the textile towns :

1 In 1904 the infant mortality rate was 233. In order to bring about a 
decrease in this high death rate the Corporation has engaged three lady 
sanitary inspectors, and has opened a sterilised milk depot. But the 
Medical Officer believes the principal cause is the factory occupation of 
women. He writes : " Burnley is the largest textile manufacturing town 
in Europe, that is, it contains more looms for the weaving of cloth than 
any other town or city, and, as a larger number of women than men are 
employed in weaving, it follows that many infants are put out to nurse 
whilst the mothers are engaged in the weaving shed. When infants a 
few weeks old are thus put into the hands of unskilful nurses, it becomes 
certain that the food will be at times unsuitable, and the natural require- 
ments of the infant not attended to. A sensible mother's care is necessary 
for the up-bringing of a healthy child, and this motherly care cannot be 
obtained where mothers are extensively employed in factories. It need 
excite no surprise, then, that in manufacturing towns the infant mortality 
is large, very much greater than in non-textile towns where mothers 
usually nurse their own children and are not compelled to put them out 
to nurse " (Rep. on Health of Burnley, 1904, p. 5). 

* There are, it appears, some favourable social conditions in Bolton 
which may in part account for its somewhat lower infant mortality than 
say, Burnley. See Industrial Efficiency, vol. i. pp. 68-83.

It will be seen at once that these more apposite figures 
from the point of view of infant mortality tell the same 
story. The high-mortality or textile towns have a higher 
percentage of occupied women at child-bearing ages than 
the low-mortality towns (28'9) a percentage almost equal 
to that shown in the previous tables. But the percentage 
of occupied married women at child-bearing ages in the 
textile towns is 40 per cent, higher than in the low-mortality 
towns. This is more than double the difference shown in 
the former tables. A difference so marked as this demon- 
strates surely, beyond all question, that there is an in- 
timacy if not a relationship at least a correspondence 
existing between the occupation of married women and 
a high infant mortality. 

Now whilst it is evident that the correspondence between 
the percentages of women at child-bearing ages and the 
infant mortality is intimate and possibly indicates a re- 
lationship of cause and effect, it is also clear that even so 
there are discrepancies. Miss Collett endeavoured to 
determine a relationship in this matter, the results of 



THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN

which also showed discrepancy, which she thought might 
be amended by comparing the infant mortality with the 
percentage of domestic servants in certain towns. 1 The 
following is a table showing the results of both com- 
parisons :

This view contends that the lower the percentage of 
domestic servants the lower the social standard and the 
greater the poverty, and therefore the higher the infant 
mortality, which, thus viewed, is more nearly related to 
home conditions than factory conditions. In a general 
way this is undoubtedly true, and much of the evidence 
furnished in the present book lends support to it. At the 
same time it is important to remember, as Farr pointed 

1 Jour, of Statistical Soc., 1898, vol. Ixi. pp. 217-270 (Miss Clara E. 
Collett, M.A.). 



108 



INFANT MORTALITY 



out in 1871, that even in towns where the census returns 
credited a large domestic occupation of women at home, 
infant mortality might still be high. Farr showed that in 
Oldham of women above 20 years of age 346 per 1,000 
were engaged in the textile factories, and 493 per 1,000 in 
domestic duties, and the infant mortality rate was 180 
per 1,000; whereas in Leicester 122 per 1,000 worked in 
factories and 543 at home, and the infant mortality was 
217; at Leeds 93 per 1,000 women over 20 years of age 
worked in factories and 658 per 1,000 at home, but the 
infant mortality was 201 ; and, lastly, he selected Norwich 
where only 58 per 1,000 worked in factories and 539 at 
home, and yet the infant mortality was 183, higher even 
than Oldham. 

The textile towns are not peculiar in possessing a high 
infant mortality associated with a high percentage of occu- 
pied married women at child-bearing ages. The towns in the 
Potteries yield a similar result. Hanley, with 787 per cent, 
of occupied women at child-bearing ages (15-35), and 
23 per cent, of married women at the same age period, has 
had an infant mortality rate in the last decennium (1896- 
1905) of 204 per 1,000. Longton, with an even larger per- 
centage of occupied women, had an infant mortality rate 
(1895-1904) of 234. 

Dr. Reid, the Medical Officer of Health for the County 
of Stafford, has repeatedly drawn attention to a number of 
the Staffordshire towns which year after year have a high 
infant mortality. The following is a table from his report 
for 1903 :

THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN 



This mortality is attributed by the District Medical 
Officers to " neglect and ignorance," or " sanitary defects," 
or " ignorance of proper feeding," but the County Medical 
Officer urges that the excessive mortality which he finds to 
exist in varying degree in twenty-six artisan towns is " attri- 
butable to the nature of the trades carried on as affecting the 
facilities for the employment of women away from home, 
and as a consequence the proportion of wholly artificially- 
fed to entirely or partially breast-fed infants." 1 He 
furnishes the following interesting table which leads to the 
same conclusions as the tables I have already discussed :

These figures are emphatic, though perhaps less so than 
in a similar table for Lancashire. And for a very simple 
reason, in Lancashire there are seven times more married 
women employed than in Staffordshire. 

Nor are the pottery towns any more exceptional than 
the textile towns. Broadly, it is true that to whatever 
town or district we turn the same general conclusion is 
inevitable, namely, that where there is very much occupa- 
tion of women away from home, there will be found as a 
rule a high infant death rate, unless there are exceptional 
circumstances counteracting it. The following table of 
districts and towns not hitherto mentioned, with an infinite

But the mere fact of extensive employment of women, 
and particularly of mothers in factories, cannot be regarded 
as significant of itself. To gauge the effect of such employ- 
ment on the children of such women reference must be 
made to some of the following factors which play a part in 
the problem, namely, (#) the character and condition of 
the work, () the length of hours, (r) employment before 
and after childbirth, and (d) the sanitation of factories and 
workshops. To these also should be added the variations 
in the birth rate prevalent in different trades, the effect of 
certain industries upon maternity in the way of raising (if 
such be possible) or reducing the standard and practice of 
mothers as to the care of infants, and, lastly, the causes 
of the mothers' employment. 

I. THE CHARACTER AND CONDITION OF THE WORK. 

A moment's reflection will make it evident that it is not 
what is called " the factory system," which per se exerts an 
injurious influence upon women, and particularly married 
women, engaged in one or other of the many industries in 



THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN 111 

which women are now employed. It is rather the condi- 
tions which obtain and the neglect of home life which is 
involved in certain trades or in certain factories. The 
mere fact of a woman working for a livelihood, be it in a 
factory or workshop, or be it at home, does not necessarily 
affect her health, or, if she become a mother, the health of 
her offspring. Many and various conditions which may 
arise therefrom furnish the real influences which are 
injurious. Some of these are considered elsewhere in 
the present volume, but here it is necessary to discuss 
those which are directly associated with the factory 
environment. 

We may take it as a general axiom that both unmarried 
and married women enter factories as a rule to gain a 
necessary livelihood and not merely to make " pin-money." 
Occasionally one comes across women thus working for 
the pleasure of it, or to occupy their time, or to obtain a 
personal remuneration not absolutely necessary to their 
living. But such cases are the exception, and the very 
rare exception in married women. The latter work either 
because the industry of the locality is mainly a woman's 
industry (as in Blackburn, Preston, or Dundee), or in order 
to eke out the failing wage of a sick or unemployed 
husband. They are frequently persons struggling against 
adversity and endeavouring in an unequal combat to act as 
wage-earner and house-mother. And experience shows 
that as a rule it cannot be done without evil results. For 
in addition to the natural anxiety and stress thus thrown 
upon the woman there are the added strains of factory life, 
such as piece-work, hard physical labour, injurious trade 
processes, fatigue, and so forth. Some of these must now 
be considered. 

In some trades women act as beasts of burden. In 
brick-making, tin-plate works, iron hollow-ware, certain 
hardware trades, some jam and sauce factories, mat- 



112 INFANT MORTALITY 

makers, postcard manufacturers, and other industries, 
women are not infrequently employed in carrying or 
lifting weights which cannot fail to exert serious injury 
to some. 1 " Many are the complaints of weariness and 
overstrain," writes a lady factory inspector, " made to me 
by girls and young women some of them mothers who 
are too poor or too unskilled to leave an employment 
which is making too great a demand upon their physical 
powers, and which in some instances has caused serious 
injury." 2 Nor is lifting or carrying heavy weights by any 
means the only physical strain which women undergo in 
many trades, as becomes very apparent if one studies the 
records of women's labour in brushmaking, in the linen 
industry, as hat furriers, or as laundresses. 

The results of fatigue become manifest in various 
ways, not the least being the occurrence of accident or 
of physical breakdown^ The former, as is now well 

1 The following may be cited as examples : Girls carrying 72 Ibs. of 
bricks resting on a pad strapped on the hips ; wheeling barrows con- 
taining 40 bricks weighing 9 Ibs. each ; pushing buggies containing 100 
bricks of same weight ; handling clay during " walk-flatting," weighing 
35 tons every day, &c. Four women employed solely as clay carriers, 
each making 128 journeys a day, some of which, as the factory is a large 
one, are a fair distance, and at each journey carrying a piece of clay 
weighing half a cwt. Young women of superior class employed in 
counting and packing postcards lift and carry from cutting machine to 
their benches stout wooden iron-bound boxes containing 12,600 to 13,440 
postcards, weighing up to 138 Ibs. Women and girls carrying bulky bags 
of cocoa-nut mat weighing 48 Ibs. to 59 Ibs. Girls carrying pans of boiling 
jam weighing about I cwt. each. Annual Report of Chief Inspector of 
Factories, 1902, p. 173 ; 1903, p. 221 ; 1904, p. 267. 

2 Ibid., 1900, p. 375. 

3 There are two forms of fatigue fatigue of the motor system and 
fatigue of the nervous system. " When fatigue [of the motor system] is 
caused by activity of the large muscle masses, it is not in them mainly that 
the troubles appear, but much more in the circulatory and respiratory 
system ; if the fatigue is very considerable the troubles pass to the digestive 
and urinary system. The most exact measure of fatigue is given by com- 
parative analysis of the respiratory gaseous exchange during and after 
work, consumption being so much the greater for a given amount of work 
as the fatigue is the greater. Close examination of the pulse reveals, in 
increasing length of the systole and diminution of the diastolic pause of 
the heart, good criteria of fatigue. Loss of body weight, caused by the 
fact that activity of the digestive system does not grow at the same rate as 



THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN 113 

recognised, occur most frequently in fatigued workers. 
For example, since 1900 there has been a steady, though 
not marked, increase in the number of accidents to 
women over 18 years of age in laundries. In 1900 
such accidents numbered 131 ; in 1904, 157. Now it 
has been shown that whilst the first half of the day 
yields about the same number of accidents as the second 
half, more accidents, amounting to nearly double the 
number, occur between the hours of 1 1 a.m. and I p.m., 
and between 4 p.m. and 7 p.m., than at any other time of 
the day. 

The latter, physical breakdown, is more apparent in 
certain trades than others, and more frequently occurs 
than is supposed. Dr. McCleary, for instance, has shown 
that phthisis was more prevalent among laundresses 
attending the Wandsworth and Clapham Union Infir- 
mary from 1895-1903 than among other occupied women, 
or among unoccupied women. Between the ages of 15-25 
years io - 6 per cent, of all the cases of phthisis occurred 
in laundresses as compared with 3*2 per cent, in other 
occupied women, and 3^9 per cent, in unoccupied women. 1 
There are other trades, such as working in lead, in the 
potteries, as hat furriers, or in the linen industry, and 
elsewhere, which reveal a marked degeneration in the 
physique of women. In England, lead-poisoning shows a 
substantial decline from 1,258 cases, notified to the Chief 
Inspector of Factories in 1899, to 597 cases notified in 
1904. The chief incidence of the disease falls upon 
workers in white lead, and next upon china and earthen- 

the work, shows, when regular work is in quest, that work is excessive. In 
the case of acute overstrain it is above all the kidneys that should be kept 
under observation. Appearance of albumen and casts in the urine reveals 
a trouble which may quickly disappear with rest, but which, nevertheless, 
is not negligeable." Dr. Ziintz in the Ann. Rep. of Chief Inspector of 
Factories, 1903, p. 307. See also Dangerous Trades (1902), pp. 104-117 
(Dr. Oliver on " Physiology and Pathology of Work and Fatigue "). 
1 Report on Health of Battersca, 1903, p. 129. 



114 INFANT MORTALITY 

ware workers. It will be necessary to refer to lead- 
poisoning in women subsequently. Dr. Glibert, Principal 
Medical Inspector of Factories in Belgium, considers 
that hat-furriers' work is distinctly injurious, but not so 
serious and undermining to health as lead-working. He 
found 68 per cent, of women employed as hat furriers 
to have good health, 65 per cent, in the linen industry, 
and 84 per cent, of rag pickers. 1 

The same observer found only 65 per cent, of the 
women employed in the linen industry in Belgium had 
good health, which deteriorates part passu with their age. 
The health of women is more gravely affected than that 
of the male workers because the women begin at a much 
earlier age in the linen industry, 53*4 per cent, of the 
women employed in spinning having commenced work 
before attaining their twelfth year. More than half the 
women are married. Dr. Glibert also shows that the 
influence of illness in early childhood, and the employ- 
ment of the mother, exert an unfavourable effect on 
women in this industry when their turn has come to go 
to work. 2 

The general effect of the factory system, when im- 
properly controlled, is witnessed at Dundee, where 24,879 
women and girls are employed in the jute and hemp 
factories (9,479 men are also employed). In the same 
town another 3,000 women are employed in other textile 
works. As many as 16 per cent, of all the girls in 
Dundee, between the ages of 10 and 14, are employed in 
these trades. The corresponding figures for Glasgow are 
3 per cent. Jute is used for the manufacture of sacking, 
coarse cloths, cheap carpets, curtains, and furniture hang- 
ings, &c., and this industry is almost confined to Dundee. 
The average wages for women are below I2s. per week in 

1 Ann. Rep. of Chief Inspector of Factories, 1903, p. 300. 

2 Ibid., 1902, pp. 284-293. 



THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN 115 

eight processes, and above I2s. but under i8s. for the 
remaining five processes. The women are largely 
employed in the preparing processes, which for the 
most part require little skill, and in the spinning flats. 
One quarter of the women, or about 6,000, are married. 

"To a great extent, owing no doubt to the want of 
well-paid employment for men, a very large proportion 
of the women have to neglect their homes in order to 
earn subsistence, or else to wear themselves out in an 
attempt to be both bread-winner and house-mother. 
The extent to which the work of the jute mills, and 
especially the roughest kind of the work, is carried on 
by married women and by children, is a matter which 
must give serious concern to those who are interested 
in the development of Dundee, and in the health and 
character of its people. The wages earned in the mills 
are not such as will permit the employment of a 
substitute who will give proper oversight to the house, 
and most often the baby is left in charge of a grand- 
mother or some already burdened neighbour, while the 
street is the refuge of the bigger children. Engaged 
from six in the morning until six in the evening in the 
dust and heat and noise of a jute or flax mill, can we 
wonder that when she reaches home she is without 
strength or interest to make her then take up her 
domestic duties, and that the number of those who do 
make an effort to do the work of two women is not a 
large one." l 

Further, it has been found that Dundee boys and 
girls, between the ages of n and 15 years, are much 
below the average standard both in height and in 
weight. One of the factory inspectors writes of them 
as follows : 

1 Ann. Rep. of Chief Inspector of Factories, 1901, p. 183-184 (Miss 
Paterson). 



116 INFANT MORTALITY 

Many of these children are born and brought up in single- and 
double-roomed houses, or in large tenements, where the condi- 
tions of life are almost as unnatural and injurious as it is possible 
to imagine. Overcrowding often exists, in conjunction with 
general squalor, and intemperance on the part of one or both 
parents. Injudicious and unsuitable feeding during the susceptible 
period of infancy, exposure to inclement weather, and general 
neglect appear to be largely the cause of infantile deaths, as the 
children who survive seem to suffer more or less from weak 
constitutions throughout life. The latter class are often very 
short and far below the normal standard in weight. Undoubtedly 
factory life, although not specially injurious to workers who have 
naturally strong constitutions or who commence labour after 
having reached maturity, nevertheless neither fosters growth nor 
development, and has a distinctly harmful effect on undersized 
or badly nourished young persons. Thus I have frequently 
conversed with full-grown men of twenty years and upwards who 
do not stand more than five feet or five feet one inch in height 
and who scale less than nine stone. These men have not the 
physical strength for heavy manual labour, or indeed any task 
which demands prolonged effort, but must accept unskilled 
labourers' wages in mills or factories all their lives. Such wages 
are usually very small and quite inadequate to support a wife and 
family. The degeneracy exhibited in males is similarly remarked 
in females, but in a slightly less degree. The present race of 
mill workers in Dundee are the descendants of generations of 
operatives, there being little intermarriage in this class with 
persons of rural origin. The operatives in the surrounding towns 
of Forfar, Arbroath, and Brechin are taller and more robust 
looking than their colleagues in Dundee. 1 

It will not surprise the reader of these reports on 
Dundee to learn that the infant mortality rate is excep- 
tionally high, and for the decennial period 1893-1902 was 
176 per 1,000 births. In 1904 it was 174. There were 
788 infant deaths, 129 of which (or i6'4 per cent.) occurred 
within the first week. Out of these 129 deaths, 125 were 

1 Ann. Rep. of Chief Inspector of Factories, 1900, p. 336. 



THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN 117 

medically certified as due to prematurity and immaturity. 
Almost exactly half (393) of the total infant deaths (788) 
occurred in the first three months of life. The chief 
diseases which caused this high infant death rate were 
prematurity and immaturity, 287 per cent, of the total ; 
bronchitis, 23*3 per cent. ; gastro-intestinal disease and 
malnutrition, 21*6 ; and zymotic disease (tuberculosis, 
whooping-cough, measles, and other infectious diseases), 
1 1 '6. Inquiry was made into the social conditions of the 
home life of 364 of these infant deaths, to the findings of 
which we refer elsewhere. Here it may be added that the 
occupations, or former occupations, of the mothers of 
these dead infants were as follows : 84 weavers, warpers, 
or winders, 105 spinners, piecers, or shifters, 88 preparers, 
12 sack machinists or sack sewers, 27 miscellaneous, 
20 unoccupied, and 25 concerning which there was no 
return obtainable. 1 Of the cases inquired into 13*2 per 
cent, of these mothers worked at the factory to within a 
week of childbirth. Fifteen' women worked to within 
a few hours of childbirth. 

It is interesting to compare the condition of things 
existent in Dundee with those obtaining in Paisley, 
where female labour also predominates, although the 
population is smaller. Dr. Robb, the medical officer of 
health, writes to me that the total number of women 
employed in Paisley is approximately 14,500, of whom 
9,250 are engaged at textile fabrics, and 1,000 at dress- 
making. In textile fabrics, probably 8,500 are employed 
in one cotton thread factory, which possesses the following 
characteristics, namely (a) it is excellently kept, the 
conditions surrounding the workers being of the best, 
and () nearly all the women employed are unmarried. 
In some bleaching and finishing works in Paisley there 
are some married women employed, but most of these 

1 Rep. of Dundee Social Union, 1905, pp. 73~74-

INFANT MORTALITY 



have grown-up families. Dr. Robb adds, that as far as 
he can form an opinion, " the practice of married women 
working right up to the time of their confinement, and 
returning to work immediately after that event, practically 
does not exist in Paisley." There appears also to be 
a greater amount of interest taken by their employers in 
the women workers than occurs in Dundee, the occupation 
of married women being discouraged. 1 The infant 
mortality rate for Paisley during the last three years 
has been in 1902, 121 ; in 1903, 129-4 5 an d m I 9O4> I 33'8, 
as compared with an average of 175 in Dundee. 

Quite apart, however, from particular towns there appear 
to be conditions in special industries which call for mention. 
On this point of difference of industry Dr. Arthur 
Shadwell has recently furnished some interesting notes. 2 
He compares textile towns in Saxony with metal towns 
in the Ruhr district of Westphalia. I have chosen eleven 
typical towns in the former to compare with the eleven 
towns selected by him in the latter.

Dusseldorff has a birth rate of 38*0, a death rate of 187, and an infant 
mortality of 206. 

It will be noticed at once that both textile and metal 
towns have a high infant mortality rate. Then it will be 
seen that the textile infant mortality is much above the 
metal, but that the birth rate in the former is low and 
in the latter is high. Dr. Shadwell holds that the birth 
rate is usually low in textile towns (247 in England and 
35-5 in Germany) and high in metal towns (33*9 in 
England and 46*2 in Germany). 1 Finally, it will be 
observed that the general death rate is lower in the 
textile towns, though the infant mortality is so much 
higher, than in the metal towns. These figures are cer- 
tainly deeply interesting, and denote, one must add, a 
condition of things open to grave apprehension. It is 
difficult to select from Dr. ShadwelFs absorbing chapter 
on the conditions of life obtaining in industrial Germany. 
On the whole, however, what strikes one most is the marked 
vitality a high birth rate, a fairly low death rate, and a 
not very high infant mortality of the metal towns as

120 INFANT MORTALITY 

compared with, say, Chemnitz. This town, it appears, 
is overcrowded, and tenement life is universal. In the 
most densely populated parts the number of persons to 
a house may run to 130 or 173. The medical officer of 
health of Chemnitz ascribes the high infant mortality to 
lack of medical advice, bad housing, overcrowding, bad 
feeding, and dirty feeding-bottles all of which condi- 
tions, as Dr. Shadwell remarks, are not peculiar to 
Chemnitz. The real explanation is probably this : " In 
Saxony wages are low," writes Dr. Shadwell, "and the 
people have never learnt to enjoy and look for a standard 
of comfort." They still take life as it comes, and the 
children are weak, " and the parents let them die." They 
do not call in a doctor, nor do they tend the child with 
carefulness and knowledge. "They take death as it 
comes ; it is part of life. And more children succumb 
in textile than in other districts because the mothers go 
out to work. This may seem very sad and shocking, but 
the alternatives are worse." * 

II. LENGTH OF HOURS OF WORK. 

In the English textile factories there is a twelve-hours' 
day with two hours for meals ; on Saturdays six hours, 
and half an hour ; work not to continue more than 4^ 
hours at a stretch without a break of at least half an hour. 
Overtime, except under special circumstances, and Sunday 
and all-night work is prohibited. The annual holidays 
are Christmas Day, Good Friday, and four Bank Holidays. 
These limits work out at 65-66 hours per week, and about 
3,400 hours per annum. In 1901 there were in the United 
Kingdom 867,259 women occupied in textile fabrics. 

In the non-textile factories and workshops the same 
hours obtain, except on Saturday, when the standard is 
eight hours with ij hours for meals, stretch of work not to 
1 Industrial Efficiency, vol. i. p. 237. 



THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN 121 

continue beyond five hours without a break. Overtime is 
allowed up to two hours on three days a week, and thirty 
days a year, with extra half-hour for meal. The holidays 
are the same as in textile factories. These limits work out 
at a minimum of 66 hours per week. 

In " women's workshops " other than domestic work- 
shops and laundries, the same hours hold except that there 
the five hours' spell may be exceeded, and there is no 
overtime allowable. In domestic workshops women's 
hours, meal-times, holidays, and overtime are all entirely 
unregulated, and depend upon pressure, need, and physical 
endurance. In laundries 60 hours is the weekly limit 
exclusive of meal-times. Overtime is permitted three 
days a week or thirty days in the year, without extra 
meal-time, and Sunday and all-night work is allowed. 

Finally, there are certain processes, such as fish-curing, 
fruit-cleaning, &c., in which women are engaged which are 
exempted from regulation for hours of employment. In 
a general way it may be said -that the hours of women's 
employment, according to statute, vary from 60-70 hours 
per week. 

The question remains as to infringement of these limits. 
Of this we can only judge in part, for it is a difficult 
matter to check. But since the new Factory Act of 
1901 numerous instances are recorded of "time-cribbing." 
A factory inspector at Manchester reports : " The majority 
of firms always run from I J to 2.\ minutes beyond the 
legal times, and for this small amount it is almost im- 
possible to take any action. It is only when cribbing 
exceeds 2j minutes that the inspector feels on sure ground. 
Yet the habitual cribbing of only two minutes at each 
starting and stopping time represents a clear gain of a 
week per year." l He concludes that heavier penalties 
for infringement might act as a deterrent. An inspector 
1 Ann. Rep. Chief Inspector of Factories, 1902, p. 118. 



122 INFANT MORTALITY 

at Oldham writes : " ' Time-cribbing ' shows no sign of 
cessation or even of diminishing. Nearly all cotton mills 
crib time of from 2 to 10 minutes in each meal-time. 
Offenders readily pay the fines imposed upon them ; these 
are generally very light, and utterly inadequate to reduce 
the frequency of the offence." I 

The case of a laundry in Liverpool is recorded in the 
same report (where women were employed) which was 
working 82^ hours per week, exclusive of meal-times. In 
the report of the following year (1903) a number of par- 
ticulars are given of the way in which legal overtime or 
illegal " time-cribbing " occurred. 2 In 1904, in a large 
factory laundry a woman was found to have been em- 
ployed ?6f hours in the week, and a girl of seventeen 68J 
hours, exclusive of meal-times.3 And many other similar 
instances could be quoted. Since the passing of the 
Factory Act of 1901, that is to say, during the three years 
1902-4, 713 complaints as to illegal hours have been 
received at the Home Office, and 343 cases have been 
upheld, and report is made that " the abuse known as 
' time-cribbing ' is still prevalent in the north-western 
division, often with the connivance of the operatives." 
The practice does not prevail in Scotland. 

But we may take it that these are the exceptions, and 
in most places it would appear that any serious degree of 
" time-cribbing " is now a thing of the past.4

the Times (February, 1906) : 

'" TIME-CRIBBING ' IN LANCASHIRE MILLS. 

" Acting on behalf of the Home Secretary (who was detained in the 
House of Commons), Mr. Herbert Samuel, the Under-Secretary, received 
a deputation yesterday from the United Textile Factory Workers' Asso- 
ciation, who complained of ' time-cribbing ' in Lancashire cotton mills. 

" Mr. Shackleton, M.P., introduced the deputation, and the spokesmen 
were Mr. J. Crinion, president of the Amalgamated Society of Card Room 
Operatives, and Mr. W. Marsland, representing the cotton spinners. It

III. EMPLOYMENT BEFORE AND AFTER CHILDBIRTH. 

In the Factory Act of 1891 (S. 17) and in the Act of 
1901 (S. 61) the law lays down a standard as to the employ- 
ment of women after childbirth in the following words : 
"S. 61. An occupier of a factory or workshop shall 
not knowingly allow a woman or girl to be 
employed therein within four weeks after she 
has given birth to a child." 1 

was stated that many employers in Lancashire kept their factories at 
work at least two or three hours per week beyond the legal time to their 
own profit, but to the loss of the operatives, who were employed upon the 
day-work system. The comparatively small fines inflicted upon 
employers had no deterrent effect. 

" Mr. Herbert Samuel in reply, said the matter had already been brought 
before the Home Secretary by a Trade Union deputation, who approached 
him on a number of labour questions, and received a very sympathetic 
reply. Undoubtedly ' time-cribbing ' was notorious in the textile districts, 
and it had long been known to the Home Office. Whatever could be 
done ought to be done and would be done to stop the practice. The 
factory inspectors for some time past had been giving constant and close 
attention to it, and between July and October last there were thirty-six 
prosecutions with thirty-four convictions. Nevertheless, the practice con- 
tinued unchecked, and for two reasons. One was the difficulty of securing 
evidence, and the other was the inadequacy of the penalty. It actually 
paid an employer habitually to crib time and run the risk of being called 
on to pay a comparatively small fine. It had been suggested that a remedy 
might be found in an increase in the number of factory inspectors. 
Undoubtedly the factory inspectorate was understaffed, but Mr. Gladstone 
hoped to increase the number of inspectors of various classes. Another 
suggestion was that there should be a cumulative fine, or that the maximum 
fine should be made the minimum. That was done now in some cases, 
and the question of whether the principle could be extended would be 
carefully considered. The suggestion that the law could be more 
efficiently administered if the services of the police were requisitioned 
was one with which personally he had considerable sympathy. It would, 
however, require legislation, and when Parliament would be able to deal 
with amendments in the Factory Acts he could not say." 

1 Similar legislation exists in Belgium, Holland, Denmark, and Austria. 
In Germany the four weeks must be extended to six, unless a medical 
certificate is furnished approving of employment at the end of four weeks. 
In Spain the period of prohibited work is three weeks, and the employer 
must allow one hour at least in the ordinary period of employment to 
nursing mothers to nurse their children. There must be no deduction of 
wages for this hour, which may be divided into two separate half-hours. 
In Switzerland a total absence from employment in factories of women 
during eight weeks before and after childbirth must be observed, and on 
their return to work proof must be tendered of an absence since the birth 
of the child of at least six weeks. Oliver's Dangerous Trades, 1902, 
PP. 53-54-

INFANT MORTALITY 



It will thus be seen that no legal offence has arisen 
unless the occupier has employed or re-employed the 
mother of a child knowing that she has given birth to a 
child within four weeks. Further, no responsibility is laid 
upon the mother or father of the child, no means are 
prescribed by which the employer may find out the fact of 
the birth or its date, and up to the present it appears that 
no action can be taken to prove " knowledge " against 
a limited liability company. Hence it has come about 
that although the prohibition is well known in factory 
districts it remains more or less a dead letter, the spirit of 
the law in any event being broken. Since 1901 the 
Home Office has received 27 informations of infringement 
of S. 6 1, of which 24 proved to be genuine. But this is no 
guide as to the degree of infringement, nor is it, of course, 
concerned with the time of leaving off work before con- 
finement, which is also a matter of great importance. 
Miss Squire, one of H.M. Lady Inspectors of Factories, 
made an inquiry into the time of leaving off work before, 
and of resuming after, confinement in 124 women em- 
ployed in cotton mills in Preston, with the following 
result :

Two of the medical men with whom Miss Squire con- 
ferred in Preston attributed the large number of pre- 
mature births to continued work in the mill during 
pregnancy, and all considered that an exceptional number 
of cases of uterine trouble existed and was attributable to

too early return to work. 1 A special sub-committee of the 
Corporation of Preston arrived at much the same con- 
clusion two years earlier, and in particular laid emphasis 
upon the grave injury following " the return of the mother 
to her work within a short period after confinement." 2 
In Longton and Hanley, in the Potteries, the usual 
practice is to continue work until within a few weeks of 
childbirth, and most of the women return to work six 
weeks or longer after childbirth, though nearly all of 
them do their housework at the end of two weeks.3 In 
Dundee, out of an inquiry involving 267 mothers of young 
children, six returned within four weeks of childbirth. 
The average absence before confinement is a month or 
more.4 

Another inquiry in the same town showed that 13 
out of no mothers had returned to work within the 
month. s In Paisley, as we have seen, there is probably 
very little infringement. 

A hint in the above paragraph suggests that in the 
event of the mother's work being at home, employment 
would commence at an earlier date after childbirth than if 
the mother was occupied in a factory. Section 61 has, of 
course, no application to home-workers, and yet there are 
an immense number of such persons, most of whom are 
women (in Finsbury 86 per cent.) and a high percentage 
of whom are married. 

The result is that the limit of time of return to work 
laid down in S. 61. is disregarded by home-workers. 6

6 The following typical cases, which occurred in Central London, may 
be cited '. 

(a) Mrs. H., blouse and children's costume machinist, at home, has three 
children, the youngest 2j, two very delicate. After confinement she has 
usually begun her blouse work again at the end of a fortnight. But a year 
ago after a premature confinement (the baby died immediately after birth), 



126 INFANT MORTALITY 

In home-workers, as in others, the cause of the early 
return to work is almost invariably poverty. 

The limit of four weeks is almost universally recognised 
as the least restriction that is compatible with the health 
of the mother, and far less than most authorities would 
consider needful or desirable in the interests of the child. 
Further, it should be added that the need for restriction is 
" on medical testimony in the textile districts greater than 
in any other owing to the greater strain and more trying 
conditions of work." * 

IV. SANITATION OF FACTORIES AND WORKSHOPS. 

The health conditions for which legislation is provided 
in the Factory and Workshop Act of 1901 are cleanliness, 
freedom from effluvia, the avoidance of overcrowding, 
sufficient ventilation, the drainage of floors, and the 
provision of sanitary conveniences. 2 The principles of 
sanitation applicable to dwelling-houses also apply broadly 
of course to factories and workshops, and it is therefore 

as her husband had been out of work, she could not afford to lie up at all. 
The baby was born between 6 and 7 a.m., and before midday of the same 
day she was sitting at her sewing-machine blouse-making. She is now 
again expecting her confinement. She always machines straight on up to 
the time of her confinement. 

(b) Mrs. B., a young woman, and her husband work at home in the 
finishing of nursery boots. They have had two children, both now 
dead ; one died at thirteen days, the other at eight months. The birth of 
the first baby was premature ; the second, very delicate, was born while 
Mrs. B. was suffering from pneumonia. The doctor thought she got 
pneumonia because she so often got wet in " going to the shop." Her 
husband worked for two shops, and "to get a living at all " he had to 
work straight on ; he could not spare time to fetch and carry the work 
backwards and forwards. So she had to do it and she often got very wet. 
Her share of the work was to make holes in the boot heels. She resumed 
her employment fourteen days after each baby was born. 

(c) Mrs. D. is a boot machinist. Her husband is a painter and often 
short of work. Since her marriage she has done boot machining at 
home. She has lost five out of nine children ; one was still-born. She 
usually machines till within a month of confinement, and resumes work 
about three weeks afterwards. Ann. Rep. of Chief Inspector of Factories, 
1904, p. 275.

unnecessary to dwell at length either upon the necessity for 
and means of sanitation or the evil results arising from 
neglect in these respects. Cleanliness, fresh air, and 
freedom from insanitation are as necessary in a factory 
as in a home. It may, however, be convenient to state 
in respect of overcrowding that not less than 250, or 
during any period of overtime, 400 cubic feet of space 
must be provided for each person, and this standard is 
now enforced. I Somewhat more extended reference is 
necessary to ventilation and the supply of sanitary 
conveniences. 

Ventilation in the proper sense, that is supply of fresh 
air as distinguished from mere air space, was not required 
under former Factory Acts, but this omission has been 
remedied in the Act of 1901 (S. 7), and any standard fixed 
by the Home Secretary must now be observed. 2 In general 
it is found that 3,000 cubic feet of fresh air per head per 
hour, if uniformly diffused, ;will keep the respiratory 
carbonic acid gas down to the limit of 6 parts per 10,000. 3 
There is comparatively little evidence to show that the 
presence of CO 2 in atmosphere is itself directly injurious, 
and it is not used as a standard on that account, but for 
the reason that it serves as an available and convenient 
index of the exhaustion of the air. But though specific 
disease cannot be directly traced to the inhalation of 
stagnant air containing, say, upwards of 12 parts of CO 2 
per 1,000, it cannot be doubted that such reduced air, in 
some degree deoxidised, exhausted, and containing organic 
impurity, does exert an injurious effect upon persons work- 

1 In certain special industries, e.g., in match factories in which yellow 
phosphorus is used, the ordinary minimum is 400 cubic feet. 

* A limit of 9 vols. of CO, per 10,000 in humid cotton cloth factories, and 
600 cubic feet of fresh air per head per hour in other humid textile 
factories ; CO 2 in ordinary factories and workshops should not exceed 
12 parts per 10,000. 

3 For an explicit statement on this subject see Ann. Rep. of Chief 
Inspector of Factories, 1902, pp. vii-x. 



128 INFANT MORTALITY 

ing in it and spending many hours daily breathing it. 
Nor can it be doubted that this general proposition finds 
abundant confirmation in factories and workshops where 
women are employed. Haldane and Osborn found more 
often than not that the amount of CO 2 present in the air 
of such places was much above the permissible degree of 
impurity (6 per 10,000). Taking the standard of outside 
air as containing 3*5 parts of CO 2 per 10,000, they found 
the amount of CO 2 in the air of workshops in which 
women were employed to vary considerably. In tailoring 
workshops the CO 2 varied from 3'2 parts per 10,000 (*>., 
even purer than fresh-air standard) to 53*2 parts ; in collar 
factories, from I3'3 to 38*6 ; in dressmaking workrooms, 
from 5 - o to 26 - 6 ; in laundries, from 3*6 to 8'2 ; in book- 
binding workrooms, from 3*5 to 257 ; in textile factories 
(non-humid), from 3*2 to 47-0 ; in humid textiles, from 
3*5 to 32 - o; and in cotton-spinning, from 3*5 parts to 56'6 
parts of CO 2 per 10,000. In tailoring and other industries 
under Jewish control the air was much fresher than in 
similar industries under English control. J 

These figures leave us in no uncertainty as to the wide 
prevalence of atmospheres in factories and workshops 
which are so stagnant, stuffy, and "close" that they cannot 
but exert an injurious physical influence on women work- 
ing in them. In point of fact it is a matter of common 
knowledge that the breathing of such atmospheres for 
lengthened periods is one of the conditions which results, 
in the long run, in actual disease. * Local ventilation 
for the removal of dust, gases, vapours, and other im- 
purities generated in the course of work, which are a 
nuisance or injurious to health, must be such as will

and Workshops, 1902 (Appendices).

render them harmless as far as possible. Usually this 
involves exhaust ventilation applied at or near the point 
of origin, or other means such as fans, draft chambers, 
respirators, and for dust wet processes. The temperature 
must be regulated in every workroom of a factory or 
workshop, and humidity must be regulated in humid 
textile factories. 

The standard as to sanitary conveniences is laid down 
in the Factory Act, 1901,* and determined and interpreted 
by special Order of the Home Secretary. The Sanitary 
Accommodation Order came into force in July, 1903, and 
lays down that " where females are employed, or in attend- 
ance, there shall be one sanitary convenience for every 25 
females," properly and suitably separated and appointed. 

The public do not yet recognise how grave may be 
the physical results of a failure properly to exercise the 
physiological functions of the kidneys and bowels. Such 
results are not, it is true, manifested in a way which 
permits of clear statement, and the effects may not 
become evident for months, or even years. But they are 
none the less existent. A failure to rid the body promptly 
and regularly of the excretal products of animal metabo- 
lism may lead not only to habitual constipation, but 
to diseased conditions of the blood, may predispose to 
constitutional diseases, and may be the original cause of 
disease and misplacement of internal organs. There can 
be little doubt that much of the widespread anaemia and 
chlorosis among factory women and girls arises from 
absorption into the blood of retained by-products in the 
alimentary canal, and it is a well-recognised fact that 

1 Sec. 9 (i). " Every factory and workshop must be provided with 
sufficient and suitable accommodation in the way of sanitary conveni- 
ences, regard being had to the number of persons employed in, or in 
attendance at, the factory or workshop ; and also where persons of both 
sexes are, or are intended to be. employed or in attendance, with proper 
separate accommodation for persons of each sex," 
K 



130 INFANT MORTALITY 

headache and conditions of lassitude and debility fre- 
quently arise from a similar origin. From these facts it is 
clear that ample accommodation should be provided, not 
only for actual usage, but such that there may be no 
undue deterrence or postponement of the exercise of these 
functions. A standard must therefore be adopted which 
will in no way and under no passing circumstances of 
ill-health allow of insufficient provision. Under the 
Sanitary Act of 1866 the local authority was required 
to make regulations in this respect for tenement-houses, 
and from that time to 1901 factories were treated in a 
somewhat similar way. In the latter year, however, the 
new Act furnished a definite standard for all workplaces, 
and though the condition of things has been bad in the 
extreme in the past, there is now evidence to show great 
improvement. 

In 1902 the Blackburn mills were found to be sadly 
lacking in adequate sanitary accommodation, only one 
sanitary convenience on an average being provided for 
40 women, compared with one for 26 in similar mills in 
the same part of the country. In Preston 28 out of 53 
cotton factories were found with insufficient and unsuitable 
accommodation. Many of the arrangements provided 
were insanitary. 1 In 1903 the factory inspector for South 
Wales reported fourteen factories and workshops without 
any sanitary accommodation whatever. 

During 1903-4 a systematic survey of every cotton mill 
in the north-west division of the country yielded defective 
or insufficient sanitary accommodation as follows : In 
Manchester, 25 per cent, of the factories visited ; in 
Salford, 29 per cent. ; in Failsworth, 25 ; in the country 
districts of Swinton and Walkden the percentages were 
33 and 66 respectively ; in Oldham, 47 ; in Ashton, 25 ; in 
Mossley, 50 ; in Shaw, 25 ; in Rochdale, 42 ; and in Hey-

wood, 64. x In many of the Staffordshire pottery towns a 
high percentage of unsuitable, insufficient, or insanitary 
conveniences also occur. It cannot be doubted that there 
has been great improvement in respect of this matter of 
sanitary accommodation in recent years, but there is still 
much to be done in the direction of more suitable pro- 
vision. 2 

CONCLUSIONS. 

We had previously seen that town life is disadvan- 
tageous to the health and life of infants. That is a 
commonplace and obvious fact. But after the present 
chapter we must now add that in towns where women 
are largely employed in factories, away from home, the 
disadvantages are enormously increased. Broadly, that is 
the inevitable conclusion. There are reservations and 
differences, but the fact remains. And the operations of 
this fact are threefold. First, there are the ordinary 
injuries and diseases to which women and girls in fac- 
tories are liable ; secondly, there is the strain and stress 
of long hours and hard work to the pregnant woman ; 
and thirdly, there is the absence from home of the mother 
of the infant. It cannot be doubted that these are the 
factors in the relation between factory occupation of 
women and a high infant mortality. 

The direct injuries to women and girls employed in 
factories and workshops are (a) accidents from machinery, 
materials, and other external agents ; () injury or poison- 
ing from toxic substances, or injury from excessive dust, 
fumes, vapour, or extremes of temperature, such as 
anthrax in horse-hair factories, tetanus in jute works, 
lung diseases in dusty trades, and abortion in lead works ; 
(c) injury through fatigue and strain, long hours, insuffi-

132 INFANT MORTALITY 

cient periods of rest for food, as in some clothing and 
dress factories, or the carrying of heavy weights, as in 
brick-making, &c. ; (cT) injury derived from defective 
sanitary conditions, such as ill-ventilation, dampness, or 
an insufficiency or unsuitability of sanitary conveniences ; 
and (e) too short a period of rest at the time of child- 
birth. Over and over again in the official reports of 
factory inspectors or medical officers of health does one 
meet with evidences of these injuries. Where the con- 
ditions resulting in these evils, coupled with the absence 
of the mother from home, are present, the infant mortality 
is high ; where they are not present it is usually low. 
The Medical Officer of Health of Kearsley (J. C. Eames, 
M.D.), a town in Lancashire of 9,500 population, puts the 
matter in a nutshell in his annual report for 1904. He 
began his official study of the health of the town in 1885, 
and in his report he animadverts upon the changes which 
twenty years have brought. 

" On looking back some remarkable changes are shown. We 
had then a population of 7,250, against our present 9,500. The 
death rates were about the same [18*0 per 1,000], but our birth 
rate has fallen from 39 to 27, there being no less than 286 births 
in 1885, against 257 last year. Our death rate of children under 
i shows even more striking figures, it being then 143, and much 
the same for several years, against our present 229. 

" Undoubtedly during the twenty years much good sanitary 
work has been done and improvements made, and these have 
helped to keep down our general death rate. How, then, account 
for our very high infant mortality ? It really looks as if people 
were less anxious to have families, and took less care of any they 
had. In the old times children were welcomed as likely soon to 
be a help to their parents ; now, in spite of free education, it is 
felt that beginning work so much later, and being so much more 
independent (is this a result of education ?), they will no sooner 
be able to earn something than they will want to set up for them- 
selves. We have developed into more of a manufacturing district ',

and future mothers are tempted to remain in the mill too near to 
their confinement^ and thus not be in a state to bear healthy children. 
Again, they return to the mill too soon offer, thus leaving their 
children to other? care. This, of course, entails artificial feeding, 
which can never be as beneficial as natural, and is often simply 
poisonous. This improper feeding is generally due to ignorance, 
which also accounts for the errors made in clothing, and the 
cleanliness of the child and its surroundings." 

Dr. Eames, addressing his authority, adds : " On the 
whole, I can safely congratulate you on the changes made 
since 1885 in the sanitary condition of the district. If 
these changes have not resulted in diminishing the death 
rate [of infants], that is because other evils have increased, 
and steps must now be taken to put them down also." * 
For ten years the infant mortality has been steadily 
increasing at Kearsley. In 1894-1903 it was 179 (the 
general death rate being 17 per 1,000), in 1903 it rose 
to 192, and in 1904 to 229, 'as much as 34 per cent, of 
the infant deaths being due to prematurity and im- 
maturity, and this change is attributed by the medical 
officer to the town having "developed into more of a 
manufacturing district." 

In Preston the infant mortality rates and the general 
death rates since 1881 have been as follows:

134 INFANT MORTALITY 

In consequence of the fact that while there has been a 
steady and continuous decline in the general mortality of 
Preston during the past thirty years, the infant mortality 
has shown an increase, a sub-committee was appointed to 
inquire into the causes, and after careful consideration of 
the question and the examination of numerous witnesses 
having special facilities for correct observation, it sub- 
mitted certain conclusions : 

1. "First among these causes is the employment of female 
labour in mills. An occupation requiring a woman to stand 
during the greater part of the day when continued up to within 
a few days or even hours of the time of parturition, must act to 
the detriment of the offspring, and there is less chance of the 
latter coming into the world fully grown, well formed, and in 
good health. Many deaths taking place during the first month 
which are returned as due to premature birth, immaturity, con- 
genital debility, convulsions, and the like, may safely be ascribed 
to this cause. 

2. " Again, the return of the mother to her work within a short 
period after confinement, thus depriving the infant of a mother's 
care and of the sustenance which nature intended for it, consti- 
tutes a still greater evil. With this is connected the nursing out 
of infants, which exposes them to violent and sudden changes of 
temperature during their removal night and morning through the 
cold air of the streets. Some mothers are compelled to resume 
work as early as possible, as they are the main support of the 
families, but there is a marked disinclination on the part of many 
young mothers to stay at home and tend their children, preferring 
as they do the life at the mill to that of nursing. 

3. " But a third and more important cause consists in the 
very habits of the operative classes themselves, in their ignorance 
of the first laws of health, and in their blind adherence to 
customs which have long since been deservedly condemned. 
There are few people with less knowledge or experience of 
household duties than the ordinary factory girl, and as a conse- 
quence when she becomes a wife and a mother, knowing little of 
the duties required of her, she is content, as regards the manage- 



THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN 135 

ment of her children, to follow the example of her parents and 
the customs of those amongst whom she lives. Accustomed to 
a heated atmosphere, the factory operative above all things fears 
a draught, and so the bedroom doors, windows, and fireplaces 
are kept closed ; thus the air soon becomes foul and poisonous, 
and in this way the seeds of tubercular and scrofulous disease 
are engendered and transmitted from one member of the family 
to another. 

4. "A high mortality is also met with among children of 
mothers who have children in quick succession, as also of 
mothers (e.g, small shopkeepers) who are very actively employed 
for many hours each day. 

5. " Unwholesome food and the want of cleanliness in its 
preparation and administration are the direct causes of many 
infantile deaths. Bread and starchy preparations are substituted 
for milk, and where the latter is given, the feeding-bottle from its 
dirty condition is frequently a source of danger to the infant. 
After the first week or two, proper and systematic washing of 
the infant is less and less frequently done, fresh air and sunlight 
are not recognised as necessities, and altogether there is an 
absence of proper nursing, a word pregnant with meaning as 
applied to infant life. 

6. " Among the causes may be mentioned ' insurance,' by 
which the death of a child brings a monetary gain to the parents ; 
the habit of allowing very young children to sleep in the same 
bed with the parents, resulting in deaths from suffocation, or 
overlaying; and the use of sleeping stuffs to quiet a fractious 
child or to ensure a good night's sleep. 

7. " Of causes which are more especially associated with the 
increase in the infantile mortality may be named: (a) The 
diminished stamina of the parents. In Preston, as in the older 
manufacturing towns, where there is little importation of fresh 
blood, there is a risk in the intermarriages (often at an early age) 
amongst persons of the same class, and a danger of the offspring 
becoming more and more enfeebled, (b) The increasing use of 
means to prevent conception or procure abortion, which, if 
unsuccessful, must have a prejudicial effect on the health of the 
child, (c) The alarming increase in the consumption, by young 
women and mothers, of alcoholic beverages, exercising a baneful 



136 INFANT MORTALITY 

effect on the constitution of the child before birth, but more 
especially leading to carelessness and neglect of the child after 
birth, and at that period of its life when care and attention are 
most needed. 

" These, then, are the causes which sometimes separately, but 
more frequently in combination, lead to the heavy infantile 
death rate in Preston." x 

These two extracts from the records of Lancashire 
towns not only lay emphasis upon the fact that the 
occupation of women away from home plays a part in the 
causation of infant mortality, but they illustrate, in concise 
form, the ways in which this factor operates. 

In a general way it may be said that it is the employ- 
ment of women from girlhood, all through married life, 
and through the period of child-bearing the continual 
stress and strain of the work and hours and general con- 
ditions prevailing in women's labour that is exerting its 
baneful influence on the individual and on the home. 
And it is necessary to view the matter in this way to 
escape its fallacies. Statistical returns do not entirely 
support the assertion that factory employment of women 
is the main cause of high infant mortality. Statistics are 
useful to guide us as to the general tendency, but it is 
their actual meaning in terms of social life and custom 
which should form our conclusions in the matter. To 
take a single example, it has been alleged that factory 
employment of women is the only cause of the heavy 
incidence of fatality from premature births. No doubt it 
bears a relation, but the fact is that prematurity is more a 
cause of infant death in districts where there are no 
factories than where there are. It is admitted that pre- 
maturity and immaturity is the chief cause of death in 
infants in the first trimester of their life. Is it not then a 

1 Report on Health of Preston, 1902, pp. 10-12. 



THE OCCUPATION OF WOMEN 137 

strange fact that only 47*6 per cent, of the infant deaths 
in Lancashire occur within the first three months of life, 
whereas in the three counties where there is least factory 
employment of women and the lowest infant mortality 
(Westmoreland, Dorset, and Wiltshire), the percentage of 
deaths in the first three months is 61 (or 34 per cent, 
higher) ? Or again, in Preston and Blackburn the em- 
ployment of women has been declining since the census of 
1891, but the infant mortality has been increasing. Or 
once more, in the Durham coalfield and in South Wales, 
districts in which women are not much engaged in indus- 
trial occupations, infant mortality has been increasing 
since the middle of last century, and now stands among 
the highest rates, whereas in the West Riding of York- 
shire, where women are much employed in the mills, the 
infant mortality has been declining within the same 
period. 

The fact is, as I have pointed out, that something much 
more than mere percentage occupation of women is 
required to guide us. We need to know the percentage 
occupation of married women at child-bearing ages, and 
when we have secured that we need to give the facts a 
wide connotation. No doubt the factory plays a part, but 
the home plays a vastly greater part, in the causation 01 
infant mortality in the towns where women are employed 
at the mills. There are two influences at work : first, the 
direct injury to the physique and character of the indi- 
vidual caused by much of the factory employment of 
women ; and secondly, the indirect and reflex injury to the 
home and social life of the worker. We cannot afford to 
forget either of these points in attempting to estimate the 
operations of the factory in infant mortality. It is because 
they have not been sufficiently correlated together that 
fallacy has arisen in the past But even yet we have not 
finished. " Infantile mortality in Lancashire," writes an 



138 INFANT MORTALITY 

experienced medical officer of health for a town in that 
county with an infant mortality in 1904 of 222, " is, I am 
sorry to say, as much a financial as a hygienic question." 
Why do married women work in the mills ? is the ques- 
tion this medical officer has reached. His answer is that 
" A weaver's wages will not allow of the wife's remaining 
at home, considering the high rents and rates, and so both 
go which is the rule and a hand-to-mouth existence 
results even for themselves, let alone the little ones, who 
are left in the intervals to the mercies of the nurse, who, 
as a rule, takes in the babies to eke out her own husband's 
wages. Much good may be done by hygienic tuition, but 
I am certain that the root of the whole matter with us is, 
as I have said, comparatively low wages and high rents 
and rates." And then at the end of his letter he adds : 
" The great trouble in dealing with this question [of infant 
mortality] from a hygienic point of view is caused, as in 
most social problems, by the people themselves." It is 
the old story of a vicious circle. 



VI 

EPIDEMIC DIARRHCEA 

T7PIDEMIC diarrhoea (zymotic or epidemic enteritis] 
I v may be defined as an acute infective disease affect- 
ing chiefly children under two years of age, occurring 
during the summer months in epidemic form, and charac- 
terised as a rule by the occurrence of diarrhoea, vomiting, 
convulsive phenomena, and wasting, accompanied in severe 
cases by toxaemia and collapse. About 7$ per cent, of the 
total registered deaths in England and Wales from this 
disease occur in children under one year of age, and about 
78 per cent, in London and other large towns. We have 
already seen that this disease is not only one of the most 
fatal of all the diseases of infancy, but that it is increasing 
in prevalence. It is, indeed, the typical condition to which 
urban infant mortality is due, and therefore it calls for 
somewhat full treatment. 

Pathology and Clinical Character of Diarrhoea. 
General. The facts seem to show that, although the 
specific cause, if sufficiently potent, may operate generally 
throughout the system with the suddenness of the action 
of a virulent chemical poison, the disease usually first 
shows its presence in the body by more or less general, 
and sometimes only comparatively slight, disturbance of 
the nervous and vascular systems ; as a rule, other parts 

139 



140 INFANT MORTALITY 

of the body are disturbed before the gastro-intestinal 
system. It should be added that the length of the attack 
before death or recovery varies from a few hours to six or 
eight weeks. Ballard found a majority of fatal cases 
terminated between the fourth and fourteenth day. 1 

The following are the leading phenomena which, in vary- 
ing degree and with varying certainty, are observed in the 
course of the disease as ordinarily met with : Diarrhoea, 
vomiting, convulsive phenomena, a bodily temperature 
sometimes above sometimes below the normal, reduction 
in quantity or actual suppression of urine, embarrassed 
breathing, and, as a rule, physical indications of pul- 
monary inflammation, pallor of surface of the body, loss 
of flesh, and exhaustion with its various well-known 
clinical features. Occasionally there is jaundice, and 
now and then a fugitive rash occurs. 

Diarrhcea. Ballard believed that this malady usually 
characterised by diarrhoea may run its course from first to 
last, and even to death, without any diarrhoea at all. In 
other cases, although diarrhoea occurs, it is by no means 
the prominent symptom ; it may be comparatively of 
trifling amount or of short duration. More frequently, 
however, it is the prominent symptom, thus giving the 
malady its name, lasting throughout the illness, or only 
disappearing shortly before death. It may be intermittent 
or remittent. The quantity and daily frequency of the 
diarrhceal discharge vary, but in very sharp and acute 
cases, or towards the termination of more prolonged cases, 
bowel discharges may be incessant and abundant. In 
prolonged cases a change from diarrhoea moderate in 
quantity and frequency to a diarrhoea of this last- 
mentioned sort may take place very suddenly. It is not 

1 Dr. Ballard's classical researches were published in part as a Supple- 
ment to the Report of the Medical Officer of the Local Government Board, 
1887. 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHCEA 141 

uncommon for the diarrhoeal discharge to cease some 
hours and even some days before death. There is 
nothing essential about the colour of the stools ; they may 
be decidedly mucous or watery, or, on the other hand, 
lumpy and cheesy. For the most part the stools are 
offensive, but not invariably. If not offensive at first, 
they are apt to become so as the diarrhoea proceeds or 
the fatal illness approaches its termination. A description 
which has been given of the odour is " horrible and death- 
like." In some cases the stools are stained with blood. 

Vomiting. In only 10 or 20 per cent, of cases is 
vomiting absent altogether throughout the course of the 
illness. In the vast majority of cases the vomiting occurs 
concurrently with the commencement of the diarrhoea, or, 
if not concurrently, within a few hours. Occasionally it 
stands alone, perhaps for a whole day, as the prominent 
feature of the attack, the diarrhoea not appearing until the 
second day of the illness. As a rule, the shorter and 
sharper the illness, the earlier in its course does vomiting 
appear. Once it occurs it usually recurs from time to time 
until the termination of the case. In about a third or 
fourth of the cases, however, it ceases in the course of the 
first day's illness, and does not recur. In still fewer 
instances it only ceases, like the diarrhoea, shortly before 
death. Occasionally, in cases of over a week's duration, 
diarrhoea and vomiting have alternated as the prominent 
symptoms of gastro-intestinal disturbance. It varies in 
severity, occasionally being the prominent symptom from 
first to last, and now and then is so severe as to be 
apparently the principal cause of the fatal prostration. 
Its association with the diarrhoea has led to the familiar 
hospital formula of " D. and V." 

Convulsions. Only a small percentage of fatal cases 
run their course without presenting convulsions of some 
kind. Mostly they consist of the ordinary well-known 



142 INFANT MORTALITY 

"fits" of infants, but in about a fifth of the cases they 
consist of such minor phenomena as clenching or " work- 
ing " of the hands, rolling of the head and eyes, twitchings 
of the limbs, " sawing the air " with the arms, or " inward 
convulsions," such phenomena being mostly observed 
towards the close of the illness. Convulsions, however, 
may occur quite early in the illness ; sometimes even they 
occur on the first day of the illness, accompanying the 
commencement of the diarrhoea. After this they may not 
recur, or, on the other hand, they may recur from time to 
time during the whole illness, and be even its most 
prominent feature, sometimes appearing to take the place 
of the vomiting. There is no apparently necessary con- 
nection, however, between convulsions and the symptom 
diarrhoea, for the convulsions occur sometimes when the 
diarrhoea has throughout been moderate in amount. The 
occurrence of convulsions may indicate the onset of 
uraemia. The comatose condition in which the patient 
often dies appears as a rule to be due to the same con- 
dition of the blood ; but in some cases evidences of 
intra-cranial inflammation have been observed. 

Bodily Temperature. At the commencement there 
appears to be slight febrile disturbance, but sooner or 
later, in the cases about to become fatal, the temperature 
falls more or less below the normal range, being lower in 
the morning than in the evening, and even then it mostly 
fails to attain a normal standard. Towards the end of a 
fatal case the temperature is apt to rise. In cases of very 
short duration, where the child is rapidly prostrated with 
deluging watery stools, the temperature falls rapidly, and 
the child may die in collapse. The quantity of urine 
voided is naturally reduced by the diarrhoea. Actual 
suppression occurs towards the close of some cases. The 
kidney is usually implicated quite as early as the intestine, 
with lesions quite as severe. 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHOEA 143 

Age Incidence. Finally, a word must be said as to age 
incidence. The chief incidence of attack is upon children 
under five years of age, and particularly those under two 
years. After five years the disease rapidly declines, and 
occurs least between the ages of five and twenty-five, after 
which it gradually increases. On infants under one year 
of age the incidence is small under three months, after which 
age it definitely increases up to a varying time between 
the first and second years. Probably the chief fatality is 
in the second and third trimesters of the first year. 1 
Infants die almost indifferently whether the attack be 
sudden and acute or slow and protracted, whereas in 
children above one year death seldom occurs unless the 
attack be virulent. Dr. Bruce Low pointed out in 1887 
that the disease was not infrequently communicated from 
person to person by direct infection, multiple cases thus 
occurring. 

" Diarrhoea," wrote Ballard, " is a malady always present 
in a lesser or greater degree," at all seasons of the year, 
cases being often quite as acute and rapidly fatal as in the 
late summer. There is no week in the year in which 
deaths from diarrhoea are not recorded by the Registrar- 
General. But in the summer the disease is so common as 
to constitute an epidemic of yearly occurrence. Excessive 
prevalence in the summer, above the average epidemicity, 
largely affects persons over five years of age, and, as a rule 
least of all infants. It is least prevalent in the first quarter 
of the year, next in the fourth quarter, more prevalent 
in the second, and most prevalent in the third quarter. 
Lastly, the disease attacks almost as many healthy infants 
as weakly ones. It is not the case that it only attacks 
weakly infants. 

1 In 1904, in the six typical towns Birmingham, Manchester, Oldham, 
Blackburn, Brighton, and the Metropolitan Borough of Finsbury 37 per 
cent, of the infantile mortality from diarrhoea fell on infants in the second 
trimester of their first year. 



144 INFANT MORTALITY 

The Cause of Epidemic Diarrhoea, 

From what has preceded it is obvious that epidemic 
diarrhoea is a general disease of a specific character 
within wide variations. 

Some writers speak of the disease as catarrhal rather 
than infective (the two forms are not very definite, and 
it is possible that the latter is an aggravated type of 
the former), but there is increasing evidence as to its 
infectivity, and this must be briefly considered, even 
though the exact cause of the disease is not at present 
known. In 1887 Ballard formulated certain propositions, 
" as a working hypothesis that would best accord with the 
totality of the evidence" in his possession, which still 
serve as a basis for future inquiry. They were as 
follows : 

" That the essential cause of diarrhoea resides ordinarily 
in the superficial layers of the earth, where it is intimately 
associated with the life processes of some micro-organism 
not yet detected, captured, or isolated. 

" That the vital manifestations of such organism are 
dependent, among other things, perhaps principally upon 
conditions of season and on the presence of dead organic 
matter which is its pabulum. 

"That on occasion such micro-organism is capable of 
getting abroad from its primary habitat, the earth, and 
having become air-borne, obtains opportunity for fastening 
on non-living organic material, and of using such organic 
material both as nidus and as pabulum in undergoing 
various phases of its life history. 

"That in food, inside of as well as outside of the 
human body, such micro-organism finds, especially at 
certain seasons, nidus and pabulum convenient for its 
development, multiplication, or evolution. 

" That from food, as also from the contained organic 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHCEA 145 

matter of particular soils, such micro-organism can manu- 
facture by the chemical changes wrought therein through 
certain of its life processes, a substance which is a virulent 
chemical poison ; and that this chemical substance is, in the 
human body, the material cause of epidemic diarrhoea." * 

Bacteriology of Diarrhoea. The three causal agents which 
Ballard mentions as playing a large part in the production of 
this disease are the soil, season, and food and the causa 
causans is " some micro-organism not yet detected or isolated." 
It must be said that we have not got much further than this 
during the last twenty years. 

In 1885, Escherich published his classical researches on B. coli 
communis. He pointed out that the excreta (meconiuni) of the 
newly-born infant is free from bacteria, but by the second day 
they are present in large numbers, and in the ordinary excreta of 
healthy infants he found chiefly two organisms, B. lactis arogenes 
and B, coli communis. Of these the former was the more 
abundant in the upper part of the small intestine, and the 
latter in the lower part and in the' colon, so that in the excreta 
B. coli was abundant and B. lactis comparatively scarce. Booker, 
working in 1886, subsequently found that the constant bac- 
teria of the healthy excreta of the infant (B. coli and B. lactis 
arogenes} do not disappear in the excreta of diarrhoea. B. coli, 
however, does not predominate in the same degree, and B. lactis 
is present generally in greater numbers than in the healthy 
excreta. Booker examined the excreta of thirty-one children, 
and isolated thirty-three different species of bacteria. The actual 
number of bacteria was, he found, as great in healthy excreta as 
in diarrho3al excreta. Proteus vulgaris was found very generally, 
and in the most serious cases. No chromogenic bacteria were 
isolated, and cultures from a large number of green stools failed 
to develop green colonies. From these facts Booker concluded 
" that not one specific organism, but many different varieties of 
bacteria, are concerned in the etiology of the summer diarrhoeas 
of children."

Boarct t 1887, p. 7. 



146 INFANT MORTALITY 

From 1889-95 Booker continued his studies, isolating bac- 
teria from the rectum in ninety-two infants affected with epidemic 
diarrhoea, and also from the organs of thirty-three infants who 
died from this disease. He found the conditions for the 
development of bacteria in the intestine of infants affected 
with summer diarrhoea different from those in the healthy in- 
testine of breast-fed infants, in that they favoured more varied 
bacterial vegetation, a rich growth of the inconstant species of 
intestinal bacteria, and a more uniform distribution through the 
intestine of the two constant varieties of healthy excreta bacteria 
(JB. coli communis and B. lactis cerogenes}. The first step in the 
pathological process and this is a matter of great practical 
importance Booker believes to be a direct injury to the 
epithelium from abnormal or excessive fermentation and from 
toxic products of bacteria ; and secondly, a general intoxication 
brought about indirectly through the production of soluble 
poisons. He holds that, bacteriologically or anatomically, 
three principal forms of summer diarrhoea of infants may 
be provisionally distinguished : (i.) dyspeptic or non-inflam- 
matory diarrhoea ; (ii.) streptococcal gastro-enteritis ; and (iii.) 
bacillary gastro-enteritis. 1 As a result of his researches, Booker 
came to a general conclusion, which he expressed as follows : 
" No single micro-organism is found to be the specific exciter of 
the summer diarrhoea of infants, but the affection is generally to 
be attributed to the activity of a number of varieties of bacteria, 
some of which belong to well-known species, and are of ordinary 
occurrence and wide distribution, the most important being the 
streptococcus (enteritidis} and Proteus vulgaris" The strepto- 
coccus, termed S. enteritidis, varies in biological character, and 
seems to be associated with two classes of cases, one of which 
simulates cholera, the other typical enteric fever. It may be 
added that Cumston, Hoist, Escherich, and Flexner, have also 
laid emphasis upon the causal relationship of several streptococci 
and diarrhoea.

Klein was one of the first workers to isolate an anaerobic 
organism from cases of epidemic diarrhoea. This organism, 
which he named B. enteritidis sporogenes, was found in three 
successive outbreaks of diarrhoea occurring among patients in 
St. Bartholomew's Hospital. In the first two outbreaks the milk 
was evidently the channel of infection, in the third it was some 
rice pudding. B. enteritidis sporogenes is a widely-distributed 
organism, and occurs in normal and typhoid excreta, in sewage, 
manure, soil, dust, and milk. 1 The etiological relationship 
between this bacillus and epidemic diarrhoea has been called in 
question, and it is not proved that the organism is the cause of 
the disease. On the other hand, it has been frequently found 
in the mucous flakes of the dejecta in patients suffering from the 
disease, and in the outbreak produced by the consumption of 
cooked rice pudding, it is difficult to understand how any 
organism except an anaerobe of highly resistant qualities could 
have produced the condition. It will be apparent, moreover, 
that B. enteritidis sporogenes fulfils in some degree the require- 
ments suggested by Ballard. 

That epidemic diarrhoea is caused by the B. colt either alone or 
in conjunction with other organisms, has been held by a number 
of authorities. Cumston, who investigated 13 cases of the 
disease, concluded that B. coli associated with Streptococcus 
pyogenes was the chief pathogenic agent concerned, and he 
claims that the virulence of B. coli is exalted by the association. 2 
Lesage also formed the opinion that the disease was due to 
B. coli, and investigated the agglutinative properties of the serum 
of children suffering from epidemic diarrhoea on B. coli isolated 
from the intestine. He obtained a positive result in 40 out of 50 
cases, and the serum of each of these 40 cases, also agglutinated 
samples of B. coli from 39 other children seized with the same 
disease.3 Some of the most recent work on the relationship 
existing between B. coli and epidemic diarrhoea has been done 
by Delepine, who examined milk in an outbreak of epidemic 
diarrhoea which occurred in Manchester in 1894, and has also

examined a large number of town and country milks. His 
conclusion is that : 

" The infectious properties which food acquires frequently in 
summer and which give rise to the ordinary or common type of 
epidemic diarrhoea, are generally due to bacilli belonging to the 
colon group, of which B. coli communis (Escherich) and B. enteri- 
tidis (Gaertner) are probably two extreme types. I have come 
to the conclusion that the varieties of these bacilli, which are the 
most important sources of infection, are those which resemble 
the bacillus of Gaertner, and which therefore produce no per- 
manent acidity, coagulation, or distinct smell when grown in 
milk. . . . Epidemic diarrhoea of the common type occurring 
in this country is apparently, in the great majority of instances, 
the result of infection of food by bacilli belonging to the colon 
group of bacilli, and which are present at times in faecal matter. 
It appears that this infection of food does not generally lead to 
serious consequences, unless the infection is massive from the 
first, or the food is kept for a sufficient length of time, and under 
conditions of temperature favouring the multiplication of these 
bacilli. 

" Milk, which is the most common cause of epidemic diarrhoea 
in infants, is usually infected at the farm, or (through vessels) in 
transit. Of the bacilli of the colon group which are capable of 
rendering the milk infectious, those which do not produce a 
large amount of acid, and do not coagulate milk, are the 
most virulent, and are probably the essential cause of epidemic 
diarrhoea." I 

In 1898 the subject was advanced a step further by Shiga's 
isolation of the B. dysenteric from dysentery in Japan. This 
organism is now -regarded as the cause of epidemic dysentery, 
and by some authorities as an important, if not the most im- 
portant, cause of epidemic diarrhoea. In any case, there is sub- 
stantial evidence for believing that it is a type of the diarrhoeal 
organism, producing the disease either by itself or in association 
with streptococcus. As a result of investigation into epidemic 
diarrhoea in the United States Flexner is of this opinion. 2

EPIDEMIC DIARRHOEA 149 

It is evident that our knowledge of the bacteriology of 
diarrhoea is not sufficiently established to permit of any very 
definite conclusion on the matter. It may be that the whole 
group of choleraic, enteric, and diarrhceal diseases are caused 
by a group of micro-organisms having many similarities and 
relationships to each other; or it may be that different forms 
of diarrhoea have their own specific causal organism ; or, lastly, 
it may be a question of association of organisms or of toxins 
which brings about the disease. 1 In any event there is 
abundant evidence that epidemic diarrhoea is a specific disease 
caused by bacteria.

Though not by any means complete, our knowledge of 
the conditions which favour the occurrence of this disease 
are, on the whole, further advanced than our knowledge 
of its Etiology. And here again we may well accept 
the provisional conclusions of Ballard as a starting- 
point. They may be stated as follows : 

(a) " The summer rise of diarrhceal mortality does not 
commence until the mean temperature recorded by the 
f^ur-foot earth thermometer has attained somewhere about 
56 F., no matter what may have been the temperature pre- 
viously attained by the atmosphere or recorded by the 
one-foot earth thermometer. 

(ft) The maximum diarrhceal mortality of the year is 
usually observed in the week in which the temperature 
recorded by the four-foot earth thermometer attains its 
mean weekly maximum. 

(c) The decline of the diarrhceal mortality is in this 
connection not less instructive, perhaps more so, than 
its rise. It coincides with the decline of the tempera- 
ture recorded by the four-foot earth thermometer, which 
temperature declines very much more slowly than the

p. 395 (Martin), 404 et seq. (Klein). 



150 INFANT MORTALITY 

atmospheric temperature, or than that recorded by the 
one-foot earth thermometer ; so that the epidemic mortality 
may continue (although declining) long after the last- 
mentioned temperatures have fallen greatly, and may 
extend some way into the fourth quarter of the year. 

(d) I do not wish it to be inferred that the atmospheric 
temperature and the temperature of the more superficial 
layers of the earth, exert no influence on diarrhoea. Their 
influence, however, is little if at all apparent until the 
temperature recorded by the four-foot earth thermometer 
has risen as stated above ; then their influence is apparent, 
but it is a subsidiary one." * 

In addition to these conditions of soil, Ballard and 
other workers have pointed out that insanitation in the 
widest sense of the term favours epidemic diarrhoea. 
Density of population or houses upon an area, unclean 
soil, dusty surfaces, bad light, absence of ventilation, 
maternal neglect, contaminated food, &c., all have a share 
in creating an environment favourable to the disease. 2 

We may take the inquiry into predisposing conditions 
a stage further, by quoting the conclusions of Dr. News- 
holme, of Brighton, who published an elaborate paper on 
the causation of epidemic diarrhoea in 1899. Some of 
his chief conclusions, which are now widely accepted, 
were as follows : 

"(i) Epidemic diarrhoea is chiefly a disease of urban 
life.s (2) Epidemic diarrhoea as a fatal disease, is a 

1 Loc. cit., pp. 2-3. 

3 To remedy these conditions, which are favourable to the occurrence 
of diarrhoea, Ballard proposed nine sanitary reforms, viz., the removal of 
filth from the soil, domestic and social cleanliness, sealing of the soil 
around dwelling-houses, lowering the ground water by drainage, pre- 
vention of soil emanations, free ventilation about dwellings, protection of 
food from infection, improved drainage and sewerage, and an advance in 
general sanitation. 

3 In 1898-1902 the death rate from epidemic diarrhoea was 11-5 in urban 
districts and 5-0 in rural, but in particularly-affected large towns it may 
rise to 48 (Preston). 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHOEA 151 

disease of the artisan and still more of the lower labouring 
classes to a preponderant extent. This is probably 
largely a question of social status per se ; that is, it is 
due to neglect of infants, uncleanly storage of food, 
industrial occupation of mothers, &c. (3) Towns which 
have adopted the water-carriage system of sewerage 
have, as a rule, much less diarrhoea than those retaining 
other methods of removal of excrement. (4) Towns with 
the most perfect scavenging arrangements, including the 
methods of removal of house refuse, have the least 
epidemic diarrhoea. It has recently been suggested that 
epidemic diarrhoea is due to surface pollution derived 
from street dust, particularly dried horse manure (Waldo). 
(5) The influence of the soil is a decided one. Where 
the dwelling-houses of a place have as their foundation 
solid rock, with little or no superincumbent loose material, 
the diarrhceal mortality is, notwithstanding many other 
unfavourable conditions and surroundings, low. On the 
other hand, a loose soil is a soil on which diarrhceal 
mortality is apt to be high (Ballard). The pollution 
of soil is probably the important element in the causation 
of diarrhoea in towns on pervious soils. (6) Given two 
towns equally placed so far as social and sanitary 
conditions are concerned, their relative diarrhoea mortality 
is proportional to the height of the temperature, and the 
deficiency of the rainfall in each town, particularly of the 
third quarter of the year." z 

Dr. Newsholme concludes that " the fundamental 
condition favouring epidemic diarrhoea is an unclean 
soil, the particulate poison from which infests the air 
and is swallowed, most commonly with food, especially 
milk." In other words, epidemic diarrhoea is a so-called 
" filth-disease," preventable by improved sanitation in the 
broadest meaning of the term.

152 INFANT MORTALITY 

From the facts and suggestions quoted above, and they 
are but representative of many other similar views 
receiving the general support of epidemiologists, it will 
be evident that, at the present time, the belief is held 
that the cause of epidemic diarrhoea is to be found in 
four conditions, which may be expressed shortly as two 
propositions, thus: (i) Epidemic diarrhoea is a bacterial 
disease ; and (2) its occurrence depends, wholly or partly, 
upon surrounding temperature and deficiency of rainfall, 
upon urban and social conditions, and upon pollution of 
food, chiefly milk, or other articles intimately associated 
with the life of infants. The exact relationship which 
these conditions bear to each other is not known. Some 
authorities hold that a certain temperature affects food 
unfavourably. Others believe that it is a question of 
pollution of milk by dust and dirt carried by flies or air 
currents, which transmit to the milk the causal micro- 
organisms, and that deficient rainfall favours this contami- 
nation, and increased temperature favours the growth and 
multiplication of the bacteria thus conveyed to the infant. 
As Dr. Newsholme says, " Whatever be its mode of 
operation, a frequent fall of rain during the summer 
weeks, even though its total amount be not great, is one 
of the most effectual means of keeping down the 
diarrhceal death rate " ; x and whilst he considers tem- 
perature conditions of great importance, " rainfall is 
more important than temperature in relation to epidemic 
diarrhoea." Rain washes the air, if the expression may 
be allowed, and carries to the surface aerial dust. It 
reduces the atmospheric temperature, and of course it 
also washes the surface of the soil and removes surface 
pollution, and with it micro-organisms capable of infecting 
infants either by food or in some other way to be hereafter 
discussed. It should be added that Dr. Niven, of Man- 
1 Annual Report on Health of Brighton, 1902, p. 48. 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHCEA 153 

Chester, believes " that it is temperature rather than 
rainfall which is the determining factor of a high 
diarrhceal death rate." 1 

The practical problem of this disease as distinct from 
the scientific which deals with the causa causans is there- 
fore reducible to fairly simple terms. It is a question 
(a) of meteorology, (b) of contaminated or injurious food, 
and (c) of social conditions and domestic insanitation. It 
is now our business to consider these three matters. 

I. THE RELATION OF METEOROLOGY TO DIARRHCEA. 

The crucial meteorological conditions believed by 
Ballard to initiate fatal epidemic diarrhoea were mainly 
three : 

(a) The four-foot earth temperature, which he held as 
an essential datum, must be somewhere about 56 F. 
before the summer rise of diarrhceal mortality commences ; 

(b) The maximum diarrhceal mortality occurs in the 
week in which the four-foot earth temperature attains its 
weekly maximum ; 

(c) The mortality decline coincides with the decline of 
the temperature recorded by the four-foot thermometer. 

These conclusions were arrived at twenty years ago, and 
although in recent years many observers have found that 
these three propositions do not hold good in all localities 
or in every season, there has been a general agreement 
with the principle underlying them, and an increasing 
body of evidence obtained in support of the intimate rela- 
tion existing between earth temperature at the depth of 
four feet and the mortality of epidemic diarrhoea. 

In applying these propositions, however, to actual 
experience over a number of years, it has been found that

EPIDEMIC DIARRHOEA 155 

a margin of variation must be allowed. In Finsbury we 
have for several years kept daily record of the tempera- 
ture recorded by a four-foot thermometer placed in the 
soil near the Town Hall and the incidence of fatal 
diarrhoea, and it will be convenient briefly to refer to our 
findings, which are set out in the table on opposite page. 
Each year's results possesses its own interest, and the 
inter-relation of rainfall and temperature are clearly 
shown. But for convenience we may take 1904 as a 
typical year of heavy diarrhceal fatality, and by means of 
the attached chart follow some of its indications. 

In the first place it will be noticed that the four-foot 
thermometer registered a temperature above 56 in the 
first week in July, and the number of deaths of infants 
from diarrhoea began to increase in the week following. 
Secondly, the maximum mortality (18 deaths in a week) 
occurred one clear week before the maximum temperature 
was reached. Thirdly, the mortality decline did not 
coincide with the decline in temperature, and the epidemic 
of mortality was practically over a week before the four- 
foot earth thermometer fell below the critical temperature 
of 56 F. Throughout the epidemic period the rainfall was 
lower than usual, and the temperature, though not excep- 
tionally high, was over 56 F. for fourteen weeks. In August 
(with favourable temperature and low rainfall) the mor- 
tality reached a high figure, 40 per cent, of the infants 
dying in the second trimester of their life. From these 
facts it becomes clear that two out of the three propositions 
of Ballard did not hold in Finsbury in 1904, but the broad 
fact of the earth temperature acting as an indication of 
forthcoming fatality is almost perfectly illustrated. 

The same may be said generally of the other years in the 
five included in the table. But there are other points to 
notice. In 1901 an exceptionally high temperature in June 
gave no result, but its continuance into July, even though 



156 INFANT MORTALITY 

there was a good deal of rain, yielded the highest return of 
infant mortality for that month in the qumquenniad. The 
infants dying were in the second and third trimesters of 
their first year of life. And in each of the other years as 
the total mortality declines the decline is chiefly in the 
second trimester. In each of the years the infants under 
three months of age respond less to temperature than at 
the other two age periods. In 1902 and 1903 the condi- 
tions of season were unfavourable to a high mortality 
among infants partly on account of lower temperature, but, 
as far as one can judge, mostly on account of increased 
rainfall. There is, however, this singular characteristic, 
that in both years with a temperature and a rainfall un- 
favourable, in September there is an explosion of mortality 
which does not occur in the other three Septembers. 
Further, this feature of " ferocity," as it is described by 
Ballard, affects infants under three months as much as the 
older infants. The percentage total of infants under three 
months on total infant deaths in 1903 the lowest mor- 
tality year and in 1904 the highest mortality year is the 
same (23 per cent). In 1905 we also see signs of the 
ferocity of the disease in August. 

Such being the outstanding facts for Finsbury, we may 
now turn to consider the experiences of other districts, and 
to illustrate the complexity of this influence of temperature 
and to bring out some important points as to its moment 
of operation, we may briefly consider the recent experience 
of ten towns where observation is kept on the matter : 

i. At Brighton, in 1903, the four-foot temperature reached 
56 F. on June ist, and in 1904 on June i2th, but no deaths 
from diarrhoea occurred in 1903 until the week ending July 4th 
(*.<?., a month later), and none in 1904 until the week ending 
June 25th (i.e., a fortnight later), and then none during the three 
subsequent weeks, although the earth temperature remained over 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHGEA 157 

58 F. from June 26th onwards. Indeed, in both years there was 
no substantial increase until the latter half of August, some ten 
weeks after the four-foot temperature had reached the critical 
point of 56 F. Expressed in another way, it happens that in both 
years the average earth temperature from July to October was 
almost identical (6o'6 and 60-7), and the deaths from diarrhoea 
were low, 44 in 1903 and 48 in 1904. But in 1904 the average 
of the maximum temperature of the air during each week was 
higher by 4^ per cent., the aggregate rainfall was less by 
60 per cent., and the number of rainy days was fewer by 
23 per cent, than in 1903, and yet the excess of fatal diarrhoea 
in 1904 was only four deaths. 1 

2. In 1904 the four-foot temperature at Blackburn reached 
S6F. in the week ending July 23rd, but there was no marked in- 
crease in diarrhceal deaths until September, six weeks later. 2 

3. "In the case of Nottingham the temperature of the four- 
foot thermometer, at which a serious increase of diarrhoea is to be 
looked for, is not commonly 56 but about 58." Dr. Boobbyer 
considers that of the general truth of Ballard's theory there can 
be no doubt, but he adds, " the incidence of epidemic diarrhoea 
is also largely dependent upon the rainfall. "3 

4. At Croydon, in 1903, the four-foot temperature rose above 
56 in the week ending July 4th, and remained above that 
temperature until the end of the second week in October. There 
was no increase in diarrhceal fatality until the beginning of Sep- 
tember (seven weeks later), and even then but a very slight 
increase. In 1904 the critical temperature of 56 was reached in 
the week ending June 25th, and the rise in the number of deaths 
from diarrhoea began in August. In the former year the atmo- 
spheric temperature was over 60 in May, and in the latter year 
reached 60 in June, without any apparent result on the disease.* 
The effect of rainfall in combating the evil influence of sustained 
high temperature is also shown. " During the summer of 1903 
there were 49 days on which rain fell and only 22 deaths under 
one year from diarrhceal diseases, while in the summer of 1904

there were only 28 days on which rain fell, and as many as 96 
deaths under one year from diarrhoeal diseases." 

5. In Dublin, in 1904, the atmospheric temperature was 
above 60 in the second quarter of the year, and the four-foot 
temperature above 56 on July loth, but there was no substantial 
difference in the diarrhoeal diseases until August. 1 The mean of 
the readings of the four-foot earth thermometer in the third 
quarter was 57. 

6. Or if we now take some examples of towns where the atmo- 
spheric temperature is used as indicator the difficulties do not 
become less. The experience at Hull furnishes some facts of 
interest. The periods in three decennia may be taken as 
illustrations :

Here the atmospheric temperature is taken in place of the earth 
temperature and averages in place of actual figures. We should 
expect to find, however, some meteorological differences sufficiently 
marked to account for the enormous divergence in the number of 
diarrhceal deaths. But such differences in temperature are not 
marked. On the contrary, with the exception of the fact that 
each of the low diarrhceal years had a similar low atmospheric 
temperature, there is no explanation for the great differences in 
the diarrhceal fatality, particularly in 1903, when the rainfall was 
exceptional. One cannot study such returns without being im- 
pressed by the fact, not only that there is some other factor 

1 Earth Temperature and Diarrhoeal Diseases in Dublin in 1904. (1905.) 
(Sir J. W. Moore.) 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHOEA 159 

besides temperature, but that temperature was here exerting a 
subsidiary and indirect influence upon differences in diarrhoea 
deaths so enormous. 1 

7. Dr. Niven states his experience as to the relation of meteo- 
rological conditions to diarrhoea in Manchester as follows : " The 
autumnal rise in the number of deaths [from diarrhoea] is usually 
sharp in one particular week, and corresponds to the rise of the 
mean daily temperature in the week preceding up to or about 
60 F. There is no doubt that the temperature of the atmosphere 
is in close relation with the increase of Summer Diarrhoea. The in- 
fluence of the rainfall is, in the main, I believe, a secondary one. 
The rainfall may be high and yet the Summer Diarrhoea death rate 
be high ; or it may be low and the Summer Diarrhoea rate may 
be low. Thus in the third quarters of 1893 an d l %95 the rainfall 
was high, yet the Diarrhoea death rate was also high. In the 
third quarter of 1902 the rainfall was unprecedently low, and so 
also was the Diarrhoea death rate. On the other hand, the mean 
temperature of the quarter was high in 1893 and 1895, an d in 
1902 it was low. A high rainfall tends to lower the temperature, 
but where it fails of this effect Diarrhoea is in excess. On the 
other hand, in spite of a low rainfall, the atmospheric tempera- 
ture may be low, and then there is no excess of Diarrhoea. In 
no year, however, is the death rate from Diarrhoea in excess of 
the mean without a corresponding excess in the mean tempera- 
ture of the atmosphere." 2 

In his report for 1903, Dr. Niven recalls that in 1900 a study 
of the daily curves of temperature and of the diarrhoea deaths, 
arranged according to dates of attack, show that " atmospheric 
temperature reacts in a day or two on the incidence of diarrhoea," 
but he adds that the experience in that year (1900) shows also 
that " neither the highest death rate nor the greatest increase of 
cases coincides with or closely follows the maximum atmospheric 
temperature" 3 

8. At Bolton in 1904 the four-foot earth thermometer registered 
an average temperature of 57 F. in August, and in the latter half 
of the month the diarrhoea deaths increased, the total for the

month being 35. In September the temperature of the four-foot 
thermometer fell to 5 5 '5 F., and each week as the temperature 
went down the number of deaths rose to a total of 62 for the 
month. There were 44 deaths in a fortnight ending October ist, 
when the earth thermometer registered only 54*5 F.

This table affords illustration of the variation which occurs in 
different years even when the mean temperature of the air is 
approximately the same. In 1902 and 1903 the temperatures 
were much alike throughout the four months, but the yield of 
deaths in 1903 was more than double that of 1902. No doubt 
there were other factors present, one of which was probably 
rainfall. And even if we compare the mean temperature of 
the months with the yield of deaths we shall see marked 
discrepancies. 

10. Dr. Hope, of Liverpool, has furnished in a recent report 
four charts for the four third quarters of 1901-4, in which he 
illustrates the relation of rainfall and mean temperature of air to 
diarrhoea deaths, and upon which two remarks may be made. 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHCEA 161 

First, in comparing 1901 and 1904 with the intervening years, it 
is found that the mean temperature in the former frequently rose 
far above the thirty years' average, and remained so for several 
days together. It seldom fell below the average, and the rainfall 
was scanty. The result was much diarrhoea in both years. The 
years 1901-2, however, had a heavy rainfall and a low mean 
temperature, and the death rate from diarrhoea was less than half 
of that which occurred in 1901 and 1904. Secondly, it is noticeable 
that in each year the atmospheric temperature was above 60 F. 
for a number of weeks before there was any increase whatever in 
the diarrhoea deaths. 1 Even though, unfortunately for purposes of 
comparison, these four charts record the atmospheric temperature 
instead of the four-foot earth temperature, it may be said that on 
the whole they represent the broad relationship between tempera- 
ture and rainfall and diarrhoea fatality as clearly as could be 
desired. 2 

Now whilst there appears to be considerable conflict of 
evidence as to the exact temperature at which diarrhceal 
mortality increases, dependent upon other meteorological 
conditions such as rainfall, and, as we shall see subse- 
quently, dependent also upon certain urban and social 
conditions, there are some broad and well-recognised facts 
which are indisputable and upon which all observers are 
agreed. It is not only simpler, but it is also likely to 
be more accurate, to be guided by such findings than by 
the differences and divergencies of detail. 

The first among such proved facts is that epidemic 
diarrhoea becomes both most prevalent and most fatal in the 
third quarter of the year. It is unnecessary to produce 
statistical tables on this point, for it is universally recog- 
nised as obtaining throughout the United Kingdom 
Infantile diarrhcea is a disease of the late summer months. 
Of that there can be no possible doubt. And translated

detail. In the Appendix (p. 339), however, will be found the admirable 
tables of Dr. Cameron for Leeds for the past fifteen years. 

M 



162 INFANT MORTALITY 

into terms of temperature, this means that an excess of 
diarrhoea, both in attack and fatality, occurs only when 
there is, or has been in the immediate past, an excess of 
atmospheric temperature. In relation to the occurrence 
of diarrhoea such temperature is best measured by the 
four-foot earth thermometer, for the simple reason that at 
that depth in the soil temperature varies but slightly from 
day to day, and therefore indicates only in slow and long- 
measured steps the seasonal changes of a year. It does 
not tell a different story from the atmosphere, but as a 
medium it is less affected by hours of sunshine and shade, 
and so reveals what may be called the common denomi- 
nator of the sun's effect on the earth's surface. 

Secondly, we shall only mislead ourselves if we study 
temperature, whether of atmosphere or soil, as if it were 
the only factor in the causation of epidemic diarrhoea. 
Its influence, as Ballard pointed out, is " exerted indirectly," 
and it is but one factor, possibly a fundamental one, yet 
only one among many operating in the production of this 
disease. 

The following conclusions, though of a less certain 
character, also seem admissible : 

1. That whilst Ballard's critical temperature (56 F.) 
broadly indicates the principle of an intimate relation 
existing between earth temperature and diarrhceal mor- 
tality, the maximum mortality and its decline do not 
coincide with maximum temperature and its fall, nor is 
56 F. invariably the earth temperature at which diarrhceal 
mortality rises. (The records of Bolton in 1904, Glasgow 
in 1901, Brighton and Croydon in 1903 and 1904, Finsbury 
in 1904, Liverpool in 1902-3, illustrate these variations 
from Ballard's rule.) 

2. That rainfall and temperature must be taken together, 
the fallacy of taking them separately being very clearly 
seen in comparing 1903 and 1904 in Finsbury, both years 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHCEA 163 

having an earth temperature of 55 F., but the former 
being a low mortality year and the latter a high mortality 
year. In fact, it does not appear to be possible to take 
temperature alone, at any figure, as a fixed standard. 

3. The variations in earth temperature and its effect on 
infant mortality, be it what it may, does not materially 
affect infants under three months of age, except when 
great in volume or "ferocious" in fatality. 

4. High temperatures at four-foot depth in June or 
earlier do not produce an effect on infant mortality from 
diarrhoea. The same remark applies to high atmospheric 
temperature in June, as may be witnessed in the Glasgow 
record in 1901 and Hull in 1894 and 1902. The contrary 
is true also, for mortality from diarrhoea may be high with 
low temperature. 

5. A prevalence of fatality among infants higher than 
the average towards the end of the summer appears to be 
connected with a deficiency in the earlier weeks of the 
epidemic period, and it is greater in proportion as the 
epidemic period falls late in the season. 

These variations are of importance in guiding us amid the 
devious ways of diarrhceal epidemicity, but we must not 
allow them to obscure the broad principle which emerges 
from the facts presented and which is beyond dispute, 
namely, that a sustained high atmospheric temperature, as 
indicated by the four-foot earth thermometer, particularly 
if simultaneous with a low rainfall, conduces to a high 
diarrhceal mortality and a low atmospheric temperature 
to a low diarrhceal mortality. 

The Operation of Temperature. 

Before leaving this subject of the relation of temperature 
to diarrhoea, it is necessary to inquire as to the way in 
which temperature operates in favouring diarrhoea. Upon 
this point there is much diversity of view and on the 



164 INFANT MORTALITY 

whole but few facts. Some hold that a sustained high 
temperature depresses the system of infants, who thus 
become more susceptible to illness. It may be so, but in 
such event there remains unexplained the comparative 
health of infants on the south coast of England, where 
the mean temperature of the atmosphere is some 
degrees higher than in the north, which yet has a 
higher infant mortality. Still more so is it difficult to 
explain, if this view be true, the survival of infants in 
the tropics and in many other parts of the world 
where the mean temperature is higher than in temperate 
climates. 1 Though no doubt variations of temperature 
exert an effect on infant life, it becomes clear that this 
cannot be the only or indeed the chief means of 
operation. 

Others maintain, and they claim Ballard in support of 
their view, that a temperature of 56 F. at a depth of four 
feet stimulates or favours the growth or increase of a 
" miasm " which is produced by organic agency in the super- 
ficial layers of the soil and finds its home there. This 
miasm, they urge, however it be formed and to whatever 
bacterial action it may be due, emanates from the soil after 
the critical temperature has been reached, and produces 
an effect on persons comparable to miasmatic influences 
which give rise to certain forms of low fever in the tropics. 
The provisional findings of Ballard which we have quoted 
(see p. 144) are claimed in support of this view, and the 
incidence of the disease on children and infants is further 
held to lend it support. But the advocates of this theory 
have difficulties not less formidable to explain than those 
who hold that high temperature operates mainly by de- 

1 The Secretary of the Royal Observatory at Greenwich informs me 
that at five meteorological stations in India where earth thermometers are 
used, Lahore, Jaipur, Dehra Dun, Allahabad, and Calcutta, the monthly 
mean temperature at four feet is above 56 F. throughout the year, and 
at Calcutta is over 70 F. 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHOEA 165 

pressing the physical condition of the individual. There 
are at least three such difficulties. In the first place there 
is the fact to be hereafter proved, that epidemic diarrhoea 
is an urban disease, that the more town-like is the com- 
munity and the more dense the buildings per acre, so 
much the more is the diarrhoea. Yet the greater the density 
of the buildings per acre, the greater is the open soil 
sealed and the more complete is the land drainage. What 
" miasm," it may be asked, can emanate through the con- 
creted surface of the metropolis ? The underground soil 
in our large towns consists, moreover, in no small measure, 
of the necessary foundations of buildings, streets, drainage, 
and means of communication. It comes indeed to this, 
that epidemic diarrhoea is frequently most prevalent where 
miasmatic emanations are impossible in any large measure. 
Then, again, if high temperature operates by favouring a 
soil miasm, we should expect persons of both sexes and all 
ages to be attacked. But the malady falls in a preponder- 
ating degree upon children under two years of age, and 
" the male sex is distinctly more liable to it than the 
female, and this at all ages from birth upwards " (Ballard). 
With the exception of the aged this is largely, though not 
exclusively, a children's disease. There must be in its 
causation some factor mainly concerned with children of 
tender years. If that be so it is quite certain that such a 
factor cannot be found in an influence having a universal 
operation. But it may be argued, as indeed it often is, 
that the influence, though universal, is of a character to 
which only the very youngest and the very oldest, that is 
presumably the most susceptible portions of the community, 
are prone. There is, however, a third difficulty to be met 
with in face of such argument, namely, that it is not the 
youngest who are attacked. No age incidence whatever 
enjoys complete immunity, but by far the chief burden of 
this disease falls not upon the youngest infants but upon 



166 INFANT MORTALITY 

infants aged four months to eight months. A disease with 
such definite limitations of scope as this, that it mainly 
attacks town infants in the middle of their first year of life, 
is not one which can be explained by a general soil miasm. 

We must therefore look elsewhere for the explanation 
of the operation of high atmospheric temperature on 
diarrhoea. And we shall probably find the true explana- 
tion is a simple one requiring but few conditions for its 
fulfilment. Epidemic diarrhoea is a disease mainly affect- 
ing the alimentary system. Its other phenomena, con- 
vulsions, fever, and collapse, are reflex and secondary to a 
general disease of a specific character. It is not, in kind, 
a new growth like a tumour or cancer ; nor is it a trauma- 
tism like a fracture or mechanical injury ; nor yet is it a 
constitutional disease like syphilis or tuberculosis. It 
is a plain and straightforward infection, or, as we have 
seen, not infrequently an intoxication, of the alimentary 
canal, of such a kind and in such a degree as affects the 
whole body, and in time nearly every organ. Such a 
disease must be conveyed by food, and perhaps chiefly by 
a fluid food. Not always or invariably in the same form 
or way, but as a rule the vehicle of infection or intoxica- 
tion must be food. And here a most important fact 
should be remembered, namely, that the stomach of an 
infant has but a small digestive power and secretes a low 
percentage of acid. Hence infected food is likely to pass 
undigested and " unsterilised " into the intestine, there to 
set up irritation. 

Now, what is the effect of a sustained high temperature 
of the atmosphere on food ? The answer is that such 
a temperature favours the growth of infective bacteria 
and processes of decomposition. Moisture, pabulum, and 
a high temperature are the three cardinal require- 
ments of bacteria. Those conditions being granted, 
their multiplication and toxin-producing power becomes 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHOEA 167 

exceptionally great. This has been shown in respect of 
milk by many workers. 1 The moisture and pabulum of 
milk are a fit nidus, and if its temperature be raised to 
summer heat the increase in the number of organisms is 
extremely rapid. Unclean milk is almost a solution of 
bacteria and little short of rank poison to an infant. Nor 
is it the number of organisms alone which is affected. 
There is now abundant evidence to show that patho- 
genicity or virulence of milk is increased by rise of 
temperature. 2 Professor Deldpine of Manchester found 
that mixed milk coming from a distance of more than 
forty miles, and generally kept for from twenty-four to 
sixty hours or longer, showed an increase of virulence 
on inoculation into guinea-pigs in proportion to the 
mean temperature in the shade in Manchester during the 
time the specimens were k'ept.3 What is produced in a 
few hours in summer may occur also in winter when the 
milk has been kept a long time. 

A sustained high atmospheric temperature, however, 
exerts an indirect effect on milk and other foods in a 
threefold manner. First, it favours the occurrence of dust 
and dirt, especially when combined with a low rainfall ; 
secondly, it favours the growth of bacteria in such dust 
and dirt ; and thirdly, it is one of the chief agencies 
favourable to the breeding of flies, which with air-currents 
and domestic manipulation, serve as the means by which 
milk and other foods become polluted with dust and dirt, 
and the organisms conveyed by such particulate matter. 
Every one knows that in hot, dry summers, particularly in 
towns, dust is increased in amount and "gets everywhere." 
Such dust particles act, as Tyndall showed thirty years 
ago, as " rafts " for the conveyance of organismal life.

3 Jour, of Hygiene, 1903, vol. Hi. p. 83. 



168 INFANT MORTALITY 

Now, if it be granted that the causal organisms of 
diarrhoea may exist in such dust, here, indeed, is ample 
means for the contamination of milk and other articles. 
But, in addition to these facilities of pollution, there are 
flies, which undoubtedly increase in number normally in 
the late summer, if the atmospheric temperature be high. 
Dr. Niven, the Medical Officer of Health of Manchester, 
has argued that by a process of exclusion we come to the 
house-fly as an agency in the dissemination of diarrhceal 
infection. 1 By means of a number of beer-traps Dr. Niven 
contrived to count the flies in some dozen houses in Man- 
chester during the summer months of 1904, and from these 

1 In 1904 Dr. Niven carried out an extended inquiry into the causation 
of summer diarrhoea in Manchester, with the following results : 

The conclusions arrived at as the result of this inquiry may be thus 
summed up. (I.) The high fatality from summer diarrhoea is largely due 
to the ailing condition of the infants when attacked. Their previous bad 
health is due to a variety of causes. Of these the most serious are slovenli- 
ness on the part of the mothers and ignorance of what is necessary so that 
an infant may be well nourished. But their health is also assailed by a 
variety of unhealthy conditions, especially by dirty floors, insanitary 
closets and back passages, dirty fingers, &c., introduced into their mouths, 
occasional clouds of dust, and so forth. 

(II.) Yet, in spite of all this, infants fed at the breast, even in unfavour- 
able situations remain comparatively well, and generally escape diarrhoea, 
and even when fed on cow's milk they may enjoy good health when 
reasonable precautions are taken. The immunity of breast-fed infants is 
surprising in the light of what we have found parents doing in the way of 
rubbing children's gums, and of other errors. The percentage of such 
children attacked is fully explained. It is probable that children fed at 
the breast are not allowed to crawl about dirty floors to the same extent 
as other infants. 

(III.) With regard to the mode in which infection is introduced, we 
have seen that direct infection plays a large part. This does not explain 
why the disease attacks so many fresh houses within a comparatively 
short time in the late summer and autumn. Partly it may be that the 
disease is imported from without by milk. We have seen, however, 
that there is strong reason to doubt whether the autumnal rise can in this 
way be explained. 

(IV.) There does appear, on the other hand, to be considerable reason 
for believing that the disease is often carried from one house to another 
by the common house-fly . . . which will cause inoculation of infection 
n all liquids capable of nourishing the specific organism, as well as on 
over-ripe fruit, &c. If capable of explaining transmission from house to 

mse, the migrations of the house-fly are also capable of explaining a 
general and rapid increase of the infective micro-organisms (Rep. on 
Health of Manchester, 1904, p. 210). 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHOEA 169 

data he concludes that the advent of the house-fly in 
numbers precedes by a short time the increase in the 
number of deaths from diarrhoea. In the fortnight ending 
August 1 3th, for instance, the number of flies caught in 
these traps was 37,521, the maximum in any fortnight, 
and in the fortnight following the maximum number of 
deaths from diarrhoea occurred namely, 192. It is true 
the descent in the number of deaths preceded the diminu- 
tion in the number of flies, but that may well have been 
due to other factors, and does not invalidate the theory, 
which was indeed strengthened when the number of flies 
was compared with the attacks rather than the deaths from 
diarrhoea. Dr. Niven summarises his view at the end of 
1904 by saying that his observations "increase the pro- 
bability that flies act as transmitters of summer diarrhoea, 
and that they may take a considerable share in producing 
the autumnal rise. 1 Dr. Newsholme and many other 
medical officers of health have repeatedly drawn atten- 
tion to some relation they believe to exist between flies 
and the occurrence of epidemic diarrhoea. In 1902, Dr. 
Newsholme proclaimed "a crusade against the domestic 
fly, which is most numerous at the seasons and in the 
years when epidemic diarrhoea is most prevalent, and 
probably plays a large part in spreading infection." 
The evidence that flies do carry bacteria on their feet 
or bodies is positive though meagre. On the whole it 
would appear that at present more cannot be said than 
that the house-fly may act in conjunction with other 
agents as a means of food contamination with the 
infective virus of epidemic diarrhoea. 

From the evidence obtainable it is shown that an inti- 
mate relation exists between high atmospheric tempera- 
ture and epidemic diarrhoea. The influence is, however, 
indirect, and is concerned, it is believed, with the food of 
1 Report on Health of Manchester, 1904, pp. 200-210. 



170 INFANT MORTALITY 

infants with its pollution and the increase of its toxicity 
and infectivity. It is that broad conclusion which con- 
tinues to receive the support of ever accumulating facts 
and which guides us as to the means of prevention. But 
even so, we shall be misguided if we neglect the factor 
of the infant itself. It is idle to consider the seed apart 
from the soil. 

II. THE RELATION OF CONTAMINATED FOOD TO 
EPIDEMIC DIARRHOEA. 

There are two series of facts which have been collected 
throwing light upon the relation of contaminated food to 
epidemic diarrhoea. The first series is concerned with 
outbreaks of the disease of a sudden and epidemic 
character ; the second deals with infantile summer 
diarrhoea of the ordinary kind apparently arising from 
contaminated food. 

In 1892, Gaffky recorded an instance in which three 
men connected with the Hygienic Institute at Giessen 
were suddenly taken ill. They had chills, fever, diarrhoea, 
and general symptoms. The only article of diet of which 
they had all partaken was milk, which was traced to a cow 
suffering from enteritis. The milk of this cow as it left the 
udder contained no bacteria. But bacteria gained access 
during the milking from the dried particles of faecal matter 
on the posterior portion of the udder. In these particles 
was found a bacillus which proved pathogenic for mice 
and guinea-pigs, and which corresponded to an organism 
isolated from the stools of the patients. 1 In 1894 an 
outbreak occurred at Manchester, 2 characterised by 
diarrhoea, sickness, and abdominal pains. The cases 
numbered 160 in forty-seven houses, or just 50 per cent.

Niven). 



EPIDEMIC DIARRHOEA 171 

of the houses served by one and the same milk-seller. 
Raw-milk drinkers were the chief sufferers, and those not 
drinking the implicated milk did not suffer. Near the 
farm were 40,00x3 tons of privy-midden refuse. The water 
used for washing the milk-pails was polluted. The stored 
milk could be readily contaminated from emanations from 
the cowshed. Professor Delepine examined the milk, and 
found B. coli communis abundantly present, and Dr. Niven 
elicited the fact that a cow affected with inflamed udder 
("garget") had been removed from the farm and 
slaughtered. The outbreak was attributed to milk in 
any case, and to the probable infection of it by the 
diseased cow. But Delepine has pointed out that it is 
more probable that the milk was contaminated with faecal 
pollution rather than infectious disease of the cow. 1 

In 18952 an d 18983 three outbreaks of epidemic 
diarrhoea occurred amongst the patients at St. Bartholo- 
mew's Hospital, London, traceable in the first two instances 
to milk, and in the third to rice pudding made with milk.4 
On Sunday night, October 27, 1895, an outbreak of 
diarrhoea affected 59 in-patients, all of whom had 
recently taken milk, and from the evacuations the spores 
of B. enteritidis sporogenes was isolated by Klein. The 
patients suffered quite irrespective of whether or not the 
milk had been boiled. Some milk, also derived from the 
same source as the milk which had caused the poisoning, 
was examined by Klein, and found to contain the spores 
of the same organism. On Sunday, March 6, 1898, a 
second outbreak of severe diarrhoea occurred in this 
hospital affecting 146 patients, and there was evidence on 
this occasion also that the medium of infection had been 
milk. On August 5, 1898, a third outbreak affecting 84

patients and two nurses took place at the same hospital, 
the vehicle of infection in this instance being some rice 
pudding made with milk, also said to contain an organism 
similar or identical with the B. enteritidis sporogenes. 
There can be little doubt that milk was the agent of 
infection in each of these three outbreaks. In these out- 
breaks B. enteritidis sporogenes (Klein) was isolated, and 
held to be the specific organism, not only of these out- 
breaks, but of ordinary summer diarrhoea. 1 

The second series of facts, those, namely, concerned with 
the contamination of the food of infants suffering from 
epidemic diarrhoea in the summer, will be dealt with in a 
subsequent chapter (see p. 221). Here it is only necessary 
to say that there is now a large body of evidence which 
has been steadily accumulating since Ballard wrote, in 
1887, to tne effect "that infants fed solely from the breast 
are remarkably exempt from fatal diarrhoea, and that infants 
fed in whatever way with artificial food, to the exclusion 
of breast-milk, are those which suffer most heavily from 
fatal diarrhoea." 2 Such artificial food may be cow's milk 
or condensed milk or other article of diet liable to con- 
tamination or infection. 

Delepine has urged that milk is infected at the farm or 
in transit, as many of the milks which he examined and 
proved to be virulent had not been exposed to any in- 
fluence attributable to a consumer's home, but was, in fact, 
infective before it reached the consumer.3 He considers 
the injurious properties of such milk is due to faecal pol- 
lution and the action of B. coli, B. enteritides of Gaertner, 
or allied organisms. Newsholme considers such contami- 
nation may be responsible for setting up epidemics of

diarrhoea occurring in connection with a particular milk 
supply, as in the analogous case of epidemics of infectious 
diseases, such as typhoid, but he holds that the ordinary 
sporadic cases of diarrhoea, which carry off single children 
in large numbers in urban districts, are due " chiefly to 
domestic infection of milk or other foods, or to direct 
swallowing of infective dust." z It is possible that we 
have a double pollution of milk in actual practice, one 
originating at the farm, one brought about subsequently. 
The latter may be produced by flies from manure heaps, 
or from dust in roads and yards of towns, or from the 
generally filthy manipulation of the milk from the time 
when it becomes the property of the milk-seller to the 
moment of consumption. It should not be forgotten in 
this relation that stale milk may contain toxic properties 
altogether apart from, and in addition to, actual bacteria, 
and that such products of organismal action have a much 
greater effect in the causation of diarrhoea than is generally 
supposed. 2 

However that may be, it can scarcely be denied that the 
evidence which Newsholme and others have produced in 
support of the view that diarrhoea is mainly due to domestic 
infection of milk or other articles is overwhelming. It 
must not be forgotten that farm infection or infection during 
transit of milk must involve massive results among milk 
consumers, which, excepting epidemics, does not occur.s 

III. THE RELATION OF URBAN AND SOCIAL CON- 
DITIONS TO DlARRHCEA. 

We shall find in a later chapter that "urbanisation" 
bears an intimate relation to infant mortality as a general

problem. In the present section we need consider such 
influences only in so far as they operate directly upon 
epidemic diarrhoea. 

We have already seen that infant mortality is higher in 
the towns than in the country. The same applies to 
epidemic diarrhoea, the occurrence of which is indeed one 
of the chief factors in the high infant mortality of the 
towns. 1 For whilst this disease may cause death in rural 
districts at a rate of only 5 per 1,000, the death rate rises in 
the towns to between 20-30 per 1,000 (Liverpool, Wigan, 
Warrington), or between 30-40 per 1,000 (Manchester, 
Salford, Blackburn, Burnley, Bury, and Bolton), and even 
to rates per 1,000 above 40 (Preston). The most notable 
difference indeed between rural districts and the towns is 
in just this matter of diarrhoea of which the mortality may 
be as much as seven or eight times as great in the towns 
as in the country. 

Nor is the difference less marked when we come into 
towns and compare the most urban portion of large towns 
with the least urban portion. The medical officer of the 
administrative county of London has shown that it is the 
most central of the metropolitan districts, and those which 
are most densely populated with the poorer classes, which 
suffer most from epidemic diarrhoea. 

In Manchester it has been found that not merely on the 
average of ten years but for individual years the death 
rates from diarrhoea show that the fatality from this 
disease is much higher in the Manchester township than 
in the South Manchester or the Northern districts. 2 The 
same is true of Birmingham, in the wards of which city 
the diarrhceal death rate in 1904 varied from 4-3 per 1,000 
in St. Bartholomew's Ward to only IT 2 in Edgbaston and

Harborne. r Indeed so marked is the difference, that 
Dr. Robertson adds that "for practical purposes all the 
deaths [from diarrhoea] occurred in small houses occu- 
pied by the artisan classes, that is to say, this enormous 
mortality among infants [from diarrhoea] is limited to the 
working classes. No deaths occurred in any middle-class 
or better-class houses during the time of the inquiry. In 
a few instances cases were investigated of deaths in houses 
of six, seven, or eight rooms, but in each of these there 
were special circumstances which brought them within 
the meaning of artisan houses." He then gives a table 
showing that 6*5 one-room houses per 1,000 were invaded, 
5*4 two-room houses, 16*5 three-room houses, 10*4 four- 
room houses, and o - 6 houses of more than four rooms 
each, and adds : 

" In a general way it has always been recognised that 
diarrhoea in its fatal form was more prevalent among the 
poorer classes than among the better classes, but the fore- 
going statement gives this general impression in a much 
more accurate form. Indeed, it indicates very clearly 
that, for one reason or another, the middle and better 
classes are able to prevent their infants from contracting 
this fatal disease, whether the children be breast-fed or 
bottle-fed. It also clearly indicates that effort in the 
direction of preventing the spread of the disease must be 
chiefly directed among the working classes 98^ per cent, 
of the deaths having occurred in houses of five rooms 
or under, and only i| per cent, in houses of over five 
rooms." 2 

The same is true of every large town. In Glasgow the 

1 Rep. on Health of Birmingham, 1904, p. 36. 

3 Ibid., pp. 38-39. As long ago as 1879-83 Dr. Tatham showed that 
diarrhoea was exceptionally fatal in back-to-back houses. In districts 
having no such houses the death rate was 1-54, whilst in districts having 
50 per cent, of back-to-back houses the diarrhoea death rate rose to 2-83. 
Dr. Sykes has shown a similar rise of infantile death rate from diarrhoea 
in stable dwellings (Public Health and Housing, 1901, p. 45). 



176 INFANT MORTALITY 

diarrhoea mortality rate varies from 1,698 per million in 
the Dalmarnock Ward, and 1,686 in the Calton Ward, to 
238 per million in the Park Ward, and 201 in Kelvinside. 1 
But there is no need to furnish elaborate evidence on this 
point, for the view that epidemic diarrhoea is mainly an 
urban disease has been long established and was abun- 
dantly confirmed by Dr. Newsholme in 1899 (p. ISO). 2 He 
showed that the disease is most fatal among the lower 
labouring classes, especially in towns with imperfect 
scavenging arrangements and without a water-carriage 
system of sewage. 

The last twenty years have but added weight to Ballard's 
dictum that "domestic darkness and general dirtiness of 
dwellings are conducive to diarrhoea mortality ; dirtiness 
with bad ventilation constitutes the condition known as 
1 fustiness ' ; and it is very much in the parts where these 
conditions prevail that the diarrhoea mortality is highest." 
On the other hand, it is instructive to observe that although 
Ballard's nine proposed sanitary remedies have, with two 
exceptions, all been carried out in large measure, epidemic 
diarrhoea is still increasing. The two exceptions are 
domestic and social hygiene and the protection of food 
from infection and contamination.

diarrhoea in thirty-one large towns. 



VII 

THE INFLUENCE OF DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 

IT is a well-known fact that communities in which there 
is a large measure of poverty have a higher mortality 
from all causes at all ages than communities better cir- 
cumstanced. This, of course, is not due only to poverty 
per se, but to all that poverty involves heredity, 
upbringing, education, food, housing, overcrowding, &c. 
The life expectation of Hampstead, for instance, is greater 
than in Southwark, of Mayfair than of Stepney, and at 
all age periods, although the excess is greater at some ages 
than others. The difference in the figures between Hamp- 
stead and Southwark, to cite an example, is striking, 
and the infant mortality during 1897-1900, which was 
for Hampstead 136 per 1,000 for males and 104 for 
females, rose to 203 and 170 per 1,000 for the same age 
and sex in Southwark. 1 The same thing occurs, as we 
have seen, in every large town. In the three poorest 
wards of Birmingham the infant mortality was 232, 263, 
and 331 in 1904, as compared with 133 in Edgbaston. In 
Ancoats, Manchester, it was 202 per 1,000 in 1904, but in 
Chatham and Crumpsall it was 91 and 108 respectively. 2

Tables for Hampstead and Southwark), pp. 16-21. 

3 In Capetown, in 1904, the infant mortality of European children was 
1 14-4 per 1,000, but amongst coloured races it was 27i - 5 per 1,000, showing 
the difference in social life and infant management in the same town.

178 INFANT MORTALITY 

It is necessary in the present chapter to consider the 
reason for this phenomenon. 

In his first annual report the Medical Officer of Health 
for the county of London (Sir Shirley F. Murphy) pub- 
lished a chart showing the infant mortality in the various 
metropolitan districts for the years 1885-92. Hamp- 
stead, Hackney, Plumstead, Lewisham, and Wandsworth 
on the circumference, and St. George's, Hanover Square, 
in the more central part of London, yielded an average 
infant mortality rate over the eight years of under 141 per 
i ,000, whereas the Strand, Holborn, St. George's-in-the- 
East, and Limehouse, and what is now Southwark, yielded 
a rate of over 180 per 1,000. The difference between 
these infant mortalities represents not a difference in 
occupation only, but in domestic conditions and in social 
life. Occupation, no doubt, is indirectly concerned, as was 
pointed out by the Sanitary Commission of the Metropolis 
in 1843, a return of which shows that the proportion of 
deaths of infants to children born was I in 10 in the 
professional and well-to-do classes, I in 6 in the families 
of tradesmen, and I in 4 among the working classes. 
Ansell also showed that the infant mortality of the 
professional classes was exceptionally low, namely, 8o'4, 
as compared with an average of 150 among the non- 
professional classes, and in some of the large towns an 
even higher figure. 1 But in these cases occupation has 
been taken as an index of social conditions of wealth 
and poverty. As recently as 1898 it was shown that in 
Hamburg the infant death rate was 2*0 per 1,000 in the 
rich quarter and io - 8 in the poor quarter. 

These differences depend upon the varying circum- 
stances of the districts affected, and it will be necessary 
to discuss the chief of these seriatim. Broadly, the 
conditions which operate in greatest force are urbani-

DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 179 

sation, housing and poor social life, alcoholism, and 
birth rates. 

(a) URBANISATION. 

According to the classification adopted in the census 
returns for England and Wales, the urban population is 77 
per cent, of the whole, whereas fifty years ago it was only just 
over 50 per cent. It is the fact that for two persons who 
in 185 1 lived in a town, three or more are so situated at the 
present time, but it must be remembered that the term 
" urban " merely means those districts that for the 
purpose of local administration have an urban organi- 
sation. In reality, much of the urban districts is rural, 
and enjoys in some ways even superior advantages, 
owing to the greater completeness of sanitary legislation 
and administration for such areas. A better way, perhaps, 
to represent the increase in urbanisation which has taken 
place is to state it in terms of large towns. For example, 
a century ago, the total population of England and Wales 
was 8,892,536, of whom 1,486,017, or 167 per cent, lived 
in towns of over 20,000 persons. In 1904 the population 
of England and Wales was 33,763,434, of whom 19,965,055 
lived in towns of over 20,000 persons. This gives 59*1 per 
cent, of the population living in large towns now, as against 
167 in 1 80 1, or an increase of 71*1 per cent, in 1904. In 
1801 there were five "great towns" having a population 
of more than 50,000, and eight " smaller towns " with a 
population of between 20,000 and 50,000, making thirteen 
towns in all. In 1904 there are 76 great towns and 142 
smaller towns, or 218 in all. 

Now, with all the advantages which urban life offers in 
the way of better sanitation, it cannot be doubted that this 
profound change of the growth of the towns has not a 
little to do with a stationary infant mortality. For not 
only is country life a better environment for infancy, but 



180 INFANT MORTALITY 

town life brings with it many conditions and circum- 
stances which counteract in respect of infancy its advan- 
tages. Nor am I thinking now of overcrowding, polluted 
atmosphere, condition of employment, and so forth. It 
is not these things which mainly affect infancy, though 
even these exert an indirect effect. It is rather the habits 
and customs of town life which militate against healthy 
infancy, especially in the artisan classes, to whom infant 
mortality is almost confined. Life in a large city means 
for the artisan limited accommodation (not necessarily 
overcrowding), late hours, short nights, manufactured 
foods, stress and strain, alcoholism, small excesses, and 
an almost total absence of restfulness, leisure, and home 
life. The homelessness of the people is one of the 
worst features of town life, and is operating injuriously 
on infancy. Of that I do not think there can be any 
doubt in the mind of a careful observer of the life of the 
poor in a great city. He may not be able to put his 
finger upon any one item which is affecting the mother 
and killing the infant, for an infant is a complex organism, 
and bears within itself a temperament, a physique, and an 
heredity composed of a vast array and medley of influences 
inextricably interwoven. But he will be able to say that 
the general conditions of domestic life in a city tenement 
are such as to make the rearing of infants a difficult and 
doubtful undertaking. Sanitation and preventive medi- 
cine have in the past done much to protect the individual 
from the evil in his environment. The future will lie 
with the State that is able to protect the individual 
against himself. And to do that it must build on the 
family life in the home, for the home is the unit of the 
State. 

The evidences, therefore, of the effect of urbanisation 
upon infant mortality are of a general character. Many 
years ago Dr. Farr pointed out that in a healthy district 



DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 181 

the infant mortality under one month was 145 per 1,000, 
in England as a whole 571 per 1,000, and in an urban com- 
munity, such as Liverpool, 672 per 1,000, and that it 
declined as the months went by, but in the healthy 
community it declined 86 per cent, in the first year, 
whereas in the urban district it declined only 59 per cent. 1

This is the almost universal experience, and in that 
which follows this grave disadvantage of urbanisation to 
infancy will become abundantly clear. 

() HOUSING AND POOR SOCIAL LIFE. 

The effects of overcrowding on death and sickness rates 
is a difficult matter to measure. That the effect is con- 
siderable and detrimental there cannot be the least doubt. 2 
It is admitted on all hands that where there is most over- 
crowding there is the highest death rate from phthisis, 
from infectious diseases, and indeed from all causes. But 
beyond that it is difficult to go with any assurance of

accuracy. If we could observe a community all living 
continuously under conditions of marked overcrowding, 
each individual spending his whole life under such condi- 
tions, then we should be in a position to state with more 
confidence the exact part which this social evil takes in 
the causation of disease and death. But as it is we 
can only judge the matter broadly. The table on the 
opposite page is an attempt to state this matter in 
figures. 1 

The results appear to show that the smaller the tene- 
ment, i.e., the more " overcrowded " the family, the higher 
is the death rate from all causes and from the diseases 
named. This is an instructive result when it is considered 
that each of the three years tells the same story, and that 
as many as 4,000 deaths are tabulated on a population of 
approximately 100,000 persons. It is necessary, however, 
to recognise that the figures are of relative value only, for 
it must not be assumed that a man dying, say, of phthisis 
in a one-roomed tenement in 1905 has lived all his life in 
that tenement. He may only have been living there a 
few months or years, his disease having been contracted 
elsewhere. Indeed such is highly probable, for phthisis 
leads to poverty, and poverty leads to smaller tenements. 
But even as a relative return the figures are instructive, 
and illustrate in a marked manner the broad fact of the 
evil effects of living under " overcrowded " conditions. 

It should be borne in mind that these death rates have 
not been " corrected " for sex or age incidence, and are 
not, therefore, comparable with other districts of a like 
character. 

The following table, with similar drawbacks, has been 
drawn up to illustrate the same conditions of housing in 
relation to infant mortality from all causes and from 
certain causes :

These figures show a much higher fatality among infants 
from all causes living in one-room homes in Finsbury in 
1905 than in infants in two-, three-, or four-room homes. 
On the whole, too, it is evident that the effect is more 
accurately denoted in these rates than in the rates in the 
former table for the simple reason that there is no fallacy 
on account of different age incidence, the infants all 
being of one age, namely, under twelve months. More- 
over, in very few cases indeed did the infant die in 
any other tenement, whether larger or smaller, than 
that in which it was born. We have, therefore, here an 
approximately accurate representation of the distribution 

1 This number includes those births which took place in institutions

DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 185 

of infant mortality as regards tenement property in cen- 
tral London. 1 

The infant deaths from diarrhoea show the same distri- 
bution, though the percentage fall of infant mortality from 
this disease from one-room homes to four- or more roomed 
homes is even more marked (64 per cent. cf. with 55) than 
the infant mortality from all causes. But the results 
are different when the infant mortality from prematurity 
and immaturity be taken, for in such diseases there is 

1 There has been proceeding for a number of years a change of usage 
more than a change of actual property. Whole streets and squares of 
houses, formerly occupied by single families and often good-class families, 
are now occupied as separate dwellings on separate floors. The private 
house has become a tenement house. There is a common passage and a 
common staircase, both of which are open to the public, and the passage 
and staircase act as the ventilating shaft for the foul atmosphere derived 
from the dwelling-rooms opening on to the stair. The history of such a 
house is a dismal record of degeneration. Year by year the state slowly 
but surely becomes worse. The house was structurally designed for one 
family and is now occupied by four or more families. The sanitary con- 
veniences were also designed for one family and now provide for four 
families. The same must be said of the water supply and wash-house 
accommodation. There can be no doubt that the ill-ventilation and the 
difficulty of access to the sanitary convenience, scullery, wash-house, or 
dust-bin may indirectly act as causes of ill-health and undesirable habits. 
Hence it comes about that both house and tenants degenerate. 

Another of the general characteristics of house property in Central 
London is that the yards in the rear of the houses have, in many cases, 
been built over. The condition of things constantly to be observed is 
this : Between two streets, running parallel, there existed, when the 
houses were first built, an open space, subdivided into yards. Thus fresh 
air was obtainable in the rear as well as in the front of the houses. In 
the yards were constructed various conveniences for sanitary purposes, 
washing, refuse collection, &c. Thus the house, as a private house, was 
equipped. But in addition to the invasion of tenants, to which reference 
has already been made, there has been an industrial invasion. The yards 
became covered in or otherwise built over for workshop premises. Even 
when such buildings are only small they effectually prevent through 
ventilation on the ground floor. But so extensive have such buildings 
become in certain cases, that a large portion of the open space originally 
existing between the street backs has been filled in. The houses thus 
become, practically speaking, back-to-back houses. Moreover, the imme- 
diate proximity of some kinds of workshops to dwelling-houses readily 
gives rise to nuisances of various kinds. 

Here, then, are two general conditions prevailing somewhat widely 
in Finsbury and Central London. First, the invasion of " self-contained " 
houses by an industrial population for whose accommodation the houses 
have been let in tenements. Secondly, the growth of warehouse and 
workshop accommodation.

an increased mortality in infants living in thrae-room 
homes. Any deductions drawn from this table must, 
of course, be stated with reserve, as it deals with 
only one year and only 429 deaths, and particularly 
does this remark apply to the column of death rates 
due to prematurity. Broadly, however, its meaning is 
obvious. 1 

"In the poor and crowded districts," writes Mr. Booth, 
" infantile deaths represent on the average 6*3 out of a 
total death rate of 23 per 1,000." And to illustrate the 
distribution he selects eleven districts of (a) a central 
class, () an upper class, and (c) a lower class as judged 
by social conditions, and then he works out the infant 
mortality rate for the years 1894 and 1895, making need- 
ful allowance for deaths in institutions by returning the 
deaths to the districts from which the patients had come. 
In his previous volumes he had shown that poverty and 
overcrowding go together on the whole. From these later 
tables he is able to demonstrate, what indeed has been 
known for long enough, that both birth rate and death rate 
from all causes and in infants are high in proportion to the 
degree of poverty and overcrowding. In the "central"

crowding in tenement property to infant mortality in the following

division infant deaths count for 47 out of 177 as the 
death rate after infancy, in the upper-class division for 
3 '2 out of 147, and in the poorer classes 6-3 out of 167. 
In all classes infant life is very precarious, and in this 
respect the advantage of the well-to-do is perhaps less 
than might be expected. But of the total born in the 
poor section, i6'9 per cent, or one-sixth die in the first 
year ; in the central section, 14*8 per cent. ; and in the 
upper division, 13*2 per cent. No doubt the presence of 
a good many poor, even in generally well-to-do districts, 
is among the causes which tend to equalise the figures. 
How marked is the difference between districts wholly 
poor and wholly well-to-do may be seen by selecting such 
districts from the three tables. 1

The conditions in the working-class area (3) were 
favourable. " There is no overcrowding, there are no 
back-to-back houses, no public-houses, the streets are 
wider than Areas i and 2, and many of the houses have 
small gardens in front. Generally speaking, it may be 
said that this section consists of people who are comfort- 
ably off, and are living under sanitary conditions." The 
figures in the last two columns of the above table make it 
evident that the high infant mortality in Area i is not due 
wholly, as might be urged, to ignorance in the feeding and 
management of infants rather than to causes arising out of 
the poverty and environment of the people. If that were so 
the high death rate would be confined to infancy, but as a 
fact it is common to all ages above infancy. 

Similar evidence is forthcoming from almost every large 
town having " slum " conditions in some of its wards, par- 
ticularly if those slum conditions concern domestic and 
social life in addition to external environment. Birming- 
ham affords a marked example. Its infant mortality rate 



190 INFANT MORTALITY 

in 1904 was 195 per 1,000 births, which placed it at the 
bottom of the list, with Stockport 203, Hanley 212, and 
Burnley 229 for 1,000 births. When we come to inquire 
into this high rate of 195 we find that eight wards in the 
city of Birmingham in 1904 had an infant mortality rate 
of over 200 per 1,000 births, the three highest being St. 
Stephen's Ward 232, St. Bartholomew's 263, and St. 
Mary's 331. The chief diseases carrying off children, 
3,000 infants per annum, appear to be (a) diarrhoea and 
enteritis, (&) debility and marasmus, (c] bronchitis and 
pneumonia, and (</) prematurity diseases mainly due to 
evil social conditions and infant mismanagement. Dr. 
Robertson, the Medical Officer of Health of Birmingham, 
drew up a special report on the conditions existing in 
these three wards, and it is necessary to consider some 
of the facts to which he draws attention. 1 The Floodgate 
Street area covers some 1 14 acres, and consists of some 
twenty-five streets (and courts) accommodating 9,878 
persons. In fourteen of these streets the death rate from 
all causes was found to be 30 per 1,000 or above. In 
Allison Street it was 49'6, and in Park Street 63*5 per 
1,000. The whole area had a death rate of 31 '6 as com- 
pared with 19-3 for Birmingham, that is to say, it was 
60 per cent, higher than for the whole city. Some of 
the chief death rates for particular causes may be com- 
pared not only with Birmingham, but with a more or less 
typical artisan district (All Saints' Ward) having an infant 
mortality of 173 per 1,000, and with the satisfactory con- 
ditions of Edgbaston, as shown in the table opposite. 

Here we see at a glance an ordinary district contain- 
ing a large artisan population under fair sanitary and 
social conditions compared with the Floodgate Street

area, Edgbaston, and the City itself. Dr. Robertson 
describes the figures in the first column as "typical 
of a poverty-stricken, insanitary, and vicious population. 
Improper and insufficient food weakens resistance against 
many diseases, such as phthisis, marasmus, &c., while this 
along with carelessness and exposure increases the deaths 
from inflammatory diseases of the lungs." x He recognises 
that bad housing, poverty, and evil social conditions are

the main causes of this condition of things which works 
such havoc among the most susceptible portion of the 
population, the infants, and some of his findings must 
be quoted. He reports : 

(i.) House Accommodation. In the inspection which has been 
made of the Floodgate Street area, I have taken into account 
certain other conditions, such as Housing, Poverty, &c. The

Floodgate Street Area and the Municipal Wards of St. Mary, St. Stephen, 
and St. Bartholomew (1904), p. 9.

192 INFANT MORTALITY 

rental of 1,577 of these houses was ascertained from the 
tenants : 

381 were under 45. rental per week; 
655 were from 43. to under 53. rental per week ; 
172 were from 53. to under 6s. rental per week; 
101 * were from 6s. to under 73. rental per week; 
268 x were 73. or over rental per week. 

Two-thirds of the recorded houses were of rentals under 53. 
per week. By themselves, these figures indicate that a fair pro- 
portion of the houses are of what would appear to be low rental, 
but when the wages of the occupants are inquired into, so much 
poverty exists that it is somewhat remarkable that more effort to 
economise by taking two families into one house was not made 
than we actually found. . . . 

Twelve hundred and thirty-six houses were of the back-to-back 
type, of which it is said there are between 30,000 and 40,000 
in the City. Only 698 were "through" houses. The number 
of available through-cottage houses is, therefore, very small. 

Excepting the shops and public-house premises, and a com- 
paratively small number of houses mostly of recent construction, 
practically all the houses are built on the courtyard system 
where a yard common to a number of houses supplies the air 
space where one water-tap in the yard is the only water supply, 
and where one closet is for the common use of two or more 
houses. 

In the large majority of the houses the old type of " settle," 
or undrained sink, still exists, so that, in addition to the above 
disabilities, the people have not reasonable facilities for disposal 
of slop water. Indeed, there is so much trouble entailed in 
getting water into the house, and afterwards disposing of it, as 
slops, that I am rather surprised to find so many people keeping 
their houses and themselves clean. . . . 

To return to the typical courtyard house. It is the prevailing 
type, not only in this district, but in the central part of our City 
generally. It has one living-room and a pantry on the ground 
floor ; one, two, three, or even four bedrooms above, the number 

1 In some of these the front room was used as a shop. 



DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 193 

depending on the area of the living-room and the number of 
storeys. In a considerable number of houses a cellar is formed 
below the living-room, the floor of which is supported on an 
arch. Most of these houses are damp from one or more of the 
following causes : 

(i) Want of a damp course few houses of this type were pro- 
vided with a damp course ; (2) the floor of the living-room being 
formed of tiles (" quarries ") laid on the earth, or on the arch of a 
cellar, the stones of which are charged to their utmost with 
moisture; (3) defective pointing, roofing, spouting, or brick- 
work making the outside walls damp; (4) undrained "settles" 
(sinks). 

A house with damp walls and floors is, I am convinced, a 
cause of much ill-health among a city population. Often, indeed, 
the damp may not be sufficient to make the paper fall off the 
wall ; but short of this such a house is cold, and has a moist atmo- 
sphere in it. V 

In a considerable number of cases the inner surface of the 
walls is broken and defective, allowing of lodgment of dust, and 
preventing proper cleansing. In many cases the ceilings are 
broken and bulged, and the woodwork of the windows, doors, 
floors, and skirtings are broken, rotten, or generally defective, so 
that the occupants have no inducement to keep their houses 
clean and tidy, as they can never get them to look well. 

The air space attached to these courtyard houses in insuffi- 
cient, and the general condition of gloom and dirt makes life far 
from what it ought to be. The courtyard itself should be 
cleansed twice a week, or oftener, by the tenants ; but what is 
everybody's duty is nobody's, and, therefore, in the majority 
of cases it is seldom, if ever, cleansed unless the landlord pays 
for its regular cleaning. 

In many of these courtyards pan-closets still exist. The 
stench from these, even when the pans are empty, pervades the 
courtyard, and can be smelled in the interior of the house. 
These closets, like the houses, are of the cheapest and most slim 
construction. They are constantly getting out of repair. They 
are, like the yards, used by more than one house, and it is only 
reasonable to expect that one tenant will object to cleanse away 
filth made by another. The housing conditions are distinctly 



194 INFANT MORTALITY 

bad in a considerable proportion of the houses, but these 
conditions are no worse than they are in many other areas 
in the City. 

(ii.) Poverty in the Area, The condition of poverty in which 
the people in this area live has impressed me more than any 
other feature. The time of our inquiry was one of trade de- 
pression, and such a condition falls more heavily on the poor 
class and inefficient craftsman than on the steady and efficient 
workman. Again, the area is occupied by a large number of 
unskilled labourers, whose average wages (in Birmingham), I am 
informed, varies from 175. to 2 is. a week. Street-hawkers, 
barrow-men, and persons employed in a host of ways all more 
or less with poor incomes live in this area. 

We therefore found that a very large number of persons were, 
from their own statements, in poverty. In addition, however, to 
the statements given, an inspection of the houses confirmed me in 
the opinion that great poverty did exist, even if one accepted the 
statements of the people with suspicion. 

In the following tabular statement I have attempted to codify 
the information given us as to the total earnings of each family. 
The statement must be looked at as being probably inaccurate to 
the extent of 10 or even 15 per cent. The tendency is to under- 
state one's income. Among casual labourers it is difficult at any 
time to obtain reliable information, but the statement on the next 
page is sufficiently accurate to indicate the extent of the poverty. 

It is, I think, impossible for a man living in the centre of the 
City, and employed as a labourer at the standard rate of wages, 
to keep a wife and family of three children without being in 
poverty. This, notwithstanding the fact that he does not spend 
anything on drink or tobacco, or on travelling to and from his 
work. His only chance of getting enough for house rent, cloth- 
ing, and fuel lies in the family earnings being increased by his 
wife's earnings, or by the earnings of a child, or by taking in 
lodgers. The necessity, therefore, exists among this large class 
for the wife to leave her young children to go to work, and of the 
children being put to work at the earliest opportunity. If any- 
thing be spent on drink, actual poverty is at once evident. 

On the area we found a large number of skilled artisans who 
admitted receiving good wages, and who were apparently living in 






DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 195 

conditions of poverty from drink, gambling, or other unnecessary 
expenditure. The amount of ill-health to which poor living, 
bad housing, and inferior surroundings give rise increases the 
poverty. 

Many people have fallen into such a condition of poverty as to 
be unable to furnish a house of their own, and have to go into 
lodgings of one kind or another.

In addition to twenty common lodging-houses there are fifty-four 
registered houses sub-let in lodgings, having accommodation for 
297 persons. These are occupied by the most depraved and 
dirty of the population. They, however, fulfil a useful purpose, 
and, if further powers were obtained for their regulation, they 
form a means of housing the vicious and abandoned people who 
are a nuisance to their neighbours and a terror to landlords. 

(iii.) Drink and Ignorance as a Cause of Hi-health. In 
addition, however, to all the contributory causes already men- 



196 INFANT MORTALITY 

tioned, it is difficult to say whether drink, combined with 
ignorance and carelessness, does not play as important a part or 
even a more important part than all the conditions of bad 
housing, smoky atmosphere, and poverty. One cannot but be 
struck, in going over such an area in the evening, with the 
number of public-houses, and with the extent to which they are 
used as clubs. A large number of men and women in the area 
soak themselves with drink every day, thereby ruining their con- 
stitutions, bringing on poverty, and indirectly causing most 
unhealthy conditions. Bearing in mind such conditions result- 
ing from the excessive use of drink, the drink question has a 
public health aspect of the greatest importance. 

Such an area as this is the resort of a large number of the more 
careless and ignorant members of the population. This careless- 
ness and ignorance are " catching," with a result that people who 
would lead clean and healthy lives are contaminated by living in 
proximity to these degenerates. There is no doubt whatever that 
much of the misery in the area arises from the carelessness and 
ignorance of the tenants, and it would be unjust to say that the 
property owner alone was at fault in regard to the condition of 
the houses. 

Many of the houses, if occupied by clean, active persons, would 
have an entirely different appearance, and would be much more 
healthful than they are at the present time. 

Nearly every one who has had experience of such areas must be 
impressed with the vicious circle which exists. Bad housing, 
drink, poverty all have to be attacked along the broadest lines, 
and with a clear idea of the goal to be aimed at. 

I have included this long quotation in the text of this 
chapter, not only because it is typical, according to Dr. 
Robertson, of the conditions which occur to a greater or 
less extent in each of the three wards in question, but 
because it is typical of other somewhat similar areas, 
though possibly not so bad, as exist in other large towns. 
It is impossible to rear a healthy physical race under such 
conditions as these, and it is patent and obvious that so long 
as domestic insanitation exists to this degree the life of 



DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 197 

infancy among the poor cannot be otherwise than in- 
juriously affected. 

Even in Hanley, where a high percentage of women are 
engaged in the pottery industry, it has been shown that 
domestic conditions and housing are exerting an influence 
which is probably even more injurious to women and 
infants than the conditions of employment. In 1872 
Dr. Ballard, reporting to the Local Government Board 
upon the sanitary circumstances of the town (which then 
had a population of 40,000), wrote that "in all but the 
newer parts of the town the dwellings occupied by the 
operative and labouring classes are much neglected, dark, 
damp, unventilated, and often dilapidated. Many of them 
are utterly unfit for occupation, and ought to be closed ; 
some are so incapable of improvement that they ought to 
be demolished." In 1894 Dr. Sweeting, and in 1905 Dr. 
Monckton Copeman, inspecting the town on behalf of the 
Board, found very similar conditions prevailing, although 
"considerable improvement" had taken place since 1872.* 
In Dr. Copeman's opinion the disposal and removal of 
refuse is a still more urgent problem. In the poorer 
parts of the town it appears that ashes and other house- 
hold refuse are disposed of in ash-pits, usually of enormous 
size and frequently uncovered, so that the contents remain 
exposed to the effects of both sun and rain. " When, as is 
sometimes the case, these huge receptacles of semi-decom- 
posing filth are situated within a short distance 3 feet or 
less of the dwellings, their presence can hardly fail to 
exert an injurious effect on the health of the inmates, more 
especially the children. It would appear not unlikely, 
indeed, that this particular insanitary condition may 
play no inconsiderable part in the marked prevalence,

in the borough, of infantile diarrhoea during the second 
and third quarters of the year." x 

Formerly the contents of ash-bins and pits were used 
in considerable quantity for filling up inequalities of the 
ground on building sites in the town, but at the present 
time practically all such refuse is cremated in a recently 
erected destructor. 

The method employed in the removal of the contents of 
ash-pits and bins is decidedly unsatisfactory. The con- 
tents of the bins are removed in barrows and boxes by the 
men, and, in some instances, have to be carried through 
the living-rooms of the house. Once outside the house 
the material is " dumped " in heaps on the street alongside 
the footpaths ; these heaps are, in turn, shovelled into the 
cart when it comes along. Where large ash-pits are being 
emptied considerable heaps of the material are thrown out 
on the street, awaiting the arrival of the cart, and portions 
of this material are liable to be distributed by wind, &c. 

If the views expressed in an earlier portion of this volume 
be correct, it cannot be surprising if diarrhoea is prevalent 
in Hanley, as in fact is the case. From 1900 to 1903, 247 
infants died of epidemic diarrhoea in the town (exactly 80 
per cent, of all the diarrhoea deaths in that period), and the 
infant mortality rate was also exceptional (198 per 1,000 
from 1899-1903). Upon this point of the relation obtain- 
ing in Hanley between domestic filth and infant mortality 
I cannot do better than quote Dr. Copeman's official report. 
He writes : 

" The Medical Officer of Health is of opinion that the heavy 
infantile mortality is due to ' the excessive employment of adult 
female labour in the potteries,' with the consequent result that 
infants are put out to nurse and artificially fed. In this connec- 
tion he informs me that as the result of personal visits of inspec-

Hanley, 1905 (No. 217), p. 6. 



DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 199 

tion to fifty-three houses in which deaths of infants from diarrhoea 
had occurred during 1904, he found that the methods of feeding 
in the various cases had been as follows : 

In 27 cases infants fed on cow's milk ; currently reputed to have 

been boiled. 

,,15 Swiss milk. 

4 breast milk entirely [i.e., 8 per cent, of 

total]. 

" One case was fed on breast milk and patent food. In the 
remaining cases information was not obtainable. 

" However largely cow's milk, whether boiled or unboiled, has 
been responsible for fatal diarrhoea among Hanley infants, it is 
obvious that in the case of breast-fed infants the source of 
infection must be sought for in some direction other than milk 
contamination. 

" Whether or not the prevalence of zymotic enteritis be due to 
infection, directly or through the medium of food products such 
as milk by agency, for instance, of the bacillus coli communis or 
of bacillus dysenteric there is gradually accumulating a consensus 
of opinion that contaminated dust or detritus, whether conveyed 
by air-currents or by flies, may be responsible, especially in towns, 
for many diarrhoea attacks. And in Hanley, as I have shown 
earlier in this report, most favourable opportunities are afforded 
for the dissemination of germ-laden particles from the contents of 
the huge middens, more especially during the process of removal 
of their contents. In my opinion, indeed, one of the most 
urgently needed sanitary reforms in Hanley is the entire abolition 
of midden privies, and of existing ash-pits, with the provision in 
their place of proper water-closets, and of comparatively small, 
covered, and easily movable iron receptacles for house refuse." x 

The report states that the Town Council of Hanley 
were about to appoint a lady inspector under the Mid- 
wives Act, a part of whose duties would be to visit the 
dwellings of the poor and to endeavour to instruct the

Hanley, 1905 (No. 217), p. 10. 



200 INFANT MORTALITY 

women in the proper methods of feeding and rearing 
infants, and in the elements of general hygiene. " Should 
a capable person be appointed to the post," adds Dr. 
Copeman, " it is not improbable that the work may result 
in an appreciable diminution of the present high infantile 
death rate, which is certainly due in large measure to 
neglect and ignorance on the part of the mothers among 
the lower classes." 

One further instance may be taken, namely, a town 
situated in a manufacturing district in the north of England, 
having a population of not less than 20,000 persons, and 
characterised by two features, namely, a very high infant 
mortality and a very low percentage of occupied women. 
I have asked the Medical Officer of Health of this town, 
who has for years studied its life, to furnish me with the 
causes of the high infant death rate. For reasons which will 
appear, he stipulates that his name and that of the town 
shall not be mentioned. The following are the chief para- 
graphs in his letter : 

" The average infant mortality rate in A for the past ten 

years has been 205 per 1,000 births. The highest rates were, in 
1895 202, in 1899 220, and in 1901 235. The lowest were, in 
1894 170 and in 1902 184. 

"The average birth rate for the last ten years has been 417. 
There are upwards of 4,000 houses, and the average number of 
persons per house is 5-4. The general average death rate is 227. 

" The working classes form at least 75 per cent, of the total 
population, and about 15 per cent, of the total population are 
small shopkeepers. The great majority of the men are colliers, 
or work in iron and steel works, and a few in other employments. 
There is one cotton mill in the district. Trade is fairly good, but 
subject to much fluctuation. . . . Less than 10 per cent, of the 
total number of married women are occupied. 

" Houses are held on weekly tenancy, and there are no slum 
areas, as the district is open everywhere. There are a good many 



DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 201 

old houses with common yards, but not many back to back. The 
yards of the older property are often unpaved and wet and dirty 
at times. The property built in the last ten years is better and 
with separate yards, not always flagged. The sanitary conve- 
niences used in the town are privy-middens almost entirely. . . . 
I have often seen little children, even babies, playing and crawling 
about closets and middens, though we have a well laid-out park 
with plenty of grass open for children to play on, but it is little 
used. 

"There is a great deal of poverty, especially in summer, im- 
providence, and drink, much as in other places far too much. 
Ignorance, especially as to the care of infants, is almost universal, 
and carelessness is unfortunately much too common. . . . Infants 
are usually put into a ' burying club ' at birth, but all the parents 
draw in the event of death is 303., which only pays the funeral. 
It is the usual custom. . . . Nursing-out or baby-farming is very 
rare, though there may be a few cases here and there. I should 
say about 30 or 40 per cent, of all the infants are breast-fed, but 
I cannot be more definite. Of artificial food used by far the 
commonest is condensed milk, one or other brand, and then 
various advertised patent foods very little fresh milk. The 
old-fashioned long-tube baby's bottle is very largely used. Of 
the reasons given for not feeding the child by the breast I have 
heard many. The commonest is perhaps that ' the child never 
seems satisfied,' or ' it cries.' Sometimes the mother has no milk, 
and this, I fear, is fairly common, especially after a month or two. 
Then a good many will not be ' tied.' It is ' too much trouble, 
can't attend to the house,' and so on, though I have not often 
heard this openly admitted." 

The medical officer then furnishes me with particulars 
as to the causes of death, of which he names four as the 
chief: Diarrhoea, bronchitis, prematurity, and atrophy. 
From an examination of his official annual reports the 
following facts may be stated : 

Diarrhoea is the cause of some 25 to 27 infant deaths 
a year, though in the last four years the number 
has risen to an average of 39. The large 



202 INFANT MORTALITY 

majority (90 per cent.) occur in hand-fed infants, 
and especially those fed on condensed milk 
which becomes contaminated and infected in 
the home. An inquiry into the deaths of 21 
infants a year or two ago revealed the fact, that 
the parents of these 21 children had previously 
given birth to 98 children, of whom 55 had 
died in infancy. This would yield an infant 
mortality of 561 per 1,000 births. The medical 
officer attributes the heavy mortality from 

diarrhoea in A generally to poverty, drink, 

and lack of mothers' milk, and in particular to 
ignorance or carelessness, dirty bottles, improper 
food, and irregular feeding. 

Bronchitis and Pneumonia produce some 35 or 40 
infants' deaths per annum in this town, in many 
cases, it is reported, due to carelessness and 
ignorance on the part of parents. It appears 
that infants are left in charge of children hardly 
any older than themselves, and frequently exposed 
to cold air or wet clothing. 

Prematurity carries off between 40 and 50 infants 
every year. This cause of infant death is 
attributed to poor health, underfeeding, and 
want of care on the part of mothers, and to 
repeated pregnancies. 

The medical officer of this town concludes his letter 
as follows : 

"I regard the heavy infant mortality [205 per 1,000 
births] in this district as due in the main to social evils. 
Poverty, whether through lack of employment or drink, the 
dirty state in which houses and children are kept, and the 
ignorance and carelessness as to feeding and care of infants, 
are the main factors. So high a birth rate as we have in 
A must mean poverty among the labouring classes, 



DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 203 

for the wages do not expand with the family, and the 
margin is at best small. It also helps to keep the mothers 
in poor health, and aids the establishment (through poverty) 
of the too common diet of tea and bread and butter. 
Most of the girls start with anaemia and chronic stomach 
complaints through this tea and bread-and-butter diet. 
They marry early, and soon have a succession of puny 
children, of whom perhaps half survive infancy. 

" I do not think the sanitary condition of A is 

worse than that of other similar districts. We have many 
yards still unpaved and common yards. We have the 
privy-midden system, which is bad, but against that we 
have no large congested slum areas, though there are 
houses here and there in many streets which taken by 
themselves are almost as bad inside as slum houses. 
But this is due in most 'cases to dirty tenants. By 
attention to the housing question and other sanitary 
improvements the general death rate has been reduced 
in the last 15 years from an average of 26 or 27 per 
1,000 to 20 or 21 per 1,000. But the Infant Mortality is 
untouched, which seems to me to point distinctly to the 
truth of the view I take." 

(c] ALCOHOLISM. 

Before mentioning the relation of alcoholism to infant 
mortality in the mass it is necessary to determine, if possible, 
the prevalence or otherwise of alcoholism amongwo men. 

In 1894 Dr. Norman Kerr wrote that "England 
occupies the unenviable position of having a greater 
proportion, a proportion which has been steadily in- 
creasing of recent years, of cases of female inebriety 
than any other country. . . . Twenty years ago I rarely 
ever saw a female drinking at a bar of a public-house 
or a beer-house. Now I see numbers so engaged from 



204 INFANT MORTALITY 

an early hour in the morning not a few of these early 
risers and early drinkers having had an infant at the 
breast, and giving the child a share of the morning 
dram. . . . Prison experience shows a marked increase 
of female inebriates." x This opinion appears to be 
founded on personal observation which, if accurate, is 
important evidence and police returns. As to the former 
it is, of course, impossible to speak. The opinion is often 
expressed that alcoholism among women is not only 
prevalent but increasing. But the opinion may be in- 
correctly formed or based upon such limited experience 
that its value is relative only. To entitle such opinion 
to consideration it is necessary that is should be formed 
upon a wide body of actual facts, and not upon mere 
prejudices or assumptions. Even police returns may 
vary on account of alteration in law, custom, or standard 
of drunkenness. It appears that 28-30 per cent, of the 
total number of offences due to drunkenness are committed 
by women. In 1875, in the Metropolitan Police area, 
47 per cent, of the total number of arrests for drunkenness 
were women, and in 1898 this had fallen to 39 per cent. 
In Manchester (1872-76) the percentage of female arrests 
was 29 per cent, which steadily rose to 37 in 1895. In 
Liverpool there has been a decline from 26 per cent, 
in 1876-80 to 24 per cent, in 1891-95.2 In a similar 

1 Inebriety or Narcomania (1894), pp. 158-159. 

" These numbers of prosecutions for offences of drunkenness, as I have 
pointed out on more than one occasion, do not form a reliable measure of 
the vice of intemperance. It may be that intemperance among women is 
on the increase, as is so generally suggested, but that is a question beyond 
the scope of police statistics, and I feel bound to point out that offences of 
drunkenness by women are not on the increase. 

" Public opinion is being increasingly directed to the deplorable amount 
of drinking by women, and it is quite possible that the extra light thrown 
upon a long-existent evil has produced the idea that it is a growing one. 
Whether it is a growing one or not, it is an enormous one ; and it is to be 
hoped that something can be done to save the homes of the working 
classes from the harm done by the women starting out to drink with each 
other as soon as they have seen their husbands off to work " (extract from 
Report on Police Establishment and the State of Crime, Liverpool, 1905). 



DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 205 

period there has been a slight rise (30 to 32 per cent.) in 
Glasgow, and also in Belfast from 1891 to 1897 (29 to 
30 per cent). In Dundee from 1857-61 the percentage 
of female arrests for drunkenness was 35. It fell to 31 
in 1877-81, and rose to 38 in I892-96. 1 It is evident that 
there are local variations, and for reasons already stated 
such returns do not guide us accurately. 

Another means of estimating the matter is by the 
death rates from alcoholism among women. In the 
Appendix (p. 341) will be found a table comparing 
the death rates per million quoted from the annual 
reports of the Registrar-General. This shows that in 
1875 the death rate per million from alcoholism and 
delirium tremens among males was 73 and among females 
24 ; in 1904 these figures had increased respectively to 
85 and 55. If the quinquennial periods be taken (1875-9 
and 1900-1904) the rate per million in males rose from 65 
to 105, an increase of 61-5 per cent, and that for females 
from 25 to 71, an increase of 184 per cent. This change 
is so marked, and throughout the thirty years the rise 
is so steady, that it would seem to present a more satis- 
factory basis for opinion than police returns. But here 
also there are fallacies dependent upon medical diagnosis, 
certification, and custom, and upon the disease-producing 
effect of alcoholic beverages, which is by no means a 
constant quantity. On the whole, however, and after 
making allowances, they probably indicate the direction 
in which things are tending, namely, to increasing fatality, 
particularly among women. 

In giving evidence before the Interdepartmental Com- 
mittee on Physical Deterioration, Sir Charles Cameron 
and Sir L. Ormsby stated that in Dublin, in their opinion, 
the drinking of alcohol among women was increasing.

A. Sherwell, seventh edition (1900), pp. 85-87 and 677-679. 



206 INFANT MORTALITY 

Dr. Eichholz, Dr. Jones, and other witnesses spoke to 
a similar increase among women in England, and Dr. 
Scott believed the same was true of Glasgow. Of the 
women admitted to the Claybury Asylum in 1903 
suffering from alcoholic insanity 80 per cent, were 
married, and many had families dependent upon them. 

Mr. Charles Booth, in his inquiry into the life of the 
people of London, collected evidence from a variety of 
persons, most of which went to show increased frequenting 
of the public-house by women. 

" As regards women : ' Many more women are seen in public- 
houses; the middle-aged are the drunkards, not the young. 
Young people do their courting in public -houses, since both sides 
are rather ashamed of their homes, and like to make themselves 
out a class above what they are. The young men treat the girls 
to a glass of wine. No harm comes of it. It is not till they get 
older that women take to gin and ale and become regular soakers.' 
Again : ' Girls begin when they first go out " keeping company " ; 
neither sex become confirmed soakers before twenty-five or thirty, 
or with women till after marriage. The drunkards are probably 
married women.' Another police officer said, ' Drunkenness 
among women is on the increase,' but added that he had never 
seen a girl under fifteen drunk, and that it was never common 
before marriage. 'They take too much at times, but are sur- 
prised at their own state. They do not drink for drinking's sake, 
and very little upsets them, especially on an empty stomach. 
That is why so many are noisy on Saturday, when they are paid 
and let out early, having had no lunch. They take a nip and 
become hilarious in no time.' And another says : ' Factory girls 
drink, but it is more often the young married women and the 
middle-aged who indulge too much. Men drink beer ; women 
more often spirits. Women drink more than they used to, 
perhaps because they earn more.' 

' There are various classes of women drinkers : the factory 
girl who drinks once in a way, the prostitute who drinks 
in the course of business and very seldom gets drunk, the 



DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 207 

laundry-woman who drinks by reason of the thirsty nature of 
her trade, and the married woman who drinks because her 
husband drinks.' ' Women have lost all shame of entering a 
public-house, and as they never drink singly, the evil spreads.' 
' Public-houses are more attractive than they were ; ladies' saloon 
bars are to be seen everywhere. Publicans tell you that it is in 
response to a demand, but it is difficult to distinguish between 
cause and effect.' Such are other police opinions. 

"The clergy of the Church of England, Nonconformist 
ministers, and schoolmasters may be quoted to the same effect, 
though perhaps in some cases with more of a teetotal bias, or 
with less sense of proportion. That ' drinking has increased 
enormously among women ' is heard again and again, very rarely 
anything to mitigate this opinion, only that it is added, ' Young 
women do not get drunk, unless on bank holidays or at marriages 
or funerals.' ' Drink worse than ever,' we are told, ' especially 
amongst women ' ; and this it is felt is ' a funny thing in face of 
all the agencies.' 'Women drink to excess more than men. 
They take to it largely to carry them through their work.' And 
again : ' The women are worse than the men, but their drinking 
is largely due to their slavery at the wash-tub.' Of the same 
class it is said, 'Nearly all get drunk on Monday. They say, 
" We have our fling ; we like to have a little fuddle on Monday." ' 
And of a yet lower class we hear that they ' live on four-ale and 
fried fish.' 

" The master of a poor school speaks of the habit of drinking 
among the women being very general ; ' even quite respectable 
mothers, when they come to see him in the morning, nearly 
always smell of drink.' Two other masters also mention the 
large proportion of mothers who smell of beer when they come 
to see them at the schools ; while a schoolmistress, ' judging from 
the women who come to see her, infers that nearly all have a 
morning dram.' 'The poorest and most destitute seem,' she 
says, ' to look upon drink as the first necessity of life.' A board- 
school teacher at school in a poor neighbourhood says that the 
attendance is worst early in the week, while the public-houses are 
full of women ; ' the children being at home while the mothers 
drink.' 

" The increase of the habit among women still applies as we 



208 INFANT MORTALITY 

pass slightly upwards in the social scale. It is said to be ' the 
regular thing for women to go in and have a drink when shop- 
ping ' ; and another witness notices the ' marked increase ' in the 
number of respectably dressed young women who drink.' They 
may be respectable as well as respectably dressed. One of the 
East End clergy told how a woman who had been talking to him 
on the subject said, ' when she was young no one would have 
dreamt of going inside a public-house. But things have altered. 
Her son is engaged, and the girl goes with him there sometimes. 
In earlier years you would have put her down as not respectable, 
but not so now.' A member of an Anglican Sisterhood put it 
that ' the time had long since gone by for regarding it as a scandal 
that a woman should drink at a public-house.' And an ' old 
resident,' speaking of the increase of drinking among women, 
says : ' You cannot but see it ; respectable women go into public- 
houses without any compunction, a sort of thing never seen until 
late years.' 

" Amongst the better-to-do, also, drinking is stated to be worse 
than it used to be, ' especially among women.' ' Every doctor 
will tell you that women have acquired the habit of " nipping." ' 
Some (said the witness) accuse grocers' licences, but he did not 
himself attach much importance to them. The real reason was, 
he said, that the women had so little to do. ' All round London 
are growing up suburbs of small houses, whose occupants have 
just enough to live on comfortably. Women left at home ; small 
ailments ; immediate stimulus of drink ; that is how it begins.' 
Another agrees that ' the habit of drinking among women is most 
often contracted by young wives whose husbands are away all 
day.' ' Shop-girls who marry find the loneliness in the suburbs 
unbearable after shop life.' Emphasis is also laid by many on 
the increasing amount of secret drinking amongst strictly middle- 
class women, and the taking of morphia and other drugs, as a 
result, perhaps, of home troubles, and medical men are blamed 
for not being careful enough when they prescribe stimulants. 
But the most objectionable drinking is described as being found 
among retired men of the class who have nothing to do, and pass 
their time in going from saloon bar to saloon bar. Thus do 
'city habits lead to disaster.' 

" Of the increased and respectable uses made of public-houses 



DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 209 

by young women we have, as our quotations show, heard much ; 
and it may be noted that the age of limitation, the age at which 
liquor may be supplied to the young, agrees with their natural 
tastes ; indeed, sweets remain in the ascendant for some years 
longer with most young women. Alcohol is seldom any tempta- 
tion to the young, but, nevertheless, the habit may be acquired 
and become a temptation later. It is directly on this account 
and indirectly on others, that legislation has been introduced to 
check the practise of sending children to fetch the drink required 
by their parents." 1 

But the evidence on the matter is not wholly in sup- 
port of the view that alcoholism is increasing among 
women. 

Dr. Arthur Shadwell holds " that so far from women 
having recently taken to frequenting the public-house 
they have never frequented it less." 2 At the same 
time he remarks elsewhere, speaking for England, 
that " we certainly have a class of women already 
numerous and probably increasing who are a source of 
great national weakness. They are ignorant, idle, 
extravagant, and self-indulgent. They neglect their 
children and their homes, they drink and bet, and they 
exist in all ranks of society. The wretched appearance of 
so many working-class homes and children, which con- 
stantly horrifies visitors to this country, is quite as much 
due to this type of woman as to the self-indulgent man 
who matches her. Neither in America nor Germany nor 
in any other country that I have seen do women drink 
and bet as they do here." 3 

Again, according to the " National Drink Bill " 4 the total

expenditure in the United Kingdom in 1905 on distilled 
and fermented liquors was 164,167,941, a decrease of 
4,819,224 on 1904. Indeed, there has been a decrease 
of 21,759,286 during the last six years. The average 
expenditure per head is now 3 153. n|d., and per 
family of five persons 18 193. 9|d. The twelve most 
populous towns spent 38,065,196, or about 23 per cent, 
of the national expenditure on intoxicating liquors in 
1905.1 

I have elsewhere referred to the results of alcoholism in 
women to infants in their charge (see p. 77). To that 
reference it is now only necessary to add two further facts 
which belong more appropriately to this chapter. The 
first is that there is reason to believe that exceptional 
mothers of the more careless class actually give alcohol in 
the form of brandy or spirits to their infants. This has 
evidently been done in some continental countries (see 
p. 236), and possibly to a small extent in this country. 
Here and there one has come across such cases, but they 
are happily few and far between. It is needless to say 
that alcohol is almost absolutely a poison to infants. 
There is no ground for believing that any perceptible por- 
tion of the infant mortality is now due to this cause. On 
the other hand, there is a body of unpleasant figures which 
show that some 500 to 600 infants are " overlain in bed " 
in London every year (584 in 1904). In the country 
generally this form of death claimed 1,899 victims in 1904. 
The Registrar- General discussed the distribution of these 
deaths in his Annual Report for 1890 (p. xvi) and found 
from 2,020 inquests that the occasion of their occurrence 
was as follows : 

1 These figures and the returns of alcoholic mortality (Appendix, p. 341) 
concern recent years only. It should not, however, be forgotten that 
there is reason to believe that alcoholism was more prevalent formerly 
than now (Lecky, Hist, of England in Eighteenth Century (1878), vol. i. 
chap. Jii. p. 478 et seq. ; and Traill, Social England, vol. vi. p. 862 et seq.).

Suffocation in bed occurs mostly amongst the youngest 
infants, is more frequent in winter than in summer, is 
highest in the poorer districts, and usually more than 
twice as high on Saturday night and Sunday morning 
than on any other night in the week. The mother is at 
home, and there is more money in the family exchequer 
than at any other time in the week, so that the cause 
of this distribution of deaths cannot be due to absence of 
mother or shortness of food. It is more probably due to 
neglect or alcoholism. This cause of infant mortality is 
comparatively rare in Germany, owing to less alcoholism 
among women and to the fact that under Section 22 of the 
Penal Code the Public Prosecutor may charge the parents 
for " causing the death by carelessness." * 

(d} BIRTH RATES AND ILLEGITIMACY. 

It is frequently said that one of the causes of a high 
infant mortality is a high birth rate, and that where the 
latter obtains the former occurs. As a matter of fact this 
is by no means always the case. Ireland is an example in 
point. The birth rate is high, one of the highest as 
measured by fertility in Europe, and actually high in 
Dublin, but the infant mortality rate is low, even in 

1 See Brit. Med. Journ., 1903, ii. 1208. 



212 INFANT MORTALITY 

Dublin comparatively low. And there are instances of 
high birth rate and low infant death rate to be found 
elsewhere. But it may be admitted that very frequently 
districts yielding a high birth rate do also yield a high 
infant mortality, but this is due in large measure to the 
fact that the social conditions are favourable to both 
issues. For example, both occur in overcrowded districts, 
where there is a high proportion of people at child- 
bearing ages. It is the facts of social position rather 
than the high birth rate which are the cause of the 
high mortality. 

But to argue that a high birth rate necessitates a high 
infant death rate because there are more infants to die is 
to forget the influence of the birth rate upon the age-con- 
stitution of a population. An exceptionally high birth rate 
in one year out of a series of low birth-rate years might 
have the effect of increasing the number of deaths of 
infants and the total death rate. Dr. Newsholme has 
clearly stated the position in the following words : " It is 
evident," he says, " that if, owing to a high birth rate, there 
is a larger proportion of children in one community than in 
another, and the relative hygienic conditions of the two are 
equal, there will be more deaths of children in the former ; 
and inasmuch as the rate of young children is higher 
than that of all others except the aged, the general death 
rate will be raised. But if the high birth rate be continued 
there will not only be a large proportion of children, but of 
others between 10 and 40 years of age, at which ages a 
low rate of mortality holds ; and this factor counterbalances 
the other and causes a continued high birth rate to be 
associated with a low death rate." x 

The relation, however, between the birth rate and 
infant mortality is of importance for three reasons. 
First, it is evident that however serious a high infant

DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 213 

mortality may be to a State with a high birth rate, it 
assumes increased gravity if the State have a low birth 
rate, for in such event the candle is being burnt at both 
ends. There is a smallness of output in births, and the 
output falls short of survival. If such conditions continue 
the physical life of such a nation is jeopardised. No one 
can read the conclusions of the Royal Commission on the 
Decline of the Birth Rate in New South Wales without 
realising the gravity of such a situation. In this country 
we also have a declining birth rate and a stationary and 
somewhat high infant mortality rate, which react upon 
each other, enhancing their importance to the State. 
" With the maintenance of high rate of natural increase is 
inseparably connected the preservation of infant life. We 
have shown that the defective birth rate is aggravated in 
its effects in reducing the natural increase by an excessive 
death rate among the newly born." J 

Secondly, infant mortality has relation to the birth rate 
of illegitimate children. A child born out of wedlock is 
described as illegitimate. In 1858 there were 66 illegiti- 
mate births in every 1,000 births, since which date there 
has been a steady decline to 39 in 1903. The lowest 
proportions of illegitimate to total births occur in Mon- 
mouthshire, Essex, and Middlesex ; the highest in Norfolk, 
Shropshire, and Herefordshire. Now, whilst there is no 
direct relation between a high illegitimate birth rate and a 
high infant mortality rate as they exist in counties, for the 
reason that there are many other factors affecting the 
question, it is well known that the mortality among ille- 
gitimate infants is much in excess of that of legitimate 
infants. Dr. Tatham drew up for the Interdepartmental 
Committee on Physical Deterioration a table which will be 
found in the Appendix (p. 342), and which puts the whole 
matter clearly both as regards London and certain rural 
1 Roy. Com. on Declining Birth Rate in N.S. Wales, Report, vol. i. p. 53. 



214 INFANT MORTALITY 

counties. From that table it will be seen that in London 
the illegitimate infant mortality is nearly double that of 
the legitimate, and in syphilis, in diarrhoea, and in atrophy 
more than double. 1 Among male infants, indeed, the 
syphilis mortality is ten times greater among the illegiti- 
mate. Prematurity and congenital defects also cause 
excessive mortality among the illegitimate, especially in 
London. Comparison of the figures for London with those 
for the rural counties shows a great excess of mortality 
among illegitimate children in the former area ; for, 
whereas, among legitimate children in London the death 
rates are in excess of those in the country by about one- 
fifth part, among the illegitimate the London rates exceed 
the country rates by more than 50 per cent, among boys 
and by nearly 60 per cent, among girls. 

Farr showed the heavier incidence of death upon illegiti- 
mate children in Glasgow as far back as 1873, vlz -> 2 93 P er 
i, OCXD compared with 154 for legitimate. Hence whilst 
illegitimate births form 4 per cent, of the total births, 
the deaths of illegitimate infants form between 25-30 per 
cent, of the total infant deaths. 

In New South Wales in the years 1895-1902 the infant 
mortality of legitimate children was 98*5 per 1,000 as 
compared with 277-4 for illegitimates, which is two and 
three-quarter times higher. Taking the legitimate infants 
alone, 49' I per 1,000 die during the first three months of 
life as compared with 145-9 per 1,000 of illegitimates, 
which illustrates the fact that the illegitimate infants die 
early as well as from subsequent disease within the twelve 
months. In the second year of life the death rates of 
illegitimates are only one and one-third times higher, and 
in the third year no higher at all than those of the legiti- 

1 The figures are similar for other large towns. In Manchester in the 
decennium 1893-1902 the illegitimate infant mortality was 396-4 per 1,000 
births compared with 178-4 among legitimate infants. 



DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 215 

mate infants. The high returns of illegitimate infant 
mortality in New South Wales are particularly striking 
when it is remembered that the environment of New South 
Wales is so favourable to infant life that it enjoys one of 
the lowest of all national infant mortality rates. 1 

The causes of death in illegitimate infants are the 
causes of death in legitimate infants plus maternal in- 
difference and social and economic disabilities of the 
mothers, the separation of infants from mothers, the secret 
adoption of infants for gain, and various rapid or slow 
forms of infanticide. The chief of these in actual terms 
of disease are diarrhoea, atrophy and inanition, and 
syphilis. 

There is a third way in which infant mortality bears an 
important relation to the birth rate. This concerns the 
causes of a low birth rate. The Royal Commission in 
New South Wales found that there had been a very 
marked decline of birth rate in that country since 1889 
amounting to 2-23 per 1,000, with a definite tendency to 
decline commencing some few years anterior to 1889, and 
followed by a continuous and rapid decline until in 1902 
the total decline had exceeded 10 per 1,000 of the popu- 
lation (from 33-6 in 1871 to 23-3 in 1901). From the 
evidence placed before them, the Commission found that 
the main factor in producing this decline (which is shared 
by all the Australian States and New Zealand) was 
independent of any variation in age constitution of the 
population or of women of conceptive age, independent 
also of physiological tendencies towards lessened fertility 
or variation in marriage or other natural causes. The 
Commission held that the main factor was : " There was a 
diminution in fecundity and fertility in recent years due to 
the deliberate prevention of conception and destruction of 
embryonic life, and to pathological causes consequent upon 

1 See Appendix, p. 343. 



216 INFANT MORTALITY 

the means used and the practices involved therein." * These 
conclusions cannot here be considered, but the reader of 
Chapter IV. will not be slow to understand that what the 
New South Wales Commission calls " preventing concep- 
tion by artificial means" and the marked increase of 
"induced miscarriage" may be operations having per- 
nicious effects upon the life of infancy. In a word, the 
same practices which lower the birth rate tend to raise the 
infant death rate. 



It will thus be seen that domestic and social conditions 
are exerting considerable effect upon the incidence of 
infant mortality. Much of it is no doubt due indirectly 
to unsatisfactory housing conditions. It is now well 
known that " slum " areas yield high death rates. 2 But 

1 Report 1904, vol i. pp. 14-15. The Commission attribute the tendency 
to which reference is made in these words to (a) the idea that want 
of adequate means is a sufficient justification for interference with 
the course of nature, and (b) unwillingness to submit to the strain and 
worry of children ; a dislike of the interference with pleasure and comfort 
involved in child-bearing and child-rearing. Upon this subject Drs. 
Newsholme and T. H. C. Stevenson have recently written a valuable paper 
entitled The Decline of Human Fertility in the United Kingdom and Other 
Countries as Shown by Corrected Birth Rates (Roy. Statistic. Soc., Dec., 
1905), which should be consulted by students of this question. They 
conclude that in the majority of countries for which corrected statistics 
could be calculated, that there has been a great decline in the corrected 
legitimate birth rate, and an even greater decline in the corrected illegiti- 
mate birth rate. The former might be due to an increased number of 
sterile marriages or to smaller families. The authors believe it to be the 
latter, as there is no evidence of decreased fecundity. They therefore 
believe the fall in the birth rate is due to conditions within the control of 
the people, and is a form of social felo de se. In this country rural birth 
rates have declined more than urban birth rates, and among the rich in 
London the prevention of child-bearing appears to be largely practised, 
being probably less so among other classes. 

2 In the Aylesbury Place area (in Finsbury), condemned under the 
Housing of the Working Classes Act, the average annual infant mortality 
for 1895-1899 was 447 per 1,000 births, as compared with 168 for the 
parish in which it was situated, and 165 for London. After its " representa- 
tion," and previous to demolition, this insanitary area grew steadily worse, 
and the infant death rate rose even higher than the enormous figure 
quoted above. (Some Notes on the Housing Question in Finsbury, 1901, 
p. 31, and Report on Health of Finsbury, 1902, p. 134.) 



DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 217 

that this is not merely a simple relation of poor housing 
to the death of infants becomes clear when we turn to the 
infant mortality of certain parts of Scotland and Ireland, 
where crofters and fishermen are living in veritable hovels, 
amid gross forms of insanitation, and overcrowding of 
men and animals. 1 Here the site is frequently badly 
selected, and is damp and polluted ; the crofter's cabin 
itself is dark, damp, and unventilated ; the third com- 
partment is for the cattle ; and the whole is undrained 
and overcrowded. And yet the average infant mortality 
is lower than in any county of England. Subsequently 
we shall discover the cause of this remarkable immunity. 
Here it is only necessary to note that it is not good or bad 
housing of itself which affects the problem. It is the 
results of overcrowding which, in their turn, act as causes 
of infant mortality. 

" Carelessness on the part of mothers is an accompani- 
ment of overcrowding, and to these causes was ascribed 
the high death rate among infants under five years of age 
in certain areas which were the subject of special in- 
vestigation." So concluded the Royal Commission on 
the Housing of the Working Classes. And the Report 
continues : 

" But there is a great deal of suffering among little 
children in overcrowded districts that does not appear 
in the death rate at all. In St. Luke's ophthalmia, locally 
known as the blight, among the young is very prevalent, 
and can be traced to the dark, ill-ventilated, crowded 
rooms in which they live ; there are also found scrofula 
and congenital diseases, very detrimental to the health of 
the children as they grow up. Among adults, too, over- 
crowding causes a vast amount of suffering, which can 
be calculated by no bills of mortality, however accurate. 

1 See, for example, Sixth Report of Local Government Board for Scotland, 
1901, p. 79, and Eighth Report, 1903, p. 65. 



218 INFANT MORTALITY 

Even statistics of actual disease consequent on over- 
crowding would not convey the whole truth as to the loss 
to health caused by it to the labouring classes. Some 
years ago the Board of Health instituted inquiries in the 
low neighbourhoods to see what was the amount of labour 
lost in the year, not by illness, but by sheer exhaustion 
and inability to do work. It was found that upon the 
lowest average every workman or workwoman lost about 
twenty days in the year from simple exhaustion, and the 
wages thus lost would go towards paying an increased 
rent for a better house. . . . That overcrowding lowers 
the general standard, that the people get depressed and 
weary, is the testimony of those who are daily witnesses 
of the lives of the poor. The general deterioration in the 
health of the people is a worse feature of overcrowding 
even than the encouragement by it of infectious disease. 
It has the effect of reducing their stamina, and thus pro- 
ducing consumption and diseases arising from general 
debility of the system, whereby life is shortened. Nothing 
stronger could be said in describing the effect of over- 
crowding than that it is ever more destructive to general 
health than conducive to the spread of epidemic and 
contagious diseases." * And it is this decline in physical 
stamina among an overcrowded population that leads to 
premature birth, to lack of maternal nourishment, and to 
carelessness and degeneration. 

Recently inquiries have been instituted in two typical 
high-mortality towns as to this very point of the influence 
of domestic and social conditions on the death of infants, 
namely, at Preston and at Dundee. Amid many differ- 
ences there is a significant similarity in the two reports. 
We have already quoted the conclusions respecting the 
Committee of Inquiry at Preston. 2 The results of the 

1 Report of Roy. Com. on the Housing of the Working Classes, 1885, p. 14.

DOMESTIC AND SOCIAL CONDITIONS 219 

inquiry in Dundee show that housing is often poor, that 
overcrowding frequently exists, that there is lack of 
ventilation and cleanliness, but the chief emphasis falls 
upon negligence and ignorance. In the three years' 
observations at Dundee young children and infants were 
found left alone or in charge of incapable persons in 207, 
237, and 147 cases respectively, and the two lady health 
visitors sum up their report in these words : 

" The greatest difficulties experienced in our work arises 
from the indifference, thriftlessness, and the intemperance 
of a considerable number of the persons visited. Most of 
the cases of neglect of home and children proceed from 
drunkenness on the part of one or both parents, and from 
a want of knowledge on the part of many women as to 
the judicious spending of .their money on cheap and 
nutritious articles of food. With many of them their 
staple diet is tea, with bread and butter, and from want 
of knowledge or from laziness they do not use many 
cheap or nourishing foodstuffs which require cooking. 
In such cases we do what we can to instruct them in this 
matter. 

" We have been specially struck with the large amount 
of drunkenness which prevails amongst the women of the 
lower classes, especially on Mondays, when we frequently 
find several under the influence of drink congregated in a 
house which is dirty and neglected." J 

It is clear that it is not external environment which 
only, or in fact mainly, affects the problem under con- 
sideration. During the last half-century external environ- 
ment has enormously improved, and the advance has never 
been greater than in the last twenty-five years. 2 Yet

220 INFANT MORTALITY 

infant mortality remains as grave a problem as ever. 
And we shall not, perhaps, be far from the mark if in 
judging of the evil effects of bad housing and of poor 
social conditions we give chief place to the "laziness, 
want of thrift, ignorance of household management, and 
particularly of the choice and preparation of food, filth, 
indifference to parental obligations, and drunkenness," 
which "largely infect adults of both sexes, and press 
with terrible severity upon their children" I " The people 
perish," it has been truly said, " for lack of knowledge."

INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT 

IT has probably become increasingly evident to the 
student of the facts set out in the previous chapters 
that infant mortality is a social problem concerning 
maternity. From questions of occupation and environ- 
ment, even from the question of earth temperatures, we 
must turn in the last instance to the actual feeding and 
management of an infant by its mother. The young of 
all animals are profoundly susceptible to their upbringing. 
The human infant is no exception. Therefore, more than 
any other single agency, infant mortality depends upon 
infant rearing. Ignorance and carelessness as to the 
physical necessities of life may mean little to the adult, 
but they are unpardonable where infancy is concerned, 
and may as likely as not result in death to the new-born 
child. And, expressed bluntly, it is the ignorance and 
carelessness of mothers that directly causes a large pro- 
portion of the infant mortality which sweeps away every 
year in England and Wales alone 120,000 children under 
twelve months of age. This ignorance reveals itself in 
many ways, but chiefly, perhaps, in feeding, uncleanliness, 
and exposure. 1 These influences operate amid every sort 

1 The means of estimating degrees of ignorance are indirect, and depend 
partly upon observation and general experience, and partly upon statistics 
of illiteracy. In the following table will be found the number of married 
women in the forty- two counties of England and Wales counting Wales 
as two who in 1900 wereiunable to sign the marriage register, which fact

of external environment, good, bad, and indifferent. It 
has been found, for example, that in the worst districts 
there are many instances in which parents have success- 
fully reared every member of a large family, whilst side by 
side with these there are numerous examples of death in

Now if we divide the 42 counties equally in relation to their infant mortality 
rates, we shall find that only one of the counties (Hereford) in the first 22 
with the low infant mortality rates has more than 30 per 1,000 illiterate 
married women. This may be a coincidence, and the argument must not 
be pressed too far ; but as a rough test of a relationship between high 
infant mortality rates and ignorance or slackness as indicated by illiteracy, 
it is interesting. It should be added that since 1876-80, when 200 per 1,000 
married women signed the marriage register by mark, the proportion has 
fallen to 37 per 1,000 in 1896-1900, no doubt owing to the increase in 
elementary education. In 1903 the figure was 23. As regards the topo- 
graphical distribution of illiteracy the Registrar- General remarks that while 
the number of illiterate females is generally greater than the number of 
illiterate males in industrial and mining centres, the reverse is the case in 
the agricultural counties. 



INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT 223 

infancy, and the distinction between these families has 
nothing to do with season, and is not wholly one of 
physical condition of parents, or sanitary condition of home, 
or even poverty, but it is a distinction of the amount of 
knowledge and intelligence, attention and care, which the 
mother is able to bestow upon her offspring. This applies 
in all times of the year, and not infrequently operates in a 
family for many years. 

Indeed, if we could place two infants of one mother 
under precisely the same external conditions, good or bad, 
and feed the one by the breast and feed the other on 
artificial foods of various kinds, we should at an early 
stage in the proceedings begin to see a change which 
would be all the more marked the wider the difference in 
the methods and materials ,of feeding. No doubt such 
practical experiments have often occurred, but it is not 
often that it is possible to observe them throughout the 
twelve months. 

Dr. Vivian Poore, however, recorded an interesting 
instance of three infants in one family in good social 
position. 1 Two were hand-fed and the third was breast- 
fed. The differences in weight were as follows :

224 INFANT MORTALITY 

From 1884 to 1886 Dr. Hope, of Liverpool, made an 
investigation into the large proportion of deaths of infants 
from summer diarrhoea, and he reported that " investiga- 
tion proves incontestably that the deaths of infants from 
this cause are closely associated with the method of 
feeding, putrefying food being the medium by which the 
specific poison is commonly introduced. The deaths 
amongst children under three months of age, either wholly 
or partially fed on artificial foods, are fifteen times as great 
as they are amongst an equal number of infants fed upon 
breast milk ; e.g., investigation has tended to prove that, 
out of every 1,000 infants under three months of age, 
naturally fed upon breast milk alone, 20 die of autumnal 
choleraic disease ; but if the same number of infants, at 
the same age, are artificially fed, then, instead of 20 dying, 
as many as 300 will die from this cause." 

The last inquiry of this kind in Liverpool was made in 
1904, twenty years later. During the period extending 
from the last week in July to the first week in October, the 
infant mortality, which had been normal, approximately 
150 per 1,000, rose to 567 per 1,000 during the first week in 
August, and for three weeks it remained at this figure. 
No less than 1,950 houses where deaths had occurred 
were visited, and all the circumstances carefully noted. 
Inquiries elicited all the ordinary phases of the question. 
First, in regard to the weakness and immaturity, 127 came 
under this category, 42 of these having survived but a few 
minutes. Cases of obvious neglect accounted for some 
400, in the great majority of these the parents being 
intemperate. But this leaves a very large margin un- 
accounted for. And here comes the remarkable fact that 
these 1,950 families have, as a whole, been particularly 
unfortunate families in rearing their children. They have 
had between them a total of 8,169 children, but out of that 
total only 4,163 survived. The families, it will be observed, 



INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT 225 

were not abnormally large ones, but the rate of mortality 
amongst them had been actually 490 per 1,000. On 
another occasion in the same city it was found that in 
12 families there had been in all 119 children born alive, 
of whom 98 had died before their first birthday. It is 
instructive that out of so large a number of families visited 
on account of death from infantile diarrhoea, the antecedent 
history should show so great a sacrifice of life. It is 
improbable that any other method of selection would find 
an equal number of families in which the rearing of 
infants had been attended with so much disaster. 1 

The incidence of a high infant mortality upon poor 
districts is, as we have seen, almost a universal experience 
wherever the conditions exist. The overcrowded and 
poverty-stricken districts of' London, the dense popula- 
tions on the banks of the Tyne, or in the huge 
manufacturing towns of the north, Glasgow, Dundee, 
Dublin, the teeming tenements of New York or Chicago 
they all tell the same story with one remarkable excep- 
tion, namely, that where by race or custom it is the 
practice to feed infants by the breast, the infant mortality 
rate drops even though the environment be highly in- 
sanitary. There is the instance of the low infant death 
rates obtaining among Jews, Italians, Scotch and Irish, 
when these races continue, even under adverse circum- 
stances, to feed their infants by the breast. In 1903 I 
made an inquiry for the Royal Commission on Alien 
Immigration into the mortality of Italians in the " Italian 
Quarter " in Finsbury as a result of which it was shown 
that the infant mortality for the Italians in the Quarter 
during 1901-1903 was 140 per 1,000, as compared with 
167 among the English living in the Italian Quarter (in 
1903 there were no deaths of infants among the English; 
the rates for 1901 and 1902 were respectively 259 and 242

per 1,000, as compared with the Italian infant mortality 
for those two years of 106 and I92). 1 These people were 
all living under the same external conditions, but the 
Italian women breast-fed their infants and the English 
did not. 2 

In giving evidence before a Committee of Inquiry into 
the health of the City of Dublin, Dr. Hope, the Medical 
Officer of Liverpool, referring to this racial characteristic, 
stated that in that city they found "that amongst the 
low-class English the loss of infant life is very much in 
excess of what it is amongst the same class of the Irish 
population ; that the Irish infantile mortality is very much 
less, taken all round, than the English ; and the reason for 
this is that the Irish mothers suckle their infants much 
more commonly than English mothers of the same class. 
The English mothers use bottles and artificial foods, which 
give rise to this mortality. The Irish mothers, by suckling 
their infants, give them the proper food at proper tempera- 
ture, the supply being made when wanted, so to speak. It 
is pure, natural, unadulterated, clean, and it contrasts very 
much with the artificial foods given by the English mothers. 
To this we ascribe the lower infantile mortality from zymotic 
diarrhoea among the Irish population in Liverpool." 3 

1 Report on Health of Finsbury, 1903, p. 257. 

" Again, the lowest infant mortality in Manchester occurs in the 
Cheetham Division (91 in 1904), which is largely occupied by those of 
Jewish faith, who, it is true, are temperate and abstemious, but who also as 
a rule suckle their infants. Dr. Milson Rhodes has also drawn attention 
(in the Brit. Med. Jour., 1902, vol. ii. p. 821), to the fact that the same 
experience is met with in New York, where the infant mortality in 
wretched wards in East Side, inhabited by Russian Jews, is lower than for 
all New York (15-9 as compared with 18-5). 

3 Committee of Inquiry into Health of Dublin, 1900, p. 142. It is 
interesting in this connection to recall that the infant mortality rate 
for Ireland is one of the lowest national rates in the world. In Dublin 
even, where the general death rate is high (31-0 in 1894-98, as compared 
with 19*1 in London), the infant mortality rate is 177, as compared with 
London 159, and 33 English towns 171. That is to say, whilst the general 
death rate of Dublin is 39 per cent, above London, the infant mortality 
rate is only 10 per cent above it. 



INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT 227 

One further series of observations may be selected, 
having relation to the fall which occurs in infant mor- 
tality when mothers are compelled to suckle their 
infants. 

The American Civil War broke out in 1861, and in the 
following year the import of cotton to Great Britain fell 
to 524 million Ibs., against 1,257 millions in 1861. The 
war closed in 1865, and trade with America was resumed, 
the imports rising again to 1,377 million Ibs. At the 
crisis of the famine the mills in Lancashire were not 
working more than half time, and in December, 1862, 
247,000 cotton operatives were out of employment, and 
165,000 others only partially employed. Twenty-four per 
cent, of the total population in the affected districts were 
in receipt of charitable relief; The result of the privation 
existing was an increase in the general death rate, whereas 
the infant mortality rate declined. In Lancashire in 1861 
the infant death rate was 184, but in 1862 it fell to 168, 
rising gradually again to 200 in 1866. In England and 
Wales in the same period it fell to 142 (in 1862), rising 
again to 160 in 1865-66. For Coventry, too, owing to 
trade depression, in 1861 there was a decline in infant 
mortality, which led the Registrar-General to remark that 
" the care of the mothers of Coventry has, it would seem, 
counteracted some of the effects of privation, so that 
neglect of their homes by mothers at work in factories is 
apparently more fatal than starvation." A somewhat 
similar condition of things has been found to prevail at 
Macclesfield when the silk mills are closed or working 
part time. During the siege of Paris (1870-71) also it is 
alleged that while the general mortality was doubled, the 
infant mortality fell 40 per cent. The interpretation of 
these facts is believed to be that in times of trade depres- 
sion the women stop at home, and tend and suckle their 
infants more than in times of prosperity. 



228 INFANT MORTALITY 

These facts may serve as introduction to this branch of 
our subject. They are, however, insufficient for our real 
guidance. What is necessary to elucidate this issue and 
to indicate the directions for reform is something more 
intimate and based upon the most careful inquiry. We 
want to know, in the first place, why it is that the infant 
mortality rates of various countries differ so widely. If it 
be true that infant mortality in the last resort is a matter 
of infant feeding, we require more information on the 
manners and customs of countries where infant mortality 
is low and of others where it is high. We may be sure 
that a problem which concerns most of the States of 
Europe is of a nature which, on investigation, should yield 
useful facts. In casting about for these facts, I came upon 
an old volume of papers read to the Royal Statistical 
Society of London forty years ago. Among these there 
was one by Dr. Farr, in the appendix of which is some 
valuable evidence collected by him on this very point, 
furnished by four writers experienced in their respective 
countries on the matter of infant management. These 
documents we will briefly consider, for they record a 
body of invaluable facts quite impossible to obtain now 
concerning the earlier years of excessive infant mortality 
in Europe. But we want to know also, in the second 
place, what is the actual position and custom as to infant 
feeding in this country where infant mortality is prevalent 
and otherwise. For that also we shall find the most 
carefully prepared evidence at hand. 

I. 

Among the countries of Europe where infant mortality 
is low, Scotland and Norway and Sweden occupy the first 
place. Among countries unenviably affected are France 
and Austria. These four types will serve our purpose. 
In each case the infant mortality rates will be stated, to be

followed by the evidence of four witnesses on the subject 
of infant feeding.

Infant mortality (1879), 108 ; (1883-1892), 120 ; (1893-1902), 127. 

DR. STARK, M.D., F.R.S.E. 

" With all classes it is known to be essential to the 
infant to keep it warm " from the very beginning. " It 
sleeps all night and every night until it is weaned " with 
its mother. In the upper classes it sleeps at night with 
the nurse or "in a cradle in which is a flask of hot 
water." 

" Eighty to 85 per cent, of all children born are suckled 
by their own mothers. ... As a general rule, when the 
mother is healthy, no infant gets spoon-meat till it is 
nine months old or has cut its front teeth. The cutting 
the teeth is generally recognised as the period when it is 
safe to give artificial food ; and the Scotch generally are 
aware that spoon-meat given before that period is ex- 
tremely apt to bring on convulsions. It is generally, 
therefore, withheld till nine months are completed, when 
the child is weaned, though if it be winter the weaning is 
delayed till spring, when the child will be from twelve to 
fourteen months old. It is generally recognised that the 
healthiest children are those weaned at nine months 
complete. Prolonged nursing hurts both child and 
mother." 

Dr. Stark then describes the usual habits in regard to 
the management of infancy, and adds, "80 per cent, 
of the children of Scotland, when infants, are rarely taken 
to the open air, unless to the door of the house in the 
mother's arms." " In the manufacturing districts, where 
the mother has to be absent all day at the manufactory, 
preparations of opium and whisky are largely used by the 



230

old women to whom is committed the care of the nursing 
infants, and artificial food is obliged to be given till the 
mother's return." 

Dr. Stark gives a table of comparative causes of death 
in infancy in Scotland and England in 1860 as follows :

The two notable differences are in the percentage of 
deaths to every 100 infants living in convulsions and in 
prematurity. Thus in England 35 infants died per 1,000 
from convulsions as compared with 6 in Scotland ; and 
Dr. Stark, naturally concerned at the benighted condition 
of England, declares that "there is something terribly 
faulty in the present mode of treating infants in England, 
and there is most urgent necessity for something being 
done to arrest this fearful waste of human life, for if the 
English mortality from convulsions were reduced to the 
Scottish standard, 17,000 lives would be annually saved to 
England." Dr. Stark made various investigations into the 
causes of convulsions, and found they were due to irrita- 
tion set up by " spoon-meat." " There cannot be the 
slightest doubt that the very high mortality among nursing 
children in England is that they get spoon-meat far too 



INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT 231 

early in life, before the stomach of the tender babe can 
digest anything but the mother's milk. This is indeed the 
vital difference between the mode of feeding infants in 
Scotland and in England. As a general rule no spoon- 
meat of any kind is given to infants in Scotland until 
nine months from birth are expired, or until the child has 
cut its front teeth. On the other hand, we know it is 
almost the invariable practice in England to give spoon- 
meat of some kind from the third month. At this time 
nature dictates that the child should still be suckled, 
because no teeth are provided, and that very fact indicates 
that no other food but the natural milk will agree. The 
stomach at that tender age cannot digest properly two 
kinds of food ; the consequence is indigestion, terminating 
in convulsions, as the result of giving spoon-meat, and is 
the reason why 35 infants die from convulsions in England 
in every 1,000 living, whereas only 6 die from the same 
cause in Scotland." * 

1 Dr. Stark, Journal of Statistical Society of London, xxix., pp. 13-19, 
1866. Dr. Ross, the Medical Officer of Health for Barvas,a large crofting 
and fishing parish of Lewis, one of the four districts into which the 
island is divided, tells me that when he went there some twenty-one 
years ago the prevailing custom of the mothers was to suckle their infants 
for the first eighteen months or even up to two or three years. Now 
(1906) suckling is seldom prolonged beyond eighteen months and often 
not beyond the first twelve months. Nor is suckling now the invariable 
rule, as it used to be. Twenty years ago many infants were lost every 
year in their first week of life from trismus neonatorum, brought about, 
in the opinion of Dr. Ross, by mismanagement after birth, " the prevailing 
custom being to treat the new-comer first of all to a teaspoonful of cheap 
1 castor oil,' with a little melted butter, and to feed it for the first three 
days with a solution of cheap impure sugar and water, coloured with 
milk. This caused gastro-intestinal disorder and convulsions, and simply 
killed many and ruined the digestive organs of others. Likewise it had 
an injurious effect on the mothers, as a rule, that the infant was not put 
to the breast till the third day." These habits have undergone a change 
for the better in recent years. " It goes without question," the Medical 
Officer adds, " that the deplorable condition of the dwelling-houses leads 
to a large increase in infant mortality here, which is especially noticeable 
in connection with the lung troubles of infants, such as bronchitis, 
pneumonia, &c., and during epidemics of whooping-cough and measles 
in the cold season, December to May." In 1891 the infant mortality in 
Barvas was 117, in 1902, 112, and in 1905, 143. These comparatively high 
returns were due to epidemics of whooping. In non-epidemic years the 
rate averages 74.

PRjFESSOR ASCHONG, of Christiania. 

It is upon the peasant proprietors and labourers that the 
average rate of infant mortality depends. " The diet of 
the children belonging to these classes," says Professor 
Aschong, " is everywhere most simple and frugal. In the 
first year of their life they are suckled by their mother ; 
and in the poorest families it is not uncommon, although 
by no means a general custom, that the mothers continue 
to suckle the child until two or three years old. The 
reason they assign is that it diminishes the number of 
children ; often it is only sheer want that forces them to 
choose this manner of nourishing their children as the 
cheapest. Afterwards the children must partake of the 
common fare potatoes, cakes, and porridge rnade from 
oatmeal, or bigg and coffee generally without sugar." 
Large quantities of milk are consumed. Professor Aschong 
then draws attention to other features which he thinks 
may play a part in producing a low infant mortality, 
namely, a climate with a low temperature, a small urban 
population, only 12-13 P er cent, living in the towns, and 
the majority living in detached farms and cottages rather 
than in villages, wooden houses, and dry soil. 

Dr. Berg, the Director of the Statistical Department, 
adds some notes on the habits as to infancy in Sweden. 
" The rule," he says, " is that the mother in all classes of 
society suckles her infant. Very often the peasant women 



INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT 233 

prolong the suckling two to three years. Only in the 
higher classes and in the towns are wet-nurses employed 
in the case of inability of the mother. A very remarkable 
exception must, however, be noticed. Since the first 
results of our statistics of population have been known in 
the middle of last century, the great mortality among 
infants o-i attracted attention. The rate of mortality 
was higher in the province of Finland named Osterbotten 
than elsewhere, and it was proved that this high rate of 
mortality among infants of the peasant women was owing 
to the custom which prevails of not suckling the babies, 
but suspending a horn filled with sour milk over the cradle 
for their nourishment, as the mothers are obliged to work 
in the fields or woods at a great distance from home. To 
counteract this habit and its deplorable effects a tract 
was published in 1755 On the Nursing of Infants^ and 
distributed amongst the inhabitants. ... At the same 
time a Royal edict prescribed a fine of ten dollars for 
mothers who by neglecting to suckle their babies for 
at least half a year had caused the death of the 
children." 

" Cow-milk together with the mother's is of frequent 
use ; and when the suckling is prolonged to the third year, 
as is very often the case in the country, the babies run 
after the mother, ask her to kneel down, and suckle 
standing before her, they naturally taking also other kinds 
of food." 

" Formerly there was also a bad habit of giving brandy 
to the babies to silence them, through a notion that the 
effect was not injurious." There was a high percentage of 
illegitimate children in Sweden, and it was the custom to 
get the mothers of these children to act as wet-nurses in 
the more well-to-do families. 1

M. LEGOYT, Chief of the Statistical Department in the 
Ministry of Agriculture, Commerce, and Public Works. 

The treatment of infants, he says, continues to be 
deplorable, especially in country districts. The women 
there work in the fields nearly as much as the men, and 
consequently are obliged to be much absent from their 
homes, which not only affects the actual feeding of the 
children but all the domestic arrangements. But this 
does not wholly explain the high infant mortality, which 
is much due to the fact that a very large number of infants 
in the towns are not fed by their mothers. Some are fed 
by wet-nurses, who have given their own milk to their own 
infants and fed the others on a " horrible pap," which sets 
up internal inflammation. "From these inflammations," 
says M. Legoyt, "a great number succumb." Nor are 
they well looked after in other ways, cleanliness and 
necessary change of linen being frequently neglected. 
In case of illness the doctor is not called except as a last 
extremity. Then to these disadvantages of country-bred 
infants there is poor housing accommodation unventilated, 
cold, and damp. There is also much careless exposure of 
infants in cold and wet weather. Not only is there excep- 
tionally little breast-feeding, but even infants which are ill 
continue to be fed, as in the past, on insufficient cow's milk 
and pap, or bad soup and black, hard bread. Mothers of 
these infants either will not or cannot breast-feed their 
children, "because they have not any milk, or because 
they are obliged to go out to work," and in consequence 
the infant is fed on cow's milk. "It is the common experi- 



INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT 235 

ence," says M. Legoyt, " that three-quarters of the infants 
thus fed succumb in a short time." Finally, M. Legoyt 
refers to the large amount of illegitimacy and the frequent 
abandoning of infants as one of the causes of the high 
infant mortality in France in i860. 1

Dr. HERZ, Assistant Physician to the Vienna Foundling 
Institution. 

Wide differences in social position influence the habits 
of the Austrian people in regard to their treatment of 
infancy. " The higher classes follow a more or less 
rational way ; in the lower classes it is very badly done, 
partly on account of ignorance, partly on account of 
poverty." Some difference exists also in the management 
of town children and those in the country. 

In spite of their training, Dr. Herz thinks that the 
midwives are a principal source of many abuses, fibs, and 
superstitions in regard to infancy. "Many hundreds of 
children die annually in this country by the perverse 
means of these female doctors." 

" The majority of our children are suckled, a small part 
of them by their own mothers, a greater part in Vienna 
by wet-nurses. In the better ranks of society it is now a 
common practice for the mother not to suckle her own 
offspring, while of course the wife of the working man is 
prevented from fulfilling this maternal duty by the 
necessity of working for her livelihood out of doors. 
The former hire wet-nurses, the latter feed their babies 

1 Jour, of Statistic. Soc., vol. xxix., 1866, pp. 23-25. 



236 INFANT MORTALITY 

artifically. With regard to wet-nursing we do not send 
our children to the country as they do in Paris and other 
towns in France, but we take the wet-nurses as a kind of 
servant to our house." In the lower classes artificial 
feeding consists of " different stuff, pele-mele" " This 
part of popular knowledge is dreadfully neglected 
amongst the lower ranks, and from my experience I 
must certify that the majority of the diarrhoeas, so 
frequent and so fatal during the first period of life, are 
chiefly caused by the neglect of the elements of hygiene. 
. . . Brandy and strong liquors are much in use, and the 
child, even the youngest one, gets spirits. . . . One of 
the greatest blessings for the lower classes proves to be 
the creches, erected and supported by voluntary subscrip- 
tions in large and industrial towns (of which there are 
eight in Vienna receiving several hundred children daily, 
|d. and id. each). 1 

RUSSIA. Injant Mortality (1883-92), 270 per 1,000; (1890- 
99), 272 per 1,000. Owing in part to the prevalence of early 
marriage among the peasants the birth rate is high, varying from 
30 to 60 or more per 1,000. (In 1903, 48.) The death rate is 
high, sometimes for whole provinces being 45 per 1,000. The 
mortality among children is also exceptionally high, and the 
infant mortality is by far the highest in Europe. In October, 
1905, I received a letter from H.H. General Roopa, the presi- 
dent of the association for collecting statistics about children's 
mortality in Russia, in which he reports that in 50 Governments 
of European Russia, having a population of 94,215,415, there 
die annually 1,196,674 infants under one year of age, 1.858,850 
under five years of age, and 2,190,757 under 15 years. Infant 
mortality is greatest in the Governments of Perm (population 
2,713,987), which in area is the second largest Government in 
European Russia, of Vyatka (population 2,914,344), of Nijni 
Novgorod (population 1,513,318), of Penza, Kaluga, and Sim- 

1 Jour, of Statistic. Soc., vol. xxix., 1866, pp. 26-28.

birsk. In the South-western Governments of Russia, 23 of 
which have a population of 44,106,435, the infant mortality is 
197-3 P er ijooo. The President quotes the following as the 
chief causes of the high infant death rate : (i) Miserable 
hygienic arrangements ; (2) insufficient beds and accommoda- 
tion for children, and therefore resulting bad infant management 
on the part of the mother, coupled with lack of breast-feeding 
because the mother is usually at work ; (3) the ignorance and 
superstition of the masses ; (4) the adulteration of milk in the 
towns ; (5) epidemics of infectious disease; and (6) insufficiency 
of medical aid. 

II. 

The second class of facts concern methods of infant feed- 
ing and their result in England. Three districts, Derby, 
Finsbury, and Brighton, will be taken as types, and the 
county of Dorset has been selected for comparative 
purposes. 

DERBY. 

Dr. Howarth, the Medical Officer of Health for Derby, 
has published the results of an inquiry conducted from 
November, 1900, to November, 1903, with the feeding of 
8,343 infants born in that town with a view of showing the 
proportion which infants' deaths bear to the aggregate 
of children hand-fed and breast-fed. 1 He concludes that 
" the only children exposed to exceptional risk are those 
reared by hand, and born either during the second quarter 
of the year or during the first month of the third quarter." 
The tendency is for these children to succumb to diarrhoea. 
Dr. Howarth's results are so interesting that they must be 
quoted in some detail. He found that the mortality per 
1 ,000 from certain diseases among children who were 
breast-fed or hand-fed, or were at first breast-fed and 
subsequently hand-fed (mixed), was as follows :

In this table it will be seen that in no case did the 
death rate in any class of disease among hand-fed 
children even approximate that recorded among breast- 
fed children. Even bronchitis and pneumonia, and mis- 
cellaneous diseases other than diarrhoea, carried off 12 per 
i ,000 more hand- fed and therefore less resistant children 
than breast-fed. The totals also tell the same story, 
namely, that the infant mortality for hand-fed is three 
times higher than that for breast-fed, although the social

environment and housing conditions were, if anything, 
rather better for the hand-fed. 1 

The next question Dr. Howarth set himself to answer 
was as to the kind of food used in the hand-feeding of 
infants in Derby and the relation it bore, if any, to infant 
mortality. He constructed the following table on this 
issue :

" From this table it will be seen that the lowest death rate was 
among children fed on patent food ' C,' after which children who 

1 " The town of Derby," Dr. Howarth adds, " is neither markedly 
salubrious nor notably unhealthy. Its population is chiefly of the artisan 
class, and numbered 115,000 at the last census. Employments are at 
railway works, foundries, and mills. Trade is fairly constant, without 
violent fluctuations, and on the whole there is less acute poverty than in 
most towns of the same size. The percentage of married women engaged 
in occupation at the census of 1901 was 9-2, as against 13-2 in England 
and Wales. The slums are extremely limited in extent, and overcrowding 
is practically non-existent. The percentage of tenements with less than 
five rooms which were found to be overcrowded was 4-1, as against 12 -o 
for England and Wales, and 11-8 for the aggregate county boroughs. 
The size of the tenements, which practically mean houses in Derby, is 
satisfactory, as 8r8 per cent, are of five rooms and upwards, against 467 
in England and Wales. The town is built on heavy retentive clay, and 
is about 100 feet above the sea-level at the market-place. There are a 
large number of privies and pail-closets, the objectionable influences 
dispersed by which are lessened to some extent by the large open space 
which is required at the rear of all buildings." 



240 INFANT MORTALITY 

were fed on milk-and-water survived in greatest proportion. In 
the aggregate the various patent foods show a death rate of 202 
per 1,000, as compared with 177 for milk-and-water. The com- 
position of these foods is interesting when considered in relation 
to these statistical details ; it shows that very many more children 
survive who are brought up on malted food in which there is no 
starch than on such as contains unconverted starch in marked 
degree, whilst occupying a middle position between the two are 
the various foods prepared from desiccated cows' milk. Patent 
food ' C ' is a farinaceous food in which the whole of the starch 
has been rendered soluble. It contains no fat ; this is supplied 
by the milk used in preparing it. Patent food ' A ' contains no 
starch, and is a very fair imitation of human milk. It approxi- 
mates the composition of dried human milk, but is deficient in 
both proteids and fat. Patent food ' D ' contains starch which 
has not been predigested, and although perhaps even very young 
children can digest a certain amount of starch, it is not a suitable 
food before the period of dentition. It is this class of food 
which forms a large proportion of those classified under ' Various 
patent foods,' and as the results show, they are much less suited 
for children than the other two. 

" Children fed on condensed milk show a very high mortality 
viz., 255 deaths per 1,000 of children so fed and this is not 
surprising. The chief reason is, perhaps, to be found in the 
analyses of these milks. 1 

" Unsweetened whole condensed milk, if no fat has been ex- 
tracted, constitutes as suitable an article as cows' milk from 
which to prepare food for infants, and if care is taken in 
sufficiently diluting it and making suitable additions no serious

objection can be raised against its use, but the fact remains that 
for some reason or other practically none is used for feeding 
infants in this town. Analysis shows that to sweetened con- 
densed milk a large amount of cane-sugar is added, so that if 
this milk is diluted to the proportions necessary to bring the 
proteids and fat to the same standard as average human milk, 
sugar is in excessive proportion. Condensed separated milk 
shows almost the same percentage composition as sweetened 
whole condensed milk, except that the fat is reduced to 2 per 
cent. Such a milk is absolutely unsuited for the food of infants, 
and its continuous use results in slow starvation of the infant. 
The death rate among children reared on bread, rusks, arrow- 
root, and other farinaceous foods is exceedingly high, being 
255 per 1,000. This is only what would be expected." 

Dr. Howarth thinks the high death rate of 177 amongst 
children fed on home modified milk means domestic 
pollution (possibly from privy-middens) and ignorance of 
the mother. He concludes : 

" The deductions which it appears justifiable to draw 
from the mortality observed amongst hand-fed children 
fed on different foods are : that the use of sweetened con- 
densed milk, either whole or skimmed, should be invariably 
discouraged, and whole, unsweetened condensed milk 
should only be permitted when one is satisfied that the 
milk is being used with a proper degree of dilution and 
with the necessary additions as in the case of modified 
cows' milk ; also that since the death rate amongst 
children reared on patent foods is, on the average, higher 
than amongst those fed on diluted cows' milk, every 
attempt should be made to encourage parents to use 
this latter food and to educate them to an appreciation of 
the necessity for the additions to, and the dilution of, cows' 
milk to render it suitable for infants' food. The addition 
of patent foods to the dietary of very young infants is 
unnecessary, sometimes dangerous, and always expensive."

FlNSBURY. 

During the last four years careful inquiry has been 
made in Finsbury into the feeding of all infants dying 
of epidemic diarrhoea (371) with the result that we find 
that 

68, or 1 8*3 per cent, were wholly breast-fed ; 
129, or 347 per cent, were fed wholly or partly on 

artificial foods and milks ; 
174, or 46-8 per cent., were fed wholly or partly on 

cows' milk. 1

But these returns do not guide us as to the degree of 
breast-feeding in living infants at various ages or as 
to the feeding of infants dying of other diseases than 
diarrhoea. Accordingly, in 1905, new-born children (num- 
bering 1,822) were visited in the first trimester. Of these 
it was found that 1,503 (or 8o - 8 per cent) were wholly 
breast-fed ; 177 (or 9-5 per cent) were partly breast-fed 
and partly artificially fed ; 104 (or 5*0 per cent) were 
wholly fed on cows' milk, and 38 (or 2*0 per cent.) 
1 Report on Health of Finsbury, 1905, p. 56.

wholly on condensed milk. 1 Dr. Sandilands carried out 
in Finsbury a similar inquiry in the same year as to the 
feeding of 554 healthy infants at the ninth month, with 
the result that 69 per cent, were found to be fed on human 
milk only. A parallel investigation was made into 374 
infant deaths from all causes, with the result that 35*8 per 
cent, were breast-fed. These findings may be tabulated 
in percentages as follows :

In 139 infant deaths from diarrhoea, forming the subject 
of another inquiry, Dr. Sandilands found that only 22, or 
1 6 per cent., were breast-fed. 

As a result of his inquiries in Finsbury Dr. Sandilands 
showed that the deaths from diarrhcea in breast-fed 
children under three months constituted only 24 per cent, 
of the total, whilst the remaining 76 per cent, were deaths 
in the artificially fed, that is to say, the deaths amongst the 
artificially fed were nearly four times the number that 
ought to have occurred, on the supposition of an average 
distribution of deaths from diarrhcea among infants fed in 

1 If these figures could be accepted as fairly representing the method of 
feeding of all the new-born infants out of which the deaths in the same 
year occurred, it would yield the following result : Of 1,503 breast-fed 
infants 133 (or 8-8 per cent.) died in infancy, while of 319 artificially fed 
201 (or 63-0) died in infancy. 

3 About 2 per cent, of these infants were not fed at all, dying within a 
few hours of birth. 



244 INFANT MORTALITY 

different ways. The same excessive mortality in the hand- 
fed continues up to the ninth month of life. In the last 
three months of the first year of life the diarrhoea mortality 
approximates to the average. The immediate cause of the 
high death rate from diarrhoea among children whose 
mothers do not suckle them is, in part, polluted milk, but 
there are other factors of importance. 

Insufficient nourishment is not, strictly speaking, a cause 
of diarrhoea, but it may well be a potent predisposing 
cause of death from this disease. Whether the food is 
insufficient in quantity or in nutritive power, or whether 
the fault lies in the inability of a child to digest what it is 
given, the same condition of malnutrition will result, and 
ill-nourished children will always succumb rapidly to 
epidemic diarrhoea. The poorer classes in Finsbury dilute 
the condensed milk they give to their infants to an extent 
which makes it deficient in nutritive power, and give both 
condensed and cows' milk in insufficient quantities and in 
a manner totally unsuited to the digestive capacity of their 
children. So that if the pollution of milk is the cause of 
the onset of diarrhoea, it is at least probable that a previous 
condition of malnutrition is as often as not responsible for 
a fatal termination. 

The diminution in the death rate from diarrhoea in the 
artificially fed, after the ninth month, may be due to the 
well-nourished condition of bottle-fed children at this age. 
Sixty per cent, of them have been started in life with six 
months at the breast, and have thus acquired powers of 
resistance which result in the comparatively low mortality 
from which they suffer when they come to be fed on cows' 
milk of doubtful purity. Again, the mortality after the 
ninth month is comparatively high among the breast-fed, 
many of whom obtain insufficient nourishment from the 
milk of mothers who are not equal to the strain of 
lactation. 



INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT 245 

If diarrhoea is excluded, the evil influence of artificial 
feeding, though less marked, is still apparent among other 
causes of death, whence it may be inferred that the de- 
bility of a child deprived of its mother's milk is a very 
real thing, and must be taken as a factor of some im- 
portance in the mortality from diarrhoea and other 
causes. 

It appears that the mortality from diarrhoea amongst 
infants fed on condensed milk is nearly three times the 
average mortality in the first six months, whilst the mor- 
tality amongst those fed on cows' milk is less than twice 
the average. Between the sixth and ninth months con- 
densed milk still gives a higher mortality, but the dis- 
crepancy is less marked. The difference in the two 
mortalities admits of both .the following explanations, 
one that fermentative changes in the condensed milk are 
more deadly than similar changes in cows' milk, and 
the other that children fed on condensed milk are 
virtually starved and consequently ready victims to fatal 
diarrhoea. 

" Further evidence of the unfavourable influence of con- 
densed milk was shown by the deaths from " other causes." 
Between the third and ninth months the deaths from 
other causes in those fed on condensed milk was twice 
the average number, whilst the deaths in those fed on 
cows' milk were, in the first age period, equal to the 
average, in the second period, only slightly above, and 
in the third age period actually below. The enfeebled 
constitution resulting from the use of condensed milk is 
the direct cause of this high mortality in the case of 
wasting diseases, and the indirect cause of the fatal ter- 
mination of other ailments less intimately connected with 
feeding. 

It would thus appear that condensed milk is the worst 
food for infants, that cows' milk greatly increases their 



246 INFANT MORTALITY 

liability to death, and that all artificial feeding is attended 
by a high mortality. Some of the excessive infantile death 
rate in the artificially fed may with fairness be attributed 
to unsound milk, but the essential cause is the deficiency 
in the supply of human milk for which no adequate 
substitute can be devised. 1 

There is one other point of interest connected with 
these Finsbury figures requiring explanation, namely, 
the occurrence of diarrhoea in breast-fed infants. It 
will be seen that as many as 18 per cent, of the infants 
dying of diarrhoea were breast-fed, and this seems 
definitely to indicate that it is by no means wholly or 
only from cows' milk that diarrhceal infection is obtained. 
It is possible that under exceptional circumstances the 
milk of the mother may set up irritation in the alimentary 
canal of the infant, but this may be set aside as not 
furnishing any appreciable contribution to the bills of 
mortality. Moreover, it has been shown that infants fed 
on a properly prepared and sterilised milk may also suffer 
from epidemic diarrhoea. At the Finsbury Infant Milk 
Dep6t, to which reference will be made in the next 
chapter, 18 infants suffered from diarrhoea in 1905, 14 
of them in August. In 5 cases it caused death. It is 
therefore clear that the feeding of infants on modified 
and sterilised milk does not necessarily prevent them 
from having epidemic diarrhoea, particularly in the third 
quarter of the year. The milk in the cases just mentioned 
was consumed direct from the bottle, through a clean teat, 
without a tube. The milk itself was of a high standard 
of purity, was absolutely sterilised, and was modified to 
suit the age of the infant ; and yet with all this care a 
number of these infants contracted epidemic diarrhoea. 
It is impossible to believe they contracted specific in- 
fection from the milk, for the milk could not contain 
1 Report on Health of Finsbury, 1904, pp. 82-86. 



specific infection of any kind. Moreover, if it had con- 
tained such virus more than 16 out of 57 children (in third 
quarter) using it would have contracted the disease, for 
the whole of the milk came from one source and had been 
treated in the same way. It seems probable, therefore, 
that they contracted the disease through some channel 
other than the milk. We carefully inquired into all the 
possible channels, and we came to the conclusion that the 
virus of this disease had gained access to these infants 
through dried dust and dirt, and particularly by the use 
of "comforters," which are india-rubber rings or dummy 
teats, which this class of children, almost without excep- 
tion, suck and chew during their considerable leisure. 
Such " comforters " are dipped in sugary messes or dirty 
milk to give them a palatable taste. They fall on the 
floor and so collect dust. Flies settle upon them. They 
are never cleaned except, perhaps, on a dirty apron. They 
are nearly always moist and warm owing to contact with 
. the child's mouth, and therefore afford an ideal nidus for 
the multiplication and development of germ life. It is, 
of course, almost useless to give a child milk which is free 
from all contamination and infection if between its meals 
it is supplied with a filthy and infected "comforter." 
There can, I think, be little doubt that " comforters " and 
the long tubes of milk-bottles are two sources of much 
disease, and it would be well if they could be entirely 
abolished. 

No doubt there are other means also by which dust 
and dirt obtain this access to infants (see p. 326). In 
any event it is certain that infants fed on breast milk or 
sterilised bottle milk may contract fatal diarrhoea. And 
if milk be thus excluded and the infants are not otherwise 
fed it becomes clear that we must think of a vehicle other 
than food. What is that vehicle ? It cannot yet be said 
that we know. It may be " comforters " or other articles 



248 INFANT MORTALITY 

sucked by the infant, or a mother's dirty fingers rubbed 
on the gums of the infant, or unclean clothing, or the dirty 
handling by a mother wanting in personal cleanliness, or 
dust-laden hands of an infant who has been crawling on 
the floor, or flies or currents of air carrying infective dust 
from filthy refuse-bins, or dry and dusty streets, or the 
surfaces [of an unclean tenement. Evidence is accumu- 
lating to show the pollution of the air of houses by 
infective or injurious dust and dirt being present in the 
houses. Many years ago Cornet demonstrated the 
presence of the tubercle bacillus in the dust of houses, 
and others have proved the same fact. In 1905 Dr. 
M. H. Gordon showed that the air entering and leaving 
the House of Commons contained microbes and par- 
ticulate matter of intestinal origin (from manure) derived 
from Members' boots. 1 If that be so, it is much more 
likely that tenement houses will be affected in the same 
way, and in a greater degree. 

These considerations bring us in a marked way face 
to face with uncleanliness as the channel of infection of 
diarrhoea, and therefore an indirect cause of infant 
mortality. Unclean milk in some cases, unclean articles, 
clothing, or person in other cases, but in both events 
uncleanliness as a primary and essential condition, affect- 
ing milk or other media, is, without doubt, intimately 
related to epidemic diarrhoea. 2 

There remains for mention, finally, one other point in 
connection with our investigations in Finsbury, and that 
is the cause of early weaning. We have no conclusive 
evidence, owing to an absence of previous records, that 
artificial feeding of infants is increasing, though some 
circumstances exist which seem to indicate that such is

only 16 were found to be clean in house and person. Rep. on Health of 
Manchester ; 1904, p. 185. 



INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT 249 

the case. From a series of inquiries made at the Finsbury 
Infant Milk Depot we are able to say, however, what are 
the alleged reasons for artificial feeding. The stated 
reasons were as follows : 



Mothers who had no breast milk or 

whose milk failed at an early date 100 or 56 per cent. 

Mothers who had an insufficiency 

of milk 34. 19

the infant 13 7 

Mother too ill to nurse child ... 9 5 

Infants unable to suckle or other- 
wise defective 6 3 

The mother at work 2 i 

i 80 loo 



From the inquiries made into infant deaths throughout 
Finsbury, we find that these figures are fairly representative 
of reasons for early weaning. It will be seen that 75 per 
cent, of the mothers weaned their infants because they 
were unable to nourish them, owing to insufficiency or 
absence of milk. 1 

BRIGHTON. 

One of the most notable series of inquiries into this ques- 
tion has been that of Dr. Newsholme at Brighton. For some 
years past his annual reports have contained particulars 
of feeding in healthy infants (now amounting to 1,259) and 
in infants dying of epidemic diarrhoea (now amounting to 
121). The chief facts have recently been summarised, 2 
and afford an excellent illustration of the subject under 
consideration. The methods of feeding these two classes

The significance of the facts in this table becomes 
plainer when the different groups are stated as percentages 
of the total (see opposite page). The three main groups 
are shown in larger type, and it is with these that we are 
concerned. 

Assuming that the dead and living infants belong to 
the same class of the population, these figures indicate 
that the number of deaths from epidemic diarrhoea among 
breast-fed infants was not more than one-tenth of the 
number which would have occurred had the deaths from 
diarrhoea been evenly distributed, and no deaths occurred 
among breast-fed infants aged six to nine months. It will

be seen that eight breast-fed infants suffered from diarrhoea, 
which lends support to the view already expressed, that 
milk is not the only vehicle of diarrhceal infection. There 
is some other factor, and that factor is probably playing

These figures correspond closely with what has been 
found in Derby and Finsbury, and indicate that a large 
degree of breast-feeding is being practised, as was found to 
be the case in Finsbury two years ago. It will be seen 
that 88'5 per cent, of the total deaths from diarrhoea were 
in artificially fed infants, and 5 per cent, in part suckled 
and partly fed artificially. It is clear that even partial 
breast-feeding protects in some measure against fatal 
diarrhoea. " Subdividing results of artificial feeding," writes 
Dr. Newsholme, " according to age, it is found that in the 
first trimester the liability to fatal diarrhoea is 8 times, in 
the second 4| times, in the third 4 times, and in the fourth 
trimester 2\ times as great among artificially fed as among 
breast-fed babies." Further, the probability of death from 
diarrhoea is forty-eight times as great among infants fed 
on cows' milk, and ninety-four times as great among infants 
fed on condensed milk as among those which are breast- 
fed. Dr. Newsholme again points out that the evidence 
obtainable is all in support of domestic-infection rather 
than farm-infection of milk. If diarrhceal infection came 
from the farm we should expect three events which we do 
not obtain. First, there would be massive infection in 
epidemic form. Secondly, there would be the ordinary 
characteristics of milk-borne epidemics. 1 Thirdly, there 
would be a higher incidence of fatal diarrhoea among 
infants fed on fresh cows' milk than on condensed milk. 
Not one of these characteristics do we obtain. Instead of 
infection being massive and wide in distribution it is 
" sporadic," discrete, and isolated in distribution. Nor does 
it " follow the milk-cart," or reveal any sign of being what 
is ordinarily looked upon as a milk-borne epidemic of 
disease. Nor do infants fed on fresh cows' milk suffer worse 
than those fed on condensed milk, but on the contrary, the 
reverse is the case. It is the condensed milk-fed infants

INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT 253 

that mostly die from diarrhoea, not because condensed 
milk contains more organisms than fresh cows' milk (for it 
contains less), but in all probability because condensed 
milk is less nutritious and sustaining, and is more liable to 
home contamination than cows' milk. 

Experience of Other Towns. Evidence is now rapidly 
accumulating as to the evil effects of artificial feeding of 
infants. It is undesirable to burden these pages with 
details which would of necessity involve much repetition, 
and it is difficult briefly to tabulate such experiences. 
The following further facts serve, however, to confirm the 
findings in Derby, Finsbury, and Brighton : 

Inquiries have been made at Croydon for several years. In 
1904 63 per cent, (previous inquiry 58) of infants alive at six 
months of age are breast-fed, and of dead infants 42 per cent, 
(previously 45) of these dying from all causes, and only 9 per 
cent, (previously 14) of those dying from diarrhoea T (Richards). 

At Colchester Dr. Savage has shown that 62 per cent, of 
infants under six months, and 60 per cent, of all infants under 
twelve months, are wholly breast-fed. Only 4 per cent, of infants 
were found to be having condensed milk only. The chief cause 
of infant mortality in Colchester is prematurity, congenital con- 
ditions, and atrophy, which constituted 39 per cent, of all infant 
deaths in igos. 2 

At Stockport, in 1904, it was found that of 116 infants dead 
from diarrhoea 95 per cent, were fed wholly or partly by hand. 
Inquiry also showed that out of 977 breast-fed children only 
2 per cent, were " delicate in health," whereas out of 363 artifi- 
cially-fed children 68 per cent, were delicate. 

In Blackburn, in 1904, 85 per cent, of all children under seven 
months of age were nursed and tended by their mothers, but only 
37 per cent, were wholly breast-fed. There were 595 infant 
deaths, of which about 70 per cent, were under six months 
of age.3

254 INFANT MORTALITY 

At Salford, in 1904, 109 infants dying under i year were breast- 
fed, which gave an infant mortality of 128-6 ; the infant death rate 
for children fed on breast milk and other food was 190*4, that 
for children fed on cows' milk only, 263-9 ; and that for infants 
fed on other food (condensed milks, &c.), 439-0 per 1,000 
births. 1 

Mr. Seebohm Rowntree tells me that at York it is very apparent 
that deaths of children under twelve months of age are largely 
due to wrong feeding. Out of 100 deaths it was found that in 
only 1 6 cases had the babies been breast-fed, and in 5 of these 
some addition (generally bread or biscuits) had been admittedly 
made to the mother's milk. Of the 84 artificially-fed babies 39 
died from diarrhoea, 8 from convulsions, and 4 from intestinal 
trouble other than diarrhoea. The remaining deaths were due 
chiefly to wasting or bronchitis. The proportion of children 
receiving natural nourishment in York is about 75 per cent, and 
of the 25 per cent, who are artificially fed a certain number are 
either wholly or partially breast-fed for longer or shorter periods 
in some cases for six months. 

In Birmingham Dr. Robertson calculates that the infant mor- 
tality rate for breast-fed infants is 7 '8 per 1,000 births, for breast- 
fed and otherwise fed children 26*5, and for children having no 
breast milk 252-3. It appears that 86 per cent, of the mothers in 
Birmingham partly or entirely breast-feed their infants. Seventy- 
nine per cent, of infants under six months of age dying in the 
third quarter of 1904 were bottle-fed with tube-bottles, and 21 per 
cent, with boat-bottles. 2 

These three urban districts may be suitably contrasted 
with the county of Dorset, which is characterised by one 
of the lowest county infant death rates in England. In 
1845-54 the infant mortality rate was 123 per 1,000 births. 
It is now 92. In answer to inquiries addressed to the 
local medical officers of health as to the cause of this low 
mortality, I have received ten replies, covering the condi- 
tion of things existing in the greater part of the county.

INFANT FEEDING AND MANAGEMENT 255 

The two chief conditions which are operating favourably 
are the breast-feeding of infants and the absence of factory 
occupation of women. The former is relative, but on the 
whole the usual practice appears to be to nourish infants 
in the natural way " for twelve months or more." As to 
the latter there is, speaking generally, but little occupation 
of married women in factories (only 11*4 per cent, as 
compared with 37*9 in, say, Blackburn). A third con- 
dition upon which there is agreement is the compara- 
tively favourable circumstances obtaining as to housing 
accommodation. Dr. C. H. W. Parkinson of Wimborne, 
who has had a long experience in the county, names also 
the sanitary improvement which has taken place, particu- 
larly the abolition of the old privy system of conservancy, 
and improved land drainage and water supply. He also 
considers that the social life of the people accounts, in 
part, for the low infant death rate. Wages are fair, in 
some districts good, and there are few unemployed. 
" The general habits of the people," he adds, " have 
improved, and there is distinctly less drinking to 
excess." Most of the medical officers remark on the low 
incidence of epidemic diarrhoea, which indeed has been 
characteristic of this county since 1871-80. It is an 
interesting example of a locality where, in spite of a high 
earth temperature in the third quarter of the year, there is 
practically speaking no fatal diarrhoea of infants. This is 
attributed to the custom of breast-feeding and more 
careful infant management. It is also in part due, accord- 
ing to Dr. Carrington of Poole, to a good milk supply. 
Friendly Societies appear to prosper in the district, and 
consequently medical aid is readily obtainable. There is 
comparatively little overcrowding. 

Such being the substantial facts as to infant feeding and 
management, we may attempt a word of summary as to 



256 INFANT MORTALITY 

the position. We have seen that before the child comes 
into the world ante-natal influences have already begun to 
mould its future, and that after its arrival the social and 
physical circumstances of the mother exert a dominating 
effect. The influence of occupation, great in many ways, 
is greatest in its indirect effect on the home environment 
and natural nourishment of the child, and this view is 
abundantly confirmed by a study of epidemic diarrhoea. 
Even the domestic and social conditions are reducible to 
terms of nourishment. 

The present chapter has but added to the cumulative 
evidence as to the absolutely vital importance of suitable 
infant feeding. It is not everything, but it may be said 
that it is a greater factor than any other single thing. 
The problem of infant mortality is after all one of those 
elementary problems which depend more upon instinct 
and the physical faculties and functions which nature has 
provided in the mother than upon external environment. 
It is so with the young of all animals, and the human 
species is not an exception. And so it comes about that 
many of the facts set forth in the preceding pages have 
importance chiefly as they concern a fulfilment of the 
primitive needs of food and warmth and cleanliness. 



IX 
PREVENTIVE METHODS: (l) THE MOTHER 

THIS book will have been written in vain if it does 
not lay the emphasis of this problem upon the vital 
importance to the nation of -its motherhood. Wherever 
we turn, and to whatever issue, in this question of infant 
mortality, we are faced with one all-pervading primary 
need the need of a high standard of physical mother- 
hood. Infant mortality in the early weeks of life is 
evidently due in large measure to the physical conditions 
of the mother, leading to prematurity and debility of the 
infant ; and in the later months of the first year infant 
mortality appears to be due to unsatisfactory feeding of 
the infant. But from either point of view it becomes 
clear that the problem of infant mortality is not one of 
sanitation alone, or housing, or indeed of poverty as such, 
but is mainly a question of motherhood. No doubt external 
conditions as those named are influencing maternity, but 
they are, in the main, affecting the mother, and not the 
child. They exert their influence upon the infant 
indirectly through the mother. Improved sanitation, 
better housing, cheap and good food, domestic education, 
a healthy life of body and mind these are the conditions 
which lead to efficient motherhood from the point of view 
of child-bearing. They exert but an indirect effect on the 



257 



258 INFANT MORTALITY 

child itself, who depends for its life in the first twelve 
months, not upon the State or the municipality, nor yet 
upon this or that system of creche or milk-feeding, but 
upon the health, the intelligence, the devotion and 
maternal instinct of the mother. And if we would solve 
the great problem of infant mortality, it would appear 
that we must first obtain a higher standard of physical 
motherhood. 

Without a moment's hesitation, I place this need as the 
first requirement. Other things, as we have seen, are 
important, but this is the chief thing. And, therefore, in 
the consideration of any measures for reducing the infant 
mortality, we must first attempt to solve the problem 
through the mother. 

I. THE REORGANISATION OF EXISTING AGENCIES. 

There are in England a variety of charitable agencies 
which have for their ostensible purpose the assistance of 
mothers of the poor at the time of childbirth. Some of 
these are of an antiquated character, and their funds are 
being spent in a way which would not commend itself to 
their benefactors. Others are too small in scope and too 
little known to be of any material assistance in a problem 
so great ; and both kinds are worked too greatly on a 
basis of " charity " rather than a basis of insurance. In 
view of what is being done in this country and America 
in ordinary life and accident assurance, and in Germany 
in the workmen's insurance, it is somewhat remarkable 
that no substantial organisation exists in England for the 
assistance and counsel of married women before, during, 
and after confinement. Yet no one can consider the facts 
as to the occurrence of infant mortality in industrial 
districts without perceiving that it is the occupation of 
women in factories and workshops up to the time of 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 259 

confinement, and the early return to work after confine- 
ment, which not only prejudices the prospects of the child 
before birth, but deprives it of the necessary nursing and 
tending after birth. By far the chief incidence of mor- 
tality falls on the infants of the working women who are 
thus compelled by their poverty or other circumstances, 
but almost invariably poverty, to deprive their offspring 
of even a fair chance of survival. In Germany a remedy 
has been found in a maternity fund, to which both 
employers and employed contribute, so that when the 
time of childbirth arrives the working mother receives a 
sum of money weekly, and on that account need not 
return to work at such an early date as formerly. No 
doubt this is good for the mother, but it is of even greater 
advantage to the child. In France there exists a Society 
for Nursing Mothers, which has been established since 
1876, and is recognised by the Government. The idea 
of preserving the mother's health for the sake of the child 
has prompted this piece of work. It is divided into two 
branches before birth and after birth. The former branch 
consists of homes where destitute mothers are received for 
the last few weeks before the birth of their child. They 
are fed and cared for, until the time comes for them to be 
passed on to a maternity hospital and thence out into the 
world again. From the time the first refuge was opened, 
in 1892, until the end of 1904, nearly 10,000 future mothers 
were sheltered ; 3,902 of them were married women whose 
husbands were either away or ill, or had disappeared 
altogether, 922 had recently become widows, and 4,442 
were unmarried and abandoned. The result of the receiv- 
ing homes has been that no woman from these institutions 
has yet died in childbirth. Professor Pinard, in his report 
to the Academy of Medicine, said, " The children of our 
refugees are born in the best conditions of health and 
vigour ; they always exceed the average weight, and are 



260 INFANT MORTALITY 

remarkably developed." z The second part of the work is 
maintenance or part maintenance of mothers during the 
first year of their infants' life, so that they may be free to 
nourish them from their own breast. For this purpose 
relief bureaux and dispensaries have been opened. Each 
woman is put under a lady patroness who knows about 
her, administers the allowance granted by the committee, 
and watches over her welfare, moral and material. A 
doctor visits also. Each month the child is undressed, 
weighed, carefully examined, and medically treated if 
necessary. In this way 39,119 children have been 
watched over since the beginning of the society in 1877. 

But this is by no means all that can be done. A 
mother suckling her infant requires nourishment, and it 
is lack of nourished mothers among the poor many of 
whom are half-starved that leads to the inability to pro- 
vide milk for their offspring. This, in its turn, leads to 
early weaning, which involves artificial feeding, which is 
one of the most difficult undertakings in the tenement 
homes of the poor. And so it comes about that the early- 
weaned infant is so often marked for death in infancy. 
The solution in some cases is undoubtedly a suitably 
modified milk for the infant, but in many other cases the 
solution, if we would but understand so simple a proposi- 
tion, is to feed the mother. 

This is now being done in prance, where M. and Mme. 
Coullett have discovered that for less than the price of 
sterilised milk for the infant it is possible to give a meal 
to both mother and child. Instead of staking everything 
upon the provision of proper food for hand-fed infants 
these pioneers have gone one step nearer to the founda- 
tion of things by giving two good meals a day to nursing 

1 A somewhat similar movement exists among the Jews in East London 
known as the Sick Room Helps Society, which provides personal help in 
the homes of poor Jewish women at the time of confinement. 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 261 

mothers. Mme. Coullett's five restaurants in Paris are 
simple and homely. As little as possible is spent in 
rent, furniture, and accessories. They are situated in 
the poorer quarters, near to the homes of the mothers 
needing them. As a new neighbourhood is investigated, 
and as funds come in, a fresh dining-room is opened. The 
experiment has just been made at one centre of having 
the catering and cooking done by the serving woman. 
The meat is bought cheap at the meat market, the 
vegetables are collected from the shops in the cheapest 
streets, and the cost of each meal works out at 2d. per 
head. Beer is served to the women only when it is pre- 
sented. Presents of beer, meat, fruit, barley, rice, and 
even tables, chairs, and pictures, are often made by 
sympathisers. 

The principle on which the women are admitted to 
these meals is considered a distinguishing feature of the 
charity. No questions are asked. Are they married, are 
they single, are they Protestant or Catholic, are they rich, 
are they poor, who are they, where do they live ? none of 
these things need be said. " They are mothers, they are 
hungry that is enough." 

The notice of announcement states that " women nursing 
their children at the breast can be fed here gratis, in the 
morning from n to I, and in the evening from 5.30 to 7." 
Each mother is supplied with a large cup of broth, some 
meat, bread, and a glass of light beer, if such is presented. 
The charity is supported by private munificence, but the 
State and the municipality are, it is understood, also giving 
their support. The first of the Coullett restaurants was 
opened in November, 1904, and since that time some 70,000 
meals have been given to these nursing mothers. It is 
not, of course, to be supposed that institutions of this 
kind will serve a useful purpose in all countries, and it 
is obvious that careful supervision is necessary to prevent 



262 INFANT MORTALITY 

abuse. But the fact remains that the nourishment of the 
mother is along the main line of reform. 

II. EDUCATION OF THE MOTHER AS TO INFANT 
MANAGEMENT. 

"Nothing seems to be wanting," writes the Medical 
Officer of Burnley, " but a department to teach the 
burgesses common sense, mothers how to feed a child till 
its teeth come, and how to nurse it when it is poorly." * 
Few facts receive more unanimous support from those 
in intimate touch with this question than the ignorance 
and carelessness of mothers in respect of infant manage- 
ment. Such ignorance shows itself not only in bad 
methods of artificial feeding, but in the exposure of the 
child to all sorts of injurious influences, and to uncleanly 
management and negligence. Death in infancy is pro- 
bably more due to such ignorance and negligence than to 
almost any other cause, as becomes evident when we 
remember that epidemic diarrhoea, convulsions, debility, 
and atrophy, which are among the most common causes 
of death, are brought about in large measure owing to 
improper feeding or ill-timed weaning ; bronchitis and 
pneumonia are due not infrequently to careless exposure 
(indoor or outdoor); 2 and death from measles and whoop- 
ing-cough is largely caused by mismanagement of nursing. 
To remedy this condition of things three different measures 
need to be carried out : (a) instruction of mothers, (b~) the 
appointment of lady health visitors, and (c) the education 
of girls in domestic hygiene. 

(a) It is now the usual practice in large towns for the 
Sanitary Authority to issue leaflets of instructions either

2 In a London market street on a raw, cold, foggy night in November 
(1904), between the hours of 9 and 10, I have counted 67 infants in arms. 
A month later 66 were counted by another observer in the same street at 
the same time of night. (Report on Health ofFinsbnry, 1904, p. 263.) 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 263 

through the birth registrars or through sanitary inspectors, 
or other visitors to the mothers of new-born infants. 
There is an almost infinite variety of these, some of 
which are too long and elaborate to be of service in the 
direction needed. A fairly good example of the shorter 
form of leaflet, which has the advantage of having been 
approved by two large London hospitals, will be found in 
the Appendix (p. 344). 

A fuller and more adequate statement is that known as 
" The Elementary Counsels to Mothers and Nurses," edited 
by the Commission of the French Academy of Medicine 
on the Hygiene of Infancy (see Appendix, p. 346). 

(b*) Lady Health Visitors. Some thirty-five or forty of 
the large towns now employ Lady Health Visitors to visit 
the homes of the poor where births have occurred and to 
give advice as to rearing of children. In other towns these 
duties are undertaken in greater or less degree by the 
Lady Sanitary Inspectors, whose duties, strictly, are con- 
fined to matters which concern the external environment, 
such as sanitation of premises and workshops, investigation 
of infectious diseases, &c. In his annual report on the 
health of the county of Warwick for 1903, Professor 
Bostock Hill makes the difference clear: 

"It must not be thought the work of the health visitor 
trenches in any way on the duties of the sanitary inspector, 
or indeed any members of his staff. She is not an inspec- 
tor in any sense of the word. Her functions are rather 
those of friend of the household to which she gains access, 
and it is very gratifying to know that although at first 
there may have been some opposition to her entering a 
house, this rapidly died away, and in numerous instances 
she has been asked to return and aid the mothers of 
families by her help and counsel. ... In this new depar- 
ture of carrying sanitation into the home I believe we have 
not only an important but almost the only means of further 



264 INFANT MORTALITY 

improving the health of the people. Sanitary authorities 
by providing water supply, drainage, and decent houses, 
have done much. In the future, however, the most impor- 
tant advance will come from an appreciation by the people 
themselves of the value of good health." 

The qualifications required for a Lady Health Visitor 
are of a high character. The mere qualification of training 
is, of course, essential, but qualification by character and 
by natural gifts is equally necessary. Such an officer should 
be a trained hospital nurse if possible, and should hold a 
sanitary inspector's certificate. But in addition to such 
training, it is of the greatest importance that these women 
should have insight and tact, so that they will not only 
refrain from giving offence in their somewhat delicate 
duties, but they will actually by their sympathetic and 
tactful bearing gain the confidence, and even the friend- 
ship, of the parents whom it is especially sought to influence 
by their ministrations. At Huddersfield two lady doctors 
are engaged in the service of the Corporation in this task 
of visiting, and when possible there can be no doubt that 
medical visitors are the most suitably qualified of all. But 
even medical qualification requires the addition of the 
sympathy and tactfulness above mentioned. The scheme 
of visitation at Huddersfield, which is partially official and 
partially voluntary, and which came into full operation in 
1906, is carried out as follows : The borough is divided into 
nine districts, from which births are notified to the Medical 
Officer of Health (on a voluntary system of payment of one 
shilling for each birth notified within twenty-four hours of 
its occurrence). Each of these nine districts has a voluntary 
worker known as a " Lady Superintendent," who is assisted 
by voluntary lady-helpers, and these various voluntary 
workers are supervised by two lady doctors appointed by 
the Corporation, who, of course, work under the Medical 
Officer of Health. The newly-born children are visited as 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 265 

soon as possible by the lady doctors, who give suitable 
advice and leave copies of the short or extended advice. 
Each Saturday a list of the cases in her district is sent to a 
Lady Superintendent, who distributes the cases among her 
Lady Helpers. These keep the cases under observation, 
and, where it appears necessary, invoke the aid of the 
Department. Great care is exercised to avoid touching 
upon the domain of the family doctor, and also to avoid 
any action which even might have the appearance of 
diminishing parental, and particularly maternal responsi- 
bility. 1 

In the Longwood district of Huddersfield from Novem- 
ber, 1904, to November, 1905, a promise was made by the 
Mayor of the town (Mr. Broadbent) to pay i as a birth- 
day present to each baby bdrn in the district on its com- 
pleting its first year of life. The mere promise was, 
however, only part of the plan. The promise was made by 
means of a legally drawn promissory note printed on a 
card, on which was also given as much condensed good 
counsel as could be compressed into the space. The 
really effective " working part " of the scheme was a small 
committee of ladies. By means of the card the ladies 
obtained an introduction to the homes and paid visits 
periodically as occasion offered, helping the mothers with 
advice and sympathy. On various occasions, such as 
Christmas and Easter, little remembrances were sent to 
the individual babies, and at the commencement of the 
diarrhoea season and at the onset of cold weather short 
personal letters of advice as to the precautions needful 
were sent to each mother through the post. 

It should be added that Longwood, though absorbed, 
is by no means merged in Huddersfield, but still keeps 
up a certain separateness and individuality. The popu- 
lation is 5,359 and the acreage 1,334; i ts height above

sea-level varies from 150 feet to 1,200 feet; there is 
no congested population, there are no slums ; portions of 
the area are really urban, whilst other parts are almost 
purely agricultural. By far the greater part of the popu- 
lation, male and female, are factory workers engaged in 
the manufacture of woollen goods, with a sprinkling of 
quarrymen, masons, labourers, and small farmers. It is, 
however, to be noted that a comparatively small number 
of married women go out to work ; there is a strong public 
opinion against this in the village. The death rate for ten 
years has averaged 13*44 and the birth rate 19*39, while the 
infantile mortality figure has been 122 per 1,000 births. 
The infant mortality during the year in question showed 
marked reduction. 

(c) The Education of Girls in Domestic Hygiene, Among 
the conditions of modern town life tending to raise the 
infant mortality are the employment of married women 
as breadwinners for the family, and the comparative failure 
to educate girls in the elementary schools in matters of 
domestic hygiene. Attendance at school is now com- 
pulsory, and thus girls are deprived of much of the 
home-training they formerly received, and yet this serious 
loss is not made up to them by any similar instruction at 
school. It cannot be doubted that this has exerted an 
unfavourable effect in the home management of infants, 
and the only way to counteract it is to instruct and educate 
the elder girls in all elementary schools in these matters. 

"Whatever else girls may or may not be taught," writes Dr. 
Niven, "it should be absolutely compulsory on them to get a 
thorough grounding in certain domestic branches of knowledge 
before leaving school, and they should not be allowed, gene- 
rally speaking, to leave school until they can show a competent 
acquaintance with those branches, unless provision is made for 
their subsequent education. A girl should know how to cook a 
variety of common articles of food, and to sew and mend. She 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 267 

should know also how to clean a house, and when a house can 
be regarded as clean. She should be taught the dangers to 
health arising from filth. The course should comprise the 
properties and prices of suitable food. She should learn how 
to clean, manage, and feed infants and young children. She 
should also know something about infectious diseases, their 
dangers, and how to act when they occur. All boys and girls 
should be taught the elementary principles of personal hygiene. 
"The knowledge embraced in the course which I have 
sketched should be intimate and practical. Such a course as 
the above should be regarded as the necessary feature of a girl's 
education, and nothing should be permitted to displace it." 1 

It is evident that in order to conduct such studies it will 
be necessary also for the teachers to become qualified by 
special training in the elementary principles and practice 
of hygiene and infant management. 

In 1905 the Board of Education issued "Suggestions 
for the Consideration of Teachers" of public elementary 
schools. 2 This admirable memorandum (which extends 
to some 150 pp.) contains, unfortunately, very little 
reference to the importance of teaching domestic hygiene, 
which is only suggested incidentally. The Board Memo- 
randum states that : 

"A course of instruction in hygiene should form part of the 
work for the two highest classes of every girls' school. Such 
instruction will naturally be included in a course of household 
management ; and if that subject is not taken the lessons on 
common things should include a few lessons applicable to the 
home circumstances of the scholars, dealing in an absolutely 
non-technical way with questions of feeding, clothing, rest, air, 
light, warmth, exercise, cleanliness, and the general care of 
health. In some cases it will be well to include some instruction

laundry work, and housewifery will be of very little value unless 
it bears some relation to the actual needs of the children in 
their own homes. Some simple ambulance lessons may also be 
included in the course. 

" It is most desirable that every scheme of instruction for older 
children should include a short series of lessons enjoining tem- 
perance as regards the use of alcoholic beverages and stimulants. 

" Such lessons, like those suggested above on hygiene, need 
not be grouped under a new separate head of the curriculum, but 
can be included among the lessons given in elementary science, 
knowledge of common things, cookery or household manage- 
ment, as may be most suitable in the particular circumstances. 
Some of the important points can be reasoned out, but others 
cannot he satisfactorily dealt with in this way, and must therefore 
be didactically impressed on the children by an appeal to the 
testimony of experience and to the authority of trained investi- 
gators of such matters. Sensational lessons, illustrated by physio- 
logical diagrams, or by exciting descriptions of the unhappy effects 
of drunkenness on society or the individual, are as likely to do 
harm as to do good. 

" The purpose of the instruction given on this difficult topic 
should be to make the children understand that health and 
happiness are sure to be impaired if strictly temperate use is not 
made of food and drink." 

The Appendix of the memorandum contains an outline 
scheme for teaching hygiene and temperance, which deals 
in elementary fashion with the home, the person, eating 
and drinking, fresh air, sunshine, cleanliness, &c. All this 
is very appropriate and suitable, but has little to do with 
infant management. What is needed is a training in those 
arts of domestic management of which compulsory edu- 
cation has deprived the girls of the artisan classes. There 
are, no doubt, difficulties and there is expense; but this 
kind of instruction is now absolutely essential if we would 
have young women in the next generation not so ignorant 
as many of the young married women are to-day.

III. As TO THE OCCUPATION OF THE MOTHER. 

However much the employment of married women is 
open to criticism, the fact of their employment remains, 
and appears under present circumstances to be, in many 
cases at least, a necessary evil. Hence the immediately 
practicable measures must be applied rather to the pro- 
tection and relief of such women than to any attempt at 
prohibition. Short of that there are three directions in 
which more should be done to reduce to a minimum the 
grave disadvantages to infancy of such occupation. First, 
there is needed amendment of Section 61 of the Factory 
Act ; secondly, a more uniform enforcement of factory 
sanitation ; and thirdly, the establishment and control of 
creches, 

In Section 61 of the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, 
it is required that an occupier of a factory shall not 
knowingly allow a woman to be employed in his factory 
or workshop within four weeks of childbirth. Some 
authorities recommend that this period should be ex- 
tended, say, to three months ; others advise that a similar 
period of a month should be fixed before confinement as 
well as after. No doubt these are in every way desirable 
limitations, but not perhaps so practical as they may 
appear at first sight. Still, in this respect, as in many 
others, England is behind the best European practice. 1 

As we have seen, the law in Switzerland has been ex- 
tended to a total period of eight weeks before and after 
confinement, which, in the opinion of M. Schuler, an 

1 "The nation must set its face against the employment of married 
women in factories or workshops, and gradually extend the period of 
legal prohibition. There is only one proper sphere of work for the 
married woman, and that is her own home. In the case of factory 
workers, the employer must be made to furnish a maternity fund if he 
wishes to employ married women. Thus penalised he will probably 
prefer not to employ them, to the very great advantage of the labour 
market and the nation." (Riches and Poverty, L. G. Chiozza Money, M.P., 
1905, p. 169.) 



270 INFANT MORTALITY 

inspector of factories in Switzerland, has had a beneficial 
effect in adding both to the weight of the infants born 
and to their survival. In Germany and Austria the 
existence of a compulsory system of workmen's insurance 
renders the carrying out of such regulations comparatively 
easy. In Germany the working woman who, owing to 
child-birth, is compelled to abstain from industrial labour 
receives, in addition to gratuitous medical assistance, a 
sum equal to half her ordinary daily wage. Compensation 
must, it would seem, accompany any extension of the pre- 
sent period of the one month (as is practised at Creusot). 

Short of any such radical change there are three 
amendments of this section which seem practicable, 
namely, the omission of the word " knowingly," the intro- 
duction of medical certificates, and a provision against 
employment within the month by a fresh employer. It 
has been found in practice that the word "knowingly" 
suggests an adequate defence for culpable negligence, so 
that it is extremely difficult in many cases to bring home 
the responsibility of such employment to the actual 
offending manager or foreman. Then, again, it would 
be a step in the right direction if re-employment at, 
say, two or three months were made permissible only 
on production .of a medical certificate showing that the 
child's health would not be injured by its mother's em- 
ployment away from home. And thirdly, some new 
clause should be added by which a mother's services 
could not be obtained by any employer whatever within 
a month of her giving birth to a child. These may 
appear to be small points, but they are of great im- 
portance. At present Section 61 is being considerably 
evaded, which indicates negligence, at least, on the part of 
employers, and in some degree ignorance on the part of 
mothers, although there is no doubt that it is often a 
question of working or starving. " The spirit, if not the 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 271 

letter," reported Miss Anderson, Principal Lady Inspector 
of Factories, " of the present law is broken." The enforce- 
ment of factory sanitation will be mentioned subsequently. 

Thirdly, if married women's labour be not prohibited, 
there is much urgent need, especially in some towns, for a 
greater protection of children in the absence of the mother. 
In the towns where married women are employed it will 
be found that the infant mortality is largely caused by the 
absence of the mother from home. It must be admitted 
that this is chiefly owing to absence of natural feeding, but 
it is also largely due to neglect, careless artificial feeding, 
exposure to cold, and all that follows in the wake of an 
absent mother. For such children some form of creche is 
probably necessary where they may be tended and cared 
for daily. 

Such creches, or Day Nurseries, exist in most civilised 
countries. In France and Germany they are more strictly 
controlled and applied to the interest of the child than in 
this country, where there is room for considerable reform. 
The following facts are of interest in this connection. 1 

I. England. 

In England, almost without exception, Day Nurseries 
(of which there are about 75) are charitable undertakings, 
depending for their support upon private subscriptions. 
The average accommodation per nursery is for between 
20 and 30 infants, and ranges from 10 to 65, and the 
average attendance varies from 50 to 90 per cent, of the 
capacity of the nurseries. The ages at which the infants 

1 For the information as to creches in England, France, and Germany, I 
am indebted to a comprehensive report on the subject by the Chief 
Officer of the Public Control Department of the London County Council, 
No. 884 (1904), and to a special report by Dr. S. G. H. Moore, Medical 
Officer of Health of Huddersfield, 1905. The latter has viewed the matter 
particularly from the point of view of infant mortality, and much of what 
follows on the subject of crtches is derived from his report. 



272 INFANT MORTALITY 

are eligible for admission are from three or four weeks 
up to five years. 

The staff of the nurseries, of course, depends upon the 
number of children received, and their age ; but generally 
it is found that one nurse with a young girl as assistant 
can take charge of about 20 infants, and it is found that a 
nursery capable of receiving 50 infants will require a staff 
of Matron, Nurse, and two girls. 

The nurseries are generally opened between 7 and 
8 a.m. (although in exceptional cases the time of opening 
is as early as 5.30 a.m.), and the children are fetched away 
between the hours of 6.30 and 8 o'clock at night, the 
average stay being about 12 hours. The charges vary 
from 2d. to 4d. per day, and in most nurseries only half 
the usual charge is made for the children of widows and 
widowers, and a reduction is also made if more than one 
child from the same house attends the nursery. The fees 
are usually paid day by day. The School Board creches 
in London (4) are free, as are also several others. Food 
is provided for the children according to their ages. At 
most of the nurseries clothing is not provided, with the 
exception of short pinafores, which are worn by the 
children over their ordinary clothes. In one or two in- 
stances the children are clothed during the time they are 
in the nursery with garments belonging to the Institution, 
their own clothes being kept in washable bags outside 
the nursery, separate bags being provided for each child. 
Provision is made for sleeping by means of cradles for 
the younger, and cots, large couches, and " pounds " for 
others. In some of the institutions each child has its own 
particular cradle or cot. The children are expected to 
be brought in a cleanly state as regards the person and 
clothing, and in some cases admission is refused unless 
this is done. In seven of the London creches each child is 
bathed daily. 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 273 

To prevent the introduction and spread of infectious 
disease in the nurseries, an examination is usually made 
of infants brought for admission, and in several of the 
nurseries the child is required to be examined by a 
medical man, and a certificate given as to freedom from 
any infectious disease. Any suspicious case of illness is 
at once isolated until after medical examination, or sent 
home. 

With reference to children who are suffering from 
diseases which are not of an infectious nature, the general 
rule appears to be to admit such as do not require any 
special attention, although in one or two of the nurseries 
children who are at all unwell are not admitted. 

The cost of maintenance of the nurseries in England 
varies from 2s. to 43. per child per week, the average cost 
being about 33. 3d. Many of the nurseries have the build- 
ing provided free of charge and receive a good many gifts, 
which renders it impossible to state accurately the actual 
cost. The salaries paid appear to be approximately : 
Matron, 8s. to 12s. ; nurses, 45. to 8s.; and girls, from 33. 
to 53. per week. 

In most of the nurseries only children whose parents 
are obliged to work during the day are received, such as 
children of widows and widowers, and children from 
houses where both parents work during the day. In some 
of the nurseries only fatherless children are received, 
and in some infants must be vaccinated, whilst in others 
the marriage certificate must be produced. In 27 of 
the 55 London creches illegitimate children are not 
admitted. 

From the manner in which the nurseries are used it 
would appear that they fulfil a want, and it is beyond 
doubt that at least while the infants are at the nurseries 
they are well fed, cared for, and kept in a cleanly con- 
dition. 



274 INFANT MORTALITY 

II. France. 

In four towns which replied to the inquiries made by 
Dr. Moore, namely, Paris, Lille, Dieppe, and Nantes, 
there are Day Nurseries. In the sixty-six creches in Paris 
the support is by means of contributions from the State 
and City, and subscriptions from private persons. All are 
under the supervision of the Administrative Authority. 1 

In the Department du Nord, in which Lille is situate, 
there are forty-eight nurseries thirty-eight at Lille, three 
at Roubaix, two at Dunkirk and Tourcoing, and one each 
at Rosendael, Canbrai, and Joix-du-Nord, some of which 
are supported by the Municipality, some privately, and 
some by the Municipality and private means combined, 
and all are under the control of the Administrative 
Authority. 

In Dieppe the nursery is a private one, subsidised by the 
town. 

In Nantes there are two nurseries supported solely by 
private means, and four charitable institutions subsidised 
by the town. 

Without exception they are successful, and have been ot 
much service to the poor people, but, as is expected, they 
are not self-supporting. They are controlled by Regula- 
tions prescribed by the Decree Concerning Nurseries, issued 
by the President of the Republic, May 2, 1897, and based 
upon similar regulations decreed in 1862. The Minister 
of the Interior and the Prefect are empowered to lay down 
minor conditions and regulations under an Order. The 
Ministerial Order of December 20, 1897, * s a document of 

1 These nurseries receive children from their birth up to the age of 
three years. Each establishment contains at least twenty-five to thirty 
beds, and is under medical supervision. The resources come to them 
from (i) Subscriptions from the members of a Society ; (2) gifts ; 
(3) legacies ; (4) contributions from the State, from the Department, from 
the City of Paris, and from the Society of Day Nurseries. The subscrip- 
tions of the City of Paris in 1903 amounted to 144,000 francs (6,000) ; 
(5) Payments by mothers, who contributed about id. or 2d. per day. 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 275 

much interest, entering fully into many important details. 
For example, that infants shall not be kept in the nurseries 
at night, that weaned infants shall be separated from 
unweaned ; the necessary cubic capacity of rooms in the 
nursery ; the heating arrangements ; the suitability of 
cradles, beds, and articles of toilette ; the absolute dis- 
allowance of the tube feeding-bottle ; accommodation for 
feeding and the kind and quantity of food ; the manage- 
ment of sickness and protection from infection ; and the 
keeping of a register. Elementary counsels to mothers and 
nurses are also issued. 1 In Dr. Moore's report there is an 
interesting account of the results of works of this kind in 
the Commune of Villiers le Due. 

III. Germany. 

Dr. Moore states that in Elberfeld and Munich there 
are Day Nurseries (Krippen) supported by the town. In 
Schwerin, Darmstadt, Dusseldorf, Bremen, Leipsic, Breslau, 
Elberfeld, Munich, Berlin, Kiel, Cologne, and Hamburg 
there are Day Nurseries which are supported by charity 
but some of which also receive a grant from the town and 
State. In Frankfort the municipal authorities arrange for 
the children of poor parents who are obliged to work 
during the day to be taken care of by the neighbours, but 
there is a movement on foot, in which the municipality, 
however, are not concerned, to establish a Day Nursery. 

The object of the nurseries is to look after the children 
of poor people who have to work outside the house during 
the day. The children remain in the nursery up to the 
age of about three years. There are also Waiting Schools 
and Children's Nursing Institutes in many of the towns 
for older children. 

Without exception the nurseries have proved a great 
success, and it cannot be doubted that they have fulfilled 
1 See Appendix, p. 346. 



276 INFANT MORTALITY 

their objects. They offer to the children a healthy adoption, 
food of a nutritious character, and the moral and physical 
development of the children is looked after. They do not 
appear to be a financial success, nor is such expected or 
aimed at, and they all require a considerable sum over and 
above that received by way of fees from the children to 
enable them to continue. 

In Dusseldorf, in order to reduce infantile mortality, 
strong regulations have been made respecting the milk 
supply and other cognate matters. 1 Special regulations 
also exist for looking after foster children, places where 
they are kept being liable to surprise visits by medical 
men, and, if neglect is found, the permission which is 
necessary for the adoption of foster children is withdrawn. 

In Elberfeld the keeping of children by foster mothers 
is subject to police regulations. A print of regulations 
and recommendations, practically similar to the Dusseldorf 
regulations, is given in every case of birth, and arrange- 
ments are also made with the doctors by which the town 
undertakes the cost of first treatment in pressing cases. 
There are also arrangements in existence by which poor, 
suffering children are afforded holidays in the country for 
the good of their health. In Elberfeld there are also 
other kindred institutions a Kinderheim conducted by a 
deaconess, and a Marienheim supported by the sisters 
of the Catholic communion. Dr. Moore is able to quote 
various regulations concerning the fitting-up and adminis- 
tration of Krippen in Elberfeld. 

In Cologne there are also soup-kitchens for poor children, 
holiday colonies for sending poor, delicate children into the 
country for a short period, and milk stations. A copy of 
the recommendations for the nourishment and nursing 
of poor children in their first year is given in every case 
of birth. 

1 See Dr. Moore's Report, 1905, pp. 85-92. 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 277 

The advantages claimed for the creche system may be 
summarised as follows : (i) The creche is usually healthier 
and cleaner than the child's home ; the treatment is more 
enlightened, and the method of feeding better adapted to 
the child's tender age. (2) At the creche the child is 
taught cleanliness and good habits, becomes stronger and 
healthier, and is given a better chance in life. (3) Creches 
are under medical supervision, and the promptitude with 
which a case of sickness is treated often prevents more 
serious consequences. (4) The mother is required to bring 
the child clean ; better methods of feeding are learned ; 
and the cleanliness and discipline of the creche insensibly 
react to the advantage of the home. 

Yet after all they are but a palliative method of pre- 
vention, and are not to be' compared for a moment in 
value with education and training of the mother. The 
diminution in the proportion of women occupied in 
domestic service (from 14*2 to I2'2 per cent, at the last 
census), compulsory education, and the increase in the 
cultivation of amusement, and the love of ease and 
pleasure, have tended to lessen domesticity among the 
younger working women of the present day, and it is 
these conditions which would appear to necessitate the 
largest degree of constructive reform. No scheme of 
assisting maternity can ever have a wholesome effect 
which lessens the sense of responsibility or minimises the 
essential value of personal service.

PREVENTIVE METHODS: (II.) THE CHILD 

r I ^HE methods which concern more particularly the 
J. child are those of birth-registration, protection, and 
artificial feeding. 

(i) The first attempt to require by law the registration 
of births was in 1812, when an Act was passed for 
regulating and preserving parish and other registers of 
births, baptisms, marriages, and burials in England. The 
only registrations required by this Act were those of 
baptisms. In 1836, however, an Act came into force for 
registering births, deaths, and marriages, and for the 
establishment of the necessary administrative machinery 
and the appointment of a Registrar-General. To the 
Guardians of the Union in each district was allocated 
the duty of arranging the registration districts and the 
appointment of registrars, &c. As the Act of 1836 did 
not specify any time limit for the registration of births, it 
became necessary eventually to pass an amendment Act, 
namely, the Births and Deaths Registration Act of 1874, 
by Section I of which it was enacted that in the case of 
every child born alive it shall be the duty of the parents, or 
in their default the occupier of the house in which the child 
was born, to give to the district registrar, within forty-two 
days of the birth, information and the necessary particulars 
for registration. Where this information has not been 

278 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 279 

furnished within the specified period the registrar may, by 
notice in writing, require the necessary information within 
not less that seven days and not more than three months 
It is the duty of the registrar to inform himself as far 
as possible of every birth occurring within his district. 
Where a birth has not been registered within twelve 
months of its occurrence it cannot be registered except 
by consent of the Registrar- General, and the Super- 
intendent Registrars are empowered by the Act to 
institute proceedings for failure to register. In the case 
of an illegitimate child no penalty attaches to the father 
for non-registration, but the mother is liable for neglect 
to register. The father may, however, have the child 
registered in his name if he so elects. No registration is 
required of still-born children, but before such can be 
buried a medical certificate, coroner's certificate, or parental 
declaration is required. 

In practice it has been found that about two-thirds of 
the total births occurring in England and Wales are 
registered within the six weeks' limit of the Act of 1874, 
whilst as we have seen about one-third of the total deaths 
of infants takes place in the first month. It is therefore 
evident that many births first come to the knowledge of 
the Sanitary Authority on the bills of mortality, which 
effectually precludes any preventive action. 

In 1854 an Act was passed "to provide for the better 
registration of births, deaths, and marriages in Scotland," 
under which birth registration is required within twenty-one 
days, just half the allowed period in vogue in England. 1 
This, of course, is a considerable improvement, but even 
so it is found that three weeks is an inconveniently long 
period for the Sanitary Authority to wait for information 
as to births. Accordingly, efforts have been made to 

1 The French Code (Civil Art. 55) provides for registration within three 
days of birth. 



280 INFANT MORTALITY 

organise a system of earlier intimation. In Glasgow a 
remuneration of one shilling has been offered to any one 
intimating to the Medical Officer of Health the occurrence 
of a birth within forty-eight hours of the event. Dr. 
Chalmers reports, however, that this arrangement has not 
produced the desired effect, a failure which has been 
counteracted in part by a system of intimation (within 
forty-eight hours) from the Maternity Hospital of " out- 
door " births attended by the staff. In various districts 
lady sanitary inspectors have periodical access to the 
registrar's lists, or midwives are furnishing early informa- 
tion. This last method has been most fully organised in 
London, where the Medical Officer of the County Council 
(Sir Shirley F. Murphy) has arranged to collect every 
week from the midwives a record of births attended 
by them and to distribute these lists to the various 
Borough Councils. In this way early intimation is 
obtained of a large number of births. 

Lastly, in Huddersfield a voluntary system of payment 
of one shilling, as in Glasgow, for birth intimations within 
forty-eight hours, which has been adopted for some 
months, has developed into a clause in a local Act 
making this notification compulsory. 1 The House of 
Commons has approved of the clause, which, it may be 
hoped, is thus destined to be the forerunner of new 
legislation requiring the early notification of births, 
without which the Sanitary Authority is considerably 

1 The operative part of the clause reads as follows : 

" i. In the case of every child born within the borough after the com- 
mencement of this Act, it shall be the duty of the father of the child, if he 
is actually residing in the house where the birth takes place at the time of 
its occurrence, or in his absence of any person in attendance upon the 
mother at the time of the birth or within six hours thereafter, to send or 
give notice of the birth to the Medical Officer within forty-eight hours 
after such birth." 

The fee payable for notification is one shilling. Penalty for failure to 
notify, twenty shillings. 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 281 

hampered in the exercise of preventive measures against 
early infant death. 1 

(2) The law provides for the protection of children and 
infants in three enactments the Mid wives Act of 1902, the 
Infant Life Protection Act, 1897, and the Prevention of 
Cruelty to Children Act, 1904. A steady and uniform 
enforcement of these three statutes, with some minor 
amendments, is likely to result in immense improvement. 
We have not yet had time to experience to the full the 
enormous difference to the child-life of Great Britain which 
may yet result from this legislation. A few words as to 
the purpose of each Act may be added. 

() The Midwives Act. 

In addition to the performance of various routine work 
in connection with the registration of midwives, the follow- 
ing duties having direct import with regard to the public 
health are to be carried out by the Local Supervising 
Authority under Section 8 of the Act : 

1 . The Authority is to exercise a general supervision over all 
midwives practising within its area, in accordance with rules 
drawn up by the Central Midwives Board in pursuance of 
Section 3 of the Act. 

2. The Authority is to investigate charges of malpractice, 
negligence, or misconduct on the part of any midwife practising 
in its area, and, should a primd, facie case be established, to 
report the same to the Central Midwives Board. 

3. The Authority is to suspend a midwife from practice, 

1 The Registrar-General, in reviewing this question, writes in the Report 
just issued : " After serious consideration of the situation as it presents 
itself to me, I have come to the conclusion that whilst it would be unwise 
at present to disturb the existing organisation of birth registration, a well- 
devised system of early notification of births legalised and worked in 
conjunction with the present registration system on the one hand, and 
with sanitary administration on the other might, along with other motive 
forces, serve as a most effective and lasting barrier with which to stem 
the tide of infant mortality." (Sixty-seventh Ann. Rep. of Registrar-General, 
1904, p. xlix.) 



282 INFANT MORTALITY 

when necessary to do so, in accordance with the rules drawn up 
by the Central Midwives Board in pursuance of Section 3 of 
the Act. 

The more important of the rules which have been 
drawn up by the Central Midwives Board, as cited above, 
are to the following effect : 

I. Whenever a midwife has been in attendance upon a patient 
suffering from puerperal fever, or from any other illness supposed 
to be infectious, she must disinfect herself, and all her instruments 
and other appliances, to the satisfaction of the Local Sanitary 
Authority, and must have her clothing thoroughly disinfected 
before going to another labour. 

II. Formal notification must be made by the midwife to the 
Local Supervising Authority when any of the following occur : 

(a) When the mother or the child dies without having 
been seen by a Registered Medical Practitioner. 

(b} When the child is deemed to be stillborn. 

(c) When, owing to the occurrence of various complica- 
tions of either the labour or of its aftercourse, as defined in 
the rules, it has been necessary for the midwife to " advise 
that a Registered Medical Practitioner be sent for." 

III. The Local Supervising Authority must make arrange- 
ments to secure a proper inspection of every midwife's case-book, 
bag of instruments and appliances, &c., and must, when thought 
necessary, make arrangements for an inspection of the midwife's 
place of residence, and for an investigation of her mode of 
practice. 

IV. In carrying out certain rules for checking the spreading of 
puerperal infection by midwives, it will be the duty of the Local 
Supervising Authority to suspend from practice a midwife who 
contravenes the directions issued for the use of disinfectants and 
for the proper safeguards against the spread of infection laid down 
by the Central Midwives Board, and any other rules laid down by 
the Board. And in the exercise of that duty the Local Super- 
vising Authority shall, after communicating their decision in writing 
to the midwife concerned, at once report any suspension (with the 
grounds thereof) to the Central Midwives Board. 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 283 

The avowed object of this Act was to secure the better 
training of midwives and to regulate their practice ; and 
when it is remembered that there is a heavy loss of infant 
life within a few days after birth, it will be seen how great 
may be the saving of life through its means. Indeed, the 
midwife is often the first teacher of the mother as to 
infant management, and in various districts she is now, in 
practice, acting in this capacity and as an early certifier of 
births. 

(b} The Infant Life Protection Act, 1897. 

The first legislative enactment to protect nurse- 
children was the Infant Life Protection Act of 1872, 
which provided that a person could not receive for hire or 
reward more than one infant, or, in the case of twins, two 
infants, under the age of one year, for maintenance apart 
from their parents, for a longer period than twenty-four 
hours, except in a house which had been registered as a 
suitable place. And in 1896 Lord Denbigh, on behalf of 
the London County Council, introduced a Bill in the 
House of Lords, which eventually passed unopposed 
through both Houses, and became the Infant Life Pro- 
tection Act of 1897. The chief provisions of this Act will 
be found in the Appendix (p. 350). 

It is desirable that the Act should be extended to 
include every child received for hire or reward, and every 
child adopted for a lump sum, no matter what the amount ; 
that nurse-children should remain under inspection until 
seven years of age ; and the Local Authority should be 
empowered to remove an infant from the keeping of any 
person who is unfit to take care of it, by reason of 
character or otherwise, and to remove any child kept in a 
house or on premises unsuitable for the purpose. "Single" 
cases need inspection equally with those where more 
children than one are nursed, because infant deaths are

largely caused by preventable diseases resulting from 
carelessness, ignorance and neglect, and nothing but 
regular inspection can remedy this. 1 

(c) The Prevention of Cruelty to Children Act, 1904. 

This Act only concerns infancy in a general way as a 
statute for the prevention of cruelty to all or any chil- 
dren. Section i enacts that if any person over the age 
of sixteen years, who has the care of any child under 
the age of sixteen years, wilfully assaults, ill-treats, 
neglects, abandons, or exposes such child, or causes or 
procures such child to be assaulted, ill-treated, neglected, 
abandoned, or exposed in a manner likely to cause such 
child unnecessary suffering, or injury to its health (includ- 
ing injury to or loss of sight, or hearing, or limb, or organ 
of the body, and any mental derangement), that person 
shall be guilty of a misdemeanour ; and (a) on conviction 
on indictment; shall be liable, at the discretion of the 
court, to a fine not exceeding ;ioo, or alternatively, or in 
default of payment of such fine, or in addition thereto, to 
imprisonment, with or without hard labour, for any term 
not exceeding two years ; and (b} on summary conviction, 
shall be liable, at the discretion of the court, to a fine not 
exceeding 2$, or alternatively, or in default of payment 
of such fine, or in addition thereto, to imprisonment, with 
or without hard labour, for any term not exceeding six 
months. 

A person may be convicted of an offence under this 
section either on indictment or by a court of summary 

1 Much has been written on a relation which, it is believed by some, 
obtains between infant mortality and insurance. No doubt most dead 
infants have been insured, for the reason that most infants of the poor are 
habitually insured. There is but little evidence in support of the view 
that many infants are insured and then slowly but wilfully done to death. 
No doubt such events occur, but they do not contribute substantially to 
the death rate.

jurisdiction notwithstanding the death of the child in 
respect of whom the offence is committed. 

If it is proved that a person indicted under this 
section was directly or indirectly interested in any sum 
of money accruable or payable in the event of the 
death of the child, the court, in its discretion, may (a) in- 
crease the amount of the fine, or () sentence the person 
indicted to penal servitude for any term not exceeding 
five years. 

THE ARTIFICIAL FEEDING OF INFANTS. 

(3) Next to absolute protection comes infant feeding, 
and the great requirement is the breast-feeding of infants* 
But this unfortunately is not always possible. A mother 
may be unable from one cause or another to furnish a 
natural supply of milk for her child. Some mothers may 
be unwilling to nurse their children, and others, though 
desiring to do so, may find it impracticable, owing to 
the fact that they may have to act as the bread-winner 
of a family and go out to work. But if all these cases 
be deducted from the total there yet remains in large 
communities a considerable number of mothers incapable 
of nursing their children. It is for such cases that Infants' 
Milk Depdts have been established, to supply &pure milk, 
suitably modified to make it as much like human milk as 
possible. It is clear that such a specialised milk-supply 



1 Abundant evidence has been furnished in previous chapters of the 
high mortality occurring among artificially-fed infants as compared with 
breast-fed. M. le Prof. Budin, of Paris, kindly allows me to reproduce his 
charts illustrating this special incidence in Paris. The matter could 
hardly be more clearly demonstrated, for the charts show not only the 
marked rise of diarrhoea mortality in the third quarter of the year, but the 
special mortality of the artificially fed as compared with the breast-fed. 
The decline in both, illustrated in the second chart (1899-1001), Dr. Budin 
believes to be due to the influence of the improved feeding of infants 
originating in the French milk depots and consultations. 



286 INFANT MORTALITY 

does not meet the entire problem of infant mortality, 
the solution of which depends, on the whole, ultimately, 
not upon the State, nor yet upon this or that system of 
milk feeding, but, as we have seen, upon the intelligence, 
the devotion, and the maternal instinct of the mother. 
Nevertheless, it is true that a properly equipped and con- 
trolled Infants' Milk Depdt is part of the solution at the 
present time and under present conditions, and is a 
practical step in the right direction. 

Infants' Milk Depots are of French origin, and are 
generally speaking of two kinds namely, the consulta- 
tion de nourrissons and fa& goutte de lait.* In 1892, Budin 
founded one of the former at the Charite" Hospital in Paris, 
and in the same year Variot established another one in 
connection with the Belleville Dispensary. There are two 
types of consultations de nourrissons the one is a kind of 
lying-in institution in which women are admitted for 
confinement free of charge, and the children born in the 
hospital are kept as out-patients under regular medical 
supervision for the first two years. Breast-feeding is 
encouraged, but where impracticable, sterilised milk 
is supplied in bottles containing sufficient for one meal 
only. The child is weighed and examined periodically. 
In the second type, the consultation is not attached to 
a hospital, but is otherwise similar. The goutte de lait 
(or drop of milk) is a sort of milk dispensary from which 
infants are fed, under medical supervision, upon sterilised 
milk, with or without modification. The first institution 
of this kind to exist separately was established at Fecamp 
in 1894 by Dr. Leon Dufour. Most of these Infants' 
Milk Depots in France are conducted on a philanthropic 
basis, and are financed by voluntary subscriptions. At

some of them arrangements are made by which food is 
supplied to weakly mothers who suckle their infants ; at 
others mothers who breast-feed their children receive a 
douceur of 3 francs every fortnight when they bring their 
infant to be weighed. Again, some of the consultations 
serve as training schools for future mothers, being 
attended by jeunes filles who take a voluntary share in 
the management. Thus it will be seen that there is a 
variety of useful purposes which may be fulfilled by these 
institutions. There are now upwards of ninety gouttes de 
lait in France, and in other countries they are also being 
established. 

In 1893 a somewhat similar movement was started 
by the Hon. Nathan Straus, who established a milk 
depot in New York for the sale of milk for children under 
five years of age. The milk is cooled after yield and 
refrigerated during transport to the fourteen or more 
depots now existing. At the laboratory it is run 
through a separator for purification from particulate 
matter and bottled. It is then pasteurised for twenty 
minutes at 167 F. About 250,000 bottles of this 
milk are now issued monthly. Mr. Straus claims that 
this milk has been "the most important element" 
in the reduction of the number of deaths of children 
under five years of age in New York since 1893. 
From 1891-95 the average mortality among children 
of this age was, according to Mr. Straus, 90*6 per 1,000, 
and in the quinquennium 1900-4 it had fallen to 6r2 
per 1,000. The deaths of children from June to August 
have also greatly fallen in number, and a similar reduction 
has taken place in the Infant Asylum at Randall's Island, 
New York, where the milk has been supplied. 1 The 
methods of Mr. Straus have been adopted elsewhere 
also with good results. 

1 See Brit. Med. your., 1905, vol. ii. pp. 644-646. 



288 INFANT MORTALITY 

The first Infants' Milk Depot in England was opened 
in 1899 at St. Helens, in Lancashire, and since that 
date depots have been established at Liverpool, 1901 
(the largest in this country), 1 Battersea, 1902, and in 
about a dozen other places. They have not all followed 
the French type, particularly in respect of the medical 
supervision of the children and the discriminating 
distribution of the milk. Indeed, there is a somewhat 
unsatisfactory variety of method and purpose adopted, 
which has no doubt somewhat hindered a steady advance 
such as has occurred in France. Further, in this country 
the chief depots are carried on by the municipalities, and 
are larger and therefore more expensive as to plant than 
the ordinary French model. On the whole, however, 
satisfaction is generally expressed with the results up to 

1 Since its establishment early in 1901 to end of 1905, upwards of 10,000 
infants have been fed through the Liverpool Depots. 

The Medical Officer of Health of Liverpool (Dr. Hope) asks : " Can the 
municipality provide these means ? Ought it to do any more than attend 
carefully to general sanitation, to ensure that the milk shall be delivered 
pure and wholesome ; to send intelligent educated women to explain how 
the infant should be fed, and to teach the rudiments of domestic cleanli- 
ness ? Obviously, if it chooses to incur the expense, it can do a vast deal 
more, for it can provide actually the most suitable food for the infants 
whose mothers cannot suckle them, and provide it in such a form as to 
abolish, or at all events minimise, all the risks of bacterial contamination 
which is the most dangerous form of contamination during transit or 
domestic storage. 

" Without going into detail with regard to the nature of the food, it may 
be said that the aim is to prepare from cows' milk a mixture which shall 
imitate chemically and physically, as closely as possible, the milk of the 
mother at various periods of lactation, and in such a form as to enable it 
to be given to the infant as free from bacterial impurity as the mother's 
milk. . . . The fact is that this step, no less than the others which have 
been enumerated, is merely a sanitary measure ; it is merely an attempt 
to break one more link in the chain of destruction ; it is not a trade any 
more than the supervision over the milk supply already referred to is a 
trade ; it will make no more return in cash than the employment of 
female inspectors will, or the provision of hospitals, or of parks and 
gardens, of baths and playgrounds, of street scavenging, or of sewage- 
farms ; like all of these, it is merely a sanitary measure, and the outlay in 
this case, like the outlay in the rest, is justified not by the cash profits, but 
by the improvement in the health of that section of the public, viz., the 
infant section, which it is designed to benefit." (Report on Health of 
Livtrpool, 1904, pp. 155-6-)

the present. 1 In addition to the ordinary infant milk 
depot, other allied work having similar objects has been 
done in connection with hospitals, and also independently, 
as at the Infants' Hospital at Hampstead. 

The Work of an Infant Milk Depdt. 

I propose to take as a type of these Infant Milk Dep6ts 
that established in Finsbury, which possesses characteristics 
of an important nature. The commencement of a Social 
Workers' Association furnished the occasion for the com- 
mencement of the Finsbury Infant Milk Depot, and the 
work entailed was undertaken by a voluntary committee 
of medical men, assisted by some lady visitors, the object 
being to establish a depdt on 'a small scale, under proper 
control and on satisfactory lines, for a few children, rather 
than to work a larger institution for a considerable number. 
The whole of the necessary funds were subscribed by a 
few friends of the enterprise. The principles by which the 
Medical Committee wished to be guided were : (a) Abso- 
lute control of the milk, and the avoidance of the serious 
fallacy of sterilising unclean milk ; (b) medical supervision 
of the entire management of the depot, and of the infants 
using the milk ; (c) a discriminating and careful distribu- 
tion of the milk only to infants who could not be breast- 
fed ; and (d) the systematic study of the effect of the milk 
on the children. 2 The committee desired to make the 
method as individual as possible, and in no way to lessen 
the responsibility of the mother. It is evident that these 
are not easy principles to carry out, and many difficulties 
were encountered. 

1 See Special Report on " Infantile Milk Depots," 1905 (November), by 
Dr. Sidney Davies, of Woolwich. 

The writer may perhaps be allowed to admit that his early belief in 
the efficacy of Infants' Milk Depots did not receive much encouragement 
from the simple fact that these four principles, among others, did not 
appear to be practised in the depots of which he had knowledge, 
u 



290 INFANT MORTALITY 

On the whole, however, the results have been satis- 
factory, owing to the fact that there is medical supervision, 
and that the milk is prepared, and, if necessary, sterilised 
on the farm. 

Preparation of the Milk. The first essential in the 
establishment of an Infants' Milk Dep6t is a pure milk. It 
is idle to attempt to work on the basis of obtaining ordinary 
unclean milk and trusting to sterilisation for the removal 
of any unsatisfactory characters. It cannot be too clearly 
understood that sterilisation does not make bad milk good, 
or dirty milk clean. Nor is it sufficient merely to contract 
for a supply to the depot from some dairyman of good 
standing. As far as possible, complete control from the 
very beginning is necessary to ensure purity. The depot 
and the milk farm must in some way be directly connected 
with and under the control of those responsible for the 
working of the depdt. Great harm has been done to the 
whole cause of milk reform by duality of responsibility and 
by attempting to meet all difficulties by sterilisation. 
Milk is a favourable nidus for microbes. A pint of 
apparently good milk may contain millions. Most of 
them are fortunately harmless ; but some are not, and all 
of them begin to produce in an hour or two toxicity or 
staleness in the milk. Sterilised milk may be free from 
living germs, but it is not on that account necessarily free 
from the toxicity produced in it before the organisms were 
killed by heat. If it was, in short, a dirty milk before 
sterilisation, it is also a dirty milk afterwards, although the 
actual microbes may have been killed. It is, then, neces- 
sary that milk should be absolutely pure before any 
modification is undertaken. 

A second requirement is that any treatment of the milk 
refrigeration, sterilisation, or modification should be 
carried out immediately after milking and, if possible, at 
the farm. The treatment of a stale milk, or of a milk 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 291 

which has spent many hours on the railway, is not at all 
the same thing as its treatment when fresh and just drawn 
from the udder. 

By the kind offices and co-operation of Mr. J. Carson, 
of Theydon Bois, the milk used at the Finsbury Depot is 
obtained from his farm in Essex, and is modified according 
to the committee's prescription at the farm immediately 
after milking. Mr. Carson's farm consists of 82 acres near 
Epping, and is managed on scientific and business principles. 

The dairy herd consists of about 70 thoroughbred 
Jersey cows, and is specially selected for milking purposes. 
As is well known, this breed of dairy cow yields a high 
quality milk, richer in cream than the milk of the ordinary 
shorthorn or their cross. It is also rich in colour and 
liberal in quantity. The average yield per cow at Crystal- 
brook Farm is about 600 to 700 gallons per annum, as 
compared with a general average of about 420 gallons per 
annum. 1 Each cow in the herd is tested once a year with 
the tuberculin test, and any cow reacting to the test is at 
once eliminated from the herd. During the last six years, 
of all the milch cows tested at this farm only four have 
reacted, which gives a percentage of O'6. 2 A number of 
animals leave, and others join, the herd every year, which 
is thus continually reinforced and refreshed. The quality 
and quantity of each cow's milk is tested monthly and 
recorded. The feeding of the cows is kept under strict 
control. No brewer's grains are used. In summer the 
cows feed on fresh grass, the grazing land being limed 
every other year ; they also have linseed oil cake, and a 
small quantity of cotton-seed cake and bran. In winter 
they have hay, mangolds, crushed oats, maize, germ meal, 

1 " Blue Violet," one of the Crystalbrook herd, yielded 1,100 gallons of 
milk in 19x14. 

a In 1902 Geddes showed that Jersey cattle on the Island of Jersey gave 
a percentage of O'3i, whereas those tested on the mainland gave a much 
higher percentage of reaction. 



292 INFANT MORTALITY 

and linseed and cotton-seed cake. The cows are groomed 
daily. In the summer they are out day and night, and 
even in winter spend the day in the open air. They are 
milked twice daily (6 a.m. and 5 p.m.) in the byre ad- 
joining the milk laboratory. No cow is milked for the 
depot within a week of calving. The udders of the cows 
are cleaned before milking, and the milkers themselves are 
required to be clean in person and manner of milking. 
Clean white overalls are used, and all utensils, cans, and 
churns are kept scrupulously clean and regularly sterilised 
by steam. 

The farm itself is well kept, and has an abundant water 
supply from the Herts and Essex Water Works Company, 
Ltd. 1 There are four cowsheds (for 28, 24, 12, and 4 
cows respectively), built of brick and having tiled roofs. 
There is an abundant window space and means of ventila- 
tion. The floors are concreted and channelled. The 
manure is removed from the sheds at once, stacked 200 
yards away, and, as soon as practicable, placed on the 
fields. The liquid refuse runs into a cemented tank, and 
from this is forced by windmill pump on to the arable land. 
The buildings and arrangements are very simple but the 
conditions obtaining reach a high standard of excellence. 

These details have been mentioned as they have every- 
thing to do with the efficiency of the whole dairy farm. 
Poor cows giving a small yield of milk and kept amidst much 
insanitation and filth and these are conditions prevailing 
all over England not only result in poor, unclean milk, but 
are a poor investment. A large and rich yield of milk per 
cow is necessary in order to make a dairy farm pay. And 
the other matters named are each and all important in 
their way as leading to efficiency and a pure supply of 

1 The Medical Committee had a bacteriological examination made of 
the water as supplied at the farm, and found it of an exceptionally high 
standard of purity. 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 293 

milk. Generally speaking, however, Mr. Carson does 
nothing on his farm that could not be done on almost 
every dairy farm in the kingdom with care, attention to 
detail, and the training of the staff. His cowsheds are of 
the simplest construction, and there is no elaboration or 
unnecessary expense. Economy with cleanliness and 
efficiency in all these matters should be the guiding 
principle. 

Immediately after milking the milk is removed and 
strained through a metal screen. It is then cooled over 
a Lawrence refrigerator in the open air under cover, and at 
once taken into the adjoining laboratory and separated in 
an ordinary Laval separator, which acts, of course, in part 
as a method of purifying the -milk. The separated milk 
is then modified as described below, and poured by means 
of a mechanical automatic bottle-filler into bottles which 
have been previously sterilised at 212 F. for 60 minutes. 
In winter the bottled milk is then pasteurised at 140 or 
1 50 F. for 20 minutes, and in summer it is sterilised at 
212 F. for 20 minutes. In mid- winter for a period of some 
weeks no pasteurisation or heating of any kind is done. 
After pasteurisation the milk is cooled to 53 F. by 
admitting- cold water into the steriliser, and kept at that 
tempera' ; re until the time has arrived for transmission by 
rail in cases (holding 100 bottles each) to the Distributing 
Depot in Finsbury. The milk for the Infants' Depot is 
milked in the evening, modified and bottled within a few 
minutes of leaving the udder, kept on ice or in cold water, 
and delivered in Finsbury the next day, where in the 
summer it is kept on ice till distribution. 

Modification of the Milk. The Medical Committee, with 
the assistance of Mr. J. Kear Col well, F.I.C., Public 
Analyst, carefully considered the subject of standards of 
modification, and finally decided to commence with the 
three following degrees : 



294

A. One part separated milk, two parts water + 8 oz. 
cream + 7 oz. milk sugar to the gallon. 

B. One part separated milk, one part water + n oz. 
cream + 5 oz. milk sugar to the gallon. 

C. Two parts separated milk, one part water + 12 oz. 
cream + 5 oz. milk sugar to the gallon. 

Various degrees of modification were made with the 
average milk supplied by Mr. Carson's herd, and the above 
were found on analysis to yield desirable milks, and 
approximately comparable to human milk :

Variations in quantity are made from time to time, and 
the modification is not applied in any hard-and-fast 
manner, the particular milk for each child, whatever its 
age, being carefully considered after the first medical 
examination. Generally, however, it may be said that 
children receiving A modification consume from 6-10 oz. 
of pure milk daily, those receiving B between 1 5 and 20 oz., 
and those receiving C from 20-30 oz. of pure milk daily. 

Chemical and bacteriological examinations of the milk 
were made at intervals in order to check the process. The 
examinations made in London without any notice to the 
farm workers have shown a steady quality of milk approxi- 
mating as nearly to the standard set out above as the 
natural variations in cows' milk will permit. From a 
bacteriological point of view, the milk has been found to 
be sterile, or, when pasteurised only, containing a few lactic 
acid organisms per cubic centimetre. 

The Method of Working the Depdt. It has been intended 
that the depot should be both a remedy and a school a 
remedy by supplying suitable nourishment to infants 
debarred from natural mother's milk, and where necessary 
a school of infant management. It is not a milk shop 
where any person can obtain milk, and care has been 
taken in no way to injure the ordinary milk trade carried 
on in the borough. It is a specialised milk supply for 
special circumstances which cannot be met by the trade. 

The daily stock of milk is sent up to Finsbury in sealed 
bottles packed in specially prepared cases. On arrival at 
the distributing centre it is placed in a cool room, and in 
summer in a refrigerator. The depot, or distributing 
centre, consists of two rooms. One room is a waiting and 
dressing room, the other is the weighing room. In the 
latter room there is a refrigerator and shelves and cup- 
board for storing milk if necessary. There is also the 
weighing balance (a Walker-Gordon cradle balance), and 



296 INFANT MORTALITY 

record and register books. All unnecessary expense has 
been avoided. It is not so much upon apparatus as upon 
methods that a distributing centre depends for success. 

Infants requiring the milk are introduced to the depot 
by medical practitioners, hospitals, nurses, sanitary 
inspectors, birth registrars, and others. The parents or 
guardians must pay the necessary price of the milk in 
advance, and must be residents of Finsbury. The price 
charged is the ordinary market price of milk in the district 
; namely, 4d. per quart. On the Wednesday following the 
date of application the infant is brought to the depot, 
medically examined by a member of the Medical Com- 
mittee, and weighed. Particulars respecting the child are 
entered in the Record Book (see opposite}, and a second 
page is devoted to fortnightly entries as to progress, 
increase or otherwise of weight, and general physical 
condition. It is obligatory that the child shall be brought 
once a fortnight to be weighed, and, if necessary, examined. 
The milk is only supplied on this condition. No medicine 
is given, and if medical advice is required the mother is 
instructed to consult a medical man or go to hospital. 
The depdt is not a "consultation de nourrissons" but a 
" goutte de lait" After medical examination the suitable 
degree of modification is ordered from the farm, and the 
milk delivered. 

Measured bottles of varying size are used with a patent 
removable stopper, which comes clear away from the bottle. 
When required for use the bottle is placed in a jug of hot 
water to bring the temperature of the milk up to blood 
heat. The stopper is then removed and a clean teat placed 
on the bottle from which the child can then be fed. Each 
day a thoroughly clean teat is issued in the place of 
the teat provided the day before, which is returned to the 
depdt, washed in warm boracic lotion, soaked all night in 
boracic lotion, and in the morning washed under the tap.

INFANTS' MILK DEp6x. 

1. All charges for a supply of Modified Milk are payable in 
advance : 

Per day. Per week. 

For infants under 6 months ... 3d. ... is. 6d. 

from 6 to 9 months sjd. ... is. gd. 6 oz. bottles. 

over 9 months ... 4d. ... 2s. 7 oz. bottles. 

The depot is opened from 12 to i p.m. on weekdays, and from 
12.30 to 1.30 p.m. on Sundays in the summer. 

2. The milk will be supplied in bottles in a basket. Each 
bottle contains sufficient milk for one meal, the amount varying 
with the age of the child. Infants under two months receive 
nine bottles per day ; older children receive fewer bottles, as they 
should be fed less frequently. 

3. If children are sent for the milk, they must be warned not 
to tamper with the stoppers of the bottles. On no account must 
a bottle be opened until the infant is ready to be fed. 

4. Teats can be bought for 2d. each. The teats must be kept 
scrupulously clean ; after use they should be thoroughly washed 
in soda and hot water, then rinsed in cold water, and afterwards 
placed in a jar of clean cold water, where they should be kept 
until required for the next feed. The teat must be returned each 
day with the empty bottles. 

5. Just before use each bottle should be placed unopened in a 
basin or jug of hot water for about five minutes, and warmed. 
The bottle should then be opened and the teat put on. The 
child must be fed at regular intervals, and fed from these bottles 
only. On no account should any other feeding bottle be used. 

6. When all the milk in one bottle is not used, the remainder 
must not be warmed up again, but a fresh bottle opened for the 
next meal. 

7. On no account should bread or other food be given with 
the milk. The milk will be found to be quite sufficient if given 
regularly. 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 299 

8. Immediately after use, the bottle should be well rinsed in 
cold water. 

9. Full value will be charged for all bottles, baskets, stoppers, 
&c., not returned to the depdt. 

10. The child must be brought once a fortnight to be weighed, 
on Wednesdays at 2.30 p.m. 

11. The presence of infectious disease (including whooping 
cough, measles and chicken-pox) in a house must be at once 
notified at the depot. 

12. Names of applicants for the milk will be received at the 
dep6t daily at 1 2 noon. 

N.B. The Milk must never be used in preference to mother's milk, 
which is the best of all foods for young infants. 

A. Babies from Birth up to .the age of Three Months. 

A baby should have its meals, from the first, as regularly as a 
sick person, whether it is breast-fed or bottle-fed. This is of 
great importance to the baby's health, and if carefully carried out 
does much to " free " the mother's time. 

A baby under a fortnight old may be fed every two hours by 
day, and not oftener than every four hours at night. The baby 
should be awakened for food in the daytime, but not at night. 

A baby a month old should not be fed oftener than every 
z\ hours by day. Gradually extend the time between each feed, 
and by the time the child is three months old it should be fed 
only every three hours by day, and every five hours during the 
night if awake. Give the baby its last feed about 10 o'clock at 
night. Change it, and make it comfortable, and it will probably 
sleep until four o'clock in the morning. 

Be sure the milk is not given too hot. Just before use, the 
bottle should be placed unopened in a basin or jug of hot water 
for about five minutes. 

Give the food very slowly and train the child not to suck 
quickly. 

General Advice. 

Never give the baby Tea, Coffee, or Cocoa. The longer a child 
is kept from their use the better. 



300 INFANT MORTALITY 

It is very important to wash out the baby's mouth night and 
morning. Take a piece of clean rag, fix it firmly round the 
finger, dip it into clean water, and thoroughly wash the roof and 
gums of the child's mouth. Then burn the rag. A fresh piece 
must be used each time. 

You are strongly advised not to use a " comforter? Their use 
is often the cause of " thrush? and other diseases, and when the 
baby is constantly sucking them the digestive system gets no rest, 
This often causes wind and indigestion, and makes the baby cross 
and irritable. 

A healthy baby should gain from four to six ounces in weight 
every week. On an average a baby should double its weight in 
the first five months. A knowledge of a baby's gain or loss in 
weight gives the readiest indication of its health. So be sure 
and bring your baby to 264, Goswell Road, once a fortnight to 
be weighed. 

B. Babies -from Three to Six Months Old. 

A baby, four months old, should be fed every three hours by 
day and once in the night if it wakes, but if it is healthy and well 
it will probably sleep until about six in the morning, when it 
should be given its first feed. The next feed should be given 
about 9.30, as the feeds should be given three hours after the 
last feed is finished. It will now be having about 31^ oz. or i^ 
pints of milk per day. 

C. Babies -from Six Months to One Year Old. 

A baby, six months old, should be fed every three hours by day 
and once during the night if awake. The time between the feeds 
should be gradually extended, so that by the time the child is 
twelve months old it should be fed every four hours by day and 
not at all during the night. 

[After the child is ten months old and has cut several teeth it 
may be given milk pudding at dinner-time in addition to its 
bottle, if medically advised. At eleven months old it may have 
rusks or a little toasted bread soaked in milk, and at twelve 
months old some breadcrumbs and gravy, but do not reduce the 
quantity of milk that it gets each day, and do not be in a hurry to 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 301 

leave off " bottles? A " weaned " baby often suffers from lack of 
nourishment.] 

Each child fed on the depot milk is visited in its own 
home once a week, and in some cases more frequently. 
In this way a direct personal influence is brought to bear 
on the mother, and homely advice is given and precautions 
taken as to the management of the infant. Sanitary con- 
ditions and their effect on the health of the child are 
noted. Moreover, it has been found in practice that 
printed instructions as to the way in which the milk is to 
be used are not properly understood by the mother apart 
from personal advice or actual demonstration. Preparation 
and bottling at the farm protect the milk from home con- 
tamination , but it is necessary that the infant should take 
the milk direct from the bottle in the proper way if such 
contamination is to be absolutely avoided. Good practice 
in this respect is obtained by personal visits. I attribute 
much of the success of the depot to these personal visits 
and assistance. They have been of the greatest value to 
both mothers and infants. This part of the work has been 
done by Miss Frith, who is a certificated hospital nurse (St. 
Bartholomew's Hospital) and certified under the Midwives 
Act, 1902. She instructs the mothers as to points needing 
their attention, and visits each home to see that the in- 
structions are being properly carried out. She keeps a 
visiting diary in which periodical notes respecting each 
child's progress are kept ; she also keeps a register and 
account-book of payments for the milk. 

It should be added that the children admitted to the 
depot are only such as belong to Finsbury, and are intro- 
duced by lady sanitary inspectors, medical men, and neigh- 
bouring hospitals. 

A Study of Results. The depot was opened on 
November 23, 1904, and up to April, 1906, 184 children 



302 



INFANT MORTALITY 



had been entered on the books. Twenty per cent, of the 
children came from homes of one room only, and another 
43 per cent, from two-roomed homes. So that not less 
than 63 per cent, lived in homes of two rooms or less, and 
very few indeed lived in homes of four rooms or more. It 
may be taken, therefore, that the children came as a rule 
from poor homes. 

A second point of importance is that 75 per cent, of the 
children admitted were ill at the time of admission, many 
of them were very seriously ill, and some of them dying. 
It is obvious that healthy children would not usually be 
introduced by medical men, who sent fully 55 per cent, 
of the total number. But many of the others were ill, 
underfed and wasting, and the mothers sought the depot 
on that account. Previous to admission 58 per cent, of the 
children had been fed on some form of cow's milk, and 
42 per cent, on condensed milk or artificial foods. In a 
number of cases the child had had a little breast milk 
during the first few days of life. 

The age and sex of the children admitted were as 
follows :

From this table it will be seen that 100 (or 54 per cent.) 
were admitted at or under three months of age, and this 
is a very important fact, for it directly affects the death 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 303 

rate, which is, as we have seen, much higher in the first 
few weeks of life. Fifteen of the parents applied but did 
not use the milk (unwilling to pay or conditions too 
strict, &c.). 

Before discussing some of the results of this milk-feeding 
in detail, it may be desirable to deal with two matters, 
namely, the general increase in weight, and the cause of 
death in the cases which ended fatally. 

First, as to increase in weight. The importance of the 
weight of an infant as a criterion of its health and progress 
is well known. Indeed, the weight is often the only 
criterion as to whether the infant is improving in health 
or not. At birth the average weight is about 7 Ibs. ; at 
three months it may be about' 9 to 1 1 Ibs. ; at six months 
about 13 to 15 Ibs. ; at nine months about 16 to 17 Ibs.; 
and at twelve months 19 to 20 Ibs. Dufour's standard has 
been used in the Finsbury Depdt, as in French depots, 
and the charts appearing in the present volume are drawn 
to that scale. It is well known that the standard rise in 
weight in the early months of life is greater than subse- 
quently, but roughly it may be said that throughout the 
twelve months of infancy the average increase is one 
pound a month (12 Ibs. + 7 Ibs. at birth =19 Ibs.). 
We have taken that as a standard, with the following 
result : 

Out of 169 infants who have used the milk, 118 have 
attended more than one month, and of these 95 (80*5 Per 
cent.} have each gained on an average more than half a 
pound per month, and on a total average i6 02. per month, 
the remaining 23 (19*5 per cent.} have each gained on an 
average less than half a pound per month. 

Secondly, as to the deaths. There were 13 cases of 
death out of the 169 infants. Three of these were children 
brought in a dying condition, and at special and urgent 
request were given a little of the milk for a few days before 



304 INFANT MORTALITY 

the fatal issue. Thirteen deaths yield an infant death 
rate per 1,000 births of 76 - 9, but if these three exceptional 
cases be excluded the death rate is 59*1 per 1,000 
births. 1 The Infant Milk Depot in Liverpool, which 
is the largest in this country, has yielded an infant death 
rate of 89 per 1,000 births. The average age at com- 
mencement of the use of the milk at Liverpool has been 
four and a half months, whereas in Finsbury it has been 
three and a half months, and more than half the infants 
were admitted under the age of three months, and more 
than a quarter were under six weeks of age. The per- 
centage of admissions of sickly children has been probably 
somewhat higher than at Liverpool. 

From the records of the 13 deaths it will be found 
that all these infants were admitted to the depot more or 
less seriously ill, three of them practically dying, and 
brought as a last resource. Seven out of the 13 deaths 
were due to epidemic diarrhoea, directly or indirectly. 

It is now necessary to consider somewhat more closely 
the effect of the milk upon the infants at the depdt. For 
convenience they are divided into four classes, as follows : 

A. Infants who have shown steady improvement 

throughout. 

B. Infants who, whilst taking the milk, suffered from 

epidemic diarrhoea and the results of the attack. 

C. Infants brought to the depot suffering from epi- 

demic diarrhoea and who recovered on the milk. 

D. Infants brought to the depot suffering from grave 

constitutional disease, and for whom this milk- 
feeding has done little or nothing. 

1 In 1905 the infant mortality rate for Finsbury was 148-6, and for 
London 131*1. The infant mortality rate of children at the depot at 
Fecamp in 1894-5 . was I2I > as compared with 240 for the town of 
Fecamp. In 1899 this had fallen to 70, as compared with 228 in Fecamp. 
At St. Helens (1899-1901) the depot-fed children had a death rate of 103 
per 1,000 births, as compared with 173 in the town of St. Helens. 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 305 

A. Infants who have shown steady improvement 
throughout. 

The following are six typical illustrations of thoroughly 
satisfactory cases : 

1. K. A. W., f., born October 3, 1904; began depot milk 
November 25, 1904 ; aged seven weeks. Health of mother, fair, 
anaemic ; first child ; insured. Occupation of father, cabinet 
maker; 403. per week. Sanitary conditions of house good. 
Three rooms; 6s. 6d. per week. Infant reported weight at 
birth, about 7^ Ibs. Weight on admission, 8 Ibs. Reason for 
admission mother had no milk. Condition of infant fair, 
thrush at time of admission ; slight eczema. Weight increased 
from 8 Ibs. 8 ozs. to 25 Ibs. in 12 months. Child did excellently 
throughout. Touch of diarrhoea in August lessened the steady 
rise for a month. (See Chart A.} 

2. C. E. C., m., born September 15, 1904; began depot milk 
December 1 7 ; aged three months. Mother's health good ; 
four other children, all living and healthy. Father, bookbinder, 
out of work. Family occupy two rooms ; rent, 45. 3d. ; sanitary 
conditions good. Infant reported weight at birth, 7^ Ibs. Had 
mother's milk for first fortnight, then cow's milk and barley 
water. On admission weight 8 Ibs., wasted and some eczema. 
Increased from 8 Ibs. to 20 Ibs. in 10 months. Reason why this 
child did not normally increase in weight during first three months 
of life, before admission to the depot, was illness and operation. 
After admission child did well throughout. (See Chart A.) 

3. A. H., f., born July 19, 1904; began depot milk December 
2nd, then aged 4^ months. Health of mother fairly good; 
dyspeptic. Three other children, all living and healthy. Insured. 
Family occupy whole house ; six living rooms and shop. Sani- 
tary conditions good. Infant premature ; reported weight at 
birth 5-6 Ibs. Had mother's milk for 3^ months, was then 
weaned, as she was not thriving. Had diarrhoea at time of 
weaning. General health fair, but much wasted and feeble. On 
admission weighed 8 Ibs. instead of 12 Ibs.; increased to 18 Ibs. 
2 ozs. in twelve months. Did excellently throughout. (See 
Chart A.}

306 INFANT MORTALITY 

4. R. W., f., born July 25, 1904; began depot milk December 
1 6th; aged nearly five months. Insured. Mother's health 
good; five other children, four living and healthy, one died 
(prematurity, lived only fifteen minutes). Father, carman, 
wages 2os. Family occupy three rooms, rent 55. 3d. Sanitary 
conditions good. Infant reported weight at birth, 6-J Ibs. ; had 
mother's milk for one month, then mother had influenza and lost 
milk, after which the child had Nestle's milk and barley water. 
Wasted after weaning. On admission weighed 10 Ibs., and 
increased to 18 Ibs. in seven months. Did well throughout, but 
had epidemic diarrhoea in the last month, which somewhat 
lessened the steady increase in weight. 

5. F. R. H., f., born November 23, 1904; began depot milk 
June 17, 1905; aged nearly seven months: insured. Mother's 
health good. Has had one other child, which died of diarrhoea 
and sickness at five months of age. Father, engraver, piecework, 
makes up to 405. ; one room, rent 53. Infant reported weight 
at birth, 8 Ibs. Has always been subject to bronchitis. Had 
mother's milk for six weeks, and then Nestle's milk in addition. 
On admission weighed 13 Ibs., and increased to 18 Ibs. in 
4^ months. Had more or less bronchitis all the time, otherwise 
did very well. 

6. E. L., f., born April 6, 1905 ; began depot milk gth June ; 
aged two months. Mother has been in hospital several times 
with gastric ulcer, and a year before the birth of the baby had 
severe haematemesis. Was aged 40 at the birth of this, the first 
child. Father, engine driver in a brewery, wages 303. Occupy 
three rooms; rent 75. 6d. Exceptionally clean and well kept. 
Infant reported weight at birth, 10^ Ibs. Had Nestle's milk 
since birth. On admission weighed n Ibs. and increased to 
19 Ibs. 12 ozs. by April 25th. 

Respecting this group of cases, comment is needless. 
These six infants represent many others who have passed 
through the depot, and have done well from the beginning. 
As a rule they have been put on the standard modification 
for their respective ages, and in comparatively few cases has 
it been necessary to put them back on to the weaker milks.

B. The next group is constituted of Infants who whilst taking 
the milk suffered from epidemic diarrhea, and the results of 
the attack. 

7. F. M. C, f., born November 26, 1904; began depot milk 
February 28, 1905 ; aged three months. Mother has good health. 
Father died of phthisis when the baby was two weeks old ; four 
other children living and healthy. The family of five live in one 
large room (one is in an Orphan Home), fairly clean and tidy ; 
rent 43. 6d. Not insured. Infant had had good health, no ill- 
ness or diarrhoea ; reported weight at birth, 6 Ibs. Had mother's 
milk for a little over three weeks, then cow's milk and barley 
water. Condition on admission fairly well nourished ; no 
diarrhoea. Weight at first attendance, gf Ibs. During the first 
eleven weeks that she had the milk she did well, gaining 2f Ibs. 
Then she gradually took less milk, and was occasionally sick, 
with short attacks of diarrhoea. She also began to waste. The 
diarrhoea was never continuous, but recurred repeatedly. The 
child was therefore put on a lower modification of milk, combined 
with medicinal treatment by a medical practitioner. During her 
illness the child was always very languid, and took hardly any 
milk, till, in September, she only weighed what she did at the 
start (9! Ibs.). She was still kept on very dilute milk. At last 
she began to improve, the diarrhoea and sickness ceased entirely, 
she took all the milk well, was bright and contented, and rapidly 
gained weight. Went off depot February 2nd, weighing 
15 Ibs. 4 ozs. (See Chart B.) 

8. E. S., f., born March 9, 1905 ; began depot milk July i$th ; 
aged four months. Health of mother, fair; has had six other 
children (one died at two years of diphtheria). Father, carman. 
The family of eight occupy two rooms ; rent 75. ; fairly clean and 
well looked after. Infant not been ill but did not get on and 
increase in weight ; reported weight at birth, 5^ Ibs. On admis- 
sion weighed 8 Ibs. 10 ozs. Had thrush. Mother's milk alone 
for seven weeks, then cow's milk and water in addition. Was 
entirely weaned at 10 weeks, and then had cow's milk and barley 
water. Had an attack of epidemic diarrhoea in August, and took 
the depot milk badly and lost weight ( lb.). The child was 
therefore placed on a lower modification (f water) and at once

PREVENTIVE METHODS 309 

From these results three conclusions may be drawn. 
First, the feeding of infants on modified and sterilised milk 
does not necessarily prevent them from having epidemic 
diarrhoea, particularly in the third quarter of the year. 

Secondly, it is evident from a study of these cases that 
epidemic diarrhoea reduces the strength and weight of the 
infant even though it be fed on pure, properly modified 
milk. 

Thirdly, children properly fed on pure milk suffer from 
epidemic diarrhoea less than children fed in other artificial 
ways. During the third quarter of 1905 we had 57 chil- 
dren on the depot, 16 of them suffered from epidemic 
diarrhoea (28 per cent). They were in no way a selected 
set of children indeed, if anything they were much below 
the average of Finsbury children, for they were nearly all 
brought to the depot already ill. How does this 28 
per cent, compare with the Borough as a whole? We 
have no means of knowing exactly how many cases of the 
disease occurred in the Borough, as it is not notifiable. 
But we may obtain some guidance in the following way. 
In the whole Borough there were in the same third quarter 
of 1905, 702 births and 65 deaths from epidemic diarrhoea. 
It may be safely assumed that each death indicates at 
least five cases of the disease, which would give 325 cases 
of the disease in the Borough (or 46^2 per cent.). Further, 
the general fatality is less in the children properly fed on 
artificial lines than it is in improperly fed children. This 
fact would be enormously emphasised if it were possible to 
draw out the Borough infant death rate in two forms, 
namely, a death rate of breast-fed children and a death 
rate of artificially-fed children. But it is impracticable to 
state this accurately in figures. How great the difference 
between the death rates of the artificially-fed children at 
the depot and the artificially-fed children outside in the 
Borough would be is, however, clear when one remembers 



310 INFANT MORTALITY 

that out of the 146 children dying in the Borough, 115 
were artificially fed. 2 It is perfectly clear, therefore, that 
the high Borough infant death rate is mostly due 
to deaths of infants artificially fed. No one can study 
these figures and the clinical history of these dep6t-fed 
children without being satisfied (a) that such children 
suffer much less from epidemic diarrhoea than other arti- 
ficially-fed children, and () that they have a much lower 
fatality, even when they are attacked. And yet nearly all 
the depot children are of the poorest classes. All of them 
are artificially fed. All were living at home, and subject 
to precisely the same external conditions of life as the other 
children. All the conditions indeed were the same for both 
classes, except that the depot-fed children were receiving 
pure milk and proper supervision. 

C. The third group consists of infants brought to the depot 
suffering from Epidemic Diarrhoea and who recovered on 
the Milk. 

ii. E. B., born i6th January, 1905 ; began depot milk i2th 
August; aged 7 months. Not insured. Mother cook in P.H. 
Baby boarded out with a family of four persons who occupy four 
rooms ; rent 8s. Clean and well cared for. Infant reported at 
birth to have been small; weakly; always constipated. Had 
been fed on cow's milk and barley water since birth. Condition 
on admission : Had had epidemic diarrhoea for a month, pulled 
down and thin, skin hanging loose, wasted, discharge from right 
ear. Weight at first attendance, i2f Ibs. (standard weight at 
seven months is 15^ Ibs.). Started on a dilute milk ( water), 
suitable for three months' child. Has gone steadily ahead with 
the exception of one week, when she was admitted to hospital for 
mastoid abscess, during which time she lost \\ Ibs. Weight on

2 Out of the 146 dead infants, 63 died of epidemic diarrhoea in Finsbury 
in the third quarter of 1905, and of these 63 we were able to ascertain the 
method of feeding in 54 instances. Out of the 54 only 9 were breast-fed, 
45, or 83 per cent., being artificially fed.

These three typical cases, and those numbered 7, 8, 9, 
and 10, illustrate an elementary point of importance which 
must not be overlooked respecting the effect of a Milk 
Depot upon epidemic diarrhoea. It appears to be com- 



312 INFANT MORTALITY 

monly supposed that the use of sterilised milk is suitable 
treatment for an infant suffering from diarrhoea. That 
is not so. In acute epidemic diarrhoea milk should, as 
a rule, be stopped. The child should be fed for 24 hours 
on boiled water or weak barley water, and even when milk 
is again commenced it must be greatly diluted and low in 
percentage of casein. We have adopted this treatment 
in cases of acute diarrhoea. The child has been starved 
for a few hours in order to remove remnants of its last 
food and then fed on small quantities of a very dilute 
milk (two-thirds boiled water) which also contains only 
half the amount of casein present in ordinary human 
milk. The beneficial results of this feeding have ap- 
peared repeatedly, and may be seen also in the cases 
quoted. An infant Milk Dep6t is an institution that 
requires careful watching and controlling. It is not 
making the best of such a depot to distribute the milk 
indiscriminately, not only to any infant whether it can 
be breast-fed or not, but to any artificially-fed child, 
and particularly to infants suffering from epidemic 
diarrhoea.

fed on cow's milk since birth. On dep6t milk from February 
1 8th till its death, July 3151, gained only 17 ozs. in the four 
months during which it was weighed (standard gain for four 
months 75 ozs.) ; took milk well throughout till last fortnight. 
During the latter half of July had diarrhoea and sickness, and 
only took a small quantity of milk. Died July 3151 ; weight 
unknown. Certified cause of death was infantile enteritis, but 
also suffered from generalised tuberculosis. (See Chart D.) 

15. J. T. W., born 22nd February, 1905; began depot milk 
8th July; aged 4 J months. Insured. Health of mother poor; 
ill all through pregnancy; instrumental labour. Has had five 
other children, four living and well and one dead (at 7$ months 
of malnutrition). Father is a clothes salesman. The family of 
seven occupy two rooms ; rent 6s. 6d. ; bedding, &c., dirty, but 
children fairly clean and well looked after. Sanitary conditions 
fair. Infant not weighed at birth; very small, about 5$ Ibs. 
Has an imperfectly formed throat with a large double uvula; 
always regurgitates food through nose, and has much difficulty 
in swallowing. Has cried incessantly since birth. On admission 
weight 6f Ibs. (standard at same age, 12 Ibs.) Child emaciated 
with an aged appearance ; skin shrivelled ; seriously ill. Im- 
proved somewhat on the milk, especially at first, then during 
October had three abscesses two on right thigh, and one 
on left side of chest. Depot milk discontinued November i3th, 
as the mother was not satisfied with the child's progress ; weight 
8 Ibs. 14 ozs. (standard weight i6f Ibs.) (See Chart D.) 

These two cases represent a remnant of infants brought 
to the dep6t suffering from grave constitutional disease 
which neither breast milk, artificial milk, nor any other 
food could permanently alleviate. In such cases the 
dep6t, of course, failed to be of any real value, although it 
may somewhat have prolonged the short life of the infant 

Summary of Conclusions. The Finsbury Infant Milk 
Depot seems to illustrate some of (i) the essential prin- 
ciples upon which such work should be carried on, which 
may now be named : 



314 INFANT MORTALITY 

(a) Direct control of the milk at the farm ; 

(&) Treatment of the milk, whatever it may be, im- 
mediately after its yield, and before the contained 
micro-organisms have had time to multiply or 
secrete their products ; * 

(<;) Medical supervision of the depot and of the 
infants using the milk. 

(d) A discriminating and careful distribution of the 
milk only to children who cannot be breast-fed, and 
the use of a suitable modification for each child ; 

(e) The systematic study of the effect of the milk on 
each child, accompanied by medical examination 
and periodical weighing ; 

(/) The adoption of a policy of attempting to 
increase rather than decrease the sense of 
responsibility of the mother. 

(2) The milk used in the depot under consideration is 
prepared under exceptionally good conditions, but not 
such as cannot be adopted by other dairy farms. Not 
the least valuable part of the work which has been done 
seems to be the practical demonstration which it fur- 
nishes in model dairying, which could, and should, be 
more widely practised in this country. 

(3) As far as can be judged, the depot saved the livens 
of some children and strengthened the physical condition 
and constitution of others. Eighty-one per cent, of the 
children who consumed the milk for a period of not less 
than a month gained the standard average weight of one 
pound per month. Whilst it is admitted that an Infants' 
Milk Depot is only a palliative method of preventive 
medicine, these results show that under certain circum- 
stances it may be of substantial value in the reduction of 
infant death rates among a certain class. 

1 The importance of this matter is not sufficiently recognised by dairy- 
farmers generally. 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 315 

(4) There is evidence to show that the depdt has served 
as an important training school of infant management 
Its value in this respect, as well as in respect of nourishing 
and saving life, would appear to depend in large measure 
upon the personal assistance and advice of a skilled nurse 
in the homes of the children. 

(5) The history of the first year of this experimental 
depot, particularly the clinical record, confirms the view 
that infants, even when properly and well fed on artificial 
lines, may still suffer from one of the most preventable 
and fatal of children's diseases epidemic diarrhoea. It 
would therefore appear that, however much this disease 
may be spread by milk and undoubtedly such is the case 
it may also be communicated to infants in other ways. 
Uncleanliness in the home, and particularly the common 
use of articles known as " comforters " and other similar 
appliances which readily collect dust and dirt, may con- 
tribute largely to this result, especially in the summer 
months. The clinical records of depot-fed infants suf- 
fering from this disease further seem to indicate that with 
careful dieting the disease may often be prevented or 
cured, and death averted. No doubt there are points 
in the working of this experimental depot which are 
open to criticism ; but, on the whole, the results show 
an exceptional measure of success, and such as justify 
the establishment of similar dep6ts elsewhere. It is in 
view of the fact that this depot serves as a practical ex- 
periment in milk reform, and has been established on 
what seem to be, generally speaking, desirable lines, that 
so much space has been devoted to an account of it. 



CHAPTER XI 

PREVENTIVE METHODS: (ill.) THE ENVIRONMENT 

I ^ IN ALLY, a brief chapter must be added on the 
~^ preventive methods to be adopted for the improve- 
ment of the external sanitary conditions surrounding 
both mother and infant. The more essential matters are 
improved sanitation in the factory and in the home, urban 
cleanliness, and the control of the milk supply. 

" Progress in health in factory and workshop life," said 
Miss Anderson, H.M. Principal Lady Inspector of Fac- 
tories at the Home Office, " is mainly a question of raising 
the ordinary general hygiene." * Supervision of dangerous 
trades and the prohibition of women working immediately 
before and after confinement are, of course, of great value, 
but in the long run cleanliness, sufficient ventilation and 
light, freedom from dust and from extremes of tempera- 
ture, adequate and suitable provision of sanitary accom- 
modation, reasonable hours of labour, and more effort to 
apply the worker to the work for which she is most fitted, 
are of chief importance. Most of these desiderata are 
provided for in the Factory and Workshop Act, 1901, 
which, compared with early regulations at the beginning 
of last century, may be looked upon as one of the 
workers' great charters of freedom. Although no doubt

Q. 1518-

PREVENTIVE METHODS 317 

as time passes amendments are necessary, the principal 
d at the present time is a steady and uniform enforce- 
ment of the powers which Local Authorities possess in this 
and kindred enactments. The same may be said of the 
Public Health and Housing Acts. Many of their pro- 
visions remain a dead letter, owing to the supineness and 
vested interest which still exists in many local government 
bodies. Dampness, overcrowding, an absence of storage 
cupboards for food, ill-ventilation, and uncleanliness, are 
common features of much of the dismal tenement property 
of towns and even of cottages in the country, where the 
nation is attempting with only partial success to rear its 
children. The remedy of these matters lies in the direct 
line of health reform. 

Secondly, there is urban cleanliness. " For the reduc- 
tion of the mortality from diarrhoea," writes Dr. Scurfield 
"(which is one of the chief causes of the infantile 
mortality) and enteric fever we must look to measures 
which will bring about greater cleanliness in and around 
the houses. In particular we must push on with (i) the 
abolition of the privy-middens and the provision of 
water-closets and frequently emptied dust-bins ; (2) the 
reconstruction of defective drains and sewers ; (3) the 
better paving of streets and yards. Under this heading 
I wish to point out the need for dealing with the sink 
wastes in the case of back-to-back houses, the contents of 
which are discharged on the footpaths, and frequently 
have to run a long distance down the street gutter 
before they reach a street gulley. The common and 
not unnatural practice of the residents in such cases of 
throwing their slops out on to the street surface gives 
rise to an abominable smell, which is, of course, worse in 
hot weather." 1 To reduce dust and infective filth to a 
minimum these three matters need attention, and without 
1 Rep. on Health of Sheffield, 1904, p. 17. 



318 INFANT MORTALITY 

that reduction milk and other food will continue to be 
contaminated and infantile diarrhoea will result. But 
there is a fourth requirement, namely, effectual scavenging 
and cleansing of streets. Dr. Spottiswoode Cameron has 
shown the beneficial effect of such cleansing on the diar- 
rhceal death rate in Leeds, 1 and in other districts increased 
flushing of streets in the dusty weeks of August and the 
more rapid and effectual removal of refuse has apparently 
led to a similar reduction in the infant death rate from 
diarrhoea. We have already seen how the incidence of 
this disease declines in a wet summer, and Tyndall 
showed many years ago how organisms and particulate 
matter adhere to wet surfaces. Depending upon these 
simple facts, it would be well if local authorities and the 
community could co-operate together to secure a much 
higher standard of municipal cleanliness and the sub- 
stitution of wet scavenging for dry. 

Control of the Milk Supply. 

Thirdly, there is needed increased control of the milk 
supply. We have seen that infant mortality, and par- 
ticularly fatal .diarrhoea, chiefly affects infants fed on 
condensed milk and cow's milk, and only in the smallest 
degree those who are breast-fed. We have seen also 
how this fatality occurs mainly in the second and third 
trimesters of the first year of life, at the time of weaning, 
and that it falls in a less marked degree, or is quite absent, 
in children fed on pure milk. The more the problem of 
infant diarrhoea, as it occurs in the middle of the first 
year, is examined the more will stale, polluted milk, as 
consumed in towns, come under suspicion as one of the 
chief causes. " Contrast the suitability of this milk," 
writes Dr. Hope, "as an infant's food, after a longer or 

1 Public Health, October, 1900, pp. 33-36. 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 319 

shorter period of storage, with the breast milk of the 
mother. The breast milk of the mother is beyond any 
doubt peculiarly adapted, both chemically and physically, 
to the special requirements of her particular offspring, and 
changes as the needs of the infant change. It is fresh 
produced, in fact, as it is required ; it is adequately mixed ; 
the temperature is exactly what it ought to be ; but, above 
all, it has never been exposed to the air ; no atmospheric 
impurities have reached it, as it passes direct from the 
gland to the stomach of the infant, and is consequently 
bacteriologically pure." x 

There are, however, two other reasons necessitating 
reform of the milk supply the prevention of milk-borne 
epidemics, 2 and the desirability of increased consumption. 
The former has but little relation to infant mortality. The 
latter, on the other hand, is of considerable importance in 
this connection. It was recently estimated that the average 
consumption of milk per capita is 42 gallons annually. 
This figure is arrived at approximately on the total yield 
of four millions of milch cows. In 1892 Mr. R. H. Rew 
stated, however, that the annual consumption per capita 
in London was 11*5 gallons (0*25 pint per day), and in the 
country generally 197 gallons (0^43 pint per day).3 In a 
careful estimate made in Finsbury in 1903-4 I calculated 
that the annual consumption per head was about 10 
gallons (0*21 pint per day), but among the very poor not 
more than one-tenth of a pint per diem.4 Returns of this 
nature vary not only in correspondence with poverty and 
social position, but also in relation to the consumption 
of condensed milk, which in some places has shown a 
marked increase. An average of one-tenth of a pint is

320 INFANT MORTALITY 

not sufficient. Milk is the ideal food for children, and 
there can be no doubt at all that an enormous increase 
of its consumption by children would directly tend to 
improve the physique of the rising generation. Not a 
little of such physical deterioration as exists among 
working-class children is due to living in urban com- 
munities, with all that it entails, and not receiving 
sufficient milk nourishment. 

To improve and increase the milk trade is, then, a 
requirement of national concern, and is a strong reason 
why great efforts should be made to control the supply. 
It is a significant fact that the total dairy produce 
imported annually into Great Britain is valued at 
upwards of ^"30,000,000. The importation of condensed 
milk has exactly doubled during the last ten years, 1894- 
1903 (from four million to eight million imperial gallons), 
and during the same period an import trade in fresh milk 
has arisen amounting now to about 200,000 gallons a year. 
This may be but a cloud the size of a man's hand, but 
unless the British dairy trade wakes up the cloud may 
cover the sky. The control of the milk supply is therefore 
not only a method of preventive medicine, but a national 
requirement. 

There are three broad principles which may be sub- 
mitted as governing the question. First, in a general way 
some reform should come from the consumer. What the 
public demand the trade will supply. If the public insists 
on a pure whole milk obtained by cleanly methods from 
healthy, clean cows, there is no doubt the supply can be 
provided. Secondly, some reform should come from the 
trade. This should be from inside rather than outside, 
from the dairyman rather than from the Act of Parlia- 
ment. The milk trade would do well to learn the vast 
importance of co-operation in the development of what 
should be a great national industry. A perusal of the 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 321 

conditions and regulations of the dairy companies in Den- 
mark, America, and Great Britain serves to illustrate what 
can be done in this respect, and their enterprise has largely 
led the way in milk reform. Thirdly, there is the sphere 
of the Legislature, which should take, I contend, a large 
view of the question, making the aim to control by 
development rather than by restraint, by encouraging 
rather than hindering the trade, whilst at the same time 
insisting upon a pure milk rather than adopting counsels 
of perfection in respect of cowsheds. What is needed in 
this country is not so much more legislation in respect of 
milk as a direct and uniform application and enforcement 
of the legislation which now exists. 1 

Now, whilst these general ' principles seem to indicate 
the path of advance, there are some details of importance. 
The requirement is a pure milk supply that is, a clean 
whole milk, unadulterated and unsophisticated, and without 
preservation, derived from healthy cows living under clean 
and sanitary conditions, and protected from contamination 
(dust and dirt) and infection (agents and products of 
disease). The details of control involve milk production, 
conveyance, and distribution. 

(a) Milk Production. -The importance of commencing 
the control of milk at the beginning can scarcely be over- 
estimated. If the cow be diseased or unclean nothing can 
correct the unsatisfactory character of the milk. Milking 
herds, their breeding and management, call for more atten- 
tion than they have yet received in this country. 

From an administrative point of view it is important to 
emphasise the need for regular, frequent, and systematic 
veterinary inspection of all cows used for dairy purposes 
(for the detection of vesicular eruptions of the udder and 
teats, the elimination of diseased cows, tuberculin test, &c.). 

' Bacteriology of Milk, 1903, PP- 452-543 (for needed amendments see 
pp. 471-472 and p. 543). 
y 



322 INFANT MORTALITY 

It is noteworthy to witness the improvement in dairy cattle 
(as, for instance, in the London cowsheds) where inspection 
is properly carried out. Two further points have relation 
to general sanitation of cowsheds and to milking and the 
after-treatment of milk. It is evident what the intention 
of the Legislature was in introducing the Dairies, Cow- 
sheds, and Milkshops Orders (1885, 1886, and 1899), and 
in inserting various Regulations as to cubic space, &c., 
though it is not clear why the Regulations are made per- 
missive or the Order allowed to remain so much a dead 
letter as it is. The really essential matters are not exact 
limits of cubic capacity, but thorough cleanliness and 
sanitation, coupled with a decent water supply, conditions 
which do not as a rule obtain. A model dairy does not 
require a large outlay of capital, but it requires a keen 
intelligence and unremitting care in its management. It 
is not expensive structural alterations which are needed, 
nor elaborate cowsheds, nor special water supplies laid on 
at great expense, but it is thorough cleanliness. A pol- 
luted water readily leads to a polluted milk, and is 
frequently at the bottom of unclean dairying, even as 
insufficient light in the byre leads to uncleanliness. One 
of the first steps towards reform of milk production is 
reform of rural water supplies, and the direction in which 
such improvement is required is not so much in the pro- 
vision of new supplies as in the protection from surface 
contamination of the supplies which exist. 

In the second place, there is the method of milking. 
The greatest possible care and cleanliness should be 
observed in every detail connected with the work of 
milking. The hind-quarters and udder of the cow 
should be kept clean. In autumn, before the cows are 
housed, the long hair on the tail, udder, and hind-quarters 
should be clipped, and the cow also regularly groomed. 
The practice of milking in the field during summer is 






PREVENTIVE METHODS 323 

strongly recommended. The passing of the female milker 
is to be regretted, for now it happens that frequently odd 
men about the farm are employed as milkers amongst 
their other functions. They are often ill-trained, and 
unclean in person and manipulation. Yet the milker 
should be clean in all respects. He should, of course, 
be free from infectious disease of any kind, including 
tuberculosis. 

In respect to treatment of milk after milking, the 
Danes recognise in a manner and to an extent at present 
unknown generally in Great Britain that the destruction 
and inhibition of bacterial activity in milk is the basis of 
all successful dairying. They recognise the multitudinous 
opportunities which milk has of becoming polluted from 
the time it leaves the udder of the cow to the time it 
reaches the consumer's mouth, and that milk is a highly 
favourable medium, and, therefore, the bacteria which gain 
access multiply at an enormous rate. In consequence of 
this knowledge the Danes adopt three simple rules. First, 
prevent organisms gaining access by cleanly methods of 
dairying ; secondly, strain thoroughly ; thirdly, inhibit by 
refrigeration the growth of such organisms as may have 
by accident gained access to the milk. Clean milking, 
careful straining, immediate cooling, are the cardinal 
principles of the dairy creed. Whatever treatment milk 
is to receive it should receive at once. One of the 
greatest mistakes is to suppose that milk may be treated 
after it has stood or travelled for ten or twelve hours. 
Refrigeration or sterilisation is then too late to gain the 
highest advantage. A pure milk from the outset is vastly 
better than a milk subsequently sterilised. Many of the 
so-called " sterilised " milks now on the market are open 
to grave criticism, partly because they are frequently not 
sterile, and partly because they are dirty milks. Sterilisa- 
tion does not purify a dirty milk. It cannot be too clearly 



324 INFANT MORTALITY 

understood that what is required is a pure milk from the 
beginning, and all through the dairying process. 

() Milk Conveyance. For town supplies the question 
of railway transit is of importance. As a rule, most of 
the milk conveyed on the English railways is carried in 
special milk-trains. Some of it, in small quantities, is 
conveyed in vans attached to passenger trains, and a small 
amount by the ordinary goods trains. Generally speaking, 
the heavy milk traffic passes at night-time. Rates are low, 
and probably the gross revenue of all the railway com- 
panies for carrying milk to London is under half a million. 
Viewed from the railway standpoint, therefore, the traffic 
is not worth exceptional consideration. There is lack 
of co-operation and organisation in the trade, which is 
necessary to make the trade a good customer to the 
railways. Viewed from the dairyman's standpoint, there 
are grievances against some of the railway companies, 
which may be summarised by saying that the trade re- 
quires (though frequently it is ignorant of the require- 
ment) : (a) quick transit ; (&} sealed churns ; and (c) 
milksheds at loading stations. These conditions are 
provided in other countries, and they ought to be pro- 
vided in England. Railway transit in Great Britain is 
alleged to be bad rather than slow, porterage at the 
stations is frequently left to the trade, milk is sometimes 
packed with other articles such as fish, watercress, and 
general goods, and frequently is kept at such a tempera- 
ture throughout the journey that it either arrives sour or 
readily sours. The existence of these conditions has led 
to all sorts of suggestions as to enforcing railway companies 
by law to do this, that, and the other, which is surely 
unreasonable. The railway companies in America and in 
Denmark have had to meet a demand from the trade, not 
an Act from the Legislature ; and they have met it. 
Reform of railway transit of milk must spring from an 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 325 

organised trade able to be a good customer. Then the 
companies will become their servants. They cannot give 
an efficient and express service for a few churns or an odd 
wagon here and there, which would necessarily be costly, 
whilst at the same time the milk rates are low. What is 
required is co-operation on the part of farmers and milk- 
producers of a district for the carrying on not of a casual 
business from many centres, but a well-organised trade 
from a few centres, and by efficient dairying to raise the 
quantity and quality of milk per district. Railway com- 
panies will respond when there is business, and when they 
respond may they remember the three cardinal principles 
of efficient transit of milk : (i) Cleanliness and absence of 
dust contamination of the nfilk ; (2) shortness of time of 
transit, every hour lost being detrimental to a living fluid 
like milk ; and (3) lowness of temperature. 

(c) Milk Sale and Distribution. In New York milk is 
sold from 12,000 stores, or an average of one store to 
every 286 persons. In London the average works out at 
about one milkshop to every 500 persons. These milk- 
shops are of two kinds : (a) Dairies or shops selling dairy 
produce only, and (b} general shops selling milk in addition 
to a variety of articles, often including spices, herrings, 
soap, firewood, paraffin oil, blacking, and many articles 
creating a dusty atmosphere. It is probably correct to say 
that the former, the dairies, constitute less than 20 per cent, 
of all the milk-selling premises, taking London as a whole. 
This state of affairs gravely complicates the effort to obtain 
a pure milk supply. But unfortunately there is no direct 
power conferred on the local authorities, who are respon- 
sible for registration of milkshops, of refusing to grant 
registration to unsuitable shops. Clause 6 of the Dairy 
Order of 1885 enacts that every local authority shall keep 
a correct register of all milk sellers and purveyors in their 
district, and they shall register every such person who 



326 INFANT MORTALITY 

applies. It would be desirable that the Local Authority 
should have direct power of refusing registration to 
unsuitable persons or premises. In the meantime it is 
important that local authorities should raise the standard 
of sanitation and cleanliness required in milkshops under 
Clauses 8 to 13 (including Regulations) of the Public 
Health (London) Act, 1891, Section 28, and thus compel 
the general salesman, who only sells insignificant quan- 
tities of milk, to discard the sale of milk or bring his shop 
into line with the dairies in standard of sanitation and 
cleanliness. In relation to this matter of sanitation in 
milkshops, it should also be understood that milk becomes 
contaminated in milkshops because it is not sufficiently 
protected. It is placed in a counter-pan so constructed as 
to expose a large surface of milk to dust contamination. 
Constant dipping, flies, and dust from the shop and street 
serve in a remarkable degree to contaminate the milk. 
Probably the time is approaching for a more general 
adoption of bottled milk. 

A perusal of Bulletin 46, issued by the Bureau of 
Animal Industry at Washington, shows how far America 
is in advance of Great Britain in respect of the control of 
the milk supply, particularly in the following respects : 
(a) The increasing use of bottled fresh milk ; () the 
diminution in the practice of pasteurisation, the Ameri- 
cans having learned that pure milk is preferable to 
pasteurised milk ; (c) the enforcement of the dairy laws ; 
(</) the beneficial results of thorough examination and 
inspection j 1 and (e) the value of the careful collection 

1 At the same time as instituting measures of bacteriological examina- 
tion and inspection, the Sale of Food and Drugs Act should continue to 
be pressed into the work of protecting milk. Irregular sampling, Sunday 
sampling, and more frequent sampling are required. Adulteration of milk 
is changing in process rather than becoming less. Mixing of separated 
and whole milk, and of condensed and cow's milk, is now probably more 
common than the grosser method of simply adding water to increase volume. 
It is becoming increasingly desirable to obtain some legislation on the lines 
of the Departmental Committee's Report on Preservatives, 1901. 



PREVENTIVE METHODS 327 

of facts respecting milk. It is not too much to say that 
America has gained a march upon us even in the matter 
of reports. A record like the American report ' if made 
in this country would lead to such an inquiry into the 
methods of the milk trade as would of itself exert a most 
beneficial effect throughout the country. The public 
needs more information, more knowledge of the exact 
condition of things, and it would very speedily demand 
reform. 

It must further be mentioned in connection with milk 
distribution that home contamination requires attention. 
The poor have no pantries, and the milk is stored in dirty 
vessels exposed to dust and other uncleanness. Education 
on domestic hygiene in elementary schools and teaching 
the importance of the use of milk by lady inspectors and 
health visitors would assist in securing progress in the 
right direction.

THE 

CARE AND FEEDING OF INFANTS. 



FEEDING. 

Thousands of infants die every year from improper feeding. 

If the mother has plenty of breast milk, the infant 
should not have any other food until it is gradually 
weaned during- the 8th or pth month. During the first 2 
months it should not be suckled oftener than every 2 hours, 
and after the 3rd month not oftener than every 3 hours. 
Regularity in feeding is most important. Do not feed between 
meals "just to keep the baby quiet." 

During the suckling period the mother requires good plain 
wholesome food, including milk or milk puddings. Beer or 
other stimulants are not desirable unless ordered by the doctor. 

If the mother has not sufficient milk, it should be supple- 
mented with cow's milk and water, or barley water, made as 
below. 

If the mother cannot suckle her child, it should be fed 
with cow's milk and water, or barley water, with a little sugar 
added (as below). Skimmed milk should not be used. It is 
best to boil the milk, especially in summer. 

During the first fortnight. Boil together pint of 
fresh milk, pint of water, and a small tablespoonful of 
sugar, and keep in a clean corked bottle or covered jug. 
Three tablespoonfuls of this should be given every 2 hours. 

Between 2 weeks and 2 months. Boil together 
pint milk, f pint of water, and a tablespoonful of sugai 
Five tablespoonfuls should be given every 2 hours. 

During the 3rd and 4th months. Boil together f 
pint milk, f pint water, and a tablespoonful of sugar. 
Eight tablespoonfuls to be given every z\ or 3 hours. 



APPENDICES 345 

During 5 th to pth months. Boil together i pint of 

iilk( 5 th month), ij pint (6th month), r pint of milk 

J7tt o 9 th month), with pint water, and a tablespoonful 

sugar. 10 to 12 tablespoonfuls to be given every 3 hours. 

Use a boat-shaped feeding bottle, with a rubber teat and 

KO tube. After each feed the bottle and teat should be 

well washed in hot water and soda, and kept in clean water. 

Never keep food over in the bottle for the next meal. 

At 9 months old the milk may be thickened with one or two 

tablespoonfuls of cornflour, and some broth or beef tea may be 

ven. At 10 months old the child may have bread and milk 

1 and butter, and cornflour or porridge, but not meat. 
Children require plenty of milk until the age of 3 years 
as they cannot digest the same food as grown-up persons. 
After 1 8 months they may have fresh fish, gravy and 
read crumbs, eggs, &c., once a day. Do not give them 
beer, spirits, wine, cheese, pickles, pastry, fruits, nuts, 
or sweets. 

Do not give them teething powders, sleeping draughts, 
or soothing syrups. 

II. 
GENERAL REQUIREMENTS. 

Keep infants warm with flannel underclothing, and take them 
out during the day whenever it is fine, but not at night. 

Fresh air and sunlight are nearly as important as food. 

If they can be kept sufficiently warm they should sleep in 
cots or cradles, rather than in bed with parents ; a clean box, 
such as an orange box, or a clothes basket will do, if a cradle 
is not readily obtainable. Many babies are overlaid every year 
from sleeping with their parents. 

Wash them all over at least once a day with soap and warm 
water. 

Rooms should be kept very clean and well ventilated, 

and the windows open at the top.

APPENDIX XIV. 

ELEMENTARY COUNSELS TO MOTHERS AND 
NURSES. ' 

(Edited and completed by the Commission on the Hygiene of 
Infancy of the Academy of Medicine, Paris.) 

NATURAL FEEDING. 

. i. The breast-feeding of the new-born infant by the mother, 
or, in her default, by a wet-nurse under the eyes of the family, 
is the method of nourishment which gives the most happy results, 
and diminishes to the utmost the chances of the infant dying. 

2. Milk must constitute the principal nourishment of the 
infant during its first year at least, that is to say, until the appear- 
ance of the first 10 or 12 teeth. It is dangerous to give a solid 
nourishment to the infant during the first month. It must not 
be forgotten that it is premature feeding which makes the most 
victims among young infants. 

3. During the two days following birth, and while waiting 
for the milk to come into the breasts of the mother, or the 
arrival of the wet-nurse, the infant may be fed with warm, 
slightly sweetened, water. 

4. From the time that it takes the breast the infant should 
be fed every two hours, and less frequently during the night. 
The number of meals, however, should be apportioned to its 
needs, its appetite, and its strength. 

5. An infant should never be awakened to give it the breast 
unless it should be very weak, or that its sleep is prolonged for 
more than three hours during the day, or five or six hours during 
the night. 

6. It is very dangerous for the mother, or the nurse, to allow 
the infant to sleep in their bed, and the doctor should prohibit 
this absolutely. 

7. In case of pregnancy every mother, or nurse, must gradually 
cease to nurse the child so as not to endanger its health. 

1 From Dr. Moore's Special Report on Infant Mortality in Huddersfield, 
1905, in which will be found further instructions of a similar nature. 



APPENDICES 347 

MIXED FEEDING. 

8. In case of the mother not having enough milk, or of her 
ill-health, one may, after two or three months, or even earlier in 
certain circumstances, alternate the meals two or three times in 
the twenty-four hours with artificial foods according to the 
following rules. 

ARTIFICIAL FEEDING. 

9. If the mother cannot feed the child and if a wet-nurse 
cannot be procured, the infant must be nourished with the milk 
of an animal (ass, cow, or goat). From the second day after 
birth one gives, it may be, the milk of an ass, it may be when 
this cannot be obtained, goat's or cow's milk, with water added. 
This milk should be taken when it is possible from that first 
drawn, and from an animal recently delivered. 

10. The dilution of the milk of the cow, or the goat, must be 
made with pure boiled water, and not with infusions or decoc- 
tions. Except in the case of illness (see further on) this dilution 
must be made, and given, in the following proportions. 

11. During the first week, half milk and half water, two or 
three tablespoonfuls every two hours, thenceforward until the 
end of the second month, two-thirds milk and one-third water, 
four or five tablespoonfuls every two hours according to the 
tolerance of the stomach. From the commencement of the second 
month the dilution of the milk may be reduced to one-fourth, 
and the dose of the liquid increased to a half-glass about every 
two hours. At the third and following months one glassful should 
be given every three hours. It is not until the end of the third 
month that the milk should be given pure. 

12. The quantity of diluted or pure milk varies also according 
to the appetite, the digestion, and the state of health or sickness 
of the infant, and also according to the strength and purity of 
the milk. 

13. The quantity of cow's or goat's milk required for the feeding 
of the child for 24 hours must be sterilised daily after having been 
diluted. This sterilisation should be practised regularly by the 
person in charge of the infant. 

14. Whatever may be the vessel used for boiling the milk, it 



348 APPENDICES 

must not be of tin or lead, and if the feeding-bottle is used 
it should not be stopped with vulcanised rubber. A tube feeding- 
bottle is fatal, and must be absolutely prohibited. The same 
feeding-bottle must never be used for several infants. 

15. These different vessels must never contain more than the 
quantity of milk necessary for a single repast, and the residue 
must be thrown out, as it may be soured. 

1 6. The vessels also shall be cleaned with care every time that 
they are used, and maintained in a state of extreme cleanliness. 
In the intervals between feeding, the bottle must be kept in 
boiled water. If these indispensable precautions are not taken, 
the milk newly placed in the vessels will become altered and will 
soon cause those accidents colics and diarrhoeas which are the 
principal cause of the mortality of infants. 

17. It is for the same reason that one must avoid the use of 
"comforters" of whatever nature, such as one too frequently has 
the habit of leaving between the lips of children to calm them. 

1 8. It must be remembered that artificial feeding consider- 
ably augments the chances of sickness and death when it is not 
practised in the family with minute care and by experienced 
persons. 

19. Artificial feeding, already dangerous in itself, becomes 
more so as the result of crowding when it is carried on in the 
same place and with a large number of children. 

20. Towards the seventh month one may add to sterilised milk 
either the yolks of eggs, baked flour of wheat, starch, oats, or 
tapioca, first of all made into clear stews, and always well cooked, 
and later on one may replace the milk by weak beef tea. 

21. Speaking generally the various compositions recom- 
mended by commercial undertakings to replace milk should be 
abstained from. 

WEANING. 

22. Weaning may be effected at the end of the ninth month, 
and even earlier if circumstances render it necessary; for example, 
when the milk of the mother or the wet-nurse becomes insufficient. 
But when the conditions of breast feeding remain satisfactory, it 
is preferable not to wean the infant until after the tenth month, 
or even after the first year. 



APPENDICES 349 

23. All solid food should be excluded from the practice of 
weaning until dentition is more or less advanced. It should not 
be carried out when the child is feverish nor during teething, 
nor during any illness of the child. During the interval of 
calm which separates the appearance of teeth, weaning may be 
commenced. 

24. Weaning should be effected by degrees. 

25. When weaning is accomplished the nourishment should be 
rendered more substantial little by little, by adding bread soaked 
in the juice of meat, or purges of farinaceous vegetables; but 
meat should not be given until the appearance of the first back 
teeth. Also cakes, all sorts of sweets, wines, and liquors should 
be kept out of the foods of infants. 

26. Weaning only requires for the mother, or the nurse, a little 
attention at the moment when they cease completely to give the 
breast ; a few purgatives, and diuretic and acidulated drinks. 

HYGIENE AND CLOTHING. 

27. As soon as the child is born the midwife should especially 
wash the eyes with warm boiled waier. The child should be 
reared in a room as well aired as possible, and sufficiently warmed 
in winter. 

28. No child should be taken out until the fifteenth day, except 
the external temperature should be very mild and dry. It is not 
to be forgotten that it is by the respiration of a too cold, or too 
sharp, air that the infant contracts bronchitis. 

29. The toilette of the infant should be made every morning 
before it is put to the breast, or given food. The toilette consists 
of a bath or washing of the body (above all of the genital organs), 
and the seat (which must always be kept very clean), washing the 
head, and changing the linen. The binder must be retained for 
the first month. 

30. The " maillot complet " must be absolutely rejected ; that 
is to say, the garment which envelops and binds together with 
the aid of bands, &c., the four limbs and body, because the more 
liberty the infant has in its movements, the more it becomes 
robust and well formed. Reject also every bandage which 
includes the head. 



350 APPENDICES 

31. The child must always be clothed more or less warmly 
according to the country which it inhabits and to the seasons, 
but it must always be preserved with care from cold and from 
excessive heat either out of doors or indoors. 

32. The child should not be allowed to walk too soon. It 
should be allowed to pull itself about on the floor with its own 
strength, and to lift itself up. The use of go-carts should be 
rejected. 

33. The indispositions of children, such as cough, colics, 
diarrhoea, and vomiting, should never be neglected. A doctor 
should be called in from the onset. 

34. It is indispensable to have the child vaccinated in the first 
three months, or even earlier in the presence of an epidemic of 
small-pox. Vaccination is the only certain preservative against 
this malady. 

APPENDIX XV. 
INFANT LIFE PROTECTION ACT, 1897. 

The chief provisions of this Act are as follows : 

1. Any person retaining or receiving for hire or reward more 
than one infant under the age of five years for the purpose of 
nursing or maintaining such infants apart from their parents 
for a longer period than forty-eight hours, shall give notice 
thereof to the Local Authority. Such notice shall state the
