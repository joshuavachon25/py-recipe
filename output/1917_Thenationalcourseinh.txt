Introduction 

A home-maker must be a housekeeper or at least understand what 
good housekeeping is. Those women who have been engaged in the study 
of home-making have grown to feel that it is a profession, a thing of so 
great importance that it calls for years of careful preparation and earnest 
study. The general impression exists that a girl can grow up without any 
knowledge of cooking and housework and when the time comes fall into 
domestic ways and become a good home-maker. 

Women have always kept house — hence the conclusion that home- 
keeping is woman's natural province, for the duties of which no especial 
training is necessary. In our early days a girl's opportunities were very 
limited and there was plenty of time for them to become proficient in the 
duties of home-making. In these days the changed economic conditions 
and greater educational opportunities have brought about great changes 
and we find women on an equality with man and practically economically 
independent of him. However, though she may be a teacher, stenogra- 
pher, bookkeeper, etc., she will nevertheless finally fulfill her real mission 
in life and become a wife and home-maker. 

These lessons of the National School of Home Economics have been 
prepared to supplement the work being done in the schools and to give 
the busy housewife the advantages of instruction and help based upon the 
best thought in the Science of Home Economics. The correspondence 
privilege extended to members, as per terms of certificate, affords an oppor- 
tunity to keep posted as to new ideas, new styles, new dishes, etc., which 
will prove of great value. 

The High Cost of Living has been kept in mind in the preparation of 
these studies. The lessons on Home Dressmaking, on Home Millinery, 
etc., cannot help being fully appreciated by all who practice economy and 
who still desire to conform to conventional styles. 

vii 



viii INTRODUCTION 

The lessons on Preparation and Cooking of Food will be found espe- 
cially helpful in producing nutritious meals at a minimum of cost. The 
instructions on Home Management, including proper furnishing of the 
home, How and What to Feed Infants, Simple Remedies for Prevalent 
Disorders, Special Food for the Sick and Convalescent, Toilet Sugges- 
tions and Recipes will help lessen the perplexities of all who use them as 
a guide and stimulate that just pride without which great excellence is 
impossible. 

The final plea of the Director is that you make these lessons the "dic- 
tionary of your domestic affairs" — consult them freely, regulate the home 
accordingly, but do not forget that you can only keep abreast of the times, 
can only be the up-to-date home-maker by continuing your studies of home 
economics, and that the benefits of our School are yours for the asking. 

Believe me, at your service, 

RUTH ALLEN BEEZLEY, 
Director National School of Home Economics.

LESSON I 
THE HARMONY OF DRESS AND HINTS ON BUYING 

*'TT is much to know fine clothing from poor, to be a judge of values, 
I to buy with taste." We need only to look around us a short distance 
to see that a few suggestions on the subject of harmony in dress will 
not go amiss. We are desirous of being fashionable to the degree that Vv'e 
begin to overlook individuality in the matter of dress. For instance, if 
we see that purple is to be the fashionable color of the season, all of us feel 
that we must have purple. There are very few colors w^iich every woman 
can wear becomingly. What v/ill suit one complexion very seldom does 
for another, and for this reason we should study ourselves wath regard to 
harmony of color in dress. 

It would be impossible to set a scheme of colors for every type, for 
the shading from the brunette to the blonde is too gradual. 

We may, however, make a general classification, dividing ourselves 
into three big classes, the blonde, the light brunette or medium, and the 
dark brunette. Under this classification a few general rules may be set 
as a foundation upon which a more elaborate scheme may be enlarged 
upon to suit the individual case. 

The blonde may wear light blue, light shades of green, dull gold, 
and neutral shades of any color rather than positive ones. Avoid red, 
orange, yellow, purple, and brown. 

The pale bruiietfe is in need of warm colors, although here again 
neutral colors are better than positive ones. Warm brown, gold color, 
maize, old rose, and modified red are good. Light blue and green, pale 
violet, and all hues of purple and pink are colors that should be avoided. 

For tlie brunette, red, maroon, dark blue, rich maize, yellow, and gold 
color are becoming. 

Never wear light blue, light green, pale violet, purple, or pink. 

All may wear white, and black with white trimming. 

In addition to personality being observed in the choice of color, the 
same degree of care should be taken in the style of pattern used. 

The short, stout woman should wear dresses with long lines. Ruffles, 
frills, or any trimming which would tend to shorten the general length 
of the garment should not be used. An extremely tight-fitting garment 
emphasizes the size of the wearer. 

.7 



8 HOME DRESSMAKING 

The tall, thin woman should also leave tight-fitting garments alone. 
Only the normal size woman can afford to wear this style. Long lines 
should be broken as much as possible in the clothes of the thin woman. 
Crosswise trimming is best. 

The best material that can be afforded should be put in dresses, for 
cheap material is usually lacking in firmness and the garments made from 
it soon lose their shape. 

It is best to patronize reliable firms, for in the end their products 
are cheapest. Learn from personal inspection where the best in any cer- 
tain line is carried. One firm is often noted for its superior line of silks, 
while another may excel in woolens. 

In buying silk it is better to buy a soft, pliable piece than a heavier 
one which is weighted with foreign matter, for the softer piece will out- 
wear the other. Fray out some threads of silk and try them to see if they 
break easily. If they do, the silk is poor quality. Good silk will not 
wrinkle easily when crumpled in the hand. 

In the selection of woolens, never buy a rough, loosely woven piece, 
for when washed it will shrink and draw out of shape. Beware of a 
piece that has short ends which break away when raveled. 

When buying linen it is best not to lay in a stock too far ahead, for 
the bleaching in linen often affects its wearing quality. The threads in 
good linen should be long, round, and lustrous. When raveled the threads 
should not pull apart and fuzz, for this is a sign of cotton. It is better 
to buy a soft linen than one that has been made stiff by starch and sizing. 
Rub a little together in your hand to see if the stiffness remains. 

LESSON II 
DRESSMAKING EQUIPMENT 

After the careful purchasing of material, great care should be taken 
in the making of it. If possible, a separate room should be set aside 
for sewing. It should be a well-lighted, ventilated, and heated room, 
with varnished or linoleum-covered floors, which can be easily kept clean. 

A standard sewing machine, kept in good repair, a cutting table, an 
ironing board and iron, a few straight-back chairs, a large mirror, and a 
dress form are essential. 

Among the smaller articles which complete the dressmaker's outfit are 
a tape measure, a yard stick, a pin cushion filled with good sharp pins, two 
pairs of scissors, one large pair for cutting heavy material and another 



HOME DRESSMAKING 9 

smaller pair for general use, thimbles, a variety of thread, a good grade 
of medium and small needles, and an emery for sharpening them. A chest 
of drawers in which old patterns may be filed is convenient, for the mate- 
rial which is being worked upon may be folded and placed here over night 
to be kept free from dust. 

Always keep the room as neat and clean as possible, sweeping up the 
scraps from one garment before starting another. 

Patience must be observed in sewing. Learn to be accurate about 
every detail. Take measurements carefully — study and alter your pattern 
with the same degree of care that you use when you sew the trimming on 
the dress. Accurateness is essential to perfect-fitting garments. 

When sewing never sit in a stooped position. Sit nearly erect, hold- 
ing your work up to you, at a correct distance from your eyes. 

The number of the thread and needles used will always be deter- 
mined by the material being worked upon. It is best, however, to use 
as fine a needle as possible, for smaller stitches can be taken with it. Size 
six or seven is best for best basting, and eight for ordinary sewing. 

Always cut thread, never bite it. Use thread not longer than arm's 
length, for a longer thread is more apt to tangle and is not satisfactory. 



LESSON III 



SEWING STITCHES 

Basting is the temporary stitching which is used to hold two pieces 
of cloth together while the permanent stitching is put in. The basting 

must be carefully done, if the stitch- 
ing is to look well. There are three 
common kinds of basting, even, un- 
even, and diagonal. 

Even hasting is the taking of 
stitches of the same length, leaving 
spaces of equal length. 

Uneven hasting is made by tak- 
ing one long stitch and one or more 
short ones. This is used where there 
is not as much strain on the material 
xjNEVEN BASTING as there is in even basting.

HOME DRESSMAKING 




DIAGONAL OR CROSSWISE BASTING 




RUNNING STITCH 



_^ ^^ , Diagonal or crosswise hasting {?, 

\\\\\\\\VH' "I the taking of stitches of equal length, 
in a diagonal manner. This is used in 
basting a lining to an outer garment. 

When the strain is not great on 
a seam or when the material is too 
thick to conveniently make it on a 
sewing machine, or on a very expen- 
sive gown where handwork alone is 
desired, the permanent stitches are 
taken by hand. Those most fre- 
quently used are the running stitch, 
the back stitch, and the half-back 
stitch. 

The running stitch is made by 
taking stitches of equal length, as in 
even basting, but very much shorter 
than even basting stitches. This 
stitch is used where practically no 
strength is needed. 

The hack stitch, which is used to 
take the place of machine stitching, 
is made by taking a stitch backward 
on the upper side and one twice as 
long forward on the under side. 

Half hack stitching is made the 
same as back stitching, except that 
the back stitch on the upper side of 
the material is taken only half way 
back to the last stitch instead of all 
the way. It is used where there is 
not as much strain on the seam as 
there is in the back stitch. 

Raw edges of a seam that ravels 

easily are over-cast. Over-casting is 

a slanting stitch taken over the edge ; 

the needle should point to the left, 

and the threads should not be drawn very tight. The stitches should be 

less than a fourth of an inch long and the same distance apart. All edges 

of material should be trimmed smooth before over-casting.

OVER-HANDING 




CATCH STITCHING 



.^.V'^^^p^ ^ Oz'cr-handing is used to join two 

folded or selvedge edges. The stitches 
are very small and are taken over the 
edges, which have been basted evenly 
together. 

Catch stitching is used to finish 
seams or hold down seam edges. It 
is especially preferred to finish seams 
on flannel garments because it makes 
a smoother, less bunglesome seam 
than can be made otherwise. Leave 
the knot on the underneath of the 
material, on the side nearest you. 
Slant the thread across to opposite 
side and take a short stitch, including a few threads of material, to the right, 
having the needle point away from the thread. Then cross back, taking 
a similar stitch. 

Feather stitching is used to deco- 
rate undergarments, or when worked 
into a design it is often used on dainty 
waists and infants' dresses. Make 
the knot on under side of cloth ; hold 
the thread down in a straight line, 
then insert the needle a little to the 
left of this line and take a short, slanting stitch toward the line. Hold 
the thread down with the thumb while drawing the needle out over it. The 
second stitch is taken on the opposite side of the line, also slanting toward 
the line; the needle is inserted for the second stitch at the line level with 
the bottom of the first stitch. This may be varied by taking two or three 
stitches on the left before crossing to the right, and taking the same num- 
ber there, making a double or treble feather stitch. 




FEATHER STITCHING 



^^^^^^^^^^^^^f^mm^^^^m^^^ Fagot stitching is also ornamen- 

tal stitching. It is used in joining 
pieces of ribbon or cloth. It is done 
by crossing from left to right, like 
feather stitching, except that the nee- 
dle is inserted under the edge of the 

ribbon or fold, and brought out on top, the needle pointing from the center 

instead of pointing toward it.

The blanket stitch is used to pro- 
tect the edge of heavy woolen goods, 
as well as to ornament it. The edge 
worked upon it is held toward you as 
i you work from left to right. Insert 
the needle to the required depth, hold- 
ing the thread down by the left thumb. 
Bring the needle out, allowing it to 
come over the thread, thus forming an edge. Hold thread again with 
the left thumb, and insert the needle about an eighth of an inch from 
the place where it was inserted before, and repeat the stitch. Original- 
ity may be brought into it by varying the lengths of the stitches and their 
arrangement. Heavy silk is best for the blanket stitch.

Draw threads across the material to

down hem even with the last thread

hem, nearest the left end. Hold 
material over forefinger of the left 
hand. Take up four or five threads of material on needle, and draw needle 
through, forming a loop with the thread in it. Draw the loop tight, and, 
holding it firmly with the thumb, insert the needle in the edge of hem, at 
the right of the loop made, and repeat. 

Buttonhole stitch. In this stitch 
an exception is made regarding the 
length of the thread used. The thread 
should be long enough to finish the 
buttonhole without rethreading the 
needle. Cut the buttonhole a little 
larger than the button, because the 
thread used in making it makes it a 
little smaller. Baste around the line 
to be cut for buttonhole, to hold the goods firmly in place. Double the 
material so that the fold will divide the length of it in half, and cut along 
a thread in the material to be sure it will be straight. Overcast the edges 
to prevent them from fraying. Thread the needle with coarse thread. 

Bring the needle through from the wrong side, from the inner end 
of cut, so that the end where the greatest strain falls the work is unbroken. 



HEMSTITCHING 




BUTTONHOLE STITCH 



HOME DRESSMAKING 13 

Fasten the thread by taking- two small stitches at the same place. Never 
use a knot in making a buttonhole. Hold the buttonhole over the first 
finger of your left hand. 

Working on the edge nearest you, bring the needle out about an 
eighth of an inch from the cut edge. Before drawing the needle out, 
draw the thread, doubled as it comes from the eye of the needle, under 
the needle, around to the left. Bring the needle through the loop just 
formed, to draw the thread so that loop forms a stitch at the top of 
cut edge. Make the next stitch very close to the first, inserting the needle 
through the material the same distance from the cut edge as the first 
one was. 

At the end of the lower edge, begin to spread the stitches around the 
corner, and continue along the upper edge the same way. 

Finish the buttonhole by taking two short stitches, one over the other, 
and across these work several stitches close together. 

When practicing these stitches, use coarse material, such as unbleached 
muslin. Colored thread will show up the stitches best. 

LESSON IV 
CUTTING AND SPONGING 

Be careful in cutting material. Most woolen materials have a "nap" 
to the goods, that is, a "pile" of threads pressed smooth. This nap should 
always run downward in garments, except velvet or plush. In these it 
runs upward so that its natural tendency to fall outward will give it a 
richer, deeper color. Panne velvet is the only exception; it should be cut 
with the nap running downward. In cutting several pieces of material to 
be sewed together, care should be taken that the nap runs in the same 
direction in all of them. Otherwise the light will be reflected differently, 
giving it the appearance of different shades of goods. 

One must also be careful in cutting figured or plaid goods. The figure 
should run in the same direction in all pieces, and when joined the pat- 
tern should be matched. Cut the center gore, and before cutting the next 
bring the goods up to the first one and match the pattern in goods. Then 
lay the paper pattern on and cut. 

If two gores form a seam in the back, cut the material doubled, so 
that the patterns in the goods lie exactly together. This often neces- 
sitates the waste of a little material, but there is no other way of matching. 

When cutting the waist, have the stripes or pattern match at the 
shoulder seam.

HOME DRESSMAKING 



The selvedge edges of all wash goods should be cut off before cut- 
ting out the material, for in washing it does not shrink to the same 
extent that the rest of the cloth does, and gives it a puckered appearance. 

It is best to shrink wash goods before making up into garments. 
The color may also be set at this time, by soaking the goods for several 
hours in cold salted water. Then rinse thoroughly in clear water, wring 
out, and press dry. 

It is good to sponge woolen cloth before using, as water often spots 
it afterwards. To sponge, wet a piece of heavy muslin and wring it out. 
Place over cloth to be sponged and press dry. Work slowly. If the 
material is heavy, sponge on both sides. 




LESSON V 

SEAMS 

Seams. A seam is the joining of two pieces of cloth. There are 
four kinds of seams used in dressmaking. They are the plain seam, the 
French seam, the flat-felled seam, and the French-felled seam. 

The plain seam is the mere 
joining of two edges of material so 
that they meet on the wrong side of 
the garment. This style seam is used 
on heavy goods where other kinds 
would be too clumsy. The raw edges 
in this style seam are either bound 
with narrow seam binding or are 
overcast. 

The French seam is made by 
joining the pieces of cloth so that the 
raw edges first come on the -right 
side of the garment. They are then 
trimmed and folded in a crease made 
deep enough to cover the edges. The 
FRENCH SEAM sccoud stitchiug is then made on the 

wrong side of the goods. This seam 
is generally used on wash garments, as wash waists, underskirts, and sum- 
mer dresses.

15 




FLAT- FELLED SEAM 



The flat-felled seam is made*by 
joining the material with the edges 
coming on the wrong side. Then 
trim one edge of seam quite close to 
stitching, and cover it by folding the 
other edge of seam over it, turning 
in raw edge and basting it flat to 
the material. This seam is used on 
undergarments which touch the 
body. 

The French- felled seam is made 
by joining the two edges to finish on 
wrong side. Trim off one edge and 
fold the other edge over it, turning 
in a small hem. Instead of sewing 
it flat to material, double it over the 
trimmed edge, forming a fold, and stitch it at the same place where the first 
stitching was made. This seam is often used in joining embroidery to cloth, 
or in collars and cuffs to make them strong.

LESSON VI 
PLACKETS 




FIG. 2 



FIG. 3 



For petticoat. Cut a strip of material two times the desired length 
of placket, and three and a half inches wide. Sew one long side of this 
to the right side of the edge of opening, on both edges. Then fold the 



16 



HOME DRESSMAKING 



strip of cloth over, so as to cover the raw edges, and, turning in a nar- 
row hem, sew along the same lines as the other edge was sewed. 

When finished, one side of the placket extends straight out from 
material to form the underlap, and the other is turned under even with 
the line of the back seam of the skirt. The set-on strip is entirely hidden 
when the placket is finished. 

For sleeves of tailored waists, and plackets of drawers. Cut placket 
into material the desired depth of placket. Cut a strip of material twice 
the length of placket and one and a half inches wide. Turn in a quarter 
of an inch along both long edges. With the raw edges turned in, stitch the 
strip on the right side of the underneath and on the wrong side of the top 
piece. Finish the placket by setting a strip of the material on top wide 
enough to cover previous stitching. Make the bottom of the piece pointed, 
turning in all raw edges. 

Another underwear placket. If there is no seam, cut opening the 
desired length. Cut a strip of material two times the length of the placket 

and three and a half 
inches wide. Fold the 
two ends together and 
press a crease in the 
center. Then fold it 
in two lengthwise and 
crease ( Fig. 3A) . Open, and cut out one quar- 
ter shown by creases, leaving a small edge to 
fold under. Baste the long edge of this piece 
to both edges of the placket. Turn the wide 

part back, folding in 
the raw edge so that 
it just covers the first 
stitching. Then turn 
back the narrow strip 
left and stitch it down

LESSON VII 

USE OF COMMERCIAL PATTERNS 

Before buying a pattern, have your measurements taken carefully. 
Bust measure should be taken loosely over fullest part of bust, up to a 
raise of about two inches in the center of back. Hip measure should be 
taken nine inches below waist line. Waist measure should be taken snugly 
at normal waist line. These are the only measurements necessary for 
buying a pattern. 

After the pattern is purchased, read the directions carefully before 
laying it on material and cutting. Usually only one half of a pattern is 
given, so that all pieces are to be cut doubled. 

If your figure is out of proportion the pattern may be 
altered to fit it. This should be done before material is cut. 
(Fig. 4). For instance, if you are shorter waisted than the^ 
pattern, do not cut out by pattern and try to remedy the mate- 
rial afterwards. Alter the pattern first. » Know your 
measurement from the center of the collar seam in the back 
to the center of the waist line in the back; also from close 
underarm to waist line and from neck seam in center front 
to waist line there. Compare with the measurements of 
pattern. Take a plait in pattern the necessary width, which 
is the number of inches difiference in your measurements 
and those of the pattern, about two inches above the waist 
line. Even ofif seams of pattern after plaits are laid. 

For a longer waisted person the measurements should 
be taken the same as before, and the pattern cut apart at 
the place where the plait was taken before (Fig. 5). The 
necessary addition in length is made by separating the cut 
pieces of the pattern the required number of inches. 

Alter skirts in the same manner, making necessary 
changes five inches below the hip line. 

Sleeves are altered in two places, a few inches above 
and a few inches below the elbow line (Fig. 3). 

To increase the waist size, cut darts in pattern along 
the waist line and spread open the required amount. To 
decrease the waist size, take small plaits in pattern at this 
place. 

After the pattern has been altered to fit, it is well to 
make a pattern from lining material,to use for further reference.

Millinery in the Home 

LESSON I 
SELECTION OF SHAPE AND MATERIALS 

IN these few lessons on millinery a simple outline is made which should 
be a help to the woman who does her own hat-making at home. 

Originality and personal touches, of course, can be added to the trim- 
ming of every hat to suit the wearer. 

In the selection of a hat, even more so than in that of a dress, the 
personal features and complexion of the wearer should be studied. The 
hat comes nearest the face, and harmony of color must be observed. 
Choose colors which blend with the shade of your hair and eyes. If your 
complexion lacks warmth, here is your opportunity to supply it. 

The appearance of the shape of the face may be greatly affected by 
the shape and style of the hat worn. A becoming hat is one that tends to 
lessen the sharpness of an overly pointed nose and chin ; it has the effect 
of filling out a narrow face and lengthening a too fat one. It emphasizes 
only the best points. 

The girl with a full, round face is usually aided in appearance by a 
wide-brimmed hat. The crown should be high if the wearer is short 
enough to stand an addition in height. Very tall girls look better in a 
flatter crowned hat, for it tends to cut off a few inches from the height in 
appearance. 

Large foreheads should be covered partly by the hair, attractively 
arranged over them, and a hat which fits down considerably low. Three- 
cornered hats, or any styles which have an angle coming out in front, 
should not be worn over thin faces with pointed features. Small, close- 
fitting hats are best suited to such faces. 

The trimming added to a hat may be made to emphasize the general 
effect sought after. Much depends upon the dressing of the hair, as to how 
the hat looks. A little lock on the sides, arranged loosely, is becoming to 
most women. 

Materials. The materials used in millinery are not very expensive; 
it is the making of the hat that increases the cost. By exercising patience 
and using taste, just as beautiful hats may be made at home as can 
be bought. 

For the inexperienced milliner the ready-made frames are the most 
satisfactory. These can be purchased in a variety of shapes for twenty- 

19 



20 MILLINERY IN THE HOME 

five cents. Care should be used in the selection of a shape to choose a 
becoming one, observing the above suggestions. 

If, however, you are unable to obtain the desired shape in a ready- 
made frame, one can be made at practically the same cost. Good buckram 
sells for sixteen to twenty-two cents a yard. (One yard should make two 
hats.) Medium-sized wire comes in rings of various lengths. Enough 
may be bought to wire one hat for five cents. Larger rings, containing 
thirty-six yards, sell for a quarter. Crinoline comes cheaper than buck- 
ram, and a half yard, or even less, is sufficient for one hat. A good pair 
of wire cutters is essential. These are sold at hardware and department 
stores for twenty-five and fifty cents. 

In buying velvet to cover a hat, material is saved by having it cut 
on the bias. 

Strong thread and long, strong needles are a necessity in making hats. 

LESSON II 

MAKING A BUCKRAM FRAME 

The first step necessary in making a buckram frame is to measure 
the head-size of the wearer. Do this by bringing a tape measure around 
the forehead to the back of the head, not too low down. 

A pattern should be made of paper, from which to cut the buckram 
frame. Decide the shape of the hat desired by studying the features of 
the wearer. 

The brim may be irregular in shape, although this style is more diffi- 
cult to make than the perfectly round ones. Cut a circle of paper twice 

the width of the brim desired, to allow for the 
front and back, plus the diameter of the head- 
size (Fig. i). Then fold the paper circle in 
two, and measure on fold the width of brim 
from both ends. The space in between is the 
'""'^" head-size diameter; from it draw circle. If 

^^^' * the hat is not to be perfectly round, trim it 

narrower where desired, while the pattern is still folded. If brim is to fold 
up on one side, the pattern must be made wide enough to allow for this. 
After the pattern has been made, pin it on buckram and cut it out. 
Draw the circle of the head-line, with a pencil, on the buckram ; then draw 
a second circle three- fourths inch inside this, and cut around the smaller 
circle. 





MILLINERY IN THE HOME 21 

From this small circle cut slashes in buckram, an 
inch apart, to the circle of the head-size (Fig. 2). 
This is to turn up into the inside of the crown. 
If the brim is to be perfectly flat, wire the outer 
edge, by cutting a wire a little longer than the dis- 
tance aroiind outer edge of brim. Lap the ends in 
the back and sew to edge, using a blanket stitch. 
Make the stitches close together. 

If brim is to be turned up, or made in mush- 
room shape, crease plaits in edge of buckram ^^^' ^ 
brim. The greater the turn desired, the larger the plaits should be 
made. Open up plaits and slit the edge along one crease of each plait. 
Lap buckram edges slit, over each other, and sew firmly. Then wire 
edge as before. 

Next cut a strip of buckram for the side of crown, as wide as the 
desired height of crown and as long as distance around head-size plus one 
inch for lapping. Lap ends one inch and sew firmly. If the crown is to 
be narrower at the top than at the bottom, as is usually the case, especially 
with high-crowned hats, lap the ends more at the top than at the bottom. 
A dart may also be taken in at the top of the front of the crown. Even 
off the top edge of buckram and wire it. Sew wire to the edges at the 
inside of the top and outside of the bottom, using the blanket stitch again. 

Then sew it to the brim by placing the edges around inside of head- 
size of brim, inside lower edge of crown, and sewing them flat to it firmly. 

For top of crown, cut a piece of crinoline an inch wider than top of 
crown and sew it on over the top, lapping the extra inch down over the 
sides of crown. Sew it flat to sides. The frame is now ready to be 
covered. ' 

LESSON III 
MAKING A WIRE FRAME 

Wire frames are used when the hats are to be covered with lace, 
embroidery, or some thin transparent material. Wire frames may be 
purchased ready made at small cost. 

To make, measure head-size as before. Make a circle of wire this 
size, lapping the wire in back and fastening ends together by wrapping 
securely with finer wire. 

Next cut four wires of equal lengths, as long as twice the brim, plus 
the length of wire required to form a semi-circle over head, down as far 



22 



MILLINERY IN THE HOME 



as head-size wire fits. Join these wires in center so that 
the wires form equal angles. Fasten securely by wrapping 
with finer wire and pinching together with the flat end of 
wire cutters. 

Bend wires to fit head. Then fasten to head-size wire, 
equal distances apart. Bring head-size wire around outside 
of other wires (Fig. 1). 

Make two circles of wires, each smaller than head-size 
one, and fasten them to semi-circle, inside of it. These are 
brace wires to give strength to frame. Next bend ends of 
wires out flat from head-size, turning them up if rolling brim is desired 
(Fig. 2). Measure a wire around the outer edge of these ends and make 
a circle. Bend the ends over the circle and fasten them to it, equal dis- 
tances apart. 




FIG. 1 





FIG. 2 



FIG. 3 



Make one or two smaller circles and fasten them to wires, between 
edge and* head-size, or brim. These are brace wires (Fig. 3). 

A wire frame should be covered with net or chififon before final 



covering is sewed on. 



LESSON IV 
COVERING AND LINING BUCKRAM FRAMES 

Buckram frames may be covered with velvet, silk, straw, or material 
to match a costume. 

The buckram frame should be bound around the outer edge of the 
brim with a strip of crinoline or muslin. The binding should be cut on 
the bias and be about an inch and a half wide. Fold it in two lengthwise, 
and, placing this fold over the edge of the brim, stretch it tight around the 
hat. Mark where the ends meet and join. With a running stitch fasten 
the edges to the brim. This is used to sew the cover of the hat to. 

To cover frame plain. Cut two pieces of material with which hat is 
to be covered, from the pattern by which buckram was cut, leaving a half 
inch turning all around. The center of front and back of pattern should 
be placed on bias of cloth and marked by notches. 

If brim of hat is not flat, a new pattern will have to be made by fit- 



MILLINERY IN THE HOME 



23 




FIG. 1 



ting a piece of paper to the buckram and folding in the necessary plaits. 
Then cut material from this pattern. Often the shape of this patterri 
necessitates the making of a seam in material to insure a fit. 

Cut place for head-size, allowing an inch within head line, which is 
to be cut into as far as head line to turn up against crown. 

Place one piece of material on under side of frame, turning the 
edges over the edge of brim and pinning them to the binding on top. Sew 

material to binding, using overhand stitches 
(Fig. i). Then sew slashed edge of head- 
size up inside the sides of crown, stretch- 
ing the material smooth over the frame. 

Next slip the top piece over the crown, 
and pin or baste it down smooth to top of 
brim. Turn in the half -inch edge all around 
and slip-stitch it to facing. 

Cover top of crown by cutting a circle 
of material a half inch larger than top of 
crown. Fasten edges down over top sides 
of crown, making small plaits in material and sewing them flat to buckram. 
Last, cut a strip of goods on bias of material, just long enough so that 
when the ends are fastened together it will fit snugly around the sides of 
the crown. It should be one inch wider than the height of the crown. 
Sew ends together by running a plain seam on the wrong side of material. 
Press seam open. Turn in bottom edge a half inch and slip it over sides 
of crown. Then turn in top edge, so that it just comes to top of crown. 
The hat is then ready to be lined and trimmed. 

Slip stitching. Knot thread, insert needle inside of fold of cloth, and 
take a long stitch. Directly opposite where needle came out, in fold on 
the other side, insert needle and take a short stitch. Repeat, keepino- all 
long stitches on one side and short ones on the other. After takino- sev- 
eral such stitches loosely, draw them up tight. The stitches should not 
show when drawn tight. 

Lining. Cut lining depth of crown plus two inches wide, and the dis- 
tance around head-size plus one inch long. Run a half-inch hem along 
one edge of material. 

Sew lining to hat, just inside the lower edge of crown, turning in 
raw edges. Start to sew in center back, allowing a quarter of an inch 
at beginning for seam. 

Sew with short, even stitches, taking care that they do not get all 
the way through to the right side and show. 



24 MILLINERY IN THE HOME 

Tape or baby ribbon may be run through the half-inch hem at the 
top and drawn up. A plain piece of the lining may be sewed flat to 
the top of the inside of crown before the ribbon is drawn. This prevents 
any of the buckram frame from showing. 

To cover with silk. When covering a buckram frame with silk, first , 
cover it with a thin layer of sheet wadding, taking the same care to have | 
it neat and smooth that you do the outside covering. This improves the 
fit of the silk and gives the hat a richer appearance. 

Shirred facings. In measuring materials to make shirred facings 
for hats, the length of the goods is the distance around the edge of the 
brim plus an allowance for shirring. This allowance varies with the 
weight of the material. The thinner the goods used, the more of it is 

required. 

For velvet, the length allowed is once and a half the distance around 
the edge of the brim; for silk, twice the circumference of brim is needed; 
for chiffon and Georgette crepe, two and one-half times the distance 
around it; and for maline, five or six times. It is better to have the 
material for shirring cut on the bias of the goods. 

When measuring for shirring threads, mark the lines with pins, or, 
if material is heavy enough, crease the lines into it. Be sure each line 
is straight and that the lines are parallel, that is, equal distances apart 
throughout the entire length. Take short, even stitches. Do not try to 
draw one shirring thread tight until all of the threads are sewed in. 

When a shirred facing is put 

on the brim of a li^it, the under side 

is covered first ( Fig. i ) . The edge 

of the shirring is sewed flat to the 

binding just over the edge of the 

brim on top. Take care to distribute 

J the gathers evenly around the edge. 

Then pull the work down into the 

head-size and run a gathering thread just inside of the crown. Draw the 

gathering in to fit crown and sew firmly to inside of crown. Be careful 

here again that the gathers are evenly distributed. 

Then draw threads tight in shirrings between the head-size and edge 
of brim. Fasten the gathering threads securely before cutting off the 
ends. Sew top on as described for first hat. 

A pretty finishing for the edge of the brim of a hat with a shirred 
facing is a binding of satin. 




MILLINERY IN THE HOME

FIG. 1 



To cover zvith braid. When covering- a hat with braid, start at the 
edge of the brim (Fig. i). The edge should be bound by a strip of the 

braid, sewing it down flat to brim 
on both the top and under side of it. 
Sew the braid on the upper side 
of brim first, starting by laying the 
edge of the braid level with the 
bound edge of brim. Sew the sec- 
ond row of braid lapping the free 
edge of the first row. IJse a fine 
running stitch for sewing on braid. 
Most braid is loosely enough woven 
to allow the outer edge to be stretched as it is sewed on, thus allowing it 
to lie flatly against brim, avoiding wrinkles. 

As the center is reached it may be necessary to run a gathering 
thread through the inner edge of braid to draw it up and make it lay 
flat as it is being sewed on. 

The crown may be covered in two ways. The easiest way is to 
have the braid running in parallel rows across the top, having the ends 

finish down over the sides of the 
crown (Fig. 2). They are later 
covered by the braid which runs 
around the side of crown covering- 
it. The other method is to continue 
sewing the braid on in a circular 
direction until the center is reached. 
The center is finished by twisting 
FIG. 2 the cut end under and sewing it 

down flat. 
Very often a plain piece of silk covers the top of the crown, and the 
sides of crovv^n and brim are covered with braid. 

Lacy braids are sewed over wire frames which have been covered 
by a net or chiffon of the same color. 




LESSON V 
THE TAM O'SHANTER 

The tam is a style hat which is always fashionable and popular for 
the school girl, and is most easily made of all hats. 



26 MILLINERY IN THE HOME 

Cut a strip of buckram one inch longer than head-size, and two and 
a half inches wide. Join ends, lapping them almost an inch. Wire the 
strips on the outside edges, both top and bottom. Cover it with a strip 
of velvet cut on the bias and finished on the inside of band. 

Cut a circle from velvet with a diameter of about twenty-one inches. 
Gather the outer edge of this velvet, and sew securely to band made for 
head-size. Sew it on the outside of this band, near the top edge. The 
outer edge of velvet circle may be box-plaited to band instead of gath- 
ered, if desired. 

Line the hat as described in previous chapter. An inner lining may 
be cut a little smaller than velvet and sewed on under it to give the hat 
more body. 

It is finished by sewing a bias band of velvet around the outside of 
head-size band. The velvet band is cut four inches wide, and the edges 
are hemmed with a catch-stitch. Sew it on, laying it in plaits running 
around band. The joining of the ends may be finished by a flat jet orna- 
ment, or a flat bow made from velvet. 

A tassel may be fastened to the center of the top of the velvet, under 
a flat velvet-covered button. 

All seams should come in center of back. 



LESSON VI 
TRIMMING THE HAT 

Simplicity in trimming is the keynote of fashion. It is the general 
tendency of beginners to overtrim a hat. There can be no set rules 
as regards trimming, for not only do the style of ornaments change every 
year, but every woman requires a different type of trimming. 

Wings, breast, and feathers of all kinds, if fastened to the hat at 
proper angles, are good. In sewing these on, use very strong thread, sew 
securely, but have the stitches hidden as much as possible. 

Artificial flozvers when used with taste can add greatly to the appear- 
ance of the hat. Small, simple flowers of delicate shades are best for 
children's bonnets and hats. Never overload a hat with them. One or 
two larger flowers is usually sufficient, in combination with foliage and

Ribbon is the most common trimming used, and if tastily arranged 
can give a hat a rich appearance. Grosgrain ribbon an inch or two wide,

or jet trimming, is good. Bows, loops, rosettes and flowers may all be 
made of ribbon for hat trimming. 

Many beautiful artificial flowers are easily made from ribbon to be 
worn on the dress, coat or mufif, as well as for hat trimming. These 
can be made at home at small expense. We will give directions here for 
making roses and violets, and will be pleased to send directions for other 
flowers to anyone who will send in requesting them. 

The rose may be made in different colors, yellow, American Beauty 
shade, old rose, and pink. It is a good plan to buy ribbon of two har- 
monizing shades of the same color. Make the center of the rose and the 
first few petals of the darker shade, and fasten the lighter 
petals at the outside. 

For ribbon three inches wide, one and one-half yards 
are required in length. 

Petals are cut from ribbon folded in two (Fig. 1). 
Cut two petals one and three-fourths inches. 
Cut two petals two inches. 
Cut three petals two and one-half inches. 
Cut three petals three inches. 
With each petal folded in two, run a gathering thread through the 
raw edges, then overcast them. 

Turn the corners of the first two petals down square, and fasten 
them down from underneath, through one thick- 
ness of ribbon, so stitches will not show (Fig. 2). 
Roll down the corners of the other petals 
(Fig. 3)- 

Cut a piece of medium heavy wire for stem. 
Bend one end back, and twist it around stem to 
about an inch from end. 

Wrap this with a piece of the darker shade 
of ribbon, to cover the bended end bi wire. This 
forms the center of rose. Sew the raw edges 
firmly to wire (Fig. 4). 

Then fold gathered ends of first petal and 
fasten to stem, so that the petal just folds over 
the center. Without breaking thread, lap the next 
one over the first directly opposite it. The third one is 
placed to fold over one side of these, and the fourth 
over the other side. The rest of the petals are then fastened to the stem 
very securely, each one lapping a little over the edge of the previous one.

When all of the petals are 
firmly sewed on, slip the wire stem 
through a calyx, and push it up to 
the rose. Then slip it through a 
seed cup and slide it close to the 
calyx. 

The stem may be bought to 
cover the wire already made, and 
little holes may be pierced in it to 
hold the foliage. However, the 
stem may be made to look just as 
well by wrapping it with green baby 
ribbon, wrapping the leaf stems in 
as you work. 

Rose foliage, calyxes, seed 
cups, daisy and violet centers can 
be purchased in the fancy goods department of large stores. 

To make violets. Buy a bolt of ten yards of ribbon, one-half inch 
wide, violet shade, a spool of green covered wire for violet stems (ten 
cents a spool) and a bunch of violet centers (five cents a bunch). Cut 
wire into five or six inch lengths. Fasten three or four violet centers to 

one end of each by wrapping the wire 
around them and pinching them tight 
with the flat end of wire cutters (Fig. i). 
Tie knots in the ribbon, one inch 
apart, twisting the satin side up always. 
Cut these knots apart in center of ribbon 
between them (Fig. 2). Fold ends to- 
gether so that the knot is on top, and the 
satin side of the ribbon shows. Holding 
the ends together, gather five of them on 
a thread and draw them up tight (Fig. 3). 
Draw the green stem through the center 
of this ribbon so that the yellow centers just peek through. Sew the rib- 
bon petals securely to wire. 

After the ribbon has all been made up into violets, they may be 
finished by scattering a fernlike foliage among them and fastening the 
stems all together, or by putting the violets all in one mass and placing 
green violet leaves around the outside. 

Wrap the stems in silver or violet colored tinfoil.

Well-Balanced Meal 

LESSON I 
COMPOSITION OF THE BODY 

THE problem of feeding the family today is no longer merely, "What 
shall I plan for dinner today that will be a change?" If this were 
the only point to be considered it would be no problem at all, because 
of the many menus published in the newspapers. The problem is, "What 
shall I feed my family that will supply in proper proportions the nourish- 
ment needed?" In other words, we must study the composition of the 
body to learn how the food that we take into it is utilized, and find the 
proportions in which the various food elements are needed. 

If we arrange menus so that the waste of food in the body is as 
little as possible, not giving an overabundance of one class of food and 
stinting on another, the cost of the meal should be perceptibly diminished. 

In our course of lessons we will undertake the study of certain topics 
that will teach us to prepare a palatable meal at minimum cost, one 
which will supply the body with just what it needs. 

Food when taken into the body has certain functions to perform. It 
builds bone and flesh, and supplies heat and energy to the body. Not all 
foods perform all of these functions, but all foods do at least one or 
more of them. Therefore in a well-balanced meal we must have a variety 
of foods that will, when combined, serve all of these purposes. 

The body is composed of millions of tiny cells; each collection of 
these cells carry on a certain work in the body, and as a collection they 
form themselves into tissues of the body. As we work or play, these 
tissues are worn out, cell by cell, and new ones must be built to take 
their places. These are built from the food which we eat. In addition 
to replacing worn-out cells, and the forming of other new ones, the body 
must have heat and energy. The heat is brought about by the burning 
of certain foods in the body. Just as coal or wood, when burned in a 
stove, gives out heat, so the food we eat, when joined with oxygen in 
the body, burns and furnishes heat. 

The oxygen, with which the food unites, enters the body largely 
through the air breathed into the lungs. 

A brief outline of how the food is changed into flesh and bone will 
be helpful. 

The food, when taken into the mouth, undergoes two changes. One 
is a physical change. This is brought about through the mastication of 

28 A 



28 B WELL-BALANCED MEAL 

the food in the mouth, and as it passes on to the stomach, a churning 
process there. The last physical action brought to bear on it is the process 
which takes place in the intestines, called peristalsis. This is the con- 
traction of the intestinal walls, one ring at a time, pushing the food 
continually forward. The food is thus broken up into fine particles, so 
that it may be easily acted upon. 

The other change is a chemical one. When we begin to chew food, 
saliva is poured into the mouth from the glands of the cheek. This saliva 
contains an element, in solution, called an enzyme, which mixes with the 
food and divides the starchy food present into very fine particles — too 
small to be detected by the eye. As the food passes on to the stomach, 
another fluid is mixed with it here — the gastric juice. It also has enzymes 
in it which act upon the food, dividing the particles into still finer pieces. 
Here the action which was started on starchy foods in the mouth is con- 
tinued, and different foods are started to be broken up. As they leave 
the stomach and enter the intestines, still another fluid is mixed with 
them, and the food particles which have not been made small enough in 
the mouth or stomach have a last chance here. Not until the food reaches 
the intestines are the fat particles acted upon. 

The walls of the intestines are porous, that is, they contain very 
tiny passages through which the food, when broken into small enough 
particles may pass into the blood. The blood in its circulation carries 
the food through the body to the cells which need it, building it up again 
into tissue form. If there is an excess of starchy food present it is taken 
out by the liver as the blood passes through it, and stored for future 
use. An excess of starchy foods may also be changed to fat and stored 
under the skin. 

The lungs are also porous enough to allow the oxygen from the air 
we breathe to pass into the blood, thus purifying it, and when uniting 
with the carbon element of the food causing heat to be formed. 

LESSON II 

THE FIVE FOOD PRINCIPLES 

In the previous lesson we stated that not all foods performed the 
same function in the body. Foods are divided into five classes for the 
purpose of studying them. These are proteids, or flesh-building foods; 
carbohydrates, that is, starchy and sugar foods, which furnish heat and 
energy; fats, which do the same; mineral matter, or bone building and 
fluid regulating food ; and water, which regulates the general working of 
the machinery of the body. 



WELL-BALANCED MEAL 28 C 

We will take them up separately, treating them as to best method 
of preparation, food value of each, and examples of food in which each 
is found in abundance. 

Proteid. "A diet should contain proteid enough to build and repair 
the tissues of the body." More proteid is needed for growing children 
than for the full-grown person, because in addition to the worn-down 
cells which have to be built up, still other new ones must be formed. 

The hard laboring man needs from two to three times the amount 
necessary for the one whose occupation is sedentary. Meat, cheese, milk, 
eggs, and fish should be found in quantities in the diet of the former, 
while that of the latter should consist largely of fresh vegetables, such 
as turnips, beets, onions, squash, spinach, celery, lettuce, green corn, cauli- 
flower, and cabbage. 

Foods containing proteid in abundance do not require long cooking. 
The proteid often becomes coagulated and hardened so that it is very 
hard to digest, containing little or no food value when heated above 
boiling point. 

Foods which are richest in proteid are: eggs, cheese, milk, beans, 
lentils, peas, beef, veal, codfish, herring, mackerel, oysters, walnuts, and 
peanuts. 

An illustrative table shows the proportion of protein and other food 
elements found in some of the above mentioned. 

Carbo- Mineral 

Protein hydrates Fat Matter Water 

Herring 36.4 .. 15.8 13.2 34.6 

Eggs 14.5 •• 10.5 i.o 74.0 

Cream cheese 25.9 2.4 33.7 3.8 34.2 

Carbohydrates. We stated above that fats and carbohydrates, that 
is, starches and sugars, both were of value to the body for supplying 
heat and energy. This is true, but fats could not be eaten to perform this 
work alone, because of their difficulty of being digested. They are not 
acted upon in the body until they reach the intestines. Still, some fats 
are needed, because if carbohydrates alone were depended upon to fur- 
nish the body heat, the amount that would necessarily need to be eaten 
would prove too bulky for the digestive organs to handle. 

An overabundance of carbohydrates may be changed to fat and stored 
in the body, but more may be eaten than the body can take care of, and 
then what excess is not thrown off by the excretive organs lodges itself 



28 D WELL-BALANCED MEAL 

in crystalline form along the mucous surface of the arteries. This causes 
stiffness of the joints, rheumatism, lumbago, diabetes, and gout. 

Small amounts of carbohydrates are necessary for middle-aged and 
old people. 

Carbohydrates require long cooking, for heat has the effect of break- 
ing starch particles into sugar particles, which are finer, more soluble, 
and therefore more easily and completely digested. 

Foods abundant in carbohydrates are: potatoes, sugar, molasses, 
candy, honey, cereals, potatoes, bread, and macaroni. 

The proportion of the food principles found in some of them are : 

Carbo- Mineral

Sugar loo.o 

Candy 96.5 •• •• 0-5 3-0 

Honey 81.2 0.4 .^ 0.2 18.2 

Rice 77.0 8.0 2.0 i.o 12.0 

Bread 53-1 9-2 1.3 i-i 35-3 

Potato 18.0 2.2 1.0 1.4 78.3 

Fats. Fats should not be eaten in the quantity that other foods are. 
Six or seven ounces a day is sufficient for a normal person. More than 
that would be hard to digest. It is best for a person when taken in 
emulsified form, that is, when made into gravies, salad dressings, and 
sauces. Bacon, which is 67 per cent fat, is digested quite easily. 

Fat melts at a very low temperature, and loses its food value when 
heated to the stage where it smokes or burns. 

Foods rich in fats are: olive oil, bacon, lard, butter, suet, nuts, fish, 
eggs, cream, and cheese.

Mineral matter. This is as necessary to health as are the above men- 
tioned foods. It is found in all digestive fluids, making it necessary for 
digestion. No tissue can be built without it. In cooking foods contain- 
ing mineral substances, care should be taken that they do not lose their 
food value in cooking, for most of them are soluble in water. 



WELL-BALANCED MEAL 28 E 

Green vegetables, roots and tubers, raisins, eggs, oranges, and most 
cereals are rich in mineral matter, and most of them contain salt 
in solution. 

Water. The body is composed of nearly 60 per cent water. It is 
absolutely essential to life. Among its uses in the body are: reducing 
food to liquid condition so that it may be more readily digested; diluting 
the blood and helping to carry the food supply to parts where it is 
needed; and carrying off the waste. It also helps to regulate the 
body temperature and keep the alimentary canal clear. Too much water 
cannot be taken into the system. 

Outside of the water we drink, plain and in beverages, all of our 
food contains some water. Whole milk is 87 per cent water, eggs are 
74 per cent, celery is 95 per cent, potato 78 per cent, and string beans 89 
per cent water. 

Another element which plays quite a prominent part in our eating, 
but which is not a food proper (for it neither supplies heat and energy 
nor builds tissue), is cellulose. It is the cell walls of cereals, and 
although it does not digest at all, it stimulates the muscles of the stomach 
and intestines into action, aiding digestion. This is the reason that bran 
bread is preferable to white bread. It is rich in ballast. 

From this discussion we can see that a well-balanced meal requires 
a variety of food. Digestion is more complete when the diet is mixed, 
for if carbohydrates alone were eaten, they would leave the stomach so 
quickly that one would feel hungry too soon, although the body might be 
kept warm enough from them. If the meal consisted only of fat, the 
digestion would be so slow that a person would not have an appetite for the 
next meal, and therefore would not eat enough to be nourished. Protein 
alone would not be sufficient, for there would be no heat and energy. 

For the meal to be well balanced there must be food for fuel, a 
good percentage of proteid, ash, and water, and the whole selected and 
combined to tempt and nourish the ones for whom it was prepared. 

LESSON III 
PLANNING THE MEALS 

There are many considerations to be kept in mind when planning a 
meal. It should be attractive in appearance to stimulate the appetite; it 
should be well balanced, containing a variety of appetizingly made dishes ; 
and it should be of moderate cost. 

To have regular meals is important. The digestive organs can take 



28 F WELL-BALANCED MEAL 

care of a limited amount of food and do it well. They can best work 
when trained to take care of practically the same amount each day, at 
regular intervals. To eat between meals is doing the digestive system 
a great harm. 

Plan to have the meal served when the members of the family are 
not overly exhausted. To get proper nourishment from a meal, a person 
should be in a pleasant, quiet state of mind. Worry, extreme exhaustion, 
irritableness, excitement, and anger, all retard the flow of the digestive 
fluids and prevent normal digestion. 

The planning of menus should not be difficult. We naturally com- 
bine foods containing the various elements. For instance, we put butter 
on bread because it improves the taste of it, at the same time it makes 
a more nearly perfect food. Bread contains 53 per cent carbohydrate, 
9 per cent protein, 35 per cent water, i per cent ash, and i per cent fat. 
So by adding butter to the bread we increase the fat and mineral value of 
it. The same principle holds true in adding cheese to macaroni. 

Take care that you do not have too many foods which are similar 
in color and flavor. It is better not to have two starchy vegetables, such 
as potatoes and rice, at one meal. Rather substitute a green vegetable 
for one of them. 

Do not consider the menu of one meal alone, but figure out menus 
for two or three days at a time, in order to utilize all left-overs, and 
to supply a variety from one meal to the next. 

The general outline for breakfasts should be: 

(i) Simple Breakfast, (2) Moderate Breakfast, (3) Elaborate Breakfast 



Fruit 


Fruit

Cereal 


Cereal

Toast 


One hot dish 


Meat or Eggs

Beverage

Each dish may be varied every day; for instance, oranges, grape- 
fruit, berries in season, stewed fruits, sliced bananas, and peaches may 
succeed each other on following mornings to fill the fruit supply. 

Toast, baking powder biscuits, muffins, and pop-overs may be inter- 
changed. 

The beverage may be varied if so desired — coffee, tea, cocoa, postum 
cereal, or milk. Ham, sausage, steak, and bacon are popular breakfast 
meats. Eggs may be served to take their place or combined with them. 



WELL-BALANCED MEAL 28 G 

For the elaborate breakfast, corn fritters, fried potatoes, fried mush, 
or oatmeal will prove a variety. 

As to cereals, there are countless numbers and prepared and 
uncooked ones on the market. A coarse-grained cereal is best. 
Wheatena, or bran cooked in a cereal, will aid in the digestion of 
the cereal. 

A word here on the cooking of cereals may be said. Breakfast 
cereals, such as oatmeal, flaked wheat, etc., require long cooking. They 
are composed of cells enclosed in cell walls which can only be broken 
down by extreme heat. The food inside the cell walls is not reached 
until the walls themselves are made penetrable. It is a good plan to 
steam cereals, for steam penetrates where water cannot. When taking 
into consideration the amount of food value obtained in return for the 
money expended, it is found that cereals are the cheapest food on the 
m.arket and should be used more freely than they are at present. 

For further information on Cereals see page 436. The luncheon, 
like the breakfast, may be elaborate or simple, as desired. Three out- 
lines are given below: 

One hot dish Soup One or two hot dishes 

Bread and Butter One other hot dish Bread and Butter 

Dessert Bread and Butter Salad 

Beverage Dessert Dessert 

Beverage Beverage 

A simple luncheon menu is: 

Creamed Beef on Toast 

Rye and White Bread Butter 

Orange Tapioca 

Tea 

There is a wide variety allowed from day to day in the luncheon : 

The dinner is the most elaborate meal. At dinner the meal may be 
started with soup, although for a simple home dinner this is not neces- 
sary. The general order for a dinner is, (i) Soup, (2) Two or three 
hot dishes, one meat and two vegetables, (3) Relish, either jelly or pickles, 
or both, (4) Salad, (5) Dessert, and (6) Beverage. The beverage may 
be served with the meal or at the end of it, as desired. 

When serving a meal where the meat is very rich, endeavor to 
serve a tart relish; apple sauce is good with pork, and cranberries 
with fowl. 



Dinner Giving 

LESSON I 

DINNER GIVING has become an art. It requires tact to select 
a group of guests who will be congenial; to so place them at the 
table that those having interests in common are seated next to 
each other. So important has the giving of dinners become to us as a 
nation that very often our statesmen bring about settlements of affairs 
pleasantly while at a small dinner party. 

For a formal dinner, invitations are sent out ten days in advance. 
The reason for this is to give the hostess plenty of time to fill the 
vacancy made by any guests who decline. The hostess may write the 
invitation herself on note paper, or may have cards engraved announc- 
ing the meal. Whichever form she uses, the wording of the invitation is 
always the same : 

Mr. and Mrs. Frederick Lane 

request the pleasure of 

Mr. and Mrs. George Lee's 

company at dinner 

on June 22, Thursday evening, 

at eight o'clock. 

739 West End Ave. 

If the dinner is to be given in honor of a guest, the hostess may 
write, "To meet Mr. and Mrs. Montieth." 

The dinner card is always addressed to both husband and wife, if 
married persons are invited. When other members of the same family 
are invited, separate invitations are sent to each one. 

For small dinners, friendly notes are written to invite the guests. 
For example: 

My dear Mrs. Craig: 

Will you and Mr. Craig give us the pleasure 
of your company at dinner on Wednesday, the 
twelfth, at seven o'clock? 

Very sincerely yours, 

Marjory Grey. 

Prompt answers, written within one day, should be sent. Make the 
reply definite; you will be glad to accept Mrs. Lane's kind invitation, or 
you regret that illness in the family prevents your acceptance of Mrs. 

28 H 



DINNER GIVING 281 

Lane's kind invitation. Never say you will be glad to accept the invi- 
tation providing something does not prevent. If the invitation is formal, 
the answer should be the same, as : 

24 Fairview Ave. 

June 14, 19. . 

Mr. and Mrs. George Lee 

accept with pleasure 

Mrs. James Briggs' 

invitation to dinner on 

Thursday evening, June 22, 

at eight o'clock. 

A note is correct form to use in answering a note invitation to an 
informal dinner: 

14 Courtland Place 
April 24, 19. . 

Dear Mrs. Grey: 

Mr. Craig and I will be most happy to dine 
with you on Wednesday, the twelfth, at seven 
o'clock. Sincerely yours, 

Marion Craig. 

If at the eleventh hour a guest is prevented from being present, 
and another is asked to fill the vacancy, be perfectly frank with the late 
invitation. Do not send a note to him such as the other guests received, 
but rather write a cordial note, explaining, the circumstances, as the 
following : 

2300 Ridge Ave. 
Feb. 7, 19. . 
Dear Mr. Fenwick: 

May I impose upon your agreeable disposi- 
tion, and ask you to help me out at a dinner party, 
on Thursday, the tenth? One of my guests met 
with an accident on the ice last night, and will not 
be able to be present. We are dining at seven 
o'clock. My husband and I will consider ourselves 
under pleasant obligations to you for the pleasure 
of your presence as well as the favor you will be 
doing us. Sincerely yours, 

Marian Crosby. 



28 J DINNER GIVING 

Such invitations should be answered at once in the same friendly 
terms that the invitation was worded. 

14 Parkway Drive 
Feb. 8, 19. . 
Dear Mrs. Crosby: 

It will afford me great pleasure to dine with 
you, and at the same time serve you. I shall be 
with you on Thursday at seven o'clock, and hope 
to be able to assure you that the pleasure of the 
situation is all mine. 

Very sincerely yours, 

Thomas B. Fenwick. 

Still less formal invitations may be given verbally over the telephone. 

In preparing the house for a dinner party, first have it spotlessly 
clean, well aired, and simply decorated. Vases of flowers, set around on 
various stands, and shaded lamps serve the purpose of decoration. See 
to it that the comforts of the guests are closely attended. Provide a 
dressing room for ladies where their wraps may be removed. Gentle- 
men lay aside their coats, hats, and gloves in the hall. 

The dining room, of course, requires the most attention. The tem- 
perature of this room should be kept at about 75 degrees. Ventilation 
is important; be sure that no odors from the kitchen be allowed to drift 
into the dining room. 

The light in the room should be centered upon the table, so that 
every part of the cloth is radiant. If possible, have it so shaded that the 
eyes of the persons seated around the table are protected. Shaded can- 
dles serve the purpose of table decorations and throw a soft light on 
the table. 

Setting the table. Before the cloth is spread, a thickness of felt 
or flannel should be placed over the table. Then a large white pure 
linen cloth should be laid, having the center crease of the cloth run- 
ning straight down the middle of the table. The cloth should be long 
enough so that the four corners almost touch the floor. 

A flat' centerpiece of flowers is the chief ornament of every table. 
This may be in a flat basket or a large flat cut glass bowl filled with 
flowers. Have harmony of color in table decorations ; for instance, pink 
sweet peas, pink roses, or pink carnations should be used with pink lamp 
shades. Yellow daffodils, yellow roses, or yellow jonquils look well when 
used on a table with yellow shaded lights. 



DINNER GIVING 28 K 

The menu. The number of courses served depends upon the num- 
ber of guests to be present, usually. If eight persons are present, seven 
or eight courses are served; for a banquet fourteen courses may be 
served. For six, a five or six course dinner is sufficient. 

For an eight course dinner the order of serving is: 



(I) 


Grape fruit or oysters 


(2) 


Clear soup 


(3) 


Fish 


(4)

LESSON II 



HINTS ON THE PREPARATION AND SERVING OF A MEAL 

There are three recognized forms of service, the English, the Rus- 
sian, and the Compromise. 

The English service is the most simple form and is the most prac- 
tical where only one servant is employed. All of the food belonging to 
one course is placed on the table before the host, or hostess, and served 
by him or her. 

The Russian service is extremely formal, and is used entirely for 
formal dinners and luncheons. A number of competent servants are nec- 
essary to conduct it well. The individual plates may be filled with food 
in the kitchen and brought in and placed before each person. Or the 
plates may be placed empty for each course, and all of the food, attrac- 
tively arranged on suitable dishes, passed by servants, allowing each per- 
son to help himself. In this service there should be a servant to every 
two or three persons. 

The Compromise, as its name suggests, is a mixture of the two above 
mentioned. In it some courses may be served English, some Russian, and 
some combine the two. For example, the soup and dessert may be served 
on individual dishes, filled before reaching the table (Russian) ; the meat 
may be carved at the table by the host, and the vegetables passed by the 
waitress (combining the Russian and English), and the salad may be 
placed before the hostess and served by her (English). 



28 L DINNER GIVING 

A careful observance of each person's needs should be attended to 
by the waitress. The water glasses, bread and butter plates should be 
kept supplied without special attention being drawn to them. All serving 
dishes necessary to the meal should be placed on the serving table or in 
the pantry, and also an array of all of the silverware used, so that in 
case a piece should be accidentally dropped at the table it can be quickly 
replaced without attracting attention. 

A clean soft napkin should be at hand, to be used by the waitress 
to absorb any upset liquid. The spot should then be covered with a clean 
doily or napkin. 

All hot dishes should be hot, and cold dishes chilled before coming 
to the table. Salads, cold meats, and cold desserts should be kept in the 
ice box until just before serving them. Hot foods should be served on 
hot dishes, and kept in a warming oven or on the back of a warm stove 
until served. 

It is the duty of the hostess to taste every food before it comes to 
the table, in order to know that it is seasoned properly, and is neither 
over nor under done. 

Make every dish attractive in appearance. The garnishing should 
be simple and, whenever possible, something that may be eaten. For 
example, lettuce, parsley, sliced eggs on spinach or other greens, sliced 
lemon, radishes cut in rose shape, curled celery, watercress, red and green 
peppers, and any number of vegetables served uncooked, such as tomatoes. 

All plates should be placed before each person from the right, by the 
right hand of the maid, and removed from the left. When presenting a 
dish of food, the waitress should have a squarely folded napkin on the 
palm of the left hand under the dish. Serve it to the left of the person, 
low and close enough so that he can conveniently help himself with his 
right hand. 

In clearing the table for the succeeding course, remove all dishes 
containing food; taking the platter or largest dish first, and the soiled 
plates and silver next, leaving the clean silver and china which were not 
used until last. Leave the bread and butter plates on the table until after 
the salad course. Salted nuts, water and wine glasses remain upon the 
table throughout the meal. In clearing for dessert, remove everything 
but table decorations from the table. It is not necessary to crumb the table 
except at clearing for dessert. Then the crumbs should be removed by 
using a small napkin and a pretty plate, upon which a flower is placed 
for decoration. 

Women should be served first, starting with the guest of honor.

The amount of table space allotted each person is called a "cover." 
This cover should be twenty-two inches wide and eighteen inches deep. 
Within it is placed everything to be used by the person for the meal. The 
soup dish is set in the center of the cover one inch from the edge of the 
table. To the left of this are the forks, and to the left of them the nap- 
kin. At the right of the service plate are the knife and spoons, arranged 
in the order in which they are to be used, those to be needed first being 
placed farthest from the plate. All of these should be placed an inch 
away from the table edge. The sharp edge of the knife is turned toward 
the plate. Water and wine glasses are at the right of the plate, just at 
the end of the knife. Bread and butter plates at the end of the fork on 
the left side, and the nut cups at the top of the plate in the center. The 
bread and butter knife is laid across the bread and butter plate, sharp 
edge in. 

Cheerful, interesting conversation at a dinner is expected from the 
guests as well as the host and hostess, to insure a successful dinner.

In the homes where they are no servants, the hostess should arrange 
every course for the meal so that it may be served in shortest possible 
time. 

Never attempt to entertain more guests than you can conveniently 
care for, and do not attempt a too elaborate style of service. 

The hostess should sit at the end of the table nearest the kitchen 
door. It is better to use the English style service. Place everything for 



28 N DINNER GIVING 

the first course on the table before the host, and let him serve. The food 
for the second course should be in readiness in the warming oven, to be 
brought in and placed before the host as soon as the dishes are cleared 
from the first course. 

Be sure that the table is set completely before sitting down. Fill the 
water glasses, bread and butter plates between each two courses. Then 
it should not be necessary for the hostess to leave the table until the course 
is finished, except in case of accident. 



LESSON III 
SOME SIMPLE RULES IN ETIQUETTE 

The first duty of the guest is to arrive at the hostess' door at the time 
mentioned in the invitation. Do not be more than ten minutes earlier or 
later than the hour named. If unavoidably detained, the guest should 
offer a brief, sincere apology to the hostess. 

Upon reaching the dining room table, the gentlemen wait until the 
hostess is seated. Sit about eight inches from table, in an erect position. 
Do not lounge back in your chair nor rest your elbows upon the table. 
When not employed in carrying food to your mouth, or preparing it on 
your plate, the hands should be folded in the lap. Never handle the 
table furnishings. It is the mark of a well-bred person to be at ease 
in a reposeful attitude at the table. 

The napkin should be unfolded until it lays across the lap doubled. 
Do not spread it out full, nor tuck it in the waistcoat. Use a corner of 
the napkin frequently to wipe the lips clean. Since you are only the guest 
of one meal, the napkin will not be used again, and therefore should not 
be folded. At the end of the meal place it on the table beside the plate, 
unfolded. 

The knife is used in the right hand always, for the purpose of cutting 
alone. Never convey food to the mouth with a knife. 

The fork is held in the right hand when the cutting is finished. Do 
not mash food on plate with fork. When passing the plate back for a 
second helping, leave the knife and fork lay across the side of the plate, 
with their handles resting on its edge. 

Remove the spoon from the cup and leave it rest in saucer while 
drinking from cup. 



DINNER GIVING 28 

When taking soup into a spoon, dip it away from you. Drink from 
the side of a spoon, never the end of it. Do not use a spoon for con- 
veying food to the mouth when a fork may be substituted. 

When fingerbowls are used they may be placed before each guest 
at the end of the meal only, or they may be used at the end of every 
two or three courses. Flat bowls, half filled with delicately scented tepid 
water, in which a flower or a few petals are placed, are set upon a plate, 
which have been covered with small white doilies. 

Dip the fingers of one hand at a time into the water, and gently free 
them from stickiness by rubbing them together. Dry the fingers on the 
napkin in your lap. 

To obtain the most benefit from your food, eat slowly, chewing each 
mouthful carefully. Keep the lips closed while masticating food. Take 
small enough bites of food that you will be able to talk if called upon. Do 
not talk with a mouthful of food, and never smack the lips together when 
chewing. 

To let a piece of silverware clash with the glasses or chinaware is 
a mark of poor breeding. Handle all dishes noiselessly. 

When eating bread, do not butter a whole slice and bite pieces out of 
it. Break it as needed, one mouthful at a time, and spread butter upon it, 
each piece separately. 

Pickles, olives, cheese, celery, salted nuts, and bonbons, as well as 
many varieties of raw fruit, are eaten with the fingers. A whole olive 
should never be put into the mouth at once. Eat around the seed, hold- 
ing it in the hand. 

The host should never urge any article of food upon a guest when 
the guest does not care for it. 

When asked to express a preference in regard to what pieces of fowl 
are desired, do so without hesitation. Never leave the decision with 
the carver. 

Do not hesitate to take the last piece from a dish. 

When drinking, look into the cup or glass from which you are drink- 
ing, and not over the edge of it. 

Do not comment upon the food or the table decorations. After the 
meal, it is sufficient to remark to the hostess that everything was deli- 
ciously appetizing, or that her taste in table decorations is perfect. 

Never fail to bid the hostess adieu, thanking her for the hospitality 
enjoyed. A few words such as : "I am indebted to you for a most enjoy- 
able evening, Mrs. Smith ; I am sorry it has ended so soon," is sufficient.

LESSON IV 
EAT AND GROW THIN 

From our study in the lesson on a well-balanced meal, we should be 
able to draw conclusions as to what foods to eat in order to build up 
flesh and what ones to leave alone in order to reduce. 

Starchy foods and fats when eaten in proper proportions will make 
fat on the body. Therefore, if you are trying to reduce, leave these 
foods alone. 

Never e«it cheese, milk, cream, olive oil, ham, bacon, corn, rice, wheat, 
oats, white bread, macaroni, sugar, candy, potatoes, figs, bananas, grapes, 
nuts, or raisins. Leave alcoholic beverages alone, especially beer and ale. 
Do not drink water with your meals, but wait until an hour or so after- 
ward. Then drink mineral water if possible. 

These foods eliminate starch, sugar, and fat from your diet — noth- 
ing else. There is still a big variety of foods which may be eaten. 

Fruit, except the two above mentioned, all meat, except pork, game, 
and sea food, will not add fat to the body. Green vegetables may be 
eaten in abundance. String beans, spinach, cauliflower, beets, squash, 
cabbage, artichokes, parsnips, onions, and asparagus will not hurt you. 
Salads minus oil dressings, made from meat jellies, tomatoes, cucumbers, 
peppers, olives, and celery, are good. 

Three menus which are nourishing will serve as examples. More can 
easily be arranged without overstepping the boundary line.

least once a day.

LESSON V 
EAT AND GROW FAT 

The directions for putting on flesh are just the opposite those given 
to grow thin. Eat starchy and fat foods. Cereals are especially good 
because they contain so much carbohydrates in themselves; and when 
eaten with cream and sugar, more fat and carbohydrates are added. 

Eat salads containing fat in the dressing, for fat in this form, as in 
gravies, is emulsified, and therefore very easily digested. 

Drink much milk and cream ; put olive oil on everything you can to 
be eaten. 

Always be in a calm, pleasant state of mind before eating. Sleep a 
great deal, avoid worrying, and eat large quantities of food. 

Avoid acid foods, such as pickles and tomatoes.

LESSON I 
MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

THERE are two important reasons why we should learn to make 
appetizing dishes to take the place of meat in our diet. The first 
one is the vegetarian reason, which you will find discussed on pages 
408-409. The other is the economical reason. Meat is beyond the cost 
which many can afford. If, then, we can eat other foods which will 
supply us with the same amount of nourishment that meat does, and which 
we can obtain at a considerably lower cost, it is our duty to do so. 

We eat meat to build flesh; therefore we must supply foods to take 
its place which will do the same. 

Nuts, cereals, cheese, eggs, and dried beans are foods which contain 
practically every element present in meat, and, if prepared in proper 
proportions, form an appetizing diet at a low cost. 

Macaroni and spaghetti may be brought to take an important place in 
the meatless cookery. Menus for some well-balanced meatless meals are

Some recipes which are rich in elements that are used to take the place 
of meat are given here. 

Spaghetti au Gratin 

Break up four ounces of spaghetti and boil until tender in water to 
which a teaspoon of salt has been added and a half tablespoon of butter. 
Drain. Melt two tablespoons of butter, add one tablespoon of flour, one 
cupful of milk, one teaspoonful of mustard, salt and pepper. Stir until it 
boils, simmer for a few minutes, add spaghetti and two tablespoonfuls of 
grated cheese. Turn into buttered dish, sprinkle cheese over top, and 
bake ten minutes. Garnish with parsley. 

Macaroni with Oysters 

Put half a pound of macaroni into plenty of boiling salted water, 
add one tablespoon of butter, and cook until tender. Drain it well. Put 
a layer in a buttered baking dish, and then a layer of oysters. Dot v/ith 
small pieces of butter and season with salt, pepper, and paprika; alter- 
nate layers of macaroni and oysters, and finish with a layer of macaroni 
sprinkled thickly with grated cheese. Bake in a moderate oven for twenty 
minutes. Serve hot.

LESSON II 
PICNIC COOKING 

No recreation is quite as popular these days, when the automobile 
brings the country so close to the town and city, as to prepare part of a 
lunch at home, pack some provisions to be cooked later, and take a trip 
out to the country for a few days' camping, or even for one supper. 

There is a knack in getting an outfit ready, taking only necessary 
articles which have the least weight and bulk. Recipes given in ordinary 
cook books are of little value, for they are always calling for things you 
could not take. 

Sandwiches may be prepared at home, and if wrapped in oiled paper, 
or covered well with a damp napkin, will keep for quite a while. 

There are a few general rules to be observed in sandwich making. 
First, the condition of bread used is important. Bread made with milk 
will retain its moisture longer than water bread. It is best cut when 
one day old. 

White, Graham, Boston Brown, Rye, Whole Wheat Breads and rolls 
and crackers are used for making sandwiches. 

The butter should be in soft enough condition to spread easily, and 
each slice of bread should be buttered before being cut from loaf. For 
picnic sandwiches the bread should not be cut too thin. 

There are four general classes of sandwiches : sweet ones, meat sand- 
wiches, fish sandwiches, those filled with salad mixtures. 

For sweet sandwiches the filling is made of jam, orange marma- 
lade, fig paste, preserved ginger, chopped raisins, or raisins and nuts 
chopped together. Lettuce, watercress, and candied fruit are good gar- 
nishes for sweet sandwiches. 

Meat sandwiches are best when the meat is c^round and seasoned. It 
may be mixed with a meat or salad dressing. Pickles, olives, lettuce, 
watercress, parsley, and mint are the best garnishes for meat sandwiches. 

For salad sandwiches and cheese sandwiches pickles and olives are 
served. 

Fish sandwiches are garnished with pickles, olives, cress, parsley, 
slices of lemon, and hard boiled eggs. 

A few good recipes for each kind of sandwich will be given here. 

SWEET SANDWICHES 
Fig Sandwiches 
Chop one-fourth pound of figs very fine, add the same amount of 
water, and three tablespoons sugar and cook until a smooth paste. Add 



28 V ^ ECONOMICAL COOKING 

a third of a cup of chopped walnuts and the juice of half a lemon. Stir 
well. When cold spread the mixture upon a piece of white bread, and 
cover with another piece. 

Nut and Fruit Sandwiches 

Mash a half pound of prunes from which seeds have been removed, 
add a half pound of seedless raisins, the same amount of stoned dates, 
and a half pound of washed figs. To this add quarter of a pound of 
blanched almonds, a quarter of a pound of walnuts, and a half pound of 
pecans. Put through a meat chopper, and add the juice of two oranges. 
Mix well, and pack in a loaf. Slice in thin slices and place between 
slices of white bread. 

Cheese and Honey Sandwiches 

Spread a piece of buttered bread with a layer of cream cheese; over 
this spread a layer of honey and cover with another slice of bread. Serve 
as soon as honey has been added. Maple syrup may be substituted for 
honey. 

MEAT SANDWICHES 

Ham and Tongue Sandwich 

Chop a half pound of cold tongue and a fourth pound of boiled ham 
(cold) very fine; season with paprika and prepared mustard. Mix well, 
and press between two pieces of bread. 

Ham and Egg Sandwich 

Chop a pound of cold boiled ham very fine; add to it the yolks of 
four hard boiled eggs which have been run through a sieve. Chop two 
sweet pickles fine and add to the ham and eggs. Mix well after add- 
ing enough boiled dressing to make it spread well. 

Ham Sandwich 

Slice cold boiled ham thin ; spread with prepared mustard and place 
between rye bread. Garnish with pickle. 

Lamb Sandwich 

Chop two cupfuls of cold cooked lamb fine, add two tablespoons of 
grated cheese, a teaspoonful of mustard, salt and pepper to taste, and 
enough mayonnaise dressing to make a smooth paste. Spread on a slice 
of bread and cover. Garnish with pickle. 



THE SUBJECT OF CARVING 

By A. CHABRISON, Chef (irand Pacific Hotel, Chicago. 

Formerly Chef Union League Club. 



The mere mention of the wortl "carving" sets the cook to prick his ear^; in 
it he recognizes the bete noire of his existence, the destroyer of his peace of mind 
and the production of his skill. What beats the beauty and excellent arrangement 
of his dishes? To the eye they are beautiful and grand for the moment, but there 
comes the ruthless weapon of the amateur carver, and then woe to the works of the 
cook. He knows that good carvers are scarcer than good cooks, and yet upon 
the skill of him who serves the viands depends in a marked degree the success 
of the viand itself. Be the dish ever so tasty and ornamental, mucii of its artistic 
credit may be lost in the carving. 

"Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods, 
Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds." 

— Shakespeare. 

One compares a host who can not carve to an owner of a large and selected 
library who can not read. In fact one is as shameful as the other. 

The art of carving was looked upon by our French ancestors as essentially a 
part of good training. The last instructor provided to young men was a master 
carver, whose duty was to teach the sons how to carve and make them carve 
every day, adding practice and example to the precept. It was never given up 
until a full and complete course of this difficult art and a familiarity with the animal 
anatomy was mastered. Being proficient with the skill, the strength and nimbleness 
peculiar to a good practice, our ancestors most always did credit to their masters. 
Even those who could not have explained a verse of Virgil or a line of Cicero with 
an open book was well versed in the sinuosities of a duck, a goose or a turkey. 

It is particularly by the practice of such an art that one would recognize the 
owner of an hereditary fortune and the true born gentleman, who never was em- 
barrassed to do the honors of his table, and even at the table of others, taking pride 
in carving and serving personally the largest and most difficult pieces, executing 
it with a dexterity proving that, born in the upper class, he was from his infancy 
used to select pieces. 

^. The position of Ecuyer tranchant was in early times considered a very honor- 
able one and filled by a man who held first rank amongst the servants, fulfilling 
his duty with the sword at his side. That function passed away with royalty. Now 
the host takes pride in personally carving the choicest piece served at his table. 

Of late years the introduction of the service a la russe has ruined and almost 
destroyed that interesting part of our tables, and very few of our hosts can boast 
of his carving. Even very few stewards now-a-days are able to carve properly. The 
British only had the good common sense to retain their carver. In England the 
service a la russe has not prevailed over the magistral roast beef. Even in their 
inns and taverns hosts attend to that part of tlie duty of the chef. Now then, that 
the Ecuyer tranchant is a thing of the past, belonging to history, it becomes the 
duty of our present host to attend to the carving personally. 

CARVING POULTRY AND GAME. 

Few simple rules are to be observed in carving birds. The cuts may appear to 
be simple enough, but the difficulty is to carry them out successfully on the bird 
itself. From its shape alone some awkwardness arises, but it may be overcome 
by plunging the fork upright into the verv center of the breast bone and keeping 




IlEMO\ IN G THE LEG OF A TURKEY 

Second Process. — Now that the thigh is laid open, the leg can be ren-.oved with the 
point of the knife. In the above illustration, as well as in all others where the chef is 
seen, it will be noticed that he stands to the left and dissects the bird from that point. 
This is done for the purpose of permitting the photographer to get a good view of the 
operation. Ordinarily the carver sits in front of the bird and operates more from the 
right to the left rather than the angle shown in the picture. 




REMOVING THE WINli 
The Process.~Now that the leg is removed, the next process is to remove the wing. 
This ie accomplished by slicing a part of the breast, carving close to the ribs, and then 
when tae joint is reached, bend out this Hmb aNo, to expose the ioint. and then seve; 

■*vth a knifff. 




CARVING THE BREAST 

Fourth Process. — Having removed the legs and wings of the bird, they should be cut 
into two pieces, by passing the knife through the joints. The breast can now be sliced in thin, 
even slices, and served with the dark meat. 




SERVING THE DRESSING 

Fifth Process. — The-<lressmg is reached by making an incision between tue icgs oi 
<:he bird and lifting the apron just above the tail. It is served by means of a table spoon.

ROASTED DUCK 

Ducks are carved much the same way as other fowls, but as the legs are considered 
best, they are usually served first. Ducklings may be simply cut into four pieces, first by 
a lengthwise cut, and then crosswise.

Note: The foregoing illustrations can be relied upon as accurate, having been photo- 
graphed from life at the Grand Pacific Hotel, Chicago, at the recent reopening of that

CANVAS BACK DUCK 

With a canvas back duck only the breast is served. The joints, however, are frst 
removed in order that the breast and stuffing may be properly reached. 




CARVING A CAPON 

As will be seen, a capon is carved much the same way as a turkev. The blade of the 
Rnite should be held almost horizontally and pass right down to the bone of the leg. Then 
by bendmg the back of the knife downwards, the ioint is exposed. A dexterous movement

Chicken Sandwich 

Chop cold cooked chicken fine, season with salt and pepper. Add a 
little mayonnaise dressing and spread on white bread. Slice an olive over 
it before covering with the other piece of bread. This may be held over 
a hot fire long enough to toast outside of bread, just before eating. 

Frankfurt Sandwich 

Take several slices of plain buttered bread and a pound of uncooked 
frankfurt sausage. Roast the frankfurts over the fire, place between slices 
of bread, and eat with pickle while hot. 

SALAD SANDWICHES 

Cheese and Nut Salad Sandwich 

Run a cupful of shelled walnuts and two cupfuls of American cheese 
through a food chopper. Season with paprika and mix well with boiled 
salad dressing until it will spread easily. Place between two slices of 
bread. Garnish with olive or pickle. 

Green Pepper and Egg Sandwich 

Between two slices of buttered bread, place seedless green peppers 
which have been chopped well and mixed with chopped hard boiled eggs 
and salad dressing. Garnish with pickle. 

Beet and Cheese Sandwich 

Chop a cupful of cold cooked beets very fine, season, mix well with 
mayonnaise and spread on a piece of bread. Cover the other slice of 
bread with highly seasoned cream cheese, and press the two pieces of bread 
together. 

FISH SANDWICHES 

Sardine Sandwich 

Remove bones from two boxes of sardines. Put sardines in a bowl, 
add four hard boiled eggs chopped fine, the juice of one lemon, salt and 
pepper to taste, a tablespoonful of melted butter or olive oil, and chopped 
parsley. Mix to a paste and place between two slices of bread. 

Sardine and Cheese Sandwich 

Take equal parts of boned sardines and cream cheese. Mix well and 
season. Spread rve or white bread. Garnish with a pickle. 



28 X ECONOMICAL COOKING 

Salmon Sandwich 

To one can of salmon, add two sticks of celery and two pickles 
chopped fine. Squeeze over this the juice from half a lemon. Season 
with salt and pepper, add a teaspoonful of melted butter. Add enough 
mayonnaise to make a paste and spread between two slices of bread. 

THE BEVERAGE is of next importance. If the trip is to be for 
only one day, a thermos bottle may carry enough coffee or tea and keep it 
hot, but in case this will not hold enough, it is a good idea to take ground 
coffee, cocoa or tea with you. The coffee may be placed in a simple 
aluminum percolator and placed in a light-weight coffee pot. This saves 
carrying a strainer. A can of condensed milk and a box of sugar are then 
necessary. A good-sized water pail is essential. This may be used to pack 
provisions in while not in use. A frying pan with a detachable handle is 
useful. A stick may be inserted then for long distance frying. 

BUILDING THE FIRE is the first job. Large fires are unneces- 
sary. It is best to build a wigwam shaped place with kindling sticks. Leave 
plenty of air spaces between them, for fires require a great deal of air. 
Fire climbs, and if the sticks are arranged in conical form the fire will 
be better than if they were scattered carelessly. Start the fire by lighting 
some shaved pieces of wood first. It will not be long until there is a fire 
as hot as a blast furnace one. 

Hardwood is good, slow-burning fuel. When leaving the place never 
leave a fire or spark behind you. Put it out. 

Bacon, pork sausage, ham and eggs are easily and quickly cooked 
over a fire. They may be fried, or made into omelet. Eggs may be scram- 
bled ; bacon and ham are easily broiled or toasted. 

Potatoes laid in the fire may be baked while the meat, eggs or other 
vegetables and beverage are cooking over the fire. 

Salads or pudding desserts may be taken in glass jars with screw tops. 
The lettuce, if washed well and wrapped in a damp cloth and kept cool, 
will retain its freshness for days. 

Fresh fruits will complete the campers' lunch. 

Take only the necessary utensils for eating, old silverware or, if there 
is much danger of it being lost, tin knives, forks and spoons serve the pur- 
pose very well. Paper plates and napkins may be purchased at a very low 
cost. These save work as well as make the load lighter. 

Boxes of marshmallows, where space is no object, are desirable. 
They may be put on the ends of pointed sticks, held over the fire and roasted. 
Corn, on the cob, in season, is delicious roasted in the same manner.

LESSON III 
CHINESE DISHES 

The increased popularity of Chinese dishes has rendered a course of 
Domestic Science lessons incomplete that does not include them. 

The most popular one, chop suey, as an example of the others, may 
be varied in many ways. It may be made with an abundance of mush- 
rooms and called "mushroom chop suey." Chicken may be used in place 
of all other meat and we have "chicken chop suey." The onions may be 
omitted, and numerous other changes may be made to suit the taste. 

The recipe for plain chop suey is: 

Meat from 8 pork chops. 2 tablespoonf uls cornstarch 

2 c. mushrooms 3 tablespoonfuls bean sauce 

2 large onions i c. water 
I stalk celery 

I c. wheat sprouts (may be omitted) 

3 large slices bacon, cut fine and fried 
I tablespoon ful Worcestershire sauce 

Cut meat, mushrooms, celery and onions in small pieces. Chop onions 
if preferred. Blend cornstarch and sugar in warm water. Fry meat in 
bacon fat or olive oil until well browned, then add vegetables. Cook until 
they begin to brown. Last add water and cornstarch, bean sauce and 
Worcestershire sauce. Cook until thick and brown, stirring constantly. 

Egg Foyoung 

This is another very popular dish. It may be varied by adding dif- 
ferent foods until it is 

Lobster Egg Foyoung Asparagus Egg Foyoung 

Shrimp Egg Foyoung Pork Egg Foyoung and 

Chicken Egg Foyoung Green Pepper Egg Foyoung 

Plain tgg foyoung is made as follows! Beat two eggs until light. 
Pour over one cup of chopped celery, one-half cup bamboo tips, one-half 
cup of chopped water chestnuts. Season with salt and pepper. Mix well, 
cook over a slow fire, dropping in frying pan one large spoonful at a time, 
forming individual cakes.

A gravy is always served over it. This is made by mixing one tea- 
spoonful of cornstarch, one-half teaspoonful sugar and a little pepper with 
one-fourth cup of bean sauce and enough water to make a thin gravy. 
Stir constantly, cooking over a slow fire. Serv€ with rice. 



Chow Meine 

Chop and mix one cupful of chopped veal, one and a half cups of 
celery, one-half cup of water chestnuts, one-half cupful mushrooms, and 
one-half cupful of bamboo tips, chopped fine. Cook over slow fire, stir- 
ring constantly until meat is done, and vegetables are tender. 

Then steam three cupfuls of noodles until they become soft, and fry 
in deep fat until light brown. Smother with first mixture and serve. 



Fried Rice 

The Chinese serve rice with nearly all of their other dishes. It is 
boiled so that each grain remains separate from the rest, and is very dry. 
This is done by adding water enough to rice to come one inch over the top 
of it. Let it come to a boil, and stir once. Then cover very tightly, so that 
no steam escapes and let cook over a very slow fire until dry (about an 
hour. Do not stir while cooking or rice will become pasty. 

Then for fried rice, chop the tops of two green onions fine. Add lob- 
ster, shrimp, chicken or mushrooms, chopped fine, to this. Then cut two 
or three large slices of bacon into fine pieces and fry in pan until it starts 
to brown ; break an ^gg into grease and scramble it. Then add two cups 
of boiled rice, the chopped onion tops, and mushrooms or other ingredient, 
and warm all together, stirring well, so as to cut and mix ^gg and bacon 
with the rest. Season to taste. 

Mushrooms, both black and white, are used freely in Chinese cookery. 
These may be bought dried, and freshened for use by soaking a few 
minutes before using. 

Water chestnuts are also very common in these dishes, but not as easy 
to obtain. 

Cumquats, or little oranges, ginger root and mixed preserves are 
imported from China, as well as canned fruits, such as lichee, pineapple 
and booloo. 



ST. PATRICK'S DAY. 

{March ly) 

"There's a dear little Island far over the sea, 
And no spot on the globe's half so precious to me; 
And by lake or mountain where e'er I may roam, 
I shall never forget thee, my own Ireland home. 
Other skies may be bright, other lands may be fair. 
But what of all that if the heart be not there ? 
Other music may charm me, but ah ! there is none 
Which can move me to sadness or mirth like thine own." 

As green is the prevailing color on St. Patrick's Day, I have suggested a din- 
ner menu where this color and white are used exclusively. Let a dish of ferns be 
made the centerpiece and scatter ferns about the table. Let Irish flags decorate 
the room. Have the china green and white, so far as possible. 

Green silk embroidered ovei a small wire, to imitate the shamrock, placed at 
each plate, for a boutonnihe, is quite appropriate and novel. 

"Oh! the Shamrock, the green, immortal Shamrock? 
Chosen Leaf 
Of Bard and Chief, 
Old Erin's native Shamrock!"

- -Rah! 'Rahl for the jolly old Fourth of Julyl" 

The United States Is the only country with a known 
birthday. All the rest began, they know not when, and grew 
into power, they know not how. If there had been no Independence Day, Eng- 
land and America combined would not be so great as each actually is. There is 
no "Republican," no "Democrat," on the Fourth of July — all are Americans. 
All feel that their country Is greater than party. — James G. Blaine. 

Let it not be forgotten that patriotism is one of the positive lessons to be 
taught In every home. Everything learned should be flavored with a genuine love 
of country. Every glorious fact in the nation's history should be emphasized. 
Every person should feel that he is entitled to a share, not only in the blessings 
conferred by his government, but also in the rich memories and glorious achieve- 
ments of his country. — Richard Edwards. 

[Directions for the decoration of a dining-room on the Fourth of July are 
almost superfluous. Only flags, banners, bunting and flowers, representing the colors 
of the country are required to make It delightfully attractive.]

While the dictionary definition of Halloween Is rather different than thf 
modern small boy's interpretation of it would indicate, yet we say with all earaeei 
ness, give the boys a good time occasionally, and why not on Halloween? 

"Wi' metry songs, and friendly crack, 
I wat they did na weary ; 
And unco tales, an' funnie jokes, 
Their sports were cheap and cheary. 

— ''Bobbie" Burns. 

Boys will be far less apt to carry off the clothes-posts, unhinge the gates, and 
make night hideous, if you give them a party in keeping with the occasion — a 
party wnere tin horns form the first course at the dinner-table — where colored 
paper napkins, folded to represent the "jack-be-nimble" and "jack-be-quicks," 
"toads," "monkeys," and "parrots"; where paper caps adorn the head and 
where jack-lanterns adorn the room. Such an evening makes glad even the heart 
of Aunt Jemima and Uncle Ben. And so, why not the boys?

Washington's Birthday 



"Statesmen, yet friend to truth! of soul sincere, 
In action faithful, and in honor clear! 
Who broke no promise, serv'd no private end. 
Who gained no title and who lost no friend. 
Ennobled by himself, by all approved." 

ORTUNATE is the housekeeper who has 
old-fashioned blue and white china and 
twice fortunate is she who ha? heir- 
looms of silver, pewter and glass. Make 
the decorations festive and holiday-like. 
Red and white carnations in a blue bowl, 
make a pretty centerpiece to the table, 
or, prettier still, is red, white and blue 
crinkled paper, neatly wound around ajar 
of green with an artistic bow at the side. If one has a Jerusalem cherry tree so 
much the better. 

Narrow red, white and blue ribbons can be tied in the corners of the place 
cards. She that is artistically i'lclined can trace thereon a little hatchet and under- 
neath the words: "I cannot tell a lie," or, "First in war, first in peace, and first in

Mil ess 



A WRITER on the art of cooking has made the assertion that there is 
more waste among the poor than among the rich, and explains it 
by saying that the former have not learned how to use the odds and ends 
that come in their way, while the latter have brought it to perfection. 
Wastefulness is no indication of a generous nature, and yet we have met 
those who imagined that if they did not show a careless, improvident, 
spirit that they would be considered close. No greater mistake can be 
made than this. Does not the Bible speak of the careful wife thus: "She 
looketh well to the ways of her household, and eateth not the bread of 
idleness." 

ECONOMICAL LIVINQ. 

To the young housekeeper whose first steps in the care of a home are 
but a series of experiments, the words economy, comfort, and thrift saay 
have but little meaning, but, ere long, the wish to make the most of every 
new relation will cause her to ask imperatively for advice in this direc- 
tion. 

First, in the scale of economics, comes the knowledge of "how to 
choose" that which is nearest the ideal in nourishment, and "how to cook 
it" so as to get the greatest benefit out of it. 

In our favored land, meat is one of the principal articles of diet, but 
in the older countries, the laboring man is only able to obtain it once or 
twice a week. Perhaps the all-wise Father so ordained it, if it be true, 
as modern physicians tell us, that meat makes muscle not strength. 
A small family in America will often waste what in a French home would 
be enough to keep a household, for all the details of a French woman's 
kitchen, no matter whether she be rich or poor, are managed with the 
utmost economy. The food, although inexpensive, is cooked with such 
relish, and in such disguises, as to induce a belief that an entirely new 
dish is presented. 

WHEN AND HOW TO BUY. 

No more of any article for consumption should be purchased than 
necessary for the number constituting the family. Many things for the 



88 



WASTEFULI^ESS. 




(^^3^i^ 



table are excessively dear in certain seasons. It is very 
improvident to buy such articles out of season. Rather 
bring into use what is more readily procurable, by 
varying the manner of cooking it, serving it up in differ- 
ent styles. That is the variety that will give the most 
satisfaction, and even if there is not so lavish an out- 
lay, health and contentment will be certain to reward 
the effort. The art of cookery is a high-sounding 
phrase to some, and yet it means merely the exercise 
of a little taste and judgment, the putting together of 
what materials one has with good results. 

Economy may at first be hard to learn, but it is 
valuable. When the housewife acquires the habit of 
making the best use of all she possesses, she will then 
be economical without being stingy, liberal without 
wasting, and will learn how to provide a frugal table 
with frequent changes far more agreeable to the taste 
than expensive ones, and a sameness in the articles 
served. 

HOW TO UTILIZE EYERYTHINQ. ; 

The tendency to waste is more likely to occur in 
small families where the mistress of the home is at a 
loss to know what to do with the small portions left 
over from various meals, than in large families where 
the odds and ends can be used for next day's meals. In 
large cities, the utilizing of such fragments is not so 
grave a matter, for there are plenty of wandering 
travelers who will accept them gladly; in smaller towns, 
where the poor are fewer, the question is more serious. 
The article most frequently wasted is bread, every 
crumb of which should be saved. It can be converted 
into toast or placed in the oven to dry. When dry it 
can be grated coarsely and put into wide-mouthed 
covered jars for puddings, stuffings, or thickening for 
meat gravies. Other pieces not large enough for toast, 
can be converted into griddle cakes. Then there is the 
bread pudding, and if the children, or the older mem- 
bers of the family, grow tired of the economical bread pudding with lemon 
sauce, try the same in custard cups with raisins for fruit. Butter the 
cups, fill, and then bake them, standing in a pan of hot water. Cover 





ODDS AND

iVA S TE FULNESS. SO" 

each one with a teaspoon of bright-colored jelly and to the family it will 
no longer be a simple bread pudding, but a rich new dish, to be eaten 
with cream. 

The bones of a roast can be cracked and put into the bean soup, giv- 
ing it a nice flavor. Cold roast beef can be sliced thin and warmed over 
in its own gravy for a breakfast or luncheon dish. Some turn it into hash, 
but cold corned beef, after it has been sliced one or twice for tea, makes 
the best hash. If you like, you can chop cold cabbage and cold beets that 
have not been in vinegar, with the potatoes and meat, and a dish that any 
one should enjoy will be the result. If you chance to have no cold vege- 
tables, chop the corned beef very fine, fry and lay it over dry toast in a 
platter, after first pouring a spoonful of boiling water upon the toast, to 
moisten it. 

Scraps of ham can be chopped, bread-crumbs added, a little butter 
and some of the fat; then make layers of ham and bread, set it in the 
oven, and you have escalloped ham. 

The proper care and use of drippings, as well as of the fat cut from the 
edge of steaks, should be known and practiced by all housekeepers. For 
frying purposes they are more wholesome than lard, many persons who 
are unable to partake of food fried in the latter find no trouble with the 
use of the former; besides, the drippings do not spatter from the pan as 
does lard, and are, therefore, more desirable on the score of cleanliness. 
For frying fish, potatoes, and such food as does not require butter, they 
will be found very satisfactory. To clarify drippings pour on boiling 
water, stir thoroughly and set aside until the following day, then put into 
a saucepan with boiling water and a little salt and allow to simmer slowly, 
skimming well until the water has evaporated; strain into an earthen 
vessel and keep covered. If the work has been well done so as to remove 
the water and all impurities, it will keep for weeks. Turkey and chicken 
fat can be saved for making soup. 

Sour milk makes cottage cheese, a recipe for which will be found 
under its proper heading; it also makes good biscuits and griddle 
cakes. 

Potted meats can be made of fragments cut from the bone, pounded 
in a mortar and seasoned; they make fine canapes for luncheon. The 
tough ends of steaks can be chopped and made into Hamburg steak or 
cornish pastry; the recipe is in this book. 

Potatoes left over are capable of so many ways of re-serving that it is 
almost unnecessary to mention them. They reappear in potato cakes, in 
hash, in soups, and in many other forms. 



40 WASTEFULNESS. 

Egg-shells are useful for clearing soups, jellies and coffee. Soft- 
boiled eggs left over can be reboiled, and when hard, take their place in 
garnishing, in salads, in pressed meats, and on toast. The canary never 
objects to a tiny taste. Cold fried or scrambled eggs need not be wasted 
but chopped and mixed with mince meat to make excellent stuffed rolls. 
If eggs are required for the white alone, save the yolks in a cup, wet a 
cloth, place it over them, and keep in a cold place till wanted. 

Oatmeal and other cereals, left over, answer well to be added to that 
made fresh the next day, or they can be fried for breakfast and eaten 
with maple syrup. 

Vegetables left over may go into the soup designed for next day's 
dinner. Canned fruits should be watched; if they show signs of working 
they should be stewed at once. Apple parings and pulps that are sound 
need not be thrown away. Stew to a pulp, strain and sweeten and you 
have apple butter, peach butter and excellent filling for tarts. 

Cold rice is easily made into a pudding, into croquettes, or better still, 
is fine as a thickening for broth. 

If ice is not obtainable set milk in a cold place or boil to keep it 
sweet. Flour and meal must be kept covered, and tea and coffee are best 
preserved in closed canisters. Add a tablespoon of cornstarch to each 
pint of salt, mix well and you will not be troubled by salt clogging or 
becoming damp. Butter keeps best in stone jars, bread and cake retain 
their freshness in tin. 

Apples should remain out of doors in barrels until too cool for them. 
When brought in, set in a dry room, until the weather requires their being 
put into the cellar. A linen cloth laid over the barrel will keep them 
from frost till very cold weather. Many prefer not to head up the barrels 
of apples. There is an advantage in being able to pick them over several 
times in the course of winter, as one defective apple injures all its neigh- 
bors. If moist, wipe them. 

Herbs should be gathered when just beginning to blossom; they are 
then in their perfection. Medicinal herbs should be dried, put up into paper 
bags and labeled. Those used in cooking should be pounded, sifted and 
put into labeled boxes or bottles. They retain their virtues best dried by 
artificial heat. The warmth of an oven a few hours after the bread is 
drawn is sufficient. 

If in making pies a few scraps of dough are left, gather them in a 
mass, roll them out thin, cut them into fancy shapes, prick them with a 
fork, and bake in a quick oven. Make into tarts or sift fine sugar upon 
them and arrange round a dish of stewed fruitc 




CARVING 




TO CARVE gracefully is an accomplishment that depends wholly 
upon skill and not upon strength. The present fashion of dinners 
(see page 23) is perhaps removing the necessity, from some circles, for 
knowing how to carve, but still, not so generally as to do away with it 
altogether. We believe that ladies, as well as gentlemen, should make 




LEG OF MUTTON. 

carving a study so that at the family dinner if the host be absent the 
hostess can perform the task without assistance from a guest, whose skill 
is perhaps not perfect, but whose good nature would not allow him to 
refuse. 

HOW TO CARVE. 

To carve with ease, one of the first requisites is a good knife well 
sharpened before coming to the table. It is a most uncomfortable and 

41 



42 



CARVING. 



disagreeable sound to hear the carver whetting the knife while the guests 
are waiting to be served. The knife should be used for no other purpose 
than carving. It should never be found in the kitchen, cutting vegetables, 
meat and breads, its sole ofhce being to carve the meats brought to table- 
Heat destroys its temper. A sharp, strong, blade, a good handle, and a 
keen edge are qualities belonging to a good carving knife. 

Another point to be observed in carving, is to always cut at right 
angles with the fibers of the joint. When a joint is properly carved, it is 
more agreeable to the eye, pleasanter to the taste and much more easily 
masticated. , 

HOW TO SIT WHEN CARVING. 

The person who is carving should be provided with a chair a little 
higher than the ordinary pattern, and should always sit, not stand, if a 
creditable appearance is desired. The platter which holds the meat 
should be large enough to admit of placing the slices as they are cut, on 
one side of the dish, from whence they can be distributed. A linen doily 
placed underneath the platter containing the meat, will catch any crum.bs 
that would otherwise fall upon and soil the table-cloth. 




In serving fish, avoid breaking the flakes. This can be done by the 
use of a fish trowel. The middle portion of the fish is considered the 
choicest, but the tail end is the sweetest. 

When carving rib or sirloin of beef, cut the slices thin, and from the 
side next to you. Never offer any one the outside piece, unless they ask 
for it, but inquire how each guest prefers his — whether rare or well done. 
In cutting corned beef, begin at the top, but avoid giving out the outside 
slice, as it is generally hard. 



CARVING 



43 




TENDERLOIN ROAST. 

The tenderloin roast is the choicest part of the beef. It is usually 
rolled up and held in place by skewers. The butcher generally puts it up 
for his customers in this fashion. Whatever scraps are taken off should 
be saved for the soup pot. To carve a tenderloin roast cut thin slices 
clear across the top, as indicated in the figure from A to B. 




SIRLOIN BEEF. 



Next to the tenderloin roast the sirloin is considered the finest part of 
the beef. The bone, B to D in the figure, should be removed before 
roasting. The part below is the tenderloin part, while t' at portion above 



44 



CARVING. 



the bone is the sirloin part. Carve by passing the knife with a good firm 
hand clear down the length of the side beginning at A, cutting through 
to I. The slices should be thin, long and even^ 



\ ^ ^ \ > 






f ' ' ' « 



BREAST OF VEAL. 



The breast of veal consists of two parts, the gristly brisket proper and 
the rib bones. Separate the two parts by passing the knife through the 
veal from B to A. Now begin carving the ribs by passing the knife from 
E to F. Some people are fond of the brisket, so it is well to cut a few 
pieces, C to D. 




FORE-QUARTER LAMB, 



CARVING 



45 



In cutting a leg of mutton begin across the middle, cutting the slices 
way down to the bone, as shown by the letters A, B (see page 45). Some 
prefer to cut it at the end, from G to F, in form of a semi-circle, E E E. 
This part contains more fat. Ham should be divided in the same manner, 
remembering always that the slices should be thin, but well across. 
Boiled tongue should be cut crosswise, leaving the root in the dish. 

A forequarter of lamb can be served by separating the shoulder part 
from the breast and ribs. This can be done by passing the knife under 
and dividing the ribs — see dotted lines C D E. Cut through the skin, 
then raise with a little force the shoulder into which the fork should be 
firmly set. Next divide the ribs from the brisket by cutting from A to B* 
then it will be easy to carve the ribs, F to G, and the brisket, from H to I 




TURKEY. 



To carve a fowl, separate first the wings and legs and thighs. Then 
cut slices from both sides of the breast, as in the figure C to B. Make an 
opening in the turkey for the purpose of serving the dressing. (See A.) 
Serve the breast, thighs and wings first, with dressing added, leaving the 
back till the last. All fowls, partridges, and grouse, are served in the 
same way. When helping to gravy, do not pour it over the meat, but put 
it on one side of the plate, to be used by the guest as best preferred. Small 
birds, as quails, woodcock and pigeons, are split down the back and a half 
given to each person. 

It soon becomes easy to acquire a knowledge of joints, and any one 
can become an expert who tries to learn the relative position of the bones 
and joints. A quiet demeanor and a cool head are essential to success.

HOW TO MAKE THEM. 

A GREAT French authority on cooking says that soup bears the same 
relation to the dinner that a doorway bears to a house, and, it is 
safe to say, too, that no other dish is capable of such variation, and none 
has received so much attention from the cooks of all ages and all nation- 
alities. There are at present about two hundred and ninety different 
kinds. When made of good material and in a proper manner, they are 
more nourishing than almost any other kind of food. 

KINDS OF SOUP. 

Soups are divided into two kinds — meat and vegetable. As the 
latter properly belong to Part II., only soups with meats will be found 
under this heading. In the making of meat soups, it is a matter of taste 
as to what portion of the beef shall be selected for making them. Some 
housekeepers prefer the shin bone, as it contains the marrow, which adds 
strength and thickness to the soup, while others like the neck, as that 
makes a more nutritious soup. 

There are three classes of soup — clear, thick and purees. The first is 
clear and thin; the second, about as thick as cream but not transparent, 
while in a puree, all the ingredients entering into its composition, are 
rubbed through a sieve. 

The flesh of old animals contains greater flavor than does the flesh 
of the young ones, while dark meat contains more than white meat

MEAT SOUPS. 

In making meat soups, put the meat into cold water and allow it to 
boil slowly, then simmer for three or four hours, — never ceasing to sim- 
mer. Watch carefully for the albumen to rise, when it must be skimmed 
off, again and again, until it is perfectly clear. Soup should always be 
made in a granite or enamel-lined kettle, as it is healthier and the color 
is, at the same time clearer. Beware of using too much salt; a little is 
better. More can be added as the soup boils down. Onions should be 
added as soon as the soup boils. When making a thick soup, the vermi- 
celli, rice, or whatever thickening is used, should be partly cooked before 

adding. J. L. S. 

ORDINARY RULE FOR MEAT SOUP. 

The ordinary rule in making meat soup is to use a quart of cold water 
to each pound of meat and bone. If the liquid boils away in cooking, add 
water from the tea-kettle that is boiling. Lukewarm or cold water will 
injure the flavor. 

Parsely pounded and bruised and put in the soup a few moments 
before done, gives a nice color. The same is true of celery. Grated car- 
rot imparts a nice color also. Another good coloring for soup is burnt 
sugar. A little spinach pounded and added will give a green color. 

C0NS0MM6 OR PLAIN MEAT STOCK FOR SOUP. 

Consomme or stock forms the basis of all meat soups, gravies and 
purees. The simpler it is made, the longer it keeps. It is best made of 
fresh, uncooked beef and some broken bones, to which may be added the 
remnants of broken meats. In a home where flesh forms part of the 
every-day diet, a good cook will seldom be without a stock-pot. 

Four pounds of beef and broken bones, one gallon of cold water and 
two teaspoonfuls of salt. Put the meat and water on the back of the 
stove and let it slowly come to a boil, then simmer three or four hours, 
until the water is boiled away one-half; add the salt, strain and set to 
cool, in an earthenware dish well covered. When cold, take the fat off 
the top and it is ready for use. To make soup for a family of six, — take 
one quarter of the stock, to which add one quart of boiling water, and any 
vegetables desired — boil three hours. Season with salt and pepper. 

MIXED STOCK FOR SOUPS. 

To six pounds of lean beef, with the bones well cracked, add six 
quarts of water. Put the beef, bones and water in a covered kettle on the 
stove to heat slowly. Let it boil gently for six hours. After it has boiled 



SOUPS. 51 

for six hours, strain and set aside well covered until the next day. Before 
needed, remove the fat, set the soup over the fire and throw in a little 
salt, two carrots, two onions, one turnip, one head of celery. Stew in 
sufficient water to cover them. When tender, add the vegetables and the 
water in which they were cooked, to the soup. Boil slowly for one-half 
hour. Strain when done. A bay-leaf added to the stock before cooking 
the second day, adds greatly to the flavor. M. R, D. 

WHITE STOCK. 

This stock forms an excellent basis for many soups. Rice, barley, 
vermicelli, macaroni, peas and beans, previously cooked, may be added. 
This provides a good use for vegetables left from yesterday's dinner. 

White stock is used in the preparation of white soups, and is made 
by putting six pounds of a knuckle of veal or lean beef and veal gravy 
one-quarter of a pound of bacon or ham cut up in small pieces over 
the fire in six quarts of cold water, with four onions and four heads of 
celery cut up fine. Stew gently until nearly done, when salt should be 
added. Cook one hour longer; strain and set to cool. When cold remove 
fat and it is ready for use. Cook. 

EQQ BALLS FOR 50UP. 

Rub the yolks of four hard-boiled eggs with a little melted butter, to 
a paste. Add a little pepper and salt. Beat two raw eggs and add to 
above, with flour enough to make them hold together. Make into balls, 
put in soup and let boil one minute. Mrs, E. Brown. 

TOASTED BREAD CRUSTS FOR SOUP. 

Toast bread crusts in front of a very small fire, and on a wire toaster. 
When brown on both sides, cut the bread into very small dice before serv- 
ing. Untoasted bread swells, and is likely to spoil the appearance of the 

soup. Mamie Allen, 

NOODLES FOR SOUP. 

Take two eggs, butter the size of a walnut, three tablespoons sour 
cream, flour enough to make a rather stiff dough; knead, roll out very 
thin and cut in narrow strips; cook half an hour or less. Mrs. Rose. 

NOODLES— No. 2. 

Use one &gg, one-half an eggshell of water, pinch of salt. Mix stifl 
with flour. Lay on napkin to dry; roll like jelly cake. Cut as thin as 
wafers. Mrs. Mason Doane. 



52 SOUPS. 

HERB POWDER FOR SOUPS. 

It is not always possible to obtain fresh herbs, and so, a good way to 
obtain a flavoring for soups is to procure them in season fresh, just before 
they begin to flower; dry them in a warm, but not hot, oven; pound them 
fine and pass through a wire sieve. The powder should then be put into 
small bottles, stoppered closely, and kept dry. The proportions are as 
follows: Two ounces of sweet marjoram, two ounces of winter savory, two 
ounces of dried parsely, two ounces of thyme, half an ounce of bay-leaves, 
a quarter of an ounce of celery-seed, an ounce of sweet basil, and an 
ounce of lemon-peel. A. W. Cutter. 

CONSOMME WITH RICE AND CREAH. 

Put one quart of plain consomme made after the above recipe, in a 
stew-pan and when it has come to a boil add a pint of boiling water 
and one-half cup of cold boiled rice. Boil for ten minutes, then add one 
teaspoonful each of sugar and salt and a cup of cream. 

Emma Hoffman. 
CONSOMME WITH PEARL BARLEY. 

Put one quart of consomme, made after the above recipe for plain con- 
somme in a granite kettle, add one-fourth of a cup of well-washed pearl 
barley, and one pint of boiling water. Let boil forty-five minutes. Add 
one-third of a cup of cold breast of chicken cut in dice, two tablespoonfuls 
of peas previously cooked, and serve on crisp crackers. 

P. R. Saur. 
CONSOMME WITH EQQ BALLS. 

Use one quart of the above recipe for plain consomme put over to 
boil, adding to it one quart of boiling water. Just before taking from 
the stove put in a few balls made by rubbing smoothly together the yolks 
of two hard-boiled eggs seasoned with a dash of salt and pepper, one tea- 
spoonful of melted butter, one-fourth teaspoonful of finely minced parsley 
and just enough slightly beaten raw &gg to bind together. Mold into 
balls like small marbles. Mrs. R. McCall. 

VEAL BROTH. 

Cut four pounds of scrag of veal into small pieces, and put into a stew- 
pan. Pour over three quarts of water, and place over the fire. Skim 
carefully. Add an onion, a turnip, three blades of mace, and a little salt- 
Stew all slowly for two hours. Then strain through a sieve and add a 
quarter of a pound of rice that has been boiled tender. Boil ten minutes 
more and serve. Mrs. H. Harrington

parsley cut in the same way as the other vegetables, after being immersed 
in boiling water for a minute. Boil half an hour longer, skim carefully,

A BRAIN FOOD. 

FISH Is pronounced by medical authority to be the best "brain food/* 
of all the meats. It is also more easily digested than the flesh of ani- 
mals. In cooking fish the first care of the housewife is to be certain that 
the fish she is about to cook is perfectly fresh and thoroughly clean. In 
boiling fish, it should be put into warm water and boiled gently. In 
removing it from the kettle, avoid breaking the skin as it gives the fish a 
ragged appearance. Some cooks have kettles with a strainer on the bot- 
tom. The usual garnishes of fish are slices of lemon and sprigs of parsley. 
In frying fish, the fat should be boiling and cover the fish. Best 
results are obtained when the fish is rolled in flour or bread-crumbs. The 
best color is obtained when the fish is fried in Ko-nut, a vegetable oil 
spoken of quite at length in Part II. 



BROOK TROUT. 

These delightful fish are usually fried. Wash and dry the fish, being 
certain that they are dry inside as well as outside, sprinkle a little pepper 
and salt over them, and roll in corn meal. Use one part butter, to two 
parts lard to fry a golden brown. Drain, and serve with slices of bacon 
and hard-boiled eggs cut in rings and laid around the platter. It takes 
about eight minutes to fry them. Mrs. Julia Eaton. 

BAKED HADDOCK. 

Scale and clean a three-pound fish; fill with forcemeat and sew up, 
sprinkle over a generous supply of salt and bread-crumbs; put three even 
tablespoonfuls of butter in tiny pieces on the fish; bake three-quarters of 
an hour, basting frequently. 1, H. B.

oyster sauce. 

Oyster Sauce. — Parboil a half-pint of medium-sized oysters, drain off 
the liquor and add enough milk to make a generous pint of sauce. Cook

BOILED STURGEON. 

Cut the fish into thin slices like veal cutlets, rub them over with but-

FRIED SriELTS. 

These delicate little fish cannot be opened as can larger fish. Cut off 
the head and pull the insides through the gills. Wash and dry in a cloth, 
then roll them in flour or bread-crumbs three or four times till they are

and a mere suspicion of minced onion — one teaspoonful of Worcester- 
shire sauce, one-half a teacup of melted butter, juice of one-half a lemon, 
one beaten &gg. Lay the fish in cold, salted water for half an hour, then 
wipe dry and stuff with a forcemeat, made of the crumbs, pork, herbs, 
onion, and seasoning, bound with the beaten &gg. Lay in the baking- 
dish, and pour over it the melted butter, which should be quite thin, 
seasoned with the sauce. Bake in a moderate oven for an hour, or 
longer, if the piece is large, basting frequently, lest it should brown too 
fast. Add a little butter and water if the sauce thickens too much. 
When the fish is done, remove it to a hot dish, strain the gravy over, and 
serve. Mrs. Charles Ebert.

is not stuffed, sprinkle a little salt and cayenne in the inside, and place 
an ounce of butter there. Egg and bread-crumb it twice. Season the 
bread-crumbs with salt and cayenne, and mix with them a third of their 
quantity in shredded parsley. Pour clarified butter over the fish, and bake 
in a moderate oven. Lay a buttered paper over the dish. Any good fish 
sauce may be sent to table with pike dressed in this way. 

Mrs. Clarinda Elliott, 

BAKED PIKE— No. 2. 

After scaling and cleaning the pike, cut it across in slices of a uni- 
form thickness, and mix some slices of raw onion, a piece of butter, pep- 
per, salt, and half a pint of sour cream. Lay it over the slices, in a baking 
pan, and put them in the oven. Bake twenty minutes, basting it with the 
cream often. Strew cracker crumbs and grated cheese over the fish, and 
brown. Remove the slices of pike to a hot platter, pour some stock in 
the baking pan with some lemon juice, salt and pepper; stir a couple of

Parker House. 
SCALLOPED SALMON. 

Shred one can of salmon, place in a baking dish in layers; first, a 
layer of rolled cracker crumbs, then one of salmon, butter, salt and pep- 
per; repeat until dish is nearly filled. Then take a tablespoonful each of 
butter and flour beaten well together and stir it into a cup of boiling milk; 
when thoroughly cooked, stir in a beaten ^^^\ pour this over dish and 
bake. When nicely browned it is done. Miss M. A. Stone. 

SCALLOPED SALnON— No. 2. 

Canned salmon forms the basis of many nice dishes. Turn the con- 
tents of a can into an earthen bowl for an hour before using. Never let a 
tin of meat, vegetables or fruit stand after it is opened, but turn out the 
contents at once into some crockery or stone dish. Pick the salmon into 
small fragments, mix with one-third the quantity of bread-crumbs and add 
a beaten ^%%, two tablespoonfuls of melted butter and a teaspoonful of 
lemon juice for every pint of the mixture; season to taste, put in a but- 
tered dish, dust with crumbs and bake brown. 

A nice cream sauce is made for canned salmon by adding the fish, as 
it comes fromthe can, to a pint of the sauce, and garnishing with bits of 
toast. M. E. H. 

SALMON— AU ENTREE. 

Remove from the can; break up carefully, taking away all the oil, and

hardwood board about an inch and one-half thick with the skin side down 
and fasten it with some tacks, put the board over the fire, rubbing it 
once in a while with butter, and roast until done. The plank should be 
well seasoned and heated before placing the shad upon it or the fish will 
partake of the flavor of the wood. When done turn on a hot dish, 
sprinkle over it some salt and pepper, and drop upon it small bits of but- 
ten Serve with slices of lemon. The Bourse, Philadelphia. 

BROILED SHAD. 

(Washington Style.) 

Split a good-sized shad down the back and lay on a platter, upon 
which is one tablespoonful of olive oil, and a little salt and pepper; leave 
it here an hour, but turn occasionally. Rub the bars of a double gridiron 
with oil to prevent sticking, lay the fish on and broil slowly, doing the 
inside first. Turn frequently. It will take from ten to fifteen minutes, 
according to the size of fish, to cook. When the bone can be easily lifted 
it is a sign that the cooking is sufficient; take off the bone, spread over 
a generous piece of butter, salt and pepper, and set in the oven for a 
minute. Excellent. Arlington Hotel, Washington, D. C. 

BAKED SHAD. 

Remove the scales and entrails but do not cut off the tail or head. 
Wash thoroughly and wipe dry. Fill with a dressing made of one cup of

cupful of drawn butter and serve at once. Mrs. I. Tibbitts. 

BOILED FLOUNDERS. 

Lay the fish in a kettle, with salt and water in the proportion of six 
ounces of salt to each gallon, and a little vinegar. Let the water boil a 
minute or so, then remove it to the side to simmer till done. The fish 
must not boil fast, or they will break. They should simmer fifteen min- 
utes. _ Hazel. 

BOILED HALIBUT. 

Purchase a thick slice cut through the body, or the tail piece, which is 
considered the richest. Wrap it in a floured cloth and lay It in warm 
water with salt in it. A piece weighing six pounds should be cooked in 
half an hour after the water begins to boil. Melted butter and parsley are 
eaten with it. If any is left, lay it in a deep dish and sprinkle on it a little 
salt, throw over it a dozen cloves, pour in some vinegar, and it will, when 
cold, have much the flavor of lobster. Mrs. Sarah Todd. 

BAKED BASS. 

Make a filling of pounded cracker or crumbs of bread, an Qgg, pep- 
per, clove, salt and butter. Fill it very full, an when sewed up, grate 
over it a small nutmeg and sprinkle it with pounded cracker. Then pour 
on the white of an ^gg, and a little melted butter. Bake it an hour in the 
same dish in which it is to be served. Portland House, Me. 

FRIED FINNAN HADDIES. 

Rub Ko-nut oil on both sides of the fish, and set it in a frying-pan with 
plenty of butter. Shake the pan over a clear fire. Three minutes will 
cook it. Then rub a little butter over it and send to table.

with as much good brown gravy, boiling, was will swim it. Add a little 
salt and cayenne, the juice of half a lemon, a lump of sugar, an onion 
stuck with two cloves, and a little tomato catsup. Simmer softly till the 
fish is cooked; take it out, place it on a hot dish, strain the gravy, thicken- 
ing it with a little browned butter. L W. M. 



72 FISH. 



FRIED PERCH. 



After washing and scaling the fish wipe them dry, flour them lightly 
all over; rub off the flour, dip them into beaten ^gg, and then into finely- 
grated bread-crumbs, and fry them in plenty of boiling fat, until they are 
nicely browned. Drain a few minutes on an inverted sieve, serve on a 
hot dish, and garnish with parsley. Send shrimp sauce, anchovy sauce, 
or plain melted butter, to table in a tureen. Mrs. Eliza Pray. 

BROILED SARDINES. 

These tiny fish are very nice when broiled over hot coals a minute or 
so, turning them once. Large slices of toast must be ready; on each 
slice place two of the fish, and then pour a little of the oil which was left 
in the can. The oil must be hot. Inez Heffel. 

RED HERRINGS. 

Red herrings or Yarmouth bloaters can be cooked by making incisions 
in the skin across the fish, for a very little cooking will do them. If there 
is any roe, pound it in a mortar, with a little anchovy, and spread it on 
toast. When the herrings are very dry, soak them in warm water an hour 
before cooking. P. A. Thrall. 

SALMON CUTLETS WITH CAPER SAUCE. 

Take a slice of salmon two inches thick, carefully remove the bones 
and skin, cut into slices half an inch thick, and flatten them on the chop- 
ping-board with a cutlet bat dipped in water. From these slices cut as 
many cutlets of as uniform shape as you can. Place them quite flat on a 
well-buttered baking tin, sprinkle pepper and salt over them, and, ten min- 
utes before they are wanted, put them into the oven with a sheet of but- 
tered white paper over them. Put all the trimmings of the salmon into a 
saucepan with carrots, onions, thyme, parsley, a bay-leaf, a few cloves, 
some whole pepper, salt to taste, and a little more than a pint of good 
stock. Leave this to boil gently till reduced one-half, then strain the

CUTLETS OF COD. 

The ingredients are three pounds of the fresh fish cut in slices of the 
thickness of three-quarters of an inch, and taken from the body of the 
fish; a handful of fine bread-crumbs, with which should be mixed pepper 
and salt, and a little minced parsley and an ^gg, beaten light. Enough 
dripping to fry the cutlets. 

Cut each slice of fish into strips, as wide as two fingers, dry them with 
a clean cloth, rub lightly with salt and pepper. Dip the slices in the egg, 
then the crumbs, and fry in enough fat to cover. Drain away every drop 
of fat, and lay the cutlets on a napkin on a hot dish. 

Mrs. C. Leone. 
FISH TURBOT. 

Cook a fish of about four pounds in salted water to which spices^ 
parsley, and celery have been added. Pour in a cup of vinegar. Then 
let the fish become cold and pick into small pieces, removing the bones 
and skin. Now make a dressing of a cup of milk, two large tablespoons 
of flour, one cup of sweet cream, pepper and salt. Cook ten minutes, then 
mix with fish, stewing a little parsley over mixture. Grease a pudding 
form with butter, then fill with the mixture. Cover the top with crackers 
rolled fine and browned in butter. Bake half an hour. 

Mrs. Casper. 
FISH TURBOT— No. 2. 

Take two cups of flaked fish, one cup rolled and sifted shredded wheat 
biscuit crumbs, four tablespoonfuls of butter, one cup of milk, pepper, and 
one-half of a teaspoonful of salt. Use cold boiled and baked fish that is 
left over. Butter a pudding dish, cover with crumbs, layer of fish, pepper, 
butter and sauce made from two tablespoonfuls of wheat flour, two of the 
level tablespoons of butter, salt and milk. Boil till it thickens. Proceed 
in this way until the dish is filled, finishing with crumbs, and dress with 
butter. Bake slowly forty minutes. E. M. B. 

FRIED EELS. 

Clean and cut the eels into pieces three Inches In length, cover them 
in a sauceoaa with cold water, in which salt, pepper, tnyme, onions ana 
^arrots sliced thin, and one-half of a glass of vinegar have been put. As 
soon as they boil take from the fire, and let them become cool. Then drain 
them and dry. Mix ^gg and bread-crumbs, beating the &gg first, and dip 
each piece in. Fry them brown in drippings. Place them on a dish, and 
have a tartar sauce ready to serve with them. Mrs. Mamie Frye.

BROILED EELS. 

Skin and clean a good-sized eel; remove the backbone and cut the 
eel into five or six pieces. Dip each piece into &gg and then into bread- 
crumbs which have been salted and peppered. Put on a greased gridiron 
with the skin downward, over a clear fire, and broil, turning over when 
done on one side. Put on a hot dish, garnish with parsley and serve with 
tartar sauce. E. H. Dougherty. 

STEWED EELS. 

This is a favorite dish with many. Clean and skin three pounds of

pan containing the melted butter. Strew the onion and parsley over all, 
cover the saucepan closely, and set in a pot of cold water. Bring this 
gradually to a boil, then cook very gently for an hour and a half, or until 
they are tender. Turn out into a deep dish, Mary Floyd. 

PICKED CODFISH. 

This is an old-fashioned dish and name, but with most persons a great 
favorite. Pick the fish in small particles, separating the fibers as near 
as possible, the finer the better. Freshen by leaving it in water one hour. 
Pour off the water and cover again with fresh. Bring it to a scald, pour it 
off and pour over the fish just enough milk to cover it. Add to a quart 
of the soaked fish butter the size of one-half of an egg, a very little flour 
and a dust of pepper. Beat up two eggs, and after taking off the fish 
thicken it by stirring In the Qgg. Some let it boil after the &gg is added, 
but if this is done the e^gg will curdle. Another way is to boil eggs, chop 
and mix them in the gravy. Louise Harris. 

BAKED CODFISH AND POTATOES.

BOSTON FISH CHOWDER. 

Take a large fish, as cod, haddock or halibut and cut in slices, after 
having scaled and cleaned it. Then cut some slices of raw salt pork 
(pickled) and place them in the bottom of your iron kettle. When partly 
tried out, put on top of the pork a layer of fish, then a layer of onions, and 
one of potatoes, both sliced quite thin. Add to each layer a little salt and 
pepper. Add very hard crackers (pilot bread is nicest) to the whole, 
placing them on the sides and top, then add cold water to nearly cover 
them. After the water has commenced boiling, three-quarters of an hour 
is ample time to cook it. Be careful not to let it boil too long, or break 
the slices of fish, but preserve them as whole as possible. 

Mrs. Lydia Floyd. 
FISH BALLS. 

The remnants of any cold fish, cod, whitefish, turbot, etc., can be 
used, by breaking the fish to pieces with a fork, removing all the bones

HOW TO CURE AND SMOKE FISH. 

Scale, slit the fish up the back and clean. Wipe with a damp cloth 
but do not wash. To twenty pounds of fish allow one pint of salt, one 
pint of brown sugar and one ounce of salt-peter. Mix well together and 
rub the fish well inside and out with this mixture. Put one fish over the 
other with a board on top, and on this place heavy weights to press them 
down. Allow them to remain so for sixty hours, then drain, wipe dry, 
stretch open and fasten with small pieces of stick. Smoke them for five 
days in a smokehouse or in a barrel over a smothered wood fire.

HOW TO COOK THEM. 

THE principal shell fish used are oysters, 
lobsters and mussels. It is absolutely t-» ^ 

imperative that oysters should be fresh and *^ 
the best way to insure this, is to purchase 

them when possible in the shell and open them as you use them. Oysters 
are among the most edible of their species, and when fresh, are delicious 
articles of food, besides being held by some medical men as nutritious for 
delicate and consumptive persons. There is an old maxim that they are 
to be used only during the months which contain the letter "r." Wash 
each oyster when eaten raw, by dipping it into cold water. The juice 
should go through a fine sieve, which removes all shell and prevents any^ 
being found in the dishes. Lobsters are in season from March 
November. They are eaten 
at other seasons but their 
meat is light and stringy. 
If used at other seasons it 
is best to get the canned 
lobster. Lobsters must be 
boiled alive else they are 
unwholesome. The larger 
they are the older they are. 
Mussels are not so general- 
ly liked, although growing 
in favor. They, too, must 
be eaten only during the 
months containing the let- 
ter "r." 




83 SHELL FISH, 

PHILADELPHIA BROILED OYSTERS. 

Take large oysters and strain through a colander, put juice on fire 
until it comes to a boil, then skim; melt some butter and brown it, then 
thicken with flour and brown together, then add the juice with a little 
water, to make sufficient gravy to soak the toast; wipe the oysters dry and 
broil on a broiler; mix with gravy and spread over the toast. 

Mrs. L. Brown. 

MOTHER'S RECIPE FOR FRYING OYSTERS. 

Put plenty of butter in a frying-pan and let it get real hot before you 
begin frying. Beat up well as many eggs as you judge you will need; dip 
the oysters therein, one by one, then roll them very lightly in cracker 
crumbs, then drop them in the hot butter. They will brown nicely before 
the oysters cook too much. Letitia Buzley. 

FRIED OYSTERS— No. 2. 

Select fine, large oysters, dry them out of their own liquor. Have 
ready a plate of eggs and a plate of bread-crumbs. Lay them in the egg 
a few minutes, and then roll them in the bread-crumbs, allowing them to 
remain in these also, for a minute or two; this will make them adhere, 
and not come off as a skin, when in the pan. Fry in half butter and half 
lard, in order to give them a rich brown. Make it very hot before putting 
the oysters in. Mrs. R. Hathaway. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Roll out puff paste a quarter of an inch thick, cut it into squares, 
cover ten patty pans, and put on each a crust of bread the size of a 
walnut. Roll out another layer of paste the same thickness, cut as above, 
wet edge of the bottom paste and put on top; pare them, so the edges 
will be even, notch them with the back of the knife, rub them lightly with 
the yolk of an ^%%, and bake them in a hot oven about a quarter of an 
hour. When done slice very thin off the top, remove the bread and the 
inside paste. 

Filling. — Parboil two dozen oysters In their own liquor, after boiling it 
down to half, cut the oysters in halves, put them in a pan with an ounce of 
butter rolled in flour, half a gill of cream and a little salt. Stir this mix- 
ture over the fire five minutes, fill the patties, put the cover on, and serve 
hot. Mrs. George Bonham. 



SHELL FISH. 83 

FILLING FOR OYSTER PATTIES— No. 2. 

Mix well together two tablespoons of butter, two tablespoons of flour, 
then pour half a pint of oyster liquor and one-half a pint of cream into 
the butter and flour. Beat and add the yolics of two eggs. Warm the 
oysters in their own liquor, and add them to the mixture just before they 
are to be used in the patties. Mrs. L. Cleveland. 

STEAMED OYSTERS. 

Wash the oyster shells thoroughly with a brush, place them side by 
side in a steamer, close it well and put over a large pot of boiling water. 
The deep shell must be undermost in order that no juice may be wasted. 
As soon as the shells open, the oysters are done and should be served at 
once with pepper, salt, butter, and a thin slice of lemon with each oyster. 

Mrs. a. Anderson. 

ROAST OYSTERS IN THE SHELL. 

Prepare the oysters as for steaming, thfen roast them over a clear fire 
with the large shell down. Two minutes after the shells open, the oysters 
are done. Take up quickly and serve in the shells on a hot platter, with 
pepper, salt and butter to suit the individual taste. 

F. H. N. 
OYSTER CROQUETTES. 

Half a pint raw oysters, half a pint of cooked veal, one heaping table- 
spoonful of butter, three tablespoonfuls of cracker crumbs, the yolks of 
two eggs. Chop the oysters and veal very fine. Soak the crackers in 
oyster liquor, and then mix all the ingredients, and shape. Dip in egg 
and roll in cracker crumbs, and fry as usual. The butter should be soft- 
ened before mixing. F. E. P. 

OYSTER CHOWDER. 

Take one cupful of chopped fresh celery, one cup of milk, two table- 
spoons of butter, two tablespoons of flour, one salt-spoon of salt and the 
fleshy part of two and one-half dozen oysters cut in small pieces. Make a 
white sauce by cooking the flour and butter together and adding the milk 
gradually; then add the oysters, salt and cook five minutes; just before 
serving add the celery. Serve on thin slices of toast. W. T. M. 

OYSTER ROLLS. 

Very thin slices of baco.i are required, with the rind cut off. Pour 
two drops of essence of anchovy on each oyster, four drops of lemon, a 
very little cayenne pepper, and roll each oyster in a slice of bacon. 



84 SHELL FISH. 

When you have rolled enough, skewer them and fry them. Then, when 
done, take each roll separately and place it on a fired crouton. These 
rolls must be eaten very hot. Mrs. Carrie Oliver. 

SCALLOPED OYSTERS. 

Take a dish, put a layer of the oysters as free from their liquor as they 
can be made, and a layer of rolled crackers; another layer of oysters, 
another of crackers, until the dish is full. Add a little salt and pepper 
and pieces of butter between each layer, and moisten with cream. Bake 
about fifteen minutes. Mrs. Clarissa McB. 

OYSTER PANCAKES. 

Chop one pint of oysters — canned ones do very well — and add enough 
milk to the liquor to make a pint, using a little cream. Make a batter by 
stirring it into a scant pint of flour, adding a pinch of salt and two eggs 
very well beaten. If half a teaspoonful of baking powder is sifted with 
the flour, you are sure to have pancakes light, but some cooks prefer to 
depend on the eggs. When the batter is perfectly smooth beat in the 
oysters and bake on a griddle, like any pancakes. Try one, and if too 
substantial add a little more milk. If you like them richer, add a table- 
spoonful of melted butter. Serve with toasted crackers.

Canned corn may be used instead, if desired. E. E. A. 

STEWED TERRAPIN. 

(Maryland Style.) 

Note. — Terrapin are much esteemed, and those which command the 
highest price come from the Chesapeake Bay region. They are also found 
in most of the seas of warm climates. The kind most in demand is the 
"diamond-back," or salt-water terrapin, and is never found far from the 
seacoast. Rarely does their length exceed ten inches, and their weight 
about eight pounds. The female is the largest, and its flesh most prized. 
When they are large they are called "counts." They feed on both animal 
and vegetable food. 

The ordinary way of killing them is to plunge them into boiling 
water, head first, and boil them fifteen minutes. We cannot wonder that 
vegetarians revolt against the cruelties practiced toward the animals that 
furnish us with food. 

Cut up one terrapin, put in a saucepan with a glass of Madeira, a little 
salt^ and pepper, and one ounce of butter. Beat a teacup of cream with 
yolks of two eggs, hard boiled, and put it in with the terrapin moving it 
around in the pan, but not letting it boil. Use a soup turpeen to hold it 
when done. Mrs. Claude Morey.

TERRAPIN STBAK. 

Take a terrapin, cut steaks from it, and sprinkle them with salt and 
pepper. Put a few lumps of butter on them and broil on a gridiron. 
Serve the steak very hot. Mrs. W. H. Palmer. 

DIAMOND-BACK OR SALT-WATER TERRAPIN. 

The diamond-back turtle is highly prized for food. Select a thick, 
fat terrapin, and plunge it head first into a kettle of boiling water. Throw 
in some salt, put the cover on, and let cook for fifteen minutes. Take 
out, remove the black skin from the shell, and the nails from the claws. 
Wash the terrapin thoroughly in warm water, and remove the shells. 
Take out the dark green gall bladder, which is about the size of a cherry, 
the sand bag, entrail and remove the head. Preserve the eggs, if there 
be any. All the pieces of meat, together with the fat and legs, should be 
kept in water until wanted for use. W. J. P. 

STBWED TERRAPIN WITH CREAM. 

Take some of the flesh prepared as above, cut in little pieces, and put 
over the fire in a stew-pan, together with a seasoning of pepper and salt, 
and a small piece of butter. Let stew for a short time, add one cup of 
hot water and an extra piece of butter; stew for ten minutes, then add 
two cups of rich milk and let it stew for another five minutes; then remove 
the pan to the side of the fire, and stir in a little thickening. Cover the 
pan and let stand for five minutes. Pour the terrapins, sauce and all, over 
hot tea-biscuits or buttered toast. E. J. C. 

BOILED LOBSTER. 

Taka a live lobster, wash thoroughly and put into a kettle of boiling 

water, sliglitly salted, having first cleaned and tied the claws together. 

Keep the water boiling for half an hour. When done take out, lay on its 

claws to drain, and wipe dry. Rub the shell with a little salad-oil, which 

will give it a clear red color. Do not boil a lobster too lon<^ or the meat 

will be stringy. The Germans put a handful of caraway seeds into the 

salt and water. If not sufficiently boiled, the spawn will not be brightly 

colored. S. F. E. 

LOBSTER. 

(Newport Style.) 

Split two cooked lobsters in half, remove all the meat, and divide the 
shells into eight parts Cut the meat fine, crack the claws, taking care 
not to destroy their shape, pick out the meat. Melt two tablespoonfuls

of butter, add one heaping tablespoonful of flour, stir and cook two min- 
utes; add one and one-half cupfuls of milk, stir and cook to a thick, 
smooth sauce; season with one teaspoonful of salt, one-quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of pepper; mix the yolks of two eggs with one-half a gill of cream, 
add them to the sauce, cook a few minutes, next add the lobster and one 
teaspoonful parsley chopped fine, stir two minutes over the fire. Fill 
this preparation in the lobster shells, sprinkle one teaspoonful grated 
bread-crumbs over each one and a few drops of melted butter. Place the 
shells in a shallow pan and bake ten minutes in a hot oven. 

How TO Arrange. — Cut a piece of bread oblong and toast, fasten 
this in the center of an oblong dish, and cover with parsley butter (butter 
mixed with parsley chopped fine), fasten the lobster claws with small 
skewers in the center on top of the bread, dress the lobster around, it 
garnish with small sprigs of parsley, and serve. Mrs. L. A. B.

shells again, sprinkle thickly with bread-crumbs, and brown in the oven 
very slowly. A. M. D. 

LOBSTER SAUSAGES. 

Pick the flesh from a medium-sized freshly-boiled lobster. Mince 
fine and pound it in a mortar with two ounces of fresh butter, a little 
salt, cayenne, and pounded mace, and half of the coral, which has been 
pounded separately, and pressed through a hair sieve with the back of a 
spoon. Shape the mixture into rolls like sausages, sprinkle the rest of 
the coral over them, and place them in oven with a moderate fire until 
they are quite hot. Serve them on a folded napkin, and garnish with let- 
tuce leaves. Mrs. Clara Bristow. 

COLD LOBSTER.

tail and claws arranged neatly round it. Garnish with parsley. Salt, 
cayenne, mustard, salad-oil, and vinegar should be eaten with it. 

Mrs. H. Brown. 
BOILED nUSSELS. 

Brush the shells and wash the mussels in several waters, so they will 
be free from grit. Put them into a deep saucepan (without water) and 
sprinkle a little salt over them. Spread a napkin over them in the sauce- 
pan, put the lid on, and scald them over a sharp fire. Shake them about 
briskly, to keep them from burning. When the shells open, take the 
saucepan off the fire, strain the liquor into a bowl, and take out the fish. 
Very carefully remove the little piece of weed which is found under the 
black tongue and throw it away. If the mussels are left too long on the 
fire they will become leathery Mrs. Croly. 

BROILED SOFT-SHELL CI^ABS. 

Thoroughly clean the desired number of soft-shelled crabs, dip them 
into melted butter and season with pepper and salt. Then put them en

Pick the meat from the shell and claws of a freshly-boiled crab. 
Pound it in a mortar with salt, cayenne, and pounded mace. Press it into 
small jars, cover it with butter, and bake it in a moderate oven for half an 
hour. When cold, pour freshly-clarified butter over it. Set it aside until 
the butter becomes cold. G.R.B. 



SHELL FISH. 91 

DEVILED CRABS. 

Boil the crab and extract the meat therefrom, season with cayenne 
pepper, mustard, salt and such table sauce as you may prefer; put into a 
covered saucepan with hot water sufficient to keep from burning; add 
cracker dust moistened with a tablespoonful of cream together with a 
quantity of butter. Serve in the back shell, putting a sprig of parsley 
with each. ' H. J. F. 

CRAB FARCIE. 

Take all the meat from the shells, and weigh with bread-crumbs, 
allowing a pound of the meat to a pound and one-quarter of the crumbs. 
The crumbs must cover the meat. Put pieces of butter over the whole, 
and bake in the oven ten minutes. Serve with lemon and parsley, 
chopped. Mrs. Felice LaMonte. 

SCALLOPS. 

This fish much resembles an oyster, though it is larger, and tastes 
like a crab. Dry them after washing, and trimming away the beard and 
black parts, then roll in cracker dust, afterward in Qgg and crumbs, and 
drop them into boiling fat for a minute, so they will take on a light brown. 
The crumbs must have salt and pepper mixed with them. 

Mrs. Callahan.

dish of finely-chopped cabbage with fresh dressing. W. O. T. 

STEAMED CLAMS. 

(New England Style.) 

Scrub the required number of clams, place when clean in a saucepan 
over the fire without any water and heat until the shells open. Take out 
the clams and pour the liquor into a jar to settle. Remove the clams 
from their shells, pulling off the thin skin round the edge, and cutting 
off the black end with a pair of scissors. When the water has settled 
pour it into a saucepan, add the clams and heat but do not boil. Take out 
the clams and serve on brown bread. H. T. P.

POM 








Y THE word game is meant all animals and birds which live in the 
woods and fields in a state of nature, which have never been domes- 
ticated and are proper to be eaten. There are many sorts of game — from 
the little quail, prairie chicken, and kindred birds, to the roe, deer and 
other hoof-footed species. The flesh of wild fowl has an aroma more 
marked than that of the tame ones. 

HOW TO SELECT POULTRY. 

Poultry may be served in many fashions, and is generally eaten with 
pleasure. In selecting it full-grown fowls have the best flavor, provided 
they are young. The age can be determined by turning the wing back- 
ward — if it yields, it is tender. The same is true if the skin on the leg is 
readily broken. Older poultry makes the best soup. In dressing poultry, 
chickens only should be scalded. All other fowl and game are best dry- 
picked. The intestines should be removed at once, but frequently in ship- 
ping they are left in and, hence, when removed, the fowl needs washing 
in several waters. The next to the last water should contain a half tea- 
spoonful of baking soda, which sweetens and renders all more wholesome. 
The giblets are the gizzard, heart, liver and neck. 

The best pan in which to bake all kinds of game and fowl is a double 
pan or one with a hinged cover. The latter has been put upon the mar- 
ket within a few years and contains a small aperture in the top which per- 
mits the steam and gas to escape when wished, but confines the aroma 
which is absorbed by the meat. gg 



;)G POULTRY AND GAME. 

SAGE DRESSING. 

A good sage dressing for geese or ducks is obtained by mixing one 
pint of stale bread-crumbs, two tablespoons of melted butter, one table- 
spoon of chopped parsley, one teaspoon of salt, two teaspoons of powdered 
sage, one teaspoon of powdered sweet marjoram, one-quarter of a teaspoon 
of black pepper. Mix all together, and moisten by adding the butter. 
This can be served on a separate dish, as a dressing for pork when 
roasted. Mrs. Jane Hart. 

FORCEMENT BALLS. 

These may be made by chopping one-quarter of a pound of beef suet, 
together with a little lemon peel, and some parsley. Mix with a bowl of 
bread-crumbs, flavored with pepper, salt and nutmeg. The yolks of two 
eggs will moisten it, when it must be rolled in flour, and made up into 
small balls and baked in a hot oven till crisp. These balls are fine to 
stuff fowls with. A little ham chopped or pounded makes them richer. 

Mrs. Margaret Anderson. 

STUFFING FOR GOOSE OR TAME DUCK. 

Mash potatoes finely, season highly with minced onion, sage, salt and 
pepper. Never fill a fowl more than two-thirds. Apples can be substi- 
tuted for the potatoes. G. W. P. 

ROAST TURKEY WITH OYSTER DRESSING. 

Dress the turkey carefully and rub thoroughly inside and out with 
salt and pepper. Stuff with a dressing prepared as follows: Take a loaf 
of stale bread, cut off crust and soften by placing in a pan, pouring on 
warm water, never boiling, squeezing out with the hand all the water, 
add one-half a pound of melted butter and a teaspoonful of salt and one- 
half a teaspoonful of pepper; drain off liquor from a quart of oysters, 
bring to a boil, skim and pour over the bread-crumbs; mix all thoroughly 
and if dry, moisten with a little sweet milk; lastly, add the oysters, being 
careful not to break them. Sew up the openings, spread the turkey over 
with butter, salt and pepper, place in a dripping-pan in a well-heated oven, 
add half a pint of hot water, and roast, basting often. Turn until nicely 
browned on all sides, and about one-half an hour before it is done, baste 
with butter and dredge with a little flour — this gives a frothy appearance. 

When making the gravy if there is much fat in the pan, pour off most 
of it and add the chopped giblets previously boiled until tender, and the 
liquor in which they were cooked, place one heaping tablespoon of flour 



POULTRY AND GAME, 97 

in a pint bowl, mix smooth with a Httle cream; fill up bowl with rich milk, 
and add to the gravy in the pan; boil several minutes, stirring constantly 
and pour into the sauce-bowl. Serve with cranberry sauce. Chef. 



CHESTNUT DRESSING. 

Shell a quart and one-half of chestnuts. Put them in hot water and 
boil until the skins are soft, then drain the water and remove the skins. 
Replace the chestnuts in water, and boil until soft. Take out a few at a 
time, and press through a colander while hot. Season the mashed chest- 
nuts with two tablespoonfuls of butter, two teaspoonfuls of salt, and one- 
quarter of a teaspoonful of pepper. W. P. B. 



PLAIN ROAST TURKEY. 

Pluck the bird carefully and singe off the down with lighted paper; 
break the leg bone close to the foot, hang up the bird and draw out the 
strings from the thigh. Never cut the breast; make a small slit down the 
back of the neck and take out the crop that way, then cut the neck-bone 
close, and after the bird is stuffed the skin can be turned over the back 
and the crop will look full and round. Cut around the vent, making the 
opening as small as possible, and draw carefully, taking care that the gall 
bag and the intestine joining the gizzard are not broken. Open the 
gizzard, remove the contents and detach the liver from the gall bladder. 
The liver, gizzard and heart, if used in the gravy, will need to be boiled 
an hour and one-half, and chopped as fine as possible. Wash the turkey 
and wipe thoroughly dry, inside and out; then fill the inside with stuffing, 
and either sew the skin of the neck over the back or fasten it with a small 
skewer. Sew up the opening at the vent, then run a long skewer into the 
pinion and thigh through the body, passing it through the opposite pinion 
and thigh. Put a skewer in the small part of the leg, close on the out- 
side and push it through. Pass a string over the points of the skewers 
and tie it securely at the back. 

Dredge well with flour, and cover the breast with nicely-buttered 
white paper, place on a grating in the dripping-pan and put in the oven to 
roast. Baste every fifteen minutes — a few times with butter and water, 
and then with the gravy in the dripping-pan Do not have too hot an 
oven. A turkey weighing ten pounds will require three hours to bake. 

Mrs. a. C. Brown,

BOILED TURKEY WITH OYSTER SAUCE. 

Prepare in the same manner as for roasting, fill with a dressing of 
oysters. Tie legs and wings close to the body, place it in boiling water 
that has been well salted, with the breast down. Skim it often, and boil 
two hours, but not long enough to have the skin break. Serve with celery 
or oyster sauce. Have a nice piece of salt pork, or ham, boiled, and serve 
a thin piece to each plate. j| 

Some save the liquor in which the turkey has been boiled and use it 
for soup, by adding seasonings. Mrs. Marietta Hollister. 

ROASTED TURKEY WITH SAUSAGES. 

(German Style.) 

Stuff the turkey with rich dressing, when done remove to platter, sur- 
round with small, fried sausages and chestnuts cooked in broth. Put 
a handful of water cress at each end of the platter, and serve with a well- 
thickened giblet sauce. Matie Higbie. 

BRAISED TURKEY. 

Truss and stuff as for roasting, using a forcemeat made of minced 
chicken, mushrooms and sweetbreads, in addition to the bread; lard the 
breast with fine square shreds of fat salt pork; place the turkey in a stew- 
pan, breast uppermost, with sliced vegetables and sufficient broth to cover. 
Set it on top of the stove, and as soon as it begins to simmer put into the 
oven and cook slowly for an hour and one-half. Baste occasionally with 
the gravy. Garnish the turkey with stoned olives and thicken the gravy. 

Mrs. Jane Hall. 
BONED TURKEY. 

This is a difficult thing to attempt, but very nice when accomplished. 
Clean the fowl, as usual. Have a very sharp-pointed knife, begin at end 
of wing, pass the knife down close to the bone, cut all the flesh from the 
bone, leaving the skin whole. Pass the knife down each side of the breast 
bone and up the legs, keeping close to the bone. Split the back half way 
up, and carefully draw out the bones. Fill the places whence the bones are 
removed, with a stuffing restoring the fowl to its natural form, and sew up 
all the incisions made in the skin. Lay a few strips of fat bacon on the 
top, basting often with salt and water, and a Rttle butter. A glass of 
port wine added to the gravy is liked by some. 

When serving carve across the fowl in slices, and add tomato sauce.

PHEASANT. 

Prepare as you would any game; lard, rub with salt, wrap in grape- 
vine leaves and roast from an hour to an hour and a half in plenty of 
butter to keep them juicy and tender. The pheasant is one of the greatest 
dainties of the table. Malendy. 

JELLIED GOOSE. 
(German Style.) 

One young (not too fat) goose, two well-cleaned disjointed calves' 
feet, two heaping teaspoons white pepper-corns, same amount of allspice, 
several large onions, four bay-leaves, one carrot, one parsley root, part of 
a celery root, rind and juice of one lemon, salt, enough white-wine vinegar 
to give it a sour taste, almond oil. 

Take the whole goose, head, neck, heart, lungs, gizzard and feet 
(scald and skin the feet), together with the calves' feet, put in a granite 
pot, cover with water and boil, carefully skimming it until it looks clear, 
then add the spices, vegetables, lemon and the vinegar, boil until the meat 
is well done, remove the fat as it rises and strain boiling hot through a 
flannel (white) bag to cool. (It must taste piquant and spicy.) After the 
meat has cooled separate the meat from the breast bone, cut it in narrow, 
bias strips, cut the legs in the joints, likewise the rest of the goose, add 
the head, neck, feet, etc., put all together in a porcelain dish, well oiled 
with almond oil or greased with lard. Now free the jelly of every par- 
ticle of fat, remove all that is clear, melt it and pour gradually over the 
meat. Do not turn it out until ready to serve. It must be stiff enough to 
keep the shape of the form, but not hard and sticky. 

Mrs. Etta Hover. 
ROAST GOOSE. 

Do not cook a goose that is more than eight months old, and the fat- 
ter it is the more juicy the meat. The dressing should be made of three 
pints of bread-crumbs, six ounces of butter, a teaspoonful each of sage, 
black pepper and salt, and an onion chopped fine. Do not stuff very full, 
but stitch very closely so that the fat will not get in. Place in a baking 
pan with a little water, and baste often with a little salt, water and vine- 
gar. Turn the fowl frequently, so that it may be evenly browned. Bake 
two and one-half hours. When done, take it from the pan, drain off the 
fat and add the chopped giblets which have previously been boiled ten- 
der, together with the water in which they were done. Thicken with 
flour and butter rubbed together; let boil, and serve.

BAKED CHICKEN. 

Take a plump fowl, dress and lay In cold salt water for one-half hour, 
then put in pan, stuff and sprinkle well with salt and pepper; lay a few 
slices of fat pork on to keep moist. Cover and bake until tender with a 
steady fire. Baste often. Turn so as to have uniform heat. 

Mrs. a. E. Reagor. 

STEWED CHICKEN WITH SALT PORK. 

One chicken and a little salt pork. Prepare chicken, the same as foi 
fried chicken, cut in pieces and put on the fire in a kettle with cold water 
enough to cover well, add the salt pork and boil until tender. When this 
is done have ready some baking-powder biscuits. Break open the bis- 
cuits, place on a platter, on these put the chicken; thicken the gravy with 
the flour, add seasoning and cream; pour this over the chicken and serve 
at once. Lola Baker. 

TO ROAST OLD FOWL. 

Neatly dress and then soak in cold water for two hours. Boil until 
tender, then put into roaster and stuff with a nice sage dressing. Take 
two tablespoonfuls of flour mixed with butter and spread over chicken. 
Put in oven and bake until a nice brown. Mrs. Mella Swift. 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Take a fat hen, dress and cut into pieces. Stew until tender, adding 
salt. Make a crust of two cups of sour cream, one-half a teaspoonful of 
soda, a pinch of salt, one cup of butter and one teaspoonful of baking 
powder. Add enough flour to make a stiff dough. Put chicken into a deep 
pan with plenty of broth. Sprinkle in a handful of flour and add pepper 
and more salt if necessary. Wet the edge of pan and cover the top with 
dough three-quarters of an inch thick, cutting a slit in the center for 
steam to escape. Bake in a moderately hot oven thirty minutes. 

Mrs. Chas. Horner. 
CHICKEN PIE— No. 2. 

Put a good fat young hen to cook in cold water. When partly done, 
salt. When done, remove bones and lay in the bottom of a baking dish. 
Prepare a sauce of three tablespoonfuls of butter (melted), three table- 
spoonfuls of flour, a little pepper and six cups of the warm chicken broth 
and one cup of warm milk or cream. Pour over the chicken. Crust. — 
Two cups of flour, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one teaspoonful of 



FOULTRY AND GAME. 101 

salt, two tablespoonfuls of butter or lard and one cup of milk. Mix well. 
Lay or drop over the chicken not (roll). An &gg may be added to the 
crust if desired. Excellent. Mrs. Lottie Alexander. 

POTTED CHICKEN. 

To every pound cold roast or boiled chicken allow one-quarter of a 
pound of butter, salt and cayenne to taste, one teaspoonful of pounded 
mace, one-half of a small nutmeg. Cut in small pieces, pound together 
till reduced to a small paste. Pack closely in jelly glasses, and cover 
with clarified butter. A few slices of ham added is an improvement. 

Mrs. Casson. 
PRESSED CHICKEN. 

Select two chickens about one year old, clean, cut up well, and stew 
in just enough water to cover. When nearly cooked, season with salt and 
pepper. Stew down until the water is nearly all boiled out, and the meat 
drops easily from the bones. Remove the bones and gristle; chop the 
meat rather coarsely, then put back into the stew kettle with broth (first 
skimming off all fat), and let it heat again. Turn It into an oblong bread 
pan, drop in along center four hard-boiled eggs; place a weight on the top. 
This will turn out like jelly and may be sliced. The success depends upon 
not having too much water; and see to it that the chickens are not too 
young. G. W. P. 

CHICKEN WITH MUSHR00M5. 

Have ready one pound of cold roast chicken cut into dice-shape, and 
one-half of a pint of mushrooms, cut Into small bits. Cover the mush- 
rooms with hot water and cook for five minutes. Skim them out and lay 
on a hot dish. Add enough milk to the liquid to make a coffee-cupful. 
Thicken with a tablespoon of flour rubbed smooth with the same quantity 
of butter. Season with a salt-spoonful of salt and half as much white pep- 
per. Add the chicken and mushrooms, and cook three minutes, stirring 
constantly. Serve on a hot platter. Mrs. Jennie Merrill. 

CHICKEN. 

(Italian Style.) 

Boil a whole chicken till tender in lightly salted water. While cock- 
ing dip out into a granite kettle a pint of the broth and put with it 
one sliced onion, a tablespoon of butter, salt and pepper, and one-half 
of a cup of macaroni broken into tiny pieces. Cook till water has 
"nearly boiled away, then add one cup of milk and cook slowly till the 



102 POULTRY AND GAME. 

macaroni has absorbed the milk. Sprinkle grated cheese over it. Boil 
the chicken broth till reduced to one pint; thicken slightly. Pour the 
macaroni over the chicken and the thickened sauce over the whole; on 
top sprinkle a little grated cheese. Mrs. Del Nero. 

PICKLED CHICKEN. 

Boil four chickens till meat falls from bones. Put meat in a stone jar 
and pour over it three pints of good cold cider-vinegar and a pint and 
one-half of the water in which they were boiled. Add spices and let 
stand two days. This is a fine dish for luncheon, or for Sunday evening 
tea. Mary Bonner. 

ESCALLOPED CHICKEN. 

To a pint of boiling hot cream add one tablespoon of flour, mix until 
smooth; season with pepper and salt; scatter a few bread-crumbs in 
dish, then a layer of seasoned chicken cut as for salad, then a layer of 
cream dressing; put two layers each, then bread-crumbs and small 
pieces of butter on top. Mrs. Minnie Amphlett. 

CREAMED CHICKEN. 

Sec Chapter on "Chafing Dishes." 

CHICKEN QULASH. 

(Delicious.) 

This is a Hungarian dish. I first tasted of it in Budapest but the first 

mouthful convinced me it was one of the nicest ways of serving chicken I 

ever knew. Boil the fowl in the usual way. When tender take out, 

remove the bones and put bones back into the liquor; cook thirty minutes 

and remove bones. Cut chicken in small bits or cubes (except the liver, 

heart and gizzard — reserve these for other uses). Put chicken in liquor, 

add one-half can of tomatoes or six whole ones, six onions, salt, pepper, 

speck of sugar, and butter, and stew until done. Have ready one dozen 

slices of buttered toast. Pour over toast in soup tureen. Serve hot. 

Irene S. 
CHICKEN FRIED. 

(New England Style.) 

A chicken for frying should be very young, but if there are doubts as 
to its age, before cutting it up parboil it for ten minutes in water that has 
been slightly salted. Then sprinkle a little salt and pepper over the 
pieces and roll them in flour. Fry them in plenty of butter till done. It 
takes about twenty minutes to fry them. Put the chicken on a platters 



POULTRY AND GAME. 103 

make a gravy by turning off some of the fat and adding a cup of milk that 
has been thickened with a tablespoon of flour. Pour this gravy over it. 
Or the gravy can be omitted and the platter can be garnished with crisp 
lettuce leaves. Mrs. Fanny Oakley. 

STEWED CHICKEN. 

Melt in a stew-pan two tablespoonfuls of rather salt butter, and thicken 
by adding one of flour. Stir it well, to make it smooth, till it assumes a 
light yellow color. Put in a plump young chicken, cover it close, and let 
it simmer half an hour, turning it once. Then add a tumbler of rich beef 
jelly and one of sherry, and fill up the pan with mushrooms. Again close 
it and let it simmer another half hour, when it is ready to serve. Salt and 
pepper are the only spices needed. J. A. Goldberg. 

CHICKEN PATTIES. 

Mince fine cold chicken that has been roasted or boiled. Season with 
pepper and salt, and minced parsley and onion. Moisten with chicken 
gravy or cream; fill scalloped shells with the mixture. First, line the 
shells with pastry. Sprinkle grated cracker over the top of each pattie. 
Put a bit of butter on each; bake in a hot oven till brown. 

Amy Wilcox. 
BROILED CHICKEN ON TOAST. 

The finest way to prepare real young chicken is to dress and split 
them down the back. Remove the entrails, wash and wipe. Lay on 
granite pan in hot oven till thoroughly heated through, then put on broiler 
and place over live coals. Let thoroughly cook, turning often so as not 
burn. When done put in pan again, season with salt, pepper and butter 
and put in oven three minutes. Put small slices of buttered toast on plat- 
ter, put chicken on toast, add one-half cup of cream to pan, thicken a 
trifle, pour over chicken and serve. Mrs. L. M. 

CHICKEN CROQUETTES. 

Take any kind of cold fowl, cut up fine, season with salt, pepper and 
butter, a little onion if desired and stir in two fresh &ggz. Make in cakes, 
dip in beaten Qgg, then in cracker crumbs and fry in boiling lard or lard 
and butter mixed, or better, still, in Ko-nut. The latter is a vegetable oil 
perfectly healthy and fries a golden brown without easily burning.

MARYLAND FRIED CHICKEN WITH CORN D0DQER5. 

Clean and wipe a chicken and drop the pieces into boiling lard. Fry 
until well browned and thoroughly cooked. As the pieces are cooked 
remove to a hot platter. When all are done, pour off the lard, leaving in 
the pan the gravy of the chicken. Return the pan to the fire and pour in 
about one cup or more of cream. Dredge in a little flour; stir; bring it to 
a boil and let boil three minutes. Season with pepper and salt and poui* 
over the chicken. Sprinkle the top with some finely-chopped parsley. 
Have ready firm, cold corn-meal mush. Cut it into slices, dip them lightly 
in Qggy cover with flour, and fry in butter. Garnish the edge of the platter 
with these corn dodgers, and serve. Mrs. C. I. Tibbitts. 

CHICKEN STEW WITH BISCUIT. 

Boil the chicken same as for fricassee, take out the chicken and have 
ready a frying-pan with butter; into this put your chicken and let brown 
on both sides; after taking the chicken up on platter pour into your fry- 
ing-pan the gravy left in the kettle. Let come to a boil, thicken. Have 
ready some cream biscuits, break open on the platter, butter each half and 
pour over your gravy. J. T. P. 

CURRIED CHICKEN. 

Slice an onion and brown in a little butter, adding a spoonful of curry- 
powder. Let remain covered a few minutes to cook. Add more butter, 
and put in the cold chicken previously cut up very small. Thicken with 
a little flour. F. V. Varley. 

REED BIRDS. 

They need to be plucked and drawn very carefully, when they can be 
salted and flour dredged over them. They need a quick fire and about 
fifteen minutes roasting Raw oysters can be placed in each one before 
putting it in the oven. Roll the oysters in bread-crumbs. Rub butter 
over them and pepper. D. P. Mann 

SNOW BIRDS. 

Clean a dozen thoroughly. Put a couple of oysters in each, put them 
in a yellow-ware dish, add two ounces of boiled salt pork and three raw 
potatoes cut into slices. Add a pint of oyster juice, an ounce of butter, 
salt and pepper. Lay a crust over the dish, and bake in a moderate oven.

ROASTED GUINEA FOWL. 

(Delicious.) 

Unless young the guinea are apt to be tough, but even an old guinea 
can be made eatable by the care of a good cook and they are always high- 
flavored and savory. Clean, stuff and roast like duck or chicken and 
send to the table with currant jelly. Mrs. Helen Gay. 



ROAST PARTRIDGES. 

A simple method of roasting these birds is to pick them, draw them, 
and wash carefully. Then truss them, binding thin slices of smoked bacon 
around them. Roast fifteen minutes in a pretty hot oven. About seven 
minutes before needed for the table, remove the bacon, salt the partridges 
lightly, and brown them in the oven. When placed on the table a brown 
gravy must accompany them. Mrs. M. Marline. 



ROAST PARTRIDGES— No. 2. 

A German way of roasting these birds is to truss them as you would 
a chicken. Place a vine-leaf upon the breast of each, over this lay two 
or three thin slices of fat bacon, and fasten them securely with strong 
twine. Put the birds into a stew-pan, just large enough to hold them, with 
as much butter as will keep them well basted, and when they are browned 
on one side turn them to the other, until they are evenly colored all over. 
When done pour a cup of thick cream over and sprinkle bread-crumbs, 
browned in butter, upon them. Mrs. Freda M. 

QUAILS ON TOAST. 

Take five quails, but don't remove the legs, for you would lose all the 
taste of the game. Wipe them well; string them tight, so as to raise the 
breasts. Put a little butter on each, a little lemon juice, and inside each 
the quarter of a lemon without the peel. Then put a very thin slice of 
pork, about three inches square, round each quail, with two or three cuts 
in each slice, and string it tight. Let cook on a good fire, and when they 
are nearly well done, for white meat game must be well done, cut the 
string; dress nicely on toast and serve hot. Pour the juice on the quails 
after having taken the fat off, and put some slices of lemon around the 
dish, one for each quaiL Mrs. Hattie Bullard- 



106 POULTRY AND GAME.. 

QUAIL STEW. 

Cut two quails down the back, lengthwise, place them in a pan with 

some butter, and cook them. Have ready two large slices of toasted or fried 

bread, and lay the quails upon them. Add a little water to the liquor, 

thicken it and pour it over the birds, squeezing a little lemon juice over 

them. Mrs. Hattie Forbes. 

ROAST QUAIL. 

Draw the quails and truss them, fastening a piece of fat pork over the 

breast of each. Place them in a baking-pan with two tablespoonfuls of 

butter and four of boiling water. Roast them about fifteen or twenty 

minutes, basting them often. When done take off the bacon, and let 

them be placed on a platter, garnished with water cress. Pour a rich 

brown gravy around the birds, but not over them. 

Mrs. Marcia Hunting. 
ROAST QUAII No. 2. 

Rinse well and steam over boiling water until tender, then dredge in 
flour and smother in butter. Season with salt and pepper, and roast in 
oven. Thicken the gravy. Serve with green-grape jelly, and garnish 
with parsley. Miss Caroline Elliott. 

ROAST PIGEONS. 

Clean and truss two young pigeons, mince the livers, and mix with 
them two ounces of finely-grated bread-crumbs, two ounces of fresh Gut- 
ter, an onion finely minced, a teaspoonful of shredded parsley, and a little 
salt, pepper, and grated nutmeg. Fill the birds with this forcemeat, 
fasten a slice of fat bacon over the breast of each, and roast. Make a sauce 
by mixing a little water with the gravy which drops from the birds, and 
boiling it with a little thickening; season it with pepper, salt, and chopped 

parsley. Mrs. Emma Legg. 

MOCK DUCK. 

Take a round steak, make a stuffing as if for chicken, put it in the 
steak, roll and skewer tightly. Sprinkle with a little flour, put in a pan, 
put bits of butter on it, pour water over it and bake. 

Mrs. Charlotte Baldwin. 

TO ROAST ANY SMALL BIRDS. 

Birds, forcemeat or oysters, bacon, one pint of rich stock, or one tea- 
spoonful meat extract dissolved in hot water, butter, pepper, salt, biscuit 
crust. 

Stuff the birds with any forcemeat, or put one large oyster in each

bird, place the bacon in an earthenware dish, upon this the birds. If a 
forcemeat is used add the stock; if oysters, the oyster liquor. Add butter, 
pepper and salt. M. V. H. 

ROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON. 

The flavor of venison is improved by being kept as long as possible 
and yet remaining perfectly sweet. Choose a haunch with clear, bright 
and thick fat. Wash it in warm water and dry well with a cloth; butter a 
sheet of white paper and put over the fat; lay the venison in a deep bak- 
ing dish with a \^xy little boiling water, and cover with a coarse paste of 
flour and water one-half inch thick. A thickness of coarse paper should 
be laid over the paste. Cook in a moderately-hot oven for four hours or 
less, according to the size of the haunch. Twenty minutes before it is 
done, quicken the fire, remove the paste and paper, dredge the joint with 
flour, and baste well with butter until it is nicely frothed and of a fine 
delicate brown color. Garnish the knuckle-bone with a frill of white 
paper, and serve with a gravy made from its own dripping — from which 
the fat has been removed — placed in a tureen. Currant jelly always accom- 
panies venison. Mrs. Serena Hall. 

VENISON STEAK BROILED. 

Take the leg and cut slices from it having a quick, clear fire. Turn 
them continually. They should be served under-done. Butter both sides 
of the steak; sprinkle salt and pepper over the venison, garnish with 
parsley and accompany it by a jelly sauce. 

Mrs. Dorcas Cummings. 
ROAST VENISON. 

Slit the venison and lard it with pieces of pork or bacon. Place pieces 
of pork or bacon on the bottom of the pan; slice very fine, vegetables on 
the pork, then place your meat on this. Season, brown well on the top 
of the stove, then turn over and brown on the other side; then set in the 
oven and put soup stock or water in the bottom of the pan and cover 
closely. Serve with gravy. The vegetables may be chopped fine and 
served with it, or not. Be careful not to let them burn. Baste with port 
wine. O. B. M. 

GAME PIE. 
(Fine.) 

Take two dozen woodcock, quail, snipe, or other small birds. Split 
each one in half and put them into a saucepan containing about a gallon 
of cold water, although beef broth or soup stock would be preferable. 
When the boiling point has been reached, carefully skim and season with 



108 POULTRY AND GAME, 

a little pepper and salt with mace, ground cloves and one bay-leaf, adding 
half a pound of salt pork cut into squares, two small carrots and one onioUc 
Boil until tender, being careful that there is enough broth to cover the 
game. Into another saucepan put four ounces of butter and two table- 
spoonfuls of browned flour, mixing well and stirring into it a part of the 
broth or gravy so as to make a thin sauce. Strain off what broth remains 
in the first saucepan, removing therefrom the vegetables and spices to go 
with the sauce. Slice and cut into dice-shape, potatoes equal in quantity 
to the meat, and put in a deep baking dish; put on the top crust of dough 
and bake in an oven that is not too hot. Mrs. Halliday. 

BAKED RABBITS WITH RICE. 

Cut a plump young rabbit into neat joints, and pepper highly. Dis- 
solve four ounces of bacon fat or good dripping in a saucepan, put in the 
rabbit, and let it steam over a gentle fire until lightly browned and half 
dressed. Take it up, drain, and put aside. Wash half a pound of rice, 
and put it into a saucepan with a quart of nicely-flavored stock and half a 
blade of mace. Let it simmer until it is tender and has absorbed the liquor, 
then let it cool, and stir in with it a large slice of fresh butter and the yolks 
of four eggs. Butter a deep dish, lay the pieces of rabbit into it, pour 
over them a large spoonful of chutnee, and then spread the rice on the 
top. Lay the beaten yolks of two eggs upon the rice, and bake the prepa- 
ration in a brisk oven. Mrs. J. Gay. 

HOW TO DRESS BELGIAN HARE. 

Take the hare by the hind feet, letting the head hang downward; 
strike a smart blow on the back of the head; cut the throat at once, let- 
ting out all the blood. Hang up. Run the knife around the first joint of 
the hind legs, cutting the skin, and pass the blade inside the thigh to the 
tail. With the hand separate the skin from the flesh, drawing the skin 
downward toward the head. Cut the fore legs off at the first joint and 
pull up the skin. Use the knife carefully in skinning the head, severing 
it at the nose and lip and drawing it off. Slit the belly lengthwise and 
remove intestines, excepting the kidneys. The liver and heart are to be 
saved; also the head if you wish it, first removing the eyeballs. Wash the 
body thoroughly and dry with a cloth. J. S. G. 

STEWED HARE» 

(Spanish Style.) 

Slice one large onion, one chili pepper, and four medium-sized

ROAST BELGIAN HARE. 

Prepare a stuffing by chopping fine one-quarter pound of salt 
pork and a small piece of onion. Pour boiling water over six Bos- 
ton crackers, then chop with the pork. Season with sage, salt and pep- 
per; add boiling water to moi: ten and stir in one ^^^. Wipe the hare 
dry, fill it with the stuffing and lard with small strips of salt pork. Allow 
twenty minutes for each pound. Put a piece of butter as large as an ^^% 
in a cup, fill with boiling water and use to baste. 

Miss Nettie Martin 

FRICASSEED HARE. 

Lay the pieces in cold water a little while, drain well and place in 
saucepan with pepper and thin slices of salt pork. Cover with water and 
let simmer for thirty minutes. Add chopped onion. Make a smooth flour 
paste, stir in and let simmer until the meat is tender, then add half a cup 
of cream. If too thin add more flour. Boil up once and serve hot. 

Mrs. J. M. Van Ness. 
RABBIT PIE. 

Cut a rabbit into eight pieces, soak in salted water one-half hour and 
stew until half done in enough water to cover it. Lay slices of pork in 
the bottom of a pie-dish and upon these a layer of the rabbit. Then fol- 
low slices of hard-boiled ^%^, peppered and buttered. Proceed until the 
dish is full, the top layer being bacon. Pour in the water in which the 
rabbit was stewed, and adding a little flour, cover with puff paste, cut a 
slit in the middle, and bake one hour, laying paper over the top should it 
brown too fast. Mrs. M. Mausley. 

ROAST DUCK— TAME. 

Take a young farm-yard duck fattened at liberty, but cleansed by 
being shut up two or three days and fed on barley-meal and water. Two 
small young ducks make a better dish than a large, handsome, hard- 
fleshed drake, which, as a rule, is best fit for a stew. Pluck, singe and 
empty; scald the feet, skin and twist round on the back of the bird; head, 
neck, and pinions must be cut off, the latter at the first joint, and all 
skewered firmly to give the breast a nice plump appearance. For stuffing, 
take one-half pound of onions, a teaspoonful of powdered sage, three 
tablespoonfuls of bread-crumbs, the liver of duck parboiled and minced 



110 POULTRY AND GAME. 

with pepper, salt, and cayenne. Cut the onions very fine, throw boiling 
water over them, and cover for ten minutes; drain through a gravy 
strainer, and add the bread-crumbs, minced liver, sage, pepper and 
salt to taste; mix, and put it inside the duck. This quantity is for one 
duck; more onion and sage may be added, but the above is a delicate 
compound not likely to disagree with the stomach. Let the duck be hung 
a day or two, according to the weather, to make the flesh tender- Roast 
before a brisk clear fire, baste often, and dredge with flour to make the 
bird look frothy. Serve with a good brown gravy in the dish, and apple 
sauce in a tureen. It takes about an hour. Mrs. E. Engel. 

DUCK AND GREEN PEAS. 

Cut the rind from half a pound of lean bacon. Divide it into pieces 
two inches square and fry a light brown with butter. Dredge in a little 
flour, and stir three minutes. Add a pint of broth, an onion stuck with 
two cloves, a bunch of sweet herbs, salt and pepper. The duck should be 
previously fried or roasted for ten minutes then put into the stew-pan with 
the gravy and stewed slowly for an hour and a quarter or till tender. 
Meanwhile stew a quart of peas with butter. Place the ducks and peas 
on a hot dish, pour over them the gravy strained and thickened, and serve 
hot. Mrs. A. Ament. 

BRAISED DUCK. 

Prepare the duck as if for roasting. Line a small pan just large 
enough for the duck, with slices of bacon. Strew over the bottom parsley, 
thyme, and lemon peel. Lay In the duck, add a carrot cut into strips, an 
onion stuck with three cloves, season with pepper, and cover with stock 
broth and a glass of white wine. Baste frequently, and simmer an hour, 
or till done. Fry some slices of turnip in butter to a light brown, drain 
and add them to the stew-pan, after removing the duck, which should be 
kept hot. When the turnips are tender remove them and strain the 
gravy, thickening with a little flour. Put the duck on a dish, throw the 
hot gravy over, and garnish with the turnips. Fry the turnips eight or 
ten minutes. Mrs. C. Clements. 

SQUIRREL. 

Squirrel Is cooked similar to rabbits. They may be broiled or made 
into a stew. There are many varieties — black, red, gray and fox. Gophers 
and chipmunks are also good but of smaller variety. J. M. B. 




HOW TO SELECT THEM. 



IN PURCHASING meat one should know how to select the best 
quality, and the most useful pieces. 

Beef, which stands at the head of the list, as being most generally 
used and liked, should be of a bright clear red, and the fat white. It 
should Ve well clothed in fat, to insure its being tender, and juicy. The 
finest pieces are the sirloin and the ribs — the latter making the best roast- 
ing pie<e in the animal. 

In booking steaks remember it is far better to turn over three or four 
times Oil a platter containing a little olive oil, than it is to hammer them, 
to make them tender. The object is not to force out the juice, but to 
softer the fiber. 

la selecting Pork, one cannot exercise too great care in examining it. 
Do not buy any that is clammy or has kernels in the fat. Remember, too, 
when the rind is hard it is old. 

Veal should be fine in grain, of a delicate pink with plenty of kidney 
fat. It should never be eaten under two months old. 

Mutton should be firm and juicy, the flesh close-grained, the fat hare 

and white. 

TIME REQUIRED TO ROAST MEATS. 

Ovens vary in heating qualities, some baking quicker than others, but 
fifteen minutes to the pound will do most roasts. The oven must be aV 
the proper heat when the meat is placed therein, so that the surface will 
crisp quickly, and the juices be retained in the meat. It is not necessary 
to wash the meat, but wipe it with a clean, damp cloth, and set it in the 
oven without any water. As soon as it begins to cook add a very little 
water, and baste it frequently. An onion may be laid on top of the roast, 
to give it a flavor, but should be removed before serving. 

Ill 



112 MEATS. 

HOW TO BOIL FRESH AND SALT HEAT. 

Fresh meat should be put at once into boiHng water, and when half 
done, the salt and vegetables should be added. Salt meats must be put 
into cold water in order to extract the salt. They require longer boiling 
than fresh meats, nearly thirty minutes to the pound. 

TO CLARIFY DRIPPINGS. 

Drippings accumulated from different cooked meats (except mutton, 
which has a strong flavor), can be clarified by putting all into a basin and 
slicing into it a raw potato, allowing it to boil long enough for the potato 
to brown, which causes all impurities to disappear. Remove from the 
fire, and when cool drain into basin and set in a cool place. 

Mabel Stanley. 

FOR PRESERVING BEEF FOR WINTER USE. 

See department on "Pickles, Vinegar and Brine." 

THAWING FROZEN JIEAT, ETC. 

If meat, poultry or fish is thawed by putting it into warm water or 
placing it before the fire, it will be rendered unfit to eat. The only way 
to thaw these things is by immersing them in cold water. If meat that 
has been frozen is to be boiled put it on in cold water. If to be roasted 
set it at a distance from the fire. It is best to thaw the night before cook- 
ing; lay it in cold water early in the evening and change the water at bed 
time. Sherman House, Chicago. 

TO KEEP HEAT FROM FLIES. 

Put in thick paper or muslin bags; if the latter, the meat should first 
be covered with straw. The sacking must be done early in the season 
before the fly appears. Muslin lets the air in and is better than paper. 

Perfection Market. 
TO TRY OUT LARD. 

Skin leaf lard, cut in small pieces, put it into an iron kettle, add one to 
two cupfuls of water to prevent sticking and burning. Let it melt slowly, 
being careful not to let it scorch; stir frequently from the bottom with a 
wooden flat ladle and let simmer until all the pieces have turned a golden 
brown, then throw in a little salt to settle it. Now set it back to cool and 
pour into jars. 

Nqte_ — The greatest care must be exercised while trying out lard to 
see to it that none runs over the pot, as that would prove disastrous. 



MEATS. 113 

Always warm the jars first, and put in a little lard at a time, to prevent 
their cracking. When cold and hard, tie up with clean, heavy paper, and 
keep in a cool, dry cellar. Mrs. J. T. Phillips. 

HOW TO BROIL MEATS. 

Broiling consists of placing the meat over clear, red coals, free from 
smoke. Do not have the fire too low or the gravy will drop upon the 
coals, nor too hot, else the meat will be blackened, and made hard. 

Never stick a fork into the lean part of a steak or chop in turning it, 
but put it in the outer fat. Have the dish hot on which the meat is to be 
placed, and season it after taking from the fire. E. R. M. 

ROAST BEEF. 

Have the butcher remove the bones of a rib-roast and roll the meat 
into a round shape; tie securely with a stout string; then, before sending 
it to the table, remove the string and insert one or two steel skewers. 
Before placing the meat to roast season with salt; then place it upon a 
grating in dripping-pan and put it in a very hot oven; baste frequently; if 
the meat is very fat you need no water in your pan; if not, pour a small 
cup of boiling water into the pan after it has been in the oven fifteen min- 
utes. Make a brown gravy. Mrs. Flora Thomas. 

BROILED STEAK. 

The only proper way to cook a beefsteak is to broil it on a light wire 
gridiron over a clear fire. When ready to turn, place it on a warm plate 
with a little butter, turning the cooked side down so that the juices may 
be saved in the plate, and not lost, as would be the case, were it turned 
upon the gridiron; return it to the gridiron as quickly as possible, and as 
soon as the other side is cooked place it again upon the plate, which be 
sure to have always warm; season with pepper and salt to taste, adding a 
little butter. There is a gridiron in the market (a double one), which per- 
mits the turning of the meat over the fire. It is so constructed that the 
juices are held in the pan. Mrs. E. R. Daniels. 

BEEFSTEAK AND ONIONS. 

This very popular dish necessitates the use of a frying-pan, upon 
which put the steak with a little suet, and add sliced onions which have 
previously been prepared by dropping into cold water; season with salt 
and pepper and cover tightly before putting upon the fire. A good way 
is to cook the steak and onions separate. Then smother the steak on the 
hot platter with the onions, W. P. B.

ROAST BEEF— No. 2. 

Select a loin or rib piece — the latter is the best — and pound it thor* 
oughly before placing in the pan; pour a cupful of boiling water over it 
and sprinkle a little salt; have the oven well heated and baste frequently 
with the drippings after the juices have cooked out. Cook about ten min- 
utes to a pound. When done it should be brown outside and a little red 
within. If the meat has an excess of fat cover the fatty portion with a 
flour and water paste, which can be removed before fully done. Turn the 
gravy upon the meat after skimming off the fat; season with pepper and 
salt. Any attempt at basting before the juices commence running from 
the meat will have the effect of toughening it. Sadie V. 

FILET OF BEEF LARDED. 

This is the tenderloin, although the sirloin is sometimes used. Trim 
off fat, tough skin, etc., and skewer into shape (round). Dredge well with 
salt, pepper and flour and put without water into a very small pan. Place 
in a hot oven thirty minutes; in lower part ten, and then on upper 
grate. Serve with mushroom sauce. The shape of the fillet is such that 
the time required for cooking is the same whether it weighs two or six 
pounds. Mrs. F. T. Griggs. 

CORNED BEEF. 

Should be cooked in plenty of cold water brought slowly to a boil; if 
very salt, the meat should be soaked over night; but if young and not too 
strongly brined this will not be necessary. It should be cooked sufficiently 
long to make tender, so that in a brisket or plate piece the bones may be 
readily removed. Preserve the liquor in the pot, and if any of the meat 
remains after the first meal, return it and let it stand over night in the 
liquor so that it may absorb it. If no meat remains to be returned to the 
liquor, the latter will make a good soup for next day's dinner if the beef 
was not too salt. M. J. M. 

BOILED BEEF WITH CABBAGE. 

(German Style.) 

Take one head of cabbage, and after removing all soiled and bruised 
leaves, cut in sections lengthwise, making about eight or nine pieces, leav- 
ing the piece of heart attached to each piece to hold it together. Place in 
the kettle on top of beef which has been boiling some time; let all boil 
together for one hour. Salt to taste and add a little pepper, if liked. 
Lift out the meat, let the cabbage boil a few moments longer in the beef 
broth and send it to the table in a vegetable dish. Mrs. O, T. Learned.

BEEFSTEAK AND ONIONS— No. 2. 

Broil or fry the steak. Cut up six onions in slices and fry them brown 
in drippings. Place the steak on the platter, cover it with the onions, and 
put it in the oven till thoroughly hot, and it is then ready for the table. 

Mrs. p. B. Murray. 

ROLLED STEAK. 

Take a good rump steak, flatten and lay upon it a seasoning made of 
bread-crumbs, parsley, pepper and salt, mixed with butter beaten to a cream 
with a fork. Roll up the steak, bind it evenly with fine twine, and lay it 
in a dish with a cup of boiling water. Cover with another dish and bake 
forty minutes, basting frequently. Remove the cover and let it brown 
before sending to table. Thicken the gravy with browned flour, and serve 
very hot. A layer of oysters, bearded, instead of the forcemeat is a 
pleasant change. The twine should be cut off before sending to table. 

Mrs. Priscilla Long, 

POT ROAST. 

Put a very little drippings in an iron kettle. When hot, lay the beef 
in. Add an onion chopped and fried till brown in butter; pour in water 
that has boiled, to half the height of the meat. Add salt and pepper, and 
cover as close as possible. Thicken the gravy. Simmer from two to 
three hours, according to weight. When done, take up, and pour the 
gravy over it, and send to the table. Mrs. Roeb. 

BEEF LOAF. 

Take two pounds of beef chopped fine and add eight large soda 
crackers rolled. Moisten with hot water, then add one-half a cup of 
sweet milk, one egg and a pinch of sage. Season with salt and pepper 
and mix thoroughly. Make into a loaf and place in a baking pan with 
two strips of bacon and a lump of butter; cook slowly an hour and one- 
half. Mrs. M. McDuffie. 

ROAST STEAK AND POTATOES. 

Butter a baking dish and sprinkle in a layer of chopped steak, season 
with salt and pepper. Put over this a layer of raw potatoes, peeled and 
sliced. Dust over a little flour, then sprinkle over another layer of steak, 
and so on until pan is full. Fill pan with hot water, cover and bake three 
hours. The flour used thickens the water and makes a delicious gravy. 

Mrs. C. F, G.

CURRIED STEAK. 

Slice two onions and one apple, and fry them in butter to a light 
brown. Cut a pound of steak into neat squares, mix a tablespoon each of 
curry-powder and flour, and salt to taste, together on a plate, rub each 
piece of meat into it, and fry quickly. Turn all into a saucepan with half 
a pint of water or gravy, which should be hot, and simmer gently for 
an hour; add lemon juice, and serve in a meat dish, with a border of 
boiled rice piled round. Mrs. Charlotte Rice. 

SPICED BEEF. 

Boil a shank of beef in as little water as will merely cover it. Cook 

till meat falls from the bone. Chop very fine, spice with ground cloves, 

pepper, salt and summer savory. Add sufficient of the liquor in which it 

was boiled to moisten well. Press into molds, and when cold slice.

CREAriED DRIED BEEF. 

(Fit for a Prince.) 

Pick in small pieces one-fourth of a pound of thinly-cut rather moist 
dried beef and brown in a little butter. When brown pour in it a coffee- 
cup of milk and cream. Let it come to a boil and slightly thicken with a 
little butter and flour creamed together. When it boils, pour it over a 
platter of golden brown toast and serve it at once. Mrs. M. 

BEEF PIE WITH POTATO CRU5T. 

When you have used the best of a cold roast of beef take the small 
pieces or as much as will half fill a granite baking pan; also any gravy 
that you have saved, a lump of butter, a bit of sliced onion, pepper and 
salt, and enough water to make plenty of gravy; put over a fire, thicken by 
dredging in a tablespoonful of flour; cover it up where it may stew gently. 
Now boil a sufficient quantity of potatoes to fill up your baking dish, mash 
smooth, and beat light with milk and butter and place in a thick layer 
on top of the meat. Brush it over with ^^%, pkce the dish in an oven, 
and let remain long enough to become brown. There should be a goodly 
quantity of gravy left with the beef, that the dish be not dry and tasteless

the gravy is absorbed; serve hot. * Mary, 

BOILED BEEF TONGUE. 

Clean three fresh tongues and place in a kettle with just enough water 
to cover and one cup of salt; add more water as it evaporates, so as to 
keep the tongues covered until done — when they can be easily pierced 
with a fork; take out and if to be served at once remove the skin. If 
wanted for future use, do not peel until needed. If salt tongues are used, 
soak over night and omit the salt when boiling. Mrs. A. R.

of cold water. Let it come to a boil, and if the beef is pretty salt pour off 
the water and add milk sufficient for a meal, a piece of butter and some 
pepper. Take cream, a full tablespoonful of flour, stir to a smooth paste, 
and add gradually to the beef, stirring till it thickens. It is a very nice 
breakfast dish. Mrs. Mary Hilton. 

BEEFSTEAK WITH DRESSING. 

It grows tiresome to always broil or fry beefsteak, so a pleasant 
change is to take a nice juicy round steak and make a dressing of grated 
bread, as if for a fowl. Cover the steak with this dressing, turn over the 
edges, and fasten with linen thread. Place it in a dripping-pan in which 
is one-half of an inch of water, and bake it. Turn it when one side is done 
and brown the other. Another way, which improves the flavor, is to lay 
the steak on the griddle in the dripping-pan, put plenty of salt, pepper 
and butter over it — do not spare the butter — and run it into the oven, 
turning it once, when one side is done, and basting the other side with 
the gravy. Mary Heaton= 

BREAKFAST DISH OF COLD STEAK. 

Put a spider over the fire and into it put two tablespoonfuls of butter.

first fill in with mashed potatoes to the brim; bake two hours in a slow 

oven, when the tin cover may be taken off, and the chops will be found 

tender and succulent. A. Plaisted. 

KIDNEY TORTILLA. 

Four eggs, two kidneys, one dessert spoonful of chopped parsley, 
one dessert-spoonful of chopped onion, one-half of a teacupful of stock, a

ROAST nUTTON. 

Get a leg of eight pounds, which has hung at least a week, weather 
allowing. During hot weather this joint gets quickly tainted. Rub it 
lightly with salt, and put it at once before a brisk sharp fire. Place it 
close to the fire for five minutes, then place it in the oven and let it roast 
slowly until done. Baste continually with good dripping until that from 
the joint begins to flow. When within twenty minutes of being done, 
dredge it with flour, and baste with butter or dripping; and when the 
froth rises serve on a hot dish. Make a gravy, throw off the fat, when 
any gravy, if the dripping pan has been floured, will adhere to it. Add a 
little stock and a little boiling water, pepper and salt. Pour the gravy 
round the meat, not over it. ' Anna Windom. 

nUTTON PIE. 

A very good family pie is made with the remains of a cold leg, loin, 
or any other joint of mutton from which nice neat slices of rather lean 
meat can be cut. These should be put with a good seasoning, in alter- 
nate layers with thinly-sliced potatoes, mto a pie-dish, commencing at the 
bottom with some of the meat, and finishing at the top with potatoes. 



122 MEATS, 

Parsley, savory herbs, onion, or shallot, with a little mace, white pepper 
and salt may be used at discretion. A cupful of good gravy from the 
meat should be poured into the pie before the crust is put on. Suet is 
generally used for the crust. Fannie Merklin. 

MUTTON PATTIES. 

Mutton patties are made with cooked meat, which is minced, then 
hashed in good gravy, seasoned with pepper, salt, and a little catsup. 
The mince should not boil, but be made hot, apd thickened. Patty pans, 
lined with half puff paste and filled with the meat, will require a very 
short time to bake. Cover with the paste, and put them into a quick oven 
for fifteen minutes. Mrs. Marian Bonnell. 

BREADED MUTTON. 

Sew the mutton up in a thin cloth, lay it in a saucepan, nearly cover 
it with cold water, and stew gently, allowing ten minutes to each pound. 
Take it out, unwrap and lay it in a baking-dish, brush over with warm 
dripping, dredge with flour, and set in the oven for one-half of an hour, 
basting freely with its own broth. A few minutes before taking it up 
strew thickly with crumbs, fine and dry, dot bits of butter over it, and 
brown. Serve garnished with slices of beetroot. 

Mrs. Alice Waters. 

RAGOUT OF MUTTON. 

Remove the bones from the mutton, so as to have three pounds of 
solid meat. Cut it in strips three inches long and one inch wide. Take 
two lamb sweetbreads, one cup of gravy, made from the bones, two eggs, 
one-quarter of a pound of salt pork, one onion, sliced and fried, one cup 
of green peas, pepper and salt, one tablespoonful of minced parsley, 
browned flour. After having fried the onion in plenty of drippings then 
fry the mutton five minutes. Parboil the sweetbreads and throw them 
into cold water and blanch. Wipe and dry them, then fry them in fat. 
Lay the salt pork, cut in slices in the bottom of the saucepan, upon this 
place the mutton, then the sweetbreads, the onion and peas next, then 
pepper, salt and parsley. Cover with the gravy, put on a close lid, stew 
gently for an hour. Then let it boil up once, remove the mutton and 
sweetbreads, thicken the gravy with brown flour, put in two beaten eggs, 
stir a minute over the fire, pour over the meat and serve.

LAHB STEW. 

Remove all the fat from a nice leg of lamb, cut off the shank, make 
deep incisions in various parts of the inside of the leg; fill them with 
stuffing made of crumbs of bread, salt pork, sweet marjoram and pepper; 
stuff it very full. Put hardly water enough in the pot to cover the leg. 
Throw in a dozen or two of cloves, one-half of an onion sliced or chopped 
very fine, and a little salt. One-half of a teacup of catsup or a few toma- 
toes improve it very much. Let it simmer steadily three hours. When 
you take up the leg, thicken the gravy if it is not thick enough. Put a 
few spoonfuls over the meat. A. P. 

BROILED nUTTON CHOPS. 

Select one dozen chops cut from the loin; trim, season with salt and 
pepper; dip in melted butter and broil over a clear fire nearly ten minutes, 
turning frequently. Lay on warm platter and garnish with a few sprigs 
of parsley. Ivy Smith. 

A GENUINE IRISH 5TEW. 

Cut two pounds of chops from the best end of a neck of mutton, and 
pare away nearly all the fat. A portion of the breast may be cut into 
squares and used, but a neck of mutton is the best joint for the purpose. 
Take as many potatoes as will amount after peeling to twice the weight 
of the meat. Slice them with eight large onions sliced. Put a layer of 
mixed potatoes and onions at the bottom of a stew-pan. Place the meat 
on this and season it plentifully with pepper, and lightly with salt. Pack 
closely, and cover the meat with another layer of potato and onion. 
Pour in as much water or stock as will moisten the topmost layer, cover 
the stew-pan tightly, and let Its contents simmer gently for three hours. 
Be careful not to remove the lid, as this will let out the flavor. 

Mrs. N. McGrath. 
SWEETBREAD CROQUETTES. 

Wash and parboil one pair of sweetbreads, then throw into cold 
water; remove outside skin and all membrane; then with silver knife 
chop in small pieces and measure. There should be one-half of a pint of 
chopped meat. Put one gill of cream into a saucepan; rub together one 
level teaspoonful of butter, a heaping teaspoonful of flour; stir into the 
hot cream until you have a smooth paste; add the yolk of one egg and 
the sweetbreads; mix and cook one minute, take from the fire and, if 
desired, add one dozen mushrooms chopped fine; if fresh, they must

VEAL OYSTERS. 

Cut veal from the leg or tenderloin into pieces the size of an 
oyster. Season with pepper, salt and a little mace; dip in egg, then into 
cracker crumbs and fry. They both look and taste like oysters. To be 
eaten with tomato sauce. L. D. T. 

BAKED VEAL PIE. 

Use the neck or any part of the veal which you prefer. Cook it by 
boiling an hour, then place the meat in a very deep dish, and when you 
lay on the upper crust wet the edge of the under crust all around and 
flour it; then lay on the upper crust and press your hand upon the edge, 
so that the flour and water will make the crusts adhere and prevent the 
gravy from escaping. Prick the top several times with a large fork. If 
you have pieces of crust left, cut them into leaves and ornament the pie. 
Bake one-half hour. M. A. M. 

VEAL, CHICKEN OR RABBIT BONDINETTES. 

To every pound of finely-minced meat add one-quarter of a pound of 
mashed potatoes; season with salt and pepper and moisten with a gravy 
made from the bones of the cold meat. Press the minced meat into well- 
buttered cups and bake for twenty minutes. Turn out on a dish, pour a little 
browned gravy round and stick a sprig of parsley into each bondinette.

crackers, three eggs, one-half pint of water, salt, pepper and sage to 
taste; bake three hours. D. C. M. 

VEAL CUTLETS WITH VERMICELLI. 

(German Style.) 

Remove all the fat, but not the small rib of the cutlet, season and 
turn in egg and crumbs, or dip in melted butter, then in cheese 
mixed with an equal quantity of crumbs (sifted); let this absorb, then 
dip in the ^gg and again in the cheese mixture. Stand aside for two 
hours, then fry in plenty of butter the same as doughnuts. In the mean- 
time boil some vermicelli in salt water until well done, then drain and mix 
with tomato sauce, arrange the vermicelli in the center of a chop- 
platter and place the cutlets around them. Serve hot. N. H. 

ROAST LOIN OF VEAL. 

Leave in the kidney, around which put considerable salt. Make a 
dressing the same as for fowls; unroll the loin, put the stuffing well 
around the kidney, fold and secure with several coils of white cotton 
twine wound around in all directions; place in a dripping-pan with the 
thick side down, and put in a rather hot oven, letting it cool down to 
moderate; in one-half hour add a little hot water to the pan, and baste 
often; half an hour after turn over the roast and when done dredge 
lightly with flour and baste with melted butter. Before serving, care- 
fully remove the twine. A roast of four to five pounds will bake in 
two hours. For a gravy, skim off some of the fat if there is too much in

ENTREE OF VEAL. 

Take a piece of butter the size of an &gg, three pounds of raw veal, 
one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper and two raw eggs. 
Chop fine and mix all together, adding two tablespoonfuls of water. 
Mold this into a loaf, then roll into it two tablespoonfuls of pounded 
crackers and pour over it three tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Place in 
a pan and bake two hours. When cold, slice and use.

VEAL WITH OYSTERS. 

Take two pounds of tender veal, cut into thin bits, dredge with flour 
and fry in enough hot lard to prevent sticking; when nearly done add 
one and one-half pints of oysters, thickened with a little flour; season with 
salt and pepper and cook until both are done. Serve very hot in a cov- 
ered dish. E. W. 

MEAT CROQUETTES. 

One pound of raw minced beef, one ^gg, one onion chopped fine with 
a little parsley, pepper and salt to taste. Form into cakes, dredge with

TO COOK CALF'5 HEAD. 

When the head has been cleaned, and split in halves, the eyes 
and snout bone taken away, lay it in cold water to soak, for two hours. 
Take out the brains, and wash them well in several waters, then lay them 
in cold water. Put the head together; cover it with cold water in the 
kettle and add a tablespoonful of salt; boil slowly for two or three hours. 
When it has, boiled a little more than an hour, take some of the liquor, 
about a quart, and put into a stew-pan for the gravy; add to this salt, 
pepper, parsley chopped fine, a tablespoonful of lemon juice and put over 
the fire to boil. Beat up an ^gg lightly, with two tablespoonfuls of flour, 
then remove carefully the skin from the brains, and beat them up with the 
egg and flour. When well beaten, thicken the gravy with it and stew fif- 
teen minutes. Mrs. Lucia Capper.

TO KEEP MEAT HOT. 

Often a piece of meat is done, and yet the head of the house is not 
there to partake of it. A nice way to keep it hot without drying it is to 
place it in a hot dish and set it over a large saucepan of hot water at the 
side of the fire. Put a cover over the pan, and again cover that with a 
cloth. A bain-marie is useful in every kitchen. It is an open vessel or 
pan with a loose bottom for holding hot water. It will keep meats hot, 
or sauces at boiling point without reduction or burning. F. T. Boyd. 

ROAST LOIN OF PORK. 

Pork should be chosen with great care. From the gluttonous habits 
of the animal it is more liable to disease than any other meat. It should 
be partaken of plentifully only in cold weather. Grainfed pork is 
the best. Score the skin of a fresh loin of pork at equal distances 
about one-quarter of an inch apart. Brush it over with salad oil, 
place it in a hot oven with a clear fire, but watch that the crackling 
does not burn before the meat is well cooked. Baste often, and 
heat the dish on which you send it to table. Serve with brown gravy and 
apple-sauce. If liked, a little sage and onion dressing may be made and 
served on a separate dish. It requires two hours and one-quarter to cook 
a five-pound roast. Mrs. Jane Hathaway.

FRIED SALT PORK. 

Take thin slices of pickled pork, fry lightly. Then mix a batter of 
&gg and flour and milk and immerse the pork in this till it has become 
completely covered and fry to a light brown. 

Mrs. Huldah Osgood. 

SALT PORK. 

(Nearly equal to fresh.) 

Cut as many slices as may be needed; if for breakfast, the night 
previous, and soak over night in a pint of milk and water, about one-half 
milk, either skimmed milk, sour milk or butter-milk; rinse till the water 
is clear, and roll in corn-meal and fry. It is quite as nice as fresh pork.

ROAST SPARE-RIB. 

Trim the ragged ends of a spare-rib neatly, crack the ribs across the 
middle, rub with salt and sprinkle with pepper. Fold it over, stuff with a 
turkey dressing, sew up tightly, place in dripping pan with a pint of water, 
baste frequently, turning it once or twice so as to bake both sides a rich 
brown Clara Jones. 

SADDLE OF PORK, ROASTED. 

Have the butcher cut a saddle of pork as he would a saddle of mut- 
ton. Strip off the skin, trim the joint neatly, and cover the fat with but- 
tered paper. Have a clear fire and baste liberally. One-half of an hour 
before it is taken up remove the paper, dredge the meat lightly with flour, 
and baste until it is brightly browned. Send brown gravy and apple- 
sauce or tomato-sauce to the table with it. If liked, the skin can be left 
on, and it will then require to be scored lengthwise, the same way in 
which the saddle is carved. This is the handsomest joint of pork that can 

be served. M. A. R. 

HOW TO COOK PIG'S CHEEK. 

Let a pickled pig's cheek boil gently until tender. Tie one-half of a 
pint of split peas loosely in a cloth, put them in boiling water, and boil 
one hour; take them out, pass them through a hair sieve, and mix with 
the pulp a little pepper and salt, an ounce of butter, and four well-beaten 
eggs. Stir the mixture over the fire until the eggs begin to set, then 
spread it upon the cheek, brush over with beaten egg, sprinkle bread 
raspings on it, put it in the oven a few minutes, and serve. It will take 
nearly three hours to boil it. The bread raspings are made of pieces of 
stale bread dried slowly in a warm oven till brown and hard, and then 
crushed to powder. They can be set away in glass jars and kept for use. 

Mrs. J. Howard. 
FRIED PORK CHOPS. 

The flavor of pork chops is enhanced by cutting chops thin. Sprinkle 
with salt and pepper and thoroughly dry. If a sausage flavor is liked, 
sprinkle over them a little powdered sage, pepper and salt. A little milk 
gravy can be made and poured over it if liked. Mary Laverty. 

PORK TENDERLOINS. 

Tenderloins should be sliced crosswise and flattened, then fried or 
broiled, seasoned with salt and pepper. If desired, when done remove to 
platter and make a gravy by dredging a little flour into the hot fat; if not 
enough add a little butter, stir until browned, and add a little milk or 
cream, stir until it boils and pour over the dish. Julia Dickersoh

HOW TO MAKE COUNTRY PORK SAUSAGES. 

Six pounds of lean fresh pork, three pounds of chine fat, three table- 
spoonfuls of salt, one and one-half tablespoonfuls of black pepper and 
four tablespoonfuls of pounded and sifted sage. Grind with a sausage 
grinder or a meat chopper the lean and fat pork finely, mix the seasoning 
in with the hands, taste to see that it has the right flavor, then make into 
flat balls or make long, narrow bags of stout muslin. Fill these with the 
meat and hang in a cold dark room. They can be used at once. 

Marie Buell. 
TO FRY CASED SAUSAGES. 

Place in the frying-pan, keep moving them about and turn frequently 

to prevent bursting; in ten or twelve minutes they will be sufficiently 

browned and cooked. Sausages are also nicely cooked by putting them 

in a baking pan and browning them in the oven, turning them once or 

twice. J. A. M.

FRIED HAM AND EGGS. 

Cut slices of ham very thin, trim off the rind, put into a hot frying-pan 
cooking until crisp. Place on a hot platter; pour off some of the grease, 
then carefully break the eggs separately in a saucer so that no bad be 
cooked and slip each &gg gently into the frying-pan. Do not turn them 
while frying, but gently tilt the pan so that the hot lard will be over them 
all. Cook about three minutes; the white must retain its transparency so 
that the yolk can be seen thought it. Lay a fried Qgg upon each slice of 
the ham, and serve hot. Mrs. M. F. Thommessen. 

BOILED HAM. 

Select the sweetest and best, wipe with a coarse cloth, then soak for 
an hour in cold water, to extract some of the salt. Cover with cold water, 
place over the fire and let it come to a moderate boil, keeping it steadily 
at this point. In cooking allow twenty minutes for each pound of meat. 
If the ham is to be served hot remove the skin, place on a platter, the fal 
side up, and stick in some whole cloves. If served cold, allow it to remain 
in the kettle until the water in which it was cooked becomes cold. This 
makes it more juicy. H. O. C.

ROAST PIG. 

Select a pig about six weeks old, wash it thoroughly inside and 
outside; wipe dry with a towel, salt inside and stuff it with a rich 
fowl dressing making it plump. Sew it up, place it in a kneeling 
posture in the dripping pan, salt and pepper the outside. Pour a 
little water into the dripping pan, baste with butter and water a few times 
as the pig warms, afterwards with gravy from the dripping pan. Roast 
from two to three hours. Make the gravy by skimming off most of the 
grease; stir in the pan a good tablespoonful of flour, turn in water to make 
it the right consistency, season and let all boil up once. Strain, and turn 
into a gravy-dish. Place the pig upon a large platter surrounded with 
parsley. Send to the table hot. In carving cut off head first; split the 
back, take off the hams and shoulders and separate the ribs.

BOLOGNA SAUSAGE. 

Take off the outer skin of the sausage. Slice the sausage very thin. 
Cover the bottom of a platter with leaves of parsley and lay the sausage 
on top, each slice touching the other. A few hard-boiled eggs can be cut 
into rings and sliced round, then laid upon the sausage. 

Mrs. Jane Cummings. 

SAUSAGE CROQUETTES. 

One cup of highly-seasoned sausage meat, one cup of hot riced potato, 
two hard-boiled eggs finely chopped, one-half of a tablespoonful of finely- 
chopped parsley, salt and pepper to taste. Bind together with one-half of 
an ^g^ slightly beaten. Mold into cork-shaped croquettes, roll in bread- 
crumbs and dip in &^^ slightly beaten, to which has been added two table- 
spoonfuls of cold water. Roll again in crumbs and fry in smoking hot Ko-

and send to the table. Mrs. C. I. Tibbits. 

PICKLED PIG'S FEET. 

Take three pounds of pig's shanks, one pound of veal from the 
shoulder. See that the butcher has cleaned them nicely. It is a safe 
precaution to scald the feet again and scrape them. Then put water over 
them, whole peppers, salt, bay-leaves and a little onion, and cook. When 
done remove the meat from the bones and cut into small pieces, then 
strain the liquid and put it back in the kettle with one-half of a cup of 
vinegar. Put the meat into this gravy and let it boil up, when it can be 
poured into a dish to cool. Have enough gravy to cover the meat. 

Mrs. B. Ralston. 
COLD HAM OR TONGUE. 

Slice ham in thin slices and arrange upon a platter with a bed of let- 
tuce leaves under it. Cut hard-boiled eggs and place on the ham. Boiled

TORTILLA OF HAM. 

One-half of a pound of ham is to be cooked, then chopped and put 
with one tablespoonful of butter into a pan. Beat three eggs well and 
season. Pour them into the ham and stir for a moment, then let the 
tortilla set, being careful that it does not adhere to the pan. When it is 
a little brown, turn and brown the other side. Mrs. F. T. W,

TRIPE STEW. 

Many people reject tripe; and we do not wonder when they can onl)' 
obtain the leathery affair known as pickled tripe, which cooks try to dis- 
guise by frying in batter. But fresh tripe, which has never seen vinegar, 
is quite another thing. Cut the tripe (the honeycomb is the most tender 
part) into pieces about five inches long by four wide. Place them on the 
stove in just enough hot water to cover them. Cut up six or seven onions 
in fine shavings, adding them to the tripe. Let the water simmer slowly

YORKSHIRE PUDDING SERVED WITH MEAT. 

O^ie pint of milk, four eggs (beating whites and yolks separate), tv o 

cups of flour, one teaspoonful of salt. If the batter grows too stiff, use loss 

flour. Mix quickly. When the roast of beef is one-half done pour off 

the fat from the gravy in the pan, leaving enough to keep the pudding 

from sticking to the bottom. Pour the batter into the pan and roast the 

beef till done letting the drippings fall upon the pudding. Have a brisk 

oven. Baste the meat with the gravy taken out to make room for the 

batter. In serving cut the pudding into squares and lay about the meat in 

the dish. Mrs. Mary Allen.

as possible. Salt and pepper and fry brown in butter. When done, take 
up and make a cream gravy. Pour the cream gravy over as many slices 
of toast as there are veal birds. Lay the birds on top, garnish with 
parsley, and send to table. Mrs. M. Brewek. 




HIGH authorities frequently make the statement that many of our 
physical ailments are due to poor bread. This being the case, why 
then do we not compound good bread, when it is just as easy to make as 
bad bread? Some cooks advise pure, lukewarm water in mixing breads 
to the exclusion of potato water, milk and water, milk alone, or milk and 
whey. Mrs. Rorer, the well-known Eastern instructor, advises the leav- 
ing out of sugar and eggs when making the every-day bread and biscuits. 
She says "it is not a matter of mere chance, how this dough 
is to be made. Into the pan with the water is to be stirred ^^!?;=^ fl 

flour enough so the whole mass can be set on a well-floured ^^^ (/<^ 

board. The hands are to be covered with flour also. The 
dough farthest from the operator is to be turned over into 
the middle of the mass a number of times, and then moved 
half-way around. The former procedure is gone through 
with, taking the dough farthest away and pressing it down 
into the center, either with the fingers or the ball of the 
hand. A rocking motion adds to the eflicacy of the 
kneading. 

"At the outset flour is to be dusted on the board from 
time to time, until the sticky stage has been passed. As 
soon as the dough does not stick to the clean board, even 
when pressed down, the process is finished. It should take 
not less than a quarter of an hour, at the least." She 
approves the compressed yeast made in the cities, but insists 
on its being freshly made. "Salt-rising bread," she says, 
"is made with the wild yeast of the air and is never so 
wholesome, as the odor it gives out in baking goes to show." 

Another suggestion she makes is that it is best to make 
bread in the morning rather than to set it over night. The 
sunlight has a good effect upon it, the kitchen is of a 

9 t33 




134 BREAD, BISCUIT, MUFFINS, WAFFLES, ETC. 

more equable temperature and better ventilated, and It is easier to 
take the bread at just the right moment, "when it has doubled its 
bulk and is very light." A useful idea to be adopted in case it can- 
not be given attention on the minute is to stir in a handful of flour and 
beat it in thoroughly, letting the dough stand thirty or forty minutes 
more. The baking remains, and this is as important as any other 
process. It is better to mold the dough into the pans at once and let it 
rise in them. The oven should be above the boiling point of water, at 
least, otherwise the yeast plant will not be killed and the process of fer- 
mentation will be carried too far. 

On the other hand, too high a temperature cooks the outside of the 
bread so quickly that the inside remains unpenetrated by the heat. One 
way of finding if the oven is sufficiently heated consists in holding the 
hand inside it while twenty is counted slowly. If positive discomfort 
makes it necessary to withdraw the hand the oven is too hot; if no discom- 
fort is felt at all it is too cool. Bread in shallow French pans must go into 
a quick oven and be browned at once; larger loaves should be kept in an 
oven cool enough to keep them without browning at least ten minutes. 

Flour should be kept dry, as the least dampness will affect it. Where 
milk is used the milk should be boiled, not simply heated, and not allowed 
to be below a luke-warm temperature. An earthen vessel should be used 
in preference to wood or tin, as it can be kept cleaner and will preserve 
the temperature of "the sponge" better than the latter. If the flour is 
white, with a slightly yellowish or straw-colored tint, it is a sign that the 
flour is good. If it is very white, with a bluish cast, or with black specks 
in it, the flour is not good. 

In the making of biscuit, rolls, gems, griddle cakes, etc., where bak- 
ing-powder is used, the dough must never be kneaded, as the leavening 
properties of the baking-powder supersede the necessity for such work. 
The general rule of proportion is two heaping teaspoonfuls of the 
powder to each quart of flour, sifting the powder and flour well together 
in a dry state. 

BOTTLED YEAST TO KEEP THRO^ QH WARM WEATHER. 

Six medium potatoes grated, add twenty tablespoonfuls of flour, two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, one tablespoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of 
ginger; stir the above smooth; add boiling water, the same as you make 
flour starch, only not quite as thin, then add yeast; when little bubbles 
appear stir it well and stir well every one-half hour all day, then bottle 
for use. Mrs. D. R. Parsons.

HOME-MADE HOP YEAST. 

Take a good pinch of hops and tie in a cloth; put over this one quart 

A water, add three good-sized potatoes pared and put all in a kettle to 

:>oil until potatoes are done. Take out the hops, mash the potatoes, and 

?tir in about one quart of sifted flour, to which add one-half of a cupful of 

sugar. Have some prepared yeast ready, soaked, and, when cool enough, 

stir it into the other ingredients. Set to rise and then stiffen with corn- 

'neal. Dry in the wind or shade. When dry cut in thin cakes, or leave in 

^umps. Mrs. L. A. Hall. 

HOriE-MADE YEAST— No. a. 

To one large or two small potatoes one pint of hops, one leaf of tansy, 
one-half of a pint of catnip leaves, add three quarts of water. Boil until 
potatoes are soft. Strain while hot over one pint of flour. When cool 
add one pint of home-made yeast (previously soaked). Stir in flour to 
form rather a stiff batter. Let rise from ten to fourteen hours. Thicken 
mth. corn-meal, form in small cakes and dry in a cool, airy, place, never in

POTATO YEAST. 

Peel and wash three large potatoes throwing them into cold water. 

Put one-half of a teacupful of flour into a bowl with an equal amount of 

sugar and a tablespoonful of salt; over these grate the potatoes quickly 

and stir the whole well with a wooden spoon. Pour a pint of boiling 

water into the bowl, stirring it into the mixture, and add enough more of 

the boiling water to make the mixture of the consistency of thin starch. 

Should the preparation refuse to thicken put in a double boiler over the 

6re and stir it until it does thicken; then pour it through a fine sieve 

mto a bowl and let it cool. When lukewarm stir in a breakfast-cupful of 

yeast, cover the bowl and set in a warm, but not hot, place and let it stand 

until light and covered with a white foam. When it commences to rise 

beat well and when it has thoroughly risen pour it off into wide-mouthed 

earthen jars, letting it remain for twelve hours, then cover the jars tightly 

and put in a cool place. One-half of a pint or so of the yeast should be 

put into a glass jar for making the succeeding lot of potato yeast. The 

jars should always be well shaken before the yeast is used.

YEAST BREAD (WITHOUT KNEADINQ). 

At noon take a dish (a two-quart lard pail is good for this purpose) 

and put into it one tablespoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of sugar and 

two tablespoonfuls of flour with enough cold or tepid water to mix to a

eream without lumps. Pour into this the boiling water in which potatoe<i 
have boiled for dinner. Put in at the same time a yeast cake (I use Yeast 
Foam) in a cup of cold water. When the yeast is cold pour the softened 
yeast cake and the water, in which it has stood, into the pail of yeast and 
let it stand until night. Then put all into the bread-pan, add flour, and 
make a batter. (If this is not enough for one baking a little water may be 
added.) Let rise until morning, then mix up hard and let it rise again. 
Do not mix down at all. When ready put in loaves and let rise until 
ready to bake. Excellent. M. A. McD. 

BREAD MADE FROM DRY YEAST. 

Put into the baking-dish two quarts of sifted flour, less one teacup- 
ful, to be used on the board when kneading; mix with it one teaspoonful 
of salt; rub in well one tablespoonful of either butter, Ko-nut or lard. 
Mix one-half of a teacupful of baker's yeast, or its equivalent, one-half of 
a cake of dry hop or compressed yeast, with one pint of lukc-warm water 
and pour it into the middle of the flour, mixing the whole with a large 
spoon until the proper consistency for the dough has been attained, using 
either more water or flour, as may be needed. Knead the mass for about 
one-half of an hour and set in a warm place to rise. By morning it should 
have about doubled in bulk. Knead it over with a little flour, shape into 
loaves, and after it has risen in the pans put into the oven and bake. 
Do not have the oven too hot at first. When done take out of the pan 
and lean it against something until cool. Mrs. T. Anderson. 

BREAD MAOE FROM YEAST FOAM. 

Take at night one cake of yeast foam and dissolve it in luke-warm 
water. Turn in a bread-pan and mix into it one quart of warm water to 
which has been added one tablespoonful of salt and one tablespoonful of 
sugar; add enough flour to make it just stiff enough to beat briskly. Set 
to rise. Next morning pour this sponge into two quarts of sifted flour 
with one pint of warm water and one tablespoonful of salt. Mix well into 
a smooth soft dough. When light make into four loaves and bake about 
one hour in a moderately hot oven. Anna L. Tholoney, 

SALT RISING BREAD. 

Put three teacupfuls of water, as warm as you can bear your finger in, 
in a two-quart bowl with three-fourths of a teaspoonful of salt. Stir in 
flour to make stiff batter. This is for the rising, or emptyings, as some 
call it. Set the bowl, closely covered, in a kettle, in water as warm as you 
can bear your finger in, and keep it as near this temperature as possible 



BREAD, BISCUIT, MUFFINS, WAFFLES, ETC, 137, 

Notice the time you set your rising. In three hours stir in two tablespoon- 
fuls of flour, put it back and in five and one-half hours from the time of 
setting it will be within one inch of the top of your bowl. It is then light 
enough and will make up eight quarts of flour. Make a sponge in the 
center of your flour with one quart of water of the same temperature as 
the rising, stir the rising into it, cover over with a little dry flour and put it 
where it will keep very warm and not scald. In three-fourths of an hour 
mix this into stiff dough. If water is used, be sure it is very warm and do 
not work as much as yeast bread. Make the loaves a little larger and 
keep it warm for another three-quarters of an hour. It will then be ready 
to bake. While rising this last time, have your oven heating. It needs a 
hotter oven than yeast bread. If these rules are followed, you will have 
bread as white as snow with a light brown crust deliciously sweet and 
tender. Mrs. Jennie Mills. 

POTATO BREAD. 

Take six good-sized potatoes, boil and mash very fine. Add three 
pints of boiling water. Stir in flour until you have a stiff batter. When it 
has become luke-warm add your yeast (about a penny's worth) and set the 
bread in a moderately warm place. Next morning add salt and knead in 
flour till it is very stiff. Set in a warm place to rise. Knead once more, 
adding very little flour. Let it rise once more, and put into pans, making 
them one-half full. When risen to the top of pans, bake to a good brown.

ENTIRE WHEAT BREAD (FROM COMPRESSED YEAST). 

Take a quart of quite hot, but not scalding, water and dissolve in it one 
cake of compressed yeast, three tablespoonfuls of New Orleans molasses, 
two teaspoonfuls of salt and two tablespoonfuls of butter. When thor- 
oughly dissolved add about eight cups of entire or whole-wheat flour, 
enough to make a good stiff dough, kneading it until it works clean from 
the hands. Set in a warm place to rise for about three hours, then work 
well and let it stand till light again, then work into four loaves and place 
in well-greased pans. Grease the top to prevent a crust forming, cover 
with a cloth and let stand till light — about one and one-half hours. Bake 
for thirty-five minutes in a moderately hot oven, not as hot as for white 
bread. This recipe makes most delicious bread — moist, light and tender.

RICE BREADo 

Allow one-half of a pint of ground rice to one quart of milk and 
water; put the milk and water over the fire to boil, reserving enough to 
wet the rice. Stir out the lumps, add a large teaspoonful of salt and when 
the milk and water boil stir in the rice, exactly as when you make gruel. 
Boil it up two or three minutes, stirring repeatedly; then pour it out into 
your bread-pan and immediately stir in as much flour as you can with a 
spoon. After it is cool (of this be \^ery sure, as scalding the yeast will 
make heavy, sour bread, full of great holes), add a gill of yeast, and let it 
stand until morning. Then knead in more flour until the dough ceases to 
stick to the hands. It is necessary to make this kind of bread a little 
stiffer than that in which no rice is used, else there will be a heavy streak 
through the loaf. This is elegant bread and keeps moist several days. 

Mrs. Henry Cole. 

STEAMED BROWN BREAD. 

To one well-beaten ^^^ add two cupfuls of graham flour, one cupful 
of wheat, one cupful of molasses, a little salt and enough sour mlik to 
which has been added soda to mix the ingredients to a stiff batter. Pour 
into a medium-sized buttered pan and steam two and one-half hours or 
longer, according to the size of the loaf. Mrs. Marseltjs, 

STEAMED BROWN BREAD— No. 2. 

The ingredients are: one coffee-cupful of graham flour, one coffee- 
cupful of yellow corn-meal, one coffee-cupful of white flour. Sift them 
together, sift into the flour one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of 
soda; one-half of a teacupful of sugar, three-quarters of a cupful of 
molasses (not syrup), two cupfuls of sour milk. Put all in a lard pail, 
cover tight, set in a kettle of boiling water. It must boil steadily for two 
and one-half hours. A. H. Duffell. 

QRANDHOTHER'S BROWN BREAD. 

Take three pints of rye-meal and add to the same amount of corn- 
meal. The yellow meal is preferable to the white. When meal is fresh 
do not scald it, but v/hen it is old, or a little bitter, do so. When any 
squash is left over add a few spoonfuls to the meal. Use one-half of a 
teacupful of molasses, two teaspoonfuls of salt, and one teaspoonful of 
soda with one-half of a teacupful of yeast. Mix it with warm water as 
stiff as you can stir it. Butter two iron pans plentifully and put the bread 
in them. Have a bowl of cold water at hand, and smooth over the top of

the ioaves dipping your hand in the water. It rises very quickly, and 
should never be made over night in the summer. In the winter it may 
stand in a cool place, till nearly ready to bake. It:wants a hot oven, and 
very long baking. A brick oven is the best, and then the loaves should 
remain in overnight. Agnes Kent. 

INDIAN BREAD. 

There is no bread so healthy diSgood Indian bread. Take three pints 
of rye-meal, three of Indian-meal; mix with this two tablespoonfuls of

GRAHAM OR ENTIRE WHEAT BREAD. 

Take four heaping cupfuls of graham flour, one teaspoonful of salt, 
one-half of a coffee-cupful of molasses, one heaping teaspoonful of salera- 
tus. This last must be dissolved in a little hot water and stirred into the 
molasses until it foams well. Pour it on the meal, add enough milk to 
make the dough as stiff as cake mixture; put it into two pans and bake 
until done. Annie L. C. 

STEAHED ENTIRE WHEAT BREAD.

salt, and corn-meal enough to make a moderately stiff batter and stir well 
Instead of baking steam this loaf, having for the purpose a tin pudding- 
form or bucket, with a close-fitting lid. Into this (well buttered) pour the 
batter in the morning. After standing an hour or two, and when perfectly 
light, place the bucket in a pot of boiling water, and steam It one and one- 
half or two hours. This will make a nice, light brown loaf.

gradually the eggs and milk and a little salt; beat until smooth. Put at 
once into greased hot gem-pans and bake in a moderately quick oven for 
forty-five minutes. If properly baked, they should swell six times their 
original bulk, and may be used for breakfast or luncheon, or served with 
a liquid pudding sauce as a dessert. Iron gem-pans insure better results 
than those made of lighter metals.

ROLLS FOR TEA. 

Make the rolls of bread dough. When they have risen enough, slit 

each roll lengthwise about an inch deep. When they are baked brush 

them with thin boiled corn-starch and water, and put back in the oven for 

a moment. The white of an egg will glaze them also. 

Mrs. Hettie Stanwood. 
SPICED ROLLS. 

Take a piece of your bread dough or baking-powder biscuit dough 
and roll it one-half of an inch thick, brush the top with melted butter and 
cover thick with cinnamon and fine white sugar; begin at one side and 
roll as jelly cake, then cut it an inch thick and lay in a pan as biscuits, 
close together, and let them rise. Bake twenty minutes. If baking- 
powder dough is used bake immediately. Mrs. Walter Butler, 

ENGLISH BREAKFAST ROLLS. 

Roll one-quarter of a pound of butter into a pound of flour; then add 
a teaspoonful of good yeast, and break in one ^gg. Mix it with a little 
warm milk poured into the middle of the flour; stir all well together, and 
set it by the fire to rise; then make it into light dough and again set by 
the fire. Make up the rolls, lay them on a tin, and set them in front of 
the fire before you put them into the oven, and brush them over with ^gg. 

Mrs. Lily Farnsworth. 

RAISED CINNAMON ROLLS. 

When yeast bread is ready to knead into loaves, take as much of the 
dough as is needed and roll out about two-thirds of an inch thick. Spread 
on top a thin layer of butter, then sugar, and upon this sprinkle cinnamon. 
Roll the dough as you would for a jelly-cake roll, and slice off as many 
rolls as you want. Put these in a pan to rise as you would light biscuits. 
When raised, bake a nice brown. Madge E. Miller.

drop the biscuits from a spoon in pieces about the size of a silver dollar. 
Bake in a slow oven. Candace Phelps. 

CHOCOLATE BISCUIT. 

(Especially appropriate for chocolataires and afternoon teas.) 
Cover three large baking-pans with paper that has been well-oiled 
with washed butter. Over these dredge powdered sugar. Melt in a cup 
one ounce of chocolate. Separate the whites and yolks of four eggs. 
Add to the yolks a generous one-half cupful of powdered sugar, and beat 
until light and firm. Add the melted chocolate, and beat a few minutes 
longer. Beat the whites of the eggs to a stiff, dry froth. Measure out 
three-fourths of a cupful of sifted flour, and stir it and the whites into the 
yolks. The whites and flour must be cut in as lightly as possible, and with 
very little stirring. Drop the mixture in teaspoonfuls on the buttered 
paper. Sprinkle powdered sugar over the cakes and bake in a slow oven 
for about fourteen or fifteen minutes. The mixture can be shaped like 
lady fingers, if preferred. Miss Parloa.

CHOCOLATE WAFERS. 

(For receptions and chocolataires.) 

Grate four ounces of chocolate and mix with it two tablespoonfuls of 
flour and one-fourth of a teaspoonful each of cinnamon, cloves and bak- 
ing-powder. Separate six eggs. Add one cupful of powdered sugar to 
the yolks, and beat until very light; then add the grated yellow rind and 
the juice of one-half of a lemon, and beat five minutes longer. Now add 
the dry mixture, and with a spoon lightly cut in the whites, which are first 
to be beaten to a stiff froth. Pour the mixture into buttered shallow pans, 
having it about one-half of an inch thick. Bake in a moderate oven for 
one-half of an hour. When the cake is cool, spread a thin layer of cur- 
rant jelly over one sheet, and place the other sheet on this. Ice with 
vanilla icing, and when this hardens, cut in squares. It is particularly 
nice to serve with ice-cream. Maria Parloa. 

ENTIRE WHEAT CRACKERS. 

Mix fresh-ground wheat-meal with pure soft water into a stiff dough. 
Roll out and cut the mass into thin crackers, not quite as thick as the Bos- 
ton cracker of the shops, but larger in circumference, and bake in a brick 
oven. Be very cautious and not over-cook or burn them. 

Mrs. Jane Pape. 

SWEET CRACKERS. 

One cup of lard, one and one-half cups of sugar, two eggs well beaten, 
one pint of sweet milk, five cents' worth of the oil of lemon and three 
tablespoonfuls of baking ammonia. Mix lard and sugar together, put in 
the eggs and milk, ammonia and lemon, and make a stiff dough. Roll 
thin as pie-crust, cut in squares and stick with a stiff dough. Better after 
ammonia evaporates a few hours. These crackers keep for months if 
desired. Have the druggist pulverize the ammonia. 

Miss Estella Lane. 

OATMEAL CAKE. 

Mix fine oatmeal into a stiff dough with milk-warm water; roll \\ to 
the thinness almost of a wafer; bake on a griddle or iron plate placed 
over a slow fire for three or four minutes; then place it on edge before 
the fire to harden. This will be good for months if kept in a dry place. 
Like hard crackers, it is an excellent article to exercise sedentary teeth 
upon. Mrs. H. Hines.

Mix with a pint of flour a piece of butter the size of an egg. Rub 
well with two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar in flour. Powder fine one 
teaspoonful of soda. Add one cupful of cold water, making a stiff batter. 
Bake on tin for tea. If you prefer baking-powder use two teaspoonfuls 
of same in place of cream of tartar and soda. You can substitute sour 
milk or buttermilk for either and it makes the cake (or bread) much nicer 
Bake quickly. Mrs. Lissie Ford. 

PRETZELS. 

Into two cupfuls of flour put one-third of a cup of butter, the yolks of

TOAST 




^ 




THE object of toasting bread is to extract the water, enabling it to 
digest more freely. 
Bread should be warmed first for the purpose of drying, then toasted 
carefully a pale gold color. By this method the moisture is drawn out, 
and thus becomes the pure farina of wheat which is easy to digest. The 
fire should be clear and hot, the bars clean. The bread should be cut one- 
quarter of an inch thick, the crusts trimmed and sent to the table as soon 
as done. Some prefer the moist toast instead of dry; in that case, after 
buttering, pour a very little water from the tea-kettle upon it, letting it 
penetrate the slices 

QERriAN TOAST. 

Cut slices of stale bread, dip them in enough milk to soften, then dip 
in beaten egg; put in a pan with just sufficient butter to fry brown as an 
omelet, then serve. Like pancakes, the hotter the toast the better. 

Mrs. Roth. 

HAn TOAST. 

Chop cold boiled ham very fine, toast slices of bread and butter them. 
After laying the ham on the toast place in the oven for a few minutes. 
Beat up six eggs with milk and salt and pepper. Pour the eggs into a 
saucepan with a lump of butter and stir till thick, but do not boil. Put 
the ham and toast on a platter, pour the eggs over, and serve. 

Mrs. Tillie Monreal. 

TOAST FOR GAME. 

Toast slices of bread one-third of an inch thick till brightly browned 
on both sides. Cut off the crust, hold the bread over a bowl of boiling 
water for a minute to imbibe the steam, and butter well. Soak them in 
the dripping in the pan under the birds, and when these are ready, serve 
them upon it. ^^^ Mrs. H. Collier.

SANDWICHES are the sole dependence of the picnicker. They are 
also much used at luncheons, afternoon teas, etc. When nicely 
made they are very appetizing. White, graham, brown bread, or rolls, may 
be converted into sandwiches, and each according to the individual taste. 
There is no limit to their filling, for eggs, meat, fowl, fruit, fish, salads, 
jams and chopped nuts are all pressed into service. Their shape can be 
varied; they may be cut in circles, or rolled like omelets, but the most 
common form is the square or triangular. 

The materials used in a sandwich should be minced or sliced as fine 
as possible so that they may be eaten with little trouble, and the season- 
ing should be added to the filling. Butter should be of the finest quality, 
and spread so smoothly that it will not flake off when the sandwich is 
handled. Graham, rye, or brown bread is very tender and nutritious, 
and many prefer them to the white. A square loaf cuts up nicely. But 
no sandwich should have the crust left on, and the slices composing it 
should be thin and of equal size. 

When fish is used it should be pounded to a paste and mixed with 
another paste made of hard-boiled eggs, cream, and butter, seasoned. 

LETTUCE SANDWICHES. 

Sprinkle fresh crisp lettuce leaves with a little salt and lay them a few 

moments in a folded napkin, then lay them between slices of bread that 

have been buttered. Spread over a dressing of Mayonnaise or not, as 

preferred. Mrs. L. Kay. 

OLIVE SANDWICHES. 

Stone and chop olives and mix with Mayonnaise. Butter the bread, 

which must be cut very thin. Either white or brown bread may be used. 

A Western Girl. 
BAKED BEAN SANDWICHES. 

Beat one-half of a cup of baked beans to a smooth paste. Add one- 
half of a teaspoonful of chopped parsley and celery, one-quarter of a tea- 
spoonful of onion juice and made mustard enough to just cover the end of 
a teaspoon. Spread between slices of graham or rye bread. 

Mrs. Cornie Lawson.

162 SANDWICHES AND CANAPES. 

"RAnONA" SANDWICHES. 

These are fancy bits used at a company luncheon in honor of Helen 
Hunt Jackson's pretty Indian story and are well worth the trouble of 
making. Chop about equal quantities of figs, dates, raisins, citron or any 
candied fruits and a tiny bit of candied peel. Place lightly in a square or 
round mold the shape of the sandwiches and pour over it crab-apple jelly. 
Move a fork gently through the mass to be sure the jelly settles all 
around the fruit. Set the mold in a cold place until firm; then turn out 
and cut off in thin slices. Serve on thin bits of New England brown bread 
very lightly buttered. California Girl's Favorite. 

TURTLE SANDWICHES (FOR HALLOWEEN AND CHILDREN'S PARTIES).

ing desired — meat, cheese, nut or fruit. Now slice lengthwise into halves 
some small cucumber pickles (sweet or sour), and stick one of these in 
each corner of the sandwich for the feet of the turtle, and a tiny one for 
the tail. Run a toothpick through a narrow and short piece of bread and 
stick it in the opposite end of the sandwich from the tail. On the end of 
the toothpick put a thin piece of a small carrot cut crosswise. Behold! 
you have the turtle. Serve singly on individual plates with olives made 
after the fashion of Natural History Objects. Mrs. A. E. Fowler.

between thin slices of brown bread. Delicious. Mrs. R. A, Brown. 

ANNIVERSARY OR VALENTINE SANDWICHES. 

Have white and brown bread one day old. Prepare by spreading 
the end of the loaf with soft butter or mayonnaise dressing and cutting off 
in thin wafer-like slices until the requisite amount has been cut. Then 
with a heart-shaped cooky-cutter cut from each slice of brown bread, a 
generous heart and from each white slice a diamond-shaped piece. Have 
ready some pounded nuts and any two kinds of filling that you prefer. 
On a slice of the spread brown bread put a thin layer of one kind of filling, 
cover with a slice of the brown bread. Use the other kind of filling on 
the white bread and cover with the white bread. Prepare a number in 
this way, then reverse the order. J. T. G. 

APPLE AND CELERY SANDWICHES.

166 SANDWICHES AND CANAPES, 

SARDINE CANAPES. 

Take sardines, the yolks of three or four hard-boiled eggs, a little but- 
ter, mustard, pepper, and vinegar, slices of toast. Cut some slices off a 
roll neatly into oval or octagon shapes. Toast slightly, or fry in oil or 
butter till they are of a nice yellow color. Strip the sardines of the bones: 
lay one-half of them aside, and pound the other to a smooth paste with 
the eggs and butter. Add the mustard, pepper and vinegar. When 
these ingredients are well mixed, spread the paste over the prepared 
slices of toast. On the top lay the other one-half of the sardines, cut 
into small strips, stand them in the oven and serve very hot. 

Mrs. M. Waters. 
PLAIN CANAPES. 

Toast thin slices of bread from which the crust has been removed, 
and butter them a very little. Either potted meat or fish can be spread 
over them. The grated cheese that comes in little jars makes nice ones. 
Place two slices together and cut into strips before bringing to the table. 

Mrs. Herman. 

JEFFERSON CANAPES. 

Trim three slices of bread evenly, toast a light brown and lay them on 
a platter. Slice lean cooked ham thin with a little mustard on it and place 
on each slice also a layer of cooked mushrooms and tomatoes. Dredge 
grated Parmesan cheese on top, and strew fresh bread-crumbs over the 
whole. Place in a hot oven for ten minutes. Lay on a heated dish, cover 
with a folded napkin and serve. Mrs. J. L. Walters. 

OYSTER CANAPES. 

Select one-half dozen large oysters and chop them quite fine. To 
their bulk add a teaspoonful of fine bread-crumbs, a piece of butter as 
big as a walnut and one-quarter of a cup of very thick cream. Season 
with salt and pepper. Let it simmer over the fire a few minutes. Butter 
some slices of bread one-eight of an inch in thickness and lay them on a 
hot dish. Pour the mixture over the bread and serve hot. 

Mrs. Frederic Monteith. 




THERE are but few housewives who consider a dinner complete 
to-day without cheese of some kind in some form. 

Many kinds, however, are considered a luxury even by the well-to-do, 
owing to the fact that they are made across the water and duty on them 
is high. Americans have tried to imitate the making of native European 
cheese and in some instances have succeeded, but in others have failed. 

The monopoly of ':he trade on the Roquefort cheese, is still retained 
by France. This cheese comes from the town of the same name, south- 
west of Paris. It is made from cow's milk and the little green specks in it 
are merely coarse crumbled bread which the peasants throw in when mak- 
ing the cheese. After the cheese is made it is carried to cellars regularly 
prepared where it is left to cure. 

Brie cheese originally came from the town of Brie, north of Paris. 
It, too, is made of cow's milk. Unlike the Roquefort, however, it has been 
successfully imitated in America. At the present time very little is 
imported from France. The Limburger cheese which was once manufac- 
tured abroad is to-day made very successfully in this country. The JEdan 
cheese is still brought to this country in large quantities. So far, Ameri- 
cans have never been able to imitate the Hollanders in making it. The 
Parmesan cheese, so much desired by French chefs, is made only in Italy. 
Sago cheese, made from the milk of goats, is manufactured in Switzer- 
land. The cheese mostly made in America is that known as English 
cheese. Americans have quite solved the method of making it to perfec- 
tion. To-day more of our cheese is exported to England than has ever 
been imported from that co antry to America. 

HOW TO KEEP CHEESE MOIST. 

Cheese dries very fast and soon becomes too hard for the table- 
Anything that excludes the air will prevent its drying. Keeping it under 
glass is a good method, but an easier and surer one is to take cheese-cloth. 

167 



168 CHEESE AND CHEESE DISHES. 

dip it in white wine, squeeze it nearly dry and wrap the cheese in it. It 
does not impair its flavor in the least. When cheese becomes very hard, it 
is fine for macaroni, as it can be grated easier. 

CREAM CHEESE. 

Put five quarts of the last milking of a cow, called strippin^s, in a 
granite pan with two tablespoonsful of rennet. When the curd comes 
strike it down with the skimmer to break it. Let it stand two hours; spread 
a cheese cloth on a sieve and drain upon it; salt and break the curd a little 
with the hand; put it into a press with a two-pound weight upon it. After 
standing twelve hours, bind a linen cheese-cloth round. Turn every day 
till dry; rubbing the outside with butter and let gradually ripen. 

Domestic Cheese Maker. 

COTTAGE CHEESE. 

When the milk which has been left over sours so as to be clabbered, 
place it in a tin pan and set it over a pan of hot water. Heat it very 
slowly, so that the whey may become separated from the curd. If it boils, 
the curd will be tough. Strain it through a cloth, and press out the whey. 
Stir in a little butter, cream and salt till it Is moist enough. Work it well 
with a spoon till it is smooth, then make it into little pats for the table.

butter, one-half of a teacupful of cream or rich milk, one-half of a nutmeg 
grated and one salt-spoonful of salt. Mix the cracker crumbs dry with 
the cheese, first removing the wrapper and taking ofif the thin skin on the 
outside of the cheese; crumble the cheese and cracker crumbs well 
together, beat eggs well with the sugar and add, following with the butter 
and cream. If the cream is very rich the butter may be omitted. Put in 
lemon, nutmeg and currants. Mix all well together and put into well- 
buttered patty pans lined with puff paste. Bake twenty minutes in a quick 
oven. They will puff up, but must not be permitted to get too brown.

in blocks two and one-half inches square. Serve hot on toast. 

Nannie Jones. 

SLIP. 

Slip is bonny-clabber, without its acidity, and so delicate is its flavor 
that many like it as well as ice-cream. Prepare it thus: Make one quart 
of milk moderately warm, stir into it one dessert-spoonful of the prepara- 
tion called rennet; set it away t6 cool; it will be then as stiff as jelly; 
make it only a few hours before using or it will be tough and watery; 
when possible set dish on ice after it has jellied. Serve with powdered 
sugar, nutmeg and cream. Prudence M. S. 

MACARONI AND CHEESE.

CHEESE. 

(German.) 

Three quarts milk, salt, caraway seed. 

The milk must be fresh and rich. Put each quart in a separate dish; 
after it has thickened remove the cream and prepare it as for cottage 
cheese, drain it well to separate it from all the whey. When this is done 
take a granite colander, sprinkle the bottom with salt and caraway seed, 
on this put a layer of curds (one quart), next one of cream, again salt and 
caraway seed and one of curds until all is used up. The last layer must 
be of curds; let it stand two or three days, then turn out and serve. 

Fraulein. 

MOTHER'S CREAM CHEESE. 

Scald the quantity of milk desired, let cool a trifle, then add the ren- 
net (see directions on the packages of "Prepared Rennet"). When the 
curd is formed take out without breaking and lay on a cheese-cloth 
supported on all sides so that it will drain; and then put it under a 
light press for one hour; now break the curd gently with the fingers 
into small pieces, put in a cloth and press for an hour; take out, rub with 
fine salt, let lie on a board for an hour, and wash in cold water; then 
let drain, and in a day or two the skin will look dry; put some sweet grass 
under and over and it will soon ripen. E. M. C. 

CHICAGO CHEESE STRAWS. 

Roll some puff paste very thin, sprinkle over with grated cheese, fold, 
roll out, and sprinkle again; then repeat the process and place on the ice 
to harden. When cold roll out to an oblong flat one-eight of an inch 
thick, place it on a baking sheet and, with a knife, cut into strips five 
inches long and less than one-quarter of an Inch wide. Bake and serve 
piled in triangles or squares. M. L, C. 

SAGE CHEESE. 

Pound the tops of fresh young sage leaves with the same quantity of 
spinach leaves, and squeeze out the juice. Add this to some extract of 
rennet and stir into the milk a sufficient quantity to suit the taste. When 
the curd comes, break, salt it, put into the vat, press for a few hours, take 
out of press and then rub and turn the cheese every day for two weeks.

OVER FIFTY WAYS TO COOK THEM. 

THERE is probably no one article of food that enters so frequently 
into the composition of dishes for the table as do eggs. Their 
value as food is well known, the nutriment in them as well as their ease 
of digestion entitling them to be considered as one of the most useful 
articles for daily use. In some households they are the principal break- 
fast dish, and the variety of ways in which they can be used greatly 
enhances their value. 

HOW TO TEST GOOD AND BAD EGGS. 

A sure test of the freshness of an egg is to immerse it in water. 
Should it sink to the bottom and lie on its side it is good but if the egg is 
stale, it will float or stand upon one end. 

The "candling" process consists in looking through the egg at a light, 
or holding it between you and the sun. If it shows up clear and spotless 
so that the yolk can be perceived, it is good, otherwise, it is not; also, in 
shaking an egg, if it makes a sound it is not a good egg and should be 
rejected. 

HOW TO PRESERVE EGGS FOR WINTER USE. 

In many households eggs are regarded as expensive, and so they are. 
perhaps, but not when the amount of real nutriment they contain is con- 
sidered. No other food can take their place at the same price. We give 
below three methods of preserving them. 

TO PRESERVE EGGS (METHOD No. i). 

Procure a new and clean wood box the size that will hold the quantity 
desired to pack away — and lay all over the bottom a layer of common 
salt about one inch thick. Now, have ready the eggs — fresh as fresh can 
be and pack them in rows placing the small ends down. When layer is 
complete put in salt until eggs are covered and then put on another layer 
of eggs. Continue until box is full, cover and put away In dry, cool, dark 
closet. If fresh eggs are put in, fresh eggs will come out. G P 

175 



176 EGGS. 

TO PRESERVE EGGS (METHOD No. 2). 

For every three gallons of water, put in one pint of fresh slacked lime 
and one-half pint of common salt; mix well, and let the crock be about 
one-half full of this fluid, then with a dish let down your eggs into it, tip- 
ping the dish after it fills with water, so they roll out without cracking the 
shell, for if the shell is cracked the &gg will spoil. Lay a piece of board 
across the tops of the eggs, and keep a little lime and salt upon it. They 
must always be kept covered with the brine. Be sure that eggs are fresh. 
If fresh, they will keep two and three years. This is the method sailors 

often use. C. S. F. 

TO PRESERVE EGGS (METHOD No. 3). 

Dissolve sufficient gum arable in water to make rather a thick liquid. 
Soon as possible after the eggs have been laid, coat them thoroughly with 
it, then place them in a box filled with powdered charcoal ; when required 
for use wash off the coating. Mrs. Mary Goodrich. 

EGGS COOKED WITHOUT BOILING. 

By this simple process eggs are lighter for delicate stomachs than by 
plunging them into boiling water. Heat a basin with boiling water till it 
is thoroughly hot ; then turn off the water and put the eggs to be cooked 
into it, moving them round so that every part shall receive the heat. 
Have ready a kettle of boiling water, pour this over the eggs, and cover 
the basin to prevent any steam from escaping. In twelve minutes they 
will be perfectly cooked. B. A. Cook. 

STEAMED EGGS. 

Break one-half dozen eggs into separate cups, and have ready a 
well-buttered dish, into which each ^gg should be placed carefully. Cover 
the dish to prevent the heat from escaping, and set it over a pan of boiling 
water, first putting small bits of butter lightly over the top of the eggs. 
When they are set sufficiently, sprinkle them with a little salt, and serve 
with fried ham or sausages. It takes four minutes to set. 

Mrs. Lyell. 
SOFT-BOILED EGGS. 

Put the eggs in boiling water and let boil for three minutes. Take 
them from the fire, and let stand in the water one minute to set the whites. 
Another way is to put the eggs into cold water, and leave them over the 
fire until the water boils, when the whites will be set.

EGOS A LA HAVANA. 

Take eight eggs, two ounces of butter, two small Spanish onions, six 
tomatoes, one-half teacupful of bread-crumbs, one-half pint of stock. 
Boil the eggs ten minutes, cut them into slices, chop the onions and toma- 
toes, season with pepper and salt, and fry them with the crumbs in the 
butter. Add the stock and stir for ten minutes after it boils. Place the slices 
of eggs in the liquid and warm them through. Mrs. Charlotte May. 

EGOS BAKED WITH ASPARAGUS. 

Cut two dozen stalks into inch pieces, using care in removing all the 
hard part; boil until tender in salted water, drain and put into a baking- 
dish; pour over them one cupful of drawn butter, break six eggs on the 
top, put a piece of butter on each one, and a light sprinkle of salt and pep- 
per, put in a quick oven and cook until the eggs are firm; serve at once. 

Mrs. Alice Heaton. 
DEVILED EGGS. 

Cut in two, crosswise, one dozen hard-boiled eggs. Remove the 
yolks carefully, mash them very fine and season sparely with mustard, 
vinegar, salt, pepper and a tablespoonful of melted butter. Chicken 
minced very fine may be added if desired. Be sure that the mixture is 
sufficiently moist and that it is not "lumpy." Fill the spaces in the whites 
of the eggs with the spiced yolks; smooth it even with top; sprinkle with 
chopped parsley; garnish with the same and serve cold. Excellent dish 
for picnic. Jane Bradley. 

EGGS SERVED IN CUPS. 

Butter the required number of cups, break an Qgg or two, as desired, 
into each one, salt to taste, then cover and place over the fire in a pan of 
boiling water. Let water boil until the eggs are sufficiently cooked. 
Serve in same cup. Teacups will answer the place of regular poachers if 
one has not the poachers at hand. Mrs, L. H. Roether. 

EGG BUTTER. 

To three well-beaten eggs add one pint of molasses, Orleans or 
eorghum. Boil until it thickens. Excellent Harriet Malott. 

EGGS EN MARINADE. 

Mix equal quantities of water and good meat gravy, two tablespoon- 
fuls of each with a teaspoonful of vinegar and a seasoning of pepper and 
salt; put it into a stew-pan and stir in gradually two well-beaten yolks of

eggs. When it thickens, and before it boils, have ready half a dozen 
nicely-poached eggs, and pour the sauce over them. Garnish with pars- 
ley. It takes ten minutes. Hannah Reynolds. 

DROPPED EGGS. 

Have the water in the saucepan boiling hard. Break gently the eggs, 
one at a time, into it, being very careful not to injure the yolks. With a 
spoon dip the hot water over them till a skin or crust has formed. Take 
them out with a skimmer, lay on a flat dish, slightly salting them, and

sable and can be used quite as elegantly by a gentleman as a lady. 

Perhaps you desire to ask what chafing dish to get — well, there are a 
number that are good but I prefer the one made by S. Sternan & Co. It 
is simple and is fitted out with the asbestos lamp, enabling one to increase 
or diminish the heat.

pan half filled with water; place the top pan in the lower one and all is 
ready for a dainty meal,

SALADS 



MEAT. FISH 
MADE OF AND 

SHELbFISH 



For vegetable salads, see Part II. 

SALADS of some kind have been used since 
the earliest times, but only within the last 
few years has the real salad grown into general 
favor. In ancient days salads were eaten as a 
sort of introduction to the heavier dishes that 
garnished the table; now, they are eaten after 
the meat course, or as the main course for the 
Sunday night supper. Like soups, salads are of 
two kinds: those made with meats and those made without. 
In order that each may come in its proper place we give here the recipes 
of only those salads which are made of meats. 

Meat of all kinds should be cut into small dice or picked apart with a 
fork and should be piled in fancy shapes on a platter — the mayonnaise 
then spread over them, after which they are garnished with tiny lettuce 
leaves, slices of lemon, hard-boiled eggs, capers, etc. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING (USUAL METHOD). 

Put the yolk of an egg into a cup with a salt-spoonful of salt, and beat 
until light; then add one-half teaspoonful of dry mustard and beat again. 
Then add olive oil, drop by drop, then a few drops of vinegar and the 
same of lemon juice. Continue this process until the egg has absorbed a 
little more than a gill of oil; finish by adding a very little cayenne pepper 
and sugar. English Cook. 

FRENCH DRESSING. 

One tablespoonful of vinegar, three of olive oil, one salt-spoonful of 
salt and one of pepper. French Cook. 

FAVORITE DRESSING. 

Take a yolk of a hard-boiled egg, rub it through a sieve and put into 
a bowl with the yolk of a raw ^^'g^ salt, pepper and a teaspoonful of pre- 
pared mustard; stir one way with a wooden spoon, adding slowly and 
alternately one gill of olive oil and two tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Finiisb 
with a tablespoonful of chopped herbs, parsley, celery tops and chives.

PASTRY, PIES 
and TARTS ^ m 



THE GREAT AMERICAN DISH 




THE making of pies in America has been 
developed almost to as fine an art as that 
of soup making in France. There is scarcely 
an article of food which has not been utilized 
in this unique way, and the future possibilities 
are only a question of time. 

GOOD PASTRY MAKING. 

It is said that successful pastry makers are born, not made, like really 
successful cooks. The sodden, pale, unsightly looking dough crusts that 
emerge from the ovens of many housewives would seem to justify this 
saying. Yet care and forethought will make a pastry maker, spite of that 
old saying. It requires simply good judgment and a deft touch. 

The quicker puff paste is made, the lighter it will be. The lard, but- 
ter or Ko-nut entering into its preparation should be ice cold, if possible, 
to insure that flaky crust which is so much liked. The hands should 
be cool when mixing it, and the pastry board should be of hard wood. 
Confectioners' paste is usually kneaded on marble slabs. 

HOW TO HEAT THE OVEN. 

Many err on account of the oven. They vow they have made the 
pastry quite right, but the oven has burnt it black or else cooked it a sickly 
white. This is because intelligence has not governed the heat of the oven 
aright or knowledge has not shown what is the heat suitable for pastry; 
therefore, guesswork has given the usual fatal results. 

A brisk oven is needed for all pastry. A very simple test will show 
the right heat. If the cook will insert a piece of white note paper into 
the oven and after five minutes take it out she will know what its heat is. 
A pale yellow hue on the paper will indicate that it is too slow for ordi- 
nary puff paste, a nice brown color, decided m tone, shows that the heat 
is just right, A very dark brown shows too much heat.

203 PASTRY, PIES AND TARTS. 

HOW TO OBTAIN GLOSS ON PIE CRUST. 

Even when the oven is quite right and the pastry has been made 
moderately rich a woman will feel dissatisfied at the appearance of a pif 
because she misses the rich brown gloss that she has seen on pastry made 
by practical cooks. To obtain this gloss she needs a wrinkle. It is pro- 
duced by egg-wash. An Qgg is beaten up with a little sugar and a small 
quantity of milk is added. With this wash the pie is brushed over after 
the pastry has been finished and all its paste ornaments have been put on. 
This is pastry-glazing. 

HOW TO UTILIZE ODDS AND ENDS OF PIE CRUST. 

If a little of the pie paste has been left over it should be converted 
into tea cakes, a little baking-powder, a few currants and some sugar 
effecting the transformation. Then the remainder of the &gg glaze will 
come in handy to brush over the small buns and none will be wasted. 
This wash is the secret of the rich brown on shop buns. 

VEGETABLE OIU-SUBSTITUTE FOR LARD. 

To those mothers who look upon pies as an abomination yet feel they 
must now and then meet the call we suggest the use of Ko-nut instead 
of lard, (see Part II.). Ko-nut, in a measure, does away with the objec- 
tionable feature — namely, indigestion. 

PUFF PASTE FOR PIES. 

One quart of flour, one pint of butter (not too salty) or butter and lard 
half and half, a pinch of salt, one and one-quarter cupfuls of cold water. 

Directions for Mixing Plain Puff Paste. — First sprinkle the salt 
in the flour and with the hand mix in quickly the shortening until 
all is smooth. Now mix in the cold water quickly as possible and 
roll out and fit to a pie plate — some butter the plate, I prefer not to, 
as a little flour on the crust is all that is needed to prevent the crust 
from sticking; cut off evenly around the edge of plate — gather up the 
scraps and make another sheet for the top of the pie and roll out the 
upper sheet a little thinner than the under crust, lap one half over the 
other and cut four or five small slits at the center (which enables the steam 
to escape). Now fill the pie with prepared filling, wet the edge of the rim 
to prevent the juices from running out, lay the upper crust across the cen- 
ter of the pie, turn back the half that is lapped, slightly press the edges 
aown with your thumb dipping occasionally into flour, to prevent sticking. 
Bake to a light brown. E. M. C.

PUFF PASTE— No. 2. 

For one pie take a heaping cupful of flour, one-half cupful of lard, a 
little salt, butter the size of a walnut and very cold water. 

Mrs. Eben. 
FINE PUFF PASTE. 

Two and one-half cupfuls of flour (always sifted), one cupful of butter, 
a pinch of salt, wash the hands with soap and water and dip them first in 
hot and then in cold water. Wash the butter in cold water, working it with 
the hands until it is light and waxy but not oily. This frees it from the salt 
and buttermilk and lightens it, so that the pastry is more delicate. Shape 
the butter into two thin cakes and put in a pan of ice-water to harden. 
Sift the salt with flour. With the hands, rub one-third of the shortening 
into the flour. Add the water. Stir quickly until the paste is smooth. 
Sprinkle the board lightly with flour Turn the paste on this. Roll from 
you and to one side; or, if you prefer to roll from you all the time, turn 
the paste around. When about one-fourth an inch thick, take the balance 
of the butter, break in bits and spread on the paste. Sprinkle lightly 
with flour. Now fold the paste, one-third from each side, so that the 
edges meet. Next fold from the ends, but do not have these meet. 
Double the paste, pound lightly and roll to about one-third of an inch in 
thickness. Fold as before and roll again. Put in ice-chest or cellar one 
hour to cool. As soon as cool, it will roll easily. The less flour used 
in rolling out the paste the tenderer it will be. Lillian. 

CREAHED PEACH PIE. 

Line a deep pie dish with rich pie crust and fill two-thirds full with 

slices of canned peaches that have been dropped into boiling syrup and 

cooked for two or three minutes. Cover with crust but do not pinch the 

edges. When rather cool, raise up the top crust and pour in the following 

cream, which should cool for a few moments before being poured in: One 

small cupful of milk, heated to boiling; one tablespoonful of sugar, one 

half teaspoonful of corn-starch wet in cold milk. Let boil, then add the 

white of one ^g'g beaten to a stiff froth and one-fourth of a teaspoonful 

of vanilla. C. P. O. 

RAI5IN PIE. 

(Excellent.) 

One cup of stoned raisins chopped fine, one lemon, grate rind, take 
out seeds and chop it fine with raisins; add one cup of sugar and two 
tablespoonfuls of water. This makes two pies; bake between upper and 
lower crusts. Mrs. Nancy Miller.

ORANGE PUFF5. 

Take out the pulp from two oranges; boil the peels until quite tender 

and then beat to a paste with twice their weight of sugar, then add the 

pulp and juice with a piece of butter the size of a walnut. Heat thes::^ 

ingredients well together. Line some pans with rich puff paste, put the 

mixture in and bake. When done beat the whites of three eggs to a firm 

froth, slightly sweeten, spread over and set in the oven to brown. 

Nannie Jones. 
POTATO PIE. 

Peel and grate one large white potato, add juice and grated rind of 
one lemon, the white of one Qg^ well beaten, one cupful of white sugar 
and one cup of cold water. Stir well together and pour into a pie tin with 
a rich under crust and bake. When done have ready the whites of two 
eggs well beaten, one-half teacupful of white sugar and one-half teaspoon- 
ful of lemon, all thoroughly beaten. Spread on the top of the pie evenly 
and return to the oven a few moments; a teaspoonful of jelly on the cen- 
ter of each piece ornaments it to a fancy degree,, This pie is sometimes 
called "silver pie," from its color. Jenette Tweed. 

APPLE AND RAISIN PIE. 

Two cups of tart apple sauce well sweetened, one-fourth of a tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon, one-half cup of seedless raisins boiled for ten min- 
utes, yolks of two eggs; mix and bake with an under crust. Make a 
meringue of the two whites slightly sweetened, arrange in fancy shape over 
pie and set in oven to harden. Miss Agnes Hyde. 

STRAWBERRY PIE. 

Line a pie plate with rich biscuit dough; prick the bottom to let out the 
air and bake. When cold fill with fresh ripe strawberries, well sprinkled 
with powdered sugar, spread over this a meringue made with the whites 
of two eggs and two tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; put in the oven 
just long enough to set but not cook the berries. Mrs. T. R. Duncan. 

RASPBERRY AND CURRANT PIE. 

Put a layer of red or black raspberries in the bottom of a deep pie 
tin, then a layer of red currants cleaned and stemmed, then another layer 
of raspberries, then currants, and proceed till the dish is full; sprinkle 
over one-half cupful of sugar and one-fourth of a cupful of water, put a 
thin layer of pie crust round the edge, then put on the top crust. Brush 
the top crust over with a little water and sift over a little granulated 
sugar. Bake in moderate oven one-half hour; the sugar gives it a frosted 
look. Be careful to watch it after it is in the oven so that it does not 
burn. M. E. J. 



PASTRY, PIES AND TARTS, 205 

OLD-FASHIONED APPLE PIE. 

An old-fashioned apple pie that appeals to all tastes is made in the 
following manner: After making a nice light crust and covering a deep 
pie tin with it, wet the edge with cold water and lay a very thin strip all 
around to keep the juice in. Then pare, core and slice tart apples and lay 
them in the dish with plenty of sugar and any spice that may be preferred, 
such as cinnamon, ground cloves and grated lemon rind with the lemon 
juice. If the fruit is not juicy enough, the peelings and cores may be 
boiled in a little sugar and flavoring and then strained and added to the 
fruit. Bake in a quick oven. Mrs. Nettie Wilson. 

GREEN APPLE PIE. 

Line a pie tin with rich paste, peel, core and slice enough tart apples 
to evenly fill the tin; sprinkle over about one cup of brown sugar, a tea- 
spoonful of cinnamon, a small level tablespoonful of sifted flour, two tabie- 
spoonfuls of water, a few bits of butter; cover with a top crust and bake 
about forty-five minutes. Annie Hull. 

DEEP APPLE OR PLUM PIE. 

Line a deep pie plate with pastry, place a layer of apples over this, 
and sprinkle with brown sugar. Then another layer of apple, with the 
sugar, until the pie plate is well filled and heaped in the middle. Over 
the top dot bits of butter; shake a pinch of salt over the whole. Wet the 
edge of the lower crust, sprinkle with flour, put on the upper crust, and 
press the edges firmly together. Bake a rich brown. Baldwin or Green- 
ing apples are the best, cut in thin slices; plums make a good pie, sen'ed 
in the same way. Mary Butts. 

ENGLISH APPLE PIE. 

Slice Northern Spy or Greenings very thin and fill a deep dish. Add 
one-fourth of a cup of water, two-thirds of a cup of brown sugar; bits of 
butter, a sprinkle of salt and a grating of lemon. Cover top with a good 
puff paste, being sure to wet the edges of the dish. To be eaten warm 
with cream and sugar; very appetizing. Lulu Rounds. 

NEW ENGLAND APPLE PIE. 

Place a border of plain or puff paste around a basin or deep pie dish, 
put an Qgg cup reversed in the center, and fill with tart apples, pared, 
cored and sliced. Sweeten with one cup of sugar and season with cinna- 
mon or nutmeg. Cover with a crust and bake in a hot oven for from one- 
half to three-quarters of an hour. Mrs. BowermaNo

APRICOT CUSTARD PIE. 

Line a pie dish with a rich crust. Spread smoothly at the bottom a 

layer of apricot marmalade an inch thick, and pour over it a custard made 

of a pint of new milk, three eggs and a teaspoonful of ground rice, a little 

sugar, and four drops of the essence of almonds. Bake in a quick oven 

about fifteen minutes. Julia Hoff. 

BANANA CREAM PIE. 

Line a pie pan with crust and bake in a hot oven. When done, 
cover the bottom with slices of banana cut lengthwise, very thin. (Two 
small bananas are enough for one pie.) Then fill the pan with a custard 
made in the following manner: Two glasses of milk, two tablespoonfuls 
of corn-starch dissolved in a little milk, yolks of two eggs and one tea- 
spoonful of vanilla extract. Boil in a double boiler until it thickens; then 
pour it into the pie crust. Cover the top with the whites of the eggs 
beaten stiff and slightly sweetened. Place in the oven just long enough 

to give it a rich brown color. Ella N. Mitchell. 

CHERRY PIE. 

Line pie plate with good crust, fill it generously half full with ripe, 
stoned cherries; sprinkle over them a good cupful of sugar and a tea- 
spoonful of sifted flour. Dot over a few tiny bits of butter; now fill the 
crust to the top with cherries; cover with the upper crust and bake. Very 

good, ir.deed. Amy McCall. 

CREAM PRUNE PIE. 

Foi two pies, wash and stew two cups of prunes, then rub through a 

colander. Add three cupfuls of sweet cream, the beaten yolks of three 

eggs, one and one-half cupfuls of sugar, the beaten whites of the eggs and

beaten whites of two eggs and two tablespoonfuls of sugar. Flavor with 

pineapple. Louise Hull. 

APPLE CUSTARD PIE. 

Three cups of milk, four eggs and one cup of sugar, two cups of thick 
stewed sour apples strained through a colander. Beat the whites and 
yolks of the eggs, separately, and mix the yolks well with the apples,

of corn-starch dissolved in milk. When cooked pour into a pie shell 
previously baked. Put a meringue on top. S. C. P. 

HUCKLEBERRY PIE. 

Pick out all the stems and wash one quart of berries; line a pie dish 
with paste, put in the berries two-thirds of an inch deep; cover with two- 
thirds of a teacupful of brown sugar; sprinkle a teaspoonful of flour over, a 
little salt; cover the pie, cut a slit in the center, press the two crusts

half of an inch, cover with strips of crust and bake; very good. 

F. R. A. 
CURRANT PIE. 

Butter a pie plate and line with rich paste rolled quite thin; fill with 
ripe, red currants not previously cooked; sprmkle plentifully with sugar, 
dredge in a little flour, and put in two tablespoonfuls of water; wet the 
edge of the paste and cover with top crust, slit in center, press the edges 
well together and bake forty minutes. Green currant pie is excellent 
made the same way with a little additional sugar. H. E. R. 

LEMON PIE (PLAIN). 

Bake to a nice brown an under crust made of Ko-nut, not lard — see 
Part II. — and fill with the following dressing: One pint of water put on 
the stove in a double boiler; add a pinch of salt, butter the size of a wal- 
nut, one full cup of sugar, yolk of one &gg, and juice of one lemon. Let it 
come to a boil and stir in a little corn-starch previously dissolved in cold 
water, only thick enough for a rich cream. Spread over with the white 
of one ^gg beaten to a stiff froth and slightly sweetened. Place in the 
oven to brown. This is a plain, healthy, and easily made pie. It will hurt 
no one. H. U. B.

LEMON PIE— No. 2. 

A lemon pie that is just rich enough to be enjoyable, is made by put- 
ting the crust intended for it into a deep plate. Stir one tablespoonful of 
corn-starch into a little cold water, add a cup of boiling water, let all boil, 
then add seven tablespoonfuls of sugar, the well-beaten yolks of four 
eggs and the grated rind and the juice of two lemons and bake. While 
this pie is baking beat the whites of the four eggs and one heaping table- 
spoonful of pulverized sugar to a stiff froth; when the pie is baked spread 
this smoothly over the top, then set in the oven for two or three minutes; 
this is long enough to give it the desired golden brown color. 

May Johnson. 
LEHON PIE— No. 3. 

For two pies grate the rinds and use the juice of three large lemons, 
stir one-half cup of butter and two cups of sugar to a cream, then add 
four eggs well beaten, then the lemons beat well again, and bake with an 
under crust. Mrs. S. D. Hillier. 

SLICED LEMON PIE. 

Line a pie plate with rich pie crust, then put in a cup of sugar. Pare 
one large lemon or two small ones, taking care to leave none of the white 
rind. Slice very thin, removing all seeds. Put on a top crust, with a fork 
puncture holes in top, pinching down edges well, so that the juice does not 
escape. Bake fifteen minutes. Serve cold. Mrs. John R. Clute. 

CHOCOLATE CREAM PIE. 

Heat one pint of milk to scalding, add one-third of a cake of Baker's 
chocolate, beat the yolks of four eggs with one coffee-cupful of sugar, then 
add the milk and the whites of the eggs last. Flavor with vanilla. A 
puff paste should be made for this and previously baked. 

Mabel Sanderson. 
PINEAPPLE PIE. 

Take a large pineapple, pare and grate it, add to it one-half pound 

of sugar, one cup of butter, a small glass of wine, one tablespoonful of 

rose water, a little grated nutmeg; mix all together, adding a few cracker 

crumbs, then bake with two crusts, like an apple pie.

the juice of one orange. Line a dish with pastry; add the mixture and 
bake twenty minutes. Just before serving, sift powdered sugar over it. 

Mrs. Merinda Clay. 

STEWED SQUASH OR PUMPKIN FOR PIES. 

Medium, deep-colored pumpkins are the best. Cut in half, remove 

the seeds, then cut up in thick slices, pare the outside and cut again in 

small pieces. Put one-half of it into a granite saucepan with a very little 

water; let cook slowly until tender. Now set the pan on the back of the 

stove and cook slowly, stirring often until the moisture is dried out and 

the pumpkin looks dark and red. It requires cooking at least half a day 

to have it dry and rich. When cool press through a colander. As only 

one-half of the pumpkin is required the other half can be dried and used 

at some future time. E. V. A. 

PUMPKIN PIE. 

(Like Mother Makes.) 

One quart of milk, three small cupfuls of boiled and strained pump- 
kin, one and one-half cupfuls of brown sugar, one-half cupful of molasses, 
the yolks and whites of three eggs beaten separately, a little salt, one 
level tablespoonful each of ginger and cinnamon. Beat all together and 
bake with an under crust; enough for three pies. Hubbard squash may 
be substituted for pumpkin if latter is not at hand. Amy Brooks. 

SQUASH PIE. 

Add two cups of milk to four and one-quarter cups of sifted squash. 
Use five eggs, one and one-half cups of brown sugar and one-half of a 
nutmeg, grated, with a teaspoonful of cinnamon; salt to taste. Bake on 
single crust three-quarters of an hour. Mrs. Sally Bowles. 

DATE PIE. 

Soak one pound of dates over night in a little water and stew them in 
the same the next morning until soft enough to strain through a colan- 
der; add one quart of rich milk, three well-beaten eggs, a pinch of salt, 
butter size of a walnut and four or five gratings of nutmeg. Bake with 
an under crust. This quantity is sufficient for three pies. Icing may be 

made for the top. Ida M. Baxter. 

PRUNE PIE. 

Stew and mash through the colander a pound of prunes, one cup of 
pulp; add one cup of thin, sweet cream, a teaspoonful of corn-starch 
rubbed smooth in a little cold milk, the yolks of two well-beaten eggs and 
one-third of a cup of sugar. Put in two spoonfuls of apricot, peach or 
pear juice for flavor; line a pie plate with crust, fill with the mixture and

bake quickly. Do not burn. Beat with the whites two tablespoonfuls of 

powdered sugar and spread over the top of the pie, brown lightly. 

Mrs. B. Melendy. 
PEACH OR PLUM PIE. 

Peel, stone and slice good flavored peaches. Line a pie plate with 

crust and lay in the fruit, sprinkling sugar liberally over in proportion to 

the sweetness of the peach. Dot with butter; add a very little water 

and bake with an upper crust, or with cross-bars of paste across the top. 

Julia T. Tibbitts. 
nOCK CHERRY PIE. 

One cupful of cranberries; prick each one with a fork to keep them 
from cooking to pieces, one cupful of sugar, one-half cupful of water and 
one tablespoonful of flour wet in a little of the water. Stir all together 
and bake between two crusts. Mrs. Orval Townsend. 

VINEGAR PIE. 

Line pie tin with good crust; take three tablespoonfuls of flour, one 

teacupful of sugar and mix well. Now add three-quarters of a cupful of 

good vinegar and one-quarter of a cup of water; flavor with nutmeg and 

cover with strips of crust. Lay on bits of butter and bake in a moderate 

oven. L. A. Gregg. 

MOCK MINCE PIE. 

Take two cupfuls of sugar, one cup of fine bread-crumbs, one cup of 
water, one-half cupful of vinegar, one-half pound of chopped raisins, a 
piece of butter the size of an egg, one teaspoonful each of cinnamon and 
nutmeg. Make a good crust for it. Hattie King.

inch deep, a large teacupful of sugar, sprinkle with salt, shake over a 
little flour, cover with a crust, slit in the center, trim off the edge and 
bake in a quick oven until done. Rhubarb pies made in this way are 
altogether superior to those made of the fruit stewed N. E. L.

RHUBARB PIE (STEWED). 

Stew and sweeten fruit to taste. Line a dish with paste; brush the 
paste over with the beaten white of an egg to keep it from becoming 
soggy. Put only one-half cup of water to a two-quart saucepan of the 
rhubarb in stewing, or it will be too juicy. Fill the dish three-quarters 
full, put strips of paste across as for a tart pie, and bake in a quick oven 
until the crust is done. Katharine. 

GOOSEBERRY PIE. 

Line a deep dish and fill with ripe or green gooseberries, regulating 
the quantity of sugar you use by their sweetness (one cup at least); sift 
over this a small teaspoonful of flour, add a very little butter, then cover 
with a crust and bake. R. A. B. 

CUSTARD PIE. 

Beat three eggs well, add one pint of milk, a little nutmeg grated, one- 
half cup of sugar and any flavor to suit, though vanilla is the best. There 
is a perforated pie plate made which is especially suited to custard pies, as 
the steam escapes and prevents the pie becoming soggy. The crust may 
be baked light brown before adding the custard. Pricking the dough 
before baking prevents blistering. Mrs. James Morrison. 

CUSTARD PIE— No. 2. 

Six eggs, one and one-half cupfuls of sugar, one cupful of butter, six 
tablespoonfuls of corn-starch or flour and three cups of milk; flavor to 
taste. This is sufficient for three pies; bake with one crust only.

CUSTARD TARTLETS. 

Line some patty pans with a good crust. Make a custard, flavor it 
nicely, and three-parts fill the pans with custard. Bake the tartlets in a 
gentle oven. Take them out, let them cool, and spread a little sugar 
icing over them. Strew a little more sugar on the top, and bake them in 
a gentle oven until the icing is crisp. If a richer tartlet is wanted, a little 
jam may be put over the custard. Time: about one-quarter of an hour 
to bake the tartlets. F. E. R. 

CREAn PIE. 

One cup of sweet milk, one cup (large) sugar, yolks of three eggs, 
butter the size of an &gg, one tablespoonful of flour. Boil until it thick-

RASPBERRY, CHERRY OR GOOSEBERRY TURNOVERS. 

Take a good light crust, roll it out two or three times, then leave it 
Dne-quarter of an inch in thickness. Cut it out in rounds with a small 
basin, and lay a few black raspberries, cherries or gooseberries, which 
have been stewed with sugar, on one-half of each round. Turn the other 
half over the fruit, fasten the edges securely, and bake on tins in a moder- 
ate oven. Serve with sifted sugar. Mrs. C. I. Burt. 

CHEESE PIE. 

One teacupful of sour milk curd slightly salted, two eggs, three-

with the other ingredients. Bake in a deep pie tin lined with rich crust. 
Powder with cinnamon. Mrs. Mary C. Bartlett. 

TARTS. 

Small, round, heart-shaped or oblong shallow pans are required for 
tarts proper. Line with paste and bake; when cool fill with jam or pre- 
serve, or meringue. A few stars or leaves or strips of paste criss-crossed 
are placed on the top of fruit tarts. Dried fruit, stewed until thick, makes 
fine tarts; pineapple and chocolate cream fillings are fine.

HOW-TO 

MAKETHEN 



TO INSURE success in cake, cooky and doughnut making, use none 
but the best ingredients, and have all the materials ready before 
commencing to mix them. The flour should be sifted, then measured, 
the cream of tartar or the baking-powder should be well incorporated 
with the flour, butter should be soft but not melted and if too salty, rinse 
two or more times with cold water, sugar (pulverized, never granulated) 
should be sifted, eggs fresh and thoroughly cold, spices ground, raisins 
seeded and currants stemmed, washed and thoroughly dried. 

HOW TO PUT A CAKE TOGETHER. 

The following rule of putting a cake together, never fails. Work the 
butter and sugar to a cream, beat the whites and yolks of eggs separately 
(the whites to a stiff froth, the yolks to a cream), then add yolks to the 
creamed butter and sugar, afterwards add the milk, then the flavoring, 
next the whites of the eggs, and lastly the flour, by degrees. If fruit is 
added, dredge flour over it, stirring it in slowly and thoroughly before the 
flour. Where the recipe calls for baking-powder and you are out of it, 
use soda and cream of tartar in the proportion of one level teaspoonful of 
soda to two heaping teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar. Sift the cream of 
tartar into the flour, dissolve the soda in a teaspoonful of boiling water, 
adding it to the cake before adding the whites of the eggs. When sour 
milk is used, always use soda, not baking-powder. If soda and sour milk 
are called for — sweet milk and baking-powder can be substituted by using 
two and one-half teaspoonfuls of baking-powder to a quart of flour. 
Avoid stirring cake after the sugar and butter are creamed, but beat from 
the bottom, up and over. 

HOW TO BAKE A CAKE. 

Cake pans should be lined with buttered writing paper. To test the 
cake when baking, insert a broom straw — if not sticky, the cake is done. 
Do not open the oven door often. It reduces the temperature and causes 
the cake to fall. A small dish of water in the oven will prevent scorching. 
This is particularly necessary in gas-range ovens. Another good way to 
avoid burning is to lay a thin sheet of tin on the bottom of the oven and 
a piece of buttered brown oaoer over the top of the cake.

216 CAKES. 

PLAIN FROSTING OR ICINQ FOR CAKES. 

The quickest way of beating eggs to a stiff froth is to put them in a 
large cup and use the "dover beater." Some still prefer to use a platter 
and a silver fork. Either way is good. Above all things the eggs should 
be cold, and the dish on which, or in which, they are to be beaten should 
also be cold. Allow, for the white of one ^gg, one small teacupful of 
powdered sugar. Break the eggs, putting on them a small pinch of salt, 
then throw a small handful of sugar on them and begin beating at once; 
keep adding sugar at intervals until it is all used up. The eggs must not 
be beaten until the sugar has been added in this way, which gives a 
smooth, tender frosting and one that will dry readily. 

Spread with a broad knife evenly over the cake. If it seems too thin, 
beat in a little more sugar. If desired the cake can be covered with two 
coats, the second after the first has become dry. If the icing gets too 
dry before the last coat is added it can be thinned with a little water, 
enough to make it work smoothly. 

The flavors mostly used for icing are strawberry, lemon, vanilla, 
almond, rose, chocolate, pineapple and orange. To ornament with figures 
or flowers, make up extra icing, keep about one-third out until that on the 
cake is dried; then, with a clean glass syringe, apply it in such forms as 
desired and dry as before; what is kept out to ornament with may 
be tinted pink with strawberry, blue with huckleberry juice, yellow with 
orange (using the grated rind of an orange strained through a cloth), 
green with'spinach juice and brown with chocolate, purple with grape juice. 
Currant, raspberry and cranberry juices color a delicate pink. 

Saffron, indigo and cochineal can be used for coloring yellow, blue 
and red instead of the fruits, but the former is much nicer and more 
healthful. 

FROSTING OR ICINQ (BOILED). 

Two cups of sugar and water to moisten. Let stand till it dissolves; 
boil slowly without stirring until it threads from the spoon. Beat the 
whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, when syrup is slightly cooled, stir in 
gradually, and beat until cold; season to taste with vanilla, lemon or what 
you prefer. C. Clements. 

DATE, RAISIN OR FIG ICINQ. 

Fruits chopped and added to the above icing substituted in place of 
the whites of eggs is a most palatable change.

LEMON FROSTING. 

Take the juice of two lemons and add to it powdered sugar until thick 
enough to spread. Pour over top of cake and smooth with thin bladed 
knife which has been dipped in water. A. P. V. 

PLAIN VANILLA ICING. 

Break the white of one large ^g^ into a bowl and gradually beat into 
it one cupful of confectioners' sugar. Beat for three minutes, add one- 
half teaspoonful of vanilla extract and spread thinly on the cakes, 

Maria Parloa. 
PLAIN CHOCOLATE ICING. 

Make a vanilla icing, and add one tablespoonful of cold water to it. 
Scrape fine one ounce of chocolate and put it in a small iron or granite- 
ware saucepan, with two tablespoonfuls of confectioners' sugar and one 
tablespoonful of hot water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy, 
then add another tablespoonful of hot water. Stir the dissolved choco- 
late into the vanilla icing. Maria Parloa. 

GLAC6 ICING. 
See Chocolate Glac6 Cake. 

COCOA FROSTING. 

Four teaspoonfuls of cocoa, two tablespoonfuls of cold water, three 
tablespoonfuls of hot water, one-half teaspoonful of vanilla, about one and 
three-fourth cups of confectioners' sugar. Put the cocoa in a small sauce- 
pan; add the cold water and stir until perfectly smooth, then the hot 
water, and cook for one or two minutes; add vanilla and a speck of salt, 
then stir in enough sugar to make it stiff enough to spread nicely. Beat 
until smooth and glossy and free from lumps. If too thick add a little 
cold water. If not thick enough add a little sugar. Never make a frost- 
ing so stiff that it will have to be made smooth with a wet knife. It is 
better to let it run to the sides of the cake. For frosting sides of the 
cake make a little stiffen This frosting never cracks as an &^g frosting 
but is hard enough to cut nicely. Miss Elizabeth K. Burr. 

CHOCOLATE AND WHITE ICING. 

Put into a granite-ware saucepan two gills of sugar and one-half of

water in a small saucepan. Stir over the fire until the sugar is nearly melted.

it would spoil the icing if the syrup were stirred after it begins to boil. After

but do not stir; then set away to cool. When the syrup is about blood 
warm, beat it with a wooden spoon until thick and white. Now put the

BRIDE CAKE. 

As weddings are always in style, and as a cake made at home is not 
only more inexpensive, but also more desirable from the fact that the 
prospective bride usually compounds it, we give a very carefully prepared 
recipe for that purpose. This cake improves by being made some time 
beforehand. The following ingredients are necessary: One and one-half 
pounds of flour, one and one-half pounds of butter, one-half pound of 
candied lemon, one-half pound of candied orange, one-half pound of can- 
died citron, one pound of dried cherries, one and one-half pounds of dried 
currants (if the cherries are not used, take two and one-half pounds of 
currants instead), eight ounces of almonds, eight eggs, the rind of four 
oranges or of two lemons rubbed upon sugar, one-half ounce of spices, 
consisting of powdered cinnamon, grated nutmeg, and powdered cloves in 
equal proportions, one teaspoonful of salt and a small tumbler of brandy. 
If objected to, the brandy may be omitted, and another Qgg may be 
added. Wash, pick, and dry the currants, cut the cherries into moderate- 
sized pieces, slice the candied peel into thin shreds, blanch and pound the 
almonds, or cut them into very small pieces, and crush the flavored sugar 
to powder. Put the butter into a large bowl, and beat it to a cream, either 
with a wooden spoon or with the hand. Add very gradually the sugar, 
flour, and eggs, and when they are thoroughly mixed work in the rest of 
the ingredients, a little at a time, and beat the cake between every addi- 



226 CAKES. 

tion. Beat it three-quarters of an hour. Line a tin hoop with double 
folds of buttered paper, pour in the mixture, and place it on a metal bak- 
ing-sheet with twelve folds of paper under it, and four or five on the top, 
to keep it from burning. Put it in a moderately heated oven and keep 
the oven at an even temperature until it is done. 

If the cake is to be iced, first prepare the almond part: Take one-half 
pound of almonds, throw them into boiling water, and skin them. Pound 
them in a mortar with a few drops of orange-flower water, one pound of 
fine white sugar, and as much white of egg as will make a soft stiff paste. 
Spread this over the top of the cake and keep it from the edge as much 
as possible. Put it in a cool oven, or in a warm place, till it is dry and 
hard. To make the sugar icing, put two pounds of icing sugar into a 
bowl and work into it the whites of two, or if necessary three, or even 
four, eggs. The whites must not be whisked, but thrown in as they are. 
Work the mixture to a stiff shiny paste, and whilst working it add occa- 
sionally a drop of lemon juice. Be careful to obtain icing sugar. If a 
drop of liquid blue is added it will look whiter. The icing needs to be 
worked vigorously to make a paste which will not run, and the fewer eggs 
used the better. The cake should not be iced until a short time before it 
is wanted, as it may become soiled. Spread the icing evenly over with 
hands wet with cold water, then smooth with an ivory knife, and put 
it in gentle oven to harden. Ornament the cake with little knobs of icing 
placed round the edge; and on the day of the wedding a wreath of white 
flowers and ^reen leaves may be placed round it by way of beautifying, 
or any more elaborate ornamentation that may suggest itself.

EASTER CAKELETS. 

Make a silver cake after the silver cake recipe; spread about one- 
half inch thick on flat baking-tin and bake. When done, let partially 
cool, then take out of tin and lay on flat surface. Also make the gold 
cake after the gold cake recipe, at the same time adding a little yellow 
vegetable coloring if the color of the batter is not deep enough to represent 
the yolk of an &gg. Then spread it about one-half inch thick on a tin. 
When baked, remove from tin and lay also on flat surface. Now, with a 
round cooky cutter, cut out the white cake, laying each piece again on a 
flat surface. With a smaller cooky cutter cut out the yellow cake, laying 
each piece in the center and on top of each round white cake. Boiled

CHOCOLATE ECLAIRS. 

Into a granite-ware saucepan put one-half pint of milk, two well- 
rounded tablespoonfuls of butter and one tablespoonful of sugar and place 
on the stove. When this boils up, add one-half pint of sifted flour and 
cook for two minutes, beating well with a wooden or granite spoon. It 
will be smooth and velvety at the end of that time. Set away to cool; and 
when cool, beat in four eggs, one at a time. Beat vigorously for about 
fifteen minutes. Try a small bit of the paste in the oven, if it rises 
in the form of a hollow ball the paste is beaten enough, whereas, if it 
does not, beat a little longer. Have tin sheets or shallow pans slightly 
buttered. Have ready, also, a tapering tin tube, with the smaller opening 
about three-quarters of an inch in diameter. Place this in the small end 
of a conical cotton pastry bag. Put the mixture in the bag, and press out 
on buttered pans, having each eclair nearly three inches long. There 
should be eighteen, and they must be at least two inches apart, as they 
swell in cooking. Bake in a moderately hot oven for about twenty-five 
minutes. Take from the oven and while they are still warm coat them

the following described preparations: 

Filling No. i. — Mix in a bowl one-half pint of rich cream, one tea- 
spoonful of vanilla and four tablespoonfuls of sugar. Place the bowl in a 
pan of ice-water and beat the cream until light and firm, using either an 
egg-beater or a whisk. 

Filling No. 2. — Put one-half pint of milk in the double boiler and 
place on the fire. Beat together until very light one level tablespoonful 
of flour, one-half cupful of sugar and one ^gg; when the milk boils, stir in 
this mixture. Add one-eighth of a teaspoonful of salt and cook for fifteen 
minutes, stirring often. When cold flavor with one teaspoonful of vanilla. 

Icing for Eclairs.— Put in a small granite-ware pan one-half pint of 
sugar and five tablespoonfuls of cold water. Stir until the sugar is 
partially melted and then place on the stove, stirring for one-half minute. 
Take out the spoon, and watch the sugar closely. As soon as it boils take 
instantly from the fire and pour upon a meat platter. Let this stand for 
eight minutes. Meantime, shave into a cup one ounce of chocolate and 
put it on the fire in a pan of boiling water. At the end of eight minutes 
stir the sugar with a wooden spoon until it begins to grow white and to 
thicken. Add the melted chocolate quickly and continue stirring until 
the mixture is thick. Put it in a small saucepan and place on the fire in 
another pan of hot water. Stir until so soft that it will pour freely. 
Stick a skewer into the side of an eclair and dip the top in the hot choco- 
late. Place on a plate and continue until all the eclairs are "glaced." 
They will dry quickly. Do not stir the sugar after the first one-half min- 
ute and do not scrape the sugar from the saucepan into the platter. All 
the directions must be strictly followed. Maria Parloa.

PUDDING 
-SAUCES 



m^ TN MAKING puddings or dumplings the first matter of impor- 
' i- tance is to see that all the ingredients are fresh and good. The 
slightest taint will injure the whole pudding. Puddings are of three kinds 
— boiled, steamed, and baked. To steam a pudding, put it into a buttered 
tin pan or granite dish; tie a cloth over the top, first dredging it in flour 
and set into a steamer. Covet the steamer closely; allow a little longer 
time than you do for boiling. Boiling requires nearly twice the time 
required for baking. 

Attention to the turning out of a pudding, so that it shall not be 
ragged or broken, is necessary. Puddings that are to be boiled should be 
put into plenty of boiling water, and kept at a steady boil. A baked pud- 
ding should be stirred once or twice after it has set, so that the fruit may 
not all sink to the bottom, while one that is boiled should be turned over 
for the same reason, and also to keep it from sticking to the bottom of 
the kettle. On removing a pudding tied in a cloth, plunge it quickly into 
a basin of cold water and it will readily separate. If there is much bread 
in the pudding, tie it rather loosely, to allow for its swelling, but a batter 
pudding cannot be fastened too lightly. An ^^^ that is not strictly fresh 
must never be used. Salt should be added, in a small quantity, to all 
puddings. 

The oven must be regularly washed, and the juice of pies, meats, etc., 
that have escaped in cooking scraped off. A pudding is lighter when 
boiled than when baked. Puddings will turn out of a basin well if it has 
been plentifully rubbed with butter. 

If cloths are used, do not wash them with soap, unless well rinsed 
afterwards. Just before filling dip them into boiling water, saueeze them 
dry and dredge them with flour. 

HOW TO CLEAN CURRANTS. 

Put the required amount of currants in a colander and sprinkle with 
flour; rub them well until they are separated, and the flour and fine stems 
have passed through the strainer. Place the currants in a pan of cold 
water and wash thoroughly; strain and dry between clean towels. It 
hardens them to dry in an oven Woman's Exchange

HOW TO CHOP SUET. 

Take suet, when very cold break or cut in small pieces, sprinkle with 
sifted flour and chop quickly before it gets soft and sticky. 

Woman's Exchange. 

HOW TO STONE RAISINS. 

Put the desired number in a dish and pour boiling water over them; 
cover and let remain ten minutes; this will soften so that the seeds will 
come out easily with a small knife. Woman's Exchange. 

POP CORN PUDDING. 

(Delicious.) 

Take five quarts of popped corn and crush with a rolling pin, run it 
through a coffee mill to make it fine; this will make five pints of coarse 
meal. Mix this with four pints of sweet milk and set it on the back of the 
stove to soak for two hours or more. Then add two eggs, sugar, raisins 
and spices to taste; put on the hot stove and boil for a few minutes, stir- 
ring well to mix the meal with the milk; bake about one hour and serve 
hot. Mrs. J. H. T. 

HOLIDAY PUDDING. 

Six ounces of malaga raisins, two ounces of orange peel, one-quarter 
of a pound of macaroons, five pounds of eggs, one tablespoonful of corn- 
starch, two cupfuls of milk, one teaspoonful of vanilla, four tablespoonfuls 
of sugar. In the cake mold put a row of raisins and bits of preserved 
orange peel, then a row of macaroons, then a row of raisins, and so on, 
the last being a row of macaroons. Don't fill the mold. Make a sauce 
of five eggs, corn-starch, milk and sugar, and mix the whole. Pour this 
sauce into the mold, put in a pan of hot water and bake in an oven not too 
warm. Knock out the pudding and serve with the following sauce: 

Sauce. — Beat together two yolks of eggs, one teaspoonful of corn-

PLUn PUDDING. 

Take one quart can of large ^^^ plums, leave out the juice and 
put into an ordinary sized pudding dish. Pour over it the following ingre- 
dients, well mixed: Three eggs, two cupfuls of sugar, one-half cupful of 
butter, one cupful of sweet milk, two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder and 
enough flour to make a stiff batter. Bake forty-five minutes Now take 



PUDDINGS AND PUDDING SAUCES. gftl 

the juice of the plums and one-half cupful of sugar and boil three minutes 
and serve as a sauce. The latter can be thickened with a little corn- 
starch if desired. Miss Clara Stice. 

ENGLISH PLUn PUDDING. 

Take one and one-half pounds of suet, one and one-half pounds of 
dry light brown sugar, one and one-half pounds of currants washed and 
dried thoroughly, one and one-half pounds of raisins, four nutmegs grated 
and sifted through a small tea strainer and thoroughly mixed, so they will 
not be lumpy; one-quarter of a pound of candied lemon peel, one-quarter 
of a pound of citron, one heaping teaspoonful of fine salt, mixed in the 
same way as the nutmegs, baker's bread enough to make a quantity equal 
in bulk to the suet. Use only the crumb of the loaf, rejecting the crust. 
It will take nearly one and one-half loaves of ordinary size, one-half pint 
of flour, nine eggs beaten very light and milk enough to wet the mixture. 
Chop the suet first, then add the bread-crumbs, sliced citron and peel, 
raisins and currants. Sift the salt and nutmegs in, stirring thoroughly. 
Next add the sugar and next sift in the flour. Then pour in the eggs, 
mixing thoroughly as before. Now comes the milk. You only need 
suflicient milk to wet the pudding about as moist as mince meat for pies 
should be made. Then butter your tin basin well, put in your pudding, 
leaving room for a stiff batter of flour and water which must be spread 
over the whole top of the pudding to exclude the air and water. Then 
take stout, unbleached cotton, tie it firmly over the top, round the rim of 
the basin, and bring the corners that hang down back again over the top, 
pinning them securely. Then put the pudding into boiling water and let 
it boil without cessation, eleven hours. The best way is to make them two 
or three days before needed, and then put them on again the day they 
are to be eaten, and boil from two to three hours more. A pudding 
prepared and cooked in this way is "fit to set before a king." Use cold 
sauce made of sugar, butter and wine, or hot brandy sauce. These pud- 
dings will keep a year. Annie R. White.

HUCKLEBERRY PUDDING. 

Huckleberry pudding is quite an institution at our house. Make a 
crust of flour and nice beef suet, about three-quarters of a pound of the 
suet after it is shredded and chopped fine to one quart of sifted flour. A 
little salt is added, and it is wet to a paste with very cold water. Then 
roll the crust out quite thin, lay berries — a goodly quantity of them — on, 
bringing the edges of the crust together, lapping and pinching them so 
that the berries do not escape. Tie the pudding up in a cloth and boil 
till done. Then remove the pudding from the cloth and lay it on a plat- 
ter. Cut a square hole and pour in a coffee-cupful of syrup, replace the 
piece of crust and bring the pudding to the table. Syrup for sweetening 
is better than sugar, because it makes it juicier. Use a plain sauce with 
this pudding, made of a very little sugar, flour, butter and water, flavored 
with a teacupful of huckleberries crushed. Let come to a boil.

Scrape the chocolate. When the milk boils, add the corn-starch, salt and 
chocolate and cook for ten minutes. Beat the yolks of the eggs with 
three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Pour the hot mixture on this and beat

DELICIOUS APPLE DUHPLINQS. 

Chop one pound of suet very fine. Add a little salt and flour enough 
to make a dough, when wet up with cold water. Knead this as little as 
possible — only enough to roll out and cut. Pare, core and quarter tart 
apples. Cover each apple with dough, pressing it together so it will not 
burst open and wrap white cloth about it, first wetting the cloth in hot 
water. Pin each dumpling tightly up and drop it into boiling water. Do 
not let them cease boiling until done. An hour's time is ample. Make a 
sweet sauce for them or eat butter and sugar upon them.

ETC 




FOR SUMMER, light- desserts take the preference. 
Custards are light and dainty and quite appropriate 
after a hearty meal. Good custard can be made in the 
proportion of five eggs to each quart of rich milk. There 
are three ways of cooking custard — baking, boiling or 
steaming. A baked custard, we believe, has the prefer- 
ence, and to insure the best results, the temperature of 
the oven must be exactly right. It must be a good heat 
and kept regular. If the custard remains too long in the 
oven itwill whey and its nicety be destroyed. The whites and yolks of the 
eggs in a custard should be beaten separately. The sugar should be 
added to the beaten yolks and then be beaten again. Add the whites next, 
then the flavoring, and lastly, the cold milk. 

Pastry and puddings seem to tire the appetite in summer and these 
light and palatable desserts are then enjoyed to the full extent. Many of 
the desserts can be made of canned fruit and are as nice as though con- 
cocted from fresh fruit. 

CUP CUSTARD. 

Beat four eggs light, add one-half cupful of granulated sugar, a little 
salt, one quart of milk, and one-eighth of a teaspoonful of grated nutmeg. 
Stir until the sugar is dissolved. Put the custard in five cups, place in a 
pan of boiling water, and then put the pan in the oven. Bake till firm 
in the center; no longer, or they will become watery. When done stand 
away to get cold. Serve them in the cups. Lillie. 

MICHIGAN CUSTARD. 

Beat five eggs thoroughly, then stir into them one cupful of maple 
sugar, one tablespoonful of flour, a pinch of salt, one-eighth of a nutmeg. 
Stir this all into two quarts of lukewarm milk. Pour in baking dish and 
set baking dish in pan of hot water. Bake in moderate oven until custard 
^'s firm ill the center. Mrs. John Irish.

sifted sugar. This is a nice hot dessert. Mrs. Ellen Sullivan. 

BAKED CHOCOLATE CUSTARD.

mon about one inch long. Put the cinnamon and milk in the double 
boiler, place on the fire, and cook for ten minutes. Shave the chocolate 
and put it in a small pan with three tablespoonfuls of sugar and one 
tablespoonful of boiling water. Stir this over a hot fire until smooth and 
glossy and then stir it into the hot milk, after which take the liquid mix- 
ture from the fire and cool. Beat together with a spoon the eggs, salt and 
two tablespoonfuls of the sugar. Add the cooled milk and strain. Pour 
the mixture into the cups which place in a deep pan. Pour into the pan

Set the plate containing the custard upon the upper grating of a hot oven. 
The sugar will melt and run in brown streams all over the molded pud- 
ding. Slip carefully to a dish; eat cold. Mrs. Hamilton. 

CUSTARD ROYALE. 

For the custard season two whole eggs with a little white pepper and 
salt and mix them with two tablespoonfuls of cream; color one-half with 
a drop or two of carmine; pour the two custards into two cups and stand 
these on a piece of paper in a stew-pan three parts full of boiling water, 
and let them steam till firm; then turn them out and when cold slice the 
custard and stamp the slices out in rounds the size of a dime; rinse in 
warm water and use. Be careful when cooking the custard that only the 
surrounding water boils, for should the custard itself boil it will not cook 
smoothly. Mrs. Frank Baxter.

RHUBARB SAUCE. 

A nice way to cook rhubarb (or pie-plant, as it is generally called) is 
to wash it and peel it, cutting into pieces one inch long. Allow one pound

ce-Greams. I6e§ and SHerlieis 

ICES are not, we regret to say, healthful when taken at the close of a 
inea!, and yet no dinner is looked upon as complete without them in 
some form or other. But when used at any other time they ate nourish- 
ing and refreshing. 

Frozen dishes will always, however, be popular in spite of the one 
unpleasant fact, and many of them are certainly delicious. Water ice, 
sherbets, punches and ice-creams all come under the head of frozen 
dishes. When a family prefers to make its own ice-cream it is essential 
that a good freezer be purchased. There are several such on the market, 
and the labor of manufacturing ices and kindred dishes is much lessened 
by the use of one. It is best to scald the cream, and the sugar should be 
dissolved In it while hot. Fruit juices should never be cooked. They 
should be beaten into the cream after it Is frozen, to attain the best 
results. For a four-quart freezer allow ten pounds of ice and two quarts 

of rock salt. 

PLAIN VANILLA. ICE CREAM. 

One quart of milk, the yolks of three eggs, three-fourths of a pint of 
sugar and two tablespoonfuls of corn-starch. Scald but do not boi . Then 
put the whites of three eggs into one and one-half pints of cream; whip 
it. Mix the milk and cream, flavor and freeze. Two teaspoonfuls of 
vanilla are generally sufficient. Ione Anderson. 

ICE-CREAM WITHOUT EGOS. 

Stir one quart of good cream, one-half pound of sugar and two tea- 
spoonfuls oi the extract of vanilla, until dissolved. Strain through a fine 
muslin and freeze, stirring rapidly. Instead of vanilla, any other flavor- 
ing desired may be used. Popular Caterer. 

ICE-CREAM WITHOUT COOKINQ. 

When the ordinary facilities for making Ice-cream are not at hand, it 
can be made by taking three pints of milk, four eggs well beaten, three- 
fourths of pound of sugar and one tablespoonful of corn-starch; mix in a 
three-quart tin pail; boil In a kettle of water till quite thick; add one pint

CHOCOLATE ICE=CREAM. 

For about two and one-half quarts of cream use one and one-half 
pints of milk, one quart of thin cream, two cupfuls of sugar, two ounces of 
chocolate, two eggs and two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour. Put the 
milk on to boil in the double boiler. Put the flour and one cupful of the 
sugar in a bowl, add the eggs and beat the mixture until light. Stir this 
into the boiling milk and cook for twenty minutes, stirring often. Scrape 
the chocolate and put it in a small saucepan. Add four tablespoonfuls of 
sugar (which should be taken from the second cupful) and two tablespoon- 
fuls of hot water. Stir over a hot fire until smooth and glossy. Add this 
to the cooking mixture. When the preparation has cooked for twenty 
minutes, take it from the fire and add the remainder of the sugar and the 
cream, which should be gradually beaten into the hot mixture. Set away 
to cool and when cold freeze. Maria Parloa. 

COFFEE ICE-CREXm. 

One gallon of cream, yolks of thirty-five eggs, two pounds ten ounces 
of sugar, two quarts of very strong black coffee (made up). Stir well with 
an G.^g beater and when beginning to thicken without boiling strain the 
mixture; allow it to become cold and freeze. R. W. S. 

PISTACHIO ICE=CREAM. 

Blanch and peel one-quarter of a pound of pistachios and pound them 
to a smooth paste with a few drops of rose-water. Beat the yolks of six 
eggs and pour over them one and one-half pints of boiling milk; add four 
ounces of powdered sugar and stir the custard over the fire until it begins 
to thicken; then pour it out and when cool stir into it the pounded pis- 
tachios and a teaspoonful of spinach coloring. Pass the whole through a

if preferred, one pint of cream and one-half pint of milk. Beat the mix- 
ture in a basin, rub it through a sieve, freeze and leave it in the ice-pail 
till it is wanted. If more convenient, raspberry jam or raspberry jelly 
may be used in place of the fresh fruit, and when this is done very little 
sugar will be required. A still more agreeable and refreshing ice-cream 
may be made with two portions of red currants mixed with one portion of 
raspberries, instead of raspberries alone. C. Casper. 

GINGER ICE-CREAM. 

Take one-quarter of a pound of preserved ginger, cut it into very thin 
slices, using a silver knife, put them into a saucepan with a pint of cream 
— or a pint of milk boiled and mixed with the yolks of six eggs — one-half

ture over the fire until it thickens a little, then strain through a sieve. 
Pour into a mold and when the cream is cold, freeze in the ordinary way. 
Keep in ice till wanted. W. T. M. 

BRICK ICE-CREAM. 

To make ice-cream in bricks a mold of the size and shape of an ordi- 
nary brick is need. The ices, no matter what their composition, are 
used to fill these molds which are made of copper or tin. After the molds 
are frozen they are cut in slices previous to being handed round. A 
knife dipped in hot water is used for this purpose. F. L. P. 

BOHEMIAN ICE-CREAM. 

The smaller varieties of ripe red fruit are used to make this cream; 
they are pulped through a fine sieve, and to one pint of the juice is added 
one and one-half ounces of the best isinglass, dissolved in one-half pint of 
water. Sweeten to taste and squeeze in lemon juice. Mix with this 
quantity a pint of sweetened whipped cream and mold for freezing. 



320 ICE-CREAMS, ICES AND SHERBETS. 

These creams, where raspberries only are used, may be put into glasses, 
and made without isinglass — in the proportions of a pound of fruit juice 
to one pint of whipped cream. Mrs. Leander Holmes. 

NOYEAU ICE-CREAM. 

Sweeten one-half pint of thick cream with two ounces of sugar. Add 
one tablespoonful of strained lemon juice and a glassful of noyeau. Mix 
thoroughly and freeze in the usual way. 

The noyeau for this cream is composed in this manner: Gather one- 
quarter of a pound of young peach leaves on a dry, sunny day. Put them 
into a jar and pour over them two pints of good brandy and leave them 
to infuse for a couple of days. Add a syrup made by dissolving a pound 
of sugar in a pint of water. Let the noyeau remain a few hours longer, 
then filter it carefully and it is ready for use. H. F. L. 

CRUSHED FRUIT ICE-CREAM. 

Two quarts of pure cream, one pint of milk, two and one-half cupfuls 

of granulated sugar, four teaspoonfuls of any extract you prefer, or, if 

fruit is substituted, use about a pint, or a little less, of crushed fruit, well 

sweetened, to the above amount of cream. Add the fruit when the cream 

is partly frozen. . Mrs. L. Benson. 

CHOCOLATE CREAM A LA COLBERT. 

Boil three pints of cream with ten ounces of sugar until reduced to a 
quart. Melt one-half pound of chocolate over a slow fire in one-half pint 
of water. Mix the melted chocolate with the cream, together with two 
ounces of gelatine that has been soaked in water. When the gelatine is 
melted and well mixed strain the whole through a cloth into a basin. 
Stir on ice till the contents begin to set and mix in three pints of well- 
whipped cream. E. D. White. 

BAKED-APPLE ICE-CREAM. 

Seven large baked apples with one cupful of sugar and two cupfuls of 
water, when well baked put through sieve; add one pint of rich cream and 
one cupful of milk; sweeten more than usual, cream, and color with one 
tablespoonful of red sugar and freeze. Minette Bailey. 

APRICOT ICE. 

Skin, divide and stone six large ripe apricots. Blanch, pound and add 
the kernels of the fruit, with the juice of two lemons, one-half pint of 
water and two pints of clarified sugar. Then pass all though a fine sieve

ANY people to-day object to 
candy because of the poisonous 
pastes used in the coloring. This ob- 
jection is bringing about the use of fruit 
juices instead of dyes which are not 
only harmless but make candy look 
even more attractive than under the 
old method. We give below a happy mother's various methods of how 
to color candy with fruits and vegetables. 

PREPARING SUGAR TO COLOR. 

Rub as much sugar as is desired for making candy through a fine sieve 
into a granite pan. Place on the stove to warm, stirring till nearly dry; 



turn out, and it is ready for use. 



H. F. E. 



TO COLOR CANDY YELLOW. 



Put fresh-grated peel of lemon or orange in a muslin bag with a speck 
of water, squeeze tightly; mix the juice with sugar. Carrot treated in the 
same way will give forth excellent coloring matter. H. F. E. 

TO COLOR CANDY CREAM COLOR. 

Follow same method as above, using less color in the mixture 

M F F 
TO COLOR CANDY GREEN. 

Pound vigorously a peck of freshly cut spinach, that has been well 
washed. Place it in a mortar dripping wet and pound till it is soft and 
pulpy. Wring the whole through a strong, clean cloth. Pour juice into a 
saucepan and stir over the fire until it begins to curdle, then pour the 
whole through a sieve to drain. Mix with the juice equal quantity of 
sugar, a tablespoonful of spirits of wine and a pinch of powdered alum. 
Keep cool in a well-corked glass bottle. H. F. E. 

TO COLOR CANDY RED. 

The color red is easily obtained from the pure juice of strawberry, 
raspberry or cranberry. This can be made in the fruit season, bottled; 

327 



328 CONFECTIONERY, 

and kept ready for use (see Chapter Fresh Fruits). Cochineal can also 
be used if desired although the fruit juice is more to be recommended. 
Lay a little cochineal on a plate, add to it a little cream of tartar and alum 
and boil with one-half cupful of water for twenty minutes, then strain 
through muslin. H. F. E. 

TO COLOR CANDY PINK. 

Follow same directions as above only use less coloring matter in the 
mixture. H. F. E. 

HOW TO MAKE CARAMEL SUGAR FOR CANDY. 

Put one-quarter of a pound of finely-sifted sugar into a preserving 
pan, with one-fourth cup of water, place it on a moderate fire, and stir it 
with a wooden spoon till it becomes brown; then stir it constantly until 
it is a dark brown. Add one cup of hot water. Draw it to the side of 
the fire and let it simmer very gently for one-quarter of an hour longer. 
Strain and bottle for use. If the fire is too fierce, the caramel will be 
discolored. D. C. F. 

PINK SUGAR FOR ORNAMENTING. 

Crush the sugar either coarsely or to a powder, whichever is required. 
Place two or three drops of fruit juices or prepared cochineal in the palm 
of the hand, and rub the sugar in with it until it is sufficiently colored, 
when it is ready for use. S. C. A. 

TO CLARIFY SUGAR. 

Melt four pounds of sugar in two quarts of water, over the fire. 
When it boils beat in the white of one egg well whisked. Let come to a 
boil, skim, boil ten minutes; strain and bottle. Charlotte Hunt. 

FLAVORED SUGAR. 

Rub the required quantity of powdered sugar through a fine sieve on 
a granite pan, set it on the stove to warm, and whisjc in any kind of 
flavoring desired. H. E. A. 

HOW TO TELL WHEN CANDY IS SUFFICIENTLY COOKED. 

There are several methods of testing sugar while cooking. All skilled 
sugar boilers advise the use of a thermometer graduated from fifty degrees 
Fahrenheit to 350 degrees Fahrenheit. They claim that while the sugar 
is undergoing the process of boiling it is very nearly impossible for a 
learner to determine the exact degree which the sugar has attained with- 
out the aid of the thermometer. However, only a few skilled boilers use 



CONFECTIONERY. 329 

them. The common method is to drop a drop of the syrup into cold water. 
The sugar must be boiled according to the kind of candy to be made, and 
there are several degrees, known as "smooth," "thread," "ball," and 
"crack." All these stages of the syrup must be learned by experi- 
menting, and the ingenuity of the candy-maker brought into use. The 
"crack" degree (300 degrees or over) is used for most candies. It is a 
good plan to butter the dish in which sugar or molasses is to be cooked 
within a couple of inches of the top. This prevents the sugar rising any 
any higher and running over. 

Do not put candy in a refrigerator to cool, but in a cold, dry place. 

E. J. C. 
NUT CANDY. 

In one gill of cold water dissolve one pound of sugar and one-half 
salt-spoonful of cream of tartar. Place over the fire and cook till brittle, 
stirring in one-quarter of an ounce of butter. Shell some peanuts or any 
other nuts desired. Rub off the inner skin, put a layer two deep on the 
bottom of well-buttered tins and when the candy is hot pour it over the 
nuts and leave till cold. Break it into pieces of convenient size. 

Dorothy Buchanan. 

iVlACAROONS OF NUTS. 

Pound the meats of hickory nuts and add nutmeg and allspice. Make 
a frosting as if for a cake, stirring in the nuts and spices. Butter the 
hands and work into little balls the size of hickory nuts; place them on 
buttered tins and bake in a hot oven. They will spread a little on the 
tins. Pearl Butler. 

LEHON DROPS. 

Dissolve a coffee-cupful of powdered sugar with lemon juice. Boil 
till it is brittle when a little is plunged into cold water. Butter plates and 
let the candy fall on them in drops. Set away to get hard, 

Jean Lamont. 
COCOANUT DROPS. 

Grate a cocoanut, add one-half of its weight of sugar and the white of 
an egg beaten to a stiff froth. Mix thoroughly and drop on buttered 
white paper or tin plates. Bake fifteen minutes. John Fuller. 

PEPPERMINT DROPS. 

Take one cupful of sugar and let it come to a boil with one-half cup- 
ful of water. Take it from the fire as soon as it comes to this degree of 



330 CONFECTIONERY, 

heat. Stir all the time and add one-half teaspoonful of essence of pep- 
permint and drop the candy on an oiled slab. Pour it from the spout of 
the pan else the liquid will grain before the drops are molded. 

Jannet Bluer. 
COUGH DROPS. 

Prepare the following: Two ounces of dried hoarhound, one ounce of 
dried camomile, one ounce of boneset, and two ounces of mullein-flowers; 
place them all in a saucepan, cover them with water and boil for ten 
minutes. Turn out into an earthenware dish and cover tightly and let 
stand until cold. Strain and pass the liquor through a hair-sieve. Meas- 
ure the liquor and to each pint allow two pounds of loaf sugar. Put the 
sugar and liquor into a saucepan, boil to the crack degree, let it cool, pour 
it into a buttered pan and cut it into squares. Dr. Smith. 

PEANUT BRITTLE. 

Put two cupfuls of sugar in a spider over not too hot a fire; stir con- 
stantly till il melts; then stir in quickly one teacupful of chopped peanuts; 
mix thoroughly and pour on a buttered platter; spread thin. 

Anna Schuere. 
BALTIMORE CARAHELS. 

One-half cupful of molasses, one-half cupful of milk, two cupfuls of 
sugar, two squares of Baker's chocolate, butter the size of an ^gg] boil 
from ten to fifteen minutes; when taken from the fire add one teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla. Tessa Welch. 

FIG CANDY. 

One pound of sugar, one pint of water, boil over a slow fire; when done 
add small piece of butter; be careful to boil slowly and not quite the 
usual thickness; turn all over split figs. Lettie Weeks. 

ALHOND CANDY. 

Two cupfuls of white sugar, one and one-half cupfuls of sweet milk; 
boil until it will crisp in water like molasses candy; add one-half cupful of 
blanched almonds, perfectly dry. W. T. M. 

CHINESE FRUIT CANDY. 

One cocoanut, one and one-half pounds of granulated sugar, wet with 
the milk of the cocoanut; put in saucepan, let heat slowly; then boil 
rapidly five minutes, add the cocoanut grated very fine and boil ten min- 
utes, stirring constantly; try on a cool plate; if it forms a firm paste when 



CONFECTIONERY. 331 

cool take it from the fire, pour one-half of it out on a large tin lined with 
greased paper, then add to the remaining cream one-fourth pound of 
raisins (stoned), one-half pound of blanched almonds, one pint of pecan 
nuts, one-half cupful of chopped walnuts; pour over the other cream. 
When cool cut in bars. Alice Wilson. 

POTATO CANDY. 

Bake ordinary-sized potatoes, scrape out inside, mash fine, add quickly 
as much confectioner's sugar as it will take; have ready nut meats; stir 
in all you wish; make into tiny little balls or pats; when cold, are deli- 
cious. If you wish chocolate creams, dip the above into melted Baker's 
chocolate; lay on a buttered paper to cool. Besse T. 

MAPLE CANDY. 

To two cupfuls of maple syrup add one cupful of granulated sugar 
and butter the size of a walnut. Cook until it hardens. Pour into but- 
tered pan and set away to cool. Ruby. 

RIBBON CANDY. 

Boil three cupfuls of sugar, moistened with water, to the crack, flavor- 
ing and coloring it as desired; turn it into a greased pan and let it cool. 
Turn in the edges, and pull either with the hands or by means of a hoop, 
until light in appearance. Run it through a roller set so close that it will 
come out as thin as a wafer. Make into fancy shapes and let cool before 
packing away in boxes. Of course, butter the hands before beginning to 
pull. E. Arnold. 

PINEAPPLE GLACE. 

Cut a pineapple crosswise into thin slices and then again into quarters. 
Beat the whites of three eggs to a stiff froth; lay the fruit in this, drain 
and dip again the part that drips off. Select the pieces one by one and 
by the aid of a skewer dip them into finely powdered sugar. Place the 
fruit in an oiled or buttered pan and put in an oven that is cooling. Pile 
them on a dish and set them in a cool place until wanted. 

Palmer Miller. 
BUTTER SCOTCH. 

Take three cupfuls of brown sugar, four ounces butter. Do not stir 
it but as soon as it snaps and breaks add a good pinch of baking soda. 
Let boil two minutes longer and pour it into well-buttered biscuit tins. 
While partly cold mark off into squares P. Miller. 



332 



CONFECTIONERY. 



FUDGES. 

Four cupfuls of granulated sugar, one-half cupful of cream, one- 
half cupful of milk, one-quarter of a pound of butter, one-half cake of 
Baker's chocolate grated. Put all over hot fire until it begins to thicken, 
stirring constantly. Place pan in another of hot water and cook until it is 
easily formed into a ball when dropped into cold water, but not hard or 
brittle. Remove from fire at this stage, flavor with a teaspoonful of 
vanilla and stir until it begins to set. Pour in pan to depth of one-hali 
inch and mark off in squares. Stanley Miller. 

EVERTON TAFFY. 

Take one-half pound of the best quality of brown sugar, one ounce of 
butter, one-half wine-glassful of water. Let sugar and water boil till they 
become a smooth, thick syrup. Add three drops of lemon essence, stir- 
ring briskly. Pour into buttered pans or onto a marble slab. 

T. J. M. 
NOUGAT. 

This is a rare confection made of various kinds of nuts. When 

newly prepared it is sufficiently elastic to enable one to mold into cups, 

baskets or any other shapes. The following recipes give two styles to 

make them. 

ALMOND NOUGAT. 

Put eight ounces of fine powdered sugar into a copper egg-whipping 
bowl and mix in the whites of three eggs, whipping continually over a 
clear fire until the paste is of the consistency of thick batter. Add one- 
half pound of almonds blanched and chopped into small pieces, two 
ounces of chopped candied orange peel, one tablespoonful of vanilla sugar 
(see flavored sugar — this chapter), and a few drops of strawberry juice. 
Mix and spread out upon two pieces of wafer-paper to about one inch in 
thickness, cover with two more pieces of paper, using a flat tin with a 
small weight on top to keep them level. Put them in an oven of very 
moderate heat and bake for a few minutes. Take out and when nearly 
dry cut them up into oblong squares, or shape into baskets when first 
taken from the oven; form them before they have a chance to harden. 

M. E. R. 
BRAZILIAN NOUGAT. 

Blanch five ounces of sweet almonds and cut them into fine threads. 
Roast the meats of three ounces of Brazilian nuts and peel and chop them 
with one and one-half ounces of candied lemon peel, mix them with the 



CONFECTIONERY. 333 

altnonds and three-fourths of a pound of confectioner's sugar. Whip the 
whites of two eggs to a stiff froth, sir them into the other ingredients and 
work all to a paste. Spread on a sheet of wafer-paper, cover with 
another sheet, press between two sheets of tin and put in the oven for 
thirty minutes. Leave till cold before cutting up. M. A. B. 

CANDIED CHERRIES, PINEAPPLE AND OTHER FRUITS. 

Boil but do not stir one-half pound of loaf sugar in one breakfast-cup- 
ful of water. Pit some cherries, or prepare any desired fruit, and string 
them on a thread, then dip them in the syrup; suspend them by the 
thread. When pineapples are used, slice them crosswise and dry them on 
a sieve, or in the open air; oranges should be separated into sections and

BRAZIL-NUTS PRALINES. 

Put one pound of shelled Brazil-nuts into a pan over the fire with one- 
fourth of a cupful of vinegar and water mixed and two cupfuls of brown 
sugar. Let boil until they begin to sparkle, then remove the pan from 
the fire and with a spoon stir the nuts well until the sugar begins to feel 
gritty; put them over a slow fire again in order to dissolve the sugar and 
keep on stirring until they turn reddish; pour them onto a sieve, cover 
the sieve with a clean cloth and place it in the oven; this will dry the 
sugar and cause the nuts to look glossy. Any other nuts may be used 
instead D. Z. Brooks. 

COCOANUT JAP. 

Over a slow fire place one quart of New Orleans molasses and one-

CREAn CHOCOLATE CARAMELS. 

Mix together in a graniteware saucepan one-half pint of sugar, one- 
half pint of molasses, one-half pint of thick cream, one generous table- 
spoonful of butter and four ounces of chocolate. Place on the fire and 
stir until the mixture boils. Cook until a few drops of it will harden if 
dropped into ice-water; then pour into well-buttered pans, having the 
mixture about three inches deep. When nearly cold mark into squares. 
It will take almost an hour to boil this in a graniteware pan but not half 
so long if cooked in an iron frying-pan. Stir frequently while boiling. 
The caramels must be put in a very cold place to harden.

5UQAR CHOCOLATE CARAMELS. 

Mix two cupfuls of sugar, three-fourths of a cupful of milk or cream, 
one generous tablespoonful of butter and three ounces of chocolate. 
Place on the fire and cook, stirring often, until a little of the mixture when 
dropped in ice-water will harden; then stir in one-fourth of a cupful of 
sugar and one tablespoonful of vanilla, and pour into a well-buttered pan, 
having the mixture about three-fourths of an inch deep. When nearly 
cold, mark it off in squares and put in a cold place to harden. These 
caramels are sugary and brittle, and can be made in the hottest weather 
without trouble. Miss Maria Parloa. 

CHOCOLATE CREAMS. 

Beat the whites of two eggs to a sti£f froth. Gradually beat into this 
two cupfuls of confectioners' sugar. If the eggs be large, it may take a

little more sugar. Flavor with one-half teaspoonful of vanilla and work 
well. Now roll into little balls and drop on a slightly buttered platter. 
Let the balls stand for an hour or more. Shave five ounces of chocolate 
and put into a small bowl, which place on the fire in a saucepan containing 
boiling water. When the chocolate is melted, take the saucepan to the 
table and drop the creams into the chocolate one at a time, taking them 
out with a fork and dropping them gently on the buttered dish. It will 
take one-half hour or more to harden the chocolate. Miss Parloa. 

CHOCOLATE CREAMS— No. 2. 

For these creams you should make a fondant in this way: Put into a 
graniteware saucepan one cupful of water and two cupfuls of granulated 
sugar — or a pound of loaf sugar. Stir until the sugar is nearly melted; 
then place on the fire and heat slowly, but do not stir the mixture. 
Watch carefully and note when it begins to boil. When the sugar has 
been boiling for ten minutes, take up a little of it and drop in ice-water. 
If it hardens enough to form a. soft ball when rolled between the thumb 
and finger, it is cooked enough. Take the saucepan from the fire 
instantly and set in a cool dry place. When the syrup is so cool that the 
finger can be held in it comfortably, pour it into a bowl, and stir with a 
wooden spoon until it becomes thick and white. When it begins to look 
dry, and a little hard, take out the spoon, and work with the hand until 
the cream is soft and smooth. Flavor with a few drops of vanilla, and, 
after shaping, cover with chocolate, as directed in the preceding recipe. 

Caution. — Do not stir the syrup while it is cooking, and be careful not 
to jar or shake the saucepan. Miss Parloa. 

SUGARED ALMONDS. 

Boil together a syrup made from one pound of sugar and one pint of 
water. Blanch one pound of sweet almonds and put them in; let them 
boil for some minutes. Take them out and drain them; let the syrup boil 
until thick, then return the almonds, and take them out when coated with 
sugar, which will be in a minute or two. They should be thoroughly 
dried and kept in a warm place. Mrs. Maria Tomlin. 

ALMOND BON-BONS. 

Grilled almonds make a delicious bon-bon. Blanch a cupful of 
almonds and dry them thoroughly. Boil one cupful of granulated sugar 
with one-quarter cupful of water until it "hairs"; then throw in the

almonds. Let them cook in this syrup, stirring occasionally until they 
become a delicate golden brown before the sugar changes. As soon as 
the sugar commences to take on a color quickly take the pan from the 
fire and stir the almonds rapidly until the syrup has turned back to sugar 
and clings irregularly to the nuts. Mrs. Almira Town.

POP-CORN BALLS. 

Pop the corn and take out all the hard kernels, then put in a large 
pan, the larger the better. For seventy balls, take two cupfuls of sugar 
and two cupfuls of molasses and boil them until, when you drip a little 
nto cold water, it is brittle; then pour in a thin stream over the corn. 
One person should pour and the other stir up the corn constantly to get it 
\W. mixed in with the candy. The less candy used the better. The corn 
must be salted and buttered. Work it into balls with the hands.

becomes hard and brittle stir in a teaspoonful of soda and beat well; pour 
into buttered pan and when cool pull until yellow, using butter on your 
hands, so that the candy will not stick. M. C. B.

A SUGAR OFF WITH MAPLE SYRUP. 

Those who have lived among the maple groves of Vermont, New 
York, Michigan or parts of Canada know what real enjoyment there is in 
a "Sugar Off." But good things like these cannot be kept a secret, and 
so if you want one of the nicest edible treats of your life, take two quarts 
of genuine (not imitation) maple syrup and put it over the fire in a large 
granite kettle and let it boil without stirring until you can wax it by drop- 
ping a little in cold water. While it is boiling, get ready some pieces of 
flat ice, about four or five inches thick and five inches long. Put one piece 
on each plate. Now when all is ready lift from the kettle by means of a 
large spoon a little of the "Sugar Off" and spread over the ice. Eat at 
once while it is warm. No harm if it cools, except that the pleasure wanes 
with the cooling. If ice is not to be had, snow or cold water will answer 
the purpose but ice is better. Some prefer to eat it from a saucer without 
either ice or snow. By stirring the wax in a saucer it will grain and 
become sugar. It is still good. Mrs. Eliza Locke.

OrFEE. TEA, 

COCOA and BEVERAGES 

AS THE human body is composed of two-thirds its weight in water, so 
upon the liquid we drink depends, to a large degree, health and 
long life. Through it, the blood receives new life and discharges the 
worn-out substances. In this way it becomes a part of the human frame, 
and is derived principally from the outside, in the form of drinks and food. 

DRINKING WATER. 

Great care, therefore, should be exercised as to the sort of water we 
drink as well as to the food we eat. Water, when pure, is a colorless, 
transparent liquid. 

Rain water is the best example of pure water known, but when it 
stands in cisterns it is liable to become contaminated by neighboring sinks 
and vaults and rendered unfit to drink. 

Spring water is the nearest approach to perfect water that we have. 
This is particularly so when it flows through rocky or sandy soil. A "liv- 
ing spring" is a boon to humanity, and how beautiful that our country is 
blessed with them. 

FILTERED WATER. 

The functions of water are so important to the human race that 
where the least suspicion occurs as to its purity, it should be either filtered 
or boiled before using. Many people in cities take the double precaution. 
They first filter the water, then boil it. In boiling, the insoluble lime which 
the water takes up in its passage through the air and soil is precipitated to 
the bottom of the kettle, thus the impurities are eliminated, and the water 
becomes soft. Filters are procurable at a slight cost. They are valu^ 
able in taking sediment out of water, but they do not remove germs. 
Boiling must do this. 

BAD EFFECTS OF ICE-WATER. 

Ice-water taken to excess is detrimental. It chills the mucous mem- 
branes, and creates an inflammation which calls for more and more ©f the 
liquid. It interferes with the formation of gastric juices. Dyspepsia is 

339 



340 COFFEE, TEA, COCOA AND BEVERAGES. 

also often traceable to its use. An old-fashioned, but good, method of 
cooling water for drinking purposes is to draw it in a stone pitcher, cover 
over the top and place several folds of cloth around the outside, wetting 
them as often as they become dry. Another way, and a better one still if 
one has ice, is to bottle the water and set the bottle on ice. 

HEALTHFULNESS OF TEA AND COFFEE. 

Much has been said of the unhealthfu ness of tea and coffee, in pro- 
ducing unpleasant and dyspeptic symptoms, but a person of ordinary good 
health can partake of both beverages moderately with food, without 
serious effects. 

Both coffee and tea should be kept in tin "caddies." Wood will 
impart an odor to either article if enclosed in it. Coffee should be bought 
in small quantities and in the green berry, if practicable. When one 
roasts and grinds it oneself one is certain of no adulterations. Three- 
fourths Java and one-fourth Mocha makes the best mixture. 

TEA— HOW TO MAKE. 

Tea should be made as soon as the water boils, and only a small 
quantity of hot water should be poured on at first. Then it should be set 
back from the fire where it will "draw" for about five minutes, then filled 
up with boiling water and brought to the table. The usual recipe is two 
teaspoonfuls of tea to each cupful of water, but I should advise much less 
tea than this. 

Water that has stood in the kettle over night should never be used. 
Ceylon tea must be made in small quantities, and made often, as it 
becomes bitter by standing. Uncolored Japan is considered the purest of 
all teas. An Old Tea Drinker. 

RUSSIAN TEA. 

A tea made after the manner of that made in Russia is growing in 
favor in this country and especially so for afternoon tea drinking. To 
make it properly a semivar is needed but in the absence of the semivar, tea 
can be made in the usual way and poured into cups in which has been 
placed a thin slice of lemon. Serve. Society Woman, 

HOW TO MAKE QOOD COFFEE. 

Coffee is the breakfast beverage of thousands, but how little enjoy- 
ment if it is so poorly made as to lead one to wonder if the real coffee 
ever entered into its make-up. For five persons use one-half cupful or a 
trifle more of ground coffee; stir into it one-half of the white of an egg 



COFFEE, TEA, COCOA AND BEVERAGES, 341 

and a little cold water. Now pour all into the coffee boiler and pour on 
five cups of boiling water. Let it slowly come to a boil and then, with a 
granite spoon, stir it up and set it back on the range to settle. In eight 
minutes it is ready, clear as amber and very delicious. 

T. J. Thompson. 
DRIP COFFEE. 

Hardware stores now sell a patent coffee pot which has a compart- 
ment for placing the coffee in, and the boiling water is poured on it and 
it drips or filters through. A good drip pot may be made by taking a 
ring that fits the inside of the pot at the top and a muslin bag can be 
sewed on this ring, into which the ground coffee can be put. Pour all the 
boiling water you will need over the coffee and close the lid. When it 
has all passed through it is done and ready to drink.

ICED COFFEE.

are very astringent in their raw state, but they lose this quality when 
roasted. Delicate children are benefitted by this method of preparing 
acorns. They are always gathered in autumn when they are ripe, shelled 
and cut into pieces the size of coffee berries when they are thoroughly 
dried in a cool oven. They are then roasted like ordinary coffee, until 
they become a cinnamon-brown. After roasting, the acorns are ground 
or pounded in a mortar, to prevent their becoming tough; a very little 
butter is added and the coffee is then placed in air-tight bottles. Prepare 
in the same way as ordinary coffee. Julia Davis. 

CHOCOLATE AS A HELTHFUL DRINK. 

It is evident that the coming American is going to be less of a tea and 
coffee drinker and more of a cocoa and chocolate drinker. This is the 
natural result of a better knowledge of the laws of health and of the food 
value of a beverage which nourishes the body, while it stimulates the 
brain. 

There are to-day many manufacturers of chocolate and cocoa. I am 
often asked which kind is the best. This is a hard question to answer, 
for all claim superior merit. For the benefit of my readers I copy below 
a paragraph which appeared in "The Medical World," in 1896. The 
source of the article led me to think that The Walter Baker & Co.'s 
chocolate and cocoa was pure, and ever since I have used it for both 
cooking and drinking purposes, and have found it to be excellent: 

"Tea and coffee are stimulants; chocolate is a food, a delicious and 
nutritious food. Messrs. Walter Baker & Co., of Dorchester, Mass., have 
manufactured these preparations for over a hundred years; and prominent 
among their numerous claims of merit is that of absolute purity. The 
admixture of alkalies is prominent in Germany, but the above-mentioned 
American firm use no alkalies or other chemicals or dyes in their 
processes." 

All chocolate and cocoa recipes contained herein, signed by Miss 
Parloa, have been tried by the above firm and pronounced perfect. I use 
them with their permission. 

PLAIN CHOCOLATE. 

For six people, use one quart of milk, two ounces of chocolate, one 
tablespoonful of corn-starch, three tablespoonfuls of sugar and two table- 
spoonfuls of hot water. Mix the corn-starch with one gill of the milk. 
Put the remainder of the milk on to heat in the double boiler. When the 
milk comes to the boiling point stir in the corn-starch and cook for ten 



COFFEE, TEA, COCOA AND BEVERAGES. 343 

minutes. Have the chocolate cut in fine bits and put it in a small iron or 
granite-ware pan; add the sugar and water and place the pan over a hot 
fire. Stir constantly until the mixture is smooth and glossy. Add this to 
the hot milk, and beat the mixture with a whisk until it is frothy. Or the 
chocolate may be poured back and forth from the boiler to a pitcher, hold- 
ing high the vessel from which you pour. This will give a thick froth. 
Serve at once. If you prefer not to have the chocolate thick omit the 
corn-starch. Maria Parloa. 

CHOCOLATE MADE WITH CONDENSED MILK. 

Follow the rule for plain chocolate, substituting water for the milk, 
and adding three tablespoonfuls of condensed milk when the chocolate is 
added. Miss Parloa. 

CHOCOLATE, VIENNA STYLE. 

Use four ounces of vanilla chocolate, one quart of milk, three table- 
spoonfuls of hot water and one tablespoonful of sugar. Cut the chocolate 
in fine bits. Put the milk on the stove in the double boiler and when it 
has been heated to the boiling point, put the chocolate, sugar and water 
in a small iron or graniteware pan and stir over a hot fire until smooth 
and glossy. Stir this mixture into the hot milk and beat well with a 
whisk. Serve at once, putting a tablespoonful of whipped cream in each 
cup and then filling up with the chocolate. The plain chocolate may be 
used instead of the vanilla, but in that case use a teaspoonful of vanilla 
extract and three generous tablespoonfuls of sugar instead of one. 

Maria Parloa. 

coceA. 

Breakfast cocoa is powdered so fine that it can be dissolved by pour- 
ing boiling water on it. For this reason it is often prepared at the table. 
A small teaspoonful of the powder is put in the cup with a teaspoonful of 
sugar; on this is poured two-thirds of a cupful of boiling water and milk 
or cream is added to suit the individual taste. This is very convenient; 
but cocoa is not nearly so good when prepared in this manner as when it 
is boiled. For six cupfuls of cocoa use two tablespoonfuls of the 
powder, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one-half pint of boiling water and 
one and one-half pints of milk. Put the milk on the stove in the double 
boiler. Put the cocoa and sugar in the boiler and gradually pour the hot 
water upon it, stirring all the time. Place the saucepan on the fire and 
stir until the contents boil. Let this mixture boil for five minutes; then 
add the boiling milk and serve. A gill of cream is a great addition to 
this cocoa. Miss Parloa.

IMPERIAL DRINK. 

Put one-half ounce of cream of tartar into a large pitcher which 
should be well heated first; add the sliced rind of a large lemon, one- 
quarter of a pound of lump sugar and three pints of boiling water. Cover 
closely and let the pitcher stand near the fire for an hour. Stir the liquid 
often while hot and when quite cold and clear pour off from the sediment.

COCOA SHELLS. 

These shells are very nutritious and free from the oil that both cocoa 
and chocolate contain. Take a heaping teacupful to a quart of boil- 
ing water. Boil them two hours. Scald milk as for coffee. If there is 
not time to boil shells long enough before breakfast, it is well to soak them 
over night and boil them in the same water in the morning. 

Amanda Johnson. 
LEMONADE. 

Lemonade should be made in the proportion of one lemon to each 
large goblet. Squeeze the lemons and take out any seeds. If you do not 
like the pulp strain the juice. Sweeten the drink well though that is a 
matter of taste. The pleasant tart taste should be preserved. Add water 
to the juice and when serving put cracked ice and a thin slice of lemon 

into each glass. E. J. C. 

MILK SHAKE. 

Fill a glass two-thirds full of milk; sweeten it to taste with any fruit

may be put in. It is a cooling drink and almost as good as lemonade, 
some preferring it. Mrs. C. R. Thompson. 

ICED BUTTERMILK. 

There is no healthier drink than buttermilk, but it must be fresh and 
rich to be good. It should be kept on ice and just before serving a little 
shaved ice put into each glass will improve it still more. C. I. Milton. 

A SUMMER DRINK. 

Take one quart of cold water, three and one-fourth pounds of white 
sugar, one teaspoonful of oil of lemon, one tablespoonful of flour beaten 
up with the whites of five eggs; mix together. Divide the syrup and add 
four ounces of carbonate of soda to one-half, which put in a bottle. Then 
add three ounces of tartaric acid to the other one-half of the syrup and 
bottle it also. When a cool drink is wanted take two pint tumblers and 
placing a tablespoonful of syrup (one from each bottle) in each tumbler; 
fill each one half full of fresh cold water. Then pour both into one tum- 
bler and it is ready. Mrs. Jane Harding. 

EGG-NOG. 

The yolk of an ^gg must be well beaten with one teaspoonful of sugar, 
a trifle of salt, two-thirds glassful of milk; one-half teaspoonful of rum and

dessert-spoonful of this in a glassful of water will prove a refreshing 
drink. Mina Wester. 

LEMON SYRUP. 

A syrup that is nice for bottling for future use is made by boiling the 
juice from one dozen lemons till clear, with two pounds of white sugar to

with the juice of the lemons. Boil ten minutes, stirring all the time. This 
makes a nice drink. Mrs. M. Harper. 

CURRANT WATER. 

Take one cupful of ripe crushed currants, mix with one-quarter of a 
pound of pulverized sugar and one-half pint of cold water. Pour the mix- 
ture through a fine sieve, add the juice of one lemon and one and one-half 
pints of cold water; mix thoroughly, strain again and set on ice till 
wanted. This is a nice, cool drink on a warm day and easily made in 
currant season. Miss C.

JELLIES AND JANS 



FOR THE promotion of health and the saving of lab®r fruits 
for desserts far surpass pies and puddings. It is needless to 
say that4ruits for preserving should be sound and the kettles used should 
be of granite or porcelain lined and the spoons used for stirring should be 
of granite or wood. The amount of sugar required depends upon cir- 
cumstances. Our grandmothers used a pound of sugar to a pound of 
fruit — but then they used, too, the old-fashioned stone crock or open jar 
in which to store the fruit. Now, most preserves are put in sealed cans 
and only three-fourths of a pound of sugar is required to preserve fruit 
perfectly. Keep in a dark dry closet. If the closet is cool so much the 
better but always have it dry. 

TO CLARIFY SUGAR. 

To clarify sugar dissolve sugar in water in the proportion o! one 
pound of sugar in a cupful of water; add to it the white of an egg and 
beat, put into a preserving kettle on the fire and stir with a granite spoon. 
When it boils up put in a little cold water; let boil again, take off and 
remove the scum; repeat until it is clear. J. T C 

CRAB APPLES PRESERVED. 

Select good sound ones and take the blows off the ends but leave on 
the stems. Then wash them and put Into preserving kettle with plenty 
of water to cover. When boiling push them gently down so that they 
may be under the water all the time. When skin begins to crack, skim 
them out on a dish. Allow one and one-half pounds of sugar to each 
pint of juice letting boil fifteen to twenty minutes, skimming till clear. 
Then return the fruit to the juice, part at a time, and boil fifteen minutes. 
Then lift out the apples again on a dish and add the rest of the fruit to 
the juice, boiling them the same length of time. Fill cans with apples 
to the top. Boil down the juice that is left in the kettle about ten min- 
utes and pour it over the fruit in the jars. Fasten up tight and set away.

352 PRESERVES, SPICED FRUITS, JELLIES AND JAMS. 

If some of the fruit be grubby, cut out the grubs taking off stems and cook 
them in water enough to boil like apple sauce. Strain through a colander 
and put all back with juice in the kettle, adding sugar, pound for pound, 
cooking fifteen minutes and skimming constantly. Put the fruit in a jar 
and it makes a nice marmalade. Miss Clara White. 

QUINCE PRESERVES. 

Pare and core the fruit and boil till very tender- Make a syrup of a 
pound of sugar for each pound of the fruit and after removing all the 
scum boil the quinces in this syrup for one-half hour. 

Mrs. K. Knowles. 

QUINCE AND APPLE PRESERVE. 

Pare, core and quarter as many sour apples as desired to preserve in 
this manner; pare, core and separate into eighths one-fourth as may 
quinces. Make a syrup of one quart of water and three-fourths as much 
sugar in pounds as there are apples and quinces combined. Drop in the 
quinces first, let them cook thirty minutes, then add the apples and cook 
all together until tender and well preserved. Seal. W. T. J. 

CANDIED QUINCES. 

Select firm quinces, rub them over with a damp cloth, peel, core and 
cut each one into several pieces. The peels and cores should be tied in a 
muslin bag and boiled with the quinces. Place all in a preserving kettle 
on the stove, pour over them enough boiling water to nearly cover, and allow 
them to boil slowly until they are tender; then drain off the water and let 
cool. Weigh the quinces and allow an equal weight of sugar. When 
cold put them into glass jars in alternate layers, first sugar, then quinces, 
and so on, and seal. The juice in which they are boiled should be saved; 
add to it its weight in sugar and make into jelly. Blanche. 

PINEAPPLE PRESERVES. 

To every pound of fruit, weighed after being pared, allow one pound 
of loaf sugar and one-quarter of a pint of water. The pines should be 
perfectly sound, but ripe. Cut them into rather thick slices, as the fruit 
shrinks in boiling; pare off the rind carefully, that none of the pine be 
wasted, and in doing so notch it in and out, as the rind cannot be 
smoothly cut without great care. Dissolve a portion of the sugar in a 
preserving pan with one-quarter of a pint of water; when this is melted, 
gradually add the remainder of the sugar, and boil until it forms a clear 



PRESERVES, SPICED FRUITS, JELLIES AND JAMS. 353 

syrup, skimming well. As soon as this is done put in the pieces of pine 
and boil well for one-half hour, or until it looks very transparent. Put it 
into pots, cover down when cold and store away in a dry place. 

Mrs. S. Ament. 

CITRON PRESERVE. 

Peel and seed with great care. Cut into pieces about three to four 
inches in s^zel Place citron over the fire in preserving kettle, after cover- 
ing it with water. Cook until it can be pierced with a straw. Skim it out 
upon a platter and add sugar in proportion of one and one-half pounds to 
each pint of juice. (Two full coffee-cupfuls of sugar equal one pound.) 
Cook this juice until the scum quits rising. Then put citron back and boil 
till clear, over one hour. Take citron out and boil clear juice fifteen 
minutes. Slice into the juice three lemons to each four quarts of citron, 
boiling till the time is up: fifteen minutes. Use lemon peel and juice 
removing only the seeds. When you turn citron into the bottles make 
them half full oi fruit and fill them up with the hot juice, fastening them 
up while hot. Put a spoon into each jar while putting in fruit and set a 
napkin wet in cold water under the jars while filling. 

Annie R. White. 
PRESERVED PEARS. 

If the seckle pear can be obtained select that on account of its size 
and flavor but if not to be had then any other pear will answer. Pare off 
the peeling with a thin knife so as not to waste the fruit. If a seckle leave 
it whole; if another variety, separate it in halves. Make a syrup of sugar 
and water, using three-fourths of a pound of sugar to every pound of 
fruit to be preserved and one cupful of water to a pound of sugar. Drop 
in the fruit and carefully cook. Just before taking from the stove drop 
in a few whole cloves, about two to every pear. Cloves are a great addi- 
tion as they help bring out the flavor of the pear. Mrs. R. A. 

TO PRESERVE WATERMELON RIND. 

Same as Citron. 

TO PRESERVE BERRIES WHOLE. 

Take the fruit when not over-ripe, pick over carefully, wash and put in 
glass jars, filling each one about three-fourths full. Make a syrup of a 
pound of granulated sugar and one cupful of water for every one and one- 
half pounds of fruit and let it boil slowly fifteen minutes. Pour syrup into 
the jars over the berries, filling them up to the top; then set the jars in a 
boiler of cold water with a generous amount of straw or excelsior in the

bottom of the boiler to prevent the cans from falling against each ©ther. 
Place on the stove and let the water boil until the fruit becomes scalding 
hot; add more syrup as the fruit settles. Now take out of the cans and 
seal tight. If these directions are followed the fruit will keep for years. 

Mrs. a. Peters. 
PRESERVED CHERRIES. 

Select the large cherries, remove the stems and stone them carefully, 
fo each pound of sugar allow one pound of cherries. Put fruit in granite 
pan and pour over them the sugar. Stir up and let stand over night to 
candy. In the morning put all into the preserving pan, place on the stove 
and boil gently until the cherries look clear, skimming off the scum as it 
rises. When the cherries have become quite clear, remove the pan from 
the stove and seal. Keep in dry dark closet. Theresa Harrington. 

PRESERVED EQG PLUflS. 

Take two pounds of sugar for every three pounds of plums; wash the 
plums and drain; put the sugar on a slow fire in the preserving kettle, 
with as much water as it will melt and let simmer slowly; prick each plum 
with a needle and place in cans and in boiler of cold water (see How to 
Preserve Berries Whole), pour over the syrup and cook till the skins 
break and you feel they are thoroughly heated. As they settle add more 
syrup. Seal while hot. D. Hall. 

CALIFORNIA PRESERVED PRUNES. 

Wash four pounds of prunes and place in a granite pan over the fire 
with enough water to cover; set the pan over a slow fire and cook slowly 
until the fruit is tender, then remove, and pass through a sieve. To each 
pound of the pulp add three-fourths of a pound of sugar; make a syrup 
of the sugar with a little water and add the pulp. Boil for fifteen min- 
utes. Seal. Minerva Allison. 

PRESERVED NECTARINES. 

(Florida Recipe. ) 

Pare, halve, stone and weigh the nectarines. Steam till tender. 
Make a syrup of three-fourths of a pound of sugar to every pound of 
fruit. Put sugar in granite pan, add just enough water to dissolve it and 
let slowly come to a boil. Add the fruit. Let come to a boil and with 
wooden spoon turn over the fruit. Put on top of stove and simmer slowly 
two hours. Set away to cool. Next day heat up syrup again to boiling 
point, add the fruit and when thoroughly heated seal. Julia J.

PRESERVED PEACHES. 

Select the yellow red-cheeked ones if possible (skin same as tomatoes, 
by pouring on boiling water then thrusting them in cold water and sep- 
arate in halves). Proceed as for preserved cherries only using three- 
fourths of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. Minerva Goss. 

SUN PRESERVED GOOSEBERRIES. 

Put into a quart pan six pounds of gooseberries with two pounds of 
sugar sprinkled over them and set the pan on the fire. Stir carefully; 
when the juice commences to come out take off the pan. Repeat this 
process for two days more; the second and third day add one pound of 
sugar, then take the gooseberries out of the syrup. Place on platters, 
boil the syrup till thick and pour over the fruit; place them to dry in the 
sun. In two days seal. Miss C. 

PRESERVED RED GOOSEBERRIES. 

They must not be picked until they are fully ripe. For each quart of 
the fruit take one-quarter of a pound of sugar and one gill of water. Boil 
together until a thick syrup, then put in the fruit and boil gently for fif- 
teen minutes. Next put them into small stone jars. When cold, cover 
them close. Keep them for making tarts or pies. Candace G. 

FIG CONSERVE. 

Figs preserved with lemon juice and ginger, pickled and spiced, make 
a delicious conserve. If the dried fruit is used the figs should be steamed 
first. F. E. P. 

TOMATO PRESERVES. 

Take as many sound red or yellow, plum-shaped tomatoes as desired 

to preserve, and weigh them. Wash and prick with a needle to prevent 

their bursting. Put the same number of pounds of sugar as of tomatoes 

over them. Let them stand over night. Next morning add enough 

water to cover them. Boil slowly until the fruit is clear and syrup is 

almost jellied. Before taking up add to each pound one lemon sliced. 

Leone Dickerson. 
TOMATO FIGS. 

Select small-sized, ripe tomatoes, either the red or yellow; scald and 
peal. To nine pounds of tomatoes add four pounds of brown sugar; cook 
slowly in the sugar without water till they are thoroughly preserved; then 
take out, spread on plates and dry in the sun. Pack them in layers with 
sugar sprinkled between. Tillie Barker,

PRESERVED PIPPINS. 

Twelve pounds of apples pared, cored and quartered, six pounds of 
sugar, one quart of water; make syrup of sugar and water; drop apples 
in this syrup and cook until tender; cloves and lemon peel may be added; 
stew till clear and seal. Amy Collins. 

CONSERVE OF ROSES. 

Gather each morning the roses which blossomed the day before, and 
after picking out the insects, stems, and calixes, throw the leaves into a 
jar with layers of powdered loaf or crushed sugar; do this while the roses 
last, crowd the jar full, and cover it very close. A very nice article is 
thus made to put into cakes, puddings, etc. H. E. S. 

SUN PRESERVED STRAW^BERRIES. 

(Excellent.) 

For every pound of fruit use a pound of sugar. Put the berries with 
sugar over the fire in a granite kettle, bring to a boil slowly. Turn over 
with wooden spoon. Cook one hour carefully. Take them out carefully 
with a skimmer. Put on platters; boil the juice a few minutes longer and 
pour over the fruit. Put in sun to dry, cover with netting during day and 
oilcloth at night. In a couple of days they will be ready to seal.

PRESERVED GRAPES. 

Select grapes that are fresh, ripe and sound. Pick off the stalks and 
weigh. To every pound of grapes allow three-fourths of a pound of sugar. 
Squeeze the pulp out of the skins in one bowl, putting the skins into 
another. Put the pulp into a granite pan and heat sufficiently so as to 
pass through a sieve, rejecting the stones; make syrup of the sugar adding 
just enough water to dissolve it. Put the pulp of the grapes into it and 
boil for five minutes, then let it cool, and seal. Alice Harper, 



PRESERVES, SPICED FRUITS, JELLIES AND 357 

PRESERVED LEMONS. 

Select moderately thick-skinned lemons, cut into halves and with a 
glass lemon-squeezer abstract the juice and save. Scrape out all the pulp 
throwing it away. Slice the peels in circles. Put them in cold water, 
leaving them for a day, changing the water four times, then put them 
into a saucepan with more cold water and boil slowly until tender. Pre^ 
pare a syrup, using about two pounds of sugar and one pint of water to 
each pound of peel, adding the juice of one lemon to every pound of fruit. 
Skim and let cool. Now put in the peels and boil for one-half hour. Seal.

CURRANT COHpStE FOR WINTER USE. 

Pick red currants from their stems, wash, drain and put one-half of 
them into a preserve dish. Press out the juice from the other one-half; 
mix in as much sugar as will be required to make a syrup, keeping it hot 
till the sugar is dissolved. When slightly cooled stir in the whole cur- 
rants. Heat and seal. Caterer. 

PRESERVED ORANGE PEEL. 

Weigh the fruit before paring and allow sugar, pound for pound. 
Peel the oranges very carefully and cut the rind into narrow shreds. 
Boil until tender, changing the water twice and filling up with hot from 
the kettle. Squeeze the strained juice of the orange over the sugar. Let 
this heat to a boil, put in the shreds and boil twenty minutes. Lemons 
can be done in the same manner. Mrs. J. A. Hayden. 

LEMON BUTTER. 

Three cupfuls of sugar, whites of three eggs and yolk of one, beaten; 
one and one-half cupfuls of butter; grate the yellow off of four lemons; 
then squeeze in the juice and cook twenty minutes in double boiler. Put

APPLE BUTTER. 

Fill a preserving pan with apples that have been peeled, quartered 
and cored. Add a slight flavoring of cloves, allspice and cinnamon. 
Cover with good cider, and boil slowly, stirring from time to time with a 
wooden spoon until the whole becomes a dark -brown jam, with only juice 
sufficient to keep it soft and buttery. Remove it from the fire and place 
in well-covered jars and in a few weeks it will be ready for use. It makes 
an excellent substitute for butter and is very wholesome for children.

JAM OF GREEN GAGES. 

Put ripe green gages into a kettle with very little water and let them 
stew until soft, then rub them through a sieve or colander, and to every 
pint of pulp put one pound of white sugar powdered fine; then put it in a 
preserving kettle over the fire, stir it until the whole is of the consistency 
of jelly, then take it off; put the jam into small jars or tumblers, and cover 
as directed for jelly. Any sort of plums may be done in this manner. 

Mrs. Sophia Doty. 
STRAWBERRY JAM. 

Mash the strawberries and for each cupful of berries allow a cupful 
of sugar. Boil one-half hour and seal in jars. Lizzie. 

FIG JAn. 

Take two pounds of figs, chop fine and cook with one pound of sugar 
and two cupfuls of water until thick; place in glasses and seal. 

Mrs. Grace Carpenter. 
DAMSON JAM. 

This is a fine jam for winter use, in tarts, roly-polys, etc. Gather the 
fruit on a dry, hot day. Pick over with great care, rejecting all that is 
blemished. Stone the fruit, weigh it, and allow three-quarters of a pound 
of loaf sugar to every pound of damsons. Place the fruit and sugar in 
preserving kettle (porcelain lined). Stir gently until the sugar is thor- 
oughly dissolved and carefully skim. After it commences to simmer all 
over alike boil it one hour. Stir it continually, as it sticks and burns 
quicker than most fruits, and that will give the jam a bitter flavor. When 
the jam is firm and the juice is set, it is done. Remove from the fire, put 
into small jars, cover it down, when quite cold, with oiled papers, and 
store it away in a dry place. Lottie McPhelan. 

GREEN RHUBARB JAn. 

Take one and one-half pounds of green rhubarb, one pound of loaf 
sugar, the thin rind of one-half of a large lemon, one-quarter of an ounce 
of bitter almonds and a little ginger. Wipe the rhubarb quite dry, cut it 
in pieces two inches long and put it into a preserving pan with the sugar 
broken small; the rind of the lemon must be cut very fine and the 
almonds blanched and divided. Boil the whole well together, stirring and 
skimming frequently, and when nearly done stir in the ginger. Young 
rhubarb will take about three-quarters of an hour but if old it must be 
boiled one and one-half hours. This preserve should be of a green color 
and will be found a very good substitute for greengage jam, resembling 
it very closely. Fanny Rice.

QRAPE JAH. 

Pulp the grapes. Put pulps on over the fire; use no water. After 
they begin to boil let them continue to boil gently one-half hour. Then 
strain them through a fine colander, so as to remove all the seeds. Then 
put pulps and skins into the kettle, adding two pounds of sugar to each 
three pounds of fruit. Cook this one hour, skimming constantl)'. Then 
fill the jars full, as for citron, never forgetting the rubbers. 

Mary Cordingly. 
RIPE RHUBARB JAM. 

Select fresh red rhubarb. The color red shows that it has grown in 
the sun and is much finer; cut in pieces one inch long, take sugar pound 
for pound. Cook together and let stand all night. In the morning pour 
off the syrup and boil it until it begins to thicken. Put in the rhubarb 
and heat. Ready for use. Alice McCarty. 

Jellies. 

HOW TO MAKE MOST KINDS OF JELLY. 

Place the fruit, currants, grapes, etc., in a porcelain kettle with just 
enough water to prevent burning. When thoroughly scalded strain 
through a flannel bag, using as much sugar as juice by measurement, place 
juice on stove alone and boil ten minutes. Add the sugar and boil ten 
minutes longer. Pour into small dishes. Cover with buttered writing 
paper and tie down with heavy paper, or instead of the buttered paper 
melted paraffine may be used. Caroline. 

APPLE JELLY. 

Select sound, red, fine-flavored apples not too ripe; wash, wipe and 
core; place in a granite kettle cover with water and let cook slowly until 
the apples look red. Pour into a muslin bag and drain; return juice to a 
clean kettle and boil one-half hour; skim. Now measure and to every 
pint of juice allow a pound of sugar; boil quickly for ten minutes. Red 
apples will give jelly the color of wine while that from light fruit will be 
like amber. Margaret McNolty. 

GREEN QRAPE JELLY. 

Select grapes that are just beginning to turn. Pick off the stems 
and wash in cold water. Now add one cupful of water to nine pounds of 
fruit. Stew until soft. Strain without squeezing through a muslin bag. 



362 PRESERVES, SPICED FRUITS, JELLIES AND JAMS.

a cupful of sugar; boil twenty minutes; pour into glasses. 

Mrs. T. Winchester. 
RIPE GRAPE JELLY. 

Take ripe (but not too ripe) grapes, put them into a saucepan and 
bruise them gently until the juice flows freely. Strain, without squeezing 
them, two 'or three times through muslin and, when clear, boil the juice 
rapidly for twenty minutes. Add a pound of loaf sugar to each pound of 
juice and boil till a little put on a plate will set. Put the jelly into jars 
and cover with buttered paper and afterwards with writing paper. 

Lulu Bailey. 
GREENING JELLY. 

Take greening apples, wash, quarter and core, but do not pare them. 
Cook until soft with one tumblerful of water in a granite pan; then put 
the apples in flannel bag and suspend over earthen dish and let drain 
several hours but do not squeeze. To one pint of juice add one pound of 
sugar; boil twenty minutes; then pour into jelly glasses. Mamie Betts. 

ASTRAKHAN JELLY. 

Fill a two-quart granite dish with alternate layers of pared and sliced 
apples and sugar. Bake three hours, closely covered. This is delicious 
and should turn out a solid pink jelly. Miss Lillie Wheeler. 

QUINCE JELLY, 

Do not pare but polish quinces smooth with a flannel cloth. Cut in 
small pieces, core and put all in a kettle. Pour over cold water to cover 
and boil until soft. Pour all into a flannel bag and hang up to drain care- 
fully, pressing occasionally to make the juice run more freely. To one 
pint of the juice add three-fourths of a pound of sugar and boil fifteen 
minutes. Pour into tumblers. Elsie Mackenzie. 

QUINCE AND APPLE JELLY. 

Tart apples to which have been added the cores and paring of quinces 
make a delightful jelly. Make as apple jelly. Margaret McNolty. 

RED PEPPER JELLY. 

Chop ripe red peppers and place in a granite pan and set in a kettle 
of cold water over a hot fire. Let boil until the juice is entirely extracted. 
To every pint of juice allow a pound of sugar and boil until it thickens. 
Put in small tumblers. Fine for cold meats. Lulu Jenkins.

ASPIC JELLY. 

Put a knuckle-bone of veal, a knuckle-bone of ham, a calf's foot, four 
cloves, stuck into one large onion, one large carrot and a bunch of savory 
herbs, into two quarts of water, and boil gently until it is reduced rather 
more than one-half. Strain and put aside to cool. Carefully remove 
every particle of fat or sediment, and place the jelly in a saucepan with a 
glass of white wine, a tablespoonful of best cider vinegar, salt and pepper 
to taste, and the whites of two eggs. Keep stirring until it nearly boils, 
which may be known by its becoming white, then draw it to the side of 
the fire and simmer gently for one-quarter of an hour. Put on the cover, 
let it stand to settle, and strain through a jelly bag two or three times if 
necessary, until it is quite clear. Put it into a mold which has been 
soaked in cold water. Mrs. Kate Bullard. 

ICELAND MOSS JELLY FOR INVALIDS. 

Wash four ounces of Iceland moss in warm water and having drained 
it set it over the fire in a quart of cold water. Stir until it boils, when it 
should be covered up and allowed to simmer for an hour. Add four 
ounces of sugar, a gill of sherry, the juice of two lemons, the rind of one- 
half of a lemon and the white of an egg whisked with one-half gill of cold 
water; stir the jelly until it boils and strain through a flannel bag. This 
moss is efficacious in cases of debility and chest complaints, but its bitter 
taste renders it disagreeable to some. L. Irish. 

ORANGE JELLY. 

Use the juice and rind of two oranges, one-half teacupful of sugar, 

enough water to dissolve one and one-half teaspoonfuls of gelatine. Boil 

ten minutes. Spread between the layers and frost the top if desired. 

Nannie. 
CRANBERRY JELLY.

RASPBERRY JELLY. 

Heat and strain as above. To each pint of juice allow one pint of 
sugar. Put the juice and sugar into a granite kettle, place over the fire 
and boil until it thickens, when a little is poured on a plate; carefully 
remove scum as it rises, pour the jelly into small glasses, cover and keep 
in a dry place. Amanda.

PLUM JELLY. 

(Wilder Cultivated.) 

Take plums not too ripe, put in a granite pan and set in a pan of water 
over the fire. Let the water boil gently till all the juice has come from 
the fruit, strain through a flannel bag and boil with an equal weight cf 
sugar twenty minutes. Mrs. Riley Carter. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Currants for jelly should not be over ripe. Put them into a granite 
pan and set in a kettle of hot water over the fire; keep the water boiling 
until the currants are all broken. Then drain. To each pint of juice allow 
one pound of sugar. Boil about twenty minutes. Pour into jelly glasses 
and seal when cool. Miss R. P. Perry. 

CRAB-APPLE JELLY. 

Select juicy apples. Mealy ones are no good. Wash and quarter and 
put into a preserving kettle over the fire with a teacupful of water. If 
necessary add more water as it evaporates. When boiled to a pulp strain 
the apples through a flannel bag, then proceed as for other jelly. 

F. E. C. 
PEACH JELLY. 

Pare the peaches, remove about one-half the pits. Place in a kettle 
with enough water to cover. Stir until the fruit is well cooked, then 
strain, and to every pint of the juice add the juice of one-half of a lemon; 
measure again, allowing a pound of sugar to each pint of juice. Boil and 
put up in the usual way. Tillie Buckman. 

ORANGE JELLY. 

Grate the rind of six oranges and three lemons into a granite kettle. 
Now squeeze in the juice, add one cupful of water and one-half pound of

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Cut two dozen oranges in halves, crosswise. With a glass lemon- 
squeezer extract the juice. Dig out the pulp and seeds, throwing them 
away. Soak the peelings over night in salt and water. In the morning 
rinse and boil peelings in clear water until tender, then chop and add 
juice. Weigh and add equal quantity of sugar. Let boil thirty minutes.

of lemons. Boil until thick and bottle. Mrs. Parker. 

GRAPE MARMALADE. 

Take sound grapes, heat and remove the seeds, then measure, and 
allow measure for measure of fruit and sugar. Place all together in a 
preserving kettle and boil slowly twenty-five minutes; add the juice of one 
lemon to every quart of fruit. Set away in jelly glasses. 

C. Marion Tulley. 
ORANGE riARMALADE— No. 2. 

This delicious preserve, which requires the greatest care in prepara- 
tion, is made chiefly of sweet oranges, when they are plentiful and in the 
best condition. Pare the outer rind from four oranges for every dozen 
pulped, and cut the rind up into small chips; scoop out the pulp, free from 
seeds, and the white inner skin, weigh the pulp and rind together before 
you put them into the preserving pan and have ready heated equal 
weight of loaf sugar; let the pulp and peel boil one-half hour, or till the 
chips are tender, then add the sugar and let it boil fifteen minutes longer; 
then fill the marmalade pots. Mrs. D. Day. 

APRICOT MARHALADE. 

Peel, quarter and stone four pounds of ripe apricots and put them 
into a preserving pan with neither water nor sugar; boil gently, stirring 
continually, until the fruit is reduced to a pulp. Then add three pounds 
of sugar, and a few of the kernels bknched and halved, and boil once

more. Put into jars, cover the fruit with an oiled paper and fasten over 
each jar a piece of thin paper dipped in gum water. When dry it will be 
light and hard. It should boil with the sugar, twenty minutes. 

Mrs. a. Place. 
ASTRAKHAN HARMALADE. 

Peel one dozen apples into small bits; put a piece of butter in a sauce- 
pan, with a small stick of cinnamon, the peel of a lemon, one-fourth of a 
pound of sugar and one-half cupful of water. Cover and cook for twenty- 
five minutes, watching that it does not burn; when dry take out the cinna- 
mon and lemon peel and beat thoroughly with a spoon to have it smooth, 
doing this on the hot fire so the apples thicken more and more until per- 
fectly firm. Pour into glasses and cover. Ione. 

MIXED MARMALADE. 

( Unsurpassed. ) 

Take equal quantities of white apples, yellow pears and white plums; 
pare and cut in small bits, stew in a little water till tender, then strain 
through a hair sieve. Now weigh the pulp and add to it, its own weight in 
sugar. Put on the stove and cook carefully three hours in a thick-lined 
granite kettle. Stir often the first two hours and continually the last 
hour. It is hard to make because it is easily burned but it always pays for 
the trouble. When thick turn into shallow pans and tie down. When 
desired for use slice off in slices and put on plate like cheese. Hilda. 

SPICED PLUMS. 

Four pounds of plums, two pounds of sugar, one tablespoonful each 
of cloves, cinnamon, mace and allspice; stone the plums, then put all 
ingredients into a preserving kettle; cover with vinegar; boil until tender. 

Mrs. Leone Hall. 
SPICED PEACHES.

pounds of prepared fruit, put into a porcelain kettle one quart of best 
cider vinegar, three pounds of brown sugar, one ounce each of whole 
cloves, whole allspice and broken cinnamon. Put in also the juice drained 
from the tomatoes and as much of the pulp as may be separated from the 
seeds through a fine sieve. Let them come to a boil; then add all, or all 
by parts, of the tomatoes — according to the size of the kettle — and let 
them boil just five minutes. Skim them out into a common stone crock, 
then boil the syrup down to a richness and turn it on the fruit in the 
crock. Let it cool, and set it away for use. It will be very good, but not 
so nice, without removing the seeds, which is the most troublesome part 
of the work. Mrs. M. Grant. 

SPICED CURRANTS. 

Wash and pick five pounds of red currants, add two tablespoonfuls of 
allspice, three pounds of granulated sugar, one pint of cider vinegar and 
one tablespoonful of powdered cloves and one tablespoonful of cinnamon. 
Stew gently for three hours. R. Eaton.

ANNED FRUITS ^ ?» 
^ ^ and VEGETABLES 

THERE are many methods to pursue in canning fruit. The main 
point is to see that the fruit is sound and of a good flavor; that the 
cans are sweet and the rubbers neither dry nor brittle and finally that the 
tops are screwed down air-tight. A good way to test the latter is to turn 
the can after it is filled bottom-side up to cool. If no juice escapes, you 
can feel sure that it is air-tight. 

A-i METHOD OF CANNING FRUIT. 

I give herewith the best method I have in my long experience ever 
known in canning fruit. It is not a new method but the "tried and not 
found wanting," is the best guide to follow, whether in canning fruit or in 
doing anything else in life. Make a syrup of one-half pound of granu- 
lated sugar and one-half cupful of water for every pound of fruit (less sugar 
may be used, if desired). Put the sugar in a granite kettle, pour on the 
water and let it dissolve. When dissolved put on the stove and boil 
slowly ten minutes. Watch to see that it does not burn. (If it needs 
clarifying see method on first page of "Preserved Fruits.") Now, while 
the sugar is being syruped get the fruit ready. First wash thoroughly the 
cans, rubbers and tops, fill the cans with the fruit within three inches of 
the top and stand them in the boiler leaving off the tops, putting on the 
bottom of the boiler some straw, excelsior or old cloths, so as to avoid 
the cans tumbling against each other and spilling their contents; then fill 
the boiler with cold water up to within one-quarter of the top of the cans. 
Now set on the stove and let the fruit graduallj'^ heat, putting in from 
time to time the amount of syrup allowed for each pound of fruit. Let 
water in boiler come to a boil and then cook until the fruit is thoroughly 
heated. Fill to top with syrup. Screw on the top and take boiler off the 
stove and let stand till nearly cold, then turn cans bottom-side up to see 
that no juice escapes. If none, the cans are air-tight and the fruit will be 
perfect and as nice in five years as in six months. Try it. 

Mrs. Mary Clark. 

METHOD FOR CANNING VARIOUS FRUITS. 

The simplest and most satisfactory cans to use are of glass, with glass 
or granite top Fill them by means of a funnel, just fitting into the neck

of the jar, so that no fruit will be wasted. The fruit should be perfectly 
fresh and sound and carefully picked over so that no ill flavor will impair 
its quality. The following formula is simple:

In canning peaches, if two or three are put in without removing the 
pits, a bitter almond flavor will pervade the whole can. 

Place a very wet hot cloth in the pan; set the jar on this, having 
rinsed them first in hot and then in cold water, place in it a silver spoon, 
put in the funnel and a cupful of syrup, then fill with fruit to the top. 
Remove the spoon and set the jar where no draft of air can strike it. 
Cover the fruit with syrup. In ten or fifteen minutes the contents of the 
jar will have cooled and settled some, and they will be ready to seal. Fill 
to the top with syrup or hot water; put on the top. When the jars are 
cold the top should be tightened again and set away in a cool, dark place. 
Some put a circular piece of paper on top of the jar before putting the 
cover on and think this prevents the mold that sometimes forms over the 
fruit. But if the cans stand till partially cool, and are then filled before 
being sealed, no mold will form. Julia Stevenson. 



WOLVERINE METHOD OF CANNING STRAWBERRIES. 

It is generally conceded that strawberries are the hardest fruit to keep 
we have. I suppose it is due to the amount of acid they contain and the 
season of the year in which they ripen. My method has never failed me. 
Try it: 

Select sound, fresh berries. Pick them over carefully and if neces- 
sary wash, but drain thoroughly and put them at once in the preserve 
kettle. To each pound of fruit add three-fourths of a pound of sugar; let 
them stand two or three hours, till the juice is drawn from them; pour the 
juice into the kettle and let them come to a boil, removing the scum which 
rises; now put in the berries; thoroughly scald, yes, even boil ten minutes, 



370 CANNED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. 

then put them in hot jars and seal while boiling hot. Turn can bottom- 
side up; if no juice escapes they will keep well. Mary Bornes. 

CANNED RASPBERRIES. 

(Illinois Recipe.) 

Take two pounds of berries to one pound of sugar. Stir in sugar 
before putting on the stove. Let them come to a good boil, then seal in 
glass jars. Mrs. L. Gregory. 

CANNED GRAPES. 

^Michigan Recipe.) 

Strange that so many have trouble canning grapes. I ask you to try 
my recipe: Squeeze the pulp from the skin; boil the pulp in one kettle, 
and the skins in another kettle, putting only a little water on each. 
When the pulp seems tender put through a colander, removing the seeds; 
now add the skins when tender, with the water in which they boiled and 
a large cupful of sugar for a quart of pulp and juice; boil ten minutes, 
stirring often, and can. M. C. Miller. 

CANNED PEACHES. 

(California Recipe.) 

Make a syrup of one-half pound of sugar and one-fourth of a cupful 
of water to every pound of fruit. Select large ripe yellow or white 
red-cheeked peaches; pare and divide in halves, take out stones from most 
of them; leave one now and then for the flavor. When ready drop them 
in the syrup and boil ten minutes. Seal while hot. 

Mrs. Martha Thompson. 

CANNED PINEAPPLE, 

(Florida Recipe.) 

Select sound fruit, pare and pick out the eyes, cut in thin slices cross- 
wise. Dig out center and tie in muslin bag and add to syrup; make syrup 
of three pounds of sugar and three pints of water to every seven pounds 
of fruit; boil syrup five minutes and skim, taking out muslin bag with 
cover. Now add the fruit and let it boil five minutes; have cans hot, fill 
and close up as soon as possible. As the cans cool, keep tightening up. 

Mrs. C. I. Berry. 

CANNED PINEAPPLE. 

(Uncooked.) 

One dozen pineapples; take out eyes, chop fine; to every pound of 
fruit one pound of sugar; put all together in large crock; let stand twenty- 
four hours, stirring occasionally. Fill your jars; screw down tight. 

Sarah Fuller. 



CANNED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. 371 

CANNED FRUIT JUICES. 

Many times it becomes desirable to use the juices of fruits for color- 
ing and flavoring and by putting these up in the fruit season they are 
always ready. Select sound ripe fruit, press out the juice, and strain 
through a flannel bag. To each pint of juice add one cupful of white 
granulated sugar. Put in a granite kettle, bring it to the boiling point and 
can while hot in small glass cans. Seal tight. Keep in dry dark place. 
Under the head of "Preserves" will be found several methods of preserv- 
ing these juices for winter use. Mary Bitner. 

CANNED MINCEMEAT. 

Mincemeat pies are so enjoyed by many people that they ask for them 
at all seasons of the year. I give here a recipe for canning mincemeat 
that, when opened, one, two, or three years later, it is found to be as good 
as when freshly made. Make and season the mincemeat (see Chapter, 
"Pies, Pastry, Etc.") and heat very hot, packing in glass jars and setting 
away in a dry, dark and cool place. One quart can will hold enough for 
two pies. Marion C. Howitt. 

CANNED BOILED CIDER. 

I was trained in girlhood to think that mince pies and fruit cake with- 
out boiled cider were unfit to eat. Many of the modern cooks use brandy 
instead but as I am a temperance advocate I still cling to the good 
boiled cider mince pie made by my grandmother. To enable one to have 
this at all times I herewith give my recipe for keeping it the year round. 
Place ten quarts of sweet cider in a granite kettle over the fire, boil it 
slowly until reduced to two quarts, carefully watching it that it does not 
burn; turn into glass jars while hot and seal tightly. Set away in dark 
dry closet. Auntie Brower. 

CANNED PLUMS. 

(California Style.) 

Canned plums arc much nicer when peeled. To peel them, pour on 
boiling hot water and let them slightly scald. When skins begin to 
break, pour off water and peel. Have ready a syrup made in the propor- 
tion of one pound of sugar to every four pounds of fruit and just enough 
water to dissolve sugar When all the plums are ready put them in the 
hot syrup and cook five minutes. Seal at once. Mrs. M. Butler. 

CANNED BLACKBERRIES AND BLUEBERRIES. 

Allow sugar and treat as for raspberries. Mrs. L. Gregory, 



372 CANNED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES, 

CANNED PEAS. 

(Iowa Recipe.) 

Take peas when at their best; select only those that are fresh and 
tender. Pod and fill the cans (glass) as full as possible by shaking. When 
no more peas will go in add enough clean cold water to nil up vacuum and, 
screw on tops fairly tight but not as tight as you would to put away. Leave 
room for gas to escape. Proceed to cook in cold water as described in 
recipe headed "A-i Method for Canning Fruit," only put water entirely 
over the can and boil three hours steady. Don't let water stop boiling 
once. Cans may be laid flat down on sides if desirable in canning 
vegetables as the covers are on and not off, as in fruit. Set in dry, dark 
closet. Mrs. Mary Clark. 

CANNED CORN. 

Take the corn when not too hard, fresh and sweet. Split the kernels 
lengthwise with a knife, then scrape with the back of the knife, thus leav- 
ing the hulls upon the cob. Fill glass cans full of corn, pressing very hard 
to get all the spaces filled up and the air crowded out. Use ten or eleven 
medium-sized ears, to fill a quart can. Put in no water but put on top, 
screw down and cook as described in canning peas. This method has 
never failed me. Early June peas are the best. Mrs. Mary Clark. 

CANNED TOriATOES. 

Select very ripe but sound tomatoes, remove skins by pouring on 
scalding hot water till the skins break. After removing skins put in a 
granite kettle without water and let slowly come to a boil. When they 
have boiled thirty minutes seal while hot, turn bottom-side up and when 
cold set in a dry, dark room. Mrs. Ione Davis. 

CANNED PUMPKIN. 

Squash and pumpkin can be canned in season for spring use and 
prove good as fresh. Take off the peel and cut up in small pieces, stew 
until tender, then mash very fine, adding no seasoning. Have ready glass

Dried Fruits. 

(Hygfienic and Economical.) 

The most healthful of all fruits put up for future use is the sun-dried 
fruit. This is especially true of prunes, apricots, apples, peaches, plums, 



CANNED FRUITS AND VEGETABLES. 373 

figs, raisins, gooseberries, and all other berries. It requires less sugar and 
is more healthful as well as economical. The sun cures fruit as no arti- 
ficial heat can. 

TO DRY PEACHES. 

Peel the peaches, divide in halves and remove the stone; allow one 
pound of sugar to three pounds of fruit; make a syrup of the sugar and a 
very little water; put in the peaches, a few at a time, and cook gently for 
fifteen minutes. Take them up carefully on platters, boil the juice until 
quite thick, pour on over the fruit and set in the sun to dry. When quite 
dry lay them lightly in a jar with a little sugar sifted between the layers. 

California Fruit Grower. 

TO DRY PLUMS. 

(Delaware Recipe.) 

Treat in same way as the peaches only do not remove the skins; 
simply halve and remove pits. C. F. G. 

TO DRY APPLES. 

(Missouri Recipe.) 

Pare, remove core, and cut in slices crosswise or cut into quarters and 
eighths; dry partly and then pack them in jars, spreading sugar between 
the layers. Tie down and they will keep well and be excellent for pies or 
sauce. They may also be thoroughly sun dried without sugar and put 
away for use. Missouri Farmer. 

DRIED GOOSEBERRIES. 

To five pounds of ripe gooseberries add ten pounds of sugar. Scald

CIDER or maple sugar vinegar should be used for pickles unless other- 
wise called for. If the vinegar is too strong dilute with water. 
Boil pickles, when possible, in porcelain-lined or stone vessels, never 
in metal. 

Pickles of all kinds kept in open jars should be stirred occasionally, 
and if there are soft ones among them they should be taken out and the 
vinegar scalded and turned back hot. If weak, new vinegar should be 
heated and turned on instead. 

CUCUHBER PICKLES FOR WINTER USE. 

The best way to put down cucumbers for winter use, especially when 
a panful or so are gathered at a time, is to wash and put them in a crock 
or barrel. First, a layer of cucumbers, then one of rock salt (enough salt 
to make sufficient brine to cover them, no water), cover with a cloth; keep 
them under the brine with a heavy board and a weight on top; each time 
more fresh cucumbers are added take out those already in brine, putting 
the new ones at the bottom; rinse the cloth every time you put in fresh 
cucumbers, as a scum will rise and settle upon it. Use plenty of salt and 
the pickles will keep one year. To prepare pickles for use, soak in luke- 
warm water, changing it three times a day, and keep in a warm place until 
they are fresh enough, then pour plain or spiced vinegar over and let them 
stand twenty-four hours, then pour that off and put on fresh. In gather- 
ing cucumbers cut them off the vines with shears. Pulling or twisting them 
off injures the vines. Marion Miller. 

CUCUHBER PICKLES FOR 5UnnER USE. 

Take of small-sized fresh cucumbers as many as desired for summer 
use; put them in strong salted water over night; take out of the brine, 
wipe dry and cover with strong vinegar; in two or three days they are 
ready for use. Mrs. Sadie Webb. 

SPICED CUCUMBER PICKLES. 

Use only very small cucumbers, taking a peck, and washing them 
clean. Put in a stone jar and make a brine of two pounds of coarse dairy 
salt and pour over them. They should stand in this brine thirty-six hours 

374 



PICKLES, VINEGAR AND BRINE. 376 

Then take them out, throw away the brine, put cucumbers into a pan and 
cover them with boilnig- water. Let stand ten minutes in this water, take 
them out and drain them one hour. Put in jar, cut up four peppers, mix- 
ing them well through them. Boil one gallon of vinegar slowly fifteen 
minutes, adding whole peppers, mace and cloves, one-half ounce of each. 
Then skim out spices, and pour vinegar over cucumbers hot. Cover with 
a plate and a stone to weigh it down and cover jar with another plate. 
Don't disturb them for a week or so. Mrs. Maria Gillespie. 

SWEET CUCUMBER PICKLES. 

Take twelve large green cucumbers, cut in slices one-half inch thick 
and soak in weak salt water for an hour. Make a thick syrup of one 
coffee-cupful of granulated sugar, one teacupful of vinegar; tie up two 
teaspoonfuls each of cinnamon and cloves in a piece of muslin; boil all to 
a thick syrup, then drain the cucumbers; rinse well in clear water and add 
to the syrup; set them back on the range and simmer gently for three 
hours. A. R. Hornsworth. 

RIPE CUCUMBER PICKLE5 (SOUR). 

Take twelve large, ripe, yellow cucumbers, cut in halves, take out all

next morning rinse them well in clear water, drain and wipe as dry as 
possible, placing them in jar. Have one-half dozen red peppers prepared 
by removing seeds and cut in small, narrow pieces; have also one fresh 
horseradish, prepared in same way, in small pieces, and about one pound 
of mustard seed, sprinkle all these in between the slices of cucumbers; 
have enough boiling hot vinegar to cover same and pour over. On the 
third morning scald vinegar again, adding an extra quantity if it seems 
weak, and they are ready for use when cold. They can be put away in 
glass bottles on the third morning. Belle Locke. 

RIPE CUCUMBER PICKLES (SWEET). 

Pare and seed large ripe cucumbers Slice each cucumber crosswise

four hours. Drain once more, then put them in a syrup of one pint of 
vinegar with one pound of sugar and one ounce of cassia buds, a few 
sticks of cinnamon and a few cloves. Boil all together twenty minutes.

PICKLED WATERMELON RINDS. 

Pare the rinds (cutting off the colored portion of the inside) and cut- 
ting the pieces into strips till you have a ten-quart pail full. Cover them 
with cold water in which are thrown bits of alum sufficient to give the 
water a strong alum taste. It will require three quarts of vinegar. Soak 
over night, then drain well and to each pint of vinegar allow a cupful of 
sugar; a scant tablespoonful each of cinnamon, cloves and allspice. If 
allspice is disliked for the dark color it gives, use nutmeg— a nice oppor- 
tunity for pounding up the bits saved from the nutmeg grater. Boil the 
vinegar and sugar together, skim well, and throw in the rinds, covering 
them with a large plate. They should boil till they can be easily pricked 
with a silver fork. When half through the boiling throw in the spice 
bags. Pour all into a jar; to keep them from floating lay plates over the 
vinegar. They will be as good the second summer as the first. 

Mrs. Farmer. 

EAST INDIA PICKLE.

QUICK WAY TO PEEL PEACHES FOR PICKLING. 

In peeling small peaches with a knife too much of the peach is 
wasted; take instead a wire basket, fill it with peaches and dip it into 
boiling water, for a moment, then into cold water for a moment and empty; 
continue in the same way for all. This toughens the skin and enables 
you to strip it off, saving much in labor and also the waste of peach. Why 
not, as well as tomatoes? L. B. 

PICKLED SWEET APPLES.

There are many kinds of vinegars; those used for pickling and those 
used for flavoring. Pure cider vinegar and pure maple sugar vinegar are 



PICKLES, VINEGAR AND BRINE. 385 

generally considered the most healthful. To impart an acid, however, to 
most of the commonly-used side dishes I would suggest, where practicable, 
the use of lemons. The latter is perfectly healthy, being a pure fruit 
product and as ii has not undergone the process of fermentation it natu- 
rally commends itself to every housewife who looks after the hygiene of 
the family. A. C. C. 

HOME-MADE TABLE VINEGAR. 

Put in an open cask four gallons of good cider and one gallon of 
molasses; cover the top with thin muslin and leave it in the sun, covering 
it up at night and when it rains. In four weeks it will be good vinegar. 
If cider cannot be obtained use rainwater although it will take longer, 
probably four or five weeks, to make a very sharp vinegar. 

N. M. Heinz. 
STRONG CIDER VINEGAR FOR PICKLING. 

Take three gallons of good cider and mix thoroughly with three 
pounds of honey or brown sugar, pour into a cask and let stand for six 
months. Vinegar will then be so strong as to make it necessary to dilute 
for table use. N. M. Heinz. 

HONEY VINEGAR. 

Mix in the proportion of eight quarts of warm water to one quart of 
honey. Let it stand in a warm room or in the sun until it passes through 
the stage of fermentation. A fine white vinegar will form. E. So F. 

TARRAGON VINEGAR.

Put into a jar four ounces of grated horseradish, one teaspoonful of 
cayenne, two teaspoonfuls of salt, and one tablespoonful of mustard; 
pour over them one quart of boiling vinegar and set the covered jar by 
the fire for two weeks; then boil up the vinegar, let it cool, strain through 
a jelly bag and bottle. It is an excellent relish for salads, cold meats, etc. 

R. E. S. 
MAPLE SUGAR VINEGAR. 

Put into an open cask the scraping of maple sugar, odd bits of maple 
syrup and the rinsings of granite pans in which has been cooked maple jl 
syrup; add a little warm water and let stand in the sun covered with a 
gauze until it ferments. D. Z. 

ECONOMICAL VINEGAR. 

Save the sound cores and the parings of apples used in cooking. Put 
into a jar, cover with cold water, stand in a warm place, add one-half pint 
of molasses to every two gallons. Cover the jar with gauze; add more 
parings and cores occasionally. This will make good vinegar. 

H. F. L. 

SPICED VINEGAR. 

One gallon of cider vinegar, one pound of sugar, one tablespoonful of 
allspice, three tablespoonfuls of mustard seed, three tablespoonfuls of 
celery seed, two tablespoonfuls of salt, one tablespoonful of cinnamon, 
and one teacupful of grated horseradish. F. E. P. 

RASPBERRY VINEGAR. 

Put one pound of ripe red or black raspberries into a granite bowl and 
pour upon it a quart of the best white wine vinegar; next day strain the 
liquor off the raspberries; the following day do the same but do not squeeze 
the fruit. Put all together and bottle. M. B. C. 

CELERY VINEGAR FOR FLAVORINGS. 

One quart of fresh celery, chopped fine, one quart of cider vinegar; 
one tablespoonful of salt and one of brown sugar. Put the celery in a jar, 
heat the vinegar, sugar and salt; pour boiling hot over the celery, let 
cool, cover it tightly and set away. In two weeks strain and bottle. One- 
fourth of a pound of celery seed can be substituted instead of the fresh ' 
celery if more convenient. M. A. I. 



PICKLES, VINEGAR AND BRINE 387 

Pickle of Brine. 

TO PRESERVE BEEF. 

First, let it get thoroughly cold and firm, then rub salt into it and let 
remain for twenty-four hours. This draws off the blood. Next drain, 
and pack it in a brine prepared as follows: For every one hundred pounds 
of beef use seven pounds of salt, one ounce each of saltpetre and cayenne 
pepper, one pint of molasses, ten gallons of soft water. Boil and skim 
well, when cool pour it over the beef. Keep in this until ready for use. 
The brine should be boiled up occasionally and scummed. 

A. Granger. 
TO CURE HAMS. 

To every one hundred pounds make a brine of eight pounds of coarse 
salt, two ounces of saltpetre, two pounds of brown sugar, one ounce of 
potash and four gallons of water. First, let the hams get thoroughly cold, 
say two days after butchering; rub them all over with fine salt; then pour 
over them the brine. Let remain six weeks in the brine, then take out 
and dry several days before smoking. N. K. Brooks. 

A PICKLE FOR HAM, BEEF, TONGUE, BACON, ETC. 

Take three or four hams weighing fourteen or sixteen pounds each. 
Let them hang for a day, then rub well into each one two ounces of sal 
prunella, two ounces of saltpetre, and one pound of salt. Put the hams 
into a deep pan and turn them over and rub them each day for three 
days. Make a pickle by boiling together three gallons of water, four 
pounds of common salt, four pounds of bay salt, and seven pounds of 
moist sugar. Skim thoroughly, and when the pickle has boiled for twenty 
minutes, pour it hot over the meat. The hams must be rubbed and turned 
daily, and their relative position altered, the one at the top being put to 
the bottom, and so on. At the end of three weeks they must be drained 
and dried, and smoked if practicable. This pickle will be found excellent 
for beef, bacon, tongues, etc., and will keep for several months if it be 
boiled and skimmed each time it is used, and kept closely corked. Salt 
and treacle should be added also to make up for the strength evaporat- 
ing. E. J. C. 

TO SALT PORK. 

Let the pork get thoroughly cold and hard, put in a boiler as much 
water as will well cover pork to be preserved. When it boils, mix in salt. 
To ascertain when there is salt enough put in an ^g^ — if it floats there is 
sufficient. Pour the brine in a jar and let it cool. When cold pour over 
the pork. C^ A. S. 




EAT AND FISH SAUCES 

AND GARNISHINGS. 

SAUCES accompanying various meats should increase its palatableness 
and yet, very many fail in this matter. Some one has said that the best 
test of a good cook is good gravy. There are four qualities demanded in 
the composition of a good sauce or gravy. First, is its color: it should 
be attractive to the eye; second, it should be pleasing in its aroma; third, 
pleasing in flavor and fourth, consistency. The simplest way to make a 
gravy or sauce is to remove the meat from the pan, pour or skim off the 
fat, leaving the residue in the pan. Then, add a little hot water or milk, 
stirring all thoroughly. Next strain the liquid, season to taste and it is 
ready for use — a clear, bright substance, free from fat. 

When a sauce is intended to be served hot, it should be kept so, and 
the best method to insure this is to place the vessel in which the sauce has 
been made in another one containing hot water. This prevents further 
boiling, but keeps the right degree of heat. Sauces, gravies, etc., are 
better made in an enameled saucepan. Below are given recipes for the 
making of all the favorites. 

DRAWN BUTTER SAUCE. 

Put in a saucepan two generous tablespoonfuls of butter, add two 
tablespoonfuls of flour and stir; pour in a pint of boiling water, add a little 
salt and pepper. Simmer for twenty minutes until it thickens, then add 
gradually one-half tablespoonful of butter, beating until it becomes white. 
Stir well, strain and serve. Celia McDonald. 

CREAM SAUCE. 

Put into a saucepan one tablespoonful of flour and two tablespoonfuls 
of butter, place over a slow fire and stir lightly for two minutes, adding a 
pinch of sugar and salt and one teacupful of cream. Stir well again for 
two minutes, to avoid its coming to a boil. Serve at once. Inez Hall.

of the sediment in the dish mix with it. Stir in a little salt and send to 
the table in a dish that has been heated. Mrs. Mary Holland.

The powder for this sauce can be procurea ready at most druggists. 
To make the sauce take one tablespoonful of butter, one tablespoonful of 
flour, one teaspoonful of curry-powder, a large slice of onion, a large cup- 
ful of stock, salt and pepper to taste. Cut the onion fine and fry brown in 
the butter. Add flour and curry-powder. Stir a minute, add the stock,

boiled. Mrs. Maude Williams. 

CRANBERRY SAUCE. 

Put the berries, after picking over and washing, into a saucepan just 
covered with water and stew slowly over a good fire. Stir often, mashing 
the fruit all you can. When they are mashed, which will take about one- 
half hour, take them from the fire and add the sugar (nearly a pound to a 
quart of berries) stirring it till it has all dissolved. Press all the fruit 
through a coarse sieve, and put what passes through into a dish or mold.

cream into a clean stew-pan, mix the reduced stock very gradually with 

it, and stir all the time over a slow fire until it thickens. If the ordinary 

thin cream be used mix a tablespoonful of arrowroot very smoothly into

pure salad oil. The oil should be put in first in drops, and afterwards in 
teaspoonfuls and the sauce should be well beaten between each addition.

curdling. When the oil is thoroughly incorporated, add three dessert- 
spoonfuls of best vinegar and one of chilli vinegar. Mrs. S. Lampin.

parsley, salt and pepper to taste and two thin slices of lemon cut in quarters. 
Fry until a light brown color. A nice garnish for game. J. C. 

QARNISH FOR SALADS. 

Garnish for salads is spoken of more at length under Salads — both 
meat and vegetable — but it is not out of place to add here that hard-boiled 
eggs sliced or cut lengthwise are a most appropriate as well as appetizing 
finish to the ornamenting of a salad. Beets boiled and cut dice shape, 
capers and powdered cheese, all add to the looks and therefore flavor. 

Mrs. Gregory. 

QARNISH FOR PUDDINGS. 

It is generally understood by all housewives that desserts and pud- 
dings of all kinds are more appetizing in looks, and hence more palatable, 
when they come on the table in an attractive manner. Steamed plum 
puddings when in mold and reversed on a pudding platter and scattered 
over with a few plums halved, a cherry pudding strewed with a few fresh 
or candied cherries, or a shortcake the inside of which is filled with slightly 
crushed berries, is greatly enhanced in looks when surrounded with a few 
elegant, large, juicy-looking berries. It is not always the elaborate con- 
coction of a dish that strikes home to the heart; but the beauty and the 
simplicity. Mrs. Gregory,

MOST persons to-day who reside in large cities and have means at 
command endeavor, during the heated season, to get away for a 
few weeks to the country, seashore, mountains or inland lakes where 
good, wholesome living and pure air can be enjoyed. "Roughing it" has 
become quite a fad and when we consider that the idea includes not only 
change of location, but change of dress, healthy exercise and simple liv- 
ing, we must all admit that it is a good thing for mankind. Scores, in 
flocking hither, camp out or build cottages, others accept the hospitality 
offered by the "Summer Hotels," an institution made necessary by the 
advance of time. 

HOW TO ARRANGE THE STOVE. 

In camping out the most important thing aside from the tent is the 
stove. The top of a common cooking stove with stove pipe to fit is just 
the thing, although stoves can be purchased on purpose for camping at a 
cost of three or four dollars. Dig out a hole in the bank the size and 
shape of the stove and line all with stones except the front. Regulate the 
draught by placing something in front for a blower. Some prefer the 
gasoline or oil stoves. 

Coffee and tea pots should not have spouts, but lips; and the lips 
should be riveted on, as as not to melt off. Tin plates and cups can be 
kept clean by occasionally scouring them with ashes or sand. 

PROVISIONS FOR CAMP LIFE. 

These will depend much upon the locality and the requirements of 
the campers; the following suggestions may be serviceable in making up 
an outfit: 

Plenty of wheat, rye and graham flour, also corn-meal. Bacon, 
smoked ham, bologna sausage, eggs, dried beef, salt fish. Crackers, 
canned fruit and vegetables, where fresh cannot be obtained. Potatoes^

404 HOW AND WHAT TO COOK WHEN CAMPING OUT. _. 

beans, onions, molasses, salt, pepper, sugar, mustard, vinegar, lard, but- 
ter, coffee, tea, chocolate, rice, oat-meal, baking-soda, ginger, soap: 
kerosene oil and candles. 

NECESSARY UTENSILS. 

The necessary utensils are coffee pot, spiders, kettles, bakers, gridiron, 
basins, cups, pails, knives, forks, spoons, lanterns, ropes, bags, strings, 
needles, thread, matches, shovel, axe, hammer, nails, fishing tackle, 
gun and ammunition, towels and flannel clothing. 

Most of the recipes in other parts of this book are appropriate for 
camp life but we give under this head a few that are especially appro- 
priate for out-door cooking. 

In camp life small and large birds should be either roasted, stewed or 
broiled. Pick off the feathers and draw them. Wash carefully. If for 
roasting, tie the legs down and place in the pan. Sprinkle with flour, 
cover the bottom with water and roast thirty minutes. Oven must be 
very hot. A. M. Johnson. 

BIRDS ROASTED IN THEIR FEATHERS. 

(Hunter's Style.) 

Open the bird in the usual manner, and draw; then cover with wet 
clay and bury in hot coals. In forty-five minutes draw from the coals and 
peel off the clay. Feathers and skin will come at same time. Delicious 
cooked in this manner. A. M. J. 

STEWED PATRIDGES, PIGEONS OR GROUSE. 

Place two partridges in a small kettle and dredge with salt, pepper 
and flour and cover with cold water. Cover tight and let simmer two 
hours. Thicken with flour and stir in two spoonfuls of catsup; simmer 
one hour longer, and serve. A. M. J. 

BROILED BIRDS. 

Split and clean; wipe and broil over a hot fire — if small, ten minutes; 
if large, fifteen. Season with salt, pepper and butter. Serve on toast. 

A. M. J. 
FISH BAKED IN THEIR SCALES. 

Take out the insides, wash and close up again, first seasoning a little 
with salt. Leave on the head, fins and scales. Cover with wet clay and 
bury in hot coals and bake one hour. The time depending, of course, 
upon the size, a longer time for a larger fish. When done peal off the 
clay (at which time the scales will also come off), open up, lay flat on the 
back and lift out the bones. Then take off the head, season, and it is 
ready to serve. It is unequaled in flavor. William H, Brooks. 



jffOW ANJ^ WHAT TO COOK WHEN CAMPING OUT 405 

BROOK TROUT. 

(Angler Style.) 

If you cook brook trout as the angler does, split to the tail and clean. 
Wash and drain. For a dozen large trout fry six slices of salt pork 
brown, take out and put in the trout. Fry a nice brown and serve with 
the pork. Louis Hamilton. 

CLAn-BAKE. 

A party of twenty will require a bushel of clams, which should be 
gathered, if possible, the day before. Leave on the shell, place in a tub 
and cover with clean water. Into the water throw about one quart of 
Indian meal. This fattens them. When time to use wash thoroughly in 
two or more waters. Clean one fresh cod nicely, season with salt and pep- 
per, and wrap in a clean cloth. Clean also a live lobster. Wash plenty 
of potatoes, cut off the ends, peel a generous lot of onions, husk some 
green corn (leaving on the inner husk to keep it clean) and all is ready for 
the oven. 

Make the oven of flat stones placed together in the form of a square, 
about two and one-half feet each way; around the inside of this place 
other stones to form a bin. Fill this bin with small sticks. On these pile 
larger sticks, crosswise, and on top of these a layer of stones. Start the 
fire, allowing it to burn down until the stones which are on top settle into 
the coals. Clean out quickly all the cinders with a poker, then cover the 
stones with a green seaweed about one and one-half inches thick. Have 
ready the clams, spread them on top of the seaweed, then the vegetables, 
then the fish and a live lobster. Cover the whole with a piece of cotton 
cloth to keep out dirt; then cover with seaweed until no steam can escape. 
Bake thirty-five minutes. Remove the covering from one corner at a 
time only — so that the rest may keep hot — and all hands take hold and 
help themselves. J. Jefferson. 

BEAN^BAKE. 

(Outing Style.) 

Build an oven in much the same way as for a clam-bake, except have 
It round and of a size to accommodate a large iron kettle in which the 
beans are to be baked. Prepare the coals as also for clam-bake and have 
ready five or six quarts of beans, as the case may be, cleaned, parboiled 
and seasoned with salt, pepper and molasses. In the center and on top 
of the beans, place two pounds, more or less, of good salt pork cross cut. 
Now^ put the kettle, with cover, containing the beans on the live coals, 
cover up with fresh grass and let cook fifteen hours Have ready some

CORN DODGERS. 

Take three teacupfuls of corn-meal, one teaspoonful of salt, one table- 
spoonful of sugar, and pour on boiling water enough to wet it; then make 
into small, flat cakes about one inch thick, and fry fifteen or twenty min- 
utes in boiling fat. To be eaten very hoi. Fine. John Smith.

then beat in one q^^. Spread one-half inch deep on buttered tins and 
bake brown in a quick oven. Delicious. Mrs. John Smith. 

R0A5T POTATOES. 

"Of all the potatoes I ever tasted," said Stanley, on his return trom an 
outing trip in Michigan, "roasted potatoes are the best." Let the coals get 
red hot, cover with hot ashes and lay on one dozen or more (with jackets 
on, but clean) as the needs of the company require, and over them put on 
more ashes and then red-hot coals. Let stand twenty-five minutes. Take 
out, wipe clean, crush open and drop in a speck of butter and sprinkle 
with salt. Try them, I did and they are fine. Stanley's Mother.

WHAT HAKES HEALTH? 

IT IS a matter of no small importance 
that we well consider the subject- 
how can we best supply the human family 
with a food that will perform the mission ol 
strengthening and at the same time the mis- 
sion of enriching life? 

Vegetarianism has, from the first, steadily 
pursued its way, making no loud boasts, 
but drawing converts to its theories until to-day there are hundreds in 
every state in the Union. Vegetarians build their theory on the single 
fact that all nutritive matter is formed by vegetables; that although 
animals appropriate nutrition they never form it, and that when men eal 
animal food, they take on the unhealthy conditions of the very animal 
they feed upon. 

People say that man requires a certain amount of fat. Well, so h«i. 
does, but here again comes the vegetarian who says that " the vegetable 
world furnishes it generously. Seeds and nuts have been found far supe 
rior to animal fats." 

Flesh eaters also bring forward the argument that animal food musi 
be more readily assimilated than vegetable, because the people who liv«' 
upon it are generally fleshy. This the vegetarians claim is a false theory 
To be well nourished is to replenish tissues, not to accumulate fat. The 
increase of flesh beyond a proper amount becomes a disease, and they ask 

408 



HEALTH PARAMOUNT TO ALL ELSE. 409 

if " it is not a fact that thin people will endure illness far better than those 
whose adipose tissue is extreme?" 

From a humane point as Avell as a health point of view, vegetarianism 
has made many converts. Thousands who are not quite ready to declare 
themselves vegetarians have diminished their use of meat very materially 
within the last year. By this means, a demand for fruits, cereals, vege- 
tables and nuts has sprung up that we hope will bring its reward in 
increased health and greater mental activity. 

It is true that the whole earth teems with fine food and it will ever 
yield bounteously to her children. No article of diet supplies nutriment 
so cheaply and with less trouble than cereals and vegetables. Take, for 
instance Indian corn. At the time America was discovered the inhabitants 
lived almost exclusively upon this cereal. Rice furnishes more human 
beings nourishment than any other article in existence. In the vegetable 
world, there need be no adulterations. The articles can be produced in 
such quantities that they should continue to be pure and within the reach 
of all. 

Fruits, of which there is a bewildering variety, have a large place in 
the list of health preservers. Every fruit contains substances designed 
to inspire and humanize Its votary. The juices are cool and healing and 
greatly assist In digestion. 

Nuts also are nature's choicest food products, and were doubtless 
intended by the creator to constitute, with fruits, man's chief diet. Man's 
greatest burden bearer — the horse — by nature lives solely on a vegetable 
diet. It hauls heavy loads with no seeming effort. DeLesseps said that 
the Suez Canal, a wonderful achievement, could never have been built by 
any meat-eating people In the world. The climate being hot, they could 
not have endured It. The work was accomplished by Armenians, who 
live most upon barley. DeLesseps himself became a vegetarian and 
remained so during his life. The elephant, the strongest of all animals, 
lives entirely upon plant life, and so we might go on, but suffice It to say 
that vegetarianism is bound to grow and the quicker we spare the blessed 
lambs and innocent calves, the healthier and happier we will be. 

At first the change in diet from meats to vegetables will perhaps seem 
difficult but if persisted in one will be able to say with a prominent vege- 
tarian, "I had been considerable of a vulture, and for some tim.e after 
eliminating flesh from my menus I had desire for it. But gradually that 
desire faded, and there came in Its stead a growing horror of flesh. After 
a few weeks of fruits and vegetables there came over me a feeling of 
exultation and superiority and erispness that was truly novel" 




410 HEALTH PARAMOUNT TO ALL ELSE. 

HOMEKEEPINQ NOT HOUSEKEEPING. 

"Oh, to be strongi each morn to feel, 

A fresh delight to wake to life. 
To spring with bounding pulse to meet 

Whate'er of work, of care, of strife 
Day brings to mel each night to sleep 

The dreamless sleep that health can give 
No weary ache, no wearing pain — 

Ah, then indeed, 'twere joy to live. 

What a ringing chorus of joy and ecstacy 
would swell up to heaven, if the many thou- 
sands who are suffering could toss aside their aches and pains and sing 
the glad song of returning health. Every woman desires to be beauti- 
ful, yet, where is beauty , without health? Strange to say, health is 
within the reach of all if the simplest rules of every-day life be observed. 
Let us remember the adage: "We do not live upon what we eat, but 
upon what we digest." When we ignore our natural instincts, which 
are satisfied with the proper amount of food and continue to impose extra 
duties upon the stomach, the first step is taken toward destroying health. 
We can well learn a lesson from the animals — none of the animal king- 
dom ever eats except when it is hungry and as soon as it has consumed 
suflficient to gratify that hunger, it cannot be tempted to continue Its 
repast. 

The mothers, the real homekeepers, are coming to the front in that, 
as in all the other grand reforms of our progressive age. They are 
studying the subject of the relations of food, exercise and ventilation to 
health, and are becoming acquainted with the methods by which nutri- 
ment is best introduced into the system, and are exercising a sensible 
supervision over the food of their children. When an author makes the 
assertion and proves it — that the nature and character of the man or 
woman has a close relation to what the child was fed upon, it Is a truth 
that will strike home to the mother's heart. 

Every mother in the land should learn something of the chemistry ot 
cooking. This knowledge would not only enable her to keep her family 
In health, but would teach them how to take care of themselves. How 
often it is true that a mother studies every other method of bringing up 
her children in a successful way, but neglects their food? A mother who 
looks well after these things may truly be called a Homekeeper. Home- 
keeping and housekeeping should go hand in hand — but it seems as 



HEALTH PARAMOUNT TO ALL ELSE

Lillian Whiting says in the World Beautiful that the two "have gotten 
sadly taken, — one for the other. The finest and most liberal culture is 
none too fine to fit a woman for homekeeping; but mere industry and 
trained intelligence is the basis of housekeeping The woman unlearned 
in art, literary or social culture, may be a most admirable housekeeper; 
but the highest and greatest gifts and the most exquisite cultivation are 
none too much for homekeeping." 

We have here endeavored to pay some attention to food values, sup- 
plying the elements required by the system. Cream, butter and nuts fur- 
nish the fats to those who do not eat meat. Fruit gives the acids. 
Cereals and vegetables the brain and muscle. 

NOURISHING PROPERTIES OF VARIOUS FOODS. 

In the hope of arousing and cultivating intelligent interest in respect 
to the nutritive value of the most common articles of food, I present the

"Let us be thankful, not only that we are alive, but that everything 
else is alive," said Dr. Kellogg, in announcing that there M^ould be no tur- 
key, no animal food of any kind, at a recent Thanksgiving dinner of the 
Battle Creek sanitarium. 

People who have never thought upon this subject doubtless think that 
such a feast would not be a Thanksgiving feast, and especially so as every 
form of animal food was also excluded; but there are many thousands of 
very intelligent persons who did the same thing. Yes, there are many

strict vegetarians in our broad land to-day. Doubtless a large number 
have drawn their inspiration from the above institution. In order to 
show what a grand dinner can be made of vegetable foods, and to furnish 
suggestions for those who may desire to adopt, at least in a small measure, 
the vegetarian diet, I give the menu of the above dinner:

If any one will examine a half-dozen typical, well-ordered vegetarian 
menus, he will agree with us, after examining the same, that it is possible 
to prepare a good menu without the use of meats. To illustrate this fact, 
and to assist those who may be interested in the subject, I give place to a

^*^ ,., HOW TO SERVE THEM. 

\fff 11 i^ TTRESH fruits may safely be said to be nature's panacea 

/ 1 for many of the ills under which humanity labors. 

Every fruit that grows contains properties especially needed by our 
race. At one time fruit upon the table was deemed a luxury designed 
solely for the wealthy or people of moderate circumstances on 
special occasions. To-day fruit is a necessity and from no well-set 
table is it absent. Each variety of fruit has its own health-giving 
properties — all conducive to happiness and long life. In them is 
stored up elements that assist digestion, refresh the brain, invigor- 
ate the body, and why should we go without — when fresh fruit 
of some sort can be obtained so cheaply? Physicians now heartily 
recommend a fruit diet to their patients, and were it to constitute half of 
the daily diet, intemperance and many other evils would be much less- 
ened. We can personally vouch for a case of a young man who had 
become addicted to the use of intoxicants. A friend advised him to try 
the use of oranges before breakfast. He ridiculed but followed his 
advice, with the result that he became a convert to the fruit diet, and 
when a craving for alcoholic stimulants" arose, he resorted to the imme- 
diate use of some sort of fruit, and no longer cared for what had been his 
bane. As he expressed It, fruit "became meat and drink" to him. 

There is no better tonic in the world than the juice of one-half of a 
lemon squeezed into a cupful of hot or cold water, drank without sugar, 
on rising in the morning. Headaches, languor, biliousness all disappear. 
We not only have our native fruits to draw from, but eveiy country on 
earth contributes its choicest fruits, and when their value Is more gener- 
ally understood, the good effect upon the manners and morals of the 
world will be nroductive of arrander lives, clearer brains and fewer ail- 
ments than now 



416 FRESH FRUITS. 

TO PRESERVE APPLES FOR WINTER USE. 

Keep the apples on open shelves in a cool dark attic that is airy. It 
is preferable to the cellar, which is often too damp. Use the spotted and 
decaying ones first to preserve the others as long as possible; if preferred 
they may be packed in clean, dry straw so they will not touch each other. 
Still another way is, wrap each apple separately in tissue paper and pack 
in barrels or boxes, but this is rarely done unless the fruit is scarce and 
very fine. D. Z. B. 

TO PRESERVE GRAPES FOR WINTER USE. 

Select perfect bunches, seal the ends of the stems with sealing wax, 
hang them in a dark cellar or in any room in which the air is neither so 
dry as to wither them nor so cold as to freeze them; fasten each bunch 
separately so as not to touch each other. Lida B. 

STRAWBERRIES AU NATURAL. 

Select fresh ripe juicy berries, remove neither hulls nor stems; with 
a tiny brush remove all sand underneath the sepals. Arrange on a 
pretty glass dish or on individual dishes. Serve with a spoonful of pow- 
dered sugar in small paper cup at side of plate. If berries are not fresh 
picked place on ice two hours before serving to freshen them. 

LiLLIE. 
STRAWBERRIES AU NATURAI No. a. 

Choose the largest strawberries, leaving the stems on On each sauce 
plate arrange them around the dish with the strawberries uppermost. 
Then place a little pyramid of powdered sugar in the center of each plate. 
The berries are to be eaten by dipping each one in the sugar. A little pat 
of ice cream may be substituted for the sugar, but in that case the berries 
should be stemmed and hulled. Mrs. J. C M. 

PLUMS. 

(French Style.) 

Select any kind of plums desired. If fresh picked arrange them on 
fancy dish with their own leaves. Serve with small knives. If not fresh 
picked place on ice three hours before serving. Mary Butler, 

CHILLED WATERMELON. 

Select a thoroughly ripe watermelon, place on ice till very cold; now 
wipe dry and cut crosswise at center. Cut out triangular sections (see 
colored illustration ) cut down the remaining sections so as to easily sepa- 
rate with a knife. Serve with rind attached; serve on large round platter 
decorated with fresh grape or apple leaves. John Miller. 



FRESH FRUITS. 4.1? 

GRAPE FRUIT SERVED IN BASKET. 

(Made of the peel.) 

Select medium-sized grape fruit cut in basket shape (see colored illus- 
tration) and with a knife carefully scoop out fruit and all the bitter pulp. 
Return the fruit and sprinkle generously with sugar just before placing it 
on table. Tie to the handle some light blue baby ribbon and some pretty 
geranium leaves and set on fancy plate at each place; a nice first course 
for a luncheon. Leone Hull. 

PINEAPPLE DESSERT. 

Cut the top off of a pineapple and cut away the bottom so that it will 
stand upright on a plate (see colored illustration). Scoop out the pulp 
throwing away the core. Mix the pulp with strawberries and green 
amalaga grapes cutting the berries and grapes into halves. Sweeten and 
return mixture to the pineapple shell and set on ice. Decorate dish with 
leaves from the crown or with grape leaves. Luella. 

ORANQE AND STRAWBERRIES IN BASKET. 

(Made of Peel.) 

Select good-sized oranges, cut off the top, scoop out the center and 
fill with strawberries and some of the orange. If liked pour over a little 
sherry and put on top a spoonful of whipped cream. Delicious. 

John. 
QRAPE5. 

There is no fruit that is so inviting to the eye as large clusters of 
grapes, arranged in a clear glass dish. They can be pulled from the stems 
by the fingers in eating. Nell. 

PEARS. 

Select those that are ripe, pare them and stem them. Cut them in 
halves, laying them on a fruit dish, and sprinkle powdered sugar thickly 
over them. To be eaten with knife and fork. Mary Anderson. 

RAISINS. 

Large clusters of raisins can be arranged upon a fruit dish, and a dish 
of almond-meal set near them. A bunch of the raisins can be placed on 
each plate, and a teaspoonful or two of the almond-meal added. They 
are to be eaten together. Lillian B. 

niXED FRUITS. 

The beauty of any fruit is increased when it is tastefully dished. A 
beautiful method of showing off fruit is to procure a large gilt basket, and 
fill wiih apples, pears, peaches and grapes, and fill in the crevices with 
ferns and geraniums or any green sprays that suggest themselves. The 



418 FRESH FRUITS. 

dish so ornamented should never be too full, and always garnished in 
some way, either with leaves or flowers. When these are not at hand, 
embroidered or lace paper can be bought for the purpose. All fruit 
designed for the table should be carefully examined and wiped with a 
napkin before arranging it on the dish. Mrs. R. Beals. 

MUSKMELONS. 

The large melons may be cut into large pieces and served with a little 
ice on the plate, but small ones are cut in halves, a small piece of ice 
placed in each section and served. They may be made the first course at 
breakfast or luncheon. A. R. G. 

PEACHES AND CREAM. 

Arrange as many peaches as you wish in a handsome dish after pour- 
ing a mixture of sugar and cream over them. Fill the dish with the 
peaches, which must have been pared and quartered and keep pouring 
over the cream and sugar until the dish is full. Then set them on the ice. 

Pruella North. 
A CREAH OF CHERRIES. 

A quart of cherries broken with a spoon but not enough to make the 
pits escape, can be left to stand in a cold place after pouring a cupful of 
sugar over them. Strain off all the juice, sweeten it, and beat one-half 
pint of cream and the white of an egg, adding the juice of the cherries 
very slowly, whipping it till it ceases to foam. The juice must be poured 
in a little at a time, or it will curdle. Frona Williams. 

NUTS AND RAISINS. 

Select the large raisins that come in good-sized bunches and lay a 
handsome doily on a glass dish. Now pile up the raisins on this dish 
and fill in the crevices with shelled nuts of any sort that have been previ- 
ously blanched. Blanching is simply scalding the nuts to remove their 
inner skin. They must be wiped dry afterward before using. This makes 
a pretty dish for the table. Mrs. Laura King. 

MOLDED ORANGES. 

Peel three or four large oranges, being careful not to break the thin 
skin which divides them. Oil a small mold thoroughly. Boil a quarter 
of a pound of loaf sugar in three tablespoonfuls of water till it becomes 
hard and brittle when dropped into cold water, dip the edges of the 
orange sections into this, arrange them in layers round only the sides of 
the mold, and fasten them together with the sugar. When they arc firm, 
turn them on a dish, and fill the center with whipped cream. It takes 
twelve minutes to boil the sugar. J. E. Taber, 



FRESH FRUITS. 419 

PINEAPPLES FOR THE TABLE, 

Unless a pineapple is perfectly ripe it should not be eaten. Pare it, 
removing the eyes. Do not slice it, but after paring cut away the fruit in 
small pieces. Lay them in a glass dish, covered with fine white sugar. 
The core is indigestible, and is not used. Set the pineapple on ice till 
wanted. Flo Brine. 

STRAWBERRIES WITH CREAM. 

Wash them through a colander. Few of the berries brought to mar- 
ket can be used without washing. Drain them well, and when as dry as 
possible, stem them. Sugar and cream should not be placed over them as 
it makes them dark and soft on standing. When brought to table allow 
each guest to use cream and sugar at his own discretion. Keep them 
cool until they are to be served. Mrs. T. Chamberlain. 

APPLE DAINTY. 

Peel eight apples very thin and lay in a dish, in layers, using plenty of 
powdered sugared over each layer and a little lemon juice. Put it on ice 
three hours and it will be found excellent. Mrs. R. Roscoe. 

ICED CURRANTS. 

Procure some of the finest bunches of currants. Beat well the whites 
of two eggs and mix them with one-quarter of a pint of water. Dip each 
cluster of currants separately into the Qg^ and water, drain for two min- 
utes, roll them in finely powdered sugar. Repeat the rolling in sugar and 
lay them on sheets of white paper to dry, when the sugar will become 
crystallized. Alternating white and red currants make a pretty effect. 

Mrs. Lois Eaton. 
RASPBERRIES, ICED. 

Take as many freshly-gathered raspberries as wanted. Whisk the 
white of an egg, and stir in with it two tablespoonfuls of cold water. Dip 
the raspberries quickly one by one in the liquid, drain them, and roll them 
in finely powdered and sifted sugar. Lay them on paper to dry and 
arrange them prettily in a fancy dish. Mrs. W. Sues. 

ORANGE SALAD. 

Peel one-half dozen oranges, free them from the white skin, and cut 
them into slices of about one-quarter of an inch in thickness. Arrange 
them neatly in a compote dish, strew three ounces of finely-powdered 
sugar over them and pour upon them a wine-glassful of California sweet 
wine. If it stands a day before using it is richer. S. E. F. 



420 FRESH FRUITS, 

FIGS AS A DES5ERT. 

Dried figs make a very agreeable dish, but they must be prepared the 
day before and set away on ice. Soak them first, then simmer slowly till 
plump. Drain and pile them in a bon bon dish. Serve whipped cream 
around the dish. Flavor and sweeten the cream with vanilla or sherry. 

P. Thomason. 
ORANGES IN FANCY SHAPES. 

There are many artistic ways of arranging oranges. Cut the peel 
vertically at even distances, beginning at one end, down to the center. 
Now peel down the loosened skin but do not break or cut off but tarn 
points in. The whole resembles a rose. Another pretty way is to peel off 
the entire skin and slice the oranges crosswise; sugar well and place each 
slice as though it was uncut. Ione. 

ICED GRAPES. 

Wash and drain large dry bunches of ripe grapes, two or three vari- 
eties if possible, dip into beaten white of &gg, put in sieve so that they will 
not touch each other, sift powdered sugar over and put in a warm place to 
dry. Cherries may be prepared in the same way. Mrs. N. K. B. 

FRESH RASPBERRY COMPOTE. 

Bruise a quart of sound raspberries thoroughly, put them into a glass 
dish, and sprinkle a pound of powdered sugar over them. Let them lie 
in a cool place for a couple of hours, then pour over them a quart of thin 
claret and a quart of cold water. Send sponge cake or any light cake to 
table with them. Mrs. Lottie Meisman. 

ORANGE COMPOTE. 

Peel the oranges, cut up into sections, pare off all the white skin and 
cut them into slices; place these in a circle in a preserve dish, pour a little 
brandy over and let stand in a cool place in their own juice thirty min- 
utes. Corrine Betts. 

FRESH STRAWBERRY COMPOTE. 

Select fine ripe berries, hull them and arrange in a pyramid in a pre- 
serve dish; press others through a sieve and put the pulp into a vessel 
with plenty of powdered sugar and the juice of an orange; stir well and 
place both this and the strawberries in the ice-box. When ready to serve 
pour the sweetened pulp over the berries. M. Brubaker. 



FRESH FRUITS. 421 

A DESSERT OF PEACHES. 

Select the largest and finest and rub the down off with a clean cloth. 
Lay them on a dish in the form of a diamond and pile them up, row upon 
row, to the height you wish. Cut paper peach leaves and build in unless 
you can obtain the real leaves. Put a circle of the leaves around the base 
of the fruit. Mrs. Sophia Morris. 

APPLES. 

This fruit, which every one loves, can be eaten in any way. Pick nice, 
juicy ones, wipe and polish with a soft napkin and serve in a fancy basket 
decorated with apple leaves. P>uit knives of silver should accompany 
them. Miss Grace Johnson. 

ORANQES, SLICED. 

Peel one-half dozen oranges and cut them in slices crosswise, picking 
out the seeds. Then sprinkle generously with pulverized sugar and set in 
a cool place. The colder any raw fruit can be made the better the flavor. 

W. T. M. 
BANANAS. 

Strip off the outer skin and cut the fruit in slices. Pour cream over 
and serve. P. E. F. 

WATERMELON AU NATURAL. 

Procure the watermelon a day or so before they are to be used and 
place in a cold cellar or put on ice. They can be sliced across or length- 
wise but need no dressing of any sort. Amy. 

STUFFED DATES. 

Select large dates, remove the seeds and refill with blanched almonds 
or pecan nuts. Excellent for a final course to luncheon. Greta M. 

STUFFED PRUNES. 

Select very targe prunes, soak a short time so they will swell and 
become plump, remove the pit and stuff with other prunes as full as they 
can be stuffed. Sift over powdered sugar and pile on bonbon dish. Very 
fine. Theresa M. 

CRYSTALLIZED ORANQES AND LEMONS. 

Boil together for one-half hour one cupful of granulated sugar and 
one of water. Dip the point of a skewer or darning needle in the syrup 
after it has been boiling the given time and then in water. If the thread 
formed breaks off brittle the syrup is done. Pare some oranges, divide 
them into eighths and wipe free of moisture. Pour part of the hot syrup 

27 



422 FRESH FRUITS. 

into a cup, which keep in boiling water. Take the pieces of orange on 
the point of a large needle or skewer and dip them in the syrup. Place 
them on a dish that has been buttered lightly. Care must be taken not to 
stir the syrup as that spoils it. Mary B. Burns. 

FRUIT QLACE. 

Prepare syrup as above and take any prepared fruits desired (grapes, 
pineapple, cherries, etc.) on point of a darning needle; dip them in the 
syrup; when cold they are ready for use. 

Note. — Apples, it is said, are now considered to contain far more 
brain food than any other fruit or vegetable, and to be much more nutri- 
tious than potatoes, which enter so largely into the component parts of 
every meal. M. B. B. 

CHESTNUTS CRYSTALLIZED WITH WHITE SUGAR. 

Make syrup as above. Boil the requisite quantity of chestnuts until 
soft, and peel them, taking care not to break them. Take them on the 
point of a skewer, one at a time; dip them first into the syrup and then, 
quickly, into cold water. Slip them off the skewer into a wire sieve and 
dry them in a warm place. G. S. T 

STUFFED DATES— No. a. 

Remove seeds. Replace with blanched almond. Roll in coarse 
sugar. H. F. L. 

CHESTNUTS CRYSTALLIZED WITH CARAMEL. 

Prepare as above only instead of putting the chestnuts on a sieve to 
dry have ready a broad flat basin, put some brown sugar or caramel in it; 
dip the chestnuts into it, leaving them to drain. When they are cold 
arrange them tastefully on a dish. S. T, O.

WITH the revolution in various 
departments of household eco- 
nomics and an awakening as to what 
substances are injurious and what harm- 
less, has come a cry against the use of 
Lard in cooking. For years, physicians 
have tried to convince the public that 
lard was indigestible; but its use has gone on; not entirely because the peo- 
ple ha.ve wanted to use it, but because the substitutes which have been 
tried, have proved a failure. Indeed, some have been quite as hurtful as 
the article which it was intended to displace, and so unpleasant in taste as 
to force people to turn back again to lard. But all these experiments have 
led to further search and at last it looks as if a substitute had been found 
which meets the requirements. Besides the merit of being a pure vegeta- 
ble fat, it is pleasant to the taste and easy of digestion. Ko-nut is a pure, 
sterilized oil, made from fresh sweet cocoanut. It will seem at first, to those 
using it, a trifle more expensive than lard, but it is, after all, quite as eco- 
nomical, for not more than two-thirds as much is required to make a given 
recipe, as of butter or lard. For frying, shortening, and cooking, it 
replaces butter, is not easily scorched, neither is much absorbed in the 
cooking. It is now put up in pails similar to lard and has excellent keep- 
ing qualities as well as high shortening powers. Being comparatively 
new, it may not as yet be found at all grocers. Ask your grocer to get it 
for you. 

Miss Myrtle Robinson, a demonstrator in the new cooking school 
kindly furnishes us many recipes in the following pages, which, according 
to my opinion, are unsurpassed. I quote here an extract from the Chi- 
cago Times-Herald: 

"An event of uncommon interest occurred at Evanston this week in 
the series of cooking lessons and lectures given by Miss Myrtle E. Robin- 
son, of Boston, a graduate of the New Era Cooking School, of Worcester. 
Mass. Miss Robinson is tall, quiet and engaging in personality. She 
spoke with grace and easy flow of pure English, which, with the thorough 
mastery of her subject, gave a charm that was irresistible, while at the 
time she created new editions of pies, sandwiches, salads, jellies, and 
divers dainties with such deft, precise and faultless motions as completely 
to fascinate the eye and ear, holding all listeners as by a charmed spell. 
The knowledge given of properties and building power of different

articles of common food was of great value to the wives and mothers, 
because it was so practical and will be so helpful in selecting a diet that 
will fit the body of each member of the family for the work of brain, 
nerve and muscle. The directions for making each dish, with minute 
details of kind, quality and strength of ingredients, the best way to pre- 
pare them, the exact way to measure quantities, the length of time for 
cooking and all the small points were carefully given, to the delight of our 
hearts, and all the while the creation advanced and finally appeared in its 
(one is tempted to say) poetic beauty, for indeed the finished product was 
'a thing of beauty,' and 'the proof of the pudding' was not lacking in the 
eating. The attendance increased each day and those coming the last 
day regretted their absence previous days."

THE NUTRITIVE value of cereals when cooked properly makes them 
nearly a perfect food. 

First in the list, from a nutritive point, comes wheat. Oats possess 
more nitrogenous matter than any other grain, and that gives strength to 
the system. Oats are also flesh-formers. Corn, rye, rice and barley are 
cereals widely adopted as breakfast foods. 

There is a large number of these foods sold in packages, with direc- 
tions as to the length of time they should be cooked. But in nearly every 
case they need longer boiling, and if the time for cooking them were 
extended, they would be much more digestible. 

GRAPE NUTS. 

For nervous people and brain workers no cereal is better for break- 
fast than Grape Nuts. It can be obtained of any grocer. Directions for 
use are on each package. Mrs. Gregory. 

CORN FRITTERS. 

Boil a dozen ears of corn, or more than are needed for dinner, and 
while warm scrape them with the corn cutter, and put the corn in the 
refrigerator until morning. To two coffee-cupfuls of corn add two or 
three well-beaten eggs, three tablespoonfuls of cream or new milk and a 
small teacupful of flour, with a little salt. Drop in spoonfuls into hot fat 
and fry a light brown. Or else cook them on the griddle iron like any 
other cakes. Mrs. Lucy Blanchard. 

CORN FRITTERS— No. 2. 

Six grated ears of corn or one can of corn strained through a colandei

and drain on paper. Serve hot J. E. A.

nutmeg. Turn them over the fire several times, then pile them on a hot 
dish, cover them with grated bread-crumbs and brown them in a quick 
oven. Serve hot. Mrs. Lydia Fay. 

PATTIES OF RICE. 

In a saucepan put one-quarter of a pound of rice that has been washed 
carefully through three or four waters, cover it with white stock and boil 
slowly till the rice has absorbed all the liquid. Add a little milk to give 
the rice a white appearance. Grate Parmesan cheese and add it to taste, 
and when the rice begins to be jellied, turn it into a dish, making it two 
inches thick. Cut the patties out with a round biscuit cutter.

ASANARTICLE

THE CRAVINGS of the human palate are changing very essentially. 
Once, nuts were regarded as a luxury, a dainty only to be used 
between meals, or something for the children on extra occasions; but 
to-day they are looked upon as an assistant to the forces of nature in 
imparting nutriment. They produce heat and form flesh. They take the 
place of meat and are subject to no adulterations. They yield bounteously 
under cultivation and have become one of the most important articles of 
commerce. 

By some scientists they are regarded as superior to meat and the fact 
that they can be used in so many forms in the culinary department recom- 
mends them to the housewife who is always ready to extend her repertoire 
of choice foods. 

The chestnut was a prominent article of food among the ancients, 
and is to-day made into bread in many countries. The peasantry of the 
south of France make a daily dish of boiled chestnuts and milk and 
thrive upon it. 

Flour made from the peanut is found to be more nutritious than that 
ground from any of the cereals; butter made from it (peanut butter) is 
also becoming a staple article of commerce and is used by vegetarians 
instead of butter made from cow's milk. 

It is certain that a gain in flesh is observed where nuts compose the 
main article of diet. It is said by some that nuts are heavy and clog the 
system. The reason for this complaint is that they are usually eaten after 
a meal that is already too heavy. Another reason, some people cannot 
thoroughly masticate them. This brings into prominence their value when 
they are ground and cooked, and the fact that they afford a nearly per- 
fect substitute for animal foods. There are several delicious products

The recipes for making the above dishes and hundreds of others are contained within 

this book. 



NUTS AS AN ARTICLE OF DIET. 445 

formed from nuts which can be procured at all the groceries. We append 
a few of the best ones with recipes for their preparation. 

NUT BUTTER. 

This butter is a thoroughly sterilized product of edible nut meats, a 
more than perfect substitute for butter, as it makes blood as well as fat. 
Makes a perfect emulsion with water. It is recognized as a great delicacy 
wherever used. Keeps perfectly. Put up in tins of different sizes. 

Place the desired quantity of nut butter in a bowl, add a few drops of 
water and beat with a fork until smooth. For nut cream, prepare the 
same as above, add a little more water until of the consistency desired. 
For nut milk add four or five parts of water to one of nut butter. 

W. T. M. 
NUT LOAF. 

Three cupfuls of stale bread-crumbs, or^e and one-half cupfuls of 
chopped hickory nuts, one and one-half cupfuls of seeded raisins, one-half 
teaspoonful of salt. Mix, adding sufficient hot water to moisten. Cover 
and let stand ten minutes. Add one cupful more of hot water and turn 
into buttered pan. Bake one and one quarter hour in moderate oven and 
serve cold. A. A. C. 

NUT LOAF— No. 2. 

The most delightful combinations may be made with left-over foods 
combined with bread-crumbs, soups, nut preparations, with or without 
tomato or browned flour. The seasoning may be varied with onion, mint, 
thyme, sage, savory, marjoram, caraway, celery seed or leaves or stalks. 
In using protose, take equal quantities of that and very dry but not too fine 
bread-crumbs (if they are moist, twice the quantity will be required), 
chopped onion, and a trifle of mint (not over one-eighth of a teaspoonful 
to a good-sized loaf), with a little strained tomato, and water and salt. 
The mixture should be quite dry, after standing a few minutes for the 
crumbs (if dry) to become moistened. It should not seem watery when 
pressed together with the hand, but should be just moist enough to hold 
together; if too moist, the loaf will be solid and soggy when baked; or if 
not baked long enough it will be too soft to slice nicely. When prepared, 
press the mixture into an oiled, brick-shaped tin and bake in a moderate 
oven about one hour, or until it feels rather firm when pressed with the 
fingers. Loosen the sides, turn out on a board, and slice carefully with a 
thin, sharp knife. Serve with brown gravy or tomato sauce. E. J. S.

NUT SOUP. 

Break into sm'^ll pieces one cupful of hickory and almond nuts of 
equal amounts. S amer in two pints of water seasoned with one-half 
teaspoonful of salt, a slice of onion and two stalks of celery. When ten- 
der add one cupful )f rich milk or cream. This soup may be strained or 

not, as desired. H. O. C. 

NUT SOUP— No. 2. 

Simmer a pint of Lima beans gently in just sufficient water to cook 
and not burn, until they have fallen to pieces. Add more boiling water 
as needed. When done, rub the beans through a colander. Add nut 
soup stock to make of the proper consistency and salt to season. Reheat 
and serve. White beans may be used in place of Lima beans, but they 
require longer cooking. A heaping tablespoonful of sago, previously 
soaked in cold water, may be added to the soup when it is reheated, if 
liked, and the whole cooked until the sago is transparent. F. M. P. 

NUT CROQUETTES. 

Steam one-half cupful of well-washed rice in one cupful of water with 
one-fourth teaspoonful of salt for one hour or until tender. Add to this 
an equal bulk of dry simmered protose, one &gg and salt to taste; shape, 
roll in fine bread-crumbs; bake twenty minutes in a moderate oven. If 
liked one tablespoonful of chopped parsley or celery may be added before 
shaping. Protose as it comes from the can chopped may be used if pre- 
ferred. H. F. L. 

ALHOND PUDDING. 

Soak three tablespoonfuls of finely-grated bread-crumbs in milk. 

Add one-quarter of a pound of blanched and pounded almonds, a piece of 

butter the size of an &gg melted in a pint of new milk, sugar to taste, a 

teaspoonful of grated lemon-rind, a little nutmeg and three eggs well 

beaten. A glass of wine may be added if approved of. Place in a pudding 

dish lined with paste, and bake in a moderate oven. 

Mrs. Sarah Bullard. 
PEANUT BEANS. 

A dish closely resembling baked beans is afforded by taking the Vir- 
gina shelled raw peanuts. Pour boiling water over them and boil for five 
minutes. When cool slip the brown skins off, with the fingers. Put in the 
bean pot about one and one-half teaspoonfuls of salt to each pound of 
nuts and a large quantity of boiling water. Let them boil fast for one 
hour or so, then place them in a slow oven where they will gently simmer 



NUTS AS AN ARTICLE OF DIET 447 

for from eight to fourteen hours. If the water evaporates, add boih'ng 

water and let it settle through them without stirring them. They should 

be slightly juicy when done. Mrs. Adelaide Haigh. 

Salted nuts are served with dinner, and are eaten at any time during 

the meal. 

PROTOSE ROAST WITH BROWN GRAVY. 

Put alternate layers of sliced protose and finely sliced onion, with salt, 
in a small tin or dripper. Cover with water and bake slowly for two or 
three hours, adding water as required. When ready to serve, remove the 
protose from the tin, add more water to that left in the tin, if necessary, 
and thicken with a mixture of brown and white flour stirred up with 
water. This may be served with peeled baked potatoes, or the potatoes 
may be baked with the protose. I. T. O. 

WALNUTS. 

Put large, sound nuts into an earthen pan, and pour over them as 
much cold water slightly salted as will cover them. Leave them until the 
next day and rub them dry before using them. They make a good des- 
sert. E. F. I. 

PRESSED PROTOSE LOAF. 

Break up protose slightly with a fork, add salt, a very little sage, and, 
if necessary, a little water to make the protose hold together. Pack it 
into an oiled tin, put a weight on it, press firmly, and let it stand in a cool 
place several hours. When ready to serve, run a knife blade around 
from the edge of the tin, turn the contents out carefully, slice with a thin, 
sharp knife, and serve with onion points, cranberry sauce, jelly, or celery. 
A little Nuttolene may be used with the protose. Minced yolks of hard- 
boiled eggs are an improvement in the loaf. Seasoning with celery salt 
and a little lemon juice instead of the sage, salt and water makes another 
variety. Minced onion with or instead of the sage gives a different dish. 
This may be broiled before serving if desired and served with sour-apple 

sauce. C. A. T. 

SOUR SALAD DRESSING. 

Rub two slightly rounded tablespoonfuls of peanut or almond butter 
smooth with two-thirds of a cupful of water (the half-pint cupful sold in 
stores), according to directions for preparing the nut butter for bread Let 
this cream boil up for a moment over the fire. Remove from the stove, 
add one-half teaspoonful of salt and two tablespoonfuls of lemon-juice. 
Cool, and it is ready for use. If too thick, it may be thinned with a little 
lemon juice or water. More salt and lemon juice may be added if desired. 



448 NUTS AS AN ARTICLE OF DIET. 

By using a scant cupful of strained stewed tomato in place of the water in 
the above, with the almond butter, we have a palatable and very pretty 
dressing. A. P V 

NUT BUTTER SANDWICHES. 

Cut a loaf of bread in two in the center, spread the cut surface of each 
half with nut butter, and sprinkle with salt if desired. Cut off a thin slice 
from each half with a sharp knife, and lay the two spread surfaces 
together. Continue to spread and cut the slices until you have the 
required number of sandwiches. Thin slices of protose, or a lettuce leaf 
with salad dressing, or both, may be laid between the slices. U. P. A. 

SALTED ALMONDS. 

Blanch the almonds by putting the meats in boiling water, let stand a 
few moments. Remove the hulls and dry the nuts. Put about a teaspoon- 
ful of butter in a long flat tin, and when it melts put in the nuts. Sprinkle a 
little salt over them, and let them brown, stirring often. Be careful not to 
let them brown too much. Take them off, put on a paper to absorb the 
fat and sprinkle well with salt. W. F. A. 

SALTED PEANUTS. 

The peanuts must be shelled and blanched. Put them in a pan with a 
little butter and fry them quickly. Remove them to a colander and 
sprinkle them with fine salt, shaking them constantly. They may be 
served in little trays at each plate. E. J. A. 

SALTED PISTACHIO NUTS. 

Pistachio nuts salted are so expensive an item, but such a picturesque 
addition to the table that one should learn how to prepare them at home 
Take a cupful of the shelled nuts, blanch them and after removing the 
skins stir in some salt and a little sweet oil — perhaps a tablespoonful. Let 
the nuts stand for one-half hour, then put them in an oven to become 
crisp, but not too brown. They should be served in a tinted china dish 
that harmonizes with the color of the nuts, or in a bonbon basket of fili- 
gree silver. A few chopped pistachios scattered thickly over a charlotte 
russe add to the appearance and flavor of the dessert. A. C. F. 

PEANUT POUND CAKE. 

Three large or four small eggs, a scant cupful of granulated sugar, 
one tablespoonful of lemon juice, one tablespoonful of ice water, one cup 
of sifted nut meal, one-half cupful of sliced citron, if desired, one-half to 



NUTS AS AN ARTICLE OF DIET. 449 

two-thirds of a cupful of pastry flour, sifted once before measuring; salt. 
Have the ingredients as nearly ice-cold as possible. Sift the sugar; sift 
the flour twice and leave it in the sifter. Beat the yolks of three eggs, 
adding sugar gradually. When stiff add part of the water and more 
sugar. Beat, add more water, sugar, and one-half the lemon juice until 
all the sugar is in. Stir into this mixture one-half the nut meal, a good 
pinch of salt and the citron. Beat the whites of the eggs to a moderately 
stiff froth, with a pinch of salt. Add the remainder of the lemon juice, 
and beat until dry and feathery. Slide the beaten whites on the yolk 
mixture, sprinkle part of the nut meal over them, sift on a little flour and 
chop in lightly. Add more meal and flour; chop; continue until the flour 
is all in. Take care not to mix too much. Put into a pan at once and 
bake slowly in an oven that bakes well from the bottom. Handle care- 
fully when taking from the oven. If a gasoline oven is used, the fire may 
be turned off and the cake allowed to cool in the oven. M. E. P. 

HARD SAUCE OF NUTS. 

Rub together equal quantities of nut butter and sugar with a little 
salt and add water to make it smooth. A little more water makes a 
cream sauce. M. B. C. 

NUT SAUCE FOR VEGETABLES. 

Cream two large spoonfuls of Brazil nuts with warm water, then stir 
in gradually nearly a pint of hot water. Mix in one-half cupful of tomato 
that has been stewed and strained. Boil it up once and thicken with a 
tablespoonful of flour and cook till done — about six minutes. 

E. G. Don. 
PROTOSE CHOPS. 

Dip thin slices of protose (which can be procured at the grocer's), with 
any flavor you prefer, into beaten &gg and bread-crumbs and broil. Serve 
with a brown or tomato sauce. Garnish with parsley. A. C. F. 

HAZEL NUT CAKES. 

Mince very finely two ounces of hazel nuts and one-half ounce of 
sweet almonds. Add three ounces of pounded and sifted sugar, the white 
of an ^gg, beaten to a firm froth, and as much flour as will bind them 
together. Roll the paste out till it is one-quarter of an inch thick, stamp 
it out in small round cakes, place these on well-buttered tins, and bake in 
a slow oven twenty minutes. Mrs. R. Swarts. 



450 NUTS AS AN ARTICLE OP DIET, 

HAZEL NUT TARTS. 

One scant cupful of powdered sugar, yolks of six eggs, well beaten, 
one pound of hazel nuts. The nuts should be ground and one-third of 
them kept for filling. Filberts can be used if preferred. Grind bread 
enough to make one and one-quarter cupfuls and keep one-third of that 
for filling. First mix sugar and yolks of eggs, then add one tablespoonful 
of rum, then the nuts, bread, and whites of eggs. Bake in two layers. 

Filling. — One cupful of milk, one-half cupful of sugar, a piece of but- 
ter the size of an egg; let them come to a boil. Set aside and add the 
remaining nuts, bread, and a tablespoonful of rum. 

Frosting. — One and one-third cupfuls of confectioner's sugar, with 
cream added to make it stiff. Flavor with almond or vanilla extract. 

Mrs. M. Sontag. 

NUT SANDWICHES. 

Butter very thin slices of Boston brown bread and lay finely chopped 
almonds between the sliceSo Salt them very lightly — a mere dash of salt 
should be used. G. D. 

PEANUT SANDWICHES. 

Shell and remove the skins from one cupful of freshly-roasted pea> 
nuts; chop very fine, mix with one tablespoonful of mayonnaise dressing. 
Spread with butter and cut thin slices of white bread, remove crusts and 
spread the peanut dressing between the slices. Anna Hill, 

NUT CORN PUDDING. 

Put thin slices of protose into a three-quart basin in layers, with six 
tablespoonfuls of finely sliced celery, salt, and a slight dredging of flour 
until one-half or two-thirds full. Cover well with water and bake from 
one-half hour to one hour. Then spread over it the following corn puddingy 
sprinkle lightly with fine crumbs and bake until a delicate brown over the 
top. Mrs, J. M. C. 

CORN PUDDING. 

Two cans of sweet corn rubbed through a colander, three well-beaten 
eggs, one cupful of milk; salt to taste. Mrs. J. M. C 

NUT BREAD. 

Make brown or white bread the usual way and just before forming 
into loaves drop in a generous handful of pecan nuts in one loaf. This 
makes a change and is greatly enjoyed by the children. Mary.

BROMOSE. 

A combination of carefully blanched, thoroughly cooked, and sterilized 
nut meats with predigested cereals, put up in jars, and in tablets resem- 
bling caramels. Delicate as a confection and makes fat and blood with 
extraordinary rapidity. Ready to eat at once. E. F. C. 

FRUIT COCOA. 

A delicious food beverage. It contains no chocolate, cocoa, tea, 

coffee, glucose, sugar, cream, or milk, but is a pure product of tropical 

fruits and nuts. It can be used in any way in which cocoa or chocolate h 

employed. C. A. L. 

NUT AMBROSIA. 

A preparation similar to malted nuts in composition but treated in 

such a manner as to produce a crisp, crusty mass with a vich nutty flavor, 

Veritably the daintiest and most delicious food product ever discovered 

It melts in the mouth, comforts the stomach, and makes fat and blood with 

great rapidity. One-half pound to a pound per day h a not uncommon 

gain in weight on using. Ambrosia dissolves in hot or cold water. 

P. E. F. 
PROTOSE. 

Vegetable meat. It resembles animal food in appearance and com- 
position, but is far more nourishing. D. B. M. 

NUT SOUP STOCK. 

This consists of the concentrated, soluble portions of choice nuts and 

is a perfect substitute for meat stocks. Can be used by itself or with 

vegetable products. It may be used just as extract of beef is.* Dissolve 

in hot or cold water. Add the water sloWly at first, one part stock to ten 

of water. M. A. B. 

SALTED ALMONDS. 

Warm an ounce of butter in a baking pan and when it is quite hot 

throw in a pound of blanched and dried almonds, sprinkle with salt and 

put in a hot oven; when they begin to assume a fine delicate brown and 

the salt adheres pour them on a sieve and leave till cold. Serve cold on 

small dish. Walnuts, pecan nuts, peanuts, and others can be prepared 

in the same way. W. T. M.

mixture through a sieve. Beat three eggs until light and stir into that 
which has been strained. Place in a double boiler and cook eight min- 
utes, stirring constantly. It should by this time be smooth and thick, if 
the water in the outer boiler has been boiling rapidly. When cold, butter 
the hands and mold into balls. Dip into a beaten egg, then into bread- 
crumbs; fry one and one-half minutes. Serve hot. M. W. T.

olive oil, salt and a pinch of sugar. Hold a small sieve over the salad, 
grate over the chestnuts the yolk of the ^gg and over all lay the white of 
the egg cut In rings. Emma Brooks. 




THEIR IMPORTANCE. 

IT MAY seem superfluous to give directions about the cooking of vege- 
tables, for to many housewives it is the simplest matter in the world 
to wash and cook them in scores of appetizing ways. Yet, now that vege- 
tables are beginning to form the main diet of hundreds of thinking men 
and women, it is not out of place to learn that more is involved in their 
cooking than sometimes seems. Even the potato, with which all are 
familiar, when brought to the table in a sticky, soggy condition, will neither 
gladden the eye, tempt the appetite, nor furnish the nourishment it other- 
wise would. 

SUGGESTIONS ON THE COOKING OF VEGETABLES. 

The greatest care should be taken in preparing and boiling vege- 
tables. If taken from the garden, they ought to be gathered in the morn- 
ing while still wet with the dew and if from the market they should be 
put in cold water until crisp, before cooking. Never boil them longer 
than until just done. Put them on in an abundance of fresh water, slightly 
salted, that is just beginning to boil. Water that has boiled for some time 
is flat. Care should be taken that the water does not cease to boil until the 
vegetables are done; drain immediately after. 

For onions, cabbage, turnips, etc., it is best to change the water, espe- 
cially when used during the winter, since the flavor, then, is much stronger. 
Dried peas, beans and lentils should be previously soaked and put on to 
boil with cold water. Boil spinach and kale in an abundance of water in 
an uncovered pot, to retain the color. 

Never thicken vegetables of any kind by adding flour mixed with cold 
water. Always put butter in a saucepan, to this add the flour, mix well, 
then add to the vegetables. This improves not only the looks, but also 

29 453

the taste to such an extent that the little extra work will not be taken 
into consideration by those who believe in doing things right. 

The best water to use for the cooking of vegetables is pure well water. 
In cities where spring water cannot be procured, lake water will answer 
but should first be filtered to take out the sediment. 

TIME FOR COOKING VEGETABLES. 

Although no exact time can be given for cooking the various vege- 
tables, as much depends upon the age and freshness, yet the following 
table will help, to some extent, the inexperienced cook. My advice is to 
test with a fork, or taste, and thus decide: 

Potatoes, boiled, twenty-five minutes Tomatoes, fresh, one-half hour. 

Potatoes, baked, forty-five minutes. Tomatoes, canned, one-quarter hour. 

Sweet Potatoes, boiled, forty-five minutes. Cabbage, three-fourths of an hour to an 

Sweet Potatoes, baked, sixty minutes. hour. 

Squash, boiled, twenty-five minutes. Cauliflower, one hour. 

Squash, baked, one hour. Dandelions, two hours. 

Green peas, boiled, twenty to forty min- Beet Greens, one hour. 

utes. Onions, one and one-quarter hours. 

Shelled beans, boiled, sixty minutes, Beets, two hours. 

String beans, boiled, one hour. Turnips, white, forty-five minutes. 

Green corn, boiled quickly, twenty min- Turnips, yellow, one and one-half hours. 

utes. Parsnips, one and one-half hours. 

Asparagus, fifteen to thirty minutes. Carrots, one hour. 
Spinach, one hour. 

Nearly all these vegetables are eaten dressed with salt, pepper and 
butter, but sometimes a small piece of salt pork is boiled with them, and 
seasons them nicely, 

HASHED BROWN POTATOES. 

Chop two boiled potatoes fine; take a large saucepan (an omelet pan 

is best); put in two tablespoonfuls of butter; when hot turn in potatoes, 

dust with salt and pepper and with limber knife pat down into a smooth 

sheet; stand pan over a moderate fire and cook slowly for ten minutes; 

now begin at one end of pan and roll over and pat each roll down until 

you get to opposite side of pan and potatoes are in the shape of omelet, 

put your serving dish over pan and turn up-side down; then they are 

ready to serve. Della Yeomans. 

HOLLANDAISE POTATOES. 

The potatoes should be pared, washed and cut into one shape before 
cooking. This can be done with an apple corer, a potato scoop or they 



VBGETABLES 455 

L-an be cut into cubes. Boil twenty minutes in slightly salted water, tak- 
ing care that they do not break, then drain and let cool a little. Now 
prepare a golden sauce as follows: Boil one-half cupful of milk or water 
with one-half dozen pepper corns and one-half teaspoonful of salt. When 
flavored, strain it into another saucepan and add one-half cupful of butter 
and the yolks of three eggs beat with a fork, over the fire, until it thickens 
like cream. Then squeeze in the juice of one-half of a lemon or a 
tablespoonful of vinegar. Pour over the potatoes and garnish with sprigs 
of parsley. Leone. 

STUFFED POTATOES. 

Select potatoes of even size. Cut a thin slice from one end, that they 
may stand firm and put in the oven to bake. When well done remove 
from the oven and with sharp scissors cut a lid from the upper end, and 
scoop out the potato into a hot bowl with a teaspoon, keeping the skin 
whole. Beat the potato in the bowl with a little cream, a teaspoonful of 
butter, a speck of salt and pepper. Then fill the skins with the mixture, 
heaping it high on top. Set the potatoes carefully on end and return to 
oven for ten minutes to heat. Serve on a platter with sprigs of parsley 
and a few tiny specks of butter. Lida M. 

TO BOIL NEW POTATOES. 

Do not pare them but scrape the skins off with a dull knife, washing 
them nicely after. Put into boiling water and boil about fifteen minutes. 
Drain them and add a cupful of milk. Now melt a little butter, thicken 
with flour, and pour over them, keeping on the fire just ,long enough to 
heat to boiling point. Serve hot. Mrs. J. Samuels, 

LYONNAISE POTATOES. 

Take six cold boiled potatoes, place them in a frying-pan with a piece 
of butter the size of an English walnut and an onion chopped up raw. 
Season with a pinch each of salt and pepper. Cook for ten minutes, stir- 
ring until well browned. Chop a little parsley and sprinkle over. 

Mrs. Katie Upton. 

POTATO CAKES. 

Grate raw potatoes and add a little salt, a piece of butter and an ^gg. 
Beat all well together, dredge with flour. Drop them into good drippings 
and fry a light brown. Cold mashed potatoes can be made in the same 
manner but are not as nice Mrs S. Stevenson.

POTATO CROQUETTES. 

Peel, boil and mash a quart of potatoes, mixing with them tlie yolks 
of four eggs, two ounces of milk; set on the fire, stir for two minutes,

POTATO SOUFFLE. 

Select for baking, potatoes as near of a size as possible; cut off each 
end; when baked scoop out the inside with a spoon, being careful not to 
break the skins. Add to the potato, butter, salt, and sufificient hot milk to 
make quite soft; beat till very light and smooth; fill the skins with this 
and place on end in a buttered pan on the oven grate till browned on top. 
The potatoes will puff up considerably if sufficiently beaten. Nice for 
breakfast or tea. Mrs. J. C. Janewav. 

POTATO TORTILLA. 

Four eggs, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, three large potatoes, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter or oil. Cut cold potatoes, previously cooked, 
into slices, and sprinkle with the parsley. Put the butter or oil into a 
saute pan, and when boiling, fry the potatoes a light brown. Beat four 
eggs; season with pepper and salt and pour into the potatoes; shake the 
pan constantly to prevent sticking. When one side is brown, turn the 
tortilla with a plate and brown the other. Serve at once. 

Mrs. Lucy Mead. 
MASHED POTATOES. 

Cook the potatoes in salted water until thoroughly done, then drain. 
Set on the back of the stove, mash and beat with a wooden spoon until 
the lumps are all gone; then add enough milk (a little at a time) to make 
tiiem nice and creamy, butter the size of an ^^%, more salt. Put in the

Mrs. Mary A. Winter. 
SARATOGA CHIPS. 

Peel the potatoes carefully, cut into very thin slices and keep in cold 

water over night; in the morning drain off the water and rub the potatoes 

between napkins until thoroughly dry, then throw a handful at a time 

into a kettle or pan of very hot lard, stirring so that they may not adhere 

to the kettle or to each other. As soon as they become light brown and 

crisp remove quickly with a skimmer and sprinkle with salt as they are 

taken up. Mrs. O. Atwater. 

POTATO BALLS. 

Take four cold boiled potatoes, rub through a wire sieve, put into a 
stev;-pan with one-half ounce of butter and a dessert-spoonful of milk; 
beat over the fire till smooth. Add pepper and salt, the yolk of an egg

earthen or granite dish, in which they can be sent to the table if desired 
When done they must be light brown and crisp on the outside and be 
easily pierced with a fork. Serve hot. 

Note. — When perfectly done all baked potatoes should be pierced 
with a fork two or three times several minutes before taking them out of 
the oven to favor the escape of steam, which makes them drier and 
improves the taste. J. D. E. 

FRENCH FRIED POTATOES. 

Peel the potatoes, slice them lengthwise in slices one-quarter inch 

thick, drop them in cold water for one hour, then take them out and dry

the juice of a lemon through a hair sieve into the sauce and pour one-half 
into a sauce-boat, the rest over the cauliflower. Mrs. Serah Paulding. 

CAULIFLOWER SERVED WITH MELTED BUTTER, 

Take off all the green leaves, cut the flower close at the bottom, from 
the stalk; if large, divide into four quarters. Put into cold water, let it 
lie an hour, then put into boiling milk and water, or water only — milk 
makes it whiter — skim while boiling. When the stalks are tender take it 
up at once or it loses its crispness. Lay it on a cloth or colander to drain 
and serve with melted butter. Mrs. F. Thorne. 

CAULIFLOWER RELISH. 

Take a fine white head of cauliflower and chop it fine. Put a piece of 
butter as large as a butternut into a shallow pan; add three or four table- 
spoonfuls of strong vinegar. Stew the cauliflower, covered over with a 
flat tin, for twenty minutes, or until it is perfectly tender. Serve on slices 
of toasted bread, or on a platter with bits of toast cut into triangles, and 
well browned, then laid in points around the dish. This is a nice luncheon 
or supper dish. Mrs. Lily Baker. 

BROCCOLI. 

Trim off all leaves that are not liked, and place the broccoli in a pan 
of salted water to kill any insects, that may have taken shelter under the 
stalks. Wash them well and put them into an uncovered saucepan of 
boiling water with a large tablespoonful of salt to every one-half gallon 
of water. Keep them boiling till done. Drain them directly or they will 
lose color and become sodden. Mrs. Sarah Winters.

5TUFFED CABBAGE HEAD. 

(German style.) 

Separate the leaves of two cabbages carefully, boil until about one- 
half done in salt water, drain well, then take a clean, large napkin, lay it 
into a colander, over this place the largest leaves, one next to the other, 
overlapping some and meeting at the bottom, with the bottom of the leaf 
down. During the time the cabbage is boiling, prepare the forcemeat, 
regulate the quantity of meat according to the size of the cabbage you 
wish to make. Chop the small leaves of the cabbage very fine, add to 
the chopped meat bread-crumbs, three eggs, a liberal piece of butter and 
cream; mix this thoroughly and season with pepper, salt, and allspice; 
spread a thick layer of this over the leaves in the colander, cover with 
another layer of boiled cabbage leaves, continue this until it is all used 
up. Now take the two opposite corners of the napkin, also the two others, 
and secure firmly with a string, allowing plenty of room for swelling, but 
at the same time retaining the shape as much as possible. Boil it in 
plenty of water to cover well for two or three hours. Serve the cabbage 
whole, and garnish with parsley, when served hot; when served cold, slice 
it. Excellent either way. F. W, 

CABBAGE WITH CREAM DRESSING. 

Remove the outside leaves of the cabbage heads and quarter them;

brown on the under side. Turn out up-side down so the brown part will 
be on top, and serve hot. Amanda Briggs. 

SAUERKRAUT. 

Sauerkraut makes a delightful change from the regular way of serv- 
ing cabbage. Our German forefathers thought there was nothing like it. 
It can be easiest made in the fall when cabbages are plentiful. It will 
retain its flavor all during the winter. It is usually made in a barrel. Take 
firm cabbages, remove the outer leaves and slice into shreds, either by hand 
or with a machine made for the purpose. In the bottom of the barrel, put 
a layer of coarse salt, then a layer of cabbage and salt again until the 
desired amount is packed. With each layer of cabbage, press down with 
a heavy pestle until the juice floats on the surface, then a fresh layer can 
be added. Some flavor sauerkraut with a few grains of coriander, juniper 
berries, etc.; others do not. When the sauerkraut is made, place in a dry 
cellar, cover with a cloth; on top of the sauerkraut a plank should be 
placed and on this a heavy weight. At the end of a few days it will begin 
to ferment, then draw off the liquor and replace fresh. Repeat this each 
day until the liquor becomes clear, then remove cloth, wash, cover again 
and put the weights back. Let stand a month and it will be ready for use. 
Sauerkraut can be boiled with spare-ribs, ham, or sausage, or it can be 
fried. If the sauerkraut is too sour, pour clear water over it and press it 
out again, then put it in a granite kettle, with enough water to partially 
cover it, and cook. H. O. C. 

HOT SLAW. 

Slice a head of cabbage fine, put it in a stew-pan with a little water, 
and scald well; sprinkle salt and pepper over it; then take two-thirds of a 
teacupful of vinegar, one-third of a teacupful of water, one ^^%, one-half 
teaspoonful of flour, a piece of butter, all well mixed together; pour it 
over the cabbage, and let it come to a boil, when it is ready for the table. 

Harriet A. Haight. 

RED CABBAGE SLAW. 

Shave the cabbage, putting into jar or bowl. Sprinkle salt through it 
and on top (about one cupful of salt for three cabbages). Let it stand 
twelve hours, then drain off and let stand one hour. Boil three quarts of 
vinegar, adding one ounce of whole mace and one ounce of whole black 
pepper. Let boil fifteen minutes, strain out the spice, pour hot vinegar 
over cabbage (sufficient to cover), tie a cloth over the jar and set away for 
usGo Mrs. B. MarchanTc

Peel and slice the tomatoes, mince pork very fine; put a layer of tomatoes 
in a buttered pie dish, season with sugar and pepper, strew with bread- 
crumbs, and scatter a little pork over it. V\\\ the dish in this order, having 
crumbs at the top, cover closely, and bake for one-half hour, or till the 
juice bubbles up at the side. Remove the cover, brown, and serve. If 
you do not care to use pork it can be omitted, but a little salt must be 
used. Mrs. Maggie Leahy. 

STUFFED TOMATOES. 

Get tomatoes as large and firm as possible; cut a round place in top 
of each, scrape out all the soft parts; mix with stale bread-crumbs, onions, 
parsley, butter, pepper and salt; chop very fine and fill tomatoes; care- 
fully bake in moderately hot oven; put a little butter in pan; see that they 
do not burn or become dry. Mrs. James Ladd. 

SLICED TOMATOES. 

Seald a few at a time in boiling water, peel, slice, set in a cool place,

and vinegar. Leone Dickerson. 

DEVILED TOMATOES. 

Take two or three large firm tomatoes, not over ripe, cut them in 
slices one-half inch thick an^ lay on a sieve. Make a dressing of one 
tablespoonful of butter and one of vinegar rubbed smooth with the yolk 
of one hard-boiled Qgg; add a very little sugar, salt, mustard and cayenne 
pepper; beat until smooth and heat to a boil. Take from the fire and 
pour upon a well-beaten &gg, whipping to a smooth cream. Put the ves- 
sel containing this dressing into hot water while the tomatoes are being 
broiled over a clear fire. Put the tomatoes on a hot dish and pour the 
dressing over them. Cooked in this way they will be found an exquisite 
accompaniment to roast chicken. Mrs. M. Werton.

boiling water and keep them boiling for one or two hours, or until 
tender. Do not prick them with a fork to ascertain this but press on the 
thickest part with the fingers and they will yield to the pressure. When 
done put them into cold water and rub the skin off with the hand, cutting 
them into slices of same size. They can be sent to table with no seasoning, 
or they may be returned to the fire and a very thin sauce of flour, butter 
and milk may be made and poured over them. Mrs. Annie G. 

CREAHED BEETS. 

Cut off stalks and leaves and wash the beets through three or four 
waters. Salt the water in your kettle well, and boil them till done. Peel

STEWED nU5HR00nS. 

A nice dish for the tea is made by peeling the mushrooms, and taking 
out the inner part, then broiling them on a gridiron. When the outside 
is brown, place them in a saucepan, just covering them with water. Let 
them stay in this water ten minutes, and then add a tablespoonful of white 
wine, a tablespoonful of burned sugar, and a few drops of sharp vinegar. 
Thicken with flour, milk and butter. Let them boil up a little, then toast 
bread pretty brown, lay it on a heated dish and pour the mushrooms over. 

Another way to prepare them for the table is to broil them. Select 
the largest and have a clear fire. Get the gridiron quite hot, and rub the 
bars with suet, so that the mushrooms will not stick. Lay them on the 
gridiron, with the stalks upward. Sprinkle sparingly with salt, but lav- 
ishly with pepper. Serve on a hot dish with a little butter over and under 
them. When they begin to steam they are done. Mrs. Kate Wilson. 

BROILED nUSHROOMS. 

In order to test mushrooms, sprinkle salt on the gills — if they turn

more than one; season and fill each with as much cream as it will hold. 
Place over each a custard cup, pressing weU down to the toast; set in a 
moderate oven and cook fifteen minutes. Do not remove the cups for 
five minutes after they come from the oven, as thereby the flavor of the 
mushroom is preserved in its entirety. E. J. 

EQQS AND ASPARAGUS. 

Boil young asparagus and cut it into pieces as nearly as possible like 
peas. Have ready four eggs well beaten, and flavor with pepper and salt. 
Put the asparagus with them and stir gently; then dissolve two ounces of 
butter in a stew-pan, and stir the mixture until it is thick. Serve on toast.

BOILED ARTICHOKES. 

The Jerusalem artichoke should be washed well in several waters and 
picked over carefully to see that no insects are about them. Trim the 
leaves at the bottom. Cut off the stems and put the artichokes into boil- 
ing water with a heaped tablespoonful of salt and a piece of soda the size 
of a quarter. Keep the saucepan uncovered, and let them boil quickly 
until tender. When done you can thrust a fork through them. Take 
them out, let them drain, and serve with white sauce poured over them, 
made of flour, butter, new milk, two small onions cut up thin in it, and 
pepper. A tureen of melted butter should accompany them. It takes 
twenty-five minutes to cook them, and they should be gathered two or 
three days before wanted for use. Fanny Bennet.

BOILED RICE. 

Wash well and boil a pint of rice in two quarts of slightly salted water 
for about fifteen minutes. Drain in a colander, cover with a thick cloth 
for about ten minutes so that the rice may absorb the moisture. Pick up 
with a fork into a deep dish and serve very hot. E. J. Wallace. 

FRIED EQQ PLANT. 

The ^%% plants should be cut into slices of equal thickness and put 
into water that has been strongly salted, where they should lie for an 
hour. Roll in cracker crumbs and egg and fry in butter. 

Mrs. Ellen Pinkerton. 

EQQ PLANT CAKES. 

Egg plant is nice when made into cakes. Take a small one, pare it, 
cut into pieces, and boil in salt and water until soft. Pour off the water, 
mash, add pepper, and mix with a batter made of one pint of milk, three 
eggs beaten thoroughly, two teaspoonfuls of baking-powder, a piece of 
butter the size of an ^%%, a little pinch of salt, and flour enough for a thin 
batter. Fry it as you would batter cakes. Vegetable oysters can be pre- 
pared in the same way and are very nice. Mrs. S. Stevenson. 

STUFFED EQQ PLANT. 

Cut the stem end off the egg plant, peel it, scrape out the center and 
put all together in a weak brine for forty-five minutes, drain the pieces 
scraped out of the center, chop fine, mix with a forcemeat as for stuffed 
tomatoes, adding some cream. Put into a deep earthen dish with plenty 
of butter and a little water, cover well and bake in the oven, basting fre- 
quently, until done. H. F. L. 

FRIED CUCUMBERS. 

Pare three large cucumbers, cut them in slices. Dry them with a 
clean towel. Sprinkle them with flour and place them in a pan of boiling 
Ko-nut, and turn often until they are quite brown. Remove them from 
the pan and drain the fat from them, by placing them on a sieve. Very 
good. Mrs. Reta Holmes. 

PLAIN BOILED ONIONS OR CREAHED ONIONS. 

Skin and soak them in cold water one hour, then put into a saucepan 
and cover with boiling water, well salted; when nearly done pour off the 
water, add a little milk, a little butter, and simmer till tender. Season

with pepper and salt. Or make a thickened dip of butter, flour and milk. 
Drain the onions thoroughly, cook this thickening and pour over the 

onions in a deep dish. Mrs. F. Farley. 

FRIED ONIONS. 

Peel and slice. Fry in butter with one-half cupful of water. Season 
with pepper and salt, and serve hot. Mrs. N K. B.

Wash the carrots, then scrape and cut into oblong, thin strips, boil in 

salt water until tender, then drain off nearly all the water and prepare as 

above. Jennie Adams. 

LENTILS. 

Pick the lentils over carefully, wash thoroughly and soak several 

hours, then put them on with clear cold water and boil them gentlv until 

done; heat a little butter with a little flour in it, add the onion, fry it until 

it turns yellow, drain off some of the water the lentils were boiled in, add 

them to the dressing and simmer one-half hour longer before serving. 

G.J. 
GREEN PEAS. 

When the peas are fresh, shell them and wash them in a colander in 
cold water. Then put them into cold water and let simmer twenty min- 
utes; season with plenty of butter and salt and a cupful of cream. Canned 
peas should merely be turned out of the can, liquor poured off the peas, 
rinsed, and left on to boil. When done add milk, butter and salt. When 
they have come to a boil once they are ready for the table. 

Mrs. J. S. Ring. 
PEA LOAF. 

Soak four cupfuls of split peas over night. In the morning put them 
with a small onion into a farina kettle with just enough water to cover, 
and boil until soft. Drain and pulp through a colander. Beat in a table- 
spoonful of butter, pepper, salt and three eggs. Boil in a buttered mold 
or floured cloth one hour. Turn out and cut in slices on the table. 

Mrs. B. Clayton.

Peas are exceedingly nice cooked as above with but little water. 

When done add butter but no cream. Let fry about three minutes and 

serve hot. Mrs. J. R. M. 

STEWED PEAS AND LETTUCE. 

Take a pint of shelled green peas and two heads of lettuce cut small. 
Put in as little water as possible to use and not burn, iet boil until tender, 



VEGETABLES. 471 

add a pinch of sugar and another of salt. When done stir in the well- 
beaten yolk of one egg, two tablespoonfuls of cream and a dash of pepper. 
Do not allow to boil after the &^^ is added. Serve hot. 

Mrs. N. K. Brooks. 
VEGETABLE OYSTERS. 

Cut the vegetables in thin slices, crosswise, boil in clear water until 
soft, add a cupful of milk, salt, butter and flour stirred to a cream, boil all 
together for a few minutes, then serve on toast. P. E. F. 

SUMMER SQUASH. 

The white scalloped ones are the best. Take them before the rhine 
or seeds become hard. Wash and cut in moderately small pieces. Boil 
in clear water until tender enough to mash. Then place in a colander 
and drain. Have ready some bread cut in small pieces (not crumbled). 
Now put a spoonful of good butter in a skillet. When hot put in the 
bread and stir until brown, then add the squash. Mash and mix well 
together, and season with pepper and salt. Mrs. E. A. Parcell. 

SQUASH (HUBBARD). 

Peel a squash, cut it in small pieces and boil in water that has been 

salted till done. Drain thoroughly. Then mash, adding two heaping 

tablespoonfuls of butter and a little salt and pepper. Also cream unless 

too moist. Mrs. Clara Green. 

QREENS. 

Young beet tops, dandelions, spinach, young turnip tops and chicory 
are very beneficial in the spring and they can all be cooked in the same 
way. Examine them very carefully, throwing out all wilted or tough 
ones. Wash them through several waters, so that the sand or grit may 
all be eliminated, and they are perfectly clean. All greens shrink in boil- 
ing and so judgment must be used as to the quantity to be cooked for the 
family. When they are ready for the pot have it one-half full of boiling 
water that has been salted. Cook till they are tender, drain them, and 
press them so that all the water will be out. Then season them with a 
little salt, plenty of pepper and butter. Put them in the oven in the dish 
for a few minutes, and serve them hot. String beans, peas and spinach 
should be boile.d uncovered, so as to retain their green color. 

Mrs. Amy Kent. 
PLAINLY DRESSED SPINACH. 

Pick the leaves from the stalks, and wash the spinach in several waters 
to free it from sand and grit. Put it into a large saucepan with as much 



473 VEGETABLES. 

water only as will keep it from burning; add a small spoonful of salt and 
turn it frequently till quite tender. Drain it and with a knife and fork 
cut it in small pieces and add pepper, salt and butter. Serve immediately. 

Mary Jameson. 

DANDELION AND 5PINACH GREENS. 

Gather freshly grown dandelions when the dew is on them. Use equal 
amounts of dandelion and spinach; pick over carefully, throw into cold 
v/ater and wash in several waters previously salted. Plunge the dandelion 
into boiling water, cook one-half hour before adding the spinach; continue 
the cooking until tender; then drain, add one tablespoonful of butter, a 
little salt and pepper. Mix well, turn on warm dish and garnish with 
hard-boiled e.gg. The addition of spinach prevents the bitterness of the 
dandelion from predominating, and the union will be found very pala- 
table. It cannot be too well recommended for its healthfulness. 

Mrs. Maude Blanchard. 

SPINACH FRITTERS. 

Boil spinach thoroughly, drain and mince it well; add some grated 
bread, one grate of nutmeg and a small piece of sugar. Add as much 
cream or yolks and whites of eggs as will make the preparation of the 
consistence .of batter; drop the batter into a frying pan of boiling lardv 
When the fritters rise take out, drain and send to table. E. S. 

CELERY. 

Celery makes a pretty ornament to the table and is most healthful as 

well. The smaller the stalks the more tender. Serve in celery boats, 

with just enough of the leaves to look pretty. Put in cold water one hour 

before serving to make it crisp. If necessary to keep for any length of 

time wet it thoroughly, wrap in a cloth and place in the refrigerators or 

cellar. In this way it can be kept a week if perfectly fresh when packed 

away, E. T. 

CREAM CELERY. 

Bring one pint of milk to a boil, add the celery chopped fine, then 

some butter mixed with a little flour, cream and crackers; season to taste 

and serve. F. P. 

RICE. 

Rice has come to be one of the main vegetable dishes of the present 
day. Wash the rice thoroughly, then put on with just enough cold water 
to prevent it from burning to the pot (a double boiler is best) which mnst 



VEGEIABLEb 473 

have a close-htting cover and be set on a moderate fire; add salt to ♦laste. 
The rice is steamed rather than boiled, until it is nearly done, then the 
cover is removed and a small lump of butter added. Served plain or with 
cream, sugar and nutmeg. Mrs. Stanley Arnold. 

FRIED APPLE5. 

Pare and core the apples, keeping them whole, cut into slices cross- 
wise, sprinkle with cinnamon, sugar and a little lemon juice. Stand aside 
for fifteen minutes, then dip each slice into a batter and slide quickly into 
the hot Ko-nut, fry on one side, turn, and fry on the other. G. R. 

POTATO CROQUETTES. 

One pint of mashed potatoes, a pinch of white pepper, one-half tea- 
spoonful of celery salt, one and one-half tablespoonfuls of Ko-nut, one-half 
teaspoonful of salt and the yolks of two eggs. Mix together all the 
ingredients, except the ^gg, and beat until light, then add the yolks of the 
eggs and mix well. Rub through sieve and add one teaspoonful of 
chopped parsley. Shape into smooth balls, then into cylinders. Dip in 
bread-crumbs, then in beaten eggs, then roll in crumbs again. Fry in 
deep hot Ko-nut. Drain on paper and serve on a hot dish. E. T. 

CREAMED PEAS. 

Melt two tablespoonfuls of Ko-nut in a saucepan, add ten drops of 
onion juice, three tablespoonfuls of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, one- 
quarter teaspoonful of paprica and one pint of hot milk. Serve in 
shredded wheat baskets. R. R. 

FLAKED BEAN CROQUETTES. 

Three cupfuls of flaked beans, three-fourths of a cupful of boiling 
water, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one-fourth teaspoonful of paprica and 
one Ggg, beaten. Mix all ingredients, shape roll in rice flakes, beaten egg 
iind flakes again; fry in hot Ko-nut until brown. W. W. 

BAKED SALSIFY. 

Scrape the roots, wash thoroughly, cut crosswise and boil till tender. 
Make a cream sauce of one tablespoonful each of butter and flour rubbed 
together, one pint of rich milk, salt and pepper and heat to boiling point. 
Butter a baking pan, put in a layer of bread-crumbs, a layer of cream 
sauce, a layer of salsify and so on till the dish is nearly filled. Pour 
cream sauce over the last layer, then bread-crumbs and bits of butter ana 
bake brown. Mrs. E. A. B.

476 VEGETABLES, 

adhere to the bottom of the pan. Then take a deep dish, butter it well, 
and place a layer of macaroni, then a layer of grated cheese, adding salt, 
pepper and butter to each layer. Continue these layers until the dish is 
full, then cover with sweet milk. Beat two eggs in milk, and pour over 
Bake three-quarters of an hour. If you shave the cheese very thin it will 
answer as well as to grate it. Use old strong cheese. 

Mrs. Annie R. Gregory. 

SPAGHETTI.

twenty-five minutes to boil it. Mrs. G. Atwood. 

VEGETABLE CURRY. 

A mixture of vegetables may be used for curry. The most suitable 
are celery, onions, cauliflowers, young cabbages, cucumbers, green peas, 
French beans, spinach and sorrel. Mince or slice the vegetables. Dis- 
solve a slice of fresh butter in a stew-pan; roll the vegetables in curry- 
powder and toss them in the butter till they are one-half dressed. Pour 
over them as much cream or gravy mixed smoothly with curry-powder or 
paste as will cover them, and stew till tender. Add a little salt and serve 
with rice boiled for curry on a separate dish. A tablespoonful of lemon 
juice is an improvement. If liked a small quantity of mashed potatoes or 
fried onions and an apple rubbed through a sieve may be added to the 
curry sauce. Shrimps or prawns may also be added if approved.

MEATS — HOW AND WHAT TO SELECT. 

See Chapter entitled "Meats" in order to understand which pieces are most nourishing, 
which most strengthening, and which most desirable. 




ALADS 

WITHOUT MEATS. 



A MONG the vegetables peculiarly fitted for the 
^~^ making of fine salads are celery, tomatoes, 
cucumbers, onions, lentils, cabbage, green beans, 
lettuce, cauliflower, water cress and radishes. To 
this may be added chervil, which is never absent 
from a French or English salad. It is much like parsley, but far more 
aromatic, and is used in much the same way. It can be procured at most 
of the vegetable markets, but in preparing a salad with it, the leaves 
alone are taken; the root being highly poisonous. 

In preparing vegetables designed for salads it is proper to throw 
them into cold water for a short time, then carefully dry and lay them 
away until wanted. Never mix with the dressing until ready for use. 

DRESSING FOR COLD SLAW. 

Mix together one tablesooonful of dry mustard, three-fourths of a 
teaspoonful of sugar, salt-sooonful of salt. Stir smooth and add one- 
quarter of a pint ot cream. Let these come to a boil just once, stirring all 
the time. Take it from the stove and beat in two eggs, which have 
previously been whipped well. Place the sauce back on the stove, letting 
it stand over a dish of boiling water. Keep stirring until thick, then add 
one-quarter of a pint of vinegar. This is a good sauce for slaw or cold 
meats. Mrs. Maude Blanchard. 

For Mayonnaise and French Dressings see "Salads with Meats." 

BOILED SALAD DRESSINQ. 

Three eggs, one tablespoonful each of sugar, oil and salt, a scant 
tablespoonful of mustard, a cupful of milk and one cupful of vinegar; stir 
oil, salt, mustard and sugar in a bowl until perfectly smooth; then add eggs 
and beat well after, add vinegar and finally the milk; place all in a rice or 
custard boiler; keep constantly stirring for about twelve or fifteen minutes. 
until it is as thick as rich cream. This will keep in a cool place for two 
weeks. Mr.s. W. P. Saunders.

oil. Let stand ten minutes and serve. Senora Carmona. 

inPERIAL SALAD. 

Cut off some green asparagus tips one inch in length; cook them in 

salted water; drain and lay in a bowl, seasoning with salt, pepper, oil and 

vinegar; cut some cooked truffles the same length as the asparagus, season 

the same and one-half hour later lay them on a sie-re to drain well, then 

add them to the asparagus and mingle with mayonnaise. 

Delmonico's. 
CABBAGE SALAD. 

One or two eggs, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one-half cupful of 
vinegar, one-half cupful of cream, one-half teaspoonful of mustard, chop 
the cabbage very fine and season with salt; beat the eggs and sugar 
together, then add the vinegar and mustard, set in a pan of boiling water 
(or use a rice steamer), and stir until thoroughly cooked and thick; let 
stand in china or glass dish until cold and just before serving add the 
cream and pour over the cabbage. Very delicate if well made. 

Mrs. B. Dennxg.

beans, beets and potatoes cut fine. Add a little minced onion, cover with 
salad dressing, mix lightly and serve cold. Lillie Tibbitts. 

CHERRY SALAD. 

Arrange lettuce leaves prettily on flat dish; seed the cherries and 
place a hazel-nut in center to keep shape; put cherries through the 
leaves; pour mayonnaise dressing to which has been added a tablespoon- 
ful of cherry juice, instead of vinegar; then put a few cherries over the 

top- loNE Anderson. 

ORANGE SALAD. 

For poultry or game, orange salad will be found particularly delicious. 
Tart, juicy oranges should be sliced and the seeds removed. Arrange in 
a salad dish with or without lettuce and dress with lemon juice, salad oil, 
a sprinkling of salt and a dash of cayenne. H. F. 

QRAPE SALAD. 

A very choice salad for a luncheon course is the following: Select the 
large white or light green grapes with tender skin, remove them from the 
stem, wash and take out seeds, taking care to preserve the shape of the 
grape. Fill the vacancy with any favorite nuts — pecans, hickory or 
the like. Let cool, arrange on plates and spread over a generous amount 
of mayonnaise. Serve at once. A. C. 

BEET SALAD. 

Parboil beet, remove the skin, cut it into thin slices, and stew with

sliced beet on the dish, placing the onions between them. It is served 
cold with cheese and with vinegar poured over. L. S, 

CELERY SALAD. 

Pare the stalks from three bunches of celery, clean them, wipe dry 
with a napkin, chop and fill a salad bowl, adding a very little salt, pepper 
and three tablespoonfuls of good vinegar. Do not use any oil. 

Mrs. H. E. Heath. 

WATER-CRESS SALAD. 

Use the tender leaves of the cress. Let them stand in cold water to 
make them crisp and then wipe dry. * Sprinkle a teaspoonful of parsley 
and olives chopped fine. Add a few slices of sour apples and pour over 
it the French dressing which is made of one tablespoonful of vinegar, 
three tablespoonfuls of oil, one-half teaspoonful of salt and one-quarter of 
a teaspoonful of pepper. The two latter ingredients should be mixed 
with the oil and the vinegar stirred in slowly. To garnish water-cress a 
hard-boiled ^gg chopped fine and scattered over it is an improvement. 

Mrs. M. J. Town. 

STRING BEAN SALAD. 

Cook a quart of string beans, after having stringed and cut the ends 
off, in boiling water, well salted. When tender, take them out with the 
skimmer and put them into cold water. Drain them from this water 
thoroughly so they will be nearly dry. Place them in a salad dish, chop 
parsley, onion, and chervil over them, pour in some French dressing and 
it is ready for the table. Phebe Metcalf. 

BEAN SALAD. 

Soak a quart of beans three hours and boil them till tender, changing 
the water before boiling. When drained and thoroughly cold, chop some

The principle of fireless cooking is simply the retaining of heat by 
insulation, just as cold is retained in the icebox or refrigerator by insula- 
tion. Ordinarily, we heat food to the boiling point and then leave it over the 
fire or in the oven to keep it at a cooking degree of heat; and to do this, 
on account of radiation, we must keep on supplying heat. 

When cooking in the fireless cookers, or fireless stoves, the insulation 
of the device retains all the heat, thus maintaining a cooking temperature 
without adding more heat. Thus we secure economy in fuel. A good fire- 
less cooker will save three-fourths of the gas, wood, or coal used when 
cooking in a kitchen range. 

The use of the fireless cooker is spreading rapidly, on account of its 
obvious saving in fuel, time, work and worry. It consists of a box or chest 
packed with a good non-conductor of heat, into which a kettle containing 
the food heated to the boiling point is placed. The lid, consisting of the 
same non-conducting material, is closed, and the heat cannot escape, conse- 
quently the water in the kettle remains at the boiling point for several hours, 
and the food is bound to cook the same as if it were on the stove. These 
cookers are now being manufactured by many firms. Among the best are 
the Duplex Stove, manufactured by The Durham Manufacturing Co. of 
Muncie, Ind., and the Ideal Fireless Cook Stove, made by The Toledo Cooker 
Co. of Toledo, Ohio. 

In the fireless cooker, there is no evaporation. All the goodness and 
flavor of the food is retained by this slow and thorough mode of cooking. 
Onions and cabbage may be cooked without the odor permeating the house. 
While doing the morning dishes, you can cook what you want for the next 
meal, put the kettles in the fireless cooker, and attend to other things, or go 
out, without the slightest anxiety, and at meal time find it hot and deli'ciously 
cooked. 

You can cook the oatmeal, or any cereal for five minutes at night, put it 
in the fireless cooker, and find it thoroughly cooked and hot at any time in 
the morning when needed. You can cook a boiled dinner, on a hot summer 
day, without any odor or heat in your kitchen. All this can be done on a 
fireless cooker. 

486a 



486b FIRELESS COOKERY 

In the modern fireless cookstove food may be roasted, baked, steamed, 
stewed or boiled. In it can be cooked fish, oysters, clams and all sea-foods; 
baked beans; vegetable dinner; beef, pork, mutton, spare ribs, ham, chicken, 
duck, goose, turkey, squabs — meats, fowls and poultry of every description; 
corn, peas, beets, beans, squash, cabbage, turnips, onions, all vegetables and 
garden sauce; oatmeal, cracked wheat, barley, rice, hominy, every kind of 
breakfast food ; soup, broth, meat juices, etc. ; bread, cake, pies and puddings 
of every kind; custards, fruit sauces, etc. All foods are better when cooked 
in a fireless range. 

How to Prepare the Food. — Prepare the food for fireless cooking as 
you would for the old style stove, using your favorite recipe or the recipe of 
any standard cookbook. Fireless cooking does not demand any new knowl- 
edge about the preparation of the food. 

Utensils to Be Used. — A standard equipment of aluminum kettles is 
usually furnished with a good modern fireless stove, but any utensil that will 
fit in the cooking compartment may be used. 

Three Methods of Cooking. — In a typical modern fireless range, three 
methods are employed for cooking. One is with heated disks or radiators 
only, and the food is placed in the range cold and raw. The second method is 
to first heat the food, or bring it to the boiling point and place it in the fireless 
range without the heated radiators. The third method is a combination: 
The food is heated or brought to the boiling point, and placed in the fireless 
range with heated radiators. 

The first method is used for roasting and baking meats and fowls, bread, 
cake, pies, tomatoes, potatoes, macaroni, beans, etc. — for all foods that are 
roasted or baked. 

The second method is used for all foods that are boiled; meats, vege- 
tables, cereals, etc 

The third method Is used for all foods and all cooking and is a matter 
of judgment with the operator. 

Cooking Time. — The time which should be allowed for cooking food in 
a fireless range depends upon the temperature of the radiators. Under 
ordinary conditions allow the same time for cooking in the fireless range as 
for cooking by the old-style stove. For meats and fowls allow about twenty 
minutes to the pound. Meats, fish, fowls, beans and the majority of foods 
can be kept in the fireless range for hours after cooking is completed and will 
be hot, savory and delicious when ready to eat. The cooking process con- 



FIRELESS COOKERY 486c 

tinues until the food is thoroughly cooked, after which the food is retained 
in that state. Meats desired rare must be removed from the range at the 
specified time. If you wish the food to remain rare, yet hot for hours, 
remove the radiators and leave meat in the range with the cover closed. Cab- 
bage, carrots and such foods may be left in the fireless range for hours after 
the cooking process is finished. Potatoes, green corn, biscuits and similar 
foods should be removed from the range when cooked. 

Care of the Fireless Cook Stove.— A good modern tireless range, with 
metal linings and utensils of aluminum is the most sanitary cooking device 
in the world. Nothing can enter the cooking food through the range and 
there is no possible way by which the range itself can impart any unnatural 
odor or flavor to the food. In this, as in every other detail, the fireless sur- 
passes the old-style stove. Nevertheless, the interior of the range, also the 
radiators and cooking utensils, must be kept clean. The interior of the 
range and all parts accompanying, as well as the radiators, should be well 
wiped off before using for the first time. The interior of the range should 
be wiped out with a damp cloth after each cooking, and the cover of the 
range left open. This will keep the range sweet and clean. 

How to Cook Successfully. — Good cooking — whether it be done with 
the fireless stove, the gas stove, the electric stove, or the ordinary kitchen 
stove— requires patience, experience, good judgment, and some knowledge 
of the effect of moist and dry heat upon certain foods. 

You can not put hastily and poorly prepared dishes in the fireless stove 
and take them out as triumphs of culinary art. But after a little experience 
the average cook will have no difficulty in cooking in a fireless stove. 

Always bear in mind that the essential thing in successful fireless cook- 
ing is to have enough heat units confined in the fireless stove, when closed, 
to cook the food. 

Bear in mind that a kettle full of boiling food will keep hot longer than 
a kettle only partly filled; and when boiling, steaming or stewing a small 
quantity of food, it is advisable to use the top vessel and put boiling water 
in the lower vessel. 

When cooking two articles of food, it is better to place the vessel con- 
taining the smaller quantity on top of the vessel containing the larger quan- 
tity of food. 

The length of time it takes to cook food thoroughly in the fireless stove 
can be only approximately given. The time required depends on the kind 



486d FIRELESS COOKERY 

of food being prepared, the amount of heat units in the hot disks or radiators 
and contained in the food itself when confined in the fireless stove. 

The necessary thing to do is to place the food in the fireless stove in 
plenty of time, so there will be no need to remove it before the time it is 
required for use. A good fireless stove will usually retain a cooking tem- 
perature from four to five hours, and the food can be left in the stove four 
or five hours longer before it cools. 

To sum the matter up, skill in cooking in a fireless stove means a com- 
bination of experience and judgment obtained by following the directions 
of the manufacturer of the particular stove that is used. 

Use of Water in Cooking. — For fireless cooking, do not use as much 
water as a recipe specifies for cooking by the old stove method. Usually 
about one-half as much water is sufficient. 

When roasting meats or fowls, NO water is used. 

FIRELESS COOKING OF CEREALS. 

Oatmeal and cereals of all kinds are best cooked by the fireless method. 
A much enjoyed feature of the fireless cookstove is the "over-night" cooking. 
Cereals and food placed in the cooker at night "cook while you sleep" and 
are ready to be eaten at breakfast — any hour. All the health-giving substance, 
all the delightful flavor, is there waiting for a hungry breakfast appetite. 
Should the cooked cereal not be warm enough to serve, a few minutes over 
the flame of any stove will give it the temperature desired. 

Several methods may be followed in cooking cereals, thus : 

Cereal first brought to boiling point and placed in cooker without 
radiator. 

Cereal first brought to boil and placed in the cooker with heated radiator. 

Cereal placed in cooker cold and raw with heated radiator. 

Or, cooked with "double boiler." A double boiler is made by placing a 4- 
quart utensil inside of an 8-quart utensil. When cooked this way the food 
is usually brought to a boil and boiling water poured in the 8-quart utensil 
up nearly to the top of the 4-quart utensil. Use one radiator. 

Cooks differ as to which of the above methods they prefer; however, the 
majority seem in favor of the "double boiler" method. 

CORN MEAL MUSH. 

One cup corn meal, one teaspoon salt, three cups water. Slowly stir the 
meal into boiling salted water, being careful not to lump. Allow to boil 



FIRELESS COOKERY 486e 

slowly for ten minutes, place in cooker and allow to remain eight to ten hours 
or all night. Use one radiator. If you wish to fry mush use less water. 

OATMEAL. 

One cup oatmeal, one teaspoon salt, three cups water. Stir meal into 
boiling salt water, boil five minutes, place in cooker over night. Use one 
radiator. 

BOILED RICE. 

One cup rice, five cups water, two teaspoons salt. Clean and wash rice, 
then stir it into boiling salted water and allow to boil five minutes. Place 
kettle in cooker and allow to remain three hours. It may be left over night 
without overcooking. Use one radiator. 

SOUP. 

The real value of Soup is brought out in a fireless cooker. Meats and 
bones for soup cost but little and by using the fireless method the real expense 
of the dish — the long cooking over a fire and constant watching, is done 
away with, and it becomes one of the most economical as well as healthful 
of foods. The foundation of all soups is the juice or extracts of meats, 
poultry, etc., that are used, and the true flavor and the nutriment of these 
things are developed more fully in a fireless cooker than when cooked by any 
other method. 

FISH. 

Fish cooked in a fireless cooker is delightful. Fish is a food that may 
be easily cooked over a blaze, but the fireless is especially serviceable for 
cooking fish when one wishes to find the meal cooked when arriving home, 
as fish does not become soft nor fall to pieces by standing a considerable 
length of time in the fireless cookstove. 

MEATS. 

All meats are best cooked in a fireless cooker. The more expensive meats 
are not necessarily the most nutritious. If the housewife thoroughly under- 
stands the right way to prepare the cheaper meats, and has a fireless cook 
stove, it is possible to have a tender and juicy piece of meat at a comparatively 
small cost. Meat, although one of the most important foods — and one of the 
most expensive — is too often ruined in the cooking. By the stove method 
mtich of the rich, juicy nutriments are cooked out of the meat, leaving it a 
hard, leathery fiber. Meats cooked in a fireless stove do not lose in weight, 
because nothing escapes, and there is no shrinkage from evaporation. It is a 
recognized fact that the tough meats can be reduced to toothsome tender- 



486f FIRELESS COOKERY 

ness if steamed in a closed roaster for several hours. This is the principle of 
the fireless cooker. 

BROWN BEEF STEW. 
Cut two pounds of beef into small cubes. Roll them in flour. Put 
two tablespoons of suet in sauce pan, shake it over the fire until it is well 
melted. Remove the cracklings and throw in the meat. Shake over fire until 
slightly browned. Draw the meat to one side of the pan, add two table- 
spoons of flour to the fat. When smooth, add one quart of stock, one tea- 
spoon of salt, one onion, one bay leaf, one small carrot, one saltspoon of 
pepper and one teaspoon of some good sauce. Place in fireless cookstove for 
three hours, using two radiators. 

BEEF AU GRATIN. 

Put in baking dish a layer of bread crumbs, then some thin slices of fat 
salt pork, slices of cold cooked beef, onion, parsley and another layer of 
crumbs, until the dish is full; pour over all any left-over gravy so as to 
moisten. Bake in the fireless cooker for one hour. Use two radiators. 

BOILED DINNER. 

Take three or four pounds of corned beef, cover with cold water and let 
boil slowly for twenty minutes. Then skim and add a small cabbage, a few 
carrots, potatoes and turnips and boil for five minutes. Place in the fireless 
stove for four hours, llse one radiator. 

ROAST CHICKEN. 

The time necessary for roasting a chicken depends on the age of the 
bird. One hour and a half is sufficiently long for a young chicken, but an 
older one should be roasted two hours, and a very tough chicken three 
hours. If this course is followed, old chickens will turn out as tender and 
savory as spring chickens. Prepare the chicken in your usual method for 
the oven. It will not be necessary to heat the chicken to brown it before it 
has been placed in the fireless. If both radiators are made very hot the 
chicken when roasted will turn out nicely browned. The chicken, therefore, 
can be placed cold in the vessel and placed at once in the cooker for roasting. 
It is not necessary to open the cooker for basting as the hot steam prevents 
burning. 

CHICKEN STEW. 

Clean chicken and cut into small pieces. Put in kettle and cover with 
water; allow to boil slowly for thirty minutes; season with pepper and salt, 
and place in cooker for six hours. Remove from cooker and add thickening. 



FIRELESS COOKERY 486g 

Serve on toast or the stew may again be brought to the boiHng point and 
dumpHngs added and the kettle replaced in the cooker for thirty minutes. 
Use one radiator. 

POT ROAST. 

« 

Place pot roast in the tireless cook stove with salt and pepper only, 
omitting any water. Place one sizzling hot radiator above and one below 
and roast as desired. If rare do not give so long a time. 

ROAST PORK. 

Select a piece suitable in shape for fitting in the larger vessel and cook 
from one hour and a half to three hours, according to the size of the roast. 
Use two radiators. 

STEAK AND ONIONS. 

Select a thick steak and butter on both sides ; slice the onions thin and lay 
a layer of onions on top of the steak. Place in shallow cooking vessel and 
put in cooker. Use both radiators, the same as in the roast, and leave it in 
for about three-quarters of an hour. 

SWEETBREADS. 

Wash sweetbreads and soak in slightly salted water for one hour. 
Plunge them in boiling salted water and boil three minutes. Place in cooker 
for two hours. Then plunge them in cold water; when chilled remove mem- 
brane. They may be rolled in crumbs and tgg and fried, or broken in small 
pieces to cream. Use one radiator. 

VEGETABLES. 

As with other foods, vegetables are cooked best in a fireless range, be- 
cause the food value and taste are developed. For those vegetables that are 
cooked or boiled in water, the same recipes can be applied as for an ordinary 
stove or range. It is only necessary to put sufficient boiling water over the 
vegetables before placing in the cooker and use one radiator. When baking 
vegetables two radiators are used. Vegetables may be cooked by all of the 
three methods previously explained, and each housewife should determine to 
her own satisfaction which method gives the best results. 

All good cooks are aware that some kinds of vegetables are better when 
cooked at a smart boil, such as potatoes and other vegetables containing a 
large percentage of starch; while other vegetables, such as parsnips, carrots 
and turnips, containing but little starch, are hardened by high heat and should 
be cooked slowly without radiators. Again, green peas and asparagus, con- 
taining much sugar, are better cooked without the radiators, as there will be 
no violent boiling. 



c 



The modern housekeeper has begun to learn that there are other ways of 
cooking food than by broihng, boihng or roasting, all of which processes 
call for a high degree of heat. She has come to know that long, slow 
cooking at a gentle heat best conserves the nutritive elements of food and 
the flavors that render it most agreeable to us. It is this method of cooking 
that the earthen casserole, with its close-fitting cover, has made possible 
for us. 

Then, too, the casserole is the serving as well as the cooking dish; and, 
besides, as from its nature it retains heat for a long time, the food presented 
in it may be kept in good condition for the late comer or tardy diner. 

The casserole may be, also, the main dependence of the woman who does 
her own work and likes to serve her meals daintily in courses. The viands 
cooked in the casserole, whether of fish, flesh or fowl, nicely seasoned, and 
ready to serve, will not deteriorate, if they be left in the oven while the ap- 
petizer and soup are being eaten; they may be brought to the table without 
further manipulation or a minute's delay. 

Hence in the modern kitchen we find many earthen pots, pans, teapots, 
custard cups, shirrers, au gratin dishes, ramekins (French ramequins) , rare- 
bit dishes, and casseroles, round and oval. 

Within the last few years the use of the casserole in American cookery 
has been greatly extended and developed by the fact that American potteries 
now manufacture casseroles which successfully compete with the imported 
French ware and secure results that satisfy the most fastidious cook and the 
most exacting epicurean taste. 

The French pottery, though regarded by some as superior to the Amer- 
ican product, suffers the handicaps of heavy transportation and tariff ex- 
penses. American-made cooking and serving dishes of this brown, white- 
lined, enameled ware have therefore attained a great success. The first 
manufacturer could not make it fast enough to supply all the people who 
clamored for it. The low price of the domestic ware in casseroles, ramekins 
(individual dishes), teapots, etc., was a surprise to housekeepers, while its 
finish and wearing qualities gained their admiration. 

486h 



CASSEROLE COOKERY 486i 

The slogan, "Cook and Serve in the Same Dish," used by the pioneer 
manufacturer in America, described the principle of casserole cookery, with 
which millions of Americans are now familiar. The casserole proper is 
essentially a baker, or dish in which foods may be conveniently baked and 
then served without removal from the dish. In the most common form it 
has either one long handle or two short lug handles. And casserole cookery 
is popular because the earthenware dishes can be so easily and thoroughly 
cleaned. They do not retain odors, but can l^e kept scrupulously wholesome, 
sweet and chemically clean. 

Like all vessels of earthenware, casseroles can be broken if improperly 
used. Treated rationally, they are of long endurance and wear splendidly. 
Accidents may occur to the best housekeepers, and earthenware will get 
broken, but the casserole need not and will not be broken in ordinary, every- 
day cooking if used for the definite purposes for which it is designed. 

For the processes of cooking that require the highest temperatures, as 
sauteing meats; pan-broiling chops or steaks; frying croquettes or dough- 
nuts; and roasting meats uncovered and basted with fat only, the casserole 
is not to be recommended. But it has its own particular place in cookery 
and for many purposes is unequaled. 

There is something irresistibly tempting, indescribable in charm, and 
really fascinating in the service of food en casserole. There is such an at- 
mosphere of good fellowship, and wholesome hospitality around about such 
dishes that every genuine home-maker and lover of good living will readily 
become an enthusiast in casserole cookery. 

Casserole cookery is neither the mysterious nor the difficult art that the 
uninitiated might imagine. It can be easily cultivated, and will repay the 
mistress of the art a hundred-fold in saving of time, money and labor. The 
least expensive cuts of meat fare as happily in the casserole as those of 
extravagant prices. It is an ancient bird indeed and tough and poor the 
meat that will not yield to the gentle persuasiveness of a simmering process 
and surrender their flavors to the subtle influence of cookery in a casserole. 

Directions for Use. — In dishes where the success of the cooking depends 
upon that long, slow simmering process which breaks up fiber and connective 
tissue, it is an excellent plan to cut out a piece of heavy paper, a little larger 
than the cover, so that the edges may extend half an inch or more, grease the 
paper, lay over top of dish, place on the cover, and this will assist in making 
a "steam-proof" lining to the cover and prevent the escape of flavors. 

The perfect control of heat is also essential in casserole cookery. When 



486} CASSEROLE COOKING 

cooking is being done on top of range, with wood, coal or gas as the fuel, 
an asbestos mat placed underneath will modify the heat. The asbestos mat 
may also be used in the oven. If the heat must be intense for other foods in 
progress of cooking at the same time that you would have a delicate morsel 
in the casserole in the oven, control the heat by placing the casserole in a pan 
of water which can be lowered in temperature by occasional supplies of cold 
water added to the hot water. 

To serve casserole dishes, if necessary, clean quickly when removed from 
the oven, with clean cloth dipped in hot water; place on a plate with napkin 
or paper doily underneath. Keep covered between serving so that food may 
remain hot throughout the meal. 

In cooking chicken, veal and the like en casserole, after the vegetables, 
mushrooms and wine have been added, press a strip of dough over the meeting 
line of cover and dish; this will swell in the heat and hermetically seal the 
casserole. 

When the dish is taken from the oven for serving, scrape from it the 
dough, but do not open the casserole until it has been set upon the table ; the 
pottery cover is removed with a napkin by the waitress after placing the 
casserole upon the table. Any kind of dough at hand may be used to seal a 
casserole, but if it be necessary to prepare it expressly for this purpose, stir 
into a generous cup of flour as much water as is needed to form a stiff 
dough, then knead and roll it under the hands into a strip and use as indicated 
above. 

In using earthenware, great care should be exercised, especially if the 
dish is new, not to change the temperature suddenly from hot to cold, or 
from cold to hot, lest the ware be cracked, for heat expands and cold con- 
tracts. Earthenware hardens with usage, and in time becomes very, very 
durable. 

SQUABS EN CASSEROLE. 

Clean and truss four or five squabs. Put into frying-pan two tablespoons 
each of butter, fat from bacon, and finely cut, lean raw ham. When hot 
brown squabs quickly and remove to the casserole. To fat in pan add two 
tablespoons flour, and, when blended, add one-fourth teaspoon salt, few 
grains pepper, one pint of stock or water, sprig parsley, slice of onion, half 
stock celery. Let cook few minutes, then turn over squabs. Cover closely 
and put in oven and let cook from two to four hours, slowly, according to. 
tenderness of squabs. When nearly done, remove parsley and celery, add

half dozen pimolas, cut in thin sHces, and simmer on top of range for a few 
minutes. Serve from casserole at table. 

CHICKEN EN CASSEROLE. 

Separate the chicken into pieces at the joints and wipe each with a wet 
cloth ; saute in butter melted in a frying pan, first on one side and then on the 
other, then transfer the pieces to the casserole; add about a pint of hot, 
white broth (made from veal or chicken) or boiling water, put on the cover 
and let cook in a moderately heated oven about one hour and a quarter. Melt 
two or three tablespoonfuls of butter in the frying pan and in it saute six 
or eight peeled mushroom caps, a dozen slices or balls (cut with French 
cutter) of carrot, two dozen potato balls, and six peeled onions the size of 
the potato balls. As soon as these are browned remove them to the casserole, 
add more broth, if needed, four tablespoonfuls of sherry wine, and salt to 
season ; set the cover in place, seal the dish with paste, and return to the oven 
for another half hour or until the vegetables are tender, when the chicken 
should be cooked. 

SWEETBREADS EN CASSEROLE. 

Parboil one pound sweetbreads in salted, acidulated water for about 
twenty minutes. Drain and cool for subsequent cooking. Melt one rounding 
tablespoon butter and add one rounding tablespoon flour. When blended 
add one-fourth teaspoon salt, few grains white pepper, few grains mace, 
grated peel from one-fourth lemon and add one and one-half cups milk 
gradually. Cook to thicken smoothly. Have ready in casserole the sweet- 
breads cut in small pieces. Over them pour the hot sauce, and add one-half 
cup diced mushrooms. Cover and let simmer for twenty minutes. Serve 
from casserole on triangles of hot, buttered toast. Will serve four or 
five persons. 

MUSHROOMS STEWED IN CREAM. 

Clean one pound fresh mushrooms. Break into pieces, if large. Saute 
in hot butter. Put into casserole. Cover with rich milk or cream, and let 
simmer gently for twenty minutes. To thicken cream, blend smoothly one 
level tablespoon flour with three or four tablespoons milk for each cup of 
milk used for stewing. Add thickening to mushrooms when about half done. 
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Will serve four persons. 

BEEFSTEAK EN CASSEROLE. 

Use two pounds of round steak cut from one inch to one inch and a half 
thick. The steak may be left whole or cut into pieces two inches square. 



4861 CASSEROLE COOKING 

Heat an iron frying pan, rub over the surface with a bit of fat from the meat, 
put in the steak, and cook first on one side and then on the other to harden 
the meat on the outside and thus keep in the juices; put the meat into the 
casserole; put in also a dozen and a half pieces each of carrot and turnip. 
The vegetables may be cut in similar shaped slices, cubes or triangles, or they 
may be cut into balls with a French cutter, add also about a dozen very small 
onions, nicely peeled, a tablespoonful of favorite sauce, and a generous 
pint of brown stock or boiling water. Cover, and let cook very gently 
in the oven for an hour and a half. After cooking an hour, add salt and 
more broth if needed. Serve from the casserole. The vegetables may be 
browned in one-fourth cup of dripping before being put into the casserole. 
For this style of cooking, round steak gives a richer dish than does a sirloin 
steak, and should be selected, when the cooking is to be done in the casserole. 

POTTED OX TAIL. 

Cut two ox tails each into two or three pieces and put into large casserole. 
Into the frying-pan put three slices bacon and try out. Add one onion, sliced, 
one level teaspoon sugar and brown well together. When browned, pour 
on l^int boiling water, let boil up once and strain into casserole. Add one- 
fourth cup cut carrot, one-half cup celery, three or four cloves and one small 
bay leaf. Cover closely and simmer slowly for two hours. Add one round- 
ing teaspoon salt when half cooked, also one-half cup white wine, if desired. 
When meat is tender, pour off and strain stock. Melt and brown one round- 
ing tablespoon butter, add two slightly rounding tablespoons flour and brown. 
Then add gradually one pint strained stock. Let cook smoothly, add one- 
half teaspoon of a good sauce, pour over meat in casserole. Let heat well 
together and serve from casserole. 

POTATOES EN CASSEROLE. 

Melt one-fourth cup of butter (the clear fat from bacon or salt pork 
or the fat taken from the top of a kettle of soup are all well adapted to this 
use) in frying pan. Have ready nearly a quart of balls cut from pared 
potatoes with a French cutter, washed in cold water, and dried in a cloth. 
Turn the balls into the hot fat, and add a teaspoon ful of salt and a grating 
(about a teaspoonful) of onion. Shake the frying pan over a brick fire to 
brown the potatoes; then add brown stock or boiling water nearly to cover 
the potatoes, and heat the whole to the boiling point. Add a tablespoon of 
chopped parsley and turn into a casserole, cover close, and let cook in a 
moderate oven about forty minutes. Serve from the dish. Balls cut from 



CASSEROLE COOKING 486m 

turnips, carrots and Jerusalem artichokes, as also pieces of celery, an inch 
and a half in length, may be cooked in the same way. When the cooking is 
finished there should not be a superfluity of liquid in the dish — just enough 
to serve a scant tablespoonful with each service of vegetable. 

FRICASSEE OF RABBIT. 

Separate a rabbit into joints for serving. Saute in hot fat from bacon or 
salt pork until browned lightly. Add one tablespoon butter to fat remaining 
in pan and saute one small onion, sliced, one-fourth pound lean ham, cut in 
dice, and one small sweet pepper cut in strips. Stir until brown, then add two 
cups of stock, one-third cup white wine, if desired, and let simmer for half 
an hour. Blanch one cup rice and dispose rice over rabbit as it is laid in 
casserole. Add the stock and season as required. Cover closely and cook in 
moderate oven, one hour or longer, according to tenderness of rabbit. Serve 
from casserole. Chicken may be cooked in same way. 

HUNGARIAN GOULASCH. 

Slice a peeled onion and cook it until brown in three tablespoonfuls of 
fat fried out of salt pork ; take out the onion and turn in a pound and a half 
of lean, uncooked veal cut in inch cubes; stir and cook the meat until slightly 
browned, then rejecting the fat, if there be any in the pan, dispose the meat 
in a casserole ; add about a pint of broth, or boiling water, and a teaspoonful 
of paprika, cover the dish and set to cook in the oven. In the meantime 
add more fat to the frying pan, and when hot, brown in about a dozen balls 
cut from pared potatoes, and a dozen small onions; when the onions are 
well browned, add them to the casserole, and after the meat has been cook- 
ing an hour, add a teaspoonful of salt and the potatoes, and, if desired, two 
tablespoonfuls of flour mixed to a thin paste with cold water. Let cook 
in all about two hours. Serve from the casserole. 

AU GRATIN DISHES. 

"Au gratin" dishes are exceedingly popular, and, deservedly so. Pota- 
toes, cauliflower, tgg plant, cabbage, macaroni, celery, rice, Brussels sprouts, 
hominy, tomatoes, oysters, shrimps, fish and asparagus vie with each other 
as favorites in this repertory of dishes. 

CAULIFLOWER WITH CHEESE AU GRATIN. 

Have ready a cauliflower cooked in boiling, salted water until tender. 
Separate the cauliflower into flowerets, and dispose these, stems downward, 
in ramekins. For a medium sized cauliflower melt three tablespoonfuls of 
butter and cook in it three tablespoonfuls of flour, half a teaspoonful of salt 



486n CASSEROLE COOKING 

and a dash of paprika; then add a cup and a half of milk, and stir until the 
sauce boils, then stir in a cup of grated cheese and pour a little of the sauce 
over the cauliflower in each ramekin. Stir a cup of fine cracker crumbs into 
one-third cup of melted butter; sprinkle these over the cauliflower and 
sauce, and set the ramekins into the oven to brown the crumbs. Serve in 
the ramekins as a vegetable entree. 

HALIBUT POULETTE IN RAMEKINS AU GRATIN. 

Pick a cup and a half of cooked halibut into small pieces; add to it 
the sifted yolks and chopped whites of four hard-cooked eggs. Make a white 
sauce of three tablespoonfuls, each, of butter and flour, half a teaspoonful, 
each, of salt and paprika, one cup of chicken broth and half a cup of cream, 
or a cup and a half of milk. Stir the fish and eggs into the sauce. Put the 
mixture into buttered ramekins, spread over the top a cup of cracker crumbs, 
mixed with one-third cup of melted butter and set into the oven to brown 
the crumbs. Serve at once. Lobster, shrimps, salmon or other cooked fish 
may be used for this dish. 

POTATOES AU GRATIN. 

Reheat two cups of cold boiled potatoes, cut in dice, in one and one- 
fourth cups of white sauce, prepared as follows : Put two tablespoons butter 
in saucepan, stir until melted and bubbling; add one and one-half tablespoons 
flour, mixed with one-fourth teaspoonful of salt and a few grains of pepper, 
and stir until thoroughly blended. Pour on gradually one cup of milk, 
adding about one-third at a time, stirring until well mixed, then beating until 
smooth and glossy. Put in buttered oval baking dish or casserole, cover with 
buttered crumbs, and bake until crumbs are brown. 

STUFFED SQUASH AU GRATIN. 

Peel, wash and boil tender three or four summer squashes. Have ready 
a small squash, steamed whole until tender. With a small biscuit cutter, 
score scallops near the top of the squash, to remove a piece from the top. 
Through this opening take out the seeds to leave a perfect shell. Mash the 
boiled squashes and add a beaten tgg mixed with half a cup of scalded cream, 
two or three tablespoonfuls of butter, half a teaspoonful or more of salt 
and a dash of pepper; mix thoroughly and turn into the squash shell, set in 
an au gratin dish. Spread cracker crumbs, mixed with melted butter, over 
the top of the squash and bake about twenty minutes.

NEW WAYS TO SERVE EGGS. 

SHIRRED EGGS. 

For each earthenware shirrer take about three tablespoon fuls of fine 
bread crumbs from the center of a sHce or loaf and an equal quantity of 
fine-chopped cooked chicken or ham. Add a few grains of salt and cream or 
broth to make a thin batter. Butter a shirrer dish, put in a little of the 
batter, break in an tgg, and cover it with the rest of the batter. Let cook 
in a moderate oven until the tgg is set. Serve in the shirrers. For a change 
prepare about half the quantity of "batter," put this in the shirrers, break 
in the eggs, then cook until set. Take from the oven, and finish by disposing 
a tablespoonful of hot white or tomato sauce above the tgg. This, though 
it requires a little more work, is preferable. 

RAMEKINS OF EGGS WITH SWEETBREADS OR CHICKEN. 

This dish may be prepared from left-over bits of chicken or from the 
trimmings of sweetbreads purchased for another dish. Cut the chicken or 
sweetbreads into small cubes. Make a cup of sauce of two tablespoonfuls, 
each, of butter and flour, one-fourth teaspoonful, each, of salt and pepper, 
and a cup of rich milk or thin cream, or half cream and half stock. Stir the 
prepared cubes into half of the sauce, and put this in the bottom of three 
or four buttered ramekins ; break an tgg into each ramekin over the mixture, 
and set the ramekins into the oven on several folds of paiper and surrounded 
with hot water, until the eggs are "set;" put the rest of the sauce — kept hot 
for the purpose — over the eggs, cover the dishes, and send them at once to 
the table. Celery, cut in half-inch pieces, peas, or asparagus tips, all well 
cooked, or pieces of cooked oysters, lobster or shrimps may take the place 
of the chicken, or sweetbreads. 

RAMEKINS OF EGGS WITH TOMATO SAUCE. 

Melt three tablespoonfuls of butter; cook in this two slices of onion, a 
sprig of parsley and a piece of green pepper pod. When browned slightly, 
add two tablespoonfuls of flour and cook until frothy; then add a cup of 
cooked tomatoes; stir until boiling, then strain. Put one or two tablespoon- 
fuls of sauce in each ramekin, and break an tgg over the sauce; let cook in 
the oven about six minutes, or until the tgg is set ; put a little of the tomato 
sauce, kept hot for the purpose, over the tgg and send at once to the table. 



486p CASSEROLE COOKING 

BAKED EGGS. 

Butter an earthenware baking dish (casserole), break as raany eggs as 
will be needed into a saucer, one by one, and if found good, slip each into the 
baking dish. No broken yolk must be allowed nor must they crowd so as 
to risk breaking the yolk after put in. Put a small piece of butter on each 
and sprinkle with pepper and salt. Set into a well-heated oven and bake till 
the whites are set. If the oven is rightly heated it will take but a few min- 
utes and the cooking will be far more delicate than fried eggs. 

OYSTERS CODDLED IN RAMEKINS. 

From slices of bread half an inch thick stamp out pieces of bread the 
size of the ramekins; toast and butter them and set one in each ramekin; 
above these dispose a layer of oysters carefully washed and freed from bits 
of shell; sprinkle the oysters with salt and pepper, and pour over them two 
tablespoonfuls of cream sauce (see creamed oysters) made with milk or 
cream. Sprinkle the contents of each dish with two tablespoonfuls of cracker 
crumbs, mixed with butter. Cook in the oven (not in a dish of hot water) 
about eight minutes, or until the crumbs are well browned and send at once 
to the table. 

BROWN FRICASSEE OF OYSTERS IN RAMEKINS. 

Melt one-fourth cup of butter; in this cook two slices of onion, a sprig 
or two of parsley, three slices of carrot, and one-fourth of a green pepper 
pod, cut in strips, until they are browned. In the meanwhile, scald one quart 
of oysters and drain them carefully. Cook one-third cup of flour in the 
butter with the vegetables, until it is well browned, then add one cup of 
oyster liquor and one-half cup of cream and stir constantly until the sauce 
thickens and boils, then strain over the drained oysters and let heat over 
boiling water. When ready to serve turn into the ramekins, made hot in the 
warming oven or hot water, and serve at once. Pass at the same time hot 
biscuits, rolls or puff-paste diamonds. This dish may be served in either 
covered or uncovered ramekins. 

OYSTERS SCALLOPED IN RAMEKINS. 

Stir half a cup of butter (generous if you like) into a cup, each, of 
grated bread crumbs (soft) and cracker crumbs. Have the oysters care- 
fully rinsed with water to remove bits of shell. Butter the ramekins, put 
in a layer of the buttered crumbs, then a layer of oysters and sprinkle them 
with salt and pepper, then add a sprinkling of buttered crumbs, a table- 
spoonful of oyster liquor or sherry wine, then a second layer of oysters; 



CASSEROLE COOKING 486q 

sprinkle with salt and pepper and cover with buttered crumbs. Bake about 
fifteen minutes, or until the crumbs are browned. Use uncovered ramekins. 

CREAMED OYSTERS IN RAMEKINS. 

Pour a cup of cold water over a quart of oysters, and look over and 
wash the oysters to remove shell or sand. Strain the liquor through two 
folds of cheesecloth, set it over the fire and heat to the boiling point; skim, 
then add the oysters and heat these as quickly as possible to the boiling point ; 
drain the oysters and leave them whole or cut them in halves. Melt three 
tablespoonfuls of butter; in this cook three tablespoonfuls of flour, half a 
teaspoonful of salt, and a dash of pepper, then add a cup of the broth and 
half a cup of rich cr^am, or in place of these one cup and a half of rich milk ; 
stir until boiling, then add the oysters and let become very hot. Serve in 
covered ramekins, made hot by rinsing them in hot water. Serve with these 
olives or pickles, baking powder biscuits or yeast rolls. 

HARD EGGS A LA DREUX IN RAMEKINS. 

Prepare a pint of cream sauce and four "hard-boiled" eggs. Peel one- 
fourth of a pound of mushroom caps, and cut or break them into small 
pieces; let cook in three tablespoonfuls of hot butter till the butter is 
absorbed, then pour on the cream sauce and let cook over hot water fifteen 
minutes; add half a cup of cooked ham, cut in small cubes, and the cooked 
eggs, cut in slices; mix and turn into buttered ramekins, cover with a cup 
of cracker crumbs, mixed with one-third cup of melted butter and let stand 
in a hot oven to brown the crumbs.

LOBSTER NEWBURG IN RAMEKINS. 

Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter in a frying pan and stir into it a 
pint of lobster meat cut in small pieces, shaking in a little salt and a dash of 
paprika ; cover the dish and let stand for three or four minutes, then add one- 
fourth cup of sherry or madeira and mix thoroughly. Lastly, stir in the 
beaten yolks of three eggs, mixed with half a cup of cream; stir and cook 
(without boiling) until the mixture becomes very hot and slightly thickened, 
then turn into hot ramekins, cover closely and send at once to the table. 
Par-boiled oysters or clams, cooked chicken, finnan haddie, lobster, shrimps 
and sweetbreads may be prepared by the same recipe.

CHICKEN BECHAMEL IN RAMEKINS. 

Melt two tablespoon fuls butter; cook in this two tablespoon fuls flour, 
half a teaspoonful of salt and a dash of pepper, then stir in three-fourths cup, 
each, of chicken broth and milk or cream ; stir until boiling, then add a table- 
spoonful of fine-chopped parsley, about ten drops of onion juice, a pint of 
cooked chicken, chopped fine, and the beaten yolks of four eggs; turn the 
mixture into buttered ramekins and make the top of the mixture smooth. 
Set the ramekins on many folds of paper in an agate dish, surrounded with 
boiling water to half their height and let cook in a moderate oven about 
twenty minutes, or until the mixture feels firm. If uncovered ramekins be 
used, when sending to the table, set a sprig of parsley in the top of each. 
Mushrooms or sweetbreads may be mixed with the chicken; or fish, oysters, 
lobster, shrimps, sweetbreads and mushrooms may be used in place of the 
chicken. 

TURBANS OF FISH IN RAMEKINS. 

For eight ramekins have two small slices of halibut cut entirely across 
the fish; remove the skin and bone, thus securing eight "fillets" of the same 
shape and size. Trim these, if when rolled they will be too large for the 
ramekins. Dip the fillets in melted butter; squeeze over them the juice of 
half a lemon and a little onion juice and sprinkle with a little salt. Commen- 
cing at the widest end, roll each fillet into a "turban" and push a wooden 
toothpick, dipped in melted butter, through the turban, to hold it in shape. 
Set the prepared turbans in an agate pan, pour in a little fish stock (made 
by simmering the bones and trimmings of the fish with a few slices, each, 
of carrot and onion in water to cover) and put a teaspoonful of butter on 
each. Cook in a moderate oven about fifteen minutes. Baste three or four 
times with the liquid in the pan. When the turbans are cooked drain off 
the liquid and add to it enough cream or milk to make a cup and a half in 
all. Melt three tablespoonfuls of butter; cook in it three tablespoonfuls of 
flour and one-fourth teaspoonful, each, of salt and pepper; add the liquid 
and stir until boiling. Set the turbans in the ramekins, pour sauce over and 
around them, cover and serve at once.

Make a paste of powdered soapstone and benzine, spread it thickly 
ever the marble and leave it on over night, keeping it well covered to pre- 
vent evaporation, wash off with clear water, if the stains are not removed 
repeat the process. Whiting is sometimes used in place of the soap- 
stone. Prof. D. 

TO RESTORE GILT FRAMES. 

Take a soft brush and carefully free the frames of every particle of 
dust, then cover with the following mixture: The white of one egg and 
one-half ounce of chloride of potassa. Apply with a soft brush. 

The Scientific American says if you desire to cleanse gilt frames with' 
out tarnishing them, wash them in beer. G. T. H. 

TO WASH FEATHER PILLOWS. 

Choose a bright, windy day; fill the wash tub with hot suds and 
plunge the pillows (with feathers) in them. Put them through several 
waters, shaking them about briskly, then hang on the line in the open air. 
When perfectly dry shake well. They will be light, fresh and sweet. 
After they have been washed in this way, they ought to be hung out in 
the warm, fresh air every day for a week, but they must never be put 
directly in the hot sun, as the heat draws the oil out of the feathers and 
gives them an unpleasant odor. Jacks. 

TO POLISH HARDWOOD FLOORS. 

Take one or two pounds of spermaceti to every gallon of turpentine. 
Melt the spermaceti, then gradually add the turpentine. Polish tioors 
with this about every four weeks, after they are thoroughly cleaned. 
This is an excellent polish to remove all stickiness in corners and crevices 
caused by the use of wax, etc.; best applied warm. Peter Fox.

TO POLISH GLASS. 

For glassware, mirrors, etc., mix calcine magnesia with enough 
gasoline to make a liquid the consistency of cream. This will polish glass 
to perfection. Jay Bogart. 

POLISH FOR SILVER AND NICKEL=PLATED WARE. 

One-half ounce of fine crocus martis two ounces of fossil silica, one-

polish dry with whiting. R. N. F. 

TO POLISH TIN. 

All kitchen utensils should undergo an extra cleaning once or twice a 
year. This is quickly and easily done by plunging them into a boiler of 
strong soda water and letting them boil until all spots and blemishes are 
easily removed; then polish with one part of oxide of tin and three parts 
of whiting. Mix well, rub with the powder. A. U.

TO RUB UP WOODWORK. 

The oak and hard woods so much used in furniture often take on a 
dark, stained appearance. A fine cleanser is made by adding one-half 
pint of boiled oil to one-half pint of turpentine. This will remove all dirt, 
but will not polish. Mrs. Samantha Kinsley. 

TO CLEAN BLACK KID GLOVES. 

A good way to clean black kid gloves is to take a teaspoonful of salad

it dry, fold it nicely and press. Black crepe can also be perfectly restored 
by holding it over the steam of a boiling kettle. H. R. 

INDELIBLE INK— HOW TO HAKE. 

An ink that will prove indelible for marking clothes is made of four

INDELIBLE INK- No. a. 

One-half ounce of nitrate of silver, three ounces of water, one-half 

ounce of gum-arabic; dissolve and keep in a dark bottle. Write on the 

clothes to be marked with a goose quill or a gold pen. This ink will ruin 

steel pens. H. I. E. 

TO WASH CORSETS. 

To keep a pair of corsets perfectly fresh and clean they should be 
washed every two or three weeks. The operation is simple and will not 
injure the shape or cut. Make warm suds into which a few drops of 
ammonia have been put. Spread the corset on a flat table, taking out the 
laces, but not the bones and steels. Scrub it with a clean brush and the 
hot suds, then rinse quickly in clear, warm water. Lay flat on a board 
in the sun or near the fire so that it may dry quickly. Do not iron. L I. 

TO CLEAN FELT HATS. 

Remove hatband and place hat to be cleaned on a table. Moisten a

VARNISHING PLASTER CASTS. 

The little plaster of Paris statuettes one sees in so many homes can 
be kept fresh and clean by taking one-half ounce each of white soap and 
wax, two pints of water. Boil them together for about five minutes in a 
clean vessel. This forms a firm varnish, which should be applied to the 
figures with a soft brush when cold. It dries very readily and may be 
washed with fine soap. T. U. 

TO JAPAN OLD TEA TRAYS. 

First clean them thoroughly with soap and water and a little rotten- 
stone; then dry them by wiping and exposing to the fire. Now get some 
good copal varnish, mix it with bronze powder and apply with a brush to 
the denuded parts. After which set the tray in an oven at a heat of from 
212 to 300 degrees until the varnish is dry. Two coats will make it equal 
to new. Mrs. Lilly. 

TO REGULATE THE CLOCK. 

When the clock refuses to go, try the following, before taking it to 
the repair shop: Take off the pointers and the face; take off the pendu- 
lum and its wire. Remove the ratchet from the "tick" wheel, and the 
clock will run down with great velocity. Let it go; the increasing speed 
wears away the gum and dust from the pinions — the clock cleans itself. 
If you have any sperm oil, put the least bit on the axles. Put the 
machine together, and nine times in ten it will run just as well as if it had 
been taken to the shop. In fact, this is the way most shopmen clean 
clocks. If instead of a pendulum, the clock has a watch escapement, this 
latter can be taken out in an instant, without taking the works apart, and 
the result is the same. It takes about twenty minutes to so clean a clock, 
and saves a dollar. Zeb B. 

AQUARIUn CEMENT. 

Take equal parts of very clean, sharp sand, plaster of Paris, and

The Dairy. 



As the subject of cheese is discussed by itself we will here only speak 
briefly of butter. Butter making is a thing so generally understood 
by all who keep cows that only a word here is needed. The first great 
requisite of good butter is cleanliness. One cannot be too careful in see- 



MISCELLANEOUS. 499 

ing that the dairy, cellar, or the room in which the milk is set to nse, has 
an abundance of fresh air and is thoroujifhly clean and sweet. Decayed 
vegetables, or rank odors of any and every sort should be eliminated; 
the milk pans (or cans which arc now much used) should be thoroughly 
scalded and dried in the sun or in the heater and then placed in the open 
air. The cream should be skimmed at the proper time and the churning 
should be done before the cream gets old. In skimming cream into the 
cream jars it should all be stirred up each time so that it becomes uni- 
form and all sours alike. S. H. 

TO MAKE BUTTER. 

In order to churn quickly the cream should be from 50° to 58° Fahr. 
In winter the cream can be set for an hour in a warm room to bring it to 
the proper degree of heat or warm water can be added to it after it has 
been placed in the churn. In the summer time it should be placed in ice- 
water or in a cellar. 

Before putting cream in the churn scald churn well with hot water, 
then with cold, but do not wipe. Put in cream and churn evenly and 
quite rapidly at first slowing dov/n as the butter begins to appear. After 
butter collects take it up in a wooden bowl with wooden ladle both of 
which must be scalded and then rinsed in cold water. Do not wash but- 
ter as that destroys some of its flavor. Add fine salt in proportion of two 
even teaspoonfuls to a pound, let get cold and then work the buttermilk 
out. Pack in jars or make in balls, W. H. KaDell. 

BRINE TO BRESERVE BUTTER. 

Make a brine of sail strong enough to bear up an egg; add a little 
white sugar and a speck of saltpetre; boil the brine and when cold strain. 
Pour it over the butter so as to cover. This excludes the air. Place a 
weight over; plain salt and water brine is quite as good if preferred. 

HOMEKEEPER. 

Dyeing' and Coloring'. 

An article intended for dyeing must be clean, else it will not take 
the dye satisfactorily. First scour your goods thoroughly with soap 
and rinse the soap out well. When ready to color the goods, dip them in 
cold water, so that they will not spot. When they are dyed, air them. 
Rinse well after that and hang them up to dry. Silks and merinos must 
not be wrung. Cotton goods must be bleached or faded before dyeing, if 
a light color is desired. 



500 MISCELLANEOUS. 

There are a set of "Family Dyes" on the market, which are giving 
entire satisfaction, and which are simple to use, as the directions accom- 
pany them. There is no need to experiment as to the color you desire, as 
a color card goes with them. These dyes are cheap, and are the experi- 
ences of professional dyers. They can be obtained at any drug store. 

WALNUT BARK AS A DYE. 

Walnut bark will color any shade from a light tan to coal-black. 
Color the wool before carding, as follows: Peel the bark from the body of 
the tree (the bark off the roots is best). Put into a barrel a layer of bark 
and wool alternately, till you fill the barrel, then fill up the barrel with 
rain water. Lay on the top heavy weights. Let it stand in the sun or 
some warm place till you get the shade required. A. H. C. 

BUTTERNUT BARK AS A DYE. 

Another way to color yarn, cloth or carpet rags is to boil a large iron 
kettle full of butternut bark four hours; take out the bark, put in a spoon- 
ful of copperas. If you wish a black put in more copperas or a little blue 
vitriol ( too much vitriol rots the goods). Then while the dye is boiling, 
put in the goods and keep stirring and once every few minutes lift the 
goods with a stick into the air, then put them under. And keep watching 
and moving them until you obtain the desired shade. Do not fold or 
pack them too tight, or they will spot. Sarah A. Bixby. 

TO COLOR 5ILK LILAC. 

For three pounds of silk take five and one-quarter pounds of archil. 
Mix well with the liquor, letting it boil fifteen minutes. When you dip 
the silk do so quickly, then let it cool and wash it in soft water, and a very 
pretty violet will be the result. J. F. G. 

TO COLOR WOOL SCARLET. 

One ounce of cream of tartar, one ounce of cochineal well powdered, 
five ounces of muriate of tin. This will do two pounds of goods. Boil 
the dye and put in the goods. Work briskly for fifteen minutes, then boil 
one and one-half hours, moving the goods about while boiling. Wash in 
cold water and dry in a shady place. M. H, 

TO COLOR WOOL BLUE. 

Use three ounces of cream of tartar and five ounces of alum. Boil 
two pounds of goods in this one hour, then place them in warm water

in hot suds, not quite boiling, but near it and soak the goods till of the 
right color. Rinse in alum water. T. C. 

TO COLOR SILK GREEN. 

Take equal quantities of yellow oak and hickory bark. Make a strong

SALJyiON COLOR. 

Take to each pound of goods one-quarter of a pound of annotto, and 
one-quarter of a pound of soap. Rinse goods in warm water, then boil 
them in the mixture one-half hour. The depth of shade is determined by 
the amount of annotto. F. D. C. 

TO COLOR COTTON SKY BLUE. 

Four ounces of vitriol (blue) to each three pounds of goods. Boil it a 
few moments, then dip the goods three hours. Pass them through a 
strong lime water. If they are then put through a solution of prussiate of 
potash a beautiful brown will result. S. A. B. 

TO COLOR COTTON YELLOW. 

Take one-half pound of sugar of lead and dissolve it in hot water. 
Dissolve one-eighth of a pound of bichromate of potash. Dip first in the 
lead, then in the potash till it is as bright a yellow as you want it. This 
amount is enough for three pounds of goods, To make them bright 
orange, dip according to above dye, and then dip in very strong boiling 
alum water. Wring out, and dip in clear, hot rain water. S. A. B. 

TO COLOR BROWN. 

Take one pound of catechu extract and one-half ounce of vitriol; dis- 
solve in rain water; in the catechu put water enough to wet your goods. 
Color in an iron kettle. Then put in your vitriol. Wet goods in soap- 
suds before putting in the dye. This is a fast color. Mrs. A. S.

thirty minutes, then take out and air. Put six ounces of prussiate of pot- 
ash in clean water in the kettle. Let the goods stand in this for thirty 
minutes more, remove and add two ounces of oil of vitriol. Put the 
goods back twenty minutes longer, if a dark blue is desired. Mrs. H. 

TO BLEACH QOODS. 

There should be no grease in articles that are to be put through the 
dyeing process. It is necessary, often, to get rid of all the color in a piece 
of goods. This can be done by boiling in strong soapsuds till faded but 
be particular to rinse out all the soap. F. A. Evans. 

BLACK FOR COTTON AND WOOLEN QOODS. 

A black that will neither stain nor fade is made of two ounces of extract 
of logwood, one-half ounce of sugar of lead and one ounce of blue vitriol. 
Dissolve the vitriol and logwood in two separate waters. Wash the 
goods in warm water and place them in the vitriol water. Put the lead 
into the logwood water, and as soon as hot take the goods from the vitriol 
water and submerge in the dye, stirring them well for one-half hour. 
Make a strong brine of salt and take out the goods from the dye, put 
them into a tub and pour the salt water over them. Let stand till cold, 
hang up, let dry, and rinse in clear warm water. W. L. 

TO COLOR WOOL QOODS QREEN. 

Wool goods will take a handsome green by taking one-half pound of 
fustic with one and three-quarter ounces of alum. Steep until strength is 
all out and soak the goods in this till a good yellow is had. Then take 
out the chips and add one tablespoonful of extract of indigo, till the color 
is bright enough. Miss Johnson. 

TO COLOR SILK CRIMSON. 

Three ounces of alum are required for each pound of goods. Heat 
and dip at hand heat, for one hour. Take out and drain, making a dye 
of three ounces of cochineal, one-quarter of an ounce of cream of tartar^ 
two ounces of bruised nutgalls in a pail of water and boiling it ten min- 
utes. When a little cool, dip, raising the heat to a boil. Dip one hour, 
then wash and dry. C. D.

pounds of goods in this dye for two hours. Mrs. D. 

TO COLOR WOOL GOODS BLACK. 

To five pounds of goods take six ounces of blue'vitriol; boil the vitriol 
five minutes, then dip the goods for three-quarters of an hour, airing it 
now and then. Make a dye with three pounds of logwood and boil one- 
half hour. Dip three-quarters of an hour, air the goods and dip the same 
length of time again. Then wash in strong suds. J. E. 

TO DYE FURS. 

It is difficult to dye furs. Take one-half gallon of lye, adding one 
quart of soft water. Heat it in an iron kettle. Take one-half ounce of 
acetate of lead, one-half ounce of sulphate of iron and three ounces of 
litharge. Powder the ingredients and dissolve one at a time in the lye. 
As soon as the liquid is of a blood heat put the furs in for a few moments 
only. Air them and dip them in strong vinegar, then smooth them and 
hang up to dry. You can make the dye stronger if the color does not 
take very well. N^ p^

THE VARIED USES OF LEMON. 

Every toilet table should be liberally supplied with lemons. Their 
uses are so varied and so valuable that no one can overlook them. Among 



MISCELLANEOUS, 505 

them is the fact that a teaspoonful of lemon juice in a cupful of black 
coffee will drive away the headache. But if, on rising, the juice of one- 
half of a lemon be squeezed into a cupful of very hot water and drank 
with no sugar there will be no headache to drive away. A slice of lemon 
rubbed on the temples and back of the neck will also cure the headache. 
A solution of lemon juice should always be at hand. A little rubbed on 
the skin at night will whiten and soften its texture. A paste made of mag- 
nesia and lemon juice will bleach the face and hands when applied to 
them. A fine manicure acid is made from a teaspoonful of lemon juice in 
a cupful of warm soft water. It will whiten discolored and stained fingei 
nails. Lemon juice in water will loosen the tartar that accumulates on 
the teeth. It makes the breath sweet. A slice of lemon rubbed over tan 
shoes which are then wiped off with a soft cloth will remove black stains 
from their surface, Bessie Hill Porter. " 

FOR THE TOILET TABLE. 

A nice hair pin receiver may be made from a round collar or cuff box. 
The cover is not used. Cover the bottom and sides neatly with some 
merino or anything convenient, the color of the worsted to be used, scar- 
let being the most serviceable. Crochet in split zephyr, a strip to cover 
the sides and sew it on. Fill the box with black curled hair, such as 
upholsterers use. Crochet a circular piece for the top in the open-stitch, 
finished with shells, tacking it on the covered edge of the box just inside 
the shells. It is not a thing of beauty but is so convenient and easily 
made that it becomes quite necessary, Mrs. Olive Green. 

THE ORCHID FAD. 

If there is anything new in toilet preparations the distinction belongs 
to the orchid. It may be a surprise to many to be told that that weird 
flower has a scent but there is no doubt about the article of commerce. 
Dealers charge $2 and $3 a bottle for four ounces of orchid extracts. 
The odor is delicate, pleasing and lasting. There is orchid powder and 
cream for the face, orchid paste for the hands and orchid vinegar for the 
bath. The powders are made in pink, cream, mauve and aster tints. 



Sick and Convalescent 

NURSING the sick is a duty that requires intelligence and patience. 
Few sick persons retain the cheerfulness that characterized them 
while well, and in dealing with their little whims, the tenderest forbear- 
ance should be exercised. Affection softens the touch and makes unpala- 
table potions endurable. In a sick room a clean and wholesome dress is 
ever called into use. Perfect cleanliness of hands and nails is imperative. 
A cheerful spirit is the best medicine of all. 

Never ask a patient what he would like to eat, but surprise him or her 
with something delicately prepared, for one who is really sick never has 
an appetite and has no choice. Permit little or no company in the sick 
room. Caution is to be observed regarding remarks about the sick in 
their presence. Have the room well ventilated from the top, but avoid 
draughts or a cold room. These few hints are not given for professional 
nurses, but to aid a family to take charge of their own sick, sensibly and 
conscientiously. Prof. R. 

PREPARATION OF FOOD FOR THE SICK AND CONVALESCENT. 

It is extremely difficult to know exactly what diet to give to sick per- 
sons; very often a slight error in diet will bring on a fatal result. 

When any article of food causes increased action of the heart, quick- 
ness of the pulse, headache, or pains in the stomach or bowels, it is then 
an indication that such food is injurious. The patient should not be urged 
to eat; he is better able to tell what he wishes than any one else. If he 
craves for any particular thing, as a general thing it will do him good. 

When the patient is recovering from disease, but is still weak, though 
gradually regaining strength, strict attention should be given to the diet. 
In regard to the kinds of food which may be allowed, it should be remem- 
bered that first of all, it must be light and nutritious. Milk is probably as 
easy of digestion as any other substance; it may be given at all times 
during the sickness and convalescence without injury; it should, however, 
not be used except when drawn immediately from the cow. After the 
cream has formed, it is indigestible. Eggs broken in hot water and 
slightly cooked may also be allowed. Boiled rice is easy of digestion, and 
beef tea, mutton broth and chicken are useful in convalescence. Fruits

SICK AND CONVALESCENT, 5©7 

are sometimes very beneficial, and at other times very hurtful. In fever, 
the juice of ripe oranges will be extremely grateful; the pulpy part should 
be rejected. Grapes may also be allowed, being careful not to swallow 
the seeds or skin. Lemon juice, lemonade, strawberries which have their 
juice bruised out and strained, may also be allowed. Hot water poured 
upon bruised tamarinds, peaches, etc., and allowed to stand until cold, will 
be beneficial. Toast water may be used as a drink. Cold water may be 
taken at all times with benefit, if it causes no distressing symptoms. Rice 
water, barley water and apple water are all good drinks. Boiled fish is 
generally easy of digestion, as well as oyster broth. As a general rule, 
all shell fish should be forbidden. Vegetables, such as boiled potatoes, 
boiled beets, and boiled onions, may be eaten without harm; they should, 
however, be boiled in two waters until quite soft. Prof. R. 

TO HAKE GRUEL. 

The following is an excellent recipe: Pour one quart of hot water into 
a clean earthen or tin vessel over a brisk fire; when it boils, add two large 
tablespoonfuls of corn or oatmeal; mix it smooth in just water enough to 
thicken it; put a small lump of butter into the water and when melted, 
add the meal and stir for about one-half hour; then add a teacupful of 
sweet milk, and when it boils again throw in the upper crust of hard- 
baked bread cut into small pieces; let it boil some time and add a little 
black pepper, a little salt, a pinch of grated nutmeg, a little more butter 
and a teaspoonful of French brandy. The butter, spices and brandy 
should be omitted when the case is a serious one. Nurse. 

BEEF TEA. 

Take one pound of lean beef, cut it fine, put it in a bottle corked 
tightly, and put the bottle into a kettle of warm water; the water should 
be allowed to boil for a considerable time; the bottle should then be 
removed and the contents poured out. The tea may be salted a little and 
a teaspoonful given each time. Another way of preparing it is as follows: 
Take a thick steak, broil slightly on a gridiron until the juices have 
started, and then squeeze thoroughly with a lemon squeezer. The juice 
thus extracted will be highly nutritious. M. S. 

TOAST WATER. 

Toast slightly a piece of bread, and add to it boiling water; if pre 
ferred, sweeten. It may be flavored with lemon or orange peel. R. DeL.

FLAXSEED TEA. 

Take one ounce of flaxseed and a little pounded licorice root and pour 
on a pint of boiling water; place the vessel near a fire for four hours; 
strain through a linen or cotton cloth. P. T. 

BARLEY COFFEE. 

Roast barley until well brown and boil a tablespoonful of it in a pint 

of water for five minutes; strain and add a little sugar, if desired. A 

nourishing drink toward the close of fever and during convalescence. 

M. H. O. 
OATMEAL COFFEE. 

Mix common oatmeal and water to form cake; bake and brown it, 
powder it, and boil in water five minutes. Good for checking obstinate 
vomiting, especially in cholera morbus. J. Pollock. 

CRACKED OR ROLLED WHEAT. 

In two quarts of boiling water, stir one pint of cracked wheat. One- 
half teaspoonful of salt. Use a farina boiler or double kettle, and cook 
three hours without stirring. When done, mold in dishes. Eat hot or 
cold with fruit sauce, or cream and sugar. Excellent in constipation or 
biliousness. The rolled wheat is preferable. Not being able to procure 
it ready prepared one can crack wheat in an ordinary coffee mill. J. I. 

OATMEAL MUSH. 

Coarse oatmeal should also be cooked like rolled wheat. If 
desired warm for breakfast, can be left in a granite or porcelain farina 
boiler over night, and heated in a few minutes. Do not soak oatmeal 
over night, nor try to cook it suf^ciently in the morning. It must never 
be stirred while cooking. Fine oatmeal can be made in a mush like 
Indian meal and be ready for the table in twenty minutes. T. T. 

INDIAN MEAL flUSH. 

Take fine meal of Northern corn and a little salt; stir slowly in boiling 
water until it .s as thick as can be stirred easily. Stand it on back of the 
stove and cook slowly one hour. Is better cooked in a milk boiler. 1. 1

palatable by the addition of any acid jelly. A Nurse. 

BROILED TENDERLOIN, CHICKEN, OR nUTTON CHOP. 

This is enjoyed when the patient is becoming? convalescent. Cut out 
the round piece from the inside of a sirloin steak, boil it quickly over a 
bright fire, turn it, with its gravy, upon a piece of freshly-made toast, 
sprinkle with salt and pepper, but no butter; place between two hot 
plates and serve directly. A tender mutton chop, or one-half of the 
breast of a chicken can be served the same way, but the chicken will 
require longer and somewhat slower cooking. Mary Parry. • 

CHICKEN PANADA. 

Rub together in a mortar the meat from the breast of a cold chicken 
with stale bread, one-half of each, then add slowly the water in which the 
chicken was boiled, or some nice broth, entirely free from fat. Boil for a 
few moments and pass the whole through a fine sieve. Mrs. H. P. 

BEEF JELLY.

STERILIZED LEMONADE. 

Squeeze the juice out of a lemon. Strain it, put it with one-quarter of 
the rind and four lumps of loaf sugar into a pitcher and pour over it one 
pint of boiling water. Cover close and let it stand two hours. Then 
strain and it will be ready for use. Lemonade for the sick should be 
made with boiling water as the unhealthy properties of the lemon are 
thus destroyed. A small quantity only of sugar should be put in as the 
acidity will most likely be agreeable. Health School.

NUTTA. 

This is a combination of nuts and cereals, and is a peculiarly 
strengthening food for invalids. It can be eaten dry, or served with milk. 
Found in all groceries. Sanitarium. 

HALTED niLK. 

The name of this preparation indicates its character. It is made of 
the best nuts, and is soluble in hot or cold water, when it forms a rich, 
cream resembling malted milk, but finer in flavor. Suitable for the 
feeble. Sanitarium. 

TAPIOCA CUP PUDDING. 

This is very light and delicate for invalids. Take an even table- 
spoonful of tapioca and soak for two hours in a cupful of new milk. Stir 
in the yolk of a fresh ^^%, a little sugar, a grain of salt and bake in a cup 
for fifteen minutes. A little jelly may be eaten with it, if allowed, or a 
few fresh strawberries. Mrs. C. M. Johnson. 

HEALTH DRINK. 

A cooling drink for a sick person is made by boiling one and one-half 
ounces of tamarinds, three ounces of cranberries and two ounces of stoned 
raisins, in three pints of water, till the water is reduced to two pints. 
Strain and add 2. bit of lemon peel, which must be removed in an hour, as 
it gives a bitter taste if left too long. F. T. J. 

BOILED PARTRIDGES. 

Partridges are very delicate and tender for sick or old people, when 
boiled. Wash them well, truss them and put into boiling water, sprinkle a 
teaspoonful of salt over and simmer them very gently for one-quarter of 
an hour, or if the birds a-.3 old, twenty minutes. Serve with sliced lemon 
round the dish, and with white sauce, celery sauce, or bread sauce, accom- 
panied by game gravy. M. A. Wells. 

MIXED BEEF TEA.

milk and water for one-half hour. Let it boil, then simmer gently until it 
is quite clear, and stir frequently to keep it from getting into lumps. 
Sweeten it slightly and flavor with wine if agreeable, if not, with cinna- 
mon. If it is too thick, add a little more water. Veal, mutton or chicken 
broth may be substituted for the water. Mrs. L. A. Mendum. 

ORANGE AND LEMON JUICE. 

A fine preparation for an invalid is made of orange or lemon juice, 
strained and boiled with an equal weight of loaf sugar and then bottled 
and corked closely. It is an agreeable and valuable addition to gruel and 
other warm drinks. It takes fifteen minutes to boil. A dessert-spoonful 
of lemon juice must be added to one-half of a pint of gruel.

CELERY FOR RHEUMATISM. 

Celery has medicinal qualities above the average. It should be used 
extensively by people suffering from rheumatism and nervous diseases. 

AN INVALID'S DINNER. 

Select a good chop from a loin of mutton and trim all the fat from the 
meat and put it in a covered jar (a salt jar does very well for the purpose) 
with three tablespoonfuls of water; stand it in a moderately hot oven, 
steam it one-half hour, and a few minutes before serving add a pinch of 
salt. Serve very hot, with the gravy poured over it. Steak or chops 
cooked in this manner are very tender and easily digested by the weak 
and delicate. Bertha R. 

FIBERLESS BEEF FOR INVALID3. 

For those who are fond of beef steak and whose stomach will not per- 
mit of the regular broiled steak try the following method of cooking it. 
Take one pound of fresh juicy round steak and with a dull knife scrape 
out the beef, leaving the fiber by itself until all the meat has been scraped 
out. Now put just a trifle of butter in the botL^m of a frying-pan, let it 
get hot and put in the scraped meat. Turn two or three times, salt 
slightly and serve hot. It is delicious. Dr. Rockwell.

BALTIMORE PUNCH. 

One quart of Jamaica rum, one quart of brandy, one quart of port, 
one-half pint of Curacoa, three cupfuls of white sugar, one dozen lemons, 
one quart of strong black tea. To mix: To the tea while hot, add the 
sugar and lemon juice; mix thoroughly and strain through cotton cloth. 
When cool add the brandy, rum and Curacoa. If to keep awhile, bottle 
and seal it. To Serve: Over a clear and clean cake of ice in the punch 
bowl place your stock, adding three pint bottles of soda (aerated water) 
to each quart bottle of stock. Stir gently and serve at once. The ice 
maybe put outside the bowl; it keeps the strength of the punch much 
steadier. The tea should not draw long enough to become bitter. A bot- 
tle of champagne with each three bottles of soda, or in place of them, 
enlivens the punch. Mrs. T. R. Smith. 

A LIGHT CUSTARD. 

Break one egg into a teacup, beat it up and sweeten as liked. Add 
milk to fill the cup, mix once more, and tie a piece of linen over it. Set it 
into a shallow pan one-half full of water, and boil ten minutes. J. D. T. 

APPLE WATER. 

Roast two tart apples until they are soft; put them in a pitcher, pour 
upon them a pint of cold water and let it stand in a cool place for one 
hour. It is used in fevers and eruptive diseases, and does not require 
sweetening. Rush Medical College. 

SAGO GRUEL. 

Take two tablespoonfuls of sago and add one pint of water. Boil till 

it thickens, stirring frequently. Wine, sugar and nutmeg may be added.

SAGE TEA. 

One-half ounce of dried leaves of sage, one quart of boiling water. 
Infuse for one-half hour and strain. Add sugar and lemon juice «s 
required by the patient. The above is an agreeable and useful drink in 
fevers and its diaphoretic powers may be increased by adding a little sweet 
spirits of nitre. Eliza Locke. 

THICKENED MILK. 

With a little milk, mix a smooth tablespoonful of flour and a pinch 
of salt. Pour upon it a quart of boiling milk and when it is thoroughly 
mixed put all back into the saucepan and boil up once, being careful not 
to burn and stirring all the time, to keep it perfectly smooth and free

water and boil twenty minutes. Add two cupfuls of milk and a little salt 
and cook ten minutes more, stirring often. Eat with sugar and milk, while 
hot. A Nurse. 

STEWED PRUNES. 

These are good in measles, and scarlet fever, both as food and medi- 
cine. Get the box prunes as they are generally of a much better quality 
than the open sort. Soak them for one hour in cold water, then put them 
into a porcelain-lined saucepan, with a little more water if necessary, and 
a little sugar. Cover and let them stew slowly for one hour, or until they 
are swollen large and quite soft. They are excellent as an accompani- 
ment to breakfast for a sick person. Julia Tubes.

Ventildwtion — Sewerage — Drinking Water. 

Every woman should look well to the ventilation of the home; see 
that every chimney is unstopped and during the daytime that every win- 
dow in every unoccupied room is thrown open. 

My firm belief is, that if more attention were paid to thorough venti- 
lation fevers would be an almost unknown disease. The cooping-up sys- 
tem is abominable; it engenders all manner of infectious and loathsome 
diseases, and not only engenders them, but feeds them, and thus keeps 
them alive. There is nothing wonderful in all this, if we consider, but for 
one moment, that the exhalations from the lungs are poisonous. The 
lungs give off carbonic acid gas (a deadly poison), which, if it is not 
allowed to escape must be breathed over and over again. If the perspira- 
tion of the body (which in twenty-four hours amounts to two or three 
pounds!) is not permitted to escape from the apartment, it must become 
foetid — repugnant, sickening, and injurious to the health. The nose is a 
sentinel and often warns its owner of approaching danger! 

SLEEPING ROOMS. 

The bedroom ought, if practicable, to be large and airy. Particular 
attention must be paid to the ventilation. The door and the windows 
ought in the daytime to be thrown wide open, and the bedclothes should 
be thrown back, that the air might, before the approach of night, well 
ventilate them. Pure air and a frequent change of air is quite necessary. 

The bed must not be loaded with clothes, more especially with a thick 
coverlet. If the weather is cold, let an extra blanket be put on the bed, 
as the perspiration can permeate through a blanket when it cannot 
through a thick coverlet. The knitted, for the summer, are the best, as 
they allow the perspiration from the body to escape; and the eiderdown, 
for winter, are light, warm, and ventilating. 

It is a marvel how some people, with four or five blankets, and with a 
thick coverlet on the bed, can sleep at all; their skins and lungs are 
smothered, and are not allowed to breathe, for the skin is as much a 
breathing apparatus as are the lungs themselves, 

SEWERS. 

To destroy the smell is not to destroy the danger; certainly not! The 
right way to do away with the danger is to remove the cause, and the 
effect will cease. Flushing a sewer is far more efficacious than disin- 

33 



518 SICK AND CONVALESCENT. 

fecting one. Soap and water, the scrubbing brush, sunshine and thorough 
ventilation, each and all are far more beneficial than either permanganate 
of potash, chloride of zinc or chloride of lime. People in these times 
think too much of disinfectants, and too little of removal of causes; they 
think too much of artificial, and too little of natural means. 

Not only should the ventilation of the house be well looked after, 
but it ought to be ascertained that the drains are in good and perfect 
order, that the privies are frequently emptied of their contents, and that 
neither drain fluid nor privy fluid communicates, in any way whatever, 
with the supply of drinking water. Bad drainage and overflowing privies 
are fruitful sources of child-bed fever, gastric fever, scarlatina, diphtheria, 
cholera and a host of other infectious, contagious and dangerous diseases. 
It is an abominable practice to allow dirt to fester near human habita- 
tions. 

PURE WATER. 

Look well to the purity of the well water and ascertain that no drain 
either enters, percolates, or contaminates it in any way whatever. If it 
should do so, disease, such as cholera, diarrhea, dysentery, diphtheria, 
scarlet fever or gastric fever, will, as a matter of course, ensue. If there 
is the slightest danger or risk of drain contamination, whenever it is prac- 
ticable, let the drain be taken up and examined, and the defect carefully 
rectified. When It is Impracticable to have the drain taken up and exam- 
ined, then always boil the water before using. The boiling of water, as 
experience teaches, has the power either of destroying or making innocu- 
ous the specific organic faecal life poison, which propagates in drain con- 
tamination the diseases above enumerated. 

The water from the drive well is far superior to water from the old 
pump well; the water from the former is always pure, while from the 
latter it is usually most impure. 



INFANTS m 

HOW AND WHAT TO FEED THEM. 

IF IT is ascertained, past all doubt, that a mother cannot nurse her 
child, then a healthy wet nurse should be procured, as the food which 
nature has supplied is superior to any invented by art. Never bring up a 
baby, if you can possibly avoid it, on artificial food. It is impossible to 
imitate, perfectly, the admirable and subtle chemistry of nature. The 
law of nature is, that a babe, for the first few months of his existence, 
shall be brought up by the breast; and Nature's law.cannot be broken 
with impunity. In selecting a wet nurse, I would inquire particularly into 
the state of her health; whether she is of a healthy family, of consump- 
tive habits, or if she or any of her family have the scrofula, ascertaining 
if there are any seams or swellings about her neck; any eruptions or 
blotches upon her skin; if she has a plentiful breast of milk, and is of 
good quality; if she has good nipples, sufficiently long for the baby to hold, 
that they are not sore; and if her own child is of the same or nearly of 
the same age as the one you wish her to nurse. 

ARTIFICIAL niLK. 

There are cases where people object to a wet nurse and then fre- 
quently, too, none can be found. In that event the best food must be 
resorted to that can be found. 

Reason, as well as experience, abundantly proves that the object to 
be aimed at in hand-feeding is to imitate as nearly as possible the food 
which nature supplies for the new-born child, and therefore the obvious 
course is to use milk from some animal, so treated as to make it resemble 
human milk as nearly as it may be The following rule is considered 
about the best; 

Fresh milk from one cow; 

Warm water, of each one-quarter of a pmt 

Sugar-of-milk, one teaspoonful. 

The sugar-of-milk should first be dissolved m the warm water and 
then the fresh milk unboiled should be mixed with it. The sweetening of 
the above food with sugar-of-milk, instead of with lump sugar makes the 
food more resemble the mother's own milk 

519 



520 mPANTS-'HOW AND WHAT TO FEED THEM. 

Never give the child the white rubber nipple nursing bottle, since il 
contains in its composition the carbonate of lead, which is a slow poison. 
Black rubber is not objectionable. 

After a child begins teething any of the following foods may be given: 
The food that suits one infant, however, will not agree with another. 
The one that I have found the most useful is made as follows: Boil the 
crumb of bread for two hours in water, taking particular care that it does 
not burn, then add only a little loaf-sugar (or brown sugar, if the bowels 
are costive) to make it palatable. Mix a little new milk — the milk of one 
cow — with it, gradually, as it becomes older, increase the quantity until it 
is nearly all milk, there being only enough water to boil the bread; the 
milk should be poured boiling hot on the bread. Sometimes the two 
milks— the mother's and the cow's milk — do not agree; when" such is the 
case, let the milk be left out, both in this and in the foods following and 
make the food with water, instead of with milk and water. In other 
respects, until the child is weaned, make as above directed; when he is 
weaned, good fresh cow's milk must, as previously recommended, be used. 

THE NURSERY. 

The nursery ought to be the largest and most airy room in the. house. 
In town, if it is the top story (providing the apartment is large and airy) 
so much the better, as the air will then be purer. The architect, in the 
building of a house, ought to be particularly directed to pay attention to 
the space, the loftiness, the ventilation, the light, the warming, and the 
conveniences of a nursery. A bathroom attached to it will be of great 
importance and benefit to the health of a child, 

VENTILATION. 

The ventilation of a nursery is of paramount importance. There 
ought to be a constant supply of fresh pure air in the apartment. But 
how few nurseries have fresh, pure air? Many nurseries are nearly her- 
metically sealed — the windows are seldom, if ever, opened; the doors are 
religiously closed; and, in summer time, the chimneys are carefully stuffed 
up, so that a breath of air is not allowed to enter. The consequences are 
that the poor unfortunate children are poisoned by their own breaths, and 
are made so delicate that they are constantly catching cold; indeed, it 
may be said that they are laboring under chronic catarrhs, all arising from 
Nature's laws being set at defiance. 

A child ought not to be permitted to sit with his back to the fire; it

weakens the spine, and thus the whole frame; it causes a rush of blood to 
the head and face and predisposes him to colds. Pure air and pure 
water, let me add, pure milk, are the grand and principal requirements of 
health for a child. 

DRAINAGE. 

Look well to the drainage of the house and neighborhood. A child 
is very susceptible to the influence of bad drainage. Bad drains are fruit- 
ful sources of scarlet fever, diphtheria, diarrhea, etc. 

WALLS OF A NURSERY. 

Do not have the nursery wall covered with green paper hangings. 
Green paper hangings contain large quantities of arsenic— arsenite of 
copper — which is a virulent poison, and which flies about the room in the 
form of powder. There is another great objection to having your nursery 
walls covered with green paper hangings; if any of the paper should 
become loose from the walls a little child is very apt to play with it, and to 
put it, as he does everything else, into his mouth. 

MAKE A CHILD HAPPY. 

Let a child's home be the happiest house to him in the world; and to 
be happy he must be merry and cheerful; and he ought to have an abun- 
dance of playthings, to help on the merriment. If he has a dismal nurse, 
and a dismal home, he may as well be incarcerated in a prison, and be 
attended by a jailor. It is sad enough to see dismal, doleful men and 
women, but it is a truly lamentable and unnatural sight to see a doleful 
child. The young ought to be as playful and as full of innocent mischief 
as kittens. There will be quite time enough in after years for sorrow and 
for sadness. 

Bright colors, plenty of light, clean windows (mind this, if you please), 
an abundance of ^6'^^ colored prints, and toys without number, are the 
proper furnishings of a nursery. Nursery! why, the very name tells you 
what it ought to be — the home of childhood — the most important room in 
the house — a room that will greatly tend to stamp the character of your 
child for the remainder of his life.

REVALENT DISORDERS 
and THEIR REMEDIES 

SIMPLE REMEDY TO BREAK UP A HARD COLD. 

WHEN you feel a cold coming on drink four or five glasses of hot 
water (not warm water, but hot). In one-half hour drink foui more 
glasses of hot water. If the throat is sore, gargle it with warm water and 
alcohol, in the proportion of one teaspoonful of alcohol to one-half glass- 
ful of water. On going to bed, fill the bath-tub one-quarter full of hot 
water and sit in it eight minutes, keeping the water as hot as you can 
stand. If you do not have a bath-tub then put the feet for the same 
length of time into a foot-tub filled two-thirds full with hot water — take 
no medicine, but drink more hot water and go to bed. If the lungs are 
sore, put on a compress as follows: Dip a napkin in cold water, wring it 
out dry and lay it over the throat and chest. Over this spread two or 
three thicknesses of flannel, and with a long strip of cloth tie it on. Now 
forget your troubles and go to sleep. In the morning you will wonder 
what became of the cold. A Common Sense Mother. 

HICCOUGH CURE. 

(For a Grown Person.) 

To cure the hiccoughs of a grown person, one has sometimes to be a 
little more persevering. I knew a case where a patient recovering from 
typhoid fever had the hiccoughs two days, and the phj'sicians had tried 
every known remedy, but to no purpose, it was f hen that a very simple 
remedy was suggested by the wife of the patient which though at first 
ridiculed by the doctors, probably saved the man's life. The wife said to 
the doctors that her husband had asked several times for some hot coffee, 
and begged that she might be permitted to give him some. The doctors 
although they had previously refused, finally consented, saying, "give him 
only a little." The wife then went to the kitchen, with her own hands 
made some fresh, weak coffee, poured out a small one-half cupful, 
creamed and slightly sweetened it and took it up to the sick man. He 
drank it hot and in fifteen minutes called for more. An additional amount 
was made and also given to him hot. He again drank it, and then in a 
few moments called for more — which was given him. The third time

after taking the hot drink the hiccoughs left him for a lapse of five min- 
utes. This cessation of the hiccoughs, even though for only five minutes, 
encouraged the wife to urge more hot drink upon him. The next 
time the hiccoughs disappeared for a longer time. When they again 
came on, more hot coffee was administered and, to the doctors' sur- 
prise, next morning the patient was sleeping and well on the road to 
recovery. The doctors (three in number, all noted ones of the city of 
Chicago) said it was a miracle — but admitted that the hot drink did what 
medicine had failed to do. The Nurse. 

HICCOUGH CURE FOR CHILDREN. 

Many children are subject to this distressing complaint. A lump of 
sugar saturated with vinegar and given to the little one to suck will relieve 
it instantly. This is the recipe of a French physician, M. L. E. 

HICCOUGH CURE— No. 2. 

Small pieces of ice applied suddenly, so as to surprise the patient, will 
stop persistent hiccoughing. Also hot drinks of weak coffee and milk 
taken frequently have the desired effect. 

For swollen and bleeding gums rinse the mouth with a wine-glassful 
of warm water in which is placed about seven drops of myrrh. This will 
harden the gums and keep them from working off the teeth, which always 
gives them a bad appearance. ~ Mrs. Pachaly. 

ANTIDOTE FOR POISONING. 

If a person swallow any poison whatever, or has fallen into convulsions 
from having overloaded the stomach, an instantaneous remedy, more 
efffcient and applicable in a larger number of cases than any one-half 
dozen medicines we can think of, is a heaping teaspoonf ul of common salt 
and as much ground mustard, stirred rapidly in a teacupful of water, 
warm or cold, and swallowed instantly. It is scarcely down before it 
begins to come up, bringing with it the remaining contents of the stomach; 
and lest there be any remnant of poison, however small, let the white of 
an ^^^ or a teacupful of strong coffee be swallowed as soon as the 
stomach is quiet. These very common articles nullify a larger number of 
virulent poisons than any medicines in the shops. 

Great quantities of Paris green* are used during some seasons of the 
year, and as accidents may happen, it is well to know the antidote for the 
poison. Paris green owes its deadly properties to arsenic, as does Lon- 



5S4 PREVALENT DISORDERS AND THEIR REMEDIES. 

don purple. Should either of these be taken into the stomach, let the 
person drink copious draughts of milk or raw eggs beaten up, and as soon 
as possible give an emetic, mustard is as good as anything, and keep up 
the action of vomiting by giving milk between the paroxysms of vomiting. 
When the stomach no longer rejects what is swallowed give a good dose 
of castor oil. A. C. 

CAUTION. 

Never bite or pass sewing silk through the lips as lead poisoning has 
been known to result, as the silk is soaked in acetate of lead to make it 
weigh heavier. N. A. L. 

CRAHP IN BATHING. 

For the cure of the cramp when swimming Dr. Franklin recommends 
a vigorous and violent shock to the part affected by suddenly and forcibly 
stretching out the leg, which should be darted out of the water into the 
air if possible. G. H. 

CRAMP IN THE LEQ. 

A garter applied tightly around the limb affected will, in most cases, 
speedily remove the complaint. When it is more obstinate, a brick should 
be heated, wrapped in a flannel bag, and placed at the foot of the bed,, 
against which the person troubled may place his feet. No remedy, how- 
ever, is equal to that of diligent and long-continued friction. M. M. 

SUNSTROKE. 

Sunstroke is prevented by wearing a silk handkerchief in the crown 
of the hat, or green leaves, or a wet cloth of any kind; but, during an 
attack, warm water should be instantly poured on the head, or rags 
dipped in the water and renewed every minute. The reason is two-fold — 
the scalp is dry and hot and the warm water not only removes the dryness 
but carries off the extra heat with great rapidity by evaporation. G. L. 

NOSE BLEED. 

Snuffing up powdered alum will generally control troublesome bleed- 
ing from the nose. It will also almost always stop excessive hemorrhage 
from a cavity caused by the extraction of a tooth, by being placed in it. 

The best remedy for bleeding at the nose, as given by Dr. Gleason in 
one of his lectures, is in the vigorous motion of the jaws, as if in the act 
of mastication. In the case of a child a wad of paper should be placed in 
its mouth and the child should be instructed to chew it hard. It is the 
motion of the jaws that stops the flow of blood. This remedy is so very 



PREVALENT DISORDERS AND THEIR REMEDIES, 525 

simple that many will feel inclined to laugh at it, but it has never been 
known to fail in a single instance, even in very severe cases. E. H. 

CHOKING. 

To prevent choking, break an egg into a cup and give it to the per- 
son choking to swallow. The white of the egg seems to catch around the 
obstacle 2nd remove it. If one figg does not answer the purpose try 
another. The white is all that is necessary. V. S. T. 

CHOLERA INFANTUM. 

For cholera infantum, the white of two eggs, well beaten; then mix 
with water; add one teaspoonful of orange-flower water and a little 
sugar; a tablespoonful every hour. It will, says an authority, cure the 
Voorst case of cholera infantum, the egg coating the bowels. P. H. 

BUNIONS. 

Let fall a stream of very warm water from a teakettle, at the highest 
elevation from which the patient can bear the water to fall directly on 
the apex of the swelling; continue this once a day for a short time and a 
cure will be effected, providing you desist from wearing short shoes. The 
greater the elevation of the kettle the more effectual the remedy. 

It is said that the following is a good bunion remedy: Use pulverized 
saltpeter and sweet oil; obtain at the druggist's five or six cents' worth of 
saltpeter, put into a bottle with sufficient olive oil to nearly dissolve it; 
shake up well and rub the inflamed joints night and morning and more 
frequently if painful. This is a well-tried remedy. A. F. 

TO KILL CORNS. 

Soak bread in vinegar, bind on day and night and they will come out 

by the roots. S. T. N. 

TO KILL WARTS. 

Prick until they bleed; then apply soda. H. F. A. 

CURE FOR EXTERNAL CANCER. 

Apply as poultice bruised stramonium leaves. Stramonium affects 
some persons as the poison ivy does. In this case the antidote is strong 
salt water freely applied. M. H. P. Crandall. 

INTERNAL CANCER CURE. 

Take the dried blossoms of the common red clover, put them in hot 
water, let them steep over night and this will be a clover tea. Take a 



536 PREVALENT DISORDERS AND THEIR REMEDIES. 

tablespoonful of this tea five or six times daily. Cases of virulent cancer 
have been cured by this simple remedy. H. N. 

FELON CURE. 

Apply a poultice of raw onions three times a day and foul' days will 

effect a cure. E. G. 

FELON CURE— No. 2. 

The first symptoms of felon: The person imagines there is a briar in 
the inner covering of the bone, usually at the last joint of the finger. 
Then comes a slight swelling intense heat and throbbing. Remedy: 
Apply a soft cloth saturated with tincture of stramonium (generally known 
as jimson weed). Bind on with neatly laid bandage. This will prevent 
any further progress of the felon. M. Ho P. Crandall. 

TO COOL THE BLOOD. 

Take eight ounces of sarsaparilla, three ounces of root licorice, six 

ounces of wild cherry bark, one-half ounce of mandrake, one ounce of 

gentian, one-half teaspoonful each of cinnamon and red pepper. Boil in 

three gallons of rain water till reduced to one-half. Sweeten a very little. 

This is a fine drink for cooling the blood. Abstain from sweets while 

using it. M. H. N. 

BLOOD PURIFIER. 

Clover tea is a fine blood purifier, drank freely, removing pimples and 
whitening the skin. It is also a sleep-inducing draught. Its efficiency in 
early stages of cancer is unquestioned. H. F. L. 

TO COUNTERACT POISONOUS GAS. 

An ordinary gas jet consumes as much oxygen as four human bemgs. 

It is well when sitting long in a gas-lighted room to occasionally open a 

door or a window for a few moments and bring in some fresh air. Plants 

in pots do not thrive well in rooms where gas is used for illuminating or 

where it is used as fuel. - B. O. L. 

RELIEF FOR CHOLERA. 

One ounce of essence of peppermint, one ounce ot laudunum, one 
ounce of spirits of camphor, one ounce of spiced rhubarb, one teaspoon- 
ful of cayenne pepper. Dose: One-half teaspoonful as often as required 

to relieve pain. M. C. 

TO CLEAR A WASTE PIPE. 

Just before retiring at night pour into the clogged pipe enough liquid 
soda-lye to fill the "trap" or bent part of the pipe. Be sure that no water 



PREVALENT DISORDERS AND THEIR REMEDIES. 527. 

runs into it until the next morning. During the night the lye will convert 
all the offal into soft soap and the first current of water in the morning 
will wash it away and clear the pipe clean as new.

TO REMOVE PROUD FLESH. 

Pulverize loaf sugar very fine and apply it to the part affected. This 
is an easy remedy and is said to remove it entirely without pain . E. E. 

DROPSY CURE. 

A tea made of chestnut leaves and drank freely instead of water will 
relieve an obstinate case of dropsy in a few days. H. K. 

BLACKBERRY SYRUP FOR LOOSE BOWELS. 

Make a simple syrup of a pound of sugar to each pint of water and 
boil till it is rich and thick. Add as many pints of the expressed juice of 
ripe blackberries as there are pounds of sugar. Grate half a nutmeg to 
each quart of syrup and let it boil for from fifteen to twenty minutes. 
Then add one-half gill of fourth-proof brandy to each quart of syrup. Set 
it by till cold, then bottle for use. A tablespoonful for a child or a wine- 
glassful for an adult, is a dose. S. N. N. 

CARE OF THE EARS. 

Children's ears ought never to be boxed, for besides being an ill-man- 
nered way to punish one, it is liable to injure permanently the delicate 
membrane of the ear. Nor should the ear ever be ^'cleaned out with the 
screwed-up corner of a towel," much less with a bodkin. 

Popular Science Monthly. 

TO REMOVE LODGMENT IN THROAT. 

When a child swallows anything that lodges in the throat lift it sud- 
denly by the wrists. It will cause the little one to scream and cough and 
the object will generally be dislodged at once. P. T. 

A GOOD WAY TO TAKE CASTOR OIL. 

There is nothing better for a cold than castor oil and a very simple 
way to give it to children, is to make up a pan of molasses candy and add 
plenty of castor oil to it just before removing from the fire. The taste of 
oil in it cannot be detected. Julia Merrill. 



528 PREVALENT DISORDERS AND THEIR REMEDIES.

alcohol and bound around a baby's bowels when suffering with cholera 
infantum is excellent. L. B. 

CROUP. 

One teaspoonful of molasses and one teaspoonful of goose oil given 
to a child in the early stage of croup will relieve it at once. E. L. A. 

FOREIGN BODY IN THE EYE. 

As soon as anything gets into the eye, rub the well eye, and don't 
touch the other. If this does not remove it turn back the lid and with the 
point of a fine cambric or silk handkerchief remove the irritating body if 
it can be seen. If not, take a small syringe and gently inject tepid water 
under the lid. This will generally wash the offender out. John M. 

HOW TO CURE CHAFING. 

During warm weather many people suffer from chafing of the arm- 
pits. This can be prevented by thoroughly dusting the irritated parts 
with sub-nitrate of bismuth or calomel. L. S. 

HOW TO CURE MOSQUITO BITE. 

Take a teaspoonful of the tincture of wild rosemary to one-half tum- 
blerful of water and apply the lotion where the insect stung. J. G. 

TO MAKE EXCELLENT LINIMENT. 

Take one ounce of camphor, four ounces of olive oil. Dissolve the 
gum in the oil. By adding one-quarter of an ounce of chloroform a lini- 
ment is obtained which will allay any pain. Mrs. Paul S. 

HOW TO MAKE LINSEED POULTICE.

mass will not stick to it. M. H. 

HOW TO MAKE MUSTARD POULTICE. 

Take of dry mustard two ounces and mix it with the white of two 
eggs to a proper consistency. A teaspoonful of flour can be added. 
There are mustard plasters to be purchased at drug-stores which are far 
more available and always ready for use. Mrs. Wm. S.

TO REHOVE COLD IN THE HEAD. 

A cold in the head is very disagreeable. Inhale spirits of camphor 
when the first symptoms appear. Put one or two drops of the camphor 
on a small lump of sugar, dissolve in a wine-glassful of water and take a 
teaspoonful every two hours. J. R. 

TO CURE DIPHTHERIA. 

Relief has followed in the early stages of this terrible complaint by

on, wet in camphor, and use a gargle of salt and vinegar. Mrs. V. B. 

CURE FOR TOOTHACHE. 

One-quarter of a pint of best alcohol, one-half ounce of chloroform,

the face against the tooth. Sure cure. M. S. 

A GOOD CATHARTIC. 

One-half ounce each of peppermint leaf and jalap, one ounce of 
senna, two ounces of figs chopped fine. Dose: Put a teaspoonful of the 
mixture into a cup and pour upon it three tablespoonfuls of boiling water; 
drink when cold. Take before breakfast. Kunze, 

SPRAIN REMEDY. 

Take the white of two eggs and put into a cup; stir with a lump of 
alum the size of an English walnut until it jellies. Saturate a cloth and

The dry piles can readily be cured by a bruised onion, roasted in 
ashes. Dr. J. M. Smith.

ing piles. Or, take twice a day of the thin skin of walnuts as much as will

530 PREVALENT DISORDERS AND THEIR REMEDIES. 

PALPITATION OF THE HEART. 

A lady, about forty years of age, had suffered twelve years from peri- 
odical attacks of palpitation of the heart, so violent as to shake the bed on 
which the patient lay. During one attack, feeling thirsty, she expressed a 
desire for some soda-water. No sooner had she swallowed the first 
draught than her palpitation left her, and recurred no more until the 
period of the next attack. As soon as it commenced, she sent for her 
medical attendant, and told him what had occurred a month previously, 
and requested to be allowed to try the same remedy a second time. He 
consented, but, wishing to ascertain which of the ingredients of the soda- 
water had relieved the complaint, he gave her a dose of citric acid by 
itself. This had no effect. He then gave her a dose of carbonate of 
soda which also failed. He then mixed the powders and gave her some 
ordinary soda-water, placing his hand at the same time upon her heart. 
The moment she swallowed the first mouthful the palpitation ceased and 
recurred no more for that time. From that period, whenever the palpita- 
tion came on, she could always stop it by this simple remedy. It appears, 
from the experiments made by medical men that the carbonic acid was 
the active element in relieving the complaint, because, until the gas was 
liberated by the mixture of citric acid and the carbonate of soda, no bene- 
fit accrued. Journal of Health. 

SCROFULA. 

Take as much cream of tartar a slies on a nickel, every morning and 
evening. Or, make a leaf of dried burdock into a pint of tea; take one- 
half pint twice a day for four months. I have known this to cure 
hundreds. ]\j £ 

QUINSY. 

Roast four large onions. Peel them quickly and slightly pound. Add 
to them a little sweet oil. Place them while hot in a thin muslin bag 
that will reach from ear to ear, first thoroughly rubbing the throat and in 
this way getting up a good circulation of blood. Apply as warm as pos- 
sible to the throat. Change when the strength of the onions appears to 
be exhausted. Flannel must be worn round the neck after the onion is 
removed. ^ j^U^SE. 

ULCER. 

Wash thoroughly with Green's soft soap, rinse well and then saturate 
a piece of absorbent cotton with peroxide. Let this come to a foam and 
then sprinkle over a little iodoform; tie up carefully and repeat in six 
hours. Or, boil walnut-tree leaves in water with a little sugar. Apply 



PREVALENT DISORDERS AND THEIR REMEDIES. 531 

absorbent cotton dipped in this, changing it once in two days. This has 
done wonders. This has cured foul bones; yea, and a leprosy. Foment 
morning and evening with a decoction of mint; then sprinkle on it finely- 
powdered rue. Nurse. 

ABSCESS. 

An abscess requires the application of warm poultices and a cooling 
aperient medicine. The poultice may be made of bread and water, oat- 
meal or linseed meal. These should be applied till the abscess burstSv 
when it should discharge freely. Af<-er it has ceased, apply moist linen- 
for a day or two; then apply absorb-^nt cotton saturated with peroxide 
This will draw out the poison. If the healing is slow, dust the abscess 
over with iodoform. It is sometimes necessary when the bursting is slow 
and the pain great to open the abscess with the point of a lancet, which 
prevents much suffering. H. C. 

NIGHTMARE. 

This is a complaint which comes when the sleep is disturbed. It is 
the dreaming of something horrible and the person feels that it is some- 
thing from which he cannot escape but is the victim. He attempts to 
scream for help but usually his effort is in vain. Nervous and over- 
worked people are especially subject to it. It is due to poor circulation. 
It is not only unpleasant but dangerous. The best remedy is to bathe 
each morning in cold water on arising, eat plain foods, little or no meat, 
tea or coffee, and breathe deeply for fifteen minutes each night before 

retiring. B, S. Y. 

COLIC. 

There are few diseases attended with more pain, although not at all 
dangerous. It is a spasmodic affection of the bowels. It is caused by 
indigestible food, gas, and bile in the system. 

Remedy. — Apply hot flannel cloths wrung out in hot water. If the 

bowels are ti^ht an injection of hot water is excellent; so, also, is a hot 

foot bath. O. M. 

HOW TO CURE NOSEBLEED— REMEDY No. 2, 

Unless it is violent, do not interfere with a bleeding from the nose. A 
bleeding from the nose is frequently an effort of Nature to relieve itself, 
and unless it is likely to weaken the patient, ought not to be restrained. 
If it is necessary to restrain the bleeding, press the nose firmly between 
the finger and thumb for a few minutes, this alone will often stop the 
bleeding; if it should not, then try what bathing the nose, forehead and 
nape of the neck with water quite cold from the well, will do, or try the 
effect of a solution of alum. 



532 PREVALENT DISORDERS AND THEIR REMEDIES 

Take of powdered alum, one drachm, water, one-half pint; enough to 
make a lotion. A little of the lotion should be put into the palm of the 
hand and sniffed up the bleeding nostril. If this does not succeed some 
of the lotion ought to be syringed up the nose. Dr. P. B. Saur. 

TOBACCO SMOKING. 

I consider tobacco smoking one of the most injurious and deadly 
habits a boy or young man can indulge in. It contracts the chest and 
weakens the lungs, thus predisposing to consumption. It impairs the 
stomach, producing indigestion. It lebilitates the brain and nervous sys- 
tem, inducing epileptic fits and nervous depression. It stunts the growth 
and is one cause of the present race of pigmies. It makes the young lazy 
and disinclined to work. It is one of the greatest curses of the present 
day. Dr. Murphy. 

QUHBOIL. 

A decayed root of a tooth causes inflammation and abscess of the 
gum, which abscess breaks, and becomes a gumboil. Foment the outside 
of the face with a hot camomile and poppy-head fomentation and apply 
to the gumboil, between the cheek and the gum, a small white bread-and- 
milk poultice, which renew frequently. As soon as the gumboil has 
become quiet, by all means have the affected tooth extracted, or it may 
cause disease, and consequently serious injury to the jaw. Whenever the 
patient catches cold there will be a renewal of the inflammation of the 
abscess and the gumboil, and, as a matter of course, renewed pain, trouble 
and annoyance. Decayed fangs of teeth often cause the breath to be 
offensive. Dentist. 

TO CURE CORNS— REMEDY No. a. 

The best remedy for a hard corn is to remove it. The usual method 
of cutting, or of paring a corn away is erroneous. The following is the 
right way: Cut with a sharp pair of pointed scissors around the circum- 
ference of the corn. Work gradually round and round toward the center. 
When you have loosened well the edges you can either with your fingers 
or with a pair of forceps, generally remove the corn bodily and that with- 
out pain and the loss of any blood. This plan of treating a corn I can 
recommend to you as being most effectual. Dr. John Smith. 

CATARRH CURE. 

One drachm of golden seal powder, one quart of hot water, one tea- 
spoonful of common salt, one teaspoonful of white borax, ten drops of 



PREVALENT DISORDERS AND THEIR REMEDIES. 533 

weak carbolic acid. Mix and stand one hour. Then take a one-ounce 

bottle of liquid and pass through nostril; repeat same amount through 

other nostril. Dr. M. A. Rush. 

CATARRH REriEDY. 

Two ounces of powdered cubebs, two ounces of chamoline blows. 

Mix well together. Put a small portion into a clean pipe, smoke and 

draw the smoke back through the nose, three or four times daily. 

Dr. John. 
COUQH SYRUP— FINE. 

One ounce each of hoarhound and licorice, two ounces of gum arabic, 
one pint of molasses and one teacupful of vinegar. Boil the hoarhound 
in one quart of water; dissolve the licorice and gum arabic in a little 
water first. Strain the hoarhound before adding the other ingredients- 
Do not put in the vinegar until it is nearly done. Dr. Samuel Rogers. 

A SURE COUQH CURE. 

Three-eighths of an ounce of anise seed, three-eighths of an ounce of 
stick (or root) licorice three-eighths of an ounce of senna leaf and one- 
half pint of Jamaica rum. Pour one pint cf boiling water on the herbs 
and let them simmer slowly, down to one-half pint. Then strain and 
when cool add one-half pint of best syrup and one-half of a pint of rum. 
Take as often as required. This recipe has been in our family for years 
and has never failed. Myra Town,

men, until to-day it has come to be understood, that in order to gain 
approbation from a standpoint of looks, attention to the toilet is necessary. 

There is a great call for absolutely pure recipes and harmless sugges- 
tions in improving the skin, in warding off wrinkles; in preserving the 
hair, in keeping the figure erect, teaching good poise, etc., etc. I give 
only those that have been tried and pronounced a success. 

Among the many things made possible for women by nineteenth cen- 
tury science is a beautiful complexion and a graceful form. 

Age need make no difference in these days of progress — the woman of 
fifty is as attractive and as much admired as her young daughter. 

Is your skin wrinkled and old-looking, your complexion muddy and 
unhealthy, your neck, cheeks, arms or breasts shrunken and unsightly? 
Why not remedy the matter? 

THE ROYAL ROAD TO BEAUTY. 

Breathe deeply ^ bathe daily — think joy, not sorrow — eat wisely and nevef 
Speak unkindly, 

A CHEERFUL DISPOSITION. 

A cheerful disposition and an optimistic view of life do much toward 
making the beauty suppliant, plump of outline and charming of counte- 
nance. When one is blue and moody, the appetite fails, the stomach 
sulks, digestion and assimilation are interfered with and the entire body 
suffers from malnutrition. One should get out of doors. Exercise 
moderately and rest a good deal. Read helpful books. I would suggest 
Ralph Waldo Trine's works. Sleep always in a well-ventilated room. 
One-half hour before breakfast take a dessert-spoonful of pure olive oil 
in a little lemon juice. The olive oil feeds the system, aids digestion and 
stimulates the bowels.

SUFFICIENT TIME FOR EATING. 

(From "The Pilgrim.") 

Julia Holmes Smith, M. D., in "Hints for Right Living," says: "We 
should give more time to the ingestion of our food; good humor should 
be cultivated and the hour spent at the table dedicated to the goddess of 
leisure, although unfortunately the habits of American life make us echo 
Jean Ingelow's plaint: 

'If leisure is, but ah, 't is not, 

The fashion of it man forgot 

About the days of chivalry/ 

"At the table the family should early be trained to avoid all unpleasant 
themes, even the criticism of the children's table habits should be reserved 
for an aftermath. Many a child's appetite is spoiled by the sharp toi.e of 
the mother, 'Hold your fork straight and don't bite your teaspoon.' It 
should be the object of each and all to get in if possible a good bit of fun, 
for, 'A hearty laugh aideth digestion.' 

" The housewife who keeps her trials to retail to her husband at meal- 
times, and the man who brings home business anxieties, which he imper- 
tinently intrudes, sin not alone against propriety, but against hygiene as 
well; because anxiety, sorrow, or sudden shock are known to have a very 
serious effect upon digestion, acting through a curious little nerve center 
called the solar plexus, which lies just back of the stomach and sends its 
tendrils to almost all parts of the digestive system. It is difficult to find 
the filaments of this plexus even with the microscope and yet so impor- 
tant is it in our organism that Virchow, the great German authority, called 
this solar plexus the abdominal brain, since it acts through the sympa- 
thetic nervous system upon almost every part of the organism." 

THE COMPLEXION. 

The most perfect form will avail woman little unless it possesses also 
that brightness which is the finishing touch and final polish of a beautiful 
lady. 

Blessed is the woman who has a clear complexion. She little knows 
how much she has to be thankful for, and since these women are very 
scarce it behooves the rest of us to make up by the care we take of our 
complexion where nature has slighted us. 

The principal source of a bad complexion in otherwise healthy women 
is generally caused by comedos, commonly called flesh worms. This is 
specifically a disease of puberty and consequently self-limited. These are 
affections of the sebaceous glands of the skin and consequently can be

prevented by keeping It In a healthy condition, which can be done by 
following these instructions. 

Comedones should be extracted by the aid of a watch key or a comedo 
extractor, which can be bought for the purpose. Pimples should be 
opened with a fine, thoroughly clean needle and the purulent contents 
expressed, after which the face must be shampooed with either the alka- 
line spirit of soap of hebra, which can be obtained in any drug store, or 
the plain, genuine green soap or saigo fluid soap. 

The process of shampooing should be thorough. One should spend 
ten minutes over a basin of water as hot as can be borne lathering every 
particle of the skin, then it should be well rinsed in clean, hot water and 
after thorough friction of the surface and perfectly drying the same with 
a soft towel. 

When the skin is harsh, dry and prematurely shows signs of wrinkles 
it is generally a sign that the skin is not well nourished, in which case 
after shampooing as directed above, a towel ought to be wrung out of 
water as hot as can be borne, folded in three or four thicknesses and 
applied over the face, pressing it close against the eyes and skin and 
allowed to remain a few minutes in order to draw the blood to the surface 
and open the pores of the skin, then the skin should be fed by thoroughly 
anointing it with cold cream, cocoa butter or olive oil. 

To prevent the cracking of the hands and wrists and to keep the 
hands soft in the severest weather, they ought to be soaked in hot water, 
completely and thoroughly dried over the stove or register and anointed 
with camphor ice. 

Glycerine ought never to be used alone, only in lotions, as it has a 
tendency to make the skin harsh and dry. 

COLD CREAM. 

Three-fourths of an ounce of sperm, one-half ounce of white wax, 
four ounces of oil of sweet almonds, one-half ounce of rose water, one-half 
ounce of glycerine, one-half drachm of borax, five to ten drops of oil of 
rose water; melt together with moderate heat, in a granite dish, the sperm 
and wax, add oil of sweet almonds (do not overheat) dissolve borax in 
glycerine and rose water, and add to oil and wax as it begins to cool, then 
whip thoroughly in a Keystone egg-beater or with a wire egg-beater until 
it begins to cream, then add oil of rose. C. O. 

CAflPHOR ICE. 

One-half ounce of sperm, one ounce of white wax, two ounces oil of 
sweet almonds or cotton-seed oil; melt together with gentle heat, then add 



TOILET SUGGESTIONS AND RECIPES. 537 

one-half ounce of camphor; when dissolved and partly cooled add four 
drops of oil of bitter almonds and eight drops of oil of mace; pour mto 
molds. Druggist. 

GLYCERINE CREAM. 

Three-fourths of an ounce of sperm; one-half ounce of white wax, 
four ounces of cotton-seed oil, one-half ounce of camphor, one-half ounce 
of rose water, two drachms of glycerine, ten grains of powdered borax; 
melt together the sperm and white wax, add the oil, then the camphor; 
when dissolved add the glycerine mixed with the rose water and borax; 
stir until nearly cold, then pour into molds. F- M. 

EXCELLENT CREAn FOR THE COMPLEXION. 

A cream that is perfectly harmless, so harmless, indeed, that mothers 
need not hesitate to rub it on infants' faces, has the juice of strawberries 
as a principal ingredient. The formula is: 

One-half ounce of white wax, one-half ounce of spermaceti, two and 
one-half ounces of oil of sweet almonds, three-fourths of an ounce of 
strawberry juice, three drops of tincture of benzoin, two drops of oil of rose. 

Be sure that your druggist gives you only one-half ounce of the wax 
and -of the spermaceti. More than this will make the emollient hard and 
crumbly. The correct amount will give you a cream of perfect con^ 
sistency. Take large, fresh strawberries, wash and] drain thoroughly. 
Macerate and strain through muslin. Shave the wax and spermaceti and 
put in a porcelain kettle over a slow fire. When they have melted add 
the almond oil. Heat slightly, remove from fire and pour in the straw- 
berry juice. Fluff up quickly with an egg beater. When the mixture 
begins to cream add the benzoin and the perfume. Put into little jars and 
keep in a cool place. Apply at any time. Excellent for tan, sunburn, or 

rough skin. 

SURE CURE FOR PIMPLES. 

It requires self-denial to get rid of pimples, for persons troubled with 
them will persist in eating fat meats and other articles of food calculated 
to produce them. Avoid the use of rich gravies, or pastry, or anythmg of 
the kind in excess. Take all the outdoor exercise you can and never 
indulge in a late supper. Retire at a reasonable hour and rise early m the 
morning. Sulphur to purify the blood may be taken three times a week— 
a thimbleful in a glass of milk before breakfast. It takes some time for 
the sulphur to do its work, therefore persevere in its use till the humors, 
or pimples have all disappearedo ^^ ^- ■'^^ 



538 TOILET SUGGESTIONS AND RECIPES, 

HOW TO OBTAIN A HANDSOME FORM. 

The foundation for a beautiful form must undoubtedly be laid in 
infancy. That is, nothing should be done at that tender age to obstruct 
the natural swell and growth of all the parts. "As the twig is bent, the 
tree's incline," is quite a true of the body as of the mind. Common sense 
teaches us that the young fibers ought to be left unincumbered by 
obstacles of art, to grow harmoniously into the shape that nature drew. 

It is important that the girl should understand, as soon as she 
comes to the years of discretion, or as soon as she is old enough to 
realize the importance of beauty to a woman, that she has, to a certain 
extent, the management of her own form within her power. The first 
thing to be thought of is health, for there can be no development of 
beauty in sickly fibers. Plenty of exercise, in the open air, is the great 
recipe. Exercise, not philosophically and with religious gravity undertaken, 
but the wild romping activities of a spirited girl. Everything should be done 
to give joy and vivacity to the spirits at this age, for nothing so much aids 
in giving vigor and elasticity to the form as these. A crushed, or sad, or 
or moping spirit, allowed at this tender age, when the shape is forming, is 
a fatal cause of a flabby and moping body. A bent and stooping form is 
quite sure to come of a bent and stooping spirit. If you would have the 
shape "sway gracefully on the firmly-poised waist" — if you would see the 
chest rise and swell in noble and healthy expansion, give the girl vigorous 
exercise in the open air. 

And what is good for the girl is good for the woman too. The same 
attention to the laws of health and the same pursuit of out-door exercise 
will help a person to develop a handsome form until she is twenty or twenty- 
five years old. "Many a rich lady would give all her fortune to possess 
the expanded ch°st and rounded arm of her kitchen girl. Well, she 
might have had both by the same amount of exercise and spare living." 
And she can do much to aquire them even yet. 

There have been many instances of sedentary men, with shrunk and 
sickly forms, with deficient muscle and scraggy arms, who by a change of 
business to a vigorous outdoor exercise acquired fine robust forms, with 
arms as powerful and muscular as Hercules himself. I knew a young 
lady, who, at twenty-two years of age, in a great degree overcame the 
deformity of bad arms. She began by a strict adherence to such a strong 
nutritious diet as was most favorable to the creation of muscle. She 
walked every day several hours in the open air, and never neglected the 
constant daily use of the dumb-bells. This she continued for two years. 



TOILET SUGGESTIONS AND RECIPES. 539 

when a visible improvement showed itself, in the straightened and ex- 
panded chest; and in the fine hard swell of muscle upon the once de- 
formed arms. She had fought and she had conquered. Her perseverance 
was abundantly rewarded. Let the person, who is ambitious for such 
ci-iarms, be assured that, if she has them not, they can be obtained on no 
lighter conditions. H. E. F. 

HOW TO REDUCE THE PORES OF THE SKIN. 

An excellent astringent wash which will make enlarged pores smaller 
and less unsightly is made by putting into a one-half-pint bottle one and 
one-half ounces of cucumber juice, half filling the bottle with elder-flower 
water, adding one ounce of eau de cologne, and shaking well; adding one- 
half ounce of simple tincture of benzoin and filling bottle with elder- 
flower water. Get the juice of the cucumbers by slicing, without peeling, 
adding a suggestion of water, boiling to a pulp, cooling, and straining 
through muslin. Stimulating the functions of the skin by a daily bath 
with a soft flesh brush and tepid salt water will make the complexion 
clearer. The skin all over the body is constantly undergoing a process of 
decay and renewing. Unless the epidermis is kept clean and free from 
the excretions that the pores are continually sending out, this process of 
renewing is very much hampered. G. M. 

FOR A ROUGH SKIN. 

You will find camphorated cream the best emollient. It is very easily 
made as follows: Take four ounces of olive oil, one-quarter of an ounce of 
white wax, one ounce of spermaceti, one ounce of lanoline, one-eighth of 
an ounce of camphor gum. Heat the five ingredients until the camphor 
is dissolved, take off the stove, beat with an egg-beater until the mass 
concretes, use as you would cold cream or any other unguent. C. F. 

TO CLEAR A SALLOW SKIN. 

The real cure for a sallow skin must be from within. One can, of 
course, use for the face a whitener which will temporarily make it look 
fair, or can use a face bleach, but the best plan is to try to remove 
the cause, which is probably a sluggish liver. 

One should not drink coffee or eat highly-spiced fooa and should 
never touch pork or greasy dishes. Plenty of ripe fruit, oranges, partic- 
ularly, will assist in clearing the skin. As a medicine take one teaspoon- 
ful of phosphate of soda in a glassful of hot water every morning one 
hour before breakfast; repeat the dose at night one hour before retiring. 
Continue to take the soda for three or four weeks, or as long as reguired.

OBSTINATE BLACKHEADS. 

For obstinate blackheads try the following: Four ounces of tincture 
of green soap, four and one-half ounces of distilled witch hazel; mix; 
apply every second day and wash off immediately with hot water. You 
may be obliged to press on either side of the blackhead and force it out. 
The most stubborn cases will usually yield to this treatment. G. A. M. 

WRINKLES. 

If you have lost any teeth that will account for the lines, otherwise 
you should not have wrinkles before sixty. There is no other treatment 
that will take the place of massage for obliterating wrinkles. H. C. 

CURE OF PIMPLES ON THE FACE. 

Hard red pimples are a common and an obstinate affection of the 
skin, affecting the forehead, temples, the nose, chin and cheeks; occasion- 
ally attacking the neck, shoulders, back and chest. As they more fre- 
quently affect the young and are disfiguring, they cause much annoyance. 
I find, in these cases, great benefit from bathing the face, night and morn- 
ing, with strong salt and water — a tablespoonful of table salt to a teacupful 
of water: paying attention to the bowels; living on plain, wholesome, 
nourishing food; and taking a great deal of outdoor exercise. Sea bath- 
ing is often very beneficial. Grubs and worms have a mortal antipathy 
to salt. Dr. Stevenson. 

ROUND SHOULDERS. 

Deep breathing exercises and light gymnastics will cure all of round 
shoulders if they will be persistently practiced in. It would be impossible 
for me to tell you how many girls I have seen made straight and robust 
through the simplest exercises of this nature. O. L. 

CARE OF THE TEETH. 

The teeth ought to be brushed after every meal. Any one suffering 
with decayed teeth ought to make it a rule to use a gargle of one cupful 
of tepid water and one-half teaspoonful of Listerine. H. T. R. 

RULES FOR THE REDUCTION OF FLESH. 

Avoid all starchy and sweetened food, all cereals, vegetables contain- 
ing sugar or starch, such as peas, beans, corn, potatoes, etc. Have your 
bread toasted; sprinkle it with salt instead of butter. Milk, I regret to 
say, if it be pure and good, is fattening. Hot water is an excellent sub- 



TOILET SUGGESTIONS AND RECIPES. 541 

stitute for other liquids. Add a little of the juice of limes or lemons to it, 
if you choose. Limit your sleeping hours to seven at the outside. No 
naps. You must take exercise. 

If you cannot walk at least five miles a day and do not wheel, go to 
one of the institutions where mechanical massage is given. Several of my 
correspondents report excellent results from this method of getting the 
vigorous exercise they require. The system is thoroughly wholesome 
and not expensive. In reducing flesh the one fact to recollect is that fat 
is carbon — oxygen destroys or burns out carbon. You must consume the 
carbon by the oxygen you take through your lungs. The more exercise 
the more' oxygen and consequent destruction of fat by the one healthful 
method of curing obesity. The more starch and sugar you eat the more 
carbon to burn away. M. Y. 

CARE OF THE HAIR. 

Before retiring the hair should be well brushed. A stiff brush is best 
for this purpose, as it penetrates the hair and causes a healthy reaction 
and stimulation of the scalp, and the hair follicles thus have a tendency to 
keep the hair from falling out and prevent the common disease of the 
sebaceous glands, called dandruff. The care of the hair includes a sham- 
poo once a week with good, pure soap, German green soap being the best; 
then it must be rinsed well and quickly dried. D. P. 

HARnONIOUS COLORS FOR RED HAIR. 

Auburn hair of itself is beautiful, but one rarely meets an auburn- 
haired girl who knows just what color suits her best. The girl whose hair 
is of any shade of so-called red must never, under any circumstances, wear 
pink, red or bright yellow. Those colors will only accentuate the reds in 
her hair and the contrast is exceedingly unbecoming. 

She may, however, wear golden browns and plenty of them. These 
will bring out the ruddy gold tints of her hair. She may also wear light 
and dark shades of blue and green, dark purple, gray, white and lavender 
with a blue cast. And when properly dressed, the red-haired girl is a real 
beauty. O. G. 

TO MAKE THE HAIR GROW. 

The following remedy is excellent, as everyone who has tried it can 
testify. Have it put up at the drug-store. Seventy-five grains of beta 
napthol, seventy-five grains of hydrarg ammon, two ounces of lano- 
line and ungt. aqua Rosal in equal parts. Mix and apply to scalp after 
each shampoo. Dr. M. Bush.

TO REMOVE FRECKLES. 

These are caused by an over-production of pigment in the skin, which 

seems to be brought out in spots by the action of the sun's rays. They 

can be made to disappear by the use of acid lacti, glycerina, of each one 

fluid drachm. Apply night and morning with a sponge. Another remedy 

is powdered niter moistened with water and applied to the face night and 

morning. W. S, 

CURE FOR A BROWN THROAT. 

When the neck and throat have taken on a brown tinge from 

exposure to the sun or from wearing the high stock collars so fashionable, 

it can be remedied by using the following paste: Beat up an Qgg, add one 

ounce of honey, one teaspoonful of lemon juice, six drops of oil of bitter 

almonds and enough fine oatmeal to make it into a paste. Use morning 

and night. D. J. A. 

TO MAKE A HANDSOME THROAT. 

To have a rounded throat, sing, whether you have a "voice" or not, 
deeming the exercise valuable. At night wrap the throat in a linen cloth, 
wet with scented oil. This will nourish the skin and soften its outlines. 
Exercise the throat every day by turning the head from side to side slowly 
but never fast. Try this ten minutes every night and morning. Friction 
is too rough treatment for ordinary skins. If used to prevent wrinkles 
it should be gentle and with a little massage cream on the fingers.

boil in spirits of wine till it becomes a rich tincture. Bottle it. Wash the 
face three times a day with fifteen drops poured into a glassful of water, 
leaving it on the face to dry. It will remove spots, eruptions, etc. 

Mary R. 
TO CLEANSE THE HAIR AND SCALP. 

A noted lecturer on hygiene gave me this recipe and I have found it 
very satisfactory: Into a pint bottle put a spoonful of olive oil and add two 
ounces of best spirits of ammonia or hartshorn; shake. Then mix with 
three ounces of alcohol, and, when thoroughly mixed, fill the bottle with 
soft water. Remember to put in the ingredients in the order named or 
you will have "stuff" and no chemical union at all. 

To apply, take a spoonful or two of this, with a little warm water; 
dip a sponge or rag in and wet the scalp thoroughly, now rinse off in 
plenty of warm water and you will be surprised at the amount of dirt, 
though you may have thought your head perfectly clean. For the heads 
of young infants it is just the thing, as it instantly removes the scurf which 
sometimes troubles them, without pain or trouble. It should be weaker 
for a babe than for an adult. Mrs. E. M. Voorhees.

of bay rum, one-half pint of clear alcohol, one-half ounce of castor oil,

HAIR DRESSING. 

A nice dressing for the hair is cold tea. Use it every day and a head 
of glossy, luxuriant hair will result. Black tea is the best. M. P. 

HAIR TONIC. 

A splendid tonic for the hair is made of one ounce of glycerine, one- 
quarter of a pint of eau de cologne (strongest), one fluid drachm of liquor 
of ammonia (880-882), one-half fluid drachm each of oil of origanum, oil of 
rosemary and one fluid ounce of tincture of cantharides. Briskly agitate 
them together for eight or ten minutes, then add one-half pint of cam- 
phor-julep (strongest). Electricity, properly applied, will often do wonders 
toward restoring vitality to the hair. M. 

GROOMING THE HAIR. 

A writer in one of our journals advances a new idea with reference to 
the way in which thin hair should be "groomed," as they say in Paris, to 
induce the growth and thickening. It is merely brushing the hair the 
wrong way and is done as described below. It is said to be more beneficial 
than a tonic. 

Carefully divide the hair into many small parts and then, with a huge 

and stiff brush begin the work. Holding the extreme end of the strand 

to be brushed in the left hand, start at the bottom of it and brush upward 

toward the head. After each strand has gone through this process 

smooth each hair back into its original position. Follow this up and brush 

the hair in this manner each night and morning. It serves as a stimulant 

to the sickly hair. Frances Samuels.

If your eyebrows are inclined to grow thin in spots, a very simple

TO CLEAN HAIR BRUSHES. 

Dissolve a generous piece of washing soda in warm water, dip t-he 
bristles of the brush into it, rubbing them a little with the hand. Be care- 
ful not to touch the ivory or ebony back of the brush with the soda water. 
Rinse in warm water, turn the brush up on the point of the handle and let 
dry thoroughly. It is claimed that a tablespoonful of ammonia will do the 
same amount of cleaning if dissolved in a quart of water. The brush 
should not be used till dry. Fannie Smith. 

MASSAGE FOR THE EYES. 

Whenever your organs of sight feel weak do not rub them roughly. 
You must not massage your eyes the same way you would the stronger 
parts of the body. They need help from the hands, but this help must be 
administered in a very gentle and delicate manner. 

John Quincy Adams had a way of treating his eyes which, it is said, 
preserved their vision to old age, without the help of spectacles. This 
was to place his thumb and forefinger each upon an eyelid and gently rub 
them toward the nose a number of times each day. The action encour- 
ages circulation of blood in that locality, does away with the tiny spots 
that sometimes float before the vision and prevents that flattening of the 
lenses which causes dimness of sight at a certain focus. It is wonderful 
how much good can be done the eyes of people of all ages by using this 
simple exercise ten or fifteen minutes each day. F. S. 

TOOTH WASH. 

Two ounces of fine ground myrrh, two ounces of Peruvian bark, two 
ounces of orris root. Put them into a large bottle with two tablespoonfuls 
of white sugar. Fill the bottle with alcohol, shake it well and let stand a 
week. Then pour off all that is clear into another bottle. Steep two 
ounces of white oak bark one hour in a quart of water. When boiled 
down to one pint add it to the alcohol which has been poured off the 
myrrh and it is ready for use. W. P. C. 

TOOTH POWDER. 

A nice and safe tooth powder is made of prepared chalk, one-half

mixed together. G. E. Mills.

Forty grains of finely-powdered boracic acid, thirty grains of chlorate 
of potassium, twenty grains of powdered guaracum, sixty grains of pre-

of attar of roses. This powder will loosen all the tartar on the teeth and 

sweeten the breath. G. H. A. 

THE HANDS. 

The little housewife must pay constant attention to her hands if she 
would keep them white and soft. If you can afford it use white castile 
when washing your dishes. Or, better still, get a dish mop and keep your 
hands out of the suds as much as possible. 

Clipping the finger nails, instead of filing them, will cause them to 
become brittle and coarse. Apply white vaseline at night to make the 
cuticle about the nails soft and pliable. S. C. 

TO WHITEN THE HANDS. 

Put a few drops of lemon juice into the white of an ^gg. If lemons 
are not at hand, a little alum water will answer. Rub some of this mix- 
ture on the hands at night, letting it dry on. This lotion is equally good 

for the face and neck. L. F. P. 

REMEDY FOR CHAPPED HANDS. 

Boil one pint of rain water. When cold add one heaping tablespoon- 
full of Rochelle salts, one teaspoonful of tincture of benzoin. Perfume

TO MAKE THE HANDS SOFT. 

Take one drachm of cubebs, one and one-half ounces of glycerine, 
one-half ounce of spirits of camphor, one drachm of extract of heliotrope. 
Rub this on the hands on retiring, and wear a loose pair of old kid gloves.

TO REMOVE SCALES FROn THE HANDS. 

Indian meal moistened with a little vinegar or lemon juice is excellent

the wart and tie it on. Strips of sticking plaster will fasten it on. Take 
the meat off in the daytime and put it on at night. In two weeks the wart 
will die and fall off. K. P. 

REMEDY FOR TAINTED BREATH. 

Many people are fond of onions and yet do not wish to make thetn- 
selves offensive by eating them. This simple corrective will allow any one 
to indulge their appetite in this particular: Dissolve one-half teaspoonful 
of soda in boiling water and drink it. Orris root is also good, and rose 
pastilles sweeten the breath. Mrs. Martha Ketchum. 

TO INDUCE SLEEP. 

When one is overtired or worried and cannot sleep, being gently 
rubbed all over with a towel wrung out of hot salt water generally has the 
desired effect. Deep breathing in fresh air through the nostrils is also 
excellent. T. O. C. 

PERFUMERY AND SACHET POWDERS. 

The use of perfumery is not only refreshing, but invigorating, espe- 
cially in winter, when it reminds one of the balmy, sweet-laden atmosphere 
of spring. 

Perfumes should never be used to conceal any unpleasant odor. 
People of true refinement and good taste will always be known by the per- 
fumery they use. Scrupulous cleanliness alone goes hand in hand with a 
delicate odor, and whenever the use of strong odors is detected that leave 
an unpleasant scent of musk or civet, the suspicion is at once aroused that 
the strong odor has been employed to conceal an offensive one. N. 

FLORIDA WATER— HOW TO MAKE. 

This can be made by any one by the following formula: Oil of 
lavender, one fluid ounce; oil of bergamot, one fluid ounce; oil of neroli, 
one-half drachm; oil of orange, one drachm; oil of clove, one-quarter 
drachm; pure musk, one grain; cologne spirit (96 per cent.) one quart; 
tincture of tonca, enough to give it a color. Steep or let stand and 
bruise fifteen days and filter. Hattie Schmidt. 

ROSE WATER. 

Eight drops of oil of rose, twenty grains of carbonate of magnesium 
and water to make a pint. Rub the oil of rose with the magnesium in a 
mortar and slowly add the water. Then filter. M. A.

COLOGNE. 

Use of alcohol, one gallon; oil of lavender, twelve drachms; oil of 
rosemary, four drachms; essence of lemon, twelve drachms; oil of berga- 
mot, twelve drachms; oil of cinnamon, twelve drops. Mix and shake 
together three or four times a day for two weeks. Julia Hoff. 

LAVENDER WATER. 

Take four ounces of oil of lavender, one ounce of orris root, one quart 
of spirits of wine. Mix well and set aside for two weeks. Then strain it 
through blotting paper and it is ready to use. Sadie. 

HELIOTROPE. 

Six drachms of fine, fresh orris root, three drachms of fresh powdered 
rose leaves, three drachms of cassia flowers, two drachms of tonca beans, 
two drachms of vanilla, eight drops of oil of bitter almonds and as much 
extract of musk as desired. Grate the beans or pulverize in a metallic 
mortar, crumble the cassia flowers and buy the orris root and the rose 
leaves in the powdered form. Mix well. May. 

VIOLET. 

One and three-quarter ounces of powdered orris root, one ounce of 
cassia flowers, one-quarter ounce of gum benzoin, two drops of oil of 
rose, one small drop of oil of bitter almonds; moisten with one drachm of 
extract of violetc Lizzie Nieman. 

GERMAN COLOGNE. 

Take one and one-quarter gallons of alcohol, one ounce of oil of 
bergamot, one ounce of oil of lemon, one-quarter ounce of oil of neroli, 
one-quarter ounce of oil of sandal wood and thirty grains of camphor. 
Mix thoroughly, let stand fourteen days when it is ready. Keep in 
tightly-corked glass bottles. Dr. P. 

SACHET POWDER. 

A charming sachet powder for wardrobes, boxes, etc., far finer than 
any mixture sold at the shops, is the following: Coriander, orris root, 
rose leaves and aromatic calamus, each one ounce; lavender flowers, two 
ounces; rhodium wood, one-fourth of a drachm; musk, five grains. 
These are to be mixed and reduced to a coarse powder. This scent on 
clothes is as if all fragrant flowers had been pressed in their folds.

Nuisdiiices about the House. 

TO TREAT RATS AND MICE. 

When these pests of the kitchen are troublesome, and "puss" is not 
on duty, they may be soon disposed of by the following strategy: Put a 
barrel with a little meal in it, in a place where they "most do congregate." 
After having been fed long enough to relieve the "oldest and most expe- 
rienced rat" of his suspicions, fill the barrel one-third or one-half full with 
water, and sprinkle the meal two or three inches deep on the top of it. 
In some cases a dozen or more are thus caught in a night. J. T. 

TO DESTROY MOTHS. 

Forty ounces of alcohol, five ounces of tincture of capsicum, one 
ounces of napthalene, one ounce of phenol, one-half ounce of menthol, 
one-half ounce of oil of lemon grass; mix and filter. To be used in the 
form of a spray, by means of an atomizer, where the moths are found. 

TO KILL COCKROACHES. 

An infallible means of destroying black beetles and cockroaches is to 
strew the roots of black hellebore on the floor at night. Next morning 
the whole family of these insects will be found either dead or dying, for 
such is their avidity for the poisonous plant, that they never fail to eat it 
when they can get it. But be very cautious about burning all the refuse 
on the floor, for hellebore is a deadly poison to the human family as well. 

TO KILL COCKROACHES— No. 3. 

The Kest method to destroy cockroaches is to plentifully scatter pul- 
verized borax in all places where they appear. I have done this around 
the kitchen where there have been thousands and killed them all in one 

night. L. Miller. 

BED BUG EXTERMINATOR. 

One-half ounce of corrosive sublimate, five ounces of boiling water, 
two drachms of hydrochloric acid. Dissolve and add one-half pint of 
alcohol. Very poisonotis. Apply with a feather in cracks and crevices 
of beds, etc. A positive preventive of bed bugs. F. R. 

BED BUG EXTERMINATOR— No. 2. 

The best method ever tried to kill bed bugs is to thoroughly saturate 

the bedstead with common coal oil (kerosene). Repeat two or three 

times. Iron beds are much better than wood because bugs cannot hide 

themselves. L. B.

*'" I ^HE training of children is a preparation for the gravest and most 
A important relations of life; and upon the character of our home 
life must rest the well being of our nation, and the permanence of all our 
institutions." 

While some parents still endorse the old saying, that children should 
be seen and not heard, I say, make their life happy. They are young but 
once. What one of you has ever forgotten the day that your mother 
made you a Christmas or a Birthday cake and decorated it with goodies. 

For the benefit of those mothers who desire to specially please the 
little folks, we add some dishes that are unique, tasteful and "darling," as 
some boys and girls have called them. 

COLONIAL HATS. 

One large cup of seeded and chopped raisins, the juice and grated 
rind of one lemon, one cup of sugar, whites of two eggs and a pinch of salt. 
Mix well. Put tablesoonfuls of this mixture on rounds of piecrust from six 
to seven inches in diameter and very thinly rolled. Fold together from 
three directions, so that the shape will resemble a George Washington 
hat. Press the edges so firmly together that none can escape. Lay in 
baking pan, brush over with milk in which a little sugar is dissolved. 
Bake twenty minutes. Lillie Tibbits. 

NUT CARTOONS. 

Take the desired number of English walnuts, Brazilian nuts, hickory 
nuts and peanuts and with gold and colored paints decorate the shells in 
fantastic styles. With a little color they can be converted into all sorts 
of men and women — white, black and mongolian, wearing all sorts of cos- 
tumes, from gold lace, beads and jewels, to silks, feathers, furs, etc. (Very 
pretty for parties.) Mrs. D. Z. Brooks.

BIRTHDAY P ARTIES 551 

OLIVES A LA NATURAL HISTORY. 

Take the desired number of olives and into one side stick four cloveE 
and at the end another and you have a partially constructed animal rep- 
resenting an ant-eater. Now add another clove for the head, and on the 
end put a bit of another olive, and you have the animal complete and 
standing on his feet. The back can be decorated as fancy dictates. 
According to the arrangement and length of the feet, head and tail, other 
animals, and even birds, can be made. (Fine for children's parties.) 

Mrs. a. E. Fowler. 

LITTLE PIQS IN BLANKETS. 

(Try them.) 

Take one quart of good-sized oysters, wash and drain. Now beat up 
an ^gg, add to it a little milk and salt. Dip each oyster separately into 
the ^gg and roll in cracker or bread crumbs, then roll up in a thin slice 
of bacon. Hold in shape by sticking a toothpick through it. Drop in 
hot pan and fry brown. (Fine for special suppers.) 

Mrs. a. E. Fowler. 

EQQ NESTS ON TOAST. 

(Nice for Easter Supper.) 

Six eggs, six slices toast, one-half teaspoon salt, one and one-naif table- 
spoons butter. Separate the whites from the yolks, beating the whites to 
a stiff froth, but leaving the yolks whole in the half shells. Put the salt 
in the whites, and when beaten heap on the toast. Make a depression in 
each mound and put into it a moderate teaspoonf ul of butter and yolk of 
one ^g%. Place the nests in a moderate oven and cook for three minutes. 
Serve immediately on a hot dish. A spoonful of finely chopped ham may 

be spread upon the toast before the whites of the eggs. 

Mrs. Bowerman. 

CONSOMMfe ST. VALENTINE. 

One pound of lean beef, one pound of veal, may be cut into small 
pieces, and placed in a kettle where two tablespoons of butter have been 
allowed to brown. The meat should be then stirred into the butter until 
it is quite brown. Cover the kettle and simmer slowly a half-hour. Add 
one quart and a pint of water, and slowly simmer for three hours. Then 
add one onion, a stalk of celery, and one carrot, and simmer half an 
hour longer. Strain and let it stand to cool. Then remove the fat, and 
it is ready for use. 

When ready to serve heat and put In each dish sippets of toast cut to 
resemble such letters of the alphabet as spell St. Valentine. Alphabetical 
crackers can be bought for this purpose if preferred:

NOTE — Figures given are based upon 100%. Where the percent- 
ages do not make a total of 100 the unimportant deficiency is com- 
posed of waste materials. 

REFERENCE : The most important food elements are as follows : 

NITROGENOUS COMPOUNDS— Albumen, Casein, Fibrin and 
Gluten — contained in lean meats, eggs, fish, milk, etc., also classed as 
Proteid or Albuminous substances are needed for the formation of 
muscles and other tissues of the human body. CARBON, OXYGEN 
and HYDROGEN, the Carbon Compounds, are divided into HYDRO- 
CARBONS, the fats which are burned in the body, yielding heat, vital 
forces, etc., and CARBOHYDRATES, the fat producers, Avhich include 
sugars, starch, gums, dextrin, etc., containing less carbon, but Hydro- 
gen and Oxygen in right proportion to produce water. ASH, the Min- 
eral Elements, as Salts, Lime, Phosphorus, Sulphur, etc., supplied espe- 
cially by vegetables, are required for the bones, blood, nerves, etc.
