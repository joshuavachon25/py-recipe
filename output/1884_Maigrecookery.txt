MAIGRE COOKERY 



MAIGRE COOKERY 



EDITED BY 

H. L. SIDNEY LEAR 



RIVINGTONS 
WATERLOO PLACE, LONDON 

MDCCCLXXXIV 



'F'- i 



3, 




Printed hy R. & R. Clark, Edinburgh. 



-NOTICE. 

Two or three years ago this little book was pub- 
lished containing a good many maigre recipes, 
and it is said to have been useful. It is now 
re-edited in a different shape, and with the 
addition of a good many more, chiefly Italian 
recipes. Some few, not strictly maigre in their 
preparation, have been added, because the 
collection has been found useful, not merely 
for maigre seasons, but for invalids and for 
savoury dinner dishes. There is a very general 
feeling at the present time that English people 
have used more meat food than is either whole- 
some or thrifty, and many of the recipes given 
here are habitually used on the Continent, with- 



VI NOTICE. 



out being at all confined to maigre purposes. 
A dish of eggs, or cheese, or rice nicely cooked, 
would often be real economy, in sparing the 
more costly articles of food, the trouble of 
cooking these other savoury dishes being really 
the obstacle which often alone seems to hinder 
their use. But if people with small households 
in England would take to using them as in 
other countries, we are persuaded, that not only 
would a pleasanter and more wholesome dietary 
be attained, but also real thrift and economy.

MAIGRE COOKERY 

I. — Common Maigre Stock for Soups 

and Sauces. 

Take 2 or 3 lbs. of dry peas (the hard kind), 
wash, and boil them, adding water so as to pre- 
vent the peas from becoming cooked (a bit of 
iron, such as a key, in the pot will prevent their 
softening). Let them boil for some hours, and 
use the broth, filling the pot up with cold water 
as you do so. Then take plenty of carrots and 
onions ; cut the first in pieces, and the onions 
across. Pass them in a stewpan with butter till 
they are half browned, then cover them with 
some bits of parsley roots^ leeks, mushrooms, 
sprigs of parsley, and small white onions whole, 
a very little thyme and mint, a bay-leaf, a carp's 
body (keeping the flesh for stuffing). Moisten 
with a little hot water, and let it simmer over a 
slow fire. In an hour add more hot water, and 

B 



2 MAIGRE COOKERY. 

make a hotter fire. Then take the pot by both 
handles and shake it constantly till the contents 
are coloured, but not burnt or blackened. Then 
mix the pur^e of peas, which ought to be clear ; 
boil gently for an hour or two ; pass through a 
tammy, and clear carefully of all grease. 

2. — Fish Stock for Soups and Sauces. 

Prepare a clear pur^e of split peas, as before. 
Then take the remains of any kind of fish, salt 
or freshwater; put them in a stewpan, with an 
onion with one or two cloves stuck into it, some 
slices of carrot, and a bouquet of herbs, salt and 
pepper ; moisten with half water and half purde, 
add a piece of bread crumb, and a bit of butter. 
Cook well and strain. 

: This stock is a good foundation for almost all 
maigre soups. The addition of some crab shells 
grated or well crushed boiled in it, and then 
(after straining through a cloth) rather highly 
seasoned, will make a good bisque cPkcrevisses^ 
to which no further addition is needed, save 
some croutons fried. 

Again what the French call " roux^^ which is 






MAIGRE COOKERY. 



sometimes called " brown butter " in England, is 
constantly required in cooking maigre dishes. 
It simply consists of 

3, — Boux, or Brown Butter. 

Two ounces of butter, slowly melted in a pan : 
add 3 oz, of flour, and stir with a wooden spoon 
till it becomes of a golden brown. This is 
added to colour soups and sauces. 

4.. — Liaison, or Lea49on. 

What is called a liaison consists of the yolks of 
. two eggs mixed with six or eight tablespoonfuls 
of milk or cream, passed through a sieve, and 
used to unite other sauces. 

5. — Brown Thickening. 

Brawn thickening for sauces is made by melt- 
ing a pound of butter over a slow fire, and care- 
fully taking off the scum. Then pour the butter 
into another stewpan; add a pound of sifted 
flour, mix well with a wooden spoon, and stir 
over the fire till it is of a light brown colour. ' 
Put into an earthenware pan, and use as re- 
quired. 



MATGRE COOKERY. 



6. — ^White Thickening. 

White thickening is made in the same way, 
only, in order to prevent browning the mixture, 
the fire must be kept very slow while baking. 

7. — Pried Bread Crumba 

Fried bread crumbs are prepared by putting, 
say 4 oz. of very stale, fine crumbs into a frying- 
pan, with an ounce of butter, stir with a spoon 
till they are light brown. Then put the crumbs 
on a sheet of paper to clear off the grease, and 
keep till wanted. 

8. — Pish Foroemeat. 

The fish (of whatever kind) must be carefully 
cleared of bones and put through a wire sieve. 
Then mix with butter, in the proportion of one 
half the weight of fish, and the same of bread 
panada (No. 9). Pound these together, adding 
two or three eggs and seasoning. 

9. — Bread Panada. 

Steep I lb. of crumb of bread in lukewarm 
water; wring it in a cloth. Put in a stewpan 
with I oz. of butter and a little salt, and stir over 



MAIGRE COOKERY, 



the fire till it is a iirm smooth paste. Let it 
cool before mixing with other materials. 

This is a necessary foundation for all stuffing 
or forcemeat. 

lo. — Prying Batter. 

To three quarters of a pound of flour add 2 
oz. of melted butter, and two yolks of eggs ; mix 
with a wooden spoon, pouring in about three 
quarters of a pint of warm water, and work with 
the spoon till it be like smooth cream. It must 
stand a while before used, and just before use 
three whites of eggs whipped into froth must be 
stirred lightly in. 

II. — ^Bechamel Sauce. 

Chop two shalots, some parsley, and small 
onions not very finely, into fresh butter. Moisten 
with cream or milk, and boil till the mixture is 
reduced to half. Season with a little salt, pass 
through a tammy into another saucepan, add 
some nutmeg and a little bit of butter rolled in 
floiu:. Stir this sauce over the fire till it is 
smooth, and serve. 



MAIGRE COOKERY. 



12. — Cream Bechamel Sauce. 
(French recipe.) 

Take 2 oz. of butter and 4 oz. of flour \ work 
them together with a wooden spoon ; put into a 
saucepan with a chopped onion, a carrot, a bit 
of celery, sprig of parsley, a bay-leaf, a sprig of 
thyme, pepper, salt, and nutmeg; moisten with 
a pint of milk ; stir over the fire, and let it boil ; 
strain into a basin. When wanted put some of 
this sauce into a saucepan with a few sliced 
mushrooms, and while on the fire stir in cream 
in proportion of one half of the whole quantity. 

13. — Sauce Piquante. 

Slice some onions, a few mushrooms, carrots, 
turnips, and parsley roots, into melted butter; 
sprinkle with a little flour; moisten with any 
wine and maigre stock in equal parts; season 
with salt and spice. Add a handful of roughly- 
chopped shalots, a head of garlic, a tarragon- 
leaf, a bay-leaf, and a sprig of basil thyme. Boil 
for a good quarter of an hour, pass through a 
tammy, and skim ofl'all grease. Then add a few 
whole capers, two pickled gherkins chopped, and 



MAIGRE COOKERY. 



(if agreeable) one or two anchovies well cleaned 
and chopped small Warm the sauce without 
letting it boil It may be served with slices of 
lemon. 

14. — Dutch Sauce. 

Four yolks of eggs to 2 oz. of butter, a table- 
spoonful of cream, a teaspoonful of elder, chili, 
or tarragon vinegar, with pepper, salt, and nut- 
meg. The pan in which these are should be 
put into a saucepan of hot water over the fire, 
and the mixture be stirred quickly with a wooden

radish and six artichokes (cut up). Fry two or

prawns, and olives, keeping the fish for the top.

carrots, etc. This " complicatissima vivanda" 
— "the Queen of all Salads" — may be more 
simply constructed by the omission of one or 
more ingredients, according to the taste or 
economy of those who wish to serve it up. —
