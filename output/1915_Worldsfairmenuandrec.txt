Books of all sorts have been written on and about the art 
and science of cookery — an art that is regarded by many as 
the greatest, certainly the most appreciated one, and the ex- 
ponents of which earn salaries which many artists who use 
color, tones or words to express themselves with, must envy. 
However, no one seems to have thought to construct a book 
like the present volume before. Anyone examining this vol- 
ume will speedily recognize its two main parts. 

The first contains the reproductions from the world's 
most unique and comprehensive "Menu Collection," exhibited 
at the Panama-Pacific International Exhibition, and the sec- 
ond comprises articles based on cookery with recipes to pre- 
pare numerous dishes, and matter pertaining to the art of 
serving the same. 

The first part will appeal to designers and composers of 
menus, offering them suggestions; to collectors of the beauti- 
ful, and to all those who are interested, directly or indirectly, 
in food, and this is the great general public. 

In the second part the persons, private and professional, 
who are engaged in practical cookery and service will be 
mostly interested. This includes, first of all, the plain house- 
wife and the lady of the house; and, if she is foriunate, her 
servants. Then the managers, buyers, stewards, chefs, cooks, 
head waiters, waiters and waitresses of modern hotels and 
restaurants. As these, through their various activities, greatly 
influence the population, it can be stated that, as in the first 
so in the second part, it is again the general public and its 
interests that are involved, and this will naturally make them 
interested parties. 

In offering this really unique and very useful book the 
publishers hope that it will find the favor of the public.

JOSEPH CHARLES LEHXER— THE AMERICAN GASTROXOM 

Wearing the Golden Cross of Merit Awarded Him by the Hotel Men's 

Association o£. Berlin 





INTRODUCTION BY THE AUTHOR 

ULLY twenty-five years have been consumed to 
collect the original menus, from which reproduc- 
tions are given, in this volume. Some of these 
menus are the list of edibles and beverages served 
at some historic occasions, where presidents 
of republics, kings, emperors, diplomats, and other high 
dignitaries of state, or church, have partaken. Very unique 
are some of the menus from banquets given by notable so- 
cieties, fraternities, business mens' associations, etc., in the 
large hotels and clubs throughout the world. All are equally 
interesting to the student of dietetics and to those whose 
profession it is to prepare dinners to conoisseurs and the 
public. 

During his extensive travels on all five continents, the 
author had many rare opportunities in his professional carrer 
to observe and study the various schools of cookery. For 
there are several schools in this art as in all others, although 
it may be said that French cookery predominates, at least for 
public catering. 

It is the aim and object to give the reader of this book all 
possible information and suggestions on basic methods how 
to prepare food, and the science and art of gastronomy and 
subjects related to it. 

Every person should possess some knowledge on these im- 
portant subjects. It is decidedly an advantage to know the 
origin of food products, their methods of preparation and 
selection, and the way to order the same in public places, as 
well as for household purposes. To enjoy a meal thoroughly 
we must know what, when and how to eat. No person can 
learn too much about the welfare and benefits of a good ap- 
petite, a healthy stomach, a proper digestion and pure food. 

It is not necessary to achieve the skill of an Escoffier, Oscar, 
or of another similarly famous chef or maitre d'hotel. It is not 
equally necessary to live on steaks, chops, chicken or squab. 
Delicious and wholesome dishes can be prepared from much 
cheaper, and not inferior cuts. A little knowlelge of cook- 
ing will help to solve the ever-increasing high cost of living. 

Although this collection has been numerously awarded with 
medals and displomas, and exhibited in London, Paris, Berlin, 
Vienna, Rome, Cairo, New York, Boston, St. Louis and Den- 
ver, never before was there an opportunity to buy copies of 
the originals. It is a great satisfaction to the author to see 
his work published here in San Francisco. A city noted the 
world over as a mecca of epicures and gourmets, and a habitat 
of lovers of good eating and drinking. A matter which greatly 
contributes to the artistic, romantic and jovial temperament 
of San Franciscans.

Electric Cooking 

Gives Best 

Results 

The Convenience, Low 
Cost, Even Heat and Clean- 
liness of Electrical Cook- Type S-3 G. E. Range 

ing Appliances makes cooking by electricity the ideal method for 
every home. 

Tasty Recipes Can Be Most Appetizingly Prepared on 
Electric Stoves and Utensils. 

In addition to that there are no disagreeable fumes, no soot nor 
smoke, and an absolute absence of danger. All surfaces of both 
utensils and heating plates keep perfectly clean. 

The same steady, even heat whether high or low, is maintained 
at all times, so that the cooking of any recipe may be accurately 
timed. 

Prof. Lehner uses electric stoves and utensils exclusively because 
of their convenience, low cost and absolute cleanliness.

necessities to accomphsh anything in the art 
and science of cookery. 

The housewife must devote some time 
daily for this purpose, (iroceries, meat mar- 
kets and bakeries are usually in the neigh- 
borhood, so that not much time can be lost 
in buying food. A few hours a day set aside 
for the preparing of the dinner or lunch will 
leave am])le time for the other general house- 
work, even sutTiciont time to go to matinei's 
or for sho|)ping purposes, and other recrea- 
tions and pleasures. The better situated lady 
who is fortunate enough to be able to kcej) 
servants, will, of course, enjoy this conveni- 
ence; however, the supervision of cookery 
should remain directly imder the manage- 
ment of the lady of the house, rich or poor. 

To give an example in extraordinary pati- 
ence, we will mention that displayed by the 
famous monks of the Chartusian Order, who 
made "Chartreuse" known the world over. 
How do they make this delicious cordial? 
The secret is nothing hut their extraordinary 
patience; it required years and years to 
perfect the recipe for this famous and 
aromatic liquor, which consists of the es- 
sence of carnation, abstintions and the 



young buds of the pine trees. With these 
three ingredients the monks toiled from year 
to year to obtain this elixir of life from the 
crystal drops which fell slowly from the old- 
lasiiioiud distilling apparatus.

111 tlu' st'Irc'lioii and scrviiiiJi of a diiiiu'r 
llu-ix' is just as imicli care rcquirt'd as there 
is in its preparation. It is necessary to know 
wiiat sort of food is in season, whicli should 
be always preferable, jjarticularly in fish, 
i>anie and fowl. The average dinner of today 
consists of relishes; of soup, cither a con- 
soniine (clear soup) or a thick soup; one 
kind of fish; our entree; a sherbet; one roast, 
either with vegetables, or if preferred, with 
salad, but cither one may be served as a sep- 
arate course; one or two sweet dishes, such 
as pudding or ice cream; fruit, cheese and 
cofi'ee. A dinner like this can be ])rci)ared 
very elaborately, and of course much de- 
])ends on the skill of the cook. 

In choosing the various dishes which shall 
constitute the dinner there shall be as much 
variety as possible, each course should be dis- 
tinct and different in taste and preparation. 
Beginning with relishes there are various 
kinds, such as the ])lain American relishes, 
consisting of salted almonds, green or ri|)e 
olives, celery or radishes. Many people pre- 
fer the so-called F'rench hors d'oeuvres, 
which are very appetizing and much liked 
by the cultivated diner. These consist of 
several well seasoned and spiced dishes, 
served nicely arranged, on one tray. Very 
apprnjjriale for this particular course are 
sar.Iines, sausages, herring salad, hard boiled 
cr.gs or sliced calf's head with vinaigrette 
dressing, smoked salmon, anchovies, West- 
phalian ham. mayonnaise of fish, stuffed cel- 
ery, tomatoes buttered with caviar. For 
more elaborate dinners you might select a 
Russian buffet. Most suitable for such pur- 
poses are caviar, pate de foie gras, salami, 
anchovy, sardines on small diamond- 
shaped toast spread out on a large plat- 
ter. The Russian buffet is usually served 
with the cocktail or sherry in the assembly 
room of the guests and not at the dining- 
room table. During the summer time fruit 
is greatly favored before the souj). served 
very cold. Grape-fruit, cantaloupe, melons, 
strawberries or a combination of several of 



tliosc fruits and mi.xed with some licfuor arc 
greatly favored. 

There is another <lish which can be served 
before the soup- that is oysters or clams and 
a glass of Chablis served with this course 
will greatly bring out that distinction that 
liosts and hostesses like to show so much. 
The soup may be served clear, or thick; when 
clear, in cups. 

In preparing the fish, entree and roast, see 
that each is prepared in a different way, 
either with a sauce or saute style. If the 
fish is boiled, then see that the entree is with- 
out any rich sauce, nor stewed or boiled. 
With the fish you might suggest a glass of 
sauterne. 

The difference between the entree and 
roast should at all times be the color of the 
meat. If you serve chicken or turkey as 
roast, you select a dark meat for entree. For 
instance, filet Mignon or Noisette of lamb. 
If the roast is dark meat, such as game, you 
select white meat for the entrees — sweet- 
bread, supreme of chicken an<l veal give you 
si)lendid material for delicious entree dishes. 
If you choose an entree dish of dark meat, 
serve claret or Bordeaux wines. If you choose 
white meat as entrees, serve Rhine or Mo- 
selle wines. With the roast is usually served 
the chami)agne. 

Siiould there be another course between 
the entree and roast, which is known as 
gross piece or joint, for instance, a saddle 
of lamb, a glass of Burgundy is the most 
suitable wine to be served with it. 

With the dessert, you have two choices of 
dessert wine — either port wine or Tokayer. 
Cordials and brandies are served with the 
coffee. 

The success of a dinner depends largely on 
the aforesaid details — the accuracy of service 
is essential, while the one in charge must 
at all times see to it that everything, which 
is to be served hot, is hot, while those dishes 
which are supposed to be served cold, are 
cold, and not kept standing for .some time in 
the hot kitchen.

THE TABLE 

No silent educator in tlie liousehold lias 
higher rank than the table. Surrounded 
three times a day by the family, who gather 
from their various callings and duties, eager 
for refreshment of body and spirit, its im- 
pressions sink deep, and its intluences for 
good or ill form no mean part of the warj) 
and woof of our lives. Its fresh damask, 
bright silver, glass and china, give beautiful 
lessons in neatness, order and taste; its dam- 
ask soiled, rumpled and lorn, its silver dingy, 
its glass cloudy and nicked, annoy and vex 
at first, and then instill their lessons of care- 
lessness and disorder. 

An attractive, well onlered table is an in- 
centive to good manners; and being a place 
where one is inclined to linger, it tends to 
control the bad habit of fast eating. An un- 
inviting, disorderly table gives license to vul- 
gar manners, and encourages that haste 
which has proven so deterious to the health 
of Americans. It should therefore be one of 
our highest aims to bring oiu' table to perfec- 
tion in every particular. 

To this end cleanliness, order and taste 
must be most carefully observed, lieautiful 
damask has no charm if soiled; but be it 
ever so old, worn and darned, if white and 
well-ironed it commands respect. Even 
where no tablecloth can be afTorded, the well- 
scoured pine table is most welcome, and so 
beautiful in its whiteness that we almost 
persuade ourselves it is better than damask. 
Silver has no attraction if dull and tarnished. 
Sticky pitcher and teapot handles, streaked 
china, murky glass, the molasses pitcher 
dotted with hints of its contents, cruets with 
necks and stoppers dingy and thick with 
dried condiments, stray crumbs of bread and 
spatters of gravy in the lumpy salt of the 



smeared salt cellars, are all most repugnant. 
And if, moreover, one knows that a similar 
regime controls the cooking for such a table, 
though the rolls be ambrosia and the coffee 
nectar, they cannot tempt the appetite. But 
the most thorough cleanliness will not atone 
for a lack of order. The tablecloth may be 
clean and white, but unless well-ironed and 
laid straight, it is very unsatisfactory. 

Then taste must come in for its share. The 
selection of silver and china, glass and dam- 
ask, gives fine scope for its exercise. Let all 
be of beautiful design, the damask particu- 
larly, and of as choice a quality as can be 
afforded. "Extravagant!" say you. Then 
can you not dress more simply; and as you 
purchase a rare ])ainting for the refinement 
and cultivation of your children, so furnish 
your table with this beautiful fabric, which 
is a study in its delicate tracery and artistic 
groupings. A fern leaf, a branch of roses, 
or spray of ivy by your child's plate may 
prove in later years to have been its first 
incentive to the study of art. In the appoint- 
ments of the table very much depends on 
refined taste. Without it there may be a stiff 
bouquet in the center, with flowers fitted 
together like stones in a mosaic; with it there 
would be a loose, graceful arrangement of 
flowers, with drooping ferns, leaves and ten- 
drils. Evidences of taste in the table are 
particularly acceptable to us, most deserved- 
ly so, and always worthy of cultivation, as 
they take from the grossness of indulgence 
in mere animal appetite. Let us give, then, 
to these three graces of the table — cleanli- 
ness, order and taste — the importance which 
so justly belongs to them; let us provide an 
abundant supply of wholesome food, well 
cooked and well served, and the hours spent 
at the table shall aid in our education.

HOW TO MAKE SOUP 

Soup is iiKulr llin)iii<li flu' jjrocess of boil-

table soup is preferable. For a family of six 
persons a good size chicken between four

HOW TO CHOOSE EGGS 

III putting the hand round the egg. and 
presenting to the light the end which is not 
covered, it should be transparent. If you 
can detect some tiny spots, it is not newly 
laid, but may be very good for all ordinary 
purposes except boiling soft. If you see a 
large spot near the shell, it is bad, and should 
not be used on any account.

'I'llK MESV AND RF.CIPE BOOK 




Baking — Large fish, such as sahnon, cod, 
lialibut, bass., etc., are generally divided 
into three parts, the head and shoulders, the 
middle cut and tail piece — the two former 
being, as a rule, considered decidedly better 
than the latter, except in the making of fish 
entrees, when the tail piece is often pre- 
ferred. 

Smaller fish, however, whether round or 
flat, when intended for an ordinary dinner 
dish, are usually baked whole. 

First, clean the fish thoroughly, by wash- 
ing it as quickly as possible in cold, well- 
salted water; then dry it carefully with a 
clean soft cloth; season it with salt, pepper 
and lemon-juice; brush it over entirely with 
liquid batter, or ])ure salad oil. Then lay it 
in a well-greased baking tin; moisten with a 
small ([uantity of good white stock, nicely 
flavored witli oyster juice, mushroom cat- 
sup, or lemon juice; cover closely with a 
greased paper and bake in a well-heated, but 
moderate oven, until sutTicicntly cooked — 
basting frequently during the ])roeess, in 
order to render the flesh of the fish tender 
and juicy. The exact time retpured for the 
baking of fish in this way cannot possibly ])e 
fixed accurately. It depends entirely upon 
the size and thickness of the kind thai is 
being used; a very good test, however, is 
to press the fish gently with the finger; when 
the flesh parts easily come from the bono, it 
is done. 

Serve on a hot, neatly folded napkin, or 
a dish-paper, tastefully garnished, and ac- 



companied by plenty of rich, well-nuule 
sauce. 

Flat fish look extremely nice when served 
white side up, the surface being ornamented 
with a pretty arrangement of sifted egg yolk, 
finely chopped parsley, and lobster coral, or 
coralline pepper, and the edge of the dish 
garnished with a full, close border of fresh 
[)arsley. interspersed with fancifully cut 
olives, or quarters of fresh lemons. 

Round fish should be sprinkled over the 
surface with a mixture of fine brown rasp- 
ings, chopped i)arslcy, and sifted egg yolk, 
i\n(\ garnished 'round as above. 

Codfish, fresh haddocks, whiting, etc., are 
often stuffed with a good fish forcemeat, 
previous to being baked, and when this 
method is adopted, care should be taken to 
firmly secure the openings with a needle 
and soft cotton, or fine wool, so that the 
forcemeat cannot escape during the process 
of cooking. The fastenings should, of 
course, be removed before the fish is sent 
to the table. 

The choice in sauces suitable for serving 
as an accompaniment to baked fish is a very 
large one: Anchovy, shrimp, oyster, tomato, 
maitre d'hotel. lobster, dutch, caper, parsley, 
isupreme, Italian, eg£5. melted J)utter and 
fennel sauce; all being more or less popular. 
The two latter are especially suitable for 
serving with mackerel. 

Boiling — When fi.sh is to be boiled, cleanse 
it thoroughly as already directed for baking; 
trim it neatly. If a flat fish, rub the white 
side entirely over with salt and fresh lemon

juice, as this tends to render it still more 
pure in color, and will also remove any un- 
sightly spots which may appear to mar the 
white. Also make a slit down the middle 
of the dark skin, in order to prevent the 
skin on the wliite side from breaking, 
through shrinking a little in cooking. Large 
round lish when cooked whole sliould Ije 
tirmly secured in the shape of an "S" and 
small ones should have the tails drawn 
tiu'ough the eyes and be fastened thus by a 
tiny skewer, so that each may form a com- 
plete ring. Large lish should be firmly 
bound round and round with broad tape, so 
as to secure a neat shape. 

Put just as much water in the lish-keltle 
as will nicely cover the fish, and season it 
well witli salt, and either vinegar or fresh 
lemon juice (an ounce of the former and 
two tablespoonfuls of either of the latter to 
every quart of water) ; then bring il to a boil 
and lay in the lish; watch until the water 
boils up again, then at once draw the fish- 
kettle on one side, and let simmer 'till the 
fish is cooked, regulating the time according 
to the size, kind and thickness. Small or 
very thin fish require to simmer about six 
minutes to the pound; medium-sized fish 
about eight minutes, and thick fish, ten min- 
utes to the pound. 

After the fish is done, never allow it to 
remain in the water, as that will cause the 
fish to loose his fiavor and color. Take it up 
at once, and if it cannot be served immed- 
iately, as it should be, leave it until required 
on the drainer. The latter can quite easily 
be fixed over the boiling water, and covered 
with a thick, soft cloth. 

Dish up neatly on a folded napkin or a 
dish-paper, and garnish as suggested for 
baked iish; or, if preferred, dispense with 
the surface decoration and the napkin, or 
disli paper, and pour over a little of the 
sauce that is being served; garnish the edge 
of the dish tastefully with a border of picked 
parsley, interspersed with cut lemon, prop- 
erly prepared prawns or shrimps, the red 
part of a boiled lobster cut in small, neat 
pieces, quarters of hard-boiled eggs, or any 
other appropriate item, and send to the table 
very hot, accompanied by more sauce in a 
sauce bowl. 



Boiled fish may be served with the same 
kind of sauce as baked fish; a selection can 
therefore be made, in order to save repeti- 
tion, from the list already enumerated. 

Grilling or Broiling — It is not at all dilfi- 
cult to broil lish properly if a reasonable 
amount of care and watchfulness be given 
to tlie task. The essential factors in broil- 
ing are: A clear, moderately hot fire, a scrup- 
ulously clean gridiron, fresh properly pre- 
pared fish, conslt^nt watchfulness and the 
exercise of a little judgment in taking up 
the fish just at the right moment. Given 
these, there is not the least fear but that 
the result will be in every way satisfactory. 

Make the fire, some time before it is Ukely 
to be required, with a mixture of coal and 
coke, both of which shall be broken up in 
rather small pieces; when these are well 
burned through, and smoke or flame still 
appear, throw on a handful of salt, as a per- 
feellj' clear lii'c is indispensable to success- 
ful broiling. Have the grill well rubbed over 
with pure salad oil, or some clarified fat, and 
made thoroughly hot, previous to using. 

In most kitchens, a special gridiron is re- 
served for the cooking of lish, and this is a 
rule good to follow, as any utensil used re- 
peatedly for this purpose, no matter how 
clean it may be kept, soon becomes quite 
unfit for the cooking of anything else. 

Small fish, such as fresh haddocks, gur- 
nets, mullet, trout, mackerel, whiting, fresli 
herring, soles, etc., are all suitable for broil- 
ing whole, though they may be filleted if 
desired, but larger fish should be cut in 
sliced, varj'ing from one to two inches in 
thickness. All round fish can be broiled 
more easily and satisfactorily if they are 
split open and cooked flat. 

Dry the fish thoroughly, whatever kind is 
being used, with a soft cloth and fine flour 
as directed for fried fish; then season it ac- 
cording to taste; brush it over entirely with 
pure salad oil, or liquid butler, and broil it 
very carefully, turning only once during the 
process. 

While the fish is being broiled, keep brush- 
ing it over with a small pastry brush dipped 
in oil or liquid butter. Care must be taken 
not to use too much at a time, or it will 



102

drip into the lire and so cause no end ol' 
annoyance. 

Place tile lish, when cooked, on a very 
hot dish, and pour a little butter or parsley 
(Mailre d'Hotel) over it; then garnish the 
dish tastefully and serve at once. It pre- 
ferred, use, instead, a savoury butler, an- 
chov}', tomato, piniiento, etc. 

Steaming — All kinds of fish suitable for 
boiling are equally good, and in the opinion 
of many decidedly better, when steamed. 
During the latter process, the juices of the 
fish are not drawn out to nearly the same 
extent as in boiling; thus rendering the food 
more nutritious. 

Prepare the lish intended for steaming in 
exactly the same manner as for boiling; tlien 
wrap it in white paper or muslin, wliich has 
been well buttered or oiled; place it in a 
properly shaped steamer; cover with a very 
tightly-filling lid, anil steam over a fast- 
boiling water until suilieiently cooked; that 
is, when tlesh will part quite easily from the 
bone on being gently pressed with the linger. 
When done, remove the wrappings and serve 
the fish prettily garnished, very hot, and ac- 
companied by some carefully prepared sauce 
as previously suggested for baked and 
broiled fish. 

Stewing — Such fish as carp, pike, perch, 
tench, eels, etc., are adapted for stewing, as 
the flesh becomes more tender and richer in 
flavor; but there are several other more deli- 
cate varieties of fish — such as trout, turbot, 
soles, etc., for which this excellent method of 
cooking is to be highly recommended. Care 
being taken, of course, to select the season- 
ings used, and to regulate the time allowed 
for stewing, in accordance with the kind of 
fish being cooked. 

Whatever the variity, have it carefully 
cleaned and properly prepared, and if the 
fish are small, let them remain whole; either 
in their original shape or curled round and 
firmly secured in rings; but if a large kind 
is being used, cut the fish in slices, or in 
pieces of neat size and shape, or have it 
filleted. Then season it lightly with sail, 
pepper and lemon juice, and set it in a cool 
place, while the stock for stewing it in is 
being prepared. 

To do this, put from four to six ounces of 



fresh butter into a stew-pan, with a bunch 
of savourj' herbs — parsley, thyme, bay-leaf, 
and marjoram — tied securely together, a 
small whole onion stuck with three or four 
cloves, half a dozen fresh button nuishrooms 
cup up into slices or small dice, a quarter of 
a pint of fresh tomato pulp, and a sprinkling 
of salt and pepper, and fry together for a 
few minutes over a moderate fire; then add 
three-quarters of a pint of good white stock, 
unflavored, with the rind and strained juice 
of a small lemon, and bring slowly to boil, 
after which, lay in the lish, and let it simmer 
slowly until cooked. 

When done, take up the lish very gently, 
so as not to break it, and keep it hot until 
the sauce is ready. 

Remove the bunch of herbs, onion, lemon 
rind, and then add to the liquid in the stew 
pan one ounce of butter, kneaded smoothly 
with one ounce of fine flour, a pleasant flav- 
oring of anchovy essence, a tablespoonful of 
finely chopped i^arsley, and a little more salt 
and pepper if required, and stir constantly 
over the fire until the sauce has boiled gently 
for two or three minutes, after which pour a 
little of it over the lish and send the rest to 
table in a hot tureen. The edge of the lish 
should be tastefully garnished with suitable 
items, and the whole should be served very 
hot. 

Sometimes the fish intended for stewing, 
after it has been properly cleaned, is fried a 
nice brown previous to being jjlaced in the 
stew pan, in which case, brown stock will be 
preferable to white. 

It will be remenil)crc(l llial the al)()ve 
quantities and ingredients are only given as 
an exanqjle, and nol by any means as a fixed 
rule. Flavoring can be varied in order to 
suit incUvidual tastes, and to be in keeping 
with the kind and ([uanlity of fish wliich is 
being used.

tiiem, closely covered, to draw down gently 
by the side of the fire. Open the oysters and 
put their liquor into another stew pan with 
the wine, white sauce, anchovy essence, and 
lemon juice, and bring slowly to boil, 
stirring constantly; then draw the pan on 
one side, add the egg yolks and tiie cream, 
and continue stirring for two or tlu'ee min- 
utes longer, until the eggs are just ligtly set, 
taking great care to avoid boiling point. 
When ready, strain the sauce into the stew 
pan containing the mushrooms, add the 
oysters, cut up in tiny pieces, stir until the 
whole is thoroughly hot, and serve. 

White Sauce — Fry together very lightly, 
three ounces of fresh butter and two ounces 
of flour; when the mixture is thoroughly 
cooked, but still perfectly colorless, add a 
half pint of milk, a quarter of a pint of 
cream and a seasoning of salt and white 
pepper and stir constantly, and in one direc- 
tion, until the sauce boils, when it is ready 
for use. If it is to be served simply as 
"W^hite Sauce," flavor it pleasantly with tar- 
ragon, lemon juice, vinegar, mushroom ket- 
chup, bay leaves, mace, and an onion stufl'ed 
with tlu'ee or four cloves, etc., just accord- 
ing to taste; but if intended to form the basis 
of some riciier kind of sauce, it is better to 
keep it unflavored. 

Parsley Sauce — Prepare, according to the 
recipe given, three-quarters of a pint of 
melted butter sauce; then stir in two ounces 
of fresh butter, broken up into small bits 
and added one at a time, two dessertspoon- 
fuls of finely chopped parsley, and a table- 
spoonful of strained lemon juice, and con- 
tinue stirring until the sauce boils up, when 
it is ready for serving.

OYSTERS 

Oysters should be kept in a very cold place 
before they are opened, and well washed 
before using, otherwise their appearance 
will be destroyed. They should, according 
to the French custom, be opened on the deep 
shell, so as to better preserve the liquor, then 
laid on linely chopped ice for a short time — 
too long destroys their llavor. While tliej 
should be kept as cold as possible, they 
should never be allowed to freeze, therefore 
they must only be opened shortly before they 
are needed; for, once frozen, they quickly 
turn sour. The proper way to open tliem is 
to place the deep shell in the palm of the left 
hand, and break them on one side. The Bos- 
ton stabbing knife is preferable for this, but 
if there be none handy use a small block that 
the oyster can lit into, and stab it on the edge 
or even a chopping block and chopping knife 
may be employed in case of necessity. Serve 
six oysters for each person, nicely arranged 
on oyster plates with quarters of lemon and 
brown bread and butter, thinly sliced. 



BAKED OYSTERS 

After opening them carefully so as to pre- 
serve the liquor, and removing the beards, 
put the fish into a basin with a sprinkling 
of salt, pepper and fresh lemon juice, and 
set them in a cool place for half an hour. 
Make all ready in the usual way, and in ac- 
cordance with the size of the dish that is 
being prepared, the requisite quantity of rich 
creamy while sauce, using milk or thin 
cream, to which the strained oj'ster liquor 
has been added; then stir into it a pleasant 
seasoning of anchovy essence, the beaten 
yolks of two or more eggs, a light sprinkling 
of fmely-choj)i)ed parsley, and a pinch of 
cayenne and continue stirring until the vari- 
ous ingredients are thoroughly blended with- 
out the sauce again reaching the boiling 
point, when it is ready for use. Butter the 
inside of a silver or fireproof china dish of 
just the right size, and pour in a little of the 
sauce, then arrange upon this a layer of the 
seasoned oysters, cover with more sauce, 
add more oysters, and so on until the ingredi- 
ents arc used up leaving sauce for the top- 



most layer. Sprinkle the surface rather 
thickly with line brown raspings, scatter here 
and there a few tiny bits of butter, and bake 
in a moderate oven until the whole is sizzling 
hot; then serve as quickly and as prettily as 
possible. 

BROILED OYSTERS 

Open them carefully and let the lish re- 
main in the deep shell; remove the beards 
and add to each oyster a pleasant seasoning 
of salt, pepper and fresh lemon juice, and 
a very small piece of butter, then place the 
shells on a gridiron and broil for three or 
four minutes over a clear hot lire. Or, if 
preferred, leave tlie oysters unopened and 
simply brush the shells thoroughly clean and 
dry them well previous to broiling. Be care- 
ful to place the deep shells near the fire. 
When the shells open the oysters are done. 
Serve neatly arranged on a folded napkin or 
dish-paper, tastefully garnished with fresh 
green parsley and accompanied by daintily 
cut bread and butter. 

Deviled Oysters are just oysters broiled in 
their deep shells as already directed, wifn 
the addition of a pinch of cayenne and mus- 
tard. 



OYSTER CROQUETTES AND RISSOLES 

Prepare in the usual way some I'icli thick 
sauce with one ounce of butter, iialf an 
ounce of fine flour, a seasoning of salt, cay- 
enne, anchovy essence, and lemon juice, the 
strained oyster liquor and a quarter of a 
pint of milk. Stir until it just boils; then 
draw the pan on one side and add the oys- 
ters which have been cut into very small 
pieces, and the yolks of two large perfectly 
fresh eggs, and continue stirring by the side 
of the fire for about five minutes longer, 
watching carefully in order to avoid boiling 
point; then spread the mixture out on a tlat 
dish to cool, and when quite cold and firm 
divide it into small equal-sized portions. If 
intended for crocpiettes, form these into 
round balls, or into the shajjs of corks, eggs, 
pyramids, etc., according to taste; dip them 
in beaten egg, coat them lirndy with fine 
bread crumbs and fry them in hot clarified

fat until just nicely brown and quite crisp; 
then drain thorout»hly, pile up neatly on a 
hot dish-paper, garnish tastefully with sprigs 
of fresh parslej' and cut lemon and serve at 
once. If rissoles are preferred, make up the 
preparation either into tiny balls or flat 
round cakes, and enclose each of these, pre- 
vious to frying, within two small rounds of 
light rich pastry, rolled out very thin; jjrcss 
the edges firmly together, after wetting them 
slightly with cold water, then brush the sur- 
face over with beaten egg and sprinkle it 
with fine bread crumbs, after which fry and 
serve as directed for croquettes, the dishing 
up being performed as expeditiously as pos- 
sible, so that the pastry may not have time 
to lose that delicious light puffiness which 
makes the dish so thoroughly enjoyable. 

FRIED OYSTERS 

Procure twenty-four large freshly opened 
oysters, or thirty-six of medium size, dip 
each one separately in fiour, then in beaten 
egg and lastly in powdered cracker dust. 
Frj' in very hot fat for four minutes, drain 
well and serve on a hot dish with a folded 
napkin, sprinkling over a vei'y little salt, and 
garnishing with fried parsley leaves. 



SCALLOPED OYSTERS, OYSTER PATTIES 
AND VOL-AU-VENTS 

First open and beard the oysters, cut them 
in snuill pieces, season with salt, pepper and 
lemon juice, and set them in a cool place 
until required; then make some thick rich 
white sauce with milk to which has been 
added the oyster liquor and when the sauce 
is sutTiciently cooked add the yolks of two or 
more eggs, a flavoring of lemon juice and 
anchovy essence, a light sprinkling of finely 
chopped ])arsley, two or three tablespoonfuls 
of thick cream; add the oysters and stir to- 
gether until the whole is well mixed and 
thoroughly hot, without boiling, then use as 
decided upon. If scalloped oysters are de- 
sired, serve the mixture in shells, either sil- 
ver, china or real, the sur''<\ce being sprin- 
kled \vith a combination of fine brown rasp- 
ings, minced parsley and sifted egg yolk; 
but if patties or vol-au-vents are preferred, 
use dainty little pastry cases which have been 



baked previously, being careful always to 
serve the dish as hot as possible, neatly ar- 
ranged and tastefully garnished. 

Scallops, though closely resembling oy.s- 
tcrs in some points, require a rather dift'er- 
ent method of preparation, as, for instance, 
they should always be very carefully 
cleansed previous to cooking, or they are 
apt to taste gritty; and it must also be borne 
in mind that they require to be cooked very 
slowly and very thoroughly in order to ren- 
der them a wholesome and digestible food. 
Open the shells and remove the fish care- 
fully so as not to tear them, then trim away 
the beards and any black portions, and wash 
the scallops in two or three clean, well-salted 
waters, after which drain them thoroughly 
and stew them just as gently as possible in 
their own licjuor, to which a little stock and 
some suitable seasonings have been added, 
until quite tender, when they may be dressed 
according to any of the recipes given for the 
cooking of oysters. 

Cockles and Mussels are most delicious 
little fish and are not prized so much as they 
deserve to be. Procure them perfectly fresh, 
and after rinsing them in clean cold water 
until the shells arc thoroughly cleansed from 
all sand and grit, put them into a large sauce- 
I)an with only the water that clings about 
them and a sprinkling of salt, then cover 
closelv and shake the pan over a brisk fire 
until the shells open, when the fish are suffi- 
ciently cooked. Turn them out into a col- 
lander so as to drain off the liquid, then pick 
out the fish with a fork; or, better still, with 
clean fingers, and they are ready for serving 
either hot or cold in any of the ways direct- 
ed for oysters, for which they form an ex- 
cellent substitute when the latter are consid- 
ered too expensive, or when they cannot 
conveniently be obtained. 

Shrimps and Prawns, previous to being 
served, should be thrown into fast boiling 
water to which some salt has been added, 
and boiled imtil they change color and are 
sufficiently tender, after which they may be 
sent to the table cold, neatly piled up on a 
dish-paper, garnished with parslev and ac- 
companied by thinly-cut slices of bread and 
butter; or they may be carefully shelled and 
served up in patties, vol-au-vents, scallop

LOBSTER A LA NEWBURG 

Sjjlit two good-sized, fine fresiily l)f)ik'd 
lol)sters. Pick all the meat out from the 
shells, then cut it into one-inch length cual 
pieces. Place it in a saucepan on the hot 
range with one ounce of very good fresh 
butter. Season with one pinch of salt and 
half a saltspoonful of red pepper, adding two 
medium-sized sound truffles cut into small 
dice-shaped pieces. Cook for five minutes; 
then add a wineglassful of good Madeira 
wine. Reduce to one-half, which will take 
three minutes. Have three egg yolks in a 
bowl with half a pint of sweet cream, beat 
well together, and add it to the lobster, 
(leiitly shuffle for two minutes longer, or 
until it thickens well. Pour it into a hot tu- 
reen, and serve hot. 



FROGS A L-ESPAGNOLE (Spanish Style) 
Trim nicely eighteen fine, fresh medium- 
sized frogs' legs; lay the frogs in a soutoire 
on the hot stove with two ounces of good 
butter, season with a i)incli of salt and half 
a pinch of pepper and add half a glassful of 
white wine. Let cook for five minutes, then 
l)ut in half of an empty green pepper and two 
freshly jjceled tomatoes, all cut up into small 
pieces; cook for ten minutes longer, then 
dress the frogs on a hot dish and send to the 
table. 

SALMON SALAD 

One quart of cooked salmon, two heads of 
lettuce, two tablespoonfuls of lemon juice, 
one of vinegar, two of cajjers, one teaspoon- 
ful of salt, one-third of a teaspooiiful of 
pepper, one cupful of mayonnaise dressing 
or the French dressing. Break up the sal- 
mon with two silver forks. Add to it the 
salt, pepper, vinegar and lemon juice. Put 
in the ice chest or some other cold place, for 
two or three hours. Prepare the lettuce as 
directed for lobster salad. .\t serving time 
pick out leaves enough to border the dish. 



(ait or tear the remainder in pieci's, and ar- 
raiigi' these in the cenli'r of a Hat tlish. On 
them heap tiie salmon lightly and covir willi 
the dressing. Now sprinkle on the capers. 
Arrange the whole leaves at the base, and, 
if you choose, lay one-fourlli of a thin slice 
of lenu)n on each leaf. 

LOBSTER SALAD 

Put a large lobster in boiling water 
slightly salted; boil rapidly for about 
twenty minutes; \\hen done it will be of a 
bright red color and should be removed, as 
if boiled too long it will be tough; when cold, 
crack the claws, after first disjointing, twist 
ofl' the head (which is used in garnishing), 
s])lit the body in t\\'o lengthwise, jjick out 
the meat in bits not too fine, saving the coral 
separate; cut up a large head of lettuce 
ard place on a dish over which lay the 
lobster, putting the coral around the out- 
side. For dressing, take the yolks of three 
eggs, beat well, add four tablespoons salad 
oil. dropping it in very slowly, beating all 
the time; then add a little salt, cayenne pep- 
per, half teaspoon mixed mustard, and two 
tablespoons vinegar. Pour this over the lob- 
ster, just before sending to table. 



THE ELECTRIC CHAFING-DISH 

Owing to the fact that grandmother's old- 
fashioiicd kitchen stove is rapidly disappear- 
ing, likewise the large spacious kitchen has 
been substituted with what is known as a 
kitchenette, where stove, pans, pots and soup 
ladles are stowed away behind a folding 
door, the electric chafing-dish is rapidly 
growing in its demand on account of its 
practical, hygienic usefulness, less work and 
proper heat. In course of time it will sub- 
stitute the stove in the kitchen altogether 
and the hostess will be able to cook her din- 
ner at her table right in front of the guests 
in the dining room. Here is a menu of a six- 
course dinner cooked in electric chafing- 
dishes: Onion soup, lobster Newburg, chick- 
en livers with Madeira sauce on toast (make 
toast on electric toasters), tenderloin steak 
with fresh nuishrooms, peas saute in butter, 
pancakes Suzette, coffee in electric perco- 
lator.

Beef. — III the choosing of beef the pur- 
chaser may safely be guided by the follow- 
ing indications: If the meat is really prime 
in quality and in sound condition the lean 
will be close, fine and even in the grain, and 
bright red in color, the fat of a pale creamy 
whiteness and the suet quite firm, the whole 
being cool, pleasant and elastic to the touch. 
Signs the reverse of these go, of course, to 
prove that the meat is either of inferior qual- 
ity or out of condition. Heifer and ox beef 
are I)otli excellent, Init the former is gener- 
ally preferred, as it is so much smaller in 
the bone, and consequently more profitable 
for ordinary purposes; it may also be distin- 
guislied by tlie lean, which is just a shade 
lighter in color and a trifle finer in the grain. 
Cow beef, which is often sold to the unin- 
itiated as heifer or ox beef, is decidedly 
more open in the grain and quite tough wlien 
cooked; while Indl beef, which ought never 
on any account be chosen, is easily recog- 
nized by its extreme coarseness, dark color 
of almost purple liuc, scarcity of fat and 
strong, unpleasant smell. 

The joints intended for roasting should 
be allowed to hang in a cool, airy place, 
the exact time to be regulated, of 
course, in accordance with the season, the 
state of the weatlier and the temperature of 
the larder which is available, but the strict- 
est care should be taken to jirevent the meat 
from becoming, even in the slightest degree, 
tainted — an accident which can f[uite easily 
be avoided if a careful examination of the 
joint is made every day, or even twice a 
day in close, muggy weather. Before hang- 
ing the meat remove the soft pipe which 
runs down the center of the bone in the sir- 
loin or ribs, and trim away any superflu- 
ous fat, as these are the parts which taint 
most readily; and if any spot should acci- 
dentally get fly-blown, rub it over at once 
with a cloth dipped In vinegar, but do not 
wash it. 

.Toints intended for boiling or stewing do 
not require to hang nearly as long as the 
ones for roasting; still, the meat should 
never be just freshly killed, as then, no mat- 
ter what mav be the amount of skill exer- 



cised in cooking, it will be certain to prove 
tough, tasteless, and altogether unsatisfac- 
tory. 

Mutton may be judged according to the 
same rules as beef, only the fat should be 
whiter and not too plentiful. It, too, should 
be well hung if intended for roasting, to in- 
sure its being tender and juicj% but it re- 
quires to be watched with the same care as 
beef, and to have the pipe already mentioned 
carefully removed from the neck and loin 
previous to hanging. 

Lamb, when perfectly fresh and of prime 
([uality, is decidedly paler in color tlian mut- 
ton; the lean is of a clear, delicate pink 
tinge; the fat is firm, white and very light; 
tlie neck veins quite blue; the knuckle stiff 
and springy, and the underneath parts and 
kidney cool, firm and pleasant, as regards 
both touch and smell. Meat showing signs 
different from these should be propmtly re- 
jected, as it is either of inferior quality or 
out of condition. Like all young meat, lamb 
very speedily becomes tained, and will there- 
fore not bear keeping like beef or mutton; 
l)ut in a well-kept, airy larder it may with 
advantage be hung from one to three or even 
four days in the winter previous to being 
cooked — that is. of course, if it is bought just 
freshly killed. 

Veal, it must alwavs be remembered, de- 
teriorates more rapidly than any other meat, 
therefore it should be chosen as soon as pos- 
sible after the animal has been killed. In 
jjurchasing, see that the fiesli is finely grain- 
ed, the fat quite firm and of a pinkish white 
color, and the suet under the kidney per- 
fectly sweet; then as soon as it is sent home 
have the pipe carefully removed from the 
neck or the loin and the skirt from the breast 
previous to hanging, as this helps to preserve 
the meat from becoming tainted, in which 
state veal is one of the most dangerous and 
unwholesome meats known. It should not, 
however, be cooked too soon after being 
killed, or it will be cxceedinglv tough and 
tasteless, so that given a cool, airy larder and 
favorable weather, a joint intended for roast- 
ing mav with advantage be himg for a day 
and a night, or even two days in summer and

Calf's Head, il' ((iiiti' frosli and of good 
(inality, will bo firm, cool and clcaii-skinncd, 
with full, clear eyes. 

Sweetbreads in the same coiidiliou are 
delicately colored, firm, plump and dean- 
looking. Of the two kinds of swcelljreads, 
the heart and the throat, the former are de- 
cidedly to be preferred, being well worth the 
extra cost. 

Pork requires to be chosen with the great- 
est care, even more so than other meats, as 
the pig, from its gluttonous habits, is pai'ticu- 
larly liable to disease. If the following signs, 
however, arc carefully noted there is not the 
slightest danger of mistaking bad for good 
pork, or vice versa: Small, dairy-fed i)ork 
is generally considered decidedly more deli- 
cate and dainty than the larger and moi'c 
ordinary kind of pork, but this, of course, 
is entirely a matter of taste and individual 
requirements, the very small joints being 
altogether out of place in a household where 
the members are numerous and possesesd of 
good healthy appetites; still, both kinds may 
be judged as follows: If young and in per- 
fect condition, the skin will be white and 
smooth, and will feel cool, pleasant and elas- 
tic to the touch, whilst the flesh will closely 
resemble that of veal, being finely grained, 
firm and clean-looking, the pink of the lean 
just tinged with white, and the white of the 
fat just very faintly tinged with jiink. Care- 
fully examine the fat also, and see that it is 
entirely free from small kernels, as the ])res- 
ence of these is a proof beyond dis|)ute that 
the pig was not in a state of perfect health 
when killed. 

A Suckling Pig, to be eaten, in perfect con- 
dition, should not be more than three weeks 
old, and it should be cooked as soon as pos- 
sible after being killed, as it loses in flavor 
very rapidly, and if kept longer than is ab- 
solutely necessary the crackling can never 
acquire that delicious crispness which ren- 
ders the dish so highly esteemed and so thor- 



oughly t'HJoyable. 

Ham and Bacon, when of prime ([uality 
and ])roperly cured, are fine in the grain, the 
lean being of a clear, bright pink, and the 
fat ([uite firm and white; but if, on the con- 
trary, the lean is of a very dej) dark red, it 
shows that the meat is either of inferior qual- 
ity or that it has been oversalled; while yel- 
low streaks in the fat prove that the meat 
has turned rusty through imperfect curing, 
and will, in consequence, have a very strong, 
disagreeable taste when cooked. Another ex- 
cellent test is to run a clean, bright skewer 
or a very fine |K)intcd knife in close by the 
bone ,and if this comes out still clean and 
smelling quite pleasantly, it may be taken 
(or granted, other jioints being equally satis- 
factory, that the meat is all one could rea- 
sonably desire. 

Venison should be very fine and close in 
the grain, with fat of a creamy whiteness. 
Of the three kinds, red deer or Irish venison, 
roebuck or Scotch venison, and fallow deer 
or English venison, the latter is by far the 
best, and when carefully preserved and skill- 
fully cooked, the dish undoubtedly deserves 
to the full the great value set upon it by 
epicures. The flesh of the buck is usually 
esteemed more highly than that of the doe, 
but neither should on any account be eaten 
out of season. Like beef and mutton, veni- 
son requires to hang for a considerable time 
in a cool, airy place previous to being cooked, 
in order to render the meat rich, lender and 
juicy; but as it is an exceedingly dithcult 
meat to keep in proper condition, it should 
be \\'ell dusted over in every part with a mix- 
ture of pepper and ground ginger in equal 
([uantities, directly it comes into the house, 
as a means of keeping off the flies. Examine 
the joint very carefully every day, or even 
twice a day in unfavorable weather, and if 
any doubt is felt as to its condition, test it 
with a skewer or shaip pointed knife in the 
way already directed for testing ham and 
bacon.

FRICASEE OF CHICKExX 

Cut into joints, scald and skin, place in a 
stewpan, with two raw onions cut into eight 
parts, a little chopped parsley, salt and pep- 
per, and the least s(]ueezc of lemon juice. 
Add a bit of butter as large as an egg, and 
fill in a pint of water. Stew for an hour 
under a very close lid, then lift and strain 
off the gravy, into which beat gradually a 
teacupful of cream and the yolks of two 
eggs; heat up the gravy, taking care that it 
does not boil, and i)our it over the frieasee. 

CHICKEN PATTIES 

Mince ciiicken that has been previously 
roasted or boiled, and season well; stir into 
this a sauce made of half a \nn[ of milk, 
into which while boiling a teaspoonful of 
cornstarch has been added to thicken, sea- 
son with butter, about a teaspoonful, and 
salt and pepper to taste. Have ready small 
pate pans lined with good puflf paste. Bake 
the crust in a brisk oven; then fdl the pans 
and set in the oven a few minutes to brown 
very slightly. 



JELLIED CHICKEN 

Boil a fowl until it will slip easily from 
the bones; let the water be reduced to about 
one pint in boiling; pick the meat from the 
bones in good-sized pieces, taking out all 
gristle, fat and bones; place in a wet mold; 
skim the fat from the liquor; a little butter, 
pepper and salt to the taste, and one-half 
ounce of gelatine. When this dissolves, pour 



it hot over the chicken. The liquor must be 
seasoned pretty high, for the chicken ab- 
sorbs. 

CHICKEN SAUTE, HUNGARIAN STYLE 

Singe, draw and cut into twelve pieces, 
two chickens of a pound and a quarter each; 
put them in a sautoire with an ounce of clari- 
fied butter, adding one finely chopped onion, 
half a pinch of salt and half a pinch of pep- 
per, and a teaspoonful of best paprika. Let 
cook slowly, without browning, for five min- 
utes on each side, then moisten with half a 
niiit of bechamel and half a cupful of 
cream. Let cook again for twenty minutes, 
skim the fat oflf and serve with six pieces of 
fried bread croutons around the dish. 

BEEF HEART, BAKED OR ROASTED 

Cut a beef heart in two, take out the 
strings from the inside; wash it with warm 
water, rub the inside with pepper and salt, 
and fdl it with a stuffing made of bread and 
butter moistened with water and seasoned 
with pepper and salt, and, if liked, a sprig of 
thyme made fine; put it together and tie a 
string around it, rub the outside with pep- 
per and salt; stick bits of butter on, then 
dredge flour over and set it on a trivet, or 
muflfiin rings, in a dripping pan; put a pint 
of water in to baste with, then roast it before 
a hot fire, or in a hot oven; turn it around 
and baste frequently. One hour will roast

BOILED TONGUE 

One tongue, a buncli of savory herbs, 
water. In choosing a tongue, ascertain liow 
long it has been dried or pickled, and sikct 
one with a smootii skin, whicli denotis its 
being young and tender. If a dried one. and 
ratiier hard, soak it at least for twelve hours 
previous to cooking it; if, however, it is fresh 
from the pickle, two or tiiree hours will be 
sutlicient for it to remain in soak. Put the 
tongue into a stewpan with plenty of cold 
water and a bunch of savory herbs; lei il 
gradually come to a boil, skim well and sim- 
mer very gently until tender. Peel off tlie 
skin, garnish witii tufts of caulillowers oi' 
brussels sprouts, and serve. Boiled tongue is 
frequently sent to (able with boiled poultry, 
instead of ham, and is, by many persons. 
preferred. If to serve cold, peel it, fasten il 
down to a piece of board by sticking a fork 
through tile root, and another through tlie 
to]), to straigliten it. When cold, glaze il and 
juil a i)ai)er ruche round the root, and gar- 
nisli with tufts of parsley, in rings; between

GRAVIES 

As gravy forms such an iinporlanl ilciu in 
llic onjoynuMit of cortain dishes, it is most 
essentia! that every care sliould he taken in 
its preparation, so that one's appetite may 
not be spoiled by the appearance of tiiat 
highly objectionable mixture of Hour and 
water which is to be seen so frequently. 
Often the best of (hshes are si)oiled by the 
accompanying gravies. To make really 
good brown gravy suitable for almost any 
kind of meat, first of all prepare some rielily 
flavored stock as directed for brown sauce; 
when quite cold and well freed from fat, put 
it into a stew pan with a small quantity of 
brown roux (ecpial (piantities of butter and 
Hour well mixetl over a moderate lire) to 
slightly thicken, a few drops of browning to 
enrich the color, and any extra flavorings 
that may be desired, after which boil up, 
strain and serve. 

When meat has been cooked in the oven 
an excellent gravy can be made as follows: 
Wlien the joint has been removed from the 
tin, pour off all the fat into the dripping 
bowl, being careful to leave all the rich 
brown sediment undisturbed at the bottom; 
upon til's sprinkle a little salt and pepper 
and about a tablespoonful of tlour, and rub 
together very smoothly, then add gradually 
the re(|uisite ([uantity of stock, boil up brisk- 
ly, strain and use. 

For boiled or braised meats use part of 
the liquid in which the meat was cooked 
instead of the stock already mentioned, only 
be careful to see that the gravy is always 
served of just the right consistency and of a 
rich brown color. 



spoonfids of strong stock, and one table- 
spoonful of finely chopi)ed parsley. Put the 
vinegar into a sauce|)an with the stock, \k'\)- 
pereorns, herbs and onion, and boil it gently 
until Hie li(|uid is reduced to about iudf the 
([uantity, then add, oH' the fire, the egg yolks 
and the butter — one of the former and one 
ounce of the latter at a lime — and stir con- 
stantly and briskly until the sauce is thor- 
ouglily hot and of a rich, creamy consist- 
ency, then strain through a hot strainer into 
a hot sauce-boat, and use as required. 

MINT SAUCE

with good boiled vinegar, a little water and 
powdered sugar to taste. 



BORDELAISE SAUCE 

It is a brown sauce, with minced gar- 
lic, ham, shalot, claret wine, cayenne 
pe])i)er and lemon juice. Taki' a J'l'w 
shreds of lean cooked ham, just 
enough for flavoring; mince it fine, 
boil it in a pint of meat gravy. Add. while 
boiling, a bay leaf, two cloves, a niece of 
mace and a pinch of cayenne. In another 
saucepan put a tablespoon of minced onion, 
a clove of garlic, crushed, a spoonful of good 
olive oil; stir over the fire to cook; strain 
the seasoned brown gravy into it, and a cup 
of claret, let it boil down, skimming olf the 
oil, and skim as if apjiears; add lemon juice.

ROASTING 

In the estimation of many people meal 
never tastes so good as when roasted before 
an open fire in the old-fashioned style with 
wiiieli all experienced honsewives are famil- 
iar; but as this method of cooking, in order 
to be a success, requires a considerable 
amount of skill in the management of the 
lire, and involves a little expense in the extra 
consumption of fuel, roasting in a kitchen or 
gas oven is very frequently resorted to in- 
stead. If these ovens are provided \\ith 
proper ventilators, through which the vapors 
given off by the meat may freely escape and 
the general jn-inciples of roasting are care- 
fully carried out, there is no reason at all 
why the result should not be equally satis- 
factory. Which ever way is adopted- an 
open fire or a well-heated oven — the particu- 
lars to be attended to are precisely the same. 
First of all, of course, prepare the fire or 
heat the oven, as the case may be, then get 
the joint ready. Trim the latter very neatly 
and skewer or bind it if necessary into a 
nice firm shape, as, for instance, a stutt'ed 
fillet of veal, a stutt'ed shoulder of mutton, 
rolled ribs of beef, etc.; then expose it to a 
rather high degree of heat so that the sur- 
face of the meat may as quickly as possible 
become seared and just sutiiciently hardened 
to ett'ectually retain the juices. This is done 
in order to preserve the flavor of the meat, 
which would to a very large extent be lost 
if the natural juices were allowed to escapi'. 
Then, just at the right moment, a i)oint only 
to be learned by experience, lessen the heat 
either by lowering the temprature of the 
oven or by drawing the joint a little liniher 
from the fire, and cook more slowly until 
the ])rocess is satisfactorily c;)mpleted. turn- 
ing the joint over if necessary when Iialf 
done. 

Basting is a very important factor in suc- 
cessful roasting, as it tends very largely to 
render the meat rich, tender and more juicy 
than it would otherwise be. It should, there- 
fore, be done very freely and frequently, 
especially in the case of lean meats, which, 
of course, require considerably more basting 
tlian fat meats. 

The exact time which should be allowed 



for roasting can not be correctly stated. Ex- 
perience alone can thoroughly teach this. The 
old-fashioned rule of allowing a cjuarter of 
an hour to the pound and a ([uarter of an 
hour over is only correct in certain cases. 
A safer and more conunon-sense plan by far 
is to judge the joint according to its thick- 
ness rather than to its weight, and also to 
take into consideration the kind of meat that 
is being dealt with. Ten minutes per pound 
is (piite sufficient for the cooking of thin 
joints of beef, mutton or venison, while from 
twelve to fifteen minutes per pound may be 
allowed for thicker ones, with three or four 
minutes extra per pound if the joint is of 
lamb, veal or pork, all young or white meats 
requiring a longer time in order to be cooked 
])roperly than full-grown brown meats. 

The prime joints for roasting are as fol- 
lows: In beef, the sirloin and the ribs, 
lliough the upper part of the round and the 
cluunp end of the rinnj) are also excellent; 
in mutton, the saddle, haunch, loin, leg, 
shoulder, and best end of the neck; in veal, 
the fillet, loin (kidney end to be preferred), 
breast, shoulder and fine end of the neck; in 
jKjrk, the s]nu'eribs, loin and leg; in lamb, 
the fore-quarter, hind-quarter, leg, loin and 
shoulder; and in venison, the haunch, shoul- 
der and best end of the neck. 

In r(jasting meat it is customary to wrap 
file joint after it has been ])roperly prepared, 
in well-oiled or- thickly greased paper, then 
cover it entirely with a stift' paste of flour 
ered with more greased paper securely fast 
and water, which latter must in turn be cov- 
ened on with string, after which it is cooked 
according to the directions already given, 
until about half an hoiu' previous to being 
done, when all the paper and paste must be 
carefully removed, the joint dusted over with 
fine flour mixed with salt, and freely basted 
for the remainder of the time. 

When the cooking has been satisfactorily 
accomplished take up the joint and remove 
the skewers or other fastenings, substituting 
hatelets, or pleated skewers, if such are 
available, then place it neatly on a very hot 
(h'sh. pour a little rich brown gravy round 
about, garnish appropriately, and serve with 
suitable accompaniments.

THE MENU AND RECIPE BOOK 



Roast beef may be garnished just simply 
with freshly scraped horse radish and sprigs 
of parsley, or with small baked tomatoes, 
whole mushrooms, braised vegetables, such 
as celery, button onions, leeks or salsilies, 
etc.; just according to taste, and it should be 
accompanietl by more rich brown gravy in 
a gravy boat, small neat squares of York- 
shire pudding, dished up tastefully on a hot 
tlish-paper, and garnished with sprigs of 
fried parsley, and either horse-radish, es- 
pagnole, brown mushrooms o rtomato sauce 
in a hot tureen. 

Roast mutton, also, may be garnished with 
daintily cooked tomatoes or mushrooms, or 
both, the items being arranged alternately 
with a sprig of parsley between each, or it 
may be served with simply a little rich 
brown gravy poured round about, more 
gravy being sent to table in a gravy boat, 
with either soubise,, brown caper, brown 
mushroom or tomato sauce in a tureen, and 
red currant jelly as an accompaniment. 

Roast kunb is extremely nice if dished up 
with a properly prepared cucumber garnish 
and served with good brown gravy and cu- 
cumber sauce; or, if preferred, the joint may 
be garnished round with daintily fried potato 
croquettes, cauliflower spi-igs dipped in hot 
butter, and lightly sprinkled with salt, pep- 
per and finely minced parsley, or a nice bor- 
der formed of tiny heaps of some carefully 
cooked green vegetables, artichoke bottoms 
skillfully prepared and filled with peas or 
beans which have been well boiled, then cut 
fine and sauted, or with a mushroom puree 
interspersed with slices of cooked tomato, 
etc., and be accompanied by rich brown 
gravy and mint sauce; or, again, if a plainer 
dish is required, roast lamb is excellent when 
served with the gravy and mint sauce only, 
a little of the former being poured round 
the joint. 

For roast veal the most i)()])ular garnisii- 
ing is com|)()sed of small, dnintily-fried 
forcemeat balls, slices of fresh lemon, curli'd 
bacon and sprigs of parsley, and the most 
favorite accompaniments are brown gravy 
with tomato, pi(|uanle, bechamel, while 
musiu'oom jjrovencale or espagnole sauce. 

Roast i)()rk may, if liked, be garnished 
round with tiny heaps of sage and onion 
stufiing, slices or quarters of fresh lemon 



and sprigs of parsley, or it may be dished 
up with just a little brown gravy poured 
round about, but in either case it should be 
accompanied by more hot gravy in a gravy 
boat and one or other of the following 
sauces: Piquante, tomato, apple, soubise, 
sage and onion, or provencale. 

Roast venison is not generally garnished 
unless it be so with French plums wiiich 
have been cooked in claret; it sliould be 
served just as hot as possible, acconqjanied 
by brown gravy and red currant jelly, and 
either piquante, poivrade or port wini' sauce. 

ROAST LOIN OF MUTTON 

Loin of mutton, a little salt. Cut and trim 
oir the superfluous fat, and see that the 
butcher joints the meat projjcrly, as thereby 
much annoyance is saved to the carver, when 
it comes to the table. Have ready a nice 
clear fire, put down the meat, dredge with 
flour, and baste well until it is done. 
ROAST FOREQUARTER OF LAMB 

Landj, a little salt. To obtain the flavor of 
hunb in perfection it should not be kept 
long; time to cool is all that is required; and 
though the meat may be somewhat thready, 
file juices and flavor will be infinitely su- 
perior to that of lamb that has been killed 
two or three days. Make up the fire in good 
time, that it may be clear and brisk when 
the joint is put down. Place it at sufficient 
distance to prevent the fat from burning, 
and baste it constantly till the moment of 
serving. Lamb should be fhorougiily done 
without being dried up, and not the slightest 
appearance of red gravy should be visible, 
as in roast mutton; this rule is applicable to 
all young white meats. Serve with a little 
gravy made in the drijjping pan, the same as 
for other roasts, and send lo table with a 
tureen of mint sauce. 

ROASTED FRESH PORK 

Take three pounds of fresh loin of pork, 
season two hours before needi'd with two 
good i)inches of salt and one good pincli of 
p( pix'r, well (iislributed. Put it into a roast- 
ing pan willi lialf a eui)f'nf of water, place it 
in (lie oven and let roasl for fully one and a 
linlf hours, being careful lo baste it fre- 
(|ueiilly \\\[\\ its own gravy. RenioNc il fo a 
liot disli, skim tiie fat from tJie gravy, strain 
the lean part over the roasl, and serve. 



THE MENU AND RECIPE BOOK

As the gt'iuTiil jirinciples of roasting, boil- 
ing, braising, grilling and Trying have al- 
ready been explained, a repetition of these 
would be superfluous. The same rules apply 
to the cooking of poultry of all kinds and 
the larger varieties of game, such as pheas- 
ants, partridges, grouse, rabbits, hares, deer 
joints, venison steaks, etc. 

When neatly trussed for boiling or roast- 
ing, or cut in pieces for grilling or frying 
(a part of the business which the poulterer 
should always be asked to perform, unless 
the cook is thoroughly experienced), stuff 
witli some good suitable forcemeat (see page 
— ) or not, just according to taste, and cook 
as already tlirected. When done, dish up 
neatly on a nice hot dish and serve with 
either of the following sauces: 

For boiled or braised capons, chickens, 
fowls and turkeys, the most popular sauces 
are oyster, white mushroom, celery, becli- 
amel, chestnut and parsley butter, the choice 
of course being in harmony with the force- 
meat, if it is being used; for ducks, geese 
and rabbits a well-made soubise sauce; for 
partridges, pheasants and grouse, soubise, 
liver, horse-radish, celery, bechamel, or 
white mushroom sauce; and for a braised 
hare, which forms a very favorite dish, with 
those who know it, espagnole, brown mush- 
room, poivrade, or provencale sauce. The 
edge of the dish should be garnished taste- 
fully with slices of fresh lemon and sprigs 
of parsley, and with a capon, chickens, fowls, 
turkeys or rabbits, a small well-boiled and 
jn-ettily garnished ham, tongue or piece or 
prime bacon should be served as an accom- 
paniment. A little of the sauce should al- 
ways be poured over the birds or the joint. 



as llu' ease may be, and more sent to table 
in a hot tureen. 

With roast capons, chickens, fowls and 
turkeys serve oyster, chestnut, espagnole, 
egg, or bechamel sauce, as well as rich brown 
gravy and bread sauce; garnish round the 
edge of the dish with a tasteful arrangement 
of curled bacon, sliced lemon, small forci- 
meat balls and sprigs of parsley, or with a 
ring of nicely cooked pork, or veal and ham 
sausages, sprigs of parsley and cut lemon. 
With roast ilucks or geese, serve rich brown 
gravy and apple sauce, the edge of the dish 
being garnished with slices of fresh lemon 
and sprigs of parsley. Serve bread sauce, 
browned bread crundjs, and game gravy 
with roast partridges, pheasants, grouse, 
])tarmigan and black game, and garnish the 
dish with fresh, crisp watercress which has 
been well washed, thoroughly dried and sea- 
soned with salt, pepper, salad oil and tarra- 
gon vinegar or fresh lemon juice. With roast 
rabbit or hare serve espagnole, piquante, 
poivrade, provencale, reforme, port wine, or 
liver sauce, and garnish the dish with curled 
bacon, balls of forcemeat and sprigs of pars- 
ley; or, if preferred, garnish with watercress 
prepared as above, and serve with warm red 
currant jelly and game gravy. 

Spring chickens, ducklings and goslings 
are not generally stuffed, as the natural 
flavor of the bird is so very delicate and 
delicious that no addition is needed. They 
should be very carefully prepared, trussed 
and roasted and be sent to table as hot as 
possible, garnished with watercress pre- 
pared as directed for ]jartridges, etc., and 
accompanied by any of the sauces, etc., 
recommended for older birds of the same

THE MEM AM) UECIPE liOOK 



xarit'ty. 

When poultry or i»;iiiH' has bt'cn cut into 
joints or pieces and been grilled or fried it 
should be dished up as I'ollows: If a coaiinij 
of egg and bread crumbs or any other form 
of masking has been used, the surface of the 
meat should, of course, if properly cooked, 
l)e (juite dry and crisp, therefore arrange il 
neatly on a hot dish-paper, garnish taste- 
fully and serve at once with the sauce or 
gravy (if such is recjuired) in a hot tureen; 
but if just seasoned and plainly fried or 
grilleil, pour tiie gravy or sauce over the 
meat, garnish with ap])ropnate items, ar.d 
serve very hot. Any of the sauces, gravie.^ 
or garnishes recommended for roast game 
or poultry are equally suitable when the 
meat has been grilled or fried. 

The smaller varieties of game, such as 
woodcock, snipe, quails, teal, ortolans, plov- 
ers, widgeon, etc., should be cooked and 
served as follows: Pick the birds very care- 
fully, as the skin tears so easily, and truss 
them firmly, but <lo not draw them, the trail 
or intestines being considered the daintiest 
part of the whole. Rub them over entirely 
and very liberally with good fresh butter, tie 
strips of thinly-eul fat or bacon over the 
breasts and roast before a clear hot fire from 
fiifteen to twenty minutes, small game being 
generally preferred slightly uiuk'rdone. Place 
some pieces of toast under the birds so as 
to catch the trail as il drops during the pro- 
cess of cooking, and baste frequently by 
brushing the birds over with a brusli dip])ed 
in liquid butler, or clarified fat, instead of 
pouring the fat over them in the usual man- 
ner, as this latter metiiod would completely 
spoil the toast, which is generally regarded 
as one of the tit-bits of the dish. When 
done, serve the birds upon the toast, the lat- 
ter being neatly arranged on a vei'y hot disli; 
garnish with seasoned watercress and sent! 
to table witii port wine, espagnole, or 
piquante sauce, or bread sauce, browned 
liread crumbs and game gravy as accompa- 
niments. 

Never wash poultry or game, witli tlie ex- 
ce])ti()n of rabbits and hares, unless abso- 
lutely necessary; jusl rub them gently bul 
thoroughly, ins'de and outside, with a clean 
(lamp cloth, which is a decidedly better meth- 
od, washing being very liable to detract from 



the tlavor. Habbils and hares, however, are 
Ihought by some people to be improved by 
being soaked for a sliort time previous to 
cooking, either in tepid water or ccjual parts 
of milk and water. But this, of course, is 
entirely a matter of opinion, as others again 
think just the reverse. 

ROAST RABBIT 
Empty, skin and thoroughly wash the rab- 
bit; wipe it dry, line the inside with sausage 
meat and force meat (the latter of bread 
crumbs, \\ell seasoned and worked uj)). Sew 
the stuOlng inside, skewer back the liead be- 
tween the shoulders, cut off the fore joints 
of the shoulders and legs, bring them close 
to the body and secure them by means of a 
skewer. Wrap the rabbit in bultered paper, 
keep it well basted, and a few minutes be- 
fore it is done remove the paper, tlour and 
froth it, and let it acquire a nice brown color. 
It sliould be done in three-quarters of an 
hour. Take out the skewers and serve with 
brown gravy and red currant jelly. To bake 
llu' rabbit, procied in the same manner as 
al)o\e; in a good oven it will take about the 
same time as roasting. 

ROAST TURKEY 
Clean the turkey, rub the inside with an 
onion, or rinse it thoroughly with a pint of 
water in which a teaspoonful of soda is dis- 
solved, then wash clean with cold water; 
crush the point of the breast bone; this will 
give the fowl a fine, round appearand'. Truss 
it as you would a chicken; stulV il with 
bread crumbs, seasoned with pepper, salt, 
herbs and two or three ounces of butter. Lay 
it in a dripping pan, spot it with i)ure lard 
or dripi)ings, put three gills of water in the 
pan, and baste very often. When the breast 
is nice and brown protect it with a sheet of 
white paper. Boil the giblets, chop tlu'in 
fine and add them to the gravy, which may 
be made in the drii)i)ing pan wlieii the tui- 
key has been taken out. If there is too much 
fat, pour it off before putting in the giblets, 
and if too little gravy, add a little soup stock 
if on hand, otherwise watir. Phieken and 
season to taste. Pour sonu' of il around llic 
turkey and serve the rest in a howl. Tliiii 
slices of ham or bacon fried cris]) may be 
curled and laid around the turkey. Stewed 
cranberries or stewed a])ples should be 
served with it.

SARATOGA POTATOES 



Pare tho potatoes, slice tluiii tliin as pos- 
sible on the potato cutter, leave them lor an 
hour or an hour and a half, in cold water, 
then tlry them in a towel. Have a kettle of 
deep lard for frying them. When it is hot, 
cover the surface with the dried slices. Sprin- 
kle a little salt over them, turn tiiem with 
the skimmer and when done lay them on a 
doubled brown paper in the open oven. Fry 
them all in this way, piliui" them u]) on liie 
jjaper as they come from the lard. Tliey 
are eaten both hot and cob! for break!'; si, 
lunch or tea, sometimes with a fork or 
oflener with the fingers. 



NEW ORLEANS POTATOES 
Pare and cut the potatoes in tiH-ee-(|uarter 
inch dice. Leave them in water as in liie 
above recipe; drain, dry and cook them in 
the same way, giving them, howevei', a lillle 
more time. A cpiarter of an onion (li()i)pcd 
in the hot lard im])arts a line llaxoi' lo Ihi' 
l)otatoes. 



SCALLOPED POTATOES 

Slice cold boiled potatoes very thin and 
small. Put one quart of them in a |)an in 
layers with two even teaspoonfuis of sail, 
two-thirds of a teaspooul'ul of pej)per. and 
two and one-half ounces of butler. Pour 
half a pint of cream over the whole; if milk 
is used, more butler is retjuired. Cover Ihe 
potatoes with grated bread, a little jjepper 
and salt and small bits of butter. Biikv until 
thoroughly heated and brow nt'd. 

POTATOES A LA PARISIENNE 

Cut raw potatoes with a vegetable cutter 
into balls the size of a marble. Fry them 
brown in butter. Season with a liltk' pei)i)er. 
salt and chopped parsley. 



Two teasijooid'uls of salt. 

Half a small nutmeg, grated. 

Two eggs. 

A small pinch of cayt'une i)ep])er. 

Mix the butter with the potatoes wiiile 
warm. Use the cream to helj) pass the po- 
tato through the colander. Add the salt, 
l^epper, nutmeg and one beaten egg. Mix 
all tiioroughly together, then make up into 
rolls about four inches long and one and one- 
half inches Ihrougli; or make them round 
and llatfen Ihem, but be very careful to have 
the surface perfectly smooth. Beat the egg 
on a plate, have the bread grated very line, 
rolled and sifted cracker will do, but which 
ever is used it must be fine as coarse corn- 
meal to insure a beautiful crust. Roll the 
cnxpiettes lirsl in Ihe egg and then in the 
bread. Lay lluin in the basket and plunge 
it in the hoi lard. When a light brown lay 
the croquettes on browned pa|)t'r for a nio- 
nu'iil. Ilu'u serve on a na])kiw. 



MASHED POTATOES 

P'our pounds of |)eeled raw ])otatoes. 

Six ounces of butter. 

One and one-half gills of milk. 

One and one-iialf tablespoonfuls of sail. 

Boil the potatoes, pour ofi' the water, mash 
ihem with the potato ])ounder, add the milk, 
butter and salt and beat until all are not 
only thoroughly mixed, but light. Cream 
may be used instead of milk, and ihe ((uan- 
lity of butler lessened. 

POTATO AS RICE 
Di'ess the potatoes as in the above recipe, 
and rub them quickly through the colander 
into a hot vegetable dish. The puree must 
Piot be touched, but allowed to lie just as it 
falls from the colander. Serve at once. 



POTATO CROQUETTES 

Oni' and one-half pomids ol' polalocs 
])assed Ihrough the collander. 
Three ounces of grated bread. 
Two oimces of butter. 
Half a gill of cream. 



POTATO BROWNED IN SLICES 

WHiat remains of the mashed potato after 
dinner may be pressed evenly in a basin, and 
the next morning cut in slices half an incli 
thick and fried a light brown on the griddle, 
or browned in the oven.

THE MENU AND RECIPE BOOK 



Slice cold boiled potatoes lengtlnvisc. The 
slices should not be less than half an inch 
thick. Broil them on the gridiron on botli 
sides. Lay them in a hot vegetable disii. 
sprinkle with a little salt and pepper and put 
bits of butter over them, to be served very 
liot. 



POTATOES FRIED WHOLE 

Select small ones of uniform size. If this 
cannot be easily done, cut them down to the 
proper size (the surplus bits may be boiled 
and mashed for baUs and croquettes), boil 
them until nearly done in salted water, then 
lay them in the frying basket and plunge it 
in deep hot lard. If preferred, they may be 
dipped in egg and grated before frying. 



BAKED POTATOES 

Wash them well with a brush to get every 
l)article of grit from the eyes, then rinse 
them in clear water; lay in the oven and 
bake half an hour. They should be served 
inmu'diatelv. 



POTATOES LYONNAISE 

Slice cold boiled potatoes, fry them, add- 
ing s;dt, pepper, half an onion grated and a 
little parsley chopped fine. 



SWEET POTATOES 

Boil or bake them like Irish potatoes, but 
give them more time. If boiled they must 
be pared before serving. Cold sweet pota- 
toes are verv nice cut and fried. 



FRYING (French) 

The secret of accomplishing this work to 
perfection is to have the lard so deep that it 
entirel}' covers what you wish to fry, and so 
hot that it will instantly form a crust over 
the entire surface of the article that is being 
fried. If further cooking is necessary, the 
heat must be reduced. Says Savarin: "In 
frying, when once the surface has bei'u af- 
fected, lower the fire a little, so that the 
stewing of the interior particles may not be 
too <[uiek, and in order that the gradual heat 
may better bring out the taste." By this 
mode we avoid the fat-soaked, unwholesome 
dishes which are so often the result of not 



paying attention to this very important 
point. 

The best frying is done by plunging the 
article entirely in boiling fat. How often 
do we see fried potatoes or soles mere slices 
of something softened in grease? Boiling 
grease does not enter articles plunged into 
it, but forms a crust on their surface, which 
keeps it out. A well-fried sole will hardly 
soil the napkin on which it is laid. Either 
lard or drippings may be used for this pur- 
pose. Test the heat with a bit of bread an 
inch square; if it browns in one minute the 
heat is right. 



Be certain to have the vegetables fresh; 
wash and examine them very carefully, to 
be sure that they are free from grit, insects 
and worms. Let them lay in cold water half 
an hour or more before using. 

As there is no English word to tlescrijje a 
substance that has been rubbed through the 
collander, or pounded to a pulp, the F"rench 
word puree will be used occasionally in the 
following recipes. 

W'here cream is used with vegetables, 
milk slightly thickened with an additional 
bit of butter may be substituted. 
Spinach 

Look it over carefully and wash it thor- 
oughly, take it from the water, put it in a 
saucepan without water, cover closely and 
boil half an hour. Put it in the collander, 
press all the water from it, return it to the 
fire, cut it sevei-al times across, season with 
butter, salt and pepper. 

It may otherwise, when boiled soft, be 
ruhbed through the collander, then put in a 
saucepan and seasoned with butter, pepi)er 
and salt. When hot, beat in a cupful of rich 
cream. 

Green Peas 

Be sure that they are young, as old |)eas 
aie fit for nothing but soup. Throw (hem 
in boiling water and boil irom thirty lo 
thirty-five minutes. Drain them, sea.son with 
butler, salt and pepper and add a half a gill 
of rich cream. 

Boiled Cauliflower 

Remove the leaves, cut oil" the main stalk 
close to the flower, wash it thoroughly, lay

it ill boiling niiliv and wak'r slightly saltt'd, 
with the stalk down; cover and boil moder- 
ately; when done, lay it in the coUander, 
being very careful not to mar ilie ilower; 
when well drained serve in a vegetable dish 
with the flower up, and pour over it a rich 
drawn butter. 

Lima Beans 

Put one quart of shelled beans into a pan 
of cold water and let them remain one hour; 
put them in boiling water, more than enough 
to cover them; when tender pour off the 
water, add two ounces of butter and half a 
gill of cream, season with salt and pepper; 
let it simmer a few minutes, then serve. All 
siiell beans may be cooked like the above. 
Green Corn, Boiled 

Throw the husked cars in a kettle of boil- 
ing water slightly salted, an«l boil them from 
twenty to thirty minutes. Serve m a nap- 
kin, or boil and serve in the thin inner husk, 
if preferred. 

Corn Fritters 

Six large ears of corn. 

Two eggs. 

Three tablcsijoonfuls of tlour. 

Salt to the taste. 

(irate the corn or cut it off the cob; add 
the eggs, well beaten, the Hour and salt; mix 
well and drop it in hot lard a (piarter of an 
inch (k'e|). When browned on one side, tiUMi 
to tiu' other. Servi' very hot. 
Winter Succotash 

Parboil a pint of beans and throw oif tiic 
water, add one quart of boiling water and 
when they have boiled twenty minutes throw 
in a gill of cold water, and twenty minutes 
afterward throw in another. In this way 
the beans will be cooked in an hour and a 
quarter. Have ready a pound of salt pork 
which has been boiled two hours, and a can 
of sweet corn boiling hot; add them to the 
beans, with two tablespoonfuls of white su- 
gar, three ounces of butter rolled in tlour, 
salt and pepper to taste, and a little water, if 
necessary. Let all simmer together for half 
an hour, then serve very hot. 
Stewed Cabbage 

Slice cabbage as for cold slaw, cover with 
water and stew in a covered saucepan until 
tender; pour off the water, add a bit of butter 



(about two ounces to a dish holding three 
pints), and salt, pepper and vinegar to suit 
the taste; stir it as little as possible, let it 
simmer a few minutes, then it is ready to 
serve. 

Fried Egg Plant 
Cut in thin slices and soak an liour in salt 
and water, two even teaspoonfuls to a quart, 
sprinkle same with a little salt and pepper, 
dredge with Hour and fry on both sides in 
hot drippings or butter. Or, dip the pieces 
in a beaten egg, well seasoned with salt and 
pepper, then in finely grated bread, and fry 
in deep laril in the basket, or as above.

LETTUCE 

The early lettuce arid iirst fine salad are 
five or six leaves in a cluster; their early 
appearance is their greatest recommenda- 
tion; cabbage or white-heart lettuce is later 
and much more delicate; break the leaves 
apart one by one from the stalk and throw 
them into a pan of cold water; rinse them 
well, lay them into a salad bowl or a deep 
dish, lay the largest leaves first, put the next 
size upon them, then lay on the finest white 
leaves; cut hard-boiled eggs in slices or cpiar- 
ters and lay them at equal distances around 
the edge and over the .salad; serve with vine- 
gar, oil and made mustard in the castor. Or, 
having picked and washed the lettuce, cut 
the leaves small; put the cut salad in a gla.ss 
dish or bowl, pour a salad dressing over 
and serve; or, garnish with small red rad- 
ishes, cut in halves or slices, and hard-boiled 
eggs cut in quarters or slices; pour a salad 
dressing over when ready to serve. Serve 
with boiled lobster, boiled fowls or roasted 
lamb or veal. 



COLD SLAW 

Chop or shred a small white cabbage. Pre- 
pare a dressing in the proportion of one 
tablespoonful of oil to four of vinegar, a 
teaspoonful of made mustard, the same 
quantity of salt and sugar, and half as much 
pepper. Pour over the salad, adding, if you 
choose, three tablespoonfuls of minced cel- 
ery; toss up well and put into a glass bowl.

a little juice into the dressing. The juice is 
obtained by first peeling the onion, and then 
grating with a coarse grater, using a good

The best sustainer of health lies in the perfect condition of your teeth. If your 
stomach is out of order and your nerves weak and run down consult your dentist fii-st, as 
one bad tooth will lead to a nervous breakdown and nerves are your foundation of health. 

To any one in need of careful dental work I heartily recommend my dentist, 
Dr. Iloagland. lie has restored my teeth in a perfect condition and I am always glad to 
express my appreciation for the skillful woL-k he did for me, without the slightest pain or 
discomfort.

LEMON JELLY 

One pound of sui<ar. 

One and a lialf jjints of boilini^ water. 

One ounce of isinglass, soaked two iiours 
or more in half a pint of cold water. 

Half a gill of wine. 

The juice and grated rind of three lemons. 

Pour the boiling water on the isinglass, 
stir it. and add the other ingredients; then 
pour it in moulds wet with cold watci". 



WINE JELLY 

One box of Cox's gelatine. 

One and a half pounds of sugar. 

Two quarts of water. 

One pint of wine. 

Two lemons. 

Pour one pint of cold water on the gelatine 
and the rind of the lemons; let it stand an 
hour, then add three pints of boiling water, 
the sugar, wine and lemon juice; strain it 
and put in moulds, which must be placed on 
ice unless the weather is so cold that the 
jelly will stiffen in the open air. 



STRAWBERRY JELLY 

Strain a quart of the acid and warm it 
over a vessel of hot water, adding to it one 
omice of gelatine which has been dissolved 
in as little water as possible; mix well and 
pour into moulds. In hot weather take one 
aiifl a iialf ounces of gelatine. 



ORANGE JELLY 

One pound of sugar. 

Half a pint and about two-thirds of a gill 
of strained orange juice. 

Three gills of boiling water. 

The strained juice of two lemons. 

The rind of two oranges. 

One ounce of Cooper's isinglass. 

Soak the isinglass in cold water two hours, 
taking care that it does not float; boil the 
orange peel in a pint of water until enough 
of the flavor is extracted; this must be de- 
cided by the taste, as some like it quite bit- 
ter. Put the lemon juice in the gill meas- 
ure, fill it up with orange juice, and put it 
with the half pint of juice on the sugar. Take 
the isinglass from the water, lav it for n 
moment on a towel, then pu< it in a two- 
quart basin with three gills froin the water 



boiling with the orange peel; add the sugar, 
etc., stir well and let it heat gradually and 
when just ready to boil strain it through a 
towel, and pour it into moulds wet with cold 
water. 



COFFEE JELLY 

One i)int of clear coffee, as strong as it is 
generally drank, sugar to taste. Pour one 
gill of cold water on half an ounce of Cox's 
gelatine and let it soak fifteen minutes; pour 
off the water and put the gelatine, when well 
dissolved, in the hot coffee; wet a mould and 
pour it in through a strainer. 



ORIENTAL JELLY 

This consists of red and yellow jellies 
placed irregularly in small quantities in the 
same mould with bits of quince. 

One box of Cox's gelatine. 

One and a half pounds of sugar. 

Two quarts of water. 

One pint of wine. 

One slightly heaped tablespoonful of dried 
saffron flowers. 

One and a half teaspoonfids of scoke-berry 
syruji. 

The i)ared rind and juice of two lemons. 

Pieces of canned quince. 

Pour one pint of cold water on the gela- 
tine and let it stand an hour; drain the juice 
thorouglily from the quince and lay the 
pieces in a napkin; add two pints of boiling 
water to the gelatine, the lemon peel and 
juice, the sugar and wine; dissolve Ihorough- 
Iv and let it stand while the saffron steeps a 
few miiuites in two gills of water; then take 
out the lemon peel and divide the jelly in two 
ermal parts, each part now requires two gills 
of water. If the measure of saffron water 
falls short, make it up with boiling water, 
and add it to one-half of the jelly, making it 
a bright yellow; to the other half add two 
gills of boiling water and the scoke-berry 
juice to make it a deep red; place these jellies 
on ice until they are so stiffened that you can 
barely take up a heaped teaspoonful, then 
wet a mould, lay in two tablespoonfuls of 
one color and then of the other, putting in 
each a strip of quince about an inch long 
and half an inch wide. In this wav fill the 
mould and place it at once on the ice.

INSTRUCTIONS FOR CAKE BAKING 

FlUST, allciul to Ihc oven, which musl, 
lor most cakes, be the heat required i'or 
baking bread. Sec that the fire is in condi- 
tion to insure a steady heat for tliree-fourths 
oi" an hour from the time the cake goes in, 
neither increasing nor decreasing the tem- 
perature. It is bad to add coal while the 
cake is in the oven, and it is equally bad to 
open oven doors for cooling. Then prepare 
the baking pans. These must be thinly but- 
tered, and the lower part covered with paper 
(many butter the paper also, but it is not 
necessary.) Collect all the ingredients, 
measured or weighed, as the recipe requires. 
Should the butter be quite salty, it must be 
kvashed in cold water, press out the water 
and cream the butter, when the sugar may 
be gradually added and thoroughly beaten 
in. Beat the yolks of the eggs until they are 
thick and smooth, an.d add them, beating 
well, to the butter and sugar; add the spice, 
then beat the whites of the eggs to so stiff a 
froth that they will adhere to the bowl, when 
it is turned upside down. If the recipe re- 
quires milk, it should now be stirred in 
alternately with the whites of the eggs and 
then the Hour, after which it should be 
stirred as little as possible. Fill the pans but 
lillie more than half their (le])th and if ])()s- 
sible do not move them while the cake is 
baking. 

Icing can be made while the cake, if in 
ordinary loaves, is in the oven. If the icing 
be for jelly cake, which bakes in a few min- 
utes, it should be I'eady when the cake goes 
into the oven. The whites of three eggs will 
make sufficient icing for two loaves of cake. 

The batter of some kinds of cake will keep 
a week in a cold place — "drop cake," for in- 
stance. It is not always convenient to bake 
the quantity made, nor does the cake keep 
fresh for many days. 

Icing will keep for weeks, closely cov- 
ered in a cool place. If too stiflf from partial 
drying, add a little water. The whites of 
eggs will keep for several days. The white 
of a common sized egg weighs one ounce. 
It is very convenient to know this, as you 
sometimes want to take the white of one or 



more eggs from seven or eight thai have 
been put away togetiier, and by weighing 
you can be sure of the number. 



PASTRY 

In making pastry, it is all-inqjortaiit to 
have good batter and good lard, and that 
they shall be firm. They should be thor- 
oughly hardened on the ice; the dough 
should be mixed with ice water and made 
in a cool room. Do not touch it with the 
hand until it reaches the paste board, and 
then as little as possible. The object of roll- 
ing is to incorporate the hard butter and 
lard with the flour, without the aid of heat. 
Pastry, with the exception of mince pies, 
which are heated when served, should al- 
ways be eaten the day it is baked. Unbaked 
pastry may be kept for several days if per- 
fectly cold; in using it, it is necessary to 
simply flour the plate, not butter it. 



PUFF PASTE 

One pound of flour. 

Five ounces of Hour for Ihc board and 
rolling-pin. 

Half a pound of butter. 

Half a pound of lard. 

Two gills of ice water. 

Sift the flour in a two-c[uarl bowl; cut (he 
butter and lard into bits about the size 
of an unshelled almond. Scatter the 
water over the whole, and mix lightly 
with the knife. Ffour a space on the 
board, put the rough dough in the center of 
this space, flour the pin and roll the dough. 
With a small sieve sift a light, barely per- 
ceptible coating of flour over the whole 
sheet; then fold it in thirds lengthwise and 
across, making a piece about eight inches 
long and seven inches wide; turn it over and 
put more flour under it, and over the board; 
roll it out again, sift it with flour and fold; 
I'oll it out the third time; sift and roll lightly 
in the form of a scroll; cut it across in the 
center, lay it on a plate and leave it on the 
ice for fifteen minutes or longer, when it is 
ready for use.

THE MENU AND RECIPE HOOK 



FOR VOL A VENT (Patties) 
Roll i)iitt' i);istc one inch or tlirce-quaiicrs 
of an inch tliick. and about tho size desired. 
Lay it on a baking tin, and if a small vol 
an vent is required cut it round; if large, 
oval. For cutting round, use a saucepan 
cover. Trace with a knife, dipped in water 
to prevent sticking, a smaller inner circle, 
for the cover, leaving an edge about one inch 
l)road, penetrate the knife to nearly half 
tlie thickness of the paste; or a 
smaller tin cover may be laid on the paste 
and pressed in gently, to mark the inner cir- 
cle. Bake, and when well risen and of a 
nice light brown, take out; lift the cover 
immediately, being careful not to make any 
ojjenings in the lower part; this is called 
one of tlie nicest operations in cookery. Lay 
tlie cover aside, and if the inner part does 
not seem thoroughly baked, return it to the 
oven for a short time. If an oval vol an vent 
is wished, the paste may be cut with an oval 
basin, or niaked with a vegetable dish and 
cut with a knife. 



PLAIN WHITE CAKE 

Four ounces of butter. 

Three gills of milk. 

One and one-half pints of Hour. 

One pint of sugar.

Two eggs, the wliites wliijjped to a stiff 
froth. 

Bitter almonds to taste. 

Beat the butter and sugar together, add 
the yolks and beat until very light, then 
stir in the milk in which the soda is dis- 
solved, the flour in which the cream of tartar 
is sifted, and the whites of the eggs alterna- 
tely. Add the butter almonds, put in a 
paper-lined i)un and baki'. 



DELICIOUS COFFEE CAKE 

Two and one-half pounds of flour. 
Nine ounces of brown sugar. 
Fourteen ounces of butter.

Two teaspoonsful of cinnamon and two 
of nutmeg. 

One teaspoonful ol' clovi's and one of all- 
s])ice. 

Two teas])0()nfuls of soda, dissolved in a 
little of the coffee. 

Rub the sugar and butter togtilur, add 
molasses, coffee and tlour alternately, leav- 
ing a i)int of flour in which to rub tiie fruit, 
then add tiie soda, and lastlv the fruit. 



SHORT CAKE 

One quart of flour. 

One pint of thick sour milk. 

One and one-quarter teas|)()()nfuls of soda. 

One-third teaspoonful of salt. 

Two ounces of butter. 

Put the flour in a bowl, put the sour milk 
in the center with the soda dissolved in a 
teaspoonful of hot water, the salt and the 
butter stirred to a soft cream; beat thor- 
oughly. Before mixing in all of tiie tlour, 
stir ill the whole, jilace it on tlie tloured

FOR FREEZING ICES 

One part of rock or coarse tabic salt. 

Two parts ice, broken the size of a walnut. 

Pack the cream pail firmly above tiie 
height of tiie cream. For three pints of 
cream, pour over the ice in tlie freezer one 
and a lialf pints of water, and for every addi- 
tional quart of cream add lialf a pint of 
noter, after the packing. 



TO FREEZE CREAM WITHOUT A 
FREEZER 

If one wishes to freeze a pint or quart of 
cream wlien there is no freezer at liand. it 
may be done in a tin pail in from twenty to 
thirty minutes. Put tlie cream in a two- 
quart tin pail and cover it with a mixture of 
coarse salt witli finely pounded ice or snow, 
in the proportion of one-third salt; put a 
quart of it in an ordinary wooden pail, place 
the tin pail in tlic center and pack it firmly 
witli tlic freezing mixture to witliin an inch 
of the top; tlien remove the cover and stir 
with a wooden spoon, constantly detacliing 
tlie frozen cream from tiic bottom and sides 
of tlie pail, until tiic wliole is stiff; smooth it 
over tlie top, replace the cover, pour off the 
water, repack, cover the whole closely with 
a piece of carpet and leave it for an hour or 
two in as cool a place as can be found. In 
winter the jjail may stand on a chair in tiie 
kitchen while the cream is being stirred, in 
summer in any shady place in the open air. 

This mode gives on the pleasure of seeing 
the freezing process, which is concealed in 
jiatent freezers. 



LEMON ICE CREAM 

To two quarts of sour cream (it must be 
cream that has soured quickly) take one of 
sweet cream, one pound and a half of sugar, 
the juice and rind of one lemon; cut the rind 
thin and steep it ten or fifteen minutes in 
half a pint of the sweet cream over boiling 
water; strain, cool and add it to the rest. Put 
it in the freezer, and set it in ice an hour be- 
fore freezing. 

ICE CREAM 

Put one pound of sugar, a vanilla bean 
split and two quarts of milk over boiling 



water; Ijeat six eggs with half a pound of 
sugar and add to the milk wlieii liot; cook 
until a little tliickened, tal'c it off and when 
cold add tiie quart of ricli cream, wliip it 
Ijrisklv for a few minutes and freeze it. 



ICE CREAM (Corn Starch) 

Tliree pints of milk and cream together, 
reserving a little for mixing the starch. 

Ten ounces of sugar. 

Four even tablespoonfuls of corn starch. 

Vanilla extract or bean. 

Four eggs, tlie whites beaten stifi'. 

Let the milk and cream scald over boiling 
water, add the starch, the beaten yolks and 
the sugar. When the custard adheres well 
to the spoon add the whites of the eggs and 
take it from the fire, flavor and when cold 
freeze. If the vanilla bean is preferred to the 
extract, it must be boiled and scraped in the 
milk. 



PINEAPPLE ICE 

PaiT good ripe i)inea])pUs and cut out the 
eyes; grate them and pass the pulp through 
the collander; to one quart of this add one 
and a quarter pounds of sugar and one pint 
of water; whip the whites of two eggs to a 
stiff froth and add the above little by little, 
heating well to make them mix, freeze. 



TO PREPARE PISTACHE NUTS FOR ICE 
CREAM 

Pour boiling water over them; let them 
stand a few moments, drain and cover again 
with boiling water, when the skins will slip 
off quite easily. They are then pounded to 
a paste in a mortar and mixed with the 
cream. 



CARAMEL ICE CREAM 

One and a half pounds of brown sugar. 

Three quarts of cream. 

One pint of boiling milk. 

Put the sugar in an iron frying-pan on 
the fire and stir until it is a liquid, being 
careful not to let it become too dark; add 
the milk, strain it and when cool pour it in 
the ci"eam. which it both flavors and sweet- 
ens. To be frozen like vanilla cream.

HOW TO SERVE FRESH FRUITS 



Water Melon 

Chill tlio melon on the ice; cover the inner 
part of the platter with fresh clean grape 
leaves; place the melon in the center and 
cut it in two, letting the ends fall back to 
show the fine coloring of the pulp and seeds. 
At the table it should be helped with a 
spoon, scooped out in symmetrical egg- 
shaped pieces. 

Strawberries 

Do not wash them ludcss absolutely neces- 
sary; but if it must be done, hold the shallo\\' 
basket of strawberries close under the faucet 
while you give them one good, generous 
douche, which will pass at once through the 
basket, taking with it the dirt and grit which 
would otherwise have set your teeth on edge; 
let them drain and dry for a few moments, 
then hull them, handling lightly as possible. 
Put no sugar over them; it di'aws out the 
juice and changes the character of the fruit. 
If the strawberries are not to be eaten for an 
hour or more, hang the basket in the refrig- 
erator and do not hull them until the last 
moment. 

Cherries 

(iather them in clusters with a few leaves 
atlachcd, and arrange them in a deep glass 
dish with large pieces of clear ice. Serve 
grapes likewise. 

Peaches 

It is very im])ortant that Ihcy should be 
perfectly ripe; better have a small dish of 
good jjeaches than a large dish spoiled by 
half a dozen peaches with a hard side. 
Peaches can be served sliced with wliipped 
cream, or ])lain. 

How to Cut Pineapple 

Pare it carefully, and with the point of Hie 



knife take out all the eyes; Hun, wilh a silver 

fork, pick the fruit from the core in bils as 

Apples Stewed With Cloves 

Two and half pounds of ai)ples. 

One pound of sugar. 

One cpiarl of water. 

Cloves. 

One small lemon peel. 

Put the sugar, water and lemon peil in a 
bright thin milk pan. Peel and core the ap- 
ples, sticking Ove cloves in every one. When 
the syrup is hot lay in the apples, cover and 
let them boil until about done, then remove 
the cover, that they might become clear, as 
they cook slowly and are exposed to the air. 
Stewed Peaches 

Wipe peaches that arc almost ri|)e, half 
cover them with water, cover the pan and 
stew until tender, adding sugar to suit the 
taste before they are quite done. 
Baked Pears 

Wash them, leave the stems on, put them 
in a two-quart stone crock with a gill of 
water and a half a pint of brown sugar; 
cover the crock with a piece of dough 
(coarse flour and water) rolled about half 
an inch thick, or with the stone cover be- 
longing to the crock; put them in the oven 
and hake Iwo hours or more, the tinu' de- 
|)ends on the ripeness of the fruit. 
CHEESE 

Clu'csi' ranks high as a nourishing food 
l)roduct. It is (|uile po.ssible to live on 
cheese, bread and water without endanger- 
ing the condition of health and strength. 

But cheese is served, as a rule, after the 
sweets in a course dinner. It is often served 
with fruit, which is a very delightful linish 
to a substantial dinner and relieves greatly 
the uncomfortable leeling when loo much 
has been eaten.

BREAD MAKING 

Brc'iul raised but oiicc. 

Tlirce quarts of sifted tlour. 

One quart of milk aud water. 

Oue tablespoouful salt. 

One gill of yeast or oue yeast cake. 

Scald a pint of milk and cool it with a pint 
of water, pour it on two quarts of the flour 
and the salt in a live-quart bowl or pan. 
Mix well, add the yeast, beat hard for live 
minutes, stir in the rest of the flour, then 
Hour the board, place the dough on it and 
knead vigorously for fifteen minutes, using 
barelj' enough tlour to prevent sticking. 

With practice a little Hour will go a great 
way. The hands and board must be very 
lightly covered with it, that as little as pos- 
sible maj^ be added to the bread. This quan- 
tity of dough, kneaded fifteen minutes, re- 
quires nearly a pint of water in addition. 
Mould into loaves and place them in buttered 
pans which they will but half fill. Leave 
them to rise until the bread has reached the 
top. At 80 degrees this will require from 
five to six hours. At a low temperature it 
may stand over night. When light, bake. 
If the yeast cake is used, soak it first in two 
tablespoonfuls of water, then stir it until 
smooth and add water until it measures a 
gill. This bread retains much more of the 
llavor of the wheat than that whicii is raised 
several times. It may be mixed with water 
or milk alone. 



BREAD BISCUIT 

One pint of dough ready to bake. 

Two ounces of butter. 

The white of an egg, beaten stiff. 

Soften the butter and knead all together 
for five or ten minutes; roll out, or mold 
into biscuit; lay them in a buttei'cd pan and 
when light, prick and bake. 



GRAHAM BREAD 

Take one pint of light bread sponge and 
thin it with a pint of warm water. Add two 
tablespoonfuls of molasses, a tablespoouful 
of salt and suificient graham flour to make 
a stilT batter that can be stirred with a spoon. 
Put it in well buttered pans and when light, 



bake. It requires longer baking than white 
bread, and the pans require more butter. 



BREAD CAKE 

One pound of dough ready for llie oven. 

Eight ounces of sugar. 

Four ounces of butter. 

One gill of currants. 

Half a nutmeg, grated. 

The grated rind of a lemon and half of 
the juice. 

Half teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in a 
teaspoonf ul of boiling water. 

One well-beaten egg. 

Having softened the butter, mix together 
with the hand, put the butter in two small, 
well-buttered pans, leave it in a warm place 
several hours to rise, and when light, bake. 



GINGER BREAD 

One quart, lacking one gill, of (lour. 

Half pint of sugar. 

Half a pint of molasses. 

One-quarter of a pound of butter. 

Two even teaspoonsful of cream of tartar. 

One teaspoonful of soda, dissolved in the 
milk. 

Three eggs. 

Sift the tlour and cream of tartar in a 
bowl, hollow the center and put in the but- 
ter and sugar, well stirred together, the 
beaten eggs, molasses, ginger aiul milk. Mix, 
drop in buttered patty pans and bake twenty

COFFEE AND CAFES 

THE early history of coffee as aii econ- 
omic product is involved in consider- 
able obscurity, the absence of historical fact 
being compensated for by an unusual pro- 
fusion of conjectural statements and by 
purely mythical stories. According to a 
statement contained in a manuscript belong- 
ing to the Bibloteque Nationale in Paris, the 
use of coffee was known at a period so re- 
mote as 875 A. D. 

In a treatise publislied in 1466 by an Arab 
sliief it is stated tliat a knowledge of cottee 
was lirst brought from Abyssinia into Arabia 
ajjoui tne Jjegnnung oi tne Uitecntn ceiuury 
by a learned and pious sliiek, Ujemal-li.auiu- 
i\ijou-/vii agger. Accorunig to me treatise 
aiiuueu to tue use ox cotlee as a beverage was 
prevalent among tne Aliyssimans iroin tne 
most remote period, and in Arabia tne lev- 
erage wlien tirst introduced only stipplanted 
a preparation Irom tne leaves oi tne cat, 
Celastrus edulis. its peculiar property of 
dissipating drowsiness and preventing sleep 
was taken advantage of in connection witn 
tne prolonged religious services of tlie Mo- 
iuimetans, and its use as a devotional anti- 
soporilic stirred up a tierce opposition on 
tne part of tlie strictly ortliodox and conser- 
vative section of tlie priests. Coffee was by 
them held to be an intoxicant beverage, and 
therefore proliiljited by the Koran, and tiie 
dreadful penalties of an outraged sacred law 
were iield over the heads of all who became 
adihcted to its use. Notwithstantling the 
threats of divine retribution, and though all 
manner of devices were adopted to check its 
growth, the coffee drinking habit spread rap- 
idly among the Arabian Mohametans, and 
the growth of coffee as well as its use as a 
national beverage became as inseparably as- 
sociated with Arabia as tea is with China. 
For about two centuries the entire supply 
of the world, which, however, was then lim- 
ited, was obtained from the province of 
Yemen, in South Arabia, where the cele- 
brated Mocha or Mokha is still cultivated. 

It was not till the middle of the sixteenth 
century that coffee houses were established 
in Constantinople. Here also the new habit 
excited considerable commotion among the 
ecclesiastics. The popularity of the coffee 



houses had decided intluence on the attend- 
ance of the mosques, and on that account a 
fierce hostility was excited among the relig- 
ious orders against the new beverage. They 
laid their grievances before the sultan, who 
imposed a heavy tax upon the coffee houses, 
notwithstanding which they flourished and 
extended. After the lapse of another iiun- 
dred years cottee reached Great Britain, a 
cottee house having been opened in 1652 in 
London by a Greek, Pasqua Rossie. Rossie 
came from Smyrna with Mr. D. Edwards, a 
merchant, and in the capacity of servant 
he prepared cottee daily for Mr. Edwards 
and his visitors. So popular did the new 
drink become with Mr. Edwards' friends 
that their visits occasioned him great incon- 
venience, to obviate which he directed Ros- 
sie to establish a public cottee house, which 
he accordingly did. The original establish- 
ment was in St. Michael's alley, Cornhill, 
over the door of which Rossie erected a sign 
with his portrait, subsequently announcing 
himself to be "the lirst who made and pub- 
licly sold cottee drink in England." It is 
remarkable tiiat the introduction of cott'ee 
into England encountered the same hostility 
tliat it was fated to meet in other countries. 
Charles II, in 1675, attempted to suppress 
cott'ee houses by a royal proclamation, in 
wliich it was stated that they were the resort 
of disattected persons "who devised and 
spread abroad divers false, malicious and 
scandalous reports, to the defamation of 
His Majesty's government, and to the dis- 
tm-bance of the peace and quiet of the na- 
tion." On the opinion of legal officials be- 
ing taken as to the legality of this step, an 
oracular deliverance was given to the ett'ect 
"that the retailing of coffee might be an in- 
nocent trade, but as it was used to nourish 
sedition, spread lies and scandalize great 
men, it might also be a common nuisance." 
In England as well as in other countries the 
most effective check on the consumption of 
coffee was found to be a heavy tax, which, 
while restricting honest trade, opened a chan- 
nel for extensive smuggling operations. 
Coft'ee is spoken of as being in use in France 
between 1640 and 1660, and thereafter it 
may be said that the use of coffee was an 
established custom in Europe and later years

in America. It is noteworthy that the three 
principal dietetic beverages of the workl 
were nitrothiced into Great Britain within 
a liw years ot eacli otiier. Cocoa was the 
iirst ot tile three wliich actually appeared in 
Europe, having been brought to Spain from 
South America; coli'ee followed, coming 
from Arabia by way of Coustanitnople; and 
lea, the latest of tiie series, came from China 
in the hands of tiie Putch. It is also more 
than probable that the Turks during the 
siege of \'ienna brought the coffee to tiiis 
city, and today you can lind the largest and 
most luxurious cotfee houses in Vienna, 
known as cafes. 

The dietetic value of coffee depends prin- 
cipally upon the alkaloid caffeine which it 
contains, in common with tea, cocoa, mate 
or Paraguary tea, guarana, antl the African 
kela nut. Its commercial value is, however, 
determined by the amount of aromatic oil, 
caffeine, whicli develops in it by the process 
of roasting. 

Coffee belongs to llie medicinal or auxil- 
iary class of food substances, being solely 
valuable for its stimulant effect upon the 
nervous and vascular system. It prockices a 
feeling of buoyancy and exhilaration com- 
parable to a certain state of alcoholic intoxi- 
cation, but which does not end in depression 
or collapse. It increases the frequency of 
the pulse, lightens the sensation of fatigue, 
and it sustains the strength under prolonged 
and severe muscuha" exertion.

SERVING A DINNER FOR $2,500 A PLATE 

When Madame Jackson Crocker Gouraud 
asked through the New York American for 
original suggestions lor serving a dinner for 
a special occasion, for which she offered 
Jji.'jOOO, the American Gastronom submitted 
tile following Menu, explanations and de- 
signs, for serving the same: 

Name — Le Grand Diner au Natural a' V 
Hors Concours — One hundred covers at 
twenty-five Iiundred (2,500) dollars a plate, 
including food, wines, service, decorations, 
staging, musical entertainment, noted talent, 
necessary costumes, etc. Nothing shall in' 
left inidone for the absolute comfort of the 
guests. 

Place — Glass pavilion especially construct- 
ed for the occasion, in Cannes, south of 
France. The interior decoration to resemble 
an Amazon Garden. The floor to be laid out 
as a green natural lawn. Blooming Century 
plants shall be a part of the tloral groups in 
corners. The illumination shall be moder- 
ately bright, the shades to be tested first and 
compared with the green effect. Miniature 
fountains, ornamented with cupids, supply 
the wines. 

The Table Plan — Two rows of round tables 
especially constructed, raised one foot from 
the tloor, fifteen feet apart; between the two 
rows of tables a ten-foot wide moving plat- 
form to run between the I'ows of tables from 
one end of the room (the entrance) to the 
other end (the exit). 

Four guests to be seated at each table so 
that every one faces the moving platform. 
The large entrance to the dining room leads 
from the service-room, which is to be trans- 
formed into a stage. A rising curtain di- 
vides the dining-room from the stage service- 
room. All courses of the dinner to appear as 
"tableaux vivants" or groups, which are 
placed stationary on the platform. An elec- 
tric signal given by the hostess raises the 
curtain at the stage entrance, and then the 
live tableau appears and pi-oceeds on the 
moving platform until it reaches the center. 
The curtain drops as soon as the group enters 
the dining-room. 

Every course shows the article of food, 
both in nature and cooked. Heavy liveried 
lackeys dressed in knickerbockers and white 



wigs are lined up on both sides of the tables 
to receive the groups from which everything 
is served to the guests. The wine butlers are 
dressed in monk's costumes. 

A small electric keyboard is to be provided 
at the side of the hostess' seat, giving her 
the control of directing the proceedings of 
the dinner by simply pressing the button. 

Before the dinner actually starts, the host- 
ess presses the button, the curtain rises and 
a Steinwaj' grand moves in noiselessly on 
the platform, with Paderewsy sitting at the 
keys, playing the overture. As soon as this 
is over, the piano with the great artist rolls 
out at the other side, through the exit. 

Next comes Tableau No. 1 — The Cocktail. 
The hostess again presses the button, the 
curtain rises and here comes the cocktail 
served in a large stone fountain beautifully 
mounted, such as are used for baptising in 
the Catholic Church; two female harpists, 
dressed in light silk, sitting on each side of 
the large stone bowl, playing soft tunes of 
some celebrated selection. Floral decora- 
tions finish the group. 

After tins comes Tableau No. 2 — The 
Hors d'Ocuvre. Crocodile eggs with caviar 
dressing, prepared by Escofiier, and served 
on the back of a crocodile on a dish especi- 
ally constructed, as long as the crocodile; a 
couple of Hottentots stationed on each side 
playing their native instruments. You will 
notice, also, that the service is not onlj' artis- 
tic but very practical to handle by the ser- 
vants. 

Tableau No. 3 — The Soup. Turtle soup. 
The curtain rises again, and there are six 
live giant turtles rolling in, in pairs, bearing 
>n their backs the large soup tureens, con- 
aining the turtle soup. In the rear of the 
turtles, Mary Garden sings the "Meditation 
of Thais." Large silk ribbons are strung 
from the turtles to the great actress, this giv- 
ing tlie aijpearance of six in hand, but turtles 
instead of horses. The soup to be made 
from my recipes from Bai'bados. 

Tai)leau No. 4 — The Fish. A miniature 
aquarium with artistic bridges laid across, 
and live trout, swimming in the water. The 
bridges are to be removed and thereon the 
trout are served in jelly. A group of Tyro- 
lean singers in native costume sit around the 
aquarium and sing Tyrolean airs.

PLAN AND SUGGESTIONS 

FOR THE PEACE BANQUET 

The wjir now goiiif* on in Europe, in which 
the flower of the several nations involved are 
heing destroyed, will terminate, let us liope 
and pray, very soon, hut without douht, it 
must at some time. Peace will ultimately 
he concluded and the occasion, like similar 
ones heforc, will he celchrated with a han- 
([uet. 

A hanquet, after the peace treaty has heen 
sii^ned, where all the great powers and 
smaller, though not less important nations, 
participants in the greatest conflict this 
])lanet has witnessed, as well as neutrals, 
shall be represented, would be appropriate. 

Having something like this in view. The 
AmericJMi (lastropom dri'W a nlan of seats 
for the ban([uet table and of other necessary 
details, which is here given, and submits 
this plan and other matter to the consider- 
ation of the proper authorities. 

This peace banquet as suggested, shall suit 
the occasion; it shall be the official ceremony 
where the representatives of the nations 
shall pledge themselves to an everlasting 
I)eace. 

This immortal occasion should promjit 
something extraordinary. The Ignited States 
shoidd commission the head of its nation. 
President Wilson, who has so remarkably 
distinguishe dhimself as the greatest peace 
advocate, to rcjjresent this country, and be 
honored to preside at the dinner. His pres- 
ence among the crowned heads of the world 
will greatly strengthen the purpose of this 
the most historical event the world has ever 
known after its greatest war. 

It will restore hope to all nations; if will 
alleviate the suflferings of people through the 
holv assurance that war must not occur 
again, and militarism should cease. 

The Peace Palace at The Hague may be 
selected as the most suitable place for this 
celebration. Mr. Andrew Carnegie is the 
right person to support this plan to make it 
a reality. 



All the crowned heads and presidents of 
republics to be seated at one table, same 
to he in shape of a large horseshoe, as shown 
in plan. Other personalities to be seated at 
round tables. 

The floral designs to consist of gigantic 
floral groups of original artistic designs. 

The courses served constituting the menu 
he mounted in artistic groups, placed on a 
railed noiseless platform, leading into the 
center of the great horseshoe table. 

Each course to rejjrescnt a nation. A spe- 
cial gallery to be provided for the ladies who 
are not at the banquet table, but who shall 
witness the ceremony from the gallery. The 
Queen on Holland to be hostess. 

A high dignitary of a neutral nation may 
he selected as toastmaster. The language 
adoj)ted should be French. Each course of 
the menu might appear in the language rep- 
resenting the country. 

Permission should he granted to take fdni 
pictures of this historical ceremony in all 
its detail, including the arrival of the guests, 
the reception and the proceedings of the 
dinner. .\11 s])eeches to be stenograi)hed for 
])rint. 

The enormous revenues derived from the 
exhibition of this film picture throughout the 
world, should be turned over to the Inter- 
national Red Cross for distribution among 
the poor widows and children of the fallen 
soldiers, who sacrificed their lives for the 
defence of their fatherland or patrie. 

When the guests arc seated, a masterpiece 
of profound musical power shall be recited 
by not less than 400 instruments, placed at 
a certain distance, followed by a newly com- 
posed peace song rendered by the two great- 
est ni.nenner-chors in the world, the Wiener 
and Koelner ricsancr Verein. After this, the 
guests should rise from their seats in a short 
prayer in honor of the fallen soldiers. 

The dinner will then proceed. 

In conclusion, The American Gastronome 
desires to oflfer his services, without compen- 
sation, should this suggestion meet with ap- 
proval.
