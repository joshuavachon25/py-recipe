'O woman 1 enthroned by your visions elate 
In temples of learning, and chambers of State, — 
Politician, or lawyer, or doctor so wise, 
Go bottle your tears and pickle your sighs ; 
For descend you must to every day life 
And enter the ranks of the housekeepers strife. 
You may settle like Darwin, the monkey's sad fate. 
You may settle all questions of kingdom or S:ate, 
But no art of persuasion, witty or wise. 
Will settle the coffee or make the bread rise, 
No doctrines nor creed since eating began 
Were known to regale a right hungry man, 
Your doctrines, affinities, destinies dim, — 
Even total depravity 's nothing to him, 
A judge's decision may turn in a dish. 
Or a doctor's prescription be found in a fish. 
Great thoughts gleam in gravy, and nations are tost 
On billows of soup, — and finally lost. 
Then do not rebel, but with good common sense, 
Submit to the stomach's omnipotence. 
Like the ghost of poor Bancjuo, you always must meet 
That unsettled, old (juestion, ' O what shall we eat ? ' 
And another close follows — ' O what shall we cook ? ' 
That question is answered in this little book."

PREFACE. 



When we first thought of compiling and selling these recipes, the 
amount that would thus be brought into the Lord's treasury was our 
paramount object, but as we have studied how to be most helpful to 
those who will patronize us, our solicitude to give back to them 
value received, has almost overwhelmed every other idea, for we 
would bring no reproach upon the cause to which our efforts are 
dedicated. We claim no originality for our work. Like the bee 
that sips the sweetness of every flower, we have gathered suggestions 
wherever we could find them. The recipes we offer have been used 
by the best house-keepers, in our own and other communities, and 
we bespeak for them a kindly reception and fair trial. 

As the book goes forth to stranger and friend, our work is 
done. We have bn^ught our loaves and fishes to the Master. May 
His hand direct the distribution, and bless the offering that we lay 
down at His feet. 



We do most sincerely express our thanks to the many ladies who 
have contributed their recipes, and also, to the advertisers who have 
so kindly aided in accomplishing our work. 

Mrs. Wm. C. Arline. 

Mrs. E. W. Bedford. 



DIRECTIONS. 

Ao-ate, iron, or porcelain kettles should be used for 
making soups. Meats for soups should be put to cook 
in cold water, boiled gently, and the required quantity 
of salt added at first, to extract the juices of the meat, 
and cause the scum to rise. AHow one quart of water 
and a teaspoon of salt for each pound of meat. Remove 
all the scum carefully before the vegetables are added. 
All grease should be removed before putting in the 
vegetables. It is well to cook the meat the day before 
the soup is wanted, that the grease may cool and be re- 
moved. It can readily be removed while the soup is 
hot by adding a little cold water to the liquor. 

BI.ACK SOI :P. 

Cut the meat from beef shank-bone. Mash the bone 
and simmer all slowl}^ in two gallons of water. Six 
hours. Set away to get cold. Next day skim off all 
the grease that has risen. Put liquor on, with vege- 
tables, two turnips, as much cabbage, one small onion, 
carrots and tomatoes, well chopped ; boil till vegetables 
are tender, then strain through a colander, add a tea- 
spoonful of powdered cloves, and boil all a few moments. 
— Mrs. Jeannette Leonard, Fayette, Mo. 

iviiiTE sorp. 

Simmer for an hour in three quarts of chicken or veal 
stock, parsley, onion or celery. Cut in small pieces, 
with a blade of mace. Strain and thicken with two 
ounces of liour. Boil two minutes. Add half pint of

sweet cream. Season with salt and pepper. "When 
about to boil stir in the well-beaten yolks of three eggs. 
Serve. — Mrs. H. Everett, Council Bluffs , Iowa. 

ToiiATo sorp. 

One quart fresh milk, one pint tomato juice, three table- 
spoonfuls melted butter, one tablespoonful flour, two tea- 
spoonfuls salt, one teaspoonful black pepper, one tea- 
spoonful soda. Let the milk come to a boil, then add 
the juice, in which the soda has been well dissolved; 
stir the flour, salt and pepper in the butter, and also 
add. Boil a few minutes and pour over crackers, and 
serve. — Ilrs. Mamie White Chinri, Franklin., Mo. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

To one quart of water add the contents of a quart can 
of tomatoes ; boil iwenty minutes, then strain through 
a sieve ; add one pint of cream, or rich milk ; lump of 
butter the size of an egg, and tablespoonful of flour, 
rubbed together. Add this to soup, and boil five min- 
utes. One-half nutmeg grated in, salt and pepper to 
taste. Then ready for the table. — 3Irs. H. Emrett., 
Council Bluffs, loioa. 

TOMATO SOUP. 

To one gallon of water use half a chicken ; let boil 
half an hour, then add two large tomatoes, or one cup of 
canned; one cup of rice. Just before taking up j^ut in 
a cup of cream and a small lump of butter ; salt and 
pepper to your taste. — Mrs. T. J. Payne, Fayette, Mo. 

GERMAN FRITTER SOUP. 

To one chicken take three quarts of water; boil two 
hours and a half; take three tablespoonfuls of flour, 
four eggs, one cup of sweet milk ; mix into a thin batter 
and make into griddle cakes. The cakes should be 
baked as thin as a leaf; cut in small strips and put into 
a bowl ; season with a little mace and nutmeg ; salt and 
pepper to taste. — Mrs. Joseph Memmel, Fayette, Mo. 



SOUPS. 11 

OYSTER SOUP. 

One can of oysters, two tablespoonfals of butter; 
strain the liquor from tlie oysters, add to it the milk ; 
set it over the fire in a vessel ; set in a pot of boiling 
water; when it is near boiling add the butter, salt and 
pepper, then add the oysters and let them stew until 
they ruffle on the edge. This will be in about five min- 
utes. I like it best with a few crackers broken in it, 
just before taking it from the fire. Serve just as soon as 
done. The crowning excellence in oyster soup is to 
have it cooked just enough. — 3f?'S. EUzcibetli Major, 
Fayette^ Mo. 

BEEF SOIP. 

Secure a good sized soup bone and put it in one gallon 
of cold water, with a teaspoonful of salt; more water 
can be added later on if necessary ; skim when needed ; 
while boiling keep it well covered, and boil slowly for 
four or five hours. An hour before using add one can 
of tomatoes, or eight good sized ripe tomatoes, also two 
or three small potatoes, sliced thin, and one teaspoonful 
black pepper and one tablespoonful of salt. To one 
e^^, well beaten, add fiour enough to make very stiff; 
roll very thin and let dry for an hour ; then cut in thin 
strips, and drop in soup fifteen minutes before serving; 
also one tablespoonful of fiour, mixed in a little cold 
water, and add it the last thing just before taking from 
the fire. — Mrs. Margaret Unriili., Fayette., Mo. 

BEEF SOI P. 

For one gallon soup pare six or eight good sized pota- 
toes, slice thin and boil tender ; take same number 
large, ripe tomatoes, one large teacup dried okra, one 
teaspoonful soda, three-quarters cup sugar, a little rice, 
if preferred. Boil each in separate vessels, till tender, 
then all together and boil twenty minutes. A medium 
sized beef bone will season sufficiently. Add salt to

taste. Some think cabbage chopped fine and added an 
improvement; many do not. — Miss Jennie Key ser, FQ.y- 
ette, Mo. 

MOCK OYSTER SOUP. 

One pint tomatoes, well stewed ; one quart boiling 
water ; })ut in a teaspoonful of soda. When it has done 
foaming add one quart boiling milk; a piece of butter, 
size of an egg. Salt and pepper to taste. Pour upon 
three soda crackers, to suit taste. — Mrs. Samuel Co2^p, 
St. Louis. 

BEEF BOX IIELE. 

Take the face of the rump and put it on to boil about 
four hours ; after it has been on half an hour skim it 
well ; then add carrots and turnips, cut up fine ; roast 
one onion brown on the coals, stick it with cloves 
and put it in ; add half a tumbler of red wine (port is 
better,) a little tomato, or other catsup, cayenne, or any 
other good thing. Before serving take out some of the 
gravy in a teacup, and cut up a pickled cucumber into 
slices and pour over the beef. — Mrs. Samuel Treat, St. 
Louis. 

GREE^ PEA SOUP. 

Take one quart of peas, cover with about three quarts 
of water; season with salt and pepper. When almost 
done add a teacupful of rich cream. Serve. — Mrs. T. R. 
Betts, Fayette, Mo. 

BROIVIVED FI.OITR. 

Put a pint of Hour in a saucepan ; stir constantly 

with a wooden spoon until it is a dark brown. Put 

away in a covered jar, and use it in soups or gravies. 

More of this is required to thicken with than of un- 

browned flour. 

CARAMEE. 

Caramel, for coloring soups, is made by putting a 
tablespoon of sugar and a pinch of salt in a diy sauce- 
pan, over the fire ; stir constantly until it is slightl}^

spoon of water; keep stirring and gradually add a cup 
of water. Be sure the sugar is all dissolved. 
a ricli color and is better than browned flour 



This gives 



FOR COI.OKIXC; SOI PS. 

For an amber color use grated carrot ; for hrown nse 
caramel, or browned Hour ; for reel use the pulp and 
juice of ripe tomatoes; for white soup use white vege 
tables ; for thickening use rice, pearl, barley or mac- 
caroni.

HINTS. 

Notice that the body of the fish is firm and the eyes 
full and the gills red. Almost every kind of fish is 
either boiled, broiled, or fried. Any small fish of the 
size of a smelt, or smaller, is better fried tljan prepared 
in any other way. Fish, like salmon-trout, are best 
when baked, and some fine sauce poured over them. A 
cup of diluted cream, in which is stirred two tablespoon- 
fuls of melted butter and a little chopped parsley makes 
an excellent sauce for salmon-trout. Before broiling 
fish rub the gridiron witli a piece of fat, to prevent its 
sticking. Lay the skin side down first. The earthy 
taste often found in fresh water fish can be removed by 
soaking in salt and water. Most kinds of salt fish 
should be soaked in cold water for twenty -four hours ; 
the fleshy side turned down in the water. 

TO BOIL FISH. 

Fish should be scaled and thoroughly cleaned, well 
salted and put in a cold place until time to cook. Boil 
in a fish kettle, with water enough to cover it, or wrap 
and tie in a cloth, and boil in any cooking vessel ; if 
the fish is large it can be doubled in the cloth ; cover 
with more than two inches of boiling water, adding a 
teaspoonful of salt and a tablespoonful of vinegar to 
every pound of fish. A good sized fish will cook in half 
an hour. Be careful not to break in taking out. 

Sauce. — Stir into a pint of milk, boiling, a piece of 
butler the size of an eg^g, mixed with Hour, and a hard 
boiled idgg^ cut up fine ; pour this over the fish or serve 
in a sauce-boat. — Mrs. 8. P. Si7?ipso7i, St. Louis, 1875,

FISH AND OYSTERS. 15 

BAKED FISH. 

Clean and wipe the tish dry ; tie a string round tlie 
head and dredge with flonr, pepper and salt ; bake in a 
pan, witli butter and lard, and baste it often while 
baking; a good size fish should cook three-quarters of 
an hour. If desired it can be stuffed with the same 
dressing used for turkeys, onl}^ more highly seasoned. 

FRIED FISH. 

Clean the fish well ; cut up into pieces about two by 
four inches ; lay around in a colander, skin down, and 
sprinkle with salt. Let stand an hour, or half a day, if 
need be. Have the fat hot in a ftying-pan. Roll in 
corn meal ; fry slowly and cook a long time, till thor- 
oughly done through. If desired it can be then dij)ped 
in well beaten egg and rolled in crackers after frying, if 
preferred. — 3Its. E. Major. 

ISOII.FD PIKE WITH EGO SAFCE. 

Any llsh will do ; after it is dressed, la}" it in the form 
of a circle, b}^ putting its tail into its mouth, and take a 
stitch with a darning needle in its head and tail ,to hold 
it in place. To two quarts of water put half a cup of 
vinegar, a teaspoon of whole cloves, same of whole 
pepper, a bay leaf. Half a lemon sliced is a nice addi- 
tion, and a tablespoon of salt. Put over in cold water, 
and boil till the tins fall off easily, then the skin can be 
easily removed, if desired. Serve with egg sauce, made 
by adding hard boiled eggs, cut up in small pieces, to a 
white sauce. Pour the sauce inside the circle of tish. 
Lay a sprig of parsley on top of one side of the tish, and 
a few slices of lemon at the side of the platter. 

BAKED FISH WITH CREA^fl SAl €E. 

Take a tablespoon of butter and a tablespoon of flour, 
mix in a saucepan over the Are; add either milk or 
water, till a pint has been used; season with salt and 
pepper. Take any kind of baked fish, remove the bone 



10 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 

and skin, put in a baking dish, cover with the sauce and 
dust witli cracker dust. Bake a delicate brown. 

BROILED FISH. 

To broil a shad, or aii}^ other fish, grease the bars of 

the broiler well. Put the inside to the lire first. The 

backbone can be removed by running a knife along 

under it, and the long bones can be loosened and taken 

out, one, or more, at a time, with a little knife, after the 

backbone is cut away from them. Let brown without 

burning, till the flakes separate. Turn the skin part to 

the fire long enough to brown. Season either before or 

after cutting. 

SHEI.I. FISH— CXAMS. 

To judge whether clams and oysters are fresh, insert 

a knife, and if the shell instantly close firmly on the 

knife the oysters are fresh. If it shuts slowly and 

faintly, or not at all, they are dying, or dead. When 

the shell of raw oysters are found gaping open they are 

not good. 

FRIED CXAMS. 

Take large soft-shell clams, dry them in a cloth, and 

dip them first in beaten Qgg and then powdered cracker 

or bread crumbs, and fry in sweet lard or bu<:ter, or 

both, mixed. 

FRIED FROGS. 

Scald the hind quarters in boiling water, rub them 

with lemon juice and boil for three minutes ; wipe them, 

dip them first in cracker dust, then in a mixture of two 

beaten eggs in half a cup of milk, seasoned with pepper 

and salt ; then again in cracker crumbs. When they 

are well covered with crumbs, fry in a mixture of hot 

lard and butter. 

TR ASK'S SEI.ECT SHORE MACKEREI.. 

Take a mackerel, put it in soak over night in a pan of 
water, skin side up ; take it out and wipe it dr}^ with a 
towel, then fry it in butter, and serve hot. If preferred 



FISH AND OYSTERS. 17 

broil it, and put on hot butter; or if preferred it can be 

boiled in a pan of water, and then served with drawn 

butter. 

CODFISH AXI> C'REA:*!. 

Freshen the codfish to taste ; turn off the water ; add 

milk and butter, and a small quantity of thickening; 

stir well ; break in two eggs, and serve wlien cooked. 

< OWFISII BATil.S. 

Boil and mash potatoes, and keej) Avarm for mixing 
with the codfish ; freshen the codfish, taking care not 
to freshen too much ; add to the codfish double amount 
of potatoes ; put in pork fat for seasoning, and milk 
enough to soften ; roll into balls, and fiy in hot pork fat 
until entirely brown. 

FRIED OYSTERS. 

Strain off the liquor and dry the oysters well in a 
towel ; beat light the yolks of two eggs ; add one half 
teacup of cream ; season with pepper and salt; dip in 
rolled crackers, then in the egg, and again in the crack- 
ers ; drop in boiling lard, and fry until a light brown ; 
garnish with slices of lemon. — 3Irs. Jt P. Williams^ 
Fayette, Mo. 

BROILED OYSTERS. 

Drain select o^^sters in a colander; dip them one 

by one into melted butter, to prevent sticking to the 

gridiron, and place them on a wire gridiron ; broil over a 

clear fire ; when nicely browned on both sides, season 

with salt and pepper, and plenty of butter, and lay 

them on buttered toast, moistened with a little hot 

water. Serve very hot or the}' will not be nice. Oysters 

cooked in this way and served on broiled beefsteak are 

nice. 

OYSTER (ROQl ETTES. 

Take the hard end of the oyster, leaving the other end 
in nice sluipe for a stew or soup ; scald them ; then choj) 
fine, and then add an equal weight of potatoes, rubberl

through a colander ; to one pound of this add two 
ounces of butter, one teaspoonful of salt, half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper, half a teaspoonful of mace, and one 
half gill of cream ; maL-e in small rolls ; dip in egg and 
grated bread ; fry in beef lard. 

FRICASSEED OYSTERS. 

Drain the liquor from a quart of oysters; strain half 
a pint and put in a porcelain kettle, and when it boils 
put in the oysters ; have a tablespoonful of liour rubbed 
well into two tablespoonsful of butter; when the oys- 
ters begin to swell stir in the butter and Hour ; cook 
until the oysters are white and plump, then add a gill 
of cream, and pepper and salt. 

FRIEI> OYSTERS. 

Take large oysters, wash and drain ; dip them into 
flour; put in a hot frying-pan, with plenty of lard and 
butter; season with salt andpe23per ; fry brown on both 
sides. Fried in this way they are similar to broiled 
oysters. 

C'HICKEBT AND OYSTER PIE. 

Parboil a chicken, cut up and place in a pie dish ; 

cover with oysters, and season to taste; add two hard 

boiled eggs, cut into slices, with piece of butter, size of 

an egg. in the center; dust the whole with liour, and 

pour on one half pint of milk ; put on a puff paste crust, 

and bake about three-quarters of an hour in a moderate 

oven. 

SCAEEOPED OYSTERS. 

Cover the bottom of a baking dish with crackers, 
rolled, or stale light bread ; then a layer of oysters, 
with butter, pepper, and salt ; a layer of crumbs again, 
and so on until the dish is full. Having the last layer 
crumbs, pour over the oyster liquor, and if that is not 
sufficient to moisten well add milk. Bake about three- 
quarters of an hour. — 3frs. E. Major, Fayette, Mo. 



FISH AND OYSTERS. 19 

STr.A:»iEn otstkrs ix the siiei.i.. 

Wash well and lay in a steamer. When they are 
cooked enough the shell will open. They may be 
turned into hot dishes, or served in the shells ; to be 
seasoned by the consumer. 

OYSTER PATTIES. 

Line small patry-pans with puff paste, into each pan 
pat six oysters, bits of batter, pepper and salt, sprinkle 
over a little flour and hard boiled eggs, chopped, (allow- 
ing about six eggs for six patties,) cover with an upper 
crust, notch the edges and bake. Serve either in the 
pans or remove to a larger platter. 

OYSTER A EA POl EETTE. 

Scald a dozen oj^sters in their own liquor, salt and 
remove the oysters, add a tablespoonful of butter, the 
juice of half a lemon, a gill of cream, and a teaspoonfal 
of flour ; beat up the yolk of one e^g while the sauce is 
simmering ; add the egg and simmer the whole, until it 
thickens. Place the oysters on a hot dish, poar the 
sauce over them, sprinkle a little chopped parsley on 
the top and serve. 

O ASTER EEAYOR. 

A German cook has discovered a way to have oyster 
flavor all the year round. Take fresh, large, plump oys- 
ters, beard them, and place them in a vessel over the 
fire for a few moments in order to extract the juice, then 
put them to cool, and chop them fine with powdered bis- 
cuit, mace, and finely minced lemon peel ; pound them 
until they become a paste; make them up into thin 
cakes, place them on a sheet of pai)er in a slow oven 
and let them bake until they become quite hard ; pound 
them directly into powder, and place the powder in a 
dry tin box. well covered ; keep in a dry place and it 
will be very much appreciated when the true oyster 
flavor is imparted to flsh, sauce and dishes. This makes 
a delicous sauce for fresh cod.

DIRECTIONS. 

Fresh meats should always be cooked in boiling 
water, and kept constantly boiling, if not, the meat 
will soak up the water. If more water is needed 
be careful that it is boiling water ; remove the scum 
when it hrst begins to boil ; allow twenty minutes for 
each pound of fresh meat. Salt meat should be boiled 
in cold water, allowing twenty hve minutes to every 
pound. The more gently meat boils the more tender 
it is. 

ROAST BEEF. 
The sirloin and standing rib pieces are the best ; 
have the butcher take out as much of the bone of the 
latter as possible ; skewer it to keep it in shape ; sprin- 
kle with salt and pepper ; pour a little water into the 
pan to keep the meat from burning; allow twenty min- 
utes to the pound for rare beef, one half hour when to 
be well done ; when done, put the meet into a platter 
and keep warm ; pour oif the drippings, and with the 
dark remaining prepare your grav}^ by a few dishes of 
brown flour, a little water, the whole brought to a boil. 
Send to the table hot. 

BOAST POBK. 

Season well and roast slowly at hrst, allowing fully 
half an hour to a pound ; put some water in the pan, 
and baste often. Cook thoroughly. Fried cabbage is 
very nice with pork, also any tart sauce ; canned vege- 
tables, or turnips, are nice; celery is always admissible. 
20 



MEATS. 21 

ROAST I.EG OF I.AMB. 

Roast it ill the usual nianuer. When about done, 
and a light brown on top, make a dressing in this way : 
Put into a skillet one large kitchen spoonful of lard ; 
when hot pour into it this batter: One pint of butter 
milk, one handful of meal, two handfuls of flour, one 
egg, half teaspoon of soda, teaspoonful of salt, a little 
sage, and one small onion. Stir constantly until done. 
Cut the roast several times across the top, and spread 
the dressing on over the top and sides ; return to the 
oven and brown. This is veil/ nice. — 3Irs. Louisa Se- 
bree, FayeMe., Mo. 

ROAST I.ITTI.E PIG. 

The pig should be three weeks old, well cleaned, and 
stuffed with a dressing of this proportion : Two large 
onions, four times the quantity of bread crumbs, three 
teaspoonfuls of chopped sage, two ounces of butter, half 
a salt-spoonful of pepper, one salt spoonful of salt, and 
one egg. or it may be filled with veal force-meat stuffing, 
if preferred, or, it may be stuffed with hot, mashed pota- 
toes. Sew it together with a strong thread, trussing its 
fore legs forward and its hind legs backward. Rub the 
pig with butter, flour, pepper, and salt. Roast it at 
flrst before a very slow Are, as it should be thoroughly 
done ; or, if it is baked, the oven should not be too hot 
at first. Baste it very often. When done (in about 
three hours,) place a cob or a potato in its mouth, 
having put something in at flrst to keep it open. Serve 
it with apple- sauce or tomato sauce. — Mrs. Henderson'' s 

Cook Book. 

cha:»ii»agm: iiA.n. 

When boiling liani add one quart of strong vinegar, 
one half hour before taking ott'. This cuts the grease in 
the ham and imparts a peculiar, sharp, and pleasant 
flavor. When done put the ham into the oven to bake ; 
flrst lay three or four little sticks on the top of the i)an. 



22 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 



on tliem put your ham ; this allows all the grease to 
drop down in the pan, and leaves tlie meat very dry. • 
Bake in a slow, cool oven an hour. — M7~s. J. Kinney, 
Fraiiklin, Mo. 

BAKED HAM. 

Make a thick paste of flour (not boiled,) and cover the 
ham with it, bone and all ; put in a pan one or two 
pieces of large wire, or any thing that will keep it an 
inch from the bottom. Bake in a hot oven. If a small 
ham, fifteen minutes for each pound ; if large, twenty 
minutes. The ham should be placed in the pan, the 
skin side down. The paste forms a hard crust around 
the ham, and the skin comes off with it. — 3£rs. Lucy 
Boone, Jefferson City, Mo. 

BOIIiEO HAM. 

Put the ham to soak over the night, then wash and 
cleanse well, and put it in to boil, with cold water 
enough to cover it. Bring to the boiling point and place 
on the back of the stove to cook slowly until tender, 
when pierced with a fork ; be careful to keep the water 
at the boiling point ; turn the ham over once or 
twice. A very good rule is to allow twenty minutes to 
the pound in boiling. When done take up and put into 
a baking pan, and then dip the hands in cold water and 
take the skin between the fingers, and peel. When 
cool, and ready for baking, either rub white sugar into, 
it well and bake until brown, or take one %^g and beat 
it well, then add a little salt and pepper, and cracker 
crumbs all over the top, and brown. 

DRESSi:^0 FOR BAKED HAM. 

Boil tender, then remove the skin, set in the stove to 
bake twentj^ minutes, then spread on a batter of one 
^^^, a tablespoon of sugar, the same of buttermilk^ and 
a little soda, mixed. Set in the stove to brown. Stick 
cloves over it before putting in the oven. — M. C. Burton. 



MEATS. 23 

BOII.El> BKKF TOXCirE. 

Wasli clean, jnit into jxM with water to cover, a pint 
of salt, and a small pod of red pepper; if the water 
boils away add more; be careful to keep it covered 
until done; boil until it can be pierced easily with a 
fork ; take out, and if needed for present use, take oft' 
the skin, and set away to cool ; if to be kept some days 
do not peel until wanted for the table. Salt tongue, 
boil the same way, only leave out the salt; or a nice 
seasoning is to take a saucepan, with one cup of water, 
one half cup vinegar, four tablespoons of sugar ; cook 
till liquor is evaporated. 

BEEFSTEAK S:!IOTIIERED IX OMOXS. 

Slice the onions thin and drop in cold water; put 
steak in pan, with a little lard. Take out the onions 
and add to steak. Season with pepper and salt, cover 
tightly, and put over the fire. When the juice of the 
onions has dried up, and the meat brown on one side, 
remove the onions, turn the steak, replace onions, and 
fry till done, being careful not to burn. 

FRIEI> BEEFSTEAK. 

Pound and sprinkle well with llour , season with salt 
and pepper : lay in a frying-pan, with hot lard or butter. 
Turn frequently until done. 

BROIEEB BEEFSTEAK. 

Lay a thick, tender steak, upon a gridiron well 
greased with butter, or beef suet, over hot coals : when 
done on one side have ready the warmed phitter, with a 
little butter on it. Lay the steak, without pressing it, 
upon the platter, with the cooked side down, so that the 
juices which have gathered may rnu in the platter; 
quickly place it on the gridiron and cook the other 
side. When done to liking put on the platter again ; 
spread lightly with butter, season with salt and pepper,

and keep where it will keep warm (over boiling steam 
is best) for a few minutes, but do not let butter become 
oily. Serve on hot platter. Many prefer to sear on one 
side, turn immediately, and sear on the other, and finish 
cooking, turning often; garnish with fried sliced pota- 
toes, or with browned potato balls, the size of a marble, 
piled at each end of platter. 

MITTOX CHOPS. 
Place in a dripping-pan, season well, and set in a hot 
oven. This is the nicest way we have ever cooked mut- 
ton chops. The gravy may be thickened, or not, just as 
you prefer. It is not necessary to turn them. 

VEAT^ CITTI^ETS. 

Fry until pretty well done, then take out and dip into 
beaten egp;, and tlien in rolled cracker, with salt stirred 
in, and fry again, turning so as to get a nice brown on 
each side. JSIake a gravy of water and a spoonful of 
flour, in the frying-pan, and pour over. Season, if not 
salted enough ; tomatoes are nice, served with cutlets. 

PORK TEXDEREOI^. 

Have the spider hot, grease it with a bit of lard, and 

fry both sides brown, but do not cook them through ; 

cover with boiling water, and stir twenty minutes or a 

half hour ; thicken the gravy, and season with pepper 

and salt. The meat will taste like chicken, and is every 

bit as good. 

MOCK DUCK. 

Prepare a good dressing, such as you like for turkey 

or duck. Take a round steak, pound it, but not very 

hard, spread the dressing over it, sprinkle in a little salt, 

l^epper, and a few bits of butter. Lap over the ends, 

roll the steak up tightly, and tie closely ; spread two 

large spoonfuls butter over the steak after rolling it up, 

then wash with a well beaten egg; put water in a bake- 

pan, lay in the steak so as not to touch the water, and 



ME A 2;s. 25 

bake as you would a duck, bastinf^ often. A half hour 

in a brisk oven will bake. Make a blown grav}', and 

send to table hot. 

BAK£D ]IA:fI. 

Slice as for frying, put in hot skillet, cover, put in 
oven and bake. Will require little more time than to 
fry. — 3Ilss JVannit lup.ser, Fayidte^ Mo. 

SAISAGE. 

One hundred pounds of meat, ground fine, two and 
one-half pounds of salt, ten ounces of black pepper, 
eight ounces of sage. Mix well. You can use a little 
red pepper, if you like; one-half dozen nutmegs is a 
gieat improvement. — Mrs. M. Pile., Fayette., Mo. 

BEKF HASH. 

Equal ciuantities of meat, and potatoes, a small onion, 
slice of breakfast bacon, or lump of butter. Boil an 
hour. Pour a little cream in a few minutes before

Chop the meat fine, sejison with salt and pepper, and 
a piece of butter size of an ^gg, a small onion, chopped 
line ; put in a tin baking pan ; n, layer of meat and a 
layer of biead crumbs ; i)our over the whole a cuj:) of 
cream, or rich milk ; put in the oven, and bake slowly, 
until a nice brown. — JSlllie Keyscr, Fayette., Mo. 
BEEF C ROQl ETTES. 

Use cold roast beef; chop it line ; season with pepper 
and salt; add one-third the quantity of bread crumbs, 
and moisten with a little milk. Have your hands 
floured; rub the meat into balls; dip it into beaten 
^%g, then into line pulverized crackers, and fry in but- 
ter; garnish with paisley. To pulverize the crackers 
roll them with the rolling-pin on the bread board, and 
sift them.

SWEET-BREAI>S. 

Veal sweet-breads are best. As they spoil ver}^ soon, 

they should as soon as brought from market be put in 

cold water and left to soak an hour; then lard them, 

and put them in boiling water, or stock, and let them 

boil twenty minutes. They will be white and firm. 

Remove the skin, and put in a cool place until ready to 

cook again. 

FRIED SWEET-BKEADS. 

Parboil them, as just explained; cut them in even 
sized pieces ; sprinkle over pepper and salt ; egg and 
bread crumb them, and fry them in hot lard. 

VEAE EOAF. 

Six Boston crackers, three eggs, one tablespoonful of 
salt, pepper, and sage, or summer savory ; three pounds 
of veal. The veal must be raw, and chopped fine ; mix 
all well together and pack it hard in a deep tin pan; 
bake slowly for one hour; a tablespoon of butter im- 
proves it. This is a nice relish for tea, and should be 

sliced thin when cold. 

OPOSSIM. 

Clean like a pig, scrape, not skin it. Chop the liver 
fine ; mix with bread crumbs, chopped onion, and pars- 
ley, with pepper and salt ; bind with a beaten egg, and 
stuff the body with it. Sew up, roast, baste with salt 
and water. In order to have it crisp, rub it over w^ith a 
cloth, dipped in its own grease. Serve with the gravy, 
made of brown flour. Serve it whole on a platter, and 
put a baked apple in its mouth. — Judge, T. R. BeAts-, 
Fay Me, Mo. 

BABBIT STEW. 

Skin, clean, and cut in small pieces two rabbits. Let 
them stand in cold salt water for an hour ; then put 
on to cook, in enough cold water to cover them, and 
boil till tender. Season with salt and pepper, and stir 
one tablespoon of butter, made smooth, with two table- 
spoons of flour, into the gravy. 



MEATS. 27 

SOUSE. 

Having cleaned the pigs' feet perfectly, and removed 
the skin and bones, chop line ; season with salt, pepper, 
and a little sage. Mould in a pan. When cold it can 
be sliced, and vinegar poured over it. 

MGS' FEET. 

Boil them until done thoroughly, then split the claws, 
and fry them in batter; just dipped into the batter. 
Batter. — One-half pint of milk, one egg, little salt, flour 
enough to make it a little thicker than flapjacks ; fry 
them in hot lard. 

BEEFSTEAK BAEES. 

One and a half pounds of round steak, chopped flne ; 
two eggs, one tablespoon of flour, two tablespoons of 
milk ; salt and pepper to taste ; drop in spider and fry 
until done. — Jliss Cora Jones, Sf/racuse, N. Y. 

TO PICKEE OXE HEIM^DRED POEXDS OF BEEF 
OR TOAGEE. 

Sprinkle the bottom of tub, or flrkin, with salt. Four 
pounds of brown sugar, four ounces of saltpetre, four 
quarts of flne Liverpool salt. Mix well together, and in 
packing sprinkle evenly over the meat. The dissolving 
of salt and juice of meat will be sufficient to pickle. 
Keep the meat closely pressed together with a good 
weight. — Mrs. Nettie Gannett, Fayette, Mo. 

TO CERE BAC'OX. 

For every three hundred pounds of pork use fourteen 
pounds of common salt, and one pound each of brown 
sugar and saltpetre. Rub them into the meat, and let 
it lie for three weeks, rubbing and turning it occasion- 
ally. Then wipe dry, rub again with flne salt, wrap it 
in a thick cloth, or paper; hang in cool place to dry.

DIRECTIONS. 

All poultry should be carefully picked, and the liair 
singed off by holding the bird over a lighted piece of 
paper. Take care in removing that the gall bag and the 
gut joining the gizzard are not broken. Open the giz- 
zard, first take out the contents, and detach the gall 
bladder from the liver. If poultry is brought from 
market frozen, do not hasten to thaw it out before it is 
wanted for use ; till then put in a cold place, and let it 
remain frozen. When you thaw it use only cold water. 
Any frozen poultry, or meat, thawed in warm water, 
will most certainly spoil. Food of any kind, which has 
been frozen, requires a much longer time to cook. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

The secret of having a good roast turkey is to baste 
it often, and to cook it long enough. First, then, after 
the turkey is dressed, season it well, sprinkling pepper 
and salt on the inside : stutf it, and tie it well in shape ; 
sprinkle it well with pepper and salt. It is well to allow a 
turkey to remain some time stuffed before cooking. Pour 
a little boiling water into the bottom of the dripping-pan. 
If it is to be roasted, do not have the oven too hot, right 
at first, until it gets well heated through, then gradually 
increase the heat. The excellence of the turkey de- 
pends much upon the frequency of basting it. Make a 
dressing of cold bread crumbs, mixed with one-half 
pound of butter; use no water in the dressing, and 
season iDtll with pepper and salt. After stuflfing the 
turkey well put some of the dressing in the pan, so as 

31 



32 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 

to make a richer gravy. Put in the pan with the tnrkey 
the giblets, also, to which add a little more than a pint 
of water. Oysters may be added to the dressing, if 
preferred. A turkey weighing fourteen pounds should 
be cooked fou7' hours. — Mrs. 31. Heudrlx. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

After the turkej is dressed, season it well, sprinkling 
pepper and salt on the inside. Put the turkey in a 
large meat pan, almost half full of water. Let cook 
about two hours, turning occasionally. Then take it 
from the stove and stuff it with dressing, prepared as 
above. A little sage is an impiovement. Sprinkle 
well with pei)per, salt, and Hour. Place it in the oven 
and cook about two hours. If dinner is to be served at 
one o'clock, the turkey should be put on to cook at 
nine o'clock. — 3£rs. Elizabeth 3fajoi\ Fayette, Mo. 

BAKED CTUCKEX. 

If the chickens are young boil about twenty minutes. 
Prepare the dressing the same as for turkey, and bake 
in the same manner. Slice two hard boiled eggs in the 
gravy. — 3Irs. 31. Bridges, Fayette, 3Io. 

FRIED CHICKED. 

Clean, wash, and cut to pieces a couple of spring 
chickens ; soak in salt water more than one hour, wipe 
dry, season with pepper, and dredge with flour. Then 
fry in hot lard, until each piece is a nice brown on both 
sides. Take up, drain, and set aside in a hot, covered 
dish. Pour into the gravy left in the frying-pan- a cup 
of milk, half cream is better ; thicken with heaping 
spoonful of flour, and tablespoonful of butter ; cut pas- 
try, rolled thin in squares, or strips ; fry a nice brown, 
and lay on dish with chicken, and pour gravy over all. 
Serve. — Mrs. J. Keyser.

SMOTHERED CHICKEX. 

For smothered chicken, the fowl must be split down 
the back, washed, and wiped dry. Lay it breast up- 
ward in baking pan ; pour over it a ]3int and a half of 
boiling water, in which has been dissolved a heaping 
tablespoonful of butter ; cover with another pan that 
fits exactly. Cook slowly for half an hour, then baste 
plentifully with the butter water in the pau ; cover, and 
leave about twenty minutes. Baste again, and once 
more in another quarter of an hour. An hour and a 
quarter is long enough for a 3^oung fowl. Baste the 
last time with a tablespoonful of butter, cover, and 
leave in the oven about ten minutes longer. It should 
be of a tine yellow brown all over, not crisped any- 
where. Thicken the gravy with a tables]30onful of 
browned tiour, and pour over the chicken. The Hour 
should first be wet with a little cold milk, or water, and 
rubbed smooth. — Ilrs. Jacob Keyser, Fayette, Mo. 

PRAIRIE CmCKEXS— STEAMED OR BAKED. 

Stuff them, after cleaning, with a dressing of bread 
crumbs, and seasoning of pepper and salt, and mixed 
with melted butter. Sage, onion, or summer savorj^ 
may be added, if liked. Secure the fowl firmly Avitli a 
needle and twine. Steam in a steamer until tender; 
then remove to a dripping-pan ; dredge with fiour, pep- 
per, and salt, and brown delicately in tlie oven. Baste 
with melted butter ; garnisli with parsley, and lumps 
of currant jell}^ Prairie fowls may be stewed, or 
broiled, the same as other birds. — From Mrs. Owens'' 
Coolc BooTi. 

ROAST DICKS. 

Ducks should be cooked, and the dressing the same 
as chicken or turkey. If the ducks are tender, they 
will not require more than an hour and a half to roast. 
The giblets should be chopped fine, and added to the 
gravy, with a chopped shallet, and a spoonful of browned 
flour. 



34 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 

QUAItS WITH TOAST. 

After dressing, split the quails down the back ; le.t 
them soak in salt water half an hour, or more, then put 
in the meat pan. Season with salt, pepper, and butter ; 
about a pint of water ; baste often ; toast bread, cut in 
squares, a light brown ; lay toast on meat dish. Place 
the quails, after they have cooked, and are browned 
nicely, on the toast, and pour gravy over all. 

CHICKEX PIE. 

First cut the chicken up, and stew in a sauce-pan 
until almost, or quite done; then have a deep dish, or 
pan, lined with pastry ; put in a layer of chicken, sea- 
soned with butter, pepper, and salt , then cut strips of 
pastry, and lay across ; put another layer of chicken, 
seasoned ; put a cover of pastry, notched, round the 
edges, and cut a cross in the center. — Mrs. E. 3Iajor, 
Fayette, Mo.

of two eggs, stir in two tablespoons of soft (not melted) 
butter to a smooth paste ; then add a teaspoonful of 
salt, a tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce, and the 
beaten whites of the eggs, mix well with the meat and 
rice, and mould into croquettes. Beat two eggs, and 
pour over the croquettes, then roll them in cracker 
dust, seasoned with pepper and salt. Boil until a light 
brown, in lard, which should be quite hot, and deep 
enough to cover them. Serve with French peas, heap- 
ing the peas in the center of the platter, and arranging 
the croquettes around the edge. — Miss Jos epliine Har- 
rison., Denver, Col.

CIIICKEX C'ROUIIETTKS. 

(For one dozen medium sized croquettes.) Boil your

is long enough for the brains to boil, then throw them 
right in the cold water, and skin them, one -half cup 
suet, chopped fine, one-half small onion, and two sprigs 
of parsley, chopped together very fine, juice of half a 
lemon, mix all together, and add enough cream to shape 
into croquettes. Be careful not to have it too soft. If 
you mould them pear shape, add a clove in one end, 
and a small sprig of parsley in the other. This is done 
after they are cooked. They must be rolled in eggs or 
cracker crumbs, and fried in boiling lard. Serve with 
tomato sauce. — Mrs. Lizzie Findley,, St. Louis, Mo.

MASHED POTATOES. 

Pare and boil the potatoes ; when done, drain off the 
water ; let them stand a minute in the stove to let all 
the steam escape; add the salt and butter, and mash 
them free from lumps ; add sweet cream, or milk ; beat 
like cake batter, the longer the better, until nice and 
light ; serve in a covered dish. 

POTATO CAKES. 

Make cold mashed potatoes into fiat cakes, flour them, 

and fry in jiart lard and part butter, until they are a 

light brown. 

TO BOIIi 5fEW POTATOES. 

Scrape the skins from new j)otatoes, and lay them in 
cold water for a while, put them into a saucepan, and 
cover them with water ; cover them, and boil for about 
half an hour ; try one, and if done, drain the water off; 
make a sauce of hot milk, thickened with flour, and 
seasoned with butter, salt and pepper ; pour over the 
potatoes, and serve hot. 

SARATOGA POTATOES.

time into a skillet of boiling lard, taking care that 
they do not strike together, stir with a fork till they are 
a light brown color, take out with a wire spoon, drain 
well, and serve in an open dish. They are very nice 
served cold.

TO BAKE POTATOES. 

The potatoes must be of equal size. Put them into a 
hot oven, and bake until tender. It requires about an 
hour to bake a large potato. Serve immediately ; if 
left to stand they are not good. 

FRIE1> POTATOES. 

Peel, and cut the potatoes in thin slices, as nearly the 
same size as possible ; put into a frying pan some lard, 
or butter, and when quite hot put in the potatoes, fry 
on both sides until they are a nice brown. AVhen they 
are crisp, and done, take them up; place them on a 
cloth before the fire to drain the grease from them, and 
serve very hot, after sprinkling with salt. 

POTATOES BAKED IVITH BEEF. 
Pare potatoes of equal size, and put them into the 
oven in the same pan in which the beef is baked. In 
basting the beef the potatoes should be basted also. 
Serve them around the beef. 

POTATO CROQIETTES. 
Season cold mashed potatoes with pepper, salt, and 
nutmeg. Beat to a cream, and to every cup of potato 
put a tablespoonful of melted butter. Bind with two or 
three beaten eggs, and add some minced parsley. Roll 
into oval balls, dip into beaten egg, then in bread 
crumbs, and fry in hot lard, or drippings. Pile in a 
pyramid on a flat dish, and serve. 

POTATO PUFFS. 
To two cups mashed potatoes put two spoons melted 
butter ; beat until creamy. Then add two well beaten 
eggs, and a cup of cream, or milk, a little salt ; beat

quite half an inch thick. Put in a baking pan, with a 
very little water; sprinkle white sugar thickly over 
them, and spread each slice with butter ; set them in 
the stove to brown. A longer time is required for cook- 
ing sweet potatoes than Irish potatoes. 

TO BAKE SWEET POTATOES. 

Select those that are nearly of a size, not too large; 
wash them, and put in a hot oven, and bake until done; 
it requires about an hour to bake a medium sized 
potato. 

BAKED TOMATOES. 

Peel the tomatoes by pouring boiling water over 
them, until the skin will slip, cut out the stem end, set 
them in a baking pan ; season with salt, pepper, butter 
size of an egg, and sugar; sprinkle over them a good 
handful of bread crumbs ; bake slowly for forty-five 
minutes. 



The following recipe is given by Mrs. Martha Jack- 
son, by which tomatoes may be so preserved that they 
may be sliced and served as fresh tomatoes : 

Take the imperfect tomatoes, put in a tin or porcelain 
kettle, let come to a boil, mash well, run through a 
colander, then take the juice, place on the fire, put in 
whole tomatoes, if not too large, if so, cut in half ; let 
them get entirely heated, put in cans ; seal while hot. 

STUFFED TOMATOES. 

Select enough large, smootli tomatoes, to fill a baking 
dish ; cut a piece from the top of each, scoop out the 
pulp, without breaking the skin ; make a dressing by 
adding to pulp bits of cold beef, or mutton, chopped 
fine, bread crumbs, salt, pepper, and onion ; after put- 
ting sugar, and small piece of butter in the skins, fill 
them with this dressing, replace the tops, and bake 
until done. — 3Irs. R. P. Williams, Fayette, Mo.

FRICASSEED CHICKEIT. 

Cut fresh corn from tlie cob, put in a pot, and just 
cover with boiling water ; let it boil half an hour ; mix 
in a half pint of cream, a tablespoonful of l)utter. one of 
sugar, a little salt, and pepper, and let boil a few 
minutes. 

GREEX CORX PI DDIXG. 

One dozen ears of green corn, grated from the rob, or 
sliced off, then take the knife and scrape the cob for the 
sweetest part of the corn ; beat up well three eggs, add 
a pint of sweet milk, half cup of butter, one spoonful of 
sugar, pepper, and salt, stir in the corn, bake in a pud- 
ding pan, in a well heated oven. — MiS. J. D. Tolson. 

TO BOIIi CORX 03f THE COB. 

The corn is boiled in the husks, which imparts sweet- 
ness and havor, and keeps it moist and tender. The 
unhusked corn is put into salted boiling water, and 
when done drain well. Remove the husks before send- 
ing to the table. 

PEAS. 

First boil the pods, which are sweet and full of flavor, 
in a little water ; skim them out, and add the peas, 
which boil until tender; add then a little butter, cream, 
pepiDer, and salt. Time to cook, about half an hour. 

CABBAGE TO BOII^. 

Cabbage is best boiled, and served with corned beef; 
otherwise boil a piece of pork with it. Always boil 
with it a piece of red pepper. Remove the outside dam- 
aged leaves, and cut the cabbage into halves, or, if very 
large, into quarters, so as to better cook the inside stalk ; 
put it into the boiling water, with the corned beef, or 
pork, and the small red pepper. It will take from half to 
three-quartei s of an hour to be well cooked. Drain the 
cabbage well, serving it with meat, in the center of the 
dish.

CABBAGE PUDDIXO. 

Chop cabbage, and boil till tender, in clear water, 
with salt enough to season ; when done drain off the 
water, put in a pudding dish a layer of bread and cab- 
bage, alternately ; season with butter, pepper, and 
cream, or rich milk; put in oven, and bake to a light 
brown. This makes a most delicious and delicate dish 
of cabbage. — Miss Nannie Keyser, Fayette,^ Mo. 

TO COOK CABBAGE aUICKI.A\ 

Cut up your cabbage tolerably line, then put it in 
real hot lard; then cover with water, and let boil ; sea- 
son with pepper, and salt. Before serving stir in a 
little bit of soda, and a teaspoon of liour. — Mrs. W. F. 
Tieman., Fayette, Mo. 

SOUTHERX CABBAGE. 

Scald cabbage in salt water until tender; drain, and 
just cover with cream ; when cream boils, sprinkle a 
tablespoon of Hour; then stir in an egg well beaten, and 
two or three tablespoons of sugar ; add all of the butter 
you can spare, only allow it to boil an instant after the 
Q^g is in, and as you take it from the stove pour in half 
a teacup of vinegar, more or less, according to strength, 
and a little pepper. — Mrs. John Tippett, Keytesmlle, 
Mo. 

BOIEED CABBAGE.

stove. When done add lialf cup of vinegar, if liked. 

SOLTIIKRN RICE. 

To one teacup of rice put one quart of water, and one 
spoonful of salt ; cook until the grains are done, but not 
soft, or broken, which will take about twenty minutes ; 
drain off all the water, and set on the back of the stove. 
Keep it tightly covered, and do not stir at any time, as 
stirring breaks the grains, and makes it sticky. If 
properly cooked when turned into the dish, each grain 
will be whole, and will not stick together ; it is much 
better than when all in a musli. — Mrs. M. J. Brealcer, 
Fayette, Mo. 

I.IMA BEAXS. 

Boil about an hour ; p^ur the water off; season with 
salt, pepi)er, and butter; send to the table hot. Dried 
Lima beans must be soaked over night, and boiled two 
hours, or until they are soft, and should have some 
cream added to the dressing. 

BAKED PORK AXD BEANf!i. 

Boil with one quart of dry beans a pound of salt 
pork. Put them on in cold water and boil until beans 
are tender, but not mashed. Place the beans in a 
baking dish ; lay the pork in the center, on top of 
beans. Bake in a slow oven till all are nicely browned. 

MACAROXI. 

Bake a quarter of a pound of macaroni until tender. 

To two well-beaten eggs add a little more than a pint of

and boil cobs for a few minutes with the beans ; when 
the beans are done stir the corn with the beans, and add 
one cup of cream, one tablespoonful of butter, one tea- 
spoonful of sugar, salt, and pepper to taste ; the corn 
should cook twenty minutes. A small piece of salt 
pork, cooked with the beans, is a great improvement. 

BOII.£I> BEETS. 

Wash, without breaking the skin; put to cook in 
boiling water; boil till done. Slice and season with 
butter, salt and pepper. Do not put on the vinegar, as 
many prefer them without.

weeping of the eyes will be avoided. Put to cook in 
boiling water. Boil a few minutes, then drain off the 
water, put on more water, and boil again ; and still a 
third, where they may remain till tender. This renders

them mild in flavor. When the last water is poured off, 
add a cup of milk, and seasoning of butter, pepper, and 
salt. Boil up, and serve. The milk helps to relieve 
them of their offensiveness. Onions are very healthful, 
and it would be better for the generality of people if 
they ate them oftener. — Mrs. Owens- Cook Book. 

FRI£I> EGG PliA^fT. 

Pare, and cut in slices half an inch thick ; sprinkle a 
little salt on each side, and press down, for an hour ; 
then rinse in clear water, and dry well with a towel ; 
dip in egg and rolled cracker, and fry a nice brown.

slices ; then the butter and sugar ; then slices ; so on 
until the dish is full. Pour in water enough to make a 
syrup, and bake. — Hiss Lou Smith, Fayette, Mo. 

SAI.SIFY. 

Having scraped the salsify roots, and washed them in 
cold water, parboil them ; then take them out ; drain 
them ; cut them into large pieces, and fry them in butter. 
Salsify is frequently stewed slowly till quite tender, and 
then served up with melted butter ; or it may be first 
boiled, then grated, and made into cakes, to be fried in 
butter. Salsif}^ must not be left exposed to the air, or 
it will turn blackish. 

CAlTI^IFIiOWER. 

Trim off the outside leaves, and put the cauliflower 
into well salted boiling water. Be careful to take it out 
as soon as tender, to jDrevent it dropping into pieces. 
Make in a saucepan a white sauce, in this way : Put 
butter the size of an ^^^ into the saucepan, and when 
it bubbles, stir in a scant half teacupful of flour ; stir 
well until cooked, then add two teacupfuls of thin 
cream, some pepper and salt ; stir it over the fire until 
perfectly smooth ; pour the sauce over the cauliflower, 
and serve.

OMELETTE. 

For a small family, take six eggs, beat the yellows 
and whites separately. Put the eggs together, and 
beai for a few minutes ; add a little salt and pepper, if 
you like. If 3^ou have cold boiled ham at any time, 
chop some flne, and put it in ; it makes the omelette 
very nice. Cook in a stewpan well greased with butter. 
—Mrs. E. W. Bedford. 

OMEEETTE. 

In the flrst place, be sure your eggs are fresh, or you 
will fail. Break them into an earthen dish, and beat 
just enough to mix the whites and yolks together 
nicely, then add a tablespoonful of sweet milk, or 
cream, for every egg, and then beat thoroughl}^ as you 
would for sponge cake. Have your pan perfectly dry, 
and hot enough to melt, but not to brown your butter ; 
turn in your omelette, and place over the fire at once, 
but be careful it does not burn. Take a thin-bladed 
knife and run carefully under the bottom, to let what is

solid, or you will have it hard and dry, as its own heat 
will cook it some time after it is taken up ; commence 
at one side and carefully roll over and over until the 
whole is in a roll. Let it brown a nice brown. Turn 
out on a hot dish, and serve. Do not put on a grain of 
salt while cooking, or it will be tough and flat. The 
butter, if well salted, will make it salt enough. — Mrs. 
L. Coolc, Fayette, Mo. 

CHEESE OMEIiETTE. 

Six eggs, one cup <>f grated cheese, pepper and salt 
to taste ; beat all together about one minute. Have a 
bright, smooth frying-pan ; let it heat well, and put in 
a piece of fresh butter, size of half an e,gg ; now pour on 
your beaten eggs ; stir from one side to the other with a 
spoon, until they are set. It is then ready to serve. 
With a quick movement of the cake lifter, throw one 
half over the other, then slide on a warm platter, and 
eat while hot. — Mrs. J. R. Findley, St. Louis., Mo. 

SCRAMBIiED EGGS. 

Six eggs beaten hard a few minutes ; a good pinch of 
salt and pepper ; a half teacup of rich milk ; a table- 
spoon of melted butter; have your skillet quite hot, 
and well greased ; pour in the mixture, and begin stir- 
ring at once ; keep stirring well from the bottom, till it 
is well set, which will be in a few seconds, then empty 
into a warmed dish, and keep closely covered. It 
should be prepared just before going to table. — Miss

POACHED £OOS. 

Break the eggs into boiling water, and sprinkle salt 
over them. When the white is well set, take them out ; 
pour over a little melted butter ; season with pepper . 
Serve on buttered toast, if you prefer. 

SCRAMBL-ED EGGS. 

Beat six or eight eggs very light ; add a little salt ; 
put them into a warm frying-pan, with butter, or lard ; 
stir until they are well thickened, but not hard; season 
with pepper. 

TO FRY EGGS. 

Melt a piece of butter in a frying pan ; put the eggs 
in carefully, so as not to break the yolks ; sprinkle with 
salt, and as soon as the whites are set, serve on a hot 
dish. The butter should not be allowed to get too hot, 
and only a couple of eggs should be fried at a time. A 
small frying-pan should be used. 

TO PREPARE EGGS FOR lilJNCH. 

To boil the eggs, put them in cold water, which will 
prevent them bursting, as they would if they were put 
in hot water to boil. When done put them in cold 
water, so the shell will come off nicely. Cut them in 
halves, lengthwise ; remove the yellows ; mash them 
up, and season with butter, pepper, salt, celery seed and 
a little vinegar. Put the yellows back into the whites, 
and put the halves together. You have a very pretty 
dish if you will tie around each one a piece of narrow 
blue ribbon. 

OYSTER OMEIiETTE. 

Beat six eggs to a thick cream ; season with pepper 
and salt ; have ready one dozen large oysters ; cut them 
in half; pour the eggs in a pan, with hot butter in it;

light brown, and serve hot. 



54 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 

STUFFED FOGS. 

Boil the eggs hard; and cut them in two ; take out 

carefully the yolks, which mash well, adding a little 

finely minced onion, chopped parsley, pepper, and salt. 

Mash also double the quantity of bread, which has 

been soaked iu milk ; mix bread, yolks, etc., together ; 

then bind them with a little raw j^olk of egg ; taste to 

see if they are seasoned properly. Stuff the eggs with 

the mixture, so that each half has the appearance of 

containing a whole round yolk; smooth the remainder 

of the mixture on the bottom of a pie pan ; arrange the 

halves symmetrically in this bed ; brown a little in the 

oven. 

TO KEEP EGGS. 

Put a two inch layer of salt in bottom of stone jar ; then 

a layer of fresh eggs, small end down ; then salt, then 

eggs, and so on till jar is full, with a layer of salt at 

top ; cover and put in a cool place, but not where they 

will freeze. This is a simple, easy, and inexpensive 

way, and has been tested for years. 

CRACKED WHEAT. 

Rinse thoroughly with cold water; two teacups of 
wheat ; add four cups of cold water ; place the pan in a 
pan of water, and cover closely. In half an hour or so

L.IOHT BR£AD. 

One quart of flour; two tablespoons yeast; one small 
tablespoon lard ; one teaspoon salt ; mix up with cold 
water and knead the dough well ; when the dough is 
risen very light, knead the second time, and make into 
loaves and light rolls, and let rise again. Bake one 
hour. — Mrs. Dr. Snelson, St. Joseph, Mo. 

TO MAKE YEAST AXD I^IGHT BREAD. 

Boil two or three small potatoes; mash them; add a 
pint of flour, and scald it with the water in which the 
potatoes were boiled ; then stir to a stiff batter, and 
when cool, add more water, until thinner; then add 
your baker's yeast, or soak a cake of dry yeast and 
put in a warm place to rise ; do not use the yeast as 
soon as it rises to the top of the bowl, but wait until it 
falls again, then it is ready for use ; one cup of this 
yeast will be sufiicient to make a pan of rolls or a loaf 
of bread. You can either keep this yeast fresh on ice, 
or make it into dry yeast-cakes, hy adding enough 
cornmeal to make stiff", cool and cut in square cakes ; 
dry thoroughly, then put in a sack and keep in a dry 
place. When you want to make light bread, make a 
sponge over night, of a pint or more flour, with luke- 
warm water, and add one or two cold potatoes, mashed 
fine, add either a cup of fresh yeast or a cake of dry 
yeast, soaked ; set in a warm place and let rise. The

early in the morning, and at four o'clock make out the 
rolls. (In making out the rolls or loaves, never add 
any more flour, it will make the bread tough). Set in 
some warm place to rise. In baking, put a pan of 
water on the grate to keep them from browning too 
quickly on top. 

For the yeast, take about three good-sized potatoes ; 
peel, and boil until done; take out of the water and 
mash until smooth ; mix small teacup of flour with 
potatoes; pour the water in which the potatoes were 
boiled into this, and beat until smooth ; put over the 
fire and cook as you would starch, stirring constantly ; 
only requires a few minutes to cook. Dissolve a cake 
of National yeast in a little cold water, and stir into the 
above when cold. This yeast makes better bread a day 
or two after it is made. — Mrs. E. Major, Fayette, Mo.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

If a pudding is to be boiled or steamed, always have 
the Avater boiling before the j)udding is put in. Do not 
allow it to stop boiling for an instant while the pudding- 
is cooking. Puddings are boiled in cloths, or in moulds, 
tied in cloths : they should be tied tightly, and the 
moulds be buttered before the puddings are put in 
them. A pudding cloth should be made of thick twilled 
muslin, and alwaA^s before using it, wash it out in clean 
water, and flour it well before pouring in the pudding, 
allowing room for the pudding to swell. Puddings are 
much nicer and lighter steamed than boiled. Have the 
steamer hot before putting in the j)udding. All pud- 
dings in which berries are used, require more flour than 
those without ; audit must be remembered, fruit (dusted 
with a little flour) should always be added the last thing. 
All puddings, of the custard kind, require a very gentle 
oven. Those made of batter should be put into one suf- 
ficiently brisk to raise them quickly, without scorching 
them. Such as contain suet and fruit, must have a well 
heated, but not fierce oven. Always be sure and butter 
the dish well, before the pudding is turned in.

GENEEAL DIRECTIONS. 

In making cake it is quite necessary that the 
materials be of the best quality. Sweet butter, fresh 
eggs and good flour are the first requisites. Never al- 
low the butter to oil : put it in an earthen dish and add 
your sugar; beat them to a cream, add the yolks of 
eggs well beaten, then the milk, and lastly the beaten 
whites of the eggs and flour. Spices and liquors may 
be added after the yolks of the eggs are put in, and the 
fruit put in with the flour. 

For small cakes the oven should be pretty hot; for 
larger cakes a moderate one. To ascertain if a large 
cake is sufficiently baked, pierce it with a broom straw 
or knitting needle, if done, the straw will come out free 
from dough ; if not, the dough will adhere to it. To 
prevent the cake browning too soon, have a paste-board 
with a few holes made in it (with a fork), lay on the 
top of the pan. Newspaper will not answer, being too 
light and inflammable. If it is necessary to turn or 
move the cake in the oven, do it very gently. If the 
oven is too hot, do not leave the door open, but lift one 
of the stove lids off a little way, for a short time. Never 
put the cake away until cold. 

ICINO BOIL£D. 

One pound of the nicest white sugar, crushed or 
crystalized, not 'powdered. Four very large spoon- 
fuls of water. I use a large kitchen spoon. Boil until 
the water is all out. Then pour slowly on the whites of 
92 



CAKES. 93 

four eggs that have been beaten to a stiff froth. Flavor 
with extract of lemon or almond if you prefer. Add a 
drop of blueing vrater ; and if you wish the icing to dry 
quickly a little pulverized citric acid. 

If cake is well dredged with tiour after baking, and 
then carefully wiped before the icing is put on, it will 
not run, andean be spread more smoothly. The cake 
after being iced should be set in a cool, dry place to dry. 
Mrs. Dr. T. J. Smith. Fayette. Mo. 

ICIWG COI.D. 

Beat whites of two eggs to a stiff froth ; add gradually 
half a pound of best pulverized sugar ; beat well for at 
least half an hour; flavor with lemon juice, (some add 
tartaric acid, as both whiten the icing). To color a 
delicate pink, use strawberry, currant or cranberry ; 
the grated peel of an orange or lemon, moistened with 
the juice and strained through a thin cloth, will give it 
a handsome yellow. This amount will frost one large 
cake.— Jlfr^. H. A. Norn's. 

CHOC'OIiATE ICIXG. 

One teacup of grated chocolate, two cups of white 
sugar, half a cup of sweet milk. Boil until it ropes ; 
then beat until cool the whipped whites of four eggs 
into it.— Mrs. E. P. Williams, Fayette, Mo. 

ICOO WITHOUT £GGiS. 

To one heaping teaspoonful of corn starch, with just 
enough cold water to dissolve it, add a little hot water, 
and cook in a basin set in hot water, till very thick. 
Stir in two and two- third cups of pulverized sugar, while 
the starch is hot ; flavor to taste, and spread on cake 
while it is hot. This will never crumble in cutting.— 
Mrs. J. H. Firiks, Salisbury, Mo.

GENERAL DIEECTIONS FOR CANDY MAKING. 

G-ranulated sugar is preferable. Candy should not 
be stirred while boiling. Cream tartar should not be 
added until the syruj) begins to boil. Butter should be 
put in when the candy is almost done. Flavors are more 
delicate when not boiled in the candy. 

VAWII.I.A CREAM CAXDY. 

Three cups of sugar, one and one-half cups of water, 
one-half teaspoon of cream tartar, butter size of a wal- 
nut; flavor with vanilla; boil until it begins to thread, 
or until the drops are somewhat brittle if dropped in 
cold water; pour into buttered platters, and when suffi- 
ciently cool, pull. 

If chocolate flavoring is desired, grate it over the hot 
candy, or place some melted chocolate in it before pull- 
ing. A pretty variety may be made by pulling the 
vanilla and chocolate candies together a few times ; 
thus leaving it striped. 

CREAM FOR BON BONS. 

Three cups of sugar, one and a half cups of water, 
one-half teaspoon of cream tartar; flavor with vanilla; 
boil until drops will almost keep their shape in water; 
then pour into a bowl, set in cold water; stir steadily 
with a silver or wooden spoon until cool enough to bear 
the hand ; then place on a platter and knead until of 
even texture ; if too hard, a few drops of warm water 
may be stirred in ; if too soft, it must be boiled again. 

114 



CONFECTIONERY. 115 



This is the general foundation of Cream Bon Bons ; it 
may be flavored witli chocolate, by adding a tablespoon 
of melted chocolate while the synii) is hot. 

TAFFY. 

Two cups of ])rown sugar, one-half cup of butter, four 
tablespoons of molasses, two tablespoons of water, two 
tablespoons of vinegar; boil until it strings; cover the 
bottom of a dish with nuts, and pour the candy over, 
and let it harden. 

BUTTER SCOTCH. 

Three pounds coffee A sugar, fourth pound butter, 
half teaspoon cream tartar, eight drops extract of 
lemon ; add as much cold water as will dissolve the 
sugar; boiling without stirring till it will easily break 
when dropped in cold water, and when done add the 
lemon ; have a dripping pan well buttered and pour in 
one-fourth inch thick, and when partly cold, mark off 
in squares. If pulled when partl}^ cold till very white, 
it will be like ice cream candy. 

COCOAXVT CARAMEIiS. 

One pint milk, butter size of an egg, one cocoanut 
grated fine, three pounds of white sugar, two teaspoons 
lemon; boil slowly until stiff, (some then beat to a 
cream) ; pour into shallow pans, and when partly cold 
cut in squares. 

HICKOBTSflJT MACAROONS.

half cup milk, one teaspoon cream of tartar, one-half of 
soda, flour enough to make a stiff dough ; drop on tins 
and sprinkle over with powdered sngar. Bake in a 

quick oven.

One large cocoanut, one and a half pounds of coffee 
sugar. Wet sugar with cocoanut milk ; when thorough- 
ly dissolved, put in the grated cocoanut; boil until it 
ropes; stir till it begins to grain; spread on platters. 
If boiled too hard, add a little water, and repeat pro- 
cess. — Marie Howard, Batama, N. Y. 

PEANUT CANDY.

FIG, DATE AND XUT CAXDY. 

Take the white of one large ^gg, and an equal 
quantity of cold water; put them together in a bowl 
(without beating the Qgg), and stir in confectioners' 
sugar, until thick enough to knead like bread dough; 
then flavor as desired, and mould in any shape wished. 
If not stift' enough after adding flavoring, put in a little 
more sugai-. The cream for the chocolates is made in 
the same way, "'Bitter Almond " being the best flavoring. 
Grate the chocolate and put in a pan which is set over 
the steam of a teakettle; when melted, drop the balls of 
cream in it, and when they are coated take out with a 
fork. Put them on the bottom of a tin pan, (that is, turn 
the pan upside down,) and put in a cool place ; a sharp, 
thin knife will remove them easil3^ The nut candy uses 
the same cream, mixing the nuts in it; and with the 
maple sugar candy, adding the grated maple sugar. 
Roll some of the cream balls in cinnamon. They are 
very nice. — Mrs. Mamie White Chinn., Howard county, 
Mo. 

SUGAR CAXDY. 

To six cups of sugar, take three cups of soft water, six 
teaspoons of vinegar ; stir until well dissolved before it 
is put on to cook. Let it cook until a little dropped in 
cold water will snap. Do not stir at all. When ready 
turn out on buttered plates, put in a cool place ; it can be 
handled in about Ave minutes. Pull quickly with the 
fingers, not with the hands. When it is white and be- 
gins to get brittle, stretch on a mixing-board and cut in 
lengths. If any essence is desired, put it in as it is cool- 
ing ; vanilla is best. — Mrs. B. F. Ferguson, Fayette, Mo. 

TO SVGAR OR CRYSTAtlZE POP-COR\. 

Put into an iron kettle one tablespoon of butter, three 
tablespoons of water, one teacup of white sugar; boil 
until ready to candy; then throw in three quarts of 



118 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 



corn, nicely popped ; stir briskly until the candy is 
evenly distributed over the corn ; set the kettle from the 
lire, and stir until it is cooled a little, and you will have 
each grain crystalized with sugar. Care should be 
taken not to have too hot a fire, lest you scorch the corn. 
N^uts of any kind may be treated the same way. 

SAIiTED PEAXrXS. 

Shell them; remove the skins; put them into a 
dripping pan, with just enough butter to make them 
glossy ; shake the pan frequently to make them brown 
evenly. When the nuts are brown, sprinkle with salt. 
Salted almonds are prepared the same way, except that 
their skins do not rub off so easily, but must be blanched 
by pouring boiling water over them.

TO PICKI.E CHERRIES. 

Fill a glass jar with large ripe cherries on the stems ;

Burton, Fayette, Mo. 



GENERAL DIEECTIONS. 

To insure success in preserving, the fruits must be 
carefully selected. Care should be taken to remove all 
bruised or decayed parts, as they would darken the 
syrup. Fruit requiring to be pared should be laid in 
water to preserve the color after paring. The best sugar 
is the cheapest. The usual proportion in making pre- 
serves is a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit; but in 
fruits not very acid, such as peaches, apples and pears, 
three-quarter of a pound to a pound of fruit is sufficient. 
The syrup should always be boiled and skimmed before 
putting in the fruit. Fruit should be cooked in brass 
kettles or those of bell metal. Modern kettles, lined 
with porcelain, are much used for this purpose. Never 
use tin, iron or pewter spoons as skimmers, as they will 
injure the color of the syrup and impart a very un- 
pleasant flavor. Glass jars are best for preserves, as 
the condition of the fruit can be observed more readily. 
They should be kept in a dark place, for the chemical 
action of light will aff'ect the quality of the preserves 
when perfectly air-tight. 

PRESERVED PEACHES. 

Weigh the peaches, and allow three-quarters of a 
pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. After they have 
been pared and the stone removed, sprinkle sugar over 
the fruit, and let it stand over night. In the morning 
drain off the syrup from the fruit; add the rest of the 
sugar, and let that come to a boil. Put the peaches in, 
and let them boil until you can stick a straw through 
them.

FRUITS. 127 

PRESERVED PEARS. 

Preserved pears aie put lip precisely as are peaches. 
Cut in halves and remove the core ; they can be more 
easily pared if boiling water is poured over them, and 
let stand for a while. 

PRESERVED QUIXCES. 

Use a pound of sugar to each pound of quinces, after 
paring, coring, and quartering ; take half of the sugar 
and make a thin syrup ; boil In this a fev7 of the quinces 
at a time till all are linished. Make a rich syrup of the 
remaining sugar, and pour over them. 

PRESERVED APPEES. 

Apples are preserved just the same as peaches, ex- 
cept when the fruit is added put in two or three pieces 
of race-ginger and several pieces of orange peel, cut in 

strips. 

PRESERVED CRAB APPEES. 

Wash and pick blows off, but leave stems on your 

crab apples. Take as many pounds of sugar as there 

are pounds of fruit ; add a little water to dissolve; put 

in part of fruit at a time; when the apples begin to 

crack, skim out into a jar ; when all are done boil syrup 

a few moments, and skim; then pour over fruit, keep 

dry and cool. 

PRESERVED C'lTRO!^. 

The citron can be pared, cored and sliced, or cut into 
fancy shapes with cutters which are made for the pur- 
pose. To six pounds of citron use six pounds of sugar, 
four lemons, and a quarter of a pound of ginger root. 
Put tlie slices of lemon into a preserving kettle and boil 
them for half an hour, or until they look clear in a little 
clear water ; then drain them ; save the water, and put 
the slices into anothei dish with a little cold water; 
cover tliem, and let them stand over night. In the morn- 
ing wrap the ginger root (bruised) in a thin muslin 



128 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 



cloth ; boil it in three pints of clear water until the water 
is highly flavored, when take out the bag of ginger. 
Having broken up the loaf sugar, put it into the pre- 
serving kettle with the ginger water. When the sugar 
is all melted set it over the fire ; boil and skim until no 
more scum rises ; then put in the pieces of citron and 
the juice of the lemons. Boil them in the syrup till all 
the slices are quite transparent. Do not allow them to 
break; when done put them into the jars, pouring the 
syrup carefully over them. If one desires to imitate the 
West Indies ginger preserve, the slices of lemon may 
not be added; yet they are a pretty addition. — From 
Mrs. Henderson^ s Cook Book. 

TOMATOE PRESERVES. 

Choose little red, plump-shaped tomatoes, if red pre- 
serves are desired; and the small yellow ones for yellow 
preserves. Peel and prick them with a large needle ; 
boil them slowly for half an hour in preserving syrup, 
with the juice of one lemon to every two pounds of 
tomatoes; add also a little bag of ginger root; then 
skim out the tomatoes; let them remain two or three 
hours in the sun to harden. Put the white of an Qg^ 
into the syrup ; boil and skim well, and pour it over 
the tomatoes. The old rule is a pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit. I prefer three-quarters of a pound of 
the former to a pound of the latter. The yellow tomatoes 
are preferable. 

GRAPE PRESERVES. 

Squeeze with your fingers the pulp from each grape. 
Put the pulps on the fire, and boil them until they are 
tender ; then press them through a colander, so that the 
seeds may be taken out; now add the skins to the pulps 
and juice. Put a cupful of sugar to a cupful of fruit, 
and boil all together until of a thick consistency. Green 
grape preserves are also nice. In managing the green 



FRUITS. 129 

grapes, halve them, and extract tlie seeds with a small 
knife. Pnt also a cup of sugar to a cup of fruit. Many 
prefer the green to the ripe grape preserves. 

STRAWBERRY PRESERVES. 

Select the berries as you would for the table. Allow 
one pound of sugar for each pound of berries ; add to 
the sugar just enough water to dissolve it well; let 
come to a boil ; then add the fruit, which must be boiled 
about half an hour; then lift the berries out, spread 
them on a dish, and, when the syru^D has boiled until 
thick, pour over the berries. Set them in the sun as you 
would jelly until cold. Put in glass jars and seal. — 
Mrs. Cyrus Tlioinpson, Belleville, 111. 

STRAWBERRY PRESERVES. 

Put the berries and sugar, pound for pound, into a 

preserving kettle, and heat slowly till the sugar is 

melted; then boil rapidly for twenty minutes and seal 

up hot. 

CAXDIED FRIITS. 

Boil peaches, pears, apricots, cherries, or almost any 
fruits dressed, in a thick syrup, made with a teacup of 
water to each pound of sugar, until tender. Let them 
remain two daj^s in the syrup ; then take them out, 
drain them, and sprinkle sugar over each piece sepa- 
rately. Dry them slowly in the sun or in an oven not 

too warm. 

RASPBERRY JAM. 

Use three-quarters of a pound of sugar to one pound 

of berries. Put sugar and berries in preserving kettle ; 

stir together and mash until there is syruj) enough to 

prevent burning. Let boil till, by takiug some out 

on a plate to try it, no juice gathers about it. Then 

put away in glass jars, or stone jar.s are very nice. 

BLACKBERRY JAM. 

You make exactly as raspberry jam. 



130 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 

MARIttAIiADES. 

To make marmalade, very ripe fruit should be 
chosen. For peach, pear, green grape, pine-apple, 
quince or plum, allow three-quarters of a pound of 
sugar to a pound of fruit. If the fruit is not very juicy 
add a little water. Stir almost constantly ; when the 
whole begins to look clear, and becomes thick b}^ cool- 
ing a portion of it on a plate, it is done, and must be 
put into jars at once. 

BRANDY PEACHES. 

Use cling-stone peaches ; yellow ones we like best. 
Peel them and cut around them to the stone, but not 
enough to divide them. Make a syrup with half a 
pound of sugar to each pound of fruit, and half a tea- 
cup of water for each pound of sugar ; skim as it boils 
as long as the scum rises ; then put in the peaches and 
boil until tender. Take them out carefully ; remove 
the syrup from the tire, and add one-half pint of best 
brandy to a pound of peaches. Pour this over the 
peaches. Seal in glass jars. 

PEACH BrTTEB. 

One peck of peaches, two quarts of boiled cider ; 
reduce by boiling one gallon of sweet cider to one-half 
its quantity ; pare and cut soft peaches, put into the 
preserving kettle with the cider; boil until they are 
reduced to a pulp, stirring constantly ; if not sweet 
enough, add a little sugar ; cover tight in jars. 

APPI.E JEttA . 

Take juicy apples (Ramboes are best), take the stem 
and top off and wash them nicely ; then cut up in quar- 
ters and put cold water on them, just enough to cover 
them ; boil them soft afterward ; strain them through a 
jelly bag; then take two pints at a time with two 
pounds of crushed sugar ; boil twenty minutes, then do 



FRUITS. 131 

tlie same with the other juice, to be economical; pare 
and core the apples ; don't strain so close but that you 
can, by adding- a little more water, use the apples for 
sauce or pies. 

APPI.E JEL.L.Y. 

Take nice green apples that will cook nicely ; quarter 
the apples without paring; put them in a pan or kettle 
and cover over with water, and keep them covered ; let 
them boil slowly until entirely done, then strain through 
a tlannel bag; just let it drip, do not squeeze them. 
To a pint of j nice put a pint of sugar. If the apples are 
not very acid, use a little citric acid. 



SIBERIAN CRAB APPLE JEI.IiY. 

Crab apple, gooseberry, quince, plum and apple, are 
all made in the same way ; some add less sugar to 
sweeter fruits. After having freed the fruit from all 
blemishes, put them in a preserving kettle with only 
enough clear water to keep them from burning ; let them 
boil slowly until quite soft ; then, putting them into a 
flannel cloth, press from them all the juice possible; 
strain the juice two or three times through a clean 
cloth, then return to a clean preserving kettle, adding 
a cup of sugar for every cup of juice, and the beaten 
white of an egg for the wiiole. The rule is to boil the 
syrup (without stirring) very rapidly for twenty 
minutes, not counting the minutes before it begins to 
boil. The surest way is to boil it until it runs a little 
thick upon the spoon, then let it run through the jelly 
bag without pressing it ; put the jelly into glasses, and 
after it has become quite firm, cut out little papers to 
fit the tops, which should be dipped in the whites of 
eggs ; press the edges against the sides of the glasses 
to exclude the air. 



132 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 

CURRAXT JELIiY. 

Weigh the currants ; do not wash them, but carefully 
remove leaves and whatever may adliere to them. To 
each pound of fruit allow half the weight of granulated 
or pure loaf sugar ; put a few currants into a porcelain- 
lined kettle, and press well, so as to secure sufficient 
liquid to prevent burning them; add the remainder of 
the fruit, and boil freely for twenty minutes, stirring 
occasionally to prevent burning ; strain through a flan- 
nel bag, into an earthen vessel, as the action of the 
acid on tin materially affects both color and flavor; 
when strained, return the liquid to the kettle without 
the trouble of measuring, and let it boil for a moment 
or so, and then add the sugar. As soon as the sugar is 
entirely dissolved, the jelly is done. Pour into glasses. 
Cut papers a little larger than the top, dip in whites of 
eggs ; press the edges against the sides of the glasses 
to exclude the air. 



iT^aXs^^s^x 



TO CAN TO:?I.iTOES. 

They must be fresh. Pour scakling water over them 
to aid in removing the skins. After the tomatoes are 
skinned, put them into a porcelain preserving kettle ; 
add no water to them ; let them come to boiling jjoint, 
or be well scalded through. The cans should be heated 
by filling them with boiling water, and allowing them 
to stand while the tomatoes are boiling. Pour out this 
water, fill the cans and seal while hot. Always have 
cans soldered if you can conveniently do so, but if you 
should have to use the wax, be very careful to perfectly 
exclude the air. There will be juice left after the toma- 
toes are canned. This can be seasoned and boiled 
down for catsup. 

CAKXED CORX. 

To seven pounds of corn, put three pints of water; 

let come to a boil, then add one ounce of tartaric acid ; 

stir it in well ; let it boil hard, and can while boiling. 

When you go to cook for table use, pour off the water 

that may be with it, and add fresh water or milk, and 

boil it also; to each quart can add ^a teaspoouful of 

soda, salt, butter, and a little sugar. — Mrs. H. A. Norris^ 

Fayette, Mo. 

TO CAX CORX. 

Mrs. Henderson says : " I have found in a Supreme 
Court decision, Mr. Winslow's receipt for canning corn, 
as follows : 

" Fill the cans with the uncooked corn (freshly gath- 
ered) cut from the cob, and seal them hermetically ; 

133 



134 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 

surround them with straw to prevent them striking 
against each other, and put them into a boiler over the 
tire, witli enougli cold water to cover them ; heat the 
water gradually, and when you have boiled an hour 
and a half puncture the tops of the cans to allow the 
escape of gases; ilien seal them immediately while 
they are still hot; continue to boil them for two hours 
and a half. In packing, tlie cut corn in the can, the 
liberated milk and juices surround the kernels, forming 
a liquid, in which they are cooked. This process, 
patented hj Mr. Winslow, is by far the best one for 
preserving the natural flavor of green sweet corn." — 
From, Mrs. Heitdersoii'H Cook Boole. 

TO CA:sr PEACHES. 

Pare, halve and stone them. Put them in a preserv- 
ing kettle; cover with water; add about a teacup of 
sugar; let them boil until peaches are clear; then take 
them carefully out of this water and put into cans ; 
pour over them a rich syrup, made of granulated sugar, 
and just enough water to dissolve well. Have them 
soldered while hot. 

Pears and apricots are canned in the same manner. 

CAXXED CHERRIES. 

Stone tlie fruit; weigh it ; and for every pound of fruit, 
take half a pound of sugar ; after putting the fruit into 
the syrup, let it scald (not boil hard) for ten or fifteen 
minutes, and then can and seal. This method is excel- 
lent for use, with all small fruits. 



-^^rAMIlY^^BWEKAGESs^ 



TEA. 

Two things are necessary to insure good tea. First, 
that the water should be at tlie boiling point when 
poured on the leaves ; water simply hot not answering 

he pui'pose at all. And second, that it should be 
served freshly made. Tea should never be boiled. So 
particular are the English to preserve its first aroma, 
that it is sometimes made on the table two or three 
times during a meal. In France, little silver canisters 
of tea are placed on tlie table, where it is invariably 
made. One teaspoonful of the leaves is a fair portion 
for each person. Tea is better made in an earthen tea- 
pot, which tea connoisseurs are particular to have. 
They also drink the beverage without milk, and with 
loaf-sugar merely. 

Water at the boiling point is generally considered 
better for tea or coffee, and in fact, any kind of cooking 
which requires boiling water. — From Mrs. Henderson^s 

Cooli Book. 

COFFEE. 

One mill full of coffee. When ground, put in coffee- 
pot, break into it one whole ^%^\ mix well with a little 
cold water ; then pour on boiling water, sufficient to fill 
an ordinary sized pot, three parts full ; set it back 
where it will simmer gently for fifteen minutes ; then 
set it where it will boil briskly about five minutes. Do 
not allow to boil over, stir it down and add a few drops 
of cold water. 

135 



136 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 

The best coffee is made by mixing two- thirds Java 
and one-third Mocha. Use, if you can, the Old Domin- 
ion coffee-pot. Serve with very thick cream. — 3Irs. Dr. 
T. J. SmitJi, Fayette, Mo. 

CHOCOIiATE. 

Scrape the chocolate and let it soak a little while in 
about a tablespoon of milk to soften it ; stir until 
smooth ; when the milk, sweetened to taste, is boiling, 
add it to the dissolved chocolate, a little at first, until 
thin, then pour altogether, and let boil just a minute; 
stir well, and serve immediately. Have cream whipped, 
sweetened and flavored with vanilla, is a great improve- 
ment; a dessert spoonful to each cup. 

BliACKBERRY COBDIAE. 

Make a syrup of a pound of sugar to a pint of water ; 
boil it until it is rich and thick, and then add a pint of 
blackberry juice to every pound of sugar; put half a 
grated nutmeg to each quart of syrup ; let it boil fifteen 
minutes, then add one-half pint of brandy for every 
quart of syrup. When cold, bottle for use. — Mrs. John 
Mrmn, Fayette, Mo. 

BLACKBERRY CORDIAt. 

To one quart of blackberry juice, add one pound 
white sugar, one tablespoon each of cloves, allspice, 
cinnamon and nutmeg. Boil altogether fifteen min- 
utes ; add one wine glass brandy or whiskey. Bottle 
while hot; cork and seal. — Mrs. E. Major, Fayette, Mo. 

BliACKBERRY WIXE. 

Bruise the berries, and to every gallon add one quart 
of boiling water ; let stand twenty-four hours, stirring 
it occasionally. Strain off the liquor into a cask, add- 
ing two pounds of sugar to a gallon of syrup; cork 
tight. Let stand till October, then it will be ready for 
use. — Mrs. N. C. Eubank, Fayette, Mo.

ORAP£ WIXE. 

To twenty pounds of grapes, put four quarts of boil- 
ing water; when cool, press the juice from the grape 
well, then cover over and allow them to stand about 
three days; strain the juice from the grapes, and add 
ten pounds of sugar; let stand in the jar for a week; 
then skim and strain into a cask or bottles, and seal. — 
Mrs. J. Dickerson, Fayette, Mo. 

CrRRANT WIAE. 

To two quarts of currant juice, (after the currants are 
pressed) add one quart of water and three and a half 
pounds of sugar. Let it stand in an open jar until it 
stops fermenting; then draw it off carefully. Bottle 
and cork it securely.

CURE FOR FEI.0:N. 

This remedy has never been known to fail if applied 
in time. Take a handful of Mayapple root, with water 
enough to cover ; boil until all the strength is out, then 
dip out the roots and boil down until it is thick like 
candy ; apply this candy on the affected part, and let 
it remain twelve hours, (or longer if necessary) this will 
draw it so you can easily pick it with a needle to let 
the coiruption out. When you take the Mayapple off, 
apply a poltice made of white beans, to draw out the 
poison. — Mrs. E. M. Woods, Fayette, Mo. 

REMEDY FOR WOUNDS. 

A correspondent of the Country Gejitleman, gives 
the following remedy for painful wounds. Take a pan 
or shovel with burning coals, and sprinkle on them 
common brown sugar, and hold the wounded part in 
the smoke ; in a few minutes the pain will be allayed 
and recovery rapidly proceed. 

REMEDY FOR BEE STIXGS. 

The juice of a red onion is a perfect antidote for the 
sting of bees, wasps, hornets, etc. The sting of the 
honey bee, which is always left in the wound, should 
first be removed. — Mrs. Mary Oay. 

BEE STING. 

The sting of a bee or wasp may be almost instantly 
relieved by applying lean raw meat. It is said to cure 
the bite of a rattlesnake, and to relieve erysipelas.

JLTi EXCEIil^E^T SAIiTE. 

Take a piece of wax, yellow or wliite, size of walnut; 
same of resin, and same of fresh butter (before it has 
been salted) and melt in a tin cup; set in a pot of 
water ; stir until cold. 

A SURE CURE FOR CJRAVEI.. 

Take one pound of anvil dust, pound it up fine, sift 
it through a piece of gauze, then take half as much 
horseradish, scrax)e it line; then put both in half gal- 
lon of strong vinegar; put in a stone jug. Shake well 
before using; dose teaspoonful every three or four 
hours. — George Frazier. Aug. 13, I8J4O. 

COUGH MEDICOE. 

One tumbler of good vinegar ; two tumblers of white 
sugar, twenty grains of ipecac, a lump of resin, as 
large as a lilbert. Let all come to a boil, when cool, 
add a dessert spoonful of laudanum. Dose, a teaspoon- 
ful three times a day, or oftener if the cough is trouble- 
some. — Mrs. Fratie KnicTierhoc'ker, Dec. i^, 1863. 

COUOII SYRUP. 

Take elderberries when ripe, pick off the stems and 
press the juice from them ; put on the fire and boil as 
you would for jelly ; when done, strain the juice from 
the berries, and to each pint of juice, add a pint of 
sugar. Boil down to a rich syrup ; when cool, add a 
tablespoonful of good whiskey or brandy. Dose, a 
teaspoonful every two or three hours.— J/r.9. Avne 
Shafroth. 

REMEDY FOR BURXS. 

Take best castile soap ; scrape fine with a knife ; add 
water in small quantities to make a smooth paste; 
spread upon linen; and applied to a burn quickly 
relieves the pain. Turpentine applied is also good for 
burns.

FOR SORi: THROAT. 

Cut slices of salt pork or fat bacon ; simmer a few 
moments in liot vinegar, and apply to throat as hot as 
possible. When this is taken off, as the throat is 
relieved, put around a bandage of sofc flannel. A 
gargle of equal parts of borax and alum, dissolved in 
water is also excelleuu, 

TO REMOVE DISCOIiORATIOlf FROM BRUISES. 

Apply a cloth wrung out in very hot water, and 
renew frequently until the pain ceases. 

MUSTARD PI.ASTER. 

Mix together equal parts of mustard flour with wheat 
flour, and enough water or vinegar to make a moist paste 
of them ; spread it on a piece of old muslin twice the size 
wanted, leaving about an inch clear on the edge, and. 
double the othei. half over it. It must never raise a 
blister, only leave on long enough to redden the skin. 
After it is removed, put on a rag, spread with cold 
cream or lard. 

CURE FOR CHAPPED HAXDS. 

One ounce of glycerine, one of gum camphor, one- 
half pound of mutton tallow. Make into a salve. 



To keep the hands nice and smooth, use the follow- 
ing preparation each time they are wasiied. Three 
parts of rosewater to two parts of glycerine, well mixed, 
and kept in a bottle ready for use. For those who can- 
not use glycerine, equal parts of lard and white of egg 
thoroughly beaten together, and scented according to 
choice, is an excellent remedy for chapped or rough 
hands.

BEEF TEA. 

Cut a pound of best lean steak in small pieces ; place 
in glass IVuiu Jar (a perfect one), cover tighily and set in 
a pot of cold water; heat gradually fo boil, and con- 
tinue this steadily three or four hours until the meat is 
like white rags, and the juice thoroughly extracted; 
strain from the jar as you want to use it. It is best to 
set kettle off stove and let cool, before removing the 
jar, and in this way prevent breakage. When ready 
to use, pour into a small saucer, heat, and season with 
salt and pej^per. 

MUTTOX AXD VEAL. BROTH. 

Boil a piece of mutton till it comes to pieces ; then 
strain the broth and let it get cold, so that the fat will 
rise, which must be taken off, then warm it ; and jiut in 
a little salt. Veal broth may be made in the same 
way, and is more delicate for sick persons.

Take the iirst and and second joints of a chicken; 
boil in one quart of water till very tender, and season 
with a very little salt and pepper. 

SWEET CIDER SOUP. 

Boil one pint of cider; add one teaspoonful of flour,

RTE MUSH. 

This is a nourishing and light diet for the sick, and 
is by some preferred to mush made of Indian meal. 
Four large spoonfuls of rye flour, mixed smooth in a 
1 ittle water, and stirred in a pint of boiling water ; let 
boil twenty minutes, stirring frequently. Nervous per- 
sons who sleep badly, rest much better after a supper 
of corn or rye mush, than if they take tea or coffee. 

CORX GRUEIi.' 

Mix two spoonfuls of sifted cornnieal in some water ; 
have a clean skillet with a pint of boiling water in it ; 
stir it in. and when done, season it with salt to yoar 
taste, or sugar if you prefer it. 

O ilTHEAI. GRlJEIi. 

Mix two spoonfuls of oatmeal, with as much water as 
will mix easily, and stir it in a pint of boiling water in 
a saucepan, until perfectly smooth ; let it boil a few 
minutes ; season it with sugar and nutmeg, and pour it 
out on a slice of bread, toasted, and cut up. If the 
patient should like them, you may put in a few raisins, 
stoned and cut up. This will keep good a day, and if 
nicely warmed over, is as good as when fresh. 

PAX AD A. 

Put some crackers, crusts of dry bread, or dried rusk, 
in a saucepan with cold water, and a few raisins ; after 
it has boiled half an hour, put in sugar, nutmeg, and 
half a glass of wine, if the patient has no fever. If you 
have dried rusk, it is a quicker way to put the rusk in 
a bowl with some sugar, and pour boiling water over it. 
If the patient can use nothing but liquids, this makes a 
good drink when strained. 

BOIEED CrSTARD.

sugar, add about a tablespoonful of brandy, stirring 
well as it is poured in ; tablespoonful of cream, a little 
nutmeg, and the well beaten white of the egg last. 

THICKEXED MII.K. 

Boil a pint ; dissolve one teaspoonful of cornstarch in 
a little cold milk ; add to the boiling milk, stirring con- 
stantly, until thick enough ; take from the fire ; sweeten 
and flavor with nutmeg. In boiling milk, always set 
your saucepan in which you boil the milk, in a pan of 
boiling water. 

Many of the articles under " desserts " are nice for 
the sick. In preparing food for the sick, much care 
should be taken, and it should be presented in the most 
inviting way, always the nicest china and silver used.

Ten pounds of soda ash. five pounds of unslacked 
lime, ten gallons of soft water; boil two hours; adding 
water as it boils down, so as to have as much water 
when done boiling as you had when you commenced. 
Let it stand over night. Drain off in a clean kettle ; 
then add thirty pounds of clear grease, if you have it, 
if not, and it is trimmings, add a few pounds more. 
Boil one hour ; let stand till cold. Cut out in bars, and 
let ducj before putting away. 

TO MIX WHITEWASH. 

Pour a kettle of boiling water on a peck of unslacked 
lime ; put in two pounds of whiting, and one-half pint 
salt ; when all are mixed together, put in one-half ounce 
of Prussian blue, finely powdered ; add water to make 
it a proper thickness to put on a wall. 

WHITEWASH FOR BU HIDINGS OR FEXCES. 

Put in a barrel one bushel of best unslacked lime ; 
pour on it two buckets of boiling water ; and when it is 
mixed, put in six pounds of fine whiting ; fill up the 
barrel with water : stir it well and keep it covered from 
the rain ; let it stand several days before you use it ; 
then stir it up ; thin it with milk as you use it, and put 
one-half a pint of salt to each bucketful. This makes a 
durable wash for a rcingh cast or frame house, or for 
fences ; the salt prevents it from peeling off.

ECONOMICAIi PAINT. 

Skim milk, two quarts; fresh slacked lime, eight 
ounces; linseed oil, six ounces; white burgundy pitch, 
two ounces ; Spanish white, three pounds. The lime to be 
slacked in water, exposed to the air, mixed in one-fourth 
of the milk ; the oil in which the pitch is previously 
dissolved, to be added a little at a time ; then the rest 
of the milk, and afterwards the Spanish white. This 
quantity is sufficient for twenty square yards, two coats, 
and the expense not more than twenty-live cents. 

TO STOP CRACKS IX IRON VESSEIiS. 

Mix wood ashes and salt into a paste with a little 
water ; apply whether the vessels are cold or hot. 

ce»ie:\t. 
Three parts ashes, three parts clay, and one sand, is 
said to make a cement as hard as marble, and imper- 
vious to water. 

CEMENT FOR CHINA. 
Take plaster of Paris and mix it with liquid gum 
arable into a paste. This is said to be excellent. 

TO REMOVE MII.DEW. 

Soak the parts of the cloth that are mildewed in two 
parts chloride of lime to four parts of water, for about 
four hours, or until the mildew has disappeared ; then 
thoroughly rinse it in clear water. 

CI.EANSING FMJIO. 

Four ounces of ammcmia. four ounces of white castile 
soap, two ounces of alcohol, two ounces of glycerine 
two ounces of ether. Cut the soap up fine ; dissolve in 
one quart of soft water over the ^re ; then add four 
quarts of cold water. When nearly cold add tne other 
ingredients. This will make almost eight quarts.

HAIR WASH. 

Take su^ar of lead, lac sulphur, of each one and a half 
drachms or teaspoonfuls ; bay rum, one-fourth pint; 
glycerine, two ounces. 

HAIR WASH "ErREKA." 

One ounce of borax, one ounce lac sulphur, one 
ounce of sugar lead, two ounces of bay rum, three pints 
of rain water. 

WASHING COMPOIJXD. 

One-half pound of super- carbonate soda, one-half 
pound unslacked lime, one gallon boiling water; boil 
twenty minutes. Pour off the top after letting it stand 
to settle ; then bottle. Sort your clothes, soap them, 
and then soak over night. In the morning wring out ; 
soap, if more is needed, and put a teaspoonful of the 
fluid to a boiler of clothes; boil one-half hour. They 
will need but little rubbing. This does not injure the 
clothes. 

POWDER FOR SCENT BAGS. 

One ounce each of coriander seed, orris root, rose 
leaves, lavender flowers, and sweet calamus; one 
drachm of mace and allspice. Mix and put in your 
bags, or between the covers of your handkerchief-box 
lid. 

TO PREVEBfT RUSTIXG. 

To prevent metals from rusting, melt together three 
parts lard and one of resin, and apply a very thin coat- 
ing. It will preserve Russia-iron stoves and grates 
from rusting during summer, even in damp situations. 
The eff'ect is equally good in brass, copper, steel, etc. 

TO POMSH TIXWARE. 

First rub the tin with a damp cloth; then take dry 
flour and rub it on with your hand ; take an old news- 
paper and rub the flour off", and the tin will shine as 



MISCELLANEOUS. 149 

well as if half an hour had been spent in rubbing with 
brick dust or powders. 

TO RESTORE FURNITURE. 

Make a mixture of three parts of linseed oil, and one 
part spirits of turpentine ; put it on with a woolen cloth, 
and when dry, rub with a woolen cloth or chamois. 
Good for cleaning picture frames and restoring furniture 
marred or scratched. It covers the disfigured surface, 
and restores wood to its original color, leaving a lustre 
upon the surface. 

SCOIIRISTG L.IQIJID FOR BRASS. 

Oil of vitriol, one ounce; sweet oil, one-half gill; 
pulverized rotten stone, one gill; rain water, one and 
a half pints. Mix well and shake as used. Apply with 
a rag, and then polish with buckskin or old woolen. 

SPOTS OIV VARXISHED FURXITURE 

Are readily removed b}^ rubbing them with essence of 
peppermint, or spirits of camphor, and afterwards with 
furniture polish or oil. 

TO CI.EAX SILTER. 

Wash silver in very hot, clear water, wipe dry with a 
soft towel, and you will have no need for any prepara- 
tion. 

TO REMOVE A OI^ASS STOPPER 

From a bottle, hold a lighted match to the neck of the 
bottle, and the heat will cause the neck so to expand 
that the stopper will loosen. 

FOR TAKING OCT GREASE SPOTS. 

Gasoline is splendid for cleaning grease out of any- 
thing, from a piece of point lace to a carpet. Wash 
lace or silk handkerchiefs in it; rub larger things with 
a sponge ; but it is explosive, and so must be kept far 
from the fire. 



150 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 

TO EXTRACT INK. 

To extract ink from cotton, silk and woolen goods, 
saturate the spot witli spirits of turpentine, and let it 
remain several hours ; then rub it between the hands. 
It will crumble away without injuring either the color 
or texture of the article. 

TO TAKE INK OUT OF lilXEN 

Dip the spotted part in pure tallow, melted ; then wash 
out the tallow and the ink will disappear. 

TO REMOVE TAR. 

Rnb well with clean lard, afterwards wash with soap 

and warm water. Apply this to either hands or 

clothing. 

STOVE POI.ISH. 

Stove lustre, when mixed with turpentine and ap- 
plied in the usual manner, is blacker, more glossy, and 
more durable than when mixed with any other liquid. 
The turpentine prevents rust, and when put on an old, 
rusty stove will make it look as well as new. 

TO WASH OIL-CIiOTH. 

Oil-cloth ma}^ be made to have a fresh, new appear- 
ance, by washing it every month with a solution of 
sweet milk, with the white of one beaten egg. Soap, in 
time, injures oil-cloth. A very little "boiled oil," 
freshens up an oil-cloth. Very little must be used, and 
rubbed in with a rag. Equal parts of copal varnish, I 
put; it gives a gloss. 

SWEETENING STONE JARS. 

"Having some stone jars in which lard had been 
placed until they became unfit for use, I made perfectly 
sweet by packing them full of fresh earth, and letting it 
remain two or three weeks. I suspect this course would 
be equally effective in any case of foul earthen or stone- 
ware."

RANCID BUTTER 

May be remedied by patting in a saucepan and scald- 
ing; ilien put in a piece of toasted bread which will 
absorb all the bad part of the batter ; pour oif carefally 
into a clean dish, from the dark sediment which will 
be found in the bottom of the saucepan. 

A IJSEFIJI. DRUO. 

Ammonia, or as it is generally called spirits of harts- 
horn, is a powerful alkali, and dissolves grease and 
dirt 'with great ease. For washing paint, put a tea- 
spoonful in a quart of moderately hot water ; dip in a 
flannel cloth and then wipe off the woodwork; no 
scrubbing will be necessary. For taking grease spots 
from an}^ fabric, use the ammonia nearly pure; then 
lay white blotting paper over the spot; then iron it 
lightly. In washing lace, put about twelve drops in a 
phit of warm suds. To clean silver, mix two teaspoon- 
fuls of ammonia in a quart of hot suds. Put in your 
silverware and wash; using an old nail brush or tooth 
brush for the pui-pose. For cleaning hair brushes, etc., 
simply shake the brushes up and down in a mixture of 
a tablespoonful of ammonia to one pint of hot water ; 
when they are cleansed, rinse them in cold water and 
stand them in the wind or in a hot place to dry ; and 
for taking out the red stains produced by the strong 
acids in blue and black cloths, there is nothing better 
than ammonia. 

TO CI.EAN HAIR BRUSHES. 

Do not use soap, but put a tablespoon of hartshorn 
into the water, having it only tepid, and dip up and 
down until clean; then dry with the brushes down, and 
they will be like new ones. If you do not have ammo- 
nia, use soda ; a teaspoon ful dissolved in the water will 
do very well. 



152 THE MISSOURI COOK BOOK. 

Nails dipped in soap, will drive easily in hard wood. 

Mica windows in stoves, when smoked, are readily 
cleaned by taking out and thoroughly washing with 
vinegar, a little diluted. If the black does not come off 
at once, let it soak a little. 



White clothes may be whitened in washing, by boil- 
ing a teaspoonful of turpentine with them. 

A little borax put in the water in which scarlet 
napkins and red bordered towels are to be washed, will 
prevent them from fading. 

A small quantity of diluted vitriol will take stains 
out of marble. Wet the spots with the acid, and in a 
few minutes rub briskly with a soft linen cloth till they 
disappear.
