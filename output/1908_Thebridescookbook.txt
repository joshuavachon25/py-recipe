INTRODUCTORY 

She who would be mistress of her own home must 
know how to cook as well as manage. This holds true 
whether or not one has servants. In either case, there is 
independence, happiness and contentment for those who 
know what to do and how to do it — and worry, disap- 
pointment, and oft-times despair for those who do not. 

The Bride's Cook Book is born of my own twenty 
years experience in housekeeping and I fondly dedicate 
it to young wives the world over, in the hope that their 
cares will be lightened and their homes brightened by its 
counsel. 

Notwithstanding the fact that the publishers have 
made it into a wondrously dainty volume, its contents 
will be found entirely practical. When I learned to 
cook as a girl bride in my own home, I found my pathway 
rough indeed from sheer lack of knowing the first rudi- 
ments of cooking, so, in preparing this book, I adopted 
the plan that the best way to give over my own experience 
to young house-keepers was to be perfectly plain in my 
statements. 

That the recipes might be economical as well as prac- 
tical, I have put in them the exact proportion of each 
article required to serve two or three persons. When it 
is necessary to serve more, the proper proportion can be 
easily added. In some of the recipes, where the result 



would not be satisfactory if the "two or three" quantity 
were strictly adhered to, I have given larger proportions, 
and these recipes will prove advantageous when enter- 
taining. 

It is suggested that when there is any doubt as to what 
quantity is designated or what time is required for cook- 
ing, the "weights and measures" and "the time table for 
cooking" be consulted. 

I believe The Bride's Cook Book contains everything 
necessary for the proper instruction of the 3^oung mistress 
of the household. Good wishes to her. L. D.

BREAKFASTS 

Vary the menu but do not crowd the breakfast table 
with too many dishes and thus rob the appetite of its 
chance to be tempted at this most delightful meal of the 
day. The morning meal should be dainty, appetizing 
and prettily served, with just enough variety to make 
one feel the joy of living.

LUNCHEONS 

Even if one should be alone, this meal should not be 
made doubly dismal by lack of preparation. One should 
not encourage the habit of eating from the ice-chest or 
pantry. Spread the cloth and make the table attractive 
no matter how little is to be served. This is good for 
one's energy and keeps one from becoming slack in 
method.

DINNERS 

Whatever may be done for the cheerfulness of other 
meals of the day, dinner should come in for one's best 
thought. The wear and tear of the day for both hus- 
band and wife should terminate at the dinner hour, when 
the magic touch, dainty service, and good cooking, 
coupled with good humor and tact, will surely tend to 
bring the day's work in the household to a successful close.

SUNDAY NIGHT LUNCHEONS 

The question of what to serve for the Sunday night 
meal depends largely upon the time and character of the 
regular Sunday dinner. To tempt the appetite it is pref- 
erable to arrange a menu entirely different from the pre- 
ceding dinner, although it is a very common practice to 
utilize cold roast meat or fowl that may be left over from 
that meal. There are many simple combinations, how- 
ever, that are easy of preparation and are more likely to 
please the palates of those to be served.

FIVE O'CLOCK TEAS 

The Five O'clock Tea is, at least in an informal way, 
a delightful, easy and delicate means of entertainment 
and continues to grow in popular esteem. Menus for this 
service are more effective when simple and served without 
ceremony. It is entirely proper to utilize ordinary utensils 
and dishes, but the pretty custom is largely aided by 
special china of some distinctive and delicate pattern.

THE CHAFING DISH 

While entirely practical for use in preparing any menu 
of the day, the chafing dish, from the standpoint of the 
private family circle, has its greatest utility in the giving 
of late suppers. To those who will take the trouble to 
learn what may be done with a chafing dish will come 
the knowledge that nearly the whole range of cookery 
is within its compass. The menus under this head, al- 
though limited in number, will give sufficient experience 
to warrant the use of practically all of the entree and egg 
recipes to be found elsewhere.

To 4 pounds of lean beef put 4 quarts of cold water. 
Let it come to a boil. Skim well and boil gently from 6 
to 8 hours. Add pepper and salt; strain and cool. Re- 
move all grease. It is then ready for any kind of soup. 

Asparagus Soup. 

Boil until tender, 1 quart of asparagus, cut in inch 
lengths, in 1 quart of water. Rub through a colander 
and return to the water in which it was boiled. Heat 1 
pint of milk, stir into it, 1 table-spoonful of butter, with 
1 tablespoonful of flour and cook a few moments. Sea- 
son, and pour into asparagus. Let all boil up well, and 
pour into a tureen or plates or over toasted bread, cut 
into dice. Serve at once. 

Bean Soup. 

Soak 1 quart of beans over night and in the morning 
pour off the water and put on a quart of fresh water. 
Let boil 10 or 15 minutes and drain; then pour on 2 
quarts of cold water, and add a small piece of bacon or 
side pork. When the beans begin to get tender, remove 
enough for a nice dish of baked beans. Mash the rest 
of the beans, and season with salt and pepper. Add 1 
table-spoonful of flour and butter rubbed smooth. Put 
through a colander and pour into a tureen over toast cut 
into dice. 

35 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Beef Bouillon. 
Boil 13^4 pounds of beef cut in pieces in 1 quart

and season with pepper and salt. 

Chicken Bouillon. 

(For T^welve Persons.) 

Scrub and clean a 3 pound chicken thoroughly; cut

then season to taste with salt and pepper and skim 
through a cheese-cloth.

spoonful of flour; let thicken and serve at once. 

Cream of Corn.

To 1 pint of corn add 1 quart of hot water; boil for l 
hour or longer, then press through a colander, put into 
the saucepan butter the size of a small egg and when it 
bubbles sprinkle in a heaping table-spoonful of sifted 
flour; cook 1 minute stirring it well. Add the corn pulp 
a little at a time so as not to lump; l pint of boiling 
water; cayenne pepper, salt and 1 cup full of cream. 
Just before serving add the yolks of 2 eggs, mixed with 
a little milk or cream. Do not let it boil after the eggs 
have been added. 

Cream Pea Soup. 

Cover a pint of green peas with water and boil with 
a very small onion until they mash easily. Mash and 
add 1 pint of water. Cook 1 table-spoonful of butter 
and 3^ table-spoonful of flour until smooth, but not 
brown. Add the flour and butter to the peas with yi.

once; strain and serve. 

37 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK

mon and mash fine. Heat a quart of milk in a double 
boiler, thicken with 2 even table-spoonfuls of butter 
which have been rubbed smoothly into 4 even table- 
spoonfuls of flour. When smooth add sauce gradually 
to salmon, let come to a boil and season with salt and 
pepper, just before serving. 

Lobster Bisque. 
(For Five.) 
Chop 1 can of lobster rather coarse, taking care not 
to tear it. Put 3 pints of boiling water, salt, pepper, 
and lobster into a saucepan and cook gently for 20 min- 
utes. Have ready 2 cups of scalding milk in which Yz

tea-spoonful of unground peppers, 6 unground allspice, 
6 unground cloves, 1 sliced onion, 1 carrot cut in dice, 
1 table-spoonful of salt; cover well with water and cook 
until tender, simmering rather than boiling and skim- 
ming thoroughly at the first. Cover the stock and boil

38 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

2 table-Spoonfuls of flour, stir constantly until the flour 
is browned. Pour 2 cups of stock over the butter and 
flour and stir until smooth; add to the head stock. Have 
stewed i cup of tomatoes; add this to the head stock with 
a cup full of the meat cut in dice; the juice of l lemon 
and a table-spoonful of Worcestershire Sauce. Add more 
salt and pepper if necessary. Simmer for 15 minutes. 

Mulligatawny Soup.

butter until brown. When the chicken has started to 
brown, add two sliced onions, 1 carrot cut in cubes and 3 
pieces of chopped celery; sprinkle the vegetables and 
chicken with a heaping table-spoonful of flour ; let brown ; 
add 3 unground cloves, a sprig of parsley, a blade of 
mace, 4 unground peppers, 1 tea-spoonful curry powder, 1 
cup of stewed tomatoes, and 5 cups of stock, and simmer 
for an hour. Take out the chicken and cut into small 
pieces; strain the soup; force the vegetables through a 
sieve; add the juice of a lemon; put all together; season 
with salt and pepper, re-heat; serve with boiled rice. If 
you have no stock, water may be used instead and a table-

FISH 

Fresh fish are always firm, the fins stiff, the scales 
bright, the eyes full, and the gills red. In large fish, 
like halibut, the flesh should be close-grained, firm and 
bright. Fish should be thoroughly washed and cleaned 
and kept in a cool place until ready for use. There are 
many fish, such as cat fish, white fish, trout, bass, also 
cod steak and halibut which are more toothsome fried or 
broiled than any other way. Putting a strip of bacon 
in the pan when frying fish gives a pleasant flavor. 
Fried fish should be turned several times and thoroughly 
cooked until of a light brown color. When serving 
garnish with parsley, and allow a slice of lemon for each 
person. 

"To Bake Fish. 

If possible have an iron sheet which will fit into your 
baking pan for fish. Prop up broad and short fish with 
stale bread, and make long, slender fish into the letter 
*'S" by running a stout string through the head, center 
of body and tail. A piece of cloth can be used in place 
of the iron sheet to lift the cooked fish from the pan to 
the platter. A few slices of fat pork or bacon laid over 
the fish will add to the flavor. Baste often and bake in a 
moderately hot oven until of a dark brown color. 

^o Fry Fish. 
Fish to be fried should be washed, wiped, salted and 

45 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

peppered, rolled in flour and fried over a moderately 
hot fire to a light brown color.

1^0 Broil Fish. 
Small fish can be broiled whole by cutting off the 
head and tail and splitting down the back. Large fish 
should be cut into inch strips. All fish should be 
thoroughly cleaned and dried with a towel; oily fish 
need only salt and pepper but dry fish should be spread 
with butter. The broiler should be well greased and 
the fish allowed to broil from 9 to 20 minutes according 
to the thickness. Thin fish can be placed nearer the fire 
and broiled more rapidly than thick fish. Remove from 
the broiler to the platter without breaking; spread again 
with butter; serve with tartar, tomato or curry sauce; 
garnish with slices of lemon. 

Fish Stuffing. 
One quart of grated bread or cracker crumbs; 1-3 of a

ley, capers, and sour cucumber pickles, salt and pepper

MEATS 

Beef.

if it is elastic and bright the meat is good and fresh.

slowly for 3/2 hour. Then season with salt and pepper. 
Do not add more water; let cook very slowly until the 
meat is tender. Remove and drain off the liquor into 
a bowl, skimming off the grease which rises to the top. 
Dredge the roast with flour and return to the pot with 
a large lump of butter and a bit of sliced onion. Set 
on the stove to brown, turning frequently lest it burns or 
sticks. When thoroughly browned, add the liquor which

Po/ Roast No. 2. 

Select beef as for Pot Roast No. i . Put in a hot fry- 
ing pan and turn continually until the roast is of a rich 
brown color. Put in a pot with Yi pint of water over a 
very slow fire. Add a little water from time to time, 
just enough to keep the roast from burning. Be sure 
the cover fits tightly enough to keep in the steam as this 
is what cooks the roast. Cook until very tender. Make 
a gravy by adding brown flour and water. The roast 
is very good served cold. 

Fillet of Beef Larded. 

The Fillet is the tenderloin of beef and any good 
butcher will lard and trim it very tastefully. Salt and 
pepper and put in a dripping pan without water. Put 
in the oven for 30 minutes and then in the broiler for 10 
minutes longer; serve on platter garnished with parsley. 
Serve with the fillet a mushroom sauce. 

Beef Fie, 

Another good way of utilizing bits of cold steak, pot 
roast or even roast is by means of the beef pie. Line 
a baking dish with a rich biscuit dough. Put in a layer 
of bits of cold meat, chopped cold boiled potatoes, a bit 
of onion chopped fine, a little chopped parsley; then an- 
other layer of the meat, and so on, until the meat is ex- 
hausted or the dish nearly filled. Pour over all cold 
gravy; cover with a crust which has a slit cut in it; 

70 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

brush crust with beaten egg and bake until crust is done. 
A meat pie may be made in the same manner with any 
kind of cold meat from which has been removed all 
gristle and superfluous fat. 

Beef au Gratin. 

Butter a baking dish and put in the bottom a few 
bits of cold ham ; add a little chopped onion ; cover with 
bread crumbs, lay in pieces of cold beef, cover with bread 
crumbs, moisten with stock and bake 20 or 30 minutes 
in a moderate oven. 

Ragout of Beef. 

Chop cold roast or boiled beef; add a few cold potatoes 
cut in cubes, a chopped onion, sufficient water to make 
a gravy and a bit of chopped parsley. 

Beef Hash 

Put through meat chopper, pieces of cold steak or 
roast beef; add 1 chopped onion. Put into a skillet with 
cold gravy, or if there is none on hand, a piece of butter. 
Only warm; do not cook. 

Beef Hash. 

Chop either cold steak or roast with cold boiled pota- 
toes and 2 small onions. Put over the fire; add a piece 
of butter, salt and pepper, cold gravy or hot water; cook 
until brown. 

71 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Hash Southern Style. 

Chop meat and potatoes, allowing i part of meat to 
2 parts of potatoes ; season with salt and pepper and add 
1 or 2 chopped onions. Put a little hot water or beef 
stock in the bottom of the spider; add a table-spoonful of 
butter and the hash. Simmer slowly until the water is 
absorbed and a soft brown crust has formed. Chopped 
green or red pepper may be added instead of the onion. 
Do not let it get too dry and do not stir too much. 

Beef Kidney. 

Have beef kidneys cut in thin slices ; salt and pepper 
and fry in hot fat to a light brown color. Then add a 
little water; thicken with Yi tablespoonful of flour; add 
a little chopped parsley and serve hot. 

Beef 'Tongue. 

Fresh beef tongue should be well washed and put on 
to boil in just enough water to cover, with a handful of 
salt and plenty of red pepper. Replenish the water as 
it boils away and cook until the tongue can be easily 
picked with a fork. Do not remove the skin until the 
tongue is to be used. When salt tongue is used, soak 
over night. 

Corned Beef. 

Select a nice piece of corned beef and if too salt soak 
in cold water Yi hour before cooking. Boil slowly, 
changing the water several times. Cook until tender. 

72 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Cabbage or spinach may be cooked with the corned beef 
and served with it while hot if desired. If the beef is 
to be eaten cold, put in a pan under a weight until cold. 
Cut in thin slices. 

Corned Beef Hash. 

Corned beef hash makes an ideal breakfast dish and is 
prepared the same as Beef Hash, allowing i part of meat 
to 2 parts of potatoes; chop together rather fine; add 
enough hot water to keep from sticking; season with 
pepper (salt will probably not be necessary) ; mold in a 
round dish and when done put poached egg on top and 
serve with dry toast. 

Chipped Beef Stewed. 

Tear dried beef into small pieces and make a cream 
dressing of equal parts of milk and water and a little 
flour to thicken and one well beaten egg. Let cook until 
it thickens and serve hot. If the beef is too salty it 
should be boiled a little and the water poured off before 
adding the milk and water for the dressing. 

Lamb and Mutton. 

Good mutton is fine of grain, red and juicy; the fat 
solid and white. Until a year old, sheep are known as 
"lambs", and until six months old as "spring lambs." 
The lean should be pink and white. Both lamb and 
mutton spoil very easily, and should therefore be bought 

73 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

only in small quantities for immediate use. Lamb and 
mutton should always be served on hot dishes. 

Broiled Lamb Chops. 

Order your lamb chops according to the number you 
wish rather than by the pound — they will average three 
or four to a pound. Salt and pepper and place on the 
broiler under a moderate fire until well browned. Garnish 
with parsley. 

Mutton Chops. 

Season the mutton chops with salt and pepper; cook 
over a moderate fire for 45 minutes. Make a sauce of 
a can of tomatoes, a few cloves, an onion sliced, a table- 
spoonul of butter rubbed smooth with a table-spoonful 
of flour; cook 10 minutes; strain and pour over the chops. 
Serve hot. 

Roast Lamb. 

Select a leg of lamb the desired size. Remove the 
caul; wash and wipe; season with salt and pepper; 
dredge with flour. Put in a moderately hot oven and

The leg may be boned and stuffed if desired. Serve 
with mint sauce or current jelly. 

Crown Roast. 

Have your butcher prepare Crown Roast, allowing 
two ribs to each person and two or three extra. Put in

comes out of the oven. Fill the top of the roast with 
peas which have been cooked in water with butter, salt 
and pepper added. Garnish with latticed potatoes. 

Lamb Kidneys, 

Soak kidneys for an hour; pare and slice; season with 
salt and pepper; fry in hot butter for 5 or 8 minutes; 
remove from the fire and dredge with flour; return to 
the fire and add a cup of boiling water or broth; cook 10 
minutes longer; season with onion or lemon juice. Serve 
immediately and very hot or the kidneys will be tough. 
This dish cannot easily be warmed over or kept waiting 
as the kidneys toughen very quickly. 

Pork. 

Pork is the flesh of hogs and pigs and 'tis said the 
packer now utilizes every part of that "dainty bird" but 
the squeal. The parts most likely to be used by the 
young housewife are bacon, ham, chops, roast pork, saus- 
age, and perhaps pickled pigs' feet. 

Broiled Breakfast Bacon. 

Slice lean strips of bacon and put in a small dripping 
pan on the broiler under a slow blaze, or put in the oven 
and cook as the French broil. It is then delicately done 
and not liable to burn. 

75 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Bacon and Liver. 

Always be sure to select calves' liver. Boiling water 
should be poured over the liver which will cause a thin 
skin to form and which should be removed by scraping 
with a sharp knife. Dredge with flour and season with 
salt and pepper. Cut your bacon as thin as possible and 
place in the skillet with the liver. Fry slowly until well 
done. 

Fried Ham with Eggs. 

If the ham is very salt it should be first parboiled be- 
fore frying. Turn often and fry until brown. Remove 
to a hot platter ; have your eggs ready and fry as quickly 
as possible in the ham fat, dipping the grease over the 
tops of the eggs until the "eyes are shut." 

Broiled Ham. 

Ham for broiling should be cut thin. If very salt, 
parboil first. Dry and place on broiler under a moder- 
ate fire for lO minutes. Garnish with parsley. 

Roast Ham with Champagne. 

Place a baked ham in the oven lO or 15 minutes to 
warm before serving; place on a platter and pour over 
it, 1 pint of champagne. Garnish with parsley and send 
at once to the table. 

Boiled Ham. 
Wash and put in kettle with plenty of water and let 

76 



THE BRIDE^S COOK BOOK 

boil slowly until tender. Remove and peal off the rind; 
dredge with flour and a sprinkling of sugar ; add a little 
cinnamon and stick a few cloves in the ham. Place the 
ham in a dripping pan with a little water and continue 
the cooking until the ham is browned and well done. 
Serve hot, or cut in thin slices when cold. 

Broiled Figs' Feet. 
Wash and wipe the pigs' feet; season with salt and 
pepper; place on a broiler and broil for lO or 15 minutes. 
When well done place on a platter and pour over them 
melted butter.

Wash and wipe the pigs' feet; season with salt and 
pepper; dip in beaten egg; roll in cracker crumbs; fry in 
deep fat until well done.

pepper; broil until thoroughly done, spread with butter; 
serve while hot on a hot platter. 

Fork Chops. 
Season the chops with salt and pepper; dip in beaten 
egg; roll in cracker crumbs; fry, turning several times 
until brown. Put a little water in the skillet and allow 
to simmer for several minutes to be sure the chops are 
well done. Garnish and serve with apple sauce. If gravy 

77 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

is desired, pour off part of the grease ; put a table-spoon- 
ful of flour in the skillet and rub with the grease until 
smooth and brown. Add hot water to make the required 
consistency. 

Roast Pork. 

Roast same as beef, dredging the pork with flour; 
baste often. Make a gravy from the juices, pouring off 
part of the grease if the roast is very fat. Serve with 
apple sauce and sweet potatoes. 

Baked Pork and Beans. 

Soak 1 quart or less of beans over night, and in the 
morning drain and put over the fire with plenty of water 
and 1 large table-spoonful of soda; let come to a boil and 
drain again. Add more water and salt, and cook until 
the beans begin to get tender; put in a crock or bean jar 
with a small onion in the middle and well to the bottom. 
Add Yi pound of salt pork, 3 table-spoonfuls of molasses, 
a little more water, 1 tea-spoonful of mustard, and a little 
salt well mixed together. Watch and see that they do 
not burn or get dry; they may need more water during 
the baking. 

Sausage. 

Sausage comes either in links or bulk. When in links, 
separate and pierce with a fork; parboil; drain and fry 
same as bacon. Link sausages may also be boiled and 
served with horseradish. When bought in bulk a pound

THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

at a time is sufficient and should be made into small flat 
cakes and fried. This is a nice dish for breakfast. 

Scrapple. 
Scrapple is prepared by many butchers but owing to 
the slight demand is often hard to get. Get the head, 
heart and lean scraps from the butcher; cook until the 
meat falls from the bones; remove the fat and gristle 
and put the meat throught a meat chopper. Set the 
liquor in which the meat was cooked aside to cool ; skim 
off the fat which comes to the top ; return to the fire and 
when it reaches the boiling point, add the chopped meat ; 
season with salt and pepper; thicken with corn meal, 
taking care to keep all the lumps out. Allow to cook 
gently for i hour. Pour into greased pans, when cold 
slice and fry as you would corn meal mush. 

Veal. 

Veal is the young of beef. It is killed, say from a 
month and a half to two months old. Like lamb it is 
eaten soon after killing. The flesh should be of a pink- 
ish color and the fat white. Like lamb it should be 
thoroughly cooked. Veal can be had through the entire 
year but is best in the spring. When cooking, if a slice 
of bacon is added, the flavor is greatly improved. 

Veal Cutlets. 
The cutlets are taken from the leg of the veal and 
should be cut Yi inch in thickness. Pound and season

soft and easily bent. A chicken must be young for broil- 
ing, but for boiling, fricassee, or stewing, fowl a year old 
is more economical. Fowl should be drawn as soon as 
possible after killing. Remove the pin feathers and singe 
the hairs by holding over a gas burner or a roll of burn- 
ing paper. Careless cooks do not always remove the oil 
bag in the tail, the kidneys in the back and the lungs in 
the ribs. 

Stuffing for Foultry and Game. 

For a chicken, take as much bread or cracker crumbs 
as will fill the chicken; a turkey takes nearly twice as 
much as a chicken ; season highly with salt, pepper, thyme 
and sage (onion may be used in place of the sage) ; mois- 
ten with Yt, cup of melted butter and sufficient hot water 
to make quite moist. Add i beaten egg. Oysters, chest- 
nuts, chopped celery, dates, raisins, or chopped onions 
may be added for a change. Always rub the inside of the

your roasting pan after your fowl is done, pour off the 

84 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK

THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

add the fried onions; season well with salt and paprika 
pepper; cover well with boiling water and cook slowly 
until tender. In the meantime, have cooking in a double 
boiler, a cup full of rice. When the chicken is very nearly 
done, add the rice and a can of tomatoes, or five ripe to- 
matoes which have stewed for 10 minutes. Stew all to- 
gether slowly for 10 minutes more, stirring often to pre-

VEGETABLES 

See that all vegetables are in good condition ; cull out 
all decayed ones as these will cause the others to decay; 
keep in a cool, dry place. Those that can be scrubbed 
with a small brush, kept for that purpose, should be so 
treated. When vegetables snap crisply, they are fresh. 
They are greatly improved by standing in cold water be- 
fore using. No time can be given, as it depends upon the 
age and condition of the vegetables, but all vegetables 
should be cooked until soft and tender and can be tested 
by pricking with a fork. Green vegetables should be 
cooked uncovered and will then keep their color. 

When frying potatoes (or anything, for that matter) 
in deep fat, it is better to drain oif some of the grease by 
placing them on clean brown or white paper for a few 
moments after removing them from the stove, before put- 
ting them into the heated dish in which they are to be 
served.

SALADS 

Salads made of green vegetables should be served as 
fresh and crisp and cold as possible. This may be accom- 
plished by allowing the vegetables to stand for one-half 
hour in ice cold water; then wrap in a towel and place in 
the refrigerator until as short a time as possible before 
serving. If before serving, the vegetables are dried, the 
oil will cling. For this reason, oil should be used before 
vinegar if the two are used at the table without being 
mixed into a dressing. The salad dressing should be 
added at the table as green vegetables wilt soon after 
dressing is placed on them. Cold cooked vegetables, such 
as string beans, beets, asparagus, potatoes, cauliflower, 
etc., are very good served with salad dressing. The Plain 
French Dressing does very well for this. Unlike green 
vegetable salads, these salads are better if prepared and 
put in the refrigerator an hour before serving. 

Meat salads, made with any kind of cold cooked fish, 
lobster, oysters, eggs, chicken, etc., combined with fresh 
green vegetables are delicious. The meat should be pre- 
pared with the dressing and allowed to stand in the re- 
frigerator an hour before mixing with the green vege- 
tables. 

Boiled Dressing. 

Mix thoroughly i tea-spoonful of mustard, 2 tea- 
spoonfuls of salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper and 2 table- 
spoonfuls of sugar; rub into these ingredients 2 table- 

123 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

spoonfuls of melted butter; add i cup of cream and the 
whites of 3 eggs, beaten stiff. Pour in slowly, stirring 
constantly, j/2 cup of hot vinegar. Put in a double boiler 
and cook until thick. This is a recipe for a comparatively 
large quantity, but it is given in full, as the dressing will 
keep for two or three weeks if kept in a cool place. How- 
ever, it may be cut in half if desired for only one service. 

Cream Dressing. 

Yolks of 5 eggs, 5 table-spoons of vinegar, 5 table- 
spoons of melted butter, 1 tea-spoonful of salt, j/2 tea- 
spoonful of mustard, 1 Yz tea-spoonfuls of sugar, a pinch 
of cayenne pepper. Put eggs in double boiler and beat 
very light. Have vinegar hot, to boiling point, and pour 
into the eggs, stirring all the time. Then add melted but- 
ter and sugar, salt, mustard, and pepper and cook until 
the consistency of whipped cream. For 1 table-spoon of 
the mixture add 3 table-spoons of the whipped cream and 
mix thoroughly. This mixture should be put in jelly 
glasses and kept in ice-box. It will serve four or five 
times. 

French Dressing. 

Mix thoroughly 3^4 tea-spoonful of salt, Y^ tea-spoon- 
ful of pepper and 2 table-spoonfuls of vinegar; add 4 
table-spoonfuls of olive oil, a few drops at a time. 9 
drops of onion juice may be added if desired, or, if only a 
very little of the flavor is desired, the salad dish may be 
rubbed with a slice of onion or a piece of garlic. 

124 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Mayoiinaise Dressing. 

Beat well with a silver fork on a large flat plate the 
yolks of 2 fresh eggs. Add i level tea-spoonful each of 
dry mustard and salt well mixed together. To this add 
a tea-cupful or more of oil, beginning with a few drops at 
a time, mixing well, and adding the remainder gradu- 
ally, together with the juice of one lemon. If the mix- 
ture separates the oil is being added too rapidly. In 
that case add a few drops of lemon juice and stir well, 
before putting in more oil. All of the ingredients 
should be cold when used. (It takes from half an hour 
to one hour to make the dressing, as it must be thoroughly 
stirred during all the mixing.) When the dressing is 
finished place in a china bowl and cover tightly until 
ready for use. If the weather is warm the dressing 
should be put on ice. 

Mayonnaise T^artare. 

Chop olives, sour pickles and onion and add to the 
Mayonnaise dressing. Use pearl onions instead of the 
chopped onions if they are to be had. 

Spanish Dressing. 

Mix thoroughly Yi tea-spoonful of powdered sugar, 
j/2 tea-spoonful of paprika pepper and ]/i tea-spoonful 
of salt; add one table-spoonful of German mustard; add 
alternately, a little at a time, 2 table-spoonfuls of vine- 
gar and 7 table-spoonfuls of olive oil. This salad dress-

tea-spoonful of mustard, a generous pinch of salt, and a 
sprinkling of pepper. Put over to boil. Cream 2 table- 
spoonfuls of butter with i tea-spoonful of flour ; add to 
the boiling vinegar, stirring constantly to prevent lump- 
ing; cook five minutes, and as soon as taken from the fire, 
add 1 egg, well beaten. Mix the dressing while hot with 
the cabbage. Serve cold. 

Stuffed California Cherries. 
Seed as many large California cherries as you wish to 
serve; stuff with English walnut or pecan meats, finely

in pieces about one-quarter of an inch long. Mix thor- 
oughly and sprinkle with salt and a few drops of lemon 
juice. Then place on ice.

place on top of each portion a tea-spoonful of the May- 
onnaise Dressing and garnish with lemon, cold hard 
boiled eggs, cut in thin slices, capers, or pitted olives cut 
in halves. Sweet Spanish peppers may also be used as 
a garnish with good effect. 

Note. Cold boiled turkey (white meat only) makes 
a fine salad.

Line the salad dish with leaves of crisp, fresh head 
lettuce; stand around the side of the bowl, slices of 
tomatoes; fill the centre of the dish half full of sliced 
cucumbers and sliced radishes; chop fine i full stalk of 
fresh celery, discarding all pieces which are not tender.

DESSERTS 

PIES AND PASTRY 

Plain Pie Crust. 

Use pastry flour and have the shortening thoroughly 
chilled. For one pie, use i cup of flour, a pinch of salt 
and 1-3 cup of shortening. Add enough ice water to 
make the paste. Toss on a floured board ; press together ; 
roll out, lightly, with the rolling-pin, being careful not 
to bear down and to always handle the paste as lightly 
as possible. Spread with lard; make a roll of the paste; 
cut off 1-3 of the roll for the upper crust; roll out the 
larger piece for the bottom crust. Spread the top crust 
with lard. Bake in a hot oven. When but one crust 
is used, a strip of the paste should be fluted around the 
edge, making the crust deeper. 

The quicker puff paste is made the lighter it will be. 

A brisk oven is needed for all pastry. A very simple 
test will show the right heat. Insert a piece of white 
note paper into the oven and after five (5) minutes take 
it out. A pale yellow hue on the paper will indicate 
that it is too slow for ordinary puff paste ; a nice brown 
color, decided in tone, shows that the heat is just right. 
A very dark brown shows too much heat.

Flaky Fie Crust. 

Put 1 cup of flour on the breadboard; add a pinch of 
salt, 3 table-spoonfuls of ice cold butter, chopped 
through the floor; add 3 table-spoonfuls of ice water; 
toss together; roll lightly; bake in a very quick oven. 

Mrs. E. C. Hoag. 

Pie Crust For Dyspeptics. 

To 1 cup of flour, add 1 heaping tea-spoonful of bak- 
ing powder and Yi tea-spoonful of salt; sift together; 
work in lightly 2 table-spoonfuls of shortening, prefer- 
ably cooking oil, though fresh butter or melted suet may 
be used, but not lard. Add sufficient water to render 
the paste soft enough to be easily handled. If fresh 
butter is not to be had for the shortening it may be 
washed as following: Scald a wooden bowl, and let 
stand for a few minutes filled with cold water; wash the 
hands in hot water and then in cold. Place the butter 
to be washed in the bowl under a faucet of running cold 
water; squeeze the butter through the fingers until free 
from milk and salt. 

Apple Fie. 

Pare; core and cut in eighths, 5 or 6 sour apples. Put 
a layer into an under crust; heap in the remainder, mak- 
ing a little higher in the centre; add ]/i cup of sugar, a 
sprinkling of either nutmeg or cinnamon, whichever 
flavor is preferred, a pinch of salt, 1 , tea-spoonful of 

140

lemon juice, a little grated rind of the lemon, and put 
bits of butter over the top. Bake in a moderate oven 
that the apples may become thoroughly cooked. 

Apple Fie for Dyspeptics. 

Fill a deep earthen plate with slices of tart apples; 
add 34 cup of sugar, Y^ cup of water and Y^ tea-spoonful 
of cinnamon; sift on the top about a table-spoonful of 
flour. Cover with paste made according to the Pie 
Crust for Dyspeptics, rolled thick; bake until well brown 
and the apples tender, and a toothsome and harmless 
dessert will result. A little butter on the top of the fill- 
ing adds to the flavor of the pie, though not to its diges- 
tibility. If an undercrust is preferred, the same quan- 
tity will suffice, rolled thinner, and a small hollow plate 
used. 

Berry Pies. 

Berry pies are baked with two crusts. They can be 
made of either fresh or canned fruit. No rule can be 
given for adding sugar as the tartness of the fruit must

a quart of fruit. Sprinkle with flour to prevent cooking 
over in the oven.

PUDDINGS 

Puddings are of three kinds — boiled, steamed and 
baked. Allow a little longer time for steamng a pud- 
ding than for boiling. Boiling requires twice the time 
required for baking. 

Puddings that are to be boiled should be put into 
plenty of boiling water and kept at a steady boil. 

A baked pudding should be stirred once or twice after 
it has set, so that the fruit may not all sink to the bottom, 
while one that is boiled should be turned over for the 
same reason, and also to keep it from sticking to the bot- 
tom of the kettle. 

On removing a pudding tied in a cloth plunge it 
quickly into a basin of cold water and the cloth may 

146 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

readily be removed. The cloths used should be washed 
without soap unless very well rinsed afterwards. Just 
before filling the cloth dip it into boiling water, squeeze 
it and dredge it with flour.

ICE CREAMS AND ICES 

In making ice cream, the essential points are to use 
finely crushed ice, the right proportion of salt, and to beat 
the mixture thoroughly while freezing. Coarse rock salt 
should be used. Use i part of salt to 3 or 4 parts ice. 
It is easy to measure each with a saucer or samll pan. 
Pack solidly around the can a layer of ice 3 inches deep ; 
add a layer of salt, then another layer of ice, then salt, 
and so on until the freezer is full. Each layer should be 
packed closely, the freezer handle being turned occasion- 
ally to be sure it works properly. 

Place the cream in the freezer, remembering that the 
mixture will increase in bulk during the freezing, there- 
fore the can should never be more than Y-\ ^^^l- Turn 
the crank slowly at first. After the cream is frozen to 
a mush, turn the crank more rapidly; add ice and salt, if 
needed. Never draw off the salt water until the mixture 
is frozen. After the freezing is accomplished, draw off 
the water, remove the dasher and with a spoon, pack the 
cream solidly in the can. Replace the cover and if neces- 
sary add more ice. Cover the freezer with a piece of bur- 
lap or old carpet, wet with water and salt, or with news- 
papers, until cream is to be used. 

161 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK

pare the ice cream; then it will be well chilled when the 
cream is poured in.

til nearly stiff; open freezer and add m^ashed fruit, either

Marshm allows and cherries are another pleasant combi- 
nation.

FRUITSAND DAINTY WAYS TO SERVE THEM 

In serving fruit, breakfast's principal attraction, al- 
ways arrange with an eye to color, and have the fruit 
well chilled. A good idea is to wash the fruit at night 
and place in the refrigerator. This gives to grapes, a 
dewy appearance, and a freshness that is appetizing. 
Arrange your bowl with the large fruit, such as apples, 
oranges, pears, etc., at the bottom, stick bananas here 
and there; let the grapes gracefully droop over and put 
the smaller fruit on the top. 

Baked Apples. 

Peel and core the apples and place in a shallow pan 
with a piece of butter in each; sprinkle generously with 
sugar and a little cinnamon ; put 3 cups of water in the 
pan and cook until the apples are nearly done, basting 
often. Put in the oven and bake. The apples should 
be nearly transparent when done. Serve with whipped 
cream. 

Bananas. 

Cut the ends from the bananas, just before serving, 
otherwise the fruit will turn dark at the ends ; loosen the 

166 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

skins; lay on a fruit plate for individual service; raise 
the skin on one side; sprinkle with lemon juice and pow- 
dered sugar. 

Baked Bananas. 

Peel the bananas; lay in a shallow pan; add lemon 
juice, bits of butter, a sprinkling of sugar and a little 
water. Bake until a light brown color. 

Fried Bananas. 

Put 3 table-spoonfuls of butter in a skillet; melt; lay 
in the peeled bananas which have been sprinkled with 
lemon juice and a little salt; fry until of a light brown 
color, turning several times.. 

Canteloupe Delmonico. 

Select canteloupe of uniform size; remove the seeds; 
scoop out the pulp and mix with red raspberries and red 
currants; refill; chill and serve with whipped cream. 

Grape Fruit. 

Cut in scolloped edges ; loosen the fruit from the shell 
and all fibers as much as possible; sprinkle with pow- 
derer sugar; pour over a teaspoonful of rum or Port wine. 
Sherry, Madeira or Maraschino may be used. 

Oranges California Style. 

Select nice oranges; cut off the top to serve as a lid; 
scoop out the pulp with a sharp spoon, saving the juice 

167 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

for the orange-ade. Make the shells neat and clean; put 
in shaved ice and orange-ade to which has been added 
grape juice; sweeten to taste. Cut a hole in the lid to 
admit a straw ; put on the lid and tie white satin ribbon 
around the fruit with a bow on the top; insert straw. 
This makes a pretty first course for luncheon. 

Peaches a la Mode. 
Dip several pieces of buttered toast in a little hot 
water; spread with peanut butter; slice ripe peaches over 
the top; and pour over all, whipped cream sweetened. 

Baked Fears. 
Remove the stems and cores ; cut a piece from the end 
so the pears will stand in a pan ; add butter, cinnamon, 
plenty of sugar and water to baste. Bake and serve with 
whipped cream. 

Pineapple and Strawberries. 

Prepare at noon for six o'clock dinner. Slice or dice 

pineapple in a glass dish; cover with sugar; add a layer 

of strawberries ; add sugar ; then a layer of pineapple and 

so on until all the fruit is used, finishing with the berries. 

Watermelon. 
Cut off one end of the watermelon so it will stand; cut 
off the opposite end to serve as a lid; polish the outside 
and arrange on nasturtium leaves and blossoms and send 
to the table ; scoop out with a large serving spoon for in- 
dividual services.

PRESERVES 

The kettles used for preserving, pickling, etc., should 
be of granite, or porcelain lined and the spoons used for 
stirring should be of granite or wood. 

Keep watch of the market and buy your fruit in sea- 
son; in this way you will get the best fruit at the lowest 
price. Be sure that the fruit is fresh, and not over ripe. 

Preserving fruit is cooking it in from three-fourths 
to its full weight in sugar. Canning fruit is sterilizing 
it by boiling and putting it into air tight jars. Canned 

180 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

fruit is sweetened to taste, allowing sugar according to 
the tartness of the fruit. For either preserving or can- 
ning, the syrup should be made by cooking the sugar and 
water together, and then the fruit cooked in the syrup. 

For canning, weigh the fruit, and put into the ket- 
tle in which the syrup is to be made sugar amounting to 
1/3 the weight of the fruit. To this add 3 cups of 
water to each pound of sugar, unless the fruit is very 
juicy, in which case less water is needed. 

For preserving, prepare the syrup with sugar amount- 
ing to from three-fourths to the full weight of the fruit 
and allow 1 cup of water to each pound of sugar, unless 
the fruit is very juicy in which case, only enough water 
to wet the sugar is needed. 

Berries and soft fruit may be dropped into the syrup 
and allowed to come to a boil, but pineapples and other 
hard fruit must be first cooked in boiling water until soft 
and then dropped into the syrup. Keep the fruit well 
skimmed while cooking. 

Sterilize the cans by putting into cold water, allow- 
ing the water to come to a boil. 

Wring a towel out of hot water, fold and put under 
the can while filling with the hot fruit. 

Remember that the fruit must be at the boiling point 
when put into the jars. 

Pint jars are more convenient for small families. 

If a spoon is inserted around the mouth of the jar, 
after the fruit is put in, the air bubbles will come to the 

181 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

top. After this is done, overflow the can with boiling 
water. Have two rubbers on the can and screw on the 
top as soon as possible after filling. Let stand until 
cold and screw down again, as tightly as possible. Fruit 
should be kept in a cool, dark, and above all a dry place. 
Any of the following canning recipes may be made into 
preserving recipes by altering the amount of sugar used, 
and vice versa. 

Cherries. 

Look over carefully; seed the cherries and for every 
pound of fruit add i pound of sugar. Cook until syrup 
thickens, keeping well skimmed; put in jars and follow 
Directions for Canning and Preserving. Canned cher- 
ries make excellent winter pies and may be canned with 
very little sugar, more to be added when the pies are 
made. Label your cherries for pies so that you will not 
mistake them for preserved cherries. 

Spiced Grapes. 

Remove the skins from Concord grapes, putting the 
pulp in one kettle and the skins in another; strain the 
pulp and add the juice to the skins. To each cup of 
skins and juice allow 2/3 of a cup of sugar, and 2 table- 
spoonfuls of vinegar, 2 level tea-spoonfuls each of 
ground cloves and allspice and 1 tea-spoonful of cinna- 
mon. Put all in a kettle together and boil hard for 5 
minutes; put in jelly glasses. If there are no covers to 
the glasses, cover with paraffine.

Coffee, whether ground or unground, should be kept 
in air tight canisters. For filtered coffee, it should be 
finely ground but for boiled coffee, may be ground coarse 
or medium. 

Boiled Coffee, No. i. 

Never use a tin coffee pot for boiled coffee, and always 
scald the granite pot before using. Keep absolutely free 
from coffee and particles of egg, by scouring. If a small 
family of two or three persons are to be served with cof- 
fee, one egg may be made to settle the coffee for three or 
four mornings. Put the amount of coffee you will need, 
allowing i heaping tea-spoonful for each person for i 
morning, in a mixing bowl; add i egg, slightly beaten, 
and the crushed shell; add i cup of cold water; stir thor- 
oughly; put the coffee in the pot; add boiling water; 
stuff spout of the pot with paper; boil for 3 minutes, 
never longer. Add Yi cup of cold water to complete the 
settling; let stand on the back of the range, where it will 
not boil, for 9 or 10 minutes. 

Boiled Coffee, No. 2. 

For each cup of water allow 1 heaping dessert-spoon- 
ful of finely ground coffee; put coffee in mixing bowl; 
add 1 egg (or Yi egg) ; mix thoroughly, adding a little 

igi 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

cold water. Turn the coffee into pot and add, measuring 
with a coffee-cup, the required water — cold. Stuff spout 
of pot with piece of brown paper to prevent escape of 
aroma. Cook slowly, stirring from time to time. It 
should not come to a boil in less than 10 minutes. Allow 
to boil from i to 3 minutes. Settle with a small quan- 
tity of cold water. Serve in the pot in which coffee is 
made. 

French Drip or Filtered Coffee. 

For each cup of coffee to be served, allow 1 heaping 
tea-spoonful of coffee, ground fine. If a drip coffee pot 
is used, pour over the coffee, the quantity of boiling wa- 
ter you wish to serve; allow to drip through the coffee 
and pour through the second time. If a percolator which 
pumps is used, start the coffee with cold water and allow 
to pump for 15 or 20 minutes over a moderate blaze. 

Black Coffee. 

Prepare the same as Filtered Coffee, or Boiled Coffee, 
doubling the amount of coffee ; serve in after dinner cof- 
fee cups with or without block sugar. 

Iced Coffee. -^ . 

Prepare either Filtered Coffee or Boiled Coffee accord- 
ing to directions, making a little stronger than for 
coffee which is to be served hot. Fill tall glasses full of 
cracked ice ; pour over the coffee. Serve with cream and 

192

sugar. Whipped cream is especially nice with Iced Cof- 
fee. 

Chocolate. 

Shave ij/i squares of Baker's chocolate into a sauce- 
pan and melt in a double boiler or over the tea-kettle; 
add 3 table-spoonfuls of sugar and a pinch of salt; add 
slowly, stirring constantly, i cup of boiling water; let 
come to a boil; scald 3 cup-fuls of milk and add to the 
chocolate ; let come to a boil ; serve in chocolate cups with 
whipped cream. If sweet chocolate is used, add very 
little sugar. 

Iced Chocolate. 

Make chocolate according to the directions, allowing 
2 squares of chocolate instead of i^^ as for hot chocolate. 
Fill tall glasses 1/3 full of cracked ice ; pour in the choco- 
late ; top with whipped cream. 

Cocoa. 

Mix 3 tea-spoonfuls of prepared cocoa with 2 table- 
spoonfuls of sugar and a pinch of salt; add Yi cup of 
boiling water and stir until the paste is smooth; add \]/i 
cups more of boiling water and let all come to a boil. 
Put 2 cups of sweet milk in a saucepan and scald and 
add to the cocoa. Beat with a Dover egg-beater until a 
froth begins to form.

THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Tea. 

There is much diversity of opinion regarding tea. 
Many prefer the green teas, others the black and some 
like a mixture. Use your own taste in the matter. 
Pour fresh boiling water into the pot and allow it to 
warm before brewing the tea. Allow a tea-spoonful of 
tea for each person to be served and one tea-spoonful for 
the pot. Pour boiling water over the tea and allow to 
stand for three minutes on the back of the stove or in a 
warm place. Never allow the tea to boil. 

Clove T'ea. 

Follow the recipe for making tea, allowing 3 whole 
cloves for each person to be served. 

Iced T'ea. 

Follow recipe for making tea, allowing 2 tea-spoon- 
fuls of tea for each person to be served, instead of 1 as 
for hot tea. Fill tall glasses 1/3 full of cracked ice and 
fill with the strong tea. Serve with a slice of lemon. 

Russian Tea. 

Follow recipe for making tea; serve with a slice of 
lemon, sugar if desired, but no cream. 

Miscellaneous. 
Blackberry Cordial. 
Mash the blackberries; strain, and to every quart of 
juice, add Yi pint of boiling water; let stand until the 

194 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

next day; strain and add Yi pound of sugar to every 
(]uart of Cordial. Put in bottles and cork tightly. 

Black Currant Juice. 

To each cup of currant juice add 2 cups of weak green 
tea; sweeten to taste; serve in punch glasses half filled 
with chopped ice and a sprig of mint. This makes a 
delicious and wholesome drink for a hot day. 

Currant Wine. 

Mash the currants; strain, and to every quart of juice, 
add 3 pounds of loaf sugar, and enough water to make 
a gallon of wine. Prepare the same as Blackberry 
Wine. 

Eau Sucre. 

Eau Sucre has been handed down from generation to 
generation as an integral part of the life of the Creole 
household. To i glass of fresh water allow a half tea- 
spoonful of sugar; stir until the sugar is dissolved and 
drink after a hearty meal. The Creole claims this cus- 
tom accounts for the freedom from that American disease 
— indigestion — which they most singularly enjoy. 

Egg-Nog. 

For one glass of egg-nog, beat the yolk of i egg until 
light; add i table-spoonful of sugar, i table-spoonful of 
the best brandy or whisky, stir well and add to a glass 
nearly full of cream or rich milk; beat the white of an 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

egg and add to the contents of the glass. Grate nutmeg 
over the top if desired. 

Iced Fruit Juices. 

When preserving or canning, bottle all left-over 
juices for the hot summer days. When diluted with 
water and sweetened to taste, they make delicious 
drinks. Serve with shaved ice. (Left-over coffee, 
drained from the grounds and served with cream over 
shaved ice also makes a delicious drink.) 

Fruit Punch. 

Make a punch of 12 lemons, 6 oranges, 2 pineapples, 
1 pint of strong tea, 1 pint of Port or Sherry wine, and 1 
gallon of water; sweeten to taste. Put a good sized 
block of ice in the punch bowl and pour the mixture over 
the ice, adding brandied cherries. For individual ser- 
vice, allow the juice of 1 orange, the same of lemon, 1 
table-spoonful of wine, and the fruit. Pour over chop- 
ped ice arranged in individual glasses; sweeten to taste 
and fill the glasses with water. 

Grape Juice. 

Pick over and wash 1 peck of grapes, Concord prefer- 
red. Put in a stew kettle with just enough water to pre- 
vent their burning. Heat until the seeds come out 
easily; strain through a bag; add 3 pounds of sugar; 
return to the fire; heat to the boiling point; bottle and 

196 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

seal. Do not dilute with water until ready to use as 
the grape juice keeps better when put up this way. 

Koumiss. 

Into 1 quart of fresh milk, put i gill of fresh butter- 
milk, 4 lumps of loaf sugar and let stand over night. 
Stir well and see that the sugar dissolves. In the morn- 
ing it will be thick; pour from one vessel to another until 
it becomes smooth and uniform in consistency. Bottle 
and keep in a warm place for twenty-four hours. The 
bottles must be tightly corked and the corks tied down. 
Shake well before using. This koumiss is good for in- 
valids and children. The richer the milk, the better 
will be the koumiss. A little cream may be added to the 
milk. 

Lemonade. 

Boil 1 pint of water and i cup of sugar for lO minutes. 
Squeeze the juice from 3 lemons; add the syrup and a 
few pieces of the peel ; cool ; strain ; add cold water and 
cracked ice to taste. 

Lemonade with Grape Juice.

To a glass of rich, sweetened milk, add 2 table-spoon- 
fuls of brandy; serve very cold with shaved ice. 

Mint Cup. 

Put several mint leaves into a tall glass; till full of 
shaved ice; add the juice of 1 lemon, and 2 slices of 
orange; sweeten to taste; fill the glass with water. 

Mint Julep. 

Place in a tumbler 1 lump of sugar in a little water. 
Dissolve thoroughly. In this bruise 3 or 4 of the young, 
tender leaves of mint. Fill the tumbler with fineh^ 
crushed ice. Add a jigger of Bourbon whisky and a half

BREAD, CAKES AND CEREALS 

BREAD 

Yeast is a plant, and the most favorable temperature 
for its growth is 65° to 68° F. Sugar is added to hasten 
fermentation. Dough made from yeast and flour is said 
to be "light" when it has doubled its bulk. If too light, 
the bread will be full of large holes, if not light enough, 
it will be soggy. If it is desired to bake the bread 
same day it is set, more yeast must be used. The loaves 
should continue to rise for the first 10 minutes after 
being put into the oven ; it should brown during the next 
20 minutes and during the last 15 minutes the heat 
should be reduced. As biscuits and rolls are thinner, 
they may be baked in a hotter oven than is used for 
bread. The crust will be tender if the loaf is rubber 
with melted butter as soon as taken from the oven. 

Teast. 

Boil 6 medium sized potatoes until soft; drain and 
mash. Add hot water to the water in which the potatoes 
were boiled until you have a quart. Stir into this, Y^ of 
a cup of flour which has been moistened with sufficient 
water to make a paste; add 1 table-spoonful of salt, 2 
table-spoonfuls of sugar, the mashed potatoes, and let 
all come to a boil, stirring to prevent lumping. When 
nearly cool add 2 dissolved Yeast Foam cakes. This 
makes 1J/2 quarts of yeast, Yi cup of which will raise an 

203 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

ordinary baking of bread. Keep in a cool place. The 
yeast plant is destroyed by either intense heat or cold. 
In preparing yeast again, Y^ ^^ ^ cup of the soft yeast 
may be used instead of the Yeast Foam. 

Bread, No. i. 

If you have not prepared yeast, very good bread may 
be made with y^ of a compressed yeast cake which must 
be used while fresh. To j/2 cup of prepared yeast or 
y^oi 2. compressed yeast cake, dissolved in a little warm 
water, add 1 pint of warm (not hot) water. Into this, 
sift 1 sifter full of flour. Let rise over night. In the 
morning add 1 tea-spoonful of salt, 1 table-spoonful of 
sugar, lard the size of 2 walnuts and enough flour to 
make a loaf which may be handled easily; knead well; 
let stand in a warm place until it doubles in bulk; make 
into small loaves; let stand until light and bake in a 
moderately hot oven, in buttered pans. 

Bread, No. 2. 

To 1 pint of lukewarm water add j/l cake of com- 
pressed yeast, dissolved in a little warm water. Sift 2 
quarts of flour into a mixing pan ; add 1 table-spoonful 
of sugar, 1 tea-spoonful of salt and 1 table-spoonful of 
soft butter; work well through the flour; make a hollow 
in the centre; add 1 pint of sweet milk, the water and 
yeast and work into a soft batter, leaving enough of the 
flour around the side of the pan to keep the dough from 
sticking to it. Cover and stand in a warm place to rise. 

204 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

When the batter is light enough to be made into a loaf, 
the top will be covered with bubbles. Stir in the flour 
which is in the pan and add enough more to make a loaf 
which may be easily handled; knead into loaves; let 
stand in a warm place until light; rub tops of the loaves 
with melted butter; bake in a moderately hot oven, shift- 
ing the loaves that they may be evenly baked. This 
makes 3 loaves of bread and a few light rolls. 

Breakfast Bread. 

To 2 cups of light dough (which may be taken from 
your bread-making), add iJ/4 cups of sugar, 1 cup of 
shortening (half butter), 2 eggs, and spices to taste. 
Mix well ; add ]/z cup of sweet milk, 1 scant tea-spoonful 
of soda, and 1 cup of seeded raisins, chopped. If too 
thin add a little flour. Bake in a slow oven from 30 to 
50 minutes in buttered pans. 

Brown Bread. 

Put Yi cup of sweet milk into a bowl ; add Yi cup of 
molasses. Into another Yi cup of molasses, put Yz tea- 
spoonful of soda and Y^ tea-spoonful of salt; put all 
together and add enough graham flour to make as thick 
as batter for corn bread. Bake in a buttered pan in a 
moderate oven. 

Boston Brown Bread. 

Sift together, 1 pint each of rye meal and corn meal; 
add 1 pint of sour milk in which 1 tea-spoonful of soda 

205 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

has been beaten, l cup of molasses and i tea-spoonful of 
salt. Stir until well mixed; pour into greased moulds 
with tight covers; steam for 3 hours, not allowing the 
water to stop boiling. If small loaves are desired, steam 
in one pound baking powder cans. 

Raisin and Nut Bread. 

Boil 1 pint of sweet milk; add 1 cup of rolled oats 
and cook to a mush; take from the fire; add 1 pint of 
scalded milk and 1 even tea-spoonful of salt. When 
lukewarm (not hot) add l cake of compressed yeast, dis- 
solved in a little warm water, 1 pint of whole wheat 
flour, Yi pound of stoned raisins, and 1 pound of Brazil 
nuts and English walnuts, chopped. Knead on a 
floured board until the loaf loses its stickiness and be- 
comes elastic; form into two loaves; put in a warm place 
until light; bake in a slow oven. 

Salt-rising Bread. 

Let 1 pint of fresh, sweet milk come to a boil. Wet 
2 heaping table-spoonfuls of corn-meal in a little water; 
add to the boiling milk; stir until it boils up well; re- 
move from the stove ; add Y^. tea-spoonful of soda, 1 tea- 
spoonful of salt, 1 tea-spoonful of sugar and Y^ ^^^" 
spoonful of ginger; stir all together well, leaving the 
silver spoon with which it is mixed, in the batter; cover 
and set in a warm place over night. In the morning add 
1 cup of lukewarm water and enough flour to make a stiff 

206 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

batter; set in a pan of warm water in a warm place until 
the yeast rises to the top of the vessel. Proceed as with 
any other light bread. 

Baking Powder Biscuit. 
To 2 cups of flour add 4 tea-spoonfuls of baking 
powder and a pinch of salt; sift; add 1 table-spoonful 
of lard and 1 table-spoonful of butter, or 2 table-spoon- 
fuls of either butter or lard. Work the shortening into 
the flour with the tips of the fingers ; add enough milk to 
make a soft dough; toss onto a floured board; roll out 
lightly to 3/2 inch thickness; cut with a biscuit cutter; 
bake in a very quick oven. Keep in mind that biscuit 
dough cannot be handled like raised bread dough, of 
which you make rolls. Kneading improves the bread 
dough, but biscuit dough must be handled as lightly and 
as little as possible. Do not try to shape the biscuits 
with the fingers as you do rolls. 

Sour Milk Biscuit. 
Sift 1 quart of flour to which has been added 1 tea- 
spoonful of salt; rub well into the flour, 1 table-spoonful 
of butter; put in pint of thick sour milk, to which has 
been added 1 tea-spoonful of soda, dissolved in a little 
warm water. Vary the amount of flour to make a soft 
dough, as no rule can apply to all flours. Read the cau- 
tion in regard to handling the dough under Baking 
Powder Biscuit, as the success of your biscuits depends 
upon this. 

207 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

^ea Biscuits. 

Prepare the same as for Baking Powder Biscuits. 
Roll thin; spread with butter and double; bake in a 
quick oven. Twin Biscuits may be made in the same 
way by cutting thin, spreading with butter and placing 
one on top of the other. 

Cheese Straws. 
Put a cup of flower on the mxing board; add a pinch 
of salt, a pinch of cayenne pepper and 2 table-spoonfuls 
of ice water chopped through the flour; toss together; 
roll on board; add 3 table-spoonfuls of ice water, 1/3 
pound of grated cheese, a little flour to knead; cut in 
strips and bake a light brown. 

Coffee Rolls. 
Take about the quantity of bread dough you would 
put into a loaf. Roll out until Y^ inch in thickness; 
spread with butter; put on a thick layer of sugar; grate 
l/z nutmeg over the top or sprinkle with cinnamon if 
that spice is preferred; roll up carefully. Cut slices 
from the end of the roll, about 1 inch in thickness; put 
in a pan three inches deep; let rise ; bake in a quick oven. 
If you would have the rolls good, use plenty of butter 
and sugar. Mrs. Baird. 

Corn Bread.

Put 3 cups of warm milk and 1 tea-spoonful of salt 
into a mixing bowl; stir in sufficient flour to make a stiff 
batter ; add 34 cup of sugar and Yi cup of butter beaten 
together; add l well-beaten egg, and 1 yeast cake, dis- 
solved in 34 cup of warm water; beat all together, add- 
ing enough more flour to make the batter stiff. Set to 
rise and when light, turn onto a floured board and knead 
into a loaf; set to rise again and when light make into 

209

rolls any desired shape. Rub the top of the rolls with 
the beaten whites of eggs, mixed with a little lard and 
bake in a quick oven. 

Dumplings. 

To 1 pint of flour add 3 table-spoonfuls of baking 
powder and 1 tea-spoonful of salt; sift and add enough 
milk to make a stiff dough. Cut in squares and cook 20

corn-meal, and sift twice. Have 3 pints of hot water in 
the double boiler; add 2 tea-spoonfuls of salt, and 
sprinkle in the flour and meal, stirring constantly to pre- 
vent lumping; cook 3 hours; pour into a flat dish. In 
the morning, cut in slices, dip in sifted flour and fry 
quickly in hot fat. Serve very hot. 

CAKES ■• 

Fine cakes require the best materials. Be sure that 
the eggs and milk are fresh, and always use the best but- 
ter. Swansdown cake flour is very good and the best 
results are had from the use of the Jennie Lisk cake tins. 
Use an earthen bowl, never tin, and a wooden or silver 
spoon. Drop eggs in cold water just before using. 
Line the cake tin with buttered paper; cut out the cor- 
ners to make the paper fit the tin. A hotter oven should 
be used than for bread. Thin cakes, such as layer and 
sponge cakes should be baked 15 to 20 minutes; thicker 
cakes, from 30 to 40 minutes; loaf cakes an hour and 
heavy fruit cakes from 3 to 4 hours. If the cake browns 
before rising, the oven is too hot ; if it cracks open across 
the top, the cake dough is too stiff. Beat the whites and 
yolks of eggs, separately. Measure all ingredients 
carefully. Have everything ready before you begin to 
put the cake together. Rub the butter and sugar to- 
gether with a spoon, until of a creamy consistency. Beat 

214 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

the yolks until light; and beat again after adding the 
butter and sugar. Next add the flavoring. The milk 
and flour should be added alternately and always well 
beaten. Whether you use soda and cream of tartar, or 
baking powder, it should be sifted into the dough with 
the flour. Always beat the whites to a stiff froth and 
fold into the dough last, except in sponge cakes. In 
making sponge cake the whites and yolks of the eggs 
should be beaten separately and then put together when 
adding the sugar. Remove the cake from the pan as 
soon as possible after baking. Always beat^ never stir^ 
cake dough. 

Use your best judgment in the use of flour for cake 
dough. No set rule can be given as some flours make a 
stiffer dough than others, even when the same amount is 
used. Note the thickness of your dough, and when suc- 
cessful, aim for the exact consistency next time.

to cook while preparing the evening meal, and reheat in 
the morning. Put i cup of oatmeal in the top part of 
the double boiler; this will take nearly a quart of boiling 
water; set over the fire until it boils up well; place over 
the hot water and cook for 2 or 3 hours. If liked dry, 
oatmeal may be eaten after being cooked from 40 to 60 
minutes. Serve with sugar and cream. 

Fettijoh72. 

This food is delicious, prepared according to the direc- 
tions on the package and served with sliced bananas.

Boiled Rice. 

Pick over and wash i cup of rice. Have 2 quarts of 
water boiling on the fire; add 2 tea-spoonfuls of salt; 
add the rice, very slowly, stirring constantly. The rice 
may now be cooked over the fire for 30 minutes or until 
soft, or it may be put into a double boiler and steamed 
for 45 minutes. When preparing rice for dessert, use 
half the quantity of water and when this is absorbed, 
add scalded milk. In case the rice is boiled over the fire; 
put it in a colander and allow cold water to run through 
it after it is done ; return to the fire over a vessel of boil- 
ing water and reheat before serving. If stirred with a 
fork during the cooking, the kernels will not be broken. 

Shredded Wheat Biscuit. 

Pour a table-spoonful of hot water over the biscuit 
and set in the oven to heat; serve with cream and sugar.

EGGS 

To test eggs place the large end (which contains the 
life of the egg) to the tongue. It should grow warm im- 
mediately, while the small end will remain cold. Un- 
less the egg is in this condition it is unfit for the stomach. 
Eggs should always be kept on ice or in a very cold place. 

Baked Eggs. 

Butter your muffin pans or egg cups and drop an egg 
into each cup, taking care not to break the yolks. Season 
with salt and pepper; bake until the whites become hard 
and firm; serve with toast and garnish with parsley. 

Boiled Eggs. 

Put eggs in cold water and when the water boils hard 
you have a delicately boiled egg. The white will be 
velvety and not tough. For medium boiled, allow 5 
minutes; for hard boiled, 10 to 15 minutes. Another 
way is to boil the water and while the water is at the 
boiling heat, drop in your eggs and let stand 10 or 15 
minutes. 

Italian Eggs on T^oast. 

Boil 6 eggs 15 minutes; chop the whites and rub the 
yolks through a sieve. Make a cream dressing as fol- 
lows: 2 table-spoonfuls of melted butter, 2 cups of 
warm milk; mix with the chopped whites. Serve on 
toast and scatter the yolks on top. 

239 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Plain Omelet. 
Beat the whites to a stiff froth that will stand alone, 
and the yolks to a smooth cream; add to the yolks, salt, 
pepper and a little milk; then beat in the whites with 
the egg beater; have the skillet hot and when the butter 
hisses, pour in the egg mixture ; do not stir, but if there 
is a tendency to stick, run a broad knife blade under the 
omelet. If your oven is hot, set the omelet in for a few 
minutes as this will help make it form. When turning 
out on a platter, be careful not to break the omelets. 
Omelets should be served immediately, as they fall and 
flatten out from standing. 

Washington Omelet. 
Put 1 cup of milk into a skillet; let it come to a boil, 
pour it over i cup of bread crumbs and let stand to cool 
a little. Then break 6 eggs and stir into the bread 
crumbs and milk until it is well mixed; season with salt 
and pepper and pour into a hot skillet; fry slowly, cut in 
squares and turn. Fry a delicate brown and serve at 
once. Mrs. M. M. Snyder. 

Pickled Eggs. 
Have eggs hard boiled, remove the shells and cut in 
halves across; remove the yolks into a bowl; chop some 
mustard pickles; add yolks; season with salt, red pepper, 
a little of the mustard, and vinegar, and mix to a paste. 
Refill the whites and serve on lettuce leaf with Mayon- 
naise Dressing as a relish. 

240 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Poached Eggs. 

Open the eggs carefully, one at a time so as not to 
break them and place on a wet saucer; slip them into 
boiling water which has salt and vinegar added; cook 
about 3 minutes; lift carefully with a perforated skim- 
mer so as to drain off all the water; serve on buttered 
toast. 

Scalloped Eggs. 

Have as many hard boiled eggs as there are persons to 
serve. Slice them; place a layer of finely rolled bread 
crumbs in the bottom of a baking dish; season with salt 
and pepper; add a layer of sliced eggs, highly seasoned; 
add more bread crumbs and seasoning and so on until 
all are used, having bread crumbs on top. Cover this 
with bits of butter and enough hot sweet milk to thor- 
oughly moisten all bread crumbs; cover and bake 15 
minutes; remove cover and brown and serve at once. 

C. S. E. 
Scrambled Eggs. 

Break eggs in a warm buttered skillet taking care not 
to break the yolks; season with salt, pepper and a little 
butter. When the whites begin to set, stir gently from 
the bottom until the eggs are cooked as desired. 

Shirred Eggs. 
Beat the eggs thoroughly and season with salt, butter 
and pepper. Butter egg cups or muffin pans ; pour eggs 
in and bake until firm. 

241 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Stuffed Eggs. 

Take number of eggs desired and boil hard; break off 
shell; cut in halves, across; remove yolks, being careful 
not to break the hard boiled white. Put yolks in a chop- 
ping bowl and mash to a paste and then add a few mus- 
tard pickles chopped fine. Season with pepper and salt 
and serve on a lettuce leaf with Mayonnaise Dressing. 

Eggs and T^omatoes, 

Select as many round, firm tomatoes as there are per- 
sons to be served. Wash them and cut a thin slice off 
the top of each for a cover and scoop out sufficient space 
to admit an egg. Put in each a little butter; drop in the 
egg, taking care not to separate the white and yolk, sea- 
son with salt and pepper; place a dot of butter on each 
egg and a little minced parsley on the butter. Replace 
the cover and bake about 20 minutes in a hot oven.

HOUSEHOLD HINTS 

The Dinner Table. 

Much tact is required in entertaining at dinner. The 
most important factor of dinner-giving is the selection 
of guests ; these should be congenial, and to this end the 
hostess should exercise her very best judgment. 

Those guests present who do not meet frequently 
should be seated next each other, and it is a happy result 
when a good conversationalist is placed beside a guest of 
retiring disposition. Where the company is composed 
of both ladies and gentlemen, they should be alternated. 
The hostess should contrive to have everything possible 
pertaining to her dinner, done, before the arrival of the 
guests, in order that she may devote all the time she can 
before dinner to her friends, making them feel at home 
and seeing that they are properly introduced. 

297 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

In dressing the table, the table felt is placed first; then 
the spotless linen. A warm flatiron will remove the 
creases from the tablecloth, and give a smooth attrac- 
tive surface ; next the dainty centerpiece is added with a 
vase or basket of flowers, or perhaps a more elaborate 
floral design. The napkins should be neatly folded and 
placed either in front or immediately to the right of each 
place, depending entirely upon whether or not soup is 
to be served before the guests are seated or afterward 
from a tureen. The silver should be laid in line with 
courses to be served — from right to left toward the plate 
— in this order; cocktail fork, soup spoon, fish fork, and 
dinner knife. Put the salad fork, dinner fork, and des- 
sert fork to the left of the plate. The desired number of 
tea spoons and the coffee spoon should be placed in front 
of each plate. The bread-and-butter plate should be a 
little to the left and in front, with its ball of butter and 
the spreader. The water glass and wine glass should be 
placed at the right, and individual salt cups should be at 
the left of the plate. Olives, celery, radishes, and any 
relish may be placed on the table with the soup course. 

The menu usually runs in the order given : An appe- 
tizer, such as cocktails or grape fruit ; Russian caviare on 
toasted crackers; soup, celery and salted wafers; fish, 
always boiled or baked, never fried, with sauce or jelly; 
meat, sauces, gravy or jelly; vegetables, bread or biscuit; 
entrees; salad and wafers; dessert, creams, ices, cake, pie 
or pudding; salted almonds, cheese, crackers, coffee, 

258 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

candy mints. Finger bowls should always be passed with 
the last course. The hostess should always see that the 
guests have finished each course before laying aside her 
silver. When the meal has come to a close the hostess 
rises and with the ladies adjourns to the parlor or the 
drawing room, while the gentlemen seek a cozy den or 
nook to enjoy their cigars. 

In the Kitchen. 

In furnishing your kitchen, study well your space. If 
you do not want a bare floor, cover it with a pretty piece 
of linoleum or a heavy piece of oil-cloth; in the end the 
linoleum is far the cheaper as it wears three or four times 
as long. Have the colors correspond with the tinting of 
the wall. 

At the windows hang pretty Swiss sash curtains on 
rods that can be easily taken down for the curtains to be 
washed; two sets are necessary. 

Next add a modern kitchen cabinet; study well its 
convenience and size, and do not select one so large that 
no place is left in a small kitchen for anything else. Add 
two kitchen chairs, and enamel them a pretty bright red. 
A kitchen should have a clock, a roller towel and on the 
drain of the sink, a soap dish and a bottle of ammonia. 

There is nothing prettier than an attractive kitchen 
and pantry, and if one is doing one's own work, the 
temptation will be to add many pretty things, such as 
white porcelain made up in various pans, kettles, sauce- 

259 



THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 



pans, pie pans, jelly cake pans, cups, bowls, pitchers, 
molds, etc. 

The pantry should contain nothing but the kitchen 
utensils, kitchen dishes, dry groceries, and articles not 
kept in the ice box. A dainty sash curtain should be 
hung at the pantry window. When putting your pan- 
try in order, after washing and drying the shelves, 
sprinkle well with powdered borax. This will insure 
you against troublesome insects. Put on the fancy white 
paper. Arrange the pans, etc. Spices, dried fruits, 
herbs, etc., should be kept in covered boxes.

Be very careful in selecting an icebox ; a good one will 
last a lifetime. See that it is perfectly sanitary in its 
construction — that it can be largely taken apart, washed, 
and disinfected. Select one that has a separate com- 
partment for milk and butter as they absorb the odor of 
other things very readily. The icebox must be kept 
sweet and clean; should be washed every time fresh ice 
is put in, and the drain pipes and slides thoroughly aired 
in the sunshine at least once a week. 

The china closet should contain only the china that 
goes on the dining table. If one is handling the dainty 
pieces themselves, there is no reason why the best ones 
cannot be used, if so desired ; otherwise, it is well to have 
a pretty semi-porcelain set for everyday use. 

In washing the dishes a fine lustre is given by adding 
ammonia to the hot suds. Scald before wiping, taking 
care not to allow boiling water to touch the glassware. 
Rinse out the dish towels and hang in the air to dry.

THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

A little cornstarch mixed with salt will keep it from 
lumping. 

An oyster shell put in the teakettle will collect the 
crust that forms in the kettle and thus save the kettle 
from disagreeable roughness. 

Add a little turpentine to the water when washing 
the windows or the stove. 

Flaked breakfast food is greatly improved by warm- 
ing in the oven, leaving the oven door open to prevent 
burning. 

A small dish of water with a few drops of carbolic acid 
placed under the stove adds moisture, and disinfects.

WEIGHTS AND MEASURES 

To be successful in cooking one must be very accurate 
in weighing and measuring. It is well to be provided 
with a regular measuring cup which has lines indicating

THE BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

the smallest portion of the cup and the full capacity. 
Flour, sugar, and soda should always be sifted before 
measuring. In measuring by the spoonful always level 
off with the point of a knife^ unless the recipe calls for 
a heaping spoonful. In measuring half a spoonful of 
any dry ingredient level off and cut in half lengthwise, 
never crosswise. To obtain quarters, measure across the 
half. An eighth of a tea-spoonful is really the myster- 
ious "pinch" of any ingredient that so often puzzles 
cooks. Butter or lard should be measured solid in the 
cup or spoon.
