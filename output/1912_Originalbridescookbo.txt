pounds of Sperry flour in a deep pan, make a hole in the center of 
the flour, into which pour one quart of warm water, in which has been dis- 
solved one cake of Consumers' Compressed Yeast. Then with a large 
spoon beat the mixture well, cover with flour and set to rise in a warm 
place. In two or two and a half hours it will be ready for kneading. 
Dissolve a handful of salt in about three pints of warm water, with which 
make the whole into a soft smooth dough. Knead well with the hands 
and set to rise for two or three hours. Then work and make into loaves ; 
set to rise about two to three hours ; then bake in a good hot oven. 

Brown Bread 

One pint Indian corn meal, one pint rye flour, one teaspoon brown 
sugar, one teaspoon salt, two teaspoons baking powder, one tablespoon 
butter or lard, three-quarters pint milk. Sift together corn meal, rye 
flour, sugar, salt and powder. Rub in the shortening; add the milk and 
mix all into a batter. Put into greased tin and bake about forty minutes 
in a rather hot oven. Cover at first with paper. 

Graham Bread — Unfermented 

One and one-half pints graham flour, one-half pint of Sperry 
flour, one tablespoon sugar, one teaspoon salt, two teaspoons baking pow- 
der, one and one-quarter pints milk, or equal parts milk and water. Sift 
graham flour, flour, sugar, salt and powder together ; add the milk, or milk 
and water; mix rapidly into soft dough, then put in greased tin. Bake in 
rather hot oven about forty minutes. Protect loaf with paper first fifteen 
minutes. 

Corn Bread 

One cup fine white corn meal, one and one-half cups milk, two eggs, 
one teaspoon sugar, one tablespoon butter, two level teaspoons baking 
powder, one-quarter teaspoon salt. Scald the milk and pour on the corn 
meal. Let it cool, then add salt, sugar, baking powder and yolks of eggs 
and beat quickly and thoroughly together. Fold in the stiffly beaten 
whites of eggs. Bake in a flat pan in hot oven for about thirty minutes. 

Baking Powder Biscuits 

Sift together three cups of Sperry flour, one scant teaspoonful of 
salt and three teaspoons of baking powder. Chop into this with a knife 
one teaspoonful each of lard and butter, then add gradually about one cup 
of milk, making a soft dough that can be easily handled. Take on board 
and knead gently. Cut in small rounds and bake fifteen to twenty min- 
utes in moderately quick oven.

Corn Fritters 

To one pint scraped corn add one-half cup milk, one-half cup Sperry 
flour, one tablespoon melted butter, two beaten eggs, one teaspoon salt, 
one-third teaspoon pepper, one teaspoon baking powder. Beat well, and 
fry in small spoonfuls as directed. 

Plain Shortcake 

Take two cupfuls of Sperry flour, two tablespoonfuls of butter, 
one cupful of milk, one teaspoonful of baking powder, one egg and _a 
little salt. Beat thoroughly with a spoon. Pour this into the baking-pan 
and smooth a little with a spoon. 

Peach or Strawberry Shortcake 

Rub piece of butter the size of an tgg into a little Sperry flour, pour 
in two cupfuls of sour cream, one teaspoonful of soda and a little salt. 
Mix into dough and roll into cakes one-half of an inch thick and about 
the size of a pie tin. Prick with a fork and bake in a quick oven. When 
done split them open with a knife and spread with butter, lay the bottom 
piece on a plate- and cover it with strawberries nearly an inch deep. 
The strawberries should be sprinkled with sugar a few hours before. 

Rice Fritters 

Take one cup of cold boiled rice, one pint of flour, one teaspoonful 
of salt, two eggs beaten lightly, and milk enough to make this a thick 
batter, beat all together well and bake on a griddle. 

Doughnuts — No. 2 

One cupful of sugar, two eggs beaten light, one tablespoonful of 
melted butter, one cupful of sweet milk, two teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder and one very small teaspoonful of salt. Season to taste. Sperry 
flour to knead as soft as possible. Fry in hot lard. Sour milk is as 
good by using one level teaspoonful of soda. 

Crullers 

One and oue-half cups sugar, one cup milk, two eggs, two table- 
spoons butter, melted, one teaspoon vanilla, one teaspoon powdered 
cinnamon, one-half teaspoon salt, two teaspoons baking powder mixed 
with two cups Sperry flour and more flour to make a soft dough. Roll 
out, cut in squares, cut slits in each with jagging-iron and braid together. 
Fray in smoking-hot fat. 

Crullers 

One cupful of milk, one cupful of sugar, two eggs, one tablespoonful 
lard, melted, one tablespoonful cinnamon, enough Sperry flour to make 
into dough. Roll as thin as possible, and cut in strips six inches long and 
one inch wide with a jagging iron or sharp knife. Fry in hot lard a very 
light delicate brown, and lay on a towel or paper to absorb the fat. Will 
keep indefinitely and if placed a few minutes in the oven, taste perfectly 
fresh.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Milk Toast 

Take one quart milk; when it comes to a boil, thicken with one 
teaspoonful corn starch and add salt to taste. Toast the bread a light 
brown ; butter each slice, put layers of toast in a covered dish and pour on 
the thickened milk, then more toast and milk, and so on till the dish is 
full ; cover and let stand five minutes. 

German Toast 

Cut slices of stale bread, dip them in enough milk to soften, then 
dip in beaten egg; put in a pan with just enough butter to fry brown 
as an omelet, then serve. Like pancakes, the hotter the toast the better. 

Ham Toast 

Chop cold boiled ham very fine, toast slices of bread and butter 
them. After laying the ham on the toast place in the oven for a few 
minutes. Beat up four eggs with milk and salt and pepper. Pour 
the eggs into a saucepan with a lump of butter and stir till thick, but 
do not boil. Put the ham and toast on a platter, pour the eggs over, and 
serve. 

Egg Toast 

Butter the toast and pour over it a sauce made of milk thickened 
with flour and seasoned with butter, pepper and salt ; add the whites of 
eggs chopped fine, and grate the yolks over the top. 

Mock Cream-Toast 

Melt one quart of morning's milk, about two ounces of butter, a 
large teaspoonful of Sperry flour, freed from lumps, and the yolks 
of three eggs beaten light; beat these ingredients together several min- 
utes ; strain the cream through a fine hair sieve, and when wanted heat it 
slowly, beating constantly with a brisk movement; it must not boil or it 
will curdle and lose the appearance of cream ; when hot dip the toast ; if 
not sufficiently seasoned with butter, add salt; send to the table hot, the 
cream not taken up by the toast, in a gravy bowl.

To Make Icing for Cakes 

Beat the whites of two small eggs to a froth, then add to them a 
quarter of a pound of white sugar, ground fine like flour, flavor with 
lemon extract or vanilla, beat it until it is light and very white, but 
not quite so stiff as kiss mixture ; the longer it is beaten the more firm it 
will become. No more sugar must be added to make it so. Beat the 
frosting until it may be spread smoothly on the cake. This quantity will 
ice quite a large cake over the top and sides. 

Marble Cake 

White Parts: — Whites of seven eggs, three cups white sugar, one 
of butter, one of sour milk, four cups of Sperry flour, sifted and 
heaping, one teaspoon soda ; flavor to taste. 

Dark Parts : — Yolks of seven eggs, three cups of brown sugar, one 
of butter, one of sour milk, four of Sperry flour, sifted and heaping, one 
tablespoon each of cinnamon, allspice and cloves, one teaspoon soda; put 
in pans a spoonful of white part and then a spoonful of dark part, and so 
on. Bake an hour and a quarter. Use coffee cups to measure. This 
will make one large and one medium cake. The white and darp parts are 
alternated, either putting in a spoonful of white then a dark or a layer 
of white and then of dark part, being careful that the cake may be nicely 
"marbleized." 

Chocolate Layer Cake 

Grate one cake of unsweetened chocolate, add four tablespoonfuls 
Sperry flour, two teaspoonfuls baking powder, one cupful of sugar, five 
eggs beaten with the sugar. Beat all fifteen minutes and bake in layers. 

Filling — One cupful of milk, one heaping teaspoonful of corn starch, 
mixed smooth in milk. Beat three eggs separately, add the yolks to the 
cupful of milk, add two teaspoonfuls of vanilla extract. When warm, 
add butter the size of a hickory nut and one-half cupful of sugar. Stir 
in the beaten whites when cool. 



Fig Cake 

Two cups of sugar, one of butter, one of cold water, with a tea- 
spoonful of soda dissolved in it; three cups of raisins, chopped fine, cinna- 
mon and nutmeg, four eggs, one pound of figs ; use the figs whole, cover- 
ing them well with the cake to prevent burning. Bake in layers, frosting 
between each layer. Make as stiff as pound cake. Cut with very sharp 
knife to prevent crumbling. This makes two loaves.

each layer on top of the other and sift powdered sugar on the top.

Lady Fingers 

Two eggs, one cup of sugar, one-half cup butter beaten to a cream, 
four tablespoons baking powder; enough Sperry flour to stir with a 
spoon ; lemon to flavor. For your molding board take a little piece of 
dough,' roll with your hands as large as your finger, cut off in four-inch 
lengths and put closely on buttered tins. Quick oven. 

Burnt Sugar Cake 

Take one cup of granulated sugar, place in a skillet and let it melt. 
Then pour in boiling water and stir until it is as thick as syrup. Now 
take one cup sugar, one cup good rich milk, one lump butter the size of 
an egg, three teaspoonfuls of baking powder, two tablespoonfuls of the 
burnt sugar, two eggs beaten well, Sperry flour enough to make stiff 
as a common cake. Sift the baking powder into the flour. Flavor 
with vanilla extract. To any good white icing add two tablespoonfuls 
of burnt sugar and put between and on top of layers. This is a four- 
layer cake. 

Soft Gingerbread 

One cup molasses, one-half cup sugar, one-half cup butter, one-half 
cup milk, two eggs, one tablespoon ginger, one teaspoon allspice, two 
cups Sperry flour, one and one-half teaspoons baking powder. Bake in

beating all well together. Finally add flour enough to make a soft dough. 
Roll rather thick, cut in fantastic shapes, "little gingerbread men," if 
to please the little folks, or any desired shape. Have a moderate heat 
only, as bread should not be baked too quickly. 

Cookies 

One cup butter (or one-half butter and one-half lard), one cup 
sugar, three eggs, one and one-half heaping teaspoons baking powder, 
grated rind of two lemons or use one teaspoon lemon flavoring. Sperry

sugar, one beaten egg, one teaspoonful of vinegar, one large teaspoonful 
of baking soda, dissolved in a little hot water, half a teaspoonful of 
ginger and other spices to taste. Enough Sperry flour to make a dough 
that can be rolled out. Roll thin, cut and bake.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 



Hermits 



One and one-half cupfuls of brown or maple sugar, one cupful of 
butter, one-half teaspoonful of soda dissolved in two tablespoonfuls of 
hot water, three eggs, a little nutmeg, pinch of salt, one and one-half 
cupfuls of seeded and floured raisins, three and one-half cupfuls of 
Sperry flour, in which one teaspoonful of cream of tartar has been 
sifted, and one-fourth cupful of buttermilk. Drop the dough from the 
spoon in small separate cakes. 

Molasses Cookies 

Take two cups of molasses, one cup of sugar, two cups of butter, 
four teaspoonfuls of alum, put in two cups of boiling water, four tea- 
spoonfuls of soda and Sperry flour enough to roll out. 



Fried Cakes 

One cup of sugar, two eggs, half a cup of shortening, one teaspoon 
of soda, one cup of sour milk, cut in rings ; have your lard very hot, 
in which place a peeled potato to keep lard from burning, and drop in 
your cakes; they will come to the top of the lard when light; fry a 
dark brown; when taken out sprinkle sugar over them. 




34 



Puff Paste 

One quart of Sperry flour, one pint of butter, or butter and lard 
half and half, a pinch of salt, one and one-quarter cupfuls of cold 
water. Sprinkle the salt in the flour and with the hands mix in quickly 
the shortening until all is smooth. Mix in the cold water quickly as pos- 
sible and roll out and fit to a pie plate. The flour on the crust is all that is 
needed to prevent the crust from sticking; cut off evenly around the edge 
of plate — gather up the scraps and make another sheet for the top of the 
pie and roll out the upper sheet a little thinner than the under crust, lap 
one half over the other and cut four or five small slits at the center. Fill 
the pie with prepared rilling, wet the edge of the rim to prevent the 
juices from running out, lay the upper crust across the center of the 
pie, turn back the half that is lapped, slightly press the edges down with 
your thumb, dipping occasionally into flour to prevent sticking. Bake 
to a light brown. 

Paste 

Three cups of Sperry flour (sifted), one large cup butter, one- 
half teaspoon baking powder, two tablespoons sugar, one-half cup milk. 
Sift flour with powder and sugar, rub in butter, add milk ; mix into a 
smooth dough of medium stiffness. 

German Paste 

Take three-quarters of a pound of Sperry flour, put into it half 
a pound of butter, the same of powdered sugar, and the peel of a lemon 
grated; make a hole in the middle of the flour, break in the yolk of 
two eggs, reserving the whites, which are to be well beaten ; then mix all 
well together. If the eggs do not sufficiently moisten the paste, add half 
an eggshell of water. Mix all thoroughly, but do not handle too much. 
Roll out thin, and it may be used for all sorts of pastry. Before putting 
it into the oven, wash over the pastry with the white of the beaten eggs, 
and shake over a little powdered sugar. 

Rich Short Crust 

Break ten ounces of butter into a pound of Sperry flour dried 
and sifted, add a pinch of salt and two ounces of loaf sugar rolled fine. 
Make it into a very smooth paste as light as possible, with two well- 
beaten eggs and sufficient milk to moisten the paste. 



To Ice Pastry 

To ice pastry, which is the usual method adopted for fruit and sweet 
dishes of pastry, put the white of an egg on a plate, and with the blade 
of a knife beat it to a stiff froth. When the pastry is nearly baked, brush 
it over with this, and sift over some powdered sugar ; put it back into 
the oven to set a glaze, and in a few minutes it will be done. Great care 
should be taken that the paste does not catch or burn in the oven, which 
it is very liable to do after the icing is. laid on. 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Lemon Pie

with egg yolks and sugar. After custard is done put on top the whites 
of the other two eggs, put in oven and brown. Bake pie crust first. 

Apple Pie 

Stew green or ripe apples, when you have pared and cored them.

crust, and either cross-bar the top with strips of paste, or bake without 
cover. Eat cold, with powdered sugar strewed over it. 

Pumpkin Pie 

The following measure will make three good sized pies : Put into 
your mixing dish one quart and a pint of stewed and strained pumpkin, 
about one-quarter pound sugar, half cup molasses, half a tablespoon 
ginger, less than half a tablespoon nutmeg, a scant teaspoonful each of 
cinnamon and salt, one-quarter cup melted butter and one quart of milk. 
Beat six 'eggs and add to the mixture, and stir until the ingredients 
are well blended. Bake in a good, deep crust. 

Rhubarb Pie

teacup of sugar, sprinkle with salt, shake over a little Sperry flour, cover 
with a crust, slit in the center, trim off the edge and bake in a quick oven 
until done. Rhubarb pies made in this way are superior to those made 
of the fruit stewed. 

Lemon Cream Pie 

Make a good pie crust and prick bottom. Put one cup sugar and one 
cup water in a saucepan and let come to a boil. Mix one tablespoon corn- 
starch in a little water and add to water and sugar on stove. When

in the yolks of two eggs and grated rind and juice of one lemon. Beat 
whites of two eggs until thick and spread over pie when cooked ; then 
put in oven to brown.

and strained. Line pie plate with paste ; put in cranberry jam ; wash the 
edges, lay three narrow bars across; fasten at edge, then three more 
across, forming diamond-shaped spaces. Lay rim of paste; wash with 
egg wash ; bake in quick oven until paste is cooked.

Apple Dumplings 

Chop one pound suet very fine. Add a little salt and Sperry flour 
enough to make a dough, then wet up with cold water. Knead this as lit- 
tle as possible — only enough to roll out and cut. Pare, core and quarter 
tart apples. Cover each apple with dough, pressing it together so it will 
not burst open and wrap white cloth about it, first wetting the cloth in 
hot water. Pin each dumpling tightly up and drop it into boiling water. 
Do not let them cease boiling until done. An hour's time is ample. Eat 
with sweet sauce or butter and sugar. 

Peach Cobbler 

Fill a shallow pudding dish or deep earthen pie plate with ripe, 
peeled peaches, leaving in the pits to increase the flavor of the fruit. 
Add cold water to half "fill the dish and cover the whole with a light paste 
rolled to twice the thickness used for pies. Cut slits across the middle, 
prick with a fork and bake in a slow oven about three-fourths of an hour. 
The peaches should be sugared before putting on the crust. Serve either 
warm or cold ; the crust should be inverted after being cut into sections 
and the peaches piled upon it. To be eaten with sweet cream. 




46 



To Fry Fish 

After the fish is well cleansed, lay it on a folded towel and dry out 
all the water; when well wiped and dry, roll it in wheat flour, rolled 
crackers, grated stale bread or Indian meal, whichever may be preferred ; 
wheat flour will generally be liked. Have a thick-bottomed frying-pan 
with plenty of sweet lard salted (a tablespoonful of salt to each pound of 
lard) for fresh fish which have not been previously salted ; let it become 
boiling hot, then lay the fish in and let it fry gently until one side is a 
fine, delicate brown, then turn the other; when both are done take it up 
carefully and serve quickly, or keep it covered with a tin cover, and set 
the dish where it will keep hot. 

To Broil Fish 

Rub the bars of your gridiron with dripping or a piece of beef suet, 
to prevent the fish from sticking. Put a good piece of butter into a dish, 
enough salt and pepper to season the fish. Lay the fish on it when it is 
broiled, and with a knife put the butter over every part. Serve very hot. 

To Bake Fish Whole 

Cut off the head and split the fish down nearly to the tail ; prepare a 
dressing of bread, butter, pepper and salt, moisten with a little water. 
Fill the dish with this dressing, and bind it together with a piece of 
string; lay the fish on a bake-pan and pour round it a little water and 
melted butter. Baste frequently. A good-sized fish will bake in an hour. 
Serve with the gravy of the fish, drawn butter. 

Broiled Salt Mackerel 

Freshen by soaking it over night in water, being careful that the skin 
lies uppermost. In the morning dry it without breaking, cut off the 
head and tip of the tail, place it between the bars of a buttered fish- 
gridiron, and broil to a light brown ; lay it on a hot dish, and dress with 
a little butter, pepper, and lemon juice, vinegar, or chopped pickle. 



Fried Bass With Bacon 

Carefully clean the required number of bass, season well with pepper 
and salt, roll in Sperry flour, then drop into a pan of very hot lard or oil 
and fry to a golden brown. Fry in a separate pan some bacon ; one piece 
for each piece of fish, and lay on the fish. Garnish with parsley. 

Broiled Salmon 

Cut six slices from the salmon, sprinkle them with salt and pepper, 
dip in beaten eggs and bread-crumbs. Place them in a saucepan and 
cook both sides quickly. Drain and lay them in a dish. Garnish them 
with a few pieces of lemon dipped in parsley chopped fine and some eggs 
fried in oil.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Boiled Salmon 

Sew as many pounds as desired up in a cheese-cloth bag, and boil 
for a quarter of an hour to the pound, in slightly salted water. When 
done, take out and lay upon a dish, being careful not to break the fish. 
Prepare a small cupful of drawn butter, in which had been stirred a tea- 
spoonful of minced parsley and the juice of one-fourth of a lemon. Pour 
over the salmon and serve. Garnish with parsley. The choicest portion 
of the salmon is that at the center and toward the tail. 



Boiled Halibut 

Purchase a thick slice cut through the body, or the tail piece, 
which is considered the richest. Wrap it in a floured cloth and lay it in 
warm water with salt in it. A piece weighing six pounds should be 
cooked in half an hour after the water begins to boil. Melted butter and 
parsley are eaten with it. If any is left, lay it in a deep dish and sprinkle 
on it a little salt, throw over it twelve cloves, pour in some vinegar, and 
it will, when cold, have much the flavor of lobster. 



Baked Bass 

Make a filling of pounded cracker or crumbs of bread, an egg, pepper, 
clove, salt and butter. Fill it very full, and when sewed up, grate over 
it a small nutmeg and sprinkle it with pounded cracker. Then pour on 
the white of one egg, and a little melted butter. Bake it an hour in the 
same dish in which it is to be served. 



Baked Bass — No. 2 

Select a choice bass, weighing about four pounds ; season with salt 
and pepper and roll in flour. Place in roasting pan with a good slice of 
butter, three tablespoonfuls of catsup, two tablespoonfuls Worcestershire 
sauce, one small onion and a clove of garlic. Bake four minutes and add 
the juice of fifteen cents' worth of California oysters and a little water, 
if necessary, to make enough gravy. Ten minutes before serving, add a 
wine glass of white wine and 10 cents' worth of picked shrimps; just 
before removing from the oven add the 15 cents' worth of oysters and 
let cook up once. 

Fried Finnan Haddies 

Rub oil on both sides of the fish, and set it in a frying-pan, with 
plenty of butter. Shake the pan over a clear fire. Three minutes will 
cook it. Then rub a little butter over it and send to table. 



Fish Cutlets 

Season with salt and pepper one pint of any kind of cold cooked fish; 
make a little thick cream sauce of milk, butter and Sperry flour, and when 
cold mold it with the fish into shapes of cutlets. Put the cutlets first into 
cracker crumbs, then into egg and again into crumbs. Fry in hot fat 
until brown.

water. Stand on the stove, cover the fish with one and one-half pints of 
milk and a large tablespoonful of butter. Stir into a cup of cold cream 
two heaping tablespoonfuls of flour and when the milk on the stove is 
about to boil mix this with it. When the mixture has thickened stand 
where it will boil no longer and stir into it one egg. Serve at once. 

Fish Chowder 

Two pounds of fresh white fish, a quarter of a pound of bacon, 
five small potatoes, one small onion, six tomatoes, one quart of milk, 
butter the size of a small hen's eggs and a teaspoon Sperry flour. Pick the 
fish to pieces. Remove the bone and skin ; cut potatoes into small 
squares ; the bacon in small pieces ; rub the butter and flour to a cream. 
I Spread in a granite kettle half of the potatoes, then half of the fish, then 
sprinkle in the minced onions, then the bacon, then half the tomatoes. 
Then a shake of salt and pepper ; add the rest of the fish, tomatoes, pota-. 
toes, and more salt and pepper, using in all one teaspoon of salt and one- 
fourth teaspoon of pepper. Cover with water, let simmer for half an hour. 
Scald the milk, put a pinch of soda into the chowder and stir ; add the hot 
milk to the butter and flour ; stir smooth ; then add to the chowder. Serve 
very hot. 

Fish Balls 

The remnants of any cold fish can be used by breaking the fish to 
pieces with a fork, removing all the bones and skin, and shredding very 
fine. Add an equal quantity of mashed potatoes, make into a stiff batter 
with a piece of butter and some milk, and a beaten egg. Flour your hands 
and shape the mixture into balls. Fry in boiling lard or drippings, to a 
light brown. 

Fish Croquettes 

Take remnants of boiled cod, salmon or halibut and pick the flesh 
out carefully. Mince it moderately fine. Stir a piece of butter, a small 
spoon Sperry flour and some milk over fire until they thicken. Then add 
pepper, salt and a little grated nutmeg, together with finely-chopped 
parsley, and then the minced fish. When very hot remove from the fire, 
turn on a dish to get cold, then shape and finish the croquettes.

Roll each fish in a mixture of mustard, Worcestershire sauce, 
anchovy sauce and a little melted butter. Lay each on a slice of toast in 
a hot oven for five minutes. Serve immediately. (The "Mustard" 
Sardines are easiest prepared this way, as the mustard sauce in which 
they are packed can be utilized). 

Sardine Rolls 

Make a nice rich pie crust, cut in four-inch squares. Put one of 
Booth's Soused Sardines in center of each square. Roll up and close ends 
by pinching. Bake quickly as you would pie. Garnish platter with lettuce 
leaves. This makes a delicious luncheon dish. 

Sardine Rarebit 

One can of Booth's Sardines, drain off juice and wipe each fish. Put 
each fish on toaster and brown. Also toast some narrow strips of bread, 
upon which put the fish, and then place in oven to keep warm while the 
sauce is being made. 

SAUCE — Melt one tablespoonful of butter and add two tablespoon- 
fuls of grated cheese, stir until cheese is melted, add gradually the beaten 
yolk of an egg mixed with one-fourth cup of cream. Stir until smooth and 
thick, and add l / 2 teaspoonful of salt and l / 2 teaspoonful of tobasco sauce. 
Pour this over the sardines, a few spoonfuls to each fish. Serve with 
sliced lemon.

HOW TO SELECT POULTRY 

In selecting- poultry full-grown fowls have the best flavor, provided 
they are young. The age may be determined by turning the wing 
backward — if it yields, it is tender. The same is true if the skin on 
the leg is readily broken. Older poultry makes the best soup. The 
intestines should be removed at once, but frequently in shipping they are 
left in and, hence, when removed, the fowl needs washing in several 
waters. The next to the last water should contain a half teaspoonful of 
baking soda, which sweetens and renders all more wholesome. The 
giblets are the gizzard, heart, liver and neck. 



Roast Turkey 

Carefully pluck the bird and singe off the down with lighted 
paper ; break the leg bone close to the foot, hang up the bird and draw 
out the strings of the thigh. Never cut the breast ; make a small slit 
down the back of the neck and take out the crop that way, then cut the 
neck bone close, and after the bird is stuffed the skin can be turned over 
the back and the crop will look full and round. Cut around the vent, 
making the hole as small as possible, and draw carefully, taking care that 
the gall bag and the intestine joining the gizzard are not broken. Open 
the gizzard, take out the contents and detach the liver from the gall 
bladder. The liver, gizzard and heart, if used in the gravy, will need 
to be boiled an hour and a half and chopped as fine as possible. Wash the 
turkey and wipe thoroughly dry, inside and out ; then fill the inside with 
stuffing, and sew the skin of the neck over the back. Sew up the opening 
at the vent, then run a long skewer into the pinion and thigh through 
the body, passing it through the opposite pinion and thigh. Put a 
skewer in the small part of the leg, close on the outside and push it 
through. Pass a string over the points of the skewers and tie it securely 
at the back. 

Sprinkle well with Sperry flour, cover the breast with nicely-buttered 
white paper, place on a grating in the dripping-pan and put in the oven 
to roast. Baste every fifteen minutes — a few times with butter and water, 
and then with the gravy in the dripping-pan. Do not have too hot an 
oven. A turkey weighing ten pounds will require three hours to bake. 



Roast Goose 

Get a goose that is not more than eight months old, and the fatter 
it is the more juicy the meat. The dressing should be made of three 
pints of bread crumbs, six ounces of butter, a teaspoonful each of sage, 
black pepper and salt, and a finely chopped onion. Do not stuff very 
full, but sew very closely so that the fat will not get in. Place in a 
baking pan with a little water, and baste often with a little salt, water and 

60 



BRIDE'S COOK BO( >K 

vinegar. Turn the goose frequently so that it may be evenly browned. 
Bake about two and one-half hours. When done/take it from the pan, 
drain off the fat and add the chopped giblets, which have previously been 
boiled tender, together with the water in which they were done. Thicken 
with flour and butter rubbed together; let boil, and serve 

Baked Chicken 

Take a plump chicken, dress and lay in cold salt water for one-half 
hour, then put in pan, stuff and sprinkle well with salt and pepper; lay 
;a few slices of fat pork on to keep moist. Cover and bake until tender, 
with a steady fire. Baste often. Turn so as to have uniform heat. 
i 

Boiled Chicken 

Clean, wash and stuff as for roasting. Baste a floured cloth around 
each, and put into a pot with enough boiling water to cover them well. 
The hot water cooks the skin at once, and prevents the escape of the 
juices. The broth will not be so rich as if the fowls are put on in cold 
water, but this is proof that the meat will be more nutritious and better 
flavored. Stew very slowly, for the first half hour especially. Boil an 
hour or more, guiding yourself by size and toughness. Serve with egg or 
bread sauce. 

Chicken Fricassee 



Clean and disjoint chicken. Wipe each piece. Put in pot, cover with 
boiling water and simmer till tender. To the liquor add one cup or more 
hot milk, thicken with Sperry flour dissolved in cold water. Season well, 
oil up for a few minutes. Serve with dumplings or biscuit. 

Fried Chicken 



b 



A chicken for frying should be very young, but if there are doubts as 
to its age, before cutting it up parboil it for ten minutes in water that has 
Jbeen slightly salted. Then sprinkle a little salt and pepper over the pieces 
and roll them in Sperry flour. Fry in plenty of butter till done. It takes 
twenty minutes to fry them. Put the chicken on a platter, make a gravy 
by turning off some of the fat and adding a cup of milk that has been 
thickened with a tablespoon of flour. Pour this gravy over it. Or the 
a^ravy can be omitted and the platter can be garnished with crisp lettuce 
leaves. 

Chicken Croquettes 

Take any kind of cold fowl, cut up fine, season with salt, pepper and 
>utter, a little onion if desired and stir in two fresh eggs. Make in cakes, 
lip in beaten egg, then in cracker crumbs and fry in boiling lard or lard 
md butter mixed. 

Fried Spring Chicken 

Clean and disjoint, then soak in salt water for about two hours. Put 
'in frying pan equal parts of lard and butter, in all enough to cover 
chicken. Roll each piece in flour, dip in beaten egg, then roll in cracker 
crumbs, and drop into the boiling fat. Fry until browned on both sides. 
perve on flat platter garnished with sprigs of parsley. Pour most of the 
Vat from frying pan, thicken the remainder with browned flour, add to it 
cup of boiling water or milk. Serve in gravy bowl.

starch with two level tablespoonfuls flour, add four tablespoonfuls cream, 
and three cups hot chicken stock, stir till it thickens. Pour over chicken 
and cover with crust. Sift into mixing bowl one cup Sperry flour, one- 
quarter cup of corn starch, two and one-half level teaspoonfuls baking 
powder, one-quarter teaspoonful salt ; rub in finely one tablespoonful each 
of butter and lard. Add milk to make dough as soft as may be handled. 
Roll out little larger than top of dish, so that crust may be placed on 
loosely. Pierce small openings in crust, and bake until crust is well done. 
Send to table in baking dish. 



Boiled Chicken— Royal Style 

Truss chicken and tie strips of bacon over the breast. Put into a 
kettle, cover with boiling water, season with salt and pepper, cover close 
and cook slowly until tender. Remove from water, drain, rub with 
mixture of creamed butter and flour and brown in the oven. Cool the 
liquor quickly and remove the fat, then reheat. To each pint of liquor 
allow one rounding tablespoonful corn starch. Blend the corn starch 
in a little cold water, pour into the hot liquor and boil ten minutes. 
Then add one-half cup chopped mushrooms. When gravy is perfectly 
done, remove fcom fire, and to one pint of gravy add yolk of one egg, 
slightly beaten. Do not cook again after the yolk has been added, or it 
may curdle. Serve gravy in boat. 



Broiled Chicken 

Singe, split down backbone, and clean. Grease broiler, place chicken 
on it, crossing legs and turning wings. Rub inside and out with soft 
butter, and season. Have fire clear and hot. Cook flesh side first, holding 
up well that it may not brown too quickly. Should cook in about twenty 
or twenty-five minutes, then turn and brown skin side. 



Chicken a la Creole 

Cut a boiled chicken into cubes of an inch. Put a tablespoonful of 
butter and one of grated onion in a frying pan, add half a cupful of tomato 
and three sweet peppers cut into strips. Add the chicken, a teaspoon- 
ful of salt and a dash of red pepper. Cover the dish and when hot, serve. 

Cream Chicken 

Boil a four pound chicken and four sweetbreads and set aside to 
cool. When cold cut in small pieces. In the meantime, or when ready to 
serve, put in double boiler five tablespoonfuls Sperry flour, four of butter 
and stir together. Then slowly add, stirring all the time, a quart of rich 
cream. Season with salt, black pepper, a dash of cayenne pepper and a 
few drops of tabasco. Into this stir the chicken and sweetbreads and one 
can of mushrooms cut in half ; heat thoroughly and serve in patty cases.

Chicken — Southern Style 

Wash your chicken thoroughly in soda and water. Dry and dis- 
joint. Put one and one-half cups of cold water in a porcelain pot (Dutch 
oven preferred) ; pack chicken in closely. Mince two small onions, one 
kernel garlic, little parsley and sprinkle over chicken. Cover closely and 
let simmer three hours. Half an hour before it is done season with salt 
and pepper. Do not lift the cover during the cooking. When done 
remove chicken and thicken gravy with a little Sperry flour. 

Wild Ducks 

Nearly all wild ducks are liable to have a fishy flavor, and when 
handled by inexperienced cooks, are sometimes uneatable from this cause. 
Before roasting them guard against this by parboiling them with a small 
carrot, peeled, put within each. This will absorb the unpleasant taste. 
An onion will have the same effect; but unless you mean to use onion in 
the stuffing, the carrot is preferable. 

Roast Wild Duck 

Parboil as above directed; throw away the carrot or onion, lay in 
fresh water half an hour; stuff with bread crumbs seasoned with pepper, 
salt, sage and onion, and roast until brown and tender, basting for half 
the time, with butter and water, then with drippings. Add to the gravy, 
when you have taken up the ducks, a teaspoonful of currant jelly and a 
pinch of cayenne. Thicken with browned flour and serve in a tureen. 

Pigeon Pie 

Clean and truss three of four pigeons, rub the outside and in with a 
mixture of pepper and salt ; rub the inside with a bit of butter, and fill it 
with a bread-and-butter stuffing, or mashed potatoes ; sew up the slit, 
butter the sides of a tin basin or pudding dish, and line (the sides only) 
>with pie paste, rolled to quarter of an inch thickness; lay the birds in; 
for three large tame pigeons, cut quarter of a pound of sweet butter and 
put it over them, strew over a large teaspoonful of salt and a small 
teaspoonful of pepper, with a bunch of finely cut parsley, if liked ; dredge 
a large teaspoonful of wheat flour over ; put in water to nearly fill the pie ; 
lay skewers across the top, cover with a puff paste crust; cut a slit in the 
middle, ornament the edge with leaves, braids, or shells of paste, and put 
jin a moderately hot or quick oven for one hour ; when nearly done, brush 
Ithe top over with the yolk of an egg beaten with a little milk, and finish. 
'The pigeons for this pie may be cut in two or more pieces, if preferred. 
jAny small birds may be done in this manner. 

Roast Pigeon 

Clean and truss two young pigeons, mince the livers, and mix with 

'them two ounces of finely grated bread crumbs, two ounces of fresh 

'butter, an onion finely chopped, a teaspoonful of shredded parsley, and a

fasten a slice of fat bacon over the breast of each, and roast. Make a 

sauce by mixing a little water with the gravy which drops from the birds, 

md boiling it with a little thickening; season it with pepper, salt and

Quail on Toast 

Take five quail, but don't remove the legs, for you would lose all the 
taste of the game. Wipe them well ; string them tight, so as to raise the 
breasts. Put a little butter on each, a little lemon juice, and inside each 
the quarter of a lemon without the peel. Then put a very thin slice of 
pork, about two inches square, around each quail, with two or three cuts 
in each side, and string it tight. Let cook on a good fire, and when they 
are nearly well done, for white meat game must be well done, cut the 
strings; dress nicely on toast and serve hot. Pour the juice on the quail 
after having taken the fat off, and put some slices of lemon around the 
dish, one for each quail. 

Rabbit Pie 

Cut a rabbit into seven pieces, soak in salted water one-half hour and 
stew until half done in enough water to cover it. Lay slices of pork in 
the bottom of a pie dish and upon these a layer of rabbit. Then follow 
slices of hard-boiled Qgg, peppered and buttered. Continue until the dish 
is full, the top layer being bacon. Pour in the water in which the rabbit 
was stewed, and adding a little Sperry flour, cover with puff paste, cut a 
slit in the middle and bake one hour, laying paper over the top should 
it brown too fast. 

Roast Tame Duck 

Take a young farmyard duck fattened at liberty, but cleansed by 
being shut up two or three days and fed on barley meal and water. Pluck, 
singe and empty ; scald the feet, skin and twist round on the back of the 
bird ; head, neck and pinions must be cut off, the latter at the first joint, 
and all skewered firmly to give the breast a nice plump appearance. For 
stuffing, take one-half pound of onions, a teaspoonful of powdered sage, 
three tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, the liver of duck parboiled and 
minced with pepper, salt and cayenne. Cut the onions very fine, throw- 
ing boiling water over them, and cover for ten minutes ; drain through a 
gravy strainer, and add the bread crumbs, minced liver, sage, pepper 
and salt to taste ; mix, and put inside the duck. This amount is for one 
duck ; more onion and more sage may be added, but the above is a deli- 
cate compound not likely to disagree with the stomach. Let the duck 
be hung a day or two, according to the weather, to make the flesh tender. 
Roast before a brisk, clear fire, baste often, and dredge with flour to 
make the bird look frothy. Serve with a good brown gravy in the dish, 
and apple sauce in a tureen. It takes about an hour. 

Venison Steak Broiled 

Take the leg and cut slices from it, having a quick, clear fire. Turn 
them constantly. They should be served underdone. Butter both sides 
of the steak ; sprinkle salt and pepper over the venison, garnish with 
parsley and accompany it by a jelly sauce. 

Roast Venison 

Slit the venison and lard it with pieces of pork or bacon. Place 
pieces of pork or bacon on the bottom of the pan ; slice very fine, vege- 
tables on the bacon, then place your meat on this. Season, brown well 
on the top of the stove, then turn over and brown on the other side

Consomme or Plain Meat Stock for Soup 

Consomme or stock forms the basis of all meat soups, gravies and 
purees. The simpler it is made, the longer it keeps. It is best made of 
fresh uncooked beef and some broken bones, to which may be added the 
remnants of broken meats. In a home where meat forms part of the 
every-day diet, a good cook will seldom be without a stock-pot. 

Four pounds of beef and broken bones, one gallon of cold water and 
two teaspoonfuls of salt. Put the meat and water on the back of the 
stove and let it slowly come to a boil, then simmer three or four hours, 
until the water is boiled away one-half; add the salt, strain and sei ro 
cool, in an earthenware dish well covered. When cold, take off the fat 
from the top and it is ready for use. To make soup for a family of six, 
take one-quarter of the stock, to which add one quart of boiling water, 
and any vegetables desired — boil three hours. Season with salt and 
pepper. 

Mixed Stock for Soups 

To six pounds of lean beef, with the bones well cracked, add six 
quarts of water. Put the beef, bones and water in a covered kettle 
on the stove to heat slowly. Let it boil gently for six hours. After it 
has boiled for six hours, strain and set aside well covered until the next 
day. Before needed, remove the fat, set the soup over the fire and put 
in a little salt, two carrots, two onions, one turnip, one head of celery. 
Stew in sufficient water to cover them. When tender, add the vegetables 
and the water in which they were cooked, to the soup. Boil slowly for 
one-half hour. Strain when done. A bay leaf added to the stock before 
cooking the second day. adds greatly to the flavor. 

Egg Balls for Soup 

Rub the yolks of four hard boiled eggs with a little melted butter, 
to a paste. Add a little pepper and salt. Beat two raw eggs and add to 
above, with enough Sperry flour to make them hold together. Make into 
balls, put in the soup and let boil one minute. 

Noodles for Soup 

Take two eggs, butter the size of a walnut, three tablespoons sour 
cream, sufficient Sperry flour to make a rather stiff dough; knead, roll 
out very thin and cut in narrow strips ; cook half hour or less. 

Croutons 

To make croutons to serve with soups, cut bread in slices one- 
quarter of an inch thick, remove crust and cut in squares. If to be 
browned in the oven, butter lightly before cutting in squares; put on bak- 
ing sheet, dry thoroughly and brown delicately. Should be crisp cubes 
when done. May be fried in deep fat.

an hour. Add three ounces of washed rice, with a turnip and some celery. 
Simmer for two hours. Strain, free from fat and salt. 



Beef Tea 

Take two pounds of lean rump beef, remove all fat, cut into small 
pieces and place in a tightly corked bottle. Place the bottle in a deep

Put two pounds of shin beef in one gallon of water. Add a teacup 
jof pearl barley, three large onions cut up fine, a small bunch of parsley 
(minced, three potatoes sliced, a little thyme, and pepper and salt to 
taste. Simmer steadily three hours, and stir often, so that the meat will 
Jnot burn. Do not let it boil. Always stir soup or broth with a wooden 
ispoon. 

Turkey Soup 

Place the remains of a cold turkey and what is left of the dressing 
and gravy in a pot, and cover it with cold water. Simmer slowly four 
ihours, and let stand until the next day. Take off what fat may have 
jarisen, and take out with a skimmer all the bits of bones. Put the soup 
ion to heat until at boiling point, then thicken slightly with flour stirred 
into a cup of cream, and season to taste. Pick off all the meat from bones,

SALADS 

Ideas in Salads 

Prepare celery stalks very carefully by removing the stringy fiber 
until entirely free from shreds. Chop quite fine, and to two cupfuls of 
celery add two cupfuls of chopped lettuce, the latter crisp and fresh as 
possible. Season with salt, pepper, vinegar, pure olive oil, bay leaf and 
thyme or savory. If possible, add half a teaspoonful of shoyu, or Jap- 

70 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

anese sauce, which greatly improves the flavor. Mix all thoroughly and 
then add crab, shrimp, sardine, spiced mackerel or halibut filling. Boiled 
halibut, chilled in salt water, makes a good combination with crab, and 
when broken into small portions and allowed to stand for an hour or so, in 
the same salt water with crab, can with difficulty be distinguished from 
the crab itself. For sardine, potato and meat salads, a tablespoonful of 
onion juice is desirable. 

Make a mayonnaise dressing by using the yolks of three or four 
eggs, according to the quantity desired, and after beating add, drop by 
drop, pure olive oil, stirring constantly until the mixture begins to 
thicken. Then a larger quantity of oil may be stirred in until the mixture 
becomes of proper consistency, about like heavy cream ; do not season 
until thickened for fear of curdling. Salt very sparingly, and if desired 
sift in a little cayenne pepper, a few drops of lemon or vinegar, or one or 
. two teaspoonfuls of spiced mustard vinegar from mustard pickles. 

i 

Mayonnaise Dressing 

Put the yolk of an egg into a cup with a salt-spoonful of salt, and 
beat until light ; then add one-half teaspoonful of dry mustard and beat 
again. Then add olive oil, drop by drop, then a few drops of vinegar and 
the same of lemon juice. Continue this process until the egg has absorbed 
a little more than a half a teacup of oil ; finish by adding a very little 
i cayenne pepper and sugar. 

French Dressing 

Mix quarter teaspoonful salt, dash white pepper and three table- 
spoons olive oil. Stir for few minutes, then gradually add one table- 
spoon vinegar, stirring rapidly until mixture is slightly thickened and 
vinegar cannot be noticed. Mixture will separate in about twenty 
minutes. 

Chicken Salad

before boiling. Thin with milk when you wish to use it. This dressing 
will keep two or three days. 




73 



Broiling 

The rules for roasting- meat apply to broiling, except that instead 
of cooking it in the oven it is to be quickly browned, first on one side 
and then on the other, over a hot fire, and removed a little from the fire 
to finish cooking. Meat an inch thick will broil in about four minutes. 
Season after it is cooked. 

Frying 

There are two methods of frying: One with very little fat in the 
pan, to practice which successfully the pan and the fat must be hot 
before the article to be fried is put into it. For instance, in frying chops, 
if the pan is hot, and only fat enough is used to keep the chops from 
sticking to it, the heat being maintained so that the chops cook quickly, 
they will be nearly as nice as if they were broiled. Frying by the other 
method consists in entirely covering the article to be cooked in smoking- 
hot fat, and keeping the fat at that degree of heat until the food is brown. 
It should then be taken up with a skimmer and laid upon brown paper for 
a moment to free it from grease. 



Boiling and Stewing 

Fresh meat for boiling should be put into boiling water and boiled 
very gently about twenty minutes for each pound. A little salt, spice or 
vegetables may be boiled in the water with the meat for seasoning. A 
little vinegar put in the water with tough meat makes it tender. The 
broth of boiled meat should always be saved to use in soups, stews and 
gravies. Stewing and simmering meats means to place them near 
enough to the fire to keep the water on them bubbling moderately, 
constantly and slowly. Salt meats should be put over the fire in cold 
water, which, as soon as it boils, should be replaced by fresh cold water, 
the water to be changed until it remains fresh enough to give the meat a 
palatable flavor when done. Salted and smoked meats require about 30 
minutes' very slow boiling, from the time the water boils, to each pound. 
Vegetables and herbs may be boiled with them to flavor them. When 
they are cooked the vessel containing them should be set where they 
will keep hot without boiling until wanted, if they are to be served 
hot ; if they are to be served cold, they should be allowed to cool in the 
pot liquor in which they were boiled. Very salt meats, or those much 
dried in smoking, should be soaked over night in cold water before 
boiling. 

Roasting 

Wipe the meat with damp cloth. Trim and tie into shape, if neces- 
sary. In the bottom of pan put some pieces of fat from meat. Arrange 
meat on rack in pan. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and flour. Have oven 
very hot at first; when meat is half done reduce heat. Baste every ten 

74 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

or fifteen minutes. If there is danger of fat in pan being scorched, add 
a few spoons of boiling water. Allow from ten to twenty minutes per 
pound of meat, according as it is desired, rare or well done. When done 
remove to hot plate. Thicken gravy in pan with browned flour, adding 
more water as necessary and add seasoning. An onion may be laid on 
top of the roast to give it flavor, but should be removed before serving. 

In purchasing meat one should know how to select the best quality, 
and the most useful pieces. 

Beef, which stands at the head of the list, as being most generally 
used and liked, should be of a bright, clear red, and fat white. It should 
be well clothed in fat, to insure its being tender and juicy.. The finest 
pieces are the sirloin and the ribs — the latter making the best roasting 
piece in the animal. 

In cooking" steaks, remember it is far better to turn over three or 
four times on a platter containing a little olive oil than it is to hammer 
them, to make them tender. The object is not to force out the juice, but 
to soften the fiber. 

In selecting pork, one cannot exercise too great care in examining 
it. Do not buy any that is clammy or has kernels in the fat. Remember, 
! too, when the rind is hard it is old. 

Veal should be fine in grain, of a delicate pink, with plenty of kidney 
fat. It should never be eaten under two months old. 

Mutton should be firm and juicy, the flesh close-grained, the fat hard 
• and white. 

To Clarify Drippings 

Drippings accumulated from different cooked meats (except mutton, 

, which has a strong flavor), can be clarified by putting all into a basin 

and slicing into it a raw potato, allowing it to boil long enough for the 

potato to brown, which causes all impurities to disappear. Remove from 

1 the fire, and. when cool drain into basin and set in a cool place. 



BEEF 



Hint on Cooking Roast Beef 

For roast beef to be juicy and tender when done, it should be basted 
every few minutes, so in order to save yourself this trouble, place a large 
piece of beef suet on top of the roast ; have baking pan perfectly dry 
and oven very hot ; place in the oven and let cook the allotted time — 
say half an hour, according to the size. You can go about your inside 
work and in the allotted time your roast is done to a beautiful brown 
and is very juicy, as it has been constantly basting itself all the while 
with the suet. Take roast out of pan, pour off drippings in a bowl and 
| make a gravy on top of stove. A nice addition to this is to put half 
dozen or so of peeled potatoes in the pan with roast when placing it in 
to cook, and they will be done to a nicety when the roast is. On taking 
up roast lay baked potatoes around same. This was an experiment and 
proved very successful, and saves a great deal of work and worry.

Lift out the meat, let the cabbage boil a few moments longer in the beef 
broth and send it to the table. 

Hot Beef Loaf 

Take three pounds of steak from the round and grind it through 
the meat chopper. Add two beaten eggs, pepper and salt, and one and 
one-half cupfuls of fresh, soft bread crumbs. Press this into a shallow, 
oblong, tin loaf-shaped pan and cover with about eight slices of salt 
pork, cut thin. Add one-half cupful of water to the pan, bake an hour, 
basting often, then put it on a warm platter, removing pieces of pork. 
Thicken the gravy in the pan with a little Sperry flour, and one-half can- 
ful of stewed mushrooms ; pour over and around the meat and serve hot. 
It is good when cold if cut in slices and served with lettuce salad. 

Creamed Dried Beef

pieces, or as much as will half fill a granite baking pan ; also any gravy 
that you have saved, a lump of butter, a bit of sliced onion, pepper and 
salt, and enough water to make plenty of gravy; put over a fire, thicken 
by dredging in a tablespoonful of Sperry flour; cover it up where it may 
stew gently. Now boil a sufficient quantity of potatoes to fill up your 
baking dish, mash smooth and beat light with milk and butter and place 
in a thick layer on top of meat. Brush it over with egg, place the dish 
in an oven and let remain long enough to become brown. There should 
be a goodly quantity of gravy left with the beef, that the dish be not dry 
and tasteless. 

Rolled Steak

Beef's Heart Stuffed 



After washing the heart thoroughly cut it into dice one-half inch 
long; put into a saucepan with water enough to cover. Remove scum. 
When nearly done add a sliced onion, a stalk of celery chopped fine, 
pepper and salt and a piece of butter. Stew until the meat is very tender. 
Stir up a tablespoonful of Sperry flour with a small quantity of water 
and thicken the whole. Boil up and serve. 

Beef Stewed With Onions 

Cut two pounds of tender beef into small pieces, season with pepper 
and salt ; slice one or two onions and add to it, with water enough to 
make a gravy. Let it stew slowly till the beef is thoroughly cooked, then 
add some pieces of butter rolled in Sperry flour, enough to make a rich 
gravy. Cold beef may be cooked in the same way, but the onions must 
then be cooked before adding them to the meat. Add more boiling water 
if it dries too fast. 

Beef Timbales 

Free left-over meat from fat and gristle, put through meat chopper, 
cutting finely. To one pint of meat add one teaspoon of salt, one-eighth 
teaspoon of pepper, put one-half cup of stock or water, two tablespoons 
of bread crumbs and one tablespoon of butter together in a saucepan over 
the simmering burner; when hot, add to it the meat; take from the fire 
and stir in carefully two whole eggs, well beaten. Put mixture in but- 
tered custard or timbale cups, stand in baking pan half filled with hot 
water. Bake in moderate oven fifteen to twenty minutes. Serve with 
tomato sauce.

lard in the bottom of pot, then the meat, and fill up with water till the 
meat is covered ; then take two onions, some pepper-corns, cloves, bay 
leaves, one carrot and a crust of brown bread, salt and some vinegar; 

78 



BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

put all this in over the beef, keep the pot well covered; fill up with more 
hot water if it boils down, and let it boil three hours; then burn a table- 
spoonful of Sperry flour, with some butter, a nice brown, thin with the 
gravy and let it boil up once more with the meat; then put the beef in 
a deep dish and strain the gravy over it ; add more vinegar to taste ; serve 
with fried potatoes and red cabbage. 

Braised Beef 

Wipe and trim six pounds round or rump of beef without bone. 

Sear brown on all sides in very hot frying-pan over hot fire. In braising 
, pan or iron kettle put layers of sliced onions, turnips and carrots, and 

some sweet herbs, one teaspoonful salt, one-half teaspoon pepper; on this 
. lay meat. Add one pint boiling water (or water and stewed tomatoes). 

Cover closely and cook four hour in moderate oven. If water evapor- 
. ates rapidly, add more. Put meat on hot platter. Strain, thicken and 
r season gravy. The vegetables may be served separately if desired. 

Corned Beef 

Should be cooked in plenty of cold water brought slowly to a boil ; if 
very salt, the meat should be soaked over night ; but if young and not 
too strongly brined this will not be necessary. It should be cooked long 
enough to make tender, so that in a brisket or plate piece the bones may 
be readily removed. Preserve the liquor in the pot, and if any of the 
meat remains after the first meal, return it and let it stand over night in 
the liquor, so that it may absorb it. If no meat remains to be returned to 
the liquor, the latter will make a good soup for next day's dinner, if the 
| beef was not too salt. 

Beef Steak Pie— French Style 

Take a nice piece of beef, rump or sirloin, cut in small slices; slice 
also a little, raw ham ; put both in a frying-pan, with some butter and 
small quantity chopped onions ; let them simmer together a short time 
on the fire or in the oven ; add a little Sperry flour and enough stock to 
make sauce ; salt, pepper, chopped parsley and a little Worcestershire 
sauce as a seasoning; add also some sliced potatoes, and cook together 
twenty minutes ; put this into a pie-dish, with a few slices of hard-boiled 
eggs on top, and cover with a layer of common paste. Bake from fifteen 
to twenty minutes in a well-heated oven. All dark-meat pie can be 
treated precisely in the same way. 

Spiced Beef 

Four pounds of round of beef chopped fine; take from it all fat; 
add to it three dozen small crackers rolled fine, four eggs, one cup of 
milk, one tablespoon ground mace, two tablespoons of black pepper, one 
tablespoon melted butter; mix well and put in any tin pan that it will 
just fill, packing it well ; baste with butter and water, and bake two hours 
in a slow oven. 

Roast Beef With Yorkshire Pudding 

Have your meat ready for roasting on Saturday, always. Roast upon 
a grating of several clean sticks (not pine) laid over the dripping pan. 
Dash a cup of boiling water over the beef when it goes into the oven ; 
baste often, and see that the fat does not scorch. About three-quarters 
of an hour before it is done, mix the pudding.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Yorkshire Pudding 

One pint of milk, four eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately, two 
cups of Sperry flour (prepared flour is best), one teaspoonful of salt. 
Use less Sperry flour if the batter grows too stiff. Mix quickly ; pour off 
the fat from the top of the gravy in the dripping pan, leaving just enough 
to prevent the pudding from sticking to the bottom. Pour in the batter 
and continue to roast the beef, letting the drippings fall upon the pudding 
below. The oven should be brisk by this time. Baste the meat with the 
gravy you have taken out to make room for the batter. In serving, cut 
the pudding into squares and lay about the meat in the dish. 

MUTTON AND LAMB 

Roast Mutton 

Get a leg of eight pounds, which has hung about a week, weather 
allowing. During hot weather this joint get quickly tainted. Rub it 
lightly with salt and put it at once before a brisk, sharp fire. Place it 
close to the fire for five minutes, then place it in the oven and let it 
roast slowly until done. Baste continually with good dripping until that 
from the joint begins to flow. When within twenty minutes of being 
done, sprinkle it with Sperry flour, and baste with butter or dripping; 
and when the froth rises, serve on a hot dish. Make a gravy, throw off 
the fat. when any gravy, if the dripping pan has been floured, will adhere 
to it. Add a little stock and a little boiling water, pepper and salt. Pour 
the gravy around the meat, not over it. 

Boiled Mutton or Lamb 

Trim and wipe the meat. Have ready kettle of rapidly boiling salted 
water. Immerse meat, boil hard five minutes, then reduce to gentle sim- 
mer. Allow fifteen minutes per pound. Lamb should always be well 
done; mutton may be rare. A little rice may be added to water to keep 
meat white. 

Mutton Pie 

A very good family pie is made with the remains of a cold leg, loin 
or any other joint of mutton from which neat slices of rather lean meat 
can be cut. These should be put with a good seasoning, in alternate 
layers with thin-sliced potatoes, into a pie-dish, commencing at the bot- 
tom with some of the meat, and finishing at the top with potatoes. 
Parsley, herbs or onion, with a little mace, white pepper and salt may 
be used at discretion. A cupful of good gravy from the meat should 
be poured into the pie before the crust is put on. Suet is generally used 
for the crust. 

Mutton Patties 

Mutton patties are made with cooked meat, which is minced, then 
hashed in good gravy, seasoned with pepper and salt, and a little catsup. 
The mince should not boil, but be made hot and thickened. Patty pans, 
lined with half paste and filled with meat, will require a very short 
time to bake. Cover with the paste, and put them into a quick oven for 
fifteen minutes.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Breaded Mutton 

Sew the mutton up in a thin cloth, lay it in a saucepan, nearly cover 
it with cold water and stew gently, allowing ten minutes to each pound. 
Take it out, unwrap and lay it in a baking dish, brush over with warm 
drippings, dredge with flour and set in the oven for one-half of an hour, 
basting freely with its own broth. A few minutes before taking it up 
strew thickly with crumbs, fine and dry, bits of butter over it, and brown. 

Mutton Haricot 

Cut two pounds breast mutton in pieces, roll in Sperry flour, brown 
in drippings. Transfer to stewpan, add two sliced onions, cover with 
boiling water and simmer until very tender. Add one pint parboiled po- 
tatoes or one pint boiled macaroni and one pint shelled peas ; season, 
simmer till vegetables are done. 

Lamb Sweetbreads 

Two or three sweetbreads, one-half pint of veal stock, white pepper 

and salt to taste, a small bunch of green onions, one blade of pounded 

mace, thickening of butter and flour, two eggs, nearly one-half pint of 

cream, one teaspoonful of minced parsley, a very little grated nutmeg. 

Mode — Soak the sweetbreads in luke-warm water, and put them into 

a saucepan with sufficient boiling water to cover them, and let them 

simmer for ten minutes ; then take them out and put them into cold water. 

Now lard them, lay them in a stewpan, add the stock, seasoning, onions, 

mace and a thickening of butter and Sperry flour, stew gently for one- 

| quarter of an hour or twenty minutes. Beat up the eggs with the cream, 

, to which add the minced parsley and very little grated nutmeg. Put this 

to the other ingredients ; stir it well till quite hot, but do not let it boil 

after the cream is added or it will curdle. Have ready some asparagus 

tops, boiled ; add these to the sweetbreads and serve. 

Lamb or Mutton Stew 
Part of a breast of mutton or lamb ; cut in bits as many potatoes, 
pepper and salt to taste, two onions, a bunch of parsley, a bunch of sweet 
herbs. Then stew all together in sufficient water to cover them for two 
hours, gently. Put in a teacupful of tomato catsup and boil up again. 
Serve hot. 

Broiled Mutton Chops 

Select one dozen chops cut from the loin ; trim, season with salt and 
pepper ; dip in melted butter and broil over a clear fire nearly ten minutes, 
turning frequently. Lay on warm platter and garnish with parsley. 

Irish Stew 
Cut two pounds of chops from the best end of a neck of mutton, and 

pare away all the fat. A portion of the breast may be cut into squares 
I and used, but a neck of mutton is the best joint for the purpose. Take as 

many potatoes as will amount, after paring, to twice the weight of the 

meat. Slice them with eight large onions, sliced. Put a layer of mixed 
[potatoes and onions at the bottom of a stewpan. Place the meat on 
[this and season it plentifully with pepper, and lightly with salt. Pack 
i closely and cover the meat with another layer of potato and onion. Pour 
I in as much water or stock as will moisten the topmost layer, cover the 
I stewpan tightly, and let its contents simmer gently for three hours. 

Don't remove lid, as this will let out the flavor.

Sweetbread Croquettes 

Wash and parboil one pair of sweetbreads, then put into cold water; 
remove outside skin and all membrane ; then with silver knife chop in 
small pieces and measure. There should be one-half of a pint of chopped 
meat. Put one-quarter pint of cream into a saucepan ; rub together one 
level teaspoonful of butter, a heaping teaspoonful of Sperry flour; stir 
into the hot cream until you have a smooth paste ; add the yolk of one 
egg and the sweetbreads ; mix and cook one minute, take from the fire 
and, if desired, add one dozen mushrooms chopped fine ; if fresh they 
must be cooked before chopping; add one tablespoonful of salt, one salt- 
spoonful of pepper, one teaspoonful of finely-chopped parsley, ten drops 
of onion juice; mix well. When cool form into croquettes; roll into 
beaten eggs, then roll in bread crumbs and fry in hot lard. 

Knuckle of Veal 

Cut in small thick slices, season with little salt and pepper, flour 
lightly and fry it to a pale brown, then lay it in a saucepan and cover 
with water. Skim well and season with thyme and parsley and a little 
mace. Simmer for two hours and a half, then thicken the gravy with a 
little Sperry flour and add a piece of butter, and salt to taste. 

Veal Pie 

Use the neck or any part of the veal which you prefer. Cook it by 
boiling an hour, then place the meat in a very deep dish, and when you 
lay on the upper crust wet the edge of the under crust all around and 
Hour it; then lay on the upper crust and press your hand upon the edge, 
so that the Sperry flour and water will make the crusts adhere and pre- 
vent the gravy from escaping. Stick the top several times with a large 
fork. If you have pieces of crust left, cut them into leaves and orna- 
ment the pie. Bake for about one-half hour. 

Veal Cutlets With Vermicelli — German Style 

Remove all the fat, but not the small rib of the cutlet, season and 
turn in egg and crumbs, or dip in melted butter, then in cheese mixed 
with an equal quantity of crumbs; let this absorb, then dip in the egg 
and again in the cheese mixture. Stand aside for two hours, then fry 
in plenty of butter the same as doughnuts. Meanwhile boil some vermi- 
celli in salt water until well done, then drain and mix with tomato sauce, 
arrange the vermicelli in the center of a chop platter and place the cut- 
lets around them. Serve hot. 

Veal Croquettes 

( hie pint minced cooked veal, half a pint of milk, two tablespoonfuls 
of Sperry flour, three tablespoonfuls of butter, one level tablespoonful 
of salt, one-third teaspoonful of pepper, one-half teaspoonful of onion 
juice, one teaspoonful of lemon juice. Put the milk in a saucepan. Beat 
the butter and Sperry flour together and stir in the milk as soon as it 
boils. When the sauce is smooth and thick add the seasoned meat and 
cook for three minutes. Beat three eggs together and pour half of them 
over the cooking meat. Take from the fire at once and stir well. Pour 
into a platter and set away to chill. When chilled make into cylindrical 
shapes and roll gently on board sprinkled with dried bread crumbs. Drop 
the croquettes in the beaten eggs and then in bread crumbs and fry.

Roast Loin of Veal 



Leave in the kidney, around which put considerable salt. Make a 
dressing the same as for fowls; unroll the loin, put the stuffing well 
around the kidney, fold and secure with several coils of white cotton 
twine wound around in all directions; place in a dripping pan, with the 
thick side down, and put in a rather hot oven, letting it cool down to 
moderate; in one-half hour add a little hot water to the pan, and baste 
often ; after half an hour turn over the roast and when done sprinkle 
lightly with Sperry flour and baste with melted butter. Before serving, 
carefully remove the twine. A roast of four or five pounds will bake in 
about two hours. For a gravy, skim off some of the fat if there is too 
much in the drippings ; dredge in Sperry flour ; stir until brown, add hot 
water if necessary ; boil a few minutes, stir in sweet herbs as fancied and 
put in a gravy boat. Serve with green peas and lemon jelly. 

Entree of Veal 

Take a piece of butter the size of an egg. three pounds of raw veal, 
one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of pepper and two eggs. Chop 
fine and mix together, adding two tablespoonfuls of water. Mold this 
into a loaf, then roll into two tablespoonfuls of pounded crackers and 
pour over it three tablespoonfuls of melted butter. Place in a pan and 
bake two hours. When cold, slice. 

Fried Sweetbreads 

For every mode of dressing they should be prepared by half boiling, 
and then putting them in cold water; this makes them whiter and firmer. 
| Dip in beaten egg and then in bread crumbs; pepper and salt and fry in 
lard. Serve with peas or tomatoes. 

Veal Cutlets, Breaded 

Trim and flatten the cutlets, pepper and salt, and roll in beaten egg, 
then in cracker crumbs. Fry rather slowly in good dripping, turning 
when the lower side is brown. Drain off the fat, squeeze a little lemon 
juice upon each, and serve in a hot flat dish. 

Calves Liver and Bacon 

Cut liver in one-half inch slices, soak in cold water twenty minutes, 
drain, dry and roll in Sperry flour. Have pan very hot. Put in bacon 
thinly sliced, turn until brown ; put on hot platter. Fry liver quickly 
in the hot fat, turning very often. When done, pour off all but one or 
two tablespoons fat, dredge in Sperry flour until it is absorbed, and stir 
till brown. Add hot water gradually to make smooth gravy, season and 
boil one minute. Serve separately. 

Veal Loaf 

Three pounds chopped veal, one pound fresh pork chopped nne, 
three well beaten eggs, butter size of an egg, one pint of bread crumbs, 
one tablespoon of salt, one teaspoonful of black pepper, half a teaspoonful 
of thyme, half a teaspoonful of sage. Make into loaf and take a piece of 
white muslin and wrap it securely around, also the ends. Place in a 
baking pan with very little water. Baste often. Turn so as to brown 
both sides. Leave in cloth until cold.

PORK 

To Roast a Leg of Pork 

Choose a small leg of fine young pork ; cut a slit in the knuckle with 
a sharp knife, and fill the space with sage and onions, chopped, and a 
little pepper and salt. When one-half done, score the skin in slices, 
but do not cut deeper than the outer rind. Apple sauce should be served 
with it. 

Salt Pork, Cream Gravy, Southern Style 

Cut sweet cured salt pork into half-inch slices, put into saucepan, 
cover with cold water and bring to boiling point. Drain off water, add 
cold water, stand a few minutes, then dry ; roll in Sperry flour, two parts, 
corn starch, one part, mixed and seasoned with white pepper. Have one 
tablespoonful hot bacon fat in frying-pan to prevent pork from sticking. 
Pour off fat as it melts while frying, brown and fry until reduced one- 
half. Measure fat. For one and one-half cups cream gravy allow three 
tablespoonfuls melted fat, add two level tablespoonfuls corn starch. 
Cook three minutes in the hot fat without browning, then add one and 
one-half cups milk, one-quarter teaspoonful salt, and cook until smoothly 
thickened. Serve for breakfast with baked potatoes and hot biscuit. 

Roast Spare-Rib 

Trim the ragged ends of a spare-rib neatly, crack the ribs across 
the middle, rub with salt and sprinkle with pepper. Fold it over, stuff 
with a turkey dressing, sew up tightly, place in dripping pan with a 
pint of water, baste often, turning it once or twice so as to bake both sides 
a rich brown. 

Saddle of Pork. Roasted 

Have your butcher cut a saddle of pork as he would a saddle of 
mutton. Strip off the skin, trim the joint neatly and cover the fat with 
buttered paper. Have a clear fire and baste often. One-half of an hour 
before it is taken up remove the paper, dredge the meat lightly with 
flour, and baste until it is brightly browned. ' Serve brown gravy and 
apple sauce or tomato sauce with it. If liked, the skin can be left on 
and it will then require to be scored lengthwise, the same way in which 
the saddle is carved. 

Fried Pork Chops 

Cut the chops about half an inch thick and trim them neatly; put a 
frying-pan on the fire, with a bit of butter ; so soon as it is hot, put in 
your chops, turning them often till brown all over ; a few minutes before 
they are done season with powdered sage, pepper and salt. 

Pork Tenderloins 

Tenderloins should be sliced crosswise and flattened, then fried or 
broiled, and seasoned with salt and pepper. If desired, when done, re- 
move to platter and make gravy by sprinkling a little flour into the hot 
fat ; if not enough add a little butter, stir until browned and add a little 
milk or cream, stir until it boils and pour over the dish.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Fried Salt Pork 

Take thin slices of pickled pork; fry lightly. Then mix a batter of 
egg and Sperry flour and milk and place the pork in this till is has be- 
come completely covered and fry to a light brown. 

Salt Pork 

Cut as many slices as needed ; if for breakfast, the night previously, 
and soak over night in a pint of milk and water, about one-half milk, 
either skimmed milk, sour milk or buttermilk; rinse till the water is 
clear, and roll in corn meal and fry. It is as nice as fresh pork. 

Fried Ham and Eggs 

Cut slices of ham very thin, trim off the rind, put into a frying-pan, 
cooking until crisp. Place on a hot platter; pour off some of the grease, 
then carefully break the eggs separately in a small plate so that no bad be 
cooked, and slip each egg gently into a frying-pan. Do not turn them 
while frying, but gently tip the pan so that the hot lard will be over them 
all. Cook about three minutes ; the white must retain its transparency so 
that the yolk can be seen through it. Lay a fried egg upon each slice of 
ham and serve hot. 

To Boil a Ham 

Well soak the ham in a large quantity of water for twenty-four 
hours, then trim and scrape it very clean, put it into a large pot with 
more than sufficient water to cover it ; put in a blade of mace, a few 
cloves, a sprig of thyme and two bay leaves. Boil it for four or five hours, 
according to its weight ; and when done, let it become cold in the liquor 
in which it was boiled. Then remove the rind carefully, without injuring 
the fat, press a cloth over it to absorb as much of the grease as possible, 
and shake some bread raspings over the fat. Serve cold, garnished with 
parsley. 

Roast Pig 

Select a pig about six weeks old, wash it thoroughly inside and out- 
side ; wipe dry with a towel, salt inside and stuff it with a rich fowl 
dressing, making it plump. Sew it up, place it in the dripping pan, salt 
and pepper the outside. Pour a little water into the dripping pan, baste 
with butter and water a few times as the pig warms, afterward with 
gravy from the dripping pan. Roast from two to three hours. Make 
the gravy by skimming off most of the grease ; stir in the pan a good 
tablespoonful of Sperry flour, turn in the water to make it the right thick- 
ness, season and let all boil up once. Strain and turn into the gravy 
dish. Place the pig upon a large platter surrounded with parsley. Send 
to the table hot. In carving, cut off the head first ; split the back, take 
off the hams and shoulders and separate the ribs. 

Baked Ham 

Put a medium-sized ham in a pot and cover with sweet cider. Let 
it simmer gently for three and one-half hours. Skim frequently to re- 
move the grease as it rises. When tender take out and remove the rind ; 
cut the fat on top into diamonds and in each diamond stick a clove ; then 
rub over the top of the ham one-half of a cupful of maple syrup, place in 
the oven and bake slowly for forty-five minutes.

BRIDE'S COOK BOOK 

Tortilla of Ham 

One-half of a pound of ham is to be cooked, then chopped and put 
with one tablespoonful of butter into a pan. Beat three eggs well and 
season. Pour them into the ham and stir for a minute, then let set, being 
careful that it does not adhere to the pan. When it is a little brown, turn 
and brown the other side. 

Pork Chops With Tomato Gravy 

Trim off skin and fat ; rub the chops over with a mixture of pow- 
dered sage and onion; put small pieces butter into frying-pan; put in the 
chops and cook slowly, as they should be well done. Place chops on 
hot dish; add a little hot water to gravy in pan, one large spoon butter 
rolled in Sperry flour, pepper, salt and sugar, and one-half cup juice 
drained from can tomatoes. Stew five minutes and pour over the chops 
and serve. 

Pork and Beans 

Soak one quart white beans over night in cold water. Drain, add 
fresh water and simmer gently till tender. Put in baking pan and place 
in center, rind up, gashed, one-half pound fat salt pork, parboiled. Mix 
one teaspoon salt, one-half teaspoon dry mustard and one tablespoon 
molasses; add this to the beans, with enough boiling water to cover. 
Bake eight hours in a moderate oven, adding more Water as necessary. 

SAUCES FOR MEATS, FISH, POULTRY OR VEGETABLES 

To Make Drawn Butter 

Put half a pint of milk in a perfectly clean stewpan, and set it over 
a moderate fire; put into a pint bowl a heaping tablespoonful of Sperry 
wheat flour, quarter of a pound of sweet butter, and a tablespoonful of 
salt ; work these well together with the back of a spoon, then pour into 
it, stirring it all the time, half a pint of boiling water; when it is smooth, 
stir it into the boiling milk, let it simmer for five minutes or more and 
it is done. 

Drawn butter made after this recipe will be found to be most ex- 
cellent ; it may be made less rich by using less butter. 

Parsley Sauce 

Make a drawn butter as directed, dip a bunch of parsley into boiling 
water, then cut it fine anl stir it into the drawn butter a few minutes 
before taking it up. 

Egg Sauce 

Make a drawn butter ; chop two hard boiled eggs quite fine the white 
and yolk seperately, and stir it into the sauce before serving. This is 
used for boiled fish or vegetables. 

Onion Sauce 

Peel some nice white onions, and boil them tender; press the water 
from them ; chop them fine and put them to a half pint of hot milk ; add 
a bit of butter and a teaspoonful of salt and pepper to taste. Serve with 
boiled veal or poultry or mutton.

Bread Sauce 

One pint milk, one cup bread crumbs (very fine), one onion, sliced, 
a pinch of mace, pepper and salt to taste, three tablespoonfuls butter. 
Simmer the sliced onion in the milk until tender; strain the milk and 
pour over the bread crumbs, which should be put into a saucepan. Cover 
and soak half an hour; beat smooth with an egg-whip, add the seasoning 
and butter; stir in well, boil up once and serve in a tureen. If it is too 
thick, add boiling water and more butter. 

This sauce is for roast poultry. Some people add some of the 
gravy from the dripping pan, first straining it and beating it well in 
with the sauce. 

Cucumber Sauce 

This is a good dressing for fish cutlets and fish fried in deep fat. 
Melt one tablespoonful butter in a saucepan, add one tablespoonful corn 
starch and one tablespoonful Sperry flour; mix, add three-quarters cup 
vinegar and quarter cup water. Cook till smooth, then add one teaspoonful 
salt, one teaspoonful sugar and one-quarter teaspoonful celery salt. Pour 
by tablespoonfuls the cooked mixture into four beaten yolks of eggs, 
return to boiler and stand over hot water. Do not cook, but beat till 
eggs are thickened, remove from water, add four tablespoonfuls olive 
oil, mix well and set to cool. Have ready one cup chopped fresh cucum- 
bers that have been soaked in ice cold unsalted water till crisp, drained 
dry as possible, and two small sweet midget pickles chopped finely. 
When ready to serve add little salt and paprika to drained cucumber 
and drain again. When dry, add cucumbers, fresh and pickled, to dress- 
ing. Beat well into dressing and serve cold with fish croquettes or 
similarly cooked fish dishes. May be served with fried oysters, if finely- 
cut crisp cabbage is substituted for the cucumbers. 

Brown Sauce 

In a saucepan, brown one tablespoon butter until dark, but not 
burned. Add one tablespoonful Sperry flour, stir and brown again. Add 
gradually one cup good stock or hot water and stir until smooth and 
thick. Season with salt anl pepper to taste. Simmer five minutes.

Caper Sauce 

Two tablespoons butter, one tablespoon Sperry flour; mix well ; pour 
on boiling water till it thickens ; and one hard-boiled egg, chopped fine, 
and two tablespoons of capers. 

Giblet Sauce 

Take the liver, heart, gizzard and neck of a chicken, wash and boil 
in salted water. Let boil till tender. Take them out with a skimmer 
and chop into coarse pieces. Put them back, add a little butter and 
thicken to a cream. Pepper and salt, boil a few minutes and serve. 

Sauce Robert 

One cup brown sauce made with stock, one teaspoon sugar, one tea- 
spoon made mustard, one tablespoon vinegar. Simmer five minutes. 

Tomato Mustard 

One peck of ripe tomatoes, boiled with two onions, six red peppers, 
four cloves of garlic, for one hour; then add a half pint or half pound 
of salt, three tablespoons black pepper, half ounce ginger, half ounce 
allspice, half ounce mace, half ounce cloves ; then boil again for one 
hour longer, and when cold add one pint of vinegar and a quarter pound 
of mustard ; and if you like it very hot, a tablespoonful of cayenne. 

Mint Sauce 

Mix one tablespoon of white sugar to half a teacup of good vinegar; 
add the mint and let it infuse for half an hour in a cool place before send- 
ing to the table. Serve with roast lamb or mutton. 

Celery Sauce 

Mix two tablespoons Sperry flour with half teacup butter, have ready 
a pint of boiling milk; stir the flour and butter into the milk; take three 
heads of celery, cut into small bits and boil for a few minutes in water, 
which strain off; put the celery into the melted butter and keep stirred 
over the fire for five or ten minutes. This is very nice with boiled fowl 
or turkey. 

Currant Jelly Sauce 

Melt one-half glass currant jelly over slow fire. Add one cup hot 
brown sauce; stir well and simmer one minute. 

Cream or White Sauce 

One cupful milk, a teaspoonful Sperry flour and a tablespoonful of 
butter, salt and pepper. Put the butter in a small frying-pan, and when 
hot, but not brown, add the flour. Stir until smooth ; then gradually 
add the milk. Let it boil up once. Season to taste with salt and pepper 
and serve. This is nice to cut cold potatoes into and let them just heat 
through. They are then creamed potatoes. It also answers as a sauce 
for other vegetables, omelets, fish and sweetbreads, or, indeed, for any- 
thing that requires a white sauce. If you have plenty of cream, use it, 
and omit the butter.

Mayonnaise Sauce 

Mix in a two-quart bowl one even teaspoon ground mustard, one of 
salt and one and a half of vinegar ; beat in the yolk of a raw egg, then 
add very gradually half a pint of pure olive oil (or melted butter), beat- 
ing briskly all the time. The mixture will become a very thick batter. 
Flavor with vinegar or fresh lemon juice. Closely covered, it will keep 
for weeks in a cool place, and is delicious. 

Oyster Sauce 

Take a pint of oysters and save out a little of their liquor ; put them, 
with their remaining" liquor and some mace, and nutmeg, into a covered 
saucepan and simmer them on hot coals about ten minutes; then drain 
them. Oysters for sauce should be large. Having prepared in a sauce- 
- pan some drawn or melted butter (mixed with oyster liquid instead of 
water), pour it into a sauceboat, add the oysters to it and serve it up 
with boiled poultry or with boiled fresh fish. Celery first boiled and then 
chopped, is an improvement to oyster sauce. 

Lobster Sauce 

Put the coral and spawn of a boiled lobster into a mortar with a 
tablespoonful of butter, pound it to a smooth mass, then rub it through 
a sieve; melt nearly a quarter of a pound of sweet butter, with a wine- 
glass of water or vinegar, add a teaspoonful of mustard, stir in the coral 
and spawn and a little salt and pepper, stir it until it is smooth and 
serve. Some of the meat of the lobster may be chopped fine and stirred 
into it.

BLANCMANGE, SOUFFLES, MERINGUES, CUSTARDS, 
CREAMS, ETC. 

Blancmange 

Time, fifteen minutes — Put into a delicately clean stewpan one ounce 
isinglass or gelatine, two ounces of sweet and bitter almonds, blanched 
and pounded, one pint and a half of new milk, and one pint of cream, 
the lemon juice and the peel grated, with loaf sugar to taste. Set the 
stewpan over a clear fire, and stir it till the gelatine is dissolved, then take 
it off and continue stirring it till nearly cold before putting it into the 
mold. This quantity will fill a quart mold, but if you wish to make it in 
a smaller shape, you must not put more than a pint of milk and a half a 
pint of cream. Color the top ornament with cochineal, and allow it to 

! Strawberry Souffle 

Beat the yolks of two eggs in one-half cupful of ripe crushed straw- 
berries, juice of two oranges and one-half cupful of sugar together, then 
,cook for two minutes add one-quarter of a package of gelatine soaked till 
3 soft, the whipped whites of two eggs, and when cold one cupful of 
r whipped cream; turn into a souffle dish surrounded with a paper band; 
cover with strawberry jelly and place on ice until needed. 

Omelet Souffle 

Separate the whites from the yolks of twelve eggs. Put the whites 
into a basin and beat them extremely fast till they form a thick snow. 
Then beat six yolks separately, with two ounces of sugar, and a dessert 
spoonful of orange-flower water, or just enough to flavor it to your taste. 

Before beating the eggs have ready a round tin, well greased all 
over the inside with fresh butter. When you have finished beating the 
six yolks, mix them very quickly with the whites, lest the snow should 
turn- — that is, melt into water. Put it then into the buttered tin, and place 
it in the oven. It will be so thick, if it is well and skillfully mixed, that 
there will be no fear of its running over. Watch it well, glancing at it 
from time to time through a little opening in the oven door, to see how 
lit is going on. As soon as it has risen very high, and if of a golden color, 
jtake it out of the oven. 

Do not suffer the omelet souffle to remain long in the oven. If it 
is not watched it will fall in and become a mere galette. Let the oven 
foe of a very gentle heat, or the bottom of the omelet will be burnt before 
fhe top is done. Before putting the tin in the oven, you may powder the 

Enow with fine sugar; it crystallizes and has a pretty effect. As soon as 
he omelet is done, it must be sent to table. If it waits for longer than 
-en minutes, it falls in. The eggs should be beaten with a fork or a 
little whisk. 

If this souffle is liked more solid, add to the yolks of the eggs when 
beaten two dessertspoonfuls of rice boiled in milk and flavored with 
{vanilla. In this case do not put in the orange-flower flavoring. The rice 
jtnust be very well cooked, and well sweetened before it is added to 
:he eggs.

Ice Cream 

Unsurpassed ice cream can be made with "3C" Dry Whole Milk

To prepare : Mix one pound of "3C" with two and one-half pints of 
water, add five ounces of sugar and flavoring to suit. No eggs, cooking 
or thickening needed, and much less sugar than with ordinary cream. 
In freezing this will swell in volume, depending on the speed and time 
taken, and will often make more than five pints of ice cream. This ice 
cream is most healthful. For one gallon of ice cream use one and one- 
half pounds "3C," eight ounces sugar, two quarts water; flavor to suit.

HINTS ON COOKING AND SERVING. 

Vegetables should be boiled in soft water, if obtainable, if not, a little 

carbonate of soda thrown in will render it so. The water should only 

; be allowed to come to a boil before putting in the vegetables. It is best 

. to boil vegetables by themselves and to boil quickly. When done take 

them up immediately and drain. 

In cooking all vegetables, a teaspoonful of salt for each two quarts 
of water is allowed. Most vegetables are eaten dressed with salt, pepper 
and butter, but sometimes a piece of lean pork is broiled with them, 
which seasons them sufficiently. 



Time Table 

Thirty minutes. — Asparagus, Corn, Macaroni, Mushrooms, Peas, 
Tomatoes, New Cabbage, Cauliflower. 

Forty-five minutes. — Young Beets, Carrots, Parsnips, Turnips, Baked 
Potatoes, Rice. 

One hour/ — Artichokes, String Beans, Sprouts. Greens, Salsify (oys- 
ter plant), New Onions, Winter Squash. 

Two hours. — Carrots, Parsnips, Turnips. 

Three to five hours. — Old Beets. 

Five to eight hours. — Dried Beans, Dried Peas, Hominy, etc. 



Corn Boiled on the Cob 

It is difficult to get corn that has been taken fresh from the field, 
therefore much of its original sweetness is lost. But no time should 
jbe lost in cooking it properly. It is a prevalent custom to cook the cob 
,and thereby sacrifice the corn. Put the corn on to cook in rapidly and 
ireshly boiling water. After it begins to boil, let it cook for five to eight 
iminutes, take out of water, place on a cloth to steam and keep hot, and 
'then on platter to serve at once. 



Sauted Green Tomatoes 

Select smooth tomatoes not quite half ripe. Wash and cut into slices 

i about one-half inch in thickness, drain, dry and dust with salt and pepper. 
Egg and crumb the slices; put three tablespoons of oil or drippings, with 
a bit of butter for flavor, in a frying pan, and when very hot, put in 
tomato slices. Fry until brown on one side, turn and brown on the 
other. Remove from pan with cake turner to retain shape, place on 
heated dish and serve with Hollandaise sauce.

chopped onion. When pale brown add one pint diced boiled potatoes, 
seasoned. Shake till butter is absorbed ; potatoes should not color. Add 
one tablespoon chopped parsley and take up. 

Potato Cakes 

Roast some potatoes in the oven ; when done skin and pound in a 
mortar with a small piece of butter warmed in a little milk; chop a 
shallot and a little parsley very finely, mix well with the potatoes, add 
pepper, salt, shape into cakes, egg and bread crumb them, and fry a 
light brown. 

To Cook Salsify 

Scrape the root and put into cold water immediately; cut into thin 
slices ; boil tender, make a nice white sauce or drawn butter and pour 
over, or boil to a mash ; mix with butter, salt, a little milk and pepper, add 
flour enough and mix as codfish cakes ; and fry in the same manner. 

Summer Squash 

The white scalloped ones are the best. Take them before the rind 
or seeds become hard. Wash and cut in moderately small pieces. Boil 
in clear water until tender enough to mash. Then place in a colander and 
drain. Have ready some bread cut in small pieces (not crumbled). Now 
put in a spoonful of good butter in a skillet. When hot put in the bread 
and stir until brown, then add the squash. Mash and mix well together, 
and season with pepper and salt. 

Green Peas 

Shell into cold water. Then put them into cold water and let simmer 
twenty minutes ; season with plenty of butter and salt and a cupful of 
cream. Canned peas should merely be turned out of the can, liquor 
poured off the peas, rinsed, and let on to boil. When done add milk, 
butter and salt. When they have come to a boil once they are ready 
for the table.

Apple Jelly 

Select sound, red, fine-flavored apples not too ripe; wash, wipe and 
core; place in a granite kettle, cover with water and let cook slowly until 
the apples look red. Pour into a muslin bag and drain; return juice to 
a clean kettle and boil one-half hour; skim. Now measure and to every 
pint of juice allow a pound of sugar; boil quickly for ten minutes. Red 
apples will give jelly the color of wine while that from light fruit will be 
like amber. g ■ 

Quince Jelly 

Do not pare but polish quinces smooth with flannel cloth. Cut in 
j small pieces, core and put all in a kettle. Pour over cold water to cover 
and boil soft. Pour all into a flannel bag and hang up to drain carefully, 
pressing occasionally to make the juice run freely. To one pint of juice 
add three-fourths of a pound of sugar and boil fifteen minutes. Pour into 
tumblers. 

Plum Jelly 

Take plums not too ripe, put in a granite pan and set in a pan of 
water over the fire. Let the water boil genty till all the juice has come 
from the fruit, strain through a flannel bag and boil with an equal weight 
of sugar twenty minutes. 

Crab-Apple Jelly 

Select juicy apples. Mealy ones are no good. Wash and quarter 
and put into a preserving kettle over the fire with a teacupful of water. 
If necessary add more water as it evaporates. When boiled to a pulp 
strain the apples through a flannel bag, then proceed as for other jelly. 

Orange Marmalade 

Cut two dozen oranges in halves, crosswise. With a glass lemon- 
squeezer extract the juice. Dig out the pulp and seeds, throwing them 
away. Soak the peelings over night in salt and water. In the morning 
rinse and boil peelings in clear water until tender, then chop and add 
juice. Weigh and add equal quantity of sugar. Let boil thirty minutes. 
Put in jelly tumbers and cover as you do jelly. 

Tomato Marmalade 

Remove the skins from a peck of tomatoes, slicing them as for the 
table. Put them into a kettle, with a pint of sugar, and spice to taste. 
Cook slowly till they are quite thick. Put them in a jar and pour over a 
little vinegar. This is a nice relish with meat. 

Rhubarb Marmalade 

To one pound of loaf sugar, one pound and a half of rhubarb stalks, 
i peel of half a large lemon, a quarter of an ounce of bitter almonds. 

Cut the rhubarb stalks into pieces about two inches long and put 
| them into a preserving pan with the loaf sugar broken small, the peel 
iof a lemon cut thin, and the almonds blanched and divided. Boil whole 

well together, put it into pots and cover it as directed for other preserves.

peel until very soft, add juice and pulp, with a pound of sugar to a pound 
of lemons. Boil until thick and bottle. 

Grape Marmalade 

Take sound grapes, heat and remove the seeds, then measure, and 
allow measure for measure of fruit and sugar. Place all together in a 
preserving kettle and boil slowly twenty-five minutes ; add the juice of 
one lemon to every quart of fruit. Set away in jelly glasses.

Preserved Peaches 

Select the yellow red-cheeked ones if possible (skin same as toma- 
toes, by pouring on boiling water, then thrusting them in cold water 
and separate in halves). Proceed as for preserving cherries, only using 
three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. 

To Preserve Plums 

To every pound of fruit allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar. 
Divide the plums, take out the stones, and put the fruit on a dish with 
pounded sugar strewed over ; the next day put them into a preserving 
pan and let them simmer gently by the side of the fire for about thirty 
minutes, then boil them quickly, removing the scum as it rises, and keep 
them constantly stirred, or the jam will stick to the bottom of the pan. 
Crack the stones and add the kernels to the preserve when it boils. 

Quince Preserves 

Pare and core the fruit and boil till very tender. Make a syrup of 
a pound of sugar for each pound of the fruit and after removing the 
scum boil the quinces in this syrup for one-half hour. 

Preserved Lemon Peel 

Make a thick syrup of white sugar, chop the lemon peel fine and boil 
it in the syrup ten minutes ; put in glass tumblers and paste paper over. 
A teaspoonful of this makes a loaf of cake, or a dish of sauce nice. 

Preserved Cherries 

Select the large cherries, remove the stems and stone them care- 
fully. To each pound of sugar allow one pound of cherries. Put fruit 
in granite pan and pour over them the sugar. Stir up and let stand over 
night to candy. In the morning put all into the preserving pan, place 
on the stove and boil gently until the cherries look clear, skimming off 
the scum as it rises. When the cherries have become quite clear, remove 
the pan from the stove and seal. Keep in dry, dark closet. 

Preserved Tomatoes 

A pound of sugar to a pound of tomatoes. Take six pounds of each; 
the peel and juice of four lemons and a quarter of a pound of ginger tied 
up in a bag; put on the side of the range and boil slowly for three hours.

Spiced Fruits 

# These are also called sweet pickled fruits. For four pounds prepared 
fruit allow one pint vinegar, two pounds brown sugar, one-half cup 
whole spices — cloves, allspice, stick cinnamon, and cassia-buds. Tie 
spices in thin muslin bag, boil ten minutes with vinegar and sugar. Skim, 
add fruit, cook till tender. Boil down syrup, pour over fruit in jars, and 
seal. If put in stone pots, boil syrup three successive mornings and pour

Wash, stem and mash red or white currants. Use one pound of 
sugar to one pint of fruit. Put the fruit and one-fourth of the sugar 
into a granite kettle; stir and when it boils add balance of sugar. Let it 
boil until very thick. Putting in only a little sugar at a time prevents the 
currants from becoming hard. 

Gooseberry Jam 

Three pounds of loaf sugar six pounds of red gooseberries. Pick 
off the stalks and buds from the gooseberries and boil them carefully but 
quickly for rather more than half an hour stirring continually then add

it all the time to prevent it sticking to the preserving pan. When done 
put it into pots cover it with brandy paper and secure it closely down 
with paper moistened with the white of an egg. 

Raspberry Jam 

To every pound of raspberries use the same weight of sugar, but 
always boil the fruit well before you add the sugar to it, as that will 
make it a better color. Put the fruit in a preserving pan, mashing it well 
with a long wooden spoon. After boiling it a few minutes, add the same 
quantity of sugar as fruit, boiling it half an hour, keeping it well stirred. 
When done, and sufficiently reduced, fill the jars, and when cold cover 
them over with white paper moistened with white of an egg. 

Blackberry Jam 

Crush a quart of fully ripe blackberries with a pound of the best loaf 
sugar pounded very fine; put it into a preserving pan, and set it over a 
gentle fire until thick, add a glass of brandy, and stir it again over the 
fire for about a quarter of an hour; then put it into pots and when cold 
tie them over. 

Strawberry Jam 

To six pounds of strawberries allow three pounds of sugar. Procure 
some fine scarlet strawberries, strip off the stalks and put them into a 
preserving pan over a moderate fire, boil them for half an hour, keeping 
them constantly stirred. Break the sugar into small pieces and mix them 
with the strawberries after they have been removed from the fire. Then 
place it again over the fire and boil for another half hour very quickly. 
Put it into pots, and when cold cover it over with brandy papers and a 
piece of paper moistened with the white of an egg over the tops.

with an equal weight of loaf sugar pounded and sifted. Boil the whole 
till sufficiently thick, and put into pots. 

Peach Jelly 

Pare the peaches, remove about one-half the pits. Place in a kettle 
with enough water to cover. Stir until the fruit is well cooked, then 
strain, and to every pint of the juice add the juice of one-half of a lemon; 
measure again, allowing a pound of sugar to each pint of juice. Boil 
and put up in the usual way. 

Orange Jelly 

Grate the rind of six oranges and three lemons into a granite kettle. 
Now squeeze in the juice, add one cupful of water and one-half pound of 
sugar to each pint of juice; boil all together until a rich syrup is formed. 
Have ready one ounce of gelatine dissolved in a pint of warm water, 
now add the syrup, strain the jelly and pour into glasses. 

Black Currant Jelly 

Gather the currants when ripe, on a dry day, strip them from the 
stalks and put them into an earthen pan or jar, and to every five quarts 
allow a half pint of water; tie the pan over and set it in the oven for an 
hour and a quarter, then squeeze out the juice through a coarse cloth, and 
to every pint of juice put a pound of loaf sugar, broken into pieces; boil 
it for three-quarters of an hour, skimming it well ; then pour it into small 
pots, and- when cold put brandy papers over them and tie them closely 
over. 

Cranberry Jelly 

Place in granite saucepan one quart of cranberries and one cupful of 
water. Cook until soft and turn into flannel bag and let drain over night. 
In the morning measure the juice and allow an equal measure of sugar. 
Boil twenty minutes and turn into glasses. 

Raspberry Jelly 

Heat and strain as above. To each pint of juice allow one pint of 
sugar. Put the juice and sugar into a granite kettle, place over the fire 
and boil until it thickens, when a little is poured on a plate ; carefully re- 
move scum as it rises, pour the jelly into small glasses, cover and keep in 
a dry place.

Chocolate, Vienna Style 

Use four ounces of vanilla chocolate, one quart of milk, three table- 
spoonfuls of hot water and one tablespoonful of sugar. Cut the chocolate 
in fine bits. Put the milk on the stove in the double boiler and when it 
has been heated to the boiling point put the chocolate, sugar and water 
in a small graniteware pan and stir over a hot fire until smooth and 
glossy. Stir this mixture into the hot milk and beat well with a whisk. 
Serve at once, putting a tablespoonful of whipped cream in each cup and

ordinary breakfast cup or half pint. Dissolve the quantity required in 
the corresponding quantity of boiling milk. Boil for half a minute, 
stirring continuously. The delicious beverage is then ready. 

GENERAL RULES FOR CANNING AND PRESERVING 

Canning 

The important points to be observed in canning are, to get only 
sound, ripe fruit ; to have hot syrup and air-tight jars ; to fill jars to over- 
flowing and seal immediately. Jars should be scalded and tested before 
using. Patent canners greatly simplify the work. 

Pick over the fruit, stem, pare, cut, wash, etc., and pack in jars. 
Make syrup by adding one-half pint boiling water to one pound sugar. 
When clear, bring to boiling point and carefully fill the jars. Stand in 
canner or on board in wash boiler containing water up to shoulders of 
jars. Cover and cook according to directions or till tender. Take from 
canner or boiler, add more syrup till overflowing, cover and seal im- 
mediately. 

Amount of Sugar per Quart Jar 

Canned. Preserved. Canned. Preserved 

Pineapple 8 oz 12 oz. Cherries 4 oz 8 oz. 

Crab apples . . .6 oz 10 oz. Strawberries . .8 oz 12 oz.

Peaches 4 oz 8 oz. 

Preserving. 

Preserves require from three-quarters to one pound of sugar to each 
pound of fruit, and one-half cup water to each pound sugar. The fruit 
should be simmered in the syrup until tender, a little at a time ; skimmed 
out into jars; when all are clone the syrup should be brought to boiling 
point, jars filled and sealed. Hard fruits like quinces should be first 
steamed or cooked in boiling water till tender.

Macaroni 

Have a large kettle nearly full of rapidly boiling- salted water. 
Break macaroni into two or three-inch lengths, drop into the water, and 
boil as directed for rice until tender, which will take from thirty to 
forty-five minutes. Drain, then pour cold water through colander to 
remove pastiness. Reheat in a little butter or in a white, brown or 
tomato sauce. Before sending to table, sprinkle thickly with grated 
cheese or stir the cheese through it. 

Spaghetti, vermicelli, or any of the forms of paste may be prepared 
in the same way. 

COFFEE, TEA, CHOCOLATE AND COCOA 

Coffee for Six Persons 

Take one full cup of ground coffee, one egg, a little cold water; stir 
together, add one pint boiling water, boil up ; then add another pint 
boiling water, and set back to settle before serving. 

Vienna Coffee 

Take equal parts Mocha and Java coffee; allow one heaping table- 
spoon of coffee to each person, and two extra to make good strength. 
Mix one egg with grounds, pour on coffee one-half as much boiling water 
as will be needed, let coffee froth, then stir down grounds and let boil five 
minutes ; then let coffee stand where it will keep hot, but not boil, from 
I five to ten minutes, and add rest of water. To one pint cream add white 
of an egg, well beaten ; this is to be put in cups with sugar, and hot 
coffee added. 

Boiled Coffee 

For four heaping tablespoons ground coffee allow one quart freshly 
boiling water and half white one raw egg. Mix the egg white with three 
tablespoons cold water, beating with fork. Add coffee and stir till well 
wet. Scald coffeepot, put in prepared coffee. Pour in boiling water, 
cover spout, and boil five minutes. Pour in quickly one-quarter cup cold 
water, let stand three minutes to settle. Strain into hot pot or have 
strainer on table. 

Tea 

Tea should be made as soon as the water boils, and only a small 

quantity of hot water should be poured on at first. Then it should be set 

back from the fire where it will "draw" for about five minutes, then fill 

up with boiling water and brought to the table. The usual recipe is two 

j teaspoonfuls of tea to each cupful of water, but we advise much less 

! tea than this. 

Water that has stood in the kettle over night should never be used. 
Ceylon tea must be made in small quantities, and made often, as it be- 
comes bitter by standing. Uncolored Japan is considered the purest 
of all teas.

Stuffed Peppers 

Six green peppers from which stem ends and seeds have been re- 
moved. Scald in water to cover, over the simmering burner, from five to 
eight minutes. Drain ready to fill. Make filling from nicely boiled or 
steamed whole and blanched, seasoned with salt, pepper and butter. Or 
a more elaborate filling from "left overs," if at hand ; one and one-half 
cups of rice, three-quarters cup of minced lamb, veil or chicken is used. 
Tomatoes may be stuffed with one-half cup of stewed and strained 
tomatoes; and one teaspoon grated onion pulp. Mix ingredients, fill 
peppers two-thirds full and finish each with buttered bread crumbs. Put 
closely together in a deep baking dish, with one-half cup of stock or water 
in the dish. Cover for first ten minutes in the oven, and bake fifteen 
minutes longer uncovered. A very rare vegetable entree when minced 
lamb, veal or chicken is used. Tomatoes may be stuffed with the same 
mixture, substituting chopped pepper for tomato or using peppers with 
the plain rice. 

Potato Noodles 

Mash boiled potatoes fine and mix with enough flour to make a stiff 
dough. Pinch off bits of the dough and roll between the palms of the 
hands to little strips, the length of your smallest finger. Throw into a 
pot of boiling salted water. When they come to the top skim them out, 
put in a colander and hold under cold running water. When they are 
boiled and cooled, stand until dry. Fry brown in butter and serve with 
steak and tomato sauce. 

Potato au Gratin 

Slice cold boiled potatoes. Make a cream sauce from two table- 
spoons each of butter and flour, one level teaspoon of salt, one-eighth 
teaspoon of pepper. Heat butter in saucepan, add flour and seasoning. 
When hot, add milk gradually and cook smoothly. Add potatoes, let 
heat through and put in buttered individual dishes or baking dish. Fold 
lightly some finely chopped cheese and bake about ten minutes in a 
moderate oven. 

Carrots and Other Root Vegetables 

Scrape or pare carrots, parsnips, turnips. Dice and cook gently in 
unsalted water till tender. Drain and reheat in seasoned butter, one 
tablespoon to one pint, or in a drawn butter or white sauce. In early 
summer, when roots are small, water should be salted. Onions should 
also be boiled in salted water, then finished as here directed. 

Stewed Corn 

Husk corn. Draw sharp knife down center of each row of grains ; 
press out pulp with back of knife. To one pint add one-half teaspoon 
salt, one-half teaspoon sugar, dash pepper, one-half cup cream or rich 
milk. Heat and simmer ten minutes.

Preserved Prunes 

Wash four pounds of prunes and place in a granite pan over the fire 
with enough water to cover ; set the pan over a slow fire and cook slowly 
until the fruit is tender, then remove, and pass through a sieve. To each 
pound of the pulp add three-quarters of a pound of sugar; make a syrup 
of the sugar with a little water and add the pulp. Boil for fifteen 
minutes. Seal. 

Spanish Dish 

Take one cupful boiled rice, then fry two tomatoes and a half an 
onion together, season with pepper, salt, half teaspoon sugar and half a 
chili pepper. Mix with rice, all together, then add four tablespoonfuls 
of grated Swiss cheese and one cupful of cooked shrimps. Cook on back 
of stove half an hour. Very good, eaten hot or cold. 

Spanish Beans 

Soak two cups pink beans over night. In the morning cover beans 
with water, add a small onion and boil until beans will mash between 
fingers; drain the liquid from the beans, but do not throw it away. Into 
a frying pan, not less than two inches deep, put a large cooking spoonful 
of fresh lard. Allow it to become quite clear. After laying in as many 
beans as will absorb lard, place the pan over a hot fire and mix beans 
and lard thoroughly together until the beans appear to have a coating 
of lard and begin to burst. Add a cupful of the liquid in which the beans 
were boiled and gently crush the beans with a spoon, but do not mash. 
Now add the remainder of the liquid and allow to simmer on the back 
or stove for half to one hour, or until the beans are of the consistency 
desired, either with considerable liquid (but thick) or quite dry. Success 
depends upon observing the following rules : Do not add salt until the 
beans are boiled soft. The onion is not perceptible after cooking, only 
gives the beans the characteristic Mexican taste, which no spice can 
produce. Have the lard at boiling point. Mexican chili may be added 
after the last portion of liquid is used. 

To prepare Mexican chili, take half a dozen dry chili peppers, remove 
seeds and cover with water and boil ten minutes. Chop fine and run 
through sieve to remove skins. Put in as much or as little, according 
to how hot you like them. 

Spanish Rice 

Take three onions, cut them up fine, and a small piece of garlic 
cut fine, and put them in a pan with two or three large green peppers, 
cut small and fry not too brown ; then add one can of tomatoes, salt and 
pepper to taste and a little prepared chili con carne. Now have a small 
pan with hot lard, put in rice and fry not too brown ; then take rice and 
mix together with the sauce and fry slowly for about one hour. You will 
find this a delicious dish, also a very fine vegetable. 

String Beans Spanish 

Boil one pound of string beans until tender, let them cool; beat 
the white of three eggs until thick, put in the yellow, beat five minutes 
more, take six or seven string beans and roll them in the egg and fry 
them and serve with tomato sauce.

Winter Squash 

Cut in pieces, take out the seeds and pare as thin as possible ; steam 
or boil until soft and tender. Drain and press well, then mash with 
butter, pepper, salt and a very little sugar. Summer squash may be 
cooked the same way ; if extremely tender they need not be pared. 

Broiled Mushrooms. 

In order to test mushrooms, sprinkle salt on the gills — if they turn 
yellow they are poisonous, if they turn black they are good. After test- 
ing, pare and cut off stems, dip in melted butter, season with salt and 
pepper, broil on both sides over a clear fire and serve on toast. 

Baked Mushrooms. 

Toast for each person a large slice of bread and spread over with 
/ich, sweet cream ; lay on each side, head downward, a mushroom, or if 
small more than one; season and fill each with as much cream as it will 
hold. Place over each a custard cup, pressing well down to the toast ; set 
in a moderate oven and cook fifteen minutes. Do not remove the cups for 
five minutes after they come from the oven, as thereby the flavor of the 
mushroom is preserved in its entirety. 

Creamed Potatoes 

Put a pint of milk (or one-half pint of cream) in a frying-pan and 
let heat ; add a piece of butter the size of a butternut, thicken with Sperry 
flour, can be cut into cubes. Boil twenty minutes in slightly salted 
water, taking care that they do not break, then drain and let cool a little. 
Now prepare a golden sauce as follows : Boil one-half cupful of milk or 
water with one-half dozen pepper corns and one teaspoonful of salt. 
When flavored, strain it into another saucepan and add one-half cup of 
butter and the yolks of three eggs, beat with a fork, over the fire, until it 
thickens like cream. Then squeeze in the juice of one-half of a lemon 
or a tablespoonful of vinegar. Pour over the potatoes and garnish with 
sprigs of parsley. 

Lyonnaise Potatoes 

Take six cold boiled potatoes, place them in a frying-pan with a 
piece of butter the size of an English walnut and an onion chopped up 
raw. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. Cook for ten minutes, 
stirring until well browned. Chop a little parsley and sprinkle over. 

Potato Cakes 

Grate raw potatoes and add a little salt, a piece of butter and an egg. 
Beat all well together, dredge with flour. Drop them into good drippings 
and fry a light brown. Cold mashed potatoes can be made in the same 
manner, but they are not as nice.

Succotash 

Time, one hour and a half.— Cut off the corn from the cobs, and 
put the cobs in just water enough to cover them, and boil one hour; 
then remove the cobs and put in the corn and a quart of Lima beans, and 
boil thirty minutes. When boiled, add some cream of milk, salt and 
butter. 

Parsnip Fritters 

Time, one hour and a half to boil. — Boil four or five parsnips until 
tender, take off the skins and mash them very fine, add to them a tea- 
spoonful of flour, one egg, well beaten, and a seasoning of salt. Make the 
mixture into small cakes with a spoon, and fry them on both sides a 
delicate brown in boiling butter or beef drippings ; when both sides are 
done, serve them up very hot on a napkin or hot dish, according to 
your taste. 

Stewed Celery 

Time, one hour and twenty minutes. — Wash four heads of celery 
very clean, take off the dead leaves, and cut away any spots or discolored 
parts. Cut them into pieces about two or three inches long, and stew 
them for nearly half an hour. Then take them out, strain the water they 
were stewed in, and add it to half a pint of veal gravy, mixed with three 
or four tablespoonfuls of cream. Put in the pieces of celery and let them 
stew for nearly an hour longer. Serve with the sauce poured over. 

Rice Croquettes

Saratoga Chips. 

Peel the potatoes carefully, cut into very thin slices and keep in 
cold water over night ; in the morning drain off the water and rub the 
potatoes between napkins until thoroughly dry, then throw a handful at 
a time into a kettle or pan of very hot lard, stirring so that they may not 
adhere to the kettle or to each other. As soon as they become light 
brown and crisp remove quickly with a skimmer and sprinkle with salt 
as they are taken up. 

Cucumbers a la Creme 

Cucumbers of medium size are best for this dish. Pare and quarter 
or dice six cucumbers ; remove the seeds and soak for one-half hour, 
or until crisp, in water. Put into a saucepan, cover with boiling water, 
add a teaspoon of salt, and boil about thirty minutes, or until tender, 
Drain and add one and one-half cups of cream sauce, allowing to cook a 
moment or two in the sauce. 

Spinach 

Wash in several waters, until entirely free from sand. When young 
and tender, put in a deep stewpan, add one-quarter cup of water and 
cook slowly, covered for fifteen or twenty minutes, in its own juices. Old 
spinach should be cooked in boiling salted water, two quarts of water 
allowed to one peck of spinach. Drain well, reheat, season with salt* 
pepper and oil or butter. Garnish with slices of hard-boiled eggs, or to 
suit individual taste. 

String Beans

short lengths and wash. Boil in salted water until tender — from one and 
one-half to three hours. Drain, season and butter, salt and pepper.

boiling water, to which has been added a little salt. Cook until tender, 
then add half a pint of milk, one dessertspoonful of flour which has been 
moistened with a little milk and one heaping teaspoonful of butter. Boil 
for five minutes and serve with boiled potatoes. 

Asparagus on Toast 

Have stalks of equal length ; scrape lower ends ; tie in small bunches 
with tape. Cook twenty to thirty minutes, according to size. Dip six 
or eight slices dry toast in asparagus liquor, lay on hot platter, place 
asparagus on them, and cover with a white or drawn butter sauce; in 
making sauce use asparagus liquor and water or milk in equal quantities. 

Kidney Beans, Brown Sauce.

Beefsteak Spanish 

Take a piece of round steak rather more than an inch thick, put on a 
pie plate; add a little water to baste it with and bake 30 minutes; take 
it out and cover with a layer of onions (chopped) ; bake until the onions 
are cooked; take out again and put on a layer of sliced tomatoes. 

Italian Dish 

Cook one pound of macaroni in salt water ; get one or two pounds of 
lean steak, cut in small squares, fry in a pan, then remove and put in one 
large, finely chopped onion, a large tablespoonful of dry flour; brown this 
carefully in the grease ; then add slowly one can of strained tomatoes ; 
cook about five minutes ; put in a layer of the macaroni in a deep baking 
dish, a few pieces of the steak, another layer of the macaroni and steak, 
cover the top with macaroni; add a few pieces of stick cinnamon; pour 
your sauce over the whole ; grate some good, strong cheese over the top 
and bake brown. If you want something nice, try it. 

Mexican Stuffed Chili 

Select even sized green peppers and cut out the stems, seed and core. 
Make a stuffing of sardines and cheese chopped fine. Mix it with one egg. 
Stuff the peppers with this. Dip in thick butter and fry in deep, hot fat. 
Drain in a colander. When done serve very hot. 

RECIPES FOR INVALID COOKING 

Always prepare food for the sick in the neatest and most careful 
manner. In sickness the senses are unusually acute, and far more sus- 
ceptible to carelessness, negligence, and mistakes in the preparation and 
serving of food than when in health. 

To Make Gruel 

Pour one quart of hot water into a clean earthen or tin vessel over a 
brisk fire; when it boils, add two large tablespoonfuls of corn or oat- 
meal ; mix it smooth in just enough water to thicken it ; put a small lump 
of butter into the water and when melted, add the meal and stir for about 
one-half hour ; then add a teacupful of sweet milk, and when it boils again 
throw in the upper crust of hard-baked bread, cut into small pieces ; let 
it boil some time and add a little black pepper, a little salt, a pinch of 
grated nutmeg, a little more butter and a teaspoonful of French brandy. 
The butter, spices and brandy should be omitted when the case is a 
serious one. 

Beef Tea 

Take one pound of lean beef, cut it fine, put it in a bottle corked 
tightly, and put the bottle into a kettle of warm water; the water should 
be allowed to boil for a considerable time; the bottle should then be 
removed and the contents poured out. The tea may be salted a little and 
a teaspoonful given each time. Another way of preparing it is as follows : 
Take a thick steak, broil slightly on a gridiron until the juices have 
started, and then squeeze thoroughly with a lemon squeezer. The juice 
thus extracted will be highly nutritious.

over them till the jar is full. Let it stand nine days, stirring it every day. 
Strain it off and to every pint of juice add three-quarters of a pound of 
white sugar. Boil it as long as any scum rises, and bottle up for use.

ful of the brown sauce. Pour all over the chop suey; stir together and 
serve. 

Noodles

for about ten minutes each day will receive the greatest relief. If used 
regularly for a month is said to cure all corns and callous places on the 
feet. Will not blister or do any injury. 

Burns 

Get a small bottle of picric acid and with a feather paint the burned 
or scalded parts, allowing it to dry. In a few minutes all the pain will be 
gone and you will never feel it again. Where the burns are very severe 
remedy, especially where there are children in the home, for they are

There is nothing better than sulphur tea for the hair. It cures dan- 
druff, promotes the growth, makes the hair soft and glossy and is very 
good to keep the hair from turning gray. 

The whitish stain left on a mahogany table by a jug of boiling water 
or a very hot dish may be removed by rubbing in oil and afterward 
pouring a little spirits of wine on the spot and rubbing it dry with a 
cloth. 

Place pieces of camphor, cedarwood, tobacco leaves, bog myrtle or 
anything else strongly aromatic in the drawers or boxes where furs or

Wash your weathered oak woodwork and furniture with milk. 

To rid 3^our home of ants, which are numerous here in California: 
Mix thoroughly two parts borax with one part powdered sugar and put 
around where the ants come. For two or three days the ants will come 
in swarms, but after that they will disappear. Leave the powder around 
for a week or two and you will never be bothered again with ants. 

If food becomes slightly burned in cooking, set the saucepan in cold 
water and it will take away burned taste. 

Silver knives, forks and spoons are worn out and scratched more in 
the washing than in their use. Buy a child's wooden pail, have a car- 
penter put cross pieces in it, dividing it into four compartments, one 
for knives, the second for forks, the third for tablespoons and the fourth 
for teaspoons. Make some hot, soapy water and pour into the pail. After 
gathering silver from table put them each in their own part of pail, 
leaving until ready to wash, then washing each lot separately. In this 
wav they need less cleaning and are not scratched. 

To clean bathtub, wash bowl or toilet, use coal oil on cloth, then

Keep there for a short while, remaining perfectly quiet. 

A can of chloride of lime should always be kept around the kitchen 
sink ; it not only acts as a disinfectant, but is very useful for cleansing- 
porcelain sinks. It will remove brown stains from the porcelain white- 
ware by putting about a tablespoonful in the vessel and filling with water 
and allowing to stand over night. Of course, the hands should not come 
in contact with the solution.

Mildew in white clothes may be removed by soaking for a short time 
in a pail of water to which has been added a heaping teaspoonful of 
chloride of lime. Then hang in sun. Repeat if necessary. 

When frying potatoes, etc., try chopping with empty baking powder 
can instead of knife. You will find it much more handy and quicker. 

Try greasing cake and bread pans with a small five cent paint brush. 
Keep grease in round tin can : cut hole in cover and insert handle of 
paint brush when not in use. It is then always ready for use and does 
not soil hands. 

To prevent cake from burning when using new tins, butter the new 
tins well and place them in a moderate oven for fifteen minutes. After 
this the cake may be cooked in them without danger of burning. 

When ironing with gas, place a lid of the coal stove over the gas 
burners and place the irons over this. The irons will always be clean and 
heat much better than if they are put directly over the gas flame. 

To clean plaster of paris figures, use toilet soapsuds and a shaving 
brush. Rinse well. Dipping them in a strong solution of alum water 
will give them the appearance of alabaster. 

To preserve gilt frames, cover them when new with a coat of white 
varnish. All specks can be washed off with water without injury. 

Lemons to keep — Put in water. Change once a week. Will keep a 
long time. 

Do You Know — 

That a small piece of butter added to the water prevents vegetables, 
macaroni or rice from boiling over? 

That the water from macaroni or rice after they have been cooked 
should be saved for soup and gravies? 

That a teaspoonful of vinegar added to boiled meat, while cooking, 
makes the meat tender? 

That after peeling onions if celery salt is rubbed over the hands 
before washing the odor will disappear? 

That if you add a pinch of salt to ground coffee before boiling it will 
improve the flavor? 

That if kid gloves are rubbed gently with bread crumbs after each 
time they are worn they will remain clean much longer than otherwise? 

That a poultice made of tobacco and warm water, put between 
two cloths and placed over the breast and pit of the stomach will relieve 
convulsions when nothing else will? It will do no harm.
