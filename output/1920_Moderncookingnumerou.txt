TO 
MY FAMILY FOR THEIR UNTIRING 
EFFORTS IN BEHALF OF THIS BOOK 



PREFACE 

The influence of well-cooked, palatable food upon the 
health and general well-being of the family is as certain 
as that of changes of temperature and more serious in 
its consequences for lasting good or ill. 

The sage old saying "Tell me what you eat and I will 
tell you what you are" is as full of the "pith o' sense" to- 
day as in ye days of long ago, for food either makes us 
physically fit and fully efficient, or miserable failures 
with physical complications that keep us constantly in 
the physician's hands. 

The vital essences of that which we prepare for eating 
are "medicinal messengers" bearing light to the eye, vigor 
to the limb, beauty to the cheek and alertness to the 
brain, as vitamines, or distorted in the misdirected process 
are the harsh heralds of pain and debility to the human 
system. How great then is the influence of the one who 
prepares it! 

Influence, according to astrology, was "a power or 
virtue flowing from the planets upon men and things," 
but from the kitchen, as a sun and heat centre, there truly 
flows a planetary influence that makes or mars us. 

Scientific cooking means the elimination of waste, the 
preservation of edible resources and conservation of their 
potential energy through the preparation of attractive, 
vitalizing food with minimum cost and labor, thus pro- 
viding in wide, deep measure, for harmony, personal 
comfort and domestic peace. 

The preface of a book is too often a flat, spiritless ex- 
cuse for offering it to the public instead of being a hearty 
announcement in welcome terms of the arrival of a much- 



PREFACE 

desired provision for a real need, so I will come to the 
essential point at once by sa3ring that gathered here, in 
these pages, are my best recipes, truly "tried in the fire," 
the actual working result of many years' teaching and 
lecturing, brought "up to the minute" in the interests of 
that exacting domestic economy now, as rarely before, 
imperative in its demands. 

It will also be noted that the heavy cook-book style is 
not used here but the recipes are presented as if house- 
wife and author were conversing upon the dish in ques- 
tion, and to her I will say : economical, palatable food is 
within your reach if you will discard the ideas and 
methods of long ago. Remember, you would not prefer 
to ride in a horse car, as a means of conveyance, so why 
use the recipes of those days? 

The capable housewife, whose busy hands bake bread, 
cake and pastry, spreads forth to the community an in- 
fluence that is priceless, a largesse not of festal day, holy 
day, qr holiday, but thrice daily, wholesome and welcome 
as spring's first sunbeam and precious to every home so 
blessed, ever growing and radiating. May this book help 
in that growth and a greater radiation !

MODERN COOKING 

Bread, the staff of life, must be palatable and good if 
we are to be satisfied with it when we eat. 

Can you think of anything that will spoil a meal more 
quickly than poor, over moist, doughy or heavy bread? 

Bread may truly be called the staff of life, as it will 
maintain life longer than any other single food. 

Yet many women think bread-making is a simple task ; 
that the ingredients can be thrown together helter-skelter 
and good results obtained ; or that any kind of flour will 
make good bread. This is a great mistake. To make 
good palatable bread it requires good materials, a reason- 
able amount of care and attention. But first of all must 
come the knowledge of the flour. 

A good blend of hard winter flour is necessary and it 
can easily be tested by pressing a small quantity of it in 
the hand; if the flour is good, it will retain the shape of 
the hand. Graham or whole wheat flour and rye flours 
can be used for variety and to advantage in making bread. 

Other cereal flours do not contain gluten to allow them 
to be used alone for making the yeast-raised breads. 
Keep this in mind and thus prevent failures. The yeast 
is a single-cell plant and must be given the proper tem- 
perature, moisture and food for its successful growth. 
When this is supplied, each little cell multiplies a thou- 
sand times, thus pushing and stretching the dough. This 
makes it rise or become light. 

WHY DOUGH FALLS 

When the yeast cells have absorbed or consumed all the 
food th^ they can obtain from the sugar, flour, etc., the 

1 



2 MODERN COOKING 

dough will recede or fall. Now, if the dough is carefully 
handled at a given time, this will not take place, and so 
for this reason the dough is permitted to stand only for a 
given length of time before it is worked and then placed 
in the pans. 

Few utensils will be required for making bread, but 
they must be scrupulously clean, if the bread is to have a 
good flavor. Potatoes and other cooked cereals may be 
used with good results. Compressed yeast will give the 
best results, and either the sponge or straight dough 
method may be used. 

Bread made by the sponge method will require a longer 
time to make than the bread that is made by the straight 
dough method. Sponge dough consists of setting the 
sponge and letting it rise until it drops back, usually in 
two and one-half hours, and then adding sufficient flour 
to make a dough that can easily be handled. 

The straight dough method consists of making a dough 
at the start. To make bread successfully, do not set the 
dough over the range, do not set it on the radiators and 
do not place it where it will be in a draft, to rise. Cold 
chills the dough and retards the yeast. Yeast grows suc- 
cessfully only in a warm moist temperature from 80 to 
85 degrees Fahrenheit. 

DOUGH BOX 

I would like to tell the housewife about a dough box 
that I have found to work very successfully. The baker's 
success in making bread is founded on the fact that he 
can regulate the temperature of his shop and thus pre- 
vent drafts from chilling the dough. This box is just an 
ordinary cracker box with the lid hinged on it. It is 
then lined with thick asbestos paper on the inside and 
then covered with oilcloth on the outside. The bowl with 
the dough is then placed in the box to retain its tempera- 
ture and to be free from drafts while it rises. In cold 
weather this box can be heated by placing a warm iron 



MODERN COOKING 8 

in it when starting to mix the dough, and then removing 
the iron before placing the dough in the box. This box 
will easily pay for the time and cost in a few weeks, 
and then, too, it will prevent failure. 

Now to get the proper temperature — always use a ther- 
mometer. Remember that you cannot successfully gauge 
the correct temperature of liquids that are used for mak- 
ing bread by testing with the finger or by testing them 
from the spoon. Any plain thermometer that can be 
found in the house will do for this work. Scrub it with 
soda and water to remove the paint. Remember, in cold 
weather to heat the mixing bowl. See that the flour is 
not lower than 65 degrees Fahrenheit. 

All water or half water and milk may be used in mak- 
ing bread. When the milk is used it must be scalded and 
then allowed to cool. Evaporated or condensed milk does 
not require scalding. Simply add the hot water to ac- 
quire the proper temperature. 

POINTS THAT WILL MAKE FOR SUCCESSFUL 
BAKING 

Earthen mixing bowls or clean cedar pails make the 
best utensils to set the bread dough in. These utensils 
will retain the heat and are easy to clean, and when they 
are closely covered, prevent a hard crust from forming 
on the dough. 

Do not fail to give the dough plenty of proof — ^that is, 
let it rise for a sufficient length of time as given in the 
recipes. 

Use a good grade of blended flour. 

Use the ball of the hand, near the wrist, to knead and 
work the dough. Kneading is most important and should 
be thoroughly done. Do not be afraid of hurting the 
dough ; you can handle it as roughly as you like. Heavy, 
active kneading distributes the yeast organisms and de- 



4 MODERN COOKING 

velops the elasticity of the gluten and gives body and 
strength to the dough. 

Now, a word about the baking. Bread is baked to kill 
the fermentation and to hold the glutinous walls of the 
dough in place and to cook the starch and thus make it 
palatable and easy to digest. 

An oven 350 degrees Fahrenheit is necessary. Do not 
have it any hotter than this. Too much heat browns the 
loaf before it has time to bake in the centre. 

SALT 

Salt controls the action of the yeast. It also retards 
or delays the proper fermentation if too large an amount 
of it is used. Then again, if not enough salt is added to 
the mix, the yeast becomes too active and thus produces 
an overlight loaf of bread. One ounce of salt to each 
quart of liquid in summer, and three-fourths of an ounce 
in winter will give the best results to the home baker. 

BAKING THE BREAD 

Now turn on a moulding board and cut into five parts 
or loaves. Allow about nineteen ounces to each loaf. 
Take the dough up between the hands and work into a 
round ball. Place on the moulding board and cover for 
ten minutes. Now with the palm of the hand flatten out 
the dough and then fold half-way over, pounding well 
with the hand. Now, take the dough between the hands 
and stretch out, knocking it against the moulding board, 
fold in the ends and shape into loaves. Place in well- 
greased pans and brush the top of each loaf with shorten- 
ing. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes. Bake in a hot 
oven for 45 minutes and brush with shortening when 
removing from the oven. Let cool and then the bread 
is ready to use. 

SPONGE METHOD 

Generally speaking, the sponge method produces a 



MODERN COOKING 6 

lighter and whiter loaf than the bread made by the 
straight dough method. Bread made by the straight 
dough method has the advantage over bread made by the 
sponge method in flavor, texture and keeping qualities. 

SPONGE METHOD 

One quart of water or half Two and one-half quarts 

water and half milk, 80 or two and one-half 

degrees Fahrenheit pounds of flour 

Two yeast cakes One ounce of sugar 

Dissolve the sugar and yeast in the water and add the 
flour. Beat to thoroughly blend and then set aside to 
rise for three hours, then add 

One ounce of salt One and one-half quarts or 

One and one-half ounces of one and one-half pounds 
shortening of flour 

Work to a smooth elastic dough. This takes usually 
about ten minutes, after the flour is worked into the 
dough. Place in a greased bowl and then turn over the 
dough to coat with shortening. This prevents a crust 
from forming on the dough. Set aside to rise for two 
hours and then pull the sides down to the centre of the 
dough and punch down. Turn the dough over and let 
rise for one and one-quarter hours. 

THE CARE OF THE BREAD AFTER BAKING 

The jar, crock or box in which the bread is kept should 
be scrupulously clean. It should be scalded and aired one 
day every week in winter and three times weekly during 
the spring, summer and early fall. Keep the fact in 
mind that the bread kept in a poorly ventilated box will 
mould and spoil and thus be unfit for food. 

Place the freshly baked bread on a wire rack to thor-

and crumbs. 

THE FOOD VALUE OF BREAD 

Wheat contains the sixteen needed elements for nutri- 
tion, and when made into palatable bread, it forms about 
40 per cent, of our total food requirements. Stale bread 
digests much easier than fresh bread for the reason that 
when thoroughly masticated in the mouth the saliva acts 
directly upon the starchy content. Fresh bread, unless 
thoroughly chewed, so that it may be well broken up, be- 
comes a hard, pasty ball in the stomach, which requires 
that organ to manufacture the additional gastric juices 
to break up this dough ball. 

Bread from one to three days old easily digests. Gra- 
ham and whole wheat breads contain a larger percent- 
age of nutriment than the white breads. 

OVEN TEMPERATURE 

Many housewives feel that it is impossible to secure 
accurate results in baking in the gas range ; this is due to 
the fact that few women really understand the principle 
of baking with gas. 

To secure a slow oven, light both burners and let them 
burn for five minutes; then turn both of them down 
low, turning the handle that controls the flow of gas two- 
thirds off. This will maintain a steady even heat. A 
slow oven requires 250 to 275 degrees Fahrenheit of heat. 
A moderate oven is 350 to 375 degrees Fahrenheit of 
heat. It can be obtained by burning both burners of gas 
range for eight minutes and then turning them down 
one-half to maintain this heat. 

A hot oven requires 425 to 450 degrees Fahrenheit and 
will need to have the burners burning twelve minutes 
and then turned off one-quarter. 

This heat is intense and entirely too hot for breads, 
pastries and cakes. Meats require this heat for one-half 



MODERN COOKING 7 

of the length of time in the period of cooking. This heat 
is also necessary for broiling, grilling, etc. 

Now, also try to utilize the full oven space when bak- 
ing by cooking two or more dishes at the same time. 
Vegetables may be placed in casseroles or earthen dishes 
or even ordinary saucepans ; cover them closely and cook 
in the oven until tender. This will not injure other 
foods baking in the oven. 

Do not place breads, cakes and pastries upon the top 
shelf; rather, place them on the lower shelf and cook in 
moderate oven. Do you know that there are still among 
us women who firmly believe that placing other foods to 
cook in oven with cake will surely spoil it? This is a 
mistake; utilize every bit of oven space. 

An oven thermometer soon pays for itself. Pay strict 
attention to heating the oven ; if the oven is too hot, the 
heat is wasted, while it cools sufficiently. This wastes 
gas. When food is first placed in the oven, keep oven 
door closed for first ten minutes and then open when 
necessary. 

Placing food in oven will materially reduce the heat. 
Do not try to increase the heat ; just as soon as the mix- 
ture acquires the heat, the baking will begin in the usual 
manner and the dish will be ready to remove from oven 
in given time. 

Never keep the oven waiting for the food; rather let 
food remain in cool place while oven is heating. 

Before mixing materials select the pans that will best 
fit the oven. This does not mean that you must discard 
your present equipment. It means that you should place 
in groups such pans that entirely fill oven space without 
crowding. Keep this fact in mind when purchasing new 
utensils. 

The best and whitest rye flour is milled from the centre 
of the grains in a manner similar to wheat flour. When 
only the bran is removed from the milling, we have the 



8 MODERN COOKING 

darker flour, carrying a heavy pronounced flavor. The 
rye meal is used for making pumpernickel, a Swiss and 
Swedish rye flour bread. 

HOME-MADE YEAST 

Wash four potatoes and then cut in slices, without 
peeling, and place in saucepan, and add three pints of 
water. Cook until the potatoes are soft and then add 

One-half cupful of hops. 

Cook slowly for one-half hour. Rub the mixture 
through a fine sieve and then pour hot mixture on 

One and one-half cupfuls One-quarter cupful of 

of flour brown sugar 

One taUespoonful of salt 

Stir until well mixed, beating free from lumps. Cool 
to 80 degrees Fehrenheit. Now add 

One yeast cake dissolved in one cupful of water, 
80 degrees Fahrenheit 

Stir well to mix and then let ferment in a warm place 
for ten hours. Now pour into jar or crock and store in 
a cool place. 

TO USE 

Use one and one-half cups of this mixture in place of 
the yeast cake. Always stir well before using and take 
care that the mixture does not freeze. This potato fer- 
ment must be made fresh every eighteen days in winter 
and every twelve days in summer. 

STRAIGHT DOUGH VIENNA 

One quart of water or milk One ounce of salt 

One ounce of sugar 

Stir well to thoroughly dissolve, and then add 



MODERN COOKING 9 

Two yeast cakes Four quarts of flour 

• One and one-half ounces of shortening 

Work to a smooth dough and then knead for ten 
minutes. Then place in a well-greased bowl, turning the 
dough over to thoroughly coat. This prevents a crust 
from forming on the dough. 

Cover the bowl and set aside to rise for three and one- 
half hours. Now lay over the dough by pulling in to- 
ward the centre, the sides and ends of the dough until 
it forms a compact mass. Turn over the dough, cover 
and let rise for one hour. Now place on the moulding 
board and proceed to form into loaves, using the same 
method as in the sponge dough. 

TO PREPARE LOAF 

When the dough is ready to mould into loaves, pro- 
ceed ; using method as given in sponge dough, finally roll- 
ing the loaf on the moulding board, making it pointed 
at the ends. Now place a clean cloth in a deep baking 
pan and sprinkle the cloth with cornmeal. Place the loaf 
of dough on the cloth and sprinkle it lightly with corn- 
meal. Now lift the cloth up close to the dough, making a 
cloth partition between each loaf. 

Let the dough rise, about 45 minutes, and when ready 
to bake, lift dough carefully from the cloth and lay on 
a baking sheet and gash slightly with a sharp knife. Wash 
with an egg and water, wash and bake forty-five minutes 
in a hot oven, adding a small saucepan of boiling water 
to provide steam to keep the loaf moist while baking.

straight dough method. When the dough is ready for 
the pans, cut or divide into six pieces and mould into 
loaves, three inches thick and twelve inches long, and set 
to rise like the Vienna bread, then bake, using the same 
method. 

RYE BREAD

One yeast cake Two tablespoonfuls of 

Five cupfuls of white flour shortening 
Three cupfuls of rye flour 

Work to a dough and ferment three and one-quarter 
hours, then proceed as in the straight dough method. 
When the dough is ready for the pans use the same 
method as for Vienna bread. Bake in a similar manner, 
having the oven heated to 450 degrees Fahrenheit. ^ Rye 
bread requires an oven hotter than for wheat bread. 
Wash the rye bread when taking it from the oven with 
warm water. Caraway seeds may be added if desired.

and then stone and with a pair of scissors cut into small 
pieces the size of a raisin. When the bread is ready to 
go into the pans add the prunes and knead the dough well 
to distribute the prunes. Then place in pans and proceed 
as usual.

CALIFORNIA ORANGE BREAD 

Grate the rinds of two oranges and then place in a 
bowl and add 

One cup of orange juice. Four tablespoonfuls of 

•warmed to 80 degrees sugar 

Fahrenheit One and a half teaspoon- 
Two tablespoonfuls of fuls of salt 

melted shortening One egg 

Beat to mix and then dissolve one yeast cake in one cup 
of water 80 degrees Fahrenheit, and add to the above mix- 
ture ; then work in sufficient flour to make a smooth elas- 
tic dough; usually about eight cups. Place in a greased 
bowl and turn the dough to thoroughly coat with grease. 
Cover and let rise for three hours. Pull the corners of 
the dough to the centre and punch down, turn over and 
let rise again for one hour. Repeat the pimching down 
and then let rise for three-quarters of an hour. Turn 
out on a moulding board and mould into three loaves, 
adding 

One-half cupful of seeded One-half cupful of chopped 
raisins to one loaf almonds to second loaf 

and keep the third loaf plain. Place in greased pans and 
let rise for three-quarters of an hour. Bake in the hot 
oven for 40 minutes. The temperature of the oven 
should be 400 degrees Fahrenheit. 

This bread is delicious for sandwiches. Undoubtedly 
one of the causes of the failure in making breads at home 
is that the process is hurried and the bread is insufficiently 
baked. The size and shape of the pans affect the quality 
of the bread. Avoid too deep or shallow pans. A pan, 
7}4 by 4J4 inches, will give the best results. 

Turn the bread on a wire cake rack to cool. This per- 
mits the free circulation of air.

Now for the trick. When the buns are baked, brush 
the pastry board with shortening, then place 

Two tablespoonfuls of One tablespoonful of water 

brown sugar 

in a saucepan, mix thoroughly, and then bring to a boil. 
Now, just as soon as the buns are baked, turn from the 
pan at once and brush well with the prepared syrup, 
brushing the bottom with the syrup, as brushing the 
candied part of the buns prevents it from hardening. 
Let cool and then use.

HOW TO MAKE YEAST-RAISED CAKE 

Scald one cupful of milk and add one-half cupful of 
cold water. Cool the mixture to 80 degrees. Now add 
four tablespoonfuls of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt. 
Crumble one yeast cake in the mixture and stir thor- 
oughly until the yeast is dissolved. Now add four cup- 
fuls of sifted fiour and beat to a light batter. Cover, and 
set in a place free from drafts, where it will be kept 
warm in a temperature of 80 degrees and let rise for 
three hours. Now beat the dough with a spoon and let 
rise again for three-quarters of an hour. Now, while 
the dough is raising last time, place one cupful of sugar 
and one-half cupful shortening in a bowl and cream until 
light and frothy. Add two eggs, one at a time, and beat 
until very light. When the dough is ready, add the 
sugar, eggs, shortening and one and one-half cupfuls of 
flour; beat this mixture with spoon for twelve minutes 



22 MODERN COOKING 

iintil thoroughly mixed. Now pour in prepared mould 
filling the mould half full. Set in warm place, with a 
temperature of about 80 degrees Fahrenheit, to rise for 
one and one-quarter hours or until the mixture fills the 
mould. Bake in a moderate oven for three-quarters of 
an hour. 

Remove the cake from the mould and cool on a wire 
rack. This cake may be iced or served plain ; or chopped 
nuts, raisins or citrons may be added to the dough with 
the sugar and eggs. To prepare the pans; grease them 
thoroughly, then coat them with finely chopped nuts or 
fine cake crums before pouring in the dough. 

BRIOCHE 

Brioche is a French sweet bread and while different 
authorities do not agree as to both the consistency and 
methods, without doubt these cakes figure largely in 
French cuisines. 

One French bakery prepares the brioches in loaf form 
and when cold it is cut in slices and steeped in orange 
syrup. Then again the brioche is spread with jam and 
then covered with icing or the brioche may be steeped 
with prepared syrup and then dipped in a batter and fried 
golden brown in hot fat. Spread with jam and serve 
with orange or lemon sauce. 

The actual preparation of the brioche involves very 
little trouble and can be made from bread dough on bak- 
ing day. Now one point in making these sweet breads 
— ^there is just the same trick as in moulding the loaf of 
bread. One can learn by careful attention to details and 
with practice. Some stress may well be laid upon the 
lightness of the dough ; for heavy, overrich dough that is 
poorly baked is injurious to health.

SWEET DOUGHS 

In the days of long ago, yeast, ammonia, pearly ash, 
honey water and a treacle mixture were used to lighten 



24 MODERN COOKING 

cakes — before the time of dependable baking powder. 

In Europe the housewife makes from bread dough de- 
licious cakes with yeast. These provide splendid variety. 
They include savarins, babas, and yeast-raised fruit cakes. 

Many women fail in making these delicious goodies be- 
cause they do not realize that the addition of large 
amounts of sugar, fruit, shortening and eggs to yeast 
dough, unless carefully handled, is apt to produce heavy, 
moist cakes that lack the light, velvety texture which 
makes cake a success. 

The addition of nuts, cake crumbs and fruit will afford 
a large variety. 

A sponge dough is necessary for successful results. 

GRIDDLE CAKES 

To bring the true nut flavor from the buckwheat we 
must go back to old-fashioned method of setting the 
buckwheat to rise overnight. Don't you remember the 
brownstone crock that was kept in the pantry and each 
time it was left with just enough of the mixture to start 
a new batter? The buckwheat would be prepared each 
night just before bedtime, and in the morning a cup of 
warm water was added, together with a couple of table- 
spoonfuls of syrup. The mixture was beaten and then 
the griddle was put on to heat. Sometimes it was a soap- 
stone or a heavy iron griddle. When well heated it was 
rubbed with a piece of cut turnip or potato. The batter 
was poured on in large platter-sized cakes and then as 
quickly as they browned they were dexterously turned 
to brown again. 

To make perfect buclcwHeat calces you must first of all 
obtain a stone-ground flour, and then it must be blended 
in proportion. Good, lively yeast is added, and if milk is 
used for the mixing it must be scalded and then cooled 
before using. To prepare the flour for the mixing: 



MODERN COOKING 25 

Three pounds of buck- One pound of corn flour 

wheat flour One ounce of salt 

One and one-half pounds One-half ounce of baking 

of wheat flour soda 

Sift twice to thoroughly mix and then place in a dry 
container and the flour is then ready to use. 

BUCKWHEAT CAKES 

Scald and then rinse out with cold water a large stone 
crock. Pour in one cupful of scalded and cooled milk 
and 

One and one-half cupfuls Two tablespoonfuls of 

of water, 80 degrees sugar 

Fahrenheit, 

Crumble in one-half of an yeast cake and stir until dis- 
solved, then add three cupfuls of the prepared buckwheat 
flour. Beat to thoroughly mix and then cover and set 
aside overnight to rise. In the morning add sufficient 
lukewarm water to bring the mixture to a pouring con- 
sistency. This usually requires about one cupful. Add 
two tablespoonfuls of syrup. Beat hard for three 
minutes and then let stand in a warm place while the 
griddle is heating, then bake. 

RICE GRIDDLE CAKES 

Rice griddle cakes may be prepared as follows : Wash 
one-half cup of rice in plenty of water and then place 
in a saucepan and add three cupfuls of water. Cook until 
the water is absorbed and the rice is soft. Let cool. 
Now place in a crock 

Two and one-half cupfuls Two tablespoonfuls sugar 
water, 80 degrees Fah- One-half yeast cake 
renheit 

Stir until dissolved and then add 
The prepared rice One-quarter teaspoonful 

Three cupfuls white flour baking soda 



26 MODERN COOKING 

Beat to mix and then cover and set aside to rise over- 
night. In the morning add sufficient lukewarm water to 
make a pouring batter, adding two tablespoonfuls of 
syrup and one teaspoonful of salt. Beat very hard and 
then set in a warm place while the griddle is heating. 

The use of a small amount of baking soda as given in 
above recipes is for the purpose of neutralizing the 
slightly acid flavor of the buckwheat — a flavor to which 
many folks object. 

Either of above mixes may be baked in a waffle iron 
instead of using the griddle. Try it some morning for 
the sake of variety. Use salad oil in a new sewing- 
machine oil can to grease waffle iron. 

Almost everyone loves good sweet butter on the hot 
cakes in the morning. At the present prices of butter the 
frugal housewife looks upon the fast disappearing pat of 
butter with alarm. Now try this and save the butter and 
yet give the folks the butter flavor upon their cakes ; place 
two tablespoonfuls of butter in a pitcher which will hold 
a cupful of syrup. Add the syrup and then place the 
pitcher in a pan of warm water and set on the stove to 
heat. Beat constantly until the butter melts and produces 
a creamy mix. 

Stale bread may be crumbled or soaked in cold water 
pressed dry and used in place of rice or cornmeal. So 
may oatmeal or other leftover breakfast cereals, as well 
as mashed potatoes, be used. Reserve about one cupful 
of the yeast batter to start the next batter. Use this 
starter in place of the yeast. Renew the yeast mix every 
fifth morning. 

A word about the griddle may not come amiss. The 
old-fashioned iron or soapstone may be used and will 
give good results. Aluminum griddles do not require 
greasing.

of the usual breakfast dishes. Place in pitcher over night 
Two cups of huttermilli or One cup of water

Beat hard and then let rise overnight; then prepare as 
for buckwheat cakes. 

Modern methods have eliminated the yeast and sub- 
stituted baking powder, thus making a quicker mix. To 
prepare buckwheat cakes with baking powder, prepare a 
blend of flour as follows : 

Two pounds of buckwheat Three ounces of baking 

flour powder 

One pound of wheat flour One-quarter ounce bolting 

One cupful cornmeal soda 
One ounce of salt 



28 MODERN COOKING 

Sift three times to mix and then place in a dry con- 
tainer and use as required. 
HOW TO BAKE THE PANCAKE 

Use a frjang-pan that is perfectly flat; the iron ones 
are best, as they hold the heat longer and can be regulated 
so that the cake will not burn. 

PANCAKES FOR TWO 

Yolk of one egg One teaspoonful salt 

Two tahlespoonfuls sugar One teaspoonful vanilla or 

or syrup nutmeg 

One cupful milk One and one-quarter 

One tablespoonful cupfuls flour 

shortening Two level teaspoonfuls 

baking powder 

Place in a bowl. Beat with a Dover egg-beater to thor- 
oughly mix and then fold in the stiffly beaten white of 
egg. Pour the mixture into a pitcher and then place two 
tahlespoonfuls of shortening in a frying pan. When 
smoking hot pour in just sufficient batter to cover the bot- 
tom of the pan. When it oegins to bubble turn the cake 
over and bake on the other side. Lift and spread lightly 
with jelly or roll, or use the following mixture : 
Three tahlespoonfuls butter 
One-half cupful of XXXX sugar 

Cream well, and then add 
One tablespoon lemon juice 
One tablespoon boiling water 

Beat to blend. 
PLAIN PANCAKES 

Place in a bowl one quart of milk and then add 
Two eggs Four tablespoonfuls syrup 

One-half teaspoonful Five level teaspoonfuls 

nutmeg baking powder 

Five cupfuls sifted flour 



MODERN COOKING 29 

Beat to mix and then bake. To insure sufficient cakes 
use two pans for cooking or bake on a griddle. 

IRISH PANCAKES

potatoes One cupful milk 

Two cupfuls flour Four tablespoonfuls syrup 

One teaspoonful salt One and one-half tea- 
Three teaspoonfuls baking spoonfuls nutmeg

Beat to thoroughly mix and then bake on a griddle. 
Spread with butter and sugar. 

BELGIUM PANCAKES 

Two cupfuls of unsweet- Two and one-half cupfuls 

ened thin applesauce flour 

One well-beaten egg Three teaspoonfuls baking 

Three tablespoonfuls syrup powder 
One tablespoon shortening 
One-half teaspoonful cinnamon 

Beat to mix and then bake in the usual manner. Serve 
with butter and syrup. 

WAFFLES 

Waffles are made from a thin batter and are baked in 
a well-heated waffle iron. Many failures to make good 
waffles are due to the fact that the iron is not sufficiently 
hot. The iron must be thoroughly cleaned after each 
baking. Place the iron on the range to heat, turning it 
several times. 

Try this method in greasing the iron. Purchase a 
large-sized sewing machine oil-can, wash well in plenty 
of hot water and soap, then rinse thoroughly and dry. 
Now fill with a good salad oil and when the iron is 



30 MODERN COOKING 

heated, oil it on both sides. Now you are ready to bake 
the waffles. Reverse the iron, having the hot side on top, 
and pour in the batter and then bake about three minutes, 
reversing the iron once. 

When the waffles are baked remove from the iron and 
then oil and reverse it again, putting the side that was 
next to the fire on top and then pour in the batter, close 
and bake as before. 

QUICK BREADS 

Quick breads include griddle cakes, waffles, muffins, 
Sally Lunns, shortcakes and biscuits. These doughs are 
made light or leavened by the use of eggs, baking soda, 
baking powder and steam created in baking and by air 
beaten into the mixture. Their entire success depends 
upon the careful measurements of ingredients, the mixing 
and the baking. Using all water in place of milk or equal 
parts of milk and water will give splendid results. 

GRIDDLE CAKES 

Place the griddle on the range to heat slowly, while 
mixing the batter. 

Place in a bowl or a flat, wide-mouthed pitcher 

One cupful milk Two and one-half cups of 

One cupful water flour 

One teaspoonful salt Two tdblespoonfuls 

One tahlespoonful syrup shortening 

Four level teaspoonfuls baking powder 

Beat to mix to a smooth batter. This amount of bat- 
ter will make hotcakes for four persons. For larger 
amounts, multiply. One egg may be used for every two 
cupfuls of flour. 

Test the griddle by dropping a few drops of water on 
it ; if the water boils, the griddle is sufficiently hot to bake 
with. Aluminum jffiddles do not require any grease. 



MODERN COOKING 81 

Rub with a clean cloth dipped in salt. Grease iron 
griddles slightly. Pour on the batter; just as soon as the 
cakes begin to form air bubbles slip a cake-turner under 
the cakes and turn them. 

Now, if large bubbles rise at once to the top of the 
cakes, the griddle is too hot and the heat should be re- 
duced; while, if the cake stiffens before the underside is 
brown the griddle is not hot enough. Never turn a 
griddle cake twice — ^this makes them heavy. Serve them 
as soon as baked, piling not more than five or six to- 
gether. Sour milk may be used in place of sweet milk. 
Discard the baking powder and use one level teaspoonful 
of baking soda for each cup of sour milk. One egg and 
two cupfuls of water may be used in place of two cupfuls 
of milk. 

WAFFLE BATTER 

One cup of milk Three teaspoonfuls baking 
One cup of water powder 

One egg One tablespoonful syrup 

One teaspoonful of salt Two tahlespoonfuls 
Two and one-quarter shortening 

cupfuls flour 

Beat to a smooth batter in a wide-mouthed pitcher. 
One-half of this amount for two people. 

Cold boiled rice, hominy, oatmeal and stale bread that 
has been soaked in cold water and then pressed dry and 
rubbed through a sieve may be added to the griddle cakes 
and wafHe batters. 

MUFFINS 

Muffins are made from a drop batter and may be baked 
in rings, on a griddle, in muffin pans or in custard cups. 
To bake the muffins in rings on a griddle upon the top

of the stove — grease the griddle well, and also have the 
rings well greased. Put the griddle on to heat when 
starting to mix the drop batter and keep the rings cool 
until ready to bake. 

Place in a bowl or pitcher 

One and one-half cupfuls Two tahlespoonfuls syrup 
of milk or equal parts of Two tahlespoonfuls 
milk and water shortening 

One egg Two and three-quarters 

One teaspoonful salt cupfuls flour 

Five level teaspoonfuls baking powder 

Beat this mixture smooth and then place the rings on 
a hot griddle and half fill with the drop batter. When 
well risen and nearly dry, turn over, using the griddle- 
cake turner to turn the muffins and rings. Bake on the 
other side. It will require about eighteen minutei to bake 
these muffins. Tear them apart, butter and serre them 
at once. 

To bake muffins in pans or custard cups, grease the 
pans or cups well and half fill with the drop batter and 
then bake in a hot oven for fifteen minutes.

SOUTHERN SPOON BREAD 

The success of making and baking this delicacy de- 
pends entirely upon a thorough beating of the batter and 
a hot oven. The southern mammy invariably uses the 
coarse white oatmeal, but you may use the yellow and ob- 
tain just as good results. 

Place one quart of boiling water in a saucepan and 
then add one teaspoonful of salt, two tablespoon fuls of 
shortening and one and one-half cupfuls of cornmeal. 
Pour the meal in slowly, and just as soon as it boils re- 
move from the fire and let cool. Now add 

Yolks of Mo eggs Two cupfuls of sour milk 

One cupful flour 

in which you have dissolved one level teaspoonful of 
baking soda and one-half cupful of syrup. 

Beat this mixture with a large spoon and now cut and 
fold in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs. Pour in hot, 
well-greased baking dish and bake in a quick oven. 

To add soda to the sour milk, dissolve the soda in one 
tablespoonful of the milk before adding to the remainder 
of the milk, and then use a Dover egg-beater and beat 
for three minutes to thoroughly mix.

SCONES 

Scones are delicious hot breads that are served for 
breakfast in the British Isles ; they replace the American 
pancake and for tea replace our hot biscuits. Many varie- 
ties of scones are made in Scotland. Currants, citron 
and raisins are used in the dough, while in other parts 
of the United Kingdom these cakes are split, buttered 
and served with marmalade or gooseberry jam.

One egg One cup of milk 

in a bowl ; beat to mix. Use this to form the dough, roll 
out one-half inch thick, cut and fry golden brown in hot 
fat 

HOW TO FRY CRULLERS OR DOUGHNUTS 

When ready to fry place four cups of vegetable oil in 
a pan. The pan should not be too large and the fat 
should be deep enough to allow the cruller to swim at 
least two and one-half inches from the bottom of the 
pan. 

GOLDEN BROWN 

Heat the fat and test before starting to cook by drop- 
ping in a small piece of the dough and starting to count 
101, 102, 104 and so on until 110 is reached. The 
sample should now be floating on top and a light brown 
in color. Do not attempt to start frying before this 
time, as the fat will not be sufficiently hot and the crullers 
will soak up the grease. Drop four or five doughnuts in 
the hot fat at a time, turning constantly, and cook until 
golden brown, lift, let drain few seconds, lay on paper 
towelling and then roll in sugar and cinnamon.

FRUIT CAKE 

A handsome and rich fruit cake is usually the accepted 
cake for weddings and anniversaries. In the days of long 
ago the young women of the household delighted to show 
their skill in the making and baking of this queen of

sable feature of the feast, and the reveler of to-day holds 
it in equal esteem as did his grandad before him. Here 
is an old and treasured recipe :

MODERN COOKING 



One cup of honey 
One cup of brown sugar 
Three-quarters cup of good 

shortening 
One teaspoon of cinnamon 
One teaspoon of nutmeg 



One-half teaspoon of 

ginger 
One-half teaspoon of 

cloves 
One-quarter teaspoon of 

allspice 



Yolks of three eggs 
Cream together and then add 

One-half pint cup of spiced One-half pint cup of any 
jam kind of jelly 

Beat again to blend and then add 

Six cups of sifted flour Three-quarters cup of 
Four tablespoons of baking strong black coffee 
powder 

Beat just enough to mix and then cut and fold in the 
stiffly beaten whites of three eggs and add 

One and one-half cups of One-half cup of finely 
seeded raisins chopped orange or 

One cup of seedless raisins lemon peel, mixed 



One-half cup of seeded 

currants 
One and one-half cups of 

finely chopped peanuts, 

or other nuts 
One cup of finely chopped 

citron 



One cup of finely chopped 

figs 
One cup of finely chopped 

apricots 
One cup of finely chopped 

and stoned prunes. 



Mix in the fruit well and then grease and flour a round 
pudding pan and line with three thicknesses of greased 
and floured paper. Pour in the cake mixture and cover 
the top of the cake with a well-greased paper. Now set 
the pan containing the cake in a large baking pan, which 
contains about, three cups of boiling water. Place in a 
slow oven and bake for two and one-half hours. Re- 
move and let cool and then turn from the pan and brush

the paper with boiling water to remove. Now to ripen or 
age. 

WHITE POUND CAKE 

Four ounces of butter 

One and one-half cups of sugar 

Cream until light and frothy, and then add 

One cupful of milk One teaspoonful of almond 

Three and one-half cupfuls extract 

of flour One-half teaspoonful of 

Four teaspoonfuls of mace 

baking powder 

Beat for five minutes to blend and then cut and fold in 
the stiffly beaten whites of five eggs. Bake in prepared 
pans for one hour in a moderate oven. Use the pans pre- 
pared the same as for the fruit cake. Golden cake may 
be made from this recipe, using the yolks of seven eggs. 

To use successfully you must use good shortening, 
pastry flour, granulated sugar and fresh eggs. Exact 
care in measuring with the proper methods of compound- 
ing and finally careful baking are necessary. Now for 
another point : do not stir the cake after its final beating. 

In filling the cake pan put the mixture well into the 
corners and leave a slight depression in the centre. This 
will leave the cake perfectly smooth on top. Now, if the 
oven is too cool when the cakes go into it the cake will 
rise over the top of the pans and become coarse-grained. 
While, on the other hand, if it is too hot it will brown 
quickly on the top before the cake has had a chance to 
rise; then when the dough does attempt to rise it will 
break through and crack the crust. Too much flour will 
also cause this. Now to break the old hoodoos about 
cake-baking! You may look at the cake after it is in the 
oven ten minutes if you will open and shut the oven door 
gently, and if necessary to remove the cake wait until it 



34 MODERN COOKING 

has reached its full height and is beginning to brown. 
Then it may be removed carefully without danger of fall- 
ing. Sometimes it may be necessary to remove the cakes 
so that they may brown evenly. Icing the cakes greatly 
improves their appearance. Should the cake for any rea- 
son scorch, don't trim it with a knife. This spoils its 
appearance ; instead use a grater and remove the scorched 
part. 

Turn the cakes to cool upon a sieve or wire cake-rack. 
Do not attempt to ice a cake until it is cool and then coat 
the entire cake over with a plain water icing.

PASTRY 

Now it all rests with the cook as to whether we are go- 
ing to have a cut of pastry that fairly melts in your mouth 
or a tough doughy mass that is unfit for food. 

Any little housewife may turn out delicious, flaky 
pastry if she will but follow directions carefully. First 
of all, let us study for a minute just what pastry is. It 
is a mixture of flour, shortening and water. Each grain 



70 MODERN COOKING 

of flour is thoroughly coated with shortening and then 
mixed to a dough with the water. Do I hear you say 
"Well I know that ?" Surely you do. But do you know 
the real knack of putting it together? For here is the 
real rub. The minute you knead or squeeze pastry that 
is the moment you make it tough. 

THE REAL SECRET 

Sift 

Three cups of flour One teaspoon of salt 

Three teaspoons of baking powder 

together twice, and then cut or rub into this two-thirds 
cup of shortening. If you cut it in, use your griddle- 
cake turner or spatula and chop it in rather coarse. Now 
mix to a dough with one-half cup of ice-cold water, using 
the cake-turner to mix the water in; just keep chopping 
and turning over until the mixture is formed into a ball 
of dough. Do not knead or pat with the hand. You 
cannot hurt this dough if you will just mix it as a man 
does when mixing mortar with a hoe. Keep working it 
back and forth, chopping it each time until well mixed. 
This amount will make the tops and the bottoms for two 
pies. 

, To roll the dough, divide it into four parts and then 
lift one piece on a sUghtly floured board and roll out the 
dough, working the rolling pin to and from you and 
turning the dough as often as necessary to secure the size 
and shape desired. 

Should the dough tear, or not come to the desired 
shape, just fold it into squares or oblongs and then 
roll again. 

Place on the tin and then trim the edges. Proceed in 
the same manner with the top crust, and then when ready 
to place on the pie, fold from corner to corner, making 
a bias fold and then cut quarter-inch gashes with a knife 
in centre to allow steam to escape. Lift and cover the 



MODERN COOKING 71 

pie and then trim to shape. Now do not form the trim- 
mings into a ball, but lay them one piece upon the other in 
a pile and flatten them with the rolling pin. Roll and 
fold into shape, and roll as desired. 

You can re-roll pastry as often as desired by this 
method. Keep in the mind the fact that kneadmg or 
squeezing the pastry forms it into a sticky mass. This 
method will give you a delicious, flaky crust. You may 
spread two tablespoons of shortening upon the top crust 
and then fold and roll. Fold again and roll ; then use as 
desired. 

Sufficient pastry may be made at one time to last for 
two or three days. Just wrap the dough in wax-paper 
so that it does not dry out. Various fillings may be used. 
Fresh or canned fruits, custards, mince meat, etc. If you 
use fresh fruits place 

One-half cup of sugar 

Three level tablespoons of cornstarch 

in a bowl and rub between the hands to thoroughly mix 
then use this by sprinkling over the fruit. This will pre- 
vent the juice from boiling out of the pie while it is cook- 
ing and it will form into a jelly when cold. 

To use canned fruit, drain the fruit free from the 
liquid and then cut into thin slices. Measure the liquid 
and then add 

Four level tablespoons of cornstarch 
Eight tablespoons of sugar 

to each cupful. Dissolve the starch and sugar in the cold 
liquid and then bring to a boil. Cook for three minutes 
and then add the prepared fruit. Cool before placing in 
the pastry. 

To prevent the lower crust from becoming soggy just " 
before putting in the filling, brush it well with a good 
salad oil, or shortening, taking care that each part is 
covered. This will give you a tender, flaky lower crust. 



72 MODERN COOKING 

Just before the pie is ready to put into the oven brush 
it well with a wash of egg and milk, using 

Yolk of one egg One-half cup of milk 

Two teaspoons of sugar 

Stir to dissolve the sugar and mix in the egg. Then 
wash the pie. This will keep a week in a cool place. 

The correct temperature to bake a pie is 300 to 350 
degrees Fahrenheit. This means a moderate oven. Too 
much heat will brown the crust before the filling inside 
has had the time to cook. Custard pies — ^this includes 
those made of eggs ,milk, lemon meringues, sweet potato 
and pumpkin — require a slow oven — 250 degrees Fahren- 
heit. 

PASTRY FOR CUSTARD PIE 

The most important point in the custard pie is the 
crust, which will either make or mar the pie. So to begin 
with, the pastry should be light and delicate. To make 
pastry for custard pie place in a bowl 

Three cups of flour Three teaspoons of baking 

One teaspoon of salt powder 

Two tablespoons of sugar 

Sift to mix and then rub in one-half cup of good 
shortening, and then mix to a dough with one-half cup 
of ice water. When mixing the pastry to a dough, it is 
important that it should be cut and folded together much 
after the method used in cutting and folding the whites 
into a cake. Care at this point in making the pastry will 
prevent it from becoming tough. Now wrap the pastry 
in wax or parchment paper and place on the ice to thor- 
oughly chill for two hours. Now if the pastry is made 
either the day before or early in the morning, and then 
allowed to blend, it will be delightfully light and flaky. 

Now to prepare for the pie: This amount of pastry 
will be sufficient for two large pies, one custard and one 



MODERN COOKING 73 

lemon, for variety. The trimmings can be made into 
little tarts, turnovers or cheese straws. Divide the pastry 
into two parts and then roll out one part on a lightly 
floured board until sufficiently large to fully cover the pie 
tin. 

Now fold carefully in half and then in quarters and lift 
on the pie plate and open covering the pie plate, easing on 
the pastry. Trim the edges and then roll out the trim- 
mings into a long narrow strip. Cut into strips three- 
quarters inch wide and then brush the edges of the 
pastry on the pie plate with water and add this narrow 
strip as a reinforcement to build up the edge. This will 
prevent the custard overflowing. 

Now brush the pastry in the bottom of the pie plate 
with melted shortening, taking care to thoroughly coat 
the entire surface with the shortening. Then pour in the 
prepared custard. Reserve about one tablespoon of the 
custard to brush the pastry around the edges. Place in a 
slow oven and bake until the custard is firm in the centre. 

To test if custard is baked, gently insert a silver knife 
into the custard, taking care that the knife does not pierce 
the crust. 

Brushing the pastry with the shortening before pour- 
ing in the custard prevents the moisture from soaking 
into the crust. 

TO MAKE THE MERINGUE 

Beat the whites of two eggs in a bowl, which is free 
from grease, until stiff, and then cut and fold into the 
stiffly beaten whites of the two eggs 

One-half cup of pulverized Three tablespoons of 
sugar cornstarch 

Sift the sugar and cornstarch to thoroughly mix and 
then carefully cut and fold into the whites of eggs. 

On just how careful you are in cutting and folding this 
mixture will determine the success of your meringues. 



74 MODERN COOKING 

After the whites are beaten stiff they are full of little air 
bubbles, which if stirred break down and become watery 
and then the entire mixture becomes flat and tough. To 
prevent this, sprinkle the prepared sugar over the stiffly 
beaten white of egg and then with a spoon cut down 
through the centre and fold over; turn the bowl half- 
way around, then cut and fold again. Repeat this until 
sufficiently mixed, then place on the hot pie, sprinkle 
with granulated sugar and place in the oven to brown. 
Open the oven door and let stand for a few minutes, then 
remove to a place free from drafts where it will cool 
slowly, so as to prevent a sudden shrinking of the 
meringue, due to a sudden chill. 

To make cocoanut pie, add one-half cup of cocoanut to 
the custard pie just before putting in the oven. 

PEACH CUSTARD PIE 

Crush a sufficient number of pared peaches to measure 
one cup. Place in a mixing bowl and add 

One-half cup of sugar 

Now place in a saucepan 

Three-quarters cup of milk 
Two tablespoons of cornstarch 

Stir to dissolve and then bring to a boil. Cook for two 
minutes and then pour very slowly, while beating hard to 
blend, on the peaches and sugar that are blending in the 
mixing bowl. 

Add 

Yolks af two eggs 

One-quarter teaspoon of cinnamon

SHORTCAKE 

The shortcake is typical of Scotland. It is a mixture 
of flour, sugar and shortening worked to a paste and then 
rolled one-half inch thick and then decorated in various 
ways. The thrifty Scotsman, after leaving the mother 
country and settling in the new America, felt that the 
use of much shortening was too expensive, and so his 
thrifty housewife, who was willing and even anxious to 
be a partner to him, cooperated by cutting down on the 
amount of shortening and still turn out a rich palatable 
cake. This is how she does it: Place 

Two cups of flour Two level tablespoons of 

One-half teaspoon of salt sugar 

Two level tablespoons of baking powder

is more nutritious than the potato and it digests more 
readily. When properly cooked and served it is an ideal 
starchy food. 

Unpolished rice contains all the nutritions of the 
grains, which is approximately 6 per cent, fat, 8 per 
cent, protein, 79 per cent, carbohydrates. The polished 
variety contains an average of 88 per cent, nutrition. 
Polished rice has been robbed of its vital life-giving 
elements. 

Rice is graded for size and condition and then prepared 
for the trade. It is known as fancy head rice, choice, 
prime, good, medium, common and screenings. Patna 
rice, the small slender, well-rounded grain, is in great 
demand in the East, with the Japan, Siam, Java, Ran- 
goon, and Passein varieties closely following. In this 
country the Carolina, Japan and Honduras are popularly 
in demand. 

The Carolina rice is a large sweet-flavored grain of 
good color and appearance. Japanese rice is a thick- 
bodied, soft-grained variety. Honduras variety is the 
slender, well-shaped grain. 

The preparation of rice for the markets involves, first, 
the threshing, and second, the milling, which removes the 
husks, and, third, the polishing to produce the pearly 
white gloss which so many folks think is very desirable. 

Polished rice has been robbed of nearly all its fat and 
mineral contents, and thus its food value is lowered and it 
is deprived of its flavor. 



MODERN COOKING 87 

The rice dishes, as prepared in the Oriental countries, 
are made from fancy unpolished head rice and they form 
some of the main dishes. 

The Oriental first washes his rice in several waters, 
rubbing it vigorously between the hands. This thor- 
oughly cleanses it. Now, to follow this method, have a 
saucepan containing boiling water and then add the rice 
slowly, so that the water continually boils. Cook until 
tender and then remove the lid from the saucepan and 
cover the rice with a cloth to absorb the moisture. Set 
in a warm place for five minutes. This will give the 
saucepan containing it a mass of delicious, fluffy rice, each 
grain distinct and separate. 

Now, if you carefully measure both your rice and then 
the water, it will not be necessary for you to drain off the 
excess water and thus lose the valuable mineral and fat 
content. 

HOW TO COOK RICE AMERICAN STYLE 

Place in a double boiler two and one-half cups of boil- 
ing water and then add one teaspoon of salt. Now add 
slowly one-half cup of well-washed, unpolished rice. 
Cover and cook until the rice is tender and the water ab- 
sorbed. Remove the lid and then cover the rice closely 
with a clean napkin and cook for five minutes. This will 
fluff each grain of rice. 

It is now ready to serve, either as a vegetable to re- 
place the potato or prepared into many delectable dishes 
that our Oriental neighbors relish so keenly.

The cultivation of rice in Louisiana is more than a hun- 
dred years old. Louisiana now produces a crop of this 
cereal larger than the entire crop of the states of Georgia 
and Carolina. The tourist who visits Louisiana during 
the time of the rice market enjoys a scene that is rarely 
duplicated elsewhere in the civilized world; for here are 
gathered the buyers from all parts of the country. 

The Creole of Louisiana, like the Oriental, has the true 
secret for making this food a palatable article of diet. 
The old mammy in New Orleans always tells her children 



90 MODERN COOKING 

that, of course, le riz must be thoroughly washed and 
she always insists that the grains be cleansed in four 
waters — ^two warm and two cold — ^and then it is cooked 
in the same manner as the Orientals use. 

Never stir the rice while it is cooking ; this will make it 
mushy. Instead, always shake the saucepan. Never 
flood the rice with water while it is cooking. Always 
keep the fact in mind that just five times the actual meas- 
urements of the rice in water will be required to cook it. 

In this way there will be no excess water to drain off. 
So if you are using one-quarter cup of rice you would 
use one and one-quarter cups of water. Now you can- 
not pile up the water ; you must be accurate in measuring 
the rice. 

Boiled rice is a delicious accompaniment to chicken, 
lamb, turkey, shrimp, crabs and lobster — with okra and 
for oyster, chicken and crab gumbo; as a vegetable to 
replace potatoes and as a border for stews, goulashes, etc. 

PIMENTO SANDWICHES

CALAS 

The old negro women of the old French quarters in 
New Orleans used to make a delicious rice cake, which 
they carried in bowls on their heads. The bowls were 
covered with an immaculately clean cloth and the cakes 
were called bella cala — ^tout chaud of New Orleans.

RHUBARB 

To cook rhubarb, cut it into inch pieces and remove 
the stringy peel. Cook in a glass or earthen casserole 
dish in the oven until it is soft, adding just enough sugar 
to sweeten. This will give you a splendid product. 

Do not use the leaves of the rhubarb. And do not 
cook rhubarb in tin; the mineral salt or acid content of 
the fruit reacts upon the metal and sets up an active 
poison. 

TO COOK RHUBARB FOR PIES 

Prepare the rhubarb and then sprinkle well with flour 
and add sugar, and cook slowly until tender. The flour 
will thicken the mixture. Then pour into the prepared 
pie plate and cover with pastry. Bake in a moderate oven 
for twenty minutes. Pie made in this way will be far 
superior to that made where the rhubarb is cut and placed 
in the pie and then cooked. 

RHUBARB AND RAISIN CONSERVE 

Wash and peel and then cut the rhubarb into one-half 
inch pieces. Measure one quart of the cut pieces and 
place in a baking dish, adding

cooling place 

White of one egg One-half glass of jelly 

in a bowl and beat with a Dover egg-beater until light 
and fluffy. Add one-half cup of finely shredded candied 
ginger and then cooled gelatine. Whip until it begins to 
thicken and then pour into moulds to become firm. 

Note. — Do not add the gelatine mixture to the fruit 
whip until just before it thickens. 

GINGER DELICACIES 

The West Indians make and serve many delicious des- 
serts and conserves made with ginger. Either the pre- 



MODERN COOKING 101 

pared ginger in pots may be used or the ordinary ginger 
root may be obtained from the grocery shops. Ask for 
stem ginger, as this kind is less apt to be stringy and 
coarse. 

To prepare: Soak the ginger in warm water over 
night and then in the morning wash, using a vegetable 
brush. Now scrape well and then place in fresh water 
enough to cover — ^and cook gently on the back of the 
stove until tender. Or it may be placed in the fireless 
cooker over night. When the root is tender, place 

Three cupfids of sugar water 

Three-qitarters cup of Juice of one lemon 

in a saucepan and bring to a boil. Cook for ten minutes 
and then add the ginger. Now place where it will just 
keep warm and simmer until the syrup is absorbed. Re- 
move and stand in a cool place for two days. Reheat and 
then drain on a sieve and roll in sugar. Pack in an air- 
tight tin box and the ginger will keep indefinitely. 

PINEAPPLE MOUSSE 

Drain and mince sufficient pineapple fine to measure 
two cups. Put through a fine sieve and then place in a 
bowl ; place whites of two eggs in a second bowl and add 
one glass of apple jelly. Beat until very stiff. Whip 
one cup of cream stiflf and add one-half cup of sugar. 
Gently combine the fruit whip, whipped cream and puree 
of pineapple by cutting and folding until well mixed.

A FEW POINTERS ABOUT VEGETABLES 

Do not oversalt vegetables. Never salt while cooking; 
too much salt not only toughens the delicate fibres but 
also neutralizes the valuable mineral content. 

Add just sufficient boiling water to cover and then 
bring to a boil. Then cook slowly until tender. Do not 
cover the saucepan in which the vegetables are cooking. 
This condenses the steam which contains the volatile oils 
and thus darkens the vegetable.

free these crinky little leaves from the sand and grit. 
Now rinse in plenty of cold water to crisp it. Shake 
the spinach dry and place in a deep saucepan and cover 
and then steam gently until tender. Do not add any 
water. In this manner the spinach is virtually cooked 
in its own juices. Now turn into a chopping bowl and

FRUIT SOUP 

The French, Swiss and Danish housewives serve dur- 
ing the summer a delicious fruit soup. In Normandy, 
during apple-blossom time, the petals of the fruit are 
picked as they fall and are used for fruit soup, blossom 
jelly and perfume and distilled water. 

HOW TO MAKE THIS SOUP 

You may use any fruit desired; wash to thoroughly 
cleanse, and to each pint of crushed fruit allow three 
pints of water. The fruit must be packed solidly. Place 
in a kettle and cook until the fruit is soft and then rub 
through a fine sieve. Now measure and add 

One-half cup of sugar Four tablespoons of cold 

Three tablespoons of com- water to each pint 
starch, dissolved in 

of the fruit puree. Bring to boil and cook five minutes. 
Remove from the fire and add yolk of one egg. Beat 
very hard and then fold in stiffly beaten white of egg; 
season slightly with nutmeg, chill and serve. 

Strawberries, blackberries, raspberries, huckleberries, 
cherries, grapes, currants, apples, peaches, pears, oranges, 
lemon and quinces may be used for these soups. They 
are delicious when served ice cold on a hot day. 

MEATS 

Use oven for baking and boiling and then cook your 
meats in the old-fashioned English way by direct con- 
tact with the flame. This means that you must first place 
one quart of water and one tablespoon of salt in the 
broiler pan of the gas range ; then place in the roast, steak 
or chops, upon the broiler ; turn every few minutes. The 
roast must be placed farther froni the flame to prevent 
burning. A good rule for this is to keep roasting meat 
four inches from the flame, steaks and chops two and 
one-half inches and fish three inches. 



126 MODERN COOKING 

The placing of water in the broiler pan prevents fat 
from catching fire. This liquid may be allowed to cool 
and then the fat may be removed and clarified and used 
for other purposes. Baste roast with one pint of boiling 
water while cooking. 

ROASTING AND BAKING MEATS 

Roasting or grilling is done before open fire, the meat 
being turned frequently, so that all sides may be cooked 
alike. The meat is basted with its own fat. This method 
of cooking meat is used daily in Europe, but not much 
used in this country. 

When a piece of meat is large it is roasted. Meat 
cooked in an oven by radiated heat is frequently called in 
this country "roasting." It is well known and needs 
little description. When baking meat always use a wire 
rack to lift the meat from the bottom of the pan. This 
will insure even cooking. 

Use the broiling oven in the gas range for roasting, 
placing rack sufficiently low. Have the oven hot enough 
to brown the meat quickly, then reduce the heat so that 
it will cook evenly; turn the roast three times during this 
process. 

Allow one-half an hour after placing meat in the oven 
before counting time. This is necessary so that the meat 
may reach the required temperature to start cooking. 

To bake (oven roast) use same process, using regular 
oven. 

Start counting time after meat is one-half hour in oven 
and allow twelve minutes to the pound for very rare, 
fifteen minutes for rare, eighteen minutes for medium 
and twenty for well done. 

Baste the meat with the liquid in the pan every fifteen 
minutes. Do not add seasoning to the meat while cook- 
ing. It is a well-known fact that salt will cause the juices 
and flavoring of the meat to dissolve and therefore be-

come lost. Season steaks and chops just before serving. 
Season roasts five minutes before removing from the 
oven. Always make the gravy after removing the meat 
from the pan. 

Note. — Never dish meat on a cold platter. The con- 
tact of a cold dish with the hot meat will injure its deli- 
cate aroma. 

In many portions of France and England chops and 
steaks are served upon platters set over a bowl of hot 
water or a special fuel that can be burned in a container 
that holds the platter. When serving a large steak always 
have a cover of metal or another hot dish turned over 
the meat to prevent it chilling. 

CORRECT METHOD OF BOILING MEAT 

Place the meat in a saucepan of boiling water and then 
keep the water boiling rapidly for five minutes after the 
meat is added. Then place the saucepan in a position 
where it will cook just below the boiling point for the 
required length of time. Constant and rapid boiling will 
cause the albumen in the meat to harden; therefore, no 
amount of cooking afterward will soften the fibre. It 
will only cause the meat to fall apart without being tender. 

It is important to keep the saucepan closely covered. 
This will prevent the delicate aroma from evaporating. 

Braising : Meat is placed in a hot saucepan and turned 
quickly and frequently. It is cooked in its own juices in 
a closely covered saucepan. 

Steaming : Cooking meat by placing in steam bath or 
steamer. 

Grilling : Cooking meat over a hot fire on a grill made 
for the purpose. 

Broiling: A very hot fire is necessary for this mode 
of cooking meat. Only the choicest, tenderest, and most 
delicate cuts are suitable for cooking by this method. 
The strong heat instantly coagulates the albumen by sear- 



128 MODERN COOKING 

ing it, thus retaining all its juices and flavor. That this 
method may be successful it is very necessary that the 
meat be turned every few minutes. This also insures 
it being cooked evenly. 

Pan Broiling : This is another method of cooking the 
fine cuts of meats when it is not possible to broil them. 
Broiled meat is more healthful and also less wasteful 
than any other form of cooked meat. 

TO PAN BROIL 

Heat an iron frying pan red hot, then place in it the 
meat. Turn it constantly. 

TIME FOR ROASTING MEAT IN GAS BROILER 

Beef, eighteen minutes to the pound. 

Lamb and mutton, twenty-one minutes to the pound.

MUTTON 

Mutton is the dressed carcass of the full-grown sheep 
and is usually prime in animals from three to five years 
old. If any older than this it lacks flavor and is tough. 

The cuts of mutton and of lamb are the same, namely : 
The meat is divided into fore and hind quarters and then 
cut in the neck, shoulder, rack, breast, loin and leg. 

The shoulder and leg are used for roasting and may be 
boned and then filled and rolled. For choice rack, cut to 
the tenth rib as for the chops. Three ribs and the neck 
for stewing, meat pies, goulashes, etc. The loin for 
chops. 

The French and English have methods of cutting and 
cooking mutton and lamb that make these cuts delicious. 

CHOPS 

French chops : Cut two ribs from the rack. English 
chops : Cut two inches thick from the loin, including the 
kidney. 

TO COOK 

Trim the chops free from excess fat and then baste 
with the juice of one lemon. Place in a broiler and cook 
for ten minutes, turning them frequently.

to the pound, not counting the first half hour in which 
the meat starts to cook. Drain off the fat before making 
the gravy. 

Mutton and lamb chops may be used for frying pur- 
poses. It can be blended with equal amounts of ham, 
bacon, pork or beef fat. Save every bit of fat and use 
it for making soap. This fat makes a fine soft soap for 
scouring and cleaning.

two large ones. Then remove the apron pieces of the 
shell, like a plate under the eyes. Break the shell apart 
and remove the spongy lingers, sandbag and eggs, if any. 
Wash well. You now have white oval-shaped pieces of 
crab meat, that must be picked from its cells. Split with 
a silver knife and use an oyster fork to pick out the meat. 
This can be used for au gratin, a la King, ravigotte, 
deviled crabs, salads, croquettes and crab cakes.

APPETIZERS 

The appetizer is a small morsel of food served at the 
beginning of the meal, causes a free flow of digestive 
juice and thus helps the digestion. During the growing 
season these canapes may be scullions, served icy cold, 
radishes, cold and crisp and cut into thin pieces, but 
still left on the stem; well-cleaned, crisp, crinkly water- 
cress ; coleslaw, with celery ; coleslaw with green and red 
peppers or with scullions, or with bacon or ham nicely 
browned; or just a slice of full ripe tomato, spread with 
mayonnaise and dusted with grated cheese or paprika. 

Many housewives have the impression that the prepara- 
tion of the delicious accessories of the cosmopolitan meal 
is expensive. Well, I hardly need tell you that the French 
housewife is noted for her .thrift and that these dainty 



MODERN COOKING 146 

tidbits are frequently portions of leftovers from a meal, 
sometimes the scrapings of a saucepan or a tablespoon 
of meat, vegetables and gravy. 

Have you ever had just a small piece of fish left over, 
entirely too small to serve by itself? And rather than 
leave it on a plate or saucer to form an accumulation you 
think. "Well, I can't use it, so into the garbage it goes." 

Now this tablespoon or two of fish would have made 
you a few delicious canapes ; by flaking it and then putting 
it through a sieve. Place it on a platter and then add 

Two tablespoons of butter One tablespoon of grated 
One teaspoon of paprika onion 

One tablespoon of finely minced parsley 

Work to a smooth paste and then spread on a narro\y 
strip of toast. Garnish with a slice of hard-boiled egg. 

The canape, though it bears a foreign name, is not 
necessarily an expensive addition to the menu for the 
family, nor is it elaborate. This delectable morsel is 
rather dainty, delicate and used as an appetizer that helps 
to start and stimulate the digestive juices and thus cause 
them to flow freely for the digestion of the food. 

Canapes are usually served cold, on a plate covered 
with a doily ; the canape is placed on this. They need not 
all be alike ; the bread may be cut with various sandwich 
cutters or it may be cut into finger widths and then 
toasted lightly and spread with the prepared paste. 

Meat, chicken, cheese, nuts, olives, etc., may be used 
in place of the fish. If you have a spoonful or so of peas, 
beans, spinach, cauliflower or asparagus you may use it 
in place of the fish, thus making a vegetable canape. 
Try two canned pimentos in place of either meat or 
fish. 

EGG CUTLETS 

Make a cream sauce, using six level teaspoons of flour 
to one cup of milk. Dissolve the flour in the milk and

How to utilize and serve leftover food so there will be 
no actual waste has perplexed many young housewives, 
and as one woman writes me: "I try to keep down the 



148 MODERN COOKING 

leftovers, but every once in so often they jtist rise up 
and conquer me." 

Every housewife knows that, no matter how carefully 
she plans there is sure to be a small quantity of leftover 
meat, gravy or vegetables. And just what to do with 
them is almost a daily problem. Two essentials are 
necessary to successfully utilize leftovers: First, good 
seasoning; second, attractive appearancje. 

The French excel in serving leftovers because they so 
thoroughly understand the art of flavoring and seasoning. 
The French housewife knows very well that she may 
only have a pot au feu to serve to the family, but the 
family knows that the delicate, attractive manner in 
which the food is put on the table would appeal to the 
epicure, though the table is but a plain ash top, scoured 
to the whiteness of the snows. 

HOW TO PREPARE A FAGOT OF SOUP HERBS 

Place in separate piles : 

One branch of parsley One-half carrot, cut 

One-qtiarter leek lengthwise 

Two branches of thyme One bay leaf 

Tie in bunches and then dry thoroughly and place in a 
fruit jar until needed. 

FRENCH SEASONINGS 

Each housewife prepares her own seasonings from her 
garden. You know, she grows them in the garden, and 
as the leaves become abundant she picks them each day, 
dries them thoroughly, and then places them in separate 
containers. She prepares the fagots of soup herbs 
and has them ready for instant use. 

GARLIC 

Few American persons know of the garlic but as a 
rank, pungent flavor. To the foreigner garlic is as sweet 
tasting as the onion and its flavor delightful in food. 



MODERN COOKING 149 

Just that dash that it needs to give it zest. Separate a 
clump of garlic into cloves and then peel and place in a 
fruit jar. Now bring one pint of white wine vinegar 
to the scalding point and then pour it over the garlic. 
Place on the cover and set in a warm place for two days. 
Use this vinegar for seasoning gravies and use the garlic, 
cut into tiny bits the size of a pinhead, for flavoring. 

For serving, use individual ramekin casseroles, baking 
shells, and thus make for efficient and quick handling of 
the food, in which the food itself is presented in a most 
attractive way. A good blend of seasoning is most 
important, so I am going to give you a French house- 
wife's secret. Mince four medium-sized onions very 
fine, then place in a bowl and add 

Six tablespoons of salt marjoram 

Two teaspoons of paprika One-qttarter teaspoon of 

One-half teaspoon of sage 

thyme Pinch of cloves 

One-half teaspoon of sweet Pinch of allspice 

Rub together until thoroughly mixed and then put-in a 
warm dry place for twenty-four hours. Put through a 
fine sieve. Place in a bottle and use one teaspoon of this 
mixture in place of salt. 

The average housewife seldom thinks of using such 
herbs as sweet basil, sorrel, tarragon, leek and chervil, yet 
they give a delicious flavoring not only to soups, stews, 
ragouts and goulashes, but to made dishes. They can 
be grown in the kitchen garden. A good sauce is impor- 
tant, and not only increases the portion, but also gives 
it an attractive appearance. 

Leftover meats and vegetables may be turned into 
palatable food with just a little time and energy. The 
basis of all croquettes should be a good thick moulding 
sauce that wiUgive a product that is creamy and delicious 
to taste. 

Owing to the fact that croquettes and cutlets are usually 



150 MODERN COOKING 

fried in hot fat, it is not necessary to add either shorten- 
ing or butter to the cream sauce. 

The true secret to good croquettes or cutlets is to have 
the mixture rich and creamy. Mould into croquettes and 
then dip in flour and then in the egg mixture and finally 
roll in fine crumbs. Fry until golden brown in hot fat. 

How to make the foundation : 

Place in a saucepan: 

One cup of milk 

Seven level tablespoons of flour 

Stir to dissolve the flour and then bring to a boil. 
Cook slowly for five minutes and then add the flavoring 
and seasoning. Set aside to cool and then mould. Form 
into croquettes, roll in flour, dip in beaten egg and then 
roll in fine bread crumbs and fry until golden brown 
in hot fat. 

NUT AND PEPPER CROQUETTES 

Two green peppers Two medium-sized onions 

Mince very fine and then parboil and drain. Turn on a 

cloth and pat dry. Place in a bowl and add 

One cup of cream sauce. One teaspoon of salt 
made as given in the One teaspoon of paprika 

method Three tablespoons of 

One-half cup of finely grated cheese 

chopped nuts 
Mix thoroughly and then pour on a large platter and 

allow to cool, then finish as directed for cheese cro- 
quettes. 

LIMA BEAN CROQUETTES 

Wash and soak overnight three-quarters cup of baby 

lima beans. In the morning parboil until tender and then 

drain until very dry. Now put 

Two mediums-sized onions One green pepper 
Four pieces of bacon 



MODERN COOKING 161 

through a food chopper. Place in a pan and cook until 
the onions and peppers are soft. Drain free from fat 
and then put the beans through the food chopper and add : 

The prepared peppers and Two tablespoons of finely 

onions and bacon minced parsley 

One teaspoon of paprika One teaspoon of Worces- 
tershire sauce 

Mix thoroughly and then mould into croquettes and dip 
in flour, then in beaten &gg, and roll in fine bread crumbs. 
Fry until golden brown in hot fat. 

Leftover meat may be minced fine and seasoned as 
follows : 

Put a sufficient amount of cold cooked meat or fish 
through the food chopper to measure three-quarters cup 
and 

One large onion Four branches of parsley 

Place the mixture in a bowl and add 
One teaspoon of salt One teaspoon of paprika 

One cup of cream sauce 
made as directed in the method, then the finely chopped 
meat and one teaspoon of Worcestershire sauce. Mix 
thoroughly and then set aside to mould. Form into cro- 
quettes and roll in flour, dip in beaten egg and then roll in 
fine bread crumbs. Fry in hot fat. 

Cold beef, lamb, chicken, veal, ham or crab meat or 
fish may be used for this delectable method of serving an 
entree. Nuts, eggs, cheese, both cottage or pot, and store 
cheese, may be used. Dried peas, lima beans, navy and 
soy beans as well as cow peas and lentils will afford a 
splendid variety to the thrifty housewife who must pro- 
vide cheap protein dishes. 

The difference between a croquette and a cutlet is just 
in the shape. Croquettes are shaped either in the cylin- 
drical or conical forms and cutlets in flat, either round, 
triangle or chop shape. 



152 



MODERN COOKING 



To prepare the egg for dipping add four tablespoons 
of evaporated milk and beat hard to thoroughly blend. 
Place croquette or cutlet on wire spoon and use table- 
spoon to pour the beaten egg over the croquette. 

To prepare the crumbs dry all pieces of stale bread 
thoroughly. No bit is too small, a crust or even the 
crumbs left from cutting the bread. Put the well-dried 
bread through the food chopper and then sift through 
the colander; either put the coarse crumbs through the 
food chopper the second time or keep them for au gratin 
dishes. 

Always serve either cream or tomato sauce with cro- 
quettes and cutlets and garnish them with parsley or 
cress.

SAUCES 

A formula is necessary if the housewife is to have her 
sauces uniform, so that 

One level tablespoon of flour and one cup of milk make 
a thin sauce, as for soups. 



MODERN COOKING 161 

Two level tablespoons of flour and one cup of milk 
make a thin sauce. 

Three level tablespoons of flour and one cup of milk 
make a medium sauce. 

Four tablespoons of flour and one cup of milk make 
a thick sauce. 

Five level tablespoons of flour and one cup of milk 
make a sauce for cutlets, croquettes, etc. 

Use a saucepan that is scoured bright, add the flour to 
the cold milk and then stir to dissolve, using fork or wire 
whip to facilitate the process. Never use a spoon for 
this purpose, as it is impossible to thoroughly dissolve 
the lumps. Place on the fire and bring to a boil, stirring 
constantly. Cook for five minutes after the boiling point 
is reached and then remove from the fire and add season- 
ing. It is\then ready to use. If you desire a butter 
flavor, add one tablespoon ful of butter with the season- 
ing and stir until melted. 

Part milk and water, stock, chicken broth, oyster or 
clam juice may be used in place of all milk with very good 
results. When making soups or sauces for meat and 
vegetable dishes the liquid from the canned vegetables, 
or the water in which the fresh vegetables were cooked, 
may be combined with an equal portion of milk. 

Many splendid varieties of sauce can be made from the 
plain cream sauce. For parsley sauce add four table- 
spoons of finely chopped parsley to one cup of cream 
sauce.

In no other part of cookery does the skill of the cook 
show to advantage as in the way in which the various 
sauces are prepared and served. To make a perfect 
sauce is an art of cooking. Many plain foods, as well as 
the use of leftovers, may, by the addition of a good 
sauce, be turned into palatable and attractive dishes. 

Three or four cupfuls of cream sauce may be made at 
one time and then poured into a bowl and covered with a 
damp napkin, and placed in the icebox tuitil needed. The 
sauce will keep in a cool place for three or four days 
and will relieve the necessity of making a sauce every day. 

To use, measure three-quarters of a cupful of sauce 
and add one-quarter cupful of hot water. Place in a 
double boiler to heat, stirring frequently to blend. It is 
then ready to use. Always use a double boiler in the 
preparation of sauces made from this cream sauce. This 
will prevent scorching.

HOW TO PREPARE CHICKEN FOR CHICKEN 
SALAD OR COLD CUTS 

Singe and draw the chicken and then cut as for fricas- 
seeing. Now place the back of the carcass, giblets and 
the thighs and legs in a saucepan and cover with cold 
water. Bring to a boil and then turn into a colander 
and place under cold running water. Then drop into a 
saucepan containing boiling water and cook for ten 
minutes. Blanch in the colander under cold running 
water. Repeat this three times and then add the balance 
of the chicken and cook slowly until tender. Cool in the 
liquid. Pick the meat from the neck and back of the 
carcass and mince the giblets fine. Put the skin through 
the food chopper. Use this for chicken loaf.

pan in hot oven for fifteen minutes; now turn the fowl 
breast down in the pan and reduce the heat of the oven to 
moderate. Baste every ten minutes with following mix- 
ture: 

One pint boiling water Two tablespoons butter 

When fowl is tender turn on back to allow breast to 
brown, basting every five minutes. Placing the breast of 
the chicken down in the pan throws the bony structure of 
the carcass to the intense heat of the oven. The constant 
basting causes the moisture to permeate the dry white 
meat, making it juicy and tender. 

If you desire, lay a few strips of bacon over the breast 
when browning it, just before you remove it from oven. 
It will improve the flavor. 

CHICKEN SALAD SANDWICHES

FATS 

Fat is a heat- or fuel-producing food which is very 
valuable in cold weather for supplying the body with heat 
and energy. Often foods that are cooked in fat are 
termed indigestible; this means that the food is not 
utilized in the body and, owing to some digestive dis- 
turbances, it becomes part of the waste. Recent experi- 
ments tend to show that animal fats are assimilated fairly 
well; undoubtedly it is the misuse of fat that is used 
for frjring purposes that has given many fried foods 
their bad reputation. Every normal person requires a 
certain amount of fat. 



MODERN COOKING 179 

Make it a rule when serving fried food to have an acid 
food, either a vegetable or a garnish, accompany the dish. 

Here are just a few things to keep in mind when plan- 
ning to serve fried foods: Use very small quantities 
of foods that are cooked in fat for people occupying 
sedentary positions, while those who are employed in 
active or laboribus work may eat a larger proportion. 
Persons who are working at hard manual labor, out of 
doors, will be able to assimilate daily portions of fried 
food without any physical disturbances. 

For digestion's sake, learn to serve : 

Juice of lemon with fried Cranberry or currant jelly 
fish with poultry, lamb or 

Apple sauce with pork or mutton 

goose Horseradish with beef 

It is a curious thing that nature demands these com- 
binations to equalize the fatty content of the meal. Save 
and clarify the various fats and utilize each paticular 
kind, so that there need be no waste. Chop all bits of 
suet fine and place in a double boiler and then render. 
Chicken and pork fat may be rendered in this way. 

An excellent shortening that may be used to replace 
butter in cooking and baking may the made from chicken 
fat, of which there is usually three or more ounces in one 
fat bird. Remove the fat from the bird and place in cold 
salt water for one hour and then drain and cut into smalt 
pieces. Render in a double boiler. Pour into a jar and 
allow to harden. Now, when using this fat, use one- 
third less than the amount called for in the recipe. To 
make pastry, allow four tablespoon fuls of this chicken 
fat to each cup of flour. Chicken fat may be used to 
replace butter for seasoning vegetables and mashed 
potatoes. This is a pure fat free from moisture and 
seasoning and will go farther than butter. 

Generally, in speaking of the term "drippings," it 
meant to include fats that cook out from the roast beef. 



180 MODERN COOKING 

pot roast, soups and corned beef. This fat is clarified 
and then used for sauteing. It cannot be used with good 
results for making pastry and cakes. 

To clarify fat : Put the fat in a saucepan and add one 
cupful of cold water to every pound of fat. Add 

One-fourth teaspoon of bicarbonate of soda 
One-half teaspoon of salt 

Bring to a boil and then simmer slowly for ten minutes. 
Pour through a strainer lined with cheesecloth and allow 
to harden, then cut into pieces. Reheat and pour into 
jars. Bacon, sausage and ham fats may be blended with 
beef drippings for frying purposes. 

Mutton or lamb fat must be clarified and then blended 
with ham and bacon or sausage fat. Fat from bacon, 
ham and sausages may be used for flavoring vegetables 
in place of butter, for cooking omelets, potato cakes, 
mush and scrapple. It is a splendid seasoning to use for 
macaroni, baked beans with tomato sauce, dried beans and 
peas in soups and when cooking dried lima beans. There 
is really no need to allow a spoonful of these fats to be 
wasted. Fats that are not available for table use should 
be collected and made into soap. 

Do not be falsely economical in trying to do deep 
frying with these fats. They not only will not hold the 
temperature for successful frying without scorching, but 
they frequently soak into the food and make it unfit to 
eat. 

The late war has brought many good vegetable oils 
upon the market that are ideal for cooking purposes and 
are preferable to the animal fats for all cooking. They 
not only hold a high temperature without burning, but 
also they may be used repeatedly if they are strained each 
time after using. Food cooked in vegetable oil does not 
absorb the fat and it is more digestible and really more 
economical. 



MODERN COOKING 181 

FRYING 

There are two methods of frying : 

First. — Sauteing— -cooking food in the pan with just 
sufficient fat to prevent scorching. This method is com- 
monly used, but has nothing to really recommend it, as the 
food absorbs quantities of grease. This makes it difficult 
to digest. 

Second. — ^Deep-fat frying — it is usual to dip the food 
to be fried in a mixture to coat it and then to roll it in fine 
bread crumbs and then cook in sufficient fat to cover. 
This forms an air-tight cover that prevents the grease 
from soaking through. A few essential utensils are nec- 
essary to produce successful results ; first, a heavy kettle 
that w^ill not tilt, and second, a frying basket, so that the 
food may be removed quickly when cooked. 

The correct temperature for deep-fat frying is 350 
degrees Fahrenheit, for raw foods, such as crullers, fish, 
fritters, potatoes, etc. For cooked dishes and oysters, 
cheeseballs, etc., 370 degrees Fahrenheit. 

Do not attempt to cook large quantities at one time. 
This will cause a sudden drop in the temperature of the 
fat, allowing it to permeate the food which is cooking 
and thus give a greasy product. 

Now for a word of protection. Do not use too large a 
kettle. Keep a bucket of sand handy in the kitchen, 
and if for any reason the fat catches fire, throw sand on 
it; do not attempt to remove it from the stove; serious 
burns are apt to result. Just turn out the light and throw 
sand on the fire. Keep the fact in mind that water 
spreads the flames ; if no sand is at hand, use salt or flour.

ARTICHOKES 

The artichoke is a plant closely resembling the thistle, 
and it is extensively cultivated for its flowering head. 
The head is gathered just before the flower expands. 
The eatable portion is the fleshy part of the calyx, the 
bottom or basin of the blossom and the true base of the 
leaves of the flower. 

The flesh of the artichokes correspond closely to that 
which the old world folks call the cheese of the thistle. 
On the Continent, in Europe, the artichoke is frequently 
served raw, as a salad, with either French or Parisian 
dressing. Undei: ordinary circumstances the fruit as 
prepared for market will keep several weeks. The canned 
artichoke, which was imported quite extensively before 
the war, consisted of the fronds and bottoms. ' It came 
in large quantities from both France and Italy. 

The artichoke buds are used exclusively for garnishing. 

THE JERUSALEM ARTICHOKE 

This kind of artichoke is a tuber of the species of the 
sunflower; it resembles somewhat the Irish potato. It 
has a sweetish flavor and contains a large amount of 
natural water. This species of artichoke is more valu- 
able than the common artichoke. 

The two principal types of the Jerusalem artichokes 
are 

First: Long with reddish skin, 

Second: Round, knobby and white in color. 

On the Continent they are frequently eaten raw, with 
just a plain seasoning of salt, pepper and vinegar; in 
fact, much as we eat the American radish. They are 
frequently made into soup. 

The word Jerusalem is a queer cross of dialect from 
the Italian word girasole, meaning sunflower.

FISH 

Fish are divided into two classes — those having back- 
bones, which are called vertebrates ; and those which have 
no backbones, and are called shellfish. 

The vertebrates are classified as fresh and salt-water 
fish, and they contain both white and dark meat. Fish 
is similar to meat in composition and structure and is 
classed among the protein or body-building foods ; it may 
replace meat or its equivalent on the menu. 

The muscle consists of a bundle of fibers, bound to- 
gether by a connective tissue; it is so tender that it re- 
quires much less time to cook than meat. Fish, as a 
rule, contains less fat than meat; and while there is con- 
siderable refuse, it will be found to be about equal to the 
bone in meat. 

The methods of cooking fish are : Broiling, boiling, 
baking, deep fat frying and sauteing.

SOUP 

Soup, unless it is a thick cream or puree, contains little 
food value. Rather, it is stimulating to the stomach and 
causes a free flow of the digestive juices. Thus the food 
taken in after the soup has stimulated the stomach is 
quickly absorbed and thus gives the body immediate 
nourishment without distressing the digestion. 

The French lay great stress upon two essentials in 
making soup successfully. First, it must not go below 
the boiling point, just a gentle bubbling, and, second, 
after once started, no water should be added. In making 
soup always use cold water to start with. Do not use 
salt or any seasoning, and heat slowly, keeping the pot 
closely covered. 

Protein, which is the chief constituent of meat, is 
drawn into the liquid, making it very nutritious. Rapid 
boiling destroys the fine aroma and volatile oils, which 
escape in the steam. 

Soups are divided into three classes : First, stock ; 
second, cream ; third, fruit soups. 

Soups made from meat and bone are called stock; 
those without stock are called cream, such as cream vege- 
table, clam and oyster soups, and, lastly, those made from 
meat and bones, cooked by long and slow boiling, which 
dissolves the soluble elements of the meat and bones into 
the water and makes a very rich soup. 

THE STOCK POT 

This should be a deep pot or kettle with a tight-fitting 
lid. This is important, so that none of the steam may 
be lost by evaporation. The steam contains the aroma or 
fine volatile oil and essentials which pass into the air. 
In a fairly large family little meat need be purchased for 
the stock pot if the housewife insists that all portions. 



202 MODERN COOKING 

of bone and trimming be sent with the purchased meat. 
The French women look with horror on the American 
women leaving all the scrap and trimming to the butcher. 

TO MAKE THE STOCK 

A soup bone from the shin beef, which is full of nutri- 
ment, will have nearly one-half pound of meat on it. 
Take one pound of the scrag end of the neck of veal and 
four quarts of water. Wash the bones and add the cold 
water and bring slowly to a boil. Skim and then cover 
closely and cook for four hours. By this time the meat 
will have fallen from the bones. Strain and set aside to 
cool. Let stand overnight. This is best. 

Then remove all fat from the top. This stock is the 
basis of all soups, sauces and gravies. It is rich in mineral 
matter and gelatine. The meat can be taken from the 
bones and run through the food chopper and used for 
meat loaf, croquettes and meat biscuits or sausage, and 
it will make mighty tasty hash when combined with po- 
tatoes and onions for breakfast. 

You now have a delicious and nutritious broth, without 
seasoning of any kind, which will keep in cold weather 
four or five days. In warm weather it must be returned 
every second day to the pot, brought to a boil and 
skimmed and then left to cool and finally put in the ice 
box. Small portions of meat, ham, any trimming and 
bones that have accumulated may be added. Chicken 
feet, scalded in boiling water to loosen the outer skin, 
which must be peeled off, together with the giblets of 
fowl, may be added to the stock pot. Seasoning and the 
addition of vegetables cause it to sour. Many varieties 
of soup are possible with the use of this stock. 

OYSTER GUMBO 

Mince two medium-sized onicms very fine and then 
place in a saucepan and add 



MODERN COOKING 203 

One pint of hot water One pint of oyster liquid 

One pint of milk 

Bring to a boil and cook for five minutes. Now add 

One-half cup of flour dissolved in 
One-half cup of milk 

Stir well until it reaches the boiling point, and then add 

Twenty-five oysters 

One tablespoon of file (gumbo powder) 

One ounce of butter 

Cook for five minutes and then pour the gumbo into a 
tureen and add three tablespoons of finely chopped 
parsley. File, or gumbo powder, is made by the Choctaw 
Indians from young sassafras leaves. The Indians 
gather the leaves, spread them upon the bark to dry and 
then grind them into a fine powder, put it through a fine 
sieve and then pack it into pouches or jars. It is sold 
in the French markets in New Orleans and in all high- 
class importing groceries. The Indians use the sassafras 
both medicinally and in cookery, and the Creoles quickly 
discovered this and appreciated it when making their 
famous gumbo or file. 

VEGETABLE SOUP 

One pint of stock, one cup of tomato pulp, made by 
scalding the peeling of tomatoes, or the canned tomatoes, 
may be used, and 

One-half cup of diced One-half carrot cut in dice 

potatoes One tablespoon of parsley 

One-half cup of mixed Two tablespoons of flour 

vegetables ; cabbage. Salt and pepper to taste 

turnips and peas, may be Portion of bunch of 
added potherbs

the vegetable soup. Put the remainder of the herbs in 
a fruit jar until needed again. 

Put the herbs in the stock, add the tomatoes and let 
simmer. Cook the vegetables in one pint of water until 
tender and then add water and all to the stock and add the 
seasoning and flour, mixed with a little cold water, and 
cook for five minutes. 

TO MAKE NOODLES 

One egg One tablespoon of water 

One-half teaspoon of salt 

Beat together until well mixed and then add sufficient 
flour to make a stiff dough. Knead until elastic — about 
two minutes — and then roll out on a pastry board until 
as thin as paper, dusting the board lightly with flour to 
prevent sticking. Permit it to stand for fifteen minutes 
to dry and then cut into strings, thick and thin. Do 
this by rolling up loosely, like a jelly roll, and then cut. 
Lay on a dish to dry. When thoroughly dry they may 
be kept in a fruit jar. Part of the paste may be stamped 
with small vegetable cutters and cooked in the soup same 
as the noodles. 

Vegetables cut in fancy shapes, macaroni cut in small 
rings, hard-boiled eggs in slices, cheese balls, slices of 
lemon, also rice and barley, may be added to the soup. 

To make brown coloring: One-half cup of sugar 
cooked ten minutes in an iron pan until burned black; 
then add one-half cupful of water. Let come to a boil 
and then strain and bottle for use. 

The principal points to keep in mind when making 
soup are : 

First, draw out all of the juice and soluble flavors into 
the water. 

Second, retain that which we have drawn out by using 
a pot with a tight-fitting lid. 



MODERN COOKING 205 

Third, use cold water with which to extract meat juices 
and flavors. 

Fourth, long, slow cooking. 

Fifth, flavoring and vegetables added after making 
stock prevent its souring quickly. 

Sixth, do not use stock pot for other than it is intended. 
Care and accurate judgment and measuring will give 
successful results. 

If most of the work is done in the morning while at- 
tending to the kitchen duties, the stock-making will take 
little of your time. Delicious gravies may be made by 
using stock instead of water. 

CLEAR SOUP 

Use two tablespoons of fat and fry one onion until 
brown. Add two tablespoons of flour and brown well and 
then pour in one pint of stock and cook for five minutes, 
and then add seasoning, salt and pepper to taste. Strain 
into a soup tureen and sprinkle with one tablespoon of 
finely chopped parsley. Serve with bread cut in finger 
lengths and toasted. 

CELERY PUREE 

Use one pint of diced celery and cook in one cup of 
cold water until tender and then put through a sieve and 
add 

One cup of stock Salt and pepper 

One cup of milk One tablespoon of chopped 

Two tablespoons of flour parsley and serve 

mixed with a little milk

To the clear soup may be added macaroni, noodles or 
any vegetables. This is a good way to use left-over 
portions of vegetables that are too small to serve alone.

this the soup. Garnish with finely chopped parsley and 
one tablespoon of grated cheese. 

FISH SOUPS 

The bouillabaisse of France and New Orleans is most 
delectable and may well be served upon our tables fre- 
quently. The French and our Southern cooking, espe- 
cially the Creoles, excel in the preparation of delicious 
cream soups and purees. They are made entirely from 
vegetables. These good folk have preserved an old-world 
custom; namely, the daily plate of soup. The Creoles 
have introduced a new variety of their own called gumbo. 

Vegetables and milk are the basis for these soups. 
The vegetables are cooked in water and then rubbed 
through a sieve. Equal parts of milk are added and then 
thickened slightly and seasoned. When it is desired to 
give additional food value, eggs may be added.

OYSTER BROTH 

Drain twenty-four oysters, saving the liquid. Wash 
and carefully look over the oysters to free from bits of 
shell. Chop fine and place in saucepan and measure the 
oyster liquid, adding sufficient water to make two cups. 
Simmer slowly for fifteen minutes. Let boil up once. 
Strain, season to taste with salt, pepper and then the broth 
is ready to serve. Equally good hot or cold.

CELERY SOUP 

Wash and thoroughly cleanse the celery and then chop 
fine. Place one pint of finely chopped celery in a sauce- 
pan and add three cups of cold water. Bring to a boil 
and cook until the celery is very soft. Rub through a fine 
sieve and then measure, and add 

One cup of milk Two tablespoons of flour 

to every cup of the celery puree. Dissolve the flour in 
cold milk and then add the celery puree. Bring to a boil 
and cook for ten minutes. Season, adding one teaspoon 
of butter for flavoring. A fagot of soup herbs may be 
added to the celery if desired. 

CREAM SOUPS 

Cream soups are a combination of vegetables, puree 
and milk. Almost all of the green vegetables will make 
delicious soups. Clean the vegetables well and then cut 
into small pieces. Place in a saucepan and cover with 
cold water and bring to a boil. Cook slowly until tender 
and then mash well ; then rub through a fine sieve. Use 
this vegetable stock with equal parts of milk to make the 
soup. 

Carrots, pe?.s, tomatoes, turnips, corn, beans, celery, 
lettuce, potatoes, beets, cucumbers, asparagus, all these 
afford a splendid variety. 

Allow one level tablespoon of flour for thickening and 
dissolve the flour in cold water before adding. Bring 
quickly to a boil and then season. Add two tablespoons 
of butter for flavoring and then serve. 

French, Swiss and Italians serve grated cheese and 
paprika with all cream soups. 

CREAM OF ONION 

Place two cups of thinly sliced onions in a saucepan 
and add one cup of cold water. Cook until soft and then 
rub through a fine sieve. Measure and return to the 



210 MODERN COOKING 

saucepan, and add one cup of milk for every cup of 
onion puree and two level tablespoons of flour to every 
cup of milk. Stir to dissolve the flour, then bring to a 
boil and cook slowly for five minutes. Season, using salt 
and white pepper. Serve, then add one tablespoon of 
butter to every quart of cream soup. Croutons or toasted 
strips of bread make a delicious accompaniment to cream 
soups. 

How to prepare croutons : Cut slices of bread into one- 
inch blocks and place in a baking sheet and bake until 
golden brown. Place in a tin box or jar and seal. When 
ready to use just reheat to crisp and then serve. Stale 
bread may be used for this purpose.

Note. — ^This dish may be cooked upon the top of the 
stove in a saucepan. 

DRIED FRUIT 

Oranges and grapefruit are high-priced and the dried 
fruits may be substituted to advantage. If these fruits 
are nicely prepared, the family will hardly be able to dis- 
tinguish between them and the fresh fruit. 

Frequently the dried fruits are so prepared that they 
are anything but inviting. Much will depend upon the 
selection of these fruits. Purchase only the best grade. 
This fruit should be bright and waxy and not too dry. 
Soak for fifteen minutes in warm water ; this loosens the 
dirt before washing. Now wash in plenty of water. 
Cover with water and allow to stand until the fruit has 
plumped out ; each piece of fruit will only absorb just the 
amount of moisture as it originally contained. 

This will require from six to twelve hours, depending 
entirely upon the dryness of the fruit. Be sure that the 
water covers the fruit at least one inch. Now, when the 
fruit is ready, add sugar to sweeten and place in the stove 
to cook. The slower this fruit is cooked the better. Re- 
member that hard, rapid cooking not only spoils dried 
fruits, but fresh fruit as well. 



MODERN COOKING 216 

When cooked tender, drain the liquid from the fruit 
and measure. Allow one-half cup of sugar to every three 
cups of juice. Place this juice and the sugar in a sep- 
arate saucepan and boil until thick; then pour over the 
fruit. 

Dried fruits prepared this way will be found to be de- 
licious. Apricots will require very little cooking, so drain 
them free from the liquid in which they are soaked and 
add the sugar. Boil the syrup until thick and then pour 
over the apricots and cook gently for ten minutes. 

Remove the skins from peaches, after soaking them, 
and before cooking add a little piece of thin orange peel 
for flavor. 

To prepare dried pears soak them for twelve hours and 
then place in a casserole dish and add to one-half pound 
of fruit 

One cup of brown sugar Juice of one lemon 

One cup of raisins 

Cover the casserole dish and bake slowly. 
STEWED PEARS 

Three-quarters cup of Six cloves 

syrup Piece of cinnamon and 

One-half cup of water piece of lemon peel 

Peel and then cook slowly until tender, chill and serve. 
CHICKEN AND GREEN PEPPER SANDWICHES

One-quarter teaspoon of paprika 

mustard Two tablespoons of melted 

butter 

Mix well and then spread between thin slices of but- 
tered bread.

One cup of chopped onion The prepared bread 
One green pepper, chopped Three tablespoons of finely 
fine chopped parsley 

One level teaspoon of thyme 

Cook slowly, turning frequently until the onions are 
tender, adding more shortening if necessary to prevent 
the mixture from sticking to the pan. Then season with 
salt and pepper. Cook and then fill into the duck. Dust 
with flour and then roast in a moderate oven, allowing 
thirty minutes for the duck to start cooking and twenty 
minutes to the pound. 

MACARONI 

Macaroni is to the Italian cook the starchy content of 
the meal; just as the Irish and sweet potato are our com- 
mon starchy foods. The thrifty Italian and French 
housewives have found that by addition of meat, cheese 
and eggs for flavoring, they can serve their families sub- 
stantial and attractive foods at a minimum cost. 

The average American consumer of pastes and maca- 
roni has no idea of the number of styles or forms — of 
which there are over a hundred — into which this wheat 
product is made. They range from the lasagnes, which 
are the short, flat pieces one and two inches wide, cut and 
frequently moulded by hand, to the Adeline, which are the 
long, thin threads, the finest of which are many times 
smaller than vermicelli. Between these two extremes 



MODERN COOKING 219 

there is a great variety, which includes the alphabet and 
many fancy designs. 

MACARONI MILIEUSE 

Wipe with damp cloth and cut in one-inch blocks one 
pound of shin beef. Roll in flour and brown quickly in 
hot fat. Place in a deep saucepan and add 
Three pints of cold water Two onions cut fine 
One medium-sized carrot cut in dice 

Bring to a boil and cook gently until the meat is tender. 
Now add 

One-half cup of tomato One and one-half tea- 

aux fine herbes spoons of paprika 

Two teaspoons of salt Six ounces of prepared 

macaroni 
Bring this mixture to a boil and then cook until the 
macaroni is well heated. Pour on a large platter and gar- 
nish with finely chopped parsley. 

TO PREPARE MACARONI 

The macaroni may be broken into pieces one and one- 
half inches long, or it may be cooked whole. In all re- 
cipes the macaroni must first be prepared as follows : 

Grease the bottom of a deep saucepan and then add 
two quarts of boiling water. Let boil for two minutes 
and then add the macaroni. Stir for a few minutes and 
then cook for fifteen minutes. Turn into a colander and 
drain. Then blanch under the running cold water for 
three minutes. Let drain. It is now ready to use in any 
number of ways. Greasing the saucepan prevents the 
macaroni from sticking to the bottom, while it is cooking. 

The Italian prepares a seasoning as follows : 
Wash two leeks Two green or red peppers 

Six branches of parsley Four branches of celery 

Pare 
Six onions Tiny bit of garlic 



220 MODERN COOKING 

Place in a chopping bowl and chop very fine. Now 
place in one-half cup of vegetable cooking oil in a sauce- 
pan and add the vegetables. Cook slowly until soft and 
then add one small can of tomato paste. Blend well and 
then pour in a bowl or jar and set in a cool place. This 
mixture will keep in the refrigerator or in a cool place 
for one week in summer time and from ten to twelve 
days in winter. This mixture is called tomato aux fine 
herbes. 

Small portions of meat that would be insufficient to 
serve alone can be utilized in making these dishes. When 
making gravy, prepare enough so that a cup or more may 
be set aside to use in the macaroni dishes. Bones, gristle 
and meat joints left on the serving platter may all be 
made into stock, from which the various gravies can be 
made. The ItaHan cook uses a small piece of meat for 
flavoring, usually chopping it in small pieces. 

MACARONI CUSTARD 
Place in a saucepan 

Two cups of milk Six level tablespoons of 

One and one-half cups of cornstarch 

water 

Dissolve the starch in the water and add the milk. 
Bring to a boil and cook for five minutes. Remove from 
the fire and add 

Yolks of two eggs One cup of sugar 

One and one-half teaspoons of vanilla 

Beat to mix and then pour over six ounces of maca- 
roni prepared as given in the method for preparation. 
Add one-half cup of raisins and then bake in a moderate 
oven for twenty-five minutes. Place the whites of two 
eggs in a bowl and add one glass of jelly. Beat until the 
mixture holds its shape; then pile on top of pudding. 



MODERN COOKING 221 

MACARONI AU GRATIN 

Cook one-half pound of macaroni as given in the 
method of preparing. Place in a baking dish and then 
make three cups of cream sauce, using 

One and one-half cups of One and one-half cups of 
milk clear stock 

One-half cup of flour 

Blend well and then pour over the macaroni. Sprinkle 
the top with fine bread crumbs and grated cheese and 
bake in a moderate oven for twenty-five minutes. 

POTATOES 

This nutritious tuber is said to have saved the Irish 
people from famine, and it is fitting that this variety of 
potato should bear that name. The potato was unknown 
to Europe before the venturesome expedition of the fif- 
teenth century to the Americas, where it was found to be 
used freely by the natives of both continents. 

Frequently it has been said that the potato competes 
with bread as the staff of life, because its use is almost 
universal. There are more than thirty-five varieties of 
potato and although it is affected by soil and climate, the 
sandy soil necessary for its successful growth is found in 
almost every country. 

The housewife should understand its food value. The 
average analysis of the white potato is as follows : 

Sixty-two per cent, water, 2 per cent, protein, 1 per 
cent, fat, 4 per cent, carbohydrates (starch and sugar), 
20 per cent, waste and 1 per cent, mineral ash. 

The proportion of water found in the potato depends 
largely upon the soil in which it is grown. The small 
protein content is offset by its large carbohydrates (starch 
and sugar) content. 

POTATO CAKES 

Cook three large potatoes and then peel and mash fine. 



222 MODERN COOKING 

Measure and place two cups of mashed potatoes in a mix- 
ing bowl and add 

Two cups of flour powder 

One teaspoon of salt One egg 

Four teaspoons of baking Four tablespoons of milk 

Mix to a smooth dough and then roll out one-half inch 
thick and cut and brush the tops with milk. Bake in a 
hot oven for eighteen minutes. 

POTOATO DISHES 

One of the best forms of serving this tuber is to roast 
the potato in the ashes. Few will realize how delicious it 
can be. Wrap the potato in wax paper and then cover 
with coals and roast about one hour. 

Next to this method comes the baked potato. Wash 
and dry medium-sized potatoes and then rub well with 
shortening and place in the oven and bake for thirty-five 
minutes for small potatoes and fifty minutes to one hour 
for large ones. Greasing the potato well before baking 
prevents a hard crust from forming and permits the en- 
tire contents of the mealy sack to be eaten. 

Boiling potatoes in their jackets causes the potato to 
lose about 2 per cent, of its nutritive value, while peeling 
before cooking causes a loss of 14 per cent. If necessary 
to peel, use a sharp knife and remove the very thinnest 
portion of the skin; scraping new potatoes is better than 
peeling them. 

O'BRIEN POTATOES 

Pare and then cut in thin slices five potatoes that have 
been boiled in their jackets. Mince sufficient onions, fine, 
to measure three-quarters of a cup. Chop fine two green 
peppers. Parboil onions and peppers until tender and 
then drain well. Now heat three tablespoons of shorten- 
ing in a frying pan until very hot and then add the pota- 
toes and let brown. Fold over and brown again. Keep 
turning over until the potatoes are well browned and then 



MODERN COOKING 223 

add the prepared onions and peppers. Cook slowly for 
five minutes and then turn on a hot platter and garnish 
with finely chopped parsley. 

BOILED POTATOES 

To cook potatoes, either in jackets or pared: Cover 
with boiling water, cook until tender. Season ; now cover 
closely with clean cloth to absorb moisture and the potato 
will be mealy. 

GRILLED POTATOES 

Wash and pare large old potatoes and then cut into 
thin slices, cutting the full width of the potato. This 
means that you are to cut a thin slice of raw potato that 
will cover your hand. Place on a shallow baking dish 
and brush with shortening. Place in the broiler and broil 
until nicely browned, then place in the oven for five 
minutes. 

MOUNTAIN BUTTERMILK RYE MUFFINS 

Place in a mixing bowl 

One and one-half cups of Four tablespoons of 

buttermilk shortening 

One teaspoon of baking Six tablespoons of syrup 

soda 

One egg 

Beat to mix and then add 

Two and one-half cups of One teaspoon of baking 
rye flour powder 

Beat to thoroughly mix and then pour into well-greased 
and floured muffin pans, and bake for thirty minutes in a 
moderate oven. When cold the muffins that are left over 
may be split and toasted and then spread with mountain 
sweet-spiced jam.

IF NECESSARY TO KEEP MEAT THREE OR 
FOUR DAYS 

Much sickness that is described as ptomaine poisoning 
is usually caused by carelessness. If for any reason meat 
must be kept several days after it is purchased, it may be 
cared for in the following manner : 

Place 

Three-quarters cup of salt in a saucepan 

And add 

Three and one-half cups of One-half teaspoon of 

water saltpeter 

One bay leaf 

Bring to a boil and cool. Place the meat in a china 
bowl or a wooden bucket and pour the brine over it. 
Now place a plate on top of the meat and weigh down 
with an old flatiron and heavy stone. Turn the meat 
every other day. 

This meat will keep for one week. This method is 
suitable for mutton, beef or pork. For lamb or chicken 
place in a saucepan and add 

One-half carrot One onion 

Sufficient boiling water to partially cover same 

Cook, keeping pan closely covered, for ten minutes to 
the pound. Cool before placing in the ice box. If it is 
necessary to keep the meat only until the next day, mince 
fine two onions and add 

Four tablespoons of salt One tablespoon of pepper 

Mix thoroughly and then rub the meat thoroughly with 
this mixture. Meat may be kept in the ordinary ice box 
that holds seventy-five pounds of ice for two days in the 
hottest weather in the following manner : Wipe the meat 
with a dry cloth and cover with a wax or parchment 
paper, and then hang from a hook in the lower part of 



MODERN COOKING 225 

the refrigerator, directly under the ice chamber if pos- 
sible. The hooks are shaped like the letter S, sharply 
pointed at both ends and they may be purchased or made 
by any hardware dealer. 

Meat allowed to lie on a platter soon loses its nutritious 
qualities with the escaping of the juices. 

FILLET OF BEEF 

Have the butcher trim the fillet into shape and then 
lard it with salt pork. Dust lightly with flour and then 
place on a rack in the roasting pan and place in a hot 
oven, basting every ten minutes. Cook, allowing the 
meat one-half hour to become thoroughly heated and to 
start cooking ; then allow twelve minutes for every pound. 
This cut is the choicest of the entire cattle and is without 
a single ounce of waste. It is delicious either hot or cold. 

WELSH CHEESE PUDDING 

Five ounces of grated One teaspoon of paprika 

cheese One tablespoon of 

One cup of bread crumbs Worcestershire sauce 

One cup of flour One tablespoon of baking 

One and one-half tea- powder 

spoons of salt Four tablespoons of grated

pepper One egg 
One cup of milk 

Beat to thoroughly mix and then pour in moulds or 
prepared pudding cloth and boil for one and three- 
quarters hours. Serve either hot or cold. To serve hot, 
use the following sauce : 

Place in a saucepan 

One cup of milk 

Two tablespoons of cornstarch 

Dissolve the starch in the milk and bring to a boil. 
Cook for five minutes and then add 



226 MODERN COOKING 

One well-beaten egg Two teaspoons of paprika

Beat hard to mix and then serve. This dish will re- 
place meat and be sufficient for a family of four or five. 

MEAL PUDDING 

Place one quart of milk in a saucepan and bring to a

HOW TO COOK CORN BEEF 

Wash the beef in cold water and then place in a sauce- 
pan and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and turn 
into a colander, and let cold water run on the meat. Place 
a saucepan on the stove and fill with boiling water, and 
add 

One carrot, cut in dice One bay leaf and 

Two onions, with one clove The meat 

stuck in each onion 

Bring to a boil and cook slowly, allowing the meat to 
cook thirty minutes to start and then twenty minutes to 
the pound, gross weight. Then remove the saucepan 
from the fire when the meat is cooked and allow the 
meat to cool in the liquid, with the lid removed. When 
cool, remove and place at once in the ice box. Serve cold. 

Mutton may be corned like beef. The shoulder makes 
a delicious economical cut. Have the butcher bone the 
meat, but do not roll. Put in a pickle for six days. Re- 
move and wash and then tie securely, and cook in the 
same manner as for corned beef.

MINCEMEAT 

During the Xmas holidays open house was kept by the 
barons and knights of the early days. Great festivities 
and merrymaking was the order of the time. The great 
fete took place on Xmas day. On that day the mistresses 
of the households vied with each other in a friendly 
rivalry with their dishes of mutton pie. 

The mutton pie, as it was known in 1596, is the mince 
pie of to-day. It was also known by the name of Xmas 
pie or shredds. In Herrick's time it was considered 
vitally important to put an armed guard to watch the 
Xmas pies, lest some sweet-toothed rascal purloin them 
and then there would be no pies to grace the feast. As 



MODERN COOKING

ever in warring lands, food commodities were scarce and 
expensive and accordingly considered a great luxury.

EGGS 

The similarity in the proportion of the shell, yolk and 
white of Qgg in the chicken eggs is that the shell aver- 
ages about one-tenth, the yolk about three-fourths and 
the white about four-tenths. The shell alone is counted 
as waste. The white contains about six-eighths water, 
the solids of the white are virtually all nitrogeneous mat- 
ter or protein. The yolk contains about one-half water 
and one-third fat, and the balance is of nitrogenous mat- 
ter or protein. 

Newly laid or fresh eggs have a semi-transparent uni- 
form, pale pinkish tint ; the shell contains a very small air 
chamber, which separates the skin and shell of the egg 
and is filled with air. This chamber increases with the 
age of the egg. 

Eggs when cooked at a low temperature are delicate 
and easy to digest, and they can be used for invalids, and 
persons with a delicate digestion. 



240 MODERN COOKING 

HOW TO COOK EGGS 

Eggs boiled are eggs spoiled; the physician tells us 
that hard-boiled eggs require three and a half hours to 
digest. Keep this in mind when cooking eggs. Water 
boils at a temperature of 212 degrees Fahrenheit. Eggs 
should be cooked at a temperature between 165 and 185 
degrees Fahrenheit. 

Place water in a saucepan and bring to a boil ; boil for 
three minutes and add the eggs. Place on the back of the 
stove and let the eggs stand for eight minutes for a very 
soft boil and twenty-five minutes for hard boiled. The 
water should be kept hot — ^that is, just below the boiling 
point. 

FRIED EGGS 

Place the fat in the pan and heat until very hot and 
then place where the pan will maintain this heat without 
getting any hotter; if you use the gas turn down the 
burner. Add the eggs. Let them cook very slowly until 
set and then turn if desired. Eggs cooked in this way 
will not absorb the fat and will be tender and delicate, and 
not have a crust of crisped egg around the edge. 

EGGS CARTHEOTH 

Tomatoes, peppers and pimentos are generally used 
for this dish. Prepare the tomatoes or peppers by cut- 
ting a slice from the top and then hollowing out the cen- 
tres. Break in an egg and then season with salt and 
pepper and a little finely minced parsley. Cover with two 
tablespoons of cream sauce. Place in the oven and bake 
for ten minutes. Finely minced ham or bacon may be 
sprinkled over the egg before adding the cream sauce. 

Cold cooked or left-over vegetables, such as corn, peas, 
asparagus, onions or cauliflower, may be used also. Cold 
boiled potatoes, beets, turnips, etc., may be made to do 
duty in place of tomatoes, peppers or pimentos for the 



MODERN COOKING 24-1 

sake of variety. Serve with a thick, highly seasoned 
sauce. 

POACHED EGGS 

To prepare poached eggs place water in a saucepan and 
add one tablespoon of vinegar to each pint of water. 
Bring to a boil and then open the egg on a saucer and 
slide into the boiling water, let simmer slowly until it 
forms and then lift with a skimmer on to a napkin to 
drain. Then roll gently on a slice of buttered toast. 

If you have any old-fashioned muffin rings place them 
flat in the bottom of the saucepan and then pour the eggs 
in and poach. Or you may use any of the poachers that 
are sold in any of the house-furnishing stores. 

OMELET 

Plain and fluffy omelets are cooked in the same man- 
ner as the fried eggs. 

PLAIN OMELET 

Place three tablespoons of shortening in a frying pan 
and then, while heating, place the three eggs in a bowl 
and add 

One tablespoon of milk One tablespoon of water 

Beat with a fork to thoroughyl mix and then, when the 
pan is smoking hot, turn in the mixture. Then place 
where the omelet will cook very slowly. Season and then 
turn and fold and roll, turning on a hot platter. 

SPANISH OMELET 

Use the fluffy omelet recipe and then chop fine two 
medium-sized tomatoes, drain free from the moisture and 
add one medium-sized onion and four large olives, 
chopped fine. Place in a small pan with one tablespoon of 
butter to heat. When hot spread over the omelet and 
then fold and roll or place in a hot oven and bake. 



242 MODERN COOKING 

FLUFFY OMELET 

Separate the yolks and whites of three eggs. Place 
the yolks in a bowl and add three tablespoons of milk. 
Beat to thoroughly mix and then beat the whites until 
very stiff. Cut and fold the yolks into the prepared 
whites and then turn into a pan and cook slowly. Fold 
and roll and turn on a hot platter. 

Fried eggs and omelets may be garnished with ham, 
bacon, parsley, finely chopped; pimentos and green 
peppers. 

To make variously flavored omelets, prepare the omelet 
as for plain omelet and then just before the turning and 
rolling add the desired flavoring. Then roll and fold the 
omelet and turn out on a hot dish. Have the filling 
heated before spreading on the omelet. Left-over vege- 
tables and bits of meat may be used in this manner for 
attractive dishes. 

TIGER-EYE SANDWICHES 

Use strictly fresh eggs for this. Separate the white 
the yolk and keep the yolk in the shell until ready for use. 
Add a pinch of salt to the white and beat until very stiff. 
Pile in a pyramid on a square slice of toast. Make a well 
in the centre of the white of egg and then drop in the 
yolk. Dust over lightly with paprika and then bake 
for seven minutes in a hot oven. 

MEASUREMENTS 

Many women are familiar with the importance of ac- 
curate measurements in preparing foods. Others fre- 
quently complain of the troubles they have with recipes, 
but what they actually need to know is that we no longer 
live in the days of twenty-five cents a dozen for fresh 
eggs and that the day of thirty cents per pound for cream- 
ery butter of excellent quaUty is past. 

Gone are the days of plenty when the extravagant cook 



MODERN COOKING 243 

was the best cook. Banish all recipes that call for cups 
of butter. 

From motives of real practical economy, we now use 
level measurements; that means that you first sift your 
flour into a bowl and then fill the measure, using a spoon 
to fill with and then level the top of the measure with a 
knife. Level measurement means all that lies below the 
edge of the cup or spoon. 

The experienced cook with an eye for measurements 
can gauge the amounts, very frequently, to a nicety. 
While she may sometimes have a failure, she will never 
attribute it to her measure or the method of compounding 
the ingredients ; oftentimes she will blame the flour, the 
baking powder or even the oven. 

One woman wrote me that she wished to know what 
the trouble was with her cakes. I asked her to give the 
recipe and she answered that she generally used a bowl 
for measuring and that then she used sugar, eggs, butter, 
flour and enough milk or water to make a batter — ^there 
was no real definite amounts. When I replied I told her 
that it was the measurements and methods that she used 
that frequently caused a failure. But she was sure that 
was not the case, for her cake was usually good, and it 
was only once in a while that she had a failure. So I had 
quite a time convincing her that accurate measurements 
will always give the same results and assured success 
and that she could bake the same cake 365 days in the 
year and not once have a failure. 

To-day this woman would not return to the old way 
of doing her cooking, and recently I had a little note 
from her telling me to let the other middle-aged and 
young housewives, too, know how necessary it is to be 
accurate. 

You know it only takes a few minutes longer to meas- 
ure accurately, and then you are able to make that de- 



244 MODERN COOKING 

licious cake without a failure. No failures, no waste. 
Truly, the words of "trusting to luck" should be taboo 
in the efficient woman's kitchen. 

The temptation to add just a little more sugar, flour or 
shortening to a recipe with the idea of improving it must 
be eliminated if you wish to cook successfully. When 
using vegetable oil in place of butter in making cakes cut 
down the quantity of fat fully one-third. Many cake 
recipes contain too much fat. 

When the amounts are less than one cup, frequently it 
is easier to measure with a spoon. Remember all meas- 
ures are level : 

Sixteen tablespoons 1 cup 

Eight tablespoons Y^ cup 

Four tablespoons J4 cup 

Five tablespoons plus one teaspoon % cup 

Sift the flour once before measuring. Standard meas- 
uring cups holding one-half pint are divided on one side 
into quarters and on the other side into thirds, and they 
are usually found in all housefumishing stores, and there 
is a choice of aluminum, glass or tin. 

Sets of measuring spoons will save time and trouble. 
The spoons graduate from one-quarter of a teaspoon to 
one tablespoon, thus making accurate measurements for 
seasoning and flavoring. 

A spatula will repay its cost many times over the first 
month it is used. It is possible with this knife to remove 
every particle of food from a mixing bowl 

How can you keep a house without a pair of reliable 
scales? Do you know how much the chicken weighed 
that you bought on Saturday, and do you know how much 
waste there was; or the weight of the bone in the meat 
that you purchased on Wednesday? Do you ever weigh 
your purchases? Think this over and then buy a good

VEAL 

Veal is the dressed carcass of the calf. The flesh should 
should be firm, pinkish white and should be well cooked 
to develop its flavor and nutritious qualities. The cuts 
are the neck, shoulders, rack, breast, loin and leg. The 
shoulders, breast and loin are used for roasting, the neck 
and end of the leg for stewing, the leg for cutlets and the 
rack for chops. The knuckle from the leg of veal may be 
used for stews, soups, stock or pepper pot. 

Other products from the calf are heads, brains, hearts, 
sweetbreads, feet, calves' liver, tripe, kidney and tongue, 
the kidneys are usually left in the loin. 

TO COOK 

The shoulder may be boned and rolled or left plain or 
just remove the blade bone and then use a filling. The 
breast may have the bones removed and then a pocket 
made and filled. 



MODERN COOKING 261 

To roast the loin trim and tie into shape and then 
roast. 

Meat from the neck, breast and knuckle is frequently 
used with chicken and, if properly prepared, it is delicious.

turtle bleed for twenty minutes. Separate the body from 
the shell and remove the entrails. Carefully separate the 
liver and heart. Now, with a sharp knife, remove the 
meat from the shell and lay in boiling water for two 
minutes. Drain. Rub the legs and all flesh containing 
the outer skin until the skin is removed, with a coarse 
towel. Now, with a cleaver, chop the shell into five pieces 
and place in scalding water for five minutes. Remove 
from hot water. Use the knife to peel off the skin and 
bristle from the shell. Now lay the meat and shell in cold 
water for one and one-half hours. You now have white

nish with two hard-boiled eggs cut into quarters. 

SHRIMP 

Shrimp come, as a rule, cooked, but to cook shrimp: 
Plunge the shrimp into boiler prepared as for crabs. 
Boil for ten minutes, then drain and cool. Remove the 
shells and then they may be used for salads, croquettes 
and fried shrimps. 

TERRAPIN 

Diamond back or salt water terrapin are best. Fresh 
water terrapin may be used for coquettes and puree. 
Clean the terrapin by placing in fresh water for six 
hours. Wash in warm water and then place them alive 
in boiling water. Cook for five minutes. Remove and 
then rub with a coarse cloth the neck, legs and tail to re- 
move the skin. Wash again. Return to the pot. Cook 



256 MODERN COOKING 

until the legs leave the body easily. Usually about thirty- 
five minutes for small terrapin and seventy-five minutes 
for large ones. The age and condition determine the 
time of cooking. Cool. Now, before it is entirely cold, 
separate the terrapin from the shell, discard the small in- 
testines, shell, gall, etc. Cut the meat into pieces. 

Cook in cream sauce for a la Maryland ; in brown sauce 
for a la mode or stewed terrapin. 

STEWED SNAPPER 

Open a can of snapper into a china bowl and let stand 

for one hour ; place in a saucepan. 

Two cups of water Two tablespoons of butter 

Four tablespoons of corn- One and one-half tea- 
starch, dissolved in water spoons of salt 

Fagot of soup herbs One teaspoon of paprika 

Two cloves Juice of one lemon 

Grated rind of one-fourth lemon 
Bring to a boil and cook slowly for fifteen minutes; 

then add the snapper meat, heat slowly 10 minutes, serve. 

STEAKS 

The selection of steak depends entirely upon the num- 
ber of persons to be served. A steak cannot be classed as 
a cheap meat; the portions of bone and trimming make 
this meat a rare luxury in these times of high prices. 

Yet there come times when the men folk want steak 
— ^and steak it must be. There are three kinds of meats 
that are cut into steaks ; namely, the loin, rimip and round. 
All three will make delicious eating if properly prepared. 

The round steak has the least waste, and if steaks are 
taken from the first three cuts they should be tender 
and juicy, providing they are cut sufficiently thick and 
are properly cooked. 

The rump steak is fully as tender and palatable as loin 
and it contains about one-third less waste. The sirloin 



MODERN COOKING 257 

is the choicest cut in the whole carcass and it contains 
a proportionately large amount of waste. 

Have the butcher cut the round steak one-half inch 
thick and then pound it with a meat ax to break the 
tough tissues. Place on a platter and brush with salad 
oil and let stand for one-half hour. Now broil in the 
usual manner, turning everjr four minutes. Lift to a 
hot platter and spread with choice meat butters given 
below. 

Rump steak should be cut two inches thick and the 
bone and fat trimmed. Now nick and score the edge of 
the fat and brush with salad oil, and then broil the same 
as for round steak. 

The sirloin steak should be cut two inches thick. 
Have the butcher remove the chine bone and then the 
flank end. Let him add a piece of suet to the flank end; 
then put it through the food chopper for hamburg steak. 
It is a mistake to cook the flank with the sirloin. Brush 
the steak with salad oil and then broil. Lift to a hot 
platter. 

Place one pint of water and one tablespoonful of salt 
in the bottom of the broiling pan to prevent the fat 
drippings from taking fire. Turn the meat every four 
minutes, so that it makes the cooking even. To test 
the meat when broiling press with a knife; if it is soft 
and spongy it is raw. Watch carefully and when just 
beginning to become firm it is rare. Allow four minutes 
for medium and six minutes for well done. 

Po not turn the meat with a fork. The intense heat 
has sealed or seared the surface and caused the meat to 
retain its juices, and if you use a fork to turn it you will 
puncture or make an opening so that these juices will 
escape. 

A two-pound steak will be cooked rare in twelve 
minutes, medium in fifteen minutes and well done in 
eighteen minutes. Always lift to a hot platter.

SALADS 

Salads are a popular summer dish. They should be 
made from fresh vegetables which contain the health- 
giving elements that are so vitally essential for our 
physical well-being. There are also the mineral salts 
which help purify the blood stream and thus keep us 
physically fit. 

Eggs, etc., that are used in preparing the dressings 
have a food value that may be figured upon in our daily 
ration. Heavy salads, composed of meat, are best to 
be eliminated for the hot weather. Replace them with 
light, dainty, attractive salads, that are not only appetiz- 
ing but also easily digested. 

The making of a successful salad is an art indeed. 
The proper blending of the various ingredients and then 
using a well-blended dressing and garnishing, so that it 
will not only satisfy the eye but will tempt the palate as 
well; that is a real salad. 

The proper combinations are very important ; harmony 
must prevail. As, for instance, a combination of beets, 
tomatoes and carrots would not only be inartistic but also 
a poor combination of foods. Care must be taken in 
preparing the lettuce or other greens used. All plants 
that form into heads must be separately and thoroughly 
washed in order to free them from dirt and insects, and 
then they should be given a final washing in water that 
contains one tablespoon of salt to every two quarts, then 
rinsed in ice water. The bath in salt water will remove 
the tiny and almost invisible mites and slugs that cling 
to these greens. 

Many varieties of salad dressing may be prepared from 
mayonnaise or from the dressing purchased in bottles. 
When the housewife fails to make a good mayonnaise 
dressing, or the family is small, a good standard dressing 
already prepared may be purchased and used in the 
following recipes : 



MODERN COOKING 261 

RUSSIAN DRESSING 

One cup of salad dressing, One raw carrot 
or mayonnaise One raw onion 

One raw beet 

Pare and then grate the vegetables into the salad 
dressing and then add 

One teaspoon of salt One-half teaspoon of 

One teaspoon of paprika mustard 

One tablespoon of sugar 

Beat to mix and then use. This dressing will keep for 
a week, if it is placed in a bottle and stored in a cool 
place.

One-half cup of salad oil One-half teaspoon of 

Three tablespoons of mustard 

vinegar or lemon juice One-half teaspoon of

This will keep well until used.

Three-quarters cup of cornstarch 

water

three minutes. Pour into jars or jelly glasses and thin 
out with cream or evaporated milk when using. 

PIMENTO DRESSING 

Add four finely chopped pimentos to one-half cup of 
prepared salad dressing. 

PAPRIKA DRESSING 

Add one and one-half teaspoons of paprika to the 
French dressing. Shake well to blend. Paprika is a 
sweet, mild, red pepper that will not bite the tongue. 

During the warm weather use salads twice a day, be- 
ginning the day with water-cress, radishes or crisp young 
onions or leaves of lettuce for your health's sake. 

BLOND FRENCH DRESSING 

Place in a wide mouthed Four tablespoons of white 

bottle wine vinegar 

One teaspoon of sugar One-half cup of vegetable 

One teaspoon of mustard salad oil 
One-half teaspoon of salt 

Shake until creamy. 

The use of paprika is decidedly better than the pungent 
pepper. This pepper is a mildly sweet-flavored spice that 
does not irritate the delicate lining of the throat or 
stomach. Now, fully as important as the green appetizers 
are the dainty salads, lettuce, corn salad, endive, romaine, 
tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, cabbage and the cooked 
vegetables, such as lima beans, peas, string beans, beets, 
etc. 

The success of salads depends entirely on the dressings 



MODERN COOiaNG 263 

used with them. So, with this in mind, we will now 
prepare some delicious dressings. Place in a fruit jar 
and then put them in the ice box, where they can be had 
at a minute's notice. 

You know that often when you come home just fagged 
out, when perhaps you did not take the time to get 
luncheon, a cool, crisp salad and some thinly sliced 
buttered bread and a cup of tea will not only satisfy and 
refresh you, but will also prevent a headache.

MEATS 

In order to purchase meats intelligently so that we will 
receive the best value for money expended, it is necessary 
to know the nature of the cuts, and especially the propor- 
tionate amounts of lean meat, fat and bone that they 
contain; also the approximate food values of the meat 
obtained from various parts of the carcass. 

HIND QUARTERS 

Loin steaks average 57 per cent, lean, 33 per .cent 
visible fat, 10 per cent. bone. Sirloin steaks in general 
contain a larger percentage of lean meat and a smaller 
amount of fat than the porterhouse or club steaks. 

Rib cuts contain 52 per cent, lean meat, 31 per cent, 
fat, 17 per cent. bone. The greatest percentage of lean 
meat is found in the sixth rib, and the smallest in the 
eleventh and twelfth rib cuts. 

Round steaks are meat cut from the round. They 
average 67 per cent, lean meat, 20 per cent, fat and 16 
per cent. bone. The round steaks contain 73 per cent, to 
84 per cent, lean meat. 

The rump contains 49 per cent, lean meat, the round 
as a pot roast contains about 86 per cent, lean meat ; the 
largest percentage of fat is found in the rump roast. 
Soup bones contain from 8 per cent, to 60 per cent, lean 
meat. 

THE FOREQUARTERS 

The forequarters of beef contain the chuck, the 
shoulder, clod, neck and shank. The chuck contains 67 
per cent, lean meat, 20 per cent, fat and 12 per cent. bone. 
Chuck steak varies from 60 per cent, to 80 per cent, lean 
and from 8 per cent, to 24 per cent, fat. 

The clod or bolar cut contains 82 per cent, lean meat 
and 5 per cent. bone. 



270 MODERN COOKING 

Relatively more lean and less fat meat is found in the 
chuck rib roast than in the cut from the prime rib roast. 

The naval, brisket and rib ends average 52 per cent, 
lean meat, 40 per cent, fat and 8 per cent. bone. The 
brisket and navel cuts are similar in proportion, while 
the rib ends slightly higher in percentage of bone and less 
lean. 

Flank steak contains 85 per cent, lean meat and 15 per 
cent. fat. Shank cuts or soup bones from the shank vary 
from 15 per cent, to 67 per cent, lean meat and from 
25 per cent, to 76 per cent, bone, while the boneless shank, 
used for stews, goulashes, hashes and minces, contain 85 
per cent, lean meat and IS per cent. fat. 

The trimmings from the loin, in steaks reduce their 
weights about 13 per cent, and these trimmings average 
4.6 per cent, fat and 2 per cent. bone. Round steak is 
reduced about 7 per cent, in weight in trimmings, prin- 
cipally in fat ; chuck steaks about 6}i per cent., principally 
bone. 

Rump, shoulder, pot roast and neck are all materially 
reduced in weight by fat and bone trimmings, the size 
and condition of the animal determining the actual 
amounts. The actual proportion of lean meat, fat and 
bone in the various cuts, their relative values of economy, 
fixes the prices to the consumer. 

Taking the cuts of meat in their right order we have : 

First the neck for soup, stews and coming. The cost is 
very low and the waste is considerable. 

Second, the chuck. This includes the entire shoulder 
and contains five ribs. The first two ribs are usually sold 
as shoulder, roast and steak, and while they are about the 
same quality as No. 9, they cost considerably less. 

Third, the shoulder clod. This is part of the chuck and 
can be purchased in almost all markets. The price is 
low and there is no waste. It is used principally for 



MODERN COOKING 271 

steaks and pot roasts. When used for steaks, score the 
meat well. 

Fourth, shank. According to the market price, this is 
the cheapest part of the beef. However, it contains 54 
per cent, to 57 per cent, waste and requires long cooking. 
It is used for soups and stews. 

Fifth, ribs. Contains eight ribs; five of these are the 
prime cuts and used for roasting exclusively. 

Sixth, sirloin. The loin, some cuts contain as low as 
3 per cent, waste. The sirloin is tender; therefore, 
quickly and easily cooked. For this reason it is one of 
the most popular cuts. 

Seventh, porterhouse. This portion of the loin contains 
the choicest steaks, excellent and nutritious and easily 
cooked. The fillet or tenderloin forms a part of the 
loin and averages about 13 per cent, waste. 

Eighth, rump. This cut is very nutritious, but requires 
careful cooking to render it tender; it contains slightly 
more waste than the round. Good steaks are obtained 
from the rump ; it is also used for pot roast braising and 
coming. 

Ninth, pin bone, the middle portion of the loin. It is 
of excellent quality, tender and of good flavor and quite 
as popular as the loin. It is the face cut of the rump. 

Tenth, round. An inexpensive cut, containing only 7 
per cent, waste. It is nutritious as tenderloin, but not as 
tender. The first essential in cooking is to sear the out- 
side in order to retain the juices and then cook slowly 
until tender. 

Steak and roast are cut from the round and the back or 
heel and is used for pot roast and stews. 

One factor in helping to keep up the high prices of food 
is that the average woman, when she goes to market, has 
in mind fancy price and choice cuts for roast, steaks and 
chops. The choice cuts represent about 26 per cent, of 
the whole carcass, leaving about 74 per cent, to be dis- 



272 MODERN COOKING 

posed of. Now, if this becomes difficult, the fancy cuts 
must bear the additional cost and so become proportion- 
ately high in price. 

Take a cross cut of beef, weighing about six pounds 
and wipe with a damp cloth, and one-half cupful of flour 
patted into it and then brown quickly on both sides in a 
frying pan and then place in a fireless cooker or a mod- 
erate oven together with 

Two medium-sized onions One and one-half cups of 
One carrot, cut in quarters boiling water 

and cook slowly, allowing one-half hour for the meat to 
start cooking and then twenty-five minutes to the pound. 
Baste frequently. If baked in the range it should give a 
delicious, well-flavored roast, that will supply the most 
finicky family with a good substantial food. 

The bolar cut from the shoulder may be prepared the 
same way. 

Meat from the the neck and shin may be used for 
stews, goulashes and meat loaves. 

POT ROAST OF SHIN BEEF, ENGLISH STYLE 

Have the butcher cut a piece of beef from the upper 
part of the shin, with the bone in. Wipe with a damp 
cloth and then pat in one-half cupful of flour. Brown 
quickly on both sides and then lift to a deep saucepan and 
add 

One large turnip, cut in One fagot of soup herbs 
quarters One-half teaspoon of sweet 

One large carrot, cut in marjoram 

quarters Two cups of boiling water 

Cover closely and cook slowly until the meat is tender, 
allowing one-half hour for meat to start cooking and 
twenty-five minutes to the pound, counting the time when 
it is put into the kettle. 

The plate and brisket may be used for soups, stews 



MODERN COOKING 273 

and goulashes and for corning. The brisket makes a 
splendid pot roast when boned and rolled. Also the plate 
or brisket may be used for a la mode. 

The flank steak is a choice piece of lean, boneless meat 
that lies close to the ribs and weighs from one and three- 
quarters to two and one-half pounds. It may be used for 
steaks, if cut in slanting slices or for mock fillet or rolled 
or for hamburg steak. 

When boiling or stewing meat, keep this in mind: 
Meat to be palatable and juicy must contain nutriment; 
it must be plunged into boiling water to seal the surface, 
by coagulating the albumen in the meat ; and then it should 
be cooked just below the boiling point until tender, al- 
lowing one-half hour for the meat to heat and start cook- 
ing and then twenty-five minutes to the pound. Add salt 
just before removing from the fire. 

Keep this fact in mind, that salt will, if added when the 
meat is just starting to cook, extract the juice. 

For pot roast and braises, etc., it is necessary to quickly 
sear over the surface of the meat for the same reason that 
the meat was plunged into boiling water and then cook 
slowly, allowing the same proportion of time as for boil- 
ing or stewing. 

The real object in cooking meat is to retain the juices 
and make it sufficiently tender to eat and increase its 
flavor. 

BEEF STEW 

Cut two and one-half pounds of stewing beef in two- 
inch pieces and then roll in flour and brown in hot fat; 
then add three pints of boiling water. Bring to a boil 
and cook slowly for one hour ; then place in a saucepan

securely with a stout string and then pat three-quarters 
cup of flour into the meat. Melt four tablespoons of 



MODERN COOKING 281 

shortening in a deep saucepan and when smoking hot add 
the prepared meat. Brown the meat, turning frequently, 
and then, when nicely brown, add one cupful of boiling 
water and simmer slowly, allowing the meat one-half hour 
to start cooking and thirty minutes to the pound. Add 
four large onions and when ready to lift one cup of boil- 
ing water for gravy. Usually this gravy requires no 
thickening. 

PLANKED STEAK 

Have the butcher cut the steak in two and one-half inch 
thicknesses from the large end of the sirloin. Remove the 
flank end and then the tenderloin, also taking out the 
bones. The butcher will do this for you. Now, when 
ready to prepare the steak, soak the plank in cold water 
for one hour. Heat the broiler and then place the plank 
in the oven. Cook the steak until quite rare in the broiler 
and then lift to a hot plank. Prepare a border of mashed 
potatoes and put them in a pastry bag, forced out around 
the edge of the plank. Garnish and smother with onions 
and minced green peppers. Place in a hot oven for ten 
minutes. Use the tenderloin for minute steaks. Ham- 
burg the flank and serve hamburg steaks. 

LIVER AND BACON, CREOLE 

Have the butcher cut the liver in thin slices. Wipe 
with a clean damp cloth and then roll in flour and brown 
in hot fat. Now add 

One cup of stewed tomatoes Two green peppers, 
One and one-half cups of chopped fine 

thinly sliced onions 

Cover closely and cook for five minutes, then add 

Two tablespoons of corn- One teaspoon of paprika 

starch One-quarter teaspoon of 

One and one-half teaspoons mustard, 

of salt One-half cup of cold water 



282 MODERN COOKING 

Dissolve the starch and spices well and then bring the 
mixture to a boil and cook slowly for fifteen minutes. 
Now place mashed potatoes on a large platter, shaping 
them flat on top. Lay the slices of liver on and then pour 
over them the sauce and garnish with nicely brown strips 
of bacon. Sprinkle with finely chopped parsley and serve. 

CHOP SUEY 

Slice sufficient meat from the cold roast of pork. Now 
cut in half-inch blocks and place in a pan and add 

One cup of celery, cut in One and one-half cups of 

dice thick brown sauce 

One green pepper, minced Two teaspoons of salt 

fine One teaspoon of pepper 

Four onions, minced fine One teaspoon of Worces- 

One cup of finely shredded tershire sauce 
cabbage 

Heat slowly to the boiling point and cook until the 
celery and cabbage are tender and then make a border 
around a large hot platter of cooked noodles and lift on 
the chop suey. Garnish with finely chopped parsley and 
serve. 

Note. — ^Make the brown sauce from the left-over 
gravy and bones making a stock. 

DELMONICO ROAST BEEF 

Have the butcher cut the seventh and eighth rib from 
a roast, removing the chine bone. Now have him remove 
the blade and meat between it and the skin, cutting off the 
top of the ribs. This gives you a heart-shaped piece of 
very tender beef. It is really the eye of these two ribs. 
Place the roast in a pan and dust lightly with flour, and 
then place in a hot oven for thirty minutes to start cook- 
ing. Now reduce the heat and cook, allowing twenty min- 
utes to the pound, counting the time from the minute you 
reduce the heat. 

Use the top of the ribs and the piece of meat from the 



MODERN COOKING 283 

blade for the pot roast or a beef a la mode. Have the 
butcher remove the blade and roll the flap-like piece 
around the ribs, fastening it with a skewer or the entire 
piece may be boned and rolled. 

BAKED SLICE OF HAM 

Have the butcher cut the ham in one-inch thick slices. 
Trim and then cut around the edges every two inches 
apart to prevent curling. Place on a baking dish and pour 
over the ham 

One cup of water 

Two tablespoons of syrup 

Bake in slow oven 25 minutes. 

ROAST SHOULDER OF LAMB 

Have the butcher bone and roll the shoulder and then 
when ready to use wipe with a damp cloth and pack with 
the following mixture : Chop very fine 

Four branches of parsley Three onions 

One leek 

Pat with flour and then roast in the oven, allowing 
thirty minutes to start cooking and twenty minutes to the 
pound, gross weight. Baste the meat after it commences 
to brown with one and one-half cups of boiling water. 

The season for spring lamb is from January to July. 
The meat is delicate and while less nutritious than mut- 
ton is delicious. 

Yearling is a splendid choice for Iamb. It is fully as 
nutritious as mutton, without the excess fat of mutton. 
Fat mutton frequently disagrees with persons of delicate 
digestion and therefore should be discarded from the 
menu, and the yearling should be substituted. 

The choice mutton is raised in Virginia, Pennsylvania 
and North Carolina, while that which comes from Wis- 
consin is of splendid quality. Canada also sends us some 
fine meat. 



284 MODERN COOKING 

Prime mutton is large and heavy, the fat firm and 
white and the flesh a deep red in color and very finely 
grained. This meat contains fully as much nutriment as 
beef. 

Soups and broths made from mutton when the fat is 
removed are very wholesome and are frequently ordered 
in diets by physicians. Mutton should be hung for a 
short period to ripen, but lamb should be used a short 
time after it is dressed. 

The cuts in the side of lamb or mutton usually num- 
ber six: (i) The neck, (2) the chuck, which includes 
some of the ribs as far as the shoulder blade, (3) the 
shoulder, (4) the flank or breast, (5) the loin and (6) 
the leg. 

In some parts of the country the butcher makes a cut, 
using the rack end of the loin and chuck for making the 
rib or French chops. The term chops is intended to 
designate meat cut from the rack or loin into chops, pref- 
erably one and one-quarter inches thick. Where the 
meat is cut with nine ribs on the loin, the shoulders and 
balance of the chuck is cut into chops for panning or 
braising. These chops require longer time for cooldng 
than those cut from tiie rack or loin. 

ACCOMPANIMENT FOR LAMB AND MUTTON 

Serve with a roast shoulder or leg of lamb, mint 
sauce, green grape jelly, peas or asparagus and baked 
potatoes. With mutton or lamb chops serve green grape 
jelly, mint or currant jelly. 

Mutton may be boiled and served with caper or soubis 
(onions) sauces, currant jelly sauce, boiled or mashed 
potatoes, peas, string beans, asparagus, stuffed tomatoes 
and cole slaw. 

HOW TO DISTINGUISH BETWEEN LAMB AND 
MUTTON 

Look first at the joint above the hool. In lamb this 



MODERN COOKING 285 

joint is serrated or tooth-shaped when broken, while in 
the yeariing and mutton it is the smooth oval ball-and- 
socket joint. In lamb the bones are pinkish in color; in 
mutton the bones are a blue-white color. The pinkish 
colored skin should be removed from lamb and yearling 
before cooking. This skin contains the woolly flavor. 

BONE AND STUFFED SHOULDER OF LAMB 

Have the butcher bone the shoulder of lamb and then 
wipe with a damp cloth. Now prepare a filling as fol- 
lows: Mince fine sufficient parsley to measure one-half 
cup. Place in a bowl and add 

One green pepper, minced Two teaspoons of salt 

fine One teaspoon of pepper 

Two onions, minced fine One-half teaspoon of sweet 

One cup of fine bread marjoram 
crumbs 

Mix and then spread the filling and roll, tying securely. 
Now pat just sufficient flour into the meat to cover. 
Place on a rack in the baking pan and put in a hot oven. 
Just as soon as the meat becomes brown commence the 
basting with one cup of boiling water. Reduce the heat 
to a moderate oven. 

The time to cook : Allow the meat thirty minutes for 
heating, so as to start cooking, and then twenty minutes 
to the pound, coimting gross weight. 

Keep the fact in mind that the rolled and filled meat 
requires more time than just the plain shoulder. 

To roast the shoulder unboned allow one-half hour to 
start cooking and then fifteen minutes to the pound. 

The leg of lamb may be boned and rolled or rolled 
and filled, and then cooked just Hke the shoulder. 

BENGAL CURRY OF LAMB 

Use the broken and coarse pieces of meat from the 
roast lamb. Chop fine and then place in a saucepan and 



286 MODERN COOKING 

add just sufficient water to barely cover. Now add 

One onion, minced fine fine 

One green pepper, minced Four branches of parsley 

Cook slowly until the meat is very tender. Now thicken 
the gravy, using cornstarch, and season with 

One teaspoon of Worces- One teaspoon of paprika 

tershire sauce One-half teaspoon of curry 

Four tablespoons of catsup powder 
Two teaspoons of salt 

Make a border of cooked rice on a hot platter. Lift 
the curry into the centre of platter and garnish with one 
hard-boiled egg, chopped fine. 

BAKED EMINCE OF LAMB IN GREEN PEPPERS 

Mince the left-over portion of roast lamb fine, then 
measure and add any filling that may be left over. Place 
in a saucepan and add just sufficient boiling water to 
cover. Cook slowly until tender and then thicken the 
gravy. Now to one cup of the cold meat add 

One cup of boiled rice Three onions, chopped fine 

One cup of canned One tablespoon of salt 

tomatoes One teaspoon of paprika 

Mix and then fill into the prepared peppers. Set in a 
baking pan and add one cup of boiling water. Bake in 
a moderate oven for thirty-five minutes. Serve with 
cheese sauce. Boiled mutton or lamb may be used in 
these dishes to replace the roast meat. 

HOW TO USE LEFT OVER LAMB 

Cut slices from the roast lamb and then line a large 
platter with crisp leaves of lettuce. Place on the platter 
the slices of meat. Serve with mint or currant jelly. Use 
the uneven pieces for curry of lamb or a baked emince 
of lamb, with green peppers and vegetable salad.

HALLOWE'EN 

On Hallowe'en the good fairies are permitted to make 
themselves visible to their many friends — so the tra- 
ditions of Ireland tell us. And the little ones, as they 
are called by the romantic fun-loving Irish nation, play 
a great many tricks this night on their enemies and they 
reward their ti-ue friends with many blessings. 

It is truly a wonderful night for the romantic maiden 
to delve into the future and find, or try to find, her luck 
when seeking for the knowledge of her future life part- 
ner. In those good old days of long ago, the lad and 
lassie spent a pleasant evening trying all the lucky spells 
to insure them success in their love affairs for the com- 
ing year. 

And in the midst of much hilarity many games are 
played; there are bobbing and ducking for apples, spin- 
ning the plate, post-office, heavy, heavy, what hangs over 
and forfeits. These were some of the old-fashioned 
ways the boys and girls of yesteryear passed a happy 
evening. 

Other old legends told that this one night in the year 
the spooks or ghosts were permitted to roam the earth, so 
that, to escape their notice, all must go masked — hence 
our young folk disguised themselves and wandered forth 
from house to house, seeking entertainment; for many 
informal parties were held on this eve and no one was 
refused admission ; each visitor was treated to apples and 
nuts and then he wandered on his way. 

Let your young folk entertain their friends with a 
good old-fashioned Hallowe'en party; let them play the 
old games of long ago, and then close to the magic hour 
of midnight serve a real old-fashioned Hallowe'en 
supper.

A nice change for the family is to give them corn muf- 
fins and plain rolls or biscuits in place of bread. Usually 
in the hurry and bustle of getting the business folk off in 
time in the morning and then preparing the children for 
school the housewife does not have the time to prepare 
these homey, old-fashioned breads for breakfast. 

The price of butter makes it almost prohibitive to use 
it as a spread for hot cakes, yet we all like the butter 
flavor. So let us follow the example of the thrifty New 
England woman, who puts the syrup into a good-sized 
pitcher and then adds two tablespoons of butter to one 
and one-half cups of syrup. Place the pitcher into a 
pan of warm water and then heat. Stir frequently, so 
that the butter will melt and blend thoroughly with the 
syrup. Just before sending to the table beat thoroughly. 
This not only makes a delicious spread for hot cakes and 
waffles and the like, but it is a real economy and a sav- 
ing in butter.

YE OLD-TYME OYSTER PYE 

To prepare the crust, place in a mixing bowl 
Two cups of sifted flour Two teaspoons of baking 

One teaspoon of salt powder 

Sift to mix and then put one-quarter pound of suet 
through the food-chopper. Then rub the finely chopped 
suet through a fine sieve to remove the stringy parts. 
Now rub the suet into the flour and mix to a dough 
with one-half cup of cold water. Then chop and fold 
for two minutes. Turn on a floured pastry board and 
divide into two pieces. Roll out one-half of the dough 
until one-quarter inch thick and then turn a large plate 
over this dough and cut around the edge of the plate. 
Be sure that the plate is at least two inches larger than 
the top of the baking or casserole dish. 

Now drain the oysters and look over carefully for the 
bits of shell. Place the oysters in a casserole or baking 
dish and add the stalk of celery that has been scraped 
clean and then diced and cooked until tender, also 
One grated onion of salt 

Three tablespoons of One teaspoon of white

or prick with a fork, and place on a baking sheet and 
bake a delicate light brown. Wrap in a napkin to keep 
warm. When ready to serve the oyster pie, place two

TURKEY 

A Creole method of roasting turkey, chicken, duck or 
game or broiling fowl, birds or game is given below. 
Clean and prepare the bird to suit the taste, and when 
ready to cook, whether broiling, roasting or baking, lard 
the breast with many strips of salt pork or bacon, or 
fastened on with toothpicks. Place in a hot oven to sear, 
then turn the bird, be it large or small, on; its breast. 
Roast, bake or broil for three-quarters of the time on its 
breast, basting every ten minutes. Dredge occasionally 
with flour. Do not season at the beginning of cooking. 



302 MODERN COOKING 

but delay this until the last quarter of the time allotted 
for cooking the bird, then turn it on its breast to brown. 

Finish cooking, basting every ten minutes. This 
method permits the heat to cook the heaviest part of the 
bird slowly, so that, by turning on its breast, the bony 
structure may receive the intense heat. 

Birds or fowls that are old should be steamed before 
roasting. This method will make them tender and juicy.

are only two kinds of pie, namely, " 'Tis mince and 't'aint 



MODERN COOKING 813 

mince." So, as Grandma Perkins says, "This is aU 
mince." 

HOW TO PREPARE THE MINCE

apples peanuts 

One-half pound of candied Three-quarters pound of 

citron suet 

One-half package of seeded One pound of dried 

raisins peaches

One quart of syrup One pound of brown sugar 

in a preserving kettle and bring to a boil. Cook for ten

Stir to mix thoroughly, then cook for ten minutes. 
Cool and then fill into fruit jars. Pour one tablespoon of 
salad oil on top; adjust the rubber and lid and seal. 
Process in hot water bath for twenty minutes and then 
cool and store. 

This mince will be found to be most delicious, and it 
will keep until used. Grandma Perkins's grandad was 
a Hiram Teesdale, of Gloucester, England, and this recipe 
is over ^00 years old. The original recipe was named 
Christmas'Mynce Pye, and on the holidays, a great pye 
of Gloucester mynce, made by good dame Teesdale, was 



ai4 MODERN COOKING 

always sent as a tithe from the county to the good Queene 
Elizabeth, and in this way royal favor was conferred on 
this family by the queen, who was delighted with the won- 
derful concoction. 

Black walnuts and hazel nuts were used in the original 
recipe, but as these nuts are quite expensive, the peanuts 
will do just as well. 

CHRISTMAS GOODIES 

In the days of long ago, before the day of heated apart- 
ments and water-heated homes, the housewife used the 
cellar as the cold-storage room. To-day this is impos- 
sible. For the householder who has an outside enclosed 
laundry or summer kitchen, the problem of keeping the 
holiday delicacies is quite an easy one. But to those of us 
who dwell in flats and apartments, some other way must 
be arranged. 

Here are two new ideas that are worth trjdng : First, 
a window box on the shady side of the house. This box 
must be lined with asbestos paper on the inside, and then 
covered with the same paper and an additional covering 
of oil cloth upon the outside. 

By covering the box in this way, the housewife is as- 
sured of a smaller storage space of an even temperature. 
Neither the extreme cold nor heat will affect this box. 
A thick layer of newspapers may be used as a lining, be- 
tween the inside covering of the asbestos and the oil cloth 
covering upon the outside of the box. 

Mincemeat must be stored in a cool, dry place to blend 
and ripen, without the danger of freezing. This is also 
an ideal time for the mother to plan to have the family 
help her and at the same time knit the home ties very 
closely together. The home where the family joins in the 
evening to make the seasonable delicacies is a very happy 
one. Let the children have some of their friends in to 
help them with the preparations. 



MODERN COOKING 315 

CHICKEN CUSTARD 

Place one pint of chicken stock in a mixing bowl and 
add 

One small onion, grated One-half teaspoon of 

One and one-half tea- paprika 

spoons of salt Four eggs 

Beat until thoroughly mixed and then fill into well- 
buttered glass custard cups and set the cups in a baking 
pan and fill the pan half full of warm water. Place in a 
slow oven to bake until firm. Remove from the oven and 
let stand for five minutes to settle, then loosen the edges 
of the custard from the cups with a knife and turn on a 
slice of toast and serve with parsley sauce. This is a de- 
licious luncheon dish.

BEVERAGES 

To prepare chocolate as a beverage it is necessary to 
boil or cook it thoroughly. The mere fact of pouring 
boiling water or milk upon the cocoa will not cook it suf- 
ficiently, 

HOW TO PREPARE CHOCOLATE 

The Mexican epicure long ago discovered that to make 
chocolate successfully, it is necessary to beat it con- 



332 MODERN COOKING 

tinually and he thus perfected a chocolate whip whicH is 
a wooden beater with a number of wooden rings fastened 
to it; when this is used to stir the chocolate it churns the 
mixture to a froth. 

The French use a number of switches, bound into a 
yrldp. The American housewife uses a flat wire whip 
for this purpose. 

Cocoa. — Place in a saucepan three-fourths cup of 
water and two level teaspoons of cocoa for each cup of 
cocoa desired. Bring to a boil and then cook for five 
minutes. Beat continually, then add one-fourth cup of 
scalded milk for each cup of cocoa. Bring to a boil 
again and then serve. 

Chocolate. — ^Use three ounces of chocolate to one quart 
of water. Cut the chocolate fine and then add water and 
stir constantly. Bring to a boil and cook for ten minutes. 
Add one cup of scalded cream and then bring again to 
boiling point and serve. One tablespoon of whipped 
cream may be added to each cup just before serving. 

HOW TO BREW A CUP OP TEA 

From an old tea merchant in London I received my in- 
structions for making a perfect cup of tea. First rinse 
out the tea-pot with cold water and then fill it with boil- 
ing water, and let stand while you bring the water in- 
tended for the tea to a boil. Just before the water 
boils, turn out the water in the teapot and wipe dry. 
Then add the tea leaves and pour on the freshly boiled 
water. Cover the pot with a tea cosy or wrap in a towel 
and let stand exactly seven minutes. The tea is now 
ready to drink. This will give you a delicious drink of 
ambrosia that will delight the heart of true lovers of a 
good cup of tea. 

The use of a cosy for the teapot is to hold the heat in 
the pot and thus prevent quick cooling. Use one level 
teaspoon of tea to each one-half pint of water. Measure 
the water before boiling. The water must be poured on 



MODERN COOKING 333 

the tea immediately upon reaching the boiling point. 
After boiling for two minutes or longer the water quickly 
loses its natural gases. 

COFFEE 

Many varieties abound in the market. Among the 
best is the Arabian, with Liberian and Maragogipe 
closely following. After the coffee is harvested the 
quality and the value depend on the care in curing and 
packing. Brazil supplies the United States with about 
80 per cent, of all the coffee used. Mexico and Central 
America together furnish about 17 per cent., thus leav- 
ing about 3 per cent from foreign countries. 

Various brands of coffee known by the housewife are : 



Mocha 


Santa 


Java 


Maracaibo 


Rio 


Bogota 


Santa Bourbon 


Pedberry 



The first named are the most expensive, the last named 
the cheapest. The word "blend" when used wijji coffee 
means a mixing of two or more varieties, producing a 
coffee of various strengths and of a smooth, mellow 
flavor. 

After the coffee is roasted it should be kept in air- 
tight cans. Grinding is the next important step, and this 
must be just right to get the full strength. Coffee 
coarsely ground is not desirable, as it requires a long time 
to infuse and is therefore wasteful. A medium fine grind 
will be found practical for those who use the old-style 
coffeepot. To filter, using the percolator, the coffee 
should be quite fine. The water falls continually over 
the coffee and produces a uniform cup. 

How to make good coffee, using the old-fashioned 
coffeepot: Place one level tablespoon of medium finely 
ground coffee in the pot for every cup desired; add the 
water and bring quickly to the boiling point. Stir with 
a spoon and then add a small pinch of salt and four 



884 MODERN COOKING 

tablespoons of cold water to settle the grounds. Let it 
stand in a warm place for five minutes ; then serve. 

Percolator method: Place three-quarters of a level 
tablespoon of finely ground coffee in a percolator for 
each cup desired. Add the water and then place the pot 
on the fire. Let the coffee filter just four minutes after 
the first pumping of the water in the glass top shows a 
coffee color. This will ^oduce an even, uniform cup of 
stimulating beverage. 

CURRANT SLING 

Place one box of currants in a saucepan and add three 
cups of water. Bring to a boil, mashing with potato 
masher. Cook for fifteen minutes and then strain. Add 
two cups of sugar and bring to a boil. Cook for five 
minutes and then cool. Place one-half of the currant 
syrup in a tall glass and add

Bring to a boil and cook slowly until the fruit is soft. 
Rub through a fine sieve and add one-half cup of mara- 
schino cherries, cut into tiny bits, and the liquid from the 
bottle of cherries. 

To use : Place one-half cup of the prepared raspberry 
syrup in a tall thin glass and add 
One tablespoon of lemon One-half cup of crushed ice 

juice

fine sieve and add juice of one lemon. 

To use: Place one-half cup of the peach mixture in 

a glass and add 

Two tablespoons of cream One-half cup of crushed ice 

and fill with carbonated water. 

A box of straws to use in serving these iced drinks 
makes them doubly attractive. 

HOW TO PREPARE ICE CREAM 

Prepare the mixture for freezing early in the morning, 
while working in the kitchen, and then when it is cool 
place in the ice box to be thoroughly chilled until needed. 
Scald and cool the can and then place in the refrigerator. 
When ready to prepare the cream for freezing, place the 
ice in a bag and with a wooden mallet pound it fine. 
Now pour the prepared mixture into the cold can and 
place the dasher in position. Place the can in the freezer 
and adjust the turning crank, and give a few turns of 
the handle to see that everything is working easily. Now 
use a pint bowl for measuring and pour in three meas- 
ures of ice, then one of salt. Repeat this until the ice 



MODERN COOKING 387 

and salt are above the mixture inside the can. It is 
necessary to be accurate if you wish to obtain good re- 
sults. 

Haphazard measuring only means failure. Turn the 
freezer until it begins to become difficult to turn, then re- 
move the dasher, using a wooden spoon to scrape and 
pack. You must work quickly, as it is important not to 
keep the can open any longer than necessary. Place a 
cork in the opening in the lid of the can and cover the 
top of can with a piece of wax paper, then put on the 
lid. 

Now drain off all the water. Repack, using four parts 
of ice to one part salt. Cover closely and set aside for 
one and one-half hours to ripen. 

If all preparations are made earlier in the day, it will 
take about one-half hour to put together the mixture and 
make the cream. 

Frozen desserts are divided into two classes, ices and 
ice creams. The ices include sherbets, water ices, f rappes 
and sorbets. Ice creams include Philadelphia cream, 
American and French creams, parfaits and mousses. 
Sherbets contain gelatine or whites of eggs and water-ice 
mixture. Water ices are fruit juices sweetened and 
diluted with water. Frappes are partially frozen water 
ices. Sorbet is a mixture of flavors prepared as for water 
ices or a frozen punch. 

ICE CREAM 

Philadelphia ice cream is made from thin sweetened 
cream. American ice cream is a mixture of thin cream 
and a custard well flavored, which is then frozen. Fre- 
quently junket preparations are used in this cream. 
French ice cream is a plain, frozen, rich custard. 
Parfaits are creams made from a thick syrup, egg yolks 
and whipped cream, packed in a mould and frozen. 

Mousses are heavy creams flavored and sweetened and 
then whipped, packed into a mould and frozen. 



888 MODERN COOKING 

It is important to note that the can must not be over 
two-thirds full. All creams in the making increase in 
volume and therefore they must have sufficient room for 
churning. See that all parts of the freezer work freely 
before starting. If rusty or stiff use a drop or two of 
salad oil and then turn until it works freely.

FROZEN STRAWBERRY CUSTARD 

A small two-quart freezer will make sufficient for the 
ordinary family at a very small outlay. It will require 
about ten pounds of ice and one and one-quarter pounds 
of salt. Break the ice very fine and use a bowl to meas- 
ure with. Allow three parts of the ice to one part of 
salt for the freezing mixture and four parts of ice to one 
part salt for the packing mixture. 

Make a custard by placing three cups of milk in a 
saucepan and adding one-half cup of cornstarch. Dis- 
solve the starch in the cold milk and then bring to a boil.

DIET TO REDUCE WEIGHT 

Correct eating is essential to health and because of 
this the proper cooking and serving of food plays an im- 
portant part, in either the building up or reducing of 
weight to a desired average. 

As a rule, stout people seldom realize that they are 
eating food that is entirely unsuited to them ; and not only 



MODERN COOKING 348 

do they love starchy and over-rich foods, but also they 
frequently consume a liberal portion of sweets. 

Now unwise eating seldom produces its effects at once. 
When noticed, the body is already burdened with heavy 
layers of fat, that not only cause their bearer to be dis- 
tressed and uncomfortable, but also cause disease. 

Not all of us can eat every food that is put before us, 
but we can so arrange our menus that we will be able 
to balance the diet and in this way supply the body with 
just its required needs. 

Eating over-large portions of rich desserts, fatty foods 
and starchy products causes these foods to turn into a 
fatty tissue, and then be stored in the body as adipose 
tissue. So, in order to get good results, the person 
who wishes to reduce should learn to thoroughly chew 
all foods. By this I mean chew the food very fine, so 
that it will be thoroughly mixed with the saliva and 
then flow without much effort to the stomach. 

You know that all starchy foods are changed by the 
action of the saliva into invert sugars; they then go to 
the stomach where they are thoroughly diluted with 
gastric juices and finally passed into the intestines, where 
the final processes of digestion take place. 

This form of starch is stored by the liver and kidneys, 
and thus passes out to the various tissues to be held in the 
body as fat. 

To reduce this fleshy tissue it is necessary to prevent 
the storage of more sugars, starches and fats in the body, 
and to cause that which is already stored there to be 
gradually consumed to prevent starving. 

Many people who go on a diet for reducing flesh in a 
few days complain of great weariness, exhaustion and 
gnawing hunger in the pit of the stomach. A diet that 
cuts down the supply of food with the intention of re- 
ducing is extremely dangerous unless it is supervised^ by 
a physician. But persons who wish to make a visible 
reduction of flesh in a time ranging from five to six 



344 MODERN COOKING 

weeks can do so, if they will learn the foods that cause 
and feed these flesh- forming tissues and learn to replace 
this with non-fat-forming foods. 

And summer time is an ideal time to accomplish a re- 
duction of flesh for those who wish to try it.

WHAT THESE BREAKFASTS ELIMINATE 

The sugar and cream from fruit and coffee and the 
butter from the toast — ^all of which are fat-forming 
foods. Toasting bread dexterizes the starch and thus 
helps the digestion of this starchy product. 

Breakfast may be eaten from 7 to 8.30 a.m., and is so 
balanced that those who board or take their meals in 
restaurants may easily follow the diet. Now, during the 
warm weather, it is more important to eat lightly during 
the noon period, and for this reason a light luncheon will 
be provided. Those who are employed in sedentary oc- 
cupations should partake of a milk and egg shake, or 
chocolate egg and milk; and this will be sufficient until 
the evening meal, or for luncheon you may have

This meal eliminates potatoes, butter and the rich heavy 
desserts. The portions should be about three ounces of 
lean meat and one-half cup of each vegetable, three leaves 
of lettuce. Use French dressings on all salads and one- 
half cup of fruit for dessert. 

This amount of food will not only satisfy, but also will, 
if persisted in, give satisfactory results in the reduction 
of flesh. This means that you cannot eat candy and 
other sweets between meals, and if you feel that you must 
have something sweet, try a piece of chewing gum. If 
fruits are too sour, try com syrup for sweetening ; about 
one-half cup to each quart of prepared fruit. Fresh 
fruits develop their own natural sweetness if they are 
baked instead of stewed in a saucepan. Just place them 



MODERN COOKING 349 

in a casserole dish with this amount of syrup or plain 
water and bake in a moderate oven for thirty-five 
minutes. 

CINNAMON TOAST 

Place two ounces of butter in a bowl and cream well. 
Add 

Five tablespoons of sugar 

One teaspoon of cinnamon extract or powdered cinnamon 
Cream and then spread on nicely toasted bread. 
FRIED OYSTERS 

Unless the oyster is attractive in appearance, single 
dipped and fried an attractive brown, it is a failure as a 
fried oyster; few housewives seem to be able to turn 
out a perfect product. 

Use large oysters, and look them over carefully for 
bits of shell. Wash and then roll in highly seasoned corn 
flour. Let dry off for ten minutes and then dip in pre- 
pared egg, and then roll in fine bread crumbs. Stand 
aside to dry for ten minutes. Fry only three or four at a 
time in hot fat. Care must be taken to have the fat suffi- 
ciently hot. Usually about 370 degrees Fahrenheit will 
do. 

If you do not use a fat thermometer to test the fat, 
then try it with a piece of bread in the following rnanner : 
Place a crust of bread in the fat and begin to count 101, 
102, 103, 104, etc., until you reach 110; the bread should 
then be a deep golden brown. Then proceed to fry the 
oysters, keeping the fact in mind that more than three or 
four in at once will reduce the temperature of the fat 
and thus permit the oyster to soak up the grease. 

TO PREPARE THE CORN FLOUR 

One cup of corn flour Two teaspoons of salt 

One and one-half teaspoons of paprika 
Sift three times. To prepare the egg dip:

brown in hot fat. 

The oyster is one of our most democratic luxuries ; it is 
in very high favor in our most luxurious restaurants, and 
yet it is held in equal esteem in our most moderate-priced 
lunch rooms. Oysters are sold both in and out of the 
shell, fresh and canned, and they may be eaten and cooked 
in almost every conceivable way. 

Among the best-known varieties are blue point, Buz- 
zard Bays, Cape Cods, Lynnhavens, Maurice Rivers, 
Rockaways, saddle rocks, sea tags, Shrewsberrys and 
coruits and Oak Creeks. Many of these titles have really 
lost their real significance by trade misuses. Blue points, 
for example, is often, though incorrectly, applied to all 
.small oysters, irrespective of their source. 

The oyster season opens in September and continues 
on until May. Three sizes are usually recognized by the 
trade — ^half shells, the smallest culls, the medium size and 
the box, which is the largest. True oyster lovers really 
prefer the large Lynnhavens and others on the deep 
shell 

The epicure delights in eating raw oysters; and while 
this satisfies his appetite, it is also understood that the 
raw oyster virtually is assimilated without taxing the 
digestion. 

Oysters may be found \in almost all parts of the civilized 
world, each locality having its own special species. 

It is a universal custom to omit the oyster from the 
bill of fare during the months of May, June, July and 
August. We have in their places the salt oyster and the 
clam. 

Oysters may be served on either the deep or flat shell, 
on a bed of finely crushed ice with a slice of lemon, 



MODERN COOKING 868 

Worcestershire sauce, catsup, horseradish or tabasco 
sauce. Nice crisp celery and toasted crackers generally 
accompany raw oysters. Do not, under any circum- 
stances, cover the oyster with ice. Oysters may be made 
into cocktails or may be frozen. 

TO MAKE A COCKTAIL 

One-half cup of catsup onion 

One tablespoon of Worces- Two drops of tabasco 

tershire sauce sauce 

One tablespoon of grated Juice of one-half lemon 

Mix well and use for four oyster cocktails, allowing five 
small oysters per person. 

FRAPPE OYSTERS 

Place oysters in freezer and freeze until soft mush, and 
then serve in cocktail or sherbet glasses with garnish of

popular ways of preparing them.

SWEET POTATOES 

Sweet potatoes are the roots or tubes of a vine-like 
plant ; it is a native of tropical climate, but it is grown in 
states as far north as New York. The delicious yams of 
the southern states and the West Indies are made into 
many attractive foods. The food value of the sweet 
potato is closely allied to that of the white potato, but it

Remove the coarse, bruised outside leaves of the 
cabbage and then shred the head fine, using a slaw cutter. 
Now line the bottom of a small barrel or wooden bucket 
with the outside leaves and then place in a layer of the 
shredded cabbage and cover with salt. Repeat until the 
utensil is nearly full, pounding down well with wooden 
mallet when packing. Sprinkle the salt over the top 
and cover with large cabbage leaves and then with a 
cheese-cloth wrung out of salt water. Tuck in the ends 
carefully and then place board on the kraut and weight it 
down with a heavy stone. 

Now, it is necessary that the cabbage be covered with 
brine ; remove the scum as it rises to the top. The kraut 
will be ready for use in six weeks and it must be kept 
in a very cool place or it must be canned. 



MODERN COOKING 371

keg or crock. Pack the cauliflower head down until the 
keg or crock is three-quarters full and then fill to over- 
flowing with brine made as follows: 

Place in a boiler 

Eight quarts of water Eight cups of salt 

Bring to a boil and skim, then cool. Cover the cauli- 
flower with a piece of clean cheese-cloth and then place 
on it a board which is weighted down on top, to keep 
the cauliflower covered in the brine. This weight need 
not be as heavy as that used for the kraut. 

Cauliflower prepared in this manner late in October 
and November can be used for the table by freshening it 
in water and cooking in a manner similar to that in which 
the salted beans are cooked, or it may be canned in three 
months, when there will be a supply of fruit jars. 

To can the brined cauliflower, remove from the brine 
and wash in cold running water. Let stand for one 
hour and then fill into the sterilized jars; fill jars with

QUINCES 

The quince is the fruit of a tree of the apple and pear 
family, and a true native of southern Europe and Asia. 
It is cultivated in all temperate climates. 

The ancient Greeks and Romans accredited the quince 
with many healing powers. There is a legend of a beau- 
tiful Grecian maid who discovered the true secret of 
making marmalade, and this was afterward served by 
maids of Athens to their sweethearts after the conquests. 

The name marmalade is from the Portuguese, which is 
marmelo. 



376 MODERN COOKING 

The quince is a fruit that cannot be eaten in its raw 
state, but is most delicious in jam, jelly marmalade and 
quince butter, and vies with apple and guava as the best 
fruit for jelly making. 

The large, smooth fruit is the first choice, and it must 
be carefully handled as it bruises quickly; parts which are 
bruised very rapidly discolor to a dark brown. To keep 
the quinces any length of time, wipe them frequently with 
a dry cloth, and set on a wire tray so that there may be 
a free circulation of air around the place, and place in a 
cool, dry and well-ventilated room. 

The seeds of the quince are rich in a mucilage-like 
matter, and they form a jelly-like paste when soaked in 
water. 

FANCY QUINCE MARMALADE 

Prepare the quinces as for Roman quince marmalade 
and measure the fruit. To four quarts of cooked quinces 
and juice add 

One package of seedless Two cups of finely chopped 

raisins almonds or other nuts 

One medium-sized bottle Two and one-half quarts 

of maraschino cherries, of granulated sugar 
cut into tiny bits 

Place in the preserving kettle and bring to a boil. Cook 
slowly until a thick marmalade and then fill into sterilized 
jars. Adjust the rubber and lid and seal. Process in a 
hot water bath for fifteen minutes and then store in a 
cool, dry place. 

QUINCE JELLY 

Wash the quinces and then cut in half, and remove 
the seeds and cores and pare. Cut the pared quince in 
thin slices and then place in a bowl and cover with cold 
water. 

Place the parings and seeds of the quinces in a preserv- 



MODERN COOKING 377 

ing kettle, and cover with cold water. Bring to a boil 
and cook until the parings are very soft. Mash fre- 
quently and turn into a jelly bag, and let drip. 

Measure the quince juice or liquid and return it to 
the preserving kettle. Bring to a boil and cook for ten 
minutes. Then add three-quarters cup of sugar for each 
cup of juice. Stir to thoroughly dissolve the sugar and 
then bring to a boil and cook for ten minutes. Pour into 
sterilized glasses. Cool and cover with melted paraffin 
and store in the usual manner for jellies. 

Now place the quinces which were cut into thin slices 
and cover with cold water in the preserving kettle, cover- 
ing the sliced quinces with water two inches above the 
fruit in the kettle. Bring to a boil and then cook slowly 
until the sliced quinces are soft. Drain off the juice and 
then measure the cooked fruit. Return to the kettle and 
add 

One quart of sugar One cup of water 

to every three quarts of cooked sliced quinces. Place 
on stove and cook slowly until a very thick jam. Fill in 
sterilized jars and adjust the rubber and lid and seal. 
Process in hot water bath for fifteen minutes and then 
cool and store. 

Use the liquid strained from the cooked quinces for 
jelly, following the rule for quince jelly. 

ROMAN QUINCE MARMALADE 

Wash the quinces, and then pare and cut into thin 
slices. Place in a preserving kettle and cover with cold 
water. Place on the stove and cook until tender. Now 
place the parings, cores and seeds in a separate kettle and 
cover with cold water. Bring to a boil and cook slowly 
until the pulp is very soft. Strain and add this liquid to 
the quinces which are cooking. Cook the quinces until 
very soft. Then mash through a fine sieve. 



378 MODERN COOKING 

Now measure this crushed pulp and juice and return 
to the preserving kettle. Bring to a boil and cook for 
fifteen minutes, and add two-thirds quart of sugar for 
every quart of the prepared quince pulp. Stir the sugar 
tmtil it dissolves and then bring to a boil, and cook slowly 
until the mixture is a thick jam. Pour into sterilized 
glasses or bowls and cool. Cover with melted paraffin. 

This Roman quince marmalade was accredited with 
the power to heal coughs and colds.

MENUS FOR THE NEW YEAR'S PARTY 

Planning a real, old-fashioned watch party to see the 
old year out and the new one in will afford a real en- 
tertainment. Have the folks arrive about lo o'clock and 
then pass an hour and a half in dancing, singing and gen- 
erally having a real good old-fashioned time. Then about 
11.45 serve the supper, so that just before midnight all 
are ready with a toast to the new year. 

Arrange so that each guest is in his place standing, 
with a wassail cup in hand, and then at three minutes of 
12, darken the room. When 12 o'clock is struck, turn 
on the lights and drink a Happy New Year. 

New Year merrymaking is as old as the history of 
England. There the head of the house assembles the 
family around the wassail bowl to drink the healths of 
every one. The Saxon phrase "Wasshael" means "Your 
health" ; hence the wassail bowl. In many of the shires

and counties the lads and lassies secure a large bowl and 
ornament it with ribbons and artificial flowers, and, 
with this visit the gentry, all the while singing songs 
suitable to the occasion.

Many persons like the old-fashioned idea of entertain- 
ing on New Year's Day with a real old-time dinner. An 
ideal number is either eight or twelve persons. Put the 
full quota of leaves in the dining-room table and ^ad it 
nicely. Cover with your best table cloth. A miniature 
tree or a bush of mistletoe or holly for a center-piece is 
both seasonable and appropriate. 

To serve this meal with one maid, it must be arranged 
so as to relieve her of the waitress tasks. Mould the but- 
ter into balls and arrange the service, allowing at least 
twenty-two inches between the guests. Place the celery 
and relish in glass dishes at intervals along the side of 
the table and serve the salad with the dinner.

FOR EIGHT COUPLES 

In English communities it is the custom to sit up and 
watch the departing year out and to welcome in the new. 
The farmers in the north country visit the orchards, 
while the folk in the highlands visit and return calls. 



MODERN COOKING 407 

The custom of New Year's calling is very old indeed, 
and in the years of long ago the Beau Brummels and 
dandies of the times enjoyed the New Year's calling as 
a very rare sport. 

The mummers who are abroad this day follow the 
ancient custom of dear old Scotland, where these rites 
have prevailed for many centuries. 

Toast the old year out and new one in with a loving 
cup: 

Ring out the old with all its hate. 
Ring in the new with love and cheer, 
Ring on, oh bells of time; 
Ring with joy, ere ye he too late. 

NEW YEAR'S PUNCH 

To prepare a loving cup for welcoming the new year 
for fifteen persons : 

One and one-half gallons of cider 
One-half dozen bananas, sliced thin. 
One small bottle of cherries, cut into bits. 

Place a large lump in the ice bowl and stir to blend. 
Serve in tall punch glasses.
