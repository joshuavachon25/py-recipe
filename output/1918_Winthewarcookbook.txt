O back to the simple life, be contented 
with simple food, simple pleasures, 
simple clothes. Work hard, pray hard, 
play hard. Work, eat, recreate and 
sleep. Do it all courageously. 

We have a victory to win.

Preface 

The only principles of public conduct worthy a man or gentle- 
man are to sacrifice ease, estate, health, applause and even life 
to the sacred call of country. JAMES OTIS 1761 

We here highly resolve that the dead shall not have died in 
vain that this nation under God shall have a new birth free- 
dom and that government of the people, by the people and for 
the people shall not perish from the earth. 

ABRAHAM LINCOLN, 1863. 

We dedicate our lives and our fortunes, everything that we are, 
and everything that we have. WOODROW WILSON, 1917. 

The great light of liberty, justice and equality that burst upon 
the world in 1776 is today threatened to be put out with a hand 
of blood and iron. 

Women of America, awake! We have a definite part to play 
in this, the greatest tragedy in the world's history. We need 
not form ourselves into BATTALIONS of death, but into BAT- 
TALIONS of life. Save food and we save life! 

We are unwilling to believe that the women of America are 
slackers, in other words, traitors to our beloved country and its 
beautiful emblem, within whose folds are wrapped all that makes 
existence worth while. A woman, if there be such, who says, "I 
will not use corn in place of wheat," who says, "I will not save 
i. teaspoonful of sugar each day," who says, "I will eat beef, 
mutton and pork daily," is as truly a traitor to her country as 
was Benedict Arnold or Aaron Burr. 

The object of this War Cook Book is to place within one cover 
all that which has been printed in manifold forms of the best 
thought of those capable of telling us how to use intelligently 
the substitutes which our Government has asked us to use. 

Ours is the splendid burden of feeding the world. It can be 
done in but one way: The way of voluntary and larger resolu- 
tion and action of the whole people in every shop and every 
kitchen and at every table in the land. 



8 "Win the War" Cook Book 

The Woman's Committee Council of National Defense have pub- 
lished this book with no other idea or purpose than to help our 
fellow-women do the little part which old Uncle Sam has asked 
us to do. 

So let us substitute food value for food value. 

We send our book forth with a prayer that it may play its 
little part in bringing liberty, justice and peace not only to our 
own country, but to the world. 

ACKNOWLEDGMENTS 

We have been greatly assisted in the compilation of this book 
by the National and State Food Administration, to whom we ex- 
tend our cordial thanks. 

We are particularly indebted to the Domestic Science Instruc- 
tors of the State University and of the Preparatory Schools of 
the city -of St. Louis and St. Louis County, for their advice and 
generous help. 

For encouragement and material assistance, we are especially 
grateful to Mr. T. B. Boyd and Mr. J. Hal Lynch.

ENDORSEMENTS 

The United States Food Administration, in returning our manu- 
script, writes: 

We thank you for submitting the matter to us and regret the 
delay in its return to you. May we take this opportunity also 
of expressing our deep appreciation of your obviously sincere and 
effective effort to aid the vital work of Food Conservation. 

It is becoming increasingly evident day by day that food will 
win the war, and it is largely through the work of women like 
yourself and your associates that food will be effectively used to 
sustain the health and efficiency of our allies and our own people. 

U. S. Food Administration, 
States Division Department. 

Dr. Anna Howard Shaw, Chairman Woman's Committee Coun- 
cil National Defense, says in her letter from Washington: 
I think your plan a good one. It should be carried out without 



Preface 9 

delay because more and more we are going to be restricted as to 
the quality and kinds of food we can use. The sooner we obtain 
definite information with good recipes, the better it will be for 
us all. 

Mrs. George Gellhorn. Chairman Woman's Central Committee 
on Food Conservation and State Chairman Woman's Committee, 
says: 

It is with the greatest interest that I have heard of your plan 
for a conservation cook book. The ability with which your Com- 
mittee is handling this matter justifies me in the belief that the 
work will be a real contribution to food conservation in this state 
and trust throughout the country. I congratulate you and assure 
you every sort of co-operation in my power as State and City 
Chairman of Foods and give you my hearty endorsement and con- 
gratulations. 

The Food Administration of St. Louis, in writing says:- 
The Food Administration of St. Louis heartily endorse your 
"Win the War" Cook Book. This should be a very valuable medium 
for informing the housewife how she can demonstrate her patriot- 
ism in her home. 

F. B. Mumford, Federal Food Administrator for Missouri, writes 
to the Chairman of the Committee: 

This war will not be won by the last 500,000 fighting men but 
by the last 500,000 bushels of wheat. We are under the impelling 
necessity of conserving wheat, meat, fat and sugar. 

Any educational movement which will result in saving any of 
these vital war food products has the full endorsement of the 
United States Food Administration. Enclosed I am sending you 
some recipes which are authorized by the United States Food Ad- 
ministration. 

Mrs. Geo. A. Still, President of the Missouri Federation of 
Woman's Clubs, says: 

It gives me great pleasure to add my name to the distinguished 
number of men and women who have endorsed the "Win the War" 
Cook Book. I hope the book may have the sale it deserves.

Measurements 11 

MEASUREMENTS 

Level measurements make exact recipes possible because the 
quantity measured is uniform, the same table may be used for 
solids and liquids, and measures can be easily divided. 

A spoonful is a spoon level full. Use a straight-edged knife 
or the spatula to obtain a level surface. Half a spoonful is a 
spoonful divided lengthwise. One-fourth of a spoonful is a half 
spoonful divided crosswise, the division line a little nearer the 
handle end of the bowl. 

A cupful is a cup level full. Fill the cup and level the top 
with a spatula knife. 

Do not shake or press down dry material, as flour or sugar. 
Measure flour after sifting once. To measue a fat, as butter, 
by the cupful, pack solidly and level. To measure less than one- 
half cupful, use a tablespoon. Pack solidly into the spoon and 
level. 

A speck is that which may be held on the tip of a vegetable knife.

"A LESSON IN BUYING" 

Yet another method of studying food value is to be found in a 
consideration of weight; cost and measure. Such a common com- 
modity as potatoes, of course, are always purchased by weight, 
but it is very important to realize that there are 15 pounds of 
potatoes in a peck and that these 15 pounds also represent about 
50 medium-sized potatoes. In other v/ords, if the housekeeper 
buys a pound of potatoes she will get three medium-sized pota- 
toes, and a little one thrown in for full weight. A pound of 
prunes may be ordered without any special interest by the 
woman buyer, and she may get either large or small prunes, de- 
pending upon the grocer's wishes, while a wise buyer would 
stipulate the size wanted because she would know that in a pound 
of small prunes she would get about 40 prunes, while if they were 
large there would be about 28. . 

The following table shows the relation of weight and measure 
and also brings about the difference in the weight of contents 
of the cans of different sizes. In the case of canned pork and beans, 
the No. 1 can, cost 15 cents, weighs 11 ounces, while the No. 2 



Lesson in Buying 13 

can, cost 20 cents, weighs 21 ounces. In the latter can, the cost 
of the additional 10 ounces is 5 cents. If the housekeeper used 
condensed milk in quantity it is better for her to buy the 16 
ounce can, as the cost per ounce is much less than if she purchases 
the 6 ounce can. Of course, it may be better economy for the 
woman to buy the No. 2 can of vegetables, but this is true only 
when the No. 2 can gives her exactly enough for one meal for her 
family. If there is a serving left over, it is evidently wiser for 
her to buy the No. 3 can, because then she has enough for two 
meals and with different methods of preparation, will run no risk 
of monotony. 

It seems clear, then, that several elements enter into intelli- 
gent buying of food. One who enlists in that service ought to 
have a clear conception of the relation of these units of weights, 
cost and measures.

MEAL PLANS 

Study your meals. Plan them for at least three days in ad- 
vance. This helps you to buy to better advantage, gives variety 
in material and preparation. 

Ask yourself the following questions about your meal: 

Does this plan mean 

1. The use of home-grown products and thus allow the rail- 
roads to be hauling supplies for the army instead of food for 
my family? 

2. The exchange of milk, cheese, eggs, fish, game and partial 
exchange of beans, nuts and peas for beef, mutton, pork? Beans, 
nuts and peas are not meat substitutes, but meat savers. Soy 
bean is an exception. 

3. The use of barley, buckwheat, corn, oats, potatoes and rye 
instead of wheat? 

4. Plenty of whole milk for the children and, if possible, for 
adults ? 

5. Twelve ounces of fat per adult per week and six ounces 
per child per week? 

6. The substitution of honey, molasses, corn syrup or other 
syrup for sugar, so as to reduce the amount of sugar used to 
three pounds or less per person per month? 

7. Meals adapted to the season and pocketbook? 

U. S. Food Administration. ' 

FOLLOW THESE DIRECTIONS 

The Food Administration asks everyone to maintain rigidly a 
minimum of at least: 

ONE WHEATLESS day each week and one WHEATLESS 
MEAL each day; the wheatless day to be Wednesday. By wheat- 
less we mean eat no wheat products. 

ONE MEATLESS day each week which shall be Tuesday, and 
one MEATLESS MEAL each day. By meatless we mean to eat 
no red meat beef, pork, mutton, veal, lamb; no preserved meat 
beef, bacon, ham, or lard. 

SUGAR You can materially reduce sugar by reducing the use 
of candy and sweet drinks. We will make every endeavor to see 
that the country is provided with a supply of household sugar on 
the basis of three pounds of sugar for each person per month. 
Do not consume more. U. S. Food Administration. 



Food Groups 15 

CALENDAR OF PATRIOTIC SERVICE 

SUNDAY One wheatless meal, one meatless meal.

Sherman. 

Note: Use whole wheat flour instead of white flour because it 
has more food value, and helps in the conservation value of the 
whole grain. 

Use graham flour with white flour to restore food value to 
white flour. 

However, the use of whole wheat and graham flours is not re- 
garded as saving wheat. 

Note: The changes which take place in the foodstuffs after 
they have been absorbed from the digestive tract are included 
under the general term "metabolism." 



Wheat Substitutes 



Housekeepers are asking why they are requested to substitute 
corn for wheat flour. Because of the countries allied with us 
only Italy raises corn and is accustomed to its use. War time 
is not a good time to try to introduce a new product. Besides, 
there is practically no corn-milling machinery in Europe except 
in Italy, and corn meal can not be shipped in large quantities 
owing to the fact that it spoils readily. The whole problem can 
be met if our loyal housewives will substitute one pound of corn 
or other cereal flour per week per person. We all like corn; a 
very trifling change in our diet will release for our Allies mil- 
lions of bushels of wheat. 

HERBERT HOOVER. 

Note: Subject to change, just now we are required to buy with 
every pound of flour one pound of other cereal. 

Modify Your Own Recipes 

If you have good recipes for bread of any kind make them con- 
form to food conservation by omitting sugar (using substitutes) 
and animal fats (using vegetable fats) and by using one-fourth 
wheat substitute. 

Try for yourself with your own recipe. 

Many people think milk is necessary for good bread, but it is 
not, although it, of course, adds to the food value, and is there- 
fore advisable when it can be afforded. Water, milk 'and water, 
whey, potato water or rise water may be used for the liquid. 

Use white potatoes, sweet potatoes, rice, squash and pumpkin 
as substitutes for the wheat flour. 

Those who can save more than the one-fourth will help make up 
for those who cannot, or are not willing to do their share. 

A fair bread can be rmde on a 50-50 basis. 

YEAST BREAD 

You must know that in using substitutes in the making of War 
Bread that about two-thirds of the mixture should be wheat or 
rye flour. These are the only two of the cereals which contain 
gluten, which is a protein substance, which gives strength to the 



18 "Win the War" Cook Book 

dough, and holds the expansion made by the use of leavening. 
The gluten which is in the dough retards the escape of the 
carbon dioxide and the tension of the warm gas, produced by 
the action of the yeast, expands the cells; then the dough is puffed 
up and becomes light and spongy. 

In the raising of bread, the conditions should be favorable, 
first, for the breaking of starch by the diastase into a variety of 
sugar, and second, by the action of the yeast, a part of the sugar 
is changed into carbon dioxide and alcohol. 

In the manipulation of the dough, extreme cleanliness is neces- 
sary. The dough should be a smooth, uniform, well aerated mix- 
ture, which may be obtained by thorough beating, light, firm 
kneading. It should be kept at the temperature most favorable 
to the growth of the yeast plant (77-95 F.; 25-35 C.) until the 
gas produced by the yeast in growth has leavened the mixture 
double its bulk. Kneading down occasionally will, by stretching 
the gluten, increase the feathery appearance of the crumb. 

It is then molded into loaves to fit an individual loaf tin 
(9 1 /^x4 1 /^x3 1 /^) and carefully pressed into the corners of the tin 
to assure straight edges. The loaves are set in a warm place 
till the expansion of the gas has raised them double their bulk, 
and then baked in an oven heated to the temperature of 350-570 F. 
The oven should not be too hot at first until the crust is set, 
which should take the first 15 minutes. During this time the 
heat should be gradually diminished to prevent too thick and 
too brown a crust before baking is accomplished. This will take 
50 to 60 minutes to cook the starch and destroy the yeast in the 
center of the loaf. 

On taking from the oven, the bread should be cooled in cur- 
rents of air and then put away, without wrapping, in a closed tin 
or earthen jar.

65 to 70 F.) and at 80 r F., if the time is to be shortened. When 
this sponge is so light that the slightest touch causes it to fall 
it is ready for the addition of the ingredients. 

2. Stir the corn meal into the remaining cup of salted water 
and heat to the boiling point over the direct flame. Cook 20 
minutes in a double boiler or over hot water. Cool until it feels 
warm to the hand (about 90 to 95 F.). 

3. Beat the cooked corn meal into the light sponge pre- 
pared as directed above. Add gradually sufficient flour t6 make 
a dough somewhat stiffer than for ordinary bread. It is impos- 
sible to give the quantity of flour exact because different sam- 
ples of flour may not absorb the same amounts of liquid. Knead 
a few minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. 

Continue according to general directions for making yeast bread. 

Short Process Cook the corn meal in 1% cups of liquid, cool to 
about 90 F., add the yeast softened in the remaining *4 cup of 
liquid (or the liquid yeast) and flour to make a stiff dough. Pro- 
ceed from this point as directed above.

POTATO BREAD 

114 cups mashed potatoes % to a /4 yeast cake softened in 

(packed solid), 2 tbsp. lukewarm, water. 

1% tsp. salt, 2% cups flour (more or less flourmay be needed), 

Note: Mashed sweet potato or cooked cereal or squash may bs 
used in the same way as the Irish potato. In using any sub- 
stitute which has a marked flavor it is better to try the bread 
first with less than 1 1 A cups and add more liquid. Squash rolls 
are very good. 

Long Process Cool the mashed potatoes to lukewarm, add the 
salt and the yeast softened in the warm water and about J 4 cup 
of flour. Mix well, cover and let rise until very light. To the 
well-risen sponge, add the remaining flour, kneading thoroughly. 
The dough should be very stiff, as it softens considerably in ris- 
ing. Cover and let rise until double in bulk. Shape into a loaf, 
cover, let rise again until it has increased 2 1 / times in bulk, and 
bake. 

Short Process Follow the directions as given above, but add 
all the flour at once. The dough in this case is so stiff that it 
is difficult to work in all the flour. U. S. Food Administration.

Miss J. Crowder, 
Domestic Science Instructor Central High School. 

YEAST 

Because of the high price of yeast it may be economical when 
bread is made frequently and in large quantities to prepare yeast. 

In making the bread the amount of yeast used, of whatever 
kind, will depend upon the time in which the process is to be 
carried through. 

LIQUID YEAST 

4 medium-sized potatoes, 1 cake dry yeast softened in 

1 qt. hot water, \i cup warm water, or 1 cake 

1 tsp. salt, of compressed yeast, 

14 cup sugar. 



24 "Win the War" Cook Book 

Wash, pare and cook the potatoes in the water, drain, mash, 
and return to the water, -make up to one quart. Add the sugar 
and salt and allow the mixture to cool. When lukewarm add the 
yeast. Keep at room temperature (65 to 70 F.) for 24 hours 
before using. If kept for a longer time it should be poured into 
a sterilized jar and put in a dark, cool place. 

BREAD TESTS 

(1) Will your dough stick to the board without the use of 
flour? 

If it does, then more flour must be kneaded into the dough 
to make it the right consistency. 

(2) Does your dough have blisters on the surface? 
If so, you have kneaded it enough. 

(3) Cut the dough to see if the air is evenly distributed 
throughout the mass. 

If it is not, continue the kneading. 

(4) Knead for about 15 to 20 minutes the first kneading. The 
last kneading must be of short duration, otherwise you will drive 
off the gas formed in the raising of the dough. 

HOW TO CONSERVE WHEAT 

Cut the loaf on the table, and only as required. 

Do not have stale bread. 

If any breads, muffins, gems are left from meals, toast and 
use with creamed fish or left over bits of meat, fish or vegetable. 

If there are bits of bread left, dry and grind, put in cheese 
cloth bag, using the crumbs in scalloped dishes, croquettes and 
as substitute for wheat flour in breads and puddings. 

Do not use crackers made from wheat (or graham) flour. 

Do not use breakfast cereals made from wheat. 

If you use macaroni, spaghetti, any Italian paste or noodles, 
remember that it is made of wheat and do not serve bread at 
the same meal. 

Use corn starch or rice flour for thickening sauces and gravies 
and in puddings (use half as much as you would of flour). 

Remember bread made of mixed flours is better body build- 
ing material than that made from one grain alone. 

"Have at least one wheatless meal a day. Use corn, oats, 
barley, or mixed cereal rolls, muffins and breads in place of 



Wheat Substitutes 25 

white bread certainly for one meal and, if possible, for two. Eat 
less cake and pastry. As to white b^ead, if you must buy from a 
baker, order it a day in advance; then he will not bake beyond 
his needs. Use stale bread for toast and cooking." 

Substitute potatoes when they are plentiful for all bread in 
two meals a day.

CHIEF PROTEINS OF WHITE FLOUR 

Gliaden: gives elasticity to the dough. 

Gluten: gives strength to hold up the expansion made by the 
use of leavenings. 

QUICK BREADS AS WHEAT SAVERS 

Many processes have been devised for making dough light 
without the use of yeast; the object of these is to shorten time 
and labor. 

PROCESS OF LEAVENING 

1. By air expansion with heat and jnoisture. 
Ex. Eggs beaten to a froth. 

2. By steam expansion of dough by application of. sudden heat 

in oven. 
Ex. Popovers. 

3. By chemical reaction (formation of carbon dioxide gas). 
1 Soda (alkali) and molasses (acid). 

2 Soda (alkali) and sour milk (lactic acid). 
3 Soda (alkali) and cream of tartar (acid). 

4. Commercial baking powder (three classes). 

1 Cream of tartar powders or tartrate powders. 
2 Phosphate powders. 
3 Alum powders. 

Note: The carbon dioxide gas which is formed in the above re- 
actions expands with heat and moisture, making the bread light.

Rye flour or 1 cup of barley and 1 cup of wheat may be used 
in this recipe if the liquid is reduced to 1 or l 1 ^ cups. The buck- 
wheat flour absorbs more liquid than other flours. 

If you can get flour, barley flour, rye meal, peanut flour, soy 
bean meal, a great variety of muffins can be made. Combinations 
of one-third barley flour, one-third corn flour and one-third wheat 
flour, or one-half rye meal, one-fourth corn meal and one-fourth

CEREALS 

Corn meal, oatmeal, rice, hominy (grits). These are much 
cheaper than the "ready-to-eat" breakfast foods. A "ready-to- 
eat" breakfast food may cost 15 cents for a big package, but if 
the package contains only one-quarter pound 60 cents a pound 
for cereal! This is eight or ten times as expensive as corn meal 



Wheat Substitutes 



33 



at 6 or 7 cents a pound. Look for the weights printed on the 
package and get the most for your money. 

Corn meal mush and oatmeal are good only when well cooked. 
Many people use too little salt and don't cook them long enough. 

All cereals should be cooked in a double boiler; one can be im- 
provised by setting a pail or pan into a kettle of water. Cereals 
for breakfast may be cooked the day before, but should not be 
stirred while reheating. A tablespoonful or two of cold water on 
top will prevent a hard skin from forming while standing. All 
prepared cereals are better if cooked for a longer time than the 
package directions indicate. It is hardly possible to cook any 
grain too long. The fireless cooker is especially valuable for 
cooking cereals, but a longer period of time must be allowed than 
for cooking in a double boiler.

CEREALS 

Cereals act as fuel to let you do your work, much as the gaso- 
line burning in an automobile engine makes the car go. This you 
can think of as their chief business. And they are usually your 
cheapest fuel. Besides they give your body some building ma-

CORN MEAL AND MILK 

Do you use corn meal mush for a breakfast food? It is both 
cheap and good. Cooked in skim milk instead of water it is extra 
fine and the food value of the dish is nearly doubled. 

CORN MEAL MUSH 

To cook corn meal mush for five people use l 1 /^ cups corn meal, 
2 teaspoonfuls salt (level), 5 or 6 cups water. Bring salt water to 
a boil. Stir in the corn meal slowly. Don't let it lump. Cook it 
at least 30 minutes. It is better when cooked for three hours, or 
over night. Use a double boiler or a fireless cooker. 

CORN MEAL MUSH WITH CHEESE 

Prepare the mush as in the foregoing recipe and pour into a 
flat, wet pan to cool. When cold, turn out and cut in half-inch 
slices with grated cheese and paprika and bake in a hot oven to a 
delicate brown. This dish possesses all the supplies of a well-bal- 
anced food. The meal supplies carbohydrates; the cheese, the 
protein and some fat. It is a tempting dish, too, which cannot be 
said of all wholesome foods.

OATMEAL 

For oatmeal use 2^ cups rolled oats, 2^ teaspoonfuls salt, 5 or 
6 cups water. Bring the water to a boil, stir the rolled oats slowly 
into the boiling water and cook for one hour, or over night. Eat 
the cereal with milk or syrup or butter or butter substitutes. 

TO BOIL HOMINY 

Soak one cup of hominy in the evening, let it stand over night 
then put on to boil with six cups boiling water, one teaspoonful

salt, and boil slowly all day, stirring occasionally, or put in top 
of double boiler or fireless cooker. The best thing during the cold 
weather is to always have a crock of cold boiled hominy on hand; 
it keeps a week or more in cold place, and is a great help to the 
housekeeper, taking the place of potatoes and bread, besides being 
very wholesome. This serves five adults. 

HOMINY CAKES 

1 cup cracked corn or pearly 2 tsp. salt, 
hominy, 3 tbsp. fat. 

7 cups boiling water, 

Boil the corn and water for % hour, add seasonings, place ves- 
sel over water and cook from six to eight hours. Serve in place 
of potatoes. For the second day put the left over cold hominy 
through the meat grinder, add a beaten egg, a tablespoonful sugar 
and % teaspoonful vanilla; make into cakes, flour and cook in a 
frying pan until delicately browned on both sides. Serve these 
cakes instead of potatoes.

STEAMED RICE 

Cook rice as any whole cereal. The time is 20 minutes, or until 
kernels are soft. Uncover, that steam may escape. When rice is 
steamed for a simple dessert use one-half the quantity of water. 
Steam until rice has absorbed water, then add scalded milk for 
remaining liquid. 

BOILED RICE 

Pick over and wash rice. Add gradually to a large quantity of 
rapidly boiling salted water. Stir at first with a fork to prevent 
any grain from sticking to the bottom of kettle. Let it boil rap- 
idly 20 minutes, or until tender. Drain in strainer, pour over it 
cold water, reheat in oven. Serve plain as a vegetable, or use for 
croquettes, etc. One cupful of rice when cooked will measure 
nearly 4 cups. 

BOILED MACARONI 

Break macaroni in two-inch pieces and cook as boiled rice.

SAUTED MUSH 

Pack hot corn meal mush in wet molds. Cool, and cover to pre- 
vent crust forming. Remove from mold, cut in ^-inch slices and 
saute. If slices are dipped in flour or corn meal sauteing should 
be made thicker, using 4 tablespoonfuls granular cereal to 1 cup 
of water. 

UNPOLISHED RICE 

The hull which is removed in polishing rice is very rich in 
mineral content. It is said that armies fed on polished rice without 
this mineral being supplied by other foods, quickly contract scurvy, 
while those fed on brown or unpolished rice do not have the dis- 
ease. It seems that this most valuable part of the rice is being 
sold as waste stock feed. If this can be bought at 2% cents or 3 
cents per pound, it should be used in large quantities everywhere. 
If this cannot be obtained, then every woman should ask her 
grocer for brown or unpolished rice. 



BARLEY MUSH. 

% cup barley meat, % level tsp. salt.

FRUITED CEREALS 

Note: Oats are among the highest in caloric values of all the 
cereals. 

Figs and dates and raisins are conceded the highest in caloric 
or food value of all the fruits. 

The combination of these cereals and fruits therefore offers 
more nutrition for the money expended than any other staple 
food. 

When cereal is about half cooked, add fruit whole or chopped.

WHY YOU SHOULD USE MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

Meat is bound to be dear. It was scarce and high before the 
war. 

For years the number of people in this country has been in- 
creasing faster than the number of meat animals. Much of the 
open country out West where cattle used to range by hundreds of 
thousands has been fenced into farms. 

Then came anthrax, foot and mouth disease, hog cholera, one 
plague after another. 

Four years ago our government began a great campaign for 
more livestock, just to feed us in peace times. 

War doubles and trebles the demand for our meat. We must 
provide meat for the boys in the trenches. We must stretch our 
meat supply. We must Save Meat to Save Ourselves. 

We can eat fish, it's as hearty as meat. Eat poultry, it does not 
make army rations. Use milk, eggs and cheese, they are almost 
the same as meat. 

Peanut butter and vegetable oils are good fats. Dried beans, 
peas and grains take the place of meat if milk is used with them, 
or cheese or eggs or plenty of green vegetables. 

One ounce of meat a day for every one in the country amounts 
to the meat from 4,400,000 animals in a year. Save your ounce. 
It's a little thing to do to save your country. 

U. S. Food Administration. 



THE EFFECT OF HEAT ON PROTEIN 

Egg albumin or meat albumin serve as good examples to show 
the effect of heat on protein. If heat is applied a gradual process 
of hardening begins at the outer edge of the albumin, and con- 
tinues toward the center in thin lines or fibrils until the transpar- 
ent albumin becomes dense and leathery. This change is known 
as coagulation, and is typical of the change in all protein foods 
as the result of the application of heat. A few simple experi- 
ments will show the eifect of the different temperatures on pro- 
tein. At 134 degrees F. the fine fibrils of a semi-solid white sub- 
stance appear in the liquid albumin. At 160 degrees P. it 



Meat Savers 39 

changes to a tender jelly-like substance. At 180 degrees F. it be- 
comes dense and white. Boiling temperature changes it into a 
tough, leathery substance. Therefore, the higher the temperature 
the tougher and harder the protein; consequently all protein foods 
are best if cooked at as low a temperature as will render them 
palatable. 

LEGUMES AS MEAT SUBSTITUTES 

Dried peas and beans are rich in muscle making principle and 
for this reason are often called the "poor man's beef," of very 
poor quality, about 1 A as good in quality as animal protein, but be- 
cause they are somewhat difficult of digestion, they should not re- 
place animal protein altogether, but should be used with discre- 
tion as meat substitutes. Soy beans are an exception to this. Cereal 
protein is about two times as valuable for growth as beans. No 
matter how dried legumes are to be cooked, they must first be 
soaked over night in cold water, that they may absorb moisture to 
replace that lost in evaporation; after soaking dried legumes may 
be cooked in almost any of the ways which fresh ones are cooked. 
It is then necessary to drain and wash them thoroughly, cooking 
gently until tender in water containing a very little common bak- 
ing soda. This tends to soften the water and hastens the cooking 
process; it also aids in removing excess sulphur. 

There is nothing in all cookery that needs more careful season- 
ing than dried legumes; salt and pepper, lemon rind, nutmeg, 
onion, celery salt, celery leaves, mustard in the right proportions 
may be used. As these legumes are deficient in fats, they should 
be combined with some fatty ingredients to preserve the balance 
salt pork and beans. 

SOY BEANS 

Soy beans are excellent substitutes for meat. They contain al- 
most twice as much protein as beefsteak, and more fat than any 
other of the legumes except the peanut. The protein of the soy 
bean is more nearly like animal protein in value than that of 
other plant foods as far as is now known. The fat contains the 
important growth-promoting fat soluble vitamine. The yellow or 
green varieties are best for eating purposes, the darker varieties 
having an unpleasant strong taste. 



40 "Win the War" Cook Book 

Green soy beans, when three-fourths grown, may be cooked and 
seasoned like the lima bean; change the water once during the 
Booking. 

Dried soy beans should be soaked in 5 per cent salt water 12-16 
hours. Drain, put on to cook in hot water and cook slowly until 
tender (6-8 hours), changing the water often while cooking in 
order to remove the strong flavor.

Nuts as Meat Substitutes 

Nuts vary considerably in composition, some as chestnuts being 
starchy, others as cocoanut and walnuts being especially rich in 
fat, while many as almonds, Brazil nuts, butternuts and peanuts 
are rich in protein and fat. 

The protein of nuts as far as known at present has not the 
value of animal protein. When used with some cheese, milk or 
meat they make an excellent meat substitute. When used with- 
out these they make good meat savers. With the constant ten- 
dency toward higher cost of meat and the necessity of shipping 
meat to our allies and our own soldiers (for they in their exposed 
life need the blood producing elements of meat) and with the 
growing knowledge of nut culture we may look for a much larger 
use of nuts as "meat substitutes." 

lOc spent for beefsteak will buy about 400 calories with almost 
30 gms. protein. 

lOc spent for peanuts would buy about 1800 calories with 90 
gms. protein. 

lOc spent for peanut butter would buy about 750 calories with 
35 gms. of protein. 

Thus nuts are plainly a more economical food from standpoint 
of food value.

Cheese as a Meat Substitute 

Cheese is one of the most valuable of meat substitutes. Whole 
cheese contains about 25 per cent protein and cottage cheese 
about 20 per cent. U. S. Food Administration urges the larger 
manufacture and use of cottage cheese, utilizing the skim milk. 

Cheese is a concentrated form of food. It is rich in both pro- 
tein and fat. In combination with starchy food it may be used as 
a substitute for meat. Experiments have proved that cheese does 
not ordinarily cause indigestion and neither is it a frequent cause 
of constipation. 

A recent compilation describes no less than 350 varieties of 
cheese. 

Cheese is divided into two main types: 

Hard Cheeses: Chedder, Edam, Emmental (or Swiss), 

Parmesan and Roquefort. 

Soft Cheeses: Brie, Camembert, Gorgonzola, Limberg, 

Neufchatel and Stilton. 

FOOD VALUE AS COMPARED TO MEAT 

1 Ib. chedder cheese=2,079 calories 

1 Ib. beef tenderloin=l,290 calories 

1.24 oz. of beef=.77 oz. cheese=100 calories 

3V2 to 5V2 oz. raw meat=usual serving. 

COTTAGE CHEESE 

Cottage cheese is one of the important meat substitutes, say 
specialists of the U. S. Department of Agriculture. It contains a 
larger percentage of protein than most meats and furnishes this 
material at a lower cost. In every pound of cottage cheese there 
is about one-fifth of a pound of protein, nearly all of which is 
digestible. Meats, on the other hand, usually contain less pro- 
tein and, besides, have a certain waste, such as bone and other 
inedible material A pound of cottage cheese daily would supply 
all the protein required by the ordinary adult engaged in a seden- 
tary occupation.

little flavor of their own. Use peppers, onion, garlic, catsup, Wor- 
cestershire sauce, etc., for increasing flavor. Beans and nut 
loaves should be served with highly seasoned sauces. 

Note: Rinds and bits of cheese may be scalded, dried and 
ground for use in any dishes requiring cheese.

Fish as a Meat Substitute 

Eat more fish and sea food to save meat, is the request of our 
Government. The fish products, as estimated by the Bureau of 
Fisheries, amount to 2,169,000,000 pounds in weight. 

Fresh Fish 10 per cent to 14 per cent protein. 

Buying of Fish: 

1. Find the varieties recommended by the United States Gov- 
ernment and ask for them. Insist that your dealer carries them. 
Look up their food value and the best methods for their prepara- 
tion. 

2. In winter use frozen fish. Frozen foods are best cooked be- 
fore thawing them. It is becoming a common practice to pre- 
serve fruits and vegetables by freezing, but they must be used 
before thawing if the quality of the food is to be preserved. 
Frozen fish cooked at once is as delicious as fresh fish, providing 
the fish was originally fresh. 

3. Use fish all the week, so that the demand will be extended 
and it will be possible to get it on other days than Friday. 

4. A large number of perfectly good fish are being wasted each 
year because there is no demand for them. We are too conserva- 
tive and cling to the use of certain well-known varieties, while 
others equally good are not used. 

5. If possible, buy local fish, to avoid shipping. This rule does 
not hold in winter, when it is almost impossible to get river fish. 

POINTS TO BE REMEMBERED IN THE PREPARATION OF 

FISH 

1. Fish is tender; therefore long cooking is not necessary. 

2. Flavor should be retained and added. 

3. Most fish lack fat; therefore the addition of it is desirable 
from the standpoint of food value as well as flavor. 

A fish to be eatable must be perfectly fresh. Nothing else in 
the line of food deteriorates so rapidly. Fresh fish may be pre- 
served frozen by the best cold storage process for at least two 
years, but if once heated and allowed to stand, nothing will bring 
back the delicious flavor of a fish just caught. Fresh fish will be

COURTESY DONNELL 5T. LOUIS GLOBE DEMOCRAT 



Meat Savers 57 

firm and the skin and scales bright. When a fish looks dim and 
limp do not buy it. Fish should be washed quickly in only one 
cold water. Wash whole and cut up for frying after, if fish is to 
be cut in pieces. 

Fish may be baked, broiled, boiled, fried or sauted. Fresh cod, 
lake trout, red snapper, haddock are good boiled. 

TO BOIL FISH 

Pin the fish in a piece of strong white cotton cloth and plunge 
into boiling salt water, let simmer gently for 30 minutes, longer 
or shorter time according to size of fish. Boiled fish may be 
served with a great variety of sauces. 

BOUILLON 

If fish is boiled in the following bouillon it will add greatly to 
its flavor. 

4 qts. of water, 1 tsp. pepper, 

1 onion, 1 tbsp. vinegar, 

1 slice of carrot, Juice Vz lemon, 

2 cloves, Some herb may be used. 
2 tbsp. salt, 

Tie all spices in muslin bag. Cook all together, simmering 
slowly for one hour. Put in the fish and cook as directed for one 
hour. 

BAKED FISH 

Make a dressing of rolled crackers (fine), salt, pepper and 
chopped parsley, a small quantity of chopped salt pork (or but- 
ter substitute will do). 

After fish has been carefully cleansed, rub well with salt, put in 
dressing and sew up the fish. Cut gashes in the sides of fish 
about 1 inch deep and 2 inches long. Fill gashes with strips of 
fat salt pork. Now put the fish into the baking pan, dredge well 
with flour, salt and pepper, cover the bottom of the pan with 
water and put into moderate oven. A five-pound fish should bake 
in about one hour. The fish should be basted about every 15 
minutes. Water must be renewed often as only the bottom of 
pan should be kept covered. Do not allow the pan to burn. When 
done carefully slip the fish into center of hot platter, pour over 



58 "Win the War" Cook Book 

any kind of sauce desired, garnish and serve. It is well. to place 
fish on tin sheet before putting in baking dish; it will then slip 
easily onto platter without breaking. 

SAUTED FISH 

All small fish like brook trout, smelts, perch, cat, are best 
fried. -^ 

When thoroughly cleaned they should be rolled in a mixture of 
flour and Indian meal, thoroughly mixed, salted and peppered. 
Fry brown on one side in shallow vegetable fat or salt pork drip- 
pings, turn carefully, brown and serve on hot platter. Sliced 
fish may be fried in the same manner. Do not burn the fish. 

CREAMED COD FISH 

Buy the large white, boneless steaks of cod, break into small 
pieces, let stand Vz hour in water, drain. 

Make cream sauce, 2 to 1. 

Add fish, let stand over very slow fire until heated through, do 
not boil after fish is added. A beaten egg makes the dish richer. 

1 cup cod fish, 1 egg. 
1% cup cream sauce (2 to 1), 

COD FISH BALLS 

2 pts. raw potatoes, Pepper, 

1 Dound cod fish, 1 tbsp. veg. fat. 
Salt, 

Boil cod fish picked in pieces with potatoes until latter are done, 
mash, beat, add beaten eggs, salt, pepper and fry light brown in 
vegetable oil or butter substitute. 

BAKED SALT FISH 

2 cups salt (flaked), 2 eggs, 

2 cups cold mashed potatoes, 2 to 3 tbsp. of drippings. 
1 pt. milk, 

Soak the flaked fish in cold water over night. Freshen the 
fish by boiling up several times in fresh water (usually three 
times is sufficient). Then simmer until tender. Drain off the 
water, mix the potatoes with the milk, eggs, fat and season- 
ing. Add the fish, turn into a greased baking dish and bake one- 
half hour.

where it joins the tail fin. Follow the bone up, loosening as you 
go. Most of the bones will come out with the backbone. Any 
small bones that are left may be picked out later.

USE SAVORY STEWS AND MEAT PIES 

Do you know how good they are? They may be so varied that 
you can have a different one every day in the week, and all of 
them delicious. It needs only a small piece of meat to give flavor 
to a hearty dish. 

Don't think that you must eat a lot of meat to be strong. Meat 
is good to help build up the body, but so are many other foods. 

In these dishes, part of your building material comes from the 
more expensive meat and part from the cheaper peas, beans, hom- 
iny and barley. The little meat with the vegetables and cereals 
will give your body what it needs. 

U. S. Food Administration. 

TAMALE PIE 

Another good way to use a little meat. Have you ever used 
rice, corn meal mush, or hominy for a crust ? This is less work 
than a pastry crust and saves wheat. 

4 cups cooked corn meal, rice, % tsp. pepper, 

or hominy, 1 tbsp. fat, 

1 onion, 1 pound raw meat or left 

2 cups tomato, over meat cut up small. 

Melt the fat, add the sliced onion, and, if raw meat is used, add 
it, and place over fire until red color disappears. Add the tomato 
and seasoning. If cooked meat is used, add it with the tomato 
and seasoning after the onion is browned, and heat through. 
Grease a baking dish, put in a layer of the cereal, add the meat 
and gravy, and cover with the cereal, dotted with fat. Bake for 
half hour. 

SHEPHERD'S PIE 

This is the name of a meat pie with a mashed potato crust 
browned in the oven.

HOT POT OF MUTTON AND BARLEY 

1 pound mutton, 3 onions, 

V 2 cup pearled barley, Celery tops or other seasoning 

1 tbsp. salt, herbs. 
4 potatoes, 

Cut the mutton in small pieces, and brown with the onion in 
fat cut from meat. This will help the meat tender and improves 
the flavor. Pour this into a covered sauce pan. Add 2 quarts 
water and the barley. Simmer for l 1 /^ hours. Then add the 
potatoes cut in quarters, seasoning, and cook one-half hour longer. 

SCRAPPLE 

2 Ibs. (meat) pork, game, poultry, etc., 
% Ib. liver (beef or pork). 

Cook together till very tender, remove from liquor and grind. 
To liquor add enough water to make 2 quarts, make corn meal 
mush with those 2 quarts, using about 2 cups of meal (must be 
rather thick). When done, add ground meat, salt, pepper, sage, 
allspice to taste. Pour into greased mold. In frying be sure to 
have pan thoroughly heated. Slice pieces from the mold and fry.

SPAGHETTI A L'lTALIENNE 

An excellent dish containing all the food elements necessary for 
substantial meal may be varied. Use left over gravy, bits of meat 
of any kind, rice or vegetables, always using common sense (the 
best ingredients) in cooking. 

1 cup grated cheese, 1 tsp. salt, 
% can tomatoes, y 2 tsp. pepper, 

large onion, 14 Ib. ground beef, 

tbsp. Mazola or veg. oil, 1 cup hot water or milk, 

% bay leaf, Bit of parsley. 

Cook spaghetti 30 minutes, cut onion fine, fry in the oil till 
golden brown, add tomatoes and all other ingredients except 
cheese. Let simmer slowly for 30 minutes or while spaghetti is 
cooking; have baking dish ready. Place alternate portions of spa- 
ghetti, sauce and cheese, cover with bread crumbs and bake 15 
minutes.

STUFFED MUSHROOMS A LA BRADFORD 

Select a dozen large mushrooms, peel them and remove the 
stems. Make a forcemeat from the following ingredients: Use 
the mushroom stems and three whole mushrooms. Chop fine and 
saute in butter for three minutes. Add one-half cup of bread 
crumbs which have been moistened with chicken stock. Season 
with salt, pepper and 1 tbsp. of tomato catsup. Fill the large 
mushrooms with this mixture. Crumb, and bake about fifteen 
minutes. Serve on toast surrounded by a brown sauce, flavored 
with sherry. 

BEEF STEW 

1 Ib. beef, *A peck green peas or 1 can, 

4 potatoes, 1 cup carrots cut up small. 

1 tsp. salt, 

Cut meat in small pieces and brown in the fat from the meat. 
Simmer in 2 quarts of water for 1 hour. Add the peas and car- 
rots and cook for one-half hour, then add the potatoes. If canned 
peas are used add them 10 minutes before serving. Serve when 
potatoes are done. 

Variations. 1. The meat. This may be any kind and more 
or less than a pound may be used. Use the cheap cuts, the flank, 
rump, neck or brisket. The long, slow cooking makes them 
tender; game and poultry are good. 

2. Potatoes and barley may be used or barley alone or rice, 
hominy or macaroni. 

3. Vegetables carrots, turnips, onions, peas, beans, cabbage, 
tomatoes are good canned or fresh. Use one or more of these as 
you wish. 

4. Parsley, celery tops, onion tops, seasoning herbs or chopped 
sweet peppers add to the flavor. 

5. Many left-overs may be used, not only meat and vegetables, 
but rice or hominy. 

U. S. Food Administration. 

The fireless cooker may well be used, the meat and the vege- 
tables being put in at the same time. Left-overs or canned vege- 
tables need only to be heated through. Add them 15 minutes be- 
fore serving.

Soups That Save 

An Overlooked Economy 

Many housekeepers throw away the water in which vegetables 
have been boiled, unmindful of the fact that somewhat less 
than a third of the contained mineral matter and about the same 
amount of starchy and protein substances are dissolved out into 
this water, which may well be utilized for soup. For instance, the 
water in which cabbage has been cooked requires only the addition 
of a little milk, butter and thickening to furnish an agreeable 
thin soup. 



In this connection it may be noted that much nutriment is also 
lost in the water in which vegetables are soaked in order to re- 
store them to freshness, an excellent reason why wilted products 
should not be bought, and for the same reason vegetables should 
be covered with boiling water, not tepid, and the cooking started 
without delay. While such vegetables are thought to taste better 
if cooked in a large amount of water, they should be just scalded or 
parboiled, this water thrown away, and the cooking concluded in a 
small quantity of water or by steaming. 

Since one of the great ends of cooking is the production of 
flavor, we should place high in our list those cheapest of all 
flavors which result from browning. Toasted bread or croutons is 
a favorite addition to soups, but many housekeepers do not seem 
to know that toasting or parching gives a new flavor to rice, or if 
applied to the highly flavored vegetables used to season soups, re- 
sults in new and delicious flavoring substances as carmelized onion, 
carrot, celery, green pepper, etc. 

Cream soups are in place only at luncheon or at supper because 
they are so heavy that they partly satisfy the appetite. To this 
end they should be recognized as having actual food value, while 
the clear soup that appears at dinner is used more as a stimulant 
to the appetite. A cream soup is always bland in taste and should 
be followed by some strong flavored dish of firm texture. Creamed 
chicken is too similar to harmonize with cream soup; croquettes or 
salads would give a better effect. Cream soups are in place at 
dinners if used as a meat substitute.

SOUP MADE FROM LEFT-OVERS 

Put bones and pea pods in water and boil until all of the flavor 
has come out into the water, remove bones and water. Put 
through meat grinder any small amount of left over food which 
does not contain bananas or is very sweet. Add to the above 
stock, cook thoroughly, strain and season. 

CORRECT PROPORTIONS FOR A WHITE SAUCE FOR 

SOUPS 

1 tbsp. fat, 1 tbsp. flour. 

1 cup milk or soup stock, 

Soups can be thickened with stale bread, which makes it possible 
to utilize still another food, sometimes thrown away. Half a slice 
of bread, or about 1 A ounce of bread, is enough to thicken one cup 
of soup. 

THE FOLLOWING IS A TYPICAL RECIPE 

1 head lettuce, 1 large slice stale bread, 

1 small sliced onion, Veg. fat if desired, 

2 qts. skim milk, Salt and pepper. 

Put the lettuce and onion through the meat chopper with the 
bread to save the juice. Put into a double boiler with the skim 
milk and cook until the lettuce is soft. Add fat (if desired) and 
the salt and pepper.

CREAM OF VEGETABLE SOUPS 

Cream vegetable soups are nutritious and are a palatable dish 
to serve for luncheon or supper. Great care should be used in 
combining acid vegetables, such as tomatoes with milk, as the milk 
may curdle and spoil the texture of the dish. A very small quan- 
tity of soda added to the puree (strained vegetable pulp) will 
neutralize the acid, and then it may be added to the milk. 
General Directions. 

Cook vegetables until soft, strain the vegetables and keep the 
stock in which they are cooked. Make a thin white sauce, using 
1 tablespoonful butter, 1 tablespoonful flour, y 2 teaspoonful salt 
and % teaspoonful pepper to 1 cup liquid (milk or stock or part 
of each), add the strained vegetable (puree) to the white sauce, 
then reheat and serve at once. Onion or other seasoning vege- 
tables may be used.

and trimmings with cold water and let simmer for one-half hour. 
Cook the onion in the fat for 5 minutes, then pour into a stew 
pan. Parboil the sliced potatoes for 5 minutes, then drain and add 
layers of fish and potatoes to the fat and onion in the stew pan. 
Season each layer with salt and pepper. Strain the liquor in 
which the fish bones have been cooking over all and cook about 20 
minutes until fish and potatoes are tender. Then add the scalded 
milk. If desired thicker, sprinkle a little corn meal between each 
layer of fish and potatoes.

and when scalding hot put milk and oyster liquor together. Add 
oysters and let them come to a boil. 

Helen Labagh Johnson. 

Note: Celery leaves may be dried and used in soups. Use 
water in which vegetables have been cooked for soup and gravies, 
as it contains nutritive value. Have a soup pot; add bones from 
steak, roast pork, fowls, etc., after bones have been scalded. Bones 
are valuable as fertilizer, containing the elements Calcium and 
Phosphorus. 



VEGETABLES 

It may be said in general that no meat or vegetable should be 
cooked longer than is necessary to soften the connective tissue or 
the cellulose. Sometimes only a very short time is needed to de- 
velop flavor, while long cooking may wholly change this flavor. 
Shredded cabbage, for instance, cooked a half hour, has become 
tender, and has a good color and flavor; if the cooking is con- 
tinued for three hours, as is the custom in the German kitchen, its 
color darkens and its flavor has become at least to the American 
palate strong and disagreeable. The importance of not over-cook- 
ing applies to all tender succulent young growths, as peas, beans, 
asparagus, spinach. If, when cooked, their serving is unavoid- 
ably delayed they should be closely covered and kept in a water 
bath; while starchy vegetables, as rice and potatoes, should be 
covered under the lid with a cloth which will absorb the steam 
that might otherwise fall back to make the vegetables sodden. 



PLANNING VEGETABLES FOR A MEAL 

In planning the main portion one rule is invalid: potatoes, rice 
and spaghetti should never appear in the same meal, because they 
are too similar. When two vegetables are to be served, one should 
be green, like asparagus or string beans, and one of more plebeian 
character, like onions or beets. 



80 "Win the War" Cook Book 

METHODS OF COOKING VEGETABLES 

TO BOIL 

Wash, pare, peel or scrape the vegetables, cut into pieces of con- 
venient size, cover with boiling salted water, using 1 teaspoonful 
of salt to 1 pint of water. Cook until tender, drain and dry. 

Great loss of food substance in the water in which vegetables 
are cooked, including starch, protein and mineral salts, all of 
which are valuable in the diet. The water in which vegetables 
have been boiled should be used for soups, sauces, etc. 

2. Steaming Better method than boiling because the loss of 
food material is much less. 

3. Baking Best method for vegetables suitable for baking, as 
there is no loss of food material. 

4. Sauteing Recommended for variety. 

5. Scalloping Recommended for variety. 

6. Frying in deep fat not recommended on account of scarcity 
of fat. 

GENERAL PRINCIPLES UNDERLYING BOILING 

VEGETABLES 

1. Cook all vegetables uncovered after they reach the boiling 
point. 

a. To retain color.. 

b. To lessen odor of cooking. 

c. To allow undesirable compounds to escape in steam. 

2. Cook all fresh vegetables in boiling salted water. 

ROOTS, LEAVES, STALKS, ETC. 

Carrots Contain no true starch, 2.5 per cent of pectose 
gum, etc., 4.5 per cent sugar, 0.5 per cent albuminoids and 89 per 
cent water. When carrots are boiled they lose over 90 per cent of 
their nutrient material. This fact suggests that to retain any 
food value at all, carrots should be cooked in a soup or stew. 

Parsnips 3.5 per cent of starch, 5 per cent of sugar, 3.7 per 
cent of gum pectose, 1.5 per cent fat, 1.2 per cent of albuminoids 
and only 82 per cent of water. It loses a large amount of nutrient 
material in boiling. 

Turnips Contain 92.8 per cent of water, 3 per cent of pectose 
and extractives. They contain more water than milk. They are 
of little value except for their flavor and to furnish variety to 
the bill of fare. 



Meat Savers 81 

Beets Are a more important food than any of those just men- 
tioned, for the ordinary garden beet has been cultivated so that 
it contains from 10 to 15 per cent of cane sugar. Beets also con- 
tain 2.4 per cent of pectose and more cellulose than the other 
roots. The addition of vinegar to boiled beets helps to soften the 
cellulose and it is said does not interfere with the digestion of the 
other carbohydrates. After beets are boiled they contain only 3 
per cent sugar. 

Leaves and Stalks As celery, lettuce, etc., though they contain 
over 90 per cent water, yet their value should not be overlooked, 
for the gluten and starch which they contain are often in such a 
condition that they can be readily assimilated. Prominent among 
foods of this class should be mentioned the cabbage, cauliflower 
and kale. 

Cabbage Contains 5.8 per cent of carbohydrates, 1.8 per cent 
of nitrogenous matter and 1.3 per cent of mineral matter, but 
when cooked the per cent of water is increased to 94.4 per cent 
and other constituents decrease in like proportion. (In general, 
it may be said that the effect of cooking is greatly diminished in 
the amount of nutrients in this class of foods.) 

CREAMED VEGETABLES 

Use -potatoes, turnips, celery, onion, cabbage, cauliflower, beets, 
parsnips, salsify, brussels, sprouts, carrots, etc. 

Make a white sauce, using equal portions fat and flour or two 
tablespoonfuls to one cup hot milk, melt fat, stir flour into it until 
it makes a smooth paste, add hot milk and salt and pepper to 
taste, and stir constantly until it thickens. 

One-half as much cornstarch may be used for thickening in- 
stead of flour. 

Put a layer of vegetables and a layer of cream sauces until the 
baking of casserole is full. Cover top with buttered bread crumbs 
and brown in oven. Grated cheese may be added between the 
layers when vegetables which do not have strong flavors are used. 

VEGETABLE SOUFFLES 

These dishes are a good way to combine eggs and vegetables. 
If made with the green-shelled legumes (peas, beans, soy beans or 
cow-peas) they may be considered meat savers. Corn starch or 



82 "Win the War" Cook Book 

rice flour should be used for thickening sauces. Use half as much 
as you would of wheat flour. 

"~1~ A thick sauce made with ^4 cup fat, */4 cup flour and 1 cup 
liquid, which may be milk (whole or skim), cream, meat stock or 
the water in which vegetables have been cooked. 

2. One cup thick vegetable pulp made by draining cooked vege- 
tables and then mashing them or putting them through a sieve. 

3. Three eggs, the whites and yolks beaten separately. 

4. Flavoring, salt, pepper, onion juice and any one of the fol- 
lowing may be used: Very finely chopped parsley, chives, or one- 
eighth teaspoon curry powder. Mix the vegetables, pulp, season- 
ing sauce, and well-beaten egg yolks. Carefully fold in the well- 
beaten egg whites of the eggs, put into a buttered baking dish 
and bake in a slow oven until firm. Serve immediately. 

The amount of vegetables in this dish may be increased by 
serving vegetables around the souffle. 

VEGETABLE FRITTERS 

Mash cooked vegetables, such as salsify, parsnips, carrots, etc., 
season with butter substitute, salt and pepper, shape into small 
flat, round cakes, roll in flour and saute in vegetable oil or sub- 
stitute for butter. 

SCALLOPED CORN 

2 cups or 1 can corn, 2 tbsp. fat. 
1 tsp. salt, Vz cup crumbs, 

1 cup milk, 1 tbsp. fat, 

VB tsp. pepper, Speck salt. 

Mix the corn, milk, seasonings and the melted fat. 

Place in greased baking dish with buttered crumbs over top 
and bake in moderate oven until crumbs are brown. 

To prepare crumbs, melt butter substitute, stir the crumbs into 
it and add salt. 

SAUTED CORN 

Cut boiled sweet corn from cob and saute in vegetable oil or 
fat. 

SOY BEAN FRITTERS 

Soy bean meal may be made into fritters and sauted.

Potatoes in their simplest forms baked and boiled make a 
good dish for luncheon or dinner. But there are numerous ways 
in which they may be prepared which gives pleasing variety. 

A potato is done when a fork will pierce easily. 

POTATOES AU GRATIN (see Cheese) 

POTATO BREAD (see Breads) 

Potatoes diced may be used in all meat stews, such as chicken, 
pork, rabbit, mutton, etc. 

SAUTED POTATOES (Raw) 

Peel and slice thin the raw potatoes, have in skillet hot l 1 /^ 
tbsp. of fat Mazola or other vegetable oil. Put in potatoes, cover 
tighty, stir often with thin knife or spatula to keep from burn- 
ing. Serve very hot. The left over cold potatoes may be treated 
in the same way, taking less time to prepare. Cold potatoes may 
also be diced and put into hot cream sauce with chopped parsley. 

SARATOGA POTATOES 

Slice potatoes thin. A pretty effect is to slice around and round 
in form of shavings. Let stand in very cold water for % hour; a 



84 "Win the War" Cook Book 

bit of alum added to water will make them firm. Let drain, wipe 
dry with soft towel. Fry a few at a time in deep kettle of fat, 
take up into hot dish with wire basket or perforated skimmer 
when light brown. Serve hot. 

RICED POTATOES 

Riced potatoes are very pleasing; simply press the mashed po- 
tatoes through potato ricer. Mashed potatoes put into pudding 
dish with cheese or Mazola smoothed over and browned in oven 
are very nice. 

FRENCH FRIED 

Wash, peel and cut potatoes into lengthwise sections about 
V2 in. thick, dry between soft towel, fry a few at a time in deep 
vegetable oil, drain on paper, sprinkle with salt. Serve very hot 
with meat sausage; especially nice for breakfast or luncheon. 

MASHED POTATOES 

May be delicious or impalatable "why not the former?" 
Pare potatoes carefully, let stand for short time in cold water, 
drain and put in stew kettle with sufficient boiling water to cover. 
Cook till thoroughly done, drain, let stand a moment uncovered 
on fire to dry. Mash thoroughly, beat till creamy with a little 
hot cream or miik and salt and Mazola or other butter substitute. 
Serve hot. 

SCALLOPED POTATOES 

Peel and slice raw potatoes, cover baking dish with vegetable 
fat, put in layer of potatoes, salt, pepper, a little Mazola and 
minced onion if liked. Sprinkle over a little rice flour or powdered 
arra-root. Another layer of potatoes, etc., until the dish is filled. 
Pour over a good thin cream sauce and bake S A hour. 

POTATOES SAUTED 

Boil, skin, brown in fat, sprinkle with salt. 

STUFFED POTATOES 

6 potatoes, l /z cup milk, 

% tsp. salt, x /4 lb. grated cheese, 

% tsp. pepper, 1 egg, if desired. 

Select medium-sized potatoes. Wash well, dry, bake in hot 
oven about % hour or until soft. Remove from oven and at once 



Meat Savers 85 

slice off top or cut in half, but do not otherwise break skin. 
Scoop out inside with spoon, mash, add salt, pepper, hot milk, 
beat in grated cheese and egg. Return to shell, bake 10 minutes. 
Boiled potatoes may be mashed and prepared same way and 
piled as a cone on dish and baked 10 to 15 minutes. 

Mary Sherzer. 

SWEET POTATOES GEORGIAN STYLE 

Season mashocl boiled sweet potatoes with butter substitute, 
salt, pepper and sherry wine. Moisten with cream or milk and 
beat 5 minutes, put in a greased baking dish, leaving a rough 
surface. Pour over a syrup made of boiling two tablespoons of 
molasses and one teaspoonful fat 5 minutes. Bake until deli- 
cately browned. 

Notes: Eat skins of Irish and sweet potatoes, as they contain 
"growth determiners" or vitamines. 

Boil potatoes with skins on them this saves waste. 

Apply this note to above recipes. Vary recipes by always season- 
ing with common sense. 

Mashed potatoes, may be used in place of biscuit crust in mak- 
ing meat pies. 

Sweet potatoes may be used in much the same way as white 
potatoes. 

SPINACH 

Use one-fourth peck of spinach, remove roots, carefully pick 
over (discarding wilted leaves) and wash under running water to 
free from all grains of sand. Put in a stew pan, allow to heat 
gradually and boil 25 minutes or until tender in its own juice. 
Drain thoroughly, chop finely, reheat and season with 3 table- 
spoonfuls butter substitute, salt and pepper. Form in pleasing 
shape on serving dish and garnish with slices of hard cooked egg. 

CORN FRITTERS 

1 cup flour, 2 rounded tsp. baking powder, 
Vz cup milk. 1 tsp. salt, 

2 eggs, % tsp. pepper, 

1 tbsp. Mazola, 1 cup grated or chopped corn. 

Sift flour, baking powder, salt and pepper into bowl, add milk, 
well beaten eggs, Mazola and grated corn, or if canned corn is 
used put it through meat chopper, and mix well and fry in deep 
hot vegetable oil.

Milk 

The world is desperately hard up for butter and milk. For 
small children nothing can take the place of milk and butter; 
they die if they don't get them. For grown folks they are next 
to meat. 

Milk from the cow is almost a complete food. Skim milk is 
nearly the same in food value as lean meat. One quart of milk 
has more fuel value than half a pound of good beefsteak, and 
more than eight eggs. Milk contains vitamines and much lime, 
which makes it a food for growing children. 

Before the war we had a hard problem to get milk enough. Now 
we are sending ten times as much condensed milk to Europe as 
we did five years ago. 

Our Allies have been killing their dairy cattle for food to an 
alarming extent. They had to because they needed the meat 
and were short of cattle feed. 

Our own dairy herds are less than they were as some have been 
slaughtered because of the high cost of feed and because farm 
hands are scarce to milk the cows. 

Milk is too valuable to waste. Give it to the children to drink, 
or if you give them skim milk, give plenty of butter to match it 
up. Drink SKIM MILK, use it in cooking. 

If it sours it is still good for cooking or for making cottage 
cheese. 

Don't let a drop of milk be wasted. 

Until the school age, milk may well be the main part of the 
diet. Give children milk, which is good for them, instead of 
coffee and tea, which destroys their appetites, makes them nervous 
and does not nourish them. If a child refuses plain milk, serve 
the milk combined with bread or cereal, or as milk soups, junkets, 
custards, cocoa, etc. It is almost impossible to give any other 
food in place of milk to a baby without danger of harm. 

Mr. Hoover has distinctly told us that children must have 
whole milk and butter; these together with fresh fruits and vege- 
tables contain that newly discovered element necessary to bodily 
growth known as vitamines, and right here let me state that 
the form of fat most commonly used, lard, is entirely lacking in 
vitamines. It produces bodily heat, but not life.

MILK AS A LIQUID 

Milk coagulates and becomes a solid in the stomach and should 
not be regarded as a drink but as a food. It should not be swal- 
lowed down rapidly, but sipped slowly, as the faster the milk is 
swallowed the larger the curds in the stomach and the harder to 
digest. Procure the very best. 

There are special methods of varying milk in the diet. Taste 
may be altered by heating or adding seasoning, spices, coffee, co- 
coa, mineral water. 

SOME KINDS OF MILK 

Whole Modified 

*Koumiss *Lactic acid 

*Buttermilk 

* These milks are good in digestive disturbances as the lactic 
acid bacteria (flavorable bacteria) destroy the putrif active bac- 
teria, which are harmful bacteria, which produce a disturbance 
called intestinal intoximia. This comes when the food remains in 
the intestines for a long time.

FOOD FOR YOUR CHILDREN 

Help your child to grow big and strong 

Uncle Sam is determined to save our babies. America has 
been startled by the physical defects of the young manhood re- 
vealed by the selective draft and, therefore, the government has 
started a campaign to free the rising generation from like dis- 
ability. It is a startling fact that according to records the sol- 
dier has seven times more chances for living than an American 
baby during the first year of its life. 

The most desirable foods for children are milk, eggs, beef- 
steak, mutton chop, roast lamb and chicken, baked, boiled or 
steamed vegetables, fruits, custards, junket, rice pudding, tapioca, 
gelatine, milk, water, cocoa. 



88 "Win the War" Cook Book 

The following should not be given to children: Dried or salted 
fish or meat, fried or sauted foods, raw vegetables, fresh and rich 
preserves, tea, coffee, or alcoholic drinks. 

Here's Good Food for a Real Youngster's Day 

A good breakfast to start him off: Milk, corn meal mush, apple 
sauce. It makes him fit for school and fit for play. 

MILK, and plenty of it, makes him grow a quart each day 
if you can. Put it on his cereal and in his soup. Make it into 
puddings or custards for him. Try the recipes on the next page 
and watch him smile. 

WHOLE milk is best, of course, but skim milk is good if there 
is a little butter in his meals. Cottage cheese is good, too. 

NO COFFEE OR TEA not even a taste. Leave them for the 
grown-ups. Milk, cocoa, not too strong, and fruit juices are the 
drinks for children, and plenty of water always. 

FRUIT they enjoy, and they need it, too; baked apples, apple 
sauce, thoroughly ripe bananas, prunes, oranges, etc. Give them 
vegetables, fresh or canned. Plenty of fruits and vegetables tend 
to prevent constipation. Use proper food and do not depend 
upon laxatives. 

OTHER FOODS a child needs: Whole wheat bread, not too 
fresh corn bread, well-cooked oatmeal, corn meal, rice. They help 
make strong boys and girls. Some fats, butter or margarine or 
meat fats on his bread or in gravies. An egg, perhaps, particu- 
larly if he doesn't get his full quart of milk, or he can have a 
little meat or fresh fish, but he does not need much. 

SWEETS are good for them the right kinds at the right time. 
Dates, raisins, stewed fruits, simple puddings, sugar cookies are 
better than candy. Give them at meal times. 

Betweeen meals let them have bread and butter, a cracker or 
fruit. They won't spoil the appetite, and candy will. 

PLAN MEALS LIKE THESE 

Here are two sets of the right kind for your youngster. Grown 
people will like them, too. If sometimes these seem too much 
work, bread and milk alone will make a good meal.

GOOD DISHES FOR CHILDREN 

These dishes are good for children and grown-ups, too. The re- 
cipes provide enough for a family of five. 



MILK-VEGETABLE SOUPS 

1 qt. milk, 2 cups thoroughly cooked vege- 
2 1 / tbsp. flour, tables, finely chopped, 

2 tbsp. butter or margarine mashed or put through a 

or other fat, sieve. Spinach, peas, beans, 

1 tsp. salt, potatoes, o r asparagus 

make good soups. 

Stir flour into melted fat and mix with the cold milk. Add the 
cooked vegetables and stir over the fire until thickened. If soup 
is too thick, add a little water or milk. 



RICE PUDDINGS 

1 qt. milk, y 2 tsp. salt, 

y$ cup rice, % tsp. ground nutmeg or cinna- 

y$ cup sugar, mon. 

% cup raisins or chopped 
dates, 

Wash the rice, mix all together and bake three hours in a very 
slow oven, stirring now and then at first. This may be made on 
top of the stove in a double boiler, or in a fireless cooker. Any 
coarse cereal may be used in place of rice. 

For more suggestions send to the U. S. Department of Agricul- 
ture for Farmers' Bulletin, "Food for Young Children." It tells 
more about feeding children and the reasons why right food is 
so important. It shows every mother how to give her children 
their chance in life.

Sauces 

To make good sauce is to be master of an art. It requires great 
care and attention to the smallest detail. A sauce is intended as 
an accompaniment to meat, fish, vegetables or dessert with which 
it is served, and should be in perfect harmony with it. It should 
never be so prominent in flavoring as to overbalance the flavor 
of the food. Certain sauces are associated with certain particular 
foods. Mint sauce with lamb, caper sauce with mutton, cran- 
berry sauce with turkey, and Hollandaise sauce with fish. Color 
adds to the attractiveness of a sauce and may be obtained by the 
addition of browned flour, caramel or fruit vegetable juices. 

GENERAL RULES FOR MIXING 

The thickening material must be separated by mixing with 
either fat, cold liquid or sugar before heat is applied. Use an 
equal amount of fat, double amount of liquid, double amount of 
sugar. Either the thickening material is cold, the liquid is hot, 
or the thickening material is hot and the liquid is cold. When 
the two parts of the sauce are mixed the sauce must be stirred 
until it thickens. Mix the salt with the flour. 

METHODS OF MIXING 

1. Hygienic Mix the thickening material with the cold liquid, 
stir into the heated liquid. Stir until the starch is cooked 3-5 min- 
utes over direct heat, 15-20 minutes in double boiler when milk 
is used. Add butter just before serving. 

2. American Mix thickening material with fat. Heat liquid 
and stir into it the thickening material. Cooked as the first 
method. 

3. French Heat the fat and stir into the thickening material. 
Add the cold liquid and cook 3-5 minutes over direct heat.

CREAMED DISHES 

Use equal portions of sauce and food to be creamed. Pour the 
sauces over the food and reheat, if necessary, in double boiler. 

SCALLOPED DISHES 

Use equal portions of sauce and food. Place alternate layers 
in a buttered dish. Cover with buttered crumbs. Reheat and 
brown in the oven. 

SOUFFLES 

Use equal portions of sauce and food with 3 eggs to each cup 
of sauce. Add the egg yolks to the sauce. Mix with the food. 
Fold in the egg whites and bake in buttered baking dish set in a 
pan of hot water. 

CROQUETTES 

Use equal portions of sauce and food. Mix and cool. Shape 
roll in crumbs slightly and add 1 tablespoonful of water or milk.

Eggs 

The Nature of the Nutrients in eggs is of almost as much in- 
terest and importance as their amount. The fact that when an 
egg is kept at a proper temperature for about three weeks, with- 
out the addition of anything from without, it produces a chick so 
well developed as to begin to walk and eat the same food as the 
adult, suggests at once that the egg must contain substances 
which are very efficient as sources both of the energy and the 
materials for growth and development. Children from one year 
to twelve years should not be deprived of the growth-determining 
substances, namely, vitamines in eggs and milk and butter; eggs 
contain the iron for the anemic. 

7-8 eggs 1 pound of meat of food value. 

See effect of heat on protein. 

Eggs are used as 

1. A meat substitute. 

2. A flavor. 

3. A leavening agent. 

4. A thickening agent. 

5. A clarifying agent. 

Cookery of Eggs. 

1. As leavening agents. 

The egg white of a beaten egg is full of air bubbles surrounded 
by the cell wall of protein. The air is a gas and expands with 
heat, thus making the substance (as in cake) light. 

2. Thickening agent. 

Heat coagulates the protein of the egg, thus forming a thickened 
mass (as in custards). Egg as a thickening agent is equal to 1 
tablespoonful cornstarch. 

3. Eggs act both as a leavening and flavor in quick breads. 
They can be omitted in these foods. The flavor may be omitted 
when eggs are high by using good brands of desiccated or pow- 
dered egg. 

4. As a clarifying agent. The albumen surrounds and coagu- 
lates around the coffee grain, making coffee grain heavy, and it 
settles to the bottom of the pot in which it is cooking. 



Meat Savers 95 

Note: Add a speck of salt to egg white; it toughens the pro- 
tein (albumin) just a little and makes it beat up better. 
Percentage Composition: 

White: Yolk: 

Water 76.2% Water 45.5% 

Protein ___. 12.3% Protein 15.7% 

Fat .2% Fat 33.3% 

Ash 6% Ash ___ 1.1% 

Mineral matter or ash: Sulphur, phosphorus, hydrogen, sulphide. 
The blueish-green coating around the yolk of a hard cooked egg is 
due to the mineral matter. Because of the mineral matter (bone 
and nerve building materials) eggs are good for growing children. 
They contain all the necessary elements in the right proportion 
for growth. 

Testing Eggs: 

A good fresh egg 

1. Has a rough shell. 

2. Is clear when held to a light. 

3. Sinks in water. 

4. Has no sound of movement when shaken. 

Methods of Preservation: 

1. Coating shell (paraffine). 

2. Putting eggs in lime water. 

3. Putting eggs in brine. 

4. Packing in bran or salt. 

5. Water glass solution. 

6. Cold storage. 30-40 F. 

Note: Eggs in water glass have been known to keep S 1 /^ 
months and taste just as good as fresh eggs. 

Methods of Cooking Eggs: 

Soft Eggs. 

1. Soft boiled: place egg in boiling water, cover and remove to 
place where water will keep hot, but not boil, 8-10 minutes. 
180 F., 87 C. 

2. Put in boiling water and boil vigorously from 2-3 minutes. 
(This toughens protein; is not a good method.) 

3. Put egg on in cold water and bring to a boil and egg is done. 



96 "Win the War" Cook Book 

Hard Eggs. 

1. Place egg in boiling water and remove to warm place for 40 
minutes (double boiler). 

2. Put eggs on in cold water and boil 30 minutes (not a good 
method). 

Note: Place egg after cooking in cold water, this allows the 
egg to shrink from shell and lining. 

Always wash eggs before breaking open or cooking. The shells 
are dirty and covered with bacteria. 

RECIPE FOR WATER GLASS 

V 2 part syrup of Calcium Silicate, 
10 parts water. 

BREAD OMELET 

3 eggs, % tsp. salt, 

y 2 cup milk, Vz tsp. pepper, 

% cup crumbs, 1 tbsp. oleo. 

Soak bread in milk, add beaten egg yolks and seasonings. Fold 
in beaten whites, cook and serve as plain omelet. 

Anna Jensen, 
St. Joseph, Mo. 

DRIED EGGS 

The method of using the dried egg is very simple. One slightly 
rounded tablespoonful is equivalent to one average-sized egg. This 
amount soaked for half an hour in 3 tablespoonfuls of water may 
be used in place of one egg. The egg will soften up more easily 
and be ready more quickly if stirred with fork at intervals. 

Substituting on this basis, one may use dried eggs in any re- 
cipe for cakes, cookies, muffins, custard, cooked salad dressings, 
etc., in which the whites and yolks are not separated. The follow- 
; ng ways of using dried eggs are suggested: 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

4 tbsp. dried eggs soaked in V can milk, 

% cup water, Salt, 

1 tbsp. butter sub., Pepper. 

Soak egg and beat well, add milk, salt and pepper and cook in 



Meat Savers 97 

the hot fat. This amount serves four people. The food value will 
be increased if the egg is soaked in one cup of skim milk. 

CUSTARDS 

Custards are combinations of milk and egg sweetened and 
flavored. Because of the protein present they should be cooked at 
a low temperature. This is accomplished by steaming or by bak- 
ing in^ molds set in pans of water. Custards are classified accord- 
ing to the method of preparation. There are two kinds, steamed 
and baked. 

To Combine a Steamed Custard scald the milk and pour it over 
the egg which has been beaten with the sugar and salt. Return 
the mixture to the double boiler and steam, stirring constantly 
until done. Add the flavoring just before removing from the fire. 

To Combine a Baked Custard, beat the egg with the sugar and 
salt. Add the cold milk and flavoring. Pour into molds and set 
in pans of water and bake until done. 

To Test a Steamed Custard, lift the spoon from the mixture. Jf 
the spoon is coated the custard is done. 

To Test a Baked Custard, insert a knife. If it comes out clean 
the custard is done. 

SOFT CUSTARD 



2 tbsp. dried eggs soaked in l 1 ^ cups milk, 
y 3 cup water for 20-30 min. % cup (4 tbsp.) honey or syrup, 

or 1-2 eggs, Flavoring. 

Add the syrup to the milk; beat in double boiler, and when hot, 
add the egg well soaked and beaten. Stir while cooking, and 
when custard has thickened, strain it so that any particles of dried 
egg not soluble will be removed. It will be found that the amount 
of insoluble matter is very little greater than in a custard made 
with fresh eggs. 

BAKED CUSTARD 

2 tbsp. (slightly rounded) of 1 cup milk, 

dried eggs soaked with % cup honey or syrup, 
^3 cup water, or 2 eggs, Flavoring. 

Combine as in the soft custard, strain, add flavoring and bake 
in an earthenware or granite baking dish in a slow oven until 
"set." Attractive when baked in ramekins and served individually.

Fats and Butter Substitutes 

Note: Dairy butter has food value vital to children, therefore 
use it on the table as usual. Use vegetable oils, as olive, cotton 
seed and corn oil. Save daily one-third of an ounce of animal fat. 
Waste no soap, it contains fat and the glycerine necessary for ex- 
plosives. You can make scrubbing soap at home, and in some 
localities you can sell your saved fats to the soap maker, who 
will thus save our needed glycerine.

HOW TO SAVE FATS 

Bab Bell, 

Extension Assistant Professor of Home Economics, 

Missouri University 

Fats are derived from two sources animal and vegetable. 
Animal, such as lard, butter, cream, beef fat, mutton fat and 
poultry fat. Vegetables, such as corn, cotton seed, olive, peanut, 
cocoanut, soy bean and sesame oils. 

Formerly more animal fats than vegetable fats have been used. 
Butter and lard were plentiful, accessible and in convenient form 
for household use. The average housekeeper depended upon them 
to the exclusion of all other forms of fat. Since there is a short- 
age in these particular fats, housekeepers must learn (1) to 
economize in the use of these by cutting down the amount of fat 
used; (2) to substitute wherever possible vegetable fats in place 
of animal fats. 

Since the conservation of fats in the home is a very important 
means of increasing the supply needed for exportation and home 
use, it becomes imperative that housewives should have a thor- 
ough knowledge concerning their composition, food value, digesti- 
bility, uses in cookery and general rules for conservation.

Fats and Ilxftcr Snhxtil/itc* 101 

Food Value: From this table the comparative food value of 
fats in general is seen. It should be remembered that fat yields 
two and one-fourth times as much energy for the body as equal 
weights of carbohydrates or protein. More and more is the im- 
portance of fat in the diet being recognized. Thirty per cent of 
the total number of calories needed in the diet should be furnished 
by fat. In the ordinary diet this is approximately four table- 
spoonfuls or one-fourth cup. 

The digestibility of fat is of more importance, especially when 
making substitutions. Generally speaking, animal fats and vege- 
table fats are equally digestible. Recent investigations have 
shown that there is very little difference in the digestibility of fats 
that have a melting point below body temperature. While the 
eating of large quantities of fat may retard the digestion of food, 
it is unlikely that any serious discomfort will be felt if it is pre- 
pared intelligently. Fats in general are completely digested, but 
require a longer time than most foods. 

Butter: Butter is the most widely used of all fats. It has been 
estimated that from 17 to 18 pounds per person are consumed 
yearly. There are many good and wholesome butter substitutes 
on the market which may be used both for cooking and table use. 
However, if these are used exclusively in the feeding of children, 
care should be used that the supply of whole milk should not be 
decreased. Whole milk and butter contain certain substances 
essential to growth which are entirely lacking or present in small 
quantities in butter substitutes. 

Oleomargarine: Oleomargarine is a name given to butter sub- 
stitutes made by churning fats other than butter with milk or 
cream. The principal fats usuallv used in the manufacture of 
oleomargarine are oleo oil made of beef fat and neutral lard made 
of leaf and cotton seed oil. Oleomargarine is a good, wholesome 
product, and there should be no objection to its use if it is proD- 
erly labeled. The best grades of oleomargarine contain nearly 
one-third as much of the growth-promoting substances (vita- 
mines) as butter does. 

Beef Fat: Beef fat is harder than lard and has a more pro- 
nounced flavor. For these reasons it is not used extensively in 
cooking. However, in certain dishes, finely chopped unrendered 
suet is used, and in some countries drippings from the cooked 



102 "Win the Wat-" Cook Book 

beef or rendered beef suet are used in place of butter on bread. 

Suet alone is of a hard consistency, but a good and satisfactory 
compound may be had by mixing cotton seed oil, corn oil, etc., with 
suet. Mix one part of oil with two or three parts of rendered 
suet. If V2 cup of skim milk be added to 1 cup of suet before 
rendering, the flavoring is improved. In summer, suet may be 
added to lard in small amounts in order to have a harder fat. 

Lard: Lard is one of the most commonly used animal fats. It 
is made from the fat of hogs and heretofore has been plentiful 
and comparatively cheap. Owing to the fact that most women 
are in the habit of using lard, it is somewhat difficult to accustom 
them to the use of vegetable oils and fats. 

Cotton Seed Oil: Cotton seed oil is obtained from the seeds of 
the cotton plant. One ton of seeds yields 50 gallons of oil. Prep- 
arations made of cotton seed oil are sold in the liquid form, Wes- 
son oil being a typical example. In addition, cotton seed oil is 
treated chemically to form hard fats, such as Snow Drift, White 
Cliff, Crisco, etc. All of these compounds have been found to be 
good and wholesome products. Combinations of cotton seed oil 
and animal fats are also on the market. The label on all pack- 
ages gives the ingredients. 

Corn Oil: This oil, which is made from corn, has only lately 
"ome into general use for food purposes. It is a wonderful sub- 
stitute for olive oil. Has a good flavor. May be used in all kinds 
of cooking. 

Peanut Oil: The oil made from peanuts is comparatively new 
in this country, since peanuts have been disposed of in other ways. 
Its use in cookery is very limited at the present time. 

Olive Oil: Olive oil is prepared from the olive fruit, and is one 
of the oldest oils now in use. The flavor depends upon the variety 
of olive, ripeness when picked, manner of handling, length of time 
of storage, etc. The extensive use of olive oil is due to its flavor. 
Olive oil has no more food value than the other oils. Its high 
price is due to its flavor alone. 

All fats have advanced in price, yet a great saving may be ac- 
complished by investigating the available fats on the market, 
their composition and their prices. As a general rule fats are 
less expensive when purchased in large quantities. A decided sav- 



Fats and Butter Substitutes 103 

ing may be made by purchasing both oils in gallon receptacles 
and harder fats in corresponding amounts. 

Many commercial fats are sold with the statement that one- 
third less may be used than lard. This statement is somewhat 
misleading. One fat should be substituted for another according 
to its composition. All 100 per cent fats given in the table on the 
composition of fats may be used interchangeably. Approximately 
seven-eighths as much of these fats will substitute for butter 
and oleomargarine. 

Savory Fats: Savory fats may be made when undesirable flav- 
ors are to be eliminated. Usually strong seasonings, such as 
thyme, sage, marjoram, summer savory, bay leaves or onions are 
added to unrendered fats, having pronounced odors or flavors like 
those of beef or mutton. 

These seasonings mask the strong original flavors. Render in 
a double boiler and strain carefully through a cloth so that all 
bits of herb are removed. Adding salt after rendering improves 
the flavor. 

Savory fats may also be prepared from rendered fats by adding 
the seasonings, heating the mixture and straining. 

Fats with strong flavors, such as suet and mutton fat, may be 
improved by heating with water, milk, or charcoal. If charcoal is 
used, all pieces may be removed by straining through a heavy 
cloth. 

Care of Fats: All fats which are to be stored for some time 
should be protected from heat, light and air, in order to prevent 
them from becoming rancid. Keep in tightly covered receptacles 
and in a cool, dark place. 

In summer time scraps of fat which are saved should be ren- 
dered promptly to prevent them from becoming rancid. It is also 
important in rendering or clarifying fats that all moisture be 
driven off, since molds are very apt to grow if fats contain mois- 
ture. 

Keep butter, oleomargarine and other butter substitutes in a 
cool place away from food having strong odors, since odors are 
readily absorbed by these fats. Store the oils in closed cans or 
bottles wrapped in paper in a cool place the refrigerator is pref- 
erable. 



104 "Win the War" Cook Book 

How to Render Fats: Chop in small pieces or put through a 
meat chopper, heat in a double boiler until all the fat has melted. 
The use of a double boiler prevents too high a temperature. If 
fat is over-heated it will become rancid. Strain through a cloth, 
heat again to sterilize and drive off moisture. 

How to Clarify Fats: Method I: Melt the fat with an equal 
proportion of water in a double boiler. Strain through a cloth. 
When cold remove the layer of fat from the water. 

Method II: Follow directions given in I, using sour milk. Flav- 
ors and odors are modified. 

Method III: Follow directions in I, adding several pieces of 
clean hardwood charcoal. If beef fat is being clarified, the yellow 
color is removed and a white odorless fat is secured. 

In many homes the practice of making soap from drippings, 
trimmings, etc., has long been the custom. At the present time 
when fats are so scarce every effort should be made to utilize 
every particle for good. If the scrap jar is watched carefully, no 
fats will be available for soap making. 

Many people are eating more fat than their bodies require. 
This extravagance means that our soldiers and the working people, 
who need generous amounts of fat, will be denied this necessity. 
If everyone realizes the seriousness of the situation and will cut 
down on his daily allowance of butter, cream, oil and cooking fat, 
a large amount of fat will be saved. 

SUGGESTIONS FOR FAT CONSERVATION 

1. Eat just enough fat to supply body needs. Thirty per cent 
of the total number of calories in the ration is sufficient, or four 
level tablespoons. 

2. Leave no fat on the plate. This means fat from meat as well 
as butter. 

3. Use pure butter on the table, especially for children, but 
sparingly for cooking. 

4. Do not use it in cooking. 

5. Peanut butter, jellies, or nut and fig paste are excellent sub- 
stitutes. 

6. Use vegetable fats (made solid by treating commercially 
with hydrogen). 

7. Use vegetable oils for frying and salad dressings. 



Fats </i/<l Ittifler Substitutes 105 

8. Make gravies to conserve the flavor of the extractives and 
the food value fats from meats. 

9. Keep all rinds of bacon and salt pork. Use as seasonings 
when cooking cabbage, greens, vegetables, soups, etc. 

10. Save all trimmings from beef, pork, mutton and fowl. Ren- 
der and use in cooking. 

11. Keep a small jar for bits of fats, drippings or gristles. 
When a sufficient amount has been collected, render the contents. 

WAR BUTTER 

How to make 2 a /4 pounds of butter out of 1 pound, 
of Vz pound. 

1 Ib. butter, 1 tbsp. gelatine. 

1 pt. rich milk, 

Method No. 1. Cream butter. Put small amount cold milk with 
gelatine. Heat rest, pour over soaked gelatine. Add to butter, 
heat until it begins to thicken, place on platter by spoonful to 
thicken. 1 pound makes 2*4 pounds. 

V 2 Ib. butter, V 2 Ib. whole milk. 

1 tsp. salt, 

Method No. 2. Churn 2 minutes. Can be done with mason jar 
and spoon beater, ice cream freezer, Daisy churn. 

PASTRY 

Use little pastry when you do make pies, use one crust instead 
of two. 

Try the New England deep apple pie, with only one top crust. 

Use the vegetable fats instead of animal fats in making pastry. 

If vegetable oils are used the quantity of fat may be reduced 
by one-third; that is 2% tablespoonfuls of oil to 1 cup of flour is 
sufficient. The oil itself helps to moisten the flour so that very 
little water is necessary. The dough should be made as dry as 
possible to make a tender pastry. 

U. S. Food Administration. 

CONSERVATION OF PIE CRUST 
CORN MEAL CRUST 

Grease a pie plate well. Cover with raw corn meal, giving the 
plate a rotating motion so that an even layer of the meal will 



106 "Win the Wai" Cook Book 

stick to the plate about 1/16 of an inch in thickness. Fill the 
plate with pumpkin pie mixture. Bake in hot oven. 

OATMEAL CRUST 

2 cups finely ground oatmeal, 1 tsp. salt. 

I cup boiling water, 

Scald the oatmeal with the water. Add fat and mix thoroughly. 
Roll very thin and line small pie or tart tins with the mixture. 
Bake in hot oven. Fill with apricot marmalade or other thick mix- 
ture. If desired spread a meringue on top and brown in the 
oven. 

MEATLESS MINCEMEAT 

Another culinary triumph in the art of food conservation has 
been brought to the attention of housewives of the country by the 
National Emergency Garden Commission as a worthy companion 
of pumpkinless pumpkin pies and gingerless ginger bread. The 
new mincemeat, officially described as "camouflage," was tried on 
500 troops on a transport, who pronounced it perfect and called 
for more. Half a package of raisins, half a pound of prunes 
stewed with lemon juice and peeled; % cup of sweet cider, 4 table- 
spoonfuls or brown sugar. Chop raisins and prunes together and 
the result is said to be a meatless mincemeat pie in accord with 
the Food Administration's meatless Tuesday. 

MOCK MINCEMEAT (No Meat)

2 packages raisins, 
2 tbsp. mixed spices (allspice, cloves, cinnamon and nutmeg), 

Grind tomatoes, add salt, drawn over night through bag. Mix 
all ingredients and cook slowly for 2% hours. 

Note: Best results are obtained by using- fireless cooker, and 
cooking 6 or 7 hours. Mrs. R. J. Winters.

2. Break 4 eggs in bowl or pan; add pinch salt; beat until well 
mixed. 

3. Pour the molasses over the eggs, stirring briskly. 

4. Have pie pans lined with crust. Pour in and bake. This 
makes two pies. If you wish to make but one pie, equally divide 
the ingredients. 



PREPARATION AND PROPERTIES OF SOAP AND 
EQUATIONS SHOWING THE REACTIONS 

Natural fats and oils are essentially mixtures of stearin, pal- 
mi tin and olein. Beef and mutton fat are chiefly stearin, lard is 
mainly palmitin and olein, and while oils, such as olive, are chiefly 
olein, stearin and palmitin are solids at the ordinary temperature, 
but olein is a liquid. 

Tallow is chiefly stearin, but human fat and palm oil are largely 
palmitin. The soft and liquid fats and oils contain considerable 
olein as a rule. The proportion of the olein determines the con- 
sistency of the fats and oils. Thus olive oil contains 72 per cent 
of olein (and a similar fat) and about 28 per cent of stearin and 
palmitin. 

Butter consists of fats corresponding to the following acids: 
palmitic, stearic, oleic, butyric, capric and caproic. The last three, 
together with traces of other substances, give butter its pleasant 
flavor. Oleomargarine and other substitutes for butter resemble 
real butter very closely in composition. 

C3H3(OH)3. 

Glycerine is a thick, sweet liquid. It is used to make nitro- 
glycerine. It is also used as a solvent, a lubricator, a preservation 
for certain foods as a sweetening substance in certain preserves 
and candy. 

Glycerine is a by-product in the manufacture of soap. Glycer- 
ine is an alcohol and for this reason is often called glycerol when 
treated with a mixture of concentrated nitric and sulphuric acids 
it forms nitroglycerine (C 3 H 5 (ONO,) 3 ). This is a heavy oily liquid, 
a well-known explosive and an ingredient of other explosives. 

When mixed with infusional earth, fire and sand and even saw- 
dust it is known as dynamite.

HARD SOAP 

1. Stearin (beef or mutton fat)-|-Water glycerine-|-stearic acid. 
Stearic acid-{-sodium chloride=sodium stearate, or (hard soap) 

-(-Hydrochloric acid. 

2. Stearic acid-|-sodium hydroxide hard soap and water. 

SOFT SOAP 

Stearin (beef or mutton fat) potassium hydroxide soap and 
glycerine. 

HOME METHOD OF MAKING SOAP 

Empty the contents of a can of lye into a stone jar, pour over it 
2% pints of cold water and stir until lye dissolves. Set aside 
until the temperature is not over 80 F. or 262/3 C. Melt 5% 
pounds of clean greasy tallow, or lard, and set aside until the tem- 
perature is 120 F. or 49 C., slowly pour dissolved lye into the 
grease, stir until lye and grease are thoroughly combined and mix- 
ture drops from stirrer like honey. Stir slowly but not too long, 
or you may separate the lye; from 5 to 15 minutes is enough, ac- 
cording to grease and weather. Pour into a mold, set away for a 
day or two, empty out and cut up as desired. 

SALADS 
Vegetable Oils 

Salads are divided into two groups, dinner salads and the more 
substantial salads served at supper and luncheon in the place of 
meats. 

Fruit salads are much out of place in the dinner menu unless 
they figure as the last course, when they are served with crackers, 
cheese and coffee. This is an unusual custom that is rapidly 
growing in popularity. Fruit salads are naturally sweet, and 
when followed by a dessert, the palate is not apt to become clogged 
with sweet. As a general rule sweets and savories do not mix, 
although occasionally they may be blended as currant or orange 
salad with game. These exceptions must, however, be introduced 
with sparing hands, as they often strike a discordant note. 

The heavy salad, swathed with mayonnaise or boiled dressing, 
is entirely out of place at dinner, because it overloads the menu 
with fat. Only those salads of green vegetables should be selected, 
like lettuce, beets and cabbage, tomatoes and cress, asparagus, etc., 
French dressing with variations alone being suitable. 



Fats and Butter Substitutes 109 

Heavy salads fit into light luncheon better than into any other 
meals, and may often form the main dish, while a fruit salad is 
always acceptable in place of dessert. 

Salads are of exceeding importance in metabolism. 

The green vegetables and fruits contain the so-called inorganic 
elements as mineral salts, which must exist in the body and take 
part in functions in at least three different ways: (1) as the con- 
stituents which give rigidity and comparative permanence to the 
skeleton; (2) as essential elements of the protoplasm of the 
active tissues; (3) as salts held in solution in the fluids of the body, 
giving these fluids their characteristic influence upon the elasticity 
and irritability of muscle and nerve supplying the material for 
the acidity or alkalinity of the digestive juices and other secre- 
tions and yet maintaining the neutrality of slight alkalesence of 
the internal fluids as well as their osmotic pressure and solvent 
power. 

Left over greens, vegetables, string beans, peas, carrots, turnips, 
cauliflower, cooked spinach, beets and leeks may take their place 
in the dinner salad. Use them mixed, alone, or as a garnish for 
lettuce. 

The oil used in the salad dressings has much food value. It is 
a heat and energy producing substance. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

2 eggs (yolks), 1 tsp. salt, 

2 cups Mazola oil, 1 tsp. mustard, 

2 tbsp. vinegar, Dash cayenne. 
Juice of 1 lemon, 

Set the mixing bowl in a pan of chopped ice and have ingredi- 
ents very cold. 

Mix the seasonings and add to the beaten yolks of the eggs. 
Beat with a small wooden spoon or silver fork. At first add the 
oil drop by drop, beating vigorously. When too thick to beat, add 
1 teaspoonful vinegar. Continue to add the oil slowly, alternating 
with the vinegar and the lemon juice until at least ^ cup of oil 
has been added. Onion juice may be added if desired. 

If the oil is added too rapidly the dressing separates and has a 
curdled appearance. This should never happen if the oil is added 
very slowly at first; but in case it does, put the yolk of another 
egg into a clean bowl and beat in the curdled dressing slowly. 



110 i "Win the WW Cook Book 

After a half cup of oil has been added the dressing may be beaten 
with a Dover egg beater and the oil added more rapidly. 

NORWEGIAN MAYONNAISE 

Add a tablespoonful of anchovy paste to a half pint of mayon- 
naise dressing, stir in a tablespoonful of tomato catsup, ten drops 
of Worcestershire sauce and 2 drops of Tabasco. Use with broiled 
or fried fish. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

l /z tsp. salt, 1 tbsp. vinegar (malt or 

% tsp. white pepper, Tarragon preferred), 

Dash paprika, 3 tbsp. Mazola or other veg. oil. 

Mix the seasonings and stir into the oil. Add the vinegar and 
beat vigorously till the mixture thickens slightly. 

Green salads should be dressed at the time of serving. The 
flavor is improved if the bowl in which the salad is arranged is 
rubbed with a clove of garlic or slice of onion. 

A 1 SALAD DRESSING 

Mix % teaspoonful of freshly ground pepper, ^ teaspoonful salt 
and one teaspoonful of prepared mustard. Then stir in 4 teaspoon- 
fuls of Mazola, and when blended, add 1 tablespoonful of claret. 

Serve it on any plain salad of lettuce, or a mixture of lettuce, 
chives and cucumbers. The lettuce should be washed several times, 
drained and wrapped in a napkin and laid on the ice until chilled 
and crisp. Do not slice the cucumbers nor chop the chives until 
just before serving. 

Put the salad into a bowl in any preferred way, the lettuce ar- 
ranged like an open head with a sprinkling of chives and a border 
of sliced cucumbers overlapping, or have the cucumbers diced and 
heaping in the center and the lettuce for a border. Add the dress- 
ing when serving, as the vegetables wilt quickly after the dressing 
is blended with them. 

HOLLANDAISE SAUCE 

Beat the yolks of 4 eggs and beat in gradually % cup Mazola or 
other vegetable oil. Add a /4 teaspoonful salt, dash of paprika and 
% cup boiling water. Cook over hot water, stirring constantly until 
thick, adding gradually the juice of Vz lemon. Chill before using. 
Serve with fish, or a fish salad.

Sugar Substitutes 

Americans eat more sugar than other folks do; more than is 
really good for them. We have been using 4 ounces a piece daily, 
other people half as much, and now our allies are down to I ounce 
a day or less. 

One ounce a day (2 tablespoonfuls or 6 teaspoonfuls), that is 
all it takes to make a stock of 1,185,000 tons this year for our 
army and our allies. Saving that ounce a day is part of your war 
service. 

U. S. Food Administration. 
Your principal way of substituting for sugar is the diet. 

1. All the ripe fruits contain sugar. The amount varies from 
about 3 ounces or 6 tablespoonfuls per pound in fresh figs and 
plums to about Vz ounce per pound in watermelon. 

2. Dried fruits: If the water is driven off from fruits as in the 
drying process, the sugar becomes more condensed than it is in 
fresh fruits. 

3. Syrup may replace sugar in most recipes; give the children 
syrup, honey, molasses, preserves. It is better for them than 
candy. 

Sorghum molasses l 1 /^ cups is equiv. 1 cup sugar. 

Corn molasses 1^ cups is equiv. 1 cup sugar. 

Honey 1^5 cups is equiv. 1 cup sugar. 

Maple syrup iy 2 cups is equiv. 1 cup sugar. 

4. Add more salt to cereals in cooking them. This saves the 
amount of sweetening necessary at time of serving. 

Note: 1. When using honey in place of molasses in any re- 
cipe, use less soda, according to the acid in the honey. When in 
doubt use less. 2. Do not substitute vegetable syrups or 
preserves in the regular diet of the child. These are lacking in 
vitamines or "growth determiners," which are absolutely vital to 
the physical development of the child. Butter, eggs and fresh 
fruits are rich in vitamines and are essential. 3. To replace 1 
cup sugar by P/4 cups molasses, subtract */4 cup from the liquid 
called for in the recipe. See table of syrups composition and 
apply to other syrups. 

To test the stages of syrups in candy cooking. 

These tests are made by dropping a small portion of the syrup 



118 "Win the War" Cook Book 

into cold water. Each stage or test corresponds to a definite tem- 
perature as indicated by the thermometer. 

Soft Ball When mixture will make up into soft ball, 236 F. or 
113 C. 

Hard Ball When mixture forms a firm, or rather hard, ball, 
230 F. or 123 C. 

Soft Crack When mixture becomes crisp and too hard to form 
a ball, 260 F. or 127 C. 

Hard Crack When mixture will crack or break when crushed 
between fingers, 290 F. or 143 C. 

Caramel A fifth stage is known as the caramel stage. This 
may be reached by boiling the syrup beyond the hard crack stage 
or by melting dry sugar over direct heat. The test for this 
stage is a golden color, 348 F. or 176 C. 



EAT LESS SUGAR 
Mary E. Robinson 
Missouri University 

The average American eats approximately 90 pounds of sugar 
a year. This includes not only the amount eaten at the regular 
meals, but also that taken between meals in the forms of candy, 
cakes, ice creams and soft drinks. 

Sugar is used as a source of energy for the body. When eaten 
in excess, it tends to ferment and cause digestive disturbances. 
The average amount of sugar which may be eaten by an adult per 
day is four tablespoonfuls or four tablespoonfuls of honey, 3% 
tablespoonfuls of syrup or four tablespoonfuls of molasses. How- 
ever, soldiers on long marches, athletes or school children may use 
more sugar in the diet than less active persons of the same size 
and weight. In the case of children there is danger that in eating 
too much sugar, especially in the form of candy, the appetite will 
be dulled for more wholesome foods and a lack of mineral matter 
in the diet will result. 

The following table gives the composition of the sugars and 
syrups in common use:

SUGGESTIVE METHODS FOR THE CONSERVATION OF 

SUGAR 

1. No adult should eat more than 4 tablespoonfuls of sugar per 
day. A part of this amount may be in the form of honey, syrup or 
any other sweet. 

2. Reduce to a minimum the amount of sugar used in beverages. 
Many beverages are served sweeter than they need to be, and 
sugar is often left in the cup or glass in which they are served. 

3. If cereals are prepared carefully, salted and thoroughly 
cooked, they will be palatable without the addition of sugar. If the 
sweet taste is desired, sweeten the cereals with fruit, rather than 
sugar. (Ex. oatmeal and raisins or dates.) 

4. Use recipes calling for less sugar, especially for cakes and 
other desserts; substitutes, corn syrup, sorghum, honey, apple 
syrup, and other fruit syrups for the sugar. 

5. Use more fresh, dried and canned fruits and less sugar will 
be desired. 

6. Omit rich, heavy desserts requiring sugar, such as puddings 
with rich sauces, iced cakes, sugar pies, etc. 

7. When sugar is craved, eat fruits instead of candy, ice cream 
and soft drinks. Fruits will be better for the body and the sub- 
stitution will render a patriotic service. 

8. Give children fruit, fruit juice, fruit breads and fruit cookies 
instead of candy and rich cake. 

SUGARLESS CANDIES 

It is almost impossible for American people to break them- 
selves of the candy-eating habit. Therefore, at this time, some 
form of confection should be substituted which requires little or 
no sugar. 

The following sugarless recipes are suggested: 

STUFFED DATES 

Remove seed by splitting the fruit lengthwise. Fill the center 
with chopped nut meats or cherries and wrap in oiled paper. 

FRUIT SQUARES 

Run equal parts of figs, raisins and dates through the food 



Suyar Substil/ilf* 121 

chopper. Add ^ the amount of cocoanut or nuts. Moisten with 
orange juice. Shape into balls or squares. 

These may be dipped into melted chocolate or not, as desired. 
Dried peaches, apricots or prunes may be substituted for fruits 
given above. 

DRIED PINEAPPLE 

Peel fruit and slice crosswise in very thin slices. Place in oven, 
the door of which is left open, or in a drying rack over the stove. 
Dry as for apples. 

SYRUP OR MOLASSES TAFFY 

3 cups syrup or sorghum, 1 tsp. vinegar. 

1 tbsp. butter, 

Cook syrup until it forms a hard ball when dropped in cold 
water. Add one tablespoonful strong vinegar for flavoring. Pour 
on cold buttered or oiled platter. Allow to cool until it can easily 
be handled and pull until light. 

CARAMELS 

2 cups sorghum or Karo Vz cup cream or condensed 

syrup, milk, 

l 1 /^ squares chocolate, 2 tbsp. vinegar. 

Cook until it forms a firm ball in cold water. Pour on buttered 
pan, and when cut in squares wrap in wax paper. 

FRUIT PASTE 

Put through the meat chopper enough cherry, peach or quince 
preserves to make Vz pint with the juice. Heat fruit and add 2 
tablespoonfuls of gelatine previously softened in a very little cold 
water. Stir well and continue stirring until it begins to cool and 
thicken, then pour into oiled dish to make a layer 1 inch thick. 
Let dry slowly, sprinkle with sugar and place in box with waxed 
paper between layers. A mixture of dried apricots and soaked over 
night in enough water to cover may be used for this paste. Pour 
off water, bring it to a boil, pour over apricots, and let stand until 
cool. Put apricots and dates through meat chopper and proceed 
with the proportions above. 



122 "Win the War" Cook Book 

PASTE BONBONS 

Soak 1 ounce of gelatine in % cup of water, add to hot syrup; 
makes 2 cups hot corn syrup. Take from fire, add 2 teaspoonfuls 
each of lemon and orange juice and 1 of rum or brandy, and if 
for mint bonbons, add also 2 teaspoonfuls of creme de menthe and 
2 drops of spearmint and color green; if for fruit, color pink and 
add Vs cup each minced candied fruits, pecans or almonds. Turn 
into a wet pan % of an inch thick, put on ice and in 12 hours turn 
out on board dusted with powdered sugar. Cut in squares and 
roll in sugar. 

BITTER SWEETS 

An attractive variety of candies may be made by dipping sweet 
fruits in bitter chocolate. Use for this purpose dates, citron, 
candied orange peel or crystallized fruit. Melt unsweetened choco- 
late in double boiler. Keep the chocolate just warm enough to 
prevent solidifying. With a fork drop pieces of fruit in chocolate. 
See that each piece is completely coated, then remove to waxed 
paper to harden. 

OLD-FASHIONED MOLASSES CANDY 

2 cups molasses, % tsp. baking powder, 

1 tbsp. vinegar, 1 tsp. vanilla or ginger extract. 

2 tbsp. (1 ounce) butter sub., 

Put molasses, vinegar and butter into a sauce pan, bring to a 
boiling point and boil, stirring all the time until the mixture is 
brittle when dropped into cold water. Stir in baking powder and 
extract and pour into buttered tin. When nearly cold, pull until 
glossy. Cut into small pieces and lay on a buttered plate or wrap 
in waxed paper. Sufficient for 1 pound of candy. 

PEANUT BRITTLE 

2 cups New Orleans molasses, 1 cup roasted peanuts. 

Cook molasses until it cracks when dropped in cold water, car- 
amel stage; have ready the peanuts rolled fine, stir in, pour on 
oiled marble slab, roll with flat blade of knife as it cools; this 
should harden in the thin sheets. 



Sugar Substitutes 123 

POPCORN CANDY 

1 cup syrup, 1 tbsp. vinegar. 

2 qts. of popped corn, 

Boil together the syrup and vinegar until it hardens when 
dropped in cold water. Pour over freshly popped corn and mold 
into balls or fancy shapes for the Christmas tree. Little pop- 
corn men will please the children. Mark in the features and out- 
lines with melted chocolate. 

Either honey, maple syrup, molasses, white cane syrup or corn 
syrup may be used. 

U. S. Food Administration. 

PLAIN HONEY TAFFY 

1 cup sugar, ^ cup water, 

1 cup honey, 1 tsp. vanilla. 

Boil the honey and sugar together until the mixture makes a 
hard ball in cold water (270 F.). Add vanilla or other flavor if 
desired. Put in a buttered dish to cool and pull until white. If 
the pan the honey is cooked in is buttered around the top the 
honey will not boil over on the stove. It is possible to vary these 
proportions widely and always get a delicious taffy. 

HONEY CANDY WITH PEANUTS 

2 cups honey, 1 cup boiling water, 

1 cup butter, Pinch salt. 

Boil to a hard ball, and pour over layer of rolled peanuts which 
have been scattered evenly over the bottom of a buttered pan. 
When nearly cold, mark off in long strips and roll up tight, then 
slice across with a sharp knife before it gets quite cold. This re- 
cipe may be varied by adding 1 or 2 cups of sugar when it has 
cooled slightly; stir in 1 or 2 teaspoonfuls peanut butter to suit 
taste, keep stirring until creamy, pour into buttered pan, mark in 
squares. 

HONEY BUTTER SCOTCH 

3 h. tsp. butter, 2 cups honey, 

i/4 tsp. soda, 2 tsp. lemon extract, 

2 tbsp. vinegar, 2 cups brown sugar. 

Boil the honey, butter and vinegar until it hardens when dropped 



124 "Win the War" Cook Book 

into water (270 F.), stir in the soda and extract; pour in buttered 
tins to cool. 

HONEY CHOCOLATE CARAMELS 

Vz lb. cocoa, % lb. pecan nuts, 

2 cups honey, Ibs. sweet almonds. 

1 tsp. vanilla, 

Cut the nuts fine and boil them with other ingredients until 
thick (260 F.), cool and roll out, cut in squares and dry in oven. 

CHOCOLATE HONEY TAFFY 

1 piece chocolate, inch square, l /^ cup sugar, 
1 cup honey, 1 tsp. vanilla. 

Boil until it makes a hard ball in cold water (270 F.). Add 
vanilla and put in a buttered dish to cool. Pull until light. 

CAKES 

Bake only those cakes in which syrup may be substituted for 
sugar. Vegetable fat or oil for butter. A part other cereal flours 
for wheat flour. 

Do not use frostings unless you can make them without sugar. 

The following table was worked out by Mary E. Robinson in 
Missouri University. 

This standard recipe may be varied by adding 3 squares of 
chocolate to make a devil's food cake, or the flavor may be changed 
by adding spices, nuts, fruit, etc. 

Mary E. Robinson, 
University of Missouri. 

Note: Remember that any cake or other food containing molas- 
ses is very apt to burn rapidly. A moderate oven is one that will 
brown a paper a cinnamon brown in 5 minutes.

Sterilization and Home Canning 

In the preservation of foods by heat, it is necessary that a tem- 
perature be selected such that all organism capable of producing 
undesirable changes shall be destroyed, and yet no undesirable 
changes take place in the food itself. This means practically that 
the temperature selected should be just as low as is consistent 
with certain sterilizations. 

Many articles of food are quite efficiently sterilized by being 
brought to the boiling temperature. Such are those that contain 
considerable quantities of acid, as do the fruits. In this case, the 
antiseptic and disinfectant action of the acid is so increased by 
the temperature of boiling water that it quite certainly sterilizes 
the food material. Foods containing a large proportion of sugars 
are also easily sterilized by boiling, in as much as the boiling tem- 
perature of a saccharine solution is much higher than 100 C. 
A concentrated solution of sugar, by its high osmotic pressure, 
also acts as a preservative. Vegetables such as corn and peas 
are much more difficult to preserve, in as much as they contain 
neither acid nor sugar in considerable quantities and are ordinarily 
infected with certain of the anaerobic spore-producing bacteria, 
which are capable of withstanding high temperatures. Care must 
be used not to heat such foods to too high a temperature, or the 
flavor and appearance will be materially impaired. If the tem- 
perature is not high enough, however, the spores will not be killed 
and butyric acid bacteria and certain gas formers will begin to 
develop. The entire season's output of canneries has been de- 
stroyed in this way. This difficulty may be obviated in several 
ways. 

Temperatures considerably higher than those of boiling water 
may be used. The cans are filled with the vegetables, sealed, and 
placed in a steam cooker much resembling in action the autoclave 
used in the laboratory. Steam is admitted under pressure and the 
desired temperature can be reached by controlling the steam pres- 
sure. Experimentation is sometimes necessary to determine the 
temperature in particular instances which will certainly destroy 
all of the bacteria present, and at the same time not injure the 
material being canned.

Intermittent sterilization may be resorted to. This is the most 
common method used in the household in canning certain vege- 
tables. The cans containing the material to be preserved are 
placed in water, the water brought to a boil and kept at a boiling 
temperature for a period of an hour or more. They are then al- 
lowed to cool, and the process repeated on three or more suc- 
cessive days. This is the principle of intermittent sterilization 
such as is used in the laboratory for sugar media easily destroyed 
by heat. The spores present begin to germinate in the first 
twenty-four hours. The second heating will kill all the vege- 
tative forms which have developed. Repeating the heating in this 
manner several times will certainly destroy all the bacteria which 
may be present. 

Some canners have made a practice of adding small quantities 
of chemicals as preservatives. This enables them to sterilize at a 
lower temperature and insure them from loss from decomposition. 
In canning factories, temperatures from 110 to 120 C. for twenty 
to thirty minutes are used for sterilization in small packages and 
longer periods for larger packages. The heat used in the preserva- 
tion of food by sterilization produces few changes other than 
those which would be accomplished by ordinary cooking. Proteins 
are generally coagulated and sugar is usually inverted to some 
extent, i. e., changed to simpler sugars. 

MICRO-ORGANISMS IN FOODS PRESERVED BY HEAT 

Micro-organisms may gain entrance to foods by improper seal- 
ing or they may persist th'rough a process of attempted steriliza- 
tion. 

Certain types of food materials, particularly the fruits, are 
most apt to be attacked by molds, such as Penicillium and Asper- 
gillus. These molds do not develop unless there is oxygen present. 
They fail to develop in hermetically sealed jars. They bring about 
changes which render the material undesirable as food, although 
there is no evidence that they produce poisonous substances in 
appreciable quantities. Usually the mold is confined to the sur- 
face, but the decomposition products of its growth frequently 
penetrate the flavor of the whole mass. 

Vegetables and meats are commonly destroyed by bacteria. The 
most abundant types are those which have withstood heating be- 



Sterilization and Home Canning 143 

cause of the resistant character of the spores formed. The or- 
ganisms belonging to the butyric acid group of bacteria are rela- 
tively abundant in the soil and are present on the surfaces of 
most vegetables. They bring about decomposition with the evolu- 
tion of considerable amounts of gas. This gas may accumulate 
in quantities sufficient to bulge and even to break the tin in which 
it is sealed. The development of such organisms renders the food 
wholly unfit for use. Some bacteria have been described which 
bring about decomposition in vegetables and meats without the 
evolution of gas. They give evidence of their presence by the de- 
velopment of peculiar odors and flavors. In many cases these 
gain entrance to the food after it has been sealed, and are due to 
defective sealing. 

STEPS IN PREPARATION 

1. Preparation and cleaning of containers. 

2. Preparation of products to be canned, washing, paring, cut- 
ting, etc. 

3. Clean hands, clean utensils, clean, sound, fresh products and 
pure, clean, soft water. 

4. If possible, the fruits and vegetables should be picked the day 
of canning. 

5. The containers washed should be placed in a vessel of cold 
water over a fire to heat. They will then be hot and ready for 
use when the products have been prepared for packing. 

I. (a) Scalding or blanching is done by placing the products to 
be canned in cheese cloth bag, or dipping basket into 
boiling water, and allowed to remain there from 1 to 15 
minutes, depending on the kind of product. 

(b) In the case of green vegetables, however, the scalding 
is accomplished most satisfactorily in steam, as volatile 
oils and other substances remain in the food under this 
treatment. 

II. As soon as the product is removed from the boiling water 

or steam, it should be dipped into cold, clean water, and 
immediately removed and drained for a few moments. 
The temperature of the water used for cold dipping 
should be as low as possible. 



144 "Win the War" Cook Book 

III. Packing: The product should be packed carefully into 

hot jars as soon as removed. In this case fruits; boiling 
hot syrup or hot water is then added. In the case of 
vegetables, hot water is usually used and salt for sea- 
soning. The scalded rubbers and tops of jars are put 
into place, the tops of cans sealed and the containers 
placed in a hot water bath preserve cooker or other 
similar device for processing. 

. IV. Processing is the final application of heat to sterilize the 

product and is continued for a period determined by the 
character of the product and the kind of apparatus used. 
The containers should be placed in the processing ves- 
sel as soon as they are filled. 

V. Sealing: Immediately after the termination of the proc- 

essing period, while the products are still hot, glass and 
similar containers must be sealed. 

Jars should then be placed in a tray upside down to cool 
and closely examined for leaks. If leakage occurs the 
covers should be tightened until they are completely 
closed. 

A FEW SUGGESTIONS 

Tin cans may be cooled by plunging them in cold water. Store 
them in a cool, dry place not exposed to freezing temperature. 

Most products packed in glass jars will blanch or darken if ex- 
posed to light; it is well, therefore, to wrap the jars in paper. 
From time to time, especially during very hot weather, both glass 
jars and tin cans should be examined to make certain that there 
are no leaks, swelling or other signs of fermentation.

Notes: 1. Do not begin to count time when the jars are placed 
in the canner, but wait until the water begins to "boil hard". 

2. Count time only while water is "boiling hard". If it stops 
for only a few minutes, make up for it with longer boiling. 

3. Use only NEW RUBBERS. If they are so poor that they 
are destroyed in the boiling or if they slip from under the lid or 
are cut by the lid when it is screwed down, remove the rubber, 
replace it with a new one which has been placed in BOILING water 
for 10 minutes. Then place the jar back in the canner and sterilize 
30 minutes longer. 

4. Fit lids carefully before placing the product in the can. 

5. DO NOT be alarmed if the water does not cover the product 
in the can. It will keep just as well. Some water will escape in 
the form of steam if the lid is not fairly tight and some will be 
absorbed by the product, especially if it is corn or mature peas 
and beans. 

RELISHES 

GREEN TOMATO CATSUP 

Boil the tomatoes until soft, then put through a colander. To 1 % 
gallons of tomatoes, add 1 pound of sugar, 1 pint of vinegar, 1 
tablespoonful of whole black pepper, a double handful of salt, a 
small onion chopped and 1 teaspoonful of ground cloves. Boil all 
together until the watery particles disappear and it becomes 
somewhat like marmalade, then bottle and seal. 

UNCOOKED TOMATO RELISH 

Cut one-half peck of peeled tomatoes, 1 cup each of celery, onion 
and green peppers, add 1 cup of salt and chop all together. Drain 
in a bag over night, and then add half cup of white mustard seed, 
2 tablespoonfuls of celery seed and 1 tablespoonful of ground cin- 
namon. Pack in a jar, add 3 cups of good cider vinegar, cover and 
set away. It will be ready for use in 5 days and keeps indefinitely 
in a cool place.

CORN RELISH 

Cut corn from cob of 18 ears, force 1 small cabbage through 
meat grinder. Separate 1 bunch of celery, remove leaves and 
chop stalks.. Peel 4 onions and cut in thin slices crosswise. Wipe 
2 green peppers and chop. Put prepared vegetables in preserving 
kettle and pour over 1 quart of vinegar. Mix thoroughly 2 cups 
of sugar, % teaspoonful cayenne, 1 cup of flour, one-half cup 
of salt, 1 teaspoonful of mustard and one-half teaspoonful of 
turmeric and add 1 quart of vinegar slowly. Combining mixtures, 
bring to the boiling point and let boil 40 minutes. Fill glass jars 
and seal.

1 Ib. Sultana raisins, */4 ounce of cayenne pepper, 

1 Ib. onions, % Ib. yellow sugar. 

Stew the apples and onions in the vinegar until well cooked and 
tender, then chop the Sultana raisins and add them, then all the 
other ingredients. Mix well and boil for half hour. When cold 
it is ready for use and makes a pleasant change with cold meats 
instead of pickle. 

APPLE RELISH 

7 Ibs. apples, 1 tsp. powdered cloves, 

2 Ibs. seeded raisins, 2 tsp. powdered cinnamon, 

1 pt. vinegar, S 1 /^ Ibs. of sugar.

Chop the raisins and put them into a porcelain-lined kettle, add 
the apples chopped and unpeeled, the juice and the chopped peel 
of the oranges, the sugar, vinegar and spices. Boil steadily for 
half hour. This relish will keep in unsealed cans all winter. 

CUCUMBER CATSUP 

Twelve large cucumbers laid in cold water for 1 hour. Pare 
and grate fine into a deep earthern dish. Grate 2 small onions 
and add the cucumbers. Season the mixture with salt, pepper and 
vinegar, making it as thick as marmalade. Mix thoroughly and 
seal in glass jars. Be sure to use pure cider vinegar and see that 
the jars are air tight. This is fine with cold meats.

quire about 3 hours. When done have ready the syrup made of 
the vinegar, sugar and spices. Tie the ground spices in a muslin 
bag and put the whole cloves in loose. These ingredients will make 
4 quarts of excellent pickle that is inexpensive and fine to serve 
with meats. 

PICKLED PEACHES 

*/2 pk. peaches, 3 pts. sugar, 

Vz pt. vinegar, A few cloves. 

% pt. water, 

Do not pare the peaches, but wipe them carefully with a clean 
cloth until smooth. Divide them into 3 equal parts. Bring the 
water, sugar and vinegar to the boiling point, then put in l /$ of 
the peaches and boil for 20 minutes; remove them to a platter, 
then put in another third and in 20 minutes the remaining third, 
until each part has been cooked for 20 minutes, thus making 1 
hour for the syrup. Stick 1 clove into each peach, put the peaches 
into jars, cover with the boiling syrup and seal at once in glass 
jars. The peaches should not be too ripe. 



CHERRY PICKLE 

7 Ibs. of red berries, \Vz ounces of whole cloves, 

3% Ibs. sugar, % pt. vinegar. 

2 1 / ounces stick cinnamon, 

Wipe the cherries, then pit and drain them. Tie the spices in 
a cheese cloth bag and heat them with the vinegar. Pour the hot 
vinegar over the cold cherries and let the mixture stand over 
night. Keep draining off and reheating each day for 3 or 4 days, 
then heat all together to the boiling point and seal. 



GINGER PEARS

MARMALADES 

A marmalade quite out of the ordinary is made with the fol- 
lowing ingredients: 

5 Ibs. rhubarb, 6 medium sized oranges, 

3 large lemons, (navels are the best), 

iy 2 Ibs. sugar, l 1 ^ Ibs. almonds. 

Wash and trim the rhubarb stalks and cut them into very thin 
slices. Peel the yellow rind very thinly from the oranges and 
lemons; remove the thick white pith, slice the pulp and add to 
rhubarb. Cut the yellow rind of 3 of the oranges and 1 lemon 
into tiny strips, add to the other ingredients with sugar in 
measure to total quantity. Tie the remainder of the peel in a 
bit of cheese cloth and remove it after the marmalade is cooked. 
Stir the mixture thoroughly and set aside over night. Boil until 
thick, about % of an hour will suffice, then add the almonds which 
have been shelled, blanched and sliced, boil for 10 minutes longer, 
pour into glasses and when cold cover with paraffin. 

AMBER OR GRAPE FRUIT MARMALADE 

1 orange, Water, 

1 lemon, Sugar. 

1 grape fruit, 

Shave the orange, the lemon and the grape fruit very thin, re- 
jecting nothing but the seeds and cores. Measure the fruit and 
add to it 3 times the quantity of water. Let it stand in an earth- 
enware dish over night and on the second morning boil for 10 min- 
utes only. Stand another night, and on the second morning add 
pint for pint of sugar, and boil steadily until it jellies. The prod- 
uct should have a lumpy appearance, quite different from most 
marmalades, the strips of fruit being well defined in a clear, pale 
jelly. To bring this about, stir as little as possible during the 

2 hours or more of cooking which is required. 

GOOSEBERRIES 

Gooseberries and oranges make an excellent marmalade. Stem 
the gooseberries, wash, drain and place in a jar with an equal 
measure of white sugar. To 3 pints of berries use 4 oranges and 
2 lemons. Peel off the rind very thinly and shred into threads. 
Cover with cup of water and let stand over night. Add the thinly 



152 "Win the War" Cook Book 

sliced pulp of the oranges and the lemons to the berries, with an 
equal measure of sugar. Let stand until following day. Add al- 
together and cook until thick, pour into glasses and serve. 

Another extremely good marmalade calls for 4 pounds of pears, 
4 lemons and a can of grated pineapple. Peel and core the pears; 
cook in enough water to prevent them from burning. Rub through 
a colander. Peel the lemons, shred the yellow rind and cut the 
pulp small; add all with the pineapple to the pears with an equal 
measure of sugar. Cook for 1 hour. This is improved by adding 
blanched shredded almonds. Let the mixture cook for 10 minutes 
longer.

and cook until thick. 

APPLE MARMALADE 

To make apple marmalade pare, quarter, core and slice 
apples to make 4 pounds, wash 3 lemons and slice them very fine; 
add them to the apples with 1 quart of water. Cook until the 
apples are soft, press through a colander, and measure; add an 
equal amount of sugar and 1 cup and a half of blanched almonds 
cut into pieces. Stir and cook until thick like jelly. Pour into 
glasses and when cold seal.

Apricots, pineapples and lemon make a marmalade which the 
college girl aptly defined as "delectable conglomerate of good 
things." Pare apricots, place in a large bowl and add an equal 
bulk of white sugar. To 5 pounds of apricots allow 1 large can of 
grated pineapple, 1 dozen apricots blanched and cut into fine 
strips and 3 lemons. Peel the lemons, cut the thin yellow rind of 2 
lemons into very small pieces and slice the pulp thinly. Boil all 
together until thick, or about % of an hour. Pour into glasses and

JELLY 

The process of jelly making seems simple, and yet it is fre- 
quently attended with uncertain results because the underlying 
principles are not understood. There are several factors. 

Fruit juice contains vegetable acids and a substance called 
pectin, both of which are essential to the jelly making process. 
The amount of each varies in the different fruits, which accounts 
for the fact that some fruits make better jelly than others. The 
ideal fruit for jelly making should be rich in pectin and should be 
fairly acid; another important consideration is the proportion of 
sugar to the juice; a given volume of juice contains a certain 
quantity of pectin in solution and this quantity of pectin must 
bear a definite relation to the proportion of sugar. Up to this 
definite amount the texture of the jelly produced more nearly ap- 
proaches the ideal, but beyond the definite proportion the jelly is 
increasing syrup, until it finally fails to hold together at all, and 
a gummy mass is the result. Experience and exercise of judg- 
ment are necessary to determine the correct amount of sugar to be 



154 "Win the War" Cook Book 

used. If fruits are gathered after a rain, or if much water is 
added, the amount of pectin will be proportionately less and the 
proportion of sugar must also be diminished. Experiments seem 
to indicate that the correct proportion of sugar to juice varies 
from three-fourths of a volume to one volume of sugar, to one 
volume of fruit juice. 

The time during the process when the sugar should be added 
to the juice is also important. Experiments seem to indicate that 
to add it near either the beginning or to the end of the process is 
likely to result in crystallization of the sugar. If added at the 
beginning of the process the sugar is changed by the action of 
the acid into two simple sugars, one of which is apt to crystallize. 
If added near the end of the process the original sugar may 
crystallize. If added midway in the process the sugar is only par- 
tially changed and is less likely to crystallize. 

Experiments show that there is no difference in the texture, 
taste or appearance of jelly made from cane or beet sugar if these 
are equally pure. There is a slight difference in the volume of 
jelly made from a given amount of juice, the amount being 
slightly less when beet sugar is used. However, the difference is 
so small as to be almost negligible. 

TO STERILIZE GLASSES 

The process is the same as for sterilizing jars. 

TO FILL AND TO SEAL 

Fill the glasses, pour a layer of melted paraffin over the top, 
adjust the covers, label, and set away in a dry place. 

APPLE JELLY 

Wipe, quarter and core the apples, cover with cold water. Heat 
slowly and simmer until the apples are reduced to a pulp. Drain 
through a double thickness of cheese cloth or jelly bag. Measure 
and allow % amount of sugar. Boil juice 15 minutes, add the 
sugar, heated in the warming oven, and continue boiling 10 
minutes, skim, fill glasses, seal. 

SMALL FRUIT JELLY 

Green or ripe grapes, currants, cranberries, raspberries, black- 
berries, etc., may be used. Pick, wash and drain fruit, cook until 
juice is extracted from fruit. Follow directions for Apple Jelly.

sible other foods for wheat, beef, pork, dairy products and 
sugar, and reduce consumption where it is excessive. 
9. Let us at this time utterly repeat the old saying that the waste 
in the kitchen of a prosperous American household would feed 
a French family. 

10. Wastefulness: The elimination of waste will save literally 
billions of dollars for the American people, and at the same 
time not disrupt in any degree the industrial progress of the 
nation. 

TO SAVE GAS OR FUEL 

Save Gas Never leave burner lighted while preparing material 
-better to use an extra match. 

When oven is used plan to bake at same time a roast, apples, po- 
tatoes and a pudding or cake. 

The boiling point is 212 F. No amount of heat will make it 
higher. Notice this and turn flame accordingly. 

There are three-cornered sauce pans 3 vegetables or sauces 
may be cooked at one time. 



Rules for Red Cross Knitting 

This circular is prepared primarily for the use of hand knit- 
ters. Knitting machines may be used if desired, provided the 
articles can be as well made and made of the same yarn. 

The color of the yarn has been carefully considered with the 
authorities of the War Department, and with the American Red 
Cross Commissioner 'for Europe, in Paris. It has been learned 
from both of these sources that articles made in either gray or 
khaki yarn will be acceptable. Owing to the difficulty in securing 
khaki-colored yarn in large quantities, the American Red Cross 
Supply Bureau will carry the gray yarn (oxford mixture, 4-ply 
10's construction). 

Yarn and knitting needles may be procured either from Red 
Cross Chapters or from stores, provided the yarn is of the same 
grade and needles of the same size as those described here. 

The needles referred to in these directions are standardized Red 
Cross needles which can be purchased from Red Cross Chapters. 
Their diameter is given opposite their respective number. 

Red Cross Needles No. 1125/1000 inches. 
Red Cross Needles No. 2175/1000 inches. 
Red Cross Needles No. 3200/1000 inches. 

Stitches should not be cast on too tightly. Knitting should be 
done evenly and firmly, and all holes should be avoided. 

Joining should be done by splicing or by leaving two or three 
inches at each end of the yarn to be darned in carefully. 

All knots, ridges or lumps should be most carefully avoided, 
especially in socks, as they are apt to blister the feet. 

SLEEVELESS SWEATERS 

Two and one-half hanks yarn (% lb.). 1 pair Red Cross 
Needles No. 3.

WHEN DAY IS DONE 

I have eaten a bale 
Of spinach and kale, 

And I've never raised a row. 
I have swallowed a can 
Of moistened bran, 

And feel like a brindle cow. 
I am taking a snack 
From the old haystack, 

In the evening shadows gray, 
And I'm glad, you bet, 
At last to get 

To the end of a meatless day.

Look to Your Range Oven to help 

CONSERVE 
FOOD :: :: 





Ever think of the food waste 
that evaporates from a loosely 
constructed oven? There is no 
conservation in putting two 
pounds of dough in your oven 
and taking out a 1J/2 pound 
loaf of bread half a pound 
wasted through' the cracks. 

The oven of a cast iron range or cook stove is not tight at least not after 
expansion and contraction caused the stove putty to fall out exposing large 
cracks. Some of your food is bound to get out of that kind of oven. You 
don't realize it, but in a year's time it means a tremendous waste, to say 
nothing of the fuel wasted to heat the oven and the food wasted through 
improper baking burnt on one side and not done on the other. 

Not so with the 

GREAT MAJESTIC RANGE 

it's made of nonbreakable malleable iron and rust-resisting charcoal iron 
all joints are rivet tight not an ounce of stove putty used. It stays tight 
and bakes right always. It positively reduces food 
and fuel waste to the minimum.

MAJESTIC in Your Kitchen
