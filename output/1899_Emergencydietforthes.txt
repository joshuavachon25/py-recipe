OATMEAT. I'OinniXiK. 

Three tablespoonfuls of oatmeal. 

One pint of boiliny water. 

One-fourth teaspoonful of salt . 

Cook for two hours in a double boiler. 
Oatmeal is very appetizing when served cokl 
in mold shapes, and it will fre(iuently be eaten 
in this way when it would 1)e refused if served 
in any other form. Variations may be made 
by using farina, browm^d rice (browned in the 
oven before steaming and molding), arrowroot, 
etc., giving further change by serving occa- 
sionally with sweetened fruit juices, fresh, 
dried or canned, instead of creniii oi' milk.

RECIPBS. 



The following recipes are planned to include 
such simple, digestible, appetizing, and readily 
prepared articles of diet, especially adapted to 
the needs of the sick, as may be made from 
the components of the several rations used in 
the field or an detached service, the foods in- 
cluded in the hospital stores and a few special 
articles selected for their nutritive value, ease 
of preparation, palatability, and probable avail- 
ability under ordinary circumstances. While 
the number of articles of diet which can be 
made from these food-stuffs might be consid- 
erably augmented, it is believed that the selec- 
tion made herein is sufficiently ample to meet 
the requirements of any emergency. Many 
food materials having a known value in the 
nourishment of the sick are not included in 
this list; not because their utility is unrecog- 
nized or underestimated, but through the fact 
that their special characteristics and the condi- 
tions of campaign or field service are such that 
they would probably be unattainable at the 
time when most to be desired. The Hospital

10 RECIPES. 

Corps man should, therefore, in his care of the 
sick, understand how to make the best use of 
such articles of food as may be confidently- 
expected to be available, either wholly or in 
large part, under any conditions under which 
troops may be required to serve. 



MQUID DIET. 



STERILIZED MIL.K. 

Potir the milk into a granite saucepan (or a 
double boiler) and raise temperature of milk 
to about 190° Fahrenheit. Keep it at this 
point for one hour. Do not boil the milk. 
Any utensil used for this purpose must be 
absolutely clean. 

MIL.K PUNCH. 

One cup of milk. 

Two tablespoonfuls of brandy or whisky. 

One teaspoonful of sugar. 

Grated nutmeg, to taste. 

Sweeten the milk (preferably sterilized) with 
the sugar. Stir into it the brandy. Shake it 
up well by pouring from one cup to another, 



RECIPES. 11 

or by the use of a milk shaker, until a froth is 
formed. Grate a little nutmeg on top, and 
serve. 

The term ' ' cup" in this recipe, as in all others, 
means the tea cup, holding eight ounces. 

MIX.K WITH MINERAL. OR AERATED WATERS. 

Mix equal quantities of sterilized milk with 
seltzer, soda water, or lime water, and serve 
immediately. 

AL.BUMENIZED MILK. 

Beat up the white of an egg till light. Add 
a good-sized pinch of salt and four ounces of 
fresh, cool milk which has been sterilized. A 
little sugar may be added if desired. 

PEPTONIZED MILK (COLD PROCESS). 

Into a clean quart bottle put the contents 
of one peptonizing tube, mixing it with four 
ounces of cold water. Add one pint of fresh 
cold milk, shake thoroughly and place the bot- 
tle on ice. Use clean cotton to plug the bottle. 

In place of the peptonizing powder, five 
grains of pepsin and fifteen grains of .sodium 
bicarbonate, to be obtained from the dispen- 
sary, may be employed. 



12 RECIPES. 

PEPTONIZED MILK (WARM PROCESS). 

Into a clean quart jar or bottle put the pow- 
der contained in one of the tubes above men- 
tioned, together with four ounces of cold water. 
Add one pint of fresh milk and shake the whole 
well. Place the bottle in a pan or kettle of 
hot water maintained at such a temperature 
that the hand can just be held in it without 
discomfort. Keep the bottle in the water for 
ten minutes. Put on the ice immediately after 
removing from the hot bath to check further 
digestion. If ice is not available, pour the 
milk into a saucepan and heat quickly to 
boiling. 

WHEX. 

Warm one pint of milk to about blood heat, 
100° Fahrenheit. Dissolve half a rennet tablet 
in one tablespoonful of cold water. Stir it 
into the milk and let stand until the latter 
is curdled, which will be in a few minutes. 
Break up the curd with a fork and strain oflf 
the liquid (whey) . This may be sweetened with 
sugar, and when cooled makes a refreshing 
drink for fever patients. 

JUNKET. 

Heat one pint of fresh unboiled milk to 
about blood heat, 100° Fahrenheit. Dissolve 



RECIPES. 13 

a full tablespoonful of sugar in it. Add half 
a rennet tablet which has been dissolved in 
one tablespoonful of cold water. It will set 
the milk in about fifteen minutes. Put in a 
cool place till ready to be used. It can be 
served plain, or with cream, sugar, and a little 
nutmeg. 

OATMEAL GRUEL. 

Two tablespoonful s of oatmeal. (Rolled 
oats.) 

One pint of water. 

One-half teaspoonful of salt. 

One teaspoonful of sugar. 

Heat the water to boiling. Add the salt and 
then the oatmeal. Cook it in a saucepan for 
thirty minutes on the fire or in a double boiler 
for two hours, then strain through a fine wire 
strainer or piece of clean gauze. If fresh 
railk is to be had, use it to flavor; if not, use 
condensed milk, one teaspoonful to the half 
pint of gruel. 

FARIXA GRUEL. 

One tablespoonful of farina. 
One pint of water. 
One teaspoonful of sugar. 
One-half teaspoonful of salt. 
Into one pint of water, raised to boiling, put 
a half teaspoonful of salt; then add the farina 



14 RECIPES. 

and cook for twenty minutes. Flavor with 
sugar and condensed milk, if fresh milk is not 
available. Strain and serve hot. 

In this recipe, as in others, condensed milk 
is used in a strength of one teaspoonful to the 
half pint of gruel. 

RICE GRUEL. 

Two tablespoonf uls of rice, or 

One tablespoonful of rice flour. 

One pint of boiling water. 

One-half teaspoonful of salt. 

One tea^oonful of sugar. 

Wash the rice thoroughly in two waters 
after removing any specks that may be mixed 
in the grain. Have the cooking water boiling. 
Add the salt and then the rice. Boil for two 
hours, when the rice should be almost entirely 
dissolved. Strain. Add condensed milk and 
sugar, if desired. Some persons prefer the 
use of salt alone. 

If ground rice or rice flour is used it should 
be mixed with cold water before mixing with 
boiling water and requires but thirty minutes 
boiling. Flavor with sugar or condensed milk. 

HARD-BREAD GRUEL,. 

Toast hard-bread thoroughly and grind it 
into a powder. To one pint of boiling water, to 



RECIPES. 15 

which one-half teaspoonful of salt has been 
added, add two tablespoonfuls of hard-bread 
powder. Boil ten minutes and then strain. 
Flavor with one teaspoonful of sugar and one 
teaspoonful of condensed milk to each cupful 
of the gruel. 

ARROWROOT GRUEL<. 

One tablespoonful of arrowroot. 

One pint of hot water. 

One teaspoonful of sugar. 

One-third teaspoonful of salt. 

Wet the arrowroot with two tablespoonfuls 
of cold water, mixing the salt and sugar with 
it. Pour on the hot water and boil for twenty 
minutes, stirring constantly . Arrowroot gruel 
may be flavored with cinnamon by boiling a 
small piece in the water with which the gruel 
is inade. Nutmeg, lemon peel, lemon juice, 
or sherry wine may be used for flavoring; 
but the sherry should be avoided unless the 
gruel is to be served cold. 

LEMONADE. 

One lemon. 

One tablespoonful of sugar. 
One cup of water. 

Wash and wipe the lemon. Squeeze the 
juice into a glass or bowl. Then add the 



16 RECIPES.

at once. Boiled or sterilized water should be 
used. 

ORANGEADE. 

One orange. 

One teaspoonful of sugar. 

One cup of water. 

Wash and wipe the orange. Squeeze the 
juice into the sugar. Add the cold water, pre- 
viously boiled. Strain and serve. 

EGG-NOG. 

One egg. 

Two teaspoonfuls of sugar. 

One cup of milk. 

Salt, to taste. 

Beat the egg up till light. Add sugar and 
salt and then the milji, which is better when 
not too cold. With the addition of one or two 
tablespoonfuls of brandy this makes a v%ry 
strengthening drink for convalescents. 

EGG liEMOXADE. 

One egg. 

One small lemon. 

Two teaspoonfuls of sugar. 

Beat up the white and yolk of the egg separ- 
ately ; add sugar to yolk. When both are light, 
mix them together and add the strained juice 
of the lemon. Pour into a glass and serve with 
a spoon. 



RECIPES. 17 

A little cold water maybe added if the beaten- 
egg is too foamy. 

SHERRY AXD EGG. 

One egg. 

One teaspoonfnl of sugar. 

Two tablespoonfuls of sherry wine. 

Break the egg into a bowl and add the sugar.

roughly mixed. Add two tablespoonfuls of 
sherry wine and an equal quantity of cold 
water. Mix thoroughly, strain, and serve 
immediately. 

TOA8T WATER. 

Toast three slices of soft bread till very 
brown and dry throughout. Break up fine, 
add one pint of boiling water, and set aside 
for fifteen minutes. Turn into a strainer or 
piece of gauze and strain. The water thus 
obtained may be used plain or a little sugar 
or condensed milk may be added. It may be 
served either hot or cold.

18 RECIPES. 

Let the whole come to a boil and then set aside 
for five or ten minutes to steepand settle before 
using. If muddy it may be cleared by boil- 
ing with egg shells, or, in their absence, by a 
dash of cold water. Add sugar and milk to 
flavor as desired. 

TEA. 

To each half pint of boiling water add one 
teaspoonful of tea. Let it steep or infuse for 
five minutes. Never let tea boil. Add sugar 
and milk to flavor as desired. 

BEEF JUICE. 

Cut a lean piece of steak, from the round or 
other good portion, about one half pound in 
weight. Remove all fat and fibrous tissue. 
Broil over a clear, hot fire so that it becomes 
pink and full of juice. It should not be merely 
done on the outside and raw inside. Cut into 
small pieces and squeeze out the juice. Add a 
little salt and it is ready to serve. 

If it is needed warm, place the cup holding 
the juice in a bowl of warm water. Do not 
let the temperature of this water exceed 160° 
Fahrenheit. 

BEEF JUICE (BOTTI.ED). 

Choose a good, well-flavored piece of beef, 
half a pound in weight. Cut away the fat, 



RECIPES. 19 

leaving only the lean. Cut this up into small 
pieces. Put it into a clean glass jar, and cover 
the latter. Set the jar in a deep saucepan of 
cold water and heat gradually for one hour. 
Then strain out the juice and press the meat. 
Add a little salt, and serve. 

If the temperature of the water exceeds 160° 
Fahrenheit, the beef juice becomes brown and 
flaky. A half pound of beef should give from 
three to four tablespoonfuls of juice. 

BEEF TEA (BOTTLED). 

Select and prepare the beef as for bottled beef 
juice, except that to each half pound of meat a 
cup of cold water should be added, pouriug 
the water over the beef after it has been put 
in the jar. The liquid thus obtained will 
resemble the beef juice in every respect except 
strength. Add a little salt and serve. 

BEEF TEA WITH HYI>ROCIIL<OUIC ACID. 

Select and prepare the beef as above. Put 
in a bowl and pour over it one cupful of cold 
water, to which five drops of dilute hydro- 
chloric acid have been added. Let the whole 
stand for two hours in a cool place. Strain, add 
salt to flavor, and serve cold. This tea may be 
heated, but the albumen which coagulates and 



20 RECIPES. 

appears as brown flakes should not be strained 
out, for it is the nutritious portion of the tea. 

BEEF (OR MUTTOX) BROTH. 

One pound of lean beef (or mutton). 

One quart of water. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Soak the meat, previously chopped fine, in 
the cold salted water for at least two hours, in 
the vessel in which it is to be cooked; keeping 
it on ice or in a cool place during this time. 
Then expose to moderate heat. Keep the ves- 
sel covered and allow the broth to simmer, 
keeping up the original quantity of water, for 
three hours at least. Let it cool over night, 
skim off the fat in the morning, and keep cov- 
ered in a cool place until needed. Heat and 
serve as required. 

CIIICKEX BROTH. 

Fowls are better to use for broth than young 
chickens. Pluck and prepare by singeing with 
a blazing newspaper, straw, or dry grass. Re- 
move all refuse — entrails, oil-bag, crop, lungs, 
etc. Wash well in cold water ; then cut up 
and disjoint. Put one pound of chicken into 
a quart of cold salted water and simmer for 
two hours ; then boil for two hours. Add rice 



RECIPES. 21 

or powdered hard-bread or soft bread crumbs 
in the proportion of one tablespoonful to each 
quart of water. Vegetables, such as onions, 
garlic, carrots, celery, and parsley may also be 
used, a tablespoonful to the quart, and should 
be put in when the broth is first put on to cook. 
Strain, remove the fat and serve hot. 

CA:>rNEi> SOUPS. 

To render canned soups ready for eating, 
simply raise them to the boiling point either 
by immersing the cans in boiling water for 
half an hour to thoroughly heat the contents, 
or by emptying and heating the same in a 
granite saucepan. After diluting with the 
proper amount of water, following directions 
on the cans, they are ready to serve. Before 
heating any canned article a hole should be 
punctured in the upper end of the can. 

CliAM BROTH (CANNED). 

• 

This may be served hot or cold. If the 
broth is desired plain, simply heat to the tem- 
perature required. Do not boil. It can also 
be given iced ; and if fresh milk is available, 
use equal parts of milk and clam juice, heated.

POACHED EGGS. 

Pour sufficient boiling water into a clean 
cooking utensil and add salt in the proportion 
of one teaspoonf ul to the quart of water. Place 
it on the stove to boil. Break a fresh egg into 
a small dish and when the water boils slide 
the eggs gently into it. When the albumen or 
white is firm, or at the end of two minutes, 
lift the egg out of the water with a skimmer 
and place on a piece of hot, nicely browned 
toast or hard-tack. Sprinkle with a little salt 
and pepper and serve hot. 

SOFT COOKED EGGS. 

Put into a saucepan as many eggs as are to 
be cooked. Pour over them water enough to 
cover. The water should have been brought 
up not quite to the boiling point. Let the eggs 
stay in the water from seven to ten minutes and 
the result is an evenly cooked egg throughout. 
When the water is poured on the eggs do not 
set the pan on the stove. No further heating 
is required, but the water should not be 
allowed to cool down too rapidly. 



RECIPES. 23 

BOILED EGGS. 

Carefully put into boiling water as many 
eggs as are to be cooked. For soft boiled 
eggs leave in three minutes and then at once 
remove. For hard boiled eggs boil from seven 
to ten minutes. 

OMELET. 

Two eggs. 

Two tablespoonfuls of milk, cream, or water. 

One-fourth tablespoonful of salt. 

Pepper, to taste. 

Beat up the yolks and whites separately. 
Add the salt to the yolks. Mix the whites 
and yolks together with the milk, cream, or 
water. Place a small piece of butter or bacon 
fat in a pan or plate hot enough to melt it. 
Pour in the omelet and with a sharp knife 
loosen the edges and fold over into a half circle. 
When done, turn out on a plate and serve hot. 
When milk can not be had water may be used. 

Spanish omelet has minced onion added to 
the above. An excellent addition to the plain 
omelet is a dressing made of canned tomatoes 
and boiled crumbled hard-bread, strained, sea- 
soned, and heated together. Never use flour 
in an omelet, as it can not be cooked sufiiciently 
in the short time that should be given to eggs. 



24 RECIPES. 

BAKED CUSTARD. 

One pint of fresh milk. 

Two eggs. 

One-third teaspoonful of salt. 

Two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

Small piece of cinnamon. 

Put the cinnamon in the milk and pour into 
a saucepan to heat. Break the eggs into a bowl 
with the sugar and salt and beat until well 
mixed but not light. When the milk comes 
to a boil pour it over the eggs. Stir slowly 
to dissolve the sugar. Strain the mixture into 
cups, set them in a deep pan of boiling water 
and bake for twenty minutes in a moderately 
hot oven. 

DRY TOAST. 

Cut the bread in slices one-third of an inch 
in thickness. Toast may be made either by 
drying bread in an oven and then placing in 
toaster over fire ; or the bread may be allowed 
to dry and brown in the oven. Toast that is 
moist and soft in the middle should never be 
given an invalid. Have it dry, crisp through- 
out, and of a golden brown in color. Serve 
hot, either dry or buttered. 

MIL<K TOAST. 

Put a cup of milk into a saucepan and let it 
heat to the boiling point. Have ready three 



RECIPES. 25 

slices of nicely browned toast. Put a little salt 
in the milk and pour it over the toast. A little 
butter may be spread on the latter, but it is a 
more delicate dish without it. Serve hot. 

OATMEAL PORRIDGE. 

Three tablespoonfuls of oatmeal. 

One pint of boiling water. 

One-fourth teaspoonful of salt. 

Cook for two hours in a double boiler. 
Oatmeal is very appetizing when served cold 
in mold shapes, and it will frequently be eaten 
in this way when it would be refused if served 
in any other form. Variations may be made 
by using farina, browned rice (browned in the 
oven before steaming and molding), arrowroot, 
etc., giving further change by serving occa- 
sionally with sweetened fruit juices, fresh, 
dried or canned, instead of cream or milk. 

OATMEAL, MUSH. 

One cup of oatmeal. (Rolled oats.) 

Three cups of boiling water. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Pick over the oatmeal before using. Boil for 
half an hour. Coarse oatmeal requires from 
two to three hours cooking. Salt should be 
added to the water before the oatmeal is put in. 



26 RECIPES. 

FARINA MUSH OR PORRIDGE. 

Three tablespoonfuls of farina. 

One pint of boiling water. 

One-half teaspoonful of salt. 

The water must be boiling before putting in 
the farina. Boil for half an hour. It may be 
served with fresh milk, or condensed milk 
diluted one to four parts of boiling water, 
or with stewed dried fruit, such as prunes, 
peaches, or apples. Cold farina mush may be 
sliced and fried for the use of convalescents. 

PLAIN BOILED RICE. 

One-half cup of rice. 

Two cups of boiling water. 

One-half teaspoonful of salt. 

Pick the rice clean. Wash thoroughly in 
two waters, pouring ofif the last when ready to 
put the rice into the boiling water. Pour in 
the rice and boil steadily for half an hour. In 
order to see if the rice is done take out some of 
the grains and crush between the fingers. If 
done it will mash easily and feel perfectly soft. 
Do not stir the rice, as this will cause it to fall 
to the bottom and burn. Serve with sugar and 
fresh or condensed milk, or with stewed fruits. 



RECIPES. 27 

STEAMED RICE. 

Wash the rice thoroughly in two waters. 
Use in same proportions as are given 'for boiled 
rice. Use a double boiler. Have the water 
boiling in lower boiler. Place the above mix- 
ture of rice, boiling water, and salt in the upper 
chamberand letcook foronehour. Donot stir. 
Keep the rice covered while steaming, and keep 
the lower boiler well supplied with boiling 
water. Serve as with boiled rice. 

MIL.K PORRIDGE. 

The flour for milk porridge should be pre- 
pared in the following manner: Tie up in a 
muslin bag or a towel as much flour as desired 
and boil for four or five hours ; then bake until 
dry in an oven. To make the porridge grate 
two tablespoonfuls of the dried flour, mix it 
with cold water into a paste and add to it one 
pint of boiling milk or boiling water. Boil for 
ten minutes. If water alone is used to make 
the porridge, condensed or fresh milk may be 
used in addition, in equal parts or diluted one- 
half with water. 

Condensed milk used in this recipe is made

L.EMON JEL.L.Y. 

One- fourth box of gelatine. 

One-fourth cup of cold water. 

One-fourth cup of fresh lemon juice (about 
the amount yielded by two lemons). 

Three tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

One and one-fourth cups of boiling water. 

Put the gelatine to soak in the cold water, 
about twenty minutes being required for this 
process. When dissolved pour on the boiling 
water. Add the lemon juice and sugar. Stir 
thoroughly and strain through a fine-meshed 
cloth into a china or granite- ware mold, cool- 
ing in a refrigerator or by placing in a pan of 
cold water. Never use tin molds for lemon 
jelly. 

COFFEE JEL.L.Y. 

One-fourth box of gelatine. 

One-fourth cup of cold water. 

One cup of boiling water. 

One-half cup of strong coffee. 

Two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

Soak the gelatine in the cold water for half 
an hour. Pour on the boiling water, then put 
in the sugar and coffee. Strain it through a 
cloth into a mold or dish in which it may be 
cooled, either in a pan of iced water or in a

refrigerator. CoflPee jelly may be served with 
cream and sugar. 

Have the coflFee strong, two tablespoonfuls 
of coffee to each cup of water. Where vanilla 
extract is available, one-half teaspoonful will 
be advantageously added to the above recipe. 

WINE JEL.L.Y. 

One-fourth box of gelatine. 

One-fourth cup of cold water. 

One-half cup of sugar. 

One-half cup of sherry wine. 

One and one- fourth cups of boiling water. 

One small piece of cinnamon. 

Put the gelatine and cold water together in 
a dish large enough to hold the whole mixture. 
Let it soak for half an hour; then pour the 
boiling water (in which the piece of cinnamon 
has been simmering) over the softened gela- 
tine. Add the sugar and wine, strain through 
a clean cloth into a china or granite-ware 
mold, and cool it in a refrigerator or a pan of 
cold water. 

STEWED PRUXES. 

One pint of prunes. 
One and one-half pints of water. 
One-fourth cup of sugar. 
Juice of one lemon. 



30 RECIPES. 

Soak the prunes for fifteen minutes in warm 
water to soften the dirt. Wash carefully, 
rejecting those that feel granular or are worm- 
eaten. Stew them in the sugar and water in 
a covered saucepan from one to two hours, or 
until tender. The fruit should be plump, soft, 
and tender to the stone. As the water evapo- 
rates restore the amount so that there will be 
as much at the end as at the beginning of the 
cooking. Add the lemon juice before taking 
off the fire. Cool, and serve. 

STEW^ED DRIED APPL.ES, APRICOTS, OR 

PEACHES. 

Wash the fruit thoroughly. Soak for four 
or five hours in the cold water it is to be 
cooked in, using only a suflBcient quantity of 
water to cover. Heat in a covered granite-ware 
saucepan, simmering slowly for two hours. 
Do not boil. If the fruit is allowed to simmer 
it will not burn or need stirring, which breaks 
it up and makes it look unsightly.. > Apricots 
need plenty of sugar, but this should not be 
added until five minutes before taking off the 
fire. Lemon juice or lemon peel may be added 
to poorly flavored apples, a tablespoonful of 
the juice or the peel of half a lemon to the 



RECIPES. 31 

pound of fruit ; or spices may be used for fla- 
voring. The use of brown sugar is to be pre- 
ferred for this purpose because of the better 
flavor which it gives. 

STEWED RAVT APPL.ES. 

Wash, pare, and core three apples (tart are 
best) ; put them into a saucepan with a cup of 
water and two tablespoonfuls of sugar, aud 
stew gently till they are soft, but not broken. 
A tablespoonful of lemon juice may be added 
before they are taken from the fire if the 
apples are poor in flavor. A bit of lemon peel, 
cinnamon, or cloves is also a good addition. 

Any wholesome acid fruit can be prepared 
in about the same manner. 

BAKED APPL.E8. 

Select fair, sound, and preferably tart apples. 
Wash and wipe them and cut out the cores, 
removing all the seeds and husks. Cut off 
any dark spots on the outside. Put the pre- 
pared apples into a granite or earthen ware 
dish. Put into each apple from one-half to 
one teaspoonful of sugar, according to the 
acidity of the fruit, and a bit of lemon peel. 
Pour boiling water into the dish about one- 
fourth inch deep and bake in a moderately

hot oven. When perfectly soft all through 
the fruit is done. The time for baking varies, 
according to the species of apple, from half an 
hour to two hours. 

CANNED FRUIT, SERVING OF. 

Remove from cans several hours before 
using and put in porcelain or granite-ware 
dish to cool. Canned fruit is much improved 
by cooling, being more palatable and refresh- 
ing than if served direct from the can. Never 
allow fruit to remain in cans when once 
opened. This applies particularly to very 
acid fruit, and also to meats, fish, or vege- 
tables. 

BAKED POTATOES. 

Have the potatoes of a uniform size, so that 
all may be done at the same time. Wash them 
thoroughly and bake in a hot oven from forty- 
five to fifty minutes. They are recognized as 
being done by the soft, yielding sensation given 
on pinching. 

ROASTED POTATOES. 

Bury under the hot ashes of an open fire 
(camp) for half an hour or more. Break open 
by squeezing. Brush the ashes oflP first. 



RECIPES. 33 

BOIIiED POTATOES. 

Wash the potatoes well. Pare carefully so 
as not to waste. Put them on to cook in boil- 
ing salted water, enough to cover, and let boil 
for thirty minutes. It requires more time for 
large size potatoes. When easily pierced by 
a fork they are done. Drain off the water and 
dry them on top of the stove by moving the 
boiler back and forth for a minute or two. 
Serve as quickly as possible after they are 
cooked. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Prepare as for boiled potatoes. When cooked 
drain off the water and mash in the dish in 
which they were boiled. Add butter, pepper, 
and salt, to taste, and lastly put in a little milk 
or cream. Whip up lightly and serve imme- 
diately. Keep the dish covered until served. 

SCRAPED BEEF. 

Cut a piece of steak from the round, about 
half a pound in weight and about an inch 
thick. Lay it on a clean meat board and with 
a sharp knife scrape off* the pulp until there 
is nothing left but stringy fiber. Season the 
scraped pulp with salt and make it into small 
cakes. Broil for two minutes either by direct 
heat over a clear fire or by heating a clean pan

or plate and, when hot, placing the meat on it. 
Have both sides cooked sufficiently. This is a 
safe way for a patient to begin taking solid 
food. Scraped beef may be prepared very 
easily over an alcohol lamp. 

BROILED BEEF (STEAK). 

Have a clear, hot fire, either coal or char- 
coal. Pnt the steak on a broiler, place directly 
over the fire for about a minute, then turn 
and do same with other side. By applying 
greater heat at the outset the juices are kept 
in the meat. It requires from five to seven 
minutes over a clear fire to broil a steak an 
inch thick. Season both sides with salt and a 
little pepper, but no butter. Serve hot. A 
baked potato is a good vegetable to serve with 
the above, as is also boiled rice. 

Another good way to broil steak is to heat a 
granite-ware plate on a stove till it is quite hot. 
Place the steak on it till one side is done ; then 
turn it and do same with other side. 

STET^ED CHICKEX. 

Boil a chicken^, prepared as for broth, until 
tender. Set it away till it is cool. Skim off 
the fat ; take the meat and cut it up in cubes 



RECIPES. 35 

or small pieces, rejecting all skin, gristle, ten- 
dons, and bones. To one cnpf ul of the meat add 
one pint of the broth, seasoning with salt and 
pepper. Mix one teaspoonfnl of flour with a 
little cold water ; blend it thoroughly, and add 
it to the chicken. Let it stew for ten minutes, 
and serve with toast or boiled rice. 

MIXCED CHICKEN ON TOAST. 

Prepare the chicken as for broth. When 
cool, skim oflp the fat and cut up the meat fine, 
rejecting all skin, tendons, gristle, and bone. 
Season with salt and a little pepper. Add 
enough broth, or, better yet, cream, if avail- 
able, to make it of the proper consistency, or 
about that of cream. Have ready some nicely- 
browned dry toast, pour the minced chicken 
over it, and serve hot.

BEEF EXTRACT (LIQUID). 

To half a pint of cold, sterilized water add 
half a teaspoonful to one teaspoonf ul of the 
liquid extract. Mix thoroughly ; season with 
salt and pepper to taste, and, if obtainable, 
with celery salt. 



36 RECIPES. 

Where a hot beef tea is required the above 
preparation may be heated, care being taken 
not to remove the nutritions curdy flakes pro- 
duced by boiling. 

MALTED MILK. 

Mix one or two tablespoonfuls^ of malted 
milk with a like quantity of warm, boiled 
water. Add more water to make up half a 
pint. Season with salt to taste. 

Boiling water can not be used to advantage 
in making up this preparation. 

CHOCOLATE. 

Grate one ounce of chocolate. Have ready 
one pint of boiling milk. Mix the grated choco- 
late with some hot milk into a paste, add it to 
the boiling milk and boil five or six min- 
utes. Flavor with sugar, one teaspoonf ul to 
the pint. If fresh milk is not available, make 
the chocolate with boiling water and add one 
teaspoonf ul of condensed milk to each half pint 
of chocolate. 

ARROWROOT BLANC-MANGE. 

Two tablespoonf uls of arrowroot. 
Two-thirds pint of hot water. 
Two tablespoonf uls of sherry or brandy. 
Two teaspoonfuls of sugar. 



re;cipes. 37 

Mix the arrowroot into a smooth paste with 
three tablespoonf uls of cold water. Add this 
to the hot water. Bring to a boil, stirring 
constantly till well blended and free from 
lumps. Let boil for ten minutes. Add the 
sugar and sherry or brandy. Beat up quickly 
and pour into a bowl or mold to cool. Arrow- 
root blanc-mange may be made with fresh hot 
milk or condensed milk diluted. If boiling 
water is used it causes the starch of the arrow- 
root, when first poured in, to form into lumps. 
Hence it is best to have the water not quite at 
boiling point. 



THE RATIONS. 



HARO-BREAD TOAST WATER. 

Two tablespoonf uls of powdered hard-bread. 

One pint of boiling water. 

One-half teaspoonf ul of salt. 

Add the powdered hard-bread, after toasting 
or parching in an oven, to the salted boiling 
water. Boil for ten minutes. Strain through 
gauze and serve hot or cold. The toast water 
may be flavored with sugar, condensed milk, 
or whisky. 



38 RECIPES. 

HARD-BREAD GRUEL. 

Four tablespoonf uls of powdered hard-bread. 
One pint of boiling water. 
One-half teaspoonfnl of salt. 
Prepare in the same manner as the hard- 
bread toast water. 

HARD-BREAD MUSH OR PORRIDGE. 

One cup of powdered hard-bread. 

Four cups of boiling water. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Mix and boil for twenty minutes. The mush 
may be eaten with condensed milk or stewed 
dried fruit. 

Care should be taken to prevent scorching 
by frequent stirring; and the water should be 
boiling in all cases before adding the powdered 
bread. 

HARD-BREAD AS MILK TOAST. 

Toast two or three pieces of hard-bread to a 
good brown color by placing in an oven or 
over clear fire on a toaster. When done pour 
enough boiling water over them to soften 
thoroughly. Dilute two tablespoonfuls of 
condensed milk in four times as much boiling 
water. Drain off the water from the toasted 
bread and pour on the milk. Serve hot. 



RECIPES. 39 

HARD-BREAD AND DRIED APPL.ES (BROTTN 

BETTY). 

Soak the dried apples for at least four hours. 
Grease a baking pan or dish and place in it 
first a layer of sliced apples, then a layer of 
hard-bread crumbs, or whole hard-bread soft- 
ened in boiling water for ten minutes, with 
small quantities of butter or fat pork and 
sugar, and ground cinnamon sprinkled over 
each layer. Continue till the dish is full, hav- 
ing bread crumbs for the top layer. Moisten 
with a cup of water, or fresh or diluted con- 
densed milk, and bake for three-quarters of an 
hour in a moderately heated oven. When a 
fork easily pierces the apples the pudding is 
cooked. It can be eaten hot or cold with but- 
ter and sugar creamed together and flavored 
with cinnamon or nutmeg; with a simple sirup 
of sugar and water, or with the following 
sauce : 

SAUCE FOR HARD-BREAD PUDDIN^G. 

One pint of boiling water. 
One tablespoonful of flour. 
One-half cup of sugar. 
One lemon. 

To the water add the flour, mixed into a paste 
with three tablespoonf uls of cold water. Boil

for ten minutes. Add the sugar and lemon 
juice, strained ; or other flavoring to taste. 

BACOX, BROII^ED. 

Wash in cold water. Cut in thin slices and 
broil over clear coals either on a broiler or with 
a fork over a charcoal fire. Serve immediately. 

BACON, FRIED. 

Cut in thin slices after washing, roll in hard- 
bread crumbs and fry in a very hot pan which 
has been greased. Season with pepper and 
serve immediately. The bacon may be fried 
without the bread crumbs, if preferred. 

BACOX, BOUSED. 

Wash the bacon in cold water. Scrape and 
trim oflp any rusty or brownish spots, and if 
very hard or dry, soak for a few hours in cold 
water. Put it on to cook in enough cold water 
to cover it well, let it come slowly to a boil 
and then boil steadily until done. As the 
water evaporates or boils away replenish it 
with more boiling water. When the bacon 
can be easily pierced with a fork in the thickest 
part it is done. Save the fat, it will be useful 
in frying; and if greens are to be cooked leave 
enough in the water to season them. 



RECIPES. 41 

CANl^ED ROAST BEEF, SOUP. 

One pound (one-half can) of roast beef. 

One pint of cold water. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 

Cut the beef into small pieces and add it to 
the cold water. Let it come to a boil and then 
simmer gently for half an hour. Skim off the 
fat and strain, taking care to express all the 
meat juice and gelatine from the meat. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper to taste. A little 
beef extract, when added to the above, im- 
proves the value and palatability of this soup. 
A tablespoonful of hard-bread, powdered, may 
be added if rice or other grains are not avail- 
able. 

CANNED ROAST BEEF, STEW. 

Two pounds of canned roast beef. 

Six small potatoes. 

One onion. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 

Wash, peel, and slice the vegetables. Cover 
them with sufficient boiling salted water. Put 
them on to boil and when nearly done add the 
roast beef, well cut up. Season to taste with 
pepper and salt, and let the whole simmer ten 
or fifteen minutes before serving. If potatoes 
are not to be had, hard-bread, crumbed and

softened in boiling water, may "be used with 
the meat. Canned tomatoes in varying pro- 
portion make a good addition to the stew as 
already described. In the absence of any 
other vegetables they may be added to the 
meat in the proportion of pound for pound. 

CANNED ROAST BEEF, HASH. 

Two pounds of canned roast beef. 

Six boiled potatoes, small. 

One onion. 

Pepper and salt to taste. 

Chop up the meat and vegetables thor- 
oughly. Mix well. Season with pepper and 
salt and brown in a hot dish or frying pan, 
previously greased with pork or bacon, in an 
oven or over the fire. When potatoes can not 
be obtained a very good hash may be made 
by the use of softened hard-bread or boiled 
rice in their place. 

CANNED SAL.T BEEF, STEIV. 

Cut up the contents of a two-pound can. 
Cover with cold water and bring to the boil- 
ing point. Then add vegetables as directed 
for roast beef stew. Season with pepper, but 
add no salt. Stew for three quarters of -an 
hour.

Chop up the beef. Add the bacon fat or 
beef fat, and add sufficient water or soup stock 
to moisten the whole. Season with pepper 
and a very little salt. Parboil the onion, chop 
it up and add it to the mixture. Put into a 
frying pan or mess plate and brown on both 
sides. If desired, the onion may be fried 
before adding it to the hash. 

BICE PUDDING. 

Two tablespoonfuls of rice. 

One tablespoonful of sugar. 

One pint of fresh milk. 

Nutmeg or cinnamon as flavoring. 

Wash the rice and cover with the milk, 
previously sweetened and flavored. Set in a 
moderately hot oven. Stir every fifteen min- 
utes during the first hour and then once at 
the expiration of the next half hour. Let bake 
two hours and until brown top forms. This 
gives a creamy, slightly brown pudding.

son to taste with salt and pepper. 

PEA-MEAL. SOTJP. 

One-half pound of salt pork or bacon. 

One and one-half pints of water. 

Two tablespoonfuls of pea meal. 
• Take the bacon or pork and boil in the water. 
When the meat is nearly cooked add the pea- 
meal and let simmer until the meat is thor- 
oughly done. Skim off the fat, season with

TOMATO SOUP. 

To one can of tomatoes add an equal quan- 
tity of water and let simmer for half an hour. 
Mix one tablespoonfut of flour with an equal 
quantity of beef dripping or bacon fat. Add 
it to the tomatoes. Season with pepper and 
salt. If very acid a teaspoonful of sugar may 
be added to disguise the acidity. Boiled rice 
or hard-bread crumbs make a very good addi- 
tion to tomato soup. Serve hot. 

STEIVED TOMATOES WITH HAKD-BREAD. 

To each can of tomatoes add half an onion 
chopped fine, salt and pepper to taste, and, 
if tomatoes are very acid, enough sugar to 
counteract the acidity. Cover and stew for 
three- quarters of an hour. Hard-bread crumbs 
are added to thicken to the consistency desired. 

BAKED TOMATOES WITH HARD-BREAD. 

Mix enough hard-bread crumbs with the 
tomatoes to absorb the greatei* portion of the 
juice ; season with salt, pepper, and thin slices 
of bacon laid on top, and bake from three- 
quarters of an hour to an hour. Onion, either 
raw or fried, may be chopped up and added to 
the seasoning.

RBCIPES. 


The following recipes are planned to include 
such simple, digestible, appetizing, and readily 
prepared articles of diet, especially adapted to 
the needs of the sick, as may be made from 
the components of the several rations used in 
the field or on detached service, the foods in- 
cluded in the hospital stores and a few special 
articles selected for their nutritive value, ease 
of preparation, palatability, and probable avail- 
ability under ordinary circumstances. While 
the number of articles of diet which can be 
made from these food-stuffs might be consid- 
erably augmented, it is believed that the selec- 
tion made herein is sufficiently ample to meet 
the requirements of any emergency. Many 
food materials having a known value in the 
nourishment of the sick are not included in 
this list; not because their utility is unrecog- 
nized or underestimated, but through the fact 
that their special characteristics and the condi- 
tions of campaign or field service are such that 
they would probably be unattainable at the 
time when most to be desired. The Hospital

Corps man should, therefore, in his care of the 
sick, understand how to make the best use of 
such articles of food as may be confidently 
expected to be available, either wholly or in 
large part, under any conditions under which 
troops may be required to serve. 


MQUID DIET. 


STERIEIZED MILK. 

Pour the milk into a granite saucepan (or a 
double boiler) and raise temperature of milk 
to about 190° Fahrenheit. Keep it at this 
point for one hour. Do not boil the milk. 
Any utensil used for this purpose must be 
absolutely clean. 

MILK PLTN( 11. 

One cup of milk. 

Two tablespoonfuls of brandy or whisky. 

One teaspoonful of sugar. 

Grated nutmeg, to taste. 

Sweeten the milk (preferably sterilized) with 
the sugar. Stir into it the brandy. Shake it 
up well by pouring from one cup to another.

or by the use of a milk shaker, until a froth is 
formed. Grate a little nutmeg on top, and 
serve. 

The term cup” in this recipe, as in all others, 
means the tea cup, holding eight ounces. 

.MIEK WITH MIXERAE OR AERATED WATERS. 

Mix equal quantities of sterilized milk with 
seltzer, soda water, or lime water, and serve 
immediately. 

AERUMEXIZED MIEK. 

Beat up the white of an egg till light. Add 
a good-sized pinch of salt and four ounces of 
fresh, cool milk which has been sterilized. A 
little sugar may be added if desired. 

IH^PTOXTZEI) MIEK (COI.D PROCESS). 

Into a clean quart bottle put the contents 
of one peptonizing tube, mixing it with four 
ounces of cold water. Add one pint of fresh 
cold milk, shake thoroughly and place the bot- 
tle on ice. Use clean cotton to plug the bottle. 

In place of the jieptonizing powder, five 
grains of pepsin and fifteen grains of sodium 
bicarbonate, to be obtained from tlie dispen- 
sary, may be emf)loyed.

PEPTO^iTIZED MIEK (WARM PROCESS). 

Into a clean quart jar or bottle put the pow- 
der contained in one of the tubes above men- 
tioned, together with four ounces of cold water. 
Add one pint of fresh milk and shake the whole 
well. Place the bottle in a pan or kettle of 
hot water maintained at such a temperature 
that the hand can just be held in it without 
discomfort. Keep the bottle in the water for 
ten minutes. Put on the ice immediately after 
removing from the hot bath to check further 
digestion. If ice is not available, pour the

BEEF JUICE. 

Cut a lean piece of steak, from the round or 
other good portion, about one half pound in 
weight. Remove all fat and fibrous tissue. 
Broil over a clear, hot fire so that it becomes 
pink and full of juice. It should not be merely 
done on the outside and raw inside. Cut into 
small pieces and squeeze out the juice. Add a 
little salt and it is ready to serve. 

If it is needed warm, place the cup holding 
the juice in a bowl of warm water. Do not 
let the temperature of this water exceed 160° 
Fahrenheit.

leaving only the lean. Cut this up into small 
pieces. Put it into a clean glass jar, and cover 
the latter. Set the jar in a deep saucepan of 
cold water and heat gradually for one hour. 
Then strain out the juice and press the meat. 
Add a little salt, and serve. 

If the temperature of the water exceeds 160° 
Fahrenheit, the beef juice becomes brown and 
flaky. A half pound of beef should give from 
three to four tablespoonfuls of juice. 

BEEF TEA (BOTTEEB). 

Select and prepare the beef as for bottled beef 
j nice, except that to each half pound of meat a 
cup of cold water should be added, pouring 
the water over the beef after it has been put 
in the jar. The liquid thus obtained will 
resemble the beef juice in every respect except 
strength. Add a little salt and serve. 

BEEF TEA WITH ir\ J)ROCHL()RIC ACI1>. 

Select and prepare the beef as above. Put

BEE^ (OR MUTTO?^^) BROTH. 

One pound of lean beef (or mutton). 

One quart of water. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Soak the meat, previously chopped fine, in 
the cold salted water for at least two hours, in 
the vessel in which it is to be cooked, keeping 
it on ice op in a cool place during this time. 
Then expose to moderate heat. Keep the ves- 
sel covered and allow the broth to simmer, 
keeping up the original quantity of water, for 
three hours at least. Let it cool over night, 
skim off the fat in the morning, and keep cov- 
ered in a cool place until needed. Heat and 
serve as required.

garlic, carrots, celery, and parsley may also be 
used, a tablespoonful to the quart, and should 
be put in when the broth is first put on to cook. 
Strain, remove the fat and serve hot. 

CA]srXED SOUPS. 

To render canned soups ready for eating, 
simply raise them to the boiling point either 
by immersing the cans in boiling water for 
half an hour to thoroughly heat the contents, 
or by emptying and heating the same in a 
granite saucepan. After diluting with the 
proper amount of water, following directions 
on the cans, they are ready to serve. Before 
heating any canned article a hole should be 
punctured in the upper end of the can. 

GUAM BROTH (CAN?^EI)). 

This may be served hot or cold. If the 
broth is desired plain, simply heat to the tem-

be given iced ; and if fresh milk is available, 
use equal parts of milk and clam juice, heated.

POACHED EGGS. 

Pour sufficient boiling water into a clean 
cooking utensil and add salt in the proportion 
of one teaspoonful to the quart of water. Place 
it on the stove to boil. Break a fresh egg into 
a small dish and when the water boils slide 
the eggs gently into it. When the albumen or 
white is firm, or at the end of two minutes, 
lift the egg out of the water with a skimmer 
and place on a piece of hot, nicely browned 
toast or hard-tack. Sprinkle with a little salt 
and pepper and serve hot. 

SOFT COOKED EGGS. 

Put into a saucepan as many eggs as are to 
be cooked. Pour over them water enough to 
cover. The water should have been brought 
up not quite to the boiling point. Let the eggs 
stay in the water from seven to ten minutes and 
the result is an evenly cooked egg throughout. 
When the water is poured on the eggs do not 
set the pan on the stove. No further heating 
is required, but the water should not be 
allowed to cool down too rapidly.

Two eggs. 

Two tablespoonfuls of milk, cream, or water. 

One-fourth tablespoonful of salt. 

Pepper, to taste. 

Beat up the yolks and whites separately. 
Add the salt to the yolks. Mix the whites

water. Place a small piece of butter or bacon 
fat in a pan or plate hot enough to melt it. 
Pour in the omelet and with a sharp knife 
loosen the edges and fold over into a half circle. 
When done, turn out on a plate and serve hot. 
When milk can not be had water may be used. 

Spanish omelet has minced onion added to

DRY TOAST. 

Cut the bread in slices one-third of an inch 
in thickness. Toast may be made either by 
drying bread in an oven and then placing in 
toaster over lire; or the bread may be allowed 
to dry and brown in the oven. Toast that is

OATMEAE PORRIDGE. 

Three tablespoonfuls of oatmeal. 

One pint of boiling water. 

One-fourth teaspoonful of salt. 

Cook for two hours in a double boiler. 
Oatmeal is very appetizing when served cold 
in mold shapes, and it will frequently be eaten 
in this way when it would be refused if served 
in any other form. Variations may be made 
by using farina, browned rice' (browned in the 
oven before steaming and molding), arrowroot, 
etc., giving further change by serving occa- 
sionally with sweetened fruit juices, fresh, 
dried or canned, instead of cream or milk. 

Oatmeae mush . 

One cup of oatmeal. (Rolled oats.) 

Three cups of boiling water. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Pick over the oatmeal before using. Boil for 
half an hour. Coarse oatmeal requires from

The water must be boiling before putting in 
the farina. Boil for half an hour. It may be 
served with fresh milk, or condensed milk 
diluted one to four parts of boiling water, 
or with stewed dried fruit, such as prunes, 
peaches, or apples. Cold farina mush may be 
sliced and fried for the use of convalescents. 

PLAIN BOinED RICE. 

One-half cup of rice. 

Two cups of boiling water. 

One-half teaspoonful of salt. 

Pick the rice clean. Wash thoroughly in 
two waters, pouring off the last when ready to 
put the rice into the boiling water. Pour in 
the rice and boil steadily for half an hour. In 
order to see if the rice is done take out some of 
the grains and crush between the fingers. If ■ 
done it will mash easily and feel perfectly soft. 
Do not stir the rice, as this will cause it to fall ^ 
to the bottom and burn. Serve with sugar and 
fresh or condensed milk, or with stewed fruits.

MIEK PORRIDGE. 

The flour for milk porridge should be pre- 
pared in the following manner: Tie up in a 
muslin bag or a towel as much flour as desired 
and boil for four or five hours ; then bake until 
dry in an oven. To make the porridge grate 
two tablespoonfuls of the dried flour, mix it 
with cold water into a paste and add to it one 
pint of boiling milk or boiling water. Boil for 
ten minutes. If water alone is used to make 
the porridge, condensed or fresh milk may be 
used in addition, in equal parts or diluted one- 
half with water. 

Condensed milk used in this recipe is made 
' in the strength of one part of condensed milk 
to four of water. Salt is added in the propor- 
tion of one teaspoonful to the quart of boiling 
milk or water.

Soak the prunes for fifteen minutes in warn 
water^ to soften the dirt. Wash carefully' 
rejecting those that feel granular or are worm 
eaten. Stew them in the sugar and water ir 
a covered saucepan from one to two hours, or 
until tender. The fruit should be plump, soft, 
and tender to the stone. As the water evapo- 
rates restore the amount so that there will be 
as much at the end as at the beginning of the 
cooking. Add the lemon juice before taking 
off the fire. Cool, and serve. 

STEW ED DUTED APPLES, APRIC OTS, OR 
PEACHES. 

Wash the fruit thoroughly. Soak for four 
or five hours in the cold water it is to be 
cooked in, using only a sufficient quantity of 
water to cover. Heat in a covered granite-ware 
saucepan, simmering slowly for two hours. 
Do not boil. If the fruit is allowed to simmer 
it will not burn or need stirring, which breaks 
it up and makes it look unsightly. Apricots 
need plenty of sugar, but this should not be 
added until five minutes before taking off the ’ 
fire. Lemon juice or lemon peel may be added 
to poorly flavored apples, a tablespoonful of

STEWED RAW APPEES. 

Wash, pare, and core three apples (tart are 
best) ; put them into a saucepan with a cup of 
water and two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 
stew gently till they are soft, but not broken. 
A tablespoonful of lemon juice may be added 
before they are taken from the fire if the 
apples are poor in flavor. A bit of lemon peel, 
cinnamon, or cloves is also a good addition. 

Any wholesome acid fruit can be prepared 
in about the same manner. 

BAKED APPEES. 

Select fair, sound, and preferably tart apples. 
Wash and wipe them and cut out the cores, 
removing all the seeds and husks. Cut off 
any dark spots on the outside. Put the pre- 
pared apples into a granite or earthen ware 
dish. Put into each apple from one-half to 
one teaspoonful of sugar, according to the 
acidity of the fruit, and a bit of lemon peel. 
Pour boiling water into the disli about one- 
fourth inch deep and bake in a moderately

Remove from cans several hours before 
using and put in porcelain or granite-ware 
dish to cool. Canned fruit is much improved 
by cooling, being more palatable and refresh-

allow fruit to remain in cans when once 
opened. This applies particularly to very 
acid fruit, and also to meats, fish, or vege- 
tables. 

RAKED POTATOES. 

Have the potatoes of a uniform size, so that 
all may be done at the same time. W ash them 
thoroughly and bake in a hot oven from forty- 
five to fifty minutes. They are recognized as 
being done by the soft, yielding sensation given 
on pinching. 

ROASTED POTATOES. 

Bury under the hot ashes of an open fire 
(camp) for half an hour or more. Break open 
by squeezing. Brush the ashes off first.

BOILED POTATOES. 

Wash the potatoes well. Pare carefully so 
as not to waste. Put them on to cook in boiP 
ing salted water, enough to cover, and let boil 
for thirty minutes. It requires more time for 
large size potatoes. When easily pierced by 
a fork they are done. Drain off the water and 
dry them on top of the stove by moving the 
boiler back and forth for a minute or two. 
Serve as quickly as possible after they are 
cooked. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Prepare as for boiled potatoes. When cooked 
drain off the water and mash in the dish in 
which they were boiled. Add butter, pepper, 
and salt, to taste, and lastly put in a little milk 
or cream. Whip up lightly and serve imme- 
diately. Keep the dish covered until served. 

SCRAPED BEEP. 

Cut a piece of steak from the round, about 
half a pound in weight and about an inch

scraped pulp with salt and make it into small 
cakes. Broil for two minutes either by direct 
heat over a clear fire or by heating a clean pan

Have both sides cooked sufficiently. This is a 
safe way for a patient to begin taking solid 
food. Scraped beef may be prepared very 
easily over an alcohol lamp. 

BROILEB BEEF (STEAK). 

Have a clear, hot fire, either coal or char- 
coal. Put the steak on a broiler, place directly 
over the fire for about a minute, then turn 
and do same with other side. By applying 
greater heat at the outset the juices are kept 
in the meat. It requires from five to seven 
minutes over a clear fire to broil a steak an 
inch thick. Season both sides with salt and a 
little pepper, but no butter. Serve hot. A 
baked potato is a good vegetable to serve with 
the above, as is also boiled rice. 

Another good way to broil steak is to heat a 
granite- ware plate on a stove till it is quite hot. 
Place the steak on it till one side is done ; then 
turn it and do same with other side.

sugar and sherry or brandy. Beat up quickly 
and pour into a bowl or mold to cool. Arrow- 
root blanc-mange may be made with fresh hot 
milk or condensed milk diluted. If boiling 
water is used it causes the starch of the arrow- 
root, when first poured in, to form into lumps. 
Hence it is best to have the water not quite at 
boiling point.

HARD-BREAD GRDEE. 

Foiirtablespoonfulsof powdered hard-bread. 

One pint of boiling water. 

One-half teaspoonfnl of salt. 

Prepare in the same manner as the hard- 
bread toast water. 

HARD-BREAD MIJSH OR PORRIDGE. 

One cnp of powdered hard-bread. 

Pour cups of boiling water. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Mix and boil for twenty minutes. The mush 
may be eaten with condensed milk or stewed

bread. 

HARD-BREAD AS MIEK TOAST. 

Toast two or three pieces of hard-bread to a 
good brown color by placing in an oven or 
over clear fire on a toaster. When done pour

HARD-BREAD A>D DRIED APPEES (BROWN 
BETTY). 

Soak the dried apples for at least four hours. 
Grease a baking j)an or dish and place in it 
first a layer of sliced apples, then a layer of 
hard-bread crumbs, or whole hard-bread soft- 
ened in boiling water for ten minutes, with 
small quantities of butter or fat pork and 
sugar, and ground cinnamon sprinkled over 
each layer. Continue till the dish is full, hav- 
ing bread crumbs for the top layer. Moisten 
with a cup of water, or fresh or diluted con- 
densed milk, and bake for three-quarters of an 
hour in a moderately heated oven. When a 
fork easily pierces the apples the pudding is 
cooked. It can be eaten hot or cold with but- 
ter and sugar creamed together and flavored 
with cinnamon or nutmeg; with a simple sirup 
of sugar and water, or with the following 
sauce : 

SAUCE FOR HARD-BREAD PUDDING . 

One pint of boiling water. 

One tablespoonful of flour. 

One-half cup of sugar. 

One lemon. 

To the water add the flour, mixed into a paste 
with three tablespoonfuls of cold water. Boil

for ten minutes. Add the sugar and lemon 
juice, strained; or other flavoring to taste. 

BACON, BROIEED. 

Wash in cold water. Cut in thin slices and 
broil over clear coals either on a broiler or with 
a fork over a charcoal fire. Serve immediately. 

BACON, ERIEO. 

Cut in thin slices after washing, roll in hard- 
bread crnmbs and fry in a very hot pan which 
has been greased. Season with pepper and 
serve immediately. The bacon may be fried 
without the bread crumbs, if preferred. 

BACON, BOIEEB. 

Wash the bacon in cold water. Scrape and 
trim off any rusty or brownish spots, and if 
very hard or dry, soak for a few hours in cold 
water. Put it on to cook in enough cold water 
to cover it well, let it come slowly to a boil 
and then boil steadily until done. As the 
water evaporates or boils away replenish it 
with more boiling water. When the bacon 
can be easily pierced with a fork in the thickest 
part it is done. Save the fat, it will be useful 
in frying; and if greens are to be cooked leave 
enough in the water to season them.

CANNED ROAST BEEF, SODP. 

One pound (one-half can) of roast beef. 

One pint of cold water. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 

Cut the beef into small pieces and add it to 
the cold water. Let it come to a boil and then 
simmer gently for half an hour. Skim off the 
fat and strain, taking care to express all the 
meat juice and gelatine from the meat. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper to taste. A little 
beef extract, when added to the above, im- 
proves the value and palatability of this soup. 
A tablespoonful of hard-bread, powdered, may 
be added if rice or other grains are not avail- 
able. 

CANNED ROxIlST BEEF, STEW. 

Two pounds of canned roast beef. 

Six small potatoes. 

One onion. 

Salt and pepper to taste. 

Wash, peel, and slice the vegetables. Cover 
them with sufficient boiling salted water. Put 
them on to boil and when nearly done add the 
roast beef, well cut up. Season to taste with 
pej^per and salt, and let the whole simmer ten 
or fifteen minutes before serving. If potatoes 
are not to be had, hard-bread, crumbed and

RECIPES. 


softened in boiling water, may be used with 
the meat. Canned tomatoes in varying pro- 
portion make a good addition to the stew as 
already described. In the absence of any 
other vegetables they may be added to the 
meat in the proportion of pound for pound. 

CA^^^]N^ED ROAST BEEF, HASH. 

Two pounds of canned roast beef. 

Six boiled potatoes, small. 

One onion. 

Pepper and salt to taste. 

Chop up the meat and vegetables thor- 
oughly. Mix well. Season with pepper and 
salt and brown in a hot dish or frying pan, 
previously greased with pork or bacon, in an 
oven or over the fire. When potatoes can not 
be obtained a very good hash may be made 
by the use of softened hard-bread or boiled 
rice in their place. 

CANJ^ED SAET BEEF, STEW. 

Cut up the contents of a two-pound can. 
Cover with cold water and bring to the boil- 
ing point. Then add vegetables as directed 
for roast beef stew. Season with pepper, but 
add no salt. Stew for three quarters of an 
hour.

CAXXED SALT BEEF, HASH. 

Two pounds (one can) of salt beef. 

One cup of bard-bread crumbs. 

One onion. 

Bacon fat or beef fat (about the size of an 

egg). 

Water, or soup stock. 

Pepper and salt. 

Chop up the beef. Add the bucon fat or 
beef fat, and add sufficient water or soup stock 
to moisten the whole. Season with pepper 
and a very little salt. Parboil the onion, chop 
it up and add it to the mixture. Put into a 
frying pan or mess plate and brown on both 
sides. If desired, the onion may be fried 
before adding it to the hash. 

rice pudding. 

Two tablespoonfuls of rice. 

One tablespoonful of sugar. 

One pint of fresh milk. 

Nutmeg or cinnamon as flavoring. 

Wash the rice and cover with the milk, 
previously sweetened and flavored. Set in a 
moderately hot oven. Stir every fifteen min- 
utes during the first hour and then once at 
the expiration of the next half hour . Let bake 
two hours and until brown top forms. This 
gives a creamy, slightly brown pudding.

RECIPES. 


BAKED BEAK SOUP. 

Take cold baked beans, add twice as mucli 
water as beans, and let them simmer till soft. 
When done add half as much canned tomatoes 
and strain. If too thick add more water. Sea- 
son to taste with salt and pepper. 

PEA-MEAD SOUP. 

One-half pound of salt pork or bacon. 

One and one-half pints of water. 

Two tablespoonfuls of pea meal. 

Take the bacon or pork and boil in the water. 
When the meat is nearly cooked add the pea- 
meal and let simmer until the meat is thor- 
oughly done. Skim off the fat, season with 
pepper and serve. Canned salt meat can also 
be used to make pea soup, but does not re- 
quire so long to prepare, as the meat is already 
cooked. Season with pepper and very little 
salt. Serve hot. 

PRIED PEA-MEAD MD^SH. 

One pint of water. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Four tablespoonfuls of pea meal. 

Add the pea-meal to the salted water. Boil 
for twenty minutes. Cool by pouring out in

TOMATO SOUP. 

To one can of tomatoes add an equal quan- 
tity of water and let simmer for half an hour. 
Mix one tahlespoonful of flour with an equal 
quantity of heef dripping or bacon fat. Add 
it to the tomatoes. Season with pepper and 
salt. If very acid a teaspoonful of sugar may 
he added to disguise the acidity. Boiled rice 
or hard-hread crumbs make a very good addi- 
tion to tomato soup. Serve hot. 

STEWED TOMATOES WITH HARD-BREAD. 

To each can of tomatoes add half an onion 
chopped flne, salt and pepper to taste, and, 
if tomatoes are very acid, enough sugar to 
counteract the acidity. Cover and stew for 
three- quarters of an hour. Hard-bread crumbs 
are added to thicken to the consistency desired. 

BAKED TOMATOES WITH HARD-BI?EAD. 

Mix enough hard-bread crumbs with the 
tomatoes to absorb the greater portion of the 

i’ juice; season with salt, pepper, and thin slices 

of bacon laid on top, and bake from thiee- 
quarters of an hour to an hour. Onion, either 
raw or fried, may be chopped up and added to 
the seasoning.

RECIPES. 



The following recipes are planned to include 
such simple, digestible, appetizing, and readily 
prepared articles of diet, especially adapted to 
the needs of the sick, as may be made from 
the components of the several rations used in 
the field or on detached service, the foods in- 
cluded in the hospital stores and a few special 
articles selected for their nutritive value, ease 
of preparation, palatability, and probable avail- 
ability under ordinary circumstances. While 
the number of articles of diet which can be 
made from these food-stuffs might l)e consid- 
erably augmented, it is believed that the selec- 
tion made herein is sufficiently ample to meet 
the requirements of any emergency. Many 
food materials having a known value in the 
nourishment of the sick are not included in 
this list; not because their utility is unrecog- 
nized or underestimated, but through the fact 
that their special characteristics and the condi- 
tions of campaign or field service are such that 
they would probably be unattainable at the 
time when most to be desired. The Hospital

such articles of food as may be confidently 
expected to be available, either Avholly or in 
large part, under any conditions under which 
troops may be required to serve.

ing witb egg shells, or, in their absence, by a 
dash of cold water. Add sugar and milk to 
flavor as desired. 

TEA. 

To each half pint of boiling water add one 
teaspoonful of tea. Let it steep or infuse for 
five minutes. Never let tea boil. Add sugar 
and milk to flavor as desired. 

BEEF JUICE. 

Cut a lean piece of steak, from the round or 
other good portion, about one half pound in 
weight. Remove all fat and fibrous tissue. 
Broil over a clear, hot fire so that it becomes 
pink and full of jtiice. It should not be merely 
done on the outside and raw inside. Cut into 
small pieces and squeeze out the juice. Add a 
little salt and it is ready to serve. 

If it is needed warm, place the cup holding 
the juice in a bowl of warm water. Do not 
let the temperature of tliis water exceed 160° 
Fahrenheit. 

BEEF JUICE (BOTTEED). 

Choose a good, well-flavored i)iece of beef, 
half a pound in weight. Cut away the fat,

leaving only the lean. Cut this up into small 
pieces. Put it into a clean glass jar, and cover 
the latter. Set the jar in a deep saucepan of 
cold water and heat gradually for one hour. 
Then strain out the juice and press the meat. 
Add a little salt, and serve. 

If the temperature of the water exceeds 160° 
Fahrenheit, the beef juice becomes brown and 
flaky. A half pound of beef should give from 
three to four tablespoonfuls of juice. 

BEEF TEA (BOTTLED). 

Select and prepare the beef as for bottled beef 
juice, except that to each half pound of meat a 
cup of cold water should be added, ijouriug 
the water over the beef after it has been put 
in the jar. The liquid thus obtained will 
resemble the beef juice in every respect except 
strength. Add a little salt and serve. 

BEEF TEA AVITH HYDROCHLORIC ACID. 

Select and prepare the beef as above. Put 
in a bowl and pour over it one cupful of cold 
water, to which five drops of dilute hydro- 
chloric acid have been added. Let the whole 
stand for two hours in a cool place. Strain, add 
salt to fiavor, and serve cold. This tea may be 
heated, but the albumen which coagulates and

appears as brown flakes slioiilcl not be strained 
out, for it is the nutritions jDortion of the tea. 

BEEF (OR MUTTOX) BROTH. 

One pound of lean beef (or mutton). 

One quart of water. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Soak the meat, previously chopped fine, in 
the cold salted water for at least two hours, in 
the vessel in which it is to be cooked, keeping 
it on ice or in a cool place during this time. 
Then expose to moderate heat. Keep the ves- 
sel covered and allow the broth to simmer, 
keeping up the original quantity of water, for 
three hours at least. Let it cool over night, 
skim off the fat in the morning, and keep cov- 
ered in a cool place until needed. Heat and 
serve as required. 

CIIICKEX BROTH. 

Fowls are better to use for broth than young- 
chickens. Pluck and prepare by singeing with 
a blazing newspaper, straw, or dry grass. Re- 
move all refuse — entrails, oil-bag, crop), lungs, 
etc. Wash well in cold, water; then cut up 
and disjoint. Put one pound of chicken into 
a quart of cold salted water and simmer for 
two hours ; then boil for two hours. Add rice

or powdered hard-bread or soft bread crumbs 
in the proportion of one tablespoonful to each, 
quart of water. Vegetables, such as onions, 
garlic, carrots, celery, and parsley may also be 
used, a tablespoonful to the quart, and should 
be put in -when the broth is first iDut on to cook. 
Strain, remove the fat and serve hot. 

CANNED 80n*S. 

To render canned soups ready for eating, 
simply raise them to the boiling point either 
b}^ immersing the cans in boiling water for 
half an hour to thoroughly heat the contents, 
or by emptying and heating the same in a 
granite saucepan. After diluting with the 
proper amount of water, following directions 
on the cans, they are ready to serve. Before 
heating any canned article a hole should be 
punctured in the upper end of the can. 

CXAM BROTH (CAXXEDj. 

This may be served hot or cold. If the 
broth is desired plain, simply heat to the tem- 
perature required. Do not boil. It can also 
be given iced ; and if fresh milk is available, 
use equal parts of milk and clam juice, heated.

POACHED EGGS. 

Pour sufficient boiling water into a clean 
cooking utensil and add salt in the proportion 
of one teaspoonful to the quart of water. Place 
it on the stove to boil. Break a fresh egg into 
a small dish and when the water boils slide 
the eggs gently into it. When the albumen or 
white is firm, or at the end of two minutes, 
lift the egg out of the water with a skimmer 
and place on a piece of hot, nicely browned 
toast or hard-tack. Sprinkle with a little salt 
and pepper and serve hot. 

SOFT COOKED EGGS. 

Put into a saucepan as many eggs as are to 
be cooked. Pour over them water enough to 
cover. The water should have been brought 
up not quite to the boiling point. Let the eggs 
stay in the water from seven to ten minutes and 
the result is an evenly cooked egg throughout. 
When the water is poured on the eggs do not 
set the pan on the stove. 'No further heating- 
is required, but the water should not be 
allowed to cool down too rapidly.

BOILED EGGS. 



Carefully i^ut into boiling water as many 
eggs as are to be cooked. For soft boiled 
eggs leave in three minutes and then at once 
remove. For hard boiled eggs boil from seven 
to ten minutes. 

OMELET. 

Two eggs. 

Two tablespoonfuls of milk, cream, or water. 

One-fourth tablespoonful of salt. 

Pepper, to taste. 

Beat up the yolks and whites separately. 
Add the salt to the yolks. Mix the whites 
and yolks together with the milk, cream, or 
water. Place a small piece of butter or bacon 
fat in a pan or i^late hot enough to melt it. 
Pour in the omelet and with a sharp knife 
loosen the edges and fold over into a half circle. 
When done, turn out on a plate and serve hot. 
When milk can not be had water may be used. 

Spanish omelet has minced onion added to 
the above. An excellent addition to the plain 
omelet is a dressing made of canned tomatoes 
and boiled crumbled hard-bread, strained, sea- 
soned, and heated together. Never use flour 
in an omelet, as it can not be cooked sufiiciently 
in the short time that should be given to eggs.

BAKED CUSTARD. 

One pint of fresh milk. 

Two eggs. 

One-tMrd teaspoonful of salt. 

Two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

Small piece of cinnamon. 

Put tlie cinnamon in the milk and pour into 
a saucepan to heat. Break the eggs into a bowl 
with the sugar and salt and beat until well 
mixed but not liglit. When the milk comes 
to a boil pour it over the eggs. Stir slowly 
to dissolve the sugar. Strain the mixture into 
cups, set them in a deep pan of boiling water 
and bake for twenty minutes in a moderately 
hot oven. 

DUY TOAST. 

Cut the bread in slices one-third of an inch 
in thickness. Toast may be made either by 
drying bread in an oven and then ]3lacing in 
toaster over lire ; or the bread may be allowed 
to dry and brown in the oven. Toast that is 
moist and soft in the middle should never be 
given an invalid. Have it dry, crisp through- 
out, and of a golden brown in color. Serve 
hot, either dry or buttered. 

MILK TOAST. 

Put a cup of milk into a saucepan and let it 
heat to the boiling point. Have ready three 



RECIPES. 25 

slices of nicely browned toast. Put a little salt 
in the milk and pour it over the toast. A little 
butter may be spread on the latter, but it is a 
more delicate dish without it. Serve hot. 

OATMEAL PORRIDGE. 

Three tablespoonfuls of oatmeal. 

One pint of boiling water. 

One-fourth teaspoonful of salt. 

Cook for two hours in a double boiler. 
Oatmeal is very appetizing when served cold 
in mold shapes, and it will frequently be eaten 
in this way when it would be refused if served 
in any other form. Variations may be made 
by using farina, browned rice (browned in the 
oven before steaming and molding), arrowroot, 
etc., giving further change by serving occa- 
sionally with sweetened fruit juices, fresh, 
dried or canned, instead of cream or milk. 

OATMEAE MESH. 

One cup of oatmeal. (Rolled oats.) 

Three cups of boiling water. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Pick over the oatmeal before using. Boil for 
half an hour. Coarse oatmeal requires from 
two to three hours cooking. Salt should be 
added to the water before the oatmeal is jDut in.

FARIXA MI SH OR PORRIDGE. 

Three tablespoonfuls of farina. 

One pint of boiling water. 

One-lialf teaspoonful of salt. 

The water must be boiling before iDutting in 
the farina. Boil for half an hour. It may be 
served with fresh milk, or condensed milk 
diluted one to four parts of boiling water, 
or with stewed dried fruit, such as prunes, 
peaches, or apples. Cold farina mush may be 
sliced and fried for the use of convalescents. 

PLAIX BOILED RICE. 

One-half cup of rice. 

Two cups of boiling water. 

One-half teaspoonful of salt. 

Pick the rice clean. Wash thoroughly in 
two waters, pouring off the last when ready to 
put the rice into the boiling water. Pour in 
the rice and boil steadily for half an hour. In 
order to see if the rice is done take out some of 
the grains and crush between the fingers. If 
done it will mash easily and feel perfectly soft. 
Do not stir the rice, as this will cause it to fall 
to the bottom and burn. Serve with sugar and 
fresh or condensed milk, or with stewed fruits. 



RECIPES. 27 

STEAMED RICE. 

Wash the rice thoroughly in two waters. 
Use in same proportions as are given for boiled 
rice. Use a double boiler. Have the water 
boiling in lower boiler. Place the above mix- 
ture o#rice, boiling water, and salt in the ui^per 
chamber and let cook for one hour. Do not stir. 
Keep the rice covered while steaming, and keep 
the lower boiler well supplied with boiling 
water. Serve as with boiled rice. 

MILK PORRIDGE. 

The flour for milk porridge should be -pve- 
pared in the following manner: Tie ujj in a 
muslin bag or a towel as much flour as desired 
and boil for four or five hours ; then bake until 
dry in an oven. To make the porridge grate 
two tablespoonfuls of the dried flour, mix it 
with cold water into a paste and add to it one 
pint of boiling milk or boiling water. Boil for 
ten minutes. If water alone is used to make 
the porridge, condensed or fresh milk may be 
used in addition, in equal parts or diluted one- 
half with water. 

Condensed milk used in this recipe is made 
in the strength of one part of condensed milk 
to four of water. Salt is added in the propor- 
tion of one teaspoonful to the quart of boiling 
milk or water.

LEMOX JELLY. 

Oiie-fourtli box of gelatine. 

Oue-fourtb. cup of cold water. 

One-fourth cup of fresh lemon juice (about 
the amount yielded by two lemons). 

Three tablespoonfuls of sugar. • 

One and one-fourth cups of boiling water. 

Put the gelatine to soak in the cold water, 
about twenty minutes being required for this 
process. When dissolved pour on the boiling 
water. Add the lemon juice and sugar. Stir 
thoroughly and strain through a fine-meshed 
cloth into a china or granite- ware mold, cool- 
ing in a refrigerator or by placing in a pan of 
cold water. Xever use tin molds for lemon 
jelly.

One-fourth cup of cold water. 

One cup of boiling water. 

One-half cup of strong coffee. 

Two tablespoonfuls of sugar. 

Soak the gelatine in the cold water for half 
an hour. Pour on the boiling water, then put 
in the sugar and coffee. Strain it through a 
.cloth into a mold or dish in which it may be 
cooled, either in a pan of iced water or in a

refrigerator. Coffee jelly may be served with 
cream and sugar. 

Have the coffee strong, two tablespoonfuls 
of coffee to each cup of water. Where vanilla 
extract is available, one-half teaspoonfnl will 
be advantageously added to the above recipe. 

AVIXE JELLY. 

One-fourth box of gelatine. 

One-fourth cup of cold water. 

One-half cup of sugar. 

One-half cup of sherry wine. 

One and one-fourth cups of boiling water. 

One small piece of cinnamon. 

Put the gelatine and cold water together in 
a dish large enough to hold the whole mixture. 
Let it soak for half an hour; then pour the 
boiling water (in which the piece of cinnamon 
has been simmering) over the softened gela- 
tine. Add the sugar and wine, strain through 
a clean cloth into a china or granite-ware 
mold, and cool it in a refrigerator or a pan of 
cold water. 

STEAVED PRUXES. 

One pint of prunes. 
One and one-half pints of water. 
One-fourth cup of sugar. 
Juice of one lemon. 



30 RECIPES. 

Soak the prunes for fifteen minutes in warm 
water to soften the dirt. Wash carefully, 
rejecting those that feel granular or are worm- 
eaten. Stew them in the sugar and water in 
a covered saucepan from one to two hours, or 
until tender. The fruit should be plump, soft, 
and tender to the stone. As the water evapo- 
rates restore the amount so that there will be 
as much at the end as at the beginning of the 
cooking. Add the lemon juice before taking 
off the hre. Cool, and serve. 

STEAVED DHTEB APPEE8, APRICOTS, OR 
PEACHES. 

Wash the fruit thoroughly. Soak for four 
or five hours in the cold water it is to be 
cooked in, using only a sufficient quantity of 
water to cover. Heat in a covered granite-ware 
saucepan, simmering slowly for two hours. 
Do not boil. If the fruit is allowed to simmer 
it will not burn or need stirring, which breaks 
it up and makes it look unsightly. Apricots 
need plenty of sugar, but this should not be 
added until five minutes before taking off the 
fire. Lemon juice or lemon peel may be added 
to poorly flavored apples, a tablespoonful of 
the juice or the peel of half a lemon to the 



RECIPES. 31 

IDOimd of fruit ; or spices may be used for fla- 
voring. The use of brown sugar is to be pre- 
ferred for this purpose because of the better 
flavor which it gives. 

STEWED RA^V APPLES. 

Wash, pare, and core three apples (tart are 
best) ; put them into a saucepan with a cup of 
water and two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and 
stew gently till they are soft, but not broken. 
A tablespoonful of lemon juice may be added 
before they are taken from the fire if the 
apples are poor in flavor. A bit of lemon peel, 
cinnamon, or cloves is also a good addition. 

Any wholesome acid fruit can be prepared 
in about the same manner. 

BAKED APPLES. 

Select fair, sound, and preferably tart apples. 
Wash and wipe them and cut out the cores, 
removing all the seeds and husks. Cut off 
any dark spots on the outside. Put the pre- 
pared apples into a granite or earthen ware 
dish. Put into each apple from one-half to 
one teaspoonful of sugar, according to the 
acidity of the fruit, and a bit of lemon peel. 
Pour boiling water into the dish about one- 
fourth inch deep and bake in a moderately

liot oven. When perfectly soft all through 
the fruit is done. The time for baking varies, 
according to the species of apple, from half an 
hour to two hours. 

CAXXED FRUIT, SERVIXG OF. 

Remove from cans several hours before 
using and put in porcelain or granite-ware 
dish to cool. Canned fruit is much improved 
by cooling, being more palatable and refresh- 
ing than if served direct from the can. Never 
allow fruit to remain in cans when once 
opened. This applies particularly to very 
acid fruit, and also to meats, fish, or vege- 
tables. 

BAKE1» POTATOES. 

Have the j)otatoes of a uniform size, so that 
all may be done at the same time. Wash them 
thoroughly and bake in a hot oven from forty- 
five to fifty minutes. They are recognized as 
being done by the soft, yielding sensation given 
on pinching. 

ROASTED POTATOES. 

Bury under the hot ashes of an open fire 
(camp) for half an hour or more. Break open 
by squeezing. Brush the ashes off first. 



RECIPES. 33 

BOILED POTATOES. 

Wash tlie potatoes well. Pare carefully so 
as not to waste. Put them on to cook in boil- 
ing salted water, enough to cover, and let boil 
for thirty minutes. It requires more time for 
large size potatoes. When easily pierced by 
a fork they are done. Drain off the water and 
dry them on top of the stove by moving the 
boiler back and forth for a minute or two. 
Serve as quickly as possible after they are 
cooked. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

Prepare as for boiled potatoes. When cooked 
drain off the water and mash in the dish in 
which they were boiled. Add butter, pepper, 
and salt, to taste, and lastly put in a little milk 
or cream. Whip up lightly and serve imme- 
diately. Keep the dish covered until served. 

SCRAPED BEEF. 

Cut a piece of steak from the round, about 
half a pound in weight and about an inch 
thick. Lay it on a clean meat board and with 
a sharp knife scrajje off' the pulp until there 
is nothing left but stringy fiber. Season the 
scraped pulp with salt and make it into small 
cakes. Broil for two minutes either by direct 
heat over a clear fire or by heating a clean pan

or plate and, when liot, placing the meat on it. 
Have both sides cooked sufficiently. This is a 
safe way for a patient to begin taking solid 
food. Scraped beef may be prepared very 
easily over an alcohol lamp. 

BROILED BEEF (STEAK). 

Have a clear, hot fire, either coal or char- 
coal. Put the steak on a broiler, place directly 
over the fire for about a minute, then turn 
and do same with other side. By apiDlying 
greater heat at the outset the juices are kept 
in the meat. It requires from five to seven 
minutes over a clear fire to broil a steak an 
inch thick. Season both sides with salt and a 
little pepper, but no butter. Serve hot. A 
baked potato is a good vegetable to serve with 
the above, as is also boiled rice. 

Another good way to broil steak is to heat a 
granite- ware plate on a stove till it is quite hot. 
Place the steak on it till one side is done; then 
turn it and do same with other side.

it to the chicken. Let it stew for ten minutes, 
and serve with toast or boiled rice. 

MINCED ( HICKEX OX TOAST. 

Prepare the chicken as for broth. When 
cool, skim off the fat and cut up the meat fine, 
rejecting all skin, tendons, gristle, and bone. 
Season with salt and a little pepper. Add 
enough broth, or, better yet, cream, if avail- 
able, to make it of the proper consistency, or 
about that of cream. Have ready some nicely- 
browned dry toast, pour the minced chicken 
over it, and serve hot.

MALTED MILK. 

Mix one or two tablespoonfuls of malted 
milk with a like quantity of warm, boiled 
water. Add more water to make up half a 
pint. Season with salt to taste. 

Boiling water can not be used to advantage 
in making up this preparation. 

CHOCOLATE. 

Grate one ounce of chocolate. Have ready 
one pint of boiling milk. Mix the grated choco- 
late with some hot milk into a paste, add it to 
the boiling milk and boil five or six min- 
utes. Flavor with sugar, one teaspoonful to 
the pint. If fresh milk is not available, make 
the chocolate with boiling water and add one 
teaspoonful of condensed milk to each half pint 
of chocolate. 

ARROAVROOT BLAXC-MAISTGE. 

Two tablespoonfuls of arrowroot. 
Two-thirds pint of hot water. 
Two tablespoonfuls of sherry or brandy. 
Two teaspoonful s of sugar. 



RECIPES. 37 

Mix the arrowroot into a smooth, paste with 
three tablespoonfuls of cold water. Add this 
to the hot water. Bring to a boil, stirring 
constantly till well blended and free from 
lumps. Let boil for ten minutes. Add the 
sugar and sherry or brandy. Beat up quickly 
and pour into a bowl or mold to cool. Arrow- 
root blanc-mange may be made with fresh hot 
milk or condensed milk diluted. If boiling- 
water is used it causes the starch of the arrow- 
root, when first poured in, to form into lumps. 
Hence it is best to have the water not quite at 
boiling point.

One cnj) of powdered hard-bread. 

Four cups of boiling water. 

One teaspoonful of salt. 

Mix and boil for twenty minutes. The mush 
may be eaten with condensed milk or stewed 
dried fruit. 

Care should be taken to prevent scorching 
by frequent stirring; and the watei should be 
boiling in all cases before adding the j)owdered 
bread. 

HARD-BREAD AS MILK TOAST, 

Toast two or three pieces of hard-bread to a 
good brown color by placing in an oven or 
over clear fire on a toaster. When done pour 
enough boiling water over them to soften 
thoroughly. Dilute two tables j)oonfuls of 
condensed milk in four times as much boiling 
water. Drain off the water from the toasted 
bread and pour on the milk. Serve hot.

hard-bread crumbs, or whole hard-bread soft- 
ened in boiling water for ten minutes, with 
small quantities of butter or fat pork and 
sugar, and ground cinnamon sprinkled over 
each layer. Continue till the dish is full, hav- 
ing bread crumbs for the top layer. Moisten 
with a cup of water, or fresh or diluted con- 
densed milk, and bake for three-quarters of an 
hour in a moderately heated oven. When a 
fork easily pierces the apples the pudding is 
cooked. It can be eaten hot or cold with but- 
ter and sugar creamed together and flavored 
with cinnamon or nutmeg; with a simple sirup 
of sugar and water, or with the following

broil over clear coals either on a broiler or with 
a fork over a charcoal fire. Serve immediately. 

BACON, FRIED. 

Cut in thin slices after washing, roll in hard- 
bread crumbs and fry in a very hot pan which 
has been greased. Season with pepper and 
serve immediately. Tlie bacon may be fried 
without the bread crumbs, if preferred. 

BACON, BOIT.EI>. 

Wash the bacon in cold water. Scrape and 
trim off any rusty or brownish spots, and if 
very hard or dry, soak for a few hours in cold 
water. Put it on to cook in enough cold water 
to cover it well, let it come slowly to a boil 
and then boil steadily until done. As the 
water evaporates or boils away replenish it 
with more boiling water. When the bacon 
can be easily pierced with a fork in the thickest 
part it is done. Save the fat, it will be useful 
in frying; and if greens are to be cooked leave 
enough in the water to season them.
