WARNING 

The making of bread is, to a large degree, a chemical operation, and should 
be carried on with as much accuracy as a chemist would use in his laboratory. 
The flour should be weighed or measured. The other ingredients should also 
be weighed or measured accurately. 

Temperature is a particularly important factor in making good bread. Do 
not let sponge or dough get chilled. 

When potatoes are used, be sure that they are sound, white and mealy, and 
in the fall, when the new crop is on the market, be careful that the potatoes 
are fully ripe. More failures in bread making are due to the use of potatoes 
which are thought to be ripe, but which are not fully matured, than any other 
one thing. 

In making cake, a difference may be noted if the eggs are large or small, if 
small use either more eggs or more water or milk. 

RECIPE FOR BREAD 
(University of Nevada Method)

2 cups milk, scalded, yeast in % cup luke warm

with wooden spoon until very light. Let stand. 

Add Gold Medal flour and knead until smooth, brush butter over top of 
dough, cover and let raise to twice original size. 
Mould into loaves and let raise twenty minutes. 

Put in very hot over for ten minutes, then bake in slow oven forty-five 
minutes.

SOUR MILK DOUGHNUTS 

2 eggs, beaten light, 1 cup sour milk, 

3 even tablespoonfuls melted but- % teaspoonful soda, 

ter, 1 saltspoonful each of cinnamon 

4 cups Gold Medal Flour, and salt. 

1 cup sugar, 

Enough more Gold Medal Flour to make just soft enough to roll out. Mix 
the dough rather soft at first. Have the board well floured, and the fat heating. 
Boll only a large spoonful at first. Cut into rings with an open cutter. Mix 
the trimmings with another spoonful. Work it lightly till well floured and 
roll again. Eoll and cut all out before frying. The fat should be hot enough 
for the dough to rise to the top instantly. 

DOUGHNUTS AND CRULLERS 

The fat should be in a deep pot (to obviate any danger of boiling over), 
and should be of sufficient depth to cover the dough, when first dropped in. 
It should be smoking hot, or the dough will absorb grease and be soggy. Not 
more than half a dozen should be dropped .in at any one time, or the fat will 
be unduly cooled and some of the cakes submerged during the entire cooking; 
in which case the cakes when cooked will be greasy and not light. One or two 
pieces of dough should be cooked first as testers. When done the cakes should 
be drained on unglazed paper, then rolled in powdered sugar. 

ALMOND COOKIES

for the reason that there is no rule you can work by that will answer in all 
cases. All molasses does not work alike; some kinds will bear more water 
than others, and the weather has to be taken into consideration. In cold 
weather you can use more water than in warm weather. Sometimes you can 
use the same quantity of water as molasses. Be very careful and not get the 
dough too stiff, and do not work any mor than is necessary to mix.

PUDDINGS 



PEACH COBBLER, SOUTHERN STYLE 

A large pie baked in shallow baking tins from one to one and a half inches 
in depth with bottom and top crust, glazed and sugared on top, and cut out 
in squares or triangular pieces. 

Fine puff paste is too rich for this purpose; ordinary flaky pie crust made 
with ten or twelve ounces of butter, to a pound of Gold Medal Flour, is best; 
cover the bottom of the pan with a sheet of paste rolled quite thin, fill with 
ripe peeled peaches, strew over them half their weight of sugar, and a little 
nutmg; cover with another thin sheet of paste, and bake about three-quarters 
of an hour; when half done brush over the top with egg and water and strew 
granulated sugar over; put back and bake to a rich color; when the fruit is 
too dry to make its own syrup, make a sauce to go with the cobbler; all sorts 
of fruit or rhubarb can be used this way; canned fruit should be stewed down 
till the juice becomes thick before being put in the paste lined tins. 

BAKED CUSTARD 

3 yolks, 11-3 cups sugar, 

1 egg, Pinch of salt. 

1 pint milk, 

Bake until firm in center. 

When you want carmel custard, then take 2-3 cup of granulated sugar, melt 
the sugar until it turns a light brown then add it to the boiling milk.

PIES 



BANANA RAISIN PIE 

Cook 1/2 cup chopped seeded raisins in 1 cup water until plump. Take from 
fire, add 2 tablespoonfuls sifted cracker crumbs mixed with 1 tablespoonful 
flour and 1 teaspoonful butter. Let stand covered until cold. Cut 1 large 
banana in thin slices, add % teaspoonful cinnamon, 2 tablespoonfuls lemon 
juice, 3 tablespoonfuls sugar, % teaspoonful lemon extract and grated rind % 
lemon. Combine mixture, add 1 well-beaten egg and 2 tablespoonfuls seeded 
raisins cut in pieces. Bake between two crusts. 

LEMON PIE 

One small teacup of boiling water, put in juice and rind of one lemon, one 
teaspoonful of corn starch to thicken; then add four egg yolks, one cup of 
sugar, mixed together; beat the whites of two eggs stiff and put in with egg 
yolks and sugar. After custard is done put on top the whites of the other 
two eggs, put in oven and brown. Bake pie crust first. 

APPLE PIE 

Stew green or ripe apples, when you have pared and cored them. Mash to 
a smooth compote, sweeten to taste, and while hot, stir in a teaspoon butter 
for each pie. Season with nutmeg. When cool, fill your crust, and either cross- 
bar the top with strips of paste, or make without cover. Eat cold, with 
powdered sugar strewed over it. 

PUMPKIN PIE 

The following measure will make three good sized pies: Put into your 
mixing dish one quart and a pint of stewed and strained pumpkin, about one- 
quarter pound sugar, half cup molasses, half a tablespoonful each ginger, nut- 
meg, a scant teaspoonful each of cinnamon and salt, one-quarter cup melted 
butter and one quart of milk. Beat six eggs and add to the mixture, and stir

side skin, then cut in pieces one-half inch long; line a pie dish with paste, put 
a layer of the rhubarb nearly an inch deep, a large teacup of sugar, sprinkle 
with salt, shake over a little Gold Medal Flour, cover with a crust, slit in the 
center, trim off the edge and bake in a quick oven until done. Rhubarb pies 
made in this way are superior to those made of the fruit stewed. 

LEMON CUSTARD PIE 

Make a good pie crust and prick bottom. Put one cup sugar and one cup

PRUNE PIE 

Stew, stone and mash enough prunes to make a cupful of pulp. Add a cup 
cream, yolks of three eggs, beaten, flavor with vanilla, add pinch of salt; bake 
in a rich under-crust as quickly as possible; beat the whites of the eggs with 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar, spread over top, return to oven and brown very 
highly. 

MINCE MEAT 

The following is an excellent recipe for mince meat and it will fill twelve to 
fourteen quart jars. Chop fine six pounds of cooked beef and mix with two 
pounds of chopped suet; add twelve pounds of chopped apples, five pounds of 
raisins, three and a half pounds currants, one pound of citron and two pounds 
of brown sugar; mix thoroughly and then add seven cups of molasses, two 
tablespoonfuls of cinnamon, three of nutmeg, two quarts of sweet cider, one 
quart of boiled cider, three cups of sherry wine and one pint of brandy. Cook 
twenty minutes, stirring frequently. 

MOLASSES PIE 

Four eggs, one cup sugar, two cups molasses. Boil sugar and molasses two 
minutes, then pour off into another cup sugar. Flavor with spice, cloves, cinna- 
mon and butter. Bake thin crust. 

RASPBERRY PIE 

Take two boxes of red raspberries, mash and add about 1 cupful of 
powdered sugar. Let stand at least 2 hours in ice box, then put through 
cheese cloth, add about % cup powdered sugar, 1 cup water, juice of % lemon 
and small bottle of cream. Freeze. This mixture makes about a good quart. 

Grate the rind of the lemons into a bowl, and squeeze in the juice. Make 
a boiling syrup of the sugar and half the water and pour it hot on the lemon 
zest, and juice, and let it remain until cold; then add the rest of the water. 
Strain the lemonade into a freezer and freeze as usual and at last add the 
whites whipped to a firm froth, beat, and freeze again. The scalding draws 
the flavor from the lemons. It should never be boiled and fewer lemons used 
when they are very large. This ice is perfectly white. 

APPPLE MERINGUE PIE 

Pare, slice, stew and sweeten ripe, tart and juicy apples, mash and season 
with nutmeg (or lemon peel), fill crust and bake till done; spread over the 
apple a thick meringue made by whipping to froth whites of three eggs for 
each pie, sweetening with three tablespoonfuls powdered sugar; flavor with 
vanilla, beat well, and cover pie three-quarters of an inch thick. Set back 
in a quick oven till well "set," and eat cold. In their season substitute 
peaches for apples. 

CUSTARD PIE 

Six eggs, one and one-half cupfuls of sugar, one cupful of butter, six table- 
spoonfuls of corn starch or Gold Medal Flour and three cups of milk; flavor to 
taste. This is sufficient for three pies; bake with one crust only. 

PINEAPPLE PIE 

Slice of butter and a cup of sugar beat to a cream; add yolks of four eggs 
well beaten; then add a small can of grated pineapple. Last of all add the 
whites of two eggs well beaten and enough milk to suit taste. Line a deep pie 
plate with a rich crust. Put in custard and bake. When done beat the whites 
of two eggs, spread over top and brown.

sugar, put over pie and set back in oven to brown. (Bake with only under 
crust.)

place a cloth and tie firmly, so as to exclude the air and prevent the evapora- 
tion of the brandy. The mince meat should be kept in a cold place. It is

CONSOMME OR PLAIN MEAT STOCK FOR SOUP 

Consomme o? stock forms the basis of all meat soups, gravies and purees. 
The simpler it is made, the longer it keeps. It is best made of fresh uncooked 
beef and some broken bones, to which may be added the remnants of broken 
meats. In a home where meat forms part of the every-day diet, a good cook 
will seldom be without a stock-pot. 

Four pounds of beef and broken bones, one gallon of cold water and two 
teaspoonfuls of salt. Put the meat and water on the back of the stove and let 
it slowly come to a boil, then simmer three or four hours, until the water is 
boiled away one-half; add the salt, strain and set to cool, in an earthenware 
dish well covered. When cold, take off the fat from the top and it is ready 
for use. To make soup for a family of six, take one-quarter of the stock, to 
which add one-quarter of boiling water, and any vegetables desired boil three 
hours. Season with salt and pepper. 

BARLEY BROTH 

Put two pounds of shin beef in one gallon of water. Add a teacup of pearl 
barley, 3 large onions and a small bunch of parsley minced, 3 potatoes sliced, 
a little thyme and pepper, salt to taste. Simmer steadily three hours, and stir 
often, so that the meat will not burn. Do not let it boil. Always stir soup or 
broth with a wooden spoon. 

TURKEY SOUP 

Place the remains of a cold turkey and what is left of the dressing and 
gravy in a pot, and cover it with cold water. Simmer slowly four hours, and let 
stand until the next day. Take off what fat may have arisen, and take out 
with a skimmer all the bits of bones. Put the soup on to heat until at boiling 
point, then thicken slightly with flour stirred into a cup of cream, and season 
to taste. Pick off all the meat from bones, put it back in the soup, boil up and 
serve. 

MOCK TURTLE SOUP 

Take a calf 's head, a knuckle of veal, a hock of ham, six potatoes sliced thin, 
three turnips, parsley and sweet marjoram chopped fine, and pepper. Forced 
meat balls of veal and beef, half a pint of wine, one dozen egg balls, juice of 
a lemon. The calf's head must have had the brains removed, and must have 
been boiled previously till the meat slips off the bone. The broth must be 
saved, so as to use in the soup. Cut the head in small pieces after boiling. The 
veal and ham also must have been boiled and cut up, and all simmered for a 
couple of hours in the broth made by the calf's head. Now put all together. 
The forced meat balls and egg balls should be added, and all boiled about ten 
minutes. 

VEGETABLE SOUP WITH STOCK 

Cut three onions, three turnips, one carrot and four potatoes. Put them 
into a stew-pan with two tablespoonfuls of butter and a teaspoonful of 
powdered sugar. After it has cooked ten minutes, add two quarts of stock, and 
when it comes to a boil put aside to simmer until the vegetables are tender 
about one-half hour.

IDEAS IN SALADS 

Prepare celery stalks very carefully by removing the stringy fiber until 
entirely free from shreds. Chop quite fine, and to two cupfuls of celery add 
two cupfuls of chopped lettuce, the latter crisp and fresh as possible. Season 
with salt, pepper and thyme, vinegar, olive oil, bay leaf. If possible, add half 
a teaspoonful shoyu, or Japanese sauce, which greatly improves the flavor. 
Mix all thoroughly and then add crab, shrimp, sardine, spiced mackerel or 
halibut filling. Boiled halibut, chilled in salt water, makes a good combination 
with crab, and when broken into small portions and allowed to stand for an 
hour or so, in the same salt water with crab, can with difficulty be distinguished 
from the crab itself. For sardine, potato, and meat salads, a tablespoonful of 
onion juice is desirable. 

Make mayonnaise dressing by using the yolks of three or four eggs, accord- 
ing to the quantity desired, and after beating add, drop by drop, pure olive 
oil, stirring constantly until the mixture begins to thicken. Then a larger 
quantity of oil may be stirred in until the mixture becomes of proper con- 
sistency, about like heavy cream; do not season until thickened for fear of 
curdling. Salt very sparingly, and if desired sift in a little cayenne pepper, a 
few drops of lemon, two teaspoonfuls of spiced mustard vinegar from mustard 
pickles. 

CHICKEN SALAD 

Cut cold roast or boiled chicken in small dice, add celery cut fine, season 
with salt and pepper. Mix with French dressing and put aside for an hour or 
more. Just before serving stir in some mayonnaise slightly thinned with 
lemon juice or French dressing, arrange on lettuce leaves and cover with thick 
mayonnaise. 

CRAB SALAD 

One pint of crab meat, two stalks of celery, cut fine; one hard-boiled egg, 
chopped fine, and one tomato cut into small pieces; season with salt, pepper 
and vinegar, mix in salad bowl, garnishing it with crisp leaves of Ittuce; dress 
with mayonnaise dressing. 

LOBSTER SALAD 

Cut the lobster into small squares and season with two tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar, two of oil, one teaspoonful of salt and pepper and let it stand in a 
cool place for an hour. When ready to serve line the salad bowl with crisp 
lettuce leaves, and after mixing the lobster thoroughly with mayonnaise place 
it on the lettuce. Serve with toasted crackers and cheese. 

SALMON SALAD 

Remove bones and skin from salmon. Drain off liquid. Mix with French 
dressing or thin mayonnaise; set away for awhile. Finish same as lobster 
salad. Other fish salads may be prepared in same manner. 

TOMATO SALAD 

Pare with sharp knife. Slice and lay in salad bowl. Make dressing in the 
following manner: Work up saltspoon of each of salt, pepper and mustard, 
two tablespoonfuls of salad oil, adding a few drops at a time, and, when thor- 
oughly mixed, whip in with an egg, beaten, four tablespoonfuls vinegar; toss 
up with fork.

EGG SALAD 

Boil six eggs until the yolks are very mealy. Boil also one dozen medium- 
sized potatoes, with jackets on. Peel eggs and potatoes and cut in dice. Add 
two slices onions. Put first a layer of one, then of the other, until all is used. 
Pour over it some cream salad dressing. 

A DELICIOUS SALAD FOB STUFFED PEPPERS 

One can of sardines picked into fine pieces with a fork, two tablespoonfuls 
of chopped olives, two tablespoonfuls of chopped pickles, mayonnaise dressing 
and salt and pepper to taste. Remove the seeds, membrane and stem end from 
the peppers and soak in salt water. Mix the olives, pickles, etc., with the sar- 
dines and add enough mayonnaise dressing to hold it together. Then drain 
the peppers dry and fill with the salad. Garnish the plate with lettuce leaves 
and olives. 

SARDINE SANDWICH 

Take one can of sardines, remove the back-bone from the fish, add juice of 
one lemon, one tablespoonful of Worcestershire sauce. Mix the above thorough- 
ly and spread on buttered bread. Before placing layers of bread together, add 
a few slices of pickled onions. 

SARDINE PASTE 

Work required amount of sardines into a paste with a broad knife or 
spatula. Add to this very tiny pickled onions, the quantity depending upon the 
taste, about one-quarter as much onion as paste, is good. Season with Wor- 
cestershire sauce, salt, pepper, paprika, celery salt and a liberal amount of 
lemon juice. 

This is delicious for sandwiches, to serve on small pieces of toast with cock- 
tails, or on crackers with salad. 

SANDWICHES 

Take each fish, lightly scrape off skin and remove the tail, and pick the 
meat into convenient sized pieces with a fork. Put the pieces into a bowl of 
lemon juice and let stand a few minutes. Then drain and spread on thin 
slices of bread between fresh lettuce leaves. If the " Soused" Sardines are 
used, substitute mayonnaise dressing for the lemon juice. 

SARDINE SANDWICHES 

Very tasty sandwiches can be prepared by mincing fish with half the quan- 
tity of hard-boiled eggs and moistening with mayonnaise dressing. Place this 
mixture between thin slices of bread and cut into small squares with a sharp 
knife. 

CHICKEN AND LOBSTER SALAD 

~y 2 chicken, 1 pound tinned lobster, 

% pound tinned peas, Mayonnaise dressing,

CABBABE SALAD a la CALAIS 

First make a dressing in the following manner: Take two raw eggs, two 
level teaspoonfuls of salt and two level teaspoonfuls of dry mustard and * 
quarter teaspoonful of cayenne pepper or paprika and about five teaspoonfuls 
of sugar and one tablespoonful of butter and add two tablespoonfuls of milk, 
mix well and beat with a fork. Then take one cup of vinegar and boil separate- 
ly, pour slowly over the other mixture and when this is done boil slowly until 
thick. Grind up a fair-sized head of cabbage, one medium sized onion and two 
green peppers from which the seeds and fibre have been removed. Then mix 
with the dressing and serve. 

HOT SLAW 

Pick off the bad leaves from head of small cabbage, slice or cut the cab- 
bage very thin, scald it 5 minutes in 2 quarts of boiling water and drain 
through a colander. Mix it well with a sauce made of *4 cup of hot vinegar, 
1 cup of sour cream, yolks of 2 eggs, 3 tablespoonfuls of oil, salt and pepper to 
taste. 

JELLIED CHICKEN AND CELERY SALAD 

Make the chicken jelly and set it in a border mould. Chop three bunches 
of celery, and mix with one can of asparagus tips. When the jelly is cold set 
on a platter, and heap the celery and asparagus in the center. Slice four hard- 
boiled eggs and lay around the jelly in little piles, alternating with mayon- 
naise dressing. 

This is also nice made with fruit jelly with fruit in center, omitting the 
egg and using French dressing made with lemon instead of the mayonnaise. 

ROMAINE SALAD 

Take the heart of a Eomaine, don't wash, but wipe with a clean towel, one- 
half pint of cream, mix in pepper and salt to taste. This is the proper way to 
eat Eomaine, and the only way it is served in Paris, especially in private 
families. No dressing. 

MAYONNAISE DRESSING 

Put the yolk of an egg into a cup with salt-spoonful of salt, and beat until 
light, one-half teaspoonful of mustard and beat again. Then add olive oil, 
drop by drop, then a few drops of vinegar and the same of lemon juice. Con- 
tinue this process until the egg has absorbed a little more than a half a teacup 
of oil; finish by adding a very little cayenne pepper and sugar. 

FRENCH DRESSING 

Mix one-fourth of a teaspoonful of salt, dash of white pepper, 3 table- 
spoonfuls olive oil. Stir for few minutes, then gradually add 1 tablespoonful 
vinegar, stirring rapidly until mixture is slightly thickened and vinegar cannot 
be noticed. Mixture will separate in about twenty minutes.

TO FEY FISH 

After the fish is well cleansed, lay it on a folded towel and dry out all the 
water; when well wiped and dry, roll it in wheat flour, rolled crackers, grated 
stale bread or Indian meal, whichever may be preferred; Gold Medal Flour will 
generally be liked. Have a thick-bottomed frying-pan with plenty of sweet 
lard salted (a tablespoonful of salt to each pound of lard) for fresh fish which 
have not been previously salted; let it become boiling hot, then lay the fish 
in and let it fry gently until one side is a fine, delicate brown, then turn the 
other; when both are done take it up carefully and serve quickly, or keep it 
covered with a tin cover, and set the dish where it will keep hot. 

TO BROIL FISH 

Eub the bars of your gridiron with dripping or a piece of beef suet, to pre- 
vent the fish from sticking. Put a good piece of butter into a dish, enough salt 
and pepper to season the fish. Lay the fish on it when it is broiled, and with 
a knife put the butter over every part. Serve very hot. 

TO BAKE FISH WHOLE 

Cut off the head and split the fish down nearly to the tail; prepare a dress- 
ing of bread, butter, pepper and salt, moisten with a little water. Fill the dish 
with this dressing, and bind it together with a piece of string; lay the fish on 
a bake-pan and pour round it a little water and melted butter. Baste frequent- 
ly. A good-sized fish will bake in an hour. Serve with the gravy of the fish, 
drawn butter. 

BROILED SALT MACKEREL 

Freshen by soaking it over night in water, being careful that the skin lies 
uppermost. In the morning dry it without breaking, cut off the head and tip 
of the tail, place it between the bars of a buttered fish-gridiron, and broil to 
a light brown; lay it on a hot dish, and dress with a little butter, pepper, and 
lemon juice, vinegar. 

CODFISH BALLS 

Put fish in cold water, set on back of stove; when water gets hot, pour off 
and put cold again until fish is sufficiently fresh; then pick it up. Boil po- 
tatoes and mash them, mix fish and potatoes together, while potatoes are hot, 
taking two-thirds potatoes and one-third fish. Put in plenty of butter; make 
into balls and fry in plenty of lard. Have lard hot before putting in balls. 
Variation may be had by rolling each ball in beaten egg, then in dry bread 
crumbs before frying. 

FISH STEAKS FRIED 

Cut the slices of fresh fish three-quarters of an inch thick, sprinkle with 
Gold Medal Flour, or cornmeal slightly salted or dip them in eggs lightly salted 
and roll in crumbs; fry a light brown. Salmon or any other large fish can be 
fried this way.

CREAMED FISH 

Pick (not shred) one cupful of codfish; place in a spider and fill and cover 
with cold water. Stir a moment over the fire and pour off the water. Stand 
on the stove, cover the fish with one and one-half pints of milk and a large 
tablespoonful of butter. Stir into a cup of cold cream two tablespoonfuls of 
Gold Medal Flour and when the milk on the stove is about to boil mix this with 
it. When the mixture has thickened stand where it will boil no longer and stir 
into it one egg. Serve at once. 

FISH CHOWDER 

Two pounds of fresh white fish, a quarter of a pound of bacon, five small 
potatoes, one small onion, six tomatoes, one quart of milk, butter the size of a 
small hen 's egg and a teaspoon Gold Medal Flour. Pick the fish to pieces. Re- 
move the bone and skin; cut potatoes into small squares; the bacon in small 
pieces; rub the butter and flour to a cream. Spread in a granite kettle half of 
the potatoes, then half of the fish, then sprinkle in the minced onions, then the 
bacon, then half of the tomatoes. Then a shake of salt and pepper; add the 
rest of the fish, tomatoes, potatoes, and more salt and pepper, using in all one 
teaspoon of salt and one-fourth teaspoon of pepper. Cover with water, let 
simmer for half an hour. Scald the milk, put a pinch of soda into the chowder 
and stir; add the hot milk to the butter and flour; stir smooth; then add to the 
chowder. Serve very hot.

FISH BALLS 

The remnants of any cold fish can be used by breaking the fish to pieces 
with a fork, removing all the bones and skin, and shredding very fine. Add an 
equal quantity of mashed potatoes, make into a stiff batter with a piece of but- 
ter and some milk, and a beaten egg. Flour your hands and shape the mix- 
ture into balls. Fry in boiling lard or drippings, to a light brown. 

FISH CROQUETTES 

Take remnants of boiled cod, salmon or halibut and pick the flesh out care- 
fully. Mince it moderately fine. Stir a piece of butter, a small spoon Gold 
Medal Flour and some milk over fire until they thicken. Then add pepper, salt 
and a little grated nutmeg, together with finely-chopped parsley, and then the 
minced fish. When very hot remove from the fire, turn on a dish to get cold, 
then shape and finish the croquettes. 

CLAMS AND RICE 

Chop fine one onion and a small piece of ham or pork; add a bruised clove 
of garlic, one cupful of tomatoes and a little saffron water; stew all together 
for a few minutes, then add a pint of well scrubbed small clams, still in the 
shell; steam a half hour in a tightly covered dish; then add one cupful of well 
washed rice and about one pint of water; season with salt and cook until the 
rice is done.

CHAFING DISH RECIPE 

Skin the fish and lay on brown paper for a few minutes. Then dip in 
beaten egg and roll in finely powdered cracker crumbs. 

Place butter in a chafing dish so that when melted it will cover bottom of 
the dish to the depth of three-eighths of an inch. When hot place the sardines 
in and cook until nicely browned, being careful not to let them burn. 

Serve on a lettuce leaf with mayonnaise dressing. 

SARDINE BALLS 

Pick required number of sardines into fine pieces, season to taste with salt, 
pepper and onion juice. Make into small balls, handling as little as possible. 
When the chafing dish (or saucepan) is hot, butter the balls enough to prevent 
sticking, place in pan, and shake gently for a few minutes until brown. Serve 
hot. 

SHRIMP 

Have a pint of shelled shrimps. Then make a thick sauce; a heaped tea- 
spoonful Gold Medal Flour, half an ounce butter and a quarter pint of milk. 
Flavor it with a little mace, pepper and salt. Stir in the shrimps. When well 
heated pour the whole out onto a hot dish, trim the dish round with cold boiled 
rice, and serve.

SARDINES a la CAMBRIDGE 

Take a can of good sardines ("Mustard"), remove the backbone and out- 
side skin and rub the meat through a sieve; mix with it minced raw oysters, 
the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, a tiny dust of paprika, three ounces of fresh 
bread crumbs, one and a half ounces of warm butter, and the liquor from the 
oysters, and the yolks of two raw eggs. Divide the mixture into portions about 
the size of walnuts, roll each up in Gold Medal Flour and dip into beaten egg 
and then into freshly made bread crumbs, and put into a frying basket and fry 
for three or four minutes in clean boiling fat. Dish up in a pile on a hot dish 
on a dish paper, and serve hot. Garnish with a little fresh parsley around the 
dish. 

Remove the skin from a can of sardines and place them in a pan, add a 
piece of butter, a glass of white wine, a few shrimp, a dozen oysters, a few 
mushrooms and a few crusts of bread fried in butter, and when all is well 
cooked make the following sauce: 

Place in a pan a piece of butter the size of an egg and melt, then add a 
spoonful Gold Medal Flour and when brown, half a glass of the above mixture 
except the fish; use a wooden spoon. When the sauce is made, add the yolk 
of an egg and take from the fire. Place the fish in a dish, spread on the sauce, 
and put in a warm oven for fifteen minutes and serve.

SCALLOPED SARDINES 

One can of sardines, one cupful of sauce (as below), five or six soda crackers. 
Pick the fish over, removing back-bone and tail, and flake with a fork. Place a 
layer of the sardines in an agate baking dish, cover with the sauce, then a 
layer of the cracker crumbs, another layer of sardines, and so on until the fish 
is all used. Cover the top layer with cracker crumbs and bake in a hot oven 
until brown. Prepare the fish sauce as follows: 

SAUCE Two tablespoonfuls each of Gold Medal Flour, butter, cup hot 
milk, salt and pepper to taste. Melt the butter in sauce-pan until it bubbles, 
then add the flour, salt and pepper until smooth, and pour the hot milk in grad- 
ually, stirring each time. Cook until it thickens. This is a good sauce to serve 
with any fish. 

LOBSTER NEWBURG

nutmeg. Put in sauce-pan with two tablespoons butter; heat slowly. Add two 
tablespoons sherry; cook six minutes; add one-half cup cream beaten with yolks 
two eggs, stir till thickened. Take quickly from fire. 

STEWED MUSSELS 

Take about five dozen good-sized mussels, clean and then boil them until 
shells open. Put very little water on when boiling them, for when they are 
heated they let out plenty of juice themselves. When they are cooked take 
from shell and pick over. Put in a saucepan a piece of butter and some onions; 
fry until brown and add the mussels, a can of tomatoes and two cupfuls of the 
juice and stew all together for about fifteen minutes. Salt and pepper to taste, 
and lastly thicken the gravy with some Gold Medal Flour dissolved in cold 
water.

mixture; sift crumbs over top, heat to slight brown in quick oven. 

CREAMED CRAB 

Melt a half inch slice butter, add half a cup Gold Medal Flour, stir all the 
time; to this add three cups of milk and one cup of cream; season with salt, 
red pepper and one tablespoonful Worcestershire sauce. Cook ten minutes. 
Add the picked meat of three crabs and a small bottle of mushrooms. Let it 
come to a boil once. Serve in ramikins.

Poultry and Game 



BOAST TURKEY 

Carefully pluck the bird and singe off the down with lighted paper; break 
the leg bone close to the foot, hang up the bird and draw out the strings of 
the thigh. Never cut the breast; make a small slit down the back of the neck 
and take out the crop that way, then cut the neck bone close, and after the 
bird is stuffed the skin can be turned over the back and the crop will look full 
and round. Cut around the vent, making the hole as small as possible, and 
draw carefully, taking care that the gall bag and the intestines joining the 
gizzard are not broken. Open the gizzard, take out the contents and detach the 
liver from the gall bladder. The liver, gizzard and heart, if used in the gravy, 
will need to be boiled an hour and a half and chopped as fine as possible. Wash 
the turkey and wipe thoroughly dry, inside and out; then fill the inside with 
stuffing, and sew the skin of the neck over the back. Sew up the opening at 
the vent, then run a long skewer into the pinion and thigh through the body, 
passing it through the opposite pinion and thigh. Put a skewer in the small 
part of the leg, close on the outside and push it through. Pass a string over 
the points of the skewers and tie it securely at the back. 

Sprinkle well with Gold Medal Flour, cover the breast with nicely-buttered 
white paper, place on a grating in the dripping-pan and put in the oven to 
roast. Baste every fifteen minutes a few times with butter and water, and 
then with the gravy in the dripping-pan. Do not have too hot an oven. A 
turkey weighing ten pounds will require three hours to bake. 

BOAST GOOSE 

Get a goose that is not more than eight months old, and the fatter it is the 
more juicy the meat. The dressing should be made of three pints of bread 
crumbs, six ounces of butter, a teaspoonful each of sage, black pepper and salt 
and chopped onions. Don't stuff very full, but sew very closely so that the 
fat will not get in. Place in a baking pan with a little water, and baste often 
with a little salt, water and vinegar. Turn the goose frequently so that it may 
be evenly browned. Bake about 2% hours. When done, take it from the pan, 
drain off the fat and add the chopped giblets, which have previously been 
boiled tender, together with the water in which they were done. Thicken with 
Gold Medal Flour and butter rubbed together; let boil, and serve. 

BAKED CHICKEN 

Take a plump chicken, dress and lay in cold salt Water for half hour, put 
in pan, stuff and sprinkle with salt and pepper; lay a few slices of fat pork. 
Cover and bake until tender, with a steady fire. Baste often. Turn so as to 
have uniform heat. 

CHICKEN SOUTHEBN STYLE 

Wash your chicken thoroughly in soda and water. Dry and disjoint. Put 
one and one-half cups of cold water in a porcelain pot (Dutch oven preferred) ; 
pack chicken in closely. Mince two small onions, one kernel garlic, little pars- 
ley and sprinkle over chicken. Cover closely and let simmer for three hours. 
One-half hour before done season with salt and pepper. Don't lift cover dur- 
ing the cooking. When done remove chicken and thicken gravy with a little 
Gold Medal Flour.

WILD DUCKS 

Nearly all wild ducks are liable to have a fishy flavor, and when handled by 
inexperienced cooks, are sometimes uneatable from this cause. Before roasting 
them guard against this by parboiling them with a small carrot, peeled, put 
within each. This will absorb the unpleasant taste. An onion will have the 
same effect; but unless you mean to use onion in the stuffing, the carrot i 
preferable. 

BOAST WILD DUCK 

Parboil as above directed; throw away the carrot or onion, lay in fresh 
water one-half of an hour; stuff with bread crumbs, season with pepper, sage, 
salt and onion, roast until brown, basting for half the time with butter and 
water, then with drippings. Add to the gravy, when you have taken up the 
ducks, a teaspoonful of currant jelly and a pinch of cayenne pepper. Thicken 
with browned flour and serve in a tureen. 

PIGEON PIE 

Clean and truss three or four pigeons, rub outside with a mixture of pepper 
and salt; rub inside with a bit of butter, fill with a bread-and-butter stuffing, 
or mashed potatoes; sew up the slit, butter the sides of a tin basin or pudding 
dish, and line (the sides only) with pie paste, rolled to quarter of an inch thick- 
ness; lay the birds in; for three large tame pigeons, cut quarter of a pound of 
sweet butter and put it over them, strew over a large teaspoonful of salt and 
a small teaspoonful of pepper, with finely cut parsley; dredge a large teaspoon- 
ful of Gold Medal Flour over; put in water to nearly fill the pie; lay skewers 
across the top, cover with a puff paste crust; cut a slit in the middle, ornament 
the edge with leaves, braids, or shells of paste, and put in a moderately hot or 
quick over for one hour; when nearly done brush the top over with the yolk of 
an egg beaten with a little milk, and finish. The pigeons for this pie may be 
cut in two or more pieces, if preferred. Any small birds may be done in this 
manner. 

BOAST PIGEON 

Clean and truss two young pigeons, mince the liver, and mix with them two 
ounces of finely grated bread crumbs, two ounces of fresh butter, finely chopped 
onion, a teaspoonful shredded parsley, a little salt, pepper, nutmeg. Fill birds 
with this forcemeat, fasten a slice of fat bacon over the breast of each, and 
roast. Make a sauce by mixing a little water with the gravy which drops from 
the birds, and boiling it with a little thickening; season it with pepper, salt 
and chopped parsley. 

QUAIL ON TOAST 

Take five quail, but don't remove the legs, for you would lose all the taste 
of the game. Wipe them well; string them tight, so as to raise the breasts. 
Put a little butter on each, a little lemon juice, and inside each the quarter of 
a lemon without the peel. Then put a very thin slice of pork, about two inches 
square, around each quail, with two or three cuts in each side, and string it 
tight. Let cook on a good fire, and when they are nearly well done, for white 
meat game must be well done, cut the strings; dress nicely on toast and serve 
hot. Pour the juice on the quail after having taken the fat off, and put some 
slices of lemon around the dish, one for each quail.

ROAST TAME DUCK 

Take a young farmyard duck fattened at liberty, but cleansed by being 
shut up two or three days and fed on barley meal and water. Pluck, singe and 
empty; scald the feet, skin and twist round on the back of the bird; head, neck 
and pinions must be cut off, the latter at the first joint, and all skewered firmly 
to give the breast a nice plump appearance. For stuffing, one-half pound of 
onions, one teaspoonful of powdered sage, three tablespoonfuls of bread crumbs, 
the liver of a duck parboiled and minced with cayenne pepper and salt. Cut 
fine onions, throwing boiling water over them for ten minutes; drain through 
a gravy strainer, and add the bread crumbs, minced liver, sage, pepper and salt 
to taste; mix, and put inside the duck. This amount is for one duck, more 
onion and more sage may be added, but the above is a delicate compound not 
likely to disagree with the stomach. Let the duck be hung a day of two, accord- 
ing to the weather, to make the flesh tender. Roast before a brisk, clear fire, 
baste often, and dredge with flour to make the bird look frothy. Serve with a 
good brown gravy in the dish, and apple sauce in a tureen. It takes about an 
hour.

RABBIT PIE 



Cut a rabbit into seven pieces, soak in salted water one-half hour and stew 
until half done in enough water to cover it. Lay slices of pork in the bottom 
of a pie dish and upon these a layer of rabbit. Then follow slices of hard- 
boiled egg, peppered and buttered. Continue until the dish is full, the top 
layer being bacon. Pour in the water in which the rabbit was stewed, and 
adding a little Gold Medal Flour, cover with puff paste, cut a slit in the middle 
and bake one hour, laying paper over the top should it brown too fast. 

VENISON STEAK BROILED 

Take the leg and cut slices from it, having a quick, clear fire. Turn them 
constantly. They should be served underdone. Butter both sides of the steak; 
sprinkle salt and pepper over the venison, garnish with parsley and accompany- 
ing it by a jelly sauce.

ROAST PIG 

Select a pig about six weeks old, wash it thoroughly inside and outside; 
wipe dry with a towel, salt inside and stuff it with a rich fowl dressing, making 
it plump. Sew it up, place it in the dripping pan, salt and pepper the outside. 
Pour a little water into the dripping pan, baste with butter and water a few 
times as the pig warms, afterward with gravy from the dripping pan. Roast 
from two to three hours. Make the gravy by skimming off most of the grease; 
stir in the pan a good tablespoonful of Gold Medal Flour, turn in the water to 
make it the right thickness, season and let all boil up once. Strain and turn 
into the gravy dish. Place the pig upon a large platter surrounded with pars- 
ley. Send to the table hot. In carving, cut off the head first; split the back, 
take off the hams and shoulders and separate the ribs. 

BAKED HAM 

Put a medium-sized ham in a pot and cover with sweet cider. Let it sim- 
mer gently for three and one-half hours. Skim frequently to remove the grease 
as it rises. When tender take out and remove the rind; cut the fat on top into 
diamonds and in each diamond stick a clove; then rub over the top of the ham 
one-half of a cupful of maple syrup, place in the oven and bake slowly for 
forty-five minutes. 

TO ROAST A LEG OF PORK 

Choose a small leg of fine young pork; cut a slit in the knuckle with a sharp 
knife, and fill the space with sage and onions, chopped, and a little pepper and 
salt. When one-half done, score the skin in slices, but do not cut deeper than 
the outer rind. Apple sauce should be served with it. 

SALT PORK, CREAM GRAVY, SOUTHERN STYLE 

Cut sweet cured salt pork into half-inch slices, put into saucepan, cover 
with cold water and bring to boiling point. Drain off water, add cold water, 
stand a few minutes, roll in Gold Medal Flour, two parts, corn starch, one part, 
mixed and seasoned with white pepper. Have one tablespoonful of hot bacon 
fat in the frying pan to prevent pork from sticking. Pour off fat as it melts 
while frying, brown and fry until reduced one-half. For one and one-half cups 
cream gravy allow three spoonfuls melted fat, add two level tablespoonfuls 
corn starch. Cook three minutes in the hot fat without browning, then add 
one and one-half cups milk, one-quarter teaspoonful salt, and cook until smooth- 
ly thickened. Serve for breakfast with baked potatoes and hot biscuit. 

ROAST SPARE-RIB 

Trim the ragged ends of a spare-rib neatly, crack the ribs across the mid- 
dle, rub with salt and sprinkle with pepper. Fold over, stuff with a turkey 
dressing, sew up tightly, place in dripping pan with a pint of water, baste 
often, turning it once or twice so as to bake both sides a rich brown. 

PORK CHOPS WITH TOMATO GRAVY 

Trim off skin and fat; rub the chops over with a mixture of powdered sage 
and onion; put small pieces butter into frying-pan; put in the chops and cook 
slowly, as they should be well done. Place chops on hot dish; add a little hot 
water to gravy in pan, one large spoon butter rolled in Gold Medal Flour, pep- 
per, salt and sugar, and one-half cup juice drained from can tomatoes. Stew 
five minutes and pour over the chops and serve.

PORK AND BEANS 

Soak one quart white beans over night in cold water. Drain, add fresh 
water and simmer till tender. Put in baking pan and place in center one-half 
pound fat salt pork, parboiled. Mix one teaspoon salt, one-half teaspoon mus- 
tard and one tablespoon molasses; add this to the beans, with enough boiling 
water to cover. Bake eight hours in a moderate oven, adding more water as 
necessary. 

FILLET OF MUTTON 

Cut a fillet, or round, from a leg of mutton; remove all the fat from the 
edges, and take out the bone; rub it all over with a very little pepper and salt; 
have ready a stuffing of finely minced onions, bread crumbs and butter, well 
seasoned and mixed; fill with this the place of the bone; make deep incisions 
or cuts all over the surface of the meat and fill them closely with the same 
stuffing; bind a piece of cloth around the meat to keep it in shape, and stew 
with just enough water to cover it; let it cook slowly and steadily from four to 
six hours, in proportion to its size and toughness, skimming frequently. When 
done, serve with its own gravy. 

SHOULDER OF VEAL 

Remove the bone, and fill the space it occupied with a dressing made as for 
turkey or chicken; keep well basted and proceed as with above. A fillet of veal 
may be prepared in the same way, by removing the leg bone with a sharp knife. 



TO FRY TRIPE 

Cut in pieces convenient for serving; beat an egg lightly and dip each piece 
in the egg. Have your frying-pan hot and fry brown in butter. It will take a 
good deal of butter to make it nice and keep from burning. 

BEEF OMELET 



One and one-half pounds of good beefsteak chopped fine, one cup suet, two 
slices of wheat bread soaked in water, two eggs and half a cup of sweet cream; 
season well with salt and pepper. Mold into a loaf or roll and bake three- 
fourths of an hour, basting frequently. 

ROAST BEEF 

To roast in a cooking stove, the fire must have careful attention lest the 
meat should burn. Lay it, well-floured, and seasoned, into a dripping pan, with 
rather more than enough water to cover the bottom; turn the pan around often, 
that all parts may be equally roasted, and baste frequently. The oven should 
be quite hot when the beef is first put in that the outside may cool quickly and 
thus retain the juices. A large roast of eight or ten pounds is much better and 
more economical than a small one, even in a small family. Allow a quarter of 
an hour for every pound of meat if you like it rare. It can be re-roasted on 
the next day. If much remains serve cold on the next, or in very thin slices; 
dip each one in flour, then chop two onions fine, place a layer of meat 
in a baking dish and sprinkle it with salt, pepper and onion; above this place 
a layer of sliced or canned tomatoes; alternate the layers till the dish is nearly 
full, moisten with the gravy, place a layer of tomatoes upon the top, fill with 
boiling water, cover with a plate and bake two hours.

BOAST LOIN OF VEAL 

Leave in the kidney, around which put considerable salt. Make a dressing 
the same as for fowls; unroll the loin, put the stuffing well around the kidney, 
fold and secure with several coils of white cotton twine wound around in all 
directions; place in a dripping pan, with the thick side down, and put in a 
rather hot oven, letting it cool down to moderate; in one-half hour add a little 
hot water to the pan, and baste often; after half an hour turn over the roast 
and when done sprinkle lightly with Gold Medal Flour and baste with melted 
butter. Before serving carefully remove the twine. A roast of four or five 
pounds will bake in about two hours. For a gravy skim off some of the fat 
if there is too much in the drippings; dredge in Gold Medal Flour; stil until 
brown, add hot water if necessary; boil a few minutes, stir in sweet herbs as 
fancied and put in a gravy boat. Serve with green peas and lemon jelly. 

ENTREE OF VEAL 

Take a piece of butter the size of an egg, three pounds of raw veal, one tea- 
spoonful salt, one of pepper and two eggs. Chop fine and mix together, adding 
two tablespoonfuls of water. Mold this into a loaf, then roll into two table- 
spoonfuls of pounded crackers and bake two hours. When cold, slice.

FRIED SWEETBREADS 



For every mode of dressing they should be prepared by half boiling, and 
then putting them in cold water; this makes them whiter and firmer. Dip in 
beaten egg and then in bread crumbs, pepper and salt and fry in lard. Serve 
with peas or tomatoes. 

VEAL CUTLETS, BREADED 

Trim and flatten the cutlets, add pepper and salt, and roll in beaten egg, 
then in cracker crumbs. Fry in good dripping, turn when the lower side is 
brown. Drain off the fat, squeeze a little lemon juice upon each, and serve in a 
hot flat dish. 

CALVES LIVER AND BACON 

Cut liver in one-half inch slices, soak in cold water twenty minutes, drain, 
dry and roll in Gold Medal Flour. Have pan very hot. Put in bacon thinly 
sliced, turn until brown; put on hot platter. Fry liver quickly in the hot fat, 
turning very often. When done, pour off all but one or two tablespoons fat, 
dredge in Gold Medal Flour until it is absorbed, and stir till brown. Add hot 
water gradually to make smooth gravy, season and boil one minute. Serve 
separately.

VEAL LOAF 

Three pounds chopped veal, one pound fresh pork chopped fine, three well 
ten eggs, butter size of an egg, one pint of bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon of 
salt, 1 teaspoon black pepper, one-half teaspoon each of thyme and sage. Make 



beaten eggs, butter size of an egg, one pint of bread crumbs, 1 tablespoon of 

pepper, one-h 
into loaf, take piece of white muslin and wrap securely, also the ends. Place 



in a baking pan with very little water. Baste often. Turn so as to brown both 
sides. Leave in cloth until cold. 

BEEFSTEAK AND ONIONS 

Take thick beefsteak (that which is not so tender will answer), cut it in 
pieces ready to serve; put into a spider with a little hot water; slice up three 
or four onions, and stew very slowly several hours. Let the water boil out and 
the meat become brown, then stir flour into the fat which has come from the 
meat. If there is too much, take some out and pour on boiling water, and stir 
until the flour is cooked. Pour the meat and gravy into a deep dish or platter 
and serve. Pieces of cold roast or steak can be used. 

Bay leaves, which can be obtained at the druggist's, are a good substitute 
for those who do not like onions, but the leaves should be taken out before 
sending to the table. 

BROILED STEAK 

Select your steak carefully. The wide end of the slice of "Porterhouse" 
is nice, or the "loin." Have the gridiron hot and buttered, and over hot 
coals; place the beef upon the gridiron, and cook till the blood begins to start 
upon the upper side before turning, if the fire is not too hot. To retain the 
juice, beef should be cooked rapidly at first. Turn frequently rather than 
scorch. When done, remove to the platter and season to the taste. Use no salt 
while cooking. This prevents the blood from escaping. Serve with mushrooms. 

BEEFSTEAK ROLL 

Select a nice, tender, sirloin steak; pound it well, season with salt and pep- 
per; then make a nice dressing of chopped bread, well buttered, salted and 
peppered, with a little sage, and mixed together with a very little warm water. 
Spread this on the meat, then begin at one end and roll it together; tie with 
strings. Put into a dripping pan with a little water. Bake about three-quar- 
ters of an hour. To be eaten warm, or sliced cold for tea. 

SPICED VEAL 

Chop three pounds of veal steak and one thick slice of salt pork, as fine as 
sausage meat; add to it three Boston crackers, rolled fine; half a teacup of to- 
mato catsup, three well-beaten eggs, one and one-half teaspoons of salt, one 
teaspoon of pepper, and one grated lemon; mould it in the form of a loaf of 
bread, put it into a small dripping pan, cover with one rolled cracker, and baste 
with a teacupf ul of hot water and two tablespoons of butter. Bake three hours, 
basting very often. % 

CREAMED DRIED BEEF 

Pick in small pieces one-fourth of a pound of thinly-cut rather moist dried 
beef and brown in a little butter. When brown pour in it a coffecupful of milk 
and cream. Let it come to a boil and slightly thicken with a little butter and 
Gold Medal Flour creamed together. When it boils, pour it over a platter of 
brown toast and serve it at once. 



76 THE JUST-WED COOK BOOK 

BEEF BALL 

Three pounds choice beef (rare) chopped fine, ten butter crackers crushed 
thoroughly, half teacup butter, pepper and salt to taste, half cup water, 
all well together, press down hard in pans, dip a few spoonfuls of the 



Mix 

........ * r- - - - water 

in which the beef was boiled over the top, and bake one and a half or two 
hours. Slice when cold. 



VEAL OB LAMB PATTIES 

Use cold veal or lamb; chop fine, taking equal parts of meat and bread 
crumbs; season with sage, salt and pepper, and moisten with eggs and melted 
butter, or gravies from the meat; make into little cakes, and fry in butter till 
well browned. 

VEAL LOAF 

Three pounds of veal, one and one-half pounds of salt pork, both chopped 
fine; two pounded crackers, two eggs well beaten, one nutmeg, two teaspoons 
of pepper, two teaspoons of chopped parsley, two teaspoons of celery, and the 
rind and juice of one lemon. Put batter on the loaf after kneading. Bake in 

TO BOIL COBNED BEEF 

Wash it thoroughly and put into a pot that will hold plenty of water; the 
water should be cold; skim with great care; allow forty minutes for every 
pound after it has begun to boil. The goodness depends much on its being 
boiled gently and long. If it is to be eaten cold, lay it in a vessel which will 
admit of its being pressed with a heavy weight, as salt meat is very much im- 
proved by pressing. 

MUTTON CHOPS 

Trim off the superfluous fat, and broil over a bright fire; season and butter 
them when cooked; do not have them rare. They can also be fried by first 
dredging with flour or bread crumbs. 

BAKED TONGUE 

Season with common salt, a very little saltpetre, half a cup of brown sugar, 
pepper, cloves, mace and allspice, powdered fine. Let it remain for a fort- 
night, then take out the tongue, put it in a pan; lay on some butter; cover with 
bread crumbs, and bake slowly till so tender that a straw will easily go through 
it. To be eaten cold. Will keep a long time, and is very nice for tea. 

FRIED LIVER 

Cut it in slices, and lay in cold salt water to draw out the blood. Some place 
it over a slow fire till the liver turns white. Take it out, roll each piece in flour 
or bread crumbs, season and put in hot lard. Cover, and cook slowly, till the 
liver is tender, then uncover and fry quickly till brown. Another way is to 
pour boiling water on the liver for a few moments, and proceed as above. 

IRISH STEW 

Take five or six mutton chops; the same quantity of beef, veal and pork; 
six or eight Irish potatoes, peeled and quartered; three or four onions sliced, 
and salt and pepper to taste; add a pint of good gravy, flavored with catsup, 
if liked. Cover all very closely, and let it simmer slowly for two hours (never 
allowing it to stop simmering). A slice or two of ham is an improvement. Stir 
occasionally to prevent burning.

BOILED BEEF'S TONGUE 

Boil a medium sized tongue three hours, or until so tender a broom corn will 
go through it easily; skim frequently when it begins to boil. When first re- 
moved from the fire skin it and set away to cool. If a pickled tongue, the water 
should be cold when put on to boil; if a fresh one salt thoroughly half an hour 
before taking it up. 

HASH ON TOAST 

Cold pieces of beefsteak are nice, chopped fine, cooked in a little butter 
and water, and thickened with flour; pour over pieces of toast laid on a platter, 
and moisten with hot water, salted. Garnish with hard-boiled eggs. 

HASH, WITH POTATOES 

Cold pieces of beef, either boiled, broiled or baked, can be used for the 
dish. Free the meat from all pieces of bone, chop fine, and mix with two parts 
of potatoes to one of beef. Potatoes boiled with the skins on are best. They 
should be cold, and chopped not quite so fine as the meat. Put them in a spider 
with melted butter or clarified drippings, and just enough hot water to keep 
from burning. Season to taste, and keep stirring till the whole is cooked to- 
gether. If liked crisp, let it remain still long enough to bake a crust on the 
bottom, and then turn out on a flat dish. Other meats may be used instead of 
beef.

Season and roast the same as beef, basting with butter and water till there 
is gravy enough to use. It requires to be cooked more than beef. Serve with 
currant jelly. 

SOUSE 

Clean pigs' feet and ears thoroughly, and soak them a number of days in 
salt and water; boil them very tender and split open. (They are good fried.) 
To souse them cold, pour boiling vinegar over them, spiced with pepper corns 
and a little salt. They will keep good, pickled, for a month or two. 

LAMB WITH RICE 

Partly roast a small fore-quarter of lamb; cut it in pieces, and lay in a 
dish; season, and pour over a little water; boil a pint of rice till dry, salt it, 
and stir in a piece of butter, also the yolks of four well-beaten eggs, only 
reserving enough to put over the top; spread the rice and the remainder of the 
eggs over the lamb, to form a covering; bake a light brown. 

TO GLAZE HAM 

The ham should be a cold boiled one, from which the skin was removed 
when hot. Cover the ham all over with beaten egg; make a thick paste of 
cream, pounded cracker, salt and a teaspoonful of melted butter. Spread this 
evenly over the ham and brown in a moderate oven.

BEEF'S HEART STUFFED 

After washing the heart thoroughly cut it into dice one-half inch long; put 
into a saucepan with water enough to cover. Remove scum. When nearly 
done add a sliced onion, a stalk of celery chopped fine, pepper and salt and a 
piece of butter. Stew until the meat is very tender. Stir up a tablespoonful 
of Gold Medal Flour with a small quantity of water and thicken the whole. 
Boil up and serve. 

BEEF STEWED WITH ONIONS 

Cut two pounds of tender beef into small pieces, season with pepper and 
salt; slice one or two onions and add to it, with water enough to make a gravy. 
Let it stew slowly, till the beef is thoroughly cooked, then add some pieces of 
butter rolled in Gold Medal Flour, enough to make a rich gravy. Cold beef 
may be cooked in the same way, but the onions must then be cooked before 
adding them to the meat. Add more boiling water if it dries too fast. 

BEEF TIMBALES 

Free left-over meat from fat and gristle, put through meat chopper, cutting 
finely. To one pint of meal add one teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth teaspoonful 
of pepper, put one-half cup of stock or water, two tablespoonfuls of bread, 
crumbs and one t ablespoonful of butter together in a saucepan over the "sim- 
mering burner; when hot, add to it the meat; take from the fire and stir in 
carefully two whole eggs, well beaten. Put mixture in buttered custard or 
timbale cups, stand in baking pan half filled with hot water. Bake in moderate 
oven fifteen to twenty minutes. Serve with tomato sauce. 

FRIED TRIPE 

Should be washed in warm water and cut into squares of three inches; take 
one egg, three tablespoonfuls of Gold Medal Flour, a little salt and make a 
thick batter by adding milk; fry out some slices of pork, dip the tripe into 
the batter and fry a light brown. 

TRIPE STEW 

Meit in stew kettle two tablespoonfuls lard, one of butter; add three medium- 
sized onions, three cloves and garlic, all chopped very fine; one cup chopped 
greens, a little parsley; one-quart can strained tomatoes, a pinch of dried mush- 
rooms, if handy; pepper and salt to suit taste; six large potatoes cut in quarters, 
lastly, three pounds plain boiled tripe cut in thin strips. Add boiling water 
if too dry. Serve hot. 

HASH 

Take cold pieces of beef that have been left over and chop them fine; then 
add cold boiled potatoes chopped fine; add pepper and salt and a little warm 
water; put all in a frying-pan and cook slowly for about twenty minutes. 

BEEF A LA MODE 

Take a piece of meat, cross-rib is best, put a slice of bacon or some lard in 
the bottom of pot, then the meat, and fill up with water till the meat is 
covered; then take two onions, some pepper-corns, cloves, bay leaves, one carrot 
and a crust of brown bread, salt and some vinegar; pepper, sprinkle flour over 
top and boil slowly.

OX-TAIL SAUTE 

About twenty cents worth of ox-tail for three people. Have them dis- 
jointed in pieces about an inch long. Take one large onion and brown in butter, 
one carrot, one turnip, one small piece of garlic, enough water to cover and 
cook slowly for four hours. 

BOILED BEEF WITH CABBAGE German Style 

Take one head of cabbage, and after removing all soiled and bruised leaves, 
cut in sections lengthwise making about eight or nine pieces, leaving the piece 
of heart attached to each piece to hold it together. Place in the kettle on top 
of beef, which has been boiling some time; boil together for one hour. Salt to 
taste and pepper. Lift out the meat, let the cabbage boil a few moments longer 
in the beef broth and send it to the table. 

HOT BEEF LOAF 

Take three pounds of steak from the round and grind it through a chopper. 
Beat two eggs, pepper and salt, one and one-half of fresh, soft bread crumbs. 
Press this into a shallow, oblong, tin loaf -shaped pan and cover with about 
eight slices of salt pork, cut thin. Add one-half cupful of water to the pan, 
bake an hour, basting often, then put in on a warm platter, removing pieces 
of pork. Thicken the gravy in the pan with a little Gold Medal Flour, and 
one-half canful of stewed mushrooms; pour over and around the meat and 
serve hot. It is good when cold if cut in slices and served with lettuce salad. 

BEEF PIE WITH POTATO CRUST 

When you have used the best of a cold roast of beef take the small pieces, 
or as much as will half fill a granite baking pan; also any gravy, a lump of 
butter, a bit of sliced onion, pepper and salt, and enough water to make plenty 
of gravy; put over a fire, thicken by dredging in a tablespoonful of Gold Medal 
Flour; cover it up where it may stew gently. Now boil a sufficient quantity of 
potatoes to fill up your baking dish, mash smooth and beat light with milk and 
butter and lace in a thick layer on top of meat. Brush it over with egg, place 
the dish in an over and let remain long enough to become brown. There should 
be a goodly quantity of gravy left with the beef, that the dish be not dry and 
tasteless. 

ROLLED STEAK 

Take a good rump steak, flatten and lay upon it a seasoning made of bread 
crumbs, parsley, pepper and salt, mixed with butter beaten to a cream. Boll up 
the steak, bind it evenly, and lay it in a dish with a cup of boiling water. Cover 
with another dish and bake forty minutes, baste often.

CAPER SAUCE 

Two tablespoonfuls butter, one tablespoonful Gold Medal Flour; mix well; 
pour on boiling water till it thickens; and one hard-boiled egg, chopped fine, 
and two tablespoonfuls of capers. 

GIBLET SAUCE 

Take the liver, heart, gizzard and neck of a chicken, wash and boil in salted 
water. Let boil till tender. Take them out with a skimmer and chop into 
coarse pieces. Put them back, add a little butter and thicken to a cream 
Pepper and salt, boil a few minutes and serve. 

SAUCE ROBERT 

One cup brown sauce made with stock, one teaspoonful sugar, one teaspoon- 
ful mustard, one tablespoonful vinegar. Simmer five minutes. 

TOMATO MUSTARD 

One peck of ripe tomatoes, boiled with two onions, six red peppers, four 
cloves of garlic, for one hour; then add a half pint or half pound salt, three 
tablespoonfuls black pepper, half ounce each ginger, allspice, mace, cloves; 
boil again for one hour longer, and when cold add one pint of vinegar and ? 
quarter pound of mustard; and if you like it very hot, a tablespoonful of 
cayenne. 

MINT SAUCE 

Mix one tablespoonful of white sugar to a half teacupful of good vinegar; 
add the mint and let it infuse for half an hour in a cool place before sending to 
the table. Serve with roast lamb or mutton. 

CELERY SAUCE 

Mix two tablespoonfuls Gold Medal Flour with half teacupful butter, have 
ready a pint of boiling milk; stir the flour and butter into the milk; take three 
heads of celery, cut into small bits and boil for a few minutes in water, which 
strain off; put the celery into the melted butter and keep stirred over the fire 
for five or ten minutes. This is very nice with boiled fowl or turkey. 
CURRANT JELLY SAUCE 

Melt one-half glass currant jelly over slow fire. Add one cup hot brown 
sauce; stir well and simmer one minute. 

CREAM OR WHITE SAUCE 

One cupful milk, a teaspoonful Gold Medal Flour and a tablespoonful of 
butter, salt and pepper. Heat butter in pan when hot, but not brown, add the 
flour. Stir until smooth; gradually add the milk. Let it boil up once. Season 
with salt and pepper and serve. This is nice to cut cold potatoes into and let 
them heat through. They are then creamed potatoes. It also answers as a 
sauce for other vegetables, omelets, fish and sweetbreads, or, indeed, for any- 
thing that requires a white sauce. If you have plenty of cream, use it, and 
omit the butter. 

HOLLANDAISE SAUCE 

Cream one-half cup butter. Add four well-beaten egg yolks, then the juice 
of one-half of a lemon, one-half teaspoonful of salt and a dash of cayenne. Pour 
a cupful of hot water in slowly. Mix and set in a saucepan of hot water. Stir 
until the sauce becomes a thick cream. Do not allow it to boil. Stir a few 
minutes after removing from the fire. It is a fine sauce for fish, asparagus or 
cauliflower.

HAM AND EGGS 

Fry the ham quickly; remove from the pan as soon as done. Drop the eggs, 
one at a time, into the hot fat; be careful not to let the yolks break and run, 
and keep the eggs as much separated as possible, to preserve their shape. The 
ham should be cut in pieces the right size to serve and, when the eggs are done, 
one should be laid on each piece of ham. If any eggs remain, they can be 
placed uniformly on the edge of the platter. 

CUREIED EGGS 

Slice two onions and fry in butter, add a tablespoonful curry powder and 
one pint good broth or stock, stew till onions are quite tender, add a cupful of 
cream thickened with arrowroot or rice flour, simmer a few moments, then add 
eight or ten hard-boiled eggs, cut in slices and beat them well, but do not boil. 

OMELET SOULFLE 

Take three eggs, two ounces of butter, one dessert-spoonful of chopped pars- 
ley, one salt-spoonful of chopped onions, one pinch of dried herbs. Beat the 
whites of the eggs to a very stiff froth; mix the yolks with the parsley and 
a little salt and pepper. Stir the herbs gently into them and continue as in a 
plain omelet. Fold the omelet and serve immediately. 

OMELET 

Six eggs, whites and yolks, beaten separately; half pint of milk, teaspoonful 
corn starch, one teaspoonful baking powder, and a little salt; the whites, beaten 
to a stiff froth, last; cook in a little butter. 

SPANISH OMELET 

Mince very fine enough ham, fat as well as lean, as will fill a small teacup 
and add two finely-chopped small onions, such as are used for pickling. Beat 
six eggs, stir the ham into them and fry the omelet the usual way, folding it 
over when done. 

SCRAMBLED EGGS 

3 eggs, Sprinkle with pepper, 

!/2 teaspoonful salt, 1 teaspoonful butter. 

1-3 cup milk or water, 

Beat the eggs slightly, add the milk and seasoning. Cook in a hot, buttered 
frying pan, stirring constantly until thick. Serve hot. 

OMELET ATI NATURAL 

Break eight or ten eggs into a basin; add a little salt and pepper, with a 
tablespoonful of water; beat the whole well with a spoon or whisk. In the 
meantime put some fresh butter into an omelet pan, and when it is nearly hot, 
put in an omelet; while it is frying, with a skimmer spoon raise the edge from 
the pan that it may be properly done. When the eggs are set and one side is 
a fine brown, double it half over and serve hot. These omelets should be put 
quite thin in the pan; the butter required for each will be about the size of a 
small egg.

EGOS A LA MODE 

Eemove skin from ten tomatoes, medium size, cut in a saucepan, add butter, 
pepper and salt; when sufficiently boiled, beat up five or six eggs, and just 
before you serve turn them into the saucepan with the tomatoes, and stir them 
one way for two minutes, allowing them time to be well cooked. 

OMELET 

Six eggs, whites and yolks beaten separately. One cupful milk, one table - 
spoonful of butter melted in the milk, one tablespoonful of Gold Medal Flour; 
cook slowly in a buttered skillet, on top of the stove, without stirring. 

POACHED OB DROPPED EGGS 

Fill a pan with boiling, salted water. Break each egg into a wet saucer 
and slip it into the water; set the pan back where water will not boil. Dip the 
water over the eggs with a spoon. When the white is firm and a film has formed 
over the yolk, they are cooked. Take them up with a skimmer, drain and serve 
hot, on toast. Season with salt. 

EGGS AND BACON 

Cut eight slices of bacon very thin, and fry until crisp; take them out and 
keep hot in the oven. Break four eggs separately into the boiling fat and fry 
until brown. Serve with the eggs laid over the bacon, and small fried pieces 
of bread placed round. Hash may be used instead of bacon. 

POACHED EGGS 

Have the water boiling, and the toast moistened in a little salt water, and 
buttered. Break the eggs, one by one, carefully into the water, let them boil 
till the white sets, remove with an egg slice, pare off the ragged edges and lay 
each egg upon a slice of toast; put over bits of butter, salt and pepper. Eggs 
require to be quite fresh to poach nicely. 

EGGS A LA CARACAS 

Chop finely two ounces smoked dried beef freed from the fat and outside 
skin. Add one cupful tomatoes, one-fourth cupful grated Old English cheese, 
a few drops of onion juice and a few grains each of cinnamon and cayenne. 
Melt two tablespoonfuls butter, add mixture and when heated, add three eggs 
slightly beaten. Cook until of a creamy consistency, stirring continually and 
scraping from bottom of pan. 

CURRIED EGGS 

Boil eight eggs hard, and cut into thick slices. Cook together in a saucepan 
a tablespoonful of butter and a heaping tablespoonful of Gold Medal Flour 
into which has been stirred a teaspoonful of curry powder. Stir until smooth, 
then add a large cupful of skimmed soup stock and cook, stirring all the time, 
to a smooth sauce. If too thick, add more stock. When smooth and of the 
consistency of cream, add salt and pepper to taste and lay into the sauce the 
sliced eggs, sprinkled lightly with salt. Cook until very hot.

SHIRRED EGGS 

Butter an egg shirred or small vegetable dish, cover bottom and side with 
fine bread crumbs. Add an egg very carefully, cover with seasoned bread 
crumbs, and bake in a slow oven until white is firm and crumbs are brown. 

FRIED EGGS 

Fried eggs are cooked as buttered eggs without being turned. They are 
usually fried with bacon fat, which is taken by spoonfuls and poured over the 
eggs. Do not have the fat too hot as that will give the egg a hard, indigestible 
crust. 

BUTTERED EGGS 

Melt one tablespoonful of butter, slip in an egg and cook until the white 
is firm. Turn over once while cooking, and use just enough butter to keep it 
from sticking. 

BREAD OMELET 

2 tablespoonfuls bread crumbs, 2 tablespoonfuls milk, 

1 speck salt, 1 egg, 

1 speck pepper, % teaspoonful butter. 

Soak the bread crumbs in the milk for fifteen minutes, then add the salt 
and pepper. Separate the yolk and the white of the egg and beat until light. 
Add the yolk to the bread and milk and cut in the white. Turn in the heated 
buttered pan and cook until set. Fold and turn on heated dish. 

ASPARAGUS OMELET 

Omelet, 1 can asparagus. 

1 cup white sauce, 

Follow any of the above omelet recipes. Make white sauce. Add asparagus, 
drained and rinsed, to the white sauce, spread some of the mixture over half 
of the baked omelet, fold over the other half, turn on platter and pour over the 
rest of the sauce. Use the cut asparagus. Cooked peas, cauliflower, or rem- 
nants of finely chopped cooked chicken, veal or ham may be used in place of 
the asparagus. 

EGGS AND TOMATOES 

Scrambled eggs with tomatoes make an appetizing luncheon dish. Take two 
good-sized tomatoes, peel, cut them in pieces, and fry them in a little hot olive 
oil. When cooked drain off the liquid and take four eggs well beaten, add 
some cream, and scramble. Mix the tomatoes with the eggs, seasoning with 
salt and pepper to taste. Serve on thin slices of toast. 

EGGS AND SPAGHETTI 

Take spaghetti and cook it with a cupful of grated cheese. When the 
spaghetti and cheese are cooked, add slices of hard-boiled eggs. Serve in a bowl 
garnished with pieces of soft toast. 

Among many other excellent dishes made with this paste are fried chicken 
with spaghetti and tomato jelly and macaroni au gratin in an Edam cheese 
case. 

EGGS IN BAKED POTATOES 

6 e gg s > 6 tablespoonfuls grated cheese, 

6 potatoes, 6 tablespoonfuls butter. 

Bake the potatoes, cut off the top and remove half of the inside of potato, 
in its place drop an egg raw, salt, cayenne pepper, 1 teaspoonful cheese in 
each and 1 teaspoonful butter. Put back into a hot oven for 4 minutes.

VEGETABLES 



SWEET POTATOES Southern Style 

4 boiled sweet potatoes, Lemon juice, 

14 pound butter, ^4 cup brown sugar. 

1 tablespoonful water, 

Skin boiled potatoes and quarter. Place in baking dish, with butter on top; 
sprinkle with the brown sugar; add the water and a little lemon juice. Brown 
in oven and serve hot. 

GLAZED SWEET POTATOES 

6 medium sized potatoes, *4 cup water, 

% cup sugar, 3 tablespoonfuls butter. 

Wash and pare potatoes. Cook ten minutes in boiling, salted water. Drain, 
cut in halves lengthwise, and put in a buttered pan. Make a syrup by boiling 
three minutes the sugar and water; add butter. Brush potatoes with syrup 
and bake 15 minutes, beating twice with remaining syrup. 

SPINACH WITHOUT WATER 

The following method is very little known and has the advantages of pre- 
serving all the nutriment in the spinach and avoiding the use of boiling water. 

Having washed and drained the spinach very thoroughly, cut it up in coarse 
pieces and put it in a saucepan in which you have heated three and a half 
ounces of butter to every pound of spinach. Add salt, grated nutmeg and cook 
sharply. 

SPINACH "AU NATURAL" 

Having cooked the spinach in salt water as before, wash and drain the 
leaves carefully, then remove all water and give them a few strokes with the 
knife without chopping them up. Put them into a frying pan in which you 
have heated some butter; salt to taste and serve very hot. 

This method of preparing spinach is very much appreciated in Italy, where 
they add filets of anchovies to it. 

DUCHESSE POTATOES 

Mashed potatoes, 1 egg. 

Take freshly boiled and mashed potatoes or some that are left over, add to 
them the beaten yolk of egg, place in a greased tin and form in balls, hearts or 
flat cakes, brush with the beaten white, and brown in oven. 

POTATOES WITH CHEESE 

Hash eight cold boiled potatoes, mix them with one-half cupful of cream, 
half an ounce of good butter, a pinch of salt and pepper and a very small dash 
of grated nutmeg. Place them in a dish, sprinkle over them two tablespoonfuls 
of grated American cheese, two tablespoonfuls of grated bread crumbs, a large 
teaspoonful of melted butter, and brown in the oven for ten minutes. 

BAKED PEPPERS 

Cold rice and stewed tomatoes can be made into a delicate filling for peppers 
by seasoning highly with spices and a little opion. These can either be baked 
directly or can first be fried in hot butter or olive oil, then put in a baking 
dish covered with a cupful of white stock and baked for half an hour or more. 
All baked peppers are better when cooked in stock.

LYONNAISB POTATOES (No. 1) 

Cook one onion thickly sliced in three tablespoonfuls butter until delicately 
browned. Remove onion and keep in a warm place. Add three cups cold boiled 
potatoes, cut in slices; sprinkle with salt, pepper, and stir until well mixed 
with butter. Press to one side of spider and let brown richly underneath, then 
sprinkle onions over potatoes; let heat thoroughly; turn on a hot serving platter, 
top side down; sprinkle with finely chopped parsley. Cooking the onion separ- 
ately lessens the danger of burning. 

LYONNAISE POTATOES (No. 2) 

1 pint boiled potatoes, cold, 2 tablespoonfuls beef dripping or 
y 2 teaspoonful salt, butter, 

Speck of pepper, 2 tablespoonfuls chopped parsley. 
1 teaspoonful chopped onion, 

Cut the potatoes into slices, season with teh salt and pepper. Fry the 
onions in the dripping till light brown, put in the potato and cook till it has 
taken up the fat. Add the chopped parsley and serve. 

ARTICHOKE SAUTE 

Cut six fine, green artichokes into quarters and remove the chokes. Trim 
the leaves neatly and parboil them five minutes in salted water, drain. Lay 
them in a casserole, season with salt, pepper and one-fourth cupful butter; 
one-fourth cupful mushrooms, chopped fine, may be added. Cover and cook 
in a moderate oven twenty -five minutes. Serve with any desired sauce. Hollan- 
daise is best. 

BAKED BEANS 

1 quart navy beans, 1 tablespoonful salt, 

1/2 pound fat salt pork, or 2 tablespoonfuls molasses, 

1% pounds brisket of beef, 3 tablespoonfuls sugar, 

y 2 tablespoonful mustard, 1 cup boiling water. 

Wash, pick beans over, cover with cold water and let soak over night. In 
the morning cover with fresh water, heat slowly and let cook just below the 
boiling point until the skins burst, which is best determined by taking a few 
on the tip of the spoon and blowing over them; if done, the skins will burst. 
When done, drain beans and put in pot with the brisket of beef. If pork is 
used scald it, cut through the rind in half -inch strips, bury in beans, leaving 
rind exposed. Mix mustard, salt, sugar, molasses and water, and pour over 
beans and add enough more water to cover them. Cover pot and bake slowly 
six or eight hours. Uncover pot the last -hour so that pork will brown and 
crisp.

For Six Persons. Time of Preparation, Two Hours 

3 pounds Brussels sprouts, A pinch of carbonate of soda, 

3 ounces butter, A pinch of pepper, 

1 tablespoonful Gold Medal Flour, Salt, 

1 pint stock, 1 teaspoonful chopped parsley, 

A pinch of nutmeg, % teaspoonful chopped onion. 

Throw the sprouts, after removing the outer leaves, into three quarts boiling 
water, with salt and a pinch of carbonate of soda. After bringing up to the

Jams and Jellies 



APPLE JELLY 

Select sound, red, fine-flavored apples not too ripe; wash, wipe and core; 
place in a granite kettle, cover with water and let cook slowly until the apples 
look red. Pour into a muslin bag and drain; return juice to a clean kettle 
and boil one-half hour; skim. Now measure and to every pint of juice, allow 
a pound of sugar; boil quickly for ten minutes. Bed apples will give jelly 
the color of wine while that from light fruit will be like amber. 

SPICED FRUITS 

These are also called sweet pickle fruits. For four pounds prepared fruit 
allow one pint vinegar, two pounds brown sugar, one-half cup whole spices 
cloves, allspice, stick cinnamon, and cassia-bude. Tie spices in thin muslin 
bag, boil ten minutes with vinegar and sugar. Skim, add fruit, cook till tender. 
Boil down syrup, pour over fruit in jars, and seal. If put in stone pots, boil 
syrup three successive mornings and pour over fruit. Currants, peaches, grapes, 
pears and berries may be prepared in this way, also ripe cucumbers, musk- 
melons, and watermelon rind. 

PLUM JELLY 

Take plums not too ripe, put in a granite pan and set in a pan of water 
over the fire. Let the water boil gently till all the juice has come from the 
fruit, strain through a flannel bag and boil with an equal weight of sugar 
twenty minutes. 

CRAB-APPLE JELLY 

Select juicy apples. Mealy ones are no good. Wash and quarter and put 
into a preserving kettle over the fire with a teacupful of water. If necessary 
add more water as it evaporates. When boiled to a pulp strain the apples 
through a flannel bag, then proceed as for other jelly. 

PRESERVED PEACHES 

Select the yellow red-cheeked ones if possible (skin same as tomatoes, by 
pouring on boiling water, then thrusting them in cold water and separate in 
halves). Proceed as for preserving cherries, only using three-quarters of a 
pound of sugar to every pound of fruit. 

PRESERVED CHERRIES 

Select the large cherries, remove the stems and stone them carefully. To 
each pound of sugar allow one pound of cherries. Put fruit in granite pan 
and pour over them the sugar. Stir up and let stand over night to candy. In 
the morning put all into the preserving pan, place on the stove and boil gently 
until the cherries look clear, skimming off the scum as it rises. When the 
cherries have become quite clear, remove the pan from the stove and seal. 
Keep in dry, dark closet. 

PRESERVED TOMATOES 

A pound of sugar to a pound of tomatoes. Take six pounds of each; the 
peel and juice of four lemons and a quarter of a pound of ginger tied up in a 
bag; put on the side of the range and boil slowly for three hours.

STRAWBERRY JAM 

To six pounds of strawberries allow three pounds of sugar. Procure some 
fine scarlet strawberries, strip off the stalks and put them into a preserving 
pan over a moderate fire, boil them for half an hour, keeping them constantly 
stirred. Break the sugar into small pieces and mix them with the strawberries 
after they have been removed from the fire. Then place it again over the fire 
and boil for another half hour very quickly. Put it into pots, and when cold 
cover it over with brandy papers and a piece of paper moistened with the 
white of an egg over the tops. 

LEMON MARMALADE 

Peel as many lemons as you wish and take out every seed. Boil the peel 
until very soft, add juice and pulp with a pound of sugar to a pound of lemons. 
Boil until thick and bottle. 

GRAPE MARMALADE 

Take sound grapes, heat and remove the seeds, then measure, and allow 
measure for measure of fruit and sugar. Place all together in a preserving 
kettle and boil slowly twenty -five minutes; add the juice of one lemon to every 
quart of fruit. Set away in jelly glasses. 

TO PRESERVE PLUMS 

To every pound of fruit allow three-quarters of a pound of sugar. Divide 
the plums, take out the stones, and put the fruit on a dish with pounded sugar 
strewed over; the next day put them into a preserving pan and let them simmer 
gently by the side of the fire for about thirty minutes, then boil them quickly; 
removing the scum as it rises, and keep them constantly stirred, or the jam will 
stick to the bottom of the pan. Crack the stones and add the kernels to the 
preserve when it boils. 

QUINCE PRESERVES 

Pare and core the fruit and boil till very tender. Make a syrup of a pound 
of sugar for each pound of the fruit and after removing the scum boil the 
quinces in this syrup for one-half hour. 

PRESERVED LEMON PEEL 

Make a thick syrup of white sugar, chop the lemon peel fine and boil it in 
the syrup ten minutes; put in glass tumblers and paste paper over. A teaspoon- 
f ul of this makes a loaf of cake, or a dish of sauce nice. 

BLACKBERRY JAM 

Crush a quart of fully ripe blackberries with a pound of the bset loaf sugar 
pounded very fine; put it into a preserving pan, and set it over a gentle fire 
until thick, add a glass of brandy, and stir it again over the fire for about a 
quarter of an hour; then put it into pots and when cold tie them over.

MAXWELL $685, F. O. B. Reno 
MAXWELL ROADSTER $670 F. O. B. Reno 

Compare a MAXWELL with any other car costing less 
than $900. There isn't one that can afford you the great, big 
real value that is in the MAXWELL. Just for example, con- 
sider the equipment. 

The MAXWELL has electric lights and starter, demount- 
able rims, rain-vision windshield, speedometer, mohair top, 
irreversible steering gear, linoleum covered running-boards and 
many other refinements such as are found on cars costing 
$1,100 and more. 

And these MAXWELL features are included at the price 
of $685. Did you ever hear of any other car at anywhere near 
this price that affords such big values? You may take our 
word for it, there is none. 

When you consider further, that the MAXWELL is a 
good looking car; that it is easy riding; that it carries five 
passengers in comfort ; that it is the World 's Endurance Cham- 
pion ; that it is light in weight and inexpensive to operate 
than you will agree with us when we say that the MAXWELL 
is absolutely the biggest value in the automobile field today. 

Just phone or drop into our new Sales Room and let us 
show you the cars. We shall gladly give you a ride.

HOW TO MEASURE AN OUNCE 

Housekeepers are often confused by the mingling of weights and measures 
in a recipe, therefore an accurate schedule is a good thing to have around. The 
following of the most generally used articles will be found correct: 

One ounce granulated sugar equals two level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce flour, four level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce butter, two level teaspoonfuls. 

One ounce ground coffee, five level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce cornstarch, three level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce thyme, eight level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce grated chocolate, three level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce pepper, four level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce salt, two level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce mustard, four level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce cloves, four level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce cinnamon, four and a half level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce mace, four level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce curry, four level tablespoonfuls. 

One ounce chopped suet, a fourth of a cupful.

ROLLED OATS A Perfect Infant's Food 

Put two teacups Rolled Oats into three pints of boiling water into which 
has been put one-half teaspoonful salt. Boil this about two hours or until the 
quantity is reduced to one quart. Press the liquid portion through a sieve with 
a tablespoon until the meal remaining in the sieve is dry. Put away in bottle, 
and at feeding time use one-half Rolled Oats and one-half milk. This quantity 
should last twenty-four hours.

Household Hints 



Mildew in white clothes may be removed by soaking for a short time in a 
pail of water to which has been added a heaping teaspoonful of chloride of 
lime. Then hang in sun. Repeat if necessary. 

When frying potatoes, etc., try chopping with empty baking powder can 
instead of knife. You will find it much more handy and quicker. 

Try greasing cake and bread pans with a small five-cent paint brush. Keep 
grease in round tin can; cut hole in cover and insert handle of paint brush 
when not in use. It is then always ready for use and does not soil the hands. 

To prevent cake from burning when using new tins, butter the new tins 
well and place them in a moderate over for fifteen minutes. After this the 
cake may be cooked in them without danger of burning. 

When ironing with gas, place a lid of the coal stove over the gas burners 
and place the irons over this. The irons will always be clean and heat much 
better than if they are put directly over the gas flame. 

To clean plaster of paris figures, use toilet soapsuds and a shaving brush. 
Einse well. Dipping them in a strong solution of alum water will give them 
the appearance of alabaster. 

To preserve gilt frames, cover them when new with a coat of white varnish. 
All specks can be washed off with water without injury. 

To keep lemons, put them in water. Change once a week. Will keep a 
long time. 

DO YOU KNOW 

That a small piece of butter added to the water prevents vegetables, maca- 
roni or rice from boiling over? 

That the water from macaroni or rice after they have been cooked should 
be saved for soup and gravies? 

That a teaspoonful of vinegar added to boiled meat, while cooking, makes 
the meat tender? 

That after peeling onions if celery salt is rubbed over the hands before 
washing the odor will disappear? 

That if you add a pinch of salt to ground coffee before boiling it will im- 
prove the flavor? 

That if kid gloves are rubbed gently with bread crumbs after each time 
them are worn they will remain clean much longer than otherwise? 

That a poultice made of tobacco and warm water, put between two cloths 
and placed over the breast and pit of the stomach will relieve convulsions when 
nothing else will? It will do no harm. 

That any one who has aching feet, ^f the feet are placed in kerosene for 
about ten minutes each day will receive the greatest relief. If used regularly 
for a month is said to cure all corns and callous places on the feet. Will not 
blister or do any injury. 

To relieve burns get a small bottle of picric acid and with a feather paint 
the burned or scalded parts, allowing it to dry. In a few minutes all the pain 
will be gone and you will never feel it again. Where the burns are very severe 
more than one application is sometimes necessary. This is an invaluable 
remedy, especially where there are children in the home, for they are getting 
burned continually. 

There is nothing better than sulphur tea for the hair. It cures dandruff, 
promotes the growth, makes the hair soft and glossy and is very good to keep 
the hair from turning gray. 

The whitish stain left on a mahogany table by a jug of boiling water or a 
very hot dish may be removed by rubbing in oil and afterward pouring a little 
spirits of wine on the spot and rubbing it dry with a cloth. 

Wash your weathered oak woodwork and furniure with milk. 

To rid your home of ants mix thoroughly two parts borax with one part 
powdered sugar and put around where the ants come. For two or three days 
the ants will come in swarms, but after that they will disappear. Leave the 
powder around for a week or two and you will never be bothered again with 
ants. 

If food becomes slightly burned in cooking, set the saucepan in cold water 
and it will take away burned taste.
