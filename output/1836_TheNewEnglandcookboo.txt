PREFACE. 



The writer deems lhat no apology need be offered 
for adding another to the long list of works on the tru- 
ly interesting, if not noble science of gastronomy, 
provided she has accomplished the desirable object of 
producing a work that will commend itself to all per- 
sons of true taste ; that is to say, those whose taste 
has not been vitiated by a mode of living contrary to 
her own. She has made that her aim, and although 
not an tide or Kitchener, she does profess to have 
sufficient knowledge of the occult science, if properly 
imparted, to enKghte,n. tuose, not .versed jo culinary lore. 

The utter inefficiency 'of. ,mo& ^qrlis-' bf the kind.

are well known to ey>??:>y > cxp3riqnDe,d housekeeper, 
serving but to lead the:ur/Va<;ia.ted,t>;s'^3y, who following 
implicitly the directions; ^>5ve;n /hayjt} 'to lament in the 
language of that homely rju't hot inapt pioverb, that their 
cake is all dough. Among the few exceptions she 
would mention the Frugal Housewife by Mrs. Child, 
which is a very useful book, and fully answers its au 
thor's design ; but that is limited as its name imports 
to the plainest cooking, and is not intended for those 
who can afford to consult their taste in preference to 
their purse. The writer of this short but she trusts 
comprehensive work, has endeavored to combine both 
economy, and that which would be agreeable to the 



IV PREFACE. 



palate, but she has never suffered the former to super- 
sede the latter. 

Although the mode of cooking is such as is gen- 
erally practiced by good notable Yankee housekeep- 
ers, yet the New England Cook Book is not so local 
but that it will answer like a modern almanac, without 
any material alteration for almost any meridian. It is 
intended for all classes of society and embracing both 
the plainest and richest cooking, joined to such mi- 
nuteness of directions as to leave as little as possible 
to the judgment of the practitioner, proving to the un- 
skilled quite a desideratum, while in the hands of the 
head of the culinary department, it will prevent that 
incessant running to and fro for directions, with which 
housekeepers' patience are too often tried. The expe- 
rienced cook may smile at the simplicity and minute- 
ness of some: o'f,thv3 receipts*, ;yet if nhe has witnessed 
as much good food spoiled 'by -improper cooking as 
the writer of these; re,c<ipts,' ; :$fce will not think she 

* i < * * i i * 

has been unnecessarily 'plain. In regard to the sea- 
soning of food, it has been fpund impossible to give any 
exact rules, as so much depends on the quality of the 
food and seasoning. 

The cook should be careful not to have the natural 
flavor of the food overpowered by the seasoning, and 
where a variety of spices are used, no one should pre- 
dominate over the other. 

Measuring has been adopted as far as practicable, 
in preference to weighing, on account of its being 
more convenient. As many people have not a set of 
measures, it has been thought best to use such 



PREFACE. 



sils as every one has, viz. tumblers, tea cups, wine 
glasses, &tc. but as they may be thought rather too in- 
definite by some, the exact quantity will here be sta- 
ted; most tumblers are a good half pint measure, wine 
glasses usually hold half a gill, and table spoons the 
fifth of a gill ; by tea cups are meant the old fashioned 
ones, which hold very little over a gill. 

In conclusion the writer would give her sincere 
thanks, to those of her friends who have kindly furnish- 
ed her with many of their choice and rare receipts, 
and to the public she would not add any thing more 
in its favor, being strongly impressed with the truth of 
the adage, that the proof of the pudding is in the eating.

PRACTICAL COOKERY. 



1. Meat. 

To be in perfection meat should be kept several 
days, when the weather will admit of it. Beef and 
mutton should be kept at least a week in cold weath- 
er, and poultry three or four days. In summer meat 
should be kept in a cool airy place, away from the 
flies, and if there is any danger of its spoiling sprinkle 
a little salt over it. When meat is frozen it should be 
put in cold water and remain in it till the frost is en- 
tirely out, if there is any frost in it when put to the 
fire, it will be impossible to cook it well. Fresh 
meat should not be put into the pot until the water 
boils. When meat is loo salt, soak it in lukewarm 
water for several hours, change the water before boil- 
ing it. Meat should boil gently with just water 
enough to cover it, and the side that is to go upon the 
table should be put down in the pot, as the scum that 
rises makes the meat look dark, it should be taken off 
as soon as it rises. The liquor in which all kinds of 
fresh meat is boiled, makes good soup. 

2. Roast Beef. 

The tender loin and first and second cuts of the rack 
are the best roasting pieces, the third and fourth cuts 
are good. The lower part of a rack of beef should be 
cut off as it prevents the meat from roasting thorough- 
ly. When the beef is put to the fire to roast a little 
salt should be sprinkled on it, and the bony side turn- 
ed towards the fire, when the ribs get well heated 
through, turn the meat, put it to a brisk fire and baste 
it frequently till done. If the meat is a thick piece 
allow fifteen minutes to each pound, to roast it in, if 
thin less time will be required.

3. Beef Steak. 

The tender loin is the best piece for broiling, thai 
from the shoulder clod or from the round is good 
and comes much cheaper. Beef before broiling if 
not very tender, should be laid on a board and pound- 
ed. Wash it in cold water, and broil it on a hot bed 
of coals, the quicker it is cooked without being burnt 
the better it is. Cut up about quarter of a pound of 
butter for 7 or 8 Ibs. of beef, put the pieces into a platter 
and when the steak is done, lay it on the butter, pep- 
per and salt it on both sides. 

4. Ala mode Beef. 

The round of beef Is the best piece to alamode. 
The shoulder clod is good and comes cheaper, it is 
also good stewed without any spices. For five Ibs. of 
beef soak about a pound of bread in cold water, when 
soft drain off the water, mash the bread fine, put in 
a piece of butter, half the size of a hen's egg, together 
with b,alf a tea spoonful of salt, the same quantity of 
mace, pepper, and cloves, also a couple of eggs and a 
table spoonful of flour, mix the whole well together, 
then cut gashes in the beef, and fill them with half of 
the dressing, put it in a bake pan with boiling water, 
enough to cover it. The bake pan lid should be 
just hot enough to scorch flour, put a few coals and 
ashes on the top, let it stew constantly for two hours, 
then place the reserved dressing on top of the meat, 
put in a piece of butter of the size of a hen's egg, heat 
the bake pan lid till hot enough to brown the dress- 
ing, stew it an hour and a half longer. When you 
have taken up the meat, if the gravy is not thick enough, 
mix a tea spoonful or two of flour with a little water, 
and stir it in, put in a couple of wine glasses of white 
wine, and a small piece of butter.

5. Beef Liver. 



The best way to cook liver, is to pour boiling water 
on it, dip it in salt and water, then broil it till nearly 
done, with two or three slices of salt pork previously 
dipped in flour, cut up the meat and pork into strips 
about two inches long, lay the w'hole into a pan with 
a little water,, salt andjpepper, put in a little butter, stew 
it four or five minutes. It is more economical to fry 
or broil it, but it is not as nice. 

6. To Corn Beef. 

To every gallon of cold water, put a quart of rock 
salt, an oz. of salt petre a quarter of a Ib. of sugar and 
a couple of table spoonsful of blown salt. (Some peo- 
ple use molasses instead of sugar but it is not as good)-, 
No boiling is necessary, put your beef in the brine, as 
long as any salt remains at the bottom of the brine 
it is strong enough. Whenever any scum rises, the 
brine should be scalded, skimmed and more sugar, salt 
and salt petre put in. When a piece of beef is put in 
the brine a little salt should be added, and if the weath- 
er is warm cut .gashes in the beef, and fill them with 
salt. Keep a heavy weight on the beef in order to 
keep it under the brine. The top of the weight is a 
good place to keep fresh meat from spoiling in hot 
weather. In very hot weather, it is difficult to corn 
beef in cold brine before it spoils, on this account it is 
a good plan to corn it in the pot, it is done in the fol- 
lowing manner, to six or eight Ibs. of beef put a tea 
eup of salt, sprinkle flour on the side that is to go up 
on the table and put it down in the pot, without any 
water in it, then turn in cold water enough to cover 
it, boil it two hours then fill up the pot and boil ii as 
hour and a half longer-

7. Mutton. 

The saddle, is the best part for roasting, the shoul- 
der and leg are good roasted ; but the latter is better 
boiled, with a piece of salt pork ; a tea cup of rice, 
improves the looks of it. Before putting the mutton 
down to roast, rub a little butter on it, sprinkle on salt 
and pepper ; cloves, and alspice improve it. Put a 
small piece of butter in the dripping pan, and baste it 
frequently, the bony side should be turned towards 
the fire first, and roasted. For boiling or roasting mut- 
ton, allow a quarter of an hour to each pound. 

8. Fed. 

The loin of veal is the best roasting piece, the breast 
and rack are good roasting pieces, the breast makes 
a good pot pie. The leg is nice for frying, and 
when severl slices have been cut off for cutlets the 
remainder is nice boiled with about half a pound of 
salt pork. Veal for roasting should be salted and 
peppered, and have a little butter rubbed on it, baste 
it frequently, and unless the meat is very fat put a 
small piece of butter in the dripping pan when the 
meat is put down to roast. 

9. Teal Cutlets. 

Fry three or four slices of pork, when brown take 
them up. Cut part of a leg of veal into slices about 
an inch thick and fry them in your pork fat, when 
brown on both sides take it up, stir about half a tea 
cup of clear water into the gravy, then mix a tea spoon- 
full or two of flour with a little water and turn it fn, 
soak a couple of slices of toasted bread in the gravy 
lay them on the bottom of a platter place your meat, 
and pork over the toast, then turn your gravy on the 



Mtats. 5 

meat. Some people dip the veal into the white of an 
egg and roll it in pounded bread crumbs before cook- 
ing it. It takes nearly an hour to cook this dish. 

10. Calf s Head. 

Boil the head two hours together with the lights 
and feet, put in the liver when it has boiled an hour 
and twenty minutes, before the head is done, tie up 
the brains in a bag and boil them with it. When these 
are done take them up and mash them fine, season 
them with salt, pepper and butter, sweet herbs if you 
like, use them as the dressing for the head. Some 
people prefer part of the liver and the feet for dress- 
ing, they are prepared like the brains. The liquor 
that the calf's head is boiled in makes a nice soup seas- 
oned in a plain way, like any other veal soup, or seas- 
oned turtle fashion. The liquor should stand till the 
clay after the head is boiled when the fat should be 
skimmed off. 

11. Coll ops. 

Cut part of a leg of veal into pieces three or four 
inches broad, sprinkle flour on them, and fry in butter 
till brown, then turn in water enough to cover the veal, : 
when it boils take off the scum, put in two or three 
onions, a blade of mace, let it stew gently three quar- 
ters of an hour, put in a little salt, pepper and the 
juice of half a lemon. Take it up, pour the gravy 
over it. The gravy should be previously thickened 
with a little flour and water. 

12. Flaw. 

Boil a piece of lean veal till tender. Then take it 
up cut it into strips three or four inches long, put it 
back into the pot, with the liquor it was boiled in, and 

1* 



6 Meats. 

a couple of tea cups of rice to four Ibs. of the veal, 
put in a piece of butter of the size of a hen's egg, seas- 
on it with salt, pepper and sweet herbs, stew it gently 
till the water has nearly boiled away. A little curry 
powder in this converts it into a curry dish. 

13. Jl Fillet of Veal. 

Take a leg of veal, cut off the shank, and cut gash- 
es in the remainder. Make a dressing of bread soak- 
ed soft and mashed, season it with salt, pepper and 
sweet herbs, chop a little raw pork fine, and put it in- 
to the dressing, if you have not pork use a little but- 
ter. Fill the gashes in the meat with the dressing, 
put it in a bake pan with water enough to just cover 
it, put the remainder of the dressing on top of the 
meat. For six Ibs. of veal, allow two hours steady 
baking. A leg of veal is nice prepared in this man- 
ner and roasted. 

14. Lamb. 

The fore and hind quarter of lamb are good roast- 
ing pieces. Sprinkle salt and pepper on the lamb 
and turn the bony side towards the fire first, if not fat, 
rub on a little butter and put a little in the dripping 
pan, baste it frequently. These pieces are good stuf- 
led like a fillet of veal, and roasted, the leg is also 
good cooked in the same manner, but it is better boil- 
ed with a little pork or salt, allow fifteen minutes 
boiling to each Ib. The breast of lamb is good roast- 
ed, broiled, or corned and boiled, it is also good made 
into a pot pie. The fore quarter with the ribs divided 
is good broiled, the bones of this as well as of all oth- 
er kinds of meat when put down to broil should be 
put toward the fire, a little butter, pepper and salt 
should be put on it. Lamb is very apt to spoil in 
warm weather, if you wish to keep a leg several days, 






Meats. 7 

put it in brine, it should not be put in with pork, as 
fresh meat is apt to injure the pork. 

15. Shoulder of Lamb Grilled. 

The shoulder of lamb is good roasted or cooked in 
the following manner. Score it in chequers about an 
inch long, rub it over with a little butter and the yolk 
of an egg, then dip it into finely pounded bread 
crumbs, sprinkle on salt, pepper and sweet herbs, broil 
or roast it till of a light brown. This is good with plain 
gravy or sauce, made in the following manner, with 
Haifa pint of the gravy, (or the same quantity of drawn 
butter,) put a table spoonful of tomato catsup, the 
juice of half a lemon, a little salt and pepper. 

i 

16. Lamb's Fry. 

The heart and sweet bread are nice fried plainly, or 
dipped into the white of an egg and fine bread crumbs, 
they should be fried in lard. 

17. Turkey. 

Take out the inwards and wash both the inside and 
outside of the turkey. Prepare a dressing of either 
boiled potatoes mashed fine or bread soaked in cold 
water, the water should be squeezed out of the bread, 
mash it fine, add a small piece of butter or pork 
chopped fine, put in pepper, salt, and sweet herbs if 
you like them, an egg mixed with the dressing makes 
it cut smoother. 

Fill the crop and body of the turkey with the dress- 
ing, sew it up, tie up the legs and wings rub on a little 
salt and butter. Roast it from two to three hours 
according to the size ; twenty five minutes for every 
pound is a good rule. A turkey should be roasted 
slowly at first and basted frequently, the inwards of a 



8 Meats. 

turkey should be boiled till tender, and the liquor they 
are boiled in, used for the gravy, when you have taken 
up the inwards, mix a little flour and water smoothly 
together, and stir it into the skillet, put in a little of the 
drippings of the turkey, season it with salt and pepper, 
and sweet herbs if you like. Drawn butter is used 
for boiled turkey. A turkey for boiling should be 
dressed like one for roasting, tie it up in a cloth unless 
you boil rice in the pot with it, if you use rice, put 
in a tea cup two thirds full, a small piece of pork boil- 
ed with the turkey, improves it. If you wish to make 
a soup of the liquor in which the turkey 'is boiled, let 
it stand till the next day and then skim off the fat. 

18. Goose. 

* 

If a goose is tender under the wing, and you can 
break the skin easily by running the head of a pin 
across the breast, there is no danger of its being tough. 
A goose should be dressed in the same manner, and 
roasted the same length of time, as a turkey. 

19. Chickens. 

Chickens for roasting or boiling, should have a dress- 
ing prepared like that for turkies. Half a tea cup 
full of rice boiled with the chickens, makes them look 
white, they will be less liable to break if the water is 
cold when they are put in to boil, a little pork boiled 
with the chickens improves them, if you do not boil 
any pork with them, put in a little salt. Chickens for 
broiling should be split, the inwards taken out, and 
the chicken washed inside and out, put the bony side 
down on the gridiron, and broil it very slowly till brown 
then turn it, when done take it up, salt, and butter it. 
About forty minutes is required to broil a common 
sized chicken. For roast chicken, boil the liver and 
gizzard by themselves and use the water for gravy, cut 
the inwards in slices, and put them in. 



Meats. 9 

20. Fricassee Chickens. 

The chickens should be jointed, the inwards taken 
out, and the chickens washed, put them in a stew pan 
with the skin side down, on each layer sprinkle salt 
and pepper ; put in three or four slices of pork, just 
cover them with water, and let them stew slowly till 
tender. Then take them up, mix a tea spoonful of 
flour smoothly, with a little water, and stir it into the 
gravy, add a piece of butter of the size of a hen's egg, 
put the chickens back into the stew pan, let them stew 
slowly for four or five minutes. When you have taken 
up the chickens, put two or three slices of toast into 
the gravy, and when soaked soft lay it in a platter and 
lay the chickens on top, and turn the gravy upon it. 
If you wish to brown the chickens, reserve the pork 
and fry it by itself, when brown take it up and put in 
the chickens, (when they are 'stewed tender,) and let 
them fry till of a light brown. 

21. Pigeons. 

Take out the inwards and stuff them, with a dress- 
ing prepared like that for turkies, put them in the pot 
with the breast side down, the water should more than 
cover them, when nearly done put in a quarter of a 
Ib. of butter to every dozen of pigeons, mix a little 
flour and water and stir into the gravy. When stew- 
ed tender, if you wish to brown them, take them up, 
and fry them in a little pork fat or butter, an hour be- 
fore they are done, put on a heated bake pan lid. 
They are very good split open and stewed with a 
dressing made and warmed up separately with a little 
of the gravy. It takes about two hours to cook tender 
pigeons and three for tough ones. Tender pigeons 
are good stuffed and roasted. They should be butr 
tered just before they are taken from the fire. 



10 Meats. 

22. Ducks. 

Are good slewed like pigeons, or roasted. Two or 
three onions in the dressing of wild ducks takes out 
the fishy taste. If ducks or any other fowls are slight- 
ly injured by being kept too long, dip them in weak 
sal eratus and water before cooking them. 

23. Baked Pig. 

Take out the inwards, cut off the first joint of the 
feet and boil them till tender, take them up and take 
out the bones, chop them a little. Prepare a dressing 
of bread soaked and mashed fine, season it with salt, 
pepper, butter, and sweet herbs, if you like, fill the 
pig with the dressing, rub a little butter on the out side 
to prevent its blistering. If you wish to have it go 
on the table whole, put it into a long dripping pan, 
put in a little water, set it in a well heated oven, bake 
it from two hours and a half to three, according to 
the size. When done take out a little of the dres- 
sing, and mix it with the chopped inwards, and feet, 
put in a little butter pepper and salt, let the pig stand 
in the open air a few minutes before it goes on the ta- 
ble, in order to make it crispy. 

24. Pressed Head. 

Boil ears, forehead, and rind, (the cheek is good 
but is better corned and smoked), boil them till the 
meat will almost drop from the bones, take them up 
when cold, cut the meat in strips about an inch long 
and half an inch broad, warm it in a little of the liquor 
in which the meat was boiled, season it with pepper, 
salt, cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon, when hot take it 
up and put it in a strong bag, put a heavy weight upon 
il, and let it remain till perfectly cold. 



Meats. 1 1 

25. Souse. 

Take pigs ear's and feet, clean them thoroughly, 
boil them till tender, take them out and when cold split 
them, lay them in a deep dish, pour on boiling vinegar 
strongly spiced with pepper corns, cloves and nutmeg, 
put in a little salt. When cold they are fit to cook, 
Fry them in lard. They will keep good pickled for 
four or five weeks. 

. ** 

26. Tripe. 

After being scoured should be soaked in salt and 
water, seven or eight days, changing the water every 
oiher day. Then boil it till tender, which will take 
eight or ten hours. It is then fit for broiling, frying, or 
pickling. It is pickled like souse. 

27. Ham. 

' A ham that weighs ten Ibs. should be boiled four 
or five hours, if too salt the water should be changed. 
Before it goes on to the table take off the rind, put 
pepper or whole clove in the form of diamonds all 
over it. The Virginia way of curring Hams is the 
following, dissolve two oz. of salt petre, two tea spoons- 
ful of sal eratus, for every 16 Ibs. of harn, add mo- 
lasses in the proportion of a gallon to a hogshead of 
brine. Make a salt pickle as strong as possible, put the 
above ingredients in it, then put the hams in, and let 
them remain for six weeks. Take them out and 
smoke them for three months. Hams cured in this 
way will keep good a long time and are very fine 
flavored. 

28. Tongues. 

Cut off the roots of the tongues, make a brine like 
that for curing beef, let the tongues remain in it for a 



12 Meats. 

week, then, smoke them eight or ten days. They 
require boiling four or five hours. The roots make 
very nice mince pies, but are not good smoked. 

29. Curries. 

Chickens, pigeons, mutton chops, veal, lamb and 
lobsters, make good curries. The meat should be 
boiled till nearly tender, if made of fowls they should 
be jointed before they are boiled. Put a little butter 
in a slew pan, when melted put in the meat and cov- 
er it with part of the liquor it was boiled in, let it stew 
for ten or fifteen minutes. For 4 Ibs. of meat, mix 
a table spoonful of curry powder, with one of flour, or 
a tea cup of boiled rice, put in a little water, and a 
table spoonful of melted butter, and half a tea spoonful 
of salt, turn the whole over the meat, and let it stew 

* * 

six or eight minutes. 

30. Curry Poivdcr. 

Pound fine, one oz. of ginger, one of mustard, one 
of pepper three of coriander seed, the same quantity 
of turmeric, half an oz. of cardamurns, quarter of an 
oz. of cayenne pepper, the same quantity of cinnamon 
and cummin seed. Pound the whole well together, 
sift and put them in a bottle. 

31. Chicken Pie. 

Joint the chickens, and boil them, till nearly tender 
in water just sufficient to cover them. Take them up 
and lay them in a dish, lined with pie crust, on each 
layer of the chickens, sprinkle pepper and salt, put in 
a little of the liquor that they were boiled in, three 
or four slices of pork and a small piece of butter, 
sprinkle flour over the whole. Cover it with a nice 
pie crust, ornament it with pastry cut in narrow strips. 
Bake it an hour and a quarter. 



Meats. 1 3 

32. Beef and Mutton Pie. 

Take meat that is tender, pound it out thin, and 
boil it ten minutes. Take it up, cut off the bony and 
gristly parts, season the meat highly with pepper and 
salt, butter it, and cut it in narrow strips. Line a deep 
dish, with piecrust, put in the meat, and to each lay- 
er, put a tea spoonful of tomato catsup, and a table 
spoonful of water, sprinkle flour over the whole, and 
cover it with piecrust, ornament it as you please with 
pastry. Cold roast, or boiled beef and mutton, 
cut in bits, and seasoned highly with salt and pepper, 
make a nice pie, put them in a dish, and turn a little 
melted butter over them, pour on water till you can 
just see it at the top. 

33. Chicken and Veal Pot Pie. 

Boil the meat until about half done, if chickens 
they should be jointed. Take up the meat, and put 
it in a pot with a layer of crust, to each layer 
of meat ; have a layer of crust on the top, cover the 
whole with the liquor the meat was boiled in. Keep 
a tea kettle of boiling water, to'turn in when the wa- 
ter boils away, (cold water makes the crust heavy.) 
If you wish to have it brown, heal a bake pan lid, 
and cover the pot while it is cooking, which takes 
about an hour. The crust for the pie is good, made 
like common pie crust, only very plain, roll it about 
an inch thick, cut it with a tumbler, into small cakes. 
Raised pie crust, is generally preferred to any other, 
it is made in the following manner. Rub together, 
three pints of flour one cup of butter, half a tea spoon- 
ful of salt, and then turn in a tea cup of yeast, and 
half a pmt of water. Set it in a warm place to rise, 
when risen, (which will be in the course of ten or 
twelve hours, in cold weather,) roll it out, and cut it 

2 



14 Meats. 

into small cakes. If it is not stiff enough to roll out, 
knead in a little flour, if too stiff, put in a little water. 
Potatoe pie crust is good, boil the potatoes, peel and 
mash them fine, put in a tea spoonful of salt, a 
piece of butter of the size of a hen's egg, and half a 
pint of milk, mix flour with it till of the right consis- 
tency to roll out, cut it into cakes, and put them with 
the meat. A very good way to make the crust, when 
you happen to have unbaked wheat bread j is to roll 
out the dough several times and spread butter on it 
each time, let it lay about half an hour, before you 
put it with the meat. 

34. To Frizzle Beef. 

Take tender smoked beef and shave it off thin, put 
it in a stew pan, with boiling water enough to cover it, 
let it stew ten or fifteen minutes ; three or four min- 
utes before it is done, thicken the water it is stewed in 
with a little flour, when taken up sprinkle on a little 
pepper. This makes a nice dish for breakfast, provi- 
ded the beef is moist and tender. 

35. Warmed over J\leats. 

Boiled or roasted veal makes a nice dish, chopped 
very fine, and warmed up with a little pepper, a 
small piece of butter, and a little water, if you have 
gravy, it is very good instead of the butter and 
water. A little nutmeg and the rind and juice of half 
a lemon improve it, the rind should be chopped very 
fine, (none of the white part should be used.) When 
well heated through, take it up and cut a couple of 
lemons in slices, and lay over it. Veal and fresh or 
salt beef, are all of them good, minced fine, with boil- 
ed potatoes, and warmed up with pepper, salt and 
gravy, if you have not gravy, use a little butter and 
water. Some people like boiled onions, or turnips. 



Meats. Gravies and Sauces. 15 

chopped fine, and mixed with the minced meat, in- 
siead of potatoes. Veal, lamb and mutton, are good 
ut in small strips, and warmed with boiled potatoes, 
cut in slices, and pepper, salt, and gravy. Roast 
beef and mutton, if not cooked too much, are nice 
cut in slices, and just scorched on a gridiron. Meat 
when warmed over, should only be on the fire just 
long enough to get heated well through, if on the fire 
long, most of the nourishment of the meat will be ex- 
tracted, and it will be very indigestible. Cold fowls 
are nice jointed and warmed up, with a little water 
and salt, then take the fow.s out of the water, put them 
in a frying pan, that has a little hot butter in it, and 
fry them, till of a light brown, they should have a little 
flour sprinkled over them before they are browned. 
Thicken the water with flour, that the fowls were 
warmed in, put a little butter in it, and turn it over 
the meat, when taken up. 

36. Jl Ragout of Cold Veal 

> 

Out boiled or roasted veal, in nice slices, flour and 
fry them in butter, till of a light brown. Then take 
them up and turn a little hot water into the butter 
they were fried in, mix a little flour with water and 
into the gravy, season it with salt, pepper, iace, and 
catsup, if you have any, and a little lemon juice. Put 
in the meat and stew it till very hot. 

37. Drawn Butter. 

Mix a couple of tea spoonsful of flour, gradually 
with a little water, stir it till free from lumps, thin it, 
and stir it into half a pint of boiling water, let it boil 
four or five minutes, then put in about a quarter of a 
Ib. of butler, previously cut in small pieces, set it 
where it will melt gradually. If carefully mixed it 
ivil! be free from lumps, if not strain it, before it is 



Gravies and Sauces. 

put on (o the table. If the butter is to be eaten on 
fish, cut up several boiled eggs into it. A little cur- 
ry powder sprinkled in it, will convert it into curry 
sauce. 

38. Burnt Butter. 

Put a couple of ounces of butter, in a frying pan, 
set it on the fire, when of a dark brown color, put in a 
table spoonful of vinegar, a little pepper and salt. 
This is nice for fish, or boiled eggs. 

39. Roast Meat Gravy. 

Meat when put down to roast, should have about a 
pint of water in the dripping pan. If you like your 
gravy very rich, skim off the top of the drippings to 
your meat, and use them, if you like it plain, stir up 
the drippings, strain them and put in a skillet and boil 
them. Mix a tea spoonful of flour, with a little cold 
water, and stir it into the gravy. Lamb and veal re- 
quire a little butter in the gravy. 

40. Sauce for cold Meat, Fish or Salad. 

Mix the yolks of two eggs boiled soft, with a mus- 
tard spoonful of made mustard, a little salt and pep^ 
per, two table spoonsful of salad oil, or melted but- 
ter, when well mixed, put in three table spoonsful of 
vinegar. A table spoonful of tomato, or mushroom, 
catsup, improves it. 

41. Wine Sauce for Venison or Mutton. 

Warm half a pint of the drippings, or the liquor, 
the meat was boiled in. When it boils, mix a tea 
spoonful of scorched flour, with a little water, and 
stir it in, put in a little pepper, salt, and quarter of a 



Gravies and Sauces. 17 

tea spoonful of cloves, put in a table spoonful of cur- 
rant jelly, and half a tumbler full of wine, just before 
you take it from the fire. Many people prefer mel- 
ted currant jelly, to any other sauce for venison. 

42. Rice Satice. 

Boil half a tea cup of rice, till soft, then stir in 
two table spoonsful of milk, a little salt, and a nut- 
meg, or mace, sweet herbs, a boiled onion, and strain 
it. This is a very nice accompaniment to game. 

43. Oyster Sauce. 

Take the juice of your oysters, and to a pint put 
a couple of sticks of rnace, a little salt and pepper, 
put it on the fire, when it boils, mix two tea spoons- 
ful of flour, with a little milk, and stir it in. When it 
has boiled two or three minutes, put in about half a 
pint of solid oysters, a piece of butter of the size of 
half an egg, when scalded through take them up, 

44. Liver Sauce for Fish. 

Boil the liver of the fish, then mash it fine, stir it 
into drawn butter, put in a little cayenne or black pep- 
per, a couple of tea spoonsful of lemon juice, and a 
table spoonful of catsup. 

45. Lobster Sauce. 

Mash the yolks of two eggs, boiled soft, with the 
spawn of the lobster, and a lea spoonful of water, 
when rubbed smooth, put in a mustard spoonful of 
made mustard, two table spoonsful of salad oil, or mel- 
ted butter, a little salt, pepper, and five table spoons* 
ful of vinegar. 



18 Gravies and Sauces. 



46. Chicken Salad. 

Boil four eggs three minutes, take them out of the 
shell mash, and mix them, with a couple of table 
spoonsful, of olive oil, or melted butter, two thirds 
of a tumbler of vinegar, a tea spoonful of mixed mus- 
tard, half a tea spoonful of salt, quarter of a.tea spoon- 
ful of pepper, and a little essence of celery, if you 
have any. Cut up a boiled chicken that weighs two 
or three pounds, into small strips, and turn the sauce 
over it. 

47. Sauce for Turtle, or Calf's Head. 

To half a pint of drawn butter, or thickened beef 
gravy, put the juice of half a lemon, a little sage, basil, 
or sweet marjoram, a little cayenne pepper, and a wine 
glass of wbjte wine, just before you take it up. 

48. Apple Sauce. 

Pare and quarter the apples, take out the cores, 
stew them in cider. When soft take them up, put in 
a piece of butter of the size of a walnut, to every 
quart of the sauce, sweeten it to your taste, with brown 
sugar. Another way which is very good, is to boil 
the apples, with a few quinces, in new cider, and mo- 
lasses enough to sweeten them, till reduced to half 
the quantity. This kind of sauce will keep good for 
several months. 

49. Pudding Sauce. 

Mix a tea cup of butter, with two of nice brown 
sugar, when white, put in a wine glass of wine, or 
brandy, flavor it with nutmeg, essence of lemon or 
rosewater. If you wish to have it liquid make two 



Gravies and Sauces. 19 

thirds of a pint of thin starch, and stir it into the but- 1 ' 
ter and sugar. If you wish to have it foam, put in a 
little cider. Cider instead of wine, or brandy, answers 
very well, for common pudding sauce. 

50. Tomato Catsup. 

i 

Wipe the tomatoes, which should be perfectly ripe. 
Boil them till soft in a little water. Strain the whole 
through a sieve, season it highly, with salt, pepper, 
cloves, allspice and mace, then boil it fifteen minutes. 
Let it stand twenty four hours, then take off the wa- 
tery part, bottle the remainder, seal it tight, and keep 
it in a cool place. Made in this way it will keep the 
year round. The catsup, should be stewed in tin, 
and the later in the season it is made, the less liable 
will it be to spoil. 

51. Mushroom Catsup. 

Put a layer of fresh mushrooms, in a deep dish, 
sprinkle a little salt over them, then put in another 
layer of mushrooms, and salt, and so on, till you get 
in all the mushrooms, let them stand several days, 
then mash them fine ; to each quart, put a tea spoon- 
ful, of black pepper, put it in a stone jar tightly cov- 
ered, set it in a pot of boiling water, boil it two hours, 
then strain it without squeezing the mushrooms. Boil 
the juice half an hour, skim it well, let it stand a few 
hours to settle, then turn it off carefully through a 
sieve, bottle, cork, and seal it tight, set it in a cool 
place. 

52. Essence of Celery. 

Steep half an- oz. of bruised celery seed, in a quar- 
ter of a pint of brandy, for a fortnight. A few drops 
of this, will give a fine flavor to soup. 



20 Soups. 

53. Soup Herb Spirit. 

- Those who like a variety of herbs, in soup, will 
find it very convenient, to have the following mixture. 
Take when in their prime, thyme, sweet marjoram, 
sweet basil, and summer savory, dry, pound, and sift 
them, steep them in brandy. The herb spirit will be 
fit for use, in the course of a fortnight. 

54. Veal Soup. 

A leg of veal, after enough has been cut off for cut- 
lets, makes a soup nearly as good as calves head. 
Boil it with a cup two thirds full of rice, a pound and 
a half of pork, season it with salt, pepper, and sweet 
herbs, if you like, a little boiled celery cut in slices, or 
a little essence of celery improves it, parsly, carrot, and 
onions, boiled in the soup, are liked by some people. 

If you wish for balls in your soup, chop veal fine, 
mix it with a couple of eggs, a few bread crumbs, a 
small piece of butter, or raw pork chopped fine, put 
in salt and pepper, to your taste, or a little curry 
powder, boil them in the soup. Just before you take 
the soup up, put in a couple of slices of toast, cut into 
small pieces. The veal should be taken up before 
the soup is seasoned. 

55. Black Soup. 

The shank of beef, is the best part for soup, cold 
roast beef bones, and beef steak, make very good 
soup. Boil the shank four or five hours, in water 
enough to cover it. Half an hour before the soup 
goes on the table, take out the meat, thicken the soup 
with scorched flour mixed with cold water, season it 
with pepper, salt, nutmeg, and cloves, a little tomato 
catsup improves it, put in sweet herbs or herb spirit if 
you like. 



Soups. 

Some people boil onions in the soup, but as they 
are very disagreeable to many persons, it is better to 
boil them and put them in a dish by themselves. Take 
bread soaked soft, mash it well and put in a little of 
the boiled beef chopped fine, a couple of eggs, a very 
little flour, season it highly with salt, pepper, cloves, 
and mace, do it up in small balls and boil them in the 
soup fifteen minutes. 

56. Cays Head or mock Turtle Soup. 

Boil the head till perfectly tender, then take it out, 
strain the liquor, and set it away till the next day, then 
skim off the grease. Cut up the meat, and put it in 
the liquor, together with the lights, (the brains should 
be reserved for the balls) warm it, and season it with 
salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and sweet herbs if you like 
and onions, let it stew gently for half an hour. Just 
before taking it up add half a pint of white wine. For 
the balls chop lean veal fine, with a small piece of raw 
salt pork, add the brains, and season it highly with 
salt, pepper, cloves, mace, and sweet herbs, or curry 
powder, make it up into balls, about the size of half a 
hen's egg, boil part in the soup, and fry the remainder, 
and put them in a dish by themselves. 

57. Chicken or Turkey Soup. 

The liquor that turkey or chicken is boiled in 
makes a good soup, with half a tea cup of rice, and a 
a Ib. of pork boiled in it. If you do not like it very 
fat, let it stand till the next day after the turkey is boil- 
ed, skim off the fat, season it with salt, pepper, and 
sweet herbs. If you like vegetables in soup, boil them 
by themselves, slice them up when done and put 
them in the turreen with toasted bread, cut in small 
pieces ; or toasted crackers. When the soup is hot, 
turn it on them. 



Soups. 

58. Oyster Soup. 

Take a couple of quarts of oysters out of the liquor 
with a fork, strain the liquor, and if there are any 
shells in them rinse them off. To each quart put a 
pint of milk or water. Set them on the fire, when it 
begins to simmer skim it, mix three tea spoonsful of 
flour, with a little milk, stir it in when the oysters boil, 
when it boils again take it up and season it with salt, 
pepper, a table spoonful of tomato catsup, a table 
spoonful of vinegar and a small lump of butter ; turn it 
on to a slice of toast cut in pieces. 

59. Pea Soup. 

To a quart of peas, put a quart of cold water soak 
them over night, in a warm place. Next day set them 
to boiling four or five hours, before they are to be ea- 
ten, put in a couple of Ibs. of pork to two quarts of 
the peas, add in a little more water, if not likely to be 
sufficiently soft, put in a tea spoonful of saleratus half 
an hour before you take up the soup. 

60. To Bake Beans. 

Pick over the beans, wash, and put them in a pot 
with cold water enough to cover them, hang them 
over the fire where they will keep just lukewarm. 
When they begin to grow soft, stew them over a hot 
fire several minutes, with a heaping tea spoonful of sal- 
eratus. Then take them up with a skimmer, and put 
them in a baking pot, gash a Ib. of pork and put it down 
in the pot so as to have the beans just cover it, pour in 
cold water till you can see it at the top. They will 
bake in a hot oven in the course of three hours ; but 
they will be better to remain in it five or six. Beans 
are very good stewed, without being baked. 



Soups. 23 

61. Poached Eggs. 

Break your eggs into a dish and beat them to a 
foam. Then put them on a few coals, put in a small 
lump of butter, a little salt, let them cook very slow- 
ly, stirring them constantly till they become quite 
thick, then take them up, and turn them on buttered 
toast. 

62. To Boil Eggs. 

They should be put into boiling water, and if you 
wish to have them soft, three minutes is long enough 
to boil them, if you wish to have them hard, they 
should boil five minutes. Another way to boil them, 
is to break the shells and drop the eggs, into a frying 
pan of boiling water, let them boil three or four min- 
utes. If you do not use the figs, as a garnish, salt 
and butter them, when you take them up. 

63. Omelet. 

Bent your eggs to a froth, leaving out half the 
whites, put in a couple of ounces, of fine minced ham, 
corned beef or veal, when veal is used, a little salt 
will be requisite. Fry it in butter, till it begins to 
thicken. When it is brown on the underside, it is 
sufficiently cooked. If you wish to have it brown on 
the top, put a heated bake pan lid over it, as soon as 
it has set. 

64. Fresh Fish. 

Fresh fish for boiling, or broiling, are the best the 
day after they are caught. They should be cleaned, 
washed, and half a tea cup of salt, sprinkled on the 
inside of them, and a little pepper, if they are to be 



24 Fish. 

broiled. Set them in a cool place. When fresh fish 
are boiled, they should be put in a strainer, or sewed up 
in a cloth carefully ; put them in cold water, with 
the backbone down ; with eight or ten pounds of fish, 
boil half a tea cup of salt. Many people do not put 
their fish into the pot, until the water boils, but it is 
not a good plan, as the outside gets cooked too much, 
before the inside is cooked sufficiently. Fish for 
frying, should be wiped dry after being washed, and 
flour sprinkled on them. For five or six Ibs. of fish, 
fry three or four slices of pork, when brown, take 
them up, and put in the fish, if the pork does not 
make sufficient fat, to fry the fish in, add a little lard. 
For good plain gravy, mix a tea spoonful or two of flour 
with a little water, and turn in, when you have taken 
up the fish ; when well mixed, add a little butter and 
pepper, when it boils, turn it on to the fish. Boiled 
fish, should be served up with drawn butter, or liver 
sauce. For a garnish to boiled fish, boil several eggs 
five minutes, cool them in water, then take off the 
shells, and cut them in slices, and lay them round the 
fish ; parsly and pepper grass, are also a pretty gar- 
nish for boiled fish. For broiling fish the gridiron 
should be greased with a little butter, the inside of the 
fish should be broiled first. 

65. Fresh Cod, 

Is good boiled, fried, baked, or made into a chow- 
der. It is too dry a fish to broil. 

66. Halibut, 

Is nice cut in slices, and broiled or fried ; the fins 
and the thick part, are good boiled. 

67. Striped and Sea Bass, 

Are good fried, boiled, broiled, baked or made 
into a chowder. 



Fish. 25 

65. Black Fish. 

Black fish are the best fried, or boiled, they will 
do to broil but are not so nice as cooked in any other 
way. 

69. Shad. 

Fresh shad are the best bloated and broiled ; but 
they are good boiled or fried, the spawn and liver 
are nice fried in lard. Salt shad is good boiled, with- 
out any soaking, if liked quite salt, if not pour on scald- 
ing water, and let them soak in it, half an hour, then 
drain off the water, and boil them twenty minutes, 
Salt shad and mackerel for broiling, should be soak- 
ed twenty four hours, in cold water, the water should 
be changed several times. To salt twenty five shad, 
mix one pound of sugar, a peck of rock salt, two 
quarts of fine salt, and quarter of a pound of salt 
petre. Put a layer of it at the bottom of the keg, 
then a layer of shad, with the skin side down, sprinkle 
on the mixed salt, sugar, and salt petre, and so on 
till you get in all the shad. Lay a heavy weight on 
the shad, to keep it under brine. If there is not 
brine enough in the course of a week, add a little more 
sugar, salt, and salt petre. 

70. Chowder. 

Fry three or four slices of pork until brown. Cut 
each of your fish into five or six slices, flour and put 
a layer of them in your pork fat, sprinkle on pepper 
and very little salt, cloves, and mace, if you like, lay 
on several crackers, previously soaked soft, in cold 
water, and several bits of your fried pork, this operation 
repeat, till you get in all your fish, then turn on nearly 
water enough to cover them, put on a heated bake pan

lid. When the fish has stewed about twenty minutes, 
take them up, and mix a tea spoonful of flour, with a 
little water, and stir it into the gravy, add about an ounce 
of butter, and cloves. Half a pint of white wine, and 
the juice of half a lemon, or a tea cup of tomato cat- 
sup, improve it. Bass and Cod, make the best chow- 
der. Some people like them made of clams, the 
hard part should be cut off. 

71. Stuffed and Baked Fish. 

Soak bread in cold water, till soft, then squeeze out 
all the water, mash it and mix it with a piece of but- 
ter, of the size of a hen's egg, a little salt, pepper, 
cloves, and mace, a couple of raw eggs, makes the 
dressing cut smoother. Fill the fish with this dressing, 
and sew it up. Put a tea cup of water in a bake pan, 
and a small piece of butter, lay in the fish ; bake it 
about an hour. Fresh cod, bass, and shad, are suita- 
ble fish for baking. 

72. Salt Cod, 

Should be soaked in lukewarm water, till the skin 
will come off easily. Scrape it, and change the wa- 
ter, and put it over a moderate fire, where it will keep 
warm without boiling, boiling hardens rather than 
softens it. It takes three hours to soak it soft. It 
should be cut into good square pieces, and served up 
with drawn butter. Cold codfish is good, minced up 
fine, with potatoes, and warmed up with butter, and a 
little water. 

73. Fish Cakes. 

Cold, boiled, salt, or fresh fish, are nice mixed up 
fine, with potatoes, a little butter put in, and moulded 
up, into small cakes, with the hand, fry them in pork 
fat, or butter. 



Fish. 27 



74. Lobsters and Crabs. 

Put them into boiling water, and boil them three 
quarters of an hour, if large, if not, half an hour will 
be long enough. Boil two thirds of a tea cup of salt, 
with four or five pounds of lobsters. When cold 
crack the shells, take out the meat. Be careful to 
get out the blue vein, and what is called the lady, as 
they are very unhealthy. 

Lobsters are good cold, or warmed up, with a little 
vinegar, pepper, salt, and butter. A way of dress- 
ing them, which looks very prettily, is to pick out the 
spawn, and red chord, mash it fine, and rub it through 
the sieve, put in a little butter and salt, cut the lobsters 
into small squares, and warm it together with the 
spawn, over a moderate fire. When hot take it up, 
and garnish it with parsly. The chord and spawn 
'when strained, are a handsome garnish for any kind of 
boiled fish. 

75. Scollops. 

Are nice fried, or boiled and pickled like oysters, 
for frying, they should be previously boiled, and taken 
out of the shells, and all but the hearts thrown away, 
as the rest is very unhealthy, dip the hearts, into flour, 
and fry them till brown in lard. The hearts are also 
good stewed with a little water, butter, pepper, and 
salt. 

76. Eels. 

If very large, are best, bloated and broiled, they 
should be bloated several hours before cooking them. 
If not very large fry them in pork fat; large eels are 
nice cut into small strips, and laid in a deep dish, with 
bits of salt pork and pepper, and baked for half an 
hour. 



28 Fish. 



77. Clams. 

Wash and boil them, until the shells open, with just 
water enough to prevent their burning at the bottom 
of the pot. When the shells open, take the clams out 
of them, and warm them, with a little of the liquor, 
they were boiled in, and a little butter, pepper, and 
salt. Soak a slice of toasted bread, in the clam li- 
quor, put it in the bottom of a dish and turn the clams 
on to it when hot. For clam pancakes, take some of 
the clam liquor, and mix with a little flour, to a pint of 
flour put two beaten eggs, and a little salt, fry them in 
lard. Very large long clams are nice taken out of 
the shell without boiling and broiled. 

78. Stew Oysters. 

Take the oysters out of the liquor with a fork, rinse 
the bits of shell from them, and strain the liquor, put 
the oysters in a stew pan, with the juice, when scald- 
ed through, take them up, turn them on buttered toast, 
salt, butter, and pepper them, to your taste, some 
cooks add a little catsup or lemon juice. 

79. To Fry Oysters. 

Take those that are large, dip them in eggs, and 
fine bread crumbs, fry them in lard, till of a light 
brown. They are a nice garnish for boiled or fried 
fish, if fried when first caught with a little salt, and 
pepper, sprinkled on them, will keep good several 
months, provided they are put into a bottle and cork- 
ed tight, as soon as cooked. Whenever they are to 
be eaten, warm them with a little water. 

80. Oyster Pancakes. 

Mix the juice of the oysters, with flour, in the pro- 
portion of a pint of liquor, to a pint of flour, if you 



Fish. Vegetables. 29 

have not juice enough, put in a little milk, or water, 
add a couple of eggs, and a little salt to each pint, fry 
them in lard. 

81. Oyster Pie. 

Line a deep dish with pie crust, fill it with dry pie- 
ces of bread ; make a nice puff paste, and cover the 
dish with it, bake till of a light brown, either in a quick 
oven or bake pan, have the oysters just stewed, by the 
time the crust is done, take off the upper crust, and 
remove the pieces of bread, put in the oysters, season 
them with salt, pepper, and butter, a little catsup im- 
proves the pie, but is not essential, cover it with the 
crust. 

82. Scolloped Oysters. 

Pound crackers or rusked bread till fine, butter 
scolloped tins or shell, sprinkle on the crumbs, then 
put in a layer of oysters, a small lump of butter, a lit- 
tle pepper, salt, and juice of the oysters, put on anoth- 
er layer of crumbs, and oysters, and so on till the 
shells are filled, having the bread crumbs on top; 
bake them until a light brown. 

83. Vegetables. Potatoes. 

O 

The best way to cook potatoes, is to pare and put 
them in a pot, with just boiling water enough to prevent 
their burning, put in a little salt, and cover them up 
tight, let them stew till you can stick a fork through 
them easily. If there is any water in the pot turn it 
off, and put it back on the fire, and let the potatoes 
steam a few moments longer. The easiest way to 
cook them, is to put them in boiling water, with the 
skins on, they should boil constantly till done, if you 
wish to have them mealy ; they are more mealy, to 
have the water turned off, as soon as you can stick a 

3* 



30 Vegetables. 

fork through them easily, and put in a warm place, 
where they will steam, the lid should be off. Cold, 
mashed, or whole potatoes are nice cut in slices, and 
fried in lard or butter. Sweet potatoes are the best 
baked. Most potatoes will boil sufficiently in half an 
hour, new Irish potatoes will boil in less time. 

84. Turnips. 

White turnips require about as much boiling, as po- 
tatoes. When tender take them up, peel and mash 
them, season them with a little salt and butter. Yel- 
low turnips require about two hours boiling, if very 
large, they should be split in two. 

85. Beets. 

Beets should not be cut, or scraped before they 
are boiled. In summer they will boil in an hour, in 
winter it takes three hours to boil them tender. Boil- 
ed beets cut in slices, and put in vinegar, for several 
days, are nice. 

86. Parsnips and Carrots. 

The best way to cook them, is to scrape and split 
them in two, put them in a stew pan with the flat side 
down, pour on boiling water enough to cover them, 
when done take them up, and butter them. Many 
people boil parsnips whole, but it is not a good plan, 
as the outside gets done too much, before the inside is 
cooked sufficiently. 

87. Onions. 

Peel and put them in boiling milk, water will do to 
boil them in but is not as good, when done take them 
up salt them, and turn a little melted butter, over 
them. 



Vegetables. 31 



88. Artichokes. 

Scrape and put them in boiling water with a table 
spoonful of salt, to a couple of dozen, when boiled 
tender (which will be in about two hours) take them 
up and butter them. 

89. Squashes. 

If very young boil them whole, if not they should 
be pared quartered and the seeds taken out, boil them 
till very tender, then take them up, put them in a 
cloth, and press out the water, mash them in a dish, 
salt and butter them to your taste. 

90. Cabbage. 

Take off the loose leaves, cut the stalky part in 
quarters, to the heart of the cabbage. Boil it an 
hour, if not boiled with corn beef put a little salt in 
the pot. Cauliflowers will boil tender in fifteen or 
twenty minutes. 

91. Asparagus. 

The tough part should be cut in thin slices, and 
boiled eight or ten minutes, before the other part is 
put in, lay the remainder compactly together, tie it in 
small bundles and boil it from fifteen to twenty min- 
utes, according to its age. Take it up when tender, 
with a skimmer lay it on buttered toast, in a deep dish, 
sprinkle a little salt on it, melt a little butter, and turn 
over it. 

92. Peas. 

Shell and boil them, from fifteen to thirty minutes, 
according to their age, and kind, if very old a tea 



32 Vegetables* 

spoonful of saleratus boiled with them, makes them 
better and more healthy. When tender take them up 
salt and butter them to your taste. 

93. Beans. 

String beans, should have the strings carefully ta- 
ken off and if old, the edges should be cutoff; if the 
beans are old put saleratus in the pot, in the propor- 
tion of half a tea spoonful of saleratus, to a peck of 
beans it should be put in before the beans. Boil 
them from twenty five to thirty minutes, salt and but- 
ter them when you take them up. Beans and all oth- 
er summer vegetables, should not be picked longer 
than one day before being cooked ; the fresher green 
vegetables are the belter they are and more healthy. 

94. Corn, 

Should be put in boiling water with a little salt, and 
boiled from ten to twenty minutes, according to its age, 
It is much sweeter to be boiled on the cob. 

95. Greens. 

White mustard, spinach and the leaves and roots 
of very small beets, are the best greens. Boil them 
with a little salt and saleratus in the water. 

96. Salads, 

Should be fresh, and put in cold water, for half an 
hour before they are eaten. Cucumbers, to be healthy, 
should not be picked longer than a day before they 
are eaten, they should be kept in cold water, and fif- 
teen or twenty minutes before they are eaten, pare 
and slice them, into fresh cold water. 



T^egetables. o3 

97. To Steiv Mushrooms. 

Peel and put them in a sauce pan, with just enough 
water, to prevent their burning to the bottom of the 
pan. Put in a little salt, and shake them occasionally. 
When they have stewed about twenty minutes, put in 
-a little butter, pepper, and salt ; a liule wine and 
cloves improve them. They should be stewed very 
slowly, and taken up as soon as seasoned, turn them 
on buttered toast. 

98. Egg Plant, 

Should be cut in slices, about half an inch thick, be- 
tween every slice sprinkle a little salt, let them lay two 
hours before cooking, then scrape off the salt and fry 
them till brown in lard. 

99. Celeriac. 

This is an excellent vegetable, but it is but little 
known. The stalks of it, can hardly be distinguished 
from celery, and it is much easier cultivated. The 
roots are nice boiled tender, and cut in thin slices and 
put in soup, or meat pie, or cooked in the following 
manner, and eaten with meat. Scrape and cut them 
in slices, and boil them, till perfectly tender, then take 
them up sprinkle on a little salt and stew them in a 
little milk four or five minutes, turn them into a dish, 
and put in a little butter, 

100. Salsify or Vegetable Oyster. 

The best way too cook it, is to cut it in slices, and 
dip it into an egg and fine bread crumbs, fry it in lard. 
It is very good boiled, and then stewed a few moments 
in milk, and a little butter put on it, or cut in slices, 
and fried in butter, made like that for oyster pan- 
cakes, substituting milk for the juice of the oyster. 



34 



101. Tomatoes, 

If very ripe will skin easily, if not pour on scald- 
ing water, and let them remain in it four or five min- 
utes. Peel and put them in a stew pan with a ta- 
ble spoonful of water if not very juicy, if so no water 
will be required, put in a little salt, and stew them in tin, 
for half an hour, when done turn them into a djsh with 
buttered toast. Another way of cooking them, which 
is considered very nice by epicures, is to put them in a 
deep dish, with powdered bread crumbs, or crackers, 
a layer of each alternately, sprinkle salt, and pepper, 
on each layer, and put on small bits of butter, over 
each layer, some people like a little nutmeg and su- 
gar. Have a layer of bread crumbs on the top, and 
bake it, in a bake pan three quarters of an hour. 

102. Gumb. 

Take an equal quantity of young tender okra chop- 
ped fine, and ripe tomatoes skinned, an onion shred- 
ded fine, a small lump of butter, a little salt and 
pepper, put the whole in a stew pan, with a table 
spoonful of water, and stew it till tender. 

103. Southern Manner of Cooking Rice. 

Pick over the rice, and wash it in cold water, put 
it in three quarts of boiling water with half a tea spoon- 
ful of salt, to a pint of the rice. Boil it seventeen 
minutes, then turn off the water very close, put it over 
a moderate fire with the lid of the pot off, let it steam 
fifteen minutes. Rice boiled in this manner is supe- 
rior to any other ; but care must be taken to be exact 
in the time of boiling and steaming, as a few moments 
variation makes a great deal of differencewith it, the 
water should boil when it is put in the pot, and not

allowed to stop boiling till done. The water that the 
rice is cooked in makes nice starch if boiled a few 
moments by itself. 

104. To Pickle Peppers. 

i 

If you do not like them fiery, take out the seeds, 
they should be taken out carefully with a penknife, so 
as not to mangle the pepper. Soak them in salt and 
water, eight or nine days, change the water each day, 
and keep them in a warm place. If you like them 
stuffed, put in cinnamon, cloves, mace, and nasturtions, 
lay them in cold spiced vinegar. Tomatoes when 
very small, and green, are good pickled with the pep- 
pers. 

i 

105. Mangoes. 

Procure muskmelons as late in the season as 
possible, and those that are very green; if pickled ear- 
ly, they are api to spoil. Take out the seeds, and 
soak them in salt and water, three or four days. Then 
take them out of the water, sprinkle powdered cloves, 
and nutmeg, round on the inside of the melon, fill 
them with strips of horseradish, cinnamon, smalTstring 
beans, or flag root, nasturtion, and radish tops, fill the 
crevices, with American mustard seed; put on the 
covers, and sew each one up in a bag. Lay the mel- 
ons in a stone jar, with the side that the covers are 
on up ; turn on scalding hot vinegar, with alum, pep- 
per corns, and salt in it. Pickled barberries are a 
pretty garnish for them. 

106. To Pickle Butternuts and Walnuts. 

The nuts for pickling should be picked as early as 
the first of July unless the season is very backward, if a 
pin will go through them easily, they are in a right state 
for pickling. Soak them in salt and water, a week, 



36 Pickles. 

then drain, and scrape or rub them, with a cloth, 
sprinkle them with ground cloves, and pour on boiling 
vinegar, spiced with cloves, pepper corns, allspice, 
and mace, add a little salt. They will be fit to eat in 
the course of a fortnight, or three weeks. The vin- 
egar they are pickled in, makes a nice catsup, if boil- 
ed down to half the quantity, and a little more spice 
added. 

107. To Pickle Cabbage, and Cauliflower. 

Purple cabbages are the best for pickling. Pull off 
the loose leaves and quarter them, sprinkle salt on 
the flat side of each one, let them lay several days, 
then rinse off the salt and drain them; sprinkle 
on powdered cloves, mace, salt, and pour on scalding 
vinegar, with a few peppers in it, alum and pepper 
corns. Cauliflowers are pickled in the same manner 
as the cabbages. They will be fit to eat in the course 
of a fortnight, after being pickled. 

108. To Pickle Onions. 

Peel and boil them, in milk and water, a few min- 
utes. Put cloves, cinnamon, mace, and salt, in vine- 
gar, and heat the vinegar scalding hot in brass. Take 
the onions out of the milk and water, drain them, 
then turn on the vinegar scalding hot, with two ounces 
of alum to each pailful of vinegar. Cover them tight 
until cold. 

109. To Pickle Artichokes. 

Soak the artichokes in salt and water, a week, then 
drain and rub them, till you get all the skin ofT, turn 
boiling vinegar on them, spiced with pepper corns and 
mace, add salt and alum. Let them remain a week, 
then tiirn off the vinegar, scald it, and turn it back, 



Pickles. 37 

while hot on to the artichokes. Continue to scald the 
vinegar, at intervals of a week or ten days, until the 
vinegar appears to have entered the artichokes. 

110. To Pickle Cucumbers. 

Pour boiling water on them, when first picked 5 and 
let them lay in it eight or ten hours, then put them in 
cold vinegar, with alum and salt, in the proportion of 
quarter of a pound of the first, and a pint of the last, 
to every half barrel of pickles. When you have done 
picking your cucumbers for pickling, turn the vinegar 
from them, boil and skim it till clear, throw in the cu- 
cumbers, and let them boil a few moments, then put 
them in fresh cold vinegar, with salt and alum : a few 
peppers improve them. Whenever any scum rises 
on any kind of pickles turn off the vinegar, scald and 
skim it, turn it back when cold on the pickles. Pick- 
les of all kinds should be stirred up occasionally, and 
if there are any soft ones among them, they should be 
thrown away, and the vinegar scalded ; if very weak, 
it should be thrown away and fresh added. The vin- 
egar when scalded, should not be allowed to cool in 
brass. Another method of pickling cucumbers, which 
is very good, is to put them in salt and water, as you 
pick them, change the water once in three days ; when 
you have done picking your cucumbers, take them 
out of the salt and water, and put them in cold vine- 
gar, with alum, salt, and pepper corns in it. 

111. To Pickle Gherkins. 

Put them in strong brine, keep them in a warm 
place, when they turn yellow, drain off the brine, and 
turn hot vinegar on them, let them remain in it near 
the fire till they turn green, turn off the vinegar, and 
pour on fresh hot vinegar, spiced with pepper corns, 
mace, cloves, and cinnamon ; add salt and alum in the

same proportions as for cucumbers. These, as well 
as all other pickles, should not be kept in glazed 
earthen jars. 

112. Oystens. 

Take the oysters from the liquor, strain and boil it, 
then put in the oysters, let them boil one minute, take 
them out, and to the liquor, put a few pepper corns, 
cloves, a little mace, and the same quantity of vinegar 
as oyster juice, boil it fifteen minutes ; when cold turn 
it on to the oysters. Bottle and cork them tight. 

113. Mushrooms. 

Peel and stew them, with just water enough, to 
prevent their sticking to the bottom of the stew pan, 
shake them occasionally, to prevent their burning. 
When tender take them up, and put them in scalding 
vinegar, spiced with mace, cloves, and pepper corns, 
add a little salt, bottle and cork them up. 

114. Wheat Bread. 

For six common sized loaves of bread, take three 
pints of boiling water, and mix with five quarts of 
flour; when thoroughly mixed, add three pints of cold 
water, stir it till the whole of the dough is equally 
cold; when lukewarm stir in half a pint of yeast, a ta- 
ble spoonful of salt, knead in flour till stiff enough to 
mould up, cover it over and if the weather is cold set 
it near the fire to rise. To ascertain when it is risen, 
rut it through the middle with a knife, and if full of 
small holes like a sponge, it is sufficiently light. If 
the dough gets sour before you are ready to bake it, 
dissolve two or more tea spoonsful of saleratus (accor- 
ding to the acidity of it,) in a cup of water, and strain it 
on ihe dough, work it in well, mould it up, slash it on 



Bread. 39 

th? skies, to prevent its cracking when baked, put it 
in buttered pans, and let it stand ten or twelve min- 
utes before you bake it; if you like it quite brown let 
it stand in the oven an hour and a half. If the wheat 
is grown, use all boiling water, and let it stand till cool 
before putting in the yeast. Some people, have an 
idea that it kills the life of the flour, to scald it, but it 
is a mistake, it makes it much sweeter, and prevents 
its moulding soon in warm weather; bread made in 
this manner is very nearly as good as that which is 
wet with milk. Care must be taken, not to put in the 
yeast when the dough is hot, as it will scald it and 
prevent its rising. Bread is much better in the win- 
ter, -for being made several days before it is baked, 
it should be kept in a cool place, and a little flour 
knead in every day. Most ovens require heating an 
hour and a half for bread, some will heat sufficiently 
in an hour, a brisk fire should be kept up, the doors 
in the room should be kept shut in cold weather. 
Pine, and ash, or birch mixed, are the best wood for 
heating an oven. To ascertain if your oven is of the 
right temperature, when cleared throw in a little flour, 
if it browns in the course of a minute, it is hot enough, 
if it turns black wait several minutes before you put 
in your things, if not hot enough, set in a furnace of 
live coals, after you have put your things in. 

115. Sponge Bread. 

For four loaves of bread, take three quarts of boil- 
ing water and turn it into three quarts of flour. When 
lukewarm put in a cup of yeast, a table spoonful of 
salt, set it in a warm place to rise, when light knead in 
flour till stiff enough to mould up, then let it stand till 
risen again, before moulding it up. 

116. Rye Bread. 

Wet up the rye flour with lukewarm milk, if you 
have it ; if not water will do, and the same proportion 



40 Bread. Yeast. 

of yeast as for wheat flour ; put in a small piece of but- 
ter and a little salt. It should not be kneaded as stiff 
as wheat flour, as it will be hard when baked ; let it 
stand in the pans, after it is moulded up, half an hour. 
Brown Bread is made by mixing, Indian meal and 
Rye flour. The Indian meal should be scalded ; 
when cool, put in the rest of the ingredients, in the 
same proportion as for plain rye bread. Bake it be- 
tween two and three hours. 

117. Rice Bread. 

Boil a pint of rice till soft, then mix it with two 
quarts of rice flour, a tea cup of yeast, two tea spoons- 
ful of salt, and milk enough to render it of the con- 
sistency of rye bread-. When light bake it in small 
loaves. 

113. French Rolls, or Twists. 

Turn a pint of lukewarm milk, into a pint of flour, 
mix them well together, then turn in a small tea cup 
of yeast, two tea spoonsful of salt, and flour enough 
to make a thick batter. Set it in a warm place to 
rise. When light, put in a piece of butter of the size 
of a hen's egg, and half a tea cup of lukewarm water, 
the butter should be melted before it is put in ; knead 
in flour until stiff enough to roll out. Let it stand till 
risen again, then roll it out, about half an inch thick, 
cut it into narrow strips, braid and twist them a little, as 
you braid them. Lay them on flat buttered tins, let 
them remain from twenty to thirty minutes, then bake 
them slowly. 

119. Yeast. 

Boil a small handful of hops, in two quarts of wa- 
ter, when ?il the strength is obtained from them, strain 



Yeast. ^ f 

the liquor, and put it back on the fire, take a little of 
it, and mix smoothly with a couple of tahle spoonsful 
of flour, mix it with the boiling liquor, when it has 
boiled five or six minutes, take it from the fire, and 
when lukewarm, add a tea cup of yeast, keep it in a 
warm place till risen, then stir in a table spoonful of 
salt, turn it into ajar, and cover it up tight. Some 
people keep yeast in bottles but they are very apt to 
burst. Yeast made in this manner, will keep a fort- 
night in the warmest weaiher. If your yeast appears 
to be sour, put a little salerams in just before you put 
it into your bread ; if it docs not loam well, it is loo 
stale to use. Another method of raising bread, which 
is very good, is to leave about half a pound of dough, 
from one week's baking to another. It should be roll- 
ed out thin and dried in the sun", about two hours be- 
fore you wish to bake your bread, turn a quart ol 
warm water to it, and set it mrar the fire till lighl, 
which will be in the course of an hour, then scald your 
dough, and when lukewarm, slir in the yeast; it will 
raise the bread in the course of an hour. This can 
only be used two or three times, without iiaving fresh 
yeast put to it. 

120. Yeast Cakes. 
- 

Slir into a pint of yeast, a table spoonful of salt, and 
Indian meal sufficient to enable you to roll it out. 
When rolled thin, cut it into cakes will) a tumbler, 
and dry them in the wind ; in hot weather, care must 
be taken to keep them from the sun, or they will fer- 
ment ; when perfectly dry, tie them up in a bag, and 
keep them in a cool dry place. To raise four or five 
loaves of bread, take one of these cakes, and put it in 
half a pint of warm water, set it near the fire to rise, 
when light use it to raise your dough. 



42 Biscuit. 

121. Biscuit. 

Melt a cup of butter, and mix it with half a pint of 
lukewarm milk ; if you have not milk, water will do, 
add a tea cup of yeast, two tea spoonsful of salt, and 
flour to render it sufficiently stiff to roll out. Set it in. 
a warm place, when light, roll it out about an inch 
thick, cut it with a tumbler into cakes and let them 
stand half an hour before baking them. 

122. Butter Milk Biscuit. 

Dissolve a couple of tea spoonsful of saleratus, in a. 
tea cup of milk, sour is the best. Mix it with a pint 
of buttermilk, three tea spoonsful of salt ; a little cream 
improves it; knead in flour till stiff enough to roll out.. 
Mould it into small cakes, and bake them directly. 

123. Hard Biscuit. 

Weigh out four pounds of sifted flour; takeout 
about a quarter of a pound of it, rub the remainder 
with four ounces of butter, two tea spoonsful of salt, 
and four eggs. Wet up the whole with milk, pound it 
out flat with a rolling pin, sprinkle a little of the re- 
served flour over it lightly, roll it up and pound it out 
thin again, sprinkle on more of the flour, roll it up, this 
operation continue to repeat, until you get in all the 
reserved flour. Then mould it up into small cakes, 
lay them on flat buttered tins, flatten and cover them, 
with a damp cloth as you lay them on the tins, to pre- 
vent their drying too fust. Bake them in a quick oven. 

124. York Biscuit. 

Rub together six ounces of butter, two pounds and 
three quarters of flour, dissolve a couple of tea spoons- 
ful of saleratus in a little milk, and mix it with the 






Hot Cakes. 

flour, add a tea spoonful of salt, and milk sufficient to 
enable you to roll it out. Pound it out thin and cut is 
into cakes, bake them till a light brown. 

125. Rice Cakes. 

Mix a pint of soft boiled rice, with a pint of milk, 
or water, a tea spoonful of salt and a couple of beaten 
eggs. Stir in rice or wheat flour, till of the right con- 
sistency to roll out. Cut them into cakes and bake 
them. 

126. Rice Ruffs'. 

To a pint of rice flour, put a pint of boiling water, 
a tea spoonful of salt, and four eggs, beaten to a froth. 
Drop this mixture into boiling fat, by large spoonsful. 

127. Buck Wheat Cakes. 

Mix a quart of buck wheat flour, with a pint and a 
half of warm milk, (water will do but is not quite as 
good) and a tea cup of yeast, then set it in a worm 
place to rise. When light (which will be in the course 
often or twelve hours,) add a tea spoonful of salt, if 
sour the same quantity of saleratus, dissolved in milk, 
and strained, thin them with a little milk. Fry them in 
just fat enough to prevent their sticking to the griddle 
or pan. Salt pork rinds, beef fat,, or lard, are good to 
fry them in. 

128. Economy Cakes. 

Soak dry pieces of bread in water, till soft enough 
to mash fine, squeeze out all the water, and to three 
pints of the bread pulp, put a couple of table spoonsful 
of flour, one beaten egg, half a tea spoonful of salt, 
the same quantity of saleratus, dissolved in a cup of 
milk and strained. If not thin enough stir in a little

more milk. Cook them in the same manner as buck 
wheat cakes. 

129. Green Corn Cakes. 

Mix a pint of grated green corn, with three table 
spoonsful of milk, a tea cup of flour, half a cup of mel- 
ted butter, one egg, a tea spoonful of salt, half a tea 
spoonful of pepper. Drop this mixture by the spoon- 
ful into hot butter, and fry it eight or ten minutes. 
These cakes are nice served up with meat for dinner. 

130. Corn Cake. 

To a quart of milk put three beaten eggs, a tea 
spoonful of salt, mix it with sifted Indian meal enough 
to make a thin batter. Bake it in a bake pan about 
one hour. Buttermilk or sour milk with a tea spoon- 
ful of saleratus, is better to mix with the Indian meal, 
than sweet milk and eggs. 

131. Indian Slap Jacks. 

Mix a quart of milk with a pint of Indian meal, four 
table spoonsful of flour, three beaten eggs, a tea spoon- 
ful of salt. A table spoonful of molasses or a little 
stewed pumpkin is thought by many people to improve 
them. Fry them in lard. Another way which is 
very good, is to scald a quart of Indian rneal and half 
a pint of wheat flour with milk, (water will do but is 
not as good) stir in a small tea cup of yeast and set 
them in a warm place to rise. When light fry them, 
in just fat enough to prevent their sticking to the grid- 
dle. 

132. Johnny Cakes. 

Scald sifte.I Indian meal, put in a little salt, mould 
it with the hand into cakes, of the size of biscuit. In 



* 



Hot Cakes. 45 

order to mould them up, considerable flour must be 
rubbed on the hands. Fry them in fat enough to 
cover them. When cooked split and butter them. 

133. Hoe Cakes. 

Stir up Indian meal, with cold water sufficient to 
make a batter, of the consistency of buck wheat cakes, 
add a tea spoonful of salt, a table spoonful of melted 
butter. Butter your bakepan and turn this mixture in- 
to it and bake it about an hour. Indian meal wet up 
in this manner is good fried. 

134. Muffins. 

Mix a pint of lukewarm milk, with the same quan- 
tity of flour, a tea spoonful of 'salt, a piece of butter, 
of the size of a hen's egg. When light beat a couple 
of eggs and put in ; butter muffin rings, and put them 
in a buttered pie pan, turn in the mixture and bake 
them till of a light brown* 

135. Flour Waffles. 

Gradually turn a quart of milk or water on to a quart 
of flour, stirring it well as you turn it in, so that it may 
not be lumpy, add a tea cup of yeast, a tea spoonful 
of salt, a table spoonful of melted butter, a couple of 
eggs, improve them, but they can -be dispensed with 
very well. When light bake them in waffle irons, well 
heated and greased with lard, before each one is 
poured in. Bake them on hot coals ; when they have 
been on the fire about two minutes, turn the irons, and 
let them brown on the other side.

spoonful of salt and a table spoonful of melted butter. 
They are cooked in the same manner as other vvaffies. 
A quarter of a pound of sugar, stirred into the mixture 
improves it. 

137. Rice Waffles. 

Mix a quart of milk with a tea cup of boiled rice, 
and a pint and a hair of rice or wheat flour. Beat 
three eggs to a froth, and stir in, together with a tea 
spoonful of salt. 

138. Rice Wafers. 

Rub a pound of rice flour, with quarter of a pound 
of butter, put in a little salt, a wine glass of wine, two 
eggs, and milk sufficient to enable you to roll them 
out. When rolled thin, cut them with a wine glass 
into small cakes and bake them. 

139. Observations respecting Sweet Cakes. 

If you wish your cake to be good, it must be made 
of nice materials. The butter, eggs, and flour should 
not be stale, and the sugar should be dry, and of a 
light color. Brown sugar answers for most kinds of 
cakes, if rolled free from lumps, and stirred with 
the butter, until it is a very light color. The flour 
should be sifted arid if damp, it should be dried per- 
fectly, or it will make the cake heavy. Where sifted 
flour for cake is measured, it should be shaken dow r n 
in the measure to be accurate; if there is not flour 
enough in cake, it will not be light. The eggs should 
be beaten to a froth, on a shallow plate, and for very 
nice cake the whites and yolks, should be beaten sep- 
arately. Where saleratus is used, it should be tho- 
roughly dissolved and strained. Raisins for cake, 
should have the seeds taken out. and Zante currants. 




Sweet Cakes. 47 

should be carefully washed and rubbed in a cloth, to 
get out the sticks ; they should be perfectly dried be- 
fore they are put into the cake. All kinds of cake that 
has not yeast in it, should be stirred till it goes into 
the oven. It should not be moved while in the oven, 
if it can be avoided. The quicker most kinds of cake 
are baked, without burning, the better they will be. 
It is impossible to give any exact rules as to the time 
for baking cake, as so much depends on the heat of the 
oven ; it should be narrowly watched and if likely to 
burn covered with a thick paper. To ascertain when 
rich cake is sufficiently baked, stick a clean broom 
splinter through the thickest part, and if none of the 
cake adheres to it, it is baked enough. When cake 
that is baked on flat tins, moves easily on them it is 
sufficiently done. 

140. Gingerbread. 

Melt a piece of butler, of the size of a hen's egg 
and put it with a pint of molasses, stir in a little flour, 
and a heaping table spoonful of ginger. Dissolve a 
large table spoonful of saleratus, in half a pint of water, 
strain and mix it with the rest of the ingredients, to- 
gether with flour enough to enable you to roll it out 
easily. Roll it about half an inch thick, and lay it on 
flat buttered tins ; bake it as soon as rolled out in a 
quick oven a few moments. Gingerbread to be very 
nice, should be made of good molasses, and baked 
very quick. Some people use only a tea spoonful of 
saleratus, to a pint of molasses, but it is much better 
with more, appearing in point of lightness like sponge 
cake. 

141, Soft Gingerbread. 

Melt a cup of butter and mix it with a pint of mo- 
lasses, a table spoonful of ginger and a little flour, dis- 



48. Sweet Cakes. 

solve three tea spoonsful of saleratus, in a tea cup of 
water, and stir it into the cake, together with flour 
enough to render it of the consistency of pound cake. 
Bake it in deep cake pans, about thirty minutes. A 
couple of eggs improve the cake. 

142. Ginger Snaps. 

Mix half a tea cup of melted butter, with a tea cup 
of sugar, half a tea cup of molasses, and a table spoon- 
ful of ginger. Dissolve a tea spoonful of saleralus, in 
half a tea cup of water and strain it into the cake, knead 
in flour till quite stiff. Roll it out very thin, and cut 
it into cakes, with a wine glass. Lay them on butter- 
ed tins, and bake them a few moments, in a very mod- 
erate oven. A tea spoonful of allspice, .the same 
quantity of cinnamon, mace, and coriander seed, to- 
gether with a tea spoonful of ginger instead of a table 
spoonful, put into this cake will convert it into spice 
snaps. 

143. Cider Cake. 

Rub together three quarters of a pound of sugar, 
and half a pound of butter. Dissolve two tea spoons- 
ful of saleratus in half a tea cup of water, turn it into 
the cake, together with half a pint of cider, stir in two 
pounds of flour and a grated nutmeg. Bake it about 
half an hour. This cake should be eaten in the 
course of two or three days after it is made, as it gets 
dry very quick. 

144. Cookies. 

Stir together one cup of butter, two of sugar. Dis- 
solve a tea spoonful of saleratus in a cup of milk, (wa- 
ter will do but the cake will not be as rich,) stir it into 
the cake, together with a table spoonful of caraway 




_Sweet Calces. 49 

seed, and one egg beaten to a froth, knead in flour 
till of the right consistency to roll out easily. * Lay 
the cake on a moulding board, and if you cannot roil 
it out without its sticking to the rolling pin, more flour 
should be added. Stamp and cut it into cakes, lay 
them on fiat tins well buttered, bake them in a quick 
oven. 

145. New Year's Cookies. 

Mix one pound of butter, a pound and three quar- 
ters of sugar, dissolve a couple of tea spoonsful of sal- 
eratus, in a pint of milk, and turn it on to the butter 
and sugar when well mixed, beat three eggs to a froth 
and stir them into the cake, with a grated nutmeg, and 
three heaping table spoonsful of caraway seed. Sift 
three pound's of flour and work into the cake with the 
hand. Roll them half an inch thick, and bake them 
immediately in a quick oven. 

146. Plain Tea Cakes. 

Stir together half a tea cup of butter, two of sugar, 
turn in a tea cup of milk with a tea spoonful of sal- 
eratus dissolved in it, add one half of a grated nutmeg, 
and flour enough to enable you to roll it out, cut it in- 
to small cakes. 

147. Shrewsbury Cake. 

Mix a pound of butter, with twelve ounces of sugar, 
add five eggs beaten to a froth, a little rosewater, or 
essence of lemon, and a pound of flour, roll the cake 
out thin, and stamp and cut it into cakes, and bake 
them in a quick oven. 

148. Tunbridge Cake. 

Stir six ounces of butter with the same quantity 
of sugar, beat a couple of eggs and put in, together 

5

with a table spoonful of cream, and a little orange flow- 
er water, or essence of lemon; add three quarters of a 
pound of flour, roll it out thin and cut it into cakes. 

149. Jumbles. 

Mix half a pound of sugar, with the same quantity 
of butter, five beaten eggs, a little essence of lemon ; 
add a pound of flour when well mixed. Roll it about 
half an inch thick, cut it into narrow strips of equal 
length, join the ends together so as to form rings. 
Bake them on flat tins. 

150. Simbals. 

Rub together half a pound of sugar, quarter of a 
pound of butter ; dissolve a lea spoonful of saleratus, 
in half a cup of milk, put it into the cake, with a coup- 
le of beaten eggs, a little mace or nutmeg. Then 
add flour enough to render it sufficiently stiff, to roll 
out. It should be rolled in pounded white sugar, cut 
into strips, and the ends joined in the form of rings. 

151. Sugar Gingerbread.

eggs dropping from it. Then stir in the sugar very 
gradually ; stir it without any cessation for fifteen min- 
utes, then add a tea spoonful of lemon juice, vinegar

neal powder, or a little powder blue. As soon as you

hardens. , 

181. Cocoanut Cakes.

in half a pound of sifted loaf sugar; it should be stir- 
red in very gradually, and beaten eight or ten minutes, 
then add half a pound of grated cocoanut, the brown 
part should be cut off before it is grated. Put in a 
table spoonful of the milk of the cocoanut, if you have

ty minutes.

Trifles. 61

185. Rice Flour Blanc Mange.

boiling milk. Boil the whole together ten minutes,

the fire, stir into it the beaten whites of threee ggs,

62 Pastry. 

perfectly cold "put it into an ice cream form, (if you 
cannot procure one, a milk kettle will do,) set it into 
a large tub, strew round it a layer of ice cracked fine, 
then a layer of rock salt, then another layer of ice 
and salt, and so on, till the ice is as high as the top of 
the form ; a layer of ice should be last. Shake the 
form frequently, while the cream is freezing ; care 
must be taken that none of the salt gets into the cream. 
The tub should be covered with a flannel cloth, while 
the cream is freezing. If you wish to shape the cream 
in moulds, turn it into them, as soon as it freezes in 
the form, and set them in the tub, and let them re- 
main in it, till just before they are to be eaten. When 
you wish to get them out of the moulds or form, dip 
them into warm water and take them out of it instant- 
ly and turn them out into your dishes. Where cream 
is used instead of milk, no eggs or scalding will be ne- 
cessary. Three table spoonsful of pine apple juice, 
to a quart of the cream gives it a fine flavor, straw- 
berries are also nice in the cream. If you wish to 
color the cream, stir in a little cochineal powder, saf- 
fron or powder blue, before you freeze it. 

1ST. Pastry. 

For good common pie crust, allow two tea cups of 
shortening to a quart of flour, and a tea spoonful of salt, 
half lard and half butter is the best, beef shortening 
does very well with butler for plain pie crust. Rub 
part of the shortening thoroughly with two thirds of 
the flour; then put in the salt, together with cold wa- 
ter, to moisten it just enough to roll out easily. Roll 
it out thin, spread on the reserved shortening, then 
sprinkle on the remainder of your flour, and roll it up. 
Cut it into as many pieces as you have pies, roll out 
the under crust very thin, butter your pie plates, and 
put it on them, fill your plates with your fruit, roll out 
the upper crust lightly, about half an inch thick, and 



Pastry. 63 

cover your pies, pare it off neatly round the edges of 
the plates. This rule furnishes crust enough for a 
couple of pies. Pie crust to be light, should be baked 
in a quick oven. 

188. Puff Paste or Confectioner's Pastry. 

Sift three quarters of a pound of flour, and mix it 
with cold water enough to render it sufficiently stiff 
to roll out, put in one half a lea spoonful of salt, be- 
fore you put in the water. Weigh out a pound of 
butter, cut it into thin slices, and roll it out thin as 
possible on a moulding board ; inyorder to- do this a 
great deal of flour should be sprinkled on the board 
and butter, and rubbed on the rolling pin. Lay your 
rolled butter on a platter. Then roll out your crust 
very thin, lay the pieces of butter thickly over it. 
Weigh out a quarter of a pound of sifted flour, and 
sprinkle part of it over it, roll it up, then roll it out 
ngain, put on the remainder of the butter and flour, 
roll it up and let it stand half an hour in a cool place. 
Roll it out lightly half an inch thick, for the upper crust 
to the pies. Bake it in a quick oven till of a light 
brown. 

189. Apple Pie. 

Pare, quarter, and take out the cores of the apples, 
and if not ripe, stew them before baking them, and 
season them to your tase. Butter your plates, put on 
a thin under crust, fill the plates, and cover them with 
a thick crust. Bake them about three quarters of an 
hour. When done take off the upper crust carefully, 
and put a piece of butter of the size of a walnut, into 
each pie, sweeten them to your taste, if not acid 
enough, squeeze in the juice of part of a lemon, or 
put in a little tartaric acid, dissolved in a little water. 
Essence of lemon, nutmeg, or rosewater, are all good 



64 Pastry. 

spice for apple pies. Apples stewed in new cider, and 
molasses, with a few quinces and strained, with a little 
cinnamon in it makes nice pies. Dried apples for 
pies, should have boiling water turned on them, and 
slewed till tender, then add a little sour cider, and a 
little orange peel, and stew them a few moments long- 
er, take them up, put in a little butter, sugar } and the 
juice and peel of a lemon improve them, they are bet- 
ter for being rubbed through a sieve. Fill your pie 
^ plates and bake the pies half an hour. 

190. Mince Pie. 

The best kind of meat for mince pies, is neats 
tongue and feet, and chickens; a shank of beef makes 
very good pies. Boil your meat till perfectly tender, 
then take it up, clear it from the bones and gristle, 
chop it very fine and mix it with double the quantity 
of chopped apple; if the meat is not fat, put in a little 
suet or melted butter, moisten it with cider, add 
cloves, mace, or nutmeg, and cinnamon, to your taste> 
sweeten it with molasses and sugar, add a little salt. If 
you wish to have your pies very rich, put in wine or 
brandy to your taste, the juice and peel of a lemon, 
the peel should be grated, and stoned raisins and cit- 
ron cut in small strips. Bake the pies in shallow 
plates. Make apertures in the upper crust, before 
you cover the pies. Bake the pies from half, to three 
quarters of an hour. Mince meat for pies, with bran- 
dy or wine in it, and strongly spiced will keep several 
months, in cold weather. It should be put in a stone 
pot, and kept in a dry cool place. 

; 191. Peach Pie. 

Take mellow juicy peaches, wash and put them in 
a deep pie plate, or pudding dish, lined with pie crust, 
sprinkle sugar on each layer of peaches, a great deal 



Pastry. 65 

will be necessary to sweeten them sufficiently, put in 
about a table spoonful of water, sprinkle a little flour 
over the top and cover the pie with a thick crust. 
Bake it an hour. Pies made in this manner are much 
better than with the stones taken out, as the prussic 
acid of the stones, gives the pie a fine flavor. Dried 
peaches should be stewed and sweetened, before being 
made into pies; they do not require any spice. 

192. Tart Pie. 

Sour apples, cranberries, and dried peaches, all 
make nice tarts. Stew and strain them; if the peach- 
es are not tart, put in the juice and grated peel of a 
lemon, put in a little sugar. Line shallow pie plates 
with a thin crust, put a rirn of pie crust round the 
edge of the dish, fill the plates with your tart. Roll 
some of the crust very thin, cut it into narrow strips, 
with a jagging iron, and lay it on the pie in a fanciful 
manner. Bake the pies about twenty five minutes. 

193. Rice Pie. 

To a quart of boiling water, put a small tea cup of 
rice, and boil it till very soft. Then add a quart of 
milk, strain it through a sieve, put in a little salt, five 
beaten eggs, a nutmeg grated, and sugar enough to 
sweeten it, the sugar should be put in before the rice is 
strained, add a few raisins. Bake it in deep pie plates, 
without an upper crust. 

194. Rhubarb or Persian Apple Pie. 

Take the stalks of the rhubarb plant in the spring, 
or fore part of summer, (they are not good later,) cut 
them in small pieces, and slew them till tender; then 
strain and sweeten them to your taste, bake them with 
only an under crust.

195. Cherry and Blackberry Pies. 

Cherries and blackberries for pies, should be per- 
fectly ripe ; put them in a deep plate, with an under 
crust, and sprinkle sugar and cinnamon, or cloves, 
over them ; cover them and bake them half an hour. 

196. Crape Pie. 

Grapes are the best for pies when very small and 
tender; if not very small, they should be stewed and 
strained, on account of the seeds. Sweeten them to 
your taste, no spice is necessary. 

197. Currant and Gooseberry Pies. 

Pick them over, and stew them in just water enough 
to prevent their burning at the bottom, when tender 
sweeten them to your taste with sugar, and bake them 
without any spice, in deep dishes. Some people do 
not stew the currants before baking them, but they are 
not apt to be sweet enough, if not previously stewed. 

198. Pumpkin Pie. 

Cut your pumpkin in two, take out the seeds, and 
wash the pumpkin, cut it into small strips, and boil it 
in just water enough to prevent its burning, when len- 
der turn off the water, and let it steam over a moder- 
ate fire for fifteen minutes, taking care it does not burn. 
Take it up, strain it through the sieve, and if you like 
the pies very thin, put two quarts of milk, to a quart 
of the pumpkin, and six eggs ; if you wish to have 
them thick, put a quart only of milk, to a quart of 
pumpkin, and three eggs. Three eggs to a quart of 
milk does very well, but they are better with five or 
six. Sweeten it with molasses or sugar, put in gin- 



Pastry. 67 

ger, or grated lemon peel to your taste. Bake them 
in deep plates from fifty to sixty minutes in a hot oven. 

199. Carrot Pie.

spoonsful of it to a quart of milk, three beaten eggs, 
four table spoonsful of sugar, half a tea spoonsful of salt, 
half a nutmeg, and a table spoonsful of melted butter. 
Bake it an hour and a half; it is good without the 
eggs, if baked two hours and a half. It does not re- 
quire any sauce. 

213. Ji Rich Bread Pudding. 

Cut a loaf of baker's bread into thin slices, spread 
butler on both sides ; lay them in a buttered pudding 
dish, and on each layer strew Zante currants, or ston- 
ed raisins, and citron cut into small pieces. Beat 
eight eggs with six table spoonsful of sugar rolled free

niilk, then bake it about three quarters of an hour. 

214. Flour Pudding. 

Into a pint and a half of flour, stir gradually a quart 
of milk; stir it till free from lumps, then add seven 
beaten eggs, a couple of tea spoonsful of salt, and a 
grated nutmeg. A pudding made in this manner is 
good either baked or boiled; it takes two hours to boil 
and one to bake it. It should be eaten as soon as 
cooked or it will be heavy. This as well as all other 
kinds of boiled puddings should not be put into the pot 
until the water boils and should not be allowed to stop 
for a moment, if the water wastes much in boiling, fill 
the pot up with boiling water. A pudding bag should 
be floured on the inside, and not filled more than two 
thirds full. When the pudding has boiled six or eight

minutes turn it over, as it is apt to settle. Flour pud- 
dings require rich sauce. 

215. Ji Plain Rice Pudding. 

Swell the rice with a little milk over a fire, then 
put in acid apples pared and cut in thin slices, or 
gooseberries and currants, add a couple of eggs, a tea

two of sugar, and a grated nutmeg. Butter a pudding 
dish, set it in a bake pan, then turn in the pudding, 
when it begins to thicken stir in three tea cups full of 
raisins. Bake it two hours, it will not fall if taken 
from the fire sometime before it is to be eaten, it is 
also good cold. It is good without any sauce, and is 
the only kind of pudding that eggs do not improve. 

217. Rice Snow Balls.

flour. When cool beat three eggs with the same 
quantity of sugar, and stir it into the pudding, together 
with a tea spoonful of salt, three tea spoonsful of cin- 
namon, and a piece of butter of the size of an egg. 
If raisins are put in the pudding, a tea cup more of 
milk will be required, as they absorb the milk. This 
pudding is good if the eggs are omitted. It takes two 
hours and a half to bake it. 

219. Boiled Indian Pudding. 

Into a quart of boiling milk, stir a couple of table 
spoonsful of flour, and sifted Indian meal till it is a 
thick batter, and half a table spoonful of ginger or 
cinnamon, half a tea cup of molasses. Dip the pud- 
ding bag into water, wring it out, and flour the inside 
of it, and fill it not more than half full, as Indian pud- 
dings swell very much. Put it into boiling water, and 
keep it boiling constantly for four or five hours. A 
kettle of boiling water should be kept, to turn into the 
pudding pot as the water boils away. 

220. Corn Pudding. 

Grate a cup and a half of green corn, mix it with 
a quart of milk, four beaten eggs, and half a grated 
nutmeg ; melt a piece of butter of the size of a hen's 
egg, and stir it in. Bake it one hour. 

221. Hasty Pudding. 

Wet Indian meal with cold water sufficient to make 
a thin batter, turn part of it into a pot of boiling water ; 
when it has boiled fifteen or twenty minutes stir in the 
remainder, salt it to your taste, and stir in Indian meal 
by the handful as long as you can stir the pudding 
stick round in it easily. When the stick can be made 
to stand upright in it for a minute, it is thick enough.

74 Puddings. 

It should boil slowly, and be stirred often; if you wish 
to fry it, it will be necessary to boil it, from two to three 
hours, if not it will boil sufficiently in an hour. If a 
little flour is stirred in just before it is taken up, it will 
fry better. Turn it into a deep dish, and if it is to be 
fried, let it stand till cold, then cut it into thin slices, 

flour and fry them in lard, till very brown. 

? 

222. Fruit Pudding. 

Take raised or common pie crust, and roll it out 
about half an inch thick. Strew over it either cur- 
rants, cherries, cranberries, gooseberries, black or 
wbortle berries. Sprinkle sugar, and cinnamon or 
cloves over them. Roll it up carefully, join the ends 
together, and put it in a floured cloth and sew it up. 
Boil it an hour, and eat it with sauce as soon as done. 

223. Fritters. 

9 

Mix a quart of milk gradually, with a quart of flour, 
stir it till smooth, then add a little essence of lemon, 
or rosewater, and five beaten eggs. Drop it into boil- 
ing hot fat by the spoonsful. They are lighter for 
being fried in a great deal of fat, hut less greasy if fri- 
ed in just enough to prevent their sticking to the grid- 
dle. They should be served up with pudding sauce. 

224. Jlpple Dumplings. 

Make good common, or raised pie crust, divide it 
into as many pieces, as you wish dumplings. Pare 
tart mellow apples, take out the cores, with a penknife, 
fill the holes with a blade of mace, and sugar. Roll 
out your crust half an inch thick, and enclose an apple 
in each piece. Tie them up in separate bags, that 
are floured inside. Drop them into a pot of boiling 
water, and boil them without any intermission for an 



Puddings. 75 

hour, then take them out of the bags. If allowed 
to stop boiling they will not be light. Eat them with 
butter and sugar, or pudding sauce. 

225. Orange Pudding. 

Mix three ounces of butter, with four table spoons- 
ful of powdered loaf sugar, when stirred to a cream, 
add a quart of boiling milk, the juice and peel of two 
large oranges, the peel should be chopped very fine, 
put in a gill of wine, then an ounce of citron, cut into 
small strips, add eight eggs, the whites and yolks beat- 
en separately. Mix the whole well together, then 
turn it into a pudding dish, with a lining and rim of 
puff paste. Bake it directly in a quick oven from 
twenty-five to thirty minutes. 

li 

226. Bird's Nest Pudding. 

Pare and halve tart mellow apples, scoop out the 
cores, put a little flour in the hollow of the apples, and 
wet it so as to form a thick paste, stick a blade or two 
of mace and three or four Zante currants, in each one 
of the apples. Butter small cups, and put half an 
apple, in each one, lay three or four narrow strips of 
citron round each apple. Mix a quart of milk, with 
three table spoonsful of flour, six eggs, a grated nut- 
meg and four table spoonsful of sugar. Nearly fill the 
cups with this mixture. Bake them about thirty min- 
utes. They should be eaten as soon as done. 

227. Apple Custard Pudding. 

Pare and take out the cores of nice tart apples, 
lay them in a pudding dish, well buttered, fill the 
holes of the apples, with nutmeg and sugar. For 
nine or ten apples, mix half a pint of flour with a 
quart of milk, four table spoonsful of sugar, and seven 



76 Puddings. Syrups. 


eggs, turn it over the apples, flavor it with whatever 

spice you like, and bake it about half an hour. 

228. English Plum Pudding. 

Soak three quarters of a pound of finely pounded 
crackers in two quarts of milk. Putin twelve beaten 
eggs, half a pound of stoned raisins, quarter of a pound 
of Zante currants, the same weight of citron, cut into 
small pieces, and five ounces of blanched and pounded 
almonds; add a wine glass of lemon brandy, or wine, 
and a little orange flower, or rosewater, and a little 
salt. Bake or boil it from two hours and a half, to 
three hours. 

229. Transparent Pudding. 

Melt half a pound of butter, and stir it into the same 
weight of double refined loaf sugar, add half a tea 
spoonful of essence of lemon, eight eggs, the whites 
and yolks beaten separately, and a couple of table 
spoonsful of cream. Set the whole on a few coals, 
stir it constantly till it thickens, take it off before it 
gets to boiling, and stir it till nearly cold, then turn it 
into a dish lined with pastry, put a rim of puff paste 
round the edge, and bake it half an hour. It will cut 

light and clear. 



230. Lemon Syrup. 

Mix a pint of lemon juice with a pound and three 
quarters of lump sugar. Dissolve it by a gentle heat, 
skim it until clear, then add one ounce of thin cut 
lemon peel, and simmer it' gently for a few moments. 
Strain jt through a flannel bag";- when cold, bottle, 
cork, and seal it tight, keep it in a cool place. Anoth- 
er method of making it which ^cheaper, and very 
good, is to dissolve half an ounc of citric acid, in a 



Syrups. 77 

pint of clarified syrup, by a gentle heat ; when cool, 
put in a few drops of oil or a liitle essence of lemon. 

231. Orange Syrup. 

Take nice fresh oranges, squeeze out the juice, and 
strain it; to a pint of juice put a pound and a half of 
while sugar. Dissolve it over a moderate fire, put in 
the peel of the oranges, and let the whole boil eight 
or ten minutes. Strain it till clear, through a flannel 
bag, bottle and cork it tight. This is nice to flavor 
puddings and pies, or sherbet. 

232. Blackberry Syrup. 

Pick over blackberries that are perfectly ripe, boil 
them in their juice till they break to pieces, then strain 
them through a flannel cloth, and to each pint of juice 
put a pound of sugar. Boil it again for ten minutes, 
then strain it and add a wine glass of brandy to each 
pint of syrup. When cool, bottle and cork it tight, 
and set it in a cool place. This mixed with cold wa- 
ter in the proportion of a wine glass of it to two thirds 
of a tumbler of wafer is a very agreeable summer bev- 
erage, it also .possesses fine medicinal properties. 

233. Clarified Syrup for Sweet Meats. 

For most kinds of fruit, one pound of sugar, to one 
of the fruit, is sufficient to preserve them ; some kinds 
of fruit will do with less. Put your sugar into your 
preserving kettle, and turn in as much cold water as 
you think will cover your fruit, when put in, add the 
white of an egg to ey^ery three pounds of sugar, then 
put it over a slow fire ; when the sugar has dissolved, 
put it where it will boil, let it boil several minutes, 
then take it from thcffire, and skim it till clear, put it 
back on the fire, when the scum rises again, take the 

7* 



78 Sweet Meats. 

kettle off and skim it again, this operation repeat till it 
is perfectly clear, then put in the fruit. If you have 
not syrup enough to cover the fruit, take the fruit out 
and put in more cold water, and let it get to boiling 
before you put in the fruit, if you have too much 
syrup, it should boil away before you boil your fruit 
in it. White sugar is better than brown for preserv- 
ing, but brown sugar answers very well for common 
sweet meats. Every kind of ware but iron, will do 
to preserve in, but earthen ware is the best on account 
of its not imparting an unpleasant taste, to the sweet 
meats. 

234. To Preserve Quinces. 

Quinces if very ripe, are best pared and cut in sli- 
ces about an inch thick, the cores should be taken out 
carefully with a small knife, then put the quinces in 
clarified syrup, and boil ihem till you can stick a broom 
splinter through them easily, take them up and put 
them in jars, and turn the syrup over them, cover them 
up, and put them in a cool place, as soon as done. 
Quinces preserved in this manner retain more of their 
natural flavor, but they cannot be preserved in this 
way without they are very ripe. If not very ripe pare 
and halve them, and lake out the cores. Boil the 
quinces till tender, then take them out, strain the wa- 
ter they were boiled in, and use it to make a syrup for 
the quinces, allow a "pound of sugar to a pound of the 
fruit, when clarified put in the quinces and boil them 
slowly half an hour*. Set them away in jars covered 
with a paper wet in brandy. Look at them in the 
course of three or four days, and if they have begun 
to ferment, turn off the syrup, and scald it, then turn 
it back on the quinces. Some people boil the cores 
of the quinces with them, but the syrup does not look 
as nice for it. A cheap way of preserving quinces, 
which is very good for common use, is to boil the 






Sweet Meats. 79 

parings and cores in cider till tender, then strain the 
cider, and for ten pounds of quince, put in two pounds 
of brown sugar, and a couple of quarts of molasses, 
and the beaten whites of two eggs; put it on the fire, 
clarify it, then put in the quinces, which should be par- 
ed and halved, put in the peel of an orange, boil them 
till tender. 

235. Quince Marmalade. 

Wash and quarter them, put them on the fire, with 
a little water, and stew them till tender enough to rub 
through a sieve. When strained, put to a pound of 
pulp, a pound of brown sugar, set it back on the fire, 
and let it stew slowly, stir it constantly. To ascertain 
when it is done, takt? a little of it out and let it get cold, 
if it then cuts smooth and clear it is sufficiently stewed. 
Crab apple marmalade, is made in the same manner. 

236. To Preserve Pears. 

Take an ounce of race ginger, for every pound 
of pears. Scrape off the skin, cut it into thin slices, 
and boil it until tender, then take it from the fire, put 
in your sugar, allowing three quarters of a pound to a j 
pound of the pears, set it on the fire, clarify it, then 
put in the pears, if very small they are good pre- 
served whole, boil them till tender, then put them in 
jars tightly covered, set them away in a cool place. 
In the course of five or six days, boil the syrup again, 
and turn it on them while hot. Choke and Vergou- 
louse are tb best pears for preserving. The ginger 
can be omitted if not liked. 

/ 

237. To Preserve Peaches. 

t 

Pare your peaches, which should be very ripe, and 
if you wish to preserve them whole, allow a pound of 






80 Sweet Meats. 

sugar, to a pound of fruit. Take lump sugar, break it 
into small pieces, and dip each piece into cold water, 
let it be in just long enough to get saturated with the 
water, then put the lumps into a preserving kettle, set 
the kettle over a slow fire, when the sugar has dissolv- 
ed, put in your peaches, boil them twenty minutes. 
These as well as all other sweet meats, should be set 
away in a cool place, as soon as done, if allowed to 
stand by the fire for a few hours, the syrup will not 
look clear ; all preserves should be covered up tight. 
Let them remain several days, then turn the syrup 
from them, scald it, and turn it back on to them, while 
hot. If you preserve your peaches without the stones, 
three quarters of a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit 
is sufficient, take those that are mellow and juicy, 
pare and halve them, take out the stones, put them in 
a deep dish ; on each layer of peach, sprinkle your 
sugar, let them stand three or four hours, then put 
them on the fire with very little water, let them boil 
slowly for twenty minutes. 






238. To Preserve Currants. 

Take your currants from the stems, for a pound of 
currants, allow a pound of sugST. Make some syrup, 
clarify it, and put in the currants, let them boil slowly 
for a few moments. A table spoonful of these, mix- 
ed with a tumbler of water is a very wholesome drink 
in the summer. 

239. To Preserve Barberries. 

Pick over your barberries, and put them in clarifi- 
ed syrup, boil them half an hour. Molasses does ve- 
ry well to preserve barberries in, for common use, 
with a little orange peel boiled with them. Preserv- 
ed barberries mixed with water, is a very refreshing 
drink in fevers. 



Sweet Meats. 81 



240. To Preserve Ginger. 

Take green ginger, and soak it until you can scrape 
off the outside, when scraped, soak it in salt and wa- 
ter one day, then take it out of the salt and water, 
and boil it till tender. Make a syrup of white sugar, 
allowing equal weights of sugar and ginger, when clar- 
ified take it off, and when cold, turn it on the ginger, 
let it remain a week, then boil the ginger and syrup to- 
gether, until the syrup appears to have entered the 
ginger, when cool put in a little essence of lemon. 

241. To Preserve Apples. 

Take nice tart apples, halve and quarter them, and 
take out the cores. For a pound of apples, allow 
three quarters of a pound of sugar. When you have 
clarified your syrup, put in the apples, with the skin 
of a lemon pared thin. When the apples are tender, 
take them up, and let the syrup remain till cold, then 
turn it over them. Apples preserved in this manner, 
will keep but a few days. Crab apples should be 
preserved whole, with the skins on, and to a pound of 
the apples put a pound -of sugar. 

242. To Preserve Cymbelines or Mock Citron. 

Cut and scrape the rinds of cymbelines, put them 
in strong salt and water, let them remain in it a week, 
then in fair water three clays, changing the water every 
day, then soak them in alum water an hour. Tie up 
oyster shells, in a cloth, and boil them with the cym- 
belines. When the cymbelines are tender, take them 
up and put them in alum water. Make your syrup, 
allowing a pound and a half of sugar, to a pound of 
the melon, boil your cymbelines in it three quarters of 
an hour. These are good eaten as any other pre- 
serves, or put in cake instead of citron. 



$2 Sweet Meats. 



243. To Preserve Watermelon Rinds. 

Take the rind of a nice watermelon, cut it in strips 
and boil them a quarter of an hour, with a tea spoonful 
of saleratus to three or four quarts of water, then soak 
them in alum water an hour, rinse and put them in 
clarified syrup, and boil them twenty minutes. When 
they have stood three or four days, turn the syrup from 
them, and boil it, then turn it back on the rinds while 
hot. Allow equal weights of rinds and sugar. 

244. To Preserve Cherries. 

Allow three quarters of a pound of sugar, to a 
pound of cherries. Make your syrup, allowing half 
a pint of water, to two pounds of cherries, put in your 
cherries, shake them occasionally to prevent their 
sticking to the kettle. When the syrup is colored 
strain the cherries. 

245. To Preserve Muskmelons. 

Procure muskmelons that are perfectly green, the 
later in the season, the better. Scrape off the skin 
of the rind, taking care not to scrape the green part. 
Cut them through the middle, and take out the seeds, 
then cut them in the form of rings an inch thick. Put 
them in salt and water, and let them lay several days, 
then i fair water one day, changing the water several 
times ; take them out and soak them in alum water, 
one or two hours. Take race ginger, the green is 
the best, soak it until you can scrape off the outside, 
cut it in slices, and boil it until tender. Boil your 
melons in fresh water, with a handful of peach leaves, 
and the ginger, allowing half an ounce to each pound 
of fruit. When the melon is tender, put it in alum 
water, together with the ginger. Make the syrup for 



Sweet Meats. 83 

the melons, allowing a pound of white sugar, to a 
pound of the fruit, when clarified put in the melons, 
and boil them, together with the ginger, half an hour, 
take them up, turn the syrup over them, when cool, 
drop in a little essence of lemon. When they have 
stood several days turn the syrup from them, boil and 
turn it back while hot, to the melons. 

246. To Preserve Pine Apples. 

Pare off the rind of the pine apples, cut them in 
slices an inch thick. Weigh out a pound of white 
sugar, allowing a pound of it to each pound of fruit, 
lay your pine apples in a deep dish, on each layer of 
it sprinkle some of your sugar, (which should be 
powdered.) Set the pine apples away till the next 
day, reserving part of the sugar. Then turn the syr- 
up from the pine apples into your preserving pan, add 
your reserved sugar, put in a tea cup of water, to the 
juice of four or five pine apples, clarify it, then put in 
the apples, and boil them till lender. Let the whole, 
stand in a dish several days, and if there is any appear- 
ance of fermentation, put it in a preserving pan, scald 
it through, then turn it into glasses, and set it in a cool 
place. 






247. To Preserve Pumpkins. 

Take a good sweet pumpkin, halve it, take out the 
seeds, and cut it in chips, of the size of a dollar. To 
each pound of pumpkin, allow a pound of powdered 
loaf sugar, and a gill of lemon juice. Put your pump- 
kin chips in a dish, and to each layer, put a layer of 
sugar, turn the lemon juice over the whole, and let it 
stand a day, then boil it till tender, with half a pint of 
water to four or five pounds of the pumpkin. Tie up 
ginger in a bag, and boil with it, also the rind of sever- 
al lemons, cut into chips. 



84 Sweet Meats. 



248. To Preserve Gages. 

Take equal quantities of fruit and sugar. Make a 
syrup of the sugar, (which should be white,) with a 
little water, when it boils drop in the plums, boil them 
very slowly for a few moments, then take them up in- 
to dishes, and let them 'remain several days, then boil 
them again, until the syrup appears to have entered 
them. Put the plums in jars, boil the syrup again, in 
the course of two or three days, and turn it over them. 

249. To Preserve Strawberries. 

Take Chili or field strawberries, and hull them. 
Take equal quantities of fruit, and white sugar, and put 
a layer of each alternately in a preserving pan, having 
a layer of strawberries at the bottom, let them stand for 
half an hour, then put a gill of cold water with ihem, 
to prevent their burning at the* bottom of the pan. 
Set them over a moderate fire, when the juice runs 
freely increase the fire, until they boil briskly, when 
they have boiled half an hour, take them up, turn them 
into bottles, cork them tight, and dip the moiuhs of the 
bottles into hot sealing wax. Keep them in dry sand. 

250. Blackberry and Raspberry Jam. 

For a pound of berries allow a pound of brown su- 
gar, put a layer of each alternately in a dish, let them 
stand two or three hours, strain them, put them over 
a moderate fire, and boil them half an hour. 

251. Strawberry , Blackberry, and Raspberry Jelly. 

Pick overyour fruit carefully, then mash and squeeze 
the berries through a flannel bag, to each pint of juice 
put a pound of white sugar, set it on the fire, when it 



Jellies. 85 

has boiled seven or eight minutes, take it from the fire 
and skim it till clear, then put it back on the fire ; as 
fast as the scum rises take it from the fire, and skim 
it. To ascertain when it is done, take a little of it 
from the fire, and let it be till cold. 

252. Cranberry, Grape and Currant Jelly. 

Wash and drain the berries till nearly dry, then put 
them in a preserving pan, with a plate at the bottom, 
heat them till they break, then strain them through a 
flannel cloth ; to each pint put a pound of white su- 
gar. Boil and skim them till perfectly clear, the ket- 
tle should be taken from the fire when skimmed. 
When the jelly has boiled four or five hours, take a 
little of it up, and put it in a tumbler of cold water, if 
it sinks to the bottom in a solid mass, it is done suffi- 
ciently. Jellies are improved, by being put in the sun 
for several days. Care must be taken, that the dew 
does not fall on them. 



253. Quince Jelly. 

Halve your quinces, take out the cores, and boil 
the quinces until very soft, in just sufficient water to 
cover them, then squeeze them through a flannel bag, 
and to a pound of quince pulp, put a pound of white 
sugar. Boil and skim it till clear; when it becomes a 

i_* f 

jelly, strain it again, fill your glasses and cover them 
tight. 

254. Apple Jelly. 

Take greenings, pippins or crab apples, halve them 
and take out the cores, boil them till tender in water 
just sufficient to cover them, boil with them the peel 
and juice of a lemon, to every three pounds of the 
apple. Strain the apple, and to each pound, put a 
pound of loaf sugar. Boil and skim it till clear; when 

8 



86 Jellies. 

it becomes a jelly, take it up, color it if you like, either 
with saffron, beet juice, or cochineal. Strain it, and 
put it in glasses, and set them in a cool place. 

255. Lemon Jelly. 

Put on a slow fire an ounce and a half of isinglass, 
(pulled into small pieces,) a pint of water, with the 
rind of several lemons; when dissolved put in a pint of 
lemon juice, a pound and a half of white sugar, color 
it with a few grains of saffron, strain it through a flan- 
nel bag, then boil it ten or fifteen minutes, strain it till 
clear, let it remain till nearly congealed, then fill your 
glasses or moulds with it. To get it out of the moulds 
dip them into lukewarm water for a minute, the jelly 
will then come out easily. 

256. Calfs Foot Jelly. 

To four feet put four quarts of water, boil them till 
tender, and the water boils away to one quart. Take 
it off, let it stand till cold, then skim off the fat care- 
fully, and put the jelly into a preserving pan, and set 
it on the fire; when it melts take it from the fire, put 
in the beaten whites of seven eggs, a little cinnamon, 
half a pint of white wine, the juice of two lemons, and 
the rind, leaving out the white part; sweeten the whole 
to your taste, with loaf sugar. Put it back on the 
fire, and boil it fifteen minutes, then strain it through a 
flannel bag, without squeezing it, if it is not clear the 
first time it is strained, strain it till it is. The bag 

O 

should be suspended on a nail over a dish, and the jel- 
ly poured into it, and allowed to drain through it grad- 
ually. When clear turn it into cups or glasses, and 
set them" where the jelly will congeal, but not so cold 
as to freeze it. This kind of jelly will not keep longer 
than two or three clays in warm weather. A knuckle 
of veal makes a jelly as good as calves' feet, it is made 



Coffee. 87 

in the same manner. Jellies and sweet meats are less 
liable to ferment, if kept in glass jars or bottles. A 
.paper wet in spirits and put over sweet meats, has a 
tendency to prevent their fermenting. Sweet meats 
should be carefully watched during warm weather, and 
if fermentation commences turn the syrup from them, 
scald it, and turn it back. 

257. Coffee. 

To make good strong coffee, allow for each person 
a heaping table spoonful of ground coffee, and a pint 
of water. Put your coffee into a tin pot, with a piece 
of fish skin about the size of a ninepence, to two or 
three quarts of water, turn on your water boiling hot, 
and boil the coffee from fifteen to twenty minutes, 
take it off, and let it stand to settle five or six minutes, 
then turn it off carefully. French coffee is made in 
a German filter, the water is turned on to it boiling 
hot, an ounce to each person is allowed, put in a piece 
of fish skin before you turn on the water. When 
cream cannot be preserved for coffee, boiled milk is 
a good substitute. Many people dislike to settle cof- 
fee with fish skin, thinking it imparts a disagreeable 
taste to the coffee, but it is owing to its not being pre- 
pared properly, the skin should be taken from mild 
codfish, washed, and cut into small pieces and dried 
perfectly. The white of an egg, egg shells, and is- 
inglass, are all good to settle coffee. The best kind 
of coffee is old Java, and Mocha; before it is roasted, 
it should be hung over the fire two or three hours to 
dry, if dried in. the oven it looses its strength, it should 
be hung at such a distance from the fire, as to be in 
no danger of burning. When dry put it on hot coals, 
and stir it constantly till done, which is ascertained by 
biting one of the lightest kernels, if it is brittle, the 
whole is done. r Put it in a box, and cover it up 
tight, to keep in the steam. 



88 Tea . Chocola te .Beer. 

Coffee is much better roasted in a coffee roaster, 
than a kettle, as the fine aromatic flavor of the coffee is 
preserved, which escapes in a great measure, when 
roasted in an open kettle. 

258. To make Tea. 

Scald your tea pot, and put in a tea spoonful of tea, 
for each person that is to drink it, if it is a weak kind 
of tea, more will be required, pour on just boiling 
water enough to cover it, let it stand six or eight min- 
utes, not longer if you wish to have it in perfection, 
pour on the rest of the water boiling hot. 

259. Chocolate. 

Scrape the chocolate off fine, and mix it smoothly 
with a little cold milk, or water. If liked very rich, 
make it entirely of milk, if not, use equal quantities of 
milk and water, boil it, then stir in the chocolate while 
. boiling, sweeten it to your taste, let it boil five or six 
minutes ; if liked rich, grate in a little nutmeg. A heap- 
ing table spoonful of grated chocolate to a pint of milk, 
or water, is the right proportion. 

260. Hop Beer. 

% 

For three gallons of beer, take nine quarts of water, 
six ounces of hops. Boil the hops in half the water 
three hours, strain it, then boil the hops again in the 
remainder of the water, three hours longer, with a tea 
cup of ginger. Strain and put it with the rest of the 
liquor, and two quarts of molasses, and when luke- 
warm, put in a pint of new yeast, without any salt in 
it. Keep it in a temperate place, till it has ceased 
fermenting, which is ascertained by the froth subsi- 
ding. Turn it off carefully into a cask, or bottle it ; 
it should not be corked very tight, or it will burst the, 
bottles. Keep the bottles in a cool place, 



Beer. 89 



261. Spruce Beer. 

Take five gallons of water, and boil with a couple of 
ounces of hops, when it has boiled four or five hours, 
strain it, put to it two quarts of molasses, when luke- 
warm, put in a pint of fresh yeast, without any salt in 
it, (brewer's is the best,) put in three table spoonsful 
of the essence of spruce. A decoction made of the 
leaves of white or black spruce, is equally as good as 
the essence ; boil the hops with the leaves. Let the 
beer stand in a temperate situation, several days ex- 
posed to the air, then put it in a cask, or bottle it, it 
will be fit to to drink in the course of a few days. 
This is a nice summer drink, and a powerful antiscor- 
butic. 

262. Spring Beer. 

Take a small bunch each of sarsaparilla, sweet fern, 
wintergreen, sassafras, and spice wood, boil them with 
three ounces of hops, to six gallons of water, pare two 
or three raw potatoes, and throw them into the beer 
while it is boiling. When it has boiled five or six 
hours, strain it, and put to it three pints of molasses, 
when cool stir in a pint of fresh yeast, if the beer is too 
thick, dilute it with a liitle cold water. When fer~ 
mented, bottle and keep it in a cool place. 

263. Ginger Beer. 

Take three table spoonsful of ginger, one of cream 
of tartar, and boil them gently in a gallon of water, 
with a lemon cut in slices ; sweeten it to your taste, with 
loaf or Havana sugar, boil it three quarters of an hour. 
Strain it, and when cool, put in a lea cup of yeast; as 
soon as it has ceased fermenting, bottle it. 



90 Wines. 



[264. A good Family Wine. 

Take equal parts of red and white currants, grapes, 
raspberries and English cherries, bruise and mix them 
\vith soft water, in the proportion of four pounds of 
fruit, to one gallon of water, let the liquid remain for 
two or three hours, then strain it, and to each gallon of 
wine add three pounds of sugar. Let it stand open 
three days, stirring it frequently, skim, and put it in a 
cask, place it in a temperate situation, where it will 
ferment slowly, when fermented add to it a ninth part 
of brandy, and stop it up tight. In two or three years 
it will be very rich. 

265. Currant Wine. 

Strain the currants, which should be perfectly ripe, 
to each quart of juice, put two of water, and three 
pounds of sugar. Stir the whole well together, and 
let it stand twenty four hours, then skim it, and set 
it in a cool place, where it will ferment slowly, let it 
remain three or four days, if at the end of that time, it 
has fermented, add one quart of French brandy, to 
every fifteen gallons, stop it tight, when it is clear, it is 
fit to bottle. This wine is better for being kept sev- 
eral years. 

266. Raspberry Shrub. 

To a quart of vinegar, put three quarts of fresh ripe 
raspberries, let it stand a day, then strain it, and to 
each pint, put a pound of white sugar. Put it in a 
jar, and set it in a kettle of boiling water, boil it an 
hour, skim it till clear. When cool add a wine glass 
of wine, to each- pint of shrub. A couple of table 
spoonsful of this, mixed with a tumbler of water, is a 
very wholesome and refreshing drink in fevers. 



Wines. 9 1 



267. Noyeau. 

To three pints of good French brandy, put four 
ounces of bitter almonds, or peach meats bruised, put 
in half an ounce of cinnamon, the same quantity of 
mace and amber, pounded fine, add a tea spoonful of 
cloves ; let it stand for a fortnight, shaking it often, 
then add a quart of water, and a pound and a quarter 
of sugar, let it stand a week, shaking it each day, then 
strain it off for use. 

268. Spring Fruit Sherbet. 

Boil in a quart of water six or eight stalks of the 
rhubarb plant, with the peel of a lemon pared very 
thin, and the juice of it. When it has boiled eight, or 
ten minutes, take it, sweeten it to the taste with any 
kind of syrup you like, or honey, flavor it with rose- 
water, strain it, let it stand five or six hours, it will 
then be fit to drink. It is a fine thing to assuage 
thirst. 

269. Grape Wine. 

To every gallon of ripe grapes, put a gallon of soft 
water, bruise the grapes, and let them stand a week, 
without stirring, then draw off the liquor carefully; to 
each gallon, put three pounds of lump sugar, when fer- 
mented, put it in a cask, stop it up tight, in six months 
it will be fit to bottle. 

270. Smallage Cordial. 

Take the young sprouts of smallage, wash and drain 
them till perfectly dry. Cut them into small pieces, 
and put them in a bottle, with stoned raisins, a layer 
of each alternately ; when ihe bottle is two thirds full, 



92 Miscellaneous Receipts. 

fill it up with good French brandy. Cork it up, let 
it stand four or five days, then pour in as much more 
brandy, as you can get in. It will be fit for use in 
the course of a few days. 



Miscellaneous Receipts, and observations useful to 

young housekeepers. 

1. To make Essence of Lemon. 

Take one drachm of the best oil of lemon, and 
two ounces of strong rectified spirit. Mix the spirit 
by degrees, with the oil. Another way to procure 
the essence of the peel, is to rub the peel with lumps 
of sugar, till the yellow part is all taken up. Scrape 
off the surface of the sugar, and press it down tight, 
in a preserving pot, and cover it tight; a little of this 
sugar gives a fine flavor to pies or cake. This mode 
of procuring the essence of the peel, is superior to 
any other, as the fine flavor of the peel is extracted 
without any alloy. 

2. Essence of Ginger. 

Put three ounces of fresh grated ginger, an ounce of 
thin cut lemon peel, into a quart of brandy, or proof 
spirit, bottle and cork it, let it stand for ten days, sha- 
king it up each day, it will then be fit for use. A few 
drops of this, in a little water, or on a lump of sugar, 
answers all the purposes of ginger tea, and is much 
more convenient and palatable. 

3. Rose Water. 

* 

Gather your roses on a dry day, when full blown, 
pick off the leaves, and to a peck of them, put a quart 



Miscellaneous Receipts. 93 

of water. Put them in a cold still, and put it over 
a slow fire, the slower they are distilled the better. 
When distilled put it in the bottles, let it stand a couple 
of days, then cork it tight. 

4. Spice Brandt/. 

Into a large wide mouthed bottle, put French bran- 
dy, and fresh rose leaves, or lemon and orange peel. 
When tliis has stood a week, it is nice spice for pies, 
puddings and cake. Peach meats or almonds steep- 
ed in brandy are very good spice for custards. 

5. Barley Water. 

Take a couple of ounces of pearl barley, wash it in 
cold water, and put it into half a pint of boiling water, 
and let it boil four or five minutes, then turn off the 
water, and pour on two quarts of boiling water, strain 
it, and put to it two ounces of figs sliced, two of ston- 
ed raisins, half an ounce of liquorice cut into small 
bits, and bruised, boil it till reduced to a quart, and 
strain it. This is a very wholesome drink in fevers. 

6. Water Gruel. 

Mix a couple of table spoonsful of Indian meal, with 
one of flour and a little water, stir it into a pint of boil- 
ing water, let it boil six or 'eight minutes, then take it 
up put in a piece of butter of the size of a walnut, 
pepper and salt, to your taste, and nutmeg, or cinna- 
mon if you like, turn it on to toasted bread or crack- 
ers. To convert this into caudle, add a little ale, wine 
or brandy, and loaf sugar. 

7. Wine Whey. 

Into a pint of milk while boiling, stir a couple of 
wine glasses of wine, let it boil for a moment, then 



94 Miscellaneous Receipts. 

take it off, when the curd has settled, turn off the 
whey, and sweeten it with loaf sugar. Where wine 
cannot be procured, cider, or half the quantity of vin- 
egar, is a good substitute. 

8. Stomachic Tincture. 

Bruise an ounce and a half of Peruvian bark, and 
one of bitier dried orange peel. Steep it in brandy 
or proof spirit, for a fortnight, shaking it each day. 
Let it remain for a couple of days without shaking it, 
then decant the liquor. A lea spoonful of it in a wine 
glass of water, is a fine tonic. 

9. Beef Tea. 

Broil a pound of fresh beef ten minutes, take it up, 
pepper and salt it, cut it into small pieces, and turn a 
pint of boiling water on to it, let it steep in a warm 
place for half an hour, then strain it off, and it is fit to 
drink. This is a quick way of making it, but the best 
way is to cut beef into small bits, and fill a junk bottle 
with it, stop it up light, and immerse it in a kettle of 
cold water, put it where it will boil four or five hours. 
This way is superior to the other, as the juices of the 
meat are obtained unmixed with water; a table spoon- 
ful of this is as nourishing as a cup full of that which is 
made by broiling. 

10. Carrageen or Irish Moss. 

American, or Irish Carrageen, is a very nutritious 
and light article of food for children, and invalids, and 
is a good thickener of milk and broths, and for blanc 
mange is equal to the most expensive ingredients, 
while the cost is very trifling. The following decoc- 
tion for consumptive patients, is recommended. Steep 
half an ounce of the moss in cold water, for a few 



Miscellaneous Receipts. 95 

minutes, then take it out, boil it in a quart of milk un- 
til it attains the consistency of warm jelly, strain it, 
and sweeten it to the taste, with white sugar or hon- 
ey, flavor it with whatever spice is most agreeable, if 
milk is disagreeable, water may be substituted. If a 
tea spoonful of the tincture of rhutany is mixed with a 
cup full of the decoction, a tone will be given to the 
stomach, at the same time that nourishment is con- 
veyed to the system. 

1 1. Moss Blanc Mange. 

Steep half an ounce of Irish moss in a pint and a 
half of milk ; when it becomes a thick jelly sweeten it 
with loaf sugar, and flavor it with white wine and cin- 
namon. To make orange, lemon or savory jellies, 
use a similar process, substituting water for milk. 
Jellies made of it, are more nourishing, than those 
made of sago, tapioca or arrow root. 

12. Elderberry Syrup. 

Wash and strain the berries, which should be per- 
fectly ripe, to a pint of the juice put a pint of molas- 
ses. Boil it twenty minutes, stirring it constantly ; 
then take it from the fire, and when cold add to each 
quart four table spoonsful of brandy; boitle and cork 
it. This is an excellent remedy for a tight cough. 

1 3. New Bread and Cake from old and rushed bread. 

Bread that is several days old, may be renewed by 
putting it into a steamer, and steaming it from half to 
three quarters of an hour, according to its size; the 
steamer should not be more than half full, otherwise 
the water will boil up on to the bread. When steam- 
ed, wrap it up loosely in a dry cloth, and let it remain 
till quite dry, it will then appear like bread just baked. 



. 



96 Miscellaneous Receipts. 

If pieces of bread are put in the oven and dried, sev- 
eral hours after baking in it, they will keep good a 
long time. They are good as fresh bread for dress- 
ing to meat, and for puddings, if soaked soft in cold 
water. Rich cake with wine or brandy in it, will 
keep good several months in winter, if kept in a cool 
place. The day it is to be eaten, it should be put in 
a tin pan, and set in a bake pan that has a tea cup of 
water in it, when heated thoroughly through take it 
up. 

14. To Preserve Cheese from Insects and Mould. 

Cover the cheese while whole with a paste made 
of wheat flour, put a piece of paper or cloth over it, 
and cover it with the paste, keep it in a cool dry place. 
Cheese that has skippers in it, if kept till cold weath- 
er will be free from them. Cheese that is growing 
mouldy can be prevented from becoming any more 
so, by grating it fine and moistening it with wine, and 
covering it up in a jar. It is preferred by many peo- 
ple to that which is not grated. 

15. To keep Vegetables and Herbs. 

Succulent vegetables, are preserved best in a cool 
shady place that is damp. Turnips, potatoes, and 
similar vegetables should be protected from the air 
and frost, by being buried in earth ; in very severe 
cold weather, they should be covered with a linen 
cloth. It is said that the dust of charcoal will keep 
potatoes from sprouting, if sprinkled over them. 
Herbs should be gathered on a dry day, either just 
before or while in blossom ; they should be tied in 
bundles and hung in a shady airy place, with the 
blossoms downwards. When perfectly dry, put away 
the medicinal ones in bundles; pick off the leaves of 
those that are to be used in cooking, pound and sift 
them, and keep them in bottles corked tight.

16. To preserve various kinds of Fruit over winter* 

Apples can be kept till June, by taking only those 
that are perfectly sound, and wiping them dry, and 
putting them in barrels with a layer of bran to each 
layer of apples. Cover the barrel with a linen cloth 
to protect them from the frost. Mortar put on the 
top of the apples, is said to be an excellent thing to 
prevent their decaying, as it draws the air from them, 
which is the principal cause of decay ; the mortar 
should not touch the apples. To preserve oranges 
and lemons for several months, take those that are 
perfectly fresh, and wrap each one by itself in soft 
paper, and put them in glass jars, or a very tight box, 
strew white sand thickly round each one and over the 
top. The sand should be previously perfectly dried 
in the oven, several hours after baking in it. Cover 
the fruit up tight, and keep it in a cool dry place, but 
not so cold as to freeze it. To preserve grapes gath- 
er them on a dry day, when not quite dead ripe; pick 
those off from the stem, that are not perfectly fair, lay 
them in a glass jar and on each layer sprinkle a layer 
of dry bran, taking care that none of the grapes touch 
each other, have a layer of bran on the top of them, 
and cork and seal them tight. A box will do to keep 
them in if covered with mortar. To restore them to 
their freshness when they are to be eaten, cut the ends 
of the stalks and immerse them in wine, let them re- 
main in it for a few moments before they are to be 
eaten. Various kinds of green fruit, such as grapes, 
currants, gooseberries and plums, can be kept the year 
round by putting them in bottles, and setting them in 
an oven four or five hours after baking in it ; let them 
remain in it till they begin to shrink, then cork and 
seal them tight, they will be fit for pies, whenever you 
wish to use them. ' Ripe blackberries, and whortle- 
berries, dried perfectly in the sun, and tied up in bags

98 Miscellaneous Receipts. 

so as to exclude the air, will keep good over the win- 
ter. Whenever you wish to use them for pies, pour 
on boiling water enough to cover them, and let them 
remain in it till they swell to nearly the original size, 
then drain off the water, and use them. 

17. To extract essences from various kinds of flowers. 

Procure a quantity of the petals of any kind of flow- 
ers that have an agreeable fragrance. Card thin lay- 
ers of cotton, which dip into the finest Florence oil. 
Sprinkle a small quantity of salt on the flowers, and put 
a layer of them in a glass jar or wide mouthed bottle, 
with a layer of the cotton, put in a layer of each alter- 
nately until the jar is lull, then cover the top up tight 
with a bladder. Place the vessel in a south window, 
exposed to the heat of the sun. In the course of a 
fortnight, a fragrant oil may be squeezed from the cot- 
ton, little inferior if rose leaves are made use of, to the 
imported otto of rose. 

18. Indelible Ink for marking linen. 

Dissolve a drachm of lunar caustic, in half an ounce 
of pure cold water. Dip whatever is to be marked in 
pearlash water, dry it perfectly, then rub it smooth 
with a silver spoon, (ironing it sets the pearlash water,) 
write on it, and place it in the sun, and let it remain 
until the name appears plain and black. Red ink for 
marking linen, is made by mixing and reducing to a 
fine powder, half an ounce of vermilion, a drachm of 
the salt of steel, and linseed oil enough to render it of 
the consistency of black durable ink. 

19. Perfume Bags. . 

Rose leaves dried in the shade, and mixed with 
powdered cloves, cinnamon and mace, put in small 



Miscellaneous Receipts. 99 

bags and pressed, is a fine thing to keep in drawers 
of linen, to perfume them. 

20. Lip Salve. 

Dissolve a small lump of white sugar, in a table 
spoonful of rose water, clear water will do but is not 
as good. Mix it with a table spoonful of sweet oil, a 
piece of spermaceti of the size of half a butternut. 
Simmer the whole together about eight or ten minutes. 

21. Bread Seals. 

Take the crust of newly baked bread, moisten it 
with gum water and milk, add either vermilion in 
powder or rose pink, to color it. When moistened 
work it with the fingers till it forms a consistent paste 
without cracking ; it should then be laid in a cellar, till 
the next day. Then break jt into pieces of the size 
you wish to have the seals, warm and roll them into 
balls, press one at a time, on the- warm impression of a 
seal press. The bread should go into every part of the 
sealing wax impression; while the bread remains on it, 
pinch the upper part so as to form a handle, to hold the 
bread seal when in use. Take off the bread seal, trim 
all the superfluous parts, put the seals where they 
will dry slowly. The more the bread has been work- 
ed with the fingers, the more glossy and smooth will 
be the seals, and the better impression will they make. 



22. To loosen the Glass Stopples of Decanters or 
Smelling Bottles when wedged in tight. 

Rub a drop or two of oil with a feather round the 
stopple, close to the mouth of the bottle or decanter, 
then place it between one and two feet from the fire. 
The heat will cause" the oil to run down between the 
stopple and mouth. When warm strike it gently on 









100 Miscellaneous Receipts. 

both sides with any light wooden instrument, you may 
happen to have ; then try to loosen it with the hand. 
If it will not move, repeat the process of rubbing oil 
on it, and warming it. By persevering in this method, 
you will at length succeed in loosening it, however 
firmly it may be wedged in. 

23, Cement for broken China, Glass and Earthen- 
ware. 

To half a pint of skimmed milk, add an equal quan- 
tity of vinegar to curdle it, then separate the curd 
from the whey, and mix the curd- with the whites of 
five eggs, beat the whole well together, then add 
enough of the finest quicklime to form a consistent 
paste. (Plaster of Paris is still better if it can be pro- 
cured, than lime.) Rub this mixture on the broken 
edges of the china or glass, match the pieces and bind 
them tightly together, and let them remain bound sev- 
eral weeks. They will then be as firm as if never 
broken. Boiling crockery in milk is a good thing to 
cement them, the pieces should be matched, bound 
with pieces of cloth, and boiled half an hour, they 
should remain in the milk till cold, and not be used 
for several weeks. Pulverized quicklime mixed with 
the white of an egg and rubbed in the cracks of china 
and glass, will prevent their coming apart; the dishes 
should be bound firmly for several weeks, after it is 
rubbed in. The Chinese method of mending broken 
china, is to grind flint glass, on a painter's stone, as fine 
as possible, and then beat it, with the white of an egg 
to a froth, and lay it on the edges of the broken pie- 
ces. It should remain bound several weeks. It is 
said, that no art will then be able to break it in the 
same place. 

24. Japanese Cement or Rice Glue. 

Mix rice flour intimately with cold water, and then 
gently boil it. It answers all the purposes of wheat

flour paste, and is far superior in point of transparency 
and smoothness. This composition made with a com- 
paratively small proportion of water, that it may have 
the consistence of plastic clay, will form models, busts, 
statues, basso relievos and similar articles. The Jap- 
anese make fish of it which very much resemble those 
made of mother of pearl. Articles made of it when 
dry are susceptible of a very high polish. Poland 
starch, is a very nice cement, for pasting layers of pa- 
per together, and any fancy articles when it is neces- 
sary. 

25. Cement for Alabaster. 

Take of bees' wax one pound, of rosin half a pound, 
and three quarters of a pound of alabaster. Melt 
the wax and rosin, then strew the alabaster, previously 
reduced to a fine powder, over in it lightly. Stir the 
whole well together, then knead the mass in water, in 
order to incorporate the powder thoroughly with the 
rosin and wax. Heat the cement and the alabaster, 
which should be perfectly dry, when applied join and 
keep it bound a week. This composition when prop- 
erly managed forms an extremely strong cement. 

26. To Extract Fruit Stains. 

Hold the spot over steam till quite moist, then over 
burning sulphur; the sulphurous gas will cause the 
spot to disappear. 

27. To extract spots of paint from Silk, Woolen and 

Cotton Goods. 

Saturate the spots with spirits of turpentine, let it 
remain several hours, then take the cloth and rub it 
between the hands. It will crumble away and not 
injure either the texture or color of the cloth.

28. To remove Hack stains on Scarlet Merinos or 

Broadcloths. 

Wash the stain in water with a little tartaric acid in 
it, rinse it directly, and care should be taken not to 
get any of the acid water on the clean part of the 
dress. " Weak pearlash water is good to remove stains 
produced by acids. 

29. To remove grease spots from Paper, Silk or 

Woolen. 

Grate on chalk enough to cover the grease spots. 
French chalk is the best, but common chalk will an- 
swer very well. Cover the spots with brown paper, 
and set a warm flat iron on the top, and let it remain 
until cold. Care must be taken not to get the iron 
so hot as to change the color of the article. If the 
grease does not appear to be extracted, on removing 
the flat iron, grate on more chalk, and heat the iron, 
and put it on again. 

30. To extract stains from white Cotton goods and 

Colored Silks. 

Spots of common or durable ink, can be removed 
by saturating them with lemon juice and salt in sum- 
mer, and keeping them where the sun will shine on 
them several hours. Rub the juice and salt on them 
as fast as they get dry. Where lemons cannot be 
procured, tartaric acid dissolved in salt and water, is 
a good substitute. Iron mould can be removed in the 
same way ; it is said that spirits of salts diluted with 
water will also extract iron mould. Sal ammoniac 
with lime, will take out the stains of wine. Mildew 
and most other stains on white goods, can be removed 
by rubbing on soft soap and saltj and putting them in 



Miscellaneous Receipts. 103 

a hot summer's sun, it should be rubbed on as fast as 
it dries. Where this fails, lemon juice and salt will 
be generally effectual. Colored cotton goods that 
have ink spilt on them, should be soaked in lukewarm 
milk or vinegar; sour milk is the Jpest. Spirits of tur- 
pentine, alcohol or sal ammoniac, are all good to re- 
move spots from colored silks. 

31. Rules for washing Calicoes. 

Calicoes that incline to fade, can have the colors 
set by washing them with beef's gall in clear water 
previous to washing them in soap suds; a small tea cup 
full to a pail of water is the right proportion. By 
squeezing out the gall, and bottling and corking it up, 
it can be kept several months. A little vinegar in the 
rinsing water of calicoes, that have green, pink or red 
colors, will brighten them and prevent their mixing 
together. Yellow calicoes should be washed in soap 
suds and not rinsed. A little salt in the rinsins; water 

O 

of calicoes, particularly blues and greens, tends to 
prevent their fading by subsequent washing, it will al- 
so prevent their catching fire readily. Thin starch 
water is good to wash fading calicoes in, but it is rath- 
er hard to get them clean in it ; no soap is necessary. 
Calicoes should not be washed in very hot suds and 
soft soap should never be used, excepting for buff and 
yellows, for which it is the best. The two latter col- 
ors should not be rinsed in clear water. 

32. Rules for washing Silks. 

The water in which pared potatoes has been boiled, 
is an excellent thing to wash black silk in, it makes it 
look almost as black and glossy as new. Beef's gall 
in soap suds is also very good, and soap suds without 
the gall does very well. Colored silks should have 
all the spots removed before the whole of the article 



104 Miscellaneous Receipts. 

is wet. Put soap into boiling water and beat it till it 
is all dissolved, and forms a strong lather when at a 
hand heat, put in the article that is to be washed and 
if strong it may be rubbed hard ; when clean squeeze 
out the water without wringing, and rinse it in warm 
water. Rinse it in another water and for bright yel- 
lows, crimsons, maroons and scarlets, put in oil of vit- 
riol, sufficient to give the water an acid taste, for oran- 
ges, fawns, browns or their shades use no acids, for 
pinks, rose colors, and their shades, use tartaric acid, 
lemon juice or vinegar. For bright scarlet, use a so- 
lution of tin. For blues, purples, and their shades, 
add a small quantity of American pearlash, to restore 
the colors. Verdigris dissolved in the rinsing water 
of olive greens is good to revive the colors, a solution 
of copper is also good. Dip the silks up and down in 
the rinsing water, and take them out without wring- 
ing, and before they get perfectly dry fold them up 
tight and let them lay a few moments, then mangle 
them, if you have not a maneler. iron them on the 

J 

wrong side. A little isinglass, dissolved in the rinsing 
water of blondes and gauzes, is good to stiffen them. 

33. Rules for washing Woolens. 

If you do not wish flannels to shrink, wash them in 
two good suds, made of hard soap, then wring them 
out, and pour boiling water on them, and let them re- 
main in it till cold. A little indigo in the rinsing wa- 
ter of white flannels makes them look nicer. If you 
wish to shrink your flannels, wash them in suds made 
of soft soap, and rinse them in cold water. Colored 
woolens that incline to fade, should be washed with a 
little beef's gall in the suds. Cloth pantaloons look 
well washed with beef's gall in the suds; they should 
be pressed, when quite damp, on the wrong side. 



Miscellaneous Receipts. 105 

34. Rules for washing white Cotton Clothes. 

Table cloths that have coffee or any other stains on 
them, should have boiling water turned on them and 
remain in it till cold. The spots should be rubbed 
out before they are put in soap suds, or they will be set, 
so that they cannot be removed by subsequent wash- 
ing. If a little starch is put in the rinsing water, the 
stains will come out more easily the next time they are 
washed. Any white cloths, that have fruit stains on 
them, should be washed in the same manner. It is a 
good plan, to soap and soak very dirty clothes over 
night; put them in when the water is lukewarm, and 
let them heat gradually, if they get to boiling it will 
not do any harm. Where rain water cannot be pro- 
cured to wash with, a little lye in the proportion of 
half a pailful to seven or eight pails of hard water will 
soften it so that much less soap will be necessary. It 
is said that white clothes washed in the following man- 
ner will not need any rubbing. To five gallons of soft 
water, add half a gallon of lime water, a pint and a 
half of soap and a couple of ounces of the salts of so- 
da. Wet the clothes thoroughly and soak the parts 
that are most soiled ; if very dirty, they should be 
soaked over night. Heat the above mixture boiling 
hot, then put in the clothes, let them boil an hour, then 
drain and rinse them thoroughly in warm water, then 
in indigo water, and they are fit for drying. The 
soda can be procured cheap, by purchasing it in large 
quantiiies. It is a good plan to save the dirty suds 
after washing, to water your garden if you have one, 
it is also good to harden sandy cellars and yards. 

35. To clean Silk and Woolen Shawls. 

Pare and grate jaw potatoes, put a pint of it in two 
quarts of clear water. ' Let it stand for five hours, then 



106 Miscellaneous Receipts. 

strain the water and rub through as much of the po- 
tatoe as possible ; let it remain until perfectly clear, 
then turn off the water carefully. Put a clean white 
cloth on a table, lay the shawl on it and pin it down 
tight. Dip a clean sponge into the potatoe water and 
rub the shawl with it till clean, then rinse the shawl 
in clear water. When nearly dry, mangle it; if you 
have not a mangier, wrap it up in a clean white cloth 
and press it under a heavy weight till perfectly dry. 
All the grease spots and stains should be taken out of 
the shawls, before they are washed with the potatoe 
water. 

36. To clean Silk Stockings. 

Wash the stockings in mildly warm hard soap suds, 
rinse them in soap suds and if you wish to have them 
of a flesh color, put in a little rose, pink or cochineal 
powder; if you prefer a bluish cast, put in a little in- 
digo. Hang them up to dry without wringing, when 
nearly dry, iron them on the right side, till perfectly 
so. If you wish silks of any kind to have a gloss on 
them, never rinse them without soap in the water. 

37. To clean Carpets. 

Carpet? should be taken up as often as once a year, 
even if not much used, as there is danger of their get- 
ting moth eaten. If used much they should betaken 
up two or three times a year. If there is any appear- 
ance of moths when carpets are taken up. sprinkle a 
little black pepper or tobacco on the floor before the 
carpets are put down. Shake the dust out of the 
carpets, and if they are so much soiled as to require 
cleaning, rub a little dry magnesia or grated raw po- 
tatoes on them; the potatoes should be rubbed on with 
a new broom. Let it remain until perfectly dry before 
walking on it. If there*fcre any grease or oil spots on 



*. 



Miscellaneous Receipts. 107 

the carpet, they should be extracted before the potatoe 
is rubbed on. They can be extracted by grating on 
potter's clay, covering it with brown paper and a mod- 
erately warm flat iron or warming pan. It will be ne- 
cessary to do it several times to get out the whole of 
the grease. 

38. To clean Feather Beds and Mattresses. 

When feather beds become soiled or heavy, rub 
them over with a brush dipped into hot suds. When 
.-clean lay them on a shed or railing, where the rain will 
fall on them till they get thoroughly soaked, let them 
dry in a hot sun for a week, shaking and turning them 
over each day. This way of washing the beds makes 
the feathers fresh and light, and is much easier than 
the old fashioned way of emptying the beds, and wash- 
ing the ticking and feathers separately, while it an- 
swers quite as well. Hair mattresses that have be- 
come hard and dirty, can be made nearly as good as 
new ones, by ripping them and washing the ticking, 
picking the hair free from bunches, and keeping it in 
an airy place several days. When the ticking gets 
dry fill it lightly, and tack it together. 

39. To clean Light Kid Gloves. 

o 

Magnesia, moist bread and India Rubber, are all 
of them good to clean light kid gloves, if rubbed on 
thoroughly. 

40. To remove Ink or Grease spots from Floors. 

Ink spots can be removed by scouring them with 
sand, wet with water that has a few drops of oil of 
vitriol in it. Great care is 'necessary in using it, as it 
eats holes if suffered to retpain long without having 
something put on to countefkct its effects. When 



.-*- 



108 Miscellaneous Receipts. 

rubbed on floors, it should be rinsed off immediately 
with weak pearlash water. Oil and grease spots can 
be removed by grating on potter's clay thick and wet- 
ling it, it should remain on till it has absorbed all the 
grease ; if brown paper and a warm iron is put on, 
it vtill come out much quicker. Pearlash water and 
sand is also good to extract grease and oil, they should 
be rubbed hard, then rinsed directly. 

41. To clean Mahogany and Marble Furniture. 

They should be washed in water without any soap, 
A little oil rubbed on them occasionally gives them a 
fine polish. White spots on varnished furniture can 
be removed by rubbing them with a warm flannel 
cloth dipped in spirits of turpentine. It is said that 
ink spots can be extracted by rubbing them with blot- 
ting paper rolled up tight,^ 

42. To clean Stone Hearths and Stoves. 

If you wish to preserve the original color of free 
stone hearths, wash them in clear water, then rub them 
with a stone of the same kind pounded fine, let it re- 
main until dry, then rub it off. If the hearths are 
stained, rub them hard with a free stone. Hot soft 
soap or soap suds, does very well to wash hearths in, 
provided you have no objections to their looking dark. 
For brick hearths use redding mixed with thin starch 
and milk. Varnished stoves should tfave several coats 
of varnish put on in summer so as to get quite hard be- 
fore being used. They should be washed in warm 
water without any soap, a little stubbed on once or 
twice a week, improves the looks of them. Black 
lead is good to black stoves that have never been var- 
nished, but it will not do f where they have been. It 
should be rubbed on dry once or twice*'a day. 



Miscellaneous Receipts. 109 

43. To clean Brass. 

Rotten stone and spirit, is better than any thing else 
to clean brasses with. Acids make them look nice at 
first, but they will not remain clean long, they are also 
apt to spot without a great deal of care is used. When 
brass andirons are not in use, they should be thor- 
oughly cleaned with rotten stone, and rubbed over 
with oil, and wrapped up tight. 

44. To cleanse Trials and Pie Plates. 

Bottles and vials, that have had medicine in them, 
can be cleaned, by putting a tea spoonful or two of 
ashes in them and immersing them in cold water, the 
water should then be heated gradually until it boils. 
When they have boiled about half an hour, take them 
from the fire, and let them cool gradually in the wa- 
ter. Pie plates that have been baked on many times, 
are apt to impart an unpleasant taste to pies. It may 
be remedied by boiling them in ashes and water. 

45. Cautions relative to Brass and Copper. 

Cleanliness has been aptly styled the cardinal vir- 
tue of cooks ; food is not only more palatable cook- 
ed in a cleanly manner, but it is also more healthy. 
Many lives have been lost in consequence of careless- 
ness in using copper, brass and glazed earthen uten- 
sils. No oily or acid substance should be allowed 
to cool or stand in them. Brass and copper utensils 
should be thoroughly cleaned with salt and hot vine- 
gar before being 



46. To keep Pickle^ and Siveet Meats. 



Pickles should be kept in kege or unglazed earthen 
jars. Sweet meats keep best in glass jars, unglazed 

L 



110 Miscellaneous Receipts. 

earthen jars do very well. If the jar is covered with 
a paper wet in spirits, the sweet meats are less liable to 
ferment. Both pickles and sweet meats, should be 
looked to occasionally to see that they are not fer- 
menting, if so, the vinegar or syrup should be turned 
from them and scalded. If pickles grow soft, it is 
owing to the vinegar's not being strong enough : to 
make it stronger, scald it and put in a paper wet with 
molasses, and a little alum. 

47. Starch. 

To make good flour starch, mix the flour with a lit- 
tle water till free from lumps, thin it gradually with 
more water, then stir it slowly into boiling water. Let 
it boil five or six minutes stirring it frequently, a tal- 
low candle stirred round in it several times makes it 
smoother. Strain it through a thick bag. Starch 
made in this manner will be free from lumps, and an- 
swers for cotton and linen as well as Poland starch. 
Many people like it for muslins. Poland starch is 
made in the same manner as flour starch. When rice 
is boiled in a pot without a bag, the water that it is 
boiled in is as good as Poland starch for- clearing mus- 
lins, if boiled by itself a few moments and strained. 
Muslins to look very clear, should be starched and 
clapped while the starch is hot. 

48. To temper New Ovens and Iron Ware. 

New ovens before being used, to reta'in their heat 
well, should be heated half a day. The lid should be 
put up as soon as the wood is taken out. It should 
not be used to bake in the first time it is heated. Iron 
utensils are less liable to crack if heated gradually be- 
fore they are used. New flat irons should be heated 
Haifa day, to retain iheir h^at'vvell. 



Miscellaneous Receipts. Ill 

49. To temper Earthen Ware. 

Earthen ware that is used to cook in, is less liable 
to crack from the heat, by being put before they are 
used into cold water and heated gradually till the wa- 
ter boils, then taken from the fire and left in the water 
until cold. 

50. Preservatives against the Ravages of Moths. 

To prevent woolen and fur articles of dress, from 
getting moth eaten when you have done wearing them, 
put them in a chest with cedar chips, camphor gum 
or tobacco leaves. 

51. To drive away various kinds of Household Ver- 
min. 

A little quicksilver and white of an egg beat together 
and put in the crevices of bedsteads, with a feather, 
is the most effectual bed bug poison. A solution of 
vitriol is also a good thing rubbed on walls that are 
infested by them. Hellebore with molasses rubbed 
on it, is an excellent thing to kill cockroaches, and put 
round the places that they are in the habit of frequent- 
ing. Arsenic spread on bread and butter, and placed 
round in rat holes, will put a stop to their ravages very 
speedily. Great care is necessary in using all these 
poisons where there are children, as they are equally 
as fatal to human beings as vermin. The flower of 
sulphur sprinkled round places that ants frequent, will 
drive them away. Half a tea spoonful of black pep- 
per, one of sugar and a table spoonful of cream mixed 
and kept on a plate, in a room where flies are trouble- 
some will soon cause them to disappear. Weak brine 
will kill worms in gravel walks. They should be kept 
moist with it a week in the spring, and three or four 
days in the fall. ? 



112 Miscellaneous Receipts. 

52. To keep Meat in hot Weather. 

Cover it with bran, and keep it where there is a 
free circulation of air, away from the flies. A wire 
safe is an excellent thing to preserve meat from spoil- 
ing. 

53. To Prevent polished Cutlery from rusting. 

Knives, snuffers and other steel articles, are apt to 
rust when not cleaned frequently. To prevent it wrap 
them tight in coarse brown paper, when not in use. 
Knives and forks should be perfectly free from spots 
and well polished when not in use. They should also 
be wrapped up, each one by itself, so as to exclude 
the air. 

54. To melt Fat for Shortening. 

The fat of all kinds of meat, excepting mutton and 
hams, makes good shortening. Roast meat drippings 
and the liquor that meat is boiled in, should stand until 
cold to have the fat harden so that it can be taken off 
easily 4 Cut your scraps of fat into small pieces, and 
melt them slowly without burning, together with the 
fat from your drippings. When melted, strain it and 
let it remain until nearly cold, then pour in a little 
cold water. When the fat forms into a hard cake, 
take it up and scrape off the sediment that adheres 
to the under side, melt it again and when lukewarm 
sprinkle in a little salt. The dregs of fat are good for 
soap grease. This shortening answers all the various 
purposes of lard very well, excepting in the warmest 
weather. In using it for pies it is necessary to use 
considerable butter with it. The fat of meat should 
not be suffered to lie more than a week in winter 
without melting, and in summer not more than two or 
three days. Mutton fat and the fat of beef, if melted 
into hard cakes, will fetch a good price at the tallow

chandler's. It is much more economical for house- 
keepers to put down their own pork, than to buy it al- 
ready salted. The leaves and thin pieces that are 
not good for salting, should be cut into small bits and 
melted, then strained through a cullender with a cloth 
laid in it, as soon as it begins to thicken sprinkle in a 
tea cup of salt, to twenty^r thirty weight of the lard ; 
stir it in well, then set it away in a cool place. Some 
people have an idea that pork scraps must be fried 
till very brown in order to be preserved good the year 
round, but it is not necessary if salt is put in. 

55. To preserve Eggs fresh a Year. 

Mix a handful of unslacked lime with the same 
quantity of salt, two or three gallons of water. If 
eggs that are perfectly fresh are put in this mixture, 
they will keep good a year in it, provided none are 
cracked. 

56. To preserve Cream for long Voyages. 

Take cream that is fresh and rich, and mix it with 
half its weight of powdered white sugar, stir the whole 
well together, and preserve it in bottles corked very 
tight. In this state it is ready to mix with tea and 
coffee. 

57. Substitute for Milk and Cream in Tea or Coffee. 

Beat the white of a fresh egg in a bowl, and turn 
on to it gradually boiling tea or coffee. It is difficult 

to distinguish the taste from rich cream. 

^* - 

58. To Cure Butter. 

Take two parts of the best common salt, one part 
of sugar and one of saltpetre, blend the whole well 



114 Miscellaneous Receipts. 

together. Mix one ounce of this composition well 
with every sixteen ounces of the butter. Close it up 
tight in kegs, cover it with an oiled paper, and let it 
remain untouched for a month.' Butter cured in this 
manner is very nice, and will keep good eight or nine 
months, if not exposed to the air. 


59. To maJce salt Butter Fresh. 

Put four pounds of salt butter into a churn, with 
four quarts of new milk and a small portion of annatto. 
Churn them together, take out the butter in the course 
of an hour, and treat it like fresh butter, working in 
the usual quantity of salt; a little white sugar improves 
it. This is said to be equal to fresh butter in every 
respect. The salt may be got out of a small quantity 
at a time, by working it over in fresh water, changing 
the water several times. 

60. To take Ranknessfrom a small quantity of Butter. 

Take a quantity that is to be made use of, put it 
into a bowl filled with boiling water with a little sale- 
ratus in it, let it remain until cold, then take it ofFcare- 
fully and work it over with a little salt. By this meth- 
od it is separated from the grosser particles. 

61. Jfltndsor Soap. 

To make this celebrated soap for shaving and wash- 
ing the hands, nothing more is necessary than to slice 
the best white soap as thin as possible and melt it over 
a slow fire. When melted take it up, when lukewarm 
scent it with the oil of caraway or any other oil that is 
more agreeable, then turn it into moulds and let it re- 
main in a dry situation several days. It will then be 
fit for use.

62. To make Bayberry or Myrtle Soap. 

To a pound of bayberry tallow, put a pint of potash 
lye, strong enough 'to bear up an egg. Boil them to- 
gether "till it becomes soap. Then put in half a,. tea 
cup of cold water, lef^^oil several minutes linger. 
Take it off, and when psrfl^r cooled put in a few drops 
of the essence of wintergreen, pour it into moulds 
and let it remain several days. This soap is good for 
shaving, and is ae excellent thing for chapped hands 
an'd eruptions on the face. 

^ 63. Cold^Sowp. ^ N , 

> 

To twenty pounds of white potask put ten of grease, 
previously melted and strained. Mix it- well "together 
with a pailful of cold water, let it remain several days, 
then stir in several more pailsful of cold water. Con- 
tinue to pour in cold water at intervals of two or three 
days, stirring it up well each time. As soon as the 
water begins to thin it, it is time to leave off adding it. 
This method of making soap is much easier than any 
other, while it is equally cheap and good. If you 
have not land to enrich with your ashes they can be 
disposed of to advantage. at the soap boiler's.
