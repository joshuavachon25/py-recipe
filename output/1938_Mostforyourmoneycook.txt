FOREWORD 

Stretching the Food Dollar 

{Skip this if you're hungry; the real recipes begin in the next chapter) 



Since a third of the average family income goes for food, that's a 
logical front on which to combat the high cost of living. But it*s 
ridiculous even to consider reducing or unbalancing the diet by 
skimping or cutting it, especially the vitamins and calories. It 
should, instead, be expanded to include everything our bodies need 
all the way from the high chair to the coffin. And this can be done 
without enlarging the food budget, which in most cases can't take 
it anyway. For true cooking economy doesn't mean being tight or 
following the fallacious old Scotch maxim " Cook less and the family 
will eat less," but in learning the fullest use of all available foods 
and methods of getting the most out of them. Thrifty Europeans, 
who, as a rule, live better than we do on less, claim that we throw 
away more than we eat, and that comes too close to the truth to be 
any comfort to our intelligence. But even if we won't stop wasting 
and listening to the siren call of radio experts who sell us foodless 
food, blown up bran at half a dollar a pound and readymixed 
gingerbread that costs more to make than the finished cake would 
be at an honest baker's, we certainly can stretch the food dollar by 
countless culinary tricks, all of which are appetizing, healthful 
and interesting.

For instance, few cooks know the advantage of snow as an 
ingredient, yet a cup of freshly fallen snow actually takes the 
place of two eggs in making a pudding light and toothsome. Like- 
wise, snow saves on milk in mixing Snow Waffles and Pancakes 
which have a finer texture because of the chemicals released in 
melting — some say it's the ammonia. 

And anybody with access to a sunny window can cook jam and 
preserves at no cost, by using the sun's heat for fuel. Also, a cost- 
less, fireless cooker supplements the stove for dishes requiring long 
cooking. 

In lavish pioneer days our ancestors naturally went for the prime 
cuts, tenderloin and chops, and threw away the equally valuable 
giblets, kidneys, hearts and tidbits, all of which are quite as good 
for us as the calves' liver which doctors discovered a few years 
back and which, as a result of their prescribing it for anemia and 
such, shot up in price from ten to seventy cents a pound. The same 
thing happened with the sweetbreads butchers used to throw 
away because it was so hard to give them away. As for liver, lambs' 
liver still sells for 30^ a pound and is just as succulent as calves' 
at more than twice the price — we honestly prefer it, and get added 
satisfaction out of the saving. But calves' hearts, all meat and no 
waste and even tastier than the liver when well cooked, are still a 
drug on the butcher's block. For a dime we buy two of them, 
weighing well over a pound, and make them into ritzy dishes we 
wouldn't be ashamed to set before Oscar of the Waldorf. As a 
matter of fact, he'd probably prefer our Braised Hearts to Capon 
a la Financiered for chefs know what's what and their favorite 
food is raw hamburger — Beef Tartar, the fresh uncooked meat 
that can't be faked by cooking it "high" with onions. 

The insular English who never knew our abundance have always 
enjoyed frugal meat dishes such as "Bubble and Squeak" and 
"Toad in the Hole," while the epicurean French go for a dish 
of lungs, which we throw away. Kidneys, which we also neglect, 
are almost as much of a fetish with Englishmen as calves' liver 
with us, and when Englishmen travel — those who can afford 



STRETCHING THE FOOD DOLLAR 



to — they have frozen kidneys shipped out to them even in 
Egypt. 

We throw away chicken feet, while in Europe they're made into 
the very best Strassburg aspic we ever tasted. No other aspic is a 
scratch on it, even though it may cost ten times as much. Likewise 
blood sausage is popular abroad, while here they say pig*s blood is 
used chiefly to adulterate milk chocolate. And few of us believe 
what good Jewish cooks know, that chicken fat spread on bread is 
even tastier than butter. Pig*s feet we eat, but the cheaper and 
tastier French dish of "sheep's trotters" is still to be discovered. 
When common food prejudices are overcome, as they were recently 
in Iowa when roast crow went on the menu after "Make him eat 
crow" had been an insult for centuries, we increase our scope 
enormously. The "pickled green plums" our fathers turned up 
their noses at are now indispensable olives, shipped fresh, too, 
from California and pickled at home at a fraction of the bottled 
cost. And ever so much livelier. The wings of a skate, which we 
throw away, mean "rai au beurre noir" to Parisians and Londoners 
who are delighted to get them at a dollar a plate. While eels, of 
course, anywhere but here, sell for prohibitive prices, especially 
when smoked, in Dutch style. 

Honey, which needn't cost more per pound than plain sugar if 
bought at the source in family quantities, serves as a cheaper 
sweetener because you're likely to use less, or maybe because it's 
sweeter, and there's the added value of the flavor given to many 
cereals and desserts. The honey-handlers advise us to use less of 
it and get the full flavor by "drizzling" from a spoon instead of 
just pouring. This more appetizing method makes the honey jug 
do double duty for the same cost and can be extended to any 
syrup. Once you've drizzled you'll never go back to pouring. 

As for cereals, wheat frumenty and cornmeal mush stretch the 
breakfast dollar like rubber. In the wheatless and meatless days 
of the war, books came out with 1 50 different ways to cook corn, 
cheapest of our grains, and as a change, especially with new top-o'- 
the-table griddles and ovens, we can be our own hot biscuit bakers 
and put the saving on in the form of butter and maple syrup.

A few grains of buttered popcorn in a cream soup make it a 
different dish and the possibilities of a-dime-a-pound peanuts 
are practically unexplored. (One book contains 105 recipes for 
making fine peanut dishes.) And if you live where pecans are cheap, 
get a copy of 800 Proved Pecan Recipes. Lentils and Jerusalem 
artichokes are neglected but economical. Grade A buttermilk at 
}4 the price of Grade B fresh milk in many places is a whole- 
some substitute. Canned ripe pineapple is a better buy than fresh. 
Potatoes baked in their jackets are more nourishing than boiled 
(the roasted skin is the best part, once you learn to like it). The 
new spaghetti squash makes a big platter of vegetable spaghetti 
for half price and furnishes table talk for a week; even its tender 
seeds are more than edible. There's a free clamjuice cocktail in the 
juice of every half dozen clams, and besides, this juice and the soft 
parts of clams serve as oyster sauce at 50% discount, and many 
like it better. But mussels, tender and more digestible than clams, 
are disdained. Frogs and crayfish are used chiefly in Creole and 
French-influenced sections. Broiled salt codfish with garlic is a 
gourmetic delight. Evaporated milk is just as good as cream in 
some recipes, or in coffee — we know a woman's bowling team that 
voted 90% for this preference. By crushing a clove of garlic you 
release more flavor than by using two or three uncrushed. Inex- 
pensive Chinese soy sauce is the basis of most expensive bottled 
sauces. You can make your own anchovy essence for next to 
nothing, have green garnishings, bean sprouts and such growing 
without earth in a kitchen pan all winter. By saving celery leaves 
and drying them youVe got something better than celery salt, and 
half the value of watermelon is thrown away in the rind, a cinch 
to pickle — and do they like it! Same goes for orange and lemon 
skins to be kept for drinks and seasoning; kumquat skins actually 
are finer than the fruit. You can double the bulk of a fine butter 
to go with seafood by using cast off crayfish, crab and lobster shells. 

But by now you should be convinced, so let's to recipes, with 
one last word of explanation: 

Since this book aims to give the tastiest and most nourishing 
dishes at the lowest cost, the recipes are arranged under each 
heading according to their value in economy and quality combined. 



STRETCHING THE FOOD DOLLAR 



Thus the first recipes in each division are the best all around bar- 
gains, the most for your money, and the last ones, while just 
as acceptable and practical, will cost more, take more time and 
trouble, but may better please some individual tastes. In this way 
there should be enough variety to go around. 

The Authors 




I. Substantial Soup. 



In former days splendid vegetable soups, enriched by ten-cent 
beef bones — with plenty of meat left on them — simmered for 
hours on the back of coal ranges while washing, ironing and baking 
were going on. And were they good! Whole meals in themselves 
which built the sinew of our nation. Those were the days, too, 
when frugal housewives kept an iron "stock pot'* constantly stew- 
ing, into which they tossed all meat and poultry trimmings, ham 
bones and left-overs, to provide a continual supply of strong meat 
broth for soups and gravies. 

With the change from coal to gas and electricity in the kitchen, 
and with soup meat now as dear as beefsteaks used to be, these 
old-time comforts are in the luxury class today. In the modern 
American home, soup seldom appears at a simple family dinner, 
but is reserved for special occasions and then often only a little bit 
is served for show alone. The canned soup manufacturers are the 



lO MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

ones who now fatten on our soup needs, although some of them 
furnish us with fine quality and fair value. 

In Europe, however, the soup pot still bubbles, especially in 
France, in spite of the fact that most cooking over there is done on 
small fires of charcoal, or with faggots brought on the back from the 
roadside. But instead of abandoning their soups, they have in- 
vented a whole flock of delicious meatless varieties, mostly made 
out of things we throw away. These form the basis of the evening 
meal of the proletarian or petit bourgeois French family, and in 
smaller towns and villages the workman or peasant takes his steam- 
ing bowl and crusty honest hearth bread to the front stoop, where 
he consumes them at leisure, enjoying the air and conversation with 
passers-by at the same time. 

And here let us note that all soup tastes better out of a thick 
generous bowl which has been well heated in advance. The flavor 
will not escape, as it does from the large surface of a soup plate, 
and the last spoonful is as hot and good as the first. 

Many of the recipes which follow were gathered in a thrifty little 
town, on the Riviera, and some of them cost nothing at all beyond 
the trouble of putting them together, for they are made of the 
liquids in which vegetables have been cooked for a former meal. 
These liquids, rich in salts and vitamins, the French cook calls 
bouillons^ just as she does the broth in which meat has been boiled. 
And she doesn't waste a drop, for any vegetable pot liquor that 
doesn't go into the soup is used to thin the next meat gravy or 
furnish a sauce for some other vegetable. In making the gravy for a 
roast, for instance, the French housewife doesn't just reach for the 
teakettle or carelessly throw in some cold water, but tilts up the 
saucepan in which potatoes, peas, celery, or some other vegetable 
may be cooking, and adds to her roasting pan contents some of the 
well-flavored and nourishing vegetable juices. 

GREEN PEA — CELERY — CARROT SOUP 

Strain the liquids in which green peas, celery and carrots have 
been boiled. Put the green pea liquor in a saucepan and add celery 
liquor until its taste is clearly discernible. Then add carrot liquor 
until the flavor of the mixture is slightly sweet, remembering that 



SUBSTANTIAL SOUPS II 

carrots contain a large percentage of sugar and too much will make 
the soup unpalatable for some people. When the combination pleases 
your taste, add salt if necessary, a dash of cayenne, and heat to 
boiling. Cut stale slices of bread into cubes, fry brown in butter or 
bacon fat, lay in bottom of soup tureen or individual bowls and 
pour the soup over them. A few leftover peas, dropped in, add appe- 
tizing color. 

Three vegetables always make a better soup than two, but just 
carrots and peas will do, with the addition of a little celery salt. 

STRING BEAN AND POTATO SOUP 

In 1 tablespoons butter slowly cook a minced onion, but do not 
let it color. When tender add a tomato, either fresh or canned, and 
stir until it thickens. Then add the liquor in which about a pound of 
green beans have been boiled, and the water from 4-5 potatoes 
with a little of the potato, well mashed. Season with salt and pepper 
and pass all through a sieve. Reheat and serve. 

The water in which almost any green vegetable has been boiled 
may be used in this manner. Exceptions are the waters from bitter 
greens, egg plant and artichokes. {See page 12.) 

ASPARAGUS AND RICE SOUP 

Heat water in which asparagus has been boiled. Add ]>4 cup boiled 
rice. Or add 4 tablespoons uncooked rice, well-washed, and cook 
rapidly 20 minutes. Season, and add a tablespoon lemon juice or a 
few drops vinegar. Beat yolk of an egg or two in the bottom of a 
soup tureen, put in a tablespoon butter, and slowly stir the hot soup 
into this to make a frothing, appetizing dish. 

POTATO — CELERIAC — ONION SOUP 

Water from boiled potatoes, celeriac (celery root), and onions. 
Mix to your liking, being careful not to put in too much onion water. 
Throw in any left-over vegetables — beans, peas, cabbage, and 
tomato will make this soup all the richer. Heat to boiling, press all 
through a sieve. Cut 2-3 slices of bacon into tiny squares (kitchen 
shears are handy for this) and fry crisp; scatter on top of soup when 



12 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

served. Save bacon grease for other frying. A teaspoon of minced 
parsley or other herb helps both appearance and taste. 

The above recipes suggest a few of the dozens of combinations 
which can be made. The only vegetable broths we never save are 
from artichokes and eggplant, and from certain bitter greens like 
dandelion. Of course the vegetables must have been carefully 
cooked if the cooking water is to be good in soup. (See recipes for 
vegetables.) For instance, onions should always be parboiled, the 
first water thrown away and only the second water saved. And one 
must be especially careful in preparing cabbage; only the liquid 
from young cabbage is fit to be mixed with delicate vegetables, and 
the cabbage must be cut into quarters or eighths and dropped into 
rapidly boiling water; it should be cooked only 15-20 minutes, un- 
covered; boiled in this manner the broth alone, stirred well with a 
little butter and seasonings, is delicious and has a flavor that sug- 
gests delicate chicken broth. 

BRUSSELS SPROUTS SOUP 

Cook a quart of Brussels sprouts in salted boiling water, leaving 
the cover off the saucepan so they will retain their bright color. 
Save the cooking water. After serving them as a vegetable, heat any 
left-over sprouts in 2 tablespoons of butter, shaking the pan; 
sprinkle them with flour, have the water in which they were cooked 
boiling hot, throw them into it, cook 5 minutes, then press all 
through a sieve. Bring to boiling point again and pour over 2 egg 
yolks beaten with yi cup milk. Serve at once. 

Onions, potatoes and leeks combine well with Brussels sprouts; 
and a soup made in the proportion of 2 sliced onions, 4 diced po- 
tatoes, 2 chopped leeks and 2 cups of Brussels sprouts is a common 
family dish in Belgium. When all are tender the soup is pressed 
through a sieve, seasoned, and sprinkled with minced parsley. 

VEGETABLE CREAM SOUPS 

Any vegetable bouillon is quickly made into cream soup by blend- 
ing 2 tablespoons of flour in 2 tablespoons of melted butter, and then 
slowly stirring in 2 cups of fresh milk, or evaporated milk thinned 



SUBSTANTIAL SOUPS I3 

with water; cook slowly, stirring constantly, until thick. Add 2 cups 
of vegetable bouillon and a little of the vegetable, and season with 
salt and pepper. Stir and cook until well mixed. Serve boiling hot. 
This is a good way to use up the small quantities of liquids from 
canned vegetables. 

PEA POD SOUP 
Wash young, tender peas before shelling, and put the pods in 
boiling water with a sprig of parsley, several lettuce leaves and a 
sliced onion. Cook uncovered until tender and press through a sieve. 
Season with salt, pepper and a very little sugar. Add any left-over 
peas after straining, and heat to boiling.

fry for a moment only. Then add water, and the clove, parsley and 
celery tied together with a thread so they may be easily removed 
at the end. Cook until vegetables are soft, remove the celery, pars- 
ley and clove, and press vegetables and liquor through a fine sieve.

Reheat, but do not let boil. Beat egg yolk with milk and add 
slowly, stirring soup all the time. More butter may be added if you 
like. Pour over cubes of fried bread, or add a little left-over rice 
during cooking.

sieve. Add milk and seasonings. Stir while keeping at boiling tem- 
perature, but do not boil. Add egg yolks, stir until yolks are well 
incorporated, taking care that they do not curdle. Eat with oyster 
crackers.

Scrape i bunch of salsify, slice and throw slices for a few minutes 
into water acidulated with a tablespoon of vinegar. Drain and cook 
in boiling salted water until tender. Stir in i can evaporated milk, 
add white pepper and i teaspoon paprika, lay two tablespoons 
butter on top, and continue to stir until butter melts. When boiling 
hot it is ready to eat and tastes like oyster stew. It will be richer, 
however, if poured over two egg yolks which have been beaten with 
a tablespoon of cold water.

Scrape carrots, quarter them and cut out the pale centers; dice 
the rest and cook with onion and celery in butter until they begin 
to color. Add broth and simmer until tender. Strain and press 
through a fine sieve. Put back over flame and stir until well incor- 
porated. Add sugar, cream, salt, pepper and the noodles, which 
have been kept hot. 

If you hke raw carrots you might munch one with this. 

ONION SOUPS 

Basic Onion Soup is very simply made: 

Slice onions thin, saute golden brown in butter, pour hot water 
on, using ^ more than the quantity of soup you want. Cook until 
tender. Season with salt and freshly ground pepper, lay slices of 
toasted French bread or rolls on bottom of tureen and pour soup 
over them. Have a saucer of grated cheese handy for sprinkling on. 
Good imported Gruyere is best for this. 

Or fill the soup plates, float toast on, cover it with cheese and 
brown quickly under grill. 

Some recipes call for cloves, mace, parsley, and a poached egg in 
each bowl. Others are thickened with cream and meat broth, spiced 
with vinegar and garlic. None are quick soups. 

There are two colors of Onion Soup, white and brown: 

WHITE ONION SOUP

Saute onions in butter for i hour, without browning, then add 
bread crumbs, milk and broth; cook 45 minutes more and put ev- 
erything through a fine sieve. Heat, season and stir in grated cheese. 

BROWN ONION SOUP 

Made same as White Onion Soup, except onions are browned 
with diced bacon and cooked a little longer before straining. 



SUBSTANTIAL SOUPS I7 

Cream of Onion Soup is made with white sauce and the water in 
which cauliflower or celery has been boiled, or you might like a can 
of creamed vegetable soup instead. The sauted onions are cooked 
in this; cream or evaporated milk and seasonings are added at the 
end and cheesed toasts floated in. 

Fried croutons give zest to any onion soup, and the simpler the 
soup is made the better it is. You can get cozy brown bean pots at 
the five-and-ten from which to sup this soup piping hot in true tra- 
dition. The imported ones, costing a dime in France, are a dollar 
here in the specialty shops.

sieve; season with sugar and cayenne; heat to boiling, stirring con- 
stantly. Serve at once with two or three fresh cress leaves in each 
plate. If desired, the soup may be further thickened with a table- 
spoon of flour stirred smooth in a little milk or cold water. 

BORSCHT 

The low-down on borscht is that it's any beef or beefless soup, 
with beets, cabbage, carrots and potatoes, eaten hot or cold, with 
or without sour cream. But borscht is made differently in every 
section of that broad beet belt stretching all the way through Rus- 
sia, Poland and adjoining territories, so there's not much good in 
giving just a recipe or two to stand for all the hundreds of varieties. 
Besides, most borscht takes hours to prepare, so the practical 
thing to do when you get a yen for it is to slip into the handiest

Russian restaurant, where you can get a whole kettle full, with sour 
cream. 

When borscht is made of fermented beet juice, it takes a lot of 
beating, just as German sauerbraten does when done in beer vine- 
gar, but who's got time to fix either of these today? We only wish 
we knew of a good canned beet soup to recommend. A Russian 
friend of ours, Anna Sherover, makes a famous ]4. hour soup, and 
it's the best borscht in uptown New York, anyway on the West side.

a slice of stale bread 15 minutes before straining; if too thick, add 
boiling vegetable bouillon, that is, the water in which potatoes, or 
any green vegetables are cooking. Or vegetable bouillon may be used 
from the beginning in place of some of the water. Stir vigorously

MUSSELS 

Oysters and scallops, so plentiful not long ago that they were 
ladled out by the quart and the gallon, are now nearly prohibitive 
by the piece and the pound. The lobsters, with which our wickedly 
exploited sea bottoms once swarmed, are charged for by the price 
makers, who prefer the present shortage, as if those ugly horny 
crustaceans were angels from heaven. And they are rapidly growing 
scarcer, for unscrupulous bootleggers catch and market under- 
ground the undersized ones, disregarding laws which aim at con- 
servation. 

It has not been so easy to restrict prices and keep down the supply 
of clams, however, since anyone living along certain sections of our 
coast can dig in unguarded mud flats for them, or let down a hand 
dredge from a row boat and bring up a rich haul. Although in city 
markets the price of Little Necks and Cherry Stones, delivered in 
the half shell on cracked ice, rivals that of expensive oysters, other 
varieties just as delicious to cook remain within reach. Pushcarts 
can still handle them. Steamers and some of the hard shells are of- 
fered for bait and chumming to amateur fishermen at two dollars 
or less a bushel, and are even included in the trip price on the pop-

ular deep sea fishing boats which furnish a day's sport to a fisher- 
man for two bucks, giving him the chance to reimburse himself 
with at least two dollars worth of the fish he has hooked. 

For some reason great beds of sea mussels lie untouched and un- 
marketed all along the shores of both our oceans. They are the 
cheapest of seafood and as delicious as any, in their way as distinc- 
tive for cooking as oysters, and much more digestible than clams. 
Billions of them, hundreds of millions of pounds, are consumed on 
the other side, where they appear on menus, especially in France, 
done in dozens of delightful ways. 

Yet in America they are for sale only in Paddy's and Tony's 
markets where Latins and Holland Dutchmen eagerly hunt them 
down. Their freshness is judged like that of other shellfish, that is, 
the shells must be tightly closed by the living membranes of the 
creature within. They must look clean and wholesome and smell of 
the sea. If you are gathering them yourself, make sure the water 
they live in is unpolluted with city sewage, and do not take them 
from copper bound wrecks or off the piling of wharfs. In other words, 
be as careful about the place they are taken from as you would be if 
digging clams. 

Let them lie in fresh water to discharge any sand, then wash and 
scrub the shells. Pull off the hanging tendrils before cooking and 
discard the very visible little black beards before eating. 

STEAMED MUSSELS 

(i) -Steam and serve like clams, with a cup of the broth beside 
each plate and a dish of melted butter in which to dip each mussel. 
Or, (2) simmer a chopped onion, with perhaps a bit of garlic, in 
Yi tablespoons of oil or butter, but do not let it color; add a 
cut-up tomato, and simmer; add an herb bouquet (see recipe under 
Season It!) and i}4 cups boiling water and simmer until well 
blended. Pour the mussels into the pan, cover closely, and steam 
until they open; continue to steam for 5 minutes longer; take mus- 
sels from shells, place in a hot dish and pour liquid over. 

The broth may be used at one meal for soup, like clam broth, 
and the steamed mussels may appear at another, reheated in a

cream sauce made with half milk, or cream, and half mussel liquor. 
They may also be fixed h la Newburg, or be done into fritters, or 
croquettes. Cold, they make a very good salad: Drain well, mix with 
thinly sliced celery, and then with mayonnaise or salad dressing, 
and serve on lettuce leaves. 

PICKLED MUSSELS 

Take steamed mussels from shells, lay them in a dish with a 
chopped onion, a chopped carrot, a bit of garlic, half a dozen pep- 
percorns, salt, a dash of cayenne and a clove or two. Pour over 
them a very little olive oil, and shake the dish until all are well 
settled together. Then cover with a mixture of half vinegar and half 
mussel broth. Let stand 3-4 hours. Serve in the mussel shells, one 
or two pickled mussels in each half shell, scattering over them a 
little of the onion and carrot drained out of the pickling liquor. 

BAKED MUSSELS 

Steam the mussels, leave each one lying on a half shell. Mix into 
a lump of butter all the minced parsley and chives it will take. 
Spread a teaspoonful of the mixture on each mussel and place in 
oven or under grill until sputtering hot. A layer of coarse salt in 
the bottom of the pan, to imbed the shells, will keep them steady 
and level so that the butter does not spill while heating, and will 
hold the heat when they are brought to the table in the pan. 

FRIED MUSSELS 

Drain and dry steamed mussels; discard beards; season with pep- 
per and a very little salt. Roll in egg and then in crumbs, and 
quickly brown in fat. Serve with quartered lemon.

CLAMS 

Soft clams not only have a thinner shell than hard ones, but have 
a larger proportion of soft meat inside of them. The tough muscle 
called the "neck" of both hard-shell, Little Necks and soft-shell 
steamers is really a foot by which the creatures propel themselves, 
and since the shells open to extend this foot they often close 
abruptly, especially when the clams are alarmed by diggers, and 
thus take in considerable sand. So they should be allowed to lie in 
cold water for several hours to give them a chance to expel not only 
sand but any other extraneous matter they may have picked up. 
They will make more of an effort to do this if some cornmeal is 
sprinkled into the water for them to eat.

Let clams lie in cold water, wash well and scrub shells with a

meats from shells, remove any tough ends of necks, lay hard parts 
on a board and chop fine with a sharp knife. Dice pork and fry, 
strain out pork and slowly fry onions in fat until golden. Barely 
cover potatoes with boiling water and cook for 5 minutes and drain. 
Place pork in bottom of a kettle, and lay in alternate layers of po- 
tatoes, onions, crumbled crackers, and chopped hard parts of clams. 
Tie spices together in a bit of cloth so they may be removed at the 
finish. Cover with strained clam juice and simmer until potatoes 
are done. Add soft parts of clams and cook 3 minutes. 

There are several schools of chowder makers from as many parts 
of New England, where Indian squaws first taught pioneer house- 
wives to make this dish. Some add heated milk just before putting 
in the soft parts of the clams, some thicken at the end with flour 
rubbed into butter and omit the pilot crackers, and some use a can

from oyster bargemen who rake in those prime Prince Edward 
Island oysters for the owners and still manage to get some for them- 
selves. They're big, tangy, firm, fat oysters, and some of the sea- 
food specialists used half cream and half milk for their stew, while 
others put }i cream to ^ milk and got a good balance. This far- 
north method differs from the usual stew in first cooking the oys- 
ters in a little of their own liquor, with salt and a few grains of 
cayenne. You heat the cream and milk together just under the 



SHELLFISH, STEWS AND CHOWDERS 35 

boiling point, but first heat the oysters by themselves until their 
edges begin to curl (60 seconds boiling will do that). Then dump 
the creamy mixture in, with a tablespoon of butter, plenty of 
paprika (or fresh ground black pepper) and maybe some celery salt. 
Stir lightly so the delicate bivalves won*t get bruised. Let the stew 
heat almost to boiling and then eat it right out of the pan, if you*re 
by yourself, and crunch with it just one grandpa pilot cracker in 
full harmony. Evaporated milk will serve in place of the cream, but 
the stew won*t be as fine in flavor. 

At times shrimp are very reasonably priced. Local seasons are 
short, but with modern methods of refrigeration they may be 
shipped considerable distances and remain perfectly wholesome. 
Like all other sea foods, however, they are dangerous when not ab- 
solutely fresh and should never be purchased if they have begun to 
take on a pinkish hue. 

TOASTED SHRIMP 

Wash shrimp very carefully and let lie for 15 minutes in plenty 
of fresh water, for sand to fall out. Thoroughly dry in a folded towel, 
sprinkle with salt and cayenne. Heat oil to the depth of yi inch in 
thick frying pan; when near to smoking drop in the shrimp, reduce 
heat somewhat and fry brown, first on one side and then on the 
other. They are very quickly done and should be taken up before 
the meat begins to shrink inside the shells. Eat at once, from hot 
plates, each person shelling his own and using his fingers freely, for 
the elegance lies in the flavor and not in table manners. Shrimps 
are so engrossing that no other food is served with them, but a 
nourishing salad may follow. The oil in which they cooked should 
be saved to impart a delicious flavor in frying other fish. 

BOILED SHRIMP 

Wash well, letting them lie for a time in deep fresh water, so any 
sand will fall out. Then cook like crabs for only 10 minutes. Cool in 
the liquid, drain and shell them. They are now ready to be eaten 
cold with mayonnaise, or to be made into any one of the dozens of 
dishes which have been devised for them.

BAKED SHRIMP 

Make a thickish white sauce, arrange a layer of boiled, shelled 
and seasoned shrimp in a greased baking dish, then a layer of sauce, 
and repeat until all shrimp are used; finishing with a layer of sauce. 
Sprinkle with crumbs, lightly dust with grated cheese, dot with 
butter and brown in the oven. 

SHRIMP IN TOMATO SAUCE 

Make tomato sauce thus: Fry a small chopped onion in i table- 
spoon oil or butter, add a little minced garlic, then two large to- 
matoes, a bit of bay leaf, celery leaves or minced celery salt, and a 
good dash of cayenne. Simmer until thick, stirring frequently. Add 
a dozen large boiled and shelled shrimp, or more small ones. Heat 
for lo minutes and serve. The seeds may be strained out of the 
tomato sauce before adding shrimp, but this is not necessary. This 
dish is very good if sprinkled with crumbs, dotted with butter, and 
browned in the oven.

Prepare shrimp according to recipe for Boiled Shrimp. Fry onion 
very slowly in butter until golden, add garlic, but do not let it 
brown; add tomato and simmer until thick. Add water, celery sprig, 
and seasonings; when boiling rapidly, add the shrimp. When boil- 
ing fast again, slowly add the rice, which has been washed through 
many waters, and stir all together. Cover closely and cook 30-45 
minutes, stirring occasionally at first with a wooden spoon, but not 
touching it after the rice grains have swollen. When thick, lower 
heat so bottom does not scorch and finish over an asbestos ring or a 
kettle of boiling water. 

Crabs caught in traps near shore, or fished for at resorts with a 
bit of salt pork tied to the end of a piece of string, are not so good 



37 

as those brought in from the deep sea fishing grounds. But, as a 
matter of fact, there is not much of a market for any of them, for the 
public prefers tinned crabmeat. Luscious big chunks of giant crab, 
put up by unexploited labor, come to us from the Soviet Union's 
clean northern waters of Kamchatka. But more frequently encoun- 
tered are those picked out by patient Japanese hands at nearly 
nothing a day, which cost more at that, after freight and import 
duty are added, than live crabs that have not only the advantage of 
being fresh but of carrying on their backs their own dainty shells 
to serve them in. They are a bit tedious to prepare and that's the 
only reason they remain cheap, but the trouble is well worth while, 
since they are of finer flavor even than lobster. 

BOILED CRABS 

Into 2 quarts of boiling water throw half a dozen celery sprigs, 
half a dozen sprigs of parsley, a dozen allspice, a dozen peppercorns 
and a sliced onion. Cover and boil rapidly for 10-15 minutes. Then 
drop in a dozen well-washed crabs, or less if large. Clamp on the 
cover and cook exactly 10 minutes. Drain, and cool. Take oflF the 
loose shell or apron which lies underneath, remove the side "fin- 
gers," br ak open, and pick out white meat from body and claws. 
Everything is edible except the spongy gills and the stone bag in 
the head. The coral, if any, is good too. The meat is now ready for 
cocktails or salads, for creaming, scalloping, or for devilled crabs. 

DEVILLED CRABS 

Mix equal portions of melted butter and flour. Add milk until a 
thick, soft paste is made. Add a dash of paprika and a few drops of 
Worcestershire. Cook the mixture over a slow flame for 20-30 min- 
utes. Add crabmeat. Fill crab shells with generous portions. Cover 
the top with buttered bread crumbs, and place under a low flame 
for about 3 minutes, or until the crumbs are browned. Remove to 
plates, placing a sprig of parsley on top of each. This recipe is often 
enriched by a hard-cooked egg or two, whites chopped and yolks 
pressed through a sieve to make the sauce yellow. A tablespoon or 
so of onion juice and a dash of nutmeg are good additional season- 
ings.

STUFFED CRABS 

To each cup of crab meat add Vi cup fine bread crumbs, and yi 
cup strained cooked tomatoes. If too dry add a little of the liquid 
in which crabs cooked. Season with salt, pepper, and a tablespoon 
of onion juice. Stir in two tablespoons melted butter. Fill the crab 
shells, sprinkle with crumbs, dot with butter, brown in the oven 
and eat hot. 

CRAB CROQUETTES 

Shred two cups of crab meat. Add Vt. cup evaporated milk, and 
enough bread crumbs to make very stiff. Stir in i egg, well beaten, 
season, heat for a moment and cool. Shape into croquettes, dip in 
egg and crumbs and fry in deep fat, or pat out into cakes and pan 
fry. 

CRABMEAT IN TOMATO SHELLS 

Peel tomatoes, hollow them out, and fill cavities with crabmeat 
mixed with salad dressing or mayonnaise; set each on a lettuce leaf. 
Or, hollow out tomatoes to thin shells; cook what has been taken 
out until it*s thick, strain, add crabmeat, season with salt and 
pepper, and a little catsup; fill shells with mixture, sprinkle with 
crumbs, dot with butter and bake. 

Soft-shell crabs only remain in that state two or three days, 
from the time they shed their old shell until the new one has 
hardened. Because of the shortness of the time and the necessity 
for quick handling, they are always a luxury, unless you can catch 
them yourself. 

SOFT-SHELL CRABS, FRIED 

Clean thoroughly a half dozen soft-shell crabs, brush them 
lightly with olive oil, season with i teaspoon pepper and i table- 
spoon salt, dip lightly in flour, then in beaten egg and lastly in 
sifted cracker crumbs. Fry a delicate brown in plenty of oil or fat, 
turning once. Set on a whole slice of toast, garnish with fried pars- 
ley and eat with Tartar sauce.

This is a good soup, but it can scarcely compare with the succu- 
lent She-Crab Soup of Charleston, South Carolina, which is en- 
riched by the roe.

DEVILFISH OR OCTOPUS 

Undoubtedly the devilish appearance of this creature is against 
it, but the octopus is no more rapacious than dozens of innocent 
looking members of the finny tribe who live by preying upon their 
fellow fish. Mediterranean peoples share none of our romantic 
concern over the character of the octopus, but make many regular 
dishes out of its tentacles. Its popularity increases as one travels 
eastward; devilfish is the daily fare of Greeks, Turks, and the 
coast-dwelling nations of Western Asia. 

Select a smallish one, since the bigger the octopus the tougher it 
is, an old specimen requiring 5 hours to cook. Have fish dealer re- 
move eyes and mouth, wash well, and let lie under dripping fresh 
water for at least an hour. Then beat well with a meat mallet or 
heavy wooden ladle, just as you would a tough beefsteak. Cut the 
tentacles in ^-inch slices. Blanch in boiling water until skin loosens, 
drain, take off skin, and wipe with a cloth. Fry a minced onion in 
oil over low heat, add the fish, stir and cook very gently; add a 
chopped tomato, stir and cook a few minutes, then pour in 2 
quarts hot water, cover and cook slowly for half an hour, add an 
herb bouquet, salt, pepper, and a medium onion pierced with 2 
cloves. Cook gently for an hour, take out onion and bouquet, 
increase heat, and add 2 cups well-washed rice. Keep boiling rap- 
idly, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon until rice is swollen; 
then reduce heat to prevent burning, and finish cooking rice until 
tender. This serves a big family, and the meat resembles lobster. 



QUEER FISH 4I 



The French, after preliminaries as above, marinate the blanched 
and skinned slices for 4-5 hours with herbs and X cup brandy or 
other strong spirits, then simmer in sour white wine with onion, 
tomato and garlic, serving the fish in its own gravy. And in Mar- 
seilles this is an epicurean delight. 

SQUID 

Amateur deep-sea fishermen are invariably surprised to hear that 
the squid they use for bait are very good eating. Along the New 
England coast the lights of small boats twinkle over the water every 
calm night, jigging for these little creatures which come in swarms 
toward a lantern, to be impaled on jigger poles bristling with hooks. 
Fishing trawlers use up the bulk of this catch, for bigger fish 
cannot resist them. But small quantities find their way to the fish 
stands and are consumed by immigrants from the Mediterranean 
who know many swell ways of preparing them for the table. They 
are most entertaining when stuffed, for their hollow bodies are 
natural pockets for tasty dressings. 

Choose medium-sized squid and have the dealer clean them of 
their center cartilage, and the ink sack, out of which Spaniards 
make a black sauce that can be appreciated only after a little 
education. (They call this dish "squid cooked in its own ink.") 
Wash them thoroughly, cut off tentacles and keep them separate 
while you lay the bodies out to dry on a cloth. Then finely mince 
the tentacles; gently fry a minced onion in oil, add the minced 
tentacles and 1-2 chopped tomatoes, a chopped garlic clove, sea- 
sonings, and herbs. Stir and simmer. Add suflicient bread, which 
has been soaked in milk and squeezed dry, a teaspoon of minced 
parsley, and a beaten egg. Mix well and stuff the squid pockets ^ 
full, closing the open ends and tying each with thread. Heat a 
tablespoon of oil in a pan, or better, an earthen casserole, lay in 
squid side by side, and gently cook while you make a sauce by 
frying a second minced onion and garlic clove, then adding a 
tablespoon of flour, i}4 cups water, juice of a lemon, a bay leaf 
and seasonings. Cook sauce for a few minutes, pour over the squid 
and simmer gently until done. They may be covered with oiled 
crumbs and finished by browning in oven or under grill.

Conger eel and skate are invariably thrown away by Americans 
who go deep sea fishing — just another example of prejudice 
founded on nothing more than the looks of these two fantastic 
fish. They can be had for the asking along our seashores, and sell 
for a song at the pushcart markets. The conger is so esteemed down 
the West Coast of South America, however, that infinite pains are 
taken to prepare it for banquets, while the skate is highly prized 
in every country but our own. Both taste more like sea food than 
ordinary fish, and thus will accept plenty of seasoning. 

Conger may be stewed, baked, or fried.

SALT CODFISH BALLS 

Cut salt cod in pieces, soak an hour in lukewarm water, remove 
skin and bones, shred coarsely with a fork. Put over fire in cold 
water, bring to the boiling point, drain and repeat. Have ready 
twice as much bulk of hot mashed potatoes seasoned with pepper 
and enriched with butter or margarine (we use Nucoa). Mix 
thoroughly, make into cakes, dredge with flour and fry. If you 
wish to cook them in deep fat, add a well-beaten egg and form into 
balls between the cupped hands. In foreign groceries codfish is cut 
off the whole salted fish and sold by the pound. It is much more 
economical than packaged shredded fish and, needless to say, 
much more tasty. On Fridays in any foreign neighborhood, salt cod 
can be purchased already soaked, ready for cooking.

Dip again in fresh water and drain on a napkin, or dry 2 or 3 
minutes in a hot oven. Slice the onion and garlic and saute in the 
fat until tender, being careful not to burn them. In the meantime 
peel and chop the tomatoes, and stew them in their own juice 10 
or 15 minutes, then strain through a sieve and add; stir well and 
add the parsley; salt and stir again; add pepper, the olives and 
capers. Put the cod into the casserole, cover and simmer gently for 
20 minutes. Serve in the casserole. 

COD'S HEAD AND SHOULDERS 

A cod*s tail cooks much more quickly than the thicker part 
of the body. If a whole fresh fish is purchased, cut it in two close 
to the vent. Slice and fry the tail, stuff and bake or boil the head 
and shoulders. Be sure to take home the liver, for it is considered 
a great delicacy, besides furnishing the valuable vitamin contained 
in its oil. The fish dealer is playing a scurvy trick when he sells 
beheaded and emptied fish, for the customer not only is being de- 
prived of valuable nourishment, but has no way of determining 
whether the fish is fresh. Cod's cheeks are the best part, and the 
sound, or swimming bladder, is a gourmet trifle, providing it is 
large enough to be worth cooking separately. 

A fine cod is round and fat near the tail, the hollow behind the 
head is deep, and the sides are ribbed or undulating. A fresh one is 



FISH IN EVERY FASHION 45 

elastic and the dent made by poking with the finger will rise at once; 
and when cut, the surface takes on a bronzed appearance. 

Remove the sound and save it; scrape and scrub all blood from 
back bone, remove every vestige of the gills and thoroughly clean 
inside of neck. All the cod family, whiting, hake, pollack and ling, 
should be immersed in cold water under a dripping tap for half an 
hour to firm the flesh, then they should be well dried, salted and 
set aside to further harden them. 

Make a tasty dressing of bread crumbs soaked in milk and 
squeezed dry, melted fat, a grated onion, a tablespoon of minced 
parsley, a pinch of dried herbs, minced celery or celery salt, the 
chopped sound, and anything else at hand — minced clams, oys- 
ters, mussels, or 2-3 minced mushrooms, either fresh or dried. Sea- 
son fish with pepper and paprika, stuff and sew the opening. If the 
fish is to be boiled, carefully season the water with onion, celery, 
bay leaf, 1-2 tablespoons of lemon juice or vinegar, salt and pepper- 
corns, and boil >^ hour to extract these flavors before putting in 
the fish and its liver. Lay it on a rack or wrap in cheese cloth, have 
just enough water to cover it, and simmer at a low bubble, never 
letting it boil fast. If it be baked, set on a rack, gash the skin in a 
number of places, fill gashes with butter, fat, or bacon slivers, 
brush with butter, sprinkle with crumbs, and after baking 15 
minutes in a very hot oven, reduce heat to moderate. While oven 
is cooling make a basting sauce with 2 cups boiling water, >i cup 
bacon fat or butter, 2 tablespoons vinegar or lemon juice, 2 table- 
spoons grated onion, and Yz teaspoon minced herbs. Beat sauce to 
mix, spoon half of it over the fish, being careful not to dislodge the 
crumbs, and baste every 15 minutes, adding rest of sauce when 
needed. Add the liver during basting, and mash some of it into the 
gravy. This is a general method for boiling and baking all fish. 

The dried mushrooms sold by Italian grocers are splendid to 
have on hand. They are very light in weight and a few ounces last 
for a long time. Two or three of them soaked in water 5-6 hours, 
chopped, and used with the water in which they soaked, give a 
marvelous flavor, surpassing fresh mushrooms, to a stuffing or 
gravy.^ 

Cod^s Liver, Parboil liver and cut into very small pieces. Mix

with 6-12 chopped steamed clams or mussels (see recipes), or

SMELTS 

There is nothing better in the low priced fish markets than these 
tiny, fat, silvery fish, related to the regal salmon and having the 
same firm meaty flesh and high flavor. Like the salmon they ascend 
into fresh water to spawn, and of late years our inland lakes and 
rivers have become permanently stocked with them. Only their 
size keeps them from the popularity they deserve, and the fact 
that people insist on mixing them up with their bones on the plate 
instead of carefully stripping off* their fillets with knife and fork. 

Prepare them by washing and scraping gently. Empty by making 
a cut just behind the head, then draw, pulling off" the head and 
bringing out the insides with the same motion. The smallest size 
should be strung half a dozen together on wooden skewers or small 
sticks, for no metal except silver should ever touch fish during the 
cooking process. Then they should be lightly seasoned and barely 
dusted with flour, and plunged into deep fat, drained on paper and 
piled on a paper-napkin-covered hot platter. Tartar sauce, or

mussel liquor into a pan, season, add onion, garlic, carrot, herbs 
and the fish; cover and simmer 8-10 minutes. Take up fish and 
keep hot. Heat and stir butter and flour together for 2 minutes 
over low heat, not allowing them to color. Stir in the cooking liquor 
and cook until it thickens, stirring constantly; add lemon juice, 
egg yolk, stir, and add mussels. Heat, but do not let it reach the 
boiling point or egg will curdle. Arrange mussels and sauce around 
fish, spooning some of the sauce over the top. This recipe also 
serves for any lean sea fish, cod, haddock, hake, pollack, croakers, 
etc.

Any sort of boiled fish may be used after skin and bones have been 
removed. Butter a pudding dish, put in a layer of fish, a layer of

ROLL-MOPS 

Let salt herring sweeten in milk overnight. Cut off the heads, split 
them through the back, remove the bones. Chop some onions very 
fine with a pinch of cloves and a pinch of mustard. Place a spoonful 
of this mixture on the inner side of each half-herring and roll them 
around half a dill pickle, fastening them with a toothpick used as a 
skewer. Place them all in a dish and prepare a liquid of one part 
water to three of vinegar. Boil and pour over the roll-mops. Add a 
spoonful of oil and cover up. Let stand three days. 

Like many words used by fishing folk, the name for this herring 
pickle has an amusing derivation. "Roll-mops" is only a shortened 
form of "roll-'em-ups.**

there's no waste. Tuna, swordfish, salmon and muskellunge, for 
instance, when they're in season, are much better buys than the 
cheapest of meats, and it's easy to fry or bake such toothsome 
steaks, never forgetting to spice them well with herbs. 

TUNA 

A welcome change from canned salmon is canned tuna fish. It 
costs more, but there is a small saving which brings the price down 
a little. For every good brand of tuna floats in a fine, flavorsome 
oil which serves in place of butter to spread the bread accompany- 
ing a tuna salad or sandwich, so if you spread it thin enough you 
may make up most of the added cost by the butter saving. But even 
if you don't, a change of diet has the variety value which keeps the 
stomach tuned to its work and saves doctor bills. And tuna offers 
a variety in itself, since the dark meat and white meat are canned 
separately, exactly as with chicken, which it resembles in taste if 
not in price. Italians, who drag it up out of the Mediterranean by 
the ton and buy it in fresh slices like beefsteak, call it "sea veal." 
And since fresh tuna is getting more common here, we can take

a tip from them in eating fresh tomatoes with it, the tomatoes

sequence — basil on tomatoes and tomatoes on "tunny," as the 
English call it.

Then serve, with several small squares of bread fried in butter or

Season It! 



We depend so much on salt and pepper for seasoning that we're 
likely to overlook a whole bouquet of fine flavors that make dishes 
twice as tasty at almost no cost at all. In Jewish sections you'll 
find plenty of highly-flavored seeds such as poppy and dill, spices 
and herbs — dill especially; in German districts there's always 
caraway; and few Italians, even when crowded into slums, can get 
along without a pot of basil growing on the window sill to make all 
dishes, especially those made with tomato, extra snappy. 

Herbs are easy to grow in a sunny window, or you can buy them 
fresh in summer and dried in winter at herb stores, foreign florist 
shops and sometimes on the pushcarts. Here is a list of common 
ones, all of them dirt cheap compared to the flavorsome work they 
do: anise, basil, caraway, celery, chives, coriander, dill, sweet 
marjoram, mint, parsley, sage, savory, tarragon, thyme and water- 
cress. Some of these can be bought in pots, especially in the "Little 
Italys," and these can be set in saucers on the kitchen window sill

54 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

for handy picking, watered daily and turned occasionally to keep 
them from growing lopsided. With plenty of sun and water they 
can be kept flourishing all winter, when green things are greatly 
relished. 

Most herbs belong to two plant families, the carrot and the 
mint. In America the large mint family supplies such favorite 
herbs as spearmint, peppermint, sage and thyme. We know ordi- 
nary garden mint best in mint juleps, and in mint sauce which goes 
so well with Spring lamb that many butchers give a bundle of it free 
with every leg. But the minced leaves should be strewn over green 
peas, string beans and new potatoes as well. They set off lemonade 
and nearly all tinkling summer drinks, and when the leaves are 
candied there is nothing better to garnish sweet potatoes, or to 
nibble after dinner in place of commercial mints. They should be 
dried, too, for winter use. Try powdering a few dried leaves into a 
steaming cauldron of pea soup. 

All members of the mint family serve in place of spearmint, which 
is the herb we call just "mint." In France, for instance, thyme is 
substituted, especially in the lowlands and salt marsh country 
where it grows wild and the sheep eat their weight in it. Hence 
French lamb is delicately reminiscent of its pasturage, and thyme 
is added to flavor the roast that's most highly prized in this section. 

On the other hand, sage, a sister mint, grows wild in the highlands 
and along the Mediterranean shore, just as it does in Texas — so 
sage-scented lamb takes the place of thyme-flavored there. 

From these two examples we see that it's safe to take our mints 
as we find them, and to remember, too, that the Greek honey of 
Mount Hymattus, famous for thousands of years and still imported 
to our shores by fancy grocers, got its reputation from the bees 
feeding on thyme flowers, just as the celebrated honey of Dalmatia 
owes its reputation to sage flowers. But we can get domestic mint- 
fed honey for the same price as ordinary clover honey, and it's tops! 

The carrot and mint families come together in the classic herb 
bouquet called bouquet garni in France and "a faggot of herbs" in 
England. This consists of either parsley or chervil, to represent 
the carrot family, tied in a tiny nosegay with just one leaf of bay 
and a sprig of some mint, such as thyme, sage, savory or spear- 



SEASON it! 55 



mint. Let it be marjoram or savory for consommes, stuffings and 
stews, and basil for turtle soup and ragouts. 

Green herbs make the best cooking bouquets and chives or tar- 
ragon pinch-hit for either parsley or thyme; and it's well to remem- 
ber, when using dried herbs, that a little goes a long way. 

Another indispensable combination is fines herbes, which origi- 
nally consisted of minced parsley and finely chopped chives. But in 
trailing French chefs around the world it's undergone many a sea 
change, so today the green specks that peek out at you from an 
omelette aux fines herbes, or other dish with as Frenchy a name, may 
be cress, basil, rosemary, thyme, savory — almost any of the herbs 
that belong to the sweet carrot or parsley family. Chervil is extra 
good m fines herbes because it tastes of parsley and fennel combined. 
So is minced cress, watercress or peppergrass. 

Fines herbes^ destined to be mixed with melted butter to make a 
sauce for grilled steak, needs tarragon along with the chives, and 
sometimes mushrooms. Indeed, there's no hard-and-fast rule about 
any of this; so just be guided by good horse taste and whatever 
seasoning there is at hand. 

We'd like to do culinary justice to some of the pot-herbs — 
purslane, for instance, more intimately known as pigweed, which 
the French get piggish about when a double handful is tossed into 
a chicken broth enriched with egg yolk, butter and cream, together 
with an equal amount of sorrel, the sour grass that all Frenchmen 
go for, both cooked and raw. You can bring back plenty of both 
for nothing from a trip to the country. 

Then there's good old burdock, a humble weed if ever there was 
one, yet it offers very fine fleshy food stalks free for folks to peel 
and cook like asparagus, or cut up raw into salad, which is a far 
better use for this burr-breeder than just to let it grow up into burrs 
that get into your socks and hair. Even the stinging nettle is an 
herb which cooks into a swell mess of greens. Corn salad, too, and 
its tiny twin brother peppergrass are other old-timers, but they're 
staging a come-back; they're listed now in almost any seed catalog, 
together with eloquent recommendations for their use in soups, 
salads and such, and shouldn't be hard to find in any big market. 

Chickweed, as well, is just as good food for man as for his canary.

When boiled it resembles spinach and is even tastier. Mix with 
dapper young dandelion leaves, pull them to pieces, dash with salt, 
pepper and lemon juice and lay them in a bed of butter on bread, 
to make the tastiest Spring Tonic Sandwich. 

Among the countless edible herbs we're inclined to pass up and 
call "weeds,'* there's poke, stinging nettle and Jack-by-the-hedge, 
so many of these roadside gypsies they'd fill a whole cookbook. So 
unless you know them by sight, let's let them go, with just the 
passing hint that Jack-by-the-hedge, whose alias is Sauce-alone, 
is flavored like garlic, but more subtly, and pokeweed is still keeping 
the share croppers alive down south. If you like, you can assuage 
Spring fever of almost any dangerous degree by putting all of the 
above into one combination salad, except the stinging nettle, 
which has to be cooked before it loses it's prickly heat. And for 
good measure, you might throw in a few sour dock leaves, plain 
plantain, the tip-ends of milk weed, a bit of wild onion, some 
nasturtium leaves and flowers minced together, oxtongue, lamb's 
quarters, shepherd's purse — in fact any of the luscious leaves, 
gummy pods and esculent roots you can gather by the basket full in 
almost any vacant lot in the suburbs. When we lived just outside 
of Chicago, Italians used to come out with gunny sacks to fill with 
such "weeds" we hundred-percenters let go to waste. And they 
carried back wild mushrooms and puflF balls, too, to make into stews 
and dry for a whole winter's soup supply. 

Better still, so you won't mix in some skunk cabbage by mistake, 
if you have access to a bit of land, select your favorite herbs from 
seeds supplied in great variety by the garden houses, plant them in 
any corner of good earth and watch them thrive like the weeds they 
are. Of course if you live in the city, the cops might object to your 
trying to raise savory, dill, fennel and whatnot at the foot of some 
Washington monument in the town park, so its safer to fetch home 
a sack of black loam and start an edible window box in any sunny 
room. The Department of Agriculture sponsors this practice and 
recommends the following spicy little plants to be potted — mint, 
cress, marjoram, basil, chives and rose geranium. Then when your 
herbary gets going, you'll always \i?iVQ fines herbes on hand to make 
any plain omelet fancy. If you think earthen pots look ugly, sub- 



SEASON it! 57 



stitute deep glass bowls — even a small terrarium or an old gold- 
fish bowl holds enough earth and gives just the right hot-house 
protection to supply plenty of basil and chives for a small family. 
Another very common herb that's been brightening dishes for 
centuries, at absolutely no cost at all, is the marigold. We think of 
it chiefly as a decorative flower, yet it's one of the fullest-flavored of 
culinary herbs. The petals alone are used in making the celebrated: 

MARIGOLD SOUP 

Boil mutton bones four or five hours, cool and remove fat, add an 
onion with a couple of cloves stuck in, a turnip and two potatoes, 
peeled and sliced, and boil everything until vegetables are soft. 
Then remove the onion and turnip and stir in two cups of cold 
boiled rice. At the finish sprinkle the top of the pot with a palmful 
of marigold petals, which not only give zest to this soup but dart 
away from the diner's spoon like glinting goldfish and add to the 
gaiety of eating. 




VI. Snacks 



That socialite trio, caviar, anchovies and olives, gain admittance 
to Park Avenue penthouse parties by the high prices of their pretty- 
glass containers. The fact that the rich will pay up to fifteen dollars 
a pound for the fanciest of caviar does not keep New York's East 
Side from enjoying just as much festivity on the toothsome red 
variety which comes out of an open can for thirty cents a pound. 
The very same anchovies that keep company with orchids and 
diamonds find their way to every Italian worker's table, but they 
are bought by weight out of barrels and twenty-pound tins, at a rea- 
sonable cost. These three gourmet treats can be enjoyed by all who 
will take the trouble to shop for them in the groceries, delicatessen 
and fancy food shops which abound in modest foreign neighbor- 
hoods. 

Quite a large variety of olives come in bulk. The ripe ones, 
wrinkly or smooth, and nearly black, particularly those sold in 
Greek stores, so rich and luscious to sink the teeth into, will make 
a salad sing if a few of them are stoned, roughly cut up and thrown 
in before the dressing. There are the very cheap little hard green 
ones which the grocer fishes for with a strainer in their salty pickle; 
every-day olives we'll call them, but tasty to nibble off their pits. 
This same variety costs three or four times as much when stufl^ed 
with pimiento and put up in bottles. Cut from their seeds and 
chopped, they make any stuffing or gravy fancy, especially for 
duck and chicken. With a little practice they may be pared off in 
spirals without waste; very pretty little nicknacks to put into salad 
or sauce, or to make a big show in garnishing. Each of these spirals 
can be stuffed, too, with a bit of red or green pepper, with a sliver

of pickle, a dot of egg white, a quarter of an anchovy, a nut meat 
with capers, or with grated cheese. 

Ripe olives are not so strongly flavored when pickled as when 
dried in their own oil. Ripe or green olives make an interesting 
appetizer for an occasional fine meal if cooked as follows:

Queen-size green olives are cheap, too, by the pound, and are 
really worth dressing up. The trick of stoning them while keeping 
them whole can be learned with a little patience. But they are even 
more interesting if slashed instead of stuffed, and laid in a pickle 
of your own for a night and a day — weakened vinegar with spices 
and herbs, peppercorns, fennel and aniseed being the favorite. 
Slivers of garlic or onion may be laid in the slashes. 

Thus a variety of half a dozen kinds of olives can be devised for 
a party at no more than the expense of one meager bottle. 

Pushcart markets in big cities have recently begun to sell Cali- 
fornia olives just as they are picked from the trees, of excellent 



6o MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

quality, large and fat; and since they are purchased mostly by 
Italian, French and Spanish housewives who pickle them at home 
with the double purpose of serving a tasty product at a low cost, 
they have remained cheap. Here is the way we pickled olives in 
our kitchen in Southern France: 

PICKLED GREEN OLIVES 

Discard all imperfect fruits and those that have begun to turn 
brown. Make a strong lye solution. We used ashes of olive wood, 
but commercial lye will do, in the proportion of X pound of lye to 
1/4 gallons of water. Place olives in an earthen jar, pour solution 
over and stir with a wooden spoon. The first day stir 4-5 times 
until all the fruit falls to the bottom of the jar. In a couple of days 
force a sharp nail into one of the olives to see if the fruit can be 
separated from the stone, then open it and observe whether the 
caustic has penetrated all the way through the fruity outside. 
This depends on the strength of the lye, which is not always of 
uniform quality. If not ready, dissolve a couple of tablespoons of 
lye in water and add to the solution, stirring thoroughly with the 
wooden spoon, so that the fresh lye will reach the bottom layer of 
fruit. Leave for a day and test again. Take olives out of the solution 
with a skimmer, wash in fresh water until no vestige of lye remains, 
then let them soak in fresh water for 8 days or so, changing it daily. 
By this time the olives should have lost their bitterness — test 
this by tasting. Then make the following pickling solution: 

5 QUARTS COLD WATER 3 FENNEL TOPS 

I POUND KITCHEN SALT PIECE OF ORANGE PEEL 

8-IO BAY LEAVES >^ TEASPOON CORIANDER SEEDS 

Boil all together for 5 minutes, and let cool. When completely 
cold pour over the drained olives and let stand in the crock for 
^-6 days, when they will be ready to eat. They may be packed in 
glass jars, filled to overflowing with the brine. Then rubbers and 
tops may be put on and they will keep like any pickles. The fennel 
tops, which resemble dill tops, usually may be purchased from the 
same vendor who sells the olives. A tablespoon of fennel seeds 
might be substituted, but will not give quite the same flavor. The 



SNACKS 6l 



outer husk of coriander seeds must always be removed and only 
the inner grain used. 

There are two kinds of anchovies, the real ones which have 
reddish brown flesh, and other little fish, often called sardellen, 
which are nearly as good, but do not have the anchovy color. The 
big tins of them in Italian groceries are usually the true anchovies, 
beheaded, emptied and put down in salt. They must be soaked 2-3 
hours in fresh water, changing it several times. Then the silver 
skin can be scraped a little, and the two fillets can be easily sepa- 
rated down the back with the ends of the two thumbs. They should 
come off the backbones neat and clean and be laid around the 
edge of a plate or platter to dry, when they are ready for any 
number of luxury dishes. They may be laid on fingers of toast 
their own size for canapes. They may be curled around any other 
tidbit, a bit of pickle, a caper, or what not; may be used to stuflF 
olives, or hard-cooked eggs, or to garnish or go into a salad. Or for 
future use they may be put into a jar with some olive oil until they 
absorb it. But after being deprived of their salt they will only 
keep a day or two, unless they are completely immersed in oil and 
hermetically sealed. 

Several clever cooking tricks evolve around these gustful little 
fish. The Scandinavians add a savory touch to breaded veal cutlets 
by laying a hatchwork of anchovy fillets across each one. Vapid 
fish like the cod family are greatly improved if the flesh is gashed 
in three or four places and an anchovy fillet is laid in each cut. Or 
a couple of fillets may be thrown into the roasting pan, not only 
for baking fish but for lamb and beef as well, to enhance both meat 
and gravy. The gravy should be sieved. 

Anchovies are also an important ingredient in a number of ex- 
pensive commercial sauces, which are very convenient to have on 
hand and are not difficult to make at home.

Open-faced red caviar sandwiches or canapes, Soviet style, are 
just the thing to sell at a money-raising organizational party, for 
they cost but a cent apiece and keep everybody happy and coming 
back for more, not minding a bit that the appetizing saltiness 
creates a thirst that keeps the bartender busy. Buy whole loaves 
of Russian black bread and cut it as thin as you can, for thus it 
goes best with caviar. Be careful not to break the orange-colored 
salmon eggs, but preserve them intact by using a little wooden 
spoon or paddle to transfer them from package and strew them 
over the bread. Open sandwiches covered with minced hard-cooked 
egg white and minced onion, with a sprinkling of the egg yolk 
pressed over through a sieve, will disappear too, but only because 
the taste of these combines so well with the caviar. j

VII. Savory Spreads 




Butter is such a universal spread we seldom think of changing to 
cream cheese, smearkase, mayonnaise and other equally good 
lubricators for bread. But in Europe butter is only one of the 
spreads and plain juicy black or rye bread is just as often covered 
with chicken fat, olive oil, even plain mustard, to make an appetiz- 
ing snack with beer and other drinks. Such things as catsup, chili 
sauce, pickled horseradish and garlic roasted soft make a slice of 
honest, well-knit bread, white or black, into a miniature meal. In 
fact, this last is the standard lunch of Italian shepherds. They carry 
along half a loaf of bread and dozens of whole heads of garlic which 
are roasted in the embers of olive twig fires until they become soft 
as butter and are then spread on the bread. Since cooking takes 
the strong taste and high spirit out of all onions, this is much milder 
than garlic sliced raw on bread moistened with olive oil. 

But we use olive oil mostly in the form of mayonnaise, and it's a 
pleasant change to spread bread with that, especially if a little 
relish, such as chopped chives or piccalilli is mixed into the mayon- 
naise. Or try beating the yolk of a hard-cooked egg into it, with a 
little salt and a couple of drops of Tabasco. 

Such relishes go as well and tend to go farther when mixed with 
butter, and when creamed with ordinary cottage or Dutch cheese, 

63 



64 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

which is good food and also cheap all over the world, youVe got 
something. 

Here are some suggestions for savory spreads to take the curse 
off common salty store butter: 

In summer mince fresh petals of roses, nasturtiums, violets, 
orange blossoms, apple, peach — in fact any fruity blossoms and 
perfumy flowers such as honey-filled clover heads, and mix them 
with ordinary butter, or with cottage or cream cheese and mayon- 
naise. This is a common practice in Europe, where spreads are 
never monotonous. 

GIBLET SPREADS 

Pound cooked livers, hearts, gizzards, the little eggs found inside 
a fat hen, or any combination thereof to make a paste with butter, 
cream cheese or mayonnaise for toast or crackers. 

CELERY 

Instead of throwing away fresh celery leaves pound them to a 
paste, pep them up with a little vinegar or lemon juice and salt, 
mix into an equal amount of butter, cheese or mayonnaise. 

AVOCADO BUTTER 

When avocados are both ripe and cheap, scoop the luscious 
vegetable butter out of the shell and mash it to a paste, seasoning 
with a little lemon juice and salt. This is a most refreshing spread 
as is, or it can be mixed with equal parts of regular butter. 

NUT SPREADS 

Pound nuts to oily paste, season with salt and cayenne and mix 
into 3-4 times as much softened butter, cheese, or mayonnaise. 

SHRIMP BUTTER 

4-5 DRIED SHRIMP ^i POUND SWEET BUTTER 

Pound dried shrimp to powder and cream into butter, then rub 
it through a fine sieve. 

Dried shrimp can be bought reasonably in any Chinatown. They 
are already shelled, so it isn't much trouble to pound them to 



SAVORY SPREADS 65 



powder and use like curry in seasoning anything which lends itself 
to their high, sharp flavor. 

Try your hand at making original spreads. If you like coffee, 
stir the contents of a George Washington "Ace" into as much 
butter as it will take and spread it on crackers for an unusual treat 
when you can*t have a cup of hot coffee, but hanker for the taste. 
Fresh fruits, especially apples, mix in to refreshing spreads and also 
double the volume of butter and cheese, making it go twice as far. 
Beef extract and fish pastes are likewise excellent, although they 
add to the cost of the original spread instead of reducing it, as 
bulkier ingredients do.

With a dull knife scrape liver to pulp, discarding veins and stringy

pepper, and form into cakes ^ inch thick. Fry in hot fat. The 
patties are done as soon as the reddish. color has changed to brown 
all the way through, and care should be taken to never overcook 
liver, for it quickly becomes leathery and flavorless, and indigesti- 
ble as well. 

Prepare the sliced onions separately by putting them into rapidly 
boiling water and cooking for 5 minutes. Drain them, but save 
some of the water in which they're cooked. 

When you take up the liver patties put the cooked onions into 
the frying pan gravy, add a spoonful of the onion water and stir 
lightly for a moment until onions have absorbed the liver flavor. 

Put patties in center of hot platter, surround with onion slices, 
which fall into decorative rings, and serve with dish gravy made 
by stirring some more of the onion water into the contents of the 
frying pan. 

Because beef liver is toughest and driest of the livers, it should 
be cheaper than either lamb or pig. And to overcome the toughness 
it must be scraped to a pulp, which also helps bring out its fullest 
flavor. Calves' liver, which probably is tastiest of the lot, costs 
three times as much as beef, so its use is prohibitive. In fact, 
chicken, turkey, and even goose livers are a better buy than calves*

Dried beef is called "jerky" by Texas cowboys; it's their

This is the original Western Sandwich which, with the present

Cut oranges and lemons in half, remove most of the yellow

tween meat in pan.

Most Kosher and Latin butchers carry calves' cheeks and also 
calves' feet, which are almost unknown in regular ioo% American 
butcher shops. So the cheeks are still as good a buy as calves* 
liver was before the medicos boosted the price to prohibitive 
heights. 

To keep this dish cheap, any tasty fat may be used in place of 
butter, and wine vinegar instead of oranges and lemons. But if you 
can afford it, use the butter and fruit, for the extra quality im- 
parted by these is well worth the difference. 

Of course, any left-over cold cheek meat makes swell sandwiches, 
with a bit of pickle or chili sauce for piquance.

Return the fried bacon to the pan and cook everything together, 
shaking the pan and stirring until meat is lightly browned. Press 
tinned or cooked tomatoes through a sieve to make i cup of pulp. 
Add this pulp and the boiling water. Cover well and simmer 45

This is a juicy stew, excellent for dunking. 

The French standby for a cheap meat dish is a whole or half 
calf s head with the brains taken out, but the cheeks not cut off. 
This requires long, slow cooking, which costs money when you're 
buying from a gas or electric company. So the cheeks alone, with- 
out any bone or waste, make a dish that's quicker to cook and as 
tender as spring chicken, which it resembles in taste. 

Because calves' cheeks are almost unknown outside of foreign 
butcher shops they sell for about 25 f^ a pound and are even a better 
buy than beef, pig's or lamb's liver. Since they're all meat, this is a 
very economical food and one that meets with universal approval. 

If there is any objection to garlic it may be cut in slices and 
picked out just before serving; then its presence will not be sus- 
pected, and the dish will be subtly improved by its flavor. For it's 
well known among canny cooks that people who think they can't 
stand the taste of garlic relish its flavor if they happen to eat a 
garlic-seasoned roast or stew with their eyes shut. And, by the 
way, in handling cut garlic all odor can instantly be washed off 
the fingers by holding them for a moment under the cold water tap. 

BUBBLE AND SQUEAK 

Lightly fry in butter any cold meat cut in thin slices and keep 
it warm while you heat up any cold cooked vegetables such as 
cabbage, potatoes, onions and turnip-tops chopped together and 
seasoned with Mike and Ike, the salt and pepper shaker twins. 
When vegetables are ready put meat on a hot platter, surround it 
with the vegetables and sluice with gravy, if there is any. 

This standby of England started in the good old days when most 

poor families had a joint of beef every Sunday, with some always 

left over until the middle of the week. It's a quick way of using 

[. leftovers and is about the same as our hash, except the meat isn't

chopped and it*s cooked separately. The picturesque name comes 
from the bubbling of the margarine and the squeaking of the cab- 
bage whilst cooking, for cabbage is always a prime ingredient. The 
dish is also aifectionately known as Bubblum Squeak.

Pour over meat and bake i hour. 

Down South a mugwump is a tadpole when he has grown half 
way into a frog, but is neither one nor the other. Before the Dem- 
ocratic and Republican parties became exactly alike, a voter who 
was loyal to neither but switched when he pleased was derisively 
called a mugwump, or in-between tadpole, by his confreres in both 
parties. The epithet carries no sting now, when one of our United 
States senators can run on both tickets at the same time for nom- 
ination as Mayor of New York City. There were never any asper- 
sions on this dish, however, which is a variation of the British 
"Toad in a Hole," and by any name it*s both economical and good. 
The baking dish may be carried to the table just as it comes out of 
the oven, or the mugwumps may be taken out of their holes and 
laid on a hot platter, with the holes set around them as a garnish.

Have butcher clean feet well; wash them; put in cold water; blanch

Work 2 tablespoons flour smooth with a little water, stir into the 
hot water and pour over the feet. Add onion stuck with cloves, 
carrots, herb bouquet consisting of sprig of thyme, parsley, celery 
and bayleaf; add vinegar and pepper. Salt is added during cooking. 
Partially cover kettle and simmer 5-6 hours. The sheeps* feet are 
done when the middle bones may be detached easily. Melt butter 
in another kettle, lightly brown the chopped onion, add 2 table- 
spoons flour, stir together, then add nearly all of the cooking liquor, 
stirring all smooth. Beat egg yolks with milk, add, stirring con- 
stantly, and take from the fire before egg can curdle. Lift feet one 
at a time from the kettle, remove and discard center bones; drop 
feet into sauce, sprinkling in the lemon juice. Serve at once in a 
deep hot dish. 

The test of a good cook is the ability to take food materials that 
less competent cooks reject in favor of prime parts easier to do and 
make them into succulent dishes by skilful, intelligent preparation. 
This practice has brought distinction to both thrifty French cooks 
and poverty stricken Negroes, who have had to take the tougher, 
rejected meats and make them into dishes fully as delicious as 
those of a ritzy chef who has everything at hand. 

STEWED LAMB'S TAILS 

Trim the tails; line a stewpan with slices of bacon, carrots, and 
onions. Put in the tails, with one clove of garlic and an herb bou- 
quet — that is, a sprig of thyme, two sprigs of parsley and a bay 
leaf, tied together. Season with a clove and peppercorns; put the 
stewpan over the fire for 10 minutes, then pour in i pint of boiling 
water and 2 pints of vinegar. Simmer until done, salting while 
cooking. Take the tails out, strain the liquor they have cooked in 
and boil it until almost reduced to a glaze. Then put the tails back 
in and warm them up again. Prepare a puree of spinach or a mess 
of greens such as beets, turnip or poke, pile it in the center of a hot 
dish, arrange the tails around it, and pour their sauce over all. 

These are a real delicacy, as are the tails of all animals, from pigs 
to oxen. The bit of tail our canny packing houses leave on a leg of 



72 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

lamb is a delicious morsel if it is well protected by a thick covering 
of paper to keep it from drying out while the rest of the leg is roast- 
ing. And those who have dined on the broad fat tails of Turkish 
sheep, so prized that centuries of careful breeding have been de- 
voted to producing them, always come back for more. 

HAVE A HEART! 

Pig*s and lamb's hearts are good just cut up and stewed with 
vegetables and herb seasonings. There should be a browned flour 
gravy. Or they may be stuffed as follows: 

For each heart: i small onion, minced, i tablespoons bread 
crumbs, i tablespoon melted fat, j^ teaspoon sage, salt, pepper, and 
a dash of cayenne. StuflF, sew up opening and brown heart in fat; 
then stew in very little water with a carrot and an onion. When 
tender eat at once. 

Although beef, lamb and pigs* hearts are both good and cheap, 
the one that appeals most to us is veal heart. In New York City we 
pay a nickel apiece for these, and since they weigh around half a 
pound, that's probably the cheapest solid meat available anywhere. 
To make the dish economical it's advisable to cook more than enough 
for one meal, since the cooked meat keeps well and is fine when cold. 

Let the veal hearts lie in cold water to discharge coagulated 
blood, wash thoroughly, open up pockets with a knife, trim veins, 
fill with rich stujffing flavored with onion juice and poultry season- 
ing, or your own herb mixture, and have that stuffing moist. Sew 
up, and slowly bake or braise with onion, carrot, herbs, and pepper- 
corns. If some of them are to be eaten cold, the family will welcome 
the change if these are stuffed somewhat differently: a little ground 
liver, or sausagemeat, or leftover poultry, mixed with the crumbs, 
with slightly different seasoning — and then let the ones so stuffed 
cool in the gravy, wipe dry, and slice thin. The circular slices with the 
inner rounds of stuffing are attractive to look at and very palatable. 

BEEF HEART 

The heart of every animal is both substantial and tasty, as any- 
body knows who has fished the chicken heart out of a stew and 
gobbled it as an appetizer while the cook was making the dumplings. 



SWELL PICKINGS 73 



Heart is as good meat in its way as kidneys or high-priced liver, 
and the best thing about buying hearts is that there's almost no 
waste. But being the most active of all muscles, the old and big 
ones, such as beef, are both lean and dry, so the fat they lack must 
be supplied in stuffing or in basting sauce, and the dry tough 
texture must be overcome by long, slow cooking and much basting. 
Beef heart is especially obdurate, but it is a fine dish, if the cook 
starts out with some of the courage its consumption was anciently 
supposed to supply. It tastes something like game and is entirely 
worthy of being eaten with currant or grape jelly. Three hours 
should be allowed for braising, or two for roasting. A fireless cooker 
does this dish at little cost. First soak the heart in cold water for 
half an hour, then parboil it; strain and save the liquid to use in 
basting. Enlarge the natural openings or pockets with a knife, and 
stuff with breadcrumbs which have been wet and squeezed dry, 
mixed with minced suet or bacon, and seasoned with thyme, grated 
nutmeg or an infinitesimal amount of powdered cloves, and a tea- 
spoon of grated lemon rind (the yellow outside only). Sew up, and 
place in the pan with a sliced onion, a bit of carrot, a bay leajf and 
celery leaves. Reduce the parboiling liquor, add to it 2 tablespoons 
bacon fat or other fat, and either the juice of a lemon or 2 table- 
spoons of vinegar to help tender it, and baste with the mixture 
every 15 minutes. Keep closely covered until done. There should 
be plenty of good rich gravy. Carve like a honeydew melon, from 
top to tip and all the way to the center of the stuffing, so each 
portion looks like the new moon with stuffing filling its convexity.

macaroni for each chop; seasonings, a bit of thyme, sage or savory, 
and perhaps a small garlic clove, minced. Simmer for an hour, 
closely covered. A bit of any suitable left-over vegetable may be 
added at the end, a tablespoon or so of peas, cooked celery, carrot, 
tomato, or what have you. There should be a little liquid gravy if 
the cooking is slow enough. Otherwise boiling water must be added 
while cooking, and then the flavor and texture will not be so good.

This recipe, supposedly invented to be served at StroganofF

cubes, and it may be beef, veal, chicken or goose, or any mixture 
of them. The flour used for thickening is buckwheat, so common 
in this section, and it is lightly browned in the oven before being 
added. The seasoning varies with the fresh herbs in the market, and 
even includes tomatoes, which may take the place of the sour cream 
in summer.

In an Italian-American bill-of-fare an oddity will be noted in 
Bistecchine di Agnello^ literally "a beefsteak of lamb." 

A similar "howler" exists in the Rosbif de Mouton of Flanders. 
Quite naturally there can be neither beefsteak of lamb nor roast 
beef of mutton, yet these names for these dishes point out the uni- 
versality of the distinctive Anglo-American pieces de resistance. 

But nowadays steak is too expensive for most of us, so we often 
taken our protein in the form of: 

Eggs. Some like 'em white, some like 'em brown, but all of us 
like 'em fresh. In New York City eggs selected for their pearly 
whiteness fetch a few cents more a dozen, while mid- West cus- 
tomers fancy the brown egg as fuller flavored and are sometimes 
willing to pay a cent or two more for their preference. It's all a 
matter of taste, just so long as the eggs are fresh and of good size. 
The only honest way to sell eggs is by weight, but dealers make 
more money grading them as to color and size. Back in a Chicago 
suburb forty years ago a woman on our street. Old Miss Prouty, 
used to go to the store and pick out the biggest eggs in person, 
which got to be a town joke because she was rich and everybody 
said she got that way by getting her money's worth — a thing 
considered hardly respectable by us poorer families, well-trained 
by both grocer and butcher to telephone in our orders and accept 
their word for quality and weight. No housewife would think of 
being seen with a market basket, and as a result, in a year or two 
the grocer in our town had bought up half the vacant lots around 
and the butcher got himself a nice string of race horses, not for 
slaughtering purposes. In ordering fish from him, for example, 
the housewife would pick up the receiver and say, "Otto, send 



8o MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

up four pounds of fish." Just fish. No thought as to whether he 
sent a cheap fish that cost him three cents a pound, or a really 
flavorsome one for which he had to pay six. And that helped him 
get rich, because we always paid fifteen. 

It was almost the same with meat, **Otto, how's your chicken 
today?" "All right, send her up if she's plump." Never any ques- 
tions of price, quality or weight, only unconsciously intimate little 
questions like '*Otto, how are your hams today?" Or, "your sir- 
loin?" It wasn't often that a bride asked, "Are your kidneys nice? 
How's your liver, lamb fries, or heart?" Such giblets were supposed 
to be bought, if at all, only for the cat. 

So Otto might have heaved his cleaver at a customer who asked, 
"Have you got any brains?" For brains, although good, cheap 
food out of which fine dishes can be made quickly and simply, 
were taboo. You might have whispered "calves' brains" to him, 
but if you asked for pigs' brains, which many people prefer for 
their substance and flavor, the story about your poverty-stricken 
taste would have been all over town by night. 

PIGS' BRAINS WITH BLACK BUTTER 

Boil a bone with some onion, thyme and half a bay leaf, or use a 
beef cube in place of the bone, and in this broth slowly poach the 
pigs' brains for 15-20 minutes, then remove membranes and sim- 
mer the brains golden in blackened butter pepped up with a couple 
tablespoons of vinegar, using this for a sauce at the finish and saving 
the delicate and delicious broth in which the brains were cooked 
to start your next soup. 

CALVES' BRAINS 

Prepare and serve same as pigs' brains, or vary the sauce from 
black butter to ravigote, the French "pick-me-up" mixture of 
minced tarragon, chervil, chives and burnet, made into a sauce 
with melted butter, salt, pepper, and a squeeze of lemon juice. 

SADDLE OF RABBIT

ter. Put into hot oven and when it begins to brown you begin to 
baste with yi cup of heated cream, either sweet or sour, or evapo- 
rated milk, and lower oven temperature to moderate. A young 
rabbit will be done in ^ hour. An older one may take as long as 
i^ hours and it's great cooked country style, that is, basted with 
buttermilk, which helps the tendering process. No other seasonings 
are necessary beyond more and more buttermilk as evaporation 
takes place. A bay leaf or % teaspoon crumbled sage dropped into 
the pan at the beginning enhances the gravy. 

In Brooklyn we paid 4f^ a quart for buttermilk from an inde- 
pendent dairy that had a hard time getting rid of all they produced, 
while the milk monopohsts held their price at loj:,. 

JUGGED RABBIT 

This is a dish which should only be prepared on a fire con- 
stantly kept going for heating purposes, because it takes so long 
to cook. In England we often had it cooked on the hob before our 
fireplace. And anybody who has a fireplace can do most of his 
cooking on it. You can call it jugged hare if you like, but we've 
no time for splitting hares, since everything is rabbit to the Ameri- 
can butcher. 

The following quantities of seasonings are flexible according to 
individual taste: 

1 ONIONS % TEASPOON POWDERED THYME 

6 CLOVES yi TEASPOON SAVORY OR MARJORAM 

I TEASPOON CHOPPED PARSLEY >^ TEASPOON GRATED NUTMEG

Stick 3 cloves into each onion, mix all the other seasonings to- 
gether. Salt and pepper pieces of rabbit and fry brown in butter. 
Line the bottom of an earthenware bean pot with bacon strips 
and pack down the fried rabbit, scattering the seasonings in as 
you proceed. Place one onion near the bottom and the other near 
the top. Add the juice of an orange, or other fruit juice mixed 
with I cup of wine or cider and i cup of meat broth. (The broth 
can be made of i beef cube.) Or add i cup of ale or beer and i cup 
of water. Seal the cover tight with flour and water paste. Set in 



82 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

a large kettle of cold water and after it boils cook 4 hours, more or 
less, depending on age of the rabbits. If you have even, slow heat, 
the kettle of water may be dispensed with. Or the pot may be set 
in a slow oven. Take up meat, keep hot, skim fat off the liquid, 
strain, and thicken with flour worked smooth with a little water and 
poured in through a sieve; boil 3-5 minutes. Put rabbit back in 
bean pot, pour gravy over and put it on the table. If the rabbit is 
fresh-killed save the blood to mix with the gravy. 

Small onions, boiled and then caramelled in butter with a tea- 
spoon of sugar, go with any dish of rabbit, or hare, as does a puree 
of boiled chestnuts.

Good 
Gravies 



I 



The best of all gravies is broiled steak juice that follows the 
knife and collects in the hot platter, mingled with the dribblings of 
butter which was spread on the sizzling meat when it was taken 
from the grill. Even though one can have a steak like that, there is 
never enough dish gravy to give each person more than a taste. 
So this great, natural gravy is something to think about wistfully, 
rather than to eat. 

Next best is the essence of meat that flows out of it during the 
process of cooking, and even this must be stretched to go around. 
By the time it is increased by thinning, and then is thickened with 
tasteless flour, it too often serves no other purpose than to wet 
the food it is spooned over. To make up for its deficiencies, store 
catsup, or some other expensive commercial condiment, is put on 
the table to pep things up, thus adding one more item to the budget 
which would not be necessary were the meat's natural dressing 
all it should be. 

The first requisite for a good gravy is a good gravy maker, one 
who is not too hurried and flurried at the moment of taking up a 
meal to give the crowning sauce all the care and quick thought it 
demands. The next requisite is a wooden spoon to stir it with, 
and a small collection of herbs and seasonings to give it inspiration. 

Such a gravy maker knows that the pan liquid should never be 
diluted with plain water. Vegetables are usually cooking in other 
vessels on the stove, and it is just as easy to take some of the tasty 
broth from boiling potatoes, or peas, or string beans, as to reach 
for the tea kettle. She will also save for this purpose the liquids in 
which foods were cooked for former meals. A cup of leftover soup 
will come in handy, too, and, of course, milk for veal and chicken. 
Anything to add flavor instead of weakening it.

84 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

There are three ways to thicken a gravy with flour: 
(i) Work the flour smooth in a little liquid, strain as an extra 
precaution against lumps, and pour into the simmering pot liquor 
slowly, stirring carefully all the while until thick and smooth. 
This procedure is suitable only for stews and fricassees which are 
already fully seasoned and which will be served in the gravy. The 
solid portions should be lifted out with a skimmer, kept hot, and 
returned to the pot for a few minutes for a final immersion in the 
simmering sauce before serving. 

(2) Knead equal quantities of flour and butter, or fat, together, 
and drop tiny bits of the mixture into the pot, here and there, 
shaking or otherwise agitating the liquid so the lumps dissolve 
evenly and mingle smoothly with the whole. This way is appropri- 
ate for a mixture of meat and vegetables which cannot be skimmed 
out easily before gravy-making begins, or for fish slices or other 
foods of such delicate texture that their appearance is spoiled by 
too much handling. 

In using either of these first two methods one should make ab- 
solutely sure there are no lumps, and that the consistency is right, 
neither too thick nor too thin. And then the solids and liquid should 
simmer together for at least 15 minutes in order to completely 
cook the starch, and to let it make a coating over each morsel. 

(3) In a separate sauce pan or frying pan, fat and flour are 
cooked together over heat so low that they may simmer for 15 
minutes without scorching. Gravies for roasts, pot-roasts, and 
ragouts, are best made in this manner, with some of the fat skimmed 
from pot or roasting pan. The general rule for quantities is i table- 
spoon of fat to I tablespoon of flour, and i cup of liquid. The 
thorough cooking of flour and fat together before the liquid is 
added prevents the pastiness that is characteristic of bad gravies. 
It is obvious that this part of the process should begin before 
the meat is quite done. The careless gravy maker errs right here, by 
starting so late that either the gravy is stickily underdone, or the 
meat is drying out in the oven while she is patiently stirring, sea- 
soning, and straining the gravy. Before this final cooking, the gravy 
should be tasted, and here is where the artistry comes in. While the 
tongue is holding the flavor, the cook stands before her seasoning 



GOOD GRAVIES 85 



shelf, so that inspiration may decide just what touch of this or 
that will make the composition perfect. For flavor is what one 
craves in a gravy, not too much, but just enough to enhance the 
food it accompanies. Our seasoning shelf for sauces contains such 
simple things as these: a glass jar of dried celery leaves, another 
of dried parsley, others containing thyme, marjoram, sage, etc.; 
a sifter of dried chili peppers, to be crumbled between the hands; 
a shaker of celery salt; a bottle of red chili peppers in vinegar; soy 
sauce from Chinatown — cheaper than Worcestershire; a jar of 
tomato paste bought in bulk at an Italian grocery, with a little oil 
always poured over the surface to keep it moist and fresh; paprika 
— the best Hungarian is cheap and wonderful, but buy it in bulk; 
whole peppers to be twisted in a corner of cloth and crushed to 
give real pepper flavor; beef and chicken cubes, of which the 
Herb-Ox brand is the best weVe found. It has appetizing green 
specks of tangy herbs in it. 

No milk gravy for meats should ever turn out white. It should 
be tawny with delicately browned flour, or pale pink with paprika. 
And it should have an appetizing flavor of its own, imparted by 
celery leaves, or parsley, or a little grated onion — whatever goes 
best with the meat. 

For dark gravies the French have a trick we have adopted. We 
very slowly fry a minced onion in about 2 tablespoons of the meat 
fat, cover the pan and let the onion merely smother until nearly 
done, sprinkle in the flour — about a tablespoonful — through 
a sieve; stir and fry for 5 minutes. The liquid goes in then, and 
stirring is vigorous until all are well mixed. It must simmer for 
10 minutes longer, be occasionally stirred, and finally finished by 
straining. French cooks sometimes fry a grated small carrot with 
the onion, and drop in a little chopped celery before simmering. 
The result is truly tasty.

Squeal 




With the high price of pork, ham and bacon, it's a good thing to 
know that every part of the pig is good eating, right down to the 
squeal. Spareribs, jowls, liver, kidney, yes, even the ears and tails, 
every one of them as good as "poke chops" in its way. 

In most foreign countries pigs' ears and tails are highly esteemed, 
but they've never been popular in America, except down South 
where white landowners threw them to their slaves, who, from ne- 
cessity, learned to make delicious dishes out of things their white 
masters considered offal. And this mistake exists down to this day 
when slaughter houses market everything but the chops and ten- 
derloin for almost anything they'll bring. But certain butchers 
specialize in such choice tidbits as hogs' jowls, chitterlings, and 
harslet, the pluck of the animal which includes heart, lungs and 
liver. Ten cents a pound is the price, just now, but let some smart 
promoter get to work on them and they'll go skyrocketing, for from 
this raw material at which the snooty turn up their noses, the tasti- 
est dishes are made. It's all a matter of education, as is easily seen 
in the fact that calf's liver and sweetbreads not so many years ago 
were given away or sold for next to nothing, until vitamin hunters 
brought calf's liver up to 8of^ a pound and doctors prescribed sweet- 
breads to a growing class of millionaire gourmets who thought it 
was good for their own giblets, brains, or something. 

So don't stop at anything edible, and here are some appetizing 
ways to use the unpopular parts of a pig.

RIGHT DOWN TO THE SQUEAL 87 

This recipe is played in halves, like a football game. 

Boil the jowls half an hour in salted water, then put the greens in 
and boil everything together for the second half. 

Salt and pepper at the finish, pep up the greens with vinegar or 
lemon juice and add a little butter if you like. 

This dish that came out of the poverty of the Negroes in slave 
days was quickly appropriated by the whites, so when you see a 
testimonial to Southern cooking today by some of the great native 
eaters like Irvin S. Cobb, you'll usually find them rooting for hogs' 
jowls and turnip greens or some other humble dish such as pigs* 
ears boiled with mustard greens, according to recipes worked out 
in plantation days when the master got the ham and tenderloin 
and the slave got the squeal. 

There are dozens of variations that may be rung on this simple 
recipe and all of them excellent. Here are some: 

Pig's Snoot and Collards 

Hog Maws, Southern Style 

Pig Tails and Poke Greens, Cabbage or Brussels Sprouts 

Salt Pork and Beet Greens 

Neck Bones and Virginia Collards 

Pigs' Feet and Alabama Mustard Greens 

Such specialties are easiest to find in the Negro sections of big 
cities, like New York's Harlem, which, in spite of its poverty, en- 
joys an exceptional cuisine that would make a Park Avenuer's 
taste buds come to full bloom if he ever got the chance to taste 
it: spareribs and turnip tops for example, every part of the pig with 
all kinds of greens, from poke salad to sorrel, which is plain sour 
grass to us but an exhilarating herb to all Frenchmen. 

In fact, about the only Negro dish that some folks can't go, is 
chitterlings, but when they're young and tender as "newmown 
spaghetti " they're tops, either plain or with turnip tops. Any chit- 
terling fan will walk a mile for them. 

Another great contribution of the slaves is crackling — and here's 
a tip for a perfect appetizer: render the pig fat next to the skin in 
juicy mouthfuls, and serve it sizzling, just plain crackling, with a 
touch of salt.

PIG'S LIVER 

Pig's liver is so luscious that many people who can afford the 
difference in price really prefer it to calf's liver which costs four 
times as much. To our mind it has beef liver beat a mile; although it 
is about as dry, it's much more tender. You might like to try pig's 
liver in place of beef in the Beef Liver Pattie recipe given under 
"Swell Pickings." 

But the most popular way of cooking the liver of any old hog is 
to fry it plain, using plenty of fat to overcome that natural dryness. 

Because this is a favorite in Negro Harlem the price is held high 
by whites who own most of the butcher shops, but elsewhere, es- 
pecially on the fringes of wealthy white sections, pig's liver is a drug 
on the market and sells even lower than that of beef or lamb. And 
of course we all relish it without knowing it, for the fine flavor of 
commercial liverwurst comes from just that, since pig's liver is used 
in this almost exclusively. But don't buy a pig's liver in a poke, for 
it's not handled as carefully as the more expensive livers. Punch it 
to make sure it's firm; see that it's bright red in color, and fresh, 
with very little odor. It deteriorates rapidly and when kept too 
long becomes soft and dark-colored around the edges. And in cook- 
ing, never wash it, but wipe it clean with a damp cloth before re- 
moving skin and veins. Tough liver should be parboiled 20 minutes 
if it's to be cooked whole, or 5 minutes if already sliced. 

PIGS' FEET 

Have bones of 6 feet split lengthwise by butcher, leaving each 
two halves attached; scrape, and soak in cold water 3-4 hours. 
Drain, cover with cold water, add a sliced carrot, a sliced onion, a 
dozen peppercorns, a sprig of celery, another of thyme and one bay 
leaf. Simmer and skim until very tender, adding salt while cooking. 

At this point they are prepared for cooking in any way you like, 
grilling, pickling, or jellying. If your family is large it will pay you 
to use 12 feet and double the recipe, and if small you might save out 
3 of the feet for jellying or pickling and grill the other 3, as follows: 

Drain, lay on a dish to cool somewhat, cut the skin holding the 
bones together, season each half-foot, rub with butter or oil, roll in 



RIGHT DOWN TO THE SQUEAL 89 

crumbs and fry or grill until brown on all sides. Meanwhile fry a 
minced onion brown and tender, add some of the boiling liquor, 
cook for a moment, add a tablespoon of vinegar, a small minced 
pickle and cayenne pepper. Serve with this sauce poured over, or 
in a boat for each diner to help himself. 

PICKLED PIGS' FEET 

6 pigs' feet, cooked 1 CUPS CIDER VINEGAR 

CAYENNE 6 CLOVES 

3 TEASPOONS SALT GRATED NUTMEG

Cook feet according to first half of recipe above. While still 
hot lay in a bowl, season with salt and cayenne. Heat vinegar to 
boiling point with spices and pour over feet, cover, and leave until 
next day, turning them over several times. 

A better way to pickle pigs* feet, however, is to begin with un- 
cooked feet, split in halves and soaked for several hours in cold 
water. To every 6 feet you add 3 cups of vinegar and bring to boiling 
point. Skim, add 2 medium onions, 1 bay leaves, 20 peppercorns 
and lyz teaspoons salt, boil slowly for i^ hours, or put in fireless 
cooker for longer time. 

Let them cool and serve cold in their own juicy jelly. 

Potato salad is the ideal accompaniment to this melodic snack, 
and beer, of course. 

The only reason for pickling pigs' feet yourself is to save money 
on a good-sized quantity, enough to pay for the beer maybe. If 
only 2 or 3 are wanted it's cheaper to buy them at a delicatessen. 

Peppercorns should be bought by the pound in bulk (and the 
same holds true for Hungarian paprika), since the packaged kinds 
are no better and cost many times as much by weight. But usually 
only foreign shops keep peppercorns (or paprika) in bulk. Ground 
pepper is largely a racket, in which all kinds of inferior peppers and 
adulterant bird seeds are concealed, so it's best to buy the whole 
round pepper berries and grind them yourself, or pound up in a 
cloth But in this recipe only the whole peppers give the proper 
flavor. The black kind give you the most pep for your money. 
Black pepper is fully ripened on the tree, while white pepper is 



90 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

picked green, hence milder in flavor, and chiefly used in salads, 
such as white potato salad in which black pepper specks are too 
conspicuous. So if you want to do the thing right, use black peppers 
in the pigs' feet and white peppers for the accompanying potato 
salad, but don't put any kind of pepper in the beer. 

PICKLED PIGS' FEET BROILED 

Split in half, egg and crumb them, and broil. Eat with lemon 
juice and cayenne, or with a piquant sauce. 

JELLIED PIGS' FEET 

Boil feet according to first half of first recipe. Take out bones and 
cut up meat; strain cooking liquor through cloth, season and spice 
to taste with cayenne, a few grains powdered cloves, a tablespoon 
of your favorite condiment, and juice of a lemon. Heat, to blend 
seasonings, and reduce by boiling if you think necessary; lay meat 
in a mold, pour liquor over, cool and chill. Unmold on platter and 
decorate with servings of potato salad laid on lettuce leaves, cut-up 
dill pickle, red radishes, and slices of pickled beets. 

JELLY OF PIGS' FEET AND EARS 

Cut up both feet and ears, simmer in water to barely cover, with 
I teaspoon sage, 3 sprigs parsley or of dried herbs, peppercorns, and 
yi teaspoon ground mace, salting while cooking. Take out bones of 
feet when done, arrange meat in a mold, strain liquid through very 
fine sieve, pour over meat, cool and chill. 

PIGS' EARS 

Cut in two, each half being as big as your hand and as white as 
snow. Grill in a slightly greased frying pan; they will be done in no 
time. Season and eat with spinach, sauerkraut or cabbage. They 
may be cooked like pigs' feet, too, or cooked with the feet, slicing 
the ears when done; and like pigs' feet they may then be either 
pickled or served hot with their gravy; or they may be allowed to 
cool, and then egged, crumbed and fried.

SMOTHERED PIGS' TAILS 

Slowly brown 1^4 pounds of tails in a little fat, with a chopped 
onion; season with pepper and }i teaspoon sage or thyme to each 
pound of tails. Add i cup boiling water, cover closely and simmer 
very slowly until tender, salting while cooking. 

PORK KIDNEY 

Split kidney, remove skin and core, cut in y^ inch slices, season 
and dredge with flour. Heat i tablespoons bacon fat, brown a 
minced onion in it and a clove of garlic if you wish, then brown the 
kidney slices. They will make their own gravy, which is better if 
yi cup of strained tomatoes is added. 

PORK CHOPS AND APPLES 

Trim some of the fat from 4 pork chops, season with salt and 
pepper, and lay in a baking dish. Cover with thin slices of greening 
apples; sprinkle with a very little sugar, just to make the apples 
brown, and dot with butter. Bake in a hot oven until apples begin 
to get tender, then pour in sufficient cider to make a gravy. Bake 
another half hour. 

FRIED PORK CHOPS WITH SAUERKRAUT 

6 chops seasoned with salt and pepper, dredged with flour and 
fried in hot fat. Parboil i pound sauerkraut. Remove chops from 
frying pan, put in kraut and fry until brown. Serve with chops and 
mashed potatoes. 

STUFFED PORK CHOPS 

Make a stuffing of minced ham or left-over meat, bread crumbs 
and onions, or use any preferred mixture. Pile some of the mixture 
in center of a thin pork chop, lay another on top, sandwich-wise, 
press together and fasten well with toothpicks. Fry in butter or 
bacon fat, or bake in gravy.

Soak beans over night, parboil and then cook until nearly tender. 
Or open i cans of pork and beans. Mix cut-up spareribs with sauer- 
kraut and peppercorns and simmer in own juices for }4. hour. Stir 
in the beans, with a little of their liquor, imbed the potatoes in the 
mixture, and simmer 40 minutes. Taste before potatoes are done 
and add salt carefully, the amount needed depending on how salty 
the kraut is. This dish is not worth making unless eight people are 
to be served. 

GRILLED SPARERIBS 

Do not cut them up. Rub with garlic, sprinkle well with pepper 
and lemon juice, and let stand half an hour. Put under medium grill 
and turn often, seasoning with salt while grilling. 

ROAST PORK REHEATED 

Fry a large onion in bacon fat or butter. Slice another and boil 
without covering. Mash both together through a sieve. Heat pork 
slices in bacon fat or butter, pour onions over and simmer a few 
minutes, seasoning with a little salt, and pepper to taste. 




XI. JVatch Your JVeight! 

We're so used to reading articles about reducing, instead of 
keeping healthily plump, that the phrase "watch your weight" 
makes us think we're going to be advised not to get fat. But we ad- 
vise our readers to get as much to eat as they can, and '* watch 
your weight" to us means — be on the lookout against under- 
weight in buying food stuffs, either from stores or pushcarts, 
though under frantic competition you can hardly blame a push- 
carteer for taking any sort of advantage — to keep alive. 

The chain stores do not underweigh as much as individual stores, 
as a rule, yet their managers are charged with the full weight of 
bulk articles and have to make up the waste in measuring out or 
pay it from their own pockets. They'd be fired for giving under- 
weight, but in rush hours it's humanly impossible not to spill or 
lose some of the company's property. So this has to be made up 
somehow out of careless customers. One thing is sure, the customer 
must never get a break, in overweight. We got a good laugh re- 
cently when a chain store clerk weighed out a pound of biscuits for 
us. He had an accurate eye and was worried when the last biscuit 
brought the weight to a canary feather over a pound. He took the 
biscuit off, but the scale then showed a little under, so what was he 
to do, with us watching? He broke the biscuit in half and ate the 
overweight himself. 

The other day we ordered a chicken by telephone and it came 
with a bill for ^1.75, the weight marked on the package was 5^ 

93 



94 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

pounds at 2^i each pound. That bird felt so light we weighed it and 
found it had gone down to 3^^ pounds, but we had paid the bill 
and it was too late to kick, for the butcher would answer it lost 
the 2>^ pounds in dressing. So we said ''Never again"; we'll stand 
right by the scale and try to intimidate the butcher into giving us 
what we pay for. WeVe developed a lot of false modesty about such 
things, which has been encouraged by those who profit by our fear 
of supervising what we pay for, or bargaining. 

So, nowadays, "full weight" usually includes the butcher's 
thumb, and we had a friend in this business who stuck his scale up 
high so when he read it at a slant it always showed a few ounces 
more than it would at a level reading. In that way he added an 
easy 10% to 20% to his profit. 

Buying mushrooms, however, is the trickiest thing of all. In 
New York we tried half a dozen different dealers and never got 
more than ^ of a pound for a full pound. When we were sure of our 
ground we used to kid these dealers about it and they had only one 
defense, "Mushrooms are too high in Washington Market. We 
gotta ask a low price or you won't buy, so to get anything for our- 
selves we've just got to weigh light." Then they'd toss in a couple 
of tiny button mushrooms to show their hearts were in the right 
place, but when we got home our scale still showed the old %" 
pound. 

By way of contrast, when we lived in Moscow, grocery clerks 
who had nothing to fear, would give us exact weight, cutting a last 
snip of bread to balance the scale precisely at i kilo. With nothing 
to gain or lose in non-profit commerce we got full value — to a 
kopek. 

So now, back home, by way of self protection we keep a reliable 
spring scale in the kitchen drawer and it's paid for its cost over and 
over. And the best part of it is, our local dealers know that the 
scale is there and that's a healthy threat that pays dividends in 
more food for our money. 

Another crafty cheat, which extends to toilet articles and all sorts 
of human needs, is for the big controllers to steadily enlarge the 
package and make it flossier, to cover periodical reductions in net 
weight, but none in price. Even if the fixed price hasn't gone up, 



WATCH YOUR WEIGHT ! 95 

the net contents have been so subtly reduced that soon we're ac- 
tually paying double the original price without noticing it. And 
here the profitable fad of reducing comes in. The owners of our 
staffs of life have taken advantage of this reducing rage to make 
everything smaller (except the containers), on the theory that the 
smaller the portion the healthier, or the more they reduce what we 
get for our money, the better off we are. 




XII. Dishes for Knife^ Fork and Spoon 

A false notion of elegance, probably instigated by penurious 
restaurant owners, has gradually depleted an historic class of fine 
family dishes until even home versions are often quite useless for 
either nourishment or enjoyment. Our soups come on the table 
strained, or with little bits of this and that, chips of carrot, two or 
three green peas to a plate, infinitesimal crumbs of meat, floating in 
a weak hot liquid just to give the illusion of what a really good 
soup might have been made of. Our stews often are served with 
scarcely enough gravy to moisten a crushed potato, just because 
magazines for real "ladies" require that gravy must be mixed with 
solids on the plate in such a manner that it can be gathered up with 
a fork. Spoons for this purpose are strictly taboo. We must eat 
daintily and follow the rules, regardless of heartiness and pleasure. 
Away with the great dishes intimately eaten with knife, fork and 
spoon — all three. 

While European workers and all gypsies and artists enjoy well- 
balanced meals in one hearty course eaten with any and every 
kind of table gear at hand, we as a nation have fallen under the spell 

96 



DISHES FOR KNIFE, FORK AND SPOON 97 

of many-course meals with special forks for salad, bread and butter 
knives and tiny ice cream shovels, just one silly tool after another 
with which to toy with miniature "courses." So nowadays people 
who can least afford it will start a dinner, especially if there's 
company, with half a pound of assorted synthetic sausage from the 
delicatessen, followed by a thin soup, maybe more costly because 
it's out of cans, then an entree before the regular meat dish, and 
always a characterless salad with a dab of bottled mayonnaise, 
probably made of cottonseed oil, and finally a fancy dessert and 
coffee. This, naturally, is the most wasteful procedure possible. 
So we say — a curse on the '* course" system. All of those Httle 
dabs put together don't make nearly as much of a meal as one big 
dish well-rounded out with meat, vegetables and the soup or gravy 
that comes with it, or one big salad, either of them accompanied 
by good, well-knit bread, not this light-as-chicken-feathers white 
stuff. Such a simple meal is the cheapest that any family can in- 
vest in, even though it actually costs more than any one course of 
the conventional meal. 

For when the real cost of one big satisfying dish is counted, sim- 
ply by dividing it by the number of eaters, it's sure to be less than 
any five-course dinner where four-bits has gone for more or less 
useless appetizers, thirty cents for an insipid salad and another 
half-dollar for drug store ice cream blown up with a bicycle pump, 
without counting the main dish, which is all that hunger really 
hollers for. Such a meal, after counting in the celery, olives, cottony 
bakery cake, and other bits of conventional swank, comes to any- 
way fifty cents a head, because a few of the courses, and probably 
those least appreciated, cost out of all proportion to the substantial 
ones. So it's hard to say which dish is expensive and which is cheap, 
because this always depends on the satisfaction the eater gets out 
of it. 

On top of this there's the extra labor and fuss, which is entirely 
eliminated by a single well-balanced and bounteous dish that has 
everything and is accompanied by a plenitude of honest bread and 
one good relish, or one meaty salad and a whole quart of fine ripe 
olives with plenty of crusty, yet juicy, well-made bread, either 
of which leaves the diner better satisfied, and certainly at a cost 



98 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

of less than half the standardized dinner. Indeed, one more-or-less 
useless course may cost even more than a big all-around hot potful 
that has everything. 

The idiocy of "courses" is well pictured in the story of a cook 
to the Great Conde who felt so disgraced when a fish failed to 
come in time to serve it after the soup that he "killed himself with 
his sword and drew his last breath just as the fish arrived.'* 

Other nations cherish and preserve their soupy stews, consider- 
ing them worthy to appear on elegant as well as simple tables. 
Spanish people, no matter where they live, always have the olla 
podrida in the mother land, their cosidas in the countries south of 
us, and that diWm.^ puchero of the Argentine; the Italians have their 
multitudinous minestras; Russians and Central Europeans eat 
those grand borschts and even more substantial cabbage soups in 
which slices of meat are couched to satisfy the most ravenous 
hunger; and the French make a ritual of their pot aufeu. Any of 
these, plus a plenteous relish of pickled peppers, onions, radishes, 
olives, cole slaw, or any salad, for the vitamins, and a light dessert, 
are all the heart and watering mouth desire. But try to get a knife- 
fork-and-spoon dish in America, except in a foreign restaurant or 
home, or in some artist's studio. 

Artists are especially adept at the one-dish meal, bringing to its 
composition their genius for balanced composition, color and inven- 
tion. It may be only a steaming kettle of spaghetti, but the sauce 
will be thought out with care and then done with a flair. It will 
contain all the food elements for health and strength, and with 
attention undivided among several other saucepans, that one 
spaghetti pot will be kept boiling just right, will be removed from 
the heat at the psychological second so it won't cook soggy, will 
be drained with care and given just the right dousing of cold water, 
to make it perfect 

A life-loving genius like Brancusi gets as much kudos in Paris 
for his creative cooking as for his modern sculpture. He assembles 
whatever he has in the cupboard when guests arrive, and beginning 
with a deftness worthy ofa,coj'don bleu^ molds and slaps the ingredi- 
ents together into an original dish which is said never to be a 
duplicate of any other he has made. He, like so many other artists, 



99 

is a one-dish-is-a-meal cook, and when that dish is done everyone 
eats of it ecstatically. And because of such creative achievements, 
cooking in France has been officially recognized as the eighth art. 
And here is a small gallery of Gallic culinary cornerstones, quite as 
perfect in their v/ay as the classic sculptures and columns of ancient 
Greece. 

POT AU FEU 

Any of the cheaper cuts of beef will serve, but rump and shoulder 
are the preferred pieces, with a length of marrow bone to give rich- 
ness. Rump takes the longest cooking, approximately one third 
more time than brisket, or other cut from the fore quarter of the 
animal.

Place meat in cold water over moderate fire and heat 35-40 
minutes without allowing it to reach boiling point. Skim every few 
minutes. Increase heat and add i tablespoon salt, which will bring 
remaining scum to the surface so it can be removed. Cut leeks into 
finger lengths and wind with thread so they will not fall apart in 
cooking; pierce onion with cloves and add with remaining ingredi- 
ents. Skim again when vegetables begin to cook. Reduce heat, cover 
closely and keep barely at the boiling point until done. The four 
essential points are: (i) careful skimming; (2) slow even heat; (3) 
a close-fitting cover that does not allow the aroma to escape; (4) 
never add more water to the pot while cooking or the flavor will be 
ruined. 

Taste of the pot during the last half-hour of cooking and add 
additional salt if necessary. Take up meat and vegetables, and keep 
them hot. Skim fat from soup, strain, and reheat; pour it over sip- 
;pets of toasted or fried bread. At the French family table the platter

what he likes to put into his soup plate, then the solid portions are 
eaten with knife and fork, and the liquid with a whopping big soup 
spoon, and the more spoon music the better, though the polite 
French never go as far as Orientals who belch loudly and smack 
their lips like firecrackers to show full appreciation of food. 

A big enamelware saucepan will turn out a fair pot au feu, an 
iron kettle is better, but the choice of all cooking utensils for this 
is an earthenware pot set on an asbestos ring to protect it from 
direct flame. Aluminum is the most unwholesome material in 
which to prepare any food, especially if it is to be cooked for a long 
time while chemical action is taking place on the metal. 

RAGOUT 

A ragout is simply a refined French name for a mulligan or Irish 
stew made with any kind of meat, cooked or fresh, left-over 
tidbits of fowl, and always potatoes, with any other vegetables, of 
course, and one clove of garlic, minced. 

A savory way to start a ragout of cooked meat is to get two table- 
spoons of olive oil smoking hot in a big black kettle. Let it cool for 
a minute and fry in it the garlic with any minced vegetable or 
mixture of, say, green peppers, onions, carrots and turnips. Then 
put in your cooked meat, chopped into handy-sized chunks, cover 
with boiling water in which a couple of beef cubes have been dis- 
solved, or any broth, add half as much thickly sliced potatoes as 
meat and simmer until tender, seasoning of course. 

If you use fresh meat start the other way around by heating a 
little fat in the kettle and frying in it a pound or two of beef or 
mutton, cut in small pieces, add a little water, salt and pepper. 
Then add plenty of sliced potatoes, onions, carrots, or what you will 
(a cooked sliced beet is always nice and its blood enriches the color 
of the ragout), and let everything simmer till tender. 

No dish offers a better chance for originality and if you add mush- 
rooms and wine with the cocks' combs we throw away, though the 
French sell them at dollars a pound, you can have a Millionaire 
Mulligan, the type called Ragout a la Financiere on ritzy bills-of-fare. 

But ordinarily, the simpler the ragout, the better, and here's a 
story to illustrate: 



DISHES FOR KNIFE, FORK AND SPOON lOI 

COOK'S CHOICE 

Professional cooks do simple dishes for themselves which they 
prefer to the fancy ones they make for their employers. In Cla- 
risse, or the Old Cook, we find this illuminating anecdote: The 
"master," named Brumaque, is dining alone while his cook Sophie 
is out on an errand: "He starts by filling two of his glasses with 
Loka and White Sicilian and, comfortably seated before a huge 
table, where, on a snowy cloth river trout, Loire carp au bleu, with 
its caviar, a pate of wild duck liver au grand Tivollier, a truffle 
salad, prawns cooked a la Lorraine, black grapes, velvety peaches 
and barberry preserve please the eye, makes ready to eat, when lo ! 
through the crack of the door a most delicious smell steals to his 
nostrils, making his mouth water. 

"Brumaque rises and follows the savory trail, which leads to his 
own kitchen. O joy! Sophie the cook is absent. With a trembling 
hand the amateur takes the cover off the saucepan from which 
escapes the enticing smell and there, ye immortal gods! he sees the 
dish! It is one of those which an artist makes for herself and never 
for her master, a ragout of mutton, the ideal golden-brown ragout, 
with a thick sauce transparent and warm in color, and potatoes 
that are like living topazes. Trembling, like the thief he is, Bru- 
maque carefully helps himself to the stew and eats, tasting it, 
relishing it, and devouring it with such gusto that the plate is licked 
clean, washed, cleaned better than by a dog. But the terrible Sophie 
returns; furious, with her arms akimbo: 

"*So,' she says, *you have stolen my food!* 

"* Well,' says the master, pale and smiling faintly, 'you can have 
mine.' 

"'This time I will let it pass,' says the cook severely, *but don't 
let it happen again. I don't eat your nastiness.' "

Soak and parboil beans. Cut bones from mutton and simmer to 
make a broth; and if you have a piece of fowl, a goose or duck 
carcass, or any other tasty leftover, throw it in with the mutton 
bones. Start simmering onion in fat, add garlic, then mutton, and 
let all slowly brown; take out mutton, add tomato to pan and 
simmer until thick. Place bacon rind in bottom of a wide saucepan 
or earthenware casserole, add onion mixture, then a few beans and 
some of the meat; alternate beans and meat, seasoning each layer, 
until all are used. Pour in the strained juice, cover very closely and 
simmer for about 3 hours. The French often buy a piece of goose 
to include with the other meats, but there are only a few foreign 
butcher shops in our cities which will accommodate their customers 
by selling portions of poultry. As for the sausage, there is nothing 
so good to give flavor to soups and stews as that smoked sausage 
sold for this purpose by Italian and Spanish grocers. 

BOUILLI, OR LEFTOVER BOILED BEEF 

Beef which had served for soup-making was once considered use- 
less and thrown away by prodigal American housewives, until our 
chemists discovered that such meats still contain valuable food 
elements that are not dissolved by boiling. French cooks, however, 
have always made tasty and nourishing dishes out of the remains 
of their soup pots, to serve on the following day. 

REHEATED SOUP MEAT

XIII. Mulligans^ SlumguUionSy 
Lobscouses and Burgoos 

MULLIGAN 

This American specialty of tramp jungles cannot be reduced to 
one recipe, for its ingredients depend on what you've got, its mix- 
ture on the artistic inspiration of the cook, and the time required 
for cooking entirely on the hunger of the eaters-to-be. 

Here's a sample, however, based on the take of a lucky day: 

3 POUNDS OF MEAT SCRAPS }4 CABBAGE, SHREDDED 

1 BUNCH CARROTS I POUND POTATOES 

2 ONIONS, SLICED SALT AND PEPPER 

t Start the meat cooking, then add the vegetables, stirring occa- 
sionally so the potatoes, which sink to the bottom, won't stick 
there. 

The word Mulligan is American slang which the dictionary says 
is obscure in origin, but it seems probable that it's the knight of the 
road's mocking abbreviation of the millionaire's Mulligatawny, a 

104 



MULLIGANS, SLUMGULLIONS, LOBSCOUSES, ETC. I05 

chicken and curry soup, which is no better than a jungle Mulligan 
after a successful raid on a hen roost and a farmer's field. 

The addition of dumplings makes it equal to any dollar-a-plate 
stew at the Waldorf. Everything goes into it to make the savor 
irresistible, especially such sauces as the oil from a can of sardines 
and the liquid from bottles of pickles and olives. 

SLUMGULLION 

Jack London's recipe for slumgullion is both simple and appe- 
tizing: Fry half a dozen slices of bacon, add fragments of hardtack, 
then two cups of water and stir briskly over the fire. In a few min- 
utes mix in slices of canned corned beef and season well with pepper 
and salt. 

Although this is a sailor's specialty, it has spread to the army, to 
hunting and fishing camps and the jungles, where, of course, any 
stew is called "slum.'Mt can be made of any meat and vegetables 
available, with hardtack or pilot crackers as a base, and it is 
usually highly seasoned. 

The name was bestowed on this dish centuries ago by British 
tars, combining the contemptuous '*slum," meaning worthless 
junk, with **gullion," their word for stomach ache. That accurately 
described their ration of thin stew, only a little better than the 
boiled seaboot they might have to subsist on if shipwrecked. 

But the ingenuity of poverty raised slumgullion from a weak, 
insipid stew to a rich flavorsome hot pot to which all peasants of the 
sea and millionaire yachtsmen alike are now addicted. It reaches 
perfection when boiled up by sailors stranded on the beach, for 
galley cooks in port look after their own by putting aside tidbits to 
fill the blackened stewcans which are lowered to them secretively 
from the wharves all the way from Shanghai to Buenos Aires. 

LOBSCOUSE, LOBSCOURSE, OR SCOUSE 

Lobscouse is the sailor's stew and a lobscouser is a sailor — so, 
like the chicken and the egg, it's hard to tell which came first. 

This highly nautical stew also is based on sea biscuit, and the 
proper way to make it is to soak several big round hunks of hard- 
tack in water or milk, using this substantial dough to make a thick 



Io6 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

pudding with any kind of meat and vegetables, usually limited to 
onions, potatoes and/or carrots, especially on shipboard. Sometimes 
the savory porridge is baked at the finish, but it's always made hot 
with pepper, and since all A.B.'s have able-bodied appetites as well, 
it goes down like truffles and ortolans at Delmonico's. 

Another recipe: pound hardtack to powder, mix with potatoes 
and salt beef chopped in cubes and either boil or moisten with water 
and bake. The dish must be hot with pepper and rich with fat, 
since "lob" means "a hanging lump of fat." But when there's no 
meat to put in you call it ** bread scouse" and bake it. 

BURGOO 

Burgoo is the twin of lobscouse, but with oatmeal in place of 
hardtack. It was brought to our shores by British seamen and be- 
came popular at early barbecues and picnics. Now it is the camper's 
delight. Like all the other manly stews in this salubrious section, 
burgoo calls for meat and vegetables, but since it's mostly cooked 
outdoors and on dry land today, the meat usually is game and the 
vegetables come fresh from some farmer's field when his back is 
turned. It's made more flavorsome by the addition of wild herbs 
and greens such as poke salad, parsley, sage and thyme. 

Sailors camping ashore jungle-up in any tumbletown shack and 
manage to club together meats and vegetables that are kettled into 
thick soups and savory stews which some chefs would have a hard 
time beating. And any of the above are perfect for" barbecues, pic- 
nics and organizational get-togethers. 




XIV. Barbecuing Indoors and Out 

Recently the old-fashioned barbecue has been brought right into 
the kitchen and nothing's more popular than doing meats and fish in 
what's called barbecue style, although one of those old French 
buccaneers who brought it to this country centuries ago would 
hardly recognize it. For instance, modern Barbecued Ham consists 
of crisping thin slices of cold boiled ham in butter, pushing it to the 
side of the pan while you heat up i teaspoon of mustard and another 
of sugar in the spluttering butter with two tablespoons of vinegar 
pepped up with plenty of pepper. You move the crisped ham back 
into this snappy sauce, let it simmer a couple of minutes and serve 
on thin slices of bread or crackers. 

As for Barbecued Fish, it takes a lot of beating, and any fresh 
medium-sized fish will do. After it's scaled, cleaned and washed you 
split it down the back, yank out the back bone and lay it skin side 
down in a pan which it should nearly fill. Sprinkle on plenty of salt 
and pepper, dot with a couple tablespoons of butter and brown in a 
hot oven, basting with the butter that melts. When it's golden 
brown put the pan over a stove-top flame for five final minutes, re- 
move fish and keep it warm in a hot platter while you toss up an 
instantaneous barbecue sauce by stirring into the pan-juice of fish 
and butter a pint of boiling water, salted and pepped up with soy 
sauce, mustard, chilies or whatever fiery condiments you fancy 

107 



I08 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

with fish, never forgetting a few drops of Tabasco. Let everything 
boil two minutes while you stir, then pour this sauce over the fish 
and eat it piping hot. 

As for outdoor barbecuing, the revival is on. Up in Hillsboro, New 
Hampshire, the century-old barbecue oven of President Pierce has 
been restored on the picturesque banks of the Contoocook River, 
and down in White Sulphur Springs, West Virginia, the picnic hay 
rides of 1837, ending in corn roasts around the old barbecue pit, 
were revived during Old White Week, with hillbilly dance-downs 
to the tune of "Turkey in the Straw'* and "All Bound 'Round with 
a Woolen String." Out in Michigan a duplicate of President Pierce's 
whole-ox roaster is doing its historic duty in feeding flocks of holi- 
day makers, and there's no better way to finish a Labor Day parade 
than to throw a big barbecue. 

Like a prairie fire the hungry flames have spread from camp cook- 
ing in the ashes to portable grills, charcoal pots and outdoor fire- 
places in the back yard, with everybody getting ashes, smoke and 
cinders in his eyes over pits and spits on one holiday or another, 
snacking on chickens scented with green apple-wood smoke, pic- 
nicking on meats broiled sweet over coals of corncob and walnut 
bark, everything smacking with grandmother's herbs that have 
also staged a comeback. 

For now we've gone native American, and there's nothing that 
quite fills the hole of hunger like one of those soul-satisfying barbe- 
cue sandwiches that have turned some of the old Robert E. Lee 
highways into one mouth-watering sign that reads: "Old Style Pit 
Barbecue with Green Hickory Wood." 

The genuine article in this line consists of luscious thin slices of 
crackling hot roast pork, and pork only, with just enough crisp, 
mellow fat on it so butter becomes redundant. It has to be gener- 
ously stacked between slices of good well-knit bread or a split bis- 
cuit, piping hot and homemade, we hope, and everything lavishly 
sluiced with a real barbecue sauce that has pep, zest, what it takes 
and then some! It should taste "the most more-ish," as Nantucket 
Islanders say of their chicken chowder "squantum," which is an- 
other specialty of our rekindled outdoor fires. Down South, the 
mingled savor of pork and hickory wood rising from the pit sets the 



BARBECUING INDOORS AND OUT IO9 

traveler's nose to twitching half a mile away and starts the old taste 
buds to blossoming out like sunflowers. And when finally you bite 
into that Old Style Sandwich it answers back sharply to the cave- 
man appetite that yips and yaps way down deep within the best 
of us. 

With many of us catching our meals on wheels, and hardly able 
to wait for the next snack counter that's always just around the 
corner, small wonder that barbecue stands have grown as thick as 
filling stations, especially as we cross the Mason and Dixon Line. 
And from there on to the Mexican border the sauce gets hotter and 
hotter. 

This is as it should be, since those little red peppers that serve as 
the real base of this All-American culinary art are native to Mexico, 
and all the way down to the State of Tabasco we find dabsters 
stirring up salsa de barbacoa. That's the tastiest stuff we've ever 
dabbled a crackling brown slab of roast pork in. The recipe should 
be on the tip of every tongue — just get yourself a flock of limes and 
squeeze out about half a glass of juice; use lemon, vinegar, white 
wine or sherry if you must, though the result won't be nearly so 
Mejicano without those limes. But first chop up very fine a discreet 
amount of garlic with one big onion and cook it tenderly in plenty 
of butter, anyway a quarter pound. Then toss in your lime juice, 
with a couple of teaspoons of mustard and of salt, just ahead of two 
whopping tablespoons of good Texas chili powder, a can of thick 
tomato soup and half a cup of water. To get that extra foreign savor 
here's the secret: Crumble a bay leaf with some cumin seed in your 
palm and sprinkle it in, or try a modicum of sweet marjoram which 
grows as wild as sage along the border. Let all your ingredients get 
well acquainted by simmering them together for five minutes, 
stirring the while, and then you've got the real McCoy in meat 
spreads. 

Of course the best place to enjoy a real longhorn barbecue is 
down in Texas, where such parties are thrown to celebrate almost 
anything from a baptism to a by-election. So let us start out the day 
before the big party with a couple of those lean, pit-hardened ex- 
perts who pick out the prime fat steer, or steers, in plenty of time 
and superintend the digging of the fire holes and stacking of good 



no MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

hardwood handy before the real work begins — at midnight. They 
try to have everything ready by sundown on the day before so they 
can catch a few winks before arriving on the job at that witching 
hour, loaded down with lanterns, pitchforks, shovels, brooms, rakes, 
plenty of peppers and big bottles full of Worcestershire and 
Tabasco. And as soon as the pit fires are lighted you can see their 
silhouettes and shadows weaving like imps around the flames as 
they heap on the fuel, rake hot coals level, shovel in a little earth 
here to retard a blaze, pull out a hot stone there, gradually building 
a smooth, smokeless bed of embers, readying everything for the 
ravenous crowd that'll arrive around noontime with jaws raring to 
go. 

All in all, a hangup barbecue takes about twenty-four hours 
preparation and a lot of skill. The seasoned specialists in charge 
know their stuff as well as a strip tease knows her burleycue, and 
it's hot stuff, too, for first the juicy beef is soaked all the juicier 
in fiery chili-ajo, the standard marinating bath of a whole State 
that is as large as all Europe. Then each barbecuer mixes a second 
sauce for basting the beast, filling wash tubs sloshing full of minced 
peppers, garlic, herbs, tomatoes, lime juice and sundry condiments, 
according to formulas handed down within the craft. With this 
mixture the roasting longhorn is basted for eight solid hours, to 
give it that unbeatable hunter's style flavor, making tame beef 
taste as gamy as pioneer buffalo humps, grizzly bear steaks or elk, 
and Mary's little lamb like Rocky Mountain sheep. 

The enormous beef, run through from chin whiskers to tail, or 
**barbe" to "cue," with a sharp steel spit to hold it securely in 
place over the glowing pit, is kept turning by dexterous jabs of the 
pitchfork. A steel spit is the thing; never green wood, for steel is 
such a perfect conductor of heat that the inside of the meat will be 
as thoroughly cooked as the outside. The basting is done wholesale 
by dipping new brooms in the tubs of sauce and swabbing down the 
sides of meat evenly. 

After a first quick searing on all sides to seal the juices in, the 
slow roasting begins and continues from dawn till high noon, when 
a triumphant gleam comes into the chief chef's eye as he shoves his 
rolled shirt sleeves a notch higher and sharpens his carving kit, to 



BARBECUING INDOORS AND OUT III 

begin the real fancy work just at the moment when the outside crust 
is spiciest and the inside is cooked through to the bones. Crowds 
close in to watch the knife-wielding, each expecting to get the 
choicest tidbit as it*s expertly dipped in the hot sauce and slapped 
onto slabs of yaller bread. In this clash between sharp knives and 
sharper appetites, corn liquor passes freely and everything's hotsy- 
totsy. The tang of wood fires and odor of crisping beef whip up 
gargantuan appetites, especially if the artful barbecuer throws an 
armful of sage on the dying coals at the finish to accent the whole 
roast — then the amount of lusty munching such a crowd can do is 
limited only by the size of its rounding eyes and whether the feast is 
free or not. 

Old-time pit barbecues on Southern plantations are much more 
ladylike than one that Senator Maverick might throw. They are 
staged in shady groves equipped with picnic tables on wooden 
trestles, stretching from one county to the next and carefully cov- 
ered with starched linen, hallmarked silver (if there's any left in the 
family), all set forth with pickles, fresh biscuits, jellies, watermelon 
and cake, besides the whole pigs, lambs and chickens roasted in- 
stead of the Texas steer — and with plenty of scuppernong wine 
punch in place of red-eye. 

But in barbecuing we have gone soft, for nowadays it doesn't 
really matter to most of us whether this unique kind of jamboree is 
held indoors or out, and compared to the pioneer and frontier feeds 
a small modern barbecue is a cinch. As a matter of fact, it doesn't 
take much more time or trouble than spitchcocking an eel or steam- 
ing an impromptu clambake on the beach, if not actually in the 
living-room fireplace. 

An indoor barbecue is done right at the kitchen range, either on a 
spit or in a roasting pan, perhaps in the dining room on one of those 
spifFy electric rotisseries, even in the lady's parlor over a charcoal 
grill that shoots its fumes up the fireplace chimney. In fact, such a 
citified version can be held in a sky-scraper, as was recently demon- 
strated by Mrs. Helen Angell, who walked off with the ^500 prize 
at the national cooking contest on the strength of barbecuing a leg 
of lamb in the ultramodern kitchen of a mid-Manhattan hotel. 

There's not much of the outdoors left in Mrs. Angell's barbecue 



112 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

of lamb, of course, except the tang of the sauce; and that's too ex- 
pensive. But here's how it's done: First rub salt and pepper over the 
leg and make a few slashes in it so the juice will run, then slap it into 
a roasting pan and leave the cover off so it can be constantly basted 
with this lavish sauce — half a bottle each of Worcestershire, A-i 
sauce and ketchup, with two tablespoons of butter and half a pound 
of fat, everything melted together and flavored with sugar, vinegar 
and a squirt or two from the Tabasco bottle. Then tie a whole sliced 
onion together with three cloves of garlic in a bit of cheesecloth, 
drop it into the exciting mixture and begin twirling your basting 
spoon. At the finish, all pan gravy is poured over the roast, so not a 
drop of meat essence is wasted. But to cheapen this sauce use soy 
and ground chilies in place of the more expensive Worcestershire 
and A-i to get just as salubrious an effect. 

Chicken may be barbecued in the same painless fashion. Just slit 
a broiler down the back, put it in a well-greased pan and sear it on 
both sides beneath a blistering fire. Then slow down the fire and 
when the bird is golden brown try this old Pennsylvania Dutch 
sauce for a change: Melt half a cup of butter and snap it up with a 
tablespoon of tomato paste, then toss in a third of a cup of vinegar, 
a tablespoon of soy, with some onion juice, salt, pepper and paprika, 
never forgetting those three buds of garlic, which should be taken 
out before serving to save the sensitive feelings of some who fear 
they'll get a sprained nose from a passing whiff of it. A paintbrush is 
excellent for daubing this on, and at the finish you'll have extra-fine 
dripping in which to dunk sippets of bread and fresh hot biscuit. 

Or buy three pounds of round steak and marinate it in a pint of 
American white wine made all the more intoxicating with a tea- 
spoon of genuine Texas chili powder — that is, all the more intoxi- 
cating in flavor, for none of the alcohol is left in the meat after it's 
cooked. When you add one grated onion and the inevitable clove of 
garlic you have the chili-ajo^ that spicy mixture of chilies and garlic 
in which most meats are drenched in Mexico and along the border. 
Turn the meat a few times while it's taking the stimulating wine 
bath, let it stay there a couple of hours; then take it out, dry it off 
and rub in salt, cayenne pepper and bacon grease. If possible, do the 
barbecuing over hot coals; if not, under the gas grill. 



BARBECUING INDOORS AND OUT II3 

The whole trick is in marinating, which softens and flavors the 
meat, and in basting lavishly with sauce of any peppery degree 
Fahrenheit. Naturally, there is no limit to suitable kinds of flesh, 
fish and fowl. Game is great in this fashion, especially obese young 
possum or porcupine, and tame ducks come out almost as tasty as 
wild ones. If you want a dish that will lay them in the hammocks, 
try Mexican Duck. 

The bigger and tenderer the better, so one fat duck is always a 
good buy; it costs about one-third less than chicken. Or you might 
get a better bargain in two small ones, although there'll be more 
bone to throw away. Whichever you choose, tie bay leaves over 
their protruding bay windows, dip 'em in a bath made with one cup 
of water and another of onion juice, chant a line of " California, 
here we come!" and dump in a whole pint of native sherry to keep 
the ducks contented. A quarter pound of butter will do to start 
things spluttering nicely and half that much olive oil, say a wine- 
glassful, to give that foreign smack. Besides salt and black pepper, 
half a teaspoon of red cayenne goes in and a whole tablespoon of 
dried marjoram. After sousing the ducks in their natty vests of bay 
leaf with plenty of this sauce you perch them on the grill and start 
basting. Turn them often and when they've acquired a regular life- 
saver tan just pop 'em into a roasting pan, give 'em a shower bath 
by dumping on all the liquid that's left; then let 'em sizzle away till 
you can't wait any longer. 

We Browns took up the fragrant trail in Texas some years ago 
and had the time of our young lives following it through big out- 
door frolics called fiestas campestras (countryside fetes) and bar- 
bacoas serranas (hillside barbecues). At most of these roundups the 
roasting was done on hot stones under the ground, and all the way 
through Mexico, Guatemala, Panama, Ecuador, Peru, Chile, the 
Argentine and Brazil we burned tongues and fingers in sampling 
local styles. 

We spent years with South American peons, senores, Indians, 
hidalgos and padraos, growling over our portions of venison, paca, 
wild pig and equally porcine armadillos cooked in their shells, with 
accompanying papas (potatoes), camotes^ chayotes and chuchu^ 
yams, tropical squashes and fruits roasted to a turn in the embers. 



114 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

In this way we learned the unbeatable succulence of Bermuda 
onions roasted all the sweeter in their skins, beets too, with the 
garden loam still clinging to them, wrapped in leaves and all the 
outside earth and skin shelled off before eating. A whole rainbow of 
both bananas and green corn, including green plantain and pink 
popcorn. All sorts of potatoes, both sweet and Irish, and that tasti- 
est of squash, the small one called acorn and nutmeg after its shape 
and likewise from its flavor being improved by a sprinkling of nut- 
meg. And the secret of the success of all these is the same as that 
with which we are familiar in roasting murphies in their jackets — 
the outside is instantly and hermetically sealed, so not one salubri- 
ous drop of juice can escape. 

At a Farmer-Labor get-together in Valparaiso, Chile, we sampled 
roast sheep tails sizzling with their own fat, drank pomegranate- 
flavored and -colored chicha from gay bull horns swung by broad 
ribbons around our necks and found out next morning that it leaves 
your head feeling as though it's been screwed up tight with a Still- 
son wrench. In Petropolis, the summer capital of Brazil, we built a 
clay oven of our own, the kind the Italians used to set up on vacant 
lots in New York's East Side to roast kids, steaming portions of 
which they wrapped up in fresh hearth bread to supply the early 
sandwich trade. In this above-ground barbecue we roasted every- 
thing from ducks to macuco, the local wild turkey, of which the 
crackling back strip including Pope's Nose and jewels is the most 
esteemed cut. Although monkeys chattered on the other side of the 
ravine and roast monkey delights any Brazilian, we thought the 
practice too cannibalistic.

Marketing 



There are lots of eye openers in the food market reports in finan- 
cial sections of daily papers, not intended for consumers' eyes but 
for the middle men and retailers who make money out of our uni- 
versal need to eat. There are tips on the best buys, what is in the 
height of the season and coming in so fast that there is too much 
even to go into cold storage — somebody slipped somewhere and 
the crop was not kept down to keep the price up. Here is published 
the illuminating lowdown on everything the housewife buys for 
her kitchen. It may not seem so interesting at first, because the 
information is condensed and is hard to remember. But those who 
profit by the market's ups and downs remember it well enough, 
you bet, and they are not faced with the problem of stretching 
the weekly income and keeping a family healthy and happy 
too. These vital statistics make good reading; it is best to take 
one food at a time to start, and then with the ranges of that one 
in mind, branch out and soon you'll find more diversion than in 
following the funnies. Poultry is especially illuminating. A neigh- 
bor of ours, in the only countrified district left within the limits 
of New York City, had forty hand-petted chickens, hatched this 
last Spring, all well-fed and of a kind and size most suitable for 
broiling and frying. She could no longer keep them and sent for 
a poultry dealer, who offered her 8 cents a pound and went off

in a hufF when she would not accept it. Our local butcher was 
selling similar ones for 30 cents a pound and up. So the woman 
chicken rancher is now eating her flock, one at a time, trying to 
forget sentiment and which pet was little Joe and which was Jane. 

Chain stores hand out lists of their weekly bargains worth taking 
advantage of, but in the light of what market reports tell us, the 
bulk of these bargains will go still lower next week. Most things, 
of course, are cheaper if bought in quantities instead of singly. 
But here the real estate promoters who plan our housing space 
seem to connive with the grocers by not allowing us room to store 
up food as the lowest prices come along. Any one of us though can 
find a shelf or so somewhere to fill a little at a time with packages 
and cans that do not spoil. It is a comfort besides, to feel ready 
for a sudden emergency, unexpected company, no pay day, or 
what not. 

The United States Bureau of Standards requires that substitute 
flavorings should be labelled ''flavoring" and that only the extracts 
of real vanilla, almond, lemon, etc. may be labelled "extracts." 
So we choose the extract rather than the flavoring and get the real 
thing. There is often little difference in price, and always much 
difference in taste. As to vanilla, the vanilla bean is vastly superior 
to any extract of it. For the average family a piece ^ inch long is 
sufficient to flavor a pudding, custard, or ice cream. After cooking 
the piece of bean should be taken out, wiped clean and kept for 
using again, several times; the last time split it open to allow all 
the taste to escape. 

We listen to the seductive voices of food advertisers as we would 
to the serpent, knowing that, for all the protection we get from 
government control of advertising, we can be misled to any extent 
as to the quality and wholesomeness of those sweet-sounding prod- 
ucts. The serpent stings a second time when we pay the price of 
each unctuous word and pretty picture. And when added up at 
the end of a year, a heavy price it is, tacked onto every package 
we open. Wouldn't it be nice if we could spend our yearly contri- 
bution to sponsored radio programs and slick magazine pages for 
more food, or the theater, parties, tropical fish, flowers — any 
hobby out of which we get real refreshment. 



MARKETING II7 



Although thus far we are licked at the start by our own fault, 
we can still put up a fight by giving moral support to conscientious 
progressive legislators, and by taking advantage of the little pro- 
tection they have succeeded in getting for us. Their limited record 
is on the food and drink labels, usually in the smallest print — 
the net weight, harmful chemical preservatives, occasionally the 
exact ingredients — and after a terrific struggle a few products like 
maple syrup have been forced to admit their adulterations. The 
label reader can refuse to buy any but the purest and best, even 
by this meager data given him. 

The most-advertised names often do not give the best value. 
A famous packer, for instance, puts up the most watery fruits 
and vegetables, the least solid food for the money, a fact not re- 
vealed until the can is opened and conteifts examined. And what 
a difference between the luscious picture on the outside and the 
sickly quality within! It is a pleasure to encounter a brand which 
lives up to its label artist's ideal. After sifting out the trash from 
the true, a duty we all owe the families which eat from our hands 
and the public each consumer represents, there is still that ques- 
tion of taste to consider, the most important feature of all quality. 
It is not always the fanciest looking stuff, raised for size and ap- 
pearance, that is best flavored. But every member of the family 
will be keen to vote on this point of taste as soon as the chance is 
given him. 

Meat labels are as deceptive as any. That purple stamp, which 
resembles a government inspector's, deceives sometimes, and 
when read turns out to be the butchering establishment's own 
statement. The housewife who takes an interest in her job of 
being the spender of hard and uncertain earnings has to be a keen 
detective, as well. And a $3.00 membership in the Consumers 
Union will pay dividends, as will purchases from the growing 
consumers' cooperatives.

Polenta 



PLAIN POLENTA 

To I quart of boiling water add i teaspoon salt, then sprinkle 
in approximately i cup yellow cornmeal so slowly that it does not 
lump, stirring constantly. Continue to stir until it thickens and 
finish cooking over reduced heat, stirring often; or set in a double 
boiler. Cornmeal develops its best flavor thus, by being dropped 
directly into boiling water. If mixed with a little cold water first, 
as given in many recipes, just to save the trouble of stirring out 
any possible lumps, neither the texture nor the taste is as good. 

So far, this is the same mush that we usually eat as a breakfast 
cereal, with milk and sugar. Of course we also let it cool, slice 
and fry it, and serve it with syrup or gravy. But we seldom mix 
anything piquant with it, while the French, Spaniards and other 
Europeans, fix cornmeal mush in a number of delicious ways and 
eat it almost as commonly as the Italians, who call it Polenta, 
and with whom it is often the main dish of the evening meal. 

POLENTA WITH CHEESE (i) 

Lay tablespoons of hot mush in a hot dish, sprinkling each with 
grated cheese and a dash of cayenne or paprika. Lay more table- 
spoons of mush on top of these, sprinkle with more cheese until 
ail is used. Then brown under the grill — or eat as is. 

POLENTA WITH CHEESE (2) 

Make thick corn meal mush by sprinkling ^4 pound yellow corn 
meal, also called Indian meal, a little at a time, into i}4 pints 
salted boiling water. 

118 



POLENTA 119 



Remove i tablespoonful of mush at a time and lay it in a baking 
dish, being careful to preserve the oval spoon shape and keep each 
separated a little from the others. Sprinkle with grated hard cheese 
and moisten with butter browned in a pan, but not blackened. 
Put the dish in a hot oven for about 5 minutes to let the cheese 
melt in, then serve piping hot in the same dish it's baked in. 

POLENTA WITH MEAT GRAVY OR HASH 

Make a ring of rather thick cornmeal mush around the rim of a 
dish and fill center with hash or gravy. Or, lay the mush in a hot 
dish, a large spoonful at a time, make a little hollow in each spoonful 
and fill with hash. Build up in layers until all is used, cover with 
hash or gravy and sprinkle with a little grated cheese. The French 
do not depend on Parmesan for such dishes, as the Italians do, 
but save every bit of cheese scraps which are dried somewhat, 
then grated and kept in a jar until needed. 

POLENTA WITH TOMATO SAUCE 

Instead of meat gravy or hash in the preceding recipe use a 
tomato sauce made as follows:

Slowly fry onion and garlic in oil until golden; add tomato, 
parsley and thyme and fry until tomato thickens. Add beef cube 
dissolved in i cup boiling water (or i cup meat broth), strain, 
season and simmer until sauce thickens. 

SLICED POLENTA 

Slice cold cornmeal mush and lay in a baking dish, covering each 
slice with grated cheese, gravy, hash or tomato sauce. Build up 
in layers, cover with grated cheese and dots of butter, and brown 
under grill or in oven.

Slowly fry onion in i tablespoon of fat, add garlic and fry, then 
add carrot, or green pepper or a celery stalk, or better still, all 
three chopped fine, and cook for a couple of minutes. Add fried 
mixture to i quart salted boiling water, and when it bubbles fast 
sprinkle in the cornmeal; stir and cook until it thickens. Then 
cover and let simmer while you prepare the liver. Dice the liver, 
dredge well with flour, and season with cayenne. Heat remaining 

2 tablespoons of fat in same frying pan used before, and quickly 
brown the liver without letting it cook through; sprinkle with salt 
and add half a cup boiling water in order not to waste the flavors 
clinging to the pan, turn all into the cornmeal mixture, stir well, 
and cook another 5 minutes. Eat as is, or better, pour into a greased 
deep pan and let cool, then slice, dredge with flour and brown in 
fat or butter. 

Hamburger or sausage meat, in fact, any left-over cold meat, 
may be substituted for pig's liver, but will need to be cooked a 
little longer. 

ITALIAN POLENTA CROQUETTES 

Make corn meal mush as above, but stir in a little butter and 
grated cheese when it's done. Then take this richer mush out in 
the same way, by tablespoonfuls, but lay it on a surface, such as 
a slab of marble, and shape into egg-like ovals. Cover each with 
a thin slice of old Wisconsin cheese, pressing it down so it adheres 
to the corn meal. Let cool, then dip in beaten egg and bread crumbs 
and fry in deep fat. 

A slab of marble, the kind that used to top bed-room bureaus, 
can be had for a dime or so in almost any junk shop. It doesn't 
matter if a corner or two are broken off\, and you'll find it very 
handy for recipes like this which need a cold surface to help hold 
shapes — also for candy-making. 



POLENTA 121 



Old Wisconsin cheese costs up to 20 per cent more than ordinary- 
store cheese, but it has ripened for 3-4 years and lost probably 
20 per cent weight in water, at the same time gaining incomparably 
in flavor. So we consider it a much better buy than green store 
cheese. Besides, it's much more digestible. For most cooking pur- 
poses good old Wisconsin equals imported Holland, cheddar or 
Swiss. Old New York State cheese is also good, but the milk from 
which it's made is more likely to be mixed from different sections 
and states where cows are fed on different foods, while all Wisconsin 
cheese is made of milk of that State, which produces cheese uniform 
in flavor and richly mellow when aged.

Hot Stuff! 



The bakers provide the world with so many varieties of bread, 
and some of them good, that homemade bread is fast joining the 
extinct dodo. But we are still true to our hot breads, dyspepsia 
warnings notwithstanding, and only homemade muffins, corn- 
breads, biscuits and scones can be served piping hot from the oven 
to pep up a breakfast or a luncheon or, when masked with fruit, a 
dinner.

First turn on heat for quick action, then mix and sift dry in-

but not stiflF enough to knead; add a little water if more liquid is 
needed. Drop from tip of spoon into buttered muffin pans and bake 
12 to 15 minutes in hot oven (450 F.).

on bread board about ^ of an inch thick. Shape with a biscuit cut-

ble. Add /i cup of grated cheese to dough before patting out and 
you will have, when baked, a savory biscuit that, with a bowl of 
salad, will make a complete luncheon. 

FRUIT SHORTCAKES 

With fruit in season, or fruit in cans, a fruit shortcake is a quickly 
made dessert and a decidedly satisfying finish to a plain dinner. Of 
course it should never follow a heavy one. Add 2 tablespoons short- 
ening and I tablespoon sugar to biscuit recipe and prepare dough. 
Roll or pat it out into 2 rounds. Spread one with a little soft butter, 
place the other on top, put in round pan and bake in hot oven 
(450 F.). When done and while warm, not hot, separate and put 
previously prepared fruit between layers and on top.

Fill a deep buttered baking dish with slices of tart apples, add a 
very little water, dredge with sugar, add bits of butter and sprinkle 
with cinnamon or grated nutmeg. Cover with baking powder bis-

(375° F.). Invert on platter and serve with cream or any creamy 
sauce. 

It would be hard to find anything tastier or cheaper than this 
apple dish that put hair on the chest of our pioneers in log cabin 
days. 

The basic recipe for biscuit dough is found in all cook books and 
most pamphlets. It is repeated at the beginning of this section on 
hot, toothsome stuff because of the many truly cheap and tooth- 
some dishes it will father, and the more important fact that any 
amateur can make them.

Bran may not be as good for you as the blowers-up of cheap

gerous in systems that can't stand any more roughage than they 
already get. But it does make a mighty tasty muffin. So if you can 
take it, and can still find at a fair price this stuff" they used to feed 
the cows, by all means try the above recipe. 

Life gets mighty dull on rations of the same cottony white bread 
every day, so if you've got the time to make hot breads such as this 
you'll find the family whooping with pleasure; for freshly cooked 
grains are hot stuflF for a change. And if you haven't much time be- 
fore breakfast buy them from the baker and at the same time get 
some good juicy rye bread, oatmeal, whole wheat, or anything more

real and chewy than that chalky white loaf which only fattens the 
big baking companies. And don't buy bread already sliced. It may 
taste as good as the kind you cut yourself, but you're sure to waste 
some of it, and that's the manufacturer's intention. He cuts it 
thick so you'll either eat more than you want or leave some uneaten 
to be thrown away, and when it comes to those end crusts he's 
clever as the devil; they're cut too thin to make toast and too thick 
to nibble unless you're a crust-hound, so the result nine times out 
of ten is that these leathery little heels, which comprise anyway 
3^0 of the weight of the loaf, are thrown away. At a dime a loaf 
that's io% gone — to excess profits, and bakery dividends. 

We always save these heels, dry them crisp at any time when the 
oven is cooling, roll them fine and store them in a jar which is dipped 
into many times a day. Cookbook recipes for stuffings say to cut off 
crusts of bread, because, perhaps, it is usually so fresh that the 
crusts are tough. If properly dried this is an unnecessary waste, 
for the crusts crush to crumbs and lend a nutty toasty flavor which 
improves a dressing and helps it to fulfill its purpose of enriching 
the taste of any food it goes into. 

Whole wheat, cracked wheat, and oatmeal breads make more 
appetizing stuffings that plain white, and a mixture of several is 
better still, while way-do wn-South corn bread is so prized for dress- 
ings that cooks bake up a specially big batch of it and let it grow 
stale when a turkey or something special is to be roasted. 

So many crumbs are used in France that bakers supply them at a 
very cheap price by weight, thus marketing their leftover loaves, 
crusts and all, just as our biscuit companies furnish us with pack- 
ages of cracker crumbs much cheaper than we can make them from 
whole crackers. 

So precious is stale bread in the kitchen that not a slice should 
ever be wasted. Broken bits thrown into the soup pot are the best 
sort of thickening. Sifted crumbs are more tasty than flour for 
gravies; they make grilled and fried dishes delicious, form tempt- 
ing crisp tops of baked ones, and furnish the base of a dozen 
wholesome economical puddings, of bread omelet, bread and butter 
fritters, special bread soup, bread sauces, and even bread ice cream. 
And toasts of any sort give a family the feeling that they are eat- 



HOT stuff! 127 



ing at a luxury table, especially if creamed vegetables or gravied 
hashes are poured over while the toast is still hot and crunchy. 

CINNAMON TOAST 

Cut crusts from sliced stale white bread and save for other uses. 
Toast on one side. Brush other side with melted butter, sprinkle 
, with a mixture of cinnamon and sugar, and brown under broiler. 

ORANGE TOAST 

Cut stale bread in slices about i inch thick. Remove crusts, then 
cut in three pieces crosswise. Toast on one side. Brush other side 
with melted butter and sprinkle with a mixture of half cup of sugar 
blended with one-quarter cup of grated orange rind and two table- 
spoons orange juice. Toast under the grill just long enough for bub- 
bles to rise. 

COCOANUT TOAST 

Cut bread slices into fingers 1 inches long and ^ inch wide; 
cover all sides with evaporated or condensed milk; roll in dry 
shredded cocoanut which has been crumbled between the hands. 
Set in a greased pan and delicately brown on all sides in the oven, 
or toast on a fork over coals. 

FRENCH TOAST 

If bread is very dry dip first in sweetened milk, flavored or not 
with vanilla, then dip each slice in beaten egg, and fry in butter, 
delicately browning both sides. 

If bread is not so stale make a batter of i egg beaten with >^ cup 
of milk and % teaspoon salt, sweetening it if you prefer. Dip both 
sides of slices in the mixture and fry. Serve very hot. 

Sweetened French toast, eaten with syrup, jelly, jam or marma- 
lade, or with powdered sugar and sprinkling of lemon juice, is an 
appetizing breakfast dish. Or it makes an equally good dessert 
with any sweet pudding sauce. Left unsweetened, it can be fried in 
bacon fat and served with meat gravy or hash. 



128 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

FRUIT FRENCH TOAST 

Lay a drained slice of tinned pineapple, or a pear or peach half, 
on French toast, sprinkle generously with sugar and brown in oven 
or under grill. Cinnamon bread or rolls make good French toast, es- 
pecially when topped with slices of fried apple or with applesauce. 

THE CLUB SANDWICH 

A lettuce lear spread with salad dressing, a slice of fried bacon 
and two slices of toast to lay them between is the beginning of any 
club sandwich. Then let imagination and leftovers run riot to build 
it as high as hunger demands, even to three decks of toast. It may 
include a tomato slice, a bit of potato or cucumber salad, chopped 
celery, cut-up olives, pickles, nuts, slices of hard-cooked egg, a 
slice of leftover cold meat. It may be composed of cold fish, sardines 
or canned salmon, and the things that go with these. In any case, a 
club sandwich is always a refuge for a flurried woman when some 
member of the family needs a tempting meal in a hurry. 

CROUTONS AND BREAD CUPS 

For croutons cut stale bread into ^-inch cubes. For bread cups 
cut into lyi. inch cubes and hollow out a cup in each one. Fry in 
plenty of fat, hot enough to brown them at once. Drain well on 
layers of absorbent paper. Serve croutons with soup, and use the 
cups like patty shells, to fill with any little delicacy in cream sauce 
or gravy. 

PLAIN WHEAT BREAKFAST FOOD 

WHOLE WHEAT GRAIN SUGAR MILK 

Take a small quantity of wheat grain just as it's produced by the 
farmer, remember that it swells in cooking, and parboil it for 5 
minutes to keep it from fermenting. Let it stand in the water for 
24 hours, then add milk to make a breakfast cereal of good consist- 
ency and cook it for ^2 hour, without letting the milk come to a boil. 

Serve with cold milk or cream and sugar, just like any other 
breakfast food. 

This dish costs little more than the milk and sugar that's put on

it at the finish, for you can buy a bushel of wheat for about $1.25 
from the farmer or a consumers' co-op, enough to make more than 
1,000 generous dishes, at a cost of about i mill apiece. 

Many a wise farmer has figured out that his bushel of wheat, 
which weighs 60 pounds and may bring him anything from 50^!^ to 
$1.50, is blown up or rolled out into "whole wheat breakfast food" 
retailed in fancy boxes at around 15^ for 6 ounces, or say J250.00 a 
bushel. This is a small profit ranging from 8,000% to 25,000%, 
depending on the price paid to the farmer. So he takes his wheat 
whole in the above fashion and gets a superior breakfast food be- 
sides, for nothing can equal the rich nutty flavor of wheat grains 
stewed slowly in milk. 

This flavor, of course, can be enriched by sprinkling on cinnamon 
sugar, or melting a little butter instead of milk or cream in the 
individual cereal dish, and a handful of currants or raisins makes 
it almost a plum pudding. 

FROM-POVERTY-TO-RICHES PANCAKES 

The cheapest and at the same time the best honest-to-goodness 
pancake we know was described in a newspaper by a Nebraskan 
woman, as follows: 

My invalid husband and I were compelled to spend the summer in the 
mountains one year. Our funds were low and I knew that something must 
be done at once. But what? Finally I thought of this way out of my diffi- 
culty. I need only to say that some days I made as high as four dollars for 
you to know how successfully my plan turned out. 

I noticed that many hunters and fishermen passed our way, so I hung 
out a sign with "Hot Coffee and Pancakes — 25 cents" on it. I made good 
strong coffee, serving only sugar with it. Only syrup was served with the 
pancakes, which I made by the following recipe, which is excellent and 
inexpensive: 

One pint of flour; one pinch of salt; one heaping teaspoonful of baking 
powder; one heaping tablespoonful of sugar. Mix thoroughly dry. Add 
warm — not hot — water till the batter is thick as heavy cream and beat 
well. Pour in size of pancake wanted on a smoking-hot griddle. Never 
spread this batter with a spoon. 

After trying this, there's no need blowing money on prepared 
pancake flours any more.

good consistency. Grease the griddle well and bake a rich brown. 

For $2.50 you can get a small grist mill suitable to make fine 
meal out of whole grains of wheat, rye or corn. It should pay for 
itself in a few months. And a common coffee mill will do the job, 
too. In this way you have not only fresh pancake makings but at a 
cost which is only a fraction of prepared pancake mixtures.

2 EGGS SALT

Beat eggs, salt them and stir in as much flour as the eggs will 
take, moistening with the beef stock dissolved in only a tablespoon 
of warm water. Knead with fingers till you have a smooth, soft 
dough, adding flour until the right texture. Roll out very thin and 
let stand 5 minutes. Then roll with care into a long thin rod and 
slice the whole roll very thin, to make succulent strips, or noodles. 

If you happen to live near Chinatown or even a Chinese restau- 
rant it is just about as cheap to buy the noodles damp and fresh 
from experts in this line who make them in all colors, of all sorts of 
appetizing flours and oriental flavors. We buy fresh noodles from a 
maker on Mott Street in New York for 10^ a pound and they go 
a whole lot farther than a loaf of bread at 10% higher cost, and also 
taste better than the dry, packaged commercial noodles. 

There is no end to the number of cheap and quick dishes you can

deep in the pan and smoking hot. Flatten out noodles in bottom 
of pan and fry slowly until golden, then turn with pancake turner 
and fry the other side; 10-15 i^ii^utes are required. Remove noo- 
dles, drain the oil and save for future frying. 

Though chow mein is the standard side-kick of chop suey, it*s 
just as crisply palatable as French fried potatoes with any meat or 
stew.

Boil noodles in salted water, drain and put in bowls, cover with 
hot broth and garnish each with yi hard-cooked egg, several shreds 
of pork and chicken or other meat tidbits. Serve the soy sauce in a 
cruet or bottle for each person to season to suit himself. 

The Chinese use both cured pork and breast of chicken, but if 
these are not available, scraps of dried beef, corned beef or other 
cold meats are good. Fine broth can also be made from beef or 
chicken cubes, especially the Herb-Ox brand which have savory 
bits of greens in them. 

Soy sauce, made of salt and soy beans, is the base of Worcester- 
shire and other expensive table sauces. It costs about one-third 
and goes a whole lot farther, since it's undiluted. There's no better 
buy in condiments and any Chinese store will send soy, thick or 
thin, by mail, if you're not near enough to go and get it. The thin 
kind suits our taste best and in spite of its name is thicker than 
most occidental sauces. 

GO MEIN GANG 

This is a more elaborate Mein that calls for chicken broth, sliced 
mushrooms and bean sprouts in place of the egg. 

Make it the same as Yat Go Mein and dress it up with bits of 
smoked pork and chicken.

Sandwiches That Satisfy 



CANNIBAL SANDWICH 



ROUND STEAK, FRESH AND FINE 
ONION, MINCED 



RYE BREAD, CUT THICK AND WELL 

BUTTERED 
SALT AND PEPPER 
PARSLEY, CRESS OR WATER CRESS, MINCED 



Scrape the best bit of round or tenderloin you can get, to free it 
from all sinew. Don't chop it or run it through a grinder, but scrape 
it carefully with the point of a tablespoon. Season well with salt 
and pepper and add a squeeze of lemon if you like. Spread thickly 
on buttered rye and pile the minced onion and parsley in little 
heaps hard by, for mixing into the meat according to taste or taking 
alternate bites of these indispensable relishes. 

This red-faced, open-faced, raw meat sandwich is made attrac- 
tive by cross-hatching the top with the back of a knife blade or 
otherwise dappling it into a decorative pattern, as a butler would 
fix up a pat of butter fancy enough for a DuPont, or a stableboy 
would curry the flanks of Mrs. Astor*s horse. 

A pleasing addition is an egg yolk, either stirred into the meat 
to make it juicier, or perched whole on top of it, like a jockey, for 
the eater to mix in to suit himself. 

Since all professional cooks at some time or another sicken at the 
sight of any cooked dish, just as candy-makers choke on candy. 
Cannibal Sandwiches are a godsend to them. They'll turn down 

132 



SANDWICHES THAT SATISFY I33 

fancy food frills a la financiere and go for the uncooked Ham- 
burgers. For that's exactly what these are; and there's nothing 
simpler or easier to digest in the way of meat. 

HEARTH-BREAD SPREADS 

The best white sandwich bread we know is the wholesome, 
well-knit Italian loaf, sold cheaper than ordinary cottony white 
bread in any "Little Italy.** It's the type known as "hearth" 
bread, very solid and crusty, has more weight to it, is better baked 
and guaranteed to stick to your ribs. For a pleasant change butter 
it with olive oil, or the olive oil from a can of sardines, anchovies or 
antipasto, but make sure it's not cottonseed oil. And for many peo- 
ple chicken fat is much finer than the best butter you can buy. The 
oil from honestly made peanut butter or plain peanut oil also 
makes a snappy spread. 

A sandwich that's a well-balanced meal in itself is: 

CHEESE AND GARLIC 

Buy some good old Wisconsin cheese. It costs 20% more than 
the green, rubbery store cheese, but then, it's lost at least that 
much water in standing several years, so you're getting probably 
more cheese for your money and the flavor, of course, is incom- 
parable. Peel all the cloves of three or four heads of good garlic, 
the younger and fresher the better, and fry them in a very little 
olive oil until they're soft and gelatinous. Push them to one side of 
the pan to keep warm while you melt a couple of good slices of your 
old cheese in the pan and when it's bubbling and creamy pour ev- 
erything, garlic, cheese and oil over a big thick slab of hearth bread. 
Butter, of course, is unnecessary with this rich miniature meal. 

POOR BOY SANDWICH 

In spite of its partonizing name this is a good handout. It's a 
New Orleans specialty that has now spread to barbecue stands all 
over the South. Just get yourself a long, narrow "flute" of French 
bread, slice it lengthwise and fill it with an assortment of three or 
four different things, in sections that can be cut off separately, a 
hot dog with sauerkraut fills one-third, a fried egg the next and 



134 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

perhaps a luscious slab of liver and bacon completes this three 
course meal. You can vary the fillings, with whatever you've got 
on hand, and there's nothing that fills the lunch box quite so 
handily, but it must be a long lunch box, more like a piccolo case. 

UNUSUAL SANDWICHES 

During the revolution in Mexico we ate cactus sandwiches and 
liked them — because there wasn't anything else. In France, we 
had horsemeat sandwiches which likewise came into fashion 
through war, but the flesh was a little too sweet, although we were 
assured that the plug was from our own middle west which supplies 
much of the horsemeat that Europe eats because it's cheap, 
tasty, and as nourishing as beef. But we ioo%-ers won't eat any 
animal we can pet — and that goes for goat, which makes the most 
popular sandwich in all Mexico. Along the Mex-Tex border tamales 
and enchilladas wrapped in crisp tortillas take the place of sand- 
wiches and we learned to dress a hot dog Panhandle style by split- 
ting it open and pouring red hot chili the full length, to make a real 
smoldering Chile Con Carne Sandwich. 

In Chinatown you can get a Smoked Duck Sandwich with am- 
brosial "duck sauce," or make a Bean Sprout and Soy Sandwich 
at home by covering the bread with crisp bean sprouts (the fresh 
are better than the canned, and cheaper) sprinkled with soy sauce. 

STINGER SANDWICHES 

Plain German style mustard, just spread fairly thick on bread 
makes a peppy open-faced sandwich, and the same holds good for 
pickled horseradish, catsup, chili sauce or any mixture of these 
stingaree spreads, on thick, juicy, black or rye bread — of course, 
with or without butter and a cooling lettuce leaf. Beer is the best 
accompanying cooling agent. 

RED CAVIAR CANAPES 

One of the cheapest imported delicacies we know is the red sal- 
mon caviar that's sold in foreign sections for less per pound than 
butter. Stamp out some rounds of pumpernickel with the top of a 
can and just roll the big red fish pearls on, using a wooden spoon. 



SANDWICHES THAT SATISFY 135 

to avoid crushing them. Some spread the bread with butter, but 
we Hke it plain, in Soviet style, for the caviar is rich enough. Pressed 
caviar is the cheapest of the black sturgeon kind, but it hasn't the 
juicy snap of the bargain-priced red. 

BARBECUED BULLFROG SANDWICH 

Parboil fresh froglegs 20 minutes (or use cooked canned frog meat 
without parboiling), then broil over hot coals, basting with a little 
butter. Shred the meat, clap it between hot buttered sides of a bun 
and sluice with a good barbecue sauce, plenty hot with Tabasco 
and garlic. 

CURRIED GAME SANDWICH 

Use any chopped, cooked game such as rabbit or prairie chicken, 
the quantity of it doubled, if necessary, by adding an equal amount 
of chopped veal. Use 1 parts of game, or game and tame, combined 
with a little ham and 2 or 3 anchovies. Run through grinder, season 
well with hot curry, heat in butter with a little lemon juice or 
vinegar. Spread thick on buttered toast and grate hard cheese over. 

Pulverized dill flowers might take the place of the powdered 
cheese. This is an expensive sandwich unless you shoot your own 
game, although rabbit is cheap in its season. 

MOUNTAIN OYSTER SANDWICHES

Skin, wash and parboil the fries, drain, slit lengthwise into two

lemon juice, nutmeg and Tabasco. 

English Aristocrat Style: The English call mountain oysters 
"lamb's stones'* or, more modestly, "lamb's secrets." They roll 
them in flour, with an equal number of sea oysters and pieces of 
sweetbreads frying the sweetbreads and secrets first and adding 
oysters when half done. After putting them to bed on buttered 



136 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

toast, they cover the secrets and everything with a highly-seasoned 
sauce of asparagus tips, chopped chives, sherry, egg, nutmeg and 
meat gravy, to make a costly sandwich that's got nothing on our 
Western: 

SHEEPHERDER'S MOUNTAIN OYSTER 

At gelding time, on the western range, shcepherders carry 
along sourdough, bacon and seasonings. They make biscuits, broil 
baconj throw the mountain oysters whole into the campfire and 
roast them like potatoes. When done, they dust off the ashes, clap 
the meat between bacon dripping sourdough biscuits and drench 
with pepper sauce and catsup. 

Lamb fries have no waste and are great value in meat, for usu- 
ally they're sold cheap because the squeamish are afraid to buy 
them or to ask the butcher, "Otto, how are your lamb fries today?" 

This sheepherder's special might be called an occupational sand- 
wich and among others peculiar to their craft are: 

EPSOM DOWNS' BOOKMAKER'S SPECIAL 

A chopped mixed grill of meats and giblets such as liver, heart, 
and kidneys, with plenty of mustard, between slabs of bread. This 
has been the classic snack of British bookies ever since the Epsom 
Downs track was laid, for they, like workers in more honest and 
creative jobs, have to have something substantial to munch on 
without taking time off for a sit-down meal. 

LINOTYPER'S LEADEN BULLETS 

In South America, where linotypes and monotypes haven't been 
in common use long enough for operators to really fear lead- 
poisoning, the molten metal box is often used as a sandwich heater 
until the operator is suddenly stricken with strange shooting pains 
and is carted off to hospital or cemetery. 

"MAGGIE AND JIGGS" SANDWICH 

"Spread white bread with horseradish butter and cover with 
thinly sliced corned beef, top with slice of brown bread and a lettuce 
leaf. Serve with a side of hot buttered cabbage." 



SANDWICHES THAT SATISFY I37 

This good Irish number is quoted from a workmanlike cookbook 
called Salads and Sandwiches by Emory Hawcock, who runs Haw- 
cock's Cafe in Monmouth, Illinois. 

And another from the same excellent MidWest source book is: 

"HOG IN THE WHEAT" SANDWICH 

Pat a thin casing of biscuit dough around franks, weenies, or any 
link sausages, brush with egg wash and bake. For link sausages, 
serve on lettuce with a paper cup of chutney or chili sauce; the 
frankfurter itself barks for chow chow or mustard. 

And this sealed sandwich is only an Americanization of 

RUSSIAN PIROSHKIS 

Fine biscuit dough for making rolls is stuffed with forcemeat, 
caviar, chopped eggs, all different sorts of piquant fillings, and the 
rolls baked as usual. When you eat them hot you're always pleas- 
antly surprised with the cooked-in savory stuffings. They're like 
gigantic raviolis.

Damn that 

Delicatessen 

Habit! 



^^m 



At the beginning of this century delicatessen stores were so new 
and exciting to this country that the imported word was used 
playfully by our native elite: "Would that be the delicatessen 
thing to do?" ** Let's go delicatessening" — like our present Eng- 
lish importation ** Let's go pub-crawling." Delicatessens then were 
smart city shops which supplied Westphalian hams, the raw sau- 
sage of Aries, anchovies chasing their tails in olive oil, caviar and 
such, all the juicy black breads and spicy black puddings that our 
leisure class had learned to love on trips abroad. Although some of 
these foreign specialties were plebeian enough abroad, they were 
much too good for the common people here after duty had been 
paid. 

We remember Percivars French delicatessen on Sixth Avenue 
just above Eighth Street, in New York, where Ugobono's is now. 
And the only way we could beat Percival's price for imported 

138 



DAMN THAT DELICATESSEN HABIT ! I39 

camembert was when he had too many cheeses ripening all at once 
— he was the original importer of the excellent Torre Eifel Brand 
and shipped it to delicatessens all over the U. S. Then he had to 
sell them out three for a quarter, nice, round, ripe wooden boxes 
velvety with the cream of cheeses that we've never been able to 
imitate. But look at the thing now! The delicatessens are full of 
sloppy American-made atrocities that sell in bad condition for as 
much as the genuine camembert used to bring. And American 
Roquefort should be a national scandal. The women's magazines 
taught us that Roquefort was the smart thing, especially when 
mashed with butter for a spread, and the original imported wasn't 
so bad, but now it looks as though the French are sending us chips 
off the chalk cliffs of Dover and we're actually paying as high as 
^2.00 a pound for the stuff when we buy it in ten and fifteen cent 
doses at the delicatessen. And not only that, but an incredibly 
bad domestic imitation is palmed off by delicatessen dealers 
who know their public will stand for anything — even processed 
cheeses. 

The delicatessen habit has grown upon us so subtly that many 
weary laborers returning home on payday, too worn-out to think 
of cooking, stop in at the nearest delicatessen and blow a day or 
two's pay for bologna that's got less meat than a gnawed drumstick 
and is likely to blow up the stomach like a balloon; on synthetic 
liverwurst, too, that goes green even in the icebox and is apt to 
cost a visit to the doctor; on processed cheese pastes that resemble 
cheese about as much as Big Bill Thompson resembled King 
George, and half a dozen bottles of beer with halitosis caused by 
its greenness and the rice its made of instead of slower maturing 
grain, and sold at a fixed price of 3 for two-bits plus deposits on 
bottles we've been taught it's almost shameful to return. 

So, many hurried city workers are as much in the clutch of the 
delicatessen habit as they are in the hands of the druggist who sells 
them a lousy ham sandwich for 15^ at noon, with just a trace of 
ham paste blown on, and then a watery drink for a dime. Our 
human need for lunching has been turned into a swell way to 
produce drug-chain dividends out of foodless food, but with the 
small independent delicatessen keeper it's different, for he's as 



140 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

much in the grabbing hands of the makers of fake foods as we are 
in his. 

True, there are some fine American products for his store, ex- 
cellent Cincinnati sausage and Milwaukee liverwurst that can 
compare with the imported original, but in order to live at all, the 
delicatessen man usually has to sell bad fakes. If you pin him down 
as to the origin of that sausage called "Cincinnati" in the trade 
and sold for 49^ a pound solely on the honest reputation it has 
earned in Ohio, he'll have to admit that his is made in some local 
slum slaughterhouse in New York, Chicago, almost anywhere, out 
of whatever's left over, plus a whole lot of cornmeal mush or maybe 
sawdust, and has never been within 500 miles of its supposed 
original habitat in Cincinnati. 

Delicatessens have become the kind of necessary luxury we can't 
live with, yet can't live without. So all we can suggest is to pass up 
the 100% American ones and find some honest dealer who still 
handles imported goods or the best substitutes made by compatri- 
ots in America, including, of course, all the really good maple sugar, 
succotash and all-American products. Such a store is a convenience 
and is most often found in a foreign workers' quarter; in an Italian 
one you can get fresh-baked hearth breads that your teeth sink into 
with a contented sigh, spicy hot homemade sausage, bulk ancho- 
vies, swell cheeses, Mortadello, all sorts of succulent things im- 
ported in big barrels and tins and sold in most cases for less than 
the standardized wooden-nutmeg imitation. In a Greek delicatessen 
you can buy calamatas, those slender, long olives that taste better 
than any others we know, for as little as 35^ a pound, and a virgin 
olive oil which comes out as cheap or cheaper than butter, if you 
get a gallon can. There are even imported grapevine leaves for 
wrapping around meat melanges to give that sapid oriental savor 
and for a nickel you can buy enough of them to liven up several 
meals, or you can pick and pickle them yourself if the right kind 
grows in your neighborhood, for this wrapping leaf must be bluish 
on the underside. A real Danish pastry shop is a gold mine com- 
pared to a typical bakery chain and a freshly stuffed dill pickle is 
something, when you get it made in true Austrian style; the stores 
of Chinatown sell smoked pork and duck, honest noodles, soy 



DAMN THAT DELICATESSEN HABIt! I4I 

sauce, bean sprouts and superior foods which you can't match for 
twice the money in one of those typical snack shops that keep 
alive by staying open to catch you when you come home at mid- 
night with a big appetite and maybe a little overtime pay to blow 
on bologna, beer, and biscuits, getting the resultant bellyache and 
hangover absolutely free.

Rabbit Food 




FOR VITAMINS AND BODY-BUILDING MINERALS 

Immigrant truck farmers, especially Italians, have enriched our 
fresh vegetable scope enormously with such things as anise, arti- 
chokes, spaghetti, squash and broccoli. And the Chinese have given 
us bean sprouts, easy to grow in a big flat pan in the kitchen, and 
Chinese cabbage. Such domesticated importations, added to our 
own indigenous potatoes, tomatoes, and pumpkins, grown from 
coast to coast and climate to climate give us a swell assortment at 
what should be fair prices the year around. In any case there's al- 
ways something in season produced and shipped in quantities big 
enough to make a good buy, if the price isn't held too high by mar- 
ket racketeers and middlemen. 

When we had a room down near the market in New Orleans we 
never paid anything for either ice or head lettuce because the 
Negro boy who did odd jobs for us used to pick both up free around 
the cars loading up for the North. For Louisiana lettuce in season 
is almost worthless, except by the crate. Likewise our market boy 
brought us bananas from the fruit docks, where the ripe ones are 
cut out of the green bunches and thrown away, since one ripe 
banana will spoil a whole green bunch, just as a rotten apple will 
ruin the entire barrel. Although this is off the subject, it was in our 
New Orleans Creole-quarter room where we first tasted the chit- 
terlings of kid as prepared by the Italians downstairs, and these 

142 



RABBIT FOOD 1 43 



were much more delicate and nicer in fragrance and taste than calf 
chitterlings. Likewise we supped absolutely free on luscious oyster 
crabs for which millionaires have to pay I5.00 a quart. These were 
smuggled out and brought home by underpaid oyster openers who 
lived in the next room. 

But to get back to vegetables: buy in big city markets and direct 
from the truckers if you can. In wholesale auctions of food-stuffs 
two sets of books are sometimes kept, and the one jeeringly called 
"The Farmer's Book" shows prices paid to him that often are be- 
low the cost of production. In retail markets, the best bargains are 
late Saturday night or before holidays when perishable foods can't 
be kept over; not that we wish the marketmen any bad luck or ex- 
pect that everybody will wait till the last minute for the price to 
come down, but just to point out that since most of us have got to 
buy cheap or starve, the time and place for marketing must be care- 
fully considered. The early bird gets the pick of the market, but 
has to pay a high price for it. Likewise, usually it's foolish to make 
journeys into the country to buy from farm stands, since nowadays 
most of these are supplied from the city wholesale market and you 
pay the middleman's profit just the same. But the best way to buy 
at a fair price is to organize and boycott, as east-side Jewish women 
fight the rising cost of kosher meat and the middle class New York 
League of Women Shoppers pickets with market bags tacked on 
poles to convince dealers that they'd better exert pressure on the 
middleman and get that profit down or be forced out of business. 

Also, to get your money's worth it's necessary to know how to 
judge quality, so here are some hints on picking out prime vege- 
tables. 

Anise, or Finocchio. The sweet anise, called Florence Fennel, 
or Finocchio, in Italian, is a large blanched bulb of fine flavor, 
something like licorice. The best type is big, crisp and tender, 
known in Italian markets as "Mother Anise." You seldom get a 
bad one. The chief thing to look out for is withered outside leaves 
or too spindly a shape, which shows that the seed core has begun to 
develop. The bulb should be compact like celery and the top spray 
of leaves fresh and dark green in color. It's best eaten raw; try cut- 
ting one in eighths and dressing it with olive oil, lemon juke or vine- 



144 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

gar, beaten together with salt and freshly ground pepper and then 
pepped up with a palmful of poppyseeds heated crisp as popcorn in 
a frying pan. We perfected this salad by adding the poppyseeds 
and are mighty proud of it. 

Anise can be roasted or boiled, but the Italians, with whom it's 
an enduring favorite, prefer it raw, and so do we. 

Artichokes. Pick out firm, compact heads of plump globe shape. 
When they're getting old, tough and tasteless the leaves turn brown- 
ish, wither, begin to loosen and stand out from the head. The bot- 
tom is the meatiest part, but there's a tasty little bite at the base of 
each leaf. In season, artichokes, most of which are shipped from 
California, are a good buy and make a nice change from the usual 
run of vegetables. They can be stuffed in all sorts of ways but we 
hke them best plain boiled and dipped leaf by leaf into a saucer of 
melted butter or olive oil with lemon juice or red wine vinegar, salt 
and plenty of fresh-ground pepper. Small, or baby artichokes are 
the last that grow and Italians preserve them. In 1936 the Mayor 
of New York City smashed a market racket which had forced up 
the cost of these tiny ones to even more than that of the big 
globes. 

Jerusalem Artichokes. These knobby little fellows are not at 
all like their big leafy brothers. How they ever came to be called 
"artichoke" we can't imagine, for Jerusalems are just the root of 
the old American sunflower, or girasol, which sounds like Jerusa- 
lem. They're cooked like potatoes, but are harder to pare on ac- 
count of their irregular shape. They must be smooth of skin, firm, 
even in color, and dry, for damp, flabby ones will be soggy and 
watery when cooked. 

Asparagus. As with wild strawberries, small wild asparagus is 
tastier than tame, but it's hard to come by commercially, so this 
serves only to illustrate the fact that you don't have to buy the 
biggest California stalks of asparagus; you'll get better value out of 
the small uneven-sized ones grown closer to home and sold by 
weight at half the big bunched rate. And this small green asparagus 
should be done pioneer style, cut up small and creamed in plenty 
of milk. Of the two colors of asparagus, green and blanched white, 
the green is by far the tastier, and the only good canned asparagus 



RABBIT FOOD I45 



we know consists of the green tips only — although the obese whole 
white stalks cost more, because of the waste. 

The less there is of woody stalk, the better. The U. S. Depart- 
ment of Agriculture says ** green asparagus should be green for al- 
most its entire length" and adds that the blanched kind **is said 
to be somewhat milder in flavor." "Said to be" is right — it's of- 
ten so mild you can't even taste it! 

All asparagus must be fresh, with heads compact, and stalks un- 
wilted. 

Beans. Some marketers who know their onions don't know beans. 
But "snap" is the other name for "string" or fresh green beans, 
and that's all the clue we need. Whether green, yellow or wax, 
they've got to be as full of snap as a cranberry and as nearly string- 
less as possible. The way to test that is to break one in half — if it 
pops and exudes juice, buy it, but if it bends and is held together by 
too woody a string, leave it for Mrs. Astor's butler. 

Beans, Dried. The only thing we know against the common 
dried navy beans is that sometimes they're adulterated with peb- 
bles, which are hard on the teeth, so a mess of beans should be 
looked over carefully, and since they come in all colors, try black, 
red, blue or spotted beans for a change. Some Southern varieties 
are swell, like whippoorwills or "lady peas," for Southerners can't 
really tell the difference between peas and beans, and that's all to 
the good — if you're buying beans. 

Beans, Lima. The two common kinds are tiny limas, called but- 
ter beans, and the big ones known in the trade as the "potato 
type." Both are excellent when tender, and as they're usually sold 
shelled it's easy to tell whether or not the skins are fresh by prick- 
ing one with the fingernail. If it pops open it's okay, but if your nail 
only leaves a dent, that means the bean is old, tough and tasteless. 

Bean Sprouts. Spread navy beans on any absorbent piece of 
cloth in a big flat pan, keep in a warm spot, covered with water and 
another cloth until the sprouts shoot up. These make a succulent, 
crunchy salad, or cook them in the juice from a can of pineapple, 
to give the real oriental tang to chop suey and many another fine 
.Chinatown dish. 

Bean sprouts are cheap as beans, so anybody who likes some- 



146 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

thing snappy, fresh, and full of vitamins can have it on hand all 
winter long. We've mentioned this in other places, but since no- 
body reads a cook book clear through, from "civer to civer," it'll 
bear repeating. 

Beets. Early beets are sold whole with their top leaves on, and 
be sure to get them that way, for these beet greens are so much in 
demand they're sold separately, too, though usually they're the 
kind the farmer thins from the rows, but sometimes they're cut off 
bunched new beets by market racketeers. Late summer beets are 
sold without their tops, which usually are too dry to make a decent 
mess of greens. And don't wash off the earth that clings to these 
because the best way to get the full beet flavor is to wrap it whole 
in paper, earth and all, bake in the oven and when done, remove the 
earth with the outer skin. And for boiling, beets must never be 
cut, except for borscht, or the red runs out and the beet gets pallid 
and unpalatable. In European markets and in some foreign sec- 
tions here they're called *'beet root" and sold already boiled, which 
saves the cost of the long cooking they require. 

Broccoli. Freshness and tenderness are the essentials. The 
flowers may be closed or open but must not be wilted or spotted, 
because there'll be too much waste. 

Brussels Sprouts. These miniature cabbage heads should be 
compact and bright green in color. 

Cabbage. Heavy, compact heads are best and since there are 
several varieties, including the red and the light green savoy, as 
well as the pointed and Danish, it's a good idea to use them all in 
rotation, to vary the menu. Cabbages are graded by the number of 
outside leaves showing, the fewer the better. Small new cabbages 
are best boiled whole for 15-20 minutes, then split and buttered at 
the table. Don't cook them too long, if you want to enjoy their 
sprightly flavor. 

Chinese Cabbage. Long, cylindrical, crisp — fine as lettuce, for 
salad. Of course you can cook them, but they're lots tastier raw. 

Carrots. As with beets, new Spring carrots are sold with their 
tops on and when these tops are young and tender they are good, 
chopped like parsley, in salad or to garnish meat dishes. As a matter 
of fact, carrots and parsley belong to the same family. Young car- 



RABBIT FOOD I47 



rots wilt quickly and shrivel down to nothing; so they should be 
bought fresh and bright in color and used within a day or two — 
the sooner, the tastier. 

Cauliflower. The creamy- white head is picturesquely called 
"curd" which it resembles. It must be clean and compact, for, as 
with broccoli, loose and spotted heads are too wasteful. 

Celery. Good celery has crispness and snap. It shouldn't be 
either small and runty or overgrown, for then the heart may be 
starting to go to seed. Everything pertaining to a bunch of celery 
should be used, except the string; the tougher outside and tops of 
stalks are fine for soups and the leaves when dried make as good 
seasoning as you can buy. And so do the roots, which usually are 
pared down too close, but always worth drying and powdering. 

Celeriac. This big celery root is a good buy and usually appears 
in the market in sound, acceptable condition. 

Chard, Swiss Chard. Should be as fresh and snappy as celery 
and the leaves not holed by bugs. There is no waste to chard and 
it's one of the most dependable vegetables we know. It should be 
cheap, because it grows like grass. The contrast between meaty 
white stalk and soft juicy greens makes an appetizing dish. 

Chicory, Endive, Romaine and Escarole. Crispness is the 
test for these fine salad plants brought to us by immigrants. They 
make an appetizing change from ordinary garden or head lettuce. 

CoLLARDS. This makes a good mess of greens with salt pork or 
corned beef. As with all greens, unwilted crispness is essential. 
Although collards are a kind of kale, they taste like cabbage, but 
not like "skunk cabbage" which is sometimes called collards, too. 

Corn. Sweet corn for biting right off the ear is chiefly divided into 
the yellow kinds, usually known as Golden Bantam, and the whites 
such as Country Gentleman. They should never be bought sight- 
unseen. The dealer should pull back the husk of each ear to show 
that there are no worms, and the kernels should be tested with the 
thumb-nail to make sure they are plumped out with milk. When 
corn is too young the kernels are too small and tasteless and when 
too old they're so tough only horses can chew them. Look out for 
big "field" or "horse" corn often dumped for "sweet" or "sugar" 
corn at the end of the season. 



148 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

Cress. All cresses, garden, water and highland are fine peppery 
herbs when fresh, crisp and a good green in color. Swell in salads 
and for garnishing meat. They cost next to nothing. 

Cucumbers. Firm, fresh and bright in color, never yellowish or 
puffy. 

Dandelion Greens. The wild kind is stronger in taste, and 
likely to be tough, unless picked very young and always, of course, 
before blossoming. The cultivated kind is lighter in color from 
blanching, larger, more tender, and milder in taste, yet most 
eaters of the dandelion prefer the tangy call of the wild. 

Eggplant. Deep royal purple is the color and an eggplant must 
be heavy and elastically firm. 

Garlic. The fresh crop, or "new" garlic, is by far the richest in 
flavor. In Europe, the day that new garlic comes in is often cele- 
brated by drinking, feasting, and dancing in the streets. As with 
onions, when garlic gets old it begins to sprout and lose its firmness 
and flavor, from too much preoccupation with reproducing itself. 

Greens. There are all sorts of greens the year around, their va- 
riety depending on the locality: beet tops, broccoli, chard, chicory, 
collards, cress, dandelions, endive, escarole, kale, mustard, sorrel 
(sour grass), spinach, turnip tops, etc. These are judged by crisp- 
ness, strong color and general vitality. 

Kale. This cheapest of greens is also the coarsest. Its quality is 
judged just the same as the others — it must be clean, fresh and 
dark bluish-green in color. 

Kohlrabi. This delicate cabbage whose roots grow above ground 
shouldn't be neglected — it's inexpensive and makes a fine dish 
when firm, young and tender. Its youth can be told by the velvety 
feel of its skin. 

Lettuce. The two head lettuces are named after Boston and New 
York, the Boston kind is also called ** butter-head" and has 
smoother, greener leaves than the New York ''crisp-head," which 
is larger, firmer and crisper, and sometimes wrongly called "Ice- 
berg." The third kind is leaf or garden lettuce which doesn't head, is 
more delicate and wilts quickly, and the fourth is romaine or cos 
lettuce, the head being as long and cylindrical as a cucumber, with 
tougher leaves and stronger flavor. All lettuce has to be fresh, firm 
and lively in color. Beware of old lettuce in which the seed stalk 



RABBIT FOOD I 49 



has begun to separate the leaves at the base. It's bitter. You can 
feel the top of the hard seed core by gently pressing the top and 
sides of any kind of lettuce. 

Mushrooms. "Button" mushrooms sell at a higher price than 
those with their umbrellas open, but are not necessarily as good a 
buy. We like mature mushrooms with well-developed spores that 
make a tastier sauce. 

Okra. Pods must be young, tender and as full of snap as snap 
beans. 

Onions. Dry onions come in many colors: white, yellow, brown, 
red and purple, and in all degrees of flavor. They must be plump, 
shapely, hard and bright-skinned. Unshapely onions may have be- 
gun to split or sprout and are therefore wasteful and not as tasty. 
There are the big Bermudas that taste as sweet as apples; Spanish 
or Valencia, and American kinds that are smaller but much stronger. 

Green Onion Family. Leeks, shallots, chives, scallions and 
Spring onions must all be green to the top and bursting with juice. 
The bulb onion from seed is better in taste and value than any 
kind of sprouts or scallions. Chives bought growing in a pot, for a 
dime or so, are handy fresh garnishing to keep in the kitchen. 

Parsley. The flat-leafed Italian kind is fullest of flavor; the 
curled leaf may be prettier, but it's not so tasty. But a third kind 
called Hamburg is the best buy because it has a big root that's 
fine in soups and as flavorsome as celery root, although it belongs 
to the carrot family. The tops serve as any other parsley for gar- 
nishing. Color and crispness is the test. Yellow, wilted parsley is a 
bad buy. 

Parsnips. Good only in winter and best when left in the ground 
until spring. Small, firm, smooth and shapely parsnips are the ones 
worth taking home. Overgrown ones are likely to be woody or 
pithy and hence useless. 

Peas. The younger the better. Like beans, they must have snap 
and juice in their pods and the peas tender but well developed. 
Bright "pea" green is the right color and, as with most vegetables, 
any sign of yellow indicates approaching old age and hardened 
arteries. To get the full flavor, peas should be steamed in French 
farmer style with little or no water and covered with lettuce leaves 
to hold the steam down. 



150 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

Peas, Dried. The finest we know are Southern "lady peas," but 
try to get them in Northern markets! 

Peppers. The two commonest kinds are the large, bell-shaped 
sweet Spanish pepper or pimiento and the hotter, smaller cayenne 
and chili peppers. (The dictionary spells this "chile" but along the 
Mexican Border it's "chili" and we think this comes closer to the 
original.) All are picked mature but while still green in color, for 
shipping; they become red as they ripen. They must have smooth, 
bright skins and be plump and elastic to the touch. Discolored 
spots indicate approaching decay. Sometimes the whole plant of 
small peppers is pulled and that makes a fine interior decoration 
for the kitchen. We bought one off a pushcart for 15^ and it served 
both for seasoning and beauty for half a year. 

Poke Salad. This common weed when picked young is as tasty 
as asparagus, which it resembles in appearance. 

Potatoes. The only way to make sure that any lot of potatoes is 
good all the way through is to cut one in half, and any dealer should 
be willing to do this to prove there's no hollow or black ring under 
the skin, which last indicates freezing. The best buy is smooth and 
well-shaped with shallow eyes because deep eyes are wasteful; and 
the color should be even without any green showing, for such 
"sunburned" potatoes are bitter. Care should be taken in paring 
thin, for sometimes a quarter of the food is thrown away with the 
skin. In fact, sailors and other amateur potato-peelers sometimes 
waste even more than goes into the kettle, so the most economical 
way to cook potatoes is always with their jackets on, unless you're 
going to slice them for drying or scalloping. 

Sweet Potatoes. Should be bright, firm, smooth, shapely and 
dry. They rot easier than murphies, and should never get damp or 
wet. 

Radishes. Always press one of the biggest radishes in a bunch 
to make sure it isn't pithy. There's no need to stick to the white 
icicles or the little red kind, there's the long black Spanish and the 
big white German kind, especially for winter. 

Rhubarb. Stalks should be tender and snappy with juice and 
well colored, either light pink or dark red, for rich color usually indi- 
cates fine flavor. The younger the better, and never old and wilted. 



RABBIT FOOD I5I 



RoMAiNE. See lettuce. 

Rutabagas. See turnips. 

Salsify, or Oyster Plant. This is the same tan color as par- 
snip, but smaller around, and of a different flavor. Like parsnip, 
the smoother and more shapely, the less waste, and its flavor is 
also improved if it's left in the ground until freezing weather. 

Spinach. Must be bright and snappy. Beware of soft, wilted or 
yellowed leaves. 

Squash. There are so many kinds, winter, summer, green, yel- 
low, round and flat, that all we can suggest is they should be hefty 
for their size. We get the biggest kick out of three kinds, all of them 
fairly new in the markets but growing fast in popularity, and we'd 
even be willing to pay the price of popularity if these now-cheap 
nutmeg, cocozelli and spaghetti squashes went up, for we figure 
that anything which gives such keen enjoyment helps us get the 
most for our squash dollar. 

Tomatoes. Now bred to convenient size to suit the shipper, not 
the consumer. The big old-fashioned ''beefsteak" tomato is best in 
flavor — but try and get it! As for the commercial kind, the heavier 
and healthier in color, the better; although underripe ones will get 
red on the window-sill, they won't be as full of flavor. Overripe ones 
are only good for kids to throw at cops when they're being shagged. 

Turnips. As with beets, the early ones come with tops attached 
and these crisp leaves make a swell dish of greens, especially when 
cooked in the broth of salt pork. Smooth, firm turnips are a better 
buy than old ones that have stayed in the ground until they've 
become as pithy as punk radishes. 

Rutabagas, called Swedes, from the popularity of this giant 
turnip among the Swedes who brought it to this country, were 
formerly thought fit only for cattle, but now they prove to be about 
the best buy in the whole turnip family. In any case, they offer 
most for your turnip money. 

Watercress. This luscious cress, when crisp and fresh, is one 
of the best buys we know. It's fine dunked in mayonnaise a spray 
at a time, also for pepping up a salad or garnishing a meat dish. 
It's chockful of vitamins and body-building minerals and those 
people who munch it like rabbits are all the better off.

Peel artichokes, then wash them well, because they have a very 
earthy taste. Cook in 2 quarts water with sliced onions, salt and 
butter. 

Separately, make mashed potatoes, cream sauce, and boil the Brus- 
sels sprouts. When artichokes and sprouts are tender spread a thick 
circle of mashed potatoes around the outside of a big dinner plate 
or round platter and stick the artichokes in, leaving spaces between. 
Cover with cream sauce or melted butter and then stick a Brussels 
sprout between each pair of artichokes and heap the rest in the mid- 
dle, to make a dish "exceedingly inviting, simple and pretty." 

The last words are those of the internationally famous chef 
Soyer, who invented this dish to please royal patrons in Queen Vic- 
toria's reign. Soyer's dishes were a great gift to the gouty and many 
of them, like the above, are cheap and satisfying to those who like 
to make a whole meal out of one hearty vegetable dish, especially 
in summer time. 

This dish takes a bit of doing, as the English say, but it's well 
worth it, for the contrasting flavors are pleasing to both eye and 
tummy. 

In season, both artichokes and Brussels sprouts are cheap.

Jerusalem artichokes, in fact, cost no more than potatoes and make 
an acceptable change. The chief trouble with them is that they are 
so irregular in shape they take patience to peel, but lots of us have 
more time than money. Although these tubers were planted by 
American Indians and introduced from here throughout the world, 
they have never had the appreciation they deserve in their home- 
land. Maybe because they're only the tubers of our indigenous 
American sunflower.

While the lentils are cheap, the butter and eggs raise the price of 
this dish. Yet it is substantial enough to take the place of meat and 
many people find the flavor of lentils as savory as people did in 
biblical days, when lentils generally took the place of beans.

Boil beans 25 minutes in salted water. Boil green ears of corn 
10-20 minutes depending on age. Cut corn from cob, not too close 
to cob or it will be bitter. Drain most of the water from beans, add 
corn, with butter, salt, a little pepper and heat to just below boiling 
point. 



154 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

This is the original American Indian dish, but it has sadly slipped, 
with navy beans, even string beans, substituted for the limas and 
sometimes canned corn in place of kernels cut fresh from the cob. 
Since corn is our greatest indigenous food, when it is mixed with the 
flat bean of tropical America it has an appeal to the native palate 
unequalled by anything short of turkey and cranberry sauce.

This is another natural. Next to succotash our native tongue 
wraps rapturously around these most succulent of vegetable oys- 
ters. 

CORN OIL 

The Turk's national food is beans, the Chinaman's is rice, and 
ours is corn. Out of beans the orientals make soy sauce (the base of 
Worcestershire) just as the French, Italian and Spanish people use 
their olives to make salad and cooking oil. They eat up large crops 
of peanuts too, mostly expressed into oil which suits the national 
taste and is the piquant flavor we recognize in "French Fried 
Potatoes" cooked on the other side. Walnut oil is another French 
favorite. 

There are scores of flavorsome oils, such as extracts of sesame 
and sunflower seed used in the Near East and cocoanut oils in the 
West Indies; cotton seed oils all over the world, called ''Sarashime" 
in Japan, and less romantic names here at home. 

Our national contribution is the oil of corn; a common brand of 
it is called Mazola, from the old Indian word "maize." Corn oil 
suits our taste, the same as succotash does, for it is indigenous to 
our land. Succotash (also an American Indian name) is just our 



EAT YOUR spinach! 1 55 

dish, and besides it's on the alkaline side. So instead of a treatment 
by Alka-Seltzer, try this — it's cheaper and better in every way:

Mix all ingredients and serve ice cold on lettuce leaves. 

The corn flavor is in the oil and this is just a suggestion of pos- 
sible uses of a tasty food lubricant which can enrich not only cold 
salads but hot vegetable dishes such as zuccini, fish dishes, en- 
trees, meats, and of course desserts. We give the trade name 
Mazola because it's the only corn oil we know. Here's hoping there 
are others; better and cheaper. 

SUMMER SALAD 

LEAF LETTUCE LEMON JUICE, OR VINEGAR 

POWDERED SUGAR 

Use the garden lettuce which comes in loose leaves rather than in 
compact heads, wash well in cold water, shake off some of the 
water, serve with quartered lemon and powdered sugar, for each 
person to dress his lettuce as he likes. 

This sour-sweet salad is specially suited to the summer season 
when heavy, oily dressings are too heating. It was the favorite of 
pioneers, who used vinegar in place of lemon, of course, and 
powdered their own sugar from the big cones and lumps in which 
it was sold. Powdered sugar is essential in this dish, granulated 
sugar is too hard and gritty, since in this dish there's little liquid 
to dissolve it. 

Because head lettuce is in demand and brings a high price the 
year round, it is good to know that plain garden lettuce, sold very 
cheaply in the summer markets, will make a fine tasting salad that 
needn't cost more than a cent a plate.

Fry bacon golden brown and remove from pan, keeping It warm. 

To the bacon fat add all seasonings and when boiling pour over 
lettuce in another cooking pan. Cover this, let steam 5 minutes, 
sprinkle fried bacon over and serve piping hot. 

This inexpensive, homey dish is licking good. It can be made in 
summer of the common garden lettuce that's much cheaper than 
the Boston kind raised for commerce. 

BEAN SPROUTS 

Bean sprouts are a great oriental gift to our cuisine. You can 
make them at home just by sprouting navy beans in a shallow pan 
kept covered with a damp cloth, or buy them in Chinatown for a 
nickel a pound. They give the fresh crispness of salad when used 
in hot dishes and are most tasty when simmered in the pineapple 
juice that comes free with a can of Hawaiian slices or spears. 

Other Chinese specialties that are cheap in Chinatown and fine 
for varying salads and vegetable side dishes are Chinese cabbage, 
water chestnuts, called "Chinese potatoes," mustard greens, 
bamboo shoots, fresh ginger root and all sorts of strange bulbs and 
tubers you'll begin to hanker for, once you get the economical and 
refreshing habit of using them as the Chinese do — and it's well 
to remember they were the world's first great cooks and their 
chop sueys and such will still take a lot of beating. 

Another good Chinatown buy is lychee nuts, those sweet gummy 
meats the laundryman gives you for a Christmas present. They 
cost just half as much in Chinatown as in any uptown grocery and 
a pound of them makes dessert for several meals. 

STRING BEANS, SALTED DOWN 

Use string beans as young, tender and fresh as possible. Pack in 
kegs or crocks, put a good sprinkling of salt between each 3-inch 
layer of beans. Put a wooden cover on top and weigh it down. The 



EAT YOUR spinach! 1 57 

liquid extracted by the salt will rise over the cover and should be 
kept skimmed. When you*re ready to use some of them in the 
winter, soak most of the salt off, remove the strings and cook the 
same as fresh. 

This should be done in season, of course, when green beans get 
down to a few cents a pound in big city markets. While these 
won*t be just as fresh six months later as those expensive ones 
preserved by the new freezing process, they'll be fresher and 
cheaper than you can buy already canned and cooked. 

WILD CUCUMBERS 

These prickly little fellows abound in most parts of America 
and send out eager shoots that leap and climb faster and farther 
than squash plants, so that one tiny seed will make a vine that 
yields bushels of native cucumbers that needn't cost a cent. Some 
Southern manufacturers put them up instead of gherkins and this 
salubrious old-fashioned pickle now sells under the name of " Cute 
Cukes" in fancy groceries at fancy prices. You can fill a barrel 
with them on half a day's holiday in the country and pickle them 
with vinegar made cheaper and better at home, putting down a 
whole barrel of pickles for winter at just whatever you may want 
to spend for spices. They suit everybody's taste and are welcomed 
as a refreshing novely. You can stuff them with peppers to make 
them as attractive as stuffed olives. 

GROUND CHERRIES, OR HUSK TOMATOES 

There's a lot of confusion about these homely little bundles of 
luscious flavor that grow about the size of cranberries, each en- 
closed in a tissue husk that looks like a Chinese lantern. Some say 
they taste like cherries, others like tomatoes. We've eaten them 
ever since we were kids and don't yet know which they resemble 
most. When preserved in syrup they taste like figs. In any case, 
they're not common in city markets, but when they do appear 
they're dirt cheap. So if you can find them, get acquainted with a 
tart-sweet vegetable-berry that's great to eat plain or put up for 
winter.

UNFIRED FOOD 

While we don't take any stock in food fads, fanatically strict 
vegetarianism, subsisting on raw turnips and rain-water, or any 
advice that the poor should nibble grass so there'll be more wish- 
bones for the rich, we do think that a lot of fine food is let go to 
seed every year by needy families, especially in the suburbs, which 
would furnish the vitamins and minerals we need at no cost at all. 
So without going goofy on you, we'd like to point out the possibil- 
ities of edible weeds, flowers and leaves and the fact that all of our 
vegetables, fruits, spices and things grow wild in one part of the 
world or another and are so common in their native habitat that 
they're likely to be overlooked. 

Here are notes we took while reading a book by Dr. George J. 
Drews called Unfired Food: 

For making a salubrious Spring Tonic Salad use any of these: 
sour dock leaves, dandelion greens and the flowers cut fine, sour 
knot weed, young woodbine shoots, young linden leaves (slippery 
as slippery elm when chewed), shepherd's purse, nasturtium leaves 
and flowers, sheep sorrel, wood sorrel, plantain and lamb's quarter. 
For dressing such a salad use olive oil, peanut or corn oil, with 
chopped peanuts, pinenuts, and other nuts and maybe a spoon of 
honey or grated coconut. Simply toss together and serve. And 
instead of lemon juice or vinegar you can get a good sour dressing 
by grating rhubarb and squeezing out the juice. The juice of unripe 
grapes is also good; it was called verjuice by our forefathers who 
preferred it to vinegar. 

The tuberous roots of nasturtiums can be eaten like radishes. 

Pull the petals out of double marigold blossoms, chop them, mix 
with nuts and sluice with salad dressing. Or you might like chrys- 
anthemum petals in the same way — that's a great favorite in 
Japan. Pansies, water lilies, double zinnias, stock and the Rose of 
Sharon can all be used in the same way.

Handy Hints 



\ 



DO NOT THROW AWAY 

Bread. Quickly dip a stale loaf in cold water, crisp in oven and 
it will be better than when fresh. Dry stale slices, crisp in oven, roll 
and sift, store in a jar for crumbing fried dishes and for hasty pud- 
dings. Make into toasts and croutons. Throw odd bits into the pot 
when beginning to make soup, for additional thickening and 
nourishment. 

Pancakes. Reheat those left from breakfast, cut into ribbons 
and put into the soup just before serving — better than noodles. 

Bacon Fat, and Other Greases. Use for other frying. Or clarify 
and remove odors by simmering with hot water; let cool and 
harden, lift off the fat and store for deep-fat frying. 

Trimmings and Peelings of Vegetables and Salads. Put in- 
to the soup pot. 

Green Pea Pods. Make into cream of pea soup. 

Leftover Salads and Their Dressings. Into the soup pot. 

Scraps of Cheese. Grate and store in ajar; use with spaghettis; 
sprinkle over dishes for baking; mix with bread crumbs for frying. 

Vegetable Broths. Make soup of them or put into gravies. 

Bits of Cold Cuts and Store Sausage. Cut into small squares 
and put into potato salad. 

159. 



l6o MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

Bits of Cooked Vegetables. Mix into omelet or egg scramble; 
make baked vegetable hash of them, sprinkled with crumbs and 
grated cheese. 

Fish Heads and Bones. Set to simmer in cold water and use the 
broth, after straining through cloth, for fish sauces, or soup, or 
boil a whole fish in it. 

Cold Boiled Fish. Shred and mix with potato or other vege- 
table salad. 

Cold Fried Fish. Soak whole pieces for 2-3 hours in salad dress- 
ing. Serve with onion slices and a green garnish. 

Leftover Spaghetti and Other Pastes. Cut up, reheat, and 
use for stretching egg dishes. Soft bread crumbs and leftover po- 
tatoes, either mashed or sliced, serve the same purpose. 

Leftover Gravy. Add to the next gravy, or heat leftover veg- 
etables in it. 

Bones and Meat Trimmings. Into the soup pot, of course. 

Cold Fried Bacon. Reheat, crumble into a vegetable dish, or 
into the soup just before serving; or mix with scrambled eggs. 

Poultry Feet and Trimmings. Clean, scald and trim feet, 
simmer with trimmings, and use for gravy or soup; reduced, this 
broth makes the most delicious aspic. 

THE BEST ASPIC YOU EVER TASTED! 

And the Most Economical 

Use fresh chicken giblets, also the wing tips, neck and feet. 
Prepare feet by immersing 1-2 minutes in boiling water and re- 
moving skin and nails. Put feet with neck, wing tips, liver, heart 
and gizzard into a pan, add a little parsley, carrot, onion and 2 
cups of water for the parts of each chicken, simmer gently for 2>^ 
hours, which will reduce the broth to one-half. Flavor with lemon 
or strong sweet wine such as sherry, or both. 

It doesn't pay to use less than the parts of 3-4 chickens, but 
since nearly everybody throws away the feet and giblets, these 
can be bought separately from butchers who serve hotels. It 
shouldn't be either difficult or expensive to get the makings of 
this exceptional aspic which is even cheaper than making it of 
gelatine or calves* feet, which aren't stocked commonly, except by 



HANDY HINTS l6l 



kosher butchers. And there's no comparison between this tasty- 
aspic and one made of gelatine, or calves* feet. 

Fowl Fat. Chicken or turkey fat, reduced to oil, takes the place 
of melted butter and makes a tasty salad oil as well. Also makes a 
swell sandwich spread. 

Any Part Except the Quack. The meat packers got rich by 
utilizing every part of the pig down to the squeal, and we can 
keep from getting poorer faster by economizing on the duck and 
goose in the same way, using every part of the duck except the 
quack, and of the goose down to its hiss: 

1st: save the tongue, for that's the gourmet's pick of either duck 
or goose, throw away the bill and the eyes, but use all the rest of 
the head, neck, tip ends of wings, all giblets and trimmings of skin 
and fat. The feet must be blanched and skinned and the toe nails 
discarded. Wash everything well and put in a pan with a quart 
of salted water, carrot, the roots of celery and of parsley. Cook 
until the toughest piece (probably the gizzard) begins to get ten- 
der, then toss in a cup of rice, some celery and two beef cubes 
dissolved in a cup of hot water. By the time the rice is cooked most 
of the liquid will be absorbed and you'll have a fine dish at the cost 
of what most people throw away. 

Pope's Noses. The Pope's nose, which is "the part that goes 
over the fence last," is the tastiest tidbit of any fowl, especially 
chicken and turkey, so don't by any chance throw that away. 

VINEGAR 

A clove of garlic in a bottle of almost any kind of vinegar peps 
it up most pleasingly, that is, if you like garlic, and if your vinegar 
is made honestly — not out of wood shavings. 

It's good to have a stock of different-flavored vinegars on hand 
to vary the savor of mayonnaise and other sauces. Get good country 
cider vinegar if you can, and buy it by the gallon instead of in 
those tricky small chain store bottles made like magnifying bar 
glasses to make a very little look like a lot. Fresh or dried herbs 
are cheap in every "foreign" market and their full flavor can be 
added to a pint or quart of your bulk vinegar by using such com- 
binations as the following: 



1 62 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

In one pint of vinegar put i tablespoon each of minced water cress 
or highland cress, shallot, chervil and rosemary, with one clove of 
garlic, and let it steep in the sun until it's full flavored. 

In yi pint of red wine vinegar steep 4 tablespoons shredded cucum- 
ber rind, i tablespoon grated horseradish, i tablespoon minced 
chives or shallots. 

Or, I dessertspoon each of various seeds, such as celery, dill and 
caraway, made sprightly with minced cress, parsley and 2 capsicums. 

You can make your own wine vinegar by letting cheap California 
wine sour, adding the "mother'* from any old vinegar or a little 
yeast to start the acetic acid. 

It's always most satisfactory to make your own vinegar. Then 
you'll know what went into it. Apple juice, cider or peaches are 
best for this, but the following vegetable vinegars are cheap and 
satisfactory: 

VEGETABLE VINEGARS 

Tomato. Press juice from ripe tomatoes into a large vessel or 
crock, leave uncovered in a moderately warm place and it will 
quickly turn to vinegar. Add Yi cup molasses to every quart of 
juice if you want an extra-acid vinegar. 

In season, tomatoes should be almost as cheap as the dirt they 
grow in, especially in city markets on Saturday night, when all 
ripe produce has to be sold out because it won't keep until Monday. 

Beet. Run a bushel of washed beets through a grinder 2 or 3 
times to extract all the juice — put juice in open cask or crock 
covered against insects and light, set in the sun for 2-3 weeks and 
by that time you'll have several gallons of good tasty vinegar. 

Potato. To every gallon of water that potatoes have been boiled 
in put half a cake of yeast and a pound of brown sugar. This will 
turn to vinegar in less than a month, but it's not as nicely flavored 
as most. It serves, however, for cooking and making fresh cucumber 
pickles without salt, simply by putting in cucumbers cut fresh 
from the vines and adding dill if you wish. And the chances are 
that this potato peel product will be as good or better than the 
average store article. 

Nasturtium. Bruise Nasturtium flowers, cover with cold vinegar, 



HANDY HINTS 1 63 



add I shallot, and yi garlic clove to each quart. Set aside for 1 
months. Strain, add yi ounce cayenne and >2 ounce salt. 

MINT 

This fresh herb is so refreshing, especially in lamb sauce and 
lemonade, that a nickel bunch of it should always be on hand in 
the kitchen to use as the most-for-your-money flavoring in stews, 
sauces and beverages. It is packed so full of flavor that a sprig or 
two go farther than a whole handful of watercress or other lively 
relish. To our mind it's the most economical flavoring we know, 
and besides, mint seems exactly suited to our All-American taste. 

GARDEN GARNISHES AND MISCELLANIES 

Celery Curls. Cut stalks in 2-inch lengths and with a sharp 
knife cut ^-^ slits about i-inch deep in end of each piece and throw 
into ice water several hours before using, so they'll be nicely curled. 

Radishes. Remove tips and retain stem with sufficient green 
leaves to be attractive and make a good handle for eating them. 
Keep in ice water until wanted. Serve on chipped ice. 

Parsley Root. Many people throw away the roots of parsley 
after using the tops for garnishing, but some varieties have a fine 
tuber that's as savory as celery root for seasoning soups and stews; 
so that should never be thrown away. 

Capers. Since everybody relishes a relish, always have a bottle 
of capers on hand, for snacks and seasoning. A bottle needn't 
cost more than 20^ and can be used to pep up a plate of cold cuts, 
sandwiches, all sorts of tidbits, at a cost of less than a cent a 
person, for a bottle should be enough to spice half a dozen good- 
sized platters. In some places you can buy capers cheaper in bulk, 
or if you can get hold of nasturtium pods they're just as good. 
You pickle them simply by dropping them into a bottle of vinegar. 
The green seed-pods of radishes also take the place of capers, at 
no cost at all. 

Peas. A dish of French green peas is almost a meal in itself and 
is always served as a separate course over there. The secret is in 
cooking freshly shelled peas an hour in a little butter, with some 
bits of bacon, lettuce leaves, spring onions and parsley. The flavors 



164 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

of lettuce and peas not only complement each other, but the lettuce 
serves to put on top of the peas to keep them savorily smothered 
while cooking. Likewise, to perk up canned peas, cover them with 
lettuce leaves, add a little green onions and butter, or bacon, or both. 

Pepper Skins. Since these are too tough to eat, before using 
peppers as a garnish or in salad you can easily remove the skins 
by holding them over flame on a fork until skin begins to blister; 
then peel it off. 

Water. Water is Flavor Enemy No. i. Too much washing of 
meat and vegetables removes a great deal of their flavor. There's 
an old English song that advises: "But don't let the water get into 
the wine." The French, after washing lettuce, swing it in a basket 
until it's bone dry and able to absorb the oil of the dressing, while 
anybody who knows his mushrooms never washes them, but wipes 
them clean with a moist cloth. 

Cucumbers. Lots of people have an allergy to fresh cucumbers 
and few of us can get along without soaking them for a while in 
salted water. Although they're usually sliced like a loaf of bread, 
the way to get their full flavor is to slit lengthwise in quarters and 
instead of using black pepper, sprinkle with paprika. Fresh cool 
cucumber makes a fine contrast to eat out of hand with a dish of 
hot vegetables. 

Foods Free for the Picking. Even city dwellers have access 
to suburban fields and forests where there are herbs, nuts, mush- 
rooms, wild berries, fruits and even edible flowers free for the 
picking. It pays to learn about the good mushrooms, for instance, 
and gather a sack or two of these neglected foods on a holiday. 
You can have a feed or two of the fresh ones and then dry the rest 
by stringing them like necklaces and hanging in a dry place. Be- 
cause of their light weight when dried these cost a dollar and more 
a pound in the markets that stock them, and there's nothing so 
tasty in stews and soups. So if you don't want to trouble to gather 
and dry them yourself, you can buy a dime's worth, soak them over- 
night and give that old mushroom flavor to a whole gallon of soup. 

Pork and Mutton. As with oysters, the "R" months are best 
for eating both pork and mutton which are really in their prime 
only in October and November. 



HANDY HINTS 1 65 



Ripe Olives. Oily black olives are a gift to any cook who'll 
learn to use them. They cost very little in foreign neighborhood 
markets and are bursting with rich flavor which imparts piquance 
to many a stew and salad. 

Spaghetti. On English menus Italian paste products, spaghetti, 
macaroni and vermicelli are listed under "vegetables"; and while 
we do not think of them in this way, it's good to remember, espe- 
cially in winter, that if you haven't any vegetables at hand to give 
a lift to a meat stew, sometimes lightly cooked Italian pastes, 
especially if made of good hard wheat, take the place of vegetables. 

Juniper Berries. These peppy dried berries which we think of 
mostly for flavoring gin do just as cheerful a job when they're 
crushed and sprinkled over stews and hash. 

Popcorn. Buy the seed by the pound, pop it yourself in one of 
those mosquito-wire poppers and season with salt and melted 
butter, or do it cheaper by popping in lard in an iron kettle and 
then salting. It's the finest garnish we know for cream soups, where 
a few crunchy, buttery, snowy kernels scattered on at the finish 
make all the diflference in the world. It's great to eat by the handful 
with a glass of milk or to use as a cereal at a fraction of the cost of 
puffed grains put up by the breakfast food racketeers, or pack- 
ageers. Try it in a bowl of milk in place of bread, and savor every- 
thing by crumbling in bits of fine old store cheese. Makes a great 
snack at anytime and is just suited to the palate of this cornfed 
country. 

Peanuts. Cheap and handy for making anything from peanut 
soup to candy. In fact. Dr. George W. Carver of Tuskegee Insti- 
tute not only extracted sweet milk and rich cream equal to the 
cow's from this lowly nut that's chockful of food value, but he 
gave a five-course luncheon to food experts, consisting of 14 dishes 
in every one of which the chief ingredient was peanuts. And then 
he compiled 105 peanut recipes, ranging from peanut bread, rolls, 
cookies, wafers, muffins, doughnuts, to cake, salad and candy bars. 

Peanut Butter. Many commercial peanut butters are ruined in 
flavor by draining off^ the peanut oil to sell for a good price and 
then substituting cottonseed oil. If you don't know where to get 
honest peanut butter, which is the handiest sort of thing for help- 



l66 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

ing the flavor of all kinds of dishes, write to Llano Cooperative 
Colony, Newllano, Louisiana, and they'll supply the finest we ever 
tasted, at a price much lower than any chain store offers. 

Piping Hot. The recent success of sizzling platters, whose virtue 
is that the meat is still hissing on a metal platter when brought 
to table, proves that we like our hot dishes piping. This can be 
done with stews and vegetables as well, bringing them on bubbling 
in thick earthenware dishes, so they're as attractive as a savory 
Lobster Newburg or Welsh Rabbit made right on the table. It's 
also good to remember to heat the diner's plate in cold weather 
and in summer to chill plates before serving salad, cold consommes 
and such things on them, just as a good bartender chills his beer 
steins before using. 

HOMEMADE FIRELESS COOKERS 

We seldom hear of fireless cookers these days, but at one time 
not so long ago, they were a part of regulation kitchen equipment, 
and they cut dollars off the yearly fuel bills. World War propaganda 
further popularized them, for then all housewives were urged to 
save coal, not so much for their own account as for the dear Allies. 
Wheatless and meatless days, and fireless cookers for pure patriot- 
ism, with never a thought on the part of either war profiteers or 
their helpless fellow citizens that after-the-war-depression would 
bring enforced wheatless weeks and meatless months to millions. 

Metals, which are wasted in peace times on all sorts of useless 
contraptions, had to be conserved to their death dealing ends. So 
the press carried instructions for making fireless cookers at home. 
All one needed was a wooden box or paper carton, and a lot of old 
newspapers to insulate it, layers of paper fitted into the bottom of 
the box and around the sides, with a cylindrical hole left in the 
center to receive a boiling pot of soup or stew; then wads of paper 
on top to hold in all the heat for hours. An excellent device for 
long, slow cooking of cheap foods. Dried beans, peas, and lentils, 
tendered in their unbroken skins; and cereals, started the night 
before, are still hot at breakfast time and have attained a jelly- 
like and delicate consistency which only many hours of low heat 
can give. 



HANDY HINTS 1 67 



These economical, practical cookers will save coal now, just as 
they did then, and are well worth reviving. 

And before we leave the wheatless, meatless and eatless days 
when owner patriots urged wage-slaves' wives to half starve their 
families and "Win the War in the Kitchen," we'd like to record 
the fact that one of these Official Recipe Books was published under 
the chairmanship of Samuel Insull. 

SEASONING SECRETS 

A row of jars and bottles of home prepared seasonings is a never- 
ending inspiration on those days when one is distracted with think- 
ing up new ways to vary the menus. Herbs such as rosemary, 
savory, dill, marjoram and tarragon can be collected, one at a time, 
as they appear on the pushcarts. Dried and kept away from the 
air, they will last a year. The leaves from a bunch of celery will dry 
also, keeping their natural color and full flavor if laid on a pie tin 
in an open warm oven, or hung on a string over radiator or behind 
stove, until brittle. Piled up loosely in a covered glass jar, these will 
always provide fresh celery seasoning for the soup and stew pot, 
or roasting pan, for sauces and for gravies. Parsley cannot be suc- 
cessfully dried for commerce, but for one's own kitchen it will dry 
as well as celery and take the place of green parsley, especially if it 
is refreshed in cold water 15 minutes before using. Basil, too, can 
be dried at home in the same way. But living plants of basil or 
sweet marjoram, procured from florist or vegetable vendor, will 
grow in pots on any window sill, bravely putting out more leaves 
to take the place of the ones continually plucked oflF. In summer, 
fire-escapes in foreign sections of our cities always display tin cans 
and boxes of these two sturdy plants which are taken inside in 
winter. 

With this store of herbs should go a string of little hot red 
peppers, likewise dried out in the open oven, so they will not spoil. 
An unopened pod is not too much for a pot of soup. If only a portion 
is used, be sure the seeds are discarded. And be sure to take it out 
before serving, or some person will get more than his share of 
hotness. 



l68 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

There is nothing like herb variety for relieving food monotony 
and giving a family the feeling that they are eating something 
different all the time. Most herbs are both appetizers and aids to 
digestion besides, and thus they may be used freely without fear 
of injury to health. Although most of them are so strong that a 
little goes a long way, there are a few, like the faithful basil that 
grows in a pot, whose leaves can be scattered through green salads 
or, minced, may be put into the salad dressing until it is actually 
green. Basil is the best herb of all with tomatoes, either raw or 
cooked, and Italians like to lay a few leaves of it on a platter of 
spaghetti with tomato sauce, for each person to tear up a leaf and 
mix it in, or nibble at it whole, while eating. 

The time to lay in orange and lemon flavorings is when these are 
cheapest. Before cutting the fruit, carefully pare off the outside 
yellow covering of the skin in a long unbroken spiral with as little 
of the white sticking to it as possible. Toss the spirals over a 
string stretched in a warm place. When the moisture has dried out, 
but before the skin has become crisp, pack away in a glass jar. 
Eventually there will be two jars full, one of lemon and the other 
of orange peel, ready for the season when fresh citrus fruit is 
scarce and expensive. Two inches or so broken off will flavor soup, 
or pudding or pie, will give a zest to applesauce or other cooked 
fruits and is handy in concocting drinks. For use in certain cakes, 
cookies and puddings it is better to candy these peels. 

CANDIED ORANGE AND LEMON PEELS 

After juice has been reamed from oranges or lemons, tear out 
the membranes. Soak over night in water salted with i tablespoon 
of salt to the quart. Drop into fresh water and drain. With a 
spoon scrape off white inside, and cut with scissors into narrow 
strips. Mix yi cup of water with i cup sugar, add the peel and cook 
until the strips look clear. Drain, lay on a plate to cool, then roll 
in granulated sugar, letting as much sugar as possible stick to 
them. When dry pack away in jars or tin boxes lined with paper. 
If they become too dry after a time, warm them in the oven. 



HANDY HINTS 1 69 



CANDIED GRAPEFRUIT PEEL 

Grapefruit peel is so bitter that it should be parboiled for 15 
minutes after being taken from the salt water; and some people 
parboil, drain, parboil a second time and drain, before cooking with 
sugar. After parboiling follow the recipe for Candied Orange and 
Lemon Peels. 

There's a whole book about using citrus peels, if you're interested. 
Mrs. Florence Gilson Barton wrote and published it in San Bernar- 
dino, California, in 1928. It's called ne California Orange Cook 
Book, Complete and Explicit Directions for the Making of Candied 
and Glace Fruits, Jellies, Marmalades; Orange and Grapefruit Rinds 
in Decorative Forms and Preserves. And while you're at it, experi- 
ment with the rinds of Persian limes and kumquats. 




XXIII. The Pick of the Pushcart 

We've made our very best vegetable and fruit buys, over a 
period of thirty years, off pushcarts in the poorest sections of cities 
all over the world, not counting the unbeatable bargains on the 
tropical fruit wharves of Bahia and the raspberries and melons sold 
in season on every Moscow street corner and in the unbelievably 
bounteous Gastronomes throughout the Soviet. 

The reason for pushcart plenty is obvious, especially in a huge 
city like New York. In this broad land some fruit is always in 
season, and the pick of all crops comes to this highest priced 
market; so, since the best of it ripens en route, every day something 
or other arrives in the commission merchant's hands that's prime 
but risky for big dealers to hold for a gamble. He's either got to sell 
it out at once for what he can get, or throw it away. Shipments 
with slight imperfections also can't be resold to Park Avenue Bon 
Voyage basket fillers, so they're picked up by the haggard, hoarse 
street-hawkers who haunt Washington Market at dawn, with only 
ten or twenty dollars to invest in quick merchandise to load up 
pushcarts or a bag-of-bones horse and wagon they rent for from 50^ 
to ^3.00 a day. Without capital they can't hold out for prices as 
the chain stores do, so they yell and sell in Paddy's market, east 
side marts and on the streets, and if you know your artichokes, 
fresh figs, pomegranates or honeydews, the very best fruit value 
you can get is — the pick of the pushcart. 

The one sure quality test in picking out any kind of fruit is its 

170 



THE PICK OF THE PUSHCART I7I 

weight in comparison to its size. The heavier, the more mature, 
hence fullest of juice and flavor. Grapefruit offers an easy begin- 
ning; heft one in each hand and soon you'll come across a specimen 
as big as your head yet light as a balloon (please don't transpose 
this), while in the other hand youVe got one just half the size but 
heavy as a cannon ball. The heavy one is naturally the best buy, 
for the lighter one just has to be thick skinned and puffy — no juice ! 

In picking out any fruit remember it's already been handled 
enough by picker and packer, so don't pinch it to test its ripeness. 
Let the dealer do that, and he will, if his stuff is worth a darn. 
Always put it up to the seller to prove that his fruit is worth buy- 
ing. If he won't do that, buy from one who will. Pinching, of course, 
bruises any fruit and starts decay, so you can't blame a dealer for 
getting sore when an amateur ruins half a dozen avocados or 
peaches by amateur poking which makes soft spots that quickly 
lead to waste. 

With berries, melons and smaller fruits, if the seller has something 
worth buying he's glad to give you a sample taste. If not, beware. 

In buying berries always ask the seller to turn them out in his 
cupped hands or pour them into another box to show you that the 
bottom ones are fair-sized, sound and dry, not mildewed, unpal- 
atable runts. Naturally, you'll have to allow a little for those 
packed far down out of sight, since cheating has become an ac- 
cepted practice in our competitive society. Even the consumer 
has been taught to expect fruits and vegetables to get smaller 
and gnarlier as he digs down beneath the top "show" layers. 
Whether you're from Missouri or not, **show me" is the buyer's 
slogan; so look at the bottom always to make sure it isn't a 
false one built up like the bottom of a post-prohibition beer stein, 
or that the fruits beneath are not entirely worthless, and when 
buying by weight make sure there's no concealed brick or horse- 
shoe. Probably today spare-tires are used to make up the weight, 
but when a father of ours used to buy butter wholesale his testing 
plugger often struck fire on a "thrown" plough-horse shoe. And 
for God's sake don't be 100% American and embarrassed about 
looking for flaws; you can be sure the dealer has done it thoroughly 
in the first place and has refused to pay full price for fakes. So take a 



lyi MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

tip from him and if the stuff is of lower value than he asks, don*t 
pay the asking price like a meek little lamb that loves to be shorn. 
Just tell him plainly what it's worth to you. Never be afraid to 
bargain. We are, in fact, the only people in the world who take it 
on the chin by paying fixed prices for bad or good without a peep. 
We're dumb as mud-puppies about protecting ourselves in the 
most vital concerns of life. Advertising, movies and such models of 
exploitation have made us think that maybe it's more elegant to 
just sit down at the phone and ask the butcher "Otto, how's your 
liver today ? Okay, send me two pounds." We're ashamed to be seen 
out with a market basket and pretty soon we'll take to letting our 
little fingernails grow long like Chinese Rockefellers, to prove that 
we don't live by using our own hands. 

Recently organized labor has grown weary of the owner's old 
"take it or leave it attitude" and begun to bargain with the boss, 
so labor's helpmeet can help meet the high-cost of living by bar- 
gaining determinedly with all food-choker-off-ers and if they don't 
give in, she can organize and pull a boycott, a sort of sitdown 
buyers' strike. (And while the following is a bit off the subject we 
can't resist putting in about that Soviet foreman in charge of ship- 
ping lumber. In competitive days under the Czar he'd learned to 
load ships light by building at night a false bottom in the ship to be 
loaded. Although under Socialism he had nothing to gain by this, 
the habit was so fixed in him that he continued cheating comradely 
consumers' co-ops and couldn't be made to see the light until he'd 
been arrested three or four times. Likewise, the leading purveyor of 
fruit juice drinks under the Czar held on to his recipes for palatable 
adulterations until the Soviet showed him up by going back to the 
root of the matter and making drinks of pure juice alone. And 
finally these fine drinks aroused the respect of the old drink- waterer; 
so he went to work for the beverage trust, adding his skill and 
technique to making what are now the finest, purest fruit drinks in 
the world.) 

Though our own Government supports the competitive system 
which carries its share of germs of capitalist decay which one day 
will destroy the whole barrel, it gives honest advice about sharp 
practice and tells the consumer how to get his money's worth if he's 



THE PICK OF THE PUSHCART 1 73 

smart. So send a nickel (in coin, not stamps, and don*t ask us why 
the Government refuses the sticky little lozenges of paper it prints 
and sells for postal service at a price much higher here than in any 
country we know of) to the U. S. Department of Agriculture in 
Washington for Miscellaneous Publication No. 167, ^ Fruit and 
Vegetable Buying Guide for Consumers by R. G. Hill. We have used 
this bulletin with profit in our own summary of how to get your 
money's worth in buying fruits, but there's much more detailed 
information than we can pack in half a dozen pages: 

Apples. An apple a day may not keep the doctor away, but it'll 
keep almost anybody from falling for the phoney laxative ads. 
Since there are 500 different kinds on the market, don't buy just 
"apples." The kind we get in the East called Macintosh are a little 
more expensive, but we use their excellent flavor and juicy snap to 
judge all others. No apple should be too ripe, bruised or spotted. 
Medium-sized, thin-skinned ones are apt to be juiciest. And now 
that workers are demanding something more than the core, it's a 
good idea to list the most popular kinds and the seasons when 
they're cheapest. The Consumers Union's Buying Guide has 
summed up the apple situation for us, as follows: 

Favorite cooking apples are those having a slightly tart taste 
(Wealthy, Jonathan, Willow Twig, and Rome Beauty). Grimes 
Golden, Delicious, and Stayman Winesap are excellent dessert 
apples — but let us add that the Macintosh is best of all. 
September — Gravestein, Wealthy 
October — Jonathan, Grimes Golden, Delicious 
November — Jonathan, Spitzenberg, Delicious, King, Twenty

December — Jonathan, Spitzenberg, Stayman Winesap, De-

ton, Stayman Winesap

174 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

So don't be satisfied with just "apples," like those recipe writers 
who say "add a cup offish" without saying what kind and knowing 
why that kind is best. 

No summer apples are mentioned in this Consumers Union list, 
but local varieties known as "Harvest apples" are fine, though 
usually they won't keep. Most apples improve by long keeping, 
in fact "a last year's apple" is demanded by epicurean orchardists 
and readers of Proust. 

To our mind there's no better Sunday night supper than snow 
apples and a jug of sparkling hard cider, each trying to outsnap the 
other. Snow apples are so small and delicate they're often eaten 
seeds and all, so "there ain't gonna be no core." And for jelly, 
the ugly little crabapple that's much too puckery to gnaw raw, is 
a natural. Any other apple sliced into beer soup, or made into a 
Waldorf Salad with celery and nuts, is something to brag about. 

Apricots. Best, of course, are tree-ripened. Since they're perish- 
able they're best buys only near where grown in California, Oregon 
and Washington. The Persians call them "sun eggs," which shows 
they shouldn't be picked green. 

Avocados. (Alligator Pears.) Called "tropical salad fruit." 
There are many different kinds, those from California trade-named 
G?/avo (California and avocado) those from Florida, Flavocado. 
Rough, thick-skinned ones are fullest of flavor. When ready for eat- 
ing they must be soft as butter (in fact, they are fresh vegetable 
butter). Don't buy them when bruised or discolored. Cheapest in 
fall and winter. 

Bananas. Ripe bananas are best and can be bought advanta- 
geously when dealers can't keep a big ripe stock over the week-end. 
Must be fat and juicy with brown spots proving they're sugary. 
Don't be afraid of black skins if the fruit is sound inside. Bananas, 
by the way, are the only fruit we know that actually improves by 
being picked green. Yet we remember the rarer flavor of the natu- 
rally ripened fruit in Brazil. 

Berries. Must be fresh and plump. Red raspberries mildew 
quickly and should be used at once. Always have the seller turn 
out the berries so you can see what's on the bottom, and remember 
that "short pack" cheating in measure is common sharp practice. 



THE PICK OF THE PUSHCART 1 75 

Never buy "a pig in a poke." This business of buying sight-unseen, 
for which we fall too easily in our hurried, harried struggle for any 
life at all, only profits the seller. Berries with their caps on are likely 
to be green and juiceless. Make sure they're plump and juicy, but 
not wet and soggy, for then you'll waste more than you'll use. 
Your eye quickly learns to detect ripeness by full color and it's 
always a good idea to taste a berry or two if the seller is willing; 
and if they're any good at all, he is, for it pays him to let you prove 
"the pudding" by eating thereof. 

Blueberries are a better buy than drier, too seedy huckleberries. 

Cherries. Sour cherries for cooking, sweet ones for eating. They 
must be bright and shiny, fat, yet firm. Look out for worms and 
dull-skinned ones, which show they're too long off the tree. 

Cranberries. Good ones must be crisp and tender; by pressing 
one between thumb and forefinger you can hear the hearty snap. 
Those out of cold storage are apt to be leathery, shrivelled, soggy, 
or all three. As with all berries, they should be bought as fresh 
from the bush as possible. For making jelly and most preserves, 
fruit shouldn't have been picked earlier than the day before it's 
used. The fresher the better; and the most pectin, when it is a 
bit under-ripe. Pectin is the jelly-making constituent and it can't 
be duplicated by manufactured pectins, no matter what the siren 
ads say. 

Figs. Come in all colors of the rainbow and all sizes, each as good 
as the other in its way, but every one of them must be mellowly 
ripe to be worth a damn. They sour and ferment quickly, so watch 
your step! Many are being shipped from the blooming deserts of 
Arizona and New Mexico and we buy them in Paddy's market in 
prime condition for a cent apiece. With cream, they make as ex- 
ceptional dessert as peaches and cream, at about a nickel per eater. 

Grapefruit. Seedless ones are a better buy than those full of 
big slippery buck teeth that sometimes take up half the space in- 
side. But the best way to recognize your money's worth is by weight 
in relation to size, the heavier, the more juice for your money. 
Russet grapefruit looks rusty and on that account is sold cheaper 
in some places, but the flavor is just the same, or even better — as 
with brown and white eggs, white eggs always sell at a premium in 



176 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

New York while in the middle West brown ones may cost a little 
more. But both have the same nutritive value, which Consumers 
Union says is also true of Grade A and Grade B milk. 

Our pick of grapefruit is the pink-fleshed seedless one from Texas. 
It*s delicately yet fully flavored, pretty to look at and shouldn't 
cost more than the pallid white kind. 

Grapes. There are so many kinds of grapes, both domestic and 
imported, that only general rules can be given. They must be plump, 
heavy, fresh looking, fully colored and stuck firmly to the stem. 
If you gently shake a bunch and the grapes rattle off* like hail it's 
no good — and the seller will curse you, besides. But what are you 
going to do ? It's always wise to sample one, for some of fine quality 
when kept packed in sawdust too long taste like old corks. 

One of the best seasonal buys is the small seedless California kind 
that's been burbanked. It's easy to eat and sweet as Tokay wine. 

Lemons. Thin skin and golden color for plenty of juice. Some of 
the small thick-skinned ones are a bad buy; they don't give as much 
juice as a lime and are little better value than the old wooden nut- 
meg. Lemons are cheap in California, which produces the bulk of 
our supply, but in the East they're two or three for a dime even at 
the height of their season. At the same time, however, they're 
peddled on the pushcarts, just as good, even better quality, at five 
or six for a dime, but here you have to watch out for tiny ones, no 
bigger than pullet eggs, and both of them look fair-sized if there isn't 
a regular lemon or cackleberry handy to compare them with. To keep 
lemons fresh drop them in a jar of water and take them out as needed. 
That keeps them juicy and prevents the skin from mummyfying. 

Limes. Dark green ones are prime and the best of these are the 
big ones called Persians. But unless one is addicted to the piquant 
flavor of limes in sloe gin rickeys and such, we consider lemons, 
even small ones, a better buy. 

MusKMELLONS OR CANTALOUPES. Since most melons for market 
are picked green in the condition known as "half-slip," they're 
usually pretty punk and it's wise to ask for a slice of the same run of 
melons before buying. We've wasted so much money on these taste- 
less muskies that we're almost afraid to look one in the squinting 
half-slip eye. They're tempting to view, and sometimes wink at 



THE PICK OF THE PUSHCART 1 77 

you, but you simply can't tell anything about the taste from out- 
side appearance, except by smelling the stem end and that takes a 
really educated smeller. Finely-netted Rockyfords are fairly safe. 
Ripeness can be told by pressing; if it's firm and elastic that part's 
all right. With honey-dews and honey balls, however, it's wise to 
keep them a long time until you're dead sure they're dead ripe; 
otherwise you'll just have to throw them away. No melon should be 
kept in a damp place — that takes the flavor out. 

Nectarines. This cross of apricot and peach is pretty to look at, 
but usually not as mellow and full-flavored as either a peach or an 
apricot just by itself. In fact, if you bite into a nectarine with your 
eyes shut you'll say it's just a hard, tasteless peach. We've never 
had them fully-ripened from the tree, so this goes only for the kind 
picked green and shipped all the way across the continent, bump- 
ety-bumpety. 

Oranges. See 21 Ways to Eat i Orange, The best buys in this 
line are "grove or orchard run" trucked direct to town markets; 
they may not look as fancy because they aren't washed, waxed or 
polished, but they taste every bit as good, nay, even better. In 
New York's pushcart market known as "Paddy's" we always find 
bargains in the tangerine types, big King and mandarin oranges 
and the smaller satsumas, sometimes bursting in taste, and we pick 
them for tightness of skin in relation to weight. The light ones with 
the loose wrinkled skins simply aren't worth buying. Get the can- 
non-ball kind which go two or three for a nickel in season, after the 
bon voyage baskets have been filled with all they can hold, at a dime 
apiece. 

Peaches. A peach may look pretty and yet taste pretty punk; so 
the only sure test is to eat a slice. As with apples or tomatoes, when 
buying by the basket, ask to see what's at the bottom and if there 
aren't too many tiny, green, gnarly, wormy and rotten ones, they're 
worth buying if the price is fair. Reject spotted and bruised ones — 
too much waste. 

Pears. Weight according to size is the best test, but as with 
peaches, it's wise to taste before buying. You can always buy one 
to test, and that may save you the price of a whole worthless dozen. 

Pineapples. The only test for ripeness is to pluck a green blade 



178 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

from the center of the bunch that thrusts out at the top. But smell 
also comes into play, as with melons. Like figs, pineapples quickly 
ferment, so don't buy any with soft spots or squashy bottoms. As a 
matter of fact, although we always prefer any fresh fruit to canned, 
the Hawaiian canned slices and spears have an advantage over the 
fresh fruit in that they are picked fully ripe. We like the snap of a 
fine, fresh pine, but when we stop to figure that it costs three or 
four times as much as the canned article we pass it up. In general, a 
good canned brand is more dependable and brings with it a whole 
lot of appetizing juice that comes in handy for drinks and sauces. 
So, our mind is made up that canned pineapple is the very best fruit 
buy the year 'round. You're certain of quality with absolutely no 
waste. And canned slices or spears are a much better buy than just 
the juice, because you get both the fruit and a richer juice. 

Plums and Prunes. Prunes are a species of plum best suited for 
drying, but when fresh they're as fine as any plum or apricot. In 
fact Damsons are shipped from Washington under the name 
"Italian prunes." A grandmother of ours had a prune tree on her 
front lawn in Lansing, Michigan, and when the fruit was ripe we 
couldn't get enough of it. But since most of us haven't a yard, let 
alone a prune tree, we'll have to use what plums we can get and these 
are usually good value, if mellowly ripe but not squashy. Since the 
flavor varies widely with different kinds, it's always wise to sample 
one before buying a whole basket, for a juiceless plum can be as 
unpalatable as a wrinkled sun-dried prune. Try peeled green-gages 
just plain for Sunday night supper, or plum cake with tea. 

Pomegranates. One of the best pushcart buys we know is this 
classical food of Prosperpine, now grown abundantly in the West 
and shipped everywhere. The heaviest, biggest sunset-glowing ones 
are most-for-your-money and that money is usually a nickel apiece, 
or less, because only foreigners, Greeks and Italians especially, 
really appreciate this exceptional fruit. We Browns like the bitter- 
sweet tartness, yet often we leave them sitting around till they be- 
gin to wizen and dry, because we like their exotic decorative ap- 
pearance even more than that of Mexican ornamental gourds 
— probably because you can actually eat them after enjoying their 
colorful warmth. And another reason we don't rush to eat them is 



THE PICK OF THE PUSHCART I79 

because they're too hard to get at and then nibble, pip by pip. 
That's one way to eat them, but the worst. It's better to collect a 
mouthful at a time; but the easiest way is to cut a wide hole in the 
end, being careful to get rid of all bitter skin and then squeeze 
gently and suck as you would an orange. Very gentle squeezing is 
necessary, because if you bruise the skin or any of the million mem- 
branes, fibres, cores, or even the seeds themselves, you get a mouth- 
puckering dose. The juice makes a good drink by itself, with ice 
and plain or fizz water — we call it pomegranatade. You can also 
put a kick in a fruit salad by squeezing some tart pomegranate 
juice over it, or add a refreshing acid touch to such a drink as a gin 
rickey. But time and trouble must be taken to get only the juice of 
the pips and none of the skin, pith or seeds. The Syrians remove 
the pips in clumps, cut away the bitter cores and stew with sugar, 
flavoring with rosewater at the finish. 

Quinces. To be worth buying, quinces must be firm, but not 
hard; and yellowish, but not green. Otherwise they're too puckery 
for eating. The immature kind aren't even fit for canning, and 
bruised or wormy ones aren't worth carrying home. 

Strawberries. Wild strawberries are most flavorsome, but they 
seldom come to market; so, among the tame varieties, pick fresh, 
bright-colored ones, not for bigness, but for soundness of meat, 
because big ones can be almost as pithy as overripe radishes. Un- 
like other berries, it's safest to buy strawberries with their caps on; 
capless ones are likely to be mushy and worthless. Again, the ojily 
sure test is to taste one and, of course, the box should be dumped out 
into the dealer's palms to see just what you're getting at the bottom. 

Watermelons. Don't buy a watermelon without having it 
plugged. If the melon is big, the rind thin and the flesh deep red 
and juicy you'll find it good fruit value for the money. The bigger 
the melon the bigger its heart. And since watermelons that get to 
the city are high in price from their first appearance on Fourth of 
July all the way to Labor Day, don't waste the rind; preserve or 
crystallize it. The seeds when dried make good eating, too; so no 
part of a watermelon need be wasted. Not even its pig-tail stem 
which, if properly curled, can be worn as a ring at any watermelon- 
eating festival. 




XXIV. Fruity Desserts 

The best thing about an Italian mid-day meal is that instead of 
a fancy dessert a bowl of fruit is put in the middle of the table. And 
likewise, there's always a compote of stewed fruit to end the eve- 
ning meal. Nothing could be better to counteract the over-starchi- 
ness of a spaghetti diet — or a potato and bread diet like ours. So 
here are suggestions for serving fruit in season which needn't cost 
as much as the average dessert and should satisfy any healthful 
appetite: 

One peeled pear with a piece of very tasty hard cheese such as 
Parmesan to nibble with it. The cheese needn't be bigger than a 
twenty-five cent piece and the pear should be pared the last minute 
before serving, so it'll be fresh and juicy and won't have time to get 
discolored. 

When peaches are in season it's worth while to splurge on peaches 
and cream, since no other combination is quite so yummy. Half a 
pint of cream should do for six sliced portions; so the cost of this 
unbeatable dessert needn't be over a nickel per person, cream and 
all. 

For fruit cocktails, salads, cups and compotes buy a "bailer" at 
the 5 & lo. With this handy cutting cup you can turn contrasting 
balls out of melons and fruits and pile up luscious mouthfuls. One 
advantage of a ** bailer" is that you can salvage the sound parts of 

i8o 



FRUITY DESSERTS l8l

bruised fruits which are too far gone to be served whole, and it 
makes any fruit go farther. It*s fun to experiment with tutti frutti 
combinations in this way, and please remember that the juice of 
unripe grapes or lemon juice snaps up any fruit cup or salad, while 
vinegar may spoil its flavor, except maybe wine vinegar. 

In the Soviet, ice cream and compote are the favorite desserts. 
The compotes are simple but delicious, made of fruits in season, the 
more different kinds, the better, just stewed together with sugar 
and served cold in their juice. In contrast, fruit salad is popular in 
England where both fruit and money are much scarcer among the 
workers; so their salad is a watery concoction with a few discolored 
slices of banana floating in it and a couple of wilted grapes cut in 
half. 

Everybody dotes on baked apples and knows how easy it is to 
make a dish of them, but we're likely to forget that baked pears, 
peaches, plums, quinces, oranges — almost any fruit is just as salu- 
brious and easy to do in this fashion: 

Here are sample recipes: 

RUMMY GRAPEFRUIT 

Cut 3 heavy grapefruit in halves, remove seeds, but not the core, 
and loosen pulp from skin and section membranes. Cover with 
sugar to start the juice running and after >^ hour add more sugar 
and let stand another ]/2 hour. Then put in baking pan, add still 
more sugar and i tablespoon of rum or brandy to each half. Bake 
for 25 minutes in a hot oven, take out and let cool. Meanwhile stir 
some more rum or brandy into the pan juice and you have an in- 
toxicating sauce to pour over the fruit. If California brandy is used, 
this costs less than 10^ a serving and is worth it. 

CLOVE PEACHES 

Pare and halve firm, ripe peaches, put in buttered baking pan, 
stick 3 cloves in each half peach and fill the hole with i tablespoon 
sugar, dot with butter and sprinkle with lemon juice. Cover and 
bake in slow oven until peaches are golden brown. Serve hot, and if 
there is any juice left in the pan pour that over them. 



I 82 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

BAKED PEARS 

You don't want expensive California pears for this, but any 
good-sized hard pears, usually with a green skin, although ripe, 
costing 2 or 3^. Peel 6 pears, halve lengthwise and dig out core and 
seeds. Put in buttered baking dish and sprinkle with two table- 
spoons of sugar in which you've mixed about ^ of a teaspoon of 
powdered cinnamon. Put yi cup of water in the pan, cover and bake 
in moderate oven until pears are soft enough to stick a fork right 
through — this may take an hour. Chill and serve plain or with 
whipped cream. We don't think adding the whipped cream is worth 
the difference, but many people do. You may be able to make 
whipped cream out of a good brand of evaporated milk, according 
to directions on the can, but we have trouble in making this stand 
up long enough. 

STEWED PEARS 

Slice I beet and cook it 20 minutes in 2 cups water, saving only 
the red water. Pare, core and quarter 3-4 ripe pears, cook these 
in the beet water, sweetened to taste and seasoned with a little 
grated lemon peel. This makes an appetizing, rosy-pink pear. 

BREAKFAST SHORTCAKE 

Everybody falls for a berry shortcake, especially strawberry, 
but to make a good one it's necessary to mix a dough and bake. 
Easy imitations are made by splitting a store cake and heaping 
juicy crushed strawberries between layers, but we've discovered a 
quicker, cheaper substitute that we like, although it also only 
slightly resembles the real thing. Let's call it Breakfast Shortcake. 
Fill your individual cereal bowl J4> ^^11 with a good hot cooked 
cereal such as oatmeal, frumenty, or Pettijohns and plant a big 
pat of butter in the middle. Have ready plenty of cold strawberries 
crushed with sugar in their own juice, heap it liberally on top of 
the cereal and dip your spoon deep, bringing up the buttery hot 
cereal with a sauce of fresh strawberries and juice. You'll find that 
the steamy exhalation of the cereal mingles so perfectly with the 
fresh berry flavor that if you close your eyes you'll have a hard 
time telling it from a real old-fashioned shortcake. You can use a 



FRUITY DESSERTS 1 83 



butter substitute at about % price. We like the vegetable Nucoa 
for cooking and in some dishes it's hard to tell from real cow butter, 
although none of these margarines, derisively called " bull butter," 
can equal the real thing. 

The old saying that ** fruit is golden in the morning, silver at noon 
and leaden at night" has about as much scientific basis as most 
old sayings. A Chinese friend told us he was brought up on mid- 
night feeds of fruit left over or thrown out in the market where he 
worked, and he grew up healthier than any rice-fed coolie. For us, 
oranges are golden in the morning and apples equally golden at 
night, although we do think that cooked fruit is more digestible 
than most raw fruit for the evening meal, and an apple before bed 
may bring the doctor instead of keeping him away; it all depends 
on personal reactions. 

If you live where you can get it, juicy joints of sugar cane, cut in 
handy lengths and peeled, make a novel and satisfying dessert at a 
fraction of a cent a piece. Fresh figs are about the finest fruit we 
know, and they're now produced so abundantly in the South and 
West that they shouldn't cost more than a cent or two apiece. 
They're perfect to eat out of hand or to skin, slice and serve with 
sugar and cream, plain or whipped. And this goes for fresh guavas 
too, if there're any around. And peaches, of course — always ripe 
peaches and rich cream, if you can aflFord a nickel for dessert. 
As for grapes, the small, seedless green ones are our pick of the 
pushcart and we eat them vineyard style by throwing the head back 
and holding up a whole stem of them above our lips. As Caruso 
gargled his spaghetti, we nibble off half a dozen at once to make a 
whole mouthful of grape juice at a time. But maybe it's more 
refined or something, to pick them off one at a time; so if you eat 
them that way, please wait until you've got a palmful and then 
pop them into your mouth all at once. It'll be a pleasant surprise 
to your taste buds, for the juice of each grape helps flavor the other 
and your palate gets a big kick out of that. 

We don't want to be accused of tempting to extravagance by 
giving sweet cream as an ingredient; we'd rather use sour cream 
or evaporated milk; yet some fruits, especially peaches, fresh figs 
and strawberries simply holler for cream; so try sour cream at 



184 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

half the price of sweet, because only "foreigners" go for it; it's 
pure and harmless if you get it from an honest dealer. Cover the 
sour cream with sugar and dip strawberries in, holding by the stem, 
English fashion, and bite them off from the hulls one at a time. 
The snap of the sour cream livens the fruit and the combination 
with sugar gives that "sweet-sour" relish which the famous chefs 
of Strassburg strive for. 

Cranberries should be cooked whole; and if you haven't tried it, 
you can't imagine how much is added to the flavor of cranberry 
sauce by strewing on top a few crushed nuts or almond slivers. 
Also, try a cranberry juice cocktail for a change and mix cranberry 
sauce in your next tapioca pudding. 

Fruit bars are a cinch to make at home and of course these are 
much better and cheaper than any you can buy. Just grind up any 
mixture of dried fruits (which you are sure haven't been preserved 
with too much sulfur dioxide) with peanuts, pine nuts or any good 
value in nuts and press them together. The fruit paste will make 
them stick together. Dust with powdered sugar and cut into 
handy bars for yourself and the kids. Dates are great for this and 
almost as cheap as sugar, and figs are equally fine, but more ex- 
pensive. By the way, try slicing dates on custard or into a lettuce 
salad. Beware of raisins, dried peaches, pears and apricots, how- 
ever, for in spite of government regulations against poisoning, 
the greedy driers and packers often use too much poisonous sulfur 
dioxide to preserve them. So let them eat it themselves. 

If you can get honest dried fruits that come within the U. S. 
Food and Drug limit of 350 parts by weight of sulfur dioxide in a 
million parts of dried fruit (including most brands of prunes), try 
soaking them in a little grape juice or California sherry. Then 
you've got something! 

FRESH FRUITS ICED 

Beat together the white of i egg and 2 tablespoons cold water. 
Dip in selected bunches of seeded grapes, roll them at once in 
powdered sugar and place them on a sieve to dry. When dry keep 
in a cool, dry place until wanted to serve. Currants on the stem, 
plums, cherries, large sound raspberries or strawberries may be 
iced in the same manner. 



FRUITY DESSERTS I 85 



CANTALOUPE 

Wash thoroughly, dry and lay in a dish on ice till serving time. 
Never allow ice to touch the flesh of a melon as the moisture injures 
its flavor. 

FRESH PEACHES 

Choose large, fresh, ripe, juicy peaches; pare, and cut into 
luscious mouthfuls. Sprinkle with granulated sugar, put into the 
freezer and half freeze them. Do not remove from freezer until the 
moment of serving, then sprinkle again with sugar and arrange in a 
glass dish. Canned peaches may be treated in the same manner. 

Grapes. Drop the bunches into ice water for 10 or 15 minutes 
before serving. 

Pineapple Spears. Turn out from can, pour sherry over and 
chill for 2 hours. 

Prunes. Soak ^2 pound of prunes in tepid water for 2 hours, 
then boil gently until half done. Sweeten to taste, add yi cup of 
wine and eat hot or cold. 

BANANAS 

Saturday bargains usually give one the very best bananas, fully 
ripe ones, freckled with brown sugar spots, which will not keep for 
sale on Monday. These are marvellous simply grilled or baked in 
their skins until the outside is nearly black and the inside is 
soft. They must be eaten as soon as done, served whole, each 
person slitting the skin with a knife and sprinkling sugar and 
cinnamon on the steaming pulp. 

Or a half dozen, peeled, broken in two, and laid in a deep bowl, 
with lemon juice, plenty of sugar, and bits of lemon (rind and all 
except the seeds) scattered through. Bake until the top is browned 
and the fruit is soft but not mushy. They form their own juicy 
sauce. 

Split and rolled in flour and fried, they are a treat with meat, 
especially sausage, and they look pretty on the same platter with it. 

Peeled, split, and grilled, they are a tasty accompaniment for 
chops, especially pork chops. 



I 86 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

A cupful of mashed bananas with juice of a lemon, sugar to 
taste, and two cans of evaporated milk makes good ice cream. A 
cupful of sliced bananas is added after freezing commences. 

If the bananas are not too ripe, they can be cut into thinnish 
lengthwise slices and fried, after being dipped in sugar. Or they 
may be thinly sliced diagonally, dredged very lightly with flour, 
shaken to remove superfluous flour, and fried in deep fat like potato 
chips — no sugar with these, but you might like to salt them very 
lightly. 

CANDIED FRUITS 

Prepare a thick syrup with i cup of water to each pound of 
sugar; cook in this until tender, but no longer, sections of citrous 
fruits, slices or bits of peaches, plums, pears, apricots, cherries, or 
almost any prepared fruit. Let fruit remain 2 days in syrup; then 
take it out, drain, and sprinkle sugar over each piece separately. 
Dry them slowly in the sun or in an oven not too warm. 

Sections of orange, grapefruit and tangerine, lightly warmed 
until skin dries and then chilled, are fine just plain or in this candy 
syrup. 

APPLE GINGER PRESERVES 

Tie a little ginger root in a muslin bag and boil in clear water until 
the water is well flavored. Make a syrup with i cup of this water, 
iy2 cups sugar and juice of half a lemon, to i pound of apples. 
When syrup is skimmed, boil in it a few quarters of the apples at a 
time, until they become clear — not a minute longer — and remove 
carefully. Replace apples in syrup when it becomes cold. 



XXV. 21 Ways f\ to Eat 1 Orange 




Much of the value of food is lost by serving it dully. 

To get your money's worth out of such a common thing as an 
orange, for example, you should eat it in the way that's most 
attractive to all the senses of sight, touch, smell and appetite. 
That's how they do it in Spain, the West Indies, Brazil, Florida, 
California — in fact everywhere that oranges are raised. 

I. The very handiest and juiciest way we have ever encountered 
is to jab a strong steel fork through the blow or blossom end (the 
other is the stem end). Hold your fork straight up in the air, as 
table manners say you shouldn't, and with an extra sharp steel 
knife cut off not only the skin but an eighth of an inch or less of 
the pulp beneath, so the juice begins to bleed and there are no dry 
tough membranes to obstruct your hearty tooth work. Cut off 
all the skin, that is, except a small cup of it just around the fork, 
which part you loosen up to catch the juice, and that's the reason 
the fork is held upright. Also, it's important to jab that fork right 
in to the hilt to keep the orange from wobbling, since this slicing 
art is a little strenuous. The knife must be steel and very sharp. 
Steel is the only metal that should ever touch any citrous fruit, 
since it doesn't affect the taste or change the temperature as 
other metals do. 

When finished you have the most enticing juicy globe you ever 
sunk teeth in. Then all there is to do is hold the fork steady while 
you chew your way around, occasionally supping up the juice 
that quickly collects in the little cup of skin at the bottom. We can 

187 



I 88 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

never think of oranges without seeing Art Young's cosmic cartoon 
of that swollen profiteer squeezing the juice of an orange into his 
lardy face while a hungry little you-and-me stands between his 
legs, about knee-high to that whopping grasshopper, catching the 
drip. 

Although there are easily loi ways to eat i orange, we haven't 
room to list them all here; these samples must suffice: 

2. West Indian Juice and Pulp — pick out a thin-skinned, ripe 
and juicy orange for your victim. Roll or knead it as you would 
a lemon to gently break down some of the juice cells. Then take 
a thin, springy knife of trusty steel, sharp enough to slash a seed 
in two as neatly as a razor severs a hair. Cut over a bowl to catch 
the juice as you pare the skin off deeply in a continuous spiral, 
just as you peel an apple in the Halloween game of throwing the 
skin over your shoulder to divine the initials of your future mate, 
or something. Drop the bleeding orange into the bowl and gently 
press out all the juice that flows freely. This you drink, and you'll 
find its flavor miraculously better than just mechanically reamed 
juice; for it is the virgin sap, unmixed with pressed pulp, the same 
as the grape juice which makes the first cru of fine wines (indeed 
the best Tokay is obtained from grapes that press themselves by 
their own weight). 

The orange pulp is then chewed from the slightly pressed core, 
and in order not to waste anything you can throw the skin over 
your shoulder and read your fate, or better still, keep it to drape 
from the rim of a tall drink glass and spiral down in the liquid 
in the style known as Horse's Neck. 

3. Sucking — first roll a thin skinned orange (the kind called 
Valencias in the trade) on a board or between your hands, to start 
the juice running; then with your -sharp knife cut away all the oily, 
bitter, colored skin at the stem end, leaving a wide rim of the white 
to soothe the lips. Ream the fruit with a thin blade, cutting away 
top tissues of the sections and starting the juice sluicing from all 
of them. After that Nature tells you just what to do. 

4. Sweet sucking — make a little bigger hole and push one or 
two cubes of sugar well down toward the center, then suck the 
juice through the sugar, as Russians suck tea by holding a sweet 



21 WAYS TO EAT I ORANGE I 89 

lump of candy or sugar between the teeth and inhaling the hot 
tea through it. Or improve on this by thrusting a piece of pepper- 
mint candy stick straight through the middle, from hole to heel, 
and suck up the juice with that fine flavor added. 

5. Cinnamon-flavored — push down a couple spoonfuls of cinna- 
mon sugar in place of the cubes, or use the tiny red cinnamon 
drops that also flavor baked apples. You might like to suck it 
through the natural straw of a whole cinnamon stick instead; or 
give it a mint flavor by pushing in a couple of life-savers, or add 
spicy oriental zest by sticking in 3 or 4 sen-sen pellets, licorice — 
almost any high-flavored candy that will dissolve as quick as sugar. 

6. Alcoholic — first soak your sugar cube in rum, kirsch, curacao, 
brandy, or your favorite liqueur. This makes a fresh fruity cocktail. 
There's no objection, of course, to mixing your drinks in this 
innocuous style; so soak one lumpjn rum, and the other in whatever 
liquor or liqueur you fancy, even gin, to make your own Mr. Boston. 

7. Halving — cut a wide strip of the colored skin around the 
belly band, leaving the white. Slice orange in half and gnaw, or 
spoon out the contents with a pointed spoon. 

8. Mexican style — as above, but sprinkle with coarse salt, 
and red pepper. 

9. In quarters or eighths — halve each half or quarter it, to 
make handy mouthfuls for snapping up with the teeth. 

10. In sections — peel away all skin, or knead it a little and 
strip oflF with your fingers; remove any white or membranes, sepa- 
rate into sections and either remove the fruity cellophanic wrapping 
from each or eat them individually as is. Or split lengthwise and 
suck the flesh out of the tissue wrapper. 

11. In Segments or Wedges — peel deep with a sharp knife so 
not only skin and white are sliced off but the top membrane of the 
juicy meat as well; leaving it exposed. A sharp steel knife is neces- 
sary because a dull one will make the juice bleed. Always remember 
— never use a silver fruit knife on an orange, not only because it's 
dull, but because it spoils the taste, and is too good a conductor of 
heat. Steel ruins the flavor of some fruits, but not the citrous ones.

your mouth. You'll find these more succulent than sections still 
wedded to the membrane. The easiest way to do this is to jab a 
fork in the end all the way down to the core, to use as a firm handle. 
For this method, the bigger the orange, the better. A variation 
is to peel off only the acid colored skin that bites the lips and then 
slice oflF irregular wedges from end to end, using the white pith 
as a handle in eating. 

12. Sugared Wedges — heap in a saucer the kind of sugar you 
prefer, granulated, powdered, brown, maple, or even colored. Make 
wedges as above and dip in each slice expertly on its way to your 
mouth. A few drops of orange flower water, curacao or rum sprin- 
kled over the sugar gives a fragrant, elusive overtone. 

Try this with maple syrup or honey, if you will, and even add 
dashes of liqueurs, rose water, Angostura Bitters or one drop of 
Tabasco. 

13. Rummed Wedges — vary the above by filling your saucer 
with kirsch, cognac, curacao, rum or any favorite tipple, with or 
without sugar, and just dunk the wedges ad lib. 

14. Peppy Wedges — do them Tehu an tepee style for a change 
by just touching an edge to salt and red pepper, or paprika, mixed 
in your saucer. This really gives an amazing flavor, if not used 
too hot, but maybe you have to be born along the Texas-Chili 
border to really go for it in such style. But pepper and salt do make 
oranges sweeter the same as they do honey-dew melons, and they 
also are supposed to help one digest them. 

15. Rim Triangles — leave skin and everything on, slice the 
orange into rounds of pleasing thickness, as you would cut up a 
whole loaf of bread. Then cut each round or slice into handy tri- 
angles and use the rim of skin for a handle to lift them to the 
mouth one by one. Eat as is, or dip in anything sweet, or peppery. 
Perhaps you'd like to try them with a touch of ground cloves or 
ginger for a change. There's no law against experimenting. 

16. Whole sliced — peel with a sharp knife, right into the juicy 
meat, then slice down in whole rounds, sift a little plain sugar, or 
fancy sugars, each of a diflferent color or flavor if you like, between 
the slices, sandwich them up in the original orange shape and you 
have a flavorsome melange or rainbow to fork into your mouth slice 
by slice, or cut down in mouthfuls with a sharp knife. And don't 



21 WAYS TO EAT I ORANGE I9I 

let us discourage you from seasoning one layer sweet and the next 
salty or peppery for piquant contrast. Go as far as you like, dust 
on different spices, sprinkle on a drop or two of Tabasco or An- 
gostura Bitters. There's plenty of gastronomic authority for all 
of these and more besides. And by the way, the smallest oranges 
are best for slicing and often as sweet as though you'd actually 
stolen them. 

17. Crosscut slices — cut the peel right off to the juicy meat. 
Then instead of slicing straight down, slice on the bias, removing 
any outstanding pith or membranes. Cut these slices in ^s, J^s, 
8ths, i6ths, or hash them, but be sure to catch all juice in a saucer 
and eat everything out of it with a spoon, plain or seasoned to 
fancy. 

18. Creamed — dab cream cheese, mayonnaise, or whipped 
cream on oranges sliced in any style you fancy. 

19. Rolled — like candied apples on a stick, oranges may be 
peeled right down to the juicy meat and then rolled in coconut, 
crushed peppermint stick or cinnamon drops, cocoa, paprika, 
crushed ginger nuts, or any spicy dust you say; harpoon firmly 
with your fork and nibble around at leisure. 

20. Skewered or pegged — in Kingston, Jamaica, at the colorful 
Hallelujah Market, oranges are sold freshly pared to the pulp, 
run through with wooden skewers, a small patch of skin left at 
each end to hold the stick tight. They're eaten on the spot, simply 
by holding at both ends and rotating the luscious morsel between 
the lips for snatching juicy bites. The same custom prevails 
throughout the West Indies, from Bermuda to Trinidad, and is 
commonly called "pegging." 

21. Fancy forking — all eating of whole oranges impaled on 
forks is but a refinement of the skewer method, to avoid using 
both hands. But there are even fancy refinements of orange fork- 
ing, adopted by ladies who don't like to smear the lip-stick all 
over the ears. One is to leave the skin on and cut in six or eight 
slices, not around the middle of the orange, but from stem to stern. 
Then each slice is impaled with a fork through the skin; seeds and 
excess membranes are cut away, and the new-moon segments 
chewed most elegantly, while held horizontal with the fork. 

In preparing oranges whole, it's well to recall the Assyrian prov- 



192 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

erb — An orange is like a cat on a chimney pot. It may look round 
to you, but it isn't. 

And another good saw to remember is — The more juice in the 
eye, the less in the mouth. 

People in prunes-and-prisms days used to say with shocked 
modesty that oranges shouldn't be sucked in public and that really 
the only suitable place to consume one was in the privacy of the 
bath tub. They're wrong; that's the proper place to mangle a mango. 
Here's a juicy quotation of those orange horrors, from Cranjord: 
When oranges came in, a curious proceeding was gone through. 
Miss Jenkyns did not like to cut the fruit for, as she observed, the 
juice all ran out nobody knows where; sucking (only I think she used 
some more recondite word) was, in fact, the only way of enjoying 
oranges, but then there was the unpleasant association with a cere- 
mony frequently gone through by little babies and so, after dessert 
in orange season. Miss Jenkyns and Miss Matty used to rise up, 
possess themselves of an orange in silence and withdraw to the privacy 
of their own rooms to indulge in sucking oranges. 

Some people like to chew the fresh peel or just sit for a while and 
smell it, and we see no harm in that, unless it's one of those "Color 
Added" abominations. The only fit use we can think of for those 
fakes, that even come tied up in red bags so they'll look healthy- 
cheeked until you get them in your hand, is to turn them inside 
out as containers for blue-flamed Cafe Diable^ or to make one of 
those silly little scalloped baskets with or without a bow-ribboned 
handle, to hold the inedible pats of fruit salad with which cus- 
tomers are molested at penthouse pink teas. 

Half of the promise of an orange lurks in that natural golden 
glow which gave it the name ''Golden Apple" in ancient days. 
Oranges too were then considered to be the mythical ambrosia 
that the gods snacked upon; and some sentimental prohibition- 
ist or fruitarian once jingled: 

"Here's to the orange. 
The fruit divine, 
Whose golden juice 
Is better than wine." 

But the chorus to this is obviously **0h yeah?"

add a teaspoon vanilla or lemon extract, or 4 drops bitter almond, 
or J4 teaspoon of peppermint or wintergreen essence. Pull until 
light colored and porous, stretch to a rope about half an inch thick 
and cut with shears into inch lengths. Wrap pieces in waxed paper.

meats or raisins may be added while beating, if desired, or a cup of 
marshmallows, cut in pieces, may be beaten in. 

CREAM CANDY 

Crease a marble slab, or a platter. Put 1 cups granulated sugar, 
I cup boiling water and i tablespoon butter in saucepan over fire, 
stir until sugar dissolves, then cook without stirring. If beads form 
on sides of pan, wipe down with damp cloth. When a little of the 
syrup, tested in cold water, will make a hard, rubbery ball between 
fingers, remove from fire and pour on platter, or slab. Take up as 
soon as syrup can be handled and pull as long as possible. Form to 
slender rope on slab and cut in i-inch lengths with shears. Flavor, 
while pulling, with Yi teaspoon of any desired flavor. Leave uncov- 
ered overnight, place in a glass jar with waxed paper between 
layers, and screw on top. The next day it will be so creamy it will 
dissolve on the tongue. 

The reason candymakers prefer a marble slab is because it quickly 
cools the candy for working. An old marble bureau top is fine for this. 

GLAZED FRUITS 

String on strong, white linen thread or straws dry, sliced fresh 
pineapple, ripe grapes, sections of oranges and grapefruit. Put 2 
cups sugar, i cup boiling water and yi tablespoon of cream of tartar 
in saucepan. Stir until sugar dissolves, bring to boiling point and 
continue boiling without stirring until syrup spins a long thread 
from tip of spoon when tested. Remove saucepan from fire in- 
stantly and place in larger saucepan of cold water to stop boiling; 
then remove from cold water and place in a saucepan of hot water. 
Dip into it a string of the sliced fruits. It is easier to make these 
short and all of a kind on i thread, but vary them if you like. Dust 
with powdered sugar as fast as each is dipped and lay upon waxed 
paper to harden. Nuts may also be dipped in this way, but care 
must be taken not to split the meats in stringing.

SUNKISSED STRAWBERRIES 

Wash berries, drain and hull them. For each pound of fruit take 
I pound of sugar, and don*t do too many at a time — 3 pounds is a 
generous amount. Put them in a preserving kettle with enamel 
lining, make a heavy syrup with 3 pounds of sugar and i cup of 
water and pour this over berries, shaking kettle to cover the berries 
well. Set over fire and cook 15 minutes after boiling begins. Pour 
into earthen plates or platters, cover with glass, not too close to 
shut out the air, and set in the sun. In 2 days, if the sun is properly 
amorous, the syrup will be thick, richly colored and ready to store 
in jars or glasses, the same as for jelly. 

Since no monopoly has got hold of the sun's heat yet, there's no 
charge for the cooking in this recipe.

or a cup of nutmeats for a change; or if 2 tablespoons of flour are 
omitted and a grated ounce of chocolate added with a teaspoon of

This frosting may take a little more skill to make than a butter 
frosting or one made with confectioner's sugar, but it is well worth 
the trouble, since it has no peer when it comes to real creaminess in 
taste. Besides it may be varied ad infinitum by additions to the 
frosting. Nutmeats, chopped figs, marshmallows, raisins, dates or 
a melted square of chocolate are a few suggestions.

XXVII Frozen Desserts 



The ghastly expose of certain commercial ice creams and similar 
frozen products has driven many of us back to the home freezer. 
Such foods should be under the same control as our milk supply, 
since they are subject to the same adulterations, and are carriers of 
typhoid and other dangerous disease germs. But legal standards 
for the manufacturers are undoubtedly too low and inspection to 
enforce existing laws has proved inadequate. 

The Consumers Union tests of over forty bulk and packaged 
frozen creams and milks, made in New York City and probably 
typical of most cities, revealed that many of the well known makers 
are guilty of slick practices to defraud the public and of permitting 
unwholesome conditions of manufacture. In the case of bulk ice 
creams, the chance of uncleanliness of the distributor doubles the 
health risk. Since the same survey revealed that there are pure 
products on the market, and that all ice creams are not blown up 
with air or deficient in butter fat, it becomes the personal concern 
of every consumer to protect both health and pocket book. The best 
buys come in bulk, but it is not enough just to take a peek at the 

204 



FROZEN DESSERTS 20$ 



dealer's refrigerator, his utensils, hands, and the cloths with which 
he washes up. Local plants, where the stuff is made, should also be 
checked. An active housewives' association is the best spur toward 
a clean ice cream factory. 

Let no woman repine that she hasn't an electric refrigerator when 
it comes to making frozen desserts. We have tried about twenty 
recipes in our refrigerator before returning to the old fashioned ice- 
salt-grinding method, at least until the time when refrigerator 
freezing units are better adapted to this purpose. We got the worst 
results from packaged "mixes," finding them deficient in quality. 
A number of our recipes, based on milk, which required eggs, corn- 
starch, flour or gelatin to give body, had to be removed and stirred 
so many times to ensure smoothness that the labor and attention 
seemed greater than if we had made one job of it in a freezer. The 
long freezing time required, never less than four hours, made the 
process a nuisance, too. From all points of view, there was only one 
recipe we ever cared to repeat, and that was a mousse; just pure 
cream, seasoned and sweetened. And this is not so expensive as it 
sounds, for the cream is always whipped for mousses, making it go 
twice as far. Since no other liquid was added, the whipped cream 
froze smooth and rich without stirring. 

Our second choice, not so flavorsome, but more economical, was 
a combination of whipped cream and gelatin dissolved in milk, as 
follows:

}^ CUP SUGAR I>^ TEASPOONS VANILLA 

Sprinkle gelatin over surface of cold water; add hot milk, sugar 
and salt; stir until gelatin dissolves; let cool until it begins to 
thicken; then whip until light. Whip cream until stiff, add powdered 
sugar and vanilla; fold into whipped gelatin. Put into ice trays and 
freeze; stir once, after freezing for an hour. 

When we moved to the country last Spring, no one in the Brown 
family was sorry to exchange the little apartment kitchen, with its 



2o6 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

electric refrigerator, for a real kitchen and an old-fashioned icebox. 
For less than a dollar we bought a freezer which makes two quarts 
of ice cream in a jiffy, with a minimum of ice and salt. On hot days 
we have had our own frozen desserts which cost no more, even when 
made entirely of cream, than the blown-up counterfeits sold by local 
purveyors. We can buy a quart of cream — but no less than a quart 
— from our milkman at the wholesale price, around 60^. Then we 
add a pint of something to it, and the mixture swells to two quarts 
in freezing. That pint of something may be one cup of crushed fruit 
and one cup of the same fruit, but cut up — not crushed — peaches, 
berries, bananas, or canned pineapple. The crushed fruit is mixed 
with the cream, then sweetened to taste, and the cut-up fruit, first 
sweetened, is put into the freezer when the mixture has begun to 
congeal. If no suitable fruit is at hand, we just add a tin of evapo- 
rated milk instead, to make up the proper bulk, sweetening and 
seasoning as we like. 

Such ice creams as these are rich in butter fat, and the expense of 
them can be charged up to the nourishing part of the meal. But 
since we eat frozen desserts for their comfort-giving coolness rather 
than for nourishment, a frozen custard answers the same purpose 
at smaller cost, and has a quality all its own, except when it's made 
in one of those fraudulent Coney Island contraptions, which use 
more air than any other ingredient.

PLAIN VANILLA ICE CREAM 

This old-time favorite has stood the test of popularity for a cen- 
tury, ever since Carlo Gatti introduced ice cream to England and 
other Italians brought it over to this country: 

I QUART SWEET CREAM yi POUND SUGAR 

VANILLA BEAN 

Scrape the small black seeds from a two-inch section of vanilla 
bean and mix pod and all into cream and sugar, dissolving the sugar 
in the cream over gentle heat and removing the piece of vanilla 
bean pod before cooling the mixture and freezing. This seedless 
vanilla bean pod can be used several times for flavoring other dishes, 
and should always be saved until it gets as worn out as an old piece 
of leather. 

The black specks of vanilla seeds were formerly thought to be 
pepper, put in for the sake of the stomach, to heat up the cold dish 
and counteract any ill effect on the digestion. At least one modern 
ice cream maker still uses this unbeatable recipe and advertises 
**Look for the specks!'* to prove it's genuine. Old-timers used to 
dust their pre-sundaes with the pepper shaker, too. It's terrible! 

Mexican vanilla beans are much better than even the best pep- 
per. Usually they're sold singly in glass tubes about 8 inches long, 
costing about a quarter, and to our mind they are better value than 
liquid vanilla extracts, which of course have only a trace of the true 
flavor of the bean.

Since peanuts are rich in fat and, indeed, a cream as well as oil is 
extracted from them, this recipe calls for much more milk than 
cream, yet it will be quite as rich as old-fashioned ice creams which 
call for cream only. 



XXVIII. Rich Man iS^, 




Poor Man 



^ 



It's enlightening, even refreshing, to contrast lavish recipes for 
indigestible dishes, made to tickle the palate of the rich and often 
labelled a la Financiered with others that have been known for 
centuries as Poor Man's Sauce, Poor Man's Pudding, Poor Boy 
Sandwiches, Poor this and Poor that till you're blue in the face. 
Some are lousy, others swell; and when it comes to a steady diet the 
poor-boy recipes have the splurgy ones beat a mile, but what gets 
us down is the silly self-consciousness of the poor themselves who 
invented these sound recipes out of sheer need, yet refuse to admit 
their own poverty by evasively naming their cheap but sound 
sauces and sweets after some mythical "Poor Man" who couldn't 
possibly be they themselves. 

So here's an ancient sample of about as flossy a billionaire sauce 
as can be thrown together: 

Take red wine, gravy, sweet herbs, and spice, in which toss up 
lamb stones, cockscombs boiled, blanched and sliced, with sliced 
sweetbreads, oysters, mushrooms, truffles, and morels; thicken 
these with brown butter, and use it occasionally when wanted to 
enrich a ragout of any sort.

And in contrast, here are some classic Proletarian Puddings;

POOR MAN'S PUDDING (2) 

Cut a roll into thin slices, leaving the crust on; pour over them i 
pint of milk mixed with two beaten eggs and a small quantity of 
sugar and grated nutmeg. Let the slices soak in this custard for an 
hour, pour it off, and let them drain for an hour; then fry them 
brown, and serve hot with wine sauce. 

POOR MAN'S PUDDING (3) 

Take some stale bread; pour over it some hot water, till it is well 
soaked; then press out the water and wash the bread; add some 
powdered ginger, nutmeg grated, and a little salt; some rose water 
or sack, some sugar, and some currants; mix them well together, and 
lay it in a pan well buttered on the sides; and when it is well flatted 
with a spoon, lay some pieces of butter on top; bake it in a gentle 
oven, and serve it hot. You may turn it out of the pan when it is 
cold, and it will eat like a fine cheesecake.

AN UMBLE PIE 

Take the humbles of a buck, boil them, chop them as small as

apples, half a pound of sugar, a pound and a half of currants, a 
little salt, some mace, cloves, nutmeg, and a little pepper; then 
mix them together into a paste; add half a pint of sack, the juice 
of one lemon and orange, close the pie, and when it is baked, 
serve it up. 

POOR MAN'S SAUCE (i) 

Pick a handful of parsley leaves from the stalks, mince them 
very fine, strew over a little salt; shred fine half a dozen young 
green onions, add these to the parsley, and put them in a sauce- 
boat, with three tablespoon fuls of oil, and five of vinegar; add some 
ground black pepper and salt; stir together and send it up. 

Pickled French beans or gherkins, cut fine, may be added, or a 
little horseradish. 

This recipe, from Dr. Kitchiner*s Cook*s Oracle^ more than a cen- 
tury old, has the added observation: "This sauce is in much esteem 
in France, where people of taste, weary of rich dishes, to obtain the 
charm of variety, occasionally order the plain fare of the peasant." 

In Dr. Kitchiner's day the rich were supposed to have different 
tasters from the poor and that swanky line of his — "and send it 
up'* refers to the wife or slavy who cooked in a basement scullery 
and "sent it up" to master or husband by some under-slavy, 
usually a child, to the dining room on the main floor. And even to- 
day England clings to the scullery and slavy, which sharply di- 
vides both the sexes and the "clawses." Indeed, an English woman 
of any "rank" is supposed to shine her husband's shoes.

XXIX. "JVe Dine for the Poor 



^^ 



In "Old Cookery Books" W. C. Hazlitt tells how a farm owner 
in Shakespeare's time indulged his ** hinds" by feeding them some 
of the meat they fattened for him, twice a week, on Sunday and 
Thursday, which of course is much more than the modern share- 
cropper gets. But Hazlitt says this was exceptionally good treat- 
ment and gives us quaint culinary news from another food writer, 
Tobias Venner, who shook a mean quill in the time of "Good 
Queen Bess": 

Venner considered two meals a day sufficient for all ordinary people, 
— breakfast at eleven and supper at six (as at the universities); but 
he thought that children and the aged or infirm could not be tied to 
any rule. He condemns "bull's beef" as rank, unpleasant, and indi- 
gestible, and holds it best for the laborer; which seems to indicate 
more than anything else the low state of knowledge in the grazier, 
when Venner wrote: but there is something beyond friendly counsel 
where our author dissuades the poor from eating partridges, because 
they are calculated to promote asthma. "Wherefore," he ingeniously 
says, "when they shall chance to meet with a covey of young par- 
tridges, they were much better to bestow them upon such, for whom 
they are convenient." 

And all the way through culinary literature we find this idea per- 
sisting: that the fat of the land is far too good for the people who 

213 



2l4 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

produce it. Workers, until recently, were supposed to have different 
tasters and partridges have always been considered too rich for 
their blood. This line of unreasoning was established by gormandiz- 
ing medieval monks who spent most of their waking hours sampling 
special dishes and brews, roUing their eyes and patting their stom- 
achs, while they purred, "Ah, this is much too good for the laity." 
To be sure, these charitable priests gave beer and black bread to 
pilgrims who tottered starving to their gates, but it was a cheaply 
brewed "small beer" handed out with "coarse" bread while they 
regaled themselves on specially brewed "strong beer" with fancy 
cakes, and even in the Lenten season brotherly cooks smuggled 
into their refectories great dishes of forbidden meat camouflaged 
under coverings of fish, which made chance penitents think the 
fathers were keeping their fast honestly. 

We still have traces of the best-being-none-too-good-for-the- 
clergy in poor women who save a drop of good drink they can't 
afford to taste themselves to give to the priest when he comes to 
pray with them. And among Protestants the Sunday chicken dinner 
for the minister is an established custom, with the wishbone for 
him and the backbone for the family, who subsist on corned beef 
the rest of the week. All of which parallels the practice in darkest 
Africa where the medicine men get free beer parties to keep them 
from casting the evil eye on tribal herbs. 

The low food standards of English workers in 1750 is recorded in 
the preface to Mrs. Glasse's cookbook where, for the first time, she 
points to the great gulf between the diets of the classes and tells of 
difficulties she encountered in an "attempt to instruct the lower 
sort": 

For example, when I bid them lard a fowl, if I should bid them lard 
with large lardoons they would not know what I meant; but when I 
say they must lard with little pieces of Bacon, they know what I 
mean. 

In spite of this, during the craft period "the labourers dyet" is 
recorded as " Milk, butter and cheese .... and a pot of good Beer 
quickens his spirits." On the other hand, a survey of today's work- 
er's diet in the New York "Times says he can't afford to buy milk, 



**WE DINE FOR THE POOR*' 215 

but subsists on pork and cereals, while nothing is said about the 
bad beer, now made with rice to give it a cheap kick, for which he 
pays a dime a glass. This looks like Liberty League propaganda, 
but it serves.to remind us of Hoover's failure to provide "two chick- 
ens in every pot," a failure everlastingly recorded in the name 
"Hoover hog" for the armadillo on which depression residents in 
Mexican-border Hoovervilles sub-subsist. 

It is true also that the majority of dispossessed farmers, especially 
in the South, don't even get the pork, but exist on unappetizing 
cornmeal mush which they call **hushpuppy" because it attempts 
to still the inward cries of hunger. And Erskine Caldwell has shown 
us whole populations of 100% Americans who are down to a diet 
of grubs and clay. Likewise the grasshopper ravages have driven 
Western farmers to eating that pest which has left them nothing 
else to feed on, even as Chinese coolies were driven to making sweet- 
meats of roast locust thousands of years ago. And while baked 
grasshoppers are a genuine addition to our national menu, the same 
as cooked crows in the corn belt, the obvious objection to both is 
that there's nothing else to vary the monotony of the diet. It 
smacks of the enlisted Navy man's bean song, with the melancholy 
refrain, "All American mothers, I want to say to you, Monday 
b-e-a-n-s, Tuesday s-o-o-u-p, Wednesday b-e-a-n-s — all American 
mothers, I want to say to you!" 

For it doesn't matter how great a delicacy any food is, too much 
of it is plenty — as is eloquently proved by early laws which for- 
bade voracious Southern planters feeding their slaves terrapin more 
than twice a week and likewise shad and shad roe, both of which 
are expensive delicacies today but used to be so common they were 
shoveled out as the cheapest food, costing the owner nothing be- 
yond the labor of bringing them in by the ton. 

But now that the organization of labor is helping the toiler enjoy 
more of the fruits of his own production, there's no fear of his ever 
again slipping back to abjectly taking a repulsive diet lying down. 

"COOKERY FOR THE POOR" 

Passing from Shakespearean times to our revolutionary war 
period, let us observe the illuminating "General Remarks and 



21 6 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

Hints" in A New System of Domestic Cookery, formed upon princi- 
ples of economy; and adapted to the use of private families through- 
out the United States^ published in i8cx) and signed significantly 
"By a Lady." 

I promised a few hints, to enable every family to assist the poor 
of their neighborhood at a very trivial expense; and these may be 
varied or amended at the discretion of the mistress. 

Where cows are kept, a jug of skimmed milk is a valuable present, 
and a very common one. 

When the oven is hot, a large pudding may be baked, and given to 
a sick or young family; and thus made that trouble is little: Into a 
deep coarse pan put half a pound of rice, four ounces of coarse sugar 
or molasses, two quarts of milk, and two ounces of drippings; set it 
cold into the oven. It will take a good while, but be an excellent solid 
food. 

A very good meal may be bestowed in a thing called brewis which 
is thus made: Cut a very thick crust of bread, and put it into the pot 
where salt beef is boiling and near ready: it will attract some of the 
fat, and when swelled out, will be no unpalatable dish to those who 
rarely taste meat. 

Although brewis brings up thoughts of hearty Scotch days when 
"the top of the pot and tail of the herring" were the choice servings 
reserved for the head of the house, this thin pot is more reminiscent 
of the Irish potato famine when a cold potato and a glass of 
buttermilk was almost a banquet. Our "lady" authoress considered 
a crust of bread soaked in the salt pork scum, that otherwise would 
have been skimmed off and thrown away, as a "thing" plenty good 
enough for "those who rarely taste meat." 

"A jug oi skimmed m\\k" and a "coarse" pudding, made with 
little trouble and "trivial expense" puts us in mind of Mrs. Hearst's 
milk fund charities, the milk of human kindness of Borden and 
Sheffield and the lousy bread lines maintained by the charitable 
ladies and gents down to this day. 

But we can't leave this "lady" writer of 1800 without quoting 
her admonition about the staff of life: 

Bread is now so heavy an article of expense that all waste should be 
guarded against, and having it cut in the (dining) room will tend much 



WE DINE FOR THE POOR 217 

to prevent it; since the scarcity in 1795 and 1800, that custom has 
been much adopted. 

From this we see that the poor were crying for bread just after 
the Revolution even as they were under the queen who said **Let 
'em eat cake" and later under Mayor Walker who brought that 
wisecrack up to date. Obviously, the cookbook- writing "lady" 
warns against the "waste" of bread that might come about through 
some starving Jean Valjean helping himself to a heel in the pantry. 
Yet her advice about cutting the loaf in person comes handy in this 
day when baking trusts get away with twelve cents a loaf and take 
care to slice it as thick as they can, to make sure that we'll waste 
enough of every loaf to insure a 12% dividend for them. They cut 
the end crusts a little closer, to make them too awkward to eat, and 
as a result most of them are thrown away. So, in spite of the mod- 
ern convenience of pre-cut bread, which, by the way, even a Gov- 
ernment Bulletin warns us against, those of us who can't afford 
any waste and really know the taste of fresh bread will buy loaves 
whole and slice them in person, as needed. 

It was not until the year 1823 that anybody spoke up in a cook- 
book for the vast majority of all eaters, the Have-nots. This was in 
William Cobbett's Cottage Economy: 

I am strongly disposed to believe that the manufacture, the estab- 
lishment of which I am endeavoring to promote, will be beneficial 
to my country in many respects, and particularly, that it will tend 
to better the lot of the laboring classes; to cause them to live better 
than they now live; to give them better food and better raiment than 
they now have; and to assist in driving from their minds the effects 
of that pernicious and despicable cant which has long been dinning 
into their ears, that hungry bellies and ragged backs are marks of the 
grace of God. 

And such brave words have not appeared in the thousands of 
cookbooks that have gone under the bridge since. Practically all of 
which are written for the Haves, in the elegant style of that famous 
French chef Soyer who gave his whole culinary genius to keeping 
Queen Victoria well-fattened. Contrast Cobbett's honest, human 
expression with this high-sounding bunk from Soyer's Pantropheon: 



21 8 MOST-FOR-YOUR-MONEY COOK BOOK 

The Greeks and Romans — egotists, if there ever were any — 
supped for themselves, and lived only to sup; our pleasures are en- 
nobled by views more useful and more elevated. We often dine for the 
poor, and we sometimes dance for the afflicted, the widow, and the 
orphan. 

Soyer*s "we" is purely rhetorical, for by it he means the Dukes 
and Duchesses, Ducks and Drakes who were his patrons about a 
century ago. They, not he, held charity dances and banquets where 
the "quality" danced and ate "for the poor" — while Soyer and 
his working class stood well outside that classy circle, content 
with the Lord's Cold Potato, the io% for charity which the Lords 
and Ladies dispensed to calm their consciences. 

But from merely bending the knee in his Pantropheon Soyer gets 
right down and grovels on the ground in another cookbook grandly 
called 'The Gastronomic Regenerator. Its dedication is topped with 
the royal arms of his patron. The Duke of Cambridge, consisting 
of crowned lions, knight's armor, a unicorn and Dieu et mon Droit, 
as well as Honi soit qui mal y pense: 

To His Royal Highness 
'The Duke of Cambridge 
Your Royal Highness, 

The gracious condescension which permits of the dedication of 
this Work to your Royal Highness, adds another of the many claims 
upon my devotedness and my gratitude. 
I have the high honour to be 

Your Royal Highness* 
Most obedient and humble Servant 

Alexis Soyer. 

But Soyer doesn't stop there, he goes into one of those fanciful- 
literary recipes which have been popular with patrons and poten- 
tates since the time of Caesar, giving the following ingredients for 
making "The Celestial and Terrestrial Cream of Great Britain." 

" Procure, if possible, the antique Vase of the Roman Capitol . . . 
(on the glittering rim of which three doves are resting in peace), 
and in it deposit a Smile from the Duchess of Sutherland; then add a 
Lesson from the Duchess of Northumberland ... an invitation 



**WE DINE FOR THE POOR*' 2I9 

from the Marchioness of Exeter ... a reception from the Duchess of 
Leinster; an Autocratic Thought from the Baroness Brunow . . . 
the protection of the Countess of St. Aulaire . . . the SylphHke 
form of the Marchioness of Abercorn; a Soiree of the Duchess of 
Beaufort; a Reverence of the Viscountess Jocelyn; and the good-will 
of Lady Palmerston. 

Season with the Piquante Observation of the Marchioness of Lon- 
donderry; the Stately Mien of the Countess of Jersey; the Tresor 
of the Baroness Rothschild; the Noble Devotion of Lady Sale. . . . 

Amalgamate scientifically; and should you find (it) does not mix 
well, do not regard the expense for the completion of a dish worthy 
of the Gods! 

Endeavor to procure, no matter at what price, a Virtuous Maxim 
from the Book of Education of Her Royal Highness the Duchess of 
Kent; a Kiss from the Infant Princess Alice; an Innocent Trick of 
the Princess Royal; a Benevolent Visit from the Duchess of Cambridge 
. . . and the Munificence of Her Majesty Queen Adelaide. 

Cover the Vase with the Reign of Her Most Gracious Majesty, 
and let it simmer for half a century, or more, if possible, over a Fire 
of Immortal Roses. 

Then uncover, with the greatest care and precision, this Mysterious 
Vase; garnish the top with the Aurora of ?. Spring Morning; several 
Rays of the Sun of France; the Serenity of an Italian Sky; and the 
Universal Appreciation of the Peace of Europe. 

Add a few Beams of the Aurora Borealis; sprinkle over with the 
Virgin Snow of Mount Blanc; glaze with the Eruption of Mount 
Vesuvius; cause the Star of the Shepherd to dart over it; and remove, 
as quickly as possible, this chef-d'oeuvre; of the nineteenth Century 
from the Volcanic District. 

But in 1937 this all sounds very indigestible, for times have 
changed. Perhaps the poor, including writers of cookbooks, won't 
always be with us. We leave you with those pleasant possibilities 
to gnaw on and hope to pass along others as we grow older and you 
grow wiser.

THE BROWNS are undoubt- 
edly the most interesting family of cookbook 
writers in America. They are authors of those 
popular culinary guides, THE WINE COOK 
BOOK, THE COUNTRY COOK BOOK, 
and TEN THOUSAND SNACKS. 

The Browns are a versatile group. Cora 
Brown has written short stories for well- 
known English and American magazines; 
has published the Brazilian American maga- 
zine and Mexican American together with 
Bob and Rose Brown. She is author of The 
Guide to Rio de Janeiro and co-author of 
four cookbooks. 

Rose Brown, teacher, interior decorator 
and journalist, is now contributing articles 
on cooking to Colliers, Vogue, This Week, 
etc. 

Bob Brown has appeared in several an- 
thologies, among them Rebel Poets, Atneri- 
cans Abroad, New Caravan, etc. and has 
written editorials for The Masses (now the 
New Masses), Brazilian American, Mexican 
American, British American, and many other 
magazines. H. L. Mencken recently said: 
"All I know about beer is what I read in 
Bob Brown's book."
