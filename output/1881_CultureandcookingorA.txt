PEEFACE 



This is not a cookery book. It makes no attempt to 
replace a good one ; it is rather an effort to fill up the 
gap between you and your household oracle, whether 
she be one of those exasperating old friends who mad- 
dened our mother with their vagueness, or the newer 
and better lights of our own generation, the latest and 
best of all being a lady as well known for her novels as 
for her works on domestic economy — one more proof, if 
proof were needed, of the truth I endeavor to set forth 
— if somewhat tediously forgive me — in this little book : 
that cooking and cultivation are by no means antagonis- 
tic. Who does not remember with affectionate admira- 
tion Charlotte Bronte taking the eyes out of the pota- 
toes stealthily, for fear of hurting the feelings of her 
purblind old servant ; or Margaret Fuller shelling peas ? 

The chief difficulty, I fancy, with women trying 
recipes is, that they fail and know not why they fail, 
and so become discouraged, and this is where I hope 
to step in. But although this is not a cookery book, 
insomuch as it does not deal chiefly with recipes, I shall 
yet give a few ; but only when they are, or I believe

things little known, or supposed to belong to the do- 
main of a French chef, of which I have introduced a 
good many. Should I succeed in making things that 
were obscure before clear to a few women, I shall be as 
proud as was Mme. de Genlis when she boasts in her 
Memoirs that she has taught six new dishes to a Ger- 
man housewife. Six new dishes ! When Brillat-Sava- 
rin says : ^' He who has invented one new dish has 
done more for the pleasure of mankind than he who has 
discovered a star."

CULTUEE AND CoOKIKG, 



CHAPTER I. 

A FEW PBELIMINABY REMARKS. 

ALEXA"NrDRE DuMAS, pere, after writing five hundred 
novels, says, '* I wisli to close my literary career with a 
book on cooking." 

And in the hundred pages or so of preface — or perhaps 
overture would be the better word, since in it a group 
of literary men, while contributing recondite recipes, 
flourish trumpets in every key — to his huge volume he 
says, " I wish to be read by people of the world, and 
practiced by people of the art " (gens de Vart) ; and al- 
though / wish, like every one who writes, to be read by 
all the world, I wish to aid the practice, not of the pro- 
fessors of the culinary art, but those whose aspirations 
point to an enjoyment of the good things of life, but 
whose means of attaining them are limited. 

There is a great deal of talk just now about cooking ; 
in a lesser degree it takes its place as a popular topic 
with ceramics, modern antiques, and household art. The 
fact of it being in a mild way fashionable may do a lit- 
tle good to the eating world in general. And it may 
make it more easy to convince young women of refined 
1 1 



2 Culture and Cooking. 

proclivities tliat the art of cooking is not beneath their 
attention, to know that the Queen of England's daugh- 
ters—and of course the cream of the London fair — have 
attended the lectures on the subject delivered at South 
Kensington, and that a young lady of rank. Sir James 
Coles's daughter, has been recording angel to the asso- 
ciation, is in fact the R. 0. 0. who edits the *' Official 
Handbook of Cookery." 

But, notwithstanding all that has been done by South 
Kensington lectures in London and Miss Corson's Cook- 
ing School in New York to popularize the culinary art, 
one may go into a dozen houses, and find the ladies of 
the family with sticky fingers, scissors, and gum pot, 
busily porcelainizing clay jars, and not find one where 
they are as zealously trying to work out the problems of 
the "Official Handbook of Cookery." 

I have nothing to say against the artistic distractions 
of the day. Anything that will induce love of the beau- 
tiful, and remove from us the possibility of a return to 
the horrors of hair-cloth andbrocatel and crochet tidies, 
will be a stride in the right direction. But what I do 
protest against, is the fact, that the same refined girls 
and matrons, who so love to adorn their houses that they 
will spend hours improving a pickle jar, mediae vali zing 
their furniture, or decorating the dinner service, will 
shirk everything that pertains to the preparation of food 
as dirty, disagreeable drudgery, and sit down to a com- 
monplace, ill-prepared meal, served on those artistic 
plates, as complacently as if dainty food were not a re- 
finement ; as if heavy rolls and poor bread, burnt or 
greasy steak, and wilted potatoes did not smack of the 
shanty, just as loudly as coarse crockery or rag carpet — 
indeed far more so ; the carpet and crockery may be due 



A Few Preliminary Remarks. 3 

to poverty, but a dainty meal or its reverse will speak 
volumes for innate refinement or its lack in the woman 
who serves it. You see by my speaking of rag carpets 
and dainty meals in one breath, that I do not consider 
good things to be the privilege of the rich alone. 

There are a great many dainty things the household 
of small or moderate means can have just as easily as 
the most wealthy. Beautiful bread — light, white, crisp , 
— costs no more than the tough, thick-crusted boulder, 
with cavities like eye-sockets, that one so frequently 
meets with as home-made bread. As Hood says: 

" Who has not met with home-made bread, 
A heavy compound of putty and lead ?** 

Delicious coffee is only a matter of care, not expense — 
and indeed in America the cause of poor food, even in a 
boarding-house, is seldom in the quality of the articles 
so much as in the preparation and selection of them — 
yet an epicure can breakfast well with fine bread and 
butter and good coffee. And this leads me to another 
thing : many people think that to give too much atten- 
tion to food shows gluttony. I have heard a lady say 
with a tone of virtuous rebuke, when the conversation 
turned from fashions to cooking, " I give very little time 
to cooking, we eat to live only " — which is exactly what 
an animal does. Eating to live is mere feeding. Brillat- 
Savarin, an abstemious eater himself, among other witty 
things on the same topic says, ^' L' animal se repait, 
VJiomme mange, Vhomme d' esprit seul salt manger.'^ 

Nine people out of ten, when they call a man an 
epicure, mean it as a sort of reproach, a man who is 
averse to every-day food, one whom plain fare would 
fail to satisfy ; but Grimod de la Reyniere, the most eel- 



4 Culture and Cooking. 

ebrated gourmet of his day, author of '^ Almanach des 
Gourmands," and authority on all matters culinary of the 
last century, said, "A true epicure can dine well on one 
dish, provided it is excellent of its kind." Excellent, 
that is it. A little care will generally secure to us the 
refinement of having only on the table what is excellent 
of its kind. If it is but potatoes and salt, let the salt be 
ground fine, and the potatoes white and mealy. Thack- 
eray says, an epicure is one who never tires of brown 
bread and fresh butter, and in this sense every New 
Yorker who has his rolls from the Brevoort House, and 
uses Darlington butter, is an epicure. There seems to 
me, more mere animalism in wading through a long 
bill of fare, eating three or four indifferently cooked 
vegetables, fish, meat, poultry, each second-rate in qual- 
ity, or made so by bad cooking, and declaring that you 
have dined well, and are easy to please, than there is in 
taking pains to have a perfectly broiled chop, a fine po- 
tato, and a salad, on which any tnie epicure could dine 
well, while on the former fare he would leave the table 
hungry. 

Spenser points a moral for me when he says, speaking 
of the Irish in 1580, " That wherever they found a plot 
of shamrocks or water-cresses they had a feast ;" but there 
were gourmets even among them, for " some gobbled 
the green food as it came, and some picked the faultless 
stalks, and looked for the bloom on the leaf." 

Thus it is, when I speak of ''good living," I do not 
mean expensive living or high living, but living so that 
the table may be as elegant as the dishes on which it is 
served. 

I believe there exists a feeling, not often expressed per- 
haps, but prevalent among young people, that for a lady 



A Few Preliminary Remarks, 5 

to cook with her own hands is Yulgar; to love to do it 
shows that she is of low intellectual caliber, a sort of 
drawing-room Bridget. When or how this idea arose it 
would be difficult to say, for in the middle ages cooks 
were often noble ; a Montmorency was chef de cuisine to 
Philip of Valois ; Montesquieu descended, and was not 
ashamed of his descent, from the second cook of the 
Connetable de Bourbon, who ennobled him. And from 
Lord Bacon, "brightest, greatest, meanest of mankind," 
who took, it is said, great interest in cooking, to Talley- 
rand, the Machiavelli of France, who spent an hour every 
day with his cook, we find great men delighting in the 
art as a recreation. 

It is surprising that such an essentially artistic people 
as Americans should so neglect an art which a great 
French writer calls the *' science mignonne of all dis- 
tinguished men of the world." Napoleon the Great so 
fully recognized the social value of keeping a good table 
that, although no gourmet himself, he wished all his 
chief functionaries to be so. "Keep a good table," he 
told them ; "if you get into debt for it I will pay." 
And later, one of his most devoted adherents, the Mar- 
quis de Cussy, out of favor with Louis XVIII. on 
account of that very devotion, found his reputation as 
a gourmet very serviceable to him. A friend applied 
for a plaoe at court for him, which Louis refused, till he 
heard that M. de Cussy had invented the mixture of 
cream, strawberries, and champagne, when he granted 
the petition at once. Nor is this a solitary instance in 
history where culinary skill has been a passport to for- 
tune to its possessor. Savarin relates that the Cheva- 
lier d'Aubigny, exiled from France, was in London, in 
utter poverty, notwithstanding which, by chance, he was 



6 Culture and Cooking, 

invited to dine at a tavern frequented by the young bucks 
of that day. 

After he had finished his dinner, a party of young 
gentlemen, who had been observing him from their table, 
sent one of their number with many apologies and ex- 
cuses to beg of him, as a son of a nation renowned for 
their salads, to be kind enough to mix theirs for them. 
He complied, and while occupied in making the salad, 
told them frankly his story, and did not hide his pov- 
erty. One of the gentlemen, as they parted, slipped a 
five-pound note into his hand, and his need of it was so 
great that he did not obey the prompting of his pride, 
but accepted it. 

A few days later he was sent for to a great house, and 
learned on his arrival that the young gentleman he had 
obliged at the tavern had spoken so highly of his salad 
that they begged him to do the same thing again. A 
very handsome sum was tendered him on his departure, 
and afterwards he had frequent calls on his skill, until 
it became the fashion to have salads prepared by d'Au- 
bigny, who became a well-known character in London, 
and was called '' the fashionable salad-maker T In a few 
years he amassed a large fortune by this means, and 
was in such request that his carriage would drive from 
house to house, carrying him and his various condiments 
— for ■ he took with him everything that could give 
variety to his concoctions — from one place, where his 
services were needed, to another. 

The contempt for this art of cooking is confined to this 
country, and to the lower middle classes in England. By 
the " lower middle classes" I mean, what Carlyle terms 
thegigocracy— ?'.e., people sufficiently well-to-do to keep a 
gig or phaeton — well-to-do tradesmen, small professional 



A Few Preliminary Remarks. 7 

men, the class whose womenkind would call themselves 
''genteel," and many absurd stories are told of the 
determined ignorance and pretense of these would-be 
ladies. But in no class above this is a knowledge of 
cooking a thing to be ashamed of ; in England, indeed, 
so far from that being the case, indifference to the sub- 
ject, or lack of understanding and taste for certain dishes 
is looked upon as a sort of proof of want of breeding. 
Not to like curry, macaroni, or parmesan, pate de fois 
gras, mushrooms, and such like, is a sign that you have 
not been all your life accustomed to good living. Mr. 
Hardy, in his " Pair of Blue Eyes," cleverly hits this 
prejudice when he makes Mr. Swancourt say, *'Iknew 
the fellow wasn't a gentleman; he had no acquired tastes, 
never took Worcestershire sauce." 

Abroad many women of high rank and culture de- 
vote a good deal of time to a thorough understanding 
of the subject. We have a lady of the " lordly line of 
proud St. Clair" writing for us ''Dainty Dishes," and 
doing it with a zest that shows she enjoys her work, 
although she does once in a while forget something she 
ought to have mentioned, and later still we have Miss 
Rose Coles writing the "Official Handbook of Cookery." 

But it is in graceful, refined France that cookery is 
and has been, a pet art. Any bill of fare or French 
cookery book will betray to a thoughtful reader the at- 
tention given to the subject by the wittiest, gayest, and 
most beautiful women, and the greatest men. The high- 
sounding names attached to French standard dishes are 
no mere caprice or homage of a French cook to the great in 
the land, but actually point out their inventor. Thus 
Bechamel was invented by the Marquis de Bechamel, as 
a sauce for codfish ; while Filets de La^pcreau a la 



8 Culture and Cooking. 

Berry were invented by the Duchess de Berry, daughter 
of the regent Orleans, who himself invented Fain a la 
d"* Orleans, while to Richelieu we are indebted for hun- 
dreds of dishes besides the renowned mayonnaise. 

Cailles a la Mirepois, Chartreuse a la Mauconseil, 
Poulets a la Villeroy, betray the tastes of the three great 
ladies whose name they bear. 

But not in courts alone has the art had its devotees. 
Almost every great name in French literature brings to 
mind something its owner said or did about cooking. 
Dumas, who was a prince of cooks, and of whom it is 
related that in 1860, when living at Yarennes, St. Maur, 
dividing his time, as usual, between cooking and litera- 
ture (LorsquHl ne faisait pas sauter un roman, il 
faisait sauter des petits oignons), on Mount joye, a 
young artist friend and neighbor, going to see him, he 
cooked dinner for him. Going into the poultry yard, 
after donning a white apron, he wrung the neck of a 
chicken; then to the kitchen garden for vegetables, 
which he peeled and washed himself ; lit the fire, got 
butter and flour ready, put on his saucepans, then cooked, 
stirred, tasted, seasoned until dinner time. Then he 
entered in triumph, and announced, ^' Le diner est 
servi." For six months he passed three or four days a 
week cooking for Mountjoye. This novelist's book says, 
in connection with the fact that great cooks in France 
have been men of literary culture, and literary men often 
fine cooks, *' It is not surprising that literary men have 
always formed the entourage of a great chef, for, to 
appreciate thoroughly all there is in the culinary art, 
none are so well able as men of letters; accustomed as 
they are to all refinements, they can appreciate better 
than others those of the table," thus paying himself and 



A Few Preliminary Remarks. 9 

confreres a delicate little compliment at the expense of 
the non-literary world; but, notwithstanding the naive 
self-glorification, he states a fact that helps to point my 
moral, that indifference to cooking does not indicate re- 
finement, intellect, or social pre-eminence. 

Brillat-Savarin, grave judge as he was, and abstemi- 
ous eater, yet has written the book of books on the art 
of eating. It was he who said, " Tell me what you eat, 
I will tell you what you are," as pregnant with truth as 
the better-known proverb it paraphrases. 

Malherbe loved to watch his cook at work. I think it 
was he who said, *' A coarse-minded man could never be 
a cook," and Charles Baudelaire, the Poe of France, takes 
a poet's view of our daily wants, when he says, *' that an 
ideal cook must have a great deal of the poet's nature, 
combining something of the voluptuary with the man 
of science learned in the chemical principles of matter;" 
although he goes further than we care to follow when 
he says, that the question of sauces and seasoning re- 
quires " a chapter as grave as ^feuilleton de science." 

It has been said by foreigners that Americans care 
nothing for the refinements of the table, but I think 
they do care. I have known many a woman in com- 
fortable circumstances long to have a good table, many 
a man aspire to better things, and if he could only get 
them at home would pay any money. But the getting 
them at home is the difficulty ; on a table covered with 
exquisite linen, glass, and silver, whose presiding queen 
is more likely than not a type of the American lady — 
graceful, refined, and witty — on such a table, with such 
surroundings, will come the plentiful, coarse, common- 
place dinner. 

The chief reason for this is lack of knowledge on the 
1* 



lO Culture and Cooking. 

part of our ladies: know how to do a thing yourself, and 
you will get it well done by others. But how are many 
of them to know ? The daughters of the wealthy in 
this country often marry struggling men, and they know 
less about domestic economy than ladies of the higher 
ranks abroad; not because English or French ladies take 
more part in housekeeping, but because they are at home 
all their lives. Ladies of the highest rank never go to a 
boarding or any other school, and these are the women 
who, with some few exceptions, know best how things 
should be done. They are at home listening to criti- 
cisms from papa, who is an epicure perhaps, on the 
shortcomings of his own table, or his neighbors'; from 
mamma, as to what the soup lacks, why cook is not a 
^^ cordon Ueu" etc., while our girls are at school, far 
away from domestic comments, deep in the agonies of 
algebra perhaps ; and directly they leave school, in many 
cases they marry. As a preparation for the state of 
matrimony most of them learn how to make cake and 
preserves, and the very excellence of their attainments 
in that way proves how easy it would be for them, with 
their dainty fingers and good taste, to far excel their Eu- 
ropean cousins in that art which a French writer says is 
based on '^reason, health, common sense, and sound taste." 
Here let me say, I do not by any means advocate a 
woman, who can afford to pay a first-rate cook, avoiding 
the expense by cooking herself ; on the contrary, I think 
no woman is justified in doing work herself that she has 
the means given her to get done by employing others. 
I have no praise for the economical woman, who, from 
a desire to save, does her own work without necessity for 
economy. It is not her work; the moment she can afford 
to employ others it is the work of some less fortunate per- 



A Few Preliminary Remarks, li 

son. But in this country, it often happens that a good 
cook is not to be found for money, although the raw ma- 
terial of which one might be made is much oftener at 
hand. And if ladies would only practice the culinary art 
with as much, nay, half as much assiduity as they give to 
a new pattern in crochet ; devote as much time to attain- 
ing perfection in one dish or article of food, be it per- 
fect bread, or some French dish which father, brother, 
or husband goes to Delmonico's to enjoy, as they do to 
the crochet tidies or embroidered rugs with which they 
decorate their drawing-rooms, they could then take the 
material, in the shape of any ambitious girl they may 
meet with, and make her a fine cook. In the time they 
take to make a dozen tidies, they would have a dozen 
dishes at their fingers' ends; and let me tell you, the 
woman who can cook a dozen things, outside of pre- 
serves, in a perfect manner is a rarity here, and a good 
cook anywhere, for, by the time the dozen are accom- 
plished, she will have learned so much of the art of cook- 
ing that all else will come easy. One good soup, bouil- 
lon, and you have the foundation of all others ; two 
good sauces, white sauce and brown, ^'les sauces meres " 
as the French call them (mothers of all other sauces), 
and all others are matters of detail. Leam to make one 
kind of roll perfectly, as light, plump, and crisp as 
Delmonico's, and all varieties are at your fingers' ends; 
you can have kringles, Vienna rolls, Kreuznach horns, 
Yorkshire tea cakes, English Sally Lunns and Bath 
buns ; all are then as easy to make as common soda bis- 
cuit. In fact, in cooking, as in many other things, " ce 
rCest que le premier jJCis que coiite; " failures are almost 
certain at the beginning, but a failure is often a step 
toward success — if we only know the reason of the failure. 



CHAPTER 11. 

OK BREAD. 

Of all articles of food, bread is perhaps the one about 
which most has been written, most instruction given, 
and most failures made. Yet what adds more to the 
elegance of a table than exquisite bread or breads, and 
— unless you live in a large city and depend on the baker 
— what so rare ? A lady who is very proud of her table, 
and justly so, said to me quite lately, " I cannot under- 
stand how it is we never have really fine home-made 
bread. I have tried many recipes, following them 
closely, and I can't achieve anything but a common- 
place loaf with a thick, hard crust ; and as for rolls, 
they are my despair. I have wasted eggs, butter, and 
patience so often that I have determined to give them 
up, but a fine loaf I will try for." 

'* And when you achieve the fine loaf, you may revel 
in home-made rolls, " I answered. 

And so I advise every one first to make perfect bread, 
light, white, crisp, and thin-crusted, that rarest thing 
in home-made bread. 

I have read over many recipes for bread, and am con- 
vinced that when the time allowed for rising is specified, 
it is invariably too short. One standard book directs 
you to leave your sponge two hours, and the bread when 
made up a quarter of an hour. This recipe strictly 
followed must result in heavy, tough bread. As bread 

13 



On Bread, 13 

is so important, and so many fail, I will give my own 
method from beginning to end ; not that there are not 
numberless good recipes, but simply because they fre- 
quently need adapting to circumstances, and altering a 
recipe is one of the things a tyro fears to do. 

I make a sponge over night, using a dried yeast-cake 
soaked in a pint of warm water, to which I add a spoon- 
ful of salt, and, if the weather is warm, as much soda as 
will lie on a dime ; make this into a stiff batter with 
flour — it may take a quart or less, flour varies so much, 
to give a rule is impossible ; but if, after standing, the 
sponge has a watery appearance, make it thicker by 
sprinkling in more flour, beat hard a few minutes, and 
cover with a cloth — in winter keep a piece of thick flan- 
nel for the purpose, as a chill is fatal to your sponge— 
and set in a warm place free from draughts. 

The next morning, when the sponge is quite light— 
that is to say, at least twice the bulk it was, and like a 
honeycomb — take two quarts of flour, more or less, as 
you require, but I recommend at first a small baking, 
and this will make three small loaves ; in winter, flour 
should be dried and warmed ; put it in your mixing 
bowl, and turn the sponge into a hole in the center. 
Have ready some water, rather more than lukewarm, but 
not liot. Add it gradually, stirring your flour into the 
sponge at the same time. The great fault in making 
bread is getting the dough too stiff ; it should be as soft 
as possible, without being at all sticky or wet. Now 
knead it with both hands from all sides into the center ; 
keep this motion, occasionally dipping your hands into 
the flour if the dough sticks, but do not add more flour 
unless the paste sticks very much ; if you have the right 
consistency it will be a smooth mass, very soft to the 



14 Culture and Cooking, 

touch, yet not sticky, but this may not be attained at a 
first mixing without adding flour by degrees. When 
you have kneaded the dough until it leaves the bowl all 
round, set it in a warm place to rise. When it is well 
risen, feels very soft and warm to the touch, and is twice its 
bulk, knead it once more thoroughly, then put it in tins 
either floured, and the flour not adhering shaken out, or 
buttered, putting in each a piece of dough half the size 
you intend your loaf to be. Now everything depends on 
your oven. Many people bake their bread slowly, leav- 
ing it in the oven a long time, and this causes a thick, 
hard crust. When baked in the modern iron oven, 
quick baking is necessary. Let the oven be quite hot, 
then put a little ball of paste in, and if it browns palely 
in seven to ten minutes it is about right ; if it burns, it 
is too hot ; open the damper ten minutes. Your bread, 
after it is in the tins, will rise much more quickly than 
the first time. Let it get light, but not too light — tiuice 
its tuXk is a good rule ; but if it is light before your oven 
is ready, and thus in danger of getting too porous, work 
it down with your hand, it will not harm it, although it 
is better so to manage that the oven waits for the bread 
rather than the bread for the oven. A small loaf — and 
by all means make them small until you have gained 
experience — will not take more than three quarters of an 
hour to bake; when a nice yellow brown, take it out, turn 
it out of the tin into a cloth, and tap the bottom ; if it is 
crisp and smells cooked, the loaf is done. Once the bot- 
tom is brown it need remain no longer. Should that, 
however, from fault of your oven, be not brown, but 
soft and white, you must put it back in the oven, the 
bottom upwards. An oven that does not bake at the 
bottom will, however, be likely to spoil your bread. It 



On Bread. 15 

is sometimes caused by a careless servant leaving a col- 
lection of ashes underneath it ; satisfy yourself that all 
the flues are perfectly clean and clear before beginning 
to bake, and if it still refuses to do its duty, change it, 
for you will have nothing but loss and vexation of spirit 
while you have it in use. I think you will find this 
bread white, evenly porous (not with small holes in one 
part and caverns in another ; if it is so you have made 
your dough too stiff, and it is not sufficiently kneaded), 
and with a thin, crisp crust. Bread will surely fail to 
rise at all if you have scalded the yeast ; the water must 
never be too hot. In winter, if it gets chilled, it will 
only rise slowly, or not at all, and in using baker's or 
German yeast take care that it is not stale, which will 
cause heavy, irregular bread. 

In making bread with compressed yeast proceed in 
exactly the same way, excepting that the sponge will not 
need to be set over night, unless you want to bake very- 
early. 

If you have once produced bread to your satisfaction 
you will find no difficulty in making rolls. Proceed as 
follows : 

Take a piece of the dough from your baking after it 
has risen once. To a piece as large as a man's fist take 
a large tablespoonful of butter and a little powdered 
sugar ; work them into the dough, put it in a bowl, cover 
it, and set it in a warm place to rise— a shelf behind the 
stove is best ; if you make this at the same time as 
your bread, you will find it takes longer to rise ; the 
butter causes that difference; when very light, much 
lighter than your bread should be, take your hand and 
push it down till it is not larger than when you put it 
in the bowl ; let it rise again, and again push it do^vn. 



1 6 Culture and Cooking. 

but not so thoroughly ; do this once or twice more, and 
you have the secret of light rolls. You will find them rise 
very quickly, after once or twice pushing down. When 
they have risen the third or fourth time, take a little 
butter on your hands, and break off small pieces about 
the size of a walnut and roll them round. Either put 
them on a tin close together, to be broken apart, or an 
inch or two from each other, in which case work in a 
little more flour, and cut a cleft on the top, and once more 
set to rise ; half an hour will be long enough generally, 
but in this case you must judge for yourself, they some- 
times take an hour ; if they look swelled very much and 
smooth they will be ready. Have a nice hot oven, and 
bake for twelve to fifteen minutes. 

Add a little more sugar to your dough and an Qgg, go 
through the same process, brush them over with sugar 
dissolved in milk, and you will have delicious rusks. 

The above is my own method of making rolls, and the 
simplest I know of ; but there are numbers of other 
recipes given in cookery books which would be just as 
good if the exact directions for letting them rise were 
given. As a test — and every experiment you try will be 
so much gained in your experience — follow the recipe 
given for rolls in any good cookery book, take part of 
the dough and let it rise as therein directed, and bake, 
set the other part to rise as / direct, and notice the dif- 
ference. 

Keeuzn"ACH Hoeks. — Either take a third of the 
dough made for bread with three quarts of flour, or set 
a sponge with a pint of flour and a yeast-cake soaked in 
half a pint of warm water or milk, making it into a stif- 
fish dough with another pint of flour; then add four 
ounces of butter, a little sugar, and two eggs; work well. 



On Bread, 17 

If you nse the bread dough, you will need to dredge in 
a little more flour on account of the eggs, but not very 
much; then set to rise as for rolls, work it down twice or 
thrice, then turn the dough out on the molding board 
lightly floured, roll it as you would pie-crust into pieces 
six inches square, and quarter of an inch thick, make two 
sharp, quick cuts across it from comer to comer, and you 
will have from each square four three-cornered pieces of 
paste; spread each thinly with soft butter, flour lightly, 
and roll up very lightly from the wide side, taking care 
that it is not squeezed together in any way ; lay them on 
a tin with the side on which the point comes uppermost, 
and bend round in the form of a horseshoe; these will 
take some time to rise; when they have swollen much 
and look light, brush them over with white of Q%g 
(not beaten) or milk and butter, and bake in a good 
oven. 

Kkii^'gles are made from the same recipe, but with 
another o^g'g and two ounces of sugar (powdered) added 
to the dough when first set to rise; then, when well risen 
two or three times, instead of rolling with a pin as for 
horns, break off pieces, roll between your hands as thick 
as your finger, and form into figure eights, rings, fingers; 
or take three strips, flour and roll them as thick as your 
finger, tapering at each end ; lay them on the board, 
fasten the three together at one end, and then lay one 
over the other in a plait, fasten the other end, and set to 
rise, bake; when done, brush over with sugar dissolved in 
milk, and sprinkle with sugar. 

All these breads are delicious for breakfast, and may 
easily be had without excessive early rising if the sponge 
is set in the morning, dough made in the afternoon, 
and the rising and working done in the evening ; when. 



i8 Culture and Cooking. 

instead of making up into rolls, horns, or kringles, pnsh 
the dougli down thoroughly, cover with a damp folded 
cloth, and put in a very cold place if in summer — not on 
ice of course — then next morning, as soon as the fire is 
alight, mold, but do not push down any more, put in a 
yery warm spot, and when light, bake. 

In summer, as I have said, I think it safest, to prevent 
danger of souring, to put a little soda in the sponge for 
bread ; and for rolls, or anything requiring to rise sev- 
eral times, it is an essential precaution. 

Brioche. — I suppose the very name of this delectable 
French dainty will call up in the mind's eye of many 
who read this book that great *^ little" shop, Au Grand 
Brioche, on the Boulevarde Poissoniere, where, on Sun- 
day afternoons, scores of boys from the Lycees form 
en queue with the general public, waiting the hour 
when the piles of golden brioche shall be ready to ex- 
change for their eager sous. But I venture to say, a 
really fine brioche is rarely eaten on this side the Atlan- 
tic. They being a luxury welcome to all, and especially 
aromatic of Paris, I tried many times to make them, 
obtaining for that purpose recipes from French friends, 
and from standard French books, but never succeeded 
in producing the ideal brioche until I met with Gouf- 
fe's great book, the '^ Livre de Cuisine,''^ after reading 
which, I may here say, all secrets of the French kitchen 
are laid bare ; no effort is spared to make everything 
plain, from the humble pot-au-feu to the most gorgeous 
monumental plat. And I would refer any one who wants 
to become proficient in any French dish, to that book, 
feeling sure that, in following strictly the directions, 
there will be no failure. It is the one book I have met 
with on the subject in which no margin is left for your 



On Bread. 19 

own knowledge, if you have it, to fill up. But to the 
brioche. 

PAEIS JOCKEY-CLUB EECIPE FOR BRIOCHE. 

Sift one pound of flour, take one fourth of it, and add 
rather more than half a cake of compressed yeast, dis- 
solved in half a gill of warm water, make into a sponge 
with a very little more water, put it in a warm place ; 
when it is double its volume take the rest of the flour, 
make a hole in the center, and put in it an equal quantity 
of salt and sugar, about a teaspoonful, and two tablespoon- 
fuls of water to dissolve them. Three quarters of a pound 
of butter and four eggs, beat well, then add another egg, 
beat again, and add another, and so on until seven have 
been used ; the paste must be soft, but not spread ; if too 
firm, add another egg. Now mix this paste with the 
sponge thoroughly, beating until the paste leaves the 
sides of the bowl, then put it in a crock and cover ; let 
it stand four hours in a warm place, then turn it out on 
a board, spread it and double it four times, return it to 
the crock, and let it rise again two hours ; repeat the 
former process of doubling and spreading, and put it in 
a very cold place for two hours, or until you want to use 
it. Mold in any form you like, but the true brioche is 
two pieces, one as large again as the other ; form the 
large one into a ball, make a deep depression in the cen- 
ter, on which place the smaller ball, pressing it gently 
in ; cut two or three gashes round it with a sharp knife, 
and bake a beautiful golden brown. These brioche are 
such a luxury, and so sure to come out right, that the 
trouble of making them is well worth the taking, and 
for another reason : every one knows the great difficulty 
of making puff paste in summer, and a short paste is 



20 Culture and Cooking. 

never handsome ; but take a piece of brioclie paste, roll 
it out thin, dredge with flour, fold and roll again, then 
use as you would pulf paste ; if for sweet pastry, a 
little powdered sugar may be sprinkled through it in- 
stead of dredging with flour. This makes a very hand- 
some and delicious crust. Or, another use to which it 
may be put is to roll it out, cut it in rounds, lay on 
them mince-meat, orange marmalade, jam, or merely 
sprinkle with currants, chopped citron, and spices, fold, 
press the edges, and bake. 

Before quitting the subject of breads I must introduce 
a novelty which I will call '^soufflee bread." It is 
quickly made, possible even when the fire is poor, and so 
delicious that I know you will thank me for making 
you acquainted with it. 

Use two or three eggs according to size you wish, and 
to each egg a tablespoonful of flour. Mix the yolks 
with the flour and with them a dessert-spoonful of but- 
ter melted, and enough milk to make a ^eYjtliich batter, 
work, add a pinch of salt and a teaspoonful of sugar, 
work till quite smooth, then add the whites of the eggs 
in a firm froth, stir them in gently, and add a quarter 
teaspoonful of soda and lialf a one of cream of tartar. 
Have ready an iron frying-pan (or an earthen one that 
will stand heat is better), made hot with a tablespoonful 
of butter in it, also hot, but not so hot as for frying. 
Pour the batter (which should be of the consistency of 
sponge cake batter) into the pan, cover it with a lid 
or tin plate, and set it back of the stove if the fire is 
hot — if very slow it may be forward ; when well risen 
and near done, put it in the oven, or if the oven 
is cold you may turn it gently, not to deaden it. 
Serve when done (try with a twig), the under side

uppermost; it should be of a fine golden brown and 
look like an omelet. This soufflee bread is equally- 
good halced in a tin in which is rather more butter than 
enough to grease it ; the oven must be very hot in- 
deed. Cover it for the few minutes with a tin plate or 
lid, to prevent it scorching before it has risen ; when it 
has puffed up remove the lid, and allow it to brown, ten 
to fifteen minutes should bake it ; turn it out as you 
would sponge cake — ^very carefully, not to deaden it. To 
succeed with bread you must use the very best flour. 



CHAPTER III. 

PASTRY. 

To MAKE good puff paste is a thing many ladies are 
anxious to do, and in which they generally fail, and this 
not so much because they do not make it properly, as 
because they handle it badly. A lady who Avas very 
anxious to excel in pastry once asked me to allow her to 
watch me make paste. I did so, and explained that there 
was more in the manner of using than in the making 
up. I then gave her a piece of my paste when com- 
pleted, and asked her to cover some patty pans while I 
covered others, cautioning her as to the way she must 
cover them ; yet, when those covered by her came out 
of the oven they had not risen at all, they were like rich 
short paste ; while my own, made from the same paste, 
were toppling over with lightness. I had, without say- 
ing anything, pressed my thumb slightly on one spot of 
one of mine ; in that spot the paste had not risen at all, 
and I think this practical demonstration of what I had 
tried to explain was more useful than an hour's talk 
would have been. 

I will first give my method of making, which is the 
usual French way of making ^' feuilletonage.''^ Take 
one pound of butter, or half of it lard ; press all the 
water out by squeezing it in a cloth ; this is impor- 
tant, as the liquid in it would wet your paste ; take a 
third of the butter, or butter and lard, and rub it into 

22 



Pastry, 23 

one pound of fine flour ; add no salt if your butter is 
salted ; then take enough water (to which you may add 
the well-beaten white of an ^gg, but it is not absolutely 
necessary) to make the flour into a smooth, firm dough; it 
must not be too stiff, or it will be hard to roll out, or 
too soft, or it will never make good paste ; it should roll 
easily, yet not stick ; work it till it is very smooth, then 
roll it out till it is half an inch thick ; now lay the whole 
of the butter in the center, fold one-third the paste over, 
then the other third ; it is now folded in three, with the 
butter completely hidden ; now turn the ends toward 
you, and roll it till it is half an inch thick, taking care, 
by rolling very evenly, that the butter is not pressed out 
at the other end ; now you have a piece of paste about 
two feet long, and not half that width ; flour it lightly, 
and fold over one third and under one third, which will 
almost bring it to a square again ; turn it round so that 
what was the side is now the end, and roll. Most likely 
now the butter will begin to break through, in which 
case fold it, after flouring lightly, in three, as before, and 
put it on a dish on the ice, covering it with a damp cloth. 
You may now either leave it for an hour or two, or till 
next day. Paste made the day before it is used is much 
better and easier to manage, and in winter it may be kept 
for four or five days in a cold place, using from it as 
required. 

"When ready to use your paste finish the making by 
rolling it out, dredging a little flour, and doubling it in 
three as before, and roll it out thin ; do this until from 
first to last it has been so doubled and rolled seven times. 

Great cooks differ on one or two points in making 
pastry ; for instance, Soyer directs you to put the yolk 
of an ^gg instead of the white, and a squeeze of lemon 



24 Culture ajtd Cooking. 

juice into the flour, and expressly forbids you to work it 
before adding the mass of butter, while Jules Gouffe 
says, **work it until smooth and shining." I cannot 
pretend to decide between these differing doctors, but I 
pursue the method I have given and always have light 
pastry. And now to the handling of it : It must only be 
touched by the lightest fingers, every cut must be made 
with a sharp knife, and done with one quick stroke so that 
the paste is not dragged at all ; in covering a pie dish or 
patty pan, you are commonly directed to mold the paste 
over it as thin as possible, which conveys the idea that the 
paste is to be pressed over and so made thin ; this would 
destroy the finest paste in the world ; roll it thin, say 
for small tartlets, less than a quarter of an inch thick, 
for a pie a trifle thicker, then lay the dish or tin to be 
covered on the paste, and cut out with a knife, dipped in 
hot water or flour, a piece a little larger than the mold, 
then line with the piece you have cut, touching it as little 
as possible ; press only enough to make the paste adhere 
to the bottom, but on no account press the border; to 
test the necessity of avoiding this, gently press one spot 
on a tart, before putting it in the oven, only so much as 
many people always do in making pie, and watch the 
result. When your tartlets or pies are made, take each 
up on your left hand, and with a sharp knife dipped in 
flour trim it round quickly. To make the cover of a 
pie adhere to the under crust, lay the forefinger of your 
right hand lengthwise round the border, but as far from 
the edge as you can, thus forming a groove for the syrups, 
and pressing the cover on at the same time. A word 
here about fruit pies : Pile the fruit high in the center, 
leaving a space all round the sides almost bare of fruit, 
when the cover is on press gently the paste, as I have 



Pastry, 25 

explained, into this groove, then make two or three deep 
holes in the groove ; the juice will boil out of these holes 
and run round this groove, instead of boiling out through 
the edges and wasting. 

This is the pastry-cook's way of making pies, and makes 
a much handsomer one than the usual flat method, 
besides saving your syrup. To ornament fruit pies or 
tartlets, whip the white of an ^gg, and stir in as much 
powdered sugar as will make a thin meringue — a large 
tablespoonful is usually enough — then when your pies or 
tartlets are baked, take them from the oven, glaze with 
the Qgg and sugar, and return to the oven, leaving the 
door open ; when it has set into a frosty icing they are 
ready to serve. 

It is worth while to accomplish puff paste, for so 
many dainty trifles may be made with it, which, at- 
tempted with the ordinary short paste, would be unsight- 
ly. Some of these that seem to me novel I will describe. 

Eissolettes are made with trimmings of puff paste; if 
you have about a quarter of a pound left, roll it out very 
thin, about as thick as a fifty-cent piece; put about half 
a spoonful of marmalade or jam on it, in places about 
an inch apart, wet lightly round each, and place a piece 
of paste over all ; take a small round cutter as large as 
a dollar, and press round the part where the marma- 
lade or jam is with the thick part of the cutter; then cut 
them out with a cutter a size larger, lay them on a bak- 
ing tin, brush over with white of Qgg-, then cut some little 
rings the size of a quarter dollar, put one on each, Qgg 
over again, and bake twenty minutes in a nice hot oven; 
then sift white sugar all over, put them back in the oven 
to glaze ; a little red currant jelly in each ring looks 
pretty ; serve in the form of a pyramid. 



26 Culture and Cooking, 

Pastbt Tablets.— Cut strips of paste three inches 
and a half long, and an inch and a half wide, and as 
thick as a twenty-five cent piece ; lay on half of them 
a thin filmy layer of jam or marmalade, not jelly; then 
on each lay a strip without jam, and bake in a quick 
oven. When the paste is well risen and brown, take 
them out, glaze them with white of ^gg and sugar, 
and sprinkle chopped almonds over them ; return to 
the oven till the glazing is set and the almonds just 
colored; serve them hot or cold on a napkin piled log- 
cabin fashion. 

Feangipan"e Taetlets. — One quarter pint of cream, 
four yolks of eggs, two ounces of flour, three macaroons, 
four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, the peel of a 
grated lemon, and a little citron cut very fine, a little 
brandy and orange-flower water. Put all the ingredi- 
ents, except the eggs, in a saucepan — of course you will 
mix the flour smooth in the cream first — let them 
come to a boil slowly, stirring to prevent lumps ; 
when the flour smells cooked, take it off the fire for 
a minute, then stir the beaten yolks of eggs into it. 
Stand the saucepan in another of boiling water and re- 
turn to the stove, stirring till the eggs seem done — about 
five minutes, if the water boils all the time. Line patty 
pans with puff paste, and fill with frangipane and bake. 
Ornament with chopped almonds and meringue, or not, 
as you please. 

It is very difficult to make fine puff paste in warm 
weather, and almost impossible without ice ; for this 
reason I think the brioche paste preferable; but if it 
is necessary to have it for any purpose, you must take 
the following precautions : 

Have your water iced"; have your butter as firm as 



Pastry. 27 

possible by being kept on ice till the last moment ; make 
the paste in the coolest place you have, and under the 
breeze of an open window, if possible ; make it the day 
before you use it, and put it on the ice between every 
"turn," as each rolling out is technically called; then 
leave it on the ice, as you use it, taking pieces from it as 
you need them, so that the warmth cannot soften the 
whole at once, when it would become quite unmanage- 
able. The condition of the oven is a very important 
matter, and I cannot do better than transcribe the rules 
given by Gouffe, by which you may test its fitness for 
any purpose : 

Put half a sheet of writing paper in the oven; if it 
catches fire it is too hot; open the dampers and wait 
ten minutes, when put in another piece of paper ; if it 
blackens it is still too hot. Ten minutes later put in a 
third piece ; if it gets darh hrown the oven is right for 
all small pastry. Called ''darh hrown paper heaV^ 
Light hrown paper heat is suitable for vol-au-vents or 
fruit pies. Dark yellow paper heat for large pieces of 
pastry or meat pies, pound cake, bread, etc. Light yel- 
low paper heat for sponge cake, meringues, etc. 

To obtain these various degrees of heat, you try paper 
every tsn minutes till the heat required for your purpose 
is attained. But remember that " light yellow " means 
the paper only tinged ; "dark yellow," the paper the 
color of ordinary pine wood; ^Might brown" is only a 
shade darker, about the color of nice pie-crust, and dark 
brown a shade darker, by no means coffee color. 



CHAPTER IV. 

WHAT TO HAVE lif YOUE STOEE-BOOM. 

One great trouble with many young housekeepers is 
betrayed by the common remark, '^ Cookery books al- 
ways require so many things that one never has in the 
house, and they coolly order you to ' moisten with gravy,' 
* take a little gravy,' as if you had only to go to the pump 
and get it." It is very true that economy in cooking is 
much aided by having a supply of various condiments ; 
warmed-over meat may then be converted into a delicious 
little entree with little trouble. I would recommend, 
therefore, any one who is in earnest about reforming 
her dinner table to begin by expending a few dollars in 
the following articles : 



1 bottle of capers, 

1 *' olives, 

1 ** gherkins, 

1 *' soy, 

1 " anchovies, 

1 ** tarragon vinegar. 



bottle of claret, 

** white wine, 

*' sherry for cooking, 

" brandy, 

" Harvey sauce, 

** walnut ketchup. 



And a package of compressed vegetables and a few bay leaves. 

Ten dollars thus spent may seem a good deal of money 
to a young housewife trying to make her husband's salary 
go as far as it will ; but I assure her it is in the end an 
economy, especially in a small family, who are so apt to 
get tired of seeing the same thing, that it has to be 



What to Have in Your Store-room. 29 

thrown or given away. With these condiments and 
others I have yet to mention you will have no trouble 
in using every scrap ; not using it and eating it from a 
sense of duty, and wishing it was something better, but 
enjoying it. With your store-room well provided, you 
can indeed go for gravy **as if to the pump." 

Besides the foregoing list of articles to be bought of 
any good grocer, there are others which can be made at 
home to advantage, and once made are always ready. 
Mushroom powder 1 prefer for any use to mushroom 
catsup ; it is easily made and its uses are infinite. 
Sprinkled over steak (when it must be sifted) or chops, 
it is delicious. For ordinary purposes, such as flavoring 
soup or gravy, it need not be sifted. To prepare it, take 
a peck of large and very fresh mushrooms, look them over 
carefully that they are not wormy, then cleanse them 
with a piece of flannel from sand or grit, then peel them 
and put them in the sun or a cool oven to dry ; they re- 
quire long, slow drjring, and must become in a state to 
crumble. Your peck will have diminished by the pro- 
cess into half a pint or less of mushroom powder, but 
you have the means with it of making a rich gravy at a 
few minutes' notice. 

Apropos of gravies — that much-vexed question in 
small households — for without gravies on hand you can- 
not make good hash, or many other things that are mis- 
erable without, and excellent with it. Yet how difficult 
it is to have gravy always on hand every mistress of a 
small family knows, in spite of the constant advice to 
" save your trimming to make stock." Do by all means 
save your bones, gristle, odds and ends of meat of all 
kinds, and convert them into broth ; but even if you 
do, it often happens that the days you have done so no 



30 Culture and Cooking. 

gravy is required, and then it sours quickly in summer, 
although it may be arrested by reboiling. In no family 
of three or four are there odds and ends enough, unless 
there is a very extravagant table kept, to insure stock for 
every day. My remedy for this, then, is to make a 
stock that will keep for months or years — in other words, 
glaze. So very rarely forming part of a housewife's 
stores, yet so valuable that the fact is simply astonish- 
ing ; with a piece of glaze, you have a dish of soup on 
an emergency, rich gravy for any purpose, and all with 
the expenditure of less time than would make a pot of 
sweetmeats. 

Take six pounds of a knuckle of veal or leg of beef, 
cut it-in pieces the size of an Qgg, as also half a pound 
of lean ham ; then rub a quarter of a pound of butter on 
the bottom of your pot, which should hold two gallons ; 
then put in the meat with half a pint of water, three 
middle-sized onions, with two cloves in each, a turnip, a 
carrot, and a small head of celery ; then place over a 
quick fire, occasionally stirring it round, until the bot- 
tom of the pot is covered with a thick glaze, which will 
adhere lightly to the spoon ; then fill up the pot with 
cold water, and when on the boiling point, draw it to the 
back of the stove, where it may gently simmer three 
hours, if veal, six if beef, carefully skimming it to re- 
move scum. This stock, as it is, will make a delicious 
foundation, with the addition of salt, for all kinds of 
clear soup or gravies. To reduce it to glaze proceed as 
follows : Pass the stock through a fine hair sieve or 
cloth into a pan ; then fill up the pot again with liot 
water, and let it boil four hours longer to obtain all the 
glutinous part from the meat ; strain, and pour both 
stocks in a large pot or stew-pan together ; set it over the 



What to Have in Your Store-room, 31 

fire, and let it boil as fast as possible with the lid ofE, 
leaving a large spoon in it to prevent it boiling over, and 
to stir occasionally. When reduced to about three pints, 
pour it into a small stew-pan or saucepan, set again to 
boil, but more slowly, skimming it if necessary ; when 
it is reduced to a quart, set it where it will again boil 
quickly, stirring it well with a wooden spoon until it 
begins to get thick and of a fine yellowish-brown color ; 
at this point be careful it does not bum. 

You may either pour it into a pot for use, or, what is 
more convenient for making gravies, get a sausage skin 
from your butcher, cut a yard of it, tie one end very 
tightly, then pour into it by means of a large funnel the 
glaze ; from this cut slices for use. A thick slice dis- 
solved in hot water makes a cup of nutritious soup, into 
which you may put any cooked vegetables, or rice, or 
barley. A piece is very useful to take on a journey, 
especially for an invalid who does not want to depend on 
wayside hotel food, or is tired of beef- tea. 

The foregoing is the orthodox recipe for glaze, and if 
you have to buy meat for the purpose the very best way 
in which you can make it ; but if it happen that you 
have some strong meat soup or jelly, for which you have 
no use while fresh, then boil it down till it is thick and 
brown (not burnt) ; it will be excellent glaze ; not so fine 
in flavor, perhaps, but it preserves to good use what 
would otherwise be lost. Very many people do not 
know the value of pork for making jelly. If you live in 
the country and kill a pig, use his hocks for making glaze 
instead of beef. 

Glaze also adds much to the beauty of many dishes. 
If roast beef is not quite brown enough on any one spot 
Bet your jar of glaze — for this purpose it is well to have 



32 Culture and Cooking. 

some put in a jar as well as in the skin — in boiling water. 
Keep a small stiff brush ; such as are sold for the pur- 
pose at house-furnishing stores, called a glazing brush, 
are best ; but you may manage with any other or even a 
stiff feather. When the glaze softens, as glue would do, 
brush over your meat with it, it will give the lacking 
brown ; or, if you have a ham or tongue you wish to 
decorate you may '^varnish" it, as it were, with the 
melted glaze ; then when cold beat some fresh butter to 
a white cream, and with a kitchen syringe, if you have 
one, a stiff paper funnel if you have not, trace any 
design you please on the glazed surface ; this makes a 
very handsome dish, and if your ham has been properly 
boiled will be very satisfactory to the palate. Of the 
boiling of ham I will speak in another chapter. 

I have a few more articles to recommend for your 
store-room, and then I think you will find yourself equal 
to the emergency of providing an elegant little meal if 
called upon unexpectedly, provided you have any cold 
scraps at all in the house, and maitre d'hStel butter. 

To make the latter, take half a pound of fine butter, 
one tablespoonful of very fresh parsley, chopped not too 
fine, salt, pepper, and a small tablespoonful of lemon 
juice ; mix together*, but do not work more than suffi- 
cient for that purpose, and pack in a jar, keeping it in a 
cool place. A tablespoonful of this laid in a hot dish 
on which you serve beefsteak, chops, or any kind of fish, 
is a great addition, and turns plain boiled potatoes into 
pomme de terre a la maitre dliotel. It is excellent with 
stewed potatoes, or added to anything for which parsley 
is needed, and not always at hand ; a spoonful with half 
the quantity of flour stirred into a gill of milk or water 
makes the renowned maitre d'hotel sauce (or English 



What to Have in Your Store-room, 33 

parsley butter) for boiled fish, mutton, or real. In 
short, it is one of the most valuable things to have in 
the house. Equally valuable, even, and more elegant is 
the preparation known as "Ravigotte" or Montpellier 
butter. 

Take one pound in equal quantities of chervil, tarra- 
gon, burnet (pimpernel), chives, and garden cress (pep- 
pergrass) ; scald two minutes, drain quite dry ; pound in 
a mortar three hard eggs, three anchovies, and one scant 
ounce of pickled cucumbers, and same quantity of capers 
well pressed to extract the vinegar ; add salt, pepper, and 
a bit of garlic half as large as a pea, rub all through a 
sieve ; then put ^ pound of fine butter into the mortar, 
which must be well cleansed from the herbs, add the 
herbs, with two tablespoonf uls of oil and one of tarragon 
vinegar, mix perfectly, and if not of a fine green, add 
the juice of some pounded spinach. 

This is the celebrated ^^heurre de Montpellier,^'' sold 
in Paris in tiny jars at a high price. Ravigotte is the 
same thing, only in place of the eggs, anchones, pickles, 
and capers, put half a pound more butter ; it is good, but 
less piquant. 

Pack in a jar, and keep cool. This butter is excel- 
lent for many purposes. For salad, beaten with oil, 
vinegar, and yolks of eggs, as for mayonnaise, it makes 
a delicious dressing. For cold meat or fish it is excel- 
lent, and also for chops. 

Two or three other articles serve to simplify the art of 
cooking in its especially difficult branches, and in the 
branches a lady finds difficult to attend to herself with- 
out remaining in the kitchen until the last minute before 
dinner ; but with the aid of blanc and roux a fairly 
intelligent girl can make excellent sauces. 
2* 



34 Culture and Cooking, 

For roux melt slowly half a pound of butter over the 
fire, skim it, let it settle, then dredge in eight ounces of 
fine flour, stir it till it is of a bright brown, then put 
away in a jar for use. 

Blanc is the same thing, only it is not allowed to 
brown ; it should be stirred only enough to make all hot 
through, then put away in a jar. 

If you need thickening for a white sauce and do not 
wish to stand over it yourself, having taught your cook 
the simple fact that a piece of blanc put into the milk 
hefore it boils (or it will harden instead of melt) and 
allowed to dissolve, stirring constantly, will make the 
sauce you wish, she will be able at all times to produce 
a white sauce that you need not be ashamed of. When 
the sauce is nearly ready to serve, stir in a good piece of 
butter — a large spoonful to half a pint ; when mixed, 
the sauce is ready. Brown sauce can always be made 
by taking a cup of broth or soup and dissolving in the 
same way a piece of the roux ; and also, if desired, a 
piece of Montpellier butter. If there is no soup of course 
you make it with a piece of glaze. 

Brown flour is also a convenient thing to have ready ; 
it is simply cooking flour in the oven until it is a pale 
brown ; if it is allowed to get dark it will be bitter, and, 
that it may brown evenly, it requires to be laid on a large 
flat baking pan and stirred often. Useful for thickening 
stews, hash, etc. 



CHAPTER V. 

LUN^CHEOK. 

Luncheon is usually, in this country;, either a forlorn 
meal of cold meat or hash, or else a sort of early dinner, 
both of which are a mistake. If it is veritably luncheon^ 
and not early dinner, it should be as unlike that later 
meal as possible for variety's sake, and, in any but very 
small families, there are so many dishes more suitable 
for luncheon than any other meal, that it is easy to 
have great variety with very little trouble. 

I wish it were more the fashion here to have many of 
the cold dishes which are popular on the other side the 
Atlantic ; and, in spite of the fact that table prejudices 
are very difficult to get over, I will append a few recipes 
in the hope that some lady, more progressive than prej- 
udiced, may give them a trial, convinced that their ex- 
cellence, appearance, and convenience will win them 
favor. 

By having most dishes cold at luncheon, it makes it a 
distinct meal from the hot breakfast and dinner. In 
summer, the cold food and a salad is especially refresh- 
ing ; in winter, a nice hot soup or puree — thick soup is 
preferable at luncheon to clear, which is well fitted to 
precede a heavy meal — ^and some savory entree are very 
desirable, while cold raised pie, galantine, jellied fish, and 
potted meats may ever, at that season, find their appro- 
priate place on the luncheon table. The potatoes, which 

S5 



36 Culture and Cooking. 

are the only vegetable introduced at strict lunch, should 
be prepared in some fancy manner, as croquettes, mashed 
and browned, a la mditre dliotel, or in snow. The latter 
mode is pretty and novel ; I will, therefore, include it 
in my recipes for luncheon dishes. Omelets, too, are 
excellent at luncheon. 

In these remarks I am thinking especially of large 
families, whose luncheon table might be provided Avith 
a dish of galantine, one of collared fish, and a meat pie, 
besides the steak, cutlets, or warmed-over meat, without 
anything going to waste. In winter most cold jellied 
articles will keep a fortnight, and in summer three or 
four days. 

WiNDSOK Pie.— Take slices of veal cutlet, half an 
inch thick, and very thin slices of lean boiled ham ; put 
at the bottom of one of these veal-pie dishes or " bak- 
ers," about two to three inches deep, a layer of the veal, 
seasoned, then one of ham, then one of force-meat, made 
as follows : Take a little veal, or if you have sausage- 
meat ready-made, it will do, as much fine dry bread- 
crumbs, a dessert- spoonful of finely chopped parsley, in 
which is a salt-spoonful of powdered thyme, savory, and 
marjoram, if you have them, with salt and pepper, and 
mix with enough butter to make it a crumbling paste; 
lay a thin layer of this on the ham, then another of veal, 
then ham and force-meat again, until the dish is quite 
full. Lay something flat upon it, and then a weight for 
an hour. You must have prepared, from bones and 
scraps of veal, about a pint of stiff veal jelly ; pour this 
over the meat, and then take strips of rich puff paste 
(the 'brioche paste would be excellent in hot weather), 
wet the edge of the dish, and lay the strips round, press- 
ing them lightly to the dish ; roll the cover a little 



Luncheon, 37 

larger than the top of the dish, and lay it on, first wet- 
ting the surface, not the edge, of the strips round the 
lips of the dish ; press the two together, then make a hole 
in the center and ornament as you please ; but I never 
ornament the edge of a pie, as it is apt to prevent the 
paste from rising. An appropriate and simple ornament 
for meat pies is to roll a piece of paste very thin, cut it 
in four diamond-shaped pieces, put one point of each to 
the hole in the center so that you have one on each end, 
and one each side, then roll another little piece of paste 
as thin as possible, flour it and double it, then double it 
again, bring all the corners together in your hand, like 
a little bundle, then with a sharp knife give a quick cut 
over the top of the ball of paste, cutting quite deeply, 
then another across ; if your cut has been clean and 
quick, you will now be able to turn half back the leaves 
of paste as if it were a half-blown rose. The ends which 
you have gathered together in your hand are to be in- 
serted in the hole in the center of the pie. Then brush 
over with yolk of Qgg beaten very well in a little milk or 
water, and bake an hour and a half. 

This way of covering and ornamenting a pie is ap- 
propriate for all meat pies ; pigeon pie should, however, 
have the little red feet skinned by dipping in boiling 
water, then rubbed in a cloth, when skin and nails peel 
off ; if allowed to lie in the water, the flesh comes too; 
then one pair is put at each end of the pie, a hole being 
cut to insert them, or four are put in the center instead 
of the rose. 

The Windsor pie is intended to be eaten cold, as are all 
veal and ham pies, the beauty of the jelly being lost in 
a hot pie. Do not fail to try it on that account, for 
cold pies are excellent things. 



38 Culture and Cooking. 

Another yeal an^d ham pie, more usual, and proba- 
bly the *'weal and hammer'' that ^^mellered the organ" 
of Silas Wegg, was manufactured by Mrs. Boffin from 
this recipe ; it is as follows : 

Take the thick part of breast of yeal, removing all the 
bones, which put on for grayy, stewing them long and 
slowly; put a layer of yeal, pepper and salt, then a thin 
sprinkling of ham; if boiled, cut in slices; if raw, cut a 
slice in dice, which scald before using, then more yeal 
and again ham. If force-meat balls are liked, make 
some force-meat as for Windsor pie, using if you prefer it 
chopped hard-boiled eggs in place of chopped meat, and 
binding into a paste with a raw ^gg ; then make into 
balls, which drop into the creyices of the pie ; boil two 
or three eggs quite hard, cut each in four and lay them 
round the sides and oyer the top, pour in about a gill of 
grayy, and coyer the same as the Windsor pie. In either 
of these pies the force-meat may be left out, a sweetbread 
cut up, or mushroons put in. 

A chicken pie to eat cold is yery fine made in this way. 

Kaised pork pies are so familiar to every one who has 
visited England, and, in spite of the greasy idea, are so 
very good, that I introduce a well-tried recipe, feeling 
sure any one who eats pork at all will find it worth while 
to give them a trial; they will follow it with many another. 

The paste for them is made as follows : 

Eub into two pounds of flour a liberal half pound of 
butter, then melt in half a pint of hot, but not boiling 
milk, another half pound — or it may be lard; pour this 
into the flour, and knead it into a smooth, firm paste. 
Properly raised pies should be molded by hand, and I will 
endeavor to describe the method in case any persever- 
ing lady would like to try and have the orthodox thing. 



Luncheon, 39 

But pie molds of tin, opening at the side, are to be 
bought, and save much trouble; the mold, if used, should 
be well buttered, and the pie taken out when done, and 
returned to the oven for the sides to brown. 

To " raise" a pie, proceed thus : While the paste is 
warm, form a ball of paste into a cone; then with the 
fist work inside it, till it forms an oval cup ; continue to 
knead till you have the walls of an even thickness, then 
pinch a fold all around the bottom. If properly done, 
you have an oval, flat-bottomed crust, with sides about 
two inches high ; fill this with pork, fat and lean 
together, well peppered and salted; then, work an oval 
cover, as near the size of the bottom cover as you can, 
and wet the edges of the wall, lay the cover on, and 
pinch to match the bottom; ornament as directed for 
Windsor pie, wash with ^^g, and bake a pale brown in a 
moderate oven ; they must be well cooked, or the meat 
will not be good. One containing a pound of meat may 
be cooked an hour and a quarter. All these pies are 
served in slices, cut through to the bottom. 

Galantines are very handsome dishes, not very diflBcult 
to make, and generally popular. I give a recipe for a 
very simple and delicious one : 

Take a fine breast of veal, remove all gristle, tendons, 
bones, and trim to fifteen inches in length and eight 
wide; use the trimmings and bones to help make the 
jelly, then put on the meat a layer of force-meat made 
thus : Take one pound of sausage meat, or lean veal, to 
which add half a pound of bread-crumbs, parsley and 
thyme to taste; grate a little nutmeg, pepper, salt, and 
the juice of half a lemon ; have also some long strips an 
inch thick of fat bacon or pork, and lean of veal, and 
lean ham, well seasoned with pepper, salt, and finely 



40 . Culture and Cooking. 

chopped shallots. Lay on the meat a layer of force- 
meat an inch thick, leaving an inch and a half on each 
side uncoTcred ; then lay on your strips of ham, yeal, 
and bacon fat, alternately; then another of force-meat, 
but only half an inch thick, as too much force-meat 
will spoil the appearance of the dish ; if you have any 
cold tongue, lay some strips in, also a few blanched 
pistachio nuts (to be obtained of a confectioner) will 
give the appearance of true French galantine. Eoll up 
the veal, and sew it with a packing or coarse needle and 
fine twine, tie it firmly up in a piece of linen. Observe 
that you do not put your pistachio nuts amid the force- 
meat, where, being green, their appearance would be lost; 
put them in crevices of the meats. 

Cook this in sufficient water to cover, in which you 
must have the trimminsrs of the breast and a knuckle of 
veal, or hock of pork, two onions, a carrot, half a head 
of celery, two cloves, a blade of mace, and a good bunch 
of parsley, thyme and bay leaf, two ounces of salt. Set 
the pot on the fire till it is at boiling point, then draw 
it to the back and let it simmer three hours, skimming 
carefully ; then take it from the fire, leaving it in the 
stock till nearly cold; then take it out, remove the string 
from the napkin, and roll the galantine up tighter — if 
too tight at first it will be hard — tying the napkin at 
each end only; then place it on a dish, set another dish 
on it, on which place a fourteen-pound weight; this will 
cause it to cut firm. When quite cold, remove strings 
and cloth, and it is ready to be ornamented with jelly. 
When the stock in which the galantine was cooked is cold 
take off the fat and clarify it, first trying, however, if it 
is in right condition, by putting a little on ice. If it is 
not stiff enough to cut firm, you must reduce it by boil- 



Luncheon, 41 

ing ; if too stiff, that is approaching glaze, add a little 
water, then clarify by adding whites. of eggs, as directed 
to clarify soup (see soups). A glass of sherry and two 
spoonfuls of tarragon or common yinegar are a great 
improvement. Some people like this jelly cut in dice, 
to ornament the galantine, part of it may then also serve 
to ornament other dishes at the table. But I prefer to 
have the galantine enveloped in jelly, which may be done 
by putting it in an oblong soup tureen or other vessel 
that will contain it, leaving an inch space all round, 
then pouring the jelly over it. 

Jellied fish is a favorite dish with many, and is very 
simple to prepare; it is also very ornamental. Take 
flounders or almost any flat fish that is cheapest at the 
time you require them. Clean and scrape them, cut 
them in small pieces, but do not cut off the fins ; put 
them in a stew-pan with a few small button onions or 
one large one, a half teaspoonful of sugar, a glass of 
sherry, a dessert-spoonful of lemon juice, and a small 
bunch of parsley. To one large flounder put a quart of 
water, and if you are going to jelly oysters put in their 
liquor and a little salt. Stew long and slowly, skim- 
ming well ; then strain, and if not perfectly clear clarify 
as elsewhere directed. (See if your stock jellies, by try- 
ing it on ice before you clarify.) Now take a mold, put 
in it pieces of cold salmon, eels that have been cooked, 
or oysters, the latter only just cooked enough in the 
stock to plump them ; pour a little of the jelly in the 
mold, then three or four half slices of lemon, then oys- 
ters or the cold fish, until the mold is near full, dis- 
posing the lemon so that it will be near the sides and 
decorate the jelly ; then pour the rest of the jelly over 
all and stand in boiling water for a few minutes, then 



42 Culture and Cooking, 

put it in a cold place, on ice is best, for some hours. 
When about to serve, dip the mold in hot water, turn 
out on a dish, garnish with lettuce leaves or parsley and 
hard-boiled eggs. The latter may be introduced into 
the jelly cut in quarters if it is desired ; very ornamen- 
tal force-meat balls made bright green with spinach juice 
are also an improvement in appearance. 

A Nevt Matokj^aise (Soyer's).— Put a quarter of a 
pint of stiff veal jelly (that has been nicely flavored with 
vegetables) on ice in a bowl, whisking it till it is a white 
froth ; then add half a pint of salad oil and six spoon- 
fuls of tarragon vinegar, hy degrees, first oil, then vine- 
gar, continually whisking till it forms a white, smooth, 
sauce-like cream ; season with half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a quarter ditto of white pepper, and a very little sugar, 
whisk it a little more and it is ready. It should be 
dressed pyramidically over the article it is served with. 
The advantage of this sauce is that (although more deli- 
cate than any other) you may dress it to any height 
you like, and it will remain so any length of time ; if 
the temperature is cool, it will remain hours without 
appearing greasy or melting. It is absolutely necessary, 
however, that it should be prepared on ice. 

All these dishes, however, are only adapted for large 
families, but there are several ways of improving on the 
ordinary lunch table of very small ones. And nothing 
is more pleasant for the mistress of one of these very 
small families than to have a friend drop in to lunch, 
and have a recherche lunch to offer with little trouble. 
Warming over will aid her in this, and to that chapter 
I refer her ; but there are one or two ways of having 
cold relishes always ready, which help out an impromptu 
meal wonderfully. 



Luncheon, 43 

Potted meats are a great resource to English house- 
keepers ; this side the Atlantic they are chiefly known 
through the medium of Cross & Blackwell, though lat- 
terly one or two American firms have introduced somo 
very admirable articles of the sort. Home-made potted 
meats are, however, better and less expensive than those 
bought ; they should be packed away in jars, Liebig's 
extract of meat jars not being too small for the purpose, 
as, while covered with the fat they keep well ; once 
opened, they require eating within a week or ten days, 
except in very cold weather. 

Potted bloater is one of the least expensive and appe- 
tizing of all potted meats. To make it, take two or three 
or more bloaters, cut off the heads and cleanse them, put 
them in the oven long enough to cook them through; 
take them out, take off the skin, and remove the meat 
from the bones carefully ; put the meat of the fish in a 
jar with half its weight of butter, leave it to slowly cook 
in a cool oven for an hour, then take it out, put the fish 
into a mortar or strong dish, pour the butter on it care- 
fully, but don't let the gravy pass too, unless the fish is 
to be eaten very quickly, as it would prevent it keeping. 
Beat both butter and fish till they form a paste, add a 
little cayenne, and press it into small pots, pouring on 
each melted butter, or mutton suet. Either should be. 
the third of an inch thick on the bloater. This makes 
excellent sandwiches. 

Potted Ham. — Take any remains of ham you have, 
even fried, if of a nice quality, is good for the purpose '^ 
take away all stringy parts, sinew, or gristle, put it in a 
slow oven with its weight of butter, let it stay macerat- 
ing in the butter till very tender, then beat it in a mor- 
tar, add cayenne, and pack in pots in the same way as 



44 Culture and Cooking, 

the bloater. Thus you may pot odds and ends of any 
meat or fish you have, and as a little potted meat goes a 
long way, when you have a little lobster, a bit of chicken 
breast, or even cold veal, I advise you to use it in this 
way ; you will then have a little stock of dainties in the 
house to fall back on at any time for unexpected calls — 
a very important thing in the country. 

Potted chicken or veal requires either a little tongue 
or lean ham to give flavor ; but failing these, a little 
ravigotte butter, beaten in after the meat is well 
pounded, is by no means a bad substitute. 

Many people like the flavor of anchovies, but do not 
like the idea of eating raw fish ; for these anchovy but- 
ter is very acceptable. 

Take the anchovies out of the liquor in which they are 
packed, but do not wash them, put them in twice their 
weight of butter in a jar, which stand in boiling water ; 
set all back of the stove for an hour, then pound, add 
cayenne, and pack in glasses. 

Unexpected company to luncheon with a lady who has 
to eat that meal alone generally, and (as is the unwise 
way of such ladies) makes it a very slender meal, is one 
of the ordeals of a young housekeeper ; company to lunch 
and nothing in the house. But there is generally a 
dainty luncheon in every house if you know how to pre- 
pare it ; there certainly always will be if you keep your 
store-room supplied with the things I have named. Let 
the table be prettily laid at all times, then if you have 
potted meat and preserves, have them put on the table. 
Are there cold potatoes? If so cut them up into potato 
salad, if they are whole ; if broken, warm them in a 
wine-glass of milk, a teaspoonful of flour, and a piece 
as large as an ^gg of maitre d'hotel butter. Have you 



Luncheon, 45 

such scraps of cold meat as could not come to table? Toss 
them up with a half cup of water, a slice of glg-ze (oh, 
blessed ever-ready glaze !) a teaspoonf ul of ravigotte, or 
maitre dliotel, and a teaspoonf ul of roux or blanc, ac- 
cording as your meat is light or dark, season, and serve. 
Or you have no meat, then you have eggs, and what bet- 
ter than an omelet and such an omelet as the following? 
Take the crumb of a slice of bread, soak it in hot milk 
(cold will do, but hot is better), beat up whites of four 
eggs to a high froth; mix the bread with all the milk it 
will absorb, no more, into a paste, add the yolks of eggs 
with a little salt, set the pan on the fire with an ounce of 
butter. Let it get very hot, then mix the whites of eggs 
with the yolks and bread lightly, pour in the pan, and 
move about for a miuute ; if the oven is hot, when the 
omelet is brown underneath, set the pan in the oven 
for five minutes, or until the top is set ; then double 
half over, and serve. If your guests have a liking for 
sweets, and your potted meats supply the savory part of 
your luncheon, then have a brown gravy ready to serve 
with it. Put into a half cup of boiling water a slice of 
glaze, a spoonful of roux, and enough Harvey sauce, or 
mushroom powder, to flavor. If your omelet is to be 
«weet, before you fold it put in a layer of preserves. 

The advantage of the omelet I have here given ig 
that it keeps plump and tender till cold, so that five 
minutes of waiting does not turn it into leather, the 
great objection with omelets generally. \ 

Potatoes for luncheon, as I have said, should always 
be prepared in some fancy way, and snow is a very pretty 
one. Have some fine mealy potatoes boiled, carefully 
poured off, and set back of the stove with a cloth over 
them till they are quite dry and fall apart ; then have a

46 ' Culture and Cooking. 

colander, or coarse wire sieve made liot and a Tiot dish in 
which .to serve them, pass the floury potatoes through 
the sieve, taking care not to crush the snow as it falls. 
You require a large dish heaping full, and be careful 
it is kept hot. 

This mode of preparing potatoes, although very pretty 
and novel, must never be attempted with any but the 
whitest and mealiest kind. 

The remains of cold potatoes may be prepared thus: 
Put three ounces of butter in a frying-pan in which fry 
three onions sliced till tender, but not very brown, then 
put on the potatoes cut in slices, and shake them till 
they are of a nice brown color, put a spoonful of chopped 
parsley, salt, pepper, and juice of a lemon, shake well 
that all may mix together, dish, and serve very hot. 



CHAPTER VI. 

A CHAPTER 0:S GENERAL MANAGEMENT IN VERY 
SMALL FAMILIES. 

A VERY small family, *'a young menage,^' for in- 
etance, is very much more difficult to cater for without 
waste than a larger one; two people are so apt to get tired 
of anything, be it ever so good eating, when it has been 
on the table once or twice; therefore it would be useless 
to make galantine or the large pies I have indicated, ex- 
cept for occasions when guests are expected ; but, as I 
hope to aid young housekeepers to have nice dishes when 
alone, I will devote this chapter to their needs. 

The chapter on " Warming Over " will be very useful 
also to this large class. 

In the first place it is well to have regard, when part 
of a dish leaves the table, as to whether it, or any partic- 
ular part of it, will make a nice little cold dish, or a re- 
chaiiffe; in that case have it saved, unless it is required 
for the servants' dinner (it is well to manage so that it is 
not needed for that purpose); for instance, if there is the 
wing and a slice or two of the breast of a chicken left, it 
will make a dainty little breakfast dish, or cold, in jelly, 
be nice for lunch. There is always jelly if you have 
roast chicken, if you manage properly, and this is how 
you do \\f : 

Carefully save the feet, throat, gizzard, and liver of 
your chickens; scald the feet by pouring boiling water 

47 



48 Culture and Cooking, 

over them; leave them just a minute, and pull off the 
outer skin and nails; they come away very readily, leav- 
ing the feet delicately white; put these with the other 
giblets, properly cleansed, into a small saucepan with an 
onion, a slice of carrot, a sprig of parsley, and a pint of 
water (if you have the giblets of one chicken), if of 
two, put a quart; let this slowly simmer for two hours 
and a half; it will be reduced to about half, and form a 
stiff jelly when cold; a glass of sherry, and squeeze of 
lemon, or teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar, makes this 
into a delicious aspic, and should.be added if to be eaten 
cold. The jelly must of course be strained. 

In roasting chickens, if you follow the rule for meat, 
that is, put no water in the pan, but a piece of butter, and 
dredge a very little flour over the chicken, you will have 
a nice brown glaze at the bottom of the pan, provided 
it has been cooked in a quich oven; if in a cool oven 
there will be nothing brown at all ; but we will suppose 
the bird is browned to a turn ; pour your gravy from the 
giblets into the pan, take off every bit of the glaze or 
osmazone that adheres, and let it dissolve, rubbing it 
with the back of the spoon ; then, if you are likely to 
have any chicken left cold, pour off a little gravy in a 
cup through a fine strainer, leaving in your pan suffi- 
cient for the dinner ; in this mash up the liver till it is 
a smooth paste which thickens the gravy, and serve. 
Some object to liver, therefore the use of it is a matter 
of taste. If you dress the chickens English fashion, you 
will need the liver and gizzard to tuck under the wings ; 
in this case, stew only the feet and throat, using a little 
meat of any kind, if you have it, to take their place ; 
but on no account fail to use the feet, as they are as rich 
in jelly as calves' feet in proportion to their size. 



General Management in Small Families, 49 

The jelly laid aside will be enough to ornament and 
give relish to a little dish of cold chicken, and changes 
it from a dry and commonplace thing to a recherche one. 
If two chickens are cooked it is more economical than 
one ; there is, then, double the amount of gravy, gener- 
ally sufficient, if you lay some very nice pieces of cold 
chicken in a bowl, to pour over it and leave it enveloped 
in jelly ; you still then, if from dinner for two people, 
have perhaps joints enough to make a dish of curry or 
fricassee, or any of the many ways in which cold chicken 
may be used, for which see chapter on '' Warming Over." 

For small households large joints are to be avoided, 
but even a small roast is a large joint when there are but 
two or three to eat it. For this reason it is a good plan 
to buy such joints as divide well. A sirloin of beef is 
better made into two fine dishes than into one roast, 
and then warmed over twice. Every one knows that 
'^ Filet de hceuf Chateaubriand" is one of the classical 
dishes of the French table, that to a Frenchman luxury 
can go no further ; but every one does not know how 
entirely within his power it is to have that dish as often 
as he has roast beef ; how convenient it would be to so 
have it. Here it is : When your sirloin roast comes from 
the butcher, take out the tenderloin or fillets, which you 
must always choose thick ; cut it across into steaks an 
inch thick, trim them, cover them with a coat of butter 
(or oil, which is much better), and broil them ten min- 
utes, turning them often ; garnish with fried potatoes, 
and serve with sauce Chateaubriand, as follows : Put a 
gill of white wine (or claret will do if you have no 
white) into a saucepan, with a piece of glaze, weighing 
an ounce and a half ; add three quarters of a pint of 
espagnoJe, and simmer fifteen minutes ; when ready to 
3 



50 Culture and Cooking, 

serve, thicken with two ounces of mattre dliotel butter 
in w^hich a dessert-spoonful of flour has been worked. 
That is how Jules Gouffe's recipe runs ; but, as no small 
family will keep espagnole ready made, allow a little more 
glaze (of course the recipe as given may be divided to 
half or quarter, provided the correct proportions are 
retained), and use a tablespoonful of roux and the mattre 
dliotel butter, both of which you have probably in your 
store-room ; if not, brown a little flour, chop some pars- 
ley, and add to two ounces of butter ; work them to- 
gether, then let them dissolve in the sauce, for which 
purpose let it go off the boil ; let the sauce simmer a 
minute, skim, and serve. 

The sirloin of beef, denuded of its fillet, is still a good 
roast ; and as you can't have your cake and eat it too, 
and hot fresh roast beef is better than the same warmed 
over, warm ye never so wisely, I think this plan may 
commend itself to those who like nice little dinners. 

A nice little dinner of a soup, an entree, or made dish, 
salad, and dessert, really costs no more than frequent 
roast meat, or even steak and pudding, by following 
some such plan as this : 

Sunday. — Pot-au-feu and roast lamb, leg of mutton 
or other good joint, etc. 

Monday. — Eice or vermicelli soup made with remains 
of the bouillon from pot-au-feu. If the Sunday joint 
was a fore or hindquarter of lamb it should have been 
divided, say the leg from the loin, thus providing choice 
roasts for two days, and yet having enough cold lamb — 
that favorite dish with so many — for luncheon with a sal- 
ad ; and, surprising to say, after hot roast lamb for dinner 
Sunday, cold lunch for Monday, another roast Monday, 
and cold or warmed up for lunch Tuesday, there will 



General Management in Small Families, 51 

still be (supposing as I do, in preparing this chapter, 
that the family consists only of gentleman, lady, and ser- 
vant) remains enough from the two cold joints to make 
cromesquis of lamb (see recipe), a little dish of mince, or 
a delicate saute of lamb for breakfast. It is surprising 
■what may be done with odds and ends in a small fam- 
ily ; a tiny plate of pieces, far too small to make an ap- 
pearance on the table, and which, if special directions 
are not given, will seem to Bridget not worth saving, 
will, with each piece dipped into the batter a la Car erne, 
and fried in hot fat, make a tempting dish for breakfast, 
or an entree for dinner or luncheon. Two tablespoonfuls 
only of chopped meat of any kind will make croquettes 
for two or three people ; hence, ' save the pieces.' But 
to return to our bills of fare : I have given the two roasts 
of lamb for consecutive days, because the weather in 
lamb season is usually too warm to keep it ; when this 
can be done, however, it is pleasanter to leav.e the second 
joint of lamb till Tuesday. Should a forequarter (abroad 
held in greater esteem than the hindquarter) have been 
chosen, get the butcher to take out the shoulder in one 
round thick joint, English fashion ; this crisply roasted 
is far more delicious than the leg ; you then have the 
chops to be breaded, and an excellent dish of the neck 
and breast, either broiled, curried, stewed with peas, or 
roast. 

Yet how often we see a whole quarter of lamb put in 
the oven for two or three people who get tired of the 
sight of it cold, yet feel in economy bound to eat it. 

Should sirloin of beef have been the Sunday dinner, 
you will know what to do with it, from directions al- 
ready given; and as a sirloin of beef, even with the fillet 
out, win be more than required for one dinner, it may 



52 Culture and Cooking, 

serve for a third day, dressed in one of the various ways 
I shall give in chapter on ^^AYarmi-ng Over." You have 
still at your disposal the bouilli or beef from which you 
have made your pot-au-feii, which, if it has been care- 
fully boiled, not galloped, nor allowed to fall to rags, is 
very good eating. Cut thin with lettuce, or in winter 
celery, in about equal quantities, and a good salad dress- 
ing, it is excellent; or, made into hash, f ritadella, or even 
rissoles, is savory and delicious ; only bear in mind with 
this, as all cooked meats, the gravy drawn out must be 
replaced by stock or glaze ; it is very easy to warm over 
bouilli satisfactorily, as a cup of the soup made from it 
can always be kept for gravy. 

A leg of mutton makes two excellent joints, and is 
seldom liked cold — as beef and lamb often are. 

Select a large fine leg, have it cut across, that each 
part may weigh about equally; roast the thick or fillet end 
and serve with or without onion sauce {a la souMse) ; 
boil the knuckle in a small quantity of water, just 
enough to cover it, with a carrot, turnip, onion, and 
bunch of parsley, and salt in the water, serve with caper 
sauce and mashed turnips. The broth from this is ex- 
cellent soup served thus : Skim it carefully, take out 
the vegetables, and chop a small quantity of parsley very 
fine, then beat up in a bowl two eggs, pour into them a 
little of the broth — not boiling — beating all the time, 
then draw your soup back till it is off the boil, and pour 
in the eggs, stirring continually till it is on the boiling 
point again (but it must not boil, or the eggs will cur- 
dle and spoil the soup), and then turn it into a hot tureen 
and serve. Use remains of the cold roast and boiled mut- 
ton together, to make made dishes; between the days of 
having the roast and boiled mutton you may have had a 



General Management in Small Families, 53 

fowl, and the remains from that will make you a second 
dish to go with your joint. 

The remains from the first cooked mutton, in form 
of curry, mince, salmi, or sauU, will be a second dish 
with your fowl. 

Veal is one of the most convenient things to have for 
a small family, as it warms over in a variety of ways, and 
in some is actually better than when put on the table as 
a joint. By having a little fish one day, instead of soup, 
and a little game another, and remembering when you 
have an especially dainty thing, to have one with it a 
little more substantial and less costly, you may have vari- 
ety at little expense. 

For instance, if you find it convenient to have for din- 
ner fritadelle (see '' Warming Over''') or miroton of beef, 
or cold mutton curried, you might have broiled birds, or 
roast pigeon, or game. In this consists good manage- 
ment, to live so that the expenses of one day balance 
those of the other — unless you are so happily situated 
that expense is a small matter, in which case these re- 
marks will not apply to you at all. Then, never mind 
warming over, or making one joint into two; let your 
poor neighbors and Bridget's friends enjoy your superflu- 
ity. To the woman with a moderate income it usually 
is a matter of importance, or ought to be, that her 
weekly expenditure should not exceed a certain amount, 
and for this she must arrange that any extra expense is 
balanced by a subsequent economy. 

Salads add much to the health and elegance of a din- 
ner ; it is in early spring an expensive item if lettuce is 
used; but no salad can be more delicious or more health- 
ful than dressed celery; and by buying when cheap, ar- 
ranging with a man to lay in your cellar, covered with 



54 Culture and Cooking, 

soil, enough for the winter's use, it need cost but moder- 
ately. Celeraic, or turnip-rooted celery is another salad 
that is yery popular with our German friends; it is a 
bulbous celery, the root being the part eaten ; these are 
cooked like potatoes, cut in slices, and dressed with oil 
and vinegar, or mayonnaise, it is exceedingly good. 
Potato salad is always procurable, and in summer at 
lunch, instead of the hot vegetable, or in winter when 
green salad is dear, is very valuable. It may be varied 
by the addition, one day, of a few chopped pickles, an- 
other, a little onion, or celery, or parsley, or tarragon, a 
little ravigotte butter beaten to cream with the vinegar, 
or with meat, as follows : Boil the potatoes in their skins, 
peel them, cut them into pieces twice the thickness 
of a fifty-cent piece, and put them into a salad bowl with 
cold meat (bouilli from soup is excellent) ; put to them 
a teaspoonful of salt, half that quantity of pepper, two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, three or even four of oil, and 
a teaspoonful of chopped parsley. You can vary this by 
putting at different times some chopped celery or pickles, 
olives, or anchovies. 



CHAPTER VII. 

OHi FEYIN^G AND BKOILIKG. 

Pryixg is one of the operations in cookery in which 
there are more failures than any other, or, at least, there 
appear to be more, because the failure is always so yery 
apparent. Nothing can make a dish of breaded cutlets 
on which are bald white spots look inviting, or livid- 
looking fish, just flaked here and there with the bread 
that has been persuaded to stay on. And, provided you 
have enough fat in the pan— there should always be 
enough to immerse the article ; therefore use a deep iron 
or enameled pan — there can be but two reasons why you 
fail. Your fat has not been hot enough, or your crumbs 
have not been fine and even. 

Many suppose when the fat bubbles and boils in the 
pan that it is quite hot ; it is far from being so. Others 
again are so much nearer the truth that they know it 
must become silent, that is, boil and cease to boil, before 
it is ready, but even that is not enough; it must be silent 
some time, smoke, and appear to be on the point of burn- 
ing, then drop a bit of bread in; if it crisps and takes 
color directly, quickly put in your articles. 

These articles, whether cutlets or fish, must have been 
carefully prepared, or herein may lie the second cause of 
failure. Any cookery book will give you directions how 
to crumb, follow them ; but what some do not tell you 
is, that your bread-crumbs should be finely sifted; every 

55 



$6 Culture and Cooking. 

coarse crumb is liable to drop off and bring with it a 
good deal of the surrounding surface. 

I also follow the French plan in using the Q,gg, and 
mix with it oil and water in the proportion of three 
eggs, one tablespoonful of oil, one of water, and a little 
salt, beat together and use. It is a good plan to keep a 
supply of panure or dried bread-crumbs always ready. 
Cut any slices of baker's bread, dry them in a cool oven 
so that they remain quite colorless, or they will not do 
for the purpose. When as dry as crackers, crush under 
a rolling-pin, and sift ; keep in a jar for use. 

In no branch of cooking is excellence more appreci- 
ated than in that of frying. A dish of filets de sole or 
cutlets, crisp and golden brown, is an ornament to any 
table, and is seldom disdained by any one. Apropos of 
filets de sole; it is very high-sounding yet very attainable, 
as I shall show. I was staying with a friend early in 
spring, a lady always anxious for table novelties. " Oh, 
do tell me what fish to order, I should like something 
fried, now that you are here to tell cook how to do it ; 
she hasn't the wildest idea, although she would be 
astounded to hear me say so." "Have you ever 
had flounders ?" I asked. " Flounders !" My friend's 
pretty nose went up the eighth of an inch, and her con- 
fidence in my p(^ers as counselor went down to zero. 
*' Flounders ! but they are a very common fish you 
know." "I know they are very delicious," I answered. 
" Order them, and trust me ; but I must coax the 
autocrat of your kitchen to allow me to cook and pre- 
pare them myself." 

An hour before dinner I went into the kitchen, put 
at least a pound of lard into a deep frying-pan, and 
set it where it would get gradually hot, then I turned 



On Frying and Broiling. 57 

my attention to the fish ; they were thick, firm floun- 
ders, and were ready cleaned, scraped, and the heads 
off. I then proceeded to hone one in the following 
way : Take a sharp knife and split the flounder right 
down the middle of the back, then run the knife care- 
fully between the flesh and bones going toward the edge. 
You haye now detached one quarter of the flesh from 
the bone, do the other half in the same way, and when 
the back is thus entirely loose from the bone, turn the 
fish over and do the same with the other part. You will 
now find you can remove the bone whole from the fish, 
detaching, as you do so, any flesh still retaining the 
bone, then you have two halves of the fish ; cut away 
the fins, and you have four quarters of solid fish. Now 
see if the fat is very hot, set it forward while you wipe 
your fish dry, and dip each piece in milk, then in flour. 
Try if the fat is hot by dropping a crumb into it ; if it 
browns at once, put in the fish. When they are beauti- 
fully brown, which will be in about ten minutes, take 
them up in the colander, and then lay them on a towel 
to absorb any fat, lay them on a hot dish, and garnish 
with slices of lemon and parsley or celery tops. 

Now when this dish made its appearance, my friend's 
husband, a Ion vivant, greeted it with, *'Aha! Filets 
de sole d, la Delmonico,^^ and as nothing to the con- 
trary was said until dinner was over, he ate them under 
the impression that they were \eT\idh\Q filets de sole. 
Of course I can't pretend to say whether M. Delmonico 
imports his soles, or uses the homely flounder ; but I do 
know that one of his frequenters knew no difference. 

Oysters should be laid on a cloth to drain thoroughly, 
then rolled in fine sifted cracker dust, and dropped into 
very hot fat; do not put more oysters in the pan than 
3* 



58 Culture and Cooking, 

will fry without one overlapping the other. Very few 
minutes will brown them beautifully, if your fat was hot 
enough, and as a minute too long toughens and shrinks 
them, be very careful that it browns a cube of bread al- 
most directly, before you begin the oysters. Egg and 
bread-crumb may be used instead of cracker dust, but it 
is not the proper thing, and is a great deal more trouble. 
Should you be desirous of using it, however, the oysters 
must be carefully wiped dry before dipping them; while 
for cracker dust they are not wiped, but only drained 
well. 

Fish of any kind, fried in batter a la Careme (see 
recipe), is very easy to do, and very nice. 

Carefully save veal, lamb, beef, and pork drippings. 
Keep a crock to put it in, and, clarified as I shall direct, 
it is much better than lard for many purposes, aud for 
frying especially ; it does not leave the dark look that is 
sometimes seen on articles fried in lard. The perfection 
of "friture," or frying-fat, according to Gouffe, is equal 
parts of lard and beef fat melted together. 

Yet there are families where dripping is never used — 
is looked upon as unfit to use — while the truth is that 
many persons quite unable to eat articles fried in lard 
would find no inconvenience from those fried in beef fat. 
It is as wholesome as butter, and far better for the 
purpose. Butter, indeed, is only good for frying such 
things as omelets or scrambled eggs ; things that are 
cooked in a very short time, and require no great degree 
of heat. 

The same may be said of oil, than which, for fish, 
nothing can be better. Yet it can only be used once, 
and is unsuitable for things requiring long-sustained 
heat, as it soon gets bitter and rank. 



On Frying ajid Broiling. 59 

Do not be airaid to put a pound or two of fat in your 
pan for frying ; it is quite as economical as to put less 
for it can be used over and over again, a pail or crock 
being kept for the purpose of receiving it. Always in 
returning it to the crock pour it through a fine strainer, 
so that no sediment or brown particles may pass which 
would spoil the next frying. 

To clarify dripping, when poured from the meat-pan, 
it should go into a bowl, instead of the crock in which 
you wish to keep it. Then pour into the bowl also some 
boiling water, and add a little salt, stir it, and set it 
away. Next day, or when cold, run a knife round the 
bowl, and (unless it is pork) it will turn out in a solid 
cake, leaving the water and impurities at the bottom. 
Now scrape the bottom of your dripping, and put it in 
more boiling water till it melts, then stir again, another 
pinch of salt add, and let it cool again. When you take 
off the cake of fat, scrape it as before, and it is ready to 
be melted into the general crock, and will now keep for 
months in cool weather. If you are having frequent 
joints it is as well to do all your dripping together, once 
a week ; but do not leave it long at any season with wa- 
ter under it, as that would taint it. Fat skimmed from 
boiled meat, pot-au-feu, before the vegetables, etc., go 
in, is quite as good as that from roast, treated in the 
same way. 

Frying in batter is very easy and excellent for some 
things, such as warming over meat, being far better 
than eggs and crumbs. Careme gives the following 
recipe, which is excellent : 

Three quarters of a pound of sifted flour, mixed with 
two ounces of butter melted in warm water ; blow the 
butter off the water into the flour first, then enough of 



6o Culture and Cooking, 

the water to make a soft paste, which beat smooth, then 
more warm water till it is batter thick enough to mask 
the back of a spoon dipped into it, and salt to taste ; add 
the last tiling the whites of two eggs well beaten. 

Another batter, called a la Provengale, is also exceed- 
ingly good, especially for articles a little dry in them- 
selves, such as chickens to be warmed over, slices of cold 
veal, etc. 

Take same quantity of flour, two yolks of eggs, four 
tablespoonfuls of oil, mix with cold water, and add 
whites of eggs and salt as before. Into this batter I 
sometimes put a little chopped parsley, and the least bit 
of powdered thyme, or grated lemon -peel, or nutmeg ; 
this is, however, only a matter of taste. 

Broilikg is the simplest of all forms of cooking, and 
is essentially English. To broil well is very easy with 
a little attention. A brisk clear fire, not too high in 
the stove, is necessary to do it with ease ; yet if, as 
must sometimes happen, to meet the necessities of other 
cooking, your fire is very large, carefully fix the gridiron 
on two bricks or in any convenient manner, to prevent 
the meat scorching, then have the gridiron very hot be- 
fore putting your meat upon it ; turn it, if chop or 
steak, as soon as the gravy begins to start on the upper 
side ; if allowed to remain without turning long, the 
gravy forms a pool on the top, which, when turned, falls 
into the fire and is lost ; the action of the heat, if turned 
quickly, seals the pores and the gravy remains in the 
meat. If the fire is not very clear, put a cover over the 
meat on the gridiron, it will prevent its blackening or 
burning — if the article is thick I always do so— and it is 
an especially good plan with birds or chickens, which 
are apt to be raw at the joints unless this is done ; in- 



On Frying and Broiling. 6i 

deed, with the latter, I think it a good way to put them 
in a hot oven ten minutes before they go on to broil, 
then have a spoonful of mditre d/hotel butter to lay on 
the breast of each. Young spring chickens are some- 
times very dry, in which case dip them in melted but- 
ter, or, better still, oil them all over a little while be- 
fore cooking. There is nothing more unsightly than a 
sprawling dish of broiled chickens ; therefore, in prepar- 
ing them place them in good form, then, with a gentle 
blow of the rolling-pin, break the bones that they may 
remain so. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

KOASTIl^G. 

Ik spite of Brillat-Savarin's maxim that one may be- 
come a cook, but must be born a rotisseur, I am inclined 
to think one may also, by remembering one or two 
things, become a very good "roaster" (to translate the 
untranslatable), especially in our day, when the oven has 
taken the place of the spit, although a great deal of 
meat is spoiled in roasting ; a loin of lamb or piece of 
beef, that comes to the table so pale that you can't tell 
whether it has been boiled or merely wilted in the oven, 
is an aggravation so familiar, that a rich brown, well- 
roasted joint is generally a surprise. Perhaps the cook 
will tell you she has had the "hottest kind of an oven;" 
but then she has probably also had a well of water 
underneath it, the vapor from which, arising all the 
time, has effectually soddened the meat, and checked 
the browning. The surface of roast meat should be 
covered with a rich glaze, scientifically called "osma- 
zone." That the meat may be thus glazed, it should 
always go into a hot oven, so that, as the gravy exudes, 
it may congeal on the outside, thus sealing up the pores. 
The general plan, however, is to put meat into a warm 
oven an hour or two earlier than it should go, with a 
quantity of water and flour underneath it. The result in 
hot weather I have known to be very disagreeable, the 
tepid oven having, in fact, given a stale taste to the joint 

63 



Roasting, 63 

before it began to cook, and it at all times results in 
flavorless, tough meat. There is no time saved, either, 
in putting the meat in while the oven is yet cool. Heat 
up the oven till it is quite brisk, then put the meat in a 
pan, in which, if it is fat, you require no water ; if very 
lean, you may put half a teacup, just enough to prevent 
the pan burning ; you may rub a little flour over the 
joint or not, as you please, but never more than the sur- 
face moisture absorbs ; have no clinging particles of 
flour upon the joint, neither put salt nor pepper upon 
the meat before it goes into the oven ; salt draws out the 
gravy, which it is your object to keep in, and the flavor 
of pepper is entirely changed by the parching it undergoes 
when on the surface of the meat, the odor of scorched 
pepper, while cooking, being very offensive to refined 
nostrils. This does not occur when pepper is not on 
the surface ; for the inside of birds, in stuffing, and in 
meat pies it is indispensable, and the flavor undergoes 
no change. This remark on pepper applies also to 
broiling and frying. Always pepper after the article is 
cooked, and both for appearance and delicacy of flavor 
white pepper should always be used in preference to 
black. 

Meat, while in the oven, should be carefully turned 
about so that it may brown equally, and when it has 
been in half the time you intend to give it, or when the 
upper surface is well browned, turn it over. When it 
comes out of the oven put it on a hot dish, then care- 
fully pour off the fat by holding the corner of the meat 
pan over your dripping-pan, and very gently allowing

thick brown sediment beginning to run too, check it ; if 
there is still much fat on the surface, take it off with a

spoon ; then pour into the pan a little boiling water and 
salt, in quantity according to the quantity of sediment 
or glaze in the pan, and with a spoon rub off every speck 
of the dried gravy on the bottom and sides of the pan. 
Add no flour, the gravy must be thick enough with its 
own richness. If you have added too much water, so 
that it looks poor, you may always boil it down by set- 
ting the pan on the stove for a few minutes ; but it is 
better to put very little water at first, and add as the 
richness of the gravy allows. Now you have a rich 
brown gravy, instead of the thick whitey-brown broth 
so often served with roast meat. Every drop of this 
gravy and that from the dish should be carefully saved 
if left over. 

Save all dripping, except from mutton or meat with 
which onions are cooked, for purposes which I shall 
indicate in another place. 

Veal and pork require to be very thoroughly cooked. 
For them, therefore, the oven must not be too hot, nei- 
ther must it be lukewarm, a good even heat is best ; if 
likely to get too brown before it is thoroughly cooked, 
open the oven door. 



CHAPTEE IX. 

BOILIKG. 

BoiLiiJrG is one of the things about which cooks are 
most careless ; theoretically they almost always know 
meat should be slowly boiled, but their idea of "slow " is 
ruled by the fire ; they never attempt to rule that. There 
is a good rule given by Gouffe as to what slow boiling 
actually is : the surface of the pot should only show 
signs of ebullition at one side, just an occasional bubble. 
Simmering is a still slower process, and in this the pot 
should have only a sizzling round one part of the edge. 
All fresh meat should boil slowly ; ham or com beef 
should barely simmer. Yet they must not go off the 
boil at all, which would spoil fresh meat entirely ; steep- 
ing in water gives a flat, insipid taste. 

All vegetables except potatoes, asparagus, peas, and 
cauliflower should boil as fast as possible ; these four 
only moderately. Most vegetables are boiled far too long. 
Cabbage is as delicate as cauliflower in the summer and 
fall if boiled in plenty of water, to which a salt spoon- 
ful of soda has been added, as fast as possible for twenty 
minutes or half an hour, then drained and dressed. In 
winter it should be cut in six or eight pieces, hoiled fast , 
in plenty of water, for half an hour, no longer. Always 
give it plenty of room, let the water boil rapidly when 
you put it in . the pot, which set on the hottest part of 

65 



d^ Culture and Cooking. 

the fire to come to that point again, and you will have no 
more strong, rank, yellow stuff on your table, no bad odor 
in your house. Peas require no more than twenty minutes' 
boiling if young ; asparagus the same ; the latter should 
always be boiled in a saucepan deep enough to let it 
stand up in the water when tied up in bunches, for this 
saves the heads. Potatoes should be poured off the 
minute they are done, and allowed to stand at the back of 
the stove with a clean cloth folded over them. They are 
the only vegetable that should be put into cold water. 
When new, boiling water is proper. When quite ripe 
they are more floury if put in cold water. 

Soups. — As I have before said, I do not pretend to give 
many recipes, only to tell you how to succeed with the 
recipes given in other books. I shall, therefore, only 
give one recipe which I know is a novelty and one for the 
foundation of all soups. In one sense I have done the 
latter already. The stock for glaze is an excellent soup 
before it is reduced ; but I will also give Jules Gouffe's 
method of ma^vng jpot-au-feu, it being a most beautifully 
clear soup. 

It often happens, however, that you have sufficient 
stock from bones, trimmings of meat, and odds and ends 
of gravies, which may always be turned to account ; but 
the stock from such a source, although excellent, will 
not always be clear ; therefore, you must proceed with it 
in the following manner, unless you wish to use it for 
thick soup : 

Make your stock boiling hot and skim well ; then have 
ready the whites of three eggs (I am supposing you 
have three quarts of stock — one Q.gg to a quart), to which 
add half a pint of cold water ; whisk well together ; then 
add half a pint of the boiling stock gradually, still whisk- 



Boiling, 6y 

ing the eggs ; then stir the boiling stock rapidly, pouring 
in the whites of eggs, etc. ; as you do it, stir quickly till 
nearly boiling again, then take it from the fire, let it re- 
main till the whites of eggs separate ; then strain through 
a clean, fine cloth into a basin. This rule once learned 
will clear every kind of soup or jelly. 

There are many people who are good cooks, yet fail in 
clear soup, which is with them semi-opaque, while it 
should be like sherry. The cause of this opacity is gen- 
erally quick boiling while the meat is in. This gives it 
a milky appearance. After the stock is once made and 
clear, quick boiling will do no harm, but of course wastes 
the soup, unless resorted to for the purpose of making it 
stronger. A word here about coloring soup : Most per- 
sons resort to burnt sugar, and, very carefully used, it is 
not at all a bad makeshift. But how often have we a 
rich-looking soup put before us, the vermicelli appear- 
ing to repose under a lake of strong russet houillo7i, but 
which, on tasting, we find suggestive of nothing but 
burnt sugar and salt, every bit of flavor destroyed by the 
acrid coloring. Sometimes stock made by the recipe for 
poUau-feu (to follow) requires no color ; this depends 
on the beef ; but usually all soup is more appetizing in 
appearance for a little browning, and for this purpose I 
always use burnt onions in preference to anything else. 
If you have none in store when the soup is put on, put 
a small onion in the oven (or on the back of the stove ; 
should you be baking anything the odor would taint) ; 
turn it often till it gets quite black, but not charred. 
Then put it to the soup ; it adds a fine flavor as well as 
color, and you need not fear overdoing it. 

Soup that is to be reduced must be very lightly salted; 
for this reason salt is left out altogether for glaze, as the 



68 Culture and Cooking, 

reduction causes the water only to evaporate, the salt 
remains. 

Gouffe's Pot-au-Feu. — Four pounds of lean beef, 
six quarts of water, six ounces of carrot, six of turnip, 
six of onion, half an ounce of celery, one clove, salt. 

Put the meat on in cold water, and just before it 
comes to the boil skim it, and throw in a wineglass of 
cold water, skim again, and, when it is ^^ on the boil," 
again throw in another wineglass of cold water ; do this 
two or three times. The object of adding the cold water 
is to keep it just off the boil until all the scum has risen, 
as the boiling point is when it comes to the surface, yet 
once having boiled, the scum is broken up, and the soup 
is never so clear. 

The meat must simmer slowly, not toil, for three 
hours before the vegetables are added, then for a couple 
of hours more. 

It is necessary to be very exact in the proportions of 
vegetables ; but, of course, after having weighed them for 
Boups once or twice, you will get to know about the size 
of a carrot, turnip, etc., that will weigh six ounces. 
The exact weight is given until the eye is accustomed 
to it. 

This soup strained, and boiled down to one half, be- 
comes consomme. 

Celery Cream is a most delicious and little-known 
white soup, and all lovers of good things will thank me 
for introducing it. 

Have some nice veal stock, or the water in which 
chickens have been boiled, reduced till it is rich enough, 
will do, or some very rich mutton broth, but either of 
the former are preferable ; then put on a half cup of rice 
in a pint of rich milk, and grate into it the white part 



Boiling, 69 

and root of two heads of celery. Let the rice milk cook 
very slowly at the back of the stove, adding more milk 
before it gets at all stiff \ when tender enough to mash 
through a coarse sieve or fine colander add it to the 
stock, which must have been strained and be quite 
free from sediment, season with salt and a little wliite 
pepper or cayenne, boil all together gently a few min- 
utes. It should look like rich cream, and be strongly 
flavored with celery. Of course the quantity of rice, 
milk, and celery must depend on the quantity of stock 
you have. I have given the proportion for one quart, 
which, with the milk, etc., added, would make about 
three pints of soup. 



CHAPTER X. 

8AU0ES. 

Talleyrakd said England was a country with twen- 
ty-four religions and only one sauce. He miglit have 
said two sauces, and he would have been literally right 
as regards both England and America. Everything is 
served with brown sauce or white sauce. And how 
often the white sauce is like bookbinder's paste, the 
brown, a bitter, tasteless brown mess ! Strictly speak- 
ing, perhaps, the French have but two sauces either, 
espagnole, or brown sauce, and white sauce, which they 
call the mother sauces ; but what changes they ring on 
these mother sauces ! The espagnole once made, with no 
two meats is it served alike in flavor, and in this matter 
of flavor the artist appears. In making brown sauce for 
any purpose, bethink yourself of anything there may be 
in your store-room with which to vary its flavor, taking 
care that it shall agree with the meat for which it is in- 
tended. The ordinary cook flies at once to Worcester- 
shire or Harvey sauce, which are excellent at times, but 
'^ toujour s perdrix " is not always welcome. A pinch of 
mushroom powder, or a few chopped oysters, are excel- 
lent with beef or veal ; so will be a spoonful of ^lontpel- 
lier butter stirred in, or curry, not enough to yellow the 
sauce, but enough to give a dash of piquancy. A pic- 
kled walnut chopped, or a gherkin or two, go admirably 
with mutton or pork chops. In short, this is just where 

70 



Sauces, yi 

imagination and brains will tell in cooking, and little 
essays of invention may be tried witb profit. But be- 
ware of trying too much ; make yourself perfect in one 
thing before venturing on another. 

EsPAGXOLE, or brown sauce, is simply a rich stock well 
flavored with vegetables and herbs, and thickened with 
a piece of roux or with brown flour. 

White Sauce is one of those things we rarely find per- 
fectly made ; bad, it is the ne plus ultra of badness ; 
good, it is delicious. Those who have tried to have it 
good, and failed, I beg to try the following method of 
making it : Take an ounce and a half of butter and a 
scant tablespoonf ul of flour, mix both with a spoon into a 
paste ; when smooth add half a pint of warm milk, a small 
teaq)oonful of salt, and the sixth part of one of white pep- 
per ; set it on the fire till it boils, and is thick enough 
to mask the back of the spoon transparently ; then add a 
squeeze of lemon juice, and another ounce and a half of 
fresh butter ; stir this till quite blended. This sauce is 
the foundation for many others, and, for some purposes, 
the beaten yolk of an egg is introduced when just o5 
the boil. Capers may be added to it, or chopped mush- 
rooms, or chopped celery, or oysters, according to the 
use for which it is intended. The object of adding the 
second butter is because boiling takes away the flavor of 
butter ; by stirring half of it in, without boiling, you re- 
tain it. 



CHAPTER XL 

WARMING OVER. 

Hash is a peculiarly American institution. In no 
other country is eyery remnant of cold meat turned into 
that one unvarying dish. What do I say ? remnants of 
cold meat ! rather joints of cold meat, a roast of beef 
of which the tenderloin had sufficed for the first day's 
dinner, the leg of mutton from which a few slices only 
have been taken, the fillet of veal, available for so many 
delicate dishes, all are ruthlessly turned into the all- 
pervading hash. The curious thing is that people are 
not fond of it. Men exclaim against it, and its name 
stinks in the nostrils of those unhappy ones whose home 
is the boarding-house. 

Yet hash in itself is not a bad dish ; when I say it is 
a peculiarly American institution, I mean, that when 
English people speak of hash, they mean something 
quite different — meat warmed in slices. Our hash, in 
its best form — that is, made with nice gravy, garnished 
with sippets of toast and pickles, surrounded with 
mashed potatoes or rice — is dignified abroad by the name 
of mince, and makes its appearance as an elegant little 
entree. Nor would it be anathematized in the way it 
is witli us, if it were only occasionally introduced. It 
is the familiarity that has led to contempt. ''^But 
what shall I do?" asks the young wife distressfully; 

73 



Warming Over. 73 

^* John likes joints, and he and I and Bridget can't pos- 
sibly eat a roast at a meal." 

Very true ; and it is to just such perplexed young 
housekeepers that I hope this chapter will be especially 
useful— that is to say, small families with moderate 
means and a taste for good things. In this, as in many 
other ways, large families are easier to cater for ; they 
can consume the better part of a roast at a meal, and 
the remains it is no great harm to turn into hash, al- 
though even they might, with little trouble and expense, 
have agreeable variety introduced into their bill of fare. 

In England and America there is great prejudice 
against warmed-over food, but on the continent one eats 
it half the time in some of the most delicious-made 
dishes without suspecting it. Herein lies 4:he secret. 
With us and our transatlantic cousins the warming over 
is so artlessly done, that the hard fact too often stares 
at us from out the watery expanse in which it reposes. 

One great reason of the failure to make warmed-over 
meat satisfactory is the lack of gravy. On the goodness 
of this (as well as its presence) depends the success of 
your rechauffe. 

The. glaze, for which I have given the recipe, renders 
you at all times independent in this respect, but at the 
same time it should not alone be depended on. Every 
drop of what remains in the dish from the roast should 
be saved, and great care be taken of all scraps, bones, 
and gristle, which should be carefully boiled down to 
save the necessity of flying to the glaze for every pur- 
pose. I will here give several recipes, which I think 
may be new to many readers. 

Salmi of Cold Meat is exceedingly good. Melt butter 
in a saucepan, if for quite a small dish two ounces will 
4 



74 Culture and Cooking, 

be sufficient ; when melted, stir in a little flour to 
thicken ; let it brown, but not burn, or, if you are pre- 
paring the dish in haste, put in some brown flour ; then 
add a glass of white or red wine and a cup of broth, or a 
cup of water and a slice of glaze, a sprig or two of 
thyme, parsley, a small onion, chopped, and one bay 
leaf, pepper, and salt. Simmer all thoroughly (all 
savory dishes to which wine is added should simmer 
long enough for the distinct "winey" flavor to disap- 
pear, only the strength and richness remaining). Strain 
this when simmered half an hour and lay in the cold 
meat. Squeeze in a little lemon juice and draw the 
stew-pan to the back of the stove, but where it will cook 
no longer, or the meat will harden. Serve on toast, and 
pour the sauce over. A glass of brandy added to this 
dish when the meat goes in is a great addition, if an 
extra fine salmi is desired. By not allowing the flour 
and butter to brown and using white wine, this is a very 
fine sauce in which to warm cold chicken, veal, or any 
wliite meat. 

BcEUF A LA Jaediniere.— Put In a fireproof dish if 
you have it, or a thick saucepan, a pint of beef broth, a 
small bunch each of parsley, chervil, tarragon — very lit- 
tle of this — shallot or onion, capers, pickled gherkins, 
of each or any a teaspoonful chopped fine ; roll a large 
tablespoonful of butter with a dessert-spoonful of brown 
flour, stir it in ; then take slices of underdone beef, with 
a blunt knife hack each slice all over in fine dice, but 
not to separate or cut up the slices ; then pepper and 
salt each one and lay it in with the herbs, sprinkle a 
layer of herbs over the beef and cover closely ; then stand 
the dish in the oven to slowly cook for an hour, or, if 
you use a stew-pan, set in a pan of boiling water on the 



Warming Over, 75 

stove for an hour where the water will just boil. Serve 
on a dish surrounded with young carrots and turnips if 
in season, or old ones cut. 

Beef au Gratis. — Cut a little fat bacon or pork very 
thin, sprinkle on it chopped parsley, onion, and mush- 
rooms (mushroom powder will do) and bread-crumbs ; 
then put in layers of beef, cut thick, and well and closely 
hacked, then another layer of bacon or pork cut thin as 
a wafer, and of seasoning, crumbs last ; pour over enough 
broth or gravy to moisten well, in which a little brandy 
or wine may be added if an especially good dish is 
desired ; bake slowly an hour. 

PsEUDO Beefsteak. — Cut cold boiled or roast beef in 
thick slices, broil slowly, lay in a hot dish in which you 
have a large spoonful of Montpellier butter melted, 
sprinkle a little mushroom powder if you desire, and 
garnish with fried potato. 

Cutlets a la Jardiniere. — Trim some thick cutlets 
from a cold leg of mutton, or chops from the loin, dip 
them in frying batter, a la Car erne, fry crisp and quickly, 
and serve wreathed round green peas, or a ragout made as 
follows : Take young carrots, turnips, green peas, white 
beans ; stew gently in a little water to which the bones 
of the meat and trimmings have been added (and which 
must be carefully removed not to disfigure the vegeta- 
bles). Encircle this ragout with the fried cutlets, and 
crown with a cauliflower. 

Cromesquis of lamb is a Polish recipe. Cut some 
underdone lamb — mutton will of course do— quite small ; 
also some mushrooms, cut small, or the powder. Put in 
a saucepan apiece of glaze the size of a pigeon's egg, with 
a little water or broth, warm it and thicken with yolks 
of two eggs, just as you would make boiled custard, that 



;76 Culture and Cooking, 

is, without letting it come to the boil, or it will curdle; 
then add the mushrooms and meat, let all get cold, and 
divide it into small pieces, roll in bread-crumbs sifted, 
then in Qgg, then in crumbs again, and fry in yery hot 
fat; or you may, after rolling in bread-crumbs, lay each 
piece in a spoon and dip it into frying batter ; let the 
extra batter run off, and drop the cromesquis into the 
hot fat. These will be good made of beef and rolled up 
in a bard of fat pork cut thin, and fried; serve with sauce 
piquant made thus : Take some chopped parsley, onion, 
and pickled cucumbers, simmer till tender, and thicken 
with an equal quantity of butter and flour. Of course 
your own brightness will tell you that, if you are in 
haste, a spoonful of Montpellier butter, the same of flour, 
melted in a little water, to which you add a teaspoonful 
of vinegar, will make an excellent sauce piquant, and 
this same is excellent for anything fried, as breaded 
chops, croquettes, etc. I may here say, that where two 
or three herbs are mentioned as necessary, for instance, 
parsley, tarragon, and chervil, if you have no tarragon 
you must leave it out, or chervil the same. It is only a 
matter of flavoring, at the same time flavor is a great 
deal, and these French herbs give that indescribable 
cachet to a dish w^hich is one of the secrets of French 
cooking. Therefore if you are a wise matron you will 
have a supply on hand, even if only bought dry from the 
druggist. 

MiROTOK OF Beef. — Peel and cut into thin slices two 
large onions, put them in a stew-pan with two ounces of 
butter, place it over a slow fire ; stir the onions round till 
they are rather brown, but not in the least burnt ; add a 
teaspoonful of brown flour, mix smoothly, then moisten 
with half a pint of broth, or water with a little piece of 



Warming Over. 77 

glaze, three salt-spoonfuls of salt unless your broth was 
salted, then half the quantity or less, two of sugar, and 
one of pepper. Put in the cold beef, cut in thin slices 
as lean as possible, let it remain five minutes at the back 
of the stove ; then seiTe on a very hot dish garnished 
with fried potatoes, or sippets of toast. To vary the 
flavor, sometimes put a spoonful of tarragon or plain 
vinegar, or a teaspoonful of mushroom powder, or a 
pinch of curry, unless objected to, or a few sweet herbs. 
In fact, as you may see, variety is as easy to produce as 
it is rare to meet with in average cooking, and depends 
more on intelligence and thoughtfulness than on any- 
thing else. 

The simplest of all ways of warming a joint that is 
not far cut, is to wrap it in thickly buttered paper, and 
put it in the oven again, contriving, if possible, to cover 
it closely, let it remain long enough to get liot through, 
not to cook. By keeping it closely covered it will get 
hot through in less time, and the steam will prevent it 
getting hard and dry ; make some gravy hot and serve 
with the meat. If your gravy is good and plentiful, 
your meat will be as nice as the first day; without gravy 
it would be an unsatisfactory dish. If you cannot 
manage to cover the joint in the oven, you may put it in 
a pot over the fire without water, but with a dessert 
spoonful of vinegar to create steam ; let it get hot 
through, and serve as before. 

For the third day the meat may be warmed up in 
any of the ways I am going to mention, repeating once 
more, that you must have gravy of some kind, or else 
carefully make some, with cracked bones, gristle, etc., 
stewed long, and nicely flavored with any kii^d of 
sauce. 



7^ Culture and Cooking. 

Eagout.— A yery nice ragout may be made from cold 
meat thus : Slice the meat, put it in a stew-pan in which 
an onion, or several if you like them, has been sliced; 
squeeze half a lemon into it, or a dessert-spoonful of vine- 
gar, cover closely without water, and when it begins to 
cook, set the stew-pan at the back of the stove for three 
quarters of an hour, shaking it occasionally. The onions 
should now be brown; take out the meat, dredge in a little 
flour, stir it round, and add a cup of gravy, pepper, salt, 
and a small quantity of any sauce or flavoring you prefer; 
stew gently a minute or two, then put the meat back to 
get hot, and serve; garnish with sippets of toast, or 
pickles. 

A NICE LITTLE BREAKFAST DISH is made thus : Cut 
two long slices of cold meat and three of bread, buttered 
thickly, about the same shape and size ; season the meat 
with pepper, salt, and a little finely chopped parsley; or, 
if it is veal, a little chopped ham ; then lay one slice of 
bread between two of meat, and have the other two slices 
outside ; fasten together with short wooden skewers. If 
you have a quick oven, put it in ; and take care to baste 
with butter thoroughly, that the bread may be all over 
crisp and brown. If you can't depend on your oven, fry 
it in very hot fat as you would crullers ; garnish with 
sprigs of parsley, and serve very hot. 

To Warm a Good-sized Piece of Beef. — Trim 
it as much like a thick fillet as you can ; cut it 
horizontally half way through, then scoop out as much 
as you can of the meat from the inside of each piece. 
Chop the meat fine that you have thus scooped out, 
season with a little finely chopped parsley and thyme, a 
shred of onion, if you like it; or if you have celery boil 
a little of the coarser part till tender, chop it and add 



Warming Over, 79 

as mnch bread finely crumbled as you have meat, and a 
good piece of butter ; add pepper and salt, and make all 
into a paste with an Qgg, mixed with an equal quantity 
of gravy or milk ; fill up the hollow in the meat and tie, 
or still better, sew it together. You may either put this 
in a pot with a slice of pork or bacon, and a cup of 
gravy; or you may brush it over with beaten egg, cover 
it with crumbs, and pour over these a cup of butter, 
melted, so that it moistens every part; and bake it, taking 
care to baste well while baking ; serve with nice gravy. 

Beef Olives are no novelty to the ear, but it is a 
novel thing to find them satisfactory to the palate. 

Take some stale bread-crumbs, an equal quantity of 
beef finely chopped, some parsley, and thyme ; a little 
scraped ham if you have it, a few chives, or a slice of 
onion, all chopped small as possible ; put some butter in 
a pan, and let this force-meat just simmer, not fry, in it 
for ten minutes. While this is cooking, cut some un- 
derdone oblong slices of beef about half an inch thick, 
hack it with a sharp knife on hoth sides ; then mix the 
cooked force-meat with the yolk of an egg and a table- 
spoonful of gravy ; put a spoonful of this paste in the 
center of each slice of meat and tie it up carefully in the 
shape of an egg. Then if you have some nice gravy, 
thicken it with a piece of butter rolled in flour, roll each 
olive slightly in flour and lay it in the gravy and let it 
very gently simmer for half an hour. A few chopped 
oysters added to the gravy will be a great addition. Or 
you may lay each olive on a thin slice of fat pork, roll it 
up, tie it, dip it in flour, and bake in a quick oven until 
beautifully brown. 

To Warm over Cold Mutton-. — An excellent and 
simple way is to cut it, if Idin, into chops, or leg, into 



8o Culture and Cooking. 

thick collops, and dip each into ^^g well beaten with a 
tablespoonful of milk, then mfine bread-crumbs and fry 
in plenty of very hot fat. 

If your crumbs are not very fine and eyen, the larger 
crumbs will fall off, and the appearance be spoilt. 
These chops will be almost as nice, if quickly fried, as 
fresh cooked ones. They will also be excellent if, instead 
of being breaded, they are dipped into thick batter (see 
recipe) and fried brown in the same way. This method 
answers for any kind of meat, chicken thus warmed over 
being especially good. The batter, or Qgg and bread- 
crumbs form a sort of crust which keeps it tender and 
juicy. Any attempt to fry cold meat without either re- 
sults in a hard, stringy, uneatable dish. 

White Meat of ajsy kind is excellent warmed over 
in a little milk, in which you have cut a large 
onion, and, if you like it, a slice of salt pork or 
ham, and a little sliced cucumber, if it is summer; 
thicken with the yolks of one or two eggs, added 
after the whole has simmered twenty minutes ; take 
care the egg thickens in the gravy, but does not hoil, 
or it will curdle. If it is in winter, chop a teaspoonful of 
pickled cucumber or capers and add just on going to 
table. In summer when you have the sliced cucumber, 
squeeze half a lemon into the gravy, the last thing, to 
give the requisite dash of acid. You may vary the above 
by adding sometimes a few chopped oysters ; at others, 
mushrooms, or celery. The last must be put in with 
the onion and before the meat. 

Deviled Meat. — Our better halves are usually fond 
of this, especially for breakfast or lunch. 

For this dish take a pair of turkey or chicken drumsticks 
or some nice thick wedges of underdone beef or mutton. 



Warming Over. 8 1 

score them deeply with a knife and rub them oyer -with 
a sauce made thus: A teaspoonful of vinegar, the same 
of Harvey or Worcestershire sauce, the same of mustard, 
a little cayenne, and a tablespoonful of salad oil, or but- 
ter melted ; mix all till liker cream, and take care your 
meat is thoroughly moistened all over with the mixture, 
then rub your gridiron with butter. See that the fire is 
clear, and while the gridiron is getting hot, chop a tea- 
spoonful of parsley very fine, mix it up with a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut, and lay this in a dish which 
you will put to get hot. Then put the meat to be grilled 
on the fire and turn often, so that it will not bum; when 
hot through and brown, lay it in the hot dish, lay an- 
other hot dish over it, and serve as quickly as possible 
with hot plates. 

Or the gi'ill may be served with what Soyer calls his 
Mepliistophelian sauce, which he especially designed for 
serving with deviled meats. Chop six shallots or small 
onions, wash and press them in the corner of a clean 
cloth, put them in a stew-pan with half a wineglass of 
chili vinegar (pepper sauce), a chopped clove, a tiny bit 
of_garlic, two bay leaves, an ounce of glaze; boil all to- 
gether ten minutes ; then add four tablespoonfuls of 
tomato sauce, a little sugar, and ten of broth thickened 
with roux (or water will do if you have no broth). 

It will be remarked that in many French recipes a 
little sugar is ordered. This is not meant to sweeten, or 
even be perceptible; but it enriches, softens, tones, as it 
were, the other ingredients as salt does. 

Soter's Feitadella (twenty recipes in one). — Put

water; take the same quantity of any kind of roast, or 

boiled meat, with a little fat, chop it fine, press the

bread in a clean cloth to extract the water ; put in a 
stew-pan two ounces of butter, a tablespoonful of chopped 
onions ; fry two minutes and stir, then add the bread, 
stir and fry till rather dry, then the meat ; season with a 
teaspoonful of salt, half of pepper, and a little grated nut- 
meg, and lemon peel; stir continually till very hot, then 
add two eggs, one at a time; mix well and pour on a dish 
to get cold. Then take a piece, shape it like a small ^gg, 
flatten it a little, Qgg and bread-crumb it all over, tak- 
ing care to keep in good shape. Do all the same way, 
then put into a frying-pan a quarter of a pound of lard 
or dripping, let it get hot, and put in the pieces, and 
saute (or as we call it ''fry") them a fine yellow brown. 
Serve very hot with a border of mashed potatoes, or any 
garniture you fancy. Sauce piquant, or not, as you 
please. 

The above can be made with any kind of meat, poul- 
try, game, fish, or even vegetables; hard eggs, or potatoes, 
may be introduced in small quantities, and they may be 
fried instead of sauteed (frying in the French and strict 
sense, meaning as I need hardly say, entire immersion in 
very hot fat). To fry them you require at least two 
pounds of fat in your pan. 

Oysters or lobsters prepared as above are excellent. 

Boileau says, '^ Un diner rechauffe ne valut ja7nais 
Hen." But I think a good French cook of the present 
day would make him alter his opinion. 

Indeed Savarin quotes a friend of his own, a notable 
gourmand, who considered spinach cooked on Monday 
only reached perfection the following Saturday, having 
each day of the week been warmed up with butter, and 
each day gaining succulence and a more marrowy consist- 
ency. 



Warming Over. 83 

The only trouble I find in relation to this part of my 
present task is the difficulty of knowing when to leave 
off. There are so many ways of warming meats to ad- 
vantage—and in every one way there is the suggestion 
for another — that I suffer from an emharras de richesse, 
and have had difficulty in selecting. Dozens come to my 
mind, blanquettes, patties, curries, as I write; but as 
this is not, I have said, to be a recipe book, I forbear. Of 
one thing I am quite sure : when women once know how to 
make nice dishes of cold meat they will live well where 
they now live badly, and for less money; and *'hash" will 
be relegated to its proper place as an occasional and ac- 
ceptable dish. 



CHAPTEE XII. 

OK FRIANDISES. 

*' Le role du gourmand finit avec Tentremets, et celui du friand 
commence au dessert. — Grimod de la Reyniere. 

American ladies, as a rule, excel in cake making and 
preserving, and I feel that on that head I have very little 
to teach ; indeed, were they as accomplished in all 
branches of cooking as in making dainty sweet dishes 
this book would be uncalled for. 

Yet, notwithstanding their undoubted taste and ability 
in making ^'friandises,''^ it seems to me a few recipes 
borrowed from what the French call la grande cuisine, 
and possible of execution at home, will be welcome to 
those who wish to vary the eternal ice cream and char- 
lotte russe, with other sweets more elegant and likely to 
be equally popular. 

Iced Souffle a la Byeok. — One pint of sugar 
syrup of 32 degrees (get this at a druggist's if 
you do not understand sugar boiling), three gills of 
strained raspberry juice, one lemon, one gill of maras- 
chino, fifteen yolks of eggs, two ounces of chocolate 
drops, half a pint of very thick cream whipped. 

Method of making this and the next recipe is as follows: 
Mix the syrup and yolks of eggs, strain into a warm 
bowl, add the raspberry and lemon juice and maras- 
chino, whisk till it creams well, then take the bowl out 

84

of the hot water and whisk ten minutes longer ; add the 
chocolate drops and whipped cream ; lightly fill a case 
or mold, and set in a freezer for two hours, then coyer 
the surface with lady-fingers (or sponge cake) dried in 
the oven a pale brown, and rolled. Serve at once. 

Another frozen souffle is as follows : 

One pint of syrup, 32 degrees, half a pint of noyeau, 
half a pint of cherry juice, two ounces of bruised 
macaroons, half a pint of thick cream whipped, made in 
the same way as the last. I may here say that the fruit 
juices can be procured now at all good druggists, so that 
these souffles are very attainable in winter, and as noy- 
eau and maraschino do not form part of the stores in a 
family of small means, I will give in this chapter recipes 
for the making of very fair imitations of the genuine 
liqueurs. 

Biscuit Glace a la Charles Dicken^s. — One pint 
of sjrrap (32°), fifteen yolks of eggs, three gills of peach 
pulp, colored pink with cochineal, one gill of noyeau, 
half a pint of thick cream, and a little chocolate water- 
ice, made with half a pint of syrup and four ounces of 
the best chocolate smoothly mixed and frozen ready. 

Mix syrup, yolks, peach pulps, noyeau, and a few 
drops of vanilla, whip high ; mix with the whipped 
cream, and set in ice for one hour and a half in brick- 
shaped molds, then turn out (if very firm), and cut in 
slices an inch thick, and coat them all over, or on top 
and sides, with the chocolate ice, smoothing with a knife 
dipped in cold water ; serve in paper cases. 

Biscuit Glace a la Thackeray. — One pint of syrup 
(32°), one pint of strawberry pulp, fifteen yolks of eggs, 
one ounce of vanilla sugar (flavor a little sugar with va- 
nilla), half a pint of thick cream. 



86 Culture and Cooking, 

Mix syrup, yolks, strawberry, and yanilla sugar, whip- 
ping as before, then add the whipped cream lightly ; fill 
paper cases, either round or square ; surround each with 
a band of stiff paper, to reach half an inch above the 
edge of the case, the bands to be pinned together to se- 
cure them ; place them in a freezer. Wlien about to send 
to table, remove the bands of paper, and cover with 
macaroons bruised fine and browned in the oven. The 
bands of paper are meant to give the biscuit the appear- 
ance of having risen while supposed to bake. 

These delicious ices were invented by Francatelli, the 
Queen of England's chief cook, to do homage to the 
different great men whose names they bear, on the occa- 
sion of preparing dinners given in their honor. They 
read as if somewhat intricate, but any lady who has ever 
had ice cream made at home, and had the patience to 
make charlotte russe, need not shrink appalled before 
these novelties, or fear for a successful result. 

Baba is a cake many call for at a confectioner's, yet 
few, if any one, attempts to make it at home. That 
the recipes generally offered do not lead to success may be 
one reason, and I offer the following, quite sure, if ac- 
curately followed, such a baba will result as never was 
eaten outside of Paris. 

Baba. — One pound of flour ; take one quarter of it, 
and make a sponge with half an ounce of compressed 
yeast and a little warm water, set it to rise, make a hole 
in the rest of the flour, add to it ten ounces of butter, 
three eggs, and a dessert-spoonful of sugar, a little salt, 
unless your butter salts it enough, which is generally 
the case. Beat all together well, then add five more eggs, 
one at a time, that is to say, add one ^gg and beat well, 
then another and beat again, and so on until the five are 



On Friandises, 8/ 

used. Wlien the paste leayes the bowl it is beaten 
enough, but not before ; then add the sponge to it, and 
a large half ounce of citron cliopped, the same of cur- 
rants, and an ounce and a half of sultana raisins, seed- 
less. Let it rise to twice its size, then bake it in an oven 
of dark yellow paper heat ; the small round babas are an 
innovation of the pastry-cook to enable him to sell them 
uncut. But the baba proper should be baked in a large, 
deep, upright tin, such as a large charlotte russe mold, 
when they keep for several days fresh, and if they get 
stale, make delicious fritters, soaked in sherry and 
dipped in frying batter. 

In some cases, however, it may be preferred to make 
them as usually seen at French pastry cooks ; for this 
purpose you require a dozen small-sized round char- 
lotte russe molds, which fill half full only, as they 
rise very much ; bake these in a hotter oven, light brown 
paper heat; try with a twig as you would any other cake, 
if it comes out dry it is done ; then prepare a syrap as 
follows : Boil half pound of sugar in a pint of water, add 
to this the third of a pint of rum, and some apricot 
pulp — peach will of course do — and boil all together a 
few minutes ; pour this half an inch deep in a dish, and 
stand the cake or cakes in it ; it should drink up all the 
syrup, you may also sprinkle some over it. If any symp 
remains, use it to warm over your cake when stale, 
instead of the sherry. 

Baba was introduced into France by Stanislas Lec- 
zinski, king of Poland, and the father-in-law of Louis 
XIV. ; and his Polish royal descendanta»still use with 
it, says Careme, a syrup made of Malaga wine and 
one sixth part of eau de tanaisie. 

But, although our forefathers seemed to have relished 



SB Culture and Cooking. 

tansy yery much, to judge from old recipe books, I 
doubt if such flavoring would be appreciated in our 
time. 

Savarins— commonly called wine cake by New York 
pastry cooks — are made as follows : 

One pound of flour, of which take one quarter to make 
a sponge, using half an ounce of Grerman compressed yeast, 
and a little warm milk ; when it has risen to twice its 
bulk, add one gill of hot milk, two eggs, and the rest of 
the flour ; mix well ; then add one more Qgg and beat, 
another, still beating; then add three quarters of a 
pound of fresh butter, a quarter of an ounce of salt, half 
an ounce of sugar, and half a gill of hot milk, beat well; 
then add eggs, one at a time, beating continually, until 
you have used five more. Out in small dice three ounces 
of candied orange peel; butter a tin, which should be deep 
and straight-sided — a tin pudding boiler is not a bad 
thing — and sprinkle with chopped almonds. Fill the 
mold half full, and when risen to twice its bulk, bake in 
a moderate oven, dark yellow paper heat. When served, 
this cake should stand in a dish of syrup, flavored with 
rum, as for baba, or with sherry wine. 

BoucHEES DES Dames, a very ornamental and delicious 
little French cake, is sufiBciently novel to deserve a place 
here, I think. Make any nice drop cake batter (either 
sponge, or sponge with a little butter in it I prefer) ; drop 
one on buttered paper and bake ; if it runs, beat in a 
little more flour and sugar, but not much, or your cakes 
will be brittle ; they should be the size, when done, of a 
fifty-cent pieces and I find half a teaspoonf ul of batter 
dropped generally makes them about right. Have a 
tin cutter or tin box lid, if you have no cutter so small, 
about the size, and with it trim each cake when baked ; 



On Friandises, 89 

then take half the number and spread some with a very 
thin layer of red currant jelly, others with peach or 
raspberry ; then on each so spread put a cake that is 
unspread, thus making a tiny sandwich or jelly cake. 
If you have different sorts of jelly, put each separate, a^ 
you must adapt the flavor of your icing to the jelly. 
For red currant, ice with chocolate icing. Eecipes for 
icing are so general that I refer you to your cookery 
book. Those with peach may have white icing, flavored 
with almond, or with rum, beating in a little more 
sugar if the flavoring dilutes your icing too much. Al- 
mond flavoring goes well with raspberry. Cakes with 
raspberry jelly or jam should be iced pink, coloring the 
icing with prepared cochineal or cranberry juice. Thus 
you have your cakes brown, pink, and white, which look 
very pretty mixed. 

The process of icing is difficult to do after they are put 
together, but they are much handsomer this way, and 
keep longer. You require, to accomplish it, a good 
quantity of each kind of icing, and a number of little 
wooden skewers ; stick one into each cake and dip it 
in the icing, let it run off, then stand the other end of 
the skewer in a box of sand or granulated sugar. The 
easiest way is to ice each half cake before putting in 
the jelly ; when the icing is hard spread with jelly, and 
put together. 

CURA90A may be successfully imitated by pouring over 
eight ounces of the thinly pared rind of very ripe 
oranges a pint of boiling water, cover, and let it cool ; 
then add two quarts of brandy, or strong French spirit, 
cover closely, and let it stand fourteen days, shaking it 
every day. Make a clarified syrup of two pounds of 
sugar into one pint of water, well boiled ; strain the

brandy into it, leaving it coyered close another day. 
Eub up in a mortar one drachm of potash, with a 
teaspoonful of the liqueurs ; when well blended, put this 
into the liqueur, and in the same way pound and add 
a drachm of alum, shake well, and in an hour or two 
filter through thin muslin. Eeady for use in a week or 
two. 

Makaschiko . — Bruise slightly a dozen cherry kernels, 
put them in a deep jar with the outer rind of three or- 
anges and two lemons, cover with two quarts of gin, then 
add syrup and leave it a fortnight, as for cura9oa. Stir 
syrup and spirit together, leave it another day, run it 
through a jelly bag, and bottle. Keady to use in ten 
days. 

NoYEAU. — Blanch and pound two pounds of bitter al- 
monds, or four of peach kernels ; put to them a gallon of 
spirit or brandy, two pounds of white sugar candy — or 
sugar will do— a grated nutmeg, and a pod of vanilla ; 
leave it three weeks covered close, then filter and bottle ; 
but do not use it for three months. To be used with 
caution. 



CHAPTEE XIII. 

FEENCH CAiq^DY AT HOME. 

This chapter I shall have to make one of recipes 
chiefly, for it treats of a branch of cooking not usually 
found in cookery books, or at least there is seldom any- 
thing on the art of confectionery beyond molasses or 
cream taffy and nougat. These, therefore, I shall not 
touch upon, but' rather show you how to make the ex- 
pensive French candies. 

The great art of making these exquisite candies is in 
boiling the sugar, and it is an art easily acquired with, 
patience. 

Put into a marbleized saucepan (by long experience in 
Bugar-boiling I find them less likely to bum even than 
brass, and I keep one for the purpose) one pound of 
sugar and half a pint of water ; when it has boiled ten 
minutes begin to try it ; have a bowl of water with a 
piece of ice near you, and drop it from the end of a 
spoon. TVTien it falls to the bottom, and you can take it 
up and make it into a softish ball (not at all sticky) be- 
tween your thumb and finger, it is at the right point ; 
remove it from the fire to a cold place ; when cool, if 
perfectly right, a thin jelly-like film will be over the 
surface, not a sugary one ; if it is sugary, and you want 
your candy very creamy, you must add a few spoonfuls 
of water, return to the fire and boil again, going through. 

91 



92 Culture and Cooking. 

the same process of trying it. You must be careful that 
there is not the least inclination to be brittle in the ball 
of candy you take from the water ; if so, it is boiled a 
degree too high ; put a little water to bring it back again, 
and try once more. A speck of cream of tartar is use- 
ful in checking a tendency in the syrup to go to sugar. 
"When you have your sugar boiled just right set it to 
cool, and when you can bear your finger in it, begin to 
beat it with a spoon-; in ten minutes it will be a white 
paste resembling lard, which you will find you can work 
like bread dough. This, then, is your foundation, 
called by French confectioners fondant ; with your fon- 
dant you can work marvels. But to begin with the 
simplest French candies. 

Take a piece of fondant, flavor part of it with vanilla, 
part of it with lemon, color yellow (see coloring can- 
dies), and another part with raspberry, color pink ; make 
these into balls, grooved cones, or anything that strikes 
your fancy, let them stand till they harden, they are 
then ready for use. 

Take another part of yo^xY fondant, have some English 
walnuts chopped, flavor with vanilla and color pink; 
work the walnuts into the paste as you would fruit into 
a loaf cake ; when mixed, make a paper case an inch 
wide and deep, and three or four inches long ; oil it ; 
press the paste into it, and when flrm turn it out and cut 
into cubes. Or, instead of walnuts, use chopped al- 
monds, flavor with vanilla, and leave the fondant white. 
This makes Vanilla Almoi^-d Cream. 

TuTTi FiiUTTi Candy. — Chop some almonds, citron, 
a fetff currants, and seedless raisins ; work into some 
fondant, flavor with rum and lemon, thus making Eo- 
man punch, or with vanilla or rasj)berry ; press into the 



French Candy at Home. 93 

paper forms as you did the walnut cream. You see how 
you can ring the changes on these bars, varying the 
flavoring, inventing new combinations, etc. 

FoKDANT PAif ACHE. — Take -^oxxY fondant, divide it in 
three equal parts, color one pink and flavor as you choose, 
leave the other white and flavor also as you please ; 
but it must agree with the pink, and both must agree 
with the next, which is chocolate. Melt a little un- 
sweetened chocolate by setting it in a saucer over the 
boiling kettle, then take enough of it to make your third 
piece of fondant a fine brown ; now divide the white 
into two parts ; make each an inch and a half wide, and 
as long as it will ; do the same with the chocolate fon- 
dant ; then take the pink, make it the same width and 
length, but of course, not being divided, it will be twice 
as thick ; now butter slightly the back of a plate, or, 
better still, get a few sheets of waxed paper from the 
confectioner's ; lay one strip of the chocolate on it, then 
a strip of white on that, then the pink, the other white, 
and lastly the chocolate again ; then lightly press them 
to make them adhere, but not to squeeze them out of 
shape. You have now an oblong brick of parti-colored 
candy ; leave it for a few hours to harden, then trim it 
neatly with a knife and cut it crosswise into slices half 
an inch think, lay on waxed paper to dry, turning once 
in a while, and pack away in boxes. 

If jour fondant gets very hard while you work, stand 
it over hot water a few minutes. 

Creamed candies are very fashionable just now, and, 
your fondant once ready, are very easy to make. 

Cream Walnuts. — Make ready some almonds, some 
walnuts in halves, some hazelnuts, or anything of the 
sort you fancy ; let them be very dry. Hdke fondant made 



94 Culture and Cooking. 

from a pound of sugar, set it in a bowl in a saucepan of 
boiling water, stirring it till it is like cream. Then having 
flavored it with vanilla or lemon, drop in your nuts one 
by one, taking them out with the other hand on the end 
of a fork, resting it on the edge of your bowl to drain for 
a second, then drop the nut on to a waxed or buttered 
paper neatly. If the nut shows through the cream it is 
too hot ; take it out of the boiling water and beat till it 
is just thick enough to mask the nut entirely, then re- 
turn it to the boiling water, as it cools very rapidly and 
becomes unmanageable, when it has to be warmed over 
again. 

Veky fine chocolate ckeams are made as follows : 
Boil half a pound of sugar with three tablespoonfuls of 
thick cream till it makes a soft ball in water, then let it 
cool. When cool beat it till it is very white, flavor with a 
few drops of vanilla and make it into balls the size of a large 
pea; then take some unsweetened chocolate warmed, mix 
it with a piece qI fondant melted — there should be more 
chocolate than sugar — and when quite smooth and thick 
enough to mask the cream, drop them in from the end 
of a fork, take them out, and drop on to wax paper. 

Another very fine candy to be made without heat, 
and therefore convenient for hot weather, is made as 
follows : 

Punch Drops.— Sift some powdered sugar. Have 
ready some fine white gum-arabic, put a tablespoonful 
with the sugar (say half a pound of sugar), and make it 
into a firm paste ; if too wet, add more sugar, flavor with 
lemon and a tiny speck of tartaric acid or a very little lem- 
on juice. Make the paste into small balls, then take more 
sugar and make it into icing with a spoonful of Santa 
Cruz rum and half the white of an Qgg, Try if it 



French Candy at Home, 95 

hardens, if not, beat in more sugar and color it a bright 
pink, then dip each ball in the pink icing and harden 
on wax paper. These are very novel, beautiful to look 
at, and the flavors may vary to taste. 

To MAKE Cochineal Coloeikg which is quite 
Harmless. — Take one ounce of powdered cochineal, 
one ounce of cream of tartar, two drachms of alum, 
half a pint of water ; boil the cochineal, water, and 
cream of tartar till reduced to one half, then add the 
alum, and put up in small bottles for use. Yellow is 
obtained by the infusion of Spanish saffron in a little 
water, or a still better one from the grated rind of a 
ripe orange put into muslin, and a little of the juice 
squeezed through it. 

Be careful in boiling the sugar for fondant, not to stir 
it after it is dissolved ; stirring causes it to become rough 
instead of creamy. 



CHAPTER XIV. 

A CHAPTER FOR PEOPLE OF YERY SMALL MEAKS. 

I AM sorry to say in these days this chapter may ap- 
peal to many, who are yet not to be called "poor peo- 
ple/' who may have been well-to-do and only suffering 
from the pressure of the times, and for whose cultivated 
appetites the coarse, substantial food of the laboring man 
(even if they could buy it) would not be eatable, who 
must have what they do have good, or starve. But, as 
some of the things for which I give recipes will seem 
over-economical for people who can afford to buy meat 
at least once a day, I advise those who have even fifty 
dollars a month income to skip it ; reminding them, if 
they do not, "that necessity knows no law." 

A bone of soup meat can be got at a good butcher's 
for ten or fifteen cents, and is about the best invest- 
ment, for that sum I know of, as two nourishing and 
savory meals, at least, for four or five persons can be 
got from it. 

Carefully make a nice soup, with plenty of vegetables, 
rice, or any other thickening you like. Your bone will 
weigh from four to six pounds, perhaps ; put it on with 
water according to size, and let it boil down slowly until 
nice and strong. If you have had any scraps of meat or 
bones, put them also to your soup. 

When you serve it, keep back a cup of soup and a few 

96 



Chapter for People of Very Small Means, 97 

of the Yege tables, and save the meat, from which you 
can make a very appetizing hash in the following way : 
Take the meat from the bone, chop it with some cold 
potatoes and the vegetables you saved from the soup. 
Cold stewed onions, boiled carrots or turnips, all help to 
make the dish savory. Chop an onion very fine, unless 
you have cold ones, a little parsley and thyme, if liked, 
and sometimes, for variety's sake, if you have it, a pinch 
of curry powder, not enough to make it hot or yellow, 
yet to impart piquancy. If you have a tiny bit of fried 
bacon or cold ham or cold pork, chop it with the other 
ingredients, mix all well, moisten with the cold soup, 
and, when nicely seasoned, put the hash into an iron 
frying-pan, in which you have a little fat made hot ; 
pack it smoothly in, cover it with a pot-lid, and either 
set it in a hot oven, or leave it to brown on the stove. 
If there was more soup than enough to moisten the hash, 
put it on in a tiny saucepan, with a little brown flour 
made into a paste with butter, add a drop of tomato cat- 
sup, or a little stewed tomato, or anything you have for 
flavoring, and stir till it boils. Then turn the hash out 
whole on a dish, it should be brown and crisp, pour the 
gravy you have made round it, and serve. For a change 
make a pie of the hash, pouring the gravy in through 
a hole in the top when done. 

It is not generally known that a very nice plain paste 
can be made with a piece of bread dough, to which you 
have added an q^^^^, and some lard, dripping, or butter. 
The dripping is particularly nice for the hash pie, and, 
as you need only a piece of dough as large as an orange, 
you will probably have enough from the soup, if you 
skimmed off all the fat before putting the vegetables in 
{^QQ pot-au'feu) ; work your dripping into the dough,

and let it rise well, then roll as ordinary pie-crust. Po- 
tato crust is also very good for plain pies of any sort, but 
as there are plenty of recipes for it, I will not give one 
here. 

One of the very best hashes I ever ate was prepared 
by a lady who, in better times, kept a very fine table. 
And she told me there were a good many cold beans 
in it, well mashed ; and often since, when taking "trav- 
elers' hash" in an hotel, I have thought of that savory 
dish with regret. 

Instead of making your chopped meat into hash, vary 
it, by rolling the same mixture into egg-shaped pieces, 
or flat cakes, flouring them, and frying them nicely in 
very hot fat ; pieces of pork or bacon fried and laid 
round will help out the dish, and be an improvement 
to what is already very good. 

To return once more to the soup bone. If any one of 
your family is fond of marrow, seal up each end of the 
bone with a paste made of flour and water. "When done, 
take off the paste, and remove the marrow. Made very 
hot, and spread on toast, with pepper and salt, it will be 
a relish for some one's tea or breakfast. 

In this country there is a prejudice against sheep's 
liver ; while in England, where beef liver is looked upon 
as too coarse to eat (and falls to the lot of the "cats- 
meat man," or cat butcher), sheep's is esteemed next to 
calf's, and it is, in fact, more delicate than beef liver. 
The nicest way to cook it is in very thin slices (not the 
inch-thick pieces one often sees), each slice dipped in 
flour and fried in pork or bacon fat, and pork or bacon 
served with it. But the more economical way is to put 
it in a pan, dredge it with flour, pin some fat pork over 
it, and set it in a hot oven ; when very brown take it out ; 



Chapter for People of Very Small Means. 99 

make nice brown gravy by pouring water in tbe pan and 
letting it boil on the stove, stirring it well to dissolve the 
glaze ; pour into the dish, and serve. The heart should 
be stuffed with bread-crumbs, parsley, thyme, and a lit- 
tle onion, and baked separately. Oi-, for a change, you 
may chop the liver up with a few sweet herbs and a lit- 
tle pork (onion, or not, as you like), and some bread- 
crumbs. Put all together in a crock, dredge with flour, 
cover, and set in a slow oven for an hour and a half ; 
then serve, with toasted bread around the dish. 

It is very poor economy to buy inferior meat. One 
pound of fine beef has more nounshment than two of 
poor quality. But there is a great difference in prices of 
different parts of meat, and it is better management to 
choose the cheap part of fine beef than to buy the sir- 
loin of a poor ox even at the same price ; and, by good 
cooking many parts not usually chosen, and therefore 
sold cheaply, can be made very good. Yet you must 
remember, that a piece of meat at seven cents a pound, 
in wliich there is at least half fat and bone, such as 
brisket, etc., is less economical than solid meat at ten or 
twelve. 

Pot roasts are very good for parts of meat not tender 
enough for roasting, the "cross-rib," as some butch- 
ers term it, being very good for this purpose ; it is all 
solid meat, and being very lean, requires a little fat pork, 
which may be laid at the bot*om of the pot; or better 
still, holes made in the meat and pieces of the fat drawn 
through, larding in a rough way, so that they cut to- 
gether. A pot roast is best put on in an iron pot, with- 
out water, allowed to get finely brown on one side, then 
turned, and when thoroughly brown on the other a little 
water may be added for gravy ; chop parsley or any 



100 Culture and Cooking, 

seasoning that is preferred. Give your roast at least 
three hours to cook. Ox cheek, as the head is called, is 
very good, and should be very cheap ; prepare it thus : 

Clean the cheek, soak it in water six hours, and cut 
the meat from the bones, which break up for soup; 
then take the meat, cut into neat pieces, put it in an 
earthen crock, a layer of beef, some thin pieces of pork 
or bacon, some onions, carrots, and turnips, cut thin, or 
chopped fine, and sprinkled over the meat ; also, some 
chopped parsley, a little thyme, and bay leaf, pepper 
and salt, and a clove to each layer ; then more beef and 
a little pork, vegetables, and seasoning, as before. When 
all your meat is in pour over it, if you have it, a tum- 
bler of hard cider and one of water, or else two of water, 
in which put a half gill of vinegar. If you have no 
tight-fitting cover to your crock, put a paste of flour and 
water over it to keep the steam in. Place the crock in a 
slow oven five or six hours, and when it is taken out re- 
move the crust and skim. Any piece of beef cooked in 
this way is excellent. 

Ox heart is one of the cheapest of dishes, and really 
remarkably nice, and it is much used by economical peo- 
ple abroad. 

The heart should be soaked in vinegar and water three 
or four hours, then cut off the lobes and gristle, and 
stuff it with fat pork chopped, bread-crumbs, parsley, 
thyme, pepper, and salt ; then tie it in a cloth and very 
slowly simmer it (large end up) for two hours ; take it 
up, remove the cloth, and flour it, and roast it a nice 
brown. Lay in the pan in which it is to be roasted some 
fat pork to baste it. Any of this left over is excellent 
hashed, or, warmed in slices with a rich brown gravy, can- 
not be told from game. Another way is to stuff it with 



Chapter for People of Very Small Means, lOi 

sage and onions. It must always be served very hot with 
hot plates and on a very hot dish. 

Fore quarter of mutton is another yery economical part 
of meat, if you get your butcher to cut it so that it may 
not only be economical, but really afford a choice joint. 
Do not then let him hack the shoulder across, but, before 
he does a thing to it, get him to take the shoulder out in 
a round plate-shaped joint, with knuckle attached ; if 
he does this well, that is, cuts it close to the bone of the 
ribs, you will have a nice joint ; then do not have it 
chopped at all ; this should be roasted in the oven very 
nicely, and served with onion sauce or stewed onions. If 
onions are not liked, mashed turnips are the appro- 
priate vegetable. This joint, to be enjoyed, must be 
properly carved, and that is, across the middle from the 
edge to the bone, the same as a leg of mutton ; and like 
the leg, you must learn, as I cannot describe it in words, 
where the bone lies, then have that side nearest you and 
cut from the opposite side. 

You have, besides this joint, another roast from the 
ribs, or else cut it up into chops till you come to the 
part under the shoulder ; from this the breast should be 
separated and both either made into a good Irish stew, 
or the breast prepared alone in a way I shall describe, 
the neck and thin ribs being stewed or boiled. 

The neck of mutton is very tender boiled and served 
with parsley or caper sauce ; the liquor it is boiled in 
served as broth, with vegetables and rice, or prepared as 
directed in a former chapter for the broth from leg of 
mutton. 

The mode I am about to give of preparing breast of 
mutton was told me by a Welsh lady of rank, at whose 
table I ate it (it appeared as a side dish), and who said. 



102 Culture and Cooking, 

half laughingly, '' Will you take some ' fluff ' ? We are 
very fond of it, but breast of mutton is such a despised 
dish I never expect any one else to like it.*' I took it, 
on my principle of trying everything, and did find it 
very good. This lady told me that, having of course a 
good deal of mutton killed on her father's estate, and the 
breast being always despised by the servants, she had in- 
vented a way of using it to avoid waste. Her way was this: 

Set the breast of mutton on the fire whole, just cov- 
ered with water in which is a little salt. When it comes 
to the boil draw it back and let it simmer three hours ; 
then take it up and draw out the bones, and lay a force- 
meat of bread-crumbs, parsley, thyme, chopped suet, 
salt and pepper all over it ; double or roll it, skewer it, 
and coat it thickly with Q^;g and bread-crumbs ; then 
bake in a moderate oven, basting it often with nice drip- 
ping or butter ; when nicely brown it is done, and eats 
like the tenderest lamb. It was, when I saw it, served on 
a bed of spinach. I like it better on a bed of stewed 
onions. 

I now give some dishes made without meat. 

Ragout of Cucumber and Okioks. — Fry equal 
quantities of large cucumbers and onions in slices until 
they are a nice brown. The cucumber will brown more 
easily if cut up and put to drain some time before using ; 
then flour each slice. When both are brown, pour on 
them a cup of water, and let them stew for half an hour ; 
then take a good piece of butter in which you have 
worked a dessert-spoonful of flour (browned) ; add pep- 
per, salt, and a little tomato catsup or stewed tomato. 
This is a rich-eating dish if nicely made, and will help 
out cold meat or a scant quantity of it very well. A 
little cold meat may be added if you have it. 



Chapter for People of Very Small Means, 103 

Onion Soup. — Fry six large onions cut into slices 
with a quarter of a pound of butter till they are of a 
bright brown, then well mix in a tablespoonful of flour, 
and pour on them rather more than a quart of water. 
Stew gently until the onions are quite tender, season 
with a spoonful of salt and a little sugar ; stir in quickly 
a liaison made with the yolks of two eggs mixed with 
a gill of milk or cream (do not let it boil afterwards), 
put some toast in a tureen, and serve very hot. 

Pea Soup. — Steep some yellow split peas all night, next 
morning set them on to boil with two quarts of water to a 
pint of peas ; in the water put a tiny bit of soda. In an- 
other pot put a large carrot, a turnip, an onion, and a 
large head of celery, all cut small and covered with water. 
When both peas and vegetables are tender, put them 
together, season with salt, pepper, and a little sugar, 
and let them gently stew till thick enough ; then strain 
through a colander, rubbing the vegetables well, and 
return to the pot while you fry some sippets of bread a 
crisp brown ; then stir into the soup two ounces of but- 
ter in which you have rolled a little flour. 

This soup is simply delicious, and the fact of it being 
maigre will not be remembered. 

Potato Soup is another of this good kind, for meat is 
scarcely required, so good is it without. 

Boil some potatoes, then rub them through a colandar 
into two quarts of hot milk (skimmed does quite well); 
have some fine-chopped parsley and onion, add both 
with salt and pepper, stew three quarters of an hour ; 
then stir in a large piece of butter, and beat two eggs 
with a little cold milk, stir in quickly, and serve with 
fried bread. There should be potatoes enough to make 
the soup as thick as cream. 



104 Culture and Cooking, 

Do not be prejudiced against a dish because there is 
no meat in it, and you think it cannot be nourishing. 
This chapter is not written for those with whom meat, 
or money, is plentiful ; and if it be true that man is 
nourished " not by what he eats, but by what he assim- 
ilates," and, according to an American medical author- 
ity, "what is eaten with distaste is not assimilated" 
(Dr. Hall), it follows that an enjoyable dinner, even 
without meat, will be more nourishing than one forced 
down because it lacks savor ; that potato soup will be 
more nourishing than potatoes and butter, with a cup of 
milk to drink, because more enjoyable. Yet it costs no 
more, for the soup can be made without the eggs if they 
are scarce. 

Or say bread and butter and onions. They will not 
be very appetizing, especially if they had to be a fre- 
quent meal, yet onion soup is made from the same ma- 
terials, and in France is a very favorite dish, even with 
those well able to put meat in it if they wished. 



CHAPTER XV, 

A FEW THINGS IT IS WELL TO KEMEMBER. 

Eyery housekeeper has pet ** wrinkles " of her own 
which she thinks are especially valuable ; some are 
known to all the world, others are new to many. So 
it may be with mine ; but, on the chance that some few 
things are as new to my friends as they were to me, I 
jot them down without any pretense of order or regu- 
larity. 

Lemons will keep fresher and better in water than any 
other way. Put them in a crock, cover them with water. 
They will in winter keep two or three months, and the 
peel be as fresh as the day they were put in. Take care, 
of course, that they do not get frosted. In summer 
change the water twice a week ; they will keep a long 
time. 

In grating nutmegs begin at the flower end ; if you 
commence at the other, there will be a hole all the way 
through. 

Tea or coffee made hot (not at all scorched), before 
water is added, are more fragrant and stronger. Thus, 
by putting three spoonfuls of tea in the pot and setting 
in a warm place before infusing, it will be as strong as 
if you make tea with four spoonfuls without warming it, 
and much more fragrant. 

Vegetables that are strong can be made much milder 
5* 105 



io6 Culture and Cooking, 

by tying a bit of bread in a clean rag and boiling it with 
them. 

Bread dough is just as good made the day before it is 
used ; thus, a small family can have fresh bread one day, 
rolls the next, by putting the dough in a cold place en- 
veloped in a damp cloth. In winter, kept cold, yet not 
in danger of freezing, it will keep a week. 

Celery seed takes the place of celery for soup or stews 
when it is scarce ; parsley seed of parsley. 

Green beans, gherkins, etc., put down when plentiful 
in layers of rock salt, will keep crisp and green for 
months, and can be taken out and pickled when con- 
venient. 

Lemon or orange peel grated and mixed with powdered 
sugar and a squeeze of its own Juice (the sugar making 
it into paste) is excellent to keep for flavoring ; put it 
into a little pot and it will keep for a year. 

Bread that is very stale may be made quite fresh for 
an hour or two by dipping it quickly into milk or water, 
and putting it in a brisk oven till quite liot through. It 
must be eaten at once, or it will be as stale as ever when 
cold. 

Meat to be kept in warm weather should be rubbed over 
with salad oil, every crevice filled with ginger ; meat that 
is for roasting or frying is much better preserved in this 
way than with salt ; take care that every part of the sur- 
face has a coat of oil. Steaks or chops cut off, which 
always keep badly, should be dipped into warm butter or 
even dripping, if oil is not handy (the object being to 
exclude the air), and then hung up till wanted. 

Mutton in cold weather should be hung four or five 
weeks in a place not subject to changes of temperature, 
and before it is so hung, every crevice filled with ginger 



A Few Things it is Well to Remember, 107 

and thoroughly dredged with flour, which must be then 
rubbed in with the hand till the surface is quite dry. 
This is the English fashion of keeping yenison. 

It may be useful for those who burn kerosene to know 
that when their lamps smell, give a bad light, and smoke, 
it is not necessary to buy new burners. Put the old 
ones in an old saucepan with water and a tablespoonful 
of soda, let them boil half an hour, wipe them, and 
your trouble will be over. 

Meat that has become slightly tainted may be quite 
restored by washing it in water in which is a teaspoonful 
of borax, cutting away every part in the least discolored. 

In summer when meat comes from the butcher's, if it 
is not going to be used the same day, it should be washed 
over with vinegar. 

• Poultry in summer should always have a piece of 
charcoal tied in a rag placed in the stomach, to be re- 
moved before cooking. Pieces of charcoal should also 
be put in the refrigerator and changed often. 

Oyster shells put one at a time in a stove that is 
''clinkered" will clean the bricks entirely. They 
should be put in when the fire is burning brightly. 

Salt and soapstone powder (to be bought at the drug- 
gist's) mend fire brick ; use equal quantities, make into a 
paste with water, and cement the brick ; they will be as 
strong as new ones. 

Ink spilled on carpets may be entirely removed by 
rubbing while wet with blotting paper, using fresh as 
it soils. 



CHAPTER XVI. 

OK SOME TABLE PEEJUDICES. 

Mai?"y people have strong prejudices against certain 
things which they have^never even tasted, or which they 
do frequently take and like as a part of something else, 
without knowing it. How common it is to hear and 
see untrayeled people declare that they dislike garlic, 
and could not touch anything with it in. Yet those 
very people will take Worcestershire sauce, in which gar- 
lic is actually predominant, with everything they eat ; 
and think none but English pickles eatable, which 
owe much of their excellence to the introduction of a 
soup<;on of garlic. Therefore I beg 'those who actually 
only know garlic from hearsay abuse of it, or from its 
presence on the breath of some inveterate garlic eater, 
to give it a fair trial when it appears in a recipe. It is 
just one of those things that require the most delicate 
handling, for which the French term a " sus2ncio7i " is 
most appreciated ; it should only be a suspicion, its 
presence should never be pronounced. As Blot once 
begged his readers, " Give garlic a fair trial in a remo- 
lade sauce." (Montpellier butter beaten into mayonnaise 
is a good remolade for cold meat or fish.) 

Curry is one of those things against which many are 
strongly prejudiced, and I am. inclined to think it is 

108 



On Some Table Prejudices, 109 

quite an acquired taste, but a taste which is an envi- 
able one to its possessors ; for them there is endless 
variety in all they eat. The capabilities of curry are 
very little known in this country, and, as the taste for 
it is so limited, I will not do more in its defense than 
indicate a pleasant use to which it may be put, and in 
which form it would be a welcome condiment to many 
to whom **a curry," pure and simple, would be obnox- 
ious. I once knew an Anglo-Indian who used curry as 
most people use cayenne ; it was put in a pepper-box, 
and with it he would at times pepper his fish or kidneys, 
even his eggs. Used in this way, it imparts a delightful 
piquancy to food, and is neither hot nor " spicy." 

Few people are so prejudiced as the English generally, 
and the stay-at-home Americans ; but the latter are to 
be taught by travel, the Englishman rarely. 

The average Briton leaves his island shores with the 
conviction that he will get nothing fit to eat till he gets 
back, and that he will have to be uncommonly careful 
once across the channel, or he will be having fricasseed 
frogs palmed on him for chicken. Poor man! in his 
horror of frogs, he does not know that the Paris res- 
taurateur who should give the costly frog for chicken, 
would soon end in the bankruptcy court. 

" If I could only get a decent dinner, a good roast 
and plain potato, I would like Paris much better," said 
an old Englishman to me once in that gay city. 

**But surely you can." 

"No ; I have been to restaurants of every class, and 
called for beefsteak and roast beef, but have never got 
the real article, although it's my belief," said he, lean- 
ing forward solemnly, "that I have eaten liorse three 
times this week." Of course the Englishman of rank. 



no Culture and Cooking, 

who has spent half his life on the continent, is not at all 
the average Englishman. 

Americans think the hare and rabbits, of which the 
English make such good use, very mean food indeed, 
and if they are unprejudiced enough to try them, from 
the fact that they are never well cooked, they dislike 
them, which prejudice the English reciprocate by look- 
ing on squirrels as being as little fit for food as a rat. 
And a familiar instance of prejudice from ignorance 
carried even to insanity, is that of the Irish in 1848, 
starving rather than eat the "yaller male," sent them 
by generous American sympathizers ; yet they come here 
and soon get over that dislike. Not so the French, who 
look on oatmeal and Indian meal as most unwholesome 
food. '^ (7« pese sur Vestomac, p« creuse Vestomac," I 
heard an old Frenchwoman say, trying to dissuade a 
mother from giving her children mush. 

The moral of all of which is, that for our comfort's 
sake, and the general good we should avoid unreason- 
able prejudices against unfamiliar food. We of course 
have a right to our honest dislikes ; but to condemn 
things because we have heard them despised, is pre- 
judice. 



CHAPTER XVIL 

A CHAPTER OF ODDS AN^D EKDS — VALEDICTORY.^ 

I HAVE alluded, in an earlier chapter, to the fact that 
many inexperienced cooks are afraid of altering recipes ; 
a few words on this subject may not be out of place. As 
a rule, a recipe should be faithfully followed in all im- 
portant points ; for instance, in making soup you can- 
not, because you are short of the given quantity of meat, 
put the same amount of water as directed for the full 
quantity, without damaging your soup ; but you may eas- 
ily reduce water and every other ingredient in the same 
proportion ; and, in mere matters of flavoring, you may 
vary to suit circumstances. If you are told to use cloves, 
and have none, a bit of mace may be substituted. 

If you read a recipe, and it calls for something you 
have not, consider whether that something has anything 
to do with the substance of the dish, or whether it is 
merely an accessory for which something else can be 
substituted. For instance, if you are ordered to use 
cream in a sauce, milk with a larger amount of well- 
washed butter may take its place ; but if you are told to 
use cream for charlotte russe or trifles, there is no way in 
which you could make milk serve, since it is not an 
accessory but the chief part of those dishes. For a 
cake in which cream is used, butter whipped to a cream 
may take its place. "Wine is usually optional in savory 
dishes ; it gives richness only. 

Ill 



112 Culture and Cooking. 

Again, in cakes be very careful the exact proportions 
of flour, eggs, and milk are observed ; of butter you can 
generally use more or less, haying a more or less rich 
cake in proportion. In any but plain cup cakes (which 
greatly depend on soda and acid for their lightness) 
never lessen the allowance of eggs ; never add milk if a 
cake is too stiff (but an extra Qgg may always be used), 
unless milk is ordered in the recipe, when more or less 
may be used as needed. Flavoring may be always varied. 

In reducing a recipe always reduce every ingredient, 
and it can make no difference in the results. Some- 
times, in cookery books, you are told to use articles not 
frequently found in ordinary kitchens ; for instance, a 
larding-needle (although that can be bought for twenty- 
five cents at any house-furnishing store, and should al- 
ways be in a kitchen) ; but, in case you have not one for 
meat, you may manage by making small cuts and insert- 
ing slips of bacon. 

Another article that is very useful, but seldom, if ever, 
to be found in small kitchens, is a salamander ; but when 
you wish to brown the top of a dish, and putting it in 
the oven would not do, or the oven is not quick enough 
to serve, an iron shovel, made nearly red, and a few red 
cinders in it, is a very good salamander. It must be 
held over the ai:;ticle that requires browning near enough 
to color it, yet not to burn. 

In the recipes I have given nothing is required that 
cannot be obtained, with more or less ease, in New York. 
For syrups, fruit Juices, etc., apply to your druggist ; if 
he has not them he will tell you where to obtain them. 
We often make up our minds that because a thing is not 
commonly used in this country, it is impossible to get it. 
Really there are very few things not to be got in New 



Chapter of Odds and Ends— Valedictory, 113 

York City to the intelligent seeker. You need an arti- 
cle of French or Italian or may be English grocery, that 
your grocer, a first-class one, perhaps, has not, and you 
make up your mind you cannot get it. But go into the 
quarters where French people live, and you can get 
eyerything belonging to the French cuisine. So preju- 
diced are the French in favor of the productions of la 
Mle France, that they do not believe in our parsley or 
our chives or garlic or shallots ; for I know at least one 
French grocer who imports them for his customers. On 
being asked why he brought them from France to a 
country where those very things were plentiful, he an- 
swered : 

"Oh, French herbs are much finer." 

Needless to say tarragon is one of the herbs so import- 
ed, and can thus be bought ; but, as several New Jersey 
truck gardeners grow all kinds of French herbs, they can 
be got in Washington Market, and most druggists keep 
them dried ; but for salads, Montpellier butter, and some 
other uses, the dried herb would not do, although for 
flavoring it would serve ; but the far better way is to 
grow them for yourself, as I have done. Any large 
seedsman will supply you with burnet, tarragon, and 
borage (very useful for salads, punch, etc.) seeds, and if 
you live in the country, have an herb bed ; if in town, 
there are few houses where there is not ground enough 
to serve for the purpose ; but even in these few houses 
one can have a box of earth in the kitchen window, in 
which your seeds will flourish. 

Parsley is a thing in almost daily request in winter, 

yet it is very expensive to buy it constantly for the sake 

of using the small spray that often suffices. It is a good 

plan, therefore, in fall, to get a few roots, plant them in 

8 



114 Culture and Cooking, 

a pot or box, and they will flourish all winter, if kept 
where they will not freeze, and be ready for garnishing 
at any minute. 

Always, as far as your means allow, have every con- 
venience for cooking. By having utensils proper for 
every purpose you save a great deal of work and much 
vexation of spirit. Yet it should be no excuse for bad 
work that such utensils are not at hand. A willing and 
intelligent cook will make the best of what she has. 
Apropos of this very thing Gouffe relates that a friend 
of his, an "artist" of renown, was sent for to the 
chateau of a Baron Argenteuil, who had taken a large 
company with him, unexpectedly crowding the chateau 
in every part. He, was shown into a dark passage in 
which a plank was suspended from the ceiling, and told 
this was to be his kitchen. He had to fashion his own 
utensils, for there was nothing provided, and his pastry 
he had to bake in a frying-pan — besides building two 
monumental plats on that board — and prepare a cold en- 
tree. But he cheerfully set to work to overcome diffi- 
culties, achieved his task, and was rewarded by the plau- 
dits of the diners. Such difficulties as these our servants 
nevei' have to encounter, and a cheerful endeavor to 
make the best of everything should be the rule. Yet, 
let us spare them all the labor we can, or rather make it 
as easy and pleasant as possible ; they will be more 
proud of their well-furnished kitchen, more cheerful in 
it, than they will of one where everything for their con- 
venience is grudged, and such pride and cheerfulness 
will be your gain. 

There is always a great deal of talk about servants in 
America, how bad and inefficient they are, how badly 
they contrast with those of England. Certainly, they 



Chapter of Odds and^ Ends— Valedictory. 115 

are not so efficient as those of the older country ; how 
could they be ? There, girls who are intended for servants 
have ever held before their eyes what they may or may 
not do in the future calling, and how it is to be done. 
But take one of these orderly, efficient girls, put her in 
an American family as general servant or as cook, where 
two are kept, washing and ironing to do, and a variety 
of other work, and see how your English servant would 
stare at your requirements. She has been accustomed to 
her own line of work at home ; if housemaid, she has 
been dressed for the day at noon ; if cook, she has never 
done even her own washing. 

She may, and will no doubt, fall into the way of the 
country, after a while, and on account of her early habits 
of respect, will make a good servant perhaps. But many 
of them would be quite indignant at being asked to do 
the average servant's work here. I am speaking now of 
the trained servants ; but, comparing the London *' maid- 
of-all-work" or '' slavey " with our own general servants, 
and considering how much more is expected of the latter, 
the comparison seems to me vastly in the favor of our own 
Bridgets. We may rest assured, however smoothly the 
wheels of household management glide along in wealthy 
families across the water, people who can only keep one 
or two have all our troubles with servants and a few 
added, and their faults are just as general a subject of 
conversation among ladies. 

France (out of Paris, from Parisian servants deliver 
me ! ) and Germany seem the favored lands where one 
servant does the work of three or four. Yet even they, 
are, they say, degenerating. Let us, then, be contented 
and make the best of what we have, assured that even 
Biddy is not so hopeless as she is painted. Kindness 



Ii6 Culture and Cooking. 

(not weakness), firmness, and patience work wonders, 
even with the roughest Emerald that ever crossed the 
sea. 

I have said somewhere else that you must beware of at- 
tempting too much at once ; perfect yourself in one thing 
before you attempt another. Take breaded chops or 
fried oysters, make opportunities for having them rather 
often, and do not rest satisfied until you have them as 
well fried as you have ever seen them anywhere ; " prac- 
tice makes perfect," and you certainly will achieve per- 
fection if you are not discouraged by one failure. But 
above all things never make experiments for company ; 
let them be made when it really matters little whether 
you succeed or not, and let your experiments be on a 
small scale ; don't attempt to fry a large dish of oysters 
or chops until it is a very easy task, or make more than 
half a pound of puff paste at first ; for if you fail with a 
large task before you, you will be tired and disheartened, 
hate the sight of what you are doing, and, as a conse- 
quence, not be likely to return to it very soon. The same 
may be said of cooks ; some of them are very fond of ex- 
periments, which taste I should always encourage ; but do 
not let them jump from one experiment to the other ; 
if they try a dish and fail, they often make up their 
minds that the fault is not theirs, that it is not worth 
while to " bother " with it. Here your knowledge will be 
of service ; you will show them that it can be done, how 
it should be done, and order the dish cook failed in, fre- 
quently, giving it sufficient surveillance to prevent your 
family suffering from her inexperience ; for, as a witty 
Frenchman said of Mme. du Deffaud's cook, *' Between 
her and Brinvilliers there is only the difference of in- 
tention."

But it is a fact that good living — by this I do not 
mean extravagant living — presupposes good breeding. 
Well-bred people sometimes live badly ; but ill-bred 
people seldom or ever live well, in the right sense of 
the term. 

Now, by way of valedictory, let me repeat that I do 
not think a lady's best or proper place is the kitchen ; 
but it is quite possible to have a perfectly served table, 
yet spend very little time there. Only that one little 
hour a day that Talleyrand, the busy man full of intrigue 
and statecraft, found time to spend with his cook, would 
insure your table being well served. For, after devoting 
say a few winter months to perfecting yourself in a few 
things, you will be able to teach your cook, who is often 
ambitious to excel if put in the right way. A word here 
about cooks. 

The knowledge that if they fail to do a thing well 
you will do it yourself, will often put them on their 
mettle to do their best ; while the feeling that you don't 
know, will make them careless. 



Ii8 Culture and Cooking. 

Servants have a great deal more amour propre than 
people imagine ; therefore, stimulate it by judicious 
praise and appreciation ; let them think that to send in a 
dish perfect, is a glory to themselves as well as a pleasure 
to you. While careful to remark when alone with them 
upon any fault that results from carelessness, be equally 
careful to give all the praise you can, and repeat to 
them complimentary remarks that may have been made 
on their skill. Servants are usually — such is the weak- 
ness of feminine nature, whether in the drawing-room 
or the kitchen — very sensitive to the praise or blame of 
the gentlemen of the family. Indulge poor humanity a 
little when you honestly can.

PREFACE, 



This is not a cookery book. It makes no attempt to 
replace a good one ; it is rather an effort to fill up the 
gap between you and your household oracle, whether 
she be one of those exasperating old friends who mad- 
dened our mother with their yagueness, or the newer 
and better lights of our own generation, the latest and 
best of all being a lady as well known for her novels as 
for her works on domestic economy — one more proof, if 
proof were needed, of the truth I endearor to set forth 
— if somewhat tediously forgive me — in this little book : 
that cooking and cultivation are by no means antagonis- 
tic. Who does not remember with affectionate admira- 
tion Charlotte Bronte taking the eyes out of the pota- 
toes stealthily, for fear of hurting the feelings of her 
purblind old servant ; or Margaret Fuller shelling peas ? 

The chief difficulty, I fancy, with women trying 
recipes is, that they fail and know not why they fail, 
and so become discouraged, and this is where I hope 
to step in. But although this is not a cookery book, 
insomuch as it does not deal chiefly with recipes, I shall 
yet give a few ; but only when they are, or I believe 



iv Preface. 

them to be, better than those in general use, or good 
things little known, or supposed to belong to the do- 
main of a French chef, of which I have introduced a 
good many. Should I succeed in making things that 
were obscure before clear to a few women, I shall be as 
proud as was Mme. de Genlis when she boasts in her 
Memoirs that she has taught six new dishes to a Ger- 
man housewife. Six new dishes ! When Brillat-Sava- 
rin says : " He who has invented one new dish has 
done more for the pleasure of mankind than he who has 
discoTered a star."

CULTUEE AND CoOKING. 



CHAPTER I. 



A FEW PRELIMINABY KEMABKS. 

Alexandre Dumas, pere, after writing five hundred 
novels, says, " I wish to close my literary career with a 
book on cooking." 

And in the hundred pages or so of preface — or perhaps 
overture would be the better word, since in it a group 
of literary men, while contributing recondite recipes, 
flourish trumpets in every key — to his huge volume he 
says, "I wish to be read by people of the world, and 
practiced by people of the art " (gens de Vart) ; and al- 
though / wish, like every one who writes, to be read by 
all the world, I wish to aid the practice, not of the pro- 
fessors of the culinary art, but those whose aspirations 
point to an enjoyment of the good things of life, but 
whose means of attaining them are limited. 

There is a great deal of talk just now about cooking ; 
in a lesser degree it takes its place as a popular topic 
with ceramics, modern antiques, and household art. The 
fact of it being in a mild way fashionable may do a lit- 
tle good to the eating world in general. And it may 
make it more easy to convince young women of refined 
1 1 



2 Culture and Cooking. 

proclivities that the art of cooking is not beneath their 
attention, to know that the Queen of England's daugh- 
ters—and of course the cream of the London fair — have 
attended the lectures on the subject delivered at South 
Kensington, and that a young lady of rank, Sir James 
Coles's daughter, has been recording angel to the asso- 
ciation, is in fact the R. C. 0. who edits the "Ofiacial 
Handbook of Cookery." 

But, notwithstanding all that has been done by South 
Kensington lectures in London and Miss Corson's Cook- 
ing School in !N"ew York to popularize the culinary art, 
one may go into a dozen houses, and find the ladies of 
the family with sticky fingers, scissors, and gum pot, 
busily porcelainizing clay jars, and not find one where 
they are as zealously trying to work out the problems of 
the "Official Handbook of Cookery." 

I have nothing to say against the artistic distractions 
of the day. Anything that will induce love of the beau- 
tiful, and remove from us the possibility of a return to 
the horrors of hair-cloth andbrocatel and crochet tidies, 
Avill be a stride in the right direction. But what I do 
protest against, is the fact, that the same refined girls 
and matrons, who so love to adorn their houses that they 
will spend hours improving a pickle jar, mediaevalizing 
their furniture, or decorating the dinner service, will 
shirk everything that pertains to the preparation of food 
as dirty, disagreeable drudgery, and sit down to a com- 
monplace, ill-prepared meal, served on those artistic 
plates, as complacently as if dainty food were not a re- 
finement ; as if heavy rolls and poor bread, burnt or 
greasy steak, and wilted potatoes did not smack of the 
shanty, just as loudly as coarse crockery or rag carpet — 
indeed far more so ; the carpet and crockery may be due 



A Few Preliminary Remarks. 3 

to poverty, but a dainty meal or its reverse will speak 
volumes for innate refinement or its lack in the woman 
who serves it. You see by my speaking of rag carpets 
and dainty meals in one breath, that I do not consider 
good things to be the privilege of the rich alone. 

There are a great many dainty things the household 
of small or moderate means can have just as easily as 
the most wealthy. Beautiful bread — light, white, crisp 
— costs no more than the tough, thick-crusted boulder, 
with cavities like eye-sockets, that one so frequently 
meets with as home-made bread. As Hood says: 

" Who has not met with home-made bread, 
A heavy compound of putty and lead ?" 

Delicious cofiEee is only a matter of care, not expense — 
and indeed in America the cause of poor food, even in a 
boarding-house, is seldom in the quality of the articles 
BO much as in the preparation and selection of them — 
yet an epicure can breakfast well with fine bread and 
butter and good coffee. And this leads me to another 
thing : many people think that to give too much atten- 
tion to food shows gluttony. I have heard a lady say 
with a tone of -virtuous rebuke, when the conversation 
turned from fashions to cooking, " I give very little time 
to cooking, we eat to live only " — which is exactly what 
an animal does. Eating to live is mere feeding. Brillat- 
Savarin, an abstemious eater himself, among other witty 
things on the same topic says, " L' animal se repait, 
Vhomme m.ange, Vhomme d' esprit seul sait manger." 

Nine people out of ten, when they call a man an 
epicure, mean it as a sort of reproach, a man who is 
averse to every-day food, one whom plain fare would 
fail to satisfy ; but Grimod de la Reyniere, the most eel- 



4 Culture and Cooking. 

ebrated gourmet of his day, author of "Almanack des 
Gourmands, " and authority on all matters culinary of the 
last century, said, "A true epicure can dine well on one 
dish, provided it is excellent of its kind." Excellent, 
that is it. A little care will generally secure to us the 
refinement of having only on the table what is excellent 
of its kind. If it is but potatoes and salt, let the salt be 
ground fine, and the potatoes white and mealy. Thack- 
eray says, an epicure is one who never tires of brown 
bread and fresh butter, and in this sense every New 
Yorker who has his rolls from the Brevoort House, and 
uses Darlington butter, is an epicure. There seems to 
me, more mere animalism in wading through a long 
bill of fare, eating three or four indifferently cooked 
vegetables, fish, meat, poultry, each second-rate in qual- 
ity, or made so by bad cooking, and declaring that you 
have dined well, and are easy to please, than there is in 
taking pains to have a perfectly broiled chop, a fine po- 
tato, and a salad, on which any true epicure could dine 
well, while on the former fare he would leave the table 
hungry. 

Spenser points a moral for me when he says, speaking 
of the Irish in 1580, " That wherever they found a plot 
of shamrocks or water-cresses they had a feast ;" but there 
were gourmets even among them, for "some gobbled 
the green food as it came, and some picked the faultless 
stalks, and looked for the bloom on the leaf." 
■ Thus it is, when I speak of ''good living," I do not 
mean expensive living or high living, but living so that 
the table may be as elegant as the dishes on which it is 
served. 

I believe there exists a feeling, not often expressed per- 
haps, but prevalent among young people, that for a lady 



A Few Preliminary Remarks. 5 

to cook with her own hands is vulgar; to love to do it 
shows that she is of low intellectual caliber, a sort of 
drawing-room Bridget. When or how this idea arose it 
would be difficult to say, for in the middle ages cooks 
were often noble ; a Montmorency was chef de cuisine to 
Philip of Valois ; Montesquieu descended, and was not 
ashamed of his descent, from the second cook of the 
Connetable de Bourbon, who ennobled him. And from 
Lord Bacon, "brightest, greatest, meanest of mankind," 
who took, it is said, great interest in cooking, to Talley- 
rand, the Machiayelli of France, who spent an hour every 
day with his cook, we find great men delighting in the 
art as a recreation. 

It is surprising that such an essentially artistic people 
as Americans should so neglect an art which a great 
French writer calls the " science mignonne of all dis- 
tinguished men of the world." Napoleon the Great so 
fully recognized the social value of keeping a good table 
that, although no gourmet himself, he wished all his 
chief functionaries to be so. "Keep a good table," he 
told them; "if you get into debt for it I will pay." 
And later, one of his most devoted adherents, the Mar- 
quis de Cussy, out of favor with Louis XVIII. on 
account of that very devotion, found his reputation as 
a gourmet very serviceable to him. A friend applied 
for a place at court for him, which Louis refused, till he 
heard that M. de Cussy had invented the mixture of 
cream, strawberries, and champagne, when he granted 
the petition at once. Nor is this a solitary instance in 
history where culinary skill has been a passport to for- 
tune to its possessor. Savarin relates that the Cheva- 
lier d'Aubigny, exiled from France, was in London, in 
utter poverty, notwithstanding which, by chance, he was 



6 Culture and Cooking. 

invited to dine at a taTern frequented by the young bucks 
of that day. 

After he had finished his dinner, a party of young 
gentlemen, who had been observing him from their table, 
sent one of their number with many apologies and ex- 
cuses to beg of him, as a son of a nation renowned for 
their salads, to be kind enough to mix theirs for them. 
He complied, and while occupied in making the salad, 
told them frankly his story, and did not hide his pov- 
erty. One of the gentlemen, as they parted, slipped a 
five-pound note into his hand, and his need of it was so 
great that he did not obey the prompting of his pride, 
but accepted it. 

A few days later he was sent for to a great house, and 
learned on his arrival that the young gentleman he had 
obliged at the tavern had spoken so highly of his salad 
that they begged him to do the same thing again. A 
very handsome sum was tendered him on his departure, 
and afterwards he had frequent calls on his skill, until 
it became the fashion to have salads prepared by d'Au- 
bigny, who became a well-known character in London, 
and was called " the fashionalle salad-maher.'' In a few 
years he amassed a large fortune by this means, and 
was in such request that his carriage would drive from 
house to house, carrying him and his various condiments 
— for he took with him everything that could give 
variety to his concoctions — from one place, where his 
services were needed, to another. 

The contempt for this art of cooking is confined to this 
country, and to the lower middle classes in England. By 
the " lower middle classes" I mean, what Carlyle terms 
thegigocracy— ?.e., people sufBciently well-to-do to keep a 
gig or phaeton — well-to-do tradesmen, small professional

men, the class whose womenkincl would call themselves 
"genteel," and many absurd stories are told of the 
determined ignorance and pretense of these would-be 
ladies. But in no class above tliis is a knowledge of 
cooking a thing to be ashamed of ; in England, indeed, 
so far from that being the case, indifference to the sub- 
ject, or lack of understanding and taste for certain dishes 
is looked upon as a sort of proof of want of breeding. 
Not to like curry, macaroni, or parmesan, pdU de fois 
gras, mushrooms, and such like, is a sign that you have 
not been all your life accustomed to good living. Mr. 
Hardy, in his " Pair of Blue Eyes," cleverly hits this 
prejudice when he makes Mr. Swancourt say, " I knew 
the fellow wasn't a gentleman; he had no acquired tastes, 
never took Worcestershire sauce." 

Abroad many women of high rank and culture de- 
vote a good deal of time to a thorough understanding 
of the subject. We have a lady of the " lordly line of 
proud St. Clair " writing for us " Dainty Dishes," and 
doing it with a zest that shows she enjoys her work, 
although she does once in a while forget something she 
ought to have mentioned, and later still we have Miss 
Eose Coles writing the " Official Handbook of Cookery." 

But it is in graceful, refined Prance that cookery is 
and has been, a pet art. Any bill of fare or French 
cookery book will betray to a thoughtful reader the at- 
tention given to the subject by the wittiest, gayest, and 
most beautiful women, and the greatest men. The high- 
sounding names attached to French standard dishes are 
no mere caprice or homage of a French cook to the great in 
the land, but actually point out their inventor. Thus 
Bechamel' yrzs invented by the Marquis de Bechamel, as 
a sauce for codfish ; while Filets do Lapereau a la

Berry were inTented by the Duchess de Berry, daughter 
of the regent Orleans, who himself inTented Pain a la 
d' Orleans, while to Richelieu we are indebted for hun- 
dreds of dishes besides the renowned mayonnaise. 

Cailles a la Mirepois, Chartreuse a la Mauconseil, 
Poulets a la Villeroy, betray the tastes of the three great 
ladies whose name they bear. 

But not in courts alone has the art had its devotees. 
Almost every great name in French literature brings to 
mind something its owner said or did about cooking. 
Dumas, who was a prince of cooks, and of whom it is 
related that in 1860, when living at Varennes, St. Maur, 
dividing his time, as usual, between cooking and litera- 
ture {Lorsqu'il ne faisait pas sauter un roman, il 
faisait sauter des petits oignons), on Mountjoye, a 
young artist friend and neighbor, going to see him, he 
cooked dinner for him. Going into the poultry yard, 
after donning a white apron, he wrung the neck of a 
chicken; then to the kitchen garden for vegetables, 
which he peeled and washed himself ; lit the i3re, got 
butter and flour ready, put on his saucepans, then cooked, 
stirred, tasted, seasoned until dinner time. Then he 
entered in triumph and announced, " Le diner est 
servi." For six months he passed three or four days a 
week cooking for Mountjoye. This novelist's book says, 
in connection with the fact that great cooks in France 
have been men of literary culture, and literary men often 
fine cooks, " It is not surprising that literary men have 
always formed the entourage of a great chef, for, to 
appreciate thoroughly all there is in the culinary art, 
none are so well able as men of letters; accustomed as 
they are to all refinements, they can appreciate better 
than others those of the table," thus paying himself and

confreres a delicate little compliment at the expense of 
the non-literary world; but, notwithstanding the naive 
self-glorification, he states a fact that helps to point my 
moral, that indifference to cooking does not indicate re- 
finement, intellect, or social pre-eminence. 

Brillat-Savarin, grave judge as he was, land abstemi- 
ous eater, yet has written the book of books on the art 
of eating. It was he who said, " Tell me what you eat, 
I will tell you what you are," as pregnant with truth as 
the better-known proverb it paraphrases. 

Malherbe loved to watch his cook at work. I think it 
was he who said, " A coarse-minded man could never be 
a cook," and Charles Baudelaire, the Poe of France, takes 
a poet's view of our daily wants, when he says, " that an 
ideal cook must have a great deal of the poet's nature, 
combining something of the voluptuary with the man 
of science learned in the chemical principles of matter;" 
although he goes further than we care to follow when 
he says, that the question of sauces and seasoning re- 
quires "a chapter as grave as &feuilleton de science." 

It has been said by foreigners that Americans care 
nothing for the refinements of the table, but I think 
they do care. I have known many a woman in com- 
fortable circumstances long to have a good table, many 
a man aspire to better things, and if he could only get 
them at home would pay any money. But the getting 
them at home is the difficulty ; on a table covered with 
exquisite linen, glass, and silver, whose presiding queen 
is more likely than not a type of the American lady — 
graceful, refined, and witty— on such a table, with such 
surroundings, will come the plentiful, coarse, common- 
place dinner. 

The chief reason for this is lack of knowledge on the

part of our ladies: know how to do a thing yourself, and 
you will get it well done by others. But how are many 
of them to know ? The daughters of the wealthy in 
this country often marry struggling men, and they know 
less about domestic economy than ladies of the higher 
ranks abroad; not because English or French ladies take 
more part in housekeeping, but because they are at home 
all their lives. Ladies of the highest rank never go to a 
boarding or any other school, and these are the women 
who, with some few exceptions, know best how things 
should be done. They are at home listening to criti- 
cisms from papa, who is an epicure perhaps,, on the 
shortcomings of his own table, or his neighbors'; from 
mamma, as to what the soup lacks, why cook is not a 
"cordon lieu" etc., while our girls are at school, far 
away from domestic comments, deep in the agonies of 
algebra perhaps ; and directly they leave school, in many 
cases they marry. As a preparation for the state of 
matrimony most of them learn how to make cake and 
preserves, and the very excellence of their attainments 
in that way proves how easy it would be for them, with 
their dainty fingers and good taste, to far excel their Eu- 
ropean cousins in that art which a French writer says is 
based on "reason, health, common sense, and sound taste." 
Here let me say, I do not by any means advocate a 
woman, who can afford to pay a first-rate cook, avoiding 
the expense by cooking herself ; on the contrary, I think 
no woman is justified in doing work herself that she has 
the means given her to get done by employing others. 
I have no praise for the economical woman, who, from 
a desire to save, does her own work without necessity for 
economy. It is not her work; the moment slie can afford 
to employ others it is the work of some less fortunate per-

son. But in this country, it often happens that a good 
cook is not to be found for money, although the raw ma- 
terial of which one might be made is much oftener at 
hand. And if ladies would only practice the culinary art 
with as much, nay, half as much assiduity as they give to 
a new pattern in crochet ; devote as much time to attain- 
ing perfection in one dish or article of food, be it per- 
fect bread, or some French dish which father, brother, 
or husband goes to Delmonico's to enjoy, as they do to 
the crochet tidies or embroidered rugs with which they 
decorate their drawing-rooms, they could then take the 
material, in the shape of any ambitious girl they may 
meet with, and make her a fine cook. In the time they 
take to make a dozen tidies, they would have a dozen 
dishes at their fingers' ends; and let me tell you, the 
woman who can cook a dozen things, outside of pre- 
serves, in a perfect manner is a rarity here, and a good 
cook anywhere, for, by the time the dozen are accom- 
plished, she will have learned so much of the art of cook- 
ing that all else will come easy. One good soup, bouil- 
lon, and you have the foundation of all others ; two 
good sauces, white sauce and brown, "les sauces meres " 
as the French call them (mothers of all other sauces), 
and all others are matters of detail. Learn to make one 
kind of roll perfectly, as light, plump, and crisp as 
Delmonico's, and all varieties are at your fingers' ends; 
you dan have kringles, Vienna rolls, Kreuznach horns, 
Yorkshire tea cakes, English Sally Lunns and Bath 
buns ; all are then as easy to make as common soda bis- 
cuit. In fact, in cooking, as in many other things, " ce 
finest que le premier pas que coute; '' failures are almost 
certain at the beginning, but a failure is often a step 
toward success — if we only know the reason of the failure. 



CHAPTEK II. 

ON BEEAD. 

Of all articles of food, bread is perhaps the one about 
which most has been written, most instruction given, 
and most failures made. Yet what adds more to the 
elegance of a table than exquisite bread or breads, and 
— unless you lire in a large city and depend on the baker 
— what so rare ? A lady who is very proud of her table, 
and justly so, said to me quite lately, " I cannot under- 
stand how it is we never have really fine home-made 
bread. I have tried many recipes, following them 
closely, and I can't achieve anything but a common- 
place loaf with a thick, hard crust ; and as for rolls, 
they are my despair. I have wasted eggs, butter, and 
patience so often that I have determined to give them 
up, but a fine loaf I will try for." 

" And when you achieve the fine loaf, you may revel 
in home-made rolls," I answered. 

And so I advise every one first to make perfect bread, 
light, white, crisp, and thin-crusted, that rarest thing 
in home-made bread. 

I have read over many recipes for bread, and am con- 
vinced that when the time allowed for rising is specified, 
it is invariably too short. One standard book directs 
you to leave your sponge two hours, and the bread when 
made up a quarter of an hour. This recipe strictly 
followed must result in heavy, tough bread. As bread 

12 



On Bread. 13 

is so important, and so many fail, I will give my own 
method from beginning to end ; not that there are not 
numberless good recipes, but simply because they fre- 
quently need adapting to circumstances, and altering a 
recipe is one of the things a tyro fears to do. 

I make a sponge over night, using a dried yeast-cake 
soaked in a pint of warm water, to which I add a spoon- 
ful of salt, and, if the weather is warm, as much soda as 
will lie on a dime ; make this into a stifE batter with 
flour — it may take a quart or less, flour yaries so much, 
to giye a rule is impossible ; but if, after standing, the 
sponge has a watery appearance, make it thicker by 
sprinkling in more flour, beat hard a few miniates, and 
coyer with a cloth — in winter keep a piece of thick flan- 
nel for the purpose, as a chill is fatal to your sponge— 
and set in a warm place free from draughts. 

The next morning, when the sponge is quite light- 
that is to say, at least twice the bulk it was, and like a 
honeycomb — take two quarts of flour, more or less, as 
you require, but I recommend at first a small baking, 
and this will make three small loaves ; in winter, flour 
should be dried and warmed ; put it in your mixing 
bowl, and turn the sponge into a hole in the center. 
Have ready some water, rather more than lukewarm, but 
not Tiot. Add it gradually, stirring your flour into the 
sponge at the same time. The great fault in making 
bread is getting the dough too stiff ; it should be as soft 
as possible, without being at all sticky or wet. Now 
knead it with both hands from all sides into the center ; 
keep this motion, occasionally dipping your hands into 
the flour if the dough sticks, but do not add more flour 
unless the paste sticks very much ; if you have the right 
consistency it will be a smooth mass, very soft to the 



14 Culture and Cooking. 

touch, yet not sticky, but this may not be attained at a 
first mixing without adding flour by degrees. When 
you have kneaded the dough until it leaves the bowl all 
round, set it in a warm place to rise. "When it is well 
risen, feels very soft and warm to the touch, and is twice its 
bulk, knead it once more thoroughly, then put it in tins 
either floured, and the flour not adhering shaken out, or 
buttered, putting in each a piece of dough half the size 
you intend your loaf to be. Now everything depends on 
your oven. Many people bake their bread slowly, leav- 
ing it in the oven a long time, and this causes a thick, 
hard crust. When baked in the modern iron oven, 
quick baking is necessary. Let the oven be quite hot, 
then put a little ball of paste in, and if it browns palely 
in seven to ten minutes it is about right ; if it burns, it 
is too hot ; open the damper ten minutes. Your bread, 
after it is in the tins, will rise much more quickly than 
the first time. Let it get light, but not too light — twice 
its inlk is a good rule ; but if it is light before your oven 
is ready, and thus in danger of getting too porous, work 
it down with your hand, it will not harm it, although it 
is better so to manage that the oven waits for the bread 
rather than the bread for the oven. A small loaf^and 
by all means make them small until you have gained 
experience — will not take more than three qu-arters of an 
hour to bake ; when a nice yellow brown, take it out, turn 
it out of the tin into a cloth, and tap the bottom ; if it is 
crisp and smells cooked, the loaf is done. Once the bot- 
tom is brown it need remain no longer. Should that, 
however, from fault of your oven, be not brown, but 
soft and white, you must put it back in the oven, the 
bottom upwards. An oven that does not bake at the 
bottom will, however, be likely to spoil your bread. It 



On Bread. 15 

is sometimes caused by a careless servant leaving a col- 
lection of ashes underneath it ; satisfy yourself that all 
the flues are perfectly clean and clear before beginning 
to bake, and if it still refuses to do its duty, change it, 
for you will have nothing but loss and vexation of spirit 
while you have it in use. I think you will fiud this 
bread white, evenly porous (not with small holes in one 
part and caverns in another ; if it is so you have made 
your dough too stiff, and it is not sufficiently kneaded), 
and with a thin, crisp crust. Bread will surely fail to 
rise at all if you have scalded the yeast ; the water must 
never be too hot. In winter, if it gets" chilled, it will 
only rise slowly, or not at all, and in using baker's or 
German yeast take care that it is not stale, which Avill 
cause heavy, irregular bread. 

In making bread with compressed yeast proceed in 
exactly the same way, excepting that the sponge will not 
need to be set over night, unless you want to bake very 
early. 

If you have once produced bread to your satisfaction 
you will find no difficulty in making rolls. Proceed as 
follows : 

Take a piece of the dough from your baking after it 
has risen once. To a piece as large as a man's fist take 
a large tablespoonful of butter and a little powdered 
sugar ; work them into the dough, put it in a bowl, cover 
it, and set it in a warm place to rise— a shelf behind the 
stove is best ; if you make this at the same time as 
your bread, you will find it takes longer to rise ; the 
butter causes that difference ; when very light, much 
lighter than your bread should be, take your hand and 
push it down till.it is not larger than when you put it 
in the bowl ; let it rise again, and again push it down. 



1 6 Culture and Cooking. 

but not so tliorougbly ; do this once or twice more, and 
you have the secret of light rolls. You will find them-rise 
Tery quickly, after once or twice pushing down. "When 
they have risen the third or fourth time, take a little 
butter on your hands, and break ofE small pieces about 
the size of a walnut and roll them round. Either put 
them on a tin close together, to be broken apart, or an 
inch or two from each other, in which case work in a 
little more flour, and cut a cleft on the top, and once more 
set to rise ; half an hour will be long enough generally, 
but in this case you must judge for yourself, they some- 
times take an hour ; if they look swelled very much and 
smooth they will be ready. Have a nice hot oven, and 
bake for twelve to fifteen minutes. 

Add a little more sugar to your dough and an egg, go 
through the same process, brush them over with sugar 
dissolved in milk, and you will have delicious rusks. 

The above is my own method of making rolls, and the 
simplest I know of ; but there are numbers of other 
recipes given in cookery books which would be just as 
good if the exact directions for letting them rise were 
given. As a test — and every experiment you try will be 
so much gained in your experience— follow the recipe 
given for rolls in any good cookery book, take part of 
the dough and let it rise as therein directed, and bake, 
set the other part to rise as / direct, and notice the dif- 
ference. 

Keeuzn-ach Hoens. — Either take a third of the 
dough made for bread with three quarts of flour, or set 
a sponge with a pint of flour and a yeast-cake soaked in 
half a pint of warm water or milk, making it into a stif- 
fish dough with another pint of flour; then add four 
ounces of butter, a little sugar, and two eggs; work well. 



On Bread. 17 

If you use the bread dough, you will need to dredge in 
a little more flour on account of the eggs, but not very 
much; then set to rise as for rolls, work it down twice or 
thrice, then turn the dough out on the molding board 
lightly floured, roll it as you would pie-crust into pieces 
sis inches square, and quarter of an inch thick, make two 
sharp, quick cuts across it from corner to corner, and you 
will have from each square four three-cornered pieces of 
paste; spread each thinly with soft butter, flour lightly, 
and roll up very lightly from the wide side, taking care 
that it is not squeezed together in any way ; lay them on 
a tin with the side on which the point comes uppermost, 
and bend round in the form of a horseshoe; these will 
take some time to rise; when they have swollen much 
and look light, brush them over with white of egg 
(not beaten) or milk and butter, and bake in a good 
oven. 

Kkingles are made from the same recipe, but with 
another egg and two ounces of sugar (powdered) added 
to the dough when first set to rise; then, when well risen 
two or three times, instead of rolling with a pin as for 
horns, break off pieces, roll between your hands as thick 
as your finger, and form into figure eights, rings, fingers; 
or take three strips, fiour and roll them as thick as your 
finger, tapering at each end ; lay them on the board, 
fasten the three together at one end, and then lay one 
over the other in a plait, fasten the other end, and set to 
rise, bake; when done, brush over with sugar dissolved in 
milk, and sprinkle with sugar. 

All these breads are delicious for breakfast, and may 
easily be had without excessive early rising if the sponge 
is set in the morning, dough made in the afternoon, 
and the rising and working done in the evening ; when. 



i8 Culture and Cooking. 

instead of making up into rolls, horns, or kringles, push 
the dougli down thoroughly, coyer with a damp folded 
cloth, and put in a very cold place if in summer — not on 
ice of course — then next morning, as soon as the fire is 
alight, mold, but do not push down any more, put in a 
Tery warm spot, and when light, bake. 

In summer, as I have said, I think it safest, to prevent 
danger of souring, to put a little soda in the sponge for 
bread ; and for rolls, or anything requiring to rise sev- 
eral times, it is an essential precaution. 

Bkioche. — I suppose the very name of this delectable 
French dainty will call up in the mind's eye of many 
who read this book that great " little" shop, Au Grand 
Brioche, on the Boulevards Poissoniere, where, on Sun- 
day afternoons, scores of boys from the Lycees form 
en queue with the general public, waiting the hour 
when the piles of golden brioche shall be ready to ex- 
change for their eager sous. But I venture to say, a 
really fine brioche is rarely eaten on this side the Atlan- 
tic. They being-a luxury welcome to all, and especially 
aromatic of Paris, I tried many times to make them, 
obtaining for that purpose recipes from French friends, 
and from standard French books, but never succeeded 
in producing the ideal brioche until I met with Gouf- 
fe's great book, the " Livre de Cuisine," after reading 
which, I may here say, all secrets of the French kitchen 
are laid bare ; no effort is spared to make everytliing 
plain, from the humble pot-au-feu to the most gorgeous 
monumental pled. And I would refer any one who wants 
to become proficient in any French dish, to that book, 
feeling sure that, in following strictly the directions, 
there will be no failure. It is the one book I have met 
with on the subject in which no margin is left for your

own tnowledge, if you hare it, to fill up. But to the 
brioche. 

PARIS JOCKET-CLUB KECIPB FOK BKIOCHB. 

Sift one pound of flour, take one fourth of it, and add 
rather more than half a cake of compressed yeast, dis- 
solved in half a gill of warm water, make into a sponge 
with a very little more water, put it in a warm place ; 
when it is double its volume take the rest of the flour, 
make a hole in the center, and put in it an equal quantity 
of salt and sugar, about a teaspoonful, and two tablespoon- 
fuls of water to dissolve them. Three quarters of a pound 
of butter and four eggs, beat well, then add another egg, 
beat again, and add another, and so on until seven have 
been used ; the paste must be soft, but not spread ; if too 
firm, add another egg. Now mix this paste with the 
sponge thoroughly, beating until the paste leaves the 
sides of the bowl, then put it in a crock and cover ; let 
it stand four hours in a warm place, then turn it out on 
a board, spread it and double it four times, return it to 
the crock, and let it rise again two hours ; repeat the 
former process of doubling and spreading, and put it in 
a very cold place for two hours, or until you want to use 
it. Mold in any form you like, but the true brioche is 
two pieces, one as large again as the other ; form the 
large one into a ball, make a deep depression in the cen- 
ter, on which place the smaller ball, pressing it gently 
in ; cut two or three gashes round it with a sharp knife, 
and bake a beautiful golden brown. These brioche are 
such a luxury, and so sure to come out right, that the 
trouble of making them is well worth the taking, and 
for another reason : every one knows the great difficulty 
of making puff paste in summer, and a short paste is

never handsome ; but take a piece of brioche paste, roll 
it out thin, dredge with flour, fold and roll again, then 
use as you would puflE paste ; if for sweet pastry, a 
little powdered sugar may be sprinkled through it in- 
stead of dredging with flour. This makes a very hand- 
some and delicious crust. Or, another use to which it 
may be put is to roll it out, cut it in rounds, lay on 
them mince-meat, orange marmalade, Jam, or merely 
sprinkle with currants, chopped citron, and spices, fold, 
pi-ess the edges, and bake. 

Before quitting the subject of breads I must introduce 
a novelty which I will call "soufflee bread." It is 
quickly made, possible even when the fire is poor, and so 
delicious that I know you will thank me for making 
you acquainted with it. 

Use two or three eggs according to size you wish, and 
to each egg a tablespoonful of flour. Mix the yolks 
with the flour and with them a dessert-spoonful of but- 
ter melted, and enough milk to make a very tliick batter, 
work, add a pinch of salt and a teaspoonful of sugar, 
work till quite smooth, then add the whites .of the eggs 
in a firm froth, stir them in gently, and add a quarter 
teaspoonful of soda and half a one of cream of tartar. 
Have ready an iron frying-pan (or an earthen one that 
will stand heat is better), made hot with a tablespoonful 
of butter in it, also hot, but not so hot as for frying. 
Pour the batter (which should be of the consistency of 
sponge cake batter) into the pan, cover it with a lid 
or tin plate, and set it back of the stove if the fire is 
hot — if very slow it may be forward ; when well risen 
and near done, put it in the oven, or if the oven 
is cold you may turn it gently, not to deaden it. 
Serve when done (try with a twig), the under side

uppermost ; it should be of a fine golden brown and 
look like an omelet. This soufflee bread is equally 
good hahed in a tin in which is rather more butter than 
enough to grease it ; the oven must be very hot in- 
deed. Cover it for the few minutes with a tin plate or 
lid, to prevent it scorching before it has risen ; when it 
has pufEed up remove the lid, and allow it to brown, ten 
to fifteen minutes should bake it ; turn it out as you 
would sponge cake — very carefully, not to deaden it. To 
succeed with bread you must use the very best flour. 



CHAPTER III. 

PASTKT. 

To MAKE good puff paste is a thing many ladies are 
anxious to do, and in which they generally fail, and this 
not so much because they do not make it properly, as 
because they handle it badly. A lady who was yery 
anxious to excel in pastry once asked me to allow her to 
watch me make paste. I did so, and explained that there 
was more in the manner of using than in the making 
up. I then gaye her a piece of my paste when com- 
pleted, and asked her to cover some patty pans while I 
covered others, cautioning her as to the way she must 
cover them ; yet, when those covered by her came out 
of the oven they had not risen at all, they were like rich 
short paste ; while my own, made from the same paste, 
were toppling over with lightness. I had, without say- 
ing anything, pressed my thumb slightly on one spot of 
one of mine ; in that spot the paste had not risen at all, 
and I think this practical demonstration of what I had 
tried to explain was more usefxil than an hour's talk 
would have been. 

I will first give my method of making, which is the 
usual French way of making "■ feuilletonage." Take 
one pound of butter, or half of it lard ; press all the 
water out by squeezing it in a cloth ; this is impor- 
tant, as the liquid in it would wet your paste ; take a 
third of the butter, or butter and lard, and rub it into 

23 



Pastry. 23 

one pound of fine flour ; add no salt if your butter is 
salted ; then take enough water (to which you may add 
the well-beaten white of an Qgg, but it is not absolutely 
necessary) to make the flour into a smooth, firm dough; it 
must not be too stiff, or it will be hard to roll out, or 
too soft, or it will neyer make good paste ; it should roll 
easily, yet not stick ; work it till it is very smooth, then 
roll it out till it is half an inch thick ; now lay the whole 
of the butter in the center, fold one-third the paste over, 
then the other third ; it is now folded in three, with the 
butter completely hidden ; now turn the ends toward 
you, and roll it till it is half an inch thick, taking care, 
by rolling very evenly, that the butter is not pressed out 
at the other end ; now you have a piece of paste about 
two feet long, and not half that width ; flour it lightly, 
and fold over one third and under one third, which will 
almost bring it to a square again ; turn it round so that 
what was the side is now the end, and roll. Most likely 
now the butter will begin to break tlirough, in which 
case fold it, after flouring lightly, in three, as before, and 
put it on a dish on the ice, covering it with a damp cloth. 
You may now either leave it for an hour or two, or till 
next day. Paste made the day before it is used is much 
better and easier to manage, and in winter it may be kept 
for four or five days in a cold place, using from it as 
required. 

When ready to use your paste finish the making by 
rolling it out, dredging a little flour, and doubling it in 
three as before, and roll it out thin ; do this until from 
first to last it has been so doubled and rolled seven times. 

Great cooks differ on one or two points in making 
pastry ; for instance, Soyer directs you to put the yolk 
of an Qgg instead of the white, and a squeeze of lemon 



24 Culture and Cooking. 

juice into the flour, and expressly forbids you to work it 
before adding the mass of butter, while Jules G-oaife 
says, "work it until smooth and shining." I cannot 
pretend to decide between these differing doctors, but I 
pursue the method I have given and always have light 
pastry. And now to the handling of it : It must only be 
touched by the lightest fingers, every cut must be made 
with a sharp knife, and done with one quick stroke so that 
the paste is not dragged at all ; in covering a pie dish or 
patty pan, you are commonly directed to mold the paste 
over it as thin as possible, which conveys the idea that the 
paste is to be pressed over and so made thin ; this would 
destroy the finest paste in the world ; roll it thin, say 
for small tartlets, less than a quarter of an inch thick, 
for a pie a trifle thicker, then lay the dish or tin to be 
covered on the paste, and cut out with a knife, dipped in 
liot water or flour, a piece a little larger than the mold, 
then line with the piece you have cut, touching it as little 
as possible ; press only enough to make the paste adhere 
to the bottom, but on no account press the border; to 
test the necessity of avoiding this, gently press one spot 
on a tart, before putting it in the oven, only so much as 
many people alwaj-s do in making pie, and watch the 
result. When your tartlets or pies are made, take each 
up on your left hand, and with a sharp knife dipped in 
fiour trim it round quickly. To make the cover of a 
pie adhere to the under crust, lay the forefinger of your 
right hand lengthwise round the border, but as far from 
the edge as you can, thus forming a groove for the syrups, 
and pressing the cover on at the same time. A word 
here about fruit pies : Pile the fruit high in the center, 
leaving a space all round the sides almost bare of fruit, 
when the cover is on press gently the paste, as I have 



Pastry, 25 

explained, into this groove, then make two or three deep 
holes in the groove ; the juice will boil out of these holes 
and run round this groove, instead of boiling out througli 
the edges and wasting. 

This is the pastry-cook's way of making pies, and makes 
a much handsomer one than the usual flat method, 
besides saving your sjTup. To ornament fruit pies or 
tartlets, whip the white of an egg, and stir in as much 
powdered sugar as will make a thin meringue — a large 
tablespoonful is usually enough — then when your pies or 
tartlets are baked, take them from the oven, glaze with 
the Qgg and sugar, and return to the oven, leaving the 
door open ; when it has set into a frosty icing they are 
ready to serve. 

It is worth while to accomplish puff paste, for so 
many dainty trifles may be made with it, which, at- 
tempted with the ordinary short paste, would be unsight- 
ly. Some of these that seem to me novel I will describe. 

Kissolettes are made with trimmings of puff paste; if 
you have about a quarter of a pound left, roll it out very 
thin, about as thick as a fifty-cent piece; put about half 
a spoonful of marmalade or jam on it, in places about 
an inch apart, wet lightly round each, and place a piece 
of paste over all ; take a small round cutter as large as 
a dollar, and press round the part where the marma- 
lade or jam is with the thick part of the cutter; then cut 
them out with a cutter a size larger, lay them on a bak- 
ing tin, brush over with white of egg; then cut some little 
rings the size of a quarter dollar, put one on each, egg 
over again, and bake twenty minutes in a nice hot oven; 
then sift white sugar all over, put them back in the oven 
to glaze ; a little red currant jelly in each ring looks 
pretty ; serve in the form of a pyramid. 
3 



26 Culture and Cooking. 

Pastet Tablets. — Cut strips of paste three inches 
and a half long, and an inch and a half wide, and as 
thick as a twenty-five cent piece ; lay on half of them 
a thin filmy layer of jam or marmalade, not jelly; then 
on each lay a strip without jam, and bake in a quick 
oven. When the paste is well risen and brown, take 
them out, glaze them with white of egg and sugar, 
and sprinkle chopped almonds over them ; return to 
the oven till the glazing is set and the almonds just 
colored; serve them hot or cold on a napkin piled log- 
cabin fashion. 

Peangipane Tartlets. — One quarter pint of cream, 
four yolks of eggs, two ounces of flour, three macaroons, 
four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, the peel of a 
grated lemon, and a little citron cut very fine, a little 
brandy and orange-flower water. Put all the ingredi- 
ents, except the eggs, in a saucepan — of course you will 
mix the flour smooth in the cream first — let them 
come to a boil slowly, stirring to prevent lumps ; 
when the flour smells cooked, take it oif the fire for 
a minute, then stir the beaten yolks of eggs into it. 
Stand the saucepan in another of hoiling water and re- 
turn to the stove, stirring till the eggs seem done — about 
five minutes, if the water boils all the time. Line patty 
pans with puff paste, and fill with frangipane and bake. 
Ornament with chopped almonds and meringue, or not, 
as you please. 

It is very difficult to make fine , puff paste in warm 
weather, and almost impossible without ice ; for this 
reason I think the brioche paste preferable; but if it 
is necessary to have it for any purpose, you must take 
the following precautions : 

Have your water iced ; have your butter as firm as 



Pastry. 27 

possible by being kept on ice till the last moment ; make 
the paste in the coolest place you have, and under the 
breeze of an open window, if possible ; make it the day 
before you use it, and put it on the ice between every 
" turn," as each rolling out is technically called; then 
leave it on the ice, as you use it, taking pieces from it as 
you need them, so that the warmth cannot soften the 
whole at once, when it would become quite unmanage- 
able. The condition of the oven is a very important 
matter, and I cannot do better than transcribe the rules 
given by GoufEe, by which you may test its fitness for 
any purpose : 

Put half a sheet of writing paper in the oven; if it 
catches fire it is too hot; open th6 dampers and wait 
ten minutes, when put in another piece of paper ; if it 
blackens it is still too hot. Ten minutes later put in a 
third piece ; if it gets darlc Irown the oven is right for 
all small pastry. Called "dark brown paper heat." 
Light brown paper heat is suitable for vol-au-vents or 
fruit pies. Dark yellow paper heat for large pieces of 
pastry or meat pies, pound cake, bread, etc. Light yel- 
low paper heat for sponge cake, meringues, etc. 

To obtain these various degrees of heat, you try paper 
every ten minutes till the heat required for your purpose 
is attained. But remember that " light yellow " means 
the paper only tinged ; "dark yellow," the paper the 
color of ordinary pine wood; "light brown" is only a 
shade darker, about the color of nice pie-crust, and dark 
brown a shade darker, by no means coffee color. ■ 



CHAPTER IV. 

WHAT TO HATE IN TOUB STOKE-EOOM. 

Oke great trouble with many young housekeepers is 
betrayed by the common remark, " Cookery books al- 
ways require so many things that one never has in the 
house, and they coolly order you to ' moisten with gravy,' 
' take a little gravy,' as if you had only to go to the pump 
and get it." It is very true that economy in cooking is 
much aided by having a supjjly of various condiments ; 
warmed-over meat may then be converted into a delicious 
little entree with little trouble. I would recommend, 
therefore, any one Avho is in earnest about reforming 
her dinner table to begin by expending a few dollars in 
the following articles : 



1 bottle of capers, 


1 bottle of claret. 


1 " olives. 




' white wine, 


1 " gherkins, 




' sherry for cooking, 


1 ' ' soy. 




' brandy. 


1 " anchovies. 




' Harvey sauce, 


1 " tarragon vinegar. 




' wakmt ketchup. 



And a package of compressed vegetables and a few bay leaves. 



Ten dollars thus spent may seem a good deal of money 
to a young housewife trying to make her husband's salary 
go as far as it will ; but I assure her it is in the end an 
economy, especially in a small family, who are so apt to 
get tired of seeing the same thing, that it has to be 

38 



W/iai to Have in Your Store-room. 29 

thro-wn or given away. With these condiments and 
others I have yet to mention you will' have no trouble 
in using every scrap ; not using it and eating it from a 
sense of duty, and wishing it was something better, but 
enjoying it. With your store-room well provided, you 
can indeed go for gravy " as if to the pump." 

Besides the foregoing lisb of articles to be bought of 
any good grocer, there are others which can be made at 
home to advantage, and once made are always ready. 
Mushroom powder 1 prefer for any use to mushroom 
catsup ; it is easily made and its uses are infinite. 
Sprinkled over steak (when it must be sifted) or chops, 
it is delicious. For ordinary purposes, such as flavoring 
soup or gravy, it need not be sifted. To prepare it, take 
a peck of large and very fresh mushrooms, look them over 
carefully that they are not wormy, then cleanse them 
■with a piece of flannel from sand or grit, then peel them 
and put them in the sun or a cool oven to dry ; they re- 
quire long, slow drying, and must become in a state to 
crumble. Your peck will have diminished by the pro- 
cess into half a pint or less of mushroom powder, but 
you have the means with it of making a rich gravy at a 
few minutes' notice. 

Apropos of gravies — that much-vexed question in 
small households — for without gravies on hand you can- 
not make good hash, or many other things that are mis- 
erable without, and excellent with it. Yet how difficult 
it is to have gravy always on hand every mistress of a 
small family knows, in spite of the constant advice to 
" save your trimming to make stock." Do by all means 
save your bones, gristle, odds and ends of meat of all 
kinds, and convert them into broth ; but even if you 
do, it often happens that the days you have done so no 



30 Culture and Cooking. 

gravy is required, and then it sours quickly in summer, 
although it may be arrested by reboiling. In no family 
of three or four are there odds and ends enough, unless 
there is a very extravagant table kept, to insure stock for 
every day. My remedy for this, then, is to make a 
stock that will keep for months or years — in other words, 
glaze. So very rarely forming part of a housewife's 
stores, yet so valuable that the fact is simply astonish- 
ing ; with a piece of glaze, you have a dish of soup on 
an emergency, rich gravy for any purpose, and all with 
the expenditure of less time than would make a pot of 
sweetmeats. 

Take six pounds of a knuckle of veal or leg of beef, 
cut it in pieces the size of an egg, as also half a pound 
of lean ham ; then rub a quarter of a pound of butter on 
the bottom of your pot, which should hold two gallons ; 
then put in the meat with half a pint of water, three 
middle-sized onions, with two cloves in each, a turnip, a 
carrot, and a small head of celery ; then place over a 
quick fire, occasionally stirring it round, until the bot- 
tom of the pot is covered with a thick glaze, which will 
adhere lightly to the spoon ; then fill up the pot with 
cold water, and when on the boiling point, draw it to the 
back of the stove, where it may gently simmer three 
hours, if veal, six if beef, carefully skimming it to re- 
move scum. This stock, as it is, will make a delicious 
foundation, with the addition of salt, for all kinds of 
clear soup or gravies. To reduce it to glaze proceed as 
follows : Pass the stock through a fine hair sieve or 
cloth into a pan ; then fill up the pot again with liot 
water, and let it boil four hours longer to obtain all the 
glutinous part from the meat ; strain, and pour both 
stocks in a large pot or stew-pan together ; set it over the 



What to Have in Your Store-room. 31 

fire, and let it boil as fast as possible with the lid off, 
leaving a large spoon in it to prevent it boiling over, and 
to stir occasionally. "When reduced to about three pints, 
pour it into a small stew-pan or saucepan, set again to 
boil, but more slowly, skimming it if necessary ; when 
it is reduced to a quart, set it where it will again boil 
quickly, stirring it well with a wooden spoon until it 
begins to get thick and of a fine yellowish-brown color ; 
at this point be careful it does not burn. 

You may either pour it into a pot for use, or, what is 
more convenient for making gravies, get a sausage skin 
from your butcher, cut a yard of it, tie one end very 
tightly, then pour into it by means of a large funnel the 
glaze ; from this cut slices for use. A thick slice dis- 
solved in hot water makes a cup of nutritious soup, into 
which you may put any cooked vegetables, or rice, or 
barley. A piece is very useful to take on a journey, 
especially for an invalid who does not want to depend on 
wayside hotel food, or is tired of beef-tea. 

The foregoing is the orthodox recipe for glaze, and if 
you have to buy meat for the purpose the very best way 
in which you can make it ; but if it happen that you 
have some strong meat soup or jelly, for which you have 
no use while fresh, .then boil it down till it is thick and 
brown (not burnt) ; it will be excellent glaze ; not so fine 
in fiavor, perhaps, but it preserves to good use what 
would otherwise be lost. Very many people do not 
know the value of pork for making jelly. If you live in 
the country and kill a pig, use his hocks for making glaze 
instead of beef. 

Glaze also adds much to the beauty of many dishes. 
If roast beef is not quite brown enough on any one spot 
set your jar of glaze— for this purpose it is well to have 



32 Culture and Cooking. 

some put in a jar as well as in the skin — in boiling water. 
Keep a small stiff brush ; such as are sold for the pur- 
pose at house-furnishing stores, called a glazing brush, 
are best ; but you may manage with any other or even a 
stiff feather. When the glaze softens, as glue would do, 
brush oyer your meat with it, it will give the lacking 
brown ; or, if you have a ham or tongue you wish to 
decorata you may " varnish " it, as it were, with the 
melted glaze ; then when cold beat some fresh butter to 
a white cream, and with a kitchen syringe, if you have 
one, a stiff paper funnel if you have not, trace any 
design you please on the glazed surface ; this makes a 
very handsome dish, and if your ham has been properly 
boiled will be very satisfactory to the palate. Of the 
boiling of ham I will speak iu another chapter. 

I have a few more articles to recommend for your 
store-room, and then I think you will find yourseli equal 
to the emergency of providing an elegant little meal if 
called upon unexpectedly, provided you have any cold 
scraps at all in the house, and maitre d'hotel butter. 

To make the latter, take half a pound of fine butter, 
one tablespoonful of very fresh parsley, chopped not too 
fine, salt, pepper, and a small tablespoonful of lemon 
juice ; mix together, but do not work more than suffi- 
cient for that purpose, and pack in a jar, keeping it in a 
cool place. A tablesijoonful of this laid in a hot dish 
on which you serve beefsteak, chops, or any kind of fish, 
is a great addition, and turns plain boiled potatoes into 
pomme de terre a la maifre d'hotel. It is excellent with 
stewed potatoes, or added to anything for which parsley 
is needed, and not always at hand ; a spoonful with half 
the quantity of flour stirred into a gill of milk or water 
makes the renowned maitre d'Mtel sauce (or English 



WAat to Have in Your Store-room. 33 

parsley butter) for boiled fish, mutton, or veal. In 
short, it is one of the most valuable things to have in 
the house. Equally valuable, even, and more elegant is 
the preparation known as "Eavigotte" or Montpellier 
butter. 

Take one pound in equal quantities of chervil, tarra- 
gon, burnet (pimpernel), chives, and garden cress (pep- 
pergrass) ; scald two minutes, drain quite dry ; pound in 
a mortar three hard eggs, three anchovies, and one scant 
ounce of pickled cucumbers, and same quantity of capers 
well pressed to extract the vinegar ; add salt, pepper, and 
a bit of garlic half as large as a pea, rub all through a 
sieve ; then put a pound of fine butter into the mortar, 
which must be well cleansed from the herbs, add the 
herbs, with two tablespoonf uls of oil and one of tarragon 
vinegar, mix perfectly, and if not of a fine green, add 
the juice of some pounded spinach. 

This is the celebrated "heurre de Montpellier," sold 
in Paris in tiny jars at a high price. Eavigotte is the 
same thing, only in place of the eggs, anchovies, pickles, 
and capers, put half a pound more butter ; it is good, but 
less piquant. 

Pack in a jar, and keep cool. This butter is excel- 
lent for many purposes. For salad, beaten with oil, 
vinegar, and yolks of eggs, as for mayonnaise, it makes 
a delicious dressing. For cold meat or fish it is excel- 
lent, and also for chops. 

Two or three other articles serve to simplify the art of 
cooking in its especially difficult branches, and in the 
branches a lady finds difficult to attend to herself with- 
out remaining in the kitchen until the last minute before 
dinner ; but with the aid of blanc and roux a fairly 
intelligent girl can make excellent sauces. 
3* 



34 Culture and Cooking. 

For roux melt slowly half a pound of butter over the 
firCj skim it, let it settle, then dredge in eight ounces of 
fine flour, stir it till it is of a bright brown, then put 
away in a jar for use. 

Blanc is the same thing, only it is not allowed to 
brown ; it should be stirred only enough to make all hot 
through, then put away in a jar. 

If you need thickening for a white sauce and do not 
wish to stand over it yourself, having taught your cook 
the simple fact that a piece of blanc put into the milk 
iefore it boils (or it will harden instead of melt) and 
allowed to dissolve, stirring constantly, will make the 
sauce you wish, she will be able at all times to produce 
a white sauce that you need not be ashamed of. When 
the sauce is nearly ready to serve, stir in a good piece of 
butter — a large spoonful to half a pint ; when mixed, 
the sauce is ready. Brown sauce can always be made 
by taking a cup of broth or soup and dissolving in the 
same way a piece of the roux ; and also, if desired, a 
jjiece of Montpellier butter. If there is no soup of course 
you make it with a piece of glaze. 

Brown flour is also a convenient thing to have ready ; 
it is simply cooking flour in the oven until it is a pale 
brown ; if it is allowed to get dark it will be bitter, and, 
that it may brown evenly, it requires to be laid on a large 
flat baking pan and stirred often. Useful for thickening 
stews, hash, etc. 



CHAPTER V. 

LUNCHEON. 

LtJNCHEOiir is usually, in this country, either a forlorn 
meal of cold meat or hash, or else a sort of early dinner, 
both of which are a mistake. If it is veritably lunclieon, 
and not early dinner, it should be as unlike that later 
meal as possible for variety's sake, and, in any but very 
small families, there are so many dishes more suitable 
for luncheon than any other meal, that it is easy to 
have great variety with very little trouble. 

I wish it were more the fashion here to have many of 
the cold dishes which are popular on the other side the 
Atlantic ; and, in spite of the fact that table prejudices 
are very dilScuIt to get over, I will append a few recipes 
in the hope that some lady, more progressive than prej- 
udiced, may give them a trial, convinced that their ex- 
cellence, appearance, and convenience will win them 
favor. 

By having most dishes cold at luncheon, it makes it a 
distinct meal from the hot breakfast and dinner. In 
summer, the cold food and a salad is especially refresh- 
ing ; in winter, a nice hot soup or puree — thick soup is 
preferable at luncheon to clear, which is well fitted to 
precede a heavy meal — and some savory entree are very 
desirable, while cold raised pie, galantine, jellied fish, and 
potted meats may ever, at that season, find their appro- 
priate place on the luncheon table. The potatoes, which 



36 Culture and Cooking. 

are the only yegetable introduced at strict lunch, should 
be prepared in some fancy manner, as croquettes, mashed 
and browned, a la mditre d'hotel, or in snow. The latter 
mode is pretty and novel ; I will, therefore, include it 
in my recipes for luncheon dishes. Omelets, too, are 
excellent at luncheon. 

In these remarks I am thinking especially of large 
families, whose luncheon table might be provided with 
a dish of galantine, one of collared fish, and a meat pie, 
besides the steak, cutlets, or warmed-over meat, without 
anything going to waste. In winter most cold jellied 
articles will keep a fortnight, and in summer three or 
four days. 

Windsor Pie.— Take slices of veal cutlet, half an 
inch thick, and very thin slices of lean boiled ham ; put 
at the bottom of one of these veal-pie dishes or "bak- 
ers," about two to three inches deep, a layer of the veal, 
seasoned, then one of ham, then one of force-meat, made 
as follows : Take a little veal, or if you have sausage- 
meat ready-made, it will do, as much fine dry bread- 
crumbs, a dessert- spoonful of finely chopped parsley, in 
which is a salt-spoonful of powdered thyme, savory, and 
marjoram, if you have them, with salt and pepper, and 
mix with enough butter to make it a crumbling paste; 
lay a thi?i layer of this on the ham, then another of veal, 
then ham and force-meat again, until the dish is quite 
full. Lay something flat upon it, and then a weight for 
an hour. You must have prepared, from bones and 
scraps of veal, about a pint of stiff veal jelly ; pour this 
over the meat, and then take strips of rich puff paste 
(the brioche paste would be excellent in hot weather), 
wet the edge of the dish, and lay the strips round, press- 
ing them lightly to the dish ; roll the cover a little 



Luncheon. 37 

larger than the top of the dish, and lay it on, first wet- 
ting the surface, not the edge, of- the strips round the 
lips of the dish ; press the two together, then make a hole 
in the center and ornament as you please ; but I never 
ornament the edge of a pie, as it is apt to prevent the 
paste from rising. An appropriate and simple ornament 
for meat pies is to roll a piece of paste very thin, cut it 
in four diamond-shaped pieces, put one point of each to 
the hole in the center so that you have one on each end, 
and one each side, then roll another little piece of paste 
as thin as possible, flour it and double it, then double it 
again, bring all the corners together in your hand, like 
a little bundle, then with a sharp knife give a quick cut 
over the top of the ball of paste, cutting quite deeply, 
then another across ; if your cut has been clean and 
quick, you will now be able to turn half back the leaves 
of paste as if it were a half-blown rose. The ends which 
you have gathered together in your hand are to be in- 
serted in the hole in the center of the pie. Then brush 
over with yolk of egg beaten very well in a little milk or 
water, and bake an hour and a half. 

This way of covering and ornamenting a pie is ap- 
propriate for all meat pies ; pigeon pie should, however, 
have the little red feet skinned by dipping in boiling 
water, then rubbed in a cloth, when skin and nails peel 
off ; if allowed to lie in the water, the flesh comes too; 
then one pair is put at each end of the pie, a hole being 
cut to insert them, or four are put in the center instead 
of the rose. 

The Windsor pie is intended to be eaten cold, as are all 
veal and ham pies, the beauty of the jelly being lost in 
a hot pie. Do not fail to try it on that account, for 
cold pies are excellent things. 



38 Culture and Cooking. 

Anothee veal and ham pie, more usual, and proba- 
bly the "weal and hammer" that " mellered the organ" 
of Silas Wegg, was manufactured by Mrs. Boffln from 
this recipe ; it is as follows : 

Take the thick part of breast of Teal, remoTing all the 
bones, which put on for gravy, stewing them long and 
slowly; put a layer of Teal, pepper and salt, then a thin 
sprinkling of ham; if boiled, cut in slices; if raw, cut a 
slice in dice, which scald before using, then more veal 
and again ham. If force-meat balls are liked, make 
some force-meat as for Windsor pie, using if you prefer it 
chopped hard-boiled eggs in place of chopped meat, and 
binding into a paste with a raw ^gg ; then make into 
balls, which drop into the crcTices of the pie ; boil two 
or three eggs quite hard, cut each in four and lay them 
round the sides and OTer the top, pour in about a gill of 
graTy, and coTer the same as the Windsor pie. In either 
of these pies the force-meat may be left out, a sweetbread 
cut up, or mushroons put in. 

A chicken pie to eat cold is very fine made in this way. 

Eaised pokk pies are so familiar to eTery one who has 
Tisited England, and, in spite .of the greasy idea, are so 
Tery good, that I introduce a well-tried recipe, feeling 
sure any one who eats pork at all will find it worth while 
to give them a trial; they will follow it with manyanother. 

The paste for them is made as follows : 

Eub into two pounds of flour a liberal half pound of 
butter, then melt in half a pint of hot, but not boiling 
milk, another half pound — or it may be lard; pour this 
into the flour, and knead it into a smooth, firm paste. 
Properly raised pies should be molded by hand, and I will 
endeaTor to describe the method in case any perscTcr- 
ing lady would like to try and have the orthodox thing. 



Luncheon. 39 

But pie molds of tin, opening at the side, are to be 
bought, and saye much trouble; the mold, if used, should 
be well buttered, and the pie taken out when done, and 
returned to the oven for the sides to brown. 

To " raise" a pie, proceed thus : "While the paste is 
warm, form a ball of paste into a cone; then with the 
fist work inside it, till it forms an oval cup ; continue to 
knead till you have the walls of an even thickness, then 
pinch a fold all around the bottom. If properly done, 
you have an oval, flat-bottomed crust, with sides about 
two inches high ; fill this with pork, fat and lean 
together, well peppered and salted; then work an oval 
cover, as near the size of the bottom cover as you can, 
and wet the edges of the wall, lay the cover on, and 
pinch to match the bottom; ornament as directed for 
Windsor pie, wash with egg, and bake a pale brown in a 
moderate oven ; they must be well cooked, or the meat 
will not be good. One containing a pound of meat may 
be cooked an hour and a quarter. All these pies are 
served in slices, cut through to the bottom. 

Galantines are very handsome dishes, not very difficult 
to make, and generally popular. I give a recipe for a 
very simple and delicious one : 

Take a fine breast of veal, remove all gristle, tendons, 
bones, and trim to fifteen inches in length and eight 
wide; use the trimmings and bones to help make the 
jelly, then put on the meat a layer of force-meat made 
thus : Take one pound of sausage meat, or lean veal, to 
which add half a pound of bread-crumbs, parsley and 
thyme to taste; grate a little nutmeg, pepper, salt, and 
the juice of half a lemon ; have also some long strips an 
inch thick of fat bacon or pork, and lean of veal, and 
lean ham, well seasoned with pepper, salt, and finely 



40 Culture and Cooking. 

chopped shallots. Lay on the meat a layer of force- 
meat an inch thick, leaving an inch and a half on each 
side uncovered ; then lay on your strips of ham, veal, 
and bacon fat, alternately; then another of force-meat, 
but only half an inch thick, as too much force-meat 
will spoil the appearance of the dish ; if you have any 
cold tongue, lay some strips in, also a few blanched 
pistachio nuts (to be obtained of a confectioner) will 
give the appearance of true French galantine. Eoll up 
the veal, and sew it with a packing or coarse needle and 
fine twine, tie it firmly up in a piece of linen. Observe 
that you do not put your pistachio nuts amid the force- 
meat, where, being green, their appearance would be lost; 
put them in crevices of the meats. 

Cook this in sufficient water to cover, in which you 
must have the trimmings of the breast and a knuckle of 
veal, or hock of pork, two onions, a carrot, half a head 
of celery, two cloves, a blade of mace, and a good bunch 
of parsley, thyme and bay leaf, two ounces of salt. Set 
the pot on the fire till it is at boiling point, then draw 
it to the back and let it simmer three hours, skimming 
carefully ; then take it from the fire, leaving it in the 
stock till nearly cold; then take it out, remove the string 
from the napkin, and roll the galantine up tighter — if 
too tight at first it will be hard — tying the napkin at 
each end only; then place it on a dish, set another dish 
on it, on which place a fourteen-pound weight; this will 
cause it to cut firm. When quite cold, remove strings 
and cloth, and it is ready to be ornamented with Jelly. 
When the stock in which the galantine was cooked is cold 
take off the fat and clarify it, first trying, however, if it 
is in right condition, by platting a little on ice. If it is 
not stiif enough to cut firm, you must reduce it by boil-

ing ; if too stiff, that is approaching glaze, add a little 
water, then clarify by adding whites of eggs, as directed 
to clarify soup (see soups). A glass of sherry and two 
spoonfuls of tarragon or common vinegar are a great 
improyement. Some people like this jelly cut in dice, 
to ornament the galantine, part of it may then also serve 
to ornament other dishes at the table. But I prefer to 
have the galantine enveloped in jelly, which may be done 
by putting it in an oblong soup tureen or other vessel 
that will contain it, leaving an inch space all round, 
then pouring the jelly over it. 

Jellied fish is a favorite dish with many, and is very 
simple to prepare ; it is also very ornamental. Take 
flounders or almost any flat fish that is cheapest at the 
time you require them. Clean and scrape them, cut 
them in small pieces, but do not cut off the fins ; put 
them in a stew-pan with a few small button onions or 
one large one, a half teaspoonful of sugar, a glass of 
sherry, a dessert-spoonful of lemon juice, and a small 
bunch ^f parsley. To one large flounder put a quart of 
water, and if you are going to jelly oysters put in their 
liquor and a little salt. Stew long and slowly, skim- 
ming well ; then strain, and if not perfectly clear clarify 
as elsewhere directed. (See if your stock jellies, by try- 
ing it on ice before you clarify.) l^ow take a mold, put 
in it pieces of cold salmon, eels that have been cooked, 
or oysters, the latter only just cooked enough in the 
stock to plump them ; pour a little of the jelly in the 
mold, then three or four half slices of lemon, then oys- 
ters or the cold fish, until the mold is near full, dis- 
posing the lemon so that it will be near the sides and 
decorate the jelly ; then pour the rest of the jelly over 
all and stand in boiling water for a few minutes, then 



42 Culture and Cooking. 

put it in a cold place, on ice is best, for some hours. 
When about to serve, dip the mold in hot water, turn 
out on a dish, garnish with lettuce leaves or parsley and 
hard-boiled eggs. The latter may be introduced into 
the Jelly cut in quarters if it is desired ; very ornamen- 
tal force-meat balls made bright green with spinach juice 
are also an improvement in appearance. 

A New Matoitnaise (Soyer's). — Put a quarter of a 
pint of stiff veal jelly (that has been nicely flavored with 
vegetables) on ice in a bowl, whisking it till it is a white 
froth ; then add half a pint of salad oil and six spoon- 
fuls of tarragon vinegar, iy degrees, first oil, then vine- 
gar, continually whisking till it forms a white, smooth, 
sauce-like cream ; season with half a teaspoonful of salt, 
a quarter ditto of white pepper, and a very little sugar, 
whisk it a little more and it is ready. It should be 
dressed pyramidically over the article it is served with. 
The advantage of this sauce is that (although more deli- 
cate than any other) you may dress it to any height 
you like, and it will remain so any length of time ; if 
the temperature is cool, it will remain hours without 
appearing greasy or melting. It is absolutely necessary, 
however, that it should be prepared on ice. 

All these dishes, however, are only adapted for large 
families, but there are several ways of improving on the 
ordinary lunch table of very small ones. And nothing 
is more pleasant for the mistress of one of these very 
small families than to have a friend drop in to lunch, 
and have a rechercM lunch to offer with little trou.b]e. 
Warming over will aid her in this, and to that chapter 
I refer her ; but there are one or two ways of having 
cold relishes always ready, which help out an impromptu 
meal wonderfully. 



Luncheon. 43 

Potted meats are a great resource to English house- 
keepers ; this side the Atlantic they are chiefly known 
through the medium of Cross & Blackwell, though lat- 
terly one or two American firms have introduced some 
very admirable articles of the sort. Home-made potted 
meats are, however, better and less expensive than those 
bought ; they should be packed away in jars, Liebig's 
extract of meat jars not being too small for the purpose, 
as, while covered with the fat they keep well ; once 
opened, they require eating within a week or ten days, 
except in very cold weather. 

Potted bloater is one of the least expensive and appe- 
tizing of all potted meats. To make it, take two or three 
or more bloaters, cut off the heads and cleanse them, put 
them in the oven long enough to cook them through; 
take them out, take ofE the skin, and remove the meat 
from the bones carefully ; put the meat of the fish in a 
jar with half its weight of butter, leave it to slowly cook 
in a cool oven for an hour, then take it out, put the fish 
into a mortar or strong dish, pour the butter on it care- 
fully, but don't let the gravy pass too, unless the fish is 
to be eaten very quickly, as it would prevent it keeping.. 
Beat both butter and fish till they form a paste, add a 
little cayenne, and press it into small pots, pouring on 
each melted butter, or mu.tton suet. Either should be 
the third of an inch thick on the bloater. This makes 
excellent sandwiches. 

Potted Ham. —Take any remains of ham you have, 
even fried, if of a nice quality, is good for the purpose ; 
take away all stringy parts, sinew, or gristle, put it in a 
slow oven with its weight of butter, let it stay macerat- 
ing in the butter till very tender, then beat it in a mor- 
tar, add cayenne, and pack in pots in the same way as 



44 Culture and Cooking. 

the bloater. Thus you may pot odds and ends of any 
meat or fish you have, and as a little potted meat goes a 
long way, when you have a little lobster, a bit of chicken 
breast, or even cold veal, I advise you to use it in this 
way ; you will then have a little stock of dainties in the 
house to fall back on at any time for unexpected calls — 
a very important thing in the country. 

Potted chicken or veal requires either a little tongue 
or lean ham to give flavor ; but failing these, a little 
ravigotte butter, beaten in after the meat is well 
pounded, is by no means a bad substitute. 

Many people like the flavor of anchovies, but do not 
like the idea of eating raw fish ; for these anchovy but- 
ter is very acceptable. 

Take the anchovies out of the liquor in which they are 
packed, but do not wash them, put them in twice their 
weight of butter in a jar, which stand in boiling water ; 
set all back of the stove for an hour, then pound, add 
cayenne, and pack in glasses. 

Unexpected company to luncheon with a lady who has 
to eat that meal alone generally, and (as is the unwise 
way of such ladies) makes it a very slender meal, is one 
of the ordeals of a young housekeeper ; company to lunch 
and nothing in the house. But there is generally a 
dainty luncheon in every house if you know how to pre- 
pare it ; there certainly always will be if you keep your 
store-room supplied with the things I have named. Let 
the. table be prettily laid at all times, then if you have 
potted meat and preserves, have them put on the table. 
Are there cold potatoes? If so cut them up into potato 
salad, if they are whole ; if broken, warm them in a 
wine-glass of milk, a teaspoonful of flour, and a piece 
as large as an Qgg of maitre d'Mtel butter. Have you 



Luncheon. 45 

such scraps of cold meat as could not come to table? Toss 
them up with a half cup of water, a slice of glaze (oh, 
blessed ever-ready glaze!) a teaspoonfal of ravigotte, or 
maitre d'lwtel, and a teaspoonful of roux or blanc, ac- 
cording as your meat is light or dark, season, and serve. 
Or you have no meat, then you have eggs, and what bet- 
ter than an omelet and such an omelet as the following? 
Take the crumb of a slice of bread, soak it in hot milk 
(cold will do, but hot is better), beat up whites of four 
eggs to a high froth; mix the bread with all the milk it 
will absorb, no more, into a paste, add the yolks of eggs 
with a little salt, set the pan on the fire with an ounce of 
butter. Let it get very hot, then mix the whites of eggs 
with the yolks and bread lightly, pour in the pan, and 
move about for a minute ; if the oven is hot, when the 
omelet is brown underneath, set the pan in the oven 
for five minutes, or until the top is set ; then double 
half over, and serve. K your guests have a liking for 
sweets, and your potted meats supply the savory part of 
your luncheon, then have a brown gravy ready to serve 
with it. Put into a half cup of boiling water a slice of 
glaze, a spoonful of roiix, and enough Harvey sauce, or 
mushroom powder, to flavor. If your omelet is to be 
sweet, before you fold it put in a layer of preserves. 

The advantage of the omelet I have here given is 
that it keeps plump and tender till cold, so that five 
minutes of waiting does not turn it into leather, the 
great objection with omelets generally. 1 

Potatoes for luncheon, as I have said, should always 
be prepared in some fancy way, and snow is a very pretty 
one. Have some fine mealy potatoes boiled, carefully 
poured off, and set back of the stove with a cloth over 
them till they are quite dry and fall apart ; then have a 



46 Culture and Cooking. 

colander, or coarse wire sieve made liot and a Jiot dish in 
whicli to serve them, pass the floury potatoes through 
the sieve, taking care not to crush the snow as it falls. 
You require a large dish heaping full, and be careful 
it is kept hot. 

This mode of preparing potatoes, although very pretty 
and novel, must never be attempted with any but the 
whitest and mealiest kind. 

The remains of cold potatoes may be prepared thus: 
Put three ounces of butter in a frying-pan in which fry 
three onions sliced till tender, but not very brown, then 
put on the potatoes cut in slices, and shake them till 
they are of a nice brown color, put a spoonful of chopped 
parsley, salt, pepper, and juice of a lemon, shake well 
that all may mix together, dish, and serve very hot. 



CHAPTEE VI. 

A CHAPTEE OSr GENERAL MANAGEMENT IN VEKT 
SMALL FAMILIES. 

A VEKT small family, "a, young iiunage," for in- 
stance, is very much more difficult to cater for without 
waste than a larger one; two people are so apt to get tired 
of anything, be it ever so good eating, when it has been 
on the table once or twice; therefore it would be useless 
to make galantine or the large pies I have indicated, ex- 
cept for occasions when guests are expected ; but, as I 
hope to aid young housekeepers to have nice dishes when 
alone, I will devote this chapter to their needs. 

The chapter on " Warming Over " will be very useful 
also to this large class. 

In the first place it is well to have regard, when part 
of a dish leaves the table, as to whether it, or any partic- 
ular part of it, will make a nice little cold dish, or a re- 
chauffe; in that case have it saved, unless it is required 
for the servants' dinner (it is well to manage so that it is 
not needed for that purpose); for instance, if there is the 
wing and a slice or two of the breast of a chicken left, it 
will make a dainty little breakfast dish, or cold, in jelly, 
be nice for lunch. There is always jelly if you have 
roast chicken, if you manage properly, and this is how 
you do it : 

Carefully save the feet, throat, gizzard, and liver of 
your chickens; scald the feet by pouring boiling water 

47 



48 Culture and Cooking. 

over them; leave them jrist a minute, and pull off the 
outer skin and nails; they come away very readily, leav- 
ing the feet delicately white; put these with the other 
giblets, properly cleansed, into a small saucepan with an 
onion, a slice of carrot, a sprig of parsley, and a pint of 
water (if you have tlie giblets of one chicken), if of 
two, put a quart; let this slowly simmer for two hours 
and a half; it will be reduced to about half, and form a 
stiff Jelly when cold; a glass of sherry, and squeeze of 
lemon, or teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar, makes this 
into a delicious aspic, and should be added if to be eaten 
cold. The jelly must of course be strained. 

In roasting chickens, if you follow the rule for meat, 
that is, put no water in the pan, but a piece of butter, and 
dredge a very little flour over the chicken, you will have 
a nice brown glaze at the bottom of the pan, provided 
it has been cooked in a quich ovetij if in a cool oven 
there will be nothing brown at all ; but we will suppose 
the bird is browned to a turn ; pour your gravy from the 
giblets into the pan, take off every bit of the glaze or 
osmazone that adheres, and let it dissolve, rubbing it 
with the back of the spoon ; then, if you are likely to 
have any chicken left cold, pour off a little gravy in a 
cup through a fine strainer, leaving in your pan suffi- 
cient for the dinner ; in this mash up the liver till it is 
a smooth paste which thickens the gravy, and serve. 
Some object to liver, therefore the use of it is a matter 
of taste. If you dress the chickens English iashion, you 
will need the liver and gizzard to tuck under the wings ; 
in this case, stew only the feet and throat, using a little 
meat of any kind, if you have it, to take their place ; 
but on no account fail to use the feet, as they are as rich 
in jelly as calves' feet in proportion to their size. 



General Management in Small Families. 49 

The jelly laid aside will be enough to ornament and 
give relish to a little dish of cold chicken, and changes 
it from a dry and commonplace thing to a recherche one. 
If two chickens are cooked it is more economical than 
one ; there is, then, double the amount of gravy, gener- 
ally sufficient, if you lay some very nice pieces of cold 
chicken in a bowl, to pour over it and leave it enveloped 
in jelly ; you still tlien, if from dinner for two people, 
have perhaps joints enough to make a dish of curry or 
fricassee, or any of the many ways in which cold chicken 
may be used, for which see chapter on "Warming Over." 

For small households large joints are to be avoided, 
but even a small roast is a large joint when there are but 
two or three to eat it. For this reason it is a good plan 
to buy such joints as divide well. A sirloin of beef is 
better made into two fine dishes than into one roast, 
and then warmed over twice. Every one knows that 
"Filet de hrnuf Chateaubriand'" is one of the classical 
dishes of the French table, that to a Frenchman luxury 
can go no further ; but every one does not know how 
entirely within his power it is to have that dish as often 
as he has roast beef ; how convenient it would be to so 
have it. Here it is : When your sirloin roast comes from 
the butcher, take out the tenderloin or fillets, which you 
must always choose thick ; cut it across into steaks an 
inch thick, trim them, cover them with a coat of butter 
(or oil, which is much better), and broil them ten min- 
utes, turning them often ; garnish with fried potatoes, 
and serve with sauce Chateaiibriand, as follows : Put a 
gill of white wine (or claret will do if you have no 
white) into a saucepan, with a piece of glaze, weighing 
an ounce and a half ; add three quarters of a pint of 
espagnole, and simmer fifteen minutes ; when ready to 
3 



50 - Culture and Cooking. 

serTe, thicken with two ounces of mattre d'Mtel butter 
in which a dessert-spoonful of flour has been worked. 
That is how Jules GoufEe's recipe runs ; but, as no small 
family will keep espagnole ready made, allow a little more 
glaze (of course the recipe as giyen may be divided to 
half or quarter, provided the correct proportions are 
retained), and use a tablespoonf ul of roux and the maltre 
d'hotel butter, both of which you have probably in your 
store-room ; if not, brown a little flour, chop some pars- 
ley, and add to two ounces of butter ; work them to- 
gether, then let them dissolve in the sauce, for which 
purpose let it go ofl: the boil ; let the sauce simmer a 
minute, skim, and serve. 

The sirloin of beef, denuded of its fillet, is still a good 
roast ; and as you can't have your cake and eat it too, 
and hot fresh roast beef is better than the same warmed 
over, warm ye never so wisely, I think this plan may 
commend itself to those who like nice little dinners. 

A nice little dinner of a soup, an entree, or made dish, 
salad, and dessert, really costs no more than frequent 
roast meat, or even steak and pudding, by following 
some such plan as this : 

Sunday. — Pot-au-feu and roast lamb, leg of mutton 
or other good joint, etc. 

Monday.— Eice or vermicelli soup made with remains 
of the iouillon fi'om pot-au-feu. If the Sunday joint 
was a fore or hindquarter of lamb it should have been 
divided, say the leg from the loin, thus providing choice 
roasts for two days, and yet having enough cold lamb — 
that favorite dish with so many — for luncheon with a sal- 
ad ; and, surprising to say, after hot roast lamb for dinner 
Sunday, cold lunch for Monday, another roast Monday, 
and cold or warmed up for lunch Tuesday, there will 



General Management in Small Families. ^\ 

-still be (supposing as I do, in preparing this chapter, 
that the family consists only of gentleman, lady, and ser- 
vant) remains enough from the two cold joints to make 
cromesquis of lamb (see recipe), a little dish of mince, or 
a delicate sauU of lamb for breakfast. It is surprising 
■wbat may be done with odds and ends in a small fam- 
ily ; a tiny plate of pieces, far too small to make an ap- 
pearance on the table, and which, if special directions 
are not given, will seem to Bridget not worth saving, 
will, with each piece dipped into the batter a la Careme, 
and fried in hot fat, make a tempting dish for breakfast, 
or an entree for dinner or luncheon. Two tablespoonfuls 
only of chopped meat of any kind, will make croquettes 
for two or three people ; hence, ' save the pieces.' But 
to return to our bills of fare : I have given the two roasts 
of lamb for consecutive days, because the weather in 
lamb season is usually too warm to keep it ; when this 
can be done, however, it is pleasanter to leave the second 
joint of lamb till Tuesday. Should a f orequarter (abroad 
held in greater esteem than the hindquarter) have been 
chosen, get the butcher to take out the shoulder in one 
round thick joint, English fashion ; this crisply roasted 
is far more delicious than the leg ; you then have the 
chops to be breaded, and an excellent dish of the neck 
and breast, either broiled, curried, stewed with peas, or 
roast. 

Yet how often we see a whole quarter of lamb put in 
the oven for two or three people who get tired of the 
sight of it cold, yet feel in economy bound to eat it. 

Should sirloin of beef have been the Sunday dinner, 
you will know what to do with it, from directions al- 
ready given; and as a sirloin of beef, even with the fillet 
out, will be more than required for one dinner, it may 



52 Culture and Cooking. 

serve for a third day, dressed in one of the various ways 
I shall give in chapter on "Warming Over." You have 
still at your disposal the bouilli or beef from which you 
have made your pot-au-feu, which, if it has been care- 
fully boiled, not galloped, nor allowed to fall to rags, is 
very good eating. Out thin with lettuce, or in winter 
celery, in about equal quantities, and a good salad dress- 
ing, it is excellent; or, made into hash, f ritadella, or even 
rissoles, is savory and delicious ; only bear in mind with 
this, as all cooked meats, the gravy drawn out must be 
replaced by stock or glaze ; it is very easy to warm over 
bouilli satisfactorily, as a cup of the soup made from it 
can always be kept for gravy. 

A leg of mutton makes two excellent joints, and is 
seldom liked cold — as beef and lamb often are. 

Select a large fine leg, have it cut across, that each 
part may weigh about equally; roast the thick or fillet end 
and serve with or without onion sauce (a la soubise) ; 
boil the knuckle in a small quantity of water, just 
enough to cover it, with a carrot, turnip, onion, and 
bunch of parsley, and salt in the water, serve with caper 
sauce and mashed turnips. The broth from this is ex- 
cellent soup served thus : Skim it carefully, take out 
the vegetables, and chop a small quantity of parsley very 
fine, then beat up in a bowl two eggs, pour into them a 
little of the broth — not boiling — beating all the time, 
then draw your soup back till it is off the boil, and pour 
in the eggs, stirring continually till it is on the boiling 
point again (but it must not boil, or the eggs will cur- 
dle and spoil the soup), and then turn it into a hot tureen 
and serve. Use remains of the cold roast and boiled mut- 
ton together, to make made dishes; between the days of 
having the roast and boiled mutton you may have had a 



General Maitagement in Small Families. 53 

fowl, and the remains from that will make you a second 
dish to go with your joint. 

The remains from the first cooked muttbn, in form 
of curry, mince, salmi, or sauU, will be a second dish 
with your fowl. 

Veal is one of the most conyenient things to have for 
a small family, as it warms ovet in a variety of ways, and 
in some is actually better than when put on the table as 
a Joint. By haying a little fish one day, instead of soup, 
and a little game another, and remembering when you 
have an especially dainty thing, to have one with it a 
little more substantial and less costly, you may have vari- 
ety at little expense. 

For instance, if you find it convenient to have for din- 
ner fritadelle (see " Warming Over'") or miroton of beef, 
or cold mutton curried, you might have broiled birds, or 
roast pigeon, or game. In this consists good manage- 
ment, to live so that the expenses of one day balance 
those of the other — unless you are so happily situated 
that expense is a small matter, in which case these re- 
marks will not apply to you at all Then, never mind 
warming over, or making one Joint into two; let your 
poor neighbors and Bridget's friends enjoy your superflu- 
ity. To the woman with a moderate income it usually 
is a matter of importance, or ought to be, that her 
weekly expenditure should not exceed a certain amount, 
and for this she must arrange that any extra expense is 
balanced by a subsequent economy. 

Salads add much to the health and elegance of a din- 
ner ; it is in early spring an expensive item if lettuce is 
used; but no salad can be more delicious or more health- 
ful than dressed celery; and by buying when cheap, ar- 
ranging with a man to lay in yoiir cellar, covered with

soil, enough for tlie winter's use, it need cost but moder- 
ately. Celeraic, or turnip-rooted celery is another salad 
that is very popular with our German friends; it is a 
bulbous celery, the root being the part eaten ; these are 
cooked like potatoes, cut in slices, and dressed with oil 
and vinegar, or mayonnaise, it is exceedingly good. 
Potato salad is always procurable, and in summer at 
lunch, instead of the hot vegetable, or in winter when 
green salad is dear, is very valuable. It may be varied 
by the addition, one day, of a few chopped pickles, an- 
other, a little onion, or celery, or parsley, or tarragon, a 
little ravigotte butter beaten to cream with the vinegar, 
or with meat, as follows : Boil the potatoes in their skins, 
peel them, cut them into pieces twice the thickness 
of a fifty-cent piece, and put them into a salad bowl with 
cold meat (bouilli from soup is excellent) ; put to them 
a teaspoonful of salt, half that quantity of pepper, two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, three or even four of oil, and 
a teaspoonful of chopped parsley. You can vary this by 
putting at different times some chopped celery or pickles, 
olives, or anchovies. 



CHAPTEE VII. 

ON FETING AND BROILING. 

Feting is one of the operations in cookery in which 
there are more failures than any other, or, at least, there 
appear to be more, because the failure is always so yery 
apparent. Nothing can make a dish of breaded cutlets 
on which are bald white spots look inviting, or livid- 
looking fish, just flaked here and there with the bread 
that has been persuaded to stay on. And, provided you 
have enough fat in the pan— there should always be 
enough to immerse the article ; therefore use a deep iron 
or enameled pan — there can be but two reasons why you 
fail. Your fat has not been hot enough, or your crumbs 
have not been fine and even. 

Many suppose when the fat bubbles and boils in the 
pan that it is quite hot ; it is far from being so. Others 
again are so much nearer the truth that they know it 
must become silent, that is, boil and cease to boil, before 
it is ready, but even that is not enough; it must be silent 
some time, smoke, and appear to be on the point of burn- 
ing, then drop a bit of bread in; if it crisps and takes 
cfilor directly, quickly put in your articles. 

These articles, whether cutlets or fish, must have been 
carefully prepared, or herein may lie the second cause of 
failure. Any cookery book will give you directions how 
to crumb, follow them ; but what some do not tell you 
is, that your bread-crumbs should be finely sifted; every 

55 



56 Culture and Cooking. 

coarse crumb is liable to drop oif and bring -with it a 
good deal of the surrounding surface. 

I also follow the French plan in using the ^gg, and 
mix with it oil and water in the proportion of three 
eggs, one tablespoonful of oil, one of water, and a little 
salt, beat together and use. It is a good plan to keep a 
supply of fanure or dried bread-crumbs always ready. 
Cut any slices of baker's bread, dry them in a cool oven 
so that they remain quite colorless, or they will not do 
for the purpose. "When as dry as crackers, crush under 
a rolling-pin, and sift ; keep in a jar for use. 

In no branch of cooking is excellence more appreci- 
ated than in that of frying. A dish of filets de sole or 
cutlets, crisp and golden brown, is an ornament to any 
table, and is seldom disdained by any one. Apropos of 
filets de sole; it is very high-sounding yet very attainable, 
as I shall show. I was staying with a friend early in 
spring, a lady always anxious for table novelties. " Oh, 
do tell me what fish to order, I should like something 
fried, now that you are here to tell cook how to do it ; 
she hasn't the wildest idea, although she would be 
astounded to hear me say so." "Have you ever 
had flounders ?" I asked. " Flounders !" My friend's 
pretty nose went up the eighth of an inch, and her con- 
fidence in my powers as counselor went down to zero. 
" Flounders ! but they are a very common fish you 
know." "I know they are very delicious," I answered. 
" Order them, and trust me ; but I must coax the 
autocrat of your kitchen to allow me to cook and pre- 
pare them myself." 

An hour before dinner I went into the kitchen, put 
at least a pound of lard into a deep frying-pan, and 
set it where it would get gradually hot, then I turned 



On Frying and Broiling. 57 

my attention to the fish ; they -were thick, firm floun- 
ders, and were ready cleaned, scraped, and the heads 
off. I then proceeded to bone one in the following 
way : Take a sharp knife and split the flounder right 
down the middle of the back, then run the knife care- 
fully between the flesh and bones going toward the edge. 
You have now detached one quarter of the flesh from 
the bone, do the other half in the same way, and when 
the back is thus entirely loose from the bone, turn the 
fish over and do the same with the other part. You will 
now find you can remove the bone whole from the fish, 
detaching, as you do so, any flesh still retaining the 
bone, then you have two halves of the fish ; cut away 
the fins, and you have four quarters of solid fish. Now 
see if the fat is very hot, set it forward while you wipe 
your fish dry, and dip each piece in milk, then in flour. 
Try if the fat is hot by dropping a crumb into it ; if it 
browns at once, put in the fish. When they are beauti- 
fully brown, which will be in about ten minutes, take 
them up in the colander, and then lay them on a towel 
to absorb any fat, lay them on a hot dish, and garnish 
with slices of lemon and parsley or celery tops. 

Now when this dish made its appearance, my friend's 
husband, a Ion vivant, greeted it with, "Aha! Filets 
de sole d. la Delmonico," and as nothing to the con- 
trary was said until dinner was over, he ate them under 
the impression that they were veritable filets de sole. 
Of course I can't pretend to say whether M. Delmonico 
imports his soles, or uses the homely flounder ; but I do 
know that one of his frequenters knew no difference. 

Oysters should be laid on a cloth to drain thoroughly, 
then rolled in fine sifted cracker dust, and dropped into 
very hot fat; do not put more oysters in the pan than

will fry without one overlapping the - other. Very few 
minutes will brown them beautifully, if your fat was hot 
enough, and as a minute too long toughens and shrinks 
them, be very careful that it browns a cube of bread al- 
most directly, before you begin the oysters. Egg and 
bread-crumb may be used instead of cracker dust, but it 
is not the proper thing, and is a great deal more trouble. 
Should you be desirous of using it, however, the oysters 
must be carefully wiped dry before dipping them; while 
for cracker dust they are not wiped, but only drained 
well. 

Fish of any kind, fried in batter a la Careme (see 
recipe), is very easy to do, and very nice. 

Carefully save veal, lamb, beef, and pork drippings. 
Keep a crock to put it in, and, clarified as I shall direct, 
it is much better than lard for many purposes, and for 
frying especially ; it does not leave the dark look that is 
sometimes seen on articles fried in lard. The perfection 
of "friture,"' or frying-fat, according to GouSe, is equal 
parts of lard and beef fat melted together. 

Yet there are families where dripping is never used — 
is looked upon as unfit to use — while the truth is that 
many persons quite unable to eat articles fried in lard 
would find no inconvenience from those fried in beef fat. 
It is as wholesome as butter, and far better for the 
purpose. Butter, indeed, is only good for frying such 
things as omelets or scrambled eggs ; things that are 
cooked in a very short time, and require no great degree 
of heat. 

The same may be said of oil, than which, for fish, 
nothing can be better. Yet it can only be used once, 
and is unsuitable for things requiring long-sustained 
heat, as it soon gets bitter and rank. 



On Frying and Broiling. 59 

Do not be afraid to put a pound or two of fat in your 
pan for frying ; it is quite as economical as to put less 
for it can be used over and over again, a pail or crock 
being kept for tbe purpose of receiving it. Always in 
returning it to the crock pour it through a fine strainer, 
so that no sediment or brown particles may pass which 
would spoil the next frying. 

To clarify dripping, when poured from the meat-pan, 
it should go into a bowl, instead of the crock in which 
you wish to keep it. Then pour into the bowl also some 
boiling water, and add a little salt, stir it, and set it 
away. Next day, or when cold, run a knife round the 
bowl, and (unless it is pork) it will turn out in a solid 
cake, leaving the water and impurities at the bottom. 
Now scrape the bottom of your dripping, and put it in 
more boiling water till it melts, then stir again, another 
pinch of salt add, and let it cool again. When you take 
off the cake of fat, scrape it as before, and it is ready to 
be melted into the general crock, and will now keep for 
months in cool weather. If you are having frequent 
joints it is as well to do all your dripping together, once 
a week ; but do not leave it long at any season with wa- 
ter under it, as that would taint it. Fat skimmed from 
boiled meat, pot-au-feu, before the vegetables, etc., go 
in, is quite as good as that from roast, treated in the 
same way. 

Frying in batter is very easy and excellent for some 
things, such as warming over meat, being far better 
than eggs and crumbs. Careme gives the following 
recipe, which is excellent : 

Three quarters of a pound of sifted flour, mixed with 
two ounces of butter melted in warm water ; blow the 
butter off the water into the flour first, then enough of 



6o Culture and Cooking. 

the water to make a soft paste, -which beat smooth, then 
more warm water till it is batter thick enough to mask 
the back of a spoon dipped into it, and salt to taste ; add 
the la&t tiling the whites of two eggs well beaten. 

Another batter, called a la Provengale, is also exceed- 
ingly good, especially for articles a little dry in them- 
selves, such as chickens to be warmed OTcr, slices of cold 
Teal, etc. 

Take same quantity of flour, two yolks of eggs, four 
tablespoonfuls of oil, mix with cold water, and add 
whites of eggs and salt as before,^ Into this batter I 
sometimes put a little chopped parsley, and the least bit 
of powdered thyme, or grated lemon -peel, or nutmeg ; 
this is, howcTcr, only a matter of taste. 

Broiliitg is the simplest of all forms of cooking, and 
is essentially English. To broil well is very easy with 
a little attention. A brisk clear fire, not too high in 
the stove, is necessary to do it with ease ; yet if, as 
must sometimes happen, to meet the necessities of other 
cooking, your fire is very large, carefully fix the gridiron 
on two bricks or in any convenient manner, to prevent 
the meat scorching, then have the gridiron very hot be- 
fore putting your meat upon it ; turn it, if chop or 
steak, as soon as the gravy begins to start on the upper 
side ; if allowed to remain without turning long, the 
gravy forms a pool on the top, which, when turned, falls 
into the fire and is lost ; the action of the heat, if turned 
quickly, seals the pores and the gravy remains in the 
meat. If the fire is not very clear, put a cover over the 
meat on the gridiron, it will prevent its blackening or 
burning — if the article is thick I always do so — and it is 
an especially good plan with birds or chickens, which 
are apt to be raw at the joints unless this is done ; in- 



On Frying and Broiling. 6i 

deed, with the latter, I think it a good way to put them 
in a hot oven ten minutes before they go on to broil, 
then have a spoonful of mditre d'hotel butter to lay on 
the breast of each. Young spring chickens are some- 
times very dry, in which case dip them in melted but- 
ter, or, better still, oil them all over a little while be- 
fore cooking. There is nothing more unsightly than a 
sprawling dish of broiled chickens ; therefore, in prepar- 
ing them place them in good form, then, with a gentle 
blow of the rolling-pin, break the bones that they may 
remain so. 



CHAPTEK VIII. 

ROASTIN^G. 

In spite of Brillat-Savarin's maxim that one may be- 
come a cook, but must be born a rotisseur, I am inclined 
to tbink one may also, by remembering one or two 
things, become a very good "roaster" (to translate the 
untranslatable), especially in our day, when the oven has 
taken the place of the spit, although a great deal of 
meat is spoiled in roasting ; a loin of lamb or piece of 
beef, that comes to the table so pale that you can't tell 
whether it has been boiled or merely wilted in the oven, 
is an aggravation so familiar, that a rich brown, well- 
roasted Joint is generally a surprise. Perhaps the cook 
will tell you she has had the "hottest kind of an oven;" 
but then she has probably also had a well of water 
underneath it, the vapor from which, arising all the 
time, has effectually soddened the meat, and checked 
the browning. The surface of roast meat should be 
covered with a rich glaze, scientifically called " osma- 
zone." That the meat may be thus glazed, it should 
always go into a hot oven, so that, as the gravy exudes, 
it may congeal on the outside, thus sealing up the pores. 
The general plan, however, is to put meat into a warm 
oven an hour or two earlier than it should go, with a 
quantity of water and flour underneath it. The result in 
hot weather I have known to be very disagreeable, the 
tepid oven having, in fact, given a stale taste to the joint 

63 



Roasting. 63 

before it began to cook, and it at all times results in 
flavorless, tough meat. There is no time saved, either, 
in putting the meat in -while the oven is yet cool. Heat 
up the oven till it is quite brisk, then put the meat in a 
pan, in which, if it is fat, you require no water ; if very 
lean, you may put half a teacup, just enough to prevent 
the pan burning ; you may rub a little flour over the 
joint or not, as you please, but never more than the sur- 
face moisture absorbs ; have no clinging particles of 
flour upon the joint, neither put salt nor pepper upon 
the meat before it goes into the oven ; salt draws out the 
gravy, which it is your object to keep in, and the flavor 
of pepper is entirely changed by the parching it undergoes 
when on the surface of the meat, the odor of scorched 
pepper, while cooking, being very offensive to reflned 
nostrils. This does not occur when pepper is not on 
the surface ; for the inside of birds, in stuffing, and in 
meat pies it is indispensable, and the flavor undergoes 
no change. This remark on pepper applies also to 
broiling and frying. Always pepper after the article is 
cooked, and both for appearance and delicacy of flavor 
white pepper should always be used in preference to 
black. 

Meat, while in the oven, should be carefully turned 
about so that it may brown equally, and when it has 
been in half the time you intend to give it, or when the 
upper surface is well browned, turn it over. When it 
comes out of the oven put it on a hot dish, then care- 
fully pour off the fat by holding the corner of the meat 
pan over your dripping-pan, and very gently allowing 
the fat to run off ; do not shake it ; when you see the 
thick brown sediment beginning to run too, check it ; if 
there is still much fat on the surface, take it off with a 



64 Culture and Cooking. 

spoon ; then pour into the pan a little boiling water and 
salt, in quantity according to the quantity of sediment 
or glaze in the pan, and with a spoon rub ofE every speck 
of the dried gravy on the bottom and sides of the pan. 
Add no flour, the gravy must be thick enough with its 
own richness. If you have added too much water, so 
that it looks poor, you may always boil it down by set- 
ting the pan on the stove for a few minutes ; but it is 
better to put very little water at first, and add as the 
richness of the gravy allows. Now you have a rich 
brown gravy, instead of the thick whitey-brown broth 
so often served with roast meat. Every drop of this 
gravy and that from the dish should be carefully saved 
if left over. 

Save all dripping, except from mutton or meat with 
which onions are cooked, for purposes which I shall 
indicate in another place. 

Veal and pork require to be very thoroughly cooked. 
For them, therefore, the oven must not be too hot, nei- 
ther must it be lukewarm, a good even heat is best ; if 
likely to get too brown before it is thoroughly cooked, 
open the oven door. 



CHAPTEE IX. 

BOILING. 

BoiLiiTG is one of the things about which cooks are 
most careless ; theoretically they almost always know 
meat should be slowly boiled, but their idea of "slow " is 
ruled by the fire ; they never attempt to rule that. There 
is a good rule given by GoufEe as to what slow boiling 
actually is : the surface of the pot should only show 
signs of ebullition at one side, just an occasional bubble. 
Simmering is a still slower process, and in this the pot 
should have only a sizzling round one part of the edge. 
All fresh meat should boil slowly ; ham or corn beef 
should barely simmer. Yet they must not go off the 
boil at all, which would spoil fresh meat entirely ; steep- 
ing in water gives a flat, insipid taste. 

All vegetables except potatoes, asparagus, peas, and 
cauliflower should boil as fast as possible ; these four 
only moderately. Most vegetables are boiled far too long. 
Cabbage is as delicate as cauliflower in the summer and 
fall if boiled in plenty of water, to which a salt spoon- 
ful of soda has been added, as fast as possible for twenty 
minutes or half an hour, then drained and dressed. In 
winter it should be cut in six or eight pieces, boiled /asif, 
in plenty of water, for half an hour, no longer. Always 
give it plenty of room, let the water boil rapidly when 
you put it in the pot, which set on the hottest part of 

65 



66 Culture and Cooking. 

the fire to come to that point again, and you will have no 
more strong, rank, yellow stuff on your table, no bad odor 
in your house. Peas require no more than twenty minutes' 
boiling if young ; asparagus the same ; the latter should 
always be boiled in a saucepan deep enough to let it 
stand up in the water when tied up in bunches, for this 
saves the heads. Potatoes should be poured off the 
minute they are done, and allowed to stand at the back of 
the stove with a clean cloth folded over them. They are 
the only vegetable that should be put into cold water. 
When new, boiling water is proper. When quite ripe 
they are more floury if put in cold water. 

Soups. — As I have before said, I do not pretend to give 
many recipes, only to tell you hoAV to succeed with the 
recipes given in other books. I shall, therefore, only 
give one recipe which I know is a novelty and one for the 
foundation of all soups. 'In one sense I have done the 
latter already. The stock for glaze is an excellent soup 
before it is reduced ; but I will also give Jules Gouffe's 
method of making pot-au-feu, it being a most beautifully 
clear soup. 

It often happens, however, that you have suflBcient 
stock from bones, trimmings of meat, and odds and ends 
of gravies, which may always be turned to account ; bnt 
the stock from such a source, although excellent, will 
not always be clear ; therefore, you must proceed with it 
in the following manner, unless you wish to use it for 
thick soup : 

Make your stock boiling hot and skim well ; then have 
ready the whites of three eggs (I am supposing you 
have thi'ee quarts of stock — one etxs, to a quart), to which 
add half a pint of cold water ; wliisk well together ; then 
add half a pint of the boiling stock gradually, still whisk- 



Boiling. 67 

ing the eggs ; then stir the boiliug stock rapidly, pourin|^ 
in the whites of eggs, etc. ; as you do it, stir quickly till 
nearly boiling again, then take it from the fire, let it re- 
main till the whites of eggs separate ; then strain through 
a clean, fine cloth into a basin. This rule once learned 
will clear every kind of soup or jelly. 

There are many people who are good cooks, yet fail in 
clear soup, which is with them semi-opaque, while it 
should be like sherry. The cause of this opacity is gen- 
erally quick boiling while the meat is in. This gives it 
a milky appearance. After the stock is once made and 
clear, quick boiling will do no harm, but of course wastes 
the soup, unless resorted to for the purpose of making it 
stronger. A word hereabout coloring soup : Most per- 
sons resort to burnt sugar, and, very carefully used, it is 
not at all a bad makeshift. But how often have we a 
rich-looking soup put before us, the vermicelli appear- 
ing to repose under a lake of strong russet bouillon, but 
which, on tasting, we find suggestive of nothing but 
burnt sugar and salt, every bit of flavor destroyed by the 
acrid coloring. Sometimes stock made by the recipe for 
pot-au-feu (to follow) requires no color ; this depends 
on the beef ; but usually all soup is more appetizing in 
appearance for a little browning, and for this purpose I 
always use burnt onions in preference to anything else. 
If you have none in store when the soup is put on, put 
a small onion in the oven (or on the back of the stove ; 
should you be baking anything the odor would taint) ; 
turn it often till it gets quite black, but not charred. 
Then put it to the soup ; it adds a fine flavor as well as 
color, and you need not fear overdoing it. 

Soup that is to be reduced must be very lightly salted; 
for this reason salt is left out altogether for glaze, as the 



68 Culture and Cooking. 

reduction causes the water only to evaporate, the salt 
remains. 

Goui-fb's Pot-au-Feu. — Pour pounds of lean beef, 
six quarts of water, sis ounces of carrot, six of turnip, 
six of onion, half an ounce of celery, one clove, salt. 

Put the meat on in cold water, and just before it 
comes to the boil skim it, and throw in a wineglass of 
cold water, skim again, and, when it is " on the boil," 
again throw in another wineglass of cold water ; do this 
two or three times. The object of adding the cold water 
is to keep it just off the boil until all the scum has risen, 
as the boiling point is when it comes to the surface, yet 
once having boiled, the scum is broken up, and the soup 
is never so clear. 

The meat must simmer slowly, not hoil, for three 
hours before the vegetables are added, then for a couple 
of hours more. 

It is necessary to be very exact in the proportions of 
vegetables ; but, of course, after having weighed them for 
soups once or twice, you will get to know about the size 
of a carrot, turnip, etc., that will weigh six ounces. 
The exact weight is given until the eye is accustomed 
to it. 

This soup strained, and boiled down to one half, be- 
comes consomme. 

Celeet Ceeam is a most delicious and little-known 
white soup, and all lovers of good things will thank me 
for introducing it. 

Have some nice veal stock, or the water in which 
chickens have been boiled, reduced till it is rich enough, 
will do, or some very rich mutton broth, but either of 
the former are preferable ; then put on a half cup of rice 
in a pint of rich milk, and grate into it the white part 



Boiling. 69 

and root of two heads of celery. Let the rice milk cook 
very slowly at the back of the stove, adding more milk 
before it g^ts at all stiff ; when tender enough to mash 
through a coarse sieve or fine colander add it to the 
stock, which must have been strained and be quite 
free from sediment, season with salt and a little wMte 
pepper or cayennfe, boil all together gently a few min- 
utes. It should look like rich cream, and be strongly 
flavored with celery. Of course the quantity of rice, 
milk, and celery must depend on the quantity of stock 
you have. I have given the proportion for one quart, 
which, with the milk, etc., added, would make about 
three pints of soup. 



CHAPTER X. 

SAUCES. 

Talleyrand said England was a country -witli twen- 
ty-four religions and only one sauce. He might have 
said two sauces, and he would have been literally right 
as regards both England and America. Everything is 
served with brown sauce or white sauce. And how 
often the white sauce is like bookbinder's paste, the 
brown, a bitter, tasteless brown mess ! Strictly speak- 
ing, perhaps, the French have but two sauces either, 
espagnole, or brown sauce, and white sauce, which they 
call the mother sauces ; but what changes they ring on 
these mother sauces ! The espagnole once made, with no 
two meats is it served alike in flavor, and in this matter 
of flavor the artist appears. In making brown sauce for 
any purpose, bethink yourself of anything there may be 
in your store-room with which to vary its flavor, taking 
care that it shall agree with the meat for which it is in- 
tended. The ordinary cook flies at once to Worcester- 
shire or Harvey sauce, which are excellent at times, but 
" toujours 2^erdrix '' is not always welcome. A pinch of 
mushroom j)owdcr, or a few chopped oysters, are excel- 
lent with beef or veal ; so will be a spoonful of Jlontpel- 
lier butter stirred in, or curry, not enough to yellow the 
sauce, but enough to give a dash of piquancy. A pic- 
kled walnut chopped, or a gherkin or two, go admirably 
with mutton or pork chops. In short, this is Just where 

70 



Sauces. yi 

imagination and brains will tell in cooking, and little 
essays of invention may be tried with profit. But be- 
ware of trying too much ; make yourself perfect in one 
thing before venturing on another. 

EsPAGNOLE, or brown sauce, is simply a rich stock well 
flavored with vegetables and herbs, and thickened with 
a piece of roux or with brown flour. 

White Sauce is one of those things we rarely find per- 
fectly made ; bad, it is the ne plus ultra of badness ; 
good, it is delicious. Those who have tried to have it 
good, and failed, I beg to try the following method of 
making it : Take an ounce and a half of butter and a 
scant tablespoonful of flour, mix both with a spoon into a 
paste ; when smooth add half a pint of warm milk, a small 
teaspoonful of salt, and the sixth part of one of white pep- 
per ; set it on the fire till it boils, and is thick enough 
to mask the back of the spoon transparently ; then add a 
squeeze of lemon juice, and another ounce and a half of 
fresh butter ; stir this till quite blended. This sauce is 
the foundation for many others, and, for some purposes, 
the beaten yolk of an egg is introduced when just off 
the boil. Capers may be added to it, or chopped mush- 
rooms, or chopped celery, or oysters, according to the 
use for which it is intended. The object of adding the 
second butter is because boiling takes away the flavor of 
butter ; by stirring half of it in, without boiling, you re- 
tain it. 



CHAPTEE XI. 

WAEMING OVER. 

Hash is a peculiarly American institution. In no 
other country is eyery remnant of cold meat turned into 
that one unvarying dish. What do I say ? remnants of 
cold meat ! rather joints of cold meat, a roast of heef 
of vhioh the tenderloin had sufficed for the first day's 
dinner, the leg of mutton from which a few slices only 
have been taken, the fillet of veal, available for so many 
delicate dishes, all are ruthlessly turned into ,the all- 
pervading hash. The curious thing is that people are 
not fond of it. Men exclaim against it, and its name 
stinks in the nostrils of those unhappy ones whose home 
is the boarding-house. 

Yet hash in itself is not a bad dish ; when I say it is 
a peculiarly American institution, I mean, that when 
English people speak of hash, they mean something 
quite different — meat warmed in slices. Our hash, in 
its best form — that is, made with nice gravy, garnished 
with sippets of toast and pickles, surrounded with 
mashed potatoes or rice — is dignified abroad by the name 
of mince, and makes its appearance as an elegant little 
entree. Nor would it be anathematized in the way it 
is with us, if it were only occasionally introduced. It 
is the familiarity that has led to contempt. "But 
what shall I do ? " asks the young wife distressfully ; 

73 



Warming Over. 73 

" John likes joints, and he and I and Bridget can't pos- 
sibly eat a roast at a meal." 

Very true ; and it is to Just ' such perplexed young 
housekeepers that I hope this chapter will be especially 
useful — that is to say, small families with moderate 
means and a taste for good things. In this, as in many 
other ways, large families are easier to cater for ; they 
can consume the better part of a roast at a meal, and 
the remains it is no great harm to turn into hash, al- 
though even they might, with little trouble and expense, 
have agreeable variety introduced into their bill of fare. 

In England and America there is great prejudice 
against warmed-over food, but on the continent one eats 
it half the time in some of the most delicious-made 
dishes without suspecting it. Herein lies the secret. 
"With us and our transatlantic cousins the warming over 
is so artlessly done, that the hard fact too often stares 
at us from out the watery expanse in which it reposes. 

One great reason of the failure to make warmed-over 
meat satisfactory is the lack of gravy. On the goodness 
of this (as well as "its presence) depends the success of 
your rechauffe. 

The glaze, for which I have given the recipe, renders 
you at all times independent in this respect, but at the 
same time it should not alone be depended on. Every 
drop of what rema-ins in the dish from the roast should 
be saved, and great care be taken of all scraps, bones, 
and gristle, which should be carefully boiled down to 
save the necessity of flying to the glaze for every pur- 
pose. I will here give several recipes, which I think 
may be new to many readers. 

Salmi oj? Cold Meat is exceedingly good. Melt butter 
in a saucepan, if for quite a small dish two ounces will

74 Culture and Cooking. 

be sufficient ; when melted, stir in a little flour to 
thicken ; let it brown, but not burn, or, if you are pre- 
paring the dish in haste, put in some brown flour ; then 
add a glass of white or red wine and a cup of broth, or a 
cup of water and a slice of glaze, a sprig or two of 
thyme, parsley, a small onion, chopped, and one bay 
leaf, pepper, and salt. Simmer all thoroughly (all 
savory dishes to which wine is added should simmer 
long enough for the distinct "winey" flavor to disap- 
pear, only the strength and richness remaining). Strain 
this when simmered half an hour and lay in the cold 
meat. Squeeze in a little lemon Juice and draw the 
stew-pan to the back of the stove, but where it will cook 
no longer, or the meat will harden. Serve on toast, and 
pour the sauce over. A glass of brandy added to this 
dish when the meat goes in is a great addition, if an 
extra flne salmi is desired. By not allowing the flour 
and butter to brown and using white wine, this is a very 
fine sauce in which to warm cold chicken, veal, or any 
wliite meat. 

BcEUF A LA Jardiniere. —Put in a fireproof dish if 
you have it, or a thick saucepan, a pint of beef broth, a 
small bunch each of parsley, chervil, tarragon — very lit- 
tle of this — shallot or onion, capers, pickled gherkins, 
of each or any a teaspoonful chopped fine ; roll a large 
tablespoonful of butter with a dessert-spoonful of brown 
flour, stir it in ; then take slices of underdone beef, with 
a blunt knife hack eacli slice all over in fine dice, but 
not to sei^arate or cut up the slices ; then pepper and 
salt each one and lay it in with the herbs, sprinkle a 
]a3'er of herbs over the beef and cover closely ; then stand 
the dish in the oven to slowly cook for an hour, or, if 
you use a stew-pan, set in a pan of boiling water on the 



Warming Over. 75 

stove for an hour where the water will/ just hoil. Serve 
on a dish surrounded with young carrots and turnips if 
in season, or old ones cut. 

Beef au Geatik. — Cut a little fat bacon or pork very 
thin, sprinkle on it chopped parsley, onion, and mush- 
, rooms (mushroom powder will do) and bread-crumbs ; 
then put in layers of beef, cut thick, and well and closely 
hacked, then another layer of bacon or pork cut thin as 
a wafer, and of seasoning, crumbs last ; pour over enough 
broth or gravy to moisten well, in which a little brandy 
or wine may be added if an especially good dish is 
desired ; bake slowly an hour. 

PsEUDO Beefsteak. — Cut cold boiled or roast beef in 
thick slices, broil slowly, lay in a hot dish in which you 
have a large spoonful of Montpellier butter melted, 
sprinkle a little mushroom powder if you desire, and 
garnish with fried potato. 

Cutlets a la Jaedinibke. — Trim some thick cutlets 
from a cold leg of mutton, or chops from the loin, dip 
them in frying batter, a la Car erne, fry crisp and quickly, 
and serve wreathed round green peas, or a ragout made as 
follows : Take young carrots, turnips, green peas, white 
beans ; stew gently in a little water to which the bones 
of the meat and trimmings have been added (and which 
must be carefully removed not to disfigure the vegeta- 
bles). Encircle this ragout with the fried cutlebs, and 
crown with a cauliflower. 

Ceomesquis of lamb is a Polish recipe. Cut some 
underdone lamb— mutton will of course do— quite small ; 
also some mushrooms, cut small, or the powder. Put in 
a saucepan apiece of glaze the size of a pigeon's egg, with 
a little water or broth, warm it and thicken with yolks 
of two eggs, just as you would make boiled custard, that

is, without letting it come to the boil, or it will curdle; 
then add the mushrooms and meat, let all get cold, and 
divide it into small pieces, roll in bread-crumbs sifted, 
then in egg, then in crumbs again, and fry in very hot 
fat; or you may, afUr rolling in bread-crumbs, lay each 
piece in a spoon and dip it into frying batter ; let the 
extra batter run off, and drop the cromesquis into the 
hot fat. These will be good made of beef and rolled up 
in a bard of fat pork cut thin, and fried; serve with sauce 
piquant made thus : Take some chopped parsley, onion, 
and pickled cucumbers, simmer till tender, and thicken 
with an equal quantity of butter and flour. Of course 
your own brightness will tell you that, if you are in 
haste, a spoonful of Montpellier butter, the same of flour, 
melted in a little water, to which you add a teaspoonful 
of vinegar, will make an excellent sauce piquant, and 
this same is excellent for anything fried, as breaded 
chops, croquettes, etc. I may here say, that where two 
or three herbs are mentioned as necessary, for instance, 
parsley, tarragon, and chervil, if you have no tarragon 
you must leave it out, or chervil the same. It is only a 
matter of flavoring, at the same time flavor is a great 
deal, and these French herbs give that indescribable 
cachet to a dish which is one of the secrets of French 
cooking. Therefore if you are a wise matron you will 
have a supply on hand, even if only bought dry from the 
druggist. 

MiEOTO]sr OF Beef. — Peel and cut into thin slices two 
large onions, put them in a stew-pan with two ounces of 
butter, place it over a slow fire ; stir the onions round till 
they are rather brown, but not in the least burnt ; add a 
teaspoonful of brown flour, mix smoothly, then moisten 
with half a pint of broth, or water with a little piece of 



Warming Over, yy 

glaze, three salt-spoonfuls of salt unless your broth was 
salted, then half the quantity or less, two of sugar, and 
one of pepper. Put in the cold beef, cut in thin slices 
as lean as possible, let it remain five minutes at the back 
of the stoTe ; then serye on a very hot dish garnished 
with fried potatoes, or sippets of toast. To vary the 
flavor, sometimes put a spoonful of tarragon or plain 
vinegar, or a teaspoonful of mushroom powder, or a 
pinch of curry, unless objected to, or a few sweet herbs. 
In fact, as you may see, variety is as easy to produce as 
it is rare to meet with in average cooking, and depends 
more on intelligence and thoughtfulness than on any- 
thing else. 

The simplest of all ways of warming a joint that is 
not far cut, is to wrap it in thickly buttered paper, and 
put it in the oven again, contriving, if possible, to cover 
it closely, let it remain long enough to get hot through, 
not to cook. By keeping it closely covered it will get 
hot through in less time, and the steam will prevent it 
getting hard and dry ; make some gravy hot and serve 
with the meat. If your gravy is good and plentiful, 
your meat will be as nice as the first day; without gravy 
it would be an unsatisfactory dish. If you cannot 
manage to cover the joint in the oven, you may put it in 
a pot over the fire without water, but with a dessert 
spoonful of vinegar to create steam ; let it get hot 
through, and serve as before. 

For the third day the meat may be warmed up in 
any of the ways I am going to mention, repeating once 
more, that you must have gravy of some kind, or else 
carefully make some, with cracked bones, gristle, etc., 
stewed long, and nicely flavored with any kind of 
sauce. 



78 Culture and Cooking. 

Eagout. — A very nice ragout may be made from cold 
meat thus : Slice the meat, put it in a stew-pan in which 
an onion, or several if you like them, has been sliced; 
squeeze half a lemon into it, or a dessert-spoonful of vine- 
gar, cover closely without water, and when it begins to 
cook, set the stew-pan at the back of the stove for three 
quarters of an hour, shaking it occasionally. The onions 
should now be brown; take out the meat, dredge in a little 
flour, stir it round, and add a cup of gravy, pepper, salt, 
and a small quantity of any sauce or flavoring you prefer; 
stew gently a minute or two, then put the meat back to 
get hot, and serve ; garnish with sippets of toast, or 
pickles. 

A NICE LITTLE BREAKFAST DISH is made thus : Out 
two long slices of cold meat and three of bread, buttered 
thickly, about the same shape and size ; season the meat 
with pepper, salt, and a little finely chopped parsley; or, 
if it is veal, a little chopped ham ; then lay one slice of 
bread between two of meat, and have the other two slices 
outside ; fasten together with short wooden skewers. If 
you have a quick oven, put it in ; and take care to baste 
with butter thoroughly, that the bread may be all over 
crisp and brown. If you can't depend on your oven, fry 
it in very hot fat as you would crullers ; garnish with 
sprigs of parsley, and serve very hot. 

To Waem a Good-sized Piece oe Beef.— Trim 
it as much like a thick fillet as you can ; cut it 
horizontally half way through, then scoop out as much 
as you can of the meat from the inside of each piece. 
Chop the meat fine that you have thus scooped out, 
season with a little finely chopped parsley and thyme, a 
shred of onion, if you like it; or if you have celery boil 
a little of the coarser part till tender, chop it and add 



Warming Over. 79 

as much bread finely crumbled as you have meat, and a 
good piece of butter ; add pepper and salt, and make all 
into a paste with an egg, mixed with an equal quantity 
of gravy or milk ; fill up the hollow in the meat and tie, 
or still better, sew it together. You may either put this 
in a pot with a slice of pork or bacon, and a cup of 
gravy; or you may brush it over with beaten &gg, cover 
it with crumbs, and pour over these a cup of butter, 
melted, so that it moistens every part; and bake it, taking 
care to baste well while baking ; serve with mce gravy. 

Beef Olives are no novelty to the ear, but it is a 
novel thing to find them satisfactory to the palate. 

Take some stale bread-crumbs, an equal quantity of 
beef finely chopped, some parsley, and thyme ; a little 
scraped ham if you have it, a few chives, or a slice of 
onion, all chopped small as possible ; put some butter in 
a pan, and let this force-meat Just simmer, not fry, in it 
for ten minutes. While this is cooking, cut some un- 
derdone oblong slices of beef about half an inch thick, 
hack it with a sharp knife on loth sides ; then mix the 
cooked force-meat with the yolk of an egg and a table- 
spoonful of gravy ; put a spoonful of this paste in the 
center of each slice of meat and tie it up carefully in the 
shape of an egg. Then if you have some nice gravy, 
thicken it with a piece of butter rolled in flour, roll each 
olive slightly in flour and lay it in the gravy and let it 
very gently simmer for half an hour. A few chopped 
oysters added to the gravy will be a great addition. Or 
you may lay each olive on a thin slice of fat pork, roll it 
up, tie it, dip it in flour, and bake in a quick oven until 
beautifully brown. 

To "Warm ovee Cold Mutton. — An excellent and 
simple way is to cut it, if loin, into chops, or leg, into 



So Culture and Cooking. 

Ihict collops, and dip each into egg well beaten with a 
tablespoonful of milk, then mfine bread-crumbs and fry 
in plenty of very hot fat. 

If your crumbs are not very fine and CTen, the larger 
crumbs will fall off, and the appearance be spoilt. 
These cliops will be almost as nice, if quickly fried, as 
fresh cooked ones. They will also be excellent if, instead 
of being breaded, they are dipped into thick batter (see 
recipe) and fried brown in the same way. This method 
answers lor any kind of meat, chicken thus warmed oVer 
being especially good. The batter, or egg and bread- 
crumbs form a sort of crust which keeps it tender and 
juicy. Any attempt to fry cold meat without either re- 
sults in a hard, stringy, uneatable dish. 

White Meat oe xisy kind is excellent warmed over 
in a little milk, in which you have cut a large 
onion, and, if you like it, a slice of salt pork or 
ham, and a little sliced cucumber, if it is summer; 
thicken with the yolks of one or two eggs, added 
after the whole has simmered twenty minutes ; take 
care the egg thickens in the gravy, but does not loil, 
or it will curdle. If it is in winter, chop a teaspoonful of 
pickled cucumber or capers and add just on going to 
table. In summer when you have the sliced cucumber, 
squeeze half a lemon into the gravy, the last thing, to 
give the requisite dash of acid. You may vary the above 
by adding sometimes a few chopped oysters ; at others, 
mushrooms, or celery. The last must be put in with 
the onion and before the meat. 

Deviled Meat. — Our better halves are usually fond 
of this, especially for breakfast or lunch. 

For this dish take a pair of turkey or chicken drumsticks 
or some nice thick wedges of underdone beef or mutton, 



Warming Over. 8i 

score them deeply -with a knife and rub them oyer with 
a sauce made thus: A teaspoonful of Tinegar, the same 
of Harvey or "Worcestershire sauce, the same of mustard, 
a little cayenne, and a tablespoonful of salad oil, or but- 
ter melted ; mis all till like cream, and take care your 
meat is thoroughly moistened all over with the mixture, 
then rub your gridiron with butter. See that the fire is 
clear, and while the gridiron is getting hot, chop a tea- 
spoonful of parsley very fine, mix it up with a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut, and lay this in a dish which 
you will put to get hot. Then put the meat to be grilled 
on the fire and turn often, so that it will not burn; when 
hot through and brown, lay it in the hot dish, lay an- 
other hot dish over it, and serve as quickly as possible 
with hot plates. 

Or the grill may be served with what Soyer calls his 
Mephistoplielian sauce, which he especially designed for 
serving with deviled meats. Chop six shallots or small 
onions, wash and press them in the corner of a clean 
cloth, put them in a stew-pan with half a wineglass of 
chili vinegar (pepper sauce), a chopped clove, a tiny bit 
of garlic, two bay leaves, an ounce of glaze; boil all to- 
gether ten minutes ; then add four tablespoonfuls of 
tomato sauce, a little sugar, and ten of broth tliickened 
with roux (or water will do if you have no broth). 

It will be remarked that in many French recipes a 
little sugar is ordered. This is not meant to sweeten, or 
even be perceptible; but it enriches, softens, tones, as it 
were, the other ingredients as salt does. 

Soter's Feitadella (twenty recipes in one).— Put

water; take the same quantity of any kind of roast, or

bread in a clean doth to extract the water ; put in a 
stew-pan two ounces of butter, a tablespoonful of chopped 
onions ; fry two minutes and stir, then add the bread, 
stir and fry till rather dry, then the meat ; season with a 
teaspoonf ul of salt, half of pepper, and a little grated nut- 
meg, and lemon peel; stir continually till very hot, then 
add two eggs, one at a time; mix well and pour on a dish 
to get cold. Then take a piece, shape it like a small egg, 
flatten it a little, egg and bread-crumb it all over, tak- 
ing care to keep in good shape. Do all the same way, 
then put into a frying-pan a quarter of a pound of lard 
or dripping, let it get hot, and put in the pieces, and 
saute (or as we call it "fry") them a fine yellow brown. 
Serve very hot with a border of mashed potatoes, or any 
garniture you fancy. Sauce piquant, or not, as you 
please. 

The above can be made with any kind of meat, poul- 
try, game, fish, or even vegetables; hard eggs, or potatoes, 
may be introduced in small quantities, and they may be 
fried instead of sauteed (frying in the French and strict 
sense, meaning as I need hardly say, entire immersion in 
very hot fat). To fry them you require at least two 
pounds of fat in your pan. 

Oysters or lobsters prepared as above are excellent. 

Boileau says, " Un diner rechauffe ne valid jamais 
rien." But I think a good French cook of the present 
day would make him alter his opinion. 

Indeed Savarin quotes a friend of his own, a notable 
gourmand, who considered spinach cooked on Monday 
only reached perfection the following Saturday, having 
each day of the week been warmed up with butter, and 
each day gaining succulence and a more marrowy consist- 
ency. 



Warming Over. 83 

The only trouble I find in relation to this part of my 
present task is the difBculty of knowing when to leave 
off. There are so many ways of warming meats to ad- 
vantage—and in every one way there is the suggestion 
for another — that I sufEer from an emlarras de richesse, 
and have had difficulty in selecting. Dozens come to my 
mind, blanquettes, patties, curries, as I write; but as 
this is not, I have said, to be a recipe book, I forbear. Of 
one thing I am quite sure : when women once know how to 
make nice dishes of cold meat they will live well where 
they now live badly, and for less money; and "hash" will 
be relegated to its proper place as an occasional and ac- 
ceptable dish. 



CHAPTEE XII. 

ON EEIANDISBS. 

" Le role du gourmand finit avec I'entremets, et celui du fiiand 
commence au dessert. — Orimod de. la Reyniere. 

Ameeican ladies, as a rule, excel in cake making and 
preserving, and I feel that on that head I have very little 
to teach ; indeed, were they as accomplished in all 
branches of cooking as in making dainty sweet dishes 
this book would be uncalled for. 

Yet, notwithstanding their undoubted taste and ability 
in making " friandises," it seems to me a few recipes 
borrowed from what the French call la grande cuisine, 
and possible of execution at home, will be welcome to 
those who wish to vary the eternal ice cream and char- 
lotte russe, with other sweets more elegant and likely to 
be equally popular. 

Iced Souffle a la Byeoht. — One pint of sugar 
syrup of 33 degrees (get this at a druggist's if 
you do not understand sugar boiling), three gills of 
strained raspberry juice, one lemon, one gill of maras- 
chino, fifteen yolks of eggs, two ounces of chocolate 
drops, half a pint of very thick cream whipped. 

Method of making this and the next recipe is as follows: 
Mix the syrup and yolks of eggs, strain into a warm 
bowl, add the raspberry and lemon juice and maras- 
chino, whisk till it creams well, then take the bowl out 

84

of the hot vater and "whisk ten minutes longer ; add the 
chocolate drops and whipped cream ; lightly fill a case 
or mold, and set in a freezer for two hours, then coyer 
the surface with lady-fingers (or sponge cake) dried in 
the oven a pale brown, and rolled. Serve at once. 

Another frozen souffle, is as follows : 

One pint of syrup, 33 degrees, half a pint of noyeau, 
half a pint of cherry juice, two ounces of bruised 
macaroons, half a pint of thick cream whipped, made in 
the same way as the last. I may here say that the fruit 
juices can be procured now at all good druggists, so that 
these souffles are very attainable in winter, and as noy- 
eau and maraschino do not form part of the stores in a 
family of small means, I will give in this chapter recipes 
for the making of very fair imitations of the genuine 
liqueurs. 

Biscuit Glace a la Chaeles Dickens. — One pint 
of syrup (32°), fifteen yolks of eggs, three gills of peach 
pulp, colored pink with cochineal, one gill of noyeau, 
half a pint of thick cream, and a little chocolate water- 
ice, made with half a pint of syrup and four ounces of 
the best chocolate smoothly mixed and frozen ready. 

Mix syrup, yolks, peach pulps, noyeau, and a few 
drops of vanilla, whip high ; mix with the whipped 
cream, and set in ice for one hour and a half in brick- 
shaped molds, then turn out (if very firm), and cut in 
slices an inch thick, and coat them all over, or on top 
and sides, with the chocolate ice, smoothing with a knife 
dipped in cold water ; serve in paper cases. 

Biscuit Glace a la Thackeeat. — One pint of syrup 
(32°), one pint of strawberry pulp, fifteen yolks of eggs, 
one ounce of vanilla sugar (flavor a little sugar with va- 
nilla), half a pint of thick cream. 



86 Culture and Cooking. 

Mix syrup, yolks, strawberry, and vanilla sugar, wliip- 
ping as before, then add the whipped cream lightly ; fill 
paper cases, either round or square j surround each with 
a band of stiii paper, to reach half an inch above the 
edge of the case, the bands to be pinned together to se- 
cure them ; place them in a freezer. When about to send 
to table, remove the bands of paper, and cover with 
macaroons bruised fine and browned in the oven.' The 
bands of paper are meant to give the biscuit the appear- 
ance of having risen while supposed to bake. 

These delicious ices were invented by Francatelli, the 
Queen of England's chief cook, to do homage to the 
different great men whose names they bear, on the occa- 
sion of preparing dinners given in their honor. They 
read as if somewhat intricate, but any lady who has ever 
had ice cream made at home, and had the patience to 
make charlotte russe, need not shrink appalled before 
these novelties, or fear for a successful result. 

Baba is a cake many call for at a confectioner's, yet 
few, if any one, attempts to make it at home. That 
the recipes generally offered do not lead to success may be 
one reason, and I offer the following, quite sure, if ac- 
curately followed, such a baba will result as never was 
eaten outside of Paris. 

Baba. — One pound of flour ; take one quarter of it, 
and make a sponge with half an ounce of compressed 
yeast and a little warm water, set it to rise, make a hole 
in the rest of the fiour, add to it ten ounces of butter, 
three eggs, and a dessert-spoonful of sugar, a little salt, 
unless your butter salts it enough, which is generally 
the case. Eeat all together well, then add five more eggs, 
one at a time, that is to say, add one ^gg and beat well, 
then another and beat again, and so on until the five are 



On Friandises. 8/ 

used. When the paste leaves the bo-wl it is beaten 
enough, but not before ; then add the sponge to it, and 
a large half ounce of citron chopped, the same of cur- 
rants, and an ounce and a half of sultana raisins, seed- 
less. Let it rise to twice its size, then bake it in an oven 
of dark yellow paper heat ; the small round babas are an 
innovation of the pastry-cook to enable him to sell them 
uncut. But the baba proper should be baked in a large, 
deep, upright tin, such as a large charlotte russe mold, 
when they keep for several days fresh, and if they get 
stale, make delicious fritters, soaked in sherry and 
dipped in frying batter. 

In some cases, however, it may be preferred to make 
them as usually seen at French pastry cooks ; for this 
purpose you require a dozen small-sized round char- 
lotte russe molds, which fill half full only, as they 
rise very much ; bake these in a hotter oven, light brown 
paper heat; try with a twig as you would any other cake, 
if it comes out dry it is done ; then prepare a syrup as 
follows : Boil half pound of sugar in a pint of water, add 
to this the third of a pint of rum, and some apricot 
pulp — peach will of course do — and boil all together a 
few minutes ; pour this half an inch deep in a dish, and 
stand the cake or cakes in it ; it should drink up all the 
syrup, you may also sprinkle some over it. If any syrup 
remains, use it to warm over your cake when stale, 
instead of the sherry. 

Baba was introduced into France by Stanislas Lec- 
zinski, king of Poland, and the father-in-law of Louis 
XIV. ; and his Polish royal descendants still use with 
it, says Car^me, a syrup made o£ Malaga wine and 
one sixth part of eau de tanaisie. 

But, although our forefathers seemed to have relished 



88 Culture and Cooking. 

tansy very much, to judge from old recipe books, I 

doubt if such flaToring would be appreciated in our 
time. 

Satarins — commonly called wine cake by New York 
pastry cooks — are made as follows : 

One pound of flour, of which take one quarter to make 
a sponge, usinghalf an ounce of German compressed yeast, 
and a little warm milk ; when it has risen to twice its 
bulk, add one gill of hot milk, two eggs, and the rest of 
the flour ; mix well ; then add one more egg and beat, 
another, still beating; then add three quarters of a 
pound of fresh butter, a quarter of an ounce of salt, half 
an ounce of sugar, and half a gill of hot milk, beat well; 
then add eggs, one at a time, beating continually, until 
you have used five more. Cut in small dice three ounces 
of candied orange peel; butter a tin, which should be deep 
and straight-sided — a tin pudding boiler is not a bad 
thing — and sprinkle with chopped almonds. Fill the 
mold half full, and when risen to twice its bulk, bake in 
a moderate oven, dark yellow paper heat. "When served, 
this cake should stand in a dish of ayrup, flavored with 
rum, as for baba, or with sherry wine. 

BoucHEES DES Dames, a very ornamental and delicious 
little French cake, is sufficiently novel to deserve a place 
here, I think. Make any nice drop cake batter (either 
sponge, or sponge with a little butter in it I prefer) ; drop 
one on buttered paper and bake ; if it runs, beat in a 
littU more flour and sugar, but not much, or your cakes 
will be brittle ; they should be the size, when done, of a 
fifty-cent piece, and I find half a teaspoonf ul of batter 
dropped generally makes them about right. Have a 
tin cutter or tin box lid, if you have no cutter so small, 
about the size, and with it trim each cake when baked ; 



On Friandises. 89 

then take half the number and spread some with a yery 
thin layer of red currant jelly, others with peach or 
raspberry ; then on each so spread put a cake that is 
unspread, thus making a tiny sandwich or jelly cake. 
11 you have different sorts of jelly, put each separate, as 
you must adapt the flavor of your icing to the jelly. 
For red currant, ice with chocolate icing. Eecipes for 
icing are so general that I refer you to your cookery 
book. Those with peach may have white icing, flavored 
with almond, or with rum, beating in a little more 
sugar if the flavoring dilutes your icing too much. Al- 
mond flavoring goes well with raspberry. Cakes with 
raspberry jelly or jam should be iced pink, coloring the 
icing with prepared cochineal or cranberry juice. Thus 
you have your cakes brown, pink, and white, which look 
very pretty mixed. 

The process of icing is difficult to do after they are put 
together, but they are much handsomer this way, and 
keep longer. You require, to accomplish it, a good 
quantity of each kind of icing, and a number of little 
wooden skewers ; stick one into each cake and dip it 
in the icing, let it run oft", then stand the other end of 
the skewer in a box of sand or granulated sugar. The 
easiest way is to ice each half cake before putting in 
the jelly ; when the icing is hard spread with jelly, and 
put together. 

OUEA90A may be successfully imitated by pouring over 
eight ounces of the thinly pared rind of very ripe 
oranges a pint of boiling water, cover, and let it cool ; 
then add two quarts of brandy, or strong French spirit, 
cover closely, and let it stand fourteen days, shaking it 
every day. Make a clarified syrup of two pounds of 
sugar into one pint of water, well boiled ; strain the

brandy into it, leaying it covered close another day. 
Eub up in a mortar one drachm of potash, with a 
teaspoonful of the liqueurs ; when well blended, put this 
into the liqueur, and in the same way pound and add 
a drachm of alum, shake well, and in an hour or two 
filter through thin muslin. Eeady for use in a week or 
two. 

Maeaschino . — Bruise slightly a dozen cherry kernels, 
put them in a deep jar with the outer rind of three or- 
anges and two lemons, coyer with two quarts of gin, then 
add syrup and leave it a fortnight, as for cura9oa. Stir 
syrup and spirit together, leave it another day, run it 
through a jelly bag, and bottle. Eeady to use in ten 
days. 

NoTEATJ. — Blanch and pound two pounds of bitter al- 
monds, or four of peach kernels ; put to them a gallon of 
spirit or brandy, two pounds of white sugar candy — or 
sugar will do— a grated nutmeg, and a pod of vanilla ; 
leave it three weeks covered close, then filter and bottle ; 
but do not use it for three months. To be used with 
caution. 



CHAPTEE XIII. 

PRBNCH CANDY AT HOME. 

This chapter I shall have to make one of recipes 
chiefly, 'for it treats of a branch of cooking not usually 
found in cookery books, or at least there is seldom any- 
thing on the art of confectionery beyond molasses or 
cream taffy and nougat. These, therefore, I shall not 
touch upon, but rather show you how to make the ex- 
pensiTC French candies. 

The great art of making these exquisite candies is in 
boiling the sugar, and it is an art easily acquired with 
patience. 

Put into a marbleized saucepan (by long experience in 
sugar-boiling I find them less likely to burn even than 
brass, and I keep one for the purpose) one pound of 
sugar and half a pint of water ; when it has boiled ten 
minutes begin to try it ; have a bowl of water with a 
piece of ice near you, and drop it from the end of a 
spoon. When it falls to the bottom, and you can take it 
up and make it into a softish ball (not at all sticky) be- 
tween your thumb and finger, it is at the right point ; 
remove it from the fire to a cold place ; when cool, if 
perfectly right, a thin jelly-like film will be over the 
surface, not a sugary one ; if it is sugary, and you want 
your candy very creamy, you must add a few spoonfuls 
of water, return to the fire and boil again, going through 

91 



92 Culture and Cooking. 

the same process of trying it. You must be careful that 
there is not the least inclination to be brittle in ihe ball 
of candy you take from the water ; if so, it is boiled a 
degree too high ; put a little water to bring it back again, 
and try once more. A speck of cream of tartar is use- 
ful in checking a tendency in the syrap to go to sugar. 
When you have your sugar boiled just right set it to 
cool, and when you can bear your finger in it, begin to 
beat it with a spoon ; in ten minutes it will be a white 
paste resembling lard, which you will find you can work 
like bread dough. This, then, is your foundation, 
called by French confectioners fondant ; with your /om- 
dant you can work marvels. But to begin with the 
simplest French candies. 

Take a piece of fondant, flavor part of it with vanilla, 
part of it with lemon, color yellow (see coloring can- 
dies), and another part with raspberry, color pink ; make 
these into balls, grooved cones, or anything that strikes 
your fancy, let them stand till they harden, they are 
then ready for use. 

Take another part of youT fondant, have some English 
Ai'alnuts chopped, flavor with vanilla and color pink ; 
work the walnuts into the paste as you would fruit into 
a loaf cake ; when mixed, make a paper case an inch 
wide and deep, and three or four inches long ; oil it ; 
press the paste into it, and when firm turn it out and cut 
into cubes. Or, instead of walnuts, use chopped al- 
monds, flavor with vanilla, and leave ilne fondant white. 
This makes Vaxilla Alm:oh"d Ceeam. 

TuTTi FiiUTTi Candy.— Chop some almonds, citron, 
a few currants, and seedless raisins ; work into some 
fondant, flavor with rum and lemon, thus making Eo- 
man punch, or with vanilla or raspberry ; press into the 



French Candy at Home. 93 

paper forms as you did the walnut creain. You see how 
you can ring the changes on these bars, yarying the 
flaToring, inventing new combinations, etc. 

Fondant Panache. — Take jom fondant, divide it in 
three equal parts, color one pink and flavor as you choose, 
leave tlie other white and flavor also as you please ; 
but it must agree with the pink, and both must agree 
with the next, which is chocolate. Melt a little un- 
sweetened chocolate by setting it in a saucer over the 
boiling kettle, then take enough of it to make your third" 
piece of fondant a fine brown ; now divide the white 
into two parts ; make each an inch and a half wide, and 
as long as it will ; do the game with the chocolate fon- 
dant ; then take the pink, make it the same width and 
length, but of course, not being divided, it will be twice 
as thick ; now butter slightly the back of a plate, or, 
better still, get a few sheets of waxed paper from the 
confectioner's ; lay one strip of the chocolate on it, then 
a strip of white on that, then the pink, the other white, 
and lastly the chocolate again ; then lightly press them 
to make them adhere, but not to squeeze them out of 
shape. You have now an oblong brick of parti-colored 
candy ; leave it for a few hours to harden, then trim it 
neatly with a knife and cut it crosswise into slices half 
an inch think, lay on waxed paper to dry, turning once 
in a while, and pack away in boxes. 

If jout: fondant gets very hard while you work, stand 
it over hot water a few minutes. 

Creamed candies are very fashionable just now, and, 
jonr fondant once ready, are very easy to make. 

Cream Walnuts. — Make ready some almonds, some 
walnuts in halves, some hazelnuts, or anything of the 
sort you fancy; let them be very dry. Take fondant made 



94 Culture and Cooking. 

from a pound of sugar, set it in a bowl in a saucepan of 
boiling water, stirring it till it is like cream. Then having 
flavored it with vanilla or lemon, drop in your nuts one 
by one, taking them out with the other hand on the end 
of a fork, resting it on the edge of your bowl to drain for 
a second, then drop the nut on to a waxed or buttered 
paper neatly. If the nut shows through the cream it is 
too hot ; take it out of the boiling water and beat till it 
is just thick enough to mask the nut entirely, then re- 
turn it to the boiling water, as it cools very rapidly and 
becomes unmanageable, when it has to be warmed over 
again. 

Veet FIN'S CHOCOLATE CREAMS are made as follows : 
Boil half a pound of sugar with three tablespoonfuls of 
thick cream till it makes a soft ball in water, then let it 
cool. When cool beat it till it is very white, flavor with a 
few drops of vanilla and make it into balls the size of a large 
pea; then take some unsweetened chocolate warmed, mix 
it with a piece ol fondant melted — there should be more 
chocolate than sugar — and when quite smooth and thick 
enough to mask the cream, drop them in from the end 
of a fork, take them out, and drop on to wax paper. 

Another very fine candy to be made without heat, 
and therefore convenient for hot weather, is made as 
follows : 

Punch Deops. — Sift some powdered sugar. Have 
ready some fine white gum-arabic, put a tablespoonful 
with the sugar (say half a pound of sugar), and make it 
into a firm paste ; if too wet, addmoi-e sugar, flavor with 
lemon and a tiny speck of tartaric acid or a very little lem- 
on juice. Make the paste into small balls, then take more 
sugar and make it into icing with a spoonful of Santa 
Cruz rum and half the white of an egg. Try if it 



French Candy at Home. 95 

hardens, if not, beat in more sugar and color it a bright 
pink, then.dip each ball in the pink icing and harden 
on wax pa^er. These are very novel, beautiful to look 
at, and the flavors may vary to taste. 

To MAKE Cochineal Oolobing which is quite 
Harmless. — Take one ounce of powdered cochineal, 
one ounce of cream of tartar, two drachms of alum, 
half a pint of water ; boil the cochineal, water, and 
cream of tartar till reduced to one half, then add the 
alum, and put up in small bottles for use. Yellow is 
obtained by the infusion of Spanish saffron in a little 
water, or a still better one from the grated rind of a 
ripe orange put into muslin, and a little of the juice 
squeezed through it. 

Be careful in boiling the sugar toT fondant, not to stir 
it after it is dissolved ; stirring causes it to become rough 
instead of creamy. 



CHAPTER XIV. 

A CHAPTER FOE PEOPLE OF TERT SMALL MEAN'S. 

I AM sorry to say in these days this chapter may ap- 
peal to many, who are yet not to be called "poor peo- 
ple," who may have been well-to-do and only sutfering 
from the pressure of the times, and for whose cultivated 
appetites the coarse, substantial food of the laboring man 
(even if they could buy it) would not be eatable, who 
must have what they do have good, or starve. But, as 
some of the things for which I give recipes will seem 
over-economical for people who can afford to buy meat 
at least once a day, I advise those who have even fifty 
dollars a month income to skip it ; reminding them, if 
they do not, "that necessity knows no law." 

A bone of soup meat can be got at a good butcher's 
for ten or fifteen cents, and is about the best invest- 
ment, for that sum I know of, as two nourishing and 
savory meals, at least, for four or five persons can be 
got from it. 

Carefully make a nice soup, with plenty of vegetables, 
rice, or any other thickening you like. Your bone will 
weigh from four to six pounds, perhaps ; put it on with 
water according to size, and let it boil down slowly until 
nice and strong. If you have had any scraps of meat or 
bones, put them also to your soup. 

When you serve it, keep back a cup of soup and a few 



Chapter for People of Very Small Means. 97 

of the vegetables, and save the meat, from which you 
caa make a very appetizing hash in the following way : 
Take the meat from the bone, chop it with some cold 
potatoes and the vegetables you saved from the soup. 
Cold stewed onions, boiled carrots or turnips, all help to 
make the dish savory. Chop an onion very fine, unless 
you have cold ones, a little parsley and thyme, if liked, 
and sometimes, for variety's sake, if you have it, a pinch 
of curry powder, not enough to make it hot or yellow, 
yet to impart piquancy. If you have a tiny bit of fried 
bacon or cold ham or cold pork, chop it with the other 
ingredients, mix all well, moisten with the cold soup, 
and, when nicely seasoned, put the hash into an iron 
frying-pan, in which you have a little fat made hot ; 
pack it smoothly in, cover it with a pot-lid, and either 
set it in a hot oven, or leave it to brown on the stove. 
If there was more soup than enough to moisten the hash, 
put it on in a tiny saucepan, with a little brown flour 
made into a paste with butter, add a drop of tomato cat- 
sup, or a little stewed tomato, or anything you have for 
flavoring, and stir till it boils. Then turn the hash out 
whole on a dish, it should be brown and crisp, pour the 
gravy you have made round it, and serve. For a change 
make a pie of the hash, pouring the gravy in through 
a hole in the top when done. 

It is not generally known that a very nice plain paste 
can be made with a piece of bread dough, to which you 
have added an egg, and some lard, dripping, or butter. 
The dripping is particularly nice for the hash pie, and, 
as you need only a piece of dough as large as an orange, 
you will probably have enough from the soup, if you 
skimmed off all the fat before putting the vegetables in 
(sQO pot-au-feu) ; work your dripping into the dough, 
5 



98 Culture and Cooking. 

and let it rise well, then roll as ordinary pie-crust. Po- 
tato crust is also very good for plain pies of any sort, but 
as there are plenty of recipes for it, I will not give one 
here. 

One of the very best hashes I ever ate was prepared 
by a lady who, in better times, kept a very fine table. 
And she told me there were a good many cold beans 
in it, well mashed ; and often since, when taking " trav- 
elers' hash" in an hotel, I have thought of that savory 
dish with regret. 

Instead of making your chopped meat into hash, vary 
it, by rolling the same mixture into egg-shaped pieces, 
or flat cakes, flouring them, and frying them nicely in 
very hot fat ; pieces of pork or bacon fried and laid 
round will help out the dish, and be an improvement 
to what is already very good. 

To return once more to the soup bone. If any one of 
your family is fond of marrow, seal up each end of the 
bone with a paste made of flour and waiter. When done, 
take off the paste, and remove the marrow. Made very 
hot, and spread on toast, with pepper and salt, it will be 
a relish for some one's tea or breakfast. 

In this country there is a prejudice against sheep's 
liver ; while in England, where beef liver is looked upon 
as too coarse to eat (and falls to the lot of the " cats- 
meat man," or cat butcher), sheep's is esteemed next to 
calf's, and it is, in fact, more delicate than beef liver. 
The nicest way to cook it is in very tliin slices (not the 
inch-thick pieces one often sees), each slice dipped in 
flour and fried in pork or bacon fat, and pork or bacon 
served with it. But the more economical way is to put 
it in a pan, dredge it with flour, pin some fat pork over 
it, and set it in a hot oven ; when very brown take it out ; 



Chapter for People of Very Small Means. 99 

make nice "brown gravy by pouring water in the pan and 
letting it boil on the stove, stirring it well to dissolve the 
glaze ; pour into the dish, and serve. The heart should 
be stuffed with bread-crumbs, paisley, thyme, and a lit- 
tle onion, and baked separately. 0]-, for a change, you 
may chop the liver up with a few sweet herbs and a lit- 
tle pork (onion, or not, as you like), and some bread- 
crumbs. Put all together in a crock, dredge with flour, 
cover, and set in a slow oven for an hour and a half ; 
then serve, with toasted bread around the dish. 

It is very poor economy to buy inferior meat. One 
pound of fine beef has more nourishment than two of 
poor quality. But there is a great difference in prices of 
different parts of meat, and it is better management to 
choose the cheap part of fine beef than to buy the sir- 
loin of a poor ox even at the same price ; and, by good 
cooking many parts not usually chosen, and therefore 
sold cheaply, can be made very good. Yet you must 
remember, that a piece of meat at seven cents a pound, 
in which there is at least half fat and bone, such as 
brisket, etc., is less economical than solid meat at ten or 
twelve. 

Pot roasts are very good for parts of meat not tender 
enough for roasting, the "cross-rib," as some butch- 
ers term it, being very good for this purpose ; it is all 
solid meat, and being very lean, requires a little fat pork, 
which may be laid at the bot'om of the pot ; or better 
still, holes made in the meat and pieces of the fat drawn 
through, larding in a rough way, so that they cut to- 
gether. A pot roast is best put on in an iron pot, with- 
out water, allowed to get finely brown on one side, then 
turned, and when thoroughly brown on the other a little 
water may be added for gravy ; chop parsley or any 



100 Culture and Cooking. 

seasoning that is preferred. Give your roast at least 
three hours to cook. Ox cheek, as the head is called, is 
very good, and should be very cheap ; prepare it thus : 

Clean the cheek, soak it in water six hours, and cut 
the meat from the bones, which break up for soup; 
then take the meat, cut into neat pieces, put it in an 
earthen crock, a layer of beisf, some thin pieces of pork 
or bacon, some onions, carrots, and turnips, cut thin, or 
chopped fine, and sprinkled over the meat ; also, some 
chopped parsley, a little thyme, and bay leaf, pepper 
and salt, and a clove to each layer ; then more beef and 
a little pork, vegetables, and seasoning, as before. "When 
all your meat is in poar over it, if you have it, a tum- 
bler of hard cider and one of water, or else two of water, 
in which put a half gill of vinegar. If you have no 
tight-fitting cover to your crock, put a paste of flour and 
water over it to keep the steam in, Place the crock in a 
slow oven five or six hours, and when it is taken out re- 
move the crust and skim. Any piece of beef cooked in 
this way is excellent. 

Ox heart is one of the cheapest of dishes, and really 
remarkably nice, and it is much used by economical peo- 
ple abroad. 

The heart should be soaked in vinegar and water three 
or four hours, then cut off the lobes and gristle, and 
stuff it with fat pork chopped, bread-crumbs, parsley, 
thyme, pepper, and salt ; then tie it in a cloth and very 
slowly simmer it (large end up) for two hours ; take it 
up, remove the cloth, and flour it, and roast it a nice 
brown. Lay in the pan in which it is to be roasted some 
fat pork to baste it. Any of this left over is excellent 
hashed, or, warmed in slices with a rich brown gravy, can- 
not be told from game. Another way is to stuff it with 



Chapter for People of Very Small Means. lOl 

sage and onions. It must always be served very hot with 
hot plates and on a Tery hot dish. 

Fore quarter of mutton is another very economical part 
of meat, if you get your butcher to cut it so that it may 
not only be economical, but really afford a choice joint. 
Do not then let him hack the shoulder across, but, before 
he does a thing to it, get him to take the shoulder out in 
a round plate-shaped joint, with knuckle attached ; if 
he does this well, that is, cuts it close to the bone of the 
ribs, you will have a nice joint ; then do not have it 
chopped at all ; this should be roasted in the oven very 
nicely, and served with onion sauce or stewed onions. If 
onions are not liked, mashed turnips are the appro- 
priate vegetable. This joint, to be enjoyed, must be 
properly carved, and that is, across the middle from the 
edge to the bone, the same as a leg of mutton ; and like 
the leg, you must learn, as I cannot describe it in words, 
where the bone lies, then have that side nearest you and 
cut from the opposite side. 

You have, besides this joint, another roast from the 
ribs, or else cut it up into chops till you come to the 
part under the shoulder ; from this the breast should be 
separated and both either made into a good Irish stew, 
or the breast prepared alone in a way I shall describe, 
the neck and thin ribs being stewed or boiled. 

The neck of mutton is very tender boiled and served 
with parsley or caper sauce ; the liquor it is boiled in 
served as broth, with vegetables and rice, or prepared as 
directed in a former chapter for the broth from leg of 
mutton. 

The mode I am about to give of preparing breast of 
mutton was told me by a Welsh lady of rank, at whose 
table I ate it (it appeared as a side dish), and who said. 



I02 Culture and Cooking. 

half laughingly, " Will you take some ' flufE ' ? We are 
Tery fond of it, but breast of mutton is such a despised 
dish I never expect any one else to like it." I took it, 
on my principle of trying everything, and did find it 
very good. This lady told me that, having of course a 
good deal of mutton killed on her father's estate, and the 
breast being always despised by the servants, she had in- 
vented a way of using it to avoid waste. Herway was this: 

Set the breast of mutton on the fire whole. Just cov- 
ered with water in which is a little salt. When it comes 
to the boil draw it back and let it simmer three hours ; 
then take it up and draw out the bones, and lay a force- 
meat of bread-crumbs, parsley, thyme, chopped suet, 
salt and pepper all over it ; double or roll it, skewer it, 
and coat it thickly with %^g and bread-crumbs ; then 
bake in a moderate oven, basting it often with nice drip- 
ping or butter ; when nicely brown it is done, and eats 
like the tenderest lamb. It was, when I saw it, served on 
a bed of spinach. I like it better on a bed of stewed 
onions. 

I now give some dishes made without meat. 

Eagout of Cucumber and Okions. — Fry equal 
quantities of large cucumbers and onions in slices until 
they are a nice brown. The cucumber will brown more 
easily if cut up and put to drain some time before using ; 
then flour each slice. When both are brown, pour on 
them a cup of water, and let them stew for half an hour ; 
then take a good piece of butter in which you have 
worked a dessert-spoonful of flour (browned) ; add pep- 
per, salt, and a little tomato catsup or stewed tomato. 
This is a rich-eating dish if nicely made, and will help 
out cold meat or a scant quantity of it very well. A 
little cold meat may be added if you have it. 



Chapter for People of Very Small Means. 103 

Oinoiir Soup. — Fry six large onions cut into slices 
with a quarter of a pound of butter till they are of a 
bright brown, then well mix in a tablespoonful of flour, 
and pour on them rather more than a quart of water. 
Stew gently until the onions are quite tender, season' 
with a spoonful of salt and a little sugar ; stir in quickly 
a liaison made with the yolks of two eggs mixed with 
a gill of milk or cream (do not let it boil afterwards), 
put some toast in a tureen, and serve yery hot. 

Pea Soup. — Steep some yellow split peas all night, next 
morning .set them on to boil with two quarts of water to a 
pint of peas ; in the water put a tiny bit of soda. In an- 
other pot put a large carrot, a turnip, an onion, and a 
large head of celery, all cut small and covered with water. 
"When both peas and vegetables are tender, put them 
together, season with salt, pepper, and a little sugar, 
and let them gently stew till thick enough ; then strain 
through a colander, rubbing the vegetables well, and 
return to the pot while you fry some sippets of bread a 
crisp brown ; then stir into the soup two ounces of but- 
ter in which you have rolled a little flour. 

This soup is simply delicious, and the fact of it being 
maigre will not be remembered. 

Potato Soup is another of this good kind, for meat is 
scarcely required, so good is it without. 

Boil some potatoes, then rub them through a colandar 
into two quarts of hot milk (skimmed does quite well); 
have some fine-chopped parsley and onion, add both 
with salt and pepper, stew three quarters of an hour ; 
then stir in a large piece of butter, and beat two eggs 
with a little cold milk, stir in quickly, and serve with 
fried bread. There should be potatoes enough to make 
the soup as thick as cream. 



I04 Culture and Cooking. 

Do not be prejudiced against a dish because there is 
no meat in it, and you think it cannot be nourishing. 
Tliis chapter is not written for those with whom meat, 
or money, is plentiful ; and if it be true that man is 
nourished " not by what he eats, but by what he assim- 
ilates/' and, according to an American medical author- 
ity, "what is eaten with distaste is not assimilated" 
(Dr. Hall), it follows that an enjoyable dinner, even 
without meat, will be more nourishing than one forced 
down because it lacks savor ; that potato soup will be 
more nourishing than potatoes and butter, with a cup of 
milk to drink, because more enjoyable. Yet it costs no 
more, for the soup can be made without the eggs if they 
are scarce. 

Or say bread and butter and onions. They will not 
be very appetizing, especially if they had to be a fre- 
quent meal, yet onion soup is made from the same ma- 
terials, and in France is a very favorite dish, even with 
those well able to put meat in it if they wished. 



CHAPTEE XV. 

A FEW THINGS IT IS WELL TO REMEMBER. 

Every housekeeper has pet " wrinkles " of her own 
which she thinks are especially valuable ; some are 
known to all the world, others are new to many. So 
it may be with mine ; but, on the chance that some few 
things are as new to my friends as they were to me, I 
jot them down without any pretense of order or regu- 
larity. 

Lemons will keep fresher and better in water than any 
other way. Put them in a crock, cover them with water. 
They will in winter keep two of three months, and the 
peel be as fresh as the day they were put in. Take care, 
of course, that they do not get frosted. In summer 
change the water twice a week ; they will keep a long 
time. 

In grating nutmegs begin at the flower end ; if you 
commence at the other, there will be a hole all the way 
through. 

Tea or coilee made hot (not at all scorched), before 
water is added, are more fragrant and stronger. Thus, 
by putting three spoonfuls of tea in the pot and setting 
in a warm place before infusing, it will be as strong as 
if you make tea with four spoonfuls without warming it, 
and much more fragrant. 

Vegetables that are strong caa be made much milder 
5* 105 



io6 Culture and Cooking. 

by tying a bit of bread in a clean rag and boiling it with 

them. 

Bread dough is just as good made the day before it is 
used ; thus, a small family can have fresh bread one day, 
rolls the nest, by putting the dough in a cold place en- 
veloped in a damp cloth. In winter, kept cold, yet not 
in danger of freezing, it will keep a week. 

Celery seed takes the place of celery for soup or stews 
when it is scarce ; parsley seed of parsley. 

Green beans, gherkins, etc., put down when plentiful 
in layers of rock salt, will keep crisp and green for 
months, and can be taken out and pickled when con- 
venient. 

Lemon or orange peel grated and mixed with powdered 
sugar and a squeeze of its own juice (the sugar making 
it into paste) is excellent to keep for flavoring ; put it 
into a little pot and it will keep for a year. 

Bread that is very stale may be made quite fresh for 
an hour or two by dipping it quickly into milk or water, 
and putting it in a brisk oven till quite hot through. It 
must be eaten at once, or it will be as stale as ever when 
cold. 

Meat to be kept in warm weather should be rubbed over 
with salad oil, every crevice filled with ginger ; meat that 
is for roasting or frying is much better preserved in this 
way than with salt ; take care that every part of the sur- 
face has a coat of oil. Steaks or chops cut off, which 
always keep badly, should be dipped into warm butter or 
even dripping, if oil is not handy (the object being to 
exclude the air), and then hung up till wanted. 

Mutton in cold weather should be hung four or five 
weeks in a place not subject to changes of temperature, 
and before it is so hung, every crevice filled with ginger

and thoroughly dredged with flour, which must be then 
rubbed in with the hand till the surface is quite dry. 
This is the English fashion of keeping venison. 

It may be useful for those who burn kerosene to know 
that when their lamps smell, giye a bad light, and smoke, 
it is not necessary to buy new burners. Put the old 
ones in an old saucepan with water' and a tablespoonful 
of soda, let them boil half an hour, wipe them, and 
your trouble will be over. 

Meat that has become slightly tainted may be quite 
restored by washing it in water in which is a teaspoonful 
of borax, cutting away every part in the least discolored. 

In summer when meat comes from the butcher's, if it 
is not going to be used the same day, it should be washed 
over with vinegar. 

Poultry in summer should always have a piece of 
charcoal tied in a rag placed in the stomach, to be re- 
moved before cooking. Pieces of charcoal should also 
be piit in the refrigerator and changed often. 

Oyster shells put one at a time in a stove that is 
"clinkered" will clean the brioks entirely. They 
should be put in when the fire is burning brightly. 

Salt and soapstone powder (to be bought at the drug- 
gist's) mend fire brick ; use equal quantities, make into a 
paste with water, and cement the brick ; they will be as 
strong as new ones. 

Ink spilled on carpets may be entirely removed by 
rubbing while wet with blotting paper, using fresh as 
it soils. 



CHAPTER XVI. 

OK SOME TABLE PEEJUDICES. 

Many people hare strong prejudices against certain 
tilings which they have never even tasted, or which they 
do frequently take and like as a part of something else, 
without knowing it. How common it is to hear and 
see untraveled people declare that they dislike garlic, 
and could not touch anything with it in. Yet those 
very people will take Worcestershire sauce, in which gar- 
lic is actually predominant, with everything they eat ; 
and think none but English pickles eatable, which 
owe much of their excellence to the introduction of a 
soup^on of garlic. Therefore I beg those who actually 
only know garlic from hearsay abuse of it, or from its 
presence on the breath of some inveterate garlic eater, 
to give it a fair trial when it appears in a recipe. It is 
Just one of those things that require the most delicate 
handling, for which the French term a " susjncion " is 
most appreciated ; it should only be a suspicion, its 
presence should never be pronounced. As Blot once 
begged his readers, " Give garlic a fair trial in a remo- 
lade sauce." (Montpellier butter beaten into mayonnaise 
is a good remolade for cold meat or fish. ) 

Curry is one of those things against which many are 
strongly prejudiced, and I am. inclined to think it is 

108 



On Some Table Prejudices. 109 

quite an acquired taste, but a taste which is an enyi- 
able one to its possessors ; for them there is endless 
Tariety in all they eat. The capabilities of curry are 
very little known in this country, and, as the taste for 
it is so limited, I will not do more in its defense than 
indicate a pleasant use to which it may be put, and in 
which form it would be a welcome condiment to many 
to whom "a curry," pure and simple, would be obnox- 
ious. I once knew an Anglo-Indian who used curry as 
most people use cayenne ; it was put in a pepper-box, 
and with it he would at times pepper his fish or kidneys, 
even his eggs. Used in this way, it imparts a delightful 
piquancy to food, and is neither hot nor " spicy." 

Few people are so prejudiced as the English generally, 
and the stay-at-home Americans ; but the latter are to 
be taught by travel, the Englishman rarely. 

The average Briton leaves his island shores with the 
conviction that he will get nothing- fit to eat till he gets 
back, and that he will have to be uncommonly careful 
once across the channel, or he will be having fricasseed 
frogs palmed on him for chicken. Poor man! in his 
horror of frogs, he does not know that the Paris res- 
taurateur who should give the costly frog for chicken, 
would soon end in the bankruptcy court. 

" If I could only get a decent dianer, a good roast 
and plain potato, I would like Paris much better," said 
an old Englishman to me once in that gay city. 

"But surely you can." 

"'Eo ; I have been to restaurants of every class, and 
called for beefsteak and roast beef, but have never got 
the real article, although it's my belief," said he, lean- 
ing forward solemnly, "that I have eaten Tiorse three 
times this week." Of course the Englishman of rank,

who has spent half his life on the continent, is not at all 
the average Englishman. 

Americans think the hare and rabbits, of which the 
English make such good use, very mean food indeed, 
and if they are unprejudiced enough to try them, from 
the fact that they are never well cooked, they dislike 
them, which prejudice the English reciprocate by look- 
ing on squirrels as being as little fit for food as a rat. 
And a familiar instance of prejudice from ignorance 
carried even to insanity, is that of the Irish in 1848, 
starving rather than eat the "yaller male," sent them 
by generous American sympathizers ; yet they come here 
and soon get over that dislike. ISTot so the French, who 
look on oatmeal and Indian meal as most unwholesome 
food. "■ Qa pese sur Testomac, pa creuse Testomac," I 
heard an old Frenchwoman say, trying to dissuade a 
mother from giving her children mush. 

The moral of all of which is, that for our comfort's 
sake, and the general good we should avoid unreason- 
able prejudices against unfamiliar food. "We of course 
have a right to our honest dislikes ; but to condemn 
things because we have heard them despised, is pre- 
judice. 



CHAPTEE XVII. 

A CHAPTEE OF ODDS AND ENDS — VALBDICTOET. 

I HAVE alluded, in an earlier chapter, to the fact that 
many inexperienced cooks are afraid of altering recipes ; 
a few words on this subject may not be out of place. As 
a rule, a recipe should be faithfully followed in all im- 
portant points ; for instance, in making soup you can- 
not, because you are short of the given quantity of meat, 
put the same amount of water as directed for the full 
quantity, without damaging your soup ; but you may eas- 
ily reduce water and every other ingredient in the same 
proportion ; and, in mere matters of flavoring, you may 
vary to suit circumstances. If you are told to use cloves, 
and have none, a bit of mace may be substituted. 

If you read a recipe, and it calls for something you 
have not, consider whether that something has anything 
to do with the substance of the dish, or whether it is 
merely an accessory for which something else can be 
substituted. For instance, if you are ordered to use 
cream in a sauce, milk with a larger amount of well- 
washed butter may take its place ; but if you are told to 
use cream for charlotte russe or trifles, there is no way in 
which you could make milk serve, since it is not an 
accessory but the chief part of those dishes. For a 
cake in which cream is used, butter whipped to a cream 
may take its place. "Wine is usually optional in savory 
dishes ; it gives richness only. 

Ill 



112 Culture and Cooking. 

Again, in cakes be very careful the exact proportions 
of flour, eggs, and milk are observed ; of butter you can 
generally use more or kss, having a more or less rich 
cake in proportion. In any but plain cup cakes (which 
greatly depend on soda and acid for their lightness) 
never lessen the allowance of eggs ; never add milk if a 
cake is too stifE (but an extra egg may always be used), 
unless milk is ordered in the recipe, when more or less 
may be used as needed. Flavoring may be always varied. 

In reducing a recipe always redace every ingredient, 
and it can make no difference in the results. Some- 
times, in cookery books, you are told to use articles not 
frequently found in ordinary kitchens ; for instance, a 
larding-needle (although that can be bought for twenty- 
five cents at any house-furnishing store, and should al- 
ways be in a kitchen) ; but, in case you have not one for 
meat, you may manage by making small cuts and insert- 
ing slips of bacon. 

Another article that is very useful, but seldom, if ever, 
to be found in small kitchens, is a salamander ; but when 
you wish to brown the top of a dish, and putting it in 
the oven would not do, or the oven is not quick enough 
to serve, an iron shovel, made nearly red, and a few red 
cinders in it, is a very good salamander. It must be 
held over the article that requires browning near enough 
to color it, yet not to burn. 

In the recipes I have given nothing is required that 
cannot be obtained, with more or less ease, in N^ew York. 
For syrups, fruit juices, etc., apply to your druggist; if 
he has not them he will tell you where to obtain them. 
We often make up our minds that because a thing is not 
commonly used in this country, it is impossible to get it. 
Eeally there are very few things not to be got in New 



Chapter of Odds and Ends — Valedictory. 113 

York City to the intelligent seeker. You need an arti- 
cle of Prencli or Italian or may be English grocery, that 
your grocer, a first-class one, perhaps, has not, and you 
make up your mind you cannot get it. But go into the 
quarters where French people live, and you can get 
everything belonging to the French cuisine. So preju- 
diced are the French in favor of the productions of la 
telle France, that they do not believe in our parsley or 
our chives or garlic or shallots ; for I know at least one 
French grocer who imports them for his customers. On 
being asked why he brought them from France to a 
country where those very things were plentiful, he an- 
swered : 

"Oh, French herbs are much finer." 

2!f eedless to say tarragon is one of the herbs so import- 
ed, and can thus be bought ; but, as several New Jersey 
truck gardeners grow all kinds of French herbs, they can 
be got in "Washington Market, and most druggists keep 
them dried ; but for salads, Montpellier butter, and some 
other uses, the dried herb would not do, although for 
flavoring it would serve ; but the far better way is to 
grow them for yourself, as I have done. Any large 
seedsman will supply you with burnet, tarragon, and 
borage (very useful for salads, punch, etc.) seeds, and if 
you live in the country, have an herb bed ; if in town, 
there are few houses where there is not ground enough 
to serve for the purpose ; but even in these few houses 
one can have a box of earth in the kitchen window, in 
which your seeds will flourish. 

Parsley is a thing in almost daily request in winter, 

yet it is very expensive to buy it constantly for the sake 

of using the small spray that often suflBces. It is a good 

plan, therefore, in fall, to get a few roots, plant them in 

8 



114 Culture and Cooking. 

a pot or box, and they will flourish all winter, if kept 
where they will not freeze, and be ready for garnishing 
at any minute. 

Always, as far as your means allow, have eyery con- 
venience for cooking. By having utensils proper for 
every purpose you save a great deal of work and much 
vexation of spirit. Yet it should be no excuse for bad 
work that such utensils are not at hand. A willing and 
intelligent cook will make the best of what she has. 
Apropos of this very thing Gouffe relates that a friend 
of his, an "artist" of renown, was sent for to the 
chateau of a Baron Argenteuil, who had taken a large 
company with him, unexpectedly crowding the chateau 
in every part. He was shown into a dark passage in 
which a plank was suspended from the ceiling, and told 
this was to be his kitchen. He had to fashion his own 
utensils, for there was nothing provided, and his pastry 
he had to bake in a frying-pan — besides building two 
monumental jdZ«fe on that board — and -prepare a cold«w- 
ir'ee. But he cheerfully set to work to overcome diffi- 
culties, achieved his task, and was rewarded by the plau- 
dits of the diners. Such difficulties as these our servants 
never have to encounter, and a cheerful endeavor to 
make the best of everything should be the rule. Yet, 
let us spare them all the labor we can, or rather make it 
as easy and pleasant as possible ; they will be more 
proud of their well-furnished kitchen, more cheerful in 
it, than they will of one where everything for their con- 
venience is grudged, and such pride and cheerfulness 
will be your gain. 

There is always a great deal of talk about servants in 
America, how bad and inefficient they are, how badly 
they contrast with those of England. Certainly, they 



Chapter of Odds and Ends — Valedictory. 115 

are not so efficient as those of the older country ; how 
could they be ? There, girls who are intended for servants 
haye ever held before their eyes what they may or may 
not do in the future calling, and how it is to be done. 
But take one of these orderly, efficient girls, put her in 
an American family as general servant or as cook, where 
two are kept, washing and ironing to do, and a variety 
of other work, and see how your English servant would 
stare at your requirements. She has been accustomed to 
her own line of work at home; if housemaid, she has 
been dressed for the day at noon ; if cook, she has never 
done even her own washing. 

She may, and will no doubt, fall into the way of the 
country, after a while, and on account of her early habits 
of respect, will make a good servant perhaps. But many 
of them would be quite indignant at being asked to do 
the average servant's work here. I am speaking now of 
the trained servants ; but, comparing the London " maid- 
of-all-work" or "slavey" with oar own general servants, 
and considering how much more is expected of the latter, 
the comparison seems to me vastly in the favor of our own 
Bridgets. We may rest assured, however smoothly the 
wheels of household management glide along in wealthy 
families across the water, people who can only keep one 
or two have all our troubles with servants and a few 
added, and their faults are just as general a subject of 
conversation among ladies. 

Prance (out of Paris, from Parisian servants deliver 
me ! ) and Germany seem the favored lands where one 
servant does the work of three or four. Yet even they, 
are, they say, degenerating. Let us, then, be contented 
and make the best of what we have, assured that even 
Biddy is not so hopeless as she is painted. Kindness 



Ii6 Culture and Cooking. 

(not weakness), firmness, and patience work wonders, 
even with the roughest Emerald that ever crossed the 
sea. 

I have said somewhere else that you must beware of at- 
tempting too much at once ; perfect yourself in one thing 
before you attempt another. Take breaded chops or 
fried oysters, make opportunities for having them rather 
often, and do not rest satisfied until you have them as 
well fried as you have ever seen them anywhere ; " prac- 
tice makes perfect," and you certainly will achieve per- 
fection if you are not discouraged by one failure. But 
above all things never make experiments for company ; 
let them be made when it really matters little whether 
you succeed or not, and let your experiments be on a 
small scale ; don't attempt to fry a large dish of oysters 
or chops until it is a very easy task, or make more than 
half a pound of pufE paste at first ; for if you fail with a 
large task before you, you will be tired and disheartened, 
hate the sight of what you are doing, and, as a conse- 
quence, not be likely to return to it very soon. The same 
may be said of cooks ; some of them are very fond of es- 
periments, which taste I should always encourage ; but do 
not let them jump from one experiment to the other ; 
if they try a dish and fail, they often make up their 
minds that the fault is not theirs, that it is not worth 
while to " bother " with it. Here your knowledge will be 
of service ; you will show them that it can be done, how 
it should be done, and order the dish cook failed in, fre- 
quently, giving it sufiicient surveillance to prevent your 
family suffering from her inexperience ; for, as a witty 
Frenchman said of Mme. du Deffaud's cook, " Between 
her and Brinvilliers there is only the difEerence of in- 
tention." 



Chapter of Odds and Ends — Valedictory. WJ 

Pew things add more to a man or woman's social repu- 
tation than the fact that they keep a good table. It 
need not be one where 

" The strong table groans 
Beneath the smoking sirloin stretched immense ; " 

but a table where whatever you do hare will be good, 
be it pork and beans, or salmi ; the pork and beans 
would satisfy a Bostonian, the salmi Grimod de la Eey- 
niere himself. I do not admit with Di Walcott that 

" The turnpike road to people's hearts I find 
Lies through their mouths, or I mistake mankind." 

But it is a fact that good living — by this I do not 
mean extravagant living — presupposes good breeding. 
Well-bred people sometimes live badly ; but ill-bred 
people seldom or ever live well, in the right sense of 
the term. 

Now, by way of valedictory, let me repeat that I do 
not think a lady's best or proper place is the kitchen ; 
but it is quite possible to have a perfectly served table, 
yet spend very little time there. Only that one little 
hour a day that Talleyrand, the busy man full of intrigue 
and statecraft, found time to spend with his cook, would 
insure your table being well served. For, after devoting 
say a few winter months to perfecting yourself in a few 
things, you will be able to teach your cook, who is often 
ambitious to excel if put in the right way. A word here 
about cooks. 

The knowledge that if they fail to do a thing well 
you will do it yourself, will often put them on their 
mettle to do their best ; while the feeling that you don't 
know, will make them careless. 



Ii8 Culture and Cooking. 

Servants have a great deal more amour propre than 
people imagine ; therefore, stimulate it by judicious 
praise and appreciation ; let them think that to send in a 
dish perfect, is a glory to themselves as well as a pleasure 
to you. While careful to remark when alone with them 
upon any fault that results from carelessness, he equally 
careful to give all the praise you can, and repeat to 
them complimentary remarks that may have heen made 
on their skill. Servants are usually — such is the weak- 
ness of feminine nature, whether in the drawing-room 
or the kitchen — very sensitive to the praise or blame of 
the gentlemen of the family. Indulge poor humanity a 
little when you honestly can.

PREFACE 



This is not a cookery book. It makes no attempt to 
replace a good one ; it is rather an effort to fill up the 
gap between you and your household oracle, whether 
she be one of those exasperating old friends who mad- 
dened our mother with their vagueness, or the newer 
and better lights of our own generation, the latest and 
best of all being a lady as well known for her novels as 
for her works on domestic economy — one more proof, if 
proof were needed, of the truth I endeavor to set forth 
— if somewhat tediously forgive me — in this little book : 
that cooking and cultivation are by no means antagonis- 
tic. Who does not remember with affectionate admira- 
tion Charlotte Bronte taking the eyes out of the pota- 
toes stealthily, for fear of hurting the feelings of her 
purblind old servant ; or Margaret Fuller shelling peas ? 

The chief difficulty, I fancy, with women trying 
recipes is, that they fail and know not why they fail, 
and so become discouraged, and this is where I hope 
to step in. But although this is not a cookery book, 
insomuch as it does not deal chiefly with recipes, I shall 
yet give a few ; but only when they are, or I believe

them to be, better than those in general use, or good 
things little known, or supposed to belong to the do- 
main of a French clief, of which I have introduced a 
good many. Should I succeed in making things that 
were obscure before clear to a few women, I shall be as 
proud as was Mme. de Genlis when she boasts in her 
Memoirs that she has taught six new dishes to a Ger- 
man housewife. Six new dishes ! When Brillat-Sava- 
rin says : '^ He who has invented one new dish has 
done more for the pleasure of mankind than he who has 
discovered a star."

CULTUEE AND CoOKING, 



CHAPTER I. 



* A FEW PRELIMIN'ARY REMARKS. 

Alexandre Dumas, pere, after writing five hundred 
novels, says, **I wish to close my literary career with a 
book on cooking.'' 

And in the hundred pages or so of preface — or perhaps 
overture would be the better word, since in it a group 
of literary men, while contributing recondite recipes, 
flourish trumpets in every key — to his huge volume he 
says, "I wish to be read by people of the world, and 
practiced by peojole of the art " {gens de Vart) ; and al- 
though / wish, like every one who writes, to be read by 
all the world, I wish to aid the practice, not of the pro- 
fessors of the culinary art, but those whose aspirations 
point to an enjoyment of the good things of life, but 
whose means of attaining them are limited. 

There is a great deal of talk just now about cooking ; 
in a lesser degree it takes its place as a popular topic 
with ceramics, modern antiques, and household art. The 
fact of it being in a mild way fashionable may do a lit- 
tle good to the eating world in general. And it may 
make it more easy to convince young women of refined 
1 1 



2 Culture and Cooking. 

proclivities that the art of cooking is not beneath their 
attention, to know that the Queen of England's daugh- 
ters — and of course the cream of the London fair — have 
attended the lectures on the subject delivered at South 
Kensington, and that a young lady of rank, Sir James 
Coles's daughter, has been recording angel to the asso- 
ciation, is in fact the R. C. 0. who edits the *' Official 
Handbook of Cookery." 

But, notwithstanding all that has been done by South 
Kensington lectures in London and Miss Corson's Cook- 
ing School in New York to popularize the culinary art, 
one may go into a dozen houses, and find the ladies of 
the family with sticky fingers, scissors, and gum pot, 
busily porcehiinizing clay jars, and not find one where 
they are as zealously trying to work out the i)roblems of 
the " Official Handbook of Cookery." 

I have nothing to say against the artistic distractions 
of the day. Anything that will induce love of the beau- 
tiful, and remove from us the possibility of a return to 
the horrors of hair-cloth andbrocatel and crochet tidies, 
will be a stride in the right direction. But what I do 
protest against, is the fact, that the same refined girls 
and matrons, who so love to adorn their houses that they 
will spend hours improving a pickle jar, mediaevalizing 
their furniture, or decorating the dinner service, will 
shirk everything that pertains to the preparation of food 
as dirty, disagreeable drudgery, and sit down to a com- 
monplace, ill-prepared meal, served on those artistic 
plates, as complacently as if dainty food were not a re- 
finement ; as if heavy rolls and poor bread, burnt or 
greasy steak, and wilted potatoes did not smack of the 
shanty, just as loudly as coarse crockery or rag carpet — 
indeed far more so ; the carpet and crockery may be due 



A Few Preliminary Remarks, 3 

to poverty, but a dainty meal or its reverse will speak 
volumes for innate refinement or its lack in the woman 
wlio serves it. You see by my speaking of rag carpets 
and dainty meals in one breath, that I do not consider 
good things to be the privilege of the rich alone. 

There are a great many dainty things the household 
of small or moderate means can have just as easily as 
the most wealthy. Beautiful bread — light, white, crisp 
— costs no more than the tough, thick-crusted boulder, 
with cavities like eye-sockets, that one so frequently 
meets with as liome-made bread. As Hood says: 

*' Who has not met with home-made bread, 
A heavy compound of putty and lead ?" 

Delicious coffee is only a matter of care, not expense — 
and indeed in America the cause of poor food, even in a 
boarding-house, is seldom in the quality of the articles 
so much as in the preparation and selection of them — 
yet an epicure can breakfast well with fine bread and 
butter and good coffee. And this leads me to another 
thing : many people think that to give too much atten- 
tion to food shows gluttony. I have heard a lady say 
with a tone of virtuous rebuke, when the conversation 
turned from fashions to cooking, '' I give very little time 
to cooking, we eat to live only " — which is exactly what 
an animal does. Eating to live is mere feeding. Brillat- 
Savarin, an abstemious eater himself, among other witty 
things on the same topic says, ^' V animal se repait, 
Thomme mange, Vhomme d^ esprit seul sait manger.''' 

Xine people out of ten, when they call a man an 
epicure, mean it as a sort of reproach, a man who is 
averse to every-day food, one whom plain fare would 
fail to satisfy ; but Grimod de la Reyniere, the most eel- 



4 Culture and Cooking, 

ebrated gourmet of his day, author of '^Almanack des 
Gourmands f^^ and authority on all matters culinary of the 
last century, said, '^ A true epicure can dine well on one 
dish, provided it is excellent of its kind." Excellent, 
that is it. A little care will generally secure to us the 
refinement of having only on the table what is excellent 
^*. its kind. If it is but potatoes and salt, let the salt be 
. 'ound fine, and the potatoes white and mealy. Thack- 

ay says, an epicure is one who never tires of brown 

ead and fresh butter, and in this sense every Kew 
Yorker who has his rolls from the Brevoort House, and 
uses Darlington butter, is an epicure. There seems to 
me, more mere animalism in wading through a long 
bill of fare, eating three or four indilferently cooked 
vegetables, fish, meat, poultry, each second-rate in qual- 
ity, or made so by bad cooking, and declaring that you 
have dined well, and are easy to please, than there is in 
taking pains to have a perfectly broiled chop, a fine po- 
tato, and a salad, on which any true epicure could dine 
well, while on the former fare he would leave the table 
hungry. 

Spenser points a moral for m,e when he says, speaking 
of the Irish in 1580, '' That wherever they found a plot 
of shamrocks or water-cresses they had a feast ;" but there 
were gourmets even among them, for ^^some gobbled 
the green food as it came, and some picked the faultless 
stalks, and looked for the bloom on the leaf." 

Thus it is, when I speak of '^ good living," I do not 
mean expensive living or high living, but living so that 
the table may be as elegant as the dishes on which it is 
served. 

I believe there exists a feeling, not often expressed per- 
haps, but prevalent among young people, that for a lady 



A Few Preliminary Remarks. 5 

to cook with her own hands is yulgar; to loye to do it 
shows that she is of low intellectual caliber, a sort of 
drawing-room Bridget. When or how this idea arose it 
would be difficult to say, for in the middle ages cooks 
were oltten noble ; a Montmorency was chef de cuisine to 
Philip of Valois ; Montesquieu descended, and was not 
ashamed of his descent, from the second cook of the 
Connetable de Bourbon, who ennobled him. And from 
Lord Bacon, ^"^ brightest, greatest, meanest of mankind," 
who took, it is said, great interest in cooking, to Talley- 
rand, the Machiavelii of France, who spent an hour every 
day with his cook, we find great men delighting in the 
art as a recreation. 

It is surprising that such an essentially artistic people 
as Americans should so neglect an art which a great 
French writer calls the *^ science mignonne of all dis- 
tinguished men of the world." Xapoleon the Great so 
fully recognized the social yalue of keeping a good table 
that, although no gourmet himself, he wished all his 
chief functionaries to be so. *'Keep a good table," he 
told them; ^^ if 3'ou get into debt for it I will pa}^" 
And later, one of his most devoted adherents, the Mar- 
quis de Cussy, out of favor with Louis XVIIL on 
account of that very devotion, found his reputation as 
a gourmet very serviceable to him. A friend applied 
for a place at court for him, which Louis refused, till he 
heard that M. de Cussy had invented the mixture of 
cream, strawberries, and champagne, when he granted 
the petition at once. Nor is this a solitary instance in 
history where culinary skill has been a passport to for- 
tune to its possessor. Savarin relates that the Cheva- 
lier d'Aubigny, exiled from France, was in London, in 
utter poverty, notwithstanding which, by chance, he was 



6 Culture and Cooking. 

invited to dine at a tayern frequented by the young bucks 
of that day. 

After he had finished his dinner, a party of young 
gentlemen, who had been observing him from their table, 
sent one of their number with many apologies and ex- 
cuses to beg of him, as a son of a nation renowned for 
their salads, to be kind enough to mix theirs for them. 
He comj^lied, and while occupied in making the salad, 
told them frankly his story, and did not hide his pov- 
erty. One of the gentlemen, as they parted, slipped a 
five-pound note into his hand, and his need of it was so 
great that he did not obey the prompting of his pride, 
but accepted it. 

A few days later he was sent for to a great house, and 
learned on his arrival that the young gentleman he had 
obliged at the tavern had spoken so highly of his salad 
that they begged him to do the same thing again. A 
very handsome sum was tendered him on his departure, 
and afterwards he had frequent calls on his skill, until 
it became the fashion to have salads prepared by d'Au- 
bigny, who became a well-known character in London, 
and was called '' the fash ionahle salad-maker T In a few 
years he amassed a large fortune by this means, and 
was in such request that his carriage would drive from 
house to house, carrying him and his various condiments 
— for lie took with him .everything that could give 
variety to his concoctions — from one place, where his 
services were needed, to another. 

The contempt for this art of cooking is confined to this 
country, and to the lower middle classes in England. By 
the " lower middle classes" I mean, what Oarlyle terms 
thegigocracy — ?'.e., people sufficiently well-to-do tokeej^ a 
gig or phaeton — well-to-do tradesmen, small professional 



A Few Preliminary Remarks, 7 

men, the class whose womenkind would call themselyes 
*' genteel," and many absurd stories are told of the 
determined ignorance and pretense of these would-be 
ladies. But in no class above this is a knowledge of 
cooking a thing to be ashamed of ; in England, indeed, 
so far from that being the case, indifference to the sub- 
ject, or lack of understanding and taste for certain dishes 
is looked upon as a sort of proof of want of breeding. 
Not to like curry, macaroni, or parmesan, pate de fois 
gras, mushrooms, and such like, is a sign that you haye 
not been all your life accustomed to good living. Mr. 
Hardy, in his ^' Pair of Blue Eyes," cleverly hits this 
prejudice when he makes Mr. Swancourt say, '^I knew 
the fellow wasn't a gentleman; he had no acquired tastes, 
never took Worcestershire sauce." 

Abroad many women of high rank and culture de- 
vote a good deal of time to a thorough understanding 
of the subject. We have a lady of the '^ lordly line of 
proud St. Clair " writing for us '' Dainty Dishes," and 
doing it with a zest that shows she enjoys her work, 
although she does once in a while forget something she 
ought to have mentioned, and later still we have Miss 
Eose Coles writing the ^^Oflficial Handbook of Cookery." 

But it is in graceful, refined France that cooker}^ is 
and has been, a pet art. Any bill of fare or French 
cookery book will betray to a thoughtful reader t'ne at- 
tention given to the subject by the wittiest, gayest, and 
most beautiful women, and the greatest men. The high- 
sounding names attached to French standard dishes are 
no mere caprice or homage of a French cook to the great in 
the land, but actually point out their inventor. Thus 
Bechamel was invented by the Marquis de Bechamel, as 
a sauce for codfish ; while Filets de Lapereaii, a la 



8 Culture and Cookhig, 

Berry were invented by the Duchess de Berry, daughter 
of the regent Orleans, who himself invented Pain a la 
d'' Orleans, while to Richelieu we are indebted for hun- 
dreds of dishes besides the renowned mayonnaise. 

Cailles a la Mirepois, Chartreuse a la Mauconseil, 
Poulets a la Villeroy, betray the tastes of the three great 
ladies whose name they bear. 

But not in courts alone has the art had its devotees. 
Almost every great name in French literature brings to 
mind something its owner said or did about cooking. 
Dumas, who was a prince of cooks, and of whom it is 
related that in 1860, when living atVarennes, St. Maur, 
dividing his time, as usual, between cooking and litera- 
ture (LorsquHl 7ie faisait pas sauter un roman, il 
faisait sauter cles petits oignons), on Mountjoye, a 
young artist friend and neighbor, going to see him, he 
cooked dinner for him. Going into the poultry yard, 
after donning a white apron, he wrung the neck of a 
chicken; then to the kitchen garden for vegetables, 
which he peeled and washed himself ; lit the fire, got 
butter and flour ready, put on his saucepans, then cooked, 
stirred, tasted, seasoned until dinner time. Then he 
entered in triumph and announced, "Xe diner est 
servi." For six months he passed three or four days a 
week cooking for Mountjoye. This novelist's book says, 
in connection with the fact that great cooks in France 
have been men of literary culture, and literary men often 
fine cooks, '^ It is not surprising that literary men have 
always formed the entourage of a great chef, for, to 
appreciate thoroughly all there is in the culinary art, 
none are so well able as men of letters; accustomed as 
they are to all refinements, they can appreciate better 
than others those of the table," thus paying himself and 



A Few Preliminary Remarks. g 

confreres a delicate little compliment at the expense of 
the non-literary world; but, notwithstanding the naive 
self-glorification, he states a fact that helps to point my 
moral, that indifference to cooking does not indicate re- 
finement, intellect, or social pre-eminence. 

Brillat-Savarin, grave judge as he was, and abstemi- 
ous eater, yet has written the book of books on the art 
of eating. It was he who said, ^' Tell me what you eat, 
I will tell you what you are," as pregnant with truth as 
the better-known proverb it paraphrases. 

Malherbe loved to watch his cook at work. I think it 
was he who said, '^ A coarse-minded man could never be 
a cook," and Charles Baudelaire, the Poe of France, takes 
a poet's view of our daily wants, when he says, *^ that an 
ideal cook must have a great deal of the poet's nature, 
combining something of the voluptuary with the man 
of science learned in the chemical principles of matter;" 
although he goes further than we care to follow when 
he says, that the question of sauces and seasoning re- 
quires ^' a chapter as grave as a feuilleton de science.'^ 

It has been said by foreigners that Americans care 
nothing for the refinements of the table, but I think 
they do care. I have known many a woman in com- 
fortable circumstances long to have a good table, many 
a man aspire to better things, and if he could only get 
them at home would pay any money. But the getting 
them at home is the difficulty ; on a table covered with 
exquisite linen, glass, and silver, whose presiding queen 
is more likely than not a type of the American lady — 
graceful, refined, and witty — on such a table, with such 
surroundings, will come the plentiful, coarse, common- 
place dinner. 

The chief reason for this is lack of knowledge on the 



10 Culture and Cooking. 

part of our ladies: know how to do a thing yourself, and 
you will get it well done by others. But how are many 
of them to know ? The daughters of the wealthy in 
this country often marry struggling men, and they know 
less about domestic economy than ladies of the higher 
ranks abroad; not because English or French ladies take 
more part in housekeeping, but because they are at home 
all their lives. Ladies of the highest rank never go to a 
boarding or any other school, and these are the women 
who, with some few exceptions, know best how things 
should be done. They are at home listening to criti- 
cisms from papa, who is an epicure perhaps, on the 
shortcomings of his own table, or his neighbors'; from 
mamma, as to what the soup lacks, why cook is not a 
^^ cordon Ueit,^'' etc., while our girls are at school, far 
away from domestic comments, deep in the agonies of 
algebra perhaps ; and directly they leave school, in many 
cases they marry. As a preparation for the state of 
matrimony most of them learn how to make cake and 
preserves, and the very excellence of their attainments 
in that way proves how easy it would be for them, with 
their dainty fingers and good taste, to far excel their Eu- 
ropean cousins in that art which a French writer says is 
based on "reason, health, common sense, and sound taste." 
Here let me say, I do not by any means advocate a 
woman, who can afford to pay a first-rate cook, avoiding 
the expense by cooking herself ; on the contrary, I think 
no woman is justified in doing work herself that she has 
the means given her to get done by employing others. 
I have no praise for the economical woman, who, from 
a desire to save, does her own work without necessity for 
economy. It is 7iot her work; the moment she can afford 
to employ others it is the work of some less fortunate per- 



A Few Preliminary Remarks, ii 

son. But in this country, it often happens that a good 
cook is not to be found for money, although the raw ma- 
terial of which one might be made is much oftener at 
hand. And if ladies would only practice the culinary art 
with as much, nay, half as much assiduity as they giye to 
a new pattern in crochet ; devote as much time to attain- 
ing perfection in one dish or article of food, be it per- 
fect bread, or some French dish which father, brother, 
or husband goes to Delmonico's to enjoy, as they do to 
the crochet tidies or embroidered rugs with which they 
decorate their drawing-rooms, they could then take the 
material, in the shape of any ambitious girl they may 
meet with, and make her a fine cook. In the time they 
take to make a dozen tidies, they would have a dozen 
dishes at their fingers' ends; and let me tell you^, the 
woman who can cook a dozen things, outside of j^re- 
serves, in a perfect manner is a rarity here, and a good 
cook anywhere, for, by the time the dozen are accom- 
plished, she will have learned so much of the art of cook- 
ing that all else will come easy. One good soup, bouil- 
lon, and you have the foundation of all others ; two 
good sauces, white sauce and brown, ^'les sauces meres " 
as the French call them (mothers of all other sauces), 
and all others are matters of detail. Learn to make one 
kind of roll perfectly, as light, plump, and crisp as 
Delmonico's, and all varieties are at your fingers' ends; 
you can have kringles, Vienna rolls, Kreuznach horns, 
Yorkshire tea cakes, English Sally Lunns and Bath 
buns ; all are then as easy to make as common soda bis- 
cuit. In fact, in cooking, as in many other things, " ce 
n'est que le 'premier pas que coute; " failures are almost 
certain at the beginning, but a failure is often a step 
toward success — if we only know the reason of the failure. 



CHAPTEE II. 

Oiq" BEEAD. 

Of all articles of food, bread is perhaps the one about 
which most has been written, most instruction given, 
and most failures made. Yet wJiat adds more to the 
elegance of a table than exquisite bread or breads, and 
— unless you live in a large city and depend on the baker 
— what so rare ? A lady who is very proud of her table, 
and justly so, said to me quite lately, " I cannot under- 
stand how it is we never have really fine home-made 
bread. I. have tried many recipes, following them 
closely, and I can't achieve anything but a common- 
place loaf with a thick, hard crust ; and as for rolls, 
they are my despair. I have wasted eggs, butter, and 
patience so often that I have determined to give them 
up, but a fine loaf I will try for." 

*' And when you achieve the fine loaf, you may revel 
in home-made rolls," I answered. 

And so I advise every one first to make perfect bread, 
light, white, crisp, and thin-crusted, that rarest thing 
in home-made bread. 

I have read over many recipes for bread, and am con- 
vinced that when the time allowed for rising is specified, 
it is invariably too short. One standard book directs 
you to leave your sponge two hours, and the bread when 
made up a quarter of mi hour. This recipe strictly 
followed must result in heavy, tough bread. As bread 

12 



On Bread, 13 

is so important, and so many fail, I will give my own 
method from beginning to end ; not that there are not 
numberless good recipes, but simply because they fre- 
quently need adapting to circumstances, and altering a 
recipe is one of the things a tyro fears to do. 

I make a sponge over night, using a dried yeast-cake 
soaked in a pint of warm water, to which I add a spoon- 
ful of salt, and, if the weather is warm, as much soda as 
will lie on a dime ; make this into a stiff batter with 
flour — it may take a quart or less, flour varies so much, 
to give a rule is impossible ; but if, after standing, the 
sponge has a watery appearance, make it thicker by 
sprinkling in more flour, beat hard a few minutes, and 
cover with a cloth — in winter keep a piece of thick flan- 
nel for the purpose, as a chill is fatal to your sponge— 
and set in a warm place free from draughts. 

The next morning, when the sponge is quite light- 
that is to say, at least twice the bulk it was, and like a 
honeycomb — take two quarts of flour, more or less, as 
you require, but I recommend at first a small baking, 
and this will make three small loaves ; in winter, flour 
should be dried and warmed ; put it in your mixing 
bowl, and turn the sponge into a hole in the center. 
Have ready some water, rather more than lukewarm, but 
not liot. Add it gradually, stirring your flour into the 
sponge at the same time. The great fault in making 
bread is getting the dough too stiff ; it should be as soft 
as possible, without being at all sticky or wet. Now 
knead it with both hands from all sides into the center ; 
keep this motion, occasionally dipping your hands into 
the flour if the dough sticks, but do not add more flour 
unless the paste sticks very much ; if you have the right 
consistency it will be a smooth mass, very soft to the 



14 Culture and Cooking, 

touch, yet not sticky, but this may not be attained at a 
first mixing without adding flour by degrees. When 
you have kneaded the dough until it leaves the bowl all 
round, set it in a warm place to rise. When it is well 
risen, feels very soft and warm to the touch, and is twice its 
bulk, knead it once more thoroughly, then put it in tins 
either floured, and the flour not adhering shaken out, or 
buttered, putting in each a piece of dough half the size 
you intend your loaf to be. Now everything depends on 
your oven. Many people bake their bread slowly, leav- 
ing it in the oven a long time, and this causes a thick, 
hard crust. When baked in the modern iron oven, 
quick baking is necessary. Let the oven be quite hot, 
then put a little ball of paste in, and if it browns palely 
in seven to ten minutes it is about right ; if it burns, it 
is too hot ; open the damper ten minutes. Your bread, 
after it is in the tins, will rise much more quickly than 
the first time. Let it get light, but not too light — twice 
its hullc is a good rule ; but if it is light before your oven 
is ready, and thus in clanger of getting too porous, work 
it down with your hand, it will not harm it, although it 
is better so to manage that the oven waits for the bread 
rather than the bread for the oven. A small loaf — and 
by all means make them small until you have gained 
experience — will not take more than three quarters of an 
hour to bake ; when a nice yellow brown, take it out, turn 
it out of the tin into a cloth, and tap the bottom ; if it is 
crisp and smells cooked, the loaf is done. Once the bot- 
tom is brown it need remain no longer. Should that, 
however, from fault of your oven, be not brown, but 
soft and white, you must put it back in the oven, the 
bottom upwards. An oven that does not bake at the 
bottom will, however, be likely to spoil your bread. It 



-^ead, 1 5 

.a used by a careless servant leaving a col- 
^. oi ashes underneath it ; satisfy yourself that all 
ilie flues are perfectly clean and clear before beginning 
to bake, and if it still refuses to do its duty, change it, 
for you will have nothing but loss and vexation of spirit 
while you have it in use. I think you will find this 
bread white, evenly porous (not with small holes in one 
part and caverns in another ; if it is so you have made 
y'our dough too stiff, and it is not sufficiently kneaded), 
ind with a thin, crisp crust. Bread will surely fail to 
:"ise at all if you have scalded the yeast ; the water must 
lever be too hot. In winter, if it gets chilled, it will 
)nly rise slowly, or not at all, and in using baker's or 
jrerman yeast take care that it is not stale, which will 
iause heavy, irregular bread. 

In making bread with compressed yeast proceed in 
exactly the same way, excepting that the sponge will not 
need to be set over night, unless you want to bake very 
early. 

If you have once produced bread to your satisfaction 
you will find no difficulty in making rolls. Proceed as 
follows : 

Take a piece of the dough from your baking after it 
has risen once. To a piece as large as a man's fist take 
a large tablespoonful of butter and a little powdered 
sugar ; work them into the dough, put it in a bowl, cover 
it, and set it in a warm place to rise— a shelf behind the 
stove is best ; if you make this at the same time as 
your bread, you will find it takes longer to rise ; the 
butter causes that difference ; when very light, much

push it down till it is not larger than when you put it 
in the bowl ; let it rise again, and again push it down,

but not so thoroughly ; do this once or twice more, and 
you have the secret of light rolls. You will find them rise 
yery quickly, after once or twice pushing down. When 
they have risen the third or fourth time, take a little 
butter on your hands, and break off small pieces about 
the size of a walnut and roll them round. Either put 
them on a tin close together, to be broken apart, or an 
inch or two from each other, in which case work in a 
little more flour, and cut a cleft on the top, and once more 
set to rise ; half an hour will be long enough generally, 
but in this case you must judge for yourself, they some- 
times take an hour ; if they look swelled very much and 
smooth they will be ready. Have a nice hot oven, and 
bake for twelve to fifteen minutes. 

Add a little more sugar to your dough and an ^gg, go 
through the same process, brush them over with sugar 
'dissolved in milk, and you will have delicious rusks. 

The above is my own method of making rolls, and the 
simplest I know of; but there are numbers of other 
recipes given in cookery books which would be just as 
good if the exact directions for letting them rise were 
given. As a test — and every experiment you try will be 
so much gained in your experience — follow the recipe 
given for rolls in any good cookery book, take x")art of 
the dough and let it rise as therein directed, and bake, 
set the other part to rise as / direct, and notice the dif- 
ference.

brioche.

Sift one pound of flour, take one fourth of it, and add 
rather more than half a cake of compressed yeast, dis- 
solved in half a gill of warm water, make into a sponge 
with a very little more water, put it in a warm place ; 
when it is double its volume take the rest of the flour, 
make a hole in the center, and put in it an equal quantity 
of salt and sugar, about a teaspoonful, and two tablesjjoon- 
fuls of water to dissolve them. Three quarters of a pound 
of butter and four eggs, beat well, then add another ^gg, 
beat again, and add another, and so on until seven have 
been used ; the paste must be soft, but not spread ; if too 
firm, add another Qgg, Now mix this paste with the 
sponge thoroughly, beating until the paste leaves the 
sides of the bowl, then put it in a crock and cover ; let 
it stand four hours in a warm place, then turn it out on 
a board, spread it and double it four times, return it to 
the crock, and let it rise again two hours ; repeat the 
former process of doubling and spreading, and put it in 
a very cold place for two hours, or until you want to use 
it. Mold in any form you like, but the true brioche is 
two pieces, one as large again as ' the other ; form the 
large one into a ball, make a deep depression in the cen- 
ter, on which place the smaller ball, pressing it gently 
in ; cut two or three gashes round it with a sharp knife, 
and bake a beautiful golden brown. These brioche are 
such a luxury, and so sure to come out right, that the 
trouble of making them is well worth the taking, and 
for another reason : every one knows the great difficulty 
of making puff paste in summer, and a short paste is

never handsome ; but take a piece of brioche paste, roll 
it out thin, dredge with flour, fold and roll again, then 
use as you would puif paste ; if for sweet pastry, a 
little powdered sugar may be sprinkled through it in- 
stead of dredging with flour. This makes a very hand- 
some and delicious crust. Or, another use to which it 
may be put is to roll it out, cut it in rounds, lay on 
them mince-meat, orange marmalade, jam, or merely 
sprinkle with currants, chopped citron, and spices, fold, 
press the edges, and bake. 

Before quitting the subject of breads I must introduce 
a novelty which I will call '^soufflee bread." It is 
quickly made, possible even when the fire is poor, and so 
delicious that I kuow you will thank me for making 
you acquainted with it. 

Use two or three eggs according to size you wish, and 
to each ^gg a tablespoonful of flour. Mix the yolks 
with the flour and with them a dessert-spoonful of but- 
ter melted, and enough milk to make a yQYjthich batter, 
w^ork, add a pinch of salt and a teaspoouful of sugar, 
work till quite smooth, then add the whites of the eggs 
in a firm froth, stir them in gently, and add a quarter 
teaspoouful of soda and half a one of cream of tartar. 
Have ready an iron frying-pan (or an earthen one that 
will stand heat is better), made hot with a tablespoonful 
of butter in it, also hot, but not so hot as for frying. 
Pour the batter (which should be of the consistency of 
sponge cake batter) into the pan, cover it with a lid 
or tin plate, and set it back of the stove if the fire is 
hot — if very slow it may be forward ; when well risen 
and near done, put it in the oven, or if the oven 
is cold you may turn it gently, not to deaden it. 
Serve when done (try wn'th a tAvig), the under side

uppermost; it should be of a fine golden brown and 
look like an omelet. This soufflee bread is equally 
good haked in a tin in which is rather more butter than 
enough to grease it ; the oven must be very liot in- 
deed. Coyer it for the few minutes with a tin plate or 
lid, to prevent it scorching before it has risen ; when it 
has pulfed up remove the lid, and allow it to brown, ten 
to fifteen minutes should bake it ; turn it out as you 
wo;ild sponge cake — very carefully, not to deaden it. To 
succeed with bread you must use the very best flour. 



CHAPTER III. 

PASTRY. 

To MAKE good puff paste is a thing many ladies are 
anxious to do, and in which they generally fail, and this 
not so much because they do not make it properly, as 
because they handle it badly. A lady who was very 
anxious to excel in pastry once asked me to allow her to 
watch me make paste. I did so, and explained that there 
was more in the manner of using than in the making 
up. I then gave her a piece of my paste when com- 
pleted, and asked her to cover some patty pans while I 
covered others, cautioning her as to the way she must 
cover them ; yet, when those covered by her came out 
of the oven they had not risen at all, they were like rich 
short paste ; while my own, made from the same paste, 
were toppling over with lightness. I had, without say- 
ing anything, pressed my thumb slightly on one spot of 
one of mine ; in that spot the paste had not risen at all, 
and I think this practical demonstration of what I had 
tried to explain was more useful than an hour's talk 
would have been. 

I will first give my method of making, which is the 
usual French way of making ^'feuilUtonage.^^ Take 
one pound of butter, or half of it lard ; press all the 
water out by squeezing it in a cloth ; this is impor- 
tant, as the liquid in it would wet your paste ; take a 
third of the butter, or butter and lard, and rub it into 



Pastry, 23 

one poimd of fine flour ; add no salt if yonr butter is 
salted ; then take enough water (to which you may add 
the well-beaten white of an ^g^^, but it is not absolutely 
necessary) to make the flour into a smooth, firm dough; it 
must not be too stiff, or it will be hard to roll out, or 
too soft, or it will never make good paste ; it should roll 
easily, yet not stick ; work it till it is very smooth, then 
roll it out till it is half an inch thick ; now lay the whole 
of the butter in the center, fold one- third the paste oyer, 
then the other third ; it is now folded in three, with the 
butter completely hidden ; now turn the ends toward 
you, and roll it till it is half an inch thick, taking care, 
by rolling very evenly, that the butter is not pressed out 
at the other end ; now you have a piece of paste about 
two feet long, and not half that width ; flour it lightly, 
and fold over one third and under one third, which will 
almost bring it to a square again ; turn it round so that 
what was the side is now the end, and roll. Most likely 
now the butter will begin to break through, in which 
case fold it, after flouring lightly, in three, as before, and 
put it on a dish on the ice, covering it with a damp cloth. 
You may now either leave it for an hour or two, or till 
next day. Paste made the day before it is used is much 
better and easier to manage, and in winter it may be kept 
for four or five days in a cold place, using from it as 
required. 

When ready to use your paste finish the making by 
rolling it out, dredging a little flour, and doubling it-in 
three as before, and roll it out thin ; do this until from 
first to last it has been so doubled and rolled seven times. 

Great cooks differ on one or two points in making 
pastry ; for instance, Soyer directs you to put the yolk 
of an Qgg instead of the white, and a squeeze of lemon 



24 Culture and Cooking. 

juice into tlie flour, and expressly forbids you to work it 
before adding the mass of butter, wliile Jules Gouffe 
says, *^work it until smooth and shining." I cannot 
pretend to decide between these differing doctors, but I 
pursue the method I have given and always have light 
pastry. And now to the handling of it : It must only be 
touched by the lightest fingers, every cut must be made 
with a sharp knife, and done with one quick stroke so that 
the paste is not dragged at all ; in covering a pie dish or 
patty pan, you are commonly directed to mold the paste 
over it as thin as possible, which conveys the idea that the 
paste is to be pressed over and so made thin ; this would 
destroy the finest paste in the world ; roll it thin, say 
for small tartlets, less than a quarter of an inch thick, 
for a pie a trifle thicker, then lay the dish or tin to be 
covered on the paste, and cut out with a knife, dipped in 
liot water or flour, a j^iece a little larger than the mold, 
then line with the piece you have cut, touching it as little 
as possible ; press only enough to make the paste adhere 
to the bottom, but on no account press the border; to 
test the necessity of avoiding this, gently press one spot 
on a tart, before putting it in the oven, only so much as 
many people always do in making pie, and watch the 
result. When your tartlets or pies are made, take each 
up on your left hand, and with a sharp knife dipj^ed in 
flour trim it round quickly. To make the cover of a 
pie adhere to the under crust, lay the forefinger of your 
right hand lengthwise round the border, but as far from 
the edge as you can, thus forming a groove for the syrups, 
and pressing the cover on at the same time. A word 
here about fruit pies : Pile the fruit high in the center, 
leaving a space all round the sides almost bare of fruit, 
when the cover is on press gently the paste, as I have 



Pastry. 25 

explained, into this groove, then make two or three deep, 
holes in the groove ; the juice will boil out of these holes 
and run round this groove, instead of boiling out through 
the edges and wasting. 

This is the pastry-cook's way of making pies, and makes 
a much handsomer one than the usual flat method, 
besides saving your syrup. To ornament fruit pies or 
tartlets, whip the white of an Qgg, and stir in as much 
powdered sugar as will make a thin meringue — a large 
tablespoonful is usually enough— then when your pies or 
tartlets are baked, take them from the oven, glaze with 
the Qgg and sugar, and return to the oven, leaving the 
door open ; when it has set into a frosty icing they are 
ready to serve. 

It is worth while to accomplish puff paste, for so 
many dainty trifles may be made with it, which, at- 
tempted with the ordinary short paste, would be unsight- 
ly. Some of these that seem to me novel I will describe. 

Eissolettes are made with trimmings of puff paste; if 
you have about a quarter of a pound left, roll it out very 
thin, about as thick as a fifty-cent piece; put about half 
a spoonful of marmalade or jam on it, in places about 
an inch apart, wet lightly round each, and place a piece 
of paste over all ; take a small round cutter as large as 
a dollar, and press round the part where the marma- 
lade or jam is with the thick part of the cutter; then cut 
them out with a cutter a size larger, lay them on a bak- 
ing tin, brush over wdth white of Qgg\ then cut some little 
rings the size of a quarter dollar, put one on each, ^gg^ 
over again, and bake twenty minutes in a nice hot oven; 
then sift white sugar all over, put them back in the oven 
to glaze ; a little red currant jelly in each ring looks 
pretty ; serve in the form of a pyramid. 
3 



26 Culture and Cooking, 

Pastkt Tablets. — Cut strips of paste three inches 
and a half long, and an inch and a half wide, and as 
thick as a twenty -five cent piece ; lay on half of them 
a thin filmy layer of jam or marmalade, not jelly; then 
on each lay a strip without jam, and bake in a quick 
oven. When the paste is well risen and brown, take 
them out, glaze them with white of Qg^, and sugar, 
and sprinkle chopped almonds over them ; return to 
the oven till the glazing is set and the almonds just 
colored; serve them hot or cold on a napkin piled log- 
cabin fashion. 

Frangipane Tartlets.— One quarter pint of cream, 
four yolks of eggs, two ounces of flour, three macaroons, 
four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, the peel of a 
grated lemon, and a little citron cut very fine, a little 
brandy and orange-flower water. Put all the ingredi- 
ents, except the eggs, in a saucepan — of course you will 
mix the flour smooth in the cream first — let them 
come to a boil slowly, stirring to prevent lumps ; 
when the flour smells cooked, take it off the fire for 
a minute, then stir the beaten yolks of eggs into it. 
Stand the saucepan in another of boiling water and re- 
turn to the stove, stirring till the eggs seem done — about 
five minutes, if the water boils all the time. Line patty 
pans with puff paste, and fill with frangipane and bake. 
Ornament with chopped almonds and meringue, or not, 
as you please. 

It is very difficult to make fine puff paste in warm 
weather, and almost impossible without ice ; for this 
reason I think the brioche paste preferable; but if it 
is necessary to have it for any purpose, you must take 
the following precautions : 

Have your water iced ; have your butter as firm as 



Pastry, 2 J 

possible by being kept on ice till the last moment ; make 
the paste in the coolest place you have, and under the 
breeze of an open window, if possible ; make it the day 
before you use it, and put it on the ice between eyery 
"turn," as each rolling out is technically called; then 
leave it on the ice, as you use it, taking pieces from it as 
you need them, so that the warmth cannot soften the 
whole at once, w^hen it would become quite unmanage- 
able. The condition of the oven is a very important 
matter, and I cannot do better than transcribe the rules 
given by Gouffe, by which you may test its fitness for 
any purpose : 

Put half a sheet of writing paper in the oven; if it 
catches fire it is too hot; open the dampers and wait 
ten minutes, when put in another piece of paper ; if it 
blackens it is still too hot. Ten minutes later put in a 
third piece ; if it gets darlc Iroivn the oven is right for 
all small pastry. Called '^ darh Iroivn paper lieat.''' 
Light hroion paper heat is suitable for vol-au-vents or 
fruit pies. Dark yelloiu paper heat for large pieces of 
pastry or meat pies, pound cake, bread, etc. Light yel- 
loiu paper heat for sponge cake, meringues, etc. 

To obtain these various degrees of heat, you try paper 
every tsn minutes till the heat required for your purpose 
is attained. But remember that 'Might yellow" means 
the paper only tinged ; "dark yellow," the paper the 
color of ordinary pine wood; "light brown" is only a 
shade darker, about the color of nice pie-crust, and dark 
brown a shade darker, by no means coffee color. 



CHAPTER IV. 

WHAT TO HAYE IK YOUE STORE-KOOM. 

OjSTE great trouble with many young housekeepers is 
betrayed by the common remark, ^' Cookery books al- 
ways require so many things that one never has in the 
house, and they coolly order you to * moisten with gravy/ 
* take a little gravy/ as if you had only to go to the pump 
and get it." It is very true that economy in cooking is 
much aided by having a supply of various condiments ; 
warmed-over meat may then be converted into a delicious 
little entree with little trouble. I would recommend, 
therefore, any one who is in earnest about reforming 
her dinner table to begin by expending a few dollars in 
the followino: articles : 



1 bottle of capers, 



olives, 
gherkins, 
soy, 

anchovies, 
tarragon vinegar. 



bottle of claret, 

*' white wine, 
** sherry for cooking, 
" brandy, 
" Harvey sauce, 
walnut ketchup. 



And a package of compressed vegetables and a few bay leaves. 

Ten dollars thus spent may seem a good deal of money 
to a young housewife trying to make her husband's salary 
go as far as it will ; but I assure her it is in the end an 
economy, especially in a small family, who are so apt to 
get tired of seeing the same thing, that it has to be 

38 



W/iat to Have in Your Store-room, 29 

thrown or given away. With these condiments and 
others I have yet to mention you will have no trouble 
in using every scrap ; not using it and eating it from a 
sense of duty, and wishing it was something better, but 
enjoying it. With your store-room Avell provided, you 
can indeed go for gravy **as if to the pump." 

Besides the foregoing list of articles to be bought of 
any good grocer, there are others which can be made at 
home to advantage, and once made are always ready. 
Mushroom powder I prefer for any use to mushroom 
catsup ; it is easily made and its uses are infinite. 
Sprinkled over steak (when it must be sifted) or chops, 
it is delicious. For ordinary purposes, such as flavoring 
soup or gravy, it need not be sifted. To prepare it, take 
a peck of large and very fresh mushrooms, look them over 
carefully that they are not wormy, then cleanse them 
with a piece of flannel from sand or grit, then peel them 
and put them in the sun or a cool oven to dry ; they re- 
quire long, slow drying, and must become in a state to 
crumble. Your peck will have diminished by the pro- 
cess into half a pint or less of mushroom powder, but 
you have the means with it of making a rich gravy at a 
few minutes' notice. 

Apropos of gravies — that much-vexed question in 
small households — for without gravies on hand you can- 
not make good hash, or many other things that are mis- 
erable without, and excellent with it. Yet how difficult 
it is to have gravy always on hand every mistress of a 
small family knows, in spite of the constant advice to 
*^ save your trimming to make stock." Do by all means 
save your bones, gristle, odds and ends of meat of all 
kinds, and convert them into broth ; but even if you 
do, it often happens that the days you have done so no 



30 Culture and Cooking, 

gravy is required, and then it sours quickly in summer, 
although it may be arrested by reboiling. In no family 
of three or four are there odds and ends enough, unless 
there is a very extravagant table kept, to insure stock for 
every day. My remedy for this, then, is to make a 
stock that will keep for months or years — in other words, 
glaze. So very rarely forming part of a housewife's 
stores, yet so valuable that the fact is simply astonish- 
ing ; with a piece of glaze, you have a dish of soup on 
an emergency, rich gravy for any purpose, and all with 
the expenditure of less time than would make a pot of 
sweetmeats. 

Take six pounds of a knuckle of veal or leg of beef, 
cut it in pieces the size of an ^gg, as also half a pound 
of lean ham ; then rub a quarter of a pound of butter on 
the bottom of your pot, which should hold two gallons ; 
then put in the meat with half a pint of water, three 
middle-sized onions, with two cloves in each, a turnip, a 
carrot, and a small head of celery ; then place over a 
quick fire, occasionally stirring it round, until the bot- 
tom of the pot is covered with a thick glaze, which will 
adhere lightly to the spoon ; then fill ujd the pot with 
cold water, and when on the boiling point, draw it to the 
back of the stove, where it may gently simmer three 
hours, if veal, six if beef, carefully skimming it to re- 
move scum. This stock, as it is, will make a delicious 
foundation, with the addition of salt, for all kinds of 
clear soup or gravies. To reduce it to glaze proceed as 
follows : Pass the stock through a fine hair sieve or 
cloth into a pan ; then fill up the pot again with liot 
water, and let it boil four hours longer to obtain all the 
glutinous part from the meat ; strain, and pour both 
stocks in a large pot or stew-pan together ; set it over the 



What to Have in Your Store-room. 31 

fire, and let it boil as fast as possible with the lid off, 
leaving a large spoon in it to prevent it boiling over, and 
to stir occasionally. When reduced to about three pints, 
pour it into a small stew-pan or saucepan, set again to 
boil, but more slowly, skimming it if necessary ; when 
it is reduced to a quart, set it where it will again boil 
quickly, stirring it well with a wooden spoon until it 
begins to get thick and of a fine yellowish-brown color ; 
at this point be careful it does not burn. 

You may either pour it into a j^ot for use, or, what is 
more convenient for making gravies, get a sausage skin 
from your butcher, cut a yard of it, tie one end very 
tightly, then pour into it by means of a large funnel the 
glaze ; from this cut slices for use. A thick slice dis- 
solved in hot water makes a cup of nutritious soup, into 
which you may put any cooked vegetables, or rice, or 
barley. A piece is very useful to take on a journey, 
especially for an invalid who does not want to depend on 
wayside hotel food, or is tired of beef-tea. 

The foregoing is the orthodox recipe for glaze, and if 
you have to buy meat for the purpose the very best way 
in which you can make it ; but if it happen that you 
have some strong meat soup or jelly, for which you have 
no use while fresh, then boil it down till it is thick and 
brown (not burnt) ; it will be excellent glaze ; not so fine 
in flavor, perhaps, but it preserves to good use what 
would otherwise be lost. Very many people do not 
know the value of pork for making jelly. If you live in 
the country and kill a pig, use his hocks for making glaze 
instead of beef. 

Glaze also adds much to the beauty of many dishes. 
If roast beef is not quite brown enough on any one spot 
set your jar of glaze— for this purpose it is well to have 



32 Culture and Cooking. 

some put in a jar as well as in the skin — in boiling water. 
Keep a small stiff brush ; such as are sold for the pur- 
pose at house-furnishing stores, called a glazing brush, 
are best ; but you may manage with any other or even a 
stiff feather. When the glaze softens, as glue would do, 
brush over your meat with it, it will give the lacking 
brown ; or, if you have a ham or tongue you wish to 
decorate you may ^S^arnish" it, as it were, with the 
melted glaze ; then when cold beat some fresh butter to 
a white cream, and with a kitchen syringe, if you have 
one, a stiff paper funnel if you have not, trace any 
design you please on the glazed surface ; this makes a 
very handsome dish, and if your ham has been properly 
boiled will be very satisfactory to the palate. Of the 
boiling of ham I will speak in another chapter. 

I have a few more articles to recommend for your 
store-room, and then I think you will find yourself equal 
to the emergency of providing an elegant little meal if 
called upon unexpectedly, provided you have any cold 
scraps at all in the house, and maitre cThotel butter. 

To make the latter, take half a pound of fine butter, 
one tablespoonful of very fresh parsley, chopped not too 
fine, salt, pepper, and a small tablespoonful of lemon 
juice ; mix together, but do not w^ork more than suffi- 
cient for that purpose, and pack in a jar, keeping it in a 
cool place. A tablespoonful of this laid in a hot dish 
on which you serve beefsteak, chops, or any kind of fish, 
is a great addition, and turns plain boiled potatoes into 
pomme de terre a la maitre dlioteh It is excellent with 
stewed potatoes, or added to anything for which parsley 
is needed, and not always at hand ; a spoonful with half 
the quantity of flour stirred into a gill of milk or water 
makes the renowned maitre dliotel sauce (or English 



What to Have in Your Store-room. 33 

parsley butter) for boiled fish, rautton, or yeal. In 
short, it is one of the most valuable things to have in 
the house. Equally valuable, even, and more elegant is 
the preparation known as ^^ Ravigotte " or Montpellier 
butter. 

Take one i^ound in equal quantities of chervil, tarra- 
gon, burnet (pimpernel), chives, and garden cress (pep- 
pergrass) ; scald tico minutes, drain quite diy ; pound in 
a mortar three hard eggs, three anchovies, and one scant 
ounce of pickled cucumbers, and same quantity of capers 
well pressed to extract the vinegar ; add salt, pepper, and 
a bit of garlic half as large as a pea, rub all through a 
sieve ; then put a pound of fine butter into the mortar, 
which must be well cleansed from the herbs, add the 
herbs, with two tablespoonfuls of oil and one of tarragon 
vinegar, mix perfectly, and if not of a fine green, add 
the juice of some pounded spinach. 

This is the celebrated ^'heurre de Montpellier ^^^ sold 
in Paris in tiny jars at a high price. Ravigotte is the 
same thing, only in place of the eggs, anchovies, pickles, 
and capers, put half a pound more butter ; it is good, but 
less piquant. 

Pack in a jar, and keep cool. This butter is excel- 
lent for many purposes. For salad, beaten with oil, 
vinegar, and yolks of eggs, as for mayonnaise, it makes 
a delicious dressing. For cold meat or fish it is excel- 
lent, and also for chops. 

Two or three other articles serve to simplify the art of 
cooking in its especially difficult branches, and in the 
branches a lady finds difficult to attend to herself with- 
out remaining in the kitchen until the last minute before 
dinner ; but with the aid of blanc and roux a fairly 
intelligent girl can make excellent sauces. 



34 Culture and Cooking, 

For roux melt slowly half a pound of butter over the 
fire, skim it, let it settle, then dredge in eight ounces of 
fine flour, stir it till it is of a bright brown, then put 
away in a jar for use. 

Blanc is the same thing, only it is not allowed to 
brown ; it should be stirred only enough to make all hot 
through, then put away in a jar. 

If you need thickeniug for a white sauce and do not 
wish to stand over it yourself, having taught your cook 
the simple fact that a piece of blanc put into the milk 
lefore it boils (or it will harden instead of melt) and 
allowed to dissolve, stirring constantly, will make the 
sauce you wish, she will be able at all times to produce 
a white sauce that you need not be ashamed of. When 
the sauce is nearly ready to serve, stir in a good piece of 
butter — a large spoonful to half a pint ; when mixed, 
the sauce is ready. Brown sauce can always be made 
by taking a cup of broth or soup and dissolving in the 
same way a piece of the roux ; and also, if desired, a 
piece of Montpellier butter. If there is no soup of course 
you make it with a piece of glaze. 

Brown flour is also a convenient thing to have ready ; 
it is simply cooking flour in the oven until it is a pale 
brown ; if it is allowed to get dark it will be bitter, and, 
that it may brown evenly, it requires to be laid on a large 
flat baking pan and stirred often. Useful for thickening 
stews, hash, etc.

meal of cold meat or hash, or else a sort of early dinner, 
both of which are a mistake. If it is yeritably luncheon^ 
and not early dinner, it should be as unlike that later 
meal as possible for variety's sake, and, in any but very 
small families, there are so many dishes more suitable 
for luncheon than any other meal, that it is easy to 
have great variety with very little trouble. 

I wish it were more the fashion here to have many of 
the cold dishes which are popular on the other side the 
Atlantic ; and, in spite of the fact that table prejudices 
are very difficult to get over, I will append a few recipes 
in the hope that some lady, more progressive than prej- 
udiced, may give them a trial, convinced that their ex- 
cellence, appearance, and convenience will win them 
favor. 

By having most dishes cold at luncheon, it makes it a 
distinct meal from the hot breakfast and dinner. In 
summer, the cold food and a salad is especially refresh- 
ing ; in winter, a nice hot soup or puree— thick soup is 
preferable at luncheon to clear, which is well fitted to 
precede a heavy meal — and some savory entree are very 
desirable, while cold raised pie, galantine, jellied fish, and 
potted meats may ever, at that season, find their appro- 
priate place on the luncheon table. The potatoes, which 



36 Culture and Cooking. 

are the only vegetable introduced at strict lunch, should 
be prepared in some fancy manner, as croquettes, mashed 
and browned, a la mditre cT hotel, or in snow. The latter 
mode is pretty and novel ; I will, therefore, include it 
in my recipes for luncheon dishes. Omelets, too, are 
excellent at luncheon. 

In these remarks I am thinking especially of large 
families, whose luncheon table might be provided with 
a dish of galantine, one of collared fish, and a meat pie, 
besides the steak, cutlets, or warmed-over meat, without 
anything going to waste. In winter most cold jellied 
articles will keep a fortnight, and in summer three or 
four days. 

WiNDSOE Pie. — Take slices of veal cutlet, half an 
inch thick, and very thin slices of lean boiled ham ; put 
at the bottom of one of these veal-pie dishes or " bak- 
ers," about two to three inches deep, a layer of the veal, 
seasoned, then one of ham, then one of force-meat, made 
as follows : Take a little veal, or if you have sausage- 
meat ready-made, it will do, as much fine dry bread- 
crumbs, a dessert- spoonful of finely chopped parsley, in 
which is a salt-spoonful of powdered thyme, savory, and 
marjoram, if you have them, with salt and pepper, and 
mix with enough butter to make it a crumbling paste; 
lay a thin layer of this on the ham, then another of veal, 
then ham and force-meat again, until the dish is quite 
full. Lay something flat upon it, and then a weight for 
an hour. You must have prepared, from bones and 
scraps of veal, about a pint of stiff veal jelly ; pour this 
over the meat, and then take strips of rich puff paste 
(the hrioche paste would be excellent in hot weather), 
wet the edge of the dish, and lay the strips round, press- 
ing them lightly to the dish ; roll the cover a little 



Luncheon, 37 

larger than the top of the dish, and lay it on, first wet- 
ting the surface, not the edge, of the strips round the 
lips of the dish ; press the tAYO together, then make a hole 
in the center and ornament as you please ; but I never 
ornament the edge of a pie, as it is apt to prevent the 
paste from rising. An appropriate and simple ornament 
for meat pies is to roll a piece of paste very thin, cut it 
in four diamond-shaped pieces, put one point of each to 
the hole in the center so that you have one on each end, 
and one each side, then roll another little piece of paste 
as thin as possible, flour it and double it, then double it 
again, bring all the corners together in your hand, like 
a little bundle, then with a sharp knife give a quick cut 
over the top of the ball of paste, cutting quite deeply, 
then another across ; if your cut has been clean and 
quick, you will now be able to turn half back the leaves 
of paste as if it were a half-blown rose. The ends which 
you have gathered together in your hand are to be in- 
serted in the hole in the center of the pie. Then brush 
over with yolk of Qg^ beaten very well in a little milk or 
water, and bake an hour and a half. 

This way of covering and ornamenting a pie is ap- 
propriate for all meat pies ; pigeon pie should, however, 
have the little red feet skinned by dipping in boiling 
water, then rubbed in a cloth, when skin and nails peel 
off ; if allowed to lie in the water, the flesh comes too; 
then one pair is put at each end of the pie, a hole being 
cut to insert them, or four are put in the center instead 
of the rose. 

The Windsor pie is intended to be eaten cold, as are all 
veal and ham pies, the beauty of the jelly being lost in 
a hot pie. Do not fail to try it on that account, for 
cold pies are excellent things. 



38 Cidtiire and Cooking. 

Anothee yeal akd ham pie, more usual, and proba- 
bly the *^Tveal and hammer'^ that ^'mellered the organ" 
of Silas Wegg, was manufactured by Mrs. Boffin from 
this recipe ; it is as follows : 

Take the thick part of breast of yeal, remoying all the 
bones, which put on for grayy, stewing them long and 
slowly; put a layer of yeal, pepper and salt, then a thin 
sprinkling of ham; if boiled, cut in slices; if raw, cut a 
slice in dice, which scald before using, then more yeal 
and again ham. If force-meat balls are liked, make 
some force-meat as for Windsor pie, using if you prefer it 
chopped hard-boiled eggs in place of chopped meat, and 
binding into a paste with a raw Qgg ; then make into 
balls, which drop into the creyices of the pie ; boil two 
or three eggs quite hard, cut each in four and lay them 
round the sides and oyer the top, pour in about a gill of 
grayy, and coyer the same as the Windsor pie. In either 
of these pies the force-meat may be left out, a sweetbread 
cut up, or mushroons put in. 

A chicken pie to eat cold is yery fine made in this way. 

Kaised pork pies are so familiar to eyery one who has 
yisited England, and, in spite of the greasy idea, are so 
yery good, that I introduce a well-tried recipe, feeling 
sure anyone who eats pork at all will find it worth while 
to giyethem a trial; they will follow it with many another. 

The paste for them is made as follows : 

Eub into two pounds of flour a liberal half pound of 
butter, then melt in half a pint of hot, but not boiling 
milk, another half pound — or it may be lard; pour this 
into the flour, and knead it into a smooth, firm paste. 
Properly raised pies should be molded by hand, and I will 
endeayor to describe the method in case any persever- 
ing lady would like to try and haye the orthodox thing. 



Luncheon, 43 

Potted meats are a great resource to English house- 
keepers ; this side the Atlantic they are chiefly known 
through the medium of Cross & Blackwell, though lat- 
terly one or two American firms have introduced some 
very admirable articles of the sort. Home-made potted 
meats are, however, better and less expensive than those 
bought ; they should be packed away in jars, Liebig's 
extract of meat jars not being too small for the j^urpose, 
as, while covered with the fat they keep well ; once 
opened, they require eating within a week or ten days, 
except in very cold weather. 

Potted bloater is one of the least expensive and appe- 
tizing of all potted meats. To make it, take two or three 
or more bloaters, cut off the heads and cleanse them, put 
them in the oven long enough to cook them through; 
take them out, take off the skin, and remove the meat 
from the bones carefully ; put the meat of the fish in a 
jar with half its weight of butter, leave it to slowly cook 
in a cool oven for an hour, then take it out, put the fish 
into a mortar or strong dish, pour the batter on it care- 
fully, but don't let the gravy pass too, unless the fish is 
to be eaten very quickly, as it would prevent it keej^ing. 
Beat both butter and fish till they form a paste, add a 
little cayenne, and press it into small pots, pouring on 
each melted butter, or mutton suet. Either should be 
the third of an inch thick on the bloater. This makes 
excellent sandwiches. 

Potted Ham.— Take any remains of ham you have, 
even fried, if of a nice quality, is good for the purpose ; 
take away all stringy parts, sinew, or gristle, put it in a 
slow oven with its weight of butter, let it stay macerat- 
ing in the butter till very tender, then beat it in a mor- 
tar, add cayenne, and pack in j^ots in the same way as 



44 Culture arid Cooking. 

the bloater. Thus you may pot odds and ends of any 
meat or fish you have, and as a little potted meat goes a 
long way, when you have a little lobster, a bit of chicken 
breast, or even cold veal, I advise j'Ou to use it in this 
way ; you will then have a little stock of dainties in the 
house to fall back on at any time for unexpected calls — 
a very important thing in the country. 

Potted chicken or veal requires either a little tongue 
or lean ham to give flavor ; but failing these, a little 
ravigotte butter, beaten in after the meat is well 
pounded, is by no means a bad substitute. 

Many people like the flavor of anchovies, but do not 
like the idea of eating raw fish ; for these anchovy but- 
ter is very acceptable. 

Take the anchovies out of the liquor in which they are 
packed, but do not wash them, put them in twice their 
weight of butter in a jar, which stand in boiling water ; 
set all back of the stove for an hour, then pound, add 
cayenne, and pack in glasses. 

Unexpected company to luncheon with a lady who has 
to eat that meal alone generally, and (as is the unwise 
way of such ladies) makes it a very slender meal, is one 
of the ordeals of a young housekeeper ; company to lunch 
and nothing in the house. But there is generally a 
dainty luncheon in every house if you know how to pre- 
pare it ; there certainly always will be if you keep your 
store-room supplied with the things I have named. Let 
the table be prettily laid at all times, then if you have 
potted meat and preserves, have them put on the table. 
Are there cold potatoes? If so cut them up into potato 
salad, if they are whole ; if broken, warm them in a 
wine-glass of milk, a teaspoonful of flour, and a piece 
as large as an ^%g of maitre dliotel butter. Have you 



Luncheon, 45 

sucli scraps of cold meat as could not come to table? Toss 
them up with a half cup of water, a slice of glaze (oh, 
blessed ever-ready glaze!) a teaspoonful of ravigotte, or 
maitre dlwtel, and a teaspoonful of roux or blanc, ac- 
cording as your meat is light or dark, season, and serve. 
Or you have no meat, then you have eggs, and what bet- 
ter than an omelet and such an omelet as the following:? 
Take the crumb of a slice of bread, soak it in hot milk 
(cold will do, but hot is better), beat up whites of four 
eggs to a high froth; mix the bread with all the milk it 
will absorb, no 7nore, into a paste, add the yolks of eggs 
with a little salt, set the pan on the fire with an ounce of 
butter. Let it get very hot, then mix the whites of eggs 
with the yolks and bread lightly, pour in the pan, and 
move about for a minute ; if the oven is hot, when the 
omelet is brown underneath, set the pan in the oven 
for five minutes, or until the top is set ; then double 
half over, and serve. If your guests have a liking for 
sweets, and your potted meats supply the savory part of 
your luncheon, then have a brown gravy ready to serve 
with it. Put into a half cup of boiling water a slice of 
glaze, a spoonful of roux, and enough Harvey sauce, or 
mushroom ^oowder, to flavor. If your omelet is to be 
sweet, before you fold it put in a layer of preserves. 

The advantage of the omelet I have here given is 
that it keeps plnmp and tender till cold, so that five 
minutes of waiting does not turn it into leather, the 
great objection with omelets generally. 

Potatoes for luncheon, as I have said, should always 
be prepared in some fancy w^ay, and snow is a very pretty 
one. Have some fine mealy potatoes boiled, carefully 
poured off, and set back of the stove with a cloth over 
them till they are quite dry and fall apart ; then have a 



46 Culture and Cooking. 

colander, or coarse wire sieye made liot and a liot dish in 
wliicli to serve them, pass the floury potatoes through 
the sieve, taking care not to crush the snow as it falls. 
You require a large dish heaping full, and be careful 
it is kept hot. 

This mode of preparing potatoes, although very jDretty 
and novel, must never be attempted with any but the 
whitest and mealiest kind. 

The remains of cold potatoes may be ^irepared thus: 
Put three ounces of butter in a frying-j^an in which fry 
three onions sliced till tender, but not very brown, then 
put on the potatoes cut in slices, and shake them till 
they are of a nice brown color, put a spoonful of chopped 
parsley, salt, pepper, and juice of a lemon, shake well 
that all may mix together, dish, and serve very hot. 



CHAPTER VI. 

A CHAPTER Oi^ GENERAL MAXAGEMEXT 12^ YERY 
SMALL FAMILIES. 

A TERY small family, ^'a young menage, ^^ for in- 
stance, is very much more difficult to cater for without 
waste than a larger one; two people are so apt to get tired 
of anything, be it ever so good eating, when it has been 
on the table once or twice; therefore it would be useless 
to make galantine or the large pies I have indicated, ex- 
cept for occasions when guests are expected ; but, as I 
hope to aid young housekeepers to have nice dishes when 
alone, I will devote this chapter to their needs. 

The chapter on " Warming Over " will be very useful 
also to this large class. 

In the first place it is well to have regard, when part 
of a dish leaves the table, as to whether it, or any partic- 
ular part of it, will make a nice little cold dish, or a re- 
chauffe; in that case have it saved, unless it is required 
for the servants' dinner (it is well to manage so that it is 
not needed for that purpose); for instance, if there is the 
wing and a slice or two of the breast of a chicken left, it 
Avill make a dainty little breakfast dish, or cold, in jelly, 
be nice for lunch. There is always jelly if you have 
roast chicken, if you manage properly, and this is how 
you do it : 

Carefully save the feet, throat, gizzard, and liver of 
your chickens; scald the feet by pouring boiling water 

47 



48 Cult lire and Cooking, 

over them; leave them just a minute, and pull off the 
outer skin and nails; they come away very readily, leav- 
ing the feet delicately white; put these with the other 
giblets, properly cleansed, into a small saucepan with an 
onion, a slice of carrot, a sprig of parsley, and a pint of 
water (if you have the giblets of one chicken), if of 
two, put a quart; let this slowly simmer for two hours 
and a half; it will be reduced to about half, and form a 
stiff jelly when cold; a glass of sherry, and squeeze of 
lemon, or teaspoonful of tarragon vinegar, makes this 
into a delicious aspic, and should be added if to be eaten 
cold. The jelly must of course be strained. 

In roasting chickens, if you follow the rule for meat, 
that is, put no water in the pan, but a piece of butter, and 
dredge a very little flour over the chicken, you will have 
a nice brown glaze at the bottom of the pan, provided 
it has been cooked in a quick oven; if in a cool oven 
there will be nothing brown at all ; but we will suppose 
the bird is browned to a turn ; pour your gravy from the 
giblets into the pan, take off every bit of the glaze or 
osmazone that adheres, and let it dissolve, rubbing it 
with the back of the spoon ; then, if you are likely to 
have any chicken left cold, pour off a little gravy in a 
cup through a fine strainer, leaving in your pan suffi- 
cient for the dinner ; in this mash up the liver till it is 
a smooth paste which thickens the gravy, and serve. 
Some object to liver, therefore the use of it is a matter 
of taste. If you dress the chickens English fashion, you 
will need the liver and gizzard to tuck under the wings ; 
in this case, stew only the feet and throat, using a little 
meat of any kind, if you have it, to take their place ; 
but on no account fail to use the feet, as they are as rich 
in jelly as calves' feet in proportion to their size. 



General Management in Small Families. 49 

The jelly laid aside will be enough to ornament and 
give relish to a little dish of cold chicken, and changes 
it from a dry and commonplace thing to a recherche one. 
If two chickens are cooked it is more economical than 
one ; there is, then, double the amount of gravy, gener- 
ally sufficient, if you lay some very nice pieces of cold 
chicken in a bowl, to pour over it and leave it enveloped 
in jelly ; you still then, if from dinner for two people, 
have perhaps joints enough to make a dish of curry or 
fricassee, or any of the many ways in which cold chicken 
may be used, for which see chapter on ^'Warming OverJ'^ 

For small households large joints are to be avoided, 
but even a small roast is a large joint when there are but 
two or three to eat it. For this reason it is a good plan 
to buy such joints as divide well. A sirloin of beef is 
better made into two fine dishes than into one roast, 
and then warmed over twice. Every one knows that 
'^ Filet lie hceitf Chateauhriand^^ is one of the classical 
dishes of the French table, that to a Frenchman luxury 
can go no further ; but every one does not know how 
entirely within his power it is to have that dish as often 
as he has roast beef ; how convenient it would be to so 
have it. Here it is : When your sirloin roast comes from 
the butcher, take out the tenderloin or fillets, which you 
must always choose thick ; cut it across into steaks an 
inch thick, trim them, cover them with a coat of butter 
(or oil, which is much better), and broil them ten min- 
utes, turning them often ; garnish with fried potatoes, 
and serve with sauce Chateaubriand, as follows : Put a 
gill of white wine (or claret will do if you have no 
white) into a saucepan, with a piece of glaze, weighing 
an ounce and a half ; add three quarters of a pint of 
espagnole, and simmer fifteen minutes ; when ready to 
3 



50 Culture and Cooking. 

serve, thicken with two ounces of maltre dlwtel butter 
in which a dessert-spoonful of flour has been worked. 
That is how Jules Gouffu's recipe runs ; but, as no small 
family will keep espagnole ready made, allow a little more 
glaze (of course the recipe as given may be divided to 
half or quarter, provided the correct proportions are 
retained), and use a tablespoonful of roux and i\\Qmaitre 
dlwtel butter, both of which you have probably in your 
store-room ; if not, brown a little flour, chop some pars- 
ley, and add to two ounces of butter ; work them to- 
gether, then let them dissolve in the sauce, for which 
purpose let it go off the boil ; let the sauce simmer a 
minute, skim, and serve. 

The sirloin of beef, denuded of its fillet, is still a good 
roast ; and as you can't have your cake and eat it too, 
and hot fresh roast beef is better than the same warmed 
over, warm ye never so wisely, I think this i^lan may 
commend itself to those who like nice little dinners. 

A nice little dinner of a soup, an entree, or made dish, 
salad, and dessert, really costs no more than frequent 
roast meat, or even steak and pudding, by following 
some such plan as this : 

Sunday. — Pot-aic-feu and roast lamb, leg of mutton 
or other good joint, etc. 

Monday. — Rice or vermicelli soup made with remains 
of the houillon from pot-au-feu. If the Sunday joint 
was a fore or hindquarter of lamb it should have been 
divided, say the leg from the loin, thus providing choice 
roasts for two days, and yet having enough cold lamb — 
that favorite dish with so many — for luncheon with a sal- 
ad ; and, surprising to say, after hot roast lamb for dinner 
Sunday, cold lunch for Monday, another roast Monday, 
and cold or Avarmed up for lunch Tuesday, there will 



General Management in Small Families. 51 

still be (supposing as I do, in preparing this chapter, 
that the family consists only of gentleman, lady, and ser- 
vant) remains enough from the two cold joints to make 
cromesquis of lamb (see recipe), a little dish of mince, or 
a delicate scmtd of lamb for breakfast. It is surprising 
what may be done with odds and ends in a small fam- 
ily ; a tiny plate of pieces, far too small to make an ap- 
pearance on the table, and which, if special directions 
are not given, will seem to Bridget not worth saving, 
will, with each piece dipped into the batter a la Careme, 
and fried in hot fat, make a tempting dish for breakfast, 
or an entree for dinner or luncheon. Two tablespoonfuls 
only of chopped meat of any kind will make croquettes 
for two or three people ; hence, ' save the pieces.' But 
to return to our bills of fare : I have given the two roasts 
of lamb for consecutive days, because the weather in 
lamb season is usually too warm to keep it ; when this 
can be done, however, it is pleasanter to leave the second 
joint of lamb till Tuesday. Should a forequarter (abroad 
held in greater esteem than the hindquarter) have been 
chosen, get the butcher to take out the shoulder in one 
round thick joint, English fashion ; this crisply roasted 
is far more delicious than the leg ; you then have the 
chops to be breaded, and an excellent dish of the neck 
and breast, either broiled, curried, stewed with peas, or 
roast. 

Yet how often we see a whole quarter of lamb put in 
the oven for two or three peojile who get tired of the 
sight of it cold, yet feel in economy bound to eat it. 

Should sirloin of beef have been the Sunday dinner, 
you will know what to do with it, from directions al- 
ready given; and as a sirloin of beef, even with the fillet 
out, will be more than required for one dinner, it may 



52 Culture and Cooking, 

serve for a third day, dressed in one of the various ways 
I shall give in chapter on "Warming Over." You have 
still at your disposal the bouilli or beef from which you 
have made your jjot-au-feu, which, if it has been care- 
fully boiled, not galloped, nor allowed to fall to rags, is 
very good eating. Cut thin with lettuce, or in winter 
celery, in about equal quantities, and a good salad dress- 
ing, it is excellent; or, made into hash, fritadella, or even 
rissoles, is savory and delicious ; only bear in mind with 
this, as all cooked meats, the gravy drawn out must be 
replaced by stock or glaze ; it is very easy to warm over 
bouilli satisfactorily, as a cup of the soup made from it 
can always be kept for gravy. 

A leg of mutton makes tAvo excellent joints, and is 
seldom liked cold — as beef and lamb often are. 

Select a large fine leg, have it cut across, that each 
part may weigh about equally; roast the thick or fillet end 
and serve with or without onion sauce (« la souhise) ; 
boil the knuckle in a small quantity of water, just 
enough to cover it, with a carrot, turnip, onion, and 
bunch of parsley, and salt in the water, serve with caper 
sauce and mashed turnips. The broth from this is ex- 
cellent soup served thus : Skim it carefully, take out 
the vegetables, and chop a small quantity of parsley very 
fine, then beat up in a bowl two eggs, pour into them a 
little of the broth — not boiling— beating all the time, 
then draw your soup back till it is off the boil, and pour 
in the eggs, stirring continually till it is on the boiling 
point again (but it must not boil, or the eggs will cur- 
dle and spoil the soup), and then turn it into a hot tureen 
and serve. Use remains of the cold roast and boiled mut- 
ton together, to make made dishes; between the days of 
having the roast and boiled mutton jou may have had a 



General Management in Small Families. 53 

fowl, and the remains from tliat will make you a second 
dish to go with your joint. 

The remains from the first cooked mutton, in form 
of curry, mince, salmi, or saute, will be a second dish 
with your fowl. 

Veal is one of the most convenient things to have for 
a small family, as it warms over in a variety of ways, and. 
in some is actually better than when put on the table as 
a joint. By having a little fish one day, instead of soup, 
and a little game another, and remembering when you 
have an especially dainty thing, to have one with it a 
little more substantial and less costly, you may have vari- 
ety at little expense. 

For instance, if you find it convenient to have for din- 
ner fritadelle (see ^^ Warming Over^^) or miroton of beef, 
or cold mutton curried, you might have broiled birds, or 
roast pigeon, or game. In this consists good manage- 
ment, to live so that the expenses of one day balance 
those of the other — unless you are so happily situated 
that expense is a small matter, in which case these re- 
marks will not apply to you at all. Then, never mind 
warming over, or making one joint into two; let your 
poor neighbors and Bridget's friends enjoy your superflu- 
ity. To the woman with a moderate income it usually 
is a matter of importance, or ought to be, that her 
weekly expenditure should not exceed a certain amount, 
and for this she must arrange that any extra expense is 
balanced by a subsequent economy. 

Salads add much to the health and elegance of a din- 
ner ; it is in early spring an expensive item if lettuce is 
used; but no salad can be more delicious or more health- 
ful than dressed celery; and by buying when cheap, ar- 
ranging with a man to lay in your cellar, covered with 



54 Culture and Cooking. 

soil, enough for the winter's use, it need cost but moder- 
ately. Celeraic, or turnip-rooted celery is another salad 
that is very popular with our German friends; it is a 
bulbous celery, the root being the part eaten ; these are 
cooked like potatoes, cut in slices, and dressed with oil 
and yinegar, or mayonnaise, it is exceedingly good. 
Potato salad is always procurable, and in summer at 
lunch, instead of the hot vegetable, or in winter when 
green salad is dear, is very valuable. It may be varied 
by the addition, one day, of a few chopped pickles, an- 
other, a little onion, or celery, or parsley, or tarragon, a 
little ravigotte butter beaten to cream with the vinegar, 
or with meat, as follows : Boil the potatoes in their skins, 
peel them, cut them into pieces twice the thickness- 
of a fifty-cent piece, and put them into a salad bowl with 
cold meat (bouilli from soup is excellent) ; put to them 
a teaspoonful of salt, half that quantity of pepper, two 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, three or even four of oil, and 
a teaspoonful of chopped parsley. You can vary this by 
putting at different times some chopped celery or pickles, 
olives, or anchovies. 



CHAPTEE VII. 

OK FRTIXG AJs'D BKOILIXG. 

Fryij^g is one of the operations in cookery in whicli 
there are more failures than any other, or, at least, there 
appear to be more, because the failure is always so yery 
apparent. Nothing can make a dish of breaded cutlets 
on which are bald white spots look inviting, or livid- 
looking fish, just flaked here and there with the bread 
that has been persuaded to stay on. And, provided you 
have enough fat in the pan— there should always be 
enough to immerse the article ; therefore use a deep iron 
or enameled pan — there can be but two reasons why you 
fail. Your fat has not been hot enough, or your crumbs 
have not been fine and even. 

Many suppose when the fat bubbles and boils in the 
pan that it is quite hot ; it is far from being so. Others 
again are so much nearer the truth that they know it 
must become silent, that is, boil and cease to boil, before 
it is ready, but even that is not enough; it must be silent 
some time, smoke, and appear to be on the point of burn- 
ing, then drop a bit of bread in; if it crisps and takes 
color directly, quickly put in your articles. 

These articles, whether cutlets or fish, must have been 
carefully prepared, or herein may lie the second cause of 
failure. Any cookery book will give you directions how 
to crumb, follow them ; but what some do not tell you 
is, that your bread-crumbs should be finely sifted; every

coarse crumb is liable to drop off and bring with it a 
good deal of the surrounding surface. 

I also follow the French plan in using the ^gg, and 
mix with it oil and water in the proportion of three 
eggs, one tablespoonful of oil, one of water, and a little 
salt, beat together and use. It is a good plan to keep a 
supply of panure or dried bread-crumbs always ready. 
Cut any slices of baker's bread, dry them in a cool oven 
so that they remain quite colorless, or they will not do 
for the purpose. When as dry as crackers, crush under 
a rolling-pin, and sift ; keep in a jar for use. 

In no branch of cooking is excellence more appreci- 
ated than in that of frying. A dish of filets de sole or 
cutlets, crisp and golden brown, is an ornament to any 
table, and is seldom disdained by any one. Apropos of 
filets de sole; it is very high-sounding yet very attainable, 
as I shall show. I was staying with a friend early in 
spring, a lady always anxious for table novelties. *^ Oh, 
do tell me what fish to order, I should like something 
fried, now that you are here to tell cook how to do it ; 
she hasn't the wildest idea, although she would be 
astounded to hear me say so." "Have you ever 
had flounders ?" I asked. " Flounders !" My friend's 
pretty nose went up the eighth of an inch, and her con- 
fidence in my powers as counselor went down to zero. 
" Flounders ! but they are a very common fish you 
know." "I know they are very delicious," I answered. 
" Order them, and trust me ; but I must coax the 
autocrat of your kitchen to allow me to cook and pre- 
pare them myself." 

An hour before dinner I went into the kitchen, put 
at least a pound of lard into a deep frying-pan, and 
set it where it would get gradually hot, then I turned 



On Frying and Broiling. 57 

my attention to the fish ; they were thick, firm floun- 
ders, and were ready cleaned, scraped, and the heads 
off. I then proceeded to bone one in the following 
way : Take a sharp knife and split the flounder right 
down the middle of the back, then run the knife care- 
fully between the flesh and bones going toward the edge. 
You have now detached one quarter of the flesh from 
the bone, do the other half in the same way, and when 
the back is thus entirely loose from the bone, turn the 
fish oyer and do the same with the other part. You will 
now find you can remove the bone whole from the fish, 
detaching, as you do so, any flesh still retaining the 
bone, then you have two halves of the fish ; cut away 
the fins, and you have four quarters of solid fish. Now 
see if the fat is very hot, set it forward while you wipe 
your fish dry, and dip each i^iece in milk, then in flour. 
Try if the fat is hot by dropping a crumb into it ; if it 
browns at once, put in the fish. When they are beauti- 
fully brown, which will be in about ten minutes, take 
them up in the colander, and then lay them on a towel 
to absorb any fat, lay them on a hot dish, and garnish 
with slices of lemon and parsley or celery tops. 

N"ow when this dish made its appearance, my friend's 
husband, a ton vivant, greeted it with, *^Aha! Filets 
de sole d, la Dehnonico,^^ and as nothing to the con- 
trary was said until dinner was over, he ate them under 
the impression that they were veritable filets de sole. 
Of course I can't pretend to say whether M. Delmonico 
imports his soles, or uses the homely flounder ; but I do 
know that one of his frequenters knew no difference. 

Oysters should be laid on a cloth to drain thoroughly, 
then rolled in fine sifted cracker dust, and dropped into 
very hot fat; do not put more oysters in the pan than

will fry without one overlapping the other. Very few 
minutes will brown them beautifully, if your fat was hot 
enough, and as a minute too long toughens and shrinks 
them, be very careful that it browns -a cube of bread al- 
most directly, before you begin the oysters. Egg and 
bread-crumb may be used instead of cracker dust, but it 
is not the proper thing, and is a great deal more trouble. 
Should you be desirous of using it, however, the oysters 
must be carefully wiped dry before dipping them; while 
for cracker dust they are not wiped, but only drained 
well. 

Fish of any kind, fried in batter a la Careme. (see 
recipe), is very easy to do, and very nice. 

Carefully save veal, lamb, beef, and pork dripj^ings. 
Keep a crock to put it in, and, clarified as I shall direct, 
it is much better than lard for many purposes, and for 
frying especially ; it does not leave the dark look that is 
sometimes seen on articles fried in lard. The perfection 
of ^^friture," or frying-fat, according to Gouffe, is equal 
parts of lard and beef fat melted together. 

Yet there are families where dripping is never used — 
is looked upon as unfit to use — while the truth is that 
many persons quite unable to eat articles fried in lard 
would find no inconvenience from those fried in beef fat. 
It is as wholesome as butter, and far better for the 
purpose. Butter, indeed, is only good for frying such 
things as omelets or scrambled eggs ; things that are 
cooked in a very short time, and require no great degree 
of heat. 

The same may be said of oil, than which, for fish, 
nothing can be better. Yet it can only be used once, 
and is unsuitable for things requiring long-sustained 
heat, as it soon gets bitter and rank. 



On Frying and Broiling, 59 

Do not be afraid to put a pound or two of fat in your 
pan for frying ; it is quite as economical as to put less 
for it can be used over and over again, a pail or crock 
being kept for the purpose of receiying it. Always in 
returning it to the crock pour it through a fine strainer, 
so that no sediment or brown particles may pass which 
would spoil the next frying. 

To clarify dripping, when poured from the meat-23an, 
it should go into a bowl, instead of the crock in which 
you wish to keej) it. Then pour into the bowl also some 
boiling water, and add a little salt, stir it, and set it 
away. Kext day, or when cold, run a knife round the 
bowl, and (unless it is pork) it will turn out in a solid 
cake, leaving the water and impurities at the bottom. 
Now scrape the bottom of your dripping, and put it in 
more boiling water till it melts, then stir again, another 
pinch of salt add, and let it cool again. When you take 
off the cake of fat, scrape it as before, and it is ready to 
be melted into the general crock, and will now keep for 
months in cool weather. If you are having frequent 
joints it is as well to do all your dripping together, once 
a week ; but do not leave it long at any season with wa- 
ter under it, as that would taint it. Fat skimmed from 
boiled meat, pot-au-feu, before the vegetables, etc., go 
in, is quite as good as that from roast, treated in the 
same way. 

Frying in batter is very easy and excellent for some 
things, such as warming over meat, being far better 
than eggs and crumbs. Careme gives the following 
recipe, which is excellent : 

Three quarters of a pound of sifted flour, mixed with 
two ounces of butter melted in warm water ; blow the 
butter off the water into the flour first, then enough of 



6o Culture and Cooking. 

the water to make a soft paste, which beat smooth, then 
more warm water till it is batter thick enough to mask 
the back of a spoon dipped into it, and salt to taste ; add 
the last tiling the whites of two eggs well beaten. 

Another batter, called a la Provenqale, is also exceed- 
ingly good, especially for articles a little dry in them- 
selves, such as chickens to be warmed over, slices of cold 
veal, etc. 

Take same quantity of flour, two yolks of eggs, four 
tablespoonfuls of oil, mix with cold water, and add 
whites of eggs and salt as before. Into this batter I 
sometimes put a little chopped parsley, and the least bit 
of powdered thyme, or grated lemon-peel, or nutmeg ; 
this is, however, only a matter of taste. 

BKOiLiis'G is the simplest of all forms of cooking, and 
is essentially English. To broil well is very easy with 
a little attention. A brisk clear fire, not too high in 
the stove, is necessary to do it with ease ; yet if, as 
must sometimes happen, to meet the necessities of other 
cooking, your fire is very large, carefully fix the gridiron 
on two briclvs or in any convenient manner, to prevent 
the meat scorching, then have the gridiron very liot be- 
fore putting your meat upon it ; turn it, if chop or 
steak, as soon as the gravy begins to start on the upper 
side ; if allowed to remain without turning long, the 
gravy forms a pool on the top, which, when turned, falls 
into the fire and is lost ; the action of the heat, if turned 
quickly, seals the pores and the gravy remains in the 
meat. If the fire is not very clear, put a cover over the 
meat on the gridiron, it will prevent its blackening or 
burning — if the article is thick I always do so— and it is 
an especially good plan with birds or chickens, which 
are apt to be raw at the joints unless this is done ; in- 



On Frying and Broiling, 6 1 

deed, with the latter, I think it a good way to put them 
in a hot oven ten minutes before they go on to broil, 
then have a spoonful of mditre cT hotel butter to lay on 
the breast of each. Young spring chickens are some- 
times very dry, in which case dip them in melted but- 
ter, or, better still, oil them all over a little while be- 
fore cooking. There is nothing more unsightly than a 
sprawling dish of broiled chickens ; therefore, in prejoar- 
ing them place them in good form, then, with a gentle 
blow of the rolling-pin, break the bones that they may 
remain so. 



CHAPTER VIII. 

BOASTING. 

Ik spite of Brillat-Savarin's maxim that one may be- 
come a cook, but must be born a rotisseiir, I am inclined 
to think one may also, by remembering one or two 
things, become a very good "roaster" (to translate the 
untranslatable), especially in our day, when the oven has 
taken the place of the spit, although a great deal of 
meat is spoiled in roasting ; a loin of lamb or piece of 
beef, that comes to the table so pale that you can't tell 
whether it has been boiled or merely wilted in the oven, 
is an aggravation so familiar, that a rich brown, well- 
roasted joint is generally a surprise. Perhaps the cook 
will tell you she has had the "hottest kind of an oven;" 
but then she has probably also had a w^ll of water 
underneath it, the vapor from which, arising all the 
time, has effectually soddened the meat, and checked 
the browning. The surface of roast meat should be 
covered with a rich glaze, scientifically called "osma- 
zone." That the meat may be thus glazed, it should 
always go into a liot oven, so that, as the gravy exudes, 
it may congeal on the outside, thus sealing up the pores. 
The general plan, however, is to put meat into a warm 
oven an hour or two earlier than it should go, with a 
quantity of water and flour underneath it. The result in 
hot weather I have known to be very disagreeable, the 
tepid oven having, in fact, given a stale taste to the joint 

62 



CHAPTER IX. 

BOILING. 

BoiLiXG is one of the things about which cooks are 
most careless ; theoretically they almost always know 
meat should be slowly boiled, but their idea of ^^slow " is 
ruled by the fire ; they never attempt to rule that. There 
is a good rule given by Gouffe as to what slow boiling 
actually is : the surface of the pot should only show 
signs of ebullition at one side, just an occasional bubble. 
Simmering is a still slower process, and in this the pot 
should have only a sizzling round one part of the edge. 
All fresh meat should boil slmvly ; ham or corn beef 
should barely simmer. -Yet they must not go off the 
boil at all, which would spoil fresh meat entirely ; steep- 
ing in water gives a flat, insipid taste. 

All vegetables except potatoes, asparagus, peas, and 
cauliflower should boil as fast as possible ; these four 
only moderately. Most vegetables are boiled far too long. 
Cabbage is as delicate as cauliflower in the summer and 
fall if boiled in plenty of water, to wliich a salt spoon- 
ful of soda has been added, as fast as possible for twenty 
minutes or half an hour, then drained and dressed. In 
winter it should be cut in six or eight pieces, hoiled fast, 
in plenty of water, for half an hour, no longer. Always 
give it plenty of room, let the water boil rapidly when 
you put it in the joot, which set on the hottest part of. 

65 ^X. 




^^ Culture and Cooking. 

the JBre to come to that point again, and you will have no 
more strong, rank, yellow stuff on your table, no bad odor 
inyour house. Peas require no more than twenty minutes' 
boiling if young ; asparagus the same ; the latter should 
always be boiled in a saucepan deep enough to let it 
stand up in the water when tied up in bunches, for this 
saves the heads. Potatoes should be poured off the 
minute they are done, and allowed to stand at the back of 
the stove with a clean cloth folded over them. They are 
the only vegetable that should be put into cold water. 
When new, boiling water is proper. When quite ripe 
they are more floury if put in cold water. 

Soups. — As I have before said, I do not pretend to give 
many recipes, only to tell you how to succeed with the 
recipes given in other books. I shall, therefore, only 
give one recipe which I laiow is a novelty and one for the 
foundation of all soups. In one sense I have done the 
latter already. The stock for glaze is an excellent soup 
before it is reduced ; but I will also give Jules Gouffe's 
method of making pot-au-feu, it being a most beautifully 
clear soup. 

It often haj)pens, however, that you have sufficient 
stock from bones, trimmings of meat, and odds and ends 
of gravies, which may always be turned to account ; but 
the stock from such a source, although excellent, will 
not always be clear ; therefore, you must proceed with it 
in the following manner, unless you wish to use it for 
thick soup : 

Make your stock boiling hot and skim well ; then have 
ready the whites of three eggs (I am supposing you 
have three quarts of stock — one Qg^ to a quart), to which 
add half a pint of cold water ; whisk well together ; then 
add half a pint of the boiling stock gradually, still whisk- 



Boiling, 6^ 

ing the eggs ; then stir the boiliug stock rapidly, pouring 
in the whites of eggs, etc. ; as you do it, stir quickly till 
nearly boiling again, then take it from the fire, let it re- 
main till the whites of eggs separate ; then strain through 
a clean, fine cloth into a basin. This rule once learned 
will clear eyerykind of soup or jelly. 

There are many people who are good cooks, yet fail in 
clear soup, which is with them semi-opaque, while it 
should be like sherry. The cause of this opacity is gen- 
erally quick boiling while the meat is in. This gives it 
a milky appearance. After the stock is once made and 
clear, quick boiling will do no harm, but of course wastes 
the soup, unless resorted to for the purpose of making it 
stronger. A word here about coloring soup : Most per- 
sons resort to burnt sugar, and, very carefully used, it is 
not at all a bad makeshift. But how often have we a 
rich-looking soup put before us, the vermicelli appear- 
ing to repose under a lake of strong russet hoicillon, but 
which, on tasting, we find suggestive of nothing but 
burnt sugar and salt, every bit of flavor destroyed by the 
acrid coloring. Sometimes stock made by the recipe for 
pot-au-feic (to follow) requires no color ; this depends 
on the beef ; but usually all soup is more appetizing in 
appearance for a little browning, and for this purpose I 
always use burnt onions in preference to anything else. 
If you have none in store when the soup is put on, put 
a small onion in the oven (or on the back of the stove ; 
should you be baking anything the odor would taint) ; 
turn it often till it gets quite black, but not charrecL 
Then put it to the soup ; it adds a fine flavor as well as 
color, and you need not fear overdoing it. 

Soup that is to be reduced must be very lightly salted; 
for this reason salt is left out altogether for glaze, as the 



68 Culture and Cooking, 

reduction causes the water only to evaporate, the salt 
remains. 

Gouffe's Pot-au-Feu. — Four pounds of lean beef, 
six quarts of water, six ounces of carrot, six of turnip, 
six of onion, half an ounce of celery, one clove, salt. 

Put the meat on in cold water, and just before it 
comes to the boil skim it, and throw in a wineglass of 
cold water, skim again, and, when it is ''on the boil," 
again throw in another wineglass of cold water ; do this 
two or three times. The object of adding the cold water 
is to keep it just off the boil until all the scum has risen, 
as the boiling point is when it comes to the surface, yet 
once having boiled, the scum is broken uj^, and the soup 
is never so clear. 

The meat must simmer slowh^, not toil, for three 
hours before the vegetables are added, then for a couple 
of hours more. 

It is necessary to be very exact in the proportions of 
vegetables ; but, of course, after having weighed them for 
soups once or twice, you will get to know about the size 
of a carrot, turnip, etc., that will weigh six ounces. 
The exact weight is given until the eye is accustomed 
to it. 

This soup strained, and boiled down to one half, be- 
comes consomme. 

Celery Ceeam is a most delicious and little-known 
white soup, and all lovers of good things will thank me 
for introducing it. 

Have some nice veal stock, or the water in which 
chickens have been boiled, reduced till it is rich enough, 
will do, or some very rich mutton broth, but either of 
the former are preferable ; then put on a half cup of rice 
in a pint of rich milk, and grate into it the white part 



Boili?tg, 69 

and root of two heads of celery. Let the rice milk cook 
very slo^yly at the back of the stove, adding more milk 
before it gets at all stiff ; when tender enough to mash 
through a coarse sieve or fine colander add it to the 
stock, which must have been strained and be quite 
free from sediment, season with salt and a little white 
pepper or cayenne, boil all together gently a few min- 
utes. It should look like rich cream, and be strongly 
flavored with celery. Of course the quantity of rice, 
milk, and celery must depend on the quantity of stock 
you have. I have given the proportion for one quart, 
which, with the milk, etc., added, would make about 
three pints of soup. 



CHAPTER X. 

SAUCES. 

Talletrakd said England was a country with twen- 
ty-four religions and only one sauce. He might have 
said two sauces, and he would have been literally right 
as regards both England and America. Everything is 
served with brown sauce or white sauce. And how 
often the white sauce is like bookbinder's paste, the 
brown, a bitter, tasteless brown mess ! Strictly speak- 
ing, 23erhaps, the French have but two sauces either, 
espagnole, or brown sauce, and white sauce, which they 
call the mother sauces ; but what changes they ring on 
these mother sauces ! The espagnole once made, with no 
two meats is it served alike in flavor, and in this matter 
of flavor the artist appears. In making brown sauce for 
any purpose, bethink yourself of anything there may be 
in your store-room with which to vary its flavor, taking 
care that it shall agree with the meat for which it is in- 
tended. The ordinary cook flies at once to Worcester- 
shire or Harvey sauce, which are excellent at times, but 
'' toujour s perdrix " is not always welcome. A pinch of 
mushroom powder, or a few chopped oysters, are excel- 
lent with beef or veal ; so will be a sj^oonful of Montpel- 
lier butter stirred in, or curry, not enough to yellow the 
sauce, but enough to give a dash of piquancy. A pic- 
kled walnut chopped, or a gherkin or two, go admirably 
with mutton or pork chops. In short, this is just where 

70 



Sauces. 71 

imagination and brains will tell in cooking, and little 
essays of invention may be tried with profit. But be- 
ware of trying too much ; make yourself perfect in one 
thing before venturing on another. 

Espag:n'OLE, or brown sauce, is simply a rich stock well 
flavored with vegetables and herbs, and thickened with 
a piece of roux or with brown flour. 

White Sauce is one of those things we rarely find per- 
fectly made ; bad, it is the ne plus ultra of badness ; 
good, it is delicious. Those who have tried to have it 
good, and failed, I beg to try the following method of 
making it : Take an ounce and a half of butter and a 
scant tablespoonful of flour, mix both with a spoon into a 
paste ; when smooth add half a pint of warm miJk, a small 
teaspoonful of salt, and the sixth part of one of lohite pep- 
per ; set it on the fire till it boils, and is thick enough 
to mask the back of the spoon transparently ; then add a 
squeeze of lemon juice, and another ounce and a half of 
fresh butter ; stir this till quite blended. This sauce is 
the foundation for many others, and, for some purposes, 
the beaten yolk of an Qgg is introduced when just off 
the boil. Capers may be added to it, or chopped mush- 
rooms, or chopped celer}^ or oysters, according to the 
use for which it is intended. The object of adding the 
second butter is because boiling takes away the flavor of 
butter ; by stirring half of it in, without boiling, you re- 
tain it. 



CHAPTEE XL 

WAEMIi^G OYEE. 

Hash is a peculiarly American institution. In no 
other country is every remnant of cold meat turned into 
that one unvarying dish. AVhat do I say ? remnants of 
cold meat ! rather /om^s of cold meat, a roast of beef 
of which the tenderloin had sufficed for the first day's 
dinner, the leg of mutton from which a few slices only 
have been taken, the fillet of veal, available for so many 
delicate dishes, all are ruthlessly turned into the all- 
pervading hash. The curious thing is that people are 
not fond of it. Men exclaim against it, and its name 
stinks in the nostrils of those unhappy ones whose home 
is the boarding-house. 

Yet hash in 'itself is not a bad dish ; when I say it is 
a peculiarly American institution, I mean, that when 
English people speak of hash, they mean something 
quite different — meat warmed in slices. Our hash, in 
its best form — that is, made with nice gravy, garnished 
witli sippets of toast and pickles, surrounded with 
mashed potatoes or rice — is dignified abroad by the name 
of mince, and makes its appearance as an elegant little 
entree. Nor would it be anathematized in the way it 
is witb us, if it were only occasionally introduced. It 
is the familiarity that has led to contempt. "But 
what shall I do?" asks the young wife distressfully; 

72 



Warming Over. 73 

^' John likes joints, and lie and I and Bridget can't pos- 
sibly eat a roast at a meal." 

Very true ; and it is to just such perplexed young 
housekeepers that I hope this chapter will be especially 
useful— that is to say, small families with moderate 
means and a taste for good things. In this, as iii many 
other ways, large families are easier to cater for ; they 
can consume the better part of a roast at a meal, and 
the remains it is no great harm to turn into hash, al- 
though even they might, with little trouble and expense, 
have agreeable variety introduced into their bill of fare. 

In England and America there is great prejudice 
against warmed-over food, but on the continent one eats 
it half the time in some of the most delicious-made 
dishes without suspecting it. Herein lies the secret. 
With us and our transatlantic cousins the warming over 
is so artlessly done, that the hard fact too often stares 
at us from out the watery expanse in which it reposes. 

One great reason of the failure to make warmed-over 
meat satisfactory is the lack of gravy. On the goodness 
of this (as well as its presence) depends the success of 
your rechauffe. 

The glaze, for which I have given the recipe, renders 
you at all times independent in this respect, but at the 
same time it should not alone be depended on. Every 
drop of what remains in the dish from the roast should 
be saved, and great care be taken of all scraps, bones, 
and gristle, which should be carefully boiled down to 
save the necessity of flying to the glaze for every pur- 
pose. I will here give several recipes, which I think 
may be new to many readers. 

Salmi of Cold Meat is exceedingly good. Melt butter 
in a saucepan, if for quite a small dish two ounces will 
4 



74 Culture and Cooking, 

be sufficient ; when melted, stir in a little flour to 
thicken ; let it brown, but not burn, or, if you are pre- 
paring the dish in haste, put in some brown flour ; then 
add a glass of white or red wine and a cup of broth, or a 
cup of water and a slice of glaze, a sprig or two of 
thyme, parsley, a small onion, chopped, and one bay 
leaf, pepper, and salt. Simmer all thoroughly (all 
savory dishes to which wine is added should simmer 
long enough for the distinct "winey" flavor to disap- 
pear, only the strength and richness remaining). Strain 
this when simmered half an hour and lay in the cold 
meat. Squeeze in a little lemon juice and draw the 
stew-pan to the back of the stove, but where it will cook 
no longer, or the meat will harden. Serve on toast, and 
poui the sauce over. A glass of brandy added to this 
dish when the meat goes in is a great addition, if an 
extra fine salmi is desired. By not allowing the flour 
and butter to brown and using white wine, this is a very 
fine sauce in which to warm cold chicken, veal, or any 
white meat. 

BcEUF A LA Jardii^ieee. — Piit in a fireproof dish if 
you have it, or a thick saucepan, a pint of beef broth, a 
small bunch each of parsley, chervil, tarragon — very lit- 
tle of this — shallot or onion, capers, pickled gherkins, 
of each or any a teaspoonful chopped fine ; roll a large 
tablespoonful of butter with a dessert-spoonful of brown 
flour, stir it in ; then take slices of underdone beef, with 
a blunt knife hack each slice all over in fine dice, but 
not to separate or cut up the slices ; then pepper and 
salt each one and lay it in with the herbs, sprinkle a 
layer of herbs over the beef and cover closely ; then stand 
the dish in the oven to slowly cook for an hour, or, if 
you use a stew-pan, set in a pan of boiling water on the 



Warming Over. 75 

stove for an hour where the water will just boil. Serve 
on a dish surrounded with young carrots and turnips if 
in season, or old ones cut. 

Beef au Geatix. — Cut a little fat bacon or pork very 
thin, sprinkle on it chopped parsley, onion, and mush- 
rooms (mushroom powder will do) and bread-crumbs ; 
then put in layers of beef, cut thick, and Avell and closely 
hacked, then another layer of bacon or pork cut thin as 
a wafer, and of seasoning, crumbs last ; pour over enough 
broth or gravy to moisten well, in which a little brandy 
or wine may be added if an especially good dish is 
desired ; bake slowly an hour. 

PsEUDO Beefsteak. — Cut cold boiled or roast beef in 
thick slices, broil slowly, lay in a hot dish in which you 
have a large spoonful of Montpellier butter melted, 
sprinkle a little mushroom powder if you desire, and 
garnish with fried potato. 

Cutlets a la Jakdikieee. — Trim some thick cutlets 
from a cold leg of mutton, or chops from the loin, dip 
them in frying batter, a la Cartme, fry crisp and quickly, 
and serve wreathed round green peas, or a ragout made as 
follows : Take young carrots, turnips, green peas, white 
beans ; stew gently in a little water to which the bones 
of the meat and trimmings have been added (and which 
must be carefully removed not to disfigure the vegeta- 
bles). Encircle this ragout with the fried cutlets, and 
crown with a cauliflower. 

Ceomesquis of lamb is a Polish recipe. Cut some 
underdone lamb — mutton will of course do— quite small ; 
also some maishrooms, cut small, or the powder. Put in 
a saucepan apiece of glaze the size of a pigeon's Qgg, with 
a little water or broth, warm it and thicken with yolks 
of two eggs, just as you would make boiled custard, that

is, without letting it come to the boil, or it will curdle; 
then add the mushrooms and meat, let all get cold, and 
divide it into small pieces, roll in bread-crumbs sifted, 
then in ^gg, then in crumbs again, and fry in yery hot 
fat; or you may, after rolling in bread-crumbs, lay each 
piece in a spoon and dip it into frying batter ; let the 
extra batter run off, and drop the cromesquis into the 
hot fat. These will be good made of beef and rolled up 
in a bard of fat pork cut thin, and fried; serve with sauce 
piquant made thus : Take some chopped parsley, onion, 
and pickled cucumbers, simmer till tender, and thicken 
with an equal quantity of butter and flour. Of course 
your own brightness will tell you that, if you are in 
haste, a spoonful of Montpellier butter, the same of flour, 
melted in a little water, to which you add a teaspoonful 
of vinegar, will make an excellent sauce piquant, and 
this same is excellent for anything fried, as breaded 
chops, croquettes, etc. I may here say, that where two 
or three herbs are mentioned as necessary, for instance, 
parsley, tarragon, and chervil, if you have no tarragon 
you must leave it out, or chervil the same. It is only a 
matter of flavoring, at the same time flavor is a great 
deal, and these French herbs give that indescribable 
cachet to a dish which is one of the secrets of French 
cooking. Therefore if you are a wise matron you will 
have a supply on hand, even if only bought dry from the 
druggist. 

MiROTOK OP Beef.— Peel and cut into thin slices two 
large onions, put them in a stew-pan with two ounces of 
butter, place it over a slow fire ; stir the onions round till 
they are rather brown, but not in the least burnt ; add a 
teaspoonful of brown flour, mix smoothly, then moisten 
with half a pint of broth, or w^ater with a little piece of 



Wanning Over. • 77 

glaze, three salt-spoonfuls of salt unless your broth was 
salted, then half the quantity or less, two of sugar, and 
one of pepper. Put in the cold beef, cut in thin slices 
as lean as possible, let it remain five minutes at the back 
of the stoye ; then serve on a very hot dish garnished 
with fried potatoes, or sippets of toast. To vary the 
flavor, sometimes put a spoonful of tarragon or plain 
vinegar, or a teaspoonful of mushroom powder, or a 
pinch of curry, unless objected to, or a few sweet herbs. 
In fact, as you may see, variety is as easy to produce as 
it is rare to meet with in average cooking, and depends 
more on intelligence and thoughtfulness than on any- 
thing else. 

The simplest of all ways of warming a joint that is 
not far cut, is to wrap it in thickly buttered paper, and 
put it in the oven again, contriving, if possible, to cover 
it closely, let it remain long enough to get hot through, 
not to cook. By keeping it closely covered it will get 
hot through in less time, and the steam will prevent it 
getting hard and dry ; make some gravy hot and serve 
with the meat. If your gravy is good and plentiful, 
your meat w^lll be as nice as the first day; without gravy 
it w^ould be an unsatisfactory dish. If you cannot 
manage to cover the joint in tlie oven, you may put it in 
a pot over the fire without water, but with a dessert 
spoonful of vinegar to create steam ; let it get hot 
through, and serve as before. 

For the third day the meat may be warmed up in 
any of the ways I am going to mention, repeating once 
more, that you must have gravy of some kind, or else 
carefully make some, with cracked bones, gristle, etc., 
stewed long, and nicely flavored with any kind of 
sauce. 



yS Culture and Cooking, 

Eagout. — A very nice ragout may be made from cold 
meat thus : Slice the meat, put it in a stew-pan in which 
an onion, or several if you like them, has been sliced; 
squeeze half a lemon into it, or a dessert-spoonful of vine- 
gar, cover closely without water, and when it begins to 
cook, set the stew-pan at the back of the stove for three 
quarters of an hour, shaking it occasionally. The onions 
should now be brown; take out the meat, dredge in a little 
flour, stir it round, and add a cup of gravy, pepper, salt, 
and a small quantity of any sauce or flavoring you prefer; 
stew gently a minute or two, then put the meat back to 
get hot, and serve; garnish with sippets of toast, or 
pickles. 

A NICE LITTLE BEEAKFAST DISH is made thus : Cut 
two long slices of cold meat and three of bread, buttered 
thickly, about the same shape and size ; season the meat 
with pepper, salt, and a little finely chopped parsley; or, 
if it is veal, a little chopped ham ; then lay one slice of 
bread between two of meat, and have the other two slices 
outside ; fasten together with short wooden skewers. If 
you have a quick oven, put it in ; and take care to baste 
with butter thoroughly, that the bread may be all over 
crisp and brown. If you can't depend on your oven, fry 
it in very hot fat as you would crullers; garnish with 
sprigs of parsley, and serve very hot. 

To Wakm a Good-sized Piece of Beef. — Trim 
it as much like a thick fillet as you can ; cut it 
horizontally half way through, then scoop out as much 
as you can of the meat from the inside of each piece. 
Chop the meat fine that you have thus scooped out, 
season with a little finely chopped parsley and thyme, a 
shred of onion, if you like it; or if you have celery boil 
a little of the coarser part till tender, chop it and add 



Warming Over. yg 

as much bread finely crumbled as you have meat, and a 
good piece of butter ; add pepper and salt, and make all 
into a paste with an Qgg, mixed with an equal quantity 
of gravy or milk ; fill up the hollow in the meat and tie, 
or still better, sew it together. You may either put this 
in a pot with a slice of pork or bacon, and a cup of 
gravy; or you may brush it over with beaten egg, cover 
it with crumbs, and pour over these a cup of butter, 
melted, so that it moistens every part; and bake it, taking 
care to baste well while baking ; serve with nice gravy. 

Beef Olives are no novelty to the ear, but it is a 
novel thing to find them satisfactory to the palate. 

Take some stale bread-crumbs, an equal quantity of 
beef finely chopped, some parsley, and thyme ; a little 
scraped ham if you have it, a few chives, or a slice of 
onion, all chopped small as possible ; put some butter in 
a pan, and let this force-meat just simmer, not fry, in it 
for ten minutes. AVhile this is cooking, cut some un- 
derdone oblong slices of beef about half an inch thick, 
hack it with a sharp knife on hotli sides ; then mix the 
cooked force-meat with the yolk of an Qgg and a table- 
spoonful of gravy ; put a spoonful of this paste in the 
center of each slice of meat and tie it up carefully in the 
shape of an Qgg. Then if you have some nice gravy, 
thicken it with a piece of butter rolled in flour, roll each 
olive slightly in flour and lay it in the gravy and let it 
very gently simmer for half an hour. A few chopped 
oysters added to the gravy will be a great addition. Or 
you may lay each olive on a thin slice of fat pork, roll it 
up, tie it, dip it in flour, and bake in a quick oven until 
beautifully brown. 

To Warm over Cold MuTTOi^-. — An excellent and 
simple way is to cut it, if loin, into chops, or leg, into 



8o Culture and Cooking. 

thick collops, and dip each into egg well beaten with a 
tablespoonful of milk, then mfine bread-crumbs and fry 
in plenty of very hot fat. 

If your crumbs are not very fine and even, the larger 
crumbs will fall off, and the appearance be spoilt. 
These chops will be almost as nice, if quickly fried, as 
fresh cooked ones. They will also be excellent if, instead 
of being breaded, they are dipped into thick batter (see 
recipe) and fried brown in the same way. This method 
answers for any kind of meat, chicken thus warmed over 
being especially good. The batter, or egg and bread- 
crumbs form a sort of crust which keeps it tender and 
juicy. Any attempt to fry cold meat without either re- 
sults in a hard, stringy, uneatable dish. 

AVhite Meat of any kiis^d is excellent warmed over 
in a little milk, in which you have cut a large 
onion, and, if you like it, a slice of salt pork or 
ham, and a little sliced cucumber, if it is summer; 
thicken with the yolks of one or two eggs, added 
after the whole has simmered twenty minutes ; take 
care the egg thickens in the gravy, but does not hoil, 
or it will curdle. If it is in winter, chop a teaspoonful of 
pickled cucumber or capers and add just on going to 
table. In summer when you have the sliced cucumber, 
squeeze half a lemon into the gravy, the last thing, to 
give the requisite dash of acid. You may vary the above 
by adding sometimes a few chopped oysters ; at others, 
mushrooms, or celery. The last must be put in with 
the onion and before the meat. 

Deviled Meat. — Our better halves are usually fond 
of this, especially for breakfast or lunch. 

For this dish take a pair of turkey or chicken drumsticks 
or some nice thick wedges of underdone beef oii mutton, 



Warming Over, 8i 

score them deeply with a kiiife and rub them oyer with 
a sauce made thus: A teaspoonful of yinegar, the same 
of Haryey or Worcestershire sauce, the same of mustard, 
a little cayenne, and a tablespoonful of salad oil, or but- 
ter melted ; mix all till like cream, and take care your 
meat is thoroughly moistened all oyer with the mixture, 
then rub your gridiron with butter. See that the fire is 
clear, and while the gridiron is getting hot, chop a tea- 
spoonful of parsley yery fine, mix it up with a piece of 
butter the size of a walnut, and lay this in a dish which 
you will put to get hot. Then i)ut the meat to be grilled 
on the fire and turn often, so that it will not burn; when 
hot through and brown, lay it in the hot dish, lay an- 
other hot dish oyer it, and serye as quickly as possible 
with hot plates. 

Or the grill may be seryed with what Soyer calls his 
Mepliistoplielian sauce, which he especially designed for 
serying with deyiled meats. Chop six shallots or small 
onions, wash and press them in the corner of a clean 
cloth, put them in a stew-pan with half a Avineglass of 
chili yinegar (pepper sauce), a chopped cloye, a tiny bit 
of garlic, two bay leayes, an ounce of glaze; boil all to- 
gether ten minutes ; then add four tablespoonfuls of 
tomato sauce, a little sugar, and ten of broth tliickened 
with roux (or water will do if you haye no broth). 

It will be remarked that in many French recipes a 
little sugar is ordered. This is not meant to sweeten, or 
eyen be perceptible; but it enriches, softens, tones, as it 
were, the other ingredients as salt does. 

Soyee's Feitadella (twenty recipes in one). — Put 

half a pound of bread-crumb to soak in a pint of cold 

water; take the same quantity of any kind of roast, or 

boiled meat, with a little fat, chop it fine, press the

82 Culture and Cooking, 

bread in a clean cloth to extract the water ; put in a 
stew-pan two ounces of butter, a tablespoonful of chopped 
onions ; fry two minutes aad stir, then add the bread, 
stir and fry till rather dry, then the meat ; season with a 
teaspoonf ul of salt, half of pepper, and a little grated nut- 
meg, and lemon peel; stir continually till yery hot, then 
add two eggs, one at a time; mix well and pour on a dish 
to get cold. Then take a piece, shape it like a small ^gg, 
flatten it a little, Qgg and bread-crumb it all over, tak- 
ing care to keep in good shape. Do all the same way, 
then put into a frying-pan a quarter of a pound of lard 
or dripping, Jet it get hot, and put in the pieces, and 
saute (or as we call it ^^/r?/") them a fine j^ellow brown. 
Serve very hot with a border of mashed potatoes, or any 
garniture you fancy. Sauce jiiquant, or not, as you 
please. 

The above can be m.ade with any kind of meat, poul- 
try, game, fish, or even vegetables; hard eggs, or potatoes, 
may be introduced in small quantities, and they may be 
fried instead of sauteed (frying in the French and strict 
sense, meaning as I need hardly say, entire immersion in 
very hot fat). To fry them j'ou require at least two 
pounds of fat in your pan. 

Oysters or lobsters prepared as above are excellent. 

Boileau says, ^* Tin diner rechauffe ne valut jamais 
rien." But I think a good French cook of the present 
day would make him alter his opinion. 

Indeed Savarin quotes a friend of his own, a notable 
gourmand, who considered spinach cooked on Monday 
only reached perfection the following Saturday, having 
each day of the week been warmed up with butter, and 
each day gaining succulence and a more marrowy consist- 
ency. 



Wanning Over. 83 

The only trouble I find in relation to this part of my 
present task is the difficulty of knowing when to leave 
off. There are so many ways of warming meats to ad- 
vantage—and in every one way there is the suggestion 
for another — that I suffer from an emlarras de ricliesse^ 
and have had difficulty in selecting. Dozens come to my 
mind, blanquettes, patties, curries, as I write; but as 
this is not, I have said, to be a recipe book, I forbear. Of 
one thing I am quite sure : when women once know how to 
make nice dishes of cold meat they will live well where 
they now live badly, and for less money; and ^4iash" will 
be relegated to its proper place as an occasional and ac- 
ceptable dish. 



CHAPTER XIL 

OK FKIANDISES. 

" Le role du gourmand finit avec I'entremets, et celui du friand 
commence au dessert. — Grimod de la Reyniere. 

Amekican ladies, as a rule, excel in cake making and 
preserving, and I feel that on that head I have very little 
to teach ; indeed, were they as accomplished in all 
branches of cooking as in making dainty sweet dishes 
this book would be uncalled for. 

Yet, notwithstanding their undoubted taste and ability 
in making ^'friandises,^^ it seems to me a few recipes 
borrowed from what the French call la grande cuisine^ 
and possible of execution at home, will be welcome to 
those who wish to vary the eternal ice cream and char- 
lotte russe, with other sweets more elegant and likely to 
be equally popular. 

Iced Souffle a la Bykof. — One pint of sugar 
syrup of 32 degrees (get this at a druggist's if 
you do not understand sugar boiling), three gills of 
strained raspberry juice, one lemon, one gill of maras- 
chino, fifteen yolks of eggs, two ounces of chocolate 
drops, half a pint of very thick cream whipped. 

Method of making this and the next recipe is as follows: 
Mix the syrup and yolks of eggs, strain into a warm 
bowl, add the raspberry and lemon juice and maras- 
chino, whisk till it creams well, then take the bowl out 

84 



On Friandiscs. 85 

of the hot water and whisk ten minutes longer ; add the 
chocolate drops and whipped cream ; lightly fill a case 
or mold, and set in a freezer for two hours, then coyer 
the surface with lady-fingers (or sponge cake) dried in 
the oven a pale brown, and rolled. Serve at once. 

Another frozen souffle is as follows : 

One pint of syrup, 32 degrees, half a pint of noyeau, 
half a pint of cherry juice, two ounces of bruised 
macaroons, half a i^int of thick cream whipped, made in 
the same way as the last. I may here say that the fruit 
juices can be procured now at all good druggists, so that 
these souffles are very attainable in winter, and as noy- 
eau and maraschino do not form j^art of the stores in a 
family of small means, I will give in this chapter recipes 
for the making of very fair imitations of the genuine 
liqueurs. 

Biscuit Glace a la Charles Dickers. — One pint 
of syrup (32°), fifteen yolks of eggs, three gills of peach 
pulp, colored pink with cochineal, one gill of noyeau, 
half a pint of thick cream, and a little chocolate water- 
ice, made with half a pint of syrup and four ounces of 
the best chocolate smoothly mixed and frozen ready. 

Mix syrup, yolks, peach pulps, noyeau, and a few 
drops of vanilla, whip high ; mix with the whipped 
cream, and set in ice for one hour and a half in brick- 
shaped molds, then turn out (if very firm), and cut in 
slices an inch thick, and coat them all over, or on top 
and sides, with the chocolate ice, smoothing with a knife 
dipped in cold water ; serve in paper cases. 

Biscuit Glace a la Thackeray. — One pint of syrup 
(32°), one pint of strawberry pulp, fifteen yolks of eggs, 
one ounce of vanilla sugar (flavor a little sugar with va- 
nilla), half a pint of thick cream. 



86 Culture and Cooking, 

Mix syrnjD, yolks, strawberry, and Tanilla sugar, whip- 
ping as before, then add the wdiijoped cream lightly ; fill 
paper cases, either round or square ; surround each with 
a band of stiif paper, to reach half an inch above the 
edge of the case, the bands to be i^inncd together to se- 
cure them ; j^l^^e them in a freezer. "When about to send 
to table, remove the bands of paper, and cover with 
macaroons bruised fine and browned in the oven. The 
bands of paper are meant to give the biscuit the appear- 
ance of having risen while supposed to bake. 

These delicious ices were invented by Francatelli, the 
Queen of England's chief cook, to do homage to the 
different great men whose names they bear, on the occa- 
sion of preparing dinners given in their honor. They 
read as if somewhat intricate, but any lady who has ever 
had ice cream made at home, and had the patience to 
make charlotte russe, need not shrink appalled before 
these novelties, or fear for a successful result. 

Baba is a cake many call for at a confectioner's, yet 
few, if any one, attempts to make it at home. That 
the recipes generally offered do not lead to success may be 
one reason, and I offer the following, quite sure, if ac- 
curately followed, such a baba will result as never was 
eaten outside of Paris. 

Baba. — One pound of flour ; take one quarter of it, 
and make a sponge with half an ounce of compressed 
yeast and a little warm water, set it to rise, make a hole 
in the rest of the flour, add to it ten ounces of butter, 
three eggs, and a dessert-spoonful of sugar, a little salt, 
unless your butter salts it enough, which is generally 
the case. Beat all together well, then add five more eggs, 
one at a time, that is to say, add one ^.^^ and beat well, 
then another and beat again, and so on until the five are 



On Friandises. 8/ 

used. "VThen the paste leaves the bowl it is beaten 
enough, but not before ; then add the sponge to it, and 
a large half ounce of citron cliopped, the same of cur- 
rants, and an ounce and a half of sultana raisins, seed- 
less. Let it rise to twice its size, then bake it in an oven 
of dark yellow paper heat ; the small round babas are an 
innovation of the pastry-cook to enable him to sell them 
uncut. But the baba proper should be baked in a large, 
deep, upright tin, such as a large charlotte russe mold, 
when they keep for several days fresh, and if they get 
stale, make delicious fritters, soaked in sherry and 
dipped in frying batter. 

In some cases, however, it may be preferred to make 
them as usually seen at French pastry cooks ; for this 
purpose you require a dozen small-sized round char- 
lotte russe molds, which fill half full only, as they 
rise very much; bake these in a hotter oven, light brown 
paper heat; try with a twig as you would any other cake, 
if it comes out dry it is done ; then prepare a syrup as 
follows : Boil half pound of sugar in a pint of water, add 
to this the third of a pint of rum, and some apricot 
pulp — peach will of course do — and boil all together a 
few minutes ; pour this half an inch deep in a dish, and 
stand the cake or cakes in it ; it should drink up all the 
syrup, you may also sprinkle some over it. If any syrup 
remains, use it to warm over your cake when stale, 
instead of the sherry. 

Baba was introduced iuto France by Stanislas Lec- 
zinski, king of Poland, and the father-in-law of Louis 
XIV. ; and his Polish royal descendants still use with 
it, says Careme, a syrup made o£ Malaga wine and 
one sixth part of eau de tanaisie. 

But, although our forefathers seemed to have relished 



88 Culture mid Cooking, 

tansy very much, to judge from old recipe books, I 
doubt if such flavoriug would be appreciated in our 
time. 

Savariks — commonly called wine cake by New York 
pastry cooks — are made as follows : 

One pound of flour, of which take one quarter to make 
a sponge, using half an ounce of German compressed yeast, 
and a little warm milk ; when it has risen to twice its 
bulk, add one gill of hot milk, two eggs, and the rest of 
the flour ; mix well ; then add one more ^gg and beat, 
another, still beating; then add three quarters of a 
pound of fresh butter, a quarter of an ounce of salt, half 
an ounce of sugar, and half a gill of hot milk, beat well; 
then add eggs, one at a time, beating continually, until 
you have used five more. Out in small dice three ounces 
of candied orange peel; butter a tin, which should be deep 
and straight-sided — a tin pudding boiler is not a bad 
thing — and sprinkle with chopped almonds. Fill the 
mold half full, and when risen to twice its bulk, bake in 
a moderate oven, dark yellow paper heat. When served, 
this cake should stand in a dish of syrup, flavored with 
rum, as for baJ^a, or with sherry wine. 

BoucHEES DES Dames, a very ornamental and delicious 
little French cake, is sufficiently novel to deserve a place 
here, I think. Make any nice drop cake batter (either 
sponge, or sponge with a little butter in it I prefer) ; drop 
one on buttered paper and bake ; if it runs, beat in a 
little more flour and sugar, but not much, or your cakes 
will be brittle ; they should be the size, when done, of a 
fifty-cent piece, and I find half a teaspoonful of batter 
dropped generally makes them about right. Have a 
tin cutter or tin box lid, if 5^ou have no cutter so small, 
about the size, and with it trim each cake when baked ; 



Oil Friandiscs, 89 

then take half the number and sjoread some with a yery 
thin layer of red currant jelly, others with peach or 
raspberry ; then on each so spread put a cake that is 
unspread, thus making a tiny sandwich or jelly cake. 
If you have different sorts of jelly, put each separate, as 
you must adapt the Hayor of your icing to the jelly. 
Por red currant, ice with chocolate icing. Recipes for 
icing are so general that I refer you to your cookery 
book. Those with peach may have white icing, flavored 
with almond, or with rum, beating in a little more 
sugar if the flavoring dilutes your icing too much. Al- 
mond flavoring goes well with rasj)berry. Cakes with 
raspberry jelly or jam should be iced pink, coloring the 
icing with prepared cochineal or cranberry juice. Thus 
you have your cakes brown, pink, and white, which look 
very pretty mixed. 

The process of icing is difficult to do after they are put 
together, but they are much handsomer this way, and 
keep longer. You require, to accomplish it, a good 
quantity of each kind of icing, and a number of little 
wooden skewers ; stick one into each cake and dip it 
in the icing, let it run off, then stand the other end of 
the skewer in a box of sand or granulated sugar. The 
easiest way is to ice each half cake before putting in 
the jelly; when the icing is hard spread with jelly, and 
put together. 

CuEA(;OA may be successfully imitated by pouring over 
eight ounces of the thirily pared rind of very ripe 
oranges a pint of boiling water, cover, and let it cool ; 
then add two quarts of brandy, or strong French spirit, 
cover closely, and let it stand fourteen days, shaking it 
every day. Make a clarified syrup of two pounds of 
sugar into one pint of water, well boiled ; strain the 



90 Culture and Cooking. 

brandy into it, leaving it coyered close another day. 
Eub up in a mortar one draclim of potash, with a 
teaspoonful of the liqueurs ; when well blended, put this 
into the liqueur, and in the same way pound and add 
a drachm of alum, shake well, and in an hour or two 
filter through thin muslin. Eeady for use in a week or 
two. 

MAEASCHii^o . — Bruise slightly a dozen cherry kernels, 
put them in a deep jar with the outer rind of three or- 
anges and two lemons, cover with two quarts of gin, then 
add syrup and leave it a fortnight, as for curagoa. Stir 
syrup and spirit together, leave it another day, run it 
through a jelly bag, and bottle. Ready to use in ten 
days. 

NoTEAU. — Blanch and pound two pounds of bitter al- 
monds, or four of peach kernels ; put to them a gallon of 
spirit or brandy, two pounds of white sugar candy — or 
sugar will do— a grated nutmeg, and a pod of vanilla ; 
leave it three weeks covered close, then filter and bottle ; 
but do not use it for three months. To be used with 
caution. 



CHAPTER XIII. 

FEEI^CH CAIs-DT AT HO^E. 

This chapter I shall have to make one of recipes 
chiefly, for it treats of a branch of cooking not usually 
found in cookery books, or at least there is seldom any- 
thing on the art of confectionery beyond molasses or 
cream taify and nougat. These, therefore, I shall not 
touch upon, but rather show you how to make the ex- 
pensive French candies. 

The great art of making these exquisite candies is in 
boiling the sugar, and it is an art easily acquired with 
patience. 

Put into a marbleized saucepan (by long experience in. 
sugar-boiling I find them less likely to burn even than 
brass, and I keep one for the purpose) one pound of 
sugar and half a pint of water ; when it has boiled ten 
minutes begin to try it ; have a bowl of water with a 
piece of ice near you, and drop it from the end of a 
spoon. When it falls to the bottom, and you can take it 
up and make it into a softish ball (not at all sticky) be- 
tween your thumb and finger, it is at the right point ; 
remove it from the fire to a cold place ; when cool, if 
perfectly right, a thin jelly-like film will be over the 
surface, not a sugary one j if it is sugary, and you want 
your candy very creamy, you must add a few spoonfuls 
of water, return to the fire and boil again, going through 

91 



92 Culture and Cooking. 

the same process of trying it. You must be careful that 
there is not the least inclination to be brittle in the ball 
of candy you take from the water ; if so, it is boiled a 
degree too high ; put a little water to bring it back again, 
and try once more. A speck of cream of tartar is use- 
ful in checking a tendency in the syrup to go to sugar. 
When you have your sugar boiled just right set it to 
cool, and when you can bear your finger in it, begin to 
beat it with a spoon ; in ten minutes it will be a white 
paste resembling lard, which you will find you can work 
like bread dough. This, then, is j'our foundation, 
called by French confectioners fondant ; with yonr fon- 
dant you can work marvels. But to begin with the 
simplest French candies. 

Take a piece of fondant, flavor part of it with vanilla, 
jiart of it with lemon, color yellow (see coloring can- 
dies), and another part with raspberry, color pink ; make 
these into balls, grooved cones, or anything that strikes 
your fancy, let them stand till they harden, they are 
then ready for use. 

Take another part of yovA- fondant, have some English 
walnuts chopped, flavor with vanilla and color pink ; 
work the walnuts into the j)aste as you would fruit into 
a loaf cake ; when mixed, make a paper case an inch 
wide and deep, and three or four inches long; oil it; 
press thei^aste into it, andv,-lien firm turn it out and cut 
into cubes. Or, instead of walnuts, use chopped al- 
monds, flavor with vanilla, and leave \\xq fondant white. 
This makes Yaxilla Almoxd Cream. 

TuTTi Frutti Caitdy. — Chop some almonds, citron, 
a few currants, and seedless raisins ; work into some 
fondant, flavor with rum and lemon, thus making Eo- 
man punch, or Avith vanilla or raspberry ; j^ress into the 



French Candy at Home, 93 

paper forms as you did the walnut cream. You see how 
you can ring the changes on these bars, varying the 
flayoring, inventing new combinations, etc. 

Foj^dantPakache.— Take jom fondant, divide it in 
three equal parts, color one pink and flavor as you choose, 
leave the other white and flavor also as you please ; 
but it must agree with the pink, and both must agree 
with the next, which is chocolate. Melt a little un- 
sweetened chocolate by setting it in a saucer over the 
boiling kettle, then take enough of it to make your third 
piece of fondant a fine brown ; now divide the white 
into two parts ; make each an inch and a half wide, and 
as long as it will ; do the same with the chocolate fon- 
dant ; then take the pink, make it the same width and 
length, but of course, not being divided, it will be twice 
as thick ; now butter slightly the back of a plate, or, 
better still, get a few sheets of waxed paper from the 
confectioner's ; lay one strip of the chocolate on it, then 
a strip of white on that, then the pink, the other white, 
and lastly the chocolate again ; then lightly press them 
to make them adhere, but not to squeeze them out of 
shape. You have now an oblong brick of parti-colored 
candy ; leave it for a few hours to harden, then trim it 
neatly with a knife and cut it crosswise into slices half 
an inch think, lay on waxed paper to dry, turning once 
in a while, and pack away in boxes. 

If jowr fondant gets very hard while you work, stand 
it over hot water a few minutes. 

Creamed candies are very fashionable just now, and, 
J owr fondant once ready, are very easy to make. 

Cream Walnuts. — Make ready some almonds, some 
walnuts in halves, some hazelnuts, or anything of the 
sort you fancy ; let them be very dry. Take fondant made 



94 Culture and Cooking. 

from a pound of sugar, set it in a bowl in a saucepan of 
boiling water, stirring it till it is like cream. Then having 
flavored it with vanilla or lemon, drop in your nuts one 
by one, taking them out with the other hand on the end 
of a fork, resting it on the edge of your bowl to drain for 
a second, then drop the nut on to a waxed or buttered 
paper neatly. If the nut shows through the cream it is 
too hot ; take it out of the boiling water and beat till it 
is just thick enough to mask the nut entirely, then re- 
turn it to the boiling water, as it cools very rapidly and 
becomes unmanageable, when it has to be warmed over 
again. 

Veet fixe chocolate ckeams are made as follows : 
Boil half a pound of sugar with three tablespoonfuls of 
thick cream till it makes a soft ball in water, then let it 
cool. When cool beat it till it is very white, flavor with a 
few drops of vanilla and make it into balls the size of a large 
pea; then take some unsweetened chocolate warmed, mix 
it with a piece oi fondant melted — there should be more 
chocolate than sugar — and when quite smooth and thick 
enough to mask the cream, drop them in from the end 
of a fork, take them out, and drop on to wax paper. 

Another very fine candy to be made without heat, 
and therefore convenient for hot weather, is made as 
follows : 

PuKCH Drops.— Sift some powdered sugar. Have 
ready some fine white gum-arabic, put a tablespoonful 
with the sugar (say half a pound of sugar), and make it 
into a firm paste ; if too wet, add more sugar, flavor with 
lemon and a tiny speck of tartaric acid or a very little lem- 
on juice. Make the paste into small balls, then take more 
sugar and make it into icing with a spoonful of Santa 
Cruz rum and half the white of an ^gg. Try if it 



French Candy at Home. 95 

hardens, if not, beat in more sugar and color it a bright 
pink, then dip each ball in the pink icing and harden 
on wax paper. These are very novel, beautiful to look 
at, and the flavors may vary to taste. 

To MAKE COCHIN^EAL COLORING WHICH IS QUITE 

Harmless. — Take one ounce of powdered cochineal, 
one ounce of cream of tartar, two drachms of alum, 
half a pint of water ; boil the cochineal, water, and 
cream of tartar till reduced to one half, then add the 
alum, and put up in small bottles for use. Yellow is 
obtained by the infusion of Spanish saffron in a little 
water, or a still better one from the grated rind of a 
ripe orange put into muslin, and a little of the juice 
squeezed through it. 

Be careful in boiling the sugar tor fondant, not to stir 
it after it is dissolved ; stirring causes it to become rough 
instead of creamy. 



CHAPTER XIV. 

A CHAPTER FOR PEOPLE OF YERY SMALL MEAKS. 

I AM sorry to say in these days this chapter may ap- 
peal to many, who are yet not to be called '* poor peo- 
ple," who may have been well-to-do and only suffering 
from the pressure of the times, and for whose cultivated 
appetites the coarse, substantial food of the laboring man 
(eyen if they could buy it) would not be eatable, who 
must have what they do have good, or starye. But, as 
some of the things for which I giye recipes will seem 
over-economical for people who can afford to buy meat 
at least once a day, I advise those wdio have even fifty 
dollars a month income to skip it ; reminding them, if 
they do not, ^^that necessity knows no law." 

A bone of soup meat can be got at a good butcher's 
for tenor fifteen cents, and is about the best invest- 
ment, for that sum I know of, as two nourishing and 
savory meals, at least, for four or five persons can be 
got from it. 

Carefully make a nice soup, with plenty of vegetables, 
rice, or any other thickening you like. Your bone will 
weigh from four to six pounds, perhaps ; put it on with 
water according to size, and let it boil down slowly until 
nice and strong. If you have had any scraps of meat or 
bones, put them also to your soup. 

When you serve it, keep back a cup of soup and a few 

96 



Chapter for People of Very Small Means. 97 

of tlie vegetables, and save tlie meat, from which you 
can make a yery appetizing hash in the following way : 
Take the meat from the bone, chop it with some cold 
potatoes and the vegetables you saved from the soup. 
Cold stewed onions, boiled carrots or turnips, all help to 
make the dish savory. Chop an onion very fine, unless 
you have cold ones, a little parsley and thyme, if liked, 
and sometimes, for variety's sake, if you have it, a pinch 
of curry powder, not enough to make it hot or yellow, 
yet to impart piquancy. If you have a tiny bit of fried 
bacon or cold ham or cold pork, chop it with the other 
ingredients, mix all well, moisten with the cold soup, 
and, when nicely seasoned, put the hash into an iron 
frying-pan, in which you have a little fat made hot ; 
pack it smoothly in, cover it with a pot-lid, and either 
set it in a hot oven, or leave it to brown on the stove. 
If there was more soup than enough to moisten the hash, 
put it on in a tiny saucepan, with a little brown flour 
made into a paste with butter, add a drop of tomato cat- 
sup, or a little stewed tomato, or anything you have for 
flavoring, and stir till it boils. Then turn the hash out 
whole on a dish, it should be brown and crisp, pour the 
gravy you have made round it, and serve. For a change 
make a pie of the hash, pouring the gravy in through 
a hole in the toj) when done. 

It is not generally known that a very nice plain paste 
can be made with a piece of bread dough, to wliich you 
have added an ^gg, and some lard, dripping, or butter. 
The dripping is particularly nice for the hash pie, and, 
as you need only a piece of dough as large as an orange, 
you will probably have enough from the soup, if you 
skimmed off all the fat before putting the vegetables in 
{^QQ pot-au-feu) ; work your dripping into the dough, 
5 



98 Culture and Cookmg. 

and let it rise well, then roll as ordinary pie-crust. Po- 
tato crust is also very good for plain pies of any sort, but 
as there are plenty of recipes for it, I will not give one 
here. 

One of the very best hashes I ever ate was prepared 
by a lady who, in better times, kept a very fine table. 
And she told me there were a good many cold beans 
in it, well mashed ; and often since, when taking " trav- 
elers' hash" in an hotel, I have thought of that savory 
dish with regret. 

Instead of making your chopjDcd meat into hash, vary 
it, by rolling thfe same mixture into egg-shaped pieces, 
or flat cakes, flouring them, and frying them nicely in 
very hot fat ; pieces of pork or bacon fried and laid 
round will help out the dish, and be an improvement 
to what is already very good. 

To return once more to the soup bone. If any one of 
your family is fond of marrow, seal uj) each end of the 
bone with a paste made of flour and water. When done, 
take oif the paste, and remove the marrow. Made very 
hot, and spread on toast, with pepper and salt, it will be 
a relish for some one's tea or breakfast. 

In this country there is a prejudice against sheep's 
liver ; w^hile in England, where beef liver is looked upon 
as too coarse to eat (and falls to the lot of the ^'cats- 
meat man," or cat butcher), sheep's is esteemed next to 
calf's, and it is, in fact, more delicate than beef liver. 
The nicest way to cook it is in very tMn slices (not the 
inch-thick pieces one often sees), each slice dipped in 
flour and fried in pork or bacon fat, and pork or bacon 
served with it. But the more economical way is to put 
it in a pan, dredge it with flour, pin some fat pork over 
it, and set it in a hot oven ; when very brown take it out ; 



Chapter for People of Very Small Means. 99 

make nice brown gravy by pouring water in the pan and 
letting it boil on the stove, stirring it well to dissolve the 
glaze ; 23our into the dish, and serve. The heart should 
be stufled with bread-crumbs, parsley, thyme, and a lit- 
tle onion, and baked separately. Or, for a change, you 
may chop the liver up with a few sweet herbs and a lit- 
tle pork (onion, or not, as you like), and some bread- 
crumbs. Put all together in a crock, dredge with flour, 
cover, and set in a slow oven for an hour and a half ; 
then serve, with toasted bread around the dish. 

It is very poor economy to buy inferior meat. One 
pound of fine beef has more nourishment than two of 
poor quality. But there is a great difference in prices of 
different parts of meat, and it is better management to 
choose the cheap part of fine beef than to buy the sir- 
loin of a poor ox even at the same price ; and, by good 
cooking many parts not usually chosen, and therefore 
sold cheaply, can be made very good. Yet you must 
remember, that a piece of meat at seven cents a pound, 
in which there is at least half fat and bone, such as 
brisket, etc., is less economical than solid meat at ten or 
twelve. 

Pot roasts are very good for parts of meat not tender 
enough for roasting, the ^^ cross-rib," as some butch- 
ers term it, being very good for this purpose ; it is all 
solid meat, and being very lean, requires a little fat pork, 
which may be laid at the bot!om of the pot; or better 
still, holes made in the meat and pieces of the fat drawn 
through, larding in a rough way, so that they cut to- 
gether. A pot roast is best put on in an iron pot, with- 
out water, allowed to get finely brown on one side, then 
turned, and when thoroughly brown on the other a little 
water may be added for gravy ; chop parsley or any 



100 Culture and Cooking, 

seasoning that is preferred. Give your roast at least 
three hours to cook. Ox cheek, as the head is called, is 
very good, and should be very cheap ; prepare it thus : 

Clean the cheek, soak it in water six hours, and cut 
the meat from the bones, which break up for soup; 
then take the meat, cut into neat pieces, put it in an 
earthen crock, a layer of beef, some thin pieces of pork 
or bacon, some onions, carrots, and turnips, cut tiling or 
chopped fine, and sprinkled over the meat ; also, some 
chopped parsley, a little thyme, and bay leaf, pepper 
and salt, and a clove to each layer ; then more beef and 
a little pork, vegetables, and seasoning, as before. "When 
all your meat is in pour over it, if you have it, a tum- 
bler of hard cider and one of water, or else two of water, 
in which put a half gill of vinegar. If you have no 
tight-fitting cover to your crock, put a paste of flour and 
water over it to keep the steam in. Place the crock in a 
slow oven five or six hours, and when it is taken out re- 
move the crust and skim. Any piece of beef cooked in 
this way is excellent. 

Ox heart is one of the cheapest of dishes, and really 
remarkably nice, and it is much used by economical peo- 
ple abroad. 

The heart should be soaked in vinegar and water three 
or four hours, then cut off the lobes and gristle, and 
stuff it with fat pork chopped, bread-crnmbs, parsley, 
thyme, pepper, and salt ; then tie it in a cloth and very 
slowly simmer it (large end up) for two hours ; take it 
up, remove the cloth, and flour it, and roast it a nice 
brown. Lay in the pan in which it is to be roasted some 
fat pork to baste it. Any of this left over is excellent 
hashed, or, warmed in slices with a rich brown gravy, can- 
rtot be told from game. Another way is to stuff it with 



Chapter for People of Very Small Means. lOi 

sage and onions. It must always be served very hot with 
hot phites and on a very hot dish. 

Fore quarter of mutton is another very economical part 
of meat, if you get your butcher to cut it so that it may 
not only be economical, but really afford a choice joint. 
Do not then let him hack the shoulder across, but, before 
he does a thing to it, get him to take the shoulder out in 
a round plate-shaped joint, with knuckle attached ; if 
he does this well, that is, cuts it close to the bone of the 
ribs, you will have a nice joint ; then do not have it 
chopped at all ; this should be roasted in the oven very 
nicely, and served with onion sauce or stewed onions. If 
onions are not liked, mashed turnips are the appro- 
priate vegetable. This joint, to be enjoyed, must be 
properly carved, and that is, across the middle from the 
edge to the bone, the same as a leg of mutton ; and like 
the leg, you must learn, as I cannot describe it in words, 
where the bone lies, then have that side nearest you and 
cut from the opposite side. 

You have, besides this joint, another roast from the 
ribs, or else cut it up into chops till you come to the 
part under the shoulder; from this the breast should be 
separated and both either made into a good Irish stew, 
or the breast prepared alone in a way I shall describe, 
the neck and thin ribs being stewed or boiled. 

The neck of mutton is very tender boiled and served 
with parsley or caper sauce ; the liquor it is boiled in 
served as broth, Avith vegetables and rice, or prepared as 
directed in a former chapter for the broth from leg of 
mutton. 

The mode I am about to give of preparing breast of 
mutton w^as told me by a Welsh lady of rank, at whose 
table I ate it (it appeared as a side dish), and who said. 



102 -v: Culture and Cooking. 

half laughingly, ^' Will you take some ' fluff ' ? We are 
very fond of it, but br^st of mutton is such a despised 
dish I never expect any one else to like it." I took it, 
on my principle of trying everything, and did find it 
very good. This lady told me that, having of course a 
good deal of mutton killed on her father's estate, and the 
breast being always despised by the servants, she had in- 
vented a way of using it to avoid waste. Her way was this: 

Set the breast of mutton on the fire whole, just cov- 
ered with water in which is a little salt. When it comes 
to the boil draw it back and let it simmer three hours ; 
then take it up and draw out the bones, and lay a force- 
meat of bread-crumbs, parsley, thyme, chopped suet, 
salt and pepper all over it ; double or roll it, skewer it, 
and coat it thickly with Qgg and bread-crumbs ; then 
bake in a moderate oven, basting it often with nice drip- 
ping or butter ; when nicely brown it is done, and eats 
like the tenderest lamb. It was, when I saw it, served on 
a bed of spinach. I like it better on a bed of stewed 
onions. 

I now give some dishes made without meat. 

Eagout of Cucumber akd Okio:n^s. — Fry equal 
quantities of large cucumbers and onions in slices until 
they are a nice brown. The cucumber will brown more 
easily if cut up and put to drain some time before using; 
then flour each slice. When both are brown, pour on 
them a cup of water, and let them stew for half an hour ; 
then take a good piece of butter in which you have 
worked a dessert-spoonful of flour (browned) ; add pep- 
per, salt, and a little tomato catsup or stewed tomato. 
This is a rich-eating dish if nicely made, and will help 
out cold meat or a scant quantity of it very well. A 
little cold meat may be added if you have it. 



Chapter for People of Very Small Means. 103 

Okio:n' Soup. — Fry six large onions cut into slices 
with a quarter of a pound of butter till they are of a 
bright brown, then well mix in a tablespoonful of flour, 
and pour on them rather more than a quart of water. 
Stew gently until the onions are quite tender, season 
with a spoonful of salt and a little sugar ; stir in quickly 
a liaison made with the yolks of two eggs mixed with 
a gill of milk or cream (do not let it boil afterwards), 
put some toast in a tureen, and serve very hot. 

Pea Soup. — Steep some yellow split peas all night, next 
morning set them on to boil with two quarts of water to a 
pint of peas ; in the water put a tiny bit of soda. In an- 
other pot put a large carrot, a turnip, an onion, and a 
large head of celery, all cut small and covered with water. 
When both peas and vegetables are tender, put them 
together, season with salt, pepper, and a little sugar, 
and let them gently stew till thick enough ; then strain 
through a colander, rubbing the vegetables well, and 
return to the pot while you fry some sippets of bread a 
crisp brown ; then stir into the soup two ounces of but- 
ter in which you have rolled a little flour. 

This soup is simply delicious, and the fact of it being 
maigre will not be remembered. 

Potato Soup is another of this good kind, for meat is 
scarcely required, so good is it without. 

Boil some potatoes, then rub them through a colandar 
into two quarts of hot milk (skimmed does quite well); 
have some fine-chopped parsley and onion, add both 
with salt and pepper, stew three quarters of an hour ; 
then stir in a large piece of butter, and beat two eggs 
with a little cold milk, stir in quickly, and serve with 
fried bread. There should be potatoes enough to mxake 
the soup as thick as cream. 



104 Culture and Cooking. 

Do not be prejudiced against a dish because there is 
no meat in it, and you think it cannot be nourishing. 
This chapter is not written for those with whom meat, 
or money, is plentiful ; and if it be true that man is 
nourished ** not by what he eats, but by what he assim- 
ilates," and, according to an American medical author- 
ity, **what is eaten with distaste is not assimilated" 
(Dr. Hall), it follows that an enjoyable dinner, even 
without meat, will be more nourishing than one forced 
down because it lacks savor ; that potato soup will be 
more nourishing than potatoes and butter, with a cup of 
milk to drink, because more enjoyable. Yet it costs no 
more, for the soup can be made without the eggs if they 
are scarce. 

Or say bread and butter and onions. They will not 
be very appetizing, especially if they had to be a fre- 
quent meal, yet onion soup is made from the same ma- 
terials, and in France is a very favorite dish, even with 
those well able to put meat in it if they wished. 



CHAPTER XV. 

A FEW THIis'GS IT IS WELL TO KEMEMBER. 

Every housekeeper has pet ^* wrinkles" of her own 
which she thinks are especially yaluable ; some are 
known to all the world, others are new to many. So 
it may be with mine ; but, on the chance that some few 
things are as new to my friends as they were to me, I 
jot them down without any pretense of order or regu- 
larity. 

Lemons will keep fresher and better in water than any 
other way. Put them in a crock, cover them with water. 
They will in winter keep two or three months, and the 
peel be as fresh as the day they were put in. Take care, 
of course, that they do not get frosted. In summer 
change the water twice a week ; they will keep a long 
time. 

In grating nutmegs begin at the flower end ; if you 
commence at the other, there will be a hole all the way 
through. 

Tea or coffee made hot (not at all scorched), before 
water is added, are more fragrant and stronger. Thus, 
by putting three spoonfuls of tea in the pot and setting 
in a warm place before infusing, it will be as strong as 
if you make tea with four spoonfuls without warming it, 
and much more fragrant. 

Vegetables that are strong caa be made much milder 
5* 105 



io6 Culture and Cooking, 

by tying a bit of bread in a clean rag and boiling it with 
them. 

Bread dough is just as good made the day before it is 
used ; thus, a small family can have fresh bread one day, 
rolls the next, by putting the dough in a cold place en- 
yeloped in a damp cloth. In winter, kept cold, yet not 
in danger of freezing, it will keep a week. 

Celery seed takes the place of celery for soup or stews 
when it is scarce ; parsley seed of parsley. 

Green beans, gherkins, etc., put down when plentiful 
in layers of rock salt, will keep crisp and green for 
months, and can be taken out and pickled when con- 
venient. 

Lemon or orange peel grated and mixed with powdered 
sugar and a squeeze of its own juice (the sugar making 
it into paste) is excellent to keep for flayoring ; put it 
into a little pot and it will keep for a year. 

Bread that is very stale may be made quite fresh for 
an hour or two by dipping it quickly into milk or water, 
and putting it in a brisk oven till quite hot tliroicgli. It 
must be eaten at once, or it will be as stale as ever when 
cold. 

Meat to be kept in warm weather should be rubbed over 
with salad oil, every crevice filled with ginger ; meat that 
is for roasting or frying is much better preserved in this 
way than with salt ; take care that every part of the sur- 
face has a coat of oil. Steaks or chops cut ofP, which 
always keep badly, should be dipped into warm butter or 
even dripping, if oil is not handy (the object being to 
exclude the air), and then hung up till wanted. 

Mutton in cold weather '^hould be hung four or five 
wrecks in a place not subject to changes of temperature, 
and before it is so hung, every crevice filled with ginger

and thorougUy dredged with flour, which must be then 
rubbed in with the hand till the surface is quite dry. 
This is the English fashion of keeping venison. 

It may be useful for those who burn kerosene to know 
that when their lamps smell, give a bad light, and smoke, 
it is not necessary to buy new burners. Put the old 
ones in an old saucepan with water and a tablespoonful 
of soda, let them boil half an hour, wipe them, and 
your trouble will be over. 

Meat that has become slightly tainted may be quite 
restored by washing it in water in which is a teaspoonful 
of borax, cutting away every part in the least discolored. 

In summer when meat comes from the butcher's, if it 
is not going to be used the same day, it should be washed 
over with vinegar. 

Poultry in summer should always have a piece of 
charcoal tied in a rag placed in the stomach, to be re- 
moved before cooking. Pieces of charcoal should also 
be put in the refrigerator and changed often. 

Oyster shells put one at a time in a stove that is 
'^clinkered" will clean the bricks entirely. They 
should be put in when the fire is burning brightly. 

Salt and soapstone powder (to be bought at the drug- 
gist's) mend fire brick ; use equal quantities, make into a 
paste with water, and cement the brick ; they will be as 
strong as new ones. 

Ink spilled on carpets may be entirely removed by 
rubbing while wet with blotting paper, using fresh as 
it soils. 



CHAPTER XVI. 

01^ SOME TABLE PKEJUDICES. 

Many people have strong prejudices against certain 
things which they have never even tasted, or which they 
do frequently take and like as a part of something else, 
without knowing it. How common it is to hear and 
see untraveled people declare that they dislike garlic, 
and could not touch anything with it in. Yet those 
very people will take Worcestershire sauce, in which gar- 
lic is actually predominant, with everything they eat ; 
and think none but English pickles eatable, which 
owe much of their excellence to the introduction of a 
soupQon of garlic. Therefore I beg those who actually 
only know garlic from hearsay abuse of it, or from its 
presence on the breath of some inveterate garlic eater, 
to give it a fair trial when it appears in a recipe. It is 
just one of those things that require the most delicate 
handling, for which the French term a " suspicion " is 
most appreciated ; it should only be a suspicion, its 
presence should never be pronounced. As Blot once 
begged his readers, "Give garlic a fair trial in a remo- 
lade sauce." (Montpellier butter beaten into mayonnaise 
is a good remolade for cold meat or fish.) 

Curry is one of those things against which many are 
strongly prejudiced, and I am. inclined to think it is 

108 



On Some Table Prejudices. 109 

quite an acquired taste, but a taste which is an envi- 
able one to its possessors ; for them there is endless 
variety in all they eat. The capabilities of curry are 
very little known in this country, and, as the taste for 
it is so limited, I will not do more in its defense than 
indicate a pleasant use to which it may be put, and in 
which form it would be a welcome condiment to many 
to whom ''a curry," pure and simple, would be obnox- 
ious. I once knew an Anglo-Indian who used curry as 
most people use cayenne ; it was put in a pepper-box, 
and with it he would at times pepper his fish or kidneys, 
even his eggs. Used in this way, it imparts a delightful 
piquancy to food, and is neither hot nor " spicy." 

Few people are so prejudiced as the English generally, 
and the stay-at-home Americans ; but the latter are to 
be taught by travel, the Englishman rarely. 

The average Briton leaves his island shores with the 
conviction that he will get nothing fit to eat till he gets 
back, and that he will have to be uncommonly careful 
once across the channel, or he will be having fricasseed 
frogs palmed on him for chicken. Poor man! in his 
horror of frogs, he does not know that the Paris res- 
taurateur who should give the costly frog for chicken, 
would soon end in the bankruptcy court. 

" If I could only get a decent dinner, a good roast 
and plain potato, I would like Paris much better," said 
an old Englishman to me once in that gay city. 

*'But surely you can." 

*^No ; I have been to restaurants of every class, and 
called for beefsteak and roast beef, but have never got 
the real article, although it's my belief," said he, lean- 
ing forward solemnly, **that I have eaten liorse three 
times this week." Of course the Englishman of rank. 



no Culture and Cooking. 

who has spent half his life on the continent, is not at all 
the average Englishman. 

Americans think the hare and rabbits, of which the 
English make such good nse, very mean food indeed, 
and if they are unprejudiced enough to try them, from 
the fact that they are never well cooked, they dislike 
them, which prejudice the English reciprocate by look- 
ing on squirrels as being as little fit for food as a rat. 
And a familiar instance of prejudice from ignorance 
carried even to insanity, is that of the Irish in 1848, 
starving rather than eat the "yaller male," sent them 
by generous American sympathizers ; yet they come here 
and soon get over that dislike. Kot so the Erench, who 
look on oatmeal and Indian meal as most unwholesome 
food. " (^a pese sur Vestomac, <;a creuse Vestomac" I 
heard an old Frenchwoman say, trying to dissuade a 
mother from giving her children mush. 

The moral of all of which is, that for our comfort's 
sake, and the general good we should avoid unreason- 
able prejudices against unfamiliar food. We of course 
have a right to our honest dislikes ; but to condemn 
things because we have heard them despised, is pre- 
judice. 



CHAPTER XVII. 

A CHAPTER OF ODDS AND Ei^DS — VALEDICTORY. 

I HAVE alluded, in an earlier chapter, to the fact that 
many inexperienced cooks are afraid of altering recipes ; 
a few words on this subject may not be out of place. As 
a rule, a recipe should be faithfully followed in all im- 
portant points ; for instance, in making soup you can- 
not, because you are short of the given quantity of meat, 
put the same amount of water as directed for the full 
quantity, without damaging your soup ; but you may eas- 
ily reduce water and every other ingredient in the same 
proportion ; and, in mere matters of flavoring, you may 
vary to suit circumstances. If you are told to use cloves, 
and have none, a bit of mace may be substituted. 

If you read a recipe, and it calls for something you 
have not, consider whether that something has anything 
to do with the substance of the dish, or whether it is 
merely an accessory for which something else can be 
substituted. For instance, if you are ordered to use 
cream in a sauce, milk with a larger amount of well- 
washed butter may take its place ; but if you are told to 
use cream for charlotte russe or trifles, there is no way in 
which you could make milk serve, since it is not an 
accessory but the chief part of those dishes. For a 
cake in which cream is used, butter whipped to a cream 
may take its place. "Wine is usually optional in savory 
dishes ; it gives richness only.

Again, in cakes be very careful tlie exact proportions 
of flour, eggs, and milk are observed ; of butter you can 
generally use more or less, having a more or less rich 
cake in proportion. In any but plain cup cakes (which 
gi*eatly depend on soda and acid for their lightness) 
never lessen the allowance of eggs ; never add milk if a 
cake is too stiff (but an extra Qgg may always be used), 
unless milk is ordered in the recipe, when more or less 
may be used as needed. Flavoring may be always varied. 

In reducing a recipe always reduce every ingredient, 
and it can make no difference in the results. Some- 
times, in cookery books, you are told to use articles not 
frequently found in ordinary kitchens ; for instance, a 
larding- needle (although that can be bought for twenty- 
five cents at any house-furnishiug store, and should al- 
ways be in a kitchen) ; but, in case you have not one for 
meat, you may manage by making small cuts and insert- 
mg slips of bacon. 

Another article that is very useful, but seldom, if ever, 
to be found in small kitchens, is a salamander ; but when 
you wish to brown the top of a dish, and putting it in 
the oven would not do, or the oven is not quick enough 
to serve, an iron shovel, made nearly red, and a few red 
cinders in it, is a very good salamander. It must be 
held over the article that requires browning near enough 
to color it, yet not to burn. 

In the recipes I have given nothing is required that 
cannot be obtained, with more or less ease, in New York. 
For syrups, fruit juices, etc., apply to your druggist; if 
he has not them he will tell you where to obtain them. 
We often make up our minds that because a thiug is not 
commonly used in this country, it is impossible to get it. 
Keally there are very few things not to be got in New

York City to the intelligent seeker. You need an arti- 
cle of French or Italian or may be English grocery, that 
your grocer, a first-class one, perhaps, has not, and you 
make up your mind you cannot get it. But go into the 
quarters where French people live, and you can get 
eyerything belonging to the French cuisine. So preju- 
diced are the French in favor of the productions of la 
telle France, that they do not believe in our parsley or 
our chives or garlic or shallots ; for I know at least one 
French grocer who imports them for his customers. On 
being asked why he brought them from France to a 
country where those very things were plentiful, he an- 
swered : 

^^Oh, French herbs are much finer." 

Needless to say tarragon is one of the herbs so import- 
ed, and can thus be bought ; but, as several ISTew Jersey 
truck gardeners grow all kinds of French herbs, they can 
be got in Washington Market, and most druggists keep 
them dried ; but for salads, Montpellier butter, and some 
other uses, the dried herb would not do, although for 
flavoring it would serve ; but the far better way is to 
grow them for yourself, as I have done. Any large 
seedsman will supply you with burnet, tarragon, and 
borage (very useful for salads, punch, etc.) seeds, and if 
you live in the country, have an herb bed ; if in town, 
there are few houses where there is not ground enough 
to serve for the purpose ; but even in these few houses 
one can have a box of earth in the kitchen window, in 
which your seeds will flourish. 

Parsley is a thing in almost daily request in winter, 

yet it is very expensive to buy it constantly for the sake 

of using the small spray that often suffices. It is a good 

plan, therefore, in fall, to get a few roots, plant them in

a pot or box, and they will flourish all winter, if kept 
where they will not freeze, and be ready for garnishing 
at any minute. 

Always, as far as your means allow, have every con- 
venience for cooking. By having ntensils proper for 
every purpose you save a great deal of work and much 
vexation of spirit. Yet it should be no excuse for bad 
work that such utensils are not at hand. A willing and 
intelligent cook will make the best of what she has. 
Apropos of this very thing Gouffe relates that a friend 
of his, an ^^ artist" of renown, was sent for to the 
chateau of a Baron Argenteuil, who had taken a large 
company with him, unexpectedly crowding the chateau 
in every part. He was shown into a dark passage in 
which a plank was suspended from the ceiling, and told 
this was to be his kitchen. He had to fashion his own 
utensils, for there was nothing provided, and his pastry 
he had to bake in a frying-pan— besides building two 
monumental j)lcds on that board— and prepare a cold en- 
tree. But he cheerfully set to, work to overcome diffi- 
culties, achieved his task, and was rewarded by the plau- 
dits of the diners. Such difficulties as these our servants 
never have to encounter, and a cheerful endeavor to 
make the best of everything should be the rule. Yet, 
let us spare them all the labor we can, or rather make it 
as easy and pleasant as possible ; they will be more 
proud of their well-furnished kitchen, more cheerful in 
it, than they will of one where everything for their con- 
venience is grudged, and such pride and cheerfulness 
will be your gain. 

There is always a great deal of talk about servants in 
America, how bad and inefficient they are, how badly 
they contrast with those of England. Certainly, they 



Chapter of Odds and Ends — Valedictory. 115 

are not so efficient as those of the older country ; how 
could they be ? There, girls who are intended for servants 
haye ever held before their eyes what they may or may 
not do in the future calling, and how it is to be done. 
But take one of these orderly, efficient girls, put her in 
an American family ^s general servant or as cook, where 
two are kept, washing and ironing to do, and a variety 
of other work, and see how your English servant would 
stare at your requirements. She has been accustomed to 
her own line of work at home ; if housemaid, she has 
been dressed for the day at noon ; if cook, she has never 
done even her own washing. 

She may, and will no doubt, fall into the way of the 
country, after a while, and on account of her early habits 
of respect, will make a good servant perhaps. But many 
of them would be quite indignant at being asked to do 
the average servant's work here. I am speaking now of 
the trained servants ; but, comparing the London " maid- 
of -all-work" or ^^ slavey " with our own general servants, 
and considering how much more is expected of the latter, 
the comparison seems to me vastly in the favor of our own 
Bridgets. We may rest assured, however smoothly the 
wheels of household management glide along in wealthy 
families across the water, people who can only keep one 
or two have all our troubles with servants and a few 
added, and their faults are just as general a subject of 
conversation among ladies. 

France (out of Paris, from Parisian servants deliver 
me ! ) and Germany seem the favored lands where one 
servant does the work of three or four. Yet even they, 
are, they say, degenerating. Let us, then, be contented 
and make the best of what we have, assured that even 
Biddy is not so hopeless as she is painted. Kindness

(not weakness), firmness, and patience work wonders, 
eA^en with the roughest Emerald that ever crossed the 
sea. 

I have said somewhere else that you must beware of at- 
tempting too much at once ; perfect yourself in one thing 
before you attempt another. Take breaded chops or 
fried oysters, make opportunities for having them rather 
often, and do not rest satisfied until you have them as 
well fried as you haye ever seen them anywhere ; " prac- 
tice makes perfect," and you certainly will achieve per- 
fection if you are not discouraged by one failure. But 
above all things never make experiments for company ; 
let them be made when it really matters little whether 
you succeed or not, and let your experiments be on a 
small scale ; don't attempt to fry a large dish of oysters 
or chops until it is a very easy task, or make more than 
half a pound of puff paste at first ; for if you fail with a 
large task before you, you will be tired and disheartened, 
hate the sight of what you are doing, and, as a conse- 
quence, not be likely to return to it very soon. The same 
may be said of cooks ; some of them are very fond of ex- 
periments, which taste I should always encourage ; but do 
not let them jump from one experiment to the other ; 
if they try a dish and fail, they often make up their 
minds that the fault is not theirs, that it is not worth 
while to '^ bother " with it. Here your knowledge will be 
of service ; you will show them that it can be done, how 
it should be done, and order the dish cook failed in, fre- 
quently, giving it sufiicient surveillance to prevent your 
family suffering from her inexperience ; for, as a witty 
Frenchman said of Mme. du Deffaud's cook, "Between 
her and Brinvilliers there is only the difference of in- 
tention." 



Chapter of Odds and Ends — Valedictory, 1 1 7 

Few things add more to a man or woman's social repu- 
tation than the fact that they keep a good table. It 
need not be one where 

" The strong table gi'Ocans 
Beneath the smoking sirloin stretched immense ; " 

but a table where whatever you do have will be good, 
be it pork and beans, or salmi ; the pork and beans 
would satisfy a Bostonian, the salmi Grimod de la Rey- 
niere himself. I do not admit with Di Walcott that 

*' The turnpike road to people's hearts I find 
Lies through their mouths, or I mistake mankind." 

But it is a fact that good living — by this I do not 
mean extravagant living — presupposes good breeding. 
"Well-bred people sometimes live badly ; but ill-bred 
people seldom or ever live well, in the right sense of 
the term. 

Now, by way of valedictory, let me repeat that I do 
not think a lady's best or proper place is the kitchen ; 
but it is quite possible to have a perfectly served table, 
yet spend very little time there. Only that one little 
hour a day that Talleyrand, the busy man full of intrigue 
and statecraft, found time to spend with his cook, would 
insure your table being well served. For, after devoting 
say a few winter months to perfecting yourself in a few 
things, you will be able to teach your cook, who is often 
ambitious to excel if put in the right way. A word here 
about cooks. 

The knowledge that if they fail to do a thing well 
you will do it yourself, will often put them on their 
mettle to do their best ; while the feeling that you don't 
know, will make them careless. 



Ii8 Culture and Cooking. 

Servants have a great deal more amour propre than 
people imagine ; therefore, stimulate it by judicious 
praise and appreciation ; let them think that to send in a 
dish perfect, is a glory to themselves as well as a pleasure 
to you. While careful to remark when alone with them 
upon any fault that results from carelessness, be equally 
careful to give all the praise you can, and repeat to 
them complimentary remarks that may have been made 
on their skill. Servants are usually — such is the weak- 
ness of feminine nature, whether in the drawing-room 
or the kitchen — very sensitive to the praise or blame of 
the gentlemen of the family. Indulge poor humanity a 
little when you honestly can.
