INTRODUCTION 

The principal function of this volume is to present our newer knowl- 
edge of food preparation and cookery processes from a chemical and physi- 
cal basis, particularly that of colloid chemistry. In doing this, many results 
secured from experimental work along these lines at Iowa State College 
have been included. A condensed arrangement of the data on cookery, 
which are found in widely scattered sources, has been included also. 

Many of the sciences serve as a foundation or basis for food prepara- 
tion. Inorganic, organic, physical, and plant chemistry, as well as physics 
and other sciences, are necessary for an adequate understanding of many 
processes in food preparation. But the subject matter herein covered is 
perhaps more closely related to physical chemistry and the branch of 
physical chemistry known as colloid chemistry. In fact, so many of the 
ingredients used in food preparation are colloidal in nature that food 
preparation may be classed as one field of applied colloid chemistry. As 
a phase of colloid chemistry it offers a vast field for exploration, for 
although commercially prepared foods have been studied extensively the 
problems in connection with their preparation are far from completed. 
Work along other lines of cookery has hardly started. Some of the older 
work on cookery needs to be repeated and explained in the light of newer 
interpretations of science. 

Because the majority of home economics students have had no oppor- 
tunity to take even an elementary course in physical or colloid chemistry, 
it becomes necessary to present a simple outline and explanation of col- 
loid chemistry in its relation to food preparation. Since this is the founda- 
tion material for this treatise it seems logical to present it first. But to 
many persons this is the newest and perhaps the most difficult subject 
matter in relation to food preparation. Therefore, it is probably better for 
the student to commence with the chapters on sugar cookery, freezing, and 
fruits and vegetables, referring only to the few paragraphs in Chapter I 
needed to understand some of the factors of sugar cookery and freezing. 
A fundamental understanding of sugar cookery and freezing preparation 
processes is based largely upon the portion of physical chemistry dealing 
with solutions, vapor pressure, the boiling point, and the freezing point. 
This material is outlined in these chapters. But to present the material 
on colloid chemistry in such a manner in every chapter would lead to 
many repetitions and make the book unduly long. Hence this material is 
summarized in Chapter I, although the author realized that it would prob- 
ably be necessary to review or to present portions of this chapter in connec- 
tion with subsequent ones. 



X INTRODUCTION 

Many contradictory observations are often made in cookery. This is 
to be expected, particularly when the materials used are in a colloidal 
state. Unless the constituents of food products are present in the same 
amount, and, even if present in the same proportion, if the colloidal 
particles are not the same size, if the previous treatment, including the 
thermal and mechanical treatment and the time element, is not exactly 
duplicated, then even an elementary knowledge of colloid chemistry leads 
one to expect different results in finished products, because of variation 
of these different factors. It is not possible to control all these factors. For 
instance, the variation in ash content of flour, eggs, milk, meat, fruits, and 
vegetables is nearly always beyond our control. But the necessity for a 
detailed description of the technic and method followed in reporting 
results is obvious. Detailed directions in writing the laboratory outline 
are essential or the technics followed may vary so much that the results 
are worthless for comparisons. It is of course understood that adequate 
explanations cannot be offered for all cookery processes. In some instances 
it is necessary to determine the results time after time and let the theory 
fit the laboratory facts. In other cases the explanations offered will need 
to be changed, modified, or replaced by data obtained from future investi- 
gations. 

In starting the laboratory work the author asks her students to assume 
the attitude that every result obtained is right. If it is not as expected, 
what are the reasons? For example, a burned, charred product results from 
certain procedures. If, when students have used the same proportions, the 
same ingredients, and tried to follow the same technic, the individual 
results differ, what are the possible interpretations for the divergence? In 
the same manner the reported results of other investigators are taken as 
correct. If the students' laboratory results do not always agree with 
reported results, interest comes in comparing methods used, the ingredients 
used, their proportion, and the technic followed, to find explanations for 
agreement or disagreement. 

It is hoped that this volume will fill a need for a textbook for discus- 
sion material for food-preparation courses in colleges and as a reference 
work for teachers of secondary schools. It is also hoped that the reference 
to and summary of articles in the literature will create an interest on 
the part of the student to read and interpret them for herself. 

Food-preparation study in colleges may include courses designated as 
experimental cookery. The material in this book may be given in such 
courses. The manual "Food Preparation Studies" by Child-Niles-Kolshorn 
will also be an aid in these courses. 

To some the term experimental cookery implies only a method of 
presenting material. Such is not the use of the expression in this volume. 
It is used to designate a certain field of subject matter relating to food 
preparation. The laboratory outline included in this volume is arranged 
to present this subject matter as far as possible. 



INTRODUCTION xi 

What constitutes or should constitute experimental-cookery courses 
cannot be answered fully at the present time. They are of necessity rapidly 
developing and changing. The author believes that eventually they vs^ill 
have the same relation to food-preparation courses that those in animal 
feeding have to nutrition courses. 

The author takes this opportunity to acknowledge with appreciation 
the comments of Dr. P. Mabel Nelson, Florence Busse Smith, Alma 
Plagge, Viola M. Bell, and the other members of the Foods and Nutrition 
staff of Iowa State College. The aid of Dr. Amy Le Vesconte for many 
/>H determinations is also acknowledged. 

To Dr. E. A. Benbrook and Margaret Sloss of the Veterinary Depart- 
ment the author is indebted for aid in taking photo-micrographs. 

For reading portions of the manuscript and for the suggestions they 
have offered, the author is also indebted to Dr. E. I. Fulmer (the chapter 
on the Relation of Cookery to Colloid Chemistry) ; to Prof. M. Mortensen 
and Prof. C. E. Iverson (the chapter on Freezing) ; to Dr. R. M. Hixon 
(the chapter on Fruits and Vegetables) ; to Dr. Paul E. Howe and Prof. 
M. D. Helser (the chapter on Meat) ; to Prof. M. Mortensen, Dr. E. 
W. Bird, and Dr. B. W. Hammer (the chapter on Milk) ; and to Ethan 
E. Hoovler (the entire book). 

To the many students in her "Experimental Foods" classes who through 
their interest and enthusiasm have always been a stimulus to further work, 
the author wishes to express her most grateful appreciation. 



EXPERIMENTAL COOKERY 



CHAPTER I 

THE RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID 
CHEMISTRY 

The early lines of food work cannot be expressed better than in the 
words of Ostwald (1922). "Scientific study of the field still contents itself 
with chapters on analysis and the recognition of adulterants, but chapters 
dealing with the preparation of food are hardly started. Much as every one 
would like to obtain better food for less money, study of such questions 
is regarded as menial and best left to the cook. A scientific study of the 
preparation of food is considered as only amusing even in scientific circles." 
Later Ostwald remarks that the chapters that are missing in food prepa- 
ration are the ones to which colloid chemistry may be applied. 

Since so many phases of food preparation are based on colloid chemistry 
it seems necessary to include in this book a chapter on its relation to cook- 
ery. It is a short and brief outline. As such, it can be used as an intro- 
duction or as a summary or for both introduction and summary of the 
work on food preparation, although the subsequent chapters have been 
written with the idea that at least portions of this chapter will be used 
in connection with each of them. 

Thomas Graham's contributions constitute the foundations of colloid 
chemistry. His most important results were published between 1861 and 
1864. But it is only since the publications of von Weimarn and of Ostwald 
in 1906 and 1907 that rapid development has been made in colloid chem- 
istry, and it is an even shorter time since the most extensive applications 
of it have been made to food preparation. Graham used the terms 
crystalloids and colloids to apply to definite materials. Crystalloids were 
dialyzable through parchment membrane, whereas colloids were not dialyz- 
able. The terms are now misleading, for we know that any crystalloid can, 
by a definite treatment and the selection of the right medium, be brought 
into the colloidal state. Many of the so-called colloids can be crystallized. 
The term colloidal state indicates that the material is dispersed in another 
substance, so that it is preferable to speak of colloidal systems rather than 
colloids. Colloidal systems differ from molecular ones in the size of the 
dispersed particles. This difference in size of the particles gives different 
physical properties to the system. 

Bancroft states that "adopting the very flexible definition that a phase 

1 



2 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

is called colloidal when it is sufficiently finely divided, colloid chemistry 
is the chemistry of bubbles, drops, grains, filaments, and films, because in 
each of these cases at least one dimension of the phase is very small. This is 
not a truly scientific classification because a bubble has a film round it, 
and a film may be considered as made up of coalescing drops or grains." 
A knowledge of colloid chemistry is necessary to have a real understanding 
of processes and methods used in a large number of industries and occupa- 
tions. Bancroft gives a list of 60 such occupations, which include: "cream, 
butter, cheese, and casein products; cooking and washing." 

Classification of Substances Based upon the Degree of Dispersion 

in Solution 

Solutions and suspensions. When a solid substance is added to a 
liquid one of three types of mixtures may be formed. ( 1 ) A true solution, 
which is a homogeneous mixture. (2) A colloidal solution, which appears 
to be homogeneous. The dispersed particles have a size of 1 m/x to 0.1/x and 
can be separated by a sufficiently fine filter. (3) A suspension in which 
the dispersed particles are greater than OA[x. The dispersed particles can 
be separated from the liquid by filtration or sedimentation. Gortner 
states, "Inasmuch as fine suspensions possess, to a large degree, certain 
characteristic properties of colloidal systems, there has been a general tend- 
ency of recent years to raise the upper limit to 0.5/x," instead of OA/x. It 
should be understood that the above classification is an arbitrary one and 
that in nature there are no abrupt transitions. There can be no definite 
division made between true and colloidal solutions for the transition is 
gradual. There are some colloidal solutions known in which the dispersed 
particles are less than 1 m/x. There is also no line of demarcation between 
colloidal solutions and suspensions. 

In true solutions the dispersed phase consists of particles of molecular 
or ionic size, whereas the colloidal solutions contain particles of larger size, 
and the suspension contains particles large enough for mechanical separation. 
The smaller the particles with a definite quantity of material the more 
dispersed the substance; the larger the particles the less dispersed. A true 
solution can be reproduced if the temperature, pressure, and concentration 
are known, since the degree of dispersion is constant. But in colloidal solu- 
tions it is necessary to know the degree of dispersion as well as the tem- 
perature, pressure, and concentration to reproduce the system. The prop- 
erties of solutions like gelatin also depend upon the method of preparation 
and their previous history; the properties of a true solution are independent 
of the method of preparation or their previous history. The systems whose 
properties are dependent upon their previous history are said to show 
hysteresis. 

Colloidal systems are heterogeneous, so that it is necessary to distinguish 
which is the dispersed phase and which is the dispersing medium. Some of 



SOLUTIONS AND SUSPENSIONS 



the terms used are dispersed phase and dispersing medium* discontinuous 
phase and continuous phase ; internal phase and external phase ; and micelles 
and intermicellar liquid. The usage of the last group appears to be in- 
creasing at the present time.

Particles of colloidal size may be in a gaseous, liquid, or a solid state. 
These micelles may be dispersed in solids, liquids, or gases; and if sys- 
tems are classified according to the dispersed and dispersing medium there 
may be a 

solid in a solid, ruby glass; 

liquid in a solid, opals ; 

gas in a solid, pumice ; 

solid in a liquid, gold sol ; 

liquid in a liquid, lyophilic colloids; 

gas in a liquid, whipped cream ; 

solid in a gas, smoke; 

liquid in a gas, fog. 



4 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

Sometimes the classification of colloidal systems is based on the dispersed 
phase only, and this is designated as a solid, liquid, or a gas, according to 
the material dispersed. Gortner adds emulsions to the above eight systems 
to be considered in colloidal systems. 

Dispersion of substances. It is possible to change particles from 
molecular size to suspension particles and vice versa. Ostwald states that 
"it may be accomplished either through the dispersion of nondispersed or 
coarsely dispersed substances, or through the condensation of molecularly 
dispersed systems. To these ends not only chemical but mechanical, elec- 
trical and other kinds of energy may be used." Water passes from the molec- 
ular through the colloidal and into the suspension state in freezing. Von 
Weimarn states that all crystalline substances pass through a colloidal 
zone in going into solution and in crystallizing from solution, for during 
crystallization the size of the particles increases, passing from molecular, 
through colloidal, to suspension dimensions. This emphasizes the fact that, 
within each group or class of substances, there may be a wide variation 
in the degree of dispersion. This dispersion, as in crystallization, may pass 
through molecular, colloidal, and suspension zones, w^hereas with other 
substances there may be wide degrees of dispersion of the substance 
within one zone. The properties of the systems vary w^ith the size and 
degree of dispersion of their particles, which affect the results obtained in 
cookery. The properties of colloidal particles approaching molecular dis- 
persion are different from those of particles approaching the suspension 
zone. One illustration will be mentioned. The gluten particles of flour 
have colloidal dimensions. According to Gortner and Doherty, not all 
gluten particles from different flours are the same size. The gluten particles 
in pastry flour are more dispersed or of smaller size than those in bread 
flour. This is one reason for the different results obtained in baked foods 
when bread flour is used instead of pastry flour. The properties and bak- 
ing qualities of different flours vary with the size of the gluten particles. 

Particles approaching the limits of the size of one zone may show prop- 
erties of two zones. Thus sugar has a high molecular weight and in cookery 
shows both molecular and colloidal properties as if it belonged to an in- 
between group. In gelatin dishes with a definite concentration it increases 
the stiffness of the gel ; in custards it acts like a protective colloid. 

Increasing and Lessening the Degree of Dispersion of 
Substances in Food Preparation 

In food preparation many of the methods used and many of the in- 
gredients added to foods bring about increased or decreased dispersion. 

Heat. Increasing the temperature may bring about a greater or a lesser 
degree of dispersion. The heating of water increases its dispersion. The dis- 
persion of fat globules in milk is increased by the application of heat to 



DISPERSION BY ALKALIES 5 

the milk, but when proteins are coagulated by heat the degree of dispersion 
is decreased. 

Mechanical dispersion. Beating of a food is a mechanical means of 
bringing about a greater or a lesser degree of dispersion. In cookery, stir- 
ring may bring about more uniform distribution of particles in a food, 
like white sauce. But even this may prevent lumping or clumping and thus 
is a means of bringing about dispersion, just as beating a curdled custard 
is a mechanical means of bringing about a greater degree of dispersion of 
a suspension, but although it reduces the size of the curds it does not reduce 
them enough to change the suspension to the colloidal state. Homogenization 
of milk or cream is a mechanical means of increasing the dispersion of fat 
particles. Beating an egg white is a mechanical means of lessening the 
degree of dispersion, as it brings about partial coagulation of the egg white 
in the cell walls surrounding the air bubbles. 

Dispersion by acids. The addition or the development of acid in 
preparation of food may be a chemical means of bringing about a greater or 
a lesser degree of dispersion. For instance, the development of acid during 
the fermentation of bread brings about greater dispersion of the gluten. 
The addition of acid to whole egg tends to curdle the egg or bring about a 
lessened degree of dispersion. If a large enough quantity of acid is added, 
the degree of dispersion may be increased after passing through a zone 
of lesser dispersion. The explanation of the different effects of acid on the 
gluten and on the egg proteins depends upon the isoelectric point of the 
gluten and the egg protein and the degree of acidity developed. This will 
be considered later. 

Dispersion by alkalies. The addition of alkalies may also tend to 
bring about a greater or a lesser degree of dispersion. In quick breads and 
cakes the addition of soda in excess of the amount required to neutralize 
the acidity of the mixture may bring about increased dispersion of the 
gluten particles, which results in a definite grain or crumb. 

The different methods of bringing about a lesser or a greater degree of 
dispersion are applicable to all food products. In some cases the effect may 
be modified by other factors. It is interesting to trace these through dif- 
ferent classes of food products. If alkali is taken as an example, its effects 
on some foods may be cited. The alkalies, hydroxides of ammonia, sodium, 
and potassium or their basic salts are the ones considered. Calcium and 
magnesium salts may have different effects. 

Sucrose is little affected by alkalies if they are not stronger than those 
ordinarily used in cookery. But when alkalies are added to the mono- 
saccharid sugars they bring about decomposition. The sugar in solution is 
in the molecular state, and the alkalies cause increased dispersion, even 
though the sugar and its decomposition products both remain in molecular 
dispersion. The properties of the decomposition products are different 
from those of the original sugar. 

Vegetables and fruits are softened by the addition of alkalies during 



6 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

cooking, and they may become mushy and disintegrate. This is probably 
due to the greater dispersion of the cellulose and pectic substances. In dried 
legumes, alkalies may also increase the disintegration of some of the protein. 

Milk is prevented from curdling or coagulating by the addition of alkali. 
Curdling is a lessened dispersion of the milk protein, casein. The addition of 
alkalies to eggs elevates the temperature for coagulation. Alkalies added 
to doughs cause a greater degree of dispersion of the gluten, which results 
in a dough that is runny and sticky to handle. In larger quantities the bak- 
ing quality of the flour is partially destroyed. Alkalies added to gelatin 
tend to prevent its setting, and they may cause greater dispersion in emul- 
sions. 

Dispersion by enzymes. Enzymes may also cause an increased or 
lessened degree of dispersion in foods. The clotting of milk upon the ad- 
dition of rennin is an example of lessened dispersion, but the proteinase 
enzyme in flour increases the dispersion of the gluten. 

Classification and Properties of Colloids Based upon 
Physico-Chemical Relationships in Liquids 

Each colloidal solution as w^ell as each true solution has its own peculiar 
properties. These depend upon the nature of the particles in solution and 
the dispersing medium. But a large group of colloidal systems may have 
similar properties, and for convenience they are classified in a group or 
subdivision. The classification of colloidal systems into groups is not 
always satisfactory, for there is no distinct line of demarcation between 
the different subdivisions. Ostwald, Freundlich, Gortner, and Buchanan 
and Fulmer give excellent discussions of the properties of colloidal systems 
which are of interest to those concerned with food preparation. 

Suspensoids and emulsoids. One basis for classification of colloidal 
systems is the nature of the dispersed phase. In a suspensoid the dispersed 
particles are in a solid state. In an emulsoid the dispersed particles are in a 
liquid state. Many authorities classify suspensoids and lyophobes, emulsoids 
and lyophiles, as being coextensive, but Freundlich states that this is in- 
correct, for there are many emulsoids with lyophobic properties. 

Reversible and irreversible colloids. If after a colloidal solution is 
evaporated, a sol is reformed upon the addition of water, the colloid is 
classified as a reversible colloid. Gelatin and dried egg white are examples 
of this type of colloid. An irreversible colloid does not spontaneously form 
a sol with the addition of water, after water has been evaporated. Re- 
versible and hydrophilic colloids are coextensive; irreversible and hydro- 
phobic colloids belong to similar groups. 

Sols and gels. Colloidal solutions are also classified upon the basis 
of their consistency. Those which are apparently solutions are called sols. 
Those with a jelly-like consistency are called gels. The consistency of fruit 
jelly or a gelatin dessert is that of a typical gel. There is no distinct line 



SWELLING OF COLLOIDAL GELS 7 

of separation between sols and gels, nor on the other hand, according to 
Jordan Lloyd, between gels and curds. The classification of gels on the 
basis of consistency includes many gels that do not have similar proper- 
ties. Some gels are formed from sols by coagulation. Custard is an ex- 
ample of this type. A starch gel is formed by gelatinization of the starch 
during cooking. Gelatin, agar-agar, and soaps form sols above certain 
temperatures and gels at lower temperatures. Such gels are called revers- 
ible. The sol-gel transformation is brought about gradually, there being 
no definite melting or setting temperature. The change from a sol to a gel 
by cooling is termed gelation and is a distinct process from that of coagu- 
lation. Temperature, time, concentration, and the presence of electrolytes 
or non-electrolytes are factors in gel formation. There are various theories 
regarding gel structure, but space does not permit considering them here. 
It may be added that there is a similarity between crystallization and 
gelation. Jordan Lloyd states that "gelation is a process closely parallel to 
crystallization and is accompanied in most cases by evolution of heat." One 
other factor of similarity is that with rapid cooling a finer structure of the 
micelles is obtained. 

Swelling of colloidal gels. Freundlich designates the gels that may 
imbibe a liquid and give it up as turgescible, and those which do not swell 
as non-turgescible. The imbibition of water is known as turgescence; the 
giving up of water is designated as deturgescence. The term hydration is 
used to indicate imbibition of water by the micelles ; solvation is the general 
term used for all liquid dispersion mediums. The lyophilic colloids are 
characterized by their affinity for their dispersion mediums. Whether the 
micelles of gelatin, agar-agar, etc., actually act as a solvent for the inter- 
micellar liquid, or whether the liquid is attracted and bound, probably 
by electrical forces, to the surface of the micelle in the form of a shell is 
still a disputed question. The amount of water that can be held by many 
of the micelles in the form of a shell around the particle is relatively enor- 
mous. As the concentration of the micelles is increased, the viscosity of the 
solution increases, owing to a larger portion of the dispersion liquid being 
bound. A concentration of 0.75 per cent of pectin micelles gives a fruit 
jelly of good texture. Increasing their concentration gives a stiffer jelly. 
The molecules of the dispersion medium are probably oriented in a definite 
manner around the micelle, for the volume of a gelatin gel is less than the 
combined volume of the dry gelatin and the water. 

The ability of the micelles to take up and hold water is important in 
food preparation. The thickening of a cup of milk by an egg in a custard 
is due to the ability of the egg proteins to bind the liquid. The thickening 
power of starches is due to the swelling of the starch granules during heat- 
ing. The ability of proteins, starches, etc., to imbibe water is very great. 
A pressure of 2500 atmospheres is required to prevent the swelling of starch 
when it is heated in water. Gortner defines imbibition pressure as "the 
pressure against which such a colloid will imbibe a liquid, or conversely the 



8 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

pressure which is required to force the dispersions medium out of a gel. 
Imbibition pressures should not be confused with osmotic pressure, and in 
many instances they assume values greatly in excess of values obtainable 
by osmotic pressure. If a sheet of dried gelatin is placed in a saturated 
solution of sodium chloride, water will be withdrawn by imbibition forces 
against the osmotic pressure of the sodium chloride solution, and sodium 
chloride will crystallize out in the solution." 

The micelles possess either a positive or a negative charge. When the 
electrical forces holding the bound water to the micelle are neutralized, as 
may happen when electrolytes are added under suitable conditions, the 
bound water is released and the viscosity of the system decreases. When 
a custard is curdled the bound water is set free. The ability of muscle fibers 
to hold water during cooking prevents drying of the meat to a great extent. 

Effect o£ added substances upon swelling of gels. The addition 
of such substances as acids, alkalies, mineral salts, and sugar may increase 
or inhibit the degree of swelling. Many such combinations are made in 
cookery. Lemon juice and vinegar may be added for flavor. Soda, salt, and 
baking powder may be added to foods. Different proportions of mineral 
salts are found in foods, and the proportion may vary in the same food 
owing to many causes. In general, the addition of acids or alkalies increases 
the swelling of colloidal gels. With acids, this usually continues until a 
maximum is reached at pH 3.0 to 2.5, when imbibition is decreased with 
greater acidity. With alkalies the maximum swelling is about pH 10.5, 
though gluten gels are likely to disintegrate when they become as alkaline 
as this. Sometimes the addition of acids or alkalies lessens hydration. This 
depends upon the pH of the substance when the acid or alkali is added. 
In general, salts lessen the degree of swelling even in the presence of acids 
or alkalies. 

Syneresis. After gels are allowed to stand protected against evapora- 
tion for a number of hours there is a tendency for the gel to separate into 
two phases. A liquid may squeeze out of the gel. A typical example is the 
separation of the whey from the curd in clabbered milk. It is also noticed 
in some jellies, cranberry jelly in particular. This separation into a more 
solid and a more liquid part may take a long time in the case of some food 
gels, a shorter time in others. In syneresis the liquid part contains a large 
proportion of the solvent, a smaller proportion of the solid. The more solid 
part has a high concentration of the solid, a lower one of the solvent. 

Hydrophilic and hydrophobic colloids. The terms lyophilic and 
lyophobic include all dispersing mediums whereas hydrophilic and hydro- 
phobic indicate that the dispersing medium is water, Hydrophilic means 
"water loving"; hydrophobic means "water hating." The lyophilic colloids 
belong to the liquid dispersed in liquid systems, thiough as pointed out by 
Gortner and by Fischer this terminology is not strictly accurate, for the 
dispersed phase and dispersing medium are more or less soluble in each 
other. Thus, with gelatin and water, hydration occurs or the two are 



ELECTROLYTES AND HYDROPHOBIC COLLOIDS 9 

mutually more or less soluble in each other. The chief differences between 
hydrophilic and hydrophobic colloids are their degree of hydration and their 
reaction to electrolytes. The particles of a hydrophilic colloid require the 
addition of a large quantity of an electrolyte to bring about coagulation, 
whereas the hydrophobic colloids are sensitive to, and coagulated by, very 
small quantities of electrolytes. Gelatin, agar-agar, starch, and protein solu- 
tions belong to the hydrophilic group; the metal sols belong to the hydro- 
phobic group. There is no distinct line between the hydrophilic and hydro- 
phobic colloids. Even the particles of the rather typical hydrophilic colloids 
are not hydrated to the same extent. Thus an agar-agar sol is more strongly 
hydrated than a gelatin one. Another way of expressing this is to say that 
about 1 per cent of agar-agar will form a stiff gel, but more than 1 per cent 
of gelatin is required for a stiff gel. 

The charge on colloidal particles. That the micelles possess either a 
negative or a positive charge is agreed, though the origin of the charge is 
still disputed. For aqueous solutions the charge is most easily explained on 
the basis of adsorbed ions. The charge may also come from ionization 
of the micelle, or by electrification by contact with the dispersing medium, 
in the same manner that a glass rod becomes charged when rubbed with 
fur. If the charge on the micelles is reduced to practically zero, the col- 
loidal system becomes unstable. The electrical charge is one important 
factor in the stabilization of sols. One example in foods is the casein of 
milk. When the electrical charge of casein reaches zero, the protein floc- 
culates and is precipitated. Kruyt cites it as an example of a protein sol 
that is not sufficiently hydrated to be stabilized by hydration alone, so that 
it can exist when negatively or positively charged, but not when the charge 
is neutralized. 

Freundlich uses the term electrokinetic phenomena to designate certain 
electrical properties of colloidal systems. He also states that these electro- 
kinetic phenomena are closely associated with the physical properties of 
interfacial tension, adsorption, colloidal stability, mutual precipitation, and 
flocculation. 

The theories that have been advanced to explain electrokinetic phenom- 
ena are based upon the double-layer theory of Helmholtz. This theory is 
that the micelle is surrounded by a double layer of ions, the inner layer, 
which may be negative or positive, being closely adsorbed by the micelle, 
and the outer layer, consisting of ions of opposite charge from those of the 
inner layer, lying close to the micelles in the intermicellar liquid. If the 
inner layer of ions is negative, the micelle is negatively charged, the outer 
layer being positively charged. As the colloid passes through its isoelectric 
point the charge of each double layer is reversed. 

Effect o£ electrolytes upon hydrophobic colloids. When a hy- 
drophobic colloid is coagulated by an electrolyte its electric charge is 
removed. The amount of electrolyte required depends upon several factors: 
(1) The manner of adding. More electrolyte is required if it is added in 



10 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

small portions than if added all at once. (2) The valence of the ion bring- 
ing about the coagulation. Coagulation is brought about by the ion having 
the opposite charge to that of the colloid. As a general rule, the precipitat- 
ing effect is increased with an increase of valence of the ion bringing about 
the coagulation. There are exceptions to this rule, as some monovalent ions 
have greater effect in bringing about coagulation than some polyvalent 
ions. (3) Concentration of the electrolyte. In many cases there are zones in 
which a definite concentration of the electrolyte brings about maximum 
coagulation. Higher or lower concentrations are not so effective or may not 
bring about coagulation. This is illustrated later in egg cookery. High con- 
centrations of ferric or aluminum chloride do not bring about coagulation 
of distilled-water custards but small concentrations cause coagulation. 
(4) The concentration of the colloid also affects the amount of electrolyte 
required for coagulation. (5) A definite time may be required, depending 
upon the concentration of the protein and electrolyte. 

Effect of electrolytes upon hydrophilic colloids. The effect of 
electrolytes upon hydrophilic colloids is varied. Kruyt states that the hydro- 
philic colloids are stabilized by two factors, the electric charge and the 
strong hydration of the particles, and after the hydrophilic colloid is 
dehydrated it is as sensitive to electrolytes as the hydrophobic colloids. 
Dehydration of the hydrophilic colloids may be brought about by different 
means. Some proteins may be dehydrated by heating. Alcohol may be 
used to dehydrate hydrophilic colloids, and tannins may also bring about 
dehydration. This dehydration by heating or other means is called denatur- 
ation. If an egg white is dialyzed and the electrolytes removed it is not 
coagulated when heated. But the addition of electrolytes to the heated 
dialyzed egg white brings about coagulation. Kruyt states that if small 
quantities of electrolytes are added to a starch or agar-agar sol the electric 
charge is removed but the colloidal particles do not precipitate. If alcohol, 
a dehydrating agent, is added to the above starch or agar-agar sol, coagu- 
lation occurs. It is immaterial in which order the two stability factors, the 
electric charge and hydration, are removed. The removal of one has no 
evident effect, but the removal of both factors causes coagulation. The term 
denaturation will be used in later references to indicate sensitization of 
hydrophilic colloids to electrolytes. The term denotes whatever changes are 
brought about during dehydration of the colloid. 

The action of electrolytes upon proteins is given as follows by Buchanan 
and Fulmer. 

"1. Those electrolytes which bring about a reversible precipitation 
in high concentration. These include the salts of the alkalis, K, Na, 
NH4, Li and possibly Mg. Ammonium sulphate is commonly used 
in 'salting out' of proteins. The precipitate so formed will be redis- 
solved on dilution, i.e., the process is reversible. 

''When the protein is on the alkaline side of its isoelectric point (i.e., 



ISOELECTRIC POINT 11 

negatively charged), the order of effectiveness of the salt is on the 
basis of cations: Li > K > Na > NH4 > Mg and of anions, citrate 
> tartrate > SO4 > acetate > CI > NO3 > CIO3 > I > SCN. 

"2. Those electrolytes which bring about an irreversible precipita- 
tion in concentrated solutions. These include the salts of alkaline 
earths, Sr, Ba, Ca, and possibly Mg. 

''The order of effectiveness for negatively charged protein is Ba > 
Ca > Sr and acetate > CI > NO3 > Br > I > SCN with the re- 
verse order for the positively charged protein. 

"3. Those electrolytes which in low concentrations bring about an 
irreversible precipitation. These include the salts of the heavy metals 
such as Ag, Hg, Fe, Cu. An interesting characteristic of this group 
is the fact that two optimal zones may be found. For instance, copper 
sulphate solutions precipitate albumin in concentrations from 
0.001 A'^ — 1 A^, in higher concentrations the precipitate redissolves, a 
precipitate appearing again at a concentration of 6 A^. Zinc salts show 
maximal precipitation at 0.01 N — 0.5 N and again at 4 AT." 

Protective and denaturating colloids. A substance that tends to 
prevent coagulation of micelles is designated as a protector; if it is in the 
colloidal state it is called a protective colloid. Sometimes small amounts 
of a colloid sensitize instead of protecting. The latter are sometimes called 
denaturating colloids. 

Amphoteric colloids. Substances that combine with either acids or 
bases are known as amphoteric substances. Proteins belong to this group. 
They are composed of amino acids. The amino acids contain amine 
( — NH2), and carboxyl ( — COOH), groups. The — NHo groups 
combine with acids; the — COOH groups combine with alkalies. Most 
of the — NH2 and — COOH groups are linked or bound in forming the 
protein molecule, but some are free, and combinations with acids and bases 
are formed with these free groups. 

Isoelectric point. At a definite acidity or pH for each protein, there 
is a point called the isoelectric point. The pH of different proteins at the 
isoelectric point varies because of the different amino-acid content of each 
protein, which results in a larger or smaller number of — NH2 or 
— COOH groups. At the isoelectric point the protein is combined with 
neither anions nor cations or else it is combined with both equally, for the 
charge is neutral. Thus at the isoelectric point in a cataphoresis experiment 
the protein does not migrate to either the anode or cathode. At the iso- 
electric point certain characteristic properties of the protein are at a mini- 
mal, i.e., it is most easily precipitated by electrolytes, is least soluble, shows 
the least viscosity, is also less dispersed, and least stable as a colloidal solu- 
tion. Other minimum points at higher acidity or alkalinity than the isoelec- 
tric point are not considered in this discussion, for they are found less 
frequently in food preparation. 



12 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

Combinations o£ proteins with alkalies. At a pR above its iso- 
electric point the protein combines with alkalies to form such salts as 
sodium proteinate, calcium proteinate, etc.

Combination o£ proteins with acids. At a pH below the isoelectric 
point or on the acid side the protein combines with acids to form salts such 
as protein chlorides. Here the effect is additive and similar to the addition 
of hydrochloric acid to ammonia to form ammonium chloride.

Combinations of proteins with acids or alkalies in food prep- 
aration. Many combinations of proteins with acids or alkalies are formed 
in food preparation. Most alkaline salts of the proteins are soluble. Some of 
the acid salts are soluble; others are difficultly soluble. Casein, the protein 
present in milk in the largest quantity, has a pH of 4.7 at its isoelectric 
point. Casein in sweet milk is found as an alkaline salt. Fresh milk has a 
pH of 6 to 7. If an acid is added to the milk the casein will be precipitated 
when the reaction of the milk reaches the isoelectric point of the casein, 
pH 4.7. This occurs in natural souring by the formation of lactic acid 
in the milk. Familiar examples of combinations of acid with milk are the 
addition of lemon juice to milk for sherbet or the addition of tomatoes to 
milk for cream of tomato soup. If enough acid is added to lower the reac- 
tion of the milk below the isoelectric point of the casein, an acid salt is 
formed. If this salt is soluble, the curds of casein will dissolve. This change 
of the protein from an alkaline to an acid salt often occurs in making may- 
onnaise and other salad dressings. The addition of a small amount of acid 
to egg yolk will curdle it, but upon the addition of a little more acid the 
curd may dissolve. 

Stoichiometrical combination. Stoichiometrical combination means 
that the reaction between compounds is carried out according to the laws 
of valence. Loeb and others working with dilute solutions of proteins, 
acids, alkalies, and salts showed that proteins combine with acids and al- 
kalies in stoichiometrical relationship. But Hoffman and Gortner have 
shown that proteins in stronger concentrations of acids or alkalies adsorb 



SURFACE TENSION 13 

acid or alkali*. This means that owing to the surface area and the physical 
property of adsorption the proteins can combine with larger quantities of 
acids or alkalies than is possible in stoichiometrical combination alone. 

Boundary Phenomena 

Because of the size of micelles, surface phenomena assume an important 
place in colloidal reactions. Surface tension, the formation of foams, inter- 
facial tension, adsorption, formation of surface skins, orientation of mole- 
cules, cohesion, and adhesion all have application in food preparation. Dif- 
ferent authorities use a different terminology to designate the chemical and 
physico-chemical processes taking place at the interface between two phases. 
Kruyt calls them boundary phenomena, Freundlich designates them as 
capillary chemistry, and other authorities use other terms. 

Total surface area increases in proportion to the increase in number and 
decrease in size of the micelles. Molecular systems have proportionally a 
greater surface area than colloidal ones, but, on account of the small size 
of the particles, other forces have a greater effect than surface ones in 
molecular systems. 

Freundlich states that '*The subject of capillary chemistry may be divided 
into natural subdivisions, according to the nature of the interfaces which 
separate the various possible pairs of phases. We can distinguish the follow- 
ing interfaces: liquid/gaseous, liquid/liquid, solid/gaseous, solid/liquid, 
solid/solid. Because of the complete rigidity of the interface between two 
solids, the section relating to this pair drops out." 

Surface tension. Arbitrarily, surface tension refers to the tension 
of a liquid/gas interface. Liquids like gases possess kinetic energy, but un- 
like gases they have a surface or a boundary layer. This boundary layer 
gives a liquid certain properties that gases do not have. Surface tension is 
the result of the inherent property of a fluid to tend to form a minimum 
surface under all conditions. The minimum surface for a given volume is 
in the form of a sphere ; hence, when free to do so liquids assume a spheri- 
cal shape. Small drops of water falling on a dusty surface or a waxy leaf 
tend to form in drops. Large drops are flattened by gravity. When drops 
of water fall on a surface like clean glass, they spread and wetting occurs. 
The forces acting between the clean glass and the liquid prevent the liquid 
assuming a spherical shape. 

The molecules in the interior of a homogeneous liquid do not exhibit any 
surface-tension phenomena in relation to one another since they are sub- 
jected to a balanced attraction. That is, they are equally attracted by other 
molecules on all sides. But the surface film is in a state of tension due to 
the unbalanced attractions of the molecules at the surface. The molecules 
are attracted only downward and sideways. Whereas the molecules in the 
interior of the liquid are evidently arranged at random, those in the surface 
are oriented or arranged in a definite and orderly manner. Freundlich 



14 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

states that it is only a step to conceive that this tendency to form a mini- 
mum surface resides in a membrane. Kruyt speaks of a boundary layer. 
The tension of this membrane is the so-called surface tension of the liquid. 
Surface tension is defined by Buchanan and Fulmer as ''the amount of 
work required to produce a new surface of unit area at constant tempera- 
ture." To enlarge the surface of the liquid requires work. The amount of 
work expended to enlarge a surface multiplied by the area increased is 
termed free surface energy. The amount of work to enlarge a surface is 
greater with increased surface tension. Just as the surface area of a liquid 
tends to assume a minimum surface through its inherent surface tension, 
so free energy tends to assume a minimum value. The free surface energy 
is decreased (1) by reducing the surface area or (2) by reducing the sur- 
face tension. Hence, small drops of liquid will unite with large drops if 
they are within the same space so that they are connected by their vapor, 
thus reducing the surface area. 

Water has a high surface tension. Surface tension is measured in dynes 
per centimeter. The surface tension of water at 18°C. is 73.0; that of ethyl 
alcohol, methyl alcohol, and chloroform at 20°C. is 21.7, 23.0, and 26.7, 
respectively. The surface tension of mercury at 15°C. is 436.0. Surface ten- 
sion decreases with increase in temperature, becoming zero at the critical 
temperature. 

The surface tension of solutions. When a substance is dissolved 
in a pure liquid the surface tension of the solution may not be changed, 
it may be raised, or it may be lowered. The substances that scarcely change 
the surface tension or elevate it slightly include the aqueous solutions of 
most electrolytes and some organic compounds. Sugar increases the surface 
tension of water. Freundlich calls these substances capillary-inactive or 
surface-inactive. The group of substances that lower surface tension in- 
cludes in aqueous solutions many organic compounds such as aldehydes, 
fatty acids, fats, acetone, amines, alcohols, tannins, saponins, and proteins. 
Freundlich calls this group of substances capillary-active or surface-active. 
If a substance lowers or increases the surface tension, the effect is always 
increased with its concentration. Surface tension can be lowered tremen- 
dously, but it can be raised to only a slight extent. If a substance lowers 
the surface tension its concentration is greater in the boundary layer than 
in the bulk of the liquid ; and, conversely, if the substance raises the surface 
tension the concentration is less in the boundary layer. 

Substances like the fatty acids, formic, acetic, propionic, and butyric, 
etc., that belong to a homologous series, show an increased lowering of the 
surface tension as the series is ascended, if they are kept at the same con- 
centration. This regularity of increase with such a series is known as 
Traube's rule. 

Formation of foams. Absorption at liquid/gaseous interfaces. 
A foam is a dispersed gaseous phase, the dispersing medium often being a 
liquid. The solutions of substances that lower surface tension are apt to 



INTERFACIAL TENSION OF LIQUIDS/LIQUIDS 15 

froth. Freundllch states that the formation of a foam Is a complicated 
phenomenon. ''Whilst in most other colloidal structures the particles of the 
disperse phase are of colloidal minuteness, this is by no means essential 
or even usual, in the case of foams. On the other hand the dispersion 
medium is often of colloidal fineness, that is, the gas bubbles are separated 
from one another by liquid films, having a thickness of only a iew m/x. 
Hence in a foam the surface of a liquid has been enormously extended, 
which is in opposition to the tendency of surface tension to make the sur- 
face a minimum. For this reason a liquid must fulfil a number of special 
conditions. In the first place the surface tension of the liquid must be 
small, for otherwise its tendency to reduce the surface would be too power- 
ful." A second condition for the production of stable foams is that the 
vapor pressure shall be small, for substances with high vapor pressure 
evaporate rapidly. The surface films must not coalesce readily. These con- 
ditions are fulfilled by aqueous solutions of capillary-active substances, and 
especially by sols of many colloids, like soaps, saponins, tannins, and 
proteins. Freundlich states that in protein solutions a third influence plays 
a part, for they have the property of forming thin "pellicles" or surface 
skins on the boundary layer, which tend to prevent evaporation. Since 
the substance that lowers surface tension of the liquid is found in greater 
concentration in the foam, if the foam is continually removed as it is 
formed, the greater portion of the protein or other substance is removed. 
This is applied in the following and similar ways. In making sorghum 
molasses, in order to have a delicate-flavored product, one must have 
"a good boil" and remove the scum forming on the surface. In this way, 
tannins, which would increase the bitterness of the sorghum, proteins, and 
other substances are removed. 

Rahn has shown analytically the results of the application of "the law of 
Gibbs and Thomson which states that substances which cause a depression 
of surface tension will accumulate in the surface. In a gelatin solution, 
there is more gelatin in the very surface layer than in the center of the 
solution." In a milk foam the concentration of protein is greater in the 
foam than in the solution. The analytical results of Rahn are given in 
Table 2. 

Rahn states that "If protein is concentrated on the surface it has a 
tendency to become solid, but all proteins do not behave alike. Some 
solidify rapidly, others slowly, and some do not solidify at all. Quite often, 
this solidification is irreversible, and the protein, when put back into the 
solution, will not dissolve again." When milk foams, solid walls form 
around the air bubbles and, when the foam settles, these walls of protein 
can be seen with the aid of a microscope. 

Interfacial tension of liquids/liquids. When two non-miscible 
liquids are poured together, one liquid forms a layer on top of the other, 
thus making a liquid/liquid boundary. The less the solubility of the two 
liquids in each other, the greater their interfacial tension; but most liquids

are not completely insoluble in each other. Just as a substance may con- 
centrate at a liquid/gaseous interface, so likewise those substances which 
decrease interfacial tension tend to concentrate at a liquid/liquid or a 
liquid/solid interface. With the addition of a third substance soluble in 
water, Traube's rule holds, but if it is more soluble in the second liquid 
then the lowering of the interfacial tension is small and Traube's rule 
scarcely applies. 

Adsorption. Adsorption has been defined as the concentration of a 
substance at an interface. The increased concentration at the interface is 
designated as positive adsorption ; a decrease in the boundary layer is called 
negative adsorption. The amount adsorbed depends on the concentration 
of the material being adsorbed and the extent of the surface at which it 
can be adsorbed. The importance of surface reactions or phenomena can- 
not be over-emphasized in food preparation. Lowering of interfacial tension 
aids in the forming of emulsions. Fat is strongly adsorbed by sugar crystals, 
and when the two are mixed this aids in distributing the fat throughout 
the batter. 

Bancroft states that peptization is always due to adsorption. Since peptiza- 
tion occurs frequently in food preparation, additional mention should be 
made of it here in connection with adsorption. Bancroft states that theo- 
retically there are three possibilities when adsorption occurs at a surface. 
(1) If an adsorbed film has a low surface tension on the water side and a 
high one on the other side, it will tend to scrunch up and to peptize the solid 
as internal phase. (2) If the reverse is true, the solid will tend to form the 
external phase. (3) If the two surface tensions are equal, neither will pre- 



ORIENTATION OF MOLECULES 17 

vail. Many instances of peptization might be mentioned. There is the pre- 
vention of coagulation by heat of peptizating action of sugar on egg pro- 
tein. There is the peptizing action of soda on flour proteins with increasing 
tenderness of the product. This occurs in the chocolate cake known as 
devil's food when excess soda is used. 

The interfacial tension o£ solids/liquids. Adsorption is very pro- 
nounced at the interface between these two phases. Just as small drops of 
a liquid will unite through their vapor to form larger drops, thus reducing 
the free surface energy and their surface area, so small crystals in a super- 
saturated solution will unite to form larger crystals. Small crystals have a 
greater solubility than large crystals. They also have a greater surface area 
than the large ones per unit mass, thus a greater surface energy. Since 
surface energy tends to a minimum, equilibrium can be reached only by 
establishment of larger crystals in the solution. A discussion of the growth 
of crj'stals in fondant and similar candies during storage is given later. 

Formation of surface skins. Bechhold states that one characteristic 
of colloidal systems is the forming of a surface skin. This may be similar 
to the formation of a boundary layer in a liquid. Staining solutions form 
a scum on the surface that must be removed by straining before using. 
In food preparation this surface skin may be due to a change, as coagulation 
of a portion of the egg by beating or coagulation of proteins by heating. 
Whatever the cause, beaten eggs and egg yolks form surface skins after 
standing a short time, which is not entirely due to a drying of the surface. 
Boiled milk forms a pronounced skin during heating and after cooling. 

Orientation of molecules. The molecules at an interface do not 
lie at random but are oriented or arranged in a definite manner. The 
arrangement assumed depends partly upon the arrangement of the atoms 
in the molecule. Molecules of ethane (CH3.CH3), butane, and pentane 
are symmetrical, i.e., in each molecule the two ends are identical. In acetic 
acid (CH3.COOH) the two ends of the molecule are unsymmetrical. In 
ethane the two ends would behave the same at an interface, but this would 
not hold for acetic acid. The (CH3) group is called a non-polar group; 
the (COOH) group, a polar one. At the air/ water interface polar groups 
always orient away from the air and towards the water, for water has 
pronounced polar characteristics. "Like attracts like" is a rule that all 
students of organic chemistry have learned. In general, the polar liquids are 
miscible, but slightly polar liquids are relatively insoluble in polar liquids. 
A substance like acetic acid, containing a short hydrocarbon chain and a 
polar group, is completely miscible with water, for the (COOH) group is 
attracted to the water so strongly that the hydrocarbon chain is also 
dragged into the water. When two (CH3) groups are attached to the 
(COOH) group, the solubility is lessened, and with increasing length of 
the hydrocarbon chain solubility in water progressively decreases. Thus the 
possession of a polar group confers upon the substance a certain solubility 
in water, and the possession of a non-polar group may confer upon it a 



18 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

greater solubility in some other solvent. Orientation occurs at the interface 
of two liquids, such as emulsions. Polar groups are those containing oxygen, 
nitrogen, sulfur, or iodine. Thus substances containing (COOH), 
(CHO), or (NH2) groups, or double bonds, contain polar groups. Polar- 
ity is based upon the concept that some parts of a molecule may have 
gained w^hile other parts may have lost one or more electrons. This results 
in differences in charges at a small distance apart. The polar groups or 
polar substances are reactive; the non-polar groups or substances are more 
inert. 

Cohesion. Cohesion refers to the property of a substance whereby 
the particles of a body are united throughout the mass. The particles as a 
unit resist being torn apart. 

Adhesion. Adhesion refers to the attraction whereby the surface of 
a substance sticks to the adjacent surface of another substance. Drops of 
water adhere to glass, and the dough adheres to the sides of the container 
in which it is placed. Pans for sponge and angel cakes are not greased, so 
that the adhesion of the cake mixture to the sides of the pan will aid 
expansion of the cake. 

Coagulation of Proteins 

The term denaturation is used more frequently than coagulation by 
scientific investigators at the present time to denote certain changes in 
proteins. Definite characteristics of the proteins are changed when they 
are coagulated, among which is loss of solubility in water and dilute salt 
solutions. In some instances and under certain conditions the coagulation 
process may be reversible. 

Manner in which denaturation may be brought about. Coagula- 
tion of proteins may be brought about by a variety of processes. In cookery 
one of the principal means of coagulation is heat. But in addition to heat 
the action of acids, alkalies, salts, alcohol, mechanical agitation, radiation, 
and ultra-sonic vibrations may denature the protein and convert it from a 
soluble into an insoluble form. 

Some changes in the proteins during denaturation. All investi- 
gators agree that denaturation is brought about in two steps. The first step 
is a preliminary alteration of the protein or denaturation. The second is a 
physical change which leads to coagulation or aggregation. Clayton in 
discussing "Foods as Colloid Systems" reviews some of the theories of 
protein denaturation. ''Hydrolysis has been frequently reported as the 
cause of denaturation, but present views incline to the idea of some struc- 
tural rearrangement within the molecule. Thus, the refractive index in- 
creases during heat denaturation, whilst X-ray diffraction patterns lead 
to the view that coagulation is accompanied by the elimination of water 
between NHo and COOH groups. . . . Cubin holds that denaturation is 
the distortion or opening up of the protein unit, whilst flocculation is the 



HEAT COAGULATION 19 

process following this and rendered possible by it. Interaction of NH2 and 
COOH groups situated on contiguous colloid units leads to aggregation 
and, hence, coagulation." 

No matter how denaturation is brought about, the denatured product 
has sulfur atoms, the combination of which differs from those in the native 
protein. Mirsky and Anson have shown that in native egg albumin no 
sulfhydryl (SH) and disulfide (S-S) groups are detectable by certain 
methods. But in completely coagulated protein the number of SH and 
S-S groups detectable is the same as in hydrolyzed protein. These workers 
have also shown that in partially coagulated protein when the soluble and 
insoluble fractions are separated the soluble portion contains no detectable 
SH or S-S groups, but the insoluble fraction has the number of reactive 
SH and S-S groups characteristic of the completely denatured protein. 
In the interfacial coagulation of a protein, i.e., when a film of insoluble 
protein forms at the surface of a protein solution, SH and S-S groups 
appear, the number being the same as that found in the hydrolyzed protein. 
Also when the proteins are denatured by ultra-violet light, by acids, or by 
other means the SH and S-S groups appear. From these results they con- 
clude that the formation of insoluble proteins and increase in detectable 
SH and S-S groups are closely linked phenomena; that denaturation is a 
definite chemical reaction; and that a given protein molecule is either 
completely native or completely denaturated. 

In a later paper Mirsky and Anson report that the number of detectable 
SH and S-S groups in different proteins varies with the pH and the tem- 
perature. To illustrate, native hemoglobin had no detectable SH groups 
at pH 6.8. But with increase of pH the SH groups become detectable 
in increasing numbers up to pH 9.6. But native egg albumin showed no 
detectable group at pH 6.8 or pH 9.6. However, denatured hemoglobin 
had detectable groups at pH 6.8 and still more at pH 9.6. They found 
that intact, unhydrolyzed proteins possess in addition to SH groups other 
reducing groups which can be oxidized by ferricyanide. The number and 
activity of these groups vary from protein to protein. They are probably 
contained in the tyrosine and tryptophane component of proteins. "It can 
now be seen that the activation of SH and S-S groups in protein denatura- 
tion is part of a more general process." 

Heat coagulation. As has been indicated heat coagulation of proteins 
is used in preparation of food products, and, fortunately for the mental 
equilibrium of the cook, heat coagulation of proteins is ordinarily not 
reversible. Otherwise, many cooked dishes would, with certain treatment, 
revert to their original uncooked consistency. 

Some of the changes occurring during heat coagulation of the proteins 
have been indicated. But these are not the only factors playing a role in 
the process. Electrolytes have some role in heat coagulation of proteins. 
This is shown in the work with distilled water egg custards. It has been 
shown that, if the mineral content of egg white is lowered through dialysis, 



20 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

coagulation does not occur on heating. The effect of electrolytes in heat 
coagulation may be brought about either by chemical reaction or by 
adsorption. If the effect of salts is brought about by adsorption, the salts 
must be very strongly adsorbed and almost impossible to remove from the 
aggregated protein by washing the protein, for the process is usually 
irreversible. Any theory of heat coagulation of the proteins must not only 
explain how the proteins are rendered insoluble by heat but the effect of 
other factors. That the heat coagulation of proteins is influenced by 
electrolytes, sugar, temperature, time, the reaction of the solution, and the 
presence of water and other factors is evident when the cooking of eggs, 
custards, salad dressings, cheese and egg dishes, baked products, and meat 
is observed. The effect of some of these factors can be determined in the 
laboratory; but the understanding of the manner of their action is lacking 
in many instances and awaits explanation by the colloid chemist or bio- 
chemist. 

Bancroft and Rutzler have reported that heat-coagulated egg white 
may be peptized by dextrose and certain salts. They showed that the 
coagulated and repeptized egg-white sols are identical with the original 
solution by immuno-biological tests for species specificity and isoelectric 
point measurements. Because of the similarity of the reversed protein to 
the original protein they believe that coagulation is a colloidal reaction 
which is due to a physical rather than a chemical change. 

Interfacial denaturation. Proteins are also denatured at interfaces, 
typical examples being the insoluble portion of beaten egg white, and froth 
or foam on milk. When egg white or milk foams are allowed to remain 
undisturbed, they gradually collapse and the wrinkled membranes, skin, 
or films may be observed through the microscope. Mention has already 
been made that protein can be recovered from a solution by removing the 
foam. Denaturation of protein solution occurs by shaking and in some 
instances spontaneously, an example being the membrane formed at the 
interface of an air/protein solution when no agitation has occurred. 

Neurath and Bull state that both heat and surface denaturation proc- 
esses involve an unfolding of the peptide chains which in the natural state 
are curled up in the interior of the molecule and become stretched out 
when the molecule comes in contact with the surface of the bulk of the 
solution. The polar groups of the protein molecule, the amino, carboxyl, 
the OH groups of the hydroxy acids, the sulfur-containing groups, and 
the peptide linkages, have an affinity for water; whereas the non-polar or 
lyophobic groups, the hydrocarbon residues, tend to be repelled by water. 
Thinking that an interaction between the amino and carboxjd groups 
during heat denaturation might diminish the lyophobic or polar properties 
of natural protein, whereas an unfolding of the peptide chains by surface 
denaturation might expose lyophobic groups to the surface, which in the 
native state are buried in the interior, Neurath and Bull measured the 
volume contraction of native, heat-denatured, and surface-denatured pro- 



PEPTIZATION OF PROTEINS 21 

tei'ns. They found that the native protein had the lowest density, heat- 
denatured ones were intermediate, and the surface-denatured protein had 
the highest density. 

This membrane-forming property of protein through denaturation is 
important in food preparation, in all products in which beaten egg white 
is used, in emulsions, and wherever interfacial reactions occur. — — ^_ 

Membranes form readily on the surface of protoplasm and play Impor- 
tant parts in cell functions. The presence of calcium has been shown to 
stiffen the surface membranes in some instances, whereas sodium and 
potassium in the absence of calcium tend to soften and dissolve the membrane. 

This suggests that salts may also have some influence in surface denatura- 
tion and that the salts of flour, egg, and milk used in cooked products may 
modify the denaturation at surfaces. 

Clayton states that high concentrations of sugar in egg white will pre- 
vent surface denaturation, which of course has application in making angel 
cakes, meringues, and sweetened souffles. 

Peptization of Proteins 

Peptization is the reverse process of coagulation. It increases dispersion 
and solubility. 

Means of bringing about peptization. Peptization may be brought 
about by chemical, electrical, and mechanical means or by enzymes. Freund- 
lich states that the hydroxyl ion is generally a very effective peptizer. Other 
peptizing ions used in food preparation are the citrate, acetate, and tartrate 
ions. Peptization brought about by adsorption has been mentioned. 

Peptization of proteins. The results of Gortner, Hoffman, and Sin- 
clair show that different salts added to wheat proteins in varying amounts 
to give the same pH, or in equivalent concentrations, cause peptization 
and solution of varying amounts of the proteins. Both cations and anions 
form a lyotropic series. They found the anions arranged in the following 
order of increasing peptization : F < SO4 < Ql < tartrate < Br < I ; and 
for the cations the following order of increasing peptization : Na < K < 
Li < Ba < Sr < Mg < Ca. Most of their salt solution extracts of flour 
had a />H of 5.0 to 6.0. This would be on the acid side of the isoelectric 
point of the flour proteins, and they would be positively charged. When 
the solubility of wheat proteins is increased, the tenderness of the result- 
ing bread is increased. 

Freundlich states that hydrophobic colloids and also solids may be 
peptized by suitable electrolytes, but the process does not take place spon- 
taneously. It is necessary to divide up mechanically the liquid or solid mass 
very finely, in order that the charging action of the peptizing ion may be 
effective. In some liquids it is often suflScient to divide them by energetic 
stirring. 

"Salting-out" of hydrophilic colloids occurs at high concentrations. But 



22 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

at lower concentrations electrolytes frequently bring about peptization. 
Freundlich states that this has been investigated particularly in some pro- 
teins or mixtures of proteins, it being found clearly in the case of globulins. 
Some globulins remain in solution only in the range of their isoelectric 
point because of the peptizing effect of electrolytes. 

Both the concentration of the electrolyte and its valence affect the extent 
of peptization. In general, the peptizing action is increased with increasing 
valence. For example, there is little peptization with the chlorine ion, the 
sulfate ion peptizes in higher concentrations, and the citrate ion brings 
about peptization with low concentrations. 

Bound and Free Water 

Water plays a very important role in both plant and animal life as a 
solvent for sugars, electrolytes, etc., and thus in the translocation of food 
material and metabolism products. But in addition to being a solvent 
water forms part of the inmost structural portion of the cell. For example, 
from muscle tissue, although it is composed of more than 65 per cent of 
water, even with considerable pressure only a few drops of liquid can be 
pressed. Part of this water is free water, for it contains the dissolved salts, 
proteins, and other materials. But as the period after death increases, 
changes occur in the tissue, and greater amounts of liquid can be obtained 
with pressure. This water, held by the colloidal micelles so that it forms an 
intimate part of the material, is designated as bound water. 

Not only cells of plants and animal tissues, but starches, proteins of flour, 
gelatin, eggs, and other complex compounds such as lecithin have the 
capacity to bind water, giving the product certain characteristics. The 
free water is designated as that portion of the water in which solutes such 
as sucrose and salt can be dissolved. The bound water is that portion 
which is held so tightly that not even sucrose will dissolve in it. The 
density of bound water is so great that some investigators state it is 
equivalent to having a press.ure of 10 thousand atmospheres on it. From 
this and other properties bound water is often considered as solid water. 
Bound water has a very low dielectric constant. Burns states, ''All the 
physiological colloids have the property of taking in relatively large quan- 
tities of water even against enormous pressures, and of holding this water 
against even strenuous methods of removal. This 'bound' water stored in 
the micropores is under considerable compression, so much so that its 
density and all its physical properties are altered." 

The compression of the bound water in bulk is probably due to orienta- 
tion and packing of the water molecules around the micelles. It has no 
appreciable vapor pressure and freezes with difficulty or forms such small 
ice crystals that the biological structure is not injured. 

Bound water often requires the application of heat and suction to drive 
it off. Burns says, "An alumina gel cannot be dried by heating it for 2 or 3 



FLUIDITY AND VISCOSITY 23 

days at 500°C., yet some relationship does exist between the 'free' and 
'bound' water. Under certain conditions as yet undefined, bound water 
may become free again, and the reverse." The greater power of some 
samples of meat to retain moisture and yet appear firm and less juicy than 
other samples cooked under the same conditions is known. Ostwald states 
that pork can be distinguished from other meats by the fact that its water- 
holding capacity suffers the least change when cooked or dried. In his work 
with angel cake Barmore speaks of the crumb of cake baked at higher oven 
temperatures as containing as much moisture but apparently binding the 
water more securely for it appears more dry. 

Fluidity, Viscosity, and Plasticity of Colloidal Systems 

Fluidity and viscosity. Bingham uses the term fluidity to express 
the opposite of viscosit)^ A fluid like water yields readily to any force that 
tends to change its form, whereas a viscous substance shows some resistance 
to flow. Viscosity is one of the important properties of colloidal systems. 
As a general rule, the lyophobic colloids show a viscosity but little greater 
than that of the dispersion medium, the viscosity increasing only slightly 
with increasing concentration of the micelles. But the lyophilic colloids may 
show very high viscosities or even plasticity with very low concentrations 
of the micelles. 

Bingham states that "a mixture of liquids may have an indefinite number 
of fluidities dependent upon the method of mixing, in other words, upon 
the structure of the liquid." He also states that colloidal solutions show 
differences in fluidity due to differences in structure. Thus it is possible that 
cake or other batters made with the same materials and the same propor- 
tion of materials may show differences in the structure of the finished cake 
on account of different methods of mixing, giving different viscosities to 
the batter. 

Some substances flow readily; others resist flow; and some must have 
weight applied to start flow. When a substance tends to resist a shearing 
force it may exhibit a flow that is characterized as viscous, turbulent, or 
plastic. If the substance entirely regains its original shape, when the shear- 
ing stress is removed, it shows perfect elasticity. If the original shape is 
not entirely regained and the substance is deformed to an extent directly 
proportional to the shearing force, then the substance is said to show 
viscosity. This flow that is directly proportional to the shearing force is 
called linear flow. By this is meant that if a weight of 1 pound produces 
a definite deformation, a weight of 2 pounds produces twice that deforma- 
tion. Turbulent flow is the flow obtained when the ratio of the shearing 
force to the deformation decreases. 

A pure liquid at a given temperature and pressure has a definite fluidity. 
The viscosity of water is approximately six times as great at 0° as at 
100°C. The viscosity of sols usually decreases with an increase in tem- 



24 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

perature, part of this being due to the effect of temperature upon the 
intermicellar liquid. Gortner states that in "colloid systems changes due 
to temperature are influenced not only by the viscosity of the dispersion 
medium but likewise by the effect of temperature on solvation." Thus 
gelatin and agar-agar form sols with rather low viscosity at high tempera- 
tures when compared to the viscous liquid or plastic gels they form at low 
temperatures. Starch usually forms a suspension at low temperatures, and 
its decided increase in viscosity or plasticity comes with rapid hydration at 
the gelatinization point. Gortner states that heating a starch paste beyond 
the gelatinization temperature causes a decrease in viscosity or plasticity. 
Electrolytes added to lyophilic systems, often even in traces, cause great 
changes in the viscosity of the sol. 

The factors affecting the viscosity of lyophilic systems. Gort- 
ner adds an eleventh factor, that of rate of shear, pointed out by Sharp 
and Gortner, to the ten given by Ostwald that cause variation in the 
viscosity of lyophilic systems. They are as follows: (1) concentration, 
(2) temperature, (3) degree of dispersion, (4) solvation, (5) electrical 
charge, (6) previous thermal treatment, (7) previous mechanical treat- 
ment, (8) the presence or absence of other lyophilic colloids, (9) the age 
of the lyophilic sol, (10) the presence of both electrolytes and non-elec- 
trolytes, and (11) the rate of shear. 

Viscosity is closely related to the consistency of the finished product in 
food preparation. So close is this relation in many cases that the ten factors 
listed by Ostwald may nearly be taken as ten commandments of food 
preparation. Thus the consistency of a custard is influenced by the concen- 
tration of egg or the protein micelles; the temperature to which it is 
cooked ; the degree of dispersion of the micelles, which is influenced by the 
reaction and other factors; the degree of hydration, which is influenced by 
reaction, the kind and concentration of salts present, etc. ; the beating 
of the egg; the use of milk or w^ater; how long the custard has aged in 
addition to the age of the eggs and milk when used ; the kinds and con- 
centration of salts in the egg and milk as well as the addition of sodium 
chloride and the non-electrolyte sugar. 

Since the line of demarcation between sols and gels is not a definite one, 
fruit jellies, gelatin, milk, cream, as well as egg dishes, may be added to 
the group of foods in which the consistency of the finished product is related 
to viscosity. But this does not end the application, for the structure or type 
of product in baked goods is closely related to the viscosity of the batter or 
dough, which in turn is influenced by all these factors. Of course these 
factors or nearly the same ones affect other properties as well as viscosity of 
food materials. Thus the extensibility of gluten, the heat coagulation of 
proteins, etc., are influenced by many or all of these factors. 

Plasticity. Bingham defines plasticity as "a property of solids in virtue 
of which they hold their shape permanently under the action of small 
shearing stresses but they are readily deformed, worked or molded, under 



ENERGETICS 25 

somewhat larger stresses. Plasticity is thus a complex property, made up 
of two independent factors, which we must evaluate separately." Modeling 
clay is plastic. Plasticity is an important property of fats used for cakes, 
biscuits, and pastry. A plastic fat has a consistency such that it will form 
a thin sheet or layer in a batter or it will retain air bubbles when 
''creamed." The enclosing of these air bubbles in the fat is an aid in leaven- 
ing cakes and may assist in obtaining a velvety texture, for the enclosing 
of the air renders the fat more plastic, thus more easily distributed in the 
batter at lower temperatures. 

Energetics 

Burns states, "Energy is the underlying cause of all changes in matter. 
This does not seem a very satisfactory definition, but, so far, it is the only 
one possible. . . . Energy, then, is that which produces an effect on our 
senses." It is measured by its power to do work. 

Energy in some form is often applied to the materials used for food 
products. This energy may be electrical, mechanical, or in the form of heat. 

An electric current passed through a food may be used to cook it. Very 
interesting experiments are being carried out along this line of work by the 
Household Equipment Department at Iowa State College. One of the 
striking results is the very short time required to cook the food. The pas- 
sage of an electric current is used by some companies to pasteurize milk 
and by some to sterilize fruit juices. 

Mechanical energy is used to beat, stir, fold, knead, or grind food. 

The frequency of application of heat to foods does not need to be men- 
tioned, for this is what the term to cook means. Foods may be cooked by 
radiant heat; or by transmission of the heat by conduction, i.e., from parti- 
cle to particle ; or by convection, which is the diffusion of heat through a gas 
or liquid by movement of the gas or liquid particles. A combination of these 
methods may be used to transmit the heat. Oven cooking employs all three. 

Kinetic energy is due to motion. It may be due to motion of the sub- 
stance itself or of the particles composing it. It is directly available for 
work. Potential energy is associated with position, i.e., composition, stress, 
or strain. Kinetic energy is necessary to liberate it to perform work. 

Just as matter is indestructible, though its form may be changed, so is 
energy indestructible. This constitutes the first law of thermodynamics. 
The law of Hess states that the amount of heat generated by a chemical 
reaction is the same whether it takes place all at once or in steps. 

The second law of thermodynamics concerns the degradation or dissipa- 
tion of energy. In practise, some of the freed energy is converted into heat, 
which is diffused among the surrounding objects, and, so far as work is 
concerned, is lost. Burns states the law simply: "Every change takes place 
at the cost of a certain amount of available energy." He adds that the 
second law lends itself to the deduction that the cause of all change is the 



26 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

tendency of energy to attain the same uniform degree of intensity as that 
of its environment. This means that any system tends to change to the 
most stable state. 

Bread during baking tends to attain a physico-chemical equilibrium. But 
the temperature attained during baking is much higher than the storage 
temperature. Freshly baked bread does not taste or feel like bread 24 hours 
old. Bread can be stored so that it loses no moisture, yet readjustments in 
the loaf take place, so that staling occurs. If bread is stored at temperatures 
of 60°C. or above, the texture remains more like that of freshly baked 
bread and staling is not perceptible. But at this temperature bacterial 
changes occur readily. If the bread has not lost considerable moisture, upon 
reheating it, it acquires the characteristics of freshly baked bread. 

The principle of Le Chatelier gives the factors of equilibrium: ''Every 
system in chemical equilibrium, under the influence of a change of any 
single one of the factors of equilibrium, undergoes a transformation in 
such direction that, if this transformation took place alone, it vv^ould pro- 
duce a change in the opposite direction of the factor in question. The 
factors of equilibrium are temperature, pressure and electromotive force, 
corresponding to three forms of energy; heat, electricity and mechanical 
energy." 

Hydrogen-Ion Concentration 

The symbol pH is very commonly used in present-day literature. Some 
explanation of the term and its relation to hydrogen-ion concentration is 
desirable. Perhaps it w^ill be best to review briefly what is meant by hydro- 
gen-ion concentration. In a solution of hydrochloric acid in water, the 
molecule of the acid consists of an atom of hydrogen united to an atom of 
chlorine. Hydrochloric acid molecules are found in the solution, but not all 
the acid remains in the molecular form. Part of the acid molecules are 
ionized into hydrogen ions and chlorine ions, the degree of ionization de- 
pending upon the concentration, the more dilute the acid solution the 
greater the percentage of hydrochloric acid ionized. The hydrogen ions are 
positively charged, and the chlorine ions are negatively charged. In symbols, 
the ionization of hydrochloric acid is expressed as follows: 

HCl 1==; H+ + Cl- 

When a substance is ionized in solution the solution conducts an elec- 
trical current. 

When water is ionized it gives both hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions. 
Since the ionization of water is very slight, the amount of hydrogen and 
hydroxyl ions in a liter of water is not great. 

H2O tzzzz; H+ + OH- 
In pure water the concentration of hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions is 



HYDROGEN-ION CONCENTRATION 27 

equal at 22°C. The reaction of water varies at various temperatures, so 
that the following discussion is confined to room temperature or 22 °C. The 

concentration of the hydrogen ions and hydroxyl ions is of a 

10,000,000 

gram-molecular weight (mole) each per liter. A normal solution of hydro- 
gen ions contains 1 gram-molecular weight (1 gram) of hydrogen ions per 
liter of solution; a normal solution of hydroxyl ions contains 1 gram- 
molecular weight (17 grams) of hydroxyl ions per liter of solution. A liter 

of pure water contains of a mole of hydrogen. This requires 

10,000,000 

many figures to express as a fraction, so for convenience the concentration 

is expressed as follows : ^^ = 10"'^. Again for convenience Sorensen 

proposed to disregard the minus sign and use the numerical value of the 
exponent 10 to express the reaction corresponding to the concentration of 
hydrogen ions. 

When the concentration of the hydroxyl ions is equal to that of the 

hydrogen ions, the concentration of hydroxyl ions is also of a 

10,000,000 

mole or 10~^. This is the neutral point. The term pH is used to denote the 
concentration of the hydrogen ions only. Sometimes />OH is used to denote 
the concentration of the hydroxyl ions. Thus when the concentration of the 
hydrogen ions is pH 7, that of the hydroxyl ions is pOH 7. If the con- 
centration of the hydroxyl ions is multiplied by the concentration of the 
hydrogen ions a definite product is obtained. In fractions this would be 
written thus : 



X 



10,000,000 10,000,000 100,000,000,000,000 

But in the exponential notation it is expressed as follows: 

10-7 X 10-7 = 10-1^ 

When the hydrogen-ion concentration in a solution is increased, the hy- 
droxyl-ion concentration is decreased, so that the product of the concentra- 
tion of the hydrogen and hydroxyl ions always gives 10~^^, and this is a 
constant for the product of these two ions. Thus in a solution that has a 
pH 6 the hydrogen ions exceed the hydroxyl ions but the product of their 
concentrations is the constant 10^^^. In a solution that has a pH 6 the 

concentration of the hydrogen ions expressed in fractions is ^^ of 

1,000,000 

a mole of hydrogen. In the same solution the concentration of the hy- 
droxyl ions is ^ of a mole. The product of these two concentra- 

^ 100,000,000 



28 RELATION OF COOKERY TO COLLOID CHEMISTRY 

tions gives the constant. Expressed in exponential notation it is 10"^ X 
10"^ = 10"^"*. In a solution that has a pH 8 the hydroxyl ions exceed the 
hydrogen ions but the product of their concentration is again 10"^^. When 
the concentration of the hydrogen ions is pH 3 or 10~^ then the concentra- 
tion of the hydroxyl ions is 10"^^ and their product is again 10^^^. 

Literally, the term pH means to a power. It is used to express the re- 
action of a fluid, that is, its degree of acidity or alkalinity, but it does not 
do this directl)^, as is shown in the above equations. It is an inverse logarith- 
mic function, deprived of its minus sign. Experimentally it is determined 
electrometrically and is really a number obtained from determining the 
electromotive force (E.M.F. ) of a substance in a suitable apparatus and 
by using this value of (E.M.F.) in a formula, computing the pH. 

Hydrogen-ion concentration refers to the concentration of the ionized or 
active ions per liter of substance. The pH value does not represent this 
directly but for all practical purposes may be taken as a value represent- 
ing it. 

The relation of hydrogen-ion concentration and />H values in solutions 
of varying normalities is given below.

The above arrangement shows that the pH value is not an arithmetical 
series or ratio but varies according to the logarithmic notation. Thus />H 2 
is not one-half of pH 1 but one-tenth of it. 

The number of times the hydrogen-ion and hydroxyl-ion concentrations 
of a solution exceed that of pure water may be shown as follows. The 
arrangement is by Alexander. 

The pH values are determined by two methods: the principal one is by 
electrometric determinations, the other is by the use of indicators. The 
latter is a rapid and a very useful way to determine an approximate pH 
value and to check apparatus. For an accurate determination the electro- 
metric method must be used.

CHAPTER II 

SUGAR COOKERY 

Classification of the Carbohydrates 

The carbohydrates are divided into three groups: the monosaccharids, 
disaccharids, and polysaccharids. The monosaccharids are composed of one 
saccharid or sugar group. They are sometimes called simple sugars. The 
monosaccharids difiEer from each other in the number of carbon groups 
and in the molecular arrangement. The monosaccharids contain alcohol 
groups (HCOH), the number of which may vary from one to six. 
In addition to the alcohol group a monosaccharid contains either an 
aldehyde (HC = O) or a ketone (C = O) group. Thus they are aldehyde 
or ketone derivatives of complex alcohols and as such are called aldoses or 
ketoses. 

A biose is a sugar w^ith two carbon groups, an alcohol group being at- 
tached to one carbon and an aldehyde group to the other. A triose has 
three carbon groups and has alcohol groups attached to two carbons and 
either an aldehyde or ketone to the third carbon. The common monosac- 
charids in foods are the hexoses, which contain six carbon groups. Five 
of the carbons have alcohol groups, but the sixth has an aldehyde or ketone. 
The common hexoses are dextrose and levulose, the former being an aldose, 
and the latter a ketose. The following formulas though not conveying the 
exact arrangement of the molecule illustrate the above points.

All sugars higher than tetroses may assume two structural forms, the 
pyran and the furan. The pyran form for a hexose sugar is a ring composed 
of five carbons and one oxygen with one carbon outside the ring; the furan

Beta-fructofuranose 



The two structural forms of the sugars are represented by the terms 
glucopyranose and glucofuranose for glucose, fructopyranose and fructo- 
furanose for fructose, etc. To avoid confusion of nomenclature, prefixes 
are added to the terms indicating structural form to differentiate the 
stereochemical forms (the same chemical and basic structural form but 
with different spacial arrangements of the hydrogen and h^'droxyl groups). 
Thus the prefixes alpha-, beta-, gamma-, etc., added to the name of the 
sugar with the ending denoting the structural form, such as alpha-gluco- 
pyranose, beta-glucofuranose, definitely identify each sugar. 

Haworth and his coworkers at Birmingham have worked out in detail 
the way in which sugar units are united into chains. Haworth states that 
there are several ways in w^hich two glucose units may be joined through 
the intermediary of a common oxygen atom. But of the several OH posi- 
tions available for providing the union of two glucose units, it has been 
found that the union is formed through the first carbon of one unit and 
the fourth carbon of the other glucose unit. Maltose is formed, as shown, 
by the union of two alpha-glucopyranose units. The union of about 30 
alpha-glucopyranose units in this manner, according to Haworth forms 
starch, though all investigators do not agree on the number of glucose 
units in the starch chain. (See discussion of starch in Chapter XL) 

Cellulose is composed of many beta-cellobiose units. In a manner similar 
to that in which maltose is formed, two beta-glucopyranose units form

through the first carbon to beta-fructopyranose. 

The disaccharids contain two monosaccharid sugar groups; the poly- 
saccharids contain many sugar groups. There are also trisaccharids. There 
is always the possibility that the trisaccharids and some of the other rare 
sugars may become commercially important, but at the present time they 
are little used except in scientific w^ork. 

The common disaccharids found in foods are sucrose, maltose, and lac- 
tose. Sucrose is composed of one dextrose and one levulose group; maltose 
is made up of two dextrose groups ; and lactose is composed of one dextrose 
and one galactose group. 

Following is a list of the common carbohydrates used in foods. For a 
complete list a physiological or organic chemistry may be consulted.

34 SUGAR COOKERY 



Sources o£ the Common Sugars 

Dextrose or glucose, for it is known by both names, is widely distributed 
in fruits, honey, and some vegetables. The sugar known by the trade name 
"Cerelose" is practically a pure crystalline dextrose and is made from corn. 
The term dextrose or glucose should be applied to crystalline dextrose 
or its solution. Commercial corn sirup has been incorrectly called glucose. 
It is made from corn, the starch being hydrolyzed with acid. Hydrolysis 
is carried to the point at which 40 to 50 per cent of the starch is changed 
to sugar, the remainder being split into dextrins. The sirup contains both 
dextrose and maltose, but for convenience the sugar is usually all deter- 
mined and expressed as dextrose. Thus corn sirup is a mixture of dextrin, 
maltose, dextrose, and water. 

Levulose or fructose is also widely distributed in natural foods, often 
accompanying dextrose, or dextrose and sucrose. At present, pure crystalline 
levulose is expensive. Honey contains nearly equal parts of dextrose and 
levulose. When honey crystallizes, the greater part of the levulose is in 
the sirup and the dextrose in the crystals. 

Sucrose is widely distributed in plants, often with dextrose and levulose. 
The common sources of it commercially are the sugar beet, the sugar cane, 
the sugar maple, and the sugar palm. It is the common granulated sugar 
on the market and is practically pure whether obtained from the beet or 
cane. Maple sugar is not purified, for it would then lose the flavor for 
which we prize it. 

Maltose is formed as an intermediate product when starch is hydrolyzed 
by boiling with mineral acid in the manufacture of commercial corn sirup 
from corn. Commercially it is prepared from starch by a diastatic enzyme 
and it is also found in germinating cereals and malt products. 

Lactose is obtained from milk. One of its uses is for infant feeding. 

Relative Sweetness of the Sugars 

Sweetness is a quality that is detected by taste, but there is no exact 
test for it. Much depends upon how the test is conducted, whether the 
tongue is dry or moist, upon what part of the tongue the sample is placed, 
and with several other conditions, the fatigue of the sense of taste. Some 
persons detect sweetness in less concentrations than others. It cannot be 
expected that all people will agree in their estimates of the relative sweet- 
ness of the sugars, even with carefully worked out tests. 

In rating the sweetness of the various sugars it is a commonly accepted 
practise to rate sucrose as 100. Sugars sweeter than sucrose are ranked 
higher than 100, and those less sweet are ranked lower. 

Biester and Wood of the University of Minnesota give the following 
rating to sugars : 



EFFECT OF ACID UPON SUGARS 35 

Levulose 173.3 

Sucrose 100.0 

Dextrose 74 . 3 

Maltose 32.5 

Lactose 16.0 

Sale and Skinner of the Bureau of Chemistry (Water and Beverage 
Laboratory) rate the sugars as follows: 

Sucrose 100 

Dextrose 50 

Levulose 150 

Maltose 50 

Invert sugar 85 

Paul in comparing the sweetness of several sugars with sucrose gives 
the following value : 

Sucrose 100 

Dextrose 52 

Levulose 103 

Lactose 28 

A commonly accepted value of dextrose at the present time is about 
70 to 75. There is the probability that this is too high and that 50 is a 
better figure. Levulose is conceded by all to be sweeter than sucrose, but 
again there is no agreement as to how much sweeter. Some authorities rank 
it 120 to 125. With the higher figures for the sweetening powers of dex- 
trose and levulose it would seem that invert sugar should be sweeter than 
the original sucrose. But the manufacturers of carbonated beverages, to 
whom this would be beneficial, since they use solutions of sirup, do not 
think that invert sugar is any sweeter than sucrose, even though 342 units 
of sucrose yield 360 units of invert sugar or a gain of 5 per cent in weight. 

Effect of Acid upon Sugars and Hydrolysis of Sugars 

Strong concentrated acids decompose all the sugars producing humus or 
caramel substances. The weak acids, malic and citric in fruits, lactic in sour 
milk, acetic acid, and salts with an acid reaction like cream of tartar, affect, 
the sugars in different degrees, depending on the particular acid used, the 
strength of the acid, whether it is heated, and the length of time of heating. 

The monosaccharids, dextrose and levulose, are not affected to any ap- 
preciable extent by weak acids. When sucrose is cooked with weak acids 
it is partially hydrolyzed to dextrose and levulose, but since the invert 
sugars are not affected by the acid practically no other change takes place. 

Lactose is only very slowly hydrolyzed by acid to dextrose and galactose. 

Maltose is less readily affected by acid than sucrose, but is slowly hy- 
drolyzed to two molecules of dextrose. 

Sucrose and fondant. Sucrose is very easily hydrolyzed, even by very 



36 SUGAR COOKERY 

weak acids, tlioui^h the addition of water to the sugar molecule cannot 
be brought about by mixing sugar and water, but may be brought about 
by enzymes as well as acids. The weak acids used in cookery — lemon juice, 
vinegar, fruit juices, or the acid salt cream of tartar — all cause sucrose to 
combine with water forming dextrose and levulose. Hydrolysis takes place 
more rapidly if the solution is heated. In making fondant with cream of 
tartar, if the sirup is boiled slowly for a long time, more inversion may 
take place than when the sirup is boiled quickly with a larger amount of 
cream of tartar. Compare the length of time required to bring about 
crystallization in Experiments 7C, 1, and 7C, 2. Hydrolysis of fondant 
containing cream of tartar occurs during storage though the rate is slow 
at the storage temperature. Fondant made with cream of tartar and stored 
in a fairly tight container becomes softer than fondant of the same con- 
sistency before storage, but without the addition of cream of tartar. The 
amount of the acid salt to bring about this softening at room tempera- 
ture imparts a slightly sour taste to the fondant. To many persons this 
slight acidity improves the flavor. In fondant made with a larger amount of 
cream of tartar (Experiment 7C, 4), considerable hydrolysis may occur 
with short storage. 

To determine the effect of salts found in hard water upon the decom- 
position of dextrose in fondant, some fondants were made with 10 per 
cent of dextrose added to sucrose and distilled water. To the solution 
different salts similar to those found in water were added, the fondants 
made and stored in a heavy glass container, with a tight-fitting lid. They 
were kept for two years. Acid calcium phosphate was added to some of the 
fondant to compare an acid-reacting salt containing calcium with the other 
calcium salts used. At the end of one year the fondants made with calcium 
acid phosphate were plastic and kneadable, whereas those made with mag- 
nesium sulfate, calcium sulfate, and other salts, as well as the control with 
no salt, were too hard and dry to be kneaded. Here slow hydrolysis from 
the calcium acid phosphate probably occurred over a long period, but drying 
out of the fondant was also prevented, which was due to the hygroscopic 
property of the levulose. If fondant is to be stored for some time before 
it is molded the fondant made with an acid salt remains soft and plastic, or 
Keeps better than fondant made without an acid or acid salt. 

Hydrolysis of sucrose is often spoken of as inversion and the resulting 
sugar as invert sugar. The reason for this name is found in the effect of 
invert sugar upon a beam of light. If a straight beam of light is allowed 
to pass through a solution of sucrose in an instrument called a polariscope, 
the beam of light is rotated to the right and the sucrose is called dextro- 
rotary. After the sucrose is hydrolyzed, the ray of light is rotated to the 
left and the invert sugar is levo-rotary. Because of this inversion of a beam 
of light, hydrolyzed sucrose is called invert sugar. Dextrose is dextro- 
rotary and sucrose is levo-rotary. It is due to the fact that levulose rotates 



EFFECT OF ALKALIES UPON SUGARS 37 

the beam of light further to the left than dextrose rotates it to the right 
that the rotation of invert sugar is opposite to that of sucrose. 

Hydrolysis o£ sugars by enzymes. Enzymes also bring about hy- 
drolysis of the disaccharid sugars. Since heat destroys enzymes the reaction 
must occur at a low temperature. The enzyme invertase causes hydrolysis 
of sucrose to dextrose and levulose. Maltose is prepared from corn by using 
an enzyme. 

Hydrolysis in chocolate creams. Jordan states that the liquefied 
centers of chocolate creams and other confections are brought about by 
acids, acid salts, or enzymes. The substance bringing about the hydrolysis is 
added when the fondant is fairly hard and the softening due to the hydrol- 
ysis occurs during storage. Paine states that the amount of the acid or acid 
salt required to bring about inversion imparts a perceptible acid taste to 
the fondant. Evaporation of liquid from the fondant must be prevented, 
or the fondant loses water and becomes dry. Then some moisture is neces- 
sary for hydrolysis to occur. The enzyme, invertase, may be added when 
the fondant is beaten or when it is molded before dipping. The proper 
amount of invertase is added for the inversion of the fondant, and accord- 
ing to Paine this inversion takes place more readily at pH 4.4 to 4.6. To 
give this acidity citric acid is added in small quantities. Invertase may be 
used in fondant for chocolate creams, in confections with fruit like cherries 
and pineapple, and in bonbons. The fat of chocolate prevents the confec- 
tions dipped in it from losing moisture by evaporation. The bonbons dry 
out more rapidly than the chocolate-covered candies. Paine states that the 
addition of a small amount of egg albumen or egg white lessens evaporation 
from the fondant. 

Hydrolysis of starch. Starch, like sucrose, is very readily hydrolyzed 
by acids, and the reaction takes place more rapidly at a high temperature. 
When starch is used with acid fruit juices, a larger proportion of starch is 
required to thicken the mixture to a definite consistency than is needed for 
an equal quantity of water or milk. Fillings for lemon or cherry pie, because 
of the hydrolysis by acid during cooking, need a larger proportion of starch 
for thickening than fillings like chocolate cream. 

Effect of Alkalies Upon Sugars 

Strong alkalies, like strong acids, decompose the sugars. Weak alkalies 
or salts with alkaline reaction, like sodium bicarbonate, common baking 
soda, also act upon the sugars. Even alkaline salts found in hard water 
may produce considerable decomposition in some of the sugars. Of the 
disaccharids those most easily affected by acids are least readily decomposed 
by alkali, and vice versa. Sucrose is scarcely acted upon by a weak alkali, 
but maltose and lactose are affected more readily. 

The monosaccharids are easily decomposed by alkalies, even very weak 
ones. If the sugar is allowed to stand in a solution with a weak alkali 



38 SUGAR COOKERY 

many substances may be formed. Decomposition is brought about so rapidly 
with strong alkalies that not so many products are formed with it. Nef 
states that, of the 116 possible decomposition products with dextrose and 
a weak alkali, 93 have been isolated. Very weak alkalies may cause re- 
arrangement of the molecule. In the manufacture of dextrose great care 
must be taken to keep the reaction acid to prevent an off color and taste. 
The action of an alkali upon dextrose produces first a yellow tinge which 
becomes deeper and finally brown if carried far enough. This decomposi- 
tion is called caramelization. With very slight caramelization of dextrose 
the flavor may not be very noticeable, but it may become strong and bitter, 
and characterized by a strong, pungent, acrid after-taste. In sections of the 
country where the water is very hard, enough decomposition to affect the 
flavor may be brought about in ordinary cooking. This is more noticeable 
when the sugar is cooked slowly. The addition of a little lemon juice, 
vinegar, or the acid salt, cream of tartar, will prevent the discoloration and 
the change in flavor. In some instances this browning or caramelization is 
an advantage. For example, baked beans brown better when dextrose is 
added than when sucrose is used. 

Levulose, like dextrose, is unstable in an alkaline solution, decomposing 
as readily or more so than dextrose and giving many decomposition prod- 
ucts. But in cookery its decomposition by alkalies can be prevented in the 
same way as that of dextrose. Candy made from honey often has a strong 
flavor that may be rather disagreeable, owing to decomposition of the 
dextrose and levulose during cooking. If just enough acid is added to com- 
bine with the alkali present, the characteristic flavor of honey is retained. 

Moisture-Absorbing Power of the Sugars 

All sugars should be stored in a dry place for they deteriorate if stored 
where it is damp. This power of absorbing moisture can be made use of 
to improve some foods, but it is a detriment in others. 

Browne reports that the sugars having the highest absorptive power from 
a saturated atmosphere are the levulose-containing substances : invert sugar, 
honey, levulose, and molasses. He finds that the percentage of water ab- 
sorbed has no relation to the percentage of levulose present. This would 
suggest that cakes made with levulose-containing products would not dry 
out so rapidly as cakes made with sucrose. In practise, this is found to be 
true. Cakes made with part levulose or levulose-containing substances do not 
dry out so rapidly as those made with sucrose. 

Honey and molasses are used in many family recipes for cookies, par- 
ticularly the kinds made for holidays, for they can be made a long time in 
advance of their intended use and they remain moist with storage — in many 
instances the moisture content seems to increase during storage. 

Invert sugar either added to food or formed by inversion during cooking 
is found in many food products. In the bakery trade it is used to prevent 



SOLUTIONS 39 

drying and checking. The acid in fruits inverts sucrose. The amount of 
total sugar that can be held in solution in a given quantity of liquid is 
greater if it contains a mixture of sucrose, levulose, and dextrose. Rich 
preserves made of fruit containing little acid do not crystallize so readily 
during storage if lemon juice is added when they are being made. The 
lemon juice brings about more inversion than the less acid fruit juice. The 
invert sugar does not crystallize so readily as the sucrose, the total quantity 
of sugar held in solution is greater, and there is less evaporation. 

The levulose-containing substances should be avoided for hard candies. 
Duryea states that maltose is better to use in hard candies than dextrose, 
because the candies remain drier. He also adds that another advantage 
of using maltose in hard candy is that maltose is not so readily affected 
by alkali. The decomposition caused by use of dextrose and alkaline w^ater 
is avoided. 

The Melting Point of the Sugars and the Effect of Heat 

When sugars are heated without the addition of water a point is reached 
at which they change from a crystalline to a liquid state. This is called 
the melting point. 

Mackenzie states that the melting point of sucrose is 160° to 161 °C. 
Impure solutions of sucrose will give variable melting points. After sugar 
is melted and cooled slowly it forms the hard amorphous sugar sometime? 
called ''barley sugar." The amorphous form of sugar like the amorphous 
sulfur slowly reverts to the crystalline form. If sucrose is heated above the 
melting point brownish-colored substances called caramel are formed. In 
the presence of moisture, caramelization may begin at temperatures below 
100°C. Caramel is composed of a number of substances, decomposition 
products of sucrose with loss of water. 

Maltose melts at about 100°C. Having a lower melting point than 
sucrose it decomposes more easily by heat. 

Dextrose crystallizes as the hydrate, CCH12O6.H2O, that is, one mole- 
cule of water is combined with the molecule of dextrose. When heated 
slowly it loses this water of crystallization between 50° and 60°C. Perkin 
and Kipping state that the melting point of the hydrate is 86°, and that of 
the anhydrous form is 146°C. 

The melting point of levulose is 95 °C. 

Solutions 

Sugar and other substances are used constantly in cookery processes. 
Therefore, it is desirable to know something about the properties of solu- 
tions. 

A solution is composed of two parts: one, the solute, is the dissolved 
substance; and the other, the solvent, is the substance in which the solute 



40 SUGAR COOKERY 

is dissolved. A solution is a homogeneous mixture. This means that it is 
uniformly mixed or alike in all parts. 

A solution may be a gas dissolved in a solid, a gas in metal; a gas in a 
liquid, air in water; a liquid in a liquid, alcohol in water; or a solid in 
a liquid, sugar in water. It is to the class of solids in liquids that many 
of our solutions in cookery belong. 

Solubility of Substances in Solution 

Solubility means the amount of a specific substance that will dissolve 
in a given volume of a specified solvent. If the solvent is not mentioned 
it is understood to be water. Solubility is generally expressed as the number 
of grams of solute that will dissolve in 100 cc. of solvent, and as the tem- 
perature affects solubility it is usually mentioned. If the temperature is not 
stated it is understood to be room temperature or 20° to 22°C. 

Factors determining the solubility. Temperature, the fineness of 
division and the nature of the solute, and the nature of the solvent deter- 
mine the solubility to a great extent. Some substances are highly, others 
only slightly, soluble in water, and still others are highly insoluble in this 
solvent. Some substances will dissolve best in alcohol, or chloroform, or 
ether, or benzine. Some liquids, like alcohol and water, will dissolve in all 
proportions, but there is a limit to the solubility of all substances of a 
crystalline form. 

Fineness of division of the solute. A larger amount of the crystal- 
line solute is soluble if it is very finely divided or powdered than if left 
in large crystals. This does not refer to the ease or quickness of solution 
but to the total number of grams dissolved in 100 cc. of the solvent. This 
increase in solubility is due to the increased surface energy of the smaller 
particles in the solvent. The diameter of the particles must be less than 1/x 
to increase the solubility to any great extent. 

Temperature. The solubility of most crystalline substances in w^ater 
is increased by heating, though some are little affected by temperature 
change, and a few are less soluble in hot water than in cold. Sodium 
chloride, common salt, is an example of a substance that is little affected 
by temperature change. At 0°C. about 35.6 grams will dissolve in 100 cc. 
of water, and about 39 grams at 100°. Calcium hydroxide is only half as 
soluble at 100° as at 20°. The solubility of the sugars is increased by 
elevation of temperature. At 0°C., 179 grams of sucrose will dissolve; at 
100°C. 487 grams will dissolve. 

Addition of other substances. Two forms of the same compound 
may give different solubilities. Thus anhydrous lactose (without water of 
crystallization) has one solubility and the hydrated form has another. Some- 
times the addition of another substance, organic or inorganic, to the solu- 
tion will increase or decrease the solubility of the solute. If, after all the 
sucrose possible is dissolved, some potassium acetate, sodium chloride, or 



SUCROSE 41 

many other salts, is added to the solution, more sucrose can be dissolved. 
This may a£Fect the solubility of sugar in candy making, for it is known 
that different waters, with different proportions and kinds of minerals, do 
not always give identical results, with the same sugar, for the same kind 
of candy. 

Saturated solutions. Once all the solute is dissolved that can possi- 
bly be held by a definite amount of solvent at a constant temperature, any 
excess of the solute remains unchanged. The saturated solution is one that 
contains all the dissolved solute that it can take up when in contact with 
undissolved solute. In other words, it is a solution which when placed 
with excess of the solute at a definite temperature is in equilibrium, i.e., 
there is neither increase nor decrease in concentration of the solute. 

Supersaturated solutions. One should not define a saturated solution 
as one containing all the solute it can hold, for a supersaturated solution 
holds more than a saturated one. If water is heated to 70°C. and all the 
sucrose added that can be dissolved by the water at this temperature, one 
has a saturated solution. There should be no excess of the solid left with 
the liquid. If this solution is carefully cooled to 40°C. without stirring 
more sucrose will .be in solution than could have been if the water had not 
been heated above 40°. The cooling of a saturated solution leads to the 
formation of crystals, and any excess beyond saturation is gradually pre- 
cipitated as the temperature drops, though crystallization may not begin 
immediately. But some substances, like the sugars, require longer than 
others for crystallization to commence, unless the solution is stirred or 
agitated. 

The Solubility of the Sugars 

The solubility of the sugars determines their use to a certain extent. It 
is obvious to one who does a great deal of cooking that a sugar that requires 
6 pounds of water to dissolve 1 pound of sugar, could not be used for con- 
centrated sugar products like jellies, jams, frostings, or even cakes. 

Sucrose. Sucrose has the greatest solubility of the disaccharid sugars. 
Browne in his "Handbook of Sugar Analysis" states that, at 20°C., 204 
grams are soluble in 100 cc. of water. Thus at room temperature about 
2 grams of sucrose are soluble in 1 cc. of water. At 100°C. 487 grams of 
sucrose are soluble in 100 cc. of water. For solubilities at other tempera- 
tures see Table 5. 

In Table 5 the solubility of sucrose is expressed in two ways. In column 
2 is given the amount of sucrose dissolved in water to make 100 grams 
of solution. Thus at 0°C., 64.18 grams of sucrose are dissolved in 35.82 
grams of water to give a total of 100 grams of solution. The third column 
states the number of grams of sucrose dissolved in 100 grams of water at a 
definite temperature.

Percentage o£ Sucrose in Saturated Solutions. From Table 5 
the percentage of sugar may be obtained. At 0°C., 64.18 grams of sugar and 
35.82 grams of water give 100 grams of solution, so that the number of 
grams of sugar may be read as percentage of sucrose or 64.18 per cent. 

Maltose. Maltose is not a common sugar on the market. When used 
to make jelly, it crystallizes from the jelly, like dextrose. Gillis has re- 
ported the following solubility. 

Lactose. The use of lactose in the home is limited because it is not very 
soluble and lacks sweetness. According to Greenleaf, if lactose is crystal- 
lized below 93.5°C. the alpha hydrate form is obtained. Above 93.5°C. the 
beta lactose is formed. Beta lactose is about one-fourth sweeter than 
alpha hydrate and dissolves more rapidly, hence does not leave a sandy 
sensation in the mouth. Hudson states that at the final solubility of lactose 
there are 1^ parts of the anhydrous to 1 of the hydrate. Hunziker and

Nissen state that its solution is complete after shaking it 170 hours at

chloride to a lactose solution increased the solubility of lactose from 28.6 
to 29.5 grams per 100 grams of water at 32°C. An analysis of the pre- 
cipitate showed the crystals to be a compourd of lactose with calcium 
chloride. The following table of solubility of lactose is from Hudson.

SUGAR COOKERY 



Dextrose. Dextrose and levulose are the only monosaccharid sugars 
used in cookery to any extent. Dextrose has in recent years been put on the 
market in crystalline form under the trade name of "Cerelose." Combs and 
Bele give the solubility of "Cerelose" as shown in Table 8.

Thus at room temperature about 1 part of "Cerelose" is soluble in 1 
part of water. "Cerelose" is less soluble than sucrose and goes into solution 
at a slower rate. 

The solubility of dextrose limits its use in cookery to a certain extent. 
Jellies average about 60 to 70 parts of sugar by weight and 30 to 40 
parts of liquid or juice. Dextrose at room temperature is soluble in water 
to the extent of 1 part of dextrose to 1 part of water. Since the finished 
jellies average over 50 per cent of sugar, when dextrose alone is used 
in jelly it soon begins to crystallize after the jelly is cooled. If the jelly is 
not covered it crystallizes very rapidly. 

Levulose. Levulose is very soluble. It has a greater solubility than 
sucrose. Since it is very soluble it must be present in very large quantities 
before it crystallizes and is therefore very hard to crystallize. The data in 
the table for the solubility of levulose are obtained from the results of 
Jackson, Silsbee and Proffitt. The data in the third column are computed 
from the grams of levulose soluble in 100 grams of solution. 

Properties of Solutions 



A solute dissolved in a solvent affects the properties of the solvent or in 
other words alters certain of its constant characteristics. No discussion of 
osmotic pressure is given ; the effect on the freezing point is discussed in 
the chapter on freezing. These characteristics may be listed as follows: 

a. The vapor tension is lowered. 

b. The boiling point is elevated. 

c. The freezing point is lowered. 

d. The osmotic pressure is increased. 



EFFECT OF THE SOLUTE ON VAPOR TENSION 45 



Vapor tension. Vapor tension may be defined as the vapor or gaseous 
pressure of a liquid. The vapor tension of a liquid depends upon the amount 
of vapor formed. Some liquids, like alcohol, evaporate rapidly and have a 
high vapor tension. Others, like water, evaporate more slowly. This gaseous 
pressure soon reaches a maximum at any given temperature. The maximum 
pressure at a definite temperature represents the vapor tension of the liquid.

Effect of the solute on vapor tension. When a substance is dis- 
solved in a liquid the vapor tension of the solvent is lowered, i.e., there is 
less tendency to pass into the vapor state, hence the gaseous pressure is 
decreased. 

If water is the solvent, there is a tendency with a high concentration of 
some substances for vapor from the air to enter the solution, thus increas- 
ing the quantity of the solvent. This is particularly true of sugar solutions, 
when the humidity of the air is high and the solutions are concentrated. 
On damp, rainy days, fondant and similar candies have to be beaten for 
a longer time to crystallize, unless they are cooked to a little higher tem- 
perature so as to obtain a greater concentration. 

The fact that it is harder for the vapor to leave the surface of the liquid 
when there is a soluble substance in it is made use of in the following or 
similar ways to keep food moist. A covered vessel containing food loses 
moisture from the food until the air space is saturated with vapor. If the 
vessel is tight enough, the food does not dry out to an appreciable extent. 
If two dishes are placed in an enclosed vessel, one of them containing 
water and the other a heavy sugar solution, the sugar solution, since it 
loses vapor with difficulty and absorbs liquid, will gradually absorb water 
from the other dish. If two foods are placed in the same container, the 
one with more sugar will gradually absorb moisture from the other. This 
is why an apple is often put in a box with a fruit cake, the apple drying 



46 SUGAR COOKERY 

up and keeping the cake moist. Cake and bread should not be stored to- 
gether, as the bread will become dry quickly. 

The Boiling Point of Water and Solutions 

Water standing in an open vessel gradually evaporates, so that eventually 
all the water disappears in the form of vapor. We know that evaporation 
takes place more rapidly on warm days than on cool ones, and more rapidly 
from a wide shallow vessel than from a narrow deep one. As the tempera- 
ture is increased, the rapidity of the motion of the molecules is increased. 
Therefore a larger number escape from the liquid as the temperature 
increases, most of them being carried away by air currents. 

Saturated vapor. If we cover a vessel of water, leaving an air space 
between the surface of the liquid and the cover, evaporation takes place 
for a time just as from an uncovered vessel. But when the vapor cannot be 
carried away, the air above the liquid soon becomes filled with vapor mole- 
cules. Of course some of them reenter the liquid. When they are entering 
the surface of the liquid as rapidly as they are leaving it, the air is said to be 
saturated and is in equilibrium with the liquid, i.e., the saturation point 
is reached when the air holds all the vapor possible at that temperature. 
If the temperature is increased the velocity of the molecules is increased, 
and they leave the surface of the liquid faster than they enter until equi- 
librium is again established. If the temperature is reduced, a part of the 
vapor condenses into the liquid and forms drops of liquid on the sides and 
cover of the vessel or on the surface of the liquid. 

The boiling point. When water is heated slowly enough, air bubbles 
are noticed forming on the sides and bottom of the pan. They come from 
the air that has been held in solution by the water. A similar thing may 
be noticed on a warm day when a glass or pitcher of cool water is left in 
a warm room. The air bubbles collect on the sides of the glass or pitcher, 
and if the vessel is jarred many of them will rise to the top of the water 
and break. If heating of the water is continued the vapor begins to form. 
Many of the first vapor bubbles collapse before they reach the surface. 

Since the heat is applied at the bottom of the pan the vapor forms at 
the bottom of the liquid. With the increased speed of the molecules, due 
to the increased temperature, greater pressure is obtained, so that the 
formation of vapor is more rapid until a point is reached at which the 
rate of loss of heat from the water in the escaping vapor is equal to the 
heat received by the liquid. If the rate at which the heat is applied is con- 
stant, the bubbles are uniform in size. If a thermometer is held in the liquid 
it is found that when this point is reached the temperature is constant. 
This is the boiling point. A child might say that when a liquid is bubbling 
it is boiling, and it would be a fairly good definition. However, the chemist 
or physicist would word his definition differently. With vapor formation, 
pressure is exerted. Since the bubble is less dense than the liquid it comes 



ELEVATION OF THE BOILING POINT 47 

to the surface. But the bubble cannot reach the surface until the pressure 
within it is just a little greater than the pressure of the liquid on the 
bubble. The pressure on the bubble in an open pan comes from the weight 
of the column of liquid above it and the atmospheric pressure on the 
surface of the liquid. Another way to define the boiling point is to say that 
it is the temperature at which the pressure of the saturated vapor within 
the liquid is just greater than the outside pressure on the surface of the 
liquid. 

If you live at sea level the boiling point of water is 100°C. The Bureau 
of Standards defines the boiling point of water as the point at which 
ebullition is violent. Slow-bubbling water does not register quite as high 
a temperature as rapidly bubbling water, but in cooking food in water 
there is no great advantage in having the water boiling violently. The food 
will cook nearly as rapidly in the slower bubbling water. With gas or 
electricity it is an economy of fuel to lower the heat when the water begins 
to boil, unless it is desirable to evaporate the liquid quickly. 

The conversion of water from a liquid to a gaseous state requires a 
certain amount of energy. This energy is expressed in terms of heat. To 
change a gram of water at 100°C. to vapor at 100° requires about 540 
calories of heat. If the heat applied to boiling water is increased, the 
quantity of water changed to vapor in a given time is increased. The vapor 
escapes from the surface of the liquid, but in a pan the free surface is 
limited. However, in boiling water it escapes from the free surface and 
from the surface of the bubbles. The temperature of the water cannot be 
increased because the heat lost by evaporation is equal to the heat received. 
If the heat is increased, the heat lost by evaporation is increased and the 
surface of the bubbles is increased enormously beyond the free surface of 
the liquid to aid evaporation. 

Lowering the boiling point. The boiling point of a liquid may be 
lowered by reducing the pressure on the liquid. This may be done by 
boiling the liquid in a partial vacuum. The boiling point is also lowered 
with increased elevation above sea level. The atmospheric pressure is not 
so great at high altitudes because of the lessened column or depth of air. 
For each 960 feet above sea level the boiling point is decreased 1°C. 

Elevation of the boiling point. The boiling point of a liquid can 
be elevated by increasing the pressure upon it. This may be done by pre- 
venting the vapor above the liquid from escaping. If a soluble substance 
is added to a liquid the resulting solution has a higher boiling point than 
the pure liquid. 

The pressure of a gas increases as the temperature increases. When 
vapor is confined, as in a pressure cooker, the boiling point of a liquid 
in the cooker is elevated. As the temperature is increased, the pressure 
of the confined vapor on the surface of the liquid is increased. Therefore 
a higher temperature is required to form great enough pressure in the 
vapor bubbles within the liquid for them to reach the surface of the liquid. 



48 SUGAR COOKERY 

Thus the boiling point is elevated. The higher the temperature of the 
confined vapor the greater the pressure on the liquid. The greater the 
pressure on the liquid the higher the boiling point. 

The boiling point o£ solutions. Each gram-molecular weight (mole) 
of a non-ionized substance in a liter of water elevates the boiling point 
0.52°C. A gram-molecular weight of a substance is its atomic or com- 
bined atomic weights. For example, sucrose is composed of carbon, hydro- 
gen, and oxygen with the formula C12H22O11. The atomic weight of 
carbon is 12; that of hydrogen is 1; of oxygen, 16. Thus 12 carbons, 22 
hydrogens, and 1 1 oxygens give a molecular weight of 342 grams. The 
boiling point of a liter of water containing 342 grams of sucrose is elevated 
0.52°C. Two moles of sucrose would elevate the boiling point 1.04°C. 
The boiling point can be elevated as long as the substance added is soluble. 
When the solution becomes saturated, or the point is reached at which no 
more can be dissolved, the boiling point is constant for substances that 
behave normally in solution. If boiling is continued so that the solvent 
is vaporized, the excess solute beyond saturation is crystallized. This is 
illustrated in Experiment 3 in the laboratory outline. 

Effect of ionized substances on the boiling point. Some sub- 
stances when dissolved in water are ionized. In a solution of sodium 
chloride, for example, not only sodium chloride molecules are found but 
also sodium ions and chlorine ions. 

NaCl :^^ ^ Na+H-Cl- 

The atomic weight of sodium is 23 and that of chlorine is 35. If 58 
grams of sodium chloride (a mole) are added to a liter of water, and 
the sodium chloride is completely ionized, the boiling point will be elevated 
1.04°C. The mole of sodium will elevate it 0.52° and the mole of chlorine 
will elevate it 0.52°. Sometimes a substance that ionizes in solution is not 
completely ionized. When this happens, the boiling point is elevated accord- 
ing to the degree of ionization. 

At high altitudes it is possible to cook foods more rapidly by adding salt 
to the cooking water. To be very effective this requires such a large quan- 
tity of salt that the food becomes too salty. It may be used for potatoes 
that are not peeled. 

Sugar solutions behave abnormally in regard to the boiling point. In 
Experiment 4 it is found that the sugar solutions do not behave like the 
salt solution. They do not reach a constant boiling point. A mole of sucrose 
(342 grams) measures about 1^ cups. It can be readily seen by consulting 
the solubility table of sucrose that its solubility will account for only a 
partial elevation of the boiling point. The boiling point of the sugar solu- 
tion increases with its concentration until the melting point of the sugar 
is reached. Occasionally, in cooking a sucrose solution (Experiment 4A), 
some of the sucrose crystallizes on the edge of the pan, thermometer, and 
top of the sirup, similar to the salt solution, but this is not the usual result. 



CRYSTALLIZATION 



49 



When the melting point of the sucrose is reached these crystals melt. 
Temperatures far above the melting point of the sugars can be obtained. 
However, with the very high temperatures, caramelization or decomposi- 
tion of the sucrose occurs quite rapidly. 

There is no very satisfactory explanation for the abnormal behavior of 
the sugars. Chemists tell us that one explanation may be that the sugar 
and water combine chemically giving a new compound with a new boiling 
point, or the combination of the sugar with the water may give a very 
concentrated solution, thus elevating the boiling point. 

Boiling point of sucrose solutions. Browne in his "Handbook on 
Sugar Analysis" lists the boiling point of sucrose solutions as follows.

A 10 per cent solution of sugar is one that contains 10 grams of sugar 
and 90 grams of water or one having these proportions. 

Heat o£ solution. Some substances that are soluble may liberate heat 
when they go into solution. The example of mixing water and sulfuric 
acid (H2SO4) is a well-known one. Other substances, instead of giving 
off heat, cause the temperature to drop when they go into solution. They 
are said to have a negative heat of solution, and heat is absorbed. 

If sugar and water of the same temperature are mixed, the temperature 
of the solution drops as the sugar is dissolving. Salt and many other sub- 
stances also absorb heat as they go into solution. When the substances that 
absorb heat as they go into solution are crystallized from solution, heat 
is liberated and the temperature is elevated slightly. This is often notice- 
able in making fondant or fudge. Frequently the sirup softens so that it 
is not so viscous and is easier to stir when crystallization starts. As the 
first crystals formed are not visible, one may think that the sirup is not 
going to crystallize because of this softening. It is more noticeable with 
larger amounts of fondant and fudge than with very small ones. 

Crystallization 



In making icings, frostings, or candy like fondant and fudge, it is neces- 
sary to crystallize the sugar solution. For crystallization to occur, nuclei 
must form in the solution. To these nuclei the material of the solution is 
added to form crystals. Both the rate of formation of nuclei and the rate 
of crystallization are affected by the nature of the crystallizing substance, 



50 SUGAR COOKERY 

the concentration, the temperature, agitation, and the impurities present in 
the solution. 

Nature of the crystallizing substance. Some substances like salt 
crystallize readily from water solution. It requires only a very slight super- 
saturation to start nuclear formation, and all excess salt in the solution 
beyond the saturation point is precipitated as crystals. Some substances do 
not form nuclei or crystallize so readily as salt. With sucrose it is often 
necessary to have a considerable degree of supersaturation before crystal- 
lization commences. Sucrose crystallizes more readily than levulose. 

Formation of nuclei. Nuclei cannot form and crystallization cannot 
occur except from a supersaturated solution. The formation of nuclei, that 
is the uniting of atoms to form nuclei, is influenced by several factors. If a 
solution is left to stand, a few nuclei may form spontaneously in various 
places, and from these nuclei crystallization proceeds. When only a few 
nuclei develop spontaneously in the solution, the crystals grow to large 
size. Usually nuclei formation and crystallization do not begin immedi- 
ately after supersaturation occurs. The rate of nuclear formation may be 
favored by specks of dust in the solution. Agitation or stirring of a solution 
increases the rate of nuclear formation. A drop in temperature at first 
favors, and then retards, the formation of nuclei. Instead of spontaneous 
formation of nuclei, seeding a solution may be used to start cr3'stallization. 

Seeding. When crystals of the same material are added to start crystal- 
lization the process is called seeding. These crystals serve as nuclei for 
crystal growth. If the quantity of crystals added is large and the size 
of the crystals small, it serves as many nuclei in the solution, and the 
resulting crystals are small. If the quantity of material added is very 
small, the nuclei formed are few in number and the crystals formed are 
large. One may think of all crystals as being large enough to be visible, 
whereas many of them may be very small, so small in fact that they may 
float in the air. Tutton tells of crystals difficult to obtain, but after being 
obtained several times in the laboratory they were then easily obtained. 
If crystals are floating in the air there is the possibility that they may 
serve to seed solutions, and thus start crystallization. 

Rate of crystallization. To the nuclei formed in the solution new 
molecules from the solution are deposited, in a regular order or manner, 
so that each crystal has a typical shape. One side or face of a crystal may 
grow more rapidly than another. The rate at which the nuclei grow to 
larger size is called the rate of crystallization. This rate may be favored 
by the concentration of the solution and its temperature; it may be hin- 
dered by foreign substances. 

Concentration of the solution. A more concentrated solution favors 
the formation of nuclei. A fondant sirup cooked to 114°C. contains less 
water and is more concentrated than one cooked to 111°C. Thus nuclei 
form more readily in the one cooked to 114°C. Large, well-shaped crystals 
form more readily if the degree of supersaturation is not too great. The 



ADSORPTION AND IMPURITIES IN THE SOLUTION 51 

most favorable supersaturation for crystal growth, of a sucrose solution 
boiled to 112°C., is that between 70° and 90°C. Although crystallization 
occurs in a very short time when the sirup is stirred at these temperatures, 
the crystals formed are larger than when the sirup is cooled to a lower 
temperature. See Figs. 1 and 3. Supersaturation and a low temperature 
are desirable for the development of small crystals. The viscosity of a very 
supersaturated sirup delays crystal growth. 

Temperature at which crystallization occurs. It is a well-known 
fact that, in general, chemical precipitates come down more coarsely 
crystalline if crystallized at high temperatures. Barium sulfate is a good 
example of a substance that crystallizes in large crystals at high tempera- 
tures. The sugars follow this general rule. Other things being equal, i.e., 
concentration, etc., the higher the temperature at which crystal formation 
occurs, the coarser the crystals formed. 

A drop in temperature at first favors the formation of nuclei, and then 
hinders it. Crystallization is favored in sugar sirups by cooling to a certain 
temperature, but is hindered when cooled to a lower temperature. Since 
the viscosity of a saturated sugar solution becomes increasingly greater as 
the temperature falls below 70°C., crystal formation is also slower as the 
temperature falls. 

Agitation. Stirring a solution favors the formation of nuclei and 
hinders the depositing of the material of the solution on the nuclei already 
formed. Hence, crystals in solutions that are stirred do not develop to 
the size that they do in spontaneous crystallization. Bancroft states that 
"The mean size of crystals is determined by the total amount of the 
material crystallizing and number of crystals. The really important thing 
therefore is the number of nuclei which are formed under any given 
conditions." If small crystals are desired, then the conditions should be such 
that many nuclei are formed. Small crystals are obtained in sirups of 
definite concentration and temperature, if the sirup is stirred until the 
mass is kneadable. However, if the sirup is stirred for only a short time, 
some nuclei are formed, but after agitation is stopped, the formation oi 
new nuclei is not favored and crystal growth is favored. Fig. 2 shows 
crystals from fondant stirred for only a few seconds. The crystals are 
much larger than those in Fig. 1, which shows crystals from fondant that 
was stirred until the mass could be kneaded. The same thing is illustrated 
in Fig. 10, which shows crystals from divinity that would not quite hold 
its shape but spread when dropped on oil paper. The crystals from the same 
divinity (Fig. 9) which was stirred until it would hold its shape, but was 
glossy and not dry in appearance when dropped on oil paper, are small. 
Divinity with the small crystals is very smooth and velvety on the palate. 
This emphasizes the importance of stirring candy and icing sirups until 
practically all the material is crystallized, if small crystals are desired. 

Adsorption and impurities in the solution. Freundlich states that 
*'in the vast majority of cases the foreign substance lowers the rate of 



52 SUGAR COOKERY 

crystallization." The rate of crystal growth is retarded because of adsorp- 
tion of the foreign substance by the crystals. If the substance is strongly 
adsorbed, crystallization may be retarded to such a rate that it is practically 
abolished, even though the solution is very supersaturated with the crystal- 
lizing substance. Since the adsorption prevents crystal growth, if a pre- 
cipitate is formed in the presence of a substance strongly adsorbed by the 
precipitate, it will crystallize in a much finer state of subdivision. Some- 
times the substance is more strongly adsorbed at one face than at another, 
so that this face grows more slowly than is customary and thus becomes 
comparatively larger in relation to other faces. This explains why crystals 
from pure solutions may have different shapes from those obtained from 
impure solutions. Speaking of sugar manufacture and crystallization of 
sucrose, Zitkowski says, "If the content of non-sugars in the solution is 
high enough crystallization may be prevented even though evaporation is 
carried to the point of dryness." The addition of other carbohydrates, such 
as dextrose, levulose, and starch, to sucrose solutions retards the crystal- 
lization of the sucrose. The extent to which they delay crystallization 
depends upon how strongly they are adsorbed and the proportion added. 

Other substances strongly adsorbed by sucrose crystals are fat and 
proteins. Hence, the use of butter, milk, and egg white all retard crystal 
growth. 

Crystallization o£ sucrose in sugar manufacture. In sugar manu- 
facture, when it is time to start crystallization in the mass of boiling sirup, 
the sugar boiler may lower the pressure, w^hich causes violent boiling or 
agitation, or he may add a sirup or water to change the concentration or 
temperature. He may also seed the sirup by adding a sufficient amount of 
small sugar crj^stals. The crystals when first formed are too small to be 
visible in the sirup but grow to visible size. This may be in a few moments. 
The sugar boiler controls the temperature, pressure, and density to bring 
the crystals to the desired size. If they are too small when finished, too 
much sugar is lost in washing the liquid from the crystals. If they are too 
large, the public does not care for them. 

Grades of sugar. Rice states that there is a surprising lack of informa- 
tion about the various grades of sucrose sugar produced and their specific 
uses, probably because the information has not been given general circula- 
tion. He lists 36 grades of sucrose, to which may be added many more 
grades made for a specific use with a particular equipment. The following 
classifications are those given by Rice. 

The refined sugar distributed for household use is somewhat smaller 
in grain size than that found some years ago, because the general demand 
has been for a more rapidly dissolving sugar. As the finer grain gives a 
whiter appearance, the tendency has been to produce a finer sugar. Fine 
Granulated is produced in the largest quantity of any grade. In the same 
class, each with increasingly finer grain or crystal size, are Extra-fine 
Granulated, Berry or Fruit or Fruit Powdered (it is designated by all 



GRADES OF SUGAR 53 

these names), and Coating. Rice states the name Fruit Powdered has 
nothing to do with fruit nor is the sugar powdered. The "Coating" is used 
where unusually fine crystals are desired. 

Four sugars, produced especially for use when high-temperature cooking 
is necessary in making clear hard candies and very white fondants or pan- 
coated goods, or when an extremely hard grain must be used, are Coarse, 
Standard, Medium, and Manufacturers' Grade. Manufacturers are tend- 
ing to use Manufacturers' Granulated, which varies from the others only 
in that it is the finest of the four and will dissolve much faster. In this 
same class are the Sanding sugars. Sanding sugars are used to sprinkle 
upon the surfaces of many soft candies and fruit products to prevent their 
sticking together. They are also used to sand gum drops and fruits which 
are to have further quantities of sugar crystallized upon their surfaces. The 
crystals of Sanding sugar are generally nearly perfect and exact in size. 

There are generally produced three grades of machine powdered sugar 
differing only in the degree of fineness: Coarse Powdered, having about 
the fineness of Coating sugar; Standard Powdered, being somewhat finer; 
and XXXX, commonly known as Confectioners', being as fine as practical 
to produce with the ordinary type of sugar mill. A still finer powdered 
sugar, made with an improved powdering mill, is sometimes designated as 
6X or Special XXXX. This last sugar is particularly valuable in prepar- 
ing cold icings, because they remain softer longer than when prepared 
with coarser powdered sugars. The smaller the particle size the greater 
the amount of moisture held, because of the proportionally greater surface 
area. Rice states the number of X's applied to different sugars means 
nothing in actual fineness. Powdered sugars may be treated to prevent 
caking. Usually 3 per cent of cornstarch is added. A tri-calcium phosphate 
has been introduced for this purpose and 1 per cent of it is more effective 
than 3 per cent of cornstarch. Its use is not as yet permitted in some states. 

Rice describes a new and different sugar called transformed sugar. It is 
produced in the same way as refined sugar up to the point of crystallization. 
It is then treated to give a very small grain with exceedingly irregular 
surface, the surface being penetrated by cracks or recesses which cause the 
grain to crumble easily, and, because of the relatively large surface, to 
dissolve almost instantly when dropped into water. The particles may be 
crushed easily and are used in chocolate coatings. "The crevices in these 
grains are very small and naturally are full of air. When this sugar is used 
for creaming with shortening in the production of cake or in very dry 
dough for biscuits, this finely divided air cannot collect and escape in large 
bubbles but acts as a leavening agent and reduces the necessity for most, if 
not all, other leavening agents." Because of its fine and fluffy condition it 
can replace powdered sugars in various prepared drinks and food mixtures. 
At present there are seven grades of transformed sugar, varying in fluffiness 
and color. 

Soft brown sugars are graded according to color and range from a nearly 



54 SUGAR COOKERY 

white No. 1 to No. 15, which is as dark as roasted coffee. The grain of 
these sugars is softer than that of refined sugar and the percentage of invert 
sugar increases with increasing darkness in color. 

Amorphous sugar. When sucrose is melted, or when solutions of 
sucrose are heated to high temperatures and then allowed to cool, crystal- 
lization does not occur immediately. A very brittle, very hard, solid, 
transparent mass is formed. This form of sucrose is know^n as amorphous 
sugar. It crystallizes very slowly, sometimes taking several months or 
years to crystallize. Candies of this type are extremely hard. Some candies 
are cooked to stages between those of the soft crystalline ones and the 
hard amorphous forms. Caramels are examples of this type of candy — 
they are fairly soft, yet are not crystallized. 

Crystallization in candy making. Large crystals are the result of 
growth, for which several days or weeks may be required. The growth 
of the crystals is favored if the solution is not stirred, if the supersatura- 
tion is not great, and if no crystals are added to the solution. Since small 
crystals are desired in candy making, the procedure followed is the op- 
posite of that for obtaining large crystals. The period of crystallization 
is short, usually not over 30 minutes is required, the supersaturation is 
great, and the solution is stirred after supersaturation is attained. 

Stages of Cookery of Sucrose Solutions in Candy Making 

The "cold-water" test. In the "cold-water" test, one can tell, from 
the firmness or hardness of a portion of the sirup w^hich has been dropped 
into cold water, whether the sirup has reached a concentration required 
for the type of candy desired. The degree of firmness in the cold-w^ater 
test is designated by different descriptive terms, such as soft ball, medium 
ball, hard ball, and brittle. It should be remembered that there is no 
definite stage between a soft ball and a medium one, but as the concen- 
tration of the solution gradually increases, the firmness of the sirup tested 
in cold water increases. One factor that causes variations in this test is the 
fact that the colder the water in which the sirup is tested the firmer the 
tested portion. Another cause for variation is that the portion being tested 
is not always left long enough to become cooled. 

Yet with long practise the cold-water test can be used with great preci- 
sion to denote the stage of cookery of a sirup. It is the different interpreta- 
tions of what constitutes a soft or medium ball that makes this test a more 
difficult one to use. The number of terms used by different persons to sug- 
gest the same stage of cookery is illustrated by the following. In looking 
over a large number of recipes for a candy contest, it was interesting to 
find that of 600 recipes nearly 200 had exactly the same proportion of 
sugar, corn sirup, water, and egg white. But the directions for making the 
cold-water test in these 200 recipes varied. Here are some of the terms used 
to describe the portion of sirup tested in the cold water : Soft ball, medium 



ADDITION OF CORN SIRUP AND OTHER SUGARS 55 

soft ball, medium firm ball, firm ball, hard ball, solid ball, real hard, very 
hard, hardens, threads, soft crack, cracks, crackles, cracks and hops, hairs, 
spins hairs, strings, snaps, breaks, and brittle. 

Stages of cookery. In part the descriptions of stages of cookery of 
sugar sirups are from "Terminology Used in Food Preparation." A sucrose 
solution that has reached a concentration indicated by a temperature of 
110° to 112°C. does not form a ball when a portion of the sirup is tested 
in ice water, but spins a two-inch thread when dropped from a fork or 
spoon. 

At a temperature of 113° to 115°C. a soft ball is formed when a 
portion of the sirup is tested in ice water. This ball is easily molded in the 
water, but does not retain its shape at room temperature. Sirup cooked to 
this stage is used for fondant, fudge, and penuchi. 

At a temperature of 118°C. a firmer ball is obtained. At 122°C. the 
ball is still harder and less readily molded in the water. At 122°C. the 
ball retains its shape at room temperature. Sirups for caramels are cooked 
to 118° to 122°C. Temperatures of 118° to 123°C. are used for sucrose 
sirups that are to be poured over beaten egg white. 

The sirup at temperatures of 121° to 130°C. forms an increasingly 
harder ball, which holds its shape, yet is plastic, when a portion is dropped 
into ice water; it is used for popcorn balls, nougat, divinity, and some 
taffies. The sirup at temperatures of 132° to 143°, called the soft-crack 
stage, separates into threads which are hard but not brittle when dropped 
into ice water. It is used for butterscotch and taffies. Sirups cooked to 149° 
to 154°C., the hard-crack stage, separate into separate threads which are 
hard and brittle when dropped into cold water ; used for brittles and glaces. 

The length of the thread or hair that forms when a fork or spoon 
containing some of the sirup is lifted into the air may also be used to 
indicate the stage of cookery. 

Effect upon stage of cookery of addition of corn sirup and 
other sugars to sucrose solutions. The addition of corn sirups and 
other sugars to sucrose solutions modifies the firmness of the portion tested 
at a definite temperature in cold water. 

Commercial corn sirup is composed of dextrin, dextrose, maltose, water, 
and a small amount of ash. Frandsen, Rovner, and Luithly state that its 
composition is as follows: 

Per Cent 

Dextrin 29 . 8 to 45 . 3 

Maltose 4.6 to 19.3 

Dextrose 34 . 3 to 36 . 5 

Ash 0.32 to 0.52 

Water .• 14.2 to 17.2 

Since the composition of corn sirups may vary slightly, this may result 
in different degrees of firmness when different corn sirups are used with 



56 



SUGAR COOKERY 



sucrose solutions. The use of corn sirup with sucrose in taffy, brittles, or 
caramels, candies that do not require crystallization, produces a definite 
stage of hardness when determined by the cold-water test at a lower 
temperature than when sucrose is used alone. Dextrin is the ingredient of 
the corn sirup that brings about this result, for if dextrin is used alone with 
sucrose the temperature for a definite degree of hardness is still lower than 
when corn sirup is used. In some of the early references on sugar cookery 
the term glucose is used for corn sirup. 

Table 1 1 shows the effect of different proportions of sugar upon the 
stage of hardness in sugar cookery. Miss Daniels has reported similar 
results in part.

It can be seen from this table that the greater the proportion of corn 
sirup used the lower the temperature to which the sirup needs to be 
cooked for a definite stage of hardness. 

Fondant 



Fondant is made when sucrose is cooked with water to a definite 
temperature, the sirup is cooled and beaten, and the mass crystallizes. 
According to accepted standards for good fondant, it should be snowy 
white. The crystals should be so small that they are imperceptible and 
not gritty on the palate. The fondant should be soft enough to be plastic 
and velvety but not dry and crumbly. 

Cooking of fondant. Enough water should be added to dissolve all 
the sugar during the cooking period. With rapid boiling a larger proportion 
of water can be used. With a slow fire and slow boiling, it is preferable to 
use less water, or a long time is required for the cooking process. With 
larger quantities of sugar the proportion of water is reduced because 



CONCENTRATION AND TEMPERATURE 57 

evaporation is relatively more rapid from the small quantity of sirup. 
Covering the pan during the first part of the cooking period allow^s the 
steam to dissolve and wash dow^n crystals from the sides of the pan. 

Some directions state not to stir the sirup while it is boiling. It is well 
to stir it to be sure all the sugar is dissolved, so that there are no crystals 
in the sirup to start crystallization while it is cooling. The danger in 
stirring candy while it is boiling comes from splashing the sirup on the 
sides of the pan. These drops of sirup on the side of the pan become dry 
and nuclei form which serve as a basis for crystallization while the sirup 
is cooling. A damp cloth is often used to swab the sides of the pan to 
prevent nuclei and crystals forming there during the cooking of the sirup. 
Since boiling solutions of sugars are not saturated solutions, any candy 
can be stirred as much as desired while it is boiling without causing 
crystallization, provided the sirup is not splashed on the sides of the pan. 
But after the sirup stops boiling it cools quickly and soon reaches the super- 
saturation point. If the sirup is poured for cooling from the pan in which 
it is cooked, it should be done quickly. Directions often state not to scrape 
the portion clinging to the pan with the spoon. Of course this is because 
the small amount of sirup left on the sides of the pan soon cools to the 
supersaturation point, and if it is stirred, as it must be in scraping it 
from the sides of the pan, crystals may form that will seed the entire 
mass. The thermometer should not be allowed to roll around in the sirup 
while the sirup is cooling for this agitates the sirup. The pan should be 
set level so that all parts of the sirup cool equally. The container in which 
the fondant is poured to cool should have a smooth surface, as rough 
surfaces may induce crystallization. 

In the preceding pages the factors determining the size of crystals in 
sugar crystallization are discussed. These factors are applicable in making 
fondant and fudge. 

Concentration and temperature for cooking the sirup. A sucrose 
solution containing 80 per cent of sucrose, i.e., 80 grams of sucrose and 
20 grams of water, boils at 112°C., is saturated at 90°C. and super- 
saturated below 90°C. Therefore, no crystals are formed in a sucrose 
solution cooked to 112°C. until the temperature drops below 90°C. 
Woodruff and van Gilder found that fondant cooked to 115°C. has an 
average water content of about 13 per cent. The higher the temperature 
to which the sirup is cooked, the less the percentage of water in the fondant. 
If fondant contains too small a proportion of water, it is dry and crumbly ; 
if too much, it is sirupy and runny. When the sirup is cooked to 109° to 
111°C. (Experiment 7B), the fondant contains a high percentage of 
moisture. Sirups cooked to this temperature give a fondant too fluid to 
knead or mold, unless it is beaten when hot. Fondant sirup for ordinary 
home use may be cooked from 113° to 115° C. The lower temperature 
gives a softer fondant for remelting and making candy like peppermints; 
the higher temperature gives a drier fondant for molding. It should be

64 SUGAR COOKERY 

remembered that evaporation is greater from a small quantity of fondant, 
while it is being stirred, than from a large quantity. On rainy or damp 
days, when the humidity is high, moisture may be absorbed from the air 
by the sirup, so that it is preferable to cook the sirup to the higher tem- 
perature. Cooking the sirup to a temperature above 116°C. gives a fondant 
that is too dry and crumbly. Jordan states that commercially the amount 
of moisture in fondant is controlled carefully and according to the use for 
which it is intended, as a difference of 1 per cent of moisture results in a 
fondant too soft to handle or too dry to knead. 

The growth of crystals in fondant. Freundlich states that "surface 
tension is also the cause of recrystallization, in which small crystals unite 
to larger ones. Probably this phenomenon is similar to the union of minute 
droplets to larger ones, when in direct contact, for it is unlikely that the 
formation of larger crystals could be due to the increased vapor pressure 
of the smaller ones bringing about a distillation ; the process takes place far 
too rapidly to allow of the latter explanation." Water in fondant is a 
saturated sucrose solution. The crystals are in contact with this saturated 
solution. Owing to the higher surface energy of small crystals, as dis- 
cussed in Chapter I, the smaller crystals dissolve, and the larger crystals 
increase in size. 

Crystals in fondant may grow in size during storage. Halliday and 
Noble have reported the growth of crystals in fondant stored for 17 days. 
Figs. 3 to 8 show crystals from fondant. Fig. 7 shows the growth of 
crystals in fondant after 40 days' storage. Compare these crystals with 
those shown in Fig. 3. 

The addition of egg white to fondant. Egg white may be added 
to fondant. Paine states that the clumping together of air particles into 
larger particles lessens the intensity of the white and that the addition 
of a small quantity of egg white to fondant prevents the aggregation of 
the air particles, thus aiding in keeping the fondant white. The beaten egg 
also incorporates additional air. 

The addition of beaten egg white to fondant also retards the rate of 
crystal growth during storage. Figs. 4, 6, and 8 show crystals from 
fondant to which egg white has been added. Since the egg white is ad- 
sorbed by the crystals, the effectiveness of the egg white in preventing 
crystal growth may partially depend upon how the egg white is distributed 
throughout the fondant. Swanson found that not much more than 6 per 
cent of beaten egg white could be added to the fondant, without the 
fondant becoming too fluid. She found 3 per cent of added egg white to 
be as effective as 6 in preventing growth of crystals during storage. 

The addition of dextrose, levulose, or invert sugar to fondant. 
Dextrose, levulose, or invert sirup may be added directly to sucrose solu- 
tions to aid in regulating the size of the crystals. Or, invert sugar may be 
formed during cooking of the sucrose sirup by adding citric, tartaric, or 
acetic acids. Often cream of tartar is used for inverting sucrose in fondant. 



COLOR OF FONDANT 65 

It is difficult to regulate conditions, such as the time of cooking, to obtain 
a definite percentage of invert sugar for sucrose is inverted more rapidly 
with higher temperatures and greater acidity. Hence, it is sometimes pref- 
erable to add a definite quantity of dextrose, levulose, or invert sugar. 
Woodruff and van Gilder found that cream of tartar inverted the sucrose 
more slowly than citric, tartaric, or hydrochloric acids at the same pH. 
Cream of tartar can be added in sufficient quantity to produce enough 
invert sugar to give small crystals and to add to the smoothness of the 
fondant. If added in too large a quantity, too much invert sugar is formed, 
so that the fondant is too fluid. The flavor of the fondant is quite acid 
when a large proportion of cream of tartar is used. 

The larger the quantity of dextrose or levulose added in making 
fondant the longer the time required to beat the sirup to bring about 
crystallization. With too large a proportion of these sugars the fondant 
is soft. When fluid centers of confections are desired, it is necessary to add 
substances that bring about inversion of the sucrose after the fondant is 
dipped in chocolate or treated in some way to give a firm outer coating. 

Woodruff and van Gilder state that sirups with concentrations of 43 per 
cent or more invert sugar would not crystallize; those containing 16 to 23 
per cent formed a semi-fluid mass of crystals; and those containing 6 to 15 
per cent gave a plastic, moldable product. With 11.1 per cent or more of 
invert sugar the crystals of maximum size measured 10 to 13.2 microns 
and the grain was exceedingly fine to tongue and roof of the mouth. 
Fondants containing 7 per cent reducing sugars of either kind (glucose or 
levulose) were of agreeably fine texture, with their largest crystals measur- 
ing 15 to 19 microns. Crystals in candies of observed coarse texture meas- 
ured 45 or more microns. Differences in crystal size of 6 to 10 microns, 
which was the difference of crystal measurements of fondants rated very 
fine and slightly coarse, could be detected by the tactile sense. 

Halliday and Noble have reported that the addition of corn sirup, 
which contains dextrose and dextrin, tends to prevent the growth of 
crystals during storage of fondant. They also found that fondant made 
with cream of tartar retarded crystal growth during storage. 

Color of fondant. Fondant crystallizing without stirring is not snowy 
white but more transparent. The snow-white appearance of the stirred 
fondant is due to the small air particles. When the water contains alkaline 
salts the fondant without cream of tartar added has a yellow or gray 
tinge ; that with cream of tartar or acids is white. 

Fondant made with hard water, />H 7.2 to 7.8, has a creamy tint. This 
may be caused by slight traces of flavones in the sugar, but it is probable 
that it is due to caramelization or some other cause. If, to some of the same 
sugar and water, a little cream of tartar is added, a snowy white fondant 
is always obtained. If, however, corn sirup is added to the sugar to make 
fondant with the above water a gray color develops. The color is so pro- 



66 SUGAR COOKERY 

nounced that the fondant is not attractive looking. If distilled water is 
used with the corn sirup and sucrose, the gray color does not develop. 

Ripening. When fondant stands 12 to 24 hours it seems more moist 
and is more plastic and kneads more easily than when it was first made. 
In the candy trade this is known as "ripening." Fondants that contain 
substances that cause slow hydrolysis of the sucrose become softer on 
account of the formation of invert sugar, but ''ripening" is an additional 
process and occurs in fondant containing only sucrose. Carrick suggests 
that the reason for this "ripening" is that the small crystals in the mass 
are dissolved, thus lettiqg the large crystals move more easily, and they are 
thus more plastic. 

Honey fondant. Candies made from pure honey, on account of their 
high levulose content and the moisture-absorbing property of honey, usually 
become very sticky in a few hours after they are made. Phillips reports the 
combination of honey, whole milk, and lactose sugar to make fondant. 
Stratton combined honey and lactose in fondant. Fondant usually contains 
some crystals of each of the sugars that enters into its composition, but in 
Stratton's combination the crystal phase was entirely lactose, the crystals 
being particularly minute. But the lactose crystals have a tendency to grow 
so that fondants smooth at first became somewhat grainy. It was found 
that the honey fondant would absorb a relatively high percentage of whole 
milk by mechanical mixing, and that this milk tended to prevent the growth 
of the lactose crystals. It was also found that the honey has an unusual 
preservative action, for the milk in the mixture remained sweet as long as 
the candy was kept. 

Fudge 

The factors that control the size of the crystals in fondant making 
also determine the size of the crystals formed in fudge. Fudge is often 
made of brown sugar. Brown sugar contains a higher percentage of invert 
sugar than granulated sugar. Thus it crystallizes less readily than granu- 
lated sugar. 

Fudge also ripens with storage and if placed in a container with a 
tight-fitting lid becomes much softer and more velvety after 24 hours' 
storage. 

In substituting cocoa for the chocolate in fudge, Reese found that the 
quantity of cocoa was a matter of individual preference, although 3 to 3^ 
tablespoons to each cup of sugar was preferred by the majority of judges. 
But, if other conditions were standardized, the final temperature to which 
the sirup was cooked depended upon the proportion of cocoa used. Cocoa 
contains considerable dextrin. It is probably the presence of this ingredient 
that affects the consistency of the sirup so that with increasing amounts of 
cocoa the temperature to which the sirup is cooked should be lower. For 
a sirup cooled to 40°C. and requiring about 12 to 15 minutes to beat to 



THE AMOUNT OF MILK IN CARAMELS 67 

bring about crystallization, the fudge containing 1 tablespoon of cocoa is 
cooked to 112.5° or 113°C. For each additional tablespoon of cocoa the 
temperature to which the sirup is cooked can be lowered one-half degree. 
These conditions hold for the recipe given in the laboratory outline. With 
larger proportions of butter, the temperature to which the sirup is cooked 
should be elevated. 

Caramels 

Caramels, taiiy, and brittles are types of candy that are firm but not 
crystallized. To prevent crystallization larger quantities of dextrose, levu- 
lose, corn sirup, or other substances are added than when making fondant 
or fudge. If these substances are not added directly, then larger quantities 
of substances that produce inversion of sucrose are used, thus giving a 
higher percentage of invert sugar. 

Corn sirup and molasses are the materials most commonly used in 
caramels to prevent crystallization. The temperature to which caramels are 
cooked depends upon the ingredients used to prevent crystallization and 
their proportion. With increasing amounts of corn sirup, because of its 
dextrin content, the temperature to which the caramels are cooked is 
lowered. But with molasses or honey the temperature to which the caramels 
are cooked is much higher than when corn sirup is used. In the recipe given 
in the experimental outline with 1 cup of corn sirup to 2 cups of sucrose, 
a temperature of 119° to 120°C. produces the degree of firmness liked by 
most people. If the corn sirup is increased to 2 cups and the sucrose re- 
duced to 1 cup the same firmness is produced by cooking to a lower tem- 
perature or 116° to 117°C. If dextrose, honey, or molasses is substituted 
for the corn sirup, the temperature to which the sirup must be cooked to 
give the same firmness is above 120°, sometimes as much as 126°C. or 
higher, the temperature depending on the type of molasses or the pro- 
portion used. 

Sugar reactions with proteins. Ramsay, Tracy, and Ruehe found 
that when milk, albumin, or casein is heated with lactose or dextrose a 
brown discoloration occurs. As the temperature is raised dextrose and casein 
become so firmly attached to each other in a protein-sugar complex that no 
amount of washing will remove the sugar. 

The amount of milk in caramels. A large quantity of milk in cara- 
mels develops a flavor that can be obtained in no other way. Slow cooking 
develops more of the brown color and flavor than rapid cooking. The 
color comes from lactose-protein and dextrose-protein compounds and the 
caramelization of the lactose with high temperatures and long cooking. 
If all the milk is added when cooking is first started the milk may curdle. 
If most of the milk is added slowly after the sirup is thick it very seldom 
curdles. In using large quantities of milk in caramels the protein of the milk 
will tend to prevent crystallization. 



68 SUGAR COOKERY 

Large quantities of fat increase the richness of caramels. 

Caramels are stirred or handled as little as possible after the sirup 
stops boiling until they are cool. After the boiling is stopped they soon 
reach the saturation point, which for caramels is above 100°C., and 
stirring the sirup or scraping the pan tends to produce crystals. 

Taffy 

Taffies or pulled candies have vinegar, lemon juice, or cream of tartar 
added during cooking. These substances cause inversion of the sucrose, 
which prevents crystallization. Dextrose, corn sirup, or molasses may be 
added to the sucrose to prevent crystallization. Pulled taffies become white, 
or if made with molasses become much lighter in color, on account of the 
air bubbles incorporated during pulling. 

The cooking temperatures of pulled candies vary according to the 
ingredients and their proportion used, but follow the same general rules 
as for caramels. Those containing large quantities of corn sirup are cooked 
to lower temperatures. Taffies are firmer than caramels and are there- 
fore cooked to higher temperatures. 

Brittles 

Brittles are much harder than caramels or taffies and are cooked to 
high temperatures. At the temperatures to which they are cooked carameli- 
zation of the sugar may take place, and this as well as added substances 
tends to prevent crystallization. If caramelization is very extensive, a 
number of decomposition products of sugar may develop, among which 
are some acid substances. The greater the amount of caramelization the 
stronger the flavor developed. Soda is often added to brittles. It not only 
neutralizes the acidity developed and lessens the bitter flavor but owing to 
gas formed gives a porous texture to the brittle.

SUGAR COOKERY 

Laboratory Outline 

Keep a record of the experiments performed in a permanent note book. 
The experiments should be written up under the following headings. 
The object of the experiment, what happens, the results, and most impor- 
tant, the conclusion drawn or the application of the results in preparation 
of food. Suggestive headings for record of what happens are given under 
most of the experiments. 

Experiment 1. 

To determine the relative solubility of the various sugars. 

Measure 20 cc. of water for each sugar to be used. Place in a Pyrex cup or 
a glass. Take the temperature of the water. Weigh the following amounts 
of sugar. 



LABORATORY OUTLINE 



71 



Sucrose 60 grams 

Levulose 70 grams 

Dextrose 20 grams 

Maltose 20 grams 

Lactose 5 grams 

Add a small portion of the sucrose to one of the containers of water. Stir 
until all is dissolved. Add another portion of sucrose and continue until you 
have as much of the sucrose in solution as can be dissolved. Take the tem- 
perature of the solution w^hile the sugar is dissolving. The stirring should be 
continued at intervals for 1 hour. Weigh the sucrose that is left and subtract 
the amount from 60 grams to obtain the amount dissolved. Your results v^^ill 
be only approximate for solubility should be determined in flasks to prevent 
evaporation. However, the results that you obtain will show the compara- 
tive solubility of the different sugars. If any undissolved sucrose remains 
after stirring for some time, set the container in warm water and stir until 
all the sucrose is dissolved. Put the container away in the laboratory and look 
at it occasionally to watch the growth of crystals. Compare the crystals formed 
with those of other sugars. 

Repeat the above directions for each sugar. For the less soluble dextrose and 
maltose add smaller portions when dissolving the sugars. Lactose has the least 
solubility of the above sugars and should be added in very small portions.

Experiment 2. 

To determine the boiling point of water at the elevation above sea level at 
which you live. 

Place 1 pint of water in a sauce pan. Heat slowly. Notice the temperature 
at which bubbles begin to form on the sides and bottom of the pan. Of what 
are these bubbles formed? What becomes of them? At what temperature do the 
vapor bubbles begin to form? Do the first ones reach the surface of the water? 
At what temperature does the water boil? Are you at sea level or above it? 
What is the boiling point of water at sea level? Observe the surface of the 
liquid and the size of the bubbles. Heat the water so that the bubbles form 
rapidly. Is the temperature the same as when the bubbles form slowly? How 
do the surface of the water and the size of the bubbles compare with those 
of the slow-bubbling liquid? Does the temperature rise? Explain. 

Compare the temperatures registered by the thermometer when held in the 
water so that the thermometer bulb does not touch the bottom of the pan and 
when it touches it. Compare the temperatures registered when the bulb of

the thermometer is only partially Immersed and when it Is immersed so that 
there Is ^ to 1 Inch of water above the bulb. How should you apply these 
results to cooking sirups to a definite temperature In class results? Is the tem- 
perature the same when the thermometer bulb touches the bottom at the 
center and at the sides of the pan? (This may or may not vary according to 
the type of gas burner or the electric unit used.)

Experiment 3. 

To determine the effect on the boiling point of water when a soluble sub- 
stance is added. 

To 1 cup of water add a scant Y\ cup of salt. Heat to the boiling point. 
Note the temperature. Continue boiling. Does the temperature change? Con- 
tinue boiling until the temperature remains constant. What other change 
occurs? What Is the effect on the boiling point when salt is added to water? 
Results and conclusions. 



Experiment 4. 

To determine the boiling temperature of sugar sirups corresponding to the 
"cold-water tests" used in candy making. 

A. Sucrose sirup. 

Dissolve 1 cup of sucrose (granulated sugar) In Yz cup of water. (The 
proportion of sugar and water used may need to be Increased. The quantity 
of sirup should be sufficient to cover the thermometer stem to a depth of Yz 
Inch above the bulb. The amount of sugar needed depends upon the size of the 
pan and the length of the thermometer bulb.) Bring the solution to boiling. 
Note rise in temperature with constant boiling. Explain. Why can a higher 
temperature be obtained with the sugar solution than with the salt solution? 

Cook the sirup In sauce pans of the same size and shape. At the tempera- 
tures given below remove portions of the sirup. Remove the pan from the stove 
when making each test. Drop a tablespoon of the sirup in cold water. Note 
the consistency. Is it easily molded? Does It ring when hit against the side of 
the container? When do threads or hairs begin to form when a portion of the 
sirup Is allowed to flow from a spoon? How do the character and length of the 
threads vary at different temperatures? Keep the series of tests on your work 
tray for comparison with the following experiments and with your neighbors' 
results. Note the texture at room temperature. Is it soft, firm, or brittle? 
Put a portion In your mouth. Does It dissolve rapidly on the tongue? To 
what stage in candy cookery does each of the temperatures given correspond?

Directions. Combine the ingredients. Cover the pan for the first few minutes 
of boiling. Why? Cook to the desired temperature and pour quickly into a 
buttered plate. Do not scrape the cooking pan with the spoon. Cool the sirup 
until it can be handled without burning the hands. Pull until light in color. 

1. Cook to 128°C. 

2. To the above recipe add 1 teaspoon of cream of tartar. 

3. To the recipe add ^ cup (81 grams) of corn sirup. Should the tempera- 
ture to which the sirup is cooked be higher or lower than 128°C. ? 

4. To the recipe add Yi cup (162 grams) of corn sirup. Should the tempera- 
ture to which the sirup is cooked be higher or lower than 128°C.? 

5. To the recipe add 1^^ tablespoons of vinegar. 

6. To the recipe add Yi cup (162 grams) of sorghum or molasses. To what 
temperature should the sirup be cooked? 

7. To the recipe add 3^ cup of honey (162 grams). To what temperature 
should the sirup be cooked? 

Is 128°C. always the best temperature for pulled candies? Look up recipes 
in cook books. What do they contain besides sugar and a liquid? What is the 
purpose of the added substances? When the candy has hardened examine a 
portion under the microscope. Is the candy crystallized? Save portions of all 
candies for several days. Do any crystallize after long standing? Compare 
the behavior of this candy with that of sulfur in the crystalline and the amor- 
phous condition. 

Enumerate all the factors which may cause the relationship between the 
cold-water test and a given boiling temperature to vary. What would the re- 
sults be if 1 or 2 tablespoons of lemon juice were added to the pulled candy 
recipe?

Prepare one-quarter or one-half of the recipe. 

1. Combine all the ingredients and stir while cooking to prevent scorching. 
Cook to 121°C, and turn into a buttered pan very quickly, taking care not to 
scrape the contents of the cooking pan with the spoon while pouring the cara- 
mel mixture. Do not try to drain the last of the contents of the cooking pan 
into the cooling pan. When cool enough, cut into squares with scissors or 
a knife. 

2. Combine all the ingredients but reserve two-thirds of the milk. Cook 
until quite thick, about 119°C. ; then add half of the remaining milk so slowly 
that the mixture does not stop boiling. Cook until the sirup becomes thick 
again; then add the remainder of the milk slowly. When the temperature 
reaches 121°C., remove from the fire and follow directions under 1. 

3. Repeat 2, but cook to 119°C. 

4. Repeat 2, but use 1^ cups of sugar and 1^^ cups of corn sirup. Cook 
to 118°C. 

5. Follow directions under 2 for combining but use 1 cup of sugar and 2 
cups of corn sirup. Cook to 116° to 117°C. 

6. Substitute 1 cup of sorghum for the corn sirup. To what temperature 
does it need to be cooked to have the cold-water test the same firmness as in 
3 ? Follow directions under 2 for combining and cook so that the caramels will 
be as firm as those under 3. 

7. Repeat 6 but substitute strained honey for the sorghum. 

8. Substitute 2 cups of cream for the 3 cups of milk. Omit the butter. Follow 
directions under 2 for combining. Add j4, teaspoon salt. Cook to 119°C. 

9. Reduce the milk to 2 cups and increase the butter to ^ cup. Follow 
directions under 2. Cook to 119°C. 

10. Substitute ^ cup of evaporated milk for the 3 cups of milk. Follow 
directions under 1. Cook to 119°C. 

11. Substitute 1 cup of water for the 3 cups of milk. Follow directions 
under 1 for combining. Cook to 119°C. 

12. Add 2 squares of chocolate (56 grams) to the recipe. Follow directions 
under 2 for combining. Cook to 119°C. 

Cold-water test for caramels. The caramels are cooked sufficiently when a 
portion of the sirup dropped in cold water is as firm as that wished in the 
finished caramel. If small quantities of ingredients are used in making cara- 
mels, it is difficult to use a thermometer for the stirring of the viscous sirup 
pulls and piles it up against the thermometer. The viscosity of the solution 
also seems to have a tendency to hold in for a few seconds some of the steam

formed. Thus it is difficult to secure accurate readings, the temperature 
fluctuating considerably. 

Wrap portions of each of the caramels and store until the following class 
period. Do any of them crystallize? Do the larger proportions of corn sirup 
keep better? Do any with the small proportions of corn sirup crystallize? When 
the proportions of the ingredients of the recipe are changed is the temperature 
as indicated by the thermometer or the cold-water test a better indication that 
the sirup is the right concentration for removing from the fire? Can smaller 
quantities of milk be used?

Fondant 



Experiment 7. 

To determine the factors which influence the rate of crystallization of 
sucrose and the size of the crystals. 

Dissolve 1 cup of sucrose (200 grams) in Yz cup of water. (Increase or 
decrease these proportions if necessary.) Use pans of the same size and shape. 
Be sure the pans are smooth. Because the sirup splashed on the sides dries 
less readily from the heat of the burner, a pan with a straight side or one that 
curves in at the top is preferable to one that slopes outward at the top. 
If desired the sirup may be poured into plates for cooling instead of following 
directions under the outline. If this is done the containers into which it is 
poured should be smooth and the same size and all should be cooled in the 
same manner. Great care should also be taken to pour the sirup rapidly and 
not to scrape the pan. 

If the amount of water in the fondant is to be determined, the pan and 
the stirring spoon should be weighed before the fondant is cooked. The weight 
of the fondant, before removal from the cooking pan, minus the weight of the 
sugar used gives the amount of water in the fondant. 

A. Temperature at which the sirup is beaten. 

1. Cook the sirup covered for 4 or 5 minutes. Remove the lid and continue 
boiling until sufficiently concentrated. (Cook to 113°C. if the day is clear, and 
to 114° or 115°C. if rainy or if the humidity is high.) 

Boil the sirup without stirring or if stirred follow the caution given in the 
text. Cool the sirup in the sauce pan to 40°C. then beat until stiff. If a wooden 
spoon is used for beating it is less likely to form blisters on the hands than a 
metal spoon. After crystallization has occurred, knead until soft. Care should 
be taken that no crystals form on the side of the pan during cooking or cool- 
ing, for they will seed the mass and the time for beating will thus be shorter 
for A2 and A3 than would normally be required and the crystals larger. 

2. Repeat 1 but cool only to 70° C. before beating.

3. Repeat 1 but beat the sirup as soon as it is removed from the stove. 

Examine portions of each fondant under the microscope. Wrap portions from 
each experiment in oiled paper and put away in a tightly covered container until 
the next lesson. What is the effect of 24 hours' storage on the firmness and 
the texture of the fondant? Why do the directions under Al state not to stir 
the sirup while cooking?

6. Repeat Al, adding 4 tablespoons of corn sirup to the recipe. 

7. Melt 4 tablespoons of sugar. Stir while melting. Do not have the heat 
intense enough to decidedly darken or scorch the sirup. When it is all melted 
and a golden brown color, add boiling water and stir until dissolved. Then

If C4, 6, and 7 do not crystallize let them stand until the next lesson. 
What would be the effect on the rate of crystallization if these candies were 
allowed to cook to a higher temperature? If they were beaten hot? What is 
the efEect on the rate of crystallization of sugar when considerable hydrolysis 
has occurred, as in C3 and C4, or when a large amount of corn sirup or 
caramelized sugar has been added, as in C6 or C7? 

Test portions of Al and C2 with Fehling's solution. 

What is the action of cream of tartar when added to fondant? What 
would be the result if vinegar or lemon juice were substituted for the cream 
of tartar in C2 and C3 ? Is the fondant obtained in C2 and C3 superior to 
that obtained in Al ? Compare the keeping qualities of the different fondants 
by putting some of each away in a covered container and observing at 
different periods. Examine portions of each under the microscope. 

Experiment 8. 

To determine the comparative ease of crystallization of different sugars 
in making fondant. 

A. Repeat Experiment 7A, but substitute dextrose for the sucrose. 

B. Repeat Experiment 7A, substituting levulose for the sucrose. If levu- 
lose cannot be obtained use honey, which contains a high percentage of 
levulose. Or use the liquid portion of crystallized honey, which is nearly 
pure levulose. 

If any under A or B do not crystallize, recook them. See if they will 
crystallize after being cooked to a higher temperature.

Experiment 9. 

To determine the factors influencing the consistency and flavor of fudge. 
Recipe : 

Sugar 1 cup 200 grams 

Milk yi cup 122 grams 

Butter 1 tablespoon 14 grams 

Chocolate ^ square 21 grams 

Combine sugar, chocolate, butter, and liquid. Stir until the sugar is dis- 
solved and the chocolate is melted. Cook to the temperatures given below. 
If the mixture is poured into another container for cooling, be sure the con- 
tainer is smooth. If it is poured into a platter or similar utensil, cooling will 
be more rapid and even more so if the platter is set on a cake rack or is ele- 
vated. Use containers of the same size and the same method for all the 
experiments. Cool to 40°C. and beat until the mass begins to crystallize. 
Turn quickly into a buttered pan or knead as desired. Select thermometers 
that have the same boiling point. The recipe may need to be doubled or 
increased so that the quantity of material in the cooking pan will be great 
enough to cover the bulb of the thermometer in order to obtain an accurate 
reading. How should the thermometers be held in the sirup to determine

The main principles of sugar cookery are covered, and some are repeated, 
in the preceding experiments. Some frostings and some candies have added 
substances, like egg white, which retard crystallization. The principles for 
cooking are the same as those used in cooking and preparing the candies of 
the preceding experiments. However, to have frostings a consistency to 
spread and cut well, variations in temperature of cooking from that of 
candy may be necessary.

4. Prepare boiled icing by pouring the cooked sirup over beaten egg white. 
Prepare an outline for making this type of icing, giving variations in tem- 
perature to which the sirup is cooked before adding to the egg white and the

white. Vary the amount of sugar used for different proportions of egg. Consult 
any reference that you wish for making your outline and use the results of any 
of the sugar experiments.

y^ cup of water. Cook to 119° or 120°C. and pour slowly into 1 stiffly beaten 
egg white, beating as the sirup is added. For divinity beat until pieces dropped 
on wax paper will hold their shape. 



CHAPTER III 

FREEZING 

A pure liquid has a definite freezing point. In freezing the fluid 
changes from a liquid to a solid state. Water freezes at 0°C. or 32°F. 
Just as sugar solutions in cooling may give supersaturated solutions before 
crystallization starts, so water may be supercooled before it freezes. 
Furthermore, the conditions for supersaturation and supercooling are 
similar. For supersaturation the solution must not be agitated and no 
crystals must be added. If a test tube of water containing a thermometer 
is immersed in a mixture of ice and salt, the temperature of the water will 
drop to — 4°C. or lower. If the slightest movement is made or if a small 
crystal of ice is added the water will crystallize quickly, and the tempera- 
ture rises to 0°C., for water in freezing gives off heat. A gram of water 
changing from 0° to ice at 0°C. gives off 79.9 (or about 80) calories of 
heat. When the water has been supercooled, this heat of solidification 
elevates the temperature of the ice and liquid to 0°C. The heat of crystal- 
lization may be absorbed by the liquid or given off to the surroundings if 
the freezing liquid is not insulated. 

The Freezing Point of a Liquid 

The freezing point of a liquid cannot be defined as the temperature at 
which the liquid becomes a solid, for supercooled liquids are cooled below 
the freezing point. The freezing point and the melting point are identical, 
so that the freezing point may be defined as the temperature at which the 
solid melts. The freezing point of a liquid may also be defined as the 
temperature at which the solid and liquid are in equilibrium. Here equilib- 
rium means the temperature at which any proportion of solid and liquid 
can exist without change, that is, no solid melts and no liquid freezes. 
For water, this temperature is 0°C. Of course, equilibrium can exist for 
a long period of time only if the solid and liquid are completely insulated 
or if the temperature of the surroundings is at the freezing point of the 
liquid. If the temperature of the surroundings changes slightly above 0°C. 
so that heat is absorbed, some of the solid melts. If the temperature of 
the surroundings is below 0°C., so that heat is withdrawn from the mix- 
ture, the liquid freezes. After all the liquid is frozen, the temperature 
of the ice may drop below 0°C., just as the temperature of the ground or 
a stone may assume the temperature of the surroundings. 

83 



84 FREEZING 

If ice and water that are not at the same temperature are mixed, they 
are not in equilibrium, since ice and water are in equilibrium only at the 
freezing point or 0°C. If the temperature of the ice is 0°C. and the 
temperature of the water is 20°C. some of the ice melts. In melting, each 
gram of ice absorbs 80 calories of heat, and the temperature of the water 
is lowered. If sufficient ice is added to the water, and the temperature 
of the surroundings does not influence the mixture, ice melts until the 
temperature of the water reaches 0°C. and equilibrium is established. If 
the quantity of ice added to the water is not sufficient to lower the 
temperature of the water to 0°C., the temperature of the water is lowered 
as long as the ice melts and provided the surroundings do not influence 
the temperature. After the ice is all melted the temperature of the water 
cannot be lowered except from the surroundings. 

Lowering of the Freezing Point 

When a soluble substance is dissolved in a liquid the freezing point is 
lower than that of the pure solvent. A gram-molecular weight (mole) 
of a non-ionized substance in a liter of water lowers the freezing point 
1.86°C. The lowering of the freezing point can be continued as long as 
the substance is soluble. If no more than 3 moles of a non-ionized substance 
are soluble in a liter of water, the freezing point cannot be depressed 
below — 5.58°C. Substances that are not very soluble do not affect the 
freezing point particularly, because such a small portion of a mole of the 
substance is dissolved. Thus substances in suspension, such as fat in milk 
or cream, do not affect the freezing point of an ice-cream mix in the same 
way that sugar does, for the fat is not soluble. 

Ionized substances and the freezing point. Sugar does not ionize 
or dissociate in the solution to an extent great enough to influence the 
freezing point. Salt belongs to the groups of electrolytes* which dissociate 
into ions in the solution. The amount of ionization depends upon the 
concentration of the solution : the less concentrated the solution the greater 
the dissociation. In a very dilute solution, complete dissociation into ions 
may occur. If 58 grams of salt or sodium chloride in 1 liter of water 
are completely ionized into sodium and chlorine ions, there will be 1 mole 
of sodium ions and 1 of chlorine ions. Thus the two lower the freezing 
point (2 X 1.86) or — 3.72°C. The molecular weight of sucrose is 342 
grams, that of levulose is 180, and that of dextrose is 180 grams. None of 
the sugars ionize to an extent that affects the freezing point. Compare 
the freezing points, if ^ cup, or 150' grams, each, of sucrose, levulose, or 
dextrose is added to a quart of cream. 

Calcium chloride ionizes into 3 ions. Therefore, a mole of calcium 
chloride depresses the freezing point more than a mole of sodium chloride. 



FREEZING MIXTURES 85 

The calcium chloride is also more soluble than sodium chloride, so that a 
greater number of moles can be dissolved in a liter of water. 

CaCla < ^ Ca++2C1- 

The Freezing Point of Ice Cream and Ices 

Milk, which contains sugar and other dissolved substances, has a lower 
freezing point than water. When sugar is dissolved in water and some 
fruit juice added to make a sherbet or ice the freezing point of the sherbet 
mixture is about — 4° to — 5°C., depending upon the proportion of sugar 
added. Ice cream containing about % cup of sugar to a quart of cream 
freezes between — 1° and — 2°C., or about 29°F. Ice cream usually con- 
tains a smaller percentage of sugar than ices or sherbets. 

Freezing Mixtures 

When a crystalline substance is added to a liquid its freezing point is 
lowered. However, as a solution freezes it separates into crystals of the 
solvent and crystals of the dissolved substance. 

Suppose 10 grams of salt are added to 90 grams of water to give a 10 
per cent salt solution. The salt dissolves and the temperature of the solu- 
tion is lowered. The freezing point of salt solutions may be shown in 
the diagram by the line AB. The temperature is represented vertically 
and the percentage of salt in the solution is represented horizontally. 

The freezing point of water is 0°C. This is represented on the line 
AB of Fig. 13, at A. The freezing point of a 10 per cent salt solution 
is about — 5°C. This is shown at point X, where the freezing-point line 
AB cuts the line indicating a 10 per cent salt solution. If the salt solution 
is cooled to — 5°C. some of the water freezes. This leaves a greater con- 
centration of salt than 10 per cent in the rest of the solution. Thus the 
freezing point of the rest of the solution is lowered. If cooling of the 
solution is continued, ice will continue to form, and the remaining salt 
solution will become more concentrated and its freezing point lower. The 
lowering of the freezing point can be continued until the line AB cuts 
the line BC. The point B represents the limit of the solubility of the 
salt at a temperature of — 22°C. Below this temperature the salt and 
water separate, both crystallizing. This is called the cryohydric point. 
Both the ice and salt may be cooled to lower temperatures than — 22°C. 
after they are in solid form. 

If salt is mixed with water a saturated solution is obtained when the 
solution contains 35.6 grams of salt per 100 grams of solution at 0°C. 
If this solution is cooled below 0°C. the solubility of the salt is not so 
great at the lower temperatures. This is shown on the line CB. A little 
below 0°C. salt combines with 2 molecules of water. Thus the slope of the 



86 



FREEZING 



curve for solubility of salt changes below 0°C., and the salt is found in 
solution as the dihydrate. If a saturated salt solution is cooled below 0°C. 
the excess salt beyond saturation point is precipitated from solution. This 
will continue until the cryohydric point is reached. 

Salt is often added to ice for a freezing mixture. When salt is added 
to water and ice at 0°C. they are not in equilibrium, even if the sur- 
roundings are at 0°C., for the addition of salt lowers the freezing point 
of the solution. Since they are not in equilibrium the ice melts and the salt 
dissolves in the water. There is always a film of water on the surface 
of the ice. As the salt dissolves in this small amount of water it absorbs 
heat. This absorbed heat is taken from the brine or from the surround-

ings. If the heat is taken from the brine the temperature of the brine 
is lowered. 

When salt is added to ice, one of three things may happen, depending 
upon the proportion of ice and salt, and the surrounding temperature or 
insulation. All the salt may be dissolved. When this happens the melting 
of the ice lessens the concentration of the salt solution and the tempera- 
ture is not lowered beyond the point obtained when the solution con- 
tains the highest concentration of salt. All the ice may melt. When the ice 
is melted the temperature cannot be lowered to a greater extent, for 
there is no more ice to melt to absorb the heat. The cryohydric point may 
be reached. At this point the solution becomes solid and separates into 
ice and salt. 

Ice-cream freezers. An ice-and-salt mixture is used to lower the 
temperature of other substances. An ice-cream freezer is a utensil made 
to freeze a substance placed in a center metal container. Outside this metal 



TWO PROCEDURES USED IN FREEZING 87 

container there is a space in which the cooling medium is placed. The outer 
wall of the ice-cream freezer is often of wood, which is a poor conductor 
of heat. Since it conducts heat slowly it partially insulates the ice and 
salt from the surrounding air. The freezing mixture absorbs heat. In 
doing this it lowers the temperature of the brine and removes heat from 
the contents of the center can. In order to freeze the contents of the can 
the temperature of the brine formed must be lower than the freezing point 
of the mixture to be frozen. 

To freeze the contents of the ice-cream can, considerable heat must be 
removed from it. As a result, a corresponding amount of ice must melt to 
absorb the heat. Therefore, the contents of the can do not begin to freeze 
until considerable brine has formed. Conduction of heat is more rapid by 
water than by air. Before the brine forms and replaces the air spaces around 
the ice, conduction of heat from the can is slow. After all the salt is dis- 
solved or all the ice is melted, the temperature of the brine cannot be 
lowered, unless the temperature of the surrounding air is lower than the 
temperature of the brine. In ice-cream making the temperature of the sur- 
roundings is usually much higher than the temperature of the brine. 
When the quantity of ice left in the freezer is small the temperature of the 
surrounding air may heat the brine more than the melting of the small 
amount of ice cools it. Before this stage is reached the freezer needs fresh 
ice and salt packed around it. 

The lowest temperature obtainable for a brine from a salt and ice mix- 
ture is about — 22°C. (Walker reports —21° and Bigelow — 22.4°C.) 
This temperature is called the cryohydric point. If calcium chloride is 
used with ice the lowest temperature obtainable is — 55 °C. 

At the cryohydric point 29 parts of salt are soluble in 71 parts of water. 
No more salt can be dissolved at this temperature. This proportion of salt 
to ice is about 1 to 3 and is often used in freezing mixtures. 

Ice in the refrigerator is probably about 0°C., but ice from out of 
doors on a cold winter day may have a temperature far below 0°C. When 
ice at a very low temperature is used for freezing, a brine will form more 
quickly and freezing start sooner if water is poured over the ice and salt. 

Proportion of Ice and Salt for Freezing and Packing 

Rate at which the temperature is lowered. The rate at which the 
temperature of the brine and thus also that of the mix to be frozen is 
lowered depends on the proportion of ice and salt, and on the fineness 
of division of the ice and salt. Small pieces of ice provide greater surface 
and thus melt faster than large pieces. Fine salt dissolves more quickly than 
coarse salt, but a fine table salt is likely to lump. Crushed rock salt is good 
to use. 

Two procedures are used in freezing. The smooth, velvety texture 
of ice cream and ices depends on several factors. One important factor is 



88 FREEZING 

the size of the crystals formed. The proportion of ingredients, their treat- 
ment, and the incorporation of air bubbles into the mixture while it is 
freezing are also important. Small crystals may be obtained by the quick- 
freezing method. A very low temperature is used, the mass being frozen 
so rapidly that many nuclei are formed and there is little crystal growth 
because of the short time. This process is easier to use commercially than 
in the home, because of the very low temperature employed for freezing. 
Judging from reports in the ice-cream trade journals, it is successful in 
some instances and not in others. 

The other procedure is to freeze at a slower rate, depending on agita- 
tion to form many nuclei. Air is incorporated in the mix in both processes. 
A temperature of — 8° to — 10°C. is sufficiently low to freeze most ice 
creams, sherbets, and ices. For home freezing, 1 part of salt to 8 of ice 
is a good proportion. Commercially, 1 part of salt to 12 of ice is often 
used. Washburn states that a proportion of 1 part of salt to 40 parts of ice 
will freeze if given ample time. The air globules are retained in the mixture 
better after it has nearly reached the freezing point. The air is beaten 
in by the dasher paddles. In freezing very rapidly there is not time to 
incorporate as much air as when the mix is frozen at a somewhat slower 
rate. 

Packing the freezer. Commercially most ice cream is now held in 
mechanically operated freezing units or rooms, although the same propor- 
tions of ice and salt may be used for packing that are used for freezing. 
For home-made ice cream the same proportion of ice and salt may be used 
as for home freezing, or about 1 of salt to 8 of ice. In packing, the ice 
should be pressed down tight in the can. This will force the surplus water 
out of the opening in the container. If the water is drained off it only takes 
a longer time for the brine to form again, and cooling is slower. A little salt 
should be added to the ice left in the freezer before the new ice is added. 
For home-made ice cream that is hot to stand very long before serving, a 
larger quantity of salt may be used to advantage. This will cause the 
temperature to drop quickly and hardening of the cream will take place 
more rapidly. 

The ice and salt may be mixed together before putting in the freezer, 
but a better way of packing is to fill the freezer half full of ice, then 
add a layer of salt. The ice and salt are then added in alternate layers until 
the top is reached. The water from the melting ice w^ashes the salt towards 
the bottom of the freezer, and once it reaches the bottom it is of small 
use for cooling purposes. Therefore, it is preferable to pack the freezer 
with the salt towards the top. 

Mousse. For packing home-made mousse, the proportion of salt to 
ice must be large, 1 to 3 or even 1 to 2. Whipped cream which has air 
beaten into it is added to a mousse. The mousse is molded and often is not 
stirred while freezing, although it may be stirred very slowly. Heat or 
cold penetrates more slowly to the center of a mixture that is not stirred. 



FAT 89 

In addition, the air and the high fat content of the whipped cream are 
poor conductors of heat and cold. Thus a mousse requires a low tempera- 
ture and long time to cool. The ice and salt may need to be repacked 
unless set where the air is cold. 

The Composition of Ice Cream 

A simple home-made ice cream may be made with cream, sugar, and 
flavoring. Flavoring is added to increase the palatability. The flavoring may 
be extracts, fruit, or nuts. Sometimes egg is added to home-made ice cream. 
Cream containing 17 to 20 per cent butter fat, or if not homogenized, 
22 per cent fat, gives a good home-made ice cream. Washburn states that 
the weight of sugar added may be one-sixth of the weight of the cream. 
Three-fourths of a cup of sugar to a quart of cream gives about this 
proportion, and this produces an average sweetness. The serum solids 
usually average about 6 per cent in home-made ice cream. 

Sommer states that a good commercial ice cream is obtained with the 
following proportions: 



Fat 


12.5% 


Serum solids 


10.0 


Sugar 


16.0 


Gelatin 


0.25 to 0.50 


Egg yolk solids 


0.50 



Total solids 39 . 25 to 39 . 50% 

Sommer also states that a richer ice cream has not proved generally 
successful because of the higher cost, but is preferred by many consumers. 
In the richer cream the fat is increased to 16 per cent and the serum solids 
reduced to 8 per cent. Although Sommer recommends the egg yolk solids, 
many manufacturers omit them. Gelatin, called a binder, is used to prevent 
coarse crystallization. Commercial ice cream must have condensed-milk or 
dry-milk products added to raise the serum solids to 8 or 10 per cent. 

The milk solids include the butter fat, the milk proteins, the milk sugar, 
and the ash; serum solids exclude the fat; total solids of ice cream include 
the milk solids and the added sugar. The total solids vary, but Sommer 
states they should not exceed 41 per cent. Each of the ingredients of the 
milk and also the added sugar has an effect on the body and the texture 
of the ice cream. The ingredients likewise affect the flavor. 

The Flavor of the Ice Cream 

Fat. The flavor of the ice cream is influenced by the ingredients that 
go into it. They should be free of foreign odors and flavors. Ambrose states 
that "increase in butter fat gives the richness of flavor that can be ob- 
tained in no other way." 



90 FREEZING 

Williams and Campbell conducted experiments in ice-cream making in 
which the fat content was varied: creams were made with 12, 15, and 
18 per cent fat, the other constituents remaining the same, and the method 
of making being kept uniform in each experiment. Purchasers were al- 
lowed to sample the three ice creams on the first day and on the following 
day could purchase their choice. The records showed that 80 per cent 
of the purchasers favored the ice cream containing 18 per cent fat, 10.4 
per cent favored the ice cream containing 15 per cent fat, and 7.6 per cent 
of the purchasers favored the ice cream containing 12 per cent fat. 

Salt. Salt may be added to ice cream, and for some persons the flavor is 
thereby improved. It is so easy to add too much that it is often better to 
omit it. A good proportion to use is about 3^ teaspoon of salt per gallon 
of mixture. 

Acidity. Acidity of the cream affects the flavor. The acidity of milk 
and cream increases with age. An acidity of 0.30 per cent produces an 
apparent sour taste; that usually preferred for ice cream is from 0.16 to 
0.20 per cent. 

Sugar. Williams and Campbell in experiments with ice cream, con- 
ducted like those just referred to with the fat, but in which the percentage 
of sugar varied, found that 61.4, 28.4, and 10.2 per cent of the purchasers 
showed a preference for the 19, 16, and 13 per cent sugar, respectively. 
This gives a total of 90 per cent favoring the ice cream with 16 or more 
per cent of sugar. 

Serum solids not fat. Similar experiments with serum solids not fat 
showed that 55.6, 25, and 18.6 per cent of the purchasers favored the ice 
cream containing 12, 9, and 6 per cent of serum solids, respectively. 

In regard to gelatin, 63.2, 13.8, and 23 per cent of the purchasers 
favored the ice cream containing 1, 0.5, and per cent of gelatin, respec- 
tively. 

Fisher states that the serum solids do not affect the flavor until a content 
of 12 per cent and beyond is reached. To obtain this amount of serum 
solids, condensed-milk or dry-milk products must be used. With 12 per 
cent or greater a condensed-milk flavor is imparted to the ice cream. Fisher 
also states that butter fat improves the flavor slowly. 

Sandy ice cream. When too great an amount of condensed milk is 
added, there is danger of the lactose crystallizing at the low temperatures 
in the holding room. When the lactose crystallizes, a sandy or gritty tex- 
ture is imparted to the ice cream. Such ice cream is called sandy. Leighton 
and Peter have reported that lactose does not usually give sandiness to the 
ice cream unless the concentration of serum solids is high, i.e., about 
12 per cent or more. The lactose may crystallize in the ice cream when the 
percentage of lactose is 6 per cent or more. 

Flavoring. Flavoring is added to the ice cream. Too little flavoring 
to blend with the cream and sugar gives a flat taste; too much makes the 
flavoring the only ingredient evident to the taste. Dahle states that *'Noth- 



INCORPORATING CHOCOLATE OR FRUIT 91 

ing is to be gained by the use of cheap flavors." Crushed fruit, fruit juices, 
and nuts are also used to flavor ice cream. 

The Body and Texture of Ice Cream ^_ 

By body, the v^rhole mass of ice cream is referred to — its firmness, 
its resistance; texture refers to the finer particles of the ice cream. 

Effect of fat on texture. High butter fat produces a firm body, for 
the chilled fat particles are very firm. Too much fat produces a very hard 
ice cream. Fillers are sometimes used to give a better body. In home-made 
ice cream when little cream is used, egg may be added to produce a firmer 
body, and to add flavor. 

Effect of proteins on texture. The milk solids not fat and the 
protein content particularly affect the body of the ice cream. The casein 
and albumin of milk are found as calcium and magnesium caseinates and 
albuminates in the milk. As such they imbibe water and swell. With too 
little protein the body has little resistance, and with too much protein its 
hydration produces a very soggy, heavy ice cream. Mortensen states that 
high serum solids give a smooth mix for they absorb the water, but 
their use can be carried to an extreme. He adds that those who do not 
use a high percentage of serum solids must pay more attention to the 
treatment of the mix. Combs and Martin concluded that a certain amount 
of acidity produces a finished appearance in the mix. They have found that 
too high acidity causes the ice cream to melt quickly, since the reaction is 
brought nearer the isoelectric point of casein and at the isoelectric point 
very little water is held by casein. 

Effect of treatment of the mix on texture. Any treatment of the 
ingredients of the ice cream or of the mix itself that increases the viscosity 
affects the body and texture of the ice cream. Pasteurization, homogeniza- 
tion, and aging all affect the viscosity and will be discussed later. Though 
the texture of the ice cream, like the body, is affected by the ingredients 
used and their proportions, it is also affected to a greater extent than the 
body by the freezing process. The texture of ice cream depends largely 
on the size of the crystals and the amount of air incorporated during 
freezing. 

Incorporating chocolate or fruit. Some special problem studies have 
indicated that the temperature at which the chocolate is combined with the 
other ingredients is the most important factor in obtaining a uniform color 
and not a speckled product. The temperature at which the chocolate is 
combined, at least with a portion of the ingredients, should be above the 
melting point of the chocolate. The chocolate may be added to a portion 
of the milk which has been warmed or made into a sirup. Martin advises 
that the chocolate be made into a sirup with the sugar and a portion of 
the milk. 



92 FREEZING 

Fruit, such as strawberries, raspberries, and peaches, may be put through 
a sieve before adding to the mix. If larger pieces of fruit are desired, they 
can be prevented from freezing into chunks of ice by letting them stand 
for some time, or over night, in a heavy sirup. The sugar entering the 
berries or fruit lowers the freezing point of the fruit, so that it does not 
freeze or is less hard. To keep the fruit as whole as possible, the sirup 
should be added to the cream mix. Then the fruit is added after the cream 
is in a soft frozen state. 

The freezing process. If the ice-cream mix has not been cooled 
before it is put in the freezer it is better to turn the freezer slowly until 
the mix is cooled. If the freezer is turned rapidly while the mix is at a 
temperature above 4.5°C. or 40°F. the butter fat is clumped together and 
a buttery product results. If carried far enough, butter may even be 
churned in the mix. The mix does not hold the air incorporated in it until 
its temperature is cooled to about 1°C. or 34°F., so that rapid turning is 
of no advantage from this standpoint until the mix is cooled. With a 
freezer turned by hand, if the freezer is turned rapidly all the time, one's 
energy is often expended before the freezing is finished, and it is during 
the latter part of the freezing period that the turning should be rapid. The 
size of the crystals formed during freezing depends upon the rate of turn- 
ing of the freezer and the length of time of the freezing process. Stirring 
the solution during crystallization increases the number of nuclei formed, 
and the resulting crystals are smaller than if the mixture is not stirred. 
If the ice cream is not stirred during freezing, few nuclei are formed, the 
water crystals join onto each other, and a product with very coarse, large, 
spiny crystals is the result. On the other hand, if the ice cream is stirred 
the size of the crystals depends upon the rate of turning. Very slow turn- 
ing while freezing is in progress results in larger crystals; rapid turning 
results in smaller crystals. If the freezer is turned very slowly the crystals 
build onto the crystals already formed ; with rapid turning many new 
crystals are developed. The time of the freezing process also affects the 
size of the crystals. If the crystals are formed very rapidly, too little air is 
mixed with the cream, which produces an ice cream without a velvety 
texture. Since rapid freezing occurs with low temperatures it is better not 
to have the temperature of the brine too low, thus 1 part of salt to 8 parts 
of ice produces good results. 

Overrun. The addition of air to the ice cream during freezing causes 
it to swell so that the ice cream increases in bulk. This increase is known 
as the swell or overrun. 

This swell or overrun due to the incorporation of air particles gives a 
smoother, more velvety texture to the ice cream. Mortensen states that it is 
preferable to have the air cells in the finished cream small, for the strength 
of the film of a small air cell is stronger than that of a large one. To 
obtain small air cells in the ice cream the mix should be viscid. A viscid 



PERCENTAGE OVERRUN 



93 



substance resists incorporation of air, and it will be worked in in finer 
divided portions. With increased viscosity the air is held in the mix better 
after it is incorporated. Mortensen includes homogenization as an impor- 
tant factor in increasing the viscosity of the ice-cream mix. 

As the swell in freezing improves the texture, it is desirable to obtain 
it in home-made ice cream. In the home-made ice cream the freezer is 
often filled so full that there is no room for overrun and no air is beaten 
into the ice cream during freezing. Filling the freezer two-thirds to three- 
fourths full gives good results for home-made ice cream. In home freezing 
the overrun obtained is seldom as great as with commercial ice creams, 
for the freezing conditions in the home are not controlled so carefully as 
in the factory. 

Too great an overrun produces an ice cream of poor body and quality, 
for it becomes very frothy and foamy. An overrun of 50 per cent is con- 
sidered to give a desirable texture. 

Percentage overrun. The percentage of overrun depends upon the 
speed of freezing and rate of turning.

The above table, from Baer's results, shows the effects of the speed of 
the machine on the overrun. He concluded that 50 revolutions per minute 
were too slow, as the overrun was too low, the texture of the ice cream 
was coarse, and the body weak and spiny. 

From the table it will also be noted that increasing the speed of the 
freezer shortens the freezing time. The first crystals are formed at the 
edge of the ice-cream mix and against the side of the metal container. 
The faster speed of turning keeps these crystals scraped away and brings 
warmer portions of the mix against the can to be frozen. In this way the 



94 FREEZING 

whole mass is chilled and frozen more rapidly than it would be if the 
mix were not stirred. 

For home freezing it is probably better to over-freeze a little but not 
too much, if the ice cream is to be served soon after it is frozen. After 
stirring is stopped the rate of cooling is slower. Therefore it requires a 
period of standing after the freezing process is completed for the ice 
cream to harden suitably for serving. Increasing the quantity of salt for 
packing also increases the rate at which the ice cream hardens. 

The Factors Affecting the Viscosity of Cream 
and Ice Cream 

Aging. Sherwood and Smallfield have reported that in some cases 
aging shows an increase in viscosity of the cream whereas in others it does 
not. When the viscosity is increased the fat globules are larger and clump. 
They have found that agitation of the cream reduces the size of the fat 
globules and the viscosity of the cream. Mortensen states that cream 
just separated from fresh milk should be aged 24 hours before it is used 
in ice cream, even if it is not pasteurized. Aging also gives a cream that 
whips better. The viscosity of a cream increases noticeably for about 6 
hours after it is separated and then increases at a slower rate. 

Homogenization. Williams lists the benefits of homogenization, as 
applied to ice cream, under 6 heads as follows: 

1. Increased viscosity. 

2. Reduction in time required for aging. 

3. Less physical and mechanical loss of fat. 

4. Better whipping qualities. 

5. Better freezing qualities. 

6. Greater uniformity and palatability. 

Ice cream made from homogenized cream is smoother and has smaller 
crystals. In homogenization of the cream the fat globules are broken up. 
As the size of the globules is decreased the surface area increases. The 
fat globules are surrounded by a film of protein. After homogenization, 
owing to the increased surface, a larger amount of protein is held in the 
film around the fat particles. The increase in the number of the fat globules 
and the protein held in the film increases the viscosity of the cream. 
After homogenization the cream should not be agitated. The higher the 
pressure used during homogenization, the greater the viscosity obtained in 
the cream. 

With homogenized cream, less fat and less milk solids not fat can be used 
and a texture obtained that is as good as that from an unhomogenized 
cream with higher fat content and with higher milk solids. 

Pasteurization. Pasteurization decreases the viscosity of the cream. 
Cream needs to be aged after pasteurization before it is used in ice cream. 



HOME-MADE ICES AND SHERBETS 95 



The Use of Gelatin in Ice Cream 

Gelatin is used in ice cream to prevent the formation of coarse crystals, 
during softening and hardening of ice cream packed in an ice-and-salt 
mixture, while it is held for selling. Holdway and Reynolds have demon- 
strated that gelatin in ice cream prevents it from losing its shape while it 
is melting. 

Sugar in Ice Cream 

Sugar is used for sweetening the ice cream. It increases the total solids, 
thus improving the body. Too high a percentage lowers the overrun and 
gives an ice cream that is too sweet. 

Sucrose is used in ice cream. Other sugars may be used, such as invert 
sugar from sucrose, corn sugar, and levulose. Since the commercial levulose 
is too expensive, honey may be used. Corn sugar or dextrose is not so sweet 
as sucrose and therefore can be substituted successfully for only about 25 
to 35 per cent of the sucrose in ice cream. 

Making Ice Cream in Refrigerators at Home 

Ice cream may be held as well as frozen in mechanical refrigerators. 
When frozen in them the ice cream often does not have a good texture 
because it is not stirred sufficiently during the freezing process. Some units 
have been made that stir the mixture while it is freezing but they are not 
common. However, quite acceptable ices, sherbets, and even ice cream may 
be made by adding substances, such as egg white or whipped cream, that 
tend to delay crystal growth. Beaten egg white is best for ices and sherbets, 
because this product is more typical of an ice or sherbet texture than the 
product formed by adding rich whipped cream. A good time to add the 
beaten egg white to ices is just as the mixture starts to freeze, for the 
stirring at this time aids in the formation of more nuclei. Whipped cream 
may be added before or after the mixture is placed in the refrigerator tray, 
depending on the type of product to which it is added. 

Ice-Cream Improvers 

The published results of Isenberg and Baer, on the use of ice-cream 
improvers in commercial products, indicates that they would be of prac- 
tically no benefit in home-made ice cream. 

Home-Made Ices and Sherbets 

Ices and sherbets have a lower freezing point than ice cream, for they 
usually contain a greater quantity of sugar. The use of gelatin and egg 



96 FREEZING 

white in home-made ices seems to improve the texture in some instances, 
but in others to have little effect. When the hot sirup is poured over the 
beaten egg white the results obtained are as good as when the beaten egg 
white is added during the freezing process. 

The sherbets in which milk and fruit juices are combined give delightful- 
flavored products for home freezing. 

Classification of Ice Creams 

Various classifications of frozen products have been proposed. Sommer 
gives the following classification of ice cream and related frozen products : 

1. Plain Ice Cream 6. Parfait or New York Ice Cream 

2. Nut Ice Cream 7. Puddings 

3. Fruit Ice Cream 8. Custards 

4. Bisque Ice Cream 9. Ices 

5. iVIousse 10. Sherbets 

Sommer stresses that classification is based on composition rather than 
ingredients used. 

Plain or Philadelphia ice cream has ingredients and composition as 
previously given for commercial ice cream. It may be flavored with a 
variety of flavors, such as vanilla, chocolate, maple. 

Nut or fruit ice creams are plain ice cream with nuts or fruit added. 

Bisque is made from a plain cream basis with such additions as maca- 
roons, grape nuts, dried and broken sponge cake, or marshmallows. 

A mousse has a whipped cream base. 

Parfait, or New York ice cream, is made from the same ingredients as 
plain cream except the amount of egg used is sufficient to produce a dis- 
tinctly yellow color. In some states the amount of egg yolk is specified. 

Puddings differ from fruit ice cream in containing a mixture of fruits 
and to justify the name pudding should have eggs in amounts similar to 
New York ice cream. 

Ices are made from fruit juices diluted with water and sweetened. 

Sherbets are made from the same ingredients as ices with the exception 
that milk, cream, or ice cream is used in place of part or all of the water 
to dilute the fruit juices.

98 FREEZING 



FREEZING 

Experiment 11. 

To determine the temperature of the brine when different proportions of 
ice and salt are mixed. 

The ice for all the freezing experiments should be in pieces of the same size, 
for the very large pieces melt more slowly because of small surface area. 
Put the ice through the ice crusher, which gives pieces of more uniform size. 
If it cannot be crushed in a crusher, but is broken with a hammer or shaved 
with a pick, put it through a large-screen mesh to obtain pieces of uniform 
size. The temperature obtained will be only approximate. For very accurate, 
careful work the temperature must be taken in insulated, closed flasks. 

1. Weigh %. pound of rock salt and an equal amount of ice. Mix well. 
Find the minimum temperature that can be obtained with this mixture and 
the length of time required to reach it. 

Repeat using the following proportions. 

2. One part of salt (>4 lb.) to 3 of ice (>>4 lb.). 

3. One part of salt {yi lb.) to 6 of ice (^ lb.). 

4. One part of salt (>^ lb.) to 8 of ice (1 lb.). 

5. Use equal parts of sugar to ice {yi lb. of each). 

What would the result be if the above experiments were repeated using 
coarse crystalline salt in place of the rock salt? Does the sugar have the same 
effect as salt? Why?

Ice Cream 

Experiment 12. 

To determine the effect of the rate of turning on the texture of ice cream. 

Directions for freezing experiments: 

The freezers for the following experiments should be in good working order. 
The dashers should turn and scrape the crystals from the side of the can as 
they are formed. 

To find the approximate swell of the ice cream the depth of the mixture 
should be measured in the can before and after freezing. If the depth is 2 inches 
before freezing and 3 inches after freezing the approximate swell is 50 per cent. 
The frozen mixture is not level across the top, so this method gives only an 
approximate measure of the swell. 

Before the freezer is packed, the dasher, lid, and handle should be put in 



ICE CREAM 99 

place. Otherwise in packing the can is often pushed to one side and it is difficult 
to get the handle in place. See that the handle turns properly. 

Measure the approximate amount of ice and salt required for your particu- 
lar experiment. For a freezer of 1-quart capacity, and using the proportions 1 
part of salt to 8 parts of ice by measure, about 10 cups of ice are required 
for freezing. This will sometimes pack or partially pack the freezer also. 
Consult the instructor for the method to use for mixing ice and salt to place 
in the freezer. More uniform results are obtained with class work by mixing 
the salt and ice before placing in the freezer unless uniform methods of packing 
are employed. The better way of packing is to measure the ice required to 
pack the freezer half way to the top. Then add a layer of salt, using ys of 
the measure of the ice. Add a layer of ice to }i the distance from the top. 
Add a layer of salt, again using j^ the amount of the ice. Add ice nearly to 
the top of the can and the same proportions of salt. If the ice and salt are 
not measured, different amounts will be used for the different groups and the 
results will not be uniform, for the variables of the same experiments will 
increase. 

Remove the handle and lid after the ice is packed and add the mixture to be 
frozen. If the freezer is the type that will freeze with the lid off, leave the 
lid off and adjust the handle. By freezing in this way the ice and brine will not 
come to the top of the can, but if not more than 1 cup of the mix is used in 
a quart freezer the frozen mixture will not come more than half way up the 
can, and the ice and salt will be sufficient for freezing. 

Record the total time of turning the freezer and the time when the first 
crystals are formed; notice when the swell begins. Turn until the frozen mix- 
ture is the consistency of good thick gravy. Compare with your neighbors' so 
that all will be of the same consistency when the freezing period is stopped. 

If the freezer will not turn with the lid removed, the end point of the 
freezing will need to be determined by removing the lid. Compare with your 
neighbors' so that as nearly as possible all will be of the same consistency when 
the creams are packed. If the lids of the freezers cannot be removed, neither 
the swell nor the time when the first crystals form can be observed. Nor can 
the time required for freezing be estimated very accurately. The results are 
less uniform with this type of freezer and sometimes are not worth while. 
Obviously, if some freezers are not in working condition the results from them 
should not be recorded. If the dashers do not work properly then the results 
can be used for slow-turning freezers. 

Remove the dasher, put on the lid, plug the hole in the top of the lid and 
pack to harden. If the period of hardening can be only a short one, a larger 
proportion of salt to ice may be used for packing. Consult the instructor for 
the proportions. 

Freezing mixtures that contain the same proportion of ingredients will have 
the same freezing point. Take the temperature while freezing in the can that is 
turned slowly. Since it is to be turned slowly the results for it will not be 
affected if the turning is stopped while the freezing temperature is taken. 

Take the temperature of each of the frozen mixtures before tasting. During 
hardening some of the frozen mixtures may reach lower temperatures than 
others. Why? Because of this lower temperature they will be harder and colder. 
If possible they should be the same temperature before tasting. If they are not 



100 



FREEZING 



the same temperature In tasting do not confuse coldness and firmness of body 
with texture. The body should be firm and the texture smooth and velvety, 
that is, the crystals should be small and the cream should not be buttery. 

An electrically operated freezer is preferable for many of the freezing 
experiments, as the rate of turning can be kept uniform. But unless it has 
different speeds, it cannot be used for determining the effect of rate of turning 
the freezer. 

It is better for two girls to work together for each of the freezing experi- 
ments. 

Recipe: 



Cream 


1 cup 


240 grams 


Sugar 


3 tablespoons 


37.5 grams 


Vanilla 


X teaspoon 





Use coffee cream containing 18 to 20 per cent fat. Dissolve the sugar in the 
cream. Add vanilla and freeze. 

1. Turn slowly all the time: about 40 turns or less per minute. 

2. Turn slowly at first, then rapidly while freezing; 40 turns or less per 
minute at first, then about 100 turns per minute. 

3. Turn rapidly all the time: about 100 turns per minute. 

The following headings are suggested for records of the freezing experi- 
ments. After all the experiments have been performed, write a summary of 
your conclusions and applications.

Experiment 13. 

To determine the effect of the richness of the cream used in making ice 
cream. 

Use the same proportions given in Experiment 12. Use 1 part of salt to 8 of 
ice. Turn slowly at first, then rapidly during the freezing period, or use an 
electric freezer. 

1. Use cream containing 18 per cent fat. 

2. Use cream containing 24 per cent fat. If equal quantities of coffee cream 
(18 to 20 per cent) and whipping cream (30 to 32) are mixed, a cream with 
approximately 24 per cent of fat will be obtained. 

3. Use a cream containing 30 per cent fat. 

Does the amount of fat affect the freezing point? What would be the effect 
of a longer freezing period on the creams with a high fat content? Would It be 
advantageous to use a smaller proportion of salt for freezing these ice creams?

CHAPTER IV 

FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

Losses in Cooking Vegetables 

The losses that occur in cooking fruits and vegetables are of three types: 
first, the losses due to volatile substances ; second, the losses due to the solu- 
bility of some of the substances of the fruit or the vegetable in water during 
preparation and cooking, and the discarding of this water; third, the losses 
due to the destruction of some substances by heating. 

The volatile loss is composed largely of water but includes some acids 
and substances that give flavor and odor. The greatest part of the volatile 
loss can be replaced by the addition of water. The other volatile substances 
affect the flavor more than the food value and will be considered later. 

Water in which fruit is soaked and cooked is seldom discarded, so that 
this type of loss pertains more to the cooking of vegetables. Vegetables 
contain the following food nutrients: protein, fat, carbohydrates, minerals, 
and vitamins. Decrease of these nutrients during cooking is due largely to 
their loss. Vegetables contain little fat, thus fat loss in their cookery is 
relatively unimportant. The starch from vegetables is insoluble in water. 
The loss of starch from vegetables occurs when the cell walls are broken 
by cutting in preparation, disintegration through over-cooking or from 
abrasion, which may occur in violent boiling and cause the sloughing off of 
parts of the vegetable near the surface. 

Nitrogen. The nitrogenous or nitrogen-containing part of fruits and 
vegetables may be classified for convenience as composed of proteins and 
non-proteins. The nitrogenous content of vegetables, with the exception of 
the legumes, is low. The albumins are soluble in water and dilute salt 
solutions, the globulins in dilute neutral salt solutions. They are both 
coagulable by heat. Their greatest loss would occur when the vegetable is 
soaked before cooking, or when cold water is added to the vegetable to 
start the cooking process. In salted water some of the albumins and globu- 
lins would be dissolved. 

McKee and Smith in their investigations of the protein of the cauli- 
flovv^er found that 68 per cent of the nitrogen of the edible part belongs 
to constituents soluble in water or dilute salt solution; 12 per cent to 
compounds soluble in 0.3 per cent sodium hydroxide, but not soluble in 
water; and 16 per cent to substances insoluble in either water or dilute 
alkali. Their results show a large proportion of the nitrogen compounds 

103 



104 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

soluble in water and dilute salt solution, indicating that it is preferable 
to start cooking in boiling water to coagulate the albumins and globulins. 

Some of the nitrogenous substances are soluble at all temperatures. The 
foaming of the cooking water is partially due to these substances, and par- 
tially to tannins and saponins. All these substances lower the surface tension 
of the cooking water and favor foaming. Foaming occurs in the cooking 
of some vegetables, such as peas and asparagus, more than in others. 

The important changes in the cookery of vegetables come from the loss 
of sugars, vitamins, and minerals. The sugars are very soluble in cold and 
hot water. Their loss is lessened if the vegetable is left in large pieces, 
which give less surface for contact with the water than small pieces. 

Vitamins. The loss of vitamins in cooking may come from destruction 
by heat or by oxidation as well as loss in the discarded cooking water. 

Mineral salts. The principal minerals in foods that may be lost 
during cooking are the salts of sodium (Na), potassium (K), calcium 
(Ca), magnesium (Mg), phosphorus (P), sulfur (S), iron (Fe), chlorine 
(CI), and iodine (I). Sodium, potassium, magnesium, and calcium are a 
valuable part of the mineral content of fruits and vegetables, as an excess 
of this group over the phosphorus, sulfur, and chlorine group produces an 
alkaline ash reaction in the body after the food nutrients have been ab- 
sorbed from the intestinal tract. Potassium particularly is found in high 
percentage in most vegetables. Most of its salts as well as those of sodium 
are quite soluble in water so that their loss in discarded cooking liquor 
may be high. As a rule, the calcium salts are not so soluble as the other 
salts found in vegetables; in some vegetables they seem to be in an in- 
soluble form, but in others the calcium loss is about one-fourth of the 
total calcium of the food. Magnesium salts are more soluble than those of 
calcium. Vegetables, with the exception of the legumes, contain small per- 
centages of phosphorus when compared with some other foods. The phos- 
phorus salts are easily soluble, and the phosphorus loss in discarded water 
may amount to 50 per cent or more of the total phosphorus of the vege- 
table. 

The solubility of most of the salts found in vegetables increases with 
increasing temperature of the water, so that at 100°C. they are more 
soluble than at ordinary temperatures. 

Peterson and Hoppert, using medium and large quantities of water for 
cooking vegetables, report the loss of calcium to be practically nothing in 
spinach. In other vegetables the loss is about 30 per cent of the total cal- 
cium. They report that the magnesium loss varies from 20 to 45 per cent, 
the phosphorus from 20 to 50 per cent. Berry reports as high as 60 per cent 
for magnesium and 52 per cent for phosphorus. 

The following losses for cooking vegetables in water are reported in 
U. of Minn., Agri. Expt. Sta. Bull. 54, and in U. S. Dept. Agri. Farmers' 
Bull. 73.

Iron. The iron of foods is very important nutritionally, because of 
the fact that many dietaries do not contain the minimum daily amount 
recommended by Sherman. The loss of iron in cooking should be avoided. 
Iron salts are quite soluble. Blunt and Otis report the following losses of 
iron when the vegetables were cooked in water: spinach 43 per cent; 
string beans 39 per cent; navy beans 32 per cent; peas 36 per cent; and

potatoes 15 per cent. Peterson and Hoppert report from 20 to 30 per 
cent iron loss for various vegetables. Morgan reports 46 to 50 per cent 
loss for canned peas. 

Steinbarger reports the loss of iron as greater in salted than in unsalted 
water. Table 14 is from her results. 

The vegetables given in Table 14 were cooked the following lengths 
of time: potatoes and onions 20 minutes; green beans 90 minutes; and the 
others 30 minutes. The results suggest some connection between iron salts 
and the globulins. The iron salts of potatoes have been reported as more 
concentrated near the surface, which may account for their high iron loss. 

Losses due to method o£ cooking and preparation. The losses 
through cooking of vegetables depend upon several factors, which include: 
(1) the method of cooking, (2) the nature of the vegetable, (3) its prep- 
aration, (4) the length of time of cooking, (5) the temperature of cooking, 
(6) the quantity of cooking water, (7) whether started in hot or cold 
water, and (8) the reaction of the cooking medium. Some of these have 
been considered under nitrogen and vitamin losses. 

Baking results in small nutritive losses. 

All investigators report small losses in steaming; this seems to be an 
ideal way of cooking vegetables whose color and flavor are not altered 
by this method. 

Masters and Garbutt report practically no loss in cooking vegetables in 
water, if the amount of water added is small and is evaporated just to 
dryness at the close of the cooking period. They designate this as the 
conservative method of cooking. If it is not practicable to evaporate the 
water to dryness, the use of as small a quantity of water as possible seems 
preferable to using a very large quantity. 

Leafy vegetables like spinach offer a larger surface area for loss than 
the compact ones like carrots. Soaking in water before cooking may increase 
the losses, and vegetables like carrots and potatoes, when cooked whole, 
in their skins, or left in large pieces lose less than if cut in small pieces. 

Loughlin reports that the amount of the sugars, the vitamins, and mineral 
salts dissolved in the cooking water is increased if a large amount of liquid 
is used, if much cut surface is exposed, and if the cooking time is prolonged. 

Thompson reports that the total loss of solids, ash, and iron is greater 
in vegetables that are over-cooked than in those just sufHciently cooked. 

The Plant Acids 

The plant acids, the plant pigments, and the cellulose are constituents 
of the vegetable less often considered than the other food nutrients. Knowl- 
edge of the common reactions of these constituents renders one able to 
serve fruits and vegetables that are attractive in appearance, color, and 
texture 



ACIDS IN VEGETABLES 107 

Plant acids. Plants contain organic acids. According to chemical 
classification the acids may belong to different groups, but for consideration 
in cooking they may be divided into two classes, the volatile and non- 
volatile ones. Volatile acids are the ones that volatilize and pass from the 
liquid as vapor. The odor of acetic acid or vinegar during cooking is vrell 
knovrn. The following acids of the CnHo„02 series are volatile, the first 
ones being more volatile than the last ones: 

Formic acid H-COOH 

Acetic acid CHg-COOH 

Propionic acid CH3-CH2'COOH 

Butyric acid CH3 • CH2 • CH2 • COOH 

Valeric acid CH3 • CH2 • CH2 • CH2 • COOH 

Caproic acid CH3 • CH2 • CH2 • CH2 • CH2 • COOH 

Formic and acetic acids have been obtained from plants during distilla- 
tion. Onslow states that propionic acid has only rarely been found in 
plants. 

The amount of volatile acids found in plants varies ; it also varies in the 
same plant. Koch found that cooking 125 grams of spinach for 1 hour and 
collecting the distillate required 18 cc. of N/\0 NaOH to neutralize the 
volatile acids. Another experiment in which the same weight of spinach was 
used and cooked for the same length of time required only 6 cc. of N/\0 
NaOH. 

Non-volatile acids. Not all the acids found in fruits and vegetables 
are volatile. The following are some of the more common non-volatile ones 
found in foods: 

Dicarboxylic acids 

OxaHc acid COOH • COOH 

Malonic acid COOH • CH2 • COOH 

Succinic acid COOH • CH2 • CH2 • COOH 

Glutaric acid COOH • (CH2)3 • COOH 

Adipic acid COOH • (CH2)4 • COOH 

Hydroxydicarhoxylic acids 

MaHc acid COOH • CHOH • CH2 • COOH 

Tartaric acid COOH ■ CHOH • CHOH • COOH 

Hydroxytricarboxylic acids 

Citric acid COOH • CH2 • COH • CH2 • COOH

Acids in vegetables. The acids are found in the fruits, leaves, stem, 
and root stocks. The acid may occur in the free form, but is often com- 
bined as a salt or an ester. 

Because of oxaluria the oxalic acid content of vegetables is of interest. 
Onslow states that oxalic acid ''occurs very frequently and widely dis- 



108 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

tributed in plants, usually as the calcium salt, and apparently less fre- 
quently as the sodium and potassium salts. It has rarely been detected as 
the free acid. The calcium salt is precipitated on adding calcium acetate 
to a solution of the acid. Calcium oxalate is insoluble in acetic acid, but 
soluble in dilute mineral acids." It is found in the rumex or dock family, 
of which different docks and sour grass are used as food. Sorrel and rhubarb 
contain a rather high percentage. Rider has reported the most extensive 
determinations of oxalic acid in leafy vegetables. She has found that the 
amount in spinach ranges from 0.486 to 0.692 per cent. Beet greens give 
an equivalent or slightly higher amount than spinach, and New Zealand 
spinach contains a still higher percentage. No oxalic acid w^as found in 
dandelion greens, kale, turnip greens, and mustard greens. McLaughlin 
has reported the oxalic acid content of eight samples of New Zealand 
spinach as ranging from 0.49 to 0.53 per cent, anhydrous. As these figures 
indicate, the amount in different samples of the same vegetable may vary. 
Rider mentions this fact in connection with the samples she analyzed. 
Nelson has reported 0.31 per cent oxalic acid in spinach. 

Succinic acid is found in many plants, and glutaric and adipic have been 
isolated from the sugar beet. 

Malic acid is found as the free acid and as the salts of malic acid in 
many plants, and particularly in apples and pears. 

Citric acid is found in tomatoes and it is found in smaller quantities in 
other foods. Blunt reports small amounts in cabbage, asparagus, and string 
beans. 

Nelson has reported that spinach contains both citric and malic acids. The 
ratio of citric to malic acid in broccoli was 3 :2. The leaves and buds 
contained approximately the same proportions. Small amounts of oxalic 
and succinic are also present. The acid content of lettuce was as follows: 
oxalic, 1 -malic, and citric, 0.011, 0.065, and 0.048 per cent respectively. 

Tomatoes, which have the highest amount of acid of our common 
vegetables, contain citric acid. Blunt reports 0.42 per cent. 

The acids found in fruits. Conflicting reports appear in the literature 
regarding the particular acid in different foods. Bigelow and Dunbar sug- 
gest that this is due to the inaccurate methods of analysis often used and 
to the difficulty in separating the different acids from one another. Nelson 
has reported the approximate percentages of the various acids in fresh 
fruits, the average total acidity being calculated as citric. His results are 
given in Table 15. 

Nelson states that the most common acids in fruits, citric and malic, 
may occur in different proportions or one alone may be present. "The 
total acidity of most fruits varies with the variety and the degree of ripe- 
ness. The relative proportions of the various acids may also vary with the 
degree of ripeness, variety, and climatic and soil conditions." 

Rhubarb contains some oxalic acid ; cranberries and plums some benzoic. 
Other acids sometimes found in small quantities are succinic, lactic, iso-

citric, and acetic. Nelson reports acetic acid in figs, isocitric in blackberries, 
and tartaric in grapes. Bigelow and Dunbar have reported that both citric 
and malic acids are found in gooseberry, the total acid for different varieties 
varying from 1.72 to 2.63 per cent. 

Mineral salts of organic acids may be formed during the cooking of 
fruits in metal containers. Very unpalatable flavors are developed in this 
way, and the color of the cooked product is darkened. This brings to 
memory a sample of plum butter sent to the Department. It was nearly 
charcoal black in color, and as for flavor might have been made from 
any fruit, for there was little of the original fruit flavor left. The sender 
stated it had been cooked on the back of the stove in a tin wash boiler 
for three days and was much perturbed because a neighbor had told her it 
was poisonous on account of the cooking utensil used. Hence a sample was 
sent with the request to try it and see if it was poisonous.

Just as inorganic acids may combine with metals to produce acid or 
neutral salts according to whether part or all of the hydrogen is replaced 
by the metal, so in a similar way organic acids may combine with metals 
forming salts.

Zinc utensils. Some of the metal salts formed with organic acids are 
injurious when taken into the body. The zinc salts of organic acids have 
been regarded as toxic. They are formed when foods containing acids are 
placed in galvanized containers. Galvanized iron contains some zinc, and 
when fruits, beverages, or even milk are placed in utensils made of it, the 
acids of the food combine with the zinc, forming salts. 

Sale and Badger have reported that zinc is dissolved from galvanized 
utensils, and the greater the acidity of the food and the longer the food 
stays in such containers the more zinc dissolved. Even fresh milk contains 
enough acid to dissolve appreciable amounts of zinc. 

Burke, Woodson, and Heller, after investigating the toxicity of butter- 
milk held in galvanized containers, question the attributing of the toxicity 
to zinc in many previous investigations, and think that in some cases the 
toxicity may have been due to the surface of the galvanized container being 
contaminated with some other substance, possibly arsenic, lead, or antimony. 

The tin salts have not been found poisonous, but large amounts of them 
in a food, such as would result when an acid fruit is cooked for a long 
time in a tin wash boiler, produce a very dark color and a disagreeable 
metallic flavor. 

Iron salts with acids may cause discoloration in some food products. 



Plant Pigments 

Chlorophyll. Chlorophyll, the green pigment of plants, plays an im- 
portant role in their synthesis of carbohydrates. The cells of the mesophyll 
of the leaf contain chloroplasts or chlorophyll-corpuscles, the nucleus, other 
substances, and the cell liquid with its dissolved materials. The chloro- 
plasts contain four pigments, two green ones, chlorophyll a and chlorophyll 
Z>, and two yellow ones, carotene and xanthophyll. 

Solubility of chlorophyll. Chlorophyll is not soluble in water. Very little 



CHLOROPHYLL 111 

green color is found in the water in which green vegetables have been 
cooked. Pure isolated chlorophyll is soluble in acetone, ether and benzene. 
In extracting the pigment from thoroughly dry leaves it is necessary to add 
about 20 per cent of water to the acetone or other solvent. One explana- 
tion for this is that chlorophyll is in the colloidal state in the leaf, and 
the mineral constituents of the leaf, dissolved in the water, peptize it, 
rendering it soluble. Onslow states that "the condition of chlorophyll is 
altered by plunging into boiling water. The pigment is then much more 
soluble, in ether, etc., even when the leaves are subsequently dried. It is 
supposed that the chlorophyll has diffused out from the plastids, and is in 
true solution in the accompanying waxy substances which have become 
liquid owing to change in temperature." 

When green vegetables are dropped into boiling water a change takes 
place nearly instantly, the green color being intensified. Various explana- 
tions have been offered for the phenomenon. One is that the hot water has 
melted waxy constituents of the leaf so the chlorophyll escapes from the 
cell more readily or may become more soluble. Or the hot water may have 
dissolved salts or other substances in contact with the chlorophyll so that 
it diffuses more readily. 

For peas, Kohman states that one factor in the intensification of the 
green color is the removal of air from the pea when it is dropped in the 
boiling water. The outer skin of the pea is transparent, the space beneath 
this being impregnated with air which is removed when the peas are 
blanched. That this change in color is caused by removal of the air can be 
shown by subjecting the peas to an adequate vacuum under cold water 
and releasing the vacuum while the peas are still under the water. 

Composition of chlorophyll. Willstatter, whose work gave us the formula 
for and the chemical reactions of chlorophyll, reports that it exists in two 
forms, depending upon the degree of oxidation in the plant cells: form {a) 
and form {b) . The former exists in the proportion of three to one of the 
latter.

Chlorophyll contains 2.7 per cent of the metal magnesium. It contains

alcohol (COOC20H39). 



112 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

Reactions of chlorophyll with alkalies. Chlorophyll is a neutral substance 
but gives characteristic reactions when treated with alkalies or acids. Will- 
statter designates the parent substance of chlorophyll as chlorophyllin. The 
reaction of chlorophyllin with methyl and phytol alcohols gives the ester 
chlorophyll. Chlorophyll, when treated in the cold with alkalies, gives 
alkaline salts of chlorophyllin. The color change is first brown, followed 
by a return of the green, but it is no longer fluorescent. When chlorophyll 
is saponified with hot alcoholic alkalies, isochlorophyllins are formed, which 
are fluorescent.

When the green-colored vegetables are cooked in water with an alkaline 
reaction, or in water to which a small amount of soda is added, they 
develop a bright, intense green color. 

Reaction of chlorophyll with acids. Chlorophyll reacts with acids to 
give an olive-colored product, without fluorescence, called phaeophytin. The 
magnesium of the chlorophyll is replaced by hydrogen. From phaeophytin, 
Willstatter has obtained two decomposition groups: the first, designated as 
phytochlorins, are olive green and derived from chlorophyll a; the second, 
the phytorhodins, are red and derived from chlorophyll b.

The effect of heat upon chlorophyll. The chlorophyll is changed to the 
olive-green color by two means, ( 1 ) by hydrogen ions or an acid reaction and 
(2) by heat. As previously given, the hydroxyl ions, or an alkaline reac- 
tion, produces chlorophyll salts with bright green color. In general, the 
more acid the reaction, the more rapid is this change in color w^hen the 
vegetable is heated ; or, vice versa, the more alkaline the reaction, the more 
slowly the chlorophyll changes to olive-green. Thus in order that the bright 
green color be retained in cooking green vegetables, they should be cooked 



CHLOROPHYLL 113 

for as short a time as possible and contact with acids should be avoided as 
far as possible. It is also possible that other ions than the hydrogen and 
hydroxyl ions may affect the stability of the chlorophyll, for some vege- 
tables with nearly the same />H, cooked in water from the same source, 
and with other conditions standardized are more stable to heat than others. 

In cooking certain procedures may aid in decreasing the acidity of the 
cooking water. The vegetables contain both volatile and non-volatile acids, 
which in the plant are prevented from uniting with the chlorophyll but 
are liberated when the plant tissues are heated. If the cooking vessel is not 
covered, the volatile acids may escape with the steam, thus decreasing the 
acidity. 

It has been found that the highest percentage of these volatile acids 
passes off during the first few minutes of cooking. Hence, if the cooking 
vessel needs to be covered for a part of the time, it is preferable to have 
the uncovered period the first few minutes. 

Certain water, such as hard water, softened water, or water from many 
streams, is alkaline in reaction. Rain water, snow, or ice water is usually 
about neutral. If the cooking water contains alkaline salts, these salts may 
neutralize the non-volatile acids, and if there is a slight excess of alkaline 
salts the green color is intensified. To a certain extent the intensification 
depends upon the quantity of water used, for the larger quantity of water 
contains a greater quantity of alkaline salts. If the water is only slightly 
alkaline the plant acids may not all be neutralized and the olive-green color 
may develop. If the water is very alkaline and considerable water is used, 
not enough volatile and non-volatile acids will be liberated to neutralize 
the alkalinity of the water, the cover can be kept on during cooking, and 
the product will be bright green. With longer cooking the heat may have 
more effect upon the chlorophyll than the alkaline salts of the water. The 
addition of sodium bicarbonate (baking soda). Experiment 17A, 5, also 
intensifies the green color. Canned spinach, asparagus, peas, and string 
beans have a deep olive-green color due to the retention of the plant acids 
during processing and to the high temperature at which they are processed. 
Green vegetables like cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and spinach cooked in 
milk may remain a bright green color. Owing to the ease with which milk 
scorches and boils over there is usually less tendency to cook the vege- 
tables too long when milk is used. 

Heat decomposes chlorophyll, an olive-green color being produced. The 
extent of decomposition depends upon the time of heating and the tem- 
perature reached. With a very short cooking period little destruction may 
occur, but with a longer time all the chlorophyll may be decomposed. At 
lower temperatures the change is less rapid and at higher temperatures 
more rapid. Thus in a pressure cooker the change is rapid, since the tempera- 
ture is high and acidity is not decreased because the volatile acids are 
retained. Increasing the alkalinity by using alkaline water or adding soda 



114 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

retards the color change by heat. However, the addition of soda is not 
advisable, because it softens the cellulose rapidly so that the vegetable with 
slight over-cooking becomes mushy or even slimy and the destruction of 
some of the vitamins is hastened. 

The cooking of green vegetables that contain enough acid to taste sour, 
like sorrel, sour grass, and dock, always produces this olive-green color 
no matter how cooked or for how short a time. Their acid content is too 
high to be neutralized by the alkaline salts of water or the addition of 
baking soda in small amounts. Green fruits like gooseberries, green grapes, 
and green plums develop an olive-green color when cooked. If the fruits are 
mature they may also contain yellow pigments that modify the color to a 
certain extent. 

If acid is to be added as a seasoning to green vegetables it is preferable 
to add it when served, for there will not be so long a time for the acid 
to react on the chlorophyll and less brown color will develop. When 
vegetables are cooked with added acid, the softening of the vegetable is 
prevented to a slight extent. 

Replacing magnesium in chlorophyll products. It is very difficult to re- 
place the magnesium of the magnesium-free chlorophyll products. It can 
be done chemically by using a very reactive substance, magnesium methyl 
iodide, but this is impracticable to use in cooking processes. However, Will- 
statter states that the acetate salts of some metals such as copper, iron, and 
zinc will combine with phaeophytin and give very bright green-colored 
products. This is such a good test for small quantities of these metals that 
it is necessary in isolating chlorophyll to be extremely careful that it does 
not come in contact with them. If to the green vegetable to which acid has 
been added and in which the olive-green color has developed. Experiment 
17A, 6, copper acetate is added, a vivid green color will develop on 
standing. 

Carotinoids. Carotinoids is a term applied to the pigments giving yel- 
low and orange coloring to fruits and flowers, carotene, C4oHr,o, and 
xanthophyll, C4oHr,(;02. The carotinoids are not soluble in water, and the 
pigments are not affected, to any great extent, by the concentration of 
acids or alkalies used in food preparation. The darkening produced by the 
action of alkalies by caramelization of the sugar in vegetables, like carrots, 
must not be confused with a change in pigment color. Carotene is easily 
oxidized when exposed to air. Xanthophyll can also be oxidized in the same 
way. One of the characteristics of the carotinoids is the intensity of their 
coloring. The red pigment found in tomatoes is lycopin, an isomer of 
carotene. 

Flavones and Flavonols. Flavones and flavonols are amphoteric pig- 
ments found in vegetables and petals of flowers. They are also found in the 
cell sap of the epidermis and underlying tissue of plants. Onslow gives the 
following formulas : 



FLAVONES AND FLAVONOLS 



115 




flavonol 

As they occur in nature they often have other or additional hydrogen 
atoms replaced by hydroxyl groups. The position of the hydroxyl groups 
markedly influences the intensity of color, the color usually being deeper 
if two hydroxyl groups are in the ortho position to each other. The flavone 
and flavonol pigments are yellovr in color. In plants they often occur as 
glucosides, one or more of the hydroxyl groups being combined with the 
sugar, and then the color is less intense. They give an intense yellow color 
with alkalies. Sometimes the quantity of them found in white vegetables 
is so minute that they are not visible. Adding an alkali or holding them 
over ammonia vapor intensifies the color and they become visible. The 
color changes of the flavones cannot be observed so readily in the yellow, 
red, or green vegetables. 

Rice cooked in alkaline water usually has a yellow tinge, and sometimes 
it is rather deep in hue or has a green tint. Rice from the same source as 
that cooked in alkaline water, but cooked in distilled water, has a snowy 
white appearance. 

The cooking of cauliflower, white cabbage, and particularly white onions 
in alkaline water often causes the yellow color to develop. Some white 
onions cooked in the hard water at Ames have developed nearly a sulfur 
yellow in color, whereas portions of the same onions cooked in distilled 
water remained white, or retained their natural yellow tinge. 

Potatoes must often contain flavones, as they sometimes develop a yellow 
or green color in alkaline water. Mashed potatoes that have a strong 
alkaline taste may be improved in flavor by adding a very small amount of 
cream of tartar. 

Flavones and flavonols with iron salts turn green and then brown. This 



116 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

may explain some color changes that occur when foods are cooked in 
chipped enamel utensils having an iron base. 

Anthocyanins. The anthocyans include a group of pigments that, like 
sugars, have similar composition and properties yet have individual dif- 
ferences. As a rule they occur as glucosides in different parts of the plant 
and are known as anthocyanins in this combination. When the glucoside is 
hydrolyzed by boiling with dilute acid the non-glucosidal pigment portion 
is called anthocyanidin. The anthocyanins are soluble in water. Onslow 
states that occasionally they crystallize from the cell sap. Most but not all 
of the anthocyanins are soluble in alcohol. The anthocyan pigments give 
the blue, purple, violet, and red shades to different parts of the plant. 
They are very widely distributed. Onslow states that the plant that does 
not produce them is the exception rather than the rule. They occur in 
apples, cherries, currants, grapes, blueberries, red and black raspberries, 
in some varieties of peaches and plums, and in red cabbage, radishes, beets, 
and other fruits and vegetables. 

All the anthocyanins so far isolated have fallen into one of three groups. 
They are illustrated as the chlorides. The number of hydroxy groups 
attached to the side benzene ring is made the basis of the classification. 
The glucosides of these anthocyanidins are called pelargonins, cyanins, and 
delphinins. 

One of the reactions that the anthocyanins have in common is their 
color changes. Onslow states that the pigment should be pure to test the 
color reactions, for in the plant the pigment is found with other substances 
that may modify the reaction. In an acid solution, pure anthocyans are 
usually red ; in an alkaline one they are violet or blue, but if flavones or 
flavonols are present, a green color is obtained through the mixture of the 
blue and yellow. Yet the solutions of many fruit juices show typical color 
changes. In ordinary solutions of plant pigments they become green, then 
yellow, and sometimes brown upon the addition of alkali. If the alkali is 
very weak, or with salts with a weak alkaline reaction, a blue color may 
form and the green may never develop, or the blue may be intermediate 
between the red and the green. 

Color changes of fruit juices. Pratt and Swartout state that the solu- 
tions of many fruit pigments act as indicators; that the solutions are easily 
prepared and stable; that the liquid indicators can be used in titrating 
acids, but not bases, for in a solution no more than moderately alkaline 
they soon decompose, all of them producing a brown color which does not 
change when acid is added. They found that apricots, peaches, pears, per- 
simmons, and tomatoes failed to yield pigments that could be used as in- 
dicators. It is interesting that the pigment of cactus holds its red color 
even in a distinctly alkaline medium. They also state that "the pigment of 
red beets remained red through the acid range and into the alkaline range 
at least as far as /»H 13.0." In their conclusion they recommend that the 
greatest usefulness of the indicators is in test papers.

Fruit colors and punch. Combinations of fruit juices for punch can yield 
beautiful, clear colors, or ugly, muddy ones. If a red color is desired, use 
red- or blue-colored juices and keep the reaction acid by the addition of 
lemon juice. For a purple shade, choose fruit juices nearly neutral in 
reaction and do not add lemon juice. A blue color can usually be intensified 
by the addition of canned pineapple juice. (See the following paragraph.) 
Alkaline water may or may not give a bluish tinge to red fruit juices, 
depending on the alkalinity of the water and the acidity of the juice. Orange

juice should be added to red or blue fruit juices only when a brownish 
or magenta shade is desired, for often this combination is not attractive. 
From the colors produced, or unless very small proportions of one color 
are used, the red and yellow, blue and yellow, or green and yellow com- 
binations should be avoided. 

The color change obtained by the addition of canned pineapple juice 
to grape, wild grape, blackberry, raspberry, or loganberry juices cannot be 
explained on the basis of acidity alone. Even if these juices have had a 
large quantity of lemon juice added they usually turn blue or the original 



ANTHOCYANINS 119 

blue shade is intensified and particularly after the juices have been mixed 
and left standing a short time. Tin salts from the canned pineapple may 
be one cause for the color change. In addition, proteins, tannins, and ferric 
salts may play a role in causing color changes. Also many of the salts of 
the anthocyanins have characteristic colors which are independent of mild 
changes in acidity. Many organic substances also have characteristic color 
changes. 

Violet colorations in canned fruits. Culpepper and Caldwell have re- 
ported the cause of violet coloration of some fruits canned in tin con- 
tainers. The red anthocyan pigments have the property of combining with 
tin, forming salts that are violet colored. The salts are formed when the 
material containing the pigment is heated with tin. They find that "the 
amount of the violet compound formed is determined by the amount of 
pigment present, and by the degree of acidity of the medium, low acidity 
favoring its formation, high acidity depressing or suppressing it." The ad- 
dition of an alkali intensifies the violet color; the addition of acid restores 
the original red color. The violet color is deepened by standing in the air 
after opening the can. 

Color changes of red vegetables. Clark gives in his list of indicators that 
red cabbage extract is red at /)H 2.4 and green at />H 4.5. However, the 
results in this laboratory have not agreed with those of Clark. In general 
there is lack of agreement in reports of />H at which the pigment of red 
cabbage turns blue. There are probably two reasons for this. The antho- 
cyanins combine with metals to form salts, the particular metal influencing 
the color reactions. Also the color developed at a given />H may depend 
upon the time of exposure at that p\i. The cabbage itself, when cooked in 
water or juice pressed from the cabbage, shows changes at varying reac- 
tions, which have varied slightly at different times. This is probably due 
to other constituents and their concentration in addition to the red cabbage 
coloring. Temperature and time of standing before the determinations were 
made also affect the /)H. 

Usually at a />H of 2.4 to about 4.0 the color is red, showing gradual 
changes through blue-red, purple or violet, red-blue, and finally blue. These 
changes occur over a rather wide range of />H, the blue developing at 
/)H 6 or above. The green color develops with greater alkalinity at about 
/)H 7 to 9. With still higher concentrations of alkali a yellow or brown 
color develops. 

If red cabbage is served raw with a salad dressing containing acid it is 
bright red or blue-red in color. If cooked in distilled water, it is violet 
or violet-blue in color, but often becomes blue after standing a few min- 
utes. With a slightly alkaline water the color is blue, for the plant acids 
lower the />H of the water. If the water is distinctly alkaline the color 
becomes green if cooked about 15 minutes or longer. The addition of a 
little soda to distilled water, Experiment 17B, 5, gives a green color unless 
the cooking period is exceptionally short. The red vegetables tend to retain 



120 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

their color better when cooked in milk than when cooked In water. Red 
onions show the same color changes as red cabbage, but the colors are often 
muddy. Red cabbage shows color changes in handling it. When the cut 
edges of the cabbage come in contact with the hands or knife they turn 
blue. Hands and knives washed in hard water or with soap may have 
salts with an alkaline reaction on their surface, but the anthocyanins can 
also form compounds with metallic ions. 

Beets do not develop the blue or green color, although the color often 
contains a considerable amount of blue or purple. Sometimes they turn 
from red to yellow when cooked. If the cooked beets are placed in acid, 
the red color is often restored after a short time. Blair states that beets 
contain two pigments, one being scarlet the other purple. The scarlet 
pigment is stable to heat, but the purple one fades. The scarlet pigment 
is stable even in the alkaline range as far as pH 9 or, according to Pratt 
and Swartout, even at pH 13.0. The color of canned or cooked beets 
depends upon the proportion of the two pigments present in the beets. 
This is probably an explanation of why cooked beets vary so much in 
color, even when cooked under the same conditions of acidity, temperature, 
and time. Beets have been produced in which the scarlet pigment has been 
increased and which do not lose color when canned at high temperatures. 

Metals and anthocyan pigments. The tin salts of the anthocyanins have 
been mentioned, but the iron salts are even better known. In general, the 
iron salts of anthocyanins are blue. It is known that juice from blue 
hydrangeas contains a higher percentage of iron than that from pink 
hydrangeas even at the same pH. Some anthocyanins may not combine 
with iron or other modifications may occur which prevent or are necessary 
for the development of the blue color, for if some anthocyanins are treated 
with iron salts the color fades or remains red. Other metals which may 
combine with the anthocyanins are aluminum, zinc, and lead. Aluminum 
produces about the same colors as iron, although less intense. It seems 
reasonable to expect that, if certain salts are present in the vegetable in high 
concentration or are furnished by the cooking water or the cooking utensil, 
they will modify colors obtained at a given pH in cooking. Also, the blue 
color that develops on the cut surface of red cabbage in a short time after 
cutting with a metal knife may possibly be due to formation of anthocyanin 
salts with the metal. 

Lathrop states that both iron and tin are "injurious to fruit pigments. 
The compounds of the pigments with the metals become quickly oxidized 
on exposure to air, with a marked increase in intensity of discoloration. Tin 
turns grapes, cherries, raspberries, and blackberries a deep purple and straw- 
berries a pale red. Iron produces dull brownish discolorations. Copper and 
aluminum are far less injurious and are therefore used wherever fruit must 
come in contact with metal. Copper being somewhat injurious to the color 
of grape, aluminum is usually used with grape." 

The application of this knowledge comes in cooking fruits, preserves. 



REACTIONS OF THE TANNINS 121 

and jellies. Since tin cooking utensils are seldom used in household cooking, 
this metal would be injurious to color of fruits when used in taking seeds 
from berries with tin colanders, or when such fruits are canned in un- 
lacquered tin. Iron might affect the color of fruits, if such fruits are 
cooked in utensils from which the enamel has been chipped. 

Tannins 

The term tannin is sometimes used to denote a whole group of substances 
having certain characteristics in common. Sometimes it is used to denote 
a particular substance, i.e., gallotanic or digallic acid. The former is the 
meaning used in the following paragraphs. 

The tannins are widely distributed in the higher plants. Some plants 
are very rich in them; others contain very little. The amount in the plant 
will vary with different years and growing conditions. The tannins are 
found throughout the plant, but the woody part, the stems, and rootstocks 
are likely to contain larger amounts. They are found in many fruits, espe- 
cially during the immature or green stages, and in the seeds of several plants. 
Lathrop states that stemming of grapes prior to heating for juice extraction 
is advisable to get rid of astringent tannin of the stems which would be 
detrimental to flavor. 

To some extent the tannin content of fruit is not only dependent upon 
environmental influences, but upon inherited characteristics. The New York 
Experiment Station has reported a variety of peach called Sunbeam, which 
does not turn brown when pared. Kertesz reports its tannin content as 
very low, 0.0076 per cent. 

Reactions of the tannins. Thatcher states that chemically the "Tan- 
nins are either free phenol-acids, or, more commonly, glucosides of these 
acids." The structure of the tannins is very similar to that of the anthocyan 
pigments. They are divided into two general classes, known as the pyro- 
gallol tannins and the catechol tannins. Thatcher has reported the following 
characteristic reactions. 

Pyrogallol Variety Catechol Variety 

Ferric salts Dark blue Greenish black 

Bromine water No precipitate Yellow or brown 

precipitate 

Leather Produces bloom No bloom 

Concentrated sulfuric acid Yellow or brown Red or Pink 

Lime water Gray or blue Pink or brown 

precipitate precipitate 

Haas and Hill summarize the properties of the tannins under eight 
headings. Only five will be given here. 

1. Tannins are mostly uncrystallizable colloidal substances with as- 
tringent properties. 



122 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

2. They give blackish-blue or blackish-green colors with ferric salts, 

a fact made use of in the manufacture of ink. 

3. In alkaline solution the tannins and many of their derivatives readily 

absorb oxygen becoming dark in color. 

4. They precipitate gelatin from solution and form insoluble compounds 

w^ith gelatin-yielding tissues, a property which enables them to 
convert hide into leather. 

5. They are precipitated from solution by many metallic salts such as 

copper or lead acetates, or stannous chloride. 

Astringent qualities due to tannins. The astringent properties give 
a slightly bitter taste to some foods, the degree depending on the amount 
of tannins present. Thatcher states that "Tannins are of frequent occur- 
rence in green fruits imparting to them their characteristic taste. They 
nearly always disappear as the fruit ripens." Two explanations are sug- 
gested for the disappearance of the tannins in ripening fruit. The anthocyan 
pigments may be derived from the tannins, so that as the fruit colors the 
tannins disappear ; or the tannins may be changed into an insoluble form 
and therefore are not so apparent to the taste. 

Persimmons contain a very large amount of tannin. Green persimmons 
have a bitter, astringent, puckery taste, that is not easily forgotten, once 
they have been tasted. Gore's work has shown that most of the tannin of 
persimmons is enclosed in cells, which he terms giant tannin cells. By arti- 
ficial processing in carbon dioxide, or by ripening, the membrane containing 
the tannins becomes hard and insoluble so that the astringent taste is not 
evident. 

Blue or purple discoloration in English walnuts. English walnuts 
are more astringent than other nuts and often develop color changes that 
are unattractive when combined with other foods. When they are combined 
with apples in a salad they often develop a blackish blue or purple color. 
This may come from having prepared the apples with an iron knife, the 
acid and enzyme of the fruit acting on the iron to produce ferric salts. 
When this small amount of ferric salt comes in contact with the tannin of 
the nut and particularly with the skin the purplish color develops. In nut 
bread, English walnuts often produce a dark color. 

Tannins may produce a gray shade in sugar. Zerban has found 
that the color of dark greenish cane juice, which produces a sugar with 
a gray shade, may be due to tannins, oxidizing enzymes, and iron. When 
the cane is crushed the acid of the juice forms some ferrous salts with the 
iron of the roller. Oxidizing enzymes of the juice oxidize the ferrous salts 
to ferric ones and they combine with the tannins of the juice. A similar 
change occurs when fruits are pared with iron knives and especially when 
the juice is left to stand on the knife and it darkens. 

Tannins and discolorations in canned goods. Kohman has reported 
that the discoloration, a darkening in color, often found in spots in canned 



ENZYMES 123 

sweet potatoes is due to tannins. The tannin combines with the iron of the 
can to produce the dark color. Oxygen is necessary to oxidize the ferrous 
iron to ferric, so that, unless oxygen is found in the can, either through not 
exhausting all of the air in processing or to a leak in the can, the dis- 
coloration does not occur. 

Salsify probably contains large amounts of tannic substances. It turns 
dark when peeled even if put under water unless a little vinegar is added 
to the water to acidify it. Salsify or oyster plant and sometimes other 
vegetables such as carrots stain the fingers when they are pared. This may 
be due in part to tannins. Lemon juice is effective in removing or lightening 
such stains because of its acidity. 

Other discolorations with tannins. Brownish or black discolorations 
of vegetables in vinegar have been caused by the tannin of the vinegar 
combining with the iron of the food. The use of a tannin-free vinegar 
does away with this difficulty. Greenish black spots in chocolate ice cream 
were traced to the tannin supplied by the chocolate or cocoa and the iron 
from rusty spots in the can. In green-colored beer the iron came from 
exposed pipes, the tannin from the hops. 

According to Atwater, cherry juice, now commercially marketed, when 
mixed with gelatin for a molded dessert, sometimes gave a gummy, purplish 
precipitate. The precipitate was caused from combination of the tannin of 
the juice with the protein, gelatin; the purplish color came from combina- 
tion with metals. 

Discoloration of pared fruit, considered at greater length in the next 
section, is caused by tannin compounds in combination with enzyme action. 

Tea. Black tea is darker than green tea because of oxidation of tannins 
in the leaf during drying and fermentation. It is also less astringent than 
green tea because the tannins are in a less soluble form. 

Tannins also give precipitates of calcium, magnesium, and iron tannates, 
when these minerals are present .in the water. The film on coffee or tea is 
from these tannates. When lemon or orange is added to tea, the film usu- 
ally disappears, for in acid the tannins often lose the darker color acquired 
in an alkaline medium. 

Tannins lower the surface tension of water, and the water in which 
vegetables containing tannins are cooked is apt to froth or foam. 

Enzymes 

Enzymes control many of the complex chemical processes of plant metab- 
olism. They accelerate reactions which would otherwise take place very 
slowly, and though they may initiate the reaction, do not form part of its 
final product. Reactions of several enzymes have been mentioned. A large 
number of the enzymes are hydrolytic, including the proteinases, lipases, 
amylases, and others; but there are also oxidizing and reducing and other 
groups of enzymes. Some of the plant enzymes that digest proteins are 



124 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

of slight interest in cookery. An enzyme of the pitcher-plant hydrolyzes 
fibrin. Bromelin of pineapple acts on native proteins, its effect being more 
often noticed in cookery when uncooked pineapple is added to gelatin, 
which is liquefied. Papain of the papaw leaf acts on native proteins. Some 
experiments were tried at the Office of Home Economics to utilize the 
papaw leaf, the dried powdered leaf, or the extracted enzyme to render 
tough meat tender. These did not indicate that papain could be successfully 
used in this way, as the enzyme acted on the surface, powdering or pul- 
verizing it in only a thin layer even after being in contact with the meat 
for several hours, the interior of the meat not being affected. 

Oxidizing enzymes. The oxidizing enzymes are concerned with the 
processes of oxidation and reduction in the plant cells. They are the cause 
of some of the brown color changes in fruits and vegetables when they are 
bruised or pared. The principal enzymes that produce the color changes 
are the peroxidases, the oxidases (classed as laccases or phenolases by some 
authors), and tyrosinase. The internal browning of fruits when injured 
involves oxidation as a primary step. But the oxidation requires peroxide 
oxygen. 

Peroxidases will decompose hydrogen peroxide giving "active" (atomic) 
oxygen. They are practically always present in the cells of the higher plants. 

Onslow states that fruits and vegetables containing only peroxidases do 
not brown when injured. She reports the following of the oxidases. The 
oxidases are present in about 63 per cent of the higher plants. A plant 
oxidase is made up of three components : ( 1 ) An enzyme, termed oxy- 
genase, (2) an aromatic substance containing an ortho-dihydroxy grouping 
such as that in catechol, and (3) a peroxidase. 



\ 

Catechol 



OH 



OH 



There may be several 'substances with the catechol grouping, i.e., two 
hydroxyl groups in the ortho position, found in plants. If the substances 
with the catechol grouping are present in plant tissue, but enzymes are not 
present, browning of the tissue in injury takes place slowly, but with 
oxygenase and peroxidase oxidation occurs rapidly and the material turns 
brown on injury. Onslow has reported that apples, apricots, cherries, grapes, 
figs, mulberries, pears, plums, peaches, potatoes, and strawberries all con- 
tain oxidases. Bananas sometimes contain substances with the catechol 
grouping, and sometimes they are absent from the flesh but are found in 
the skin. Oranges, lemons, limes, and raspberries do not contain all three 



PREVENTION OF BROWNING 125 

components of the oxidase system, and the following contain only a peroxi- 
dase: blackberries, pineapple, melon, and tomatoes. 

Zerban found that the polyphenols in cane juice may be oxidized by 
enzymes to a brown color, and to a less extent tyrosin may be oxidized 
by tyrosinase, giving a dark color. 

Discoloration in pared foods. Pared potatoes, apples and some other 
foods will turn dark unless cooked or put under water. The cooking de- 
stroys the enzymes, and putting under water prevents the oxygen of the 
air from coming in contact with the food. This darkening may be due to 
tannic substances which contain a catechol group or oxidases or both. It may 
also be due to the flavone and anthocyan pigments, as many of them show the 
black reaction typical of tannins since they have the same chemical linkage. 

Fresh peaches, pears, apricots, apples, bananas, etc., that are to be used 
for a salad and would lose sugar if kept in water may be pared six to 
eight hours before serving and kept from turning brown by being dipped 
in lemon or pineapple juice and put away in a covered fruit jar. 

Although the writer has used lemon and pineapple juice for years to 
prevent discoloration of freshly pared fruits, the reason for this, other 
than increased acidity, which did not entirely explain the results (pine- 
apple juice was less acid and more efficient than lemon juice), was not 
known until the work of Balls and Hale was published. 

Cruess, Mark, and Quinn state that the oxidase of peaches is not all 
destroyed by blanching at 120° to 160°F., thus causing internal browning 
with the formation of crescent shaped areas often seen in sliced peaches. 
To destroy the action of the oxidase of large peach halves requires heating 
for 10 minutes at 180° to 200°F. These investigators state that fruit 
acids such as citric and tartaric are not so effective as hydrochloric acid in 
retarding browning. Oxidation was completely held in check by 0.25 per 
cent of hydrochloric acid, so that this concentration on the surface of the 
peach would prevent browning. Salt and other chlorides will check brown- 
ing temporarily; but, after standing in a 2-per cent salt brine, the fruit 
must be rinsed to remove the flavor of salt. 

Prevention of browning by reducing substances. Joslyn and 
Marsh state that the primary oxidation step may be prevented by removal 
of oxygen or the addition of reducing substances. And without oxidation 
browning does not occur. Sulfites and stannous salts are good reducing 
substances. Sulfur dioxide has been used for many years to prevent dis- 
coloration. They state that orange juice does not brown at high or low 
temperatures when stored in tin cans. The reason given is absence of 
oxygen and the reducing action of stannous salts. The addition of ferrous 
salts in concentrations of 25 parts per million to the orange juice increased 
browning. Ferrous salts were more effective than ferric salts. Nickel, 
copper, or stannic salts were without effect, but stannous salts and sulfites 
protected against browning. However, after these salts were oxidized, 



126 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

then browning of the juice could occur. The addition of analine or trypto- 
phane caused immediate browning. 

Balls and Hale found that sulfhydryl compounds, some of which occur 
in common foods, prevent browning of apples. Gluthathione and cystein 
prevent darkening of the apples even when applied in very dilute concen- 
tration. Pineapple juice contains a sulfhydryl compound which is the cause 
for its inhibition of development of brown color. 

Oxidation and color loss. A type of oxidation that causes fading of 
red fruits in canning is explained by Kohman and Sandborn. All fruits and 
vegetables use oxygen in respiration, and some oxygen is found within the 
fruit or vegetable. The color of strawberries is deadened if they are heated 
very rapidly after refrigeration, during which the respiratory processes 
have been inhibited. However, if they are heated slowly so that the interior 
oxygen is used in respiration the color remains bright. 

Sulfur Compounds of Plants 

Sulfur compounds are present in the plant in three forms : in the amino 
acids of proteins, i.e., cystine, methionine, and others ; volatile compounds ; 
and sulfates. 

It is known that a portion of the protein sulfur is readily split off at 
boiling or higher temperatures. Peterson found volatile sulfur in clover, 
beet tops, blue grass, and milk. This was unexpected, and he suggests that 
it may come from two sources, volatile sulfur compounds in the materials 
used, or from the. splitting off of sulfur from the protein and the formation 
of hydrogen sulfide. He thinks the latter the more probable explanation. 
He found a larger percentage of volatile sulfur compounds in plants grown 
in a sulfur-rich soil than in those grown in a sulfur-poor soil. 

Volatile sulfur compounds. The volatile sulfur compounds are 
found in the plants as glucosides. When treated with acid or alkali and 
when acted upon by enzymes, these glucosides yield a sugar or some closely 
allied carbohydrate and one or more other substances, frequently phenols, 
allyl sulfide, or allyl isothiocyanate. Most of the investigations of sulfur- 
splitting enzymes have been made upon myrosin. The strong flavor of old 
or stored turnips, rutabagas, and cabbage is probably largely due to setting 
free of sulfur compounds by enzymes. When they are cooked, plant acids 
are liberated which cause hydrolysis of the volatile sulfur compounds. In 
addition, hydrogen sulfide is formed by decomposition of the sulfur com- 
pounds by heat. 

The odor of many of these compounds is familiar, those of onions and 
garlic, cooking cabbage, etc., being typical examples. 

Allyl isothiocyanate is found in mustard seed. It is prepared commer- 
cially by macerating the seed, the enzyme then splitting off the sulfur of 
the glucoside. The oil is then obtained by distillation with steam. Allyl 



SULFUR COMPOUNDS 127 

sulfide IS found in the onion family, and is prepared commercially from 
garlic. The strong flavor of onions, leeks, and garlic depends upon the 
concentration of allyl sulfide. 

These volatile compounds escape from the food more rapidly with rise 
in temperature and breakdown of the plant cells. Hence, the longer onions, 
leeks, and garlic are cooked the milder their flavor becomes. Also because 
finely minced onion has a greater surface area for volatilization to occur 
than when cut in large pieces, these substances volatilize more rapidly 
from finely cut pieces. This is why it is preferable to add onion juice, very 
finely minced onion, or cooked onion to some foods that are not cooked 
long or that do not reach a high temperature, such as hamburger or stuff- 
ing for fowl or meat. Large pieces of raw onion in a stuffing produce a 
very strong onion flavor, more concentrated in some areas than others, 
instead of a subtle, well-blended flavor, for the stuffing never reaches boil- 
ing temperature. 

The amount of onion and/or garlic added, the fineness of division of 
the pieces, and the length of cooking all affect the flavor of the finished 
product to which they are added. The flavor of a food like catsup or chili 
sauce may be ruined by adding a large quantity of onion or garlic in large 
pieces near the end of the cooking process. The same amount of onion 
or garlic added in small pieces, or added in large pieces early in the cook- 
ing process, could blend with, instead of dominate, the flavor of the other 
ingredients. 

Sulfur compounds and the cooking o£ vegetables. It is com- 
monly known that long cooking of some vegetables such as cabbage, turnips, 
cauliflower, and Brussels sprouts develops strong, disagreeable flavors, and 
the eating of these vegetables may cause discomfort and digestive dis- 
turbances. The longer cooking and stronger flavor are accompanied by 
increased acidity of the vegetable. The length of time of cooking for the 
strong flavor to develop varies with the vegetable, whether the cooking is 
started in cold or boiling water, and the proportion of vegetable to water. 

Simpson and Halliday have determined the total volatile sulfur and 
hydrogen sulfide evolved when cabbage and cauliflower are cooked for 
different lengths of time. They found that the most acceptable product is 
obtained when winter cabbage is boiled 7 to 8 minutes, and spring cabbage 
5 minutes. Cauliflower required 8 minutes to become tender. They con- 
clude that with prolonged cooking the decomposition products of sulfur 
compounds increase, and that these products produce the strong taste and 
odor associated with cabbage and cauliflower. 

Simpson and Halliday report that the amount of hydrogen sulfide in- 
creases from the fifth to the twentieth minute of boiling cabbage, and the 
total volatile sulfur between the seventh and thirtieth minutes. Cauliflower 
gives off more volatile substances in the same period than cabbage. Masters 
and Garbutt have found that the amount of sulfide increases up to a cer- 



128 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

tain point and then decreases, becoming fairly constant. Kohman states that 
in corn the amount of hydrogen sulfide evolved is greater during the first 
half hour and decreases with each succeeding half hour. 

Shilling in determining the amount of hydrogen sulfide formed in cook- 
ing cabbage finds that it varies from 1 to 7 milligrams per 300 grams of 
fresh cabbage. The wide variation depends upon the amount of green 
compared with the white, the speed of cooking, the length of time of 
cooking, and the temperature involved in the method, i.e., boiling in water 
and the pressure cooker. 

Bigelow has reported that the black spotting on the corn around the 
edges of the can in canned corn is due to the formation of hydrogen sulfide 
in processing. The am.ount of sulfide is very small and there is no objection 
to it except from appearance. Stevenson states that iron sulfide is formed 
to a greater extent in canned peas than in canned corn. It is not so notice- 
able in peas on account of their color. In peas it is deposited as scales that 
break up easily in shipping and handling. 

Flavor 

The flavors of fruits and vegetables are due to several constituents, sugar, 
organic acids, mineral salts, and aromatic compounds. 

Sugar is found in fruits and vegetables. Beets, carrots, onions, peas, and 
other vegetables contain appreciable amounts. In vegetables like peas and 
corn the sugar is deposited as the insoluble carbohydrate, starch, in the 
mature seed. Immature peas and corn deteriorate rapidly in sugar content 
after they are gathered. Kertesz reports that starch increases and sugar 
decreases in stored fresh peas, but the sugar loss is not due to the trans- 
formation of sugar to starch. It is suggested that the apparent increase of 
starch content is because of loss of other constituents; and, whereas the 
loss of the sugar is not satisfactorily clarified, it may be consumed in 
respiration. Losses in sugar content can be prevented by inactivation of 
the respiratory enzymes by blanching, cooking, or storing near freezing 
temperatures. 

The vegetables with a fairly high sugar content usually have a sweeter 
flavor if steamed or if just enough water is used to cook them and it is 
evaporated to dryness at the end of the cooking period. Even mild-flavored 
onions may be sweeter and better flavored if the water is evaporated than 
when an excess is left. But there seem to be some exceptions to most rules, 
and the choice of method of cooking is often a matter of judgment or 
circumstance. More could be written about flavor, but it has been men- 
tioned so often in connection with different constituents of fruits and 
vegetables that a great deal would be repetition. 

A combination of sugar, acids, and aromatic substances gives flavors that 
render fruits and vegetables palatable and attractive food products. 



EFFECTS OF ALKALIES, ACIDS, AND CALCIUM 129 

Aromatic compounds. This classification is not given as a plant 
chemistry one, but as a group to include all substances that may give 
characteristic odor and thus flavor to foods. 

Many of the aromatic compounds are esters, like amyl acetate, which 
gives a characteristic odor to pears and is called *'pear oil." The odor of 
pineapple is due to methylbutyrate, w^hich is designated "pineapple-oil." 
Isoamyl isovalerate produces the characteristic odor of apples. 

Thatcher includes all the substances that give characteristic odor to 
plants under the term "essential oils and resins." Some of these substances 
are terpenes, alcohols derived from terpenes, the phenols, and sulfuretted 
oils. Oils of lemon, peppermint, cinnamon, clove, lavender, and others are 
classified as essential oils. 

AUyl isosulfocyanide, oil of mustard, and allyl sulfide, oil of garlic, con- 
stitute the best known of the oils containing sulfur. 

Tannins impart an astringent, bitter flavor to some foods. 

Cellulose 

Cellulose forms the structural, fiber, or woody part of the plant. Other 
substances such as pectic substances may occur in combination with cellu- 
lose. In the young plants or the new growth of older plants the cell walls 
are at first yielding. As they mature, they grow more resistant and may 
change physically and chemically, their function becoming more specialized 
with the occurring changes. In tree trunks some cell walls become woody 
or lignified. Doree and Barton-Wright state that the stone cells distributed 
throughout the flesh and particularly near the core of pears are lignified 
cellulose. 

Cellulose is a carbohydrate. It is found in plants in several forms. There 
is no unanimity of opinion regarding its definition, although the cotton fiber 
is always taken as a standard cellulose product. 

Hemlcellulose, wood cellulose, and gelatinized cellulose are names given 
to different forms of cellulose. Probably each group includes several prod- 
ucts. Schorger defines hemicellulose as "A polysaccharide soluble in dilute 
alkalies and convertible into simple sugars by heating with dilute acids 
at atmospheric pressure." He adds that a hemicellulose in the natural state 
should be insoluble in boiling water. 

Effects of alkalies, acids, and calcium on the structural or 
woody part of fruits and vegetables. Ammonia and sodium bicar- 
bonate added to the water in which vegetables are boiled, or ammonia or 
ammonium carbonate added to water in which vegetables are steamed, 
causes them to soften in a shorter time than if these substances had not 
been added. With longer cooking the vegetable becomes mushy and dis- 
integrates. The disintegration begins with the surface layer of the food, 
and its depth depends on the length of time of cooking and the size of 
the piece of food. 



130 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

If vinegar is added to the water in which vegetables are cooked the 
effect is opposite from that of sodium bicarbonate : a firmer and more solid 
texture is obtained and the vegetable requires longer to cook. In cooking 
vegetables like cabbage and spinach the amount of calcium and magnesium 
salts found in the water seems to have little effect upon the texture or the 
length of time for cooking. 

The pulp and white part of the rind of watermelon as well as the pulp 
of muskmelon or cantaloupe, and perhaps other foods, can be made very 
firm and brittle or woody if soaked in saturated calcium hydroxide (lime) 
water. The longer they are soaked the harder and firmer they become if 
the water is kept saturated with lime. Five to six hours' soaking is usually 
sufficient to produce enough firmness to prevent shriveling when cooked 
in sirups for preserves or pickle. The melon pulp may be cooked in water 
until transparent and tender, then put in lime water to harden, and finally 
cooked in a sirup. Or cooking first in only water does not prevent harden- 
ing of the pulp by calcium. The few times that cucumbers have been soaked 
in lime water either slight or no hardening occurred. But other calcium 
compounds such as calcium chloride do produce hardening in pickles. 

Pickles. Cucumber pickles are seldom made in class work; but why 
brined pickles spoil is a perennial question. Rahn has offered a solution of 
the difficulty. An abstract of his work follows. 

The inside of the cucumber is free of bacteria, but the brine into which 
the cucumbers are placed contains several thousand bacteria per cubic 
centimeter. There are many different kinds of bacteria present in the 
beginning but with the strength of brine maintained most of them die. 
However, a few kinds that thrive in the brine survive. Fresh brine con- 
tains no food for bacteria. But with placing of the pickles in brine, or the 
formation of brine by adding dry salt to cucumbers, small amounts of 
sugar and other bacterial food are dissolved from the cucumbers as they 
shrink. Hence bacteria that can tolerate salt grow and decompose the sugar. 
The resulting decomposition products of the sugar are acid and gas. The 
gas produces froth. The acid, probably mostly lactic, is very important, 
for the keeping of the pickles depends upon it. The concentration of the 
acid is rather high when frothing ceases, varying from 0.6 to 1.2 per cent. 
The acid is a fairly good disinfectant and practically all bacteria in the 
brine are killed. 

In addition to bacteria, yeasts are present in the brine; but because they 
need oxygen they grow principally on the surface. The scum yeast feed 
on the acid of the brine and decompose it, thus decreasing the quantity of 
acid in the tank or container. If scum grows long enough, all the acid is 
destroyed and then the pickles become slippery, soft, and mushy. It is better 
not to stir the pickles too much after they are in the brine, for the acid 
tends to stay at the bottom of the container and the yeasts grow at the 
surface. 



EFFECT OF SUGAR ON THE FIRMNESS OF FRUIT 131 

There are two periods when the acid is low, and these stages are the 
periods of greatest danger in fermenting pickles. The first stage is before 
fermentation has started and no or little acid has been formed ; the second 
is after the acid has been used up by scum yeast, for spoilage only occurs 
when the acidity of the brine is sufficiently low. The slipperiness and soft- 
ness are caused by so-called potato bacteria, which resist the salt well 
but do not tolerate acid. Because oxygen is necessary for their growth and 
the bacteria only grow at the surface, the pickles protruding from the brine 
become soft. These potato bacteria can cause great loss and damage before 
a concentration of acid great enough to delay their growth is formed. 
A single potato bacterium, if all conditions are favorable, produces from 
10 to 100 million new bacteria in 24 hours. 

Hence, to prevent spoilage all pickles should be kept under the brine. 
Some acid or vinegar can be added with the brine to prevent spoilage. 
It has been interesting to see that this has been advocated for commercial 
practise since Rahn's work was published. Other methods of preventing 
growth of the yeast are to keep the container in the sunlight or irradiate 
with ultra-violet light, both of which are not practical in the home. After 
fermentation is complete, that is, after frothing has ceased, oil or paraffin 
may be used over the surface of the brine. Since the oil is rather difficult 
to wash from the pickles, paraffin is preferable. 

Crisping pickles. Calcium chloride is used to make pickles crisp or firm. 
It is used either in the last soaking water, when the brine is being removed, 
or added directly to the sweetened vinegar. The proportion used is one 
pound per barrel of pickles. 

The hardening may come from the calcium combining with the cellulose 
or it may combine with acid of the pickle or melon or be deposited as 
calcium salts in the food. Some factors other than the ones mentioned may 
cause the hardening. 

The effect of sugar on the firmness of fruit. The effect of sugar 
of course varies somewhat with the amount used in proportion to the 
quantity of fruit. Osmosis occurs when a sirup has greater sugar concentra- 
tion than that of the fruit to which it is added. The vapor pressure of 
the sirup solution is lower than that of the fruit so that water passes 
from the fruit to the sirup. This transfer from a region of high concen- 
tration to a low one is called osmosis. If a membrane separates the regions 
of high and low concentrations it is dependent upon the membrane whether 
all the dissolved constituents of a solution can pass through the membrane. 
With a semi-permeable membrane only the water can pass through the 
membrane. Without discussing the possible role of the membrane in osmosis 
or the osmotic pressure that may be produced, it is sufficient for the purpose 
here to state that as the permeability of the membrane increases larger 
and larger ions or molecules dissolved in the water may pass through the 
membrane. The skin and cell walls of the fruit serve as membranes. These 



132 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

membranes in the different fruits seem to have a greater or a lesser permea- 
bility to sugar. 

When cooked in a sirup some fruits tend to keep their shape, some be- 
come mushy, some shrivel, and others tend to collapse or flatten out. For 
instance, sweet apples tend to stay whole whether cooked in sirup or in 
water, whereas sour apples have a greater tendency to break up during 
cooking. In general, the fruits tend to stay whole better if cooked in a 
sirup. For purees the fruit is cooked in water and the sugar added later. 
Cooking seems in most instances to increase the permeability of the fruit 
membranes to sugar. Some apples, some plums, and most berries can be 
cooked directly in the sirup without noticeable toughening of the fruit. 
Peaches, apricots, most apples, and most plums absorb sugar satisfactorily. 
Lathrop states that the firm texture of the cherry skin and of the peach 
and blackberry flesh retards penetration of the sugar during cooking. On the 
other hand, a fruit like Keifer pears is dehydrated if cooked directly in a 
sirup and becomes shriveled, tough, hard, and rubbery. It is necessary to 
soften the fruit by cooking and increase its permeability to sugar before 
the sugar is added. It is of course possible that many changes other than 
increasing the permeability of the fruit to sugar occur when the fruit is 
cooked in sirup. Later work has shown that fruit like Keifer pears and 
quinces can be cooked by adding the sugar directly to them without pre- 
liminary cooking. But it is necessary to start with an excess of thin sirup 
and cook slowly to evaporate the excess liquid, as the sugar penetrates the 
fruit. So long a time is required that the method is not practical. The fruit 
becomes more transparent in appearance. It may be that the sugar has 
some effect on the cellulose. 

In fruits like strawberries and seeded sour cherries, and particularly if 
they are heated rapidly in a sugar sirup, flattening occurs. If a large number 
of cell walls are broken the fruit becomes mushy. Time is required for 
sugar to pass through the cell walls of fruits. If osmosis has not progressed 
far enough, i.e., if the concentration of the sugar within the berry is not as 
great as in the sirup surrounding it, the berry floats when canned. 

In pickling, shriveling can be prevented by heating the pickling material 
slightly and increasing the concentration of the sugar gradually, allowing 
about 24 hours or more to elapse before the next addition of sugar. But 
fermentation is more likely to occur when preserves are treated this way. 
It is a good practise to add the sugar directly to fruits like strawberries 
and cherries and let them stand over night. The fruit loses water, shrinks 
somewhat, and becomes slightly tougher. When heated slowly, and if neces- 
sary removed from the heat for a few minutes before boiling commences, 
there is time for the sugar to penetrate into the interior of the berry, the 
fruit is plump and will not float when placed in the container. In the 
commercially vacuum-processed berries, floating in the can is prevented by 
adding the berries, to which part of the sugar has previously been added, 
to a hot sirup, but further heating is not continued until the berries have 



SOME INVESTIGATIONS ON POTATO QUALITY 133 

stood for a few minutes. By producing a vacuum, the greater pressure 
within the berry tends to puff it up; by breaking the vacuum, flattening 
occurs. In this way the process of osmosis is helped. 

Strawberries and the sour cherries develop a strong flavor when boiled 
for a long time. Hence time must be allowed for the sugar to penetrate 
into the fruit before the boiling point is reached. Boiling should be rapid, 
and the quantity of fruit used in a batch small. The popularity of sun 
preserves for certain fruits is due to osmosis being slow and complete. 
If the fruit is heated the heating period is very short, so that strong flavors 
are not developed, less sugar is inverted and caramelized, and the aromatic 
substances are not lost to such an extent as in long cooking. 

Since strawberries usually contain about 90 per cent water, it seems a 
better practise to add the sugar directly to the berries, for not as long a 
time is required to cook the berries to the concentration desired. When 
water is added to the sugar to make a sirup it is necessary to evaporate the 
water used in the sirup as well as a part of that contained in the fruit. 
Increasing the proportion of sugar to fruit also lessens the time required 
to reach a definite concentration of the sirup, so that the preserves do 
not develop as strong a flavor. When 1^ pounds of sugar are used with 
a pound of strawberries only a short time of cooking is required for the 
sirup to reach a temperature of 103°C., which gives a sirup containing 60 
per cent of sugar. See Table 10. 

Potatoes 

What constitutes quality in potatoes? For baking and boiling it is 
usually accepted that the best potatoes are those that yield a white, com- 
paratively dry, and mealy texture. The homemaker does not like for 
boiling a potato that sloughs off badly during cooking, though this often 
occurs with some of the best baking potatoes. For deep-fat frying, dicing 
for salad, and other purposes a potato that gives a waxy and firm con- 
sistency is considered best. 

Some investigations on potato quality. It is rather commonly be- 
lieved that to have mealy potatoes the starch content should be high and 
that the swelling and bursting of cell walls during cooking produces the 
white, fairly dry, flaky appearance. Sweetman states that the starch grains 
do not swell sufficiently to burst but the cooking renders the starch 
granules readily separable. That ease of cell separation is one of the 
causes of mealiness is unsubstantiated by other investigators. Whittemore 
and Juschke decided that potatoes were more mealy when fertilized with a 
high rather than a low quantity of potash (potassium carbonate). 

Cobb states that the parts of the tuber having the greatest concentration 
of starch are mealiest when cooked. The rank in descending order is cortex, 
external medulla, and internal medulla. Cobb in a series of investigations 
covering 5 years found that baking gave more mealy potatoes than boiling. 



134 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

Baked potatoes often lost 25 per cent of their weight by evaporation, 
whereas boiled ones lost none. 

Environmental factors. Cobb concluded that if proper cultural con- 
ditions were given any type of soil may grow good potatoes. His studies 
showed that temperature during growing and variety were the most 
important factors affecting potato quality. A low-average temperature 
favored better quality. This suggests that one reason why Maine and 
Idaho are noted for their potatoes is the low-average temperature during 
growth of the potatoes. Small, immature, or ill-shaped tubers were ob- 
served to have poor quality. 

Stevenson and Whitman state that a variety producing good-quality 
potatoes under certain conditions may produce poor ones under other condi- 
tions, but a good-cooking variety tends to maintain better quality over a 
wider range of conditions than a poor-cooking quality. 

Starch granules. It is possible that two factors determining whether 
a potato produces a mealy or waxy consistency when cooked are the size of 
the starch granule and its phosphorus content. See Starch, Chapter XL 
Large granules swell and gelatinize at a lower temperature than small 
granules. Thus, potatoes giving a dry, mealy texture may have a compara- 
tively larger percentage of large granules. Smaller granules are supposed 
to have a higher phosphorus content than large ones, and the paste-forming 
qualities of starch are increased when the starch is combined with phos- 
phorus. If paste-forming qualities mean increased adhesiveness, then waxy 
potatoes may have either smaller granules or a higher phosphorus content 
or both. 

Storage temperature. Wright et al. found that the storage tempera- 
ture affected the quality of the cooked potatoes. They stored Irish Cobbler 
potatoes harvested August 3 for 8 weeks at the following temperatures: 
^2"", 36°, 40°, 50°, 60°, and 70°F. In general potatoes stored at 40° 
were considered fair in quality when cooked; those from storage at 32° 
and 36° were poor; those from 50° good; those from 60° very good, 
and those from 70° good. The baked and boiled products from potatoes 
stored at 40° were slightly sweet and watery; those from 36° storage were 
inclined to be soggy or watery, with a distinctly yellow color and sweet 
flavor; those from storage at 50°, 60°, and 70° possessed no undesirable 
sweet flavor and were of mealy texture and cream in color. 

Potato chips. The most important factor in making potato chips ap- 
pears to be the sugar content of the potato. With a high sugar content the 
chips become too brown, with production of a more or less disagreeable 
astringent flavor, before they are suflSciently cooked. The concentration of 
sugar increases in potatoes stored at a low temperature. At ordinary tem- 
peratures the sugar is used up in respiration ; at lower temperatures metab- 
olism is retarded but sugar production by enzymes proceeds, so that sugar 
accumulates. 



COOKING OF DRIED LEGUMES 135 

Peacock and Brunstetter have reported a very simple test for predeter- 
mining the cooking value of potatoes because of accumulated sugars. One 
cubic centimeter of a saturated aqueous solution of picric acid and 1 
cubic centimeter of a 20-per cent sodium carbonate solution are placed in a 
test tube. To this is added a piece of potato of definite length cut with a 
cork borer. The solution is heated carefully to prevent boiling over for 
1 minute. If the solution does not become much darker it indicates that 
the potato has little sugar and is suitable for both chips and "French 
fries." With increasing sugar content the solution becomes darker and 
darker when time of heating and size of piece of potato are kept stand- 
ardized. The darkest shade given by Peacock and Brunstetter is a dark 
garnet-brown; but Swalley tested some potatoes that gave shades two 
degrees darker in color than dark garnet-brown, the darkest being nearly 
black. Potato slices fried for a definite time in fat at a definite tempera- 
ture become browner and browner as the sugar content increases and give 
perfect correlations with the picric acid test. In general Swalley found 
that the longer the potatoes were stored at 32°F. (storage was from 
11-14 to 12-15), the longer the time required for storage at room tempera- 
ture (those stored at 32° for 31 days required 45 days at room tempera- 
ture) before good chips were obtained. 

Wright et al. found that potatoes stored at 32° and 36° were not suitable 
for French fries, as they browned too quickly and had a burned flavor. 
To some extent this was also true of potatoes stored at 40°. As the storage 
temperature increased the time necessary for cooking increased. Potatoes 
stored at 60° and 70° gave fries of attractive golden-brown color, mealy 
texture, and good flavor. Similar results were obtained with chips. 

Preparation o£ chips. Because it is difficult or impossible to slice the 
potatoes evenly by hand, they should be cut with a slicer. If salt is added 
to the soaking water the slices are partially dehydrated during the soak- 
ing; thus a shorter time is required for cooking and no addition of salt 
is necessary after cooking. For %. pound of potato and J4 cup of water 
about 8 grams of salt are required. 

Cooking chips. The cooking time and temperature are dependent to a 
certain extent on the quantity of potatoes added to a given amount of fat. 
For % pound of slices about 3 minutes are required when the initial 
temperature of the fat is 190°C. and the quantity of fat is about 2 to 
2^ pounds. Smaller quantities of potatoes cook in a shorter time. The 
chips are done when bubbling of the fat ceases, which indicates the major 
portion of the water has evaporated. 

Cooking of Dried Legumes 

Different varieties of beans and peas belong to the legume family. The 
dried legumes commonly used for food are navy, lima, kidney, soy, other 



136 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

varieties of beans, lentils, and dried peas. The dried legumes contain less 
moisture than the fresh ones. In cooking, the moisture lost by drying is 
replaced and water is absorbed. The legume is softened. This requires a 
longer period than for fresh legumes, so that the methods of cooking that 
shorten the cooking process are more important than for fresh vegetables. 
Effect o£ mineral content of the water upon cooking of dried 
legumes. Huenink and Bartow in trying to determine why the quality 
of canned products from some factories was always superior to those of 
others found that the mineral content of the water affected the softening 
of dried beans in cooking. Using a sirup and distilled water in canning 
beans, they found the product very tender and one that would grade 
strictly fancy on the market. When to the sirup, distilled water, and beans, 
calcium chloride was added, using lots with 100, 200, 300, 400, 500, 600, 
and 1000 parts per million parts of water, the hardness of the processed 
beans increased with increasing calcium chloride, the ones with 1000 being 
nearly as hard as uncooked beans. The series with 100 to 200 parts of 
calcium chloride were hard and tough and would grade standard on the 
market and be called underprocessed. Continuing their work they tried 
the following salts : 

Calcium chloride CaCl2 

Calcium sulfate CaS04 

Calcium bicarbonate Ca(HC03)2 

Magnesium sulfate MgS04 

Magnesium bicarbonate Mg(HC03)2 

Sodium carbonate Na2C03 

Sodium bicarbonate NaHCOs 

They found that the calcium and magnesium salts hardened the beans 
whether as chlorides, sulfates, or carbonates. The calcium and magnesium 
bicarbonates had a hardening effect but the results were not as consistent 
as with the other salts. 

Both the sodium carbonate and sodium bicarbonate gave a softening 
effect, and with larger quantities the beans appeared over-cooked. 

The National Canners Association has reported that calcium and mag- 
nesium salts harden beans and peas during cooking, having a greater effect 
upon the beans than on the peas. String beans and corn do not seem to 
be affected, nor are beets affected up to 350 parts of magnesium or calcium 
per million parts of w^ater, but the salts of hard water combine with the 
soluble oxalates of the beet to give a white coat on the surface of the beet. 

Van der Marel, investigating the effect of various salts, bases, and acids 
upon the softening during cooking of dried peas, has reported the following 
results. Using a "good cooking" variety of peas, and cooking for 1^ hours 
he determined the percentage remaining hard at the end of the cooking 
period.

Van der Marel decided that the softening effect was due to action on 
the pectic substances of the peas and that anything that made the pectic 
substances more soluble had a softening effect in cooking. 

The results of Huenink and Bartow and of Van der Marel show why 
some waters are not desirable for cooking dry legumes. With increasing 
hardness of the water the hardening effect on the vegetable is more notice- 
able. Some housewives have found this out from experience. The writer 
remembers her grandmother's insisting that dried beans should be cooked 
in cistern water, because they cooked more quickly than in the well water 
which was permanently hard. 

Hard water. Hard water contains salts of calcium, magnesium, and 
sometimes iron. Hardness of water is designated as temporary or perma- 
nent. Water containing calcium and magnesium bicarbonates is termed 
temporary hard water since the heating of the bicarbonates decomposes 
them and carbonates are formed which are deposited as crusts on the inner 
part of the tea kettle or cooking utensil. Such waters are rendered less 



138 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

hard by boiling. Permanent hard water contains the sulfates of magnesium 
and calcium. Some water is both temporarily and permanently hard. 

Softened water, which is used a great deal at the present time, has the 
calcium and magnesium replaced by sodium. The author has noticed that, 
since softened water is used in the Home Economics building at Iowa 
State College, fresh green peas never become hard as they sometimes did 
with the old permanently hard water and that the difference between the 
time required for cooking dry beans not soaked and those that are soaked 
is very much shorter. 

The pectic substances o£ bean coats. Snyder noticed that if the seed 
coat of pea or Great Northern beans was injured or scarified, the beans 
swelled in soaking and cooked in a shorter time. Next she noticed that 
entrance of water into the beans is not uniform over the entire surface of 
the bean but most of the water entered through the micropyle and germinal 
area. Substances that dissolved the pectic substances shortened the soaking 
and cooking time. Beans with very hard skins neither soaked nor cooked 
satisfactorily and contained a higher percentage of pectic substances than 
skins of beans that soaked and cooked easily. The major portion of the 
calcium of beans was found in the seed coat. 

Snyder's results with calcium and magnesium salts, with acids, and with 
soda substantiate those of earlier investigators, with the exception that 
oxalic acid, which cannot be used in preparation of edible products, did 
not depress absorption of water. Oxalic acid would render the calcium 
salts insoluble. 

Snyder found that ^ teaspoon of soda per pint of water was sufficient 
for soaking to shorten the cooking time, except with one very hard water. 
If the beans were soaked in water at 120°F. the maximum amount of 
water was absorbed in 6 hours. Molasses and tomato juice had an effect 
similar to that of acids but could be added without injurious effect after 
the beans were cooked. Beans that cooked rapidly on top of a burner also 
baked satisfactorily. 

Masters's results with legumes. Masters, using London tap water 
(temporary hardness 12 parts per 100,000 parts of water and permanent 
hardness 5 parts per 100,000 parts of water) and cooking butter beans, 
found that soaking made little difference in time required for cooking, 
but that soaking with sodium bicarbonate in the soaking water did shorten 
the cooking time. Distilled water gave a shorter cooking time than tap 
water. Masters also determined the soaking and cooking losses of total 
solids. It is interesting to note that soaking with soda in the water gave 
not only a shorter cooking period, but also a slightly decreased loss of 
total solids. However, there was only a very slight difference. This was 
with the percentage of soda that she considered to give the best cooking 
results, 1 per cent (equivalent to about ^ teaspoon of soda per cup of 
water). With larger amounts of soda than 1 per cent, greater losses due 
to disintegration of the beans occurred. With a small amount, 0.25 per 



CLASS RESULTS WITH NAVY BEANS 139 

cent, the cooking time was shortened but the total loss of solids was slightly- 
higher than for the other methods of cooking. Losses were also high when 
large amounts of soda were used in the soaking instead of the cooking 
water. When other types of beans were substituted for the butter beans, 
the results were similar, although the cooking time might be longer or 
shorter according to the nature of the beans, and the cooking losses higher 
or lower, varying with the thickness of the skins of the beans. The loss of 
solids during cooking of the butter beans was about 10.5 to 11 per cent 
if beans were not soaked. If beans were soaked before cooking the total 
loss was about 12.5 per cent. 

One of the methods recommended by Masters for cooking beans is to 
add soda to the soaking water and salt to the cooking water. She found 
that discarding the soaking water gave no greater cooking losses than when 
it was retained and the beans cooked in the water in which they were 
soaked. 

Class results with navy beans. The experimental class results for 
several years at Iowa State College show that, although some navy beans 
cook in a very short time, the majority require about the same time, which 
is close to the average given in the following tables. Some require longer 
cooking. To show this the minimum and maximum time as well as the 
average are given in the tables. The beans were washed and added to 1 pint 
of boiling water. If the water evaporated to dryness, boiling water was 
added. The soaked beans stood over night, usually 15 to 24 hours. All the 
figures are for 15 or more tests. The water is quite hard, averaging about 
340 parts of carbonate per million parts of water. The mineral content 
as carbonate is as follows: 

CaCOs 240 parts per million parts of water. 
MgCOs 100 parts per million parts of water. 

For an end point in cooking the beans were cooked so that they would 
be as whole as possible yet soft all the way through. A common household 
way of testing when beans are done is to stick them with the point of a 
sharp knife or fork. This was the test used, but the experiments being done 
by students through different quarters give differences of opinion as to when 
the beans were done. For example, the minimum time for beans cooked 
with soda in tap water is shorter than the minimum time for beans soaked 
with soda in distilled water, but the averages are reversed. 

Soda may be added to the cooking water and not discarded. This was 
tried in class, but the beans became mushy on the outside and disintegrated 
while the center was still hard. 

In all varieties of beans, cooking with the vessel covered gives a shorter 
cooking period than cooking uncovered. This may be due to the cooling 
effect by evaporation of the water at the surface and possibly will not occur 
with a large quantity of beans and water.

Soaked beans are lighter in color and less strong in flavor than the 
non-soaked ones. 

Lima beans. Although the work with lima beans has been limited 
in extent in comparison to that done with navy beans the results have been 
similar to those obtained with the latter. 

Soaking to shorten the cooking period must continue until the beans have 
absorbed enough water to weigh nearly double their dry weight. When 
boiling water was poured over the lima beans and left to stand, swelling 
occurred more rapidly than when cold water was used. The time required 
for soaking with cold water is 7 to 8 hours or longer, but with the boiling 
water 4 to 5 hours is usually sufficient. 

Pinto beans. Greenwood found that the degree of hardness of the water 
is the most important factor to consider in cooking beans. Satisfactory 
results were obtained by any method with very soft water, and no method 
was entirely satisfactory with very hard water. Boiling water 20 to 30 
minutes to precipitate the calcium and magnesium salts before using for 
cooking the beans was beneficial. In using hard water better results were 
obtained if it was boiled gently and the vessel was well covered to avoid 
evaporation of water, thus preventing the necessity of adding more water 
and increasing the total salts added. For the shortest cooking period the 
beans should be soaked in hot soda water (0.5 per cent solution), 1^ tea- 
spoons to 5 cups of water. 

Dried soybeans. The use of soybeans for human consumption is con- 
stantly increasing, both the green and dry varieties being used to a greater 
extent than formerly. Some varieties are nearly impossible to cook but va- 
rieties easier to cook are used for edible purposes. 

Work with dry soybeans indicates that soaking over night in cold water 
nearly halves the cooking time. Addition of soda to the soaking water fur- 
ther shortens the cooking time. But pouring boiling water over the beans 
and letting them soak in this water for 3 or 4 hours results in the shortest 
cooking time.

150 FRUITS AND VEGETABLES 

1. To 1 cup of water add a cup of sugar. Bring to a boil. Pare and core 
6 apples. Do not cut in pieces. Cook in the sirup. The sirup should be in a 
rather small pan so that the apples are covered by the boiling sirup. Cook 
until the apples are translucent in appearance. It may be necessary to cook 
only a portion of the apples at a time. 

2. Peel and core 6 apples. Cut into quarters or eighths. For each 1^ pounds 
of peeled apples add 1 cup of water and cook until soft. When soft add % 
cup of sugar for each 1}^ pounds of pared apples. Compare with the consistency 
of the apples cooked under 1. 

B. To determine the effect of length of time of cooking upon the flavor and 
the proportion of sugar to fruit upon the texture of the fruit in strawberry 
preserves. 

1. Wash and stem strawberries. For each pound of fruit (approximately 
1 quart) add 1 pound of sugar and let stand in the refrigerator over night. 
When ready to cook place in a rather large sauce pan for the quantity of 
berries, so that they can boil rapidly without danger of boiling over the top of 
the pan. Heat slowly and shake the pan occasionally. When the temperature 
reaches 65° to 70°C. (150°F,) remove the pan from the heat and keep warm 
for about 5 minutes. Roll the berries occasionally in the sirup. Put over the 
heat and bring to a boil quickly. Cook until the temperature of the sirup 
registers 103°C. Let stand until the bubbles cease to form. Pour in sterilized 
containers. If the berries float to the top of the can repeat the experiment, 
increasing the time the fruit is held in the sirup at a temperature of 65°C. Let 
stand a few days before making comparisons with other preserves. Keep a 
record of the time required for cooking. 

2. Repeat 1, but for each pound of fruit add 1^^ pounds of sugar. 

3. Repeat 1, but for each pound of fruit add 2 pounds of sugar. 

4. To 1 pound of berries add 1 pound of sugar. Let stand over night in 
refrigerator. Bring to boil and boil 5 minutes. Add another pound of sugar

2. Repeat 1, but first cook the pears until tender in water. Then add a 
pound of sugar for each pound of fruit and cook to the same concentration 
as under 1.

CHAPTER V 
JELLY 

The earliest work on jelly from a school laboratory is that of Gold- 
thwaite. Since that time many valuable contributions have been made deal- 
ing with jelly making. Probably the most extended recent investigations 
are those of Spencer, of Olsen, and of Tarr and his associates, Baker and 
Myers. They believe that the formation of jelly "depends almost entirely 
upon the application of the laws of chemistry, more especially the laws of 
physical chemistry." 

Jelly formation. Spencer offers a new theory for gelation of pectin 
jells. Stated briefly it is as follows. A pectin sol is stabilized by hj^dration 
and a negative charge of the pectin particles. The greatest stability comes 
in the neutral range as increasing either alkalinity or acidity decreases its 
stability. In jelly the role of the sugar is that of a precipitating agent: the 
more acid the solution, the less sugar required for the precipitation of the 
pectin. Salts may aid in precipitation or tend to prevent it, depending on 
whether they increase or decrease the stability of the pectin. 

For theoretical study of pectin jelly Spencer recommends mixing the 
constituents of the jelly while cold instead of the usual boiling of the 
sugar and juice, which she calls the hot evaporation method. The reasons 
for this are four in number. Decomposition of both sugar and pectin occurs 
during cooking. The proportions of the various constituents change by 
evaporation, hence it is difficult always to obtain the concentration desired. 
The precipitating agent sugar has a limited solubility. There is danger 
of premature precipitation of the pectin if all the cold sugar is added at 
one time to the hot pectin mixture. For this experimental work dried pectin 
or a concentrated pectin solution is necessary. 

Olsen summarizes the theory of jelly formation as follows: Granted that 
pectin is a negatively charged hydrophilic colloid, the following may be 
assumed: (1) sugar is the dehydrating agent; (2) the hydrogen-ion con- 
centration reduces the negative charge on the pectin, thereby permitting the 
pectin to precipitate and coalesce in the form of a network of insoluble 
fibers, provided the concentration of sugar is sufficient; (3) the dehydration 
of the pectin micelles by sugar is not instantaneous but requires time to 
come to an equilibrium; (4) the rate of hydration and precipitation in- 
creases in direct ratio as the hydrogen-ion concentration; (5) the maximum 
jelly strength is reached when the system reaches equilibrium, and depends 
upon the position of that equilibrium; (6) any component added to a pectin 
jelly system, including salts, which causes a change in the ultimate jelly 

152 



SOURCES OF PECTIN IN PLANTS 153 

strength of that system may function either (a) by changing the rate of 
gelation, or (b) by affecting the ultimate jelly structure, or (c) a com- 
bination of these two. 

Fruits Used for Jelly 

For a fruit juice to make a good jelly by boiling with the addition of 
sugar only, the juice must contain a sufficient amount of a substance called 
pectin and also sufficient acid. Some fruit juices will not make acceptable 
jelly by this method because they are deficient in pectin, whereas others 
do not contain enough acid. In the middle states west of the Mississippi 
River the fruits most commonly used to make jelly without addition of 
pectin are apples, crab-apples, blackberries, sour plums, grapes, currants, 
and gooseberries. During the winter months cranberries are used exten- 
sively. 

Cruess and McNair have reported that the following fruit juices con- 
tain sufficient acid and pectin to produce good jelly: blackberries, logan- 
berries, Isabella grapes, Tokay grapes, cranberries, currants, whole lemons, 
and pomelos. They state that oranges have enough pectin but not always 
enough acid. Apricots and cherries sometimes make jelly but are usually 
deficient in pectin. Pomegranates and strawberries have enough acid but 
lack pectin, and pears, peaches, and huckleberries lack both pectin and acid. 
Citron melons and mission figs have enough pectin but lack acid. They state 
that lemon is too high in acid to produce a good jelly, but that two whole 
oranges and one whole lemon make a good combination, the acidity of the 
lemon allowing for the deficiency in the orange. 

By the addition of pectin and sugar, all fruit juices, so far as the author 
knows, can be used for jelly. 

The Pectic Substances 

Nomenclature of the pectic substances. The dififerent names used 
in the literature for pectin and its related compounds have been numerous. 
To avoid confusion, the Committee on the Nomenclature of the Pectic 
Substances (Dore, Chairman) have proposed dividing these into three 
groups: (1) protopectin, (2) pectin, and (3) pectic acid. The chemical 
identity of the various pectic substances is not definitely settled, but a 
great deal of investigational work is being done at the present time. 

Function of pectic substances in plant life. The pectic substances 
play an important role in plant life. Dore states that the primary function 
of the pectic substances is the cementing together of the individual cells 
that compose the plant. 

Sources of pectin in plants. The pectic substances are found in the 
leaves, bark, roots, tubers, stalks, and fruits of plants. The pectic com- 
pounds occur in two places in the plant cell — in the middle lamella, where 



154 JELLY 

they serve as cementing material, and as thickened places on the cell wall. 
These two sources may yield slightly different substances. In fruits the 
pectin is usually found in the pulp and not in the juice, though there are 
some exceptions. For example, currant juice often contains pectin. The 
skins and cores of fruit like apples contain large proportions of pectin. 
Hence, apples and crab-apples are cut into small pieces, but not peeled 
or cored, for making jelly. Some of the root stocks, such as sugar beets, 
carrots, rutabagas, and turnips, contain appreciable amounts of pectin. 

The amount of pectin not only varies in different fruits, but also in the 
same fruit at various stages of ripeness and in the same fruit in different 
years or seasons. 

Protopectin. Protopectin has been called pectose and pectinogen. It 
is the water-insoluble pectic substance in plants. It may be rendered soluble 
by the enzyme protopectinase or by treatment with acid and other reagents. 
The soluble substances thus formed are designated as pectins. 

Sucharipa has presented evidence that the protopectin is combined with 
cellulose. In the plant, the separation of the pectin from the cellulose is 
brought about by hydrolysis by the enzyme protopectinase. 

The protopectin is the precursor of pectin. As the fruit ripens, pectin 
increases while the protopectin decreases. Protopectin is also converted to 
pectin by boiling with dilute acid. Since fruit juices contain acid, some 
protopectin is changed to pectin when the fruit is boiled. This is the reason 
why cooked fruit juices are better for jelly than uncooked ones. 

Conrad', influenced by Ehrlich's work, found that as the pectin of the 
fruit increases, a pentose-bearing polysaccharide is liberated at the same 
time from the protopectin, its proportions paralleling that of the pectin 
to a great extent. This furfural-yielding polysaccharide is separated from 
the pectic substances by its solubility in 70 per cent alcohol. 

Pectin. Among the various names that have been applied to pectin are 
parapectin, pectinogen, and protopectin. The term is applied to the meth- 
ylated pectic substances that form a colloidal solution in water. It is the 
jelly-forming substances of the pectic compounds, although the pectins with 
fewer methyl groups have less jellying power than those with a greater 
number. 

According to Sucharipa the pectins may be classified into ( 1 ) free pectins, 
which are removable from the plant by water solution, and (2) hydrol- 
ysis pectins, which result from treating protopectin with hydrolyzing 
agents. 

Pectic acid. In fruit, protopectin is changed to pectin by enzymes of 
the fruit. With still further ripening, pectic acid is formed from pectin 
by the enzyme pectase. These changes are gradual, but the larger portion 
of the pectic acid is formed when the fruit is ripe and when decay begins. 
In the presence of pectase and calcium, barium, or strontium salts, pectic 
acid may form a gel. 

Dore states that, when the protopectin is in combination with cellulose. 



THE PECTIC SUBSTANCES 155 

the under-ripe fruit is firm. As the fruit ripens it becomes softer as the 
protopectin is changed to the pectin. Rotten fruit is entirely disintegrated 
because the pectin has been changed to pectic acid. 

In fruits the rate at which softening takes place depends largely upon 
the temperature. Haller has shown this for a number of varieties of apples 
in storage. The rate "at 40°F. was found to be slightly more than double 
that at 32°, whereas that at 50° was slightly less than double that at 
40°, and that at 60° nearly double the rate at 50°." 

Pectinase is a term applied to the enzyme which hydrolyzes pectin and 
pectic acid into their simplest cleavage products. 

Constitution of the pectic substances. The constitution of the 
pectic substances is not definitely known. The purest pectins, when treated 
with a dilute alkali, yield 10 to 12 per cent of methyl alcohol, showing 
that methoxy groups (CH3O) are found in the molecule. As the methoxy 
groups are split off, different series of pectin compounds are formed, these 
compounds having different jellying powers. The greater the number of 
methoxy groups split off, the less the jellying power and the more sirupy 
the jelly. Pectic acid is the demethoxylated pectin. Since pectic acid is the 
simplest and the most easily purified of the pectic compounds, it has been 
prepared in the purest state. Schryver and Haynes have suggested that 
pectic acid is composed of one molecule of galactose, one of arabinose, and 
four of galacturonic acid arranged in a ring, the last having the four car- 
boxyls of the acid groups free for methyl ester formation. 

Sucharipa states that the chemical difference between free pectins and 
hydrolysis pectins is that arabinose is in the former, whereas it is split off 
from the latter by hydrolysis. 

Other investigators question the presence of arabinose as a constituent 
of pectic acid, since it is impossible for it to be formed from galacturonic 
acid. Acetic acid has been reported among the decomposition products of 
pectic acid obtained from pectin of flax and sugar beets. 

Olsen states that most of the recent work on the chemistry of the pectin 
molecule fails to consider that pectins may vary depending upon their source. 
He adds that it has long been known commercially that citrus and apple 
pectins, irrespective of grade, form jellies of definitely different types, 
though this has not been recognized in the scientific literature. 

Protopectin and pectic acid do not form jellies. Protopectin and 
pectic acid do not form jelly when cooked with sugar and a fruit juice 
containing acid, although pectin forms a jelly under these conditions. Since 
over-ripe fruit contains a larger proportion of pectic acid and a smaller 
percentage of pectin, this furnishes the explanation for the fact that many 
jelly makers have long known, that juice from partially ripe fruit makes 
a better jelly than juice from over-ripe fruit. 

Cooked extracted fruit juice is better for jelly. Fruit juice ex- 
tracted raw or without cooking will seldom make jelly, or it yields a jelly of 
poor quality. Since the protopectin is not soluble in the juice of the fruit, if 



156 JELLY 

the juice is extracted raw it remains with the pulp of the fruit. If cooked, 
some of the protopectin is changed to pectin. Goldthwaite has reported 
experiments with apple and some other fruit juices extracted raw. Either 
no jelly was obtained or it had a poor texture. 

Extraction o£ and preparation o£ juice for jelly. Hard fruits like 
apples and crab-apples are cut into small pieces or ground with a food chop- 
per, barel}^ covered with water, and cooked. Soft berries need little water 
added, ^4 cup to a pound of fruit often being used. Currants that are not 
too ripe should have a larger proportion of w^ater. Gooseberries, if green, 
because of their very high acid and pectin content and the character of the 
pectin, can be completely covered w^ith water, and sometimes will need 
additional w^ater. Ripe gooseberries require the same proportion of water 
used for other berries. After cooking, the juice is drained without squeezing 
from the pulp by placing the cooked material in a cloth bag. Fruits that 
are very rich in pectin may have two or three extractions made. These 
second and third extractions need to be boiled down more than the first 
extraction to concentrate the pectin. Second and third extractions also do 
not have as much of the fruit flavor as the first one. 

Apple juice sometimes contains starch, particularly that from under-ripe 
fruit, which renders the juice cloudy. Askew states that starch formation 
begins near the periphery and progresses toward the core ; but as the fruit 
matures the core area is cleared of starch first, the area near the skin last. 
Commercially, diastase can be added to convert the starch to sugar and thus 
clear the juice. 

Grape juice contains tartaric acid, which often crystallizes in long needle- 
like cr3^stals in the jelly. It can be removed partially from the juice by put- 
ting the juice in a refrigerator (the colder the better, but it is less soluble 
at lower temperatures), over night, or for a few days, and then straining 
the crystals from the juice. 

The Role of Pectin in Jelly Formation 

According to Spencer's theory, the precipitation of pectin forms the jelly. 
Sugar, glycerin, or alcohol may be used as precipitating agents. Spencer 
states "The successful making of alcohol jellies requires rapidity of motion 
and practice, otherwise one obtains a precipitate and not a homogeneous 
jelly." The qualitative aspects of the boundary line between fields of the 
jelly and the sol shown in Fig. 14 are by Spencer. She states that the 
quantitative aspects of these boundary lines are meaningless, because the 
pectin used contained some ash. From this figure it is deduced that jellies 
with sugar as the precipitating agent are not possible in the neutral region 
owing to the solubility limit of sugar. Although alkaline jellies are in- 
teresting theoretically, practically they are of less importance, since they 
cannot be used as food on account of their flavor. 

Concentration of pectin required for jelly. The strength of the 



PECTIN TEST BY ALCOHOL 



157 



jelly is in proportion to the concentration of the pectin, if other factors re- 
main the same. Too small a proportion of pectin yields a jelly that is too soft 
and sirupy ; too great a concentration gives a product that is too firm and hard. 
However, after a certain amount of pectin has been added any excess re- 
mains inactive. The concentration of pectin required for a jelly of good con- 
sistency varies with the proportion of sugar used, the acidity of the juice or 
solution, the salt content of the particular juice being used, the time, and 
temperature factors. Good home-made jelly may contain 0.75 to 1.0 per 
cent of pectin. Commercial jelly, on account of shipping, is somewhat stiffer, 
averaging about 1.25 per cent of pectin. 

Pectins from different sources yield characteristic jellies. Olsen 
states that jellies made from citrus pectins are comparatively friable and

have little elasticity; whereas jellies made from apple pectins are highly 
elastic, but require and tolerate less acid than citrus pectin jellies similarly 
prepared. Cranberry pectin tends to yield firm jellies which will not spread 
readily. Cox states that a better-textured cranberry jelly for spreading pur- 
poses is obtained if the pectin occurring in the juice is hydrolyzed by adding 
the enzyme pectinase, available in commercial form under the name Pec- 
tinol. A slower-setting pectin is then added to the juice. With a rapid- 
setting pectin gelation may start before the sirup is poured, and the pouring 
breaks the structure so that a mass of small lumps is formed. 

Three fairly easy methods of determining the amount of pectin present 
in fruit juice are available for the housekeeper. One is to cook a small 
portion of the juice with sugar to see if it will form jelly. Another is to 
test the juice with alcohol. The third is to test the viscosity of the juice 
with a jelmeter. 

Pectin test by alcohol. Alcohol precipitates pectin in a jelly-like mass. 
By the character of the precipitated pectin an approximate estimate can be 
made of the amount of pectin in the juice. For the test, 1 tablespoon oi 



158 JELLY 

juice is poured into 3 to 5 tablespoons of alcohol. Sometimes equal quantities 
of juice and alcohol are used, but the larger amount of alcohol gives a 
better test. Turn the container gently from side to side. If a test tube or 
graduated cylinder is used it can be turned slowly upside down and back 
to bring all the juice in contact with the alcohol. If the pectin comes down 
in a solid mass there is a sufficient quantity to make jelly. If the pectin is 
flocculent or in small flakes the juice needs boiling down to concentrate the 
pectin. 

Johnston and Denton have reported that the amount of alcohol precipi- 
tate in citrus pectin extracts does not indicate the jellying power. It may 
also be possible that the amount precipitated in different juices will show 
different jellying strengths. Of course, alcohol precipitates such substances 
as gums and starch in addition to the pectin. The precipitated mass becomes 
firmer after standing in the alcohol a few minutes, so the estimate should 
be made just after mixing. 

For the pectin test, straight ethyl alcohol, denatured, or wood alcohol 
can be used. The denatured alcohol is better to use than the wood alcohol 
and usually gives a satisfactory test. When wood alcohol is used, the 
precipitated pectin may be redissolved after standing a few minutes. This 
may also be true of some denatured alcohol. 

Pectin test by viscosity. Based on the observed correlation of the 
viscosity of pectin solutions with the jellying power of the pectin, Baker 
has developed a jelmeter. The viscosity of the fruit juice is determined 
by the rate of flow of the juice through a given orifice compared with the 
time of flow of an equal quantity of water at the same temperature. The 
viscosity or thickness of the fruit juice is dependent principally upon its 
pectin concentration, although sugars, starches, and proteins influence it 
slightly. If the approximate viscosity is known, then the amount of sugar 
to use and the weight to which the jelly should be cooked can be determined. 
Baker has prepared such tables. 

The jelmeter is similar to a graduated pipette. The test is easy to make 
and practical. It works satisfactorily with the fruit juices that have been 
tested. 

Effect o£ high temperatures and a long period of heating upon 
pectin. Numerous investigators, among them Johnston and Denton, 
Sucharipa, and Tarr, have found that high temperatures decrease the jelly- 
ing power of pectin. Myers and Baker state that "Prolonged heating of 
pectin solution has a deleterious effect on the jellying power of the solution. 
The higher the temperature the greater the decrease in jellying power 
of the pectin." They find that heat has the same effect on the powdered 
pectin as upon the pectin in solution. 

The boiling of a pectin solution with acid decreases the amount of pectin 
in the solution because of the formation of pectic acid by hydrolysis. Some 
of Tarr's data seem to indicate that, if the sugar is in the juice during 



COMMERCIAL PECTIN 



159 



the boiling period, hydrolysis Is delayed. The following table is from 
Tarr's results and shows that the decrease In jelly strength was con- 
siderable when the pectin and acid were boiled before the sugar was added. 
Commercial pectin. Commercial pectin is on the market in two 
forms : ( 1 ) the liquid form and (2) the powdered dry pectin. The first type 
of commercial pectin is a concentrated liquid pectin. It usually contains 4 
to 4.5 per cent of pectin. The second form is a mixture of dry powdered 
pectin and sugar. It is similar to dry gelatin and sugar mixtures on the 
market In that It contains the sugar, and only the juice needs to be added 
for making jelly. Wilson states that there is no uniformity In jelly strength

of these pectin preparations but that a dry pectin that will jell about 40 
times Its weight of sugar is a practical one. The dry powdered pectin is 
sold in large quantities to commercial jelly and jam makers. The dry pectin 
without the added sugar is now available for the housekeeper. 

Rooker states that the powdered pectins will eventually replace the 
liquid pectins. This Is because the "powder is cheaper. Is easier to handle, 
haul, cart, and store. It does not spoil and deteriorate. Powdered apple 
pectin retains its jellying strength indefinitely while sirup pectins deteriorate 
if kept any material length of time. A container of powdered pectin may 
be opened and used as needed, while a container of pectin sirup must be 
used almost at once or the balance of the opened can will spoil." 

Rooker gives many uses of pectin in addition to making jelly and jam. 
Among these are use in emulsions for pharmaceutical purposes, In emul- 



160 JELLY 

sions for tree spraying, in crushed fruits for soda fountains, as "candy 
doctors," in confections, etc. 

Myers and Baker after extensive experiments with the jellying proper- 
ties of pectic substances, recommend that pectin should be bought and sold 
on a basis of jellying strength. 

Olsen states that, commercially, pectins are graded on the basis of the 
amount of sugar they will carry. Thus a 160-grade pectin, as supplied by 
a definite source, is one which, when used in a jelly containing 65 per cent 
of sugar by weight with a proper amount of acid in the proportion of one 
part of pectin to 160 parts of sugar, yields a satisfactory jelly. Olsen has 
also shown that the strength of a jelly will vary with the temperature to 
which the pectin is heated. Hence a standardized procedure for testing 
pectin strength is essential. 

With the aid of commercial pectin, which the housekeeper can add to 
fruit juices that are deficient in pectin, jelly and jam can be made from 
many varieties of fruit. 

The Role of Acid in Jelly Formation 

Although acid is not essential for jelly formation its presence in fruit 
jellies is very important. Singh has reported that "between certain limits 
the greater the acidity of the juice the lower the amount of sugar re- 
quired." He adds that it has long been known that juices of high acidity 
yield firmer jellies than juices deficient in acid but with as high a pectin 
content. 

Spencer has published data showing the increase of rigidity of jellies 
with increase of acid when the pectin and sugar concentrations are con- 
stant. Spencer explains the action of acid in this way. The strength of a 
jell netw^ork depends upon the continuity and the rigidity of the structure. 
"Continuity of structure, by hypothesis, depends upon the number and 
proximity of pectin particles at the time of precipitation," which in turn 
is determined by the degree of dispersion and concentration of the pectin. 
"DifFerepces in rigidity are due to the amount of water retained by the 
pectin at the equilibrium established during precipitation." Hydrogen (or 
hydroxyl) ions lessen the stability of the pectin sol by decreasing the hydra- 
tion capacity of the pectin. Hence in an acid medium less sugar is required 
to bring about precipitation. Nearly neutral fruit juices will not form 
jelly with sugar because the sugar is not soluble enough to allow precipita- 
tion of the more stabile pectin. Hence with a definite concentration of 
pectin the rigidity of the jelly is determined by the sugar and acid con- 
centrations. 

Hydrogen-ion concentration and jelly. Tarr has determined the 
minimum amounts of several acids required to produce a jelly and also 
the amount of the acids to produce an optimum jelly by the hot evaporation 
method with pectin, sugar, acid, and water. Optimum jelly is defined as 



ACIDS IN FRUITS 161 

the jelly which in his judgment has the best texture. For jelly formation, 
when other conditions were standardized, the minimum amounts of the 
acids were as follows: 8.5 cc. of 0.1 A^ sulfuric acid; 27.5 cc. of 0.1 A^ 
phosphoric acid; 22.7 cc. of 0.1 N tartaric acid; 52.9 cc. of 0.1 N citric 
acid; and 583.3 cc. of 0.1 A^ acetic acid. The total acidity of the minimum 
amounts required for forming a jelly varied, but the acids were all at the 
same pH, 3.40. For optimum jelly the acids were all at pH 3.1. 

But although hydrogen-ion concentration controls the formation and 
character of the jelly to a certain extent, the salt content of pectin or of 
fruit juices, the temperature to which the pectin is heated, and the rate of 
pouring may extend this pH range, as will be seen later. In Tarr's jelly a 
pH of 3.46 gave a very tender jelly, but increasing the hydrogen-ion con- 
centration below />H 3.1 gave syneresis or weeping. The best jellies were 
obtained with pH 3.3 to 3.1. Olsen and others have suggested that with pH 
lower than 3.1, jelly failure and increased syneresis may result because of 
the increased rate of setting. Olsen has shown that an increase of hydrogen- 
ion concentration increases the rate at which the jelly sets. 

The hydrogen-ion concentration of ordinary fruit juices depends upon 
the particular acid present, upon the quantity of acid present, and upon 
the "buffer" action exerted by the particular juice. 

Relation of the time factor to optimum acidity. Olsen assumed 
that the lowering of jelly strength might be caused by incomplete dehydra- 
tion of the pectin and lessened precipitation or by a more flexible network 
of pectin. To test the second postulate he prepared jellies by heating the 
pectin to 55°C. and to boiling. The jelly at 55° was made as follows: The 
pectin, 30 grams of sugar, and water to make a total weight of 140 grams 
were brought to 36°C. The minimum amount of acid, the remaining sugar, 
and water were boiled together, cooled to 65°C., and adjusted to correct 
weight with distilled water. The additional acid and the pectin solution 
were added and stirred, the time was varied from the moment the pectin 
solution was poured into the warm sirup until the mixture was poured in 
jelly glasses, as shown in Table 22. The strength was tested with a Tarr 
and Baker jelly strength tester. Olsen states that a high-grade pectin made 
by the standardized hot method gives a reading close to 45. 

The optimum pH varies with the time factor. The principal variation is 
the rate of gelation of the pectin as influenced by the acid concentration. 
Olsen explains this as follows: "The largest or 'optimum' amount of the 
acid to be used will be that point at which an additional increase in acid 
will increase the rate of setting to a point where loss in jelly strength due to 
a disturbance of the jelly in the stirring or pouring exactly balances the 
strengthening effect of that same increment of acid." Or in other words, 
stirring or pouring hinders jelly formation, which is offset by increasing 
the hydrogen-ion concentration. 

Acids in fruits. The acids occurring naturally in fruit juices that 
are used for jelly are tartaric, malic, and citric. Sometimes acetic acid is

added to apple juice to make spiced apple jelly. Tarr's results show that 
acetic acid is of little value to add to a juice to increase its jellying power, 
because it volatilizes during boiling and is only slightly ionized in solution. 

Goldthwaite has reported that, when tartaric and citric acids w^ere used to 
acidify fruit juices deficient in acid, tartaric acid gave better results, the 
texture and flavor being better than when citric acid was used. Tarr's 
results confirm Goldthwaite's observations. Spencer explains this difference 
in the following manner. Since pectin sols are partially stabilized by a 
negative charge, the preferential absorption of one anion above that of 
another would increase the stability of the pectin sol. In other words, the 
citrate ion is more strongly absorbed than the tartrate ion, hence increases 
the negative charge on the pectin to a greater extent, making it more stable, 
less easily precipitated, so that a weaker jelly is obtained with citric acid 
than tartaric, if the same concentrations of pectin and sugar are used. 

Methods of reporting acidity of fruit juices. Investigators have 
reported concentration of acids required for jelly in different ways. The 
/»H gives the concentration of hydrogen ion or ionized part of the acid. 
Some report acid as number of cubic centimeters per 100 grams of jelly. 
However, work done some time ago was usually reported in percentage of 



ROLE OF SALTS IN JELLY FORMATION 163 

some acid, not necessarily the one found in the fruit. It has often been 
reported as sulfuric acid. The concentration of the acid is determined by 
titration with an alkali ; from the quantity of alkali required the percentage 
of acid is calculated. Campbell states that 0.3 per cent as sulfuric acid 
is required to produce a jelly of good quality, the minimum being 0.27 
and the maximum 0.5 per cent. Goldthwaite has reported from 0.154 to 
1.892 per cent as sulfuric acid. Singh has reported still lower percentages 
of acids than these, but his jellies with a very low percentage of acid 
contain an unusually high percentage of pectin. 

The Effect of Temperature to Which Pectin Is Heated 
on Jelly Strength 

Olsen states that the abnormally high jelly strength with pectin heated 
to only 55°, shown in Table 22, is not the result of the time factor alone. 
To prove this he recovered the pectin from duplicate batches of jelly, one 
of which had been heated to 100° and poured; the other poured at 50°C. 
The recovered pectins were remade into jelly at 50°. Both gave jellies test- 
ing as high in strength as the original jelly poured at 50 °C. This proved 
that the lesser strength of the pectin heated to 100° was not due to hydrol- 
ysis of the pectin but the effect of temperature upon the gel structure. From 
these results Olsen concludes that "the structure of jelly is fundamentally 
different when slowly set from the hot solution than when rapidly set from 
the cool sirup. If we assume that pectin exists in two states of hydration; 
that is, if the amount of water bound by the pectin fibrils differs depending 
upon the temperature at which the pectin is precipitated, then a ready ex- 
planation is at hand." 

These results are not to be interpreted as showing that hydrolysis of the 
pectin does not occur with long boiling but that none takes place with a 
short-boil process. 

The Role of Salts in Jelly Formation 

The role salts play in jelly formation is not emphasized as much as 
that of pectin, acid, and sugar, but it is an important one. All fruit juices 
contain salts of the acids found in the fruit. In addition to these, other 
salts may be found. 

Halliday and Bailey have reported that the addition of calcium chloride 
favors jelly formation, as somewhat lower concentrations of pectin, acid, 
and sugar are required when it is added. On the acid side, sodium chloride 
tends to prevent jelly formation, i.e., larger quantities of acid and sugar 
are required when sodium chloride is added. Spencer has reported that on 
the alkaline side sodium chloride tends to precipitate the pectin. Spencer 
has also reported that, with the same anion, chlorine, the precipitating effect 
of the cation increased with increasing valence, or Al > Ca > Na. With 



164 JELLY 

the same cation but different anions Spencer gives the order of absorption 
of the negative ion by pectin as acetate > citrate > tartrate. This means 
that the tartrate is not so strongly adsorbed as the citrate or acetate ions, 
hence has less stabilizing effect and is more easily precipitated by sugar. 
The chloride anion is more strongly absorbed than the nitrate or sulfate 
ions. 

Salts buffer a fruit juice so that more acid is required to give a definite 
pH when salts are present. But the hydrogen ion is not the only positive 
ion in the fruit juice. Myers and Baker have found that the cation of the 
salt may supplement the hydrogen ion, but only at definite hydrogen-ion 
concentrations. No jelly was formed with added salts above pK 3.6. Thus 
jellies from fruit juices may have a slightly wider range of hydrogen-ion 
concentration for jelly formation than those from pure water, acid, pectin, 
and sugar. Myers and Baker used sulfuric, tartaric, and citric acids and 
the sodium salts of these acids in their investigations. 

The negatively charged ion of a salt tends to stabilize pectin sols, but 
those anions absorbed most strongly exert the most stabilizing effect. These 
negatively charged anions may be neutralized by the positively charged ion 
of a salt, but the adsorption of cations also varies, so that some have a 
greater destabilizing effect than others. Since all pectins contain salts, the 
quantitative recipes worked out for one pectin may not give exactly the 
same results with other pectins because of a different salt content. 

The Role of Sugar in Jelly Formation 

Sugar, if its concentration and that of acid and pectin is sufficient, pre- 
cipitates the pectin. Spencer explains this precipitation as follows. When a 
pectin sol is formed, *'an equilibrium is reached between the partial pressure 
of the adsorbed water" of the pectin *'and that in the dispersing medium." 
When sugar is added to the pectin sol, this equilibrium is disturbed, for 
when the sugar dissolves in the dispersion medium it lowers the vapor 
pressure of the dispersing medium. As a result the pectin particles lose 
water and are less stable. Increases in sugar accelerate the setting of the 
jelly, probably because of increased dehydration, although rate of setting 
is also modified by other factors. 

Jelly without added sugar. Jelly can be made by boiling down some 
fruit juices until they yield a ''jelly test." The concentration of 2 cups of 
gooseberry juice yields less than ^ cup of gummy, tough, sticky jelly. If 
left with the lid off for a few days it becomes dry enough to handle. It 
is very dark in color, looking and feeling very much like licorice candy. 
The fruit flavor is present, although scarcely noticeable at first, because of 
the extremely acid taste. 

When to add sugar in jelly making. As previously stated, Tarr 
has found that the jellying strength of the pectin is lessened if boiled 
before the addition of sugar. Yet, if the sugar is added to the pectin and 



PROPORTION OF SUGAR AND JELLY YIELD 165 

acid prior to boiling, the jelly strength is not decreased even when boiled 
as long as 42.8 minutes. Directions for making jelly often state to boil 
the juice for a certain number of minutes before the sugar is added. From 
Tarr's results it would seem a much better practise to add the sugar to 
the juice and concentrate it after the sugar is added. Long boiling of the 
sugar and fruit juice produces a darker-colored jelly, the extent of the 
darkening depending upon the juice and the length of time of boiling. With 
dark fruit juices this is not desirable, but it may improve the appearance 
of light-colored ones. To prevent darkening after the sugar is added, the 
jelly can be made in small lots so that boiling to the desired concentration 
can be accomplished quickly. In extracting the fruit juice too much water 
should not be added, as a large quantity of water only dilutes the pectin, 
and then boiling is required to concentrate it. 

Concentration o£ sugar in finished jell. Jelly can be made with a 
wide range or proportion of sugar to juice, from about 40 to 70 per cent 
in the finished jell. From the reports in the literature, the average per- 
centage of sugar in commercial jelly, unless acidity or pectin is abnormally 
high, varies from 60 to 65 per cent. The concentration of sugar desirable 
in the finished jelly varies somewhat with the juice from which the jelly 
is made. Thus gooseberry juice, which usually has a pH 2.6 to 2.8 and also 
has a high pectin content, is usually of better texture if the final concen- 
tration of sugar is short of or about 60 per cent. Cox states that for cran- 
berry sauce too stiff a jelly can be prevented by stopping the boiling process 
when the sugar concentration is somewhat below 60 per cent. Cox states 
that premature gelation can be brought about by too much pectin, acid, or 
sugar, or all three. For some fruit juices Tarr and Baker have found 
that 70 per cent of sugar in the finished product gives a jelly of good tex- 
ture. With higher concentrations than 75 per cent the sugar may crystallize 
from the jelly. 

Proportion of sugar and jelly yield in illustrations. In general, 
other factors remaining constant, the yield of jelly parallels the amount of 
sugar added. The gooseberry juice for the jellies in the illustrations is from 
the same source, so that the pectin content and viscosity of the juice were 
the same. The percentage of sugar in the finished jell is about 60, since all 
were boiled to 103°C. In Experiment 24 the yield of" jelly parallels the 
sugar added. See Figs. 15 and 16. The firmness of the different jellies 
varies. The 2 cups of juice boiled down yield less than ^ cup of jelly. It 
is very firm, hard, and difficult to pull apart. The percentage of sugar in 
it is not known, but both the pectin and acid have been enormously concen- 
trated. With }i cup of sugar to a cup of juice the yield is a little more 
than 34 cup of jelly. This jelly is very firm, solid, and hard. With ^ cup 
of sugar to a cup of juice the yield is a little more than ^ cup of jelly. 
This jelly is a little more tender than the one with % cup of sugar but 
produces a jelly that is still too firm. It should be remembered that whereas 
each cup of juice had the same concentration of acid and pectin before the 



166 



JELLY 



sugar was added, the addition of varying amounts of sugar and boiling to 
103°C. gives a concentration of practically 60 per cent of sugar in all the 
jellies. But the boiling to produce a concentration of 60 per cent of sugar 
thereby concentrates the pectin and acid, the concentration being greater 
per unit of w^eight in the jelly to which the smallest proportion of sugar 
was added. That the acid is concentrated is shown bv the flavor, for the

jelly from ^ cup of sugar and 1 cup of juice is very tart, the tartness 
progressively decreasing as larger proportions of sugar are added. This is 
true of the first extraction of most fruit juices. As the proportion of sugar 
is increased, the yield of jelly is increased. There is a proportion of sugar 
that produces the best jelly for the particular juice used. With increasing 
amounts of sugar beyond the proportion that yields an optimum jelly, the

jelly becomes softer until a proportion of sugar is finally reached that 
results in a fluid sirup instead of a jell. 

Proportion of sugar for home-made jell. The proportion of sugar 
to add to the juice cannot be given definitely for the best texture of 
jelly, since it varies with the pectin, acid, and salt content of the juice. The 
amount of pectin varies with the ripeness of the fruit, the quantity of 



SUGAR, PECTIN, ACID, AND SALT 167 

water added for extracting the juice, and with the kind of fruit. Gold- 
thwaite states that it is better to use too little sugar than too much with 
fruit juices. She has found with all kinds of fruit juices and average 
methods of extraction that ^ cup of sugar to a cup of fruit juice usually 
gives better results than a cup of sugar to a cup of juice. The author's 
laboratory and home results agree with those of Goldthwaite that ^ 
cup of sugar to a cup of juice gives a better jelly for most fruit juices. 
Currants if not very ripe need a cup of sugar to a cup of juice, but if a 
larger quantity of water is added for extraction a smaller proportion of 
sugar is needed. The pectin content of gooseberry juice is usually quite 
high, one reason being that they are nearly always picked while green. If 
the rule of adding water to barely cover is used, the gooseberry juice will 
often require 1^ cups of sugar to a cup of juice to give jelly of the best 
texture. 



Fig. 17. — The jelly from the second extraction of gooseberry juice is softer than 
the jelly from the first extraction with corresponding amounts of sugar.

Some idea of the amount of sugar to use can be obtained from the 
alcohol test. With gooseberry juice and using the larger quantity of 
alcohol for the test, the approximate proportion of sugar required for a 
cup of juice can be estimated from the character of the precipitated pectin. 
After mixing, turn the pectin and alcohol out in a dish. If the pectin 
precipitate can be picked up in one piece without breaking and feels firm, 
about \%. to 1 1/3 cups of sugar will be required; if the pectin precipitate 
can be picked up in one piece without breaking but does not feel firm, 
about 1 to 1^ cups of sugar will be necessary; but if the precipitate breaks 
into two pieces when picked up, about ^ to J^ cup of sugar is required. 
If the precipitate is flocculent the juice needs concentrating or only ^2 cup 
or less of sugar can be used. A still easier way to determine the best pro- 
portion of sugar to add is to determine the viscosity with a jellmeter. 

Sugar, pectin, acid, and salt. As can be ascertained from the previous 
discussion there is a relation between proportion of pectin, sugar, acid, 
and salts, temperature to which the pectin is heated, and time of pouring. 
Increases and decreases of constituents may be made within certain limits. 
Salts in the fruit juice or added to it may aid jelly formation or hinder 



168

and delay it, according to whether they tend to precipitate or stabilize the 
pectin. 

Inversion of sugar in jelly making. The saturation point of a 
sucrose solution at room temperature or 20°C. is 67 per cent. Thus 
jellies containing more than 67 per cent of sucrose at 20°C. are super- 
saturated, unless something has occurred to the sugar. The pectin tends to 
keep the sugar from crystallizing from solution, acting as a protective 
colloid. But even this protective action would not always be great enough 
to keep the sugar from crystallizing wdth a concentration of sugar that 
is increased to 70 per cent or over. When sucrose is heated with acid, some 
of the sucrose is inverted to dextrose and levulose. The amount of inverted 
sugar formed during jelly making depends upon the acidity of the fruit 
juice and the length of time of boiling with the sugar. Since there are 
three sugars in the finished jelly the percentage or total sugar that can be 
held in the finished jelly without crystallization occurring is increased. 
Tarr and Baker report that in a solution containing a mixture of sucrose, 
dextrose, and levulose, the total maximum solubility is obtained with the 
proportions of each sugar show^n in Table 23 (obtained from Bureau of 
Standards). 

At 20°C. if inversion has occurred to obtain maximum solubility, about 
75.7 per cent of sugar is soluble. Thus jelly containing about 70 per cent 
of sugar is not necessarily supersaturated. The salts and organic con- 
stituents of the fruit juice may also increase the solubility of the sugar 
in a given solution. 

Rate of inversion in different fruit juices. Tarr and Baker have 
determined the rate of inversion of sucrose during jelly making with 
equivalent solutions of sulfuric, tartaric, and citric acids. As would be

expected, they found the inversion was greater with the stronger or more 
highly ionized acid. Longer heating with a given hydrogen-ion concen- 
tration also increased the amount of inversion. 

Tolman, Munson, and Bisrelow in 1901 obtained results, which we are 



DEXTROSE 169 

now able to interpret on the basis of our present knowledge, on the inver- 
sion of sucrose by juices of different fruits. Their work was published 
before hydrogen-ion concentration was thought of in connection with jelly 
making. After determining the amount of invert sugar in a series of jellies 
and jams that they had made, they concluded that the inversion of the 
sucrose varies with the total amount of free organic acid present and the 
length of time the product is heated. But they found some exceptions to 
their conclusions. Crab-apple jelly with 0.17 per cent acid (as sulfuric) 
gave an inversion of 58.8 per cent of the sucrose, whereas orange jelly of 
the same acidity gave only 4.9 per cent of sucrose inverted. Since the 
inversion is in proportion to the hydrogen-ion concentration if time of 
heating is constant, the greatest inversion occurred with the acid giving 
the highest hydrogen-ion concentration, the tartaric acid of the grape. 
In this instance the total acidity was higher too. Plum with a high total 
acidity of 1.35 per cent yielded a lower percentage inverted than the grape 
with a total acidity of 0.69 per cent. The plum contains malic acid, which 
would result in a lower hydrogen-ion concentration than the tartaric. 

Kinds of Sugar Used in Jelly 

Most jelly is made with sucrose. There are two sources of sucrose : one, 
the sugar beet ; the other, sugar cane. 

Cane or beet sugar. For some unexplained reason many persons believe 
that jelly cannot be made from beet sugar. Shaw in a series of over 2000 
tests found no difference in the two sugars. Lowe and Redfield, working 
in a section of the country where many persons believe that beet sugar 
will not make jelly, could detect no differences in jellies made from beet 
and cane sugar. The sugar was sent from different sections of the state. 
In these experiments the source and kind of sugar were not known until 
the experiments were finished. 

Dextrose. Crystalline dextrose when substituted by weight for sucrose 
in a fruit juice yields a jelly similar in texture to that obtained with 
sucrose. It is not so sweet as the jelly made with sucrose. In the jelly 
made with dextrose, crystallization of the sugar occurs. Crystals usually 
begin to form at the top of the surface of the jelly in 24 hours. They 
increase until the whole mass is crystallized. The shape of the masses of 
cr5^stals resembles coral formation or reminds one of the flowerets of 
cauliflower except that they are colored. See Fig. 18. If the glass is full of 
jelly the crystals push up the top of the lid and bulge out over the side. 
Sometimes the first crystals appear in spots throughout the jelly instead of 
on the surface. Sometimes the first crystals are longer than 24 hours in 
appearing. If the jelly is turned out of the glass, crystallization occurs 
rapidly and the whole mass is usually crystallized in 48 hours or less. If 
dextrose is substituted for 50 per cent of sucrose, crystallization may not 
occur, and if crystals do appear they are slower in forming. About 50 per 



170 JELLY 

cent of the jellies made in the author's laboratory with one-half sucrose 
and one-half dextrose crystallized. 

Levulose. Levulose also forms jelly, but it is more likely to be sirupy, 
and if a jelly is formed the sirup must be boiled to 107°C., which brings 
the levulose nearer to its saturation point. 

Maltose. Maltose has been used by the author for gooseberry and cur- 
rant jelly. Maltose is considerably less soluble than sucrose and a little 




Fig. 18. — Jelly made from crystalline dextrose. Showing crystal formation 48 
hours after the jelly had been turned out of the glass and 72 hours after the jelly 
was made. 

less soluble than dextrose at room temperatures. The jelly made with 
maltose is very tart and crystallizes as readily, or more so, as jelly made 
with dextrose. 

Syneresis 

Syneresis occurs in some fruit jellies. It is probably more common in 
cranberry jelly than in other fruit jellies. Tarr found that, with a hydro- 
gen-ion concentration greater than pH 3.1, fluid exuded from the jelly. 
Myers and Baker have reported that syneresis in jellies may be brought 
about by the hydrogen ion alone, or by the hydrogen ion and cation of 
an added salt together, but not by the cation of the salt alone. They 
have also reported that the anion of a salt by acting as a buffering agent 
may prevent syneresis. 

Whether syneresis occurs in a jelly also depends on the source of the 
pectin. The writer has never seen syneresis occur with gooseberry jelly, 
even when the />H of the jelly is 2.6 or lower. Some citrus pectins made 
into jelly show no syneresis at />H 2.0 or lower. 



STORAGE OF JELLY 171 

The rate of dehydration or setting and mechanical disturbance alter the 
jelly starts to set may also influence syneresis. 

Temperature for Boiling Sirup for Jelly 

If the boiling point of sugar solutions is referred to, p. 49, it is found 
that a sugar solution containing 60 per cent of sugar boils at 103.0°C., 
and a 70 per cent solution boils at 106.5°C. A jelly boiled to 103°C. 
would contain approximately 60 per cent of sugar, and one boiled to 
106.5°C. would contain approximately 70 per cent of sugar. Evidently, a 
jelly cooked to a temperature between these two temperatures would con- 
tain between 60 and 70 per cent of sugar. 

Cruess and McNair have reported that jellies containing amounts of 
sugar indicated by boiling to 65° Brix give a good concentration for jelly. 
A solution of sugar of 65° Brix boils at sea level at 103.9°C. Cruess and 
McNair state that if, to the boiling point of water of any locality, 3.9°C. 
or 7.02°F. is added, a suitable boiling point for jelly will be obtained 
for that locality. 

The directions in the laboratory outline state to boil the sirup to a 
temperature of 103°C. for jelly. This is for a location where the water 
boils at 99°C. This is sufficient for fruit juices that contain a high per- 
centage of pectin and have a high acidity. This would give approximately 
60 per cent of sugar in the finished jelly. Some juices with a low acidity 
and pectin content will yield better jelly if boiled to a higher temperature 
than 103°C. A temperature between 104° and 105°C. yields a jelly with 
a sugar content of about 65 per cent. If they do not jell with a tempera- 
ture of 105° to 106°C. the juice does not contain sufficient pectin or acid. 

Jelly test. The method of housekeepers of determining when jelly is 
boiled sufficiently is to let a portion of the sirup drop from a spoon. 
When the sirup "sheets" o£E the spoon the jellying temperature has been 
reached. 

Storage of Jelly 

Jelly deteriorates in flavor on standing. Freshly made jelly has a better 
flavor and aroma than jelly that has been made and stored for some time. 
The cooking causes some decomposition of flavoring products. In stand- 
ing, some of the aromatic substances and flavoring substances are volatil- 
ized and some are probably lost by decomposition. 

Storage, mold, and sugar concentration. With too high a percent- 
age of sugar, crystallization of the sugar may occur. With too low a concen- 
tration, the jelly will mold more readily. It will also ferment more readily 
than a jelly with a higher concentration of sugar. Singh has reported that 
jellies made with less than 65 per cent of sugar molded unless the jelly 
containers were sterilized. 



172 JELLY 

Sterilization of the glasses, and having them dry and hot when the 
jelly is added, probably aid in preventing mold and also fermentation. 
Running melted paraffin over the top of the jelly so that it forms a com- 
plete seal is an aid in keeping it. 

Definition o£ Jelly 

This chapter would be incomplete without giving Goldthwaite's defini- 
tion of an ideal jelly. "Ideal fruit-jelly is a beautifully colored, transparent, 
palatable product obtained by so treating fruit-juice that the resulting mass 
will quiver, not flow, when removed from its mold ; a product with texture 
so tender that it cuts easily with a spoon, and yet so firm that the angles 
thus produced retain their shape ; a clear product that is neither sirupy, 
gummy, sticky, nor tough; neither is it brittle and yet it will break, and 
does this with distinct beautiful cleavage which leaves sparkling character- 
istic faces. This is that delicious, appetizing substance, a good fruit-jelly."

Directions for preparing fruit for jelly. Apples and crab-apples are 
washed but not pared. Remove bad spots and wormy places but retain 
the seeds and core, as they contain pectic substances. Cut in rather small 
pieces in order to more easily extract the pectin. Gooseberries and cur- 
rants are washed but do not need to be stemmed. Add sufficient water 
to cover apples and crab-apples. Green gooseberries can be covered with 
water; ripe ones should be only partially covered. For most berries about 
^ cup of water to a pint of berries is sufficient, or else the pectin of the 
juice will not be sufficiently concentrated. Cranberries may be used. Rather 
ripe cranberries should have a smaller proportion of water than less ripe 
ones. Drain the juice through a heavy cloth bag. Save the pulp for a second 
extraction. Water-packed canned gooseberries are excellent to use, as they 
are easily obtained at any time of the year. The number ten size is more 
economical. In using the canned gooseberries the juice is not cooked for 
the first extraction but drained without heating. 

Experiment 23. 

A. To determine the pectin content of fruit juice. 

To 45 or 60 cc. of alcohol in a graduate add 15 cc. of the juice to be tested. 
Invert the graduate slowly and turn back. A precipitate in a mass indicates 
enough pectin for jelly. Pour out in a dish and lift the pectin. (See p. 157.) 
If a quantitative test is desired, follow some standard directions for pectin 
determinations. 

B. Test the juice with a jelmeter. Add sugar and cook according to direc- 
tions furnished wnth the jelmeter. Compare the jellies with those made from 
the same juice under Experiment 24. 

Experiment 24. 

To determine the effect of varying the proportion of sugar to juice in making 
jelly. 

Use a first extraction of juice. Use 240 grams of juice for a cup and 200 
grams of sugar per cup. Add the sugar to the juice and boil until the tempera- 
ture is 103°C. Be sure that the temperature reaches 103°C. before removing 
from the stove; read to just above the 103 mark on the thermometer rather 
than below it. Pour into hot, dry, sterilized jelly glasses. Sterilize by boiling in 
hot water, then set in a place where they will stay hot before adding the jelly. 
With more than }i cup of sugar to a cup of juice, two of the 8-ounce jelly 
glasses will be needed to hold the jelly. If the percentage of sugar is to be 
determined in the finished jelly, weigh the pan and spoon before the juice 
is added. Weigh the pan, spoon, and contents on a balance as soon as the 
temperature of 103°C. has been reached, then pour into jelly glasses. Determine 



JELLY 



175 



the approximate yield of the jelly in cups by filling other jelly glasses with 
water to the same height as the jelly and then measure the water. This elimi- 
nates pouring the jelly into measuring cups and then into the jelly glasses. 

1. Boil 2 cups of fruit juice without the addition of sugar until the desired 
temperature is reached. Does it give the spoon jelly test? Obtain the volume, 
and label it, and set aside to jell. It is best to put this quantity of juice in a 
large pan so that it may boil rapidly, without boiling over. When the juice 
is concentrated to about Yi cup it may be transferred to a smaller pan, as the 
quantity of juice at the end of the experiment is so small that it is difficult to 
get an accurate reading with the thermometer. 

2. To 1 cup of juice add 34 cup of sugar. Cook until a temperature of 
103 °C. is reached. Pour into jelly glass. Obtain volume, label it, and set aside 
to jell. 

3. To 1 cup of juice add Yi cup of sugar. Follow directions under 2.

CHAPTER VI 
GELATIN 

Gelatin has been used extensively for experimental work in studying the 
reactions of colloidal substances, particularly in connection with gel forma-

Uses of gelatin in foods. In food preparation gelatin is used as a basis 
to make a flavored gel for salads and desserts. It is used as an emulsi- 
fying agent, to form a basis for some types of candy like marshmallows, 
and it is used in frozen desserts. 

Source of gelatin. Gelatin is obtained from collagen by hydrolysis. 
Collagen is a protein and is found in connective tissue, tendons, cartilage, 
in the organic part of bone tissue, in the inner layer of skin of animals, 
and in fish skins, scales, and ''sounds" or fish bladders. Collagen is not found 
as a pure substance in these tissues, but in combination with inorganic ma- 
terials and with other proteins like elastin, mucin, mucoid, etc. White con- 
nective tissue is found between the muscle fibers, in tendons, and in the 
inner layers of skin. It contains a high percentage of collagen. The jelly- 
ing of meat broth after cooling is due to the gelatin, which has been formed 
from the collagen of the connective tissue. Sometimes the concentration 
of the gelatin in the broth is not great enough to bring about the formation 
of a gel. When pieces of baked fish skins are allowed to cool on the baking 
pan, they adhere to it quite tenaciously, because of the adhesive quality 
of the gelatin or glue formed from the collagen of the fish skin. 

Distinction between Gelatin and Glue 

Commercially there is little distinction between gelatins and glues, ex- 
cept that edible gelatin is a high-grade product and complies with the Pure 
Food Laws. It contains only traces of harmful ingredients, and Bogue 
states that it should be made from ''such stock and by such sanitary 
methods, as not to be objectionable from the ethical point of view." Glue 
may be made from the same type of stock as the gelatin, but usually no 
effort is made to remove impurities. 

Manufacture of gelatin. In making edible gelatin the stock is or 
should be selected with greater care than for inedible gelatin or glue. Some 
edible gelatins are made entirely from bones. Others are made from calf- 
skin and others from pork skin. The bones of young animals contain more 
collagen than bones from older animals. For edible gelatin the bones are 

178 



ACIDS 179 

washed to free them from dirt, then degreased by extraction of fat by fat 
solvents. Next the soluble lime salts are removed by leaching the bones 
with acid. The principal salts in bone are the calcium phosphates, but some 
calcium carbonate and magnesium phosphate are also found. It is difficult 
to free the bones from all the traces of inorganic matter, and the elec- 
trolytes left influence the pH of the resulting gelatin. The degreased bone 
with the inorganic salts removed is known as ossein and contains the col- 
lagen from which the gelatin is made. The ossein is soaked in lime water. 
In the lime water and in acid solution the collagen swells. This swelling 
makes it possible to hydrolyze the collagen to gelatin at lower temperatures 
than would otherwise be possible. This is important in the manufacture of 
gelatin, for with higher temperatures or long heating the jellying strength 
of the gelatin is lessened. The gelatin is then dried. The gelatin thus 
obtained has some ash and is not at the isoelectric point, but on either the 
acid or alkaline side of the isoelectric point. Putrefaction by bacteria must 
be prevented during the manufacturing process, as the bacterial action 
lowers the grade of gelatin obtained and odors develop that remain in 
the finished gelatin even if putrefaction is later stopped. 

Market types of gelatin. Gelatin is put upon the market in three 
forms: granulated, pulverized, and sheet. The granulated is the form most 
commonly obtained. 

Sheppard and Hudson have reported a new form of gelatin. It is called 
pressed foam gelatin. It is said to absorb water rapidly and to dissolve 
rapidly and it is not excessively bulky. 

Hydrolysis of Collagen 

Temperature. When collagen is heated with water, gelatin is formed. 
Bogue states that this occurs at 80° to 90°C. or at higher temperatures. The 
reaction occurs more rapidly at higher temperatures, but at these tempera- 
tures more of the gelatin is hydrolyzed to proteoses, peptones, or amino 
acids. When meat is cooked in hot water the collagen of the connective 
tissue is converted to gelatin. The gelatin is soluble in the hot water, and 
as it is dissolved the muscle fibers are separated and fall apart. At tem- 
peratures below the boiling point of water a longer time is required to 
hydrolyze the collagen to gelatin. 

Acids. The addition of a dilute acid hastens the hydrolysis of collagen, 
but this also increases the hydrolysis of the gelatin to peptones and amino 
acids. The latter products do not form gels, so that, in the manufacture 
of gelatin, it is not desirable for the gelatin to contain very much of these 
products. Softening of connective tissue in cooking meat is brought 
about in a shorter time by the addition of a small amount of acid. 
Tomatoes added to a stew will accomplish this purpose. Sometimes vinegar 
is used.

Properties of Gelatin 

Gelatin Is characterized by forming a solution in water at high tem- 
peratures and, with high enough concentration, a gel at low temperatures. 
The dry gelatin has a slightly yellow cast and contains from 10 to 18 
per cent of moisture. It swells when put in cold water, the degree of 
swelling being modified by acids, alkalies, or salts. It dissolves at about 
35 °C., and it gels at low temperatures, the exact gelation temperature 
depending upon the concentration and time of standing. 

Swelling and Solution 

The extent to which gelatin swells in water is modified by the surface 
area, its initial /»H, the presence of or addition of acids, alkalies, and in- 
organic salts, and its previous history. Bogue states that gelatin tends to 
absorb water equal to the amount of water it held at the last warming, 
but not very much over this. Thus the degree of swelling Is modified by 
the previous history of the sample. This would include treatment during 
manufacture. 

Ease o£ hydration of gelatins. The pulverized gelatin swells most 
rapidly, for It Is finely divided, hence has a greater surface area. Granu- 
lated gelatin absorbs water quickly, not so rapidly as pulverized, but rapidly 
enough so that It Is easily used in the home. Sheet gelatin may be thin or 
rather thick. The thin form Is easily hydrated, but the thick does not 
hydrate so readily, and therefore requires longer soaking in cold water or 
a longer period of heating to dissolve. In preparing gelatin dishes the gela- 
tin Is usually allowed to soak In a small amount of cold water. During 
this soaking it swells. Bogue suggests that this swelling, by the formation 
of capillary spaces In the Interior of the gelatin particles. Increases the 
surface of the gelatin. 

Solution. According to Bogue, soaked gelatin goes Into solution more 
rapidly than unsoaked gelatin owing to solution occurring from the outer 
and inner surfaces, whereas If gelatin Is put In hot water before soaking, 
swelling Is Inhibited to a certain degree and solution takes place from the 
outer surface only. The process of solution may be analogous to hydrolysis 
of collagen. I.e., just as gelatin is formed more readily from the swollen 
collagen, so solution may take place more readily from the swollen gelatin. 
Very little of the gelatin goes Into solution while It Is soaking In cold 
water. When the temperature is Increased to about 35 °C. the gelatin goes 
into solution rapidly. For food preparation this is often accomplished by 
adding hot water to the hydrated gelatin. It can also be accomplished by 
melting the hydrated gelatin over hot water and then adding cold water 
or fruit juices. 



GELATION AND STIFFENING POWER OF GELATIN 181 

Initial pH. Bogue states that ordinary gelatin usually has a pH about 
7. The pH of different commercial brands used in the laboratory for food 
preparation has been found to vary from pH 5 to 7. The isoelectric point 
of gelatin is given as pH 4.7. At this point it is least soluble, least ionized 
and swells the least. Bogue has found turbidity and foaming to be at a 
maximum at the isoelectric point. Loeb states that 1 gram of dry gelatin 
at the isoelectric point absorbs 7 grams of vi^ater. As the />H is decreased 
below 4.7 or increased above 4.7, greater absorption of water occurs until 
a maximum is reached. Bogue states that it is desirable from the standpoint 
of solubility for the gelatin to have a pH of 3.0 to 3.5, or 8 to 9. The 
variation of the pH. of commercial gelatins is due to differences in salt 
content, which may increase the acidity or alkalinity. This acidity due to 
electrolytes, or to the treatment in acids and alkalies during manufacture, 
is often referred to as the residual acidity or alkalinity of the gelatin. 

Acids. At a pH below 4.7 the amount of water absorbed increases with 
increasing acidity until a maximum is reached at a pH of about 3.5. As 
the pH is lowered more than 3.5, the amount of water absorbed decreases. 
Loeb states that at a pH of 3.2 to 3.5 a gram of dry gelatin absorbs about 
35 grams of water. In food preparation the acid fruit juices are added 
after the gelatin is in solution, so that the extent of swelling during hydra- 
tion is affected by the initial acidity of the gelatin. In gelatin mixtures that 
contain acid salts, as acid phosphates and citric acid added for flavoring, 
the amount of swelling would be affected by the acidity. 

Alkalies, Alkalies have the same effect as acids upon the swelling of 
gelatin, except that it is not so pronounced. Bogue states that the maxi- 
mum swelling on the alkaline side is at pH 9. 

Salts. Salts also affect the water absorption of gelatin. Some salts in- 
hibit the swelling and others favor it. Ostwald states that when salts and 
acids are combined the salt usually decreases swelling below the amount 
which w^ould result in the presence of acid alone, even though the salt 
alone may increase swelling. Sugar decreases swelling. Loeb states that, if 
the pH of the solution is kept constant, all ions of the same valency and 
charge have nearly the same depressing effect upon swelling. The depress- 
ing effect increases with increasing valency. 

Gelation and Stiffening Power o£ Gelatin 

Gelation is the formation of a gel or solidification of a gelatin solution. 
In food preparation it is referred to as the setting of the gelatin. The 
setting point is no clearly defined point. The gelatin solution becomes 
sirupy, like a thick sugar solution, then gradually thickens to finally form 
a firm gel. Thus there is no distinct point at which solidification occurs. 
If samples of solutions are placed in test tubes, the time at which they 
cease to flow may be taken as the setting point. In larger containers this 
is not so easy to ascertain, and it is necessary for members of the class to 



182 GELATIN 

compare results and all try to select a definite stiffness as the setting point. 
Sheppard and Sweet devised an apparatus for determining the setting point. 
They take the setting point as the point at which a stream of air bubbles 
ceases to flow through the gelatin solution. 

The stiffening power and the viscosity of gelatin are affected by several 
factors. Usually stiffening power and viscosity run parallel, but this is 
not always true, for gelatins giving the highest viscosity do not always 
yield the stiffest jellies. Viscosity of gelatin is measured at a temperature 
of 35 °C. by some workers and at 60 °C. by others. At these temperatures 
gelatin is a liquid and will flow. Viscosity is measured by the rate of flow 
under standardized conditions; stiffening power or jelly strength is meas- 
ured when the gelatin is set. 

Different brands of gelatin show decided differences in stiffening power 
when made into gelatin to serve. If two gelatins cost the same per pound, 
one may be more economical than the other, if equal quantities of the 
gelatins when combined with the same amounts of sugar, water, and flavor- 
ing show different stiffening power. 

Time, concentration, and temperature all affect the gelation process and 
the stiffness of the resulting jelly. 

Time of gelation. When concentration and temperature are constant 
a definite length of time is necessary for gelation to occur. This is character- 
istic of many colloidal changes. With lessened concentration a longer time 
is required for gelation. At higher temperatures a longer time is required 
for the solidification to take place. 

The firmness of the jelly is also affected by time. Some time may be 
required after the gelatin solution has cooled to the refrigerator tempera- 
ture before gelation occurs. The jelly becomes stiffer with longer standing. 
Gelatins allowed to stand in the refrigerator over night at a temperature 
of 8° to 10°C. are stiffer than those standing only a short time after 
gelation has occurred. Clark and Du Bois state that after gelatin has cooled 
3 hours at 0°C. little or no further increase in jelly strength occurs. 
Dahlberg, Carpenter, and Hening found that, for the weak gelatin solu- 
tions used in ice cream, gel formation requires a long period of time. They 
allowed 18 hours for gel formation and aging in most of their experiments. 
However, they found that the gumminess in ice cream due to too much 
gelatin increased during 4 to 5 weeks' storage of the ice cream. They 
attributed this to the ''slow rate at which gelatin gels in weak concentra- 
tions come to a final equilibrium." 

Concentration. With a definite temperature and time, solidification 
occurs only with a definite concentration. With increasing concentration 
of gelatin the time for setting is shortened. The amount of liquid that 
a gram of dry gelatin can bind and hold in the form of a gel is high, 1 to 
2 grams forming a gel with 99 to 98 grams of water. 

Ostwald states, that the solidification of gelatin in Yi hour depends upon 
the mode of preparation, but usually requires about 2 per cent at 15°C. 



"SEEDING" GELATIN SOLS 183 

and 1 per cent at 0°C. To serve as food the concentration should not be 
too high, or the jelly is too stiff to be desirable. Some food gelatins pro- 
duce a desirable texture for serving w^ith a 1.5 per cent concentration, 
some require 2 per cent, and some may require as much as 3 or 4 per cent. 

Manufacturers often place a quantity of gelatin in a packet or envelope 
and state the amount of vrater to be used with it. This amount of w^ater 
is an average amount required under all conditions for cooling. In some 
instances it might be desirable to change it, on account of variation in 
proportion of ingredients or variation in temperatures at which it solidifies, 
or for other reasons. Recipes containing sauces thickened with egg or 
starch do not need so high a concentration of gelatin. 

It is preferable to use bulk or sheet gelatin by weight, rather than by 
measure. On account of differences in the size of the gelatin particles, 
a definite measure does not yield the same weight, hence a different concen- 
tration of the gelatin would be used. 

Temperature. With a definite concentration and time for setting, solidi- 
fication occurs only with a definite temperature. For a high solidifying 
temperature a high concentration of gelatin is required. The slower a 
gelatin solution is cooled, the higher the temperature at which it solidifies. 
A gelatin solution may be cooled down, by packing ice around its container, 
to a temperature below that at which setting would occur if a longer 
time is allowed. On the other hand, gelatin solutions may be mixed and 
left standing for 2 or 3 hours at room temperature. If they are then put 
in ice or the refrigerator they set quite rapidly and as if gel nuclei might 
have started to form while standing at room temperature. At low tempera- 
tures all gelatins become firmer. At high temperatures they are liquid, 
for no gel occurs at temperatures above 35 °C. with any concentration of 
gelatin. With the same concentration one gel may set at 10°C., another 
at 12°, still another at 14° to 16°C., and others require lower tempera- 
tures for setting. The gelatins that set at higher temperatures show jellies 
of greater firmness than those that set at low temperatures. The ones 
requiring lower temperatures than 10°C. to set do not serve very well, 
for they also soften at a low temperature. 

Addition of solidified gelatin to a gel solution. Lloyd states that 
gelation is similar to crystallization, in that it takes place from a saturated 
solution. There are various theories to account for gel formation. It has 
been suggested that nuclei, strands, rods, or micelles form in the solution 
and solidification takes place upon cooling, with the formation of a gel 
structure. If some gelatin that has solidified is added to freshly made 
gelatin solution solidification takes place more rapidly. Alexander suggests 
that this is due to the addition of nuclei, and that other particles aggregate 
around these nuclei. This is similar to "seeding" or adding of crystals to 
crystalloidal solutions to hasten crystallization. Dahlberg, Carpenter, and 
Hening find that this property of gelatin has a practical application in 
ice-cream making. The gelatin is added to ice cream to improve the texture 



184 GELATIN 

and body of the ice cream. If the unfrozen ice-cream mix is aged at a 
temperature just above the freezing point a smoother ice cream is obtained. 
One reason attributed for this is the low viscosity of the freshly made 
gelatin solutions compared with the viscosity of the aged solutions, and 
another is the speed at which the gelatin gel previously aged reforms 
after whipping during freezing. 

Hydrogen-ion concentration. The acidity of the gelatin affects its 
stififening power. According to the kind and amount of ash and its buffer 
action the gelatin may have a hydrogen-ion concentration greater or less 
than its isoelectric point, which is />H 4.7. The initial pH of different 
brands and samples tried in the laboratory has been above the isoelectric 
point. Probably the greater the acidity or alkalinity, unless it is beyond the 
maximum or minimum pH for the greatest water absorption, the less firm 
the resulting jelly. However, the pH of a gelatin solution does not entirely 
control the time for setting or the stiffness of the resulting gelatin. Two 
gelatin solutions may have the same pH and the same proportions of ingredi- 
ents added, but one may require much longer than the other to set and never 
produce as firm a jelly. 

Acids and alkalies. The addition of fruit juices or acid salts to the 
gelatin solution increases its acidity, the increase depending on the acidity 
of the fruit juice added, its buffer capacity, and the quantity added. Lemon 
juice has a lower pH than most fruit juices. Its pH varies slightly but 
is usually between 2.0 and 2.5. The addition of ^ cup of lemon juice 
to ^ ounce of gelatin with an initial pH 6 to 6.5, 3^^ cups of water and 
y2 cup of sugar, lowers the pH of the mixture around 3. This is lower 
than the isoelectric point of the gelatin. Many recipes use larger quantities 
of lemon juice than the proportion given above. This would increase the 
acidity still more. With a definite concentration of gelatin a less firm jelly 
is obtained as the amount of lemon juice is increased. A longer time is 
also required for the gelatin to set with the increased lemon juice or 
acidity. 

Patten and Johnson found that a 3 per cent gelatin solution liquefied 
on standing when the pH was sufficiently low. Liquefaction also varied 
with the temperature. It occurred at a temperature of 18°C. when the 
gelatin solution was at pH 3.6 or lower. 

Some of the less acid fruit juices do not increase the acidity of the gelatin 
mixture as much as the lemon juice. The addition of fruit or vegetable 
juices such as tomato juice may bring the pH of the gelatin close to its 
isoelectric point. The pH of tomato juice varies somewhat but is usually 
between 4.2 and 4.8. The juices that bring the gelatin close to the isoelec- 
tric point do not increase the time required for gelation to the extent that 
the lemon juice does. Gelatin made with tomato juice varies in the length 
of time required for setting. But in recipes lemon juice is usually added 
in combination with other fruit juices, and either lemon or vinegar is 
often added with tomato juice for tomato gelatins. Recipes containing a 



SUGAR 185 

larger quantity of a very acid fruit juice may need a higher concentration 
of gelatin to produce a texture desired for serving. 

Lemon jellies were made from the same sample of gelatin, using different 
proportions of lemon juice. When the quantity of lemon juice added Vi^as 
just sufficient to bring the hydrogen-ion concentration of the mixture to 
about pH 4.7, the isoelectric point of gelatin, the jelly formed w^as cloudy 
and more turbid than when the pH of the mixture was lower than 4.7. 
Jellies with a pH lower than the isoelectric point of gelatin were clear 
and sparkling. They also required a longer time for the gel to form than 
those with a higher pH. When the series was repeated but citric acid was 
substituted for lemon juice, similar results were obtained. 

Tartaric acid added to the gelatin solution also increases the time for 
gelation. A teaspoon of tartaric acid (about 3.5 grams) or a teaspoon of 
citric acid (about 3.5 grams) added to 3.5 grams of gelatin and 236.5 cc. 
of water gives the mixture about />H 2.7. The jellies are clear and tart. 

Patten and Johnson have reported that a 3 per cent solution of gelatin 
at 20° to 22°C. begins to liquefy between a pH of 8.4 and a pH of 9.2. 
It is not completely fluid at />H 9.6. 

Salts. It has been reported by several investigators that the gelation tem- 
perature is affected by electrolytes. The effect is usually given as follows 
for anions at equal concentrations. The first of the series elevates the 
gelation temperature, and it is slightly lower for each following anion, 
until the iodide may lower the gelation temperature below 0°C. SO4 > 
citrate > tartrate > acetate > CI > CIO3 > NO3 > Br > I. This is the 
order above the isoelectric point. When enough lemon juice or acid has been 
added so that the reaction is below the isoelectric point the cations may have 
more effect than the anions. The order of anions given above indicates that 
some salts would increase the tenderness of gelatin gels whereas others 
would increase the gel strength. 

Dahlberg, Carpenter, and Hening found that the gel strength was 
greater in milk than in water, even when the proportion of gelatin added 
to the milk was based on the water content of the milk and not on its total 
volume or weight. They found that the change in hydrogen-ion concen- 
tration did not account for this increase in jelly strength in all the samples. 
The other factors that might influence the jelly strength were the salt 
and protein content of the milk. They state that the "influence of salts 
on gel strength has been observed by other investigators, so it may be one 
of the means by which skim milk altered gel strength." 

Sugar. Small amounts of non-electrolytes do not appreciably affect 
the viscosity of gelatin solutions, but in large quantities sugar increases 
the viscosity, as a thick sugar sirup is more viscous than a thin one. Loeb 
has reported that cane sugar does not diminish the viscosity of gelatin solu- 
tions, but at concentrations of M/S or over may increase it slightly. The 
sugar has a similar effect upon the stiffening power. Some concentrations 
of sugar do not seem to affect the stiffening power, but others do. Ostwald 



186 GELATIN 

states that 1 gram of sugar added to 9 cc. of a 6 per cent gelatin solution 
accelerates gelation. This would give about 10 per cent of sugar in the 
solution. Larger quantities of sugar may retard gelation. 

Opacity in gelatin. Edwards states that two factors of prime impor- 
tance in gelatin are its strength and clarity of aqueous solution. In regard 
to clarity he says that many perplexing problems occur in this connection, 
for a gelatin may be clear at one concentration but, if further diluted, 
may appear turbid. He says that a complete explanation of the problem 
of turbidity has yet to be made, but some causes are as follows : ( 1 ) actual 
dirt, particles of animal tissue and fibers, (2) mold, (3) emulsified grease 
and calcium salts of fatty acids, (4) protein salts and proteins other than 
gelatin which precipitate and remain in suspension when the /)H of the 
solution is varied, (5) a calcium sulfate-phosphate complex which is re- 
tained in solution by the presence of sulfurous acid, and (6) colloidal sulfur. 

Edwards states that the first two enumerated difficulties should not be 
present and when detected the gelatin should be condemned. Emulsified 
grease is more difficult to remove. It results from the employment of 
greasy material, extraction of gelatin at the wrong pH, the agitation of 
liquid in the boiling vat, and improper filtration. The presence of proteins 
other than gelatin is more likely to occur in a skin gelatin. Mucin and 
chondrin are readily soluble in weak alkalies and are thrown out of solu- 
tion by acids. Hence they are less likely to be found in acid gelatins. 
Cloudiness due to the presence of insoluble calcium sulfate-phosphate com- 
plex is more likely to be found in ossein gelatins. Colloidal sulfur is more 
likely to be found in glue than in gelatin stock. 

Gelatin is used in the meat trade for packing tongues, chickens, and 
glazing hams. Sometimes a cloudy precipitate appears which is caused by 
too much calcium in the gelatin. 

Black mentions that unless the copper content of the gelatin is low a 
purplish discoloration may appear with meats and particularly with 
chicken and tongues. 

Another cause for turbidity is discussed by Clayton. At the isoelectric 
point the gelatin solutions always show more turbidity, a 400 per cent 
increase in turbidity occurring with a pK variation of 0.03 (pH 4.87 to 
4.90). Gelatin stock treated with lime shows greatest turbidity on the acid 
side of the isoelectric point and, vice versa, those stocks treated with acid 
possess isoelectric points in the region of pH 7 to 8. 

Previous history. The temperature to which a gelatin has been pre- 
viously heated will cause a variation in its viscosity. It may also change 
its stiffening power. This heating may be due to heating during manufac- 
ture or to heating for dissolving in the home. The latter is seldom long 
enough to destroy the jelly strength to any appreciable extent. A gelatin 
solution that has solidified and then is melted will form a gel in a shorter 
time for the second or third gelation.

Agitation and foam formation. Bogue and Alexander both state that 
agitation or stirring lessens the viscosity of gelatin solutions. This might 
also affect the jelly strength. Gelatins are often beaten when they have 
become thick but not firmly set. The beating incorporates air, forming a 
foam, and the gelatin mixture increases in volume. Bogue states that the 
ability for gelatin to form a foam is greatest at the isoelectric point. At 
this point the gelatin particles have a strong tendency to adhere to each 
other, and this favors foam formation. If the beating is done at the time 
when the gelatin has set enough to be quite viscid, but has not become 
brittle, so that the edges break apart, the volume may be increased two or 
three times that of the original unbeaten gelatin. The lessening of firmness 
may be partially due to agitation of the gelatin, but part is due to the 
incorporation of air. The gelatin at this stage is elastic and stretches to 
surround the air particles. The gelatin that is to be beaten should have 
the flavoring in larger quantity than for an unbeaten gelatin as the increase 
in volume causes the flavor to seem less concentrated. If gelatin becomes 
too firm before the beating is started the gelatin only breaks and air is not 
incorporated. Whipped cream and beaten egg white are often folded into 
unbeaten gelatin or into beaten gelatin.

GELATIN 

Directions for cooling gelatin. The gelatin solutions should be put 
to cool at the same temperature. Those from the same experiment should 
be on the same shelf in the refrigerator, as the upper shelves have a higher 
temperature than the lower ones. A cooling room is a splendid place to 
put them while cooling. For class work when periods are short the setting 
may be hastened by putting the containers in crushed ice. The ice should 
be the same depth around all the containers. It is better to have all the 
containers for one experiment in the same pan of ice for cooling. The 
containers should be the same size, shape, and material, for if they are not 
the same size the surface area for cooling will be greater for some than 
for others. Enamel or aluminum are good materials for cooling gelatin 
solutions. Crockery or china cools more slowly than metal. 

The proportion of gelatin suggested in the following experiments, 3.5 
grams for a cup of liquid, is not the best proportion for all gelatins. 
With some brands or grades about 2 per cent or about 4.8 grams per cup 
of liquid will be required for the best results. Find the best proportion 
of gelatin for the brand that is being used and substitute that amount for 
the amount given in the experiments. Use the same brand for all the 
experiments except Experiment 30. 

Record the time and temperature when the gelatin is mixed, when it 
begins to gel around the edges, and when set. If cooled in crushed fee 
make a record of the temperature every 5 minutes and plot on graph paper. 
Find the effect on the texture of the gelatin of standing 20 minutes at

room temperature. Most gelatins will need to stand at least 20 minutes 
or longer for serving. 

Experiment 29. 

To determine the effect of dissolving gelatin by different methods on the 
time required for setting and the temperature at which gelation occurs. 

A. Hydrate 3.5 grams of gelatin with 30 cc. of cold water. Add 206.5 cc. 
of boiling water. Stir until dissolved. Record the temperature when mixed and 
the time when mixed. Set in crushed ice. Record time and temperature every 
5 minutes or more often until set. Plot on graph paper. 

B. Hydrate 3.5 grams of gelatin with 30 cc. of cold water. Let stand 5 
minutes, then melt over hot water. The temperature of the hot water should 
be 85 to 90°C. Stir the gelatin until melted, remove from above the hot water 
and add gradually while stirring 206.5 cc. of cold water. Follow directions for 
cooling under A. 

C. Hydrate 3.5 grams of gelatin with 30 cc. of cold water for 5 minutes. 
Stir while adding 60 cc. of boiling water. After gelatin is dissolved add 131.5 
cc. of cold water. Follow directions for cooling under A. Compare the length 
of time required for setting, the temperature at which setting occurs, and the 
ease of dissolving by each method. 

What proportion of an ounce is 3.5 grams? What proportion of an envelope 
of gelatin? What is the measure in teaspoons? A total of 240 grams of liquid

gelatin solution. Use a total of 240 grams of gelatin and liquid. Compare the 
length of time required to set and the firmness of the jellies. Do any of the 
gelatins require too long a time to set to serve in a reasonable time? Are any 
of the gelatins too firm?

CHAPTER VII 

MEAT 

Grading and Stamping o£ Meat 

Federal grading and stamping of meat was inaugurated in 1927. Davis 
states that because the government grading is not influenced by season, 
geographical location, or any other factor, the purchaser is assured, whether 
by long distance or over-the-counter sales, of always securing, within cer- 
tain narrow limits, the same quality of meat when buying a definite United 
States grade. The service has grown until United States graded meat can 
be purchased in many, though not all retail markets. 

Classes of meat. Bovine animals are divided, because of characteristics 
at different ages, into veal, calves, vearlings, and mature beef. Sometimes 
baby beeves are given as a separate group between calves and yearlings. 
The usual trade practise is to group baby beeves with yearlings. Sheep are 
divided into lambs, yearlings, and mutton. The division into classes is based 
on sex. Thus the classes of beef are steer-, heifer-, cow-, bull-, and stag- 
beef. Carcasses from each class are further subdivided into grades. Grading 
divides, in so far as possible, the carcasses, or subdivisions thereof, of the 
uncooked meat into groups, the various grades indicating the relative 
desirability of the meat for ultimate consumption, there being no exact 
dividing line between one grade and that just higher or lower. 

Basis for grading. The basis for grading is on what the grader calls 
quality, conformation, and finish. Quality in so far as appearance can fore- 
tell includes relative tenderness, juiciness, and palatability. By conforma- 
tion is meant the form or shape, animals having broad, large, full muscles, 
with relatively smaller proportion of bone, being graded highest. Finish 
refers to the amount, quality, and color of fat w^ithin and around the 
muscle. A few points considered in grading do not always affect the 
palatability of the meat. For example, the fat of beef usually becomes more 
yellow with age, so that whiter fat is graded higher than creamy or more 
yellow fat. Yet in animals of the same age the deeper yellow color of the 
fat indicates that the animal with more yellow fat had more carotene in its 
feed. If conformation and finish both rated high, the meat from the animal 
with yellow fat would undoubtedly be as palatable and also have more 
nutritive value than meat from an animal with white fat. Grass-fed ani- 
mals, because the meat is darker in color, may be graded lower, even when 
all other points rate high.

196 MEAT 

United States grading is a promiscuous service. The grading may 
be done by federal graders or by the packers, but if by the packers only for 
packer grades. If done by federal graders the meat is stamped with the 
class of animal and the United States grade. See Fig. 19. The service is 
paid for by the buyer of the meat. Grading is not a compulsory service 
but a promiscuous one. Davis states the cost of grading varies in different 
establishments in proportion to the number of carcasses graded and stamped. 
But the cost is small, being less than 1/20 of a cent a pound. Hence, any 
extra cost to the consumer should be largely for the quality obtained rather 
than the cost of stamping. Grading insures the purchaser of uniform 
quality, and both buyer and purchaser use the same terminology for 
specifications and qualifications. In Seattle and in some other cities, all 
retail cuts must be plainly labeled with the United States grade. 

Grades. In general classes of carcasses are divided into seven or six 
United States grades, though pork because it is more uniform in quality 
than beef or mutton has only four grades. Steer- and heifer-beef are divided 
into seven grades, but cow-, bull-, and stag-beef are divided into six 
grades, the top grade. Prime, being omitted. Lamb and mutton are divided 
into six grades. 

The seven United States beef grades are designated by both a name and 
a number and follow: No. Al, Prime; No. 1, Choice; No. 2, Good; No. 3, 
Medium; No. 4, Common; No. 5, Cutter; and No. 6, Low Cutter. The 
grades for lamb and mutton are similar to those for beef, except that No. 5 
is called Cull and there is no No. 6. The pork grades are No. 1, No. 2, 
No. 3, and Cull. 

The stamp indicating the grade is put on with a roller. The material 
used for stamping is an edible, vegetable compound which often disappears 
during cooking. Stamping starts at the shank, continues over the round, 
the rump, the loin, along the back over the prime-rib beef cuts, and to the 
neck. See Fig. 19. In beef another line is put over the shoulder. Thus the 
stamp indicating grade occurs on all major retail cuts. Although, as has 
been indicated, all the grades may be stamped, in actual practise the bulk 
of the beef that has been graded and stamped has been the Prime, Choice, 
and Good grades of steers and heifers. Some Choice cow-beef is stamped. 
Only a small amount of steer- and heifer-beef below Good is graded and 
practically no bull- or stag-beef is graded. 

The proportion of classes to total beef, in percentage, for a 30-month 
period, July 1, 1918, to Dec. 31, 1920, are given by Davis and Whalin as 
follows: Steer, 49.94; bull and stag, 3.57; cow, 36.53; and heifer-beef, 
14.96. 

The approximate distribution of steer-beef by grades is given by Davis 
and Whalin as follows: Prime, about 0.5; Choice, 4; Good, 22; Medium, 
53 ; Common, 17 ; and Cutter and Low Cutter combined about 3.5 per cent. 

Very little of the two lowest grades can be purchased on the retail 



TRICHINOSIS 197 

market, practically all of the meat, except that used for boneless cuts such 
as tenderloin, being used in products like sausage. 

Packer brands. Packers designate their better quality of meat by brand 
names. If the United States grade is stamped on the meat the packer brand 
is not used. 

Federal Inspection of Meat 

All meats shipped from one state to another are under federal surveil- 
lance. This includes the meat produced by the larger establishments, about 
two-thirds of that consumed. Each state and the cities usually have some 
regulations concerning meats and supervision of local plants. 

The purpose of inspection is to insure that the meat sold to the Con- 
sumer is from healthy animals, in sound condition at the time of slaughter. 

The inspection stamp is round and is placed on each wholesale cut and 
on all grades of meat. In Fig. 19, the four round stamps are inspection 
stamps placed on what will be the wholesale cuts of round, rump, sirloin, 
and short loin. 

Inspection of carcasses and the supervision of making of meat products 
safeguard the consumer. However, in one instance, inspection cannot 
entirely safeguard the consumer. There is no accurate, quick method that 
can be used in inspection that detects trichinae in trichinae-infected pork, 
though federal supervision does insure that products to be consumed with- 
out further cooking are so treated that no live trichinae are present. It 
should be stated that only a small percentage of pork is infected with 
trichinae. 

Trichinosis. Trichinosis is contracted by eating uncooked, trichinae- 
infected meat, usually pork. Any animal eating pork may contract the 
disease, however, and cases have been reported in the medical literature 
that were traced to the eating of raw, jerked bear meat. 

It is assumed that anyone buying fresh pork chops, roasts, etc., will cook 
the meat. But some people grind raw lean pork, season it, and use it in 
sandwiches. Others in making homemade sausage taste the uncooked 
product to see that the seasoning is satisfactory. 

Ransom and Schwartz found that live trichinae are quickly destroyed by 
heating the meat to 55 °C. They may be destroyed at 50°C. if the meat is 
held at this temperature for a sufficient time. Ransom found that trichinae 
are destroyed by freezing, provided the frozen, infected meat is held at a 
temperature not higher than 5°F. for 10 days. 

All lean pork, in plants under federal supervision, used with other meat, 
or in pork products that are to be consumed without further cooking, must 
be treated to make sure that any live trichinae that may be present are 
destroyed. Such products include soft or fresh and dry summer sausages, 
frankfurters and Vienna-style sausages, Italian and Westphalian-style hams, 



198 MEAT 

pork butts in casings, cured pork loins in or without casings, capicola, coppa, 
cotto salami, and other products. 

In general the methods used for destruction of trichinae are ( 1 ) freezing 
and storage and (2) heating, or a combination of one or more of these 
methods. 

The freezing treatment is called refrigeration. The lean pork and pork 
trimmings are frozen. The specifications, based on the work of Ransom and 
allowing 10 extra days for a margin of safety, are that the frozen meat 
must be stored for 20 days at a temperature not higher than 5°F. 

Heating is called processing. The specifications, based on the work of 
Ransom and Schwartz and allowing a margin for safety, are that the meat 
must be heated to 58.3°C. (137°F.). Some products may be heated to 
only 128°F. but must be held at this temperature, often in a smoke room, 
for a specified number of hours. 

Salt treatment is used for some products, but a large amount, 4.5 per 
cent, of salt must be used and a dry cure employed. The meat must be 
held in this salt cure for a period of 20 to 25 days at specified temperatures 
and further specific procedures must be followed. 

Definition of Meat and Flesh 

The Food and Drug Administration in "The Service and Regulatory 
Announcements of 1933" define meat and flesh as follows: "Meat is the 
properly dressed flesh derived from cattle, from swine, from sheep or goats 
sufficiently mature and in good health at the time of slaughter, but is 
restricted to that part of the striated muscle which is skeletal or that which 
is found in the tongue, in the diaphragm, in the heart, or in the esophagus, 
and does not include that found in the lips, in the snout, or in the ears, 
with or without the accompanying and overlying fat, and the portions of 
bone, sinew, nerve, and blood vessels which normally accompany the flesh 
and which may not have been separated from it in the process of dressing 
it for sale. 

"Flesh is any edible part of the striated muscle of an animal. The term 
'animal' as herein used, indicates a mammal, a fowl, a fish, a crustacean, 
a mollusk, or any other animal used as a source of food." 

Muscles 

A muscle is an organ made up of fibers held together by connective 
tissue and surrounded by a sheath of heavier connective tissue. The fibers 
are grouped parallel to each other in bundles called fasciculi. See Fig. 20. 
Even the thinner sheets of connective tissue entering the bundle are shown 
in some portions of the photograph. The connective tissue entering the 
fasciculi is the endomysium. The size of the bundles or fasciculi varies in 
different muscles and determines to a certain extent the grain of the meat. 



TENDER AND LESS TENDER CUTS 199 

The connective tissue surrounding the fasciculi, the perimysium, varies 
in thickness, being quite perceptible to the eye in some muscles, as in the 
outer muscle of prime ribs shown in Fig. 20. In some muscles it is scarcely 
discernible. The connective tissue enclosing each muscle is known as the 
epimysium or muscle sheath. The thicker, denser portions of the muscle 
sheath are often little changed during cooking and constitute tough spots 
in the meat. 




Fig. 20. — ^This photograph shows the bundles of muscle fibers, the fasciculi, and 
the surrounding connective tissue, the perimysium. Even the connective tissue 
entering the bundles of muscle fibers is shown in many places. This muscle is the 
narrow muscle along the outer edge of a beef roast. The photograph was taken 
after the meat was cooked. The muscle is pulled apart and pinned back. Enlarged 
about three times. 

The spaces between the muscles, the fasciculi, or the cells are referred to 
as intermuscular, interfascicular, or intercellular; the area within the 
muscle, the fasciculus, or cell is called intramuscular, intrafasgicular, or 
intracellular. 

Classes of muscles. Muscles are divided into two groups, the skeletal, 
voluntary, or cross-striated and the smooth, plain, or long-striated. The 
smooth muscles occur in the walls of the hollow viscera, i.e., the intestinal 
tract, the arteries, veins, etc. Heart muscle is cross-striated but in many 
of its characteristics it falls between the two groups, voluntary and invol- 
untary. The skeletal and heart muscles compose the muscle designated as 
flesh by the Food and Drug Administration. 

Some muscles are exercised more than others. The muscles in the 
body of an animal are not exercised or used equally. Thus, depending upon 



200 MEAT 

the extent to which the muscles have been used, "tender" and "less-tender" 
cuts are obtained from the same animal. In general the less-tender cuts are 
obtained from the neck and legs, the tender cuts along the back. 

Fat 

Fat may be deposited around and between each muscle, i.e., inter- 
muscularly; between the fasciculi, interf ascicularly ; between the fibers, 
intrafascicularly; or within the fiber, intracellularly. The nodular white 
spaces between the fibers, Fig. 21, were occupied by fat cells, i.e., intra- 
fascicular fat. The fat was removed in preparation of the section, but the 
membrane between the fat cells still shows. Although fat deposited around 
and within the muscle is not important in the contraction of the muscle, 
that around the muscle, and particularly in roasts, bastes the roast during 
cooking and thus afifects the palatability. 

Fat content. The fat content of the body, and hence of the muscles 
and finally the "cuts" of meat, varies with the nutritive condition and age 
of the animal. Well-nourished animals have more fat distributed over and 
throughout the muscles. In general older animals tend to deposit more fat 
within and around the muscle than young ones. 

It is generally conceded that the presence of fat around and particularly 
within the muscle increases the juiciness of the meat. Some water is de- 
posited with the fat and this, combined with melted fat is probably 
responsible for the apparent increased juiciness. 

Some cuts contain more fat. Cuts coming from certain locations con- 
tain relatively more fat than cuts from other parts of the body. Fat tends 
to be deposited first subcutaneously and around the internal organs. In 
general deposition of fat intermuscularly and intramuscularly comes later, 
and last of all its deposit within the individual fibers. The deposition of 
fat within the lean tissues is known as marbling, which undoubtedly in- 
creases the palatability of the meat. But to secure marbled muscular tissues 
a rather thick fat covering is essential (i.e., the portion of the cut lying 
beneath the skin) and, because meat is eaten primarily for its lean content, 
many housewives think this fat covering of the muscles is unnecessary. The 
fat covering differs in thickness in various cuts so that no definite statement 
can be made as to the most desirable thickness. But for a prime rib roast 
most persons prefer a covering of about ^ inch, some liking more and 
others less. The fat covering can become so thick and heavy that it does 
not materially increase the palatability and is wasteful. 

Adipose tissue. Adipose tissue is largely made up of fat cells within 
connective tissue. For human fatty tissue Burns gives the composition : 
water 15 per cent, fat 82.5 per cent, and protein 2.5 per cent. Gortner 
states that adipose tissue often contains as much as or more water than it 
does fat.

narrow, white spaces. The burled looking part of the fibers is due to pulling of the

202 MEAT 

Size o£ fat cells. The size of the fat cells varies with the nutritional 
state of the animal. Hammond states that they may be 10 to 20/x in a starved 
animal, 50/x in one in ordinary condition, and up to 175/x in a very fat one. 
The cells are smaller within the connective tissue and in the marbling fat 
within the muscles and larger around the internal organs and sub- 
cutaneously. 

Connective Tissue 

Hammond states, that there is evidence that the connective tissues go on 
growing longer than other tissues in the body, and that maturity in them 
is not reached so soon as in other tissues. This may be one explanation of 
why meat from older animals is in general tougher than meat from younger 
animals. Hammond says that with increased feeding fat is deposited in 
the connective tissue. 

Kinds of connective tissue. The connective tissue of meat is com- 
posed of two kinds, the yellow and the white. The amount and kind vary 
in meat from different animals and in different cuts from the same animal. 
Burns states that the function of the tissue governs the form produced. 
When binding power alone is required the white tissue is formed, but 
when elasticity as well as strength is necessary, there the yellow tissue is 
found. Tendons are composed almost entirely of the white, non-elastic 
tissue; ligaments are principally the yellow tissue. Many muscles seem to 
require both elastic and binding tissue, hence both are often found in the 
connective tissue binding the fibers. 

The yellow connective tissue is feebly but perfectly elastic and is found 
in ligaments, in the connective tissue between the muscle fibers, in the 
walls of the blood vessels, and in other parts of the body. The best example 
of the yellow tissue is the ligamentum nuchae of the ox. It is the tough 
yellow ligament found along the backbone, which is used in elevating the 
head of the animal ; it is much thicker and heavier along the ribs and fore 
quarter than along the loin. 

The white connective tissue is non-elastic and is found in the connective 
tissue between the muscle fibers and in the tendons, the tendon Achilles 
being a good example. 

Composition of connective tissue. The percentage of water in the 
connective tissue of the young animal is higher than in the older animal. 
Buerger and Gies have reported that the white connective tissue of the 
calf contains about 68 per cent of water, whereas that of the ox has about 
63 per cent. The solids of the connective tissue are made up of inorganic 
and organic matter. Buerger and Gies have reported the following com- 
position of the tendon Achilles of the ox; Vandergrift and Gies have 
reported the composition of ligamentum nuchae of the ox. 

The collagen and elastin content of connective tissue are of especial

interest in meat cookery, for both are found in the connective tissue 
betw^een the muscle fibers, but heat and moisture affect the two differently. 

Collagen. Table 24 shows that the white connective tissue contains 
nearly 32 per cent of collagen and about 7 per cent of elastin. Collagen 
in the presence of moisture and at high temperatures yields gelatin. Bogue 
states that collagen is changed to gelatin more rapidly at the boiling 
temperature of water, or at temperatures above boiling obtained by pres- 
sure, and more slowly at temperatures below boiling. The gelatin is dis- 
solved in the water or broth. If the meat is cooked long enough, the larger 
part of the connective tissue is dissolved, so that the muscle fibers may fall 
entirely apart. Sometimes in cooked meat only the outer portion of the 
fibers is separated and the inner portion is still connected. The surface of 
the meat reaches a high temperature before the interior of the meat, thus 
the collagen of the connective tissue near the surface may be changed to 
gelatin first. 

Elastin. Vandergrift and Gies have reported the yellow connective 
tissue as containing about 32 per cent of elastin and about 2 per cent of 
collagen. The elastin is a very resistant, firm protein and is not changed 
or affected by heat and moisture. In cooking, yellow connective tissue is 
not softened. Consequently cuts of meat containing large amounts of 
elastin in the connective tissue will be tough after cooking, whereas cuts 
containing large amounts of collagen may have part or all of the collagen 
changed to gelatin.

LESS TENDER CUTS HAVE MORE CONNECTIVE TISSUE 205 

Less tender cuts have more connective tissue. Data given in Table 
25 are from the earlier work of Mitchell et al., so that the percentage of 
elastin given is too high, but the comparative amounts in different cuts are 
shown. 

In later work Mitchell and co-workers found that the percentage of 
elastin in muscle is small, but in general the less tender contain a larger 
proportion than the tender cuts. 

From the experiments, results given in Table 26, Mitchell et al. find 
no relation between the ordinary market grading of beef carcasses and the 
connective-tissue content, the eye-muscle of ribs from the carcass of a 
canner cow having no more collagen than that from a choice steer. The 
results of their ^'investigation lend no support to the belief that the appear- 
ance, texture, and firmness of beef lean give reliable information concern- 
ing its tenderness." This suggests that other factors than the connective- 
tissue content alone affect the tenderness of meat, for most persons would 
prefer taking a chance on the eye-muscle of ribs from a choice steer being 
more tender than that from a canner cow. 

Pork contains little connective tissue. Mitchell et al. have found that all 
the different cuts of pork contained more nearly the same percentage of 
connective tissue than the different cuts of veal or beef.

206 MEAT 

Connective tissue in fish. The connective tissue of fish is small in 
amount and probably contains mostly collagen with little or no elastin, for 
it is very easily disintegrated and easily dissolved by cooking, leaving the 
muscle fibers separated. 

The Muscle Fibers 

Each fiber is elongated, cylindrical, and multi-nucleated. Howell states 
its length does not exceed 36 mm. but the species is not stated. The average 
length varies in different muscles in the same animal and in the same 
muscles in different kinds of animals. Hammond says that the average 
length of goat fibers is said to be greater than those of beef, and those of 
beef greater than fibers in mutton. The average diameter also varies in 
different muscles, in different species, and in the same animal with age. 
Hammond found the average diameter of a particular muscle of Suffolk 
ram at birth, at 5 months, and at 4 years to be 12.8^, 40.3^, and 54.1/x, 
respectively. It is commonly accepted that the number of fibers does not 
increase after birth so that, in spite of increase in diameter with age, the 
size of the muscle is largely determined by the number and length of the 
fibers rather than their thickness. 

Each fiber is enclosed in the sarcolemma, a thin, elastic membrane. A 
thin, delicate band occurring regularly along the length of the fiber divides 
the fiber into its structural units, the sarcomeres, a fiber being composed 
of a succession of sarcomeres. A dark band shows in the middle of each 
sarcomere, a lighter band on either side. The material between the fibrils is 
known as the sarcoplasm and the relative amount of sarcoplasm varies in 
muscles of different animals. 

The contracting tissue, the fibrils, run the length of the fiber. The fibrils 
consist of alternating light and dark segments which form the cross 
striations of the fibers. See Figs. 21 and 22. The cross bands are supposed 
to be of denser structure than the material between these bands. Fig. 22 
shows the immense number of these cross striations. The cross striations 
also show plainly in the fibers of Fig. 21. 

All the material within the sarcolemma is known as the muscle plasma 
and in the living muscle is in a semi-liquid state. 

Effect of exercise and maturity upon fibers. Beard in his study of ''Tough 
and Tender Meat" states that ''muscle fibers attain their maturity by use 
and age. Development implies increase in size rather than maturity." Beard 
made a microscopic study of different muscles of five different animals. The 
animals selected for study were a heifer, a short-fed steer, a prime steer, an 
-old cow, and a veal calf. Some of his observations and conclusions are as 
follows : 

"Connective tissue seems more apparent in thinner fleshed beef. 

"There was intracellular fat (fatty degeneration) in the fat steer. 



THE MUSCLE FIBERS 



207 



"The fat steer had more intrafascicular, intercellular fat than any 
animals studied. 

"The inherent properties of the endomysium contribute to the toughness 
of meat more than does the size of the fiber. 

"The muscle fibers from the region of the toughest meat contain the 
densest sarcoplasm, while fibers from the tenderest muscles contain the 
lightest sarcoplasm. 

"Intramuscular and particularly intrafascicular fat lessens the toughness 
of meat.

Magnification approximately x 1400. 

"Where only a small amount of intramuscular fat is found it is almost 
always interfascicular. As the interfascicular fat increases in amount 
intrafascicular fat appears which is first intercellular and in case of exces- 
sive adiposity intracellular also." 

Beard states that "while those muscles which are brought most into 
activity and those performing the greatest amount of work may not possess 
a larger fiber than those muscles which are less active, the more active 
muscles do have a thicker perimysium and apparently more substance in 
the fiber, as manifested in the staining characters of the sections." 

Toughness of meat. Since meat is composed of muscle fibers and con- 
nective tissue, toughness of meat must be due to either of these, or to both. 
Toughness of connective tissue depends upon the proportion of elastin 
and collagen; upon the thickness or density of the tissue, which is brought 



208 



MEAT 



about by use and activity; and possibly upon age, for it is common knowl- 
edge that meat from old animals and fowls, whether domestic or wild, 
is tougher than that from young animals. Toughness of the muscle fiber 
depends upon the development and the density of the fiber due to activity, 
and possibly to changes brought about by age. 

The deposition of fat, either intramuscularly, intrafascicularly, or 
intracelluiarly, tends to lessen the toughness. This is shown by the results 
of mechanical tests with the dynamometer, which are given in Table 27. 
The muscle used for thsse tests was the "eye" of beef or the longissimus 
dorsi. The judges, as shown by scores, agreed with the mechanical tests, the 
roasts from the fattened animals being judged more tender than the roasts 
from the lean animals. The possibility of toughness due to power to bind 
water, v/hich may be influenced by the reaction and salt content of the 
fibers, thereby affecting the turgidity of the fibers, and the possibility of 
toughening the fibers by heat coagulation are still to be considered.

Constituents o£ the Muscle Fibers 



The muscle fibers contain several constituents, and these are grouped 
as follows by Howell :"( 1 ) Inorganic salts. (2) Ferments. (3) Pigments. 
(4) Non-nitrogenous extractives (lactic acid, etc.). (5) Nitrogenous 



PIGMENTS AND HEMOGLOBIN 209 

extractives (creatine, urea, etc.). (6) Carbohydrates and fats. (7) 
Proteins." 

Inorganic salts. In meat cookery the inorganic salt most noticeable 
from the standpoint of flavor is sodium chloride or common salt. The 
juice from meat that has had no salt added before or during cooking 
tastes salty. This is due to the sodium chloride of the body fluids, which 
contain about 0.85 per cent. Care should be taken in adding salt to meat, 
or the salt added in cooking plus that of the juices will result in an excess 
of salt in the drippings and in gravy made from them. The muscle fibers do 
not taste as salty as the juices, particularly if a large portion of the fluid 
has been lost in cooking. The tissues do not contain as high a percentage 
of sodium chloride as the fluids of the body. 

The inorganic salts are found in a complex salt equilibrium in meat. 

The ferments. Several different kinds of enzymes are found in muscle 
tissue. The proteolytic, amylolytic, and lipolytic enzymes act on proteins, 
carbohydrates, and fats, respectively. 

Pigments and hemoglobin. When animals are slaughtered for food 
the blood is drained from the body. However, some blood clings to walls 
of the capillaries in the tissues. This blood together with the muscle pig- 
ments gives to meat its pink or red color. 

The hemoglobin of the red corpuscles is the pigment giving blood its 
purplish-red color. The combination of hemoglobin with oxygen forms 
oxyhemoglobin, which is a bright scarlet. Meat is a darker bluish-red when 
first cut, but if the cut surface remains exposed to the air it becomes a 
brighter red color. When hemoglobin and oxyhemoglobin are acted upon 
by enzymes, acids, alkalies, or heat, various decomposition products are 
formed. Hematin is one of the decomposition products formed by heat. 
The coagulating temperature of oxyhemoglobin is around 64°C. Thus 
when meat is cooked to temperatures higher than this the production of 
hematin brings about the brown or gray color of well-done meats. Dilute 
acids or alkalies may also produce hematin from hemoglobin. 

Muscle pigments. The red pigments of muscles resemble the hemoglobin 
of the blood. These pigments are sometimes designated as chromatin sub- 
stances. Whipple and Robscheit-Robbins call them muscle hemoglobin, and 
they have reported that the properties of the muscle hemoglobin are prac- 
tically the same as or identical with those of blood hemoglobin. Whipple 
has found the content of muscle hemoglobin higher in active hunting dogs 
than in inactive house dogs. He states that under different conditions the 
muscles may contain from 10 to 80 grams of muscle hemoglobin for each 
100 grams of blood hemoglobin. 

Skeletal muscles vary in color in the same animal and in different species. 
Sometimes the pigmentation varies in the same species but with different 
types or breeds. Dairy cattle have darker-colored muscles than the beef 
types. The color of the muscle of the young animal is often lighter than 
that of the same muscle from an older animal. Veal is lighter in color 



210 MEAT 

than beef, and the leg muscles of broilers are lighter than those of mature 
fowls. Different muscles of the rabbit vary in color from a very light pink 
to a deep red. The different muscles of pork also vary in color. In general 
the muscles of the lower animals are not pigmented, with the exception 
of the heart muscle. The muscles of fish are white or light in color, but 
the muscles of nearly all mammals are red. Needham states that "red pig- 
mentation seems to occur in muscles from which the most persistent and 
prolonged activity is required." Earlier investigators have also suggested 
that in general pigmentation occurs in muscles used most frequently. 

Ejfect of ripening upon meat pigments. Meat that has been ripened 40 
to 60 days is usually a deeper gray in color, when cooked, than unripened 
meat from the same animal, provided the cooking conditions are the same. 
The darker color may be due to the action of enzymes and acid upon the 
hemoglobin, so that more hemoglobin is broken down to produce hematin 
at lower cooking temperatures, or it may be due to other factors. 

Non-nitrogenous extractives. Lactic acid is always present in muscle 
tissue. The amount is small while the muscle is at rest and increases during 
and after exercise. After death the percentage of lactic acid in the muscle 
increases. 

Nitrogenous extractives. Muscle tissue contains end products of 
protein metabolism. These are removed as they accumulate during life 
from the tissues by the body fluids and are excreted through the kidneys. 
Creatine and creatinine are found in the muscles and to a lesser extent 
in the blood. Uric acid and other nitrogenous extractives are also found in 
the muscles. They are of interest in meat cookery, because they are the 
source of part of the distinctive flavor of meat, and stimulate the flow of 
gastric juice. 

Carbohydrates and fats. The carbohydrate found in the muscle tissue 
is glycogen. 

Burns states "the fat content of the cell is unique. Every cell has a 
fairly constant content of lipide, although when stained by the usual 
methods to demonstrate fat, no evidence is given of such a content. This 
masked fat is only made visible when the cell is diseased or disintegrated." 

The proteins of the muscle fibers. The proteins of the muscles are 
composed largely of two types : ( 1 ) the structural proteins, which consist 
largely of collagen awd elastin and (2) the protoplasmic proteins, variously 
called myosinogen, myogen, myosin, and myoglobulin. The two types of 
proteins behave differently when heated, the effect of heat on the structural 
or connective tissue proteins having been considered. The proteins of the 
plasma are soluble in certain concentrations of salt solutions, such as 
sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, ammonium sulfate, 
sodium phosphate, and other salts. Hence, they are often referred to as 
the soluble proteins. 

The entity of the meat proteins is in the same status as that of flour 



POST-MORTEM CHANGES IN MEAT 211 

and other food proteins. (See proteins of flour, Chapter XL) They may 
or may not be a mixture of proteins having similar properties. 

The soluble muscle proteins are most commonly designated as myosin 
and myogen. They are classified as globulins, the myosin being completely 
precipitated and the myogen partially precipitated by saturated magnesium 
sulfate. However, complete information about these proteins is lacking. 
Moran quotes Muralt as suggesting that the fibrils are composed of a 
firmer material (myosin) surrounded by the more liquid or gel-like 
myogen (sarcoplasm). The evidence for this w^as based on X-ray studies, 
but is not generally accepted. Since myogen is doubly refractive, this is 
almost conclusive proof that it occupies the light bands in the muscle fibers. 

Characteristics of proteins. One of the outstanding characteristics is 
the extent to which solubility is affected by small changes in salt concen- 
trations. Smith has reported that exhaustive extraction with any given 
salt yields only a fraction of the total protein. The highest yield, about 
90 per cent, was obtained with 1.87 M NH4CI, followed by 1.65 M 
LiCl, and a still lower percentage with the other salts tried. Howe found 
that the total globulins (myosin and myogen) compose about one-third of 
the total protein of the muscle, and that the insoluble protein composes 
approximately one-half of the total protein of the muscles of the cow, 
calf, and rabbit. In addition to variation with concentration, with the 
number of extractions, and with different salts, the solubility varies with 
pH. In general the proteins are less soluble at the isoelectric point. 

The plasma proteins undergo denaturation by heat, acids, and surface 
orientation. That the lactate ion affects the extent of denaturation and 
the resulting density of myosin and albumen has been mentioned in 
Chapter I. Still greater changes are brought about by heat when the meat 
is cooked. In meat not only myosin and myogen may be found, but also 
denatured myosin and denatured myogen. In cooked meats these proteins 
may be entirely denatured. 

Isoelectric point of muscle proteins. Smith gives the isoelectric point 
of myosin as pH 5.0-5.3 and that of myogen as pH 6.3. Burns has given the 
isoelectric point of myosin at pH 3.9 and that for the myoproteins at pH 
4.5 and 5. 

Post-Mortem Changes in Meat 

Immediately after slaughter, changes occur in the muscle of an animal. 
These changes, like the changes in milk and eggs, can be retarded by 
method of handling and storage. They are brought about by enzymes and 
microorganisms, and by chemical and physical means which alter the struc- 
ture and chemical composition of the meat. 

Muscle in the living animal is (1) pliant, soft, gel-like, yet somewhat 
viscous. After slaughter the muscles pass from this state into a stiff or 
rigid one (2) known as rigor mortis, or muscle rigor. After some time 



212 MEAT 

the muscles again become pliant. This stage (3) is known as the passing 
of rigor. With longer storage enzymes and chemical means bring about 
(4) more extensive changes which produce ripened meat. With bacterial 
action and still more extensive changes (5) incipient putrefaction occurs. 
The passage from one stage to another is gradual with no definite dividing 
zone and is accelerated at higher temperatures and retarded at lower ones. 

Meat may be cooked during any of these stages and heat denaturation 
causes characteristic changes which are part of the post-mortem changes. 
Means of retarding these changes will be considered before these changes 
are discussed. 

Meat cooked before the onset of rigor is said to be tender. But rigor 
develops quickly so that this period is short. Concerning the question of 
tenderness of meat before the onset of rigor, Dr. Trowbridge, who has 
had many years of experience in meat work, wrote the author, **I doubt if 
freshly killed meat is ever as tender as the same meat ripened." 

Preservation of meat. Freezing. Meat may be frozen and then 
stored at temperatures of —10° to — 15°F. In this way the post-mortem 
changes are nearly inhibited. 

Curing. Common salt is the basis of all cures or pickles. Although many 
modifications are used, the methods may be divided into two classes, brine 
and dry-salt cures. Salt not only preserves but tends to dry the meat. Sugar 
may be added for flavor. Sugar also tends to keep the muscles softer than 
when salt is used alcne and thus tends to increase the tenderness. When 
sugar is added to the brine, the process is known as ''sugar cure" or "sweet 
pickle." Saltpeter (potassium nitrate) or Chili saltpeter (sodium nitrate) 
or the nitrite salts of potassium and sodium may be used in cured meat. 
The red color of cured meat is due to the action of nitrite on the hemo- 
globin of the muscle. If only nitrate salts are used in the brine, they are 
reduced to nitrite by bacterial action. 

Cured meat may be smoked and partially dried on the surface. Actual 
smoke and not chemical treatment to produce a smoke flavor must be used 
in establishments under federal inspection. 

Ham, bacon, and salt pork are probably the best known of cured pork 
products. The loins when cured are often known as Canadian bacon. 

Dried or chipped beef and corned beef are among the more familiar 
cured-beef products. Beef cured in a brine is known as corned beef. Beef 
cuts most often cured are the plates, flanks, and rumps, though from the 
lower grades the chucks and rounds are often used. Dried beef is cured in 
a sweet pickle, then dried and smoked. Usually the rounds and sometimes 
the shoulder clods are used for dried beef. 

Cold storage. The passing of rigor, ripening, and development of 
putrefaction are delayed by quickly chilling the dressed meat and keeping 
it at a low temperature just above the freezing point of meat. Moran states 
that if the dressed meat is chilled slowly more protein is denatured than if 
it is chilled quickly, and, because bacteria attack denaturated protein more 



STORAGE OF MEAT IN THE HOME 213 

rapidly than native protein, quick chilling is one means of increasing the 
storage life of meat. 

Chemically conditioned cold. Moran states that with temperature con- 
trol alone the storage life of chilled beef is about 35 to 40 days. If, in 
addition to low temperature control, what is sometimes known as ^'chem- 
ically conditioned cold," i.e., 10 per cent of carbon dioxide, is used in the 
storage atmosphere, the storage life of the meat may be extended to 60 or 70 
days. The carbon dioxide retards or checks bacterial growth but if too 
much is used with red meats such as beef and mutton, the surface of the 
meat turns dark. This is because of the decreased amount of oxygen ob- 
tained by the meat when carbon dioxide is increased. For fish a higher 
percentage of carbon dioxide can be used. Stansby and Griffith have re- 
ported that haddock packed in ice and plus an atmosphere of 15 to 40 per 
cent of carbon dioxide have their storage life doubled over that when 
packed in ice alone. 

Contamination with bacteria and storage life. Another factor affecting 
the storage life of meat is the initial contamination with bacteria. But with 
care the initial contamination should be small. Other things being equal, 
the smaller the initial load of bacteria the longer the storage life of the 
meat. Spoilage by bacteria, yeasts, and molds is largely surface, and in 
general does not extend to a greater depth than ^ to ^ inch. Hoagland, 
McBryde, and Powick in their investigations of changes in beef during 
cold storage above freezing found that "bacteria and molds grow on the 
surface of cold storage carcasses but do not penetrate to any great depth 
(less than 1 inch in 177 da3^s)." 

Microorganisms may enter the meat by penetration from the surface, 
which is a slow process, and by following the cavities in meat, that is, the 
blood and lymph vessels. 

Empey found that bacteria grow and develop very slowly on meat during 
rigor, as a /»H of approximately 5.3 to 5.6 is not a desirable one for their 
growth. Stansby and Griffith also found that bacteria do not develop rapidly 
on fish during rigor. 

Humidity. Mueller and Richardson have reported that dry air as well 
as the low temperature is a factor in preventing bacterial growth. Hoag- 
land, McBryde, and Powick found that in a cooler with low humidity the 
growth of mold on the surface of the meat at 177 days was no greater than 
in a cooler with higher humidity at 53 days. 

Storage of meat in the home. Proper storage of meat in the home 
is often a problem. Halves and quarters of dressed animals have a natural 
protective skin covering. But when wholesale cuts are divided into smaller 
parts, the surface area for contamination and the contamination both in- 
crease from these cut surfaces coming in contact with meat blocks, hands, 
wrapping paper, and kitchen and refrigerator utensils. In general, unless 
frozen, meat should not be stored long in the home. Low temperatures and 



214 MEAT 

dry circulating air increase the storage life of meat. Burnett found roasts 
keep best, steaks and chops next, and ground meat most poorly. 

Rigor. During rigor meat is less tender than after the passage of rigor, 
so that rigor is of interest in meat cookery. 

Cause. The exact cause for the development of rigor is not known. 
Hardy has suggested that two reversible reactions occurring in living 
muscle, namely, glycogen ^ lactic acid and phosphagen ^ phosphoric acid 
and creatine, are no longer reversible and after death proceed in one direc- 
tion with the accumulation of lactic acid and creatine in the tissues. 

Lactic acid has some role in the development of rigor, as rigor is usually 
accompanied by or preceded by increase in lactic acid. But, Moran states, 
under certain conditions, i.e., if an animal has been treated with insulin or 
iodoacetic, rigor develops without the production of lactic acid. He also 
adds that there are a number of chemical reactions which take place at 
death that have not been defined and among them will be found the cause 
or stimulus leading to the changes in the state of the proteins. 

Time of onset of rigor. At ordinary temperatures rigor is usually com- 
plete in 10 to 12 hours. Rigor is supposed to develop more slowly at lower 
and more rapidly at higher temperatures. But Smith found the effect of 
temperature on the rate of onset of rigor to be variable. 

Only skeletal muscles develop rigor. The proportion of soluble protein 
is sometimes given as an explanation of why some muscles develop a greater 
degree of rigor than others. Skeletal muscles contain a higher percentage of 
soluble proteins than smooth muscles. The carcass of the pig generally does 
not develop rigor, but occasionally one does. It is therefore interesting 
to surmise whether this is due to a small proportion of soluble protein or 
to other causes. 

H there is more lactic acid than usual in the muscle of the animal when 
killed, as happens when an animal is hunted or a chicken is chased before 
killing, rigor sets in more quickly. Benson has reported that rigor sets in 
more rapidly in fatigued fish muscle (trawl-caught) than in the muscle of 
fish taken from a pen. 

Changes occurring during rigor. In addition to the development of 
turgidity, other changes occur simultaneously, for enzyme action does not 
cease at the time of slaughter. There is evolution of heat known as the 
heat of rigor. The glycogen practically disappears from the tissues and 
this glycogen loss parallels the lactic acid increase. Moran states that for 
mammalian muscle the lactic acid reaches a value of approximately 0.8 per 
cent. The pH of the muscle falls from pH 7.2 or 7.4 to about pK 5.6 or 
5.8, sometimes as low as />H 5.3. Because of various factors, such as 
amount of glycogen to form lactic acid, the p\l reached during rigor varies 
somewhat. 

It had previously been found without exception that the amount of 
soluble protein is decreased during rigor; but Smith found no change in 
solubility of the proteins in his investigation. 



RIPENED MEAT 215 

Passing of rigor from muscles. After a lapse of time rigor passes off. 
The length of time varies with the speed with which rigor developed, with 
different conditions and temperatures of storage, and with different animals. 
It may require 5 to 6 days or longer at refrigeration temperature and a 
shorter period at higher temperatures. It passes more rapidly from a carcass 
in which rigor develops early. With the passing of rigor the muscles be- 
come more soft and flexible. One observation that the author's family often 
made was that chickens killed and stored before cooking over night in the 
cellar were more tender than chickens cooked and eaten the same day they 
were killed. The temperature of the cellar was higher than that of a 
refrigerator, and the chickens were often chased before killing; these fac- 
tors probably affected the time required for the passing of rigor. 

The greatest physical change with passing of rigor is the increasing 
tenderness of the meat. 

Ripened meat. Noticeable changes that characterize ripened meat, 
meat from w^hich rigor has passed and which has stood some time, are 
increased tenderness, change in flavor, and increased ease with which juice 
may be pressed from the meat. The last is probably related to the increased 
juiciness of the cooked, ripened meat. 

Emmett and Grindley have reviewed the literature on changes in meat 
during storage. The report of the work of Grassman is from their summary. 

In experiments reported by Hoagland et a!., for beef stored just above 
the freezing point of the meat from 17 to 177 days, it is interesting to note 
that all judges agreed that the flavor and tenderness of the meat are im- 
proved with 15 to 30 days of storage. With storage for 45 days and longer, 
they speak of an "old," "gamey," and "off" flavor. From the comments 
one is led to believe that they like the meat stored for 56 days better than 
that stored for 45 days. This was probably due to differences in the char- 
acter of the quarters of beef from different animals. With longer storage 
the flavor was not palatable, "old" and "off" being used to describe the 
flavor developed. 

Grassman has reported ripened meat as being more juicy, of better flavor, 
and more tender than unripened meat. He adds that ripening meat to the 
extent preferred by the English for roasting is not good for boiling, as it 
imparts a disagreeable flavor to the broth. 

Whether one prefers the flavor of ripened meat or that of fresh meat 
is largely a matter of personal choice. It is hard to describe the flavor of 
ripened meat, probably because there are no descriptive terms which convey 
the same meaning to different people. Ripened meat is more acid, is richer 
in flavor, and has more of a high or game flavor. Ripening may also 
improve the flavor of the fat of the beef. The fat from some animals 
develops a better flavor with ripening than that of other animals. When 
it is improved, the flavor of the fat is more agreeable and more mellow. 
However, the kind of feed the animal has received, as well as the age, sex. 



216 MEAT 

breed of animal, and the amount of fat may influence the flavor of the 
meat and the fat. 

Length of time required for ripening. The length of time required for 
ripening varies according to the degree of ripened flavor desired, and the 
temperature at which the meat is stored. As the temperature is elevated the 
time for ripening is shortened. At temperatures a little above the freezing 
point of meat, 20 to 40 days seems to give the optimum flavor. Longer 
than 40 days gives too high a flavor for most persons. Helser says, "When 
ripened meat is properly trimmed and prepared there will be no mold flavor 
at all, but you will have a rich, juicy, tender, and w^ell-flavored piece of 
meat. One trial will convince anyone." 

Finished carcasses are best for ripening. Helser states that well-finished 
carcasses are best suited for ripening purposes. Meat from carcasses of 
animals that contain little fat "will get sticky, mold, and will have to be 
trimmed heavily to avoid the moldy flavor." The layer of fat on the outside 
of the prime beef and the greater quantity of fat in the muscle fibers pre- 
vent the putrefactive bacteria from developing. Ripened meat develops a 
growth of mold on the surface of the meat that must be removed before 
cooking. Helser states: "The degree of ripeness is judged largely by the 
length of the 'whiskers,' as the mold is sometimes called." 

Changes in cooked beef due to ripening. Helser, Nelson, and Lowe have 
found that roasts from the same animal, refrigerated under the same con- 
ditions, show several distinct changes in cooking from that of fresh beef. 
All the roasts were cooked at the same oven temperature and to the same 
interior temperature. Roasts cooked after 10, 20, 40, and 60 days of storage 
show a progressively gray color in the interior of the cooked roasts. Roasts 
cooked to an inner temperature of 57°C. and cooked on the fifth, seventh, 
and tenth days of storage were a bright red color ; w^hereas those ripened 
60 days have only a little red or rose color. Roasts from calves are less red 
and more gray in color than roasts from older animals. 

Roasts from ripened beef brown more readily — and this is true for both 
the fat and lean — than unripened roasts from the same animal, cooked 
under the same conditions. In these experiments the results of scores for 
palatability indicate that "in order to produce beef for roasts having the 
most desirable beef flavor, steers should be at least 20 months old, and 
preferably 30." 

After the passing of rigor the roasts are more tender and become in- 
creasingly tender with length of storage. Although the tenderness of the 
meat increases with storage, the increase after 20 days of storage is prob- 
ably not great enough to pay for the increased cost and trouble of storing. 

With longer storage the roasts are more juicy. Also with ripening the 
quantity of juice collecting in the platter when the roast is carved is de- 
cidedly greater than for roasts cooked after 10 days or less than 10 days 
of storage. 

The flavor of the beef improved with ripening, and the maximum 



CHANGES OCCURRING IN MEAT 217 

development of flavor, under the refrigeration conditions used, came with 
20 to 40 days of storage. For the connoisseur of flavor, this improved flavor 
is decidedly worth the cost of storage. 

Incipient putrefaction. Much discussion has occurred concerning the 
presence of bacteria within muscle. Moran states that in freshly killed 
muscle there is usually a low bacterial count. Hoagland, McBryde, and 
Powick found that certain bacteria may normally be present in some 
carcasses of beef, but they possessed no pathological significance and did 
not multiply in proper cold-storage conditions. At low-storage tempera- 
tures, spoilage by bacteria is most prevalent at the surface of the meat. 
As has been indicated, growth is slow during rigor, for the acidity of the 
meat does not favor the development of microorganisms. But with in- 
creased storage of meat, the acidity of the meat is lessened or the alkalinity 
increases and ammonia is liberated. 

Of the different tests proposed for the detection of incipient putrefaction. 
Baker believes that the determination of ammonical nitrogen has been the 
most useful and the presence of 0.02-0.025 per cent indicates the beginning 
of putrefaction. Thus Baker suggests that, when the pH has risen to />H 
6.2 the meat has undergone deterioration. 

Changes occurring in meat during storage. Changes due to 
enzymes. The lipolytic, amylolytic, and proteolytic enzymes act on fats, 
carbohydrates, and proteins, respectively. During life, these and other 
enzymes are concerned with the metabolic processes of the body. 

Enzyme changes are usually brought about more rapidly with higher 
temperatures. At very low temperatures the action may be very slow and 
different from that at higher temperatures owing to differenes in activity 
of different enzymes at different temperatures. Hoagland, McBryde, and 
Powick have reported that the external fat and kidney fat in beef stored 
just above the freezing point of the meat showed increased fatty acid con- 
tent and a corresponding deterioration of these fats. They found less 
change in the intramuscular fat, as it was protected from bacterial action, 
and changes in it were due to lipase enzymes. Oxidative changes in fats 
are of course greater in the surface fat. The surface fat in ripened meat 
often shows greater changes in flavor than interior fat. 

Amylolytic enzymes bring about the change of glycogen to lactic acid. 
These changes occur rather early in storage. 

Proteolytic enzymes bring about changes of the proteins to amino acids, 
thus increasing the amino nitrogen, or the non-protein nitrogen, or the 
soluble nitrogen products of the meat. Hoagland, McBryde, and Powick 
found that, in quarters of beef stored 14 to 177 days, the increase in amino 
nitrogen amounted to 3 to 7 per cent of the total nitrogen of the beef. 

Autolytic changes in beef at 31°. C. Hoagland, McBryde, and Powick 
stored pieces of beef free from bacteria in sterile containers at a tempera- 
ture of 37 °C. for periods of 7 to 100 days. Considerable juice exuded from 
the pieces of meat, which turned brown in color. The beef was also brown 



218 MEAT 

on the surface for about % inch in depth, except where it touched the 
container, and this was bright pink in color. Hoagland has reported that 
this deep pink to a purplish-red color is due to hematoporphyrin. Its forma- 
tion is attributed to enzymes. The meat retained its original form; the 
sample stored 100 days was somewhat more tender than the one stored 
7 days. The changes in the meat that could be detected by the senses of 
sight, smell, and taste they called organoleptic changes. The odor changed 
with increasing age. This change they describe as "rather old but not 
unpleasant." The broiled 103-day sample of meat "is quite tender and has 
an old, highly acid, and rather disagreeable flavor, which persists in the 
mouth after eating; the meat is not entirely objectionable but is not 
appetizing." In ordinary storage conditions meat cannot be kept free from 
bacteria and is not stored at such a high temperature. 

Chemical changes. In storage of meat the changes due to different 
factors such as bacteria, enzymes, etc., are brought about simultaneously. 
The chemical changes are the changes in the percentage of the different 
constituents of the meat, however these may be brought about. Stored meat 
usually loses weight by reason of moisture loss. The acidity increases. 
Emmett and Grindley found that beef refrigerated 22 days compared 
with meat from the same animal refrigerated 2 days at 33° to 35°F., "(1) 
had lost no water, (2) that the percentage of water soluble solids, the 
soluble, insoluble and total protein, the non-coagulable protein, the nitrog- 
enous and total organic extractives, the forms of ash, the total nitrogen 
and the total phosphorus all remained practically unchanged. (3) That 
the only consistent real changes were a distinct increase in the total soluble 
and the soluble inorganic phosphorus, being 8.0 and 17.9 per cent respec- 
tively, and a decrease of 8.3 per cent in the non-nitrogenous organic 
extractives. (4) The nutritive value of the meat was unaltered." After 
refrigeration for 43 days the chemical changes in the meat were greater 
in number than those for the 22-day sample. When allowance was made 
for the moisture loss they found a definite increase in the soluble dry 
substance, the nitrogenous, non-nitrogenous, and total organic extractives, 
the total soluble nitrogen, and the soluble inorganic phosphorus. There was 
a slight increase in the soluble coagulable and total soluble protein nitrogen 
and in the insoluble and total nitrogen. 

They found the cooked meats from the 43-day refrigerated sample higher 
in water content, therefore juicier, than the 6-day refrigerated sample. 
From comparisons of other losses that occurred in the cooked 43-day 
sample they concluded that it was as nutritious as that from the cooked 
6-day refrigerated meat. 

Changes in Cooked Meat and the Cooking of Meat 

Meat is cooked to sterilize it and for most persons to make it more 
palatable. It should be cooked in such a way as to increase its tenderness 



JUICINESS 219 

if it is a tough cut, and to keep it tender if it is a tender cut. It is desirable 
in cooking meat to have maximum tenderness of both fibers and connective 
tissue, so that the meat carves well and cuts easily. Meat cooked so long, 
or at such a high temperature that the connective tissue is dissolved, is not 
attractive and the fibers are tough and stringy. As a general rule, it should 
be cooked in such a way as to retain its nutritive value, i.e., to prevent 
cooking losses to as great an extent as possible, either dripping losses or 
destruction of some food constituents by heat. When the drippings are 
used in gravy or other ways this loss is not a serious one. 

The flavor and the tenderness of the cooked meat depend to a great 
degree upon the quality of the meat before cooking, for cooking cannot 
make a well-flavored piece of meat from one of poor quality and flavor, 
nor does it always produce a tender piece of meat. However, the method 
and length of time of cooking may and often do spoil a good piece of meat, 
yet the method of cooking may improve a poor piece of meat. 

Browning and thoroughly cooking meat develop a different flavor, just 
as cooking cabbage a long time develops a characteristic flavor. Many per- 
sons prefer the development of this flavor. 

Coagulation of proteins. The heat renders the soluble proteins of 
meat insoluble, the extent of denaturation depending on the stage of 
cookery or temperature reached, the time held at this temperature, the />H 
of the meat, its salt content, its degree of ripeness, and probably other 
factors. The higher the temperature reached and the longer the meat is 
held at this temperature, the greater the denaturation. The relation of />H 
to denaturation has been considered in Chapter I. With increased denatura- 
tion the meat becomes firmer and denser, with shrinkage in volume. 

Formation o£ gelatin. After the meat is heated in a moist atmosphere 
to a definite temperature for a sufficient time the connective tissue dissolves. 
If the concentration of gelatin in the liquid reaches 1.5 or higher percent- 
ages, it forms a jelly when cooled. Connective tissue is composed largely of 
collagen. Collagen is changed to gelatin more rapidly at higher tempera- 
tures. Smith states that the phosphate ion accelerates the rate at which 
collagen is changed to gelatin at a given temperature. The addition of acid 
to meat may also increase the rate of hydrolysis of collagen. 

Juiciness. Juiciness is given as a desirable quality of cooked meat. Meat 
loses moisture during cooking, even when cooked submerged in water. The 
higher the interior temperature to which the meat is cooked, if the composi- 
tion and cooking conditions are standardized, the less moist the meat. Meat 
that contains a large amount of fat within and around the muscle fibers 
may seem juicy because of melting of the fat by heat in cooking. The fibers 
with a high fat content may also have a high water content, particularly 
if part of the fat is in an emulsion that will not break with high tempera- 
tures, thus retaining part of the moisture. 

Some pieces of meat are apparently far more juicy than others after 



220 MEAT 

cooking. It seems rather certain from the results of Hoagland et al., Grass- 
man, and others, that the increase of amino nitrogen with aging is one 
factor in bringing this about. The amino acids may not be able to bind as 
much water as the protein, so that the free water content and apparent 
juiciness may be increased with increase of amino nitrogen. Sometimes the 
juiciness seems to be related to the fat content. How great an influence 
the method of distribution of the fat within the fiber, the salt content of 
the fiber, the pH, or the development and maturity of the fiber have upon 
this point cannot be stated. The tissues of old animals lose their power to 
bind as much w^ater as tissues from younger animals. Although this may 
partially explain the better quality of meat from younger animals it does 
not explain why veal is less juicy than baby beeves. Perhaps, if the water 
is bound too tightly by the coagulable protein micelles, the dryness is more 
apparent to the tactile sense. 

Child and Fogarty found that approximately 1 1 per cent more fluid 
could be pressed from one semitendinosus muscle when heated to an in- 
terior temperature of 58°C. than for the other semitendinosus muscle from 
the same animal heated to 75°C. 

Noble, Halliday, and Klaas found : "When subjected to a pressure of 
3,800 pounds per square inch, the ribs cooked to 61 °C. yielded more juice 
than those heated to 75 °C. and the round more than the corresponding 
ribs. The larger quantity of juice was found to be richer in solids, total 
nitrogen, and, in one case, also richer in coagulable nitrogen." 

Empey states that for uncooked meat there is a direct relationship be- 
tween the hydrogen-ion concentration of the muscle fiber and its capacity 
for holding muscle fluid, but the author knows of no work in which 
juiciness of cooked meat has been related to /)H. 

Change in color. During the heating of meat, after a temperature of 
about 50°C. is reached, the color gradually changes from red or pink to a 
lighter shade and finally, if a sufficiently high temperature is reached, be- 
comes brown or gray. Veal and pork are more gray, beef and lamb develop 
a browner shade. This color change has been discussed in connection with 
meat pigments, the oxyhemoglobin being broken down by heat to the brown 
hematin. The degree of ripeness of the meat affects the temperature at 
which the color change occurs, ripened meat becoming gray at a lower 
temperature. 

The extreme browning on the surface of meat is accompanied by break- 
down of surface proteins and fat, probably with liberation of sulfur and 
other compounds. 

Tenderness. Methods of estimating. Tenderness is one quality uni- 
versally desired in cooked meats. Tenderness may be estimated by subjective 
methods such as the ease of cutting or chewing. At present the most widely 
used method for comparing the tenderness of meat is the grading chart. 
The chart developed by the Cooking Committee of the National Project, 



TENDERNESS 



221 



"Cooperative Meat Investigations," uses seven numbers and terms to 
designate the tenderness of the sample. They are: very tender, tender, 
moderately tender, slightly tough, tough, very tough, and extremely tough. 
Each judge forms his own standards from the basis of his experience. If the 
judge has had a complete range of qualities on which to base his standards 
and is consistent in adhering to them, he may become very proficient in 
judging comparative tenderness. 

Numerous mechanical devices have been devised for estimating the ten- 
derness of meat. The ones most commonly used at present are : ( 1 ) the 
shearing apparatus, which registers the number of pounds required to shear 
a piece of meat of a given diameter; (2) the penetrometer, with which a 
specially constructed needle may be used; and (3) a puncturing gage. 

Results of tenderness tests. There has been considerable discussion as to 
whether raw meat is tenderer or tougher than the same meat when cooked, 
which to date has not been settled. Moran and Smith, after studying the 
effect of ripening on tenderness of beef, say: "It is a matter of general 
experience amongst those accustomed to raw meat that cooked meat is 
tougher than raw meat." They also quote Stefansson from "The Friendly 
Arctic" as follows: "Cooking increases the toughness and brings out the 
stringiness. I have never eaten any raw meat that was noticeably tough or 
stringy." 

Black, Warner, and Wilson have reported that cooked samples were 
more tender than raw samples from good and medium-grade three-year- 
old grass-fed steers and steers fed both grain and grass. The number of 
steers in each lot was eight, the number of tests for raw and cooked meat 
was 12 and 4, respectively. Their results are given in Table 28.

Noble, Halliday, and Klaas found beef more tender, as tested by a 
penetrometer, when heated to 61 °C. than to 75 °C. 



222 MEAT 

Lowe compared the penetrometer and shearing apparatus by using both 
tests to measure the tenderness of the longissimus dorsi of raw and cooked 
beef rib roasts. The roasts were used in pairs, one roast being cooked, the 
other left raw. Both methods indicated raw meat to be the tenderest, the 
rare intermediate, and the well-done the least tender. But penetration 
tests appear to be influenced by the density of the meat, the meat with 
the greatest cooking losses, i.e., the well-done, being firmest. Thus penetra- 
tion tests indicated no difference in meat from different animals when 
there was little difference in firmness but where both the shearing tests and 
grading score indicated a range in tenderness. The penetration depth was 
greater in soft raw meat than in firm cooked meat, the differences being 
highly significant. Shearing tests showed significant difference in the ten- 
derness of the longissimus dorsi from animals of varying grade and the 
values obtained were In agreement with the grading score. None of the 
correlations between penetration and shearing tests were significant, from 
which it was concluded that shearing was the better method for measuring 
the tenderness of meat. 

Means of increasing tenderness. The possible ways of increasing the 
tenderness of meat may be classed as follows: (1) mechanical, (2) enzyme 
action, and (3) by peptization and increased solubility of the proteins. The 
first Is a physical, the last two would bring about chemical changes. 

Meat is ground to break the fibers and connective tissue, which, because 
it lessens the need for chewing, increases the tenderness. For very tough 
cuts this is probably the most satisfactory procedure. In tests that have been 
made, It was found that meat, ground fine and several times as for 
Swedish Meat Balls, is more juicy and palatable than meat ground medium 
or coarse and only once. 

Investigators have sought for suitable enzymatic and chemical means of 
Increasing tenderness of meat for years. The proteolytic enzymes found in 
the meat increase the tenderness but considerable time at low storage 
temperatures is required. Hence, if a proteolytic enzyme that would speed 
up the breakdown of the proteins and which would give satisfactory results 
were found the tenderness of meat could be increased in a shorter storage 
period. Papain has been tried. The author's results to date with this enzyme 
have not been satisfactory. When it was applied to the surface of the meat 
some time was required for the enzyme to act and then only a thin, 
powdery surface layer vv^as formed. When It was applied just prior to cook- 
ing the heat destroyed the enzyme, so that its application was of little or no 
value. No satisfactory methods of Injecting this enzyme have been reported. 
Investigations that have been reported in connection with flour proteins 
suggest that It Is possible that meat may contain substances that tend to 
inhibit the action of the proteinases of the meat and if some salt that would 
counteract this Inhibition through oxidation or other means could be In- 
jected that the meat would become tender more rapidly. 



TENDERNESS 223 

The changing of collagen of the connective tissues or structural proteins 
to gelatin during cooking is one means of increasing the tenderness of these 
proteins, but the solubility of the protoplasmic proteins decreases when they 
are coagulated by heat. 

Another method of increasing the tenderness of meat would be through 
the use of substances that would peptize both or either the connective or 
protoplasmic meat proteins, thus increasing their solubility and the tender- 
ness of the meat. Means of bringing about peptization have been discussed 
in Chapter I. Sugar peptizes some proteins. Many electrolytes also bring 
about peptization, particularly if mixed Intimately with the substance to be 
peptized. Anions of acids such as tartrate, citrate, and acetate may bring 
about a greater or lesser degree of peptization. A practical peptizer, if such 
could be found and used, would be a salt that could be injected and have 
slight effect at low temperatures but bring about peptization fairly rapidly 
when heated during cooking of the meat. 

Smith states: "It is of Interest to note that, in cases where the primary 
aim of cooking Is to make the meat more tender (as, for Instance, In 
stewing), the required degree of tenderness can be reached more quickly 
by addition of phosphate, or what amounts to the same thing, since the meat 
itself contains phosphate, of concentrated stock from a previous boiling. 
The concentration of phosphate which gives the greatest effect is about 
0.2M, but a quarter of this will have quite an appreciable effect. A suitable 
mixture of mono- and di-hydrogen phosphates to give a pH between 6 and 
7 was employed." 

Meat is sometimes placed in a pickle of equal parts of vinegar and water 
and is used for Sauerbraten or similar dishes. Soaking in the acid is sup- 
posed to Increase the tenderness as well as develop a particular flavor of 
the meat. If the vinegar contains tannins, the meat should not be cooked in 
an iron utensil, for a dark color will develop from the tannins combining 
with the iron. The effect of the acid on the meat, which will probably 
depend upon the amount of acid added and the resulting pH of the meat 
and whether this pH is at, above, or below the isoelectric point of Its 
proteins, may cause the connective tissue to swell and hydrolyze the col- 
lagen to gelatin more rapidly when the meat Is heated. Tomatoes or sour 
cream are also added to Swiss steak and tomatoes to stews. Sometimes the 
acid appears to increase the tenderness; but often a paired cut without the 
acid is as tender or more tender than the one to which acid is added. 

Baker states that the lactic acid developed in the meat may be responsible 
for improvement in tenderness. He says that Walsh investigated the develop- 
ment of acidity in lean beef and claims that its formation is important in 
the preparation of canned meats. Properly matured meat, after canning, 
"melts in the mouth," the muscle fibers are softened, slicabllity is enhanced, 
and the pink color is more vivid. But in maturing or ripening changes are 
also brought about by enzymes and other means. 



224 MEAT 



Cooking o£ Frozen Meat 

Frozen meat and poultry are obtainable in retail markets in larger cities. 
In addition many people freeze meat in mechanical freezer units, and the 
practise of obtaining compartments and freezing fresh meat in local cold 
storage plants in rural and small urban communities is increasing tremen- 
dously. Hence, the cooking of frozen meat attains importance and knowl- 
edge of what happens to the meat during freezing gives understanding of 
why it should be cooked soon after defrosting, if it is defrosted before 
cooking. 

Freezing. When meat is frozen, the unbound water forms ice crystals. 
These crystals on thawing, with their dissolved substances tend to exude 
from the cut surfaces of the meat. Empey found the drip from frozen and 
thawed meat very similar in composition to fluid pressed from unfrozen 
meat. He found a direct relationship between the hydrogen-ion concentra- 
tion and the capacity of the muscle to hold fluid. Minimum drip occurred 
when the pH of the muscles had not dropped below 6.3. However, he did 
no work to determine the tenderness of the meat in connection with pH or 
at what pH it would be most desirable to freeze the meat for quality and 
palatability after cooking. The writer's experience thus far is that meat 
that is not tender before freezing does not improve in tenderness by freezing. 
This would indicate that for palatable meat it is preferable for meat to be 
ripened sufficiently before freezing. 

Meat may be frozen rapidly or slowly. In rapid freezing the meat Is 
subjected to a very low temperature so that freezing occurs In a short time. 
The advantage of this method is supposed to be due to the fact that the ice 
crystals have little time to grow; hence they are smaller and break the 
fibers to a smaller extent. There Is considerable controversy as to which 
is the best procedure. Moran says that In their studies rapid freezing 
possessed no advantages over slow freezing as regarded the quality of the 
product, but that In each case the most important factor affecting the 
quality was the storage temperature. Lowe and Keltner found no difference 
in the quality of poultry frozen by rapid and slow methods. Many reports 
In the literature Indicate that it Is preferable to keep the meat or poultry 
at quite low temperatures, —10° to — 15°F., to prevent desiccation of 
the meat. Tressler believes It Is desirable to have the temperature as uni- 
form as possible, for a fluctuating temperature also increases moisture loss. 
Each piece of meat or bird should be wrapped to prevent moisture loss. 
Tressler says, ''Severe desiccation causes a considerable loss of flavoring 
components, and makes the frozen product tougher, less easily cooked, and 
therefore, less desirable for food." 

Defrosting. The method of defrosting seems to be particularly im- 
portant for poultry. Snyder found poultry defrosted In water markedly less 
desirable In flavor than poultry defrosted in cold air, i.e., in a refrigerator. 



THE USE OF SALT 



225 



The method of defrosting was also more important than drawing and length 
of storage period in determining flavor, although the giblets of undrawn 
birds were not so desirable as those of drawn birds. 

Many questions are received from Iowa women regarding the flavor of 
poultry frozen and stored in local plants. It is a common practise for 
these women to defrost the poultry in water, but their frozen meat is 
defrosted in cold air. 

Beef and meats having extensive cut surfaces of the muscles tend to 
"drip" more than poultry after defrosting. Since loss of this fluid also

interior temperature of the meat. 



results in loss of flavor and nutritive value, it is desirable to cook the meat 
soon after defrosting or even before defrosting. Defrosted meat is also 
more susceptible to bacterial attack. 

Cooking. Defrosted meat is cooked in the same way as unfrozen meat. 
But if cooking is started before the meat is defrosted, then the temperature 
and time of cooking need to be changed to allow the meat both to thaw 
and to cook. Otherwise, a steak or roast can be served with a brown 
appetizing exterior and still be frozen in the interior. The writer prefers 
to start cooking all frozen steaks and chops before defrosting, as there is 
then no loss of fluid and flavor. But the meat is not seared. The cooking 
temperature must be low and the cooking time increased to at least 3 or 4 
times longer than for unfrozen meat. Because of the longer time required 
for thawing and cooking the exterior browns sufficiently without searing. 

The use of salt. There is no advantage in salting large pieces of meat, 



226 MEAT 

as the salt Is placed on the surface of the meat and does not penetrate 
to any appreciable extent during cooking. Part of the salt is carried from 
the surface of the meat by the juices and into the drippings. Snyder 
determined the total and nitrogenous losses in beef roasts and stews. The 
meat was all from the same carcass, the cooking conditions were standard- 
ized, and the roasts or stews cooked in pairs. Similar cuts, cut as nearly 
alike as possible by an experienced meat cutter, from the right and left 
side of the animal, were used for each pair, one of the pair being salted, 
the other left unsalted. The quantity of salt used was about the amount 
that would be used by housewives in cooking meat, 1.5 grams per pound 
of meat. The losses were determined on the basis of the uncooked weight 
of the meat and on surface area, but both methods showed no appreciable 
differences in the total or nitrogenous losses of the salted and unsalted 
meats. In the salted roasts the flavor penetrated to less than ^ inch in 
depth. The layer in which the salt had penetrated was a deeper gray in 
color than the corresponding layer on the unsalted roast. 

Records for cooked meats. In addition to the records of weight, time 
of cooking, etc., a tracing may be made of the cut surface of roasts, steaks, 
and chops. A piece of parchment paper is laid over the cut surface and 
the entire surface rubbed lightly with the fingers to bring it in contact with 
the meat. The fat leaves the paper semi-transparent, and the moisture from 
the lean portion slightly puckers the paper. A pencil tracing is made 
around the edge of the meat and the fat and bone layers. A tracing of this 
sort is better than a photograph in that the dimensions are actual size. It 
also shows the exact distribution of fat, lean, and bone. A good grade of 
thin typewriter paper can be used for making these prints. 

Methods of Cooking Meats 

In general meat Is cooked (1) by dry heat and (2) by moist heat. Dry 
heat Is generally used for tender cuts, such as roasts and steaks. The meat 
is surrounded by dry air In the oven, under the broiler, or over coals, or 
by hot fat. In general, moist heat is used for the less tender cuts and 
Includes methods by which the meat is surrounded by steam or water. This 
Includes cooking meat in water as for stews, In steamers, in casseroles. In 
Dutch ovens, and even in roasting pans when the lid fits tightly and holds 
the steam around the meat. 

The tender cuts. In general these cuts include the prime-rib roasts, 
steaks or roasts from the loin and sirloin, leg of lamb, fresh pork hams, 
and pork, lamb, and veal chops. 

Beef ribs. Prime-beef ribs may be cooked as standing roasts or the bones 
may be removed for rolled roasts. Since the time of cooking varies with 
many factors, It is difficult to state a definite time per pound for cooking 
meat. Table 29 may be used for estimating approximate cooking time of 



THE TENDER CUTS 227 

one-rib and two-rib standing roasts. For three-rib standing roasts cooked 
to an interior temperature of 57 °C. an average time of about 20 to 22 
minutes per pound is required when the experimental searing or 150°C. 
constant temperature methods are used. When the interior of the roast 
reaches 57 °C., the edges of the roast are contracting so that the large 
center muscle of the ribs bulges. As the roast reaches the well-done stage, 
all the muscles are contracted to a greater extent so that the large muscle 
does not bulge as much as when the interior has reached only the rare or 
medium well-done stage. 

A rolled rib roast usually requires longer per pound for cooking than a 
standing rib roast from the same cut. The rolled roast is usually more 
compact in shape with a proportionally longer diameter, so that the distance 
to the center is greater. See Fig. 25. 

Lamb roasts. A leg of lamb is placed on a rack in an open pan, skin or 
fell side up; but the fell is placed down for a shoulder r6ast. The fell 
can be removed, but Alexander found that its removal increases the cook- 
ing losses, increases the cooking time, and does not increase the palatability 
of the meat. 

Alexander and Clark state that approximately 35 minutes per pound 
may be allowed for cooking by the experimental searing or the 150°C. 
constant temperature methods, but considerable variation can be expected. 
They found the cooking time for 750 legs of lamb, roasted by the Coopera- 
tive Meat Investigation searing (experimental) method to an interior 
temperature of 76°C., varied from 25 to 58 minutes per pound, the small 
poorly finished legs from cull carcasses requiring longer and plump well- 
finished legs requiring a shorter time. The time is about the same, or some- 
what shorter, for the 150°C. constant temperature method, and is con- 
siderably shorter if the leg is cooked to an interior temperature of 83 °C. 

Veal. Veal roasts may be cooked in open pans, the time per pound for 
cooking varying widely with the size of the roast. 

Pork. The Cooperative Meat Investigation cooking committee used for 
the searing method 20 minutes at 250° to 255 °C., the remainder of the 
cooking period being at 150°C. For the present constant temperature 
method, 175°C. is used. A higher temperature is used with pork because 
of the long time required on account of the slow rate of heat penetration 
and the higher interior temperature to which pork is cooked, an interior 
temperature of 78°C. to 87°C. being used. The official testing temperature 
is 84°C. 

Steaks. Steaks from 1 to 2 inches in thickness may have a thermometer 
inserted, the right-angle type being easier to turn for reading as the steak 
is turned. An interior temperature of 60° to 63°C., when removed from 
the oven, gives a medium well-done steak. Steaks may be broiled below a gas 
flame, under an electric heating unit, or over coals, or they may be pan 
broiled. In broiling, the steak is placed far enough from the heat and 



228 MEAT 

turned often enough to prevent charring or over-browning. If desired, 
the steak may be turned only once. For a rare or medium well-done steak 
the cooking temperature does not need to be lowered, but for a well-done 
steak, or for one thicker than 1^2 inches, the temperature may be lowered 
after the browning is accomplished. Many people prefer steak cooked at a 
constant, fairly low temperature. The interior of the medium well-done 
steak is then more uniform in appearance, being pinkish throughout. Many 
steaks cooked at high temperatures are likely to have a gray surface layer, 
a thin pink layer, and an uncooked center portion. The outer surface of 
the steak does not brown so well at the lower temperature, but these con- 
noisseurs think this is more than compensated for by the uniformity of the 
interior of the steak. Increased browning of the surface at the lower tem- 
perature may be acquired by sprinkling with a small amount of sugar. 

The searing time and the total cooking time vary with the temperature 
used, the stage of cookery, and the thickness of the steak. The total time 
for a medium-done steak 1 inch thick is 7 to 10 minutes when seared. 
With a low, constant temperature the cooking time for the same steak may 
be increased to 20 minutes. 

Chops. Chops of veal, lamb, and pork may be broiled or pan broiled. 
Thicker chops, at least % inch thick, but mutton, particularly, as thick 
as 2 inches, are easier to cook without drying out than thin chops. The 
time of cooking varies with the temperature and the thickness of the chop 
from about 8 to 30 minutes. Pork and veal are usually cooked well done. 
Pork chops require about 10 to 20 minutes, and chops of veal and lamb 
% to 1 inch in thickness about 8 to 15 minutes. 

Less tender cuts. The less tender cuts are used for pot-roasts, Swiss 
steak, braised meat dishes, stews, and soups. If ground, the meat is cooked 
as a tender cut. 

The less tender cuts are usually cooked by moist heat and at fairly low 
temperatures. The aim is to cook the meat so that the structural proteins, 
the connective tissues, are softened yet not completely dissolved and the 
plasma proteins of the fibers are not made tough, rubbery, or stringy. If this 
is successful, a tender yet easily sliced meat is the result. If the connective 
tissues are entirely dissolved, the meat is not slicable. 

The less tender cuts are often pounded, or seasoned flour is pounded 
into the meat, or the surface is floured and seared. Pounding appears to be 
a good means of increasing the tenderness of some of the tougher cuts, 
particularly those containing a great deal of connective tissue and little fat 
or when they are not ripened. The flour absorbs and holds moisture; thus 
to this extent the meat appears less dry. Better grades of less tender cuts 
containing more fat and cuts from carcasses of younger animals from 
which rigor has passed do not need to be pounded. 

Cured meats. Some of the common cuts of cured pork are regular hams, 
skinned hams, shoulders, shoulder butts, and bacon. The loin, cured, is 



COVERED AND UNCOVERED PANS 229 

sometimes called Canadian bacon. Cured lean meats, because of the action 
of the salt during curing, are already fairly dry so they should always be 
cooked to prevent as little moisture loss as possible. This is usually accom- 
plished most easily by slow cooking at low temperatures. 

Hams. Hams may be cured with a light or a heavy salt cure. The mild- 
cured ones do not need soaking over night or parboiling before baking. 
Hams with a heavy salt cure are improved in flavor by soaking over night 
or for 24 hours. 

Hams are roasted in open pans on a rack, fat side up, at 125°C. (about 
250°F.) to an interior temperature of 70° to 75°C. If the oven will not 
maintain as low a temperature as this, 300°F. may be used. 

For cooking hams in water, a simmering temperature, 83°C., produces 
a tender, juicy ham. Water temperatures as low as 75°C. may be used. 
Hams cooked in water have the cooking losses decreased by cooling over 
night in the liquor in which they were cooked, but the cooking losses are 
influenced by the temperature of the liquor. Child found that the cooking 
losses gradually decreased as the temperature of the liquor decreased. The 
smallest losses, hence the greatest hydration of the ham, occurred at 1.6°C. 
(35°F.). In fact the hams averaged a slight gain in weight when put in 
the refrigerator and the liquor cooled to this temperature. With lowering 
the temperature below 1.6°C. the losses increased. 

The time necessary for baking or cooking ham in water will vary with 
the size of the ham and the cooking temperature used. For the tempera- 
tures given, hams weighing about 12 to 13 pounds require about 23 to 25 
minutes; those weighing 18 to 20 pounds require about 18 to 20 minutes 
per pound. 

Bacon. Bacon should be cooked at a temperature below the smoking 
temperature of the bacon fat. Slow cooking at low temperatures is best. 
For large quantities of bacon an excellent method is to spread the slices 
on a wire rack, place in a pan, and bake in the oven at 160°C. for about 
18 minutes. The bacon needs no turning. 

Covered and uncovered pans for roasting meat. Grindley and 
Mojoinner state regarding the losses occurring in roasting beef in covered 
and uncovered pans: ''The total losses were greater when the meats were 
roasted in a covered pan than when they were cooked m open pans, owing 
chiefly to the increased amount of water removed. In the same time and at 
the. same temperature the meat was more thoroughly cooked in the cov- 
ered than in the open pans, possibly because the temperature of the meat 
was higher in the closed pan." However, they based their conclusions on 
results of experiments with 1 covered and 15 open pans. 

The Cooking Committee of the Cooperative Meat Investigations uses 
uncovered pans for cooking all experimental roasts and advises the use of 
uncovered pans in the home. In general the cooking losses are less and the 
meat more palatable in the uncovered pan, although with such very small 



230 



MEAT 



roasts as half of a chicken opposite results may occur. The cooking time 
is shorter when covered pans are used. 

Pressure cooker. Gortner, in speaking of the moisture content of dried 
biological materials, says it depends upon three variables : temperature, 
pressure, and time. He adds that the moisture content of a sample should 
not be given w^ithout a statement of the condition under which it was dried. 
One question often asked is why meat cooked in a pressure cooker at a high 
temperature is tender and not dry. The answer is determined by the meat 
and these three variables. There would be a far greater tendency to dry the 
fibers at a high temperature and in a partial vacuum. 




Fig. 24. — Some types of skewers used for roasting meat. 

The use of skewers. Muscle tissue conducts heat slowly. Most metals 
conduct heat rapidly. Morgan and Nelson used skewers in cooking stand- 
ing rib roasts. The skewers were made with a long, narrow portion, about 
the size of a lead pencil, that was inserted in the meat. The other end of 
the skewer was in a spiral to give greater surface for receiving the heat 
from the oven, and thus conducting it into the meat. Pictures of the dif- 
ferent types of skewers used in meats are shown in Fig. 24. They found 
that ''the roasting speed was increased 30 to 45 per cent when nickel- 
plated copper skewers were used. Similarly, smaller and less regular de- 
creases in total shrinkage of weight of meat were found in the skewered 
as compared with unskewered roasts." They found the efficiency of the 
skewers in shortening the cooking period greater when a high oven tem- 
perature was maintained throughout the cooking period. 



CONSTANT TEMPERATURE METHOD 231 



Cooking Temperatures 

The best cooking temperatures for meat may not be the same for all 
conditions. As a general rule, it is agreed that low or medium temperatures 
are better than high ones for cooking meat. Yet some samples of meat do 
not seem to be toughened by any method of cooking; that is, if one 
deliberately sets out to show that higher temperatures toughen a piece of 
meat, while the same cut from the other side of the same animal cooked at 
a lower temperature is tender, the results are often not consistent. 

Advantages of low temperatures. In general, lower cooking tem- 
peratures result (1) in less cooking loss, (2) in more juicy meat, (3) in 
more uniformly cooked meat, and (4) in longer cooking time. The meat 
is more uniform in color and more juicy throughout; whereas at a higher 
temperature, the meat is more gray and dry at the surface, there being a 
sharper contrast between the meat near the surface and that at the center 
of the cut. A longer cooking time may be an advantage, for the home- 
maker may safely leave the meat cooking while she attends church, etc. 

Disadvantages of low temperatures. Often the meat (1) does not 
brown as attractively at the lower temperature, although occasionally the 
opposite is true, and (2) a longer cooking time is required. A long cooking 
time may also be a disadvantage. 

Searing method. The Cooking Committee of Cooperative Meat In- 
vestigations formerly used a searing method for cooking experimental roasts 
of fresh meat. The roast was seared for 20 minutes at 250° to 275°C. 
(about 480° to 525°F.) and was then transferred to a second oven at 
125 °C. for the remainder of the cooking period. It was necessary to transfer 
experimental roasts to a second oven so that results from different labora- 
tories could be compared, for different ovens cool at different rates. Obvi- 
ously the homemaker cannot use two ovens. Hence a lower temperature, 
200° to 240°C. (about 400° to 450°F.), is recommended for the house- 
wife in searing because the oven will remain at a fairly high temperature 
for some time after the temperature control has been set at the lower 
temperature. 

Searing. Searing browns the meat, develops a characteristic surface 
flavor, and starts the cooking. Often the statement is made that searing by 
coagulating the muscle tissue on the surface prevents loss of interior fluids 
and extractives. Searing increases the cooking losses, though the losses 
may be largely surface ones. Searing also does not prevent the loss of 
interior juices in all instances. 

Constant temperature method. At present the Cooking Committee 
uses a constant oven temperature 150°C. (about 300°F.) for cooking 
experimental roasts, with the exception of pork, which is cooked at 175°C. 
(about 350°F.). At this temperature the cooking time and losses are prac- 



232 MEAT 

tically the same as for the searing method formerly used. The exterior is 
also browned to about the same extent, although it is sometimes less brown. 
The homemaker will find that in using a constant temperature excellent 
roasts will be obtained if she uses 150°, 125°, or 175°C. Some ovens will 
not hold as low a temperature as 125 °C. (250°F.), even though the 
regulator carries this temperature. The meat will not brown as readily at 
the lower temperature, but this can be overcome by using a mixture of salt 
and sugar or sugar alone to sprinkle over the meat. The meat cooked at 
175°C. will not be as uniformly cooked as at the lower temperature. 

Stages to Which Meat Is Cooked: Rare, Medium, and Well Done 

The longer a piece of meat is cooked, the more the interior color changes 
from pink or red to gray, and the greater the cooking losses. Some meats 
like veal and pork are cooked well done, whereas beef may be cooked rare. 
There is no definite stage between a rare and a medium-done piece of meat 
or between a medium well-done one and a well-done one. The meat passes 
from one stage to another gradually, so that there is no definite end point. 
Heat penetrates slowly into the interior of a large piece of meat, and the 
center of the meat, unless very much over-cooked, never attains as high a 
temperature as the meat near the surface. 

Rare meat. Grindley and Sprague have suggested, for convenience, that 
meat with an interior temperature at its center of 60 °C. or below be called 
rare. Such meats are juicier than meats cooked well done. Nearly all the 
interior may be a bright red color or only a small portion around the center 
of the meat may be red. The extent or uniformity of the red color depends 
upon the cooking temperature. As the heat penetrates the meat the color 
near the surface becomes gray. If the cooking temperature is high, this gray 
layer may extend nearly to the center of the meat. If the meat is cooked at 
a low temperature the gray color extends only a short depth and the color 
of the interior of the meat is nearly uniform. Thus it can be seen that if 
different cooking temperatures are used the interior of different pieces of 
meat cooked to the same inner temperature may vary decidedly in appear- 
ance. The intensity of the red color may vary with other factors as well as 
with the cooking temperature. The interior of cooked meat ripened 40 to 
60 days is grayer in color than meat that has not been ripened. Veal cooked 
to the same inner temperature, and with the same cooking temperature, is 
grayer, and has less red color, than beef. Rare meat also has more of the 
original meat flavor than well-done meat, for not so much of the fluids and 
extractives giving flavor to the meat has been lost. 

Medium well-done meat. Grindley and Sprague have suggested that 
meat that has reached an inner temperature of 60° to 70°C. be called 
medium well done. Here the color also varies with the temperature of 
cooking, the degree to which the meat has been ripened, and in some in- 



FACTORS AFFECTING THE TIME IN COOKING MEAT 233 

stances with the age of the animal and the kind of meat. Rare and medium 
well-done meats are probably more often associated with the color of the 
cooked meat. Since the color of the cooked meat varies with different con- 
ditions, the division into rare, medium well done and well done on the 
basis of inner temperature of the meat is only an arbitrary one and not 
always satisfactory. Most people would be agreed that medium well-done 
meat should not be a deep red or pink, but should show some pink color. 
Well-done meat. Meat that has a uniform gray color throughout the 
entire interior of the meat is usually called well done. With veal, this 
stage of cookery is sometimes reached before or by the time the inner tem- 
perature of the meat has reached 71°C. This may also be true of beef that 
has ripened sufficiently. Unripened beef requires a higher temperature than 
7l°C. before a uniform gray color is attained, when a low cooking tem- 
perature is used. But to some persons the term well done is associated with 
the degree of cookery, that is, the separation of the muscle fibers due to 
formation of gelatin from the connective tissue. It may also refer to the 
dryness of the meat and the loss of juices. The meat may be cooked until 
it reaches a temperature far above 7l°C., often from 80° to 85°C. for 
roasts and from 95° to 99°C. for braised meat. 

Factors Affecting the Time Required for Cooking Meat 

Directions for cooking meat usually state the time of cooking in terms 
of minutes per pound. At best this can only serve as a guide, for several 
factors may cause variation in the length of time required to cook a piece 
of meat. The only way of knowing when the interior of a piece of meat 
has reached a definite temperature and thus a definite stage of cookery is 
to insert something in the center of the meat by which the interior tem- 
perature may be read. For this purpose a thermometer or a thermocouple 
may be used. The easiest method for household use is the insertion of a 
thermometer into the meat. Two types of thermometers may be used : a 
right-angled thermometer with the temperature scale on the horizontal arm 
(see Fig. 23) ; or a very short tube- type thermometer about 6 or 8 inches 
long with the temperature scale on the upper half. The latter must be short 
to keep the top from touching the upper part of the oven, particularly the 
small gas ovens and many electric ovens. Thus the graduated scale is con- 
densed, which makes it more difficult to read. The short thermometer is 
preferable for small roasts of meat and for meat with soft fibers. The right- 
angled thermometer is suitable for beef roasts, ham, leg of veal, and lamb. 
It is convenient for taking temperatures of custards, cakes, and other foods, 
for it can be supported by the horizontal arm from a shelf in the oven. 

The following factors affect the time required to cook meat. (1) The 
cooking temperature. (2) Weight. Surface area. The shortest distance to 
the center of the thickest portion of the meat. (3) The stage to which the 



234 



MEAT 



meat is cooked — rare, or well done. (4) The composition of the meat. 
(5) The degree of ripeness. 

The cooking temperature. The higher the cooking temperature the 
more rapidly will a piece of meat reach a definite temperature, for with 
a higher temperature at the surface, the more rapidly heat will penetrate 
to the interior of the meat. As oven temperatures during the cooking of 
meat may vary many degrees, this factor causes a wide variation in the 
time required for cooking meat.

Weight. Surface area. Shortest distance to thickest portion of 
the meat. The time for cooking meat is often expressed in minutes per 
pound, but it is also a well-known fact that a heavy piece of meat of the 
same shape as one of light weight will require a shorter time per pound 
for cooking if the oven temperatures are the same. The reason for this 
can best be explained with the aid of a diagram. Suppose a cube 1 inch 
square weighs 1 ounce. It contains 6 square inches of surface area (see Fig. 
25, diagram A), and the distance from the sides to the center {s — c in the 
figure) is ^ inch. If the cube is enlarged to 10 times its original size, dia- 
gram B, its weight is increased to 1000 ounces, its surface to 600 square 



TIME PER POUND 235 

inches or 100 times its original surface area, and the distance {s — c) to 
the center is 5 inches, or 10 times the distance of cube A. In other words, 
the distance to the center does not increase in the same ratio as the surface 
area and the weight. In heating these cubes, if the heat travels through the 
material at a uniform rate it will not take 1000 times as long to bring the 
center of cube 5 to a definite temperature as cube A, but 10 times as long. 
The diameter of a sphere or a cylinder does not increase in the same pro- 
portion as the surface area and weight. A piece of meat is not shaped like 
a cube, but some are cylindrical, and in roasts of similar shape the weight 
increases more rapidly than the distance that the heat must penetrate. 

Rolled roasts are cylindrical in shape. Here the length of the radius 
(r) determines the time for the heat to penetrate to the center of the 
roast, unless the length of the cylinder is shorter than its diameter. See Fig. 
25, diagram C. 

In a standing rib roast. Fig. 25, diagram D, it is not the distance to the 
center of the meat, which may be somewhere near the portion marked x, 
but the distance through the thick portion of the meat, which affects the 
time required for cooking. The heat travels in from the top along the line 
tc, from the side along the line sc, and from the bottom along the line be. 
Ham, leg of lamb, and leg of veal have the thickest portion of the meat 
nearer one end than the center of the meat. 

It is obvious from the diagrams that the shorter the distance to the center 
of the piece of meat the more rapidly the heat will penetrate; the longer 
the distance, the more time will be required. Weight and surface area are 
not satisfactory to determine cooking time, for the size of the piece and 
its shape determine the distance to the thickest part of the meat. A thin, 
wide roast will cook in less time and a thick compact one will take a longer 
time. The following examples illustrate this. A standing rib roast weigh- 
ing 11.6 pounds required 1 hour and 52 minutes to reach an inner tem- 
perature of 57°C., when cooked for 20 minutes at 275°C. and for the 
remainder of the cooking period at 125°C. This gives an average of 9.3 
minutes per pound. Another roast weighing 11.5 pounds and with the same 
cooking conditions required 3 hours and 43 minutes, averaging 19.3 min- 
utes per pound. The first roast consisted of five ribs and was thin and wide ; 
the latter consisted of three ribs and was thick and compact. If roasts are 
always of the same shape and the same cooking temperature is always 
used the time for cooking can be estimated more accurately than when the 
shape of the roast varies. 

A large piece of meat cooks in a shorter time per pound than a small 
one if all other conditions are standardized. Smaller hams and legs of 
lamb require more minutes per pound than larger ones. The same is true of 
poultry, smaller chickens and turkeys requiring more minutes per pound 
than larger ones. 

Time per pound. Minutes per pound for some roasts are given in 
Tables 29 and 30, but if not taken in connection with cooking tempera- 



236 



MEAT 



tures, size, and the stage of cookery, they are worth very little for a guide 
in cooking meat. Most of the roasts given in these tables were transferred 
to a second oven after searing instead of lowering the temperature of the 
oven in which the roast was seared. This gives a slightly longer time per 
pound. There may be considerable variation in the time per pound as can 
be seen in Table 29. In general, the time per pound is longer with the 
smaller roasts. With a very thin roast the thickness of the slice influences 
the rate of heat penetration more than the other dimensions or its weight.

Surface area. Since time per pound does not give a dependable basis 
for cooking meat an effort is often made to express cooking time in relation 
to the surface area. Often this is expressed in the following way. The 
greater the surface area the shorter the time required for cooking a piece 
of meat if all other conditions are standardized. From the diagrams, Fig. 
25, it can be seen that this method would give a less variable cooking time, 
at least for some pieces of meat of certain shape, than time per pound. 
This method of expressing time for cooking is also more difficult to deter- 
mine in the home. 



TEMPERATURE OF MEAT 237 

Stage to which the meat is cooked. Cooking meat rare does not re- 
quire so long a time as cooking medium well done or well done, because 
the last two stages require a higher inner temperature. See Table 29. 

The composition of the meat. The proportion of fat and lean in the 
meat affects the time required for cooking. There has been much confusion 
regarding the rate of heat conduction by fat. In physiology, one is told that 
a layer of fat over the muscles prevents loss of body heat, because the fat 
is a poor conductor of heat. In articles on cooking various foods, one often 
sees the statement that fat conducts heat more readily than muscle tissue. 
These two seemingly contradictory statements are explainable. Redfield has 
offered a solution. In studying the rate of heat penetration in canning pork 
and beef, she found, with all other conditions standardized, that the tem- 
perature at the center of the can of pork rose more slowly than the tem- 
perature at the center of the can of beef. In order to determine whether 
this slower heat conduction in the pork was due to its greater fat content, 
she packed some cans with suet and others with beef round free of all 
visible fat. She found that the temperature of the suet rose more slowly 
than that of the beef round until the melting point of the suet was reached. 
As soon as the fat melted, it conducted the heat faster than the beef round. 
Fat in a liquid form in cooking is a good conductor of heat, but if it is in 
a solid form it is a poor conductor of heat. In Redfield's experiments, the 
fat escaped from the fat cells, the connective tissue forming a piece about 
the size of a marble around the point of the thermocouple. 

The writer's experimental classes, in processing suet, fat pork, lean beef, 
and lean pork in pint cans in a hot water bath, have found the rate of heat 
penetration to be much slower in the fat meat than in the lean, even at 
temperatures of 90 °C. and above. When the suet was packed tightly into 
the jar so that the tissues surrounding the fat cells were broken, Redfield's 
results were checked. 

Degree of ripeness. Alexander and Clark found that increasing the 
length of the ripening period after slaughter shortened the time required 
to roast leg of lamb. As the ripening period increased beyond two days 
after slaughter, the cooking shrinkage became smaller and the rate of heat 
penetration more rapid. 

Thus it seems that, if the connective tissue remains unbroken, as it does 
in the more solid fat and the interior fat of meat cuts, it prevents the fat 
globules from touching each other and delays heat penetration. 

Rise of Interior Temperature of Meat after the Cooking Process 

Has Been Stopped 

When a roast is removed from the oven or a piece of cooked meat is 
removed from the cooking utensil the temperature in the interior may con- 
tinue to rise. Heat is carried to the interior of the meat by conduction, that 
is, from fiber to fiber. When the cooking process is stopped the temperature 
of the meat half way to the center is higher than the temperature at the 



238 MEAT 

center. This heat is conducted both toward the center and the outer edge 
of the meat, and as a consequence the temperature at the center of the 
meat rises. 

The factors that may determine the extent of this rise in temperature 
after removal from the oven are: (1) the cooking temperature; (2) the 
inner temperature of the meat when the cooking process is stopped; (3) 
the size of the piece of meat; (4) the composition. It must be remembered 
that each of these factors may have an influence on the temperature rise 
of the same piece of meat, and that under some conditions one factor may 
influence it more than another. Thus they cannot be considered separately, 
for the high cooking temperature of a steak or roast may affect the tem- 
perature rise more than the size. Yet under some conditions size is a greater 
factor in determining temperature rise. 

Cooking temperature and temperature rise after the cooking 
process is stopped. The higher the cooking temperature the greater the 
tendency for a rise in the inner temperature of the meat. A higher cooking 
temperature produces a higher surface temperature, and consequently results 
in a higher rise at the interior after the cooking process is stopped. 

Inner temperature. The lower the inner temperature at which the 
cooking is stopped, the greater the tendency for the rise of inner tempera- 
ture. This is because with a low inner temperature there is a wider varia- 
tion between the inner and surface heat, which results in greater rise of 
inner temperature. The inner temperature of foods that contain a high 
percentage of water, such as cake, meat, and potatoes, never rises above 
the boiling point of their juices. Heat supplied in amounts greater than 
the amount needed to reach the boiling point of the juices is used in 
evaporating the liquid. It is impossible to raise the inner temperature of 
meat above 100°C. without having a very dry, charred product. 

Size. In larger pieces of meat, the size of the piece is not so important 
a factor as those mentioned above in affecting the temperature rise of the 
interior after cooking has been stopped. But a piece of meat may be so 
small or thin that the inner temperature does not rise after the cooking 
process is stopped, because of the rapid cooling from the surface. 

Composition and duration of temperature rise. No definite relation 
has been established between composition of the meat and the extent of the 
inner temperature rise after cooking. It does seem to affect the duration 
of the temperature rise more than the extent. Meat containing a great deal 
of fat and meat that has a very thick layer of fat on the surface, ^ to 1 
inch or more, requires a long time for the inner temperature to reach its 
maximum point. A roast with such a layer of fat may take as long as 1 
to 1^ hours to reach its maximum inner temperature, whereas a lean roast 
of the same shape, and cooked under the same conditions, may take only 12 
to 30 minutes to reach its maximum interior temperature, after the cooking 
process is stopped. 



METHOD OF COOKING AND COOKING LOSSES 239 



Factors Affecting the Losses That Occur During the Cooking 

of Meat 

The total loss that occurs during the cooking of meat includes the losses 
known as drippings and the volatile losses. The greater part of the volatile 
loss is from evaporation of w^ater. It may include volatile substances from 
the decomposition of fat and volatile aromatic substances. The drippings 
include fat, w^ater, salts, and both nitrogenous and non-nitrogenous ex- 
tractives. 

Time, stage of cookery and losses. The stage of cookery is one fac- 
tor that affects the cooking loss. Meat cooked rare gives less total cooking 
loss than meat cooked well done. A longer time is required to reach the 
well-done stage, if all other conditions are the same. Thus length of time 
of cooking and the stage to which the meat is cooked are related factors. 

Composition and cooking losses. Meat containing a high percentage 
of fat cooked under standardized conditions gives greater cooking losses than 
lean meat. The amount of drippings is always greater for the fat meat 
than for similar lean cuts from the same kind of animal. This is also true 
for poultry. Cooking temperatures that melt the fat cause a heavy fat loss 
from the meat. 

Surface area and cooking losses. The shape and surface area of the 
meat also influence the loss that occurs during cooking. The greater the 
surface area of the meat, the greater the area at which losses may occur. 
Compact pieces of meat with correspondingly small surface areas give 
smaller losses than irregular-shaped pieces with greater surface areas. 

Cooking temperature and cooking losses. The cooking tempera- 
ture is in many instances the principal factor in determining the percentage 
of weight that is lost during cooking. Occasionally time may be a more 
important factor than cooking temperature in its effect on the resulting 
losses. For example, cooking losses were greater for halves of chicken roasted 
at 125°C. (about 250°F.) than for the corresponding halves roasted at 
175°C. (about 350°F.). In the former instance, twice as long was required 
for the interior of the thigh to reach 85°C. (185°F.). Alexander and 
Clark found similar results for very small, poorly finished legs of lamb. 
However, in general the higher the cooking temperature the greater the 
cooking losses; the lower the cooking temperature the smaller the cooking 
losses. Intermediate cooking temperatures give corresponding intermediate 
cooking losses. 

Method of cooking and cooking losses. The method of cooking the 
meat may also influence the cooking loss. A broiled steak may have a far 
greater total loss than a pan-broiled one, yet the interior of the meat may 
be just as juicy. The radiant heat as well as the temperature reached usually 
causes a high fat loss from the edge of the boiled steaks, whereas a pan- 
broiled one may have a small fat loss. 



240 MEAT 

Degree of ripeness. Alexander and Clark found cooking losses de- 
creased with longer ripening. 

The Losses Occurring in Cooked Meats 

The cooking losses vary with the factors mentioned, time, stage of cook- 
ery, cooking temperature, surface area, and composition. Usually, the longer 
a piece of meat is cooked, the greater the cooking losses; but this is not 
always true in practise, for owing to differences in surface area and com- 
position of different meats, it is not possible always to standardize all 
conditions. 

Meats show wide variations in cooking losses. The cooking losses 
in meat may vary from 5 per cent to 50 per cent. This is a wide variation. 
Obviously, meat that has lost 50 per cent of the uncooked weight is either 
very dry or has lost an immense amount of surface fat. Swiss steak was 
cooked to determine the effect of different percentages of loss on texture 
and palatability of the meat. The ones with 50 per cent loss were very 
dry and unappetizing, even for a person who prefers meat very well done. 
Here there was little surface fat, because of the cut and type of meat 
used. A roast with a great deal of surface fat may suffer a rather high 
loss and be far more palatable than a lean piece of meat. But, in general, 
a 40 to 50 per cent loss leaves the meat much too dry. 

Well-done meat usually shows greater cooking losses. In general, meats 
cooked rare sustain less loss; the losses may vary from 5 to 20 per cent. 
Under some conditions they may be higher. Well-done meats usually have 
a higher cooking loss, from 20 to 45 per cent. However, meats cooked until 
well done at very low cooking temperatures may have less than 15 per cent 
cooking losses, so that it is impossible to give definite figures for any 
definite stage of cookery. 

In Table 30 some cooking losses are given, and since cooking losses 
without cooking temperatures and stage of cookery mean little, these are 
included. The composition of the meat and relative surface area are not 
indicated. 

Cooking losses in steaks and chops. The losses in steaks may vary 
to a great extent, but usually seem to come within 10 to 40 per cent, when 
ordinary cooking methods and cooking times are used. High cooking tem- 
peratures cause a greater fat loss from around the edge of the steak and 
also brown it better, giving a more attractive appearance, unless the tem- 
perature is so high that the fat is charred. A steak may be cooked at a 
high temperature, and have a greater loss, due to high temperature, yet 
be rare in the center, because of a shorter cooking time, than a steak cooked 
at a low temperature. Steaks and chops that are cooked rare or medium 
well done may lose from 10 to 25 per cent of the uncooked weight. Steaks 
and chops cooked well done usually have higher losses, from 20 to 40 per 
cent. The above figures are taken from losses obtained in cooking steaks and

chops in class work. They are approximate and do not apply to all con- 
ditions. Steaks and chops put in a cold pan and cooked at a low tempera- 
ture for the entire cooking period show low cooking losses. They are juicy 
but do not brown as well as ones seared at a high temperature, and the fat 
does not brown well. 

Losses in meats cooked in water. The losses of meat cooked in water 
kept at a boiling temperature are usually higher than those cooked in water 
held at a temperature of 85 °C. or lower. Often the loss is twice as great 
in the boiling water. The extent of surface area, composition, and time of 
cooking affect the loss. Commercially boiled hams are often cooked at a 
temperature of about 75 °C., for this results in a lower cooking loss, about 
15 per cent, which gives a texture that cuts and slices well. One very lean

ham cooked in the laboratory in water at 82° with a total cooking loss of

20 to 25 per cent seems to give a flavor to the ham that is preferred by 
most persons. 

The Percentage of Cooked Meat That Is Edible

From the figures of Van Arsdale and Monroe it will be seen that the 
loin lamb chops have higher percentage edible portion that the rib lamb 
chops. Determinations of the weight of the cooked edible portion of rib 
and loin pork chops made in the author's laboratory give similar results, 
i.e., the loin pork chops have less waste than the rib pork chops. The 
percentage of edible round beef steak given by Van Arsdale and Monroe's 
results is much lower than the total edible portion for this cut of beef, on 
account of the large percentage of the portion served which was not eaten. 
Monroe and Van Arsdale have published results of experiments wnth roasts 
of beef, veal, lamb, and pork. 

The most extensive w^ork on determining the weight and amount of 
edible and servable meat with which the author is familiar is that of Mc- 
Elhinney. This work was done in the Institutional Laboratory at Iowa 
State College. The figures in the following tables are compiled from Mc- 
Elhinney's results.

243 



The searing temperature for all the meats with the exception of the 
ham was 250° to 275°C. for 20 minutes, and they were then cooked at 
125°C. for the remainder of the cooking period. The baked hams were 
cooked at 150°C. for 30 minutes and then at 125°C. for the remainder 
of the time. For the boiled hams a pint of water was allowed for each 
pound, and they were cooked at a temperature of 82° to 83 °C. The degree 
of doneness was determined by the use of a chemical thermometer inserted 
into the roast as previously described.

Poultry 

Vernon determined the shrinkage in dressing and cooking poultry, using 
fryers, roasters, and hens. Lowe and Vernon determined the dressing and 
cooking losses for broilers, fryers, roasters, capons, and hens. All the poultry 
was roasted except the fryers and broilers. The broilers were broiled under 
a gas flame in the oven, the fryers were dredged in flour and fried in fat. 
In frying, the lean fryers absorbed fat, and the fat ones lost fat. 

The inedible portion includes the weight of all parts of the fowls served 
but not eaten.

The term dressed weight is used as in poultry classification and market- 
ing. A dressed bird is bled and has the feathers removed. Market prices 
from butcher shops are usually for the dressed and not the drawn weight. 
The drawn weight is the weight after removal of the head, feet, and diges- 
tive organs. 

As given in Table 35, the average losses for all classes of poultry are 
12, 20, 19, and 12 per cent for dressing, drawing, cooking, and inedible 
loss, respectively. Thus the cooked meat is less than 40 per cent of the 
live weight. 

For the convenience of those buying poultry from the markets, the data 
in the preceding table are given in the following table, but based on the 
drawn weight, which makes the percentages higher. 

Lowe and Keltner found that the edible meat without skin, based on the 
uncooked weight of 116 halves of roasters as prepared for the oven, aver- 
aged slightly more than 50 per cent. When the skin was included the 
edible portion was considerably higher. 

The cost of the edible meat and of the total edible portion for the dif- 
ferent classes of poultry given in Tables 35 and 36 is given in Table 37. 

Roasting of poultry. The percentages lost in cooking poultry reported 
by Lowe and Vernon, and tabulated in Tables 35 and 36, were obtained 
by roasting the chickens in tight-fitting covered roasters at 250°C. for 30 
minutes and then the temperature was lowered to 175°C. The pans were

uncovered for the last 15 minutes of cooking and the heat increased to 
brown the roasts. In the covered pans used in these experiments, very little 
browning occurred while the roasts were covered. 

Methods and cooking temperatures. In roasting poultry, one is con- 
fronted with the problem of cooking tender and less tender muscles at the 
same time. As a result, when the breast is at its prime, the thigh and leg 



ROASTING OF POULTRY 247 

muscles may be slightly tough and, vice versa, when the thigh and leg are 
cooked sufficiently to soften the connective tissue, the breast is past its prime 
and is becoming dry. 

Another problem in cooking poultry is the skin. If it is moist and tender, 
the appearance is less attractive because it is not so brown. When the skin 
is not consumed this point is not important. 

The degree of fatness and its distribution, the degree of post-mortem 
changes or ripening, the age, and the size may affect the cooking time and 
losses of roasters. In addition, breed, sex, and the feed the bird has received 
may have some effect on these factors. Hence, for fair experimental tests 
the cuts should be paired. To do this Lowe and Keltner divided roasting 
chickens into halves, the halves being tested one against the other to 
determine the effect of the cooking temperature, covering the pan, and 
basting on cooking losses, cooking time, and palatability of the meat. They 
found the cooking losses were practically the same for halves cooked at 
125°C. (about 250°F.) and at 175°C. (about 350°F.), but the cooking 
time at the lower temperature was more than twice as long as at the 
higher temperature. The differences in palatability scores for the breast 
and thigh meat cooked at the two temperatures were practically negligible, 
with the exception that the breast scored higher in juiciness at the higher 
temperature, which was probably related to the shorter cooking time. One 
drawback in cooking halves of birds was the tendency for the muscles of 
the breast to separate and draw back, which is of course not encountered 
in roasting the whole bird. In all these tests the half of chicken was re- 
moved from the oven when the interior temperature of the thigh was 
85°C. (185°F.). 

If a searing instead of a constant temperature method is desired, cooking 
the roast uncovered for 20 minutes at 200°-230°C. (about 395°-450°F.) 
and then lowering the temperature to 125°C. for the remainder of the 
cooking period produces a juicy roast. Covering for the last 20 or 30 min- 
utes of cooking increases the tenderness of the skin, as the confined steam 
moistens the skin. 

In tests of the searing and constant temperature methods for cooking 
turkeys, in an uncovered pan and basting the turkey every half hour, the 
constant temperature of 150°C. (about 300°F.) has in general proved 
very satisfactory, the meat being tender and very juicy. 

Covered and uncovered pans. Lowe and Keltner cooked halves of 22 
birds covered, the other halves uncovered. All were cooked at a constant 
oven temperature of 150°C. and until the interior temperature of the 
thigh reached 85 °C. The cooking time was approximately twice as long for 
uncovered as for covered halves. The total and volatile cooking losses were 
greater for the uncovered halves, but the drippings were greater for covered 
halves. The scores showed that in aroma, flavor, and juiciness the breast 
of the uncovered halves was more desirable than the breast of the covered 



248 MEAT 

halves. No preference for the thigh was shown for either covered or un- 
covered halves. 

Covering the birds for the last 20 minutes of the cooking period short- 
ened the cooking time, decreased the cooking losses, and increased the 
tenderness and palatability of the skin but not of the meat. The majority 
of the scorers preferred the uncovered halves. 

Interior temperatures for cooking poultry. The insertion of thermometers 
into muscles of chicken in early tests was not satisfactory, as the ther- 
mometer and bulbs were too large. However, it was found that the larger 
thermometers could be used successfully by inserting them into the stuffing, 
either through the front or rear cavities of the fowl. For turkeys and geese 
the thicker part of the stuffing is towards the rear of the carcass; hence it 
was preferable to insert the thermometer at the rear. 

Lowe and Keltner used in their study a small light thermometer with a 
very short, small bulb. Placing the bulb of the thermometer into the thickest 
portion of the thigh muscles and cooking the chicken until a temperature 
of 85 °C. was reached proved satisfactory. The most desirable temperature 
to which the breast muscles should be cooked has not been determined. 
Since the breast muscles tended to separate when half of a bird was cooked, 
thermometers were not used successfully in the breast. However, in the 
preliminary studies the temperature of the breast was usually 2° to 4° 
higher than that of the thigh. 

Evidently the meat of large fowls is juicier if the interior temperature 
of the stuffing is lower than for small fowls. This is probably due to their 
size, the large quantity of stuffing that they hold increasing the distance 
to the middle of the stuffing. 

When chickens were roasted until the interior temperature of the stuffing 
reached 80° to 83°C., the meat was desirable; but, when cooked to 85°C., 
the breast of some birds was dry, the drippings and particularly their 
moisture content increasing rapidly in the last few minutes of cooking. 
This might indicate that for some birds, depending somewhat upon degree 
of ripening and other factors, this is a critical temperature. As this point 
is reached or exceeded, the tendency for the meat of the chicken is to 
become dry and the drippings loss to increase. 

For turkeys weighing 16 to 20 pounds after stuffing, an interior tempera- 
ture of 75° to 82°C. of the stuffing resulted in juicy meat. But for turkeys 
weighing 25 to 30 pounds after stuffing a lower temperature gives better 
results. The type of stuffing used may make some difference in the juiciness 
of the meat and the cooking losses. Lowe and Keltner found that stuffing 
made from 1 -day-old bread, 100 grams, butter 50 grams, and salt 2 grams, 
but without the addition of liquid, absorbed an average moisture content 
of 41.5 per cent. The amount of moisture absorbed varied from 14.6 to 
78.1 per cent. 

The above results and observations in cooking of poultry suggest that 
poultry may lose moisture rapidly after a certain temperature is reached, 



ROASTING OF POULTRY 



249 



with the result that the meat becomes quite dry. This loss of moisture 
seems to occur most rapidly at a temperature around 83° to 85°C. Some 
meats may become dry more readily within a short range of temperature 
than others. Ostwald states that *Tork can be distinguished from other 
meats by the fact that its water holding capacity suffers the least change 
when cooked or dried." The kind of food the bird has received may in- 
fluence the juiciness to a certain degree. 

Basting. Lowe and Keltner found that basting shortened the cooking 
period, but did not appreciably affect the cooking losses. Butter was used 
for basting. The salt was removed by washing, the butter was then melted, 
and the curd allowed to settle. The half of chicken was basted before 
putting in the oven, at the end of 30, and at the end of 60 minutes, a total 
of 20 grams of butter being used. Basting increased the desirability of the 
lean meat of both the thigh and breast. 

Time of cooking. Roasters weighing 4 to 5 pounds, dressed weight, re- 
quire about 35 minutes per pound to cook by the searing method. If estimate 
is based on the stuffed weight, about 30 minutes per pound is necessary. 
But considerable variation may be expected, larger roasters requiring a 
shorter and smaller ones a longer time. For the constant oven temperature, 
150°C. (about 300°F.), approximately the same time will be required 
as for the searing method though again considerable variation may be 
expected. 

Table 38, based on laboratory results, gives approximate time for roast- 
ing turkey at 150°C. Variation from this time will of course be found. The 
time given is for uncovered birds. A. shorter time will be required when 
the roast is covered.

Effect of feed on fat distribution. Maw has investigated the effect of 
cereals, yellow corn, wheat, oats, and barley on the amount and nature 
of the fat deposited in different parts of the body (flesh, abdominal fat, ex- 
ternal fat, and skin). Flesh as used was composed of the breast and leg 
muscles with external fat stripped clean. The wheat gave an excellent 
external appearance as it produced an external layer of fat over the carcass 



250

but relatively little fat distributed through the flesh. Table 39 gives his 
results :

Maw states that the fat laid down in the carcass is replacing the moisture. 
This fat in the cooked bird influences the apparent moistness of the flesh. 
The palatability tests indicated the corn-fed birds appeared the most moist, 
with the best flavor. The barley-fed meat was nearly like the corn-fed ; 
whereas the oat-fed and wheat-fed meats were the poorest in quality, the 
wheat-fed apparently being the driest and poorest in flavor. These birds 
were roasted at a constant temperature of 375 °F.

Beef Roasts 



Experiment 39. 

To determine the effect on beef roasts of cooking to different stages of 
doneness. 

1. PreparatioTi. Weigh the roast. Wipe with a damp cloth. A tracing may 
be made of the cut surfaces of the meat. Determine the place and depth for 
insertion of the thermometer. Measure the width of the roast. The thermometer 
is inserted half way. See Fig. 23, p. 225. To determine the depth to insert the 
thermometer, measure the distance on the two cut surfaces as indicated in 
Fig. 25, diagram D, p. 234. The distance should be the diameter of a circle, so 
that the bulb of the thermometer can be inserted equally distant from the top, 
the chine bone, and the bottom of the roast. If the depth on one cut surface is 
4 inches and on the other 4^^ inches, use an average of these two, or 4^ 
inches, for the distance represented by the diameter of the circle. Measure 
up from the center of the thermometer bulb 2]/^ inches on the stem and 
insert to this depth in the roast. The incision for the thermometer should be 
made with a very narrow knife blade, about % Inch in width, or a skewer 
so that the meat will fit tightly around the thermometer. For a rolled roast 
find the radius (one-half of the diameter) and Insert the center of ther- 
mometer bulb to this depth In the middle between the two ends of the roast. 

Weigh the thermometer and the cooking pan. Use an open pan. A common, 
sheet-Iron pan Is suitable for roasting. A standing-rib roast rests on the chine 
bone and rib ends, which keeps the roast above the drippings. See Fig. 23. 
A rolled roast Is laid on a rack with the fat side up. No water or seasoning 
are added. Record the inner temperature of the roast and oven at definite 
Intervals, 10, 15, or 20 minutes, during the cooking period. Cook by one of 
the following methods. If paired roasts are used, one may be cooked by a 
searing, the other by a constant temperature method. 






BEEF ROASTS 



255 



Searing method. For experimental comparisons sear the roast for 20 minutes 
at 250°-275°C. (about 480°-525°F.) and transfer at the end of 20 minutes 
to an oven at 125 °C. (about 255 °F.). For a searing method suitable for the 
home, sear at 220°C. (about 425°F.) for 20 minutes, then set the regulator 
for 125°C. (about 255°F.). 

Constant tetnperature fuethod. Place the roast in an oven with temperature 
of 150°C. (about 300°F.). 

Cook the roast until the thermometer registers 55°C. (131°F.). Note 
exterior appearance on removal from the oven. Note and record any change 
in interior temperature of the roast. When the temperature is constant, weigh 
the roast. Weigh pan and drippings. Cut the roast through the center. Describe 
its condition, its color, and uniformity of color throughout the roast, its sheen 
and amount of juice on the surface. Score for tenderness, flavor, and juiciness. 

If the volatile and drippings losses in the oven are to be determined sepa- 
rately from those after removal from the oven, the roast is weighed at the 
time it is removed from the oven and transferred to a weighed platter. When 
the maximum temperature is reached, the roast is reweighed to determine 
the volatile loss during the interval after removal from the oven and attain- 
ment of maximum interior temperature. The platter is reweighed to determine 
the drippings collected outside the oven. 

Samples for scoring. For scoring cut off the outside slice and lay aside, as 
the browned part will afFect the flavor. Cut as many slices as there are people 
to score. Cut from the same position in each roast and be sure that the same 
person gets slice 1 from all roasts, etc. If slices are very large they may be 
divided, but the same portion of each muscle should be given to the same 
scorer. 

Determine the percentage lost during cooking, the dripping loss and the vola- 
tile loss. Plot on graph paper the rise in inner temperature of the roast, during 
cooking and after removal from the oven. The weight of the bones and the 
per cent edible may also be determined.- Calculate the time per pound required 
for cooking. 

2. Repeat 1, but do not remove the roast from the oven until the inner 
temperature is 63°C. (145°F.). If desired the roast can be removed when the 
interior temperature reaches 61 °C. Compare with 1 for color, juiciness, tender- 
ness, flavor, loss of weight, and rise of temperature after removal from the 
oven. 

3. Repeat 1, but do not remove from the oven until the inner temperature 
is 75°C. Compare with 1 and 2. 

The following headings are suggested for records and may be used in all the 
following experiments, unless otherwise suggested. Where several roasts are to 
be cooked it is better to have mimeographed sheets for making records.

Results and conclusions. 

Experiment 40. 

To determine the rate of temperature rise near the surface of the roast as 
compared w^ith the center of the roast. 

1. Repeat Experiment 39,1, but place a second thermometer ^ inch from 
the surface of the roast. Take the readings on both thermometers every 10 
minutes. Remove from the oven when the temperature at the center is 55°C. 
Continue to record the changes in temperature. What differences do you note 
in the changes of temperature in the two portions of the roast? Plot on graph 
paper the rise in temperature in the two portions of the roast. Compute losses 
and make records as suggested under Experiment 39. 

Experiment 41. 

To determine the effect of cooking at different temperatures on standing 
beef rib roasts. 

Three pairs of two-rib roasts can be obtained from one carcass, the pairs 
consisting of ribs 11 and 12, 9 and 10, and 7 and 8. These pairs can be used 
to compare the cooking losses, the exterior and interior color, the juiciness, 
tenderness, and flavor of roasts cooked at various temperatures. See the 
following suggestions. Cook the roasts to the same interior temperature, 63°C. 
(If desired either 55°C. or 75°C. may be used.) 

1. a. Use a constant oven temperature of 125°C. for cooking one roast of 
the pair. 

b. Cook the other roast at a constant temperature of 225°C. 

2. Compare the effect of constant oven temperatures of 125°C. and 175°C. 

3. Repeat (2) but compare 125°C. and 150°C. I 

4. Repeat (2) but compare 150°C. and 175°C. 



LAMB, PORK, AND VEAL ROASTS 257 

5. Repeat (2) but compare 150°C. and 225°C. 

6. Use the experimental searing method (20 minutes at 250°-275°C., then 
transfer the roast to a second oven at 125°C.) with a constant temperature 
of 125°C. 

7. Repeat (6) but compare the searing method and a constant temperature 
of 150°C. 

The lower searing temperature may be substituted for the experimental 
searing method in any of the above suggestions. In addition the experimental 
searing method may be used with temperatures of 150°C. and 175°C. to com- 
plete the cooking. 

If rolled instead of standing rib roasts are used, they should be placed on 
racks to keep them above the drippings. Compute losses and make records as 
suggested under Experiment 39. 

What is the interior temperature of a roast which is rare? Of a medium 
well-done roast? Of a well-done roast? In each case what was the number of 
minutes per pound required for roasting? What is the effect of increasing the 
size of the roast on the time required per pound? How much did the inner 
temperature of roasts rise after removal from the oven? What factors cause 
variations in this rise in temperature? If a rare roast is to be served immedi- 
ately, at what temperature would you remove it from the oven? Is the rate of 
increase of inner temperature of the different roasts constant? 

Lamb, Pork, and Veal Roasts 

Experiment 42. 

To determine the effect on roasts of cooking at different temperatures. 

Use roasts of lamb, pork, and veal, but if possible the roasts should be 
paired; that is, use the same cuts from the right and left sides of the same 
carcass. Make tracings of cut surfaces of the roasts. Make a record of width. 
Determine the total, the dripping, and the volatile losses. Calculate the time 
of cooking per pound. Find the rise of inner temperature after removal from 
the oven. Compare the roasts for juiciness, flavor, and tenderness. Record the 
inner temperature of roasts and ovens at the same intervals used in Experi- 
ment 29 and plot on graph paper. Make records as suggested under Experi- 
ment 39. 

For all the following roasts the bulb of the thermometer should be placed 
in the center of the thickest portion of the roast, which is not necessarily the 
center of the piece of meat. If a loin roast of pork is used the thermometer 
bulb should be in the center of the large muscle along the backbone. 

A. Lamb. 

Preparation. Weigh the roast. Wipe with a damp cloth. Insert the ther- 
mometer bulb into the thickest portion of the leg. Use two rulers held at right 
angles to each other to determine the depth of inserting the thermometer bulb. 
Place the roast on a rack in a weighed, open pan so the skin side or fell side 
is down if a leg of lamb is used, and up if a shoulder roast is used. Record 
the temperature of roast and place in oven without addition of water or 
seasonings. Cook to an interior temperature of 75°C. 

1. Use the constant 150°C. oven temperature. Cook one leg of lamb with 
the fell removed but leave the fell on the other leg of this pair. 



258 MEAT 

2. For paired roasts use any of the cooking temperatures suggested under 
Experiment 41. 

B. Pork loin. 

Preparation. Weigh the roasts. Insert the thermometer in the same manner 
as for beef-rib roasts. Place the roast with fat side up on a rack in a weighed 
pan. Cook to an interior temperature of 84°C. 

Searing method. Because of the long time required to cook pork roasts, a 
temperature of 150°C. was used for the temperature of cooking in the second 
oven after searing at 250°-255°C- for 20 minutes with the experimental 
searing method. 

1. For paired roasts use any of the cooking temperatures suggested under 
Experiment 41, but use the higher cooking temperature with the experimental 
searing method. 

C. Veal. 

Preparation. Prepare in the same manner as other roasts. Place on a rack 
in an open pan. The cut used for roasting in the Cooperative Meat Investiga- 
tions is a section of the thigh about 4 inches wide cut through the femur just 
inside the end of the enlarged joint. Cook to an interior temperature of 71°C. 

1. For paired roasts use any of the cooking temperatures suggested under 
Experiment 41. 

Experiment 43. 

To determine the effect on roasts of lamb, pork, and veal of cooking to 
different stages of doneness. 

Follow the directions under Experiment 42 and cook roasts of veal, lamb, 
and pork. Cook by the constant temperature (150°C.) method and vary the 
interior temperatures to which the roasts are cooked as follows: 

Lamb: 71°, 75°-76°, and 83°C. 
Pork: 78°, 83°-84°, and 88°C. 
Veal: 71°, 75°, and 80°C. 

Steaks and Chops 

Experiment 44. 

Steaks. 

To determine the effect upon steaks of cooking by different methods and to 
different interior temperatures. 

Rib, porterhouse, sirloin, or round steak may be used. Steaks for compara- 
tive tests by the Cooperative Meat Investigators are cut 2 incRes thick. Steaks 
1 to 15<4 inches in thickness are satisfactory for class work. 

Preparation. Weigh the steak. Make a tracing of the cut surfaces. Measure 
the thickness. Insert a weighed thermometer, so that the bulb is midway, i.e., 
y2 inch from the top and from the bottom of a steak 1 inch thick. A right- 
angle thermometer should be used for steaks to be pan-broiled, but either a 
tube or right angle may be used for broiled steaks. Steaks may be turned at 
regular intervals or only once. If turned only once, Cline suggests turning 



STEAKS AND CHOPS 259 

the steak when about three-fifths of the expected temperature rise has oc- 
curred. If the temperature of the steak is 10° and it is to be cooked to an 
interior temperature of 60°, the temperature rise will be 50°, and three-fifths 
of 50 equals 30. Thus the steak will be turned when the inner temperature 
is about 40°C. To turn, stick a fork into the flank muscle, connective tissue, 
or firm fat and not into one of the principal muscles. 

Keep a record of the interior temperature of the steaks at regular intervals. 
Note and record the temperature rise after cooking is stopped. Plot on graph 
paper. Record the time for cooking and minutes seared on each side (if searing 
is used). Compute the total, the volatile, and drippings losses. 

Compare the steaks for exterior appearance, interior color, juiciness, flavor, 
and tenderness. In preparing samples for testing, be sure the scorer gets the 
same slice from each steak. 

Cook all steaks to an interior temperature of 61 °C. 

A. Method of cooking. 

1. Broiled. Weigh the broiling pan and rack. Place pan so that the top of 
the steak will be about 4 inches below the flame. A fireless cooker ther- 
mometer may be placed at the left front on the first two rods. Heat the broiler 
pan and rack until the fireless cooker thermometer registers about 175°C. 
Place steak on rods in the center of the pan with thermometer at the right- 
hand side and broil until the desired temperature for turning is reached. Turn 
so that the thermometer is still at the right-hand side. Turn the thermometer 
so the reading scale is up. Remove when the desired interior temperature is 
reached. Note temperature rise. When the maximum temperature is reached, 
weigh the steak and the broiler pan and drippings. 

For variation in temperature of broiled steaks, lower or raise the top of 
the steak farther from or nearer to the flame. 

2. Pan broil. Sear on each side in a hot skillet. Turn. Lower heat and cook 
slowly until the temperature for turning is reached. Turn and cook until the 
desired interior temperature is reached. Remove and follow directions under (1 ). 

3. Pan broil. Repeat (2) but use a constant temperature for cooking. 

B. Varying the interior temperature to which steak is cooked. 

1. Use the same method for cooking all steaks. Follow directions under A 
and cook until the interior temperature reaches rare, 55° to 57°C. 

2. Repeat (1) but cook medium well done, 61 °C. 

3. Repeat (1) but cook well done, 71 °C. 

C. Thickness of the steak. 

Cook by the same method and to the interior temperature decided upon by 
the class. Compare the cooking losses and time of cooking. 

1. Use a steak ^ inch thick. (Cannot use thermometer.) 

2. Repeat (1) but use a 1-inch thick steak. 

3. Repeat (1) but use a steak cut 1^^ inches thick. 

Chops. 

Repeat any of the above experiments using chops of pork, lamb, or veal. 
Cook pork chops to an interior temperature of 80°C., lamb to 75°C., and 
veal to 71°C. 



260 MEAT 

Less Tender Cuts 

Experiment 45. 

To determine the effect of various factors in cooking less tender cuts of 
meat. 

Braising. Cuts. Use paired cuts. Cuts from the neck, flank, rump, round, 
or particular muscles from the round such as the semitendinosus may be used. 
One piece is cut from the right, and a second piece of the same size and 
from the same position from the left side of the carcass. Pieces weighing 
about 1 to 1^ pounds are satisfactory for class work. 

Preparation. Weigh the pieces. Each member of the class cooks a pair of cuts. 
Everything, as nearly as possible, should be standardized, except the variable 
being tested. For example, if the effect of pounding is to be determined, both 
pieces may be seared but only one should be pounded. 

Add 2 grams of salt per pound of meat. Add ^ cup of liquid per pound 
and more if necessary, but keep a record of the amount added. With larger 
pieces of meat a relatively smaller proportion of liquid may be added. If 
necessary to add water, have it boiling. 

Use covered containers, of a size suitable for the pieces of meat being 
cooked, such as casseroles, Dutch ovens, skillets, etc. For some experiments 
both pieces of the pair may be cooked in the same container, one or both 
pieces being marked with a metal tag or with tooth picks. For other tests 
separate utensils will need to be used for each piece of meat. 

Determine only the total cooking losses. Compare the juiciness, flavor, 
tenderness, and slicability of the meat. 

The following suggestions are offered for tests : 

1. Pounded vs. not pounded. 

2. Floured vs. not floured (neither piece pounded). 

3. Floured vs. not floured (both pieces pounded). 

4. Seared vs. not seared (neither pounded nor floured). 

5. Seared vs. not seared (both pounded and floured). 

6. Covered vs. uncovered. 

7. Lower (simmer) vs. higher temperature (boiling over flame). 

8. Lower vs. higher temperature (in oven). 

9. Add tomato juice as liquid to one piece, an equal quantity of water to 
the other. 

10. Repeat (9) but substitute sour cream for the tomato juice. 

11. Remove one piece when the interior temperature reaches 75°C., the 
other when the inner temperature reaches 85°C. 

12. Remove one piece when the interior temperature reaches 85°C., the 
other at 95°C. 

Many combinations of the above suggestions and other combinations not 
mentioned may be tried. 

Cooking Meat in Water 

Experiment 46. 

To determine the effect of temperature of the water upon the palatabillty of 
the meat 



GROUND MEAT 261 

Stews. Use neck, heel of round, or any of the less tender cuts. The meat 
is cut into cubes of the size desired, using equal quantities from each side of 
the carcass. Cook in covered utensils. The amount of water added is usually 
just sufficient to cover the meat. This will have to be determined in connec- 
tion with the utensils used for the stew. At the start try using y2 cup of 
liquid to each pound of meat. For boiling temperatures this should be doubled. 
Use 2 grams of salt per pound of meat. For stews the meat is usually pre- 
pared in one of three ways, (a) Brown stew. The meat is seasoned and 
seared in fat before it is added to the boiling liquid. The meat may be floured 
before it is seared. The flour browns more readily and adds color to the 
liquid, (b) The meat is added directly without searing to the boiling liquid, 
(c) The meat, without being seared, is added to the cold liquid and heated 
slowly to the desired temperature. If vegetables are used with the stew, they 
are added so that they will just become tender before the stew is served. The 
broth of the stew may be thickened slightly. 

1. Brown stew. Dredge the meat with flour. Add salt. Sear in hot fat. 
Add the seared meat to the boiling water. Cook one stew at simmering 
(85°-90°C., 185°-194°F.) temperature, the other at boiling. Add boiling water 
to either as needed, but the amount of water when served should not cover 
the meat or meat and vegetables when served. 

2. Repeat (1) but add the unseared meat to the boiling water. 

3. Repeat (1) but add the unseared meat to cold water. Heat slowly to sim- 
mering and boiling temperatures. 

Compare the meat from the various stews for flavor, juiciness, slicability 
(if pieces are large enough to slice), stringiness, tenderness, and time of 
cooking. 

Broth 

Experiment 47.

Cured Meats 
Ham 

Experiment 49. 

To determine the effect of various factors affecting the palatability of ham. 

Hams may be secured with a light or a heavy salt cure. The former do not 
need to be soaked before cooking; the latter may be improved by soaking. 

Preparation. For hams with a light salt cure, scrub with a brush. Dry, then 
weigh. Insert thermometer so that the center of the bulb is at the center of 
the thickest portion of the ham, with rind or fat side up. To determine the 
depth for inserting the thermometer use two rulers at right angles to each 
other. Or with a steel skewer pierce the rind or fat side, running the skewer 
point just through the ham. Withdraw and measure the depth the skewer was 
in the ham. The thermometer is to be inserted half this distance. If the rind 
has not been removed, it will need to be cut away with scissors or a knife so 
that the thermometer can be inserted. Use hams of about the same weight for 
all the tests. 

For hams with a heavy salt cure, soak, keeping the time of soaking and the 
amount of water used standardized. Soak over night using a quart of water 
to each pound of ham. Remove from the soaking water and drain 10 minutes. 
Weigh and proceed as for non-soaked hams. 

Record the temperature of ham and oven every 10 minutes for the first 
30 minutes, then every 20 or 30 minutes. For hams from which the rind has 
not been removed, remove the rind after the ham comes from the oven. If to be 
scored hot, cut as soon as the maximum temperature is reached. If to be 
scored cold, store after removing rind. 

A. Baked ham. 

Place the ham skin side up on a rack in an open weighed pan. Add no water 
or seasoning. 

1. Bake in an oven at 125°C. (about 255°F.) until an interior temperature 
of 70°C. is reached. 

2. Repeat (1) but cook to an interior temperature of 75°C. 

3. Repeat (2) but cook to an interior temperature of 80°C.

4. Repeat (1) but have the oven temperature 150°C. (about 300°F.). 

B. Boiled ham. 

Use kettles with covers, ham boilers, or boilers of such size that the w^ater 
will cover the ham. The ham is placed on a rack, rind or fat side up. Use 
an ordinary laboratory thermometer to take the temperature of the water. 
Add 1 quart of water per pound of ham. Occasionally add water at the same 
temperature as water in w^hich ham is cooked to replace that lost by evapora- 
tion. 

1. Let simmer in water at 83°C. until an inner temperature of 75°C. is 
reached. Or, if preferred, use the interior temperature preferred with baked 
ham. Remove from the water. Drain. Weigh. Keep over night in the re- 
frigerator. 

2. Repeat ( 1 ) but let the ham cool over night in the liquor in which it was 
cooked. Let the kettle remain in the room so that the liquid will cool to room 
temperature. Remove from the liquid. Drain 10 minutes and weigh. Place in 
the refrigerator to be scored with hams from (1) and (3). 

3. Repeat (1) but put the kettle or boiler in the refrigerator over night, 
letting the ham cool in the liquor in which it was cooked. Remove from liquid. 
Drain 10 minutes, and then weigh. 

4. Repeat (1) but keep the temperature of the water at 87°C. 

5. Repeat (1) but keep the water at 78°C. 

Bacon 

Experiment 50. 

To determine the effect on the flavor and the losses of bacon by cooking 
at different temperatures and to different stages of doneness. 

Weigh the bacon before and after cooking to determine the percentage 
lost during cooking. The difference in weight of the uncooked and cooked 
bacon is the total cooking loss. The weight of the fat in the cooking utensil 
is the approximate fat loss. 

Have the bacon sliced or cut on a slicing machine 3/32 inch thick. Make a 
tracing of slices if desired. 

1. Place the slices of bacon on a rack Yz inch above the bottom of an open 
pan. Cook in an oven at 160°C. (about 320°F.) for 18 minutes. Do not turn. 

2. Place the weighed slices of bacon so that they lie flat and full length 
in a cold, heavy iron or aluminum skillet. (With a 9-inch skillet 3 slices of 
bacon will usually lie flat and full length.) Place over a slow fire and cook 
slowly until a uniform brown in color. It should be medium well done or crisp 
but not brittle. Turn the bacon frequently and in such a manner that it is 
cooked uniformly. Often the center, if the skillet is hot, of the slice of bacon 
is done while the ends are not. 

3. Place the weighed slices of bacon so that they will lie flat and full length 
in a hot, heavy iron or aluminum skillet. Cook rapidly at a high temperature 
until a uniform brown in color. Turn the bacon frequently and in such a man- 
ner that it is cooked uniformly. 

4. Repeat 2, but cook the bacon until it is very crisp and well done or brittle. 
Compare the cooking losses and flavor with 1 and 2.

CHAPTER VIII 
EMULSIONS 

Some substances like alcohol and water are miscible in all proportions, 
i.e., they mix intimately however small or large the proportions used, 
whereas other substances like oil and water are not miscible. 

When a liquid is dispersed in a second liquid with which it is non- 
miscible the product is called an emulsion. The boundary surface between 
these two non-miscible liquids is referred to as the liquid/liquid interface, 
or the dineric interface. Most emulsions are colloidal systems in which the 
dimension of the dispersed phase is greater than 0.5/x, the upper lim.it of 
the colloidal realm. However, the stabilizing film in the concentrated 
emulsions may have colloidal dimensions. 

In cookery, the liquid of the emulsion may be water, milk, a weak acetic 
acid solution, or some similar liquid. The fat or oil may be any fat or 
oil used as a food. Mineral oils may also be used for emulsions. If emul- 
sions are mentioned in connection w^ith food preparation, mayonnaise is 
usually the one suggested first. However, all thickened gravies, sauces, and 
cream soups are emulsions. Fillings for pies like chocolate cream, and 
French and cooked salad dressings, may be added to the list. In many 
of the batter products the fat or oil may be partially or wholly emulsified. 

Forming emulsions. To form emulsions, work must be done. The 
function of the work is not only to separate the dispersed phase into smaller 
particles, but to increase the surface area, which gives a better opportunity 
for the two phases to come in contact with each other and increases the 
area for adsorption of the emulsifying agent. Stirring, beating, shaking, 
grinding, or some other method may be used to disperse one of the sub- 
stances. 

Dispersed and continuous phases. The substance broken into small 
portions is called the inside, the discontinuous, or the dispersed phase; the 
one surrounding the dispersed phase is designated as the outside, the con- 
tinuous phase, or the dispersing medium. If oil and vinegar are shaken 
together, French dressing is made, but after standing a few minutes the 
oil and vinegar separate. This type of emulsion that lasts for a few minutes 
only is sometimes called a temporary emulsion. 

Emulsifiers. A permanent emulsion of pure water and pure oil can 
be formed only when the proportion of oil is very small, less than 2 per 
cent, and usually not more than 1 part of oil in 10,000 parts of water. For 
a permanent emulsion with a high percentage of fat or oil, a third sub- 
stance must be present to prevent the drops of oil or of water from 

266 



THE PHASE-VOLUME THEORY 267 

coalescing or running together. This third substance is known as an emul- 
sifying agent, an emulsifier, or a stabilizer. Its function is to form a film 
around the oil or water drops and thus keep them dispersed, giving per- 
manence to the system. 

Classes of Emulsions 

Clayton states that two very distinct classes of emulsions exist. ( 1 ) The 
very dilute emulsions. These emulsions are simple emulsions, containing 
only oil and water. In this class only the oil in water emulsions are known. 
(2) The concentrated emulsions. The more concentrated emulsions may be 
either of two types according to whether the oil or the water is the dis- 
persed phase. In the ( 1 ) oil-in-water type of emulsion the drops of oil are 
the dispersed or divided phase. In the (2) water-in-oil type of emulsion 
the water is the dispersed phase. The factors determining the type of emul- 
sion formed will be considered later. 

The Theory of Emulsification 

Bancroft states that the necessary conditions for forming a stable emul- 
sion are that the drops of the dispersed phase shall be so small that they 
will stay suspended and that there shall be a sufficiently viscous film 
around each drop to keep the drops of the dispersed phase from coalescing. 

Many theories have been advanced to account for the way or means by 
which the emulsion is stabilized by the emulsifier. At the present time 
no theory has been postulated that seems to apply universally to all emul- 
sions. As Fischer suggests, probably a number of factors play a role, and 
the relative importance of each varies not only in different emulsions but 
in one and the same emulsion under different circumstances. Clayton in 
his latest book on emulsions gives a summary of the various theories for 
emulsions. Only a few will be mentioned here. 

The electrical double layer. The oil globules in a pure oil and pure 
water emulsion carry a negative charge. The water ionizes so that both 
hydrogen and hydroxyl ions are present. The negative charge on the oil 
may come from adsorption of the OH ions. These adsorbed hydroxyl ions 
form a layer around the oil globules. A second layer of oppositely charged 
ions forms a layer in the liquid outside the layer of negative ions. These 
two layers of oppositely charged ions are known as the Helmholtz double 
layer. They are not confined to emulsions but accompany all boundary 
phenomena. The electric charge is a factor in all emulsions, even those 
stabilized with emulsifying agents. 

The phase-volume theory. If spheres of the same diameter are packed 
as closely as possible, one sphere will touch 12 others and the volume the 
spheres occupy is about 74 per cent of the total volume. Thus if the spheres 
or drops of the dispersed phase remain rigid it is possible to disperse 74 



268 EMULSIONS 

parts of the dispersed phase in the continuous phase ; but if the dispersed 
phase is increased to more than 74 parts of the total volume, a reversal 
of the emulsion will occur. However, the dispersed phase does not remain 
rigid in shape but the drops flatten out where they come in contact with 
each other, nor are all the dispersed particles the same size (see Figs. 27 
to 30), so that it is possible for the dispersed phase to consist of from 1 to 
99 per cent of the emulsion. 

Hydration theory o£ emulsions. Fischer and Hooker state that 
hydrated colloids make the best emulsifiers. Fischer states the emulsifying 
agent, by w^hich a permanent emulsion is obtained, invariably "proves to be 
a hydrophilic colloid when water and oil emulsions are concerned (a 
Ij^ophilic colloid of some sort when other than aqueous mixtures are under 
consideration). Put another way, oil cannot permanently be beaten into 
water, but only into a colloid hydrate." 

Fischer and Hooker have found albumin, casein, and gelatin to be good 
emulsifying agents. Casein when not hydrated, i.e., at its isoelectric point, 
is a poor emulsifying agent, but hydrated casein, i.e., acid or alkali casein 
is a good emulsifying agent. 

Fischer states that all permanent emulsions can be explained on the basis 
of hydrated or lyated colloids. He says that when water changes to a 
colloid hydrate, its physical constants change ; and these include, among 
others, surface tension, viscosity, and adsorption. The treatment of the 
colloid, such as freezing or heating, or the addition of substances which 
alter the water-holding capacity of the colloid may crack the emulsion or 
lessen its emulsifying ability. 

Interfacial films. Clayton in discussing "Foods as Colloid Systems" 
describes interfacial films as follows: "As early as 1840, Ascherson ob- 
served 'that coagulation in form of a membrane occurs inevitably and 
instantaneously when albumin comes into contact with a liquid fat.' — Any 
solute which lowers the interfacial tension between oil and w^ater will 
necessarily accumulate at that interface, and in the case of certain proteins, 
notably albumen, the act of adsorption leads to a change in the physical 
character of the emulsifying agent, this being 'precipitated' as a fibrous or 
membrane-fibrous solid, no longer soluble in its original solvent. The ex- 
istence of such interfacial membranes was verified by Ramsden and other 
investigators." 

In reading the various theories of emulsion one is impressed with the 
similarity of many factors. 

Oriented wedge theory. This theory for the manner in which emul- 
sions are stabilized has been developed from the work of Langmuir and of 
Harkins. It is based upon the concept that the molecules of the emulsifier 
orient themselves in the interface between the dispersed and continuous 
phases, forming a wedge, the curvature of which determines the size of the 
dispersed phase. Fuller accounts may be found in Clayton's book and in 
the articles of the authorities mentioned above. 



THE TYPE OF EMULSION FORMED 269 

Adsorbed film and interfacial tension theory. This theory has been 
developed or rather extended from earlier theories. At the present time it 
is probably the most universally accepted theory for the formation of emul- 
sions. Bancroft stated the underlying principles, basing them upon Don- 
nan's early work of interfacial tension ; but many others have extended the 
interpretations. Clayton states that with this theory "emphasis is laid upon 
the fact that emulsification is influenced by ( 1 ) the mass of the emulsi- 
fying agent present, (2) the ease with which this agent is adsorbed at the 
interfacial separating surface, and (3) the nature of the ions adsorbed by 
the resultant film." 

The emulsifier may be adsorbed by the water or by the oil, but it is 
usually adsorbed more in one liquid than in the other and thus lowers the 
interfacial tension of one liquid to a greater extent than that of the other. 
If the tension of the water is lowered more than that of the oil, the water 
has less tendency to form drops, flows to form a film more readily, and 
becomes the continuous phase. Thus the type of emulsion formed depends 
upon the nature of the emulsifying agent. The above is often worded some- 
what as follows: if the emulsifying agent is more soluble in water than in 
the oil the water becomes the continuous phase, or if the emulsifying agent 
is wetted more by the water than by the oil, the water becomes the con- 
tinuous phase. When the tension on each side of the film or the emulsifying 
agent is the same no emulsion is formed. This may occur when opposing 
emulsifying agents are in the mixture and the effect of each counterbalances 
that of the other. 

To form an emulsion the emulsifier must be adsorbed at the interfacial 
surface and form a sufficiently coherent film to stabilize the emulsion. 
The reversal of the emulsion depends upon the nature of the ions adsorbed 
by this film. Bhatnagar stresses more than previous workers the necessity 
for wetting of the adsorbed film. 

The making of permanent emulsions is important for foods, cosmetics, 
pharmaceutical preparations, sprays, and other products. But breaking of 
emulsions is important in crude oil operations for recovery of the oil. Hence 
emulsions have been investigated from many angles and it is not surprising 
that no one theory applies to all types of emulsions. 

The Type of Emulsion Formed 

The type of emulsion formed, i.e.: (1) oil-in-water or (2) water-in-oil, 
depends upon the nature of the emulsifying agent, the nature of the oil, 
and the effect of electrolytes. With one emulsifier an oil-in-water emulsion 
may be formed with a specific oil. Sometimes by the addition of the right 
substance, usually an electrolyte, the emulsion can be reversed and changed 
to a water-in-oil emulsion. Other emulsifiers with the same oil will form 
water-in-oil emulsions. 

Bancroft states that a hydrophilic colloid tends to make water the dis- 



270 EMULSIONS 

persing phase, and a hydrophobic colloid tends to make water the dis- 
persed phase. 

The potassium and sodium soaps are more soluble in water than in the 
oil and form oil-in-water emulsions. Magnesium and calcium soaps are 
more soluble in oil than in water and tend to form water-in-oil emulsions. 
Aluminum and iron soaps are more soluble in oil than the magnesium and 
calcium ones and form water-in-oil emulsions. 

Bhatnagar emphasizes the influence of the electric charge of the emulsi- 
fying agent upon the type of emulsion formed. He makes the following 
generalization. **A11 emulsifying agents having an excess of negative ions 
on them and wetted by water will yield oil-in-water emulsions, while 
those having an excess of adsorbed positive ions and wetted by oil will 
give w\iter-in-oil emulsions." 

Seifriz, in his work with petroleum oil emulsions stabilized with casein 
solution, found that the oils with a specific gravity of 0.828 or below 
form oll-In-water emulsions. When the specific gravity of the oil is greater 
than 0.857 a water-in-oil emulsion is formed, and oils with specific gravity 
between 0.828 and 0.857 give coarse, unstable emulsions or cannot be emul- 
sified at all. 

Reversal of type of emulsion. No definite rule can be given concern- 
ing the reversal of emulsions. The addition of an electrolyte In definite 
concentrations may stabilize some emulsions and bring about reversal of 
others. Reversal of some emulsions may occur upon the addition of a 
definite quantity of a hydroxide. Sometimes the addition of more of the 
hydroxide will again bring about a reversal of the emulsion into the origi- 
nal type. Shaking after standing may cause reversal of some emulsions. 

Some ions are antagonistic to each other. Thus Clowes has shown that, 
if a rancid oil is dropped from a pipette which has the end immersed 
under w^ater, drops of a certain size are formed. But if the oil Is dropped 
into a sodium chloride solution, the drops are very much smaller. This Is 
probably due to the formation of sodium soaps with the rancid oil and the 
lowering of the interfaclal tension. If the oil is dropped Into a calcium 
chloride solution the interfaclal tension is increased and very large oil 
drops are formed, owing in this case to the formation of calcium soaps. 
If both sodium and calcium are in the solution they antagonize each other 
and the result obtained will depend on the concentration of each present. 
Sodium and potassium are antagonistic to calcium and magnesium. 

Means of determining the type of emulsion. Several ways have 
been proposed to determine which of the two liquids Is the continuous 
phase. 

The drop-dilution method may be used to determine the type of emul- 
sion by the microscope. To a small portion of the emulsion placed on a 
slide add a drop of water with a pin point and stir slightly. If the water 
blends with the emulsion, it Is an oil-in-water emulsion, but if oil blends 
with the outside phase it Is a water-in-oil emulsion. 



SOME FOOD EMULSIFIERS 271 

Another method of determining the type of emulsion is to use Sudan 
III or Scharlach R, red dyes soluble in the oil but not in the water. A 
small portion of the finely powdered dye is dusted over the surface of the 
emulsion. If oil is the external phase the color gradually spreads through- 
out the emulsion. But if water is the external phase the color does not 
spread but is confined to the oil with which it comes in contact on the 
surface. 

The microscope may be used to determine the type of emulsion formed. 
If the oil is dyed red, a red field with clear globules indicates a water-in- 
oil emulsion; red globules in a clear field show an oil-in-water emulsion. 
Sometimes a multiple emulsion is obtained, i.e., a dispersed phase within a 
dispersed phase. The only means of identifying a multiple emulsion is by 
the microscope. 

Some food emulsifiers. Seifriz has reported that "olive oil stabilized 
with sodium oleate, sodium stearate, gelatose, gum arabic, albumin, lecithin, 
saponin, senegin, smilacin, or plant juices (cell sap and protoplasm) forms 
oil-in-water emulsions, while the same oil stabilized with casein, gliadin, 
cholesterin, or cephalin forms water-in-oil emulsions." Seifriz has also 
reported that with casein as the emulsifier the following oils all gave water- 
in-oil emulsions: olive, castor bean, poppy seed, sperm, and cod-liver oil. 
Linseed oil forms with casein a dual emulsion with the water-in-oil type 
predominating. Lecithin favors the formation of oil-in-water emulsions, 
whereas cholesterol favors water-in-oil emulsions. Saturated casein solu- 
tions with common food fats tend to form water-in-oil emulsions. 

In food preparation, various fats and oils are used in the formation of 
emulsions. Oils commonly employed are cottonseed, corn, olive, and pea- 
nut. The fats include butter, lard, Crisco, Snowdrift, and others. In a 
cake batter there are several emulsifiers: the casein of milk, egg yolk, egg 
white, and the glutenin, gliadin, and starch of the flour. When equal quan- 
tities of fat or oil and emulsifying agents were used, the types of emulsions 
formed varied, depending on the emulsifier used and whether the oil was 
added to the emulsifier, or vice versa. 

With egg yolk all the oils and fats gave a very stable emulsion of the 
oil-in-water type. With egg white as the emulsifier, oil forms an oil-in- 
water emulsion. Fig. 26 shows an emulsion of corn oil and egg white. 
When the oil is added gradually to the egg white, a foam as well as an 
emulsion is formed. The large white spheres are air bubbles. The oil is 
colored red and in the photomicrograph shows black. The illustration also 
shows that the oil is adsorbed in the film or layer at the interface between 
a liquid and a gas. 

When a given weight of butter is added gradually to an equal weight 
of egg white, an oil-in-water emulsion is formed. With the last additions 
of the butter the emulsion may break. If beating is continued, a water- 
in-oil emulsion may form. In melting butter the curdy part containing 
the casein settles to the bottom of the container and consequently is usually 



272 



EMULSIONS 



the last portion to be added to the egg white. It may have some effect 
upon the reversal of the emulsion. Sometimes onl3^ an oil-in-water emul- 
sion forms. Whether this is due to the salt or casein content of the butter 
or to the temperature maintained is not known. The emulsion obtained 
when egg white is added to the melted butter may be a water-in-oil or 
an oil-in-water. 




Fig. 26. — A coarse emulsion of oil In egg white. Egg white will not foam If a fat 
like butter or lard Is added to It, but with oil both an emulsion and a foam are 
formed when beaten with an egg beater. The large light spheres are air bubbles. 
The oil Is stained red and appears dark in the photomicrograph. This photomicro- 
graph is interesting for it shows the adsorption or concentration of the oil at the 
interface between a gas and a liquid (egg white). This adsorption of fat can be 
seen In later Illustrations of cake batter. 

Magnification approximately x 135. 

Lard and Crisco form rather unstable emulsions with egg white, but 
both types may be formed. 

With a saturated casein solution as the emulsifier, the water-in-oil type 
of emulsion predominates when butter, lard, Crisco, and oil are used. The 
emulsions are rather coarse and unstable. 

EfBciency o£ different substances as emulsifiers. Some emulsify- 
ing agents are more efficient than others. No study has been made to 
compare the efficiency of the various emulsifiers under different conditions 
and for different emulsions. As a class, the hydrophilic colloids seem to be 
the most efficient emulsifiers. Clark and Mann have reported the efficiency 
of sucrose, dextrin, starch, gum arable, and egg albumin in emulsions of 
benzene and kerosene in water. The oils composed 75 per cent of the total 



STABILIZATION BY POWDERS 273 

volume In each case. The emulsions were made by shaking In a bottle, the 
oil being added in 3 parts and a total of 4800 shakes used in making the 
emulsion. They examined the emulsions after standing 1, 4, and 7 weeks 
and ranked the emulsifiers for stability on a scale of 10. 

With benzene and a 1 per cent solution of each emulsifier the order was 
as follows: egg albumin, 10; starch, 6; gum arable, 5; dextrin, 3; sucrose, 
0. With kerosene the order was as follows: egg albumin, 10; starch, 9; 
gum arable, 3 ; dextrin, 2 ; sucrose, 2. 

Clark and Mann also determined the efficiency of the above emulsifying 
agents in the presence of electrolytes. In some cases the electrolytes in- 
creased the viscosity; in others they lowered It. They concluded that "no 
one general rule can be made as to the effect which produces the best 
emulsions for any one substance nor can any one generalization be made 
for the effect which produces the best emulsion for all substances under 
all conditions. Those which seem to be of primary importance are viscosity 
and film formation." 

Brooks reports that egg yolk is four times more efficient in mayonnaise 
than egg white. 

Types of Emulsifying Agents 

Emulsions may be stabilized by different substances. They may be classi- 
fied as follows, the basis being upon the type of emulslfier : ( 1 ) those 
stabilized by an electric charge, (2) those stabilized by colloids, and (3) 
those stabilized by powders. 

Stabilization of emulsion by an electric charge. Mineral oil emul- 
sions in which the oil is present In very small amounts belong in the group 
stabilized by an electric charge. The oil particles are negatively charged. 
Hydrophilic sols are stabilized by hydration and an electric charge. Ghosh 
and Dhar suggest that emulsions are similar to sols and that the stability, 
the separation or coagulation, and the reversal of the emulsion are markedly 
Influenced by its electric charge. 

Emulsions stabilized by colloids. So many of the emulsifiers are 
colloidal in nature that this group is the most important In food prepara- 
tion. The following are commonly used : eggs, gelatin, flour, starch, and 
milk. Gum arable, gum tragacanth, Irish moss, and other substances are 
used less frequently. Pectin is being used to some extent. Gum arable and 
gum tragacanth are used principally in cookery of diabetic foods, the Irish 
moss in puddings. 

Stabilization by powders. Finely ground particles or powders such 
as lampblack, mustard, and paprika are a third class of substances used for 
emulsifying agents. The best examples of this type of emulslfier in prepared 
foods are the French dressings. At the present time several brands are on 
the market that are fairly stable. All are deep red in color, so that the 



274 EMULSIONS 

emulsion must be partially and probably wholly stabilized with particles of 
paprika and mustard. This kind of emulsion is formed by the powder film 
around the drops of oil which keeps them from coalescing. Clayton reports 
the results of using finely divided solids as emulsifiers by Bechhold, Dede, 
and Reiner. "They found that the formation of emulsion depends upon: 
(1) the grain size of the powder. The smaller the grain the better the 
emulsion, until an optimum is reached, after which smaller grains have 
inferior emulsifying properties. (2) The quantity of powder. The more 
powder there is available the more globules there can be covered, provid- 
ing the powder is sufficiently fine." They report that zinc dust, iron 
powder, clay, Kieselguhr, and yeast made very efficient emulsifiers. 

The Making o£ Emulsions 

To make an emulsion it is necessary to break or separate the dispersed 
phase into small globules. The work for this separation can be done in 
dififerent ways. Machines of different types are used for making commercial 
emulsions. They are all designed to break the liquid into globules, either 
by a rotary motion, pressure, or by some other means. Agitation is used in 
all of these. Homogenization is used by most commercial firms for making 
mayonnaise. In making emulsions in the home, different methods are fol- 
lowed. For mayonnaise, an egg beater is often used, French dressing is often 
shaken, and gravy and sauces are made by stirring, usually with a spoon. 

Optimum degree of agitation for each emulsion. Clayton says it is 
well known that agitation can both break and make an emulsion. The 
amount of agitation required for a given emulsion depends upon the par- 
ticular emulsion being made and the kind of mixing utensil used. Clayton 
states: "It is quite reasonable to believe that for any given emulsifying 
apparatus there exists an optimum speed or degree of agitation or mixing, 
and an optimum time of mixing or running, whereby the most perfect 
emulsion can be obtained in a given system. Experiments prove this." 

Stamm has reported that the method of preparation affects the size of 
the particles of the dispersed phase. Harkins (1928) states that the "method 
used in preparing an emulsion is one of the factors determining the dis- 
tribution, but the most striking feature of the present work is that the 
shift of the number maximum is so slight with the different methods of 
stirring employed." By number maximum Harkins refers to the number 
of particles of the dispersed phase in a definite volume. Thus the ap- 
paratus, its speed, and the time used in mixing emulsions like mayonnaise, 
may or may not determine to a great extent the size of the particles formed 
and the stability of the emulsion. 

Intermittent mixing for emulsions. Clayton states that what may 
be termed the mechanics of emulsification are far from being understood 
even now. In some experiments in making different emulsions, investiga- 



DOES PEPTIZATION PLAY ROLE IN EMULSIFICATION? 275 

tors have reported that intermittent shaking is more effective than con- 
tinuous shaking or agitation. Clayton believes that shaking is an inferior 
method of making emulsions, but that continuous shaking should give 
equally as good results as the intermittent shaking, provided the emulsified 
portions are continuously removed from the mass. Intermittent agitation is 
explained as being more effective than continuous agitation, because of the 
rest periods, w^hich allow time for adsorption of the emulsifying agent. 

In making mayonnaise, the beating is often intermittent, for in stopping 
to add oil to the mixture, short rest periods occur. 

Foams and formation of emulsions. Harkins in commenting on the 
method of preparation of emulsions, states that in a number of cases the 
emulsion failed to form after stirring rapidly with a motor-driven egg 
beater for 5 minutes, which was not in accord with the usual emulsifica- 
tion in a few seconds. He found that in all these cases no foam was pro- 
duced, and that as sooxi as a foam formed, emulsification occurred in a few 
seconds. This may be a factor in the formation of some emulsions in food 
preparation. 

MAYONNAISE 

Definition by Food and Drug Administration. "Mayonnaise, may- 
onnaise dressing, mayonnaise salad dressing, is the semi-solid emulsion of 
edible vegetable oil, egg yolk, or whole egg, a vinegar, and/or lemon juice, 
with one or more of the following: salt, other seasoning commonly used 
in its preparation, sugar and/or dextrose. The finished product contains 
not less than 50 per cent of edible vegetable oil." 

Does peptization play a role in emulsification? In no theory of 
emulsification that the writer has read is peptization mentioned. Yet the 
following comments by Bancroft on peptization so vividly describe what 
happens in making mayonnaise that they are given. Bancroft, in his chap- 
ter, ''Preparation of Colloidal Solutions," states that the methods of 
making colloidal solutions may be grouped under two heads, the dispersion 
and the condensation methods. 

The making of mayonnaise, HoUandaise sauce, gravies, and other sauces 
in which an emulsion is formed comes under dispersion methods, for 
although the dispersed phase is not sufficiently small to class the product 
as a sol, the dispersed phase must be broken into many particles. Bancroft 
states that one means of dispersion is by the addition of a peptizing agent. 
He says that peptization is always due to adsorption. "If an adsorbed film 
has a low surface tension on the water side, it will tend to scrunch up and 
to peptize the solid as internal phase. If the reverse is the case, the solid 
will tend to form the external phase." If the word oil is substituted for 
solid in the foregoing quotation, an excellent picture of the formation of 
mayonnaise emulsion is obtained. For example, if one-fourth cup of oil is 



I 



276 EMULSIONS 

added to a cup or more of well-emulsified mayonnaise, the oil may be 
stirred slowly a few times with a spoon, 15 to 20, and presto, it is all 
emulsified. The stirring could not possibly break the oil into thousands of 
small particles. Hence, the function of the stirring is to increase the area 
for adsorption to occur and the squeezing effect of the adsorbed egg yolk 
breaks the oil into many spheres. For the first addition of oil in making 
mayonnaise great care must be taken, but large quantities of oil may be 
added rapidly in the last part of the process. 

Investigations on Mayonnaise and Emulsions 

Air film on the oil phase. Hall and Halstrom have reported that the 
presence of an air film on the oil phase, as it is introduced into the emul- 
sifier and forming emulsion in making mayonnaise, results in a less stable, 
inferior emulsion with lower specific gravity than in mayonnaise prepared 
with oil having no such air films. For the emulsions having air films on 
the oil, the oil was added from a buret at a definite rate, the point of the 
buret being six inches above the surface of the forming emulsion. For oil 
having no air film the buret point was lowered so that the oil was injected 
beneath the surface of the forming emulsion. They add, "Clayton pre- 
dicted that when the dispersed phase is injected into the continuous medium 
below the surface, intermittent injection would confer no advantage." 
From their results Hall and Halstrom felt that Clayton's prediction was 
a sound one. 

Water-holding capacity o£ emulsifier. Kilgore states that preserved 
yolks are available in five main conditions : frozen salted, frozen sugared, 
fresh refrigerated, especially treated, and dried. This is also the order of 
their volume consumption by the mayonnaise trade. Kilgore emphasizes 
that the starting mixture to which the oil is added should not contain too 
much *'free" water. It should have enough **free" moisture to start emulsi- 
fication yet have a heavy body, like a thick paste, smooth in texture. Frozen 
and treated yolks, because they have more bound and less '"free" water than 
fresh yolks, are excellent for starting mayonnaise to secure a fine "grain." 
Yet more of the frozen than of fresh yolks are necessary for an emulsion of 
good consistency. Kilgore adds that de-fatted mustard flour is an excellent 
water-holding ingredient ; hence it gives a heavy paste and also has decided 
emulsifying powers. 

Emulsifying properties of mustard. Kilgore determined the emulsi- 
fying properties of mustard in three ways: (1) Foaming ability, (2) the 
stability of oil drops on a mustard solution, and (3) the stability of emul- 
sions made with mustard solution as the sole emulsifying agent. In a 75- 
pound batch of mayonnaise about 8 to 9 pounds of vinegar and 5 to 6 
ounces of mustard are used, which gives about 3.5 per cent concentration 
of mustard. The concentrations of mustards used were: 0.1, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, 
and 4.0 per cent. 



THE METHOD OF MIXING 277 

Foaming. The mustard was weighed and added to water in glass- 
stoppered bottles and shaken. Little foam was formed except with the 2 
and 4 per cent concentrations. Good emulsifiers for oil-in-water emulsions 
usually foam readily in water. 

Oil drops on mustard solution. The mustard solutions were obtained by 
adding the mustard to water and filtering ofif the residues of undissolved 
mustard. About 70 per cent of the mustard was found to be soluble. If 
drops of oil such as corn oil are poured on water, they spread in a film 
over the surface of the water. But when drops of oil are placed on water 
containing an emulsifying agent which favors the formation of an oil-in- 
water emulsion, spreading does not occur. The drops remain separate and 
distinct. Kilgore found that a 1 per cent mustard solution afforded protec- 
tion for the oil drops but a 4 per cent solution gave much greater protection. 

Stability of mustard emulsions. The corn oil was added slowly to the 
mustard solution as in making mayonnaise, a high-speed drink mixer being 
used as a whip. After being stored for one year the emulsions made with 
0.1, 0.5, and 1.0 per cent of mustard were broken. Those with 2.0 per cent 
had some oil on top ; and the emulsion with 4.0 per cent mustard did not 
break and showed no leakage of oil, although it contained 80 per cent 
of oil. 

Corran formed a water-in-oil emulsion of olive oil and lime water. To 
this emulsion mustard was added. When the concentration of mustard 
reached 2 per cent, the emulsion broke and reformed as an oil-in-water 
emulsion. Fine mustard flour was more efficient than coarse mustard flour. 

Kilgore in continuing his work with mustard and emulsification found 
that mayonnaise without mustard had a stififer consistency than that with 
a de-fatted mustard flour. But he found this depended on how the mustard 
was added. If added dry it decreased initial stiffness, but if added wet it 
increased the stiffness. De-fatted yellow mustard flour lost its emulsifying 
properties if mixed with vinegar and allowed to stand longer than a day; 
whereas this was not the case with mustard having a high oil content. 

Emulsifying properties of oils. Meszaros states the size of the fat 
drops in an emulsion depends more on the method of preparation than on 
the properties of the fat. Meszaros has expressed the emulsification capacity 
in a number {E number) which represents the milligrams of fat which 
can be emulsified under certain conditions in 100 grams of water without 
the aid of emulsifying agents. Fats tested fall in four groups: (1) Fats 
which show a very good emulsification capacity {E number over 50) ; as 
goose fat, horse fat, lard, crude rapeseed oil (crude sunflower oil). (2) Good 
emulsifying fats {E number 20-50), as butter, butter fat, peanut oil, 
sesame oil. (3) Poor emulsifying fats {E number about 10) — coconut oil, 
palm-kernel oil, soybean oil, beef tallow. (4) Very poor emulsifying fats 
{E number 10) — illipe fat, hardened train oil. 

The method of mixing. Kilgore, Corran, and Hall and Halstrom 



278 



EMULSIONS 



emphasize the method of adding the oil to secure a stable emulsion of 
desirable consistency. Hall and Halstrom found that the method they 
called the Compromise Method was the best. For this method a portion of 
the oil was added by means of a buret above or beneath the surface of the 
forming emulsion until optimum dispersion was obtained. They state that 
optimum dispersion might properly be considered the critical dispersion 
point. At this point maximum thickness is attained and any further addi- 
tion of oil results in an irrecoverable breaking of the emulsion. This oc- 
curred after the addition of 30 to 35 cc. of oil to 20 grams of beaten egg 
yolk. At this point the vinegar and spices are added. This thins the 
emulsion but thickening occurs again w^ith the addition of the remainder 
of the oil. The amount of oil added was such that the mayonnaise con- 
tained 89 to 93 per cent of oil. 

For the method which Hall and Halstrom called American, the vinegar 
and spices were added to the egg yolk. After blending of these ingredients 
the oil was added in the same manner as for the compromise method. 
Their results follow :

The emulsifying constituent of egg yolk. In starting their investi- 
gation, Snell, Olsen, and Kremers added lecithin to egg yolk in making 
mayonnaise. They acted under the general assumption that lecithin is the 
constituent of egg yolk which is effective in producing emulsions. Hence 
it was thought that the addition of more lecithin should increase the 
stability of the mayonnaise. But all the mayonnaises so produced had poor 
consistency. Next they studied the effect of each of the known major con- 
stituents of egg yolk on mayonnaise. It was found that none of these sub- 
stances was capable of producing the consistency derived from the whole 
egg yolk. 

This led to the Investigation which demonstrated that egg yolk owes 
its emulsifying action to an unstable complex containing both lecithin and 
protein, which they called "lecitho-protein." This lecitho-protein consti- 
tuted about 32.5 per cent of the salted yolks. 



THE METHOD OF MIXING 279 



Factors Affecting the Ease o£ Formation and ^~==~ 
Stability of Mayonnaise 

In making mayonnaise, several factors affect the formation of the emul- 
sion, its stability, and ease of making. The major factors may be listed as 
follows: (1) degree and kind of agitation, (2) the method of mixing, 
(3) the ingredients used, and (4) temperature. Some of these may be 
further subdivided. 

Degree and kind of agitation. This factor has already been partially 
discussed. Under it can be included the kind of apparatus used as well as 
rate of agitation. Good stable mayonnaises may be formed by both con- 
tinuous and intermittent agitation. Hall and Halstrom have demonstrated 
that very stable concentrated mayonnaise may be formed by continuous 
agitation if the oil is added beneath the surface of the forming emulsion. 
Clayton states that it is a well-known fact that agitation can both make 
and break an emulsion. It has often been observed in the laboratory, when 
the vinegar and seasoning have been added to the egg yolk before any oil 
is added, that rapid agitation for the first additions of oil is advantageous; 
otherwise the resulting mayonnaise is less viscous. 

The kind of bowl used. Some failures in making mayonnaise are due 
to putting small quantities of the egg yolk in a large mixing bowl. As a 
result the egg yolk spreads out in such a thin layer that the egg beater 
picks up very little of the egg and an emulsion is not formed with the first 
portions of the oil added. Sometimes the rod at the bottom of the rotary 
egg beater is thick and holds the beater above the contents of the bowl, 
provided the quantity of material in the bowl is small and the egg beater 
is held upright. 

The method of mixing. Under the method of mixing may be grouped 
the following: (1) the method of adding the oil, (2) the quantity of oil 
that is added at first, (3) the time of adding the vinegar, and (4) the time 
the seasonings are added. 

The method of adding the oil. Hall and Halstrom have shown that a 
more stable emulsion is formed when the oil is added beneath the surface 
of the forming emulsion. 

The quantity of oil that is added at first. Often the statement is seen 
that mayonnaise can be made by putting all the ingredients in the mixing 
bowl and then beating. The author (see Experiment 52C,3) has never 
been able to do this and has never witnessed the making of it in this way. 
Many water-and-oil emulsions can be made by putting all the ingredients 
together and shaking or stirring, but mayonnaise does not seem to belong 
to this group. It is possible that some factors may occasionally influence 
the formation of an emulsion so that it is formed when all the ingredients 
are added at once to make mayonnaise. 

Mark expresses the amount of oil that can be added and an emulsion 



280 EMULSIONS 

obtained as follows: "(1) If the proportion of oil to that of egg or of the 
emulsion already produced was kept below a certain maximum a stable 
emulsion always resulted, no matter what the temperature or manner of 
beating, (2) that if the proportion of oil added exceeded a certain maxi- 
mum, the egg or the emulsion already formed became dispersed in oil and 
no permanent emulsion was formed, (3) that if the proportion between 
these limits were used a permanent emulsion might or might not be formed, 
dependent on such variables as manner of beating and temperature, (4) that 
if egg was previously diluted by adding vinegar the proportion of oil 
which could be permanently emulsified was greatly increased during the 
addition of the first and second portions of oil, but that as viscosity of the 
mixture increased the maximum ratio of oil to emulsion rapidly approached 
the value found when egg alone was used at first." 

Mayonnaise is formed more readily if the quantity of oil added at first 
is small. But the quantity of oil that can be added to egg yolk for the first 
addition of oil and still obtain a stable emulsion depends somewhat upon 
the rate of agitation, the combined volume of egg yolk and vinegar, the 
temperature of the ingredients, and other factors. If the above factors are 
standardized and if the combined volume of the vinegar and the egg yolk 
is y!\ cup, the quantity of oil that can be added and emulsified is a definite 
quantity. If the combined egg yolk and vinegar is ^ cup, the quantity of 
oil that can be added will be 2 times as much as for ^ cup under the same 
conditions. Using 1 egg yolk and 15 cc. of vinegar and beating with a 
rotary egg beater in a round-bottomed jar, Experiment 52C, 2, 12 tea- 
spoons of oil have been the limit for the first addition of oil. Often only 
10 or 11 teaspoons can be added. This large quantity of oil must be care- 
fully emulsified before the second portion of oil is added. The volume of 
the egg yolk and vinegar is a little over 2 tablespoons. Thus the volume 
of oil that can be added, 7 to 10 teaspoons, is about the same as the 
volume of the egg yolk plus the vinegar. The emulsion is formed more 
easily if smaller quantities, 2 to 3 teaspoons, of oil are added at first. The 
second addition of oil, and any subsequent addition, must not exceed a 
definite relation to the volume of emulsion already formed. In making 
salad dressing with 1 egg, 1 cup of cornstarch paste, a cup of oil, and 
vinegar, all the oil can be added at first, but here again the volume of the 
oil is about the same as that of the emulsifier, i.e., the egg yolk plus the 
cornstarch paste. 

The time o£ adding the vinegar. Part or all of the vinegar may be 
added at various intervals during the mixing or it may be added to the egg 
yolk alternately with the oil. It may be added after considerable oil is 
added to the egg yolk (Experiment 52A,1,2,3) or before any oil is added. 
By the last method the oil may be added in larger quantities for the first 
and second additions, and the mayonnaise made more rapidly. How^ever, 
the size of the oil particles that are first emulsified is quite large when the 
vinegar is added to the egg yolk before the oil is added. But with each 



THE INGREDIENTS USED 281 

subsequent addition of oil the dispersed particles become smaller, and the 
mayonnaise stiffer. This is shown in Figs. 27 to 30, which are photo- 
micrographs of mayonnaise. If the oil is added to the egg yolk before the 
vinegar, the first oil particles emulsified are very small and remain small 
with subsequent additions of oil. When the vinegar is added, the dispersed 
globules become larger, and the mayonnaise less stiff. 

Kilgore suggests the following method. The salt, mustard, and other dry 
seasonings are added at first to fresh egg yolks, for they aid in holding the 
excess moisture. To this is added just enough vinegar to make a heavy 
paste. Then run in the oil until half is added, add another portion of 
vinegar, equal to that at the start, and the remainder at the end of the 
batch. 

Corran suggests that the emulsification be carried out in three stages. 
( 1 ) The dry ingredients, egg yolk, and part of the aqueous ingredients 
are mixed thoroughly. (2) All the oil is added, forming a creamy nucleus. 
(3) The creamy nucleus is diluted with the remainder of the aqueous 
ingredients. 

The ingredients used. These include the oil, the salt and seasonings, 
the vinegar, the egg yolks, and even previously emulsified mayonnaise. 
Any of the edible oils may be used in mayonnaise. 

Salt and seasonings. Salt, mustard, paprika, and pepper are usually 
added to mayonnaise. Small amounts of other seasonings may be used. 
Pasteurized spice mixtures are also now available to the mayonnaise manu- 
facturer. The addition of an electrolyte to an emulsion may produce 
different results, depending upon the electrolyte, the emulsifier, and the 
type of emulsion. Some electrolytes cause reversal of certain emulsions; 
others may tend to stabilize the emulsion. Seifriz in his work with emul- 
sions stabilized with casein found that sodium chloride had no influence 
on the water-in-oil emulsions, but tended to stabilize oil-in-water emul- 
sions. The effect of sodium chloride would probably vary with the emul- 
sifier and the concentration of the salt. Krantz and Gordon found that 
the concentration of the sodium chloride affected the stability of some 
emulsions. In mayonnaise, when egg yolk is used as the emulsifier and 
with the proportion of salt given in Experiment 52, it has been found that 
the addition of the salt to the egg yolk before the addition of any oil tends 
to stabilize the emulsion. In these experiments the vinegar was also added 
to the egg yolk before the oil was added. When the salt is added to the 
mayonnaise after the oil has been added, the size of the dispersed oil 
globules is larger and the emulsion breaks more readily while it is being 
made, indicating a lessened stability. The amount of salt used in the recipe 
may tend to lessen the solubility of the egg proteins sufficiently so that a 
more tenacious film is formed. If the concentration of the salt is great 
enough to "salt out" the egg proteins, then different results would be 
obtained. Thus it seems preferable to add the salt to the egg yolk and 
vinegar before adding the oil in making mayonnaise. Calcium salts, since

284 EMULSIONS 

they tend to form water-in-oil emulsions, are detrimental to mayonnaise. 
Hence it is recommended that the salt used should contain less than 0.1 per 
cent of foreign calcium salts. Kilgore's results indicate it is preferable to 
add the mustard to at least part of the vinegar to make a paste. This is 
then added to the egg yolk. 

Egg yolks. Johnson and Mark have reported that cold-storage eggs are 
inferior to fresh eggs for making mayonnaise. 

However, frozen yolks, either salted or sugared, are more extensively 
used at the present time than fresh yolks. Kilgore states the fresh yolk is 
usually too light in body to produce a good emulsion at the start. This is 
true in spite of the fact that fresh yolk is the best possible emulsifier and 
that less can be used than is required for frozen yolk. The freezing 
changes the physical consistency of the yolk. Upon defrosting the frozen 
yolks are very thick and paste like, owing to the binding of the water 
during freezing. 

The addition of a small amount of einulsified mayonnaise. Mayonnaise 
is very easily made if from ^ to 1/3 cup of previously made mayonnaise is 
added to the egg yolk and vinegar. This gives a larger quantity of mate- 
rial to work wnth, but if an emulsion is already started the emulsification 
of additional oil is accomplished more readily. After an emulsion is once 
formed, subsequent additions of oil are very easily emulsified. This is 
analogous to seeding in crystal formation and the addition of an old gel 
to gelatin to hasten jelly formation. Egg yolk is itself an emulsion con- 
taining about 30 per cent of fat. 

Kilgore states, ''another solution to the problem of producing high con- 
sistency mayonnaise having medium or low yolk content, is to start the 
emulsion by means of some finished mayonnaise added to the yolk and 
spices. This trick of starting an emulsion, or 'seeding' it, by means of one 
previously made is common in pharmaceuticals. It is the fundamental prin- 
ciple of a process for continuous emulsification." 

Temperature. Clayton states that, in general, the effect of rise In tem- 
perature Is to make emulsification easier. The reason for this is that 
viscosity Is reduced with a rise in temperature, but more important, a rise 
In temperature Is accompanied by a decrease in the interfacial tension of 
non-miscible liquids. Branch states that In commercial production of may- 
onnaise the temperature of the mixing room is kept at 65° to 75 °F. 

Breaking Mayonnaise 

Water may separate at the bottom of a mayonnaise after long standing. 
Robinson states that this seldom occurs if the amount of water in the mayon- 
naise does not exceed 15 per cent. With the percentage of water higher 
than 15 the separation occurs more frequently. 

Oil may separate at the top of the mayonnaise. Anything that destroys 
the film-forming properties of the emulsifying agent and lets the dispersed 



CONCENTRATION OF OIL IN MAYONNAISE 285 

phase run together destroys the emulsion. Over-heating, when the oil and 
liquid expand at different rates, the additions of salts, drying of the sur- 
face, freezing, and jarring may all cause separation in mayonnaise. The 
addition of enough salt (sodium chloride) to "salt out" the emulsifier 
will break emulsions stabilized with proteins, but this requires far more 
salt than is ordinarily used in mayonnaise. The amount commonly used 
aids in stabilizing the mayonnaise. 

Freezing dehydrates the egg, because the water separates from the egg 
protein in ice crystals, thus breaking the film. Agitation or shaking in 
shipping tends to break the emulsion. Evaporation from the surface of the 
mayonnaise may cause drying of the emulsifying agent and consequently 
coalescing of the oil on the surface. Mayonnaise keeps better in covered 
containers which prevent evaporation. Fischer and Hooker state that, if 
the protein emulsifier is diluted beyond the point at which it will take up 
all the water, the emulsion tends to break. Heating, resulting in too much 
evaporation of the liquid, causes separation of the fat in gravies, sauces, and 
cream pui¥s. 

Re-forming broken mayonnaise. The usual procedure to re-form 
broken mayonnaise is to take a new egg yolk and add the curdled, broken 
mayonnaise to this gradually. It is added and beaten in the same manner 
as when the oil is originally added to the egg yolk. But it is not necessary 
to use egg yolk to re-form the emulsion. It can be re-formed by adding 
the broken emulsion gradually to a tablespoon of water or vinegar. The 
broken emulsion must be added gradually to the water or vinegar and 
beaten during the addition. It will not re-form if the water or vinegar is 
added to the mass of broken emulsion. See Experiment 52, D. 

The Concentration of Oil in Mayonnaise 

The amount of oil that can be permanently emulsified varies with the 
emulsifier, the oil used, and the manner in which it is added. Pickering 
has emulsified "99 per cent of paraffin oil in 1 cc. of 1 per cent potash solu- 
tion by successive addition of small portions." The concentration of oil in 
food emulsions varies from a very low percentage up to about 85 per cent. 

Mayonnaise containing slightly more than 95 per cent of oil has been 
made in the laboratory, but it usually breaks shortly after a little more 
than 90 per cent of oil has been added. The stiffening of mayonnaise 
containing over 90 per cent of oil makes it difficult to mix the last addition 
of oil. Mayonnaise with more than 90 per cent of oil resembles jelly in 
consistency; cut with a knife or spoon it retains its shape. It will keep 
varying lengths of time in a covered jar in the refrigerator. Some break in 
a short time, but most of them keep for several days or weeks. Probably 
this variation in breaking is partially due to variations in beating in form- 
ing emulsions. After standing a short time, if the dressing is cut or if some 
is lifted out of the jar, there is a tendency for oil drops to form gradually

on the cut surface. It separates more readily than mayonnaise with a 
lower percentage of oil. Ordinary mayonnaise containing from ^ to ^ 
cup of oil to- 1 egg yolk, and 15 cc. of vinegar averages from 65 to 75 
per cent of oil. Hall and Halstrom, by introducing the oil beneath the 
surface of the forming emulsion, obtained mayonnaise with a concentration 
of 89 to 93 per cent of oil that remained stable for two years when stored 
at 8°C. 

Some Food Emulsions 

Salad dressing. The Food and Drug Administration has defined 
mayonnaise as being made with either egg yolk or whole egg. Hence, a 
product which may be similar to mayonnaise but stabilized with egg white, 
or part egg yolk and part starch paste, is called a salad dressing. Home- 
makers have used many emulsifying agents such as egg yolk, whole egg, 
egg white, cooked egg yolk, gelatin, starch paste, meat extract, and mashed 
potato. However, they are not equally efficient. The order for efficiency 
is as follows : egg yolk, whole egg, egg white, gelatin, and starch paste. 

Fats such as butter and lard may be melted and substituted in a mayon- 
naise formula, but the product is a salad dressing. Mineral oil may also be 
used in a mayonnaise formula. Boiled salad dressings are also emulsions. 

French dressings. French dressings are usually temporary emulsions, 
but some are quite stable. There, seems to be less separation of oil at the 
top and of water at the bottom, if the phase-volume rule is observed, and 
the oil composes about 74 per cent of the emulsion.. The seasonings, pow- 
dered paprika and mustard, are the emulsifiers. It is possible that traces 
of some substances in the vinegar may occasionally aid emulsification. 

Emulsions stabilized with flour. In gravies and sauces the amount of 
oil that can be permanently emulsified is much smaller than in maj'onnaise. 
Gravies and sauces in which the oil separates may be made smooth again 
by adding water and stirring while heating. The addition of water lessens 
the percentage of oil in the product. Emulsions stabilized with flour or 
starch need a higher percentage of water than mayonnaise. The starch 
absorbs a large portion of the liquid, which accounts for a large part of 
the water, but even if the maximum absorptive power of the starch is 
accounted for a large amount of water is still needed. This type of emul- 
sion belongs in the class of hydrated colloids referred to by Fischer and 
Hooker, in which they state that the water must not be reduced below 
a lower limit and must not exceed an upper limit. 

Cream puffs. Cream puffs are good examples of a batter in which the 
fat is emulsified. See Chapter XII, Experiment 80. In the recipe as given 
in the experiment, the fat constitutes about 17 per cent of the uncooked 
ingredients, if the fat content of the butter is used as 85, the eggs as 10.5, 
and the flour as 1.5 per cent. The cooking of the water, flour, and fat will 
increase this percentage, as will the baking, on account of evaporation of 



REFERENCES 287 

water. The fat does not run or ooze out of the dough while the puffs are 
baking. 

If the eggs in the recipe are reduced to 2 but no other change is made, 
Experiment 80C,2, the percentage of fat in uncooked materials is about 
18.6. The fat in these puffs runs out of the dough and over the baking pan 
in large quantities while baking. With the smaller quantity of egg the emul- 
sion does not hold, but if the amount of water added is increased to 1^ 
cups when the eggs are reduced to 2, the amount of fat in the uncooked 
ingredients is about 17 per cent. The fat in these puffs does not ooze 
out while they are baking. Although the quantity of egg is important, this 
also shows that it is essential to have a definite proportion of liquid to 
prevent breaking of the emulsion. 

Cakes. The fat in a cake batter may or may not be emulsified. A micro- 
scopic study of cake batters shows that there is a tendency for oils to be 
emulsified as oil-in-water emulsions, no matter what the method of mixing. 
Often the oil is not wholly emulsified, the degree of emulsification varying 
with the extent of mixing, the temperature, and other factors. When butter 
or hard fats are used in cakes or batter products, they may be partially or 
wholly emulsified, if they are melted before adding to the batter and pro- 
vided the temperature of the batter is not so low as to chill the fat quickly ; 
or they may be emulsified if the temperature of the ingredients is above the 
melting point of the fat, so that the fat is melted. In ordinary methods 
and temperatures of mixing cakes, the butter and hard fats do not give 
oil-in-water emulsions.

In studying emulsions, a microscope is a great aid. For very fine emulsions 
a small portion is placed on a slide and covered with a cover glass. With coarse 
and unstable emulsions it is better not to use a cover glass for the weight of 
the cover glass often breaks the emulsion. If the oil or fat is colored a dark 
red with Scarlet R, the type of emulsion formed can be determined with the 
microscope. An oil-in-water emulsion has a red oil dispersed in small spheres; 
a water-in-oil emulsion has a red field and light-colored spheres. To color the 
oil or fat, add the powdered Scarlet R and then stir. It should stand over 
night to dissolve the dye thoroughly. 

Store the emulsions in jelly glasses. Label, then cover the glasses to prevent 
evaporation. Put away in the refrigerator to determine the permanency of 
the emulsion. 

A. To determine the effect of varying the method of combining the in- 
gredients in making mayonnaise. 

1. Put the egg yolk into a small bowl, add the seasonings and the vinegar, 
and beat with a rotary egg beater. It may be necessary to tilt the bowl or egg 
beater at first, in order that the egg beater blades may come in contact with 
the small amount of material. Add the oil in small quantities at first, about j^ 
teaspoon, then in larger quantities as the emulsion is formed. 

2. Mix the egg yolk and seasoning. Follow directions under Al, for beating. 
Add about ^ teaspoon of oil. Beat, then add y^ teaspoon of vinegar. Beat. 
Continue adding oil and vinegar alternately. After all the vinegar is added, 
add the oil in larger quantities. 

3. Beat the egg yolk. Follow directions under Al, for beating. Add the 
oil a few drops at a time. After the emulsion is forming add the oil in 
larger quantities. Add the vinegar slowly after the oil is added. Add the 
seasoning last.

B. To determine the effect of the temperature of the ingredients in making 
mayonnaise. 

1. Add the vinegar and seasoning to the egg yolk. Beat. Chill in the re- 
frigerator, then set mixing bowl in ice, and add chilled oil slowly. Follow 
directions under Al, for adding the oil. 

2. Heat the oil and vinegar to 100°C. Combine as in Al. 

C. To see how much oil can be added for the first addition to 1 egg yolk 
and 15 cc, of vinegar and obtain an emulsion. 

1. Repeat Al, but add 6 or 7 teaspoons of oil at first, then beat and emulsify 
before more oil is added. Add the same amount of oil for the second portion; 
then increase the amount for the following additions of oil. 

2. If 7 teaspoons of oil can be added under CI, repeat with 8 teaspoons. 
Repeat CI, adding 9 or 10 teaspoons of oil. Increase the quantity of oil for 
the first addition as long as an emulsion is obtained. 

3. Put all the ingredients in the mixing bowl together. Then beat with a 
rotary egg beater. After beating a few seconds, let the mixture stand; then 
beat again. Is an emulsion obtained? 

D. To determine the amount of oil that can be added to mayonnaise with- 
out breaking the emulsion. 

1. Follow directions under Al, but add all the oil possible to the mayon- 
naise. Keep a record of the amount of oil added. Compare the consistency of 
the mayonnaise with that obtained in other experiments. Determine its keeping 
qualities. 

2. Repeat Dl, but add oil until the emulsion breaks. If oil has been added 
until the emulsion breaks under Dl, use it for this experiment and repeat 
D2, but do not add quite so much oil. Put a small portion of the broken 
emulsion, about a tablespoon, in a jelly glass. Label and cover. Divide the 
remaining broken mass into three parts. 

a. Add part one to an egg yolk gradually, beating with the egg beater 
during the process. What happens? 

b. Repeat D2,a, but add the second portion of curdled emulsion gradually 
to a tablespoon of water or vinegar. 

c. Add a tablespoon of water or vinegar to the third portion of broken 
emulsion. Beat. What happens? 

E. To determine the kinds of fat that may be used in mayonnaise. 

1. Repeat Al, but substitute butter for the oil. Melt the butter over hot 
water and keep warm while adding to the egg yolk and seasonings. 

2. Repeat El, but use lard, Crisco, or Snowdrift. 

F. To determine the effect of substituting other emulsifying agents for the 
egg yolk in making salad dressing. 

1. Substitute \y'2 tablespoons of cornstarch paste for the egg yolk in the 
mayonnaise recipe. (Make the paste by cooking XYi tablespoons of cornstarch 
with 1 cup of water.) When the paste is cool but not firm, add the season- 
ings and vinegar to 1^ tablespoons of the paste and beat with rotary egg 
beater. Add the oil slowly at first, then more rapidly after the emulsion begins 
to form. 

2. Substitute 1^ tablespoons of gelatin for the egg yolk in the mayonnaise 
recipe. (Make gelatin solution by using 3 teaspoons of gelatin to 1 cup of 
water.) When the gelatin is thick but not firm put 1^^ tablespoons in a mixing 



EMULSIONS 291 

bowl. Add the seasonings, and the vinegar. Beat. Add the oil slowly at first, 
then more rapidly. 

3. Substitute 18 grams of egg white for the egg yolk. 

4. Substitute 18 grams of whole egg for the egg yolk. 

Is there much difference in the method of combining ingredients for mayon- 
naise when egg yolk is used as the emulsifying agent? What effect does the 
temperature of the ingredients have on the formation of an emulsion? Did you 
succeed in obtaining an emulsion when the oil and all the other ingredients 
were combined in a bowl before beating? What is the largest quantity of oil 
used for the first addition of oil and a permanent emulsion obtained? How 
much oil did you succeed in adding to the mayonnaise? By examining the 
emulsions obtained under the microscope, compare cornstarch paste, gelatin, 
egg white, and egg yolk as emulsifying agents for emulsions. 

Experiment 53. 

To determine the type of emulsion formed with different emulsifying agents 
and oils or fats. 

Use oil or fat stained with Scarlet R. Continue beating the mixture for a 
few seconds after all the fat or oil is added, even if at first it appears that 
an emulsion will not form. Examine portions of different steps under the 
microscope. 

1. Use a deep, narrow bowl and a rotary egg beater. Add 25 grams of 
melted butter gradually to 25 grams of egg white. 

2. Add 25 grams of melted butter gradually to 25 grams of casein solution. 
Make the casein solution by adding some powdered casein to water and stir 
to dissolve as much as possible. After it settles use the clear liquid. The experi- 
ment may be repeated using milk. 

3. Repeat 52,1, but use oil instead of butter. 

4. Repeat 52,1, but use lard, Crisco, or Snowdrift instead of butter. 

5. Repeat 52,2, but use oil instead of butter. 

6. Repeat 52,2, but use lard or Crisco instead of butter. 

Experiment 54. 

A. To determine the proportion of oil and liquid that separates most slowly 
in French dressing. 

Mustard ^4. teaspoon about 0.8 gram 

Paprika l4 teaspoon 1 gram 

Salt ]4. teaspoon 2 grams 

Powdered sugar 1 teaspoon 

Add the seasoning to the vinegar and mix. Use a rotary t^%, beater or a 
mayonnaise mixer. A 100-cc. graduate is excellent to weigh the oil in. The 
duplicate portions with lemon juice can be measured by filling to the same 
height in the graduate. The oil is easily poured from the graduate. Add the 
oil gradually to the vinegar and seasonings. A duplicate series may be made 
and the ingredients shaken in a flask. 

1. Use 15 grams of vinegar and 82 grams of oil. 

2. Use 20 grams of vinegar and 77 grams of oil. 

3. Use 25 grams of vinegar and 72 grams of oil.

CHAPTER IX 
MILK AND CHEESE 

In food preparation, milk is used in many ways and combined with many 
kinds of foods. All the different types of cheese are made from it. Meat, 
vegetables, and cereals may be cooked in it. It is used as a basis for many 
sauces. Such sauces may be combined with eggs, with meats, or with 
vegetables; it is used in puddings and in frozen desserts; it is used for 
soups and for drinks like cocoa and coffee; it is combined with cereals; 
it is used in combination with many foods, as in custards, in cakes, and 
in quick breads. 

Milk from different animals is used for food, but in this country unless 
the source of the milk is mentioned it is understood to be cow's milk. 

Composition of Milk 

Milk from different animals varies somewhat in the proportion of the 
different constituents. All milk contains a high proportion of water, cow's 
milk averaging about 87 per cent. The milk from different breeds of cattle 
varies considerably in composition. The milk of individual cows of the 
same breed also varies in the proportion of the different constituents. This 
may be partly due to environment, partly to inheritance, and partly to 
individuality. Milk may vary particularly in fat content from one milking 
to the next. The percentage of fat increases during the milking period ; that 
is, the first milk obtained is not so rich in fat as the last portions of milk. 

The fat varies for different breeds from about 3.5 per cent for Holstein 
to about 5 per cent for Guernsey and Jersey. 

The protein varies from about 3.3 per cent for Holstein to 4.0 per cent 
for Guernsey and Jersey. It parallels the fat content somewhat, being 
highest in the breeds having a high fat content and lowest in those having 
a low fat content. 

The lactose does not vary so much with the different breeds as the fat 
and protein. The lactose content is from about 4.65 to 5 per cent. 

The ash varies from about 0.68 to 0.75 for the different breeds. 

Constituents o£ Milk 

Chemical and Physical Properties 

The constituents of milk that are most important in food preparation 
are enzymes, vitamins, pigments, salts, sugar, fat, and proteins. 

293 



294 MILK AND CHEESE 

Enzymes. The enzymes of cow's milk are reported as follows by 
Rogers; proteinases, lactase, diastase, lipase, salolase, catalase, peroxidase, 
and aldehydrase. Rogers states that the proteolytic enzyme, galactase, brings 
about slow decomposition of milk proteins into peptones, amino acids, and 
ammonia. 

Vitamins. All the vitamins recognized at the present time are contained 
in milk. Some are present in comparatively large and others in smaller 
amounts. 

Pigments. The appearance of milk is white. This is due to light rays 
reflected by the colloidally dispersed constituents of the milk, the calcium 
caseinate, and calcium phosphate. 

Milk contains two classes of yellow or orange pigments. The w^ater- 
soluble pigment, which imparts a yellow color with a green fluorescence 
to the whey of milk, was formerly called lactochrome. A name recently 
suggested for this pigment is lactoflavin. It is regarded as one flavin of a 
specific group, collectively to be called lyochromes. It is possible that lacto- 
flavin is composed of more than one pigment. Rogers says "lactoflavin 
forms compounds with saccharides, proteins, and purines (uric acid). These 
compounds possibly either occur naturally in milk or readily form during 
isolations, thus accounting for the several lactoflavins isolated from milk." 
It is probable that the pigment lactoflavin is one of the five fractions of 
vitamin G (Bo). Milk is relatively rich in this vitamin. 

A fat-soluble pigment, carotene, found in the fat gives the milk a more 
or less yellow tinge, which is more pronounced as the fat particles become 
more concentrated and form cream. The group of pigments called caroti- 
noids, which include carotene, xanthophyll, and related pigments, has been 
described in the chapter on fruits and vegetables. The chief pigment of 
butter fat is the carotene, but little xanthophyll being found. The depth of 
color depends upon the amount of pigment present. The color of carotene in 
solution varies from yellow to orange and to a deep red-orange as the 
concentration increases. The amount of carotene found in the butter fat 
depends upon the extent of carotene in the food of the cow. Green grasses, 
hay cured to retain its green color, green corn, and carrots are rich in 
carotene. The carotene content of milk fat is less rich during the winter 
months, if the food of the cow is poor in carotene during this period. Only 
in cow's milk is the fat extensively pigmented. With the exception of 
the fat of human milk, which is often pigmented, the fat of the milk of 
other animals is either devoid of or contains little pigment. 

Salts. Milk contains salts of potassium, sodium, magnesium, calcium, 
phosphates, chlorides, and citrates. Traces of sulfates and carbonates are 
found. Iron is present in small amount. Iodides are also found in small 
amounts, the amount being greater in some localities than in others. Iodides 
may be easily transmitted from the feed to the milk. Supplee and Bellis 
have found copper to average about 0.52 part per million in freshly drawn 
milk. Brickner has reported that milk contains 3.6 to 5.6 parts of zinc per 



FAT 295 

million parts of milk. Manganese in normal milk averages 0.02^ to 0.06 
parts per million. The greater part of the sulfur is found in the milk pro- 
teins. Barger and Coyne state that part of the sulfur in milk is found in 
the amino acids methionine and cystine of the proteins, but that all of the 
sulfur is not accounted for. 

The salts of milk are found in milk in solution, in the colloidal state, 
and in combination with the proteins. The exact chemical combinations 
of the different salts in the milk are not fully determined. For this reason 
different authorities report different salt combinations. Thus formulas 
imply definite combination, whereas there is a complex salt equilibrium in 
milk, which has not been satisfactorily worked out. The citrates, the com- 
binations of which may be trisodium and tripotassium citrate, tricalcium 
and trimagnesium citrate, are probably entirely in solution. The possible 
chlorides of potassium, sodium, and calcium are also in solution. Some 
authorities believe that the phosphates are present chiefly as dicalcium 
phosphate, CaHP04; others believe that tricalcium phosphate, Ca3(P04)2, 
is the principal phosphate combination. The phosphates are partly in solu- 
tion, with the greater portion in colloidal dispersion. When the particles 
of dicalcium phosphate are heated they become aggregated and partially 
precipitated. 

Calcium and magnesium are in combination with the casein to form 
calcium and magnesium caseinates. Zoller states that there may be traces 
of sodium and potassium caseinates. 

Lactose. The solubility of lactose and its properties may be found in 
the chapter on sugar. It is caramelized by heat at rather low temperatures. 

Fat. Butter fat is composed of glycerol and fatty acids. Fatty acids of 
both the saturated and unsaturated series are present. The relative per- 
centage of the unsaturated fatty acids varies with the feed, averaging 
higher in summer than in winter. Dean and Hilditch state that the oleic 
and linoleic acids increase by 4 per cent (mols), with a parallel diminution 
in butyric and stearic acids when cows return to pasture. They also report 
that with increased age of the cow the unsaturated acids increase at the 
expense of palmitic acid, which was lowered from 29 to 22-23 per cent by 
weight of the total fat in the four years of observations made on milk from 
the same group of cows. The saturated fatty acids are butyric, caproic, 
caprylic, capric, lauric, myristic, plamitic, and stearic. Arachadonic acid has 
been reported absent by some investigators. Butter fat contains a higher 
proportion of the first-named saturated acids than other food fats. The 
first ones in the series are quite volatile with steam, the volatility decreasing 
with increase in molecular weight of the acid. Hence, when butter is heated 
for several minutes, the percentage of the lower saturated fatty acids may 
be decreased. The unsaturated fatty acids include oleic, linoleic, and 
arachidic. 

Formerly it was thought that the particular flavor of butter was due 
to the greater proportion of the lower saturated fatty acids, but now it is 



\ 



296 MILK AND CHEESE 

known that butters with satisfactory flavor and aroma (Michaelian, 
Farmer, and Hammer) contain considerable quantities of acetylmethyl- 
carbinol plus diacetyl. The acetylmethylcarbinol in a pure condition is odor- 
less, but by bacterial action it is changed to diacetyl, which in concentra- 
tions of 0.0002 to 0.0004 per cent in or added to neutral butter gives a 
characteristic aroma. 

Size of fat globules. The fat in milk is found in small globules. These 
fat globules which are microscopic in size are suspended in the milk. They 
vary in size from 0.10/* to 22.0/x. Most of the globules are less than lOfx 
and average about 3fx in diameter. The size of the fat globules varies 
(1) with different breeds, being larger in milk from Jersey and Guernsey 
than in milk from other breeds, (2) with the lactation period, decreasing 
in size with length of the lactation period, and (3) with feed. Dry feed 
tends to decrease the size of the globules, succulent feed to increase their 
size. 

Ci'eaming. The specific gravity of the fat globules is less than that of 
the fluid of the milk. Hence there is a tendency for them to rise to the 
surface to form a cream layer. The extent of creaming depends upon several 
factors, such as the size of the fat globules, temperature of the milk, acidity, 
physical state of the fat, etc. Creaming occurs more rapidly in milk when 
the fat globules are quite large than when they are smaller. In rising to 
the top of the milk the globules of fat clump together, and this clumping 
increases the tendency for them to rise to the surface of the milk. As the 
larger clumps rise they may carry many of the smaller globules to the 
surface. Therefore, clumping not only aids the completeness of creaming 
but also the rate, for the rate is more rapid when the fat particles clump 
quickly. Rogers states that the factors affecting clumping are ''temperature, 
the acidity, the fat content and its degree of dispersion, the degree of 
agitation, and the fluidity of the system. The fat content, the degree of 
agitation and the fluidity of the system determine the probability of col- 
lisions of the globules." The tendency of the fat globules to clump is 
greatest when the milk is cooled rapidly to 7° to 8°C., but if the fat 
globules become solid at the low temperature before creaming is allowed to 
take place the rate of creaming is retarded. The temperature that favors 
clumping is also best for whipping the cream. Most cream is separated 
from the milk by mechanical means. The fat particles left in the milk 
after separating the cream are those less than 1/x and those between 1 and 
2/A in diameter. 

Butter. The fat globules in cow's milk are suspended in the milk and 
thus do not form a permanent emulsion, though they may be so reduced 
in size by homogenization that they form a permanent emulsion. Of the 
dififerent theories formulated for explaining the manner in which emulsions 
are stabilized the adsorption film theory is usually connected with milk. 
Substances that lower surface tension tend to collect at the interface be- 
tween two non-miscible systems. Proteins tend to lower the surface tension, 



FAT 297 

hence tend to collect at the interface. The layer or film around the fat 
globules probably consists of adsorbed calcium caseinate, with some lactal- 
bumin, globulin, and calcium phosphate. This membrane may be weakened 
or broken in various ways. When milk is heated slowly, the membrane 
surrounding some of the fat globules may be broken and a number of 
globules may coalesce. Sometimes milk that has been heated and then 
cooled has a more oily appearance due to this coalescing of the fat globules. 
The membrane surrounding the fat particles may be broken by mechanical 
agitation. Formation of butter in churning is brought about in this manner. 

There are two theories regarding butter formation. One is that the 
emulsion is reversed from the type found in the milk and that the butter 
is a water-in-fat emulsion. The other view is that butter is formed by 
packing the fat globules into a compact mass, and that water and air 
are enmeshed during this process. Temperature and the formation of a 
foam are both important in churning. At a temperature above 65 °C. there 
is no aggregation of fat particles. Below 65° the tendency to clump in- 
creases and is at a maximum at 7° to 8°C. A favorable temperature for 
butter formation is below 24° and above 10°C. At temperatures below 
4°C. the fat globules do not adhere to each other and aggregation does 
not take place. At temperatures above the melting point of butter, no 
butter is formed. 

The fat particles tend to clump at the liquid/air interface, so that air 
beaten in during the churning process accelerates clumping of the fat. 

Butter may be churned from sweet or sour cream. The flavor of butter 
from the sweet cream is milder and different from that of the sour-cream 
butter. Many housekeepers prefer the sweet-cream butter for table use and 
the sour-cream butter for cooking. 

The adsorbed films surrounding the fat globules may also be destroyed 
by the addition of acid or alkali. It is by these methods that the fat is 
set free for a quantitative determination. In the Babcock.test, acid is used 
for liberating the fat globules ; in the Hoyberg test alkali is used. The Bab- 
cock, or some modification of it, is the one usually employed in estimating 
the fat content of milk and cream. 

Protein. The chief proteins found in milk in order of their decreasing 
amounts are casein, lactalbumin, and lactoglobulin. 

Casein. Casein belongs to the group of phosphoproteins. The form in 
which the phosphorus exists in the casein is not definitely known, but it is 
believed to be present in the form of combined phosphoric acid. Casein 
forms about 3 per cent of cow's milk. 

At its isoelectric point, which is pH 4.6, casein is nearly insoluble in 
water. Casein is amphoteric and forms salts with acids and alkalies. Fresh 
milk has a reaction of about pH 6.6, so that the casein is present in the 
milk as salts of bases and is found as calcium and magnesium caseinates. 
All the alkali caseinates are soluble in water, though the salts of the 
alkaline earths are less soluble than the alkali ones. Loeb states that below 



298 MILK AND CHEESE 

/>H 4.6 the casein chloride, casein acetate, and casein lactate are very 
soluble in water, but casein sulfate and casein oxalate are difficultly soluble. 

According to Zoller, pure casein when heated in water begins to imbibe 
water at 80° to 90 °C. and becomes plastic. In this form it can be molded 
and shaped. Upon cooling it becomes very hard. 

Casein can be precipitated from milk by bringing the milk to the isoelec- 
tric point of casein. Coagulation of casein will be considered later. 

Lactalbumi?!. The proportion of lactalbumin in milk is much lower than 
that of casein. It forms about 0.50 per cent of cow's milk. Its isoelectric 
point is /)H 4.55. Since the reaction of fresh milk is about /)H 6.6, it is on 
the alkaline side of the isoelectric point of lactalbumin. Thus is it possible 
that the lactalbumin is found combined as salts of bases, such as calcium 
and magnesium albuminates. Osborne and Wakeman think it is uncom- 
bined. Lactalbumin is soluble in water, and is coagulated by heating in 
solution to a temperature of about 70°C. Coagulation may not be complete 
at this temperature. Palmer states that the lactalbumin is more highly dis- 
persed than the other colloidal constituents of the milk. 

LactoglohuUn. Lactoglobulin occurs in milk in very small quantities, 
about 0.05 per cent of cow's milk. Lactoglobulin is insoluble in distilled 
water, but it is soluble in dilute solutions of strong bases or acids, and 
in dilute salt solutions. It is coagulable by heat. 

Homogenization of Milk 

Globules of butter fat are suspended in the milk. They are surrounded 
by films of adsorbed caseinates, albuminates, and globulinates. The fat 
globules of milk are too large to form a permanent emulsion, so they grad- 
ually rise to the top of the milk in the form of cream. If the milk or cream 
is put through a machine called a homogenizer, the fat globules are reduced 
in size. This is accomplished by using pressure and forcing the milk or 
cream through small openings. Homogenized milk or cream may form a 
stable emulsion if the fat globules are reduced enough in size. Hence, when 
the fat is broken into fine enough globules the cream will not rise to the 
top of the homogenized milk. 

The size of the fat globules after homogenization depends upon the 
temperature of the milk during homogenization and the pressure used. 
With increase in temperature the degree of dispersion increases rapidly 
from 40° to 65°C., so that the smallest fat particles are obtained at 65°. 
Ordinarily temperatures above 65° are not used for homogenization. The 
size of the fat particles also decreases with increased pressure. 

Whipped cream is stabilized by proteins. The fat globules in cream 
are surrounded by films of protein substances. Homogenized cream also 
has the film of adsorbed proteins around the fat particles. Clayton states 
the fat particles in homogenized cream may be 1000 times greater in 
number than before homogenization. Since the number of fat particles is 



WHIPPING CREAM 299 

increased, the amount of globulinates, caseinates, and albuminates used in 
forming films is very much greater, for the surface area of the fat globules 
has increased enormously. 

Whipped cream is both an emulsion and a foam. The fat particles must 
be surrounded by a film of protein in order to be stabilized, and the air 
globules must be surrounded by a film of protein to stabilize them. In 
homogenized cream most of the protein is used in surrounding the fat 
globules, on account of the increased surface area of the smaller and 
increased number of fat globules, and thus there is not enough left to sur- 
round the air bubbles. Hence, homogenized cream seldom whips unless 
protein is added for film forming. 

Factors that affect the whipping quality of cream. In addition 
to the protein or film forming in whipping cream, the fat content, the size 
of the fat particles, the temperature of whipping, and the viscosity are 
important factors. Dahlberg and Hening have studied the relation of 
viscosity, surface tension, and whipping properties of milk and cream. They 
have found that increased viscosity increases the whipping properties of 
cream, but the lowering of the surface tension does not improve the 
whipping qualities. They have reported two changes taking place during 
whipping. The incorporation of air depends upon the milk proteins form- 
ing the film around the air globules, and the rigidity or stiffness of the 
whipped cream depends upon the clumping together of the fat particles. 
The best whipping cream did not give as large a volume as some other 
creams, but it had less liquid drain out of it after whipping. 

Cream whips better with an increasing fat content up to 35 per cent. 
The cream with the higher fat content gives more particles for clumping 
and also increases the viscosity of the cream. 

As the fat particles clump at the liquid/air interface, or within the 
liquid, the increased rigidity they give the foam permits inclusion of more 
air bubbles and extension of the films with the result that the dryness of 
the foam is increased. See Fig. 31. Larger fat particles clump more readily 
and thus form the structural support offered by the fat more easily. This 
offers an explanation of why cream from milk containing larger fat parti- 
cles, milk from Jersey and Guernsey breeds, whips more quickly than 
cream containing smaller fat particles, milk from other breeds. 

Aging improves the whipping qualities of cream. The viscosity increases 
with aging. As a general rule, treatment that increases the viscosity increases 
the whipping properties. Pasteurization tends to reduce the whipping 
quality of cream. 

Babcock has found that the best whipping is obtained at a temperature 
of 45 °F. or lower. At this temperature agitation favors the clumping 
together of the fat particles. At high temperatures, both the higher tem- 
perature and the agitation increase the dispersion of the fat. Above 50°F. 
the decrease in stiffness of whipped cream is in direct ratio to increase in 
temperature, so that 30-per cent cream will not whip at 72°F. 



300 



MILK AND CHEESE 



Babcock found acidity up to 0.3 per cent, at which sour taste is evident, 
had no effect on whipping quality. If acid was added in excess of 0.3 per 
cent, whipping quality improved, whether added to fresh or aged cream, 
when the amount added began to curdle the cream. 

The addition of sugar to cream either before or after whipping was 
found by Babcock to decrease the stiffness of the cream. For each 2 tea- 
spoons added to 100 cc. (about ]/\ cup) the stiffness decreased four points 
on the stiffness scale. Adding the sugar before whipping the cream 
decreased the volume obtained and increased the whipping time. 

The denaturation or coagulation of the protein film at the air/cream 
interface, increases the stiffness of the whipped cream. Since colloidal

the cream are shown as small black spots. Magnification about 180 (Rahn). 

reactions require time, it is a better practise to add sugar to whipped cream 
after, rather than before or during the whipping process. By this procedure 
denaturation is more complete, which offers an explanation of why the 
volume of the cream is less affected by the addition of the sugar last. The 
addition of sugar lessens the stiffness and decreases the volume of the 
whipped cream because it either prevents denaturation and/or peptizes 
the protein film. 

Reaction of Milk 

Freshly secreted milk is nearly neutral to litmus. The reaction varies 
slightly but has an approximate pYi of 6.6. The freshly secreted milk con- 
tains carbon dioxide. The amount of this gas in the milk decreases during 
milking and the subsequent handling of the milk, while the percentage of 
oxygen and nitrogen increase. For this reason the titratable acidity decreases 
for a time in milk exposed to the air. Confined milk does not show as great 



RENNET COAGULATION 301 

a decrease in titratable acidity as the exposed milk, for the percentage of 
carbon dioxide lost is smaller. 

Effect of heating milk on acidity. When milk is heated at the boil- 
ing point or at temperatures above or near the boiling point the titratable 
acidity at first decreases owing to the loss of carbon dioxide, and then 
increases. Whittier and Benton report that the hydrogen-ion concentra- 
tion increases continuously. They find the hydrogen-ion increase and the 
later increase in titratable acidity is due to the formation of acids from 
constituents of the milk. The amount of acid produced depends upon the 
time and temperature of heating, a greater amount of acid being produced 
with a longer heating period and with higher temperatures. From their 
experiments they conclude that the acid is produced from the lactose of the 
milk. They have shown that, the greater the concentration of lactose pres- 
ent, the greater the amount of acid formed at a definite temperature and 
for a definite time. 

Coagulation of Milk 

Under certain conditions, the addition of alcohol as well as the appli- 
cation of heat may cause coagulation of milk. Milk may be coagulated by 
the addition of rennin or by bringing the acidity oi the milk to the isoelec- 
tric point of the casein. When milk is combined with other foods, the salt 
content of the food or the tannin content of the food may be factors that 
aid coagulation. 

Alcohol coagulation. The addition of 70 per cent alcohol to milk may 
cause coagulation. As the pH of the milk decreases, it becomes susceptible 
to alcohol precipitation, though this varies with different milks. Usually 
the milk is precipitated by alcohol while it is still stable to heat and 
sterilizing temperatures. Some freshly secreted milk is coagulated by 
alcohol, but this milk is usually abnormal in some way. About 2 cc. of 
alcohol are added to an equal quantity of milk for the test. Casein is 
precipitated by alcohol as calcium caseinate, calcium is not released as by 
acid coagulation. 

Rennet coagulation. Milk may be coagulated by the addition of 
rennet. Rennet is an extract that is usually obtained from the inner lining 
of the stomachs of calves and lambs. The rennet contains an enzyme called 
rennase or rennin. 

The clotting of the milk is generally believed to be the direct action of 
the rennin on the casein. But the manner in which these changes is pro- 
duced is not fully understood. A very small amount of rennin is capable 
of coagulating a large amount of milk. At favorable or optimum hydrogen- 
ion concentrations for clotting, 1 part of the fairly pure enzyme prepara- 
tion is able to coagulate 3,000,000 or more parts of milk. 

Mechanism of clotting. It is usually stated that the casein is changed to 
paracasein by the action of the rennin. It is also often stated that the 



302 MILK AND CHEESE 

clotting is brought about in two steps, the first being the action of rennin 
on the casein and the second the precipitation of the changed casein. Rogers 
reviews the many theories of rennin coagulation. Some investigators claim 
the changes are purely chemical; others maintain the rennin affects only 
the physical state of the calcium caseinate. However, if the change can be 
explained on the basis of colloid chemistry, it is probable that absorption 
and the electric charge play an important role in the process. Rogers states 
that Hammarsten regards casein in milk as a calcium caseinate-calcium 
phosphate complex. '*As a matter of fact the compound called calcium 
caseinate is most probably a true calcium phosphocaseinate, if, as seems 
likely, the second and third hydrogens of the orthophosphoric acid esterfied 
with certain of the amino acids in the casein molecule react with calcium. 
The correct conception of the term 'calcium phosphocaseinate,' as it is 
now commonly employed, is that of a colloidal calcium phosphate (or 
phosphates) sol protected by a calcium caseinate (or caseinates) sol in a 
manner as yet imperfectly understood." The stabilization of sols is best 
explained by the theory of Helmholtz, i.e., each colloidal particle is sur- 
rounded by an electrical double layer. ''In the case of negatively charged 
sols, in which class calcium caseinate and calcium paracaseinate evidently 
fall, the outer layer consists of hydrogen ions. If these are replaced by a 
sufficient number of positively charged ions of higher charge, e.g., calcium 
ions carrying two positive charges" ; or, in other words, if these ions are 
more strongly adsorbed than the hydrogen ions, the colloid particle will 
readily precipitate, the rate of clotting being determined by the rate of 
replacement. 

Richardson and Palmer state that rennin itself may reduce the charge 
of the calcium caseinate micelle and thus reduce the stability of the casein 
sol. They found indications that the isoelectric point of rennin is about pH 
6.9 to 7.0. Above this pH the rennin is negatively charged and below pH 
6.9 it is positively charged. They found that rennin lowered the electro- 
phoretic velocity of calcium caseinate and calcium phosphocaseinate micelles 
when the casein sol was negatively charged and the rennin was positively 
charged, but not when the rennin was negatively charged (above its iso- 
electric point, pK 6.9 to 7.0). From this evidence and from the fact that 
paracaseinate micelles are not affected by rennin, which agrees with the 
fact that casein once coagulated by rennin has lost its sensitiveness to this 
enzyme, they suggest that rennin acts by sensitizing the casein by a pre- 
liminary reduction of the electric charge on the casein micelles. 

During the clotting of the milk, aside from the consistency of the milk, 
there is little change in its physical properties. The hydrogen-ion concen- 
tration does not change during the clotting process. 

Factors affecting action of rennin. Several factors influence the 
activity of the rennin in bringing about coagulation. These may be listed 
as follows: (1) temperature for rennin action; (2) heating the milk before 
the addition of rennin; (3) hydrogen-ion concentration; (4) concentration 



FACTORS AFFECTING ACTION OF RENNIN 303 

of casein, calcium, and phosphate ion; (5) character of cations used for 
coagulation. 

Temperature for rennin action. The optimum coagulation by calf rennin 
is about 40° to 42°C. Below this temperature coagulation is less rapid 
and no clotting occurs below 10° to 15°C. Also no clotting occurs above 
60° to 65 °C. The clot is softer at low temperatures and tougher and 
stringy at high temperatures. By optimum is meant the temperature at 
which coagulation takes place most rapidly for a definite concentration of 
rennin and milk. 

Effect of previously boiling the milk upon rennin coagulation. If milk 
is boiled and then cooled before the rennin is added, the rate of coagulation 
is retarded and a much softer, more flocculent clot is obtained. Pasteuriza- 
tion also affects the rate of coagulation of the milk and the type of clot 
formed by rennin but not to the extent that boiling does. 

Richardson and Palmer found by electrokinetic evidence that heat in- 
creased the electric charge on the casein micelles or the cataphoretic velocity 
of the casein solution. The fact that rennin does not form as firm a clot 
with milk that has been previously heated indicates that rennin reduces 
the charge on the casein particles but not sufficiently to form a firm clot. 
This offers a colloidal explanation of why the addition of active cations 
(as calcium chloride) to heated milk causes the rennin to coagulate the 
milk normally. 

Hydrogen-ion concentration. The reaction of the milk affects the rapid- 
ity of coagulation and the character of the curd formed. Ordinarily when 
the reaction of the milk is alkaline coagulation does not occur. This is 
shown by the addition of a small amount of soda to milk before the addi- 
tion of junket. The optimum hydrogen-ion concentration for rennin activity 
has been reported to lie in the zone between pH 5.99 and 6.40. 

Character of cations. In addition to rennin, cations are necessary to 
bring about coagulation of milk. Because casein and calcium are so closely 
involved in milk, the cation calcium is important in bringing about coagula- 
tion. Hence, Rogers states that it is to be expected that the concentration 
of both casein and calcium markedly affect both the rate of coagulation and 
the character of the clot. If milk is diluted with sufficient water, clotting 
is both delayed and incomplete, the clot being soft. If calcium chloride 
is added to the water, diluted milk clotting properties are restored, which 
suggests that the concentration of calcium ions is more important than 
that of the casein ions. 

Rogers states that any metallic ion can replace the calcium in coagulation. 
However, it is generally accepted that the sodium and potassium salts of 
paracasein are soluble. Monovalent ions are less effective than divalent 
ones in replacing the calcium. Rogers reports that all monovalent ions did 
not bring about coagulation in some instances. The divalent ions were not 
all equally effective, calcium and barium being more efficient than mag- 
nesium. 



304 MILK AND CHEESE 

Sugar. Sugar tends to prevent the coagulation of milk by rennin. 

Coagulation of milk by acid. Kruyt states that there are some 
proteins that are not sufficiently hydrated to be stable by hydration alone. 
He cites casein as an example of a protein "which can exist either in acid 
or in an alkaline solution, but does not dissolve in water, with the con- 
sequence that the sol ordinarily flocculates when neutralized." Either 
the acid produced during fermentation or acids added to milk precipitate 
the casein. The casein is least soluble at its isoelectric point /)H 4.6. If 
enough acid is added to lower the /)H below 4.6, casein salts, such as 
casein chloride or casein lactate, are formed. If these salts are soluble, the 
casein goes into solution. Hence the largest yield of precipitated casein is 
near the isoelectric point. 

Fermentation of milk. Fermentation, or the production of lactic acid 
from lactose by bacteria, takes place in milk that is allowed to stand under 
favorable conditions. Rogers states that true lactic acid fermentation is 
brought about by the Streptococcus lactis and certain other organisms, 
lactic acid being the principal end-product, other products being present 
in only small amounts. In mixed lactic acid fermentation, or when other 
organisms in addition to S. lactis are present, the end-products may include 
acetic, propionic, lactic, succinic, formic, and butyric acids, carbon dioxide, 
hydrogen, acetone, and ethanol. As fermentation increases, an acidity is 
reached at which the action of most bacteria is suppressed. When fermenta- 
tion is checked at />H 4.8 to 5.0, the bacteria consists chiefly of Strepto- 
coccus lactis. 

The rate of fermentation depends chiefly upon the temperature at which 
the milk is held. At low temperatures, on account of retardation of bac- 
terial action, it takes place slowly. Rogers states that fermented milk, 
allow^ed to stand at a fairly high temperature, undergoes a second lactic 
acid fermentation brought about by the Lactobacillus bulgaricus organ- 
isms. Some of these types of bacteria form a high percentage of acid and 
the hydrogen-ion concentration may reach /)H 3.23. 

Changes occurring during acid precipitation. During fermentation chem- 
ical and physical changes occur in the milk. The flavor becomes acid. The 
calcium caseinate is changed to casein. During this process calcium is split 
off and forms soluble calcium lactate. In addition some dicalcium phos- 
phate is converted into monocalcium phosphate. Curdling or clotting occurs 
when the acidity reaches about pH 5.3. During the clotting process the 
hydrogen-ion concentration does not increase. Milk clotted by fermenta- 
tion is often called clabbered milk. Its flavor and aroma may vary, depend- 
ing upon the types of bacteria producing the fermentation. Fermented 
milk may be used for drinking, for cooking, and for cottage cheese. 

Cheese, such as cottage cheese, when clotted by acid coagulation, loses a 
large proportion of its calcium. The calcium salts become soluble more 
rapidly than the phosphorus ; hence a larger proportion of the calcium than 
of the phosphorus is lost in the whey. Casein precipitated by rennin retains 



HEAT COAGULATION 305 

most of its insoluble salts, hence has a larger proportion of calcium than 
the acid precipitated casein. 

Heat Coagulation. The term heat coagulation refers to the so-called 
"denaturation" of the protein, by which it is rendered insoluble. 

Lactalbumin. Lactalbumin has temperatures for heat coagulation similar 
to that of egg albumin. The lactalbumin forms a flocculent precipitate, 
whereas egg albumin forms a firm coagulum. Rupp has reported the fol- 
lowing amount of lactalbumin coagulated when heated for 30 minutes.

Casein. Casein is not coagulated by heat at ordinary temperatures or 
when heated for short periods, though the heating may alter the casein. 
Rogers states that it is necessary to heat milk about 12 hours at 100°C. to 
bring about coagulation. It takes approximately 1 hour at 135°C. and 
approximately 3 minutes at 155°C. The time and temperature vary some- 
what with different milks. 

The rate of coagulation depends upon the concentration of the casein as 
well as the time and the temperature of heating. Rogers states that 
evaporated milk, containing twice the concentration of solids-not-fat in 
normal milk, and thus a higher concentration of casein, requires about 60 
minutes for coagulation at 114.5°C., 10 minutes at 131 °C., and 7500 
minutes at 80°C. 

Rogers and Palmer both state that, in the evaporated-milk industry, 
the forewarming of milk prior to processing increases its stability to heat. 
"Rapid improvement in resistance to heat coagulation results in increase 
in temperature for prewarming up to 90° to 100°C. Above 90°C. the 
change is very small, but in some cases can be effected with increases in 
temperature up to 120°C. for 10-minute periods of forewarming. When 
time is chosen as the variable, improvement may be noted with increases in 
the time up to 30 minutes at a temperature of 95 °C. At higher tempera- 
tures the same improvement may be effected in shorter periods of time." 

Fat. Rogers states that fat particles in relatively large aggregates may 
act as nuclei about which coagulation of the casein can proceed. In un- 
homogenized milk the fat affects the coagulation time and temperature but 
slightly. But when a milk of higher fat content is homogenized the fat 
clumps may act as nuclei about which the casein may gather during heat- 
ing. With increase in homogenization pressure as well as fat content, other 
conditions being the same, a marked decrease in stability to heat is noted. 
In homogenized milk it was found that the maximum stability to heat 
coagulation occurs if homogenization is carried out at 80°. 



306 MILK AND CHEESE 

Rogers adds that the feathering of some homogenized cream when 
added to coffee may be caused by using too high homogenization pressure, 
thus reducing the stability of the cream to heat. 

The role of salts in heat coagulation of milk. In heat coagulation of 
milk, the milk salts play an important role, for the salt equilibrium is 
altered by heat. When milk is boiled precipitation of part of the calcium 
phosphate occurs. Sommer and Hart have concluded that salts are the 
main factor in heat coagulation of fresh milk. Electrolytes have a marked 
effect upon the stability of colloids. In precipitating a hydrophilic colloid 
divalent and trivalent ions are generally more effective than monovalent 
ones. In the milk are found the monovalent cations, sodium and potas- 
sium; the monovalent anion, chlorine; the divalent cations, calcium and 
magnesium; and the trivalent anions, phosphate and citrate. Sommer and 
Hart concluded that the coagulation of milk on heating may be due to an 
excess or a deficiency of calcium and magnesium. They explain this as 
follows. "The casein of the milk is most stable with regard to heat when 
it is in combination with the calcium. If the calcium combined with the 
casein is above or below this optimum, the casein is not in its most stable 
condition. The calcium of the milk distributes itself between the casein, 
citrates, and phosphates chiefly. If the milk is high in citrate and phosphate 
content, more calcium is necessary in order that the casein may retain its 
optimum calcium content after competing with the citrates and phosphates. 
If the milk is high in calcium there may not be sufficient citrates and 
phosphates to compete with the casein to lower its calcium content to the 
optimum. In such cases the addition of citrates or phosphates makes the 
casein more stable by reducing its calcium content. The magnesium func- 
tions by replacing the calcium in the citrates and phosphates." 

Heat coagulation of casein endothermic. Leighton and Mudge have 
shown that an endothermic reaction accompanies the appearance of visible 
curds when milk is coagulated by heat. This is accompanied by precipita- 
tion of calcium and magnesium as phosphate and citrates. 

A similar reaction occurs in custard. In cooking custard, the ingredients 
of which are milk, egg, and sugar, the temperature drops or does not rise 
for a period of time during coagulation or setting of the custard, a condition 
particularly noticeable just before curdling takes place. 

Coagulation of milk by cooking meat or vegetables in it. Fresh 
milk is seldom coagulated by heating for home use. The temperature 
attained in ordinary heating is not great enough to cause coagulation, nor 
is the milk heated for the long period required for coagulation at boiling 
temperatures. But with the addition of other foods to milk in food prepara- 
tion, coagulation often occurs with a very short period of heating. One 
of the factors in this coagulation is undoubtedly the salt content of the 
food added to the milk as well as the salt content of the milk. The balance 
of the milk salts for greatest stability may be upset and coagulation occurs 
when the food is heated in the milk. 



COOKING OF VEGETABLES IN MILK 307 

Cooking o£ meat in milk. Ham is often baked in milk. Sometimes 
pork chops are floured, seared in fat, and then baked in milk. Other meats 
and fish are sometimes baked or cooked in milk. Often curdling of the 
milk occurs, and the appearance of the meat, owing to adherence of curds 
of milk, is not attractive. Thus it is desirable to prevent curdling. Among 
the causes of curdling are the temperature at w^hich the meat is cooked, 
the salt content of the food cooked in the milk, the manner in vrhich the 
milk is added to the meat, and the reaction of the milk. 

The higher the temperature at vs^hich the meat is cooked the greater 
the tendency to curdle. Larger curds are also formed at higher tempera- 
tures. The temperature to vrhich milk must be heated to bring about curd- 
ling is high, so this cooking temperature alone is not sufficient to bring 
about the coagulation. Even when the meat is cooked in an oven at a high 
temperature, the liquid portion does not reach a higher temperature than 
boiling. It is possible that the acidity is increased during cooking, but the 
resulting />H of the meat-milk broth is changed very little from that of the 
original milk or from that of the meat broth when the meat is cooked in 
water. Thus it seems that the heating and the acidity developed during 
cooking do not alone bring about coagulation. 

The salt content of the food cooked in the milk probably influences the 
coagulation, and this combined with the heating, the temperature of heat- 
ing, the acidity developed, and the altering of the casein by heat are suf- 
ficient to cause curdling. Sodium chloride has some effect, for curdling is 
more likely to occur when the meat cooked in the milk is a cured or salted 
one than when fresh meat is used. 

Curdling may be prevented by the addition of soda, about 1/16 teaspoon 
per cup of milk. From this it appears that the reaction has some part in 
the coagulation. The soda may combine with other salts that tend to bring 
about coagulation or the coagulation may be prevented by the slightly 
alkaline reaction. A slightly alkaline reaction also prevents coagulation by 
rennin and by fermentation. 

If a portion of the milk is added to the meat when cooking is first 
started and the rest of the cold milk added gradually to the meat during 
the cooking period, curdling is less likely to occur. The addition of acid 
foods, such as prepared mustard, which may contain vinegar, or apples 
and pears to be baked with the meat, would tend to increase the tendency 
to curdle. Evaporated milk has less tendency to curdle than fresh milk, 
which may be due to the previous heating. 

Cooking of vegetables in milk. Milk usually does not curdle when 
cabbage, chard, spinach, or cauliflower is cooked in it. But it is likely 
to curdle when asparagus, string beans, peas, and carrots are cooked in it. 
Asparagus usually curdles the milk after a few minutes of cooking. There 
are several factors that may aid in bringing about coagulation of the milk. 
The slight acidity of some vegetables combined with the heating of the 
milk may tend to bring about coagulation, but the acidity is not usually 



308 MILK AND CHEESE 

great enough, nor the boiling temperature high enough, nor the boiling 
long enough continued for these factors to be very important. The salt 
and the tannin contents of the vegetables are probably the principal causes 
of coagulation. Some vegetables contain larger amounts of tannin than 
others. Tannin is a dehydrating agent and brings about denaturation of 
hydrophilic sols, like gelatin, starch, and agar-agar. After denaturation the 
hydrophile is sensitive to small amounts of electrolytes and precipitation 
occurs readily. Kruyt states that tannins do not bring about dehydration 
of the protein in an alkaline medium. Hence the addition of soda in small 
amounts to the milk in w^hich the vegetable is cooked prevents coagulation 
of the milk. Tannins lower the surface tension, which results in foaming 
of vegetables containing tannin when they are cooked in water. It is rather 
interesting that the vegetables that usually foam the most when cooked 
in water are the ones that have the greatest tendency to coagulate milk. 

Tomato soup. When tomatoes are combined with milk to make cream of 
tomato soup, coagulation may occur. The acidity of tomatoes varies some- 
what, but is about pH 4.4 to 4.6. If the amount of tomato added to the 
milk is great enough to lower the /)H of the mixed milk and tomato to 
4.8 to 4.6, the casein is precipitated without heating. This may happen if 
the milk is already fairly acid. 

Since a longer time of heating milk increases the tendency to curdle it is 
preferable to heat tomato soup for only a short time. Heating slowly also 
increases the tendency to curdle, which may be due to the longer time 
required. In Experiment 55 in the laboratory outline several different 
methods of combining the tomato juice and milk are given. The tomato 
is usually added to the milk by stirring, for in this w^ay the milk is diluted 
with a smaller amount of acid substance during the first part of the mixing. 
There is less tendency to curdle when the hot tomato is added to cold milk, 
than when the cold tomato is added to hot milk. Probably the slight 
denaturation brought about by heating the milk may partially account 
for this. Occasionally some milk is acid enough and the tomato is acid 
enough to cause curdling with all methods of combining unless soda is 
added. At other times curdling does not occur with any method of com- 
bining as outlined in this experiment. 

Fruits and milk. When cream is added to fruit, clotting often occurs. 
This is usually due to the acidity of the fruit, but may also be due to an 
enzyme in it. Raw pineapple contains an enzyme, bromelin, that brings 
about clotting of milk. However, the pineapple juice not only brings about 
clotting but also peptization, for after a time the clot formed is less firm 
and the flavor is similar to that of peptized meat. 

Boiling and Heating of Milk 

The physical and chemical properties of the constituents of milk account 
for the behavior of milk during its use in food preparation. Thus sub- 



SUGAR REACTIONS WITH PROTEINS OF MILK 309 

stances that lower surface tension become concentrated in the liquid/air 
interface. Proteins lower the surface tension of aqueous sols, hence accu- 
mulate in the surface. When milk is heated in an open pan, a scum or skin 
forms over the surface of the milk. At first this skin is rather thin and 
mobile but is gradually altered so that it becomes tenacious and tough 
enough to be removed with a stirring rod or spoon. This scum has been 
said to contain coagulated albumin and globulin. Tinkler and Masters 
state that if the scum is removed as formed, the total amount of protein 
that can be removed exceeds the total amount of albumin and globulin in 
the milk. 

When foods are cooked in milk the milk not only foams readily but the 
scum tends to hold the steam formed in heating the milk; it is because 
of this that the milk ''boils over" so readily. 

Sugar Reactions with Proteins o£ Milk 

Ramsay, Tracy, and Ruehe investigated the substitution of dextrose for 
sucrose in sweetened condensed skim milk. They found the objections to 
using dextrose were (1) a brown discoloration, (2) a physical thickening, 
and (3) crystallization of the dextrose during storage. The last objection 
could be remedied by using 50 per cent dextrose and 50 per cent sucrose. 
The progressive thickening during storage at high temperature was caused 
by action of the dextrose on the casein and albumin of the milk. During 
this investigation they found additional evidence that sugars react with 
proteins. When dextrose, lactose, or levulose was heated with skim milk or 
freshly precipitated casein, a dark brown color formed In the product. 
When the sugars were heated In distilled water solutions to 250°F. for 
30 minutes no caramelizatlon occurred. Neither did darkening occur when 
albumin or casein was heated in water solution. But when the milk, 
albumin, or casein was heated with lactose or dextrose, a brown dis- 
coloration occurred. As the temperature was raised the dextrose and 
casein became so firmly attached to each other that no amount of washing 
could remove the sugar. Most of the biruet action of the skim milk was 
lost. The results were explained on the basis that a protein-sugar complex 
of glucosidal nature was formed. 

On heating amino acids with dextrose highly colored products were 
formed, the reaction probably being a condensation of an amino acid with 
an aldehyde or ketone group of the sugar. The very stable linkage of the 
aldehyde group of the dextrose and the ketone group of the fructose In the 
sucrose molecule Is cited to explain the failure of sucrose to form condensa- 
tion products with casein, albumin, or amino acids. It was found that as 
the reaction became more alkaline the appearance of the brown color was 
more rapid. The Increased alkalinity was said to favor the change of the 
sugar from a lactone to a free aldehyde form, the free aldehyde acting with 
the amino acid or -NHo groups of the protein. If the pH was much 



310 MILK AND CHEESE 

above 7 the milk was almost black. Hence, the sugar used, the reaction, 
and temperature all influenced the development of the brown color. The 
length of heating in connection with the temperature was important as 
relatively high temperatures for a short period gave only slight develop- 
ment of the brown color. It is almost impossible to retain the natural color 
of fresh milk in the condensed milk products, for some brow^n discoloration 
occurs in the unsweetened and sweetened product whether made from 
whole or skim milk. 

Whittier and Benton had shown that the hydrogen-ion concentration 
increases at a rate which is the function of the lactose concentration and 
the time and temperature of heating. Or, in other words, when milk is 
heated for a sufficient time at high enough temperatures the lactose is 
decomposed with formation of acid products. Hence, when milk is heated 
with sucrose the increasing acidity inverts some of the sucrose to dextrose 
and levulose, with the development of a brownish color. One example of 
this is in the cooking of caramels, more brown color developing with long 
slow cooking of the sucrose and milk. Another instance where this is used 
to advantage is in making caramel pudding by boiling, in the can, sweetened 
condensed milk for three hours or longer. The can and contents are chilled. 
On opening the can it is found that the contents have developed the brown 
color of caramelized products and are thickened to the consistency of a 
pudding. 

This combination of sugar with milk proteins to form a thickened 
product is interesting in view of the fact that sucrose, dextrose, and levu- 
lose prevent the heat coagulation of egg albumin. 

The housewife also makes use of the effect of acid on sweetened con- 
densed milk. If about Yi cup of lemon juice is stirred into the contents of 
a can (about 1^ cups) of sweetened condensed milk, the mixture thickens 
to a consistency that can be used for a pudding or pie filling and may be 
thinned with water to a desired consistency. The explanation of the 
thickening lies in the action of the acid on the complex sugar-protein 
combination. 

Cheese 

Definition. The Food and Drug Administration defines cheese, in the 
regulatory announcements, as "a product made from curd obtained from 
the whole, partly skimmed, or skimmed milk of cows, or from milk of 
other animals with or without added cream, by coagulating with rennet, 
lactic acid, or other suitable enzyme or acid, and with or without further 
treatment of the separated curd by heat or pressure, or by means of ripen- 
ing ferments, special molds, or seasoning." 

Classification of cheese. Cheese may be classified in many ways as 
(1) method by which the curd is produced, i.e., acid or rennet coagula- 
tion, (2) source of the milk, from cow, sheep, or goat, and (3) the 



COAGULATION OF MILK FOR CHEESE 311 

texture and consistency of the cheese, i.e., whether soft, semi-hard, or hard. 
Many other classifications might be used but none of them are entirely 
satisfactory. 

Doane and Lawson list and describe nearly 300 cheeses. They state 
there are probably about 18 distinct varieties of cheese. 

For purposes of discussion, Rogers classifies cheese as follows: 

Soft Hard 

Unripened Semi-hard 

Cottage Ripened by molds 

Cream Gorgonzola 

Neufchatel Roquefort 

Ripened Stilton 

Ripened by molds Ripened by bacteria 

Camembert Brick 

Brie Munster 

Ripened by bacteria Very hard 

Limberger Without gas holes 

Liderkranz Cheddar 

Edam 
Gouda 
With gas holes 
Emmenthal 
Swiss 
Parmesan 

Composition of cheese. From the standpoint of quantity the prin- 
cipal constituents of cheese are casein, fat, and water. In addition it 
contains various salts, and unless heated to pasteurization temperatures 
various organisms such as bacteria and molds. Different types of soft 
cheese may contain from 40 to 75 per cent of water, hence this type does 
not keep long. Hard-type cheeses usually average 30 to 40 per cent 
moisture. The soft types may contain from 13 to 21 per cent of protein 
and from 0.5 to 50 per cent of fat. Hard types contain from 20 to 45 per 
cent protein and 19 to 40 per cent fat. 

Coagulation of milk for cheese. Coagulation may be brought about 
by rennet or acid. Rennet-formed curds are more elastic, the acid ones 
more sticky. In acid-formed curds more of the calcium salts are split off 
from casein, forming calcium chloride which is soluble in the whey. Rennet- 
coagulated cheeses of cheddar types retain about 80 per cent of the calcium 
of milk, whereas soft cheeses retain about 20 per cent. 

The temperature for coagulation varies with the type of cheese desired. 
In general, the lower the temperature the softer the curd. Curds formed 
at 21° to 25°C. are used for some soft cheeses. Cheddar cheese has a 
firmer curd and the milk is brought to 30°C. before the starter and rennet 
are added. Temperatures as high as 48°C. may be used for some cheese. 



312 MILK AND CHEESE 

the curd produced being distinctly tough and somewhat rubbery and 
elastic. 

Making cheese. The essential steps in making cheese are: blending 
the particular type of milk desired ; bringing the milk to a definite tempera- 
ture ; adding lactic acid culture for types of cheese that need greater 
hydrogen-ion concentration when the rennet is added (acid cultures are 
added to cheddar types, but not to Sw^ss) ; adding vegetable color, if 
cheese is to be yellow, omitting if cheese is to be American white; and 
adding the rennet. After coagulation the curds are cut to the definite size 
for the type of cheese desired. Small curds retain less moisture within the 
curd but the whey does not drain so well from the curd. The next step 
is stirring the curd gently to facilitate draining of the whey. The curd is 
then ditched, salted, put in molds lined with cloth, and pressed into defi- 
nite shapes as Longhorms, Prints, Daisies, Flats, Twins, and Cheddars. 
After being pressed the cheese may be soaked in salt brine or dry salt may 
be rubbed on the surface. Sometimes no additional salting occurs. Soft 
unripened cheese is not cured ; but after being pressed or molded other 
types are placed on shelves in caves or specially constructed curing rooms 
to ripen. In the latter ventilation, humidity, and temperature may be care- 
fully controlled according to the type of cheese. The curing period varies 
for different types of cheese and for the same type. For example, Cheddar 
may be cured from 2 or 3 months to 2 years. With longer curing a 
sharper, richer, and fuller flavor is developed. 

Cheese, after being cured, is often blended for uniform flavor, texture, 
and body. 

Secondary heating o£ the curd. A secondary heating of the curd is 
necessary with most hard and semi-hard cheeses. Making Emmenthal in- 
volves heating to about 55° to 58°C. This heating hastens the driving of 
the whey from the curd, changes its texture, and often alters the bacterial 
flora. The heating at high temperatures decreases the moisture content and 
rennet action is checked if not wholly stopped. Various physical changes 
take place during this period, the curd becoming tough, firmer, and rubbery. 
In Swiss and Parmesan cheese it also acquires plasticity. 

Ripening of cheese. In the process of ripening chemical and physical 
changes occur In the cheese. It loses Its tough, rubbery qualities and becomes 
soft and mellow, sometimes almost crumbly. During this change as much 
as 50 per cent of the nitrogenous constituents may be converted to soluble 
forms, though the average for hard cheese Is 30 per cent. These changes 
not only alter the texture and flavor, but also alter the cooking quality of 
the cheese, the Increased solubility of the proteins Increasing the ease with 
which the cheese may be blended with eggs, milk, and white sauce. 

Ripening Is slower at lower temperatures and more rapid at higher ones. 
Not only enzymes of the milk, if the milk has not been heated to a tem- 
perature to destroy the enzymes, but bacteria aid in ripening of the cheese 
and hydrolysis of the proteins. Some bacteria, such as lactic acid, produce 



PROCESSED CHEESE 313 

enzymes that split the protein. More hydrolysis occurs in the softer center 
of hard cheese than near the rind. Salting affects the rate of ripening by 
delaying bacterial growth, the proteins of cheese with more salt becoming 
soluble at a slower rate. Salt penetrates slowly from the rind to the center 
and aids in drying the cheese. Changes in the fat in the interior of most 
cheese are usually negligible. 

For the growth of molds and aerobic bacteria, holes must be punched 
in the cheese to allow oxygen from the air to penetrate. 

In the early stages of ripening Emmenthal and Swiss cheeses are soft 
and become elastic. It is during this stage that the holes or "eyes" are 
formed from production of gas, principally carbon dioxide, if ripening is 
normal, but with more hydrogen in abnormal or early ripening. If the 
cheese becomes too firm before the formation of holes is complete, checks 
and cracks appear in the cheese. 

Cheddar cheese in cans. The Bureau of Animal Industry (Rogers) 
has announced a practical method of canning unripened Cheddar cheese. 
By this method a one-way or check valve, which holds perfectly against 
external pressure but with internal pressure allows gases formed during 
ripening of the cheese to escape, is inserted in the lid of the can. Cheddar 
cheese has always been pressed in cylindrical forms of varying sizes, but in 
general rather large. When these large cheeses are cut they lose moisture, 
so the cut surface dries rapidly. In addition, if the cheese is well ripened, 
loss occurs through crumbling. 

In packing cheese in cans, the cheese, after pressing, is cut into the desired 
shape. Since hydrogen sulfide is often liberated during ripening of cheese, 
it is preferable to wrap the cheese in parchment and it is necessary to use 
a lacquered can, for the hydrogen sulfide tends to form a black product 
with metals such as iron, copper, or lead. 

Processed cheese. Rogers states that before the development of the 
can in which Cheddar cheese may be ripened, the "only commercial method 
for putting Cheddar cheese into a more attractive and convenient form is 
the one known as processing. After the rind is removed, the cheese is 
ground, a small quantity of water and an emulsifier, usually sodium citrate, 
are added, and the mass is heated with constant stirring until it becomes 
fluid. The emulsion is run into forms, which in many cases are boxes lined 
with tinfoil, in which it is sold. The cheese hardens quickly and, as the 
wrapping adheres closely, there is no trouble from molds. Moreover, as the 
temperature is high enough to constitute pasteurization, most of the bacteria 
are killed and the enzymes destroyed, so that ripening is stopped. In this 
process, much of the original character of the cheese is lost; but, in spite 
of this objection, the advantage of the package is so great that a large part, 
possibly one-third, of all the cheese made in the United States is sold in 
this form." 

Templeton and Sommer have investigated various salts that may be used 
as emulsifiers in processed cheese. They state the purpose of the salt is to 



I 



314 MILK AND CHEESE 

prevent separation of the fat from the cheese and at the same time give the 
finished product the desired body and texture. They quote Habicht as 
stating that an alkaline monovalent cation combined with a polyvalent 
anion, such as sodium citrate, is the ideal emulsifying salt. The physico- 
chemical explanation is as follows: There is partial saponification between 
the cation (sodium, if sodium citrate is used) and the fatty acids. The soaps 
formed are good emulsifiers. In addition the anion, which is a solvent for 
casein, combines with the casein of cheese so that a film of casein surrounds 
each fat globule, thus emulsifying it and preventing its escape from the 
mass. Later we find that the citrate ion is also a good peptizer of egg and 
flour proteins. 

Loaf cheese. Rogers states that blending is used extensively for 
Cheddar and Swiss cheese. In this process the cheese is ground and heated 
in steam-jacketed kettles, 60° to 70°, and then poured into molds. In the 
initial heating separation of the fat occurs; but with longer heating the 
casein becomes plastic and stringy and encloses the fat. Further agitation 
causes the mass to lose its plasticity and become the consistency of heavy 
cream. At this time it is poured into the molds. 

The plasticity of the cheese is an important part of the process. Once 
the plasticity is broken it is almost impossible to restore it. The method of 
manufacture, the degree of ripening, the acidity of the cheese, and possibly 
other factors influence the degree of plasticity attainable in the heated 
cheese and the length of time the mass will remain plastic. Sodium and 
ammonia seem important in the emulsification of the product. 

Cheese spreads. The term cheese spread may be applied to any pack- 
aged form of cheese that can be easily spread with a knife at ordinary room 
temperature. Templeton and Sommer name the types on the market as: 
(1) cream cheese, mixed with pickles, olives, etc., (2) processed cheese of 
such age and moisture content as to be "spready," and (3) processed cheese 
with concentrated whey or skim milk powder added and of such fat and 
moisture content that the mix will spread easily. They say that, since the 
composition is quite different from cheese, as defined for Food and Drug 
regulations, the product cannot be sold as cheese. Actually they are sold as 
food products under proprietary trade names. The desirable spreading 
qualities may be due to the moisture content or the fat content or both. 

The use of cheese in cooked products. All of the factors that 
affect the plasticity of the cheese when heated for blending, i.e., the degree 
of ripening, the acidity, and method of manufacture, also affect its blending 
properties with other ingredients in such dishes as rarebit, cheese souflSe, 
and macaroni and cheese. To these factors may be added the extent of 
drying. For the cut or grated surface of cheese may dry rather extensively. 
Hence, the protein in the surface area really needs soaking for hydration 
before it will blend with other ingredients, or it may entirely lose its 
plasticity. 

Cream cheese may be combined with eggs, sugar, etc., for cheese cake or 



REFERENCES 315 

similar cooked dishes. But, in general, whether in its original state after 
curing, or processed, the Cheddar type is the cheese usually combined with 
cooked products. 

The cheese is combined with white sauce or eggs at low temperatures and 
by stirring. The temperature should be as low or lower than that used for 
blending, 40° to 50°C. often being preferable to 60° to 70°C. As the 
protein becomes plastic the fat exudes. Stirring aids in emulsifying this fat 
with white sauce and casein of the cheese. 

Cheese souffle. A colleague, Plagge, suggested a good method of com- 
bining the ingredients for cheese souffle. The beaten egg yolks were added 
to the white sauce before the grated cheese, because the addition of the egg 
5^olks cooled the mixture to a greater extent before the cheese was added. 
However, another advantage of this order of mixing is that the egg yolk 
aids in emulsifying the fat of the cheese. For the same reason beating with 
a rotary egg beater as the cheese softens is a good method of blending the 
cheese with the white sauce, since it more efficiently divides the cheese, thus 
increasing the surface area for emulsification. 

Processed cheese usually combines particularly well with white sauce 
and egg yolk, because of its added water content and the emulsification 
of the fat.

2. Reverse the order and temperatures for adding the cheese and eg^ yolk. 
Add the cheese to the slightly cooled white sauce. Mix, then add the beaten 
egg yolks. 

3. Add both the egg yolks and cheese to the slightly cooled white sauce. 
Mix. 

Compare the volume, tendency to shrink, and texture of the souffles. What 
temperature should the white sauce be when the cheese is added? Would this 
vary with different kinds of cheese, that is loaf, processed, and cheddar? Would 
it vary with degree of ripeness or dryness of the cheese? What is a desirable 
method of making and baking cheese souffle? 



CHAPTER X 



EGG COOKERY 



Structure and composition. The shell forms about 11 per cent of 
the egg and is largely composed of calcium carbonate with some mag- 
nesium carbonate, calcium and magnesium phosphates, and organic matter. 




Century Photos, Inc. 



Fig. 32. — Showing standing up quality of yolk and white of a fresh and a 
deteriorated egg. 

Within the shell is the shell membrane, a thin, semi-permeable membrane 
made up of two layers, the inner and outer. After the egg is laid, its con- 
tents cool and shrink. The air cell at the large end of the egg is formed 
during this shrinkage by separation of the two membranes. 

For cookery purposes the white and yolk are the important parts of the 
egg. The white is clear, transparent, and jelly-like. It composes about 57 
per cent of the weight of the whole egg. The layer next the shell is a thin

soft white, its relative proportion varying somewhat at time of laying. 
Fig. 32. Next comes a layer of rather thick, viscous white, containing a 
larger proportion of mucin than the thin white. Beyond this is a small 
layer of thin white surrounding the yolk. Schaible, Moore, and Davidson 
say that the thick, "firm white is of laminated structure, composed of 
concentric layers containing mucin fibers." If a freshly laid egg is broken

into a large quantity of distilled water (the thick white having been slit 
with scissors on one side to remove yolk) and allowed to stand, the mucin 
and probably some globulin are precipitated at the edge of the cut surface. 
Six or more sheets or layers, one over the other, can be distinctly seen. 
Fig. 33. 

The chalazae are dense cord-like strands of white substance, one on each 
side of the yolk, which anchor the yolk near the center of the egg. They 
allow the yolk to revolve. Being dense the chalazae are not broken down 
readily when the egg is beaten, hence they are often caught on the blades 
or wires of the egg beater. 



COLOR OF SHELL AND YOLK 



325 



The yolk forms about 32 per cent of the whole egg. It is separated from 
the white by a yolk sac, called the vitelline membrane. The yolk is made 
up of layers. See Fig. 34. The fat is more concentrated around the germ 
spot; hence its specific gravity is less and when the egg is turned the yolk 
rotates so that the germ spot is always uppermost. In eggs of average size 
the white usually averages about 30 grams and the yolk about 18 grams. 

Composition. The composition of the white is approximately 86.2 per 
cent water; 12.3 per cent protein; 0.2 per cent fat; and 0.6 per cent

mineral. The composition of the yolk is about 49.5 per cent water; 33.3 
per cent fats, including lecithin and cholesterol; 15.7 per cent proteins; and 
1.0 per cent minerals. 

Color of shell and yolk.- The color of the shell is determined by 
inheritance, certain breeds laying white, others brown-colored shells. The 
Barnaveldters lay eggs with nearly chocolate-brown shells. 

The coloring matter of the yolk, according to Palmer, Mattikow, and 
others is xanthophyll, with a small proportion of a carotene-like pigment. 
The intensity of the yolk color is determined by the amount of xanthophyll 
in the food of the hen. The color of the yolk may vary from a very pale, 
almost white yolk, through deeper yellows to orange and finally a deep- 
red-orange. Some feeds may produce red-colored yolks. Some attempts 
have been made to work out color charts, giving each shade a number ; but 
most of these are only tentative. It is an advantage for bakers and mayon- 
naise manufacturers to obtain yolks of uniform color to insure uniformity 



326 EGG COOKERY 

of color of their products. A small number of manufacturers at present do 
specify the color of the egg yolks when they place their contract for them. 
Reaction of eggs. 1 he egg white is alkaline. Sharp found that the 
pH of the white varies from 7.6 to 9.7, whereas the yolk of fresh eggs 
averages pH 6.0 or slightly lower. The pH of both the white and yolk 
increases with age because of the loss of carbon dioxide. Sharp and Powell 
state that since the loss of some carbon dioxide cannot be prevented before 
the pH is taken, that a pH of 7.6 is probably too high for freshly laid eggs. 
With further loss of carbon dioxide the pH may increase to 9.5. Then, 
probably owing to break down of some of the egg protein, the pH decreases. 
The />H of the yolk may reach 6.8, but changes more gradually than that 
of the white. When the whole egg is beaten so that the white and yolk are 
mixed, a pH. intermediate between that of the white and yolk is obtained. 

Egg Quality 

The term "quality" as applied to eggs refers ultimately to their desir- 
ability for human consumption. When an egg deteriorates its cooking 
qualities are altered. It is commonly accepted that an egg of high quality 
is better for poaching, boiling, and frying than one of inferior quality. At 
present, for trade use, eggs of quality are defined as those having a rela- 
tively high percentage of thick to thin white, and a high percentage of yolk 
solids. These eggs, when broken on a flat surface, do not tend to flatten 
out as quickly nor to so great an extent as eggs of poorer quality. See 
Fig. 32. 

Tests for quality. A candler's grading of the egg is based largely on 
the size of the air cell and the visibility of the yolk. Perry found that yolk 
color, ascertained after breaking the egg, influences the yolk shadow and 
the 3'olk movement, as determined in candling. The dark yolks cause a 
darker shadow and increase the apparent movement, though the percentage 
of thick albumen did not influence the yolk shadow and movement. The 
air cell increases in size with loss of water from the egg. The less the 
humidity of the air in which the egg is stored, the greater the loss of water. 
When water is lost to the outside air the total solids of the egg increase. 
The changes in the cooking quality of the white and yolk may not be so 
detrimental as when the w\ater loss is prevented. Since the size of the air 
cell increases with the loss of water, the humidity of storage rooms is 
usually controlled to prevent a large moisture loss. But other changes, more 
detrimental to the quality of the egg than water loss, may occur. 

Almquist, Givens, and Klose say that the transmission of light varies 
for different layers of egg albumen, being lowest for the firmest or gelat- 
inous layers. They find the transmission of light to be correlated with the 
percentage of mucin in the albumen. In addition it varies with the tem- 
perature and pH, both of which affect the physical condition of the mucin. 



FACTORS AFFECTING QUALITY OF EGGS 327 

At lower temperatures and at lower pH the translucency of the mucin 
fibers is lessened. 

Wilcke used a torsion pendulum to measure externally the interior 
viscosity of an egg and from observations worked out an index K, which 
was a measure of the combined viscosity of the entire contents of the egg. 
He found that the K value increased with increased weight of the eggs, 
but that the rations used did not affect the K values of the eggs produced 
by hens on the rations used in his study. The index, K, is a characteristic 
of the individual hen. 

Standing-up quality of the yolk. Sharp has worked out a system of 
determining the quality of the egg from the standing-up ability of the 
yolk. If a fresh egg of good quality is broken out of the shell, the yolk 
stands up. But as the interior quality deteriorates the yolk flattens out 
more and more readily until a stage is reached at which the yolk membrane 
breaks, no matter how carefully handled, when the shell is broken. Both 
the time the yolk is on the dish and its temperature affect the extent of 
flattening, the flattening being greater with longer time and a higher 
temperature. By dividing the height of the yolk by its width a numerical 
index is obtained that indicates the quality of the egg. The measurements 
of the yolk, after being freed of the white, taken 5 minutes after it is laid 
on the Petri dish and at a temperature of 25°C., give an average value of 
about 0.41 for eggs 3 to 4 hours old. With deterioration of the egg the 
index becomes less, and breaking occurs when the index falls to about 0.25. 

The standing-up ability of the white may also be used to determine 
egg quality. 

Vitelline membrane strength. Another method for determining quality is 
to measure the strength of the vitelline membrane. The average thickness 
of this membrane has been reported to be about 64/100,000 of an inch. In 
a fresh egg its bursting strength is about 0.065 pounds per square inch. 
With deterioration the strength of the membrane decreases and the yolk 
breaks easily when the strength has fallen to a little over half this value. 

Factors affecting quality of eggs. Fresh-laid eggs vary in propor- 
tions and viscosity of the thin and thick white. The yolk membrane also 
varies in strength. These variations are probably due to feed, the season 
of the year, the period of the laying cycle, and individual characteristics of 
the hen. It has already been mentioned that Wilcke found that the rations 
did not influence the viscosity of the egg in his investigations, but he states 
his work does not rule out this factor. Lorenz and Almquist report that 
the percentage of firm white is lowered by higher air temperature during 
the hours immediately after the egg is laid, resulting in an apparent seasonal 
variation in internal egg quality. The poorer quality of eggs obtained during 
summer months is attributed to the higher temperature during this season. 
The finest quality eggs are claimed to be those laid in the spring, which 
coincides with the time of greatest production. 



328 EGG COOKERY 

Preservation and deterioration of eggs. Sharp states that "as soon 
as the egg leaves the hen it begins to decline in interior quality and the best 
we can hope to do is to retard these changes as much as possible. They 
cannot be stopped, they can only be retarded. An egg a week old may have 
deteriorated more in quality than an egg properly cared for which is a 
year old." 

Eggs are preserved by (1) storing at low temperatures, (2) by freezing, 
(3) by drying, and (4) by oil dipping. 

Storing at low temperatures. In commercial storage the temperature, 
humidity, and air currents are controlled, the last to prevent mold growth. 
A high moisture content in the storage air lessens the amount of the water 
evaporated from the egg, but encourages mold growth. The storage tem- 
perature is usually maintained at 29° to 30°F. In addition chemical control 
of the atmosphere is frequently practised in the storage rooms. Stewart and 
Sharp state that at 30°F., if 0.6 per cent carbon dioxide is used, the /)H 
of the egg white will be maintained at 8.0 to 8.1. If the concentration of 
carbon dioxide is too high, the white becomes turbid, but loses this turbidity 
after loss of some carbon dioxide from the egg on breaking. 

Most of the eggs placed in low temperature storage are stored during 
March, April, May, and June. More than half of the annual supply of 
eggs is laid during these four months. Withdrawal of eggs from storage 
usually begins in August, reaches its peak about November, and the supply 
is generally exhausted by January. 

Frozen eggs. The use of frozen eggs has increased very rapidly in the last 
10 years. The eggs are broken out of the shell for freezing, which gives 
an opportunity for increasing contamination with bacteria. If eggs are frozen 
quickly after being broken, little bacterial growth takes place. Swenson 
and James found that fewer organisms survived quick freezing than delayed 
slow freezing. They also report that the addition of carbon dioxide to the 
egg batter just prior to freezing was detrimental to survival of bacteria. 
Eggs are frozen whole, the whites and yolks being mixed by beating. The 
whites and yolks are also frozen separately. Freezing alters the physical 
characteristics of the yolk, as it is more viscous after defrosting. Hence to 
prevent its becoming so stiff and gummy that it does not mix readily with 
other ingredients, before being frozen it is beaten and a small percentage 
of salt, sugar, particularly dextrose, or some suitable edible ingredient is 
often added. Some of these processes are patented, and the proportion of 
ingredients added as well as the manner of incorporation are not generally 
known. 

Frozen whole eggs, egg yolks, and egg whites are usually prepared in 
30-pound lots, though some 10-pound lots are frozen. A pound of frozen 
whole eggs is equivalent to about 10 fresh eggs. As yet frozen eggs are 
not on the retail market. 

Drying. The use of dried eggs is decreasing in the United States, the 
frozen eggs taking their place in many products. 



I 



FACTORS CAUSING DETERIORATION 329 

Oil dipping. Oil dipping, shell treating, or processing of eggs is increas- 
ing rapidly. This process consists of dipping the egg in some kind of oil to 
seal the pores of the egg shell, thus retaining the carbon dioxide within 
the egg. 

Swenson, Slocum, and James report that a special white, odorless, taste- 
less mineral oil of right viscosity and low enough pour-point (40°F.) has 
been developed to be applied to the shell at temperatures of 60° to 80°F. 
They also state that oiling shell eggs, especially by the vacuum-carbon 
dioxide method, tends to maintain the pH of the egg white at 7.9 =^ 0.3, 
which is below the optimum for proteolytic activity. Sharp and Wagenen 
state that if eggs are oil dipped fairly soon after they are laid, the white 
will have a pH value of 8.0 or less at the end of the storage period. If oil 
dipping is to be of value in preserving the eggs they must be dipped before 
too much carbon dioxide has escaped. 

Factors causing deterioration. The causes for deterioration of eggs 
may be listed as follows: (1) action of the enzyme trypsin, (2) alkaline 
hydrolysis, and (3) chemical changes and changes due to bacterial action. 
The changes brought about by these factors may be speeded up or retarded 
by temperature and reaction. 

Enzyme action. Balls and Swenson report that trypsin, a proteolytic 
enzyme, is found only in the thick white. Its action, i.e., protein splitting, 
which reduces the proportion of thick white in the egg, is speeded up by 
increase in temperature, its greatest activity occurring near body tempera- 
ture. Sharp has found that the weakening of the yolk membrane is greater 
in 2 days at 98.6°F. for eggs stored in air containing ordinary amounts of 
carbon dioxide and at 80 per cent humidity than after 5 days of storage 
at 77°, or 20 days of storage at 60.8°, or 100 days of storage at 35.6°F. 
Likewise a />H of about 9.25 may be reached in 2 days at 37°C., in 5 days 
at 16°, and in 10 days at 2°C. Or, in other words, carbon dioxide escapes 
more slowly and enzyme action is also slower at lower temperatures. The 
reaction of trypsin is also speeded up as the reaction becomes more alkaline, 
the optimum activity according to Swenson, Slocum, and James occurring 
at pH 8.4 to 8.8. Thus with loss of carbon dioxide from the egg, the action 
of the trypsin is increased. Balls and Swenson found that the action of the 
trypsin is decidedly speeded up by injecting enterokinase into the thick 
white, which also gives proof that the enzyme is trypsin, since enterokinase 
activates only trypsin. The thin white contains an anti-trypsin which inhibits 
the action of the trypsin. Therefore, when the thick and thin white are 
mixed together the action of the trypsin is inhibited. This mixing of the 
thick and thin white before freezing may be one reason for the claim made 
by many users of frozen eggs that frozen eggs are superior to and more 
uniform in quality than fresh eggs. Balls and Swenson state the amount 
of trypsin varies greatly in individual eggs of the same lot. 

Alkaline hydrolysis. Alkaline hydrolysis of proteins, the breaking down 
of the protein into smaller units, is also speeded up as the egg becomes more 



330 EGG COOKERY 

alkaline by loss of carbon dioxide and as the temperature increases. Alkaline 
hydrolysis of protein occurs independently of enzyme action. 

Chemical changes and changes due to bacterial action. Slow chemical 
breakdown may cause off flavors and changes in eggs, but true rotting of 
eggs is caused by microorganisms. 

Eggs which are infected with a large number of molds and bacteria 
ordinarily do not keep well. Microorganisms cannot always be detected in 
eggs in the shell, yet the eggs deteriorate in storage. But, in general, eggs 
with clean shells are comparatively free from bacteria. Reetger found that 
not over 4 per cent, and usually a smaller number, of eggs with clean shells 
were infected with bacteria. Egg shells vary in porosity and some eggs 
have a few very large pores. Infection with bacteria is easier through these 
large pores. Eggs having dirt on the shell are most easily infected. Bryant 
and Sharp report that washing of such eggs is not the cause for deteriora- 
tion, if they are handled properly after washing. The deterioration of 
washed eggs is caused by bacterial infection of the egg from the dirt on 
the shell. 

Changes in eggs with deterioration. The most important changes 
occurring in eggs during deterioration are : ( 1 ) the thick white becomes 
less viscous and jelly-like, gradually changing to a thin watery white. (2) 
Water passes from the white to the yolk increasing the size and fluid 
content of the yolk, thus decreasing the yolk solids. In addition the yolk 
membrane weakens and, if the weakening has progressed far enough, breaks 
when the shell is opened. (3) Loss of moisture usually occurs. (4) The 
egg may absorb foreign or off odors. (5) With continuous loss of carbon 
dioxide the alkalinity of the egg increases. 

Properties of Egg Proteins 

The extensive use of eggs in cookery is made possible by their protein 
content. The protein coagulates during heating, thus bringing about 
thickening as in custards or the binding of pieces of food together as in 
croquettes. The proteins of the egg are good emulsifying agents. The pro- 
teins form elastic films when beaten, thus incorporating air, which is used 
as leavening in such products as angel cakes and souffles. The elasticity of 
the egg protein is also important in products such as popovers where the 
egg stretches with expansion of steam, and later coagulates to aid in form- 
ing the framework of the popover. 

The proteins of the egg. The proteins of the white are ovoalbumin, 
ovoglobulin, and ovomucin. There may be small amounts of other proteins 
and it is also possible that each protein is made up of component fractions. 
Hughes and Scott give the relative proportions of the proteins in the three 
portions of the white as shown in Table 41. 

The principal protein of the yolk is ovovitellin. Sell, Olsen, and Kremers

separated salted egg yolk into a soluble lipoid fraction and an insoluble 
residue. The latter consisted of sodium chloride and the protein-like mate- 
rial of the yolk. This residue they called lecitho-protein. It composed about 
32.5 per cent of the yolk. This protein fraction contained nearly one-half 
the total lecithin of the yolk. 

Solubility o£ the proteins. The albumin of egg forms a sol with 
water and dilute salt solutions. The globulin forms a sol in dilute salt solu- 
tions, but not in pure water. The globulin composes about 6.5 per cent of 
the total proteins of the egg. 

Egg-white proteins belong to the group of hydrophilic colloids. Egg 
white and water are mutually soluble. Usually the addition of 1 table- 
spoon of water to an egg white, unless it is very watery, increases its ex- 
tensibility, and when the egg white is whipped a larger volume is obtained. 
But with increasing quantities of water a stage is reached at which the 
egg white loses too much of its rigidity and will no longer retain air in 
small bubbles, the bubbles being large and floating on the more liquid 
part. 

The ovovitellin of the egg yolk is combined with phosphorus and be- 
longs to the phosphoprotein group. It is insoluble in water but is soluble 
in dilute salt solutions and in dilute alkalies. 

Isoelectric point of egg proteins. Loeb has reported the isoelectric 
point of egg albumin as ^H 4.8. Some investigators give />H 4.7 as the 
isoelectric point. Above the isoelectric point the albumin combines with 
bases to form salts like sodium albuminate; below the isoelectric point it 
combines with acids to form salts like albumin acetate, citrate, or tartrate. 
Above the isoelectric point the protein is negatively charged ; below, it is 
positively charged. Since the reaction of the egg white is about /»H 7.6 to 
9, there will probably be few combinations of egg white with alkalies or 
alkaline salts in food preparation that will increase its alkalinity. Many 
combinations are made that increase its acidity. For example, the addition 
of a teaspoon of cream of tartar, a salt with an acid reaction, to a cup of 



332 EGG COOKERY 

egg whites, proportions often used in angel food cakes, increases the acidity 
and lowers the pH, often to about 7.5 or 7.0. As the proportion of cream 
of tartar is increased, the pH is lowered to a greater extent. The addition 
of fruit juices and fruit pulp to egg whites to make fruit whip, souffles, or 
similar desserts, increases the acidity. When 1 to 2 teaspoons of lemon juice 
are added to an egg white the pH is lower than 4.8. 

No record could be found in the literature of the isoelectric point of 
ovovitellin. When lemon juice is added to egg yolk, the mixture is thickest 
at a pH between 4 and 5, as if the greatest tendency to curdle is at this 
point. This might indicate that the isoelectric point of the egg yolk proteins 
is between pH 4 and 5. This greatest thickening occurs with about 5 cc. of 
lemon juice to an egg yolk. 

The addition of an acid like vinegar or fruit juice to the white and yolk 
beaten together tends to curdle the mixture. This occurs when the acidity 
is in the vicinity of the isoelectric point. When sufficient acid is added to 
lower the pH below the isolectric point of the egg proteins, and if the salt 
formed, such as protein citrate, is soluble, the coagulum dissolves and the 
mixture becomes smooth. With the exception of salad dressings and a few 
sauces, there are probably not many instances in which enough acid is 
added to lower the pH of the food mixture below the isoelectric point of 
the egg protein. 

Peptization of egg proteins. Peptization of egg proteins increases 
the tenderness of some products. Freundlich states that peptization of pro- 
teins is frequently brought about by low concentrations of electrolytes, 
though to accomplish this the electrolyte must be intimately mixed with 
the substance to be peptized. The hydroxyl, citrate, acetate, and tar- 
trate ions are effective for peptizing egg proteins. For example, when 
tomato or lemon juice is added to egg in amounts to bring the pH of the 
egg slightly above or about the isoelectric point of egg albumin, the tender- 
ness of omelets is definitely increased. In some instances peptization of the 
egg proteins is detrimental. An example of this is the thinning of salad 
dressings, thickened with only egg yolk, when heated above the temperature 
at which optimum coagulation occurs. 

Sugars (sucrose, dextrose, and levulose) through peptization tend to 
prevent coagulation of egg protein. 

Denaturation. Denaturation, by which soluble proteins are rendered 
insoluble, of egg proteins is brought about in a variety of ways, including 
the action of acids, salts, heat, mechanical agitation, and radiation. Mechan- 
ical agitation or beating of egg white, as well as the tendency of proteins 
in surfaces to form films, causes partial denaturation of the egg proteins. 
Sugar tends to prevent this denaturation. 

The theories for heat coagulation have been considered in Chapter I. 
But, however the process of coagulation is brought about, the coagulation 
temperature, the time required for coagulation, and the factors that cause 



HEAT COAGULATION OF EGG PROTEINS 333 

variation in coagulation temperature are of interest in egg cookery, because 
they determine the temperature to which certain dishes, such as custards 
and cooked salad dressings, may be heated. If heated beyond this point, 
separation into solid and liquid may result and curdling occurs, or the salad 
dressing may become thinner. 

Coagulation temperature of egg white. Undiluted egg white coagu- 
lates at about 60 °C. or becomes jelly-like at this temperature. Coagulation 
may start at a slightly lower temperature, but the amount coagulated at 
the lower temperature depends on how long the egg is held at that point. 
In coagulating, the egg white changes from a clear, transparent mass to a 
white and opaque one. If the egg white is heated slowly, a point is reached 
— about 62°C. — at which it will not flow in a test tube. It is still firmer 
at 64° to 65 °C. In cooking, the temperature is seldom held a long time 
at a definite degree but may rise gradually and often rapidly. 

Coagulation temperature o£ the egg yolk. The egg yolk requires a 
higher temperature for coagulation than the egg white. It begins to thicken 
at about 65 °C. but does not reach a stage at which it does not flow until 
about 70°. Since the yolk does not change color during coagulation it is 
more difficult to determine when it is coagulated. 

When the white and yolk are mixed by beating and are heated slowly 
the mass begins to thicken at 65°C. and becomes stiffer not far from 70°. 

Factors affecting heat coagulation of egg proteins. The follow- 
ing factors affect the coagulation temperature of the egg proteins : ( 1 ) 
temperature, (2) time, (3) concentration of protein, (4) salt content and 
its concentration, (5) reaction of the egg solution or mixture, and (6) 
sugar. 

Temperature and time. The rate of coagulation increases with increas- 
ing temperature. At high temperatures it is so rapid that it seems nearly 
instantaneous. Eggs cooked in boiling water will cook at a much faster 
rate or in a shorter time than those cooked in water at 70 °C. Chick and 
Martin have found that "heat coagulation is a reaction with a high tem- 
perature coefficient, the reaction velocity of which varies considerably with 
different proteins and according to the acidity and saline content of the 
solution." They have reported that the temperature coefficient for crystal- 
line egg albumin in water solution and 1 per cent concentration is 1.9 
times for 1°C. rise in temperature. The temperature coefficient is greater 
than 2 for the results of Lepeschkin given below. In cooking eggs or foods 
containing large proportions of egg, the amount of coagulum formed at 
a definite temperature depends upon the length of time the food is held at 
the specified temperature and the number of degrees the specified tempera- 
ture is above the point at which coagulation may begin. Using filtered egg 
white, Lepeschkin found that, with water at a definite temperature, a 
longer time was required before the egg appeared turbid at lower tempera- 
tures than at higher temperatures. His findings may be summarized :

As the temperature of milk custards is elevated the firmness of the 
custard is increased. At a definite temperature, depending on the rate of 
heating, an optimum consistency is obtained. Heating to a temperature 
higher than this increases syneresis and porosity of the custard. 

Woodruff and Meyer found that by increasing the temperature from 
79° to 91° by 4° intervals the strength, when tested by a gel tester of 
distilled-water-egg custard gels with 0.2 M and 0.05 M sodium chloride 
and 0.2 M magnesium chloride plus 23 per cent sugar, was increased. But 
at the higher temperatures the gels were porous and undesirable. The con- 
centration of egg used was approximately 2 to a cup of liquid. 

Co?icentration. Robertson states, "The concentration of the protein, and 
especially the presence of other substances in the solution, very markedly 
affects the coagulation temperature." This is illustrated in egg cookery. 
The whole egg coagulates at a temperature not far from 70 °C. When 1 
to 2 tablespoons of milk or water are added, as in the making of plain 
omelets, coagulation occurs at a temperature above 70°C. When 1 egg is 
added to a cup of milk the coagulation temperature is much higher than 
that of egg alone. It is about 80°C., the amount coagulated at a definite 
temperature depending upon the rate of heating. If 2 eggs are added to a 
cup of milk the concentration of egg is greater than when 1 is used, and 
coagulation under the same conditions for heating occurs at a slightly lower 
temperature. 

Salts. The salt content of the egg or of the material with which the egg 
is combined affects the coagulation of the egg proteins. Lepeschkin has 
shown that, if egg albumin is dialyzed so that the mineral content is low- 
ered, the albumin does not coagulate on heating. He has also shown that 
coagulation varies with the salt concentration, that some concentrations 
cause coagulation and others do not. However, if, to the heated egg al- 
bumin that has been dialyzed, salts are added, coagulation takes place, 
but this often requires a definite concentration for maximum coagulation, 
higher or lower concentrations not being so effective or failing to bring 
about coagulation. 

The effect of the salt content on coagulation can be shown by com- 
bining egg as for custard, but substituting distilled water for the milk, 
which when heated to 83° to 86°C. does not gel. If to this distilled-water 
custard a definite concentration of a salt is added, coagulation will occur 
on heating. Salts which will bring about coagulation are iron lactate, ferric 



I 



pH AND COAGULATION OF CUSTARD 335 

chloride, calcium chloride, sodium chloride, aluminum chloride, aluminum 
sulfate, sodium sulfate, magnesium sulfate, sodium acetate, potassium 
tartrate, sodium potassium tartrate, calcium phosphate (monobasic and 
secondary), sodium and potassium phosphate. However, some produce a 
firmer coagulum than others, for with each salt a definite concentration 
brings about optimum coagulation. If the distilled-water custard is heated 
to 83°-86° before the salt is added, and the salt is then added, coagulation 
occurs; but when the mixture is stirred, curdling occurs to a greater or 
lesser extent. A milk-salt mixture, such as the Sherman or Steenbock formu- 
las used in animal-feeding experiments, in the right concentration forms a 
coagulum in distilled-water custards that is similar in consistency to that 
produced by milk custards. 

Concentration and valence of added salts. If the effect of electrolytes 
upon hydrophobic and hydrophilic colloids is referred to in Chapter I, the 
statement is found that the precipitation of the protein is brought about 
by the ion having the opposite charge from that of the protein. In general, 
the coagulating power of the ion increases with increasing valence, but 
there are some exceptions to this rule, some monovalent ions being more ef- 
fective than some polyvalent ions. In many cases there is a zone of maximum 
coagulating effect. The effect of the concentration of the salt upon the 
coagulation of the egg can be shown in the following way. If less than 1/16 
teaspoon of ferric or aluminum chloride is added to an egg, a cup of distilled 
water and 2 tablespoons of sugar, the custard coagulates on heating to 84°C., 
though the coagulum is not so firm as when milk is used. However, if a 
larger quantity of ferric or aluminum chloride is added to the mixture, 
about ]/^ teaspoon or more, the custard does not coagulate when heated to 
84° C. The reaction of the custard mixture with the small amount of 
aluminum or ferric chloride given above is slightly acid to litmus, and 
the larger quantities are decidedly acid to litmus. Hence, the larger quantity 
of ferric chloride must peptize the egg proteins. 

Woodruff and Meyer found that sodium chloride, sodium sulfate, and 
calcium chloride, when used in 0.2 M concentration, produced gels of 
approximately equal strength and slightly weaker gels than milk. Mag- 
nesium chloride and sodium thiocyanate produced stronger gels than milk. 
They concluded that the difference in strength of gels formed by various 
electrolytes seemed to be a specific function of the cation and anion of 
the salt, and independent of the /»H of the solution. Increasing the concentra- 
tion of each salt gave gels of greater strength until a maximum strength was 
reached, after which further increases of the salt reduced the gel strength. 

The relation of reaction to setting of custards. If hydrochloric acid is 
added to the egg-distilled-water custard, so that the reaction is adjusted to 
a /»H above the isoelectric point of egg albumin, pH 4.8, coagulation occurs 
within the range of pH 5 to 6. The coagulum is soft and not quite so firm 



336 EGG COOKERY 

as when salts are added, but it shows that a definite acidity tends to aid 
coagulation. 

The coagulation of egg-distilled-water custard with added salt is some- 
what similar to the jellying of fruit jells in that it occurs at a definite 
range of pH. 

Coagulation occurs over a wider range of pH when milk is used with 
the egg than when distilled water is used. If the pH is adjusted with 
hydrochloric acid and sodium hydroxide, it occurs from pH 0.2 to 8.6 or 
over even wider ranges. The reaction of a milk-egg custard mixture, with 
no added acid or alkali, is between pH 6 to 7 with an average of about 
6.5. This custard mixture was made up in a large quantity, and divided 
into different portions. To these portions hydrochloric acid or sodium hy- 
droxide was added to adjust the custard to the desired pH. As the pH 
was lowered the firmness of the custard increased, until at about pH 5 
curdling occurred. All custards with a pH below 5 curdled, the curd be- 
coming very fine in texture, and forming a dense layer in the bottom of 
the container. This layer decreased in amount as the pH was lowered 
below the isoelectric point of egg albumin. At a pH 0.2 the custard was 
badly charred, and the curd was very slight and fine, the custard quite soft. 
With increased alkalinity above pH 6.5 the coagulum was less firm. The 
custards could be placed in the order of acidity by the depth of color: the 
greater the acidity the lighter the color, the greater the alkalinity the 
deeper the color. The color ranged from light cream, through yellow, to a 
deep orange-yellow. 

Acids. Chick and Martin state that acid solution hastens the second 
part of the heat-coagulation process, that is, the clotting or coagulation, 
but does not hasten the first part of the process, the denaturation. They 
have reported that acid accelerates the rate of coagulation. They state 
that the influence of acid in accelerating the coagulation rate of a neutral 
solution is at first relatively small, but with each successive addition of acid 
its influence becomes disproportionately greater. Loeb using isoelectric crys- 
talline egg albumin in a 1 per cent solution at a /)H 4.8 found that it 
coagulated at a temperature not far from 60°C. When acid was added 
and the /)H lowered to 4.39 the coagulation did not occur until about 
80°C. With pH 4.25 coagulation did not occur at 95°C. 

Fruits that do not have a high acidity such as dates and figs may be 
used in custards and tend to give a firmer custard, because they lower the 
/)H slightly. More acid fruits, such as lemon juice, cannot be used in 
very large quantities. The addition of quite acid fruit juices tends not only 
to coagulate the casein and albumin but also to hasten curdling. Custards 
that are made of milk that is slightly sour will curdle more readily during 
heating. If the acidity has not reached the stage at which curdling occurs, 
the custard is firmer. 

Alkalies. Chick and Martin have found that in alkaline solution the 
second part of the coagulation process, the aggregation or coagulation of 



CUSTARDS 337 

the protein, does not occur. If after heating the alkali is neutralized with 
acid, coagulation occurs. Thus, if enough of an alkali or of an alkaline 
salt is added to a custard to render the solution sufficiently alkaline, the 
custard will not coagulate on heating. But if acidified after heating the 
custard will **set." 

Sugar. The addition of the non-electrolyte sugar to an egg mixture ele- 
vates both the setting and curdling temperatures. In large enough quantities 
it tends to prevent both coagulation and curdling. Its effect in preventing 
coagulation appears to be proportional to the amount added, the greater 
the amount added the greater the difficulty in bringing about coagulation. 
Bancroft and Rutzler state that a "l5-per cent egg white sol was not 
prevented from coagulating by the addition of 0.25 gram of dextrose to 
10 cc. of the sol. However, when the sol was saturated with respect to 
dextrose heating in boiling water caused no coagulation." 

Woodruff and Meyer found that 10 per cent of sucrose reduced the gel 
strength of egg-milk custards heated to 83 °C., approximately one-half. Add- 
ing 30 per cent of sugar practically prevented coagulation. Adding sugar 
also increased the translucency of the custard. 

In the salad-dressing recipe given in Experiment 65, increasing the sugar 
from Yi to 11 tablespoons (140 grams, about 30 per cent) elevates the 
temperature for optimum thickness about 4° to 6°C. Here in spite of the 
fact that the acid tends to lower the coagulation temperature the effect of 
the large quantity of sugar is still greater and the mixture must be cooked 
to a higher temperature for optimum thickening. 

Coagulation by other means. Flosdorf and Chambers found that audible 
sound, frequencies (1000-15,000), coagulated solutions of egg albumin and 
synthetic plasterin almost instantly at 30 °C. 

Jellinek placed a raw egg between two condenser plates connected to a 
short-wave radio transmitter. After power of 1000 watts had been applied 
for 5 minutes, the egg yolk was coagulated and hard, as if it had been 
cooked, but the white was scarcely affected. The temperature of the yolk 
at the end of this period was 140°F., that of the white was 176°F. 

The Applications of Factors Affecting Heat Coagulation 
to Preparation o£ Food Products 

Custards. As can be deduced from the foregoing discussion, custards 
containing a high proportion of sugar may not thicken satisfactorily for 
serving purposes. A small amount of salt aids setting but too much in- 
creases the tendency to curdle. 

Pie fillings. One question often asked is why butterscotch fillings for 
pies which are of a consistency for serving sometimes become thin and runny 
after standing for a short time. This of course is different from the instances 
in which thickening does not occur. There may be various factors that bring 
about this result, but the effect of the sugar in elevating the temperature 



338 EGG COOKERY 

at which egg coagulates is one explanation. The proportion of sugar in 
butterscotch fillings in different recipes varies from about 15 to 25 per 
cent, or 15 to 25 grams per 100 grams of filling. A usual procedure is to 
cook the sugar, cornstarch or flour, and scalded milk until thick. This 
mixture is often added to the beaten yolks by stirring the hot mixture 
into the yolks. Sometimes it is considered that the hot milk mixture will 
coagulate or cook the egg yolk sufficiently. However, if the temperature 
drops below 80°C. during this procedure and the mixture is not reheated 
the egg yolks will not be cooked sufficiently. The filling appears thick at 
the time, but on standing it becomes runny. If sugar is added to uncooked 
egg yolks, mixed, and left to stand for a few minutes the mixture appears 
thinner and more runny. If the yolks are not cooked sufficiently they act 
in much the same way, the sugar dissolving in the uncooked yolk and the 
filling becoming runny. This has never been observed by the author if 
the mixture is heated to a sufficiently high temperature after the egg yolks 
are added. The same thing may occur in chocolate and lemon pie fillings, 
although this in some instances is due to not using enough starch, the action 
of the acid on the smaller amount of starch lessening the stiffness of the 
filling. Another possible cause is the tannin of the brow^n sugar, because 
the tannin has a dehydrating effect on many sols. But to date it has not 
been possible to obtain thinning in the butterscotch filling by adding slightly 
more tannin than might be found in the sugar. 

Baked products. The addition of sugar to egg in baked products also 
tends to delay coagulation or peptize the egg proteins and will be discussed 
further under angel cake and cakes containing fats. 

Cooked Salad Dressings 

Vinegar, lemon juice, or a mixture of the two, is used in cooked salad 
dressings. The two acids do not behave alike, particularly in regard to 
curdling. The lemon juice contains citric acid and salts. Vinegar contains 
acetic acid, and cider vinegar contains salts. If mustard, sugar, and salt 
are kept constant in the recipe given in Experiment 65 with 72 grams of 
egg yolk and a total of a cup of liquid, results similar to the following 
may be obtained, provided the rate of heating is the same in each case. The 
mixture is cooked in the upper part of a double boiler, 12 to 15 minutes 
being required for the cooking process.

COOKED SALAD DRESSINGS 339 

One-fourth cup of either the vinegar or lemon juice gives a stiffer or 
thicker dressing than ^ cup; ^ cup of vinegar or lemon juice gives a 
thicker dressing than ^ cup. These results seem to agree with those of 
Chick and Martin that acid aids coagulation. Increasing the quantity of 
acid lowers the temperature at which the consistency for serving is reached. 
The optimum dressing for serving is obtained at a temperature slightly 
higher than the temperature for ''coating the spoon." The salad dressings 
become thinner after heating above this optimum temperature for serving; 
the ones with lemon juice are thinner than those with the vinegar. An- 
other peculiarity is that if a portion of these salad dressings is cooked to 
as high a temperature as 92°C., all those made with vinegar may or may 
not curdle. The ones with lemon juice may not curdle, or those with the 
smaller quantity of lemon juice may curdle at about 85°C., but when 
heated to a higher temperature the curds may partially or entirely dis- 
appear. In all these instances the reaction of the dressings is probably below 
the isoelectric point of ovovitellin. If heated only to the temperature at 
which the dressings are thickest, the thinning is not noticeable if the dressing 
is stored. 

If 92 grams of whole egg are substituted for the egg yolk, the pH re- 
mains practically the same, but the dressing when cooked contains fine 
curds, those in the dressings made with lemon juice being finer than those 
in the ones made with vinegar. Increasing the proportion of salt produces 
a thicker product at a slightly lower temperature but one which curdles 
at a lower temperature. Increasing the sugar in the recipe slightly elevates 
the temperature at which the best texture for serving is obtained. 

The explanation for the salad dressing's becoming thin and nearly its 
original consistency when heated above the temperature at which the opti- 
mum thickening occurs is that the acid and continued application of heat 
bring about peptization of the protein. It is probably an illustration of a 
partial or complete reversibility of heat coagulation and one of the most 
common occurring in food preparation. It is probably the reason that usually 
only one or no recipe for boiled salad dressing containing only egg yolk 
as the thickening ingredient is given in most cook books. Too many cooks 
have had the salad dressing return to its original consistency. 

Salad dressing containing starch. If maximum thickening of both starch 
and egg is desired when these two ingredients are used together in a boiled 
salad dressing, the starch and all, or a part, of the liquid should be heated 
to 95 °C. or boiling before the egg is added. The maximum thickening of 
cornstarch does not occur below 91° and of wheat starch below 95°C. 
Since the maximum thickening of the egg in the presence of vinegar or 
lemon juice occurs at temperatures of 76° to 85 °C. and thinning occurs at 
higher temperature, this suggests that the thickened starch paste should 
be added to the cold beaten egg and then heated to a temperature that 
gives maximum thickening of the egg. 

On the other hand, there is the possibility that part of the egg protein 



340 EGG COOKERY 

may not coagulate in the presence of starch, hence not thicken the salad 
dressing. Bancroft and Rutzler, quoting Berlinsson, state that "albumin 
is prevented from coagulating even in boiling water by the presence of 
starch." However, this appears contrary to observed results in food prepara- 
tion. Possibly there needs to be a certain concentration of starch before 
coagulation is prevented or peptization of the egg protein may occur when 
heated above the temperature for coagulation of the egg protein. It will, 
at least, be an interesting point to investigate. 

Eggs Cooked in the Shell 

Effect of coagulation at low and high temperatures. Eggs cooked 
in water held at 70 °C. are not firm like those that are cooked in boiling 
water. The white cooked at 70°C. is very soft and jelly-like in consist- 
ency. The yolk held at this temperature for an hour or longer has the 
appearance of an uncooked yolk, but is more viscous, more waxy, thicker, 
and does not flow like the uncooked yolk. The color also remains more 
like that of the uncooked yolk, a deeper orange, instead of the yellow 
which is developed in eggs cooked at higher temperatures. The white of an 
egg cooked at least 12 minutes in boiling water is rather firm and may be 
tough. Eggs cooked at temperatures between 70° and 100°C. have tex- 
tures intermediate between the ones described above, i.e., they are firmer 
than the former and usually more tender than the latter. 

By cooking for a short time at a higher temperature the outer edge of 
the white may be firm to a depth depending on time of cooking, a portion 
near the yolk may be unchanged, and the yolk may be unchanged or the 
outer portion may be slightly cooked. 

The softer coagulum at the lower cooking temperature has been ex- 
plained as due to the effect of low temperature. Robertson suggests that it 
may be due to only partial coagulation of the protein at the low tem- 
perature. 

The white of some eggs is often more tender than that of other eggs 
cooked in the same lot. Perhaps this may be explained by the reaction, those 
which are more alkaline coagulating less readily. There is also the possibil- 
ity that the white of eggs cooked an extremely long time may become more 
tender. 

Barmore mixed egg white thoroughly and placed it in a cement briquette 
mold. The mold was immersed in water of the desired temperature and left 
40 minutes. The tensile strength and the depth a steel ball and rod would 
penetrate were determined. Below 77.5°C. the samples were too tender 
to handle. The three tests all indicated a decided increase in tenderness as 
the temperature of coagulation was reduced with the exception of the steel 
ball at 93° and 101 °C. Here the data indicated that the change may have 
decreased instead of increasing the toughness. The other tests gave opposite 
results at these temperatures.

Rate o£ heat penetration. The higher the temperature of the cooking 
water, the more rapid is the rate of heat penetration. As the temperature 
of the egg and water become more nearly equal the rate of heat trans- 
ference is very much slower, but the temperature at the center of the yolk 
even after cooking in boiling water for 4 hours or longer is never quite 
as high as that of the water, but is a fraction of a degree lower. 

Time required for cooking eggs in water. Since coagulation takes 
place at a definite rate, which increases with a rise in temperature, both 
the length of time the egg is left in the water and the temperature of the 
water affect the coagulation rate, and thus the time necessary for cooking. 
At a temperature just a little above the temperature at which coagulation 
of the white occurs, 60° to 65°C., a very long time is required to coagulate 
the mass of the egg white. If the cooking temperature is 70° or a little 
higher, more than an hour is required to coagulate the white and yolk. 
At a cooking temperature of 85° to 90°C. from 25 to 35 minutes are 
necessary to have the yolk the same consistency throughout. A shorter time 
leaves a portion of the egg yolk an orange color, instead of the uniform, 
powdery yellow. At the temperature of boiling water about 12 minutes 
are required to complete the cooking of the yolk uniformly. With increase 
in height above sea level these times are lengthened. 

The exact time of cooking at any given temperature depends upon the 
temperature of the egg when placed in the water, the quantity of water 
in relation to the size of the egg, and the rate of heating the water. 

Poached Eggs 

Fresh eggs are usually considered better for poaching than eggs in which 
the physical quality has deteriorated, i.e., eggs with watery whites. Class 
results substantiate this popular opinion, for eggs with thick viscous whites 
can be poached satisfactorily with far less care than those with thin whites. 
In poaching eggs it is desirable to have the temperature of the water near 
the boiling point when the egg is added. Thus the outer portion of the 
egg is coagulated in a short period of time. If desired, the cooking can 
be completed at a lower temperature. 

Since both the white and yolk tend to flatten on standing after being 
broken out of the shell, poached eggs of better appearance are usually 
obtained if the egg is broken just before it is added to the poaching water. 
St. John and Flor have reported that the thin portion of the white coagu- 
lates as satisfactorily as the thick portion if ^ teaspoon of salt to a pint of 
boiling water is used. The salt aids in coagulation. Eggs with about the 
same proportion of thick and thin parts of the white are firmer when poached 
in salted than in unsalted water. But for what food teachers call standard 
products, eggs poached in unsalted water often have a better appearance 
than those poached in salted water. The ones cooked in salted water are 
usually not so shiny. Occasionally the reverse is true. The added salt aids 



342 EGG COOKERY 

in coagulation, so that the thin portion of the white is less readily detached 
from the thicker portion. But the appearance of the thin portion after 
cooking in the salted water is often more puckered, wrinkled, and ruffled, 
or is in voluminous folds around the thicker coagulated part. This detracts 
from the appearance. Either a very hard water or a softened water is used 
for poaching eggs in class work. It is possible that the natural salt content 
of the water may effect coagulation, so that thin watery whites cooked in 
Ames's water do not give as good appearing products as those obtained by 
St. John and Flor. 

The Formation of Ferrous Sulfide in Cooked Eggs 

When an egg has been cooked in hot water for 15 minutes or longer a 
dark greenish color may be formed on the surface of the egg yolk. If the 
egg is immersed in cold water immediately after cooking, the green color 
is not produced or is less apparent than when the egg is left in the hot 
w^ater to cool slowly. 

The yolk contains most of the iron of the egg, about 85 times as much 
as the white. According to Sherman, the sulfur content of the white is 
slightly higher than that of the yolk, the white containing 0.214 per cent 
and the yolk 0.208 per cent. The sulfur of the white is more labile and 
more easily split off by heat than the sulfur of the yolk. Marlow and King 
say that the sulfur in egg whites and yolk is organically bound and that 
nearly all of it can be accounted for by the cystine and methionine sulfur. 

Tinkler and Soar have shown that the green color is due to the forma- 
tion of ferrous sulfide at the surface of the yolk. The white with prolonged 
heating at high temperatures evolves considerable quantities of hydrogen 
sulfide. The hydrogen sulfide combines with the iron of the yolk to form 
ferrous sulfide which produces the green color. The amount of hydrogen 
sulfide evolved depends on ( 1 ) the time of heating, (2) the temperature 
reached, and (3) the reaction of the egg. In a short cooking period little 
hydrogen sulfide is evolved. Likewise at a lower temperature a smaller 
amount of hydrogen sulfide is formed. Tinkler and Soar have also show^n 
that the formation of ferrous sulfide takes place very, very slowly until 
the yolk reaches a temperature of 70°C. It is very seldom formed in eggs 
cooked for 1 to 1^ hours at 70°C., or in eggs cooked 30 to 35 minutes 
at 85°C. Thus both the temperature attained by all or a portion of the egg 
white as well as the time held at this temperature influence the amount 
of hydrogen sulfide formed. In addition, as the reaction becomes more 
alkaline, the sulfur is split off more readily. Therefore, the extent of 
deterioration of the egg also affects the amount of hydrogen sulfide formed. 
This explains why some eggs have more ferrous sulfide formed than other 
eggs when cooked at the same time and cooled in the same manner. Tinkler 
and Soar have reported that the uncooked yolk is acid in reaction but upon 
being heated above 70° becomes alkaline. 



BAKED AND SOFT CUSTARDS 343 

Effect of rapid cooling upon formation of ferrous sulfide in 
cooked eggs. Hydrogen sulfide is a gas. When the egg is placed in cold 
water immediately after cooking the lowering of the temperature at the 
surface of the egg lowers the pressure there. One of the things learned in 
connection with the gas laws is that the pressure increases with increasing 
temperature. Since the white near the shell reaches a certain temperature 
more rapidly than the white near the yolk, more hydrogen sulfide is split 
off near the shell. But, since the temperature near the yolk is lower, hence 
has less pressure than near the shell, the hydrogen sulfide diffuses through 
the white towards the yolk. However, if the egg is placed immediately in 
cold water after cooking, the hydrogen sulfide diffuses to the surface of 
the egg, owing to the reduced pressure, but if left in hot water, or to cool 
in the air, the gas does not diffuse so quickly to the surface and ferrous 
sulfide is formed at the junction of the egg white and yolk. Tinkler and 
Soar have found that eggs cooked 15 minutes in boiling water and cooled 
slowly have some green color at the surface of the yolk; if cooled quickly, 
none or very little green color develops. Cooking in boiling water for 30 
minutes gives a great deal of green color, no matter how the eggs are 
cooled. Since the yolk contains iron and a fairly large quantity of sulfur, 
they wondered why the entire yolk did not turn green when cooked as long 
as 7 hours. They found the sulfur compounds in the yolk were more stable 
and less easily broken down to form hydrogen sulfide. Thus even with 
long cooking the color of the interior of the yolk is not changed. 

Custards 

In custards, eggs are combined with milk and sugar. The chief protein 
of cow's milk is casein, which is not coagulable by heat. Milk contains 
some albumin and a small proportion of globulin, which are coagulable by 
heat. Zoller states that the protein coagulable by heat is about 0.75 per 
cent of cow's milk. In the mixed milk and egg, the egg furnishes the larger 
percentage of the heat-coagulable protein. As the egg, milk, and sugar mix- 
ture is heated, coagulation occurs, and the thickened mixture is known as 
custard. If the temperature of the custard is carried a little higher than the 
coagulation point, a point is reached at which the custard begins to show 
syneresis, or the liquid separates from the curd. This is called the curdling 
point. 

Baked and soft custards. Custards may be cooked in two ways. They 
may be cooked without stirring. This type is usually baked in the oven 
and is called baked custard. The other tj^pe of custard is stirred continually 
while it is cooked and is called soft custard. If the proportion of ingredients 
in the custard are the same the one cooked without stirring is firmer in 
texture and appears to be in one piece or clot. The soft custard has a softer 
texture and is not in one piece but is a viscous fluid. 

The stirred custard also tends to curdle more readily than the baked 



344 EGG COOKERY 

custard. In part, this is undoubtedly because of the effect of mechanical 
agitation and is similar to the separation of fibrin of blood when beaten. 

Milk for custards is often heated before mixing with the egg and sugar. 
Forewarming of the milk may tend to prevent curdling of the milk, but 
the greatest advantage is probably in shortening the cooking period. 

Coagulation temperature of custards. The temperature at which 
a custard begins to coagulate or thicken is higher than the temperature at 
which the egg alone coagulates. The exact point at which coagulation starts 
is more difficult to ascertain than in the egg white, since the coagulation 
must be determined from the thickening of the custard. But not much 
occurs below 80°C. at ordinary rates of heating nor below 78°C. at slower 
rates of heating. As the soft custard coagulates, a thick layer will cling to 
a spoon that is dipped into the custard. In cookery this is known as ''coat- 
ing a spoon" and is one method of estimating when the custard is sufficiently 
cooked. The temperature at which coagulation starts varies with the vary- 
ing proportion of ingredients of the custard and the rate of cooking. In 
class results, the coagulation of a custard made of 1 cup of milk, 2 table- 
spoons of sugar, and 1 egg has never been perceptible below 78°C. and not 
at this temperature except when the rate of cooking is very slow. Occa- 
sionally a custard is heated slowly enough so that the best serving con- 
sistency occurs at 80°, provided the eggs are fresh so that the reaction has 
not become quite alkaline. 

It is possible to heat a cup of custard mixture in a double boiler from 
room temperature to the curdling point in less than 3 minutes. With this 
rapid rate of heating the custard is too thin to serve at 85° or even at 
87° to 89°, and generally curdles about 89°, often after the temperature 
has remained stationary at 89° for a time. It may reach 91° or 92° and 
then drop back to about 89°, the curdling occurring before a serving 
consistency is attained. 

When the custard is cooked more slowly, and particularly if the heat- 
ing is slow after 75°C. is reached, thickening is quite perceptible at 80°, 
it has a consistency for serving from 80° to 84° ; that cooked more slowly 
being thicker at the lower temperature. A slower rate of cooking is pref- 
erable to the rapid one. With the slower rate of cooking the thickening 
is evident for considerable time before the curdling point is reached. With 
the rapid cooking, the custard requires very close watching and rapid work 
to remove it from the heat before the curdling temperature is reached. 
Curdling may occur at 84° if the temperature is raised very slowly, but in 
ordinary cooking it is more likely to occur between 85° and 87°C. 

Coagulation and particularly curdling in custards is accompanied by 
absorption of heat. In the custards heated slowly the temperature is usu- 
ally stationary for a considerable period before curdling occurs. In the 
rapidly heated custards the temperature often reaches 90° to 92° and then 
drops as curdling occurs. 

The temperatures given in the following discussion are for custards 



CUSTARD PIE 345 

requiring 12 to 20 minutes from the time cooking is started to reach the 
curdling point. 

Concentration of egg and coagulation. If the proportion of egg 
in the custard is increased, thus increasing the concentration of the protein, 
coagulation starts at a slightly lower temperature, a firmer custard being 
obtained at a definite temperature as the proportion of egg is increased. 

Sugar. If the proportion of sugar to 1 egg and a cup of milk is increased, 
the coagulation temperature is elevated and coagulation begins above 80° C. 
The elevation of coagulation temperature is proportional to the amount 
of sugar added. If the custard is saturated w^ith sugar, coagulation does not 
occur at boiling temperature. 

Yolks. If two yolks are substituted for 1 whole egg the coagulation 
temperature is higher than for the whole egg. 

Whites. If two whites are substituted for the one whole egg the coagu- 
lation temperature is lower than for a custard made of the whole egg. With 
both the yolks and whites the coagulation temperature varies with the pro- 
portion of sugar used. 

The optimum temperature for cooking custards. Williams has 
reported that the curdling point for a custard made of 1 egg, 1 cup of milk, 
and 1 tablespoon of sugar is 83.5 °C. When the proportion of ingredients 
is varied the curdling point varies. If the proportion of egg is increased 
the curdling point is lowered ; increasing the sugar elevates the curdling 
point. 

The temperatures given previously and those reported by Williams are 
for soft custards. Baked custards may be cooked several degrees higher than 
soft custards without curdling. This lower curdling temperature for soft 
custards is probably due to the stirring, which increases the tendency for 
separation of the custards into curds. Hence, it is important in making 
soft custards to prevent heating after a certain temperature has been 
reached. This can be accomplished by putting the cooking pan in cold 
water or by pouring the custard into another utensil. 

Between the temperature at which coagulation starts and the curdling 
point is a temperature at which the custard has the best texture and flavor 
for serving. 

Williams has reported that the optimum temperature for custards made 
of 1 egg, 1 cup of milk, and 1 tablespoon of sugar is 82.5°C, When 2 
yolks are substituted for the whole egg the optimum temperature is 83.5°, 
and when 2 whites are substituted for the whole egg the optimum tem- 
perature is 82°. 

Custard pie. In cooking custard pie one of the major difficulties is 
to prevent soaking of the crust. Increasing the proportion of egg helps, 
as the custard then coagulates at a lower temperature. Thus 1^ eggs to a 
cup of milk is better than 1 egg. Prewarming the milk before adding it to 
the other ingredients shortens the time before coagulation takes place. 

One way to prevent soaking of the crust is to cook the pastry and the 



346 EGG COOKERY 

filling separately. Bake the pastry on the bottom side of a pie pan with 
sloping sides. Bake the custard in a pie pan of the same size as the one used 
for the crust, setting the pan in hot water and using as low an oven 
temperature as desired. After baking the custard, cool it until the pan feels 
warm but not hot to the hand. At this temperature it has set sufficiently 
to hold together, yet will not break so easily as when cold. Run a knife 
or spatula around the edge of the custard and, tilting it at about a 45-degree 
angle, shake and slide it out of the pan into the crust. 

Whipping Eggs and Egg Whites 

When an egg is whipped with an egg beater, or similar utensil, its vol- 
ume increases, owing to incorporation of air. The egg white because of its 
low surface tension and the stability of its surface films readily forms a 
foam. 

The essentials for a stable foam have been discussed in Chapter I. They 
are a low surface tension, a low vapor pressure, and a tendency for the 
substance in the surface to solidify, hence giving rigidity and permanence. 

Stages o£ stiffness in beating egg whites. With slight whipping 
the incorporated air bubbles are large, the egg white appears foamy yet 
transparent, is very runny, and will flow readily. With longer beating the 
air cells in the egg white become smaller, the appearance of the egg white 
is less transparent and more white. It still flows if the bowl is partially 
inverted. The egg white becomes stiffer with continued beating. The stiff- 
ness is due, in part at least, to the finer division of the air bubbles, and 
thus the amount of egg white utilized in forming films is greater. Many 
small air bubbles with their fine cell walls may be stronger and more 
rigid than a few large cells. As beating is continued the egg becomes very 
white, begins to lose a little of the moist, shiny appearance, and is stiff and 
rigid. If the bowl is inverted, the egg w^hite does not flow but remains in 
the bowl and the end of peaks stand up straight. If the egg is left to stand, 
the watery fluid collects at the bottom of the bowl more slowly. With 
longer beating the egg white appears dry, loses its shiny appearance, and 
small white patches that look like small curds may appear. This is the 
stage called dry in cook books. At this point the w^hite is very rigid and 
rather brittle so that with a whisk beater it is easily thrown out of the 
bowl in w^hich it is whipped. 

Methods of testing stiffness. There are several ways in which the stiff- 
ness may be tested. For household use the tests are ( 1 ) appearance, (2) the 
height of peaks and the extent to which the point bends over when the egg 
beater or some utensil is lifted out of the beaten white, and (3) the rate 
of flow when the bowl or plate in which the white is beaten is partially 
inverted. A skillful operator working constantly with egg w^hite soon 
learns to judge the degree of stiffness by these common household methods, 
and the degree of proficiency that can be attained is surprising. But for 



SALT AND WHIPPING OF EGG WHITES 347 

experimental purposes the same degree of stiffness probably could not be 
duplicated in another laboratory from the description. In the home the 
height of the peaks, and particularly the extent the point falls over, is the 
best criterion for judging stiffness. The rate of flow is not quite so good 
unless the same quantity of egg white is always used, for a large quantity 
must be beaten stiffer to flow at the same rate as a smaller quantity. 

For laboratory purposes, (1) specific gravity, (2) foaming power, and 
(3) the amount of drainage during a definite time are used to test the 
stiffness and stability of the foam. Specific gravity is determined by divid- 
ing the weight of a given volume of egg white by the weight of the same 
volume of water at the same temperature. Barmore reports that foams with 
specific gravity of 0.15 to 0.16 yield good angel cakes. Bailey calculated 
foaming power by means of the formula : 



{^m)- 



100 



where F = foaming power of egg white, F = volume of dish in cubic 
centimeters, and IV = weight of foam in grams. The specific gravity of 
the original egg white was taken as 1.04. 

The stability of a foam may be tested by putting a given weight of foam 
in a funnel of known capacity and bore. The funnel is covered to prevent 
evaporation. If the funnel is placed in a graduated cylinder, the drainage 
may be read in cubic centimeters or the weight taken at the end of a 
definite time, usually 30, 40, or 60 minutes. When the egg white is not 
beaten sufficiently both the unbeaten egg white and the foam drain from 
the funnel. After a certain stage of beating is reached little drainage 
occurs. With still longer beating Barmore states the drainage increases. 
Work of students in the author's laboratory, Keltner, Hoskey, and Loaft, 
though not extensive enough to be conclusive, indicates that better angel 
cakes are obtained if a certain percentage of drainage occurs, the exact 
amount varying with different types of egg beaters. 

Salt and the whipping o£ egg whites. It is traditional that a small 
amount of salt added to egg white is an aid in increasing foaming and 
stiffness. This could easily be tested but so far as the writer knows its effect 
on stability has not been reported. It has been found that electrolytes are 
necessary for heat coagulation of proteins. They may also aid coagulation 
by mechanical means or surface denaturation. The more likely explanation 
is the one previously given for protein solutions and electrolytes. The pro- 
tein lowers the surface tension but the addition of salt lowers it still more, 
thus causing a greater concentration of the protein at the air/liquid inter- 
face, hence a slight stiffening. The addition of salt may result in a slight 
salting-out effect and a stiffening of the membrane around the air bubbles. 
This would have the same result as in emulsions. For, by the last mecha- 
nism a certain amount of salt would bring about maximum stabilization 



348 EGG COOKERY 

of the emulsion or foam, but too large a quantity would have the tendency 
to break the emulsion or the foam. 

Acids and stability of egg white foams. Barmore in his last 
publication states that when acid substances were added in sufficient quan- 
tity to adjust the egg white to pH 8 the stability of the foam was prac- 
tically the same for acetic and citric acids and for cream of tartar. But at 
pH 6 the cream of tartar produced the most stable foam. The acid sub- 
stances increased the stability of the foams. 

The addition of the acid delays the formation of the foam, i.e., if beaten 
for a definite time the foams containing acid are not as stiff as those con- 
taining no acid. This is particularly true for both acetic and citric acids. 

The addition of sugar to egg white foams. Adding sugar to the 
egg white increases the stability of the foam, for less drainage occurs when 
the egg is beaten to a definite stiffness. However, a longer time is required 
to beat the egg white, if the sugar is added before the beating is completed, 
but this also makes it difficult to overheat the foam. Because sugar retards 
denaturation of the egg white foam, it is a good practice to add sugar to 
the egg white as soon as beating is started when whites for angel cakes 
are whipped at high speed on a machine. It would also appear that less 
leakage might occur in meringues for pies if the sugar is added by beating 
it into the white as the white is beaten. 

Egg white is partially coagulated during beating. In whipping 
the egg white is finely divided, so that from the physical subdivision it 
is far more rigid and stiff. But the beating has brought about other changes 
in the egg w^hite. In speaking of the methods by which coagulation may 
be brought about, Ostwald states, ''When egg white is beaten to a foam, 
a part is regularly coagulated in the walls enclosing the air bubbles. A 
decrease in degree of dispersion to the point of inducing coagulation can 
also be brought about through centrifuging, etc. These belong to the 
mechanical methods of producing coagulation." 

Effect of temperature upon whipping of eggs. Since a low sur- 
face tension is one essential for the formation of a foam, it follows that a 
lowering of the surface tension will aid its formation. Eggs that are taken 
from the refrigerator and beaten while still cold do not whip up as readily 
or quickly as those at room temperature. Surface tension is lowered with 
increased temperature so that it is probably one factor in bringing about 
this result. 

The Bakery Research Department of Procter & Gamble Company have 
reported that "regardless of the length of time of beating, a given sugar 
and egg mixture, when whipped at 60°F., will never become as light as 
will a mixture of the same proportions beaten at the same speed and at a 
temperature of 110°F." 

St. John and Flor found that a greater volume was obtained at room 
temperature, about 21 °C., than at refrigerator temperature, 13°C. A still 
better volume was obtained at 30°C., but they report that while drying 



EGG BEATERS 349 

the whites to measure the volume the liquid part from those beaten at the 
highest temperature separated more readily. 

Season and age of eggs and whipping. The whipping quality of 
eggs varies, according to the season in which they are produced. Nemetz 
has reported experiments in w^hich whole eggs that had been broken and 
frozen in April, July, and September were used. The eggs were used in 
sponge cake and cream puffs. With all mixing and baking conditions stand- 
ardized, the April eggs gave a 15 per cent increase and the September 
ones a 10 per cent increase in volume over the July eggs in sponge cake. 
Similar results were obtained in cream puffs. 

Burke and Niles found that egg whites from eggs produced during the 
season when eggs are considered less desirable beat to a stiffer foam when 
beaten the same length of time than the whites from eggs produced early 
in the spring. 

Nemetz states that if fresh or frozen eggs are used in a similar mix 
under identical conditions, greater volume and greater yield will be obtained 
from frozen eggs. 

Bakers also claim that egg whites do not whip as well if used the next 
week after being frozen as when they have been frozen at least three 
months. 

Barmore states that the older the eggs, when whites were beaten for 
equal lengths of time, i.e., 1, 2, and 3 minutes, the less stable the foam. 
However, when eggs were beaten 4 minutes the stability was practically 
the same for all ages of egg used, e.g., fresh, 3, 6, and 9 days. 

Egg beaters. Egg whisks or whips are made with wires of varying 
thickness. The thick wire does not whip or divide the egg white as easily 
as the finer wire. The air cells are larger than when a whisk with finer 
wires is used, though the size of the enclosed air bubbles decreases with 
longer beating with any type of beater. Whisks with thicker wires may 
require two to four times as many strokes to beat an egg white to a definite 
stiffness as one with finer wires. Some egg whisks beat the egg quickly, 
dividing it into many very fine cells without giving an excess of the curdy- 
looking precipitate within the whipped white. Some produce a greater 
curdled appearance than others, even when the egg does not appear to be 
beaten to the same stage of stiffness. With the type of whisk that produces 
the very curdled appearance of the egg white, the cell walls of the omelet 
or souffle are more likely to collapse during baking, and, by many cell walls 
running together, a very coarse texture is obtained or the product falls. 
The above statements regarding whisks also apply to egg beaters of the 
rotary type. There is some variation in the width and the curvature of 
the blades of these beaters. 

If the quotation concerning emulsifying apparatus, from Clayton, in the 
chapter on emulsions is changed to read, "It is quite reasonable to believe 
that for any given egg beater there exists an optimum speed or degree of 
agitation or beating, and an optimum time of beating, whereby the most 



350 EGG COOKERY 

perfect beaten egg white is obtained for a definite use," the statement may 
apply equally to egg beaters. 

Longer experience only emphasizes the importance of the foregoing quo- 
tation from the chapter on emulsions. For instance, in the Foods Laboratory 
a procedure had been worked out whereby excellent angel cake is made by 
beating the egg white and adding the sugar, using high speed on the 
Kitchen Aid. The beating must be timed to the second, because with 
several hundred r. p. m. a few seconds too long makes a tremendous 
difference. 

When Peet and Lowe began work on starting baked products in cold 
and preheated ovens, it was necessary to mix six times the angel cake 
recipe at one time. But it was found that the time of beating the egg whites 
on an institutional, large-sized Hobart mixer had to be increased over the 
time used with the Kitchen Aid to have the same stage of stiffness. 

Bailey obtained larger volume from the thick portion of the white than 
from the thin part when whipped on a Hobart type mixer, but results 
were opposite on an electric Dover type. 

Barmore states that with hand rotary beaters there w^as more reduction 
in viscosity for the corresponding reduction in specific gravity than with 
the electric beater used in his experiments. It has been the experience in 
this laboratory that Barmore's hand beaters 1 and 2 are poor types. 

Hand-operated rotary beaters may be turned at varying speeds. But fast 
initial beating of egg white gives a larger volume to the egg white. 

The gear ratio for hand-operated rotary beaters is about 1 to 5, i.e., one 
turn of the handle gives about 5 revolutions of the blades. If the handle 
is turned 120 r. p. m., the blades would turn about 600 revolutions. The 
speed of electric mixers, depending on the particular mixer, the speed, and 
for some mixers the load or stiffness of material used, may range from 300 
to 2400 r. p. m. 

Wire whisks or rotary beaters. One question that is constantly asked 
regarding the whipping of egg whites is whether it is better to beat them 
with a whisk or rotary beater. A great deal depends upon whether the 
egg whisk or rotary beater is a good type of its class or a poor one. If the 
eggs are whipped so that the cells in the cake are the same size there 
seems to be little difference in the finished product. Whisks sometimes 
give a larger volume than rotary beaters in angel cake. 

Combination of egg albumin with metals. Sometimes in beating egg 
white a pink color develops. This is due to a combination of the egg albu- 
min with a metal like copper or iron. The color develops more frequently 
when the acid cream of tartar is added, as in beating egg whites for angel 
cakes, but it may develop without its addition. Some egg beaters have 
blades of copper that are plated. After the plating is worn off the copper 
is exposed. The pink color has often been noticed when folding sugar into 
the beaten egg whites with a spatula. Probably some other factor than the 
presence of the metal alone is necessary to bring about the color change, 



SOFT MERINGUES 351 

for the color does not always develop when the egg whites are beaten with 
such beaters or when spatulas are used. 

Meringues 

Meringues vary in the quantity of sugar added and in their use. Only 
soft and hard ones will be considered here. 

Soft meringues. One general use for soft meringues is for pies. The 
factors determining to the greatest extent whether a desirable meringue is 
obtained are : the extent of beating the egg white, the adding of the sugar, 
the baking temperature and time, and an optimum proportion of sugar to 
egg white. Good meringues have been obtained by many methods, but the 
following method is successful for a majority of the experimenters. Beat 
the sugar into the egg white — preferably during the latter half of beating, 
but it may be added at the start — w^ith a rotary egg beater, until the whites 
are stiff and shiny. The peaks are fairly stiff and the tip end only slightly 
rounded. 

The sugar stabilizes the egg-white foam. Greater stabilization seems 
to be attained when the opportunity for solution is greater, i.e., in beating 
instead of folding. Since adding the sugar during beating increases the 
time required for obtaining a definite stiffness, there is less danger of over- 
beating. In some class problems less leakage of the meringue has occurred 
when the sugar was added in the above manner. 

Since leaky meringues give undesirable moistness and slipperiness to the 
top of the pastry filling and make cutting difficult, how to prevent this 
leakage is a question frequently asked. The Institute of American Poultry 
Industries states that there seems to be no advantage in adding a small 
amount of water to the meringue. Although water increases the volume, 
there seems to be a tendency for the meringue to leak a short time after 
baking. 

Insufficient beating of the egg white, especially if the sugar is folded 
instead of beaten into the meringue, after the sugar is added is sometimes 
a factor in causing leakage. Over-beating of the egg white before sugar 
is added may also increase the tendency to leakage. 

Too small an amount of sugar to each egg white tends to give a less 
fluffy, less tender meringue and one lacking in sweetness. Too much sugar 
tends to give a gummy crust or one containing sugar crystals, though the 
amount of sugar that can be used to obtain a desirable meringue depends 
on the fineness of the sugar and perhaps on its rate of solution. In general, 
2 tablespoons of fine or berry sugar per egg white give the best results. 
With ultra-fine crystals, as many as 3 tablespoons of sugar per egg white 
can be used; whereas with coarser granulated sugar, hitherto used more 
than at present, less than 2 tablespoons per egg is desirable. Powdered 
sugar containing starch is usually not satisfactory in meringues. Honey, 
sirup, or jelly may be used in meringues, but only 1 tablespoon per egg 



352 EGG COOKERY 

white. Red jellies often give a blue rather than a pink tinge to the 
meringue. 

Baking necessarily requires a longer time at a lower temperature. All of 
the following temperatures have been used successfully, though a majority 
of the students working on meringues as special problems preferred 425° 
and 400°F.: 425°F. for 6 minutes, 400°F. for 8 minutes, 350°F. for 12 
to 18 minutes, and 325°F. for 18 to 25 minutes. With temperatures 
below 325 °F., the time is long, the meringue often shrinks after being 
removed from the oven, and dries too much. 

Hard meringues. Hard meringues contain a larger proportion of 
sugar than soft meringues. Because of the high sugar content they have 
a fairly smooth, somewhat crystalline, crisp crust. They are usually puffy 
in appearance and are used for accompaniment to, as a foundation for, or 
as a dessert. 

The optimum amount of sugar appears to be 4 to 5 tablespoons per egg 
white, the smaller quantity probably being preferable. Since acid increases 
the tenderness of egg white, its addition is desirable. About 1 to 2 cc. of 
vinegar per egg white may be used ; but, since cream of tartar produces 
a more stable foam than acetic acid, the use of cream of tartar may be 
preferable. About 1^ per cent of cream of tartar, or between ^ to 34 
teaspoon of cream of tartar per egg white, is satisfactory. 

The sugar is added in the same manner as for soft meringues, but, 
because of the larger quantity added, better results are usually obtained 
if it is added gradually. 

Bake on heavy paper at as low a temperature as possible, 225° to 275°F., 
for 40 to 60 minutes, the time depending on the temperature and size of 
the meringues. If the meringue is eaten shortly after baking, the soft 
centers, if not entirely dried in baking, are not objectionable. However, 
they may be removed. If the meringues are to stand over night, the Insti- 
tute of American Poultry Industries recommends letting them stand in 
the oven until cool, after the heat is turned off, in order to dry the centers. 

Omelets 

There are several types of omelets. They are designated in various ways 
as plain, French, and foamy omelets. Some have a white sauce or tapioca 
basis. In others, bread crumbs are used to absorb a part of the moisture. 
The type of omelet that has the egg yolk folded into the beaten white is 
sometimes called a foamy omelet. This is the type that requires the most 
skill in making and is the one mentioned here. 

Method of mixing foamy omelet. The yolk is beaten until foamy 
and then folded into the stiffly beaten egg white. The cooked omelet should 
be light, tender, and foamy, and it should not collapse or fall after cook- 
ing, though some shrinkage usually occurs. Whether the product obtained 
fulfils these conditions depends to a great extent upon the amount of beat- 



ADDITION OF LIQUID TO FOAMY OMELET 353 

ing of the egg white, the mixing of the egg white and the yolk, and a 
proper cooking temperature. The egg whites for omelets need to be 
whipped nearly or quite stiff enough to stay in an inverted bowl. Unless 
they are sufficiently stiff there is a tendency for the liquid to drain to 
the bottom of the bowl or cooking pan. After the yolks are mixed with the 
whites this tendency is increased. Sometimes the liquid portion does collect 
in the bottom of the cooking pan and coagulates there while cooking, form- 
ing a thick compact layer. This is due to insufficient beating of the whites, 
or insufficient mixing of the yolk with the white, so that the yolk is not 
sufficiently blended through the white to be held up by the framework 
or physical structure of the whipped white, or it may be due to standing too 
long after mixing before cooking is started. The pan into which the omelet 
is poured should be hot enough to start coagulation of the egg, but not 
hot enough to form a hard crust. However, over-mixing and rough han- 
dling cause loss of too large a portion of the air incorporated into the 
egg white. Over-beating of the egg white before the yolk is added results 
in loss of extensibility, and the volume of the omelet does not increase as 
much as it should during baking. It is also drier and sometimes powdery. 
But with omelets it seems better to err a little on the side of over-beating 
rather than under-beating. 

Formation of ferrous sulfide in omelets. The green color develops 
on the bottom of the omelet only when some of the egg has separated and 
drained to the bottom. It is due to the formation of hydrogen sulfide from 
the white and its combination with iron of the yolk. It may be prevented 
by sufficient beating of the egg white, by thoroughly blending the yolk 
and white, or by starting cooking promptly. The color may develop in 
omelets cooked on top of the stove, or in those cooked in Pyrex, but occurs 
more often in baked ones, for the baking requires a longer time. 

Effect of addition of a liquid to a foamy omelet. A tablespoon 
of water for each egg is usually added to the white or to the yolk. If to 
the white of the egg, it may be added before the white is beaten or after 
it is beaten enough to become frothy but not stiff. The volume of the 
beaten white with the addition of the liquid is usually greater than an 
egg white without the added liquid. Sometimes other factors due to size 
of the egg, its deterioration in quality, or other causes affect its beating 
qualities and a poor volume is attained. It has already been stated that 
increasing alkalinity tends to prevent coagulation. Thus very old eggs may 
not beat as well as fresher ones. The hydration of the white increases the 
tenderness of the omelet as well as its elasticity. The white being more 
elastic, a larger volume is obtained during cooking. If too much water is 
added to the egg a point is reached at which the white becomes too tender 
and too many cells break when the air expands during cooking. Evidently 
the addition of water to egg white retards coagulation by beating, for a 
longer time is required to beat the white to a definite stage than when no 



354 EGG COOKERY 

liquid is added. This retardation of coagulation may be due to the lessened 
concentration of the egg white. 

Kind o£ liquid in omelets. The liquid added to foamy omelets may 
be water, vegetable juice, tomato juice, or a mixture of one-third lemon 
juice and two-thirds water. If a tablespoon of milk is added to an egg white 
it will not form a foam. If added to the beaten white the volume is quickly 
reduced and the foam is destroyed. Dizmang and Sunderlin investigated 
the effect of milk on the whipping quality of egg white. Their results are 
given in Table 42, and indicate that the fat of the milk is responsible lor 
breaking the foam. But the size of the fat globules is also important, 
smaller particles having less effect.

The addition of 1 teaspoon of lemon juice and 2 teaspoons of water to 
an egg white brings the reaction to about />H 4.8, the isoelectric point 
of the egg albumin. It may be higher or lower, depending on the original 
^H and perhaps the size of the egg. The addition of a tablespoon of tomato 
juice to an egg white does not lower the pH to 4.8. The addition of tomato 
juice and the lemon juice results in a more tender omelet, and one of 
greater volume, if the conditions of mixing have been standardized, if the 
liquid is added after the egg white is partially beaten, and if beaten to the 
same degree of stiffness. Tomato juice requires longer for whipping than 
the water, and the mixture of lemon juice and water requires still longer 
than the tomato juice. The addition of the acid tomato and of the lemon 
lessens the alkalinity of the egg white. Bogue has reported that the foam- 
ing properties of gelatin are greatest at the isoelectric point. If the foaming 
properties of egg white are also greater at the isoelectric point, a greater 



REVIEW OF LITERATURE ON ANGEL CAKE 355 

volume might be expected at pH 4.8. This greater volume is usually 
obtained, with the addition of tomato or lemon juice, but a longer whipping 
time is required. Tomato and lemon both contain citric acid. The greater 
tenderness with the use of tomato juice and lemon juice probably results 
from a peptizing effect of the citrate ion on the egg protein. If lemon juice 
is merely added to egg white without whipping it, coagulation of the egg 
white is produced, but with beating the lemon juice is thoroughly mixed 
with the egg white. A better volume is usually obtained if the egg white 
is beaten until frothy before the lemon juice or tomato juice is added. 

Temperature for cooking omelets. Omelets are usually cooked above 
heat, but baking them in the oven is an easy method to secure uniform 
temperatures for class work. A temperature of 160° to 165°C. is a good 
one to use. If the temperature is too low the omelet tends to separate while 
cooking, the liquid portion collecting in the bottom of the cooking utensil 
and forming a solid mass with the foamy part on top. Too high a tempera- 
ture for cooking leaves the inside of the omelet too moist unless the outer 
portion is over-cooked and thus toughened. In cooking over the heat the 
omelet needs to be covered. The omelet can be placed under the broiler to 
brown the top quickly. 

Angel Cake 

Angel and sponge cakes are included under egg cookery because they 
logically belong here and not under batters and doughs. The texture of the 
finished cake depends chiefly upon the manipulation of the egg, and the 
cooking temperature corresponds to that used for egg cookery. 

Review o£ literature on angel cake. Excellent work has been 
reported from different laboratories on angel and sponge cake and a review 
of this literature seems rather imperative. 

Hunt and St. John separated the thick and the thin portion of egg 
whites. The average volume of the cakes from the thin portions was greater 
than for the cakes made from the thick portions. They have also reported 
that the volumes of angel food cakes made from egg whites beaten at 
room temperature, 21 °C., were larger than cakes made from similar whites 
beaten at 5°C. The grain of the cakes made from whites beaten at room 
temperature was finer and the cakes more tender than those from whites 
beaten at 5°C. 

Hedstrom, in studying the effect of the consistency of the egg white on 
the volume and texture of angel cakes, found the percentage of thin white 
increased, as did the />H, with increased age of the eggs. The effect of age 
of the eggs on the volume of the cakes is shown in Fig. 35. It is obvious 
that there are some discrepancies in these results. Nevertheless, they are 
given here, for further work, which is not complete, appears to substantiate 
these results in that cake volume decreases with increased age of the eggs.

EGG COOKERY 



Barmore's results of investigating the influence of chemical and physical 
factors on egg-w^hite foams are as foUow^s: stability of the foams was 
determined by beating the egg white with an electric food mixer and 
photographing the foams 2 and 10 minutes after beating had stopped. The 
specific gravity of foams was determined. Stability of the foams was further 
determined by placing the egg-white foam in a funnel and determining the 
drainage at definite intervals.

Age of Eggs in Days 
Fig. 35. — Relation of angel cake volume to the age of the eggs. (Hedstrom.) 

It was found that the older the eggs, the lighter the specific gravity of 
the foam after beating for a definite period of time. The addition of 
potassium acid tartrate, citric, and acetic acid increased the stability of the 
foams. The longer the foam is beaten, the less stable it becomes so that its 
stability is inversely proportional to its specific gravity. 

Stanley states that the thin w^hite beats up to a larger volume than the 
thick white. But the volume of the cake made from the thick white is 
larger than that made from the thin white and cakes made from the 
thick white have greater elasticity. 

Barmore reported from his investigations o'n baking angel cake at various 
altitudes that increasing the egg or flour, or both, in an angel cake in- 
creases its tensile strength. Conversely, increasing the sugar decreases the 
tensile strength or increases the tenderness. Barmore says that his formula, 

F-.43*S-. 41^ + 24.5 = 0, 

gives all the possible, successful recipes for this type of flour mixture for 



REVIEW OF LITERATURE ON ANGEL CAKE 357 

any habitable altitude. F represents flour in grams ; S, sugar in grams ; and 
A, altitude in thousands of feet. The egg white was kept constant at 210 
grams and the flour should be not less than 40 nor exceed 80 grams for 
this proportion of egg white. For 1 gram of egg white this allows 0.19 and 
0.39 gram of flour respectively. 

King, Morris, and Whiteman investigated "some methods and apparatus 
used in measuring the quality of eggs for cake making." The physical and 
chemical measurements made on the eggs were carbon dioxide content of 
the white and the yolk, /)H and total solids on white, yolk, and magma, 
and viscosity of the magma. They say more work should be done on the 
relation between CO2 content and /)H before it can be said that the 
increase in /)H of the white is due entirely to a loss of CO2. The lifting 
power of the eggs was based on measurements of specific gravity and /)H 
of the cake batter and on volume, tensile strength, and compressibility of 
the sponge cakes. They report that the chemical and physical properties 
of the eggs so far measured have shown no definite relation to the various 
cake measurements. 

Barmore determined ''the influence of various factors, including altitude, 
in the production of angel food cake." He concludes that the whites of 
fresh eggs should be beaten with 1 to 2 per cent of cream of tartar to a 
specific gravity of not less than 0.15 and not more than 0.17. Part or all 
of the sugar should be added before the addition of any of the flour, for 
the addition of the sugar strengthened the egg-white foam; whereas the 
volume of the batter decreased considerably more when the flour was 
added with the sugar than when it was added by itself, after the sugar 
had been beaten into the egg foam. A summary of Barmore's extensive 
investigations follows : 

At /)H 8 the stability of the egg-white foam was practically the same 
for acetic and citric acids and cream of tartar. But at /)H 6 the cream of 
tartar produced the most stable foam. 

Cakes baked at 178°C. for 30 minutes had larger volume, were more 
moist and more tender, probably because of larger volume, than cakes 
baked at 163°, 152°, or at 138°C. The last required 100 minutes for 
baking. Baking at the highest oven temperature produced an interior tem- 
perature about 2°C. higher than in cakes baked at the lowest temperature, 
though the difference in oven temperature was 40 °C. 

Eggs several days old made poorer cakes than fresh eggs. The reason 
suggested for this is hydrolysis of the egg proteins rather than increased 
proportion of thin whites. 

No moisture was lost by evaporation by any portion of the cake farther 
from the outer edge than 1 cm. *'Cake baked at the low temperature 
appeared to contain less moisture, because the center of the cake felt and 
tasted much drier than that baked at a higher temperature for a shorter 



358 EGG COOKERY 

time. The data show that one was just as moist in the center as the other. 
The difference in feel was apparently occasioned by the difference in the 
condition or location of the moisture. Perhaps in the low-temperature cake 
the moisture had been more completely removed from the sugar solution 
and absorbed by the starch or protein, because of the greater length of 
time the cake was maintained at a high temperature." 

In studying the influence of acid and sugar on the initial coagulation 
temperature of egg white (different proportions of sugar and acid added to 
egg white, placed in test tubes for heating) it was found that sugar in- 
creased but acid lowered the initial coagulation temperature of the egg 
white. Adding both sugar and acid in proportions used in cakes raised the 
temperature at which coagulation of the egg w^hite started. However, in 
spite of the lowered initial coagulation of the egg white by the addition of 
acid, its addition increased the tenderness of the egg white. In the test with 
egg white coagulated at various temperatures it was found that the lower 
the temperature at which coagulation occurred the more tender the egg 
white. 

''With increases in altitude it has been shown that the amount of expan- 
sion during baking increases; the cake becomes more tender; the final cake 
volume changes and is related to tenderness; the amount and rate of 
evaporation increases; the maximum internal cake temperature decreases; 
the volume of the vapor escaping increases; and the color of the crust 
becomes lighter." 

Peet and Lowe baked angel food cakes in six ranges, three electric, two 
gas, and one kerosene. Cakes were baked in ranges cold at the start and in 
preheated ovens. 

The results of analysis of scores showed that the judges did not dif- 
ferentiate among cakes baked in the different ranges for total score, texture, 
and eating quality. However, for these same points the judges thought 
the cakes baked in the preheated ovens were superior to those baked in the 
same ranges from a cold start. Furthermore, these differences, as shown by 
analysis of variance, were highly significant. 

The scores for moistness w^ere higher for cakes baked in preheated ovens 
but these results were not analyzed statistically. 

Tenderness was tested in two ways, one subjective and one objective 
test. The analysis of scores for tenderness indicated that the cakes baked 
in some ranges were more tender than cakes baked in other ranges. The 
statistical analysis showed that these results were significant. The judges, 
as indicated by scores, considered there were still greater differences in 
tenderness of cakes baked from a cold and from preheated starts, than for 
cakes baked in different ranges. These results were highly significant, the 
cakes started in preheated ovens being tenderer than those baked from a 
cold start. The analysis of data obtained by tensile strength measurements 
also indicated significant differences in tenderness of cakes baked in dif- 



REVIEW OF LITERATURE ON ANGEL CAKE 359 

ferent ranges and highly significant differences between cakes started in 
cold and preheated ovens, those started in preheated ovens being more 
tender. The correlation coefficient between the two methods of testing ten- 
derness was —.4014, which was significant. This indicates that in general 
there was agreement in the two methods of testing tenderness. 

The volumes of cakes varied in the different ranges, the results being 
significant, i.e., cakes of larger volume were obtained in some ranges than 
in others. The volumes of cakes baked in preheated ovens were greatest, 
and the differences were significant. 

Burke and Niles made angel food cake on the same day of the week 
throughout the year, from eggs of the same age, produced by the same 
flock on controlled feed for the duration of the experiment. The quality 
of the cakes, at first fairly good, decreased to a low in November. After 
a slight rise in December there was again a decline in January. A notice- 
able increase in quality occurred in February and March. They state that 
the egg-white foams during the "low" and ''high" periods seemed to differ 
in the time required to beat to the stiff stage. During the "low" period the 
whites seemed much stiffer and less tender than those in the "high" when 
beaten for the same length of time. They state that perhaps, if the amount 
of beating were standardized according to some factor other than time for 
beating, excellent cakes could be made during the "low" months as well as 
the "high." 

One cake each week was baked at 350°F. for 45 minutes, and three 
cakes at 325 °F. for 1 hour. Consistently throughout the year the moisture 
loss was less and the volume usually noticeably larger for the cakes baked 
at the higher temperature. The average moisture loss for the year was 11.2 
and 9.6 per cent, and the average volume 7.79 and 7.85 cm., respectively, 
for cakes baked at 325° and 350°F. 

King, Whiteman, and Rose investigated the effect on the cake-making 
quality of some egg-production factors. The physical and chemical measure- 
ments of eggs, cake batter, and sponge cake were the same as those reported 
for King, Morris, and Whiteman, with the exception that elasticity or 
recovery of the cake crumb is added in the present study. They found that 
five different diets of the hens did not affect the properties of the eggs or 
the quality of the cake made from them. Most of the eggs used were 
obtained over a period of seven months (December- June), beginning about 
three months after the hens started laying, and were collected and dipped 
in mineral oil saturated with carbon dioxide. They found no progressive 
change in the properties of the eggs or the quality of the cakes over the 
period in the laying cycle of the hen or the seasons of the year studied. As 
in the earlier study they found no apparent relationship between the physi- 
cal and chemical properties of the eggs studied and the quality values of 
the cakes.

"There was a relationship between the specific volume, elasticity, and 
compressibility of the sponge cakes, and between the pH and specific 
gravity of the batter from which the cakes were baked. 

"Findings of an earlier study which indicated that there is no relation- 
ship between pH and COo content of egg white were confirmed."

Only the first five formulas have been made in class work at 900-feet 
elevation. Excellent cakes may be made from these five formulas, though II 
is less likely to be successful. The last three formulas are from Barmore's 
tables; VII and VIII are for 1000-feet elevation with the largest and 
smallest amounts of flour advocated, respectively. Further analysis of these 
formulas is found in Table 44. 

Since sugar tends to prevent coagulation of the egg white, there is an 
amount of sugar which, if exceeded, will prevent coagulation to such an 
extent that the cake is so tender it will fall. It is desirable to use an amount 
that will just prevent the cake from falling. However, this particular 
amount of sugar will depend somewhat upon the amount of flour. The 
flour increases the toughness of the cake. Hence there is a ratio of sugar 
to flour, so that, within certain limits, as the sugar is decreased the flour 
must also be decreased. For the formulas given the ratio of sugar to flour 
is 3 to 1 in four of the recipes and 2.5 to 1 in the standard recipe. 

The illustrations are all for angel cakes which were baked from the 
same quantity of material, one-sixth of the recipe. The pans were small 
ones so that the photographs are nearly actual size. Thus the illustrations

show the comparative volume of the cakes, and the cells are nearly actual

Beating the egg whites for angel cake. The beating of the egg 
whites is one of the important steps in making angel cake. For the best 
results, the whites should not be beaten quite as stiff as for foamy omelets 
and souffles. The probable reasons for this are the stabilizing influence of 
sugar on the egg-white foam and the absorption of moisture by the flour. 

If the egg whites are not beaten a cake of small volume and very soggy 
texture is obtained. When the egg white is beaten the volume of the cake 
increases with the degree of stiffness of the whites, until a stage is reached 
at which the greatest volume is attained. Continued beating of the egg 
white after that to produce the maximum volume gradually reduces the 
volume of the cake, the reduction in volume being in proportion to the 
amount of over-beating of the egg white. The influence of the extent of 
beating the egg white on the volume of the cake is shown in Figs. 40 and 
41, Experiments 69, C and E. 

Result of insufficient beating of the egg white. The egg whites for the 
cakes in Fig. 40, Experiment 69C, were all beaten together. One-third 
of the total weight of the egg white was removed for cake 1 after the egg 
whites were beaten until they flowed when the bowl was partially inverted. 
The volume is less than when the whites were beaten to flow very slowly 
for cake 2. When the egg whites are whipped too little, not as much air 
is enclosed and the film of egg white surrounding the air bubbles is not 
as thin as it is with longer beating. If the egg white is beaten still less 
than for the illustration, the volume is still smaller. With very little beat- 
ing, the egg white is quite runny and the cake is tough and compact. 



362 EGG COOKERY 

Occasionally a gummy layer is found in the bottom of the baked cake. It is 
often difficult to give an explanation for this, but it may sometimes be due 
to insufficient whipping of the egg whites. 

Maximum beating of the egg white. The whites for the cakes in Fig. 
37, for cake 2, Fig. 40, and for cake 1, Fig. 41, were beaten until the 
tip end of peaks was slightly rounded and fallen. The cakes are more 
tender and have a larger volume than when the whites are not beaten 
sufficiently. The appearance and stiffness of the egg whites for a maximum 
volume in the cake vary slightly with the type and kind of egg beater used. 




Fig. 36. — The bowl on the right with the sloping sides is a good type for mixing 
and folding. 

The bowl on the left has sides that are too straight for efficient folding. 

The spatula on the right has a round handle that fits the hand. 

The spatula on the left has 4 edges that tend to blister the hand with long folding. 

With a maximum volume of the cake the cell walls are thinner, w^hich 
tends to produce a more tender cake. 

Effect of over-beating the egg white. For cake 3, Fig. 40, the egg whites 
were beaten until quite stiff. The volume is decidedly less than for cake 2. 
Longer beating results in a still smaller volume, see cake 3, Fig. 41. The 
smaller volume with over-beating is due to excess coagulation of the egg 
white by beating. This lessens the elasticity of the egg white; hence, w^hen 
the air bubbles enclosed in the beaten egg white expand from the heat 
during baking, some of the cell walls rupture instead of expanding. When 
a number of the cells rupture during baking, several cell walls coalesce, the 
cell walls are thicker, and the volume is reduced. 

Mixing angel cake. After the egg whites are beaten the other ingre- 
dients are folded into the cake. The water, cream of tartar, and the salt are 
added to the partially beaten egg whites. The flavoring may also be added 
to the egg white at the same time as the cream of tartar. This eliminates 
extra folding after the sugar and flour are added. For directions for fold- 
ing, see Experiment 68 ; and for types of bowls. Fig. 36. 



MIXING ANGEL CAKE 363 

Sugar. The sugar may be folded into the egg whites after they are 
beaten or whipped with the whites. The latter is sometimes called the 
meringue method. A certain amount of folding of the sugar with the egg 
white results in a cake of the best texture and tenderness. Too little folding 
does not blend the sugar sufficiently with the beaten whites ; then the flour 
does not fold in readily and heavy spots may be found throughout the 
cake. They may be quite small, but soggy and thick, and sometimes they 
contain just a trace of dry flour in the thickened spot. Such a spot is shown 
in Fig. 37, cake 1. The cakes usually increase in volume with longer folding 
of the sugar, reaching a maximum with about 60 strokes; then a slight 
decrease occurs with longer mixing. Sometimes the maximum volume occurs 
after folding about 40 strokes and sometimes after about 80 strokes. The 
tenderness of the cakes usually varies more with longer folding of the sugar 
than the volume. 

When the sugar is whipped into the whites, it may be added before 
whipping is started but this materially lengthens the time for whipping. The 
preferable time for adding the sugar is after the cream of tartar and salt 
are added. The sugar is added gradually for hand beaters and the whites 
beaten until stif¥ and shiny. The peaks stand up with slight rounding or 
bending of the tip ends. 

The meringue method is particularly good to use with an electric beater, 
for the rapid revolutions can soon over-whip the whites to the dry stage. 
Adding the sugar during whipping of the whites increases the time for 
beating but also tends to prevent mechanical coagulation and tends to pre- 
vent leakage, thus stabilizing the foam. 

In class work about nine times out of ten better results are obtained if all 
or at least half of the sugar is added to the egg white before any of the 
flour is added. Barmore reports the same result. Yet one person that the 
writer knows who makes excellent angel cakes always mixes all the sugar 
and flour together and then adds it to the egg white. It illustrates a point 
that constantly impresses all who have a chance to observe different people 
work with foods. There is no one method that always produces the best 
result. It seems best to give the method or methods successfully used by 
the majority. 

However, adding about three-fourths of the sugar to the egg whites and 
sifting the remainder with the flour make the flour easier to incorporate. 
Hence, the flour can be added with less folding with the result that tough- 
ness is not increased from long folding and the volume of the foam is not 
materially reduced. Mixing the sugar and the flour before adding to the 
egg white has not produced as satisfactory results as folding the sugar first. 
As one student remarked, *'The addition of the sugar to the egg white 
seems to prepare the egg for blending with the flour." 

Flour. The flour is folded into the mixed sugar and egg w^hite. Here 
the amount of mixing also affects the volume and tenderness of the cake. 
Too little mixing does not blend the flour sufficiently with the sugar and

egg white mixture, and the grain is coarser. Spots of flour may occasionally 
be found. These are more likely to occur when the sugar has not been 
sufficiently mixed, or when all the flour is sifted over the cake at one time, 
or if too thick a layer is used, which increases the difficulty of incorporating 
the flour, as it tends to pile and roll up in balls. Longer mixing of the flour 
with sugar and egg white tends to produce a fine grain and small cells. 
See Fig. 39, cakes 2 and 3. The longer mixing of flour also has a tendency 
to toughen the cake, which may be due to development of the gluten of 
the flour and to the thicker cell walls caused by combining several cells 
through loss of air by mixing. An amount of mixing of the flour just to 
blend it well with the egg white and sugar usually produces the best 
results. 

Texture. The texture and grain, also the volume and tenderness, of 
angel cake are influenced by several factors: (1) The mechanical treat- 
ment, which includes the kind of beater used, the degree of whipping of 
the whites, the method of and extent of mixing the ingredients; and (2) 
the ingredients used, their amount and kind. 

The factor determining the size of the cells to the greatest degree is the 
type of beater used and the extent to which the egg white is beaten, which 
has been considered. Longer whipping produces more and smaller air bubbles 
so that the cells are smaller, the grain finer. Rotary and electric beaters, 
in general, give finer grain than whisks. 

Beating the egg whites to obtain the possible maximum cake volume 
usually produces the most tender cake, for with a maximum volume the cell 
walls are stretched to the greatest extent, hence are thinnest. 

The method of folding or mixing also afFects the grain of the cake. 
After egg whites are whipped, the folding and mixing should be done 
gently and to retain as many of the air bubbles as possible. 

Longer mixing of the sugar with the egg whites tends to give a finer 
grain (see Fig. 37), but not to the extent that the folding of the flour 
does. Thus the grain or texture of the cake may vary to a certain extent, 
but a cake with thin cell walls and medium-sized cells that is so tender 
that it "melts in your mouth" is preferable to one that has a fine grain but 
is less tender. 

Ingredients used in angel cake. Flour. The amount of flour per 
gram of egg white may vary from 0.2 to 0.4 gram. The smaller amount 
tends to give a more moist and tender cake, the larger a more dry and less 
tender one. Cake flour produces a more tender cake than bread flour. It 
contains gluten that is not so tenacious, and therefore yields a cake that is 
more tender and of greater volume. The cakes made of bread flour shrink 
and pull away from the pan as they finish baking and while cooling. See 
Fig. 38, which is a reproduction of the manipulation and proportions for 
the cakes in Fig. 37. It is possible to obtain a fair cake from bread flour, 
but it is not as tender as with cake flour. Better results are obtained with 
bread flour if the sugar is increased by about 2 to 4 tablespoons or the

flour reduced by about 2 to 4 tablespoons. There is also a greater tendency 
for drops of sirup to collect on the surface of the crust when bread flour 
is used. 

Liquid. There does not seem to be any advantage in adding about 30 cc. 
of water to the egg white. 

Cream of tartar. Angel cake made without cream of tartar is cream 
colored. The cream of tartar produces a very white cake on account of 
the efifect of the acid salt on the flour. The flavone pigments of flour are 
cream colored when slightly alkaline but white when the reaction is acid 
or neutral. Also the addition of cream of tartar produces a more tender 
cake. Evidently the tartrate ion brings about peptization of the egg or flour 
proteins, or both. Increasing the quantity of cream of tartar beyond the 
amount used in the recipe produces a more tender cake and one that is 
more moist and tart in flavor. Barmore recommends that the amount of 
cream of tartar should be 1 to 2 per cent of the weight of the egg white. 
The amount given in the standard recipe is about 1.5 per cent. 

Sugar. A fine crystalline sugar, such as fruit or berry sugar, which dis- 
solves rapidly is excellent to use in angel cake. The maximum amount of 
sugar per gram of egg white is about 1 gram. At higher altitudes this must 
be decreased. At sea level, or up to 1000 feet above sea level, the sugar 
can be increased to 1.25 grams of sugar per gram of egg white provided 
the maximum amount of flour is used. But it must be handled carefully. 
See Fig. 41. Cakes with large proportions of sugar have a typical sugary 
crust. 

Temperature o£ baking angel cake. Reports of recent investiga- 
tions of baking temperatures for angel cake indicate that higher tempera- 
tures than those commonly used are preferable. Barmore reports that cakes 
baked at 178°C. (352°F.) had a larger volume, were more tender (prob- 
ably because of larger volume), and appeared more moist, though a moisture 
analysis showed no cakes lost moisture farther from the edge than 1 cm. 
Burke and Niles have reported a larger volume, more tender cakes, 
and less moisture loss for cakes baked at 350°F. than for those baked at 
325 °F. Peet and Lowe have reported a larger volume, more tender cakes, 
and more moist cakes when the cakes were baked in preheated ovens of 
electric, gas, and kerosene ranges than from a cold start in these same 
ranges. 

Whether still higher temperatures will be more desirable has not been 
reported. At present it appears that oven temperatures of 175° to 180°C. 
are preferable to 150° or 160°C. 

Sponge Cake 

Sponge cake, like angel cake and foamy omelets, depends chiefly upon 
the extent of whipping the egg whites, the mixing, and good proportions to 
produce a tender cake. 



REFERENCES 373 

Probably the most common fault in making sponge cake is insufficient 
beating of the egg yolks and sugar. These two ingredients, plus the liquid, 
if water or lemon juice is used, can be beaten until they are extremely 
light and foamy. This is most successfully done with rapid beating, prefer- 
ably by an electrically operated beater or a rotary beater rather than a 
whisk. Excellent sponge cakes may be made from only the yolks, provided 
some water is added and the yolks and sugar are beaten rapidly until very 
light. In the type of sponge cake recipe given in Experiment 70, when the 
flour is mixed too long with the sugar and egg yolks the cake is more com- 
pact and tough. But in some types of sponge cake in which considerable 
water is added, that is, the ones called water sponge, it is often necessary 
to beat the flour and egg yolks a long time to obtain a cake with thin cell 
walls and a uniform texture. In other words, this can be interpreted to 
mean that, for each recipe in which the proportion of ingredients varies 
from those in another recipe, the amount and the kind of manipulation to 
produce a cake of the best texture vary. 

Different methods of combining the ingredients may be used in mixing 
sponge cake. Several are suggested in Experiment 70. Excellent sponge 
cakes may be made by any method of mixing. The method of adding the 
water and lemon juice to the sugar, given in Experiment 70,3, produces 
rather uniform results when used by many different students. 

Piatt and Kratz have reported means of measuring and recording some 
characteristics of test sponge cakes, which can also be used with angel 
cake. These include measuring tensile strength, volume, and specific gravity. 

Whether the temperature for baking sponge cake like that for angel 
cake should be increased has not been reported. It has been shown in the 
author's laboratory that sponge cake made from egg yolks only is more 
desirable when baked at 350°F. than at 325°F. It is likely that most 
sponge cakes should be baked at the same temperatures as angel cake.

EGGS 

Cooking Eggs in Water 

Experiment 63. 

I. In the shell. 

A. To determine the effect of coagulation at different temperatures on the 
texture of the white and yolk. 

1. Cook an egg in water. Do not let the temperature of the water go 
above 72°C. It is easier to control the temperature, if a large quantity of 
water is used and the heat is turned low after the desired temperature is 
reached. Cook from 1 to 1^ hours. 

2. Cook an egg in water the temperature of which does not go above 85°C. 
Cook 30 to 35 minutes. 

3. Cook two eggs in boiling water. Cook 12 to 15 minutes. 

a. Cool one egg slowly, leaving it in the water in which it was cooked. 

b. Cool the other egg rapidly, letting cold water from faucet run over it 
until cold. 

Compare with the eggs from 1 and 2 in texture and firmness of the white 
and yolk. Which gives a tender and desirable product for eating? For slicing? 
Do any have a green layer at the junction of the white and yolk?

COOKING EGGS IN WATER 377 

B. To determine the effect of cooking for varying lengths of time at a 
high temperature upon the texture and consistency of egg white and yolk. 
Cook in boiling water. 

1. Cook 2 minutes. 

2. Cook 3 minutes. 

3. Cook 5 minutes. 

4. Cook 7 minutes. 

5. Cook 10 minutes. 

Compare the consistency of the white and yolk cooked for varying lengths 
of time. Compare with results obtained in A. 

II. Out of the shell. 

A. To determine the method of obtaining a desirable poached egg. 

Use a pan deep enough so that water will entirely cover the egg. Add a pint 
of water. Use more water if necessary, but all should use the same quantity. 
A film of fat rubbed over the bottom of the pan before the water is added 
seems to help prevent the egg from sticking to the pan. Have the water boiling 
when the egg is added. Keep the water bubbling very slowly. (For edible 
purposes it is better to keep the water below the boiling point after the egg is 
added, but the temperature of the water in different pans may vary widely. 
Hence, keeping the water boiling very slowly serves for comparative purposes.) 
Cook 3 minutes. Start with fresh water for each experiment. Break the egg 
into a sauce dish just before adding to the water. Slide it carefully into the 
water. Study the structure of one egg after it is broken out of the shell. Note 
the proportion of thick and thin white, for this will vary with different eggs. 
If very different in some individual eggs, cook and repeat one part of the 
experiment, to see if you get the same results the second time. Note the 
chalazae. Do any spots appear on the yolk? 

A. Fresh eggs. 

1. Cook in plain water. 

2. Add 94 teaspoon of salt per pint of water. 

3. Add 1 teaspoon of vinegar per pint of water. 

4. Decide which of the three experiments above gives the best-appearing 
product, then repeat it; but swirl the water around the pan, dropping the egg 
in the center. 

B. Eggs deteriorated so that they have a larger proportion of thin white. 

1. Repeat Al. 

2. Repeat A2. 

3. Repeat A3. 

4. Repeat A4. 

C. Repeat Al, using a ring placed in the bottom of the pan in which the egg 
is placed. Or use any type of cup made for poaching eggs. 

Which coagulates better, the thick or thin portions of the egg white? What 
is the effect of adding salt? Vinegar? Would the technic in swirling the water 
make any difference in the result? Why not swirl too hard? If eggs are 
cooked at a lower temperature, should the time be increased? 

Do you wish to try changing the proportion of salt? The time and tempera- 
ture of cooking?

Experiment 64. 

To determine the factors that affect the coagulation and curdling of 
custards. 
Recipe : 

Milk 1 cup 244 grams 

Egg 1 48 grams 

Sugar 2 tablespoons 25 grams 

A. To determine the effect of rate of coagulation upon the texture and 
consistency of custards. 

1. Prepare 2 times the recipe, then divide into equal parts; use part one 
for Al, and part two for A2. It is better for two or more students to 
work together for this experiment. Combine all the ingredients and mix thor- 
oughly. Put one part in the upper part of a double boiler. The boiler should 
be rather deep to have the custard sufficient to cover the thermometer bulb 
when portions of the custard are removed. A double boiler holding a quart 
and about 4 inches in depth is satisfactory. Add a pint of cold water to the 
lower part; then put the upper portion of the double boiler into the lower. 
Make a record of the temperature of the custard mixture and the time. Put 
over the fire and heat. The heating may be rapid until the custard mixture 
reaches a temperature of 70°C. Then the heat should be regulated so that at 
least 1 to 1^ or more minutes will be required to elevate the temperature 
1°C., i.e., about 3 minutes should be required for the temperature of the 
custard to go from 80° to 82°. One student may hold the thermometer and 
read the temperatures; a second can record the time and temperature. Record 
the time every 5° during the first period of heating, i.e., 30°, 35°, etc. But 
record the time for 1° rise after 78° is reached, i.e., at 78°, 79°, 80°, 81°, 
etc. A third student may stir the custard and a fourth can remove portions 
of the custard. It is easier to let the bulb of the thermometer touch the bot- 
tom in the center of the double boiler. Use a wooden spoon for stirring. 
Have dishes ready to put the custard in. Bend the bowl of an old metal spoon 
until it is at right angles to the handle. Use it for removing portions of the 
custard, taking out 2 tablespoons at each temperature. Remove portions of 
the custard at 78°, 80°, 82°, 84°, 86°, 88°, and when curdled. 



CUSTARDS 



379 



2. Repeat Al, but have the pint of water in the lower part of the double 
boiler boiling when the upper part is added. Regulate the heat to keep the 
water boiling very rapidly. Cook as quickly as possible, but not more than 
6 minutes should be necessary. Record the temperature of the custard and 
the time just before putting the custard over the boiling water. If possible, 
record the temperature as under Al. The stirring should be rather rapid 
for the cooking is rapid. It will also take rapid work to remove the custard 
at the desired temperatures. Remove portions of the custard at temperatures 
given under Al. 

Note the temperature before and during curdling of the slowly and rapidly 
cooked custards. 

Does the temperature lag or drop in some instances? Prepare a time- 
temperature chart, showing the period of time required for custard for 
different groups and time intervals as follows. It will be found that the con- 
sistency of a given custard at a definite temperature, say 80°C., is directly 
proportional to the time required to heat it from 76° to 80°C. Compare 
thickening of custard for different groups, noting time required for each 
custard to reach a definite temperature. Also note curdling temperature and 
highest temperature reached.

Compare the consistency of the custards at each temperature. What is the 
effect of the rate of coagulation upon the amount coagulated at a definite 
temperature? Would you advise the rapid or the slow cooking? Why? Com- 
pare with baked custards heated to the corresponding temperatures. 

B. Baked custards. 

Prepare 2 times the recipe. Combine all the ingredients and mix thoroughly. 
Divide into 5 portions, using equal parts in each cup. Put all the cups in a 
large, flat pan. Set the pan in the oven. By supporting on an oven rack above 
the custards insert a right-angled meat thermometer, so that the bulb of the 
thermometer is at the center of one custard. Place a second thermometer 
so that the temperature of the water can be read. Start heating the oven 
and then pour boiling water around the custard cups until it comes as high 
as the custard in the cups. If the oven has a regulator so that a low tempera- 
ture, 125° to 150°C. (250° to 300°F.) is maintained, the custards can be 
cooked without adding the water to the pan. Record the time and the tempera- 
ture of the custard every 3 minutes if the oven has a glass door, otherwise

every 5 minutes. Remove one custard of each series at the following tempera- 
tures: 82°, 83°, 84°, 85°, and 87°C. 

C. To determine the effect of varying the proportion of ingredients in baked 
custard. 

Follow directions under B. If possible, bake all the custards under B and 
C in the same pan. Prepare 2 times the recipe. 

1. Use 1 egg, 1 cup of milk, 2 tablespoons of sugar, or use the custards 
from B for a control. 

2. Use 1 egg, 1 cup of milk. 

3. Use 1 egg, 1 cup of milk, 4 tablespoons of sugar. 

4. Use \y2 eggs, 1 cup of milk, 2 tablespoons of sugar. 

Are all the custards for the same experiment of the same thickness or 
consistency? How might you account for this? Are the custards removed 
at 83 °C. all of the same consistency? Compare the time required for cook- 
ing. Does the increased egg result in a thicker custard than when 1 egg is 
used? Compare the stiffness of custards made with the whites and the yolks. 
What is the eifect of increasing the sugar? Which proportion of sugar is 
desirable for serving? Are any of the custards curdled? What is the optimum 
temperature for serving each custard?

Conclusions. 

D. To determine the effect of substituting yolks or whites for the whole 
egg. 

Follow directions under B. Prepare 2 times the amount given below. 

1. Use 2 yolks (36 grams), 1 cup of milk, 2 tablespoons of sugar. 

2. Use 2 whites (60 grams), 1 cup of milk, 2 tablespoons of sugar. 

Beat the whites only slightly before adding the milk. If beaten stiff they 
float on top of the milk and do not blend well with it. Also fill the cups to the 
same height as those containing the egg-yolk custard. Otherwise the larger 
quantity of egg-white custard will heat more slowly than the egg-yolk custard. 

When egg yolks are substituted for the whole egg in the custard, compare 
the stiffness of the custards with those made from the whole egg cooked to the 
same temperature. Compare the flavor. The color. Compare with custards 
made of egg white. 

E. To determine the factors that affect coagulation. 
Prepare ^ the recipe, using only 1 custard cup. 

1. Use 1 egg, 1 cup of distilled water, 2 tablespoons of sugar. 

2. Use 1 egg, 1 cup of distilled water, 2 tablespoons of sugar. Dissolve J/? 
teaspoon of calcium lactate in the distilled water before adding the tgg and 
sugar.

3. Use 1 egg, 1 cup of distilled water, 2 tablespoons of sugar. Bake until 
the temperature at which D2 sets is reached. Remove from the oven and 
add Yi teaspoon of calcium lactate that has been moistened in a tablespoon 
of distilled water. Stir. What happens? 

4. To 1 egg, 1 cup of distilled water, 2 tablespoons of sugar, add about 1/16 
teaspoon or less of aluminum or ferric chloride. Mix the ferric or aluminum 
chloride with the distilled water ; then add the beaten egg and the sugar. What 
happens when the egg is stirred in the mixture? Continue stirring for a few 
seconds. 

5. Repeat El, but add ^ teaspoon of aluminum or ferric chloride. Does the 
custard coagulate during cooking? Test the custards with litmus paper. 

6. To 1 egg, 1 cup of distilled water, and 2 tablespoons of sugar, add 34 
teaspoon of salt. 

7. Repeat E6, but omit the salt and add Yz teaspoon of a milk-salt mixture 
used in feeding rats. 

8. To 1 egg, 1 cup of distilled water, and 2 tablespoons of sugar, add ^ 
teaspoon of lemon juice. 

9. To 1 egg, 1 cup of distilled water, and 2 tablespoons of sugar, add 1 
teaspoon of lemon juice. 

F. To determine the effect of beating on thickening power of the egg. 

1. Use 2Y2 eggs. Beat in a bowl either by hand or with an electric mixer 
until the yolks and whites are well blended. Weigh out 48 grams and combine 
with 1 cup of milk and 2 tablespoons of sugar. 

2. Beat the egg remaining from part Fl until thoroughly beaten. The egg 
can be beaten as long a period as desired. Weigh 48 grams of the egg. Discard 
the remaining egg. Combine the 48 grams with 1 cup of milk and 2 table- 
spoons of sugar. If the egg was beaten with an electric mixer, put milk in the 
mixer bowl and combine with the mixer. Does the egg tend to float on top 
of the milk? Bake according to directions under B. 

3. Beat 1 egg slightly, so that the yolk and white are not well blended. Add 
to 1 cup of milk and 2 tablespoons of sugar. 

What is the effect of increasing the egg upon temperature of coagulation? 
Of varying the proportion of sugar? Does the distilled-water custard set? 
What is the effect of adding calcium lactate? Salt? What is the reaction of 
the custard containing the small proportion of aluminum or ferric chloride? 
The one with the larger proportion? Does either set? Unless the proportion 
of ferric or aluminum chloride is small enough, E4 may not set.

Omelets 

Experiment 67. 

To determine the factors that affect the texture of omelets. 
Recipe : 

Egg 1 Salt }/s teaspoon 

Liquid 1 tablespoon 15 cc. Butter }4 tablespoon 7 grams 

Directions for mixing and baking. 

The first omelets should not be used for comparisons for experiments. The 
omelets should be made over several times if necessary to acquire the technic 
and the manipulation necessary to make a good omelet. 

Separate the white and the yolk of the egg. Beat the yolk until it will mix 
well when folded in the white. Beat the white until it is frothy and add the 
liquid; add the salt and continue beating until it is quite stiff. It should be 
beaten until it will stay in an inverted bowl. 

Mix the beaten white and yolk by folding. Use a spatula for folding. The 
spatula should have a flexible blade near the end but should be rigid where 
it joins the handle. Fold by holding the blade of the spatula parallel to the 
right side of the bowl. Move to the bottom of the bowl, at the same time 
pressing so that the spatula scrapes the material from the bottom of the 
bowl. Bring up with the blade parallel to the left side of the bowl. As the 
spatula is brought across the top of the material turn it upside down. Turn 



384 



EGG COOKERY 



the bowl occasionally, and about every fifth stroke bring the spatula up 
through the middle of the material for better mixing. Fold white and yolk 
until well blended. They should not be mixed until a large portion of the 
air is lost from the white, but they must be mixed enough to prevent separa- 
tion of the white and yolk. Count the number of strokes used in mixing the 
yolk and white. The number needed will vary with the size and kind of 
utensil, usually about 20 to 25. The same number of strokes should be used 
in mixing for all the experimental work and also the same size and kind 
of utensils. If desired, different makes and styles of egg beaters and whisks can 
be used. Count the motions required to beat the egg whites to the same degree 
of stiffness. The butter is put In a frying pan or an omelet pan of the proper 
size for a one-egg omelet. Melt the butter In the pan. Add the omelet and 
cook over a medium flame for about ^ minute before placing In the oven. 
Have the temperature of the oven 160° to 165°C. (320°-330°F.). Oven baking 
is not necessary but It gives a uniform temperature for class work. Bake 25 
minutes. If necessary, increase or decrease the time of baking. See Fig. 36,

Meringues 

Experiment 68. 

To determine some of the factors affecting the desirability and texture of 
meringues. 

Recipe: ^ 

Egg whites 2 60 grams 

Sugar 4 tablespoons 50 grams 

Water (may be omitted) 2 teaspoons 

Salt % teaspoon 

Vanilla }i teaspoon 

Directions for mixing. 

.Beat the egg white until foamy, 50 turns of handle of rotary beater. Add 
the water, salt, vanilla, and beat an additional 100 turns with rotary beater. 
Add sugar and beat 50 turns with rotary beater. {Note. The sugar may be 
added gradually. If added in this manner, the amount of beating after addition 
of salt should be shortened. Ask instructor for directions. Change or adapt 
the extent of beating to suit the type of beater used, whether water is added, 
and the consistency of the egg white.) The above quantity of meringue should 
give enough for 4 pies about 6 inches in diameter. The meringues should be 
between ^ and 1^ inches in depth. Bake pastry. Fill shells with chocolate, 
lemon, or butterscotch filling as desired. Spread the meringue carefully over 
the filling to the edge of the crust, leaving it somewhat rough over the top. 
The meringue may be placed on a hot or cold filling. However, if added to a 
cold filling the time for baking will be longer, especially at the lower tempera- 
tures. When possible keep portions of the pie over night to observe the extent 
of leakage of the meringue. 

A. Temperature of baking. 

1. Bake at 230° C. (446° or 450° F. may be used) for 4 minutes. 

2. Bake at 215°C. (420° or 425°F. may be used) for 6 minutes.

Angel Cakes 

Experiment 69. 

To determine the factors that affect the texture of angel cake. 
Standard recipe: 

Egg whites 1 cup 244 grams 

Sugar Xyi cups 250 grams 

Cake flour 1 cup 100 grams 

Cream of tartar 1 teaspoon 3.6 grams 

Salt yi teaspoon 

Directions for mixing and baking. 

Bake 1/6 of the recipe for each experiment. Beat the egg whites until 
frothy, then add cream of tartar and salt. Continue beating until they are the 
desired stiffness. The peaks formed when the white follows the lifted beater 
stand up fairly stiff and the tip end is slightly rounded. Sift the sugar to 
remove lumps and large crystals so that it will dissolve readily when mixed 
with the egg white. The sugar is sprinkled over the top of the egg and then 
folded in with a spatula. See Experiment 67 for directions for folding. The 
class should use spatulas of the same size. An egg beater can be used to fold 
in the sugar, but if used all members of the class should use one, and the 
number of strokes may need to be changed according to the size of the egg 



ANGEL CAKES 387 

beater. The flour is sifted to remove all lumps so that it folds in readily with 
the mixed whites and sugar. If the sifter is a coarse one, sift the flour several 
times. The flour is sifted over the eggs, then folded in. Flavoring is omitted 
in the above recipe so that the flavor of ingredients is more distinct. When 
used it may be added with the cream of tartar, thus preventing excess fold- 
ing. To better compare the effect of other factors it is preferable to beat 
the egg whites together and then divide after they are beaten. Pans 2>4 by 2>^ 
by 5 inches will hold 1/6 of the above recipe. It is better to bake the whole 
recipe in a pan with an opening in the center to facilitate baking, but small 
portions bake well in a loaf. Let the baked cakes hang inverted in the pans 
until cool. 

A. To determine the amount of mixing of sugar to yield the best texture 
and volume. 

I. Standard method. 

Beat enough whites at one time for the whole recipe. Add the cream of 
tartar and salt. Divide into 6 parts, using 38 grams of the beaten white 
for each 1/6 of the recipe. Bake at 175°C. (347°F.). There should be several 
girls in this group. One girl should beat and weigh the egg whites. Each girl 
should do the same manipulation on each cake. Thus if one girl folds the 
first ^4 of the sugar, she should do this operation on each cake, but no more, 
and pass it on to the next girl. Two girls can fold the flour, the first adding 
3/5 and the other the remainder. 

1. Add approximately % of the sugar, sprinkling it over the top of the beaten 
egg. Fold 5 times with a spatula. Repeat for each ^4 of the sugar. This 
gives a total of 20 strokes for folding in all the sugar. 

Sift approximately 1/5 of the flour over the egg and sugar mixture. Fold 
with 5 strokes of spatula. Add another 1/5 of the flour and fold a total of 10 
strokes with the spatula. Add 1/5 of the flour and fold a total of 15 strokes. 
Add 1/5 of the flour and fold a total of 20 strokes. Add the last 1/5 of the 
flour and fold a total of 40 strokes. 

2. Repeat 1 but fold each 34 of the sugar 10 times with the spatula. 

3. Repeat 1 but fold each % of the sugar 15 times with the spatula. 

4. Repeat Al, but fold each Y^ of the sugar 20 times. 

5. Repeat Al, but fold each %. of the sugar 30 times. 

6. Repeat Al, but fold each ^ of the sugar 45 times with the spatula. 
What is the effect on the size of the cells and cell walls when the sugar 

is sufficiently mixed? When it is over-mixed? When it is insufficiently mixed? 
Can the flour be blended well if the sugar has not been sufficiently mixed? 
What is the effect on the texture and tenderness of longer mixing? 

II. The meringue method. 

Follow the same procedure as for Al, but do not beat the egg whites quite 
so stiff. The peaks should be soft and the tip end should round over readily. 
It may be necessary to decrease or increase each of the following parts by 
5 or more strokes, depending on the stiffness to which the egg white is beaten. 
If desired ^4 of the sugar may be sifted with the flour. Follow directions 
under AI,1 for folding the flour. Weigh out 38 grams of white for each part. 

1. Add 54 of the sugar to be beaten in the egg white. Beat the sugar into 
the egg whites using 10 turns of handle of rotary beater or 10 strokes of 
whisk for each 34 of the sugar.

Results and conclusions. 

B. To determine the amount of mixing of flour to give the best angel cake. 
Beat enough eggs at one time to make ^ of the full recipe. Add cream of 

tartar and salt for 3^ the full recipe. Divide the beaten egg white into three 
parts using 38 grams for each part. Use either the standard or meringue 
method of adding the sugar, with number of strokes found best under A. 
Divide the work so that each girl does the same manipulation on each cake. 

1. After adding the sugar, add the flour. Fold in with 40 strokes. Follow 
directions for folding flour under AI,1. 

2. Repeat Bl, but use 10 strokes to mix each 1/5 of the flour and a total 
of 60 strokes. 

3. Repeat Bl, but use 15 strokes to mix each 1/5 of the flour and a total 
of 80 strokes. 

What is the effect on the grain, the volume, and the tenderness of the 
cake when the flour is mixed too long? Can less than 35 strokes be used? 

C. To determine the effect of beating the egg whites to different stages 
of stiffness on the texture of the angel cake. 

Beat enough egg whites at one time to prepare ^4 of the full recipe. Add 
cream of tartar and salt for 3^ the full recipe. The first portion is to deter- 
mine the effect of too little beating of the white so that the egg white can 
be weighed with as little beating as desired. Weigh out 38 grams of the beaten 
white and use the remainder for 2 and 3. Divide the work so that each girl 
does the same operation on each cake. 

1. Add 34 oi the sugar. Add each % of the sugar with the number of 
strokes and method found best under A. Fold the flour with the number of 
strokes found best under B. 

2. Continue beating the egg white from CI, until it is about the same stiff- 
ness as that used under A and B. Weigh out 38 grams. 

Add the sugar and the flour as in CI. 



ANGEL CAKES 389 

3. Beat the remaining egg white from C2, until it is very stiff, dry, and 
flaky. Weigh out 38 grams. Add the sugar and the flour as in CI. 

Would longer mixing of the egg white in CI partially overcome the lack of 
sufficient beating of the egg whites? 

D. To determine the effect of varying the proportion of cream of tartar 
used in angel cake, and the method of adding the cream of tartar. 

1. Prepare 1/6 of the recipe for a control. Add the sugar by method and 
number of strokes found best under A and the flour with the number of 
strokes found best under B. 

2. Repeat Dl, but omit the cream of tartar. 

3. Repeat Dl, but increase the cream of tartar to 2 teaspoons for the full 
recipe. 

4. Repeat Dl, but omit adding the cream of tartar to the egg. Sift the flour 
and the cream of tartar together 2 or 3 times, before adding the flour to 
the egg and sugar mixture. 

E. To determine the effect of increasing the proportion of sugar used in 
the cake. (Formula II.) 

1. Increase the sugar for the full recipe to lyz cups. Beat enough egg 
whites for 3^ the full recipe. Add salt and cream of tartar for ^ the full 
recipe. Beat the egg whites by method and amount found best under A, but 
leave them slightly under-beaten. Add the flour with number of strokes found 
best under B. 

2. Beat the remainder of the egg whites from El, the amount used in 
other experiments. Weigh out 38 grams and repeat El. 

3. Beat the remainder of the egg white from E2, until very dry and flaky. 
Weigh out 42 grams. Repeat El. 

When the sugar in the recipe is increased, should the egg white be beaten 
longer to coagulate a larger proportion, thus giving greater rigidity to hold 
the added sugar, or does over-beating lessen the rigidity of the egg white? 
What would be the effect of increasing the mixing of the sugar and the egg 
white? May the flour be increased to 107 grams when the sugar is increased 
to 1^ cups? 

F. To determine the effect of reducing the proportion of flour in the stand- 
ard recipe. 

Reduce the flour for full recipe to 90 grams. Prepare 1/6 the recipe. Use 
meringue or standard method or both for beating eggs, beating an amount to 
give a desirable cake. Add flour as found best under B. If you think it advisable 
repeat the experiment reducing the flour to 80 grams. 

G. To determine the effect of different baking temperatures. 

Prepare ^ the full recipe following directions under F and using amount 
of flour found most desirable. Divide the batter into 3 equal portions. Bake 
one cake at 160°C. (320°F.), the second at 175°C. (357°F.), and the third 
at 190°C. (375°F.). 

H. Use formula III, p. 360. Use any or all methods that may yield a 
palatable cake. Compare volume, texture and tenderness with cakes from the 
standard recipe.

CHAPTER XI 
FLOUR AND BREAD 

The composition of wheat may vary with several factors, such as varying 
rainfall, temperature, and other climatic conditions, irrigation, texture and 
composition of the soil, and the use of fertilizers. Bailey reviews all these 
factors and others in "The Chemistry of Wheat Flour." 

The kind of flour and to a great degree its composition depend upon 
(1) the milling process, (2) the classes of wheat from which the flour is 
milled, and (3) the purpose for which the flour is intended. Flour is also 
made from rye, buckwheat, barley, corn, rice, potatoes, bananas, lima 
beans, cottonseed, and soybeans, but the term flour refers to wheat flour 
when no grain or product is mentioned. 

The milling process and the structure o£ wheat. The wheat 
kernel may be divided into three main parts: the bran, the germ, and the 
endosperm, the relative proportion of each part of the entire kernel being 
respectively about 14.5, 1.5, and 84 per cent. Milling is the process of 
separation of the endosperm from the bran and germ. When no separation is 
made, or all the flour streams are reunited, the flour is known as whole- 
wheat flour, but otherwise the completeness of separation determines the 
resulting grade of flour. If the separation is so complete that only the 
heart of the endosperm is used, the resulting flour may be called a ''fancy" 
or ''short" patent. In general, only about 72 to 75 per cent of the endo- 
sperm is obtained in white flour, the remainder constituting bran and 
shorts. Between the two extremes of flour, whole-wheat and fancy patent, 
are many other varieties. 

The steps in the milling process may include the following: cleaning, 
tempering, breaking, sifting, or separating the primary products, purifying, 
reducing, bolting, flour blending, and bleaching. 

The structure of the wheat berry is shown in Fig. 42. Layer No. 1, some- 
times called the bee's wings by millers, the hairs, and the dirt on the berry, 
particularly that in the crease, are removed in the cleaning operations pre- 
paratory to milling. Layers No. 2 to No. 6, shown in the surface drawing, 
and the longitudinal and cross sections constitute the bran coats. 

The gross appearance of a cross section of a wheat berry varies some- 
what with the type of wheat and the ripening conditions. Hard wheats 
are more flinty and vitreous than soft wheats. The proportion of gluten is 
usually higher in hard than in soft wheats, and the gluten forms a con- 
tinuous matrix in which the starch granules are imbedded. When the grain 
contains a large proportion of gluten, the starch granules, as it dries out in 

391

back from the kernel. The portion from which the different flours are obtained 
is shown in the longitudinal section. 



THE MILLING PROCESS 393 

ripening, are more firmly cemented to or held in the gluten matrix. In 
milling the vitreous wheats naturally tend to yield coarser particles and less 
free starch granules than soft wheats, unless the hard wheats are deliber- 
ately ground fine. If the weather is hot and dry after flowering of the 
wheat, a larger proportion of gluten and less starch are laid down in the 
kernel. It is known that vitreous barley has smaller starch granules than 
soft barley, and it is probable that this also applies to wheat. 

In contrast to hard wheats, the soft wheats have air spaces throughout 
the endosperm. The endosperm is quite friable and naturally breaks into 
smaller particles in milling. 

Tempering consists of adding a definite amount of water at a certain 
temperature to wheat berries, the proportion of water added depending on 
the moisture content of the wheat and other factors such as relative 
plumpness and hardness of the kernels. In tempering wheat the water is 
usually not left in contact with the wheat long enough for moisture to be 
absorbed by the endosperm. Thus the pliableness and toughness of the bran 
coats are increased so that they are more easily separated from the endo- 
sperm. Sometimes, to prevent the endosperm from breaking into very fine 
particles, the water is added in two portions, part of the first addition being 
absorbed by the endosperm. 

The germ because of its high fat content is easily flattened or flaked and 
is removed by bolting from the other constituents of the wheat berry during 
milling. The endosperm constitutes about 80 per cent of the wheat berry. 
The starch is more concentrated in the immediate vicinity of the germ and 
in the interior of the endosperm. The concentration becomes less and less 
towards the outer layers of the wheat berry. The starchy endosperm being 
drier and more friable tends to shatter more readily when the berries are 
fractured or broken between rollers. 

In the first breaks, the wheat kernels are mostly broken into large frag- 
ments by the corrugated rollers. The coarser fragments, which are sepa- 
rated from the finer ones by sifting, are returned to the next set of break 
rolls of which there are 5 or 6. Other things being equal, a larger pro- 
portion of fine particles is obtained from soft wheat than from hard wheat 
during the first breaks. 

Bolting or sifting, which occurs after each break, is the separation of 
the coarse particles, which are reground, fine granules of flour, which are 
not reground, and intermediate particles, which are sent to the purifier. 

Purifying refers to a part of the milling process whereby particles pass 
over a sloping, vibrating sieve. At the entrance the meshes of the sieve are 
fine but gradually increase in size to the discharge end. As the particles 
travel down this sieve they are separated according to size. During this 
process controlled air currents lift out the flakier and more fibrous particles. 
The remainder of the particles, known as purified middlings because they 
are freer from branny, fibrous material, yield a more highly refined flour 
after reduction. 



394 FLOUR AND BREAD 

The purified middlings are ground between smooth iron rollers to re- 
duce them to the desired fineness. Since the flour bolted from the first 
grinding of any stream of purified middlings is more highly refined, be- 
cause it is freer of fiber than that produced by subsequent grinding of the 
coarser residues, it is often used in making the so-called "short" patent 
flours. 

In separating the endosperm from the rest of the wheat berry and re- 
ducing it to flour, some small bran particles are broken from the bran coats. 
As these particles are formed they are separated from the flour stock and 
may be graded according to size and included in the various feeds. As it is 
impossible to prevent some flour particles' being removed with the bran, 
these flour particles may also be graded according to size and may become 
part of the feeds. The other portions into which the wheat berry may be 
separated, in order as the percentage of bran particles increases, are First 
Clear, Second Clear, Red Dog, Flour Middlings, Shorts, and Bran. 

Classes of wheats used for flour. Wheats are classified in five main 
groups as follows: (1) white, (2) hard red spring, (3) hard red w^inter, 
(4) soft red winter, and (5) durum. Since the composition of the w^heat 
varies with climatic and soil conditions to which it has been subjected in 
growing, it is natural that many variations in composition occur within 
each class. The sections in which the different classes of wheat are grown 
overlap to a greater or less degree. The major portion of the hard red 
spring wheat and durum wheat is grown in the North Central States of 
the United States and in Canada, whereas hard red winter wheat is grown 
chiefly in the South Central and Middle Central States. This class of 
wheat leads all others grown in Iowa, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, 
and Colorado. At present twice as much acreage is planted in hard red 
winter wheat as in any other class of wheat. Soft red winter wheat is 
grown in Missouri and the eastern half of the United States. It is also 
grown in some Western States, particularly Oregon, Washington, and 
Idaho. White wheat is grown to a limited extent in the northeastern part of 
the United States and in Michigan, New York, and on the Pacific Coast. 

Flour terminology. Flour terminology had become confusing but as 
a result of the work of the committee on terminology of the Millers' 
National Federation, in cooperation with the U. S. Department of Agri- 
culture, definitions for labeling have been worked out and progress has 
been made in clarifying the terminology. It has been suggested that grade 
be used to refer to the type of flour as determined by the milling process, 
whereas the word class be used to designate the kind of wheat from which 
the flour is milled. According to such a plan, grades of flour would be 
patent, clear, etc. ; classes would be durum, hard- and soft-wheat flours. 

Definition of flour. The definition of flour is from the Definitions and 
Standards for Food Products of the Service and Regulatory Announce- 
ments of the U. S. Department of Agriculture, issue of 1933. 

"Whole-wheat flour, entire-wheat flour, graham flour, is the product 



TYPES OF FLOURS 395 

made by grinding wheat, and contains, in their natural proportions, all of 
the constituents of the cleaned grain." 

Harrell and Benson state that whole-wheat flour may be of coarse, 
medium, or fine granulation. 

"Flour, wheat flour, white flour, is the fine-ground product obtained in 
the commercial milling of wheat, and consists essentially of the starch and 
gluten of the endosperm. It contains not more than 15 per cent moisture, 
not less than 1 per cent nitrogen, not more than 1 per cent ash, and not 
more than 0.5 per cent fiber." 

Straight flour. Straight flour (100% flour) is a milling term indicating 
that all the bolted wheat meal has been recovered from the wheat after 
removal of the feeds. It is not generally on the market and all commercial 
flours are derived from straight flour. 

Patent flour. Patent flour may be made from any class of wheat and is 
the more refined portion of the wheat meal from which all or a portion of 
the clears have been removed. (How "long" or "short" a patent is depends 
on how much of the total flour is included. In general, most patent flours 
include about 85 per cent of the total flour obtained from the wheat. But 
a very "short" patent used in fancy cake flour may include only 25 per cent 
of the total flour.) 

Clear flour. Clear flour is the less refined bolted portion of the wheat 
meal recovered in the manufacture of Patent flour. According to trade 
practise or demand, clear flour may be divided into First and/or Second 
Clears. 

First Clear is the better portion of the Clear when separated into two 
parts. 

Second Clear is the remaining portion of the Clears when First Clear 
is removed. 

The purpose for which the flour is intended. Hard-wheat flours. 
Practically all durum wheat is used for the manufacture of semolina, 
which in turn is used for macaroni products. 

In general bread flours are made from hard wheats, although suitable 
soft-wheat flour is used for baking bread in some sections. Bread flour is 
a term indicating a "strong" flour that has the capacity to make loaves of 
good volume texture and grain. The term "strong" indicates that the gluten 
has tenacity, cohesiveness, and elasticity. Bread flour usually contains more 
gluten and less starch, and the granulation is usually coarser than in either 
pastry or cake flour. 

All-purpose, General-purpose, or Family flour are synonymous terms 
used for a flour which is suitable for most kinds of baking. It may or may 
not be a blended flour. It may have as a basis either hard- or soft-wheat 
flour. Hence, there are two types of all-purpose flours, and which is obtain- 
able in a certain section depends on whether hard or soft wheat predomi- 
nates in that section. 

Soft-wheat flours. Since soft wheats usually contain a smaller quantity of 



396 FLOUR AND BREAD 

gluten than hard wheats, the flours from these wheats are generally more 
desirable, and particularly if the gluten is of fine quality, for cakes and 
pastry products than hard-wheat flours. 

Pastry flour is a term indicating a flour usually milled from soft wheat, 
which is of fine granulation and has a low or moderate amount of gluten. 
It differs in baking quality from both bread and cake flours. 

Cake flour is milled from soft wheat. It is a "short" patent. The granula- 
tion is very fine and uniform, the protein content is low but may be of 
fine quality. Cake flours are usually better grades of flour than pastry 
flours. 

Cracker flour is milled from soft winter wheat. Micka states that be- 
cause it constitutes nearly 90 per cent of the cracker it is largely responsible 
for the general character of the finished product. A desirable cracker flour 
differs from bread flour in color, absorption, and fermentation capacities. 
Because of the long fermentation period the inside color of crackers is quite 
uniform but the color of the flour affects the outside color and bloom of 
the cracker. A cracker flour has a lower water-absorbing capacity than 
bread flour and, since little sugar is added, the flour must itself furnish 
the necessary fermentative material. 

The geographical areas in which the different classes of wheat are grown 
determine to a great extent the type of flour that predominates in local 
retail markets in these areas. For example, in Iowa it is very difl&cult to 
obtain soft-wheat flour, except in the specially prepared cake flours, the 
bread and all-purpose hard-wheat flours being found on the local markets. 
In Alabama it is just as difficult to obtain hard-wheat flours. In some sec- 
tions or states both soft- and hard-wheat flours are readily obtainable. 

Bleaching of flour. Bleaching can occur through aging or gradual oxida- 
tion of the carotene, but a large portion of flour is bleached at the mills in 
a short time. Nitrogen peroxide or chlorine, benzoyl peroxide or nitrogen 
trichloride, or a combination of two of these, is used for bleaching. 

Rye Flour 

The Service and Regulatory Announcements define rye flour as "the 
fine-ground product made by bolting rye meal, and contains not more 
than 13.5 per cent moisture, not less than 1.36 per cent nitrogen, and not 
more than 1.25 per cent ash." 

Bailey has reported formulas and methods for testing the use of rye flour 
in bread. There are five classes of rye flour, based largely on the color: 
white, light, medium, dark, and extra dark. 

Composition of Flour 

Flour contains pigments, enzymes, cellulose, moisture, fat, mineral salts, 
carbohydrates, and proteins. All the constituents of flour are important in 



DIASTASES 397 

that all affect the baking qualities of the flour and thus the product in which 
the flour is used. 

Color of Flour 

Bailey states that the color of flour is due to five factors : ( 1 ) Granula- 
tion or size of flour particles, which affects the appearance of the flour and 
not that of the dough. Large granules appear darker than small ones. 

(2) Color changes due to mixing with water in contact with air at ele- 
vated temperatures are caused by enzymes found principally in the bran. 

(3) Dirt and foreign matter, as weed seeds, if highly pigmented, may 
become pulverized and color the flour. (4) A reddish-brown pigment is 
present in small quantities in flour made from "red" wheats. Highly re- 
fined flours from those wheats show less of these small bran particles 
containing the pigments. 

(5) Carotinoid pigments. Flour contains the pigment carotene which 
gives it a creamy or yellow tint, the depth of color depending upon the 
amount of the pigment present. Because of the fineness of division of the 
flour particles its bulk includes a large proportion of air. The carotene is 
bleached by oxidation ; thus, in aging, natural bleaching of the flour occurs. 
Markley and Bailey have reported that flour contains the following fat- 
soluble pigments: carotene, xanthophyll, and an unknown pigment. 

(6) Flavones, The flavones are water-soluble pigments. Markley and 
Bailey state that flavones have long been known to exist as glucosides and 
from their study it appears possible that they will be found as esters of the 
fatty acids. The flavones are colorless in acid or neutral mediums but 
develop a greenish yellow tint in alkaline reactions. 

Enzymes 

Wheat and flour contain many enzymes, some of which are important 
because of their action during fermentation of cracker and bread doughs. 
Others become active in the sprouted grain, hence affect bread making only 
rarely when some sprouted grain is included with sound wheat in milling. 
Of the numerous enzymes, the diastases or amylases and the proteinases are 
the most important from the standpoint of baking. 

Diastases. Andrews and Bailey state that the chief function of the 
starch enzymes of wheat and flour is changing starch to sugars. In sound 
normal wheat and flour the diastatic activity is due primarily to the action 
of beta-amylase. When wheat germinates, a second "diastatic factor," termed 
alpha-amylase, is produced. Accompanying the activation of alpha-amylase 
are the phenomena of dextrination and liquefaction. Both amylases convert 
starch to reducing sugars, the alpha-maltase yielding alpha-maltose and 
the beta-amylase producing the corresponding beta sugar. The maximum 



398 FLOUR AND BREAD 

activity of beta-amylase occurs at pH 4.5 to 5.1, whereas that of alpha- 
amylase is at pH 5.6 to 5.8. 

Proteinases. Until lately little was known about the proteolytic enzymes 
of flour except that they brought about hydrolysis of flour proteins. Balls 
and Hale have not only reported a method for estimating the proteolytic 
enzymes in flour but also the action of these enzymes. They state alteration 
of flour that takes place in bleaching and storage in air is due to a diminu- 
tion of the proteolytic activity, brought about by the oxidation of the 
activator of the flour proteinase. j0rgensen states that wheat flour contains 
powerful proteolytic enzymes which are usually latent but activators such 
as glutathione or yeast-water stimulate these proteinases of flour. Such sub- 
stances as KBrOs and ascorbic acid, because they depress the activity of 
the proteinase, have been found to be good improvers of baking strength of 
wheat flour. J0rgensen has applied for a patent in the United States for 
such a use of ascorbic acid. 

Cellulose 

The greater part of the cellulose of the wheat kernel is removed in 
milling, so that the amount in white flour is small. 

Bran. Bran contains considerable cellulose and cellulose absorbs water 
slowly. Rahn describes the Schlueter process by which bran is steeped in 
hot water and treated for some time with moist heat. During this treat- 
ment the cellulose membranes are sufficiently hydrolyzed so that the cell 
contents are more readily digestible. The bran is then dried and put 
through a crusher and a fine grinding mill. In contrast to ordinary bran, 
the treated bran is said to keep indefinitely and absorbs water more readily 
and in larger quantity. 

The Moisture Content of Flour 

Flour has been considered adulterated w^ith water, under the federal 
standards of the United States, if the moisture content exceeded 13.5 per 
cent. Recently this standard has been changed to 15 per cent. It has been 
found by careful experiments that, when the moisture is determined by 
the water-oven method, 13.5 per cent is equivalent to 15 per cent by the 
new vacuum method. 

Sanderson, in determining the variations in moisture content of flour 
during storage, decided that the moisture loss of flour varies less with 11.0 
per cent of moisture. From different reports 11 to 13 per cent of moisture 
seems to be a normal content of flour over a large section of the United 
States. 

Bailey states that flour responds more readily to changes in humidity 
than the wheat kernel, because of its fineness of division of particles and 
the greater exposure in handling it in sacks. 



FAT CONTENT OF FLOUR 399 

Hygroscopic property of flour. The starch of flour takes up and lets 
go of moisture very quickly. This affects the proportion of moisture needed 
for baked products such as bread and cake. Browne in determining the 
hygroscopic moisture of carbohydrates has reported that anhydrous starch 
ranked first in the amount of moisture absorbed at 60 per cent humidity 
in 1 hour. Over longer periods the starch did not absorb as much moisture 
as some of the sugars. Kent-Jones states that English flour has a moisture 
content ^ to 1 per cent higher than American flour on account of the 
higher humidity of the English climate. 

The Fat Content of Flour 

The percentage of fat in vrhite flour is low, since most of the fat is found 
in the germ which is removed during milling. But though present in a small 
quantity, the lipoid content of flour is important. Some lipoid constituents 
improve, whereas others injure the baking quality of flour. 

Working has reported that "The gluten of low grade flour increased in 
tenacity when the phosphatide was removed by washing. The addition of 
phosphatides to flour in small quantities injured the gluten as determined 
by the feel of the hand washed gluten, the viscosity as measured by the 
viscometer, and by baking tests." Working suggests that the effect of 
phosphatides on gluten is similar to that of oil on rope. Lubrication of the 
strands of the rope lessens its strength and tenacity. 

In a later paper Working reported that a small amount of phosphatide, 
such as the normal amount present in a good patent flour, may improve 
the baking quality. 

Sullivan, Near, and Foley report that it is well known that increasing 
percentages of wheat germ in flour harm the baking quality of the flour. 
They investigated the effect of fat from wheat germ and of each fat fraction 
and its hydrolytic products on normal sound patent flour as judged by 
gluten washing and baking tests as well as by the Farinograph and Fer- 
mcntograph. Fat from the fresh germ was not found to be deleterious to 
the baking quality. 

They say: "The only germ-fat constituents which were found to be 
injurious were the unsaturated fatty acids which develop upon aging due 
to hydrolysis of the triglycerides and, what is much more important, the 
subsequent oxidation products of these unsaturated acids. 

"Higher saturated fatty acids (which may occur in small amounts in 
any wheat product as a result of hydrolysis of the triglycerides) have only 
a very slight 'shortening' effect on the flour-water curves. Unsaturated fatty 
acids (oleic, linolic, and linolenic) cause a decided change in the shape of 
the curves and produce 'short' tough glutens when added to patent flour. 
These unsaturated acids, however, are only slightly detrimental to the 
baking quality of a flour. The bake is not harmed as much as one would 
expect from the feeling of the gluten."

FLOUR AND BREAD 



The effect of unsaturated fatty acids on flour is in direct correlation with 
their' increasing number of double bonds. The oxidation products of these 
unsaturated fatty acids have a significant damaging effect on the baking 
quality of flour. 

In addition, these investigators have shown that extracting fat from flour 
with ether injures the baking quality of both strong and weak flours. The 
addition of flour fat brought the quality of the ether-extracted flour back 
to normal but the addition of germ fat did not. They concluded that this 
indicated that flour fat contains some constituent or groups of compounds 
necessary for good baking quality of flour, which are absent in the germ 
lipoids. 

The Ash Content o£ Flour 

Sullivan found that the total ash content of wheat averaged 1.86 per 
cent. In general the ash content of a flour increases as more of the wheat 
kernel is used. Whole-wheat flour contains all the ash of the wheat, and 
patent flour contains the smallest percentage of total ash. Patent flour may 
contain as low as 0.25 to 0.3 per cent of total ash. Sullivan gives the 
inorganic constituents present in relatively larger quantities in flour as 
shown in Table 45 :

Phosphorus is found in inorganic combination and in organic combina- 
tion in phytin, nucleic acid, and lipoids. 

Sullivan states that potassium probably has some direct bearing in the 



ASH CONTENT OF FLOUR 401 

translocation of sugars and starch formation and that a potassium deficiency 
influences the respiration rate of plants and may have some role in the 
activity of diastatic enzymes. 

Magnesium is found in excess of calcium in plants, whereas the reverse 
is true of animal tissues. It is present in chlorophyll and Sullivan states that 
it takes some part in the transfer of phosphoric acid through plant tissues. It 
may exist in the wheat pericarp as the magnesium salt of inositiol phos- 
phoric acid. It is found in larger quantity in stronger wheats than in 
weaker wheats, and there is a correlation between the percentage of mag- 
nesium and protein content. 

Calcium is essential for the growth of plants. It is present in both inor- 
ganic and organic combination. Sullivan states plants deficient in calcium are 
unable to assimilate nitrates and accumulate carbohydrates in large quanti- 
ties. Sullivan and Near have reported the potassium, calcium, magnesium, 
and phosphorus content of glutens in three grades of flour. Their investiga- 
tion shows that the calcium content is highest in glutens of highest strength, 
and potassium and magnesium increase as the tenacity of the gluten 
decreases. 

Calcium acid phosphate is often added to soft-wheat flour and some- 
times to high grades of flour. This practise is very common in the South. 
A great deal of this flour is used in quick breads like biscuits. The addition 
of the calcium acid phosphate is said to improve the volume, quality of 
crumb, texture, and color of biscuits. 

Sullivan states that the inorganic constituents — iron, manganese, copper, 
zinc, boron, cobalt, iodine, flourine, and nickel — all play a significant role 
in plant physiology. The addition of certain of these rare minerals, in as 
little concentration as one part per million, to nutrient solutions in which 
plants are grown permits normal growth and production, although too 
great a concentration of some of these elements has undesirable effects. 

Gericke studied the effect on bread scores of supplying to wheat grown 
in liquid media the following salts during the latter part of the growth 
period: NH4NO3, Ca(N03)2, KNO3, Mg(N03)2, and NaN03. He 
decided the physical state of the protein was determined by the nature of 
the salt solution surrounding the protein during its synthesis and transloca- 
tion in the grain. Quality in bread varies with the quantity and quality of 
the protein in the flour. Bread from flour of wheat grown in Ca(N03)2 
scored exceptionally high. The order in decreasing desirability of scores for 
bread was: Ca(N03)2, KNO3, NaN03, Mg(N03)2, and NH4NO3, 
though there was little difference between sodium and magnesium. How- 
ever, the ammonium nitrate was definitely the lowest-scoring bread. 

Gericke found that the effect of chloride salts supplied to wheat grown 
in liquid media on bread scores was in the following order, the highest 
being given first: CaCb, NaCL, MgCb, and KCl. The best bread was 
obtained from the wheat supplied with NH4CI, but this was the only salt 



402 FLOUR AND BREAD 

supplying nitrogen and hence the only wheat which gave a flour with a 
high protein content. 

Sugars 

Sugar. Flour contains small amounts of sugars. The content of maltose 
is from Yz to 1 per cent. The amount of sucrose averages approximately 
1 per cent but may reach 2 to 3 per cent. Dextrose may not be present 
in the flour but is found in bread dough. Dextrin is present in the flour 
in very small quantities. 

Starch 

Uses. Starch, either alone or in flour, of which it may compose as 
much as 75 per cent and averages 65 to 70 per cent, is used in cookery : for 
thickening, as in soups and sauces; to form molded gels, i.e., cornstarch 
puddings and similar desserts; and, because hydrated starch has adhesive 
qualities, as a cementing or binding material for holding pieces of food 
together in the sauce base of croquettes and in the framework of such 
baked products as muffins, biscuits, cakes, and breads. Hence its charac- 
teristics of special interest in food preparation are its gel-forming properties. 
Alsberg (Wheat Studies) has given an excellent review of the role of 
starch in bread making. 

Sources of starch. Most of the starches and starchy foods used in 
food preparation are obtained from the cereals : rice, barley, rye, corn, 
and wheat. Starch is also obtained from tubers, potatoes and sweet potatoes 
being the principal sources. In addition tapioca, arrowroot, cassava, and 
some other starches are used to a limited extent. 

Starch from different sources varies in size, shape, and properties. Some 
starches are more suitable for some purposes than others. Some of these 
differences are in thickening capacity, adhesiveness, ease and rate of hydra- 
tion, and rate of hydrolysis by diastase. Samec states there are two possible 
explanations for these differences. ( 1 ) It may be supposed that starch is a 
homogeneous substance existing in many different colloidal conditions and 
(2) it may be assumed that starch is a heterogeneous system built up from 
a polysaccharide (or several kindred polysaccharides) together with inor- 
ganic or organic substances which accompany it. Under the first condition 
the properties would result because of different colloidal conditions and 
under the second condition the components with the starch would modify 
its properties. 

Size and shape of starch granules. Sjostrom has published excel- 
lent photomicrographs of the natural and gelatinized starch granules. 
Butcher gives excellent descriptions, and Scott gives both descriptions and 
illustrations. Starch is laid down as discrete particles called granules. Many 



SIZE AND SHAPE OF STARCH GRANULES 



403 



granules are compound, i.e., composed of aggregates of 2 to 25 or more 
granules. Some starch granules have a characteristic black spot called the 
hilum, which is an air space visible microscopically as a black spot. The 
hilum, even in varieties in which it is a definite characteristic, is not always 
present in all granules. In some starches distinct concentric markings or 
striations occur which are visible because certain portions of the granules 
contain less water and thus are denser than other portions. Naturally the 
size and to a certain extent the shape will vary with the growing condi- 
tions, so that sizes reported in the literature vary considerably. 




Fig. 43. — A photomicrograph of flour with enough water so that it will stick to 
the slide. Note that the starch granules are both oval and round. Magnification 
approximately x 100. 

Wheat granules are of two shapes and sizes. They are embedded in a 
more or less continuous matrix of gluten, a relatively larger number of 
the granules being free or not embedded in the gluten of soft-wheat than 
in hard-wheat flours. Larger granules average 25 to 35 microns in diame- 
ter and are oval and lenticular (bun shape, being flatter on one side). 
The small granules are circular and average about 3 to 5 microns. The 
hilum may show as a circular spot, and striations if present are faintly 
visible in large granules only. 

Rice starch is composed of aggregates of granules, though the polygonal 
(angular) granules are all small, 3 to 8 microns. No striations are visible 
and the hilum is stellate and visible only at high magnification. 

Cornstarch granules are, according to the variety, polygonal or round. 
The size averages 10 to 25 microns and few aggregates are found. The 



404 FLOUR AND BREAD 

hilum is stellate and in the center, and sometimes shows as a crack. Stria- 
tions are very indistinct. 

Potato starch granules vary in size, the large ones being egg or oyster- 
shaped, the small ones usually circular. The diameter is usually 60 to 100 
microns but may vary from 15 to 100 microns. The hilum is an annular 
or circular spot at the narrow end of the granule. The striations are usually 
very distinct in large granules, somewhat ring-shaped with wider spacing 
at the broad end. 

Constitution o£ starch. A perusal of the literature of starch chem- 
istry shows no unanimity of opinion in regard to the naming of the starch 
components, their number, nor some of their properties. However, it should 
be remembered that starch, as it is found in the plant tissues, is only one of 
many other components. It is separated from these other components by 
physical means and often, when the chemist starts to work with it, is a 
modified starch, the modification occurring through physical or chemical 
treatment. 

Starch may occur as free starch or combined with phosphoric acid, with 
phosphorus and protein, or with free fatty acids. Samec states silicic acid 
is always present in starch. Many of the properties and characteristics of 
starch vary with its constitution. 

The starch molecule. There seems to be agreement that cellulose is com- 
posed of beta-glucopyranose units, whereas starch is composed of alpha- 
glucopyranose units linked into a continuous chain. The terminal units of 
such a chain differ, because of their position, from one another and from 
the other units in the chain. One terminal unit should have reducing 
powers, just as glucose has reducing power; but the greater the number of 
glucose units combined as in starch, the less the relative reducing power 
should be. There is no agreement as to the number of glucose units con- 
stituting starch. Haworth states that he believes the chemical unit of 
starch to be composed of about 30 glucose units. However, he adds that 
these chemical units must aggregate to form physical units of much larger 
size. Richardson, Higginbotham, and Farrow have reported that the aver- 
age chain length of starch varies from 460 to 1470 glucose units. Still 
longer chains than these have been reported. 

In general the longer the starch chain the less its solubility. Very short 
chains broken from a long starch chain, i.e., glucose and maltose, or short 
chains of these units, are completely soluble. Dextrins, which according to 
Haworth may be composed of 12, 16, 17, or 18 glucose units, are more 
soluble than starch and give reddish colors with iodine. The paste- or gel- 
forming characteristics are also affected by the chain length, shorter chain 
products having less and less ability to form pastes. 

Alpha- and beta-amylose. Generally starch is said to be composed of two 
substances, though sometimes more are listed, a soluble portion and a more 
insoluble one. Samec says there is a continuous transition between the 
soluble and less soluble portions. The nomenclature used for these two 



CONSTITUT^ OF STARCH 405 

substances is varied and confusing both in the earlier and in the present-day 
literature. Thus at present the terms most often used for the more insoluble 
fraction are alpha-amylose, a mylbpectin, and amylo-cellulose, whereas the 
soluble portion is designated as beta-amylose or just amylose. The propor- 
tion of alpha- and beta-amyJose varies in starches from different sources, 
and even in different samples from the same species. In addition, different 
methods of separating the two fractions and different pre-treatment of the 
starches would undoubtedly lead to varying relative proportions' being 
reported by different investigators. In starch pastes or solutions the beta- 
amylose often changes back to the insoluble form, a process called retro- 
gradation. Richardson, Higginbotham, and Farrow state that natural or 
"unmodified starches contain chains of varying lengths and it appears 
plausible to suggest that the shorter, more easily soluble chains constitute 
the amylose (beta-amylose) fraction, whereas the longer chains make up 
the amylopectin (alpha-amylose). The amylose retrogrades because the 
original separation has been made on material not in equilibrium or at such 
a temperature that on cooling or concentrating its solutions the solubility 
of some of the chains is exceeded and precipitation must follow. Amylo- 
pectin does not retrograde because it is already precipitated, though heavily 
hydrated." Thus differences in starch gels might be expected at boiling 
and room temperatures because the solubility of the soluble starch increases 
with higher temperatures. 

There is evidence that in natural or unmodified starches not more than 
20 per cent of the starch and often less is soluble, though this varies with 
the source of the starch. 

Many investigators have reported that alpha-amylose is the starch com- 
ponent to which paste-forming properties of starch gels are due, but others 
have reported that beta-amylose imparts the mucilaginous qualities. 

Phosphoric acid. Samec states that in some species of plants both alpha- 
and beta-amylose are combined with phosphoric acid; in starches from 
other species these two components are linked with nitrogen and phos- 
phorus. Other investigators have reported that the phosphorus is combined 
with only the alpha-amylose fraction. Alsberg states that in wheat starch 
the phosphorus is found only with the alpha-amylose fraction. 

Alsberg states that Fernback found that small granules of potato starch 
contained a larger proportion of phosphoric acid than the larger granules, 
but this proportion has not been determined for wheat and some other 
starches. 

Samec states: "Esterification with phosphoric acid, thus introducing a 
group with ability to ionize, greatly increases the hydration capacity and 
does not essentially decrease the tendency to association. 

''If a starch paste be heated under pressure to 120°C., the high viscosity 
of the paste, the proportion of the undialysable phosphoric acid, the quan- 
tity of substance which can be transported by the electric current in a given 
time, and the precipitability by alcohol diminish, whilst the electrical con- 



406 FLOUR AND BREAD 

ductivity of the solution rises but the magnitude of the molecular aggregates 
does not change in the same degree." 

Therefore Samec believed there was some correlation between the phos- 
phoric acid content and the high viscosity of starch pastes. Hence he tried 
phosphating potato amylose with the following result : 

P2O5 Relative viscosity of Color with 

content a 1-per cent solution iodine 

Amylose 0.00 1.008 Pure blue 

Phosphated amylose 2.06 43.1 Pure blue 

From these results it appears that phosphoric acid may have some rela- 
tion to the viscosity of starch pastes. Other factors affecting viscosity will 
be discussed later. 

Fatty acids. Taylor and Morris make a further distinction between the 
two starch fractions from the fact that the insoluble residue carries certain 
high molecular-weight fatty acids combined with its carbohydrate. This 
insoluble fraction is called alpha-amylose and the soluble fatty-acid free 
portion is designated as beta-amylose. In potato starch pastes or solutions 
all the starchy material may be dispersed and, because potato starch con- 
tains no fatty acids, Taylor and associates question the existence of alpha- 
amylose in potato starch as it exists in cornstarch. They state that because 
the beta-amylose retrogrades on standing to a residue which resembles 
alpha-amylose except in its fatty-acid content, many investigators report 
the presence of alpha-amylose in potato starch. 

The fatty acids may be split from the carbohydrate by long acid hydrol- 
ysis or with lipase-free amylase. Taylor and associates report that un- 
saturated fatty acids are liberated before the saturated ones. 

Samec states that "careful researches concerning the colloidal changes 
which occur because of esterification of the starch substance with fatty 
acids are not as yet available, but we assume that the hydration capacity 
will thereby be decreased since longer chains of C-Ho are introduced into 
the molecule. The hydration capacity is also decreased by compounds con- 
taining phosphorus and nitrogen." 

Cereal starches contain a relatively higher percentage of fatty acids. 
Potato starch contains no fatty acids but has a relatively high phosphorus 
content. Wheat also has a relatively high phosphorus content. Taylor states 
that roughly, those starches having a relatively high fatty-acid content 
may have a relatively low phosphoric-acid content and vice versa. 

Starch paste. Starch granules added to cold water swell slightly. 
According to Alsberg the axes may increase as much as 15 per cent. Such 
swelling is not like that in hot water inasmuch as there is no change in 
structure observable under the polarizing microscope. If the starch is dried 
rifts may appear in the granule, and the dried starch granules are deprived 
of their power to reassume their former volume when wetted. When a 
small quantity of starch is mixed with cold water, a thin, milky, non- 



GELATINIZATION 407 

viscid suspension is formed. If left standing, the starch granules settle to 
the bottom of the container and the supernatant liquid appears clear. If the 
starch suspension is heated a change takes place. It becomes thick, forming 
a paste which is opaque or transparent. The viscosity of the warm paste 
is far greater than that of the water suspension, but on cooling it loses some 
of its fluidity, becoming less plastic and more viscid, firm, or stiff. Alsberg 
has suggested that the reason for the loss of plasticity of the cool paste 
is that it regains some of its former rigidity at lower temperatures and 
that the surface of the granules may be more sticky at the lower tempera- 
ture, thus preventing one granule from moving or flowing so easily past 
another. It has also been suggested that some of the starch is less soluble 
at the lower temperature. 

When cornstarch is heated with water the resulting paste is clear or 
transparent. When flour is used the paste is opaque. It is for this reason 
that a clearer color is obtained when cornstarch is used with colored fruit 
juices than when flour is used. Samec ascribes the opaque color with wheat 
starch pastes to the combination of the wheat starch with phosphorus and 
protein. In another reference he says, "Pastes from wheat starches are 
white, cloudy, and a little slimy. The starches of cereals do not contain 
as large quantities of phosphorus, but contain fatty acids. Pastes from starch 
of such starch are 'pasty' and not 'pectinous.' " Elsewhere it has been 
stated that combination of starch with phosphorus increases, whereas fatty 
acids decrease, the hydration capacity, which may have some effect on the 
translucency of the paste. 

Granule injury. If starch granules are injured or ruptured in milling or 
in their separation from other material, some soluble starch is found dis- 
persed in cold solutions; and with increasing proportions of soluble starch 
the unheated solution becomes more viscid, the heated solution correspond- 
ingly less stiff or viscous. Long grinding appears to break some of the starch 
chains into shorter units. 

Gelatinization. The change upon heating a cold water starch sus- 
pension, so that a transparent or opaque, plastic, viscid product that forms 
a gel results, is known as gelatinization. Gelatinization depends upon the 
starch's being heated to a definite temperature, but the temperature at 
which gelatinization starts depends upon ( 1 ) the length of time the granule 
is wet before it is heated, (2) the kind of starch, (3) the size of the 
granule, and (4) possibly the salts in the water or combined with the 
phosphoric acid of the starch. 

During gelatinization some starches tend to disperse, that is the physical 
units become smaller or the granule may disintegrate. With other starches 
most of the granule may remain intact but may assume a typical hydrated 
shape. Thus the photomicrographs of Woodruff and of Sjostrom indicate 
that wheat starch when hydrated tends to become kidney-shaped. 

Gelatinization occurs and extends over a wide range of temperature. 
Swelling may start and the paste becomes more viscid at a fairly low tem- 



408 FLOUR AND BREAD 

perature, but complete swelling and maximum stiffening ability may not 
occur until the starch is heated to a much higher temperature. 

Samec says that, if starch granules have been wet or soaked for some 
time before heating, gelatinization begins at a lower temperature. This 
gives at least a partial explanation for the shortened cooking period of 
soaked cereals. 

The kind of starch. Richardson, Higginbotham, and Farrow state that 
potato starch gelatinizes more readily than sago or cornstarch. They found 
that cornstarch gelatinizes slowly in water at temperatures up to 100°C. 
and in pastes prepared by heating for 30 minutes at this temperature the 
granules, although swollen, are far from completely dispersed in the solu- 
tion. The gel formed on cooling such a paste is quite distinct in type from 
that of potato, in which the granules are dispersed to a much greater ex- 
tent. A sago gel may be regarded as intermediate in type between those of 
potato and cornstarch. 

Alsberg and Rask report that wheat and maize starches change little 
until a temperature of 65 °C. is reached, when they begin to thicken 
slightly, thus increasing the viscosity. 

Woodruff and Nicoli heated 5-per cent starch suspensions by weight in 
a water bath at such a rate that 38 minutes were required for the paste 
to reach 90° and 22 minutes longer to reach 99.5 °C. They found the 
translucency increased quite suddenly at a temperature specific for each 
starch, this temperature not being sharp but covering a range of 1° to 2°. 
Heating a longer time to a higher temperature did not increase the trans- 
lucency. This temperature was as follows: Corn, 86-87°; wheat, 87-88°; 
rice, 84-85°; potato, 60-70°; arrowroot, 79-80°; and cassava, 74-75°C. 
It was necessary to heat each starch to 90° or higher for maximum 
gelatinization. 

The size of the starch granules. Alsberg states that Nageli found that 
larger granules of potato starch begin to gelatinize at 55°C., whereas the 
smallest granules do not begin to gelatinize until a temperature of 65 °C. 
is reached. Suggested reasons are that the walls of the larger granules may 
be thinner or that large granules in swelling necessarily develop greater 
internal pressures per unit of granule surface than small ones. 

The effect of large granules gelatinizing at lower temperatures and 
swelling more rapidly than small ones is indicated by Alsberg. Large 
granules in gelatinizing first swell and absorb more water which may affect 
the plasticity of the baking dough. *'If the average granule size is small, 
this effect would come later than if the average size is large." Other things 
being equal, the longer the dough remains plastic, presumably, the greater 
will be the volume of the baked loaf. The size of the starch granules might 
also apply to textures and volume obtained in cake. 

Effect of salts. In studying flocculation of starch pastes Samuel inves- 
tigated the effect of different metallic salts and found their action to be 
varied. Some lowered the gelatinization temperature considerably. 



VISCOSITY OF STARCH PASTES 409 

Viscosity of starch pastes. Viscosity of pastes made from the same 
concentration of starch vary (1) with different starches, (2) with its 
phosphoric acid content, (3) with the phosphorus salt content, (4) with 
the temperature to w^hich it is heated, (5) with the degree of injury or 
grinding of the granule, (6) possibly the proportion of beta- and alpha- 
amylose, and (7) with the length of the starch chain. Chain length may in 
turn be affected by application of dry heat, by boiling with water, or by 
acid and enzyme hydrolysis. 

Different starches. It has long been known in food preparation that 
starches from different sources need to be used in different concentrations, 
if the product to be served is stiffened to the same degree. 

Woodruff and Nicoli determined the stiffness of starch gels from 5 per 
cent concentrations of starch. The results, arranged in order of decreasing 
stiffness are : corn, wheat, rice, potato, arrowroot, and cassava. Other dif- 
ferences noted were: Of the three cereal starches, rice was the most 
translucent and tender when cut; corn was the firmest, the cold gel being 
chalky white; and wheat was intermediate between these two. For the 
other starches, the potato paste was ropy and too gummy to leave the mold 
well so that it gave a poorly formed gel, although quite transparent; 
arrowroot gave a still softer and more transparent gel ; and cassava starch 
gave only a viscous fluid. It was necessary to heat the gels to 90 °C. for 
maximum stiffening, but heating of any one starch to 90°, 95°, 99.5 °C. 
gave gels indistinguishable from each other. 

Phosphoric acid. Samec's results showing the increased viscosity of phos- 
phated starch have been given in the discussion of phosphoric-acid content 
of starch. From these results he concluded that the viscosity of starch pastes 
could be reduced in two ways : ( 1 ) by removing the phosphoric acid and 
(2) by reducing the size of the molecule. In general, paste formation 
increased with increased phosphoric acid content, but this did not hold for 
wheat starch. Samec believes this discrepancy may be explained on the 
basis that phosphoric acid in wheat starch may be present as a compound 
with the proteins. 

In general smaller granules gave richer or stiffer pastes than larger 
granules, which Samec ascribes to the relatively higher phosphorus content 
of the smaller granules. 

Phosphorus salt content. In separating starch by electrodialysis Samec 
states the amylophosphoric acid isolated in this way proved to be a diabasic 
acid. The solutions of various amylophosphoric acid salts not only gave 
pastes with differences in viscosity but also affected other properties. Thus 
copper and iron amylophosphate paste separated badly, the calcium amylo- 
phosphate tasted like chalk, magnesium and ammonium caused a slight 
burning and pricking sensation on the tongue, respectively, and sodium 
and potassium were reminiscent of wheat flour. 

Temperature to which the starch is heated. Although the starch may 
swell to a certain extent at lower temperatures, it may not reach its maxi- 



410 FLOUR AND BREAD 

mum stiffening power until a higher temperature is reached. Thus Alsberg 
and Rask found the maximum viscosity of wheat starch occurred at 95 °C. 
Woodruff and Webber have shown that a 5 per cent wheat starch paste 
must be heated to at least 90°C. before the resulting gels will form mold- 
able gels, such as would be served for puddings. Furthermore, rapid heating 
to this temperature gave a better-formed gel than did slow heating. But 
temperatures of 95 °C. or above gave the firmest gels obtained with this 
concentration. 

For cornstarch paste Alsberg and Rask found the maximum viscosity at 
91 °C., but Richardson, Higginbotham, and Farrow's results indicate that 
maximum swelling of some cornstarch pastes does not occur until a tem- 
perature of 100°C. is reached. 

Degree of grinding. Samec states: ''The capacity of a starch to form paste 
decreases with continued grinding of the starch and the grinding also 
peptizes the starch to such an extent that it can pass through ultra-filters." 
Alsberg found that in flour ground until the granule walls are broken a 
larger percentage of the starch is dispersed. A higher percentage of such 
flour is required to produce a paste of definite thickness. His explanation 
of this is that starch from the broken granules passes into solution and does 
not thicken as much, hence a greater quantity is needed to produce a paste, 
for there are fewer whole granules to swell and occupy the volume of the 
suspension and thus produce stiffening or thickening. During gelatinization 
starch may absorb about 30 times its w^eight in water. The smaller the 
number of granules broken or dispersed, the smaller the percentage of 
starch required to produce a paste of definite stiffness. 

The proportion of alpha- and beta-amylose. Samec says that paste forma- 
tion depends on having a proper balance between the tendency to associate 
and to hydrate. With potato starch, and starches from similar species, this 
relationship is attained by the presence of both amylo-amylose and erythro- 
amylose, and by esterfication of the polysaccharid with phosphoric acid. 

Length of the starch chain. Richardson, Higginbotham, and Farrow state 
that Staudinger has shown that for many types of long-chain polymers there 
is close correlation between the chain length and the viscosity of the solu- 
tion. This relation was found to hold with sago starches but with other 
starches the relation was not found, so that it was suggested that other 
factors, such as distribution of length, rate of gelatinization, and degree of 
hydration of the chain molecules are as important as chain length in deter- 
mining viscosity. Natural starches contain chains of varying lengths and it 
may be that the average chain length is greater for some species of starches 
than for others. However, it is known that dextrins have shorter chain 
lengths than starch, and they have little or no paste-forming properties. 

When starch is dextrinized by heat or broken into shorter chain lengths 
by hydrolysis, either by diastase, acid, or other means, the stiffening power 
is decreased. Thus more of browned flour is required for thickening gravies 
and sauces than of the unbrowned flour. 



RESULTS OF FINE OR OVER-GRINDING ON FLOUR 411 

Acid. When starch pastes are treated with acid, hydrolysis of the gluco- 
side linkages takes place and shortening of the molecular chain occurs. 
Richardson, Higginbotham, and Farrow suggest that the attack occurs at 
random along the starch chains, so that in any paste of acid-modified starch 
there is a wide distribution of chains of varying length. As hydrolysis pro- 
ceeds an increasing number of shorter chains is produced, the reducing 
power is increased, and the stiffening power decreased. Hydrolysis with 
acid is more rapid as the temperature increases, which gives an explanation 
for adding lemon juice to the partially cooled gel of water, cornstarch, 
sugar, and egg yolk. Hydrolysis is also speeded by increasing the concen- 
tration of the acid. 

Boiling and enzyme hydrolysis. Hydrolysis is also brought about by 
diastatic enzymes and by boiling with water, the last more rapidly under 
pressure at temperatures above boiling. 

Commercial soluble starch. The commercial soluble starches should not 
be confused with soluble starch occurring naturally in food products. 
Commercial soluble starches have been treated, usually with acid, and 
although they are more soluble, their properties, such as stiffening power, 
are also modified. 

The effect of acid upon the thickening power of starch has been known 
for a long time. If cornstarch, lemon juice, and water are boiled together, 
the resulting paste is not as thick as one made with the same amount of 
cornstarch and liquid, but without the acid. 

Sugar and starch. Woodruff and Nicoli have reported that pastes made 
from 5 grams of corn, wheat, rice, potato, arrowroot, or cassava starch 
and 95 grams of water required heating to 90°C. or higher before the 
cooled gels were strong enough to retain the shape of a mold. When 
10, 30, 50 or 60 grams of sucrose were added to the above quantities the 
three root starches formed increasingly softer gels with increasing amount 
of sugar, the 50 and 60 grams giving a sirup. Although the three cereal 
starches showed increasing transparency and tenderness with increase of 
sugar, a gel that would not mold was not obtained until more than 50 
grams of sucrose were added. A sirup was obtained with 60 grams of sugar 
and the cereal starches. 

The Results of Fine or Over-Grinding upon Flour 

Bakers have known for a long time that flour ground too finely does 
not produce so good a quality of bread as flour that has not been over- 
ground. Alsberg and Griffing have reported the following for over-ground 
flour. Before over-grinding, the starch granules clumped together under 
the microscope; in the over-ground flour they were scattered. Over-grind- 
ing injured the starch, and as previously stated the greater the degree of 
injury the more the starch was dispersed. Diastase acted on the whole 
granule rather slowly, but with many injured granules and the increase in 



412 



FLOUR AND BREAD 



cold water extract the action of diastatic enzymes in converting starch to 
maltose was more rapid ; as a result, the rate of fermentation in bread mak- 
ing was increased. Alsberg has suggested adding some over-ground flour 
to flour reported low in diastase. Since the injured granules swell in cold 
water they absorb a larger proportion of water. Alsberg states that in the 
very severely over-ground flours the swelling may resemble heat gelatiniza- 
tion. Thus in severe over-grinding the baking quality is reduced although 
the hydration capacity of the flour is increased. Usually increased hydra- 
tion capacity means increased baking quality. Moderate over-grinding 
did not affect the gluten but evidence was found that severe over-grinding 
injured the gluten. 



Effect o£ Aging on Flour 

It is commonly accepted that aging, particularly during the first 4 or 5 
weeks, improves the quality of flour for making bread. Dunlap has reported 
that he has always obtained better results with aged than with fresh flour. 
Some of his results are given in Table 46.

Sherwood and Bailey report that loaf volume, color, and absorption 
improve during the first few months of aging, but the loaf volume may 
diminish after extended storage, even though the color and hydration 
capacity continue to improve. They found that proteolytic activity grad- 
ually decreased in storage, sprouted wheat flours retaining their activity 
in storage for a few years. The improvement in baking quality with aging 
has been ascribed to the increasing acidity, the increase in free fatty acids, 
and the diminution of proteolytic activity. 

Acidity. The acidity of flour increases in storage, the pH of aged 
being lower than that of freshly milled flour. However, Bailey believes 
that the increased acidity is not the only factor responsible for improve- 



EFFECT OF SALTS ON PROTEIN EXTRACTED 413 

ment in baking strength, for, if this were the case, the baking quality could 
be improved by the addition of acids to doughs from fresh flours. 

Free fatty acids. Kozmin attributes the improvement w^ith aging to 
the development of free fatty acids. The removal of free fatty acids 
rejuvenated the flour, its bread-baking properties returning to their original 
state. In turn, the addition of free unsaturated fatty acids produces the 
same effect as natural aging. Unsaturated fatty acids had more effect than 
saturated ones. Aging or the development of free fatty acids occurred more 
rapidly as the storage temperature increased. 

Sullivan, Near, and Foley state that their results agree vrell vs^ith those 
of Kozmin, w^ith the exception that American flours do not show^ the im- 
provement w^hich European flours do w^ith the presence of free, unsaturated 
fatty acids. It vras found, however, that after oxidation of the unsaturated 
acids had occurred that the baking quality was seriously damaged. 

Proteolytic enzymes. Balls and Hale state that the changes that 
take place in the quality and behavior of flours after bleaching or storage 
in air are due to the diminution of proteolytic activity. 

The Proteins of Flour 

Osborne in his classical work on the wheat flour proteins reported only 
a small fraction soluble in water. This fraction contained leucosin and 
albumin, plus proteose or non-protein nitrogen. A small fraction was ex- 
tracted by dilute salt solution and this globulin fraction constituted about 
0.6 per cent of the wheat kernel. Gliadin, a prolamin, constituting about 
40 per cent of the total protein, was soluble in alcohol. The remaining 
protein, called glutenin, was found to be insoluble except in dilute acids 
or alkalies. 

But later work has shown that the terms "globulin" and "albumin" have 
little meaning in connection with flour proteins and that neither "gliadin" 
nor "glutenin" may be an individual chemical entity. Blish in "The Wheat 
Flour Proteins" says, "It seems that as we have become increasingly 
familiar with the behavior and properties of flour proteins, we have found 
ourselves progressively more and more hesitant in the matter of making 
dogmatic assertions and published statements relative to their nature, their 
identities, and their individualities." 

Effect of salts on protein extracted. Gortner, Hoffman, and Sin- 
clair found that N/1 solutions extract the following average percentages 
of the total wheat flour proteins: KF 13, KCl 23, KBr 37, and KI 64. 
They showed that the amount of protein extracted varied not only with 
the nature of the salt used but also with its concentration. 

Gortner, Hoffman, and Sinclair have found that for increasing peptizing 
effect on wheat proteins the following anions arrange themselves in a 
lyotropic series: F < SO4 < CI < tartrate < Br < I. The cations have a 



414 FLOUR AND BREAD 

less distinct effect on solubility of the flour proteins but give the following 
order of peptization: Na < K < Li < Sr < Mg < Ca. 

Mangels and Bailey in studying the gelatinizing action of reagents on 
starch noted a Hoffmeister series as follows: CI < B < I < CNS < salicyl- 
ate <OH. 

Rich has shown that the amount of protein extracted or peptized by 
N/2 MgS04, 10 per cent NaCl, and N/4 NaCl solutions varies directly 
with increasing ash content of the flour. In general, the maximum peptiza- 
tion occurred with N/4 solutions. A further increase in salt concentration 
causes dehydration and eventually salting out of the protein micelle. 

Is gluten a single protein? McCalla and Rose say that the most 
soluble 10 to 15 per cent of the gluten protein is probably distinct, but the 
remainder is a single protein complex which can be divided into a great 
many progressively different fractions. They suggest the terms ''glutenin" 
and ''gliadin" should be discarded. 

Rich states that it is "apparent that the protein of wheat is a single 
individual and that knowledge of the nature of differences in protein 
'quality' between 'strong' and 'weak' flours can best be solved by studying 
the protein as a whole instead of splitting it into arbitrary fractions and 
studying each fraction separately." He believes that if the dispersing agent 
or the method of isolation is changed, even slightly, there is no established 
limit as to the number, quantities, and character of the protein fraction 
that can be isolated. 

Is gluten composed of distinct groups or individual proteins? 
The greatest difficulty in fractional precipitation of the flour proteins can 
be traced to the agents used to disperse them, for no solvent has been found 
from which all the protein can be recovered without loss or irreversible 
change in original properties. Blish says that "irreversible and destructive 
hydrolytic changes occur almost at once, and proceed at a relatively high 
rate when gluten is dispersed in weak alkali." On the other hand, in dilute 
acetic acid, an appreciable amount of hydrolysis is detectable after a few 
hours standing, but at ice temperature hydrolytic changes are slow. Addi- 
tion of an equal volume of alcohol to dilute acetic acid protects against 
hydrolytic change, but may split off other components. Urea is used for 
peptizing proteins, but because it gelatinizes starch must be used on washed 
gluten. 

Salicylate is one of the anions in the lyotropic or Hoffmeister series caus- 
ing greatest peptization of flour proteins. Sodim salicylate appears to peptize 
the flour proteins with no observable hydrolysis or denaturation. 

Blish states that it is probable that only a few components or component 
groups constitute the flour proteins and that they may be precipitated as 
mixtures containing progressively varying proportions of these few com- 
ponents. "We can merely summarize our present viewpoint, which is as 
follows: There is a considerable portion of flour protein that does not enter 
into the formation of gluten, but it is not yet possible to distinguish a sharp 



GLUTEN 415 

and definite boundary-line between the gluten and non-gluten portions. 
With reference to gluten, itself, we recognize a definite fraction consisting 
of approximately 10-12 per cent that is extremely resistant to dispersion. 
We recognize the 'gliadin' fraction, which accounts for 50 per cent or 
more of the gluten, and which may or may not be a mixture of components 
having very similar properties. The remaining portion we regard as doubt- 
ful, but until proven otherwise we prefer to look upon it as a mixture of a 
'glutenin' and a lipoid-protein complex." Work with flour proteins **is 
peculiarly a problem in which any new discovery is likely to invalidate 
much that has gone before and to necessitate an entire re-examination of the 
whole situation." 

Lecithio-protein. Flour may contain a lecithio-protein somewhat sim- 
ilar to that found in egg yolk. Blish says that alcohol added to acetic acid 
solutions in fractioning flour proteins may cause irreversible splitting off 
of an important gluten component, a "lecithio-protein" or some similar 
lipoid-protein complex. Blish adds that he suspects the ''lecithio-protein" 
is a very important gluten constituent and that its importance and amount 
in flours have been underestimated. "At present we feel that a thorough 
study and understanding of the nature and properties of the lipoid-protein 
complex will contribute greatly to the solution of several flour problems 
that are of the greatest fundamental interest and importance." 

Gliadin. Gliadin, either as a multiple protein, or as a component of 
the gluten complex, is soluble in 60 to 70 per cent alcohol. In water it swells 
to a sticky mass, being least soluble at its isoelectric point about pH 6.5. 
With increasing acidity it becomes more soluble, reaching a maximum with 
a pH range of 2.0 to 3.0. With hydrogen-ion concentration greater than 
pH 2 the solubility decreases gradually. With increasing alkalinity, the 
solubility of gliadin increases more rapidly than on the acid side, up to pH. 
13.1, the most alkaline of the solutions used by Tague. 

Glutenin. It is the glutenin, classified as a glutelin, that gives the 
desirable baking qualities to wheat flour, qualities not possessed by any 
other cereal. Glutenin is insoluble in water, but is increasingly soluble in 
dilute acids and alkalies. Sharp and Gortner state that the maximum 
solubility occurs on the acid side at /»H 3.0 and on the alkaline side at />H 
11. The isoelectric range, as determined by Sharp and Gortner, is from 
pH 6.0 to 8.0, and by Bungenberg de Jong as pH 5.6. Glutenin swells 
in water. If prepared with sodium salicylate it is said to resemble gluten 
in its coherence and tenacity. 

Gluten 

The characteristics of gluten gain in importance because it is the protein 
of the flour as a whole, regardless of whether it is composed of one, few, or 
many components, that gives the baking quality to flour. When water is 



416 FLOUR AND BREAD 

added to flour, the proteins gradually absorb about 200 per cent of their 
weight in water. 

When flour is made into a stiff dough and kneaded for a short time, 
the starch can be washed out, leaving a small part of the original dough 
which is known as gluten. Gluten is rubbery, tenacious, and elastic. It 
is usually a light gray or slightly yellowish color. A large part of the gluten 
is composed of the proteins gliadin and glutenin. In addition to the protein, 
the gluten as washed from the dough contains some starch which is 
entangled in the gluten, some lipoids, mineral salts, and water. The amount 
of all these constituents of gluten varies with the manipulation in wash- 
ing, the kind of water used, and the character of the flour itself. The 
physico-chemical properties of gluten have been extensively studied and 
applications made to baking bread. 

Since gliadin and glutenin have about the same isoelectric point, rang- 
ing around />H 6.5 to 7.0, Bailey states, *'it might be anticipated that 
maximum coherence and extensibility of gluten and dough should be 
encountered in about the same range." 

Heat coagulation of gluten. Gluten seems to have no definite coagu- 
lation temperature. Alsberg and Griffing have reported that heating the 
gluten decreases its power to swell in acid solutions, the swelling power 
decreasing during heating from 50° to 80°C. Except at the temperatures 
60° to 65°C. no information was obtained that indicated a definite coagu- 
lation temperature. They state that denaturation takes place over the 
whole range from 50° to 80°C. The swelling power was not impaired 
but probably increased at temperatures from 30° to 50 °C. 

Gluten quality. Different flours vary in their baking qualities. Millers 
and bakers speak of those having poor baking qualities as "weak" flours, 
and those having good baking qualities as "strong" flours. The definition 
of good baking quality commonly accepted by millers and bakers is the one 
suggested by an English worker, Humphries: "Strong flour is one capable 
of making large well-piled loaves." This definition excludes flours "that 
produce large loaves, but do not rise satisfactorily." Thus strong flours 
and good baking quality are synonymous to a certain extent. A weak flour 
does not have good baking qualities, but there is no distinct line between 
weak and strong flours. A flour may also be too strong for good baking 
qualities. Such a flour is called gluten "bound." 

Gortner and Sharp have reported that weakness of flour may be divided 
into three classes as follows : 

1. Weakness due to an adequate quantity of gluten but of inferior 
quality. 

2. Weakness due to an inadequate quantity of gluten of good quality. 

3. Weakness due to factors influencing yeast activity, diastatic and 
proteolytic enzymes, hydrogen-ion concentration, etc. 

Even though flour may have an adequate quantity of gluten for good 



GLUTEN AND DOUGH 417 

baking qualities, if the quality is inferior it does not produce a good loaf 
of bread. 

Gluten quality and growth of wheat. In the flour the protein may 
be thought of as a partially dried hydrogel. When proteins are dried to 
contain little or no water, less than 5 per cent, they may lose the power 
of swelling in water. If they contain 10 to 15 per cent of moisture they 
may retain the power of swelling in water. Flour contains 10 to 13 per 
cent of moisture, so that the swelling property is not destroyed. However, 
the moisture content of flours varies somewhat; but of more importance 
to the quality of the protein is the rate of dehydration of the protein when 
it is deposited in the wheat kernel. It is well recognized in colloidal chem- 
istry that the past history of a colloid influences its future reactions. The 
conditions during the growth of the wheat influence the later reactions 
of the protein. In the sap of the wheat the protein is in the form of a sol ; 
later as it is deposited in the wheat it is found in the form of a gel. With 
ripening and further dehydration of the protein, dried hydrogel is formed. 
The speed at which this takes place, depending upon climatic and moisture 
conditions, affects the quality of th« protein. The mineral salts and the 
lipoid content of the flour also influence the quality of the gluten, which has 
been discussed under ash. 

Gluten quality and colloidal state. Gortner and Doherty suggest 
that the size of the gluten particle is a factor in determining its properties. 
They emphasize that strong flours give glutens with nearly "perfect col- 
loidal" gels with highly "pronounced physico-chemical properties," whereas 
weak flours give glutens whose properties are less colloidal; or strong 
flours contain gluten in a less dispersed state, and weak ones contain gluten 
more highly dispersed. 

Gluten and Dough 

Bungenberg de Jong states that gliadin is a protein that swells easily in 
water, is readily peptized to a colloidal solution by dilute alkali or acid and 
in water forms a sticky mass that can easily be stretched into threads. 
Glutenin in water is a flaky mass without much coherence which swells in, 
but is diflficult to peptize in dilute acid. It peptizes easily in alkali. 

Bungenberg de Jong suggests that the plastic and elastic properties of 
gluten are partially due to the two proteins' adhering to each other because 
of opposite charges throughout a definite pH range. If this is true, he says 
that at the pH at which the charge on each protein is the same either a 
maximum or minimum in physical properties should occur, i.e., turbidity, 
coherence, farinogram curves (which is a measure of consistency of the 
dough). The point at which this maximum occurs might be altered by the 
presence of other proteins, such as albumin and globulin with isoelectric 



418 



FLOUR AND BREAD 



points much lower than that of glutenin, hence would be negatively 
charged at the pH range at which the gliadin-gluten complex occurs. He 
also discusses the possibility of salts altering the maximum point. Jong 
represents this maximum or minimum range schematically. See Fig. 44. 

Gliadin, below its isoelectric point pH 6.4, is positively charged, this 
charge increasing as the pH is lowered. However, about pH 5.6, the 
isoelectric point of glutenin, the glutenin is negatively charged. In Bungen- 
berg de Jong's experiments maximum turbidity occurred at pH 6.1. 

Gluten quality and proteolytic enzymes. Balls and Hale ascribe 
part of the quality of gluten to the action of the proteolytic enzymes. They 
state that the proteolytic enzymes change the colloidal character of wheat 
proteins, the effects of which are shown in the gluten. "Proteinases usually 




Fig. 44. — Bungenberg de Jong's representation of effect of charge on gliadin 
and glutenin on gluten properties. The charge of components is represented by posi- 
tive and negative signs. J. Soc. Chem. Ind. 52: 391T, 1933. 



produce first a coagulation of the protein ; later the coagulated material Is 
broken down and perhaps ultimately dissolved. If this rule holds for flour, 
in the first phase of proteinase action the gluten would probably become more 
tenacious; in the second phase it would be broken down to a thinner, more 
nearly liquid material." They add that a small amount of proteinase may be 
beneficial, a larger amount harmful. "Usually there is too much, rather 
than too little." 

The baking qualities of gluten are determined largely by Its hydration 
capacity, its power of cohesion, and its elasticity. The hydration capacity 
results in a larger or smaller volume when mixed with water. With a 
larger volume the particles of the gluten form a greater surface for con- 
tact with each other, thus increasing the sponge-like character of the 
dough. Also with increased swelling the gluten becomes more tender 
and less tenacious ; with less swelling the volume is smaller but the tenacity 
may be greater. The swelling can be so great that there is a limit to the 



HYDRATION CAPACITY 419 

amount of stretching the gluten will stand before breaking. The cohesive- 
ness of the gluten gives less chance for the gluten particles to be pulled 
apart ; the elasticity permits stretching under pressure or when pulled. 

Hydration capacity. By hydration capacity is meant the swelling of 
the gluten in water, whatever the mechanism by which it is brought about, 
whether by absorption or other means. Gortner and Doherty have reported 
that a strong gluten has a faster rate of hydration, or imbibition as they 
express it, and also a higher maximum hydration capacity than a weak 
gluten. 

Distribution of water in dough. Alsberg in "Starch and Flour Quality" 
states that in bread dough about 50 per cent of the water is bound moisture 
or water of hydration incapable of serving as a solvent for other substances. 
The starch holds approximately half of this bound water, the gluten the 
remainder. Starch at room temperature can absorb about 30 per cent of its 
weight of water, whereas gluten may absorb 200 per cent of its weight. But 
starch constitutes so great a percentage of the flour that as a result the 
quantity of water it binds is nearly as great as that bound by gluten. The 
remaining 50 per cent of the water in bread dough, which may serve as a 
solvent for other substances and form steam, cannot be separated readily 
from the dough by mechanical means. It is held in the interstices of the 
dough by surface and mechanical forces. 

The proportion of water added. The proportion of water added also 
affects the character of the dough and baked product. If too little water is 
added the maximum cohesiveness and elasticity of the gluten is not at- 
tained. 

Water-binding capacity of flour, dough, and bread. Kuhlmann and 
Golossowa found that the water-binding capacity of the flours they tested 
was in the following order : Soya, rye, corn maize, durum wheat, soft wheat, 
and potato. No complete parallelism existed between the protein content of 
the flours and their water-binding capacity. Rye starch had a water-binding 
capacity of 78 to 80 per cent, whereas that of wheat starch was 40 to 42 
per cent. A direct relationship was found between the water-absorbing 
capacity of the flour and its water-binding capacity. 

The water-binding capacity of bread doughs was about the same as flour, 
but a sharp increase occurred in bound water during baking so that a dough 
with a water-binding capacity of 60 per cent changed to about 85 per cent 
in hot bread. 

Kuhlmann and Golossowa found that the factors which increased the 
water-binding capacity of the dough decreased moisture loss in baking and 
in drying out or aging of the bread after baking. Both the method of making 
the dough and materials used influenced the water-binding capacity. Doughs 
made by a straight-dough method bound more water than those made by 
the sponge method. When the flour for the sponge method was scalded, the 



420 FLOUR AND BREAD 

water-binding capacity was markedly increased over dough or bread made 
by the sponge method without scalding and slightly higher than dough made 
by the straight-dough method. The addition of maltose and buttermilk 
increased the water-binding capacity of the doughs and bread. 

The hydration of a gluten and hence its tenacity or cohesiveness, and 
its elasticity or extensibility, may be altered, that is increased or decreased, 
by: (1) over-grinding, (2) bringing the dough to a certain acidity or 
alkalinity and subsequent neutralization, (3) treating with alcohol, (4) 
salts, (5) alkalies, (6) acids, (7) proportion of water used, (8) added 
substances, (9) temperature, (10) time of standing, (11) mechanical 
treatment of the dough, and (12) fermentation. 

Over-grinding has been considered. The effect of mechanical treatment 
of the dough and fermentation upon gluten will be considered with the 
discussion of bread making. The effect of proportion of water used has 
been considered and that of added substances will be considered under 
dough structure. 

Bringiriff the dough to a certain acidity or alkalinity and subsequent 
neutralization. The quality of the gluten can be altered by increasing the 
acidity or alkalinity. Gortner and Johnson have found that "doughs 
brought to /)H 3.0 or 11.0 by the addition of acid or alkali and in which 
the acid or alkali has been subsequently neutralized, have lost their bak- 
ing strength." 

Treating with alcohol. Gortner and Johnson have found that flour 
treated with 70 to 85 per cent alcohol, from which the alcohol is evapo- 
rated, and the flour dried and remilled, when used in bread has lost its bak- 
ing quality. They attribute this to a loss in colloidal properties brought 
about by action of alcohol on the glutenin of the flour. 

Salts. The imbibition of water by gluten, and thus the swelling, may 
be depressed considerably by salts. This may be brought about by the salts 
found in the flour, by the addition of salts like baking powders to flour 
mixtures, or by the addition of the so-called flour improvers to weak flours. 
The inhibiting effect may be due to the cation or the anion of the salt. 
Different salts depress the hydration capacity of the gluten in different 
proportions, that is, in the order of a lyotropic series. See also the section 
on proteins. 

Bailey and Le Vesconte have reported that the addition of monocalcium 
phosphate to a dough effected a slight increase in the extensibility of 
gluten. They find no increase in extensibility of the dough, as measured 
in the Chopin extensimeter, when calcium sulfate and magnesium sulfate 
are added in the proportions used in commercial practise. 

Alkalies. The hydration capacity of gluten on the alkaline side of the 
isoelectric point reaches its maximum capacity at a pYL 11.0. Beyond a /)H 
11.0 the gluten dissolves very rapidly with increasing alkalinity. Since 
gluten proteins tend to imbibe water and disperse in a weakly alkaline 



HYDRATION CAPACITY 421 

medium, doughs with a slight alkaline reaction are sticky. With excess 
alkali they become yellow and develop a soapy taste. Since the proteins are 
peptized readily with alkali, a product with a pH higher than 7 is quite 
tender. Thus chocolate cakes and gingerbread with excess alkali (soda) are 
very tender, though the cell walls are very thick. 

Acids. Acids as well as salts and alkalies markedly influence the hydra- 
tion capacity of gluten. The hydration capacity of gluten is increased with 
increased hydrogen-ion concentration until a pH of 3.0 is reached. With a 
pH lower than 3.0 the hydration capacity is decreased. Gortner and 
Sharp have shown that the various acids produce a maximum hydration 
at pH 3.0. On the acid side of the isoelectric point the gluten is not 
dispersed as rapidly as on the alkaline side, so that doughs with an acid 
reaction are more tenacious, and not so sticky as ones with an alkaline 
reaction. During fermentation of bread the development of acids gives an 
acid reaction to the dough, increases the hydration and solubility of the 
proteins and thus the tenderness of the resulting bread. 

Time of standing. Bailey and Le Vesconte have reported that time of 
standing of the dough after mixing influences the extensibility of the 
dough. The greater part of this increase in elasticity or ease of handling 
is quite noticeable in many dough products. Pastry and other products 
are easier to handle if allowed to stand a short time after mixing, before 
they are rolled or baked. 

Temperature. Bailey and Le Vesconte have reported that temperature 
markedly influences the extensibility of a flour and water dough. With 
increasing temperature the dough becomes more elastic and less tenacious. 
Kent-Jones in reporting the experiments of Luers* comments on the influ- 
ence of temperature on hydration capacity. At a temperature of 8° to 9°C. 
the imbibition of water by gliadin was quite low and he speaks of it as 
almost **an anti-swelling effect." At higher temperatures the gluten becomes 
more elastic. This is of great importance in baking, for without this quality 
the cell walls of the dough would break and coalesce before the tempera- 
ture was reached at which the protein is coagulated. As a result the volume 
of the product would either not increase or would be lessened during 
baking. 

With higher temperatures of mixing the gluten swells more rapidly and 
this affects the rapidity with which it develops or becomes attenuated 
with mixing. 

Swanson in his article, ''The Theory of Colloidal Behavior in Dough," 
gives a good description of dough structure. The following account is 
based upon his article, upon other reading, and upon observation. 

Bread dough has two continuous phases: water constitutes one, and 
gluten the other. 

* Luers, H., Koll. Zeitschrift, 25 : Nov., 1919. 



422 FLOUR AND BREAD 

Starch in dough. When flour is mixed with water to form a dough 
the starch granules retain their shape. They also have a certain rigidity and 
little adhesive power, so that they are not easily pulled or squeezed out of 
shape and do not adhere to each other. 

Gluten particles in dough. In contrast to the starch particles in 
dough, the gluten particles behave as if their shape is very irregular. In the 
flour the shape may be regular, but it is the shape in the dough that gives 
the dough part of its distinctive baking properties. On account of this 
irregular shape the particles have a very large surface area. When swollen 
with water they can be easily pulled, squeezed, or packed into different 
shapes. 

The protein particles in the flour may be compared to chewing gum, for 
many of the properties are similar. Anyone who has chewed gum is 
familiar with its manipulation, so that it makes an excellent illustration. 
The size of the piece of gum is very much larger than that of the protein 
particle. The stick of chewing gum w^hen first placed in the mouth may 
be brittle and crumbly. As it becomes moist it sticks together and develops 
tenacity, adhesiveness, and cohesiveness. If two sticks of gum that have 
been chewed are brought in contact with each other they adhere or stick 
together; if pulled, they stretch. In the literature on dough, this change 
in shape through hydration, surface contact, and particles adhering to 
each other is called attenuation. The more the pieces of gum are pulled 
the more attenuated they become, but if the elastic strands touch each 
other in large areas they adhere, and when worked more and more, they 
become matted together in one piece. 

When the protein particles in the dough become moist they sw^ell and 
form gluten. The behavior of the protein particles when moistened is 
similar to that of the gum. When first moistened they are crumbly and do 
not adhere together. After the particles become hydrated they become sticky 
and tenacious. When the dough is stirred the surfaces of the particles come 
in contact and adhere to each other. The stirring of the dough stretches 
and pulls the surface contacts so that the gluten becomes attenuated and 
filaments formed. Attentuation of the gluten is often referred to as develop- 
ing the gluten or dough. 

Gluten forms a continuous phase in dough. The protein in the 
dough forms a continuous network or mesh structure throughout the 
dough. In this meshwork are the starch granules, the sugar, salts, and 
water. 

The protein particles compose only a portion of the flour content, 
although after they are hydrated the relative volume that they occupy in 
the dough is greater than their volume in the flour. If to the chewing gum 
we add some small round particles that do not change their shape and 
are about the size of small tapioca a better picture of dough structure 



STARCH 423 

is obtained. The small round particles will prevent the chewing gum from 
forming one solid mass and will tend to keep the pieces of gum apart, so 
that manipulation and sliding over the round particles is required to bring 
different surfaces of the gum in contact with each other. In the dough the 
whole starch granules do not swell appreciably until a temperature of 
60° to 65 °C. is reached. Thus in a dough mixed at ordinary temperatures 
they do not change their volume or shape. 

A good quality of gluten adheres strongly to other particles of gluten 
and forms many strands of network around the starch granules. A good 
quality of gluten must be elastic enough to stretch around the starch 
granules, and in addition stretch and retain gas bubbles formed in the 
dough that make the structure porous. No dough will retain all the gas 
formed within it, but a gluten of good quality will retain a very large 
portion of the gas bubbles. A poor quality of gluten will not stretch when 
the gas is formed but will break in places, and too large a proportion of 
the gas formed is lost. 

There are many different qualities of gluten in different wheats. Some 
may be very soft and not very tenacious; some may be like the ones 
described above; and others may be so strong that they are tenacious 
enough not to stretch without excess pressure. Such glutens are improved 
by blending with weaker glutens. Flour from the large mills is blended to 
produce a working quality of gluten that gives similar results when baked 
in different batches. Strong glutens may be improved by the addition of 
malt extract, which contains a larger proportion of the proteolytic enzyme 
proteinase than is found in the flour. Since part of the protein is hydrolyzed 
by the proteinase there is not such a compact mass left and the remaining 
gluten is softer and more elastic. 

Effect of Added Substances on Gluten of Dough 

Egg. In thin batters, to improve the baking quality or to give structure 
to the finished product, eggs are added. Without their addition only a 
thickened mass with no increased volume is obtained. The egg protein 
coagulates when heated and with the gluten retains the gas formed in 
the batter. 

Fat. The addition of fat gives a shorter dough or a more tender one. 
By short, bakers refer to the gluten breaking quickly and not adhering 
tenaciously. Fat causes the gluten threads to pull or break apart more 
easily. In other words, it might be stated that when the gluten particles 
are "greased" or lubricated they adhere less strongly. 

Starch. Bailey and Le Vesconte have found that the addition of starch 
to a bread flour results in a decreased extensibility. The addition of 10 per 
cent of starch decreases the extensibility only a little, but the addition of 



424 FLOUR AND BREAD 

larger quantities decreases it to a greater extent. The gas-retaining capacity 
of the dough and the quality of the bread are also impaired. However, 
since the added starch is not embedded in gluten and the diastase can act on 
such starch quickly, Alsberg states that carbon dioxide will be formed more 
rapidly, with which statement Johnson and Bailey agreed. 

Cooked mashed potatoes are sometimes added to bread doughs. Since 
the starch is cooked, judging from Kuhlmann and Golossowa's results, the 
water-binding capacity of the dough and bread should be increased; but 
too large a quantity of mashed potatoes because of the dilution of the gluten 
may impair the quality of the bread. 

Sugar. Jago reports that sugar causes a diminution of the amount of 
gluten that can be washed from a dough. When the sugar was added to 
the dough and the gluten extracted with alcohol much more gluten was 
dissolved, from which he concluded that sugar has a solvent action on gluten. 

Baking powder. Baking powder is added to dough as a leavening agent, 
that is, to produce carbon dioxide gas to stretch the gluten and produce 
a porous texture. The ingredients of the baking powder and the residue 
of the salts formed from the reaction of the baking powder may have either 
an inhibiting or accelerating effect upon the hydration capacity of the gluten, 
depending upon the particular cations and anions of the baking powders 
or their salts. 

Bread 

Bread is made of flour, water, salt, fat, and sugar. To these ingredients 
the yeast plant is added. The right treatment of the whole mass gives 
a loaf of bread of good volume containing cells of definite structure and 
size. 

Bread is a very complex substance. In addition to organic and inorganic 
materials it contains three substances that show colloidal behavior: the 
protein, the starch, and the cellulose. The amount of cellulose is quite 
small, so that it probably plays a very minor role in bread making. The 
part that different constituents of the flour play in the dough structure 
has been discussed in the preceding pages. Their part in bread making 
will not be repeated here, but the proportion of ingredients used, the 
temperature for handling the dough and for baking, the fermentation, and 
the importance of manipulation of the dough will be considered. 

Chemical and physical tests may be performed on flour and dough, but 
as yet the only final convincing proof of flour quality for making bread 
is the baking test. 

Temperature. Enzyme activity is very slow at low temperatures and 
the enzymes are destroyed at high temperatures. Thus for optimum enzyme 
activity and also for yeast growth in bread dough it is important to keep 
the dough at definite temperatures. 



PROPORTION OF INGREDIENTS USED IN BREAD 425 

Fermentation is carried out over a wide range of temperature. The 
evidence indicates that a low temperature is more desirable from the stand- 
point of flavor and the development of acetylmethylcarbinol. But fermenta- 
tion is more rapid at higher temperatures. Temperatures from 26° to 
32°C. (79° to 90°F.) are used. There is more danger at higher tempera- 
tures for growth of undesirable organisms which produce disagreeable 
flavors. 

Proportion of ingredients used in bread. The American Asso- 
ciation of Cereal Chemists (A.A.C.C.) appointed a committee, headed 
by Fitz, later by Blish and others, to find the proportion of ingredients 
used by members of the association in test bakes, and to formulate a stand- 
ard method of procedure and a definite formula for use by members of 
the association. 

Flour. It is customary in computing the percentage of ingredients used 
in bread to take flour as 100 and compute the proportion of the other 
ingredients in relation to it. Thus if 112 grams of flour are used and to 
this is added 65 per cent of water, 72.8 grams of water would be used. 
It requires about % pound of flour to produce a pound loaf of bread, though 
the exact amount depends largely upon the hydration capacity of the gluten. 

Yeast. Two types of commercial yeast may be purchased, the com- 
pressed and the dry. A cake of compressed yeast contains many yeast plants 
in an active state. When it is used the yeast plants multiply rapidly, pro- 
ducing a large quantity of carbon dioxide gas, and the fermentation takes 
place in a short time. 

In dry yeast the yeast is mixed with corn meal and dried. The yeast 
plants are not active, as they are in a dormant state and they are few in 
number. The yeast needs to be soaked for a short time in warm water and 
then made into a sponge to give time for the revival and growth of the 
yeast plants. Therefore it requires a longer fermentation period than com- 
pressed yeast. 

In addition to the dry and the compressed yeast, two other types of yeast 
are used by housewives, chiefly farm women, where yeast cakes or bread 
cannot be delivered every day. A liquid yeast may be used and also a starter. 
The starter is a portion of the sponge that is saved to start the fermentation 
of the next baking of bread. Since the sponge or dough contains numerous 
yeast plants it is used instead of yeast cakes for the adding of yeast plants 
to the dough. To this starter sugar is added for food for the growth of 
the yeast during storage. 

After yeast is added to the bread a period of time elapses before the 
bread is baked. This period, the length of which depends upon the propor- 
tion of ingredients and the kind of yeast used, is called the fermentation 
period. Bakers call it ''proofing" and housewives "rising." 

Amount of yeast. The amount of yeast used in bread may vary in wide 
proportions. Fitz found that as a general rule bakers use 2 to 3 per cent of 



426 



FLOUR AND BREAD 



yeast, although the amount varies from 1 to 5.88 per cent. For home or 
school the amount may be increased according to the length of time allowed 
for the fermentation period. 

The following table taken from the pamphlet ''Baking Better Bread" 
by the Washburn Crosby Company gives the amount of yeast to use for 
different periods of fermentation for straight-dough process.

Water. Milk may be substituted for water in bread. It is usually scalded 
to destroy any bacteria or organisms that may produce undesirable flavors 
or be detrimental to yeast action. Since milk contains about 12 to 14 per 
cent solids, a larger proportion of it is added than of water. Water in 
which potatoes have been cooked is sometimes used for a part of the liquid 
in bread. Because of the development of rope in hot weather, it is often 
desirable in home-made bread to add the whey of sour milk during the 
summer. 

The best proportion of water varies with the hydration capacity of the 
gluten in the particular flour that is being used. The proportion as reported 
in the literature varies from about 51 to 67 per cent. Good bread flours 
usually require from 60 to 65 per cent of water. Soft-wheat flours, w^hich 
have weaker glutens, require a lower proportion of water. 

Effect of proportion of water used. The proportion of water used affects 
the tenacity and extensibility of the gluten and hence the resulting dough. 



PROPORTION OF INGREDIENTS USED IN BREAD 427 



Bailey and Le Vesconte have found that the extensibility of the dough 
increased with increasing water content until an imbibition equivalent to 
64 per cent of the weight of the flour was obtained. Further increase of 
water and increased hydration decreased the extensibility of the dough. 
The following table is from their results with the Chopin extensimeter.

Swanson and Working have reported in experiments with mechanical 
modification of the dough, using 340 grams of flour, that the best loaf 
of bread was produced when 205 to 215 cc. of water was used. In the 
proportions of water used by them the 205 cc. is equivalent to 60 per cent 
of the weight of the flour and 215 cc. to 63 per cent. When a smaller 
amount of water than 60 per cent was used a loaf of poor volume was 
obtained. 

Harrel has also reported that better bread is produced when the amount 
of water used is sufficient. Table 49 from his results is self-explanatory. 

The hydration capacity of different glutens varies, hence the maximum 
volume with any flour will be obtained with a definite water imbibition 
for that gluten. With increased swelling beyond the point at which the 
maximum volume is obtained the gluten becomes more tender and less 
tenacious, some of the cell walls collapse and coalesce, thus giving a smaller 
volume. With less swelling than the amount required to produce the 
maximum volume the tenacity is greater and a smaller volume results. The 
hydration of the gluten can be so great that there is a limit to the amount 
of stretching the gluten will stand and a very poor volume is the result. 

Sugar. Fitz reports that the average proportion of sugar used by bakers 
varies from 2 to 5 per cent. 

Shortening. Fitz has reported that the amount of shortening used by 
bakers varies from to 3 1/3 per cent. It is not necessary to add shortening

to make good bread, but Whymper states that even a low percentage adds 
to the keeping quality of the bread, for the bread stales less readily. 

Salt. Fritz has reported that the amount of salt used by bakers averages 
from 1.5 to 2 per cent and varies from 1.35 to 2.12 per cent. The use of 
salt is important in bread making. If it is not added to the dough, fer- 
mentation takes place very rapidly and the bread is too porous. If too much 
is used, fermentation is slow and the bread is firmer and more compact. 

Proportion of ingredients in bread dough. The committee on the stand- 
ardization of experimental baking tests of the A.A.C.C. have suggested 
formulas for baking tests, which are given in the laboratory outline. Experi- 
ment 73. 

Methods of mixing. Straight-dough process. Two processes are used 
in making bread. One is called the straight-dough process or quick method. 
In this process all the flour and other ingredients of the bread are mixed 
together in the dough for the whole fermentation period. 

Sponge process. By this method the salt and a part of the flour are 
omitted during the first part of the fermentation period. Then the re- 
mainder of the flour and the salt are added to make a dough, and from 
this point the manner of mixing and treatment of dough are the same for 
the two processes. The sponge method is always used with dry yeast and 
may be used with compressed yeast. 

Method of mixing ingredients. The committee on formula and 
method of mixing, Fitz chairman, have suggested the following procedure. 
"Thoroughly dissolve sugar and salt in a portion of the water, mix yeast 
in another. Use water at a temperature to bring dough out at approxi- 
mately 30°C. Add the solution to the flour, rinsing with balance of water, 
then add shortening in melted form. Mix thoroughly to a smooth dough. 
This may require 3 to 10 minutes depending on type of mechanical mixer 
used. Remove the dough, fold into smooth dough ball and place in battery 
jar (6 by 8 inches), cover, and place in dough cabinet at 30°C. and let 
rise until ready to punch." See Experiment 73. 



MANIPULATION OF DOUGH 



429 



Effect of mechanical treatment on extensibility of dough. Bailey 
and Le Vesconte have reported that prolonged mixing may destroy the 
cohesiveness of the gluten. 

The most extended experiments on the mechanical modification of gluten 
quality that have been reported are those of Swanson and Working. They 
devised a machine with a "pack-squeeze-pull-tear fashion." By mixing the 
dough for a longer time in this bread mixer they found that the bread could 
be baked at the end of the first fermentation period, thus decidedly shorten- 
ing the total time for fermentation. The prolonged mixing altered the 
gluten quality so that less time was needed for fermentation. ''The figures 
for volume, color and texture show a progressive improvement with the 
length of time of mixing." Dough mixed for 15 minutes produced a loaf 
better in every way than a loaf mixed 3 minutes and then fermented in 
the usual way. When the revolutions per minute were increased from 60 
to 120, it was found that 7 minutes would produce as good bread as 15 
minutes at the slower rate. The following table gives their results. The 
first figures are for the control fermented in the usual way after 3 minutes 
of mixing.

Manipulation of dough. In the laboratory in experimental cookery, 
one is constantly impressed by the effect of manipulation and the handling 
of the food materials in giving results that are not strictly uniform. 

Swanson states that it is well known that bread dough must not be 
squeezed too hard when kneaded just before it is put in the pan, or the cell 
walls will be thickened. He gives as the reason that during the fermenta- 



430 FLOUR AND BREAD 

tion the meshwork of gluten has become separated into fine filaments. If 
kneaded too hard just before being put in the pan these filaments are 
packed together and as a result a thicker cell wall is produced. 

The experiments of Dunlap are of particular interest. At the Bureau of 
Chemistry in Washington, he and two other operators mixed dough. The 
only difference in the mixing was the way the dough was kneaded or 
punched after the first mixing by the different operators. Dunlap's descrip- 
tion follows. "In these experiments the three operators used identical 
formulas and ingredients in preparing the dough batches. The mixers were 
all started at the same time, the water and shortening were added at the 
identical instant, and the extent of the mixing was absolutely uniform. 
All fermentations were carried out in the same cabinet and at the same 
time and for the same period. All punches were synchronous and the work- 
ing or punching of the dough was uniform, that is, the doughs were w^orked 
or punched with the hand 40 times after the first rise and 30 times after 
the second. The doughs went to the same proofing cabinet and at the same 
time. In fact uniformity so far as was humanly possible prevailed through- 
out. When the bakes came from the oven, the results were very illumi- 
nating for despite the care taken, they were far from uniform." These 
experiments were repeated several times with the same results. 

In later experiments carried on in another laboratory, Dunlap decided 
he had punished the dough too hard or used too much pressure in punch- 
ing it, especially for the last working. He states, ''Putting this idea to the 
test and handling the doughs with a degree of gentleness previously un- 
known in my method of operation, results were produced incomparably 
better than anything previously obtained." 

Applying these results it can be stated that the first mixing and knead- 
ing, when the gluten is developed, should be thorough, but may not need 
heavy pressure, and the second and third kneading should be done with 
light pressure and should not be continued for too long a period. 

The mixing of the bread in the bowl should be continued until the 
dough forms in a ball and cleans the side of the bowl. If a bread mixer 
is used it may mix and knead at the same time. 

For the first kneading, only a thin film of flour should be used on the 
board, unless far too much liquid has been added. Inexperienced bread 
makers usually add too much flour in kneading, for in mixing by hand 
the dough should be sticky when kneading is begun. After the gluten is 
developed it no longer sticks to the hands or board. In molding, use very 
little or preferably no flour, for flour added at this stage may produce 
streaks in the bread, since this flour is not fermented for the whole period. 

Greasing of bowl and pans. The bowl that the dough is allowed 
to rise in should have only a thin film of fat to grease the bowl, or it is 
not necessary to use any. Heavy greasing may produce streaks in the bread. 
Harrel found that bread baked in ungreased pans gave a better volume and 
oven spring than bread baked in greased pans. This indicates that the 



FERMENTATION 431 

dough clings to the sides of the pan during rising, and this adhesion aids in 
attaining a better volume. But greasing the bottom of the pan expedites 
removal of the bread. 

Fermentation. The production of gas in the dough to render the bread 
porous is known as fermentation. Both yeast and bacteria are used to pro- 
duce gas, bacteria producing the gas in salt-rising bread, yeast in ordinary 
bread. 

Microorganisms in breadmaking. Fuller states that the "microorganisms 
associated with the production of bread may be divided into three main 
groups: (1) the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, carefully purified and 
selected strains of which are purposely added to the dough; (2) certain 
bacteria, which, introduced either purposely or accidentally, assist in the 
development of the gluten and give rise to characteristic flavoring products ; 
and (3) the unwanted organisms, B. mesentericus, torulae, and moulds, 
which are introduced chiefly from flour, air, and perhaps water, uninten- 
tionally either into the dough or onto the baked loaf." 

Fuller states that it seems likely that attention has been confined too 
much to selecting and purifying yeasts in relation to their carbon dioxide 
producing powers and that side reactions, i.e., bacteria-producing, essential 
flavoring ingredients have been neglected. He cites the work of a Russian 
microbiologist who examined the bacterial flora of a number of samples of 
*'leaven." The dominant organism in all was Lactobacillus panis acidi, 
with Streptococcus lactis acidi and others in small numbers. Adding Lacto- 
bacillus panis acidi to yeast gave a bread with flavor superior to that of 
bread in which yeast alone was used. 

Enzyme action in fermentation. The yeast contains an enzyme, zymase, 
that produces carbon dioxide and alcohol from the sugar. During fermenta- 
tion many changes are occurring in the dough. The flour enzymes as well 
as the yeast enzymes bring about definite reactions. The chief amylolytic 
enzyme of the flour, diastase, produces maltose from starch. Flour contains 
some initial sugar but this is used up in gas production and it is essential 
for sugar to be formed for new gas production. Yeast also contains some 
diastase. Sugar is usually added to bread dough. It is not essential, but 
fermentation is more rapid. Most flours contain sufficient diastase for bread 
making, but in some the diastatic activity is weak. Commercial bakers may 
add diastase preparations to dough made of flours weak in diastase to 
shorten the fermentation time. 

Sugar is often added in rather large quantities in home-made bread and 
it, plus the sugars already present in the flour, plus the sugar formed by 
the diastase during fermentation, furnish the sugar for the action of the 
zymase to produce carbon dioxide. 

The proteinases hydrolize a part of the protein, and if very active may cause 
harmful results. For, if the gluten, which during the first part of fermenta- 
tion may be too tenacious, becomes too soft or thin the volume of the loaf 
may be diminished and the texture impaired. Balls and Hale say a little 



432 FLOUR AND BREAD 

proteinase is beneficial. J0rgensen states that yeast water stimulates the 
activity of proteinase. 

''Bread improvers." Many and various substances have been suggested 
and tried as so-called "bread improvers." Malt preparations containing 
both diastase and proteinase are sometimes added to dough. They are of 
greater benefit if added to flours low in natural diastase. The rate of 
diastatic activity may depend upon the relative percentage of starch which 
is embedded in gluten, the size of the starch granules, and other factors. 
With many granules embedded in gluten the diastase has less surface on 
which to act. If the starch granules are smaller there is a relatively greater 
area for the action of the diastase. However, Markley and Bailey in their 
investigations found particle size did not determine diastatic activity, but 
that the rate was affected by humidity of the granule surface, possibly be- 
cause the granule wall is less resistant. 

At present potassium bromate is commonly added to bread dough by 
commercial bakers. j0rgensen states that it imparts a beneficial action 
because it diminishes the action of the proteinase. Balls and Hale attribute 
part of the improvement of bleaching and aging of flour to diminution of 
proteinase activity. J0rgensen has applied for a patent in the United States 
for using ascorbic acid as a bread improver, its beneficial effects being at- 
tributed to its ability to depress plant-proteinases of the papain-type. 

Imbibition of water during fermentation. Sharp and Gortner have found 
that during yeast fermentation the imbibition of water increases to a maxi- 
mum and then decreases. The increased imbibition during fermentation 
is due to the increase in the hydration capacity of the glutenin. During 
fermentation the acidity increases, but Johnson and Bailey have reported 
that the acids of fermentation cannot alone produce all the changes that 
occur during fermentation. The proteolytic enzymes by hydrolyzing a part 
of the protein aid in softening of the gluten. Swanson and Working have 
suggested that the mechanical action of the expanding gas by stretching 
the gluten also aids in bringing about a modification of the gluten. 

Dispersion of gluten during fermentation. Johnson and Bailey in study- 
ing the efifect of hydrogen-ion concentration on dispersion of the gluten 
of the flour found that as the acidity increased the percentage of proteins 
dispersed or the protein in the aqueous extract of the fermented dough 
increased. It is either very diflficult or impossible to collect the gluten from 
a dough that has fermented sufficiently for baking, by washing it in water. 
This in itself shows a change in the condition of the gluten. 

Johnson and Bailey have reported the following amount of protein 
dispersed, or in the aqueous extract, during fermentation of a soft-wheat 
dough, without added salt. At an optimum pYi for baking the bread, more 
than half the protein was in a dispersed phase. 

Desirable acidity for bread. As fermentation of the dough progresses its 
acidity is increased. Johnson has reported that some lactic and acetic acids 
are formed during fermentation. Bailey and Sherwood have shown that in

bread dough the increased acidity is largely due to carbon dioxide. The />H 
of the baked bread is always higher than that of the dough from which 
it is baked. For an average gluten a ^H of about 5 is desirable. With all 
doughs, if the fermentation is carried too far the volume of the bread is 
poor and it has a sour odor and flavor. The following table is from Bailey 
and Sherwood.

Length of fermentation period. The total length of the fermenta- 
tion period depends upon the proportion of yeast used and the temperature 
at which the sponge or dough is kept. The first rising should double in 
bulk and should spring back easily when pressed with the finger. It is 
usually given the longest period and often requires 70 per cent of the 
total fermentation time. The dough is then punched and worked lightly to 



434 FLOUR AND BREAD 

allow the gas to escape. The second rising requires a shorter time than 
the first one, and the dough may be punched and molded and placed in the 
pans. Very strong glutens may be allowed to rise a third time before putting 
in the pan. 

Dunlap has reported that, with a high initial hydrogen-ion concentra- 
tion, or induced acidity, produced by the addition of acid or some substance 
that increases the acidity, better bread is secured if the fermentation periods 
are reversed, that is the first rising period is short, and the second longer. 

If the dough is baked before fermentation has progressed far enough, the 
resulting bread has thick cell walls and is decidedly less tender than bread 
fermented sufficiently. The volume is also smaller. This is because the 
gluten with the proper length of fermentation becomes more dispersed and 
tender. If fermentation is carried too far the gluten becomes too soft 
to retain all the expanding gas bubbles and several cells coalesce, which 
produces thick cell walls and coarse texture. With extreme fermentation 
the dough smells sour, and a very coarse, heavy, compact bread of small 
volume and sour taste is obtained. 

Prevention of crust forination during fermentation. Drying of the crust 
may be partially or wholly prevented by covering, keeping in a cabinet with 
high humidity, or greasing the crust. 

A crust formed after the dough is panned gives a dry layer on top that 
is less elastic. Often a layer of compact grained cells is formed just below 
the crust because of the drying of the crust, and as a result it is inelastic. 
The drying in the pan may be prevented in the same way as during rising, 
or the crust may be moistened with water occasionally. 

Size of pan. The volume of the loaf and the shape of cells of the bread 
depend upon the method of panning and the relation of the amount of 
dough to the size of the pan. 

When the dough is placed on one side of the pan so that it has to turn 
over in rising the volume is reduced and the loaf is likely to crack in the 
center from pressure. The dough should be placed in the middle of the 
pan and shaped so that it is uniform. Harrel found that, with conditions 
otherwise standardized, a loaf placed slightly to the side of the pan gave 
a volume of 2700 cc. but placed in the middle of the pan gave a volume 
of 3230 cc. 

Lewis and Whitcomb in their investigations on the "Influence of Size 
and Shape of Pan on Baking Test" concluded that the purpose for which 
the pan is intended should govern its shape and size. An experimental 
bake is a test of the strength of the flour; for this purpose a pan should 
be used that puts a more severe test upon the flour. Their conclusions 
are as follows. "The shape of the pan exerts a marked influence upon the 
size and quality of the loaf in both strong and weak flours. 

"The proof period varies with different types of pans. It does not corre- 
spond closely with volume or height of loaf or quality of bread. 

"Deeper pans produce taller loaves, but not the larger loaves. 



USE OF SOFT-WHEAT FLOUR IN BREAD MAKING 435 

"The deep type of pan produces a smaller loaf of somewhat poorer 
quality than the shallow type. Hence a flour that will produce a good loaf 
in a deep pan can be depended upon to perform well in the bake shop 
where the shallow type of pan is used." 

The committee on standard formulas and procedure of A.A.C.C. have 
suggested a pan of the following dimensions for a pound loaf of bread for 
an experimental bake. Top 7^ by 4^, bottom 7 by 33^2, height 3^/2 
inches. 

Temperature and time of baking. The 1926-27 committee on baking, 
Blish, chairman, of A.A.C.C. have recommended baking a pound loaf 
of bread for 35 minutes at a temperature of 220°C. For the small loaf 
made with 100 grams of flour they recommend 25 minutes at 220°C. 
Larger loaves of bread will require a longer baking period and better results 
will be obtained with a lower baking temperature. The baking temperature 
depends somewhat upon the volume attained during rising. If the volume 
is great enough the temperature should be high ; if the bread is not proofed 
quite enough a lower temperature will allow it to rise more in the oven. 

Flavor of bread. Visser't Hooft and de Leeuw have reported that 
excellent flavor in bread is caused by two factors. One factor is a blend of 
the flavors of the various ingredients of the bread and the other is diacetyl, 
an important flavor constituent of butter. Acetylmethylcarbinol is formed 
in the dough as a by-product of fermentation of sugar by yeast. In the 
finished loaf acetylmethylcarbinol slowly oxidizes to diacetyl. But the 
amount of acetylmethylcarbinol formed depends upon many factors. The 
following are reported to have a favorable influence : high sugar-yeast ratio, 
diastase preparations, low fermentation temperature, short fermentation 
time, sponge-dough method, hydrogen acceptors or oxidizing agents, oxygen, 
and proper yeast selection. 

The use of soft-wheat flour in bread making. There is a large 
production of soft-wheat flour in some sections of the United States. Winter 
wheat, by which is meant wheat planted in the fall, is often called soft 
wheat. There are two types of winter wheat, one of which produces a 
soft-wheat flour and the other a hard-wheat flour. The type produced 
depends upon the place grown and the variety of wheat. Soft wheat is more 
generally grown in the southern states and soft-wheat flour is used exten- 
sively in the South. 

Soft-wheat flour can be used in baking bread, but the manipulation re- 
quired is different from that for strong-wheat flour. The gluten in soft- 
wheat flour is less colloidal, more dispersed, than in strong-wheat flour. 
Since fermentation produces greater dispersion of the gluten, which gives 
greater elasticity, and a more tender gluten, the fermentation period is 
necessarily shorter for soft-wheat flour than for strong-wheat flour. Better 
results are also obtained if the proportion of yeast is increased. With in- 
creased yeast the sugar is usually increased, as it furnishes a quick food 



436 FLOUR AND BREAD 

supply for the yeast. Soft-wheat flours do not have so high a hydration 
capacity as strong wheat, so that it is necessary to use a smaller proportion 
of liquid. A shallow pan gives better results than a deep one. 

Davis and Cline have reported that the best results are obtained with a 
short fermentation period. They state, "The best results were obtained by 
allowing the dough to double its volume for the first rising, the bread is 
then panned, and allowed to treble its volume in the pan." The trebling 
of the volume in the pan "overcomes the close, cake-like texture and small 
volume." 

Liquid. Davis and Cline state that "To a certain point loaf volume and 
loaf weight increase with an increase in the proportion of liquid used." A 
more open porous structure is obtained with increased water ; with too 
high a percentage of water the texture becomes too coarse. With the flour 
used by Davis and Cline, they have found that 52 per cent of water gives 
the best loaf and texture. This proportion of water gives a dough so soft 
that it is necessary to handle it quickly to prevent its sticking to the bread 
board and hands during the kneading and molding. 

Yea;st, The quantity of yeast used for soft-wheat bread is increased from 
2 to 3 times the amount used in the formula for strong-wheat flour. This 
requires 1^ to 2 cakes of yeast for a pound loaf of bread. 

Sugar. Davis and Cline state that increase of sugar with soft-wheat flours 
gives a loaf with excellent oven spring, with a silky, spongy, moist texture, 
for the increased sugar seems to have a toughening action on the gluten. 
The loaf browns better in the oven with the increased sugar. They have 
decided that 17 grams, about 1^ tablespoons, for a pound loaf, gives the 
best results. A larger proportion of sugar, 25 to 35 grams or 2 to 3 table- 
spoons, yields a loaf of larger volume, but the bread is too sweet. 

Salt. Salt retards fermentation and depresses the hydration capacity of 
gluten. Davis and Cline have reported that 5 grams or about 1 teaspoon 
for a pound loaf produces the best results for soft wheat. Increasing the 
quantity increases the length of time required for fermentation and gives 
a more compact, tough loaf. 

Shortening. Two teaspoons per pound loaf produced good results but 
Davis and Cline have found that increasing the fat to 1 or 1^^ tablespoons 
gives an increased volume and sheen but also requires a longer fermen- 
tation. 

The staling o£ bread. Aside from the organoleptic means of detect- 
ing staling, several methods have been used by investigators. Karacsonyi has 
reported the use of the viscosimeter for this purpose. Piatt summarizes 
these methods and reviews the literature on staling. When soaked in an 
excess of water stale bread does not swell to the extent that fresh bread 
does. When viewed with the microscope the starch granules in stale bread 
have a more distinct outline, and often an air space occurs between the 
starch and gluten. The water extract from fresh bread contains more 



THE STALING OF BREAD 437 

soluble starch products than that from stale bread. Fresh bread is more 
elastic than stale bread, hence measuring the compressibility is also a means 
of determining the degree of staling. 

Staling includes all the changes taking place during the storage of bread, 
cake, pastry, etc. These changes include volatile losses, changes that may 
be due to oxidation, and most important, changes that occur within the 
product, which Piatt terms "inherent staling." 

The volatile losses are largely composed of water, but include small 
amounts of carbon dioxide, alcohol, acetic acid, diacetyl, and other sub- 
stances, all of which give the distinctive aroma to fresh bread. The moisture 
loss can be largely prevented. 

Stale crackers, fruit cake, and other products often deteriorate in flavor 
because of the oxidation of the fats they contain. 

Even if moisture loss is prevented from a loaf of bread certain changes 
take place within the loaf which give it a flinty feel and a crumbly texture. 
Colloidal systems change slowly and temperature may have a decided effect 
on the change. In baking, as the gelatinization temperature of the starch 
is reached, the starch swells, absorbing whatever moisture it can obtain; 
but the gluten may lose moisture. However, as the bread cools part of 
the starch is precipitated and releases moisture, which may be absorbed by 
the gluten or become the source of the dampness of wrapped cool bread. 
The staling process is reversible, i.e., the stale bread when heated again 
to a high temperature acquires the characteristics of fresh bread. This 
reversal can be repeated several times or until the bread has lost too large 
a proportion of moisture. Though both starch and protein play a role in 
staling, more work has been done in studying the part starch plays than 
that of the protein. 

Not all the starch is gelatinized in baking, so that the freshly baked 
bread is not entirely transparent, but has more of a transparent appearance 
than stale bread. Bryant has reported the following percentage of soluble 
extract in one experiment: for dry flour after mixing 9.32 per cent, after 
proofing 10.52 per cent, 30 minutes after baking 13.82 per cent, 6 hours 
after baking 13.46 per cent, 24 hours after baking 11.92 per cent, and 
70 hours after baking 10.41 per cent. He adds that the effect of fat in 
bread in preventing staleness is not known, but that salt is supposed to 
tend to increase the staling in that starch changes more rapidly to insoluble 
starch if salt is present. 

Katz, between 1912 and 1916, made extensive investigations concern- 
ing the causes of bread becoming stale and means of preventing staling. He 
refers to staling as follows: "I concluded that staling may be ascribed to 
an alteration of the starch, partly gelatinized by the baking process, whereby 
the water-combining powers of starch are impaired or diminished. As a 
result, starch and the gluten skeleton are no longer in equilibrium with 
each other, the gluten taking up a certain quantity of water yielded by the 



438 FLOUR AND BREAD 

starch. The individual starch granules shrink somewhat and relax their 
union with the gluten skeleton which binds the partly gelatinized starch 
granules into a uniform whole. The loosening of this union is the basic 
cause of bread crumbling when the latter becomes stale. 

"It is known that another change takes place in the bread crumb when 
staling, namely, a hardening of the crumb. This change occurs even when 
loss of water on the part of the whole bread is precluded, which of the 
two processes will predominate, i.e., hardening or crumbling, depends on 
the nature of the bread." 

Katz and Vershaffelt have found that microscopic studies of fresh and 
stale bread show differences in the appearance of the starch granules. "In 
the stale bread the starch granules are more sharply contoured. Upon closer 
examination it was found that they were doubly contoured and that be- 
tween the two contours there was a fine air bubble. This distinction between 
fresh and stale bread can be detected invariably in all types of bread." 

Katz has also reported that hardening of the crumb occurs before crum- 
bling. For determining hardness of the crumb a special type of tester is 
used. The hardness is determined from the number of millimeters that a 
disc of 22.5-mm. diameter penetrated into the bread crumb, when loaded 
with a definite weight and allowed to act for a definite time. 

If the bread is kept at a temperature of 60°C. or above, and if moisture 
loss and condensation of water are prevented, the bread stays fresh indefi- 
nitely. Thus staling is brought about by cooling of the bread. Katz has 
reported that at 60°C. or above freshness of the bread is retained, at 
about 40 °C. it becomes approximately half stale, at 30 °C. it becomes 
still more stale, and at 17° to 0°C. it becomes totally stale. But although 
at 0°C. bread stales quickly, more intense cold inhibits staling. Katz recom- 
mends intense cold, — 8°C. or lower, as one means of preventing staling of 
bread. The chief objection to its use in bakeries is the cost. 

Storing the bread from 40° to 60°C. inhibits staling; the chief objec- 
tion to storing bread at these temperatures is that bacterial and mold 
growth may be favored. 

Whymper states that "The effect of freshness can be enormously in- 
creased and sustained for many days by the addition of small quantities 
of fat to the bread," and that the effect of fat on staleness is out of all pro- 
portion to the amount used. 

Whymper also states that staleness is hindered by increasing gluten in 
bread, or at least the addition of gluten to bread delays staleness. Bread 
made from milk stales more slowly than that made from water. Whymper 
suggests that fat and gluten prevent the deposition of starch in much the 
same way as they oppose the setting of cement. 

Ropy bread. So-called rope in bread or ropy bread is caused by 
B. mesentericus, accidentally introduced into the bread through the flour 
or other means. The spores of this bacteria are not destroyed by baking the 



REFERENCES 439 

bread. Two or three days after baking, and particularly during hot weather, 
the center of the loaf acquires a peculiar gummy, sometimes crumbly 
texture, which spreads to the edges of the loaf. The development of rope 
can be prevented by increasing the acidity of the bread. Thus the whey of 
sour milk can be used for the liquid in home baking or vinegar can be 
added. It has been reported that only about 1 per cent of vinegar is re- 
quired. Other suggestions are to have materials and flour bins scrupu- 
lously clean, to increase the amount of yeast, thus shortening the fermenta- 
tion period, to avoid low temperatures during fermentation, and to cool 
the baked loaf rapidly.

Use the large or small dough for baking. The fermentation time for the 
large dough or large loaf is 265 minutes or nearly 4}^ hours. That for the 
small dough or small loaf is 290 minutes or nearly 5 hours. If a shorter 
fermentation period is desired increase the amount of yeast used as suggested 
in Table 47 and decrease the fermentation time for punches and panning 
accordingly. 

Determine the temperature of the water necessary to bring the dough to 
28°C. This may be done for the first trial by taking the temperature of the 
room plus the temperature of the flour and substracting from 84. The result 
will be the temperature of water to use, to bring the dough out at 28°C. 
This will not always bring the temperature of the dough out at 28°C., espe- 
cially if the temperature of the room is rather low and mixing is continued 
for some time. To find the temperature of the water to bring the dough out 
at 30°C., subtract the temperature of the room plus the temperature of the 
flour from 90. 

Sift the flour. Dissolve the sugar and salt in a portion of the water and 
mix the yeast in another part. Add water and melted fat to the flour and mix 
to a smooth dough. If a bread mixer is used, mix until the dough is smooth. 
Keep a record of the time and mix other batches of dough for the same 
length of time. If mixed with a spoon mix until a dough is formed, then 
knead on a flat surface until smooth. The length of time for kneading depends 
upon the vigor and rapidity of kneading. It is better to work out a definite 
method of kneading and count the punches used. Otherwise the amount of 
kneading will produce variations and it will then be difficult to determine 
variations due to other causes. Try 300 punches, unless it is found that, 



BREAD 



445 



owing to method of kneading or other factors, more or less kneading gives 
better results. 

For fermentation place in a container of suitable size and cover. To obtain 
a constant temperature in a cooking laboratory the dough may be placed in a 
covered bowl or pan and set in a dishpan of water, the water being at the 
desired temperature for fermentation. Add hot water as needed to keep the 
temperature constant. The dishpan should be covered to avoid drafts over 
the top of the bread. 

An empty refrigerator makes an ideal proofing cabinet, as it is easy to reg- 
ulate the temperature by a pan of hot water in the bottom, and it is moist so 
that there is no tendency for the crust to dry. A china closet, a box, or an 
oven can also be used. 

Leave the dough in the container for the punches and punch just sufficiently 
to bring the dough to the original volume. Count the strokes used for punch- 
ing and use the same for all the doughs and the same method of making 
strokes. For panning, turn out on a smooth surface and knead or fold gently 
into the desired shape. Use no flour to mold as this flour will not be fermented 
for the same length of time as that in the dough and may leave streaks in the 
bread. 

Prevent a crust from forming while rising and while in the pan. If neces- 
sary, moisten the top occasionally with water. 

1. Use 55 per cent of water or 192.5 cc. 

2. Use 57.5 per cent of water or 201.2 cc. 

3. Use 60 per cent of water or 210 cc.

446 FLOUR AND BREAD 

1. Use the proportion of water found best under Experiment 73. If this has 
not been determined, try 60 per cent. Follow directions for mixing given 
under Experiment 73. Mix 3 times the recipe used. Knead as in Experiment 
73, using 400 punches. Weigh the dough and divide into 3 portions. Put part 
one in the proofing cabinet to rise. Use the remainder of the dough for 2 and 3. 

2. Continue kneading one part of the dough from 74,1, for 15 to 20 minutes 
or use 1000 punches. For the rest of the operations duplicate the procedure 
under 1. 

3. Put the third portion of the dough from 74,1, to rise. When punching 
after the first fermentation period use more strokes for punching and more 
pressure. Knead hard just before molding the loaf to put in the baking pan. 

B. Method of molding. 

Repeat Al, using the regular recipe. When molding the dough for the 
baking pan pat gently into a long narrow strip that can be' rolled for the loaf. 
Roll around about 2 times and shape and place in pan. 

Compare the appearance, volume, texture, and tenderness of the loaves of 
bread. Compare the shape and direction of cells in the baked loaves. Does roll- 
ing compress a part of the dough so that some cells are more compressed than 
others? 

Experiment 75. 

To determine the effect of fermentation on the volume, the texture, and the 
tenderness of bread. 

Mix 2 times the recipe used. Follow directions given under Experiment 
73, using the proportion of water that gave the best loaf. If this has not been 
determined use 60 per cent. After kneading, weigh and then divide into 2 
parts. Mold and shape one loaf and place directly in the baking pan. Let rise 
to the desired height and then bake. The second half of the dough should 
be fermented and punched in the regular way before molding and baking. Com- 
pare the two loaves for volume, appearance, color of crumb, texture, and 
tenderness.

CHAPTER Xll 

BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

Leavening Agents 

A leavening agent is a substance that forms bubbles of gas in a batter or 
dough, thus leavening it or making it porous. During the baking the ex- 
pansion of the gas produced stretches the batter ; then the heat coagulation 
of the protein of the flour or of the flour and eggs sets the dough structure. 

Yeast produces carbon dioxide gas in doughs, but with yeast a period of 
time is necessary for enough gas to be produced to leaven the dough suf- 
ficiently before the product can be baked. 

Steam. One of the simplest ways of leavening is by steam. One volume 
of water forms more than 1600 volumes of water vapor, so that steam 
may have considerable leavening ability. Steam is most effective as a leaven- 
ing agent in thin batters in which the proportion of water is large, such as 
popovers and cream puffs. Medium batters, of which griddle cakes and 
muffins are examples, are partially leavened by steam and partially by the 
gas produced from the added baking powder. Steam does not aid to such 
a great extent in leavening the batters and doughs containing little water 
both because of the small proportion of water used and because of the large 
amount held by the starch and protein. 

Soda. Sodium bicarbonate or soda may be used for a leavening agent. 
When heated it gives off gas as follows : 

2 NaHCOs + Heat > Na2C03 + H2O + CO2 

sodium sodium water carbon 

bicarbonate carbonate dioxide 

The residue, sodium carbonate, gives a disagreeable taste and produces a 
yellow color in the baked product. For this reason some substance is used 
with soda that combines with it to give an end product that does not affect 
the flavor or color of the food so decidedly as does sodium carbonate. 

Hydrochloric acid. The following reaction is typical of baking 
powder reactions in that an acid substance is combined with the soda to 
produce the gas. According to Hart, the first patent for a baking powder, 
taken by Dr. Whiting in 1837 in England, was for the formula given 
below. In the baking powders of today an acid salt, in powder form, 
replaces the acid of this formula.

acid bicarbonate dioxide chloride

448 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

Baking ammonia. Baking ammonia has been used for years in baked 
products and is still used in many bakeries for some goods. Baking am- 
monia is ammonium bicarbonate; when heated it breaks up to form am- 
monia, water, and carbon dioxide. Since two gases are produced it is a 
very efficient leavening agent. The chief objection to its use is that, unless 

NH4HCO3 + heat > NH3 + H2O + CO2 

ammonium ammonia water carbon 

bicarbonate dioxide 

all the ammonium bicarbonate is broken up and all the ammonia gas 
driven off, the taste and smell of ammonia remain in the baked product. 
For this reason it is used in baked products like cookies and cream puffs, 
that are small and thin or have thin walls. 

The author was interested in looking over several hundred cooky recipes 
sent in from all over the United States for a magazine cooking contest in 
1927. The surprising thing about them was the length of time some of the 
recipes must have been used by, or handed down to, a family, for great 
numbers of them called for leavening agents in common use years ago. 
There were many that called for baking ammonia, frequently with no 
definite proportions, for the recipe would state to use three or five cents 
worth of ammonia. 

Baking ammonia is in rather coarse crystals as it is obtained at the 
drug store, and therefore produces better results if dissolved in the liquid 
before it is added to the dough. 

Sour milk. The use of sour milk and soda to produce carbon dioxide 
gas in baked products antedates the use of baking powder. As the acidity 
of the milk varies with Its age and degree of sourness, the amount of soda 
needed to neutralize the acidity will vary. Some recipes call for more 
soda than is needed to neutralize the acid of the milk, thus an excess is 
left that forms sodium carbonate with its resulting bad after-taste and 
yellow color. This is probably the reason that many present-day house- 
keepers do not like to use It. Then some cooks do not learn to vary the 
proportion of soda to use with the milk. 

Slightly sour or "bllnky" milk will combine with very little soda, but 
very sour milk will require a larger quantity. An average amount for 
ordinary sour milk is ^ teaspoon of soda per cup of sour milk. This pro- 
duces gas equivalent to the amount produced by about 2 teaspoons of 
baking powder. As this does not always produce as porous a texture as 
is desired, some baking powder may also be added. It is preferable from the 
color and the flavor obtained in baked and steamed batters to use too little 
soda to neutralize the acid in the milk, rather than an excess. In fact, sour 
milk can be used In muffins, biscuits, and cakes with baking powder and 
no soda, with far less perceptible taste than when excess soda Is used. 

Many recipes state in the directions to dissolve the soda in a small 
amount of water. This seems to hold over from the days when soda like 



CREAM OF TARTAR 449 

the baking ammonia was coarse and not finely powdered, and the solution 
in water prevented the formation of brown spots. This is a good method 
if the soda is added directly to the batter, for it tends to lump in the 
package. But finely powdered soda such as is used at the present time may 
be sifted with the flour, though it is true that different brands may differ 
in fineness of division. 

Some recipes state to mix the soda with the sour milk or molasses before 
combining with the other ingredients. This is not a good practise since gas 
begins to evolve as soon as the two are mixed and thus a large portion of 
the gas is useless as a leavening agent. 

Molasses. Daniels and Heisig have reported the acidity of molasses, 
honey, and corn sirup. Cooking molasses and sorghum, like sour milk, vary 
in acidity, so that the amount of soda required to neutralize the acid varies. 
Some require Yi teaspoon of soda per cup, others ^, and some 1 teaspoon. 
An average amount is about ^ of a teaspoon per cup of molasses. How- 
ever, the strong flavor of the molasses may mask the flavor caused by the 
excess soda to a certain extent, so that one is often safe in using the amount 
required for the molasses containing the highest proportion of acid, i.e., 
1 teaspoon per cup. 

Many old recipes containing molasses, like those containing sour milk, 
call for excess soda. In the cooky contest previously mentioned, it was not 
uncommon to find recipes that called for Yi cup of soda for 3 quarts of 
molasses and a pint of sour cream or milk. 

Honey and corn sirup. The acidity of honey as reported by Daniels 
and Heisig varies. For the samples they tried they report that from Yi 
to 1/12 of a teaspoon of soda was required to neutralize the acidity of 1 
cup of honey. This acidity is so low that it is hardly worth while to add 
soda for neutralizing. The acidity of corn sirup is very much lower than 
that of honey. 

Cream of tartar. Cream of tartar is an acid salt and combines with 
soda to form carbon dioxide gas. It was used extensively before baking 
powders came into common use. Many recipes still state to use cream of 
tartar and soda for the leavening agent, and many of them call for equal 
amounts of these two ingredients. As the weight of a teaspoon of soda or 
of cream of tartar is practically the same, an excess of soda is left in the 
baking mixture when equal measures of the two are used, for by weight 
188 parts of cream of tartar combine with 84 parts of soda to form 18 
parts of water, 44 parts of carbon dioxide, and 210 parts of sodium potas- 
sium tartrate. These proportions by measure are approximately 2^4 tea- 
spoons of cream of tartar to a teaspoon of soda.

Baking Powder 

Hart states that baking powder was first used in England about 1830. 
It was made of "pearlash and alum, and later of sesquicarbonate of am- 
monia." When crystalline substances were mixed with soda, a wider use 
was insured for baking powder, for with the dry salts, reactions of the 
baking powder did not take place until it was moistened, and the alkaline 
and acid substances could be kept in the same container. 

The ideal baking powder. Hart states that "From the standpoint 
of the consumer, the ideal baking powder (a) gives the most gas for the 
least volume and weight of powder; (b) gives the gas slowly when cold 
and increasingly in the cooking dough, so the dough may be mixed cold 
and left standing several hours; begins to generate gas in quantity in the 
oven and ceases to generate when it would rupture the crumb; (r) leaves a 
tasteless and absolutely harmless residue in the bread; (d) is cheap; (e) 
keeps well. The chemicals should not react on one another in the can and 
thus lose strength." 

Carbon dioxide. Under the United States Food and Drugs Act, the 
following definition for baking powder was formulated, "Baking powder is 
the leavening agent produced by the mixing of an acid reacting material 
and sodium bicarbonate with or without starch or flour. 

"It yields not less than 12 per cent of available carbon dioxide." 

The principal reason for adding starch to baking powder is for a 
standardizing agent. To some extent it also absorbs moisture, thus lessen- 
ing the gas lost during storage by reaction of the ingredients and for a 
standardizing agent. The federal standard requires 12 per cent of available 
carbon dioxide, but most of the baking powders made for home use yield 
14 per cent of carbon dioxide. Starch is added to each type of baking 
powder in amounts so that 100 grams of the powder yield 14 per cent 
carbon dioxide. If the amount of gas produced by a definite weight of 
baking powder were not standardized there would be great difficulty in 
substituting some types of powders for others in recipes. For under these 
conditions the amount of carbon dioxide produced by a teaspoon of powder 
would vary far more than it does when the powder yields 14 per cent of 
carbon dioxide. 

The carbon dioxide of baking powders is classified as total, available, 
and residual. The total carbon dioxide is all the carbon dioxide contained 
in the powder and may be obtained by using acid with it. The residual 
carbon dioxide is that remaining in the powder after water has been mixed 
with it and heat has been applied. Available carbon dioxide represents the 
difference between total and residual and is the amount usually obtained 
under baking conditions. 

Types of baking powders. The alkaline ingredient of all baking 
powders is soda. The acid ingredient varies, and the names of the various 



TYPES OF BAKING POWDERS 451 

types of baking powders refer to the kind of compound used for the acid 
ingredient. The function of the acid salt is the same regardless of the type 
of salt used. It combines with and releases the CO2 from the soda. The 
types of baking powders are (1) tartrate, (2) phosphate, (3) sulfate, and 
(4) a combination of sulfate and phosphate. 

Tartrate powders. The tartrate powders on the market consist of cream 
of tartar or a combination of cream of tartar and tartaric acid. Tartaric 
acid is not used alone in baking powders. The objections to using it alone 
as given by Hart are that "Its reaction is rapid and complete in cold water, 
and its keeping quality correspondingly poor." Cream of tartar reacts more 
slowly than tartaric acid but keeps and aerates well. 

The residue left from cream of tartar and soda is ''Rochelle" salts. See 
the reaction under cream of tartar. Tartaric acid leaves sodium tartrate as 
a residue.

Phosphate powders. Three phosphate compounds are or have been used 
In baking powder. Monosodium phosphate has been used, but so far as the 
author knows no baking powders on the market at present contain it. 
Monocalcium phosphate is most frequently used. Lately sodium acid pyro- 
phosphate is being used in considerable quantities by commercial bakers. 
Phosphoric acid forms three series of salts, such as Na3P04, NaoHP04, 
and NaH2P04. The first is not formed in baked products. Davis and 
Maveety state that the monosodium phosphate (NaH2P04), disodium 
phosphate (NaoHP04), tricalcium phosphate (Ca3(P04)2), and dical- 
cium phosphate (CaHP04) are found in the residue after the baking 
powder has reacted. They state that the reaction is carried to completion 
with the formation of Na2HP04 and Ca3(P04)2 only when an excess of 
hydroxyl ions is present. 

Bailey gives three equations which represent the reactions that may take 
place under favorable conditions. He adds that equation (3) represents 
what probably usually occurs. 

2CaH4(P04)2 + 4NaHC03 > 2CaHP04 + 2Na2HP04 + 4CO2 4- 4H2O (1) 
3CaH4(P04)2 4- 4NaHC03 > Ca3(P04)2 4- 4NaH2P04 + 4CO2 + 4H2O (2) 
3CaH4(P04)2 4- SNaHCOs > Ca3(P04)2 + 4Na2HP04 + 8CO2 4- 8H0O (3) 

With sodium acid pyrophosphate Bailey states that there is some ques- 
tion concerning the products of reaction and gives two equations that may 
represent what occurs.

Sodium acid pyrophosphate is at present put up with cornstarch and 
sold only to bakers. The bakers add the soda, using 2 parts of combined 
starch and disodium pyrophosphate to 1 part of soda. This proportion yields 
about 17 per cent of available carbon dioxide. Some of the other baking 
powders for the bakery trade are also made to yield 17 per cent of carbon 
dioxide. 

Sulfate powders. The author knows of no straight sulfate powders on 
the market at the present time. Sodium aluminum sulfate is the acid salt 
used in these powders. 

Combination sulfate-phosphate powders. These powders contain two acid 
salts in varying proportions. The sulfate salt is sodium aluminum sulfate 
and the phosphate is monocalcium phosphate. Hart states that sodium 
aluminum sulfate "has first class keeping quality and has an aerating value 
about the same as tartartic acid." The reaction of the phosphate salt with 
soda has been given above. One ingredient of the residue of sulfate powders 
is aluminum hydroxide. Another is sodium sulfate. The latter in excess 
produces a bitter taste. The sodium aluminum sulfate is first hydrolyzed 
with water. The sulfuric acid formed then reacts with the sodium bicar- 
bonate. Bailey states that ''Besides the reaction of the phosphate and sodium 

Na2S04 Al2(S04)3 + 6H2O > Na2S04 + 2A1(0H)3 + 3H2SO4 
3H2SO4 + 6NaHC03 > 6CO2 + 6H2O + 3Na2S04 

aluminum sulfate with soda, there is probably an interaction between the 
two." 

The preceding Graphic Chart by Dr. Chittick shows *'the ingredients 
present in the various types of baking powders, proportioned to produce 
14 per cent of gas, which is the average strength of the standard baking 
powders." It also shows the compounds formed from the reaction of the 
various baking powders and the percentage or possible percentage of these 
compounds. 

Chittick has suggested calling baking powders containing the sodium 
aluminum sulfate salt (sometimes known as aluminum or S.A.S. baking 
powder) sulfate powders, which is a good suggestion. He also suggests 
that baking powders consisting of a combination of sodium aluminum 
sulfate and phosphate salts be called sulfate-phosphate baking powder. 
These changes are shown in the Baking Powder Chart. Because of the 
number of times names of types of baking powder are used in the labora- 
tory outline, the author has used the abbreviation, S.-P., for sulfate- 
phosphate powders. 

Temperature and reaction of baking powder. Sulfate powder re- 
acts slowly at room temperature. Bailey states that at room temperature a 
tartrate baking powder will react completely, a straight phosphate will 
yield two-thirds of its gas, but heat is required to liberate the remainder, 
and a combination powder will liberate from one-fifth to one-third of its

gas. The baking powders that liberate a larger proportion of carbon dioxide 
at room temperature are often referred to as rapid acting; those liberating 
a small proportion at room temperature are called slow acting. Bailey 
classes sodium acid pyrophosphate as a slow-acting powder. Barackman 
states that it may be classed as a rapid-acting powder in water but a slow 
one in a dough. Sulfate-phosphate is a combination of a rapid- and a slow- 
acting powder. It can be readily seen that it is possible for some types of 
powder to lose a larger proportion of gas during mixing than other types 
of powder. For this reason a smaller amount of the slow-acting powders 
can be used in many baked products. 

The amount of carbon dioxide lost from a batter. A smaller pro- 
portion of gas is lost from a batter during mixing than from water, owing 
at least in part to the density and viscosity of the dough mixture. Noble 
and Halliday have done considerable work with baking powder. The fol- 
lowing table from their results shows the comparative loss from water and 
from a simplified dough mixture after mixing for 40 seconds. They have 
also determined the amount of carbon dioxide evolved in a simplified batter 
during 40 seconds' mixing. This was only slightly greater than the amount 
lost from the batter, as shown in Table 53.

Barackman states that for baking purposes the carbon dioxide from bak- 
ing powder may be divided into three divisions as follows: "1. the amount 
lost from a dough during mixing and standing ; 2. the amount causing 
expansion of the dough; this is called 'bench action' by bakers; 3. the 
amount of carbon dioxide dissolved and adsorbed and that available from 
unreacted soda which will be effective as leavening at oven heat." Barack- 
man has determined the carbon dioxide for these three divisions in biscuits 
and doughnuts. Instead of using baking powder he used acid salts and soda 
in the dough mixtures. The acid salts used were calcium acid phosphate, 
sodium acid pyrophosphate, potassium acid tartrate (cream of tartar), and 
sulfate-phosphate. For convenience dry mixes were made up to which water 
was later added in a special mixing apparatus. The dry mix for biscuits 
contained flour, soda 1.5 per cent (flour basis), acid salt, and shortening 
10 per cent. The dry doughnut mixture contained flour, soda, acid salt, 
shortening 5.55 per cent, sugar 22.2 per cent, powdered egg 3.33 per cent, 
and dry skim milk 10 per cent. When water was mixed with the dry in- 
gredients heat was evolved. This made it necessary to use control doughs 
containing no acid salt or soda, to correct for the expansion of occluded air 
in the dough. The doughs all had a final temperature of 27°C. =^ 0.5°.

FINENESS OF DIVISION OF BAKING POWDER 455 



Barackman's results for the rate of reaction of sodium acid pyrophosphate 
are given in Table 54. 

From the results obtained Barackman concluded that a rapid-acting bak- 
ing acid caused a larger loss of carbon dioxide from the dough during 
mixing, whereas a slow-acting acid has a smaller loss and consequently a 
greater quantity of available gas left In the dough for baking. "Of the 
gas generated during mixing only 20 to 30 per cent is retained by the 
doughs. This, plus the gas in the undecomposed soda, Is available for 
leavening In the oven. No appreciable loss of gas occurs after mixing." 

In the following tables the specific volume was obtained by dividing the 
volume of the biscuits or cake by their weight.

* E.xception due to eflFect of acid on colloidal properties of dough. 

Barackman's conclusion was that a correlation exists between the carbon 
dioxide left in doughs after mixing and the volume of the baked product. 
**The major portion (70 to 80 per cent) of the carbon dioxide generated 
from baking powders during the mixing of doughs is lost." In the above 
table the reduced specific volume is due to the biscuits being mixed and 
allowed to stand 15 minutes before cutting and baking. The controls were 
baked within 2 to 3 minutes after mixing. 

Fineness of division of baking powder. The fineness of division of 
a baking powder may affect the grain and texture of the baked product. 
With finely ground powders It seems reasonable to expect that the bubbles 
of carbon dioxide produced will be smaller than with coarser baking pow- 
ders, and that a finer grain will thus be produced In cakes and other 
products. Patterson refers to such a result with finely ground baking pow- 
ders. Sifting the baking powder with the flour aids In mixing the baking 
powder more uniformly throughout the batter or dough, and prevents loss 
of gas that would occur If the baking powder were mixed with the liquid. 

Brown spots are often produced on the crust of cookies, biscuits, cakes,

and other products when baking powder is used in them. If the baking 
powder used contains soda that is not finely ground, these spots are more 
likely to occur. The spots do not develop in the thin batters because of the 
large proportion of liquid, for solution of the soda is thus obtained. The 
brown spots appear in the product when the baking powder has been mixed 
only a short time with the dough. With longer mixing the soda is dis- 
solved and the spots do not appear. If doughs are allowed to stand before 
baking, the spots may not develop or a smaller number may form. Since 
cakes are usually mixed longer than biscuits and cookies, the spots develop 
more frequently in cakes when the baking powder is added after the mix- 
ing of the batter is partially completed. 

The Structure o£ Batters and Doughs 

The texture or structure of the finished product depends partly upon 
the structure obtained in the batter or dough when it is mixed. The role 
the flour plays in batter and dough products is the same as in bread, but 
since the batter or dough may contain different proportions of liquid and 
other ingredients the structure of the baked product is often unlike that 
of bread. 

The factors that affect the texture of the finished product may be 
grouped as follows: (1) the ingredients used, (2) the proportion of the 
ingredients used, (3) the kind and amount of baking powder used, (4) 
the extent of mixing, (5) the temperature of the ingredients when mixed, 
and (6) the method of mixing or combining ingredients. 

Doughs and batters may also be considered in relation to their ph^^sical 
properties. One of the physical properties of batters and doughs which is 
intimately connected with their structure, and which can be measured, is 
viscosity. Viscosity of batters and doughs is important enough to repeat the 
ten factors listed by Ostwald, causing variation in viscosity, which have 



MECHANICAL TREATMENT 457 

been previously mentioned in Chapter I. They are: (1) concentration, 
(2) temperature, (3) degree of dispersion, (4) solvation, (5) electrical 
charge, (6) previous thermal treatment, (7) previous mechanical treat- 
ment, (8) the presence or absence of other lyophilic colloids, (9) the age 
of the lyophilic sol, and (10) the presence of both electrolytes and non- 
electrolytes. 

The ingredients and their proportion. When factors (1) concentra- 
tion, (8) the presence or absence of other lyophilic colloids, and (10) the 
presence of both electrolytes and non-electrolytes, are combined, we have 
a formula or a recipe, in other w^ords the ingredients and their proportion 
or concentration. Batters and doughs consist of flour and a liquid. Usually 
some fat and egg are added, though one or the other may be omitted : fat 
is seldom used in popovers, and baking powder biscuits contain no egg. 
The proteins and starch of the flour are lyophilic systems. When eggs or 
milk are added their proteins add other lyophilic colloids. 

As the concentration or the quantity of the different ingredients in the 
batter is varied, its properties and characteristics vary, which in turn in- 
fluences the texture of the finished product. A batter with a high concentra- 
tion of liquid has a greater fluidity; one with a smaller proportion has a 
greater viscosity. As the proportion of each ingredient is varied, the finished 
product is altered accordingly, the kind and extent of the alteration depend- 
ing upon the particular quality imparted to the batter by the ingredient 
and upon the proportion of it used. 

The proportion of liquid used also influences the degree of solvation or 
hydration of certain constituents of the batter, i.e., the protein and starch. 

The presence of both electrolytes and non-electrolytes. Baking 
powder, salt, soda, and cream of tartar belong to the group of electrolytes. 
Salts affect the imbibition of water by gluten and coagulation by heat. 
Since baking powders contain different acid salts, it is possible that they 
may affect, in different degrees, the rate of hydration of the gluten and the 
total amount of water absorbed. 

Sugar belongs to the group of non-electrolytes. Its presence in large 
quantity in a batter affects the structure and also the extent of mechanical 
treatment needed to obtain a certain type of grain. 

Mechanical treatment. The extent of mixing a definite batter or 
dough may alter its viscosity or fluidity, and the texture of the finished 
product varies with this variation in viscosity. 

In the laboratory outline an effort is made to control the amount of 
mixing in most of the batter and dough series by counting the number 
of strokes used to stir the batter, particularly after the flour is added. It 
has been found that this gives more uniform results when mixing is done 
with a spoon or similar utensil, than to mix for a definite time. Some 
girls will use more than twice as many strokes in a stated time as others. 
To have the strokes more uniform they should all be made across the bowl 
or all used in a stirring motion. If a very large spoon or one with slots is 



458 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

used, it may be necessary to mix with a smaller number of strokes than the 
ones suggested. 

When it is possible a mechanical mixer with a definite speed is pref- 
erable to use for school work. Here, too, the amount of mixing required 
depends somewhat upon the size of the mixer and the quantity of ma- 
terial used. With large classes it is not always possible to have enough 
mixers not to delay the class work. Mixing with a spoon has the advantage 
of being the method used under most home conditions. 

There is an amount of mixing, which partially or completely dissolves 
the sugar, develops the gluten network sufficiently, and distributes the fat 
throughout the batter, that gives the best flavor and texture to the finished 
product. The product is tender and the volume is good. This amount of 
mixing, which may be called the optimum amount, will vary with each 
recipe, i.e., with the ingredients and their proportion. One illustration is 
the kind of flour used, for the optimum amount of mixing is not alwaj^s 
the same for bread and pastry flours. It will also vary with the temperature 
of the ingredients when they are mixed. 

The temperature of the ingredients when mixed. The tempera- 
ture of the ingredients when mixed influences the structure obtained, 
particularly in cakes and doughnuts. The protein particles of flour imbibe 
water more rapidly at higher temperatures. Sugar is more soluble with 
increasing temperature. But perhaps the consistency of the fat and its dis- 
tribution throughout the batter are most affected by temperature. If the 
temperature is low a fat is firmer, and less plastic. It spreads less readily 
throughout the other ingredients. The temperature of the other ingredients 
may be such that fat is rendered more or less plastic, i.e., they may be 
warmer or colder than the fat. In cake batters, if an oil is used the oil may 
be partially or wholly emulsified as an oil-in-water emulsion, the flour and 
egg proteins acting as the emulsifiers and surrounding the spheres of oil. 
If a fat is melted and added to a cake batter and the temperature of the 
ingredients is such that they do not harden the fat, a portion or all of the 
fat may be emulsified as an oil-in-water emulsion and the structure is 
similar to that produced by oil. This distribution of the oil in a batter 
as well as adsorption of fat and proteins at interfaces is probably influenced 
by the electrical charge. 

The method of mixing the ingredients. Bingham states, '*A pure 
liquid, at a given temperature and pressure, can have but a single fluidity, 
but in our study of liquid mixtures we have seen that a mixture of liquids 
may have an indefinite number of fluidities dependent upon the method 
of mixing, in other words, upon the structure of the liquid. Since colloidal 
solutions are always heterogeneous, they always possess structure, and 
therefore we have this variable always entering into our consideration, 
whereas heretofore we have given it but scant attention. There is, how- 
ever, every gradation from a pure liquid, to an incompletely mixed solu- 
tion, an emulsion, suspension or typical gel." 



ROLE OF INGREDIENTS IN BATTERS 459 

Methods of mixing and order of combination of ingredients have been 
important in many of the products that have been studied, i.e., gelatin, 
emulsions, milk, and egg cookery. The methods of mixing are particularly 
important in the batter and dough series. In some doughs, like pastry and 
biscuits, the fat is first blended with the flour, and the liquid is then 
added; in other instances the liquid ingredients are mixed and the flour 
added to them. Many different methods of mixing may be used w^ith cakes. 
They will be discussed in more detail later. 

A microscopic study of the distribution of the fat by different methods 
of mixing shows many gradations from the fat distributed in very thin 
films to that in thick layers. Sometimes the fat or oil is completely emulsi- 
fied, sometimes only partially. The sugar may be partially dissolved, **an 
incompletely mixed solution," or completely dissolved. One can see that 
it is not strange that cakes and other batter products are not always identi- 
cally alike with different bakings. Different methods of mixing may give 
different results, but from the previous discussion one concludes that a 
person cannot state definitely of a muffin, biscuit, or cake, that its texture 
is due to the method of mixing alone, for the extent of mixing, the tem- 
perature of the ingredients, interfacial reactions, and other factors in- 
fluence the texture obtained. 

The effect of extent of mixing on the flavor of dough and batter 
products. The statement that a cake from one-half of a batter after the 
ingredients are barely mixed does not have the same flavor as a cake baked 
from the other half of the batter after a longer mixing may seem strange 
at first. But with longer mixing the sugar is better dissolved, and the other 
ingredients better blended. To prevent repetition in the discussion of specific 
batter and dough products, flavor is seldom discussed. But from the stand- 
point of eating quality, flavor is of great importance, and on a score card 
the author would rate flavor higher than texture, appearance, or tender- 
ness. However, in the dough and batter series good flavor and good texture 
are closely related, i.e., if the texture is excellent the flavor is also usually 
rated high. Of course this is presuming that the ingredients used are of 
good quality and flavor, and that good proportions are used, i.e., too much 
salt is not added, etc. Unless otherwise stated, it is considered that the 
conditions that produce the best texture also give the best flavor. 

The role the various ingredients play in batter products. Liquid. 
The liquid is a solvent for sugar, soluble salts, and proteins. It is through 
solution in the liquid that the chemical reaction of baking powder is 
brought about with release of COo. The liquid hydrates the flour and egg 
proteins, giving the flour proteins cohesiveness and increasing the extensi- 
bility of proteins. Sugar in solution in the liquid comes in closer contact 
with proteins. The absorption and consequent swelling of starch granules 
gives them adhesiveness and cohesiveness and aids in forming the frame- 
work of baked products. 

Flour. Flour forms the framework, the backbone, or skeleton of baked 



460 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

products. This framework is more or less modified by the other ingre- 
dients. The gluten forms a continuous network, and the starch granules, 
which swell to a greater or less extent, depending on the proportion of 
liquid, become more or less adhesive and are embedded in the gluten net- 
work. 

Fat. Fat renders a product tender or short. It is not soluble but is 
adsorbed strongly on the surface of other constituents and forms films 
separating and lubricating them. In this way it is one of the major factors 
in producing a velvety, soft crumb in cake. Fat adds richness and tends to 
decrease the volume. If creamed it is a means of incorporating air, thus 
increasing the porosity. 

Sugar. Sugar adds flavor. In increasing amounts up to the optimum it 
tends to increase the volume and tenderness of the product to which it is 
added. Fat is strongly adsorbed by sugar crystals and is thus distributed 
throughout the batter. Sugar peptizes egg and possibly flour proteins, ele- 
vating the coagulation temperature of these proteins. In increasing amounts 
it delays solution of baking powder and other salts, so that carbon dioxide 
is produced more slowly. It is also possible that it may tend to absorb 
some of the carbon dioxide, thus lessening the amount lost during mixing. 
Because it is somewhat porous it may be a means of adding more air to 
the batter. 

Egg. Egg adds flavor and additional protein for the framework. If the 
yolk and white are not separated, the egg tends to decrease the volume 
and increase the elasticity and rubberiness. The lecithio-protein of the egg 
yolk has strong emulsifying properties and in batters emulsifies all or a 
major portion of the oil or melted fat. When the white is separated from 
the yolk it can be used as a means of incorporating air, thus increasing the 
volume and tenderness of the product. Well-beaten whole egg can also be 
used as a means of incorporating air, if added quickly to the batter before 
the air is lost. 

Baki7ig powder. Baking powder in optimum amounts increases the 
porosity of products and, by stretching the elastic protein, thinner cell 
walls, more tender products, and products of larger volume are obtained. 
It is possible that ions of salts of the baking powder or their residual salts 
may modify the hydration capacity of the flour proteins and some ions may 
tend to peptize some proteins. 

Popovers 

The amount of liquid used in popovers is large, and thus the hydration 
of the gluten particles is too great for them to adhere tenaciously to each 
other. Therefore, the popover batter may be beaten without increasing the 
compactness and without toughening the baked popovers to any appreciable 
extent. Egg is added to popovers. It is necessary to furnish additional, ex- 
tensible protein to hold the steam formed from the liquid and to coagulate 



CREAM PUFFS 461 

during baking to form the popover walls. If baked with no added egg, 
popovers do not increase in volume during baking and the texture is very 
soggy and compact. Except during the period of the year when the baking 
quality of the eggs is greatest, better popovers are often produced if the 
number of eggs in the recipe is increased to 3. If the eggs are not weighed 
and are small in size, better volume is always obtained by using 3 eggs. 

The popover batter may be put into hot or cold containers for baking. 
There seems to be little difference in the finished popovers, whichever way 
started. 

Popovers are probably best baked at rather high temperatures, 220° to 
240°C., to form steam rapidly. They need to be baked until they feel 
firm while still in the oven, for they soften after being taken from the 
oven, and unless they are quite firm will collapse. The heat may be turned 
off towards the last of the baking period to prevent excessive browning 
and the popovers left in the oven to become crisp, for the inside of the 
popover is hollow and because of the thin batter rather moist. 

Timbales and Cover Batters 

Timbales and rosettes should be crisp, and the timbale shell should be 
thick enough to hold the material that is to be served in it. Usually a cup 
of flour to a cup of liquid produces a good texture, but a slightly larger 
or smaller proportion of flour to the liquid also makes a good timbale. The 
batter should be mixed until free from lumps to avoid thickened places 
in the finished timbale. If bubbles are formed during mixing or beating of 
the batter they interfere with the smoothness of the finished timbale and 
it is therefore better to let the batter stand until these bubbles disappear. 

The timbale iron should be heated while the fat is heated in the deep 
fat kettle so that it will be the same temperature as the fat. If the timbale 
iron is too cold when it is dipped into the batter, the batter will not cling 
to it. The fat should be drained from the iron or the surplus wiped off with 
a paper towel before putting the iron in the batter. Otherwise the batter 
will not cling to the iron or large holes may be formed in the bottom of the 
timbale case from the surplus fat. 

Cream Puffs 

Cream puffs contain a higher percentage of fat and eggs than popovers, 
but the proportion of liquid to flour is the same in each. The fat, flour, 
and liquid are first cooked together until a stiff ball of dough is formed. 
They are sufficiently cooked when a metal spoon pressed down on the stiff 
mass leaves a sharp, clear, smooth imprint. Next the eggs are beaten into 
the batter. 

In the stiff batter produced by cooking the fat, flour, and water only a 
partial oil-in-water emulsion is formed. By staining the fat with Scarlet R 



462 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

its distribution in the batter can be determined by a microscope. Some of 
the fat is rather coarsely emulsified, and a good deal is found in layers and 
pools. Over-cooking of the fat, flour, and water increases the quantity of 
fat not emulsified. As the egg is added the fat becomes better emulsified, 
the dispersed spheres becoming smaller. The layers and pools of fat mostly 
disappear. The secret, and therefore the most important factor, in mixing 
cream puffs in order to obtain good expansion during baking and a good 
cavity is to beat the batter while adding the eggs until it is quite smooth, 
with no suggestions of small lumpy spots. Perhaps this is the reason why 
some directions for mixing cream puffs advise adding the unbeaten eggs one 
at a time. Incorporating the eggs one at a time at least insures thorough 
blending of the first eggs added. However, the eggs can be mixed with 
the batter as easily or more easily after they are beaten. When the puffs 
are made in large quantity, more than once the recipe, it is better to cool 
the paste slightly before the eggs are added because the large amount does 
not cool as rapidly as a smaller quantity. Some recipes state to cool the 
dough mixture before adding the eggs. On the whole, much better class 
results have been obtained by adding the eggs to the dough while it is 
warm. The probable explanation for this is that the surface tension is lower 
at the higher temperature and the emulsion forms more readily. 

If the proportion of water drops below a certain level the tendency for 
the fat to run from the dough while baking is increased. This may be due 
to the fat being more easily emulsified in the thinner batter. 

Sometimes the batter is very thin after the eggs are added, and it 
spreads and does not hold its shape on the baking sheet. When baked, the 
puff expands in one layer, giving a puff without a bottom or with a layer 
across the bottom that is too thin to hold a filling. This thin batter can 
sometimes be partially remedied by cooking and stirring over hot water 
in a double boiler until the batter is stiff enough to hold its shape when 
dropped on the baking sheet. The batter should be stiff enough to hold its 
shape, yet soft enough to appear glossy, and if forced through a pastry 
tube should retain the imprint of the tube teeth. The formation of the 
thin batter is not always due to under-cooking, for the flour, fat, and water 
may form a stiff ball. The fat is emulsified thoroughly enough to prevent 
its oozing out of the batter, but something happens that prevents the batter 
from becoming viscous. Usually, when the egg is first added the batter 
becomes somewhat thinner, but after being mixed the batter becomes in- 
creasingly viscous, until incorporation of the egg is complete, just as 
mayonnaise becomes stiffer as larger proportions of oil are emulsified. 

Steam is the leavening agent, and the expansion due to the steam pro- 
duces the cavity in the puff. Eggs are necessary, for their expansion and 
coagulation during cooking forms part of the framework of the baked puff. 
If the number of eggs is reduced and the amount of fat reduced at the 
same time a fair puff may be obtained. If the number of eggs is reduced the 
fat is not sufficiently emulsified and oozes from the puff as it bakes. As a 



GRIDDLE CAKES 463 

result the volume of the puff is poor. The fat may be omitted and the 
puffs are then similar to popovers. Cream-puff like popover batter can be 
beaten as much as desired without perceptibly toughening the finished prod- 
uct. The cooking of the flour with the water and fat coagulates a portion 
of the flour protein. The starch granules also swell as the flour is cooked 
with the liquid. 

The puffs like the popovers must be baked until very firm or they will 
collapse after removal from the oven. The best baking temperature is from 
220° to 240 °C. Cream puffs may be baked as well by starting in a cold 
oven as in a preheated oven, provided the oven heats quickly enough to 
reach a temperature of 220°C. in about 25 minutes. The batter may stand 
some time before baking provided it is left in a bowl and covered to pre- 
vent evaporation. 

Griddle Cakes 

Griddle cakes are made of wheat flour, or a combination of cereal flours, 
a liquid, salt, and a leavening agent. They may or may not contain egg, 
fat, and sugar. 

Griddle cakes are partially leavened by steam, but some baking powder 
is necessary. Both the proportion of flour and baking powder can be 
altered to secure a thin or a moist thick cake. For example, the consistency 
of the batter made by using 1 1/3 cups of flour to a cup of liquid can be 
changed by increasing the baking powder. As the quantity of powder is 
increased the batter becomes increasingly stiffer so that the griddle cakes 
are less moist, more porous and tender, and of greater volume. Adding 1^ 
to 2 teaspoons of powder to 1 1/3 cups of flour gives desirable cakes. This 
is a rather large amount of baking powder, but thin batters do not retain 
the gas as well as stiff ones, nor is air incorporated by creaming or by 
folding in beaten egg white. The kind of baking powder, i.e., one that 
reacts slowly or rapidly at room temperature, does not seem to affect the 
results, unless the batter has to stand for a long time before it is cooked. 
If this is necessary, a larger quantity of rapid-acting baking powder may 
be used. 

The greater the proportion of flour used to liquid, the less the batter 
should be beaten in order to have a tender cake. With the very stiff batters, 
the mixing should be continued only until the dry ingredients have barely 
disappeared. Over-mixing gives a soggy texture, which is apt to contain 
tunnels. The texture with over-mixing seems to be about the same regard- 
less of the type of baking powder used. 

If colored oil or melted fat is used in griddle cakes and waffles the 
distribution of the fat can be easily seen. It is dispersed in the uncooked 
batter as small spheres that are large enough to be seen without the aid 
of a microscope. With the concentration of fat used in these fairly thin 
batters, this dispersion occurs by stirring the melted fat or oil into the 



464 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

batter and is the same whether the fat Is added first or last. After cooking, 
a portion of the fat is found in pools or absorbed on the surface of the cell 
walls of the cooked product. 

If 2 or more tablespoons of oil or fat for each cup of liquid are added 
to the batter, the griddle cakes can be baked without greasing the griddle 
iron. This is an advantage, for it does away with the fumes of smoking 
fat while cooking the griddle cakes. Practically all iron skillets and frying 
pans can be used in this way. Much depends upon the heating of frying 
pan and griddle in preventing sticking of the batter. If they are too hot 
they stick as readily or more so than if they are not hot enough. Often they 
are not heated uniformly, being too hot in some portions and too cold in 
others. This is likely to happen when a large griddle is placed over a 
small flame. 

Waffles 

Waffles may contain the same ingredients as griddle cakes, though egg 
is never omitted as is sometimes the case in the latter. The proportion of 
flour may vary from 1 to 1^ cups or more per cup of liquid, depending 
on the type of waffle desired and the proportion of other ingredients. In 
general, waffles are preferable with less flour than is used in griddle cakes, 
1 1/3 cups to a cup of liquid being a good proportion for plain waffles. 
They also require less baking powder than griddle cakes. 

In mixing waffles the egg whites may be beaten stiff and folded into the 
batter or the whole egg may be beaten until foamy and added to the batter. 
The former method generally gives the better results. The stiffer the batter 
the shorter the mixing period should be, if tender w^affles are desired. 

One quality that many people desire in waffles is crispness. This depends 
largely on the length of time the waffle is baked. A plain waffle made from 
1 1/3 cups of flour needs to be baked about 4 to 5 minutes, though the 
exact time depends upon the temperature maintained by the iron and the 
depth of batter the iron will hold. However, a batter with a cup of flour 
to a cup of liquid needs to be baked longer, else the waffle is limp and 
soggy instead of crisp. Stiffer batters do not need to bake as long, but they 
are apt to give waffles that are somewhat bready and tough. 

The rich waffles, containing a high percentage of fat and some sugar or 
molasses, that are used for shortcakes or desserts, may be better if baked 
a little more slowly than plain waffles. Waffles containing a good deal of 
sugar are often limp when first taken from the iron, but if baked long 
enough, they become crisp in a short time. Those that are used for short- 
cake should be baked long enough to remain crisp. Melted fat or oil added 
to the batter does away with the necessity of greasing an electric waffle 
iron. However, if the electric iron is too hot or too cold the batter may 
stick to it.

Muffins 



The proportion of flour in muffins is usually 2 cups to a cup of liquid. 
For this reason, the extent of mixing has more effect on the structure of 
the batter and the finished muffins than in thin batters. The gluten with 
this proportion of liquid is more sticky and glue-like than in the thinner 
batters. It can be attenuated. Melted fat or an oil is distributed in an 
uncooked muffin batter in the same manner as in griddle cakes. 

Effect of extent of mixing on texture and appearance. With 
just enough mixing to barely blend the ingredients, 30 strokes or less, the 
batter breaks and separates easily when lifted with the spoon, is lumpy and 
not smooth in appearance. The top of the baked mufHn is rough, though 
it browns well and is a little shiny and has a glaze. The volume of the 
muffins is good, its cells rather large and uniform in size, and its cell 
walls of medium thickness. The muffin is tender. This amount of mixing, 
usually about 25 strokes, which can be partially determined by the ap- 
pearance of the batter, is the optimum amount of mixing. It is the amount 
that is required to just blend the dry flour with the liquid ingredients. 
See Figs. 46 to 48, muflfins number 1. 

When the mixing of the batter is continued beyond the optimum amount, 
the appearance of the batter gradually changes, becoming smoother and 
less lumpy. It flows more readily, and as it falls from the spoon it tends 
to cling to the spoon, forming long ribbon-like strands. The muffins also 
change in appearance, texture, and volume with longer mixing. See muffins 
2 and 3, Figs. 46 to 48. The top of the muflSn is less rounded and may 
come to a sharp point or peak. Its crust is smoother, browns less readily, 
and becomes duller in appearance with less glaze. Up through the center 
of the muffin are found long holes, which are called tunnels, that end 
just below the point at the top. Large holes are often found in muffins and 
cakes, caused by addition of air in mixing, but tunnels are long and rather 
narrow. When tunnels develop the muffins are less tender. The grain of 
the muffin becomes finer with longer mixing, the cell walls thinner, the 
tunnels more numerous, and the muffin is more compact. With extremely 
long mixing, and particularly with phosphate or tartrate baking powders, 
the texture of the muffin may be very soggy, the volume small, with few 
tunnels, the top flat and very smooth in appearance. See muffins 4, Figs. 
46 to 48. 

Tunnels. Tunnels usually start at the bottom of the muffin and con- 
verge near the center at the top. They are formed from expansion of 
gas in the dough. Part of this gas is from steam, for if one watches the 
baking of muffins through a glass oven door, occasional small jets of steam 
may be seen to escape from muffins that have been stirred sufficiently so 
that tunnels develop. With thin batters like popovers, or doughs like baking 
powder biscuits, tunnels do not develop. When the batter contains the

as shown in Fig. 50 at A. The gluten strands of the batter are stretched 
toward the point in contact with the spoon. The manner or direction in 
which the tunnels form is partially dependent upon the way in which 
the gluten strands are stretched in mixing and in placing the batter in the 



470 



BATTERS AND DOUGHS 



pans. In the baked muffins the tunnels may form as shown in the cross- 
section diagram at B. When the batter from the end of the spoon falls 
near the edge of the muffin pan the tunnels may converge as shown in C, 
Fig. 50. 

Two other factors that influence the formation of tunnels, though their 
effect is not always consistent, are depth of the batter and the baking 
temperature. When the batter is mixed just to the verge of tunnel forma- 
tion, the deeper the batter in the pan the mort apt are tunnels to appear. 
The effect of temperature is still more variable than some of the other 
factors, but tunnels have been observed in portions of a batter baked at 
higher temperatures, when other portions baked at lower temperatures did 
not have them or they were less numerous.

is well developed, being dropped from a spoon into a muffin pan. 

B. Direction of tunnels in baked muffin. 

C. Direction of tunnels when the point of dough falls to one side of the pan. 

Varying the proportion of ingredients in muffins. Too large a 
proportion of flour or too little liquid increases the tendency to form tunnels, 
even with a small amount of mixing. If sugar and fat are increased the 
gluten develops less readily, but the effect is not very great. The omission 
of egg does not change the muffin structure to a very great extent, although 
there is less tendency for tunnels to form. The flavor of course is different 
if the batter contains no egg. Increasing the egg tends to give a tougher, 
more rubbery, elastic muffin. Egg not beaten sufficiently to blend easily 
with other ingredients or not mixed sufficiently with the liquid may produce 
a rather waxy texture with fairly thick cell walls. This texture is often 
seen in muffins which are not over-mixed. 

Baking powder. The electrolyte baking powder influences the viscosity 
and tenacity of the batter. When a muffin batter that contains no baking 
powder is just mixed, it separates from the spoon without forming strands 
and may be described as short. With longer mixing the batter becomes 
smoother, but there is not as definite a change as when the baking powder 
is in the batter during mixing. If the baking powder is in the batter during 
all the mixing period the batter is short when just mixed, but after the 



BISCUITS 471 

baking powder has dissolved, the batter seems more tenacious, and compact 
with longer mixing. That the volume is less is readily seen by the weight, 
for 60 grams of the batter is greatest after just mixing and becomes less 
with longer mixing. This is more noticeable with the phosphate or tartrate 
baking powders than with the sulfate-phosphate ones. 

Fig. 49 shows muffins that have been stirred 85 strokes. Then the baking 
powder was added and stirred an additional 15 strokes. The knob-like 
protuberances are characteristic of muffin batter that has been mixed too 
long. The tartrate and phosphate powders, probably because of their more 
rapid action at room temperature, are less likely to develop these knobs. 
However, the sulfate-phosphate powders with over-mixing are more likely 
to develop these knobs, for less carbon dioxide is lost during mixing, hence 
more pressure is exerted during the baking. 

The amount of mixing required for the best texture in muffins, with the 
different types of baking powders, is about the same, for the batter can be 
mixed only about 25 strokes or a little more with either a rapid- or a slow- 
acting powder. 

All the muffins in the illustrations contained the same weight of batter, 
and were baked in pans of the same size. Thus the effect of mixing on 
the volume is shown by the comparative size of the picture. 

Baking temperatures for muffins. A temperature of 195° to 210°C. 
is good to use for muffins. A very high temperature sets the crust before 
the batter has time to rise ; a very low temperature requires a long time to 
brown and cook the muffins. 

Greasing the sides of the muffin pans lightly or not at all aids expansion 
of the dough in baking, as the dough can cling more tenaciously to the 
sides of the tin; but greasing the bottom of the pan heavily expedites the 
removal of the muffins from the tin. 

Standing before baking. All muffins and nut breads made with 
baking powder, but particularly those made with rapid-acting powders, 
should be mixed quickly and put into the muffin tins as quickly as possible 
after mixing. This lessens the amount of gas lost. They can stand in the 
muffin tins for some time before baking, because the dough is stiff and 
viscous and, if not cut across or through, most of the gas is retained. 

The palatability of bran muffins can be improved by soaking the bran 
in warm milk before the flour and other ingredients are added, or the 
muffins may be allowed to stand for some time after mixing and before 
baking so that the cellulose of the bran becomes better hydrated and thus 
softer. 

Biscuits 

The using of the proportion of liquid required by the flour is one im- 
portant factor in obtaining a desirable texture in biscuits. Since hydration 
capacity of different flours varies, it is necessary to determine this for the 



472 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

various brands and grades of flour. The same brand of flour in different 
sections of the United States is not always from the same kind of wheat. 
For example, Gold Medal flour in Iowa is an all-purpose flour, but in 
Alabama or Mississippi it is made from soft wheat, the type used exten- 
sively in the southern states. 

Method o£ combining ingredients for biscuits. In biscuits, a 
different method of mixing is used from those heretofore considered in the 
batter and dough series. Oil may be used. Fats are not melted, and either 
oil or fat is added directly to the flour. If a colored fat is used it can be 
readily seen that the fat is distributed in layers or pools and absorbed on 
the surface of the starch granules. In this dough, with its small proportion 
of liquid and no egg, there seems to be little tendency for the fat to form 
an oil-in-water emulsion. 

Fat is added to biscuits to give shortness. It is important in making 
good biscuits to mix the fat and flour suflficiently, but not too much. Using 
a fine, wired fat mixer, or rubbing lightly between the finger tips, is the 
easiest and quickest way of mixing the fat with the flour. Some cooks 
prefer to pick up a portion of the fat and flour, letting it fall gradually 
back into the bowl while mixing it. In this way the mixture may remain 
more light and fluffy, because more air is retained. In adding the liquid to 
the mixture of fat and flour, a two- or three-tined fork is preferable to a 
spoon, for the dough is packed less during the mixing. Usually about 25 
to 35 strokes are needed to combine the liquid and flour. With longer 
stirring of the dough the biscuits stand up better and the texture is less 
coarse. The texture of rolled biscuits is improved by folding over and 
rolling out about 4 times, which gives a very flaky texture, or by knead- 
ing a short time in addition to the stirring. For kneaded biscuits the dough 
is removed to a bread board and kneaded very lightly 10 to 20 times. 
Kneading tends to develop sheets or layers with a fine texture, which is 
considered desirable. Excess kneading toughens the dough more rapidly 
than stirring with a fork. If the proportion of fat used is large, or if a 
pastry flour is used, the mixing and kneading can be continued for a 
slightly longer time. The crust of biscuits is less crisp with longer mixing 
or when they are kneaded. Those who prefer a very crisp crust may like 
dropped biscuits better than kneaded ones. See Experiment 83. 

Beaten biscuit. The beaten biscuit of the South is made without the 
addition of baking powder or soda. While the dough is beaten, it is folded 
over and over so that it contains air. Since the beating is prolonged the 
gluten may be modified or softened and becomes more tender. This is simi- 
lar to the long mixing used by Swanson in modifying the gluten of bread. 
The amount of beating to give the best texture is indicated by a Negro 
mammy when she says, "I use 300 strokes for every day, but when I'se 
spectin' company in, I use 500 sure." 

Soft-wheat flour and biscuit. The addition of calcium acid phosphate 
to soft-wheat flours improves their quality for biscuit. Alexander states 
that, *'It is almost impossible to sell flours in some districts in the South 



PANS AND PREPARATION FOR BAKING 473 

unless the sack is marked 'Phosphate added.' " The acid calcium phosphate 
is acid in reaction. It has a pH of about 4.0. Alexander states, *'We know 
that the gluten proteins tend to imbibe water, and disperse in a weakly 
alkaline medium, so that a slightly alkaline dough is sticky. Excess alkali 
in dough produces a yellow color and a soapy taste." 

Alexander reports that dough quality, biscuit volume, crumb, texture, 
and color are improved by treating soft-wheat flour with 0.5 per cent 
calcium acid phosphate. Logue and Ranker have reported results similar 
to those of Alexander. 

Smith and Bailey have reported **The Effect of Chemical Leavening 
Agents on the Properties of Bread." Their conclusions, in part, for the 
biscuits and their experimental work follow. "Gluten properties, including 
elasticity and hydration capacity, are affected by baking powder, and by 
the residual salts resulting from the chemical reaction of baking powder 
ingredients. 

''Disodium phosphate, the residual salt resulting from the reaction of 
monosodium phosphate baking powder, afifects gluten more than the resi- 
dues from other types of baking powders." 

Cakes 

Cake recipes are legion in number, but the underlying principles for 
making cakes containing a fat are similar, though some variation must be 
made for different recipes, depending upon the particular ingredients and 
their proportion. 

Cakes containing fat may be divided into two classes. First, the pound 
cake type, based on the old recipe, which is one pound each of butter, sugar, 
eggs, and flour, and in which no baking powder or soda is used, the light- 
ness of the cake depending upon the expansion of moisture from the eggs 
and butter and the air incorporated in creaming and in the beaten eggs. 
Second, the cup or layer cake types that contain rather small percentages 
of fat and sugar, in which the lightness depends largely upon added baking 
powder. Between these rich and lean type formulas are many transitions. 

One desirable quality in cake is a certain texture, often called velveti- 
ness. Velvetiness implies softness to the touch, but to obtain this softness it 
is necessary to have a definite amount of moisture, else the texture is too 
dry or too soggy. However, the proportion of liquid is not the only factor 
in developing velvetiness ; the proportion of other ingredients and how they 
are handled are also important. A good cake should have a fine, even grain, 
with thin cell walls, and should not be powdery or crumbly. It should 
have a good flavor. 

Pans and preparation for baking. The cake tends to expand to a 
better volume if the sides of the cake pans are not greased. But a piece of 
wax or other suitable paper, cut to fit the bottom of the pan and greased 
on the side next to the batter, facilitates removal of the cake from the pan. 

The depth of batter in the pan also influences the texture of the cake, 



474 



BATTERS AND DOUGHS 



so that if a finer, more velvety texture is desired, the size of the pan should 
be such that the batter is at least 1 inch or lyi inches in depth. 

Another factor affecting the texture of the cake, and more than might 
be expected, is the slope of the sides of the pans, straighter sides resulting 
in better textures. 

Baking cakes. Temperatures for bakings. Cakes containing fat are 
baked over a wide range of temperature, from below 100° to over 210°

being used. For instance, fruit cake may be steamed at 100' 



baked in 



the oven from below 100°C. to over 175°C. 

No very definite information was available as to what temperatures 
were preferable for baking cakes when using one of the three common 
types of baking powder. Theoretically, it seemed possible that a powder 
that released its gas rapidly at room temperature should be baked at a higher 
temperature than a powder that gave off its gas more slowly. Stone investi- 
gated the effect of varying the baking temperature on the volume and 
scores for plain cake. She used Formula I, with flour reduced to 284 grams 
and the amount of baking powder found to be optimum by McLean, or 



BAKING CAKES

8, 10, and 12 grams of sulfate-phosphate (combination), tartrate, and 
phosphate, respectively. The cakes for any one series were always mixed 
together and the batter divided into five equal parts by weight. Hence, any 
variation in the volume, texture, velvetiness, and eating quality for a set 
of five cakes was caused by the baking temperature. The time of baking 
was necessarily shorter as the oven temperature increased. The cakes were

baked in loaf pans, one-fourth the recipe being used for each cake. The 
volume was determined by seed displacement. The effect of baking tempera- 
ture on cake volume is shown in Fig. 51. For the particular formula and 
amount of baking powder used the optimum baking temperature for all 
three types of baking powder was 185°C. (365°F.). 

The total scores, which were the sum of scores for texture, tenderness, 
velvetiness, and eating quality, were affected by the baking temperature. 
These results are shown in Fig. 52. 

The texture and velvetiness of the cakes varied with the different baking 
temperatures. Heat penetration of the cake batter is of course slower at 
the lower temperatures. The cakes baked at the lower temperature had 
thicker cell walls, coarser, more harsh, less velvety texture, and were alto- 



476 



BATTERS AND DOUGHS 



gether less desirable. The small volume and poor texture at the lower 
temperature are undoubtedly caused by the cake batter's not coagulating 
quickly enough in relation to the rate of gas formation. In other words, 
as the gas formed the temperature was not high enough to coagulate the

egg and flour proteins, with the result that more than the optimum amount 
of gas escaped and more than the optimum amount of agitation occurred 
within the cake before coagulation started. For, as gas is produced its 
expansion agitates to a greater or less degree the cake batter. And if this 
agitation is continued too long before the crumb is coagulated, coarse 
textures result. With increase in the baking temperature the eating quality 
improved, the texture became finer and softer, the volume greater. Above

although the texture was still velvety. 

Sugar content and baking temperature. It is known that sugar is a good 
peptizer of egg proteins and elevates the coagulation temperature of egg 
proteins. It is also possible that sugar may affect the coagulation tempera- 
ture of the flour proteins. From a few isolated observations some evidence 
has accumulated indicating that the higher the sugar content the higher 
the baking temperature should be for cake. But the work has not progressed 
far enough at present to draw definite conclusions.

Fig. 54. — The effect of baking temperature upon scores of a rich (Recipe A) and 
a less rich (Recipe B) chocolate cake. (Rogosheski and Bernds) 

Baking temperatures for chocolate cake. Rogosheski and Bernds used 
two chocolate cake recipes, one a very rich cake {A), the formula for 
which is given in the laboratory outline, Experiment 85A. The other recipe 
{B) was identically like Recipe A except one-fourth cup less of butter and 
of sugar were used. The batter for one series of cakes was divided, 250 
grams being weighed into each pan. 

The effect of baking temperature upon cake volume is shown in Fig. 53, 
the richer cake giving a smaller volume than Recipe B. But for both recipes 
the volume increased with higher baking temperatures. The relation of 
baking temperatures to total scores is shown in Fig. 54. 

The results should be taken as suggestive rather than final, for only 
small loaf cakes were used. But since the texture and eating quality im- 
prove and the velvetiness of the crumb increases progressively with increase 



478 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

of oven temperature up to 205 °C., it suggests that there has been too 
much tendency to sacrifice texture for the appearance and shape of the top 
of the cake. 

The shape of the top and the way the cake shrinks from the sides of the 
pan are characteristic for each temperature. During the last of the baking 
period and cooling, the cake baked at the lowest temperature shrinks the 
most, both in height and from the sides of the pan. As the oven tempera- 
ture is elevated, the shrinking progressively decreases, until none occurs in 
cakes baked at 195° C. 

At the lowest temperature the top of the cake was level or had a slight 
depression in the center. As the baking temperature increased the top 
became rounded until at the highest temperature the top punched up in the 
middle entirely too much for a good appearance. There was a tendency for 
the cakes baked at 205° and particularly at 215° to become too brown on 
the edges. If these factors as well as eating quality are taken into con- 
sideration, the preferable baking temperature for these formulas appears to 
be from 195° to 205°C. (Approximately 385° to 400°F.) 

Schaal suggests that for bakers' chocolate cakes 380°F. is a good baking 
temperature. He says, "Bake the goods until they are just barely done. 
It is a mistake to overbake, since overbaking impairs the flavor just as 
much as a flashy oven, or an oven at too high a temperature." 

The oven temperature at start of baking. Peet and Lowe baked plain 
cake (Formula I) from a cold and preheated start in three electric, two 
gas, and one kerosene range. The twelve cakes were mixed at one time on 
an Institutional Hobart mixer. Equal amounts of batter were weighed 
into the 8-inch square pans immediately after mixing. One-half the recipe 
was used for each cake. The batter baked in the preheated ovens stood in 
the pans while that started in the cold ovens was baking. Since a sulfate- 
phosphate baking powder was used, it was thought the standing w^as less 
serious for the tests than to use different mixes. The ovens were all set to 
maintain a temperature of 185°C., once this temperature was reached. 

The cakes started in the preheated ovens were superior in texture, velveti- 
ness, and eating quality to those started in cold ovens. In scoring the cakes 
the judges found no significant differences in cakes baked in different 
ranges. 

The volumes of cakes baked in different ranges varied, the differences 
being highly significant. But there was no significant variation in the vol- 
ume of cakes baked in the same range from a cold and a preheated start. 

The texture of the cakes baked from a cold start resembled that of cakes 
baked at lower temperatures in Stone's study. 

Temperature for removing cake from the pan. Cakes containing fat have 
not been given much care in cooling, but Glabau has reported that the 
cake should not be removed from the pan nor handled until the interior 
temperature of the cake has reached 140°F. This time varies somewhat 
with the thickness of the cake and the room temperature but is about 15 
minutes or longer. When cakes are first removed from the oven the struc- 



INGREDIENTS USED IN CAKES 479 

ture is fragile. With cooling the critical time for handling passes and the 
cake becomes sufficiently rigid to withstand the shock of handling. 

Ingredients used in cakes. Flour. In general, soft-wheat flours give 
better results than bread flour in cakes. Very tender cakes and cakes of 
excellent texture are obtained by using specially prepared cake flours. All- 
purpose flours give good results in the plain cake recipe of the laboratory 
outline. In the cake recipes in the laboratory outline only 100 grams of 
all-purpose flour are used for a cup. The smaller weight of flour per cup 
reduces the total gluten in the cake. Sometimes about 2 tablespoons of 
cornstarch are substituted for 2 tablespoons of flour in a cup of bread flour. 
This also lessens the percentage of gluten and the gluten strength of the 
flour, but too much cornstarch is likely to produce too dry and too powdery 
a crumb, and the cake does not keep so well; nor does adding cornstarch 
render the granule size fine and uniform. 

Patterson emphasizes the importance of uniform grinding of the flour 
used for cake, so that the particles are as nearly of the same size as possi- 
ble. He thinks the uniformity of the particles of flour aids in attaining 
uniform cells in the cake. He states that in an ideal cake the gas cells should 
expand to about 1/16 of an inch in diameter, and at this point they should 
rupture slightly, allowing the gas to escape. He also emphasizes the im- 
portance of gluten development on the structure of the cake. 

Fat. Butter is preferable in cakes because of its flavor, the rich, full- 
flavored, but not rancid, being better than the mild. Oils and melted fats 
can be used in cakes, but the texture is not as good as when fats that can 
be creamed are used. Creaming is forming a foam by incorporating air 
bubbles in a fat by stirring. Creaming fat is somewhat similar to beating 
eggs or egg whites, in that the enclosed air later aids in leavening. Air is 
enclosed in the fat more rapidly after some sugar is added, hence creaming 
is usually done by adding the sugar to the fat, either gradually during the 
creaming process, or all at one time. The sugar adsorbs a portion of the 
fat on its surface and is suspended in the fat. If, as suggested in the chap- 
ter on meats, adsorption of fat at an interface renders it softer and more 
plastic than when not adsorbed at the same temperature, a suggestion is 
given for better creaming after the sugar is added. In addition the sugar 
crystals aid in supporting the fat in the walls around the air bubbles in 
much the same manner as the fat globules in whipped cream. See Fig. 31. 
For a fat to cream or form a foam it must have some body, for if it is too 
warm so that it is partially or entirely melted it does not cream. On the 
other hand, a fat that is hard and brittle and not plastic does not cream 
well. The hard fats like tallow with high melting points are not desirable in 
cakes. They do not cream well and on account of their hardness after the 
cake has cooled, they impart a firm, crumbly texture. 

Minard and Myers both found that the texture of the fat is important 
in relation to creaming quality and in obtaining velvety texture in cakes. 
By the rate of cooling a fat after it is melted, its texture can be controlled 
so that it is very waxy and firm, soft and smooth, or granular with a lot of 



480 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

separated oil. Minard found the very firm, waxy lard did not cream well. 
Myers found a soft, smooth lard creamed best, butter ranked second, and 
grainy or granular lard was poorest. 

Since any fat tends to become harder at low temperatures and softer 
at higher temperatures, there is a range at which each fat creams best. 
Martin used hydrogenated lard, Crisco, 44 lards of varying softness and 
firmness, and butter. The initial temperature of all the fats at start of 
creaming was 24° to 25 °C. All creamed fairly well at this temperature, 
though in general they tended to cream better at higher temperatures. In 
general the volume was decreasingly smaller in the order named. A low 
initial room temperature retarded creaming. Creaming tends to elevate 
the temperature of the creaming mass, probably from friction, though the 
butter usually shows an initial drop in temperature. For optimum creaming 
the firmer fats require a higher temperature than 25 °C. The hydrogenated 
lard creams well at 30°C. or above this temperature, creaming the best of 
any fat tried on hot days. Optimum creaming temperatures for fats com- 
monly used are 24° to 29°C. (about 75° to 85°F.). In the studies of fats 
in relation to their use in cake at Iowa State College a highly significant 
correlation between the volume of the creamed mixture and their tempera- 
ture has been obtained, which indicates the volume of the creamed mixture 
is related to its temperature, as expected. 

Butter varies in creaming ability. Bakers usually report that it gives 
a poor creaming volume. Jenkins used three winter butters with Crisco as 
a control. She used Formula I with 8.4 grams of a tartrate baking powder 
for the full recipe. The butters were prepared in January by the Dairy 
Department. The same batch of cream was used for the three butters, but 
portions were churned when the serum acidity was 0.2, 0.4, and 0.6 per 
cent. This gave butters with acid numbers of 1.20, 1.40, and 1.70, re- 
spectively. The acid number of the Crisco was 0.10. The creaming volume 
was least from the butter of intermediate acidity, greatest from the most 
acid butter, and the other two fats gave practically the same volume. It is 
rather interesting that, regardless of creaming volume, the final volume of 
all the cakes increased with an increase in temperature of mixing. The final 
average volumes of the cakes were very similar. But the fat giving the 
greatest creaming volume does not seem always to yield the greatest cake 
volume. The temperature of the ingredients when mixed had more effect on 
the final volume than did the creamed volume of the fat. No indication of 
the effect of variation in composition of butter on creaming volume was 
obtained. The composition of butter varies with the season of the year and 
with the locality in which it is produced. Graham using summer butters 
obtained results that were very similar to those of Jenkins, but the cakes 
had smaller volumes. It may seem rather strange that there is no close cor- 
relation between the volume of the creamed mixture and the volume of the 
cake. But studies tend to show this. Both Martin and Buel obtained non- 
significant correlations between these two factors. Martin obtained a nega- 
tive correlation which, although not significant, tended to show that, for 



METHODS OF MIXING CAKES 481 

4 fats out of 5, smaller cake volumes were obtained with larger creaming 
volumes. Minard obtained significant, negative correlation for these two 
factors showing that in her studies cake volume was smaller when the 
creamed volume was large. The fats studied in these investigations have 
included several types of lard, butter, hydrogenated lard, and Crisco, though 
the studies with the last fat were not extensive. From her results, Martin 
suggested that there may be for each fat a point short of maximum cream- 
ing volume, at which the creaming process should be stopped in order to 
produce a cake of maximum volume. 

But what Martin calls creaming quality is important and is closely re- 
lated to velvety texture and high scores for cakes. By a good creaming 
quality is meant that a soft, spongy, not too frothy, not a granular, lumpy, 
or pasty texture is obtained. In other words, there is a particular body and 
texture in the creamed mass rather difficult to describe that is related to 
excellent textures in cake. 

Sugar. Granulated sugar is most commonly used. Finely granulated 
sugars dissolve more readily than coarse ones. Minton states that, the finer 
the granulation size, provided it is a natural granulation obtained in the 
refinery and not a powdered or crushed sugar, the better the creaming 
quality. The Bakery Research Department of Procter & Gamble Company 
also state that the fine crystal that has a glossy surface, and is not made 
by grinding or crushing, gives better creaming volume than the coarse 
sugars. Brown sugar, because of its flavor, is often used in cake. It is pref- 
erable to substitute it by weight rather than by measure. 

The transformed sugar, with its irregular surface which holds much air, 
should not only carry air into the batter, but many films of fat. 

Liquid. Water or fruit juices may be used for the liquid in cake. When 
water is substituted for an equal weight of milk, a more moist cake is 
obtained. Milk contains about 12 to 13 per cent solids. 

Baking powder. Patterson states that unless the cake cells are very fine 
and uniform a very fine baking powder should be used, so that small bub- 
bles are formed. With many large bubbles of gas formed at the same time, 
the cell walls may be subjected to too great a pressure and collapse, pro- 
ducing a fallen cake. 

Any of the different types of baking powder can be used in cakes. The 
main discussion of the use of baking powder in cake is given later in the 
chapter under "Variation of Proportion of Ingredients." 

Eggs. Eggs vary so in size that they should be weighed for experimental 
work. As previously stated, eggs beat up more quickly and to a better 
volume if they are not too cold, so that it is preferable to have them room 
rather than refrigerator temperature. 

Methods o£ mixing cakes. There are many methods by which cakes 
may be mixed. Some old cake recipe directions state to mix the fat with 
the flour. The sugar is next added and lastly the eggs and milk. This 
old method may give very good cake. In all the batter and dough products 
that have thus far been considered, with the exception of cream puffs, the 



482 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

proportion of fat is usually smaller than in cakes. The method of mixing 
cream puffs is to melt the fat. It is also a common practise, except for 
biscuit, to melt the fat for the other dough and batter products. These 
same methods of mixing are used for cakes, but a new method is introduced, 
one in which a foam is formed with the fat. Certain procedures of mixing 
are designated by various names, but each of these methods may have many 
variations. 

Conventional method. By the conventional method the fat and sugar are 
creamed until the mixture becomes lighter in color, spongy and fluffy in 
texture. Fig. 55 is a photomicrograph of creamed butter and sugar. The 
irregular, large, and intermediate-sized spheres are sugar crystals with an 
adsorbed layer of fat. It was difficult at first to decide whether the smaller 
rounded crystals were air bubbles or sugar. This was determined, as is often 
the case in experimental work, by accident. In using a microprojector to 
show slides made from colored creamed fats to a class the heat filter was 
forgotten. After a few seconds the heat from the light used in the projector 
melted the fat on the slide. One could watch the air bubbles burst on the 
screen. The remaining particles after the fat w^as melted were sugar crys- 
tals. Many of the air bubbles show in the picture as small, white circles with 
a very light gray line around them, and are hardly discernible at this mag- 
nification. This strong adsorption of the fat at the surface of sugar crystals 
and at the interface of air bubbles and a liquid is typical and is one means 
of distributing the fat throughout the batter. 

It seems to make little difference in the final product if the fat is stirred 
for a short period and the sugar is then added gradually, or whether the 
sugar and fat are combined and then creamed, but air is incorporated more 
rapidly after the sugar is added. However, creaming by hand is easier and 
more rapid if the sugar is added graduallv because the mixture is not so 
stiff. 

In the conventional method the whole egg is creamed with the sugar and 
fat or only the yolk is incorporated during creaming and the beaten w^hite 
is added to the batter. Not as much air can be introduced into the creamed 
mass if only the yolk is used, but this is compensated for in the cake vol- 
ume by the air incorporated in the beaten white. Under some conditions 
there may be advantages in adding the beaten egg white last. Just as good 
texture is produced if the beaten white is stirred rapidly into the batter 
as when folded. The texture is also good if the beaten white is added and 
stirred in with the flour and milk. Considering time, effort, and the cake 
texture, there is often no advantage in separating the whites and yolks of the 
egg for plain cake. 

Fig. 56 is a photomicrograph of the creamed butter-sugar-egg batter 
after the egg has been added. Since more of the sugar goes into solution 
the sugar crystals become smaller after the egg is added. Many of the 
sugar crystals are larger than those shown in this particular field, as will be 
noticed when the photomicrograph of the batter is observed.

METHODS OF MIXING CAKES 485 

minutes, and the creaming is continued for a total of 20 minutes with a 
mixer. They state that if the eggs are added after the butter and sugar are 
thoroughly creamed there is a tendency to break down the creamed mass. 

The flour and milk may be added to the creamed mixture as follows: 
(1) all added at one time, (2) flour added first and last, (3) milk added 
first and last, and (4) part of the flour and part of the milk added at the 
same time. Often the statement is given in directions for mixing cakes that 
a portion of flour should be added first and last to the creamed mixture, 
as the liquid tends to cause separation of the creamed mass. On the other 
hand, the Bakery Research Department of Procter & Gamble give for the 
method of mixing after the fat, sugar, and egg have been creamed, "to 
add two-thirds of the milk and mix it with just a few turns of the beater. 
Then the dry ingredients may be added and mixed in, using low speed. 
After the mixture is quite smooth, add the remainder of the milk slowly 
and continue the mixing until the dough is thoroughly mixed and very 
uniform." Judged from laboratory results, the first method is less likely 
to give an excellent texture, but all the others may give very fine even 
grain and velvety texture. Adding milk first and last is the quickest and 
easiest method. 

Fig. 58 is a photomicrograph of the creamed butter-sugar-egg mixture 
shown in Figs. 55 and 56 after the flour and milk are added. All the photo- 
micrographs are from the recipe in which 1^ cups of sugar were used. 
The flour and milk were added alternately in thirds, and a total of 225 
strokes was used for mixing. In this picture the sugar crystals are shown 
with an adsorbed layer of fat. In the background are the starch granules 
of the flour and some very thin films of fat that do not show very well with 
this magnification. The sugar crystals have a tendency to form in clusters. 
Fig. 57 shows the cake made by this method. The cakes shown in Figs. 57, 
63, and 64 were baked in larger pans than the cakes shown in other illus- 
trations and so cannot be compared on the basis of size. All the ingredients 
for these cakes were room temperature when mixed. Fig. 59 shows a con- 
trast in creaming to Figs. 55, 56, and 58. The sugar and butter were 
stirred 10 strokes with a wooden spoon. Then the slightly beaten egg was 
added and stirred 7 strokes. The flour and milk, Fig. 60, were added in the 
same manner as for Fig. 58. Fig. 63 shows the cake made from the 
partially creamed mixture. 

Muffin method. By this method the beaten egg, the melted fat, and 
liquid are combined. All the dry ingredients are combined and added to the 
liquid ones. The advantage of this method is that the batter can be mixed 
in a short time. If the milk, eggs, and flour are not cool enough to partially 
solidify the fat, an oil-in-water emulsion is formed of part or all of the 
fat, and the texture of the cake is not as velvety, nor is it as tender, as by 
some other methods of mixing. When an oil-in-water emulsion forms in a 
batter, the batter remains smooth and does not contain flecks or small curds. 

Cake-mixer method. This method has several different names, and as in

are stirred until thoroughly creamed, spongy, and fluffy. When the beaten 
egg is added to the fat and sugar at tjie beginning of the creaming process 
a rotary egg beater may be used until the mass becomes too stiff to turn 
the beater easily, when a spoon can be substituted. After the fat, sugar, 
and egg have been stirred they sometimes separate into fine flecks or curds. 
The flour and milk are added to the above mixture. Sometimes, after the 
flour and milk are added to the other ingredients, the flecks or curds may 
continue or may develop later in the batter. They also usually develop 
with the conventional method of mixing, and at least in some recipes there 
is nothing detrimental in their formation. In fact, the presence of very fine 
flecks seems to give assurance of a good texture in some recipes. If the 
flecks or curds are very large the texture of the cake is not as good as when 
they are smaller. 

James, using Formula I, found that cakes scored higher when the fat, 
sugar, and eggs were thoroughly creamed than when only partially creamed. 

A variation of the cake-mixer method is to put everything in the 
mixing bowl at once and then combine the ingredients. The texture of the 
cake thus obtained for any given recipe depends largely upon the tempera- 
ture of the ingredients when combined. If all the ingredients are at the 
optimum or ideal temperature for combining, excellent textures may be 
obtained. Longer mixing is also required than is usual after the flour is 
added, if the butter and sugar have not been thoroughly creamed. 

Emulsion method. This method of mixing cake is one evolved in the 
author's laboratory. If an oil-in-water emulsion is desired in a cake batter, 
why not mix the batter by a method that will give the most stable emul- 
sion? The oil or melted fat is added gradually to the beaten egg exactly 
as in making mayonnaise. The sugar is added to the emulsion and next 
the flour and milk. This method of mixing is a poor one for making cake. 
The cake is more rubbery and tough when mixed by this method. This is 
logical, for the fat being dispersed in spheres has proportionally less surface 
area, and being surrounded by the emulsifying agents, the egg and flour, 
has less shortening power and hence the cake is more elastic and tough. 
For the same reason the fat is not as evident to the taste as when the 
cake is mixed by the conventional or cake-mixer methods. If the emulsion 
breaks, as it often does with the proportion of fat and eggs used in cakes, 
the texture of the cake is better than if it had not broken. If the tempera- 
ture of the ingredients is such that the fat does not remain melted, the 
oil-in-water emulsion is also likely to break. A better texture is then obtained. 

Conventional-sponge. Cakes made of oil by the conventional method 
always have a large portion of the oil dispersed as an oil-in-water emulsion. 
See Fig. 65. Nearly the same result was obtained when soft, grainy lards 
were used. Since this distribution of the fat results in a tougher, less de- 
sirable cake than when the major portion of the oil or fat forms a thin 
film at the air/crumb interface, methods of mixing to obtain the latter dis- 
tribution of the fat seemed desirable. It was noted that a spice cake made

from soft, grainy lard, but with no egg, had excellent, very velvety tex- 
ture. Then it was observed that after the egg was added to the cake batter 
the tendency to disperse the soft fat as an oil-in-water emulsion was in- 
creased. From this premise Martin developed several methods of mixing 
to use with lard in cake. When the egg was thoroughly mixed with the milk 
and the milk added as usual the texture of the cakes improved. The 
conventional-sponge method gave still better results. 

The conventional-sponge method has been used in a series of studies by 
McLean, Stone, Buel, Minard, and Myers. The recipe used for this method 
Is Formula I. with Yz cup of fat and 1^ cups of sugar. But a good creamed

ture the fat (black in the photomicrographs) is at the surface of the cake crumb, 
but the layer is more uneven in the conventional than for the conventional-sponge 
method. At the higher temperature the fat is softer and is distributed within the 
cake crumb, which results in a cake of poorer texture. Magnification approximately

volume is not obtained with these proportions because the ratio of sugar to 
fat is too large. Hence when Martin creamed the fat with one-half the 
sugar the volume of the creamed mixture increased. A very small amount 
of flour w^as folded into this creamed mixture, then the remainder of the 
flour and the milk were added in any manner desired. The other half of 
the sugar was beaten with the whole egg until the mixture was thick, 
fluffy, and spongy, resembling a sponge cake batter in texture. This was 
then quickly folded into the cake batter. 

The conventional-sponge method is the only method used in the author's 
laboratory that gives an excellent textured cake when oil is used. Although 
developed to use with soft lard it has been found equally good to use with 
butter and hydrogenated fats. The chief advantage of this method is the 
increased velvetiness of the crumb, which may be related to the fat dis- 
tribution. 

That the method and order of mixing and combining ingredients has an 
effect on the fat distribution is shown in Fig. 67. 

Temperature of the ingredients when the cake batter is mixed. 
At higher temperatures the fat becomes softer, more mobile, and is easier 
to emulsify. When a temperature at which the major portion of the fat is 
emulsified is reached, i.e., when very soft or entirely melted, the cakes are 
poorer in texture and resemble those made from oil by the conventional 
method. See Figs. 65 and 67. 

The extent the batter should be mixed depends to a certain degree upon 
the temperature of the ingredients. If the ingredients are w^arm, the flour 
proteins absorb more water and at a quicker rate than at low tempera- 
tures. The sugar dissolves better, and the fat is distributed more readily. 
Mixing should be shorter w^hen the temperature of the ingredients is high 
and longer when the temperature is low. But, since the fat creams better 
at 24° to 28°C., it is preferable to mix the ingredients at these tempera- 
tures. When the temperature of the ingredients drops to 18° to 19°C. the 
texture of the cake is not as nice as at 24° or slightly higher, even if 
creamed thoroughly on a machine. 

A microscopic study of the distribution of fat in cake batters shows that 
a very important factor in obtaining velvetiness is the way the fat is dis- 
tributed throughout the batter. If the fat forms an oil-in-water emulsion 
the cake is not velvety, for the spheres of fat or oil being surrounded by 
egg and flour cannot impart the softness called velvetiness to the cake. 
When the fat is distributed in rather thick layers, the cake is not velvety, 
for there is not the degree of separation of the other ingredients of the 
cake by the fat to impart this texture. For a velvety texture in the cake 
the major portion of the fat in the batter is distributed in very thin films 
or sheets around the sugar crystals, the air bubbles, and between the other 
ingredients of the batter. The distribution of the fat in thin films is most 
readily obtained when the fat is most plastic. 

Fig. 66 is a photomicrograph of cake batter that shows the butter dis- 
persed as an oil-in-water emulsion. All the materials were incubated at

40°C. and mixed at this temperature. The butter was melted, and during 
mixing an emulsion was formed. This photomicrograph has a higher mag- 
nification than the other photomicrographs used in the illustrations, and 
shows how well the melted fat may be emulsified by mixing. 

Myers studied the effect of two temperatures of ingredients at the time 
of combining on the fat distribution in the baked cake. The temperatures 
used were 25° and 30°C. ; the methods of combining ingredients, the 
conventional-sponge and conventional; and the fats used, butter and both 
smooth and grainy lards. The two lards were from the same source. A suf- 
ficient amount of open-kettle rendered lard for the whole experiment was 
carefully melted and divided into two portions. One part was allowed to 
cool slowly in an incubator at 25 °C. with the result that it was granular 
or grainy with some separated oil. The other portion was cooled within a 
kettle set in a container into which tap water at 10°-15°C. was running 
constantly. More than an hour of constant stirring was required before 
the lard solidified. The product was then set in the constant temperature 
box at 25 °C. for 12 hours, as suggested by a patent to Procter and Gamble 
Company. The resulting lard had a very desirable consistency, neither too 
soft nor too hard and waxy, and was very plastic. 

The analysis of variance of total scores shows that the variation due to 
temperature, method of combining, and fat used were all highly significant. 
A total of 300 cakes was made and the average total scores are given in 
Table 57.

an oil-in-water emulsion. As a result the cakes were less palatable and re- 
ceived lower scores. 

Extent o£ mixing and its effect on the baked cake. Several illus- 
trations accompany this part of the discussion of cakes. For the illustrations 
150 grams of batter were always used and the cakes were baked in pans 
of the same size. This small amount of batter was used so that the grain, 
holes, and imperfections of texture and the volume are shown nearly actual 
size. As reproduced the illustrations are seven-ninths of the actual size of 
the cakes. Incidentally, it is difficult to make cake without some irregular 
holes from enclosed air, and these imperfections show more in the picture 
than in the cake. The ingredients for the cakes were 23 °C. when mixed. 
The butter, sugar, and beaten egg were creamed only 75 turns with a 
rotary egg beater and 100 times with a wooden spoon, thus they were not 
thoroughly creamed, hence a coarser texture was produced. They were also 
baked at a lower temperature than now considered optimum. The very plain 
cake recipe, see Experiment 84, is used in the experimental outline because 
variations in extent of mixing and the proportion of ingredients show very 
distinctly. For a plain cake recipe for home use most people will prefer 
the sugar increased to 1^ cups. 

Extent of mixing, its effect upon crust and shape of cake. With very 
little mixing, so that the ingredients are just combmed but not blended 
until the batter is smooth (cakes number 1, Figs. 68 to 70, with 50 
strokes), the top of the cake is nearly level or slightly rounded. It browns 
well and is rough. The crust has considerable glaze. As the amount of 
mixing is increased the crust is less rough, has less glaze, does not brown 
so well, and is more rounded across the top, until with more than an 
optimum amount of beating, 300 to 400 strokes in this cake, the crust be- 
comes dull in appearance and quite smooth. There is a tendency for the 
top to come to a peak instead of being rounded. Small holes may be notice- 
able. Over these holes there is often a very thin layer of crust that covers 
the end of a long tunnel that extends up through the cake. With decided 
excess of mixing, 1000 strokes, the top may be level or only slightly 
rounded and is very dull and smooth in appearance and nearly white in 
color. The appearance of the crust of cake made with sulfate-phosphate 
baking powder. Fig. 70, changes with increased mixing but not so rapidly 
as in the cakes made with the phosphate or tartrate baking powder. 

Extent of mixing, its effect upon volume. When the cake is just mixed 
so that no dry ingredients show, the volume of the cake may be less than 
when the batter is stirred a little longer, or it may be larger. With more 
mixing, 100 to 150 strokes, the volume may or may not increase. Con- 
tinued beating after an amount sufficient to give the maximum volume 
decreases the volume in proportion to the degree of over-mixing. With 
more than an optimum amount of mixing the volumes of cakes containing 
a phosphate or a tartrate baking powder decrease more rapidly than those 



MIXING AND THE TEXTURE OF CAKE 499 

of the cakes made with sulfate-phosphate baking powder. See Figs. 68 
to 70. 

Extent of mixing, its effect upon texture. With a definite proportion of 
ingredients the texture as well as the character of the crust and the volume 
varies with the extent of mixing. The cakes in which the ingredients are 
just mixed so as to show no dry flour do not have a desirable texture. 
See cakes 1 in illustrations. The ingredients of the cake are not well 
blended, and the crumb has a horny, flinty texture, which is sometimes 
called bready. The crumb is crumbly. It is not smooth and velvety on 
the palate. The cell walls are thick and the cells coarse and large in size. 
A cake made with this amount of mixing dries out and stales in a very 
much shorter time than portions of the same batter mixed for a longer time. 
With more mixing the grain of the cake is finer and the cell walls thinner. 
The crumb is smooth and velvety when tasted, and the ingredients are well 
blended. With a definite amount of mixing of the plain cake batter, 150 
to 400 strokes, which varies somewhat with the kind of baking powder 
used, the maker's technic, and the temperature of the ingredients, tunnels 
begin to appear. More mixing than the optimum produces a finer grain, or 
smaller cells, until a stage is reached, 1000 strokes or more, at which the 
texture is very compact or even soggy and solid. 

Swanson and Working, also Bailey and Le Vesconte, have shown that 
extended mixing of bread dough modifies the quality of the gluten, and 
its extensibility is decreased. It seems logical to expect this stage to develop 
in cakes as well as in bread, although on account of the different propor- 
tion of ingredients the amount of mixing to bring this about may vary 
from the amount required for bread. Several factors may aid in producing 
the small volume with 1000 strokes. These include the extent of mixing, 
its effect upon the gluten, the effect of the baking powder upon the gluten, 
and the loss of carbon dioxide formed from the baking powder. 

Tunnels. Tunnels in cakes develop in the same way as the tunnels in 
mufHns. Gas expands in a weakened section of the batter. This weaker sec- 
tion is between long parallel strands of gluten which have been stretched 
and developed in mixing and in putting the batter in the pans. An excess 
of flour, see Fig. 71, and too much mixing tend to favor the formation of 
tunnels. An increased percentage of sugar lessens the tendency to form 
tunnels. A high baking temperature may tend to increase the tendency 
for tunnel formation, but is quite variable. Tunnels are formed more 
often when small portions of the batter are baked in small deep pans 
than when the whole cake recipe is baked in a large or a shallow pan, 
for the batter for the small cake is usually dropped from a spoon, whereas 
for the larger cakes it is more often poured into the cake pan. Tunnels do 
not develop so often if the batter is stirred with a circular motion as 
they do when the batter is beaten across the bowl. The reason for this is 
that, if the batter is stirred, the mixing utensil is pulled around and around 
the bowl and after a definite amount of mixing the appearance of the batter

is similar to that in Fig. 71. When some of this batter is removed with 
a spoon to put in a cake pan, the spoon cuts across the strands or ridges 
developed during stirring, and tunnels are not so likely to occur in the 
baked cake. In beating, unless the bowl is turned while mixing, the strands 
or ridges have formed across the bowl instead of around it. If the spoon

is dipped or the batter is poured in the same direction in which the strands 
are formed, the tendency to develop tunnels is augmented. If the bowl 
is turned while the batter is beaten, there is no more tendency for tunnels 
to form than when the batter is stirred. 

Optunum amount of inixing for plain cake. In the plain cake the 
optimum amount of mixing varies with ( 1 ) the thoroughness of creaming, 




Fig. 71. — Showing the strands formed and their direction in a batter that is 
stirred. 

(2) the intensity of mixing, (3) the temperature of the ingredients, (4) 
the type of baking powder used, (5) the quantity of baking powder used, 
and (6) the point at which the baking powder is added. When the butter, 
sugar, and egg are thoroughly creamed, the optimum amount of mixing may 
extend over a wider range. Most of these factors have been considered. For 
the very plain cake recipe, when a phosphate or tartrate powder is used, about 
150 to 200 strokes give the best texture, if the baking powder is added with 
the flour. A sulfate-phosphate powder requires about 250 to 300 strokes for

the best texture. As the sugar In the recipe is increased to give a more de- 
sirable cake, the optimum amount of mixing is greater, but is more nearly 
the same for all the different types of baking powder. 

For Formula I, with 1^ cups of sugar, which is a more desirable plain 
cake, about 225 to 250 strokes, or sometimes more, are sufficient for mixing 
the flour and milk with the creamed mixture to produce a good texture.

Effect of extent of mixing on staling. Olsen used the compressibility 
apparatus designed by Piatt in trying to determine the effect of extent of 
mixing upon the staling of plain cake. It was found that cakes mixed for 
different lengths of time could not be compared with each other. Those 
mixed for a very short period had a loose, coarse, porous texture, which 
permitted greater penetration of the plunger Into the crumb. The cakes 
mixed for a longer period were compact in texture and offered more resist- 
ance to penetration of the plunger. It was found there was a tendency 
for the cakes creamed a short time to stale more rapidly than those creamed 
for a longer period. The rate of staling was greatest during the first 24 
hours. It was less rapid from 24 to 48 hours and continued at a still slower 
rate from 48 to 96 hours. Formula I was used for tests. 



504

Variation o£ proportion of ingredients. As the proportion of 
ingredients used in the cake is varied the appearance of the crust and the 
top of the cake differs from that of the plain cake. The extent of mix- 
ing to give the most desirable texture may also need to be changed. 

The proportion of baking powder. McLean used varying amounts of 
three types of baking powder to determine the optimum quantity of each 
powder for plain cake (Formula I). 

The effect on the cake volume of increasing the baking powder is shown 
in Fig. 72. The volume increases with increased quantity of powder used

until a point is reached at which the cake falls, the volume decreasing with 
still greater increments of baking powder. This decrease in volume occurs 
with a larger quantity than that shown in the graphs. 

From Fig. 73 a comparison may be made of the change m score caused by 
increasing the weight of a tartrate, phosphate, or a sulfate-phosphate (com- 
bination) powder in plain cake and again a comparison may be drawn 
between the scores for cakes made with an equal weight of the three dif- 
ferent types of baking powder. McLean found that the palatability and 
desirability of the cakes, as shown by the scores, progressively increased 
with increased weight of the powders until the optimum quantity of baking 
powder is reached. With a further increase beyond the optimum amount the 
desirability of the cakes decreased. The decrease in desirability was most 



BAKING POWDER 505 

rapid with the powder giving the greatest volume, indicating that it is 
more detrimental to use too much of a sulfate-phosphate baking powder 
than of a tartrate or phosphate. For the formula, the method of mixing 
used, and for the brands of baking powder used in the investigations, the 
optimum quantity of each powder was as follows: sulfate-phosphate, 8 to 
10 grams; tartrate, 10 grams; and phosphate, 12 grams. 

An increase in the quantity of a baking powder over and above the op- 
timum amount causes an increasing tendency to produce a coarse, loose 
texture, crumbliness, a harsh crumb, a lack of velvetiness, and a possible 
off flavor. With enough baking powder to cause the cake to fall an increas- 
ingly gummy, sticky, chewy texture is obtained. Too little baking powder 
gives a cake that is too compact. 

The measure of the optimum amount of each type of powder as deter- 
mined by McLean is approximately 3 teaspoons, if the average weight of a 
teaspoon is taken as 3, 3.5, and 4 grams for the sulfate-phosphate, tartrate, 
and phosphate baking powders, respectively. Since 3 cups of flour were used 
in the recipe, this would indicate that it is possible to use 1 teaspoon of 
baking powder per cup of flour for all three types of powders. Since a tea- 
spoon of some brands does not weigh the same as the brands used by Mc- 
Lean, the measure for these brands would vary. 

Probably the chief reason for the variation in weight of different types 
and different brands of the same type is the fineness of subdivision or 
grinding of the ingredients. 

The following weights for a teaspoon of baking powder have been sug- 
gested and used. 

Type of powder Halliday and Noble Woodruff 

Grams per teaspoon Grams per teaspoon 
Phosphate 4.00 3.52 

Tartrate 3.67 3.07 

Sulfate-phosphate 3.70 2.85 

The weights by Woodruff were determined by finding the average 
weight of a cup of the powder and taking 1/48 of this for the weight of a 
teaspoon. From the above weights it can readily be calculated that 3 tea- 
spoons of the sulfate-phosphate powder by the Halliday and Noble scale are 
equal to about 4 teaspoons by the Woodruff scale. When measured by 
teaspoons rather than by cups the averages of Woodruff are low. 

The weight of a teaspoon of baking powder can vary considerably even 
when a standard measuring spoon is used. For accurate experimental work 
the baking powder is weighed, but the housekeeper usually measures the 
ingredients for her cakes. Dipping the measuring spoon into the can and 
leveling off the surplus tends to loosen the powder. Thus the weight of the 
second or third teaspoon of powder will vary, depending on whether 
it is secured from the loosened or the more compact portions in the can. 
As the powder stands in the can it tends to become more compact. The 
averages for about 400 teaspoons of each type of powder, secured by leveling 
off the surplus powder after dipping the spoon in the can, have been about 



506 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

3.0 grams for one brand of sulfate-phosphate, about 4.0 grams for a second 
brand, about 4.0 for the phosphate, and about 3.5 for the tartrate. 

Of course the optimum amount of baking powder, in addition to ( 1 ) the 
type of baking powder, varies with (2) the formula, (3) the thoroughness 
of creaming, (4) the method of mixing, (5) the extent of mixing, (6) the 
kind of flour used, (7) the technic of the operator, (8) time of adding the 
beaten egg white, and (9) the altitude. 

In general, formulas with high proportions of sugar seem to require 
slightly more baking powder than those with smaller proportions. 

The more thoroughly the butter and sugar, or the butter, sugar, and 
eggs, are creamed, the more air incorporated and the less baking powder 
needed. Of course, no more than a maximum amount of air can be incor- 
porated in any given mixture. 

Methods of mixing like the conventional-sponge in which a great deal of 
air is incorporated in the egg-sugar mixture may need slightly less baking 
powder than the conventional method. 

There is a limit to which cake batters can be stirred or beaten without 
affecting the tenderness of the product. In general, the sulfate-phosphat;^ 
types can be mixed longer than the other types of powders. 

Because of the tenacity of the gluten, more baking powder is needed 
with bread or all-purpose than for pastry or cake flours. 

If the beaten egg whites are added to the batter last, either by folding or 
stirring, a smaller proportion of baking powder produces a more desirable 
texture. 

As the distance above sea level increases, the atmospheric pressure is 
decreased. Consequently, because of the reduced pressure, a given quantity 
of baking powder has greater leavening ability at higher altitudes. Hence 
a smaller amount of any type of powder is needed at higher altitudes. 
Peterson has developed recipes for high altitudes. 

That baking powder has an effect on the viscosity of the batter is shown 
clearly by adding varying amounts of baking powder (Experiment 84D) 
to a particular cake recipe. A much stiffer, thicker batter is secured with 
the larger quantity of baking powder. 

Varying the proportiori of egg. With increased egg the cell walls become 
thinner and the cells smaller and regular in shape as the mixing is con- 
tinued. When the egg is increased the crumb is very elastic, the cake more 
rubbery, tough, and compact. Increasing the egg imparts a glaze to the 
crust, but the appearance is different from, and less crystalline than, that 
produced with increased sugar. The plain cake recipe with increased egg 
and no other changes is not so desirable as the original recipe. If egg is 
increased, a better texture is obtained if the white is beaten separately and 
added last. 

Varying the proportion of sugar. Sugar is added for sweetening. But it 
also affects the texture of the product. With larger quantities of sugar the 
batter must be mixed longer even when baking powders that react rapidly 
at low temperatures are used. The sugar competes with the gluten and 



BALANCING CAKE FORMULAS 507 

other ingredients for the liquid and prevents the development of the gluten 
so that longer mixing is necessary. When the sugar in the very plain cake 
recipe is increased from 1 to 1^ cups a sweeter cake is obtained and one 
with a better-balanced formula, so that a better texture and volume are 
obtained. The amount of mixing to produce the best texture with Ij^ 
cups of sugar is from 225 to 300 strokes when a tartrate or phosphate 
baking powder is used, if the powder is added with the flour. When the 
proportion of sugar is increased to 2 cups, Fig. 74, a decidedly different 
texture is obtained from that when the flour or egg is increased. With 
slight mixing the top of the cake is sunken or fallen; see Fig. 74, cake 
number 1, mixed with 50 strokes. Experiment 84F,4. Sometimes the cake 
bubbles up over the top of the pan and then falls. The top is rough, shiny, 
and has a crystalline appearance. The cell walls are very thick and the cells 
are large and coarse. The cake browns readily. It is gummy and chewy 
when tasted. As the amount of mixing is increased the texture of the 
cake is improved. The number of strokes required to produce a fine grain 
is very much greater than in the plain cake. The texture with 1000 and 
1500 strokes, cakes numbers 5 and 6, Fig. 74, is very much better than in 
the cakes just slightly mixed. The most desirable texture is sometimes ob- 
tained with 400 strokes, sometimes with 1000, and occasionally with 1500. 
The cakes with increased sugar used in the illustrations were made with 
a tartrate baking powder. 

Varying the proportion of fat. Increasing the fat results in a more 
tender cake. The fat in the plain cake recipe can be increased from ^ cup 
to ^ cup and a good texture obtained, but the volume of the cake is smaller. 
The cake is better if the sugar and eggs are increased at the same time. 
The appearance of the crust of a cake with a large amount of fat is rather 
smooth. It browns readily, but not so easily as with sugar. 

Varying the proportion of flour. If the flour is very dry a better texture 
is obtained when the flour is reduced. If the proportion of flour in the 
plain ,cake is increased the tendency to tunnel is increased. The cake is drier 
and more solid. The volume is good. When the flour in the plain cake 
recipe is increased to 3^^ cups. Experiment 84F,7, Fig. 75, the tenacity 
of the batter becomes very great. As the gluten is developed by mixing, 
long strands show in the batter when the mixing spoon is pulled through 
it. Often after mixing 1000 strokes ribbons of batter from ^ to ^ inch 
in width and over a foot long will form when the batter is allowed to 
drop from the spoon. 

Balancing cake formulas. Various ways and means are suggested for 
balancing cake formulas. The single variation of the plain recipe in the 
experimental outline that usually gives the most acceptable cake is to increase 
the sugar from 1 to 1^ cups. This recipe is Formula I in Table 58. 

Bakers have different rules for balancing cake formulas, but they state 
there will always be exceptions to these rules. They also mix larger 
quantities in one batch than the housewife, often 20 to 50 pounds or more 
at one time. It is well known that in large-quantity cookery the propor- 



508 



BATTERS AND DOUGHS 



tion of liquid must be decreased, or if a very small portion of the recipe 
is made, the liquid must be increased. In many instances the rules given 
in bakery trade journals sift down to the following or similar sugges- 
tions.

Chocolate cake. Probably the question most often asked the author 
concerning chocolate cake is how to obtain a red one. The usual reply 
before answering the query is, "Why do you want a red chocolate cake?" 



512 



BATTERS AND DOUGHS 



Chocolate. For a better understanding of the action of chocolate some 
knowledge of its production is necessary. Chocolate is obtained from cacao 
beans of the cacao tree. The term cacao is used to refer to the raw material 
until the press cake stage. The term cocoa refers to the powder. The beans 
are cut from the pods, placed in piles, and fermented. Fermentation reduces 
the bitterness of the chocolate. After fermentation the beans are roasted.

After being roasted the beans are shelled and cracked. The cracked beans 
are called nibs. The roasting brings out the flavor, but Zenlea states that 
the flavor of the chocolate is dependent upon the skill used in blending, 
milling, and couching of the various varieties of nibs with the proper 
quantity of sugar and cocoa butter, milk solids, when used, and added 
flavors. There are approximately 30 varieties of cocoa beans commonly 
used and Zenlea says the nibs of these beans vary in color, chocolate char- 
acter, pungency, acidity, mildness, bitterness, and creaminess. The blended 
nibs are ground, a temperature just above 32°C. (90°F,) being maintained 
during grinding, this temperature and the pressure rendering the product 
fluid. This chocolate liquor, which contains over 50 per cent of cocoa butter, 
is run into molds and cooled for chocolate, forming the bitter chocolate for 
household and commercial uses. In the "Service and Regulatory Announce- 
ments" of the Food and Drug Administration chocolate, plain chocolate, 
bitter chocolate, chocolate liquor, chocolate paste, bitter chocolate grating, 
all are defined as the solid or plastic mass obtained by grinding cacao nibs. 
Sweet chocolate, sweet chocolate coating, is chocolate mixed with sugar 
and/or dextrose, with or without the addition of cacao butter, spices, or 



CHOCOLATE CAKE 513 

other flavoring materials. But the proportion of sugar mixed with the 
chocolate liquor may vary from none to about 68 per cent. 

The cocoa beans before being ground vary in color from a very light 
brown, or nearly gray, to a deep red brown. Thus the color of the choco- 
late or cocoa may vary because of the different colored beans from which 
it is made. A higher roast also gives a darker color. Alkali-treated chocolate 
is also darker than natural-processed chocolate. 

Though the amount of sugar added to chocolate liquor varies greatly 
and the blends of chocolate are unlimited, Zenlea makes the following 
classifications of general types: bitter-sweet, dark-sweet, medium-dark 
sweet, light-sweet, milk, ice cream bar, skim milk, buttermilk, malted milk, 
imitation, and lecithin coatings. Bywaters states that the tannin group of 
substances is a very important constituent of cacao matter, "for it deter- 
mines to a great extent the colour and the taste of the product. Cacao 
catechin and cacao tannin are present in the fresh unfermented bean." The 
catechin gives a very b'tter flavor. Adam and Jensen have both determined 
the amount of catechin and cacao tannin in the unfermented bean and in 
the manufactured chocolate and cocoa. During fermentation the cacao 
catechin is transformed to cacao tannin. The amount of cacao tannin found 
in the fully fermented beans averages 1.9 per cent. 

Bywaters states that cacao tannin in the presence of oxygen is trans- 
formed into a phlobaphene, which is insoluble in water and reddish in color. 
The red color of cocoa is chiefly due to the presence of this phlobaphene. 

To make cocoa the chocolate liquor is put in a hydraulic press and part 
of the cocoa butter is removed, leaving a cake containing less than one-half 
as much cocoa butter as the chocolate. This cake is pulverized. 

Cocoa. Zenlea states that there are many kinds of cocoas, but depending 
on processing they may be separated into two main classifications: (a) 
natural and (b) Dutch. 

Natural-process cocoas have had no alkalies or **Dutching agents" added 
during manufacture. Schaal states that probably about 75 per cent of the 
cocoas used by bakers are natural-processed cocoas. Some chocolate is also 
"Dutch" processed. 

Dutch-process cocoas have been treated with an alkaline solution such as 
potassium carbonate, ammonium bicarbonate, or sodium carbonate or 
bicarbonate. In some instances, according to Zenlea, the cleaned nibs are 
actually boiled in an alkali solution as strong as 3 per cent, based on the 
weight of the nibs. In commercial practise 2 per cent of alkali is more 
commonly used. To complete the treatment, the water is evaporated and 
the Dutch nibs dried in a roaster. The nibs are then treated in the same 
manner as nibs for natural-process cocoas. 

Bywaters gives the object of the Dutch process as follows : ( 1 ) To im- 
prove the flavor, (2) to improve the color, (3) to improve the solubility, 
and (4) to improve the digestibility. The proportion of cocoa that can be 
dissolved is less than 25 per cent, even after treatment. The treatment 



514 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

darkens the color. Zenlea states that natural cocoas have a pH value of 
5.2 to 6.0; chocolate 5.1 to 6.2; ''Dutched" cocoas have a pH of 6.0 to 
7.5 ; and chocolate a pH 6.0 to 7.8. The reaction depends on the original 
pH of the nibs and the quantity and kind of alkali added. 

Chocolate and cocoa contain some organic acids such as acetic and 
tartaric. The reaction of the cocoa determines the amount of soda that can 
be neutralized by the cocoa or chocolate in cooking. Less soda should be 
used with a Dutched cocoa in such products as cake and cookies in which 
soda is used, for the natural acidity of the cocoa has been lessened by the 
creatment. 

Zenlea describes the following types of cocoas : ( 1 ) Semi-cocoas, not on 
the market in powder form, with 32 to 45 per cent fat content, and used 
for fine quality ice cream and icings. (2) High-quality cocoas containing 25 
to 35 per cent fat. A higher fat content would prevent their preparation 
in powder form and a lower fat content causes loss of aromatic constitu- 
ents. (3) Breakfast cocoas contain not less than 22 per cent cocoa butter. 
(4) Semi-dry cocoas contain 15 to 18 per cent fat and are used for malted- 
milk mixtures and other products in which with more fat there is difficulty 
in keeping the fat uniformly distributed, and with less fat the cocoa flavor 
is too strong. (5), (6), and (7) Dry, extra dry, and very dry cocoas con- 
tain 10 to 12, 8 to 9, and 6^ to 7% per cent of fat, respectively. (8) 
Solvent extracted cocoas contain from 0.5 to 3.0 per cent fat and have 
practically no chocolate flavor. And (9) prepared cocoas, which are cocoa 
mixtures containing such materials as sugar, skim milk, and malt. 

The less the fat content of the cocoa the more readily it absorbs moisture 
from the air and the greater its thickening power when combined with 
water. 

Zenlea declares the ideal temperature and humidity for storing cocoa to 
be 60-70°F. and 50-65 relative humidity. Heat, vibration, and moisture 
cause cocoa to lump and lose its apparent color, which makes it more diffi- 
cult to mix, though its quality may not be damaged. 

The use of chocolate and cocoa in cake. The factors influencing the color 
of chocolate cake may be listed as follows. ( 1 ) Reaction. This is probably 
the most important factor in producing a red mahogany-colored chocolate 
cake, the cakes having this color usually having an alkaline reaction. Grewe 
states that the "color constituent of chocolate is yellow at pH 5 and changes 
to red at pH 7.5," but she does not state what this color constituent is. 

Schaal states that whenever the pH of the finished cake is above 7.9, 
the soda taste is pronounced and objectionable. He recommends that hot 
water and soda should not be mixed nor the soda combined with the choco- 
late and hot water, for leavening gas is lost and the cake color is a too 
**foxy" red. The soda, he says, may be creamed with the shortening and 
cocoa, or it may be dissolved in the cold milk. In addition, the soda may be 
mixed with the flour. 

Chocolate has a slight acidity which will neutralize a small amount 



CHOCOLATE CAKE 515 

of soda, but many chocolate cake recipes call for an excess of soda, which 
gives an alkaline reaction. As the excess is increased, the soapy, bitter, 
alkaline flavor of the soda becomes more evident. Sweet milk and soda are 
likely to impart a deeper red or mahogany shade than sour milk and soda, 
for the acidity of the sour milk neutralizes a part or all of the alkalinity of 
the soda, the extent depending upon the amount of soda used. The use of 
soda, whether enough is used to give an alkaline reaction or not, always 
darkens the color; a lighter shade is obtained with baking powder. This 
darkening is probably due to the tannin constituents, for similar results 
are obtained with molasses or sorghum in gingerbread, the shade being 
darker with soda and lighter when baking powder is used. 

(2) Time. This factor as in other reactions is also important, the 
length of time the batter containing soda stands before baking influencing 
the color obtained. It has been found that cake batter which has stood 
10 to 15 minutes — some cake bakers often permit it to stand while they 
bake a test cake — usually gives a richer mahogany shade than a portion 
of the same batter baked immediately after mixing. These results have 
not always been consistent with different varieties of chocolate and cocoa, 
but are obtained in a majority of the experiments. 

(3) The quantity of chocolate or cocoa used. The shade is darker with 
a larger quantity. 

(4) The brand of chocolate or cocoa used. The reasons for variation 
in color with different brands of chocolate and cocoa have been indicated 
under their production. There is also a difference in the flavor of different 
brands of chocolate and cocoa. 

(5) The kind of baking powder used. It was quite a surprise to find 
that, when butter, sugar, eggs, and chocolate have been mixed together 
(Experiment 85B,5), then divided, and a different baking powder used 
with each portion, the same shade is not obtained with all the different 
baking powders. 

But after all is said, why try to develop the red color? The very rich 
mahogany red cannot be developed except with an alkaline reaction, which 
is obtained by using an excess of soda. It has been the experience in the 
author's laboratory that nearly all the students prefer the flavor of choco- 
late cakes that do not contain an excess of soda. An excess of soda destroys 
the distinctive chocolate flavor, and if a chocolate cake is eaten for real 
chocolate flavor, a rich brown shade will be preferred to the mahogany one. 

Chocolate and cocoa contain starch. During the production of chocolate, 
part of the starch has been dextrinized, and this partially dextrinized starch 
thickens the cold cake batter, the other portion of the starch thickening 
when heated. For this reason the flour used in chocolate cakes must be 
reduced, the proportion of liquid increased, or the fat and sugar increased. 
The sugar needs to be increased because of the strong flavor of the choco- 
late. Although chocolate itself contains fat, the texture and perhaps the 



516 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

flavor are Improved if the chocolate cake recipe contains a rather high 
percentage of fat. 

White cake. White cake usually contains a greater proportion of 
sugar than a plain cake. Sometimes it contains a larger proportion of fat 
too. Egg whites are added, but the egg yolks are omitted. In the conven- 
tional method of mixing white cake the beaten egg whites are folded into 
the batter after the other ingredients have been mixed. 

The beaten egg white may also be folded or stirred into the fat and 
sugar with the flour and milk. This method, Experiment 86,6, usually 
produces a cake that is more tender than the cake made by the conven- 
tional method. Stirring the beaten egg white into the flour mixture is 
easier, and as in the plain cake seems to give as good results as folding. 
The texture of the white cake is usually better if the flour and liquid are 
added in portions and not all at one time. 

Gingerbread. To discuss the effect of manipulation and the kind and 
proportion of ingredients used in gingerbread would be only to repeat 
what has been stated under muffins and cakes. 

Effect of alkali upon texture of gingerbread. Soda is used with the 
molasses or sorghum for leavening in gingerbread. Excess soda is often 
used. For this reason gingerbread offers an excellent opportunity to observe 
the effect of an excess of alkali upon the texture and the flavor of a batter. 

The gluten of bread dough becomes more elastic, more extensible and 
more soluble, i.e., dispersion is increased, as the acidity of the dough 
increases. This results in a greater volume of the bread until a degree of 
acidity is reached at which the gluten becomes too tender to stretch as 
the gas forms. At this point some of the gluten films break and the cell 
walls collapse. As the acidity is increased, more and more cells collapse 
and a bread with a thicker, coarser texture is produced. 

The gluten also becomes more elastic and more extensible with alkalies. 
As the alkalinity is increased, the solubility or dispersion of the gluten 
increases more rapidly than on the acid side. Thus with an alkaline 
reaction the cell walls become more tender and collapse more quickly than 
with an acid reaction. This with the larger proportion of liquid gives the 
typical coarse structure of some gingerbreads and chocolate cakes. 

Fortenbacker and Koch made a study of the effect on gluten of various 
concentrations of acids, alkalies, and salts found in baking mixtures. They 
found the gluten to be more soluble in alkaline solutions, for concen- 
trations used in baking mixtures, than in acid solutions. In fact, the gluten 
disintegrated rapidly in alkaline solutions of increasing concentration, so 
that the gluten discs could be left in only for short periods or they could 
not be lifted to be weighed. Because of the gluten being dispersed it loses 
some of its elasticity. The cakes are tender owing to the dissolving of the 
gluten. 

The gingerbread batter like all cake batters contains enough buffer sub- 
stances so that with the addition of alkali it does not become as alkaline 



GINGERBREAD 517 

as it otherwise would. Thus with the addition of 2 teaspoons of soda, 
Experiment 87,1, the batter is not as distinctly alkaline as would be 
expected, though the flavor is quite evident. With the large proportion of 
soda a hollow may form in the center of the gingerbread during baking. 
This is more likely to develop if the batter is allowed to stand a short 
time before baking. The soda causes partial dispersion of the gluten. The 
baking sets the crust, but the interior of the cake being baked last, the 
soda continues its action on the gluten during part of the baking with 
the result that the cake may be level across the top but have a hollow 
in the center. Sometimes the cake sinks across the top instead of forming 
the hollow in the center. With longer mixing and greater attenuation of 
the gluten the sinking does not occur. 

The gingerbreads containing the largest proportion of soda are darker 
in color. This is due to several factors, i.e., the effect of the soda on the 
color of the flour, the decomposition of the monosaccharids of the molasses 
by the soda, but principally to the color produced by the tannins of the 
molasses in an alkaline solution. The gingerbreads with baking powder and 
soda are lighter in color. The flavor of the gingerbread made with baking 
powder and no soda is different from that of gingerbread containing soda, 
particularly when a strong molasses is used, probably because the soda 
combines with some of the ingredients of the molasses, thus producing a 
less strong flavor. With excess soda, its soapy, alkaline flavor is evident.

A. Temperature of baking. 

Prepare %. of the recipe. To the boiling water add the butter; then the 
flour. Stir while adding the flour and cook until the material has a tendency 
to form a ball and leave the sides of the pan. The paste is done when a 
metal spoon pressed down lightly leaves a clear, smooth print. Remove from 
the fire and add the beaten eggs in two portions. Beat thoroughly after adding 
the first half of the egg and until smooth and even in texture after the last 
half is added. One-fourth the recipe makes 3 fairly large puffs. Drop on baking 
sheets and bake at the following temperatures: 190° to 200°C. (375° to 
390°F.), 220° to 225°C. (425° to 435°F.), and 240° to 250°C. (465° to 
480°F.). Bake until the puffs are quite firm to the touch. If any become too 
brown lower the temperature of the oven, or if nearly done turn off the gas 
and let set in the oven until firm to the touch. 

The following suggestions for records of the experiments with cream puffs 
are given.

Experiment 81. 

To determine when baking powder should be added to a batter. 
I. To determine the factors that affect the texture, tenderness, and flavor of 
wafl[les. 

Recipe for plain waffles: 

Milk 1 cup 244 grams 

Eggs 2 96 grams 

Flour 1 to 1>^ cups 112 to 168 grams 

Oil or melted fat 2 tablespoons 25 grams 

Salt y2 teaspoon 

Baking powder to \}4 teaspoons to 6 grams 

Sift the flour and baking powder together 2 times. Separate the yolk and 
white of the egg. It will be necessary to beat at least a whole white or yolk; 
then divide it. Mix the fat, beaten yolk, salt, and milk. Add the flour, stir 
only until well blended, and count the strokes used for combining. Beat the 
egg white until stiff and fold into the batter. Count the number of strokes 
used for folding the white. Use the same kind of baking powder for all the 
experiments until section C is reached. The amount of ingredients given 
under each experiment is for the full recipe. 

Heat the waffle iron. Test the temperature, if the iron does not have a 
temperature indicator, by placing a drop of water on the iron. If the drop 
boils rapidly the iron is hot enough. If the drop boils so vigorously that it 
vaporizes very rapidly, the iron is too hot. It is better to have the waffle irons 
of the same make and type for some experiments so that the depth of the batter 
will be the same for all waffles. Put the baked waflSes on cake coolers until 
comparisons are made. Putting the baked waffles on plates causes the under side 
to sweat and become soggy. To keep warm place wire cake cooler with waflUe 
in slightly warmed oven. 

A. The time of baking waffles. 

1. Prepare ^ of the recipe. Use XYz cups of flour (150 grams), and 4 
grams, about 1 teaspoon of baking powder. Bake one waffle 3 minutes, one 4 
minutes, and one 5 minutes. The time may need to be varied depending on the 
temperature maintained by the iron. Compare for crispness and tenderness.

Stiff Batters 

Muffins 

Experiment 82. 

To determine the factors which affect the texture of muffins and the amount 
of mixing required with different types of baking powders. 
Recipe: 

Flour 2 cups 224 grams 

Sugar 2 tablespoons 25 grams 

Milk 1 cup 244 grams 

Egg 1 48 grams 

Fat, melted or oil 2 tablespoons 25 grams 

Baking powder 12 grams 

Salt y2 teaspoon 2 grams 

Directions for combining. 

Combine the milk, beaten tgg, and melted fat. Since the batter is mixed very 
little after the dry ingredients are added, it is better to beat the egg enough 
so that it readily combines with the milk, or beat both egg and milk with the 
egg beater. Sift the baking powder with the flour twice. Mix the sugar and 
salt with the flour. Add the dry ingredients to the liquid, and stir. Bake the 
muffins in greased cups of the same size and the same material. The sides of 
the cups do not need greasing, but the bottoms should be well greased to 
facilitate removal of the muffins from the tins. Decrease the baking powder to 
10 or less grams or increase to 14 or 16 grams, depending on the type of flour 
used and the altitude. 

A. To determine the effect of the amount of mixing upon the texture and 
volume of muffins. 

1. Prepare ^ the recipe. Use a tartrate baking powder. Notice the way 
the batter changes while mixing. Describe this change. Compare the volume 
of the batters for each muffin. Does the same weight of batter give the same 
volume after mixing different amounts? 

Stir the batter. Combine with 25 strokes. For a medium-sized pan remove 
60 grams of batter for one muffin. Stir the remaining batter a total of 60 
strokes. Remove 60 grams for another muffin. Stir the remaining batter a 
total of 100 strokes. Remove 60 grams for a third muffin. Beat the remaining 
batter a total of 300 strol'es and use 60 grams for the fourth muffin. Bake 
at 210°C. (410°F.).

B. To determine the effect upon the texture and the volume of muffins of 
adding the baking powder after the batter has been mixed. 

1. Prepare % of the recipe. Reserve the baking powder to add later. Use a 
tartrate baking powder. Stir the batter, using 30 strokes. Sift the baking 
powder over the batter and stir into the batter with 15 strokes. Notice the 
consistency of the batter before adding the baking powder, while adding the 
powder, and after it has stood a few seconds. Divide into 2 muffins of 60 grams 
each. 

2. Repeat Bl, but use a phosphate baking powder. 

3. Repeat Bl, but use S.-P. baking powder. 

What is the effect of increased mixing on the texture and the volume of 
muffins when the baking powder is in the mixture from the first? What 
amount of mixing produces the best texture in muffins? Does this vary with 
the different baking powders? May the baking powder be added after 
the batter is mixed? Is it the amount of mixing or the mixing when 
the baking powder is in the batter or both that has the greatest effect 
upon the volume and the texture of the muffins? Could the batter be beaten 
longer than 30 strokes before adding the baking powder and a good texture 
be obtained? 

C. To determine the amount of mixing that gives a muffin of the best flavor, 
tenderness, texture, and volume. 

1. Prepare ^ of the recipe. Use a tartrate baking powder. Stir a total 
of 25 strokes. Remove 60 grams of batter for one muffin. Stir the remaining 
batter a total of 30 strokes. Remove 60 grams of batter for a second muffin. 
Stir the remaining batter a total of 35 strokes. Remove 60 grams of batter 
for a third muffin. Stir the remaining batter a total of 40 strokes and bake 
60 grams for a fourth muffin.

Baking Powder Biscuits 
Experiment 83. 

To determine the factors that influence the texture of baking powder 
biscuits. 

Recipe: 



Flour 


2% cups 


300.0 grams 


Fat 


4 tablespoons 


50.0 grams 


Milk 


^ to 1 cup 


188.0 to 244 grams 


Baking powder 




12 grams 


Salt 


}4 teaspoon 


2 grams 



Directions for combining. 

Sift the baking powder with the flour. Add the fat and the salt. The fat 
may be combined with the flour by a fat-flour blender or by using the tips of the 
fingers. Portions of the fat and flour are picked up and rubbed quickly between 
the fingers, then dropped and other portions of the flour picked up. The lifting 
of the portions of the flour and fat mixture makes it more light and fluffy. 
Avoid mixing until a hard fat is melted and the mixture looks oily and com- 
pact. After the fat is mixed with the flour, form a cavity in the center of the 
flour mixture. Pour the milk in this cavity and begin to stir. The stirring may 
be done with a fork or a spoon. The following directions are for mixing with 
a three-tined fork, as the fork seems to leave the dough lighter and more fluffy 
than a spoon. After the milk has been mixed for the designated amount with 
the flour mixture, remove the ball of dough from the mixing bowl with a 
spatula and place it on a thin layer of flour on a bread board. Handle the dough 
gently and roll it without compressing it in the flour, until the sticky surface 
is covered. Remove to a lightly floured part of the bread board. "Lightly 
floured" means with a very thin layer of flour. Knead the dough gently the 
amount specified and place an embroidery hoop over the dough. Roll and then 
cut with biscuit cutters of the same size for all the experiments. The embroid- 
ery hoop is used so that the biscuit dough will be the same thickness and 



BAKING POWDER BISCUITS 529 

the volume of the biscuits can be compared. Bake at 220° to 230°C. (425° 
to 455 °F.). The dough, instead of being kneaded, can be lightly flattened into 
a square. Fold once and roll. Repeat 3 more times. 

A. To determine the best proportion of liquid for the flour used in this 
experiment. 

Brand of flour used: 

The flours most often used in some sections of the United States are from 
soft-wheat flours. Other sections use bread flour. Since the proportion of 
liquid that gives the best flavor, texture, and the most tender biscuit varies 
with different flours it will be necessary to determine this first. 

Prepare the full recipe. After the fat has been mixed with the flour divide 
into four portions, using 87 grams in each part. 

1. To part one add 61 grams of milk. The water of the milk is equivalent 
to about 70 per cent of the weight of the flour. Stir 30 strokes with a three- 
tined fork. By this time the dough should be in a ball. Remove the dough with 
a spatula, roll in flour, and knead 10 times. Roll and cut. 

2. Repeat 1, but to part two add 55 grams of milk, about 64 per cent 
of liquid. 

3. Repeat 1, but to part three add 51 grams of milk, about 60 per cent. 

4. Repeat 1, but to part four add 47 grams of milk, about 55 per cent of 
liquid. 

B. To determine the amount of manipulation that gives a biscuit of the 
best texture and volume for a drop biscuit. 

1. Prepare Yt, of the recipe. Use a tartrate baking powder. Use the propor- 
tion of milk found best under A. Mix 20 strokes with a three-tined fork. 
Remove 30 grams of the dough, weighing on a piece of wax paper and then 
remove to the baking sheet. 

2. Mix the remaining dough from 1 a total of 25 strokes. Remove 30 grams 
for a biscuit. 

3. Mix the remaining dough from 2 a total of 30 strokes. Remove 30 grams 
of dough for one biscuit. 

4. Mix the remaining dough from 3 a total of 35 strokes. Remove 30 grams 
for a fourth biscuit. 

5. Mix the remaining dough from 4 a total of 100 strokes. Bake 30 grams 
for a fifth biscuit. 

C. Repeat B, but use a phosphate baking powder. 

D. Repeat B, but use S.-P. baking powder. 

E. To determine the amount of manipulation to give a rolled biscuit of the 
best volume and texture. 

al. Prepare ^ of the recipe, using the proportion of milk found best under 
A. Mix 30 strokes with a threc-tined fork. Remove to the bread board. 
Divide into thirds. Knead ^ of the dough lightly 10 times, place an em- 
broidery hoop over the dough, roll and cut. 

2. Knead Y^ of the dough from 1, 20 times, roll and cut. 

3. Knead Yi o^ the dough from 1, 30 times, roll and cut.

1. Prepare ^ of the recipe. Use the proportion of milk found best under 
A and the amount of mixing found best under E. 

2. Repeat Fl, but decrease the fat to 37.5 grams for the full recipe. 

3. Repeat Fl, but increase the fat to 75 grams for the full recipe. 

Section F can be repeated and such different kinds of fat as butter, lard, 
hydrogenated lard, hydrogenated cottonseed oil, and oil used. 

G. To determine the best temperature for baking biscuits when different 
types of baking pow^ders are used. 

1. Prepare ^ of the recipe. Use the proportion of milk found best under 
A, and the amount of mixing found best under E. Use a tartrate baking 
powder. Divide the dough into three biscuits and bake one at 190° to 195°C. 
(375° to 385°F.), one at 220° to 225°C. (425° to 435°F.), and one at 
240° to 250°C. (465° to 480°F.). 

2. Repeat Gl, but use a phosphate baking powder. Do the results under C 
indicate that the amount of mixing should be changed for a phosphate baking 
powder? 

3. Repeat Gl, but use S.-P. powder. Should the amount of mixing be 
increased for this type of baking powder? See D. 

Which proportion of milk gives the best volume and the best texture? Would 
this be the best proportion for all kinds and grades of flour? Why? Might 
there be slight differences in the hydration capacity of the same flour at vari- 
ous times of the year? Why? Should you use more or less water in biscuits 
to produce the same result when water is substituted for milk? Why? What 
amount of mixing gives the best texture with each baking powder? What is the 
effect of kneading upon the texture? Is It desirable? What amount of knead- 
ing and stirring gives the best texture for the flour you are using? Which 
proportion of fat produces the best flavor and texture? If the amount of fat 
in the recipe Is Increased, should the liquid be increased or decreased? Do 
you find much difference In the baking temperatures required for the dif- 
ferent baking powders? Theoretically, which temperature should be best for 
each powder? 

Results and conclusions. 

Suggestions for Additional Experiments for Biscuits 

1. Repeat A, B, and E with a different type of flour, i.e., soft- instead of 
hard-wheat or vice versa; whole-wheat or part whole-wheat and part white 
flour. 

2. Repeat A, B, and E with sour milk or water. 

3. Use the different types of baking powders and hold biscuits in the re- 
frigerator for several hours before baking. 

4. Increase the baking powder In the recipe to 14, 16, or 18 grams. Does It 
Improve the texture? The flavor? 



PLAIN CAKE 531 

Plain Cake 
Experiment 84. 

To determine the factors that affect the texture and flavor of plain cake. 
Plain cake recipe: 

Butter }4 cup 112 grams Family flour 2% cups 300 grams 
Sugar 1 cup 200 grams or 

Eggs 2 96 grams Cake flour 3 cups 300 grams 

Milk 1 cup 244 grams Baking powder 10 grams 

Salt yi teaspoon 2 grams 

Pastry or soft-wheat flour may be used instead of the all-purpose hard-wheat 
flour. Flavoring is added during creaming for home use, but may be omitted 
for experimental work. Stirring is going round and round the mixing bowl, 
either rapidly or slowly; beating is pulling the utensil across the contents of 
the mixing bowl. The directions for all the mixing are for stirring. If the 
class decides to beat the batter instead of stirring, this should be understood 
before starting the mixing so that all will use uniform methods. Bake at 
185°C. (365°F.). 

A. To determine the amount of mixing that gives the best texture for a 
plain cake with different types of baking powders. 

1. Use a tartrate baking powder. 
Brand of baking powder used: 

Pans. Pans 5 by 2^ by 2^ inches, and 2 cups' capacity, are a good size for 
1/6 of the above recipe. If larger or smaller pans are used, prepare the pro- 
portion of the recipe needed for the size of the pan. Muffin pans may be used. 
If they are medium size and 60 grams of batter are used for each cake, only 
Yz of the recipe should be prepared. Line the bottom of the pan with wax or 
heavy plain paper. Grease the paper on the side next to the batter. The sides 
of the pan do not need greasing. 

Prepare the whole recipe. Sift the baking powder with the flour 2 times. 
It can be sifted on squares of paper or in bowls. It is preferable to have 
Incubated the ingredients or put them in the room previous to starting work 
so that their temperature is about 25° to 27°C. If this is not possible, place 
the butter over warm, not hot, water and stir while softening it. Since the fat 
alone does not hold much air when stirred or creamed but does hold air after 
the sugar is added, some sugar should be added at the start of the creaming 
process. If creaming is done on a machine, add all the sugar to the fat at 
first, in order to standardize the procedure. Creaming is more rapid when 
done by hand, if the sugar is added gradually. Cream until light and fluffy. 
Add the well-beaten eggs and mix thoroughly. Add all the flour and all the 
milk to the butter mixture. Begin to stir; notice any changes that occur in the 
batter while stirring. Stir 50 strokes. Remove 150 grams of the batter and 
weigh into a cake pan. Note the position of the batter that drops from the 
edge of the spoon in relation to the pan in the last cakes. Do any tunnels 
develop at these spots in the cakes? 

2. Stir the batter remaining from 1 a total of 150 strokes. Notice any 
changes in the batter. Use 150 grams of batter for the second cake.

6. Use 16 grams of baking powder for the full recipe. 

b. Repeat section D,a, using a phosphate baking powder. 

c. Repeat section D,a, using an S.-P. baking powder. 

Which amount of powder produces the best-textured cake with a tartrate, 
phosphate, and S.-P. baking powder respectively? Do all members of the class 
agree on which amount is preferable? Might the optimum amount vary with 
the maker's technic? With other factors? Enumerate. What is the effect on 
volume, texture, velvetiness, and crumbliness of cake of a small amount of 
powder? Of the large amounts? Which amounts of baking powder yield cakes 
that stale rapidly? 

E. To determine the effect of varying the temperature of baking and the 
method of combining ingredients for a plain cake. 

Prepare ^4 or the proportion of recipe desired. Increase the sugar to 1^ 
cups. Use 225 strokes for combining the flour and milk with the creamed 
mixture. For % the recipe, 235 grams of batter should be weighed into the 
baking pan; for 1/6 use 150 grams. Use the proportion of baking powder 
found best under D, but use the same kind of powder for all of section E. 

1. Conventional method. Cream enough butter, sugar, and eggs for 3 cakes. 
Add the sugar gradually to the butter, and cream thoroughly. Add the beaten 
egg and mix until light and fluffy. Divide into 3 equal parts. If using % the 
recipe, weigh out 124 grams for each cake unless a smaller amount is neces- 
sary to divide the creamed mixture evenly. 

\a. To part 1 of the creamed mixture add the flour by method a given 
under D. 

\b. To the second part add the flour by method b under D. 
\c. To the third part add the flour by method c under D. 

2. Muffin method. Sift the baking powder and the flour together 2 times. 
Use melted butter. Beat the egg. Combine the liquid ingredients. Add dry 
ingredients to the liquid ones and mix 225 strokes. 

3. Separating the yolk and white of the egg. Prepare ^ or proportion of 
recipe desired. Separate the white and yolk of the egg. Cream the butter and 
sugar thoroughly. Add the yolks to the creamed butter and mix until light 
and spongy. Sift the baking powder and flour together 2 times. Add the flour 
and milk according to method c under section D, but stir only a total of 160 
strokes after adding the flour and 195 after adding the last of the milk. Add 
the beaten egg white and fold 30 strokes with a spatula or stir with the spoon. 
Divide into three cakes, using equal weights of batter for each cake. Bake one 
at 185°C. (365°F.), the second at a lower temperature, and the third at a 
higher temperature. 

4. Cake-mixer method. Cream butter, sugar, and egg for 3 cakes. Have the 



534 BATTERS AND DOUGHS 

butter room temperature or about 25°C. Add the sugar and well-beaten egg, 
and cream until very light and spongy. Sift the flour and baking powder 
together 2 times. Divide the creamed mixture into three equal parts. 

4a. To part 1 of the creamed mixture add the flour by method a under 
section D. 

4b. To part 2 add the flour by method b under section D. 

4c. To part 3 add the flour by method c under section D. 

5. Emulsion method. Beat the egg slightly. Melt the butter carefully so 
that it does not reach a high temperature. Add a few drops of the melted 
butter to the egg and beat with an egg beater. After the emulsion is started 
add more butter. The butter is added to the egg in the same manner as in 
making mayonnaise. After the butter is added to the egg add the sugar grad- 
ually. Sift the baking powder and flour together 2 times. Add the flour and 
milk by method a, b, or c under section D. 

6. Conventional-sponge. Prepare ^ or proportion of recipe desired. Cream 
>4 of the sugar and fat thoroughly. Add a tablespoon of flour, with which the 
baking powder has been sifted 2 times, and fold 20 times. Add >^ of the 
remaining flour and Yz of the milk and stir 75 additional strokes or a total 
of 95. Repeat, adding the rest of the flour and milk. Total strokes 170. Beat 
the egg, adding the remaining sugar gradually, until mixture Is very light and 
looks like sponge cake batter. Combine quickly with the cake batter using 55 
strokes, making a total of 225 strokes after starting to add the flour. 

7. Repeat E6 using melted butter or oil, or both. In addition a soft lard 
may be used. For fats other than butter increase the salt to 4 grams. 

8. When an oil or soft fat is used, a much better texture is obtained if the 
egg goes into the cake batter late in the mixing process, for less fat is emulsi- 
fied as an oil-in-water emulsion. Increase the salt to 4 grams for fats other 
than butter. Some other methods that may be tried are: 

a. Combine by any method desired but add the thoroughly beaten whole 
egg last. 

b. Combine the egg with the milk. 

Which method of mixing gives the best cake? Is one method of adding the 
flour preferable to another? Which method of adding the flour is quickest and 
easiest? Should cakes made with different fats always be combined by the con- 
ventional method or can different methods be used to advantage for some fats 
and oils? Is there any advantage in separating the yolk and white of the egg in 
a plain cake? 

F. To determine the effect of varying the proportion of the ingredients in 
the plain cake recipe upon texture, volume, and flavor. 

Prepare the full recipe unless otherwise indicated. Cream by the method 
decided upon by the class. Follow directions under A. Use a tartrate baking 
powder and divide the batter into six cakes of 150 grams each. Notice any 
changes occurring in the batter during mixing. 

1. Increase the eggs in the recipe to 4. Prepare Yz the recipe, using a total 
of 100, 150, and 200 strokes respectively for the three cakes. 

2. Repeat Fl, but separate the yolk and white of the egg. Add the beaten 
white with the flour and milk. 

3. Increase the sugar in the recipe to U^ cups.

Chocolate Cake 
Experiment 85. 

A. To determine the amount of mixing to give the best texture and the 
best method of mixing for a rich chocolate cake. 
Recipe:^ 



Butter 


\yi cups 


280 grams 


Baking powder 


16 grams 


Sugar 


2X cups 


450 grams 


Vanilla 


1 teaspoon 


Eggs 


4 


192 grams 


Salt 


2 grams 


Chocolate 


4 squares 


113 grams 






Cake flour 


3 cups 


300 grams 






Milk 


1 cup 


244 grams 







Sift the flour and baking powder together 2 times for all the following 
experiments. 

1. Mix by any of the methods given below, but it will be necessary to add 
all the flour and milk at one time. The full recipe will make 10 cakes of 
150 grams each, so that portions of the batter may be removed after stirring 
50, 100, 150, 200, 250, 300, 350, 400, 500, and 1000 strokes. For high altitudes 
the proportion of fat, sugar, and baking powder may need to be reduced. 

2. Conventional method. Prepare % of the recipe. Cream the butter, flavor- 
ing, salt, and sugar until very light and spongy. Add the beaten egg and 
mix until very fluffy. Melt the chocolate carefully over warm water. Do not let 
it get too hot, as it should not melt the butter. Add to the butter mixture 
and stir thoroughly. For adding the flour and milk follow directions under 
Experiment 84D, method a, b, or c, but mix a total of 350 strokes or the 
number found best under 85,1. For a loaf cake a pan with a top 8 by 4, 
bottom 7^ by 3^4) and a depth 2^ inches, of 5 cups' capacity will be needed 
for y^ of the recipe. For a layer cake a pan 7 by 7 and 2^ inches deep will 
be satisfactory. Bake at 195° to 200°C. (about 385° to 400°F.). 

3. Muffin method. Put the softened butter, the melted chocolate, the sugar, 
flavoring, and beaten egg in the mixing bowl. Add the flour and milk and stir 
500 times. If the other ingredients are too cold the melted chocolate will not 
blend and may be in flakes in the mixture. On the other hand, if the butter 
and melted chocolate are very warm they raise the temperature of the other 
ingredients, the gluten develops rapidly and the cake is more rubbery and 
tough. 

4. Cake-mixer method. Combine the butter softened sufliciently to cream, 
the sugar, and the beaten egg. Mix thoroughly until light and spongy. Add 
the melted chocolate; see 85,2, for directions for melting the chocolate. Add 
the flour and milk to the batter according to directions given under 85,2. 

5. Use the conventional-sponge method. See Experiment 84, E6. 

B. Temperature of baking. 

Prepare the full recipe, using the method of mixing decided upon. Divide 
into 6 cakes using 235 grams in each cake. Bake 1 cake at 165°C., 1 at 175°C., 
1 at 185°C., 1 at 195°C., 1 at 205°C., and 1 at 215°C.

quantities to determine the optimum quantity. 

Compare the appearance, shape of top, volume, and texture of the cakes 
made by the different methods. Is there any difference in tenderness? Is the 
texture of a rich chocolate cake better, if the butter and sugar are thoroughly 
creamed? Which method requires the shortest time for mixing? Did the in- 
gredients of your cake have a high or a low temperature while mixing? Is the 
flavor improved by adding soda? Do different brands of chocolate produce 
the same color? The same flavor? What is the effect of different types of 
baking powder on the color of the cake ?

Salt 


^2 teaspoon 


Milk 


1 cup 


244 grams 






Egg whites 


6 


180 grams 







1. Conventional method. Prepare 1/6 of the recipe. The amount of mixing 
to give the best texture varies with the kind of flour used and may need to 
be determined. The butter is creamed, and the sugar added gradually to it. 
Add the salt and the flavoring. Sift the baking powder and the flour together 
several times. Add approximately ^ of the flour and 3^ of the milk. Stir 
100 strokes. Add a second portion of flour and milk, stirring a total of 200 
strokes. Add the remainder of the flour and milk, stirring a total of 350 
strokes. The egg whites are beaten until they flow slowly when the bowl is 
partially inverted. They are then added to the cake mixture and folded in 
with 50 folds, using a spatula. Weigh 200 grams of batter into a pan of 
2y2 cups' capacity. Bake at 185°C. (365°F.). 

2. Repeat 1, but fold the egg whites 100 times. 

3. Repeat 1, but stir instead of folding the egg whites into the batter. 

4. Partially cream the butter. Then add the sugar and unbeaten egg white. 
Beat until light and creamy. It is not necessary to cream the butter by this 
method, but the creaming lightens the color of the butter and thus a whiter 
cake is obtained. If the butter is not creamed the only difference is in the 
color, provided the sugar, butter, and tgg white are thoroughly creamed. Add 
the salt, flavoring, flour, and milk according to directions given under 86,1, 
mixing a total of 400 strokes. 

5. Thoroughly cream the butter, sugar, salt, and flavoring. Sift the flour 
and baking powder together several times. Add approximately ^ of the flour, 
Yz of the milk, and ^ of the beaten egg white. Stir 100 strokes. Add another 
Yi of the flour, milk, and the beaten egg white. Stir a total of 200 strokes. 
Add the remainder of the flour, milk, and egg white. Stir a total of 400 strokes. 

Compare the appearance of the crust, the volume, the texture, the tenderness, 
and the flavor of the cakes. Which method gives the greatest volume? The 
most tender cake? What is the effect of folding the egg white too long? Which 
method is the easiest to prepare?

CHAPTER XIII 
FATS AND OILS 

The principal uses of fats and oils in cookery are as follows: ( 1 ) to give 
richness and flavor, as the addition of fat to vegetables, and in mayon- 
naise and French dressings; (2) for sauteing and for cooking foods in deep 
fat; (3) for shortening, as in biscuits, muffins, cakes, and pastries. For the 
first use, flavor is important and may be the deciding factor, unless cost 
needs to be considered. Examples of this are butter or bacon fat for 
vegetables in preference to lard or Crisco, and olive oil for salad dressings 
in preference to other oils. This is a matter of personal choice. For the 
latter two uses, not only the flavor but also the chemical and physical 
characteristics may to some extent be deciding factors as to the preferable 
fat to use. 

True fats and oils are composed of hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen, 
though certain fat derivatives, the lipins, contain either nitrogen or nitrogen 
and phosphorus. 

Properties o£ fats and oils. One characteristic of fats and oils that 
may be an advantage or disadvantage in food preparation is that they 
are excellent solvents for many aromatic compounds. They are solvents 
for odors of onions, fish, perfumes, and many of the aromatic flavors used 
for seasoning food. Onions, celery, parsley, etc., may be cooked in fat, 
and this fat stored in the refrigerator to use in seasoning sauces, meats, etc. 
This can save many preparations of small amounts of onion or other 
vegetables used for seasoning. Perhaps the enhanced flavor when fat is 
added to the fruit filling of pies is partially due to the fat retaining more 
of the aromatic flavor of the fruit as well as to the enriching of the filling. 
Because the fat is a good solvent for vanilla and other flavor, it is often 
advised that it be added to the fat during creaming in mixing cake. 

The fats, the fatty acids, and the soaps formed from the fatty acids 
and alkalies all lower the surface tension of water. 

Fats and oils are only sparingly soluble in alcohol, but are readily soluble 
in ether, chloroform, carbon tetrachloride, etc. Fats and oils are insoluble 
in water. They have a greasy feel and produce characteristic transparent 
spots on paper. 

Specific gravity of fats and oils. All the naturally occurring fats 
and oils have a specific gravity of less than 1.0. The term specific gravity is 
used to denote the ratio between the weight of a substance and the weight 
of an equal volume of water. Usually the weights are compared at the 
same temperature. Thus if the specific gravity of an oil is given as 0.919 

542 



GLYCERIDES 



543 



at 25°/25°C. It means that the weight of the oil at 25° is compared with 
the weight of an equal volume of water at 25 °C. Fats and oils are lighter 
than water, and if they are poured into water they float on its surface. 
Cream has a higher fat content than milk and is lighter than the milk. 
The average specific gravity of some edible fats and oils is given below. 

Butter not less than 0.905 at 40740°C. 

Cottonseed oil about 0.917-0.918 at 25725°. 

Corn oil about 0.919-0.921 at 25725°. 

Lard about 0.931-0.932 at 15°/15°. 

Olive oil about 0.916-0.918. 

Distinction between fats and oils. One distinction between fats and 
oils is that at ordinary temperatures, 18° to 24°C., the fats are solid 
and the oils are liquid. Chemically the fats contain higher percentages 
of the saturated glycerides than the oils, and the oils contain more of 
the unsaturated glycerides than the fats. 

Glycerides. Fats and oils are esters of glycerol and fatty acids, and thus 
are often spoken of as glycerides. Glycerol is a trihydric or triatomic 
alcohol and as such combines with three fatty acids to form a molecule 
of fat or oil. Of the three fatty acids which combine with glycerol to 
form the molecule of fat or oil, all may be the same acid. If, for example, 
the three are stearic acid, the name of the glyceride is tristearin. Two of 
the acids may be the same and the third different. If the molecule con- 
tains two stearic and one palmitic acid, it is known as distearo-palmitin. 
Each of the three may be a different acid. This gives many possible com- 
binations in fats and oils. 

The approximate percentage of the unsaturated glycerides in some of 
the fats and oils used in cooking is given in Table 59.

544 FATS AND OILS 

Since the above figures are approximate, it follows that individual sam- 
ples of each oil or fat vary slightly, some having a higher and some a low^er 
percentage of unsaturated glycerides. Lard obtained from leaf fat has a 
lower percentage of unsaturated glycerides than that obtained from the 
back fat of the same animal. In addition, the composition of such fats as 
butter, lard, tallow, and chicken fat may be influenced by the diet. Pork 
fed soybeans or peanuts in sufficient quantity produces the so-called "soft 
pork," because the body fat contains a higher percentage of unsaturated 
glycerides, hence is softer at room and refrigerator temperatures. 

Melting point o£ fats. Because of the mixture of glycerides the 
melting points of fats are not constant but vary. The melting points of fats 
are not only affected by the percentage of their component unsaturated fatty 
acids but also by the length of the saturated acid chains. The shorter 
saturated fatty acids have lower melting points than the longer ones, and, in 
general, the fats composed of glycerides containing a high percentage of 
the higher or longer chained saturated fatty acids have the highest melting 
points; those with a high percentage of the shorter saturated fatty acids 
have intermediate melting points; and those with a high percentage of 
unsaturated acids have the lowest melting point. As the percentage of the 
shorter fatty acids or the unsaturated fatty acids is increased the melting 
point of the fat is lowered. Butter produced in summer has a lower melting 
point than butter produced in the winter months because the percentage 
of unsaturated fatty acids is higher in the summer. The oils have a higher 
percentage of oleic acid and consequently have a low melting point. Hard 
fats like mutton tallow contain high percentages of palmitic and stearic 
acids and little oleic and have a high melting point. Soft fats like lard con- 
tain more oleic acid than tallow but not so much as the oils. 

Congealing point. The solidifying point of a glyceride or a mixture 
of glycerides is lower than the melting point, the difference in the two 
often being great. For example, Bloor cites the melting point of a sample 
of tristearin as 71.5°C., whereas the solidifying point was 52.5°C. A sample 
of butter melted at 34.5° but congealed at 22.7°C. This wide spread in 
melting and congealing points has some advantages and some disadvantages. 
When melted fats are added to a batter or other product they do not 
solidify as rapidly as they would if the melting and congealing points were 
the same. On the other hand, butter once melted requires a lower tempera- 
ture to congeal. 

Iodine number (or value). The iodine number is defined as the 
number of grams of iodine absorbed by 100 grams of fat or other substance. 
The iodine is absorbed by the unsaturated carbons or at the double bonds. 
The class to which an oil belongs is indicated by its iodine number. The 
non-drying oils, such as peanut and coconut, have iodine values less than 
100. Cacao butter and the fats such as lard, beef, and mutton tallows, and 
butter also, have iodine values below 100. The semi-drying oils, which 
include corn, cottonseed, sesame, wheat, oat, rice, rye, Brazilnut, raisin 
seed, peach, cherry, and apricot kernels, and many others, have iodine 



TEXTURE AND CONSISTENCY OF FATS 545 

values between 100 and 130. Drying oils, which include linseed and soy- 
bean, have iodine values above 130. 

Acid value. Acid value is defined as the number of milligrams of 
KOH required to neutralize the free fatty acids in one gram of substance. 
It is a measure of the quantity of free fatty acids or those not combined in 
glycerides and is usually reported as "free fatty acids as oleic." 

Refractive index. The refractive index is the degree of deflection 
caused in a ray of light in passing from one transparent medium to an- 
other. For some fats the iodine value may be calculated with a fair degree 
of accuracy from the refractive index. Since the determination can be made 
rapidly, the refractive index is used to determine the extent of hydrogena- 
tion during the hydrogenation process. 

Peroxide value. The peroxide value is the amount of peroxide present 
per 1000 grams of fat. It is expressed as milli-equivalents or as milli-moles, 
1 milli-mole equaling 2 milli-equivalents. The peroxide is determined in 
accelerated tests to learn the relative induction periods or relative keeping 
quality of fats. King, Roschem, and Irwin describe the principle of this 
test as follows : By aerating a sample of fat in a test tube held at constant 
temperature in a bath, the aging of the fat is greatly accelerated. They 
state that the temperature at which the fat is held, the surface exposed, 
the amount of oxygen available, the amount of agitation, and the presence 
or absence of light, all have a bearing on the peroxide value. When these 
conditions are controlled, an accelerated test may be completed in a short 
time. The aging of the fat under these conditions is as rapid in a few hours 
as in a few weeks or months when stored at lower temperatures with 
exclusion of light and air. 

Hydrogenation. Hydrogenation is the process by which hydrogen is 
added to the unsaturated carbon bonds of oils, thus forming hard fats. 
By using a metal catalyst, such as iron, copper, nickel, or platinum, at 
an elevated temperature in the presence of an atmosphere of hydrogen 
the oils take up hydrogen at their unsaturated bonds, becoming plastic, 
or hard, brittle fats, depending upon the completeness of hydrogenation. 
Crisco and Snowdrift, hydrogenated fats in common use in food prepara- 
tion, are not completely hydrogenated. They contain about 25 per cent 
of the saturated fatty acids. If they were completely hydrogenated the 
product would be too hard to use in food preparation. In addition to oils or 
mixtures of oils some soft lards are also hydrogenated for edible purposes. 

Texture and consistency o£ fats. The texture or consistency of a 
fat, and hence its properties in baked products, is not only influenced by its 
component glycerides, but also by the rate of cooling and mechanical agita- 
tion. For example, if a sample of lard is divided into two parts, and one 
portion is cooled slowly, i.e., kept in a warm room or an incubator just 
below the congealing point of the fat, the glycerides with high melting 
points tend to crystallize and separate from those with low melting points. 
As a result the crystallized glycerides form granular spots surrounded by 
oil. If the second portion of lard is chilled rapidly, there are fewer granules 



546 



FATS AND OILS 



and the fat is not so grainy. If in addition to rapid chilling, the fat is also 
stirred while it is being cooled it becomes very smooth. If the temperature 
to which it is cooled is several degrees below its melting point the fat may 
become waxy and so firm that it is rather difficult to cream at ordinary 
temperatures. The oil does not separate from the smooth fat as the fat 
becomes soft. It is for this reason that only smooth lard or fat is sold in 
paper cartons. Grainy lard may be purchased but comes in metal contain- 
ers. The commercial smooth lards are not cooled sufficiently to become 
waxy. 

Fatty acids commonly found in foods. The fatty acids commonly 
found combined with the glycerol in food and cooking fats are palmitic, 
stearic, and oleic. Chemically the fatty acids of the acetic acid series have 
the general formula C/zH2«02. The most important of this series in foods 
are the palmitic and stearic, though butyric and caproic, with small amounts 
of caprylic and capric, form about 7 per cent of the glycerides of butter.

Linolic acid belongs to the fatty acid series with the general formula 
CnH2n-402. Linolic and linolenic acids are very important because they 
are necessary for proper functioning of the body, and the animal body 
does not have the ability to synthesize the unsaturated fatty acids. Linolic 
acid contains two double bonds. 

Linolenic acid belongs to the series CnH2n-602 and contains three double 
bonds. 

When oils or fats are hydrogenated, it is generally agreed that the more 
highly unsaturated acids are the first to become saturated. 

Though present in only small amounts both linolic and linolenic acids 
may influence the properties of foods. Their effect, or the effect of their 
oxidation products, on gluten quality has been considered. The glycerides 
with more than one double bond also oxidize readily. The shortening power 
of a fat or oil because of the number of double bonds it contains is still 
to be discussed. 

Glycerol. Glycerol or glycerin and fatty acids are formed by hydrolysis 
of the fats by enzymes during digestion or by saponification, i.e., hydrolysis 
by alkalies. Glycerine has the ability to retain moisture to a high degree, 
being more hygroscopic than the levulose compounds. It has long been 
used by many European bakers to retain the moisture in cakes, cookies, etc.

glycerol acrolein water 

Heat decomposition products o£ glycerol. Some free and uncom- 
bined fatty acids and glycerol are usually found with the fats. When heated 
to a high enough temperature the glycerol decomposes, losing two mole- 
cules of water and forming acrolein. Acrolein is an aldehyde that has a 
sharp odor and is irritating to mucous membranes of the nose and throat 
and to the eyes. The odor and irritation are familiar to all who have 
had experience with "burning fats." 



548 



FATS AND OILS 



Free fatty acids. The amount of free fatty acids found in some fats 
and oils is greater than in others. As previously stated, upon hydrolysis, 
which may be brought about by enzymes, the lipases, or by boiling with 
alkali, fats and oils split into glycerol and fatty acids. In cooking materials 
in fat, particularly foods with considerable water content, the percentage 
of free fatty acids is increased. During heating in the presence of moisture 
some hydrolysis occurs, yielding glycerol and free fatty acids. 



The Smoking Temperatures of Fats 

When fats or oils are heated to a high temperature decomposition occurs 
and finally a point is reached at which visible fumes are given off. This 
point is called the smoking temperature. Some fats decompose at lower 
temperatures than others; those that smoke at low temperatures are not 
pleasant to use because of the odor and irritating effect of the fumes. The 
decomposition also gives an unpleasant and disagreeable flavor to the food. 
Therefore, it is preferable to use fats with high smoking temperatures 
for sauteing and deep fat frying. 

Blunt and Feeney investigated the smoking temperatures of edible fats. 
They found the smoking temperatures of various fats when tested in a 
small evaporating dish having a diameter of about 3^ inches to be as 
follows :

The following factors cause variations in the smoking temperatures of 
fats and oils: (1) the amount of free fatty acids present, (2) the surface 
exposed, and (3) the presence of foreign particles. 



TYPES OF FAT SPOILAGE 549 

Free fatty acids and smoking temperature. Blunt and Feeney have 
determined the amount of free fatty acids in the fats they used and report 
as shown in Table 60 that the fats with the highest percentage of free 
fatty acids have the lowest smoking points, from which they decide that 
the smoking temperature of the fat is closely dependent upon its acidity. 
To confirm this they removed the free fatty acid from some of the olive 
oil and found its smoking point to be 234°C. and its free acid, as oleic, 
0.03 per cent. To some of the cottonseed oil, oleic acid in different pro- 
portions was added, its smoking temperature being lowered with the in- 
creased oleic acid content. 

Surface exposed. They report that the smoking temperature for a 
particular fat is lowered when the surface exposed is increased. Thus the 
wider the diameter of the cooking utensil used, the more the smoking 
temperature is lowered. They advise using a vessel with as small a diameter 
as is convenient for deep fat frying. 

Foreign particles. They have found that another factor that lowers 
the smoking temperature is the presence of finely divided foreign particles 
in the fat. Flour and small particles of other materials accumulate in a 
fat used for cooking purposes. Hence, a much-used fat has a lower smoking 
temperature than the original fat. 

Smoking temperature and fat absorption. The cooperators in fat 
investigations at Iowa State College found that absorption of fat by dough- 
nuts is influenced to a greater degree by the smoking point of the fat than 
by any other chemical or physical factors investigated. Fat absorption was 
greater the lower the smoking point of the fat or oil. 

Rancidity 

Fats are added directly to many products such as crackers, cookies, and 
cake because of their shortening power; they are added to other products 
in the form of such ingredients as nut meats, coconut, fatty seeds, milk, 
and cheese. Prevention of rancidity may become a problem in such baked 
goods as crackers, cookies, and fruit cake which may be stored for longer 
or shorter periods; in the cereal industry; in the confectionery industry; 
in dairy products; in the fat and oil industry; in salad dressings; and in 
storage of meats, particularly cured meats such as bacon and ham, and in 
stored frozen fresh meats. Meat, the fat of which contains more unsaturated 
glycerides, is subject to the development of rancidity more rapidly than fat 
containing greater percentages of saturated glycerides. Thus frozen poultry 
and pork present more problems when stored for long periods than beef 
and mutton. 

Types of fat spoilage. The chemical change that needs to occur in a 
fat before taint is detectable organoleptically is very small. Davies states 
that butyric and capric acids are detectable by smell and taste in concentra- 
tions of less than 80 parts per million parts of fat. Changes in fats can be 



550 FATS AND OILS 

detected by smell and taste before they can be detected by chemical tests. 
An isolated fat possessing excellent keeping qualities may show deteriora- 
tion rapidly after it is combined with other ingredients, and vice versa ; 
but, in general, the fresher the fat and the better its keeping quality, the 
better the keeping quality of the product with which it is combined. 

Different types of spoilage may occur in fats. Davies says "mustiness" 
is due to microorganic breakdown of higher fatty acids and is accelerated 
by moisture. Mustiness is common in cereal products, particularly maize. 
Davies states it is accompanied by an increase in acidity of water extracts, 
matting of the product because of mold growth, and local spontaneous 
heating. It is prevented by keeping the humidity sufficiently low. 

"Fishiness," according to Davies, is due to the production of trimethyl- 
amine in the presence of catalysts from lecithin, before the auto-oxidation 
of the fat proper. Fishiness occurs most commonly in butter. The presence 
or absence of other products can alter the fishy odor. 

The term rancidity is used by the homemaker to designate the develop- 
ment of any disagreeable odor and flavor in fats and oils. But in the fat and 
oil industry the term is often restricted to the oxidative changes in fats and 
oils. Different investigators classify the disagreeable odors and flavors ac- 
cording to their production in different ways. Davies gives three types of 
rancidity as follows: (1) acid, (2) oxidative, and (3) ketonic. Triebold's 
classification is (1) hydrolytic, (2) oxidative, and (3) ketonic. 

Hydrolytic rancidity. Hydrolytic or the acid rancidity of Davies is 
brought about by the action of lipase enzymes which by hydrolysis split 
the fat into glycerol and fatty acids. Davies adds that free fatty acids may 
also be liberated by a relatively high hydrogen-ion concentration in contact 
with the fat. Lipases are associated with fats in their natural state, i.e., 
nuts, seeds, milk, and fat of meat. Since lipase enzymes are destroyed by 
heat, this type of rancidity is encountered in products which are not heated 
to a high enough temperature to destroy the enzyme. The flavors developed 
by lipase action depend upon the composition of the fat. Thus flavors caused 
by butyric acid will be found only in products containing butter fat. Davies 
states that lipase activity in itself is of no great economic importance, except 
in the fats rich in the lower fatty acids, but secondary reactions associated 
with oleic acid introduce another aspect. The free fatty acids act as catalysts 
for oxidative changes. Greenbank says that lard with a low free fatty acid 
content keeps well, even when stored for long periods, and butter from 
sweet cream does not become rancid as rapidly as butter from sour cream. 
The better-keeping quality of the sweet-cream butter is attributed to its 
lower free fatty acid content. 

Chemical and physical changes in fats with development o£ 
oxidative rancidity. Among the changes which occur when a fat or oil 
becomes rancid are the following: the iodine value decreases, whereas the 
specific gravity, acid value, and peroxide value increase. Coe states that 
numerous investigations have shown that when an oil or fat is protected 



OXIDATIVE RANCIDITY 551 

« 

from light by means of a green wrapper or container it may have a peroxide 
value equal to or even greater than an unprotected fat that has become 
rancid and still be organoleptically free from rancidity. From this Coe 
concludes that the reaction that gives rise to the rancid taste and odor has 
no connection vrith formation of peroxides. 

Oxidative rancidity. Oxidative rancidity occurs through the taking 
up of oxygen at the double bonds of the unsaturated glycerides. Many 
oxidative decomposition products may be formed, though Kerr states the 
exact nature of these changes is not always clear. These products include 
aldehydes, ketones, fatty acids of lower molecular weight, hydroxy acids, 
oxy acids, and gases. Andrews has reported that among the gaseous decom- 
position products of rancid fats are carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide, hy- 
drogen, nitrogen, oxygen, and other gases. Triebold gives a good summary 
of the products formed in development of rancidity. 

Induction period. There is a period before the uptake of oxygen by a fat 
becomes appreciable which is known as the induction period. During this 
period the fat is still fresh and "sweet." The induction period varies for 
different fats and oils and for different samples of the same fat or oil. But 
oxidation products act as catalysts so that oxygen uptake receives increased 
momentum as these products are formed. Reports in the literature indicate 
that the first compounds formed in oxidation of unsaturated fatty acids are 
not oxides or peroxides. These compounds have never been isolated and 
have been given the name "moloxides." Exclusion of air or oxygen from 
a fat may retard but not inhibit its oxidation. It has been suggested that 
the source of this oxygen is oxygen in loose combination with the fat. It is 
sometimes suggested that loosely bound oxygen is the source of oxygen 
for the moloxides. 

Prooxidants and antioxidants. A prooxidant accelerates but an antioxi- 
dant retards oxidation of a fat. Because of the economical importance of 
prevention of rancidity many investigations have been conducted to find 
physiologically harmless antioxidants. The literature on rancidity is volumi- 
nous and many contradictions occur, particularly in regard to the activity 
of different substances as accelerators or retarders of oxidation. The con- 
tradictions can be attributed to the lack of suitable tests for minute quanti- 
ties of some substances, the different conditions under which the tests are 
made, and the differences in degree of purity or refinement of the fats and 
oils. Fats and oils always contain at least traces of different substances in 
varying proportions, some of which can act as prooxidants and others as 
antioxidants. Patents have been granted for the use of many substances 
as antioxidants. 

Metals. Traces of certain metals (King, Roschem, and Irwin) may act 
as catalysts, copper in particular being an active prooxidant. Tin had the 
least effect of any metals used in the experiments, although the authors 
state the results were not conclusive in that tests were not made under many 



552 FATS AND OILS 

conditions. The effect of metals is important, for in the manufacture, re- 
fining, and storage of fats they come in contact with metals. 

Lecithin. Lecithin, found in egg yolk, soybeans, and other substances 
added to baked products, has been reported to be a powerful antioxidant 
and inactive. Olcott and Mattill say that commercial "lecithin," which is 
not a pure lecithin, has antioxidant action on refined cottonseed oil, little 
effect on lard, and none at all on lard-cod liver oil mixtures. They 
attribute the antioxidant properties to the cephalin found in the commercial 
lecithin. It is well known that egg yolk has antioxidant properties in 
cookies, cakes, and similar products in which both egg yolk and fat are 
used. 

Cereals. Soybean flour (Musher) is said to be strongly antioxidant. Oat, 
corn, barley, or other cereal may be employed but oat flour is preferable 
because of its bland flavor. Wheat flour is a weak retarder of oxidation 
and oat flour is not as strong an antioxidant as soybean flour. 

Effect of inert gases and humidity. Triebold and Bailey found that 
crackers as well as fats stored in an atmosphere of COo were as rancid as 
control samples stored in air. Other investigators have also reported the 
ineffectiveness of COo in retarding the development of rancidity. However, 
storage in an atmosphere of nitrogen or hydrogen retards the development 
of rancidity. 

Triebold and Bailey also found that zero-per cent relative humidity 
favors, but some humidity retards, oxidative rancidity. However, humidity 
as high as 50 to 75 per cent produces mustiness. The 5- to 6-per cent 
moisture content of crackers aids in keeping the crackers fresh. They also 
found that in general the keeping quality of crackers was related to the 
length of the induction period of the shortenings used in them, but several 
outstanding exceptions to this relationship were noted, so that the keeping 
quality was more closely related to the induction period of the crackers 
themselves. 

Antioxidants for fats in contact with water. Lea was interested in find- 
ing antioxidants for bacon fat. He investigated the effect of different sub- 
stances on fat in contact with a brine pickle. His results follow. Oxidation 
of lard in a glass vessel in contact with water is much more rapid at an 
alkaline than at an acid />H. It is suggested that this is due to dissolution 
of copper from the glass. At a /»H below 5, nitrate is a powerful accelerator. 
Copper and iron in aqueous solution accelerate the oxidation of lard, copper 
being approximately 20 times as active as iron. Copper was active in as 
low concentrations as 0.01 p. p.m. Aliphatic polyhydroxy-compounds such 
as glycerol and the sugars are weak antioxidants. Aliphatic hydroxy-acids, 
e.g., lactic and glycoUic, the ethanolamines and maleic acid are moderate, 
and polybasic hydroxy-acids, e.g., tartaric and citric, are powerful anti- 
oxidants. Aliphatic amino-acids, e.g., glycine, aspartic and glutamic acids, 
and asparagine are all powerful antioxidants. Protein has considerable 
antioxidant activity and may be partly responsible for the stabilization of 



EFFECT OF LIGHT, HEAT, AND AIR 553 

crude natural oils and fats. The prooxidant effect of copper at low con- 
centrations (up to approximately 1 p.p.m.) is completely inhibited by 
protein and other antioxidants. At higher concentrations of the metal, even 
4 per cent of protein fails to prevent a powerful acceleration of oxidation. 
Orthophosphoric acid is a fairly good, and pyrophosphoric a very good, 
antioxidant. Phosphorous acid is also effective. These water-soluble anti- 
oxidants still retard oxidation when the water content is as low as 0.25 per 
cent. They are active at />H 7, certainly in more acid and probably in 
more alkaline solutions. 

Volatilization of rancid products. Roschem and Newton found that 
samples of rancid lard blown with steam at 100°C. were odorless, bland- 
tasting, and entirely palatable, i.e., the products causing the rancid flavor 
and odor were volatile. Furthermore these volatile substances had no 
accelerating effect in oxidation of lard. This was interpreted to mean that 
the accelerating effect is due to a substance or substances of heavy molecular 
weight not volatile, with steam distillation at 200°C. and 3 to 5 mm. 
mercury pressure. 

Protective action of green light. Coe and Le Clerc compared the 
inhibiting effect of excluding all light, using only green light of 490 to 
580 m/x wave length or 4900 to 5800 Angstrom units, with the effect of 
several antioxidants, including maleic acid and pyrogallol, upon oxidation 
of fats. They report that oils or fats stored at low temperatures and with 
all light excluded remained fresh longer than if treated with antioxidant 
or packaged in green wrappers and exposed to light at room temperature. 
Packaging in green glass or opaque wrappers was more effective in keeping 
fat fresh than the addition of the antioxidants. Green glass or opaque 
wrappers which exclude all light except the aforementioned wave lengths 
are suitable for packaging nuts, potato chips, or food products for display 
purposes. 

Ketonic rancidity. Davies states this type of fat spoilage is caused 
by molds which attack the short-chained saturated fatty acids, the decom- 
position products producing disagreeable flavors. Since butter and coconut 
oil are the principal fats which contain short-chained acids in the glycerides, 
most ketonic rancidity is confined to these fats. 

Effect of light, heat, and air. It has been known for years that 
exposure of fats to light, heat, and air is deleterious to keeping the fat fresh. 
Greenbank investigated the relative effect of each of these factors. He 
concludes that in the presence of air, light is the most powerful accelerator, 
and moisture and heat follow \n the order given. "This conclusion holds 
only for lower temperatures." A vacuum may retard oxidation but not 
prevent it. 

Triebold and Bailey found that all hydrogenated shortening samples 
stored in unopened containers showed induction periods of approximately 
the same length. Samples from containers once opened and then restored 



554 FATS AND OILS 

had shorter induction periods. A lard sample stored in the laboratory for 
a year with air excluded appeared in as good condition at the end as at the 
start of the experiment. They emphasize the practical importance of pre- 
venting undue exposure of shortenings to air and decreasing the surface 
area of the fat exposed to air. 

Home storage of fats and oils. All the work on development of 
rancidity in fats and oils indicates that the fat should be stored so that 
light is excluded, at a low temperature, and with as little exposure to air 
as possible. For farm storage of lard, when 5, 10, or more gallons are 
stored in one container, the light should be excluded and Triebold and 
Bailey's results suggest a tall narrow container, rather than a wide flat 
one, for the former exposes a smaller surface of the fat to the air. When 
lard is removed from these containers it is preferable to remove a level 
layer rather than to dig out the center portion. 

Changes in Fats during Cooking Processes 

Masters and Smith have investigated the character of the changes in fat 
during cooking. They state that the changes occurring in the fat in cooked 
pastry are slight, unless the pastry is very thin or over-cooked. 

Woodruff and Blunt have reported the changes in fats absorbed by 
potato chips and a dough mixture. They state that the iodine number is 
lowered, and the percentage of free fatty acids increased. These changes 
are not great, but the fat absorbed by the food undergoes greater changes 
than the fat in which the food is cooked. Long cooking or use of the fat 
increases the amount of decomposition of the fat. The higher the tempera- 
ture to which the fat is heated, the greater the decomposition products 
formed. Thus during cooking the fat should not be heated higher than the 
temperature needed for cooking the food. 

Morgan and Cozens found that fats used for frying a standard dough 
showed consistent decreases in iodine number, lowering of the melting 
point and increases in acidity and refractive index. They state that in 
general the increase in acidity is greater in those fats showing the larger 
amounts of absorption. 

King et al. used 9 fats, including 3 kettle-rendered lards from animals 
fed on rations consisting largely of (1) peanut, (2) corn, and (3) brewer's 
rice, a standard prime steam lard, a hydrogenated lard, a hydrogenated 
cottonseed oil, and three highly refined oils from corn, cottonseed, and 
peanuts, respectively, for studying frying of potato chips. The fat absorbed 
by the chips was about the same for all the fats used. Chemical tests 
showed deterioration of all fats. After 10 fryings the fitness of the fats, 
particularly the lards on account of their high peroxide value, for further 
use was questionable. They found no relation between chemical changes 
and the flavor of the chips. The percentage of free fatty acids in the fat 



COMPOSITION AND NATURE OF FOOD 555 

extracted from the chips was greater than in the frying fat. Based largely 
upon desirability of flavor the palatability tests indicated oils were preferable 
to lards for frying potato chips, those fried in peanut oil ranking highest 
with cottonseed oil second. Of the lards, the hydrogenated and that from 
animals whose rations consisted largely of peanuts were considered best. 
Potato chips fried in oils and in most cases those stored in the refrigerator 
kept fresh longest. 

The Amount of Fat Absorbed by Fried Foods 

The chief factors governing the amount of fat which will be absorbed by 
a food during frying are (1) the time of cooking, (2) the temperature of 
the cooking fat, (3) the total surface area of the food, and (4) the com- 
position and nature of the food. 

Time of cooking. In general, it can be stated that the longer the food 
is cooked the greater the fat absorption. There will be some exceptions 
to this. For instance, with some foods cooked at high temperatures, coagu- 
lated material or a hardened crust may prevent greater fat absorption 
with longer cooking. Other foods which contain a high percentage of fat 
like breaded pork chops may lose fat during cooking. This is also true of 
fried chicken, if the chicken has a high fat content. 

Temperature of cooking fat. Usually there is less fat absorption at 
higher cooking temperatures. This is probably due to the quick formation 
of a crust or coagulated material at the high temperature. However, slight 
differences in cooking temperature, 30° to 40°C., cause little variation in 
fat absorption. Ordinarily food is cooked at moderate temperatures to 
thoroughly cook the food without excessive browning. 

Surface area. The larger the surface for a given weight of material 
the greater the area over which fat may be absorbed. Cracks caused by 
handling or expansion in cooking, rolling thin rather than thick, roughened 
surfaces, due to little mixing or other causes, stretching and pulling the 
material out of shape in handling, all increase the surface area and thus 
tend to increase the fat absorption. 

The composition and nature of the food. Some foods by their nature 
tend to absorb more or less fat than others. For example, fried eggs may 
absorb less fat than some foods. This is due to the smooth surface and to 
the coagulation of the egg proteins, which tends to prevent fat absorption. 
Large amounts of flour on the surface of chops may tend to increase the 
fat absorption, owing to the absorption of fat by the flour. Variations in 
composition of the food and variations in the proportion of ingredients 
used in foods cause wide variations in the amount of fat absorbed. A food 
like doughnuts, containing sugar, fat, liquid, eggs, flour, and baking powder, 
may show wide variations in the amount of fat absorbed, even when the 
length of time of cooking and the amount of surface area are kept as 



556 FATS AND OILS 

standardized as possible. Variations in the extent of mixing foods like 
doughnuts produce variations in the amount of fat absorbed during cooking 
because the characteristics of the dough are altered by mechanical treat- 
ment. 

The Amount o£ Fat Absorbed by Doughnuts Reported by 
Different Investigators 

Fat absorption in doughnuts by McKee. McKee has determined 
the amount of fat absorbed in frying doughnuts. The doughnuts were made 
under standard conditions and fried for 5 minutes at 200°C. The standard 
recipe averaged 34.7 per cent fat absorbed. When the fat was doubled 
and quadrupled in the doughnut recipe the fat absorption was increased 
to 43.4 and 47.8 per cent, respectively; sugar doubled caused an increase to 
44.3 per cent. But when the sugar was quadrupled the doughnut dis- 
integrated during cooking, absorbing large quantities of fat. 

Fat absorption in doughnuts. From various sources. Morgan 
and Cozens have determined the amount of fat absorbed in frying dough- 
nuts. Their dough contained less egg and more flour than the dough used by 
McKee. Their doughnuts were larger than McKee's, which gave a rela- 
tively larger surface for a given weight of dough for the McKee doughnut. 
They cooked their doughnuts for 3 minutes at 205° to 210°C., which 
resulted in an average fat absorption of 17.4 per cent. The time of cooking, 
the temperature of the cooking fat, and the proportion of ingredients in 
the recipes used by McKee and Morgan-Cozens were not the same ; hence 
the fat absorption differed. 

The cooperators in lard investigations at Iowa State College Experi- 
ment Station determined the amount of fat absorbed by doughnuts and 
the changes in the fats caused by cooking doughnuts in each fat, the period 
of heating each fat being kept constant at 10j4 hours. These studies were 
continued over a period of 3 years, the same operator, Jensen, making and 
frying all the doughnuts, so that a highly specialized technic was developed. 
Standardized conditions of mixing, which included incubation of all mate- 
rials at a definite temperature before mixing and mixing with a Kitchen- 
Aid, were maintained. Six mixes or batches of dough were required for 
the doughnuts fried in each fat. The term ''firsts" was applied to dough- 
nuts cut after the first rolling of the dough. The scraps were then collected 
and rerolled. The doughnuts from this lot were designated as ''rerolls." 
Again the scraps were collected and rerolled, the doughnuts from this lot 
designated as ''re-rerolls." The following results are from tests during the 
third year only. 

A total of 12 fats were used, of which 2 were open-kettle rendered 
lards, 5 were prime-steam rendered lards, 1 hydrogenated lard, 1 hydro- 
genated cottonseed oil, and 1 corn oil. 



TEMPERATURE OF INGREDIENTS WHEN MIXED 557 

Number of "firsts" cooked in each fat 12 dozen 

Number of "rerolls" cooked in each fat 6 dozen 

Number of "re-rerolls" cooked in each fat 2>^ dozen 

Average fat absorption from all fats for "firsts" 28.6 per cent 

Average fat absorption from all fats for "rerolls" 22.3 per cent 

Average fat absorption from all fats for "re-reroUs" 18.5 per cent 

The analysis of variance indicated exceedingly high uniformity among 
rollings, i.e., "firsts" always absorbed the most fat, etc., but great variation 
among different mixes or batches so that the variation from mix to mix 
was used as the experimental error. The variation of amount of fat absorbed 
by the different fats was also highly significant. Further analysis of the 
data showed a significant negative correlation between the smoking point of 
the fat and the amount of fat absorbed by the doughnuts, which indicated 
that the lower the smoking point the greater the amount of fat absorbed 
by the doughnuts. The iodine value, the percentage of free fatty acids, 
and the refractive index had no effect on the amount of fat absorbed. 
However, a highly significant negative correlation was found between the 
free fatty acids content and the smoking point of the fat which agrees with 
former findings of Blunt and Feeney and Morgan and Cozens. 

Denton and co-workers have also published results for fat absorption in 
doughnuts and other foods. Their conclusions are similar to those of the 
investigators mentioned above and to the following class results, so will 
not be given in detail. 

Factors Affecting the Amount of Fat Absorbed During Cooking 
and the Texture of the Doughnuts 

The factors that affect the amount of fat absorbed by doughnuts may 
be outlined as follows. Other factors than those listed may also affect the 
amount of fat absorbed: (1) surface area, (2) the temperature of the 
ingredients when mixed, (3) the extent of mixing, (4) the kind and brand 
of flour used, (5) the amount of flour, (6) the cooking temperature and 
the length of time of cooking, (7) letting the dough stand before frying, 
and (8) variation in the proportion of ingredients used in the recipe. All 
the above factors either directly or indirectly affect the texture and also the 
tenderness of the doughnuts. 

Surface area. Other things being equal, the greater the surface area 
the greater the fat absorption. The total surface area of doughnuts may be 
increased by stretching the dough in handling and by cracks on the surface 
of the dough. The thicker the doughnut is rolled, the smaller the total 
surface area in proportion to the weight of the doughnut. The thickness 
of the dough in all the following experiments is ^ inch. This is controlled 
by rolling the dough between cleats tacked to a bread board. 

Temperature of ingredients when mixed. The results in Table 61 
show that the temperature of the ingredients when mixed has a decided 



558 



FATS AND OILS 



effect upon the amount of fat absorbed during cooking. The tenderness of 
the doughnuts was as marked as the fat absorption, for all the doughnuts 
of series II were tougher than those of series I. The dough made from the 
materials that had been incubated at 40°C. developed very rapidly, be- 
coming quite elastic and rubbery in a short time. The dough stretched 
yet was so tenacious that it was difficult to divide it. It had a tendency to 
draw up and shrink after rolling. With this temperature even 60 strokes 
was too long to mix the dough to secure tender doughnuts. The best 
temperature of the ingredients to secure doughnuts of desirable texture and 
tenderness is about 22° to 27°C. (72° to 80°F.).

A word of explanation is necessary regarding the percentage of fat 
absorbed. As given in the tables it is only approximate. Doughnuts both 
lose and gain weight during cooking. Moisture is lost and fat is absorbed. 
The only accurate way to obtain the percentage of fat absorbed in dough- 
nuts is to run an analysis on the ingredients used, i.e., to determine the 
amount of fat in the dough and in the cooked doughnuts. This requires 
too long for regular class work. Denton has suggested that the percentage 
of fat be calculated on the weight of the cooked doughnuts, and this has 
been followed in determining the percentage of fat given in the tables. The 
uncooked weight of the doughnuts is also given. 

Extent of mixing. Both the manner of mixing the ingredients and 
the length of time of mixing the dough influence the texture obtained in 
doughnuts. Doughnuts, like cakes, seem to have a finer, more even texture 



TEMPERATURE AND LENGTH OF TIME 



559 



if the eggs are thoroughly creamed with the fat and sugar. Adding the 
flour and milk in different portions may also affect the texture. Too little 
mixing after the flour and liquid are added gives a coarse, harder, rather 
crystalline texture, for the ingredients are not thoroughly blended. With 
over-mixing the doughnuts are tougher and more compact. The tempera- 
ture of the ingredients affects the amount of mixing required to obtain 
a tender doughnut. As the temperature increases less mixing is required; 
at too low a temperature, the fat does not blend with the other ingredients. 
The length of time of mixing the dough also affects the amount of fat 
absorbed by doughnuts. In general, the longer the dough is mixed the more 
the gluten is developed unless mixing is extremely long. The development 
of the gluten by mixing forms thin filaments of gluten throughout the dough 
that probably tend to prevent fat absorption. The longer mixing produces 
a more uniformly mixed dough, which has a smoother crust. The smoother 
crust has less surface for fat absorption than a dough with a rougher 
surface. 

Kind and brand o£ flour used. The amount of fat absorbed by dough- 
nuts varies with the kind or brand of flour used, if other conditions are 
standardized. In general, the strong flours show greater decrease in fat 
absorption with longer mixing. The soft-wheat flours tend to increase the 
fat absorption. The amount of flour, that is of bread or soft-wheat flour, 
to give a soft tender doughnut also varies. This is apart from varying the 
proportion of flour. 

The amount of flour. As the amount of flour in the recipe is increased 
the amount of fat absorbed by the doughnuts is decreased. This is shown 
in Table 62.

The results in Table 63 show less fat absorption at the higher tempera- 
tures. Sometimes the differences are not so great. Extreme temperatures 
were used in these doughnut experiments. In ordinary cooking as low 
a temperature as 155°C. would not be used, for the doughnuts would 
require too long a time to brown. Nor would the high temperature be 
used, for the doughnuts become too brown in a very short time. The 
doughnuts cooked for 2 minutes are not so brown as those cooked 4 
minutes. Those cooked at 155° to 160° are very pale in color; those at 
195° to 200°, except the ones cooked 2 minutes, are too dark in color. 
Usually the preferable color is obtained by cooking at 175° to 180° for 
3 or 4 minutes. The doughnuts cooked at the highest temperature usually 
have a smaller volume than those cooked at 175° to 180°, probably because 
the crust hardens quickly at the higher temperature and thus prevents 
expansion. This would be one factor that causes decreased fat absorption 
at 195° to 200°, as the doughnuts would have less surface area. 

Letting the dough stand before frying. If the dough is allowed 
to stand a short time before frying the amount of fat absorbed while 
cooking is usually lessened, but sometimes just the opposite happens, and 
a larger quantity of fat is absorbed. The volume of the cooked doughnuts 
is usually greater after the dough is allowed to stand a short time. This 
would tend to cause greater fat absorption on account of greater surface 
area.

will be found to vary somewhat. One recipe may contain a larger propor- 
tion of sugar, another of fat. This variation of proportion of ingredients 
will influence the percentage of fat absorbed. 

Sugar. When the sugar in the regular recipe is increased from 1 to 1^ 
cups the dough is quite sticky and difficult to handle. The dough appears 
as if it contained a thick sirup. The fat absorbed during cooking is de- 
cidedly increased. If the dough is mixed longer it becomes less sticky and 
the gluten better developed, and fat absorption is decreased. The result 
upon the texture is similar to that obtained when sugar is increased in 
cake. The dough requires more mixing than the regular recipe to obtain 
good doughnuts. The best texture is usually obtained with 180 to 200 
strokes. 

Fat. When the fat in the recipe is increased the fat absorbed during 
cooking is increased. When the fat in the recipe is increased, the extent of 
mixing does not affect the fat absorption so much, i.e., fat absorption does 
not decrease so rapidly with longer mixing as in the regular recipe. There 
is also the possibility of variation of amount of fat absorbed, when dif- 
ferent kinds of fats, such as butter, Crisco, or lard, are used in the dough. 
When flour is increased, which the homemaker tends to do because in- 
creased fat gives a softer dough, the fat absorption is not always increased 
by doubling the fat in the recipe. 

Egffs. When the number of eggs in the recipe given in the outline is 
increased from 2 to 3, with no other change, the dough is softer and more 
sticky, because of the moisture content of the egg. This tends to cause 
increased fat absorption. The coagulation of the increased egg in the 
crust tends to decrease the fat absorption. The final result is the sum 



562 FATS AND OILS 

of these antagonistic effects. Sometimes one factor and sometimes the other 
predominates. In making doughnuts the tendency would be to add more 
flour to roll the dough more readily, and this would decrease the fat 
absorption. Other factors in addition to the two mentioned above will 
also affect the amount of fat absorbed. These include surface area and the 
extent of mixing. The volume of the doughnuts w^ith increased egg may 
be larger than the volume of those in the regular recipe, giving a greater 
surface area for absorption of fat. Doughnuts made with increased egg 
may contain tunnels, and there is a tendency for them to be tough. 

The Shortening Power of Fats and Oils 

Shortening power has been defined and tested in various ways. The 
ordinary household way is to test the product by feel either by breaking or 
by crushing. Davis has defined shortening as follows: "That material has 
the greatest shortening power, which when baked in a dough under stand- 
ard conditions gives to the product a minimum crushing or a minimum 
breaking strength." Shortening power or the ability of fats and oils to make 
a product more tender so that it breaks or crushes more readily is due to 
several factors. These factors for discussion may be classified as follows: 
(1) differences in structure of the dough, (2) differences in adsorption 
of different fats and oils at interfaces and orientation, and (3) the surface 
area covered by the fat or oil. The author is aware that this classification 
is somewhat superficial, for plasticity, the melting point of the fats used, 
and other factors might be listed. But differences in plasticity of the fats 
used will influence the structure of the dough and thus may be considered 
under the classification given. 

Differences in structure of the dough. In the chapter on batters 
and doughs it was found that differences in structure of batters and doughs 
were due to several causes, i.e., the method of mixing or combining of 
ingredients, the temperature of the ingredients when mixed, the extent 
of mixing, the plasticity of the fat used, the ingredients used, and the 
proportions of these ingredients. It is rather diflficult to exactly duplicate 
the structure of a dough, but it is particularly difficult when the material 
is thin like pastry. The fat or oil is seldom distributed evenly throughout 
the dough. This gives structural weakness in certain areas. For this reason 
breaking tests of individual pastries may vary considerably. 

Theory concerning differences of shortening power of dif- 
ferent fats and oils. The theory for differences in shortening power 
of different fats and oils is based upon the concepts of differences in 
cohesion, adhesion, adsorption at interfaces, and orientation of molecules. 
These are in turn based on the concept of polarity. Polar groups or polar 
molecules, owing to an electric charge, are very reactive and strongly 
attracted to each other. Some substances like fatty acids have polar groups, 
while a portion of the molecule is non-polar. This theory for the shorten- 



UNSATURATED FATTY ACIDS 563 

ing power of fats and oils has been developed from the work of Lang- 
muir, Harkins, and their co-workers, upon cohesion, adhesion, interfacial 
tension, and molecular attraction, between water and organic liquids. 

Langmuir has reported : ''When a small quantity of an oil, such as 
olive oil, is placed upon a large clean surface of water, the oil spreads 
rapidly upon the water surface until a definite area has been covered, and 
then the oil shows little or no tendency to spread further." The following 
is a brief summary of his article. Some portions of the molecule have greater 
affinity for water than other parts. In determining the cause of this spread- 
ing of the oil upon the water he found that the film was one molecule 
thick. If the cause of spreading is an attraction between the oil and water 
this attraction may be the molecule as a whole or certain portions of the 
molecule may have greater attraction than other parts for the water. If 
the whole molecule is attracted there would be solubility of oil in water. 
If a portion of the oil molecule is attracted by the water while another 
portion is more attracted by the oil molecules we have a ready explana- 
tion of the spreading of the oil on the water. 

If oleic acid is considered, as an example, the carboxyl group has a 
strong affinity for water, and when placed on water this group is probably 
absorbed in it. The hydrocarbon chain of oleic acid has no attraction for 
water but it is attracted by other hydrocarbon chains. From this, one can 
picture the hydrocarbon chains as standing in the air side by side and the 
carboxyl group dissolved in the water. Since the hydrocarbon chains have 
an attraction for each other when the amount of oleic acid upon the 
surface of the water is small, there is a tendency for it to remain in a 
globule. This attraction of parts of the molecule for each other is in the 
nature of a chemical force. With very small amounts of oleic acid the 
hydrocarbon chain may lie along the surface of the water. With enough 
for a layer the chains may stand upright. 

The hydrocarbon chain of oleic acid is not a saturated one. It contains 
a double bond. With a limited amount of oil on the surface of the water 
the double bond as well as the carboxyl group may be drawn down onto 
the surface of the water. In this way it covers a larger surface area of 
the water. 

Unsaturated fatty acids cover a larger surface area than satu- 
rated ones. Langmuir has measured the length of the molecules and the 
area of the water covered by them. He reports that the area covered by the 
three saturated acids, palmitic, stearic, and creotic, is practically the same, 
yet the number of carbons in palmitic is 16 and in creotic 26, the latter 
having the longer molecule. The glyceride tristearin covers an area three 
times that of one molecule of stearic acid. From this it is seen that the area, 
covered is the same whether as an acid or as an ester of a glyceride. In 
measuring the height above the surface of the water he found it to be 
the same as the length of the hydrocarbon chains, showing that they are 
packed vertically side by side. The results are probably best told in his 



564 FATS AND OILS 

words. "The unsaturated fatty acids all cover much greater areas per 
molecule than the saturated. The double bond in oleic acid is thus appar- 
ently drawn down onto the water surface. It is interesting to note, however, 
that linoleic acid with its two double bonds, does not cover any greater 
area per molecule than oleic acid. It may be that the double bonds attract 
one another to some extent in place of the water. Linolenic acid, however, 
with three double bonds, covers a considerably greater area than oleic or 
linoleic. As the number of double bonds increases, the energy consumed 
in compressing the film decreases, probably because the carboxyl groups 
tend to be attracted by the double bonds in adjacent molecules and are 
thus more easily separated from the water surface." 

Polar groups of molecules and water are attracted to each other. Harkins 
and co-workers have reported that, if an organic liquid contains polar 
groups in its molecules, these groups turn towards the water, and the 
amount of work required to separate it from the surface of the water is 
greater than when the polar groups are absent. These polar groups are 
substances containing oxygen, nitrogen, sulfur, iodine, bromine, chlorine, 
or double or triple bonds. 

In a later paper Harkins and Cheng have reported that a paraffin with 
a triple bond increases the adhesional work very decidedly; they state: 
''This and other studies in this paper should prove of value in study of 
lubrication and other adhesional phenomena." 

Wilson and Barnard have reported that a good lubricant is one that 
has the property of "oiliness." They define oiliness as "The property by 
virtue of which one fluid gives lower coefficients of friction (generally at 
slow speeds or high loads) than another fluid of the same viscosity." 

Orientation in lubricants. Wilson and Barnard, with other investi- 
gators, find the "animal and vegetable oils to be superior in oiliness to 
straight mineral oils." They conclude that the property of oiliness is due 
to selective adsorption of parts of the oil by the metal surface so that they 
adhere closely and are not squeezed out from between the metals, or in 
other words the polar groups of the animal and vegetable oils are attracted 
by the polar metal, and the fat or oil is less readily squeezed out from 
between the metal surfaces than oils or fats containing no polar groups. 
Thus they make better lubricants. 

Theory o£ shortening power applied to cookery. If the results 
of Langmuir and Harkins can be applied to lubricants they should be 
equally applicable to the use of fats and oils in cookery. The glycerol part 
of the fat is attracted by water. If it adheres closely to the water, one 
can conceive that the water might cement the flour particles less firmly 
together. Fats and oils with double bonds in their fatty acid chains, or 
those containing unsaturated glycerides, can be spread over a greater sur- 
face area than the saturated fats and would thus adhere to a larger water 
surface, or compete with the gluten for the water. Also, since the double 
bond of the fat adheres closely to the metal surface, it may be that it will 



SURFACE AREA COVERED 565 

adhere to the amino groups of the flour proteins, as well as to the water. 
This would make it more difficult to squeeze out from between the flour 
particles. Fats and oils containing unsaturated glycerides would have more 
shortening power because they cover a greater surface area per molecule 
and because they adhere more firmly to the water surface. If this is true, 
the fats and oils having the highest percentage of unsaturated acids and 
covering the greatest surface area should give the tenderest baked products. 
However, the area covered by a given amount of fat or oil in a dough or 
batter may vary. A sphere gives the least surface area for a definite weight 
or volume of a substance. If the oil or fat is emulsified and distributed in 
the batter in small spheres the total area covered may be less than if the 
same weight were distributed in very thin films or sheets. Even in oil-in- 
water emulsions the surface area covered for a definite weight of oil will 
vary with the degree of dispersion of the oil, for the greater the dispersion 
the greater the surface area covered. 

The surface area covered determines the shortening power of 
a fat or oil in baked products. The degree of shortening produced 
by a fat or oil in a given product depends primarily upon the surface area 
of the flour particles covered by the fat or oil. To a lesser degree shorten- 
ing power may also depend upon the extent of separation of the egg and 
milk proteins and the sugar from the flour particles by the fat. The fats 
and oils are insoluble in the other ingredients of baked products. Thus they 
may to a greater or less degree mechanically separate the ingredients of 
the batter but they never entirely lose their identity or change their char- 
acteristics. If flour and water are mixed together and baked, the resulting 
product is very hard, firm, and tough. When the water is added to the 
flour the protein particles become hydrated and form a continuous phase, 
somewhat similar to a gel, throughout the mass. When coagulated by heat 
they form a cement-like structure throughout the dough. If fat or oil is 
mixed with the flour particles, and water is then added, the fat coats a 
portion of the flour particles and forms layers, sheets, or films between 
them, giving the baked product tenderness. The factors that afifect the area 
of the flour covered are (1) manipulation, (2) temperature, (3) the 
ingredients used and their concentration, (4) the consistency of the fat or 
oil when added and its degree of unsaturation, and (5) the concentration 
of the fat. 

Manipulation. The manipulative factors include creaming, the thorough- 
ness with which the fat is mixed with the flour, and the manner of rolling, 
kneading, etc. In products containing sugar, if the fat and sugar are creamed 
so that air is incorporated, the product may be shorter or more tender. 
This will depend somewhat on the proportion of fat and sugar, and whether 
the maximum amount of air is incorporated. With certain proportions of 
fat to sugar more air can be incorporated. The increased shortness of the 
product may be attributed to the increased porosity. But creamed fat is 
also more plastic and thus more easily blended with flour. In addition the 



566 FATS AND OILS 

sugar crystals absorb fat which may aid in distributing fat in a batter but 
will probably reduce the area of the flour covered by the fat and thus tend 
to reduce the shortening power of the fat. This may at least partially 
explain why wafers, made by adding sugar to a standard pastry dough, 
are shorter with creamed fats, and least short with oils, the order of 
shortening power being nearly reversed from the order in pastry. 

In pastry the fat is mixed with the flour before the water is added. 
If this mixing is extensive so that the flour particles are well coated with 
the fat or oil, the product is shorter than when made from the same fat 
only slightly mixed with the flour. In the last instance the distribution of 
the fat increases and in the first decreases the heterogeneity of the final 
product. An oil or melted fat coats the flour particles more thoroughly 
with short mixing than a plastic fat. Noble et al. found flour added to the 
board when the dough was rolled lessened the shortening value of a modified 
shortbread. 

Temperature. Temperature affects the plasticity of a fat and the mobility 
of a melted fat or of an oil. At lower temperatures the plasticity of fats 
such as butter is not great. They spread less readily and the area of flour 
and other particles covered is less with the same extent of mixing than at 
higher temperatures. But at higher temperatures the surface area covered 
by a melted fat may decrease because of the increased tendency to form an 
oil-in-water emulsion, particularly in thin batters. In addition, at tempera- 
tures at which the fat is melted or very soft the gluten absorbs w^ater 
rapidly and becomes developed rapidly. This development of the gluten 
may offset increased shortening power owing to the soft fat coating a 
greater flour surface. 

The ingredients and their concentration. When the proportion of water 
in the product is rather high, as in griddle cakes, waffles, and muflfins, or 
in the so-called "pour" batters, the consistency of the batter permits the 
fat to form spheres easily because the batter is not stiff enough to deform 
the spheres entirely. Melted fat or oil is generally used in the *'pour" 
batters. In addition the lecithio-protein of the egg yolk used in these prod- 
ucts has strong emulsifying properties and increases the tendency to disperse 
the melted fat or oil as an oil-in-water emulsion. Observations have shown 
that the major portion of the fat, unless the fat solidifies and with the 
exception of fat adsorbed by the sugar crystals, is distributed as an oil-in- 
water emulsion in thin batters. 

In biscuits and pastry, in which the proportion of water is relatively 
smaller, and because the method of adding the fat to the flour is different 
from that in the "pour" batters, the major portion of the fat is adsorbed 
by or coats the flour particles. In cake a plastic fat like butter, when 
creamed with the sugar, always produces a more tender product than when 
the butter is melted. And, in general, all plastic fats produce more tender 
cakes than oils or melted fats. 

Consistency of fat and degree of saturation. Both these factors have been 



SUMMARY OF EXPERIMENTAL WORK 567 

considered. Obviously unsaturated glycerides have an opportunity to cover 
a greater surface area of the flour particles in biscuits and pastry because 
there are no emulsifying agents such as egg to tend to prevent their 
spreading. 

Concentration of fat. Other things being standardized, the surface area 
covered is greater as the concentration of the fat or oil is increased. 

Shortening power of a fat or oil varies in different products. Because of 
differences in methods of combining, in the concentration and kinds of 
ingredients, in concentration of the fat, in temperature of the fat, and in 
manipulative factors the shortening power of the same fat may vary in 
relation to that of other fats in different products. For example, butter 
generally produces tougher pastry than any of the plastic fats or the oils 
commonly used in food preparation, but butter generally produces more 
tender cakes than oils. The more tests one makes to determine the shorten- 
ing power of fats and oils, the more one hesitates to make dogmatic state- 
ments about the comparative shortening powers of various fats. However, 
in considering the comparative shortening power of fats and oils, the results 
published in the literature are usually based on the performance of the fat 
in pastry only. 

Summary of Experimental Work by Different Investigators on 
Shortening Power of Fats and Oils 

A machine to test the shortening power of cooked foods needs to be 
very sensitive. Davis has devised such a machine, called a shortometer. 
From tests upon cookies he reports lard to be the best shortening agent. 
He gives no explanation of the results obtained. 

Piatt and Fleming have stained fats and oils with Sudan HI, a red dye 
soluble in fats but not soluble in water, and examined the baked products 
and the batter, in this case cookies, under the microscope. They find the 
fat to be in thin layers between the starch granules when the material is 
mounted dry. In some instances the fat completely surrounds the starch 
granules; in others the granules touch with no fat layer between them. 
These layers of fat, which physically separate different parts of the dough 
and prevent them from coming together in a solid mass, vary in thickness 
in different sections of the dough. To have the best shortening effect a 
fat must adhere to the flour particles and not be squeezed out by pressure. 
They give the following order for the shortening power of different fats, 
lard having the greatest shortening power.

Butter

568 FATS AND OILS 

For these differences In shortening power, Piatt and Fleming have sug- 
gested that the following factors have minor or major effect: viscosity, 
surface tension of oil, the melting point of the fat, and orientation of the 
molecule due to double bonds of the fatty acid chains of the glycerides. 
The following is a short summary of their article. 

Viscosity gives a fat the power of spreading easily in the dough ; a more 
viscous fat will run out of the dough less readily in baking, but it is of 
relatively little importance in shortening power, as shown by the fact that 
some of the petroleum products were as viscid as lard but gave less shorten- 
ing power. 

A melting point close to that of lard seems desirable, yet this factor 
alone is not a satisfactory explanation in all cases, as coconut oils may be 
prepared having the same melting point as butter but less shortening power. 

Plasticity gives a fat the ability to spread easily, which is beneficial ; but 
the fact that the oils having no plasticity give greater shortening power 
than butter shows that plasticity is only one of the important factors. 

Owing to orientation of molecules, fats containing unsaturated glycerides 
cover a greater surface area than those with saturated glycerides. The 
shortening power of fats tested, with the exception of lard and lard com- 
pound, was in the same order as the percentage of unsaturated glycerides 
contained by the fats. 

The author has found that an oil is partially or wholly emulsified as 
an oil-in-water emulsion in uncooked cake batter. However, the cake batter 
contained milk and egg, whereas the cooky batter of Piatt and Fleming 
did not contain milk. In cake batters an unmelted fat is distributed in 
sheets, layers, or films of different thicknesses between the starch granules, 
and around the air bubbles and sugar crystals. Whether the oil remains 
emulsified during baking of a cake batter might have some effect on the 
finished product, but the distribution of the oil or fat when the batter 
or dough is being mixed undoubtedly affects the tenderness, for this is the 
period w^hen the gluten is being developed. 

Sudan III was first used in oils and fats. In trying to take photomicro- 
graphs it was found that the Sudan III dye was not always deep enough 
in value to give a clear picture. Dr. Benbrook and Miss Sloss of the 
Veterinary Department suggested using Scarlet R or Scharlach R, which 
stained the fat or oil a deeper color than Sudan III. It was a surprise to 
find that Scarlet R aided In locating some distributions not found w^ith 
Sudan III. Often the dyed fat can be seen through the microscope when the 
color Is not Intense enough to show clearly in a photomicrograph. 

Fisher found lard to have the greatest shortening power of the plastic 
fats tested in pastry. Using 41 and 44 per cent of fat (based on weight of 
the flour) she found the shortening value of 5 lards, 2 hydrogenated 
cottonseed oils, 1 hydrogenated lard, an animal stearin, and 1 all-vegetable 
oil compound as determined by breaking strength with the Bailey Shortom- 



SHORTENING EXPERIMENTS WITH PASTRY 569 

eter approximately paralleled their congealing points, those fats having the 
lowest congealing point having the greatest shortening power. 

Noble, McLaughlin, and Halliday investigated several factors influenc- 
ing the apparent shortening value of a fat, using a modified shortbread 
(sugar added to a pastry formula). They found that creaming the fat and 
sugar to a maximum volume produced wafers with smaller breaking 
strength, as determined by a Bailey Shortometer, than when the same fat 
was creamed to a minimum volume. Also after adding the flour and liquid 
to the creamed mass, thorough mixing so that no spots of creamed fat and 
sugar showed produced markedly more tender wafers than when the 
dough was incompletely mixed. If no flour was sprinkled on the board for 
rolling, wafers markedly more tender resulted than when the minimum 
amount of flour to prevent sticking was used. Beating the extra flour into 
the dough gave a more tender product than using it in rolling but a less 
tender one than omitting it entirely. 

Shortening experiments with pastry. Denton and Lowe have 
determined the shortening power of different fats in pastry. 'Tastry was 
chosen for the baked product in their experiments, as it is commonly used, 
contains a large proportion of fat and is made with a small number of 
ingredients. In addition to fat it contains water, flour, and salt." The 
pastry was mixed in a KitchenAid and the materials were incubated before 
mixing, so that the temperature of the ingredients when mixed was 80 °F. 

Denton and Lowe used the shortometer as designed by Davis for the 
shortening tests. Weight is applied at the upper end of a vertical rod. At 
the lower end of the rod a bar is attached which rests across the material 
to be broken. The crushing strength was determined by substituting for 
the bar a rod which punctured a hole in the pastry. Sometimes the weight 
rested an appreciable length of time on the pastry before breaking or 
crushing occurred. Thus they found in the breaking and crushing tests 
that the rate at which the load is applied and the time through which the 
load acts are both factors in determining the breaking and the crushing 
strength of pastry, which is quite fragile. In order to obtain a more uniform 
rate of loading than with shot they used mercury, run from a burette into 
a receptacle resting on a cap at the top of the shortometer. Thus the weight 
or load for crushing the pastry gradually increased. 

Denton and Lowe found that in general the fats and the oils having 
the highest percentage of unsaturated glycerides gave the shortest pastries. 
They found an exception in butter, which gave less shortening power 
than coconut oil, although moisture-free butter, with only the butter fat 
used, drained free of curd, produced a very tender pastry. Here the heat- 
ing of the butter fat to render it moisture free may have affected its 
shortening power. 

From data. Table 65, it can be seen that the order for different fats 
in the table varies in some cases according to whether the crushing or the 
breaking average is taken. Therefore, the results should be taken in groups

rather than individual experiments. The oils, corn, cottonseed, and chicken 
gave the most tender pastries. The pastries next in order were obtained 
with second-grade lard, bulk lard, or when a temporary emulsion was 
made by shaking the oil and the water and then adding this emulsion 
quickly to the flour. The latter is a method often suggested in recipes, as 
it tends to produce a flakier and less crumbly pastry than when the oil is 
first mixed with the flour and the water added last. 

Puff pastry shortening. The puff pastry shortening is a product con- 
taining about 30 to 45 per cent of oleostearin and from 45 to 60 per cent 
of cottonseed or other vegetable oil. It is prepared by mixing the ingre- 



EFFECT OF EXTENT OF MIXING 571 

dients and heating to a common melting point, mixing, chilling in water, 
and working. The finished product has 7 to 10 per cent of moisture. It is 
very waxy, and is easily rolled in thin layers for use in puff pastry, for 
which it produces excellent results, but it is poor for ordinary pastry. 

Butter and margarine. Butter and margarine gave a very hard pastry. 
The emulsified fats, such as butter, margarine, and puff pastry shortening, 
gave harder pastries than their moisture-free products. To render the 
butter and margarine moisture free, they were heated at 75 °C. 

Class results. Class results are in agreement with results by the 
shortometer. There is enough difference in the shortening power of dif- 
ferent fats, so that pastries in which butter, lard, hydrogenated fats and 
oils, and oil have been used can be placed in order of tenderness by break- 
ing with the fingers, if the pastry has been made under standardized con- 
ditions. Butter gives the hardest and toughest, and oil may give the most 
tender. The lards usually give more tender pastry than the hydrogenated 
fats or hydrogenated oils. Observing housekeepers often state that they 
obtain shorter pastry from second-grade lard, although the odor and flavor 
may not be so good as the first-grade lard. Second-grade lards contain a 
higher percentage of the unsaturated glycerides. Two types of pastry are 
obtained with oil. If the pastry is crumbly, the oil yields the most tender 
pastry of the series. However, if it is flaky, the pastry may be about as tough 
and hard as that with butter or like the lard. These two types are probably 
due to the temperature of the ingredients when mixed, the thoroughness 
with which the oil is mixed with the flour before the water is added, the 
extent of mixing the water with the flour, and the proportion of water. 
Longer mixing after the water is added seems to increase the flakiness of 
the pastry made with oil. For several quarters the class has had only flaky 
pastry with oil, the pastry being mixed 40 to 50 strokes with a three- 
tined fork. 

Increasing the fat results in a more tender pastry. Increasing the water 
in a given recipe decreases the tenderness of pastry. If both fat and water 
are increased, the result depends upon the proportion of each used; but 
unless the increase in fat is very small, the resulting pastry is more tender, 
the fat having a greater effect than the water. The gluten of pastry flour 
cannot be developed to the extent that gluten of bread flour can; thus 
pastry flour gives a more tender pastry than bread flour if the conditions 
under which the pastries are made are standardized. 

Effect of extent of mixing on shortness of pastry. The extent of 
mixing after the water is added affects the shortness of pastry. It is rather 
interesting that, although longer mixing, a great deal of handling, and 
rerolling tend to increase the toughness of pastry, mixing the water and 
flour with a fork or a utensil which cuts through the dough instead of 
packing it, as in Experiment 95B, for 40 to 50 strokes, usually gives a 
more tender pastry than mixing 20 to 30 strokes. But handling the pastry 
after it is mixed, i.e., kneading and rerolling, increases its toughness, 



572 FATS AND OILS 

though very careful reroUing may increase the flakiness without materially 
increasing its toughness. 

Flakiness. Flakiness is considered a desirable quality in pastry. Melted 
fats and the oils usually give a more crumbly and a less flaky crust, 
although a flaky crust is often obtained with oil or melted fat. Bread flour 
tends to give a more flaky crust than soft-wheat flour. The temperature of 
the ingredients may affect the flakiness. With the harder fats there is a 
greater tendency for the fat to stay in layers, as flakiness depends upon the 
layers of fat and flour being separated by steam and probably to a lesser 
extent by air in the baking. The proportion of water to fat has some effect. 
When the proportion of water to fat exceeds or falls below a certain ratio, 
the pastry is less flaky. The extent of mixing the fat with the flour, as 
well as the method of combining the water, by mixing or by cutting the 
water into the fat and flour, may also influence the flakiness of the pastry. 
The method of handling the dough may have some effect. Rerolling and 
careful handling may increase flakiness and also toughness. The flakiness 
of pastry is also increased by rolling with thin layers of fat between layers 
of the dough. 

Soaking of crust in baking pies. Excessive soaking of the crust 
during and after baking occurs most frequently with fruit pies, as cherry, 
blackberry, blueberry, and loganberry, and custard pies. Many suggestions 
to prevent soaking have been offered and these have been collected in 
Experiment 98. Tests, using pastry made in one batch and rolling all to 
the same thickness, have shown that partially baking the under crust before 
adding the filling only increases the soaking. Brushing the under crust with 
butter or fat aids to a certain extent, but for cooked or canned fruit 
thickening the juice before adding the filling to the pastry is the most 
effective means of preventing soaking. If fresh cherries or berries are used, 
then mixing flour or cornstarch with the sugar is as good as cooking the 
fruit first before adding it to the pie. The only advantage of cooking and 
thickening fresh fruit before adding the hot filling to the pastry is that it 
shortens the cooking time in the oven. 

The best Avay to prevent soaking of the crust in custard pie has been 
mentioned in the chapter on eggs, that is, cooking the filling and pastry 
separately. If this is not desirable, scalding the milk before adding it to 
the eggs and using 3 eggs to a pint of milk help the custard to set more 
rapidly.

FATS AND OILS 



Experiment 89. 

To determine the smoking temperatures of different fats. 

Use, preferably, evaporating dishes or small sauce pans of the same size. 
Have the fat come to within 1 inch of the top of the dish. Heat the fat slowly. 
When you see the first puff of smoke, record the temperature of the fat. 
Cool and take the smoking temperature a second time. Compare the smoking 
temperature of olive oil, cottonseed oil, peanut oil, corn oil, fresh hydrogenated 
fat, lard, used lard, and used hydrogenated fat.

Experiment 92. 

To determine the temperature at which foods actually cook. 

Use potatoes sliced and cut into strips, and croquettes. When the fat has 
reached the temperature which has been decided as best for cooking raw foods 
under Experiment 91, immerse the food in the fat. Watch the temperature of 
the fat as the food cooks. Note also the time required to brown the food. Do 
you think as a result of this experiment that heating a fat to its smoking 
temperature always gives a desirable temperature for cooking foods?

Doughnuts 
Experiment 94. 

To determine the factors which influence the tenderness, the texture, and 
the amount of fat absorbed in doughnuts. 
Recipe: 

Flour Syi cups 588 grams or use the amount found best under A 

Baking powder 2 tablespoons 21 grams 

Salt 1 teaspoon 4 grams 

Sugar 1 cup 200 grams 

Fat 2 tablespoons 25 grams 

Eggs 2 96 grams 

Milk 1 cup 244 grams 

Nutmeg H teaspoon 

Cinnamon H teaspoon 

It is more convenient to work in groups of five or six girls for the doughnut 
experiments. It will take two girls to fry the doughnuts; one to watch the 
temperature, one to time, to put the doughnuts in, turn, and take them out of 
the fat. Or a third girl may time the cooking. One girl should do all the 
mixing, doing it in the same way each time and with the number of strokes 
designated under each experiment. Another girl should do all the rolling and 
cutting, handling each batch in the same way and trying not to stretch or pull 
the cut dough out of shape. Other girls may weigh the materials. The eggs 
should be beaten together for all the experiments to be done by the group in 
one period. It is best not to use the results of the first mixing for comparisons 
but to use them for obtaining technic in handling the dough in mixing, cutting, 
and cooking. 

Directions for mixing. 

Remove the flour for rolling before the baking powder is added to it. Sift 
the flour and baking powder together 2 times. Combine the thoroughly beaten 
eggs, sugar, salt, and softened or melted fat, mixing until very light and fluffy. 
Use the same kind and size of bowl for mixing the materials for each experi- 
ment. Add the milk and flour to the other ingredients and mix the designated 
amount. 

Roll the dough between boards yi or y% inch in thickness, tacked to a bread 
board, so that all the doughnuts will be the same thickness. Each group should 
use cutters that have the same diameter. If the dough is divided into 2 parts 
and each half rolled in part of the flour and shaped into a long roll before 
placing between the boards it facilitates ease of handling. There should be 3 
doughnuts from each part of the dough and 6 for each experiment. 

In cooking, the doughnuts should be turned when half of the time allowed 
for cooking is gone. When the time is up, lift each doughnut quickly from 
the fat onto a skewer held over the kettle so that the fat will drain back into 
the kettle. The doughnuts should be turned and taken out in the same order 
they are put into the fat. 



DOUGHNUTS 



577 



Weigh the kettle of fat before and after cooking the doughnuts for each 
experiment. The loss of weight of kettle of fat is the amount of fat absorbed 
by the doughnuts. Weigh the doughnuts before and after cooking if the per- 
centage of fat absorbed is to be calculated. The percentage of fat in the cooked 
doughnuts may be determined by analysis, but this requires too long a time 
for class results. The percentage of fat absorbed may be based on the weight 
of the cooked doughnuts or on the weight of the uncooked doughnuts. Denton 
has suggested that the former is preferable, and this method has been used 
in calculating the results given in the tables. 

A. To determine the best proportion of flour to use. 

The proportion of flour to produce a tender doughnut of good texture varies 
with different brands and kinds of flour. Therefore, it will be necessary to 
determine the best proportion for the kind and brand that you use; this pro- 
portion is to be used in the following experiments. With some flours it will be 
necessary to start with 5j4 cups or 6 cups of flour instead of 5^^ cups. The 
dough should be soft and light but not too sticky. If desired, two series of 
experiments may be run, using bread flour in one and soft-wheat flour in 
the other. 

Prepare ^ of the recipe, reserving 1 tablespoon of flour for the board. Mix 
the dough 80 strokes with a wooden spoon. Follow directions for rolling and 
cutting. Cook the 6 doughnuts for 3 minutes at 175° to 180°C. (345° to 
355°F.). 

1. Use 5y2 cups of flour (616 grams) for the full recipe. 

2. Use 5}i cups of flour (588 grams) for the full recipe. 

3. Use 5 cups of flour (560 grams) for the full recipe. 

4. Use 4}i cups of flour (532 grams) for the full recipe. 

B. To determine the effect of extent of mixing upon tenderness, texture, and 
fat absorption of doughnuts. 

1. Prepare the full recipe, reserving 4 tablespoons of flour for rolling. Use 
the proportion of flour found best under A. Mix a total of 40 strokes with 
a wooden spoon. Observe and record any changes in the dough during mixing. 
Remove approximately 54 of the dough (about 280 grams). Follow directions 
for rolling. Cook the 6 doughnuts for 3 minutes at 175° to 180°C. Use the 
remaining dough in the following experiments. 

2. Mix the remaining dough from Bl a total of 60 strokes and remove 
approximately 280 grams. Proceed as in Bl. 

3. Mix the remaining dough from B2 a total of 80 strokes. Remove approxi- 
mately 280 grams. Proceed as in Bl. 

4. Mix the remaining dough from B3 a total of 100 strokes. Proceed as in 
Bl.

What is the effect of increased mixing of the dough upon fat absorption 
in doughnuts? Does the dough become more or less sticky with longer mix- 
ing? Which amount of mixing gives the best flavor and the best texture? The 
least fat absorption? What is the effect of length of time of cooking upon fat 
absorption of doughnuts? The effect of temperature of cooking? Compare the 
dough that has stood with the dough that did not stand, in respect to the ease 
of rolling and the consistency. Does chilling increase the ease of rolling? What 
is the effect upon the texture and the fat absorption of standing before cooking? 

What is the effect of increasing the sugar in the recipe upon fat absorp- 
tion? Upon texture? Does increase of sugar in the recipe require longer mixing 
of the dough? Is there any relation between the texture of the doughnuts with 
increased sugar and the texture of cakes when the proportion of sugar is 
increased? What is the effect of increasing the proportion of egg upon the tex- 
ture of the doughnuts? Upon fat absorption? Of increasing the fat? Adding

Pastry 
Experiment 95.

Recipe : 

Flour, all-purpose 1 cup 112 grams 

Fat yi cup 66 grams 

Salt y2 teaspoon 2 grams- 
Water 



580 FATS AND OILS 

Directions for ?nixing: 

The flour may be either a hard- or soft-wheat all-purpose one. If a soft- 
wheat flour is used, it is probably preferable to reduce the proportion of fat 
to 34 cup (50 grams). • 

Place the weighed flour and the salt in a bowl, add the fat, and cut into 
the flour with a fat cutter. The fat may be worked into the flour by rubbing 
between the tips of the fingers. The fat should be mixed with the flour until 
the mixture resembles coarse corn meal. The number of strokes required to 
cut the fat into the flour will vary, the hard, cold fats requiring far more 
strokes than the softened fats or the oil. A record may be kept of the number 
of strokes required for comparison of ease of mixing. In mixing the fat with 
the finger tips, work quickly so as not to melt the fat. Compare your fat and 
flour mixture with your neighbors' to see if they are about the same consistency. 
Add the water in such a manner that it is distributed rather evenly over the 
flour mixture. Cut the water into the fat and flour, or stir with a two-tined 
fork. 

The pastry rolls better if allowed to stand about 5 minutes after mixing. 
Then work into a ball, using 8 motions of the hand to get the material to- 
gether. In rolling the pastry some can be rolled without adding flour to the 
board, but do not use more than 1 teaspoon of flour for each pastry. The 
pastry may be rolled between boards y% to 3/16 inch in thickness, which are 
tacked to the bread board. Strips of wax paper just wide enough to fit between 
the cleats may be used for rolling and handling the pastry. One piece of paper 
is placed between the cleats. The dough to be rolled is placed on this paper and 
a second sheet of paper is placed over the dough. After rolling the top paper 
is removed. The dough is lifted on the lower sheet of paper and is placed on 
the baking sheet or tin by inverting the paper, pressing lightly, and then 
removing the paper. If the dough is rolled in long strips, it should be shaped 
into a long strip before rolling. For the pastries in which the proportion of 
ingredients is changed until they will not roll easily, the pastry can be partially 
rolled, then placed in the pan and patted quickly to the same thickness as the 
rolled pastry. If the pastries are not the same thickness they bake differently 
and require different lengths of time for baking. 

Bake in pans of the same size, shape, and material. Bake at 220° to 225°C. 
(425° to 435°F.), until a light golden brown. 

A. To determine the proportion of water to give a desirable pastry with the 
brand of flour used. 

1. Use 24 grams or cc. of water for the full recipe. Mix 40 strokes with a 
two- or three-tined fork.

D. To determine the effect of type of flour. 

If a hard-wheat flour has been used, substitute a soft-wheat flour or vice 
versa. Repeat B using any fat desired. 

What is the effect of increased mixing upon the tenderness of pastry? Upon 
Its flakiness? Which amount of mixing results in the best pastry? What is the 
effect of substituting soft-wheat for hard-wheat flour? Can the fat be reduced 
when pastry flour is used? Can the pastry-flour pastries be mixed longer than 
bread-flour ones? Which pastries roll easiest? Which are difficult to handle? 
Which fat gives the shortest pastry? Which the toughest? Which fat pro- 
duces the most flaky pastry? Which the least flaky? 

E. To determine the effect of varying the proportion of ingredients. 

1. Increase the fat to 100 grams or J^ cup and the water to 6 grams more 
for the full recipe than that found best under A. Use bread flour and butter. 
Mix the water with the fat and flour with the number of strokes found best 
under B. 

2. Repeat El, but use hydrogenated cottonseed oil. 

3. Repeat El, but use lard. 

4. Repeat El, but use oil. 

5. Repeat El, but use hydrogenated lard. 

F. Decrease the fat in the full recipe to 50 grams or 54 cup. Use all-purpose 
flour and any fat desired. Use the proportion of water found best under A. 
Mix with the number of strokes found best under B. 



Experiment 96. 

To determine the effect of the temperature of the ingredients when mixed 
upon the texture and tenderness of pastry. 



582 FATS AND OILS 

1. Use all-purpose flour and lard. Use the proportion of water found best 
under 95A, and mix with the number of strokes found best under 95B. Use ice 
water and chilled fat. 

2. Prepare twice the quantity used in the other experiments. Repeat 1, but 
have the water boiling. Add the fat and stir until the fat is melted. Then add 
the flour and salt and mix with the number of strokes found best under 95B. 
Divide in two portions. Roll and bake one part. Use the other portion for 3. 

3. Chill the dough remaining from 2 before rolling. 

4. Repeat 1, but melt the fat before cutting into the flour. 

Which gives the flakiest pastry? Is the pastry made with hot water difficult 
to roll unless chilled? What is the effect of melting the fat upon the texture 
of the pastry? 

Experiment 97. 

To determine the effect of mixing by different methods and continued roll- 
ing upon pastry. 

1. Repeat Experiment 96,1, but prepare twice the quantity used in the other 
experiments. Roll and bake half the dough. Use the other portion for 2. 

2. Reroll the dough remaining from 97,1, four or five times and bake. Com- 
pare with 97,1, for flakiness and tenderness. 

3. Use all-purpose flour and lard. Use the proportion of water found best 
under 95A. Put all the ingredients in the mixing bowl together. Then cut with 
knives until the dough is the consistency to roll. Compare with other methods 
of mixing. 

4. Use all-purpose flour and lard. Mix the fat very thoroughly with the 
flour. Use the proportion of water found best under 95A. Add the water and 
mix with the number of strokes found best under 95B. 

5. Repeat 97,4, but cut the fat into the flour with only a few^ strokes, leaving 
the fat and flour coarsely flaked. 

6. Decrease the fat in the full recipe to 40 grams. Use all-purpose flour and 
the proportion of water found best under 95A. Mix with the number of 
strokes found best under 95B. After rolling the dough add 5 grams of fat in 
small flakes over half the rolled dough. Fold the dough and reroll. Add 5 
more grams of fat and reroll. Bake. 

What is the effect of rolling the dough several times upon the tenderness 
of the pastry? Its flakiness? Can a good pastry be obtained by combining all 
the ingredients at one time? Does adding a portion of the fat while rolling 
increase the flakiness of the pastry? Its tenderness?

1. Use other fats in addition to the ones given in the outline. 

2. Reduce the proportion of the fats and the oil, and find the amount equiva- 
lent to 50 grams of butter, as far as can be determined from breaking the 
pastries with the fingers. 

3. Make a temporary emulsion of the oil and water. Then add quickly to 
the flour and mix. 

4. Spiced pastry. Add ^^ teaspoon of a spice mixture to the pastry recipe, 
Experiment 95. It may be any mixture of spices desired or the following: 
Yz teaspoon cinnamon, 1/6 teaspoon nutmeg, 54 teaspoon allspice, and ]/\ tea- 
spoon cloves. 



SUGGESTED ADDITIONAL EXPERIMENTS

Experiment 98. 

To determine the best method of preventing juicy fruit soaking the crust in 
pies. 

Make enough pastry at one time for all the tests. It can be made on a 
KitchenAid or mixed by hand. It is preferable, if possible, to roll all the 
pastry the same thickness. A large rolling pin may be made or a rod used to 
roll the pastry the same thickness. The cleats between which the dough is 
rolled should be placed wide enough apart on the bread board so that when 
rolled the dough is large enough for the pans used. See directions under 
Experiment 95. Bake at 220° to 225°C. (425° to 435°F.). The temperature 
may be lowered if necessary for the last part of the baking. One-half table- 
spoon of butter for each cup of fruit improves the flavor. 

Use an upper and a lower crust in baking the pies. Use a fruit that is 
juicy. Sweeten the fruit in one large container. Then divide into equal portions 
for each pie. 

1. Use the sweetened juicy fruit for a control. 

2. Brush the top of the under crust with melted butter. Then add the 
sweetened fruit. 

3. Brush the top of the under crust with egg white. Add the sweetened 
fruit. 

4. Partially bake the under crust. Then add the fruit and upper crust. Bake. 

5. Drain the juice ofiE the fruit and thicken with cornstarch. Use 1 table- 
spoon of cornstarch for every cup of juice from very sour fruit with thin 
juice; but use a smaller proportion of cornstarch for fruit juice that is not 
very tart. Boil the juice and cornstarch. Remove from the fire and add the 
fruit. Add to the rolled dough while the fruit is still warm. Bake. Is the 
baking time of the pie shortened when the fruit Is added to the dough while 
warm? 

6. Sprinkle the top of the lower crust with flour. Add fruit. 

7. Mix the cornstarch or flour with the sugar. Add to the fruit. Use the 
same proportion of cornstarch as given under 5. 

8. Repeat 1, but bake the pie at a much lower temperature than that used 
for the other pies. 

If desired, the series may be repeated using fresh fruit. 

Keep portions of each pie until the next day to compare the amount of 
soaking on standing. The addition of a small amount of butter and salt to 
the fruit in each pie will improve the flavor.
