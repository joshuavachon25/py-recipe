Preface 



DESSERTS' follows 'Salads' in natural 
sequence, its complement as well as its suc- 
cessor — the success of one persuading the 
publication of the other. If not the most impoi'tant, 
surely desserts are the most interesting course on the 
bill-of-fare, the last and parting word with which the 
skillful hostess bids her guests let the memory of her 
repast linger in their minds as on their palates. 

The range is wide. The best cakes., pies., ice-creams., 
and fruit desserts are here included., in addition to those 
delicate and aesthetic importations from dainty France., 
not yet as widely known as they deserve to be by their 
name of French Pastries. JVithin these broadened 
limits, the modern woman will find ample chance for 
the expression of her own taste and personality, and be 
able to crown her luticheons and diimers with delicious 
marvels of pastry-making, garnered from every land 
where cooking has attained the dignity of a fine art. 



The two hundred and more recipes this book contains 
are set forth in terms too plain to admit of mistakes: by 
their means the novice may quickly grow into profi- 
ciency^ while the accomplished housekeeper will thereby 
find her scope of entertainment interestingly enlarged. 

From the combinations given new ones are easily 
attained y permitting not merely individual expression^ 
but the greater joys of the creative artist. 

Surely if he is a benefactor of mankind who makes 
two blades of grass grow where one grew before^ 
credit must fall upon the lady of that house which 
offers its inmates and guests the best the world affords — ■ 
a score of epicurean delights where there were but 
half a score before. 



Dessert Lore 



THE fascinating art of pastry-making was 
known to ancient nations. Its origin dates 
from the infancy of the world — from the 
day when the primal man, having before him flour, 
butter, and eggs, evolved the idea of mixing them 
to gratify the palate. After they were combined, 
lo, he had cakes and brioches! They were good to 
the taste but not altogether satisfying, so in the 
course of evolution he added honey and fruits — 
later sugar. He shaped these preparations in 
divers ways, and in succeeding ages the traditional 
cake graced the festive board in hut and in castle. 

The Egyptians served many kinds of cakes on 
their tables. The Jews knew of at least three 
kinds — one kneaded with oil, another fried in oil, 
and a third merely rubbed over with oil. The 
extravagant indulgence of their appetites by 
the Greeks and the Romans led them to perfect 
many rich and ingenious combinations for the 
purpose of restoring a failing appetite or one 
greatly impaired by too vigorous and too frequent 
onslaughts. Some of these pastries appear appe- 
tizing at the present day; others we should con- 
sider unworthy of the modern epicure. 

[51 



In sunny France the making of pastries has long 
been a favorite art. Any French bill-of-fare or 
cookery book will betray to a thoughtful reader 
the attention given to the subject not only by the 
wittiest, gayest, and most beautiful women, but by 
the wisest men. The resounding names attached 
to French dishes are no mere tributes of culinary 
artists to the great in the land, but actually 
point out their originators. Thus D'Uxelle sauce 
was named after the French general who per- 
fected it. Bechamel cream sauce was invented 
by the Marquis de Bechamel during the reign of 
Louis XIV. Cotellettes a la Maintenon were 
created by the famous lady of that name. Mira- 
beau is the offspring of the distinguished French 
orator, and Madame de Pompadour produced 
many new dishes which bear her name. 

The Guild of the Parisian Pastry Cooks boasted 
of being one of the ancient associations of France. 
They took the title of "Masters of the Art of 
Pastry," and in 1566, Charles IX conceded to 
them the exclusive and valued privilege of pre- 
paring the Eucharistic Wafer. 

Literary men have always formed the entourage 
of a great chef, for none can judge better than men 
of letters all there is in the art of cooking. 
Accustomed as they are to refinements, "they can 
appreciate more than others the refinements of the 
table," says Dumas in his book on cooking, thus 
paying both himself and his confreres a delicate 
little compliment at the expense of the non-literary 

[6] 



world. Despite this naive self-glorification, he 
states a fact that helps to point a moral — that 
indifference to cooking indicates neither refine- 
ment, intellect, nor social eminence. 

Desserts and the like, as they are known to the 
modern table, had their beginning in Italy. Later 
they were introduced into France, became an art 
among the people and thereby reached perfection. 
The term "dessert" is generally applied to the final 
sweet at either dinner or luncheon. Careme used 
to say that the dessert had been elevated into 
science with the idea of retaining women and 
children at the table in friendly family converse. 

Cooking and cultivation are by no means antag- 
onistic; they naturally go together. We summon 
with loving approbation the vision of Marie 
Antoinette in her pretty dairy-maid costume 
gracefully wielding the churn-dasher and moulding 
the butter into irresistible little pats. How charm- 
ing is the picture of our own Dolly Madison 
carefully blending a salad dressing, or of Margaret 
Fuller deftly shelling peas, or of Charlotte Bronte 
surreptitiously taking the eyes out of the potatoes 
for fear of hurting the feelings of her old blind 
servant. Even Leo X, it was declared by some of 
his friends, made more sauces than saints. 

At present there is a deal of talk about cook- 
ing; the topic takes its place in a little less 
degree with politics, suffrage, settlement work, 
conservation, and the high cost of living. The 
fact of its being mildly fashionable gives hope 

[7] 



that in the future young women of refined pro- 
cHvities will accept it as an art worthy their 
notice. Truth to tell, it is vital; it is essential, 
not only to human happiness, but to human 
progress. 

It is neither necessary nor desirable that a lady 
spend much time in her kitchen. Only that one 
hour a day which Tallyrand, the busy, wily 
statesman, devoted to consultation with his cook, 
will assure satisfactory service in any dining 
room. After giving a little time and practice to 
the mastering of a few principles, one will be able 
to instruct the cook, who is often ambitious to 
excel, and will herself become highly proficient if 
guided aright. 

Regarded from any point of view the love of good 
foods and dainty service deserves nothing but 
commendation and encouragement. In speaking 
of food and its rational appreciation a modern 
philosopher says: "Not to care about what we 
eat is either genuine or hypocritic. If genuine, it 
betokens a defect of which we ought to be ashamed; 
for surely the stomach is as noble an organ as the 
face and deserves as much earnest attention. If 
hypocritical, it is a most absurd affectation." 

It has been remarked that a too exclusive diet 
of starchy foods weakens the fibre and even the 
courage. The East Indians are cited as instances. 
They live almost entirely upon rice, and have 
been subjugated by all who have tried to 
conquer them. On the other hand, starchy foods 

[8] 



seem to have a strengthening effect upon the 
frugiverous domestic animals, being more sub- 
stantial than their ordinary vegetable dietary. 

But sugar, which enters so largely into the making 
of desserts, is highly nutritious whether by itself 
or in its natural state as found in different plants. 
Animals are fond of it; and the English, who fre- 
quently give it to their favorite horses, have 
observed that by its use their animals are better 
able to endure extreme exertion and fatigue. For 
the same reason modern armies are allowed sugar 
in their rations. 

Among the healthful and mildly stimulating foods 
are grouped all the saccharine substances — fruit 
juices, sugar, molasses, and honey. On this point 
Dr. Pereira says that the injurious effects ascribed 
to sugar are more imaginary than real. 

The fondness of children for sweets may be re- 
garded as a natural instinct, since nature, by 
putting sugar in the mother's milk, evidently 
intended it to form a part of the child's nourish- 
ment. Instead, therefore, of repressing this appe- 
tite for sugar, it should be gratified in moderation. 
The popular notion of its having a tendency to 
injure the teeth has little foundation. During the 
sugar season in the West Indies all the negroes 
on the plantation, and even the dogs, grow fat 
from eating sugar. Yet no people on earth have 
finer teeth than the negroes of the West Indies. 
It is possible that the erroneous idea has been 

[9] 



propagated by frugal housewives in order to 
deter their children from indulging in an expen- 
sive luxury. 

There is no doubt that both children and adults 
are often injured by the use of sugar, but it is 
not because it is unhealthful in its nature, but 
because it is either used in excess or in an improper 
way. Highly concentrated foods in quantities are 
not easily digested because they cannot be acted 
upon properly by the muscular contractions of 
the stomach, or are not so minutely divided as to 
enable the gastric juices to do their full duty. 
Now sugar, and all products in which it is con- 
tained in large quantity, are highly concentrated 
nourishment and should not be eaten except with 
other foods. The reason that children's stomachs 
are upset by sugar is that they eat it too often, 
in too large quantities, or when unmixed with 
other edibles. 

In order to succeed in making good desserts one 
must possess deftness of hand and clearness of 
brain — qualities which gradually transform the 
artisan into the artist. One must have a lively 
and inventive fancy, a desire to originate, and a 
willingness to profit by mistakes. The artist's 
taste must be so keen that he knows intuitively 
what proportions of the various ingredients make 
the most palatable whole. 

It is worth while to accomplish leaf and puff 
paste, since so many dainty trifles can be made 
of them, which attempted with the ordinary short 
paste would be unsightly. 

[10] 



Use only the best materials in making pastries. 
The shortening should be fresh, sweet, and hard. 
It is a mistake to suppose that butter which is 
not good enough for the table can be used for 
shortening; it is bound to flavor all it enters. The 
water should be cold — ice-water is the best. 

The paste should be rolled on a fiat, cold sur- 
face — marble preferred ; and should be handled 
as little as possible. Paste is more flaky and will 
puff more if put in a covered dish and set in an 
ice-cold place for half an hour, or even for an hour, 
before using. It will be greatly improved by 
brushing it with the white of an egg as often as 
it is rolled out and the pieces of butter placed 
on it. This will help to make it rise in flakes. 
As this is the great beauty of leaf paste it is well 
to try this method. 

The reason so many fail in the preparation of 
leaf paste is that they handle it badly — not 
because they do not make it properly. Caution 
is also needed in heating the oven for baking. The 
temperature is important; it should be kept just 
right as long as the pastry is in it. It is well to 
test the temperature with a small piece of the 
pastry before attempting to bake the whole. If 
you allow the oven to cool while the pastry is in 
it, the under crust will become heavy and clammy, 
and the upper crust dishearteningly fall in. The 
pastry should bake to a light brown and it will 
then be fresh and flaky in appearance. 

[11] 



Care should be taken to prevent the pastry from 
burning in the oven. This it is likely to do some- 
times after the icing is laid on. 

To glaze pastry put the white of an egg on a 
plate and beat it to a stiff froth with the blade 
of a knife. When the pastry is nearly baked, 
spread this froth on it, and sift powdered sugar 
over it. Put the pastry back in the oven to 
set the glaze, and in a few minutes it will be 
done. To make a meringue add a tablespoonful 
of white sugar to the beaten white of an egg, 
spread over the top, and slightly brown in the 
oven. 

Pie crust can be kept a week if placed in a tightly 
covered dish and set in the ice-box in summer, 
or in an ordinarily cool place in winter. This 
will make possible a fresh pie every day with very 
little trouble, and the last pie will be better than 
the first. 

When baking pumpkin, squash, or custard pies, 
it is best to bake the paste first. This will pre- 
vent the mixture from being absorbed by the 
crust. If stewed fruit is used, the filling should 
be perfectly cool when put in, otherwise it will 
leave the bottom crust sodden. To prevent juices 
from soaking into the crust when making a pie, 
wet the under crust with the white of an egg just 
before putting in the mixture. If the top of the 
pie is brushed over with the white of an egg it 
will give it lustre. 

[12] 



If currants are used they should be washed, well- 
dried, and dredged with flour. Raisins and all 
dried fruits for pies and cakes should be seeded 
and dredged with flour before using. Almonds 
should be blanched by pouring boiling water over 
them. They should remain in the hot water 
two minutes and then put in cold water, when the 
skins can be slipped off easily. In pounding 
almonds add a little orange water with fine sugar 
to prevent them from becoming oily. 

During the warm months fruits are always pre- 
ferable desserts to the heavier starches and sugars. 
To be wholesome, appetizing, and easily digested, 
fruits should be thoroughly ripe, served plain and 
uncooked. 

The chief reason why more women do not give 
their pastries due personal attention lies in the 
fact that discouragement so often follows failure; 
and the less accountable the failure, the greater 
the discouragement. It may be said that prac- 
tice and its resulting accustomedness will cure 
many apparent ills; but the precepts of this book 
will go far toward making success possible from 
the first. Let it not be forgotten, either, that in 
desserts, as in nearly all human affairs worthy of 
attention, the chief difficulties lie at the crossing 
of the threshold. This passed, a wide and ever^ 
pleasing vista is opened to the eye.

[17] 



French Pastry 



FRENCH pastries are the newest desserts 
on the menu, and among the most aristo- 
cratic. Difficult and mysterious as they 
may appear to be to the unaccustomed, they are 
easily and quickly made. Of introduction recent 
enough to make them novel, of delicious flavor and 
aspect, nothing can be more welcome to those 
weary of the inevitable ice cream and cake. 

More than a hundred recipes for these delicious 
desserts are given, all of which have been satis- 
factorily tested. There is something for every 
taste. As good things slightly known, and deserv- 
ing better acquaintance, they are especially com- 
mended to the fastidious. 



[10] 



Leaf Paste 

All French pastry Is made upon a foundation of 
leaf paste. To make this, drain a pound of butter 
and chill it with ice. Rub with a quarter of this 
a pound of flour, pouring in water enough to form 
a stiff paste. Lay it away for a quarter of an 
hour. Dredge the table lightly with flour, lay 
the paste on it, and roll it square. Similarly roll 
out the butter remaining, lay it in and on the 
centre of the paste, the edges of which should be 
brought back over the butter and enclose it well. 
Roll the whole to the thickness of a quarter of an 
inch and fold it into three layers. It has now had 
one turn. Fold it again into three layers and 
roll it the second time, but in the contrary direc- 
tion. It has now had two turns. Leave it for 
fifteen minutes and give it two turns more, and 
after a second quarter of an hour give it the two 
final turns. More than six turns are unnecessary. 
Cover the paste with cloth and lay it away in a 
cold place until needed. 



As when some skillful cook, to please each guest 
Would in one mixture comprehend a feast, 
With due proportion and judicious care. 

—Pope. 

[20] 



Puff Paste 

Leaf paste and puff paste are often confused, 
though greatly different. As leaf paste is the 
foundation for all French pastry, so puff paste 
serves for eclairs, cream puffs, and the like, a paste 
being required which will not, like the other, flake 
and crumble when handled. To make puff paste, 
put half a pound of butter in a pint of water and 
bring them to a boil, adding half a pound of flour 
and stirring until the mixture is smooth. Remove 
It from the fire, add ten well beaten eggs, and 
stir vigorously. 

Almond Cakes 

In a large bowl place a pound of blanched almonds, 
a pound of sugar, with a little spice, and essence 
of lemon. Add the yolks of fifteen eggs, and mix 
them all together with a wooden spoon. Stir in 
the well-beaten whites, and add a little sifted 
pastry flour, which must be thoroughly worked 
in. Have buttered gem tins in readiness, and 
bake the cakes to a light brown in a moderate 
oven. 



Good living is due to that action of the judgment 
by which the things which please our taste are 
preferred to all others. 

[21] 



Allumette 

Roll out ice-cold leaf paste to the thickness of a 
quarter of an inch. Cover it with Royal icing 
made of confectioner's sugar and the whites of 
eggs, mixed thoroughly together. Cut into strips 
one by three inches, and bake in a moderate oven. 

Apple Tart Milanaise 

Line patty pans with leaf paste; pare and core 
apples, and chop rather fine. Put in enough to 
cover the centre. Over this place a layer of moist 
sugar, and bake. Covering the apples when baked 
with apricot jam will improve the flavor. 

Arrowroot Tartlet 

Mix two tablespoonfuls of arrowroot with enough 
cold milk to make a smooth batter moderately 
thick. Pour a pint of scalding hot milk on the 
batter, stirring constantly to keep it smooth. 
Set this on the fire a few minutes to thicken, but 
do not let it boil. Stir briskly or it will lump. 
When cold, add powdered sugar to taste, and stir 
in the yolks of three eggs well beaten. Line patty 
pans with leaf paste a quarter of an inch thick 
and put in them the mixture. Dust powdered 
sugar over them, and bake. A little nutmeg, or 
a little drained orange peel chopped fine, is an 
improvement. 

Here is hut Utile, and that light of digestion. 
— Frances Quarles. 

[22] 



Ascot Tartlet 

Mix a quarter of a pound of fine dry cocoanut, 
and the like quantity of powdered chocolate; 
sweeten with powdered sugar, and flavor with 
vanilla. Make into a soft paste with white of 
egg. Line patty pans with leaf paste, put the 
above mixture in, and bake. When cold add a 
teaspoonful of whipped cream to the centre of each. 

Bachelor Buttons 

Rub together two tablespoonfuls of butter and 
five of flour. Divide five tablespoonfuls of sugar 
into two parts; stir one into the flour, beat the 
other with one egg, and add to the rest. Flavor 
with a few drops of almond essence. Make into 
balls the size of a hickory nut with the hands, 
and sprinkle lightly with white sugar. Place on 
buttered paper, and bake slowly 

Banburys 

Cut leaf paste into six-inch squares. Into the 
middle of each put a large spoonful of jam. Fold 
in half and pinch the edges carefully together, 
being sure to make the joining tight. Fry in 
smoking hot fat to a golden brown. Drain and 
serve hot. 



In compelling man to eat to live nature gives 
appetite to invite him, and pleasure to reward him. 



[23] 



Bedford Jumbles 

Beat well together two cupfuls of sugar and one 
of butter. Add half a cupful of flour, half a 
teaspoonful of salt, four well -beaten eggs, one 
tablespoonful of vanilla, and flour enough to roll 
out. Grated cocoanut, or fine shredded almonds, 
sprinkled on each cake, is a delicious addition. 
Bake on greased tins. 

Berne Sandwich 

Roll out leaf paste, cut into pieces three inches 
square, cover the middle of each with apricot jam, 
wet around the edges, place a cover over same, 
close carefully, trim the edges neatly, and bake. 
When cold, ice carefully with water icing, and pipe 
according to fancy with red currant jelly. 



By an approved recipe make sponge cakes. Bake 
in small buttered cups or tins. When cold, cut 
a piece from the centre of each cake. Fill the 
cavity with ripe strawberries, and lay strips of 
angelica across to form handles. Serve whipped 
and sweetened cream with the berry baskets thus 
made. 



With weights and measures just and true, 

Oven of even heat; 
Well buttered tins and quiet nerves, 

Success will be complete. 

[24] 



Block Houses 

Roll and cut leaf paste into a thin sheet of about 
three-quarters of an inch in thickness. Cut into 
strips three inches long and half an inch wide. 
Bake in quick oven and form block houses by 
making squares of three pastry strips to each side 
overlapping the corners, fence fashion. Roll leaf 
paste in granulated sugar. Lay on pan with the 
sugar side up. 

Brambles 

One lemon grated whole, one cupful of raisins 
seeded and chopped fine, half a cupful of sugar, 
one egg, one tablespoonful of cracker dust. Roll 
leaf paste as thin as possible, put a layer on 
baking sheet, spread with the above mixture, and 
put on another layer of paste. Mark off with 
a pastry jagger in strips four inches long by two 
inches wide, and bake in a quick oven. These 
are good with a thin icing, and are delicious with 
cocoa or chocolate for luncheon. 

Another rich filling is made by chopping fine a 
quarter of a pound of figs, two ounces of citron, 
a quarter of a cupful of pistachio nuts or almonds, 
and two ounces of seeded raisins. Add one egg 
well beaten, and use as above. 



All the labor of man is for his mouth, and yet 
the appetite is not filled.

[25] 



Brownies 

Two small ciipfuls of sugar, one of milk, three of 
flour, three-quarters of a cupful of butter, four 
eggs, two squares of chocolate, two teaspoonfuls 
of vanilla, three of baking powder. Mix the cake, 
leaving half the milk, and dissolve the chocolate 
in this. Add the batter. Bake in very small 
cakes. While hot dip in eclair icing. 

Eclair Icing: Two squares of chocolate, five table- 
spoonfuls of powdered sugar, and three of boiling 
water. Mix the sugar and chocolate, and stir 
over the fire until smooth and glossy. Icing 
should never be more than lukewarm. 

Charlotte Baskets 

Beat the yolks of two eggs until thick and lemon 
colored, and add half a cupful of sugar gradually, 
continuing beating. Then add a teaspoonful and 
a half of cold water. Mix and sift one table- 
spoonful of cornstarch, half a cupful of flour, one 
teaspoonful of baking powder, and a pinch of salt. 
Add to the first mixture. When well mixed, add 
the rind of a lemon, and the well-beaten whites 
of two eggs. Bake in buttered gem pans fifteen 
or twenty minutes. Scoop out the centre and 
fill with whipped cream.

Charlotte Frankfort 

Line the individual charlotte moulds with lady 
fingers in three colors, pink, white, and chocolate. 
Fill in the centre with whipped cream a I'orange, 
and decorate with almonds and pistachio. 

Charlotte Russe 

Soak two tablespoonfuls of gelatine in a teacupful 
of milk. Beat together the yolks of ten eggs and 
half a pound of powdered sugar; place in a double 
boiler, with one cupful of milk. Mix until the 
whole begins to thicken. Add the gelatine, and 
strain into a large basin. Place this in a pan of 
ice, and when it begins to cool, add the whites of 
the eggs, well-beaten, half a cupful of sherry, and 
a pint of whipped cream. Stir well, pour into 
moulds that have been lined with sponge cake, 
and set away to harden. With the quantities 
given, twenty cups can be filled. The lining may 
be one piece of sponge cake hollowed out, or 
strips of the same, or lady's fingers. 



The pleasures of the table are common to all 
ages and ranks, to all countries and times; they 
not only harmonize with all the other pleasures, but 
remain to console us for their loss. 

[27] 



Cheese Roulettes 

Season with salt and cayenne a cupful of dry 
grated cheese — Parmesan preferred. Whip the 
whites of three eggs stiff, and mix in the cheese. 
Flour the hands, and mould the mixture into balls 
the size of walnuts. Drop into boiling fat, and 
fry to a golden brown. Lay on crumpled paper 
to absorb the grease. Serve hot. 



Cherry Tart 



Line six or eight tart moulds with leaf paste. 
Brush them with apple marmalade, fill with stoned 
cherries, sprinkle with powdered loaf sugar, and 
bake in a moderate oven for twenty minutes. 
Sprinkle powdered sugar on the edges and melt or 
glaze it in the oven for two minutes. Remove 
the tartlets, and let them cool. Turn them out 
of the moulds, cover with a thin coating of apple 
jelly, and serve with an ornamental dish paper. 

Chesterfields 

Scald half a pint of cream or milk, pour this over 
eight sponge cakes, and let it stand until cold. 
Add eight tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, four 
tablespoonfuls of flour, the yolks of four eggs, 
and the whites of two, previously well beaten. 
When well mixed add a little grated nutmeg, and 
put into patty pans lined with leaf paste. Dust 
with powdered sugar, and bake. 

A wise man seeketh not quantity, but sufficiency. 
[28] 



Chocolate Sponge Cake 

Two cupfuls of sugar, two cupfuls of flour, half 
a cupful of water, the whites of three eggs, and 
yolks of five, two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, 
and a pinch of salt. Beat the whites to a froth, 
add the sugar, then the beaten yolks, and the rest 
of the ingredients. Bake in thin loaves. Cut in 
fancy shapes after being baked. 

Frosting: Twelve tablespoonfuls of sugar, the 
whites of two eggs beaten stiff, and two squares 
of chocolate. Dissolve the chocolate in a double 
boiler, and mix with a white frosting. Frost each 
cake separately. This quantity will make twenty 
cakes. 

Chocolate Supreme 

Mix together two cupfuls and a half of sugar, and 
two cupfuls and a half of ground almonds. Beat 
the whites of seven eggs to a stiff froth, and add 
the almonds and sugar. Bake in drops on greased 
pans. 

Filling: A quarter of a pound of sweet butter, 
three-quarters of a pound of pastry cream mixed 
with a little cocoa. Put chocolate icing on top, 
and almonds around the outside.

[29] 



Chocolate Tartlets 

Four eggs, half a cake of grated chocolate, one 
tablespoonful of cornstarch dissolved in three 
tablespoonfuls of milk, four tablespoonfuls of 
sugar, half a teaspoonful of vanilla, a pinch of salt, 
and a heaping teaspoonful of butter. Rub the 
chocolate smooth in milk, heat over the fire, and 
add the cornstarch wet with milk. Stir until 
thickened, and pour out. When cold, beat in the 
yolks of the eggs, the sugar, and the flavoring. 
Bake in patty pans lined with leaf paste. Cover 
with meringue, and serve cold. 

Cocoanut Cakes 

Cream a teacupful of butter with a cupful of sugar, 
gradually adding two well-beaten eggs, a cupful 
of flour, a teaspoonful of baking powder, and three 
tablespoonfuls of grated cocoanut. Mix, pour into 
small gem pans, and bake in a hot oven for fifteen 
minutes. Turn out, and when cool, brush over 
with melted jelly, and roll in fine shredded cocoa- 
nut or blanched chopped almonds. Serve with a 
pistachio nut on top.

and a half of cut apples with three-quarters of a 
cupful of brown sugar, the juice and grated rind 
of half a lemon, and fill the pans. Cover with 
another layer of paste, and bake until well done. 
Lift the top crust and put a tablespoonful of 
boiled custard in each. Return the cover, and 
let it be ice cold when served. Whipped cream 
may also be used for filling. In this case, heap it

not have a bag and tube, the mixture can be put 
on the buttered sheet by spoonfuls. Brush over 
the top with a little beaten egg diluted with milk, 
before putting into the oven. Bake about twenty- 
five minutes. When cool, slit open at one side

Roll leaf paste one-third of an inch thick, cut into 
strips two inches long and an inch wide. Spread 
a baking dish thick with butter, and arrange the 
pieces of paste on it, placing them on their sides, 
leaving a small piece between them. Set them in 
the oven, and when they are firm and the sides 
spread, glaze them with the white of an egg, and 
dust with powdered sugar. When cooked, set 
them on paper to drain off any grease. They may 
be masked separately with a quantity of different 
colored jams. 



Line patty pans with a thin sheet of pie crust. 
Break three eggs into a quart of milk, add stale 
cake crumbs to form a stiff mass — just stiff 
enough to run easy. Before finishing the mixing 
add a good quantity of figs cut up rather fine; fill 
this mixture into the patty pans, and bake. Prunes 
may be substituted, but figs are better. A pinch 
of allspice will improve the taste.

the flour so as to give it the consistency of leaf 
paste. Let it remain for fifteen minutes, and in 
the meantime work half a pound of butter in a 
cloth until it is quite firm ; pat it into a flat square 
shape. Put the square of butter on the paste,

Maids of Honor 

Warm a quart of milk, add a tablespoonful of 
rennet, and let it stand by the side of the fire or in 
a warm place to get pretty hot, or until the curd 
is quite firm. Strain, and press out the whey. 
Put the curd into a pan or basin and rub it until 
quite smooth. Add a quarter of a pound of butter, 
a teacupful of sugar, and two eggs. Mix well, 
and add a little grated nutmeg, lemon juice to 
flavor, and a few currants. A stale sponge cake 
rubbed fine into this is an improvement. Roll 
some leaf paste to the thickness of a quarter of

teaspoonful of salt. Beat slowly at first and then 
faster until very stiff; whisk in two tablespoonfuls 
of fine granulated sugar; add the same quantity 
of sugar twice more, beating vigorously each time 
before more is added. Continue beating until 
the mixture can be cut with a knife. Add as much 
more granulated sugar as remains of a cupful, 
less the tablespoonfuls taken out, and fold into 
the mass lightly and smoothly. Dredge a light 
buttered baking sheet with flour; drop the mix- 
ture on the paper, giving each tablespoonful an 
oval shape. Dust these with fine granulated 
sugar, and bake in a cool oven until a light brown. 
These should dry out rather than bake at first. 

Mince Tarts 

In the centre of a four-inch square of leaf paste

beaten whites of three eggs. Bake in two layers 
in a moderate oven, using oblong pans. 

Filling: Half a cupful of strong, clear coffee, and 
half a cupful of milk. Heat in a double boiler; 
add to this two heaping teaspoonfuls of flour, a 
cupful of sugar, and the well-beaten yolks of four 
eggs. Cream two tablespoonfuls of butter, and 
add slowly to the custard when cool. This makes 
it light. When the cake is cold cut it in blocks 
four inches long by two inches wide; put two 
blocks together with mocha cream between, dip 
in caramel icing, and cover all over with chopped

these on a baking dish a little distance apart so 
they will not join when spreading, and bake in 
a quick oven. Remove and mask half of them with 
raspberry or strawbe^rry jam, and place the other 
half on top. Ice them with colored icing, arrange 
tastefully on a fancy dish, and serve. Pastry 
cream is used a great deal for filling. 

Noisettier

eight eggs, keeping the pan over the fire. When 
the cream is of good consistency, pass it through 
a fine sieve, rubbing it with a wooden spoon into 
a basin, where it may be kept until required for 
use. If the cream is liked very thick, more eggs 
may be added. 

Peach Crusts 

Roll leaf paste an eighth of an inch thick, cut it 
in two- and -a- half -inch squares, and bake in a 
hot oven. Cool, press down the centres, and ar- 
range on each half a canned peach drained from 
syrup and heated in the oven. Sprinkle with pow- 
dered sugar, and put brandy into each cavity.

or four eggs. Mix into a medium stiff paste with 
molasses. Roll leaf paste into one-eighth inch 
sheets, cut it in two, lay one sheet on a level 
baking pan with an inch high side to it, water- 
wash it, lay on a three-quarters of an inch thick 
filling, level it, water-wash it, and lay on the other 
sheet of paste. Dock it, water-wash it again, and 
bake. When baked and cold, cut it into strips.

and a half of cornstarch and a teaspoonful and a 
half of baking powder into a cup, fill the rest of the 
cup with flour, and add a quarter of a teaspoonful 
of salt; sift them together several times, and add 
to the mixture. Mix thoroughly, and add the 
well-beaten whites of four eggs, and one tea- 
spoonful of vanilla. Bake in a shallow pan, cool, 
and cut in shapes with small round cutter. Split 
and remove a small portion of the cake from the 
centre of each piece. Fill cavities of half the 
pieces with whipped cream, cover them with the 
remaining pieces, and press firmly together. Dip 
cakes in icing and decorate the tops with pistachio 
nuts or glace cherries. 

Rich foods which custom requires. 
[56] 



Pilac Suit 

Roll out a rich biscuit dough about as thick as 
pie crust. Spread with hot butter, use any fruit 
for the filling, and sweeten it well. Roll it like 
a jelly cake, and cut it in pieces about five 
inches long. Pinch the ends together to keep the 
fruit from oozing out. Set the pieces in a well- 
buttered tin, and bake. Turn them so they will 
brown delicately on both sides. 

Pithivier 

Roll out thin leaf paste, and put frangipane on it. 
Roll out another leaf paste, a little thicker, put 
on top of the frangipane, and brush with eggs. 
Bake in a moderate oven. 

Frangipane: Rub four tablespoonfuls of flour 
smooth in a quarter of a pint of cream. Add three 
ground macaroons, four tablespoonfuls of powdered 
sugar, the grated peel of a lemon, a little citron 
cut fine, and a dash of brandy. Put all into a 
saucepan and let come to a boil, stirring slowly to 
prevent lumps. When thoroughly cooked, take 
from the fire for a minute, and stir in the beaten 
yolks of four eggs. Stand the saucepan in another 
of boiling water and return to the stove, stirring 
until the eggs seem done — about five minutes 
if the water boils all the time. 



Cookery is not only an art but a master-art, 
[57]

starch, half a cupful of flour, and one teaspoonful 
of baking powder, and add gradually to the other 
mixture. Flavor with a teaspoonful of vanilla, 
and bake in patty pans for fifteen minutes. 



Roll leaf paste out thin and cut it into two and 
a half inch squares; brush each square over with 
the white of an ^gg, and fold over the corners 
until they meet in the middle. Slightly press 
them together, and brush over with the white of 
an egg, dust with sugar, and bake in a quick oven 
for fifteen minutes. When done, make a hole in 
the middle, and fill it v/ith jelly, jam, or marmalade. 



Roll half a pound of prunes slowly until soft, pit, 
add two tablespoonfuls of sugar, half a teaspoon- 
ful of cinnamon, the juice and rind of a lemon, 
and a tablespoonful of grated stale bread. Cut leaf

pounds of seeded raisins, and a pound of currants. 
Chop the currants and raisins very fine, and put 
them in an earthen bowl; add the rind and part 
of the juice of a small lemon, and a wineglassful 
of brandy. Roll out leaf paste a little thicker 
than for pies, and cut it into pieces four inches 
long and three inches wide. Put on fruit so that 
the crust may be turned over, and the edges 
brought together. Close the ends and lay the 
cakes in tins with a space between. Bake in a 
slow oven, and do not let them brown. Roll in 
powdered sugar. 

Quillet Cafe 

Cut thin sponge cake into squares; fill between 
two squares and cover the top with Mocha 
cream. Sprinkle all over with chopped roasted 
almonds, and garnish with white half almonds. 

Mocha Cream: Half a cupful of strong, clear

Beat a large egg well, stir in a tablespoonful of 
sugar, a speck of salt, and five drops of vanilla. 
Add a tablespoonful of water, and stir in a cupful 
of sifted flour very gradually. Knead on the 
board until smooth; a very little more flour may 
be needed for rolling, but be sparing, as the dough 
must be rolled very thin. Roll as thin as ordinary 
pasteboard, and cut into strips four inches long 
and an inch wide. When all are cut, slit each 
down the centre to within an inch of either end. 
When ready, drop into hot fat, clip one end

Pies 



Simplicity talks of pies. 

— Nathaniel Parker Willis. 



[69] 



Pies 

Pies, it is supposed, had their origin in the four- 
teenth century. They have come into world- 
wide favor as a dessert since that time, and New 
England housewives are so partial to them that 
they offer them for breakfast. 

The first fresh fruit pies of the season have a 
flavor different from and more delicious than those 
made of older fruits, and are therefore hailed 
with delight in every family that knows them. 

Pie crust should be light and flaky; it is then a 
delight to the epicure and has no terrors for the 
dyspeptic. Some cooks still cling to the old- 
fashioned method of making pies with large quan- 
tities of doughy paste. This is to be regretted, 
for soggy pies are not only hard to digest, but 
dull the brain and leave the body sluggish. 

A pie properly made, well baked, and offered 
while fresh, may rightly complete any luncheon 
or dinner the earlier courses of which are somewhat 
light. 



[71] 



Pie Crust 

Rub a pound and a half of flour, with half a pound 
of butter and half a pound of lard; add three 
ounces of sugar and half an ounce of salt, dis- 
solved in half a pint of water; mix well and lay 
away in a cool place. Leaf paste also makes 
delicious pies. 

Apple Pie {green) 

Line a tin with pie crust. Fill with pared and 
sliced tart apples. To the apple add a teaspoon- 
ful of butter and a mixture of half a cupful of 
sugar — more if liked very sweet — a slight dash 
of salt, and an eighth of a teaspoonful of any 
spice preferred, nutmeg, cinnamon, allspice, or 
grated lemon rind. Mix carefully till the butter 
and sugar melt. Roll the top crust, and lay it 
on, lightly pressing the edges together. 

For festive occasions cover the top with whipped 
sweet cream; or with a meringue of two egg 
whites and two heaped tablespoonfuls of pow- 
dered sugar, flavored with lemon juice, lightly 
browned.

[721 



Apple Pie (grated) 

For one pie, seven or eight apples peeled and 
grated. To the yolks of two eggs add a cupful of 
sugar, a heaping teaspoonful of pounded almonds, 
and half a teaspoonful of powdered cinnamon.

berries slightly dredged with flour, sprinkle with 
sugar and a slight pinch of salt, cover and bake 
from forty-five to fifty minutes in a moderate 
oven. 

Boston Custard Pie 

Beat the yolks of three eggs to a cream. Sift 
together several times, one tablespoonful of flour 
and three tablespoonfuls of sugar. Add it to the 
yolks, and put in a pinch of salt, a teaspoonful of 
vanilla, and a little grated nutmeg. Next add 
the well-beaten whites of the eggs and a pint of 
scalded cream which has been cooled. Mix this 
in gradually, turn it into a deep pie pan lined 
with leaf paste, and bake for half an hour. 

Let your pie be a joy to the stomach, not a surprise. 
— ^JoHN Jarvis Holden. 
[73] 



Cherry Pie 



Red cherries make the best pies. Line a deep 
pie plate with pie crust, and fill nearly full with 
stoned cherries. Sprinkle it over with four large 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and dredge lightly with 
flour. Cover with an upper crust of leaf paste 
rolled out thin, turn the edges, and make vents 
in the centre. Press the edges lightly together to 
prevent juice from escaping. Serve the day it 
is baked. 

Chocolate Pie 

A cupful of milk, a cupful of sugar, a tablespoon- 
ful of butter, the well-beaten yolks of two eggs, 
a tablespoonful of cornstarch, and two heaping 
tablespoonfuls of grated chocolate. Cook until 
thick, flavor to taste, and put in a crust previously 
baked. It may be covered with meringue. 

Meringue: Beat the whites of two eggs until 
stiff". Put in two tablespoonfuls of sugar, pour 
over the pie, and set in an oven to brown.

[74] 



Cocoanut Pie 

Put half a cupful of grated cocoanut to boil in 
one and one-quarter cupfuls of milk. Beat two 
eggs and a cupful of sugar to a froth, and add a 
tablespoonful of butter. Mix with the milk and

Cream Pie 

Line three pie plates with leaf paste. Bake in a 
quick oven fifteen or twenty minutes. When done, 
take them from the oven and stand aside until 
wanted. Put a pint of milk to boil in a double 
boiler. Moisten a tablespoonful of cornstarch 
with a little cold milk. Put it into the boiling 
milk and stir constantly until it thickens. Add 
half a cupful of sugar. Beat the whites of four 
eggs to a stiff froth, stir them carefully into the 
boiling mixture, take it from the fire, and add the 
juice and rind of one lemon, or a teaspoonful of 
vanilla. Fill the shells of baked paste with this 
mixture, and put in the oven until brown. Cover 
the paste with another pie plate when baking 
to keep the edge from falling. 

Custard Pie 

Beat two eggs slightly, add three tablespoonfuls 
of sugar, a pinch of salt, and a cupful and a half 
of milk. Line a deep plate with pie crust, strain 
in the mixture, and sprinkle liberally with grated 
nutmeg. Bake in a quick oven at first to set the 
rim, and decrease the heat, as the eggs and milk 
need to be cooked at a low temperature.

top. Chop the meat fine, and add to it eight 
pounds of apples, three quinces, three pounds of 
sugar, two cupfuls of molasses, two quarts of cider, 
two pounds of chopped raisins, two pounds of 
sultana raisins, three pounds of currants, and half

[78] 



Peach Meringue Pie 

Line a tin with pie crust, prick the bottom so that 
it may not rise in bubbles, and bake five minutes. 
Have ready enough canned peaches to fill the crust. 
Lay them in place with a little of the syrup and 
enough sugar to sweeten ; the quantity will depend 
upon the fruit itself. Bake until the crust is done, 
and the fruit tender. In the meantime beat the 
whites of eggs stiff, add half a cupful of sugar, and 
when the pie is cooked, pile the meringue on top 
of the fruit. Return to a cool oven to cook and 
delicately color the meringue. Serve either hot 
or cold. 

Pineapple Pie 

Cream a cupful of granulated sugar and two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, add the yolks of three eggs 
beaten light, four slices of pineapple chopped fine,

sugar, half a teaspoonful of mixed spices, two 
tablespoonfuls of molasses, six partly-beaten eggs, 
and a pint of milk. Line a deep tin with pie 
crust, pour in the pumpkin, and bake in a moderate

dish with pie crust, fill with rhubarb, and sprinkle 
liberally with sugar, adding a pinch of salt. Shake 
over a little flour. Cover with leaf paste, and 
bake in a quick oven.

Cakes 

Among all civilized peoples the cake is an institu- 
tion, a symbol of birthdays, marriages, and all 
the joyful events of life. Pleasant superstitions 
have grown around it; delightful memories afford 
it surroundings commensurate with its intrinsic 
goodness. From childhood to old age it shines, 
the culminating feature of gala days and festal 
nights. 

Herein are collected the approved recipes of older 
days, and the last word of our modern ingenuity 
and taste. Once there was a little girl who bore 
as a painful recollection throughout her life that 
she had had but six of the seven kinds of cake a 
bountiful hostess once provided for her. Let no 
such shattered hope follow the reader of this chap- 
ter. Were there a hundred kinds, none deserve 
neglect. 



[85] 



Cake-Making 



special attention must be paid not only to exact 
measurements, but also to correct methods of 
manipulation. Use none but the best materials. 
Flour, sugar, and all dry Ingredients must be 
sifted several times before measuring. Eggs must 
be well beaten, the yolks to a thick cream, and the 
whites to a stiff froth. Eggs beat much lighter 
and quicker when very cold. Spices should be 
ground to the finest powder. Fruits should be 
very dry or the cake will be heavy. 

Cream the butter with the hand or a large spoon, 
add the sugar, and cream again until very light. 
Put in the yolks, spices, and flavoring, and beat 
again. Add milk and flour alternately until all 
are used, and beat vigorously until very smooth. 
Last add the fruit and the beaten whites. 

Loaf cake requires less heat than thin cakes. If 
the oven is too hot at first or if suddenly cooled 
while the cake is baking, the cake will be soggy. 
If cake rises and cracks in the centre, too much 
flour has been used. When It browns before 
rising, the oven is too hot. Without perfect con- 
trol of the fire, do not attempt to bake cake.

Almond Cake 

Rub half a cupful of butter and two cupfuls of 
sugar to a smooth white cream. Add four eggs, 
one at a time, beating three or four minutes 
between each. Sift a pint of flour and one and 
a half teaspoonfuls of baking powder together, 
add to the mixture with half a cupful of blanched 
almonds, a glass of brandy and half a cupful of 
milk. Mix into a smooth batter, bake in a mod- 
erate oven for twenty minutes. 

Almond Cake a la Russe 

A pound of ground almonds, a pound and a quarter 
of sugar, six whole eggs, a dash of vanilla, a little 
rum, and six whites of eggs whipped very stiff.

Angel Cake 



Take three and a half cupfuls of flour, half a 
cupful of cornstarch, a pound and a half of pow- 
dered sugar, two teaspoonfuls of cream of tartar, 
and two tablespoonfuls of vanilla sugar. Sift 
several times. Whip three pints of whites of eggs, 
adding by pinches, a tablespoonful of powdered 
sugar until stiff and smooth. Success depends 
upon the firm body and fine grain of this egg 
froth. Stir all gently and smoothly together; add 
two tablespoonfuls of vanilla, and a tablespoonful 
of lemon extract. Half fill three moulds, not 
buttered, and bake in a moderate oven for twenty 
minutes. Take them out of the oven, turn bot- 
tom up, and let stand on the horns of the pans 
until cold. This quantity can be reduced for a 
single cake. 

Angel Food 

Sift a teaspoonful of cream of tartar with a 
quarter of a pound of flour five or six times. 
Beat the whites of ten eggs to a stiff froth, add 
ten tablespoonfuls of sugar, and mix carefully- 
Add the flour, gradually stirring all the while, and, 
last, the flavoring. Turn quickly into an un- 
greased pan three-quarters full, and bake in a 
moderate oven — 260°F. — for forty-five minutes. 
Take from oven, turn pan upside down on a rest, 
and let it stand until the cake falls out. Coat 
with white icing.

Banana Cake 

Cream together half a cupful of butter, two cup- 
fuls of white sugar, and a pinch of salt. Add 
gradually a cupful of sweet milk, and two teaspoon- 
fuls of baking powder sifted with four cupfuls of 
flour. Stir until smooth, then add a teaspoonful 
of vanilla and the whites of three eggs well-beaten. 
Bake in layers. 

Filling: Peel three large ripe bananas and slice 
them lengthwise. Add the yolks of three eggs 
well beaten, and mix well together. Dissolve in 
a saucepan a cupful of sugar, and a third of a cup-, 
ful of water. Boil until the syrup candies. Add 
the banana and egg mixture a spoonful at a time. 
Cook ten minutes, stirring constantly. Remove 
from the fire and stir until cold. Spread on layers 
which must also be cool. This is better than 
other ways of making banana cake, as the filling 
will not soak into the cake.

Bride's Cake 

Two pounds of currants, and half a pound each of 
candied orange peel, citron and lemon, sliced thin. 
Blanch and bruise a pound of almonds, and grind 
a tablespoonful each of mace, cinnamon, cloves, 
and nutmegs to a powder. Whip four pounds of 
butter to a cream. Beat separately the whites 
and yolks of twenty eggs — the whites should be 
frothed. Take two pounds of sifted sugar, and 
half a pint of brandy, the same of sherry, and 
four pounds of pastry flour sifted several times. 
Put the creamed butter into a large basin and by 
degrees mix in the sugar, stirring it constantly. 
Next add the whites of the eggs, and beat all 
together with the yolks; then add the almonds, 
spices, and, very gradually, the flour, until all are 
thoroughly blended. Beat well, and add the cur- 
rants, sprinkling them in gradually so as to dis- 
tribute them equally, and finish by making all 
smooth with the brandy and sherry. Keep up 
the beating until all is ready for baking. A 
double paper, well buttered, must be put as a lining 
to the baking pan, and the mixture should not fill 
the pan more than three-quarters full, that it may 
have room to expand. Put a paper over the top and 
bake the cake in a moderately heated oven. When 
done, cover it with almond paste three-quarters 
of an inch in thickness. 

Almond Paste: Blanch a pound of sweet almonds 
and a dozen bitter almonds. Pound them in a

mortar to a smooth paste, and drop in once or 
twice during the process a Httle orange-flower 
water; add a pound of sifted sugar and as much 
white of egg as will make a soft stiff paste. When 
all are well mixed together lay the paste on top 
of the cake already baked, a little more than half 
an inch thick, as smoothly and evenly as possible. 
Put it in a cool place to dry. Then put sugar 
icing over this. 

Sugar Icing: Two pounds of powdered sugar and 
the whites of three eggs — not beaten. Beat well 
together. Add a teaspoonful of lemon juice a few 
drops at a time. When a smooth paste is pro- 
duced the icing is ready. It should be spread 
evenly over the cake (which has been already 
baked and allowed to cool) with hands wet with 
cold water. It may be colored if liked. 

If it is wished to ornament the cake with an ice 
beading, put a little of the icing into a sugar bag. 
Squeeze so the sugar will come out through the 
hole at the bottom in a thin stream and with this 
form any suitable devices on the cake. It may be 
ornamented in various ways, and, if one possesses 
originality, one can allow one's fancy full sway and 
there is hardly a limit to the variety of decorations 
that can be produced.

Caramel Cake 

Beat half a cupful of butter to a cream, adding 
gradually a cupful and a half of sugar, the yolks of 
two eggs, and a cupful of water. Add two cupfuls 
of flour sifted three times, and beat for five minutes. 
Add three teaspoonfuls of caramel syrup, one tea- 
spoonful of vanilla, and another half cupful of 
flour. Beat again thoroughly, and stir in care- 
fully two teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and 
the well-beaten whites of two eggs. Bake in three 
layers in a moderate oven. 

Caramel Filling: Boil a cupful of granulated 
sugar, and a cupful of water until it will form a 
soft ball in a cup of cold water. Pour this on the 
well-beaten whites of two eggs, add a teaspoonful 
of caramel syrup, and a teaspoonful of vanilla. 
Beat until cool. 

Caramel Syrup: Set a cupful of sugar in an iron 
or granite pan, stir until sugar first softens, then 
melts, and finally becomes a liquid and throws off 
intense smoke. It really must burn. Have ready 
half a cupful of boiling water. Remove the pan 
from the fire, add the hot water, stir rapidly, and 
boil until you have syrup. This is enough for 
three or four cakes.

of a cupful of sour milk. Sift two cupfuls of flour 
with half a teaspoonful of soda, three teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder, a quarter of a teaspoonful of 
salt, and a cupful of blanched almonds. Mix, and 
add half a teaspoonful of vanilla. Cook together 
until smooth, three squares of chocolate, a third 
of a cupful of sweet milk, and half a cupful of 
sugar. Cool slightly, and add to the cake mixture. 
Bake in two layers, and put White Mountain cream 
sprinkled with a few chopped almonds between the 
layers and on top.

Separate the whites and yolks of six eggs. Beat the 
yolks to a cream, and add two teacupfuls of

add two tablespoonfuls of milk or water, a pinch 
of salt, and flavoring. Add part of the beaten 
whites. Sift two cupfuls of flour and two tea- 
spoonfuls of baking powder together several 
times. Stir gradually into the mixture, enough to 
mix well. Add the remainder of the whites of eggs, 
and bake in three layers, filling the tins two- 
thirds full. 

Filling: Sift half a cupful of flour, a cupful of

Sponge Cake 



Six eggs, their weight in sugar, and half their 
weight in flour. Break and separate the eggs care- 
fully, beat the yolks and sugar until very light, 
then add the whites which have been beaten to a 
stiff froth. Mix carefully, and slowly sift in the 
flour. Put a quarter of a teaspoonful of baking 
soda into a tablespoonful of vinegar; stir until 
dissolved, and add quickly to the cake. Mix 
thoroughly, carefully turn into a well-greased 
large shallow pan, and bake in a quick oven for 
fifteen minutes. 

Filling: Put half a pint of milk to boil in a double 
boiler. Beat half a tablespoonful of cornstarch, 
two tablespoonfuls of sugar, and the yolks of three 
eggs together until light, then stir into the boiling 
milk until it thickens. Take from fire, add the 
juice and the rind of half an orange. Stand away 
to cool. This should be made before the cake. 
When the cake is done turn it carefully from the 
pan bottom side up, and spread it while warm 
with the filling. Cut the cake in halves and fold 
the bottoms together thus having two layers of 
cake with a thick layer of filling between. Cover 
the top with orange icing. 

Orange Icing: Take two tablespoonfuls of orange 
juice, a teaspoonful of lemon juice and two tea- 
spoonfuls of brandy. Add the grated rind of an

Sponge Cake No. 2 

Weigh any number of eggs in their shells — four 
will make a good sized cake — take their weight 
in granulated sugar, and half their weight in flour, 
with the grated rind and juice of one lemon. Beat 
the yolks until light in color and thick as cream, 
then add the sugar, and beat the mixture again 
until light. The lemon juice and rind should be 
added, then the flour, which must be sifted until 
light and full of air. The whipped whites should 
be folded in with great care. 

Sunshine Cake 

Beat the whites of eleven eggs until stiff, stir in a 
cupful of granulated sugar, beat the yolks of six 
eggs very light, flavor with a teaspoonful of orange 
extract, and add another half cupful of sifted

together, and fold in a cupful of flour, in which a 
teaspoonful of cream of tartar has been sifted. 
Mix as quickly as possible. Bake from fifty to 
sixty minutes in a slow oven.

Strawberry Short-Cake 
(home-made) 

Two cupfuls of flour, two large teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder, a pinch of salt, a tablespoonful of 
cornstarch, an egg, a cupful and a half of milk, 
and four tablespoonfuls of butter. Sift the dry- 
ingredients together. Beat the egg, and add it to 
the milk. Mix all to a thick batter, and bake in 
a well-buttered pan. When done, split with a 
very hot knife, butter each half slightly, and put 
between the slices the berries, which have been 
hulled, washed, sliced, covered with sugar and 
allowed to stand for half an hour. This cake may 
be covered with whipped cream, or it may be 
served with plain cream; but the best way is to 
serve it with the berry juice without cream. If 
baked in individual drops, they can be pulled 
apart instead of cutting with hot knife, although 
the hot knife does not injure the cake.

Puddings 



I have sat in the stocks for puddings 
he hath stolen. 

— William Shakespeare.

Puddings 



England, the mother country, is parent too of 
puddings, their authentic history running back 
through seven centuries or more. Like her pos- 
sessions, she has girdled the globe with them, and 
made them the inevitable accompaniment of 
several of our greatest festivals. Christmas with- 
out its plum pudding is fairly unimaginable! 

But it is not to the heavier puddings, toothsome 
as they are, that attention is alone invited. For 
children, tired professional men, and peoples of 
sedentary lives, there is no dessert so practical as 
the fluffy, airy puddings, made apparently of 
nothing, yet possessing the most nourishing of food 
elements. They are at once inviting, inexpensive, 
easily made, and appropriate on all occasions. 



[113] 



Angers Delight 



This is an imitation of brick ice cream, and for 
the hostess who desires something dehcate and in- 
expensive in the way of dessert, this recipe is 
highly recommended. Moisten four tablespoon- 
fuls of gelatine with a little water. When dis- 
solved add two cupfuls of boiling water, and six 
tablespoonfuls of sugar. Let the mixture come 
to a boil, and beat in the whites of six eggs, 
whipped to a froth. Beat until partially cool and 
stiff, and divide into three portions. Flavor the 
first portion with vanilla and spread in a layer 
mould, sprinkling the top with chopped nuts. 
Color the second portion with fruit or vegetable 
coloring, flavor with strawberry or lemon and 
spread over the first, sprinkling again with nuts. 
Flavor the third portion with vanilla and spread 
it over the second. Set on ice until firm, and 
serve with whipped cream. 



Your dressing, dancing, gadding, where 's the good 

in? 
Sweet lady, tell me, can you make a pudding? 

[114] 



Apple Custard 



Use mellow apples of medium size. Pare, core, 
and bake until tender in a slow oven. Press 
through a sieve. To each cupful of apple pulp add 
half a cupful of cream, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, 
a lump of butter the size of an egg, and two eggs 
beaten stiff. While the apple pulp is still hot, 
blend into it the butter. Heat the sugar until it 
is a syrup, and add first the yolks of the eggs, then 
the cream, and beat all vigorously. Pour into 
buttered cups, and bake in a moderately hot oven 
for fifteen minutes. Remove from the oven and 
quickly pour over it the beaten whites of the eggs, 
and return to the oven to brown. Set in ice box 
to chill, and serve with cream. 



Tell me what you eat and I'll tell you what you 
are. 

[115] 



Cherry Pudding 



This old southern pudding of sour cherries and 
cornmeal batter, boiled in a bag, is unsurpassed, 
either north or south. Make a good cornmeal 
batter, as for Johnny cake, with a cupful of fine 
cornmeal, half a cupful of flour, a tablespoonful 
of butter, half a teaspoonful of salt, an e%g, a 
teaspoonful of baking powder, and enough sweet 
milk to make a very stiff batter, as the juice from 
the cherries will thin it while cooking. Stir in all 
the rich, ripe, sour cherries that the batter can be 
made to hold, allowing a half cupful of sugar to 
each cupful of cherries. The pudding should be 
so full of cherries that the batter simply holds 
them together. 

Place in a long pudding bag, drop into a pot of 
boiling water, and boil steadily until the pudding 
is done. Rip the bag open at the end and down 
one side, roll out the firm, whole pudding, cut 
into thick juicy slices and serve hot with vanilla 
sauce, with butter and sugar creamed together, 
or with any rich pudding sauce.

Chocolate Marshmallow Pudding 

Soak a pint of soft bread-crumbs into a quart of 
new milk, add a well-beaten egg, three tablespoon- 
fuls of cocoa, a pinch of salt, and sugar to taste. 
Pour into individual earthen pudding dishes and 
bake for forty minutes. Have ready a pint of 
whipped cream, sweetened and flavored, fold in 
half a pound of marshmallows cut in small pieces, 
and heap on the pudding. Garnish each with a 
whole marshmallow and serve immediately. 

Delicate Pudding 

A cupful and a half of water, a cupful of sugar, and 
half a teaspoonful of salt, well mixed and brought 
to the boiling point. Wet three tablespoonfuls of 
cornstarch in a little cold water, stir into the boil- 
ing syrup, and cook for ten minutes. Beat the 
whites of three eggs to a froth, and whip the boil- 
ing mixture into them ; return to the fire one min- 
ute to set the egg, add half a cupful of lemon juice 
and a little of the grated rind. Turn at once into 
a border mould that has been dipped in cold water 
and set away to become ice cold. Serve with 
strawberries piled high in the centre or pour a 
soft custard around as a sauce.

Devonshire Pudding 

Beat the yolks of six eggs until very light and 
creamy, add six tablespoonfuls of, sugar and beat 
again. Mix four tablespoonfuls of cornstarch with 
enough milk to dissolve it. Add the juice from a 
can of peaches. Mix, and stir into a quart of milk 
just before it boils. Add a pinch of salt. Stir 
until it has thickened. Pour into a baking dish 
and place it in the oven until it will bear icing. 
Place over the top a layer of the canned peaches. 
Beat the whites of eggs to a stiff froth with two 
tablespoonfuls of white sugar to one egg. Pour 
over the pudding, and place in oven until it is la. 
light brown. 

Fig Pudding 

This pudding is quite as good as plum pudding, 
but not as rich. Chop fine a pound of figs; add a 
cupful of chopped suet, two cupfuls of bread- 
crumbs, three-quarters of a cupful of sugar, two 
tablespoonfuls of citron cut small, two well-beaten 
eggs, one tablespoonful of molasses, two table- 
spoonfuls of milk, one teaspoonful each of soda and 
salt, and half a teaspoonful of nutmeg. Put into a 
mould and steam two hours. Serve with hard 
sauce. Instead of creaming butter and sugar to- 
gether for the hard sauce, stir into it a cup of 
stiff whipped cream and the white of one egg 
beaten until light. It is delicious, and goes 

further. 

Hunger is the best seasoning for meat, and 
thirst for drink.

the beaten whites of the eggs, then the brandy 
and spices, and the fruit well dredged with flour. 
Mix all well, put in a pudding dish, and steam 
from four to five hours.

[1191 



Rich Brandy Sauce: A cupful of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar, and a cupful of 
brandy. Beat the butter to a cream, add the 
sugar gradually, and, when very light, add the 
brandy, which has been made hot. Place the 
bowl in a basin of hot water, and stir for two 
minutes. The sauce should be smooth and foamy. 

Hard Sauce: A cupful of icing sugar, and a half 
cupful of butter beaten until very light. Flavor

tablespoonful of grated chocolate, and pour into 
the same mould on top of the white; color the next 
part with a half teaspoonful of fruit coloring, and 
pour on top of the chocolate; color the last part 
with the yolk of an egg, and pour all into the 
mould. Let each part get stiff first, before put- 
ting the other over. Cut in slices and serve with 
whipped cream. 

Noodle Custard 

Boil half a pound of dry noodles in salt water for 
twenty minutes, drain, cover with cold water, and

walnut. Put this over the noodles and bake about 
half an hour. Serve warm. It may be eaten 
with sweet milk or cream.

Orange Roly-Poly 

Sift two teaspoonfuls of baking powder with two 
cupfuls of flour; rub into it a tablespoonful of 
butter and one of lard ; add half a cupful of milk, 
and roll out the dough into a sheet about half as 
wide as it is long. Spread this with four sweet 
oranges sliced and seeded; sprinkle with sugar, 
roll up the dough with the fruit inside, pinching 
the ends together that the fruit may not seep 
out. Tie the pudding up in a cloth, allowing it 
room to swell, drop into a pot of boiling water,

of mashed prunes, then another tablespoonful of 
batter. Put the cups in a steamer or pan of hot 
water, and cook until the dough will not stick to

two cupfuls of clear boiling water. Flavor with 
nutmeg, and add a tablespoonful of butter.

half a teaspoonful of vanilla. Fold in the prunes. 
Pour the mixture into a buttered baking dish, 
place in a pan of hot water, and bake in a moderate 
oven for ten minutes; remove the cover to allow 
the pudding to brown slightly. Serve cold in 
glass cups with whipped cream.

Pudding Sauce 



Put a quart of water, a lemon and a small orange, 
sliced, a piece of whole cinnamon, and a quarter 
of a pound of sugar into a sauce pan, and let them 
boil for ten or fifteen minutes. Pour in an ounce 
of corn-starch, mixed with half a cupful of water, 
and stir for about a minute. Flavor with any 
wine desired. 

Queen of Puddings 

A pint of bread crumbs, a quart of boiled milk, a

frosting. Mix the other ingredients and, after 
baking nearly an hour, spread the pudding with 
a layer of raspberry jam, or other preserve, and 
with the frosting. Return to the oven and brown. 



Eating is a necessity, but cooking is an art, 
[125] 



Rice Pudding 



Wash half a cupful of rice in cold water, and put 
it in a double boiler with a quart of scalded milk. 
Cook quickly until tender; add two tablespoon- 
fuls of sugar, two tablespoonfuls of butter, and 
half a teaspoonful of salt. Beat an egg until light, 
and add it to the rice, cooking for one minute. 
Pour it into the dish in which the pudding is to 
be sent to the table. Mix two tablespoonfuls 
of sugar with a third of a teaspoonful of ground 
cinnamon, and sprinkle over the top of the pud- 
ding. Cut two tablespoonfuls of butter into tiny 
bits and drop them at regular intervals over the 
pudding. When the butter melts the sugar and 
cinnamon will form a rich looking brown sauce. 
Serve hot. 

Steamed Apple Dumplings 

Pare and core tart cooking apples. Envelop each 
in a layer of biscuit dough rolled as thin as pos- 
sible. Place the dumplings in a baking pan, and 
sprinkle them plentifully with cinnamon and bits 
of butter. Half cover them with water and sugar 
to make a syrup. Steam for thirty minutes.

quarters of flour, half a cupful of sweet milk, a 
cupful of raisins, butter the size of a butternut, 
a teaspoonful of soda, and a little nutmeg. Steam 
one hour. Eat with wine sauce. 

Wine Sauce: A heaping tablespoonful of butter 
and a cupful of fine sugar, beaten to a cream. 
Add a glass of wine. Grate a little nutmeg over 
it. Serve cold. If wanted hot, boil half a pint 
of water with a tablespoonful of flour, add to it 
the other ingredients, and set over the top of the 
tea-kettle three or four minutes before sending to 
the table. 

Suet Pudding 

Sift a cupful of flour into a mixing bowl, add to 
it a teacupful of chopped suet, a teaspoonful of 
salt, a teaspoonful of cinnamon, a cupful of Sul- 
tana raisins, and a cupful of currants. Mix dry, 
and add one cupful of molasses and one cupful of 
milk. Mix thoroughly and steam for two hours. 
The batter must be stiff as for fruit cake. By 
dividing it into two or three parts, using tin cans 
to suit the size of the family, only one pudding 
need be heated or cut at one time. It can be 
made in advance, like fruit cake, and reheated by 
steaming when wanted. It will keep for several 
weeks during cold weather. Serve with hard 

sauce.

an hour, drain, add to a quart of scalded milk, 
and cook in a double boiler for thirty minutes.

this over the tapioca gradually, and turn into 
buttered pudding dish. Bake thirty minutes in a 
slow oven. Serve with Madeira sauce. 

If apple tapioca is desired, fill the pudding dish 
half full, put steamed sliced apples with cinnamon 
in the centre and fill the dish with the rest of 
the tapioca.

Ices and Ice Creams 



A perpetual feast of nectared sweets 
where no crude surfeit reigns. 

John Milton (Comus). 



[129] 



Ices and Ice Creams 

Alexander the Great, who loved all the good things 
of life, is supposed to have been the first to intro- 
duce ice at the table. It has been constantly 
growing in favor ever since, until to-day ices, ice- 
creams, and frozen sweets are the most popular 
desserts on the menu among grown-ups as well as 
children. As the final course to a hearty dinner, 
their varying forms and diversified colors are as 
gratifying to the eye as to the replete appetite. 

The winter-logged system naturally craves these 
cooling refreshments during the hot days, and in 
the sick-room they are of inestimable value. The 
long standing prejudice that they are troublesome 
to prepare seems to have disappeared, and with 
the modern contrivances for making and moulding 
frozen desserts, the accomplishment requires 
neither much time nor patience.

Maple Walnut Meringue 

A large spoonful of maple walnut ice-cream is

which shred and mix with pulverized sugar. 
Refill shells, and place a spoonful of vanilla ice- 
cream on top. Garnish as desired. 

Pineapple Water 

This is not an ice-cream but an ice with all the 
fluffy whiteness of a cream, yet without the 
satiating richness of the latter. It is quite differ- 
ent from the ordinary ice, being especially light 
and delicate in character, and as delightful to the 
palate, as to the eye. No gelatine is required for 
this ice, egg whites giving it body as well as its 
creamy whiteness.

Roman Cream 

Put five ounces of sugar into a saucepan with a 
pint of milk, a small piece of cinnamon, and an 
ounce of gelatine, and place it on the side of the

scalloping it around the edge. Chill this bowl. 
When ready to serve, fill the bowl with the frozen 
mixture, and serve at the table in punch cups. 

If I bring thee not something to drink, I will 
give thee leave to die. 

— Shakespeare. 

[1381 



White Parfait 

The whites of three eggs, one cupful of sugar, one 
small cupful of water, a pint of cream, and two 
tablespoonfuls of chopped almonds. Boil the 
sugar in the water until it threads. Pour this over 
the beaten whites, and heat. When cold, add 
whipped cream, nuts, cherries, or marshmallows 
cut in pieces. Pack and freeze. 

Winter Memories 

This ice is particularly dainty and cool looking. 
It consists of snow-white mint sherbet garnished 
with bits of green mint jelly, and sprigs of fresh 
mint leaves dusted with powdered sugar. It is 
most refreshing when served on a hot day. 



He who eats the fowl alone, will have to saddle 
his horse alone.

Fruit Desserts 



I will make an end to my dinner; 
there^s pippins and cheese to come. 

— Shakespeare. 



[141] 



Fruits 

Fruits have been a great factor in man's diet ever 
since Eve made their acquaintance that unfor- 
tunate day in the Garden of Eden. Their nutri- 
tive value is not high, yet they are important, 
nevertheless, and should be served generously 
throughout the year. 

Americans are too prone to serve raw fruits only 
in their season, neglecting the many sensible uses 
the Germans make of them when cooked. Mix- 
tures of fruits, both raw and cooked, are almost 
numberless. Thus the ambitious housewife, eager 
for new dishes, can produce delightful treats by 
experimenting. For an emergency dessert they 
are easily first favorites, because of the little time 
it takes to prepare them. 



[1431 



Ambrosia 

Slice pineapple very thin or pick it apart from the 
centre with a fork, sprinkle it thick with sugar, 
and cover the top with grated cocoanut. Decorate 
with pineapple leaves. 

Angers Snow 

Pare, and grate the meat of one cocoanut. Peel 
and cut a dozen oranges in small pieces, taking 
out the seeds. Put a layer of orange in the bot- 
tom of a pretty glass dish, sprinkle with sugar, 
then a layer of cocoanut, then a layer of orange, 
sugar, and so on until the dish is full, having the 
last layer cocoanut. Let it stand for an hour. 

Apple Porcupine 

Core large perfect apples, fill with cinnamon and 
sugar, and bake. Chill the whites of two eggs, 
and whip with one cupful of sugar, and the grated 
pulp of a raw apple until thick and white. When 
cold, coat the baked apples thickly with this mix- 
ture, stud with split blanched almonds, and serve. 



Comfort me with apples, 

— The Song of Solomon. 

[144] 



Apple Puree 

Pare, quarter, and core six apples; stew quickly 
until tender. Pass through a sieve, add a cupful 
of sugar, and put on the fire again to cook until 
thick. When cool, add the juice of five lemons, 
and beat while standing in ice water until very 
white and foamy, and quite stiff. Stir in a scant 
cupful of fruit, cut small. Mould, and serve with 
thin rounds of apple cooked tender in equal 
measures of sugar and water. Flavor the syrup 
with lemon juice, and pour over the apple puree. 

Apple Trifle 

Boil five apples to a pulp, sweetening to taste. 
When cool, place in a large bowl, together with 
the white of one egg, the juice of one lemon, and 
a cupful of sugar. Beat the mixture about thirty 
minutes with a wire egg beater. The result is 
three times the amount one started with, enough 
to serve ten people. 

Bananas au Cerise 

Skin and slice three bananas, sugar to taste, add 
a liqueur-glassful of maraschino and a wine- 
glassful of sherry. Serve very cold. 



A surfeit of the sweetest things 
The deepest loathing to the stomach brings. 

— Shakespeare. 

[1451 



Banana Snow 

Three bananas, the juice of half a lemon, four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and the white of one egg. 
Break up the bananas, and cream them with a 
fork. Add the lemon juice and sugar, and beat 
well. Then add the white of egg, and beat all 
together until stiff. Serve cold. 

Banana Sponge 

Dissolve two tablespoonfuls of gelatine in two 
tablespoonfuls of cold water; in a quarter of an 
hour pour over this a pint of boiling water, stir 
into it the juice of one lemon and a cupful of sugai . 
Let the gelatine fully dissolve, strain, and cool. 
Cut three bananas into small pieces and beat them 
to a pulp; then whip the whites of two eggs, and 
beat into the banana cream. When the gelatine 
is cold beat it into the eggs and bananas, a little 
at a time till quite stiff. Serve with cream. 

Banana with Lemon Juice 

Wash and dry whole bananas. Cut their ends off 
square, and split in halves lengthwise. Divide the 
pulp in their skins into convenient mouthfuls, 
sprinkle with lemon juice, and with powdered 
sugar. Serve from skins. 



All human history attests 
That happiness for man — the hungry sinner — 
Since Eve ate apples, much depends on dinner. 

— Byron. 

[140] 



Cantaloupe 

Cantaloupes should be washed carefully before 
placing in the ice-box to cool. They should be 
cut in half, and served very cold, but never with 
chopped ice, as this makes them watery and taste- 
less. 

Cantaloupe Cocktail 

Cut in half and remove the seeds of a cantaloupe. 
Mix fresh pineapple cut in small pieces with stoned 
cherries, using half as much cherries as pineapple, 
and sprinkle liberally with sugar. Fill the halves 
of the melon with the pineapple and cherry mix- 
ture. Set in a pan of chopped ice until thoroughly 
chilled, and place three pitted cherries on each half 
of melon. 

Cherries au Rhum 

Wash, dry well, and pit a pound of cherries. Add 
sugar to taste, and half a pint of Jamaica rum. 
Set fire to it and serve while burning. 



That last cherry soothes a roughness of my 
palate. 

— Robert Browning. 

[147] 



Cherry Jelly Nests 

Set a small mould within a larger on a little ring 
of tin that will hold it up half an inch from the 
bottom. Soak a box of gelatine in a cupful of 
cold water for half an hour; add a quart of boiling 
water, and two cupfuls of granulated sugar. Mix 
in the whites of two eggs, and stir over the fire 
until the gelatine is dissolved. Pour into the 
small bowls, allowing a nest for each individual 
to be served. After filling the bottom of the 
bowls, set the small moulds on the little rings and 
fill in the space between the two moulds with 
gelatine. Set in a cool place to harden. Before 
serving remove the small moulds and rings, and 
fill the jelly nests with fresh cherries, chopped with 
powdered sugar. Keep in the ice-box until ready 
to serve. Turn out the jelly nest on a flat glass 
dish, dot a little whipped cream on the top of each 
cherry-filled nest, and serve. 

Flummeries 

Flummery is thickened fruit. The small fruits are 
preferred. Put a pint of blackberries into a pint 
of water over the fire, bring to boiling point, add 
two rounding tablespoonfuls of cornstarch mois- 
tened in six tablespoonfuls of water, and bring 
again to boiling point, stirring constantly. Add 
half a cupful of sugar, and turn out to cool. This 
may be eaten plain, with milk or with cream. 
Other fruits may be substituted. 

As at English Jeasts . . . to make the end 
most sweet. 

— Shakespeare. 

[148] 



French Trifle 

Soak a fresh baked cold jelly roll In a cupful of 
fruit juice; allow it to stand for an hour. Whip 
a cupful of cream, and add a tablespoonful of 
sugar and a teaspoonful of vanilla extract. Before 
serving, decorate it with the cream in horizontal 
lines, using a forcing bag and star tube. Garnish 
it with the stalk and leaves of angelica, and place 
here and there a few sugar roses. 

Fruit Chop Sooey 

Crush a quart of strawberries, and place it in dishes 
ready to serve, which have been lined with crisp 
lettuce leaves. Garnish the berries with small 
cubes of oranges. Beat the white of an egg to a 
stiff froth, sweeten to taste, drop it on the centre of 
the fruit, place a ripe berry in this, and add sliced 
bananas. This will serve six persons, and prove 
not only a palatable dish, but also an attractive 
and economical dessert. 



Method '5 more sure at moments to take hold 
Of the best feelings of mankind ^ which grow 
More tender, as we every day behold. 
Than that, all-softening, overpowering knell, 
The tocsin of the soul — the dinner bell. 

— Byron. 

[149] 



Fruit Whiff 

A pint of sweet cream, a quart of strawberries, a 
third of a box of gelatine, a cupful and a quarter 
of white sugar, the whites of four eggs, and a tea- 
spoonful of lemon extract. Mince the strawber- 
ries and sweeten; soak the gelatine, and add a 
little hot water; beat the whites of the eggs stiff, 
and the cream thick and light; strain the gelatine; 
add the flavoring, then the strawberries; beat all 
a few minutes, and set it in a cool place. 



Fruit Whip 



Sweeten to taste either strawberries, raspberries, 
nectarines, or peaches; mash the fruit, and to 
every quart allow the whites of four eggs, well- 
beaten. Set on ice, and serve with or without 
cream. 



Then to breakfast with what appetite you have. 

— Shakespeare. 

[1501 



Grapefruit Cocktail 

Cut the grapefruit in half, and carefully scoop out 
the pulp without any of the bitter white skin. 
Clean the sides of the shells, and throw them into 
cold water. Hull a pint of strawberries, mix them 
with the grapefruit pulp; add two tablespoonfuls 
of powdered sugar, and stand the mixture on 
ice. At serving fill the shells with the mixture, 
add a tablespoonful of ice shaved fine, and a 
tablespoonful of rum or sherry. Stand the shells 
on a dainty doily or a spray of fern, and send at 
once to the table. Maraschino gives a delicious 
flavor. Cut a very thin slice off the bottom of 
the shell so it will not tip. 

Iced Pears 

Select smooth medium-sized pears, peel and core. 
Stew until tender, remove from fire, and when 
cold fill the cavities with jelly and cover with 
icing made of sugar and white of an egg. Put 
cloves in the bottom ends. 



Not what we give, but what we share; 
For the gift without the giver is bare. 

[151] 



Jellied Apples 



Mix two cupfuls of sugar and two cupfuls of boil- 
ing water. Peel and quarter six tart apples, and add 
them to the sugar and water. Put them in a baking 
dish in the oven, closely covered, and bake until pink. 
Put the apples in a mould. Soak two tablespoon- 
fuls of gelatine in half a cupful of cold water, add 
the juice of an orange and a lemon, color pink if 
desired, pour all into the mould with the apples, 
and set it aside to become firm. Serve with soft 
custard or whipped cream. 

Marshmallow Icing 

Make a boiled frosting with a cupful of sugar 
and half a cupful of water. When it threads pour it 
over the beaten yolk of an egg. Spread a layer 
of icing between the cakes, and into each layer of 
icing press marshmallows cut in halves, setting 
them as quickly as possible. If they are put in 
while the cake and icing are warm, they will 
soften enough to blend well. If not warm, put 
in the oven for a minute or two. 



Who feeds himself with his alms, feeds three, 
Himself, his hungering neighbor, and ME. 

[1521 



Orange Custard 

Mix the juice and pulp of a lemon with a cupful 
of sugar, and about half a pint of water. Boil 
sufficiently to dissolve the sugar, and strain. 
Bring to a boil again, and stir in two tablespoonfuls 
of cornstarch, blended with a little cold water. 
Stir and boil slowly for ten minutes. When cool 
pour this mixture over three or four sliced oranges. 
This may be decorated with a meringue or served 
with sweetened or whipped cream. 

Pineapple Delight 

Boil two tablespoonfuls of rice until soft, and drain 
it. Dissolve a tablespoonful of gelatine in the 
boiling water and add the rice, and three-quarters 
of a cupful of sugar. Cool, and add a pinch of 
salt, two cupfuls of pineapple juice, and a cupful 
of whipped cream. Cool, and serve in dainty 
glasses with a cherry on the top of each. 

Strawberry Dessert 

Mash a quart of strawberries, and sprinkle with a 
cup of sugar. Let them stand for five or six hours 
— or even over night. Drain off the juice — there 
should be a cupful — and into this break ten or 
twelve marshmallows. Let them soak two hours. 
Add a pint of cream, whipped stiff, to the crushed 
strawberries, and serve at once in sherbet glasses. 
It is pretty to put a whole berry on each glass. 

// you will but speak the word, I will make you 
a good syllabub. 

— Walton. 

[153] 



strawberry Whip 

A cupful of crushed strawberries, a cupful of 
powdered sugar, and the well-beaten white of an 
egg. Put the ingredients into a bowl, and beat 
with a wire whisk until stiff enough to hold in 
shape. About thirty minutes will be required for 
beating. Pile lightly on a dish and chill. 

Syllabub 

Whip a pint of cream to a stiff froth, and stand it 
on ice. At serving time fill it into glasses, or 
serve on a large glass dish, dust thick with pow- 
dered sugar, and sprinkle either with chopped 
almonds, grated macaroons, or chopped candied 
fruits. This is one of the few desserts that can 
be made easily and quickly. 

Watermelon 

Scoop out watermelon balls with a Parisienne spoon. 
Serve them on a bed of shaved ice in grape-fruit 
cups, and garnish with a spray of fern. 



Sweets to the sweet: farewell! 

— Shakespeare.

'SALADS' 

BY 

OLIVE M. HULSE 

'SALADS', which is a complement of 'Desserts/ 
is the most complete work of the kind heretofore 
pubHshed. Every recipe reflects a master-hand 
in the art of salad-making. 

Among present-day epicures the fashionable din- 
ner is not a success which does not include a new 
salad. Science has demonstrated that various 
green fruits and vegetables, properly prepared, 
are nature's best method of refreshing and re- 
plenishing a tired mind and a tired body. This 
book treats the subject exhaustively. 

It contains a history of the salad, showing that 
leading thinkers of all times have been partial to 
such foods. 

It gives two hundred recipes of the newest and 
best combinations, each a masterpiece. 

It gives thirty recipes for making dressings — the 
keystone of the perfect salad. 

It is a companion book to 'Desserts' being the 
same in size, binding, type, color and price. 

It is written in comprehensible English. 
Every progressive woman should have SALADS. 
The price is ONE DOLLAR.
