EDIGATION. 



By way of expressing a most loving appreciation 
we dedicate THE BAPTIST COOK BOOK to those 
faithful and much encumbered k 'Marthas," who 
have, with kind hearts and diligent hands, spread 
upon the white cloth of its pages, the daintiest and 
the best of their kitchen knowledge, to furnish a 
feast for a cause of their Lord, which we happen to 
represent.

"Cooking means the knowledge of Medea and Circe and of Helen and 

of the Queen of Sheba. It means the knowledge of all herbs and fruits 

and balms and spices and all that is healing and sweet in the field and 

groves and savory in meats. It means carefulness and inventiveness 

and willingness and readiness of appliances. It means the economy of 

your grandmothers and the science of the modern chemist; it means 

much testing and no wasting; it means English thoroughness and French 

wit and Arabian hospitality; and in fine, it means that you are to be 

perfectly and always ladies — loaf-givers."

Soup. 

Always use cold water in making all soups; skim well, 
especially during the first hr., there is great necessity for 
thorough skimming and to help the skum to rise pour in a little 
cold water now and then and as the soup reaches boiling point 
skim. A little caramel added to the soup stock will give 
a rich brown color. For seasoning use bay leaves, taragon, 
mint, parsley, cloves, mace, celery seed and onions. Soup 
stock may be made and kept for many days in the winter and 
from it can be made various soups; stock made from meat 
without bone or gristle will not jelly; never boil vegetables 
with stock that is to be kept, as they will cause it to sour; 1 
qt. of soup will serve 4 persons.

FISH AND OYSTERS. 



"Not all on books their' criticism waste 
The genius of a dish justly taste." 

Fish. 

The flesh of all fish out of season is unwholesome; to be 
eatable they should be perfectly fresh, the eyes clear, the gills 
red, the scales bright, the flesh firm and free from any unpleas- 
ant odor; and to secure the best flavor, should be cooked as 
soon as possible after leaving the water. They should be scaled 
and cleaned as soon as they come from market, washed quickly 
without soaking, removing the smallest atom of blood. Sprinkle 
salt on the inside and put them in a cool place until wanted. 

Planked Fish. 

Planks of seasoned oak or other hard wood an inch thick are 
fashioned for this purpose. They are of various sizes. Some 
have wire supports at the back that admits of standing before 
an open fire. To these the fish are fastened with two or three 
tacks and the whole set in a dripping-pan. Anew board should 
be used each time. Oil or butter the heated board, put the fish 
in place, skin side down; brush fish with oil or butter, and 
season with salt. Bake about 25 min., basting frequently with 
melted butter. Serve the fish on the plank laid on a serving- 
dish. Fill the spaces between the fish and edge of the board 
with parsley or mashed potato. To put the latter in place, use 
a pastry-bag and tube. Brush over the potato with beaten 
yolk of egg; dilute with milk and return to the oven to brown 
the potato. Saratoga potatoes, radishes and slices of lemon are 
the garnishes. Spread the fish with butter just before sending 
to the table. B. M.

To Boil Ham. 

Wash and put to soak over night. In morning put in boiler,

time it begins to boil allow 15 min. to the pound. For instance, 
if the ham weighs 10 lbs. , let it boil 2J hrs. When half done 
turn it over in the boiler. Be sure to keep well covered with 
boiling water. When done set the boiler off and let ham stay in 
the water until it gets cold. This recipe is tried and true.

Meats and Game. 

In cooking meats our object is to retain the nourishment and 
flavor, consequently we must follow directions exactly the 
opposite from those of making soup. The flavor and juices 
of meat depend as much upon the method of cooking as upon 
the quality of the meat. If cold water and a moderate heat 
will soften the fiber and draw out the juices, boiling water or a 
strong, dry heat will retain them, by coagulating the albumen 
on the surface and to a certain depth within, thus enclosing the 
meat within a waterproof case or crust which neither permits 
the juices to flow out nor the water to penetrate within; in this 
way only is meat juicy and well flavored. 

Pot Roast. 

Five lb. beef roast, 1 qt. boiling water, 1 pod red pepper, 1 
tb. salt. Place meat in kettle over a good fire, brown on one 
side, turn and brown on the other. Now, add the boiling

That your success in cooking depends very largely upon the 
materials you use. A good cook and inferior ingredients made a bad 
combination and the result of this combination is inevitable a failure. 

Failures are expensive. They waste alike your labor and your 
money, to say nothing of the aggravation they cause. 

Then why have failures at all when it's so easy to avoid them? 
Follow the receipts in this cook-book and use only the best materials and 
ninety-nine times out of a hundred you will succeed. 

To furnish these materials is our part of the programme. Our long 
experience in the fancy grocery business has taught us three very good 
lessons: 

What goods to buy; When to buy them, and, most important of all, 
what goods to let alone. We have passed the experimental stage in our 
business, and feel that you can rely on our judgment. Purchase your 
materials from us, and no matter what article you buy, you can depend 
upon getting the finest quality and absolute freshness.

Chicken Croquettes. 

Take 1 4-lb. chicken, dress it, and boil till tender. While 
this is cooking prepare a set of sweetbreads by trimming off all 
fat and pipes. Wash well in cold water, soak 15 min., drain, 
cover with boiling water, add t. of salt, stand over a very- 
moderate fire for 20 min. When done throw them into cold 
water and remove fibrous skin from outside. Chop fine with 
silver knife. When chicken is done remove skin and bone; 
chop the meat very fine, then mix it with the sweetbreads, and 
to every pt. of this meat allow ^ pt. milk or cream, 1 large 
tb. butter, 2 large tb. Queen of Pantry flour, 1 large tb. 
parsley, 1 1. onion juice, 1 t. salt, Jt. nutmeg, cayenne pepper to 
taste. Now, put milk on to boil; rub butter and flour to a smooth 
paste and stir into boiling milk; stir continually until very 
thick; take from fire and add meat, and beat until thoroughly 
mixed; add seasoning; taste to see if enough salt and pepper; 
then turn on large plate to cool. When cold and hard, form 
into cone-shaped croquettes; dip first in beaten egg and then in 
bread crumbs. Now, put sufficient plantene in cold pan and 
heat up gradually. When hot enough, lay in croquettes and 
fry light brown; serve with a sprig of parsley on top of each. 
To warm over, place them on soft paper and stand them in the 
stove for a few moments. Cold roast chicken or turkey may be 
made into croquettes; you may use calf brains instead of sweet- 
breads, prepared in the same way. When the family is small, 
the white meat of the chicken may be used for salad, the dark 
for croquettes. With a pair of sweetbreads, a 4-lb. chicken will 
make a qt. of nice soup, 9 croquettes and 1J pts. of chicken

List of Vegetables to serve with Meat. 

Not more than 1 or 2 varieties of vegetables should 
accompany a course. 

With roast beef, the favorite methods of serving potatoes are 
Franconico or baked with the beef, escalloped, mashed — or 
mashed and browned. Other vegetables that may accompany 
the roast are cauliflower, brussels sprouts, new beets, beet 
greens, spinach, salsify, tomatoes, onions, squash, white 
turnips, green corn, peas, beans and rice, hominy, javina or

VEGETABLES. 



"Fruits, vegetables and doctors do not thrive together. " 
Vegetables. 

All vegetables should be used when as fresh as possible. 
Wash and let them lie in cold water till ready to use. Young 
green vegetables should be cooked in boiling salted water. 

Onions, if boiled in pure, soft water, are almost tasteless, and 
all the after salting cannot restore to them the sweet, saline 
taste, and the strong aroma which they possess when boiled in 
salted water. Strong flavored vegetables, like turnips, cabbage, 
and greens, should be put on in a large quantity of water. 
More delicate ones, such as green peas, asparagus, etc. , require 
less water. 

The cooking of potatoes is indeed an art ! They are dressed 
in some way in almost every family every day. The nutritious 
part of the potato lies near the skin; if pared at all, should be 
veiy thin. They are best cooked in the jacket, either boiled or 
baked. When boiled, they should be put on in just boiling 
water enough to cover them, without salt, and boil slowly, till 
nearly done, then throw in a c. of cold water; it will chill the 
surface, and the potatoes will be mealy throughout. When 
done drain off every drop of water and sprinkle with salt; leave 
off top and shake occasionally, and expose every side to the air. 
Remove skins and serve immediately in uncovered dish with 
butter, pepper and salt. 

Potatoes are more wholesome baked than boiled. If the 
shell of a baked potato is broken open, but not pulled apart, 
and put in a warm place, they will be as nice as when served 
right from the oven.

BREAD. 

"Truly, bread is the staff of life." 
Hints on Bread Making. 

Good bread should have first place on our table every day in 
the year. Three things are essential to good bread, viz: Good 
flour, good yeast and judicious baking, of course, might be 
added, experience, without which none of the domestic arts 
can be carried on successfully. One pint of liquid should be 
used with every loaf of bread. The excellency of bread 
depends much upon the thoroughness of its kneading. 
Kneading renders the gluten so elastic that it is capable of 
expanding to twice its bulk without breaking or cracking. 
Always give bread plenty of time to expand, but be careful 
that it does not fall, as it is then sour and nothing can be 
added to restore its original sweetness. As soon as bread is 
done remove it from the oven, tip it on the bread board so that 
the air can circulate around it. Do not cover if you like a 
sweet, crisp crust. When perfectly cold put it in a clean tin 
bread box without any wrapping, as cloth absorbs the moisture 
and soon sours and mould, destroying the flavor of the bread. 

To test oven, if one can hold the hand in the oven to 
count 20 it is right, or throw a little flour on the floor of the 
oven, if it browns quickly, it is right. Hot bread, or hot cake, 
.should always be cut with a hot knife. If so cut it will not 
become clammy. 

Quick Yeast. 

One c. fresh milk, boiled, 2 tb. meal, 1 pinch salt, set in a 
warm place until morning, then add 1 pt. of warm water. 
Make a batter by adding flour, set in a warm place to rise. 
When risen make bread in the usual way. J. B. S.

Yeast Cake. 

Take 1 qt. of good, fresh clabber; put it in a pan and let it

the consistency of mush; set off and let cool; dissolve in a little 
water 2 yeast cakes, stir in meal sufficient to make stiff dough. 
Do this early in the morning, and in the evening stir in more 
meal. Make out in cakes, and dry in the shade.

pour the essence into a bowl and keep to return to chicken 
when salad is made. All the meat can be used in the salad. 
Strip the meat from bones and cut in squares J in. thick; have

Many housekeepers use lard for pastry, but as it makes a 
greasy and brittle crust there is no doubt but that it is more 
indigestible than the light, flaky crust made from "Plantene." 
Take \ c. plantene, \\ t. baking powder, 1 t. salt, 1 pt. good 
pastry flour, sift flour, salt and baking powder together; with 
tips of fingers work in the plantene, and ice water enough to

adding the custard. Pricking the dough before baking prevents 

blistering.

The richest juices of any fruit lie immediately under the 
skin and around the core. Here, also is the gelatinous 
principle without which the fruit cannot jelly. Therefore 
do not make the mistake of peeling and coring any fruit 
for jelly. 

Cantaloupe Preserves. 

Take a melon half ripe, cut in pieces of equal size, peel off the 
rind and take out the seed. Soak in lime water for 6 or 8 hrs. 
(dissolving 2 handfuls of lime in 3 gals, of water). Change 
the pieces from top to bottom while soaking. Then soak in 
clear water, changing twice. Then scald in weak alum water, 
let them remain in until cold put again in cold water. 

Make a rich syrup, using \\ lbs. sugar to 1 lb. fruit. Strain 
the boiling syrup over the fruit and let stand until the next 
morning, turning a large dinner plate over to hold the fruit in 
the syrup. Next day boil slowly until tender and clear. 
Flavor as you like with lemon, vanilla or ginger.

fruit well done and transparent. If the flavor of ginger is liked 
make a strong tea and add to syrup. Cinnamon and cloves are

Mrs. James W. Armstrong. 

Pineapple Preserves. 

Pare the fruit, and with sharp pointed knife extract the eyes. 
With a silver fork tear fruit off the core in pieces of moderate 
size. Weigh fruit and to every pound of fruit add 1 lb. of 
sugar. Place in saucepan in alternate layers of fruit and sugar 
till all is used; allow a small cup of water to each pound of 
sugar. Heat slowly to boiling point. When the fruit has been 
scalded 3 minutes skim, then dip out the fruit putting it into 
platters, returning to kettle all syrup that drains from fruit. 
Boil syrup h hr., skimming frequently. Then add the pine- 
apple and boil 25 min., when it should be done. If the syrup 
is not as thick as desired skim out fruit once more, placing it 
on platters. Then boil syrup to desired thickness, cooling a 
little in saucer to test its thickness. Return fruit for final 
scalding and seal in jars. 

Mrs. Jordan. 

Fig Preserves. 

Peel the figs as thin as possible. Have a cup of lime dis- 
solved in a dish pan of water and drop the figs in as you peel 
them. Let them stand in the lime water about 2 hours, 
then wash them off, using a quantity of fresh water. One 
pound of fruit to f of a pound of sugar, add enough water to 
dissolve the sugar, let the sugar come to a boil before putting 
in the fruit. Let them boil slowly till they become transparent. 
About 10 minutes before taking them up drop a few drops of 
lemon in the preserves, it gives a flavor: don't use a whole 
lemon, as it does not require so much.

INVALID DIET. 

Scraped Beef. 

This is simply beef from which all indigestible substances 
have been removed. Take a tender piece of beef, cut across 
the grain, scrape with a spoon until all the pulp is removed; 
make a fresh surface by cutting off the scraped part with a thin, 
sharp knife; proceed in this way until all the meat is reduced 
to a pulp. If necessary, it may be eaten raw, spread very thin 
on slices of toast, or the pulp may be put in a hot fryingpan 
with a little butter and allowed to barely cook through, stirring 
and turning constantly. A weak stomach will often retain 
scraped beef when it refuses all other solid foods. 

Mes. H. A. Floyd. 
Steak on Toast.

butter, pepper and salt. Put in stove and bake till meat is

on a hot griddle with little butter just half done, then cut in 
convenient pieces and put in lemon squeezer and press out the 
juice in tea cup, having the cup warm; season with a little salt 
and pepper. A good and mild stimulant for the sick.

Buttermilk. 

Buttermilk when sweet and fresh from the churn is nutritious 
and wholesome. There are many forms of dyspepsia in which 
it "will set on the stomach" when hardly anything else will. 
In cases of fever it sometimes becomes a question how to nour- 
ish the patient. In such cases buttermilk is sometimes found 
to be the best food that can be given.

Home Made Mustard. 

Some one wished a recipe for prepared mustard. Here is a 
French mustard we have used for 15 years: 

Break 1 egg into an agate dish which may be set on the fire, 
beat egg light. Pour enough ground mustard into a tea cup to 
half fill it. Stir into this 2 slightly rounded tablespoonfuls of 
granulated sugar and pinch of salt. Fill cup up with vinegar, 
mix until free from lumps; pour on the beaten egg and set on 
the fire. Stir constantly until it thickens, 3 or 4 minutes will 
do. When cooked add a lump of butter size of small walnut 
or teaspoonful of olive oil. Very Busy.

If circumstances are such that it is difficult to obtain ice, you 
may still keep your butter sweet and firm, even though you are 
without a cellar. If the butter is not too soft, roll in a napkin 
and immerse it in flour. The result will be all that could be 
desired. If the butter is melted, put it in a bucket, place on 
the lid and set in the flour, always being careful to keep it 
entirely covered with the flour. This is a method practiced by 
cowboys on the ranches, remote from centers of civilization, 
where ice cannot be had at any price.

Ex-Governor Hogg, of Texas, when consulted on 
his death-bed as to the kind of monument he wished 
when he should die, said: 

'•I want no monument of stone, but let my children plant at the 
head of my grave a Pecan tree, and at the foot of my grave a Walnut 
tree, and when these trees shall bear fruit, let the Pecans and Walnute 
be given out among the plain people of Texas, so they may plant them 
and make Texas a land of trees."
