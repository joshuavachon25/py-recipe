- Q/IVITION. - 

The Engravings in this book, as well as the printed matter, being 

fully protected by copyright, we desire to caution all persons 

against copying or reproducing in any form. Any 

one so offending will be prosecuted. 




Much money has been squandered in misdirected 
efforts of well-meaning, painstaking housewives to supply 
their tables with palatable necessaries as well as luxuries 
of life; in vast numbers of instances, health has been im- 
paired and the comfort and happiness of families marred 
by the ignorance of those who have the supervision of the 
culinary department. Quite a large number of books 
have been written and published with the commendable 
design of correcting this fault; some of these have been 
carefully prepared by competent writers, and have been 
excellent so far as they went, and yet they have not been 
80 complete and perfect as to render improvement difficult 
or impracticable. 

Those who examine this New Cook-Book cannot but 
acknowledge that we have no call to apologize for of- 
fering it to the public and expecting a large sale. Its 
intrinsic merits and superiority will readily be seen by 
those who critically analyze the recipes, and will cer- 
tainly be proved by putting them to practical test. The 
recipes are from the pen of a lady whose experience and 
skill as a housekeeper would have justified us in pub- 
lishing them without question, but to insure perfect 
reliability we have had them severally tested by compe- 



IV PKEFACE. 

tent housewives and successful cooks. But in addition 
to their reliability, we claim for these recipes that they 
are written in plain English, concisely yet clearly, so that 
none can mistake their meaning. In many cases, while 
giving the more elaborate and expensive mode of making 
certain articles, we have added cheaper and scarcely 
inferior methods. 

One fact will impress those who use this book : it is 
that we have studied the interests of the user by giving the 
modes of making the most tempting luxuries, as well as 
the commoner necessaries, with the least possible outlay ; 
in other words, our study has been to giv^ the most 
economical as well as best methods of preparing the 
various viands. 

Hoping that our efforts and care may tend to lighten 
the labors and anxieties of the painstaking housewives 
throughout our land, and be appreciated by them, and 
also by those whose tables are in consequence better and 
more economically supplied than before, 

Respectfully, 

The Publishers.

GENERAL REMARKS. 

Good meat is essential to good soup. It should 
be well boiled by the long and slow process, that 
the essence of the meat may be drawn out tho- 
roughly, and the liquor should be carefully 
skimmed to prevent it from becoming turbid. 
When no more scum accumulates, and the meat 
is softened so as to readily separate with the use 
of the fork, the vegetables should be put in, the 
seasoning done, and the necessary amount of hot 
water added if too much has boiled away. A 
common camp-kettle will be found an excellent 
utensil for making soups, as the lid is heavy and 
will keep the steam in. An earthen pipkin or 
jar, if of a long and narrow make, widening a

little at the centre, is perhaps one of the best ves- 
sels for soups, and is universally used by foreign 
cooks, who insist that "it renders the gravy 
clearer and more limpid, and extracts more savor 
from the meat, than when made in tin or cop- 
per." The glutinous matters contained in the 
bones render it important that they should be 
boiled with the meat, as they add to the strength 
and thickness of the soup, although the meat 
should be cut off the bone and divided into small 
pieces, removing the fat. The following thick- 
ening is indispensable to all rich soups : A table- 
spoonful or more of flour, mixed to a smooth 
paste, with a little water and enriched with a 
teaspoonful of good butter or beef dripping ; it 
should be well stirred in. If making a rich 
soup that requires catsup or wine, let it be added 
immediately before the soup is taken from the 
fire. Soup may be colored yellow with grated 
carrots; red with tomato juice; green with the 
juice of powdered spinach, and brown with care- 
fully scorched flour kept ready for the purpose. 
The use of any of these is undoubtedly some im- 
provement, both as to look and flavor. The soupa 
contained in the following j^ages have been tho- 
roughly tested, and their merits contrasted with 



.nl' "'?%. 




GOOD-MORNING! 



SOUPS. 27 

numerous others of a similar character. They 
were found to be more palatable, nutritious, easily 
made and superior as a whole; they but need 
good ingredients. 

FARMER'S AND PLANTER'S SOUP. 

This soup can be made from trimmings of beef 
01 other meats. Put the bones, skin and all the 
rough residue of any joint into a saucepan, with 
a quart and a half pint of cold water, one large 
carrot cut and scraped, two large onions sliced 
and fried brown in one ounce of butter, and one 
very small head of celery washed and cut up. 
Let it stew two hours ; take two potatoes peeled 
and sliced, a salt-spoonful of salt, a half salt- 
spoonful of black pepper, and a half salt-spoon- 
ful of mixed mustard. Let it simmer slowly 
three-quarters of an hour longer. Remove the 
bones and strain all through a sieve. 

BEEP SOUP. 

Selecting a small shin of beef of moderate 
size, crack the bone, then remove the tough out- 
side skin, wash, and place it in a kettle to boil 
with six or eight quarts of water and two table- 



28 MEs. poetee's new cook-book. 

spoousful of salt. Let it boil about four hours, 
until it becomes perfectly tender, then take it out 
of the liquid. If necessary, add more salt to the 
liquid; then two onions cut in small pieces, eight 
turnips cut in quarters, one carrot sliced small, one 
large tablespoonful of sugar, a little sweet mar- 
joram and thyme rubbed fine, and one red pepper 
cut in very small pieces. Thicken this moderately 
with flour and water made into the consistency of 
thick ci'eam, and stir in while boiling. Care must 
be taken not to make the soup too thick with this 
mixture. About three-quarters of an hour before 
the soup is served put in eight potatoes cut into 
quarters. Then make some very small dumplings 
with a quarter of a pound of flour, two ounces of 
butter, a little salt, and sufiicient water to make 
a dough. These dumplings require about ten 
minutes to boil. When put into the soup, they 
must not be much larger than a nutmeg. When 
all are done, just before going to table, add some 
parsley chopped very fine. If noodles should be 
preferred to dumplings, take a quarter of a pound 
of flour, a little salt and as many yolks of eggs as 
will make it into a stiff dough. Roll it out very 
thin, flour it well, and let it remain on the pie- 
board to dry ; then roll it up as yon would a sheet 



SOUPS. 29 

of paper, and cut witli a sharp knife into slips as 
thin as straws ; after all are cut, mix them lightly 
together, and to prevent them from adhering keep 
them well floured. 

A very nice relish for either breakfast or tea 
oan be made as follows: Before adding the vege- 
tables, remove the meat (either beef or veal) from 
the kettle, and, mincing tolerably fine, put it into 
a stew-pan with a piece of butter; season with salt 
black or cayenne pepper, mixed with vinegar, to 
taste ; set over a slow fire, stir well together, and 
send to the table hot. 



CHICKEN SOUP. 

Cut up the fowl, cutting each joint, and wash 
the parts ; boil one hour, then stir in thickening, 
pepper, salt and parsley enough to season ; put in 
a few dumplings, made of half a pound of flour 
mixed with a quarter of a pound of butter; divide 
this dough into equal portions, and roll them in 
your hands into little balls the size of a nutmeg; 
let it then boil a quarter of an hour, or until the 
flesh of the fowl becomes loose on the bones ; the 
yolk of three or four eggs, stirred in, will add 
richness to the taste; boil ten minutes longer, and 

3* 



30 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

then take it up; remove the flesh from the bones 
of the fowl, and divide into pieces of a size to suit, 
mincing the livers and gizzards; place the part;? 
of the fowl in a tureen, pour in the soup a]) 1 
eerve. 

SOUTHERN GUMBO SOUP. 

Cut up one chicken, and fry it to a light 
brown, also two slices of bacon ; pour on them 
three quarts of boiling water; add one onion and 
some sweet herbs tied in a bag; simmer them 
gently three hours and a half; strain off the 
liquor, take off the fat, and then put the ham 
and chicken (cut into small pieces) into the 
liquor; add half a teacup of okra, also half a 
teacup of rice. Boil all half an hour, and just 
before serving add a glass of wine and a dozen 
oysters with their juice. 

LAMB SOUP. 

Put into a stew-pan the leg or neck and breast 
of lamb after washing; add water (according to 
the quantity of soup you wish to make), a large 
teacupful of rice, six or eight turnips pared, 
washed and cut into small pieces, two onions cut 



sotips. 31 

fine, a little sweet marjoram, salt, black and red 
pepper. Boil over a slow fire about one hour; 
then add six or eight white potatoes, cutting 
them into quarters and washing them ; put in 
a tablespoonful of white sugar, and when nearly 
done add a little parsley minced fine ; place the 
meat on a dish, garnish with parsley, put the 
soup in a tureen and serve hot. 

VEGETABLE SOUP. 
Take two quarts of yellow split peas, or two 
quarts of dried white beans ; soak them in cold 
water all night, and drain them in the morning ; 
add a small quantity of salt and pepper, with a 
head of celery cut fine, and place them in a soup-pot 
with four quarts of water, and boil them slowly 
till they are all dissolved ; stir them frequently. 
Have ready a large quantity of fresh vegetables 
such as turnips, carrots, parsnips, potatoes, onions, 
cauliflowers and asparagus tops. The vegetables 
requiring the longest boiling should be put in first 
cutting them all into small pieces ; the addition 
of some bits of fresh butter rolled in flour will 
give richness and flavor to the soup. When the 
vegetables are boiled quite tender put the soup 
Into a tureen and serve up hot. 



32 MEs. poetee's new cook-book. 

PEA SOUP. 

Take a quart of split peas, wash them, and put 
them into the soup-kettle with two quarts of cold 
water. Boil one hour, then add a piece of lean 
salt pork, about three-quarters of a pound, and 
boil two hours longer. When nearly done, add a 
few thin slices of ham, a few split crackers and 
some pepper and salt. Stir the soup frequently 
while boiling to prevent its burning. Should 
it become thicker than is desirable, pour on boil- 
ing water and stir. Put the soup into a tureen 
and serve hot. A more simple method is to 
take the liquor in which a joint of beef has been 
boiled, and, after skimming it well, put in the peas, 
which have been soaked and boiled. Flavor witJi 
a little mushroom sauce. 

BEAN SOUP. 
Put into a kettle, containing three quarts oi 
water, three pints of dried white beans ; let them 
simmer, and when they begin to shrink drain 
them in a colander; put them again into the 
kettle with three quarts of boiling water, then 
add two pounds of pickled pork after washing; 
cook slowly, and if necessary add a little salt 
and pepper, and send to the table hot. 



BOUP8. 33 

CORN SOUP. 

Put into a soup-pot, with some bits of boiled 
ham, a knuckle of veal and a set of calf's feet, 
adding a little pepper, allowing a quart of water 
to each pound of meat; let it boil until the meat 
is ready to fall from the bone; strain and pour 
the liquid into a clean pot. If you have plenty 
of milk at hand, use no water. Take a tough fowl, 
and, cutting it into pieces, let it boil with the veal 
and feet. When the soup is well boiled and the 
shreds all strained away, have ready some young 
and tender ears of sweet corn, which have been 
cooked by themselves in another pot; cut the 
grains from the cob, mix the corn with fresh 
butter, season with pepper, and stir it in the 
strained soup ; boil a little longer, and serve. 

PEPPER-POT. 

Cut into small strips about a half pound of 
good white tripe which has been thoroughly 
boiled and skimmed in a pot by itself; boil in 
another pot a neck of mutton and a pound of 
lean ham, with a gallon of water; boil slowly, 
and when skimmed sufficiently, add two large 
onions sliced, four potatoes quartered and four 



34 MRS. portee's new cook-book. 

sliced turnips; season with a very small piece 
of red pepper, taking care not to make it too 
hot; tlien add the boiled tripe. Make a quart 
bowlful of small dumplings of butter and flour 
mixed with a very little water, put them into the 
pepper-pot and boil about three-quarters of an 
hour; take out the meat, letting the tripe remain, 
ind pour the soup into a tureen. 

CURRY SOUP. 

Season two quarts of strong veal broth with 
two onions, a bunch of parsley, salt and pepper ; 
strain it, and have ready a chicken cut in joints 
and skinned; put it in the broth with a table- 
spoonful of curry powder ; boil the chicken till 
quite tender. A little before serving add the 
juice of a lemon and a teacupful of boiling cream. 
Serve boiled rice to eat with this soup. Always 
boil cream before putting it in soup or gravy. (A 
recipe for making Curry Powder will be found 
under the head of Sauces.) 

MACARONI SOUP. 

Take a quart of gravy soup, break two ounces 
of Naples macaroni into pieces of little more than 



SOUPS. 35 

an inch long, putting them, by degrees, into a 
small portion of the boiling soup, to prevent them 
from sticking together, and let them boil until 
quite tender, but not soft or pulpy — from fifteen 
to twenty minutes if quite fresh, but nearly half 
an hour if at all stale. Vermicelli is used in the 
same manner. Either will improve the consistency 
of the soup if the quantity above stated be added ; 
but it is useless and does not look well to see, as 
at some tables, only a few strings of it floating in 
the tureen. 

PORTABLE SOUP. 

Put on, in four gallons of water, ten pounds of 
a shin of beef, free from fat and skin, six pounds 
of a knuckle of veal, and two fowls ; break the 
bones and cut the meat into small pieces ; season 
with one ounce of whole black pepper, quarter 
of an ounce of Jamaica pepper, and the same of 
mace; cover the pot very closely, and let it simmer 
twelve or fourteen hours, and then strain it. The 
following day take off the fat and clear the jelly 
from any sediment adhering to it ; boil it gently 
upon a stove without covering the sauce-pan, 
and stir it frequently till it thickens to a strong 
glue. Pour it into broad tin pans, and put ir 



36 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

a cool oven. When it will take the impres- 
sion of a knife, score it in equal squares. Stand 
it in a south window or near a stove. When dry, 
Ijreak it at the scores. Wrap it in paper, and put 
it closely up in boxes. There should always be a 
large supply of this soup, as with it and catsup no 
one will ever be at a loss for dressed dishes and 
soups. 

HAEE OR RABBIT SOUP. 

Cut up two hares, put them into a pot with a 
piece of bacon, two onions chopped fine, a bundle 
of thyme and parsley, which must be taken out of 
the soup before it is thickened; add pepper, salt, 
pounded cloves and mace; put in a sufficient quan- 
tity of water, stew it gently three hours, thicken 
with a large spoonful of butter, brown flour or glass 
of red wine; boil a few minutes longer, and serve 
with the nicest parts of the hare. 

Squirrels make equally as good soup, prepared 
in the same way. 

FRENCH SOUP. 

Take the nicest part of a thick brisket of 
beef, about eight pounds; put it in a pot witli 



SOUPS. 



37 



everything directed for other soup; make it 
exactly in the same way, only put it on an hour 
sooner, that you may have time to prepare the 
bouilli {i. e., the beef which has been boiled in 
the soup). After it boils five hours, take out the 
beef, cover up the soup, set it near the fire to keep 
hot. Take the skin off; have the yolk of an egg 
well beaten, dip a feather in it and wash the top 
of your beef; sprinkle over it the crumbs of stale 
bread grated, put it in an oven previourjly heated, 
put the top on with coals enough to brown it, let 
it stand nearly an hour, and prepare your gravy 
thus: Take suflacient quantity of soup and vege- 
tables boiled in it, add a tablespoonful of red wine 
and two of mushroom catsup, thicken with a little 
butter and brown flour ; make it very hot, pour it 
in your dish, and put the beef on it; garnish with 
green pickle cut in thin slices, serve up the soup 
in a tureen with bits of toasted bread. 



TURTLE SOUP. 

Kill the turtle at night in winter, and in the 
morning in summer. Hang it up by the hind fins, 
cut off the head and let it bleed well. In dress- 
ing, separate the bottom shell from the top 



38 MKS. POETER^S NEW COOK-BOOK. 

with great care, lest the gall-bladder be broken. 
Put the liver in a bowl of water; empty the 
entrails and lay them in water ; if there be eggs, 
lay them in water also. It is proper to have a 
different bowl of water for each. Cut the flesh 
from the bottom shell and lay it in water ; then 
break the shell in two, put it in a pot, having 
washed it clean; pour on water enough to cover 
it ; add one pound of middling, with four onions 
chopped, and set it on the fire to boil ; let it boil 
steadily three hours ; if the water boils away too 
much, add more. Wash the top shell nicely after 
taking out the flesh, cover it and set it by. Par- 
boil the fins, clean them nicely, taking off all the 
black skin ; put them in water ; cut the flesh taken 
from the bottom and top shell in small pieces ; 
cut the fins in two, lay them with the flesh in a 
dish, s]3rinkle salt over, and cover them up. 
When the shell, etc., is done, take out the bacon, 
scrape the shell clean and strain the liquor, 
one-third of which put back in the pot, reserve 
the rest for the soup ; take out all the nice bits, 
strain, and put them in the gravy; lay the fins, 
cut in small pieces, in with them, and as much of 
the flesh as will be sufficient to fill the upper 
shell; add to it (if a large turtle) one bottle of 



SOUPS. * 39 

wine, cayenne pepper and salt to your taste, one 
gill of mushroom catsup, one gill of lemon pickle, 
mace, nutmegs and cloves pounded, to season 
high. Mix two large spoonfuls of flour in one 
pound and a quarter of butter, put it in witli 
thyme, parsley, marjoram and savory, tied in 
bunches; stew all these together till the flesh 
and fins are tender ; wash out the top shell ; put 
a puff-paste around the brim; sprinkle the shell 
over with pepper and salt; then take the herbs 
out of the stew. If the gravy is not thick 
enough, add more flour and fill the shell. If 
there are no eggs in the turtle, boil six new-laid 
eggs for ten minutes, put them in cold water a 
few minutes, peel and slice them and place them 
on the turtle; make a rich forcemeat, fry the balls 
nicely, and put them also in the shell; set it in a 
dripping-pan, with something under the sides to 
keep it steady; have the oven heated as for bread, 
and let it remain till nicely browned. Fry the 
liver and send it in hot. 

To prepare the soup, commence early in the 
morning; put on eight pounds of coarse beef, some 
bacon, onions, sweet herbs, pepper and salt

left from boiling the bottom shell; season very 
high with wine, catsup, spice and cayenne; put in 
the flesh you reserved, and if it is not enough, add 
the nicest parts of a well-boiled calf's head, but 
do not use the eyes or tongue; let it boil till 
tender, and serve it up with fried forcemeat balls 
in it. If you have curry powder (see receipt for 
it in remarks for Sauces), it will give a higher 
flavor to both soup and turtle than spice.

Scald a calf's head, and wash it clean; boil it 
in a large pot of water for half an hour, then cut 
all the skin ofl" by itself; take the tongue out ; 
take the broth made of a knuckle of veal, put in 
the tongue and skin, with one onion, half ounce 
of cloves, and half ounce of mace, half a nutmeg, 
all kinds of sweet herbs chopped fine, and three 
anchovies ; stew it till tender ; then take out the 
meat, and cut it in pieces two inches square ; cut 
the tongue, previously skinned, in slices, strain 
the liquoi through a sieve, melt half a pound 
of butter in a stew-pan, put in it half a pound 
of flour; stir it till smooth — if at all lumpy 
strain it; add the liquor, stirring it all the time; 



SOUPS. 41 

then put to the meat the juice of two lemons, and 
one bottle of madeira wine if you choose; season 
with pepper, salt and cayenne pepper pretty high ; 
put in five meat-balls, eight eggs boiled hard. Stew 
it gently one hour, serve in a tureen ; if too thick, 
add more liquor before stewing last time. 

LOBSTER SOUP. 

To boil a lobster put it in a fish-kettle and 
cover it with cold water, cooking it on a quick 
fire. Remove the small bladder found near the 
head, and take out a small vein found immediately 
under the shell all along the back of the lobster, 
and use the rest. Two lobsters will make soup for 
six or eight persons, and salad also. All the under 
shell and small claws are pounded in a mortar 
to make the soup; when pounded, put it into 
a pan and set it on the fire with broth or water. 
The meat is cut in small pieces, to be added after- 
ward. The soup is left on the fire to boil gently 
for half an hour; then pour it in a sieve and 
press it with a masher to extract the juice. To 
make it thicker, a small piece of parsnip can be 
added and mashed with the rest into a pan, so 
that all the essence is extracted in that way from 



42 MKS. porter's new cook-book. 

the lobster. When you have strained it, put a 
little butter with it, and add as much broth as is 
required. Put some of the meat in the tureen and 
pour the soup over it. 

CRAB SOUP. 

Boil in threie quarts of milk the meat of two 
dozen crabs cut in bits ; add a little cayenne, nut- 
meg and powdered mace; thicken with butter 
mixed in flour; just before taking it from the 
fire, crumble into the soup half a dozen yolks 
of hard boiled eggs, and after pouring into the 
tureen strew over the surface the heart of a fresh 
green lettuce cut small. 

OYSTER SOUP. 

Put two quarts of oysters, liquor and all, in a 
pan, taking care to remove any particles of shell 
that may adhere to the oysters; set them on a 
stove to heat, but don't let them boil or come 
very near to it. Drain all the liquor into your 
soup-kettle, and put in a pint of water and two 
quarts of new milk, half a pound of butter, a 
little whole allspice, -pepper and a few blades 
of mace. When, it boils, break up some crackers 



SOUPS. 43 

niie and put into the soup. Then add the oysters, 
which have been kept warm. Oysters should 
riever be allowed to boil, as it makes them tough 
and shrinks them up; they should be scalded 
only. Salt should be the last thing to add in 
any soup where milk is used, which it is apt to 
curdle. Serve up hot. 



OLAM SOUP. 

Having put your clams into a pot of boiling 
water to make them open easily, take them from the 
shells, carefully saving the liquor. To the liquor 
of a quart of opened clams allow three quarts of 
water. Mix the water with the liquor of the 
clams, and put it into a large pot with a knuckle 
of veal, the bone of which should be chopped in 
four places. When it has simmered four hours, 
put in a large bunch of sweet herbs, a beaten 
nutmeg, a teaspoonful of mace and a tablespoon- 
ful of whole pepper, but no salt, as that of the 
liquor will be sufficient. Stew slowly an hour 
longer, then strain it. When you have returned 
the liquor to the pot, add a quarter of a pound 
of butter divided in four, and each bit rolled in 
flour. Then put in the clams (having cut them 



44 MEs. porter's new cook-book. 

in pieces), and let it boil fifteen minutes. Send 
to table with toasted bread cut in dice. This 
soup will be greatly improved by the addition of 
small forcemeat balls. Make them of cold veal 
or chicken, mixed with equal quantities of chop- 
ped suet and sweet marjoram, and a smaller pro- 
portion of hard-boiled egg, grated lemon peel and 
powdered nutmeg. Pound all the ingredients 
together in a mortar, adding a little pepper and 
salt. Break in a raw egg or two (in proportion 
to the quantity), to bind the whole together and 
prevent it from crumbling to pieces. When 
thoroughly mixed, make the forcemeat into small 
balls, and let them boil ten minutes in the soup, 
shortly before you send it to the table. If you 
are obliged to make them of raw veal or raw 
chicken, they must boil longer. It will be a 
great improvement to cut up a yam and boil in 
the soup. Oyster soup may also be made in this 
manner. 





GENERAL REMARKS. 

Fish are dressed in a variety of ways, accoid- 
ing to taste. They are boiled, broiled, baked, 
stewed and fried, but the most common methods 
are broiling and frying — broiling when required 
to be done in a plain way, and frying when a 
high relish or flavor is to be given. In all modes 
of preparing fish for the table much care is re- 
quired to prevent them from being broken or dis- 
figured. In determining the signs of freshness 
and good condition the utmost caution must also 
be exercised. In a wholesome state the eye of 
the fish will appear bright, the gills of a fine, 
clear red, the body stiff, the flesh firm and the 
odor not unpleasant. They should be well 
cleaned, scraped and rinsed, care being taken 
not to let them soak longer than necessary, as 
fish, like meat, lose flavor by remaining too 
long in the water. In opening and removing 
the entrails of the fish, be very careful not to 



4i 



46 MEs. porter's new cook-book. 

allow the smallest particle of offensive matter 
to remain inside. Wash out the blood, scrap- 
ing it carefully from the back-bone. A fish 
can be dressed without splitting it entirely down 
from head to tail. Smelts and other small fish 
are drawn or emptied at the gills. It is very 
desirable to have boiled fish served with the 
flesh as firm as possible; this can be accomplished 
by putting a small piece of saltpetre with the salt 
into the water in which it is boiled : a quarter of 
an ounce is enough for a gallon. Fish should 
never be left in the water after they are done, but 
taken up and laid upon a sieve to drain. Salt 
fish must always be well soaked in plenty of cold 
water for a night, or until the flesh is well 
softened. 



FRIED HALIBUT. 

Select a choice piece of this large and delicate- 
looking fish, and, after carefully washing and dry- 
ing with a soft towel, cut it into thick fillets, re- 
move the bone with a sharp knife, cut the fillets 
into slices, place them upon a suitable dish and take 
off the skin. Season with a little salt and pepper, 
and place upon each slice a piece of good butter. 



FISH. 47 

Dip the slices into a pan of beaten yolk of egg 
seasoned with grated nutmeg and powdered mace 
(already prepared) ; having ready another pan of 
grated bread-crumbs, dip the slices into it also, 
then place them in a hot frying-pan of boiling 
lard. When one side becomes fried sufficiently, 
turn the slices, and when all are done remove 
them from the frying-pan and drain. Send to 
the table hot. 



BOILED HALIBUT. 

Take a piece of the fish weighing from fcur to 
six pounds ; score the back deeply, and lay it on 
the strainer in your kettle, with the back under- 
most. Cover it with cold water and throw in a 
handful of salt. Do not let it come to boil too 
fast. Skin carefully when the fish becomes hard ; 
hang the kettle higher or diminish the fire under 
it, so as to let the liquor simmer twenty-five or 
thirty minutes. Strain it, and send the fish to 
the table garnished with grated horseradish in 
alternate heaps, and curled parsley, accompanied 
with a boat of egg sauce. 

What is left of the halibut prepare for the 
supper-table by mincing it when cold, and season- 



48 MES. porter's new cook-book. 

ing it with a dressing of salt, cayenne, sweet 
oil, hard-boiled eggs and a large proportion of 
vine2;ar. 

HALIBUT OUTLETS. 

Cut your halibut steaks an inch thick, wipe 
them with a dry cloth, and season with salt and 
cayenne. Have ready a pan of yolk of eggs well 
beaten and a dish of grated bread-crumbs. Put 
some fresh lard or beef drippings in a frying- 
pan, and hold it over the fire till it boils. Dip 
your cutlets in the egg, and then in the bread- 
crumbs. Fry a light brown, serve up hot, with 
the gravy in the bottom of the dish. Salmon 
or any large fish may be fried in the same 
manner. 

BOILED SHAD. 

Scrape, sj)lit, wash and dry the shad on a 
cloth ; season with pepper and salt ; grease the 
gridiron well; as soon as it is hot, lay the shad 
on to broil. One side being well browned, turn 
it. It should broil a quarter of an hour or more, 
according to thickness. Butter well, and send to 
table hot. 



FISH. 49 

The roes of the shad are relished by many per- 
sons as a great nicety. They should be careful- 
ly washed, and then parboiled in salted water. 
Season with salt and cayenne pepper, dredge 
with flour and fry in fresh lard. When they 
are nicely browned on both sides, dish, and send 
to table hot. 

BAKED SHAD. 

Many people are of the opinion that the very 
best method of cooking a shad is to bake it. 
Stuff it with bread-crumbs, salt, pepper, butter 
and parsley, and mix this up with beaten yolk 
of egg; fill the fish with it, and sew it up or 
fasten a string around it. Pour over it a little 
water and some butter, and bake as you would 
a fowl. A shad will require from an hour to an 
hour and a quarter to bake. 

PLANKED SHAD. 

Peocure at a house-furnishing store a shad- 
board of oak. It is better to purchase one ready 
made, the cost being only about seventy-five cents. 
These boards are very strong and smooth, and 
furnished with thick wires crossing the board 



50 MES. poeter's new cook-book. 

diagonally. These secure the fish without nail- 
ing. The plank should be well seasoned. Cut 
oft' the head and tail of the finest shad you can 
get, split it down the back, and, after a good 
washing, wipe it dry. Scatter upon it some salt 
and pepper. Having placed the plank before 
the fire until it has become very hot and ready 
to char, place the shad (spread open) within the 
wires crossing the hot board, with the back next 
to the plank, the head downward. Roast, and in 
a little while turn the other end of the board, 
placing the tail downward. That the juice of the 
fish may be well absorbed, turn the board fre- 
quently up and dov»rn. When sufficiently roasted, 
add some fresh butter, and send to the table on 
the board, under which place a large tray or dish. 
Shad cooked in this way are greatly relished by 
parties, who in the shad-season frequently repair 
to the banks of our rivers where there are shad- 
fisher?es, and purchase of the fishermen the shad 
fresh from the wateii 



PICKLED SHAD. 

Divide fine fresh shad into halves, fry them 
a nice brown, and set them away till cold, 



FISH. 51 

having, of course, salted and peppered them 
properly. Make a pickle of a quart of good 
vinegar, a blade of mace, the rind of a lemon, 
a few pepper-corns and a pepper; simmer all 
together, then pour it over the shad hot, cover 
down close, and stand for a day or more before 
using. 

POTTED SALMON. 

Skin the salmon, and clean it thoroughly by 
wiping with a cloth (water would spoil it) ; cut it 
into small pieces, which rub with salt; let them re- 
main till thoroughly drained; then lay them in a 
dish, and season with powdered mace, cloves and 
pepper to taste. Add a quarter of a pound of 
butter, and bake ; when quite done drain them 
from the gravy, press into pots for use, and when 
cold pour over them clarified butter. 



DRIED SALMON. 

Cut the salmon into layers ; have ready some 
eggs boiled hard and chopped; put both into 
half a pint of thin cream, and two or three 
ounces of butter rubbed with a teaspoonful of 
flour ; skim it, and stir till boiling hot ; make a 



52 MRS. POUTER'S NEW COOK-BOOK. 

wall of mashed potatoes round the inner edge of 
a dish, and pour the above in it. 



BOILED SHEEPSHBAD OR TURBOT. 

As much of the excellence of this most delicate 
Ahd delicious fish depends upon the manner in 
which it is dressed, great care should be taken to 
properly prepare it. After having thoroughly 
cleaned and washed the fish, soak it an hour or 
two in salt and water to draw off the slime ; let 
it remain three-quarters of an hour in cold water, 
after which drain and wipe it dry ; then score the 
back deeply with a knife. By rubbing the fish 
over with a cut lemon its color will be greatly 
improved. The fish-kettle should be large and 
very clean. Lay the fish on the strainer of the 
kettle, with its back downward ; cover well with 
equal proportions of milk and water, adding a 
small spoonful of salt. Do not let it come to a 
boil too fast, and skim carefully; when the scum 
has ceased to rise, diminish the heat under the 
kettle, and let it simmer for about half an hour 
or more, not allowing it to boil hard. When the 
fish is done, take it up carefully with a fish-slice, 
and pour over it a sauce prepared in the f(>llow- 



FISH. 63 

ing manner: Mix together very smoothly with 
a broad-bladed knife a quarter of a pound of 
fresh butter and two tablespoonfuls of flour ; put 
them into a clean sauce-pan and hold it over the 
fire, and stir them till melted. Then add a large 
salt-spoonful of powdered mace, and as much 
cayenne as will lay on a sixpence. It will be 
much improved by the addition of some boiled 
lobster, chopped small. When the sauce has 
simmered five minutes, add very gradually half 
a pint of rich cream, and let it come almost to a 
boil, stirring all the time. The hot sauce may 
either be poured over the fish, or it may be sent 
to the table in a sauce-boat; in which case you 
may ornament the fish with the coral of the 
lobster, put on in a handsome figure. 

STURGEON STEAKS. 

Remove the skin ; cut from the tailpiece slices 
half an inch thick ; rub them well with salt, and 
broil them over a clear fire of bright coals. Butter, 
sprinkle with cayenne pepper, and send them to 
the table hot, garnished with slices of lemon. 

Another way is to make a seasoning of bread- 
crumbs, sweet herbs, pepper and salt. First dip 

5* 



54 MEs. porter's new cook-book. 

the slices of sturgeon in a beaten yolk of egg^ 
then cover them with seasoning; wrap them up 
closely in sheets of white paper well buttered, and 
broil them over a clear fire. Send thiem to the 
table either with or without the paper. 

BOILED EOCKFISH. 

After the fish has been nicely cleaned, put it 
into a pot with water enough to cover it, and 
throw in salt in the proportion of half a tea- 
spoonful to a pound of fish. Boil it slowly until 
the meat is tender and easily separates from the 
bones. A large fish will require an hour to cook. 
When done, serve on a hot dish, and have a few 
hard-boiled eggs, cut in thin slices, laid around it 
and over it. Have egg-sauce in a boat to eat 
with it. 

FISH CHOWDER. 

The best fish for chowder are haddock and 
striped bass. Cut the fish in pieces about one 
inch thick and two inches long. Cut five or 
six good slices of the best salt pork, lay them 
in the bottom of an iron pot and fry till crisp; 
take out the pork, leaving the fat; chop the pork 



FISH. 55 

fine; put into the pot a layer of fish, a layer of 
split crackers and some of the chopped pork, a 
little red and black pepper, a little chopped onion, 
then another layer of fish, split crackers and 
seasoning, and so on till all the fish is used. 
Then just cover all with water, and stew slowly 
till all is tender. Thicken the gravy with 
cracker-crumbs and catsup if you like ; take out 
the fish, boil up the gravy once, squeeze in the 
juice of a lemon, and pour the gravy over the 
fish. Add salt if necessary. 

PRIED PERCH. 

When the fish are scaled and thoroughly 
cleaned, brush them over with egg and cover 
with bread-crumbs. Have ready some boiling 
lard, put the fish in, and fry a nice brown. 
Serve with melted butter or anchovy sauce. 

PRIED SMELTS. 

They should not be washed more than is 
necessary to clean them. Dry them in a cloth ; 
then lightly flour them, but shake it off. Dip 
them into plenty of egg, then into bread-crumbs 
grated fine, and plunge them into a good pan of 



5Q MRS. pokter's new cook-book. 

boiling lard; let them continue gently boiling, 
and a few minutes will make them a bright 
yellow-brown. Take care not to remove the 
light roughness of the crumbs, or their beauty 
will be lost. 

PRIED CATFISH. 

Catfish must be cooked quite fresh — ^if pos- 
sible, directly out of the water. The larger ones 
are generally coarse and strong; the small-sized 
fish are the best. Wash and clean them, cut off 
their heads and tails, remove the upper part of 
the back-bone near the shoulders, and score them 
along the back with deep gashes or incisions. 
Dredge them with flour, and fry them in plenty 
of lard, boiling fast when the catfish are put 
into the pan. Or you may fry them in the 
drippings or gravy saved from roast beef or veal. 
They are very nice dipped in a batter of beaten 
egg and grated bread-crumbs, or they may be 
done plain, though not in so nice a way, with 
Indian meal instead of bread-crumbs. Drain off 
the lard before you dish them. Touch each in- 
cision or cut very slightly with a little cayenne 
before they go to table. Catfish are equally a 
breakfast or a supper dish. 



FISH. 57 

FRIED EBLS. 

After skinning, emptying and ^vasliing them 
as clean as possible, cut them into short ])ieces, 
and dry them well with a soft cloth; season them 
with fine salt and cayenne, flour them thickly, 
and fry them in boiling lard ; when nicely 
browned, drain and dry them, and send to the 
table with plain melted butter and a lemon, or 
with fish-sauce. Eels are sometimes dipped 
into batter and then fried, or into egg and fried 
bread-crumbs, and served with plenty of crisped 
parsley. 

CODFISH CAKES. 

After washing, the fish must remain in water 
all night to soak; then boil it and remove the 
bones. Chop and work it until entirely fine ; put 
it in a basin with water; add a large piece of 
butter, two eggs, and beat it thoroughly until it 
thickens, without boiling. Have some potatoes 
ready prepared and nicely mashed; work the 
fish and potatoes thoroughly together as above, 
seasoning with cayenne and salt ; make the mix- 
ture into fine cakes, and fry them in lard, a light 
brown on both sides. 



58 MRS. porter's new COOK-BOOK. 

FISH PUDDING. 

Pick any cold fish left from the dinner into fine 
bits, carefully removing all the bones. Thicken 
some boiling milk with flour wet to a batter with 
cold milk, and stir the fish into it; season with pep- 
per, butter and salt. Put it into a pudding-dish, 
and spread cracker or bread-crumbs thickly over 
the top to prevent the milk from scorching, and 
set into the oven to bake just long enough to 
brown nicely. This is a good way to use up 
cold fish, making a nice breakfast dish or side 
dish for dinner. 

SALT FISH WITH PARSNIPS. 

Salt fish must of course always be well soaked 
in cold water at least twelve hours before cooking 
It should then be put on to boil in plenty of cold 
water without any salt, and, when thoroughly 
done, should be well drained free from any water 
and placed on a dish with plenty of well-boiled 
parsnips. A sauce may be poured over the 
fish ; it can be made as follows : Mix two 
ounces of butter with three ounces of flour, 
pepper and salt, a small glassful of vinegar and 
a good half pint of water. Stir this on the fire 



FISH. 59 

till it boils. A few hard-boiled egg^ chopped up 
und mixed in this sauce would add to the excel- 
lence of the dish. 



STEWED TERRAPIN. 

To make a good dish of terrapins it is essential 
that the terrapins be of the very best quality. 
Select the largest, thickest and fattest, the females 
being the best. Put them whole into boiling water, 
add a little salt, and boil them until thoroughly 
done ; after which, take off the shell, extract the 
meat and remove carefully the sand-bag and gall, 
also all the entrails ; they are unfit to eat, and are 
no longer used in cooking terrapins for the best 
tables. Cut the meat into pieces, and put it into 
a stew-pan w^ith its eggs, and sufficient fresh butter 
to stew it well. Let it stew till quite hot through- 
out, keeping the pan carefully covered, that none 
of the flavor may escape, but shake it over the 
fire while stewing. In another pan make a sauce 
of beaten yolk of egg, highly flavored with madeira 
or sherry and powdered nutmeg and mace, and 
enriched with a large lump of fresh butter. Stir 
this sauce well over the fire, and when it has al- 
most come to a boil, take it off. Send the terrapins 



60 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

to the table hot in a covered dish, and the sauce 
separately in a sauce-tureen, to be used by those 
who like it, and omitted by those who prefer the 
genuine flavor of the terrapins when simply stewed 
with butter. This is now the usual mode of dress- 
ing terrapins in Maryland, Virginia and many 
other parts of the South, and will be found 
superior to any other. 

BOILED LOBSTERS. 

If purchased alive, lobsters should be chosen 
bj'' their weight (the heaviest are the best) and 
their liveliness and briskness of motion. When 
freshly boiled they are stiff, and their tails turn 
strongly inward; when the fish appear soft and 
watery, they are stale. The flesh of the male 
lobster is generally considered of the finest flavor 
for eating, but the hen lobster is preferred for 
sauce and soups, on account of the coral. Throw 
the lobsters into a kettle of fast-boiling salt and 
water, that life may be destroyed in an instant. 
Let them boil for about half an hour. When 
done, take them out of the ke1;tle, wipe them 
clean, and rub the shell with a little salad oil, 
which will give a clear red appearance. Crack 




MAKING BUTTER 



FISH. 61 

the large claws without mashiDg them, and with a 
sharp knife split the body and tail from end to 
end. The head, which is never eaten, should also 
be separated from the body, but laid so near it that 
he division is almost imperceptible. Send to 
I able and dress in any way preferred. 

SCOLLOPED CRABS. 

Put the crabs into a kettle of boiling water, and 
throw in a handful of salt. Boil from twenty 
minutes to half an hour. Take them from the 
water when done and pick out all the meat; be 
careful not to break the shell. To a pint of meat 
put a little salt and pepper; taste, and if not 
enough add more, a little at a time, till suited. 
Grate in a very little nutmeg, and add one spoon- 
ful of cracker or bread-crumbs, two eggs well 
beaten, and two tablespoonfuls of butter (even 
full); stir all well together; wash the shells 
clean, and fill each shell full of the mixture; 
sprinkle crumbs over the top and moisten with 
the liquor; set in the oven till of a nice brown; 
a few minutes will do it. Send to the table hot, 
arranged on large dishes. They are eaten at 
breakfast or supper 



62 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

BOILED CRABS. 

After boiling the crabs in salt and water about 
twenty -five minutes, take them out, break off the 
claw^s, wipe the crabs very clean, throw away the 
small claws, but the large ones may be cracked 
and sent to table. Rub a little sweet oil on the 
shells, to make them a fine color. 

STEWED OYSTERS. 

Put as many good fresh oysters, with theii 
liquor, as you think you will need, into a pan on 
the stove to heat, but not to boil. Drain the 
juice off into a saucepan ; as soon as it boils add 
half a pound of butter and some pepper ; when 
this boils add a pint of cream and thicken a little 
with flour; after this boils up once, put in the 
oysters, and more salt if necessary. Serve hot. 

Many persons prefer oysters stewed in water 
instead of cream. Make in all respects the same, 
substituting only the water for the cream. 

PRIED OYSTERS. 

When fried in bread-crumbs oysters are much 
the best. Select the largest and finest fresh 
oysters, and, after freeing them from all the 



FISH. 63 

small particles of shell, put them into a colander 
and pour over a little water to rinse them ; then 
place them on a clean towel and dry them. Have 
ready some grated bread-crumbs, seasoned with 
pepper and salt, and plenty of yolk of egg beaten 
till very light; and to each egg allow a large tea- 
spoonful of rich cream or of the best fresh butter. 
Beat the egg and cream together. Dip each 
oyster fiiot into the egg and cream, and then 
into the crumbs. Repeat this twice, until the 
oysters are well coated all over. Have ready 
boiling, in a frying-pan, an equal mixture of 
fresh butter and lard. It must come nearly to 
the edge or top of the frying-pan, and be boiling 
fast when the oysters go in, otherwise they will 
be heavy and greasy, and sink to the bottom. 
Fry them of a yellow brown on both sides. Send 
them to table hot. 



OYSTER FRITTERS. 

Make a batter of milk, flour, eggs, cream of 
tartar, saleratus, and salt in proper proportion. 
Make no thicker than for pancakes. Drop an 
oyster into each spoon of batter as you dip it out, 
and fry in hot lard ; brown well on both sides. 



64 MES. pokter's new cook-book. 

BROILED OYSTERS. 

Select tlie largest and finest oysters. The 
gridiron, which should be a double one, made 
:f wire, should be well greased with butter; 
and having placed the oysters so that they will 
all receive the heat equally, set them over a 
brisk fire, and broil both sides without burning 
them. Let them be served hot, adding a small 
lump of fresh butter, pepper and salt. 

PANNED OYSTERS. 

Take fifty large oysters; remove every particle 
of shell which may adhere to them, put them into 
a colander and pour over a little water to rinse 
them. After letting them drain, put them into a 
stew-pan with a quarter of a pound of butter, 
salt, black and red pepper to taste. Put them 
over a clear fire, and stir while cooking. As 
soon as they commence to shrink remove them 
from the fire, and send to table hot in a well- 
heated covered dish. 

SCOLLOPED OYSTERS. 

Take baker's bread at least three days old. 
Btraiu your oysters, put a layer of them on the 



FISH. 65 

bottom of your dish, with bits of butter, salt, 
pepper and a very little mace ; spread over them 
a layer of bread-crumbs, and continue till the 
dish 'is full, having bread-crumbs on top. Pour 
in a cup of the liquor of the oysters. Bake one 
hour. Be very careful not to have the layers of 
bread too thick. 



OYSTER PATTIES IN BATTER. 

Make a batter with three eggs, a little nutmeg, 
some powdered mace, a little flour, and a little 
salt; dip in the oysters, and fry them a nice 
brown in boiling lard or butter. Send to the 
Kble hot, garnished with parsley. 



OYSTER PUDDING. 

Take two dozen nice large oysters, drain them

very dry, in your pudding-dish, then a layer of 

oysters, then a layer of rice, and another of oysters,

OYSTER PIE. 

Strain the liquor from the oysters, and put it 
on to boil with butter, pepper and a thickening 
of bread-crumbs and milk well beaten together, 
and after boiling a few minutes throw in the 
oysters. Let them remain five minutes, take them 
off, and when warm add the beaten yolks of three 
eggs. Line a buttered dish with a rich paste, and 
fill with white paper or a clean napkin, to support 
a lid of paste, and bake it. When lightly browned, 
take off the lid, remove the paper or napkin, 
pour in the oysters, set a few minutes in the 
oven and send to table hot. 

PICKLED OYSTERS. 

Take two hundred oysters of the largest size, 
rinse them in their own liquor, put them in a 
stew-pan, strain the liquor to them, and let them 
come to a boil — -just and no more. Take them 
out of the liquor, have ready a quart or more of 
pure cider vinegar, boiled with whole pepper, a 
little salt, mace, cloves and nutmeg. When it is 
cool pour it over the oysters. Before serving 
add a few raw cranberries and thin slices of 
lemon. 



FISH. 67 

FRIED CLAMS. 

Open carefully into a chopping-bowl, saving the 
liquor, but be careful that no gritty particles from 
the shell fall in ; chop coarsely, and sprinkle over 
some pepper. Have ready a mixture of egg and 
grated cracker thickened with a little flour. Take 
up the clams one by one with a spoon, and dip 
them into the mixture. Fry slowly in plenty of 
butter or lard. 

CLAM FRITTERS. 

Take twenty-five clams and chop them fine, 
'leaving out the juice ; four eggs beaten, one cup of 
sour cream (if you have no cream, use one cup of 
buttermilk and a piece of butter the size of an 
ess, melted and well mixed) ; one cup of flour, 
one small spoonful of saleratus. Then fry in 
butter, and spread them well with good sweet 
butter when you take them out of the frying- 
pan. Serve them up hot. 

SCOLLOPED CLAMS. 

Take a sufficient quantity of small sand-clams, 
Trash the shells thoroughly, put them into a pot 
cf boiling water, and when the shells open take 



68 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

out the clams, drain them, chop into small pieces, 
throwing aside the toughest portions. Season 
with black pepper and powdered mace, and mix 
them with grated bread-crumbs and fresh butter. 
Have ready some large and well-cleansed clam- 
shells, and fill them to the edge with the mixture, 
moistening it slightly with the liquor ; cover the 
surface with grated crumbs, and add to each one 
a small bit of butter; place them in an oven and 
bake to a light brown. Send them to the table 
in the shells they were baked in, nicely arranged 
on .suitable dishes. Scolloped clams are eaten at 
breakfast and supper. 

In this manner oysters are sometimes prepared, 
and served up in large clam-shells. Boiled crabs 
are also cooked, minced and prepared in this 
way, and sent to the table in the back-shell of 
the crab> The scollops are all improved by 
mincing among them some hard-boiled eggs 
minced or chopped, or some raw egg beaten. 









GENERAL REMARKS. 

Good fresh beef is of a bright red color, 
«moothly grained and tender to the touch, the fat 
more white than yellow, the suet a pure white, 
and firm. The sirloin, the ribs and the rump 
are the proper joints for roasting, while, for 
stewing or boiling, the round or buttock, the 
shin, the brisket and the shoulder are considered 
more suitable. The finest and tenderest steaks 
are cut from the middle of the sirloin. 

One of the most useful articles in the economy 
of the kitchen is the dripping produced from roast 
beef. It must be taken from the pan under the 
meat before it becomes overheated or scorched by 
the fire, leaving sufiicient for basting. Dripping 
is prepared for future use in the following man- 
ner : Take it hot from the dripping-pan and pour 
it into boiling water, that all particles of cinder or 
other improper matter may fall to the bottom, and 
leave the pure fat on the surface. Collect these 



69 



70 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

cakes of fat, and by heating them in a jar placed 
in a sauce-pan of boiling water the whole will he- 
come a solid mass, and may be thus put aside for 
use. This process not only purifies dripping, but 
gives it a clear white color 

A well-roasted joint ought to have a nice brown 
tinge, and this is to be obtained only by careful 
basting, attention to the fire, and removing at the 
pToper time when experience tells that the joint 
is done. A quarter of an hour for each pound of 
meat is generally allowed for solid, heavy joints; 
but if required to be thoroughly roasted, a longer 
time must of course be given. 

The best parts of mutton for roasting are the 
leg, the shoulder and the loin ; for roast veal, the 
fillet, the breast, the loin and the shoulder. Roast 
lamb is usually dressed in quarters. All parts 
should be well jointed or cut by the butcher 
or cook, and the ribs of the forequarter broken 
across the centre, in order to accommodate the 
carver. 

Pork requires a longer time in roasting than 
other meats, and, like roast lamb, mutton and veal, 
must never be sent to the table in an underdone 
state. All these meats should be nicely ])rowned, 
without being burnt. 



MEATS. 71 

Frying has the advantage of affording a ready 
means of dressing in a savory manner many odd 
pieces of uncooked or cold meat which otherwise 
might be thrown away as useless. The skillful 
housewife, with the aid of a frying-pan and a few 
vegetables, such as onions and potatoes, with a 
slight seasoning, will make a small portion of 
meat dine a large family. In frying all meats, 
excepting those which are suflficiently fat in 
themselves, some kind of grease should be used, 
such as beef dripping, lard or butter. 

Baked meats are liable to become shriveled for 
lack of basting, and if done in a baker's oven they 
are also liable to partake of the flavor of the 
numerous articles w^hich are there prepared. 
Perhaps the only dishes which are better baked 
than roasted are bullock's heart and leg of pork, 
because, in roasting, they are liable to be scorched 
on the outside before they are thoroughly cooked 
in the inner parts. 

Broiling has the peculiarity of being applicable 
only to meat which is to be eaten immediately on 
being dressed. This is an advantage when expedi- 
tious cooking is required, but a disadvantage when 
an uncertainty exists as to the time at which the 
meat is to be eaten. The operation of broiling 



72 MES. portek's new cook-book. 

requires a clear, strong fire, with no smoke, and 
in turning the meat a knife or pair of small tongs 
should be used; a fork should never be used in 
turning, as it breaks the skin and allows the 
gravy to run out. Before placing the meat upon 
it the gridiron, should be heated for a few minutes, 
and the bars rubbed with a piece of brown paper, 
to prevent the meat from sticking to them. 

In boiling meat there is less waste than in 
roasting, and in most cases soup may be made 
of the liquor. There must be a sufficiency of 
water to cover the meat, and the utensils used 
must be large, in order to allow the meat perfect 
freedom. All portions of mutton and lamb may 
be roasted, but it is only the leg, neck and head 
that are boiled. 

Stewing is a much more savory and nutritious 
mode of cooking than boiling, because the sub- 
stance of the meat is partly in the liquor, and is 
seasoned to have a high relish or flavor. 

ROAST BEEP. 

Take a medium-sized joint, wash it, place it in 
a roasting-pan, season with pepper and salt, and 
dredge with a little flour. Pour into the pan 



MEATS. 73 

three half pints of water, and add a heaping 
tablespoonful of flour; stir well together, and 
place in a moderately hot oven ; baste frequently. 
When done and nicely browned, put it on a 
heated dish, remove a part of the fat from the 
gravy, and, if not sufficiently seasoned, more may 
be added. Baste the meat with a few spoor.fuls, 
then pour the gravy into a sauce-tureen and rsond 
to table with the meat. 

BEEP A LA MODE. 

Take a fine round of fresh beef, extract the 
bone and take away the fat. For a round weigh- 
ing ten pounds make a seasoning or stuffing in 
the following proportions : Half a pound of beef 
suet ; half a pound of grated bread-crumbs ; the 
crumbled yolks of three hard-boiled eggs; a large 
bundle of sweet marjoram, the leaves chopped ; 
another of sweet basil; four onions minced small; 
a large tablespoonful of mixed mace and nutmeg 
powdered. Season lightly with salt and cajenne. 
Stuff this mixture into the place from whence you 
took out the bone. Make numerous deep cuta 
about the meat, and stuJff them also. Skewer the 
moat into a proper shape, and secure its form by 
tying it round with tape. Put it into a clean 



74 MRS. poeter's new cook-book. 

tin oven or bake-pan, and pour over it a pint oi 
port wine. Put on the lid, and bake the beef 
slowly for five or six hours, or till it is thorouglily 
lone all through. If the meat is to be eaten hot, 
skim all the fat from the gravy, into which, after 
it is taken off the fire, stir in the beaten yolk of 
two eggs. If onions are disliked, you can omit 
them and substitute minced oysters. 

STEWED SHIN OP BEEF. 

Put a shin of beef on to stew in enough cold 
water to keep it covered until done. "When it boils 
remove the scum, and put one ounce and a half of 
salt to a gallon of water. Add a few cloves and 
some black pepper slightly bruised and tied up in 
muslin, some onions, a root of celery, a bunch 
of savory herbs, with some carrots and turnips. 
Gently stew for four or five hours. 

STEWED BRISKET OP BEEP. 

Put the part that has the hard fat into a stew- 
pot, with a small quantity of water ; let it boil up, 
and skim it thoroughly; then add carrots, turnips, 
onions, celery and a few pepper-corns. Stew till 
extremely tender; then take out all the flat bones 



MEATS. 75 

and remove all the fat from tne soup. Either 
serve that and the meat in a tureen, or the soup 
alone, and the meat on a dish, garnished with 
some vegetables. The following sauce is much 
admired served with the beef: Take half a pint 
of the soup, and mix it with a spoonful of catsup, 
a teaspoonful of made mustard, a little flour, a bit 
of butter and salt; boil all together a few minutes, 
then pour it round the meat. 

STEWED RUMP OP BEEP. 

Take three pounds of tender rump of beef; 
remove the skin and fat, cut the beef into pieces 
two inches square, and pour over it a quart of 
cold broth or gravy. When it boils add salt, if 
required, and a little cayenne, and keep it just 
simmering for a couple of hours; then add to it 
tlie grated rind of a large lemon, or of two small 
ones, and half an hour after stir in it a table- 
Fpoonful of rice-flour, smoothly mixed with a 
wineglassful of mushroom catsup and a dessert- 
spoonful of lemon-juice; in fifteen minutes it 
will be ready to serve. A glass and a half of 
port or of white wine will greatly improve this 
etew, which may likewise be flavored with a sauce 



70 MEs. portek's new cook-book. 

made with half a pint of port wine, the same of 
mushroom catsup, a quarter of a pint of walnut 
pickle, and a dessert-spoonful of cayenne vinegar, 
all well shaken together, and poured into a bottle 
containing the thin rind of a lemon and two 
fine, mellow anchovies of moderate size. A few 
delicately-fried forcemeat balls may be put into 
it after it is dished. 



BEEFSTEAK WITH ONIONS. 

Take a nice rumpsteak, and pound it with a 
rolling-pin until it is quite tender; flour and 
season ; put it into a frying-pan of hot lard and 
fry it. When nicely brown on both sides take 
it up and dredge with flour. Having ready boiled 
about two dozen onions, strain them in a colander 
and put them into the frying-pan, seasoning with 
pepper and salt; dredge in a little flour, and add 
a small lump of butter; place the pan over the 
fire and stir the onions frequently, to prevent 
their scorching. When they are soft and a 
little brown, return the steak to the pan, and 
heat all together. Place the steak on a large 
dish, pour the onions and gravy over it, and send 
to the table hot. 



MEATS. 77 

BEEFSTEAK FRENCH STYLE. 

Cut thin steaks from the finest and tenderest 
part of the rump; sprinkle over them pounded 
salt, a little cayenne and white pepper combined; 
lay them in a pan with an ounce of fresh butter 
cut in pieces, then work half a teaspoonful of 
flour with three ounces of fresh butter, as much 
parsley, minced exceedingly fine, as would lay on 
a shilling; roll it, and cut in large slices, lay it 
in a dish, squeeze the half of a lemon over the 
butter, and when the steaks are done lay them 
upon the butter. Have ready a quantity of raw 
peeled potatoes cut in thin slices and washed in 
milk and water; fry them in the butter and gravy 
left by the steak, and lay them round the dish ; 
they will be done when they are a rich brown. If 
necessary, add a little more seasoning, and serve. 

STUFFED BEEFSTEAK. 

Take some pieces of bread, scald them soft, mix 
with plenty of butter and a little pepper and salt. 
Lay the mixture upon one side of a pound of steak, 
cover it with the other, and sew it down with 
needle and thread. Salt and pepper the outside 
of the steak, and plaQp it in a dripping-pan with

half an inch of water. When baked brown on 
one side turn and bake the other. 



BEEFSTEAK PUDDING-. 

Prepare a good suet crust, and line a cake tin 
with it; put in layers of steak, with onions, 
tomatoes and mushrooms chopped, a seasoning 
of pepper, salt and cayenne, and half a tea- 
cupful of water before closing it. Bake from 
an hour and a half to two hours, and serve 
very hot. 

BEEP PIE. 

Take cold roast beef or steak, cut it into thin 
slices, and put a layer in a pie- dish ; shake in a 
little flour, pepper and salt, cut up a tomato or 
onion chopped very fine; then another layer of beef, 
and seasoning, and so on until the dish is filled. 
If you have any beef gravy, put it in ; if not, a 
little beef dripping and water enough to make 
suflicient gravy. Have ready one dozen potatoes 
well boiled and mashed, half a cuj) of milk or 
cream, and a little butter and salt. Spread it 
over the pie, as a crust, an inch thick; brush it 
over with e^g, and bake about twenty minutes. 



MEATS. 79 

BEEP CAKES. 

An excellent side-dish can be prepared by 
pounding some beef that is underdone with a little 
fal bacon or ham ; season with pepper, salt and a 
little onion ; mix them well and make into small 
cakes three inches long and half as wide and thick; 
fry them a little brown, and serve them in a good 
thick gravy. 

BEEF PATTIES. 

Shred underdone dressed beef wiQi a little fat 
season with pepper, salt and a little onion. Make 
plain paste ; roll it thin and cut it in shape like 
an apple-puff; fill it with the mince, pinch the 
edges, and fry them a nice brown. The paste 
should be made with a small quantKy of butter, 
egg and milk. 

BAKED BEEP TONGUE. 

Boil and skin the tongue, and SP^,son it with 
pepper and salt ; lay it in a j^an and pour a rich 
gravy over it; make deep incisions on the top 
and put herbs and bread-crumbs into them ; grate 
some bread over it, and bake fifteen or twenty 
minutes. Garnish with baked tomatoes or mush- 
rooms. 



80 MRS. pouter's new cook-book. 

STEWED TONGUE. 

After it has been boiled cut it in thick slices, 
and stew in rich gravy about three hours, until 
quite tender. This is a very nice corner-dLsh. 

CURRIED BEEF. 

Take about two ounces of butter and place 
them in a saucepan with two small onions cut 
up into slices, and let them fry till they are of 
a light brown ; then add a tablespoonful and a 
half of curry powder, and mix it up well. Now 
cut up the beef into pieces about an inch square; 
pour in from a quarter to a third of a pint of 
milk, and let it simmer for thirty minutes ; then 
take it off and place it in a dish with a little 
lemon-juice. While cooking stir it constantly, 
to prevent burning. Send it to table with a wall 
of mashed potatoes or rice round it. This is the 
Madras style, and a favorite dish at some of the 
hotels and first-class restaurants. 

SPICED BEEP. 

Take a piece of the round of beef weighing 
fifteen or sixteen pounds, wash it, remove the 
bone and skewer the meat into a proper shape; 



MEATS. 81 

then rub it well with salt, place it in a clean 
pickling-tub, sprinkle over it some more salt, 
close up the tub tightly, and let it remain for a 
week, turning and sprinkling each day with fresh 
Bait. It should then be well rubbed with two 
ounces of black pepper, a quarter of an ounce of 
mace, some powdered nutmeg, and put into an 
earthen stewing-pan, with a layer of suet under 
it; add two or three onions sliced and three or 
four cloves ; cover with water, and bake for five 
hours. When cold it is an excellent standing 
breakfast or supper dish, being as tender as 
potted beef. Boiled cabbage and parsnips are an 
excellent accompaniment to this dish. When the 
fat has been removed, the liquor in which the beef 
has been stewed makes excellent stock for soup. 

BOILED CORNED BEEP. 

Cut four or five pounds of lean from a cold 
round of beef, and put into a pot that will hold 
plenty of water. The water should be hot. The 
same care should be taken in skimming as for 
fresh meat. It is not too much to allow half an 
hour for every pound of meat after it has begun 
to boil. The excellence of corned beef depends 



82 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

very much upon its being boiled gently and long. 
If it is to be eaten cold, lay it, when boiled, into a 
coarse earthen dish or pan, and over it a clean 
board size of the meat; upon this put some heavy 
weight. Salt meat is much improved by pressing. 



ROAST LEG OF MUTTON. 

All mutton should hang in a cool place till 
quite tender before being used, but care should be 
taken that it does not acquire the least rust or 
taint. After carefully removing from a leg of 
mutton all the outside skin, put it into a pot of 
boiling water, with some salt, and cook for an 
hour before setting in the pan to roast. A second 
hour in the oven, after dredging with flour, add- 
ing three half pints of water to the roasting-pan 
and basting the meat every ten minutes with the 
liquor from the pot, will render it perfect. The 
remainder of the liquor in the pot makes an 
excellent foundation for soup. 



ROAST MUTTON WITH TOMATOES. 

Take a nice hindquarter of mutton, wash it, 
rub it with salt and pepper, put it into a baking-

pull witli a pint of water, and baste it well. Then 
prepare some tomatoes in the following manner : 
Take one dozen large, full-ripe tomatoes, slit them 
into four, but do not sever the pieces entirely at 
the bottom; make a stuffing of some bread-crumbs, 
pepper, salt, butter and a very little sugar; mix it 
well ; remove part of the seed from the tomatoes, 
and fill with the stuffing. Put them in, and roast 
with the mutton. When done put them in the 
dish, around the mutton, and pour over some 
gravy. Tomatoes done in this manner make a 
delicious accompaniment to all kinds of cooked 
meats. They also make a nice breakfast dish. 

BOILED SHOULDER OP MUTTON. 

When the shoulder has hung till tender, bone 
it and rub the outside with salt. It is better to let 
it remain for a day or two in a deep dish, turning 
it over each day and rubbing it with salt. Then 
sprinkle over the inside one teaspoonful of pepper 
and half a teaspoonful of powdered mace. Spread 
twenty oysters over the inside; roll the meat up 
tightly and tie securely; put it into the stew-pan 
or boiler, with just enough boiling water to cover 
it; throw in six pepper-corns, or seeds of the red 



84 MEs. porter's new cook-book. 

pepper, and one onion cliopped ; shut the cover 
over very closely, and stew; twenty minutes' cook- 
ing for each pound of meat is the proper time 
Stew twenty-four oysters in a pint of good stock 
or gravy; add a tablespoonful of butter and 
enough flour to thicken it. When the meat is 
done lay it in a good-sized platter and pour the 
gravy over it. 

SPICED SHOULDER OF MUTTON. 

Take a tender shoulder of mutton, bone it care- 
fully, and for every pound of meat mix two ounces 
of brown sugar, one salt-spoonful of cloves, one 
teaspoonful each of mace and pepper and half a 
salt-spoonful of ginger; rub these spices thoroughly 
into the meat; lay it into a deep dish, and the 
next day rub in two teaspoonfuls of salt for every 
pound of meat, and add one pint and a half of 
good beef gravy for the whole joint. Turn the 
meat over ; rub it well with this pickle every day 
for a week or ten days, letting it remain in the 
pickle, after each rubbing, all the time. At the 
end of the week or ten days, roll it up tightly, 
bind with a string and stew gently in beef broth 
four hours. Serve hot in its own gravy, and eat 
with any piquante sauce or catsup. 



MEATS. 85 

MUTTON STEAKS WITH CUCUMBERS. 

Quarter cucumbers and lay them into a deep 
dish; sprinkle them with salt, and pour vinegar 
over them. Fry the chops of a fine brown and 
put them into a stew-pan; drain the cucumbers 
and put them over the steaks; add sliced onions, 
pepper and salt ; pour hot water or weak broth on 
them; stew and skim well. 

MUTTON SAUSAGE. 

Take one pound of a leg of mutton that has 
been roasted or boiled, chop it very fine, season 
it with pepper, salt, mace and nutmeg; add six 
ounces of beef suet, some sweet herbs, a few 
anchovies and a pint of oysters chopped fine, 
half pound of grated bread-crumbs, the yolks 
and whites of two eggs well beaten. When 
well mixed put in small jars. When used fry 
iu small cakes. 

ROAST LAMB. 

From a forequarter of lamb cut off the scrag 
one joint from the shoulder; saw off" the chine 
bone, and also the bone of the breasi, and joint

it thoroughly; crack the ribs in the middle ; cut 
off the thick skin which covers the lower part of 
the breast, and break the bone of the shoulder, to 
allow the knuckle to twist around, and secure it 
in its place with a skewer from beneath the breast 
right up the knuckle. Put two large skewers at 
the thin end ; pass the spit between the skewers 
and the ribs through the thick part at the 
shoulder. The meat should be placed before a 
clear, brisk fire, but not very near at first. Put a 
little water in the dripping-pan, and baste with 
that till the meat begins to cook, adding a little 
fresh butter. Then place it nearer to the fire, 
and when more than half done baste the meat 
frequently with the gravy. Let it roast until 
thoroughly done and a fine brown is given to it. 
A forequarter of lamb (comprising the shoulder, 
neck and breast) weighing eight to ten pounds 
will require two hours to be well cooked. The 
hindquarter (the leg and loin) may be roasted in 
the same manner as the forequarter, the only dif- 
ference being that in cooking the former requires 
about one half hour less time than the latter. 
Before sending to the table sprinkle the meat 
with the juice of a lemon, and then serve with 
mint sauce. New potatoes, asparagus, green peas 



MEATS. 87 

and sj^inacli are the vegetables to be eaten with 
roast lamb. An excellent recipe for making mint 
sauce will be found under the head of Sauces. 

BOILED LEG OP LAMB. 

Choose a ewe leg, as there is more fat on it; 
saw off the knuckle, trim off the flap and the 
thick skin on the back of it; soak it in warm 
water for three hours, then boil it gently (time ac- 
cording to size) ; pour a little oyster sauce over it. 

The loin may be fried in steaks and served 
round, garnished with dried or fried parsley or 
epinach; it may also be served with parsley and 
butter, or with oyster sauce. 

LAMB CUTLETS AND SPINACH. 

Take six or eight cutlets from a neck of lamb, 
and shape them by taking the thick part of the 
chine bone, and trimming off most of the fat and 
all of the skin, scraping the top jDart of the bones 
quite clean. Brush the cutlets over witli egg, 
sprinkle with bread-crumbs and season with pep- 
per and salt. Then dip them into clarified butter, 
sprinkle over a few more bread-crumbs, fry them 
over a brisk fire, turning them when required. 



88 MES. poeter's new cook-book. 

Lay tliem before the fire to drain, and then 
arrange them on a dish with spinach in the 
centre, which should be previously well boiled, 
drained, chopped and seasoned. Peas, asparagus 
or beans may be substituted for the spinach. 



LAMB PIE. 

Take from two to four pounds of lamb steaks, 
and after removing the fat and bone cut them in 
pieces four inches square; season with a little 
pepper and salt, and put them into a stew-pot 
with a small quantity of water; let them stew 
for about three-quarters of an hour. Make a 
nice paste, allowing half a pound of fresh butter 
to a pound of flour; mix half the butter with the 
flour, gradually adding cold water sufficient to 
make a dough ; roll out the dough into a large, 
thin sheet, and spread over with the knife the 
rest of the batter; fold it, sprinkle with a little 
flour, then divide it into two sheets, and roll 
out each of them ; that intended for the upper 
crust should be the thickest. Cover with the 
under crust the bottom and sides of a pie dish, 
and put in the stewed lamb with its gravy; 
scatter over it a few blades of mace; add some 



MEATS. 89 

sliced potatoes and boiled turnips sliced. Spread 
over it a thick layer of the green tops of boiled 
asparagus, adding a few bits of fresh butter; put 
on the paste-lid, and close the edges by crimping 
them. Make a cross-slit on the top; place the 
pie in the oven and bake it to a light brown. 
Boiled cauliflower, seasoned with nutmeg, may 
be substituted for asparagus tops. 



ROAST FILLET OP VEAL. 

TuE best parts of veal for roasting are the fillet, 
the loin and the shoulder. Select a nice fillet, 
take out the bone, fill up the space with stuffing, 
and also put a good layer under the fat. Truss 
it of a good shape by drawing the fat round, and 
tie it up with tape. Put it some distance from 
the fire at first, and baste with butter. It should 
have careful attention and frequent basting, that 
the fat may not burn. Eoast from three to four 
hours, according to the size. After it is dished 
pour melted butter over it; serve with ham or 
bacon, and fresh cucumbers if in season. Veal, 
like all other meat, should be well washed in cold 
water before cooking. Cold fillet of veal is very 
good stewed with tomatoes and an onion or two. 

8« 



yO MES. PORTEE's new COOK-BOOK. 

BOILED FILLET OF VEAL. 

Choose a small, delicate fillet; prepare as for 
roasting, or stuff it with an oyster forcemeat; after 
having washed it thoroughly cover it with milk 
and water in equal quantities, and let it boil very 
gently three and a half or four hours, keeping it 
well skimmed. Send it to the table with a rich 
white sauce, or, if stuffed with oysters, a tureen 
of oyster sauce. Garnish with stewed celery and 
slices of bacon. A boiled tongue should be served 
with it. 

BOILED LOIN OF VEAL. 

Take about ten pounds of the best end of the 
loin, leave the kidney in with all its fat, skewer 
or bind down the flap, lay the meat into cold 
water and boil it as gently as possible from two 
hours and a quarter to two and a half, clearing 
off the scum perfectly, as in dressing the fillet. 
Send it to table with oyster sauce, or with white 
sauce well flavored with lemon-juice, and with 
parsley boiled, pressed dry and finely chopped. 
When the meat is white and small, and it is dressed 
with care and served with good sauces, this is 
an excellent dish, and often more acceptable to 
persons of delicate habits than roast veal.

VEAL STEW. 

Cut four pounds of veal into strips three inches 
long and one thick; peel twelve large potatoes, 
and cut them into slices one inch thick; spread a 
hiyer of sliced salt pork with salt, pepper, sage 
and onion on the bottom of the pot, then a layer 
of potatoes, then a layer of veal seasoned. Use 
up the veal thus. Over the last layer of veal put 
a layer of slices of salt pork, and over the whole 
a layer of potatoes. Pour in water till it rises an 
inch over the whole; cover it close; heat it fifteen 
minutes, and simmer it two hours. 

VEAL CUTLETS. 

From a fillet of veal take two or three cutlets ; 
pound, wash, and then dry them on a clean cloth; 
season with pepper and salt. Beat up two eggs 
with one gill of milk, and pour over the cutlets ; 
take half a pint of bread-crumbs, or fine crackers; 
season with pepper and salt, and place them in 
the cutlets, pressing them with the back of a spoon 
into the meat. Fry slowly in hot lard, and when 
well done and nicely browned pour over tliem 
some of the gravy, and send to the table liot. 
Mushroom sauce is considered by many e2)icures 



92 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

to be an indispensable accompaniment to veal 
cutlets. The addition of a little cream in frying 
is also an improvement to the dish. 

VEAL CUTLETS WITH HERBS. 

Chop up all sorts of sweet herbs, mushrooms, 
onions, pepper and salt, with a spoonful of butter; 
dip the cutlets into this, and reduce the sauce, to 
make it stick; then dip the cutlets into a mixture 
of egg and bread-crumbs, and set them into an 
oven to bake; add a glass of white wine to the 
sauce, skim it well, and when the cutlets are done 
lay them on a dish, pour over the sauce, and send 
to table hot. 

VEAL ROLLS. 

Cut a few slices from a cold fillet of veal half 
an inch thick; rub them over with beaten egg; 
lay a thin slice of fat bacon over each piece of 
veal; brush these with the egg, and over this 
spread forcemeat thinly; roll up each piece 
tightly, egg and bread-crumb them, and fry 
them a rich brown. Serve with mushroom sauce 
or brown gravy. Fry the rolls from ten t ^ fifteen 
minutes. A nice breakfast or sui^per dish

SCOLLOPS OP COLD VEAL. 

Mince the meat extremely small, and set it 
over the fire; season with some grated nutmeg, 
a little pepper and salt, and a little cream. Then 
put it into the scollop-shells, and cover them with 
crumbs of bread, over which put some bits of 
butter, and brown before the fire. Send to the 
table hot, accompanied with catsup or mushroom 
sauce. These scollops form an excellent side-dish 
at dinner, and are nice at breakfast. 

POTTED VEAL AND BACON. 

Cut thin slices of veal and the same quantity 
of bacon ; then rub together some dried sweet 
basil or summer savory very fine, until reduced to 
a powder ; place in a stew-pan a layer of bacon 
and a layer of veal; then sprinkle over it the 
powdered herbs, a little grated horseradish, then 
again bacon and veal, and then herbs and horse- 
radish and a little salt. On this squeeze the 
ji Ice of a lemon ; then cover very tightly and 
put in an oven. Let it bake two or three hours; 
take it out and drain ofi" all the gravy; pour over 
a little catsup, and press down with a heavy 
weight; then put it away in a pot tightly covered.

STEWED CALF'S HEAD. 

Remove tlie hair from a nice large calf's head : 
take out the brain, wash the head very clean, and 
soak it for a quarter of an hour. Boil until quite 
tender in just enough water to cover it; then care- 
fully take out the bones without spoiling th( 
appearance of the head. Season with a littk 
salt and cayenne and a grated nutmeg. Poui 
over it the liquor in which it has been boiled 
adding a gill of vinegar and two large tablespoon 
fuls of capers or of pickled green nasturtium seed^, 
Let it stew very slowly for half an hour. Havt, 
ready some forcemeat balls made of minced veal 
suet, grated bread-crumbs, grated lemon-peel, and 
sweet marjoram, adding beaten yolk of egg to 
keep the other ingredients together. Put in the 
forcemeat balls, then stew it slowly a quarter of 
an hour longer, adding some bits of butter rolled 
in flour to enrich the gravy. Send it to the table 
hot. 

STEWED CALF'S FEET. 

When properly cleaned, rub the feet over with 
pepper, a very little salt and mace; cut them into 
moderately-sized pieces and put them into a 



MEAfS. 95 

slew-pan with a little shallot and a beefsteak, 
also cut into pieces. Cover all with cold water, 
and let tliem simmer together for three hours. 
When quite tender take them off the fire; strain 
(he gravy through a sieve. The next day, when 
cold, take off all the fat; boil a small quantity of 
saffron in cream, and a little cayenne pepper; mix 
it with the gravy, and warm tlie whole without 
boiling; one foot and one pound of steak wili 
make a dish for a small family. 

POTTED CALF'S FEET. 

After a thorough cleansing, boil the feet jBve 
hours. Take half a pint of the jelly in which 
they are boiled and flavor it with nutmeg, garlic 
and pounded ham, and let them simmer together 
a few minutes. Cut up the feet into small pieces, 
and season them; dip a mould into cold water and 
put in the meat, mixed with a little grated lemon- 
peel and minced parsley. Some persons add beet- 
root, baked or boiled, cut in slices and mixed witli 
the meat. When this is arranged in the mould, 
fill up with the flavored jelly. Turn out when 
quite cold. The remainder of the jelly in which 
the feet were boiled can be used as a sweet jelly.

ROASTED CALF'S LIVER STUFFED. 

Take a nice, fresh liver, make a hole in it 
lengthways with a large knife, but do not cut 
tlie hole entirely through ; fill the opening with 
forcemeat made of some of the liver parboiled, 
and some fat bacon minced fine, with some 
powdered sweet herbs, and some spice and grated 
bread-crumbs, pepper and salt. Lard the liver 
well with fat bacon, and flour it; roast it and 
baste it well with butter. Serve hot with gravy 
sauce. 

FRIED CALF'S LIVER. 

Cut it in slices, season with pepper and salt, 
dredge with flour, and fry brown in lard. Have 
it perfectly done. Serve in its gravy. 

Calf's heart dressed in this way is also very 
nice. 

STEWED KIDNEYS. 

Oct them through the centre, take out the 
core, pull the kernels apart, pour them into the 
sauce-pan without any water, and set them on 
ihe fire, where they may get hot; they should 
not be allowed to boil. In half an hour put the 
kidneys into cold water, wash them clean, and 



MEATS. 



97 



put them back into tlie sauce-pan, with just 
enough water to cover them. ' Boil one hour, 
then take them up and clean off the fat and 
skin ; put into the frying-pan some butter, pep- 
per and salt, dredge in a little flour, and add 
a pint of hot water ; then put in the kidneys, let 
them simmer twenty minutes, stirring them often. 
Do not let them dry, as it hardens them. This 
is a very nice breakfast dish. 

BAKED SWEETBREADS. 

In this and every other method of dressing 
sweetbreads they should be prepared by blanch- 
ing or whitening and then parboiled. Take two 
large sweetbreads, and after having followed the 
above directions lard them with very thin slips 
of bacon. Put them into a shallow pan, and 
place under each sweetbread a piece of good fresh 
butter with a little flour mixed into it. Mix the 
juice and grated yellow rind of a lemon with a 
glass of good white wine, and pour into the pan ; 
season also with grated nutmeg ; or for sauce you 
may use mushroom catsup with a little salad oil 
stirred into it. 

Sweetbreads spoil very rapidly, and should 



98 MRS. porter's new COOK-SOOK. 

never be used unless they are perfectly fresh; 
never attempt to keep them until next day, ex- 
cept in cold weather, and then on ice. Those 
taken from the breast of the calf are the best. 

FRIED SWEETBREADS. 

Lay the sweetbreads in warm water, with a 
half teaspoonful of salt in it, for an hour, to make 
them white, then put them into cold water, and 
let them remain over the fire until they have 
boiled ten minutes. Cut them into slices, brush 
them with egg and sprinkle over with bread- 
crumbs. Fry them in butter; each sweetbread 
will require three-quarters of an ounce of butter. 
Serve with some good gravy, such as you would 
prepare for a fowl. 

STEWED SWEETBREADS. 

Parboil two nice sweetbreads ; when cold, lara 
them down the middle with bits of bacon, then 
with slices of lemon-peel on each side, and then 
with small pieces of pickled cucumber. Stew 
them gently in rich gravy thickened with flour; 
add a little mushroom catsup to the taste, and the 
juice of a lemon. 



MEATS. 99 

SWEETBREADS AND OYSTERS. 

Soak and blanch three large and fine sweet- 
breads, cut them into quarters and remove the 
pi])e. Take three dozen large fresh oysters, strain 
ofl' the liquor, season it with powdered nutmeg 
and mace and a little cayenne. Put the quar- 
tered sweetbreads into a stew-pan, and pour over 
them enough of the oyster-liquor to cover them 
well, adding, if you have it, three large spoon- 
fuls of the gravy of roast veal and a quarter of 
a pound of fresh butter cut into four bits, each 
bit rolled or dredged in flour. When the sweet- 
breads a;re done put in the oysters, first removing 
their gristle or hard part, and take them out 
again as soon as they are plumped, which should 
be in five minutes. If allowed to boil, the oysters 
■will shrivel and become hard and tasteless. Add 
at the last two wineglasses of cream, and shake 
the pan about for a few minutes. Serve up in a 
deep dish. 

ROAST PORK. 

The parts of pork most suitable for roasting 
arc the loin, the leg, the saddle, the fillet, the 
shoulder and the spare-rib. The loins of young 



100 MBS. porter's new cook-book. 

and delicate pork are roasted with the skin on, 
and this is scored in regular stripes of about a 
quarter inch wide with the point of a sharp knife 
before the joints are laid to the fire. The skin of 
the leg also is just cut through in the same man- 
ner. This is done to prevent its blistering and to 
render it more easy to carve, as the skin or crack- 
ling becomes so crisp and hard in the cooking 
that it is otherwise sometimes difiicult to divide 
it. At first the meat must be placed at some dis- 
tance from the fire, in order that it may be heated 
through before the skin hardens or begins to 
brown, and the basting (should be constant ; let it 
cook until thoroughly done and well browned 
before removing frcm the spit. A little clari- 
fied butter or salad oil may be brushed over the 
skin at first, particularly should the meat not be 
very fat, but unless remarkably lean it will 
speedily yield sufficient dripping to baste it with. 
Joints from which the fat has been pared will 
require, of course, far less roasting than tliose on 
which the crackling is retained. Brown gravy 
and apple or tomato sauce are the usual accom- 
paniments to all roasts of pork, except a suck- 
ing pig. Cold roast pork, sliced, is very good for 
breakfast or tea. 



MEATS. 101 

ROAST PIQ. 

Take a fat pig three weeks old, wasli it thor- 
oughly inside and out ; chop the liver fine with 
bread-crumbs, onions, parsley, pepper, salt and 
some potatoes boiled and mashed; make it into 
a paste with butter and egg. Put this stuffing 
into the body of the pig and sew it up; put 
it in a baking-pan with some water in the bottom 
and roast over a clear fire, basting it well with 
butter ; rub it frequently with a piece of lard tied 
in a clean rag. When well done lay the pig on 
its knees in a dish, and put a red apple or pick- 
led mango in its mouth. Put some of the stuff- 
ing in a bowl with a glass of wine and some of 
the dripping. Serve some with the roast pig, 
and the rest in a gravy-boat. 

PORK CHOPS. 

Cut the chops about half an inch thick, trim 
them neatly, place a frying-pan on the fire, and 
put into it a bit of butter ; as soon as the pan is 
hot put in the chops, turning them often until 
brown all over ; they will be sufficiently done in 
about fifteen minutes. Take one upon a plate 
and try it ; if done, season it with a little finely- 



102 MES. poetee's new cook-book. 

minced onion, powdered sage and pepper and salt. 
Serve hot with a dish of apple sauce. 

FRESH PORK POT-PIE. 

Boil a spare-rib, after removing all the fat 
and cracking the bones, until tender ; remove the 
scum as it rises, and when tender season with salt 
and pepper ; half an hour before time for serving 
the dinner thicken the gravy with a little flour. 
Have ready another kettle, into which remove all 
the bones and most of the gravy, leaving only 
sufficient to cover the pot half an inch above the 
rim that rests on the stove ; put in the crust, cover 
tight, and boil steadily twenty-five minutes. To 
prepare the crust, work into light dough a small 
bit of batter, roll it out thin, cut it in small square 
cakes, and lay them on the moulding-board until 
very light ; if made with brewers' yeast, the but- 
ter should be melted in the wetting of the crust 
and rolled out before rising, as the first efferves- 
cence of brewers' yeast is the strongest ; work the 
dough well before making up the cakes. 

PORK APPLE-PIE. 

Make the crust in the usual way, spread it 
over a large deep plate, cut some slices of fat 



MEATS. 103 

pork very thin ; also slice some nice, juicy ap- 
ples, mako a layer of apples and then of pork, 
with a little allspice, pepper and sugar between. 
Make four or five layers of each, and put a crust 
over the top. Bake one hour. 

BOILED HAM. 

Soak the ham for twelve or fourteen hours, lay 
it in a suitable vessel and cover plentifully with 
cold water ; bring it very slowly to boil, and clear 
off the scum. Then draw back the sauce-pan to 
the edge of the stove, that the ham may be sim- 
mered softly, but steadily, until tender. A bunch 
of herbs, a bay-leaf and a few carrots thrown in 
will improve it. When sufficiently boiled strip 
off the skin and strew fine raspings over it. The 
time required for boiling varies much according 
to the size of the ham, averaging four hours 
and a half. 

FRIED SAUSAGE. 

Sausages are best when quite fresh made. Put 
a bit of butter or dripping into a clean frying- 
pan; as soon as it is melted (before it gets hot) 
put in the sausages and shake the pan for a min- 



104 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

ute, and keep turning them: be careful not to 
break or prick them in so doing ; fry them over a 
very slow fire till they are nicely browned on all 
sides. When they are done lay them on a hair- 
sieve and place before the fire for a few minutes, 
to drain the fat from them. The secret of frying 
sausages is to let them get hot very gradually; 
they will not burst if they are fresh. The com- 
mon practice to prevent their bursting is to prick 
them with a fork, but this lets the gravy out. 

SAUSAGE DUMPLINGS. 
Make one pound of flour and two ounces of 
drippings or chopped suet into a firm paste by 
adding water enough to enable you to knead the 
whole together. Divide this paste into twelve 
equal parts; roll each of these out sufficiently 
large to enable you to fold up one pork sausage 
in it; roll the edge of the paste to fasten the 
sausage securely in it, and as you finish each 
dumpling drop it gently into a large sauce-pan 
containing plenty of boiling water, and when the 
whole is finished allow them to boil gently by 
the side of the fire one hour ; then take them up 
with a spoon free from water, place them on a 
dish, and eat while hot.

GENERAL REMARKS. 

Poultry should invariably be purchased young. 
If old and tough, fowls are never as savory when 
cooked as when young and tender. This applies 
especially to ducks and geese. The flesh of young 
fowls will be firm and fleshy to the touch, and 
heavy in proportion to their size; the skin should 
be clear, white and finely grained, the toes pliable 
and easily broken when bent back. All kinds of 
poultry, and turkeys especially, are improved by 
hanging a day or two, unless the weather should 
be exceedingly sultry. Dark-legged fowls are 
best roasted, while the white-legged ones should 
be chosen for boiling. In dressing poultry, care 
should be taken not to break the gall : a thorough 
cleansing in every part is also necessary. The 
hairs should be singed off with a well-lighted 
piece of writing paper, holding the fowl before a 
hot fire. Poultry of all kinds should be thor- 
oughly cooked and handsomely browned. 



109 



106 MRS. poeter's new cook-book. 

Game is never good when very fresh, but it 
does not follow that it should destroy the appetice, 
when sent to the table, by its offensive odor. The 
fine flavor and tenderness of the flesh depend 
almost entirely on its being allowed to hang a 
reasonable time before cooking. Venison, if kept 
to the proper time, is the most tender of all meats, 
but care is necessary to bring it into a fitting state 
for table without its becoming offensive; a free 
current of air materially assists in preserving its 
sweetness, while a close, damp atmosphere is de- 
structive to this as well as all other kinds of 
meat. Should any moisture appear on its sur- 
face, it must be wiped carefully with a soft, 
dry cloth. The haunch is generally regarded 
as the prime and favorite joint of venison, although 
the neck and shoulder are also excellent stewed in 
various ways or made into pasties. Young hares 
and rabbits are nutritious and easily digested; 
when old, the reverse. Partridges, like most birds, 
should be hung up for a day or two to ripen, 
and may be chosen by nearly the same tests as 
poultry. Wild birds need no scalding before 
being picked. They are much more delicious 
than domestic fowls, which is owing to the con- 
trast of living. They have free range in the

3peu air, and choose their own food, which pro- 
duces a delicate texture of flesh. 

ROAST TURKEY. 

In cold weather a turkey should hang at least a 
week before it is cooked. Draw and clean it with 
great care, taking particular pains not to break 
the gall bladder. Pour cold water plentifully 
through it, singe with writing paper, dry, and 
wipe clean. Fill the body with a dressing made 
with bread-crumbs, a slice of sweet, fat pork 
(boiled so that it will chop tender), thyme, 
parsley, pepper, salt, grated lemon-peel and 
mace. Before putting it in the oven cover the 
breast with very thin slices of salt pork; roast, 
and baste frequently, for an hour and a half or 
two hours, in a not too hot oven. Garnish with 
a chain of fine fried sausages and green parsley, 
or with small crimped paper rosettes and celer;)? 
tops. Serve with cranberry sauce. 

BOILED TURKEY. 

Select a plump, not too large, hen turkey for 
boiling; draw, clean and singe the bird smoothly 
and with great precaution. Cut off the head and 



108 MBS. portek's new cook-book. 

neck, cut the skin around the first joint of the 
legs and draw them off. Fill the breast with raw 
oyster? and a dressing made of bread, chopped 
celery, a little pork and seasoning. Dress it so 
as to make it look round and plump as possible. 
Wrap it in a cloth and place it in boiling water, 
clear off all the scum which rises, and simmer 
gently two hours. Garnish with green celery 
tops and small crisp slices of fried bacon. A 
ham is often served with boiled turkey. Serve 
with oyster sauce. 

ROAST GOOSE. 

Select a young, tender and fat goose; draw, 
clean and wipe thoroughly dry, inside and out: 
save the giblets for the gravy; fill the body with 
a stuffing of bread, sage, thyme, one or two par- 
boiled onions chopped fine, some mashed Irish 
potatoes and a very little butter. Add salt and 
pejiper and yolk of egg; truss it, and roast it at 
a brisk fire; baste the same as turkey. Pour off 
most of the fat that drips from the goose, or the 
gravy will be too rich. After boiling the giblets 
in a sauce- pan by themselves, seasoning with salt 
and pepper and adding a little butter, cut off the 



POULTRY AND GAME. 109 

neck and chop up the heart, liver and gizzard 
and serve in the gravy, after it is well skimmed. 
Unite the two gravies and serve them up in a 
gravy-tureen. Apple sauce is indispensable as .an 
accompaniment to this dish, 

BOILED GOOSE. 

After it is well dressed singe it thoroughly. 
Have ready a dressing prepared of bread-crumbs 
seasoned with pepper, salt and butter, with the 
addition of two finely-chopped onions, a little 
sage and more pepper than would be used for 
turkey. Fill the body and close it firmly; put 
it in cold water, and boil it gently an hour if 
tender, if not, longer; serve with giblet sauce. 
The onions can be omitted if not relished. 

ROAST DUCK. 

Prepare for roasting two fine, fat young ducks 

in the same manner as for roast goose. Stuff 

with sage, onion and thyme, bread-crumbs and 

butter; baste well with salt and water and their 

own gravy. Roast one hour, or until thoroughly 

done and finely browned. Serve with cranberry 

jelly or apple sauce. 
i» 



110 MRS. PORTEK's new COOK-BOOK. 

STEWED DUCK OR GOOSE. 
Take a couple of young ducks, or a tender fat 
goose, and after preparing for cooking the same 
way as roast goose or duck, half roast before a 
slow fire. Then cut either down neatly into joints, 
and put them into a stew-pan, with a pint of good 
beef gravy, a few leaves of sage and mint cut 
small, pepper and salt and a bit of onion shred 
as fine as possible. Let it simmer for a quarter 
of an hour, skimming it thoroughly ; then add a 
pint of green peas or rice mixed with a little port 
wine ; put in a piece of butter and a little flour, 
and give it one boil. Serve hot in one dish. 

ROAST FOWL OR CAPON. 
Fowl and capons are roasted and served as 
turkeys, with the addition of egg sauce, but they 
require proportionally less time at the fire, and 
are seldom stuffed. A full-grown fowl will require 
three-quarters of an hour to be well roasted, a 
capon an hour and a quarter. A large fowl may 
be stufied the same as a turkey. 

ROAST FOWL, FRENCH STYLE. 
Take a fine, plump fowl, fill the breast with a 
good forcemeat and roast in the usual manner. 



POULTRY AND GAME. Ill 

When nearly done remove the fowl from the fire, 
pour tepid butter over it in every part and spread 
thickly with very fine bread-crumbs; sprinkle 
tliese again with butter, and dip the fowl into 
more crumbs. Place it to the fire, and when 
of a clear, light brown all over put it carefully 
into a dish, and serve with lemon sauce and with 
gravy thickened and mixed with plenty of minced 
parsley, or with brown gravy and any other sauce 
usually served with fowls. 

BROILED FOWL. 
Split it down the back, season well with salt 
and pepper, and put it on the gridiron with the 
inner part next to the fire, which must be very 
clear and brisk. Hold the gridiron at a con- 
siderable distance from the fire until the fowl is 
nearly done; then turn it, taking care that it 
does not burn. Broil until it is well browned, 
and serve with stewed mushrooms or a sauce 
made of pickled mushrooms. If the fowl is very 
large, half roast it, cut it into four quarters, and 
then broil it on the gridiron. The time required 
for cooking is from a half to three-quarters of an 
hour. A duck may also be broiled in the same 
way, but it must be young and tender. 



112 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

BOILED FOWL. 

Boiled fowls are prepared in the same manner 
us boiled turke}'-. Drawn butter seasoned with 
parsley or celery is the most common sauce used. 
Liver sauce is good, but when oysters can be had 
oyster sauce is generally preferable. 

STEWED CHICKEN. 

Select a pair of young and plump chickens, 
and after a careful cleansing cut them into joints; 
season well with pepper and salt and a little 
powdered mace; put them into the stew-pan with 
a pint to a pint and a half of water, according to 
their size; let them simmer over a slow fire, stir- 
ring in a little flour mixed with butter. If neces- 
sary add more seasoning, and serve hot in a heated 
dish. 

STEAMED CHICKEN. 
Clean them carefully, split them down the back 
and lay them in a pan, the inside part down ; pour 
about a half pint of water into the pan and cover 
them with another pan; let them steam twenty 
minutes, and bake. When nearly done pepper 
them nicely, and grate some bread-crumbs over 
them. Make a rich gravy, and serve hot. 



POULTRY AND GAME. 113 

PRIED CHICKEN. 

Take two fiue young chickens, clean them care- 
fully, and wipe them thoroughly dry. Put them 
mto the frying-pan, season with pepper and salt 
and dredge them with flour. Fry in lard till 
richly browned on both sides; take them out and 
keep them near the fire; skim the gravy carefully 
in which the chickens have been fried, mix with 
it half a pint of cream, season with mace, pepper, 
salt and parsley; pour it over the chickens, and 
serve hot. 

CHICKEN BAKED IN RICE. 

Cut two small, tender chickens into joints, as 
for a fricassee; season well with pepper and salt, 
and lay them in a pudding-dish lined with slices 
of ham or bacon; add a pint of veal gravy and 
an onion finely minced, fill up the dish with 
boiled rice well pressed; fill the dish to its utmost 
capacity; cover it with a paste of flour and water. 
Bake one hour, and serve before taking off the 
paste. 

FRICASSEED CHICKEN. 

Cut off the wings and legs of three small 
chickens; separate the breasts from the backs;

divide the backs crosswise; cut off the necks 
and clean the gizzards; put them with the livers 
and other parts of the chickens (after being 
thoroughly washed) into a sauce-pan. Add salt, 
pepper and a little mace; cover with water, stew 
till tender, and take them up. Thicken a half 
pint of water with two spoonfuls of flour rubbed 
into four ounces of butter; add a tumbler of new 
milk; boil all together a few minutes, then add 
eight spoonfuls of white wine, stirring it in care- 
fully, so as not to allow it to curdle. Put in the 
chickens, and shake the pan until they are 
sufficiently heated. Green peas, lima beans, 
asparagus tops or mashed potatoes are excellent 
accompaniments. Chicken fricassee is a nice side- 
dish for company. ^ 

CHICKEN PIE. 

Take a pair of nice, tender chickens, clean 
them thoroughly and cut up into small pieces; 
wash well and let them cook for twenty minutes 
in water sufficient to cover them. Mix a table- 
spoonful of flour in cold water to a thin j^aste, 
and stir in the gravy; add a lump of butter, and 
season thoroughly with pepper and salt; let all

it butter to the depth of one quarter of an inch; 
roll up and roll out again, and repeat the opera- 
tion two or three times; put in the chicken, and 
put on the top crust, and pinch the edges well 
together; cut a slit in the top crust. Bake till 
the crust is slightly browned. 

CHICKEN PUFFS. 
Mince up together the breast of a chicken, 
some lean ham, half an anchovy, a little parsley, 
some shalot and lemon-peel, and season these 
with pepper, salt, cayenne and beaten mace. 
Let this be on the fire for a few minutes, in a 
little good white sauce. Cut some thinly-rolled- 
out puff paste into squares, putting on each some 
of the mince, turn the paste over, fry them in 
boiling lard and serve them up on a salver. 
These puffs are very good cold, and they form a 
convenient supper-dish. 

CHICKEN GUMBO. 
Prepare two young chickens as for a fricassee. 
Mix a tablespoonful of good butter with a tea-

spoonful of flour, and put into a stew-pan witb 
an onion minced finely; brown over a brisk fire, 
and then add a quart of water and a quarter of 
a peck of ochras, first sliced thin and then chop- 
ped ; season with a very little salt, cover the pan, 
and let the whole stew together till the ochras aro 
entirely dissolved; then put in the pieces of 
chicken, and cook for half an hour, or until 
they are thoroughly done. Serve up hot in a 
deep dish. An equal quantity of tomatoes cut 
small may be added to the ochras; no water 
will be required if tomatoes are used, as their 
iuice will supply ample liquid. 

ROAST PIGEONS. 
Pigeons lose their flavor by being kept more 
than a day after they are killed. They may be 
prepared and roasted or broiled the same as 
chickens; they will require from twenty to thirty 
minutes' cooking. Make, a gravy of the giblets, 
season it with pepper and salt and add a little 
flour and butter. 

BOILED PIGEONS. 
Truss the pigeons the same as boiled fowls; put 
them into boiling water, season with a little salt, 



POULTRY AND GAME. 117 

aud in about fifteen minutes lift them out, pour 
over them parsley and butter, and send a tureen 
of it to the table with the pigeons. 

PIGEON PIE. 
Cut into quarters four young pigeons and 
sprinkle them with pepper, salt and herb season- 
ing; cut also into four pieces a pound or less of 
sweet salt pork, and lay them at the bottom of the 
dish. Boil four eggs ten minutes, take out the 
hard yolks, and lay them between the pigeons 
upon the steaks; pour in a gill of gravy or water ; 
cover with puff paste. 

STEWED GIBLETS. 
After very nicely cleaning goose or duck 
giblets, stew them for several hours with a small 
quantity of water, onion, black pepper and a 
bunch of sweet herbs till nearly done; season 
them with salt and pepper and a very small 
piece of mace. Before serving give them one 
boil with a cup of cream and a piece of butter 
rubbed in a teaspoonful of fine flour. 

GIBLET PIE. 
Wash and clean your giblets ; put them in a

butler rolled ia flour ; cover them with water and 
stew till very tender. Line a pie-dish with paste 
and put in the giblets. If the gravy is not thick 
enougli, add a little more butter rolled in flour; 
let it boil once, pour in the gravy, put on a top 
crust, leaving a square hole in the centre. Orna- 
ment the pie with leaves of paste. Set the pie 
in an oven, and when the crust is done take it 
out. 

ROAST HAUNCH OF VENISON. 

To prepare a haunch of venison for roasting, 
wash it slightly in tepid water, and dry it thor- 
oughly by rubbing with a clean, soft cloth. Lay 
over the fat side a large sheet of thickly-buttered 
paper, and next a paste of flour and water about 
three-quarters of an inch thick ; cover this again 
with two or three sheets of stout paper, secure the 
whole well with twine, and lay the haunch to a 
clear, steady fire; baste the paper immediately 
with butter or clarified dripping, and roast the 
joint from three to four hours, according to its 
weight and quality. Doe venison will require 
half an hour less time than buck venison. About 
twenty minutes before the joint is done remove 
the paste and paper, baste the meat in every part 



POULTRY AND GAME. IID 

with butter, and dredge it very lightly with flour; 
let it take a pale brown color, and serve hot, with 
unflavored gravy in a tureen and good current 
jelly. Venison is much better when the deer 
has been killed in the autumn, when wild berries 
are plentiful, and it has had abundant oppor- 
tunities to fatten upon this and other fresh, food. 

BAKED SADDLE OP VENISON. 
In ordering the saddle request the butcher to 
cut the ribs ofif pretty close, as the only part that 
is of much account is the tenderloin and thick 
meat that lies along the backbone up to the neck. 
The ribs which extend from this have very little 
meat on them, but are always sold with the saddle. 
When neatly cut off they leave the saddle in a 
better shape, and the ribs can be put into your 
stock-pot, to boil for soup. Wash the saddle 
carefully. See that no hairs are left, dried on to 
the outside. When ready in the oven cover with 
some buttered white paper, put some boiling water, 
with a little salt, into the bake-pan, set the saddle 
on the rack, and while baking baste often. When 
two-thirds done remove the paper, that the top 
may be nicely browned. Venison should not be 
over-done, and should be eaten hot 



120 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

BROILED STEAKS OP VENISON. 

Heat the gridiron, grease it well, lay on the 
steaks cut from the neck ; broil quickly, without 
scorching, turning them two or three times; 
season with salt and pepper. Have the butter 
melted in a well-heated platter, into which the 
steaks must be laid hot from the gridiron, turn- 
ing them over three times in the butter, and serve 
hot with currant jelly laid on each steak. It is 
well to set the platter into another in which you 
have some boiling water. 

STEWED SHOULDER OF VENISON. 

After carefully removing the bone from the 
shoulder season it with cayenne, salt and pounded 
mace, with a little allspice. Lay over it thin 
slices of the fat of a loin of well-fed mutton; roll 
and bind it tightly ; lay it into a vessel nearly of 
its size, and hardly cover it with some good stock 
made of equal parts of beef and mutton. Stew it 
slowly from three to four hours, according to size 
and weight, and turn it when it is half done. 
Dish, and serve it with some of the gravy in 
which it has been stewed, thickened with rice 
flour, mixed with a glass or more of claret or of 
port wine, and seasoned to taste.

ROAST HARE OR RABBIT, 

A VERY close relationship exists between the 
hare and the rabbit, the chief difference being in 
the smaller size and shorter legs and ears of the 
latter. The manner of dressing and preparing 
each for the table is therefore pretty nearly the 
same. To prepare them for roasting, first skin, 
wash well in cold water and rinse thoroughly in 
lukewarm water. If a little musty from being 
emptied before they were hung up and afterward 
neglected, rub the insides with vinegar and after- 
ward remove all taint of the acid by a thorough 
washing in lukewarm water. After being well 
wiped with a soft cloth put in a filling of force- 
meat, sew the animal up, truss it, and roast for a 
half or three-quarters of an hour, until well 
browned, basting it constantly with butter and 
dredging with flour. Serve with fine red currant 
jelly. 

STEWED RABBIT. 

Cut up a young rabbit and soak it an hour in 

water; lay it in the stew-pan with half a dozen 

mushrooms, a bunch of parsley, a teaspoonful of 

salt, half as much pepper and two blades of mace ; 

pour over a pint of port wine, stew gently for 
11 



122 MRS. portee's new cook-book. 

half an hour. Then take out the rabbit, strain 
the sauce, reduce it a little over the fire, add two 
tablespoonfuls of thick cream, put in the rabbit, 
and heat over the fire, without boiling, for a 
quarter of an hour. Serve in the sauce, with 
sliced lemon. 

CANVAS-BACK DUCK. 

It will generally be conceded that the best 
canvas-back ducks are to be found along the 
Potomac River. Having picked, singed and 
drawn, it well, wipe it carefully, so as to have 
it clean without washing it. Truss it, leaving 
the head on, to show its quality. Place it in a 
moderately hot oven for at least three-quarters 
of an hour ; serve it hot, in its own gravy, on a 
large chafing-dish. Currant jelly should be on 
the table. 

COMMON WILD DUCK. 

These are prepared like canvas-back ducks, 
4xcept the heads are taken off, also the toes, but 
not the feet. They are sometimes skinned, which 
is hardly advisable. To free the fowls from a 
" fishy " taste, first parboil them, with a carrot 



POULTRY AND GAME. 123 

placed inside them, which absorbs the "sedgy" 
taste; chrow it away, and lay the duck in cold 
water for a time. Wild fowls should not be 
stuffed. Flour them well, baste plentifully with 
butter and roast briskly three-quarters of an hour. 
Serve with currant jelly. 

WIDGEON AND TEAL. 

A WIDGEON is a water-fowl of the duck per- 
suasion, as is also the teal, although smaller than 
the common duck. They are dressed precisely 
like the duck, only less time in cooking is required 
for the widgeon, and still less for the teal. 

ROAST PARTRIDGE. 

Pluck, ovnge, draw and truss them ; roast about 
twenty minutes ; baste them well with butter, and 
when the gravy begins to run from them they are 
done. Put them on dishes, three in each dish, 
with some bread-crumbs fried a nice brown and ar- 
ranged in small heaps. The gravy should be served 
in a tureen separately. Orange sauce is a nice 
accompaniment. If these birds have a bitter taste 
when cooked, do not eat them. It is produced by 
their feeding on laurel berries in winter, when 



124 MEs. porter's new cook-book. 

their food is scarce. Laurel berries are poison- 
ous, and people have died from eating birds that 
have fed on them. 

PRIED PARTRIDGE. 

Take a pair of cold partridges that have bee'n 
roasted or broiled ; cut them into quarters and dip 
them into beaten and seasoned yolks of eggs ; put 
some butter into the frying-pan, and when the fat 
becomes very hot drop the birds into it, and cook 
them over a moderately hot fire until nicely 
browned. 

BROILED PARTRIDGE. 

Split them down the back; wash and wipe 
them inside and out with a soft towel; dip them 
into melted butter, then roll them in bread- 
crumbs; repeat this; lay them, inside down, upon 
a well-heated gridiron, turning them once; season 
with a little salt and cayenne; when done serve 
them with piquante sauce. 

STEWED PARTRIDGE. 

Cut them up, after preparing properly; slice 
an onion, pull it in rings and put into the stew- 



POULTRY AND GAME. 125 

pan with a piece of butter rolled in flour and a 
tablespoonful of water, one of wine and another 
of vinegar; boil once, and then put in the par- 
tridge; simmer very gently till done. Garnish 
with slices of toast, and pour the gravy over them. 

BOILED PARTRIDGE. 

Clean and wash them well, cut off the heads 
and truss like boiled fowls; then put them into boil- 
ing water; boil them quickly for fifteen minutes. 
Make a rich sauce by adding an ounce of butter 
to half a pint of thick cream; put in a little salt; 
stir one way over the fire till hot, and pour it into 
a dish with the partridges. Serve immediately. 

POTTED PARTRIDGE. 

Clean them nicely, and season with mace, all- 
spice, white pepper and salt in fine powder ; rub 
every part well, then lay them breast downward 
in a pan, and pack the birds as close as you 
possibly can; put a good deal of butter on them, 
then cover the pan with a coarse flour paste and a 
paper cover. Tie it close, and bake in a slow 
oven for seven or eight hours. Kemove the 

paste, take the bones from the partridges and 
11 • 



126 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

beat them to a proper consistency; put the beaten 
paste into pots and pour butter over. 

PARTRIDGE PIE. 

Prepare and truss them as for boiling; pound 
in a mortar the livers of the birds, a quarter of a 
pound of fat bacon and some shred parsley; lay 
part of this forcemeat at the bottom of a raised 
crust, put in the birds, add the remainder of the 
forcemeat and a few mushrooms; put some slices 
of fat bacon on the top, cover with a lid of crust, 
and bake it two hours and a half. Before serving 
the pie remove the lid, take out the bacon and add 
sufficient rich gravy and orange juice. 

ROAST WOODCOCK. 

Woodcocks should not be drawn, as the trail 
(the intestines) is considered the most delicious 
part of the bird; truss their legs close to the body, 
and run an iron skewer through each thigh close 
to the body, and put them on a small bird-spit feet 
downward; place them to roast at a slow fire; cut 
as many slices of bread as you have birds, toast or 
fry them a delicate brown, and lay them in the 
dripping-pan under the birds to catch the trail ; 



POULTRY AUfD GAME. 12? 

baste them with butter and froth them with flour; 
lay the toast on a hot dish and the birds on 
the toast; pour some good beef gravy into the 
dish, and send some up in a boat; twenty oi 
thirty minutes will roast them. Garnish witL 
slices of lemon. 

Snipes differ little from woodcocks, unless in 
size; they are to be dressed in the same way, 
but require about five minutes less time to roast. 

A good broth may be made of the trimmings and 
parings of the birds used, by stewing them with 
some vegetables and proper seasoning. 

ROASTED LARKS. 
These are considered the most delicate of the 
small birds. When cleaned and prepared for 
roasting, brush them with the yolk of an egg, and 
roll in bread-crumbs ; spit them on a small bird- 
spit, and tie that on a larger spit ; ten or fifteen 
minutes at a quick fire will cook them ; baste tliem 
with fresh butter, and sprinkle them with bread- 
crumbs till they are quite covered, while roasting. 
Sauce, grated bread fried in butter, which set to 
drain before the fire that it may harden. Serve 
the crumbs under the larks when you dish them, 
and garnish them with slices of lemon. 



128 MEs. porter's new cook-book. 

A SALMI OP PHEASANTS OR PARTRIDGES. 
This is a Dice mode of serving the remains of 
roasted game, but when a superlative salmi is de- 
sired, the birds must be scarcely more than half 
roasted for it. In either case, carve them very 
neatly, and strip every particle of skin and fat 
from the legs, wings and breasts ; bruise the bodies 
well, and put them with the skin and other trim- 
mings into a very clean stew-pan. If for a simple 
and inexpensive dinner, merely add to them two 
or three sliced onions, a bay-leaf, a small blade of 
mace and a few peppercorns; then pour in a pint 
or more of good veal gravy, or strong broth, and 
boil it briskly until reduced nearly half; strain the 
gravy, pressing the bones well, to obtain all the 
flavor ; skim off the fat, add a little cayenne and 
lemon juice, heat the game very gradually in it, 
but do not on any account allow it to boil ; place 
pieces of fried bread round a dish, arrange the birds 
in good form in the centre, give the sauce a boil, 
and pour it on them. 





GENERAL REMARKS. 
Vegetables are more healthy and better fla- 
vored when fresh ; the summer varieties, particu- 
larly, should be cooked soon after being gathered, 
as much of their delicately-fine flavor becomes lost 
if they are the least withered. If purchased at 
the markets or of the provision-dealers, they should 
be washed and allowed to soak for some time in 
cold water before cooking. To destroy the small 
snails and other insects which cluster in the leaves 
of cabbage, cauliflower, lettuce and similar plants, 
put them in a pan of strong brine, with the stalk 
ends uppermost, and in about twenty or thirty 
minutes the insects will fall out and sink to the 
bottom. A pound and a half of salt to the gal- 
lon of water will answer for this purpose, and if 
strained daily it will last for some time. When 
the vegetables are properly prepared for cooking, 
boil them quickly in hot water until they are suf-

ficiently tender, probing them with a fork to ascer- 
tain this, and if quite done dish them immediately, 
draining them well through a colander, tak- 
ing care that they do not become broken. In 
cooking vegetables too much salt must not be 
used, as it renders them hard and is apt to impair 
their taste. Half-cooked vegetables are exceed- 
ingly indigestible and unwholesome, and those 
who regard health as of the first importance will 
very sensibly prefer to have them thoroughly 
cooked. 

EOAST POTATOES. 

Select the largest and finest potatoes for roast- 
ing. Wash them thoroughly and put them in a 
stove or oven with their skins on. Let them 
roast about two hours, turning them with a fork. 
When well done, send them to the table hot in 
their skins. Sweet potatoes are roasted in the 
same manner, but require a little longer time to 
be well done. To roast potatoes with beef, poultry 
and other meats, peel the potatoes, and when the 
meat is nearly roasted lay the potatoes in the pan 
and cook them in the gravy. It is generally cus- 
tomary to roast both varieties of the potatoes in 
the same dish. 



VEGETABLES. 131 

STEAMED POTATOES. 

Put them, clean washed, with their skios ou, 
into a steam sauce-pan, and let the water under 
them be about half boiling; let them continue to 
boil rather quickly till they are done. If the 
water once relaxes from its heat, the excellence 
of the potato is sure to be affected, and to become 
soddened, be the quality ever so good. A too pre- 
cipitate boiling is equally disadvantageous, as the 
higher part of the surface of the root begins to 
crack and open, while the centre part continues 
unheated and undecomposed. When cooked suf- 
ficiently tender, dish them, throw over a clean 
napkin and send to the table immediately. 

BOILED POTATOES, IRISH METHOD. 

Wash the potatoes well, leaving the skins on, 
and put them into boiling water. As soon as they 
are boiled sufficiently tender to allow a fork to 
penetrate easily, pour some cold water into the 
pan; let the potatoes remain two or three minutes, 
and then pour off the water. Half remove the 
lid of the pot, and let the potatoes remain over a 
slow fire until the steam is evaporated; then peel 
and send to the table in an open dish. 



132 MRS. pouter's new cook-book. 

STEWED POTATOES. 

Potatoes are unquestionably more nutritiousi 
jnd delicious to the taste when cooked raw. Cold 
potatoes re-cooked become hard, tough and indi- 
gestible. The experienced and thrifty housewife, 
however, suffering nothing to be lost, and with the 
aid of proper seasoning and flavoring, will know 
how to prepare the scraps of potatoes, as well as those 
of other vegetables, which remain after each meal, 
imparting to them an agreeable, savory taste and 
attractive guise well calculated to tempt the most 
delicate and fastidious appetite. 

To stew potatoes, take perfectly sound raw ones; 
divide each potato into four parts, and put them 
into the stew-pan; add salt and pepper, and a piece 
of fresh butter; pour in milk (adding a little cream 
if at hand) just sufficient to keep the potatoes from 
burning. Place the lid on the sauce-pan, and al- 
low the potatoes to stew until soft and tender 
throughout. Stewed potatoes should always be 
thoroughly cooked; if otherwise, they are tough 
and unpalatable. 

To stew potatoes that have been either boiled 
or steamed, cut them into thin slices, season well 
and dredge them with flour; put them into a 
8tew-pan with some fresh butter or olive oil. Fry 



VEGETABLES. 133 

them slightly on both sides for five minutes, drain 
off the fat, pour upon them half a pint of good 
gravy, nicely flavored, and let them stew by the 
side of the fire twenty minutes. Serve with the 
sauce in which they were cooked. 



PRIED POTATOES. 

Boil some nice, large potatoes; set them aside 
a few minutes, and when sufficiently cold slice 
them; sprinkle over them pepper and salt, fry 
them in butter or fresh lard until both sides are 
of a light brown. 

Another way is to mash the potatoes immedi- 
ately after boiling, seasoning with cayenne and 
salt and some finely-chopped ham; make them 
into small cakes, dip them in egg sauce ready 
prepared, and fry both sides a nice brown. 

To fry cold boiled potatoes, grate them and 
season with pepper and salt; beat some eggs very 
light, mix well with the potatoes, and fry them in 
butter. 

MASHED POTATOES. 

After boiling some fine raw potatoes, pare 
them and mash fine, adding a mixture of butter, 
u 



134 MRS. pouter's new cook-book. 

rich milk or cream, and some salt. Sprinkle pep- 
per over the top, and serve while hot. 

Another method is to prepare them as above, 
I)lacing them in a dish, smoothing them on the 
top, and spreading over the beaten yolk of an egg. 
Place them in an oven, and cook until they are of 
a light brown. 

POTATO FRITTERS. 

Boil three or four large potatoes and mash 
them fine. Beat up four yolks and three whites 
of eggs, adding one large spoonful of cream, 
another of sweet wine, a little lemon juice and 
powdered nutmeg. Beat together this batter un- 
til very light, dip the potatoes into it, and then 
place them upon the griddle and fry until nicely 
browned. 

POTATO SALAD. 

Boil three or four nice potatoes, cut them up 
into small pieces and pass them through a sieve. 
Have ready a dressing made as follows : One spoon- 
ful of mustard, two spoonfuls of salt, three spoon- 
fuls of sweet oil, one spoonful of vinegar, the 
yolks of two hard-boiled eggs, one small onion 



VEGETABLES. 135 

chopped fine and one teaspoonfiil of anchovy 
sauce. Mix the whole well with the potatoes, and 
garnish with parsley and hard-boiled egg sliced. 

BOILED CABBAGE. 

To destroy any insects that may lie concealed 
in the cabbage, follow the plan suggested in the 
General Remarks on Vegetables; after which 
Btrip off the loose or faded leaves, and wash well; 
then split in two, or if very large into four, pieces, 
and put it into boiling water with some salt; let it 
boil slowly, skimming it carefully. "When done, 
strain it through a colander. Place it in a vege- 
table-dish, lay inside, among the leaves, some bits 
of cold fresh butter ; season with pepper, and serve 
while hot. 

Cauliflowers are cooked in a similar manner. 

COLD AND HOT SLAWS. 

To make cold-slaw, take a nice, fresh cabbage^ 
wash and strain it (after submitting it to the in- 
sect-destroying process) ; cut off the stalk, shave 
down the head into very small strips with a cab- 
bage-cutter or very sharp knife. It must be done 
evenly. Put it into a deep china-dish and pre- 



136 MKs. poeter's new cook-book. 

pare for it the following dressing: Melt in a 
sauce-pan a quarter of a pound of butter, with 
half pint of water, a large tablespoonful of vine- 
gar, a saltspoonful of salt and a little cayenne. 
Give this a boil, and pour it hot on the cabbage. 
Send to the table cold. 

To prepare warm-slaw, cut the cabbage as for 
cold-slaw (red cabbage is best) ; put it in a deep 
dish, cover closely, and set it on the top of the 
stove for half an hour or till warm all through ; 
do not let it boil. Then make a dripping as for 
cold-slaw. Boil this mixture in a sauce-pan, and 
pour it hot over the warm cabbage ; send to table 
immediately. 

DRESSED SALAD. 

Take tender lettuce leaves, carefully wash and 
half blanch, cutting them slightly. Make a dress- 
ing of the yolk of hard-boiled eggs, mixed mus- 
tard, pepper, butter and vinegar. Boil two or 
three eggs more than are needed for the sauce; 
slice the whites and yolk together ; lay them on 
the lettuce. Then pour the sauce over the whole. 
Beet-ropts, baked or boiled, blanched endive, 
celery, with any ready vegetable, will supply 
salads through the winter. 



VEGETABLES. 137 

CHICKEN SALAD. 
Select one or two nice, fresh lettuces; pick, 
wash, drain, cut them small, and spread them 
evenly on a large, deep dish. Having ready a 
pair of cold fowls, skin them, take away the fat, 
and cut up as if for eating. Cut all the flesh 
from the bones and mince it ; mix with a little 
grated smoked tongue or cold ham. Place the 
minced chicken and grated tongue in the centre 
of the dish containing the lettuce. For the dress- 
ing, mix together the following ingredients, in the 
proportions of the yolks of four eggs well beaten, 
a teaspoon ful of powdered white sugar, a salt- 
spoonful of cayenne, two spoonfuls of made mus- 
tard, six tablespoonfuls of salad oil and five of 
vinegar; stir this mixture well ; put it into a small 
sauce-pan, set it over the fire, and let it boil ex- 
actly three minutes, stirring all the time. Then set 
it to cool. When quite cold, cover with it thickly 
the heap of chicken in the centre of the salad. 
Ornament it with half a dozen or more hard- 
boiled eggs, which, after the shells are removed, 
must be thrown directly into a pan of cold water, 
to prevent them from turning blue. Cut each 
egg lengthways, the white and yolk together, into 
four long pieces of equal size and shape; lay the 

12* 



138 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

pieces upon the salad all round the heap of chicken 
and close to it, placing them so as to follow each 
other in a slanting direction, something in the 
form of a circular wreath of leaves. Arrange in 
a circle upon the lettuce, outside of the circle of 
cut egg, some very red cold beet cut into small 
cones or points, all of equal size. In helping 
those at table, give a portion of everything to 
each person, and it can be mixed together on the 
plate. The salad should be eaten entirely cold, 
tut standing too long will injure it. 

LOBSTER SALAD. 

Prepare a sauce with the coral of a fine, new 
lobster boiled fresh for about half an hour. 
Pound and rub it smooth, and mix very gradually 
with a dressing made from the yolks of two hard- 
boiled eggs, a tablespoonful of English mustard, 
three of salad oil, two of vinegar, one of white 
})Owdered sugar, a small teaspoonful of salt, as 
much black pepper, a pinch of cayenne and two 
fresh yolks of eggs. Next fill your salad bowl 
with some shred lettuce, the better part of two^ 
leaving the small curled centres to garnish your 
dish with. Mingle with this the fiesh of yout 



VEGETABLES. . 139 

lobster, torn, broken or cut into bits. Pour your 
sauce over the whole, put your lettuce hearts do wo 
the centre, and arrange upon the sides slices o'' 
liard-boiled eggs. 

SPINACH. 

It must be carefully picked and washed in sev- 
eral waters, to prevent its being gritty. After 
draining in a colander, put it into a large sauce- 
pan, with only the water that adheres to it. Let 
it simmer slowly for about an hour; then drain 
and dish it. Spread over the spinach a lump of 
butter, and season with pepper and salt. Slice a 
couple of hard-boiled eggs, and place the pieces 
over the top. Serve hot. 

ASPARAGUS. 

ScEAPE the stems of the asparagus lightly, but 
very clean, throw them into cold water, and when 
all are scraped and very clean, tie them in bunches 
of equal size ; cut the large ends evenly, that the 
stems may be all of the same length, and put the as- 
paragus into plenty of boiling water, with a little 
salt. While it is boiling cut two slices of bread

a delicate brown on both sides. When the stalka 
of the asparagus are tender, lift it out directly, or 
it will lose both its color and its flavor, and will 
also be liable to break; dip the toast quickly into 
the liquor in which it was boiled, and dish the 
vegetable upon it, with the points meeting in the 
centre. Pour over rich melted butter, and send to 
table hot. 

STEWED GREEN PUMPE^N. 

Take a large pumpkin, not too old, cut it in 
half and take out the seeds; then cut the pumpkin 
into thin slices, pare them, and put them into a 
pot with just water enough to prevent them from 
burning; slice a small onion, and stew with the 
pumpkin. When quite tender throughout, take 
them up, and drain, wash and press them through 
a colander ; season with black pepper. Prepared in 
this way, stewed pumpkin is very nice when eaten 
with boiled corned beef or corned pork. 

STEWED OYMLINGS OR SQUASHES. 

After carefully selecting squashes that are not 
too old or beginning to harden, wash them, cut 
into slices, remove the seed, and stew them three- 



VEGETABLES. 141 

quarters of an hour or until quite tender. Take 
them up, drain and press out the water thoroughly. 
Mash them with a little fresh butter, pepper and 
salt. Then put them into the stew-pan, set it on 
hot coals, and stir till the squashes become dry. 
Be careful not to burn them. 

STEWED EGa PLANT. 

Purple egg plants are better than the white. 
Put them whole into a pot with plenty of water; 
let them simmer till quite tender. Take them 
out, drain, peel and mash them smooth in a deep 
dish. Mix them with grated bread-crumbs, 
powdered sweet marjoram, a large piece of butter, 
and a few pounded cloves. Grate a layer of bread- 
crumbs over the top, put in an oven and brown ; 
send to table on the same dish. 

PRIED EGG PLANT. 

Do not pare the plant; slice it half an inch thick, 
and lay the slices an hour or two in salt water, 
Take them out, wipe them, and season with peppei 
and salt. Beat up some yolk of egg, and in 
another dish grate some bread-crumbs. Have 
some lard and butter boiling hot in a frying-pan. 



142 MRS. PORTERS NEW COOK-BOOK. 

Dip the slices first in the egg and then in the 
bread-crumbs till both sides are covered; fry them 
brown, being careful to have them well cooked 
throughout. 

PARSNIPS. 

Scrape off the outside, wash and boil them in 
a little salt and water. When done they may be 
dressed with butter and a little pepper, or drawn 
butter, if desired. They are very nice when fried. 
After they are boiled, split open the largest ones, 
season with pepper and salt, dredge a little flour 
over them, and fry them a light brown. Another 
method is to prepare them the same as above, and 
let them boil till very tender, after which, press 
them through a colander, then mash them very 
fine, and season with butter, pepper and salt. 

BEETS. 

Select small-sized, smooth roots. They should 
be carefully washed, but not cut before boiling, 
as the juice will escape and the sweetness of the 
vegetable be impaired, leaving it white and hard. 
Boil them until tender in clear water; do nof 
probe them, but press them with the finger, to as 



VEGETABLES. 143 

certain if tliey are sufficiently done. When satis- 
fied of this, take them up and put them into ii pan 
of cold water, and slip off the outside. Cut them 
into thin slices, and while hot season with butter, 
salt, a little pepper and very sharp vinegar. To 
bake beets, boil and peel them, slice them thin, 
and put them into a baking-dish, forming a layer 
of sliced beets and a layer of grated bread-crumbs; 
make a gravy of butter, pepper and salt and pour 
over them. Bake ten or fifteen minutes. Dish 
them, and send to table. 

TURNIPS. 

Turnips should be pared, cut into thin slices, 
and put into a plenty of boiling water, with a 
lump of salt and a small quantity of dripping. 
Boil them very fast. In a quarter of an hour 
take them up, drain them in a colander, and pour 
melted butter over them; garnish the top of each 
with a spot of black pepper. If the turnips are 
to be mashed, they must be boiled exceedingly 
tender and well drained; mash them with a 
wooden spoon, turn them into a basin, add a little 
milk, cover the basin, heat them in the oven, turn 
them into a warm dish, and serve them hot.

INDIAN CORN. 

Select full-grown but young and tender ears 
If young, the grains will be soft and milky. The 
corn is mucb sweeter and more nutritious when 
cooked with the leaves or husks on, although a 
longer time is required. Kemove only the out- 
side leaves, and carefully take out the silk; put 
the corn into a pot of fast-boiling water; when 
done, take up, drain and place in a covered dish, 
or cover them with a napkin, and serve up hot. 
Just before eating, rub each ear with salt and 
pepper, and then spread over some butter. Corn 
is unquestionably sweeter when eaten off the cob. 
But fastidious people, before company, dislike to 
be seen holding an ear of corn with their hands 
and biting off the grains with their teeth. For 
this reason it is perhaps more frequently cut off 
the cob into a dish and mixed with salt, pepper 
and butter. 

SUCCOTASH. 

Take one dozen ears of nice, tender corn, cut 
off the grains from the cob, and mix with them 
one quart of lima beans. After boiling them well 
in salf and water, drain them through a colander 



VEGETABLES. 145 

and place them at once into a pan, covering to keep 
them hot. Have ready two eggs well beaten, with 
two ounces of butter; pour this mixture over the 
corn and beans, adding pepper and salt to taste; 
serve hot. 

MOCK OYSTERS OF CORN. 

Take one dozen and a half of young corn and 
grate off the grains as fine as possible; mix with 
the grated corn three large tablespoonfuls of sifted 
flour, the yolks of six eggs weH beaten, two table- 
spoonfuls of melted butter and a little pepper and 
salt. Have ready in a frying-pan equal portions 
of lard and butter boiling hot. Put a dessert- 
spoonful of the mixture at a time into the pan and 
fry to a light brown, making each as near the size 
of an oyster as possible. They must be half an 
inch thick. Send to table hot. 

HOMINY. 

After washing and soaking the hominy over 
night, early the next morning put it on to cook, 
in plenty of water, with a little salt; it absorbs, 
like rice, much water, and must be cooked with 
care, and be perfectly white and soft. When quite

done, stir in some new milk and butter, and let it 
stew for ten minutes ; serve hot. It is very nice 
fried for breakfast, and is a necessary accompani- 
ment to pork. 



STEWED TOMATOES. 

Select large, sound and tborougbly ripe toma- 
toes; scald them in hot water, and when suffi- 
ciently cool remove the skins; drain and put them 
into a stew-pan. An iron pot lined with block 
tin is the most suitable, but by all means avoid 
using a copper vessel, as the acid in the tomatoes 
will render it poisonous, especially if the enamel 
is a little worn off. When the stew-pan is nearly 
filled with the tomatoes, add one or two boiled 
onions minced fine and some powdered white 
sugar, to lessen the extreme acrid taste; add also 
a piece of fresh butter dredged with flour, and a 
little salt and pepper. Then put in some bread- 
crumbs, and stew for at least three hours. Toma- 
toes require a long cooking, otherwise they will 
have a raw, acrid taste. The cooking should be 
commenced at least three hours before dinner. 
The juice of the tomatoes is sufficient without any 
water. Send to the table hot. 



VEGETABLES. 147 

TOMATOES BAKED WHOLE. 

Take one dozen large ripe tomatoes, peel them, 
cut slits in the sides, and stuff them with a mix- 
ture of bread-crumbs, yolk of egg, pepper, sail 
and butter. Place them in shallow baking-dishes 
and bake them till done. Pour a little drawn 
butter over them, and serve hot. 

BROILED TOMATOES. 

Wash and wipe the tomatoes, put them on a 
gridiron over live coals, with the stem part down ; 
when that side is done, turn them and let them 
cook through. Place them on a hot dish and 
send to the table quickly, to be there seasoned 
to taste. 

RAW TOMATOES. 

Select large and fully ripe tomatoes, remove 
the skins without scalding, and slice them. Make 
a dressing of half a cup of cider vinegar, one 
tablesj)oonful of mixed mustard, one tablespoonful 
of salad oil, with a little pepper and salt, and pour 
over the tomatoes. Another method of dressing 
raw tomatoes is as follows : After peeling and sli- 
cing them put them in a glass dish, and make a 



148 Mes. pokter's new cook-book:. 

sauce with one gill of wine, half cup of white 
sugar, quarter of a cup of cream and some grated 
nutmeg. Pour this over the tomatoes. 



STEWED ONIONS. 

Peel off the outer skin, trim the ends, and ar- 
range the onions in a sauce-pan of sufficient size 
to contain them all in one layer; just cover them 
with good beef or veal gravy, and stew them very 
gently for a couple of hours; they should be 
tender throughout, but should not be allowed to 
fall to pieces. Send to table hot. The savor of 
this dish is heightened by flouring lightly, and 
frying the onions of a pale brown before stewing. 

BOILED ONIONS. 

Peel and wash the onions, and lay them in a 
broad-bottomed pan or kettle, so that the onions 
may not be piled one upon the other. Cover them 
with milk and water, and let them simmer slowly 
until done. 

FRIED ONIONS. 

Peel and slice them evenly, and fry them in a 
iftn of hot butter till slightly browned. 



VEGETABLES. 149 

STEWED CUCUMBERS. 

Slice them thick, or halve, and divide theia in 
two lengths; strew over some sliced onions; add 
salt and pepper, a little butter, and dredge in a little 
flour. Simmer slowly until done, and serve them 
up hot, at breakfast, or as a side-dish at dinner. 

FRIED CUCUMBERS. 

Peel them, and cut them lengthways, and in 
slices about as thick as a silver dollar. Dry them 
on a cloth, season with pepper and salt, and 
sprinkle them thick with flour. Put some butter 
into a frying-pan; when it boils, put in the slices 
Qf cucumbers, and fry a light brown ; serve hot. 

DRESSED CUCUMBERS. 

After paring and slicing them very thin 
sprinkle some fine salt over them, and let them 
stand for a few minutes; then drain off the water; 
add more salt and some pepper, with two or three 
tablespoon fuls of the purest salad oil; turn the 
cucumbers well, that the whole may receive a 
portion of the seasoning. Then pour over them 
very strong vinegar; transfer into a clean dish, 
and serve.

STEWED MUSHROOMS. 

-, Bemove the skins and ends of the stalks, wash 
them very clean, and place them in a sauce-pan 
without water except what adheres to them. 
Season with pepper, salt and a piece of butter. 
Dredge over them a little flour. Cook slowly 
over the fire, stirring them often. Send to the 
table hot. The best mushrooms grow on uplands, 
or in high, open fields, where the air is pure. 

BAKED BEANS. 

Having soaked the beans over night in soft 
water, in the morning parboil them, adding salt 
to suit the taste. Then place them in a pan and 
Bet in the oven to bake, putting in" a piece of good 
sweet butter : the size of a butternut will answer. 
Bake until tender and nicely browned over on top. 
Beans are very nutritious, and cooked in this v/ay 
are palatable, digestible, and can be eaten by any 
one. It is a very common custom to cook them 
with a chunk of fat pork. The grease bakes out 
into the beans, making a most unwholesome and 
indigestible mess, destroying all the good flavor of 
the beans. If you want the pork, cook it in a dish 
by itself.

BOILED BEANS. 

Soak over night any small white beans in soft 
water, put them in a strong bag, leaving room to 
swell; let them boil in a potful of water until 
done; hang them up, to let all the water drain 
off, and season with butter, pepper and salt to the 
taste. 

BOILED GREEN PEAS. 

Wash and drain the peas, which should be 
young and freshly shelled; put them into plenty 
of fast-boiling, salted water; when quite tender, 
drain them well, dish them quickly and serve very 
hot, with good melted butter, in a tureen. 

BOILED RICE. 

Pick the rice, and wash it thoroughly in cold 
water; after the second washing do not drain oif 
the water till you are ready to put the rice on to 
cook. Prepare a sauce-pan of water with a little 
salt in it, and when it boils sprinkle in the rice. 
Boil it hard for twenty minutes, keeping the pan 
covered. Then take it from the fire and drain oft' 
the water. Afterward set the sauce-pan aside,

stiff; cut it in slices two inches thick, and fry in 
butter until it is of a nice brown.

GENERAL REMARKS. 

In making a good sauce but little merit can be 
claimed when the housekeeper or cook has pkiity 
of good and proper materials on hand ; but it is 
when a fine flavor has been produced from au in- 
adequate supply that praise is justly due; aa, for 
instance, giving a rich flavor of meat to a mess 
of potatoes or some other plain dish when no 
meat has been employed. But to do this it is 
necessary to know the qualities of the various 
vegetables, and how these may be made to re- 
semble the juice of animal food. The vegetable 
products of which by far the most can be made 
by a skillful housekeeper are onions, mushrooms 
and carrots, which may be dressed so exquisitely 
as hardly to be distinguished from the gravy of 
beef. 

Gravies should always be well adapted in flavor 

to the dishes they are to accompany. For some, 

us 



154 MES. porter's new cook-book. 

a high degree of savor is desirable, but for deli- 
cate white meats this should be avoided, and a 
soft, smooth sauce of refined flavor be used. The 
bones of undressed meats will supply almost as 
good gravy stock as the meat itself, if well boiled 
down. Vermicelli or rasped cocoa-nut, lightly 
and very gently, browned in a small quantity of 
butter, will both thicken and enrich gravies, if 
about an ounce of either of them to the pint of 
gravy be stewed gently in it half an hour to an 
hour, and then strained out. Too much thicken- 
ing should be avoided. Before sending gravies to 
table see that they are all well skimmed ; no 
particle of fat should ever be perceptible upon 
them. 

FISH SAUCE, TO KEEP A YEAR. 

Chop twenty-four anchovies, bones and all, ten 
shalots (a species of small onion or garlic), a 
handful of scraped horse-radish, four blades of 
mace, one quart of white wine, one pint of ai - 
chovy liqu/)r, one pint of claret, twelve clovfcs 
and twelve peppercorns ; boil them together until 
reduced to a quart; strain and bottle for use. 
Two spoonfuls will be sufficient for a pound of 
butter.

SHRIMP SAUCE. 
Wash a half p nt of shrimps clean, put them 
into salted boiling water; when cold, cut off the 
})eads and peel off the shells. Then place them 
in a stew-pan with a spoonful of anchovy liquor, 
and thicken some good drawn butter with the 
shrimps; boil up the whole five minutes, and 
squeeze in half a lemon. Shrimp sauce is (ruten 
with salmon and other fine fish. 

OYSTER SAUCE. 

Scald a pint of oysters and strain them throi.gh 
a sieve; then wash some more in cold water, and 
take off their beards; put them in a stew-pan and 
pour the liquor over them ; then add half a lemon, 
two blades of mace, and thicken it with good but- 
ter rolled in flour. Put in some more butter, boil 
it till it is melted ; take out the mace and lemon, 
and squeeze the lemon-juice into the sauce ; boil 
it, and stir it all the time. Put into a boat and 
simmer. For fish, add a large spoonful of an- 
chovy liquor. 

If your oysters are salt, and you can get no others, 
boil a pint of milk instead of the oyster liquor, 
seasoning with powdered nutmeg and mace, and 
enriching it with fresh butter dredged with flour 



156 Mus. poktee's new cook-book. 

CAPER SAUCE. 
Take two large spoonfuls of capers and a little 
vinegar, stir them in a half pint of melted butter. 
This sauce is for boiled mutton. If you have no 
capers, pickled cucumbers chopped fine, or pickled 
radish pods or nasturtions, may be stirred in the 
butter as a substitute. 

EGG SAUCE. 

Boil four eggs a quarter of an hour ; dip them 
in cold water to prevent them looking blue ; peel 
off the shell, chop all the yolks and the whites 
of two; stir them in melted butter. Serve with 
boiled fish or poultry. 

CELERY SAUCE. 

Wash a bundle of parsley in cold water. Then 
boil it six or seven minutes in salt water, drain, 
cut the leaves from the stalks, and chop them fine. 
Have ready some melted butter and stir in the 
parsley. Allow two small tablespoonfuls of leaves 
to half pint of butter. Serve with boiled fowls, 
rock fish, sea bass, and other boiled fresh fish. 
Also with knuckle of veal and calf's head boile'-

APPLE SAUCE. 
Pare, core and slice some nice, juicy apples 
that are not too sweet; put them in a stew-pan 
witli some lemon-peel, grated, and water enough 
ro keep them from burning. Stew them till soft 
and tender, mash them to a paste, and sweeten 
well with brown sugar, adding a little butter and 
some nutmeg. To be eaten with roast pork, roast 
goose or roast duck. 

PEACH SAUCE. 

Take a quart of dried peaches (the richest are 
those with the skins on), soak them in cold water 
till tender ; then drain and put them in a covered 
pan with very little water. Set them on the coals 
and simmer till entirely dissolved, then mash thorn 
with good brown sugar, and send to the table cold.

ONION SAUCB. 
Select some nice small onions, and boil tbera 
whole in milk, adding a very little salt and pep- 
per, and some butter rolled in flour ; let them boil 
till tender all through, but not till they lose their 
shape. Eat thera with any sort of boiled meat. 

MUSHROOM SAUCB. 

Wash a pint of small button mushrooms, re- 
move the stems and outside skins, stew them 
slowly in veal gravy or milk or cream, adding 
an onion, and seasoning with pepper, salt and a 
little butter rolled in flour. Their flavor will be 
heightened by salting a few the night before, to 
extract the juice. In dressing mushrooms, only 
those of a dull pearl color on the outside and the 
under part tinged with pale pink should be se- 
lected. If there is a poisonous one among them, 
the onion in the sauce will turn black. In such 
case throw the v/liole away. 

VANILLA SAUCB. 

Select a small stick of vanilla, split and breaJi 
it up, and boil in a very little milk till all the 
flavor of the vanilla is extracted ; strain it through

spearmint ; cliop it fine, and mix with it one gill 
of vinegar and a quarter of a pound of sugar. 
This sauce is to be eaten with roast lamb. 

CURRY POWDER. 

To make curry powder, take one ounce of 
ginger, one ounce of mustard, one ounce of pep- 
per, three ounces of coriander seed, three ounces 
of turmeric, half an ounce of cardamoms, one 
quarter ounce of cayenne pepper, one quarter 
ounce of cinnamon, and one quarter ounce of

ten tablespoonfuls of water ; let it stew, and when 
done serve in a dish with venison steak. 



SAUCE FOR WILD FOWL. 

One gill of claret, with as much water, some 
i!;rated bread, three heads of shalots, a little whole 
pepper, mace, grated nutmeg and salt; let it stew 
over the fire, then heat it up w^ith butter, and put 
it under the wild fov/1, which, being a little roasted, 
will afford gravy to mix with the sauce. 

OBLBRT SAUCE. 

Take a large bunch of celery, wash clean and 
pare; cut it very small and boil it softly till 
tender; add half a pint of cream, some mace, 
nutmeg, and a small piece of butter rolled in 
flour ; then boil gently. This is a good sauce for 
roasted or boiled fowls, turkeys, partridges or 
other game. 

WALNUT CATSUP. 

The walnuts should be young, freshly gathered 
and tender. Keep them in salt and water four 
days; then pound them in a marble mortar; 



SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 161 

to every dozen walnuts add a quart of vinegar; 
stir them every day for a week; then press all 
the juice from them through a bag; to every 
quart add one teaspoonful of pounded cloves, one 
of mace, one of grated nutmeg, and a small piece 
of whole pepper. Let the whole boil for about 
thirty minutes, and then bottle it, corking each 
bottle tightly and sealing the corks. 



MUSHROOM CATSUP. 

Take a quarter of a peck of large and freshly- 
sathered mushrooms. Cut off the ends of the 
stems, and place them in a deep pan, sprinkling 
salt over each layer. Let them remain for two 
days. Then put them in a sieve and strain off 
the juice; pour it into your preserving kettle. 
To every pint of the liquor allow one dozen 
cloves, the same of allspice, two or three pieces 
of mace, and half of a small nutmeg grated ; let 
it boil for fifteen minutes; then remove it from 
the fire and let it stand for two or three days. 
Then, through a funnel, pour it gently from the 
sediment into small bottles. Finish with a spoon - 
ful of sweet oil on the top of each. Cork the bot- 
tles tightly and seal the corks.

OYSTER CATSUP. 
Select large salt oysters, wash them in their 
liquor, and pound them in a marble mortar, leav- 
ing out the parts that are hard. To each pint of 
pounded oyster add half a pint of vinegar. Lei 
them boil, and as the scum rises skim it off; to 
every quart of boiled oysters add a teaspoonful 
of beaten pepper, a small teaspoonful of powdered 
mace, and cayenne pepper and salt to taste ; boil 
and strain through a sieve ; when cool, bottle it 
up, filling the bottles full. Dip the cork in melted 
rosin or beeswax. 



TOMATO CATSUP. 

Take ripe tomatoes, scald them and remove 
their skins; let them stand a day covered with 
salt ; strain them thoroughly to remove the seed. 
To every quart of tomatoes add three ounces of 
cloves, two ounces of black pepper, two nutmegs 
and a very little cayenne pepper, with a very 
little salt. Boil the liquor half an hour; let it

SAUCES AND GRAVIES. 163 

MELTED OR DRAWN BUTTER. 
Numerous sauces are made with melted butter. 
If mixed with too much flour and water, and not 
enough of butter, it will be very poor, particularly 
if the water is in too large proportion. To pre- 
pare it properly allow a quarter of a pound of 
nice butter to a heaped tablespoonful of flour. 
Mix the butter and flour thoroughly before it 
goes to the fire. Then add to it four large table- 
spoonfuls of milk or hot water, well mixed in. 
Hold it over the fire in a small saucepan kept for 
the purpose. Take care there is no blaze where 
the saucepan is held. Cover it and shake it over 
the fire till it boils. Then, having skimmed it, 
add three or four hard-boiled eggs chopped small, 
and give it one more boil up. None but the 
freshest and best quality of butter should be used. 
This sauce is usually sent to table with boiled fish 
and boiled poultry, also with boiled mutton, lamb 
and veal. 



GRAVY FOR FOWLS. 

Take half a pound of lean beef — slice and score 
it — and a piece of butter the size of a nutmeg ; 
sprinkle with flour, add a small onion ; then put 



164 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

it all into a stew-pan. Stir it round over the fire 
ten minutes ; then pour into it one pint of boiling 
water; skim it carefully; let it all boil together 
for five minutes ; strain it, and it is ready to 
serve. 

BROWN GRAVY. 

Take a sheep's melt, cut it into slices half an 
inch thick, flour them lightly, and either fry 
them a pale brown, or dissolve a small slice of 
butter in a thick saucepan; lay them in and 
shake them over a moderate fire until they have 
taken sufiicient color; then pour gradually over 
them between a half and three-quarters of a pint 
of boiling water ; add a little seasoning of pepper 
and salt, and stew the gravy very gently for up- 
ward of an hour and a half. Strain, and skim 
off the fat, and it will be ready for the table. 
When it is to accompany ducks or geese, brown 
a minced onion with the melt, and add a ST)rig 
of lemon thvme.

GExNERAL REMARKS. 

The iraportance of this branch of the intelli- 
gent, painstaking housekeeper's duties can scarcely 
be over-estimated. As there is no one article of 
food that enters so largely into our daily fare as 
bread, so no degree of skill in preparing other 
articles can compensate for lack of knowledge in 
the art of making good, palatable and nutritious 
bread. JVIany a case of chronic d}^spepsia is at- 
tributable primarily to the habitual eating of 
heavy, sour or ill-baked bread, and in almost 
every case this is caused by the ignorance or 
negligence of the maker or baker. A little 
earnest attention to the subject will enable any 
one to comprehend the theory, and then ordi- 
nary care in practice will make her familiar with 
the process. To make good bread, the first desid- 
eratum is good flour. Be careful to procure the

best, as it is the worst sort of so-called economy to 
buy an inferior article ; recollect, by the way, that 
dampness will soon spoil the best of flour, hence 
great care must be used to keep it in a dry place. 
Second only to the quality of the flour in import- 
ance is that of the yeast. This should be pure, sweet 
and lively; the yeast of mild home-brewed beer 
is frequently used (this requires no purifying, but 
should be passed through a hair-sieve, first thin- 
ning it with warm milk or water), and below 
will be found some recipes for making excellent 
yeast. Having secured unexceptionable materials, 
the rest of the secret of success lies in two words — 
care and work : care, in mixing the ingredients, 
in keeping the dough from souring, in having the 
oven properly heated when the bread is put into 
it, in baking sufiiciently yet not too much, and in 
handling it while hot to keep it from falling ; and 
work, in kneading it thoroughly. 

GOOD YEAST. 

Boil four good-sized potatoes; mash or sift 
fine ; to this add a half cupful of sugar, two-thirds 
cupful of salt, one quart of boiling water, one pint 
of cold water, one cupful of old yeast; cover the 



HOW TO MAKE BREAD. 167 

mixture closely and let it rise over-night, when it 
will be ready for use. One gill will raise three 
pints of meal. 

UNRIVALED YEAST. 

On one morning boil two ounces of the best 
hops in four quarts of water half an hour ; strain 
it, and let the liquor cool to the consistency of 
new milk ; then put it in an earthen bowl, and 
add a small handful of salt and half a pound of 
brown sugar; beat up one pound of good flour 
with some of the liquor; then mix all well to- 
gether, and let it stand till the third day after ; 
then add three pounds of potatoes, boiled and 
mashed through a colander; let it stand a day, 
then strain and bottle, and it is fit for use. It 
must be stirred frequently while it is making, and 
kept near a fire. One advantage of this yeast is 
its spontaneous fermentation, requiring the help 
of no old yeast ; if care be taken to let it ferment 
well in the bowl, it may immediately be corked 
tightly. Be careful to keep it in a cool place. 
Before using it shake the bottle up well. It will 
■ keep in a cool place two months, and is best the 
latter part of the time. Use about the same quan 
lity as of other yeast.

SUMMER YEAST. 

Boil one pint of hops in one quart of water ; 
Btrain it hot on one pint of flour and one table- 
Bpoonful of salt; stir it well, and cool; half a 
pint of yeast; let it rise; add as much Indian 
meal as will make a stijff dough. E-oll into rolls. 
When they are light, cut them up in thin cakes 
and dry them in the shade, turning them several 
times a day. Keep in a dry place. Use to a 
baking of four two-pound loaves two cakes soaked 
in tepid water an hour. It is portable, and every 
way desirable for warm weather. 

GOOD YEAST. 

Boil a small handful of hops in a quart of 
water. Boil until done five medium-sized pota- 
toes pared. Now make them smooth with one 
and a half pints of flour. Pour in the water 
strained from the hops. Stir this until it is a 
thin batter, adding hot water if too thick. Let 
it stand until little more than milk-warm; then 
add a teacupful of good brewer's yeast. Let it 
stand in a warm place eight or ten hours, when 
add a tablespoonful of salt and two tablespoon sfui 
of white sugar. Mix well ; set it away in a stone 
jar or jug, and it is ready for use.

WHEAT BREAD. 

Carefully sift sufficient flonr for the quantity 
of bread desired. Put into the bread-bowl, to 
every quart of flour, two and a half gills of water, 
a large spoonful of yeast and a teaspoonful of salt ; 
stir well and add a handful from each quart of 
flour ; mix thoroughly, and then combine into it 
about one-third of the flour. The mixture you 
now have is called the sponge. Set the sponge in 
a warm (not hot) place till it becomes very light ; 
then add the remainder of the flour and knead very 
thoroughly. Make into loaves, and let them rise ; 
as soon as they begin to crack on the top they are 
ready for the oven, which should be very warm, 
with tendency to get warmer slowly. A little 
butter or sweet lard improves the bread, besides 
making it keep fresher. 

WHEAT AND MUSH BREAD. 

Spread eight quarts of flour in your bread- 
bowl, so as to leave a large cavity in the centre. 
Make two quarts of sifted white corn meal into 
mush by boiling it in either water or milk, and 
when it becomes cool enough to add the yeast 
without scalding it turn it into the flour ; stir in 

16 



170 MRS. PORTEli'S NEW COOK-BOOK. 

warm milk or water, mixing in a portion of the 
flour and a teacupful of good yeast; cover the 
whole closely, and let it stand over-night. Knead 
il well in the morning, and make it into loaves. 
It will rise soon near the fire. Bake it thoroughly, 
and you will have an excellent article of light, 
sweet and nutritious bread, which will keep moist 
longer than any other and make the flour ''hold 
out" wonderfully. 



GOOD COUNTRY BREAD. 

At noon pare and wash your potatoes for diu' 
ner ; have four or five more than you want to eat. 
When done, drain the boiling water on enough 
flour to. make a stiff batter; mash your extra 
potatoes, and stir in with a teaspoonful of salt 
while hot; when cool have your emptying cake 
soaked soft ; stir in ; let it stand in a warm room 
to rise. Before you go to rest for the night take 
milk (if you have it ; if not, warm water), and mix 
it up hard and let it stand until morning ; knead 
it up again after breakfast ; mould and put in tins, 
and it will soon be ready to bake. Do not burn. 
If you do not have good bread, it is because your 
flour is poor.

WHEAT AND RICE BREAD. 

1. Boil half a pound of rice in three pints of 
water til] the whole becomes thick and pulpy. 
With this, yeast, six pounds of flour and salt to 
taste, make your dough. It is an excellent sum- 
mer bread. 

2. To make a very palatable and wholesome 
loaf of bread, take a pint of boiled rice (not over- 
done) ; masli it and pass it through a sieve ; rub 
with it two tablespoonsful of butter, and pour in a 
pint and a half of milk. Mix well, and add suffi- 
cient sifted flour to make moderately stiff paste, 
and bake brown. 

WHEAT AND WHITE POTATO BREAD. 

Take one pint of new milk, one pint of boiling 
water, and mix with six good-sized potatoes well 
boiled and mashed; stir in a large spoonful of 
salt, the same of sugar, and flour enough to make 
a stiff batter ; set it in a warm place to rise, and 
when it has risen so as to double its first bulk, stir 
in more flour and knead it slightly ; then divide 
it into three loaves, putting them into deep tins, 
and when they have again risen as before, bake in 
a moderate oven. 



172 MEs. poetee's new cook-book. 

WHEAT AND SWEET POTATO BREAD. 

Same as preceding, except that instead of six 
white you use sweet potatoes enough to make about 
a quart of pulp when mashed and passed through 
a sieve. Be careful to boil them just enough to 
mash readily ; if they are soft and watery, they 
will not make good bread. 

BROWN BREAD. 

Take two quarts of corn meal, one quart of rye 
or wheat flour, and mix with one quart of sour 
milk or buttermilk, adding one large spoonful of 
saleratus, two small cupsful of molasses, a little 
salt and enough of water or sweet milk to make a 
thick batter. Bake in a deep dish three hours in 
a hot oven, letting it cool gradually another hour ; 
or, as some prefer, it may be steamed until quite 
done, and then placed just long enough in the 
oven to give it a desirable firmness. 

DYSPEPSIA BREAD.

. GENERAL REMARKS. 
Cake is indeed one of the luxuries of our table, 
yet it might almost claim a place among the neces- 
saries, so universally does it demand at least an 
occasional use even among those of less than moder- 
ate means. Cake, when home-made, costs scarcely 
one-half the store-price; hence, the importance 
of the housekeeper's being thoroughly conversant 
with this branch of Domestic Economy. We can 
but give the outline, the theory : practice alone 
can ensure success ; the most careful, painstaking 
housewife may meet with discouraging results in 
her first attempts, even though she may think she 
is following most exactly the details of the recipe ; 
total failure at the first, resulting in heavy, soggy 
01 doughy cake, should not discourage her, but 
should rather spur her to renewed efforts, witli 
full determination to succeed. " If you don't suc- 
ceed at first, try, try again." In cake making or

baking, more than in any other line of culinary 
work, much indeed depends on the quality of the 
materials used, but far more on care and skill in 
manipulation. Attention to quantity of each in- 
gredient is very necessary, if not absolutely indis- 
pensable, and to be sure of exactness it is necessary 
to have a clear conception of relative weights and 
measures. It is well to ascertain how much cer- 
tain cups and bowls hold, and use them always for 
measuring ingredients. 

Before proceeding to give recipes some general 
instructions applicable to most styles of cake will 
be found useful. Where yeast is used, special care 
must be exercised to have it sweet and free from 
bitterness. One very important fact is often over- 
looked — it is this : the ingredients, such as flour, 
butter, sugar, eggs, etc., should usually all be of a 
uniform temperature, rather warmer than their 
average natural heat. Eggs will beat better near 
a fire ; they should be beaten very long, whites 
and yolks separately ; a wooden bowl and wooden 
beater are preferable to others. Butter should be 
moderately soft, but not melted in the least. If 
only slightly melted, heavy, greasy cake is the 
Bure result. Sugar should be rolled or sifted in a 
warm room before used. Flour or meal sliould 



HOW TO MAKE CAKES. 197 

also be invariably sifted. Currants should be 
thoroughly washed the day before they are 
wanted, and spread thin on tin near the firf, to 
dry ; if damp, they will make cake heavy ; before 
putting them in the cake, dust them well with 
flour and shake them. Raisins should be stoned 
and chopped small. Lemon-peel, almonds, etc., 
should be beaten in a mortar with a few drops of 
wine or water to a smooth paste. All the ingredients 
should be properly prepared before commencing 
to mix any of them. Lemon-juice, vinegar or 
saleratus, when used, should be the last added. 
The moulds or pans (when paper is not used) 
should be well buttered; if the cake sticks, dip 
the pan for an instant in cold water, taking care 
that none gets to the cake itself. The heat of the 
oven should be carefully regulated ; it should be 
just hot enough to raise the cake gently and 
gradually, without too soon hardening or crisping 
the top, but this is a point that can be learned 
only fiom experience. To determine when the 
cake is done, run into it a broom-straw ; if a par- 
ti(?le adheres to it, the cake is not done. 

Cake should never be kept in wooden drawers 
or boxes, but in covered earthen pans or crocks, 
or tin boxes.

tageous to make 

SPONGE CAKE. 

One of the very nicest of cakes (when well 
made), and one of the most difficult to make just 
right ; the absence of butter makes it the more dif- 
ficult to avoid the leathery toughness so often met 
with in what is popularly miscalled Sponge Cake. 
The first of the following recipes is preferable if 
you can get the knack of following it successfully ; 
lluv second will be available if you cannot make 
the first suit you : 



228 MES. poktek's new cook-book:. 

1. Sift half a pound of flour (arrowroot is still 
better) in a shallow pan ; beat twelve eggs till 
very thick, light and smooth ; you need not sepa- 
rate the yolks and whites if you know the true 
way of adding the flour ; beat a pound of powdered 
loaf sugar gradually (a little at a time) into the 
beaten eggs, and add the juice and grated rinds of 
one or two large lemons or oranges ; lastly, stir in 
the flour or arrowroot ; it is highly important that 
this be done slowly and lightly, not stirring to the 
bottom of the pan ; have ready buttered either a 
turban mould or small tins ; put the mixture in, 
grate powdered sugar profusely over the surface 
to give it a gloss like a very thin crust, and set it 
immediately into a brisk oven. The small cakes 
are called Naples biscuits, and require no icing. 
A turban cake may be iced plain, without orna- 
ment. A very light sponge cake, when sliced, 
will cut down rough and coarse-grained, and it is 
desirable to have it so. Be especially careful in 
the baking. 

2. Same as above, except you separate the 
whites and yolks of the eggs, beating the whites 
to a stiff froth ; beat the sugar and lemon with 
the yolks, add the whites and then the flour 
or arrowroot.

LADY FINGERS 
Ake mixed in the same manner and of the 
same ingredients as the best sponge cake. When 
the mixture is finished, form the cakes by shaping 
the batter with a teaspoon upon sheets of soft 
white paper slightly damped, forming them like 
double ovals joined in the centre. Sift powdered 
sugar over them, and bake them in a quich oven 
till slightly brown ; when cool, take them off the 
papers ; they are sometimes iced. 



ALMOND SPONGE CAKE. 

The addition of almonds makes this cake very 
superior to the usual sponge cake. Sift half a 
pound of fine flour or arrowroot; blanch in scald- 
ins: water two ounces of sweet and two ounces of 
bitter almonds, renewing the hot water when ex- 
pedient; when the skins are all off, wash the 
almonds in cold water (mixing the sweet and 
bitter), and wipe them dry; pound them to a 
fine smooth paste (one at a time), adding, as you 
proceed, rose-water, to prevent their oiling ; set 
them in a cool place; beat twelve eggs till very 
smooth and thick, and then beat into them grad- 
ually a pound of powdered loaf sugar in turn 



230 MES. POETEE's IfEW COOK-BOOK. 

with the pounded almonds ; lastly, add the flour, 
stirring it round slowly and lightly on the surface 
of the mixture, as in common sponge cake ; have 
ready buttered a deep square pan ; put the mixture 
carefully into it, set into the oven, and bake till 
thoroughly done and risen very high ; when cool, 
cover it with plain white icing flavored with rose- 
water, or with almond icing. With sweet almonds 
always use a small portion of bitter ; without them, 
sweet almonds have little or no taste, though they 
add to the richness of the cake. 

SPONGE CAKE. 

We add two other methods, said by a com- 
petent lady to produce very fine cake : 

1. Six eggs, same weight of sugar, half weight 
of flour, half a lemon squeezed in, the whole of the 
lemon-skin grated; beat the yellow to a froth, 
then add the sugar; when well beaten, add the 
white (which must be very light), then put in the 
juice and grating, last flour, a teaspoonful of salt. 

2. Five eggs, half a pound of sugar, six ounces 
of flour, leaving out two tablespoonsful ; beat the 
whites of the eggs to a frotli ; add the sugar and 
unbeaten yolks alternately, leaving out one yolk; 
add flour last,

MERINGUE CAKE , 
^f AKE d light sponge cake (of twelve eggs, one 
pound of sugar, one lemon and three-quarters of 
a pound of flour), and divide the batter into three 
parts, and bake in three separate pans ; put a thick 
layer of marmalade or preserves on the top of the 
cake ; take the whites of nine eggs and two pounds 
of best refined powdered white sugar, and beat the 
eggs very light; add the sugar, and beat both 
until they can stand alone ; add a little extract of 
lemon or vanilla to flavor it ; put this on the mar- 
malade cake ; place it in an oven just warm enough 
to dry it (so as to harden it in about ten minutes), 
and let it be a very light brown. 

ROLL CAKE. 

Make a sponge cake in the usual way and 
divide (half) the batter, and bake it in a broad 
square pan ; trim the edges when done, and put 
ou the fruit, and roll it up while it is hot (as you 
would a roll-dumpling), and have your dish in- 
verted and well greased with butter to keep the 
cnke from sticking. These cakes should not be 
iced, but prettily ornamented. The marmalade 
of green apples is the nicest fruit used, as it re- 
tains its color and flavor so well.

APEES (A. P.'S). 
One pound and a half of flour, one pound of 
sugar, one pound of butter, one gill of milk ; rub 
the butter, sugar and flour together; add the 
milk; stir the mixture with a knife or spoon into 
a dough ; turn it out, and work it until it becomes 
perfectly smooth ; roll it into thin sheets, cut with 
a small cutter, place on tins, and bake them in a 
cool oven. It will take a few minutes to knead 
all the ingredients into a dough, but, as the 
quantity of milk is quite suflicient, it would spoil 
them to add more. 



VERY RICH CITRON CAKE. 

One pound each of butter, sugar, flour and 
citron, ten eggs, one scant wineglassful of brandy 
diluted with rose-water, one grated nutmeg ; beat 
the butter, sugar and nutmeg until very light; 
stir in the brandy and one-fourth of the flour ; 
whisk the eggs thoroughly and add alternately 
with the remaining flour, one-third at a time; 
cut the citron thin and into very small pieces and 
stir into the mixture ; beat all well together ; bake 
in a moderate oven. If desired this may be iced 
with lomon-flavored icing.

MERINGUES. 

One pound of sugar, half a pound of butter, one 
pound of flour, tlie yolks of six eggs, one nutmeg, 
half a wineglassful of rose-water ; beat the butter 
and sugar to a cream ; whisk the eggs until they 
become thick; then put the butter, sugar and 
eggs into the flour; lastly, add the nutmeg and 
rose-water; mix the dough well, flour your board, 
and roll it half an inch thick ; cut it into cakes 
and put them into a shallow pan ; do not let them 
touch ; bake five minutes in a quick oven ; when 
cool, lay on each a lump of currant jelly ; then take 
the whites of six eggs and whisk them until they 
become perfectly dry and stifl"; add to them grad- 
ually one pound of powdered sugar, so as to make 
an icing; with a spoon heap on each lump of jelly 
as much of this icing as will cover it ; place the 
cakes in a cool oven until the icing becomes firm 
and of a pale-brown color. 

COLUMBIA CAKE. 
Two cupsful of sugar, two cupsful of flour, sis 
eggs, juice and rind of two lemons, two saltspoons- 
ful of cream of tartar ; four saltspoonsful of soda 
dissolved in two large spoonsful of warm water, to 
be put in at the last ; bake in two loaves.

BURGESS CAKES. 
Half a pound of butter, half a pound of sugar, 
me pound of flour, three eggs, one tablespoonful 
of brandy, one teaspoonful of cinnamon and nut- 
meg mixed, half a pound of currants; beat the 
butter, sugar, spice and brandy until light; whisk 
the eggs thick and add alternately with the flour; 
then stir in the currants ; with a teaspoon put them 
on tins slightly buttered; they should be rather 
larger than macaroon ; bake in a moderate oven. 

ROCK CAKES. 

Thkee-quaeters of a pound of sweet almonds, 
blanched and cut into small pieces, one pound of 
pulverized sugar, the whites of five eggs ; beat the 
whites until very dry, then add the sugar very 
gradually, a teaspoonful at a time; when done, 
stir in the almonds, place the mixture on white 
2)aper with a teaspoon, in conical shapes ; put the 
paper on tins, and bake in a cool oven until they 
can be removed from the paper without breaking. 

SWISS CAKES. 

One pound each of butter and sugar, one pound 
and three-quarters of flour, nine eggs, two table- 

23* 



270 MEs. pobtee's new cook-book. 

spoonsful of rose-water ; beat tlie butter, sugar 
and rose-water until very light; add one-fourth 
of the flour; whisk the eggs until very thick and 
stir in gradually, mixing all well ; add the re- 
mainder of the flour, one-third at a time ; beat all 
well together ; bake in a moderate oven ; when 
cool, ice, and before the icing is dry mark it into 
squares, and again diagonally, with a. knife. 

THE GALETTB. 

This is a favorite in France ; it may bo made 
rich or plain by varying the allowance of butter, 
and by using or omitting egg-yolks. One pound 
of flour and twelve ounces of buttei' rubbed well 
together, salt to taste, the yolks of two or three 
eggs, a small cupful of sweet rich cream, an ounce 
of sifted sugar, if desired ; when thoroughly though 
lightly worked together, roll into a complete round, 
not quite an inch thick, score in small diamonds, 
brush over with egg-yolk, and bake about an hour 
in a tolerably brisk oven. 

JOLLIES. 

Four eggs, half a pound of sugar, four ounces 
each of butter and flour; flavor with lemon or 



HOW TO MAKE CAKES. 271 

orange-peel grated, or with mace and cinnamon to 
taste; bake in small buttered patty-pans about 
fifteen minutes. 



ROCHERS.— EXCEEDINGLY PINE. 

Sev^en ounces of sweet and one of bitter almonds, 
six ounces of candied orange-peel, one ounce of 
citron or green ginger, two ounces of flour, twelve 
ounces of sugar, half a teaspoonful each of mace 
and cinnamon, whites of three large eggs; blanch, 
dry and chop very fine the almonds ; mix with 
the orange-rind and citron (or ginger), and add 
the other ingredients, beating the egg-whites as 
stiff as possible and putting them in last ; roll the 
mixture into balls about a scant inch in diameter, 
and bake on paper about twenty minutes; they 
should be quite crisp, but not highly colored. 

ICING. 

This elegant finish is not difiicult to apply ; it 
is made by beating the whites of eggs to the stifl- 
est froth and sifting into this, little by little, fine 
powdered loaf sugar until it is quite thick ; flavor 
with essence of vanilla, or to taste; lay it on with 
a broad case-knife, and smooth with another knife 



272 MUs. poetek's new cook-book. 

dipped in water; set the iced cake in a cool oven, 
with the door open, or on the hearth under tic 
OTen, to dry. 

If you wish to ornament with figures or flowers, 
make up rather more icing, keep about one-third 
out until that on the cake is dried, then with a 
clean glass syringe apply it in such forms as you 
desire, and dry as before ; what you keep out to 
ornament with may be tinted pink with cochineal 
syrup, blue with indigo, yellow with saffron, green 
with spinach syrup, and brown with chocolate, 
purple with cochineal syrup and indigo. This 
tinting is troublesome, but adds much to the beauty 
of the cake, though not to the quality. 

The icing may be handsomely ornamented, too, 
by putting on, when partially dry, rich-colored, ripe 
fruit, such as strawberries, red currants, etc., or 
small confections (assorted colors). Sweet-scented 
■eaves as well as rose-petals are sometimes used. 

If you desire to give the icing a frosted appear- 
ance all over or in spots, sprinkle it, when it is 
almost dry, very lightly, in very minute sprays, 
with rose-water; or, if you prefer to give it a 
highly polished, glossy appearance all over or in 
spots, dilute a little icing and put on very gently 
when the first coat i& quite dry. 



HOW TO MAKE CAKES 273 

CHOCOLATE ICING. 
One cupful of milk, quarter of a pound of the 
best prepared chocolate, one cupful of powdered 
sugar, one teaspoonful of vanilla ; scald the milk 
and chocolate, then add the sugar, etc. ; pour the 
mixture on the well-beaten white of an egg ; this 
will ice a large cake or pudding. Other kinds 
may be made by substituting lemon, orange, nut- 
meg or any flavor desired. 

ALMOND ICING. 

One pound of sweet almonds, with enough bitter 
to give flavor, and one pound of loaf sugar ; beat 
them until well mixed and very fine ; put in a 
pan with the whites of ten eggs that have been 
previously well beaten ; beat well together with a 
wooden spoon, and lay smoothly on the cake, 
about an Jlnch thick, half an hour before it is 
baked. 

FROSTING. 

Fob the white of one egg take nine heaping 
teaspoonsful of white sugar and one teaspoonful 
of corn-starch ; beat the eggs to a stiff froth, so 
that the plate can be turned upside down without 
the egg falling off; stir in the sugar and the 



274 MHs. poetee's new cook-book. 

starch slowly with a wooden spoon, ten or fifteen 
minutes constantly ; then sift over it fine sugar 
and grated cocoanut or other fruit, if desired, or 
grated nut-kernels; or a few assorted colors of 
small confections add to beauty as well as taste. 
To frost a common-sized cake one and one-half 
eggs will sufiice. 

WHIPPED CREAM. 

A DELIGHTFUL dressing for some sorts of cake 
is made thus: One pint of rich cream, enough fine 
pulverized loaf sugar to thicken ; stir it well ; set 
it on fire till it warms through ; flavor to taste, 
and color if desired ; let it cool and spread on the 
cake. 

SAUCE FOR CAKE. 

One cupful of sweet milk, one egg, one tea- 
spoonful of starch, one tablespoonful of ilour, two 
Lablespoonsful of sugar. 








GENERAL REMARKS. 

ScAECE anything can be more unwholesome 
and deleterious than the tough, rancid or heavy 
compounds so frequently served up under the 
tempting appellations of pies and pudding, and 
yet a little care in the selection of ingredients and 
in their manipulation will secure pastry that will 
prove not only palatable but nutritious. One 
fact must always be borne in mind — that inferior 
ingredients cannot be made into superior com- 
pounds, though the finest ingredients may bo 
ruined by careless or ignorant handling. In the 
making of pies, the preparation of the fruit, etc., 
is but a small part of the work ; the manufacture 
of light, sweet and moderately brittle paste or 
crust is the grand desideratum. Hence, the im- 
portance of attention to the recipes for making 
paste ; even the already proficient pie and pud- 
ding maker will find it no disadvantage to study 



276 MRS. POETEK S NEW COOK-BOOK. 

tliem, and comjDare the processes given with those 
she has hitherto used. 

Before giving specific recipes, it will not be 
amiss to make some suggestions of general ap- 
[>lication : 

1st. The best place to roll paste on is a marble 
slab, and the best shape for the rolling-pin is 
straight, equally thick at ends and centre; avoid 
hard or heavy rolling or kneading. 

2d. Be careful to have all the materials cool — 
the butter and lard hard. 

3d. Put the several ingredients together quickly 
and handle as little as possible ; slow mixing and 
contact with the hands or fingers have a tendency 
to make tough crust. 

4th. Except in puff paste, lard and butter in 
about equal proportions make the best crust ; that 
made of butter alone is almost sure to be tough, 
and of lard alone, though tender, is white and in- 
sipid. Beef drippings or the dripj^ings of fresh 
pork in lieu of butter and lard make a very light 
and palatable crust, lighter and more tender than 
that made with butter alone, much nicer tasted 
than that made with lard alone, and nearly or 
quite equal to that made with butter and lard 
combined ; never use mutton drippings in ei"ust. 



HOW TO MAKE PASTRY. 277 

5tb. Always roll from you ; twice will answer 
for rolling out the paste, but each additional time, 
if rolled lightly, adds to its richness and lightness. 

6th. Use very little salt and very little water ; 
the latter, unless you want tough crust, pour in 
gradually, but a few drops at a time. 

7th. Use plenty of flour on paste-board, to keep 
the paste from sticking. 

8th. Pastry, except "raised" crust, should not 
Btand a minute after prepared before it is placed 
in the oven. 

9th. Special care is requisite with the oven; 
the heat should have a body to it, and the fire be 
looked to lest it desert you ; the oven should be 
quite brisk, but not sufficiently so to scorch the 
paste before it has had time to rise ; if too slack, 
the paste will not rise at all, but look white and 
clammy, while the best paste has a tinge of yel- 
low ; if permitted to scorch or brown, it becomes 
rancid. 

10th. The filling should be perfectly cool when 
put in, or it will make the bottom crust sodden. 

11th. Always carefully sift your flour before 
using it. 

12th. In making juicy pies cut a slit in the top 
to let the steam escape; invert a very small cup 

24 



278 MES. portee's new cook-book. 

on the centre of the pie: the extra juice will be 
drawn under the cup. 

13th. For the best puff pastes, always wash 
your butter; unless very salt, it need not be 
washed for plainer pastes; to make the butter 
liard in warm weather, w^ash it in iced water ; 
then place it between the folds of a towel and put 
it on a large piece of ice ; after remaining an hour, 
turn it over, that it may become equally hard all 
through. 

14th. Use a cool knife in working paste. 

15th. Work the crust for one pie at a time. 

16th. In winter, as soon as the paste is made, 
put it on a dish, cover with a cloth, and set it in a 
cold place until perfectly hard ; by letting it re- 
main two or three hours, it will puff much more 
than if baked soon after mixing. Be careful 
not to let it freeze. In summer, place it between 
the folds of a clean napkin and put it on a large 
flat piece of ice, which first cover with a thick 
cloth to prevent the paste from getting the least 
lamp ; turn over when it gets cold, so as to get it 
cold throughout. 

17th. Always bake pies and puddings in tin 
plates ; the paste bakes more thoroughly. 

18th. To make pastry that will be entirely 



HOW TO MAKE PASTEY. 279 

wholesome, mix one ounce of carbonate of soda 
with seven drachms of tartaric acid. Put into a 
glass jar, with a closely-fitting lid, after having 
incorporated it fully. It is then fit for use, and 
pie-crust should not be made without it ; use a 
teaspoon ful to every two pounds of flour. 

Almost every sort of pastry is better eaten 
fresh ; if not eaten when just out of the oven, it 
should be warmed before served ; it is more palat- 
able, as well as more wholesome, warm ; a very rich 
crust, especially that of mince pies, will keep good 
two or three weeks. 

PLAIN FAMILY PASTE. 

Two pounds of flour, half a pound each of but- 
ter and lard; work well, but lightly. Or, as some 
will prefer, take twelve ounces of butter and four 
of lard ; this makes a very agreeable crust. The 
amount of shortening may be doubled, if desired, 
or drippings (see 5th, under General Remarks'! 
may be substituted for butter and lard. 

RAISED CRUST FOR PIBS. 

One pound of flour, three ounces of butter, 
tablespoonful of good lively yeast, milk to form 



280 MRS. poeter's new cook-book. 

a dough ; rub the butter in the flour, add the 
milk and yeast, and set it aside to rise; when 
light, roll it out thin, and line your plates ; j)ut in 
the' fruit, roll out the cover, place it over and set 
the pies in a quick oven. This is very nice for 
those who cannot eat rich paste. 



A GOOD PASTE FOR DUMPLINGS. 

To one pound of flour add a little salt and as 
much boiling water as will make it into a stiff 
dough ; flour your pie-board, turn the dough out 
and work it lightly, then take a piece, roll it thin, 
and it is ready for the fruit. Dumplings covered 
with paste made in this way should always be 
boiled in cloths or nets, and will be found much 
more digestible than when made in the usual 
oianner. 

A PLAIN CRUST. 

One bowlful of lard, one bowlful (scant) of 
water, three bowlsful of flour ; mix all well together, 
and roll out, using "patent flour" (if convenient). 
In the preparation of puddings baked in crust, the 
under part of the crust can be made by this method, 
and half a pound of richer paste used as an edge. 



HOW TO MAKE PASTKY. 281 

POTATO PASTE. 
Boil three moderate-sized potatoes till very 
soft; peel and mash them fine and smooth; put 
into a deep pan and mix well with a quart of flour 
and half a pint of lard, or with half a pint of beef 
dripping or the dripping of fresh roast pork. 
Having mixed the mashed potatoes, dripping and 
flour into a lump, roll it out into a thick sheet ; 
sprinkle it with flour, and spread over it evenly a 
thin layer of dripping or lard ; fold it again, and 
set it in a cool place till wanted. It is good for 
meat pies and for boiled meat pudding, or any sort 
of dumplings. 



GOOD, NOT EICH, PASTES. 

Very good crust for every-day family pies may 
be made by wetting up the flour with sour milk or 
cream sweetened with saleratus ; a little butter may 
be used, if desired, although the crust will be more 
light without it Light wheat dough, with a little 
butter worked in, makes healthful upper crust for 
pies. Very plain paste may be made by using a 
quarter of a pound of lard to every pound of flour. 
This, to be sure, will not be rich, but with a bit 
of dissolved sal- volatile and a skillful hand will 

24 » 



282 MES. pokter's new cook-book. 

produce quite as palatable and more healthful an 
article than that which is so often made of oily or 
rancid butter. 

PUFF PASTE. 

Three-quarters of a pound of butter to three- 
quarters of a pound of flour; divide the butter 
into five or six equal parts ; cut up two of these 
parts into the sifted flour in very thin slices ; 
pour in a very little water at once, and stir with a 
knife ; when it is stiff turn it out upon the board, 
roll it gently with the pin, dust on flour, roll it 
up ; repeat this till you have mixed in the remain- 
ing pieces of butter ; then roll it up, and it is ready 
for use ; if these directions are carefully followed, 
and it is not spoiled in baking, it will rise to a nice 
thickness and appear in flakes and leaves, accord- 
ing to the number of times it is rolled out. 

FINE PUFF PASTE. 

Three-quarters of a pound of butter with a 
pound or quart of flour ; dissolve a lump of sal- 
volatile (easily obtained at the druggist's) in a 
little cold water ; divide the butter into four parts ; 
rub one part into the flour, wet it up with a little 
cold water, adding the salts ; next dredge the board 



HOW TO MAKE PASTRY. 283 

thick with flour, put upon it a second portion of 
tlie butter in very thin slices, dredge again thick 
with flour, roll it out once and lay it aside ; thus 
[)roceed with the two remaining portions of butter. 
Turn out upon the board the paste or dough which 
was previously mixed, roll it out gently, lay upon 
it one of the butter sheets, dredge on a little flour, 
roll it up; roll it out again, lay upoy it another 
butter sheet and proceed as before till all the but- 
ter is incorporated. This, if well baked, will en- 
sure a beautiful puff paste, and is very easily made 
after one trial, although the printed instructions 
may look complicated. 



PASTE SHELLS. 

Take sufficient rich puff paste prepared as in 
the two preceding recipes, roll very thin, cut to 
shape, and bake in a brisk oven in tin pans. 
Baked carefully, free from damp fruit, the paste 
rises better. When cool, fill the shells with stewed 
fruit, with jelly or preserves, with rich cream 
whipped to a stiff froth, with ripe raspberries or 
strawberries, or with sliced peaches. This makes 
an exceedingly delicious light dessert for dinner, 
and is equally palatable at supper. Raspberries, 



284 -MES. poeter's new cook-book. 

strawberries or sliced peaches, smothered with 
whipped cream, on these shells, cannot be ex- 
celled. 

EGG-PASTE SHELLS FOR TARTS. 

Rub quarter of a pound of butter into a pound 
of flour ; add two tablespoonsful of powdered loaf 
sugar and the well-beaten yolks of two eggs ; work 
well with a wooden spoon, and roll out very thin ; 
rub it over with the well- beaten white of an egg, 
and put instantly into a quick oven. This paste 
may be baked as shells or with fruit as tarts ; in 
thf. latter case, sift fine sugar over the fruit before 
baking. 

SUET PASTE. 

KuB half a pound of fresh beef-suet chopped 
very fine, but not melted, three-fourths of a pound 
of flour and a teaspoonful of salt well together ; 
put in just enough water to make a stiff paste, 
work well and roll twice at least. This paste is 
excellent for fruit puddings and dumplings that 
are boiled ; if well made, it will be light and 
flaky, and the suet imperceptible. It is also ex- 
cellent for meat-pies, baked or boiled.

285 



DRIED FRUIT PIES. 
Wash the fruit and soak it over-night; next 
morning stew it until nearly done, and sweeten to 
taste. The crust, both upper and under, should 
be rolled thin ; a thick crust to a fruit pie is un- 
desirable ; the top crust should be cut large enough 
to hivi over the under one ; put in the fruit cold, 
with plenty of juice; prick the top crust about 
the centre and hem the edges well together to 
keep in the juice; to "hem," the top crust must 
be folded over and under the edge of the bottom 
crust, lying between it and the pie dish; then 
dress the edge around with your thumb, and the 
pie is effectually "sealed." Place at once in a 
moderately hot oven, and bake quickly. 

GREEN APPLE PIE. 

We will give two methods, ourselves preferring 
the first, though the second is unexceptionable : - 

1. Pare and core tart apples (sweet apples never 
make good sauce or pies) ; stew them gently to a 
stiff smooth sauce, which flavor to taste and pass 
through a sieve or colander ; set it aside till quite 
cold ; bake a shell and put in your cold sauce (don't 
be stingy with your sauce), and cover with whipped 



286 MRS. pokter's new cook-book. 

cream or top-crust shells, or leave it uncovered, 
Bifting plenty of sugar and grating nutmeg over it. 
2. Pare, core and quarter tart apples, stew 
Bliglitly, sweetening and flavoring to taste ; strain 
off as dry as possible and do not mash your 
apples. For crust, baking, etc., see directions for 
" Dried Fruit Pies." 

JELLY AND PRESERVED FRUIT PIES. 

Preserved fruit and jellies require no baking ; 
hence, always bake a shell (see page 283) and put 
in the sweetmeats afterward ; you can cover with 
whipped cream (see page 274), or bake a top- 
crust shell ; the former is preferable for delicacy. 

RHUBARB PIE. 

Skin the stalks, cut them into small pieces, 
wash and put them in a pipkin to stew with no 
more water than what adheres to them; when 
done, mash them fine and put in a small piece 
of butter ; when cool, sweeten to taste ; if liked, 
add a little lemon-peel, cinnamon or nutmeg ; 
line your plate with thin crust, put in the filling, 
cover with crust, and bake in a quick oven ; sift 
Bugar over it when served. 



HOW TO MAKE PASTRY. 287 

PEACH PIE. 

Bake rich shells about two-thirds done ; if your 
peaches are fully ripe, cut them into halves or 
quarters, put in the shell, sweeten and flavor to 
taste, cover or not as you choose, and finish baking 
in a quich oven ; if the peaches are ripe but not 
soft, it will improve the flavor to sugar them down 
some hours before you wish to use them ; if not 
ripe, they should be stewed. You can make a 
delightful pie or tart by omitting top-crust and 
substituting for it a thick covering of whipped 
cream (see page 274). 

STRAWBERRY OR RASPBERRY PIB 

Must be made just as directed above for ripe 
peaches, except that berriea must not be cut. 

REAL CHEESECAKE. 

Four ounces of rich (not strong or old) cheeso 
cut into small pieces and beaten (a little at a time) 
to the consistency of butter ; add equal weight of 
sweet fresh butter, mixing the two thoroughly ; 
add gradually five eggs beaten stiff and smooth ; 
line pan on bottom and sides with paste (puff is 
best), fill with the mixture, grate nutmeg over the 



288 MES. porter's new cook-book. 

surface, and bake not too fast. If you wish it 
sweet, put in white sugar before you mix in the 
eggs ; also add spices to taste. 

BRANDT-WINE CHEESECAKE. 

Half a pound each of butter and sugar, eiglit 
eggs, one pint of milk, quarter of a pound of cur- 
rants, four ounces of bread, one tablespoonful each 
of brandy, wine and rose-water, one small nutmeg 
grated, half a teaspoonful of cinnamon ; put the 
milk on to boil ; beat up four eggs and stir into 
it ; when it is a thick curd, take it off, and when 
cool, mash it very fine ; crumb the bread and mix 
with the curd; beat the butter and sugar to a 
cream ; add the curd and bread to it ; then whisk 
the other four eggs thick and light, and pour them 
into the mixture ; then add gradually the brandy, 
wine, rose-water and spice, and 'astly the cur- 
rants ; line square tin pan, put in the filling, and 
bak 3 in a quich oven. 

EGG-COCOANUT CHEESECAKE. 

Twelve hard-boiled eggs rubbed through m 
Eieve (while hot), half a pound of butter, half a 
pound of pounded loaf sugar, half a pound of cur- 



HOW TO MAKE PASTRY. 289 

rants and a little nutmeg; brandy may be added, 
which flavors them nicely, or, if preferred, a little 
essence of lemon or almond. 



RICE CHEESECAKE. 

Quarter of a pound of butter, two ounces of 
ground rice, boiled and beaten ; mix well with 
sifted sugar to taste; when quite cool, add the 
rind and juice of one lemon and two eggs well 
beaten ; this will keep a month in a cool place. 

LEMON CHEESECAKE. 

Three ounces of butter, half a pound of loaf 
sugar, three eggs, leaving out the whites of two, 
the grated rind and juice of one large lemon; 
boil it till the sugar is dissolved and it becomes 
the consistency of honey ; line the pan with egg- 
paste (page 284), put in the above mixture, and 
bake in a quick oven. 

CREAM CHEESECAKE.— VERY DELICIOUS. 

One pint of sweet cream, the whites (well 
beaten) of three eggs; flavor in either of the 
following two ways : 1. One dozen or so of bitter 

25 



290 MKS. poutees new cook-book. 

almonds pounded and boiled in just enough milk; 
or, 2. The juice and grated outside rind of a large 
lemon or orange well mixed with four ounces of 
powdered loaf sugar ; mix the flavoring through 
the cream and egg-whites, line your pan with egg- 
paste (page 284) or rich puif paste, put in the 
mixture, sift fine sugar over, and bake in a quich 
oven. 

CUSTARD PIE. 

Boil three pints of milk and let it cool ; add 
three well-beaten eggs, two tablespoonsful of sugar 
and a little salt ; flavor with vanilla or rose ; line 
your pie-plate with paste, put in the custard, and 
bake till it is nearly firm. It is an excellent plan 
to set your lined plate in the ov^n till it begins to 
bake before putting in the custard : this prevents 
the crust from getting soft and soggy. 

CUSTARD PIE, No. 2. 

One quart of milk, one tablespoonful of flour, 
one ounce of butter, six ounces of sugar, six eggs, 
rose, orange or other flavor to taste; set the milk 
on the fire ; as soon as it boils put in the flour 
mixed in cold milk to the consistency of cream, 
and stir well and let it boil a few minutes ; then 



HOW TO MAKE PASTRY. 291 

remove from the fire, and stir in the butter and 
sugar ; when cool, whisk the eggs perfectly light 
and stir them and the flavoring in. As to baking, 
see preceding recipe. 

PLORENDINES. 

One quart of milk, three tablespoonsful of rice 
flour, half a pound of sugar, four ounces of butter, 
six eggs, two tablespoonsful of rose-water, salt, 
nutmeg and cinnamon to taste ; set the milk on 
the fire, and soon as it comes to a boil stir in the 
rice flour mixed with a little cold milk to the con- 
sistency of cream ; let it simmer a few minutes, 
take it off the fire and stir in the butter and salt ; 
when cool, gradually stir in the eggs whisked 
thick ; then add the other ingredients, and mix 
thoroughly ; line your plates with pujff or egg- 
paste (page 284), fill with the custard, and bake 
in a quick oven. 

PUMPKIN PIE. 

Boil the pumpkin in a very little water, and 
strain it through a sieve ; add to the pulp thus 
obtained milk, salt, cinnamon or ginger, sugar 
and as many eggs as you wish ; when no egg, or

only one, is used, pulverized cracker forms a good 
substitute ; line a deep pie-plate with plain paste, 
fill with the pumpkin, and bake. The propor- 
tions of the dilBferent ingredients vary so much to 
suit various tastes that we do not attempt here to 
designate them. 



A JERSEY GIRL'S RECIPE. —UNRIVALED. . 

Cut the pumpkin in half, remove the seeds, put 
the halves in a dripping-pan, skin side down, bake 
in a slow oven until you can readily scrape all the 
pulp out of the rind with a spoon (if it is brown 
as a nicely-baked loaf of bread, so much the better) ; 
mash fine, and while hot add (the quantities here 
are to each quart of pumpkin) four ounces of 
butter ; when cold, sweeten to taste and add one 
pint of cream or milk, the yolks of three eggs (if 
milk is used, use four eggs) well beaten, cinnamon 
and nutmeg to taste, one wineglassful of wine or 
brandy and the whites of the eggs beaten to a 
stiff froth ; stir well before adding the egg-whites 
and very lightly afterward ; line deep pie-plates 
with egg-paste (page 284), or plainer paste if you 
prefer it ; put in plenty of the mixture, and bake 
in a quich oven. 



HOW TO MAKE PASTRY. 293 

A cover or top-crust made similar to icing and 
put on before baking, or whipped cream dressing 
(page 274), adds to the appearance and to the 
quality of this and the almond, citron, cocoanut. 
lemon, etc., custard pies. 

THE DOWN-BAST EECIPB. 

Three pounds of pumpkin, six ounces of butter, 
six eggs, two tablespoonsful of wine, one table- 
sjjoonful of brandy, sugar, salt and spice to taste ; 
cut the pumpkin in slices, pare it, take out the 
seeds and soft parts, cut it into small pieces and 
etew it in very little water until it becomes tender ; 
then press it in a colander until quite dry, turn it 
out in a pan, put in the butter and a little salt, 
mash it very fine ; when cool, whisk the eggs until 
thick, and stir in ; then add sugar with the brandy, 
wine and spice; line your plates with paste, put 
in plenty of filling, and bake in a quick oven; 
when done, grate nutmeg and sift sugar over it. 

CARROT PIE. 

A VERY good substitute for pumpkin pie may 
be made by using carrots instead of pumpkin in 
the preceding recipe.

SWEET POTATO PIE. 
Boil sweet potatoes till you - can masli tliem ; 
then skin, mash, and strain the water out of them; 
add to each half pound one quart of milk, three 
spoonsful of melted butter, four well-beaten eggs, 
and sugar and spice tc taste. 

WHITE POTATO PIE. 

Precisely the same way, except you substitute 
white for sweet potatoes. 

ALMOND CUSTARD PIE. 

Half a pound each of butter and sugar, five 
eggs, one tablespoonful each of brandy, wine and 
rose-water, half a pound of sweet and two ounces 
bitter almonds blanched, dried and pounded to a 
paste; beat the butter and sugar until light; 
whisk the eggs until thick, and add by degrees ; 
then stir in the almonds, with the wine, brandy 
and rose-water, half of each at a time ; let it re- 
main a short time in a cool place ; line your plates 
with puff or egg paste, not forgetting to roll it 
much thinner in the centre than at the edge ; fill 
with the custard, and bake in a quick oven ; when 
done and cool, sift white sugar over it. The 
brandy and wine may be omitted. 



HOW TO MAKE PASTE Y. 295 

CREAM PIE WITHOUT CREAM. 
Two eggs, half a cupful of sugar, three table- 
spoonsful of flour, one pint of sweet milk ; bring 
the milk to a boil, mix the sugar, flour and eggs 
well beaten, and put them in the boiling milk ; 
when it begins to thicken, flavor with lemon or 
to taste, and let it get cold ; bake a shell and fill 
it with the custard. 



IMITATION COCOANUT CUSTARD PIE. 
Same as cocoanut custard pie, substituting grated 
raw sweet potato for the nut. 

MARMALADE CUSTARD PIES. 

Bake rich pufi" or egg-paste shells, and fill with 
custard made as follows : beat the yolks of six 
eggs till thick and firm ; stir in twelve ounces of 
marmalade or jelly (or stewed fruit is almost 
equally good) ; boil about ten minutes, stirring 
well all the time ; take it ofl" and put it in a stone- 
ware dish ; when quite cold, fill with it the shells, 
and serve with powdered loaf sugar and rich 
cream, or cover with icing made of the whites 
of the eggs and sufficient sugar, and set it in the

oveu and let it brown very slightly. The quan- 
tity of marmalade or jelly may be increased or 
decreased according to the fruit and to taste. 



LEMON CUSTARD PIE, No. 2. 

Geate one-half outside of a lemon and squeeze 
out the juice, yolks of two eggs, two tablespoonsful 
heaped of sugar, half a cup of water, one teaspoon- 
ful of butter ; stir well, and bake in a deep dish 
lined with crust ; beat the whites of the eggs to a 
stiff froth ; stir in two tablespoonsful of pulverized 
sugar and spread over the top of the pie as soon as 
it is baked ; set in the oven till the top is nicely 
browned. 

BANANA CUSTARD PIE. 

Same, except you take full-ripe bananas mashed 
to a paste ; flavor with rose. 

FRUIT CUSTARD PIE, 

Of almost any flavor, can be readily made by 
pjbstituting the fruit desired for those in the 
recipes above. In all custard pies it will be 
found advantageous to use a shell partially baked 
before putting in the custard. 



HOW TO MAKE PASTRY. 297 

PINE-APPLE CUSTARD PIE. 
Same as almond custard pie, except you use 
stewed pine apple instead of almonds ; flavor with 
lemoc or orange. 

CITRON CUSTARD PIE. 

Same as almond, except tliat you substitute 
half a pound of citron chopped fine for the 
almonds. 

COCOANUT CUSTARD PIE. 

Same as almond, except that you use half a 
pound of grated nut instead of the almonds, and 
omit the yolks of the eggs. 

LEMON CUSTARD PIE. 

Half a pound each of butter and sugar, two 
ounces of stale sponge cake rubbed fine, five eggs, 
one tablespoonful each of brandy and rose-water, 
the juice and the grated yellow rind of one large 
lemon ; beat the butter and sugar very light and 
add the sponge cake ; stir in gradually the eggs 
whisked thick, and lastly stir in, half at a time, 
the lemon, brandy and rose-water ; mix thoroughly 
without much beating; line plates with pufF or

egg-paste, fill with the custard, and bake in a 
quick oven. (See remark at end of pumpkin pie 
recipe, page 291.) 

ORANGE CUSTARD PIE. 

Same as preceding, substituting the juice and 
grated peel of an orange for the lemon. 

PINE-APPLE TART. 

Take a fine large ripe pine-apple ; remove the 
leaves and quarter it without paring, standing up 
each quarter in a deej) plate, and grating it down 
till you come to the rind ; strew plenty of pow- 
dered sugar over the grated fruit; cover it, and 
let it rest for an hour ; then jDut it into a porcelain 
kettle, and steam it in its own syrup till perfectly 
soft; have ready some empty shells of puff-paste; 
bake in patty-pans or in soup-plates ; when they 
are cool, fill them full with the grated pine-apple ; 
add more sugar, and lay round the rim a border 
of puff-paste. 

GOOSEBERRY PIE. 

Stew your gooseberries with plenty of white 
sugar, and use plain puff-paste for crust. 



HOW TO MAKE PASTRY. 299 

APPLE-PUMPKIN TART. 
Boil separately equal quantities of tart apples 
and pumpkin, and mash them well together; add 
a few currants, and sugar and nutmeg to taste; 
bake with a light crust top and bottom. The 
pumpkin must be strained as dry as possible. 

CRANBERRY TART. 

Stew your cranberries well, and sweeten to 
taste while stewing; mash them smooth (some 
prefer them not mashed) ; line your plates with 
thin puff-paste, fill, lay strips of rich puff-paste 
across the top, and bake in a moderate oven. (See 
articles on " Shells " for the best method of mak- 
ing cranberry pies and tarts.) 

QUINCE TART. 

Wash well, pare and core some fine ripe quinces, 
having cut out all the blemishes; put the coree 
and parings into a small saucepan and stew them 
in a little water till all broken to pieces; then 
strain and save the qu i nee- water ; having quar- 
tered the quinces, or sliced them in round slices, 
transfer them to a porcelain stew-pan, and pour 
over them the water in which they were boiled ; 



300 MES. POETEH'S NEW COOK-BOOK. 

when quite soft all through, sweeten to taste ; line 
deep plates with rich puff-paste, and bake ; then 
when both the shells and the fruit are cold, fill 
the shells to the top ; serve with powdered loaf 
sugar and rich cream, or dress with whipped 
cream (page 274). 

PEACH PIE, No. 2. 

Freestone peaches make the best pies, and the 
more juicy, the better. Peel and quarter your 
peaches ; stew in their own juice, putting in no 
water or as little as possible, and with white sugar 
sweeten to taste while stewing ; a flavor that most 
persons consider delightful is imparted to them by 
putting in some fresh green peach leaves, or some 
peach-stone kernels blanched, the leaves or ker- 
nels to be picked out immediately when done 
stewing; have ready baked shells, fill to top with 
the peaches (the latter cold, the shells not quite 
cold), cover and treat as directed in articles on 
shells (page 283). If the peaches are very ripe 
and juicy, they need not be stewed, but pare, 
quarter, sweeten with plenty of white sugar and 
set them aside till the sugar is well dissolved 
through the fruit, and they are then ready for 
the shells.

RED CURRANT PIE 
Is made in the same way as gooseberry, and ia 
deservedly very popular when well made and 
baked just right. 

FRUIT TARTS

MOLASSES PIE, 

Make a plain paste, allowing one quart of flour 
to quarter of a pound of fresh butter and quarter 
of a pound of lard ; cut up the butter into the pan 
of flour, and rub it into a dough with half a tum- 
bler of cold water ; roll out the paste into a sheet, 
and with a broad knife spread all over it one-half 
of the lard ; sprinkle it with flour, fold it and roll 
it out again ; spread on the remainder of the lard, 
dredge it slightly, fold it again and then divide it 
into two sheets ; line with one sheet a pie-dish 
and fill it with West India molasses mixed with 
butter and flavored with ginger and cinnamon, or 
lemon or orange; put on the other sheet of paste; 
crimp or notch the edges ; bake it of a pale brown, 
and send it to table fresh, but not hot.

CHERRY PIE. 

This is one of tlie most delightful of pies if 
made correctly. Those who have not time or are 
too lazy to remove the stones should never attempt 
to make cherry pies. Having removed the stones, 
put in sugar to taste, and stew the cherries slowly 
till they are quite done if you use shells, or till 
nearly done if you use paste ; a few of the pits 
added in stewing increase the richness of the 
flavor, or if you do not like this, use almond or 
vanilla flavoring. 

PLUM PIE. 

This must be made same as preceding, except 
flavor with orange or lemon peel. 

MINCE PIE. 

For crust use rich puff-paste, and roll not quite 
BO thin as for fruit pies, though on the other hand 
it must not be thick ; don't stint your filling : a 
thin mince pie is a mean afiair; mince pie should 
never be served cold, especially if it contain suet ; 
many prefer it warmed up, rather than fresh from 
the baking. Any one of the following recipes 
will give good mincemeat : 



Sow TO MAKE PASTEY. S03 

1. Four pounds of tongue or tender beef, tliree 
pounds of suet, eight pounds of chopped tart 
npples, three pounds each of currants (washed, 
dried and picked) and seeded raisins (Sultana 
raisins are preferable), six pounds of white sugar, 
or brown if preferred, two pounds of citron chopped 
fine, the grating of one orange, one ounce of cin- 
namon, quarter of an ounce eacli of cloves, mace 
and allspice, four nutmegs grated, one quart of 
Madeira wine, one pint of brandy ; boil the meat 
in salt water until tender; when cold, chop it 
very fine ; after removing every particle of mem- 
brane from the suet and chopping it fine, mix it 
through the meat, with salt just sufficient to re- 
move the fresh taste ; to this add the apples, after 
which, the sugar, fruit, spice and other ingredi- 
ents ; mix all well together and cover close ; if too 
dry (before using), the quantity required may be 
moistened with a little sweet cider. This cannot 
be excelled. 

2. Temperance. — An unexceptionable mince- 
meat may be made as above without the wine or 
l)randy by substituting good cider. Cream of tartar 
is said to make a good substitute. 

3. Plain. — Boil till tender about three pounds 
of lean stewing beef; chop very fine one pound of 



804 MKs. pobter's new COOE-BOOK. 

Buet (cold roast beef, if quite fat, will answer the 
purpose without the addition of suet) ; pare, core 
and chop enough apples to weigh at least as much 
as the meat; stone and chop three pounds of 
raisiDs; mix these together well, and add one 
pound of brown sugar and half a pint of molasses, 
one tablespoonful of cloves, one tablespoonful of 
cinnamon, one nutmeg grated, one teaspoonful of 
ginger and one teaspoonful of black pepper, a little 
salt, one tablespoonful of extract of lemon or van- 
illa, or the rind and juice of two or three lemons; 
moisten with sweet cider, or a little sharp vinegar 
instead. This will make very good pies, but will 
not keep long. 

4. KiCH. — Boil till tender a beef tongue weigh- 
ing about four or five pounds (this should lie in 
salt water a day or two before boiling) ; when cold, 
mince it very fine, after removing the skin and all 
unnecessary fat which surrounds it; chop two 
pounds of suet very fine, also at least six pounds 
of the best tart apples; prepare four pounds of 
raisins and the same of currants; mix all these 
together, and add the juice and rind of four fresh 
lemons, four grated nutmegs, two teaspoonsful of 
cloves and a few blades of mace, one pound and a 
half of white sugar and one pound of citron cut in 



HOW TO MAKE PASTEY. 305 

slips; cue pound of sweet almonds blanched and 
pounded in a gill of rose-water is a fine addition ; 
mix all these, and moisten with three pints of port 
wine or brandy ; then closely pack and tightly 
cover. It will keep excellently all winter. 

5. Delicate. — Boil calf's feet very tender with 
a little salt, and when cold, chop the meat fine ; put 
in a small proportion of suet, and apples, spices, 
currants, light wine or cider and sugar ; citron, 
green ginger or sweet almonds will be a decided 
improvement. This is delicious, but will not keep 
well. 

6. Country Pig. — Boil very tender pigs' 
tongues and hearts, and when cold, chop fine; 
then measure and mix as follows : One bowlful 
of minced meat, two bowlsful of apples chopped 
fine, one bowlful of cider (boiled); one and a half 
cupsful of molasses, one cupful of sugar, two des- 
sertspoonsful of cloves, two dessertspoonsful of cin- 
namon, two dessertspoonsful of allspice, a little 
nutmeg, a double handful of raisins and a few 
currants or a little citron or green ginger. 

7. Egg instead of Meat. — To enough tart 
apples to weigh about twelve ounces when pared, 
cored and chopped fine, add six large eggs beaten 
thick and half a pint of cream ; spice, sugar, 

26* u 



306 MRS. poetee's new coos-book. 

raiains and currants, wine or cider, as for mince- 
meat. This makes exceedingly delicious pies, but 
it will not keep. 

8. No-meat. — Take one pound of currants, one 
pound of apples chopped fine, one pound of moist 
sugar, one pound of suet well chopped, one pound 
of raisins stoned and chopped, the rind and juice 
of two lemons, nutmeg, one teaspoonful each of 
cinnamon, clove and ginger, and one glassful of 
wine. To keep this you must pack it well, air- 
tight, and set in a cool place. 

LENT PIE. 

One pint and a half of new unskimmed milk, 
three ounces of rice flour, three ounces of butter, 
four ounces of sugar, six eggs, four to six ounces 
of currants ; boil fifteen minutes the rice flour in 
the milk ; take off the fire and stir in the butter 
and sugar ; then add the eggs well beaten ; season 
and flavor to taste ; line large patty -pans or large 
saucers with thin plain or puff-paste, and when 
the mixture is quite cold, fill them about three- 
fourths full, sprinkle the currants over the tops, 
and bake fifteen or twenty minutes in a moderate 
oven. A. plainer kind may be made as follows? 



HOW TO MAKE PASTRY. 307 

One quart of milk, five ounces of rice flour, one 
ounce and a half to three ounces of butter, four 
ounces of sugar, four large eggs and three ounces 
of currants ; season and flavor to taste. 

NEW LEMON PIE. 

Two grated lemons, two eggs, one pint of New 
Orleans molasses, two and one-half tablespoonsful 
of corn-starch mixed in a little water ; mix all to- 
gether, and boil for a few minutes in one quart of 
water ; bake with two crusts. This recipe makes 
about eight pies. 

RICH CREAM PIE. 

Six eggs, two cupsful each of sugar and flour, 
two teaspoonsful of cream of tartar, one teaspoon- 
ful of soda dissolved in two teaspoonsful of cold 
milk ; rub the cream of tartar in the flour ; stir 
the eggs, sugar and flour a minute, and add the 
soda when it is ready to bake ; this makes three 
pies ; split them when cold, and put in the follow- 
ing cream : One pint of milk, one cupful of sugar, 
one-half a cupful of flour, two eggs ; beat eggs, 
sugar and flour together and pour into the boiling 
milk ; flavor with lemon or vanilla. 



308 MRS. portek's new cook-book. 

CHERRY AND CURRANT TART. 
Stem and stone your cherries; take an equal 
weight of very ripe red currants, press them 
through a sieve, add the juice to your cherries 
with the crumb of two sponge cakes, quarter of a 
pound of sugar and one wineglassful of brandy ; 
put it into a tart-dish lined with a rim of paste, 
cover it with a top crust, and bake it for an hour. 

TOMATO MINCE PIE. 

To one peck of green tomatoes add seven pounds 
of sugar; chop fine, and stew two hours; when 
nearly cold, add five lemons chopped fine ; put in 
a cool, dry place, to be used at convenience; when 
you bake, use thin puff under-crust, with or with- 
out upper-crust. 

POTATO PIE. 

One pound of potatoes, white or sweet, mashed 
and worked smooth, half a pound of sugar, four 
eggs, juice and grated rind of two large lemons or 
two small oranges, one cupful of rich milk, quarter 
of a pound of melted butter ; bake with an under- 
crust only, or with both under-crust and whipped 
cream cover.

GENERAL REMARKS. 
Among the luxuries of the dinner-table there ia 
not one that is more universally appreciated by 
every taste than a good pudding, and there is no 
department of the culinary art that demands 
closer care and clearer judgment than the making, 
baking or boiling and serving of puddings ; while 
all kinds, from the rich Plum to the plain Hasty 
Pudding, depend as much on the cook as upon the 
materials used: the boiled puddings are especially 
difficult to get done just right ; a very slight mis- 
take or seemingly trifling neglect will too often 
convert what should be delicious and nutritious 
into a distasteful, heavy, injurious substance. 
The General Kemarks under the heads of Cakes 
and Pastry mostly apply to the several classes of 
Puddings, and there remains little to say as to 
selection of best quality of ingredients and the ex- 



310 MES. poktek's new cook-book. 

ercise of great care in their manipulation and 
cooking. 

Boiled custard puddings must not be boiled 
over a hot fire rapidly, but simmered steadily ; if 
boiled too vigorously, the surface will be honey- 
combed instead of smooth and velvety; a well- 
buttered piece of writing paper should be laid 
between the custard and the cloth if boiled in a 
basin, or between the custard and the lid if boiled 
in a mould ; the mould or basin should also be 
well buttered and filled full ; after it is taken 
from the fire it should stand in the basin or 
mould full five minutes before it is emptied out, or 
it will break or spread. 

Boiled batter puddings are usually lighter and 
better boiled in a cloth with plenty of room to 
swell; the water should be ready boiling, and the 
pudding put in instantly as soon as well beaten 
up and tied in the cloth ; the cloth should be 
steeped in hot water and well floured before it 
receives the pudding. 

Unless you want it to become heavy, you must 
hurry your joudding to table as soon as it is 
done ; batter puddings and those made with paste 
are especially liable to settle if they are allowed to 
c-ool in the slightest degree before they are dishec^ 



HOW TO MAKE PUDDINGS. 311 

up, and while in the water if you allow the boil- 
ing to stop for an instant, the pudding is almost 
sure to become heavy and uneatable. 

All sweet puddings require a little salt, to pre- 
vent insipidity, and to draw out the flavor of the 
several ingredients, but a grain too much will 
spoil any pudding. 

In puddings where wine, brandy, cider, lemon- 
juice or any acid is used, it should be stirred in last, 
and gradually, or it is apt to curdle the milk or eggs. 

The pudding-cloth should be very carefully 
kept ; if not quite clean and perfectly dry, or if 
kept in a damp place, it very soon gets musty or 
nasty, and will spoil any pudding boiled in it ; as 
soon as the pudding is taken from it, it should be 
thrown into ley-water or water in which soda (two 
ounces to the gallon) has been dissolved, to soak ; 
then washed thoroughly, to get every particle of 
grease and batter off, and carefully rinsed and 
dried quickly, in the open air if possible. It is 
better to make the pudding-cloth of stout muslin 
that will not too readily admit the water to the 
pudding. 

Under the head of Pastry we have given recipes 
for making paste for such fruit and other puddings 
as are made with paste, and here, before giving 



312 MES. FOETER*S NEW COOK-BOOK. 

specific recipes, we present a paragraph of generai 

directions how to mix 

BATTER FOR PUDDINaS. 
Put the flour and salt into a bowl, and stir them 
together ; whisk the eggs thoroughly, strain them 
through a fine hair-sieve, and add them very 
gradually to the flour, for if too much liquid be 
poured to it at once it will be full of lumps, and it 
is easy, with care, to keep the batter perfectly 
smooth ; beat it well and lightly with the back 
of a strong wooden spoon, and after the eggs are 
added, thin it with milk to a proper consistency ; 
the whites of the eggs beate*i separately to a solid 
froth, and stirred gently into the mixture the 
instant before it is tied up for boiling, or before it 
is put into the oven to be baked, will render it re- 
markably light. When fruit is added to the bat- 
ter, it must be made thicker than when it is served 
plain, or the fruit will sink to . the bottom of the 
pudding. Batter should never stick to the knife 
when it is sent to the table ; it will do this both 
when a less than a suflSicient number of eggs is 
mixed with it and when it is not enoiigh cooked ; 
about four eggs to the half pound of flour will 
make it firm enough to cut smoothly. 



HOW TO MAKE PUDDINGS. 313 

PEAR, PEACH OR APPLE PUDDING. 
Pare some nice ripe pears (to wei^h about 
three-fourths of a poundj ; put lliciii m a sauce- 
pan with a few cloves, some lemon or orange 
peel, and stew about a quarter of an hour in two 
cupsful of white wine ; put them in your pudding- 
dish, and having made the following custard, one 
pint of cream, four eggs, sugar to taste ; beat eggs 
and sugar well, grate some nutmeg, add the cream 
by degrees, stirring all the time, — pour this over 
the pears, and bake in a quick oven. Apples or 
peaches served likewise will be found tip-top. 

BREAD-TOP CUSTARD PUDDING. 
One quart of new milk, three eggs, half a pound 
of sugar, a little salt; pour these into your pudding- 
dish, mix well, slice thin some bread, butter it, 
and lay the slices over the top of your pudding; 
bake about one hour. 

RICE PUDDING— VERY NICE. 
Boil one cupful of rice slowly; cool, add one 
cupful of milk, one small teaspoonful of soda if 
the milk be sour, one spoonful of lard or butter, 
two eggs, a little corn-starch ; stir thoroughly ; 
bake in a slow oven.

814 MRS. poeter's new cook-book. 

QUINCE, APPLE OR GOOSEBERRY PUDDING. 
Pare and core three large quinces, and boil 
them till soft, but not till they break ; drain off 
the water, and mash the quinces with the back of 
a wooden spoon ; stir into them quarter of a pound 
of sugar and the juice of an orange or small lemon, 
and set them away to cool ; when quite cold, mix 
with them about two ounces of butter and seven 
eggs (which have been well beaten), and bake the 
mixture in puff-paste; before they go to table, 
grate white sugar over the top, or they may be 
covered with icing or whipped cream and brandy. 
Apple puddings may be made in the same man- 
ner, and also puddings of stewed gooseberries. 



APPLE AND SAGO PUDDING.— NO EGGS. 

Wash one teacupful of large sago, and let it 
stand one hour or more in one pint of cold water ; 
butter a suitable dish, and put a layer of sliced 
tart apples, sweetened and flavored, on the bottom ; 
strain the sago nearly dry, and spread it over the 
apples ; put another layer of apples, sift plenty of 
sugar, and grate nutmeg over the top, and bake in 
a moderate oven. It may be eaten hot with wine 
or brandy dip, or cold with sweetened cream. 



HOW TO MAKE PUDDINGS. 815 

RICE PUDDING.— NO EGGS. 
Wash and pick two tablespoonsful of rice, put 
it in a deep pie-dish and with it a like quantity 
of sugar ; pour in a pint of sweet milk ; float on 
tlie top a few shavings of butter or a small quan- 
tity of nice minced beef suet ; bake very slowly 
for at least two hours. 

COTTAGE PUDDING. 

One heaping pint of flour, half a cupful of 
sugar, one egg, one cupful of milk, one teaspoonful 
of soda dissolved in the milk, two teaspoonsful of 
cream of tartar rubbed dry in the flour; bake in a 
moderate oven ; serve with wine or brandy sauce. 

QUEEN PUDDING. 

Two cupsful of sugar, one cupful of butter, one 
cupful of sweet milk, four cupsful of flour, six 
eggs, one wineglassful of wine ; bake in pudding- 
dish.

same of seeded raisins ; boil it in a bag made of 
thick cotton cloth, and before filling, it should be 
wrung out of hot water and floured inside; it 
must not be entirely filled with the pudding, as it 
will swell when boiling ; place an old plate at the 
bottom of the pot in which you boil the pudding, 
to keep the bag from sticking to it and burning ; 
let the water boil when you put the pudding in, 
and in a few minutes turn the bag over. There

EXCELSIOH APPLE PUDDING. 

Bread crumbs, suet, apples, currants and brown 
sugar half a pound of each, a dozen sweet almonds 
chopped fine, one wineglassful of brandy, a little 
cinnamon and spice to taste, the apples to be 
pared, cored and chopped fine, the suet shred and 
chopped ; mix all well together, adding the whites 
of eggs just before the brandy, which should be 
the last ingredient put in ; boil for three hours, 
either in a pudding-bag or a mould well buttered. 

DORA'S WHORTLEBEPRT PUDDINGS. 

1. One quart of sour milk or buttermilk, one 
teaspoonful of soda, a little salt ; make a thick 
batter of wheat meal or Graham, and stir in one 
pint of huckleberries. This makes a large pud-

ding, and should be steamed in a two-quart basin 
two hours ; any sauce is good, but I prefer sweet- 
ened cream. 

2. One pint of sweet milk scalding hot, a large 
pinch of salt ; stir in flour till quite thick ; let it 
cool while you beat up four eggs ; stir in the eggs 
and one pint of huckleberries ; steam nearly two 
hours, and serve with sweetened cream. 

Either of these puddings is good with any fruit 
— apples, crab apples, berries or raisins. 

CARROT-POTATO PUDDING. 

One pound of flour, one pound of suet chopped 
fine, three-quarters of a pound of sugar, one pound 
each of carrots and potatoes well boiled and mashed 
together, half a pound of raisins, three-quarters of 
a pound of bread crumbs, spice, flavoring and peel 
optional; mix the whole together with a little 
water; it must not be too stiff, and certainly not 
too moist; rub a basin well with dripping, and 
boil for three hours. 

CREAM TAPIOCA PUDDING. 

Soak three tablespoonsful of tapioca in water 

three hours; put the same in one quart of boilii!^'

milk ; boil fifteen minutes ; beat the yolks of four 
eggs in one cupful of sugar ; stir them into the 
pudding five minutes before it is done; flavor with 
lemon or vanilla ; beat the whites of four eggs to 
a stiff froth with three tablespoonsful of sugar ; 
put this over the pudding, and bake five minutes ; 
one spoonful or two of prepared cocoanut in with 
the yolks and sugar is very good; cocoanut can 
also be sprinkled over the top, on the whites, 
before putting in to brown. 

JERSEY PUDDING. 

Butter a deep pudding-dish ; line the bottom 
with thin slices of very light bread well buttered ; 
pare half a peck of juicy freestone peaches ; put a 
layer of peaches, then a layer of sugar ; then more 
peaches, sugar and bread alternately, until the 
dish is nearly full ; lastly, fit a cover of bread 
and butter on the top ; put a plate over it, and 
set it in the oven ; when the juice begins to boil up, 
take off the plate ; bake it until the peaches are 
perfectly tender ; let it get cold, and it is delicious. 

PEACH DUMPLINGS. 

Substitute peaches for apples in recijje on 
page 345, and you will have delightful dumplings.

THE BEST BREAD PUDDING. 
Take the inside of a small loaf of bakeiN 
bread, put into a deep pan with two ounces of 
butter; pour over it one pint of boiling milk; 
after remaining a sufficient length of time to 
become completely saturated, with a spoon mash 
it until very smooth and fine ; whisk six eggs until 
thick and light, which stir in gradually ; then 
add one quart of milk; mix all well together, and 
sweeten to taste ; pour the mixture into a pud- 
ding-dish, sift a little cinnamon over the top, and 
bake in a quick oven ; when done and cold, have 
ready some fine ripe peaches, which pare, slice 
and sugar; just before sending the pudding to 
table, place as many on the top as the dish will 
conveniently hold, and sift over white sugar. 
This is second to none, especially with cream 
sauce. 

CULPEPPER PUDDING. 
Six large pippin apples, six large tablespoonsful 
of sugar, quarter of a pound of butter, quarter of 
a pound of stale sponge cake crumbed, six eggs, 
one small nutmeg grated, the grating and juice of 
one large lemon ; pare, core and quarter the apples, 
put them in an earthen pipkin in half a pint of 
water to stew ; when soft, but not broken, drain 



Z4A MEs. poeter's new cook-book. 

and mash them smooth with the butter; when 
quite cold, add the sugar, sponge cake, nutmeg 
and lemon alternately; then whisk the eggs until 
very thick, which stir in gradually ; mix all well 
together, then put it in a buttered dish, and bake 
in rather a quidk oven three-quarters of an hour ; 
when done, sift white sugar over; if liked, orna- 
ment with thin slices of citron. 

PEESBRVB DUMPLINGS. 

Peeseeved peaches, plums, quinces, cherries or 
any other sweetmeat ; make a light crust, and roll 
a small piece of moderate thickness, and fill with 
the fruit in quantity to make the size of a peach 
dumpling ; tie each one in a dumpling cloth, drop 
them into hot water, and boil half an hour ; when 
done, remove the cloth, send to table hot, and eat 
with cream. 

PLUMPING CURRANTS FOR PUDDINGS. 
Befoee putting them into puddings currants 
ghould be plumped. This is done by putting boil- 
ing water on them ; soak them well, and lay them 
on a sieve or cloth before the fire ; pick them clean 
from the stones ; this makes them look larger and 
improves the flavor, besides cleaning them. 



HOW TO MAKE PUDDINGS. 345 

APPLE DUMPLINGS— BOILED. 
Peel and cut the apples into halves, scooping 
out the cores ; take one pint and a half of flour, 
three-fourths of a cupful of sour milk and cream, 
one-fourth of a teaspoonful of soda ; stir the soda 
into the milk until it foams ; mix tlie dough stiff 
enough to roll easily; just before covering fill the 
places scooped out of the apple with sugar and 
half an almond; when ready, drop them into 
boiling water. Dumplings are much more deli- 
cate and healthy by not having grease in the 
pastry. Almost any moderately tart fruit can be 
used instead of apples. 

BAKED DUMPLINGS. 

Use raised or puff-paste instead of the boiled 
dumpling paste. 

TEMPERANCE FOAM SAUCE. 

Beat up, as for hard sauce, white sugar with 
butter, until very light, in the proportion of half 
a cupful of butter to one cupful of sugar; flavor 
with essence of lemon or bitter almonds; fifteen 
minutes before serving, set the bowl in a pan of 
hot water and stir it till hot. It will rise in a 
white foam to the top of the bowl. 



346 MRS. poktee's new cook-book. 

NUN BUTTER. - 
Four ounces of butter, six ounces of sugar, as 
much wine as the butter will take ; beat the butter 
and sugar together, and gradually add the wine 
and a little nutmeg. 

WINE SAUCE. 

Two ounces of butter, two teaspoonsful of flour, 
half a pint of boiling water, one gill of Madeira 
wine, quarter of a pound of sugar, half a grated 
nutmeg; mix the flour and butter together, pour 
in the boiling water, let it boil a few minutes ; 
then add the sugar and wine ; just before going to 
table add the nutmeg ; serve hot. 

PLAIN SAUCES. 

1. Substitute vinegar or lemon juice for the 
wine in the recipe for Nun Butter. 

2. Omit the wine from the wine sauce, and you 
will have a very nice sauce. 

3. An excellent sauce may be found at close of 
recipe for Sweet or Irish Potato Pudding (page 
817).

GENERAL REMARKS. 

This head includes some of the most delicate 
and delicious dishes that can be gotten up for the 
table. Most of them are cheap and economical, 
while none are very costly, and all are not only 
palatable but wholesome; many are nice supper 
desserts. The only general direction that we 
need offer is — care: in no branch of culinary 
economy is this more essential than in the pre- 
paration of the little delicacies that add so much 
to the attractiveness of a well-kept table. 



BAKED FRUIT. 

Apple.— An apple may be spoiled in the 
baking — often is. Your dish must be scrupu- 
lously clean, and your baking must be done 
leisurely. You can reduce, burn an apple in 
a short time, but if you bake for several hours — 

347 



348 MRS. torter's new cook-book. 

three to four, more or less, according to your fruit, 
some kinds baking more readily than others — you 
will have a soft, pulpy fruit, wrinkled and brown, 
and shining, whole, or perhaps with a slight ver- 
tical break, which break must occur, if it occur at 
all, toward the last of the baking ; occurring early, 
it will intercept the baking at that place, as the 
exposed part is a powerful non-conductor or re- 
sister of heat. On the other hand, the peel is a 
good conductor, and, with a moderate fire, will 
bake and finish your fruit. It will do this with- 
out breaking the skin, though it may strain it at 
first (or at any stage) very tightly ; yet a good 
strong skin will resist the strain sufficiently to 
keep it intact and preserve the juice, which must 
not be permitted to escape. Of course only sound 
ajDples, thoroughly free from, vermin and rot, sound 
throughout, core and all, must be used. For if 
there is a \/orm or rot or any foreign odorous sub- 
stance, thi& itself is cooked, and penetrates more 
or less thv-' whole mass. When your apple is 
done, just done, take it out and at once cool it. 
This in order to have as little of the core afiect 
the flavor of the fruit as possible. Cooked with 
the rest, it will do this, and the longer it is hot; 
the more the bitter principle of the seeds will be 



LIGHT DESSERTS, CREAMS, ETC. 349 

distributed. The better way (and the only one if 
your fruit is quite sour) is to lay the fruit oi^eii, 
smoking hot ; take out the core, clean and sprinkle 
sugar over the mass ; work a little with the spoon, 
50 as to mix and fine the pulp well, then close as 
before ; set away till cold, and serve with or with- 
out rich cream. 

Pears. — 1. Take quarter of a peck of pears, wai^h 
and put them into a pan, with one pound of brown 
sugar and half a pint of water ; bake in a moderatt 
oven until the fruit becomes tender; when cool, 
and before sending to table, sift over white sugar. 

2. Pare and put the fruit into a pan, and to 
quarter of a peck of pears, allow three half pints 
of steam syrup ; let them bake slowly in a moder- 
ate oven until soft. 

3. Pare and core the pears, without dividing; 
place them in a pan, and fill up the orifice with 
brown sugar; add a little w^ater, and let them 
bake until perfectly tender. 



APPLE FLOAT. 

Take six large apples, pare, slice and stew 
I hem in as much water as will cover them ; when 
well done, press them through a sieve and make 

30 



350 MRS. porter's new cook-book.. 

very sweet with crushed or loaf sugar; while 
cooling, beat the whites of four eggs to a stiff 
froth, and stir in the apples ; flavor with lemon 
or vanilla; serve with sweet cream. Quite as 
good as peaches and cream. 



DELICIOUS DISH OF APPLES. 

Take two pounds of apples, pare and core them, 
slice them into a pan ; add one pound of loaf 
sugar, the juice of three lemons and the grated 
rind of one ; let these boil about two hours ; turn 
it into a mould, and serve with thick custard or 
cream. 

APPLE SOUFFLE. 

Stew the apples with a little lemon peel ; 
sweeten them, then lay them pretty high' round 
the inside of a dish ; make a custard of the yolks 
of two eggs, a little cinnamon, sugar and milk; 
let it thicken over a slow fire, but not boil; when 
ready, pour it in the inside of the apple ; beat the 
whites of the eggs to a strong froth, and cover the 
whole ; throw over it a good deal of pounded 
sugar, and brown it a fine brown 



LIGHT DESSERTS, CREAMS, ETC. 35l 

POMMES AU RIZ. 
Peel a number of apples of a good sort, take 
out the cores, and let them simmer in a syrup of 
clarified sugar, with a little lemon peel ; wash and 
pick some rice, and cook it in milk, moistening it 
therewith by little and little, so that the grains 
may remain whole ; .sweeten it to taste, and add a 
little salt and a taste of lemon peel ; spread the 
rice upon a dish, mixing some apple preserve with 
it, and place the apples upon it, and fill up the 
vacancies between the apples with some of the 
rice ; place the dish in the oven until the surface 
gets brown, and garnish with spoonsful of bright- 
colored preserve or jelly. 



GREEN CORN DELIGHT. 

Take a dozen ears of green corn (sweet is best), 
and, without boiling, grate or scrape off the grains ; 
into this stir two tablespoonsful of flour, also a well- 
beaten egg, a little salt, a couple of spoonsful of 
sugar, and, lastly, about a gill of sweet milk and 
a small lump of butter ; stir all together well, and 
bake in a well-buttered tin pan for one hour in a 
hot oven ; eat with butter and sugar or sweetened 
cream. 



352 MPvS. poetee's new cook-book. 

FLOATING ISLAND OP APPLES. 
Bake or scald eight or nine large apples ; when 
cold, pare them and pulp them through a sieve ; 
beat up this pulp with sugar, and add to it the 
rvhites of four or five eggs previously beaten up 
with a small quantity of rose-water ; mix this into 
I he pulp a little at a time, and beat until quite 
light; heap it up on a dish, with a rich custard 
or jelly around it. 

APPLE SNOW. 

Stew some fine flavored sour applet tender, 
sweeten to taste, strain them through a fine wire 
sieve, and break into one pint of strained apples 
the white of an egg; whisk the apple and egg 
very briskly, till quite stiff, and it will be as 
white as snow ; eaten with a nice boiled custard 
it makes a very desirable dessert. 

QUINCE DELIGHT. 

Bake ripe quinces thoroughly ; when cold, strip 
off the skins, place them in a glass dish, and sprin- 
kle them with white sugar ; serve with rich cream. 
This makes a beautiful dish ; it is simple and in- 
expensive, also a general favorite. 



LIGHT DESSERTS, CREAMS, ETC 353 

APPLE CHARLOTTE. 
Take any number of apples you may desire to 
use ; peel them, cut them into quarters and take 
out the core; cut the quarters into slices, and let 
ihem cook over a brisk fire with butter, sugar and 
powdered cinnamon until they are en marmalade ; 
cut thin slices of crumb of bread, dip them in 
butter, and with them line the sides and bottom 
of a tin shape; fill the middle of the shape with 
alternate layers of the apple and any preserve you 
may choose, and- cover it with more thin slices of 
bread ; then place the shape in an oven or before 
the fire until the outside is a fine brown, and turn 
it out upon a dish, and serve either hot or cold. 



CHARLOTTE RUSSE. 

Take one ounce of isinglass or of gelatine, and 
soften it by soaking it a while in cold water ; then 
boil it slowly in one pint of cream sweetened with 
quarter of a pound of fine loaf sugar (adding a 
handful of fresh rose leaves, if convenient, tied in 
a thin muslin bag) till it is thoroughly dissolved 
and well mixed ; take it off the fire, and set to 
cool, and beat together till very light and thick 
four whole eggs and yolks only of four others ; 

30* 



354 MEs. poutek's new cook-book. 

stir tlie beaten eggs gradually into the mixture of 
cream, sugar and isinglass, and set it again over 
the fire ; stir it well, and see that it only simmers, 
taking it off before it comes quite to a boil; then,' 
while it is warm, stir in sufficient extract of roses 
to give it a high rose flavor and a fragrant smell ; 
have ready two moulds lined with lady cake or 
almond sponge cake ; fill them with the mixture 
and set them on ice ; before they go to table ice

rose. 

CHOCOLATE CHARLOTTE RUSSB. 

Havijs^g soaked in cold water one ounce of isin- 
glass or of gelatine, shave down three ounces of 
the best chocolate, which must have no spice or 
sugar in it, and mix it gradually into one pint of 
cream, adding the soaked isinglass ; set the cream, 
chocolate and isinglass over the fire in a porcelain 
kettle, and boil it slowly till the isinglass is dis- 
solved thoroughly and the whole is well mixed ; 
Lhon take it off the fire and let it cool ; have ready 
eight yolks of eggs and four whites beaten all to- 
gether until very light, and stir them gradually 
into the mixture in turn with half a pound of 
powdered loaf sugar ; simmer the whole over the 



LIGHT DESSERTS, CREAMS, ETC. 355 

fire, but do not let it quite boil ; then take it off, 
and whip it to a strong froth ; line your moulds 
with sponge cake, and set them on ice. If you 
like a strong chocolate flavor, take four ounces of 
the cocoa. 

A DISH OP SNOW. 

Take a large cocoanut, break it in pieces, pare 
off the dark skin ; throw the pieces into cole 
water, wipe them dry, and then grate them on a 
coarse grater; serve the grated nut in a small 
glass bowl or dish, to be eaten with ices, preserves, 
jellies or jams. 

MOCK CHARLOTTE RUSSB. 

One cupful of butter, two cupsful of sugar, four 
cupsful of flour, one cupful of sour milk, four eggs, 
one teaspoonful of soda; bake in layers as for 
jelly cake. For the inside : One pint of sweet

ITALIAN CHARLOTTE. 
Soak in equal portions of wine and water sweet- 
ened with loaf sugar some slices of sponge cake ; 
put them in a glass bowl ; make a custard in pro- 
portion of eight eggs to one quart of milk and six 
ounces of sugar ; when cold, lay the custard over 
the sponge cake ; beat the whites of three eggs to 
a froth ; add by degrees three tablespoonsful of 
powdered loaf sugar ; flavor with lemon or vanilla, 
and with a spoon lay it tastefully over the top. 

CROQUETTES DE POMMES. 

Cook the apple just as for the charlotte, but 
instead of putting it into the jelly shape you roll 
into balls or rather cakes, which you cover with 
egg and bread crumbs, and fry of a rich brown. 

FLOATING ISLANDS. 

1. One quart of cream, whites of five eggs, half 
a pound of powdered loaf sugar ; whisk the egga 
to a froth, add the sugar, one teaspoonful at a 
time, and flavor with vanilla ; sweeten and flavor 
the cream with wine to taste ; pour it into a bowl 
or dish, and place the island tastefully on top. 

2. One quart of milk sweetened, the whites of 



JJGHT DESSERTS, CKEAMS, ETC. 357 

six eggs, wine to the taste, half a pound of pulver- 
ized sugar for the island, a little currant jelly ; 
beat the eggs, and add the half pound of sugar by 
degrees, and as much currant jelly as will make it 
a fine pink ; pour the milk in a glass bowl ; with 
a tablespoon place the island on it in heaps, taste- 
fully arranged. 

SILVER LAKE CUSTARD. 

Take two pounds of sponge cake (baked in a 
square pan) ; place it in a deep dish ; then take 
three pints of cream or rich milk, one gill of 
Madeira wine and sweeten to taste, with which 
saturate the sponge cake completely ; have ready 
an island made as above. No. 2, and with a table- 
spoon place it on the top of the cake, not allowing 
the spoonsful to touch ; if in strawberry season, 
just before going to table place six or eight large 
strawberries on each spoonful ; sift white sugar 
over, and eat with the remaining cream. This is 
very nice, and likewise ornamental. 

BALLOONS. 

One pint of milk, three eggs, one pint of flour ; 
separate the eggs, beat the yolks until light, and 
mix with the milk, and stir into the flour gradu- 



358 MRS. poetek'"s new cook-book. 

allj ; beat it well with one saltspoonful of salt : 
thei\ whisk the whites until stiff and dry, and stir 
thr mgh. lightly, half at a time ; butter small cups, 
fill them half full of the mixture, and bake in a 
qv/^::k oven; when done, turn them out of the 
cups, place them on a heated dish, and send to 
table hot ; eat with wine sauce. 

CUP CUSTARD. 

Eight eggs, five ounces of sugar, one quart of 
new milk, sugar to taste ; beat the eggs, add the 
sugar and milk with a little rose-water and the 
grating of an orange or lemon j fill your custard- 
cups, sift a little cinnamon over the top, set them 
in the oven in a shallow pan of hot water ; as soon 
as the custard is thick,- take them out or it will be 
spoiled with whey ; let them be cold when sent to 
table ; they are very nice with fresh fruit sugared 
and placed on the top of each — strawberries, 
peaches or raspberries, as preferred. 

FRENCH CUSTARD. 

One quart of milk, eight eggs, sugar and cinna- 
mon to taste ; separate the eggs, beat the yolks

LIGHT DESSERTS, CREAMS, ETC. 359 

and sweeten to taste ; put it into a pan or farina 
kettle, place it over a slow fire and stir it all the 
time until it becomes a custard ; then pour it into 
a pudding-dish to get cold; whisk the whites until 
stiff and dry ; have ready a pan of boiling water, 
on the top of which place the whites ; cover and 
place them where the water will keep sufficiently 
hot to cause a steam to pass through and cook 
them ; place in a dish (suitable for the table) a 
layer of custard and white alternately ; on each 
layer of custard grate a little nutmeg with a tea- 
spoonful of wine ; reserve a layer of white for the 
cover, over which grate nutmeg; then send to 
table, and eat cold. 



SYLLABUB. 

1. One quart of rich milk (or cream), half a 
pint of wine, six ounces of loaf sugar; put the 
sugar and wine in a bowl, and the milk lukewarm 
in a separate vessel ; when the sugar is dissolved 
in the wine, pour the milk in, holding it high ; 
grate nutmeg over it. 

2. Three pints of cream, half a pound of sujur, 
half a pint of wine; mix the ingredients together 
as directed in Syllabub No. 1. 



860 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

CUP CUSTARD.— NOT COOKED. 
One quart of new milk, one pint of cream, foui 
ounces of powdered loaf sugar, three tablespoons- 
ful of wine in whicli rennet has been soaked ; mix 
the milk, cream and sugar, and stir in the wine ; 
then pour into custard-cups, and set away till it 
becomes a curd; grate nutmeg on top, and eat 
with cream thoroughly cold. 

COLD CUSTARD. 

Take one-fourth of a calf's rennet, wash it well, 
cut it in pieces and put it into a decanter with one 
pint of Lisbon wine. In a day or two it will be 
fit for use. To one pint of milk add one teaspoon- 
ful of the wine ; sweeten the milk and flavor it 
with vanilla, rose-water or lemon ; warm it a little 
and add the wine, stirring it slightly ; pour it 
immediately into cups or glasses, and in a few 
minutes it will become a custard. It makes a 
firmer curd to put in the wine, omitting the 
sugar. It may be eaten with sugar and cream. 

NEW YEAR'S TRIPLE. 

This is a very pretty dish. Stick small Savoy 
or sponge cakes full of candied citron spikes, and 




PLAYI^4G GRANDMA. 



LIGHT DESSERTS, CREAMS, ETC. 361 

pour over it currant syrup or any fruit syrup pre- 
ferred diluted with the juice of a lemon ; when 
the moisture is absorbed, pour a rich cold boiled 
custard made from the yolks of eggs over the 
cake, and pile upon the top the white, beaten to a 
stiff froth, with powdered sugar, and garnish with 
bits of firm, red currant jelly. 

RASPBERRY FOOL. 

Put your fruit for quarter of an hour into an 
oven ; when tender, pulp it through a sieve, sugar 
it, add the crumbs of sufiicient sponge cake to 
thicken it ; put into a glass mould or into custard- 
cups, and lay some thick cream on the top ; if for 
immediate use, the cream may be beaten up with 
the fruit. , Other light berries and fruit may be 
treated same way. 

BLANC MANGE. 

Break one ounce of isinglass in very small 
pieces, and pour on it one pint of boiling water ; 
next morning add one quart of milk ; boil it till 
the isinglass is dissolved; strain it; put in two 
ounces of sweet almonds blanched and pounded ; 
sweeten it, and put it in the mould ; when stiff, 



362 MRS. portek's new cook-book. 

turn them into a deep dish, and put raspberry 
cream around them, or dress with syllabub nicely 
frothed ; some moulds require coloring. (For col- 
oring, see page 272.) 

TAPIOCA BLANO MANGE. 

Half a pound of tapioca soaked an hour in one 
pint of milk, and boiled till tender ; sweeten to 
taste, and put into a mould ; when cold, turn it 
out, and serve with strawberry or raspberry jam 
round it and a little cream. 

JAUNB MANGE. 

1. Dissolve one ounce and a half of isinglass 
in one pint and a half of water ; add to it one pint 
of white wine, the yolks of eight eggs and the juice 
of three lemons ; boil the peels in the liquor, beat 
the eggs with the juice of the lemons, sweeten to 
your taste ; boil it all together, strain it and put it 
into moulds. 

2. Put one ounce of isinglass, taking out a 
pinch, into a basin ; pour over it half a pint of 
boiling water ; let it stand covered over before the 
fire all night ; then put it over the fire, and make 
it hot ; add to it four yolks of eggs well beaten, 



LIGHT DESSERTS, CREAMS, ETC. 363 

Jialf a pint of sherry wine, the juice and rind of 
one lemon, sweeten it to your taste ; let it boil 
gently for quarter of an hour ; this quantity will 
make one good-sized mould. 



JACQUE MANGE. 

To two ounces of isinglass add one pint of 
water; dissolve it over the fire, and add the rind 
of two large lemons grated ; when it has boiled a 
little, put in one pint of white wine, then the yolkg 
of eight eggs thoroughly beaten, the juice of two 
lemons and sugar to taste ; the eggs, lemon-juice 
and sugar should be previously mixed together 
with a small quantity of the wine ; add the whole 
together, and keep stirring it one way until it 
boils ; then strain through muslin, and pour into 
cups or moulds that have been well rinsed in cold 
water. 

FIGS A LA GENEVIEVE. 

Dissolve two ounces of best sugar in half & 
pint of cold water in an enameled stewpan, with 
half the very thin rind of a large lemon; when 
this is done, jout into it half a pound of Turkey 
figs, and put the stewpan either over a moderate 



364 MRS. poetek's new cook-book. 

fire or on a stove, so that the figs may stew very 
slowly ; wlien quite soft, add one glassful of com- 
mon port or any other wine and the strained juice 
of half a lemon ; serve them hot for second course. 
They are very good cold for dessert. About two 
hours or two hours and a half is the average time 
for stewing the figs, and the flavor may be varied 
by using orange peel and juice instead of lemon, 
and by boiling two or three bitter almonds in the 
syrup. 



SNOW CREAM.— A VERY SIMPLE DISH. 

No sweet dish is more agreeable or easily made 
for small balls or parties than the following snow 
cream. If the recipe is closely followed, any family 
may enjoy it at a trifling expense, and it is really 
worthy the table of an epicure. Pat in a stewpan 
four ounces of ground rice, two ounces of sugar, a 
few drops of the essence of almonds or any other 
essence you choose, with two ounces of fresh 
butter ; add one quart of milk ; looil from fifteen 
to twenty minutes till it forms a smooth substance, 
though not too thick ; then pour into a mould 
previously buttered, and serve when cold and well 
Bet. If the mould be dipped in warm water, the 



LIGHT DESSEE'IS, CEEAMS, ETC. 365 

cream will turn out like a jelly. If no mould, 
put either in cups or a pie-dish. The rice had 
better be done a little too much than under. 

THE HIDDEN MOUNTAIN.— A PRETTY DISH. 

Six eggs, a few slices of citron, sugar to taste, 
three-quarters of a pint of cream, a layer of any 
kind of jam ; beat the whites and yolks of the 
eggs separately; then mix them and beat well 
again, adding a few thin slices of citron, the 
cream and sufficient pounded sugar to sweeten it 
nicely; when the mixture is well beaten, put it 
into a buttered pan, and fry the same as pancake, 
but it should be three times the thickness of an 
ordinary pancake ; cover it with jam, and garnish 
with slices of citron and holly leaves. This dish 
is served cold. 

COMPOTE AUX COMFITURES. 

Peel some apples, leave them whole, but take 
out the cores ; put a little water in the preserving- 
pan, and let the apples cook with a large lump of 
sugar, taking great care that they do not break ; 
place the apples in a glass dish, and when they 
are cold, fill the centre of each with apricot jam 

31* 



366 MHS. pouter's kew cook-book. 

or any recJierche preserve; boil the liquid until it 
jellies ; pour it into a dish that it may take its 
form, let it cool, and then put it over the apples 
"without breaking it. The French recipe adds that 
the jelly will leave the dish easily if it be dipped 
for an instant into hot water, but as this would be 
likely to dull the jelly, it is a better plan to just 
dip shape, jelly and all into cold water, a plan 
followed by good confectioners. 

ITALIAN CREAM. 

Put two pints of cream into two bowls ; with 
one bowl mix six ounces of powdered loaf sugar, 
the juice of two large lemons and two glassesful of 
white wine ; then add the other pint of cream, and 
stir the whole very hard ; boil two ounces of isin- 
glass with four small teacupsful of water till re- 
duced to one-half; then stir the isinglass luke- 
warm in the other ingredients; put them in a 
glass dish to congeal. 

BURNT CUSTARD. 

Boil one quart of milk ; when cold, mix with 
it the yolks of eight eggs ; stir them together over 
the fire a few minutes ; sweeten to your taste ; put 



LIGHT DESSERTS, CREAMS, ETC. 367 

Koaie slices of Savoy cake in the bottom of a deep 
dish, and pour on the custard ; whip the whites 
of the eggs to a strong froth ; lay it lightly on 
top ; sift some sugar over it, and hold a very hot 
iron over it until it is a light brown; garnish the 
top with raspberry marmalade or any kind of 
preserved fruit. 

FROZEN CUSTARD. 

Sweeten one quart of cream or rich milk with 
half a pound of sugar, and flavor to taste ; put it 
over the fire in a farina kettle ; as soon as it begins 
to boil, stir into it a tablespoon ful of corn-starch 
or rice flour which has been previously mixed 
smooth with a little milk ; after it has boiled a 
few minutes, take it off the fire and stir in very 
gradually six eggs which have been beaten until 
thick ; when quite cold, freeze it as ice cream. 

ORANGE SALAD. 

Take off the outer rinds and remove the thick 
inside skin of some fine, clear oranges ; slice them, 
taking out the seeds, and strew them very thickly 
with powdered sugar; drop upon this a little 
lemon juice, and over the whole pour a cupful of 
currant shrub. 



368 MUs. porter's new cook-boo:^. 

APPLE TOAST. 
Cut six apples in four quarters each ; take the 
core out, peel and cut them in slices; put in a 
saucepan one ounce of butter, then throw over 
the apples about two ounces of white pounded 
sugar and two tablespoonsfal of water; put the 
saucepan on the fire, let it stew quickly, toss them 
up, or stir with a spoon : a few minutes will do 
them ; when tender, cut two or three slices of 
bread half an inch thick, put in a frying-pan two 
ounces of butter, put on the fire ; when the butter 
is melted, put in your bread, which fry of a nice 
yellowish color ; when nice and crisp, take them 
out, place them on a dish, a little white sugar 
over, the apples about one inch thick; serve hot. 

LEMON CUP CUSTAED. 

Take four large ripe lemons and roll them; 
squeeze them in a bowl; mix with the juice a 
very small teacupful of cold water; add grad- 
ually sugar enough to make it very sweet; beat 
twelve ^eggs very light and stir into the mixture, 
beat thoroughly, put into cups, bake; grate nut- 
meg over when cold and serve ; may be eaten with 
jelly or preserves. 



LIGHT DESS£ETS, CREAMS, ETC. 3G9 

FINE ICE-CREAMS. 

Two quarts of new unskimmed milk (or good 
cream is better), two pounds (or less to taste) of 
powdered loaf sugar, eight eggs, a pinch of salt ; 
dissolve the sugar in the milk; beat the eggs to a 
froth and add to the milk and sugar ; strain and 
Bet on fire till thoroughly hot through, but not 
quite boiling : be very careful not to scorch ; flavor 
with vanilla, lemon, orange or rose to taste (below 
we give the methods for flavoring with fruits) ; 
then put it in a tin freezer, which should be not more 
than one-half full, and pack the freezer in a deep 
tub with broken ice and salt, and whirl the freezer 
rapidly till the cream has the proper consistency, 
occasionally scraping down from the inside. The 
number of eggs may be reduced to suit taste and 
purse. 

Strawberry. — Mash one pint of fresh ripe 
strawberries with a spoon ; sprinkle on half a pound 
of fine sugar and let it stand about an hour ; press 
through a fine sieve or through a cloth, and if the 
sugar is not all dissolved, stir it well in ; add a 
little water, and stir this juice into the milk or 
cream prepared as above, and freeze. 

Kaspberry. — Made the same as strawberry ; a 
delicate dish, and pink. 



370 MEs. poeter's new cook-book. 

Blackbeery. — Made tlie same as strawberry; as 
healthy a cream as made. 

Whoetlebeeey. — Made the same as straw- 
berry ; fine purple. 

Goosebeeey. — Same as strawberry ; fine green, 

E.ED CuEEANT. — Made same as strawberry; 
fine pink. 

Peach. — Take fine ripe freestone peaches ; pare, 
•chop fine, mash, and work as strawberry. 

Pine Apple. — Pare, shred fine. 

CocoANUT. — Shell, grate fine and work as straw- 
berry ; a very little lemon juice is an improvement. 

Almond. — Mash five-sixths sweet to one-sixth 
bitter almonds, putting in just enough rose-water 
to prevent oiling. 

Walnut. — Same as almond. 

Geape. — Stew not too much; sweeten while 
stewing; when cold, strain out seeds and skins. 
The Delaware and other rich sorts are best. 

Tomato. — Pare and slice very ripe tomatoes; 
sift sugar over to taste ; in preparing the milk or 
cream use rather less sugar ; a little lemon is a 
decided improvement.' 

In substantially the same way ice-cream may be 
made of almost any flavor desired. Be sure to make 
the fruit very smooth before putting it in the cream. 



LIGHT DESSERTS, CREAMS, ETC. 371 

WATER ICES. 

Orange. — Take one dozen of oranges, the skin 
grated and juice squeezed out, six quarts of water, 
ten ounces of white sugar to each quart of water ; 
mix; well and put into freezer. Be careful to stir 
steadily while freezing or it will cake into lumps 
or be crusty. A little arrowroot is considered an 
improvement by many. The amount of sugar and 
of orange juice may be varied to suit taste. 

Other flavors may be made in the same way, 
varying the flavoring to taste. 

FROZEN FRUITS. 

The above recipes, increasing quantity of peaches, 
raspberries or whatever fruit you may use, and add- 
ing a small amount of rich cream, make fine frozen 
fruits. The fruit should be mashed to a smooth 
pulp, but not thinned too much. In freezing, you 
must be especially careful to prevent its getting 
lumpy. 








GENERAL REMARKS. 

The French liave nearly, if not quite, seven 
hundred ways of dressing eggs. In this country 
we have a few hundred less, and as a rule scarce 
one well understood or practiced by the " general 
public." An egg is truly a wonderful thing — 
rich, delicate and quite full of nutriment, if 
rightly used. Its value as an article of food is 
much enhanced by the ease and quickness with 
which it can be prepared and served. 

If perfectly fresh eggs are not obtainable, great 
care should be taken in the use of doubtful ones. 
One test of their jS.tness is to drop them into cold 
water ; the stale or addled ones will float on the 
water, or at least rise on end. 



BOILED EGGS. 
The fresher eggs are, the more time will be re- 
quired for boiling ; to have them soft and tender, 



372 



HOW TO COOK EGGS. 373 

drop them in water at a boiling point, and let 
them stand from five to seven minutes, without 
boiling. If desired for salad, boil them for ten 
minutes ; then throw them in cold water ; roll 
gently on a table or board, and the shell is easily 
removed. Egg racks, to set in boiling hot water, 
are convenient. 

FRIED EGGS. 

To fry eggs to accompany ham or bacon, put 
some sweet, clean lard in a perfectly clean frying- 
pan, and when boiling hot, slip in the eggs, having 
broken each one separately in a saucer ; do not 
turn them over, but keep dipping the hot lard 
over them with an iron spoon ; they require about 
three minutes ; take them out with an egg-slice, 
trim off the discolored parts, put them on a hot 
plate, drain off the grease, and send to the table 
hot. Some place them on slices of ham. The 
whites should be transparent, so that the yolk 
will shine through. To accompany the eggs, 
slice ham very thin, and soak the slices in hot 
water for about an hour, changing tbe water 
several times, and always pouring it on boiling 
hot ; this process extracts the superfluous salt, as 
well as makes the meat tender ; after soaking, dry 

32 



374 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

the slices with a cloth and broil over a clear fire ; 
cold boiled ham may be sliced and broiled, and 
served with eggs — of course the slices need no 
soaking. Try this method, and see if it be not a 
great improvement upon the ordinary method of 
" fried " ham, and the eggs fried in the ham gravy. 



POACHED EGGS. 

To have perfect success choose eggs that are 
not less than two days old, yet they must be 
fresh ; quite fresh eggs are too milky ; the beauty 
of a poached egg, like a fried one, consists in 
having the white just sufficiently hardened to 
.form a transparent veil for the yolk; strain as 
much boiling water as you need through a clean 
cloth into a stewpan ; break the eggs separately 
into a cup or saucer, and when the water boils, 
remove the pan from the heat, and gently slip the 
eggs in ; when the white is set, replace the pan 
over the fire (which should be moderate), and as 
soon as the water boils, the eggs are done ; remove 
them with a slice and trim off the ragged edges ; 
if served on toast, cut the bread in pieces a little 
larger than the egg, and about quarter of an inch 
tliick ; toast only on one side, and just enough to 



HOW TO COOK EGGS. 375 

give a yellow color. The toast may be moistened 
with a little hot water ; some sprinkle on it a few 
drops of vinegar, lemon juice or essence of anchovy 
sauce. 

POACHED EGGS WITH HAM SAUCE. 

Mince fine two or three slices of boiled ham, a 
morsel of onion, a little parsley, pepper and salt; 
stew all together quarter of an hour; put the 
poached eggs in a dish, squeeze over them the 
juice of half an orange or lemon, and pour over 
this the sauce about half boiling. 

OMELETTES. 

A PERFECT omelette is neither greasy, burnt, 
nor overdone ; the fire should not be too hot, as it 
is an object to have the whole substance heated 
without much browning; the jDerfect omelette is 
not thin, like a piece of fried leather, but it is 
thick, in order to be full and moist ; the richness 
may be modified by beating two or three table- 
spoonsful of mashed potatoes with six eggs, or 
some corn-starch ; beat them w^ell with a fork or 
egg-beater and add a saltspoonful of salt; put two 
ounces of butter in the frying-pan ; when melted, 



376 MES. porter's new cook-book. 

pour in the beaten eggs, stir with a spoon until it 
begins to set, then turn it up all around the edges, 
and when it is of a nice brown, it is done ; to take 
it out, turn a hot plate over the omelette, and turn 
the pan upside down ; double it over like a turn- 
over, and serve hot ; if not sufficiently brown on 
the top, brown with a salamander or a heated 
shovel; to have the omelettes particularly fine, 
about as many whites as yolks should be used. 
Omelettes are sometimes served with gravy, which 
should be flavored with sweet herbs and onions, 
and thickened with potato, corn-starch or arrow- 
root; never with wheat flour. Omelettes are 
called by the name of what is added to give them 
flavor — a ham or tongue omelette, a veal kidney 
omelette (which is a great favorite with a French- 
man, on account of its delicacy) ; after the kidney 
is boiled, cut it into and beat with the eggs ; in 
the same manner, ham, anchovies or tongue, shred 
small, makes a delicately flavored dish ; some onion, 
parsley or a clove of eschalot minced very finely ; 
some chop oysters. 




M Mcv/.TO MAKE 

GENERAL REMARKS. 

This head includes Coffee, Tea, etc., and Light 
Wines, Beer, etc. To many persons a really good 
cup of coffee at their morning meal is not only a 
luxury but at the same time an essential part of 
the meal, and yet there are few, even among the 
most expert housewives, who quite understand the 
art; nothing but repeated efforts and constant 
care can give proficiency, though the instructions 
below will be found a valuable help. Tea, too, is 
often spoiled in the making; the quantity of tea 
used is important, but the manner of making is 
more so. 

For dinner, lunch and at evening social com- 
panies home-made wines, beer, etc., are often found 
convenient and acceptable, and are far safer and 
preferable to the wines, cordials, brandies and 
other alcoholic stuffs which have done such in- 
calculable harm and are so pernicious and baneful 
in the family circle.

378 MES. porter's new cook-book. 

TEA. 

Take sufficient tea, green or black or mixed, to 
taste; moisten in cold water; strain off the cold 
water and put the moist leaves in your tea-pot 
(earthen is best) and pour on boiling water; let it 
stand a few minutes near enough to the fire to 
keep hot, but not to boil at all ; then pour off into 
a warm clean pot. 



COFFEE. 

Never buy your coffee ground, but grind it 
yourself immediately before using it; keep your 
coffee-pot, whatever kind you may use, wiped 
clean and dry inside; a damp tea or coffee-pot 
acquires a musty flavor that spoils the best tea or 
coffee. Put your freshly ground coffee into the 
coffee-pot previously made warm, and pour water 
upon it actually boiling; set the pot on the fire 
for a few seconds, but do not let it boil up, then 
pour a cupful out and return it back again to the 
pot in order to clear it ; having done this let it 
stand on the hob or centre to settle, and in less 
than five minutes a transparent, strong, aromatic 
cup of coffee may be poured out. The propor- 
tions of coffee (which should not be too finely 



HOW TO MAKE BEVERAGES. 370 

ground) recommended, are an ounce to a pint or 
pint and a half of water. 

The milk used with coffee should always be 
boiled and used as hot as possible; the boiling of 
milk imparts a peculiar and exceedingly pleasant 
flavor to the coffee. White sugar is recommended, 
as the molasses-like flavor of moist sugar quite 
overpowers the delicate aroma. 

SUBSTITUTES FOR COFFEE. 

Those who are not particular as to quality, but 
only want something that looks like coffee, will 
find the following among the best of the many 
subtitutes ; Eoasted acorns, chick peas, beans, rye, 
cocoa shells, burned wheat bread, dried and roasted 
turnip, carrot and dandelion root. We do not 
recommend any substitute. 

STRAWBERRY DRINK. 

Put to one pint of water one pound of straw- 
berries, which you are to bruise or mash in the 
water; then put in quarter of a pound or five 
ounces of sugar, and squeeze into it the juice of a 
lemon, and suffer it to cool before you drink it. 
If the lemon be full, it will serve two pints. 



380 MES. portee's new cook-book. 

CHOCOLATE. 
Chip one small square of chocolate, such as are 
marked on the half pounds ; put this into a bowl, 
pour some boiling water, and mix it very smooth ; 
then put it into a kettle or sauce-pan, and add to 
it one pint of boiling water ; let it boil a few min- 
utes, then add half a pint of boiling milk ; boil the 
whole ten or fifteen minutes longer. 



COCOA. 

Geind one teacupful of cocoa in a coffee-mill ; 
put it in a small bag made of very thin muslin, 
tie it close ; put it in a pot with three half pints 
of boiling water and one pint of boiling milk ; 
boil the whole for half an hour, then put it into 
a.nother pot and send it to table. 

This will be found to suit delicate stomachs 
better than chocolate, as it is not so rich. 



BOTTLED LEMONADE. 

Take two quarts of hot water, two lemons, 
sliced, half a pound of loaf sugar and quarter of 
an ounce of gum arable ; strain through a flannel 
bag and bottle off. 



HOW TO MAKE BEVERACJES. 381 

SODA WATER POWDERS. 
Take one ounce of tartaric acid, one and a half 
ounces of carbonate of soda; divide it into sixteen 
portions, wrap up the acid in white paper and the 
joda in blue; dissolve the soda in a tumblerful of 
water, put in the acid, and drink immediately. 
Citric acid may be used instead of the tartaric, and 
will be found an improvement. 



SODA WATER. 

Dissolve one ounce of the carbonate of soda in 
one gallon of water ; put it into bottles, in the 
quantity of a tumblerful or half a pint to each ; 
having the cork ready, drop into each bottle half 
a drachm of tartaric or citric acid in crystals; 
cork and wire it immediately, and it will be ready 
for use at any time. 



APPLE ADE. 

Slicf some apples, put them in a deep pan and 
pour enough boiling water over them to cover 
them ; place the cover on the pan, and when cold, 
strain the liquid ; sweeten it, and flavor with a 
little lemon.

ORANGEADE. 
A PLEASANT and antiseptic and anti-diarrhcea 
Bumnier beverage is tlius composed : Take of dilute 
sulphuric acid, contrated infusion of orange-peel, 
each twelve drachms, syrup of orange-peel five 
fluid ounces; add same to two imperial gallons of 
water. A large wineglassful is taken for a draught, 
mixed with more or less water, according to taste. 
Try it. 

CRANBBBRYADB. 

Pour boiling water upon bruised cranberries, 
let them stand for a few hours, strain off the 
liquor and sweeten to the taste. This forms an 
agreeable and refreshing beverage. 

CREAM BEER. 

Two and one- fourth pounds of white sugar, two 
ounces of tartaric acid, juice of one lemon and 
three pints of water; boil together five minutes; 
when nearly cold, add the whites of three eggs 
beaten to a froth, half a cupful of flour well 
beaten with the egg and half an ounce of winter- 
green essence or any other kind preferred ; bottle, 
and keep in a cool place.

LEMONADE. 
Hrx lemons, one quart oi boiling water, one or 
two ounces of clarified sugar. 



TOMATO BEER. 

A VERY healthy and palatable beer can be made 
in this wise : Gather ripe, sound tomatoes; mash, 
strain through a coarse linen bag, and to every 
gallon of juice add one pound of good, moist 
brown sugar ; let it stand nine days ; pour off and 
bottle closely; the longer kept the better. When 
used, fill nearly full a pitcher with sweetened 
water, add lemon juice to suit taste, and to thia 
some of the preparation described, and you will 
find it equal to the best lemonade. To half a 
gallon of sweetened water add one tumblerful of 
beer. 

BLACK OR WHITE ELDER WINE. 

Gather the elderberries ripe and dry, pick 
thom and bruise them with your hands and strain 
them ; set the liquor by in glazed earthen vessels 
for twelve hours to settle; put to every pint of 
juit'-e one pint and a half of water, and to every 
gallon of this liquor three pounds of moist sugar , 



BS4 MRS. I'ohtek's new cook-book. 

set it in a kettle over the fire, and when it is 
ready to boil, clarify it with the whites of f(»ur or 
five eggs; let it boil one hour, and when it is 
almost cold, work it with strong ale yeast, and 
hirii it, filling up the vessel from time to time 
?vith the same liquor, saved on purpose, as it sinks 
by working. In a month's time, if the vessel holds 
about eight gallons, it will be fine and fit to bottle, 
and after bottling will be fit to drink in twelve 
months ; but if the vessel be larger, it must stand 
longer in proportion, three or four months at least 
for a hogshead. All liquors must be fined before 
they are bottled, or else they will grow sharp and 
ferment in the bottles. Add to every gallon of 
this liquid one pint of strong mountain wine, bat 
not such as has the borachio or nag's-skin flavor. 
This wine will be very strong and pleasant. 

Home-made wine may be made in a similar 
way with other berries or fruit substituted for the- 
elderberries. 



GINGER BEER. 

Put into any vessel two gallons of boiling water^ 
two pounds of common loaf sugar, two ounces of 
best ginger (bruised), two ounces of cream of tar»

tar, or else a lemon sliced ; stir them up until the 
sugar is dissolved, let it rest until about as warm 
as new milk, then add two tablespoonsful of good 
yeast, pour on to a bit of bread put to float on it ; 
cover the whole over with a cloth, and suffer it to 
remain undisturbed twenty-four hours ; then strain 
it, and put it into bottles, observing not to put 
more in than will occupy three-quarters full ; 
cork the bottles well, and tie the corks, and in two 
days, in warm weather, it will be fit to drink. If 
not to be consumed until a week or a fortnight 
after it is made, a quarter of the sugar may be 
spared. 

In substantially the same way beer may be 
made of any desired flavor by using the appro- 
priate fruit, etc. 



CIDER KEPT SWEET ALL THE WINTER. 

Bruise one pound of white mustard seed and 
add two eggs well beaten and one pint of fresh 
milk ; when the cider is in a condition for drink- 
ing, pour in the above mixture, shake the barrel 
well and bung tightly; the cider can be used 
when it settles. This recipe has been found to 
answer the purpose.

MULLED ALE. 
Boil one quart of good ale with some nutmeg ; 
beat up six eggs and mix them with a little cold 
ale ; then pour the hot ale to it, and return it sev- 
eral times to prevent it curdling; warm, and stir 
it till sufficiently thick ; add a piece of butter or a 
glass of brandy, and serve it with dry toast. 

CHERRY BOUNCE. ^ 

Mix together six pounds of morello cherries 
and six pounds of large black-heart cherries ; put 
them in a wooden bowl and mash them with a 
pestle to mash the stones; mix with the cherries 
three pounds of loaf sugar and put them into a 
demijohn or large stone jar ; pour on two gallons 
of best rectified whisky; stop the vessel closely 
and let it stand three months ; shake it every day 
the first month ; at the end of three months it is 
fit for use.

GENERAL REMARKS. 

The best method to jDreserve fruit with all its 
original flavor is by hermetically sealing it from 
the air in cans prepared for the purpose, and these 
should be of glass or stoneware, as the acids of 
fruit act chemically on tin or other metals, often 
destroying the flavor of the fruit, and sometimes 
rendering it very unwholesome. Either self-seal- 
ing cans, or those which require wax, may be used 
successfully, but probably the former are best for 
those of little experience, and they are unquestion- 
ably more convenient. Of these there are several 
claimants for public favor, all of them highly re- 
commended, and doubtless all of them good. Our 
own experience favors the "Valve Jar," Ihe 
"Mason" and the "Hero." 

The Selection of Fruit. — This should be 
done with the greatest care. Some varieties can- 
not be preserved at all, unless canned when per- 

S87 



388 MRS. POETEH'S NEW COOlt-BOOK. 

fectly fresh, and success is more certain with all 
kinds if this particular is regarded. The fruit 
should be nearly or quite ripe, but not over-ripe, 
and any which bears signs of decay must be care- 
fully excluded. 

Cooking the Feuit. — Nearly all varieties are 
better steamed than stewed or boiled, and this for 
three reasons : 1. The fruit is not so badly broken 
and mashed ; 2. It retains more of its original 
flavor ; 3. Little or no water is required to be 
added, and it is therefore cooked in its own juice. 

Almost every family has conveniences for steam- 
ing on a small scale, either with the common tin 
steamer or the elevated platform, which can be 
used in a common kettle. To those who wish for 
more ample facilities we would recommend the 
following cheap and simple method : Take a com- 
mon wash-boiler, and have fitted into it a hori- 
zontal platform of sheet-iron, perforated freely 
with half-inch holes so as to allow the free passage 
of steam. Have it mounted upon legs so it will 
Btand clear from the water, which should be only 
a few inches deep in the bottom of the boiler. 

Have your fruit carefully picked over and 
placed in a clean tin or earthen dish, with a 
cover over it to prevent the condensed steam from 



HOW TO CAN FRUITS. 389 

dropping into it. No sugar is required with any 
kind of fruit. We are informed by one who is 
always successful in this business that the flavor 
of the fruit is better preserved without sugar, and 
she ne-ver lost a can. If sugar must be used, it 
can be added when the cans are opened foi? the 
table. 

Place your dish of fruit on the platform of your 
steamer, having sufficient water in the bottom, but 
not too much. Then cover the whole closely, and 
steam until thoroughly scalded. Some kinds of 
fruit require a longer time than others, and judg- 
ment must be exercised in regard to the matter. 
It should not be cooked so as to fall to pieces, but 
care should be taken to have it thoroughly scalded. 

While the fruit is cooking, the cans should be 
prepared. Several methods have been recom- 
mended, but perhaps the following is the best: 
Have your cans thoroughly cleansed, and pour 
into each a small quantity of tepid water. Shake 
thoroughly until the can is of a uniform tempera- 
ture. Then add a little warm water, shaking as 
before; then a little hot water, and so on until the 
can is hot. This is one of the best safeguards 
against breakage, and nearly as expeditious as 

any method. This should be done just in time, 
33 • 



890 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

so that the cans will be all ready for tlie fruit aa 
soon as done. While placing the fruit in the 
cans be careful to protect them from currents 
of air, as they are frequently broken by a simple 
draught of cold air. 

The fruit may now be poured into the cans. 
Peaches, pears, or other large fruit, may be tastily 
arranged in the cans with a fork, piece by piece, and 
the boiling juice added afterward to cover them. 
When the can is full, shake it, and incline it 
back and forth, so as to cause the air to rise to 
the top, if any should be among the fruit. Be 
sure that the can is full to the brim, and then 
screw on the cover, or if not a self-sealing can, 
put in the cork and cover with melted sealing 
wax. The following recipe makes good wax: 
One pound of rosin, two ounces of beeswax, one 
and a half ounces of mutton tallow. Melt and 
mix. 

All the above work should be performed expe- 
ditiously. The cans may then be set away to 
cool, and should be kept in a cool, dark place 
and closely watched for a few days, to see that the 
sealing is perfect. If the fruit shows signs of not 
being perfectly sealed, it should be at once taken 
out, scalded and sealed again, 




HOUSEHOLD PETS. 



HOW TO CAN FRUITS. 



391 



Tomatoes, berries and small fruits may be pre- 
served in stone jugs. Observe the same rules in 
preparation, heating the jugs thoroughly before 
putting in the fruit. When filled, place one or 
two thicknesses of cloth over the mouth and then 
put in the cork, covering the whole with wax. 

By close attention to particulars and the exer- 
cise of good judgment, success is almost certain. 

ANOTHER METHOD. 

The following is recommended by a neighbor 
who has had much successful experience : To can 
peaches, I allow half a pound or less of sugar to 
one pound of peaches. Make a syrup of the sugar 
by adding a pint of water to one pound of sugar, 
and boiling for a time. Pare and halve the peaches ; 
drop them into the syrup and boil for ten minutes. 
Put into the cans— glass ones— and seal tightly. 
Any other kind of fruit may be preserved in the 
same manner. They will keep equally well with- 
out sugar, but it is usually quite as convenient to 
add the sugar when canned. Some add a few 
peach kernels blanched. For convenience and 
safety's sake, place the can, being filled with hot 
fiuit, on a wet napkin or towel folded a number 



392 MES. poetee's new cook-book. 

of times. Some varieties of pears require longer 
cooking, while some other varieties of fruit need 
less. The cans should be filled to the top. 



CANNED GRAPES. 

Theee is no fruit so difficult to can nicely as 
the grape; by observing the following instruc- 
tions you will find the grapes rich and tender a 
year from putting up. Squeeze the pulp from the 
skin, as the seeds are objectionable ; boil the pulp 
until the seeds begin to loosen, having the skins 
boiling in a little water, hard, as they are tough. 
When the pulp seems tender, put it through the 
sieve; then add the' skins, if tender, with the 
water they boil in, if not too much. We use a 
large cofieecupful of sugar for a quart can ; boil 
until thick, and can in the usual way. 





Jellies 



GENERAL REMARKS. 

In selecting fruit for preserves it should always 
be the finest and least defective, and much care 
taken to remove all the bruised or decayed parts ; 
by allowing them to remain they darken the syrup, 
and consequently the beauty of the preserve is 
lost. The best loaf sugar should always be used, 
unless for immediate use; it requires less skim- 
ming, and is not so apt to ferment. The Russian 
isinglass, as also the white of egg, may be used for 
clearing. The former should be prepared some 
hours previous to using by pouring boiling water 
over and allowing it to stand until wanted. 

Glass tumblers are decidedly preferable to larger 
vessels for all kinds of jellies and preserves, for 
by frequent opening they very soon spoil. A 
paper well saturated with brandy should be placed 
on each, and a thick piece pasted over the top to 
exclude the air. They should always be kept in 
a dry, cool place.

394 MES. porter's new cook-book. 

SYRUP FOR PRESERVES. 
To every pound of sugar add one gill of water, 
and let it stand until it is dissolved. For every 
twelve pounds of sugar allow half an ounce of 
Kussian isinglass. Dissolve the isinglass by pour- 
ing over it a little boiling water. Put it in with 
the sugar ; when cold, place the whole over the 
fire, and as soon as it begins to boil, skim it until 
no more scum will rise. The syrup is then ready 
for any kind of fruit which you may wish to 
preserve. 

PINE APPLE PRESERVES. 

Choose your pine apples as ripe as you can gel 
them. Pare and cut them into thin slices, weigh 
them, and allow one pound of the best double- 
refined loaf sugar to each pound of fruit. Take a 
deep china bowl or dish, and in it put a layer of 
fruit and sugar alternately, observing to put a 
coating of sugar on the top, and let it stand all 
night. 

In the morning take out the fruit and put the 
syrup into a preservin«-kettle. Boil and skim it 
until it is perfectly clear ; whilst it is boiling hot 
pour it over the fruit, and let it stand uncovered 
until it becomes entirely cold. 



PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 393 

If it is covered, the steam fulls into the syrup 
and thins it. Put your fruit in glass jars or tum- 
blers, and cover it close by pasting paper over the 
(op. 

PEACH PRESERVES. 

Take fine large peaches, pare them and remove 
the pits. Weigh the fruit, and allow an equal 
quantity of the best loaf sugar. Put the peaches 
into a large dish and strew one-half of the sugar 
over them. Cover the dish and let it stand till 
next morning. Then take all the juice from the 
fruit, put it into a preserving-kettle with the re- 
maining sugar, and when it is cold, put in some 
isinglass or the white of egg beaten. 

In like manner quince, plum, apricot, apple, 
cherry, green gage and other fruit preserves are 
made; in every case fine large fruit should be 
taken, free from imperfections, and the slightest 
bruise or other fault should be removed. 

CRANBERRY PRESERVES. 

Pick, wash and weigh your cranberries; to 
each pound of fruit allow a pound of sugar. Dis- 
solve the sugar in as small a quantity of water as 



396 MEs. poktee's new cook-book. 

possible; put it over the fire in a preserving- 
kettle, let it boil, and skim until it is perfectly 
clear; then put in your cranberries, boil them 
until they are quite soft and clear. Pour them 
warm into your glasses; paste or tie paper over 
when cold. 

TOMATO PRESERVES. 

Wash, bruise them and put in a boiler over a 
fire; boil half an hour and strain; boil the juice 
until reduced one-half; cool, put in jars, and seal ; 
then place the jars in a boiler of cold water, with 
straw or rags to prevent breakage; boil twenty 
minutes ; when perfectly cold, place the jars in a 
cool, dark cellar. They will keep for years. Add 
seasoning when brought on the table. 

WATERMELON RIND PRESERVES. 

Select your rind, firm, green and thick ; cut 
them in any fanciful shape, such as leaves, stars, 
diamonds, etc. When cut, weigh, and to eaclj 
pound of rind allow one and a half pounds of 
loaf sugar. To green them take a brass or 
copper kettle, and to a layer of grape vine leaves, 
which should be well washed, add a layer of the 



PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC* 397 

rind, and so on until the last, which should be a 
thick layer of the leaves and well covered with a 
coarse linen cloth. To each pound of the rind 
add a piece of alum the size of a pea; then fill up 
with warm water sufficient to cover the whole, and 
let it stand upon the stove, where it will steam, 
but not boil, until the greening is completed, 
which will be in two or three hours. When green, 
lay them in clear, cold water and commence your 
syrup. To each pound of sugar add one and a 
half pints of water; clarify, put in your rind; 
have ready sliced some lemons, two to each pound 
of rind, and when about half done, add the lemons. 
Boil until the rind is perfectly transparent. If 
you like the taste of ginger, add a few pieces of 
the root, which will impart a high flavor, and is 
very pleasant when blended with the lemons. 
This preserve when candied is a very good sub- 
Btitute for citron in fruit cake and juince pies. 



GABDEN CITRON PRESERVES. 

After having cut your citron in fanciful 

shapes, place them in a jar of salt water and let 

them remain three days and nights, then in fresh 

water two days and nights, and the same length 
u 



398 MRS. poeter's new cook-book. 

of time in alum water. Scald them well in the 
alum water, drop them into fresh water, and let 
them remain one night, then boil in fresh water 
until transparent ; cover them while boiling Wxih 
grape leaves. Then make a syrup, allowing two 
pounds of loaf sugar to one of citron, and boil like 
preserves. 

BLACKBERRY JAM. 

Choose large blackberries which are fully ripe, 
weigh them and allow one pound of sugar to a 
pound of fruit. Mash the fruit and sugar to- 
gether; put the whole in a preserving-kettle; 
skim it while boiling, and stir it frequently ; let it 
boil about one hour; v/hen done, put in small 
pots or glasses, and when it becomes cold, cover 
with brandy paper and paste or tie them close. 

WHOLE STRAWBERRY PRESERVES. 

Choose the largest scarlet strawberries, not too 
ripe For every pound of fruit weigh a pound of 
double-reiined sugar. Spread the fruit on large 
dishes and sprinkle over it half the sugar finely pul- 
verized ; shake the dish gently, so that the sugar 
may come in contact with the under side of the fruit 



PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 399 

On tlie following day make a thin syrup with the 
remaining half of the sugar, and allow one pint 
of red currant juice to every three pounds of 
strawberries. Mix the sugar and currant juice 
together, and in this syrup simmer the straw- 
berries until sufficiently jellied. When done, 
place them in small glasses; when cold, cover 
with brandied paper, and tie or paste paper over 
each to exclude the air. 

PUMPKIN PRESERVES. 

Select a thick yellow pumpkin, take off the 
rind and cut it into pieces of any form you may 
fancy. Weigh the pumpkin, and for each pound 
of fruit take a pound of loaf sugar. Allow one 
wineglassful of lemon juice for each pound of 
sugar ; put the sugar over the pumpkin and pour 
the juice over the whole. Cover it, and let it 
stand all night. The next day add the parings 
of one or two lemons, according to the quantity of 
fruit, and boil the pumpkin long enough to make 
it tender and clear, without being broken. Take 
out the fruit, place it on broad dishes to cool. 
Put it in jars or tumblers, and pour the syrup 
over; when cold, cover with brandy paper and 
lie close, or paste paper over. 



400 MES. POETEE^S 2TEW COOK-BOOK. 

QUINCE MARMALADE. 

Choose very ripe quinces ; wash, pare and core 
them ; to each pound of fruit allow one pound of 
loaf sugar. Boil the parings and cores together, 
with water enough to cover them, till quite soft ; 
strain the liquid into the preserving-kettle with 
the fruit and sugar. Boil the whole over a slow 
fire, stirring it frequently until it becomes a thick 
mass. When cold, put in tumblers or glass jars. 
Cover with brandy paper and tie or paste paper 
over each, and keep in a dry, cool place. 

Other fruit marmalades are made in like manner 



ORANGES IN JELLY. 

Take the smallest sized oranges ; boil them in 
water until a straw will easily penetrate them; 
clarify half a pound of sugar for each pound of 
fruit ; cut them in halves or quarters, put them 
into the syrup, and simmer them until the fruit 
becomes clear ; then take out the oranges and put 
them into a deep dish. Stir into the syrup an 
ounce or more of Bussian isinglass, and let it boil 
a short time; if the syrup should not be thick 
enough, put in sufficient isinglass. As soon as you 
have a perfect jelly, strain it hot over the oranges. 



PHESEHVES, JELLIES, ETC. 401 

PEACH JAM. 
Let your peaches be quite ripe, pare and cut 
tliem in small pieces ; to every pound of fruit add 
one pound of sugar ; put the fruit and sugar into 
a preserving-kettle, mash all together, place it 
over the fire, and when it begins to cook, stir it 
until it becomes quite thick. Then take it from 
the fire, put it in glasses, and when cold, tie 
closely. 

CRANBERRY JELLY. 

Take two ounces of isinglass, boil it in one pint 
of water ; when cold, mix with it double its quan- 
tity of cranberry juice. To every pint of this 
mixture add one pound of double refined sugar, 
and boil until it jellies. If for immediate use, 
rinse your forms with cold water, pour in the 
jelly while warm, and when perfectly cold it will 
turn out readily. 

APPLE JELLY. 

Pare, core and slice your apples ; place them 
in a pan, and pour in water enough t) cover 
them ; stew them gently until they are s' ft, then 
turn them into a jelly -bag ; let all of tl fc syrup

402 MEs. porter's new cook-book. 

run ihrougli without pressing it; then to each 
pint of this juice put one pound of loaf sugar and 
boil it to a jelly. 

CALF'S FEET JELLY. 

Wash and prepare one set of feet, place them 
in four quarts of water, and let them simmer 
gently five hours. At the expiration of this time, 
take them out and pour the liquid into a vessel to 
cool. When cold, remove every particle of fat, 
replace the jelly into the preserving-kettle, and 
add one pound of loaf sugar, the rind and juice 
of two lemons; when the sugar has dissolved, 
beat two eggs with their shells in one gill of 
water, which pour into the kettle, and boil five 
minutes, or until perfectly clear ; then add one 
gill of Madeira wine, and strain through a flannel 
bag into any form you like. 

ORANGE SYRUP. 

Pare the oranges, squeeze and strain the juice 
from the pulp. To one pint of juice allow one 
pound and three-quarters of loaf sugar. Put the 
juice and sugar together, boil and skim it until it 
is clear ; then strain it through a flannel bag, and 



PRESERVES, JELLIES, ETC. 403 

let it stand until it becomes cool, then put in bot- 
tle? and cork tight. 

Lemon syrup is made in the same way, except 
that you scald the lemons and squeeze out the 
juice; allow rather more sugar. 



STRAWBERRIES IN WINE. 

Stem the finest and largest strawberries; put 
them into wide-mouthed pint bottles. Put into 
each bottle four large tablespoonsful of pulverized 
loaf sugar; fill up the bottles with Madeira or 
Sherry wine. Cork them closely, and keep them 
in a cool place. 



BRANDY PEACHES. 

Take large juicy freestone peaches, not so ripe 
as to burst or mash on being handled. Kub off 
the down from every one with a clean thick flan- 
nel. Prick every peach down to the stone with a 
large silver fork, and score them all along the 
Beam or cleft. To each pound of peaches allow a 
pound of double-refined loaf sugar, broken up 
small, and half a pint of water mixed with half a 
white of egg, slightly beaten. Put the sugar into 



404 MEs. portee's new cook-book. 

a porcelain kettle and pour the water upon it. 
When it is quite melted, give it a stirring, set it 
over the fire, and boil and skim it till no more 
«cum rises. Next put in the peaches, and let 
Lhera cook (uncovered) in the syrup till they look 
clear, or for about half an hour, or till a straw will 
penetrate them. Then take the kettle off the fire. 
Having allotted a pint of the very best white 
brandy to each pound of peaches, mix it with the 
Byrup, after taking out the fruit with a wooden 
spoon and draining it over the kettle. Put the 
peaches into a large tureen. Let the syrup re- 
main in the kettle a little longer. Mix the 
brandy with it, and boil them together ten min- 
utes or more. Transfer the peaches to large glass 
jars (two-thirds full), and pour the brandy and 
syrup over them, filling quite up to the top. 
When cool, cover them closely and tie some 
bladder over the lids. 

GREEN GAGES 

Are brandied in the same manner. Also large 
egg-plums. Pears, also, having first peeled them. 
To pear sweetmeats always add lemon rind grated 
Mid lemon juice. 







GENERAL REMARKS. 
This important department of cookery requires 
but little instruction beyond the two essential 
points — be careful to select perfectly sound fruit 
or vegetables for pickling, and use none but tlie 
very best cider vinegar. Good white wine vinegar 
does well for some sorts of pickles, but be ever 
watchful against chemical preparations called 
vinegar, that destroy instead of preserving the 
articles put away in it. In the selection of spices 
there is so much diversity of taste that no general 
directions will be of practical value. Do not use 
brass or copper kettles. 



CUCUMBER PICKLES. 

Wash your cucumbers very clean; make a 
pickle of salt and water sufficiently strong to 
float an egg, and pour it over them. Put a 
weight on the top of the vessel to keep the 

405 



406 MRS. poetee's new cook-book. 

cucumbers under the brine, and let them stand 
nine da3^s; then take them out and wash them in 
fresh Avater. Line the bottom of your kettle with 
green cabbage leaves, put in your pickles and as 
much vinegar and water, mixed in equal quan- 
tities, as \nl\ cover them. Put a layer of cabbage 
leaves on the top. Hang them over a slow iire ; 
let the water get hot, but do not allow them to 
simmer, as that would soften them. When they 
are perfectly green, take them out and let them 
drain. Wipe them dry, put them in jars with 
some allspice, cloves and a few small onions or 
cloves of garlic. A piece of alum in each jar 
will keep them firm. Cover your pickles with 
the best cider vinegar ; tie them close and keep 
them in a cool, dry place. By adding one table- 
spoonful of sugar it will be found a great im- 
provement. 

PICKLED MANGOES. 

Wash your mangoes and rub them until thoy 
are smooth. Cut a piece out of the side of each 
one, take out all the seeds ; then replace the piece 
and tie it closely with a thread. Make a iDickle 
of salt and water strong enough to float an egg. 
Put in the mangoes, and place a cover over them 



HOW TO MAKE PICKLES. 407 

and a weight upon it, in order to keep them en- 
tirely under the brine. Let them remain nine or 
ten days; then take them out and wash them in 
clear water. Line the bottom of your kettle witli 
leaves, put in your mangoes, cover them with 
water and put a layer of cabbage leaves over 
them ; place them over a slow fire, keep them 
scalding hot, but do not let them simmer. As 
soon as they become of a fine green, take them 
out and wipe them dry. Stir together some 
scraped horseradish, mustard seed, cloves, allspice, 
coriander seed and garlic ; fill your mangoes with 
this mixture, tie on the piece again and lay them 
in the jars with the cut side up. A little sugar 
may be added to the vinegar, of which pour over 
a sufficient quantity to cover the pickles. Tie 
them closely. 

They are not fit for use until they become soft. 



PICKLED PEPPERS. 

To one hundred peppers put three half pints of 
fait and as much scalding water as will cover them. 
Tt is best to put a weight over to keep them under 
the water. Let them remain in the salt and water 
two days ; then take them out and let them drain. 



408 MES. portek's new cook-book. 

Make a small opening in the side to let out the 
water. Wipe them, put them in a stone jar with 
half an ounce of cloves, half an ounce of allspice 
and a small lump of alum. Cover them with cold 
vinegar. 
When done in this way they do not change color. 

ONION PICKLES. 

Select small white onions, put them over the 
fire in cold water with a handful of salt. When 
the water becomes scalding hot, take them out 
and peel off the skins, lay them in a cloth to dry ; 
then put them in a jar. Boil half an ounce of 
allspice and half an ounce of cloves in a quart of 
vinegar. Take out the spice and pour the vinegar 
over the onions while it is hot. Tie up the jar 
when the vinegar is cold, and keep it in a dry 
place. 

CHOU CHOU. 

To one peck of green tomatoes add three good- 
eized onions, six peppers with the seeds taken out ; 
chop together, and boil three minutes in three 
quarts of vinegar. Throw this vinegar away 
after straining. Then to three quarts of new 
vinegar, when scalding hot, add two cupsful of 



HOW TO MAKE PICKLES. 409 

sugar, one cupful of mixed mustard, one table- 
spoonful of cloves, one tablespoonful of allspice, 
two tablespoonsful of cinnamon, three tablespoons- 
ful of salt Pour over the tomatoes hot. 

PICKLED PEACHES. 

TiKE hard ripe peaches, wipe off the down, 
stick a few cloves in them, and lay them in cold 
spiced vinegar. In three months they will be fit 
for use. 

PICKX-ED RED CABBAGE. 

Slice it into a colander, and sprinkle each 
layer with salt ; let it drain two days, then put it 
into a jar and pour boiling vinegar enough to 
cover, and put in a few slices of red beet-root. 
Observe to choose the purple red cabbage. Cauli- 
flower cut in bunches, and thrown in after being 
salted, will look of a beautiful red. 

PICKLED MUSHROOMS. 

Rub the buttons with flannel and salt, throw 
them in a stewpan, with a little salt over them ; 
sprinkle them with some pepper and a small 
quantity of mace ; as the liquor comes out shake 

S5 



410 MRS. porter's jtew cook-book. 

them well, and keep tliem over a gentle fire until 
all is dried into them again ; then put as much 
vinegar into the pan as will cover them ; give it a 
scald, and pour the whole into bottles. 

WALNUTS. 

They must be gathered when young enough to 
prick with a pin readily ; pour on them boiling 
salt and water, and let them remain covered with 
it nine days, changing it every three days ; take 
out and lay on dishes in open air a few minutes, 
taking care to turn them over; this will make 
them black sooner ; put them in a pot ; strew over 
them some whole peppers, cloves, a little garlic, 
mustard seed and horseradish scraped and dried. 
Cover with strong cold vinegar. 

INDIA PICKLE. 

Fifteen old cucumbers; pare, seed and cut 
llirm in thin strij^s; spread them on a board 
fitrewn thickly with salt; let them stand twelve 
hours; then expose them to the sun, turning 
until perfectly dry, avoiding the night air ; wash 
them in vinegar ; put a layer of mustard seed, 
Qnions, a stick of grated horseradish, Simmer ip 



HOW TO MAKE PICKLES. 411 

one quart of vinegar, half an ounce of tumeric, 
half an ounce of race ginger (both tied in a bag); 
allspice whole, a few cloves and cinnamon. When 
cool, pour it oyer the cucumbers. 

SWEET PICKLES. 

Various fruit, such as peaches, plums, cherries, 
grapes, etc., are very nice sweet pickled. The 
process is the same as for other light pickles, 
except you sweeten the vinegar to taste. Water- 
melon rind makes a nice sweet pickle ; flavor with 
green ginger. 

TOMATO CATSUP. 

Wash and boil one bushel of tomatoes. When 
soft, pass the whole through a colander, mashing 
the mass till it has ceased to drip. There will be 
about eleven quarts of juice. Put this in a china- 
lined kettle, and add four tablespoon sful of salt, 
two tablcspoonsful of allspice, three of ground mus- 
tard, one and a half teaspoonsful of ground black 
pepper, one of cayenne. Boil this two hours ; if 
you wish it thick, three or four hours. Bottle, put- 
ting a little sweet oil on the top of each, to exclude 
air. Seal, and it is ready for use in two weeks.

Liebig's Broth for the Sick. — For one por- 
tion of broth take half a pound of freshly- killed 
meat (beef or chicken), cut it into small pieces 
and add to it one and one-eighth pounds of pure 
water to which have been added four drops of 
muriatic acid and one-half to one drachm of salt ; 
mix them well together. After standing an hour, 
the whole is strained through a hair sieve, allow- 
ing it to pass through without pressing or squeez- 
ing. The portion passing through first being 
cloudy, it is again poured through the sieve, and 
this process is repeated until it becomes perfectly 
clear. Upon the residue of meat remaining in the 
sieve, half a pound of pure water is poured, in 
small portions. In this manner, about one pound 
of liquid (cold extract of meat) is obtained, of a 
red color and a pleasant meat-broth taste. It is 
administered to the sick, cold, by the cupful, ac- 
cording to their inclination. It must not be heated, 
as it becomes cloudy thereby, and a thick coaguluro

id deposited. A great hindrance to the employ- 
ment of this broth is, in summer, its liability to 
ciiange in warm weather ; it commences regularly 
to ferment, like sugar water with yeast, without 
the usual odor. On account of this, the meat 
must be extracted with perfectly cold water and 
in a cool place. Ice water and refrigeration with 
ice completely remove this difficulty. Most im- 
portant of all is it that the meat should be 
perfectly fresh. This broth is now in use in 
the hospitals, and in the private practice of sev- 
eral of the most distinguished physicians of 
Munich. 

A Vegetable Soup. — Take an onion, a turnip, 
two pared potatoes, a carrot (a head of celery or 
not) ; boil them in three pints of water till the 
vegetables are cooked ; add a little salt ; have a 
slice of bread, toasted and buttered, put into a 
bowl, and pour soup over. When in season, toma- 
toes, or okra, or both, improve this. . 

Gum Water. — Half an ounce to one ounce 
'lissolved in one quart of cold water. Sweeten it. 

Coffee. — Sick persons should have their coffee 
made separate from the family, as standing in the 
tin pot spoils the flavor. Put two teaspoonsful of 
ground coffee in a small mug, and pour boiling 

3a* 



414 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

water on it ; let it set by the fire to settle, and 
pour it off in a cup, with sugar and cream. 
Care should be taken that there are no burnt 
grains. 

Chocolate. — To make a cup of chocolate, grate 
a large teaspoonful in a mug, and pour a teacu]>ful 
of boiling water on it ; let it stand covered by the 
fire a few minutes, when you can put in sugar and 
cream. 

Black Tea. — Black tea is much more suitable 
than green for sick persons, as it does not affect 
the nerves. Put a teaspoonful in a pot that will 
hold about two cupsful, and pour boiling water 
on it. Let it set by the fire to draw five or ten 
minutes. 

Rye Mush. — This is a nourishing and light 
diet for the sick, and is by some preferred to 
mush made of Indian meal. Four large spoonsful 
of rye flour mixed smooth in a little water, and 
stirred in a pint of boiling water; let it boil 
twenty minutes, stirring frequently. Nervous 
persons who sleep badly rest much better after 
a supper of corn or rye mush than if they take 
tea or coffee. 

Boiled Custard — Beat an egg with a heaped 
teaspoonful of sugar; stir it into a teacupftil of 



COOKERY FOR THE SICK. 4l5 

boiled milk, and stir till it is thick ; poui \t in a 
bowl on a slice of toast cut up, and grate a little 
nutmeg over. 

Panada. — Put some crackers, crusts of dry 
bread or dried rusk in a saucepan "with cold 
water and a few raisins; after it has boiled half 
an hour, put in sugar, nutmeg, and half a glass of 
wine if the patient has no fever. If you have 
dried rusk, it is a quicker way to put the rusk in 
a bowl with some sugar, and pour boiling water 
on it out of the tea-kettle. If the patient can 
take nothing but liquids, this makes a good drink 
when strained. 

Barley-Water. — Well wash two ounces of 
pearl barley ; boil it a few minutes in half a pint 
of water, which is to be thrown away ; thea add 
four pints of boiling water; keep it bo\liDg 
till two only are left, and strain. A small quan- 
tity of lemon-juice may be added. 

Mucilaginous Broth. — Cut a young fowl into 
geveral parts, and wash them thoroughly ; put 
these into a three-quart stewpan ; add Ihreo

to the surface. After the broth has thrown off 
the albumen of the meat in the shape of scum, 
add to it two ounces of best Ceylon moss, taking 
care to mix well the moss with the broth ; keep it 
gently boiling for one hour and a quarter ; skim 
it for use. This broth is very nutritious and cool- 
ing, and will prove beneficial in cases of sore 
throat. 

Plain Chicken Broth. — Cut into four parts 
a young fowl, wash them and put them into a 
stewpan with one quart of water and a little salt ; 
set it to boil ; skim it well, and then add the heart 
of a white cabbage lettuce and a handful of cher- 
vil ; boil the broth an hour, and then strain it for 
use. 

Beef Tea. — Two pounds of the lean of beef; 
pare away carefully every portion of fat, skin or 
sinew, cut it into pieces the size of a nut ; put it 
into a stewpan that will hold two quarts, and 
pour three pints of boiling water upon it ; add a 
little salt ; when it boils, skim it, and then remove 
it to the side of the stove to boil gently for an 
hour ; skim it for use. 







aENERAL REMARKS. 

It is an economy to use the very best sugar for con- 
fectionery in general, for when highly refined it needs 
little or no clarifying, even for the most delicate pur- 
poses ; and the coarser kinds lose considerable weight 
in the process. Break the sugar into large lumps, and 
put it into a very clean preserving-pan ; measure for 
each pound a pint of spring water if it be intended for 
syrup, but less than half that quantity for candying or 
making barley-sugar. Beat first apart (but not to a 
strong froth), and afterwards with the water, about 
half the white of an egg for six pounds of sugar, unless 
it should be veri/ common sugar, when twice as much 
may be used. When they are well mixed, pour them 
over the sugar, and let it stand until it is nearly dis- 
solved ; then stir the whole thoroughly, and place it 
over a gentle fire, but do not disturb it after the scum 
begins to gather on the top ; let it boil for five minutes, 
then take the pan from the fire, and when it has stood 
a couple of minutes clear off the scum entirely with a 
skimmer ; set the pan again over the fire, and when

the sugar begins to boil throw in a little cold water, 
which has been reserved for the purpose from the 
quantity first measured, and repeat the skimming until 
the syrup is very clear; it may then be strained 
through a muslin, or a thin cloth, and put into a clean 
pan for further boiling. 

For Syetjp : Sugar, 6 lbs ; water, 3 quarts ; | white 
of an egg. For candying, etc, : Sugar, 6 lbs. ; water, 
2| pints ; 5 to 10 minutes. 

TO BOIL SUGAR FROM SYRUP TO CANDY, OR TO 
CARAMEL. 

After having boiled a certain time, the length of 
which will in a measure depend upon the quality of the 
sugar as well as the quantity of water added, it becomes 
a thin syrup, and it will scarcely form a short thread if 
a drop be pressed between the thumb and finger and 
they are then drawn apart ; from five to ten minutes 
more of rapid boiling will bring it to a thick sjrrup, and 
when this degree is reached the thread may be drawn 
from one hand to the other at some length without 
breaking ; but its appearance in dropping from the 
skimmer will perhaps best denote its being at this point, 
as it hangs in a sort of string as it falls. After this the 
sugar will soon begin to whiten, and to form large bub- 
bles in the pan, when, if it be intended for barley-sugar, 
or caramel, some lemon juice or other acid must be 
added to it, to prevent its graining or becoming sugar

again ; but if wanted to candy, it must be stirred with- 
out ceasing, until it rises almost to the top of the pan, 
in one large white mass, when it must be used immedi- 
ately ov ladled out into paper cases or on to dishes, 
with the utmost expedition, as it passes in an instant 
almost from this state to one in which it forms a sort 
of powder, which will render it necessary to add water, 
to stir it until dissolved, and to reboil it to the proper 
point. For barley-sugar likewise it must be constantly 
stirred, and carefully watched after the lemon juice is 
added. A small quantity should be dropped from time 
to time into a large basin of cold water by those who 
are inexperienced in the process ; when in falling into 
this it makes a bubbling noise, and if taken out imme- 
diately after it snaps clean between the teeth without 
sticking to them, it must be poured out instantly : if 
wanted for sugar-spinning, the pan must be plunged as 
quickly as possible into a vessel of cold water. 

BARLEY-SUGAR. 

Add to three pounds of highly-refined sugar one pint 
and a quarter of spring water, with sufficient white of 
e<rg to clarify it in the manner directed in the last 
receipt but one : pour to it, when it begins to whiten 
and to be very thick, a dessert spoonful of the strained 
juice of a fresh lemon ; and boil it quickly till it is at 
the point which we have indicated above. A few drops 



420 MRS. POflTEn's NEW COOK-BOOK. 

of essence of lemon may be added to it, just as it is 
taken from the fire. Pour it on to a marble slap, or on 
to a shallow dish which has been slightly oiled or rub- 
bed witli a morsel of fresh butter ; and when it begins 
to harden at the edges, form it into sticks, lozenges, 
balls, or any other shapes at pleasure. While it is still 
liquid it may be used for various purposes, such as 
Chantilly baskets, palace bon-bons, etc. ; for these the 
vessel containing it must be set into a pan of water, 
and it must again be liquified with a very gentle degree 
of heat should it cool too quickly. As it soon dissolves 
if exposed to damp, it should be put into very dry can- 
isters as soon as it is cold, and these should be kept in 
a dry place. 

Best sugar, 3 lbs. ; water, 1^ pints ; white of egg^ \ of 
1 ; lemon-juice, 1 dessert spoonful. 

GINGER-CANDY. 

Break a pound of highly-refined sugar into lumps, 
put it into a preserving-pan, and pour over it about the 
tliird of a pint of spring water ; let it stand until the 
sugar is nearly dissolved, then set it over a perfectly 
clear fire, and boil it until it becomes a thin syrup. 
Have ready in a large cup a teaspoon ful of the very 
best ginger in powder, mix it smoothly and gradually 
with two or three spoonfuls of the syrup, and then stir 
it well into the whole. Watch the mixture carefully, 



HOW TO MAKE CONFECTIONERY. 421 

keep it stirred, and drop it often from a spoon to ascer- 
tain the exact point of boiling it has reached. When 
it begins to fall in flakes, throw in the freshly-grated 
rind of a very large lemon, or of two small ones, and 
work the sugar round quickly as it is added. The 
candy must now be stirred constantly until it is done ; 
this will be when it falls in a mass from the spoon, and 
does not sink when placed in a small heap on a dish. 
It must be poured, or ladled out, as expeditiously as 
possible when ready, or it will fall quite into powder. 
If this should happen, a little water must be added to 
it, and it must be reboiled to the proper point. The 
candy, if dropped in cakes upon cold dishes, may be 
moved off without difficulty before it is thoroughly 
cold, but must not be touched while quite hot or it will 
break. 

Sugar, highly-refined, 1 lb.; water, ^ of a pint; gin- 
ger, 1 teaspoonful ; rind of 1 large lemon. 

ORANGE-FLOWER CANDY. 

Beat in three-quarters of a pint, or rather more, of 
water about the fourth-part of the white of an egg ; and 
pour it on two pounds of the best sugar broken into 
lumps. When it has stood a little time, place it over 
a very clear fire, and let it boil for a few minutes, 
then set it to one side, until the scum has subsided ; 
clear it off, and boil the sugar till it is very thick, then 

36* 



422 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

strew in by degrees three ounces of the petals of the 
orange-blossom, weighed after they are picked from 
their stems. Continue to stir the candy until it rises 
in one white mass in the pan, then pour it into small 
paper cases, or on to dishes, and follow for it precisely 
the same directions as are given for the ginger-candy 
in the preceding receipt. The orange-flowers will turn 
brown if thrown into the syrup too soon : it should be 
more than three parts boiled when they are added. 
They must be gathered on the day they are wanted for 
use, as they soon become discolored from keeping. 

Sugar, 2 lbs.; water, f pint; ^ white of an egg', 
orange-blossoms, 3 ozs. 

PALACE-BONBONS. 

Take some fine fresh candied orange or lemon peel, 
take off the sugar that adheres to it, cut it into inch- 
squares, stick these singly on the prong of a silver fork, 
or on osier-twigs, dip them into liquid barley-sugar, and 
place them on a dish rubbed with the smallest possible 
quantity of very pure salad oil. When cold, put them 
into tin boxes or canisters well dried, with paper be- 
tween each layer. 

EVERTON TOFFIE. 

Put into a brass skillet, if at hand, three ounces of 
very fresh butter, and as soon as it is just melted add a 



HOW TO MAKE CONFECTIONERY. 423 

pound of bi'own sugar of moderate quality ; keep these 
stirred gently over a very clear fire for about fifteen 
minutes, or until a little of the mixture, dropped into a 
basin of cold water, breaks clean between the teeth 
without sticking to them: when it is boiled to this 
point, it must be poured out immediately, or it will 
burn. The grated rind of a lemon, added when the 
toffie is half done, improves it much ; or a small tea- 
spoonful of powdered ginger, moistened with a little of 
the other ingredients, as soon as the sugar is dissolved, 
ar»d then stirred to the Avhole, will vary it pleasantly to 
many tastes. The real Everton toffie is made with a 
much larger proportion of butter, but is the less whole- 
some on that account. If dropped upon dishes first 
rubbed with a buttered paper, the toffie when cold can 
be raised from them easily. 

Butter, 3 ozs. ; sugar, 1 lb. ; 15 to 18 minutes. 

TOFFIE (with Almonds. ) 

Boil together a pound of sugar and five ounces of 
butter for twenty minutes ; then stir in two ounces of 
almonds blanched, divided, and thoroughly dried in a 
slow oven, or before the fire. Let the toffie boil after 
they are added, till it crackles when dropped into cold 
water, and snaps between the teeth without sticking. 

Sugar, 1 lb. ; butter, 5 ozs. ; almonds, 2 ozs. ; 20 to 
30 minutes.

What to set before guests at the table, or, indeed, 
before one's own family, is sometimes a perplexing 
matter for housekeepers to decide ; therefore a few- 
timely hints may prove of advantage to every prudent 
housekeeper. 

Endeavor to secure varietj'-, and avoid extravagance, 
taking care not to have two dishes alike, or nearly 
alike, such as ducks and pork, veal and fowls ; and 
avoid, when several sorts are required, to have such 
things as cannot "be eaten cold, or cannot be warmed 
or recooked. There is a great waste occasioned if these 
principles are overlooked in providing for a party. 
When a table is to be set out, it is usual to place nearly 
the whole of the provisions at once ; but if comfort is 
tlie object, it is better to have each dish and its accom- 
panying sauces and vegetables sent in separately, hot 
from the kitchen. 

For plain family dinners, soup or pudding is placed 
at the head of the table, and meat at tlie lower end ; 
vegetables on each side of the middle, and sauce boats 
in the middle. Boiled meat at the top; roast meat 

426 



HOW TO SET OUT A TABLE. 427 

at the bottom ; soup in the middle ; then the vegetables 
and sauce boats at cross corners of the middle dish. 
Poultry or mutton at bottom ; boiled poultry at top ; 
roast poultry, or game, at bottom; vegetables and 
sauces so disposed as to give the appearance of the 
whole table being covered without being crowded. 

When there are several courses, the first consists of 
soups, stews, boiled fish, fricassees; poultry with ham, 
bacon, tongue, or chine ; and roast or boiled meat. 

For second course, birds and game of all sorts, fish 
fried, pickeled, or potted ; pigeon pies, patties, brawn, 
omelets, oysters stewed or scolloped, and lobster or 
crabs. Tarts, cheesecakes, and sweet dishes of all 
kinds, are sometimes placed with the second course, 
but more frequently form separate courses by them- 
selves. 

The dessert is usually served in ar.other room, which 
is a great accommodation both to the servants, who can 
prepare it at leisure, and to the guests in quitting the 
smell of a hot dinner. A d'oyley, a finger-glass, two 
wine-glasses, a china dessert plate, and silver knife and 
fork, and spoon to each person. Every variety of fruit, 
fresh and preserved, is admissible ; and biscuits, and 
pound-cake, with an epergne or stand of jellies in the 
middle. Varieties of wine are generally placed at each 
end. 

The modern practice of dining late has added im- 
portance to the luncheon, and almost annihilated the 



428 MES. pokter's new cook-book. 

supper meal. The following are suitable for either : 
soups, sandwiches of ham, tongue, dried sausage, or 
beef; anchovy, toast or husks ; potted beef, lobster, or 
cheese ; dried salmon, lobsters, crayfish, or oysters, 
poached eggs ; patties ; pigeon-pies ; sausage ; toast 
with marrow (served on a water-plate), cheesecakes ; 
puffs, mashed or scoUopped potatoes, brocoli ; asparagus, 
seakale with toast, creams, jellies, preserved or dried 
fruits, salad, radishes, etc. If a more substantial sup- 
per is required, it may consist of fish, poultry, game ; 
slices of cold meat, pies of chickens, pigeons, or game, 
lamb or mutton chops, cold poultry, broiled with high 
seasoning, or fricasseed ; rations or toasted cheese. 

A great part of a company dinner can be prepared 
the day before. The vegetables can be prepared and 
put in cold water, the game or meat be larded, the 
meat or fish cooked for croquettes and salads, the salad 
dressing made ready, and jellies, creams and cold pud- 
dings be made. If a clear soup (and that is always 
best) is to be served, it also should be made. In the 
morning the bread and cake can be baked, and the fish 
and other dishes prepared. Early in the afternoon 
freeze the creams and sherbets. 

Make a list of the principal dishes. With each dish 
have a list of the vegetables, sauces or other things to 
be served, and the time for serving. This will insure 
the dishes being ready at the proper moment. Have 
the plates and other dishes counted and ready to warm 



HOW TO SET OUT A TABLE. 429 

— and, by the way, arrange to have these and the silver 
washed where the noise will not reach your guests. 



GARNISHES. 

The dishes on which meats, fish, jellies and creams 
are placed should be large enough to leave a margin of 
an inch or so between the food and the lower edge of 
the border of the dish. 

It is well to pour the sauce for cold puddings around 
the pudding, especially if there will be a contrast in 
color. 

It is a great improvement to have the sauce poured 
around the article instead of over it, and to have the 
border of the dish garnished with bits of celery tops, 
parsley, or carrot leaves. 

When sauce is poured around meat or fish, the dish 
must be quite hot, or the sauce will cool quickl3\ 

Small rolls or sticks of bread are served Avith soup. 
Potatoes and bread are usually served with fish, but 
many people prefer to serve only bread. Butter is not 
served at the more elegant dinners. Two vegetables 
will be sufficient in any course. Cold dishes should be 
very cold, and hot dishes hot. 

It is a good idea to have a dish of sliced lemons for 
any kind of fish, and especiall}^ for those broiled or 
fried. 

Melons, canteloupes, cucumbers and radishes, and 



4B0 MRS. tOBTEE's KEW COOK-BOOK. 

tomatoes, when served in slices, should all be chilled in 
the ice chest. 

Be particular not to overdo the work of decorating. 
Even a simple garnish adds much to the appearance ot' 
a dish, but too much decoration only injures it. Gar- 
nishes should be so arranged as not to interfere with 
serving. 

Potato-balls and thin fried potatoes make a nice gar- 
nish for all kinds of fried and boiled meats and fish. 

Cold boiled beets, carrots and turnips, and the whites 
of hard-boiled eggs, stamped out with a fancy vegetable 
cutter, make a pretty garnish for cold or hot meats. 

Thin slices of toast, cut into triangles, make a good 
garnish for many dishes. 

Whipped cream is a delicate garnish for all Bavarian 
creams, blanc manges, frozen puddings and ice creams. 

Arrange around jellies or creams a border of any kind 
of delicate green, like smilax or parsley, or of rose 
leaves, and dot it with high colors — pinks, geraniums, 
verbenas or roses. Remember that the green should be 
dark and the flowers small and bright. A bunch of 
artificial rose leaves, for decorating dishes of fruit at 
evening parties, lasts for years. Natural leaves are 
preferable when they can be obtained. 

Wild roses, buttercups and nasturtiums, if not used 
too freely, are suitable for garnishing a salad. 




A great saving is made by the proper care and use of 
cooked and uncooked food. The first and great con- 
sideration is perfect cleanliness. The ice chest and 
cellar should be thoroughly cleaned once a week ; the 
jars in which bread is kept must be washed, scalded 
and dried thoroughly at least twice a week. When 
cooked food is placed in eitiier tlie ice chest or cellar it 
should be perfectly cool ; if not, it will absorb an un- 
pleasant flavor from the close atmosphere of either 
place. Meat should not be put directly on the ice, as 
the water draws out the juices. Always place it in a 
pan, and this may be set on the ice. When you have 
a refrigerator where the meat can be hung, a pan is not 
needed. In winter, too, when one has a cold room, it is 
best to hang meats there. 

These remarks applj^, of course, only to joints and 
fowl. The habit which many people have of putting 
steaks, chops, etc., in the wrapping paper on ice, is a 
very bad one. When purchasing meat always have 
the trimmings sent home, as they help to make soups 
and sauces. Every scrap of meat and bone left from 



4^^ iviES. porter's neW CooK-£Ooii. 

roasts and broils should he saved for tlie soup-pot. 
Trimmings from ham, tongue, corned beef, etc., should 
all be saved for the many relishes they will make. 
Cold fish can be used in salads and warmed up in many 
palatable ways. In fact, nothing that comes on the 
table is enjoyed more than the little dishes which an 
artistic cook will make from the odds and ends left from 
a former meal. By an artistic cook is meant not a 
professional, but a woman who believes in cleanliness 
and hot dishes, and that there is something in the ap- 
pearance as well as in the taste of the food, and who does 
not believe that a quantity of butter, or of some kind 
of fat, is essential to the success of nearly every dish 
cooked. The amount of food spoiled by butter, good 
butter too, is surprising. 

One should have a number of plates for cold food, 
that each kind may be kept by itself. The fat trim- 
mings from beef, pork, veal, chickens and fowl should 
be tried out while fresh, and then strained. The fowl 
and chicken fat should be kept in a pot by itself, for 
shortening and delicate frying. Have a stone pot for it, 
holding about a quart, and another, holding three or 
four quarts, for the other kinds. The fat that has 
been skimmed from soups, boiled beef and fowl, should 
be cooked rather slowlj' until the sediment falls to the 
bottom and there is not the shadow of a bubble. It 
can then be strained into the jar with the other fat ; 
but if strained while bubbles remain, there is water in 



UTILES FOR THE PEOrER CARE OF FOOD. 433 

it, and it will spoil quickly. The fat from sausages can 
also be strained into the larger pot. Another pot, 
holding about three quarts, should be kept for the fat 
in which articles of food have been fried. When you 
have finished frying, set the kettle in a cool place for 
about half an hour ; then pour the fat into the pot 
through a fine strainer, being careful to keep back the 
sediment, which scrape into the soap-grease. In this 
way you can fry in the same fat a dozen times, while if 
you are not careful to strain it each time, the crumbs 
left will burn and blacken all the fat. Occasionally, 
when you have finished frying, cut up two or three un- 
cooked potatoes and put into the boiling fat. Set on 
the back of the stove for ten or fifteen minutes ; then 
set in a cool place for fifteen minutes longer, and strain. 
The potatoes will clarify the fat. 

Many people use ham fat for cooking purposes ; and 
when there is no objection to the flavor, it is nice for 
frying eggs, potatoes, etc. But it should not be used 
with other kinds of food. The fat of mutton, lamb, 
geese, turkey or ducks will give an unpleasant flavor to 
anything with which it is used, and the best place for 
it is with the soap-grease. Every particle of soup and 
gravy should be saved, as a small quantity of either adds 
a great deal to many little dishes. The quicker food 
of any kind cools the longer it keeps. This should be 
particularly remembered with soups and bread. 

Bread and cake must be thoroughly cooled before be-

4S4 Mrs. ^oIiter's new cook-boo^. 

ing put into box or jar. If not, the steam will cause 
them to mould quickly. Crusts and pieces of stale bread 
should be dried in a slow oven, rolled in fine crumbs on a 
board, and put away for croquettes, cutlets, or anything 
that is breaded. Pieces of stale bread can be used for 
toast, griddle-cakes and puddings, and for dressing for 
poultry and other kinds of meat. Stale cake can be made 
into puddings. 

The best tub butter will keep perfectly well without 
a brine if kept in a cool, sweet room. It is more health- 
ful and satisfactory to buy the choicest tub butter and 
use it for table and cooking purposes than to provide a 
fancy article for the table and use an inferior one in the 
preparation of the food. If from any cause, butter be- 
comes rancid, to each pint of it add one table-spoonful 
of salt and one teaspoonful of soda, and mix well ; then 
add one pint of cold water, and set on the fire until it 
comes to the boiling point. Now set away to cool, and 
when cool and hard, take off the butter in a cake. 
Wipe dry and put away for cooking purposes. It will 
be perfectly sweet. 

Milk, cream and butter all quickly absorb strong odors ; 
therefore, care must be taken to keep them in a cool, 
sweet room or in an ice ch.est. Cheese should be wrap- 
ped in a piece of clean linen and kept in a box. Berries 
must be kept in a cool place, and uncovered.

Adopt the plan of rising early, and never sit up late 
at night. 

Wash the whole body every morning with cold water, 
by means of a large sponge, and rub it dry with a rough 
towel, or scrub the whole body for ten or fifteen min- 
utes with flesh brushes. 

Those who use cold water regularly, either with a 
sponge or as a bath, are able to bear exposure to the 
weather much better than without its aid. 

Drink water generally, and avoid taking spirits, 
wines, and all fermented liquors. 

Sleep in a room that has free access to the open air, 
and is well ventilated. 

Keep the head cool by washing it with cold water if 
necessary, abate feverish and inflammatory symptoms 
when they arise, by preserving stillness.

HOW TO PllESERVE HEALTH. 437 

and never sit in a draught, or in wet clothes, nor lie in 
a damp bed. 

Exercise regularly taken, tends to preserve the health. 
Walk one or two miles a day, regardless of weather, 
unless very bad indeed. Even a lady with stout walk- 
ing boots, a large thick cloak, and an umbrella, may 
defy bad weather. 

In taking exercise in very severe weather, keep 3-our 
mouth closed and walk rapidly ; the air can only reach 
the lungs by a circuit of the nose and head, and be- 
comes warm before reaching the lungs, thus causing no 
derangement. Brisk walking throws the blood to the 
surface of the body, thus keeping up a vigorous circula- 
tion, making a cold impossible, if you do not get into a 
cold bed too quickly after reaching home. Neglect of 
these precautions brings sickness and death to multi- 
tudes every year. 

The amount of exercise necessar}^ for health is vari- 
able, depending upon natural constitution, education, 
sex, and age. For men from twenty to fifty, eight or 
ten miles a day of walking exercise may be taken as 
the average ; and for women of the same age, about 
half this quantity will suffice. Less than this will go 
a great way, but for keeping up high health, the above 
amount, omitted only on thoroughly wet days, may l-e 
considered necessary. 

By all means avoid a morbid desponding feeling, for 
scarcely any thing is more injurious to health.

Mental as well as bodily exercise is essential to the 
general health and happiness; therefore, labor and 
study should succeed each other. 

The plainest food is the best, taken in quantities so 
small as not to oppress the stomach. A man should 
never know that he has a stomach except when he is 
hungry. 

To increase muscular power, food should be taken 
which does not produce fat ; for fat is frequently a sign 
of disease. A race-horse is brought to his prime con- 
dition by a system of training. So with man, if he 
wishes to see the full development of alLhis muscular 
power, he must restrict himself in diet, and exhaust his 
fat by having a good sweating every day, but not to 
take cold. 

Lying too long in bed is injurious to health. The 
want of expansion of the cliest through exercise, will 
aggravate or create consumptive tendencies, which all 
more or less have ; and the constant heat of the back 
or one side, occasioned by cushioning, disturbs healthy 
action. 

When food rises in the stomach, the stomach is speak- 
ing to us, and we ought to listen to it, or health will 
suffer. In due time headaches will be the result ; the 
liver is oppressed, and cannot fulfill its functions. 
There has been more introduced into the body than 
can be conveniently disposed of. Every part receives 
some of the obtrusive matter; it is forced into the

absorbents ; the blood is unwillingly compelled to take 
a part of it; the brain feels the effect of the poisonous 
infusion; the circulation is impeded; the heart feels it, 
and labors hard to do its allotted work. By persisting 
ill the habit, life will be shortened. 

Too little food has its symptoms as well as too much. 
The body will flag for want of stimulus ; it will lose 
warmth and energy ; and if it be found that more food 
restores both, and brings comfort, tlien more food is 
wanted. Every one should endeavor to discover his 
own maximum and minimum allowance, and adhere to 
it. 

Those who think most, require the most sleep. The 
time " saved " from necessary sleep is destruction to 
mind, body, and estate. Give yourself, children, and 
servants, the fullest amount of sleep by compelling 
them to go to bed at some early hour, and to rise in 
the morning the moment they awake of themselves, 
and within a fortnight nature will unloose the bonds of 
sleep the moment enough repose has been secured. 

Rise and retire at a fixed hour ; take a gentle walk 
before breakfast; and take your meals at the same 
hours daily. 

The less quantity of fermented liquors you drink the 
better. 

Nothing conduces more to health and long life than 
abstinence and plain food, with due labor. 



440 ME,s. porter's new cook-book. 

Where water does not disagree value the privilege, 
and continue it. 

Late hours and anxious pursuits exhaust the nervous 
system, therefore avoid them as much as possible. 

In order that digestion may take place, the food 
should be well chewed. The stomach will not deal 
with it in lumps. It must be thoroughly masticated 
and well mixed with the saliva which flows into the 
mouth during mastication. 

Do without medicine if possible ; but in case of real 
indisposition, immediately consult a competent medical 
man. 

If the preservation of the life entrusted to us is the 
first duty of man, the keeping that life in a state of 
healthy action should be equally imperative. To do 
this effectively, the two first considerations are food and 
exercise, occupation of mind and body; ivhen to take 
this food is an inquiry that should be answered with 
the same care bestowed on the substances which con- 
stitute our aliment. The meals, then, or the sufficiency 
of food to be taken at one time, should have reference 
not only to the person's occupation, his amount of 
physical and mental labor, but to his hours of action 
and repose. 

In arranging the definite period for each meal, the 
person should calculate the number of hours between 
his rising in the morning and his retiring to bed at 
night, and then endeavor to divide this time into four 



HOW TO PKESERVE HEALTH. 441 

as nearly equal spaces as he can, and assign each as an 
hour for a meal. It will be seen by this that we advo- 
cate the old-fashioned sequence of meals in preference 
to the modern and more artificial mode of living, fully 
impressed with the belief that the first is more in ac- 
cordance with the requirements of nature, and conse- 
quently more conducive to health. The usual number 
of working hours averages from fifteen to sixteen a 
day ; perhaps the latter is more generally correct, for, 
should not the body be occupied the whole time from 
the getting up to the going to bed, the mind is ; and 
there is consequently fatigue and exhaustion. 

As the stomach usually takes from four to five 
hours to perform the process of digestion, and as that 
organ should never be allowed to remain empty for any 
length of time, these sixteen hours must be divided into 
the four periods we are about to indicate. Where un- 
avoidable employment prevents such an arrangement, 
the space from morning to night may be reduced to 
three periods, but should never fall below that ; for no 
opinion is more fallacious than that the stomach, jilted 
of its mid-day meal, can compensate itself from a richer 
and more varied repast in the evening ; or that three 
courses at six o'clock, with plenty of time to "enjoy 
them, will more than atone for a plate of roast meat 
and potatoes at one or two. The stomach, rendered 
torpid by long abstinence, will not be flattered into per- 
forming a double duty by a multiplicity of rich foods, 



442 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

in all probability as badly assorted for the purposes of 
digestion, as out of cbaracter by their Dumber and 
incongruity. 

It is also a great mistake to suppose that the break- 
fast is required as soon as the individual is out of bed ; 
the stomach then has hardly recovered from the torpid- 
ity of the night, and requires action and the free circu- 
lation of the blood, before it is in a state to perform its 
healthy function. Those, however who are obliged to 
work for two or three hours before breakfast, should 
take with them a few mouthfuls of biscuit or bread to 
eat about an hour after beginning work, so that when 
the stomach is stimulated to full action, a small amount 
of nourishment should be put in it, to give the gastric 
juice some solid on which to operate, instead of irritat- 
ing the coats of the stomach by that gnawing feeling 
known as the sense of hunger. By adopting this pre- 
caution, the organ will be in a state of vigorous activ- 
ity when, at eight or nine o'clock, the person sits down 
to his breakfast. 

Those whose labors do not commence till after their 
first meal, should be careful not to partake of it for at 
least half an hour after leaving their beds, or till the 
body has been actively excited, if not by a brief exer- 
cise, or some gymnastic feat, by a free use of the flesh- 
brush over the trunk, to excite the circulation of the 
blood. Whatever may be the occupation of the per- 
son, the breakfast should always be made the meal of 



HOW TO PRESERVE HEALTH. 443 

most importance, after the dinner, and though with the 
man of sedentary habits less substantial than that of 
the working man, should always consist of flesh-form- 
ing materials, and sufficiency in bulk to give the stom- 
ach material on which it can act for some hours. To 
induce the stomach to take in a due quantity of bread, 
or solid matter, a bloater, slice of bacon, piece of ham, 
or whatever savory article may be selected should be 
eaten with it, the object of all such relishes being 
rather to necessitate the swallowing of a large bulk of 
bread or toast, than any special benefit to be derived 
from the few mouthfuls of animal food taken. As the 
most important business of the day is usually per- 
formed in the morning and noon, whether the exercise 
is that of the mind or body, the benefit of laying up a 
store of nutriment in the stomach, to be converted into 
healthy blood as the toil of the day demands extra 
stamina, will be evident to all. 

When the breakfast has been at eight the dinner 
should be at one o'clock ; and when at nine, at two 
o'clock. The best hour for tea is about six, so as to 
leave three clear hours before the supper which should 
consist of some simple articles — bread and butter and 
oysters, or bread and cheese, with celery, and a glass of 
ale or porter, or, to those who are accustomed to its use, 
a glass of spirits and water. The idea that suppers of 
all sorts are hurtful is most absurd and unreasonable. 
Hot meat suppers — a second edition of dinner, in fact 



444 MRS. poetee's new cook-book. 

— would, to many persons, be very injurious; others, 
however, who do not go to bed for an hour after, and 
whose appetite is strong, may partake of such a repast 
with perfect impunity. Such suppers as are advocated 
here may be taken with safety, and by invalids ; nor 
will there be any fear of nightmare if the person ad- 
journs to bed within a quarter of an hour of such a 
meal. 

Exceptions of course frequently occur, not only as 
regards supper, but also as to the hours given for the 
other meals — cases where the person's stomach and his 
avocations must be consulted, and all rules made to 
submit to the state of the individual's appetite and his 
business. This rule, however, should be always ob- 
served, — that whatever hours are fixed on for the dif- 
ferent meals, those times should be rigidly adhered to, 
and the virtue of punctuality in eating faithfully ob- 
served. So great, indeed, is the influence of habit in 
this respect, that a person accustomed to dine or break- 
fast at a regular hour will always — unless in ill-health 
—feel hungry, or disposed to eat, at the recurrence 
of the time appointed. 

Where the meals follow at the short intervals of four 
or five hours, luncheon, or any intermediate eating or 
drinking, is not only uncalled for but reprehensible. 

With literary men, and those whose occupations 
perpetually tax the brain, if the day's toil can be con- 
veniently brought to a close by five, or even six 



HOW TO PHESERVE HEALTH. 445 

o'clock, it is more beneficial to take a slight repast at 
one o'clock, and delay dinner till the day's work is 
over. If, however, their occupations engage them np 
to night, the dinner should be taken at two, and an 
hour, or an hour and a half, of perfect repose taken 
after it, and before renewing their labors. To the d^s- 
peptic patient, or those suffering from habitual irrita- 
bility of stomach, and where all solid food produces 
pain, the breakfast should be preceded by a cup of hot 
coffee about half an hour before taking the meal. 

The habit of taking provocatives before dinner, in 
the shape of small quantities of brandy, or glasses of 
bitters, is very objectionable, and can only be excused 
where the stomach is cold, and the appetite naturally 
languid. In such cases, about half an ounce of the 
compound tincture of gentian, or an ounce of the com- 
pound tincture of cardamoms may, however, often be 
taken with great benefit. 

38 • 








Friendly calls should be made in the forenoon, and 
require neatness, without costliness of dress. 

Calls to give invitations to dinner-parties, or balls, 
should be very short, and should be paid in the after- 
noon. 

Visits of condolence require a grave style of dress. 

A formal visit should never be made before noon. 
If a second visitor is announced, it will be proper for 
you to retire, unless you are very intimate both with 
the host and the visitor announced ; unless, indeed, the 
host express a wish for you to remain. 

Visits after balls or parties should be made within a 
month. 

In the latter it is customary to enclose your card in an 
envelope, bearing the address outside. This ma}^ be 
sent by post, if you reside at a distance. 

But, if living in the neighborhood, it is polite to send 
your servant, or to call. In the latter case a corner 
should be turned down.

HOW TO RECEIVE AND ENTERTAIN. 447 

Scrape your shoes and use the mat. Never appear in 
a drawing-room with mud on your boots. 

When a new visitor enters a drawing-room, if it be a 
gentleman, the hidies bow slightly ; if a lady, the guests 
rise. 

Hold your hat in your hand, unless requested to place 
it down. Then lay it beside you. 

The last arrival in a drawing-room takes a seat left 
vacant near the mistress of the house. 

A lady is not required to rise to receive a gentleman, 
nor accompany him to the door. 

When your visitor retires, ring the bell for the ser- 
vant. You may then accompany your guest as far to- 
ward the door as the circumstances of your friendship 
seem to demand. 

Request the servant, during the visit of guests, to be 
ready to attend to the door the moment the bell rings. 

When you introduce a person, pronounce the name 
distinctly, and say whatever you can to make the intro- 
duction agreeable. Such as " an old and valued friend," 
" a schoolfellow of mine," " an old acquaintance of our 
family." 

Never stare about you in a room as if you were tak- 
ing stock. 

The gloves should not be removed during a call. 

Be hearty in your reception of guests ; and where 3^ou 
see much diffidence, assist the stranger to throw it oj6f. 

A lady does not put her address on her visiting card. 




The stout woman is alwaj^s asking what she shall 
wear. Now these, according to the New York /S'ww, 
are some of the things she should not wear: 

She should not wear a tailor-made suit fitting her 
figure closely. It brings out every pound of flesh for 
the benefit of the looker-on. 

She should not wear a rosette at her belt. 

She should not wear a lace or ribbon ruche about her 
neck, though the soft feather one is permissible if it 
have long ends. 

She should not wear a short skirt. 

She should not wear her hair low on her neck. 

She 'should not wear a string of beads about her neck, 
rings in her ears, or, if her fingers are short and fat, 
many rings on them. 

She should avoid high sleeves and loose gloves. 

She should shun champagne. 

She should hate ice-cream.

TO PURIFY SINKS AND DRAINS. 

To one pound of common copperas add one gallon of 
boiling water, and use when dissolved. The copperas 
is deadly poison, and should always be carefully labeled 
if kept on hand. This is one of the best possible cleans- 
ers of pipes and drains. 

TO WASH GREASY TIN AND IRON. 

Pour a few drops of ammonia into every greasy 
roasting-pan, after half filling the pan with warm water. 
A bottle of ammonia should alwa3's be kept on hand 
near the sink for such uses; never allow the pans to 
stand and dry, for it doubles the labor of washing, but 
pour in water and use the ammonia, and the work is 
half done. 



TO CLEAN CARPETS. 



Shake and beat the carpets well ; lay them upon the 
floor and tack them firmly ; then with a clean flannel

wash them over with one quart of bullock's gall mixed 
with three quarts of soft, cold water, and rub it off with 
a clean flannel or house-cloth. Any particularly dirty 
spot should be rubbed with pure gall. Carpets cleansed 
in this way look bright and fresh. 



TREATMENT OF OILCLOTH. 

Oilcloth ought never to be wetted, but merely rub- 
bed with a flannel and polished with a brush of moder- 
ate hardness, exactly like a mahogany table ; and by 
this means the fading of the colors and the rotting of 
the canvas are entirely avoided. 



FLANNELS. 

Flannels should always be washed with white soap, 
and in warm, but not boiling, water. 



DAMP CLOSETS. 

For a damp closet or cupboard, which is liable to 
cause mildew, place in it a saucerful of quicklime, and 
it will not only absorb all apparent dampness, but 
sweeten and disinfect the space. Renew the lime once 
a fortnight ; if the place be very damp, renew it as often 
as it becomes slaked. Lime may be used in the same 
way for water-closets and out-buildings. 




CHANCES ARE EXCELLENT. 



THINGS EVERY HOUSEItEEt»ER SMOULt) KNOW. 451 
DAMP WALLS. 

Line the damp part of the wall with sheet lead, 
rolled very thin, and fastened up with small copper 
nails ; it may be immediately covered with paper, and 
so hidden from view. The lead is not to be thicker 
than that which lines tea chests. 

WHITEWASH FOR ROOMS. 

Take four pounds of whiting and two ounces of com- 
mon glue ; let the glue stand in cold water over night, 
then heat it until dissolved and pour it hot into the 
whiting mixed with cold water. This makes a nice, 
smooth whitewash. 

WHITEWASH THAT WILL NOT RUB OFF. 

Mix up half a pailful of lime and water ready to put 
on the wall ; then take one-fourth pint of flour, mix it 
with water, then pour on it a sufficient quantity of boil- 
ing water to thicken it, and pour it while hot into the 
whitewash ; stir all well together and use. 

PAINTING AND PAPERING. 

Painting and papering are best done in cold weather, 
especially the former, for the wood absorbs the oil of 
paint much more in warm weather, while in cold 
weather the oil hardens on the outside, making a coat 
which will protect the wood instead of soaking into it. 



452 MKS. porter's kew cook-book. 

MILK PAINT. 

Mix water lime with skim-milk to proper consistency 
to apply with brush, and it is ready for use ; it will ad- 
here well to wood, smooth or rough, to brick, mortar, 
or stone, where oil has not been used, and it forms a 
very hard substance as durable as the best of paint ; 
any color which is desirable may be had by using colors 
dissolved in whisky. 



TO CLEAN BRASS. 

Finely-rubbed bichromate of potassa, mixed with 
twice its bulk of sulphuric acid and an equal quantity 
of water, will clean the dirtiest brass very quickly. 



TO CLEAN BRICKS. 

To remove the green that gathers on bricks, pour 
over them boiling water in which any vegetables, not 
greasy, have been boiled ; repeat for a few days and 
the green will disappear. For the red wash, melt one 
ounce of glue in one gallon of water ; while hot, add 
alum the size of an egg, one-half pound Venetian red, 
one pound Spanish brown ; if too light, add more red 
and brown ; if too dark, water. By experimenting, the 
color desired may be had. 



THINGS EVERY HOUSEKEEPEE SHOULD KNOW. 463 
TO POLISH NICKEL PLATE. 

Scour with pulverized borax ; use liot water and very 
little soap ; rinse in hot water, and rub dry with a clean 
cloth. By this quick process a bright polish may be 
had. 

CEMENT FOR BROKEN CHINA OR GLASS. 

Dissolve one-half ounce of gum arabic in a wine-glass- 
ful of boiling water ; add plaster-of-paris sufiBcient to 
form a thick paste, and apply it with a brush to the 
broken parts ; being nearly colorless, it is better than 
liquid glue or other cements. 

TO CLEANSE BRASSES, TINS, COPPERS, ETC. 

Mix rotten-stone, soft soap, and oil of turpentine to 
the consistency of stiff putty. The articles should first 
be washed with hot water to remove grease ; then rub 
the metal with the mixture, mixed with a little water ; 
then rub off briskly with a dry, clean rag or leather, 
and a beautiful and durable polish will be obtained. 

TO REMOVE IRON STAIN FROM MARBLE. 

Wet the spots with oil of vitriol, or oxalic acid di- 
luted in alcohol, or with lemon juice, and after a quarter 
of an hour, rub them dry with a soft linen cloth. 



454 MRS. poktee's new cook-book. 

TO CLEAN MARBLE. 

Use three ounces of pearl ash, one pound of whiting, 
and three pints of water well mixed together, and boil 
for ten minutes ; rub it well over the marble and let it 
remain twenty-four hours, then rub it off, and dry with 
a clean cloth. 

Td CLEAN WOODWORK. 

Where painted wainscot or other woodwork requires 
cleaning, fuller's earth Avill be found cheap and useful, 
and, on wood not painted, it forms an excellent substi- 
tute for soap. Where extreme nicety is required, use 
a mixture of one pound of soft soap, two ounces of 
pearl ash, one pint of lard, and one pint of table beer ; 
simmer these substances in a pipkin over a slow fire, 
and let them be well mixed. The mode of application 
is to put a small quantity in flannel ; rub it on the 
wainscot, wash it off with warm water and dry thor- 
oughly with a linen cloth. This will clean painted 
woodwork without removing the paint. 

TO CLEAN GILT FRAMES. 

When the gilt frames of pictures or looking-glasses, 
or the gilt mouldings of rooms have specks of dirt 
upon them, from flies or other causes, they can be 
cleaned with the white of an egg gently rubbed on with 
a camel-hair pencil. 



THINGS EVERY HOUSEKEEPER SHOULD KNOW. 455 
TO CLEAN PICTURE FRAMES. 

Black walnut frames will become dull and rusty look- 
ing. They may be renewed by first brushing thor- 
oughly with a stiff brush to remove dust, and then ap- 
plying pure linseed oil with a proper brush, or Avith a 
piece of new bleached muslin. 



TO REMOVE MOTHS FROM FURNITURE. 

Moths may be exterminated or driven from uphol- 
stered work by sprinkling this with benzine. The ben- 
zine is put in a small watering pot, such as is used for 
sprinkling house-plants ; it does not spot the most deli- 
cate silk, and the unpleasant odor passes off in an hour 
or two in the air. Care must be used not to carry on 
this work near a fire or flame, as the vapor of benzine 
is very inflammable. It is said that a little spirits of 
turpentine added to the water with which floors are 
washed will prevent the ravages of moths. 



PERFUME AND A PREVENTIVE AGAINST MOTHS. 

Take one ounce of Tonquin beans, carraway seed, 
cloves, mace, nutmeg, cinnamon, well ground ; add six 
ounces of Florentine orris root ; mix well, and put in 
Ibags among your clothes, 



456 MRS. porter's new cook-book. 

TO BLACKEN HEARTHS. 

Mix black lead and whites of eggs well beaten 
together ; with a painter's brush wet the hearth thor- 
oughly all over ; then rub it bright with a hard brush. 

TO REMOVE FLY SPOTS. 

Dip a camel-hair brush into spirits of wine, and apply 
it to remove fly spots. 

MUCILAGE. 

An excellent mucilage may be made by taking one 
ounce of gum tragacanth, as much corrosive sublimate 
as will lay on a silver five-cent piece ; put it into a jar 
and pour over it one quart of cold, soft water; let it 
stand twenty-four hours ; then stir, and it is ready for 
Use, and it will keep as long a time as is desired. 

LIQUID GLUE. 

Dissolve 33 parts of best glue, in a steam bath, in 86 
parts of water ; then add gradually, stirring constantly, 
B parts of nitric acid, or enough to prevent hardening 
when cool. 

HOW TO KEEP MEAT. 

Meat is much better for family use when at least one

with the cut end up, the reverse of the usual way, and 
the juice will remain ia the meat and not run to the cut 
and dry up by evaporation. 

TO RESTORE AND PRESERVE FLOWERS. 

Faded flowers may be generally more or less restored 
by immersing them half way up their stems in very 
hot water, and allowing them to remain in it until it 
cools, or they have recovered. The scalded portion of 
the stem must then be cut off, and the flowers placed 
in clear, cold water. In this way a great number of 
faded flowers may be restored ; but there are some of 
the more fugacious kinds on which it proves useless. 
Flowers may also be preserved and their tints deepened 
by adding to the water a little solution of carbonate of 
ammonium and a few drops of phosphate of sodium. 
The effect of this, in giving tlie flowers a deeper color 
and a stronger appearance, is quite wonderful; and, by 
cutting off every other day about half an inch of the 
stems of the flowers with a sharp knife, they may be 
kept as long as their natural life would last in the fields 
or woods.

TO CLEAN HAIR BRUSHES. 

Dissolve a piece of soda in some hot water, allowing 
a piece the size of a walnut to a quart of water ; put 
the water into a basin, and, after combing out the hair 
from the brushes, dip them, bristles downward, into the 
water and out again, keeping the backs and handles as 
free from water as possible. Repeat this until the 
bristles look clean ; then rinse the brushes in a little 
cold water ; shake them well, and wipe the handles and 
backs with a towel, hut not the bristles, and set the 
brushes to dry in the sun, or near the fire. Wiping the 
bristles of a brush makes them soft, as does also the use 
of soap. 



TO CLEAN COMBS. 

If it can be avoided, never wash combs, as the water 
often makes the teeth split, and the horn, if wet, often 
becomes rough. A small brush can be bought made 
purposely for cleaning combs ; with this the comb 
should be well brushed, and afterwards wiped with a 
cloth.

BANDOLINE, 

Soak starch, or Irish moss (whichever is handy) in 
rose water until dissolved and smooth ; if you wish it 
to be pink, color it with a little pounded cochineal. 

OIL OF ROSES FOR THE HAIR. 

Attar of roses one drachm, oil of rosemary one 
drachm, olive oil one quart, mixed together. It may 
be colored red by steeping a little alkanet root in the 
oil (with heat) before scenting it. 

MILK OF ROSES. 

Put into a small bottle two ounces of rose water, one 
teaspoonful of oil of sweet almonds, ten drops of oil of 
tar. Shake the bottle until the whole is combined ; it 
makes a nice and perfectly harmless cosmetic to apply 
to the skin after washing. 

MARROW POMADE FOR THE HAIR. 

^Marrow a quarter pound, lard a quarter pound, castor 
oil six ounces, salad oil six ounces, palm oil half ounce ; 
scent with oil of bergamot ; melt the lard and palm oil 
together, then strain it, and strain the marrow ; mix all 
well together, until nearly cold and put in pots.

CHILBLAINS. 

Wash the chilblains with tincture of myrrh diluted

BURNS. 

Lime water beaten up with sweet oil is an excellent 
ointment for painful burns. 

SPRAINS. 
Sal ammoniac half an ounce, rose water half pint, 
cologne water a tablespoonful. Rags wet with the lo- 
tion should be laid on the injured part, and changed 
when they get dry. 

SUNBURN. 
This may occur in grade from a slight reddening of 
the face to an inflammation attended with blistering. 
Soothing applications and avoiding the cause are the 
indications. Oxide of zinc ointment, cosmoline and 
zinc ointment, in equal parts, or dusting powders of 
starch or rice flour, are useful. A solution of subni- 
trate of bismuth, or bicarbonate of soda, has some 
value for removing freckles. Powdered nitre, moist- 
ened with water and applied to the face night and 
morning, has also been recommended for removing 
freckles. 




HOW TO MAKE THEM GROW. 



1. Keep them clean — out of the dust if possible — 
with plenty of pure air, water, and sunshine. Do not 
have any regular " times " for watering them. Judge 
by the surface soil whether they are thirsty. Their 
need of moisture varies with the temperature of the 
room and the strength of the sunlight. 

2. Water thoroughly so as to feed the roots well. A 
great deal of moisture is lost in the percolation of wa- 
ter to the base of a deep crock. When this is well 
done, wait till the surface soil is dry and pawdery be- 
fore saturating again. 

3. Use rain-water if you can get it. Hard water is 
death to some plants. It should be tepid in tempera- 
ture. A plant may be chilled by a cold bath as well 
as a person. 

4. Small pots will, of course, require more frequent 
waterhig than large ones. Many have to be watered 
twice a day. Individual judgment alone can dictate in 
this matter, but a little common-sense and experience 

462 



SLOWER PLAKTS. 465 

Will soon point the way to success. If you find water 
staying in a pot, not evaporating within a day or two, 
do not give the plant so much at the next wetting. 
Stale water is as unwholesome for plants as it is for 
people. Too much water is as bad as none. 

5. See to the drainage of the pots. No vessel that 
has not a free outlet is a proper one in which to grow 
a plant. The bottom of the pot should be filled with 
a layer of broken bits of crockery, brick, glass, or any 
substance that will admit of free percolation. The 
soil in the pot should itself be light and porous. 

6. Evening is the best time for watering. Evapora- 
tion goes on more slowly at night time and the plant 
has a chance to absorb more water. This makes the 
flower appear at its brightest in the morning and con- 
tinues fresh throughout the day. 

7. A few drops of ammonia in a quart of water is 
occasionally good for plants, but a frequent recourse to 
stimulants is unadvisable. Manures of this sort are 
apt to favor the growth of foliage and stalk while they 
retard the development of flowers. 

8. Common glue is a good fertilizer in the proportion 
of one ounce to a gallon of water ; also soot from a 
stove or chimney where wood is burned. This latter 
should be mixed with hot water and allowed to cool be- 
fore use. After the buds have begun to swell on a 
plant, manure will increase the beauty and size of the 
flowers.

9. Let the plants have the morning sunshine if pos- 
sible. 

10. Give the plants a shower bath, if possible, once 
a week to cleanse the leaves of dust which often clogs 
up their respiratory organs, and so hinder their devel- 
opment. 



Cut Flowees. 



HOW TO KEEP THEM FRESH. 

Every lover of flowers must deplore their extreme 
frailty. It is really a sad thing to see how soon the 
splendid- hot-house bloom, the pretty garden flowers 
plucked with pride in our own beds, and the sweet-smell- 
ing nosegay sent to us by a friend, all wither with hope- 
less persistency. There is no known means to keep a 
flower from fading, but carelessness will often hasten 
its decay and spend its beauty before its time. 

1. If you wish to preserve cut flowers for anylength 
of time, do not rend them from the parent stalk with 
your fingers, as that bruises the cellular tissue and ren- 
ders the flower stem unable to absorb moisture when 
placed in a glass. Cut flowers with a pair of sharp 
shears or Avith a knife. 

2. Keep the flowers loosely arranged. They need 
air quite as much as moisture. They will wilt much 



CUT FLOWERS. 465 

more quiokly if tied in bunches than if they are loosely 
grouped in some commodious vessel. 

3. Keep them in a cool room where the air is pure. 
Smoke of any kind is apt to injure them, especially 
stale tobacco smoke. 



The following shows how easy it is to accumulate a 
fortune, provided proper steps are taken. The table 
shows what would be the result at the end of fifty 
years by saving a certain amount each day and putting 
it at interest at the rate of six per cent.

make a family quite independent; but the principle of 
small savings has been lost sight of in the general desire 
to become wealthy.

To polish a stove, rub with a newspaper instead of a 
brush. 

When cooking beans, add one-half tea-spoonful of 
saleratus. 

For burns apply flour wet with cold water, as it 
quickly gives relief. 

When sponge-cake becomes dry it is nice to cut in 
thill slices and toast. 

If the oven is too hot when baking, place a small dish 
of cold water in it. 

To prevent flat-irons from scorching, wipe them on a 
cloth wet with kerosene. 

To brighten or clean silver or nickle-plated ware, 
rub with a woolen cloth and flour. 

Copperas mixed with whitewash put upon the cellar

When there is a crack in the stove it can be mended 
by mixing ashes and salt with water. 

To make paper stick to a wall that has been white-

Starched shirts will iron easier if you let them dry 
after starching, so you will have to sprinkle them 
before ironing. 

Milk, if put in an earthen jar, or even a tin can, will 
keep sweet for a long time if well wrapped in a wet 
cloth. 

The wings of turkeys, geese and chickens are good 
to wash and clean windows, as they leave no dust nor 
lint as cloth. 

To brighten the inside of a coffee or tea-pot, fill with 
water and add a small piece of soap, and allow it to boil 
about forty-five minutes. 

To exterminate bedbugs, dissolve alum in water, and 
apply to the bedstead with a feather. Be careful not 
to touch the paint or varnish. 

Clean castor bottles with shot. 

To remove ink stains, soak in sour milk over 
night. 

Mix stove polish with vinegar and a teaspoonful of

To prevent mustard plasters from blistering, mix 
with the white of an egg. 

To clean furniture that is not varnished, rub Avith a

Mortar and paint may be removed from window-glasa 
with hot, sharp vinegar. 

Water in which borax is dissolved is good for the 
hair, and also to whiten the face and hands. 

To beat the whites of eggs quickly, add a pinch of 
salt. Salt cools, and cold eggs froth rapidly. 

White spots upon varnished furniture will disappear 
if you hold a hot plate from the stove over them. 

Never put salt into soup when cooking till it has 
been thoroughly skimmed, as salt prevents the scum 
from rising. 

A tablespoonful of stewed tomatoes or tomato catsup 
added to the gravy of either roast or fried meats, im-

Cayenne pepper blown into the cracks where ants

it until the grease is absorbed. 

You may avoid the unpleasantness to the eyes when 
peeling onions by sitting in a draught of air or by an

bleached by putting it for some days in a solution of 
bard soap to which strong ammonia has been added. 
The right proportions are one pound and a half of hard- 
cured soap, fifty pounds of soft water, and two-thirds 
of a pound of strong ammonia solution. The same 
object may be attained in a shorter time by placing the 
flannel for a quarter of an hour in a weak solution of 
bisulphate of sodium, to which a little hydrochloric 
acid has been added. 

Grass stains may be removed by washing with alco- 
hol. Fruit stains may be taken out by boiling water. 
Place the material over a basin or other vessel, and 
pour the boiling water from the kettle over the stains. 
Candle grease yields to a warm iron. Place a piece of 
blotting or other absorbing paper under the absorbing 
fabric ; put a piece of the paper also on the spot, apply 
the warm iron to the paper, and as soon as a spot of 
grease appears move the paper and press again until 
the spot disappears. Lard will remove wagon-grease. 
Rub the spot with the lard as if washing it, and when 
it is well out wash in the ordinary way with soap and 
water until thoroughly cleansed. 

Cold rain water and soap will remove macliine grease 
from washable fabrics. 

Fish may be scaled much easier by first dipping them 
into boiling water for a minute. 

Fresh meat beginning to sour, will sweeten if placed 

out of doors in the cool air over night.

Milk which has changed may be sweetened or ren- 
dered fit for use again by stirring in a little soda. 

Boiling starch is much improved by the addition of 
sperm or salt, or both, or a little gum-arabic dissolved. 

A tablespoonful of turpentine, boiled with your 
white clothes, will greatly aid the whitening process. 

Kerosene will soften boots and shoes that have been 
hardened by water, and will render them as pliable as 
new. 

If the wall about the stove has been smoked by the 
stove, cover the black patches with gum shellac, and 
they will not strike through either paint or kalso- 
mine. 

A good rule for baking potatoes is to wash and boil 
them in the usual way till nearly done, and then finish 
by baking. They are whiter and mealier than when 
baked the old way. 

Always remove the contents of tin-cans the moment 
they are opened. It is positively dangerous to leave 
canned goods in the open cans. The action of the air 
upon the soldering of the cans forms an oxide which 
renders the food unfit for use, cases of poisoning from 
this cause being reported from time to time 

To test oleomargerine take a small bit of lard and 
place it between two pieces of thin, common Avindow- 
glass, each piece about an inch square, and press to- 
gether until only a film remains. When held up to the 
light white, opaque spots are always to be seen. These

are crystals of fat. For the same reason oleomargerine 
and butterine, containing, as they do, solid fats, may be 
detected in the same manner. Pure butter, on the con- 
trary, does not show such specks. A little experiment 
with lard in this direction is an excellent means of cul- 
tivating the eye and qualifying one to readily determine, 
when applied to butters, the imitation from the genu- 
ine. This rule is practical enough, and is said to be a 
sure one. 

Wash the hair in cold sage tea. 

To brighten and clean old alpaca, wash in coffee. 

To brighten carpets, sprinkle with salt before sweep-

Cranberry jelly mixed with cold water, makes a re-

A LADY'S CHANCE OF MARRYING. 

Every woman has some chance to marry, it may be 
one to fifty, or it may be ten to one that she will. 
Representing her entire chance at one hundred at cer-

the following ratio ;

figures are often slender at that age. 

PROPORTIONATE WEIGHT AND HEIGHT OF WOMEN. 

Young girls are not as heavy in proportion to their 
height as grown women are. Many persons, however, 
have very erroneous ideas of what constitutes a be- 
coming figure. The following table will show what are 
the proper proportions of height and weight in a well- 
developed woman :
