(7)VERYB0DY knows Lizzie ! She is one of the best 
r cooks in town. I am sure of this, for "The 

**—*— n proof of the pudding is in the eating," and I have 
eaten. Her puddings are delicious, delicate, wholesome. 
In fact, I am a living monument to her skill. 

It seems a pity to waste such talents on a few individ- 
uals and it is my pleasant mission to acquaint a suffering, 
dyspeptic world with the virtues of Lizzie's well cooked 
dishes, spiced now and then with some of her pithy say- 
ings. 

Many cook books are too elaborate and confusing. 
They seem to be written for people, who live with great 
ceremony; who have retinues of servants at dinner, bring- 
ing in turtle soup and turkey, silver chafing-dishes and 
gold spoons. But, the majority of Americans do not live 
in this way at all; they are glad to have beefsteak and 
bread; wedgewood ware and one good servant. It is for 
this great majority, that " Lizzie's Cook Book " is written. 

No recipes will be found here for the dishes set before 
the Duke of Nocastle, when Mrs. Smith of Smithville 
entertained him and so incurred the undying enmity of 
her neighbors. But there are recipes, clear and exact, 
we hope, for getting good breakfasts, luncheons, dinners 
and suppers for people who live simply and rationally. 



6 PREFACE. 

The purpose is, to make this book, in one respect at 
least, like Wordsworth's "perfect woman," 

" Not too wise nor good, 

For human nature's daily food." 

With the recipes for cooking, are a few plain directions 
for marketing, for Lizzie markets as well as she cooks. 
When she starts off with the market basket on her aim, 
the good things of life seem to come out to meet her. 

Her searching, merry blue eye looks around the mar- 
ket or fruit store and spies all the tid-bits hidden away 
for the favorite customer or for the millionaire's table. 
Then she smiles her winsome smile at the market man 
and praises his baby; he can no more help bringing out 
those " goodies," than a fly can help going into a spider's 
net. 

" Everything good and nothing harmful." 

That "Lizzie's Cook Book" may be helpful "in the 
hour of need " is the sincere hope of 

"The Bachelette." 



[The authors desire to present their cordial acknowledgments 
to the skillful young stenographer and typewriter, Miss Nora 
Hall of Del Norte, whose kiud assistance has turned the labor of 
composition into a pleasure.]

HOW TO SELECT GOOD FLOUR. 



"It don't pay to buy poor flour to make good bread, 
because you can't make it." 

Good flour may be known by its soft, friendly feeling. 
Rub it through your fingers and it has no grit. Pinch 
it into a figure and it keeps its shape. Throw a little on 
the wall, and, if good, it will stick like the paper balls, 
which naughty children throw at the school-room ceiling. 
Sometimes it has a yellowish color, then again it isn't so 
yellow and is just as good. 

It is best for young housekeepers to buy flour in small 
quantities, until they have learned to select it well, or, 
have found a reliable brand. Some millers never send 
out anything but good flour, and their trade-mark is 
never questioned, which shows that "Honesty is the best 
policy," for the miller as well as for other people, though 
some millers never find that out. 



©t^EA©. 



It's half in the making and half in the baking. 

The making of bread is no small matter, for to make it 
good, takes time, strength and thought. Give a man 
good bread and butter and he will not ask for pies and 
cakes. 

The first thing is to buy good flour. Directions 
already given. 



White Bread. 

Flour, 3 q ts - 

Potatoes, 2 (boiled and mashed fine while hot.) 

Warm milk 2 qts. 

Or warm water, 2 qts. 

Sugar, 1 tablespoonful. 

Fine salt, 1 dessertspoonful. 

Compressed yeast, ) ■£ cake. 

Dissolve the yeast in a little luke warm water, then 
stir, or rather, beat all together in the bread pan. Set 
the pan where the sponge will keep moderately warm, 
but do not let it get hot. In three hours it should be 
light enough to knead. Add flour and knead into a 
dough stiff enough not to stick to the pan. Let it rise 
again, keeping it warm. Then mold into five loaves, 
put into pans well greased with good butter let it rise 



BREAD. II 

for third and last time, and then bake in a moderately 
hot oven lor about one hour. 

Some housekeepers prefer to set the sponge at night, 
knead the dough early in the morning and bake during 
the forenoon. There is a little risk of its souring or ris- 
ing too much, in this way. 

Others set the sponge in the morning — seven o'clock is 
a good hour — knead into dough about ten o'clock; mold 
into loaves and put in the oven about one o'clock. Both 
ways are good and you take your choice. 

Graham Bread. 

Fine white flour, r qt. 

Salt, i teaspoonful. 

Compressed yeast, % cake. 

Warm water, , i pf n t. 

Dissolve yeast in a little warm water, stir all well to- 
gether and set to rise in a warm place. When well 
risen, take a half cup of molasses, one tablespoonful of 
butter, and Graham flour enough to make a good stiff 
batter. Stir well with a spoon, then set to rise again. 
When light, put without kneading into pans, let them 
stand until the dough rises to the top of the pans, then 
bake in a hot oven about three-quarters of an hour.

cool. The next morning, cut into slices and fry on grid- 
dle greased with butter to a light brown.

flour. Stir all the time to avoid lumps. When well 
mixed, set where it will not burn and cook slowly a half 
an hour. 

Sago Mush.

BEEF. 

HOW TO TELL. GOOD BEEF. 

The best beef is of a clear red color, juicy in appear- 
ance, with a fine grain, smooth to the touch. In cold 
weather it should present a well mixed or marbled ap- 
pearance. The fat is of a clear, straw color. The suet 
should be of a brighter shade than the meat fat, dry but 
not hard; should crumble easily and show little fibre. 

The second quality of beef has flesh and fat of a darker 
color and is of a coarser grain, has less meat to the quan- 
tity of bone and is less juicy. 

The hind quarters are the choicest parts of the whole 
beef; from them is cut the famous "Baron of Beef," 
which is always served at the Christmas dinner of the 
queen or king of England. 

The "Baron of Beef" divided in the center makes two 
sirloins, which are cut into roasts and sirloin steaks. The 
tenderloin steak ox fillet de bomf is very delicate, but not 
so nutritious as the regular sirloin steaks. It is better 
for young housekeepers to find a good reliable butcher 
and depend upon him, until they have learned the differ- 
ent cuts and qualities of beef and signs of good meat. 

Roast Beef. 

Rib roast or any cut for roasting, should be put into a 
pan on a wire frame as this protects the meat so that it 



2 2 LIZZIES COOK BOOK. 

will not touch the water. Lay the beef on the wire in 
the pan, salt, pepper and flour it, put into a hot oven 
with a little water in the bottom of the pan. It will take 
about one hour to cook an eight pound roast. Baste 
well, while roasting. 

How To Buy Beefsteak. 

Never buy meat that is already cut. See the butcher 
cut it. Beefsteak should be at least two inches thick, 
with plenty of fat around the edge, and of a good clear 
red in color. Ask for sirloin, tenderloin or porter-house 
steak. These are the best and although dear, at first, 
cheaper in the end, because there is no waste. 

How To Broil a Beefsteak. 

Here is a rule adopted by the famous Beefsteak Club 
in London. 

"Pound well your meat until the fibres break; 
Be sure that next you have, to broil the steak, 
Good coals in plenty; nor a moment leave, 
But turn it over this way and then that. 
Then lean should be quite rare — not so the fat: 
The platter now and then the juice receive. 
Put on your butter — place it on your meat 
Salt, pepper; turn it over, serve and eat." 

The first direction in this piece of verse, most good 
cooks of the present day would tell you to neglect. Good 
steak should never be pounded. Poor steak may be im- 
proved by it, if anything can improve it. The following 
is a better way to cook steak: 

Trim off the fat around the edge of the steak, leaving 
some for cooking. Then slit the edges here and there 
with a sharp knife. Heat a clean broiler over a bed of 
clear red coals. Lay the steak on the broiler, and, when 



BEEF. 23 

one side is well browned, turn the meat and cook the 
other side brown. Put some butter on a hot plate, lay 
the steak on it, salt, pepper and serve immediately. 
Steak should not be put on the fire until the first course 
is already served. Those who prefer their steak cooked 
through, with no rare meat, should buy thinner steak. 

Beef a la Mode. 

Select seven pounds of the round of beef and remove 
the fat from the outside. With a clean skewer, make 
two holes down through the beef. Cut very thin pieces 
of salt pork. On them scatter cinnamon, cloves, fine 
mace and fill the holes in the beef with the pork thus 
seasoned. Tie the beef then with a cord around and 
around to form a loaf. Chop two large onions and 
brown in the skillet in butter, then put in flat bottomed 
iron pan and lay the loaf in on top of the onions, over 
which pour a teacup of boiling water. Then salt and 
pepper. Cook two honrs over a slow fire and cover 
closely, watching that it may not burn. When well 
done, take up in a deep dish and serve. 

Baked Beefsteak. 

L,ay the steak in a deep pan. Make a dressing of stale 
bread broken into small pieces, one small onion, chopped 
fine, salt, pepper and a piece of butter the size of a wal- 
nut. Soak the bread in hot water, then mix all together 
with a very very little nutmeg. The nutmeg gives a de- 
licious flavor, but there must not be enough to recog- 
nize. Mix the stuffing well and lay on one-half the 
steak, folding the other half over it. Press down the 
edges. Bake one-half hour in a very hot oven. Place 
in a hot dish and serve immediately.

Corned Beef. 

HOW TO SELECT CORNED BEEF. 

To test corn beef put a skewer through it, withdraw 
it, and if the meat is good the fragments that adhere to 
the skewer will be red and have an agreeable odor. 

Corned Beef. 

Take from three to five pounds of corn beef, pour boil- 
ing water on it, cover tight and boil three hours. Should 
it be very salt, the water must be changed at least once. 

Spanish Tomato Beefsteak. 

Take a very thick steak from the round of a beef, cut 
gashes in it with a sharp knife, fill the holes with pow- 
dered cracker crumbs and little bits of butter, then roll 
up tightly and tie. Pour a quart of tomatoes in a deep 
sauce-pan and lay the roll of beef into it. Cover closely 
and cook slowly for two and one-half hours, until the 
meat is well done. Then untie the roll, lay it on a hot 
platter, pouring the tomatoes, which will be a thick 
gravy, around the meat. 

Beef Heart. 

Clean out the heart and wash well, salt and fill with 
a bread dressing, as given in baked beefsteak, then put 
in pan, salt and pepper, and bake in oven for two hours. 
Very good if properly made. 

A Yorkshire Pudding. 

For every pint of milk take three eggs, three table- 
spoonfuls of flour, one pinch of salt. Stir to a batter and 
pour into the pan under roast beef, half an hour before it 



MUTTON. 25 

is to be taken from the oven. Serve on a plate with the 
roast. 

Irish Stew. 

Take about two pounds of beef and mutton, mix and 
chop into small pieces one inch square. Put into a 
skillet and cover with cold water. Set over the fire, add 
two good sized onions, one nice tomato and one small 
carrot, cut into small square pieces. Boil one and one- 
half hours. When meat and vegetables are tender, add 
salt, pepper and four good sized Irish potatoes. Add a 
piece of butter the size of a walnut, a good tablespoonful of 
flour mixed well with a little cold water and stir gently 
into the stew just before taking it off the fire. 

This is very good. 

MUTTON. 

HOW TO CHOOSE GOOD MUTTON. 

The fat should be clear and hard, the lean firm, juicy 
and of a rich, darkish red color. The leg bones clean 
and lean or quite white. 

Poor mutton is seldom fat, or, if plump, the fat has a 
yellowish appearance, the flesh is flabby, the kidney 
small and stringy, and the lean, seen through the skin on 
the back, is of a dark, bluish shade. 

If possible select the hind quarter of mutton or 
lamb, as that is always the best. 

Roast I,ecx of Mutton or Umb. 

Take a good leg of mutton or lamb, wash nicely, put 
into a pan, salt, pepper and flour it. Then pour a little hot 
water in the pan and bake in a hot oven for one and one- 
half hours, basting well all the time to keep the meat 
from being dry. Should the oven be too hot, place an- 
other pan over the meat. 



26 lizzie's cook book. 

Mutton Chops. 

Buy lean chops, cut out all extra fat and scrape the 
small end of the bones. Have the broiler hot. Broil 
brown but do not burn. Then salt, pepper and serve on 
a hot platter. Do not cook until nearly ready to be 
served. 

Roast Mutton or Lamb. 

Always, if possible, get the hind quarter of lamb or 
mutton as that is the best. The fore quarter, however, 
is very nice. Take out bones, fill with stale crumbs well 
seasoned as in baked beefsteak. Sew up and bake in a 
quick oven. It will be fine. 

Minced Mutton or Lamb. 

Remove fat and bones from cold mutton or lamb and 
chop fine. To one cup of meat, add salt, pepper and 
one-half cup of thickened gravy. Put all into the pan, 
heat a little and serve very hot. 

Scalloped Mutton. 

Cut cold mutton into thin pieces. Remove all bone, 
fat and gristle. Place a layer of bread crumbs on the 
bottom of a shallow dish, then a layer of mutton, then a 
layer of boiled maccaroni. Then add gravy left from day 
before. Moisten one cup of crumbs with one tablespoon- 
ful of butter. Scatter this on the top and bake about 
twenty minutes until brown. 

VEAL. 

HOW TO CHOOSE GOOD VEAL. 

The fat should be white and clear, the lean pink or 
flesh color. White veal or that from calves less than six 
weeks old is not suitable for food. 



VEAL. 27 

Roast Veal. 

The principal thing in cooking veal is to have it well 
done. Take about three pounds of veal from the leg, 
salt, pepper, put in a pan with some butter. Dredge a 
little flour on it and bake in a hot oven. It requires 
about two hours to cook it well. 

Veal Cutlets. 

Try to get the loin cutlets, as they are always the best. 
Take about six good cutlets, one egg and some cracker 
crumbs. Put some butter on the bottom of a pan, heat 
it very hot and cook the cutlets slowly. Take them up 
when well done and lay on a hot platter, but do not 
cover them. Keep hot until served. 

Veal Stew. 

Take about two pounds of veal from the ribs and cu* 
into small pieces. Put pieces into a pan, cover with 
cold water and let them simmer slowly for about one 
hour. Then salt and pepper. Wet one tablespoon nil of 
flour with cold water and stir in slowly. Then, if you 
wish to have dumplings, take one cup of flour, one-half 
teaspoonful of salt, one egg, one-half cup of sweet milk, 
one teaspoonful of baking powder. Mix well and drop 
into the meat, cover tightly and cook for about fifteen 
minutes. It will then be ready to serve. 

Veal Loaf. 

Take three pounds of lean veal, boil in a little water 
and chop fine with a quarter of a pound of salt pork, two 
eggs well beaten and one cup of rolled crackers. ' Salt 
and pepper to taste. Mix all well together and press

down into a deep pan. Set this into a meat pan full of 
hot water, put in the oven and bake slowly for one hour. 
When cold cut into thin slices. Very nice for luncheon. 

Veal Fricassee. 

Buy the ends of the ribs and some of the breast, about 
two pounds in all. Cut into small pieces, dredge with 
flour and brown in butter or salt pork fat. Then put 
into a pot, cover with boiling water, skim as it begins to 
boil and cook until well done. 

Meat Souffle. 

Cold meat of any kind is good for this dish. Remove 
all bones and fat and chop fine. Place a layer of bread 
crumbs in the bottom of a dish and then a layer of meat. 
Pepper and butter. Add a little onion or thyme. Then 
another layer of crumbs and of meat, seasoned as before. 
Beat one egg well, add to it one pint of milk °nd pour 
over the meat. Add more milk if necessary, to bring 
milk up to the top of the crumbs. Then bake in a hot 
oven for about one-half hour, until the top is well done. 

Stuffed Veal. 

"Buy about five pounds of the shoulder of veal. Have 
'the blade bone taken out and prepare a stuffing of stale 
bread. Break one loaf of bread into small pieces, put in 
a little butter and salt and pepper to taste. Add a little 
sage, then fill the veal, sew up and spread butter 
over it. Bake about two hours in hot oven. 

vSweet Breads. 

Lay the sweet breads in cold water with a little salt 
before ushi?. Take out of the water and dry thoroughly

by pressing gently between folds of clean, soft linen. 
Have ready a hot pan with butter. After dipping the 
sweet breads in flour put into the pan and fry brown, 
serving hot. 

Calf's ok Sheep's Brains. 

Soak the brains over night in cold water with a little 
salt. In the morning pour off the salt water and 
plunge them into boiling water. Then skim them very 
carefully, so as not to break the fibres. Flour them and 
have ready a pan good and hot with some butter. Fry 
brown, but do not burn. Some people like them rolled 
in cracker crumbs instead of flour. Serve hot 

Scrambled Brains. 

Clean the brains as above, put into a pan, pour a little 
water over them, add a good piece of butter, salt and 
pepper to taste, and let them simmer slowly. Then 
have ready some small picres of toast, raise the brains 
carefully and lay on the toast. Serve immediately. 

PORK. 

Some folks of long ago said that the devil went into 
the swine and never came out. Perhaps he did, but I 
like ham. So many other people like ham and pork too, 
and persist in eating them, that it is better to give 
recipes for cooking them well. Buy, if possible, pork 
from the pig that has been home raised. Many people 
are poisoned by not buying their pork with care. There 
is hardly any part of the pig but can be eaten, and con- 
sequently many people almost live upon it. 

Pork Chops. 

Buy loin chops, have pan very hot and keep frying un- 
til nicely browned. Serve immediately.

Boiled Ham. 

Put a good sized ham into boiling water and keep it 
boiling for about four hours, until very tender. Then 
let it stand until the water cools. Take out, skin it and 
pepper well. Stick some cloves into it, lay it where it 
will keep cool and cut thin. It makes a good lunch 
dish. 

Deviled Ham. 

Cut some cold boiled ham very fine, add a little good 
mustard and pepper. Take three hard boiled eggs, chop 
fine, put all into the bowl and mix well. Then put into 
a mold or deep dish, press hard and cut thin. 

Spare Ribs. 

Wipe the spare ribs off well and salt and pepper to 
taste. Have your oven hot and bake the ribs one-half 
hour. Have the bones cracked before cooking. Bad for 
dyspeptics. 

Roast Pork. 

Take about six or eight pounds of the ribs of fresh pork 
and slash the skin, if it is not removed. Salt and pepper 
well, sprinkle the whole with some flour and a little sage. 
Have the oven very hot and bake about two hours, tak- 
ing care not to burn it. Pork requires more cooking than 
any other kind of meat as it is very unwholesome if not 
well cooked. Baste well, while roasting. Serve hot. 
Some always serve apple sauce with roast pork. 

Liver. 

Liver of any kind is better soaked in water a little 
while before using. Then slice it, have ready a pan with 



SOUP STOCK. 31 

good hot butter and brown the slices, taking care to let 
them cook through well as liver is not very digestible. 
Serve hot. 

Kidney Stew. 

Take as many kidneys as will be required and put on 
to boil for a few minutes with a little salt. Then take 
up and cut intc small square pieces. Put a good lump 
of butter into a pan. Let it brown, then put the kidneys 
in with a little water over them and boil well until ten- 
der. Add about one-half glass of good wine and one 
tablespoonful of flour wet with water to thicken thestew. 
Salt and pepper to taste, place little pieces of toast on a 
platter and pour the stew over them, serving hot. 

Ham and Eggs. 

Cut the ham into thin slices and have the pan good 
and hot. Lay the slices into the pan and brown well. 
Care should be taken not to burn. Fry the eggs in the 
fat and serve on the slices of ham. 

SOUP STOCK. 

Take from four to eight pounds of lean beef, with the 
shin bone and some mutton and veal. Put over the fire 
in a large pot, or stock-kettle, cover with cold water and 
simmer slowly for at least four hours. Take two large 
onions, one turnip, one carrot and a little celery. Cut 
up and put all into the stock. Boil well for two hours. 
Care should be taken to skim well before putting in the 
vegetables. When well boiled, strain and set away to 
cool. When cold, remove all the fat and put the stock 
where it will keep cool, It will keep for several days. 
Any kind of soup can be made from this stock. When 



32 lizzie's cook book. 

a large quantity of this stock is made, it is well to put it 
into several small jars. Only one of these will be re- 
quired at a time and the film of grease which makes an 
air tight covering, can be left on the top of the others un- 
til ready to use them. The stock will keep better in this 

way. 

Bouillon. 

Buy from four to eight pounds of beef from shoulder. 
Put over the fire early in the morning in cold water and 
simmer slowly for about four hours. Skim well, then 
add salt and pepper to taste. Add two onions, one car-

Cut up one ox tail with about two pounds of lean beef, 
a knuckle of veal and some mutton bones. Put all into 
a soup pot. Cover with cold water and simmer slowly. 
Stir occasionally, and remove all scum. After simmer- 
ing for about four hours, put in salt, pepper and one 
onion. Cook two hours longer, then strain and set in a 
cool place. When cold skim, and it will be ready to 
serve. The longer soup is cooked, the better it is. 

Rice-Tomato Soup. 

Take some of the soup stock and put into it one cup of 
tomatoes. Heat well, let it stand a little, then add one- 
half cup of rice. Cook one-half hour before serving. 
Season well with salt and pepper. Serve very hot.

Pick over one pint of beans, wash and soak in cold 
water over night. In the morning, put them on to boil, 
covering with water. Boil slowly, being careful not to 
let them burn. Add water, if necessary. When the 
beans are well done, rub them through a colander. Then 
add about one quart of sweet milk, butter the size of a 
walnut, salt and pepper to taste. Put in rice boiler just

serving put in a pinch of soda. Always serve soup hot. 

Mutton Broth. 

Buy about two pounds of lean mutton from the shoul- 
der, cut into small pieces, put into cold water and cook 
very slowly. Skim well, as the grease of mutton is not 
good. Cook about thiee hours, then strain and add one- 
half cup of rice. Salt and pepper to taste. Boil until 
rice is done and serve hot. Some people like a little on- 
ion, but when made for invalids, the onion should be 
omitted. 

Clam Chowder. 

Pare and cut into small pieces four or six good sized 
potatoes. Boil, mash and add twenty-four large clams 
with their juice. Have ready about two quarts of warm 
sweet milk. Add the milk and a good tablespoonful of

the oyster juice with a tablespoonful of good butter. Put 
the oysters in the soup-tureen without cooking add 
one-half cup of cracker crumbs rolled very fine. Now

immediately. In this way the oysters will be deliciously 
tender, 

Lentil Soup. 

Soak a pint of lentils over night in cold water. 
About nine o'clock in the morning, put them on to cook, 
add more water and a little beef. Boil until very soft, 
then rub through a colander and add about one quart of

of the meat, cut into small pieces, one glass of sherry 
wine and the juice of two lemons. Toast and butter two

pieces and drop into the soup. Very good, if properly 
made. 

Chicken Broth. 

Cut one good sized, old chicken into pieces, put in 
the soup pot, cover with water and boil slowly for about 
three hours. Some chickens are much older than the 
poultry dealers say, and require more cooking. When 
tender, remove the bones, strain the soup, add about one- 
half cup of rice, then boil very slowly for another half 
hour so as to keep the rice whole. Add pepper and salt 
and serve. 

For invalids this soup is good, but it is better not to 
add the rice, as man}' people are not fond of it, or it may 
not agree with them. 

Turkey Soup. 

A very delicious soup may be made out of the bones 
of the turkey after the meat is removed. Put them into 
a pot and cover with cold water; boil slowly, and when 
the broth begins to look like soup, open a can of sweet 
corn and pour it into the pot. Boil about one-half hour 
longer. Then let it stand. Add salt and pepper to 
taste. Boil up again and serve at once. 

Salsify or Oyster Plant Soup. 

Take two bunches of salsify, scrape, and cut into 
small pieces. Put on to boil and, when tender, rub 
through a colander. About twenty minutes before serv- 
ing, add one quart of sweet milk, a little piece of butter 
the size of a walnut and salt and pepper to taste. Heat 
to boiling point and serve immediately. 



FOWL. 



Turkey. 

HOW TO CHOOSE A GOOD TURKKV. 

Select a large hen turkey, weighing about eight or 
ten pounds. If its feet and legs are clean, not covered 
with scales, and the end of the breast bone soft, it is good. 
Kill two days before using. 

Roast Turkey. 

Remove the entrails, pick off* all the small feathers and 
singe carefully, then wash and dry off with a clean towel. 
Salt the inside well and lay it ina large pan until ready to 
fill. To make the stuffing, break up fine one loaf of 
stale bread and soak in water or milk. When soaked, 
beat well with a spoon. Add a lump of butter the size 
of an egg. Salt and pepper to taste. Sprinkle a little 
sage, or any other spice which may be desired. Some 
people like a little flavor of onion. When the onion is 
used, chop it fine and brown in a spider with hot butter, 
before putting it into the stuffing. Stuff the turkey, and 
sew up the breast. Lay it in a large baking pan, put but- 
ter, flour, salt and pepper over it. Have oven very hot at 
first, that the pores may be closed at once. Brown well 
and baste very often. It will take about two hours to 
cook thoroughly. A larger one will require a longer 
time. 



SS lizzie's cook book. 

To Make the Gravy. 

Boil the heart, gizzard, liver and neck in two quarts 
•of water two hours; take them out, chop very fine, and 
put them back again; thicken with one spoonful of 
flour wet with cold water, and season with pepper and 
salt. Let this simmer one hour longer, and when you 
dish the turkey turn the drippings into the gravy. Boil 
up once and send to the table. 

Boned Turkey. 

Buy an old turkey weighing about eight pounds. 
Clean well, cut into pieces, put on to boil until the meat 
will drop from the bones. Then take out of the pot and 
pick out all the bones. Chop meat very fine. (Some 
people like it better in pieces.) Season well with salt 
and pepper. Take a pint or more of the liquor in which 
it has boiled, and add to the meat. Then put into deep 
dish and press down. Let it stand until cold, cut thin, 
and serve. Very nice luncheon or tea dish, if well 
cooked. 

How To Select Good Chicken. 

The signs of a good chicken are about the same as 
those of a young turkey. The legs and feet should be 
clean and the end of the breast- bone soft. The spurs 
should be loose and short. When old, the legs are 
rough, the spurs hard and firmly fixed, and the end of 
breast-bone hard. There are few creatures more tender 
than a young chicken and few more tough than an old 
fowl. Great care should be taken in selecting. Young 
chickens are best for cooking in many ways, but spring 
chickens are generally poor, unless well fed. By some, 
the yellow chickens are preferred, by others, the white. 



CHICKEN. 39 

Split Back Chickens. 

Split two young chickens down the back and clean 
well, then lay them into a baking pan and put salt, pep- 
per, flour, and pieces of butter over them. Have a good 
hot oven ready and put a little boiling water into the 
pan, around the chickens, but not over them. Then 
baste, and when brown, turn them over in the pan and 
baste again well. They will cook in about one-half 
hour. When done, take them up on a hot platter. Pour 
gravy over them and serve hot at once. 

Fried Chicken. 

Buy two young chickens. Clean, wash and wipe well. 
Cut them into pieces; flour and lay aside until ready to 
fry. Heat some butter in a pan and when very hot, lay 
pieces of chicken in. Salt and pepper well. Brown one 
side, then turn over and brown the other. When thor- 
oughly cooked, cover up and take from the fire. When 
ready to serve, place chickens on hot platter, put one 
tablespoonful of flour in pan from which the chickens have 
been removed. Mix well with the fat in the pan, then 
add one cup of good cream or milk, stirring well all the 
time. Pour this gravy over the chicken and serve hot. 

Chicken Fricassee. 

Clean a nice sized chicken well and cut into small 
pieces. Put into the pot, cover with cold water and cook 
slowly for about two hours. If the chicken is old, it will 
take longer. When tender, salt and pepper. Wet two 
tablespoonfuls of flour with a little cold water and stir 
gradually into the chicken. Remove from the fire for 
fear of burning. Serve on crackers laid into a platter, 
taking pieces up carefully not to break them. Serve hot.

Chicken Pie. 

Cut a young chicken into small pieces and parboil a 
little. Then take it up, lay it in a deep dish, salt, pepper 
and pour the "liquor in wnich it was parboiled, over the 
pieces. Sift two cups of flour, in which, rub one-half cup 
of butter. Add a good pinch of salt, two teaspoonfuls 
of baking powder and one cup of sweet milk. Mix this 
dough well, roll out and lay over the chicken. Put in a

with a little hot water and flour. Bake about one hour, 
then lay toast on the platter, put the quail on top of the 
toast and serve very hot. 

Fried Quail. 

Fried quail are very nice. Cut very young ones down 
the back and flour well. Have ready some butter in a 
pan very hot, and when the pieces are nicely browned, 
cover very close and let them stand for a few minutes. 
Some people prefer them broiled, but great care has to be 
taken in broiling not to let them burn. 

Broiled Quail. 

Have ready a good bed of coals and have broiler very 
hot. Butter the platter. Salt and pepper the quail. 
Broil the quail quickly and lay on hot platter. Serve im- 
mediately. 

SIGNS BY WHICH YOU MAY KNOW YOUNG DUCKS. 

When young and tender the joints in the legs will 
break by the weight of the duck. The windpipe will 



42 lizzie'e cook book. 

break by a very little presure. Young geese are known 
by the same signs and also by the fact that the wings 
will meet over the back. 

Roast Duck. 

Buy young ducks and prepare by getting all the pin- 
feathers off nicely and singeing well. Clean and soak in 
salt water over night, then dry well on a clean napkin. 
Flour, salt, pepper and lay in a baking pan. Have 
ready a good hot oven. Put a little hot water in the 
pan about the duck. Bake two hours. Some like them 
stuffed like a turkey. 

A good stuffing may be prepared in this way: Take 
one loaf of stale bread and soak in water or milk. Have 
ready two onions chopped fine and brown them in but- 
ter. Mix onion with bread, salt and pepper. Salt the 
bird well and fill with the stuffing. 

Tame Pigeon. 

These beautiful birds are used for food, though they 
are sometimes very dry eating and good only for pot pie, 
fricassee and stew. Among the many varieties are those 
with ruffled, raised feathers around the neck. The most 
beautiful ones are the best to eat. Squabs are young 
pigeons. They are very tender, delicate, and good food 
for invalids, when broiled or stewed. 

English Snipes. 
Broil or stew them. 



FISH- 

Salmon. 

HOW TO CHOOSE SALMON. 

This nuble fish is considered very choice and nutritious. 
It is somewhat high priced. Salmon have small heads 
and are quite thick in the shoulders. They weigh from 
six to twelve pounds. When cut, the flesh ought to be 
solid, flaky and pink. 

Boiled Salmon. 

Take about three pounds of salmon, wrap it in a clean 
cloth, put into a pan and cover with water. Salt it and

cream. 

Fried Salmon. 

Cut the salmon into thin slices, have a pan hot with 
some butter, and fry very slowly. Be careful not to let

some of the dark. Put into a bowl and chop fine. Salt 
and peppor well. Then take several good heads of let-

dressing, not making it too thin. If prepared two hours 
or more before using, it is better put in a cold place. 
Serve in salad dish, garnished with lettuce leaves and 
hard boiled eggs. Some people prefer celery, and when 
used, it should be very tender.

Vegetables should be very carefully cooked. Many 
people think that beans and beets are very indigestible.. 
But this is not so, when well cooked. Young house- 
keepers are very apt to serve the vegetables before they 
are thoroughly done. Beware of this and give them 
plenty of time. 

Boiled Potatoes. 

Pare and wash well as many potatoes as may be neces- 
sary for dinner. About one-half hour before it is time to 
serve, lay them into a pan of boiling water and boil 
briskly. Some potatoes take longer to cook then others, 
but most of them will cook in one-half hour. When 
well done, salt, pour out the water and set on the back 
of the stove to dry. This will make them white and 
mealy. 

Scalloped Potatoes. 

Pare and slice ten potatoes. Take a deep dish and put 
into it a layer of potatoes, sprinkling over them, flour,, 
salt, pepper and a little butter. Then put another layer 
of potatoes with seasoning as before. Keep on until the 
dish is full. Just before putting into the oven, add a 
pint of sweet milk. Bake about three-quarters of an hour 
in a slow oven. Good, if well done.

L/Yonnaise Potatoes. 

Cut twelve cold boiled potatoes into square pieces. 
Fry two teaspoonfuls of chopped onions in two table- 
spoonfuls of butter, then add potatoes, stirring with a 
fork, being careful not to break them. Salt and pepper 
to taste. Cook ten minutes longer. When done add 
parsley and serve hot.

Cream Potatoes. 

Cut four good sized potatoes into square pieces. Boil 
until tender, but not until they break. Then drain in 
hot colander and add one cup of good cream. If cream 
is not at hand, add one cup of milk and a little butter. 
Pepper and salt to taste. Chop up a little parsley and 
scatter over after putting in the dish. Serve hot. 

Breakfast Potatoes. 

Cut six good sized potatoes into small square pieces. 
Heat some butter in a pan until very hot. Put potatoes 
into the pan, then add a little more butter, salt and pep- 
per. Cover well while cooking, being careful not to let 
them burn. Stir occasionally. When done, place in dish 
and serve hot. 

Boiled Sweet Potatoes. 

Sweet potatoes require more time for cooking than Irish 
potatoes. Take large, fine potatoes, wash, clean and boil 
with the skins on in plenty of water, but without salt. 
They will require at least one hour for cooking. Pour 
off the water, set them back on the stove in the pot in 
which they were cooked to dry for a few minutes. 
Peel them before sending to the table.

Baked Sweet Potatoes. 

Select those which are of nearly the same size, but not 
too large. Bake like common potatoes, except that they 
require a longer time. 

Baked Sweet Potatoes, No. 2. 

Steam the potatoes until they are almost done. Then 
put them into the oven and bake until they are soft at 
the heart. 

Rice as a Vegetable. 

Rice should first be picked over carefully, washed and 
dried. Then put into boiling water, salted and boiled 
twenty minutes. There should be plenty of water. At 
the end of twenty minutes, pour oft" the water, cover the 
rice and set it on the back of the stove to steam for about 
fifteen minutes. If it steams well during this time it 
will be done, and every grain will be distinct and whole. 
If any water is left, pour it off and for eveiy cup of rice 
add one-half cup of milk. Warm the milk before adding 
it. 

Squash. 

Peel the squash, cut into pieces, put in steamer and 
cook one hour. When done, drain well and mash fine. 
Add salt, pepper and butter. Serve hot. 

Stuffed Squash. 

Pare a small squash and slice off the top. Take out 
the seeds and lay the squash in salt and water for a few 
minutes. Then take out, dry and fill with a good stuff- 
ing of crumbs, chopped salt pork, parsley etc., wet with 
gravy. Put on the top slice and set the squash in a 
pudding dish, with a few teaspoonfuls of melted butter 



52 lizzie's cook book. 

and as much hot water. Cover and bake two hours. 
Then take out, lay in a fresh dish and pour the gravy 
over it. 

Turnips. 

Pare the turnips and cut into small pieces. Put 
them in water well salted and boil until tender. Then 
drain thoroughly. Mash fine, add a piece of butter, pep- 
per and salt to taste and a small teaspoonful of sugar. 
Mix thoroughly and serve hot. 

Turnips, No. 2. 

Pare and cut into square pieces. Put into boiling' 
water and cook until done. Pour off the water, season 
with butter, salt and pepper. 

Beets. 

Some people think this vegetable not fit for the 
table but it is very good, when properly cooked. Beets 
should cook at least four hours, keeping plenty of water 
on them. When tender, pour cold water over them and 
the skin will come off. Then put into a bowl and chop 
fine. Add salt, pepper, vinegar and a little butter. 
Place over fire again and serve hot. 

Beets, No. 2. 

Beets are always good for fresh pickle. Boil them 
well, skin, cut into thin slices, pour vinegar over them 
and serve cold. 

Baked Tomatoes. 

Take as many tomatoes as necessary for dinner and 
bake them whole. Then scoop out a little place at 



VEGETABLES. 53 

the top of each one. Fill with cracker crumbs, a little 
salt, pepper and butter. Put them back into the oven to 
brown. Care must be taken not to burn them. Serve 
hot. Very nice. 

Scalloped Tomatoes. 

Boil some macaroni well. Place a layer of macaroni 
in an earthen dish, then a layer of tomatoes. Season 
well with pepper, salt and a little butter. Then another 
layer of macaroni and tomatoes seasoned as before and 
so on, making the last layer of tomatoes. Bake about 
twenty minutes in a moderately hot oven. Some like 
cracker or bread crumbs over the top. Serve hot. 

Steamed Tomatoes. 

Peel the tomatoes, cut into pieces and put into a pan. 
Granite ware is always the best, as tin or iron spoils the 
taste. Steam slowly for about one-half hour, then add a 
lump of butter the size of a walnut, a half teaspoonful of 
salt, pepper to taste and one teaspoonful of sugar. Have 
ready some pieces of toast and break into the tomatoes 
just before serving. For steaming, use the double gran- 
ite ware kettles, if possible. 

String Beans. 

This vegetable should be cooked a long time. Two 
hours is not too long, but care should be taken not to let 
them burn. Break up into small pieces and put on to 
boil. If very old, they will require a pinch of baking 
soda in the water. Skim, and they will cook without 
changing the water. Take out when well done, strain 
off all the water, add salt and pepper to taste and a good 
sized piece of butter. Serve hot. 



54 lizzie's cook book. 

Lima Beans. 

These beans are very good in summer. Shell and put 
on to boil. Take care to keep plenty of water on them. 
Cook about one hour. Salt and pepper. Add cream, or 
if there is no cream, a little butter. 

Green Peas. 

Green peas are very nice when fresh. Boil not more 
than one-half hour. When done, strain off the water, 
salt and pepper to taste and add a little butter or cream. 
Do not let them stand long after cooking. Serve very 
hot. 

Corn Oysters. 

Cut the kernels of six or eight good ears of corn from 
the cobs and put into an earthen bowl. Break two eggs 
on the corn. Add a little salt and pepper to taste and 
two tablespoonfuls of flour wet with water. Mix well. 
Have ready in a pan some butter very hot. Drop spoon- 
fuls of the corn into the pan and fry brown. Very good. 

Green Corn. 

Take as many ears of corn as are needed for dinner. 
Pull oft* the husks and boil the ears about twenty min- 
utes before they are to be served. Pour on boiling water 
and cover tightly. When done, take out of water and 
serve on platter, wrapped in clean napkin. 

Asparagus 

This vegetable is very nice when young and tender. 
Cut the hard part off the stalks and tie them up in nice 
little bunches. Boil about one-half hour. Season and 
have ready some slices of toast well buttered. Lay the 
asparagus on the toast and serve hot. Some like cream 



VEGETABLES. 55 

on asparagus, but if used, it should be poured on just be- 
fore the asparagus is taken to the table. 

Spinach. 

Take the leaves of spinach, no stems, and wash 
them thoroughly. Put them in enough salt and water 
to cover them and boil until tender. Then take them 
out and put into cold water to set the fresh green color. 
Let them remain in the water until cold, then rub 
through a colander with a potato masher. Heat, season 
and serve. 

Spinach, No. 2. 

Wash the leaves well, taking care to pick out all poor 
ones. Put on over the stove in boiling water and cook 
about one-half hour. Then strain well. Chop up fine, 
add salt, pepper and a good piece of butter. Mold in 
little cups, as many as will be wanted for dinner. Set 
the cups in a pan of hot water and when ready to serve, 
turn out of the cups on a warm platter. Have ready 
some hard boiled eggs, cut them into slices and lay over 
each cup of spinach. It makes a very nice appetizing 
dish. Serve hot. 

Egg Plant. 

Peel the plant and cut into slices, salt well, cover 
over and let them lie for two hours or more. Drain off all 
the water and wipe the slices. Dip in butter and 
cracker crumbs. Have ready some butler in a hot pan, 
and fry rapidly, but take care not to burn. Serve very 
hot. 

Egg Plant. 

SPANISH. 

Put two large egg plants in a kettle of boiling water. 



56 lizzie's cook book. 

Boil one hour. Remove the pulp and mix with it half 
an onion chopped fine, one-half a green pepper, and salt 
to taste. Put all into an earthen dish, and pour over it 
half a cup of cream. Place in the oven and let it bake 
slowly one-half hour. 

Cauliflower. 

Remove all the green leaves except a few of the lit- 
tle ones. Put on in boiling water and cook until tender, 
which will take about twenty minutes. Care should be 
taken not to break in cooking. Take up carefully, drain, 
salt, butter and serve hot. Instead of butter, cream may 
be used. 

Stewed Celery. 

Clean the heads of celery thoroughly. Take off coarse, 
green outer leaves, cut into small pieces and stew in a 
little broth. When tender, add some rich cream, a little 
flour and a little butter. Season with pepper and salt. 

Mushrooms. 

Take off the outside of the mushrooms and put them 
into a pan with a little boiling water. Boil about one- 
half hour, then add salt, pepper and butter. Serve hot 
in a deep platter. Mushrooms are of a bright pink in- 
side, while toadstools are white or yellow. Another 
method of distinguishing between mushrooms and toad- 
stools is by putting in a silver spoon when cooking. If 
poison the spoon will be blackened. 

Fried Mushrooms. 

Wash and pare them, cut off the stems, have ready a 
very hot pan with butter, and fry until thoroughly done.

Broiled Oysters. 

Take as many oysters as are required and have ready 
a good bed of hot coals. Drain the oysters well, lay 
them on the gridiron and hold over the coals. Great 
care should be taken not to burn them. Have ready small 
slices of toast well buttered; lay the oysters on the toast 
and serve hot. A very nice dish, but very difficult to 
cook without scorching. 

Stuffed Potatoes. 

Select potatoes all of one size, cut off each end and 
bake. Take from the oven and scoop out the inside with 
a spoon, being careful not to break the skins. Add to 
the part scooped out, butter, pepper and salt, beating to- 
gether until very light. Then fill the skins, lay on a

HOW TO TEW* FRESH EGGS. 

If eggs are put into a bowl of cold water the fresh 
ones will float to the top. One of the best ways to be 
sure of fresh eggs, however, is to buy them of a dealer 
who has them brought in fresh every day. 

Jellied Eggs. 

Pour a quart of boiling water in a dish, lay as many 
eggs into it as the water will cover, ten minutes before 
serving, cover tight. Very good, especially for invalids. 

Baked Eggs. 

Lay the eggs in a pan and bake for one-half hour in a 
moderately hot oven. This cooks both whites and yolks 
until mealy like a baked potato. Invalids can often eat 
eggs baked in this way, when they cannot eat them 
boiled soft or poached. 

Baked Eggs, No. 2. 

Put a lump of butter in a baking pan and let it melt, 
then break eggs into it and set in a moderately hot oven, 
Watch carefully that they do not burn. Bake from 
eight to ten minutes. 

Scrambled Eggs. 

Take a dozen half sheets of stiff note paper and turn 
up the edges of each piece, making little dishes. Break 



74 LIZZIE S COOK BOOK. 

the eggs in a saucer. Place the dishes on the top of a 
moderately hot stove, put a little butter in each one and 
grease the whole surface carefully. Drop an egg into 
each dish and stir gently with a silver fork. Season 
with a little pepper and salt. Serve hot. Very delicate 
and nice, but difficult to cook well. 

Scrambled Eggs, No. 2. 

Heat a pan on top of the stove with a little butter in 
it. Break eggs in a dish and then put into the pan. 
Season well and stir until done. When cooked enough, 
the eggs will be light. Take up on a hot platter. 

Poached Eggs. 

Pour boiling water into pan and add a pinch of salt. 
Break eggs in a saucer one by one and drop into the 
water. Boil slowly, taking care to have the water cover 
the yolks. Have ready some pieces of bread well 
browned. Take each egg up carefully without breaking 
and lay on the toast. 

Fried Eggs. 

Have a hot pan with some butter in it. Break eggs in 
a saucer, drop into the pan and fry rapidly. Take out as 
soon as cooked, unless they are to be turned over. If 
they are to be turned, turn quickly. Then serve on a 
hot platter, on toast or on crackers dipped in boiling 
water. 

Omelet. 

Beat yolks and whites of six eggs separately. Into 
the yolks stir a pint of good milk and a little salt; then 
add the whites of the eggs, beating all together. Have 
ready a pan with very hot butter, pour in the eggs and 



OMELETS. yc 

set in a very hot oven. Bake for about eight minutes, 
watching to keep from burning. Take the omelet 
up carefully and lay on a hot platter, folding over on it- 
self. Serve immediately. 

Ham Omelet. 

Make in the same manner as above and add one-half 
cup of boiled ham, chopped very fine. Take up on hot 
platter and fold as above. 

Oyster Omelet. 

Make as in the first omelet, adding twelve fresh oys- 
ters chopped. 

Omelet with Jelly. 
Make omelet as in first recipe, then take it from the 
oven and spread it with one layer of currant or any acid 
jelly. Fold over as in the first.

My Grandmother's Sayings. 

My grandmother used to say, ' ' There is a great deal 
of nonsense talked about cake-making. It is not half 
the worry that people think. If you are in haste or have 
unexpected company, just do this." 

Then she would carefully lay aside the "big Bible," 
take off her spectacles, put on a large checked apron and 
go out into a kitchen as large as the whole of a modern 
flat. She would break the eggs into the bowl, measure 
into it flour, sugar, etc., stir all around quickly a few 
times, pour into a pan and set into the oven. This would 
take about five minutes and the cake was always good. 

This will do with simple recipes, but very elaborate 
ones must be made carefully.

REMARKS ABOUT IT. 

" What you don't know, don't worry you." 

Lizzie. 
American Pie. 

" Tough and indigestible above; more tough and indi- 
gestible below, with untold horrors between'" 

The English Tourist. 

Pie. 

The greatest obstacle to the advancement of the Amer- 
can nation. It is making a race of dyspeptics. 

The Reformer. 

As this book is not written to retard progress, but to 
help it on, there are in it no recipes for the ordinary pie, 
the crust shortened with lard, because other desserts are 
more wholesome. But English fruit pies, sometimes 
called by us " Apple Cobblers," " Peach Cobblers," etc., 
are very good. Below are general directions for making 
them. 

English Fruit Pies. 

Take a deep earthen dish and fill it with any fruit,, 
adding sugar, spices or any seasoning desired. Lay over 
the top of this a thick biscuit crust and bake until well 
done. Serve with cream or with some liquid sauce. 
Fruit pies made in this way have no heavy undercrust, 
soaked with fat and juice, but are very appetizing and 
digestible. 



eJELLy, 



GENERAL DIRECTIONS. 

i. The fruit must not be too ripe. 

a. The juice should drip from the bag without press- 
ure. 

3. There should be equal parts of juice and sugar, 
cup for cup. 

4. The jell)' is cooked enough when it drops clear 
from the spoon . 

5. Great care must be taken to skim well after juice 
cand sugar boil up together. 

6. Put into jelly glasses. When cool and settled, lay 
'over the top a piece of writing paper cut to fit smoothly 

and dipped in good brandy or alcohol. Then screw on 
the tops. 

Currant Jelly. 

Take a box of good, sound currants and pick them 
-.over carefully but do not remove stems. Put them into 
^preserving kettle, warm them all through and mash with 
,a spoon. Have a bag of cheese cloth, fill it with fruit, 
\tie up and let the juice drain from it. The jelly is better 
•if the fruit is not squeezed. When well drained, measure 
the juice. Boil for ten minutes, then add an equal quan- 
tity of sugar, cup for cup and boil ten minutes longer, or 
until it will drop from the end of a spoon. 



JELLY. 91 

Crab Apple Jelly. 

Wash and cut into halves nice crab apples. Put over 
fire in preserving kettle with a little boiling water. Stir 
constantly to keep from burning. When done, put the 
jelly into a bag, and let it drip from it. When the juice 
stops dripping, add to it an equal amount of sugar, meas- 
uring first a cup of juice, then of sugar. Boil until done. 
This takes longer than currant jelly. It is done when it 
drips clear from the spoon. 

Raspberry Jelly. 

Pick over thoroughly and wash two boxes (jo quarts) of 
raspberries. Put in preserving kettle and let them warm 
up to form juice, then in bag to drain. To every cup of 
juice add one cup of sugar. Boil hard ten minutes, skim- 
ming carefully the while. When done, the jelly will 
drop from the spoon. 

Grape Jelly. 

Mash well some sour grapes and put into a preserving 
kettle with a little water to cook. Stir to keep from 
burning. When done put into a bag, hang the bag and 
let the juice drain until clear, then add sugar, cup for 
cup, and cook until done. This jelly requires more cook- 
ing than any other kind. 

Lemon Telly. 

Take one half box Cox's gelatine and soak in one half 
cup cold water. When soaked, add one coffee cup sugar, 
juice of two lemons and one rind. Allow it to remain in 
the kettle about two minutes. Then strain through a 
linen cloth into molds. 



92 lizzie's cook book. 

Raspberry Jam. 

To 12 lbs. nice fruit, add 6 lbs. sugar and let it stand 
twenty-four hours. Then put into preserving kettle and 
boil up well. Add 5 lbs. more of sugar and boil three- 
fourths of an hour, stirring all the time. When well 
done, put in jelly glasses and seal. 

Blackberry Jam. 
May be made in the same way. 

Pickled Figs. 

Figs, 6 lbs. 

Sugar, 3 " 

Vinegar (good,) 1 qt. 

A little cloves, allspice and cinnamon in a bag. L,et 
the figs stand over night in a weak solution of salt and 
water. Wipe well in the morning. Let the sugar and 
vinegar become scalding hot, put in the figs rnd boil un- 
til soft. Takeout carefully, put into a jar and pour the 
liquor over. Repeat this process two or three times. 

Bottled Peaches. 

To thirty lbs. of peaches, pared and halved, take 15 
lbs. sugar. To one-half the sugar add enough water to 
melt it. When it boils, drop in half the peaches, let them 
remain on the stove five minutes, then bottle. Use other 
half of the fruit in the same way. (Always have bottles 
hot.) 

Bottled Apricots. 

Same recipe as for peaches. 

Apricot Marmalade. 
To 10 lbs. apricots, pared and stoned, use 7 lbs. sugar. 



JELLY. 93 

Add to the apricots one-half the sugar and let them stand 
over night. Then put on stove, and let them come to 
boiling point. Then add remainder of the sugar and 
boil four hours. One-half hour before it is done, add 
i doz. blanched and chopped apricot stones. Put in 
jelly glasses. 

Bottled Pears. 

Pare fruit and cut in halves. To every 10 lbs. of fruit 
use 7 lbs. sugar. Add to sugar one pint boiling water 
and juice of one lemon. Boil to a syrup. Then add the 
fruit. Let it cook about one-half hour. Watch care- 
fully. 

Some prefer cooking pears about fifteen minutes in 
clear water before putting in the syrup. 



©ANN£© F^UlT. 



Use glass jars and clean them thoroughly. Prepare 
the fruit, which should not be too ripe, by paring, ston- 
ing or whatever is necessary. As the fruit is prepared, 
place it carefully in the jars, taking care not to break it. 
Prepare the syrup, sweet according to the acidity of the 
fruit, and the taste. Boil and skim the syrup. Set the 
jars in a boiler prepared for canning. If that cannot be 
procured, take a common boiler. Lay a board in the 
bottom of it and set the jars filled with the fruit in the 
boiler, pouring more water around them to about half 
their height. Put the covers on loosely, but do not screw 
them down. As soon as the water is hot, pour on hot 
syrup and cook them twenty minutes. Then fill with 
syrup to the brim and screw on the tops. Take out of 
boiler, and set to cool. If not perfectly air-tight, they 
will leak and the process must be repeated. 



©fflNKS. 



Coffee. 

Buy Mocha or Java coffee ground coarse. Take one 
tablespoonful for every person and one for the pot. Beat 
up an egg and mix some or all of it with the coffee. 
Then stir up the mixture well with two tablespoonfuls of 
cold water. When well mixed, pour on the boiling 
water about ten minutes before serving. Keep hot but 
do not let it boil. 

Coffee, No. 2. 

MADE WITH COI.D WATER. 

Take coffee in the same proportions as above according 
to the number of persons. Stir it up thoroughly with a 
little cold water, just enough to soak the grains. When 
thoroughly soaked, add a cup of cold water for every per- 
son and one for the pot. Mix all thoroughly, place over 
a hot fire and take cff as seen as it toils. It will te 
clear as amber and very good. This is an excellent way 
to make coffoe over a spirit lamp. 

In buying coffee instead of all Java, many persons pre- 
fer a mixture of one-third Mocha and two-thirds Java. 
Those who are fond of strong coffee sometimes prefer 
one-third Costa Rica and two-thirds Java. Leading groc- 
ers now often make their own mixtures, called "Blended 
Coffee." Always have the coffee berry freshly ground or 
the aroma escapes and the delicious flavor is lost.

Cocoa Shells. 

This is not a favorite drink, but when well made is 
very good, especially for delicate stomachs. Put two 
handfuls of shells into a pot and pour over them one pint 
of boiling water. Boil well for at least one-half hour, 
then add one pint of good milk. Let it just boil up, 
after adding the milk. If too strong, add more milk. 

Chocolate. 

Reliable directions for making chocolate are printed on 
the packages. 

Tea. 

Have an earthen tea-pot, heat it well and measure into 
it one teaspoonful of tea for every person, and one for the 
pot. Pour boiling water over this, one cup for every 
spoonful of tea if it is to be of good strength. Let it 
stand in a warm place. Never boil tea; it makes a bitter 
and unwholesome drink. Let the water just boil before 
pouring it over. Tea well made is a fragrant and re- 
freshing drink. Do not buy green teas for they are col- 
ored and sometimes poisonous.

Raw Beef Soup. 

Chop fine one pound of raw beef, put it in a bottle 
with one pint of water and five drops of muriatic acid. 
Let this stand in a cool place all night. In the morning 
set the bottle in a pan of water at no degrees F., for 
about two hours. Strain through a cloth until the mass 
is nearly dry. If the raw taste be objectionable, the beef 
to be used should be roasted quickly on one side, then 
make as above. This soup ma} 7 be substituted for milk 
when the latter is called for, but cannot be taken. 

Beef Tea. — (Best way.) 

Three pounds of beef cut into dice and thrown into 
three pints of cold water. Let it stand three hours^ 
Add one-half teaspoonful salt, then cover and put it 
on a slow fire. Let it simmer, but never boil, until 
the quantity is reduced one-half. This will take six 
hours at least. Strain and set aside until next day, 
when skim, season, and serve hot. It should be per- 
fectly clear and of a golden brown color. 

Beef Tea, No. 2. 

A QUICK WAV TO MAKE BEEF TEA. 

Cut one-half pound of beef into dice, and put it into a_ 
wide mouthed bottle with just cold water enough to 



FOOD FOR INVALIDS. 105 

cover it. Cork the bottle, and put it in a sauce pan of 
cold water over a slow fire. When the water in the 
sauce pan boils, the tea is made. Strain, skim, season 
and serve hot. This makes about half a cup full. 

Beef Tea, No. 3. 

Half pound of beef chopped fine, and soaked in half 
pint cold water with a little salt, for ten minates. Then 
heat it slowly to boiling point, and let it boil three min- 
utes. Strain, skim, season, and serve hot. 

Beef Tea, No. 4. 

BEEF TEA THAT THE MOST DELICATE STOMACH CAN RETAIN. 

One pound of beef cut into dice and thrown into one 
pint cold water, with a pinch of salt. Add four drops of 
hydro chloric acid, cover, and let it stand half an hour. 
Skim, strain, season, and serve hot. Only to be given 
with the Doctor's consent. 

Beef Juice. 

Take one pound of beef cut into dice, and throw it 
into half a pint cold water. Let it stand twelve hours. 
Then strain, skim, heat quickly with a little salt, and 
serve hot. with a half slice thin, hot toast. 

Beef Juice, No. 2. 

Boil for one minute, one pound of beef. Then grate it 
fine by rubbing and tearing it on a large grater. Rub 
this through a sieve and you have a thickish liquid which 
can be drank, and yet contains the whole nourishment of 
the beef. Heat quickly with a little salt and serve. 



106 lizzie s cook book. 

Beef Tea and Egg. 

Beat a raw egg a little and stir it into a half pint of hot 
beef tea. 

Egg Nogg. 

Beat up well the yolk of an egg. Add slowly one 
tablespoonfnl of boiling water. Beat again. Add one 
teaspoonful of sugar. Beat again. Add slowly one 
tablespoonful of brandy, beating constantly. Have 
ready the white of the egg, beaten lightly. Stir it in 
thoroughly, and serve at once. 

Egg Nogg, No. 2. 

One egg; One tumbler of milk; 

One dessertspoonful of brandy ; 

" " " sugar. 

Carefully scald the milk and let it afterwards become 
cold. Beat the sugar and eggs together to a froth, put 
into a glass, add the brandy and fill up with the milk. 
Can be made quickly if desired without boiling the milk. 

Baked Milk. 

Put the milk into a stone-ware jar and cover with 
foolscap writing paper tied over it. Set it in a moderate 
oven for two or three hours according to quantity. This 
is very delicate when made properly. Experience will 
guide as to heat of oven. The paper allows for slow 
evaporation. 

Macaroni and Milk. 

Take three pieces of curled macaroni, soak in pint of 



FOOD FOR INVALIDS. 107 

warmed milk until quite swollen and soft. Add pinch 
of salt, and boil slowly for twenty minutes. 

Milk Punch. 

One tumblerful of milk; two dessertspoonfuls brandy. 
Sweeten the milk well and stir in the brandy thoroughly. 
Keep very cold with ice. 

Kumys. 

Three quarts fresh, rich milk; Three quarts hot water; 
Half a pound of white sugar; one tablespoonful of good 
yeast. Dissolve the sugar in the hot water, add this to 
the milk, and let them cool until lukewarm. Now, slowly 
and carefully stir in the yeast. Set the crock containing 
this in a warm place to rise as you would bread. In five 
or six hours, it will be slightly sparkling, and small bub- 
bles will rise to the surface when stirred. When it 
reaches this stage, put it into stout bottles, tie down the 
corks, and set bottles in a cool place, in the refrigerator 
or on the floor of a cool cellar. A thick mass (the case- 
ine) will form on the surface; once or twice a day, for 
several days, the bottle should be well shaken, and this 
will fall in a powder to the bottom. When two days old, 
it is ready for use, although it will keep for a much 
longer time, and may be used when a week or more old. 
It is best, however, when two to four days old. Care 
must be used in opening. Use a champagne faucet if 
possible. 

Corn Meal Grukl. 

Take a quart of boiling water, stir into it 2 tablespoon- 
fuls of corn-meal and y 2 teaspoon ful of salt. Boil hard 
for 1 hour, stirring constantly. Milk may be added to 
s, if agreeable to the invalid. 



108 lizzie's cook book. 

Farina Gruel. 

Take a pint of boiling water and stir into it 2 table- 
spoonfuls of farina and y 2 teaspoonful of salt. Stir con- 
stantly while it boils half an hour. 

Oat Meal Gruel. 

Take a pint of Irish oat-meal and pour upon it a quart 
of cold water. Let it stand three hours, stirring occasion- 
all} 7 . When well soaked drain off the water and put the 
water into a double kettle to boil, adding ^ teaspoonful 
of salt. Let it boil slowly for one hour. Milk ma} 7 be 
added, if agreeable to the patient. 

Milk Gruel.— (With flour.) 

Put a pint of milk in a double kettle and let it boil. 
Blend a tablespoonful of flour and Vs teaspoonful of salt 
with a little water, and stir it into the boiling milk, stir- 
ring constantly until it thickens. 



HUSBANDS- 



A RECIPE FOR COOKING HUSBANDS. 

One of the lectures before the Baltimore Cooking 
School recently gave this recipe for cooking husbands: 
' 'A good many husbands are utterly spoiled by misman- 
agement. Some women keep them constantly in hot 
water. Others let them freeze by their carelessness and 
indifference. Some keep them in a stew by irritating 
ways and words; others roast them. Some keep them in 
a pickle all their lives. It cannot be supposed that any 
husband will be tender and good, managed in this way, 
but he is truly delicious when properly treated. In se- 
lecting }^our husband you should not be guided by the 
silvery appearance, as in buying a mackerel, nor by the 
golden tint, as if you wanted a salmon. Be sure to se- 
lect him yourself, as tastes differ. Do not go to market 
for him, as the best are always brought to your door. It 
is far better to have none, unless you will patiently learn 
how to cook him. A preserving kettle of the finest por- 
celain is the best, but if you have nothing but an earthen 
pipkin it will do, with care. See that the linen in which you 
wrap him is nicely washed and mended, with the required 
number of buttons and strings tightly sewed on. Tie him in 
the kettle by a strong silk cord called comfort, as the one 
called duty is apt to be weak. Make a clear, steady fire out 
of love, neatness and cheerfulness. Set him as near this 
as seems to agree with him. If he sputters and fizzes, do 



no lizzie's cook book. 

not be anxious ; some husbands do this till they are quite 
done. Add a little sugar, in the form of what confection- 
ers call kisses, but no vinegar or pepper on any account. 
A little spice improves him, but it must be used with 
judgment. Do not stick any sharp instrument into him 
to see if he is becoming tender. Stir him gently, watch- 
ing the while, lest he lie too flat and close to the kettle, 
and so become useless. You can not fail to know when 
he is done. If thus treated, 3 t ou will find him very re- 
liable, agreeing nicely with you and the children, and 
he will keep as long as you want, unless you become 
careless and set him in too cold a place."
