SOUP. 



"The beat soups ure mude with a blending of 
many flavors. Don't be afraid of experimenting 
with tliem. Where yon make one mistake you 
will be surprised to find the number of successful 
varieties you can produce. If you like a spicy 
flavor try two or three cloves, or allspice, or bay 
leaves. All soups are improved by a dash of onion, 
unless it is the white soups, or purees from chicken, 
veal, fish, etc. In these celery may be used. In 
nothing as well as soups cau a liousekeepcr be 
economical of the odds and ends of food loft from 
meals. One of the best cooks was in the habit of 
saving everything, and announced one day, when 
her soup was especially praised, that it contained 
the crumbs of gingerbread from her cake box ! 
Creamed onions left from a dinner, or a little stewed 
corn, potatoes mashed, a few baked beans — even a 
small dish of apple sauce have often added to the 
flavor of soup. Of course, all good meat gravies, 
or bones from roast or boiled meats, can be added 
to your stock pot. A little butter is always needed

in tomato soup. In making stock, use a quart of 
water for every pound of meat and bone. Cut the 
meat in pieces, crack the bones, place all in the 
kettle, pour over it the proper quantity of cold 
water ; let it soak a while on the back of the range 
before cooking. Let soup boil slowly, never hard, 
(an hour for each pound of meat) strain through a 
sieve or coarse cloth. Never let the fat remain on 
your soup. Let get cold and lift it off, or skim it 
off hot. 

BROWN STOCK 



MRS. W. COOK. 

Four pounds shin of beef, or other meats andi 
bones — four carrots, four onions, one turnip, one 
small head of celery, one half tablespoonful of salt^ 
one half teaspoonful of peppercorns, six cloves, five 
pints of cold water. Cut up the meat bone and 
place it in a large saucepan, pour over the water^ 
skim when boiling, prepare the, vegetables, add them 
to the saucepan ; cover closely and boil slowly four 
hours. The spice should be added with the veget- 
ables.

pick over and wash the rice, rinse it well in cold 
water, and put it in a thick saucepan over the fire 
with a pint of milk and a teaspoonful of salt ; wash 
s, head of celery and grate the white stalks, letting 
the grated celery fall into milk enough to cover it ; 
put the grated celery with the rice and gently sim- 
mer them together until the rice is tender enough to 
rub through a sieve with a potato masher, adding 
more milk if the rice absorbs what has first been 
put with it. After the rice has been rubbed 
through the sieve, return it to the saucepan, place 
it again over the fire, and gradually stir with it 
the quart of stock or broth ; if this quantity of 

stock does not dilute the soup to a creamy consis- 
tency, add a little milk ; let the soup get scalding 

hot, season it with salt, white pepper, and a very 

little grat^^d nutmeg, and serve at once.

N 



Scale and clean fresh herrings, then taking the 
iish by the tail you can easily remove the backbone 
drawing it towards the head. The smaller bones 
will melt in the vinegar ; remove the heads and 
roll each fish up, tail end inside, and wind a thread 
round each roll, lay them in the vessel they are 
to remain in till used, a stone earthernware crock 
is best. Make scalding hot with spices as much 
vinegar as will cover them, pour it over the fish 
and keep thqm hot about the stove for about an 
hour, when they will be well cooked through ; do 
not let them boil or they will break. Keep in a 
cool place. Spices : whole white pepper, whole 
allspice, and a blade of mace if it is liked.

MR8. DAVID BELL. 



To make beefsteak tender, rub a pinch of baking^ 
Boda on each side of the steak about an hour before 
cooking and roll it up on itself in the meantime. 
A very small pinch of brown sugar used in the 
same way is good, but the soda is thought prefer- 
able.

MRS. DUNCAN LAURIE. 



Take the feet and legs of a pig, cut ofl: at the 
hams, two will be sufficient for a family of eight. 
Singe off the hair and thoroughly cleanse them, 
removing the toes by scorching. Cut the legs in 
pieces suitable for stewing, put down in cold 
water and cook slowly for three hours. Pare and 
cut up nine or ten good sized potatoes and add to 
your stew with salt and pepper, about one half an 
hour before dishing. After the potatoes have been 
put in, the greatest care must be taken to prevent 
them from sticking to the pot and burning, there- 
fore you must stir frequently with a spoon. What 
remains from dinner pour into a mould and it will 
become a jelly, which is nice eaten cold for break- 
fast.

ROAST DUCK WITH APPLES. 

MIS8 HEEMKR. 

Pluck and Hingo a duck, draw it witliout broak- 
iutij the intestines, wipe it with a wet towel and 
lay it in a baking pan ; wipe a dozen small sour 
apples with a wDt cloth, cut out the cores without 
breaking the a[)ple8, and arrange them around the 
duck ; put the pan into a hot oven and quickly 
brown the duck, then moderate the heat of the oven 
and continue the cooking for abouL twenty minutes, 
or until the apples are tender but not broken, baste 
both duck and apples every five minutes until they 
are done, and t .en serve them on the same dish. 
It ia a great improvement some think, to parboil 
the duck for fifteen minutes with an onion in the 
water, and the strong fishy flavor that is some- 
times so disagreeable in wild ducks will have disap- 
peared. A carrot will answer the same purpose.

VEGETABLES. 



" Cheerful cooks make every diali a feast."' — Massinuku. 



Always have the water boiling when you put 
your vegetables in, and keep it constantly boiling 
until they are done. Cook each kind by itself 
when convenient.' All vegetables should be well 
seasoned. 

APPLES. 



MRS. DAVID BELL. 

When the barrel of apples you have bought, 
beginn to make your mind uneasy, because they can 
spoil faster than you can use them, a good plan is 
to peel, core and stir them witb a very little sugar 
and screw them down in your jam jars. They will 
keep for a couple of months and will be handy to 
fill a tart or as apple sauce, etc. ; they do not need 
to be cooked too much and somo of the firmer sorts 
may remain in quarters solid enough for a pie. 
Another plan is to peel but not core the suspicious

ftpples, put them in your baking pan, scatter a little 
sugar over them and put them in a quick oven 
without letting them thaw, when done, they should 
each be whole and a pretty brown color. 

BEANS. 

Beans are a nice winter vegetable, but cooked 
with pork as " baked beans," are too strong for 
daily use, but are a desirable article of food cooked 
more plainly. Choose the small white beans, put 
them in a saucepan with as much cold water, as 
will cover them well and a small pinch of baking 
soda ; when they have simmered a few minutes 
drain oH' the water and replace it with hot water 
and a little salt ; if possible let them cook without 
boiling hard ? when tender drain, and dish with a 
liberal piece of butter and a dust of pepper. They 
are also good thrown when drained into the frying 
pan w ith some dripping, pepper and salt, and heated 
a few minutes over the lire. The only attention 
they require in cooking is lest they melt into soup 
when nearly cooked. 

FRIED BKETS. 

MRS. DUNCAN LAURIE. 

Boil until tender, slice and put in stewpan with a 
teaspoon of vinegar, half the juice of a lemon, one 
half teaspoonful each sugar and salt, a grate of

" T'is celery surely I see, 

And mayonnaise yellow and thick and rich, 
What may this rare flavor be."

And my salad was made in a trice."

PIES.

Who flare deny the tnuh, there's poetry in pie." — LoNciKKM.ow 



" Ingenuity, good judgment and great care 
should be used in making all kinds of pastry. Use 
very cold water, and just as little as* possible ; roll 
thin and always from you ; prick the bottom crust 
with a fork to prevent blistering ; then brush it 
well with the white of egg, and sprinkle thick 
'with granulated sugar. This will give you a firm 
rich crust. 

For all kinds of fruit pies, prepare the bottom 
cruet as above. Stew the fruit and sweeten to 
taste. If juicy put a good la3'^er of corn-starch on 
top of the fruit before putting on the top crust. 
TKis will prevent the juice from running out, and 
will form a nice jelly throughout the pie. Be sure 
you have plenty of incisions in the top crust ; then 
pinch it closely around the edge ; sprinkle some 
granulated sugar on top, and bake in a moderate 
oven.

CAKES. 



" With weights and measures just and true, 
Oven of even heat, 
Well buttered tins and quiet nerves, 
Success will be complete." 



" In making «ake, the ingredients should be ol 
the first quality — the flour super-fine, and always 
sifted ; the butter fresh and sweet and not too much 
salted. Cofiee A, or granulated sugar is best for 
cakes. Much care should be taken in breaking 
and separating the eggs, and equal care taken as 
regards their freshness. Break each Qgg separately in 
a teacup ; then into the vessels in which they are 
to be beaten. Never use an Qgg when the white 
is the least discolored. Before beating the whites 
remove every particle of yolk. If any is allowed 
to remain, it will prevent them becoming as stiff 
and dry as required. Deep earthen bowls are best 
for mixing cake, and a wooden spoon or paddle is 
best for beating batter. Before commencing to 
make your cake, see that all the ingredients re- 
quired are at hand. By so doing the w^ork may be 
done in much less time.

* The lightness of a cake depends not only upon 
the making, but the baking also, . It is highly 
important to exercise judgment respecting the heat 
of the oven, which must be regulated according to 
the cake you bake, and the stove you use. Solid 
cake requires sufficient heat to cause it to rise and 
brown nicely v/ithout scorching. If it should 
brown too fast cover with thick brown paper. All 
light cakes require quick heat and are not good 
if baked in a cool oven. Those having molasses 
as an ingredient scorch more quickly, consequently 
should be baked in a moderate oven. Every cook 
should use her own Judgment, and by frequent 
baking she will in a very short time be able to tell 
by the appearance of either bread or cake whether 
it is sufficiently done.'

Hi 



To can strawberries, raspberries or plums : to each 
pound of sugar add one half pint of water, boil till 
you have a rich syrup, lot stand till cold ; have your 
jars packed full of raw fruit (not crushed) and fill 
with the cold syrup, put on the covers and screws, 
(not the rubber rings,) and place in cold water up 
to the neck of the jars, you will need straw or chips 
between the jars to prevent them touching each 
other or burning on the bottom, let the water boil 
for fifteen mhiutes, have some hot syrup to fill jars, 
put on rubber rings, screw up tightly and keep in 
a cool dark place.

ning the same as whole fruit. They are convenient

for water ices and summer beverages. Mash the 
fruit and rub the pulp through a fine sieve. Mix 
about three pounds of sugar with one quart of fruit 
juice and pulp. Fill Mason's jars with the syrup, 
cover and place in a heater with cold water to cover 
nearly to the top of the jar. Let the water boil 
half an hour, then fill each jar to the brim, seal 
and cool in the water. 

TO BRANDY PEACHES. 

To three pounds of sugar add a pint and a half 
water ; boil and skim it ; prepare eight pounds of 
ripe clingstone peaches : wash and rub with a coarse 
towel until all the down is ofi^, then pierce them 
with a fork and throw them into the syrup and 
boil them until a sharp straw can punctuate them : 
as they soften put them into your jar, which must 
be kept closely covered. Boil your syrup until it 
thickens, while hot, add a quart of the best brandy 
and throw it over your peaches, tie the jar down 
closely. 

CURRANT JELLY. 



Currants should not be over ripe. Equal parts of 
red and white currants or currants and raspberries 
make a delicately colored and flavored jelly. Pick 
over and remove the leaves and poor fruit, and if 
filthy wash and drain them but do not stem them. 
Mash them in a porcelain kettle with wooden 
pestle without heating as that makes the jelly dark. 
Let them drain in a flannel bag over night. Do not

squeeze them, or the jelly will be cloudy. In the 
morning measure a bowl of sugar for each bowl of 
juice, and heat the sugar carefully in an earthern 
■dish in the oven. Htir it often to prevent burning : 
boil the juice twenty minutes and skim thoroughly. 
Add the hot sugar and boil from three to five 
minutes or till it thickens on a spoon when exposed 
to the air. Turn at once into glasses and let them 
remain in the sun several days then cover with 
paper dipped in brandy and paste paper over the 
tops of the glasses. One who is authority on this 
subject recommends covering with melted paraf- 
fine, or putting a lump of paraffine in the jelly 
while still hot. After draining the juice, the cur- 
rants may be squeezed and a second quality of jelly 
made, it may not be clear but will answer for some 

purposes. 

CANDIED TEEL. 

MRS. DAVID BELL. 

Put the lemon or orange skins, in strong salt

simmer them in thin brown sugar syrup till clear ; 
take them out, place on a dish, and let them remain 
for a day or two. Boil the syrup till thick, then 
fill the skins with it and put away to dry.

cover with molasses. To a medium sized pumpkin 
put one ounce cloves and about a dessertspoon of 
ginger or as much as will taste ; let it boil until the 
pumpkin is quite soft. One half dozen apples (sour) 
just co-ed not peeled is a great improvement. The 
molasses must only come to the top of your pieces, 
not neajly cover them.

SCOTCH HAGGIS. 



]\ i. 



MRS. ANDREW T. LOVE. y 

Boil a sheep's draught for three quarters of an 
hour in as much water as will cover it. Grate 
down the liver and mince the heart and lights 
very fine. Mince two pounds of onions, and two 
pounds of beef suet, put in three or four handsful 
of oatmeal with pepper and salt to taste. Having 
these ingredients very well mixed, put them into 
the bag with a little of the boilings of the draught. 
Pick the bag well to prevent its bursting. It re- 
quires from three to four hours boiling, so if you 
make it a day or two before you intend using it, 
it is bettor to boil it it two hours after it is 
made, and two hours when going to use it. Great 
care must be taken in having the bag very par- 
ticularly scraped and cleansed by frequent wash- 
ings in salt and water. The liver and heart, etc., 
are better, to be boiled before, then they can be 
grated down easily. Half of this receipt makes 
a very good sized Haggis.
