PREFACE 



In compiling this cook book no attempt has been made 
to compete with the larger ones, as that would be well-nigh 
impossible, but merely to give some cherished recipes of 
old housewives from manuscript books which have been 
transmitted to them through generations. They have 
been thoroughly tried and proved successful and have 
been found to give the most satisfactory results at the 
least possible cost. The greater number have been 
obtained from women of New England ; quite a number 
were either contributed or dictated by Southern colored 
cooks of high reputation in the art and who seem to have 
a natural aptitude for that work; whilst a very few were 
given by people from foreign countries. The most of 
these recipes are designed for families who live well, but 
moderately, and who find it necessary to live in a plain 
and economical way. A very few are arranged for 
elaborate occasions. If these recipes are carefully and 
fairly tried, I feel that few, if any, will cause disappoint- 
ment, and that a new interest may be awakened in old- 
fashioned dishes, now almost extinct.

CHAPTER I. 

Bread, Breakfast Dishes and Beverages 
Hint : Bread must not be moved in the oven until after 
the first quarter, or until it has set or risen. The tempera- 
ture of the water used in making bread must be 98-100 
degrees F. 

MILK BREAD. (Prize recipe.) 
Dissolve Yi magic (dry) yeast cake in I pint of warm 
water, thicken with flour, add 2 tablespoons white sugar 
and 1 teaspoon salt; let this rise over night, or about 10 
hours. Scald 2 teacups of milk; when cool dissolve ^4 
teaspoon soda in the milk, add 1 quart of flour to the 
batter, stirring with a knife ; then add the milk and enough 
more flour to knead, until it will not stick to the fingers. 
Let it rise until light, knead it again, let it rise again, 
divide into 2 loaves, let it rise in the pan and bake 1 hour. 
This may be started about 10 A. M. and the bread made 
about 8 P. M., and let rise over night and bake in the 
morning. 

GRAHAM BREAD. 
One pint of milk, scalded, and cooled, Yz cup of sugar, 
1 teaspoon salt, % yeast cake dissolved in 34 c"P of 
lukewarm water, 4 or 5 cups of fine granulated wheat 
flour or \y 2 cups of white flour and 3^ cups of sifted 
graham flour. Mix in the order given into a dough, a 
little softer than for white bread ; let it rise till light, stir 
it down, pour into well-greased pans or, if stiff enough. 

7 



New England Cook Book 



into loaves. Let it rise again and bake a little longer 
and in a cooler oven than for white bread. This should 
be mixed in the morning, as when done at night it is liable 
to become sour. 

RUSK. 

Make a dough at night by the rule for Parker House 
rolls. In the morning make half the quantity into bread 
or biscuits; with the remainder add Yz cup of butter, I 
cup of sugar, 2-3 cup of currants, a little cinnamon and 
a little nutmeg, 1 egg well beaten ; mix and beat well 
with the hand; add enough flour to shape easily. Let it 
rise in the bowl, shape into small rounds, put them in a 
shallow cake pan, so to have them rise high, have a little 
sugar and milk in a cup dissolved; rub over the top of 
the biscuits and sprinkle with sugar. Bake at once in a 
moderate oven. 

STICK DOUGH. 

One cup of milk, scalded. Add 1-3 cup of butter, 2 
tablespoons of sugar, y 2 teaspoon salt. When lukewarm 
add the white of 1 egg well beaten and a quarter of a 
yeast cake dissolved in 3 tablespoons of lukewarm water. 
Then add about 4 cups of flour and knead about 10 
minutes. Let them rise in a cool place. If desired per- 
fectly dry, bake in a slow oven, but if liked soft inside, 
bake in an oven as hot as for bread. Roll into round balls, 
then roll long with no flour on the board. 
WATER BREAD. 

One table-spoon lard or drippings, 1 teaspoon salt, 2 



New England Cook Book 

tablespoons sugar, 2 cups boiling water, about 6 or 7 
cups of flour. Put the sugar, salt, lard in the mixing 
bowl, add 2 cups of boiling water to dissolve them. 
When cool add y 2 yeast cake dissolved in y 2 cup of 
lukewarm water and stir in the flour, adding it gradually 
after 5 cups are used, so that it will not be stiff; use just 
enough to knead, until smooth and elastic. Cover, let it 
rise over night, cut it down, divide into four parts, shape 
into loaves. Let it rise again in the pans. Bake about 
1 hour. 

DOUGH CAKES. 
Take a piece of bread dough, after it has risen and 
ready to be put into the pans, flour a board, roll out about 
Y* inch thick, cut in squares. Have a frying pan, about 
1-3 full boiling fat, put in your cakes and fry until brown, 
then turn and fry the other side, remove to griddle with- 
out being greased, put in oven, cover, and let them cook 
slowly for 10 minutes, or until well puffed up. Drain on 
brown paper, and serve hot. 

PARKER HOUSE ROLLS.

Let it rise over night or, if mixed in the day, about 3 
hours ; then add flour till stiff enough to knead ; knead

dients and beat well. If not stiff enough for a drop bat- 
ter, add a little more flour. Pour batter into a shallow 
pan and bake y 2 hour, or it may be baked in muffin 
pans instead. Part flour and corn meal may be used

1-3 cup of white flour, 2 teaspoons of baking powder, 2 
tablespoons of sugar, 1 teaspoon salt. Beat 2 eggs very

ture. Melt 2 tablespoons butter in a spider or shallow 
round pan, and pour the mixture into it, then pour over

19 



New England Cook Book 



a hot oven, at least 25 minutes. By using 4 tablespoons 
of butter, the egg may be omitted, and will be found to 
be very good. 

HOE CAKE.

ite dish. Scald with boiling water; pour on enough to 
make it stiff, but thoroughly wet. Add 1 large table- 
spoon butter and let the mixture cook on top of stove for 
10 minutes, stirring to prevent burning. Butter a pan

20 



New England Cook Book 



hot oatmeal and melted butter. Beat well and bake in a 
shallow pan for 25 minutes. This is delicious. 

ABOUT GRIDDLE CAKE BATTER. 

Hint: If you can drop a spoonful of the batter into 
the bowl containing the batter, and it lies on the sur- 
face, in a smooth heap, and only gradually sinks, you 
have the right consistency. If it lies in a heap, but has 
stiff, ragged edges, it needs more wetting. 

Let the batter stand for 5 minutes before frying cakes. 

Muffins and griddle cakes should be made light, by 
using butter or cream instead of a number of eggs, which 
toughen it instead. 

Sour milk is best for griddle cakes. 

Pastry flour should be used with baking powder ; bread 
flour in all recipes where yeast is used. 

The griddle must be merely greased by rubbing a piece 
of salt pork lightly over it when hot, then pour the batter 
on at once. 

BREAD GRIDDLE CAKES. (No. 2.) 

One pint of stale bread crumbs, 1 pint of scalded milk, 

1 heaping tablespoon butter. Pour the hot milk over the 
crumbs, add the butter and soak over night or until

CHAPTER III. 

Meat, Fish, Sauces and Croquettes 

HINTS ON COOKING MEAT. 

Meat should always be removed from paper as soon 
as it comes from market. 

Wipe meat with a damp cloth before cooking. 

The rule for broiling meat is to quickly sear each side, 
then remove it a little from the fire to finish cooking. 

When frying is desirable, always let the pan heat before 
putting in the fat, thus avoiding unnecessary smoke. 

When frying is done by immersion in deep fat, the 
article should always be drained on brown paper, unless 
in the case of doughnuts, when it is best to plunge them 
into rapidly boiling water and remove at once. 

Long, slow cooking is recommended for boiling meat, 
and when tough a pinch of soda or a little vinegar is 
added to make it tender. 

In roasting meat put some fat in the bottom of the pan 
and baste every 15 minutes; allow 20 minutes to the 
pound if liked well done; less time if liked rare. When 
done remove to hot platter. 

CURRY OF MUTTON. 
Cut 1 large onion fine and fry in 3 tablespoons of butter 
until it is a pale yellow. Mix 1 teaspoon of salt, 1 tea- 

40 



New England Cook Book 



spoon curry powder, 2 tablespoons of flour, a shake of 
pepper together, and add to the butter; then pour on 
1 pint of hot water and 1 cup of stewed and strained 
tomato slowly and mix well. Wipe and cut 2 pounds 
of lean mutton into small pieces and fry in hot fat (using 
the fat that had been removed). Add the meat to the 
sauce and simmer slowly until tender. 

BREAKFAST BACON. 
Cut the bacon into thin slices. Grease a broiler with 
the rind that has been removed and put in the bacon. 
Set the broiler into a dripping pan and put it into a hot 
oven. Cook until bacon is crisp, from 10 to 15 minutes. 
Drain on brown paper. The grease may be saved for 
frying purposes. 

BREAKFAST BACON. (No. 2 ) 
Cut off the rind and slice very thin ; cook in a frying 
pan until the fat is tried out and bacon is crisp. Drain 
on paper and serve. 

FRIZZLED BEEF. 
Take ^2 pound of smoked beef, cut into fine shavings. 
Pour warm water over it and let it simmer for 15 minutes. 
Drain and heat it in 2 tablespoons of butter. Make a 
cup of thin white sauce ; pour it over 1 egg, well beaten ; 
add the beef and season with salt and pepper. Serve

rub over with salt, pepper and dredge with flour and l /\. 
cup of drippings. Place in a hot oven, so as to sear the 
surface and keep the juices in. After the flour has 
browned, reduce the heat and baste with the fat; if meat 
is quite lean, put in some of the fat that has been cut off. 
Baste every 15 minutes, this making the meat more juicy. 
When meat is half done, turn it over, dredge with flour, 
baste, and have the skin well browned.

utes. This makes a dry stuffing. 

CHESTNUT STUFFING. 
Roast 1 pint of chestnuts and peel off the outer and 
inner skin. Take 1/2 pound and simmer in stock enough 
to cover ; drain and let them cool ; then pound them in a 
mortar with 4 tablespoons of butter, 3 ounces of bread

TO BOIL A HAM. 
Soak over night in cold water. Scrub well; trim off 
the hard black part, cover with cold water, add a few 
cloves, a sprig of thyme and 2 bay leaves, and let it 
simmer slowly, allowing half an hour to the pound.

pinions. Put ]/ 2 an onion in the body of the duck. Wipe, 
truss, dredge with salt, pepper, butter and flour. Roast 
in a very hot oven about 45 minutes. As ducks should 
be cooked rare, it is best not to stuff them. Squeeze the 
juice of 1 lemon over each one and serve with currant 
jelly and gravy made as for turkey, or serve with a sauce 
made of equal quantities of butter, currant jelly and port 
wine; melt the butter, add the jelly and, when melted, 
pour in the wine; bring to the boiling point and serve 
with the duck.

come off easily ; wipe and dry inside and out. Take the 
gizzard, heart and liver and chop fine, adding 3 or 4 
shallots and 1 red pepper pod, finely minced, and 2 table- 
spoons of butter, melted. Stuff the bird with this mix- 
ture. Make a bouquet of a sprig of thyme, a little 
parsley, a couple of bay leaves and 2 or 3 cloves, and 
fasten to the breast; roll the duck in a wet cloth and 
wrap a cord around it; put into boiling salt water to cover 
and cook for 30 minutes or until thoroughly done. Re- 
move the cloth and bouquet, place on a hot dish, garnished

POINTS TO REMEMBER. 

This is the formulae for most sauces : Melt the butter, 
put in the flour, to which has been added all the dry 
seasonings ; stir till the mixture bubbles all over ; then 
gradually add the hot liquid, beating after each addition 
before putting more in. The constant beating renders it 
smooth and glossy as nothing else can make it. Cook 
slowly for a few minutes; if too thick add more hot 
liquid. 

HOW TO ADD YOLKS OF EGGS TO SOUPS 
AND SAUCES. 
In adding yolks of eggs to soups and sauces (to insure 
richness), beat yolks very light, add a little of the hot 

62

liquid and mix until smooth; then add enough more to 
have it pour easily. 

TO BROWN FLOUR.

HINTS ON COOKING VEGETABLES. 

The principle underlying the cooking of vegetables are 
the softening of the cellulose, the cooking of the starch 
properly, the saving of the proteids and minerals and 
rendering the proteids more digestible and the develop- 
ment of flavor. 

Firm vegetables, as roots or fibres, are best baked; 
owing to the high temperature of the oven, the bursting 
of the starch cells takes place properly. 

Any green vegetable is best cooked slowly in its own 
juice, thus retaining the mineral salt. 

79 



New England Cook Book 



All green vegetables should be cooked with the sauce 
pan uncovered. 

Have them as fresh as possible, and cook on day they 
are gathered. Pick over, and cut off any decayed leaves 
and wash in several waters. Put vegetables, when pared, 
into cold water to prevent discoloration, until ready to 
cook in boiling salted water.

CHAPTER VI. 

Pastry and Cake 

HINTS ABOUT PASTRY. 

A marble slab is an ideal arrangement for rolling pastry. 
The following rules are necessary to insure a perfect pie : 

First. Pound the pastry well until it is filled with air 
spaces. 

Second. Always put in a cool place to chill. 

Third. Rub the undercrust with the white of an egg 
before putting in the mixture, to prevent it from soaking 
into the pastry. 

Fourth. Place it in a hot oven. 

Fifth. Place on the floor of the oven, later put on top 
to brown. 

The secret of good pastry is to have it rich, without 
being greasy ; and flaky, without being brittle. 

Pastry flour is a necessity and should be sifted before 
using. 

Work it as quickly and lightly as possible. 

% PASTRY. 

Three cups of flour, }% cup of butter, ^ cup lard or 
drippings, I teaspoon of baking powder and a pinch of

served quinces, will add greatly; mix vigorously with 
a wooden spoon. Cover the crock closely and set away 
to mature from 2 to 6 weeks. If it dries out during that 
period, add a little liquor from time to time. When ready 
to make into pies, add apples, allowing 3 juicy apples to

HINTS ON CAKE MAKING. 

These are some of the essentials necessary — good 
materials, fresh eggs, best butter, pastry flour, pow- 
dered, fine granulated or light brown sugar. In winter, 
the eggs should not be cold, but put in a warm place ; in 
summer, chill them with the coldest water. The flour, 
heated, either by placing where the sun will shine on it 
or putting it in a bag and placing it in the oven where it 
will heat through, then sift twice. 

Sugar should be sifted and dried, but not made hot. 
136 



New England Cook Book 



Do not make the batter too stiff. 

Make as soon after breakfast as possible (unless a 
gas oven be used), as then the fire is at its best. 

Use the hand for final beating. 

In beating eggs, do not leave off when the eggs become 
foamy, as they are then only beginning to be light, but 
continue beating until the froth and bubbles have dis- 
appeared and the surface is smooth. 

The secret of making good cake is to beat it thoroughly 
after all ingredients have been put in. 

In all sorts of sponge cake mixture or cakes made 
without butter, flour must always go in last, and 
be folded in slowly and lightly, for if the flour is stirred 
in hard, the cake will be tough and leathery. Sponge cake 
when cut should look coarse grained and rough. 

In baking, cake may be moved during the first quarter, 
but not afterwards. 

Sprinkle a little flour on a piece of white paper and lay 
it on the oven floor. If the flour browns without burning 
in 5 minutes the oven is right for all cake and bread, 
excepting sponge and pound cake, when it should turn 
yellow. 

To bake cake, divide the time into quarters. In the 
first quarter, the cake begins to rise ; in the second quarter, 
it continues rising and begins to brown; in the third, it 
continues to brown, and in the last quarter, it finishes 
browning and shrinks from the pan. To remove the 

137 



New England Cook Book 



cake, stand the pan on its side, so as to let the weight of 
the cake help it out. 

Never slam the oven door, open and close it gently. 

To slice fruit cake without crumbling, use a very sharp, 
thin knife blade, cutting when needed into thick slices, to 
be afterwards cut into desired size. 

CREAM CAKE. 
Two cups water, I cup butter, 2 cups flour, 6 eggs. 
Boil butter and water together and stir in the flour dry ; 
when it boils remove from the fire to cool, then add the

spoons on a buttered pan and bake in oven that is mod- 
erately hot for 25 minutes. When cool, split and fill

CHAPTER VII. 

Preserves and Pickling 

HINTS 

A few lumps of lime placed on the shelves of the store- 
room will keep pickles, jams, etc., from becoming mouldy. 
Renew occasionally. 

If grape or other small fruit juice fails to jelly, add a 
small quantity of apple juice and let all boil together. 

Do not gather currants or other small fruits after a 
rain, as then it is impossible to get the juice to jelly. 

Hard boiling causes jelly to crystallize. It should only 
simmer. Jellies should be covered closely and kept in a 
cool, dry, dark place. 

Loaf sugar, crushed and rolled fine, is best for pre- 
serving. 

PRESERVED QUINCES. 

Wipe, pare, quarter and remove the core and hard 
part. Weigh fruit and take an equal quantity of sugar. 
Put quinces into cold water and when all have been 
pared, drain; put into a preserving kettle, cover with 
cold water and cook over a slow fire until fruit is tender 
enough to be pierced with a fork; skim out and lay on 
a platter until all are cooked. Strain the water, add 
sugar and cook gently for 10 minutes, skimming until 

159 



New England Cook Book 



clear; then put in as many quinces as the syrup will cover. 
Simmer until the fruit turns a rich red. Lift out with a 
spoon, drop piece by piece into hot glass jars. Let the 
syrup cook a little longer or until very thick; pour over 
the quinces, filling almost to the top ; add I teaspoon 
of brandy, seal and keep in a cool, dry place. 

PRESERVED CRAB APPLE. 

Pare fine ripe apples and throw at once into cold 
water. Put the parings in the preserving kettle and cover 
with cold water and simmer about i hour. Strain off 
the water and put it back in the kettle. Add as many 
pounds of sugar as you have pounds of fruit, and cook 
until syrup is quite thick. Drop in a few apples at a 
time and cook until tender enough to be pierced with a 
fork. Lift out carefully and drop into glass bottles. 
Cook the syrup a little longer, pour over the apples and 
add i teaspoon of brandy and seal. Peaches may be done 
in the same way by cutting in halves and cooking the 
kernels with the parings. 

QUINCE MARMALADE. 

Take as many quinces as you may wish. Rub, pare, 
core and boil in a little water until soft ; put the cores and 
skins on to boil separately, in water enough to cover ; 
when soft strain liquor into the boiling quince mixture 
and rub through a sieve. Put on to cook again (stirring 
almost constantly) for y 2 hour, adding $4 as much sugar 

160 



New England Cook Book 



as fruit, measured after paring. When smooth and firm, 
put in jars, seal air-tight and keep in dry, cool place. 

ORANGE MARMALADE. 

Take 3 large seedless oranges and 2 large lemons (re- 
jecting seeds from lemons) and put into a meat chopper, 
and grind all together. Add 11 jelly tumblers of cold 
water ; let it stand 24 hours, then boil uncovered 1 hour. 
Remove from stove, add 4 pounds of granulated sugar 
and let stand another 24 hours. Then boil steadily for 
1 ]/ 2 hours. This quantity will fill about a dozen glasses. 

CURRANT JELLY. 

Currants should be quite ripe, but not owr-ripe. Pick 
over, wash, stem and put into a preserving kettle set on 
back of range until juice flows freely; mash with a 
wooden vegetable masher and strain through a coarse 
strainer. Turn the juice into a flannel bag and let drip 
into a vessel beneath, all night. In the morning measure 
juice and allow an equal amount of sugar. Put the juice 
into a preserving kettle and let it boil about 20 minutes 
(skim if necessary) ; add the sugar and cook until it 
thickens on a plate when exposed to the air. Turn at 
once into hot glasses, add y 2 teaspoon brandy and cover 
with paper pasted over the top. Keep in a cool, dry, 
dark place. 

WILD GRAPE JELLY. 

Select the grapes when not fully ripe. Wash and 

161 



New England Cook Book 



drain and make same as Currant Jelly. Ripe grapes 
with a handful of green ones gives a most delicately 
colored and flavored jelly. 

ELDERBERRY JELLY. 

Make same as currant jelly. Do not use for 2 or 3 
months, so it will thicken, it being more like a syrup at 
first. This is excellent for throat trouble. 

CRAB APPLE OR PORTER APPLE JELLY. 

Wash apples, remove stem and blossom ends, and cut 
into quarters (do not pare nor remove seeds). Put 
into a preserving kettle and cover with cold water and 
boil until soft; then put them into a coarse sieve and 
press out all the juice ; strain again through a flannel bag. 
Do not squeeze it, as that makes the jelly cloudy. Meas- 
ure the juice and allow i l / 2 pints of sugar to 1 quart of 
juice, and boil down just one-half ; then skim, and turn 
into glasses and add 1 teaspoon of brandy. Cover and 
keep in a cool, dry place. One part quince and four parts 
apple make a most delicious jelly ; in that case, use equal 
parts of juice and sugar. 

QUINCE JELLY. 

Follow directions for Apple Jelly, using quinces in 
place of apples. 

SPICED APPLES. 

A russet is generally chosen for this dish. Remove 
the core, but do not pare it. Stick 2 cloves in each apple. 

162 



New England Cook Book 



Make a syrup in the proportion of 4 pounds of sugar to 
1 quart of vinegar ; add the apples whole and cook until 
soft enough to be pierced with a straw. Then add 2 
ounces of cassia bud and 1 ounce of whole mace. Put 2 
ounces of ginger root, scraped and sliced, in the vinegar 
and sugar before you begin to cook the apples. This 
will take 7 or 8 pounds of fruit. 

SPICED CURRANTS. 

Three pounds of white sugar, 5 pounds of ripe cur- 
rants, 1 tablespoon each of cinnamon, cloves, nutmeg and 
allspice. Boil currants 1 hour, then add the sugar, spices

SPICED CURRANTS. (No. 2.) 
Fruit that is very ripe or soft makes excellent jam. 
Boil 7 pounds fruit y 2 hour or until very soft and well 
cooked; mash with a wooden spoon, then add 5 pounds 
sugar and return to the fire and boil slowly 1 hour longer, 
stirring often to prevent burning. When jam is done, 
add 1 pint of sharp cider vinegar, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, 
1 teaspoon ginger and y 2 teaspoon cayenne pepper. 

CHILI SAUCE.
