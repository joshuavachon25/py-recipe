PREFACE 



To THE Woman whose blessing it has been to live 
on the Eastern Shore of Maryland there is something 
indescribably fascinating in any Cook Book. Given a 
compilation of Kent County recipes, and a true house- 
keeper's cup of joy is full. The beckoning opportunity 
and prophetic challenge of every new recipe, added to 
the certainties of the tried and proven ones, stimulate 
ambition to the noble achievements of culinary nrt, 
surpassing even the triumphs of a region already justly 
proud of its good things to eat. 

The Epworth League of the Still Pond M. E. 
Church in presenting this Cook Book does not claim to 
have included all the cooking formulas that have made 
the Eastern Shore celebrated for its living, but it does 
assure its patrons that within its pages will be found 
such recipes, as are representative of Kent County and 
guarantees them all to be tested and proven ones. 
The League begs to thank all who have contributed 
recipes and co-operated in the work of producing this 
book. 

To all who have encouraged the League; to all 
who have made the labor of preparation lighter in any 
way; to the printer of these pages for many valuable 
suggestions and a scrupulous acuracy and discrimina- 
ting taste; hearty thanks arc given. 

Better dinners, better digestion, a long life to all. 



Still Pond Methodist Episcopal Church is 
the oldest continuously organized society of Metho- 
dists in the Delmarvia Peninsula. The great organizer 
of Methodism, Francis Asbury, established a preaching- 
place here in 1772. Worship has been maintained 
without interruption from that date until the present 
time, therefore, the church has a history covering a 
period of 147 years. The original church was erected 
before Washington was first made President of the 
United States. In 1852, the old church was replaced 
by a brick edifice, which, remodeled and refurnished 
in 1SS2, with additional improvements in 1912, stands 
as you see it to-day. 

This church extends a welcome to all its services. 
Rev. A. W. GOODHAND, Pastor.

SOUPS. 



Poor Man's Vegetable Soup. 

A delicious soup can be made from the trimmings of an 
ordinary, sized steak, if there is a small piece of marrow 
bone in it, and the bone of a smoked or sugar cured ham. 
The ham bone gives an unusual flavor, very pleasing, and 
the scraps of fresh meat give the richness. Half a cupful 
each of white potatoes, sweet potatoes, corn, tomatoes 
and finely cut cabbage, added after the bones and water 
(about two quarts) have boiled half an hour. Good soup 
depends largely upon the seasoning. Half an onion, chop- 
ped fine with parsley and celery, gives a good flavor, but 
if one can get dried thyme the soup is indeed savory. 
Vegetable soup ought to cook not less than one hour 
after the vegetables go in, but the longer the better. Just 
before putting the vegetables in, two tablespoonfuls of 
rice or barley should be added. Mrs. R. D. Moore. 

Vegetable Soup. 

Cut all the lean meat from a ham bone, add about a 
quart of water. Cut one onion in small pieces, add two 
large potatoes, cut in dice, and one pint of tomatoes, salt 
and pepper to taste. Let cook about one hour and serve 
hot. Mrs. Walter Moffett. 

Noodle Soup. 

Put shin bone on early in morning in cold water. Skim 
off any froth that comes to surface. Add salt, pepper, 



12 

onion and celery or parsley. Later add a few tomatoes. 
Put in noodles about one-half hour before serving and let 
cook slowly. Mrs. Charles Walter. 

Celery Soup. 
Two cupfuls finely cut celery (outer parts preferred), 
three cupfuls cold water, butter size of walnut, three cup- 
fuls milk, salt and pepper to taste. Boil until very tender, 
an hour is not too long. Then add milk, and let it come 
to boiling point, when, with butter and seasoning added, 
it is ready to serve. O. H. M. 

/- Peanut-Butter Soup. 

Three cups of milk, one cup of hot water, one-half cup- 
ful of peanut butter, one teaspoonful of salt, one-half tea- 
spoonful of nutmeg, one teaspoonful of cornstarch, a dash 
of pepper. While the milk is heating mix the peanut but- 
ter with the hot water until smooth ; then add to the boil- 
ing milk; mix the cornstarch with a little cold milk, and 
add to the hot milk; add the salt, pepper and nutmeg; 
boil for three minutes. Serve with small crackers. 

O. H. M. 
Mock Bisque. 

One can tomatoes, one-quarter teaspoonful soda, one- 
third cupful butter, one quart milk, one-third cupful flour, 
three teaspoonfuls salt, one-quarter teaspoonful pepper. 
Cook the tomatoes until soft, press through a strainer, 
and add soda to pulp. Melt the butter in a saucepan, add 
flour, salt and pepper. Add milk slowly, stirring con- 
stantly until it thickens, add the tomato juice and reheat, 
but do not let it boil. Edith W. Bell. 

Bean Soup. 

Wash thoroughly, soak over night in plenty of cold 
water. Put on in morning with piece of bacon and cook 
several hours. Half hour before serving add a few pota- 
toes cut in small pieces, pepper and salt, later add drop 
dumplings or noodles. Cook until done and serve. 

Mabel Norris. 

Potato Soup. 

Six large potatoes, one-half pint water, two and one- 
half cupfuls milk, two heaping tablespoonfuls butter, one 



13 

tablespoonful flour. Boil six large potatoes (sliced) with 
just enough water to cook well and so there will be about 
one-half cupful water in kettle when potatoes are done. 
Put through ricer, then add one-half pint of water, in 
which potatoes were boiled, the two and one-half cupfuls 
milk and season with celery-salt or parsley, salt and pep- 
per and butter. Mix tablespoonful of flour 'and little milk 
together and add to boiling soup. Mrs. E. C. Hepburn.

til it is light and spongy. Put lightly into glass dish or 
shape in mold. Serve with a thin custard made of the 
yolks of the eggs, or cream and sugar. Other fruit juices 
may be used, keeping the same proportions; when juice 
of less strength than that of lemon is used it may take 
the place of a part of the water. In this case the juice of 
one lemon to each quart of jelly will bring out the flavor 
of the fruit. K. C.

broth, add four tablespoonfuls powdered sugar and put 
over custard. Brown in slow oven. Mary C. Norris. 

Cup Custard. 

Though the usual rule for a custard is eight eggs to a 
quart of milk, a good custard can be made of six or even 
less eggs with the addition of a level tablespoonful of 
cornstarch thoroughly blended in the sugar before adding 
the ingredients. Beat eggs, sugar and milk and any Bee 
Brand Extract or flavoring you may like. Fill custard 
cups, sift a little Bee Brand nutmeg or cinnamon over the 
tops, set them in a moderate oven in a shallow pan half 
filled with hot water. In about twenty minutes try them 
with the handle of a teaspoon to see if they are firm. 
Judgment and care is needed to attain skill in baking cus- 
tard, for if left in the oven a minute too long or the fire is 
too hot the milk will certainly whey. — Taken from "Mc- 
Cormick's Manual of Cookery."

CAKE 



General Directions for Making Cake. 

Boat the butter to a cream. Cream the butter and sugar 
together; beat the whites and yolks of eggs separately. 

The yeast powder should be sifted through the flour; 
soda dissolved in sour milk or in a little warm water. 

The success of your cake depends much on having the 
flour well sifted and the other ingredients thoroughly 
beaten together before the flour is added, after which stir 
as little as possible. 

Currants* should be carefully picked over and washed in 
a colander until clean, then spread on tins before the fire; 
when dry, put away for use. Raisins should be seeded 
and cut or chopped, as preferred. 

To blanch almonds, pour on boiling water and rub off 
the skins. 

Fruit should be dredged with flour before putting it into 
the cake to prevent it settling. 

Be sure to have your oven at the right temperature. 

Also be careful not to jar cake after placing in over by 
slamming oven door, walking heavily across floor, etc., 
or else your cake is very apt to fall. 

It is recommended that only standard flavors and spices 
be used in these recipes. McCormick's Bee Brand is wor- 
thy of particular mention. 

Cup Cake.

Brown-stone Front. 

One-half cup butter, melted; two cups brown sugar, 
three eggs, two cups flour, two and one-half squares 
chocolate, melted in one-half cup hot coffee, one tea- 
spoonful soda, melted in one-half cup sour milk. Bake in 
layers and put together with caramel icing with chopped 
walnuts. Mrs. J. T. B. 

Watermelon Cake. 

White Par t : Two cups white sugar, one each of butter 
and milk, three and one-half cups flour, whites of five 
eggs, two teaspoonfuls cream of tartar and one of soda 
sifted several times with the flour. Red Par t : One cup 
sugar, one-half cup butter, one-third cup of milk, two 
cups flour, whites of four eggs, one teaspoonful cream of 
tartar and one-half teaspoonful of soda sifted several 
times with the flour, one teacup of large raisins. Cream 
the butter and sugar together (each part separately 
mixed), add slowly the milk; have the whites of the eggs 
beaten to a stiff froth; stir the prepared flour into the 
mixture, stirring until the batter is smooth; then stir in 
the whipped eggs and a few drops of red vegetable color- 
ing. Cut the raisins lengthwise, mix well with a little of 
the flour and stir in last. Use a well-buttered pan with a 
tube in it. Fill the white part around the outer edge of 
the pan, piling the red part around the tube, which should 
be done by two persons, else the parts are apt to run into 
each other. The raisins should only be used in the red 
part to represent seed. Cover the red part at the last 
with the white batter. Bake two hours in a slow oven. 
Coyer with green icing if you like . Mrs. Geo. W. Rash.

Checker-Board Cake. 

If this cake is not made with care and the batter is too 
thin, there will be no "checker board." 

Six eggs, whites only; two cups sugar, one cup sweet 
milk, three-quarters cup butter, four cups sifted flour, or 
three cups if you measure before you sift it; two tea- 
spoonfuls yeast powder .two teaspoonfuls lemon. Divide 
the batter into two equal parts and color one-half of it 
with dissolved chocolate. Drop the batter into layer pans 
in rings in this way. First place a small circle of the 
white batter in the center of the pan and carefully place 
around it a ring of the brown batter about one and one- 
half inches wide. Around the brown ring place another 
of white, then a brown one, continuing this way until the 
pan is filled, being careful to have the rings as nearly a 
uniform width as possible. In the next layer reverse the 
color scheme by beginning with the center ring brown 
and the next white and so on, alternating until the pan is 
filled. Reverse colors in each subsequent layer until all 
of the batter is used. Any good filling may be used be- 
tween the layers and the top may be iced or covered with 
the filling or dusted with powdered sugar.

ICINGS 



Boiled White Icing. 

To one-third cup of boiling water add gradually one 
cup granulated sugar. Boil until it spins a long thread, 
when pour slowly over the well-beaten white of one egg, 
beating all the while until cool, when spread. If a thick 
icing is desired, use double quantity or more, and as soon 
as the syrup begins to boil after sugar is added, take out 
a little by degrees, pouring over well-beaten egg and 



57 

beating constantly. The last to be added will thus be 

overdone, making up for the first that was taken out un- 
derdone. With care this makes a fine icing, flavor as 
desired. O. H. M.

CANDIES. 



Cream Fondant Candies. 

The secret of good candy is good fondant. To make 
the kind that will keep fresh for a long time, do not use 
either egg or cream of tartar. 



62 

Put three cups of XXXX sugar in a bowl or agate pan, 
pour in, while stirring, one-half cup of boiling water and 
continue to stir until all lumps are gone. Cover and let 
stand for an hour or two, then stiffen with more sugar 
until it can be handled and worked like light bread. Af- 
ter working until creamy, about five minutes, it is then 
ready to flavor and mold. 

Unless you want a great deal of one kind of candy, it is 
best to divide the batch of fondant and color and flavor 
each as you mold them. Add a little vanilla to a portion 
of it, pinch off a piece the size of a hazel nut, it will do to 
use as a walnut cream plain, with half nut on top or dip- 
ped in chocolate. In an olive shape use it for almonds, 
either plain or coated. One chunk of the fondant, flavored 
with maple sugar flavoring, rolled into a tiny cylinder, 
makes an ideal filling for stuffed dates. Peppermint 
creams are easily made by adding essence of peppermint 
to the plain fondant and pressing the balls flat in the 
palm of the hand. These may be colored green or pink 
by using a good vegetable coloring matter. 

Sweet potatoes are made as follows : Grate a fresh 
cocoanut and let dry out in the oven for a few minutes. 
Use two cups cocoanut, two cups sugar, one-quarter cup 
boiling water. Mix and let stand for two hours. Then 
stiffen, flavor with vanilla and break off small pieces. 
Shape these like fingers and drop in a dish of cinnamon. 
Have some one to roll them in this, as they will be 
smeary if one does it alone. 

To make orange sticks, use the grated rind and juice of 
one orange and add enough XXXX sugar to make it look 
like thick cream. After two hours stiffen and roll same 
as for sweet potatoes and use plain or dipped in choco- 
late. 

Candies should be kept twenty-four hours before dip- 
ping. Use Baker's Chocolate melted in a bowl set in a 
pan of boiling water. When it is liquid, drop the candies 
in and remove at once with a fork or hat pin. place on 
sieve or colander to drain off, then drop on paraffine pa- 
per. When the chocolate becomes stiff, scrape off of col- 
ander and paper also and put back in bowl to melt again. 



63 

Candies made in this way, placed between sheets of 
paraffine paper in a tin box, will keep for months. 

Mrs. A. L. Harris. 
Chocolate Fudge. 
Two pounds sugar, one-quarter pound cake of Baker's 
Chocolate, two tablespoonfuls Baker's Cocoa, butter the 
size of an egg, one cup of milk. Flavor with vanilla or 
cinnamon. Boil five minutes, beat until creamy. 

Edna Wroth. 
Chocolate Fudge. 
Two cups granulated sugar, two-thirds cup milk, one 
ounce butter, two ounces of Baker's Chocolate, one-half 
teaspoon of vanilla. Put sugar and milk over fire until 
the boiling point is reached, add butter and allow to boil 
until the syrup will form a soft ball if tried in cold water. 
Take from fire, add chocolate and vanilla and stir until it 
snaps. Quickly pour into a buttered dish and when part- 
ly cool cut into squares. Naomi Baxter. 

Caramels. 

One cup sugar, one cup cream, three-eighths cup Karo 
syrup, one-quarter cup butter (may be omitted), one-half 
teaspoonful vanilla. Mix sugar, syrup, one-half cream 
and butter and stir till it boils. Add rest of cream with- 
out stopping the boiling. Boil, stirring every few minutes 
until, when tried in cold water, a firm ball will form in 
the fingers. Remove, add vanilla and pour into well-but- 
tered tins. When cool cut in squares and wrap in paraffin 
paper. (White, brown or maple sugar syrup may be used 
in place of Karo Corn Syrup.) Helen L. Comstock. 

Peanut Brittle. 

Place two pounds of granulated sugar in an iron skillet 
over a slow fire and stir constantly until quite dissolved. 
Do not put any liquid with the sugar. It will lump when 
starting to melt and seem quite hopeless, but it will final- 
ly melt and must be stirred to keep from burning. When 
entirely smooth, take from fire and beat in one level tea- 
spoonful of bread soda. It will lighten the brittle. Add 
one teaspoonful of lemon extract and pour the mixture in 
a dish that has been buttered and covered with halves of 
peanuts. It will harden at once. Mrs. R. D. Moore. 



64 

Peanut Candy. 

Two cupfuls sugar, one-half cup water. When it boils 
add one-half teaspoonful of cream of tartar, dissolved in 
a little cold water; cook until brittle, add butter size of 
walnut, cook few minutes. Pour in buttered tins lined 
with nuts. Mrs. J. Howard. 

Divinity Fudge. 

Two and one-half cups sugar, one-half cup water, one- 
half cup Karo corn syrup, whites of two eggs, one cup 
broken walnuts. Mix sugar, syrup and water and boil 
until, when dropped in cold water, mixture will form a 
firm ball between the fingers. Beat the eggs stiff. Pour 
half the boiling mixture over the eggs, beating constantly. 
Return the remaining half of mixture to stove and boil 
until, when dropped in cold water, it forms a hard ball. 
Then remove from the stove and pour slowly into the 
first half, beating constantly. Add walnuts and vanilla, 
pour into a buttered pan and cut in squares. 

Inez Russell.

two teaspoonfuls of vanilla. Cook it until it will harden 
in cold water. Beat for five minutes. Pour into butter 
tins. Bertha Hackett.

butter size of an egg. Cook until hard in water. Take off, 
flavor with vanilla. Beat five minutes. Put nuts in but- 
tered pans, pour candy over them. Alta H. Price. 



65 

Canning. Preserving and Pickling. 



The success of canning depends upon absolute steriliza- 
tion and heating the fruits and vegetables till all the 
germs are destroyed, then scaling it airtight while scald- 
ing hot. 

Canned Peaches. 

Halve, pare and drop in cold water the peaches to In- 
used. Have small kettle of boiling water on stove ready 
to fill jars, drop peaches into another vessel of boiling 
water and let scald, not boil, until tender. Put in jars first 
a layer of peaches, two teaspoons of sugar, then cover 
that with clear boiling water. Continue until the jar is 
full. Water and sugar will form syrup. 

Mrs. Jas. H. Warren. 

Canned Pineapple. 

Shred pineapple with fork. Sweeten as you would if 
serving on table. Let come to a good boil. Fill sterilized 
jars. Seal airtight. Place in pan of boiling water and let 
stand until all is cold. Mrs. Wilmer L. Ford. 

Canned Keifer Pears. 

Cut in small pieces and sugar with sufficient sugar as if 
serving on table. Let stand about two hours. Put on 
stove and let boil ten minutes. Seal in sterilized jars. 
Fine to serve as a dessert with cut up oranges, bananas 
and pineapples. O. H. M. 

Canned Apples. 

Take sweet apples, Fallowater preferred. Pare and cut 
in quarters, smaller, if liked. Make a syrup enough to 
cover apples, not cooking more than two quarts at a time. 
Add apples to boiling syrup and cook slowly until tender. 

A. W. R. 
Canned Asparagus and Peas. 
Have fresh asparagus and pack in a glass jar, fill with 
colli water with one teaspoonful of salt to each quart. 
Put on the rubber and top and boil for one hour on each 



66 

of three successive days. Put boiler on and place a false 
bottom in it. Pour in about three inches of cold water or 
just enough to form steam to prevent the boiler from go- 
ing dry during this boiling. The steam does the cooking. 
Put cover on boiler and set it on the stove ; bring the wa- 
ter to a boil and keep it boiling one hour. At the end of 
that time remove the cover of boiler and allow steam to 
escape. Press down the spring of jars (these must be 
glass top jars), to prevent any outside air from entering. 
The jars can be allowed to cool in boiler until the next 
day. The second day raise the spring at the side of jar; 
this prevents pressure from steam that might accumulate 
inside. Repeat this operation the third day. After the 
sterilization is complete the jars may be set aside for a 
day or two and then tested. This is done by releasing the 
spring at the side and picking up the jar by the top. If 
there has been the least decomposition the top will come 
off. In this case empty out the contents and fill the jars 
with a fresh supply. Other vegetables can be canned by 
this recipe, though some, such as sweet potatoes and 
beets, require parboiling first. 

Mrs. J. Biddle Hossixger, Edith M. Hepburx. 

Canned Corn. 

Cut corn from cob and put on enough salt to season 
well, pack tightly in jars. Set jars in a kettle of boiling 
water with water reaching up to mouth of jar. Boil hard 
one hour for pint jars, two hours for quarts. Take out, 
put rubbers on jars and screw up very tight. Keep in a 
cool, dark place. Mrs. M. R. Hoffecker. 

Canned Tomatoes. 

Select firm, smooth fruit and of a size to slip into the 
ordinary fruit jar. Peel without breaking; do not scald. 
Have ready a preserving kettle of water which has been 
salted enough to taste. Just before the water reaches 
boiling point drop in the tomatoes, just enough to do 
three jars at a time, heat them through thoroughly. Do 
not allow the water to boil. Put fruit in jars with just a 
little of the salt water, as they make enough juice — cover 
quickly. Seal tops of jars with Parowax. 

Mae W. Jewell.

Preserved Strawberries. 
Wash fruit. Add three-quarters pound of sugar to one 
pound of fruit. Let come to a boil slowly; boil five min- 
utes, then strain through a coarse colander and boil syrup 
fifteen to twenty minutes; then add fruit and pour all into 
pint jars, sealing them tightly. Berries preserved in this 
way lose neither their color nor size, and will be as fine a 
year hence as when first put up. L. A. Money. 

Preserved Strawberries (In the Sun). 

Let three pounds of sugar and one-half tumbler of wa- 
ter come to a boil; stir to keep from burning. Then put 
in three pounds of berries and boil fifteen minutes, shake 
but do not stir. Take the berries out of the syrup. Let 
(he syrup boil five minutes longer, then put the berries in 
the syrup again until they become thoroughly heated. 
Pour both berries and syrup into three large dishes and 
set in the sun three days. Put in jars without heating 
again. Mrs, Edward W. Ford. 

Sun Preserves. 

One pound fruit, one pound sugar. Let fruits to be pre- 
served in sun stand awhile to make their own juice. It is 
better not to do over three pounds at a time. Sugar 
strawberries over night : peaches, if sliced, less time, and 
cherries two hours. When fruit is to stand only a short 
time use only part of the sugar in sugaring down, jusl 
enough to dissolve, adding the rest when juice is put on 
stove. Boil juice fifteen minutes, add fruit, and let come 
to a good boil. Remove from stove, place in shallow 
dishes, cover with glass, put in sun (on a south roof, if 
possible) and let cook for several days or until syrup is 
thick. Put in glasses, cover well with paraffin and put on 

top. ( )LLIE I 1 AKI'l.i; M EDDERS. 

Red Cherries, Preserved in Sun. 

Take nice ripe cherries, wash and seed t hem. Take 
three-quarters pound of sugar to a pound of cherries. Let 
come to a boil. Pour in shallow dishes and set in sun 
from two to three days, according to the sun. Put in jars 
and seal while cold. Helen Ford. 



68 

Grape Conserve. 

Five pounds grapes, three oranges, one-half pound cur- 
rants, four pounds sugar, one pound seeded raisins, small 
quantity of citron. Separate the pulp from the skin and 
remove seeds. Add the pulp and skin of grapes, pulp of 
oranges, sugar and other ingredients. Let set over night. 
Then cook until quite thick. Mrs. Mary Clark. 

Preserved Green Tomatoes. 

Five pounds green tomatoes the size of a walnut. Wash, 
cut out the core, prick with fork four times. Let stand 
over night. In morning make a syrup with five pounds 
sugar. When syrup is real thick, drop in the tomatoes. 
Let cook slowly about two hours. Flavor with one thin 
slice of lemon. Put in glass jars and seal tight. 

Mrs. J. L. Price. 

Preserved Gooseberries. 

Use half grown berries. One and one-quarter pounds 
sugar, two tablespoons of water to moisten sugar. Boil 
syrup five minutes. Pour one pound of berries in syrup 
and boil twenty minutes. Pour in jelly glasses as you 
would jelly. Mrs. John H. Clexdaxiel. 

Jelly. 

When making jelly care must be taken that fruit is not 
too ripe. If ripe fruit must be used, something else will 
have to be added to supply the needed pectin — one-third 
of the quantity in very green green apples will do this. 
Whatever is used must be cooked and strained with the 
other fruit. Mash slightly or cut in small pieces all fruits 
to be used, putting them on stove with only just enough

CURING OF MEAT. 



No. I. 

After the animal heat is out of the meat take hams and 
shoulders, rub fine salt over them and put them in a hogs- 
head, placing the hocks, similarly treated, in the small 
spaces. Pack as close as possible to take less pickle. 
•Make a' pickle of one pound of saltpeter, two gallons dark 
sweet molasses and ground alum, salt sufficient to bear an 
egg. Pour pickle in hogshead and if that is not sufficient 
to cover meat make enough pickle of water and ground 
alum salt to bear an egg that will fully cover meat. Leave 
meat in pickle for six weeks or more. When taken out of 
pickle hang up until dry, then smoke for day or more with 
chips or cobs. Then bag in paper or cotton bags lined 
with paper, or if not wishing to bag them, sprinkle with 
powdered borax. 

Dry salt the middlings, placing one on top of another 
with plenty of ground alum salt to stay six weeks. Hang 
up, smoke and sprinkle with borax. Harry Davis. 

No. 2. 

Two hundred pounds ham, twelve pounds brown sugar, 
one-quarter pound ground saltpeter, one-quarter pound 
black pepper; about twenty-five pounds of salt. Thor- 
oughly mix these ingredients on a table. Place the ham 
on the pile of mixture, skin downwards. Rub the flesh 
side well, and stuff hock end full of mixture, some of 
which sprinkle on bottom of barrel. Place a layer of 
hams in barrel, skin down, covering top surface liberally 
with mixture. Continue thus with the hams, each having 
been treated in the same way until the supply is exhaust- 
ed. Then comes the shoulders treated in like manner, 
followed by middlings and chines so treated. They make 
their own brine, of which the hams, at the bottom, get the 
full benefit. Leave in brine for about one month when 
hang up and smoke for a few days. Sprinkle a little borax 



75 

on meat, if desired, when taken out of brine. While this 
militates against the sale of the meat, being against the 
pure food law, it insures against the skipper fly. These 
hams are not used until a year old. S. S. Hepburn. 

No. 3. 

Eighty pounds of meat, one quart fine salt crushed to 
powder, two ounces saltpeter, four ounces brown sugar. 
Mix well and apply to meat, rubbing flesh side thoroughly, 
being liberal with amount rubbed around bones and in 
hock end of hams and shoulders. Lay each piece skin 
down, being careful not to let them touch. After twenty- 
four hours apply one quart fine salt to same quantity of 
meat. Place again as before without letting the pieces 
touch and let stand two, maybe three, months, when hang. 
(If not cooked for six months after cured the flavor will 
be fine.) Mrs. W. D. Pennington. 

No. 4. 

To one hundred pounds meat take two pounds brown 
sugar, one-quarter pound saltpeter, one-quarter pound 
black pepper, one-eighth pound red pepper, two quarts 
salt, one tablespoon cloves. Mix ingredients together and 
rub well into the meat. Lay out separately for six weeks, 
then hang up and smoke. Albert Jervis. 

Sausage, No. 1. 

Cut meat in strips and mix well with seasoning before

76 

Hogshead Cheese.

hog's head. If salt, soak twenty-four hours; put on to 
boil, and cover with water, boil until tender, drain, pick 
out the bones, grind, season to taste with salt, pepper, 
sage, a little vinegar and mustard. Pack in a crock or 
pan to cool; when cold, turn out and serve sliced thin. 

Mrs. Emma Jarrell. 

Scrapple. 

Boil sweet bones, hearts and scraps of meat until very 
tender. Cool, separate bones from meat with the hands. 
Grind hearts, add one-fourth quantity of nice skins. Boil 
until very tender, throw away water. Grind skins and 
cook with water bones were boiled in. Season with sage, 
salt and pepper. Sift together three pints of meal, one of 
flour. Sprinkle meal and flour with left hand; stir with 
right. Cook all five minutes or until batter is of the con- 
sistency of pound cake batter. Pour in pans to cool.

CANDY. 

Washington's Favorite — One pound XXXX sugar, one- 
quarter pound of butter and one tablespoonful of cream. 
Mix together and then work well as you would make but- 
ter. Flavor and color as you desire. Mixed with chopped 
nuts or fruit this makes delicious Easter eggs. Form into 
eggs, using a large tablespoon to shape. Lay the egg aside 
to dry. Then place one-half pound of chocolate, two table- 
spoonfuls of butter and a piece of parafine the size of an 
almond in a double boiler and heat slowly. Now dip the 
egg and lay on a wax paper to dry. To ornament the 



85 

egg, place in a bowl one-half cup of sifted XXXX sugar 
and add two tablespoonfuls of cornstarch, one teaspoon- 
ful of lemon juice and one teaspoonful of vanilla extract 
and sufficient boiling water to make the mixture spread 
without running. Beat for five minutes to blend and then 
cover closely. Make a cornucopia of heavy wax paper, 
fill with this icing, and using this, borders, names and de- 
signs may be made. Mrs. Harvey B. Moore. 

Cocoa Fudge — Two cups sugar, one tablespoon butter, 
four tablespoons cocoa, two-thirds cup milk. Boil 15 min- 
utes. Edna Hackett. 

Candied Grape Fruit or Orange Peel — Take grape fruit 
or orange rinds, cut in thin strips, put on in cold water 
three times and let come to a boil. To three grape fruit 
rinds or four orange rinds, melt two cups sugar (well 
moistened) in saucepan. Drop in fruit. Cook till clear. 
Lift with fork and roll in granulated sugar. M. M. 

Strawberry and Rhubarb Jam — Use equal parts rhu- 
barb and strawberries. To each cup of the mixture, use 
three-quarters cup of sugar. The rhubarb should be cut 
into one-half inch length, and the berries crushed. Bring 
slowly to boil and cook 30 minutes, add sugar and cook 
until of desired consistency. Seal in sterilized jars. To 
avoid danger of mold, process jars for 25 minutes in water 
bath. O. H. M. 

Apple Butter — To five gallons of cut apples, take five 
pounds sugar and one quart of vinegar. Put the apples 
over the fire with enough water to cook down, add the 
sugar and stir well, then add the vinegar with ground all- 
spice to flavor. Continue to boil and stir until done. I do 
not use but one pint of vinegar and very little allspice 
and some cinnamon. 

Mrs. E. M. Bonwill, Jr. 

Apple-Ginger Marmalade — Four pounds apples, four 
pounds sugar, one pint water, one ounce green ginger, 
grated rind of four lemons. Dissolve the sugar in the wa- 
ter; chop the apples and ginger fine, add to syrup with 
the lemon rind, and simmer slowly until it looks clear, 
about four hours. Pour into sterilized glasses and seal as 
usual. L. E. Busick.

Pear-Ginger Marmalade — Pare and cut in small pieces, 
two pounds pears, add two pounds sugar, one teaspoon of 
ginger. Put through chopper juice and pulp of one lemon, 
grated rind and juice of one orange. Cook and put in 
jars. Seal while hot. Mrs. P. A. M. Brooks. 

Grape Conserve, No. 2 — Proceed as you would for grape 
jelly, only using the juice from the pulps. Have ready 
two pounds nut meats, chopped fine, two pounds raisins, 
and a little orange peel. This is the amount for about 12 
cups of juice. Boil the juice five minutes then add equal 
amount of sugar. After this begins to boil hard, add the 
fruits and nuts and boil hard until it jells, about 20 min- 
utes altogether. Mrs. Walter B. Harris. 

Green Tomato Mincemeat — One peck green tomatoes, 
one-quarter peck apples, three packages of seeded raisins, 
four pounds brown sugar, one-half pound suet chopped 
fine, one pint vinegar, one quart water, two teaspoons 
ground cinnamon, one and one-half teaspoons ground 
cloves, two teaspons ground nutmeg, one teaspoon salt. 
Put tomatoes through food chopper, drain as much of 
green water off as you can, cover with cold water, let 
come to boil second time. Drain well, mix altogether, 
cook until thick. Put in jars while hot. Use large knife 
in food chopper for grinding. Mrs. Evelyn Nelson. 

Canned Soup Mixture — The following combination of 
vegetables makes a fine soup with good stock and diced 
white potatoes: Use about one-half the quantity desired 
canned in tomatoes. Other vegetables (cut fine), cab- 
bage, carrots, onions, peppers (both sweet and hot), corn, 
celery leaves and parsley. Let tomatoes come to a boil, 
then add corn, celery and parsley and boil about 15 min- 
utes. Other vegetables, particularly cabbage, carrots and 
onions should cook a little longer. Do not use any more 
water than absolutely necessary in the cooking, substi- 
tuting tomato juice instead. After all are cooked as 
stated, mix together, fill well sterilized jars, one and one- 
half to two teaspoons of salt to each quart. Process two 
and one-half hours. O. H. M.

FEEDING THE CHILD. 



Are You Feeding Your Family Intelligently? 



An infant deprived of mother's milk, to which the par- 
tially developed digestive system is adapted, must be fed 
with the greatest care and intelligence. There is nothing 
"just as good" as mother's milk. 

But since many children have to be weaned or partially 
weaned even in the early months of the first year, the 
mother must know what to feed and how to feed her 
baby. 

Cow's Milk the Best Substitute for Mother's Milk at 
Our Disposal. — Cow's milk to be safe for the baby, must 
be clean and free from adulterants, must be free of dis- 
ease germs, must be relatively fresh (under 36 hours), 
must be kept cold after production. 

If the cow whose milk you feed your baby is not kept 
on your own premises, get certified milk or the best 
grade of pasteurized bottled milk. Otherwise always 
scald milk before using it for the baby. Where fresh milk 
cannot be obtained, milk powder (dry milk) is the best 
form of canned milk for infant use. (The Dry or Brand 
Milk Powder obtained from the Dry Milk Co., 19-27 Park 
Row, New York City, is highly recommended.) 

General Character of the Diet — Food must contain 
plenty of the right sort of material to build up and re- 
pair the living tissues of the body; enough material to 
use as fuel to furnish energy for heat and work, an 
abundance of mineral material and the little known sub- 
stances which regulate body health and growth. 

Children, like all young animals, require more growth 
or body-building material relative to their size than they 
do when fully grown. 



89 

Do you know which foods are necessary for growth? 

For the best growth and development, a child's food 
must contain : First. Animal protein, found especially in 
milk, eggs, meat, including fish and fowl. The protein of 
certain vegetables and nuts contains body-building sub- 
stances and will do to help out the animal protein, but 
will not suffice alone, for the best growth and develop- 
ment of the average child. Second. Mineral matter, needed 
in the growth and functioning of the parts of the body, 
such as the skelton, the blood, the hair, etc. The chief 
sources of these minerals arc milk, eggs, meat, green 
vegetables and fruits. Third. The substances regulating 
growth, found especially in the fat of milk, eggs, leaf 
vegetables, but not found in vegetable oils or pork fat. 



Whole milk contains an abundance of animal protein, minerals, and 
the growth-regulating substances, besides fat and sugar. No other food- 
stuff is therefore so important in infancy and childhood. 

Indispensable Articles of Food in Childhood. — 1. Whole 
milk, or skim milk with butter. 2. Butter. 3. Green 
vegetables, especially leaf vegetables. 4. Starchy foods, 
which are the principal sources of energy but are not 
growth foods. To these four essentials it is desirable to 
add. Some eggs or meat, including fish or fowl, sugar, 
fruits. 



Choose easily digested food for the child and see that it is properly 
cooked. 

Meals for the Well Child. — By the end of the first year, 
a child should have four meals a day. By the end of the 
second year three meals a day are sufficient for the aver- 
age child. 

Plenty at Meal Time and Nothing Between Meals. — A 

baby at one year may take a quart of milk a day. After 
this age, as he takes more cereal and bread with egg and 
vegetables, reduce the milk to three cups a day. A child 
will take more food if he drinks most of the milk at the 
end instead of at the beginning of the meal. 

Cereals, bread, potato, and rice are the starchy foods 
the fuel foods — and should be part of every meal. Cooked 



90 

cereals are best for children. Victory bread, thoroughly 
dried in the oven, can be used from infancy on. The child 
needs an -abundance of fuel food as well as growth food. 
Green vegetables — spinach, chard, beet greens, beets, 
carrots, onions, string beans, celery, asparagus, — should 
appear in the diet by the end of the first year. These 
vegetables should be first used in strained soup or broth, 
then as purees, and by the end of the second year 
mashed or finely divided. Peas, beans (other than string 
beans), and corn should not be given to very young chil- 
dren except as purees. Cauliflower and cabbage may be 
given to older children. 

Children crave sweets, and they should be given these, 
especially in the noon dessert, as simple puddings, cus- 
tards, home-made ice cream, fruit, jellies or simple candy. 



Sweets between meals mean bad teeth and bad "tummies." 
Fruits should appear daily in the diet of the child; fruit 
juices for the baby, stewed apples, or prune pulp later in 
infancy. Raw apple (at first scraped), oranges, ripe 
peaches, and any cooked fruit may be given to the older 
child. Bananas are not fit food for a child to eat unless 
the skin is brown or the banana is cooked. 

The Right Sort of Food at the Right Time. — A young 
child should have the principal meal at noon, including a 
vegetable and meat soup, or an egg, or meat (including 
fish and fowl), with a green vegetable, and starchy vege- 
table or cereal. Cereal and milk with cooked fruit make 
the best supper and breakfast. 

Preach the full dinner plate for children and then the 
clean dinner plate.

SICK DIET. 

Beef Tea. 

Free a pound of lean beef from fat, skin, etc. Chop up 
fine. Put in a pint of cold water to digest two hours. 
Simmer for three hours, but do not let boil. Make up for 
water lost by adding cold water. Press and strain. The 
best meats for beef tea arc the round and rump. Cold 
water draws out the albumin ; boiling water coagulates it. 
Beef Juice. 

Cut thin, juicy meat into pieces one and one-half inches 
square; broil one and one-half minutes over a hot fire. 
Squeeze with a hot lemon squeezer; season with salt and 
pepper. May be added to milk or poured over toast. 
Oatmeal Gruel. 

Two tablespoonfuls of rolled oats, teaspoonful of salt, 

teaspoonful of sugar, and one cup of boiling milk. Mix 

oatmeal, sugar, and salt; add boiling water; cook in a 

saucepan thirty minutes, or in a double boiler for two 

hours. Strain and add hot milk. Bring to a boil and 

serve hot. 

Oyster Broth. 

Chop a dozen oysters fine; put into a saucepan with a 
cup of cold water. Bring to boiling point; simmer five 
minutes, then strain and season. By adding milk three 
minutes before broth is taken from the fire it is made 
more palatable. 

Poached Egg. 
Pour hot water (or milk) into a saucepan, using salt, 
spoonful of salt to each cup of water. Bring to boiling 
point. Break egg into a saucer and slip into the pan. 
Withdraw the pan to a cooler part of the stove and cook 
till white of egg is set. 

Soft Boiled and Hard Boiled Eggs (See Eggs). 

Stewed Prunes. 

Wash thoroughly, cover with cold water over night. In 

the morning put on back of the stove and let cook very 

slowly about two hours. If choice prunes are used no 

sugar will be needed. 

Cup Custard (See Desserts).

I n Emergen ci es. 



First Send for the Doctor! Phone No 

Then try to remove the poison from the stomach. This 
can usually be accomplished by tickling the back of the 
throat with the end of the finger or a feather, or by ad- 
ministering of emetics. 



EMETICS. 

Alum — One tablespoon dissolved in cup of tepid water. 
Ipecac — Two tablespoonfuls of syrup of ipecac. 
Mustard — One tablespoonful mixed in half-pint water. 
Salt — Two tablespoonfuls in half-pint water. 



ANTIDOTES FOR POISON. 
Carbolic Acid 

Empty the stomach and give olive oil, one-half cup in 
one pint of water, or give milk or white of egg in water. 

Oxalic Acid — Sulphuric Acid (Oil of Vitriol) 

Do not give emetics for any of these three poisons. Give 
whiting, chalk, plaster scraped from the walls, washing 
soda, or soap and water. Follow with milk and eggs, 
olive oil, or thick gruel. 

Prussic Acid 

Give an emetic at once. When stomach is emptied fol- 
low with milk or olive oil or white of egg. 

Tartar Emetic 

Give large quantities of warm water to provoke vomit- 
ing. Give strong tea. When vomiting ceases give white 
of egg in milk or water. 



93 

ANTIDOTES FOR POISON- Continued. 



Corrosive Sublimate (Bichlorid of Mercury) 

Give large quantities of milk before giving emetics. 
Then empty the stomach thoroughly. 

Illuminating Gas 

Get patient into fresh, pure air. Open all windows. 

Ammonia — Caustic Potash — Caustic Soda 
Do not give emetics. Give vinegar in water or lemon 
juice. Follow with olive oil, quarter-pint in pint of wa- 
ter, or white of egg. 

Arsenic (Fowler's Solution, Rough on Rats, Paris Green) 

Prompt emetic should be given. If there be any medi- 
cine at hand containing iron, this can be given. Follow 
with milk and eggs, olive oil, or barley water. 

Toadstools — Tobacco 

Produce vomiting. Follow with strong coffee or brandy. 

Ptomaine Poisoning 

dive an emetic. Purge with castor oil. Strong coffee. 

Opium — Laudanum — Morphine — Paregoric — "Soothing 
Syrup" 

Keep patient warm and awake until arrival of doctor. 
Under no circumstances must he be allowed to relax 
into a stupor. Shout at him, slap his chest with wet 
towels, walk him about with support each side. 



94 



SALT HINTS. 



Salt in water or other fluid retards the boiling. 

Salt, mixed with soda, is a remedy for bee stings. 

Salt and water make an excellent throat gargle. 

Salt in whitewash will make it stick. 

Salt and hot water will thaw a frozen drainpipe. 

Salt will remove tea stains from delicate china cups. 

Salt added to snow makes the mixture much colder. 

Salt thrown on a fire will extinguish a burning chimney. 

Salt and warm water is an emetic in case of poisoning. 

Salt sprinkled on a range absorbs grease splutterings. 

Salt, warmed and rubbed on a soiled light coat, will 
clean it. 

Salt added to last water keeps clothes from freezing. 

Salt will clean a discolored bath tub or enameled ware. 

Salt placed first in the frying pan prevents grease from 
spluttering. 

Salt will remove perspiration stains from your clothes. 
Soak the garments in strong salt water before laundering. 

Salt and water will clean willow furniture. Apply it 
with a stiff brush, scrub well and air thoroughly. 

Salt put in pan in bottom of oven under baking tins is 
said to prevent bread and cake from scorching on bottom.

THE AFTER WORD. 



The work which is represented by the pages that 
have preceded this one, has seemed at times to the 
members of the Committees in charge of it, to be 
almost stupendous. It is certain that some cf them 
will look with different eyes hereafter on all books. 
Certainly there will be a clearer appreciation of some 
of the ingredients that are put into the publicalion of 
a book. Whatever may be the things that go into the 
preparation of other books, besides the very exacting 
mechanical labor, there has gone into this, certainly, 
much love and hope. 

It is natural that the Epworth League should 
love this child of theirs. It is the product of sacrifice 
and prayer. To those to whom it comes a welcome is 
begged and indulgence for its faults is prayed. It 
goes forth sped with high hopes for a long continued 
usefulness. May it be a constant source of aid and 
delight. Therefore we subscribe ourselves:
