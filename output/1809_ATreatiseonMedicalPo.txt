There is nothing new in asserting^ that 
marshy situations, and collections of stag«- 
nant water^ form sources of disease. Every 
person is aware of this fact^ and every body 
talks about it ; but it seems never to have 
been considered with a view to their remov- 
al, which is the only point of view in which 
it ought to be considered, if we expect that 
mankind are to be benefited by our exer* 
tions. 

VOL. II. A 



When we reflect that putrefying 'vegeta- 
ble matter, for instance, is highly destruc- 
tive of human life, a fact which has been 
acknowledged in every age,- though the real 
nature of it seems npt to have been under- 
stood; and when we reflect that all are 
nearly equally expo$^4 tq its baneful influ- 
ence, we must perceive that the removal or 
suppression of such nuisances, equally in- 
terest every description of individuals. 

In whatever form these putrefying masses 
may exist, even although they may be pla- 
ced at a considerable distance from the ha- 
bitations of man, they ought, by universal 
consent, to be entirely removed^i 

This subject has hot escaped that very 
great observer of nature. Lord Bacon, who 
says, that " the inducing or accelerating 
putrefaction is a subject ^.f y§Ty universal 
inquiry, and that it is of excellent use to in- 
qjuire into the means of g^reventijig or stay- 
ing it, which maJ^e^ a gre^t pert of physic 
^nd surgery." 

The various modics of improyi»g land in 
diflferent parts of the world have greaJtly 
contributed to the removal and pneventioo 
of diseases evidently occasioned by & neglect 
of these matters. For instance, so iar back 
as the days of Empecloclcs, that philoso- 
pher, by shutting up a great gulph of the 



^ -. • 



earthy Dpened in a valley betwieen two 
mountains^ freed all Sicily from a plague 
arising ihenjce. Other instances may be ad- 
duced of the great benefit which has been 
deriyed from the improvements which have 
been made under similar circumstances. 
It is well kno\}^n, that several of the West 
India islands are much more healthy than 
others^ and this has been justly attributed^ 
partly to the height of their grounds^ biit 
more particularly to the ^ate of improve- 
ment in respect to clearing the ground of 
ttees^ shrubs^ and marshes, by which the air 
has been rendered perfectly salutary. 

To prevent the stagnation of noxious va- 
pours in low grounds, in any country, it has 
been proposed, that trees ought never to be 
planted upon them, but upon the higher 
grounds, where grain cannot grow, and 
which are equally useful in rearing wood 
as those places wjiich ought entirely to be 
net aside for the production of grain. A 
Jate author, Mr Williams, . is of opinion^ 
that the practice of planting trees in high 
situations would assist in attracting moisture^ 
ai^d thereby render the neighbouring coun- 
try wet, and^this thought certainly deserves 
r iconsideration be&re such measures ate 
adopted.

When putrid vapours have actually been 
collected, and when they are only collected 
within a circumscribed space, fires have 
been recommended, as occasioning currents 
of air which may carry off and disperse 
them ; but I believe this is the utmost be- 
i^efit that can be expected from the use of 
fires, as there is scarcely an instance, even 
when carried to combustion, where fires 
have had any effect in decomposing the pu- 
trid efHuvia, Dr Mead denies that they 
possess any power in lessening the violence 
' of the plague ; hut, in many instances, by 
giving additional heat to the already too 
much heated atmosphere, they have done 
harm. 

There are certain situations where, from 
local circumstances, the soil cannot well 
undergo any change for the better. Vari- 
ous instances . of this sort are well known, 
which, to answer the purposes intended, 
would require that the process of conti- 
nually draining, &c. should be adopted 
in them, as their local situation renders 
this necessary. 

When such rare occurrences happen, it 
is only necessary to avoid as much as pos»- 
ble breathing the effluvia arising from such|M| 
soil.

It is remarkable^ that both the rock and 
eoil of Gibraltar are of a calcareous nature^ 
and it is famed for its healthfulness. £as- 
ton, Narareth, and Bethlehem^ ddd/ m 
the c6unly of Northampton, Aiiierica, are' 
built of lime-stone, and these, partibdlarly; 
the latter, are very healthful. Febrile dis^ 
tempers very rardy occur in them. 

Particular parts, therefore, of ct^ry coutt-' 
try, deprived of this substan^, ought to 
have it introduced into it. This has been 
adopted in America. 

Calcareous materials in general have ih*^ 
deed been found of the greatest service, it) 
various parts of the wofld, when used in 

« 

building, paving, &c. in suppressing conta<* 
gious distempers. 

The city of Lisbon, for instance, is built 
of these materials, and though the tnbst nas- 
ty, is the most healthy place in Eui-ope. 
The chalky soil of Oxfordshire, also^ par- 
ticularly around its university, renders it re- 
markably healthful. A great deal of these 
materials exist in the Bermudas likewise, and 
that place is prov^rbisd for its salubrity.

sorbing a great proportion of any kind of 
air to which I exposed it. It is the epUo- 
bium hirsutum of Linnseus, in English the 
wUiow plant, and it grows best in the water 
of marshy ground." This is a valuable fact, 
as air, which from certain local circum- 
stances, or other causes, cannot admit of 
the vitiating principle being completely re- 
moved, may be greatly amended by planting 
upon or in the neighbourhood of such pla- 
ces, a quantity of these trees proporiioned 
to the quantity of vitiated air which may be 
produced. 

Upon the whole, that part of any country 
in which we wish to choose a residence, 
ought as much as possible to be temperate, 
pure and dry, which has a very beneficial 
effect upon the respiratory organs, and 
strengthens and braces the fibres : cold and 
dry air is tolerable, but damp air is very 
dangerous; it particularly increases the dis- 
orders incident to men of letters, relaxes, 
. obstructs perspiration, and produces catarrhs, 
rheumatisms, and palsies. 

To remove from a cold temperature to 
one still colder, is not nearly so prejudicial 
as exchanging the air of a warm room for 
that of a moist and cold atmosphere. It is 
upon this principle that we are so apt to be 
affected by colds about the cool days of au- 
tumn after the heat of summer.

We ought to make choice of a pure mr; 
free from kll pk^llation, and far remote froar 
stinking places, for such air is most fit to pre^ 
serve life^ and >to recreate the spirits;- 
whereas, on the contrary, a cloudy or misty 
air, and( such as is infected with gross and 
stinking vapours, dulls the spirits, destroys 
the appetite, and is the cause of many dis* 
eases« 

In listening to the advice of the poet» on 
this occasion, we shall not only attend to 
our own comfort, but to our benefit.

and, above all, they should avoid living near 

places which emit any sort of unwholesome

particular, because they are, from the nature 
of their pursuits^ deprived of inany advan- 
tages which zrb comtifton to almost evefy

m^y be observed, that such situations as are 
beneficial to men of letters, cartnot be other- 
lyise than useful to every other class in so-

lies cannot afreet them, at least in a perpen- 
dicular ascent, and where the habitable parts 
of the houses themselves are not in any 
part under ground. Experience fully con- 
firms this truth, that in situations where the 
soil is^dry and gravelly, and clear from woods 
or stagnating water, people, even in the 
very hottest climates enjoy good health du- 
ring all the seasons of the year.

POLICE FOB ABTIFICIAL CAUSES. 



Sect. h-^PoUce for Construction of Houses. 

It is universally acknowledged, that the 
air of a pity is much inftrior in purity, td 
the air in a free and open country. Peo- 
ple of all descriptions, but especially such 
as are weak and emaciated, derive a consi- 
derable degree of exhilaration and improve* 
ment from a short excursion from town ; 
and, if much confined to the house, expo** 
sure even to the city air is sensibly invigorat- 
ing. But, 

•^ Ye who iTOid this feverish world would wear 
A body free of pain, of cares a mind ; 
Fly the rank city, shun its turbid air ; 
Breathe not the chaos of eternal smoke 
And volatile corruption, from ttie dead. 
The dying, sickening, and the living world 
Exhal'd to sully heaven's transparent dome 
With dim mortality. It is not air 
That from a thousand luogs reeks back to thine. 



18 



Sated with exhalations rank and fell^ 

The spoil of dunghills^ and ]the putrid thaw 

Of nature, when from shape and texture she 

Relapses into fighting elements : 

It is not air, but floats a nauseous mass 

Of all obscene, corrupt, offensive things. 

Much moisture hurts ; but here a sordid bath. 

With oily rancouf fraught, relaxes more 

The solid frame than simple moisture can/' 

It IS only during the uninterrupted flow of 
health that we can enjoy comfort or plea- 
sure of any description ; and as a great pro- 
portion of diseases are propagated by inat- 
tention to the construction of houses, laws 
and regulations for this purpose would con- 
tribute in no small degree to their prevention^ 

The first care, therefore, in building 
cities, is to make them airy and well per- 
flated; because infectious distempers must 
necessarily be propagated amongst mankind 
living too close together. The air is also 
extremely tainted by having burial-places 
within the precincts of great cities. The 
passages, lanes, and streets of cities al^o 
should all be well paved or flagged, and care- 
fully drained, 

Mr Howard's observations on the con- 
struction and alteration of houses, for the 
alleviation of huipan inisery, did equal ho- 
nour to his head and his heart. Although 
liowever, his ind^aligable laboufs occasion- 



J9 



cd many alterations for the relief of thje 
ynfori«jiTOte md the miserable, partly in 
con.seq\3'mcQ of the iu^mediate want of 
gueh iamendmeptfl, end partly by his points 
ing Oiit the evident advantage which were 
experienced in the prisons on the con^ 
iinent, compared with what we could boast 
of in ours; yet his hints have not been 
so much attended to as their importaace re*f 
quired. Hi^s observations indeed were prin«- 
cipally coacern ing, prisons ; but what is ber 
oeficiftl to health in such situations, mav he 
easily appli^ to the lower kinda of habi<»> 
tationa in genjeraL 

. Injst/ead, however, of thus (Extending his 
plans, many of them have been entirely 
overlooked, even in the places to which he 
applied them. Acts of Parliament, unless 
attended to, might as well have never been 
passed, and I am sorry to say this observa^ 
tion may be too easily applied ta our present 
subject. Mr Howard strongly recommends 
as sin external 34va.ntage, that all prisons 
shall be furnished with a court ; but in some 
instances, this is kiipracticable^ * Iti such 
plans, theire is still an advantage, Wtiieh may- 
be productive of much benefit, and which, 
I believe is not used in afiy prison. What 
I allude to, is 4 walk on the top of the hoase 
sufficiently surfouoded l^y high iron railings 
to prevent the escape of the prisoners. 



10 



upon this they may be safely permitted to 
walk a certain number of hours every day. 
In such a place too, the bedding and cloth- 
ing of every sort may be properly aired. Al* 
though these unfortunate people may be 
prisoners, - their health ought most carefully 
to be preserved. In the construction of 
such a plan, however, it might be impro- 
per to make it of lead, which in summer 
would render the house too hot. Even 
when insuperable objections exist in some 
prisons, such a convenience as the above 
would obviate a number of them, by allowr 
ing the inhabitants the partial use of that 
air, which by their unfortunate situation 
they are otherwise denied. 

The inhabitants of every building should 
be proportioned in number to the size and 
conveniences of the building itself ; for when 
this is not observed, however favourable the 
construction of the houses may be, its ten- 
ants cannot be healthy. All ground floors 
of houses that have any signs of moisture 
should be rejected, and if they have been 
long uninhabited, strict attention should be 
paid to these and to every other circum- 
stance by which the air within them may be 
vitiated before they are possessed. No clear- 
er proof can exist of the comparatively salu- 
tary effects of the upper compared with the 



21 



under floors of such houses than every day 
present themselves to us. For it is in eve- * 
ry country observed, that where dampness 
exists in a house, the under floor is always 
the most unhealthy ; and, if possible, to en- 
crease these evils, the custom of papering 
the walls, and thereby harbouring the noxi- 
ous effluvia, with the putrefying swarms of 
vermin which are generated and die under 
it, is the most effectual means. 

But if dry habitations cannot be procured, 
the only resource against sickness from 
moisture, will be an encrease of fuel ; and, 
in addition to that, the floors may be cover- 
ed with oil- cloths, which will intercept much 
of the rising vapour. 

The use of stoves in dwelling houses 
ought universally to be prohibited. The air 
in such apartments becomes heavy and op- 
pressive when deprived of that circulation, 
which is much assisted by the presence of 
an open fire, and which is completely pre- 
vented where there are stoves. Thus the 
heaviness uniformly felt where stoves are 
used, and which is commonly attributed on- 
ly to the want of the presence of the fires, 
arises from causes of a more dangerous 
nature. It is in consequence of the air 
becoming vitiated, and emanations from 
fsome kinds of sheet- iron when heated, in- 



22 



creases the evil ; and, I have nadoubU are in 
many instances causey of disease o£ a very 
serious nature. 

Dr Priestly*s directions for the fori^ation. 
of dining-rooms seepis very judicious, " I 
*' would adyisjB," says he, *^ that when lafge. 
dining-rooms are built, provision be made: 
for letting out tbe vitiated air at thp top of 
them. For, breathing such Qon.ta^^ijiated^ 
air so long a time as it is now the custoni 
to do at and after dinner, must be very hurt- 
ful. Otherwise, if it were not inconvenient 
on other accounts, it would ht brtter to. 
have the dinner in one room, a^ijid ^he dcr 
sert in another.*' 
With regard to hospitals, I may observe, 
that we erect them for the cure of diseases, 
in a great measure, because Wje have neglec- 
ted their prevention. Indeed, I am convuir 
ced, that a vigilant exercise of all the means 
of preventing disease, by the entire removal 
of those sources, of them, which every where 
appear, might, in a short period, supersede 
the use of hospitals, by extinguishing the 
diseases themselves. " This is a prospect,** 
says Dr Currie, *^ in which the philanthro- 
pist might indulge with more safety, if he 
could calculate with equal confidence on the 
wisdom, as on the power of his^ species.

Since^ however, this desired period has 
not yet arrived, our object must be to con-* 
struct hospitals, or set apart houses already 
constructed, which may in every respect 
seem best calculated for the comfort and 
the recovery of the sick. In many instan- 
cesi^ particularly in can>paign8 in difFerent 
parrto of the world, the great advantages de* 
rived from attention to those particulars in 
preventing the extension of disease, and 
thereby saving many thousands who would, 
under these circumstances, have died, are 
very numerous. 

" For this reason,'* says Sir J. Pringle, 
^^ not only barns, stables, granaries, and 
other out- houses, but above all, churches, 
make the best hospitals^ from the beginning 
of June till October. Of this there was an 
instance in the campaign of \1A1y when a 
lai^ge church at Maestrecht was applied to 
that use, and where, notwithstanding above 
an hundred ky in it with foul sores, fluxes, 
wd other putrid diseases, for months toge* 
ther, (during the greatest part of which tim^ 
the weather was very hot) there was no ap- 
pearance of tbift fever (putrid.) Wherefore! 
we may lay it down as a rule, that the more 
fiwb the air we let into hospitals, the less 
danger th^re is of breeding this distemper.'* 



24 



In additidn to the particular construction 
of hospitals (rules applicable to which are 
likewise strictly proper to whatever houses 
sick persons may be confined in) it would 
be a good regulation, especially in such pla« 
ces as may be in any degree crowded, that 
all the patients who are capable of being 
any length of time out of bed, should remain 
through the day in large airy halls, and that 
their wards and bedding should, in the mean- 
time, be as much as possible exposed to 
ventilation. 

In hospitals, it has been recommended to 
employ flock, or, in preference to it, horse- 
hair for stuffing the beds, because it is sup- 
posed that these substances imbibe less of the 
contagious effluvia than wool, while they are 
less liable to become lumpy and uneasy. 
They are likewise preferable to straw, which 
Mr Howard has recommended, because, in- 
dependently of the greatest care in making 
these beds, the pointed spicula of the 
straw will penetrate the cloth inclosing 
them, and prove very injurious to the tender 
skin of those patients who are afflicted with 
diseases of long duration. Straw beds have 
the appearance of less expence, but the fre* 
quency with which they reqmre to be re* 
newed, destroys this only advantage which 
at first recommends them. 



25 



After the numerous proofs that have been 
adduced by authors, that attention to ciean- 
.liness of the persons, and apartments of the 
sick, cpmpletely prevents the spreading of 
contagion, it may be unnecessary to adduce 
any individual instance ; yet I cannot avoid 
mentionihg as a very strong proof of this, 
the. Royal Infirmary of this city, where epi- 
demic diseases, however prevalent they may 
be, seldom; I may say never, affect any 
of the attendants, or the numerous students 
who daily visit that valuable institution. It 
may be urged, that habit may, in a great 
measure, prevent their being infected, but 
this supposition must fall, when it is recol- 
lected that our infirmary is built in a fully 
inhabited part of the city surrounded in 
some parts, within thirty feet of the windows 
of the fever wards, by the dwelling houses of 
the inhabitants, who are never known to be 
affected by similar diseases. The inhabitants 
are so fully convinced of the safety of being 
ated even so near these feVer wards, that 
a piece of ground immediately contiguous to 
them, although it furnishes sites for five 
houses only, was lately sold for nearly the im- 
mense siHTi of 10,000l., has been built upon, 
and the inhabitants of it are quite ex- 



26 



empted for these sort of complaints which 
e^ist in the hospital. 

Thus, by proper regulations, many dis- 
eases may be prevented, and consequently 
the comforts of life augmented without any 
material increase of expenditure. The dif* 
ference between disease and health must 
have been felt by the majority of us. When, 
during the day, the little strength we posses*- 
sed has been nearly exhausted ; aqd when, the 
night arriving, we are unabje to procure a 
moment's refreshing sleep, we at spch times 
anxiously compare our state with that of 
those who are in the vigour of health, by 
whom the tediousness of sleepless hours is 
never felt. Then,

This h6lhg too oft^n ilegletled, many livesi 
highly valuable to their cbuntry, are either

terminate only with their existence. 

ITie same may be observed respecting all 
manufactories where great quantities of ani*

as among tallow-chandlers, glue-makers, &c. 
These, though in most instances little in-

greater virulence than where such contami-^

such occasions, the contagious virus acquir- 
ing additional force, extends its devastations 
to much greater extent than if no such cir- 
cumstances had aided its propagation and| 
extension, .

It is absolutely necessary that physicians 
should study more than they do, the nature 
of the various kinds of aliment on the bus- 
man body ; without which, they must re- 
main ignorant of many of the principal 
causes of disease, and consequently of the 
proper means of obviating or of removing 
them. 
Influence As to diet, it may be observed, that hop- 
hM already P^^ "^^^^^ wine^and vinous liquors, coming 
had. more into general use, have been some means 



19 - 

of suppressing putrid diseases. While greens 
and fruits, also are more universally eaten^ 
salted meats make a much less part of diet 
than formerly. To this is added the more 
general consumption of tea and sugar, which 
are possessed of no inconsiderable antiseptic 
qualities. These things, doubtless, may be 
much abused, and thus be vproductive of 
effects of a very different nature. To this 
antiseptic quality of sugar, which for above 
a hundred years past, has been daily joined, 
in large quantities to other ascescent food, 
we may perhaps ascribe some share of the 
general decline of putrid diseases ; for, now, 
we seldom hear of leprosies, putrid scurvies, 
dysenteries, plagues, pestilential fevers and 
similar distempers, formerly so frequent; 
and to which those were peculiarly subject 
who used animal food in excess, especially 
salted meats. 

General rules for living, are perhaps the Egrets 
most difficult part of the duty of the phy- lii^ciy to 
sician ; and although this fact is very evi- it. 
dent, I am sorry it has so seldom been con- 
sidered in the important point of view to 
which it is so justly entitled. Were more 
attention paid to this subject, many diseases 
which we every day and in every country 
meet with, and which we vainly, and often 
perniciously attempt to drive away by the 



30 



there force of drugs, would, by attehtion to 
this and ope or two other similarly simple 
rules, be more effectually and more benefi- 
cially removed (at least for the patient) thati 
ever can be expected to happen, when such 
monstrous loads of medicines are adminis- 
tered. 

Were proper regulations adopted, which 
would have for their basis the principles of 
common reason and common sense, I think 
much of this destructive custom might be 
prevented. The task may be difficult ; but 
it ought not, on that account, to be almost 
entirely laid aside. 

General ^^ i i • i« • i 

Rules on General rules in livmg may, under cer- 
this Sub- ^^\^ restrictions, be attended with bene- 
fit. In winter, to resist the cold, the ali- 
ment ought to be dry and warmitig. In 
spring, when the weather grows mild, the 
diet should be accommodated to the season^ 
and somewhat cooler and lighter. In sum- 
mer^ when the season becomes hot and dry, 
the food should be cooling, and the drink 
dilating. But after the autumnal equinox, 
the aliment should again be of a warming 
nature, and your clothes thicker, by degrees 
as you approach the winter. In summer :

Yet when pale seasons rise^ or winter rolls 
His horrors o'er the worlds thou mayst indulge

Still it must be recollected that there ex- 
ists a wide difference between indulgence 
in living, and irregularity. An observance 
of this, during every season, is absolutely 
necessary to the preservation of human 
health. 

If due attention were paid to regularity in 
living, imder which I include those sub- 
stances used in the form of meat and drink, 
I am convinced that the greater proportion of 
the diseases which we every day see around 
us, would never have existed. Then 

^^— ^ — Frugal be your cups : the languid frame. 
Vapid and sunk from yesterday*^ debauch. 
Shrinks from the cold embrace of wat'ry heavens.*' 

I admit that such instances may be long 
persevered in, without apparently producing 
any bad effect; but they nevertheless se- 
cretly undermine the constitution, and, when 
age approaches, it comes with double hor- 
rors in its train. It therefore ought to be 
recollected, that every extreme is an enemy 
to nature. I confess, that after these habits 



32 



have been indulged in, it is difficult to alter 
them, and to fly from one extreme to ano- 
ther is highly dangerous. Even those things 
which are in themselves bad, as dram drmk- 
ing, chewing tobacco, sitting up late at 
night, sleeping immediately after dinner, 
morning whetSy as they are called, &c., 
should be relinquished by degrees : 

'^ Tis fit that man. 

To change obnoxious, be to change inur'd* 
But stay the curious appetite, and taste 
With caution fruits ^ou never tried before. 
For want of use the kindest aliment 
Sometimes offends; while custom tames the rage

Every person who attends to his own con- 
stitution, and the effect of different kinds 
of aliment, will be able to form better rules 
for himself in- this respect, than are to be 
expected from a physician. If these little 
particulars are attended to, and even the 
common feelings, of our nature are not 
grossly abused, the necessity of having re- 
course to drugs, for the most part only ne-. 
cessary when such conduct is indulged in, 
will be very rare. These are benefits which 
we can confer on ourselves, and we have 
ourselves to blame, if we abuse them.

With regard to diet, I may observe, that 
he may be convinced that he has committed 
no excess, who immediately after dinner 
can write or walk, or go about any other ne- 
cessary business with pleasure ; and if, after 
supper, his sleep be not disturbed, or short- 
ened by what he has eat or drank; if he has 
no headach next mornings nor any uncom« 
mon haughing or spitting, nor a bad taste in 
his mouth ; but rises at his usual hour re* 
freshed and chearful. 

If base custom has not in any of these re- 
spects injured us; if we have not indulged 
so far in luxury or debauchery, that refrain- 
ing from sucl> practices would be more de- 
structive of life, than even the indulgence 
in them, let us

dren, we contribute greatly to prevent ma-

Of Flesh The flesh of quadrupeds^ as it contains a 

^^^^^ • great proportion of oily matter, is a h^bly 

nutritious aliment, provided only we use 

no more than the digestive organs can pro-> 

perly assimilate. 

The flesh of the male is always more 
dense than that of the female ; and the den-' 
sity of every animal always increases as the 
animal advances in life/so that young meat is 
universally more soluble than old. The 
flesh of young animals, therefore, is more 
easily digested than the flesh of old ones ; 
and that of carniverous animals is more dif* 
ficult of digestion, and less nutritious, than 
the flesh of the grarainiverous tribe, which 
is firmer, contains less fluid, and hence 
affords more nourishment. It may be ad- 
ded, that the flesh of tame animals is more 
nourishing than that otgame^ 

The flesh of animals is most nourishing 
when they are much , exposed to the open 
air, and are kept in dry, warm places. On 
the contrary, the flesh of grown cattle which 
have been confined in bad air, and which 
have led an inactive life, is far from being' 
wholesome food. 

Well fed animals, also, thougli not the 
masses of fat in them, are easierof digestion 
than lean animals, whose fibres are closeJ^r 
compacted together. All kinds oi fat and

we ought; i»orf particularly to use to the fat

it more ea^ly digestible. 

The blood of animals is completely in-*

every species of animals who give suck. TC 
is rendered of an unpleasant and disgusting 
taste. Nurses of children ought to attend 
to this fact. 

I believe it is hardly ever necessary to give 
children under the age of puberty any quan- 
tity of animal food ; and we have innumer- 
able instances in this country of children 
reared to the most perfect health and strength 
without the use of it, except the small quan- 
tity of it that is given by an egg, and this 
very sparingly and seldom bestowed. Oa 
the contrary, anicnal food among children 
has often very hurtful effects. 

The density of beef is always greater than 
that of mutton ; indeed in the ox, it is dens-* 
er than in any other quadruped. On ac- 
count of the extreme density of bull-flesh it 
is seldom chosen as part of our diet : In the 
female, however, if well fed, and within three 
years of age, it is more soluble and sufH* 
ciently fit for nourishment ; but in the ox the 
fat is better mixed, the flesh more sapid, and, 
unless old, is in general to be preferred. 

The flesh of a good bullock is equal, if 
not superior to any other ; and its fat is as 
easily digested as that of veal. The tongue 
and the tripe are the most indigestible parts 
of this animal. 1 here allude to bullocks 
kept much in- the open air ; for those kept 



37 



in stall s, and for the most part confined, af e, 
as well as cows, (which indeed are worse 
than bullock's) scarcely at all digestible. 

Feal is the young ox, it is very soluble, Vcai. 
^ives a more gelatinous extract thain the flesh 
of the adult; but is not more nutritious. 
Under two months, it is of a soft texture ; 
but after that the muscular fibre becoming 
more distinguishable, the flesh acquires a 
greater degree of toughness. Veal, then, 
is a food of easy digestion ; but not so nu- 
tritious, as the same animal in a state 
of maturity. Tt ought not to be brought 
to market before it is at least six weeks old, 
and fed, if possible by its mother's milk. Its 
fat is lighter than any other. Veal ought 
never to be boiled, as the juices are (oo 
easily separated from it, and what remains is 
very difficult of digestion. 

Mutton reared in dry pastures is prefer^ Mutton. 
abl^ to that reared in itioist places. The 
flesh of rams is tough and unpleasant ; but 
that of ewes and wedders is of a rich viscous 
nature. The best mutton is that of sheep not 
less than three and not above six years old. 
Under three years, although it is juicy, it is 
tough, and has not attained its perfection 
and flavour. 

The lamb is generally best when two or Lamb. 
three months old, but in the early part of 

c 



38 



the year, it is often killed when not more 
than as many weeks. If good, its fat is 
easily digestible. The flesh €f all ani- 
mals, such as house lamb, reared within 
doors, being unnatural, their flesh is insipic^ 
and can only be valned because it is unsea- 
sonable. 
P(»k. Under similar circumstances, beef or 

mutton is certainly more capable of afibrd* 
ing nourishment than pork ; partly from the 
latter living in close sties, without being al* 
lowed to take exercise, which renders their 
flesh strong and indigestible. This may be 
removed by altering the mode of training 
these animals, which would probably render 
their flesh, particularly when young, easily 
digestible. In the sow, the young has 
much less oily matter about it than the 
old, and is much easier digested by many 
who are unable to assimilate the old. 
What is known by the name of brawn 
consists of pork with the oil well squeezed 
out. It is not readily soluble ; but to those 
stomachs that can dissolve it, it affords a 
great deal of nourishment. The flesh of 
wild hogs, on account of their exposure to 
air and exercise, is more palatable, more 
easily digested, less tough and not so tat ar 
the others^

The flesh, or those parts of birtU which 
we employ as aliments, are nearly of the 
same qualitres as those of quadrupeds. T^e 
flesh of birds^ however, is less nourish- 
ing than that of quadrupeds, though in 
general easier digested. Birds living- on 
grain and berries are more wholesome food 
than those which subsist in swampy and fil-* 
thy places, and live on worms, insects, and 
fish.

the young of these animals, the chicken^ is^ 
as in the instance of veal, more soluble than 
the old, yet, in some instances, it is not 
more easily digested, but the contrary* 
Before a year old, the difference arising 
from the sex of birds is not very remarkable; 
but after that period it becomes more and 
more considerable. Castration has a great 
effect in rendering these animals more rapid-r 
ly fat, and in enabling them to retain their 
tenderness longer. Young hens or ca* 
pon are more delicate dishes when not 
stuffe d by indigestible materials before pre- 
paring for the table ; and barn door fowlii 
are certainly unexceptionable food ; but 
it would appear that the cracimed fowl it

though there is considerable difference in 
the firmness of the substince'bf differcfirt

of other animals. Age seems to have lit- 
tle effect in rendering their texture firmer 
than in early life. In some piersons, during

Eggs contain a large proportion of nutri-* 
tious matter, but do not seem of a very sti- 
mulant nature. Eggs of different animalt^ 
seem very little different in their properties^ 
from each other ; and even those animalsi 
whose flesh is of the rankest taste and smell^i 
give eggs entirely free from either. 



The best milk is obtained from the cow 
at three or four years old, and about three 
months after producing the calf. It ought 
to be white, and without any smell. 
Ewes milk is rich and nourishing; both 
it and goats milk produce much cheese; 
which is tough, strong, pungent, and dif&* 
cult to be digested. No acid substances 
ought to be eat along with milk^ as a coagu- 
lum would be formed. 

Different kinds of milk seem to have pro- 
perties in common with each other. They 



45 



spKmtaneousIy' separate into cream^ curd and 
fiketf. Cream is of ^n oily unctuous nature, 
still containing a certain quantity of both 
the cOagulable and watery parts of milk« 
When agitated by churning, butter is sepa» 
rated from it. Butter not well freed from 
butter*milk, more readily becomes rancid, 
than that which is more entirely freed from 
it ; is preserved longer fr«e from rancidity 
by being kept for a short time melted, and, 
with the application of sea salt, with a little 
nitre and sugar, butter may be preserved a 
very long time. 

When the cream has been removed from 
the milk, a coagulum, or curd, is formed, 
tkki watery particles separate, and both 
a(k)uire some degree of acidity. They may, 
however, be separated, and when a sub* 
9tahee called runnel is added to the coagu- 
him, it becomes firmer, and thus: the matter 
of cheese is formed. Runnel i^ formed by 
filling the fourth stomach of a calf with 
niilk, which is there coagulated; and the 
stomach, with the coagulum included, is 
preserved for use in salt water. . 

The watery part of milk or whey is at least 
leven^eighths of the whole milk. It is ca- 
pable of vinous fisrmentation, and conse- 
quently of affording by distillation an ardent

•'The seeds of pltats^rfe the chief part of Farina 
our vegetable aliment in almost every part *° ^^^ ' 
of the world. They contain much farma- 
deoufc mattef,; which, conti^ining a great 
proportion of saceharinie matter, renders it 
of all v^etable products^ the most nourish- 
ing to men^ as well as to domestic animals^ 



48 



Farinaceous substances are very widely 
distributed over the earth, and when made 
into bread, are used alongst with almost ev- 
ery morsel of other foods, as if instinctively. 
The Laplanders, in want of the vegetable- 
farinacea, powder fish bones^ and employ it 
in bread. 

Wheat Jlour is the most generaHy used 
farinaceous substance, almost all overiEti- 
rope. For use, in the form of bread, it is 
moistened with water, allowied to undergo a 
certain degree of acescent fermentation^ 
which may be accelerated by yest or lees of 
ale ; it is then dried or baked in an' ov^n^ 
by which it is swelled into a larger bulk,; 
becomes spongy, and is readily miscible with 
the saliva, and with our other food. Wheat 
is the only farinaceous substance, that af- 
fords a perfect bread by fermentation, whe- 
ther spontaneous, or by the assistance of 
yest, &c. ; but it does not, even indepen- 
dently of the gelatinous matter it contains^ 
seem more nourishing than the other fiiri- 
nacea. 

Oat meal is especially used among the 
lower classes of the people in Scotland. It 
is sufficiently nourishing, notwithstanding of 
its being used in an unfermented state, as is 
proved by appearance of those people who 
use it most. In some, indeed, it produces 



49 



heart-burn^ which is owing to its being un- 
fermented ; wheat meal in the same state^ 
would produce the same effect. 

PorridgCj made of this meai^ is not so 
heavy as that of wheat-flour, but both re- 
quire most healthy organs for their diges- 
tion. 

Barley contains a much smallet* proportion 
of oil than some other grains, and upon that 
account is less nourishing than those of 
others. Being more subject to vinous fer-" 
mentation than most seeds, it is the grain 
from which very universally our beers and 
ales are prepared* 

Aft^T decoction^ the grosser plirts of the 
barley ought not to be eaten^ as they possess 
no nutritive principle^ 

Oats and pease are more nourishing than 
jbarley, and therefore^ in countries where 
much barley is used, it is ibund necessary to 
mix with it a quantity of oats or peas. 
Beans, p^as,. lentils and the like, afford a 
rich and strong nutriment, but they best 
>agree with a vigorous stomach. To many 
people, this food produces heartburn, flatu« 
lence. and postiveness^ particularly if eaten 
frequently pnd copiously ; they are therer 
(ore improper for daily use. 

Green peas, &c. are more easy of diges- 
tion ; indeed all vegetables of this kind, as 



50 



they advance io growth, become nu^re c^ 
pressive to the stomach* 

Rye-tready though less nourishing, ' is 
more easily digested than bread made- of 
wheat. 

Sago is the medulary pari of a species of 
palm-tree, reared in several East India 
islands. The natives macerate it, and form 
it into cakes. As presented to us, it ought 
to be cleaned of dust, mould and sea-water. 
To m&ke a complete decoction of sago, the 
first decoction ought to be strained, and then 
boiled a second time for about half an hour. 
This farinaceous matter comes to us in a 
granulated form. When boiled, it is resolv- 
ed into an insipid and ahnost transparent 
jelly. From the quantity of gelatinous 
matter it contains, it affords a considerable* 
degree of nourishment, and is often used 
for weakly persons. 

New baked bread is much more indiges« 
iible than after it has been kept two or three 
days. If this cannot be done, it ought t6 
be toasted. Those troubled with flatulen-* 
cy, cramp of the stomach and indigestion^ 
should not, on any account, eat new breads

requires a proper quantity of tnoist food 
^loog with it, or drink to render it more 
easy of digestion* Its excellent nourishment 
is sufficiently obvious in the healthiness of 
those country people, particularly in Ire- 
land, whose principal food is of potatoes* 
Animals, ; too, are easily fattened on them. 
Those of the farinaceous kind are much

XK»as.kihd« 

,jdrrow, rooty affords a larger proportion of 
nutritive mucilage than any vegetable hi- 
therto discovered, and ought to be used in 
broths, &c. •' 

Beet root conta^is a large proportion of 
saccharine mattef. It possesses mild ape- 
rient qualities, is econdmical • for culinary 
purposes, and ought to be> used for 8op)$ef 
by-tho^e who ane pf a costive* habit. ' ' It, 
faawevei?, possesses flatulent qtialitteB, -and 
thenef(6re ought to ■ be used with parsley, 
celel'yi.orevsen; potatoes.- ni . 

Carrots are very flatulent, and therefore 
improper food for the weak. 



52 



Parsnips possess an arbniatic principle, and 
are less flatulent than carrots. 

TumipSy when boiled, are easily digested^ 
and occasion little flatulence. They have 
some sweetness ; but do not seem to contain 
much nourishment in proportion to their 
bulk. They are yellow and white. The 
yellow, while it is easiest preserved during 
the winter, and therefore of more extensive 
iise^ is more sweet and seemingly more nu- 
tritious than the whiter They are not easy 
of digestion, if kept long in cellars. The 
long Swedish turnip is to be preferred. 

Radishes^ when old, are extremely indiges* 
tible ; when small, however, they are less so^ 
They assist in increasing the appetite, and 
therefore, ought to be used a little before 
rather than after dinner. 

Onions, leeksy garlic^ eschalot and chives^ 
are stiAiuIant, and assist digestion. They 
are most useful in cold phlegmatic habits ; 
but from the disagreeable penetrating smell 
which they impart to the breath, they can^ 
not be generally or constantly used. 

Celery is the most fragrant root we possess 
in onr climate. It is digested with some 
difficulty, which may be removed by boiling 
it in water, or soaking it, for a short time 
in vinegar.

Figs, a very saccharine fruit, united with a: 
large proportion of mucilaginous matter^ 
were anciently the chief food of the athletae 
or public wrestlers. Dates possess qualities 
somewhat similar. 

Apples and Peats, except the very hard, 
or the winter kind, are agreeable and possess 
a pleasant but mild acid. When apples are 
tstewed^ in particular, they are easily digested 
and wholesome. 

Grapes contain a large proportion of sugar, 
and are, if used without their husks, the 
safest and most nutritive of summer fruits. 

Plumbs, cherries, tamarinds, peaches, apri^ 
tots, &c. are, when used ripe, very agreeable^ 
possessing a pleasant, mild and grateful acid. 
They must be carefully avoided when unripe, 
and their stones, when swallowed, are often 
attended with the worst consequences, by 
lodging in the intestines and producing the 
most fatal symptoms. These have common- 
ly a larger proportion of acid with respect 
to their sugar than some other fruits ; and 
therefore, with the exception of the last, in 
a great measure, produce acidity, and diarr- 
hoea.

Vegetables Vegetables imbued with any strong odour 
or taste, are in general rejected from the list 
of aliments, the acid and sweet being pre-^ 
ferred. 

Caufiftower and broccoli are tender, easi^

The young shoots of asparagus, when 
boiled in water, are tender, somewhat sweet 
and mucilaginous, and may therefore be

Herbs, such as cabbage, spinnage, and 
the like, afford little nourishment. They 
are cooling, and may be freely used in sum- 
mer. When boiled^ they are of a laxative 
nature. 

Cabbages are white and red, the last oft 
which is very indigestible; they all afford 
nourishment; but in some produce flatu- 
lence in the bowels ; the latter is the sweet- 
er and tenderer kind.

' White Cabbage is' possessed of much less 
flatulerit qualities than the common greens, 
and 18 somewhat laxative and diuretic. This 
vegetable sliced in thin shreds, and after- 
ward seasoned and isalted, is the saizer kraut 
of the Germans. This preparation is easily 
digested ; and is extremely useful at sea, as 
it can be kept a very great length of time. 
Captain Cook experienced the happiest ef«

venting epidemic distempers, partioulariy 
dysentery, fevers, &c Vegetable^, apt to, 
produce flatulence, may have this quality 
removed by thoroughly boiling them, or 
flaaking them into this sauer kraut before 
using them. 

Spinnage affords but little nourishment, 
as it passes quicUy through the stomach 
and bo wiels aUnost undigested. In debility

Water, without any addition, is ^certainly

not always happen, as in the waters distiii^

The spring and well water of san^ or

than any other. River, rain, snow and lake 
water, aro more apt to be loaded by a varietur 
of putrifying substances, which render them

filtering these waters through a quantity

(hffee is a pleasant beverage, and, when Coffee, 
used in moderation, promotes all the healthy ^^*' *^ 
ftinctic^s of the stomaeh. When too much 
roasted, it is rendered insipid; but when 
not sufficiently roasted, the coffee acquires 
^ bitter and an unpleasant flavour* 

To prepare coffbe, Uie best proportion is

The coffee of the Levant far excels that 
imported fraiA the We$t Indies, whieh is 
frequently steeped in sea* water, to make it 
weigh l^eavieTb * We can detect this by 
sowing the taw coffee in water, and exa- 
mining the taste of the liquor, if coffee he 
drunk immediately after dinner with a view 
.to promote digestion, it requires no milk to 
dilute and render it weaker ; but^ at break-

fast, it requires niilk to sheath the eiiipyreu* 
matic oil it contains. 

All kinds of mock coffee, made of lye, 
wheat, pease, dried carrots, beet, the tuc^ 
cory root, &c. have little resemblance to it,

Beer. Fermented liquors areof two kinds ; wineti^ 

when prepared from the juices of fruits ; 
aleSi when extracted by water from certain 
seeds and roots. 

Sugar, or substances containing it, are 
the subjects capable of being changed by 
fermentation. The sugar is in part con* 
verted into alcohol, and the juice of the fruits, 
in consequence of fermentation mixing with 
it, constitutes wine ; and it is this which, 
differently modified with the addition of 



6i 



othef matteray gives wine, all its difieTent 
forms and qualities. 

Beer, made of a great proportion of hops, 
and a small quantity of malt, gives tone to 
the stomach, is a good beverage, and well 
calculated to allay thirst. 

Plethoric persons agree best with light 
beer, but wet-nurses and the debilitated re« 
quire the thick nourishing beer, which is 
more strengthening. It is only the weak, the 
lean and the laborious, provided they are 
not troubled with flatulence, who should 
make habitual use of beer or porter. Those 
also who take a great proportion of vegeta- 
ble food, and have a weakly stomach, uill 
find a stfdqg and bitter beer salutary. 

Strortg beer is very nourishing, and may 
be employed with advantage as a medicine, 
in emaciated habits. 

jiies are ip general prepared from farina^ 
ceous seeds. By fermentation, or by con- 
ducting: their germination to a certain de- 
gree, sugar is evolved. This is extracted 
by water^ which, being subjected to fermen- 
tation, forms ale, containing a quantity of 
alcohol. Barley, from the quantity of sugar 
it contains, is most commonly, though 
jaot exclusively, used for this purpose. 
Ales are stronger or weaker, however^ 
according to the quantity of saccharine 



6i 



mstter employed^ which depeadi grettly ob 
the state of the farina used. 

The juke of malt or wort is not sa 
much disposed to fermentation as the jutoc^ 
of fruits^ and therefore reqaices a feraoent 
to be added to it. 

Alcohol thus blended with fernMnted It- 
qnors is not nearly so inflammatorj as when 
used in a diluted state, or even when a 
combination with acid and sugar. 
Wine. The sweet wtnes of Hungary, Spam, I(a« 

]y, Greece, ami the Malaga, Malmsey, Mo^ 
deira, and Cape wines, if genuine, si&bfd a 
true medicine to the weal^ an4 conVales-^ 
cent. 

Of weakly acidulated wines, old Rhenishj^ 
Champaign, those of Mosel, of the Neckar, 
Franconia, and Austria, are the chief ; of 
these the Rhenish, Mosel, and Cbampaigti 
are the best. 

The acid and tart wines, which ate apt t^ 
produce headach, complaints in the sto^ 
macb, &c. are those of Tburingia^ Saxony^ 
Silesia, and some parts of Brandenburg. 

The acidulated sweet wines, such as the

tore, and thepelbre ought only to be used fbr 
medicinal purposes. 

We ought, so far as we can, to preserve 
the tliree xonstituent parts of wines unadul^ 
lerated by any subetance from the vesseki 
in which they are made. They are all com- 
|icsed of pure spirit, water, and sugar, and 
whea theae are alone cofnbined, and aroma« 
tics afterwards added to impart to them fla* 
vonr, we may imitate any wine, while we 
preserve it free from deleterious quahties. 

Kegua is one of the most innocent and

Jf wine be adulterated with sulphur, a 
piece of silver, or even the shell cH an egg 
<lipt in it, wUl become black ; if with lime, 
a thin pellicle will form on its surface, if it 
%e flowed to stand in a glass for a day or 
two ; if with water, when poured on lime» 
'Stone, it Wakens it, but if the wine be pure, 
the lime remains whole. 

To discover metallic particles in wine, we 
have the following test: One drachm of 
^ertastris, potassse, or cream of tartar, and 
two drachms of sulphuretum potassse or liver 
of sulphure, are shaken in two ounces 
of distilled water till it be completely 
saturated ; the liquor is then filtered 
through blotting paper^ and kept in a close 



64 



stopped phial. Sixteen or twenty drops maj^ 
be put into a glass of wine^ and if a thick while 
sediment be deposited, the wine cont^^ins no 
metallic ingredients ; but if it turn black or 
even muddy, or of a dark red, if it have first 
a sweet, and then an astringent taste, it is 
impregnated with sugar of lead, or some 
equally pernicious preparation of that metal. 
If, however, it be of a dark blue, like pale 
ink, it contains iron in solution; and if 
white wine be impregnated with copper of 
verdigrease, it will deposit a blackish grey 
sediment. The test should be fresh pre^ 
pared, and the experiment made in the open 
air. 

The brass cocks used to draw off all acid 
liquors ought to be abolished, as they imt* 
part a noxipu^ quality to the liquor. 

Ardent spirits, when very gradually dift- 
Spirits. tilled, consist of npthing but pure spirit and 
water^ and are as wholesome when iiew as if 
kept any length of time. When quickly 
distilled, however, according to the p]:esent 
custom, to save duty, it contains a poison^* 
ous empyreumatic oil, the destruction of 
which is necessary before it can be used 
with safety, and this is effected by time. 

Rectified spirits ought to have only five 
parts, and proof spirits four-fifths of distil- 
led water in the hundred. The specific 



Ardent 



«s 



gravity of the former is 83 5^ and that of 
tiie latter gSO to iOOO. 

Although ardent spirits, in the various 
forms in which it is used, are perhaps the 
most frequent cause of derangement in the 
digestive organs, yet in many complaints of 
these organs it may be used with evident 
advantage. It is not the use, but the abuse, 
of ardent spirits that renders them injurious. 
They may be used in moderation with great 
propriety, but the abuse of them is always 
injurious^ 

• • Ardent spirits, when taken in moderation, 
and by a person not oth^ivise hurt by 
them, are extremely useful in preventing the 
bad effects of cold moist atmosphere, of 
pestilential vapours, unclean occupations, 
and in a damp military camp. 

After violent exercise and heat, a dram 
of spirits is more proper than cdd water or 
beer, though a cup of tea or other diluent 
drink is preferable. A dram to remove 
flatulence can only be serviceable when the 
stomach is undepraved ; but otherwise it is 
hurtful. 

The addition of acid to ardent spirits, as 
in punch, in general renders them still more 
pi^cjudicial to the stomach ; on the same 
{winciple, a, dram after fruit is absurd. >

Thus exercise, sleeping, &c. must be regu-, 
lated by the feelings of individuals^ Mid en* 
tirely given up or persevered in by the good 
or bad effects produced in coM^uence of 
them. 

Gentle exercise^ before taking victualsii 
increases our appetite ; but when this is iiw. 
dulged to excess^ it fatigues and mcapaci* 
tates every power of the body^ and rendeni: 
it unfit to perform its proper fimcticms. 

When the digestion is languid^ we ought 
not to go to bed or to sleep after dinner^ for- 
then digestion, with every other function^ hk. 
carried on with less vigour and more tardily 
than when awake. Being awake, is of iU 
self a species of exercise necessary for the. 
office of digestion, pilrticularly in those whose 
powers in that way are weak. 

We can more easily digest a heavy meal 
in four hours of accelerated respiration and 
muscular action during the day, than in 
aght hours of sleep. 

. If sleeping for a short time after dinner^r 
be at all justifiable, it must only be in weak# 
ly persons^ and those exhausted by age.

When thta habit it indulged irii the body 
ought to be placed rather in a recliniqg than 
in a horizontal posture, aSi in the latter^ 
headacbs are apt to be induced. 



Man alone submits his victuals, before Modes «f 
using them, t<i the art of cookery. This i« prepariox 
efln^cted by tjubjecting them, particularly 
when of the animal kind, to salting, pick* 
iing, &Ci Or by exposing them m various 
ways to difi^nt degrees of heat. This art, 
faoweva*> does not aeem either so uniformly 
or tndMd so necessarily applied to a great 
VAriety ef vegetable substances. It renders 
the ttesttfire of diments more tender, and 
consequently m^re soluble in the stomach. 

As it is certainly the gelatinous part of 
animal food that is the mosf nutritious, lit* 
tie, if any of which enters into the compp- 
aition of the fibres, every kind or degree of 
cooking which such substances are made to 
undergo, which either separates this quality^ 
or in any way destroys it, must render that 
meat less nutritious than when it is preserv<* 
ed in combination with the animal fibres. 
Thus, too much or too long salting, over^* 
roasting, boiling, &c. must tH very material^ 



68 



ly injure the quality of animal food ; while, 
on the contrary, by moderately boiling, 
roasting, &c« these substances are at once 
rendered more tender, easier soluble in the 
stomach, and more likely to afford nourish- 
ment to the body than by being prepared 
as above. By over or too long salting, &c. 
the gelatinous principle is destroyed^ as is 
often the case in ship-beef; by over- roasting, 
baking, &c. it is separated ; and by over- 
boiling, the nourishing parts of it are dif- 
fused in the soup with which it was boiled. 

The solubility of meats, in other respects 
of the same qualities, is greater according 
as they happen to be &rther advanced to* 
ward putrefaction. It is owing to this that 
meats recently killed, are not so soluble as 
those that have been kept for sometime. All 
meat of this kind ought, therefore, before it 
is prepared for use, to be exposed to the 
open air for a few days, longer or shorter, 
according to the weather and season. 

Fish dried in the open air, and afterwards 
boiled soft, are easily digested ; but all salted 
sea-fish, as well as smoaked fish, are injuri- 
ous to the stomach, and afford little nutria 
tion. 

If salted meats be taken in moderate quan* 
tity only, the salt has the effect of exciting 
the powers of digestion ; and such meats 



6g 



are often niore easily digested than eritirely 
unfliaUed meats are. It may, howeverf.with 
safety, b^ averted, that fresh meat^ provideid 
it is properly cooked; is more wholesome, 
nourishing, and inore easily digestedr than 
salted tneat. * . 

Animsfl'food preserved by vinegar is hard* 
ly Her so much impregnated with: it a$ to 
be rendered less dige^ible or less nutritious. 
It. renders it otily less patresceilt ; and there- 
fore it is a cdndirtient of animal food^ suited, 
ineviery respect^ to tbehuman constitution. 

Salads, eatbn with oil and vinegar,, require 
all the powers of tb'i stomach to digest them; 
therfefere ought to be avoided by those of 
debilttaited 'Stomachs^ Ml smoked meat, 
thongb prejudicial tp the stomach; is more ea- 
sily digested while in. a raw thian in a boiled 
state. The act of smoking had partly se- 
parated the gelatinous and juicy particles 
fro'm.the' fibres, which boiling entirely re- 
moves, rendering tte Remainder extremely 
difficult of digestion. Such food, there- 
fore, requires very little of this or any othej? 
process. 

It has been computed, that, from the dissi- 
pation of these juices in boiling, one pound 
of roasted contains aa much nourishment 
a& two ^pi^nds of the same kind of meat 
kbiled. . '}

The modes of preparing meat moat ttd|ipt* 
tfd to preserve these jaices hi close don- 
tact with the fibres, are the best^ such m 
iKtewing ; baked meat, (notincltidingthepaste) 
is probably the next best method^ and next

Eggs, pitf tictilarly hens, are next in nntri^

Magnesia and rhubarb, to correct the aci- 
dity with bitters, &c. to strengthen the tone 
of the stomach, are the best methods of re- ' 
moving it. 

We find that, owing to the particuYar na« * 
ture of some substances, as well as to the 
particular states of the digestive organs^* 
some kinds of food pass through the alimen- 
tary canal without affording any nourish-' 
ment to the body. To remedy this, w^ 
must know whether the fault rests with the * 
organs, or with the food, which may very 
easily be ascertained. 

' If the state of the evacuations be disor- ' 
dered, the most rigorous observance of die- • 
tetic rules will be insufficient to insure oof- 
health; while, on the contrary, most of 
these rules may be neglected for some time 
without any injurious consequences, if the' 
evacuations be regular. / » 

Inattention to suitable food and drink 
renders laxative medicines necessary, which- 
by proper attention tothese particulars mights 
be dispensed with. By this inattention we,* 
at length, produce diseases of these pafts, - 
which often require the aid of the most ao- ' 
tive medicines to remove.

fruit, particularly prunes,- decoctions of cur- 
rants, and the sweet and -^molient vegeta- 
Wpp, particularly the beet-root, sweet table- 
beer, infusions pf malt, apples, pears, &c. 

No medicine whatever ought to be used 
as daily food, — a favourite custom among 
invalids, valetudinarians, and the votaries of 
quack medicines. 

Either food or drink taken in such quan* 
tity, or of such quality, as cannot with ease be 
digested by the stomach, must induce dis- 
ease of that organ, or. of the system inge* 
neral ; and medicines taken under such cir- 
cumstances to assist the digestive powers, 
only tend in a r greater degree to enfeeble 
its powers when their operation has sub- 
sided.

Sect. IV. — Police for Marnier^* 

ckanii. Under the present head, cleanliness, in 
^^^* every variety of form, is a principal ol:gect 
to be attended to. 

The streets should be washed and kept 
clean from filth, carrion, and all manner of 
tiuisances, which should be carried away in 
the night-time: nor should lay- stalls be au& 
fered to be too near the city. Beggars, 
and idle, and dirty persons, should be taken 
up, and such miserable objects, as are nei- 
ther fit for common hospitals, nor work- 
houses, should.be provided for in an hospi- 
tal of incurables ; for while puddles of putrid 
nastiness, and piles of reeking dung, or li- 
ving beings equally filthy, are incessantly 
exhaling their poisonous steams, that magis* 
tracy consults very imperfectly the public 



83 



ti^afth) whii^H neglicts the r^tnoral of toeh 
tottiffton nuisances. ^ 

f rt respect to h6ia:3es, the first e&re ought 
lo be to keep them clean ; for, as feaWiittes^s 
'fe a gfeat souree of itifeetion, S6 cleanliness 
^ the greftte^ pre^efrvative ; which she^ft us 
the tnie reason V^hy the poor lire iM«t ob- 
noxious to contagious diseases. That they

tv^ one ; but ^*^lrig, for the mofet part, I 
betiere^ to that torpidity of mitkd^ so itid<- 
Heftt to individual, in the sphere of life in 
^^hich they are dbUged to m<6ve, they sel- 
iSiMi <H- tiever> indeed, attempt to reflect on 
tl^ dflfigera vvhfch they thus daily subject 
themselves to» 

It k iMlancholy, that such immeiiise num'^ 
bers ^f people should be thus bacrificed^ 
when mamiers of a vMte pleasant, and in 
^very respect less irksome^ nature would re- 
lieve them. Sii^e, however, these steps 
We not iikdy to be voltintarily adopted by 
them ; it were inuch to be \mhed, that the 
^proprietors of these houses, i^re obliged t6 
take oi^ a license, and frequently to purify 
them ^nder the eye of an Inspeclor. And 
€Ven af^ all this, every possible care ought 
utiH to be tak^n, to remove v^atever canses 
are found to biieed a^nd promote obntagvo^* 
In order to th»i, the overseers of the poOr 



84 



should visit the dwellings of all the meaner 
sort of the inhabitants, and wherever they 
find them stifled up, too close^ and nasty, 
should lessen their number, by sending some 
of them to other lodgings, and should take 
care, by all manner of provision and encou« 
ragement, to make them more cleanly ^and 
sweet. 

This mode of procedure would answer, at 
least, two purposes. It would prevent those, 
whose minds are degraded to the lowest 
pitch, and to whom nastiness and cleanness 
are equally pleasant, from infecting the 
neighbouring ^ir, by the exhalations con- 
stantly issuing from their persons, &c., and 
thereby disseminating the most loathsomis 
of all diseases. It would ptoduce a still bet* 
ter eflect 6n another class of individuals, 
whose minds had not yet sunk to that gulf 
of depravity with those j ust mentioned ; bu| 
who, by perseverance in similar habits, 
would soon be equally deprived of every 
feeling .of their nature. With such people, 
the very chance of being caught by an inspec- 
tor, for instance, in any act or state of nasti- 
ness, would make them ashamed : to prevent 
which, they would unquestionably exert them- 
selves to the utmost of their power, indepen- 
dently aim )St of coniipulsion. The nastiest 
classes of people, were all in possession of 
such feelings at one time of their lives, and 



85 



it is at that tinhe that such a police is £he 
•present will have its beit arid most perma- 
nent, effect. 

Were, however, the effects of such con- 
tagious emanations to be. exclusively confi* 
ned to these claisses of people alone, it 
would be bad enough; but when it id recol- 
lected, that every description of people, in 
whatever station of life they may be placed; 
are, from the manner in which the different 
ranks in life are allied "to each other, equaU 
ly or nearly exposed to such chances of 
b§irig infected^ the prevention or removal 
of these sources becomes a matter of the 
greatest importance to them alL 

It would appear, from Mr Howard's statA 
of prisons, that, in general, much more re- 
gularity and order prevailed in these places 
on the continent; and consequently, the 
good effects resulting fronl it were more coii-* 
dpicuoils, than in almost any of them in. our 
own country. The neatness, cleanness; in^ 
dustry, and regular conduct of the prisoners; 
with the humanity and atteritioaW the ma- 
gistrates dnd governori^, cannot be reflected' 
upon without feelings of a very different 
tiature from what we must every day expe- 
rience in other fcountries; oiir own not ex* 
cepted, where scenes of a very opposite 
i^qlplexion are daily to be met withf 



86 



In these places^ it is absolutely incumbent 
upon those who have it in thdr power ta 
command such things, to issue orders fiv 
that purpose, while they attend to see, or ap- 
point others to see, that such orders are ex- 
ecuted. Instead of this, debaucheiy and ri- 
ot are too often to be met with in these pbu- 
ces, and cleanness and regularity are only 
attended to, in proportion to the pecuniary 
resources which the prisoner may be able 
to command. WitHout the institution, 
therefore, of such regulations as I hare hint- 
ed at, justice can never be done to the 
health of those persons. 

The persons of all prisoners ought to be 
made clean on their entrance into the pri- 
son, and r^ularly preserved in that state, by 
coldbaths, &c., as long as they remain there ; 
and encouragement ought to be given to those 
who seem most attentive to this necessary 
preventative of disease. The cleanness of 
their cbthes ought to be particularly attend- 
ed to, as well as their bedding, which ought 
to be daily ^aired and beat. Stair-cases, gal- 
leries, cells, &c., ought to be regularly scra- 
ped and washed, as well as the sewers 
and drains. 

The same regulations here proposed, 
ought to be equally attended to in ships^ 
dwelling houses, &c. In ships, no place 



87 



between decks should be Matted after sun- 
set ; the births then begin to be crowded^ 
the current of air is obstructed, and the hu- 
mid vapour is to the men like a warm relax- 
ing bath of the worst sort, being replete with 
unwholesome, moist effluvia. 

In such of the above places as may have 
the air contaminated within them, it is cus-^ 
tomafy, in some coimtries, to strew the floors 
of the apartments with shoots of fir, -&c.,' 
for the purpose of purifying it ; but it is u- 
niformly granted^ that the admission of 
pure air into them, is more beneficial than 
all the shoots of fir that can be used for that 
purposfe. I think it is Dr Priestly who men- 
tions, m some of his experiments; that, in 
order that the process of vegetation may 
produce any good effect in purifying the 
air, it is necessary that such substances 
should then be growing ; for, unless their 
roots were in the ground, he did not find 
that any benefit was derived from them; 
but sometimes a very contrary effect. 

In addition, however, to the admission of 
fresh air, into tainted apartments of any de-% 
scriptioii, the rooms should be well scraped 
and washed with lime and water, during the 
act of effervescence. 

Fumigations of sulphur have advantage- 
btisly been Recommended for purifying the 

t2 



88 



apartments of the sick^ and commcm vine* 
gar^ the acetous acid, may be ranked 
among the best purifiers for substances 
that admit of being immersed in it : but it 
is not sufficiently volatile, either when c(Jd, 
or even with the aid of heat, to be employ- 
ed with advantage, in the fumigatioii of 
confined apartments. 

Where individuals are crowded and* con* 
fined together, the whole surface of the bo- 
dy should be frequently purified, by expo- 
sure to air and ablution. Mr Good ob- 
serves, that there is a laudable means of 
cleanlines made use of at the charity school 
at Yarmouth ; viz. that of sending the boys 
to bathe in the sea three times a week, dur- 
ing the summer, under the inspection of a 
master. It is strange, that this salutary 
habit should not be more universally prac- 
tised. In many parts of our island, we are 
as conveniently situated to receive any be- 
nefit that can arise from this practice ; and 
our evident neglect of this, in common with 
many other of our duties fegarding.cfeanti- 
ness, is often productive of irreparable mis- 
chief. 

It may here be remarked, that we ought 
not to sit in the room where we dine, or 
take victuals, till it be aired again. The 
temperature also of a sitting room, should 



8© 



not exceed 6CP of Fahrenheit's thermome- 
ter ; that of a bed-room may be about 50®, 
as the medityn temperature of our climate 
is between 50 and 55^ Immediately ap» 
proaching the fires^ when passing from cold 
air into a house, is highly improper. 

Water closets ought to exist in, or in the 
immediate neighbourhood of, all houses; 
there can be no excuse for the omission, 
as every house, placed in whatever situ- 
ation, can easily admit of such a conveni- 
'ehce. 

Dry and clean body and bed-linen, are 
^equally necessary to comfort, as to health, 
and we ought to avoid all uncleaned 
clothing that had been used by a sick per- 
f(on. 

- With TCgard to personal cleanliness, I 
may observe, that when the nails on the toes 
are suffered to become too long, they are 
not only uncleanly, but are apt to grow into 
the flesh, and occasion pain and lameness. 

Foulness also of the teeth imparts a foetor q{^^^ 
io the breath, which is extremely disgusting. Teeth in 
Tooth-ach, indeed, for the most part origi- 
nates from inattention to the teeth. Want, 
-however, of caution in cleaning them, is as 
great a cause of disease, as total inattention 
to them. 

f3 



90 



They ought always to be cleaned oa 
getting out of bed, before and after eveiy 
mealy and before retiring to r€;8t* The use 
of pinSy needles^ or any metallic instrument 
for cleaning .the interstices of the teeth, does 
much harm ; a quill, or a piece of wood, 
is much better. Provided they are clean- 
ed frequently, we have no use for a bard 
brush for that purpose, a soft one an^ 
swers all the purposes, while the teeth an4 
gums do not suffer from it. A tooth- brush 
made of sponge, is perhaps preferable to 
any other. ' 

Most of the substances sold for cleaning 
the teeth, are of an acid or an alkaline qua^* 
lity, which certainly may whiten them, but, 
at the same time, either destroy their ena^ 
mei, or the gums. Powdered wood char* 
coal is an excellent tooth powder. Peruvian 
bark is also very good for this purpose, but 
in some it renders the teeth yellow. Per:- 
haps then, the best kinds are plain powdeiw 
ed wood charcoal, or a piece of loaf'^bread 
completely charred and reduced to a powder, 
but, in most instances, plain-water answers 
very well. 

When yellowness of the teeth, or tartar 
adhering to them, arises from affections of 
the stomachy which often happens, we mu^ 



91 



remove the cause of It^ for topical remedies 
wiil do no permanent benefit. > 

The various afFections of the teeth^ gums^ 
&c.^ are often overlooked till they are incu- 
rable^ and an artificial set becomes necessa* 
ry. Attention to several little particulars^ 
might not only have rendered this unneces-^ 
sary^ but might have preserved them en- 
tirely free from 'disease, while those teetb 
imafiected by disease^ might have bjeen re« 
taioed in the utmost regularity of order. 

Tartar in ^me persons^ allowed to collect 
in small quantity about the roots of the 
teetfa^ at length renders them loose^ not- 
withstanding the greatest care that can o- 
therwise be taken of them. The original 
cause of thi$ ^ng too oflen overlooked| 
the disease is generally termed scurvy in the 
gums^ and treated accordingly. 

Teeth may be prevented from bteoming 
irriegular^ in their order, by properly direct- 
ing them in the direction we wish them to 
assume, by means of a ligature fastened to the 
pe^hbouring teeth j or they may be prevented 
from growing longer than those immediate- 
ly in their neigbbourhoood, by having a 
small gold cap put over them, and attache4 
to the neighbouring teeth by a ligature| 
which ought to be tightened every morning. 

F 4 



92 



A hollow tooth well cleared of all the de-' 
cayed matter, and properly washed, may, by 
imfmediately after plugging it with a piece 
of gold, be preserved for many years entire* 
ly free from disease. 

With regard to the first and second set 
^f teeth^ those of the ifirst ought to be pull- 
cd when they produce irregularity in the 
growth of the second. In the first set or 
teeth, this operation is attended with no 
pain, on account of the shortness of- their 
fangs, which are almost entirely absorbed in 
consequence of the pressure of the second 
set. Great care, however, ought to be taken 
in pulling these teeth, that no injury may 
be done to the second set, situated immediate^ 
]y beneath the back, and behind the front 
ones. 

With regard to pulling teeth in general^ 
simple as the operation may be, it is rafely 
well performed. 

To conclude this subject ; Addison, in 
No. 631 of the Spectator justly observes, 
that sieveral vices, destructive both of mind 
and body, are inconsistent with the habit of 
cleanliness. Captain Cook found, in his 
V yage round the world, that such men as 
he coulld induce to be more cleanly than 
they were disposed to be of themselves, be* 



93 



came at the $atne [time more sober, more 
orderly, and mor<e attentive to their duty. 

It must therefore be evident from these, 
as well as '/rom many other instances that 
might be adduced^ that attention to clean- 
liness, while it is conducive ta the preser- 
vation of health, has considerable influence « 
even on the preservation of the moral 
character. 



In temperate climates, the head ought to ^^^^s. 
be thinly covered, f^or indeed it need scarce- 
ly be covered at all. In very hot climates, 
however, it must be sufficiently defended 
from the dangerous effects of the vertical 
rays of the sun. 

Artificial loads of dress on the head, of 
whatever kind, must be extremely injurious. 

Light hats, of a white colour, such as 
straw, &c. are greatly preferable ; but, when 
these cannot be worn, the black hat ought 
to be, during thelieat of the day, covered 
with a piece of a white paper. 

It is of immense importance, particularly 
for those with tender eyes, to have the un- 
der side of the brim of their hat or cap lined 



v>. < 



94 



with green or blue^ particularly the* iSrst, as 
they ought, above all things to avoid white 
or any dazzling colour. 

All coverings of the neck should be loose 

and as sparing as necessity or fashion wiH 

permit ; indeed, except in particularly c^amp 

. or cold weather, we may want them eo- 

tirely. 

All tight sleeves of gowns, wrist-bandSj^ 
shirts, bracelets, &c. ought be carefully 
avoided ; they occasion swelling of the veins 
on the back of the hands^ and a numbness 
or rigidity of the joints. 

Tight garters ought to be avoided^ par- 
ticularly as they are an imnecessary piece of > 
dress^ since the purposes for which they are 
used, may be effected in other ways lesa 
hurtful to the comfort as well as to the health 
of the individual. The stockings may with 
ease be attached to the waistband. 

Perhaps no part of the body ought to be 
so well protected from cold and moisture a^ 
the feet. There is such an intimate con- 
nection between the different parts of the 
body and the feet, that attention to themi 
ought never to be overlooked. When any 
part, even the most important of the body, 
has suffered from previous disease^ cold and 
damp, applied to the feet, uniformly occa* 



95 



sions a recuri:ence pf such complaints in a 
remarkable degree* 

To prevent this, woollen stockings are cer- 
tainly preferable to any other kind pf cover- 
ing. Woollen stockings may be had suffi* 
(ciently fine« and are certainly of all others 
the best ; when silk, or any other kind of 
stockings are deemed necessary, they can be 
worn over the former without occasioning 
any disagreeable increase of bulk. Above 
all things, the feet of the stockings ought 
neither to be too tight nor too wide. The 
former cramp the feet and distort the toes; 
the latter injure the skin by their friction. 

As the protectioa of the feet against damp- 
ness has always been considered of the ut* 
'fnpst importance, whUe for this purpose, 
^)ork soles, fur lining, &c. for the shoes, and 
^ks of various kinds, have been used, a 
more simple, and, in my opinion, a more 
effectual preventive has been entirely over- 
looked. I allude to the use of cere-cloth 
slippers over the stockings. If shoes be 
worn, these may be exactly fitted to the 
foot, and not permitted to e]!(tend above 
the edge of the shoe ; if boots be worn, they 
may be of sufficient length to cover the a^- 
kle joint. Through this substance no mois- 
iure can pass, and if it should penetrate the 
shoe or the boot, it cannot reach even the 



96 



Slocking immediately covering the foot. This 
is a habit I should strenuously recommend^ 
having witnessed its beneficial efFecls in 
several instances. 

Broad pointed and sufficiently long boots 
or shoes, where the foot lies easily, are equal- 
ly neat, and much more useful, than those in 
which the foot is pinched so as to occasion 
pain. 

To those who have not the means or op- 
portunity of procuring the water-proof lea- • 
ther, I shall suggest a method of preparing 
this species of leather, at a very small ex- 
pence. — One pint of drying oil, two ounces 
of yellow wax, two ounces of spirit of tur- 
pentine, and half 'an ounce of burgundy 
pitch, should be carefully melted together 
over a slow fire. Any essential oil of better 
smell may do where turpentine is offensive. 
With this comfJosition, the new shoes, &:c. 
are rubbed, either in the sun or at some 
distance from the fire, with a sponge or soft 
brush, this operation is to be repeated as 
often as they become dry, until they be ful- 
ly saturated. In this manner, the leather 
becomes impervious to wet ; the shoes or 
boots made of it last much longer tbsn 
when made of common leather, and acquire 
such softness and pliability, that they never 
shrivel nor grow hard and inflexible. 



97 



It deserves to be remarked, that the shoes 
or boots thus prepared, ought not to be 
worn till they have become perfectly dry 
and elastic ; as, in the contrary case, the 
leather will be too soft, and wear out much 
sooner than even the common kind, with- 
out this preparation. 

Our night dress ought to be particularly 
attended to. A thick worsted night- cap is 
very improper, as forming a vapour-bath 
upon the head; the thinnest linen or cotton 
cap is fully sufficient. The shirt-collar and 
wrist-bands ought to be very loose ; and, if 
we wear la neckcloth during sleep, it must 
likewise be loose. Those who are subject 
to coldness of the feet ought also to wear 
woollen stockings ; but not those which had 
been worn during the day. 

Instead of the barbarous custom of bind- 
ing a child in a piece of cloth, so that nei- 
ther arms nor legs are allowed to move, and 
then immersing it in a very soft bed, with a 
great quantity of clothing, the child ought 
to have his extremities at perfect liberty ; 
and, from birth, to lay on soft, cooling mat- 
tresses composed of horse-hair ; over wliich 
are placed thin blankets, or a cotton qnilt, 
which cannot incommode the body. 

Animal wool, or rather cQtton cloth, pro- 
portioned in quantity to the state of the 



98 



climate in which we live^ seems preferable 
to any other covering. While it absorbs 
the perspired matter^ it preserves^ from its 
power of conducting heat being slow^ an 
equality of temperature over the surface of 
the body^ which cannot be maintained by 
any other substance ; and, on this account 
may, even in the warmest climates^ be pre- 
ferred to any other clothing. Such clothes 
are most proper in spring, autumn, and win- 
ter. Even in summer, in our variable cli- 
mate, we ought not rigidly to adhere to tMn 
cloihing, except when the weather is &vour- 
able. By too rigidly adhering to det rules 
in dress, we often stop perspiration and in- 
duce disease. 

In all large manufactories^ where constant 
exposure to great fetigue and heat are un- 
avoidable, or in our armies, when stationed 
in cold and moist climates^ the good effects 
of flannel wqpri next the skin is evident. 
Without it^ many diseases are common, 
which never appear when this expedient is 
adopted. 

The ingenuity of the ladies perhaps could 
not be b<;rtter exerted, than in contriving 
some method of preventing such havoc as 
is yearly occasioned among them from thin- 
ness of dress. Surely the fair sex may contrive 
some form of dress which may prevent bad 



99 



effects on the constitution, while at the sain6 
time their elegance of figure may not suffer 
in the smallest degree. 

Persons who clothe themselves warmly, 
or live generally in uniform temperatures, 
are affected by slight variations, which others 
of hardier habits totally disregard ; and, on 
the same principle, those parts of the body 
which are coiqmonly exposed to the irregu* 
larities of the season, are less susceptible of 
the sensations of heat and cold th&n such as 
are more protected from them . We ought, 
however, to approach the one extreme of 
dress from the other slowly and gradually. 

Dress ought not to be uncomfortable from 
its weight or tightness. All dresses of lea* 
ther, particularly when they are tight, which 
in general they are, ought carefully to be 
avoided. Indeed, any part of dress, of either 
sex, which compresses or binds any particu- 
lar part of the body, ought most assuredly 
to be avoided. 



Every living being, in ord^ to enjoy good Exercises. 
health, must breathe the fresh air several 
hours daily. 

The principal andmost useful sort of exercis-i 
es within doors are, tennis, hand-ball, dumb* 



100 



he}\, dancing, fencing, shuttle- cock^ chairi* 
ber-horse, or tremoussoin The best without 
doors are walking, bowling, riding, in wheel* 
machines, or on horse-back ; and golf should 
also be practised, if a proper field can be had 
at hand. 

The active sorts of exercise are best suit- 
ed to the young and the athletic, the passive 
are most suitable to the old ar\|d the debilitlri;- 
ed. The times best suited for taking exer- 
cise, are, in general, before eating ; and, pro* 
vided these are never carried to excess^ they 
invigorate the whole system in a remarkable 
degree. 

Regular and daily exercise ought not to 
be omitted by any class of individuals,^ partii 
cularly if their general avocations confine 
them much within doors. • In our walks, how* 
ever we ought to avoid all paths likely to^ 
excite melancholyand unpleasant sensations; 

An agreeable companion contributes much 
to serenity of mind ; but let us rather go 
alone than in dull or frivolous company, or 
with those of depraved or vitiated minds. 

The most proper and enlivening sort of 
exercise is walking, when performed, in mo- 
deration, in a pure dry air, in whatever season 
of the year. In the summer, we must avoid 
the oppressive heats of the sun ; and in win- 
ter> cold and rough weather, and always pr^- 



101 



fer the open country to the contaminated 
tit of a tbwn or city. We must avoid the 
influence of stagnant water, decaying fo- 
liage^ datnp and marshy meadows, &c. Hills 
and elevated situations ought to be prefer* 
red, where we are not in general exposed to 
^ther. 

Walking a^foDt is preferable to riding on 
horseback, and v.either of them ought at all 
times to be preferred to habitual riding in a 
close carriage. 

Riding ,on horseback is an excellent gym- 
nastic exercise, by which all the muscles are 
kept in reciprocal motion, and gentle per* 
filtration of the whole body is induced. To 
the hypochondriac, therefore, it is an ines* 
tSmable remedy. The most proper ^time for 
riding is in the morning, and one hour is in 
general quite sufficient. Riding, however, is 
not adViseable in cases of hemorrhoids, rup* 
tures, gravel, Ike. 

Riding in a carriage is not in general 
a healthy exercise^ on account of the close 
confinement, and want of that motion which 
]S necessai'y to the health of the body. If, 
hbij^ever, from weakness,^age, or other cir- 
camstances, we do use this sort of exercise, 
vre ought to keep at least one of the win- 
dows open to promote free circulation of ain 

vol.. tl# ft : 



I ^ 



J0» 



Sailing on lakes or rivers, pr short voya* 
ges at sea, are eicellent exercise for tbo 
weak, the nervous^ and hypochondriac* 

Speaking is an excellent exercise either 
for male or female, if used in moderation* 
Literary men, who have seldom leisure or 
opportunity to take sufficient exercis^^ 
ought to speak or read aloud a certain por* 
tion of each day. Singing, too, is of infi- 
nite benefit on the same principle. 

To rub the body with woollen clothes, or 
with soft brumes, is very salutary in invi- 
gorating the cutaneous vessels, and in n* 
moving partial cramps, &c« This practice 
is most to be preferred in the aged and 
infirm. 

No -exercise of any kind, if it be taken for 
beneficial efiects, ought to produce fatigue^ 
or it may be attended with contrary effects^ 
To continue any kind of exercise till a pro- 
fuse perspiration or great lassitude take 
place, cannot be wholesome. But a good 
appetite after any kind of exercise, is the 
greatest proof that it has not been carried to 
excess. 

We neither ought to begin nor finish exc- 
ercise abruptly, nor ought we to take it 
within doors, particularly in small apart-* 
ments, but in the free open air. In order 
that we may reap most benefit frwi ezer- 



103 



cise, we never oughts during it, to occupy 
our mind with any serious^ but rather with 
some light agreeable objects. Neither 
ought we to force ourselves to take ei^ercise^ 
as that i^ always improper. 

The changing of one kind of exercise for 
another^ although perhaps not different in 
di^ree^ has often very beneficial effects on 
the health. 

After having taken exercise^ we should 
not rest on a cool or a green spot, and still 
less expose ourselves to a current of air. 
A place mildly warmed by the rays of the 
tun in summer, or a moderately warm apart* 
ment in winter, so that gentle perspiration 
may not be suddenly checked, are greatly 
preferable. 

General bathing is highly beneficial, or. 
Inhere that cannot be used, washing the 
ivhole body, at least once a-d^y, should ne*- 
ver be omitted. The enlivening effects of 
this practice, where it can be used with 
safety, (for there are individual^ whp cannot 
use it,) must have been felt by most peo<- 
pie. 

After fatigue, or violent passions of the 
mind, the tepid bath is singularly refresh*^ 
ing.- When it is judged right to use the 
warm bath, the proper degree of heat, for 
young i^rsons, ought to be from 90^ to qQ""^

or 98* of Fahrenheit's thermometer, and for 
the aged about J 00*^. Warmer batbg, par- 
ticularly if they be used very often within a 
short space of time, produce debilitating e& 
fects, but, at the above temperature, they are 
invigorating. 

Count Rumford asserts, from experiment^ 
that a warm bath at 96° of Fahrenheit, in- 
stead of debilitating the system, as ha» bdeK 
asserted, invigorates the bpdy in every re* 
spect ; and he further states likewise from 
experiment, that cold air, either damp or 
dry, produces no disagreeable effects when 
applied to the body immediately after the 
warm bath has been used. 

In cold bathing, the head ought to be w€t 
first, and afterward the whole body as rapid^ 
ly as possible. The shower baik is on this 
account preferable in most instances to any 
other. The body ought to be wiped dry 
immediately after leaving either of these 
baths. 

It will be extremely difficult to give a 
preference^ either to the cold or the warm 
bath, as in different constitutions they are 
individually useful, and the contrary. The 
cold bath^ however, ought to be used with 
extreme caution in children, or rather iiv* 
fants. Indeed, the cold bath, g}'mnastic ex* 
erciseg^ bodily fatigue of every kindj^ and all 



105 



expedients to brace and invigorate the con- 
vtitution, ought only to be adopted under 
certain limitations, viz. with a proper regard 
to particular cases and circumstances, and 
these severe remedies ought not to be uni- 
versally nor indiscriminately recommended 
es means of prolonging life. 

We ought not also io persist in the use 
lof either cold or warm baths, if the body^ 
on coming out of them^ feels uncomforta- 
\Ae. 

The exercise of swimming having the 
advantage of a cold bath is very advantage- 
ous. The danger to be apprehended from 
this sort of exercise is from imprudently 

plunging into the water after the body has 
been heated, and when th^ force of the cir- 
culation is declining. 

Dancing in moderation is a good exer- 
cise ; and the room in which it is perform- 
ed ought to be cool, but without admitting 
currents of air, an4 without too much smoke 
from candles. After dancing, a change of 
linen^ aqd coffee^ or tea, ought to be taken 
before exposure to the air. I am convin- 
ced^ that inattention to these particulars 
occasions the 4eath pf many thousands, of 
young ladies in particular, who might other* 
wise have lived in good health.

hence many of them will be so completdy

The proper duration of sleep in adults Is 
^usually settled at six or seven hours; io 
children and the aged, from eight to nine 

hours. This, however, will scarcely admit 
of precise rules ; but if when we first awat^e 
our mind be chearful and active, it is the 
most certain criterion that we have slept 
sufficiently ; hvit when this is not attended 
to, a lax phlegmatic body is the consequence^ 
with a mind irresolute, indifferent toward

Various circumstances respecting the phy- cenenf 
iiical education of children contribute in a ^'^r^"^!?' 
great degree both to their strength and re- 
gularity of form, as well as to their mental 
acquirements ; such are exposure to air, 
well ventilated nurseries, in the best aired 
^aH in the house, and exposed to the cheer- 
ing rays of the sun ; regularity ahd great 
attention to bodily cleanliness ; no obstinate 
perseverance in any particular kind of 
food, which rather ought to be varied ac- 
cording to the particular effects produced 
on the child's health and spirits by it. Atten- 
tion to these, and several others, seemingly 
matters of but ordinary importance, is of the 
very greatest utility* Thus, we may see 
fine healthy children scarcely at all affected 
by the vicissitudes of climate and weather. 
All the natural changes of the body take 
place in regular and uniform order, the 
mental faculties expand by degrees, and the 
infant is not matured into manhood before 
he has completed the term of youth ; and, 
every stage being thus properly and naturaU 



114 



ly proportioned^ we contribute greatly to the 
future chance of the health and hiippiness 
of the individual. 

Artificial plans of bracing the bodies of 
children ought not to be persevered in, if the 
infant seems to have a strong and lasting 
aversion to them. 



i^g"obf^r. Upon the whole, it may be observed, that 
vatioM, too rigid an observance of those very means 
which conduce to health occasions diseases, 
and that in this way the best regulations 
m^y be perverted. If the duties or amuse- 
ments of life are pushed in one uniform 
course, habits are contracted from which it 
is dangerous to depart. He who has been 
accustomed to regular exercise, cannot re-* 
linquish it without danger; and he, who 
has always contained himself within the 
bounds of temperance and moderation, may 
suffer from the least casual deviation from 
these wholesome laws. Those in health 
ought not therefore to be strictly confined 
to rules, but inured to variety ; yet whoe«» 
ever wishes to preserve that inestimable 
blessing, a serene mind^ and a sound body, 



*1* 

must pay some general attention to his man* 
ner of life.

POLIC£ FOR DISEASES^ 



II n^ f 



Sect. Ir^PoUcefor Contagion^ InfeC'- 

tion, &c 



The late Dr Gregory judiciously says, introduc- 
*' there are so very few diseases that can ^^ 9^ 
be pronounced, in their own nature, incu-^ 
rable, that I would wish you to annex no 
other idea to the phrase, incurable disease, 
but the idea of a disease whiph you do not 
know how to cure " 

The practical part of medical science re- 
quires, from its importance, as well as from 
the conjectural state in which it stands, our 
greatest attention. But it is seldom that 



116 



we have an opportunity of witnessing im- 
provements in the practice of medicine^ 
founded on just and rational reasoning. In- 
deed, so little encouragement is given to 

such a raode of investigation, compared to 
what is obtaihed by those, Whose sole object 

it is to ingratiate themselves into the good 
graces, and work upon the failings of those 
they attend, that most men prefer the latter 
to the former. Thus, I am convinced it is^ 
that the art of pleasing, rather than of dis- 
charging duty, has often, perhaps, thrown a 
helpless family upon the mercy of a friend- 
less world, or deprived parents of a family^ 
who, had another mode of acting been adop- 
ted, might have lived many years. 

Considering, therefore, the many disas- 
trous consequences which, less or more, 
follow the death of almost every individual, 
it surprises me, that the practice of physic 
on rational principles^ comparatively an ea« 
sy task, should be thus delayed, except irt 
the iirere name, while that which hath no- 
thing but the cunning and artifice of the 
possessor to reccommend it, even while 
death in various forms may be the conse- 
quence, should be held in the highest esti- 
mation. Under these circumstances, death 
is almost never attributed to the inattention,^^ 
•r even ignorance of the physician, but to 



U7 



the inveteracy of the disease, which he con- 
trives to convince them is of a dangerous 
nature, while, at the same time, he assurea 
them of his perfect knowledge of these com- 
plaints in general, and enumerates an ama- 
zing number of the same kind, that he had 
cured on former occasions. 

It is owing to this, that, from time to 
time, the most illiterate men, by making 
themselves perfectly acquainted with the 
failings of the human character, prevail on 
mankind to believe that they possess certain 
specific remedies for the cure of every di- 
sease; and thus, even in our own island, 
matiy thousand lives are yearly sacrificed, 
solely for the emolument of professed 
quacks. 

The immense quantity of quack drugs used 
in Grreat Britain, is indeed a disgrace to our 
country, not but that many of them are good 
medicines, but that their being used indis* 
criminately for every variety of complaint, 
and in every stage of them, is a demonstra* 
tive proof of the danger that must result 
from them« 

I am sorry that similar customs, though 
perhaps not to such extent, are daily prac- 
tised by too many whose professional ac* 
complishments and general respectability re« 
quire no such disgraceful stratagems to make 

VOL. II. H 






118 



them known. For quacks are perhaps jus« 
tified in vending their drugs, when the ig- 
norant and the vulgar apply for them ; but 
it is indeed melancholy, to hear even a pro-^ 
fessor of a University, not only recommend- 
ing them in his class, but to see him, in pri- 
vate practice, loading his patients with po- 
tions of which he knows not the composi- 
tion. 

Specific remedies are indeed very low in 
the opinion of every respectable medical 
writer and practitioner, and it were well, 
when they are thus sunk in estimation, that 
the practice upon such principles were more 
completely discountenanced than it is. No 
physician, says the late Dr Gregory, has the 
comfort of thinking himself possessed of an 
infallible cure, even for the scratch oT a pin« 

With respect to the cure of diseases in 
general, I think I am warranted to observe, 
that too great ofiiciousness in prescribing a 
multitude of drugs must be, in every in- 
stance, hurtful. In this point of view, I 
have no hesitation in asserting, that medicinal 
do more harm than good. An immense 
multitude of drugs are often prescribed by 
practitioners, that are at least useless, if not 
hurtful, arising, for the most part, from our 
want of knowledge of the mode of action of 
these substances. We have but an impei^ 



"9 



feet kddwledge of this, even in hiany of oirr 
best medicines^ which is the reason that we 
employ tKem often with so little advantage ; 
and it is owing to the same reason; that we 
jpmploy such a great variety of useless medi- 
cines, which can be of no service^ and must 
uniformly oppress and destroy the digestive 
organs. In short, I have no hesitation in 
assertingj that either the habitual, or eveii 
occasibhal lise of medicines, before we have 
fiuled in effecting our purpose by simpler 
means ; viz., exercise, diet, clothing, &c. is 
hever.adviseable, and very frequently must 
be attended with the most dangerous con<^ 
sequences; 

t 1 should even \^ish that those medicines^ 
upon whose peculiar action we can calculate 
with considerable certainty, were as sparing- 
ly as possible used in practice; and; instead 
of attempting, by the mere for(:e of such 
medicines, to drive away a disease^ our at- 
tention ought to be directed, in a grea^t meai 
siire^ to other points which, in practice, sire 
tod often deemed unimportant. The medi* 
eal attendant, who can remove his patient^s 
tlisease vHth the smallest quantity of medi- 
cines, particularly if they be of an active na* 
ture, is acting in the greatest conformity to 
jfchose duties which he owes to the public^ 
|tnd in obedience to those rules which every 



120 



candid atid honourable man ought to make 
his greatest boast. The very dangerous 
custom of prescribing fresh budgets of me- 
dicines at every visit, is too evident, and no 
person who will consider for a moment, can 
be deceived by such a practice. On the 
part of the medical attendant, it is taking 
advantage of that confidence which the pub- 
lic has been pleased to place in him^ and 
which ought not to be abused. I should 
imagine, that the physician cannot do his 
patient a greater favour, than to remove his 
disease entirely without medicines, ahd 
merely by properly directing his attention 
to the regulation of situation^ clothing, exer^ 
cise, diet, &c. ; and, while there remains a 
probability of removing it by these means^ 
to reserve the exhibition of medicines of a 
tnofe active nature, till these have evidently 
fkiled in their desired effect. Although^ 
from the mischievous oificiousness of the 
opposite plan, assisted by consultations, vi» 
sits, &CC., the disease may suffer partial aU 
leviation, yet this is only changing one form 
of complaint for another, perhaps more per* 
manent in its nature, and probably mor% 
dangerous in its consequences, than the ori* 
gmal one. It, frc m these immense Idaxli 
of driigs, the whole digestive s}^9tenn^ 
and pcrliapb that of otlier lunctions of the 



131 



body, ere, for the reipaind^r of life, which 
often happens, rendered totally unfit to per- 
form their healthy actions, although the ori-^ 
ginal complaint be removed, what benefit 
has the patient derived from such 4 change ? 
To prevent, in a great measure, deleterious 
^psequences, no medical attendant, when 
]be prescribes for a well informed, sensible 
per^H) ought exclusively to have any secret 
connected with hi§ profession* If he be re- 
(quired to deliver his opinions respecting any 
points it ought to be done openly and can^- 
4idly» even from the most trifling to the 
IPQ^t important consideration, connected 
with the preservation of his patient's health, 
or the removal of his disease. If it be urged, 
jth^t it is neither customary, nor perhaps 
pru4ent» to explain many circumstances coa- 
liected with his profession, then it may just^ 
ly be suspected tliat there is a radical error, 
not in the profession, but in the head of him 
;wbo pretends to practise it. By such per- 
sons, when opinions are extorted from them, 
they are couched in those dark technical 
terms, said to be proper to the profession ; 
and medicines are given, biit upon the same 
principle, neither their natyre, nor the ef- 
fects expected from them, can be explained* 
Thus, he- who has courage to be used in 
this way, has his common ^ense daily in- 

u 3 



ia2 



suited, and his health at last irrecoverably 
destroyed^ and all this under that affectied 
grimace and pomposity of manners, whicbj 
from experience, have been too long found 
to be more useful to themselves than bene- 
ficial to their employers. Thus, with their 
multitudes of bottles^ pills and powders^ for 
reducing top vigorous an action of the 
system, and the numerous list of tonics 
almost immediately after, to brace the sys- 
tem, they form a sort of laboratory of the 
human stomach, and the persecuted patient 
is thus alternately braced and reduced^ till 
he is either tired of such unmeaning' and 
inexplicable proceedings, or falls under the 
effect of t)ie disease, or, what is still more 
probable, under the effect of the drugs giveii 
to relieve it ; possibly, indeed, by the mini* 
culous strength of his constitution, a patient 
may sometimes withstand these formidable 
assaults* 

There is, perhaps, no profession in which 
innovations are with greater difficulty made 
than in the medical one. ^he grossest 
faults, and the most erroneous doctrines, of- 
ten acquire a degree of respectability fix)m 
their antiquity aloqe, and people involunta^> 
rily reverence opinions which have nothing 
else to recornmend them than their anti- 
iquity. It is owing to this, that improvc- 
|nents in our profession are at all timet 



123 



dow^ and even many have been laid aside as 
entirely useless, without their merits having 
undergone that fair and candid examination^ 
.3¥hich, from various circumstances, wehav;e 
jeason to believe them to possess. The a- 
version which physicians have always had to 
Step asiide from the beaten path of practice, 
Jbias indeed been long notorious^ i^ conse- 
iquence of which, the effects of almost all 
x>ur valuable medicines are either psirtially 
known, or not known at all. The late at- 
tempt to introduce into practice the Pneu* 
matic medicine^j has not met with that 
great approbation to which it is evidently 
jentitled, which is too often the fate of rar 
Jional proposals, or attempts to improve the 
practical part of our profession, while any 
thing of a n^ysterious or unaccountable na*- 
ture, meets with a host pf supporter^. 
]Bnough.has certainly been ascertained, re- 
^pectiqg the powers of these medicines, to 
iconvince any one, who is not bound in the 
fetters of prejudice, that among them, there 
are some, which, under proper management;^ 
^xnay prove very important a^ldijtioi^s to our . 
JNiIateria Mediica. 

Pr Beddoes ai^d others, upon this subject,

^pinions, and are assuredly entitled to thf

well to the progress of our art. Indeed^ I 
am of opinion, that, at some future period, 
it will be found that from the properly re- 
gulated use of pneumatic medicines, our 
principal advantages in practice will be de- 
rived. 

The mechanical and chemical philoso- 
phers, I may observe, have in their turn 
contended, that the cure of diseases should 
be conducted in conformity with the parti- 
cular opinions of their respective sects. Like 
almost every doctrine, each of these have 
been pursued with a vigour by their adherents 
and supporters, which, from want of due 
consideration, even of their own principle^ 
did not answer either their own expectation^ 
or that of the world in general. Instead^ 
therefore, of that perseverance and steadi- 
ness which is necessary for the developement 
of every important truth, hasty opinions were 
formed, often by guess, in support of it, or 
alluring fabrications which never could be 
realized but in the heated imagination of 
their original proposer. Thus, both these 
principles have been supported, perhaps, in 
many points unjustly, and many valuable 
truths, individually contiected with them, 
have been entirely overlooked, when mat- 
ters have engaged the attention, which, 
comparatively speaking, were of very little 



115 



moment. It is this pursuit of opinion, in 
preference to facts, that has been the great- 
est obstruction to improvement in medical 
practice. 

The prosecution of experiments^ when 
they seem conducted on rational principles^ 
with a candid detail of their results, is the 
surest way by which we can arrive at truth 
in any science. The cruelty and unmean* 
ing butchery, however^ which is daily foU 
lowed under the name of experiments^ when 
-perhaps, the performer can scarcely tell 
you the ob|ect he has in view^ or how it can 
be applied to any useful purpose^ can 
rnily obtain for him that abhorrence which 
bis senseless cruelty so justly merits. 

Those modes also of ascertaining the com- 
parative medical properties of substances, re> 
commended in the works of many of our best 
medical writers, by exposing to their influ- 
ence pieces of animal flesh in ditFerent states 
of preservation, seem to me of a very doubtful 
nature. It is not by exposure of a wounded 
surface, even in a living state, to the action 
of these medicines, that we are to know 
its effects when taken into the animal 
bi>dy ; far less when such animal substance 
is separated, and thus divested of that vital 
principle which regulates the action of every 



126 



substance which may be applied to the liv- 
ing body. 

In directing our attention to air sensibly 
infected by putrid exhalations^ we must 
know, that it cannot lose one of these pro- 
perties without becoming $i new body, e^ 
ther by decomposition or new combination, 
and thus to destroy the danger :• — I say, 
to destroy, not to mask; two things 
which it is unhappily customary to con* 
found. But they are very different in the 
estimation of the chemist, who sees» in od* 
our . disguised, only a confused mixture, of 
which the parts have a constant tendency 
to separation ; whereas, the destruction of 
the odour is the result of a combination by 
which the odorous body is decomposed, or 
combined with a base which changes its 
properties ; thus, in neutral salts, the mq^t 
.corrosive agent remains inert, until it be 
disengaged by new affinities. 

We know, by fatal experience, that both 
animal and vegetable matters, when in a 
state of putrefaction, are the sourpes of 
the most formidable maladies^ from the 
mildest fever to. the plague itself. Sir J. 
Fringle has furnished us with an instance 
pf a prison or an hospital fever caused by 
the infection pf a gangrened membey;. 
yenice experienced a terrible fever, occs^ 



127 



sioned by a quantity of putrid fish ; and the 
town of Delft in Holland suffered a similar 
evil from putrescent cabbage and other ve- 
getables. Other examples might be quoted 
of countries almost depopulated by similar 
catises. 



When we have ascertained the air to be '^^^^^^ 

rrevcnting 

in a vitiated state^ and thereby rendered ca« orDestroy. 
pable of propagating disease, our first object ^|ion,in^ 
ought to be, to remove the cause of such vi- fcction,fltc 
tiation ; and afterward, or at the same time, 
to investigate the most effectual remedy, and 
to bring it in contact with those corpuscles 
which propagate the contagion, for the pur- 
pose of destroying in the air, and wherever 
it may deposit itself, the composition which 
exercises this destructive property. 

What, says the chemical physician, is, 
that which constitutes the curative virtue, 
that physical action of medicines, whic^ 
physicians have with reason called occult, 
since they could only judge of it from expe- 
riment and observation, unless it be a change 
of combinations produced by affinities? in 
|he very extensive scale of medical agents^ 



128 



from the slight alterative to the most power- 
ful corrosive, this circumstance alone de- 
notes all the degrees, and explains all the 
differences : proofs of this have been placed 
in the clearest light by chemists of the first 
abilities in different countries. 

These notions are evidently incorrect, be* 
cause vital bodies are by no means influen- 
ced like inanimate substances. 

It appears, from a variety of authorities of 
the utmost respectability, that seclusion from 
places where epidemieal diseases rage, pro- 
vided those places are well ventilated, almost 
certainly prevents the disease from affecting 
them, such as colleges, ^c. but if this secloh 
zion is made in an ilUaired part of a town, 
or in short in a situation in any way confii^ 
ed, it produces a directly opposite e^ct. 

Sea air affords a certain asylviip in all hot 
and unhealthy countries ; and, in the most 
malignant diseases, the immediate removal 
of the patient to a purer air is often the oi>- 
ly method to preserve life. Indeed, the won- 
derful eiiect that this has, when properly ap- 
plied, in every stage of disease, is amaxin^. 

Supplies of the purest air, are, however, 
insufEicient to destroy contagion ; of' which 
I could produce several undeniable proofs 
from- the best authority. It is necessary, 
therefore, to correct^ by some active mean^^ 



139 



the notious effluvia which arise from dis- 
eased bodies, afflicted perhaps with morti- 
fications, carious bones, malignant ulcers, 
or putrid fevers. 

It is commonly said, that fire i^ a univer- 
sal purifier, and this familiar observation ig 
true in one sense: the substances which 
have undergone its action, preserve neither 
the same form, nor the same properties ; but 
ideas, either inaccurate, or absolutely false, 
are often attached to it. 

It IS) on the other hand supposed, that 
combustion is equivalent to destruction, 
while in effect, it only changes pre-existing 
combinations by new ones,- and sometimes 
it forms compound substances of those that 
are simple, which, in reality, is rather to 
ptxKluce than to destroy. 

Pure oxygen air is confined to the pur- 
pose of exciting the powers of suspended 
animation, and it is, therefore, to be admi- 
nistered to children born apparently dead or 
overlaid ; to persons suffocated by drown- 
ilfig, by steam of charcoal, by foul air, Arc, 
TThenever the circumstances of the case, 
ttiay indicate the possibility of recovery. 

Dr Crawford, however, is of opinion, 
^ that the fluids which destroy fetid odours 
taost speedily, are those which are acknow- 
ledged to contain the greater portion of 



130 



oxygen, and that it is therefore extremely 
probable that this change depends on the 
union of the oxygen with animal hepatic 
gas, or some one of its constituent parts.** 
Opinions and' enquiries of this nature are of 
the utmost importance to the preservation 
of life, for, as respiration is one of the prin- 
cipal functions upon which it depends, it is 
probable that^ by ascertaining the changes 
produced in the air, expired in different 
states- of the body, after its havingbeenpla« 
ced in different relations, with respect to di- 
et and drink, we may be led to a tnore ra- 
tional employment of our internal^ as well as 
our external remedies. 

Very ingenious, experiments have been 
instituted, to prove the efficacy of fixed air 
thrown into the blood, in preserving animals 
from putrefaction. These, however^ seem 
to me still more doubtful than the experi- 
ments of many ingenious authors, to prove 
the effects of diseases, thought to be of a 
putrefactive nature, by expolsing pieces of 
dead animal matter to the influence of those 
gases disengaged during the process of pu« 
trefaction. Were the conclusions drawn 
from these experiments just, every substance 
containing a given quantity of fixed air^ 
would be equally t fficacious in removing} 
putrid disea^s : hence peasy apples^ cabba*f 



131 



ges, turrrips, ought all to be preferable to 
bark. 

We have reason, therefore, to suspect 
that there hie other princifdes in bodies be- 
sides their fixed air, which contribute, per- 
haps, more than the air itself, to render them 
antiseptic. This supposition seems to be 
supported by some of the experiments of 
Sir J. Pringle, and particularly by that one 
where two grains of camphor, proved a 
much stronger antiseptic than,, sixty grains 
of sea salt, and camphor, according to Dr 
Hales, contains almost no fixed air. 

Resinous substances, even those which 
give out a volatile acid on distillation, in 
whatever manner they are employed, only 
mask, for a moment, the contagious odour, 
without purifying the air, and without de- 
stroying the contagious corpuscles. 

No advantage can be expected from throw- 
ing different substances on live coals. Ei- 
ther pure or aromatic vinegar thus employ- 
ed, is rather burnt than evaporated. In such 
eases, the vinegar is in a great measure de- 
stroyed, and the mr retains only the impres- 
sion of the giases resulting from its combus- 
tion. Nitric acid itself gives only unrespirable 
gases, after having served, by its oxygen, to 
augment the intensity of the fire. Similar 
effects result from the employment of gun* 



132 



powder, the explosion of which merely ez^ 
erts a mechanical action on the air. 

Dr Priestly found, that all kinds of nosj- 
OU8 airs were restored by continued agita* 
tion in a trough of water, the noxious efflu- 
via being imbibed by the water. Thus, 
warm or cold water employed in ablution^ 
may tend to carry off the contagious matters, 
and disperse them, so as sensibly to diminish 
their fastor, in the same manner that it wea* 
kens any solution by diluting it ; but what 
it leaves, as well as what it carries away, is 
not decomposed, and has only changed its 
vehicle. 

Various other methods have been attempt-* 
ed and proposed by ingenious and industri« 
ous men for the destruction of those gases 
whose presence vitiated the atmosphere 9 
and by the inspiration of which, or by other- 
wise applying them to the body, life was, 
according to their particular nature^ en-^ 
dahgered. 

By passing a current of air cpnttnuaUy 
through the sick room, the pestilential air 
may be swept away. By removing the bed« 
clothes and linen of the patient, the matter 
of contagion accumulated in them may also 
be removed. But this cannot be done eve* 
ry moment ; yet the matter of contagion is 
formed every moment. Here, then, is the 



133 



essential ageiKiy of mineraiactd gaMs. They 
do meet the matter of contagion every 
moment^ and destroy it^ as sdon as it is 
ibrmed;

should the riieana necessary to perform thw 
process be wanting ; or, in short, should the 
danger not be so alarming as to enjoin 
those extraordinary precautions, it may, io 
such cases, be used as a preservative. 

It is unfortunate, that in the investigation 
f of the powers of any remedy, external, as 

V well as internal, so many circumstances 
.should exist to give a wrong direction 
■to the mind. The anxiety of some per- 

\ Bons, the ignorance of others, the desire of 
feme, the love of interest, and the fear of dan- 
* gerous innovations, have alternately operated 
, against or in favour of the administration of 
P our best remedies for the alleviation of dis- 
C *rders incident to the human body. In the 

V conflict of such opposite powers, it is diiB- 
t to separate truth from exaggeration and 

jrror. The activity of many of the airs, for 
p instance, has been urged against their use. 
f That some of them possess powerful and 
J active properties, can, however, be no ohjec- 
l-tion to their use ; for the same may be said 
^ of opium, and certain preparations of anti*- 
kmony and mercury, which are daily pre- 
I jcribed, and which only do mischief in the 
F hands of unqualified persons. These airs, 

like all other medicines, may be overdosed ; 

but practitioners who are acquainted wUh 

their effects, will take care that they are 



13S 



not too. freily, br too frequeritly, applted; 
With' *ich precautiolhs^ thfey may be pro- 
nounced to be as safe a3 most other diedU 
eine^. 

In but few instances^ however, Will the 
application of these airs do any more thail 
remove the effect produced by them.. We 
therefore must search for 6ther remedies 
niore Effectual in their nature which will, id 
addition to them, destroy the sources of 
these diseases, for cdntagioti being constant-^ 
ly generated, requires to be as constantly 
destroyed; rendering the perpetual process of 
destruction niscessary, though perhaps in-^ 
4^ectiial^ unless our attention be directed to 
the original sources of theifi; 

The mineral acids possess the power of 
destroying contagious miasmatay and the 
putrid smell which indicates their presences 
These acids may be converted into a state 
of vapour, so as to purify a mass of infect^ 
ed air ; in shorty with a few simple precau4 
lions, they may be diffused in places shut 
up, and where people are present^ without 
producing the slightest inconvenience. 

• The three mineral acidsl are in general re-> 
gatded as the most powerful instruments 
in destroying of every organic composi^

The soipharic acki^ diffbised m three 
parts of w-ater, tn^tantfy dcslrojrs sll odour 
in the mass of air with which 'it comes 
into contact; and there can be no donbl 
that thic ^olphoreoiis acid itself, en^Iojed 
in a licpAd f tate, wodd- prodooe the aaaqe 
effect.. 

Ilie sulphoric^ add cannot, however, on 
account of its fixitjr, serve to porify the air i 
the- sulphureous acid has scarcelj any effect 
in that way ; and the nitrous acid aicis only 
on the respirabte portion of the attnosfdierf^ 
while die Tapours exhaled from it are highly 
soffbcating. 

The nitric acid disengaged, accordii^ to 
the process of Eh' Smith, most certainly de* 
stroys putrid miasmata, but it cannot' be 
diffused to a great distance, is readily conk 
densed, and only acts as an oxygenant by 
giving out nitrous gas ; a frequent repetition 
of the process is likewise necessary to in* 
sore its success, even in a small apartment. 

The muriatic acid i^xists wholly in -a state 
of gas, the volatility of which is augmented 
in proportion to the quantity of oxygen unit^ 
ed with it ; whilst, on the contrary, the ni- 
tric acid loses its smell, and becomes more 
fixed, even in a high temperaturey in prcH 
portion bk its acidifiable base approaches 
toward a state of complete saturation.

j[|ttenGe to bring it into immediate contrct 
with the substances upon whicii we wish t6 
produce a change. . It may be performed 
:vl^th less risk of fire than that of Dr Smith's^ 
since no greater heat is necessary than what 
is produced from the mixture of the ingre^ 
dients. This process^ . therefore^ is fiimpife^- 
dndeasy df execution, even to the individuals: 
least accustomed to such operationsi It 
requires neither extraordinary apparatus^ tlor

In fumigating with this acid^ all the ap^ 
paratus necessary^ is nearly equal fdtrUi of 
common salt and sulphuric add^ (oil: of yi^ 
triol of commerce,) and a large glass goblet. 
If the room be small, the goblet maiy be 
placed about the middle of it, on the ground 
or on a t^ble. The acid and salt must be 
gradually added to each other, whenever thq, 
vapours produced by their mixture cease ip 
a^end. If the apartment be smalii it' witf 
Ije.. unijieces^ary to move the goblet froiu 
place to place ; but if, on the contrary, it be

coming into contact with the faeAid or wb- 
lignant miasmata^ will destroy it without 
producing any inconvenience to the person^ 
present. The doors and windows of the 
fumigated apartments should then be close- 
ly shut for several hours. 

The muriatic acid was first recommended 
and used by Dr James Johnston of Wor- 
cester, in 17^d, but it was Mr Morveau 
who first shewed that it neutralises mias* 
mata, and by that means destroys their bad 
effects. 

By adding, during the operation, a small 
quantity of the oxyd of manganese, the oxy- 
gei^ated muriatic acid is procured, .which 
may be regarded as the most certain proier- 
yajtive from contagion, and which is itill 
further recommended by the ease with whidi 
it may be applied in all cases. 

The following proportions have been 
found to approach as near as possible to the 
point of saturation.

process is carried on in uninhabited cham«

with sick. 

With respect to acids in general^ they 
may be serviceable, in removing infection^ 
either because they destroy the combination, 
as is probably done by the oxygenated mu<- 
riatic acid^ and perhaps by the nitric and^ 
aalphureous acids, or by simply coQibining 
with the putrid substance. It is thus that 
the muriatic acid appears to act ; but it must 
not be concluded from this, that the sub* 
stance is an sijkali^ £br the alkalies have idso 
the property of combining with it, imd, at 
least, lessening its effects. Antiseptics pre-* 
vent them, by producing a combination with 
animal substances, which offers more resis- 
tance to the causes of decomposition.

of vapour, carried by respiration into the na-..

and the Remedies for these diseases are im- 
mediately, and too often, when too latCj,

the causes of his complaint.

nated, and thus render it again fit for the

purposes of respiration, and all thojie advan-^ 
tages which we derive from it in a pure state 
in the economy df human life. 

A general rule, during the epidemical 
season, either before or after the patient has 
been affected by it, is to remove him as 
soon as possible to a more wholesome at« 
mosphere. To wait in expectation of re- 
lief from some accidental occurrence, which 
may never arrive, is, in every l;ind of disease, 
extremely imprudent.

The plague is a very widely spreading di-r 
•ease. The greatest mortality that it has 
occasioned in later ages^ was about the mid* 
die of the fourteenth century, when it seiz* 
ed country after country for five years toge- 
ther. In the year 1346, it raged in £gypt^ 
Turkey, Greece, Syria, and the East Indies; 
in 1347^ some ships from the Levant oar-' 
ried it to Sicily, Pisa, Genoa, &c ; in 1348, 
it got into Savoy, Provence, Dauphiny, Ga- 
talpnia, and Castile, &c ; in 134p it seized 
England, Scotland^ Ireland, and Flfipdera ; 
and the next year, Germany, Hungary, and 
Denmark : and in all places where it came, 
it made spch destruction, that it is said to 
have depopulated the earth of more thaQ 
half its inhabitants. 

That some kinds of weather may be more 
favourable than others, for the expurgation 
of infected goods, is very probable ; but jt 
remains to be determined by experience, 
whether, in a pestilential constitution of 
the air, the same goods require much longer 
time than usual, to be divested of their coii« 
tagious property ? 



143 



. When the south-east wind blows, or the 
weather is moist and rainy, it is observed 
that the infection in goods, though they be 
exposed to the air, is rather fomented than 
dissipated, so that the complete quarantine 
sometimes may be performed, and the goods 
remain not purified. An inconvenience 
may also be apprehended in the winter, 
which does not usually happen in the sum* 
mer, namely, that in cold weather, or when 
the north wind blows, the pestilential mias* 
Biata are concentrated^ and lurk in the 
clothes and other goods, till set loose by the 
return of heat, when they cause terrible de« 
vastation. But, whatever the weather may 
be, if the fumigation be properly applied to 
the goods, and moreover, the change of ap« 
parel, and washing with vinegar^ be properly 
managed with respect to persons, the qua* 
rantine will be a sure method of ascertain- 
ing whether the person has brought the in- 
fection along with him, and also of purifying 
him, if infected. 

Great debility marks this disease through- 
out. It commences with febrile symptoms, 
but they are not of long continuance. 
Headacb, giddiness and delirium, often ap- 
pear very eariy, and are worst during the. 
febrile exacerbations; the last of these often 
alternates with coma, which, when it ap-». 



144 



pears early, is a bad symptom. Loss of 
speech, or faltering or tremor of the tongue^ 
then exists and also often continue for 
months after the patient's recovery* The 
sense of hearing, too» is impaired. .The eyes* 
have an expression of muddiness, blended 
with lustre, but during the febrile exacerba* 
tion they become red, which gives a wildnesst 
to the looks ; in the remissions they assume 
their former muddy appearance* Whei): 
this disappears, it is a favourable symptom. 
The tongue often retains its healthy appe9« 
ranee, and sometimes it becomes white and 
moist ; at other times, parched with a yel* 
low streak on each side. In general, the 
pulse is low, quick and equal, sometime% 
fluttering or intermittent. In bad cases, it 
is always low, except during the exacerba* 
tions, when it becomes full and. strong, til^. 
at length, even during that period, it be«- 
comes only quicker and extremely feeble* 
Except in the exacerbations, and tf(;lv{|nce(f 
stages of the disease, respiration is seU 
dom disordered. Oppression is felt about 
the prcecordia, wbich^ when it appears earn 
ly, is a bad symptom^ the patien( also eooou;

cope, particularly when the patient is erect, 
and trembling of the hands, startings and 
convulsive mdtidhs of tbeJimbs, are not un- 
€ommont. Where the skin is constantly dry, 
the- danger is great; but frequent and gentle w 

perspiration, seem to tnoderate the disease* 
' Vomiting is a dangerous symptom, at any 
period of the disease, but nausea is of more 
fiieifuent occurrence* Looseness is itkemse 
^ dangerous symptom, but costiveness seems 
to produce no bad effect. At last, buboes 
and' carbuncles frequently appear over the 
body^ with hemorrhagies and colliquative 
diarrhsea. > 

* The plague, in common Mrith other epi-^ 
demic distempers, has its several stages. 
These stages, however, vary in difi'erent 
years. From the accounts given by authors 
on the same subject, who have lived at very 
distant periods from each other, it is found 
that the plague gradually disappears, becom* 
ing milder in its symptoms, and assuming 
the more gentle form of fever. 
' In its mode of attack, .however, it seems 
ta possess peculiarities not common to ma« 
ny of our febrile complaints. The plague, 
ibr instance, begins at some point, and gra- 
dually apreads itself; bulj in many other of 
our Mmh com^daints, numbers of the inba- 



146 



bitants in distant streets are at once seized 
by them. 

It has not been determined whether this 
be communicated by actual contact^ or 
through the medium of the air. We find 
good authorities for both sides of the ques^; 
tion ; but the names of Prosper Alpinus, 
Forestus^ Schreiber^ Pringle^ Smith, Scc^ 
who are of the last opinion, would probably 
make one hesitating upon the subject, in- 
cline toward it. 

Various absurd, and many very judicious 
opinions, . have been formed by authors re« 
specting this disease and its cure* Fires 
seem to have been at one time the princi- 
pal remedy for it. In the most favourable 
circumstances, the use of these seems to have! 
been doubtful, and, in many instances they 
were evidently hurtful. Some physicians, as 
a subordinate consideration^ recommended 
that sweet' scented herbs and flowers, toge- 
ther with ointments of the finest flavour 
should be thrown into the fires ; but if any 
advantages resulted from this, it was from 
these last substances, and not from the fireff 
themselves. 

Par6 tells us, that ^* Alexander Benedictusy 
a Scythian physician, made the plague aris^ 
ing from infection of the air to cease, by 
causing all the dogs, cats^ and such likif 



147 



beasts which were in the city^ to he killed^

¥tfr poisons have not only an antipathy with 
their antidotes, but also with some other poi- 
BfMsJ* These, however, with universal fires, 
and firing of great guns, seem to me very use- 
less in destroying contagion. The fires, in 
particular, may probably have a very oppo- 
site efiect ; and, I have no doubt that this 
practice has been a great cause of virulence 
in plague, when it otherwise might have be- 
come inild^ and even ceased altogether for 
tfafit perioif at least. For it is very evident, 
that they must have produced a consumption 
and a destruction of that' principle in the 
air, which is equally tj;ie food of animal life 
and of fire* 

During a plague at Marseilles, this prac- 
tice was so obstinately persevered in, that 
the atmosphere became obscured with a 
thick smoke, which encreasied the natural 
heat of the season and climate, and appeared 
to give additional activity to the contagion. 
Cells, moreover^ contaminated with the 
plague; have not in the slightest degree been

burned in them. 

The explosion of gun-powder displaces^ 
but does not diestroy, the odorous particles^ 
by putting in motion the air which dissolves 
them. It may, in a cerfaun«cfegree, cxpA 
them from a confined space ; fattt^ in the 
open air, it can only weakeh their impress 
mon, by diluting them in a greater quatatity 
of the aerial fluid; 

The custom of shutting up houses in which 
the plague existed^ must h^ie been attends 
ed with most dreadful Coosequences ; in^ 
deed this seems to be the opinion of aH mo* 
dern authors. 

The numerous improvements which have

During inflammatory complainls, in ha- curc of 
bits not remarkjably reduced, the most spar-f Jj^^*™"^*' 
ing diet should be used ; among which 
fruits of various kinds, and prepared in dif- 
ferent ways, may be included. For drink, 
the juice of ripe fruit, barley-water, or toast 
and water, are highly proper. 

When the hardness of the pulse has abat- 
ed, this regimen may be relaxed, and more 

£ 2 



>52 



nourishing materials^ though 4tiH with the 
utmost caution, may be indulged in. 

While inflammation is most common ip 
the robust, we can treat it with fireedomi la 
the delicate, however, it is more dangerous, 
and it runs its progress most rapidly, while 
we are pf evented from pushing our remedies, 
or from repeating, them. 

Cutaneous inflammation, such as pimples 
on the face^ though not dangerous, are of- 
ten extremely disagreeable, and may often: 
be removed by a weak solution of corrosive 
sublimate in alcohol ; but wheii they exist, 
which often happens in both sexes, frota 
some constitutional affection, external ap- 
plications have no permanent efiect in re- 
moving them, and are often attended with 
dangerous consequences. They, however, 

may almost always be removed by other 
means. 

In every case of inflammation our first 
object. is, if possible, to terminate it by reso- 
lution. When this fails, and the affec- 
tion is external, our next object is to termi- 
nate it by suppuration. 

The first consideration in the cure of in- 
flammation is, where it can be detected^ to 
remove its cause, which in many instances 
is alone sufficient to accomplish a complete 
cure.

tion, we are in general to be regobted bj: 
the state of the pulse, ydt it is not alwayslto 
be depended on, as, ' in some states of kin 
flammation, a small pulse is often rendeml 
fuller by repeated bleedings. . - \^ 

When, from various, circumstances, . we 
find it necessary to bleed sparingly, we ought 
to bleed as near the affected part as.posai-* 
ble, so that the greatest effect may be pro- 
duced by the least loss of blood. .,;. • .

When gangrene, originates from loss^of 
tone of the parts, or of the system in gene^ 
ral, stimulating medicines, such as barkf fcc. 
ought to be used ; but it the inflammation 
be violent, such medicines can only do 
harm.

In those, however, debilitated by age, enfee^

pfe^ious bleeding must almost always be a^

wh^n thus once induced, it can, I may ven^

may sometimes be obtained, but this is aU 
ways deceitful, and of very short duration. 

The physician therefore cannot be too 
careful in discriminating, with great caution, 
the habit of body, previous manner of living, 
and other circumstances of patients who 
may be afFecled with inflammatory com^ 
plaints, before employing venesection, even 
altbotugh several symptoms indicate the pro* 
piety of such practice. If the habit of bo<-

OUy and saccharine matters are service^ 
able ; by besmearing the fauces, they abate 
that tickling and irritation about the glottis^' 
which excites fVequent ooughhig, withcut 
espectoration. For this purpose alsb^ iii 
some cases, an addition of opiitm to these

tage, and if the extract of liquoriee, muci^

batement of the cough, opium may be eni^ 
ployed advantageously, even during the 
most inflammatory state of the disease-; care 
being taken to keep the bowels lax at' the

and makes the cough less frequent, and this 
diminishes the power of one cause of aggra-

When pneumonia seizes the patient, if

The remedy chiefiy to be depended on is 
bleeding at the arm^ in extent suited to the

disease. It may in general becontimied 
till syncope be produced. This, if fieces* 
sary, may be repeated ia a few hours, and

a good bleeding ; but sometimes four oi- fiver 
pounds may -be taken in a few daytf. When

If sweats ia this-dise^^e beypartidi aiKl 
clammy^ with great difficulty oC breathingj 
we ought not to encourage thcfm. : 

In Feripneumony, the antiphlc^istic treaty 
ment ought to be attended to, and extertuil 
heat and cold are equally to be guar^i^d 
agiiinst. Living, thereibce^ in a close ill ^trr 
ed room is exceedingly incommodiously and 
contributes much to retar4:;the cure^Qf-pe* 
ripneumony. The teo^per^tvse of the ^ |ia- 
tient's rooiii^ indeed, odgbt never to exge^ 
from 50 to 60 of Fahrenh^t'a scale* : 

Purging ought to be used with the greats 
est caution in this diseaife, as it debilitalM 
the patient too much. By the too frte.use 
of laxatives, particularly latcf in this disenae^ 
we often bring on a disurbeBa, during which 
the expectoration ceases^ and the patient 
dies. Bleeding at the commencement. of 
the disease, is almost always beneficm^i 
we are sometimes even obliged to rer 
peat this oftener than once. . From t^a 
to sixteen ounces of bloqd taken at 
once, is a good bleeding. Syncopy^ induk 
ced by bleeding, or by the patient being put 
in an upright posture, is likewise beneficial; 
and we ought, as early as possible, to eoH 
ploy the antiphlogistic regimen. Weough^ 
however, to relax our bleeding, as well as 



l67 



the antiphlogistic regimen, when the dir 
sease occurs in very 6\d people. 

The pulse in peripneumony is, evei^ from 
the beginning of the^disi^^^e, . oppressed, ir- 
regularly and sluggish, and the patient at the 
same tune complains of weakness. This 
atat^ often emUarrases the young physician^ 
bat when the disease has been of short du- 
r^tion^ even in this state of the pulse, if there 
e&ists a fullness at the breast, with difficulty 
of . breathing, &c., the bleeding will often 
have, the effect of strengthening the pulse, 
an4 relieving every ^ynyptpm of oppression. 
We ought, however,: to. proceed in the ab- 
straction of blood, under such circumrtan- 
ces, .with grea( caution.; ^ Blood-letting may. 
then be used, provided the catarrhal and. 
pneumonic symptoms are severe, but when 
these are slight, or effusion is to be feared, 
a repetition of blood-letting will do harm. 

Bleeding is hurtful, whi^n deferred till late 
in the disease, and evea although the pulse, 
&c., should indicate the necessity of this 
practice in peripneumonic affections, when 
the tongue has become black, the breath 
offensive, with very high coloured, or black- 
ish rank urine, with black ^pots on the bo- 
dy, and black, bloody, offensive stools, 
it is seldom, if ever, attended with suc- 
cess. The pulse immediately sinks and be-

This disease^ when it' origkiates from he- 
moptysis, is more frequently riecovered Groin 
than when cttosed by tubercles. But, '^' to 
suppose /• says Dr Beddoes, ^ the ulcerated 
or confirmed stage of- pulmonary cot^sump* 
lion, even in rare instances, curable, is to 
estimate remediable power very highly ; and 
to expect such an event often to occur, is to 
betray inadequate regard to the generally 

irreparable nature of the malady/* 

In persons of a .phthisical habit, the 
slightest symptoms of it ought tD be strictly 
attended to. 

Removal to a warm climate m the earty 
stage is of great use. ' An island, with no 
high hills in it^ at a distance fitim fikMm- 
tainous countries, where snow may be col- 
lected, and at a heat from* 6o^ to 90^, is* a 
vei^ favourable situatibn on account of the 
equality of temperature which must {>revail 
in it. : . . 

The temperature of the indivrdUftl aptfrt- 
-ment in which ^diisumptive patients !i^, 
ought to be subject to ve^y little tehange, 
perhaps from &5 to 68 or 70" is thie m<^ 
suitable. 

With the exception of exercise, indeed^ 
Dr Beddoes seems to think, that a heated 
apartment, from dO to 70 of Fahrenheit's 
scale, is as beneficial as removal of the pa« 



If I 



tient to a warm climate. This^ in ccH^unc- 
tjon with tincture of digitalis, in doses, with 
th€ generality oif patients, from iO to 20 
drops, twice or thrice aday, arrested the 
progress of the symptoms in various instan- 
ces. The regulation* of temperature, and 
auxiliary means, seem both necessary; as ma* 
ny, who by attention to medicines alone re- 
cover in a great rneasure, have a recun^ence 
of the symptoms on the accession of cold 
weather. , ' 

The efFecta of temperature, as well as the 
inhalation of gaseous subtances, have indi- 
vidually had theiir advocates in the cure of 
ptiknohary consumption. Dr Beddoefs gives 
many instances of the most marked advdti- 
tage from attention to these particulars 
alone, among which he addtiee^ casds, where 
confining the patient in a cdw-house, or inf 
the neighbourhood of these animals, wad 
the principal treatment, and where by too 
early removal from these places all the symp- 
toms recurred. 

I have little hesitation in observing, that the 
inhaling of various gases may be of the very 
greatest advantage in the cureof many diseas- 
es ; they are certainly far preferable to the 
too commonly adopted plan of loading the 
patient's stomach by a multitude, of hurtful, 
or at best useless drugs. Strict attention to 

L 4 



m 



the effects of these difl^rwt «ub&t9i|f«ni^ 
both in health and disi^fse, would certaiqiy 
remove much of the doubt upoa tb«W 
sul^jects which at present perplex us* 

Dr Beddoes found, that confinement in t 
cow-house^ even after the exhibition of din 
gi talis, picuta. opium, hyociamus, &e, b«d 
failed in relieving the symptoms, prpdficed 
the most marked advantage. Still, how-v 
ever, in i^ome cases, hQ deemed it proppr t^ 
employ one or more of these medipiM% 
with the occasional use of acids dmipg iiie 
confinement in the cow-house. The only 
beneficial afi^ects attending this inhalation of 
the atmosphere gf a cow-house, Dr 3a44ow 
conceives to be from its immediate e^^t 
on the ulcerated lungs. From this it would 
appear, that evep he ha^ no great fiiith m 
this application in the tubercular stllg^ 
He, however, thinka, that the present t^ 
cows is not absolutely necesstiry, as the g^-* 
ses proper for the purpose idly be formed 
from various materials without the cow^ b^ 
ing present 

All e)^erpises of gestation, where little bcN 
dily exertion is made, are most useful m 
phthisis, particularly in those subject to he-t 
moptysis. The least fatiguing exercise 
must be prescribed to the feeblest, and

iftg, blistering will remove it ; and when the 
superficial irritation odcasioned by blisters is 
inefiectual, we may sometimes derive ad- 
vantage from issues in the breast. 

** Digitalis/' Dr Beddoes observes, <* in 
carefully regulated doses, that is, so admi- 
nistered as not to induce sickness orlan- 
gour, very regularly increase the momen- 
tum of the blood," Thus he reckons it a 
stimulant to a certain extent. ^* I have 
known digitalis/* he says, *^ occasion an in- 
creasjB of the pulse from 76 to 120, with heat 
of skin and headlafeh." . -. . . 

When digitalis had evidently failed in re- 
moving the symptoms of phthisis pulmona- 
lis, the best effects were produced when 
there was given along with it opium^ calo- 
mel, bitters, fcc. The soporific power of 
this medicine in tincture, diluted by water, 
or in powder, has been, in many instances^, 
to the full, as remarkable xis that of opium. 
Dr Beddoes even thinks that digitalis in-r 
creases the organic action of the contractile 
fibre, as much, or more, than opium ; 
but that it does not so much, or so imme- 
diately, increase the organic action of the 
nerves. 

Tincture i« the best form in which digi- 
talis ought to be administered. In subr 
stance, infusion, &c. it creates nausea, an^ 



is apt to beedMs cathartic'j or to prove. d?u- 
retic^ which aire states during consumption' 
equally to b^' guarded against. 

^A child' qf five yeitre old may in general 
take fivie drops bf the tincture, a tea spoon- 
ful of the ihfijision, or the decoetiotr, or a 
quarter of d graift (>f the powder thrice a- 
day in water. Adults' maycjomlncnce witlv 
teti- drops of the tincture, a table spoonful of 
the decioction or the infusion, or one grftin 
of the powder for a dose. . 

When the sputa in phthisis becomes 
black, fetid, or putrid, we can only over- 
icotne this tenfdcricy by the moat abtive treat* 
roent, which mudt be persevered in or dis- 
fcontintied' according to its effects on the ge- 
neral habit ; and in these advanced stages 
of this complaint, the inhalation of the 
fumes of acids,' ^he muriatic for instance, 
may be employed with at least as great 
chance of success as any other remedy with 
^hich we are a<x]uainted. 

PemulceBt$ will relieve the cougn, but 
they load and oppress the stomach by their 
oleaginous and mucilaginous quality. The 
*mfilk of different animals has, on this prin- 
•ciplef, been administered in phthisfs, with, 
it has been thought, apparent^ advar^tage.

They increase th$ sweating, but th^ easci

the Head, j^^ pj^^^ j^ ^j^g ^j^jjj,^ health,, even indeed 

previous to any sufficiently m^u^ke^ derange- 
ment taking place in it -to excite our alarm. 

It is in the early period of the disease 
when remedies can be applied with the 
greatest advantage, and I am sorry to say 
that, in too many cases, nothing at this im- 
portant period is done, except the ildmini- 
stration of the most trifling and insipid sub* 
stances that can be thought of. But still 
worse than this, substances are daily employ- 
ed which assuredly do harm. , 

In order to effect the cure of any disease^ 
it is of course first necessary to know its na- 
ture, and the particular qualities lOf the sub- 
stances we employ, and to administer them 
as soon as possible. This is particularly ne^ 
cessary with the disease under consideration ; 
for by not understanding its nature, or defer- 
ring remedies to the last, we not only prevent 
the good effects which might have been deriv- 
ed from the early application of proper reme- 
dies, and unnecessarily add to the infantas 
sufferings, but preclude the possibility of 
success. 

It is a good general rule, in the treatment 
of this complaint, to apply an extensive blis-

Jj^ ^dsjtitionto the cap blista-/th§n, I have 
frequently found |t necessary tipt only to ap* 
ply leeches to the temples ; but even to open 
the jugular- vein before the pulse diminished 
in force and frequency)- or- the general in- 
flammatory symptoms of the system ceased. 

I have found it absolutely necessary, in 
consequence of Ihe' recurrence ot the syriip^, 
loms. to repeat the application of the blistec 
over the head from J 2 to li6 tmfies ; and iA 
the hitervals, there was so great a propensity 
in the head to fall to one side, that I have 
bieh obligeci to alt^tacli laces all round it, 
which were fixed to the cap fey the one end, 
and to the body-jclothes at the other^ to 
prevept it from falling in these directions. 
lEven such patients, however, by the above 
treatnientj have recovered completely. 

I am aware, that blistering the head in 
such complaints has long been a favourite 
reniedy among physicians ; but for the most 
part, conceiving this a last remedy, they de*

Cure of Anasarca is the most cureable species of 
this disease. Hydrothorax and ascites are 
less so ; but nearly the same method of core 
with respect to internal remedies^ seems to 
$uit every species of dropsy. 

Our principal objects in the cure of drop^ 
iy, is to remove the causes of the diseasei 
duch as intemperance, &c. to evacuate the 
serous fluid, and restore the lost tone of the 
system, Indeed^ without removing the first 
cause, the evacuation of the fluid tends only 
to hasten the dissolution of the patient. 

Tonic medicines may therefore be used 
during the whole course of the disease^ and 
especially after the fluid has been evacuated. 
The tomes most useful^ are the chalybeiites^

Feravian bark, and the various bitters which

Sometimes the quantity of water thus 
drawn from a dropsical person is^ immense 
as to weigh mote than thb body df the pa- 

^ Evaeufttionof the water in hydtotborax 
and ascites, and afterward bracing the in- 
feebled system, is perhaps the most rational 
method of cure. 

When the water is in cysts, we are often 
disappointed in our attempts to draw it off 
by the trocar. Incysted dropsy is therefore 
seldom, if indeed ever, cured. 

In the commencement of anasarca, ban- 
daging, friction, and moderate exercise, a^e 
often of the greatest advantage. : In ban* 
da^ng anasarcous limbs, it Qug|itAalway s to 
be doqe before getting out of bed, and the 
compression ought never to be greater on 
the upper than on the lower part of the limb. 
We should also avoid all tight ligatures, 
garters for instance, about the legs of drop* 
sical persons. Friction in^anasarcous limbs 
is more effectual in the morning than in the 
evening after they have swelled. This should 
be done from below upward, and not alter- 
nately upward and downward. ' The hand, 
ii piece of flannel, or the flesh*brush, answer 

this puipose most conveniently. '

tion. Want of experience, or want of patience 
to watch its effects, often fiE^ls of success ; 
but this failure, as might be expected, is 
rarely attributed to its true cause^ which re^ts 
entirely with the physician, but to the in- 
efficacy or dangerous nature of the medi- 
cine itself. 

To such gentlemen as are in the habit of 
expressing such opinions, either privately^ 
or in their class-rooms, I have only to ob- 
serve, that I shall engage to cure at 
least 96 in' 100 of uncombined oases, and^ 
that such cures shall continue for the re-* 
mainder of the lives of the patients, unless 
similar causes to what first induced the disi* 
ease cause a recurrence of iL This is a test

jcases, the administration of this medicine^

efficacious, requires the nicest discrimina-^ 
tion, and the greatest attention, which ex<- 
perience and patient attention alone can be-^

The rules for the ado^inistration of thiK 
medicine, are as follow s 

Istf Twenty drops of the tincture of caa-p 
tharides, (according to the London pharauu 
copeia), m^y be taken in a glass of water 
thrice a- day, and the dose gradually iqcreasr 
ed.till some degree of uneasiness ia felt in 
passing water, when it mu3t be diminished ; 
or, if the sensation be severe, the ndedicine 
is to be entirely left off, till this sensation 
abates, when it is again to be had recourse 
to in doses aufEciently great similarly to af- 
fect the system. This may be known by 
the increased force and frequency of the 
pulse, as well as by the symptom abpve al- 
luded to. If the difficulty in passing water 
become suddenly troublesome^ clothes dipt 
in warm water, and applied to the belly an4 
between the thighs, will assist in relieving 
it. At such a time, also^ a, smart dose of 
my kind of piu-gatiye medicine may be ta^ 
ken. 
2(1, If paip, or even une^iness, a(; sto- 



fliach be predoced l^ the tihcturjei a smaU, 
tea capful of an infuaion of camomile flow* 
erSf taken along with «adi dose^ will re* 
lieveit. 

ddy If die. appetite be unimpaired^ nour 
rishing 60up6, plain roast or boiled oieat, 
fowl or fish^ with v^etables, simply dressed^ 
jare the most proper kind of food^ with one, 
*two, or even three, glasses of wine after 
dinner. For common drink, I should re- 
commend soda-water^ or simple toast and 

water. 

4th, No degree of cold, if the air be dry, 
can do the slightest harm; Cold lavation, 
or even cold bathing, may, if in other re- 
spects agreeable, be used with the greatest 
advantage. Moderate es^ercise on foot, or 
in a carriage, is e^^treqnely proper ; but 
when the effect of the tincture has become 
troublesome, it will be necessary to refrain 
from every species of exercise, and to re* 
cline much pn a sofa. 

Persons predisposed to glandular swellings 
cannot use the cantharides but with the ut- 
most caution. Danger may even arise 
from the use of thi3 medicine under these 
circumstances, but this must greatly depend 
pn the situation of the enlarged glands. 

3y those^ too, af{^cted with pain in the 

2^4

dhest, dry, hard, or teazihg cough, the can*: 
diarides must not be used, or only with the 
very greatest caution, and under the inspeo-^ 
tion of one accustomed to prescribe it. 
Regulated thus we may insiire its aal^itary 
effects, without incurring the risk of t|iote 
pernicious ones which attend daring igiipr«'

Fever. Consumptions and fevers, we see by arith-* 

y~r metical demonstration, are amongst the 
tion and most universal and fatal maladies of our 
ncM. ^' island. We, with uncommon alacrity, 
issue orders for vessels to be put under 
quarantine, even if they are supposed to 
contain diseases which we have reason to 
believe can scarcely exist in our dimate, 
and yet we thus tapiely allow diseases to ex- 
ist among ourselves, and be propagated^ 
without half the attention being paid them 
which is wasted on the others. 

• ■ 

The medical attendant can do littlfs more 
than attempt to remove this or any other 
disease, when it has been actually formed, 
and represent the effects of such complaints 



Md 



•n society, that the legislators of the coun« 
try tnay cause the proper measures to be 
adopted for their prevention. If these mea- 
sureS; which so loudly call for legal inter- 
ference, are still overlooked, we know well 
who ought Co be blamed; and, in such 
omissions, we only see a part of that system 
of neglect which, to the disgrace of our ru-> 
lers, has too long existed in almost every 
thing that relates to the preservation of the 
health and lives of individuals, — the medical 
police of the countty. 

The local causes of fever, as well as the 
police for them, I have already pointed out, 
and must not now dwell upon the subject. 

The patient, in this disease^ ought either to 
removed firom the infected air^. or the cor- 
rupted air should be corrected^ and frequent 
changes of bed and body-linen ought to be 
observed. Constant and free ventilation^ 
therefore^ during fever, is absolutely neces- 
sary. 

In fever, indeed, no cordial is so refresh- 
ing as cool fresh air; the patient's bed- 
chamber ought therefore to be kept as pure 
as possible, and he ought not, as too often 
has been the case, to be stifled in his own 
putrid atmosphere by well meaning but in-* 
judicious attendants. Besides ventilating^ 



jgo 

it is often also necessary to correct the bad 
air of the sick room. This may be done by 
sprinkling vinegar in it^ or by diffiiMDg 
through it the steams of nitrous or oximuri- 
aticacid. 

Although, therefore, fresh air may per<» 
haps have no great efiect in destroying .fe^ 
brile contagion, yet it certainly dilutes and 
renders it in a great measure inert ; it there** 
fore ought always to constitute part of oar 
means of cure in fever. In every stage of 
this disease, then, though the patient should 
breathe no other infection but that of his 
own atmosphere, it will be necessary to keep 
the curtains of the bed open, and use ali 
other means to procure free ventilation. 

In every stage of fever, also, cleanlinesa 
must be attended to ; clean linen may be 
used at all times, being very agreeable, and 
often the means of procuring a quiet and 
refreshing sleep. The lineq, however, re^ 
moved from the sick should be instantly 
immersed in a tub of cold water, rinsed out 
and hung up till nearly dry, and then fumift 
gated before it is taken from the wash- 
house. This may be done with vinegar, 
nitrous, sulphuric, or muriatic acid, by which 
the noxious particles become mert and in- 
pocent, or are destroyed. Washing thq 



IQI 



mrallSy also^ witb )ime dissolved in water^ has 
been long practised for the purpose of de- 
oomposing the effluvia^ but this quality of it 
bas been called in question by Mr Morveau^ 
y»ho gives some experiments to prove that 
air^ in which infectibiis efHuvia exists, is 
not at all purified by agitating it with lime 
water. The practice^ however, of washing 
tbe walls of houses containing sick persons, 
18 very useful in keeping them clean ; and 
this, with ventilation in slight, or even in 
pretty severe cases, is found to be highly 
beneficial. I hitve often observed, that by 
these measures alone, or by ^lereIy remove 
iQg the patient from foul ill-aired houses to 
a pure cool air, the symptoms of the disease 
JO a very few hours abated in violence, and 
even without the use of medicines tlie pa^ 
tjent became perfectly well* 

When fumigations, which are universally 
allowed to be of the greatest benefit in fe« 
vers, are adopted, from that moment the 
progress of the fever seems arrested in that 
place, as none are afterwards in general 
seized, or if so, it is in a very mild degree. 

In typhus, in particular, not only ventila* 
tion is to be observed, but there ought to be 
fio fire in the ^p^rtment, no curtains on the 



193 



bed^ and as little furniture in the room as 
possible. 

The particular treatment in fevers^ as in 
many other disorders, must greatly depend 
on the season of the year, and the fconstitu* 
tion and manner of living of the patient. 
Brin^ Water^ as a drink in fevers, may be U8ec| 
with the utmost propriety if the patient de- 
sires it ; if it be deemed too insipid^ we may 
dissolve it in currant jelly, or a variety of 
syrups ; or apples sliced and roasted, tama- 
rinds, sage, balm, or toasted loaf-bread^ &C5 
may be infused in it^ A little beef^tea^ a)* 
tso barley-water, or gruel, answers well. 

Patients in febrile complaints become 
sooner disgusted with sweet or aromatic 
drinks than by the use of barley-water, or 
water-gruel, acidulated with lenion juice, and 
a small proportion of wipe. Small beer or 
butter milk are generally very grateful tq 
them, and any qf them are preferable to wa- 
ter alone. 

Acids are extremely proper in fever, but 
ascescent food produces flatulence, and im- 
pedes digestion. Farinaceous vegetables, 
such as peaches, &c. are useful ; and roast- 
ed or boiled apples are good articles of food 
in fevers, but are less nourishing than farina- 
ceous vegetables. All acescent fruits are ren- 



193 



dered less u), aAd kre more nourishing, when 
lyriied or baked than otherwise. Boiled ap- 
ples are preferable to raw ones, and may be 
taken with advantage in every period of fe- 
ver. 

However high a fever may be, the sick, if 
ibey desire it^ may be nourished with weak 
soups, animal jellies, simple vegetables, &c. - 
with the greatest propriety. 

During perspiration, or sweating, by what- 
ever means, induced, the drink must be 
warm, except in those debilitating sweats 
wluch reduce the strength without yielding 
rdief. 

We are greatly indebted to the late Dr AppUca. 
Carrie of Liverpool for the accurate obser- ^q^^ 
vations he has made on the effects of cold Watcf. 
water in fevers. It is used in the form of 
affusion, immersion, by bathing the body 
with a sponge, &c. 

It would appear that the cold, applied to 
the body in fever, is always most evidently 
beneficial early in the disease, before g?Skt 
and permanent debility is produced ; if us- 
ed after this, some warm wine, or any si- 
milar cordial, ought to be taken immediate- 
ly after. 

The most proper period for the affusion of 
cold water, is immediately when the hot 



194 



stage is completely formed ; bot we must be 
careful that the cold stage be completely 
over. When this is used, as soon as the 
hot stage is completely formed, [it often eo« 
tirely arrests the progress of the fever ; but 
if this be delayed till the thihlor fourth'day^ 
although such a termination is not to be ex- 
pected, this practice will greatly moderate 
the symptoms, and probably shorten the dia* 
ease. In advanced stages^ however, when 
the patient is much debilitated, tqiid- vine- 
gar and water is of greater benefit than the 
cold affusion ; and the coniinoance of the 
cold affusion, when the patient is convafes- 
cent, is often injurious. At any time, ap- 
plied in too great a degree, it brings on diar* 
rhsea. 

The immediate effects of cold affusion are 
diminution of heat ; the pulse becomes less 
frequent, and gentle perspiratiops, followed 
by sleep, are induced. As the affusion of 
cold water is a formidable operation ; and 
as the frequent application of it by a sponge 
is attended with many inconveniences, I 
have 'for several years past reaped all the 
good effects of either of these applications, 
by the application of a large bladder full of 
water applied over the region of the stomach. 
Indeed the decided advantage of this mode 



19^ 



«f Bp^y\ng cold is so conspicuous, that I 
fiHotifld mi JB^ihe it fiitfy adequate to answei^ 
ieverjr pWpose, without the inconvenience 
Attending the other modes of application. 
' Thei dr^dfui efFects occasioned by the 
a^id^tidn of* the cold affusion during the 
^Id stage^ mcist deter every one froav the 
use of it at that period. ^^ Even when the 
hidat i^ Ititiollmderable^ as is often tbecai^ein 
the laift stages of fever, it' is improper to use 
it. Wiitetf from 75 io 87 degrees is then 

Water at the temperature of 40, or from 
that to 60 degrees, is pa-haps prefferable to 
'cold water ; but I have used it greatly below 
t^is temperature with signal advantage. 
Witter saturated with salt, a proportion of 
vinegar Bdded to it, or salt water itself, are 
«11 preferable to fresh water. In fevers^ the 
burning heat in the palms and soles of the 
feet is also greatly relieved by moistening 
them with vinegar and water ; and shaving 
the hedd, and applying cloths dipt in cold 
waterj are often extremely refreshing. 

The tlitemal use of cold water acts, though 
' less powi^uUy,' exactly ^milarly to the ex- 
itemal application of it, and must be used 
with the same cautions. 

The tepid affusion^ immersion^ internal 



196 



use of warm water^ &c. difFer from the cold, 
88 it cannot, without the utmost impropriety^ 
be used when the temperature of the body is 
high^ which is the time when the cold oan 
be used with the greatest advantage ;- but is 
chiefly serviceable when the tempecAtorefaw 
&llen low, at which period the use of the 
cold is highly improper. j. 

Dr Currie asserts, that the affosion of te^ 
pid water lowers the heat of the body tnore 
rapidly than even cold water ; but its e^fiecli 
are less permanent, as he never saw it 'stop 
the progress of fever. 
Heat. External heat, or exertions by which the 
heat of the body may be encreased, are to be 
avoided, such as straining the body or speaks 
ing loud or long. Aliment and drink, too, 
which produce the least irritation, and give, 
the least stimulus, must be preferred, and vio** 
lent emotions of the mind must be avoidcA 
Kind, humane attention^ and a fm>spect of 
complete recovery, on the same principle 
ought to be held up to every patient in fe^ 
ver. 

In typhus, we must not diminish the tem- 
perature of the body below the healthy de* 
gree. Indeed, heat, continued for a great 
length of time, in all fevers induces GOathr#* 
tiesstf 



197 



Medicines which gently promote persptra- Perspira- 
tion without producing inflammatory action 
or irritation in the system, may be used in 
fevers with advantage. Nauseating doj^es . . 
of emetics, such as preparations of antimony, 
may be employed in preference to ipecacu- 
anha for the purpose of inducing perspira- 
tion in continued fevers. Neutral salts also 
.promote perspiration in a slight degree. The 
aqua ammonia acetatae, (the spiritus minder- 
eri) is perhaps the best in#thfs respect 

By inducing a gentle and generally diffus- 
ed perspiration in continued fevers, we sel- 
dom fail of affording relief ; but when this 
is excited by violent heat or highly stimula- 
ting medicines, it is partial and clammy, or 
although general, if profuse, and not attends 
cd by relief, it is at least useless, if not hurt- 
ful, being in general caused by extreme de- 
Ijiility, and ought therefore to be stopped 
without delay by the administration of pro- 
perly stimulating medicines to invigorate 
the system* ^ 

During persjiiration, it seems at least im- 
proper to use the cold Water in any form. 
Perspiration itself is a cooling process, and, 
if the body be not artificially, heated, suffici- 
ently answers the purpose of itself. 

In fevers, no evacuations, particularly ^vacu*. 
blood-letting, (which we are not warranted ^^**

to use, unless when strong inflammatory 
symptoms exist, which did not yield to re- 
frigt^rant remedies, and repeated purging,) 
unless the disease has arisen from previous 
neglect of this last, ought to be made suflS- 
ciently great to increase that state of debili- 
ty which must necessarily follow the disease. 
Jn febrile complaints, purging can only be 
useful in evacuating the overloaded bowels^ 
but beyond this it must be hurtful^ as tend- 
ing to induce debility. 

Costiveness, which frequently prevails.in 
the beginning of fevers, is best removed by 
a mild glyster in preference to cathartic 
medicines. In typhus, delirium will often 
arise from costiveness, which being remov- 
ed, will entirely disappear. 

Spontaneous or artificial vomiting early in 
the disease usually cuts short its progress ; 
but when employed after debility has adv^n^ 
ced, it is always hurtful. 

Emetics, composed of tartarized antimo- 
ny, or ipecacuanha, particularly when given 
early in fevers, usually check their pro- 
gress ; most probably by the violent shock 
the system sustains from them, by which the 
dernnged functions assume their natural 
state of action. 

Emetics early in the disease remove the 
almost constant nausiea universally com- 



l»9 



plained of, while at the same time they in« 
duce gentle perspiration, which is often 
greatly refreshing. 

' As an emietic, mq^y be used three grains of 
taftarized antimony, and fourteen grains of / 
Ipecacuanha. 

- The most favourable time for the exhibit 
tion of emetics is in the time of accessions, 
or when the greatest degree of ease is ex- 
perienced by the patient, which is mostly 
about noon, or in the evening. 
/ £meti€s ought never to be given in fever 
Yvhen the face is flushed ; we ought rather to 
appily leeches to the temples, and, when the 
flushing has gone, we may then with pro* 
priety^ if necessary, employ emetics. 

If» however, the first exhibition of anerne-* 
tic has little good effect, it is seldom that a 
repetition of them fails to do harm, by ex<* 
bausting or by purging the patient. 

If the headach be not removed by an eme- , 
tic given early in the disease, a blister ap-* 
plied over the head is an almost certain re-o 
niedy. . 

When fevers seem long protracted, Wis* Blisters. 
ters applied to the head, breast &c, seem to 
be attended with beneficial efltects. Sina^ 
pisms are even preferable to blisters. 

Blisters in fever, when the headach is se^ 
ivene, aeldofi fails in relieving it. 

n2 



300 



In bad cases of typhus, however, there 10* 
a great disposition to gangrene, on which 
accoutit blisters ought not to be used ; but 
in milder cases they may probably be used 
with advantage ; but even this seems to be 
doubted among authors. When applied at 
an improper time, there is covering the blis- 
tered part a dark thick tough matter hke 
leather, but when ruddy, specks appear on it 
this symptom is favourable. 

Stimulants ^^ ^^^ advanced stages of fever, when dc* 
bility prevails, stimulants, such as wine^ 
bark, &c. may be very usefully employed ; 
but before this they are probably hurtful. 

W here in fevers the powers of life fail, or 
where the temperature falls below the heal* 
thy degree, we must raise it by artificial 
means. During languor^ therefore, and ex* 
cessive lowness, a little wine may with pro« 
priety be taken. On the appearance, alsOp 
of petechias in typhus, we must abandon the 
antiphlogistic regimen, and adopt plans to 
invigorate the system. . 

Wine may be given in fever when the 
puise is soft and frequent, with general de- 
bility, particularly if the patient feels a de- 
sire for something to support his strength. 
The doses may, in general, on siicb occa- 
i sions, be pretty large, but much must de- 

^ pend on the urgency of the symptoms^ and 



r 



201 



the former habits of the patient. Under the 
abo^e circumatances, wine is greatly prefer- 
able, to bark, or any other substance, as it 
« fjests on the stomach when nothing else 
;wil|4' Some farinaceous substance added to 
_ it, if ^reeable to the stomach, assists its 
nutritive qualities. 

When wine is not to be had, ardent spi- 
:rits, diluted with water, and sweetened with 
•iigar^ has, in many instances, as good an 
effect as wine ; and, among a certain class 
of people, it is preferred to it. Spirits, how- 
ever, ought never to be used, unless when 
:wine cannot be procured. Fermented li* 
-^uors, such as porter, &c. are far preferable 
•Co spirits. Those even in health who in- . , 
-dulge in fermented liquors, are much more 
lusty and vigorous than those who use much 
.spirits, who are in general lean, and often 
- paralytic. 

In certain states, however, of debility in 
fevers, although it is extremely difficult to 
induce a state of intoxication, it ought at all 
times during them tp be strictly avoided. 

Where there is a disposition to gangrene 

in fever, bark, when it rests on the stomach, 

is perhaps preferable to wine ; but both con- 

• joined are to be preferred to either alone. 

Bark, acidulated with sulphuric, or any other 

acid, makes it rest on the stomach ; when 

N 3 



002 



without it, the bark would be vomited. As 
bark, however, will not stop continued fever, 
it 18 scarcely ever necessary to gire it early 
in that disease ; but, latter in the disease, it 
obviates symptoms of debility, and shortens 
the complaint. 

During fever, opium may be given, pitv 
vided the skin is soft, and when the tetnpe- 
rature during the exacerbation is not great ; 
but where the skin is patched, and the h^t 
great, the use of opium mu^t be declined. 

In that kind of typhus, also, where the 

m 

delirium is considerable, without partaking 
of coma, opium is a powerful medicine in 
removing tlie delirium, diminishing the fre» 
queiicy, and increasing the force of the 
pulse. Wine, in similar instances, may per- 
haps be preferred, as being at least as per- 
manent in its effects ; but, in some patients, 
a sufficient quantity of wine to produce be- 
neficial effects cannot be administered, and 
then opium becomes a medicine of the ve* 
ry greatest value. It is alone by running 
into opposite extremes, either in the abuse or 
in the almost complete neglect of this medi- 
cine, that its effects in such fevers are im- 
perfectl) understood. 

Camphor in fever often has a very consi- 
den-iMt efftct in overcoiMing restlessness and 
anxiety^ and does not interlcre with the ex- 



ftos 



hibitiota of other medicines: When conrir 
bined with opium^ it often checks obstinate 
trotniting^ which sometimes occurs in fever. 
Saline draughts given in a state of efferves- 
cence also allay this symptom. 

When the appetite returns, panada, riceJ, 
or sago, may, with the greatest advantage, 
he added to the wine ; but these, or any 
other kind of food^ must be used in small 
-ijuantity at a time, till the digestive powers 
gradually assume their wonted vigour. Pa- 
tients, indeed, never incline to eat much in 
fever ; they may therefore be allowed to take 
what they choose, as they never will take a 
auf&cient quantity of any thing that can do 
them harm. I may also observe, that while 
the patient is in his senses, his own inclina- 
tion will best determine whether be should 
sit up CT be in bed. 



In jail fevers, as in other contagions, we Cure of 
ought, where it is possible, to remove its ^^^^ ^*^^^* 
causes, and our next object is to correct or 
destroy it when formed. 

Oneway of preventing contagion in jails, 
&c. is to make the bedsteads of iron instead 
of wood, in which last substance it often 
lurks for a long time. 

The beds, also, of all patients who die of 



204 

jail fever ought, before again being used, to 
be properly fumigated^ washed, and aired. 

In jail fever, our first general object ought 
to be to remove the prisoners into the other 
apartments, to wash them clean with warm 
or coM water, to fumigate their clothes with 
sulphuric acid and nitre ; to enlarge the 
apartments, and form openings near the 
cieling to admit of a free circulation of air. 

Ill this disease, in common with other 
febrile complaints, fresh supplies of pure air 
are absolutely necessary, not only for the 
comfort of the sick, but absolutely for the 
removal of the disease. Washing the body, 
too, and frequent changes of dean lineOj are 
absolutely necessary. 

Oar best remedies in jail fever, when the 
disease has somewhat advanced, are such as 
moderate the symptoms of the fever, with- 
out dimihishing the strength; and those 
which support the strength, without increas- 
intr the heat of the body, or the frequency 
of the pulse. For this purpose, some anti- 
moTiial medicines, and likewise vitriolic 
ether, are individually very proper. The va* 
puur also arising from nitre, decomposed by 
vitriolic acid, or the oxygenated muriatic 
av id formerly mentioned, are highly proper 
for destroyin'^ iontagi<>ii of every kind, 

Aciduiaied dm kb are extremely proper 
during the whole course of the disease. 



^ao5 

Thfere can be no doubt of the utility of 
' the cold bath in jail fever ; we have many 
instances of its having proved highly bene- 
ficial even in the very worst and most ad- 
vanced cases. One case at present occurs 
to my recollection, related by Mr Howard, 
of a prisoner |n one of the jails which he vi- 
sited, who was apparently dead, but, on be- 
ing brought out to the court, wh^re the well 
w^s pumped upon him, he, to the aroaze- 

. ment of every one present, recovered. Mr 
Howard says he has seen several instances 

. of the same kind. 

Dr Currie says, that in hospitals, manu* 

'factories, and prisons — situations in which 
the low contagious fever so frequently ori- 
ginates, the practice I have mentioned (cold 
affusion, immersion, &c.) may be followed 

.with great ease, safety and advantage; but 

. it is in a more particular degree applicable 
to this contagion when it appears on ship- 
board, becsiuse in that situation the useful 
means of prevention or cure are necessarily 
limited) and the eminence of the danger re- 
quires a remedy that operates with speed as 

, well as efficacy. The waters of the ocean 

. afi^rd this remedy : in every point of view, a 
most happy one for mariners, since it can 

. be . applied almost as easily as it can be pro- 
cured. 



006 



Delirium in jail fever is seldom, if ever, 
relieved either l?y leeches or blisters, but coM 
embrocations, or shaving the head, are often 
useful. This fever and others which re- 
semble it, seldom admit of bleeding. Even 
although symptoms should indicate the pro- 
priety of blood-letting, this practice ought 
to be adopted with the very greatest caution, 
as, in almost every instance, it ia injurioos. 

Sweating in this disease ought to be used 
early, but not persevered in, unless an abate- 
ment of the symptoms follows. 

Purging more than is absolutely neces^ 
sary merely to evacuate the intestines, is 
highly injurious in jail fever, as it is often 
followed by colliquative diarrhsea, and some- 
times even by gangrene of the intestinet. 
When there is a tendency to purging, which 
sometimes happens, absorbents and opiates, 
with small doses of ipecacuanha and rhu- 
barb are extremely proper, but then antimo- 
nial medicines and acids, whether vegetable 
or mineral, must be avoided. 

When the stomach in this fever is irrita- 
ble, a pill composed of calomel and opium is 
extremely useful, as it allays the irritation, 
'and in a shorter or longer time occasions 
evacuation of the bowels. 

From this disease being most cotnnKm 
among the lower orders of the people, whose 



ao; 



rteHnachs may perhaps be overloaded by 
coarse food, we ought at first to prescribe a 
vomit to empty them. JEven about the se- 
venth or eighth day, when the tongue be* 
comes dry and foul/ a gentle vomit of ipe- 
cac^uanha reridtjrs it clean. Vomits, how- 
ever, ought to be used early in the disease, 
and never when the contagion has excited 
vomiting, and rendered the stomach irrita- 
ble. Late in the disease vomits ought to be 
used with great caution. Tartar emetic 
ieems a preferable substance for vomiting ; 
a grain every quarter of an hour till it pro- 
duces its effects, is, for an adult, a sufficient 
dose. 

Blisters are sometimes serviceable in jail 
fever, when there is inflammatory action of 
the brain. If, however, .they are used, it 
must be early in the disease, but they ought 
in all stages of it to be used with the great- 
est caution, on account of the pain they oc« 
casion, and the foul sores they produce. 
When, however, petechiae, or the diverging 
lines, mentioned in the symptoms, appear, 
they must not be used, as then they are in 
particular apt to induce gangrene. 

When gangrenous symptoms appear, bark 
given both by the mouth and by glyster, is 
highly proper and necessary. Even, indeed, 
after the fever has disappeared, we ought to 



308 



administer nourishing diet^ with bark, 2cc# 
for several 'weeks, in order that we may re* 
store the languid powers of digestion. 

Port wtne, to the amount 6f one pint^ or 
even a quart a day, when debility and de- 
pression of jqpirits have come pn^ are ex- 
tremely proper* 



Core of rp^^ j^gj expedient in seasons when dyw 
sentery prevails, is to divide the sick, and 
lay them in churches and bams, or ruinous 
houses only, where neither they nor the 
nurses can confine the air. 

Copious discharges of bile have been found 
to relieve the symptoms of dysentery. In 
some cases, even without the use of medi- 
cines, the griping and tent^smus gradually 
diminish, and the stools return to their na- 
tural fippearance. 

Mucilaginous medicines, such as sago, 
&c. have been found of great benefit. The 
most proper drinks during this disease are 
cooling mucilaginous decoctions, corrected 
gently with aromatics, rice-water, oatmeal, 
gruel, lintseed-tea, decoctions of althea, &c. 
quahfied with a little mace^ cinnamon, car- 



ao9 



raway- seeds, &c. Milk ought not to be 
used in any stage of the complaint. 

If the patient be strong, and of a good 
constitution^ if the pulse be full, and there 
exists a considerable degree of fever, bleed* 
ing is both necessary and useful ; but if the 
symptoms be violent, the patient weak and 
depressed, with a feeble pulse, bleeding is in 
general improper. Blisters also, or fomen- 
tation .with warm liiquids, applied, to the bel- 
ly, are certainly attended with most benefi- 
cial effects. 

The most sticcessful cure of dysentery is 
obtained by an early attention to preventing 
the constriction and consequent stagnation 
of foeces in that part of the intestines called 
the colon. Early, therefore, in the disease, 
the frequent use of mi^d glysters, with a 
small proportion of laudanum mtxed> with 
them, are highly proper, particularly if ad- 
ministered immediately after stooL Glysteri 
are not so useful as purges. 

No medicine, therefore, is so much calcu^ 
lated ultimately to promote the regular ac« 
tion and direction of the peristaltic motion, 
as the repeated use of gentle emetics and 
purgatives. And, upon the whole, in ordi- 
nary cases, the regular administration of 
emetics and purgatives during the day, and 
anodyne diaphoretics during the nighty is the 



210 

most advisable practice. The neutral salt^ 
such as Glauber and Epsom, are useful pur- 
ges in this complaint ; so are castor oil. 
Rhubarb given along with calomel and jaU 
lap, when we wish to purge briskly, may be 
employed. All these must be given at first 
in very gentle doses, and gradually increas- 
ed till we effect the free evacuation of the 
bowels. 

Diaphoretics seem, in this disease, of 
much benefit, and small doses of opium and 
ipecacuanha, form a good medicine of this 
kind. Opiates in small doses seem to be more 
decidedly useful than in any other, where a 
great degree of intlammation prevails. Pro- 
bably from their effects in relieving the spas- 
modic action of the intestines, they relieve 
pain, suppress the constant desire to go to 
stool, while they laterly render the dischar- 
ges more free and less painful. Opium> 
then, as an antispasmodic, may be used 
with advantage in relieving the pain and con- 
striction of the intestines, but it is apt to 
produce costiveness. Perhaps other anti- 
spasmodics, not possessing such effects, may 
be used with greater advantage. An opiate 
and a purge given alternately often produce 
very beneficial effects. 

Where purging fails of giving relief, sali- 
vation with mercury has been recommended 



aii. 

M being useful. Where wine^ also, does 
not sour oa the stomach, it nlay be used 
with propriety ; but where this occurs, and 
the pulse and spirits are low, a little spirits 
and water is preferable. When acidity does 
prevail, magnesia will generally remove it^ 
Toward the termination of the disease, but 
liQt till then, when the inflammation has 
sabsidedt we may use glysters of « gently 
astringent nature. 

The . disease is aotnetimes combined with 
intermittent fever, when Peruvian bark may 
be used with propriety. Bark, indeed, in 
moat instances, may, during the whole course 
of the disease, be used with the greatest 
propriety. In cases where mortification is 
likely to ensue, bark seems to be our best 
remedy. Rhubarb may, at the same time, 
be given to prevent it lodging too long in 
the bowels. Camomile tea, also, used both 
internally, and in the form of glyster, is a ve« 
ry efficaceous remedy.

A cool light regimen will often keep dis- Cure of

more directly, to produce diseases of that 
viscus, while at the same time they have a 
tendency to weaken the tone of the sto- 
mach. 

Acute hepatites may be cured ]by resolu- 
tion, by purging, or by evacuations of blood, 
according to the urgency of the symptoms ; 
by blisters, fomentations, and by emollient 
glysters, and diluent and rc^fringent reme- 
dies. Depleting means, however, can only 
be useful in the early or acute stages of this 
disease. Blood-letting must be repeated 
according to the violence of the symptoms, 
and repeated blistering is always preferable 
to a single vesication. Saline laxatives are 
highly expedient, and very useful. Gentle 
sudorifics, also, are highly beneficial in pre- 
venting suppuration. Mercury, however, 
given to affect the mouth, is perhaps more 
advantageously used in hepatites, to prevent 
suppuration^ after antiphlc^stic regimen, 
bleeding and purging have been adopted 
without success ; and it has been thought, 
though perhaps unjustly, most successful 
when applied by friction over the region of 
the liver. 

Where, in this disease, inflammation and 
fever cannot be prevented, the flesh and 
strength more rapidly decrease, and in that 
state ^recovery is rather uncommon. But

by the remote causes of them, ias. well as hj 
the particular constitution of the peraon af- 
fected ; and consequently, in th|s adminiatra^ 
tion of medicines in these diseaaea, imich 
must depend on their particular oatnrei 
as well as on the peculiarity of conatitutioa 
of the person employing these means* 

I have always understood it to be a; good 
general rule in the treatment of certain <fia^ 
eases, to regulate the natural evacuaiiaafl^ 
end judiciously to. suppress morbid dischar* 
ges. • Both in heaHH and disease, it is aba 
to be recollected, that digestion is best per- 
formed during a state of rest. Dr Harwood 
of Cambridge fed two pointers equally well, 
the one he suffered to rest, the other be 
kept in constant exercise during two hours ; 
had them both killed ; in the one kept quiets 
the food was digested, but in the other, that 
process had scarcely begun. 

The most judicious treatment will not re« 
medy the disease, if the exciting causes 
continue to operate ; such as improprieties 
of diet, agitation of mind, sedentary babiti^ 
or impure air. Unless great attention^ 
tlierefore, be paid to the patient's food, me* 
dicines of any kind will do little or no 
good. Patients are consequently recom^

lived rather high, though complaints MVe 
not been induced by it, feel additional strength 
on the operation of a gentle purge. In some 




instances, violent pains in the bowels, par- 
ticularly among females, liave arisen from 
terror, grief, or anxiety. Hurtful loatls of 
drugs are prescribed, often ineffectually, for 
their removal, which might have been more 
safely and more permanently cured by re- 
moving the cause, or by an occasional pill 
composed of opium and assafoelida. In pains 
in the bowels, from whatever cause, recourse 
13 too often had to spirituous liquors, which 
are in most cases injurious. If they arise 
from diseased organs, the fixed pain in gene- 
ral attending these states will assist our judg- 
ment; if from improper quantity or quality 
of food, liquor of bad quality, &c. a vomit 
or purge, or one after the other, will in ge- 
neral relieve them. 

Provided no debilitating effects are indu- 
ced by purging, we need not be very hurried 
in relieving it ; but when the appetite fails 
and the flesh wastes, we should lose no time 
in its removal. 

In some habits, on the removal of a diar- 
rhoea, the system is irritable and the feelings 
unpleasant, the stomach is affected with 
flatulence, heartburn, and acidity. In such 
cases, half a dram of testaceous powder, with 
a little tincture of gentian, or of columba, 
and even four or five drops of laudanum, re- 
move it, -■■-■■■ >U' ■■ ilWU. .' i.lJ' JJ' l.--"3

On^^catttion necessary in every, affection 
of the bi>wels, is to prevent cosUveness. 
The bowdjB are often costive for a time, and 
then fits of purging come on, and, in order 
to prevent the latter, ,the obviating of. the 
former tnmt be particularly attended to* 

To excite the bowels into moderattt action 
in costiveness, by mild medicines, is hi^ly 
proper ; but as all great evacuations are after-- 
ward attended by costi veness, we ought : to 
avoid them. . To excite, therefore, the peri- 
staltic motion of the intestines without purg- 
ing, 40 as to promote the expulsion of what 
ought tojbe discharged, is of the very great- 
est importance. If we . can give purgative 
medicini^^.soas to excite and strengthen the 
bowels at the same time, we insure their 
very best effects. 

Oily and mvicilaginous substances are good 
aperient medicines ;.such arie castor oil, with 
or without a large proportion of mucilage. 

. Harrowgate water, lime-water, aloes with 
milk, tobacpo- smoke, or the infusion of ta- 
bai^co, are very useful ii^ectionb for the re- 
^loyal of ascarides. Cpmmon salt also, dig. 
solved in .wa^^jrj, has, when taken freely, been 
found of iwe in expelling. worn)s from the 
intestines. A dose of Calomel, likewise, 
given in combination with semen sdnumic^

or worm-seed, for two or three successive 
nights, at bed-time, is often 6i great service 
in expelling worms. 

In our various cures for this disea e, we 
are nevertheless very defective. Purgative 
medicines in general, howevc r, seem to be 
of considerable service ; and I have, parti-

If the po<H' alone were sufferers from the

not be so great that nothing has beea 'done 
for their prevei;vtion ; but the rich are often 
equal sufferers. I do not mean to say that 
ftiey are so in every respect. They are not 
like those cold and hungry wretches, who id

general eiperiatic^ a paroxysm of joy only 
^hen ill a state of intoxication, and who are 
obliged to hovel together in obscure and 
cheerless garrets, hardly protected even 
from the severity of the winter's storm ; or 
are compelled to groan out their existence 
in loathsome cellars, and to bi'ea'the an at-

infancy in the exercise of every thing that is 
vicious ; who, if they had been placed in more 
favourable physical circumstances, and ex- 
posed to more favourable moral opportuni- 
ties, might possibly have done honour to 
humanity. 

Thus, among these wretched people, dis- 
eases are generated, which in various w^ys 
are carried into every apartment in other 
parts of the city, which, from their local si- 
tuation and internal order, would but for this 
have been spared* 

From the observations I have thrown out 
on this subject, it may probably be expected 
th.'it I have some brilliant plan to propose 
M hich will thoroughly remedy all the faulta 
I have pointed out.

I know^ however, it is much easier to point 
outfaultSy than to propose su ;h apian for their 
removal as will meet with the approjbation of 
every person. The difficulty attending the 
execution of many useful plans has alone 
been sufficient to deter from the accom- 
plishment of them. Improvements are like- 
wise frequently abandoned by the interfer- 
ence of those whose interest it often is to 
suppress them, or even whose power is 

sufficiently great to effect this purpose. But 
in importatit public improvements, these pri- 
vate advantages ought to be particularly ex- 
amined, and should be sustained, only on 
condition that the improvements proposed 
are not to be of greater use to the public 
than the disadvantages the private individual 
will suffer from their removal. It should 
also at all times be recollected, that, in 
order to effect a general good, particular 
individuals ought to submit to inconvenien- 
ces, and even losses.

CHAP. I. 



OF NATUBAL GAUStt. 



Sect. 1.^0/ SoU. 

Thb 8oi) of Edinburgh^ and ite i^eigli* 
bourhood^ is very various. About the e^Sr 
tern extremity of the county^ and new tb^ 
sea^ it is light and sandy^ but in the greater 
proportion of the lands it partakes of a stiff 
clayey bottom. In some parts there exists 
moss^ and from the great irr^ulanty. of 
the ground near Edinburgh^ collectioas of 
rain and snow water form^ which render 
these particular parts extremely damp, or 
even constitute lakes of considerable depth ; 



331 



LimeBtone alsa exists iq various quarters of 
the county. The town, then^ is built on 
these smaller hills^ and in hollotvs of various 
depth and extent ; the hilly parts being of 
Aone, and the hollows generally boggy* 
To the eastward of the city these hollows 
are ako filled with every 6ort of matter in a 
putrid state ; the multitude of insects ge- 
nerated during the Summer months in 
these reservoirs of filth, is astonishingly 
great; and many of the neighbouring inha* 
bitants experience from them the most pain«^ 
ful bites and stings. 

It may jirobably be unilecessary to adduccS 
oiie instance in proof of the opinion^ that 
diseases have existed in consequehce of col* 
lections of nastiness in such hollows, and 
have completely disappeared when they werd 
rtmoved. I may, however, mention, as an 
example, the North-loch, that great hollow 
which divides the Old from the New TowUj 
and over which the North Bridge is built. 
It is of considerable depths and extends 
more than half a mile in length, commen- 
cing beyc^ the north- w^st. side, ©f the 
castle, and extending almost directly east- 
!iijrlird. While this continued less^or trk>ve

ef the filth and.nastiness which this city so

plentifully afforded, fonmng one masB of pa^ 
treiaciion, the diseases which were acknow-> 
ledgedly produced by it, w^re croup and in* 
teroEuttent fever ; and the clearest proof that 
these depended on its existence was, Ihat 
they have in a great measure disappeared since 
it was drained. We have every reason ta 
believe that other diseases also were proda- 
ced by it ; but of these, or their efiect^ 
from a want of proper discrimination, we 
are left completely ignorant. Since, hoiH 
ever, we are aware of a single circumstance 
or this sort, which formerly gave origin to 
diseases, which also disappeared on its re- 
moval, I think it bnt reasonable to suppose, 
that, by the removal of similar noisaoces in 
different parts of the country, we shoold be 
equally successful in removing all similar 
sources of contamination, and consequently 
oi disease*

Sbct* IL— C/imaftf of Edinhwr^u 

On account of the inequality of the 
ground about Edinburgh, the temperatnre is 
very unequal in the different parts of it at 
the same moment. 



233 



The foUowinpf observations on this sub- 
ject were made at Hawkhill, about a mile 
ironi the city, and 103 feet above the lev^el 
of Che sea. They comprehend the mean of 
three years, from 177% to 1774, which ap- 
pears to be 47*^ 7- 

The temperature is 47** 5, so that 
the iiiflerence is inconsiderable. 

Edinburgh is near the German 
ocean, wliicb is, upon the whole, 
two degrees warmer than the stan- 
dard ; but land, in this latitude, re« 
taining snow long after the degree 
of cold which produces it ceases, is 
always somewhat colder upon the 
whole, (let the circumstances be ever 
so favourable,) than the sea. 

With respect to the difference of climate 
upon the hills and in the vallies, I may ob- 
serve, that the lateDr Hutton of this place, 
found, that a thermometer kept at the top 
of Arthur's Seat, usually stood three degrees 
lower than a thermometer kept at the bot- 
tom of it. Hence the height of 800 feet 
occasioned three degrees of diminution in 
temperattire. 

The comparative heat of different heights, 
however, applies only to the temperature 
of the air during the summer montns.

In winter, the upper strata of the ' at- 
mosphere are warmer than the lower. 
Thus, on the 3l8t January 177^, the ther- 
mometer on the summit of Arthur^a Sot 
stood six degrees higher than a thermome- 
ter at Hawkhill, which is 634 feet lower. 
Mr Kirwah considers this superior heat, al- 
most uniformly observed during winter, as 
owing to a current of warm air from the 
equator, which rolls toward the north pole 
during our winter. 

Considering that there is but very little 
more than four degrees of latitude between 
Edinburgh and London, the difference of 
climate is remarkable. In the neighbour- 
hood of London, vegetables and fruits of dif- 
ferent kinds are more rapidly produced, and 
more luxuriant in their growth than in Edin- 
burgh ; and such fruits as grapes, cucum- 
bers, &c. can be raised in the open fields ; 
while, about Edinburgh, the greatest atten^ 
tion to the management of the hot* beds in 
which they grow is absolutely necessary, and 
even then these fruits are for the mosft part 
very imperfect* 

Storms of wind, or rather hurricanes, are 
often experienced in this city. It has been 
supposed by some, that, severe as we may 
conceive therp to be, th^ir violence is much 
abated by the mountains which immediately 



2SS 

surround the city, and afibrd it protectiod. 
ly however, completely dissent from this 
opinion, and am rather inclined to think, 
that the situation of these hills causes the 
currents of air which are here sometimes so 
alarming ; and for this reason in particular, 
that the contiguous low- lying towns of the 
Lothians are not infested in that Way. 

Hie north-east wind is observed to be the 
driest and the coldest on the whole of the 
eastern coast of Scotland. The easterly 
wind is of a very different description, being 
in general moist. During its prevalence^ we 
are seldom free from thick fogs, though 
completely free from them when the wind 
blows from any other quarter. These fog$^ 
though never equal to those of London, are 
often sa very great, as to render the city 
oompletely invisible^ except a few yards 
around the spectator^ and the chilly sensa- 
tions which are at all times felt during their 
continuance are, evtn t6 the most healthy, 
exti^emely unpleasant. Those liable to 
chronic disorders ever dread their approach ; 
and many, from certain feelings of a disa* 
greeable nature, can, several days previous 
to any apparent change of weather, foretell 
the particular nature of it with considerable 
accuracy. Nor are they patients affected 
with chronic complaints alone who suffer 

V 4 



030 



from such changes of weather ; for I believe 
many of our most acute diseases, if they dp 
not arise from it, are certainly rendered 
much more severe by it. At these tiroes, 
therefore, the greatest attention, both by the 
physician and patient, is absqlutely necessa* 
ry« Sudden changes in the state of the 
weather have often baffled our every exer- 
tion to remove some diseases, which^ under 
difFerent circumstances, were easily cured ; 
even some of the complaints of this place 
have, on such occasions, been reproduced 
after they had, for several weeks, been re- 
•moved. 

In this city and its immediate neighbour- 
hood, it generally rains less in March than 
in November, in the proportion, at a medi- 
um, of 7 to 12. It generally rains less in 
April than in October, in the proportion of 
one to two nearly, at a medium. It gene- 
' rally rains less in May than in September, 
and the chances that it does so, are at least 
as four to three ; when it rains plentifully in 
May, it generally rains but little in Septem^ 
ber ; and when it rains one inch or less in 
May, it rains plentifully in September. The 
htavif'St rains, however, at all times of the 
year, come from the east and south-east.^

Sect. III. — Sitiuztion of Edinburgh. 

Edtnbukgh is situated In 55^ 57' north 
Satitude, and in 3*^ 14' of longitude west 
from London. The town of Leith may now 
be considered as one of its suburbs. It stands 
in the northern part of the county of Mid- 
Lothian, about two miles south from the 
«hore of the Frith of Forth, which here is 
from five to seven miles in breadth ; and 
dbout 20 miles distant from the German 
ocean. 

The New Town stands on a gently eleva- 
ted plain to the north of the middle and 
west part of the Old Town. The New 
Town is perhaps one of the most elegant 
in the world ; and which, in many respects, 
forms a striking contrast to the Old Town* 
It is built on a regular plan, the streets run 
in strait lines, and are from 6o to J l6 feet 
wide. The houses are of stone, and for the 
most part of an equal height. Its length is 
more than a mile, and its breadth nearly half 
the extent, and it is rapidly increasing in all 
its dimensions. 



ass 



St Bernard's Well is situated immediate- 
Jy to the north-west of the New Town, in 
the beautiful picturesque glen in which the 
Water of Leith runs. Its water contains 
sulphureted hydrogen, which evaporates on 
boiling, leaving the water fit for every ordi- 
nary purpose. If the water possesses no 
medicinal effect, the fine walk to it is cer- 
tainly advantageous to health* 

Edinburgh is surrounded on all sides by 
lofty hills, except to the northWard> where 
the ground declines gently to t^e Frith of 
Forth. Although built on high ground, it 
stands about the middle of a dedivity, com- 
mencing at the top of Pen tland. hills on the 
south-west, and terminating at the shores 
of the Firth. 

The height of Arthur's Seat on the east, 
IS 700 feet from its bas^ and 819 firom the 
water-mark at Leith* S^lid^ury Craggs, 
about two-thirds of the same height, and 
separated from it by an immense valley, 
bounds the city on the east The beautiftil 
eminence of Corstorphine hill appears on 
the west or south*west, and the Calton hill 
toward the north of the Old, and the East 
of the New Town, is almost encompassed by 
them. Upon its summit is erected a monu- 
ment to the memory of Lord Nelson. The 
hills of Braid, and the extensive ridge of the 



239 



Pentland hills, rise to the south. These 
hills form a magnificent amphitheatre, in 
which, upon elevated, though in ground of 
less altitude than these, stands the Scotch 
metropolis about the middle of a declivity, 
commencing, as already stated, at the top 
of Pentland hills, and terminating at the 
shores of the Firth. 

Toward the north and north-west, on the 
opposite side of the Firth, the bold shores 
and hills of Fife appear. 

Thus, the high peak, the gentle declivity, 
and the frowning precipice, all here exhibit 
their respective peculiarities. From the lofty 
lind well ventilated mountainous exposure 
in our immediate neighbourhood, I may 
even say, in many parts of our city, the 
transition is very rapid to those pent-up 
vallies, or the lanes and closes constructed 
in them, where the breezes of health are 
scarcely ever felt. 

The Old Town of Edinburgh is principal- 
ly built upon an oblong hill or rather ridge, 
which is about a mile in length. This part of 
it is principally termed the High Street ; but 
is variously named in various parts ; and ex- 
tends from the Castle to Holyroodhouse. It 
terminates abruptly at the west side of the 
pastle, forming a precipice of 300 feet from 
^t5 base, but very gradually descends to its 



240 

other terminatiofn. It receives the name of 
the Castle^Hill nearest to the Castle, from 
the highest part of which the whole city 
and suburbs of Edinburgh can be distinctly 
seen ; a little farther down, it is called the 
Lawn Market, which extends to St Giles's 
Cathedral, when it is called the High 
Street ; farther down it is called the C^^ 
nongate, which name it preserves titl it 
terminates at Holyroodhpuse. From its 
commencement to its termination^ it rises 
^bout 180 feet; and its height from the 
high> water mark, at Leith is 274. 

Immediately on each side of this ridge^ 
the declivity is very rapid, terminating oi| 
the right in the Cowgate^ and on the left iri 
the North Loch. Houses have been built 
on every part of these precipices ; for I can 
call them nothing else, and the principal eur 
trances into them are by common passages 
from the street. That part of the street im* 
mediately over the North Loch, is^bout 140 
feet above the level of that drained morass, 
which divides the New Town from the Old, 

The situation of the Cowgate, which runs 
parallel to the High Street, immediately at 
the bottom of the opposite precipice, is very 
low, and, according to the early historians of 
Edinburgh, was once the seat ot a canal ox 



241 



river ; this, however, from the general de- 
clivity of the ground, does not seem pro- 
bable. 

Prom the top of the ridge above- mention- 
ed^ Harrow lanes descend on both sides cal- 
led Closes. Many of them are extremely 
steep and difficult of passage, and theii- 
width rarely exceeds six feet. Those of 
krger extent, and which admit of a car- 
riage, are called fVynds. 

Froni the local situations of these places, 
we would not be apt to expect great purity 
of atmosphere, and if we did, we should be 
grievously disappointed. 

In the year 1504, we are informed, the 
tract of ground to the southward of the city, 
called the Boroughmoor or myre, was total- 
ly covered with wood, though it now affords 
no vestige of its ever having been in such a 
state. The quantity, however, was at that 
time so great, that the town-council enact- 
ed, that whoever should purchase as much 
of the wood as was sufficient to make a ne\V 
front to their house, might extend it seven 
feet farther into the street. The efiect of 
this was such, that in a short time, Edin- 
burgh was filled with houses of wood instead 
of stone ; and the principal street, the beau- 
ty of which consisted in the height of its 



Q43r 

buildings^ and its sptciow widths Was reda* 
ced 14 feet in breadth. 

The city of Edinburgh was in early, tidies 
surrounded by a high walf^ which was fear- 
ed for its defence. From the great exttfn«- 
sion of the city^ however^ sitiee that period^ 
the remains of this wall are in many places 
almost in the middle of it. 

Edinburgh is supplied with excellent wa- 
ter from the neighbouring hills^ whence it is 
conveyed in aqueducts^ and distributed to 
every family in leaden pipes. 

The principal reservoir for supplying 
Edinburgh with water stands on the top of the 
ndrth side of the High Street, and^ from its 
elevated situation, afibrds an easy conyeyaaee 
to the level of any part of the town. 

An inexcusable act of the town-counc3 
was the late order, that the lead pipes for 
conveying the water shouhl be dug out, and 
sold for ' the purpose of a present supply of 
money, and cast iron and wood onesi, wbicb 
require almost constant repairs, substituted 
for them. 

The markets of Edinburgh, which may 
best be brought under this head, afford aH 
the necessaries, and many of the luxuries, of 
life in coQisiderable variety, 
: The vegetable market is supplied, ort the 
most reasonable terms, with every sort of 



043 

h6rb which b to be ibund in thii part of the 
island. 

AU kinds of poultry and game are to be 
bad ia great plenty. 

During the spring months, our batcher 
market is plentifully supplied with veal and 
lanab of most excellent quality ; in the latter 
end of summer and autumin with beef and 
mutton of very superior quality ; and in win- 
ter with. pcwk. Venison^ also> is sometimes 
to be net with, but not often. 

The above are the seasons for these dif- 
feient acmnals, though they are to be met 
with thpoi^hout the whole year ; but being 
then fed on forced raeat^ such as the refuse 
of distilleries^ &c. they are never so good. 

The best beef which is brought to Edin^ 
borgb is the Highland stott^ when not killed 
until foinr or five years old, having a fine fla^ 
vour^ and being tender, and much finner in 
4he fibre than the low country or Englisb 
breed* The Highland mutton, also^ is pre-^ 
ferable to any other. The white-faced ok 
English breed of sheep, are generally killed 
wh«3 young, at about 12>br 14 months old, 
at whidi time their mutton is coarse, prodo- 
ces onlj^i a white gravy, and when these anii- 
mals are fedi to two or three years, they 
come monstrously fat. 



044 



The fish to be bad in the market aire sal* 
mon from December to October ; common 
trout and sea trout during spring and ^m- 
mer ; and spirling during IVforchand April, 
at which time they ascend the river Forth 
in millbns. Pike, perch, and eels^ are veiy 
common, the last of which are nofc much 
demanded. The supply of cod and had* 
dock is almost uninterrupted. Ling is less 
common than cod, and sells at higher prices* 
Whitings are very common, and, in aotatnn, 
are often of a large size. A shoal of pil* 
chards generally precedes the herrings, and 
are to be found in the market in October 
and November ; after which herrings set in 
and continue till March. In May and June 
vast quantities of sprats, or garvey* herrings, 
are brought to market. Mackarel are sold 
during summer, but seldom in large quanti- 
ties. The sea cat, or wolf fish, is not un- 
common in the market, but is often despised^ 
on account of its name by those who do not 
know its excellence at the table. The male 
lump-fish, or padle, is brought to market in 
April and May. The female is not eatable* 
The supply of flat-fish is copious. Holibut 
and turbot are pretty common during the 
summer. Soles are rather rare, and of a 
small size. Plaice, dab and flounder, are to 
be found in the market almost every day in

feet order, are made, in some instances, to 
descend through the very stairs by which 
the inhabitants pass to their houses. To at- 
tempt, however, to give a description of the 
int^nal appearance of these, and many such 
houseb of this city, where large families are 
brought up, would be a very painful and diffi- 
cult task. Indeed, I question if any description 
could convey an accurate idea of the scenes 
of extreme misery which the wretched inha- 
bitants are every day obliged to endure in 
'tach places. Often ten or more individuals 
are crammed into one very small apart- 
ment, where they sleep, cook their victuals, 
and ;exist almost constantly, except that part 
of them whose occupations require their 
'absence from these hauntis a few hours eve- 

m 

'tj day. Thus they are obliged to live with- 
out having it in their power to breathe any 
atmosphere, particularly during th^ night, 
but such as has been previously in the lungs 
of some of their fellow lodgers. In this 
way the poor miserable wretches exist often 
without a murmur, partly from the narrow- 
ness of their circumstances, and partly from 
their being unconscious, from habit, of the 
existence of a better situation. 
' There are, indeed, few parts of this city. 
Inhere under-ground houses to a greater or 
less extent are not to be found. So ace us-

tomed are thousands of the inhabttantB to 
live in these places, and so filthy hiive th^ 
become even in their very naiar^j^ that I 
know it would be a difficult task to convince 
them of their unhealthy situation* I have 
often remonstrated with them on the im- 
propriety of living in such hovels^ and thejf 
were even perfectly astonished at my Ex- 
treme ignorance. They frankly acl^now- 
ledged that many of their children, and other 
of their relations, die ; but this they con- 
tentedly attribute to a ^^ a greater power 
than th^y can contradict/^ And in order tp 
prove the impossibility 6{ s^6h places being 
the cause of disease and death, they r^ 
counted a few solitary instances of loi^ life 
which have perhaps occurred in their family, 
or in that of their neighbours. Thus stub- 
born prejudicesji ignoraUcet nastiness^ and 
poverty, seem very intimately combined^ 
and, consequently, reasoning u^ith such be» 
ings will never have any rapid efifept in 
amending these faults. 

The decided .advantage^ which the New 
Town possesses over the Old must be evi^ 
dent to the most comipon observer. The 
free ventilation which can be commanded 
in every part of it, the wide streets, and the 
lofty well built airy apartments, are all adr 
vantages which it possesses in a very supe«

pppr<;^riat^d .to l;he purpose of deeping in, 
j^qwev&c .dry a situation that apartment may 
seem to be. I have made very minute enr 
qiHry respecting the comparative number of 
<leaths t^t^at for several years past have taken 
l^laqe ^i houses with their sleeping apart* 



252 

• • 

inent$ under ground^ and others with them 
^bove it, and I find, that the thortality prt>-* 
bably caused in consequence of the sleeping 
apartments 'being underground is incredibly 
greater than takes place where they ar6 
above it. A variety of families in Edinburgh 
have even remarked an evident decline in their 
health from the time they inhabited under* 
ground houses. In som^s hoi^es, on the 
contrary, which I could point out, the super- 
incumbent earth has been removed, and dis- 
eases which existed in them prcfvious* to this 
have disappeared. 

In the construction of the principal part 
of the Old Town of Edinburgh, common 
sewers were neglected, and the inhabitants 
emptied all manner of filth into the atreeito 
over night. It was then barely excusable ; 
^ut now that this objection is, in a 'great 
measure, removed, independent of all our 
laws for the internal managethent of ottrci^ 
ty, to find similar practices perseteired. in, is 
shockingly disgusting and highly disgrace- 
ful None can walk the streets of the Oldi 
Town in the morning and evening without 
being almost suffocated. In the New Town> 
however, no such practices are known. 

It is but just, however, to remark^ that 
the various hospitals erected for charitable 
purposes have of late years undergone con-* 



253 



siderable changes for the better, both in 
their external and internal construction. 
The directors or managers of these hospi- 
tals are entitled to much merit for having 
directed much of their attention to the 
cleanliness, modes of living, and the strictly 
reKgious and moral conduct of their inhabi- 
tantStf 

The local situation, as well as the internal 
arrangement of Bridewell, which is built on 
an elevated situatien on the Calton Hill, 
seems, in every respect, much better calcu- 
lated to the comfort and health of the pri- 
soners, than any building of the sort in this 
city,— perhaps in this country. Instead^ 
however, of glass windows, liable to be shut 
by the prisoners at pleasure, they ought 
to be left completely open, during all the 
summer months^ by the entire removal of 
the glass ; and these openings ought only to 
be shut during the cold months of winter. 
The rooms are large €nough,-if the windows 
are kept' open, but too small to be kept shut 
in Slimmer. 

• Our ^ant of a well-aired prison must have 
been- sieverely felt by many. The one, how- 
ever, now building, if carried into execution, 
must be a great amendment. Still, inde- 
pendently of every other internal advan- 
tage, its situation must be against it, as suf- 



%»4 



ficient supplies of fresh air. cannot be |Kro« 
cured. Certainly a prison, may be easily 
constructed on Inckieiihf m the Frith, foor 
those who may have oommitted capitat 
crimes ; and one for debtors, HQf fDay be 
placed in the suburbs, perhaps near Bricto- 
well, both of which would be of greal a4- 
vantage in preserving the health of tibiae 
who bad the misfortune to be C4Wifine4 in 
them. 

No prison ought to be in the very heart 
of a city. As most of the diseases tq Ibein^ 
places originate from want of pure air and 
sufficient exercise, improper diet, depres* 
sioD of spirits, exposure to cold and unclefii- 
Itness, it is evident that the preventioii or 
the removal oi the^ oij^ht ta be our &vt 
object. 

Prisons oi:^ht to he built oa a faec^ of 
sloping ground which should be dry, and, 
which at all times may be c^me, 8o;^iendy 
elevated toadmitof jthe fresloi breeds through 
it llius situated, the wall surrouoding it 
may be sufficiently high, and yet it may not 
in the least impede the free circulalioD of sit- 
in these places, subterFaneous dungeons 
are quite unnecessary, and, being highly in* 
jurious to health, ought never to be 4:ou^ 
structed. 



255 



JEvcry cell ^nd room in them ought to have 
two windows opposite each other to admit of 
their being more perfectly ventilated. The 
courts should be large, apd paved with broad 
Btones« 

The exercise best suited to prisoners, is 
walking, and working at some sort of em- 
ployment* Money obtained for such labour 
ought wholly/ or in part, to be given to the 
prisoner as ap .encouragement to industry. 

Were my power as great as my wish^ I 
should decidedly protest against every alter* 
Ution in any part of this or any other 
city, where improveqfients were more cair 
tpulated rather to prevent than to accelerate 
ventilation. Que instance of this kind I 
may addfice in the present alterations taking 
place in the Parliament Square^i which may 
be useful in collecting a little more money 
.%o the public revenue ; but mi^st be proppr* 
tionally pfejudical to the health of those si- 
tuated in its imrpediate neighbourhood 

It is not l^e wpndered, that in close con- 
fined houses, situated in narrow streets or 
lanes, diseases of the very worstt kind are 
to be found, when houses, constructed on 
|he same absurd principle, althouglf actual- 
ly situated in the best ventilated parts, are 
equally productive of the most malignant 
complaints. To adduce a variety of instances 



i. >

in support of this assertion^ would be uc^ 
necessary. I shall point out one, which wiB 
serve as a very clear proof of it. It, exteN 
nally considered, is as freely and openly ^x» 
posed, as any other house in this neigb^ 
bourhood. I allude to that house whicfai 
stands on the south side of the King*« Park^ 
upon the brow of the declivity which terroir 
hates Salisbury Craggs. To the front, it 
stands in an elevated situation, the ground 
floor being considerably above the common 
level of the ground almost immediately in 
front of it. The back of the house^ how- 
ever, the declivity being extremely rapid, if 
completely under ground^ and the hill sud- 
denly ascends behind it upwards of 100 feet. 
The floors and walls, particularly to the 
back^ are consequently damp, and the great- 
er part ^f the inhabitants are, at least nine 
months out of the twelve, affected by some 
epidemic disease ; sometimes of one sort and 
sometimes of another; but which are aD 
evidently occasioned by the circumstances, 
which I have stated above. 

By the bye, I may mention one other pro. 
bable cause of this extraordinary sickness. 
Upon the west side of this house, only a fevf 
yards distant from it, there exists one of the 
town's reservoirs for the collection of filth, 
which must tend greatly to vitiate the aic;^

Ihouses iudthe neighbourhood are irtuoli

inuch exposed to i the efHuvia of sUch mass^^ 

jof corruption. Their houses^ however^ arfe 

4evel with-.^he ground^; and they are not 

jt& unhealtb3^.as the inh^bitants in the house

y. I could compare this house first described 

.with another house similarly situated ia re- 

*gar4 tO' local circumstances ; but not nearly 

•TO well ventilated without. That to which I 

• allude, is the house lately built by Mr Words- 
irarth at the foot of the Cat ton Hill; the 
ground before as well as behind it, is nearly 
•imilai- to the one I first described^ and even 
ialthough it is not near! j^ sd well ventilated 
externally, the drains that he has ingeniously 
caused to be constructed between the ground 

• behind the house and thehouse itself, suffix 
ciently serwe the purpose of preventing any

The principal manufactories^ which lestf

great extent, and here> as in inost other fkrU 
of Scotland, is used very profusely, tending 
greatly to injure the health of particuhHy 
the lower orders of society. Our ale is per^

well that this wholesome beverage wiere sub-

Sect^III. Modes of Living in Edinburgh, 

In proportion as civilization advances in 
any coantry, it v^ould appear that the modes 
<^ living of its inhabitants, at least of that 
part of its inhabitants who more immediate- 
ly fall under the inflaence of such changes^ 
become more refined 

We find that, in Edinburgh, about 1598^ 
♦ the victuals even of the nobility were of the 
coarsest kind. They consisted chiefly of 
oat-meal cooked in a variety of ways, and 
their drink was pure winfe. The better sort 
(rf* citizens lived much in the Same way ; only 
their drink was chiefly strong-ale of their 
own brewing, of which they drank amazing 
quantities. Both sorts of people always 
drank to much greats excess than the En- 
glish. 

The modes of living of the present day 
among the poorer classes of the people, who 
always constitute the greater mass of society, 
are in general no better than in the earliest 
periods of our history ; in some instances 
perhaps they are much worse. 

Among them, the food is in a great mea- 
sure composed of oat and pease-meal, : pre- 
pared for use in a variety of ways. The first 
ofthese^ when gradually mixed with watei? 
and a little salt, and boiled in a pot over the 

VOL. II. B 



i6a 



fir0 coristitutesppmd^ ; and the otber fcMnis 
which this tnay, in common with the pease- 
li^ea), be put to^ are brose\ scones, dr baanocks, 
and' cakes. The brose is ibrroed by^a quao^ 
%xiy of meal with a Httle aalt, whictv is put 
into a dish, and while <me p<^rs(». alirs it^ 
another^i or perhap9>the aame person^ poum 
boiling water upon k, till the mesft becomes 
qF an ordinary consistetice. This and the 
pot ridge are eaten only while warm, and wtH 
uaed^ Q(ten in amazing ^[iiantitieSi with mUk 
pr b^en The' ficoi»ea or bannocks^ and 
cakes, are formed by ibci same kind of nteal^ 
kneaded with w^er and. a littlei $ii}t» ani 
tpa^d over or bffor^ th^ fire. These are 
used cold,a$.a substitcrte for loaf Wcad. 

Thereia another curious dish peculiar to 
the country, composed, partly of oaX-msai^ 
called a fiaggisj which was once much more 
Dsed about this place than it is aow t It is 
however still retained among certain claaaea 
of people. Many improvements, have hxAf 
been made upon i\m tiish^ and it is now 
Hiade. in a variety of ways ; but the true 
Scotch haggis is composed of oai-mesip ani^ 
mal-fat^ a pretty large proportion of onions, 
and; pepper and salt in considerable quantity. 
These are mixed together and put into a 
sheep^s stomach, which is sewed close^ and 



ii6a 

the whole is boUed among water. This dish 
ig. used only while hot. 

The lower orders of people, too', consume 
immense quantities of the intestines*, heads, 
&d^ and other refuse of kiHied ari?»mals, for 
which the superior coders of society can find 
no ude; To see these lean attd naked 
iHivetcheS' hovering about the shambles, 
watching to pick up any such apparently 
. ttteless morsels^ is most humiliating, and ex- 
t»e*iety painful to those who are capable of 
feeling for the ufifortuntfte, and' pitying the 
distresses of that neglected, btut numerotis 
part of the community. 

The modes of living atiUMig the higher 
ardeirs> of society, I meau those wbop take a 
pleasure: in: making regularity a part of their 
ditty, is extremely proper. 

Among alt' sorts of people, the greatest 
Hijttry sustained to the fabric is more in con- 
sftqnefice of the use of often very bad spirit'^ 
OU0 liquors^, than by eating any kind of food^ 
although, in many instances, the victualsr 
are co^vse* enough . 

At every period of the year, stbmach com- 
plaints^ are here very' common; but I have 
ai^says observed^ that, frorn^ one to three or 
lour months after the commencement of the 
year, wheny according to the abiwird custom^ 
qf this pavt of the worlds drinking is a spe-^ 



^64 



cies of irregularity too commoti amorlg us, 
these complaints are .always more frequent 
and more obstinate, than at any other time. 
Indeed, the immoderate use of ardent sptrit» 
in this country is much too*, common v and 
I will venture ta say, that this is productkre 
»ot only of stomach complaints, but ofyper- 
haps, the greater proportion of diseases that 
come under the care of the physician. 

Although dyspepsia, in its most distress* 
ing and obstinate form, is almost always the 
first effect of this practice, it is soon follow* 
ed, if the habit be persevered, in, by an aW 
most complete and irreparable, derange-^ 
ment of the digestive organs. > 

Those unaccustomed tQ live in^ a country, 
and among people who use such immense 
quantities of ardent spirits, as we are in the 
habit of using, are apt to imagine that, after 
the continued use of this destructive po- 
tion, they are at last destroyed by the almost 
immediate effects of one of their doses ; but 
this is not the case, for with us^ where I am 
sure there is more ardent . spirits consumed 
than in any other part of the world, it will 
be found, that an amazing number of linger •i^ 
ing, yet fatal, diseases are produced by the 
use of it ; and where one person suffera 
inKnediate death by this means, many thou- 
sands drag out a miserable existence. The 



165 



opinion, that ardent spirits destroys the in- 
dividaal suddenly, will be found to be form^ 
ed not according to the fact, but according 
to the opportunities the practitioner has of 
seeing, perhaps, a few solitary instances of 
sudden death from apoplexy in consequence 
of drinking. 

It has frequently been urged by authors, 
and others, that particular climates, or par- 
ticular states of climate, render it necessary 
for the inhabitants to use spirituous liquors, 
and other substances, to prevent the bad ef- 
^ fects of the^e climates from producing disease 
iamong them. This is a very indefinite way 
of going to work, and, in my opinion, is 
frequently productive of much harm. In 
whatever country a person may be placed, if 
he enjoys good health by attending to that 
ftioderation both in eating and drinking, 
Which preserves his mind in its greatest vi- 
gour, and his body in its greatest activity, 
he requires no assistance from spirituous li- 
quors, which, if persevered in, under the 
above circumstances, must sooner or later be 
productive of much injury. But if the 
health is likely to be injured by the particu- 
lar local circumstances of any country, pro- 
perly regulated indulgencies in these things 
rriay be made. Still, however, these will 

! afford but teinporary relief, and it will be 

B 3 



7m 

better for the person to change that fot ^ 
CQUDtry more con^^enial tp his health. 



Sect. W.-^Manners^ of Edinburgh. 

The manners of the people of Edtnburgl^ 
are certainly of kte much altered for the 
better. Since this city has become the 
seat of affluence and fashion^^ the intercourse 
pf society has greatly contributed to the re- 
moval pf that want pf polish which OQt 
iBoulhern neighbourSj for instance^ deemedj^ 
perhaps jastly^ very unpleasant* 

In the$e earlier periods, even the polite- 
ness of the people was, to those unaccuir 
tomed to itj particularly distressing. Dur- 
ing dinner, or at any other meal, or while 
partaking of refreshment of any ^ind, their, 
insisting on strangers in particular to contin 
nue to eat or drink« after the accommodat* 
intr (iisposition of the person had even car- 
ried him farther than he wished, was ex^ 
tremely leazing and disagreeable. I have 
even been informed of these good people 
CD) ceiving themselves highly injured, if, by 
the exuberance of their kindness, they did 
not first surfeit their visitors at dinner^ and 



267 



^complete the scene by making them noto- 
Hously drunk before they parted. Among 
ceittain classes thi^se customs are stiii in ex- 
' cellent preservation ; and even while, in 
comparing them with others of a more iho- 
dern date, we dp not entirely approve df 
them, yet we do not feel disposed entirely 
to blame such manners, when we reflect up^- 
on the generous motives which givjs rise id 
them. 

The manners, on the contrary, of the 
more modern, particularly the higher classes 
pf society, are often extremely elegant, in 
whatever situation they may be viewed. 
The introduction of the other improve- 
ments among th^m has, in a great me^isure, 
removed in every class that sheepish re^rve, 
which, in earlier times, was very conspicu- 
ous. 

Sftill^ however, the female^ possess ti suf- 
ficient portion of modest reserve, and digni- 
ty of demeanour, which, when added to their 
other charms, ref^der thiein excessively in- 
teresting, much more so, perhaps, than is 
to be found among their southern neigh- 
)x)Ur8, where the continual i^outine of lux u^ 
ry has entirely rooted out their genuine 
feelings, and substituted for thefh that sense-

The general regularity of manners which 
prrvails in the metropolis of Scotland has 
Ik^« remarked by every stranger. No city 
ift Europe contains so large a proportion of 
iKCii of an enlightened and of a polished 
i^har^cter ; or a body of common people so 
^i^t educated and respectable. 

In many respects, then, the manners of 
ll^e inhabitants of Edinburgh have, for these 
two or three centuries past, improved very 
««uch. In some, however, particularly among 
1)1^ lower orders of society, the alteratioo 
^iM>e that period is very trifling. 

The common filth and nastiness in and 
ultHuit the city of Edinburgh have been pro- 
X<rbial all over Europe from the very earli- 
^1 periods of its history. To this we are 
VtirrMnted to attribute many of those disas- 
\f\A\^ epitlemii s formerly known under the 
IMIUO of the plague^ leprosy^ &c. which in 



a6g 

early times committed such ravages among 
it« inhabitants. , 

After the defeat at Flowden^ in 151 3, the 
plague, as it was called, raged with great 
violence in this city, carrying off immense 
numbers of its inhabitants. Acts of council 
were instantly passed, ordering various mea- 
sures for stopping the contagion, but they 
seem to have been attended with very in^ 
considerable benefit; probably from their 
Jbeing of too limited a nature, or because 
their full import was not acted up to. As a 
solitary proof of the vitiated taste which 
inust have been prevalent about the year 
1553, an act of common- council was then 
made, prohibiting all dunghills from. being 
made on the principal streets ; and it was, at 
the same time, ordered, that swine should 
not feed or live upon these dunghills. 

This disease, then, visited the city at va- 
tious periods ; but, since i645, it has not 
madc^its appearance. The mortality at this 
tune, ^tlbwcver, was very gr^t, as by it the 
city was almost depopulated. The alarm 
was so great, that prisoners confined for 
debt were liberated ; and one Dr John Poli- 
tius, a foreign empiric,, the. only person who 
would attend the sick, : received for his at- 
liendance bOl. Scots per month. 



270 

Bad as we may conceive these nuisances to 
be at present^ they must in earlier times have 
been much more horrible. Permanent sources 
of nastifiess, and consequently of disease^ do 
however, still exist in a very considerable de- 
gree ; and those who have been absent from 
Edinburgh for a number of years, remark^^ 
that however rapid we have been in improv- 
ing oar city in other respects, we have been 
sufficiently tardy in the removal of the caus« 
es of filth and nastiness. This is shameful. 
Why is there no fine inflicted on those who 
transgress in this way, and a person a^ 
pointed to see it regularly collected I A, 
few years of such strict attention would ren- 
der these measyires unnecessary. The man- 
ners of the people are daily altering for the 
better, and, unless among the lower order$ 
of society, to which such measures alon« 
could apply, no such scenes as I have alludr 
ed to are to be found. With some of them^ 
indeed, something more than mere atten- 
tion to their manners is necessary \ for, in 
several instances, from the extreme wretch^ 
edness of their habitations, partly in conse** 
quence of local situation, it is beyond the 
power of human art entirely to improve 
them in respect to cleanliness. 

Nuisances exist among the lower ranks, 
which by them are never complained of, or 



271 



Itttempted to be reitioved ; and it is to these 
fliat the police of our city ought principally 
to attend. They vitiate the air which the 
lowest inhabitants are. in common with the 
^rst ranks in society, obliged to respire eve- 
fy minute of their lives. I am sensible that, 
ill many^ this dqes not immediately, or per* 
haps not at all, produce disease ; but surely 
it must neither be a very pleasing, nor a ve- 
ry cleanly reflection^ that substances con- 
stantly emanating from such masses of filthi* 
xiess shall be suffered to have a free passage 
into the lungs with every breath we draw, or 
pvery morsel we cat. 

Tamely to submit to such nastiness^ is an 
act of indelicacy^ which nothing but vile 
custom could sanction, and none but those 
yi\\o are only cleanly by stealth could submit 
to. Every means, therefore, in the power 
^f those who possess fortune ought to be 
lexerted for their removal ; and I hope, ii| 
this respect, I shall have less reason to com- 
jpkun at every future period of my existence

Inflammatory diseases are most frequent 
in this part of the country, particularly dur- 



272 



ing the winter months. These appear in 
yarious forms in different persons, according 
to the particular state of their system at the 
moment, the nature of the season, or their 
local situation. The most immediately fatal 
to life, however, seem to be pneumonia^ 
(see vol. i. p. 229.) Catarrh (see p. 227) is 
more common, but is of itself not so de- 
structive of life; Various other inflamma- 
tory diseases prevail amongst us, such as in- 
flammation of the bowels, &c &c. ; and 
among children hydrocephalus is very com* 
moD. 

The consequences of these complaint^ 
which usually exist most plentifully dliring 
spring and summer, are dropsy in various 
forms, (see page 247-); effusion into the 
ventricles of the brain, (see page 238.;) 
leucorrhasa, (see page 252.) &c. Stomach 
complaints, (see page 269) particularly 
among those who indulge freely in the use 
€)f ardent spirits, are very common ; Md 
typhus fever (see page 254 ) is never abseoi 
throughout the whole year, but isparticalier-' 
ly 'severe during the summer months. 

There arc, indeed, many other very gener 
rally prevailing complaints, but these being 
the most formidable, I have found it neces- 
sary to confine myself to a brief considera^ 
tion of them and their effects.

The cidebrated Dr Cullen, from observ- 
ing the effect of the effluvia arising from 
marsh miasmata, founded his doctrine of fe- 
,ver, upon the supposition of such effluvia 
being the principal cause of such diseases. 
He applied his doctrines to this very city, 
and adduced local proofs so strong in favour 
of them, that even had they been advanced 
by one qf ordinary reputatign, more atten- 
tion ought to have been paid to the removal 
of such causes. But, after the opinions and, 
and observations of such a man, their exis- 



274 

tetice being permitted^ where human art and 
industry could easily remove them^ is an act 
of guilt on the part of those who have the 
power of ordering such amendments^ and 
their breach of duty to the community is 
consequently too evident to require any il- 
lustration on my part. Besides, in neglect- 
ing those measures^ so evidently calculated 
to the preservation of the public healthy 
they insensibly create fpr themselves and 
their families^ numberless chances of being 
infected with epidemical diseases^ which 
might entirely be prevented by proper at- 
tention bemg paid to the removal of the ac- 
knowledged sources of them. In this point 
of view, the only one, in my opinion, which 
can be taken of it, thc^,. without due consi- 
deration, daily expose themselves to those 
chances of disease, which, from their care- 
lessness and inattention, the ki6oucing part 
of the community are exposed ta. 

The soil of the Meadow& of E^diaburgh, 
in particular, will, however,, soon be in^ror^ 
ed, as the Magistrates have ali^eady begun a 
drain from them toward the seaiir Thisy 
certainly, ought to be done with regard to

though the free ventilation, from the ele^

tion of such ah improvement would at once 
be complied virith, and, I dare say, willingly 
paid for, by the proprietors and inhabitants.

Sect. Ih^^Police for Climate qf Edinburgh. 

Although ventilation has probably no re- 
markable effebt in decomposing noxious 



276 



effluvia, yet certainly^ situated as Edinburgh 
is, upon a considerable eminence, it is of 
very great importance in wafting it to a dis- 
tance from the abodes of the inhabitants. 
Whatever, therefore, tends to promote ven- 
tilation, particularly where it is most neces- 
sary, must be of the greatest service *. In 
every improvement, therefore, or in adding 
to the extent of Edinburgh, this object 
ought to be particularly kept in view ; and 
certainly the more frequent the intersection 
of streets, &c. in every situation, but parti- 
cularly in the lower lying places, is an 'jOb-« 
ject which cannot be too much attended 
to. 

Our next object is to purify those parts 
where ventilation is not so practicable ; and 
certainly, according to Dr Priestley's expe- 
riments, the willow plant is so efficacious in 
purifying foul air, we ought to have it plant- 



* T have no hesitation in asserting, that the 
Wynds and Closes^ as they are called, have, in the 
Old Town, been often, in this respect, of much 
use. The circulation of air through them, during 
the high winds which prevail here, is very great^ 
and must, though unobserved, have contributed 
greatly to the prevention of disease.

Sect. IIL^^Police for Situation ofEdin^ 

burgh: 

There is perhaps no city or tbwn in the 
#orld better calculated, from its local situa^ 
tfoti, than Ekiinburgh, to be almost perfect- 
ly free of every degree of filth and nasti*- 
ness, and consequently of the diseases result 
sng from the^e causes. From the Pentlatid 
hills to the Frith of Forth^ it forms a gradci- 
111 declivity ; and although much irregulari- 
ty of surface exists in the intervening space^^ 
yet neither lake, marsh, nor collectionf of 
filth, ought to be known ks a nuisance, asy 
with a little expence, and no very great la- 
bour, it may be cdnveyed to such a distance 
from the city as to be completely beyond the 
reach of either destroying the comforts, or 
afiecting the healthy of the inhabitants. 

Thete advantages, from the general local 
ilituation of Edinburgh, are much neglected, 
and stagnant waters, occasioning putrefac- 
tion, at all times unpleasant,, and, during the 
:tommer monthsi in particular, productive. 

tOL. u. s

of disea^, are suffered to extst in various 
parts of our neighbourhood; 

Private individuals can do little in these 
matters ; it is therefore to be expected^^ as 
an act of great humanity, as well as of self- 
preservation, that our present magistrates 
will no longer soflfer their own, with the 
health of the community, to be thus coritai- 
minated. 

Although, from the particular natmie of 
imt climate, we run less risk of being affects 
«d by diseases froov putrefaction, than is 
tbosf^ where greater heat exists, and where 
ihoisture, which assists in the dissemination 
of oontagious effluvia, at certain 'periods of 
the year abou^s, yet we know, from expe- 
rience, that we are not wholly exempt from 
Ihem. The internal police of every city 
ttnd town ought therefore to fbe vigilant in 
the -detection and removal of all such sour^ 
ees<^ -disease. 

There are, almost immediately east- 
ward of the city, collections of filth, chiefly 
Irom the termination of the common sewr 
ers, which contaminate the atmosphere^ 
particularly during the prevalence of easter- 
ly winds, and their effluvia are immediate- 
iy wafted into the very houses of those 
who inhabit that part of the suburbs^; must 



V9 



prove highly injurious both to the comfort 
and hedth of tliose ii^habitants who live; 
near it* These may be entirely removed j 
by carrying the drains which convey the 
filth of the city to a greater distance^ s6 
that the putridity of those parts, greatly 
increased by the heat of the summer, may 
be far enough removed to prevent tb^ con- 
tamination of that part of the atmosphere 
1(^hich the inhabitants must of necessity 
bi^eathe. In thetr pi^esent states during, 
itsormy weather, the gross particle^ of filth 
are even blown into the faces of the inhabi- 
tants 

With tegard to the internal maiiagement 
dP those nuisances which exist within the 
eity, much may be done in the way of im* 
^rovement. Most of them admit of it, and 
ttiany of them may be entirely disperised 
^ith; 

The establishment of the flesh and fish 
hiarkets is very pirdperly made in a cen tri- 
bal situation ; and when the^e ate kept 
jproper\y in order, ho contamination of 
the surrounding atmosphere can arise fronri 
them. Thi$, however, particularly ifi the 
latter, is not attended to, as every one 
<nust have felt who walks along the North 
Bridge. But that the shambled should like^ 
%i8e be placed there, will appear to every 

92 



380 



one highly improper. I think I need only 
pomt out this circuingtance^ to convince all 
unprejudiced persons of the great necessity 
there is for some alteration being adopted in 
this department of police. At all times of 
the year, but more particularly in the summer 
months, every one passing along the North 
Bridge must also have acquired a most per- 
fect experience of this mass of putridity^ 
which, when accompanied by the effluvia 
arising from the^contiguous refuse in the fish- 
market, is truly horrible, and musty in par« 
ticular, be highly prejudical to those inhabit 
tants who occasionaly reside in the imioe-' 
diate neighbourhood of them. 

Those^ however, who are more iiftmedi* 
ately, and, from their business, more con- 
stantly exposed to the action of efBuvia 
from such masses of putrid animal matter, as 
from necessity must always be pre^sent in 
the shambles, do not, in general, suffer ma- 
terially from its effects. It must be allow- 
ed^ however, that their frequent witnessing 
such scenes of cruelty as are constantly ex- 
hibited there, must harden the heart, and 
destroy every benevolent feeling. 

It is well known, that those accustomed 
to blood and slaughter, and to behold the 
pangs and agonies of death, even among 
brutes, not only view them without coo^ 



281 



cern, but with ease and satisfaction. Thid 
has at length a tendency to harden the 
hearty and to obliterate every tender feeling. 
There is not a more undoubted truth than 
this. The removal of this nuisance ought^ 
therefore^ by common consent, to be made 
t6 the suburbs of the city, where it can 
less affect either the health or morals of the 
people. 

Instead of this, however, I am sorry to see 
that an addition has lately been made to this 
building, which, while it will cause an ex- 
tension of the putridity, must vitiate the at* 
fBosphere, and consequently cause disease. 

With a little more attention to the inter- 
fial police of Edinburgh, it might certainly, 
from its local situation, be made not only 
one of the most cleanly, but one of the mos|: 
beautiful cities in the world. 

I by no means approve of planting im* 
tnense masses of wood in the immediate 
neighbourhood of any city, but surely a suf- 
ficient quantity to make it a little more pic- 
turesque, and thereby take from its fields 
that sameness which fatigues the eye, is 
extremely proper, particularly when fields 
^n be found, appropriated perhaps to no 
other use. There are, for instance, several 
parts on Arthur*s Seat and Salisbury Craigs, 
where small plantations might be madei of

POLICE FOR ARTIFICIAL CAUSES. 



Sect. L-^PoUce for Construction of Houses 

in Edinburgh* 

In all large cities, streets intersecting each 
other at small distances ought to be adopts 
ed ; by this means, ventilation would be 
more perfectly performed, than where such 
measures are overlooked, or where ventila* 
tion is more owing to accident than design. 
No crowding of houses, therefore, ought to 
be permitted ; but a space should, on the 
contrary, be left between each, and this, 
with the frequent intersection of streets^ 
would contribute much to the ventilation 
of the city.

The inhabiting of cellars, in which a gteat 
proportion of the lower classes dwell, im- 
mersed in darkness, and in filthy and damp 
situations, where they breathe impure, stag- 
nant, and enfeebling air, ought to be a|tered 
or entirely prohibited. 

On a hasty consideration of this jsubject, 
it might appear proper to prohibit all house$ 
of the above description fropi being occupied 
at all ; and indeed, although this would, 
particularly to the proprietors, seem rather 
a severe decree, yet it certainly would be 
the most efFectual in promoting the public 
welfare. Another view of the subject may 
be suggested, which will appear less severe, 
and at the sametime perfectly practicable, 
without either the country or individuals 
suffering very severely. 

These houses might be purchased by Gro- 
vemment at a very reasonable price, and 
there would be few of the apartments bat, 
by their direction, might be rendered fit for 
some use or other, such as cellars, stoae- 
houses, &c. ; and these being let at a mode- 
rate rent, would produce good interest for 
the purchase-money, 

I am aware, that the present proprietors 
would most pointedly object to this propo- 
sal ; for their views being in general of a 
more contracted nature, they are perhaps 



285 



litUe interested in the health and comfort of 
the community in general. The rents they 
derive from letting these miserable habita- 
tions, are often very great, frequently from 
0,0 to 40 per pent, for their purchase*money ; 
imd I have even been assured of its going 
considerably beyond this. From political 
-motives^ however. Government ought to 
adopt such means as seem most beneficial 
to the nation in general; and their next 
consideration ought to be, how the indivt* 
duals that may have suffered during the ful- 
filment of these plans, are to be compensated. 
The propriety of this will appear at first 
sight ; indeed the health of individuals in 
any country is a paramount and most impor- 
tant consideration* 

An improvement in the external struc- 
ture of houses in Edinburgh, seems to me 
much wanted, and one which ijiay be made 
with little or perhaps no expence to the 
proprietor. I allude to the building a 
^rnall parapetj similar to those used in Lon- 
don and elsewhere, rising a foot or eighteen 
inches in a perpendicular direction with the 
side* wall of every house above the termina- 
tion of the roof where it joins the side wall. 
Thus, slates, pans, or loose stones, would 
be effectually prevented from falling upon 
^he streets, which, during the violent hur- 



a&6 

ricanies with which we are oflen visited, is a 
very frequent occurrence, endangering the 
safety of the inhabitants. Besides, i» the 
present state of these roofs, there is hothing 
more painful to a feeling mind, than to ob-^ 
serve upon them slaters or chimney-sweeps 
working at their professions. 

Mr Nasmyth, landscape-painter, I may 
mention, has suggested some very ingenious 
plans for the improvement of the city of 
Edinburgh, which, if carried into execution^ 
would certainly not only add much to the 
beauty of the place, but contribute in no 
small degree to the health of its inhabitants. 

The object he seems to have in view, so 
far as health is concerned, is the more fre* 
quent intersection of streets, which would 
greatly contribute to the ventilation of parts 
where from their present state, that process 
is totally impossible, at least in such a de- 
gree as to render them tolerable. He 
has suggested many plans which would ren- 
der even the Old Town of Edinburgh per- 
haps equal, if not superior^ in beauty to any 
other in the world.

It were to be wished, that the Legislature 
would inflict a still heavier tax for the manu<^ 
facture of whisky, which would certainly, 
particularly in this quarter of the world, be 
the means of annually saving the lives of 
many thousands. The cheapness of this 
poisonous liquid, holds out an inducement, 
to its extensive use, at least to the thought- 
less part of the community, while the want 
of care, which from various circumstances 
is observed in manufacturing it, renders it 
very destructive to the cohstitution. 

This, perhaps, is almost the only mode 
of living in this part of the world, that calls 
aloud for the interference of our laws to 
prevent the perpetual devastation which it 
occasions.

Sbct. XV. '^Police for Marin&rs of Edin^ 

burgh. 

Till the late police-act was passed, there 
was perhaps no city in the world where the 
inhabitants were less disposed to riot and 
disturbance, particularly in the night ; but 
since that period^ they are actually much 
excited to it. Happily, however, this act is 
soon to undergo an alteration, when we hope 
the peace of the city will be again restored* 

Under the magistrates, and that respect- 
able body of citizens, the society of high 
constables, we always enjoyed most uninter- 
rupted tranquillity. I hope, then, the shame- 
ful examples of irregularity and disturbance^ 
which we have lately witnessed on various 
occasions, (should the regulation of that de- 
partment of police be again entrusted to 
them,) will stimulate them itfresh to the 
entire removal of such irregularities; and 
convince us, that unnecessary oppression^ 
by the institution of expensive and arbitraVy 
laws, is, at least in this part q{ the world, 
always hurtful, and never beneficial. The 
individual exertions of the late Mr James 
Laing, as contributing to preserve the peace 
of this city, were highly creditable to him- 
self, and will long be remembered with ap^ 
probation by many of its iuhabitants. ; 



290 



Daring high winds, especmlly in summer^ 
tvhich so frequently occur in the city of 
Edinburgh, and from the free passage that 
they have to sweep along the streets, the 
inhabitants, are, during the dry weather, Terj 
much annoyed by the dust; both within 
doors in destroying their furniture, and in 
preventing thern from passing with any de* 
gree of comfort along th^ streets. Why 
have we not water-carts similar to those 
used in London and other places, for the 
purpose of aillaying the dust } Surety the ex- 
pence attending such an equipage cannot 
he adduced as an excuse for the want of so 
great a convenience ; and if so, some incon-> 
sistency must exist, as there is much public 
expence thrown away in a variety of ways in 
Edinburgh, from which no visible benefit 
can arise, either to the country at large^ or 
to any individual of it* 

I know it has been urged, that want of 
water will not admit of such measures being 
adopted. This, however, is not true. We 
have plenty of water in our neighbourhood 
would we take the trouble to convey it to 
the city. With very little expence, pipes 
may be made to convey as much as would 
answer our purpose from the Water of Leith 
before it reaches the low ground above St 
Bernard's Well. Besides, there is much 



291 



water ,«t all times destroyed in the city by 
the carelessness of servants, which, if pre-* 
▼ented, would completdy answer our pur*- 
poses in the above way. It will not be be« 
iieved, that a city, situated like Edinburgh 
among mountains, can be at a loss for water 
for any useful purpose. 

In addStibn to this, we ought to have 
branchefS from the water pipes into all the 
various districts of the city, as well as into 
the ndghbourhood of those numerous re- 
ceptacles of filth ; and either a fine or impri- 
sonment ought to be inflicted upon those 
inhabitants who do not wash their nastiness 
into the common sewers, once a-day in win- 
ter, and twice in summer. 

Asa benefit to individuals, and for the 
purpose of accommodating those who wish 
for good servants, Mr Nasmyth has pro- 
Iposed that a house shall be chosen, kept 
by persons appointed for the purpose, as a 
rieceplacle for those persons, who either 
come from the country, or who may be 
brought up in Edinburgh, wishing to em- 
ploy themselves as servants of any descrip- 
tion : That in this house, while otherwise 
tmemployed, they shall ,work at those 
branches of service which they wish to be 
employed in ; and their merits shall be cer* 
tified when they leave it ; and that, during 



292 

their residence in such a house^ th^y diall 
be paid for their work^ and every variety of 
employment may be carried on in it for the 
benefit of the inhabitants, or such strangers as 
may visit the city. Thus the frequent eom« 
plaints against servants would be known to 
be either well grounded or false^ and those 
who hired any servant without a proper re* 
commendation from this place, would take 
them at their own risk, and would on no 
account be entitled to redress, even when 
faults were committed by such vagrant ser- 
vants. 

When I consider the number of acci- 
dents that during the winter months occur 
to skaiters, and others, in this as well, in- 
deed, as in every other part of our island, 
from the falling in of ice, it appears to .me 
veiy strange that tio ptany with which I am 
acquainted, has ever been adopted to give 
the drowning person a chance of escape. 
In the neighbourhood of this city, where 
•kaiting is a very favourite amusement, there 
is seldom a season that one or more persons 
are not drowned in the lakes, or lochs, as we 
call them. Yet this very necessary consi- 
deration seems entirely to have escaped the 
notice of those to whom we ought to look 
for improvements of this kind. 



90? 

« 

It IS allowed by every one, that most of 
the persons who ialLirictims in this way, do 
«o from want of sometliing to catch hold of 
^fter they have fallen, into the water., TJiey 
are therefore under the necessity or ehdea- 
vouring to lay hold of the edge of ttie bro- 
Jken ice, which alrtiost. always gives way, and 
Itbe ftpfortunate victim is plunged under it, 
irbm whjch Jie is seldoip able to extricate 
himself, * and therefore must perish^ His 
companions, too, in stretching but" their 
arms, or in holding long branches of trees 
to assist the escape of the drowning person, 
.often share the same fate. 

Jt occurs to me, that almost all these un- 
fortunate ,(^rcumstaiices may be prevented, 
by adopting a few simple precautions. If 
poles, iron rings, or such fixed points, were 
placed at various parts of the lakes, and 
ropes, or chains long enough to reach any 
part of these lakes attached to them ; by the 
assistance of those on the spot at the time;, 
there might always be afforded a very con- 
siderable chanx:e <?f escape for the drowning 
person^

INTRODUCTORY REMARKS. 

That the metroporis of the British fim- 
pire is the most extensive^ and the most po« 
puloiis in the wprld^ sufficiently testifies th^ 
importance of which a rational system of 
medical police must be to its inhabitants ; 
and that these iithabitants are the richest, 
the most humane, the most generous, is a 
sufficient ptedge th^t they will surmount 
whatever diffieulties may attend its execu- 
ttOQ. The narrow lanes and crowded bons- 
ai of this vast city, th6 number of manufac- 
tories and occupations of every kind produ- 
cing effluvia which taint its atmosphere, and 
the low situation and immense extent of the 
city permitting little ventilatioUj must afibrd 

T 2 



2g6 

the sources of innumerable diseases. To a 
great and liberal peofde, then, it is not suf- 
ficient to erect hospitals for the reception 
of the diseased, it must be incomparably 
more congeniar to the feelings, because 
more rational and more humane, to prevent 
their eitistence. And who that reflects for 
a moment, will doubt the possibility of re- 
moving such a source of contamination' as 
is to be met with in some of the streets in 
St Gileses parish, of the courts and alleys 
adjoliiirfg to Liqt[5fpoft?f Street, Hog-islarid, 
Tummile Street, Saffron- hill. Old Street, 
Whitecross Street, Grub Street, Golden- 
lane, Petticoat'lane, Lower East Smithfield, 
some parts of Upper Westminster, and seve- 
ral streets of Soulhwark, Rotherhithe, &c 
or the imperious necessity of performing this. 
It is not alone the miserable inhabitants ci 
these places who suffer from their filth. I 
had almost said it is scarcely they at all who 
suffer, , because they are habituated to their 
situation, but puch rather the inhabitants of 
the contiguous genteeler parts of the town. 
Self preservation, then, as well as humanity, 
<lemand their iustant removal or improve- 
ment.

The soil in the neighbourhbocf <)f Lbil^ 
don is generally fruitful abounding ^th' 
pasture and grain of all kinds produced in the 
island. The city of London affords svich 
plenty of manure^ and the conveniency of 
carriage is so great^ that this country may^ 
in a great measure,* be reckoned a garden, 
and 1$ perhaps the richest and most profitE^te 
ground in Britain. The soil of London it- 
telf is of the best kind for residence, being 
sound and dry; and the lower patrts are

freed from moisture by subterraneous sew* 
ers and drains. 



Sect. II — Climate of London. 

• < - ■ 

From a mean of the observations made at 
the house of the Royal Society, from 1 772 
to 1 780, it appears that the annual terope* 
rature of London is 52^ ; the monthly tem- 
perature as fellows : 



The greatest usual cold is S0(*, 
and ^iq)pens in January ; the 
greatest usual heat is 81% and

Sect. in. — Situation of London. 

'I, 

London, the nletrdpolis bf the whofe* 
tingdom, Ties in 51 degrees, 31 mihfter 
north latitude; the longitude hot being* 
reckoned, because it is made thie first mm- 
diari. It is admirably situated upon a gent- 
ly rising bank, in a wholesome soil, niixeJ 
with jB:ravel and sand^, upon the celfebrat^ 
fiver Tkames. The amphitheatre, which the 
metropulih forms on the north side of the 
Thames, nobly rising above the banks of 
th.jt river, is greatly enhanced in beauty by 
a chain of hillocks on the same sidei form- 
ing a second amphitheatre, entirely enclos- 



^(h 



ihg the first,' of which Hampistead, High'- 
gate, and MniweU HiH, are the most pro« 
tninent features. On the east and west arb 
extensive plains, stretching thirty miles each 
way along the banks of the river, and form- 
11)^ one of tfie most fertile vtillies on the 
sth^face- of the earth. While on the souths 
the kndscape is beautifully varied, from! west 
to east, by the high groutods of Richmond, 
Wimbledon, Epsom, Norwood, and Black- 
heath^ terminating in the horizon by Leith- 
hill. Box hill, the Riegate Hill», the Wn>- 
tham Hills, and Shooter's Hill. 
« The lands immediately surrqunding Lon- 
don, form a warm and interesting prospect. 
They consist chiefly of grounds cultivated 
hy the gardeners who furnish the public 
miarkets with vegetables and fruits, and ex- 
tensive nurseries of trees of various kinds, 
occupy a large portion in almost every out- 
let. 

London extends, from west to east, along 
the banks of the river /Thames, being dis- 
tant from the sea about sixty miles. It 
consists of threeprincipal divisions, the ci- 
ty of London, the city of fFestminster, and 
the borough of Southwark^ with their re- 
spective suburbs. The two former divisions 
are situated on the northern side of the 
I'hames, in the county of Middlesex, great 



m 



part of Ihem lying 4m hills, and fpronng^ 
gr^nd and beautiful lan^Iutbeatre Bound fcbe 
ivater ; the latter^ .on the; southern bank, in 
the pounty of Surry^ on level girotto49 ^nd 
anciently an entire morass* 
. The length; of Xiopdon, from Hyde Vvk 
corner to Poplar is about sev^n nailes, •eilEclft- 
aive of houses which on each side imfi ti^ 
principal roads to the distance laf aeveridi 
roiles in every direction; the breadth ia if* 
regular, being, at the n^rowest part, Wk 
more than two, and at the broiadeat, pjnioik 
four miles. 

The walls of the ancient city of hooAom^ 
included a space now in tbemid4)e,pf ihe 
metropolis, about one mile and a half m 
length, and rather more than half |i mile ia 
breadth. 

The C%, in its ^miliar pbras/^ meaiM^thtf 
trading part of the town^ extendiiog, with 
slight variations, from Charing-cross to th^ 
meridian of the Monument or the Tow^ 9 
but, locally speaJ^ing, it isconcfined by a oir- 
de, the radium of which would f eadi «boiil 
hajf a ^ile round St Paul's Catthedr^.

quantities of water conveyed into the h6mei^ 
eren the meanest, for domestic purposes^ 
afibrd the means of cleanliness, one of the 
surest companions of health. In a word, al- 
though the atmosphere of London is too fre^ 
quently moist, the weather often in extremes, 
and the change from one extremye to another 
frequently sudden, yet the metropolis may 
fairly deemed one of the most healthy in the 
world. 

The squares exhibit statues, but they are 
not of the first order. Thiese deficiencies, 
however, are beautifully contrasted by the 
plantations of Grosvenor, For tinan, Fitzroy, 
Leicester, Firisbury, Soho, knd Lincolnts* 
Inn squares ; and it is to be hoped that eve-* 
ry open sjpace of ground in London will, in 
the course of a few years, afibrd its inhabi- 
tants this species of summer promenade. 

The principal streets are wide and airy, 
and surpass all others in Europe, in their 
convenience for trade, and the accommoda- 
tion of passengers of every description ; they 
are paved in the middle, for carriages, with 
large stones in a very compact ' manner, 
forming a small convexity to pass the water 
off by channels ; and on each side is a broad 
level path, formed of flag stones, raised a 
little above the centre, for the convenience 
of foot-passengers.

,,^The whole of the norUi^rn side of ,St 

James's Fark^^ and the western extremity, 

^re very pleasing to the eye ; it is of an ob^ 

Ipng form, and nearly two miles in circuity 

The eastern extremity is occupied by the 

Horse-guards, the Treasury, and other edir 

flees, that do not produce an ill effect. But 

the south sidei.in which is the Bird-cage 
Walk, is. deplorable in its appearance. 

St Jameis Fqlace, and Park are situated 
hearthp westerj^ extremity of the town, on 
the side next the river, from which, at a 
small distance, it is separated by Parliament* 
€treet, and the site of Whitehall Palace. An 
inclpsure, called the Green Park, is a beau- 
tiful spot, gradually ascending from St 
JameVs,Park, which it immediately joins to 
Piccadilly, being separated from it by a wal( 
in some parts, and an iron railing in others. 

In summer, the eastern side of the Green 
Park forms a favourite promenade for the 
inhabitants of the metropolis ; and in fine 
weather, on every evening, and on Sundays 
in particular, is always extremely crowded 
with well-dressed company. At the north- 
east corner of this park there is a fine piece 
of water, which is supplied by the water- 
works of Chelsea, and forms at once a beau* 
(iful embellishment .and a useful reservoir.

From the magnificent bridges erected 
jBicross this river at London^ the most com^ 
plete views ;are afforded Qf the town ; and 
the immense number of boats; barges, and 
smaller vessels, which are always in motion^' 
affoi'd a spectacle of active industryy which 
can no where be equalled. . 

The Thames rises two miles Si. W. of 
Cirencester, in Gloucestershire; at Lech- 
lade, 138 mi}es above Xiondon^ it becomes 
navigable for barges of 80 or 90 tons : it is 
navigated by ships of 7 or 800 tons up tQ 
London-bridge^ aud by the largest ships to 
Deptford and Greenwich. The tide flows 
eight miles in four hours, as high as Rich- 
mond, -but the water is not salt higher thaa 
Gravesend, which is 30 miles bielow London 
Bridge. At I/>ndon» it is about 9 quarter 
of a mile broad, and at Gravesend, about a 
mile. Its whole course is about 200 miles. 

The southern banks of the Thames, con- 
tiguous to the bridges, for a considerable 
extent, are lined .with manisfactories and 
iwarehouses; such as iroQ-fipunders, dyers^ 
soap and pil- makers, glass-makers,, shotr 
makers, boat builders, .&c. 

It deserves to be remarked in conclumn, 
that notwithstanding :the very existence of 
London depends on the navigation of th^ 
Thame8> insCMuuch;. that if t^s river, wer^ 



i^endered unfiavigable, Lonaon would soon 
become a heap of ruins^ like Nineveh and 
Babylon, yet some of the passages of this im^ 
portant river below the Nore are suffered to 
become half-choked^ and almost impassable^ 
from the increase and shifting of sand-banksi 

The tide in the river flows 15 miles high- 
er than London ; but the water is not salt 
in any part of the town j and it is naturally 
very sweet and pure. The river i^ secured 
in. its channels by embankments, and^ when 
not swelled by tides or rains, is not more 
than a quarter of a mile broads nor in general 
more than 12 feet in depth ; at spring-tides 
it rises 12 and sometimes 14 feet above this 
level, and of course its breadth is encreased. 

The New River ^ in several points of view> 
is one of the most wonderful concerns in 
this metropolis ! Notwithstanding there are 
160,000 houses in London, yet, by means 
of the New River and London-bridge water- 
works, every house, and almost every roomy 
is most abundantly supplied with water, 
which is conveyed into them by means of 
leadeiLpipes, with unfailing precision and 
regularity^ for an expence to each house of 
only a few shillings per annum. 

The New River is a canal of nearly 39 
miles in length, cut for the sole purpose of 
conveying a regular supply, of water to the

metropolis^ hy Sir Hugh Mtddleton^ andfir^ 
opened in l<303« Its termination, called the 
New River Head, adjoins to Saddler's WdU^ 
and from hence the water is conveyed in every 
direction, by means of 5B main pipes of the 
bore of seven inches ; these convey the wa-: 
ter under ground^ along the middle of the 
principal streets ; and from them leadeo 
pipes, of half an inch bore, briinch to every 
bouse. From the property of water id ways 
to find again the level which any part of its 
body has attained, and as the New River 
Head is situated upon high ground, the wu^ 
ter rises in most houses into the second floors 
and in many into the third and fourth stories^ 
By means ofone water and two steam engines 
it is, however, forced to a still higher level, 
and thus noade to supply parts of the town 
which are situated as high or higher than 
the surface of the bason« 

Notwithstanding the interior of the king- 
dom is almost wholly intersected by canal% 
the Orand Junction Caned is the only one 
which, for commercial purposes^ has yet 
been extended to the metrc^olis. The rea- 
son may be found in the policy of govan- 
ment, which, to encourage the nursery erf 
seamen in the Newcastle trade, prohibits the 
introduction of coals into the metropolis \>f 
any other means^ notwithstanding Jxitter

CHAP. II. 



OF ARTIFICIAL CAUSES. 



Sect. I. — Of Construction of Houses in 

London. 

Most of the houses in London are built 
on a uniform plan. They consist of three 
or four stories above ground, with one un- 
der the level of the streets, containing the 
kitchens. In each storey is a large room in 
front, and in the back is a smaller room, 
and the space occupied by the staircase. 
This, however, is only meant as to the ge- 
neral class of houses. Those of the nobili- 
ty and persons of high fashion, though 
mostly plain and simple in the exterior, are 
internally constructed with all the variety of 
taste, elegance and convenience, for which 
modern architecture is distinguished. Wa- 
ter, as already observed, is conveyed, into 
almost every house, by leaden pipes, and 
preserved in jsuch quantities, that the inha- 
bitants have a constant and even lavish sup* 

u 3 



9H 

pJly. Nothing can be more commodious or 
cleanly than the interior of the houses ; and 
this character extepK^sf generally to lodging- 
houses, hotels, taverns, coffee-houses, and 
other place&« 

The population of London has diminish- 
ed almost one half during the last century. 
Many streets have also been widened, and 
many public buildings erected, whereby the 
nif0it>er qC houses ha$ been mucb le»iea- 
ed : and the housj^es which remain are not 
crowded with inhabitants, as they formerly 

TUere ate in London, aX least, one miliioB 
tiKP hundred and fifty thousand inh^hitaat^. 

This city does not excel in the number of 
buildings celebrated for grandeur or beau** 
^1 ; but, in all the priincipal streets, the 
metropolis is distinguished by an appe^abce 
of neatness ^nd comfprt. Most of tbje great 
st^eet^f appropriated to shops for r^taii 
ti!adj&, hai^e aii unriv9lled aspect of wealth 
a^d splendour* The sihops themtelvea are 
^ndsomely fitted up, and decorated with 
1f$ste; but the manufactures with which 
they are stored form their chief ornament. 
JX has been estimaited that London containa 
^\m^t 8000 streets, lanes, alleys and courts ; 
6q Snares, and i6o,Q0O houses, wairebouses^ 
aad. ^\hsv buildiQgs. 



&I5 



To ^lumerate the striking instances oC 
badly conatructed houses in this imfbense 
city, would be as impossible as it is unneces- 
sary. They are sufficiently known to every 
one ; and whoever, on arriving from the 
country, casts a single glance upon the 
countenances of the majority of its inhabi- 
tants, will be amply satisfied of thdr bad 
effects. I have already alluded to some of 
the most remarkable instances of this kind. 

I shall now then proceed- to apply these 
^observations to some of the most remarkabk 
of the individual constructions in London, 
vi2. prisons, hospitals, &c. Here I need not 
again protest against the introduction of 
fiucb places into the centre of populous ci- 
ties; the wretched effects of this practice 
. must be sufficiently obvious to every ob^rver. 

Newgate presents a fine uniform exterior 
to the west, consisting of two wings, the 
debtors' and felons' side, with the keeper's 
house in the middle. 

The north side, appropriated to debtors, 
;men and women^ consists of two court yards, 
which are far too circumscribed for the nu- 
merous inhabitants. The men's court is 
only 49 feet 6 inches by 3* feet 6 : The 
women's of the same length, and about half 
the width. The whole square is entirely 
surrounded by the wards, which rise three 

u 4 



316 

stories above the pavement^ and the wo* 
men's yard is separated from the men's by a 
walL 

The sides of the quadrangle are called the 
masters side, the cabin side, from the cabia 
bedstead3 in them, the common side, and 
the women's side. The apartments are 14 
in number, all of which, except one, which 
pccupies in length the whole side of the 
prison, are nearly of the same dimensions, 
23 feet by 15. The number of inhabitants 
in these rooms is from 12 to 20 in each. 
The largest room is sometimes inhabited by 
as many as 30. The debtor's side almost 
always contains 200, and sometimes as many 
as 300. The women have two wards of the 
same length, but not so. wide. During the 
Shrievalty of Messrs Smith and Phillips, 
these yards, and all the wards^ were repeat- 
edly lime-washed, and by these, and other 
means, Newgate was changed from a loath- 
some prison, dangerous to the health of the 
metropolis, to a state which may be quoted 
as a model for all similar places. Water is 
now plentiful, ventilators are introduced into 
jBvery window, and a general system of clean- 
liness has been substituted for one of the 
most disgusting filth. 

Here I cannot do better than quote, in 
his own words, the observations of one of 



317 



the gentlemen above alluded> to on this im- 
portant subject. 

" I had often viewed/' says Sir Richard Phil- 
lips, " these places, particularly the crowded 
:prisons of the metropolis, as mansions of mi- 
isery, in which were often united in the same 
person the whole dismal catalogue of human 
jwoes. In the ward of Newgate called the 
long ward, 35 feet in length, and 13 feet in 
breadth, there are usually 30 prisoners, 
which affords a breadth of only 26 inches to 
each prisoner, allowing space for door- ways 
and fire-places. The horrors of such a si- 
tuation, during the night, when the prison- 
ers are all locked up in their respective 
wards, especially during the heat of sum- 
mer, may be better conceived than describ- 
ed.'* — " They (the women also) were obli- 
ged, during the night, to pack themselves in 
•the same manner as the slaves are packed on 
board a slave ship, without bedding, and 
with no other covering than a single rug, 
exposed to the draught of four or five open 
windows." — ^^ While, as is commonly the 
case, there is only a space of J 8 inches in 
the women's ward of Newgate for each pri- 
soner to sleep in ; and the court which they 
are allowed to walk in during the day can- 
not afford sufficient exercise from want of 
room, or sufficient air from its confinement. 



r 



a 18 

it ifi scarcely td^ be expected that diseases tf 
the worst kind can be absent I under- 
rtand that when the number of prisoners 
(in Newgate) exceeds »x hqnifared, fevers 
have generally begun to sliew, themaelirea ; 
and in 1780, when the number ampuoted 
to nearly eight hundred^ a contagtow fever 
broke out^ and carried off fivf PC fix gl* the 
prisoners per day/' 

It is to be regretted thai similai* abuses 
are not remedied even to thm fXt^tA in 
all tl>e other nunierotts prisons* ia. the me- 
tropolis. 

It is agreeable to be abl^ to ti^m iiom 
these to houses destined for the: reeeptiefi 
(^the diseased, and for the alleviation ef 
their sufferings. Even some of them^ howv- 
ever, are not without faults in coaatroe^ 
tion. 

Among the moral features ot the metro- 
poiis^ is the multitude of its tnatitutioos for 
the relief of the indigent and the diseaaed 
in their various wants. Beside tmo hoq>i- 
tals^ supported at the public charge, one for 
the maintenance of invalid seamen, and the 
other for invalid soldiers, London has 0,2 
hospitals or asylums for the sick and lame, 
and for pregnant women ; 107 almshouses, 
for the maintenance of old men and women ; 
18 institutions for the maintenance of indi- 



3»g 

gent persons of varkms ptber (jie^rtptions ; 
17 dispensaries for gratuitously supplying the 
poor with rniedicine^ and medical aid, at 
their own dwellings ; 4i free schools, with 
perpetual endowments, for educating and 
maintaining 3500 children of bqth sexes ; 
17 other public schools, for deserted and 
poor children ; 1&5 parish schools, support* 
ed by their respective parishes, with the aid 
of occasional voluntary contributions, which 
on an average clothe and educate Coooboys 
and girls ; and in each parish a workhouse;, 
for main^aimog its own helpless poor. But 
jthi$ amplie list of pAiblic charities does not 
ia<elude the whole account. In the city of 
I.»ondon> belonging to its corporation, there 
are 94 public coqipanies, who distribute 
above 75,000U annually in charity ; and the 
inetropolis has beside a multitude of institu- 
tions, either for the education or relief of 
those who are actually distressed^ of a less 
public and prominent nature than the above, 
but which immensely swell the aid given to 
the indigent. It is difficult even to disco^ 
ver each of these institutions, many of them 
being in obscure parts of the town, and so 
little ostentatious, as to assume no public 
mark of their existence ; but the sums an- 
nually expanded in the metropolis, in chari* 
table purposes^ independently of the private 



330 

relief given to individuals, has been estimafe^ 
ed at 850,0001. 

Most of the hospitals and asylums were 
founded by private munificence ; of these, 
some are endowed with perpetual revenues^ 
and others supported by annual or occasion* 
a) and voluntary contributions. The alms- 
houses were built and endowed either by pri- 
vate persons, or corporate bodies of trades^ 
men. Many of the free- schools sprang from 
the same origin. The magnitude of several 
of the buildings dedicated to public charities^ 
and the large revenues attached to them, 
no doubt well deserve the stranger's notice t 
but that which graces the capital and the 
nation with more unequivocal honour, is the 
general administration of the public charitiea^ 
The wards of a London hospital do not form 
any painful contrast with exterior magnifi- 
cence, by inward filth and a niggardly hieasure 
of the aid afForded to the unfortunate inhabi* 
tants. The medical assistance is the best the 
profession can supply ; the attendance is am- 
ple, and the persons employed in that office 
as humane as its nature admits ; the rooms 
cleanly, and as wholesome as care can ren- 
der the dwelling of a multitude of diseased 
persons ; and the food is proper for the con- 
dition of the patient. In the almshouses 
and other buildings, for the maintenance of 



S21 



indigent old age^ and other decayed people, 
there is not only an air, hut a real posses- 
sion of competence and ease that cannot be 
too highly spoken of. From the free-schools, 
youth as learned, have been sent to the uni- 
versities of the kingdom, as from any of the 
most expensive seminaries for private tui* 
tion ; whilst all the public scholars receive 
an education completely adapted to the sta- 
tions for which they are designed. 

These buildings, however, are not with- 
out their faults, as just stated. It is above 
all, deeply to be regretted that most of them 
are in the centre of the city. 



Sect. II. — Of Occupations in London. 

London is not only the greatest commer- 
cial city in the universe ; but perhaps one of 
the first manufacturing towns. It is the 
largest, wealthiest, and most populous city in 
the world. Its trade is astonishingly great ; 
and it has been calculated, that the tran- 
sit of merchandise to and from London and 
its neighbourhood amounts yearly to at least 
220,000,CXX)1. Sterling. It abounds with 
markets, warehouses and shops, for all ar- 



322 



tides of necessity of lukury ? and, cmiainly 
there is no town in which an inhabitant, who 
possesses the universal medium of eaiehaiige, 
can be so freely supplied as here with the 
produce of imture or art, from every quiarter 
of the globe. 

The manufactures of London consist chiefs 
ly of fine goods and articles of elegant use^ 
brought to more than the ordinary degree 
of perfection, such as cutlery, jewellery, ar*- 
tides of gold and silver, japan ware, cut- 
glass, cabinet work and gentlemen's carria<» 
ges ; or of particular artides that require a 
metropolis, a port, or a great mart, for 
their consumption, export, or sale ; such as 
porter, English wines, vinegar, refined su- 
gar, soap, &c. Nothing surpasses the beau- 
ty of many of the former articles ; nor any 
thing the extent and value of the manufac- 
tories of the latter kind. A most extensive 
silk manufactory is carried on by the inhabi- 
tants of Spital Fields, Shoreditch and Beth- 
tial-green parishes; the persons emplbyed 
in it amounting to about 7000. In Clerk- 
enwell, about the same number of persons 
are occupied in the di^rent branches of the 
watch-manufactory. The coach - builders 
and harness-makers are rather numerous, 
and have brought their respective woi^s to 
such a high degree x}[ perfection as &r as to 



^23 

excedd) ii^ point of elegance, th6se made 
at any other place in the world. 

Of these numerous employments^ it will 
at first appear, th^t there must be many bad 
jas well as good consequences ; many effects 
prejadicial t6 the health' c^ the inhabitants. 
Not to mention the numerous accidents at 
such an extensive port, these manufactories^ 
and the sedentary or irregnlar habits with 
which they are Connected, will lead to the 
production of consumption, fevers, &c. 



SECTi III* — Modes of Living in London. 



There are perhaps but very few cities 
where every class of the people enjoy so 
large a proportion of the necessaries of lile 
as they do in London ; and the immense 
quantity of animal food made use of, is 
strong proof of this. It has lately been com* 
puted, that the number of bullocks annually 
made uie of is about 1 10^000, calves 250,000, 
sheep 7 f 0,000, lambs 250,000, hogs and 
pigs 200,000, besides a variety of other ani- 
mals. The following average number of 



324 



oxen and sheep sold even at Smitbfield, may 
convey some idea of the immense consump 
tion of animal food used in the metropolis. 
From 1750 to 1758, 75,331 oxen and 
623,091 sheep; from 1759 to 1767, 83^132 
oxen and 61 5,328 sheep ; from I768 to 1776, 
89,362 oxen and 627,805 sheep; from 1777 
to 1785, 99,285 oxen and 687,588 sheep; 
and from 1786 to 1794, 108,075 oxen and 
707,456 sheep. Gradually too, as the nuni>- 
ber disposed of encreased, their value^ and 
consequently their size, became greater. We 
find, that the average weight of oxen in IJOQ 
killed for the London market, is 370 lbs., of 
calves 50lbs., of sheep SSlbs. ; now, the 
oxen weigh 800 lbs., the calves 140 Ibs.^ 
the sheep 80 lbs., and lambs are generally 
about 50 lbs. 

Fish being very high-priced, there are 
comparatively a small number consumed in 
London ; certainly, however, this does not 
happen from scarcity, as they^may be easily 
procured on various parts upon our coasts, 
^nd conveyed to the markets at very little 
expence. It has been computed, that not 
more than 14,500 boats of cod and other 
sea-fish are annually brought to London 
Besides this, however, mackerel are some^ 
times both plenty and tolerable cheap* 



32jr 

* Poultry IS in prite most exorbitant ; and 
Consequently seldom used but at the tables- 
of the wealthy. Game is more commonly, 
met with, in consequence of the inter- 
course which exists between London and 
those parts of the country where it is 
easily procured. Venison is used in con- 
siderable quantity, and in general of good 
quality, as it is principally bred by those peo- 
ple at M^hose tables it is most commonly 
found. 

The quantity of milk used in London is 
immense. The annual number of gallons 
has been computed at 6,Q80,000 ; and for 
the purpose of furnishing it, 8,500 cows are 
kept. The milk furnished for use, is al- 
most always greatly adulterated with water, 
and, especially when the quantity of water 
put into it is likely to make it too thin, it 
is even asserted, that a considerable propor- 
tion of chalk is added to it. 

There are 10,000 acres of ground near 
London, cultivated for the purpose of sup- 
plying its inhabitants with vegetables, and 
3,000 acres solely for fruit. The annual 
sum paid for vegetables and fruit for th6 
London market, has been computed at about 
8,000,000. 

There are about 900,000 quarters of 

VOL. II. X 



S2& 

wheat annually used^ each contahiing eight 
Winchester bushels ; 800^000 chaldrons of 
coals^ each chaldron containing 30 bush* 
els; 1,775,000 barrels of porter, each bar« 
rel containing 36 gallons ; 1 1,1 46,7 B3 gal* 
Ibns of spirituous liquors and compounds ; 
OSflOO pipes of wine ; 21 ,265,000 pounds 
of butter ; and 25,500^000 pounds^ of 
cheese. 

The quantity of Porter brewed in London 
annually exceeds 1,200,000 barrels, of 36 
g^allons each ; the most considerably brewe* 
ties are those of fFhitbread, Brown, and C&., 
Meux and Co., Barclay and Cb., Hanbury 
and Co., and Brown and Parry^ each of 
whom brew annually, upwards of 100,000 
barrels. Next in order to these, stand 
Felix Calvert and Co.^ Combe and Co.^ Good- 
wyn and Co., Elliott and Co., John Calvert, 
and Co., Clowes and Co., &c. 

It has been falsely asserted, that the 
Thames water alone could make good por- 
ter ; but Whitbread's, Which is the largest 
brewery in London, is partly supplied from 
the New River, and partly from a spring in 
the premises. 

One of Mr Watt's steam-dngines works 
the machinery in Whitbread's brewery. It 
pumps the water, wort, atid^beer, grinds the 
malt, stirs the mash- tubs, and raises the casks 



327 



but of the cellars. It is able to do the work 
of 70 horses^ though it is of. a small size^ 
being ouly a 24-inch cylinder, and does not 
make more noise than a spinning-wheeh 

I may remark^ that when Dr Black dis- 
covered the principle of latent heat, he cer- 
tainly did not inlagine, that by its astonish- 
ing power, machines might be constructed 
by which the greatest manufactories in the 
world, such as the above, would be carried 
on ; and hence the immense importance of 
attending to any fact in sciehce, however 
little reference it may, in the first instslnce, 
3eem to have to the arts. 



SfiCt. 1^ .--^Manners of LondouM 

• , . ■ . . ■ \t 

To describe the manners of a city so ex- 
tensive, composed of classes so opposite to 
each other, and of inhabitants so nutnerous, 
assembled from almost every city and pro- 
vince in the world, v^ould be a task of tho 
Utmost difficulty to execute. 

In respect, however, to the labouring and 
trading classes of the inhabitants, they ar0 

X2 



ils 



generally industrious and frugal. Eixcep't 
in the case of long sickness visiting the fa- 
ther of a fartiily, (to which the wages of the 
labourer were never adequate) and the con*' 
fusion and distress which are peculiar to very 
hard times^ the dress^ appearance^ and man- 
ners, of the labouring people, are sufficiietit 
proofs that they are, in general, neither idle 
rior dissolute. The same may be generally 
said of the poorer sort of shopkeepers, who, 
• from the rate of their earnings, may be pla- 
ced in the rank of the labouring people. 
Male and female servants, in plain a(nd ho- 
nest families, may be also pladed in the above 
rank, and with a similar character. 

The generality of shopkeepers in the city, 
however, enjoy an affluence of circumstances 
independent of particular patronage or favour, 
from the fullness of customers in the market 
(as all that part of the metropolis ftiay be 
justly called) that gives them an indepen- 
dence of manners as curious as it is fortu- 
nate, A city shop-keeper acts out of hte 
shop, as if he had not a master in the world. 

Merchants, bankers, and all the higher 
orders of traders, are distinguished in man- 
ners from the last mentioned classes ; for, 
although they have independence iq their 
manners, it is not that blunt independence 



32p 



which marks the shopkeepers of the city, 
they being more in the habit of associating 
with people of fashion. In short, in respect 
. to almost every description of traders in this 
city, it may generally be asserted^ that their 
independence, and the ancient habits of 
their country, render their moral character 
equal, if not superior, to almost any other 
nation. It has been asserted, that the bus- 
tle of comjnerce, and the love of gain, h^ve 
tended to degrade and vitiate their minds. 
.In some instances this is protably too true ; 
but in general, with the power, they have 
acquired the resolution, to be just* Many, 
pay a v?ry gre^t proportion of them, would 
sooner suffer death than corpmit a frau4; 
being well aware, that such an act would at 
once be dishonest and destructive to them- 
selves. Hence honesty has become not on- 
ly a moral virtue, "but a political habit, dif- 
fusing itself very extensively. 

The superior orders of society in this ci- 
ty are for the most p^rt distinguished by the 
very highest polish in their manners, |n 
them y/e cap at once observe a degree of 
dignity and moderation, which preserves 
them from the flimsy style pf some small 
portion of the nobility or gentry, who de- 
grade themselves by perpetually mixing in 

x3 



330 

tlie maze of insipid folly and pernicious Iux« 
uty. Where such adulterated manners^ 
however^ are not indulged in^ an Englisti 
gentleman always conducts himself towards 
his inferiors with propriety and respect. 

The time of the higher classes is divided 
between the town and countf}'. In the first 
of these^ they are active, and quite free from 
tliat indolence which characterises many 
other nations ; and in the country, they are 
almost constantly in the habit of exercising 
themselves in the amusements peculiar to 
the place. 

There are, however, some points in the 
manners of this metropolis which, it has 
justly been observed, are disrespected by all 
parties. 

I principally allude to want of chastity in 
women of ratik, and to profligacy of men in 
a similar station* Such tainted characters 
are countenanced by the vilest parasites 
alone, and only by them when their fortunes 
enable them to gratify their luxury by ele-^ 
gant entertainments* 

Still, however, the manners of the gene- 
rality of the people are Open and generous, 
and there is an ease in their conduct which, 
in the less polished parts of our island, is 
Scarcely known. 

The mode of livihg in London, particular-

The improvident, and even the luxurious

cause of much misery among them.

himself warranted to state, that considera- 
bly more than bne-eighth. bf 9II the diseases 
in^ London, which take pla<;e^ in persons above 
20 yeari old, happen prematurely through 
excess in drinking spirits. ' 

The streets of London' are well paved and 
lighted ; there are few street robberies, and 
scarcely ever a midnight assassination. Yet 
it is singular that the watchmen are gener- 
ally oH and decfepid. If, however, a per- 
son be attacked or assaulted by thieves or 
others in the streets by night, the cry of 
fFatck^ three or four times repeated, will 
instantly bring up to his assistance several of 
the Watchmen, and the assailant is sddom 
able to effect his escape. 

Underneath the pavements are large sew- 
ers, which communicate with each house by 
smaller ones, and with every street by con* 
. venient openings and gratings, to carry off 
all filth that can be conveyed in that man- 
ner into the river. 

Besides the public baths, which certainly 
' are of the utmost service, there are oth^s

The plague, which had broken out mav^ 
times in Queen Eli2abeth*s reign, appean^ 
in 1 603, and made such dreadful devasta- 
tion, that between March and December, it 
swept away no less than 30,d6l peir^ns ; 
and though its greatest violence ceased the 
following year, it did not entirely leave the 
metropolis till 1611. 

About the beginning of May l66Sy one 
of the most terrible plagues that ever afflict- 
ed this or perhaps any other kingdom, 
broke out in London. The week in which 
the plague was first discovered, it Carried off 
nine persons, and spread an universal dread 
through every rank in the metropolis^ but 
the week after the sufferers being reduced 
to three, the fears of the citizens abated. 
In succeeding weeks, however, the number 
progressively increased, and in time it was 
not less than 470 a week^ The nobility, 
gentry, pnd principal citizens, npw fled with 



33^ 



|>rectpitatton) and in July the number kl* 
creasing to 2110, the generality of the hou8«- 
es were shut up^ and the streets deserted* 
In September the number of the dead 
amounted jin one week 106988 ; in the next 
week it decreased by nearly 400, but ag;aiti 
rose to 7165. 

The diseases which now occasion the 
greatest mortality in this metropolis, seem to 
be consumption^ (see Vol. I. p. 233.) and 
fever (see p. 254.) The first of these pre* 
Vails in general throughout the year, the 
latter always iti greatest severity during the 
fspring, or when the days begin to lengthen, 
but more particialarly during the summer 
months ; on this account it has beeti tenil- 
ed the sunimer fever. Toward harvest, it 
becomes tnore of a contagious and malig- 
nant nature, and is ustially checked when the 
frosts become severe. In the harvest, too, 
cholera and diarrhaea (see p. 273.) occur in 
practice. Convulsions, also, as it is genet* 
ally and vaguely termed, is a disease of great 
mortality, particularly among infants and 
children. As this disease^ so far as my bb« 
servation goes, is often an effect of other 
complaints, very often of water in the brain, 
(see. p. 238)> I have no hesitation in placing 
it under this head, and of particularly re- 
commending: the strictest attention to the 




336 

lymptoms which occur previous to such « 
. termination. Inflammatory complaints (see 
. p* aa,) are neither so frequent nor so severe 
:ui London as in the more northern parts of 
our island ; the most violent cases, howe- 
ver, are always to be met with in February 
and March. Catarrh, sometimes attended 
-with sneezing, and profuse expectoration, 
(see p. 227,) is to be met with throughout 
the year, but is most severe in the spring 
months. From the modes of living, too, of 
a great part of the inhabitants, liver and sto- 
mach complaints (see p. 205 and. 209,) are 
very common, entailing on many hundreds 
,8 life of the very greatest misery, which , 
from the tedious nature of these complaint^, 
^ often continues for several years. 

In the year 1650, the total number of 
deaths was 8,764. In 170O, they were 
19,443. In 1750, they were 23,727. In 
1708 and 1799* they were 18,000 in each 
year. And in 1800 they were 23,008, in 
1801 they were 19,374, in 1800 they were 
. 17,938, viz. 9215 males, and 8723 females.

POLICE FOR CAUSES OF DISEASE IN I-ONDONrf 



CHAP. I. 



:policb for natural causeit^ 



Sect. !• — Police for Soil. 

The soil in the neighbourhood of londori 
is certainly in a great measure prevented 
from producing diseases by the great culti- 
vation which every where is to be found 
near it. Were it not for this, the ground 
being for the most part but slightly elevat- 
ed, or indeed rather low-lying, the moisture 
which would in all probability collect in va- 
rious parts, would render the atmosphere 
less salubrious. 



»39 

Withinthe city, &c. much is efFected in 
the prevention of disease by the soil being 
kept moderately dry and healthy, by drains 
and common sewers in almost every part 

^rit. , 

From many of the lovpBgrounds about 
London, where draining them, * from their 
situation, would be attended with much dif^ 
ficulty, I hope, after what I have already 
stated on various occasions, I need only re- 
commend the rearing of those plants and 
treea which are most likely to absorb the 
noxious effluvia necessarily generated in such 
places. 



3*9 



Sect, II. — Police for Climate. 

In London, certainly the frequent inter- 
section of streets would be of considerable 
benefit, by pronipting ventilation, and con- 
sequently in removing the stagnant air 
constantly generated in the narrow streets^ 
close pent*up alleys,, ice ; but as It is not 
circulation alone that can purify such air, 
the chances of benefiting from the intersec- 
tion of streets, irc« in London, or in any 
overgrown city p£ a limilarnatttrQ, iBUSt^ 



340 

though certainly advantageous, be less so 
than in Edinburgh, where these sources of 
ventilation do not, as in London, waft the 
noxious vapours from one door into the 
next, but entirely remove them without the 

For the purpose of promoting ventila* 
tion, too, the local situation of London is 
inferior t that of Edinburgh ; still, howe- 
ver, we ought to adopt every measure for. 
the purpose of reaping every benefit from 
it which its situation, &c. will adrnit of. 
It thus becomes a matter of greater neces* 
sity in London th^n in Edinburgh to plmt 
shrubberies wherever it is admissible; and 
especially in all the lower lying places, where 
dampness prevails, the willow tree ought t* 
be planted. 



Sect. III.— Po/tc^ybr Situation^ 

» 

From the well constructed drains and 
sewers, and from the contiguity of the 
Thames to London, even the disadvantages 
arising from its being built almost on a 
plain, are greatly obviated. The police for 
this department, as relating to the health of 



341 



the inhabitants, does great honour to the 
magistrates ofthe city ; and were nearly the 
same efforts made in Edinburgh for the 
prevention of stagnant and putrid masses of 
filth, its inhabitants would soon be prevent- 
ed from regretting that improvements ne* 
cessary to the preservation of health are al- 
ways carried on with a tardiness which is 
quite unpardonable. 

After the plans I have in former parts of 
this work suggested for the improvement of 
this department of police, it may be unne- 
cessary for me to repeat them here, as those 
plans, with the reasonings respecting them, 
may be applied to London and its neigh- 
bourhood^ wherever they may be found ne- 
cessary.

CHAP. II. 



POLICE. FOB ABTIFICiAL CAUSES. 



Sect. I. — Police for Consitncttion of Hous^ 

in London. 



From a general vifew of the cnliilstnictioieif 
of houses in London^ it will appear^ thaC 
they are lesd cdlcutated to tRfe production 
of disease than those of many parts iii Edin- 
burgh. ^ Tn the former, as one house ii^ 
usually occupied, by one family, tfey are less 
crowded, and consequently less apt to ba^e 
the air within thent vitiated ; whiie in the' 
latter, we too often find various famtlie^ 
huddled together under the dame roofji 
which, in many places, must be highly 
ly destructive of health. StiU, however, the 
houses in many parts of London k>se muScb 
of the advantage which they derive frorti 
the above circumstance, by beitig • boUt 
in narrow and ill-aired lanes, where a pure 
atmosphere can never be found ; and where 



349 



the vitiatted habits of the miserable possessors 
encrease the evil, by suffering even unneces-^ 
sary accumulations of filth of every descrip* 
tion to exist on eveiry side of them. Atten- 
tion, therefore, to the removal of some of 
these causes of disease^ ought to be consi-^ 
dered as An object of the very greatest ira* 
portaiice. 

Another object denmnding our most ^eri* 
ous consideration, is the construction of thd 
prisons in this metropolis; and when we 
reflect, that not only their situation, but 
every circumstatice existing within them, is 
calculated bodi to cause and to propagate dis- 
eases of the most de^strnctive kind, it be* 
comes a neglect bf duty of the most unpar- , 
donable nature not to cfxert ourselves for 
their amendment. 

Instesid of these houses being placed in 
the very midst of this metropolis, why are 
they not, in prjeference, built on the highest 
grounds in the itnmediate neighbourhood 
of the city, or on the River Thames in the 
form df bulks. Were any of these pland 
adopted, the prisoners would ortly be depriv- 
ed of their liberty, while at ptesent, they 
are in a great measure deprived both of li- 
berty and of health. Whatever objecttoW 
may be urged against either of these pro- 
posals, they certainly would possess one de^ 

Y 2 



344 

cided advantage over the present state of th'A 
prisons in London, that their situation would 
admit of constant supplies of pure air. 

These circumstances respecting the situa- 
tion, &c. of prisonsT in cities^ seem ta me so 
plain and so practicable, that it amazes me 
the Legislative body of our island has never 
acted on them with regard to their formalioi^' 
&c«

After what I 'have stated under the ge- 
neral head entitled as above, and the few 
remarks afterwards made on the same sub- 
ject, under the same head, whe& applied to 
the City of Eldinbui^h, it may lead to un^ 
necessary repetitions to dwell at leng^ upon 
it now. I shalL therefore refer the reader 
to those parts of this work, and leave him to 
apply them to those occupations of London^ 
which, less or more, endanger the health of 
the persons employed in the prosecution of 
them.

The benefit which would certainly be ex- 
perienced, at least by the lower orders of 
society in London, by prohibiting the manu- 
facture of British gin and other poisonous 
6onlpounds> must be incalculably great. 
They are, I believe, principally formed of 
whiskey sent from Scotland and other places 
for the express purpose ; and when its qua- 
lity is so completely covered by the nume- 
rous articles which are nrixed with it, it is imr 
possible to know whether the original spirit 
has been good, except by its effects, which we 
find in those who are in the habit of using 
such liquors, to be very destructive. It has 
been observed, that when these baneful ar- 
ticles have been raised in price, so that it has 
been beyond the power of the common peo- 
ple to purchase them, at least in great pro- 
fusion, the comparative industry of those 
people has always been.observed to be great- 
ly augmented. The necessity, therefore, 
for legal interference to prevent such poi- 
sonous draughts from being so universally 
used, appears evident. 

From the keen disposition for mercantile 
pursuits which the trading part of the com- 
munity are allowed by every one to possess.^ 

y 3 



9i6 



the irregularity in their modes of living,^ 
owing to the very great length of tinae be- 
tween some of their meals and the very short 
time between others, is slowly but surely 
destructive of their health* Their digestive 
organs are at length, by these mean^ thrown 
into a state of derangen^nt, their victuals 
cease to ^nourish them, aud, at a larger or 
shorter period, from this caupe alone, disease! 
of a more formidable nature afiect them, 
which are almost always attributed to other 
causes, and thus n[)atiy thousands are aniiual'«> 
ly destroyed. 

With respect to many in the higher ranks 
of society, I may remark, that one acting in 
the capacity I now do, cannot do more thao 
merely point out« in a very general way, 
those irregularities in modes of living which 
are injurious to health. 

Their sumptuous meals at irregular hours, 
often but a short time before retiring^ to rest, 
however luxurious they may be, must be 
highly injurious to health. The clearest 
proof of it, is the very great derangement 
ia the digestive organs of such persons, often 
much greater than is to be met with in al<r 
most any other classes of society. 

Upon the whole, however, I believe the 
people of Scotland are more in the habit of 



^7 

using gseat quantities of inebriating liquori 
than the £ngltsl|.

Sec?. TSf. -^Police for Manners i>f London. 

Cleanliness, in every respect, I beiiev^ 
is as much, if not a more prominent feature 
in the character of the inhabitants in Lon- 
don, than in perhaps most other parts of our 
island. StiU, however, especially among the 
very lowest orders of society, nastiness, per- 
haps of every description, is carried to the 
greatest extent. Among them, therefore, 
were it but out of respect to those' in their 
immediate neighbourhood who may be ex* 
posed to the influence of such nuisances, they 
ought to be prohibited. Among such peo- 
ple, reasoning has no efiect, unless it be to 
irritate them and render them worse. It 
might therefore be proper, in order that the 
duties of a police may be rendered less ar-o 
duous, to encourage them by small rewards 
to lodge information of the; existence of 
isiuch nuisances, that these may be removed, 
and the offenders punished. In this way, 
we might be able to remove many source? 



348 

ol nastiness whicb^ unless some such inear 
sure be adopted, most continue to exist. 

Another species of cleanliness is cold or 
tepid bathing, which cannot be so convenir 
ently procured in London as in Edinburgh 
and many other places. Cold and tepid 
baths, therefore, ought to be established all 
over London at a moderate expeilce. This 
would not only add greatly to the comforts 
of the poorer and middling classes of society, 
but contribute greatly to the prevention of 
diseases among them* Indeed many of the 
higher ranks of society are blameably negli- 
gent of this mode of cleanliness.

CHAP. III. 

With respect to the cure of those dis- 
uses, arising from the foregoing causes, 
which I have mentioned as being most com- 
mon in London, I need only refer the read- 
er to the account given of that part of pur 
subject in this Volume, under its respec- 
tive heads. I jnay, however, remark, that 
inflammatory complaints do not in general 
admit of repeated blood-letting so freely as 
the same states of disease is^ by daily experi-

ence^ found to do in Edinburgh and its neigh* 
bourh od; nor is this practice found so often 
necessary in the former as in the latter place. 
Blisters, &c, answer better, and are general-* 
ly more successful. 1 hese differences seem 
partly to exist in consequence of the state 
of the atmosphere from the difference of 
latitude of these places, and partly from the 
great vitiation which it must suffer in con- 
sequence of various operations carrying on 
in that immense metropolis.

THE PARTICULAR PjUAN OF POLICE T<) 
PEi^ADOPTED ; AND THE REGULATION! 
CONNBCTio WITg IT. 



Philanthropic exertions must, at all 
times, be highly respected, from the purify 
of the motives to which they owe their ori- 
gin. But that which may, in some mea- 
sure, prevent their necessity, ought certain-* 
ly to claim some attention. 

Although, in many of the publications 
detailing plans for the suppression of con- 
tagion, there are to be found observations 
of the highest importance ; yet none of them 
seem to attach even as much importance k> 
the prevention or to the removal of those 
sources which produce disease, as to the cure 
of the diseases themselves, and to the main- 
tenance of those persons who may be labour-^ 
ing under them. This^ however, appears t« 



851 



me to be a secondary connderation ; because, 
while the sources occasioning these diseases 
wistt the cure of the diseases themselves is 
only prodtictive of temporary relief. 

The erection of houses for recovery from 
fever, for instance, without employing the 
propTer means for its prevention, is like 
throwing to foot of the list the officers who 
concluded the convention of Cintra, without 
haV^ing afforded them the means of avoid- 
ing it; 

Our main olgect, then, Is the prevention 
ofdisj^ase; and the cure ought only to be 
attended to, when the prevention cannot be 
effected. The detection and removal of the 

. i • ' 

causes of disease is in reality the true essence 
of medical police. Erection of hospitals for 
the cure of di^ases becpmes only a secon* 
dary consideration, as the necessity of suich 
measures entirely exists in proportion tQ the 
neglect of the form^ circumstances. 

Houses of recovery are doubtless 9/ the 
very greatest importance in the cure of 
contagious disease; in them a£ least, two 
thirds more are cured than when the 
disease is unchecked by such means, and al« 
lowed to run its course in the dwellings of 
the poor. When these fever houses are 
therefore of such importance, certainly the 
same philanthropic principle being carried 



852 



to the remoral of the causes of such diseas- 

I 

es would be incalculably more beneficial^ 
and would in a great measure even prevent 
the necessity of such Establishments. 

There can, indeed, be no question, that 
were more attention paid to arrest the pro- 
gress of disease among the poor, the neces- 
sity of hospitals would be less imperious ; 
in shortj the sums annually laid out for 
erecting and supporting such institutions, 
being appropriated to the removal of the 
sources of subh diseases, would ultimately 
prove a permanent, while the other only 
can, as already stated, serve a temporary 
purpose. 

There can, then, be no doubt, that were 
the Legislature to give that attention to the 
removal of the causes of disease which they 
ought to do, the neces^ty of hospitals, fe- 
ver-houses, &c. would be easily dispensed 
with. Under these circumstances, the lar^ 
gest city in Europe, would, I believe, be 
fully supplied with one hospital for such 
purposes. 

• The absolute necessity for greater atten- 
tion being paid to this subject, will appear 
evident from this, that on all occasions the 
constant expence attending every establish- 
ment for their cure, without attention to the 
removal of their cause, is enormous. Sa^ 



dsst 



laHes to individuals employed in these pla^ 
Ces, the expence of the different articles of 
clothing, of provisions, wine, medicines^ 
&c. IS continual and excessive; The whole, 
expence^ on the Contrary, for their preven- 
tion, principally rests in the salaries of the 
officers of police, and the trifling losses in- 
dividuals may sustain from th^ removal of 
what such officers may deem causes of dis« 
ease. 

Unless, indeed^ the most effectual means 
are adopted for the removal of the causes of 
fevers, in London, for instance, where at 
least forty thousand are annually affected 
by them, the expences attending the support 
of fever-houses for such immense numbers^ 
could not be submitted to by the public. 
Hence a police for the entire removal of 
these sources is, if we wish to effect any 
permanent benefit by our exertions, abso- 
lutely necessary. ' On a moderate calcuU^ 
tion, a fever-hbuse> where thirty patients 
unable to work at any employment, are sup- 
ported at the expence of less than 2s« 6d. 
daily, every thing included, will cost at least 
fifteen hundred pounds annually. Even 
such a sum annually expended for the pur- 
pose of employing proper officers to report 
to a committee the state of the sources 
which in every city cause perhaps twenty 



354 

titnes more diseases than those above sUt* 
ed, would, in a great measure, -be sufficient 
to remove both these- sources, and the disN^ 
eases which they occasion* 

In the pirosecution of such a plan, it will 
be necessary to attend to the following ob* 
jects; its detection, its Removal, the cun* 
of iilfected ly^rsohs^ and the purification of 
infected places. 

But before such measures can be adopt* 
ed as will render any institution of this kind 
pehnanently beneficial, the physical power^ 
as well as montl influence of the country^ 
must combine to enforce the salutary em^ 
ployment of such antidotes to infection a^ 
shall be deemed necessary and proper* And 
even then, it has justly been observed, that 
joint eitertions will scarcely be sufficient to 
overcome the influence of indolence^ igno- 
rance, habit, and necessity, which so geiie^ 
rally prevent the attenticm nec e ssary to pre- 
serve health, and to oppose the generation 
of disease. 

A council of health ought to be establish- 
ed, consisting of some erf* the principal mem-^ 
bers of the Legislature, some of the chief 
magistrates of each city, and several mecficd 
attendants ; and this body should be eri* 
trusted with such powers as might enable it 
to see all its orders executed with impartial 



S5» 



justice^ M tiifell as that no unnecessary hard- 
ships be, under any pretence^ inflicted. 

This body ought to appoint inspectors ot 
thfe medical profession, whose business it 
should be, not merely to see whether the 
i-ules for the prevention of di^ase be carri* 
ed into eitecution, but whether they be ade^ 
quate to pfoduce the effect intended. 

The measures to be Adopted for this pur^ 
pc^e cannot be effected without interfering 
with private property and domestic arrange- 
ments, while much expence must necessarily 
be incurred. A rational plan, then, of me>^ 
dical police cannot therefore be carried in* 
to eiecution Without the flid of the Legis* 
lature. 

A fleries of pkih and obvious instructions 
for the poorj in .pairticular, should be drawfi

ment inflicted for inattention to them. 

The officers of medical police ought, theliy 
a^ already said^ to consist of a sufficient 
humbef of medical men for the cure of dis- 
ease^ and a nmnber of others, whose duty 
it should be to superintend the state of thosa 
parts where diseases are most likely to be ' 
propagated.

be comjiletely remedied ; that the vitiatdfd 
climate iilay be purified, and prevented from 
again being put in that state, since we find 
that different countries, according as these 
measures are adopted or neglected, are heal- 
thy or otherwise; that all low lying and 
damp situations should be abandoned^ and a 
preference given to those of moderate 
height. 

The inspectors should also see that tht 
size of the houses, and of the individual 
apartments, be properly regulated, and the 
size and situation of the doors, windows^, 
and chimneys, be strictly attended to, and 
no paper or cloth be used for covering the 
walls of rooms, particularly among the low-*- 
er orders of society ; for they serve greatly 
to confine a great proportion of noxious ef- 
fluvia ; and that areas, yards, and courts, be 
large and well ventilated, and the^ lanes, al* 
leys, &c. be wide in proportion to their 
length, and the number of inhabitants they 
contain : That all occupations, where the 
health is likely to be injured, be strictly at- 
1:ended to, so that the dangers inseparably 
connected with them be not unnecessarily 
augmented by want of cleanliness, &c. : 
That the modes of living, particularly among 
the lower orders of society, be in some mea- 
sure examined^ and regulated with that spi^*

rit of moderation which wooM so6n put to 
silence the complaints c^ those who fell im- 
mediately under such a scrutiny, and cont-' 
vince them^ that it was ftot by the iron rod 
of oppreesioQ they were to be swayed^ but 
by the soft and persuasive advices of iriend- 
ship : That the extensive department of man* 
nets be strictly attended to in every, rank, 
and if found vitiated, nasty, and consequent- 
ly productive of disease, be prohibited, and 
even puntshed* 

Before the complete removal of contagion 
can be efiected in large cities, the entire de- 
struction of many houses must be absolutely 
necessary ; but still more than their expence 
is daily consumed by the inactivity of the 
diseased, and the money necessary to pro- 
cure medicines, &c for their recovery. 

The public at large, out of respect to 
themselves, as well as others, should there- 
fore be solicited to give the earliest informa- 
tion of the existence of contagion, that its 
ravages may be suppressed, and its causes 
instai^y removed. 

The additional expence which every fa- 
mily is put to where contagious diseases have 
made their way among them, must especial- 
ly have been severely felt by many, whose 
income is unable to support such expence, 
while the^ Bituatioa in life^preveuts them

from sending their sick to an hospital. A 
tax, therefore, imposed on individuals ac- 
cording to their income, or their situation 
in life, for the purpose of suppressing the 
sources of such disease, must not only be 
productive of a considerable ^saving to all 
parties, but also of the mos( marked ad- 
vantage in the preservation of the health of 
those whose lives may be widely useful to 
society in general. This, while it would be 
a species of taxation to which none could 
object^ would at the same tim(e leavje the 
most favourable impression on the public 
mind. It would, in fact, illustrate that 
which ought to be the very nature of all 
taxation^ namely^ a public contribution for a 
public service. 

For the prevention of disease^ and the 
consequent inutility of hospit^^^ I may 
again remark^ that the late ^>r. Currie 
ingeniously observes, that ^^ this is a pro* 
spect in which the philanthropist might in- 
dulge with more safety, if he could calculate 
with equal confidence on the wisdom as on 
the power of his species." 

It is not, then, by any partial exertion on the 
part of the L^slative body of our country, 
that we are to expect those important bene- 
fits to which I have alluded. A combined 
and determined efibrt, conducted with the 



359 



greatest energy and vigour, and under the 
immediate observation of those who are 
previously known to possess the ability to 
execute such important duties, can alone 
effect such an important purpose. 

Till men of liberal principles, who may 
fill offices of trust more for the purposier 
of benefiting their country than that of en* 
riching themselves, are charged with th^^ 
fulfilment of such duties as I have frequent-^ 
ly alluded to, they never can be performed j 
and while l!hese important duties are over- 
looked, th^ motives of those in power can-; 
not be misunderstood. 

Resolutions upon too contracted a plan, 
and efforts' of an imperfect nature, must be 
productive of benefits much more limited 
and ineffectual than when these plans are 
fully ader^t^te to the necessity for their in- 
stitutioii^l In the former case, they never 
answer the end for which they were formed ; 
for while, in one part of a city, we are using 
every effort to destroy contagion, in the 
other parts it is daily gaining ground; in 
the latter, every good purpose for which 
such institutions were made is reaped from 
them; while the comparative expence of 
these two states, where the benefits arc only 
apparently, and where they are completely 
reaped, is extremely trifling. 



966 



AlthoDgh, perhaps^ under the best regu« 
lated police for the preTentioa of disease^ 
we may not entirely effect our purpose ; yet 
surety, by these means we may lessen dis- 
eases both in number and in severity. 

i am conscious, that my present proposals 
of improrement will, in many instances, 
meet with the most violent opposition; that 
the severest strictures from interested and 
angry parties, will, from selfish motives, or 
private malevolence toward the author, be 
secretly poured out against them, virhich 
those who make a trade of such vile practices 
well know has much effect on the world in 
general. But, if I obtain the approbation 
of those who are well-wishers to the suffer- 
ing part of the community ; who trace hu- 
man distress into every cornier, visit it in eve- 
ry hut, and who, with pity, see the merci- 
less hand of pestilence press heavy, often on 
the most valuable lives ; though such are al- 
ways in the minority, I shall reckor* their 
approbation a sufficient re<;ompence for my 
labours : Nor shall I conceive that my en- 
deavours have proved unavailing, if I should 
only be able to excite to the prosecution of 
this important subject, gentlemen who may 
happily possess more ability to command a 
successful result to their patriotic labours,

INTRODUCTION; 

kXHIBITING THOSE MISERIES OF MANKINJ0 
WHICH THE WORK IS INTENDED TO OB- 
VIATE, AND SKETCHING THE PLAN TO 
BE ADOPTED FOR THAT PURPOSE* 



The prosecution of enquiries, and the de- Import- 
tail of observations connected with the pre- inquiry. 
servation and the prolongation of human 
life and human comfort ^ have at all times 
been justly acknowledged to be subjects of 
the utmost importance. They have, how- 
ever, so far as I know, rarely been made the 
subject of a distinct inquiry, except by men 
who, from their complete unacquaintance 
with medical science, have either treated it 
in an imperfect manner, or enveloped it in 
such doubt> by evident contradictions^ as fb 
render an obedience to their rules impossi- 
ble, unless human health and comfort, the 
great objects of such an inquiry, were to be 
considered only in a very remote point of 
view. 

Considerations of this kind first instigated »iotiYe^of 

^ the Author 

me to undertake the present work ; but, 

a 



notwithstanding my most anxibiis wishes, I 
may, in many respects, have fallen short of 
my aim. Let it, however, be recollected, 
that even an attempt to investigate, and a 
Urish to point out improvements in, a subject 
of the greatest importance to mankind, can, 
from its extensive nature, approximate, only 
by gradual steps, to a state of perfection. 
Where no dangerous doctrine is inculcated, 
injurious either to the physical or the moral 
powers, and where probably more is deli- 
Tered, and that perhaps also placed in a 
clearer point c^ view, than has hitherto been 
generally done, feults of omissbn may be 
tiie more easily pardoned. 
Transitonr My oWect is the alleviation of human 

nature of • * . 

Life and aufierings, which certainly, from the cradle 
to the grave, offfst a subject sufficiently 
comprehensive. We are ushered into the 
world in the midst of lanientation, are too 
often torn from it in pain and in agony, and 
the vision of human life speedily terminates. 
But even when neither pain nor agony in 
excess assail us, other indescribable sources 
of misery coavince us of the truth of the de<^ 
scription of life by our immortal poet,— ^ 

^^ 'Tis but a walking shadow ; a poor player. 
That f trutf and frets his hour upon the stage. 



Health.

And then it heard no more ; it is a tale 
Told by an ideot^ fiili of sound and fiiry^ 
Signifying nothing V 

We may, however, take a more scientific 
view of it. ** Let us contemplate," sayd 
Covicr *, " a female in the prime of youth 
«nd health. That elegant vduptuous fbimi, 
~that graceful flexibility of motion,— -thit 
gentle warmth, — those cheeks crimsoned 
with the roses of delight, — those brilliant 
eyes, darting rays of love, or sparkling with 
the fire of genius, — that countenance, enli*- 
vened by sallies of wit, or animated by the 
glow of passion, seem all united to form a 
most fascinating being. A moment is suf- 
ficient to destroy this illusion. Motion and 
fiense often cease without any apparent 
cause. The body loses its heat ; the mus^ 
des become flat ; and the angular promi«- 
nences of tiie bones appear ; the lustre of 
the eye is gone ; the cheeks and lips are 
livid. These, however, are but preludes of 
change still more horrible. The flesh hd- 
cMie^ successively blue, green and black. 
It attracts humidity^ and while one portion 
evaporates in infectious emanations^ another

dissolves into a putrid ^liies, which is also 
speedily dissipated. After a few short days 
there remain only a small number of earthy 
and saline particle^. The other elements 
. are dispersed in air and in water^ to enter 
again into new combinations/* . 

It is thus that Cuvier endeavours to prove 
that life enables us for a short period to re- 
sist the influence of external bodies. 

^^ It was indeed impossible * for us not 
to feel the frequent necessity of deploring 
the early fate of those we loved. We, there- 
fore, thought we perceived this principle ope- 
rating, when the evident influence of exter- 
nal causes, or some mysterious agency, seem- 
ed to drive the noblest results of life, intellect 
and genius, from the philosopher and states- 
man, who ha(d> by 4he diffusion of truth and 
resistance to arbitrary power, preserved the 
liberties and aggrandized the happiness of 
nations; we. thought we perceived their in- 
fluence, when imagination's powers fled from 
the poet whose song had once almost con- 
ferred new life on the heroes of ancient 

k t 

timea ; we thought we perceived their in- 
fluence when the phenomena of vital action

diiMi{)pe«'ed in the body of the patriot hero 
in whom they had once developed the ru:^ 
blest specimeii of that generous love of so- 
cial life, which induced . him to devote. his 
existence to his country's weal.-; we thought 
we perceived theic influence .'when those 
magic charms abandoned the lovely feinale^ 
whose powers had once excited, even from 
the philosopher, those splendid epithets that 
ranked h6r. with the other objects of his ado* 
ration^-^-celestial truth and godlike genius ; 
which had obtained, even from the poet, 
those wonderful strains that at once immorta^ 
lised him and ther object of his song ; which 
liad commanded, even in the hero, those 
glorious devotions which, for far too short 
a period, illustrated the ever. memorable days 
of chivalry.— rWheri thojse eyes, ^ whose soft 
languor had fascinated every beholder ; those 
cheeks, where life had often spread the crim- 
son veil of love, — when these were gone, those 
eyes were dim arid sunk ; those cheeks were 
pale ; those lips were livid ; that bosom de- 
pressed ; that form rigid and icy cold ; when 
all had thus assumed the darkest and most 
frightful hiies,had gradually lost cohesion md 
become one mass of horrible putrescencei 
whose infectious effluvia now threatened de- 
struction sU^most welcome to those who once 
adored the animated being, — ^it was sparcelv

wc lake of a State as a blessing, we yet, by the most 
evident and thoughtless omisnon, permit 
our health to be Masted by the silent and 
insidions, yet sure precnrsors of disease, and 
never sufficiently appredate its comforts till 
we have irremediably lost it,«f*tiU they Imve 
robbed us of the power of proaecutmg our 
profesnons or emfdoyments, the very means

by disease, rendered completely incapable of 
happiness or comfort* Let our means bq

we attempt to enjoy them : '

No rapture swells the breast, no poet singSj 
No more the maids of Helicon delight. 
■ ■ — 'tis this adorns the rich ; 
The want of it is poverty's worst woe." 

When deprived of health, the rich man is 
poor indeed; loaded by disease, even the 
tyrant is tame, the ambitious are humble,

plied by useless treasures, which onoe afford^ 
ed the only enjoyment they were ever capable 
ofreoeiving, while the abuse of them en<* 
fetbled their frames, and prepared them {at 
the attacks of disease. 

The bills of mortality^ however defective 
and inaccurate, demonstrate the awful truths 
that few of the human race die of old age^ 
or natural decay ; and that by far the greater 
proportion are cut off by diseases induced by 
want of care, and propagated by want of at^ 
tention both to themselves and their iaferi^

Let us then view the miseries of our fel- The awful 
low creatures as induced by disease. We wSch^our 
all know, that wherever ignorant and needy neglect in- 
beings are crouded together, there is at once 
engendered and fomented almost every kind 
of disorder, vice, vexation and disease. AU 
though, however, this be generally believed, 
«nd tacitly acknowledged by all, it is never

understood in its true meaning ; but by those, 
few physicians who devote their lives to such 
philanthrophic pursuits. By them, indeed,- 
if they perform their duty, is seen miich of 
human want and. human misery, the exist'% 
ence of which the' World in general is utter-^ 
}y incapable of conceiving. 

Various circumstances, sucK as the disr 
turbance of mind, and the terror arising to 
the sick poor, : from the shocking view of 
^ach others 5ufFerings> their agonies, their, 
ravings, or their dying groans, in the large 
wards of a crouded hospital, for instance^ 
all plead strongly with humanity for their 
relief. Sometimes, however, indivicbial^, 
crowded together, are to be found, in .cest- 
tain situations, not only in a state of disease ; 
but where moriality ceases to exist amottg 
them. Such is often the case in our jails. 
'^ Their miseries,*' says Dr Johnston, " are 
not half their evil • they are filled with eve^y 
corruption which poverty and wickedness 
can generate between them; with all the 
shameless and profligate enormities that ca^ 
be produced by' the impudence of ignomi- 
ny, the rage of want, and the malignity of 
despair.* In a prison the awe of the

public eye is lost^ and the power of fhepul^i 
lie law is spent ; there are few fears ;' thers* 
are no blushes. The lewd inflame the lewd^' 
the audacious harden the audacious. Every 
one fortifies himself as he can agamstlur 
own sensibility ; endeavours to practise oit 
others the arts which, have been practiced 
on himself |^ and gains the kindness of hia' 
associates by a similitude of .manners.*"^ .. 
. But when to this, which often happens, is 
added the. malignity of some of our cohta«^ 
gio us diseases, the: misery of such a situation 
can better be conceived than described. In 
thousands of the most wretched hovels, the 

m 

inhabitants are scarcely able to procure the 
most common necessaries of life^-^

by the door. Their sheets, if they have any 
on their beds, are not changed oltener than 
thrice a- year; their blankets if any, are ne- 
ver scoured ; and if their bedn are lurnished 
■with curtains, instead of being clsaned, they 
are suffered from time to time to drop in pieces 
from the bed. Certainly no distinct idea can 
be formed of such wretchedness, by those 
accustomed to live in comfortable dwellings. 
Some lie upon dirty rags ; others upon old 
and musty straw; others even upon the bare 
floors, — often damp and unwholesome. In 
short, the poor are obnoxious to every thing 
that can generate, diffuse, and perpetuate 
contagion ; and, at the same time, to all 
those circumstances which render it most 
destructive. 

Nor is this all, for while the frame is sub- 
ject to physical circumstances so destructive 
of health, irioral causes combine to irritate, 
to depress, or to vitiate the mind. The 
bitter railings of the discontented, the fierce 
quarrels of the passionate, the mad impreca- 
tions of the blasphemer, the wild riots of 
the drunkard, even the boisterous merri- 
ment of the gay, if mirth may here be found, 
the piteous cries of infants, the complaints 
of the aged, the moans of the sick, the la- 
mentations of the distressed, preclude the 
possibility of that repose which is necessary 



XVL 



both for the body and the mind. Who 
..would wonder that intoxication^ ev<en to 
Stupefaction, should be considered as an d>- 
solute refuge from ^uch <boncentrated misei- 
fy ? SplHtuous liquors, the poisonous c6f- 
dial of grief, while they dissipate the hours 
i>f necessary labour, inflame the passions^ 
$nd, by undermining the strength, render 
them unfit for future exertion. The inevi* 
table consequence in men is riiin^ and their 
yifmneBg- reduced by necessity, and provoke 
ed by neglect or brutal treatment, are drtven 
to prostitution, whilst their deserted oS* 
spring are impelled to beg or ^teal. 
'A state of prostitution, which has its sole 
origin in corruption of morals, excites in 
the mind of the beholder involuntary feel- 
ings of 'detestation and horror; but when 
tbaS) which not unfrequently happens, is the 
expedient adopted for the support of disease 
ed parents, or a numerous family, the fedi^ 
ings of pity must predominate in every 
mind* ' 

But let us examine the progress of such 
^calamities. Many of those thus circum- 
4itanced, who, but for such sufferings, might 
have been good members of society, are ren^ 
dered completely the reverse by their situa^- 
tion« While domestic comfort flies, poverty 
^ppears^on every side ; and, while the moral;

of the eiiiWren are destrc^g, they are co- 
vered with mgs ; cleanliness is entirely gi- 
ven up and forgotten ; and the whole fanii^ 
lyi« at once involved in dirt ar?id in misery. 
Tlie husband^ who no longer finda pleadurii 
or satisfaction at home, foolishly efldeavbtirs 
to seek for them at the ale-house ; and the som- 
ber man thus insensibly becomes adrunkistrd. 

By habits of this kind, it-wilt be fouri^^ 
that an amaxing number of lingcfhUg', yi^ 
fatal diseases are produced itir coAsequentse 
6f them ; and that many thousands ;drag 
tmt a miserable existence, unable either 16 
continue- their former practices, or to recp^- 
Ver from the effects produced on the wither- 
ed afkJ emaciated fabric. ' '^ 

In the mornings, the mouth becomes dry 
and disagreeable, the sleep ceases to be re* 
ffeshing, and; the appetite for food failis; 
The hands shake, and the Wretched sufi^«> 
er fires again to the bottle for temporary 
relief; the face is bloated ; the breath is hor^^ 
ribly disgusting, and a stench issues from the 
whole of the body; the features are enlarged 
and inexpressive ; the eyes assume a glazed 
appearance, then become fixed and stupid^ 
and at last watery and tender; their express- 
eton is extremely unpleasant, and at length 
they seem considerably protruded irom 
their sockets ; the whole frame becomes e^ 



ther Skhhy &nd* soft, or emaciated and hug* 
gard in appearance; the extremities ane 
shrunk and meagre, the feet unable to sap*- 
port, the fimbs; and the knees unable to 
^support the body. 

. During this period, the internal chatiget 
are not less striking than the external ap- 
{>earance8. The liver principally becomes 
afiected ; and a sensation of disagreeable 
faeat and. oppression is felt about the region 
of the stomach ; while the bowels, in parti^ 
cular, . and the system in general become 
ettremiely disordered. The disease of the 
liver atill . encreases ; heavy gnawing pains 
iire felt in it, distressing nausea, a perpetual 
inclination to vomit, or vomiting itself be- 
come ..frequent;, violent spasms often seize 
thft; stomach, and contiguous visoera, and 
either obstinate torpidity of the bowels, €r 
profuse: and debilitating diarhaea, are the on- 
ly alternatives of the patient. 
• Neither is their state . of mind less 
changed. Its sensibility, and all its deli- 
cate .eitiotipns, become gradually blunted. 
Those qqalitie^, which at any time may 
have rendered them valuable in privatie 
or in public lif^t are neglected and disgra- 
fed. Their society, ceases to be coveled, 
they become torpid, and mer/e loulicasts up- 
«nt(;(|if^.jQar^h. Their mind. }>ecoiB^es; eqiiallj^ 



indifl^rent to every thing past or future t 
bope is extinguished within their breMt, 
and even the prolongation of existence be* 
comes a matter of indifTerence to them* 
Thus the wretched and almost unpitied suf* 
ferer lingers out a few tedious years, equally 
insensible to every kind of enjoyment^ but 
tiie prospect of again reducing himself to a 
•tate of insensibility by intoxication. 
: Delirium at length ensues, and reacha 
aometimes its wildest state, though even 
without this dreadful addition, the victims 
of these disgusting habits become an intoler* 
dble burden to their nearest relations, who 
feel it impossible to pity them to the extent 
of their misery, because it can never be !re«- 
moved from their mind that they themselves 
have been the voluntary causes of their own 
anfierings* 

. Dropsy, in one or other form, at length 
supervenes, and theencreased bulk occasion* 
ed by it, added to the horrid and disgusting 
appearance of the person in every other re^ 
q)ect, exhibits a most shocking spectacle* 

' While slight convulsions now announce 
the termination of the scene^ the dropsy en-» 
ernases, the skin of the swoln litDbs he^ 
comes thin and tender ; at last it bursts,

<}eath as alow as his disgnsting habits hav€ 
been gradnaL 

But even if fortunately these should net 
be his haUts, nor this the termination oi 
the sceiM, it is impossible, under any simiiar 
circumstances, for the father of afamUy, far 
instance, to attend to the wants of his ofaft- 
dren, and they are consequently obliged eah 
ther to sted, or to sq^ply for assistance t* 
the pubKc. Thus, by degrees, they also be^ 
;Coaie more and more morally depraved, and 
^disease, in one form or other, does not fail 
to contribute its share to increase their suf- 
ferings. The whole family, improvident fat 
the future^ while their labour enabled tbefli 
to obtain the means of subsistence, periups^ 
in their most provident days, earning too 
little to admit of saving, every evil is now 
doubled. If the father be confined by dis- 
ease, the source of his &mily's support is at 
once cut off; if the mother be the persoa 
attacked, so much of h^ husband^s time it 
employed, in attending her, and in suppljring 
her place to her children, that less of it call 
be devoted to labour for their support : in <^ 
either case, with an increase of expence, 
the means of defraying it are diminished^ 
aad aome article from their already small 



XiV 



stock of clothes or furniiure^ is every daf 
disposed o(j to enable them to. meet. the e^ 
igency of the moment. They are frequent* 
ly obliged to beg, borrow, or.pawn one ar- 
ticle to enable Ihem to buy another. 

Of those who can commiserate and re^ 
Keve the sufferings of their fellow^ creatures, 
it will only be necessary to call the attention 
.to the additional horrors concentrated in the 
-wretched dwellings of the poor, where con- 
vtagious fever rages. Such iscenes at aH 
times arrest the feelings, even of the most 
careless observer ; and it is cabulated, thaf^ 
in this case, (which, if possible, increases the 
evil), the proportion of adults infected and 
destroyed, considerably exceeds that of chiU 
dren ; that the numbier of men who perish 
is much greater than that of women, and that 
of a family exposed to contagion, the father 
generally suffers first. 

Scantily subsisted :by his daily, labour^ 
what must the distress of the poor man be^ 
,when unnerved by disease, prostrate on a 
«ick bed, and wanting aid from a starving 
family, whose support has, till that moment^ 
entirely depended on his unremitting toils^ 
and who even yet look only to him ? 

The ghastly countenance, the squalid 
akin, the convulsed or wasted muscles, the 
putrid fsetor^ give dreadful proofs of the Auh 



lignity of that disease whibh^ in ^ few daySj 
sometimes eveii in a few hours^ extinguishes 
life, and converts the frame^ almost before 
death, iilto t tnasd of putrescence. 

Though this most awful extreme of con^- 
tagious fever is not very prevalent in this 
trountry, it is ^till fatal to thousands in th6 
obscure and loathsome retreats of poverty. 
There, every circumstance refines the poison^ 
prepares the victim, and hurls him to rapid 
dissolution ; unheeded by the affluent, the 
gay, and even the humane ; and too often 
avoided by the timid and the ignorant. 
' He lies, then, in a bed which would pro- 
duce disease even to the healthy, absorbed 
in his own foetid and contagious perspira- 
tion^ till he either dies or accidentally reco- 
vers^ His few attendants^ or his helpless 
family, though unaffected by such diseases^ 
are, from other causes, perhaps equally mi- 
serable. And what must be their danger, 
as well as misery, who consume the day 
in the same cell, almost in contact with 
the sick, and waste the night on the same 
pallet of disease and wretchedness ? 

Let even the hardened and unfeeling, or 
the thoughtless and voluptuous, enter for a 
moment these receptacles of pestilence and 
death 1 Let them breathe the noisome va- 
pours \ Iret them hear the cry at once oi 



want ana pain, the incoherent mutterings of 
wild deUrium, the groans of the expiring, 
and the wailings of the miserable survivors ! 
Let them behold the sick, the dying and 
the dead ! 

One would at least expect the infant to 
be exempt from this accumulation of wretch- 
edness, and would hope that the bosom of 
its mother might remain to soothe it; but.-.. 
the tears of the mother drop upon her in- 
fant ; — her bosom is collapsed ; — its vessels 
are exhausted ; — the fountain of life is dried 
up. What can the wish of the mother, — 
what can her filial love, — what can the hoarse 
scream of her thirsty infant, — what can its 
vain suction, effect ? 

On the same bed. perhaps^ are children 
shivering in the cold, and burning in the 
hot stage of fever ; one raving in deli- 
rium, frantic or stupified with despair ; ano- 
ther breathing his last, or extended a disfi- 
gured and loathsome corpse. Probabljf 
some squalid daughter of poverty, careless 
of life, may adminis-ier die produce of rags 
in pawn ; — possillyjome friend of humanity, 
absorbed in pity, and defying danger, may 
pour out the antidote, whilst he inhales the 
poison. 

Let even the unfeeling contemplate this 
scene of consummate wretchedness, and 



ixVU 

withhold^ if he can^ the tribute of hilma4^ 
nity 1 

If td the feeling, the inspection be tob . 
ditiddful, or ihey doubt the reality of such 
scenes, let them enquire of those physicians 
whd have the humanity and the courage to 
extend their aid to the infected poor* Let 
them listen to the reports of tho^ who ex- 
pose their lives in those magazines of pesti^ 
lence^ and have their feelings harrowed oy 
the complication and the intensity of misery* 

The insidious and unrelenting enemy saps; 
by degrees^ the constitution of the infected^ 
li^ho becomes weak and dejected ; hid coun« 
tenaiice is pale and sunk, his skih sallow; 
and his whole frame diminished. The headl 
feels heavy add painful ; the mind inert and 
tonfused, yet ahxious. The heaft is lan- 
guid and oppressed ; the*cif culation feeble; 
hurried; irregiilah The lungs perform theiif 
function with painful effort; breathing is 
frequent;^ audible and interrupted by groana 
and sighs. The blood is irregularly pnv

and alternate chilld and flushes creep along 
the skid. The nttiScles feel wekry, tender^ 
tremijflous } the joints burdened ^nd aching^ 
The saliva becomes tiscid^ the mouth clam* 
itiy, the tongde white, and covered with 
tndcusi the taste indistinct; maukish and

disagreeable. Appetite fails; distaste and 
loathing of food soon follow. The bowels 
participate in the weakened and disturbed 
action of the stomach, and are either torpid 
or irregular. Almost all the secretions are 
disordered or vitiated. The bile is increas- 
ed, attenuated, acrimonious. Sometimes it 
is accumulated, and then absorbed ; at others^ 
it regurgitates into the stomach, or inun- 
dates the intestines. An indiscribably pain- 
ful sense of weight and weakness oppresses 
the loins and the kidneys. The urine, at 
first pale, limpid and copious, is now high 
coloured, turbid and scanty. The sick^ 
though often oppressed and drowsy, is inca- 
pable of rest ; or, if he sleep, is disturbed^ 
agitated, and wakes unrefireshed. 
- These symptoms fluctuate for a short 
time, but are gradually ' aggravated ; the 
pain in the head increases, delirium and stu- 
por ensue. The motion of the heart is ac- 
celerated, and its powers are exhausted. 
The oppressed lungs rapidly convert the air 
they inspire into a hot, offensive and nox- 
ious vapour ; the parched skin burns with 
an arid and consuming heat, or effuses par- 
tial, clammy, foetid sweats. Voluntary ac« 
tion is gradually abolished ; involuntary con- 
vulsive motions succeed. The solids are 
relaxed^ the fluids effused^ the tongue and 



mouth are parched, and encrused with black; 
and sordid mucus. The stomach nauseates 
or rejects whatever is forced into it ; the 
bowels accumulate, with oppressive tension^ 
indigested, fcstid, putrid, contents, or pour 
them out profusely and involuntarily. The 
urine is cloudy, dark, thick, offensive. The 
wan and sallow countenance becomes flush- 
ed, bloated, and by degrees muddy, lurid 
and cadaverous. At length the blood re- 
tires, from the extremities to the faint and 
palpitating heart. The chill of extinction' 
follows its retreat. The breath struggles in 
its passage through the collapsed and ob- 
structed lungs. The frame harrassed, op- 
pressed, exhausted, sinks into dissolution. 

Language cannot represent the extreme 
and complicated wretchedness of a family in 
this situation. 

The physician and surgeon who attend 
often witness misery, which they cannot 
alleviate, and which, lest it might seem ex- 
aggerated, they decline attempting to de- 
scribe. 

Th^ father, then, not unfrequently dies, 
and his orphans become a burden upon tlje . 
public. 

The children are infected from the new 
source of contagion ; and the mother, after 
closing the eyes of her husband, and per*

Let it be recollected, that a depressed si- 
tuation in life does not imply a mean or 
sordid spirit ; neither does an opulent and 
elevated station confer a generous one ; of 
which last, indeed, the necessity of the pre- 
sent attempt to induce the rich to commi- 
serate the neglected sufferings of the poor, 
affords the strongest proof. A noble mind 
with a small fortune, generally has, and 
ought to have^ a share of pride and sensibi-

sensibility is thus, which is not unfrequent^ 
added to poverty and disease, the picture of 
human misery is complete. 

Sometimes, however, the prosperous turn 
away their eyes from the miserable, not 
through insensibility, but because the sight 
interrupts their gaiety. 

Let them be aware, however, that from 
whatever motive it may proceed, even such 
conduct does not exclude them from the 
many chances of being infected by contagi- 
ous diseases ; for, by the dispersion of the 
property of the infected through the me- 
dium of pawn-brokers, rag- shops, and by 
contact in innumerable ways, the poison is 
communicated where least suspected. Who^ 
mdeed, is secure when we consider how so- 
ciety are linked together ? Hackney coaches 
and other public vehicles imbued with it, 
rapidly extend its progress. Religious 
functions, even charitable offices, official 
duties, public spectacles and amusements, 
fnultiply its sources, and may doubtless car- 
ry the contagion through every interme- 
diate rank from the cottage to the palace. 

It is obvious to every one, that the latent 
poison may be imbibed from the very ne- 
cessaries of life, and the means of comfort.

gour of health, and the elevaiion of gaiety. 
He is still oftener fatally as^ed when de- 
bilitated or depressed. 

It were well that the affluent would re- 
lieve such wants when they are pointed out 
to them by those who, from the nature of 
their profession, are every day in the habit 
of witnessing such scenes. The physician, 
as the late Dr Gregory justly observes, has 
many opportunities of seeing people, once 
the gay and the happy, sunk in deep retired 
distress; sometimes devoted to a certain^ 
but a painful and a lingering death.

Diseases absolutely of the most malignant 
l^ind have raged even in our island, sparing 
pieither sex^ a^ or condition ; and^ were 



^e same causes which once produced them 
suffered to exkt, or rather to accumulate, 
there is no qiiestion that, in every part of 
it, they wouW again become equally malig- 
nant. The following picture, during one 
of those epidetnic diseases called pTagues, in 
Jxmdon, is, as drawn by the poet, perfectly 
correct. 



thick and pantingly 



The breath was fetch'd, and with huge lab'ringf 

heav'd. 
At last a heavy pain oppressed the head ; 
A wild deFirium came ; their weeping friends 
Were strangers now,, and this no home of theirs. 
HarrassM with toil on toil, the sinking powers 
Lay prostrate and overthrown ; a ponderous sleep 
Wrapt all the senses ap; thty slept and died. 
In heaps they fell : and oft one bed 
The sick'ning, dying, and the dead contain'd. 

But that drawn by the hbtorian even 
chills us with horror : '^ In the month of 
July, the bill encreasing to two thousand 
and ten, all the bouses v^re shut up,, the 
streets deserted, and scarce any thing to 
be seen therein ; but grass growing, ihnume* 
rable fires for purifying the infected air, cof- 
fins, pest-carts, red crosses upon the doors 
with the inscription of Lord have mercy an 
MS I and poor women in tears with dismal

aspects^ and woeful lamentations^ carrying 
their infants to the grave ; and scarce any 
other sound to be heard than those inces- 
santly emitting from the windows, of Fray: 
for its ! and the dreadful call of Bring out 
your dead ! with the piteous groans of de-. 
parting souls, and melancholy knells of bo-, 
dies ready for the grave/' 

Thus I have described these miseries, let 
us now generally view the manner in which 
they ought to obviated. 
Mode of \ye naturally question every new fact, or

them. hypothesis, and the more so m proportion 
to its novelty and its importance. This 
however, is not the way by which the sphere 
of our knowledge is to be enlarged. ^^ It is 
not,*' says Gregory, " philosophical scepti- 
cism, nor a humble opinion of our present 
knowledge that ought entirely to sway us ; for 
these check the spirit of enquiry. A mean 
opinion of the human powers effectually 
chills the ardour of genius, and bksts all 
grand and extensive views of improvement. • 
Such contracted notions ought never to be 
countenanced ; for the physician, even while 
he deems it impossible to afford relief, ought, 
to attribute that difficulty to the narrow li- ^ 
mits of his knowledge, not to the impossi-%. 
bility of improvement/* 



xxxvu 

' In such situations^ he ought not, however^ 
to omit the administration of consiolation 
and comfort* He has numberless oppor- 
tunities of giving that relief to distress which 
the wealth of India cannot purchase ; and 
this to a benevolent mind must be one <^ 
the greatest of the pleasures it can ever 
hope to enjoy. Were the physician to em- 
ploy himself in such offices at times when 
the very imperfect state of his profession 
will not admit of his exercising duties of a 
more important nature, he would fulfil even 
what the most rigid could expect of him. 
But different, indeed, is often his task. 
' When a physician sets out in life, he 
quickly perceives, that the knowledge most 
necessary to procure him a subsistence, is 
not the mere knowledge of his profession. 
What he finds more ^.essential to that pur- 
pose, are the various arts of flattery and in- 
sinuation, and that of deceiving mankind 
into a high opinion of his understanding, by 
an appearance of solemnity and importance 
in his manner ; views very different from 
those of genius and science. He can, with 
difficulty, find a patron to his real merit, 
because none are judges of it but a few of 
his own profession, whose interest it is that 
it should be concealed. If he attempt to 
shew the weakness of the fashionable sys- 



zzzviU 

tern, or to introdaoe any alteratioii in fhe 
practice, the whole faculty are alarmed ; their 
Tanity is piqued, in having opinions, which 
they thought perfectly established, brought 
into question, and exposed by a young man ; 
and their interest is evidently concerned 
to crush him as soon as possible. In the 
meantime, the effect of every deviation^ 
which he makes firom the common jH^acticej 
is anxiously watched, all his prescriptions 
must remain upon the apothecary*8 file, to 
rise in judgment against him ; and, upon 
any miscarriage, the outcry is raised and 
propagated with die utmost malignity. 

This diabolical plan of persecuting the 
proposers of improvements, must, by repeti* 
tion, change the conduct of the most firm. 
Yet the discerning, who by the hje, are aU 
ways the minority of society, will make the 
just distinction. They will, on comparison^ 
know to whom the merit is due. 

If a physician visit his patients at stated 
periods,, and prescribe for them according 
to rule, without giving himself further trou* 
ble, he ought to be considered as a mere 
artist, and one too of a very dangerous kind 
to society ; but if, on the contrary, he take 
a judicious view of his subject, cautiously 
endeavour to scrutinize each disease, com<> 
pare these with the state of his patient^ and 



deduce his plan idT treatment from all these 
circumstances combined, he is then justly 
entitled to the name of a philosopher in a 
science of the utmost importance, and of 
the greatest utility to the human race. 

I must, with Gregory, observe, that by 
what I have said, I have no intention to lesi- 
€en the dignity of a profjpssion, which has 
ever justly been considered as most imports* 
imt and honourable. For this dignity is by 
no means to be supported by a narrow, self- 
ish corporation spirit, by a peculiar formality 
in dress and manners, or by a&cted airs of 
mystery and self-importance. The true 
dignity of that profession may be best miEtin- 
tained by the superior learning and abilities 
of those who profess it, by the liberal man- 
ners of gentlemen, and by that openness 
and candour, which disdain all artifice, which 
invite a free enquiry, and which, by that 
means, boldly bid defiance to all the ridicule 
and satire which physicians have, by their 
own conduct, so justly deserved. 

If ingenious men, (for the profession does 
involve many of them), would devote half 
the time to the study of nature, which they 
waste upon the study of opinions, their 
science would make much more rapid pro^ 
gress. 



Often, however, for many years after the 
commencement of the practical part of a 
medical man's career, he has to strive with 
many difficulties, part of which are cora- 
inon to all professions j but the most im- 
portant of which are peculiar to the medical 
profession alone. He has to establish his 
professional reputation against the malevo- 
lent and the secret illiberality of those 
whose interests interfere with his, and who, 
from selfish motives, have been anxiously 
watching for his fall. Certainly, in the midst 
of all this, to advance in knowledge by the 
slow, painful, and laborious task of watching 
the sick, and carefully attending to the rise 
and progress of disease, requires a degree of 
patience and self-denial, as difficult of at- 
tainment perhaps as more splendid qualities. 

The physician ought first to make himself 
acquaintt;d with all the causes of epidemic 
disease, carefully to note the influence of 
temperature in each ; its effect also combin- 
ed with a dry or a humid atmosphere, as in* 
fluencing persons of the same and of differ- 
ent temperaments and habits; he ought to 
calculate the effect of each of these causes 
of epidemic disease, under all this variety of 
circumstance, upon persons of each different 
constitution ; for the same combination c»f 
circumstances which in one person may 



sli 



jpfodace a p1«urii^, will only tnmntain iii 
mother the excitement necessary to health* 
He ought also to calculate the influence of 
the pitient's local situation and manner of 
living ; the indispositions to which his fami^ 
ly, profession, or country, are most subject 
and the efiects which the changes of the 
seasons usually produce upon him. 

By observing these niles^ a man of patient 
industry and careful attention^ even with pre- 
tentions to nothing more than plain good 
sense, will be able to distinguish firom eack 
JDther the miocessive epidemics of the year, 
and will discover whether they are simple 
or Mended with each other, or with difier^

vantages over those persons of our profes- 
sion, who have no other data for their rea- 
sonings than the mere symptoms of the mo«- 
inent, the imperfect accounts of a disorder- 
ini patient, or the impertinent ones of a silly 
imrse, by which even they, if their practice 
-be extensive, must too well know they majjr 
be moit fatally misled.

iMMinderi duty, and claim no merit, for hav*

human nature is capable of supporting* 
Some of my fellow creatures I have seen 
sensible of their wretchedness, and heard 
express the deepest, and alas ! the most in- 
dSectual regret, that their want of friends* 
and of money had placed them in situations 
where they were so liable to disease. Others 
I have seen sunk in the completest apathy, 
exhibit'mg a picture of moral, as well as phy* 
sical, depravity, the remembrance of which 
no future circumstance ever can efface from 
my mind. 

It ought to be recollected, that it is not 
the object either of the mere philanthropist, 
or of the magistrate, to suggest plans for the 
removal of disease. The former ought pa- 
thetically to paint the sufferings of his fel- 
low creatures ; the latter ought to execute 
schemes for their relief; but the task itself be- 
longs to the physician. The commoti object 
of all, however, ought to he the removal 
of those well known sources of disease, whose 
•influence every hour robs families of their 
parents, and countries of ttieir patriots ; and 
while we mourn over the wreck of humanity, 
while we deplore the premature loss of those 
whose virtues have commanded our admira- 
tion or our respect, lei it ni)t be forgotten, 
that the causes oi such caiauuties at this mo* 
flient surround us.

Upon this subject, Mr Howard not only 
actually did much, but suggested several 
useful plans, and furnished it)any valuable 
hints which never have been sufficiently at- 
tended to. It is to be regretted, however, tliat 
he confined his observations almost entirely 
to the description of the jails he visited. The 
causes of disease, however, which he there 
detected, and the able manner in whieh he 
has described them, give lis reason to believe, 
that had \it favoured us with a brief descrip- 
tion of the country in the immediate neigh- 
bourhood of these jails, and the relation in 
which they stood to external causes, he 
wduld have rendered his work complete; 
Xioir^would there have been so much necessity 
for presenting the present one to the public* 

N^ver had poetry a worthier subject than 
the exertions of Mr Howard.

ciple, may at length bring my plan to a state 
of greater perfection. 

Many of my opinions on this subject must 
long have been familiar to every one ; as se- 
veral of those causes which first induced 
me to think seriously about i^ have been 
acknowledged sources of disease from the 
earliest periods of history ; but, so far as I 
am acquainted with the writings of former 
times, no author has been fortunate enough, 
either from incorrect statements of fects, or 
from deficient modes of reasoning, to induce 
the Legislative body of this country to adopt 
a general systematic plan for their preven- 
t;ion. 

The principal general sources of disease 
in this, and perhaps in every other country, 
I believe, with very few exceptions, to exist 
}n external, and for the n^ost part, remov- 
able causes ; but, from our faniiliarity with 
numberless circumstances which are unquesi- 
tionably injurious to our comforts, and even 
destructive to our constitutions, we, in the 
common bustle of life, insensibly so over- 
look them, as scarcely ever to regard them 
in a just point of view. Many are willing 
to allow, that these sources are injurious to 
their comforts ; but few believe them capa- 
ble of ruining their constitutions. 



xlvii 

The fenny bounties of England, and other 
swampy grounds, most of which, though 
drainable, are still suffered to exist, form 
well known sources of disease ; and that un- 
cleanness and filth which, in every part of 
our island, obtrudes itself upon our notice^ 
contributes no small share to the propaga- 
tion of them. 

The local situation, and internal structure 
of dwelling-houses, also constitute another 
great source of them. 

In earlier times, both these causes must 
have greatly contributed to their propaga- 
tion and frequency ; and although history 
informs us of uncommon feats of strength 
performed by individuals in former times, 
yet from this we can draw no conclusion 
respecting the health of ancient nations in 
general ; for, I believe, that in every part of 
the world, the greatest proportion of its in- 
habitants have passed their lives in obscuri- 
ty ; and although employed in the most use- 
ful pursuits, their names and their diseases 
are eqimlly unkno>yn to us : they are only 
rare occurrences^ magnified by tradition, that 
have been transmitted to us. 

But whatever diseases are found to arise 
from these, or indeed from any general 
cause— any derangement of natural objects, 
I am convinced they may, even in the pre- 

c4 



xlviii 

fent imperfect state of physical thoi^ 
with difficulty, be wholly, or for the mofil 
part, removed. 

That the removal of many such noisao-* 
ces, the causes of all these calamitief, shoul4 
never have been thought of, particularly m 
Great Britain, where scientific research co|^ 
stitutes so prominent a feature of the oa* 
tional character, has to me often been m, 
matter of surprise and wondar, Tb^ adop^- 
tion of such a plan would not mily contr^ 
bute to the hapfnness of individuals^ but to 
the increase ^of the public revenue ; as the 
healthy state of a country is one of the great- 
est, is indeed the first, cause of its pro^ieri- 
ty and affluence. 

Tlie wealth of all nations arises fixHn their 
quantity of productive labour; and there- 
fore whatever proportion of unproductive 
individuals exist in any country, not only is 
a similar proportion of ifrealth lost to it^ but 
an additional proportion a£ its wealth is de- 
^royed. Mr Malthus has proven, that ap 
increase even of active population wpuld, #t 
the present moment, be pr^udicial to Great 
Britain. How infinitely more so must aa 
increase of inactive pc^ulatioQ be» not pnl j

OF THE GENERAL CAUSES OF DISEASE* 



CHAP. I. 

OP NATURAI. CAUSES. ~ * 



Sfitr. I.— Of Siw7; 



ii •Jttn 



Although the derangements of climate Rcaiowfoif 
have, perhaps^ of all natural causes^ the great- of invcsti^ 
est influence in the production of disease^ Sorted!" 
yet as all the aeriform fluids composing the 
atmosphere^ as well as those which are 
often blended with it, are productions of 
the superficies -of the earth, or of the va- 
rious substances which exist upon it, it is 
soil evidently which demands our first at^ 



tention. Indeed, it is only from such sub- 
stances, that the coinponent parts of the 
atmosphere can be obtained. We have 
proofsj therefore, that the atmosphere is en- 
tirely a production of the soil, and that when 
portions of it are vitiated, or otherwise ren- 
dered unfit to support animal or vegetable 
life, it is from this source alone that the in- 
jury arises, and from this source only that it 
can possibly be repaired. 
Composi- The soil, strictly speaking, consists of mi- 
dics. neral, and of the remains of vegetable and 

animal, bodies. 

With regard to mineral bodies, many of 
those substances which, in former times, we 
were taught to consider as elementary, have 
gradually, as science has advanced, been 
found to be of a compound nature. Mo- 
dern chemists have indeed clearly proved, 
that numerons bodies which, even till very 
lately, were conceived to be of an elementa- 
ry kind, are actually compounds. 

Natural philosophers, nevertheless, enu- 
merate a considerable number of bodies 
which they yet consider as simple ; not that 
they actually btUeve these to be simple bo- 
dies, for every analogy opposes such a sup- 
position, but because they have not been 
able to decompose them by the usual modes 
of Mudysis. 



A brilliant rtepj howeverj hai latdj been 
made, towarda the reduction of these simple 
bodifis^ aod the earths a6d alkalies are now 
shewn to be fnerety metallic oxyds. . But it is 
highly probable that the metals themselves 
9te compound bodies ; and as we erery day find 
a gttateiJt and greater numbef of substances 
rejiuoeabla to the aeriform fluids^ analogy 
entitles us to conclude^ that they alone are 
atmple^ It is even questionable bow many 
of. these are elementary. Indeed, I need 
not merely Dige analogy in favour ^ this 
opinion : ira have the m<Mt decided proofs 
of ita truth ; Ibr^ in the composition of v^^ 
tables^ supported soldy by air and water^ 
Wie find^ by chemic^d analysis, that there is 
bpjtb alkaline and metallic substances. Now 
it }$ extremely evident, that these bodies 
could not exist there unless produced by 
n^w ciNnlnnationsj formed among the con*** 
atituent perta of the air and water absorbed 
by the vegetables. 

The consideration of 4he motion of bo» Motion of 
4iw naturally follows that of their oomposi* Bodies 
.tioo. With regard to it, Mr Boyle ol>- 
aenres, that '^ local motions^ which are wofrt 
foXhep to be past by unobserved, or to be 
tfaoi^ht not worth the observing^ may have 
a notable operation, though not upon the 
generality of bodies^ yet upon such «s are 

A2 



f

peculiarly disposed to admit it^ and so may 
haVe a considerable share in the produc* 
tion of divers difficult phenomena of na- 
ture^ that are wont to be referred to less 
genuine, as well as less intelligible causea.''- 
This philosopher, whose accuracy of in- 
vestigation must always stand high, farther 
asserts, that absolute rest does not exist in 
nature, and, in the following way, illustrates 
the disposition of minute bodies to mo- 
tion. A leaf of paper displayed, will much 
longer hover in the air, than if it were re* 
duced into smaller compass. This minute- 
ness of particles disposes them to be carried 
upwards by the impulse of other bodies, and 
by that of the agitated air ; thus, we see, that 
horses in the high-way, though they do not, 
with the strokes of their feet, make stones 
or gravel fly up, yet easily raise clouds of 
dust, often mingled with the smaller grains 
of sand. And where timber is sawin^^ the 
same wind that does not in the least fiioye 
the beams, and scarce at all the chips, easily 
carries up the saw-dust into the air. And 
we see, that while smoke readily ascends, 
even small clods of soot, which are aggre. 
gates of the particles of smoke, fall to the 
earth. Again, when water and several other 
liquors seem to be continued masses of mat* 
ter, and as much at rest as the very glasses 



tibat joontam ihem^ their constituent parti<- 
des ate in an actual and ^ari^^ though Aow 
and unperceiyed^ motion. 

It may be proved^ t^^t sim^ar piotiona 
take place among the particles of the very 
hardest bodies. If a springs though naade 
of so hsurd a body as st^l^ \k forcibly bept;^, 
BBd hfpk bpt a short while in that position^ 
aa^soon as the fprce th^tkept it bent is rer 
i^aoved, it will again return to its former fi* 
gum.; but if it b^ kept too long in that for- 
oed-ppaitioti^ it will by de^ees lose its ela^i-r 
^tyy and' retain a curved form, though the 
£9fM that bent it be removed. This shewa^ 
tbattb^reis a continued endeavour pf the 
fV^ of bodies to asasume n^ statest^.: 

Although, therefore, distinct masses of 
Qiilter may appear at perfeqt rest, the pafti- 
^)ea composing them may thus b? in continuf- 
alimotion.: 

. It >s not perhaps* easy for us to imagine 
81^ slowness as it is very possible for na- 
ture^tp make use of in her operations, though 
Qfur npt being able to discern the motion of 
aTsbadow; on 4 dial-rplat^, or that of anindeac 
upon a do^ or watch; ought to make ua' 
fl^iiaible of the incompefa^nce of our eyes to 
dkK^em many motions of natural bodieSx 
which reason assures us miist be jncomph 
rably slower than these. 

A3 



This is the general tendency of M. Boyle's 
arguments, and we cannot deny them the 
praise of great ingenuity. 
Effluvia of The consideration of the effluvia of bodies 
^*' properly follows that of their motions, and 
leads to the investigation of the influence 
of these effluvia in the production of disease. 
The complete dissolution of matter hap- 
pens in no one instance with which we are 
an]Ofiinted. Alterations in its appearance 
and sensible prc^erties, however, take place 
every moment j we witness this in the per- 
petual changes going on in the world around 
ws — in the production of new animated be- 
ings (HI the one hand, and, on the other, in 
the death of those whom we may have 
loved or admired. 

Now, that fluid bodies, such as liquors, and 
those which are manifestly moist or soft, 
■ should easily send forth emanations, will with- 
■^wit difficulty be granted ; especially consi- 
pdering the sensible evaporation that is ob- 
['yiDusin water, wine. See, and, approaching 
Fte this, that loose oontestpre of parts which 
poonstitutes all soft bodies. But that even 
phard and ponderous bodies, notwithstanding 
(fee solidity and strict cohesion of their com- 
ponent parts, should likewise emit effluvia, 
will to many appear improbable.

,,A very great xmmber^ if jiot the

fffm tbM0 that are solid may^ at kast some* 
timeSj, have their litt^ atmospheres^ though 
the neighbouring hodtea must often prevent 
^ evaporation from extendisg equally hi 
«¥eiy direoticHi around them. 

Now» when we , ctmsider that those sub* 
stances are the most unlikely to afford such 

A4 



effluvia^ which are either very cold, or i^ry 
solid^ hard and ponderous, if it can 'be 
ahewn that none of these qoaliiicatiotM 
can prevent a body from ediittitig effluvia^ it 
must appear highly probable, that them is im 
aort of bodies incapable of affi>rding iiiiem 
emanations. ■ 

. Ice, then, is one of the coldest bodies w* 
know,: yet it loses by evaporation. Mr 
Boyle ptx>ved'tbis by experiment; for,sayi 
he, ^^ having counterpoised a . convenknt 
quantity of • ice ; in a good balailce, foith^ 
with exposed it therein to a cold lurofti* 
frosty night, that the evaporation ' shotdd 
be fh>m ice, not from water, I found the 
next morning, that though the scale vdiereJ^ 
in the ice was pot was dry, which ai^^ued^ 
as well as the coldness of the weather, that 
the exposed concret;i6n had not thawed, yet 
I found its weight to be ; considerably di» 
minisbed, and this experiment I Quccess-r 
fully made in more than one winter.'' 

Mr Boyle further ingeniously remarks, 
that, ^^ for aught we know, the decrement 
of bodies in statical experiments long, con^ 
tinned, may be somewhat greater than 
even nice scales discover to us ; for- wo 
are not sure that the weights themselves 
may not in time suffer a little diminutioi[^

embowdled fires, such as Hungary and 
Italy. 

With respect to v^etables, I may re- EffluTii of 
mark, that while living they alter their ^^ 
temperature very slowly and difficultly ; but 
the evaporation from their numerous surfa- 
ces is much greater than from the same 
space of land uncovered by vegetables. Dr 
lUes observes, that tracts of land covered 
with trees or vegetables, emit more vapour 
than the same space covered with water; 
and Mr Williams found the surplus to 
amount to f • 

Dead vegetable matter, such as the wood 
of musical instruments of different kinds, 
fequires, after it has been cut, twenty, forty, 
and in some instances fourscore years, before 
it acquires its full seasoning. 

With respect to animal ef&uvia, I may Efflnvii of 
mention, that in every instance, even where 
the' more exhalable parts, as in eggs, 
shell-fish, &c. are closely covered, they grow 
lighter. 

When a partridge, hunted deer, &c. have 
casually set a foot uplbn the ground, that 
part where the foot-step has been (though 
invisibly) impressed, continues for many 
hours a source of emanations.

When watery, particles soak into and dif*

parts is thoroughly dissolved. 

Mr Cruickshanks collected a quantity of 
that gas which is propagated during the 
summer months in marshy places^ and whioh 
may be readily separated by agitating the 
putrefying vegetables. On examination^ b^ 
found it to be oxycarbonated hydrogene gaf^ 
formerly known by the name of heavy in* 
flammable air. This air is more destructive 
to animal life than any of the other gasea i 
for when mixed with twenty times its voluma 
of atmospheric air, and inhaled into the 
lungs^ it produces sickness^ vertigo and faint- 
ing. Any other of the gases may be breath^ 
ed with impunity^ upon being mixed with 
four or five times their volume of atmosph^ 
ric air. This gas being very little lighter 
than common air^ nearly in the proportion c^ 
2 to 3, is also more likely to be preserved in

which is about 13 times lighter than it.

The odmisrion of air and moisture to these 
wAMncM causes tli^m on the contrary to 
futrify $ a heat from 60 to 80 of Fahrenheit 
if that which most promotes it, and by in* 
tenie cold it is entirely checked. 

It is observed, that in countries where 
tfcisre is great heat and little moisture, such 
m. Bsru, Egypt, &c. dead animd substaii- 
dsk may be kept a long time without putre- 
fying. 

Various highly rei^ctable authorities may 
lie adduced in favour of animalcula produ<« 
eiag pvArefection ; while others with more 
pralMbility assert, that it is, on the contrary, 
Aom putrefaction that the animalcula arise. 

Dr Macbride endeavours from experiment 
te prove, that fixed air is the cementing 
foindple or bond of union which connects 
€bsB ultimate particles of bodies to each other, 
and prevents them from running into a state 
0f putrefaction, to which all animal and ve* 
getable 8iU>stances have a natural tendency.

and at which^ according to htm^ thejr arrive 
with more ease when divested of this prind- 
ple* 

Alexander admits^ that at such a tune a 
change in the substance takes place ; but he 
does not think that change to be putrefac- 
tion ; and^ in order to prove this^ he shows 
by experiment that fixed air may be separated 
from bodies without their becoming putrid ; 
and that fixed air^ added to putrid substances, 
has no effect in rendering them sweet ; and 
further, that substances do putrefy without 
their fixed air being allowed to escape from 
them. 

The evident conclusion from this is, that 

the loss of fixed air is only a circumstance 

attending the putrefaction of bodies, and by 

no means the cause of putrefaction.

these £f- air quitc mdependently of heat, or at least 

S^thcair!^ of greater heat than the common tempera* 

tureofour atmosphere; and it cannot be 

doubted, that even at that very moderate 

temperature, certain changes in the texture 

of the hardest bodies takes place, rendering 

them sufficiently volatile to float in invisv* 

. ble particles in the common atmospheric 

air. . 

These substances remain in the air in the 

same way that different salts remain in soh 



17 



Itttbh ill water. Now, as the suspension of 
tfie particles of water in air, of salt in the 
wlitt^r? of the ocean, and of other heaty bo- 
diesr' in fluids that dissolve them, seem t6 be 
{^henonienia of the same kind, we may rea^ 
(sonably siippose that they arise from th6 

same cause, and that what we call evapora^ 

* « 

tioh is fiothing more than a gradu^ ^lutioit' 
rf water iti air. 

' Dr Halley observes, that evaporation is 
▼aitly protabted by agitation, which conti- 
BiuaHy brings fresh particles of the aerial 
fiHid into contact with the body it dissdves, 
in the place of those that have beenalr^dy 
saturated. In cold weather^ it is observed^ 
til^e is not so copious andcontinual:aneva^ 
^ration of water in particular, and therefore 
the air is then generally clearer than in 
hot weather. Still, however, there ai' at- all 
titties dome degree of evaporation ; -and the 
H^er part of the air being pressed; by the 
weight of the atmosphere, against the surface 
of 'the watier, is thereby enabled to attract 
and dissolve the particles with which it is in 
contact, and to separate them from the rest 
of the mass. Since, therefor^ the cause of 
fiolutibn is in this case the stronger attrac* 
tion' of the particles of water to air than 
to each other, those that are already dissolv-^ 
fd aiid taken up will be still further raised 



%9 



by the attraction of the superincumbent diy 
9ir, and will thus diffuse themselves^ stiik 
graduaUy rising higher and higher^ and rent-* 
dering t^e lowest air less saturated^ so th^ 
it will still be able to dissolve and take up 
&eah particles of water. Thus ice or snow 
vnW evaporate as well as water, its particlea 
b^ii% attrapted and dissolved by the air^ 
which is strongly pressed against its surfiicf. 

* Nqw^ thoi^gh vapours are first raisedji i^ 
abound mofst in the lower parts pf the aU 
mosphefe, yet they cannot there form cloudsy 
because the heat that aided their solutioiu 
GcHilributes to ke^p them in the same atat^* 
But when they are carried by winds into the 
higher ^arts of the atmosphere, where the 
aaioe. heiat is wanting, the cold air is nofr 
able to hdd in solution the whole of what is . 
carried up» but suffers some of it to coaJlesOT 
into particles, which slightly attracting each 
etber^ !a;id beiji^ intermixed with air, foim 
clouds^ having the very same appearance 
with steam, which consists of small partiolea 
of water> mixed with air, and not dissolved 
in it. 

In illustration of this, we must all have 
observed, that in a hot summer's day, the air 
over wet marshy ground is copiously filled 
by aqueous vapours, but growing cooler 
ifier iUQ^aet^ it is not able to hold all theas

separates them from the surface, and frcun

that elasticity by which they were at first li«>

without elasticity in common evaporation. 
' In illustration of the effects of ef&uvia, I Effects of 
may observe, that not only less land floods, 
tjtmt overflow contiguous fields, but even 
those terrible inundations which sometimes 
ixnrer whole countries, are composed of par« 
^les singly so inconsiderable as drops of 
rain when they continue to fall in those 
multitudes we call showers.

Thus, also^ accumulated masses of sach 
minute bodies as grains of sand^ being heap- 
ed together in sufficient: numbers^ , make 
haDks5 by which the largest-ships lare^scnne-* 
times split ; nay, it is justly observed, that k 
is. these banks which in most places serve 
as boundaries for the sea itself.. / 

Thus, also, though a single grain of gun- 
powder, or even two or three together, have 
not force enough to do much mischief, yet 
two or three barrels of these grains explode 
ing tc^ether^ are capaMe of blowing up' 
ships or Jiouses, and of performing prodigi^ 
ous operations. '^^ 

Effluvia being of different kinds, and comi' 
sequently capable of producing different e& 
fects, we shall commence by making a £em 
observations on the simple evaporation of 
water, and its efiects on different substan- 
ces, and then proceed to those of more nox^ 
ious qualities. . / 

Watery effluvia^ simply considered, have 
little, if any, bad effects on the health of iq^ 
dividuals ; but it is pretty well ascertained^ 
that its general effects on the climate are 
often remarkable. In woody countriea, 
where a great evaporating surface is present- 
ed to the air, the climate is colder than in 
those that are open and cultivated ; and m 
change of this kind bang made in the sur- 



fll 



hce of countries^ the climate is altered con- 
siderably in its nature. In Guiana this cir- 
comstance is strongly marked ; for part of 
that country has been cleared from wood 
only iribout a century, and the heat in that 
part is already excessive ; whereas, in the 
woody parts of the same country, the inha- 
bitants are obliged to make fires every 
night* 

• Draining of land, fallowing the ground, 
til6 fbrni^tion of wide turnpike roads, and 
similar improvements on the soil, tend 
to ameliorate the climate ; but artificial ir- 
ligation, artificial rivers, ornamental lakes, 
itoating docks, 8cc. by increasing aqueous 
imr&ce, increase the disposition to cloudi* 
ness, and consequently to coldness and hu- 
midiiy, 

« A thermometer hung over a damp piece 
iSff ground, during fogs or exhalations arising 
from it, will often indicate a degree of cold' 
below the freezing point, which can only be 
produced by watery evaporation. 

The chillness of the body, so sensibly 
perceived when in this situation, seems to 
proceed from the same cause, and to pro-^ 
thice nearly the same sensations which the 
damp floor of a chamber communicates to 
those who happen to continue in it whilst iq 
that state.

The effect of aqueous vapours on different 
kinds of woodj even of the hardest texture^ 
is remarkable. Even where seemingly little 
exposed to its influence^ as in windowi^ 
doors, &Cm they are often enlarged in size, 
in an extraordinary degree ; and this beings 
continued for a considerable length of tirne^ 
they rot and fall to pieces. 

In consequence of the particular moistufo 
of certain climates^ as that of Ireland, it has 
been observed, that the annual crops arft 
much inferior to ours in every respect, evefk 
in the same season ; the general weight of 
Irish grain being about 4S pounds to thi^ 
Winchester busheli while that of Englaikl 
has weiglied 6% ur 53 pounds in the eaoM 
season. 

To this moisture of the climate has beta 
imputed the absence, in the sfime country,, 
of various reptiles, where it is a traditton^ 
that if poisonous creatures have been care' 
fully brought there from other parts, thejf 
have died almost as soon as they came thi« 
^her. There are some other islands to 
which a like hostility to such animals is 
^scribed. 

The effluvia from mineral bodies is more 
generally destructive than those whio^ "vrv 
t^ftve now considered^

vapours. A lighted torch goes in a moment 
mtirdiy out when immersed in it» and a pis- 
tol cannot be fired hi it. 
' It has been observed^ that pectoral com^ 
plaints in this country have increased in 
luimber since we ceased to use wood fires^ 
and^ on the contrary, adopted more genemU 
iy the ^an of burning mineral coal. 

* The ^ects of effluvia in laboratories have 
trflen been experienced by chemists, l^ose 
tif 6ulphur> antimony, arsenic, and severi^ 
#ther minerals, unless great care be takeft 
in nnluting the vessels in which they had 
4been distilled or sa})limedi make them 
stagger; and have been krSbwn even ta 
Mrifce them down. 

* Sennertus relates, that a painter, on optdn-^ 
tng a box where orpiment, which is used as 
ti pigment, had been long kept, had his facd 
gelled, and was'thrown into fits. 

Mr Boyle also relates the story of a young 
tnan, who having heated himself in a tennis^ 
court, with an amulet containing arsenic up*« 
on his breast, the virulence of its particlea 
fiiade him fall down dead upon the spot. 

The effluvia from burning charcoal also 
produce very prejudicial effects ; for we hav^ 
many instances of persons, who, by lying for 

s 4 



M 



A night exposed to them, have been the 
next mornmg, or sooner^ found d6ad tn their 
beds. . 

That various bodies of a poisonous natnni 
may exercise such operations upon others 
by their effluvia transmitted through the air, 
as they do by their gross substance, is a 
truth of which we have some examples. 8r 
mong medical writers^ 

Even medicines, which are of a milder 
nature and operation, than poisons, are capa* 
ble in some cases of producing by their e& 
fluvia similar, though less powerful, effects 
than they are known to h^ve whep ip sub* 
Stance. Sen.^ertus affirms, that sppie per«- 
sons will be purged by the very odour c^ cor 
locynthis... 

The mortal effects of subterraneous dam{« 
in mines, deep, well^ and ainular close pla« 
ces, as also of . the. fumea of confined burii^ 
ing charcoal, may be accounted for in the 
same way, these being generally deleterious 
exhalations from mineral substances. 

We likewise fipd that vegetable effiuvit 
are possessed, in ^lany insta^nqes^ of very 
noxious effects. 

Nothing, for instance, is sweeter than ^ 
TfiB^, ^d yet its fragrant effluvia are far 
from being favourable to the air in which it 
is confined. Some^ to whom the smell of 



25 



,4^ flower is not unpleasing, are nfiverthe'*' 
leas so much hurt by it, that it mal^ them 
^ick> and would make them even swoon, if 
net seasonably prevented. 
i!. It iS observed, that on breathing for some 
•time; in a conservatory, where the floor is 
J^ept moist, and a number of luxuriant vege- 
tables are. growing, there isfelt a fullness, 
with sometimes a giddiness, in the head, 
aod isome debility ; but if we put our head 
out of the window, or inhale the atmosphe- 
ric, air from without, through a tube, the 
unpleasant sensation subsides, although the 
rest of the body be exposed to the warm and 
llUmid air. 

" The examples i have given of the noxious 
effects of vegetable effluvia on the living bo« 
dy, are, I think, satisfactory. - In addition to 
|hfiim, it is a very remarkable circumstance, 
that there are some even of plants which do 
not cthrive in the neighbourhood of others. 
This is observed of the cabbage and cycla-^ 
meus, of hemlock and rue, of reeds and fern. 
We. have filso many examples of such like 
antipathies among animals. These effects 
jire of course produced by the effluvia which 
^re emitted by all organised bodies. 

It seems pretty well established, that 
fnarshes of a boggy sort, or where the soil 
consists of peat^ are not prejudicial to health -, 



26 



and mcurs of itself is not easily corruptibly 
and has even the power of preserving aiiK 
mal and vegetable substances for ages* What 
therefore we understand by putrid substanccif 
is of a very different nature from this ; and . 
and where exhalations from marshea (nto?^ 
prejudicial to the health, it is probably Ofv^ 
ing to the innumerable vegetables and insects 
that die and putre^ in them. 

After heavy rains, in many countrieay k 
very dangerous moisture of the air ariati^ 
particularly where the water after land floodi 
atiagnates and corrupts in low grounds ]; 
but otherwise, in the flattest grounds, if {m>* 
perly drained, frequent showers have a sallK 
tary effect in tempering the heat, refreshing 
the stagnating water, and precipitating pa* 
trid exhalations. 

On the contrary, stagnant waters^ and 
even large rivers, in dry seasons, produce ve^ 
ry bad effects* When a great part of their 
channel is left uncovered, its moisture is 
totally exhaled, it becomes a hard and solid 
crust, and no sooner do the rains fall^ thati 
gradually the long parched crust of earth 
and clay softens, and the ground, which be* 
fore had not the least smell, begins to emit 
a stench, which, in a short time, becomes 
exceedingly noisome; and then, in evcly 



ar 



Ciwntry where such ocduirenced ar^ cbm^ 
mor^i the seaaon of sickness commences. 
: In the day time^ these swsmpy. shores emit 
Sii smell resembling that of corrupted flesh> 
or putrid carrion ; and a near approach to 
such putrid swamps is then apt to produce 
aa iaunediate sickness, a vomiting, and af- 
terwards a low nervous fever. 

The smell of the swamps, and of the va- 
pour arising from them, at this time, resem« 
Ues the unwholesome scent of a ditch late*- 
ly« deanedi And the effect upon the mort 
hadithy and vigorous constitution is oilen the 
ejbiUtng cold fit of an ague, terminating in a 
fever> with delirium, bilious vomiting, a flux, 
or even death itsdf. 

. 1% has even been observed, that certain 
periods of the year in every country are 
more unhealthy than others, andean expla- 
nation of this has been attempted ill Various 
ways by medical writers. 

It haS| I believe, been pretty generally ao« 
knowledged, that in this country the preva- 
lence of disease is mOst conspicuous in 
spring an,d autumn, but that the diseases of 
spring are milder than those of autumn. 
Among other modes of accounting for this, 
it has been supposed^ that the difference in 
the severity of . the complaints in spring and 
^tflm^ is owing to the different effects pro- 



3S 



daced in the constitution by the season pn^ 
vious to each. Thns, it is said, that the^ 
bracing effects of winter render the diseases 
of spring milder, and the relaxing efiects of 
sommer, on the ccxitrary, make the autom-* 
nal diseases more severe. 

Perhaps it is possible to give a more satis^ 
factory explanation of these occnrrences^ ' 
Is it not more likely, that the remarkably 
sudden changes of the weather in this comK 
try render the spring months unwholescxne ; 
and that, on the other hand, the putrid efflu- 
via arising from decaying vegetables about' 
the harvest time, are the principal causes of * 
those diseases which are so very common^ • 
and so very destructive at that period ? 

It is a well known fact, in those countries 
where lint grows, that if the process of 
steeping be carried on in a running stream^ 
the fish, &C. farther down the river, to a 
very considerable distance, die almost inn- 
mediately on the impregnated water reacH^i 
ingthem. 
inEogiand Many years ago, there broke out, amcMigst 
the scholars at Wadham College, a very 
malignant fever, that swept away great num- ' 
bers, whilst the rest of the colleges remain* - 
ed unvisited. The singularity of the case 
engaged the attention of all the gentlemen 
of the faculty, in a serious inquiry into the 



^ 



causes of 80 fenwkable to effect; and all 
j^eed,;that the con tagtoos infection arose 
from ; tlie putrefaction of a vast quantity of 
c^bjb^ea thrown into a heap out of the se- 
yaral'gar4e9s near Wadham College. The 
npxious effluvia . arising from such putrid 
ferip^^ationv mixing with the air, had con* 
fiejtyuently power to infect tibe adjoining 
bmkUng;^ though not to pass farther* 
; -li^ow^ it iu5 to be observed, that all alkaline 
p)aQ!ts,:SUch as cabbage, turnips, raddishes, 
fil^^rwhen in a putrid, state, come nearest to 
ii)$t of the animal corruption. 
^r:Ia :th0 hundreds, of Essex, where the

of North .Wales, and the northern countries 
^ Europe, pn the contrary, are, in general, 
inflammatory, though cold be still the ex- 
isting cause ; the atmosphere being, there 
aod.dry. 

In shoirt, in all low grounds, such as Hoi- inHoliand. 
]andj &c. &c. where the soil is continually 
moist, equally bad effects result from it. 
, Among those troops which were sent to 
the continent about fifty or sixty years ago, 
that circumstance was particularly remarka* 



30 



ble. Whilst the days were sultiy, and tke 
nights cool and foggy, it was remarked that 
several of the men of those regiments whkh 
lay nearest the inundations were seized wt 
once with a burning heat, and violent head^ 
ache, some previously feeling a short and 
slight chillness, others mentioning no p^ 
ceding disorder. They complmned besidei 
of intense thirst, aching of the bcHiea, a fmn 
of the back, great lassitude and inquietude ; 
frequently of nausea, sickness, or pain aboul 
the pit of the stomach, sometimes attended

Lancisius, too^ at a much later period re*^ 
lafces, that thirty gentlemen and ladies of the

made an excursion, upon a party of pleasuiv,

In Asia, the Arabs, in order to conquer in Bassoca^

I'he Dutch, in endeavouring to make their 
capital in India to resemble their cities in 
Europe, have adorned it with canals or rather. 
ditches, intersecting each other, and running 
through every part of it ; and these, in the 
hot and unwholesome climate of Java, dur- 
ing and , after the rainy season, become .ex- 
tremely noxious, to the inhabitants, but more 
particularly to strangers. The unwhole- 
some air of that place alone has cut ofFmoie: 
Europeans than have fallen by the sword in. 
all the bloody wars carried on by the Datchi 
in that part of the worlds 
In Egypt. Some writers, who have attempted to ac*; 
count for the origin and cause of the tru6c 
plague in Egypt, do not seem to be well: 
acquainted with the nature of its winds and 
seasons. Were it not for the inundation of? 
the Nile, this country, in all probability,: 
would have been rendered uninhabitable, 
during the summer moiiths, nut on account 
of the filth of Grand Cairo, but for another 
reason, viz. the hot winds from the deserts, 
which. often. begin here in the middle of, 
April, and continue to blow for 30 or 40. 
days. The heavy dews which then fall in 
the night serve in sonie measure to refresh 
the air ; but when, by the increasing heat of 



33 



Vm Mtnmer, the samiel winds have acquired 
a pestilential violence, and the most destruc- 
tive quality, then a sheet of water is, by the 
hand of providence, spread over Egypt. 

IVosper Alpinus observes, that the st^* 
nating canals at Grand Cairo breed every 
3fear a malignant kind of small pox. He 
also remarks, that the pestilential fevers are 
botb epidemic and fatal at Alexandria in au- 
tamn, after the recess of the Nile. 

The lower part of this country being ren- 
dered unwholesome by the annual inunda- 
tion of the Nile, and being surrounded on 
three sides by large and extensive deserts of 
aumd, is thereby exposed to the effects of 
the noisome vapour, which, during the 
summer months, arises from hot sultry 
sand. 

Now, there does not seem to be any 
thing peculiar in the air or climate of Egypt 
more favourable to the generation of the 
plague there, than in many other countries 
where it is unknown. There are many parts 
of Africa and America, which, in common 
with Egypt, are subject to inundations ; 
where the climate is extremely hot, and the 
ground marshy and covered with wood ; 
and in those countries^ (natui^ally more un» 
wholeiSome than Egypt,) the plague, so far 
as we can learn^ is not generated without 

c 



34. 



contagion ; on the contrary, in most of those 
countries it is wholly unknown. We must 
conse<juently ascribe it in general to the soil^ 
and to the filth of the inhabitants. 

InEtluopia Jn Ethiopia, those prodigious swarms of 
locusts, which at times cause a families 
by devouring the fruits of the earth, unleem 
they happen to be carried by the winds deal* 
off into the sea, are observed to entail a new 
mischief upon the country, when they die 
and rot, by raising a pestilence. 

In Guinea. The most mortal epidemic in Guinea ift 
that low malignant ffever, of the remitting 
kind, which rages only in the wet season. 
The dry belly-ache is the same disease 
there as in the West Indies ; but the Gui* 
^ nea worm seems ih a manner peculiar to 
Africa. It has also been supposed to proceed 
from a bad quality in the water of the coun* 
try, which is in general owing to the woodj^ 
and marshy soil.

that the English castle at Whydaw is reck<^

always passes over an inconsiderable brook oC 
water, which produces some aquatic plants^ 
always covered with a putrid slime.

Cayenne has proved very sickly to the in the Bas. 
French ; and they prefer the air of Marti- ^he French

A large and commodious hospital was se- in Jamaica* 
Veral years ago built in Jamaica5 which, from 
its grandeur, was called Greenwich Hospi- 
tal ; but, in consecjuence of an adjoining 
marsh, sickness was often protracted;, and 
never cured in it, and it was at last found 
necessary to abandon it, and all the sick soon 
recovered ^hen taken out to sea. 

These instances clearly prove the truth of 
the doctrines which I have advanced^ 

In consequence of its having, been found Particular 
by experiment that animal substances are these Ef- 
preserved for a greater length of time in pu- ^^^^** 
trid vegetable matters, or in infusions of 
these substances, it has been supposed they 
could have no very great share in producing 
disease on the living fibre. It ought to be 
observed by those gentlemen who make 
such experiments, and who draw such con- 
clusions from them, that it is highly proba- 
ble that these substances produce very dif- 

c2 




ferent effects on the living from what they 
may do on the dead animal body ; and like- 
wise, that there is probably a very great dif- 
ference of action produced on living bodies by 
exposing them to the effluvia of putrefying 
subtances, from what is produced by immers- 
ing them into the substance 6f putrid materials. 

It has been asserted, that even were 
the effluvia from marshes, or those which 
are generated in mines, the cause of 
diseases of different kinds, the men em- 
ployed in draining the one, and in digging 
in the other, would suffer more from them 
than they do. If, however, we reflect how 
completely a person may from habit acquire 
the power of resisting the noxious effects 
even ofthe strongest poisons, and of effluvia 
of the most destructive kind, we shall easily 
be able to account for these exceptions. 

That pure water does not injure air, either 
in the form of vapour, or otherwise, is, I 
think, sufficiently evident. For, were mois- 
ture alone capable of producing disease, 
Ireland would be more unhealthy than 
Egypt, the former being a very wet, the 
other a very dry soil ; but this is, by no 
means, the case. 

It now almost amounts to a demonstra- 
tion, from the accurate observation of Dr 
Lind, and others, that the vapour arising , 



^7 



from ^wet, marshy soils, acts on the human 
body as a specific contagion, and not mere- 
ly as producing cold. 

In dry gravelly grounds of large extent, 
the dew is entirely water, and usually invisi- 
ble I while that which arises from standing 
waters, morasses, bituminous earths, or plai- 
ces abounding with the exhalations of putrid 
.bodies, must have various substances in it, 
and must often be pernicious to health. 

The miasma, says Cullen, so universally 
the cause of fever, is that which arises from 
marshes or moist ground, acted upon by 
heat. The similarity of climate, season,.and 
soil, in the different countries in which in- 
termittents arise, and the similarity of the 
diseases, though arising in different regions, 
concur in proving, that there is one common 
cause of these diseases, and that that is this 
marsh miasma. 

What the particular nature of this mias- 
ma is we, know not ; nor do we certainly 
know whether it differs in kind ; but it is 
probable that it does not, and that it varies 
only in the degree of its power, or perhaps 
in its quantity in a given space. We must 
not, however, consider marsh effluvia as the 
universal cause of intermittents, since it is 
found, that persons constantly residing m

the most healthy parts of the metropolis ai^ 
sometimes affected by them. 

That marsh effluvia^ however, in whatever 
particular way they may act, in general pro* 
duce disease, seems very evident. Exhala- 
tions, also, from cavities in the earth being < 
thrown open by earthquakes, which expose 
to the action of the air, minerals, &c. from 
which noxious effluvia proceed, produce sif- 
milar effects. 

In considering the perpetual changea 
ivhich bodies thus undergo, whether they be 
miileral, vegetable, or animal, we cannol 
help admiring the celebrated fable of the 
Greeks, which so beautifully expresses the 
doctrine of these changes from inorganic to 
organic existence, and which has, of late^ 
been so elegantly described by a poet of our 
own : 

^^ Hence when a monarch or a mushroom dies^ 
A while extinct the orecanic matter lies : 
While nature sinks in time's destructive storms. 
The wrecks of death are but the change of forms ^

and TQ of azote, which has been supposed 
to be more correct than the former, as exa- 
mined by Scheele and Lavoisier, their me- 
thods of examination not being susceptible 
of precision. 

Further, it does not seem that atmosphe* 
TIC air is altered in its composition fron» 
whatever height it may be brought for exa- 
mination ; for Lussac examined air brought 
from the height of more than 21,000 feet 
above Paris, and found it precisely the same 
as the air at the earth's sur&ce. Air, when 
examined by De Marti's Eudiometer^ is 
found to be similarly diminished* Under 
whatever circumstances the experiments are 
made, in whatever part of the world it may 
be examined, no variation is observed, whe- 
ther the wind be high or low, or from what- 
ever quarter it blows ; whether the air be 
moist or dry, hot or cold, at whatever time 
of the day or night ; or whether the baro- 
meter be high or low. Neither the season 
of the year, nor the situation of the place, 
its vicinity to the sea, to marshes, or to 
mountains, make the slightest difference. 

The generality of modern chemists are ©f 
opinion, that the component principles of at- 
mospheric air are what they term chemicalk/ 
combined. They, at the same time, allow,, 
that, independent of this combination, it pos- 



41 



MgSM no quaKties different from those of its 
constituent parts, nor do they appear to be 
altered further than by mere dilution^ as 
these coQStituents mix equally well, and re- 
main diffused through each other, in every 
possible propOTtion ; nor is a change of tern- 
pevature observed as an indication of ai^ 

. chemical action between them. , 

Mr Dalton has proposed a mechanical 
theory of the constitution of the atmosphere 

: on the principle that it is merely a mixtuie 
of the azotic and oxygenous gases of which 

. it is composed, which accounts for the fact 
apparently irreconcilable with the chemical 
hypothesis. 

In support of their respective opinions, 
|he chemical and mechanical philosophers 

. have each exerted their ingenuity in account- 
ing for the composition of the : atmosphere. 
In opposition to Mr Dalton's theory, it has 
been supposed, from the phenomena of affi- 

. nity, that an attraction may be exerted be- 
tween substances, so as to unite them inti- 
mately, though it he-insufficient entirely to 
overcome opposing forces ; and they think, 
that a further assumption will not surely be 

' regarded as improbable, namely, that this 
attraction may counteract the difference in 

.the specific gravities of these substances, 
. especially where it is not considerable^ and 



A2 



prevent them ffom separating finom eachy 
other. 

The mixture of nearly one part c£oxygen^ 
ous air^ and three parts of azotic gas, which, 
forms the atmosphere, is the best prop<MrtioiL 
of ingredients for the maintenance of life i 
lor we find that, with a smaller propoitkxi, 
of oxygen, not only respiration becomes on*, 
j^easant and laborious, but debiKty, ccxivul- 
sions, and other bad effects are produced ; ' 
anc^ on the other hand, we find, that bad 
symptoms of exactly an oppoate kind art. 
broi^ht on by a greater proportion of it, vis. 
a pretematuraL heat, increased pulsation^ 
pain, inflammation, &c. 

As there is a tendency constantly to de* 
stroy this regularity in the constitution of 
of the atmospheiiie, by the variety of chaises 
which are continually going on at the earth's, 
surface, so there is an equal tendency, by the 
same means, and by the change also g<»ng 
on in the atmosphere itself, to repair its losses^ 

Thus, admirably, the omnipotent CreatcMr^ 
of the universe displays equal omnipotence, 
in beautifully counterbalancing the various 
operations of nature, and in preserving un- 
impaired the constitution and harmony of 
the whole. 

The air, however, it is well known, is ca- 
pable of uniting with a great variety of suIk 



43 



vtsDces. Indeed, it never does appear In a 
pure state, but always has in it a considenu 
tie fldfliixtnre of foreign bodies. Substan- 
pei thus held in s(dution in the atmosphere 
often assume the elastic fcMtn, and among 
these some are the principle of odours : hi- 
therto, however, these emanations have 
escaped chemical means, which, though they 
can destroy some, do not enable us to ex- 
pfadn their nature. 

' Hence, we must ccmclude, that the at- 
mosphere IS a e&oof, consisting not only of 
aplastic, but also of unelastic substances, 
Wfaicb, in great plen^, float in it, as well as 
of watery, saline and earthy particles, which 
SK inca^nble of being thrown off in a per- 
manently elastic form, like those particles 
which properiy constitute the air. Thus, 
tiier efore, the air may be considered as the 
' great instrument of nature, by which a ge- 
neral frircnhtion of matter is maintained, 
and by which not only water is every where 
diqsersed, bat often the eggs of insects, and 
|be seeds of plants, are conveyed from place 
to place. Both of these have been fomid in 
nnn water, in examining^ it carefully jxist af- 
ter it has hUtax ; zad indeed we ^omeutnei 
find insects arx! plants in lorne ^hca wher<: 



44 



for, otherwise than by supposing theiF eggf 
and seeds to be conveyed by the air. 

Mr Dalton is of opinion^ that the presence 
of the^atmosphere is an obstacle, not to th^ 
formation, but to the diffusion, of these va- 
pours, a diffusion which he thinks would 
take place instantaneously, as in a vacuum^ 
if the moleculae of the air did not oppose it 
by their inaction. 
Weight of The weight of the atmosphere depends on 
ihcw!""'' ^'^ density and height. Where its weight 
is greatest, its height is least ; and, on the 
contrary, where its density is least, its height 
is greatest. Now,, it is supposed that this 
elastic fluid floats equally around our planet 
to the distance of at least 45 miles of perpen-^ 
dicular elevation. Upon the body of a man 
of middle stature, therefore, its weight is 
equal to 32 or 33,000 pounds ; but in rainy 
and variable weather, and especially on the * 
summit of high mountains, there is a dimi- 
nution in its pressure of many thousand 
pounds. 

It has been calculated, that the mean 
weight of the atmosphere amounts to about 
1 1,91 J, i 63,227,258, 18 1,8 18 lbs. avoirdu- 
pois. It is therefore 81 6 times lighter than 
water. 

In Lavoisier's examination of the efiects 
of the pressure of the atmosphere, opposed 



45 



to the action of caloric^ that philosopher tt^ 
marks^ that without it the moleculae woald 
be infinitely dispersed ; and that nothing 
would limit their separation, did not their 
own weight in a manner collect them so as 
to form an atmosphere. 

As the earth is the chief source of JirfSf Ac 
heat in the surrounding atmosphere, dis- Atmos. 
tance from the earth must be a source of 
cold ; or, in other words, the greatest cold 
must prevail in the highest regions of the 
atmosphere ; for heat is observed to dimi- 
nish in ascending into the atmosphere, 
nearly in an arithmetical progression. Clear 
unclouded air seems to receive no heat what- 
ever from the rays of the sun, whether di- 
rect or reflected. 

The coldest weather, in every latitude, 
generally prevails about the middle of Janu* 
ary ; and the warmest weather, in all lati- 
tudes above 48®, during the month of July ; 
but, in lower latitudes, August is generally 
warmest. Reckoning astronomically, the 
greatest cold ought to be felt at the latter 
end of December ; and the greatest heat 
in the end of June ; but the earth requires 
some time to receive, or to lose, the in- 
fluence of the sun, in the same manner as 
the sea, with respect to tides, does that of 
the moon.

The standard temperature 
is 59^ ; Montpelier is there* 
fore 1,87 degrees warmer than 
the standard. ltd distance 
from the Atlantic is 260 miles 
by which it should be cooled 
1 .6 degrees ; but its tempe* 
rature is governed chiefly by 
that of the Mediterranean^ 
which, lying to the south of 
of it, in still warmer latitudes, 
communicates its tempera* 



mer and winter 



ture to it, during both sum^ 
winters, however, during which 
easterly winds from the mountains of i9avoy and 
Piedmont prevail, milst be miich colder. The soil 
on which Montpelier stands, which is saiidy and 
stony^ must also much contribute to its heat. 

That the temperature of the air, howe- 
ver, varies considerably, not only in differ- 
ent climates, and in different seasons, but 
even in the same place, atid during the same 
season, must be obvious to the most care- 
less observer. This perpetual variation 
cannot be ascribed to the direct heat of the 



t3 



ton:: for its rays^ though ever so much 
obncentrated^ seem to produce no effect 
whatever upon air; they therefore merely, 
warm the surface of the earth* which com- 
municates its heat to the surrounding at« 
^nosphere. 

It seems undoubtedly owing to the dif« 
felt^nt degrees of cultivation in different 
countries that we are to attribute the alter- 
ation which has toroetimes taken place in 
Ih^r temperature. As an example^ we may 
mention the northern countries of Europe^ 
which are far warmer now than they were 
iieariy 2000 years ago 4 for though Italy^ 
fbr instance, might have been as well culti-^ 
Vated then ^s at present, yet Grermany was 
covered with woods, and consequently the 
winds that passed from it to Italy were far 
colder. 

The effects of these different states of 
cultivation may thus be felt at an immense 
distance. We know that Siberia is 2800 
miles to the east of London ; but, accord- 
ing to the computation of Mr Smeaton, a 
common high wind moves at the rate of 35 
miles an hour, and therefore may pass thence 
to us in three days. Now, Sir Charles Blag- 
den has shewn, that a current of 20 leagues^ 
in breadth, and ten degrees warmer than 
the ocean^ through which it flows, may pre- 



4& 



serve four degrees of its heat, after it has, 
traversed a space of 7 or 800 miles. And . 
Sir Benjamin Thomson has proved, that air 
is a much worse conductor of heat than wa- 
ter; therefore we may well suppose, that 
the Siberian winds may preserve much of 
their original temperature oh arriving here ; 
particularly if they blow with considerable, 
force, and last during some days. 

Many proofs may be adduced of the e£*, 
fects of cultivation on climate, but I need 
only remark, that even the uncultivated parts 
of America are at present much more t^od-; 
perate than they were a century ago ; and 
doubtless, when that country is still further 
cleared of woods, its climate will be still 
further improved, though, from the situation 
of the high lands, it can never be so mode* 
rate as that of Europe. 

I may finish this part of the subject by 
observing, that the drying effects of the at- 
mosphere are owing to its heat, which causes 
the watery vapours contained in bodies to 
ascend. 
Winds. It is the change of temperature that chief- 
ly occasions the vicissitudes of winds ; these 
in their turn, however, influence tempera-, 
ture. 

The effects of the winds in our temperate 
climate are^ comparatively speaking, scarce- 



^ 



l/jfelL On the coast of Africa, on the con^ 
tnuyi the ^ winds blow so very, hot from the 
Jimd^'tbat they can be compared to nothmg 
)Mit the heat prooeediog from the mouth <^ 
an oven ; and they also bring with them a 
ameiL that is quite intolerable. Some of these 
terrible winds are of so drying and hot a na^ 
tufe, that the wolves, tigers, lions &c. goto 
the rivers, and lay their whole bodies under 
water,' leaving only their nostrils above it for 
tfa^ purpose of breathing. The birds, like* 
wa^ts, spar to an immense height, or fly a 
vast way over the sea, where they continue 
until^ the wind changes to the west« 

A general cause of humidity in the at*- Vapours 
mosphere is imperfect ventilation^ Where, *^ *^ 
fiir instance, there are no hills to direct the 
winds in streams upon the lower grounds, 
the air is apt to stagnate; particularly if 
there exist in the same place large planta- 
tions. , . ^ : 

I know not what credjt is to be given to 
an jassertion which I have seen in some 
works, that the east wind in England not 
only; uniformly brings with it a fog firom the 
aea:; but that this wind, in many places of 
the. island, frequently raises a copious vapoujr 
from water, mud, and all marshy and damp

Fernelius relates, that near the time he 
Iwrote, one year was throughout th^ ii^orld im - 
'.fnoderately hot, and was yet strikingly b^altb^ *

That hot- dry weather certainly is unfa- 
vburaMe to the propagation of contagion, is 
^ hct well ascertained by writers on epide^ 
mical diseases, and unanimously maintained 
by those who treat of the diseases of tropical 
-climates. 

As an instsmce of a moderate cliamte, 
.i^e may adduce the Canaries, which are 
Messed with a teftip^hrte, pure, and whole- 
some air. No 806n£r are sick persons land* 
ed there, than they find an immediate and 
«itis&Gtory alteration in their health.

seasons or tlie year, and live to as great an 
age as in Europe. 

Hence, it would appear, that those coun* 
tries most productive of diseases are such as 
are warm and moist, cold and moist, or 
subject to sudden and great alterations: c^ 
temperature. 
Alterations , The quality of common air is not altered 
oS!lhrAt- by merely heating or cooling,. or by being 
inosphcrc. fQj. ^ time loaded with the vapour of water, 
nor by rarefaction or condensation. ...It 
is contaminated principally by combustion^ 
by the fermentation and putrefaction of ani- 
mal and vegetable bodies, by the cakizifr- 
. tion of metallic substances, by the presence 
of vegetables when they are not under the 
influence of the sun*s rays^ by respiratjpo^ 
iand by the admixture of ev^ry other gas, or 
permanently elastic fluid, except oxygen* 

Thus, by these operations constantly car- 
rying on at the surface of the earth, atmos- 
pheric air is suffering constant changes; 
its oxygen is consun\^^f#nd carbonic aci^ 
and various other gases^^^e disengaged, and 
communicated to it. 
oMMcd^'b^ That all living matter possesses or genc^ 
Vcjgetatioii rates heat in a certain degree, is, I believe^ 
pretty generally acknowledged. Of this we 
have munerous and incontrovertible proo£^ 



53 



not only in the animal^ but in the vegetable 
world. 

The sudden thaw of snow lying on 
gra^) while that on adjoining gravel con- 
tinues unthawed ; the fact of the moisture 
of dead sticks freezing, while the sap of grow- 
ing twigs is not at all affected ; and of her- 
baceous plants often resisting degrees of cold 
which freeze large bodies of water; all 
these seem to shew^ that vegetables possess 
a power of generating heat. 

During the process of malting, too, a 
considerable production of temperature takes 
place ; so great, indeed, that, in certain cir- 
cumstances, grain improperly kept has even 
taken fire. From this fact we conclude^ 
that during the germination of seeds in the 
earth, a production of temperature likewise 
takes place. 

Air is not only necessary to the growth of 
seeds, but the ordinary state of its composi- 
tion is also the best adapted to produce vi-^ 
gorous germination. 

Without it, then, pUnts do not vegetate, 
and as, even although air be supplied, they . 
cease also to grow when deprived of leaves, 
we must conclude, not only that air is essen- 
tial to the growth, of plants, but that their 
leaved are the orgdx&'hy which tlie^y inhale 

it.- •-. .

It is thought by eothe, that the vegetation 
of healthy plants, growing in situations nft» 
tural to them^ has a salutary effect op the 
ain This certaikily seems a very probable 
circumstance. 

Dr Priestly, however, found, that whether 

the air had been injured by respiration, the 

burning of candles, or other means, it WM 

tiot rendered better by vegetation, but worsey 

and the lortger the plants continued in diet 

air, the worse it became. This question If 

therefore still undecided. 

Alterations ft appears that the atmosphere, as natu*^ 

by Respi- rally Composed, is best adapted to the ecd*; 

ration. nomy of the animal system; but that this 

system is, at the same time, so constituted ai 

to be able to bear great variations ih thd 

composition of the a'u*, without iimnediato 

injury to life. 

When, however, this variation proceeds 
to a certain extent, the air is no longer ca« 
pable of supporting vital action ; though 
different animals, when confined in giveq 
Tolumes of air, possess the power of pro-* 
longing this action in different degrees. 

Borelli estimated: the bulk of air taken in 
at a single inspiration at IS culnc inchest 
Mr ELite^ from 12 to ijj; Dr Goodwyti at 
14 ; Mr Davy from '18 to 17 ; Drs Turing 
Hales, Haller and Sauvages, at 40 cubi( 



5& 



htches. W ith the coticladion of these later 
authors, the experitnents of Dr Menzies 
neariy coincide. Dr Bostock also thinks, 
that AQ cubic inphes is the quantity of air 
^in{)loyed in each ordinary act of respiraw 
fion. 

When atmospheric ah* is respired by ani- 
mals, its bulk is diminished, and its qualities 
arealteredi The diminution of bulk was 
noticed even by Boyle, who estinhated it at 
About Tfs p^rt of the air employed^ Mdy- 
how thought that it was reduced to ^ of 
ite previous bulk. In the experiments of 
Dr Hales, t|;e degree of diminution varied 
from -^ to 1^ of the air employed ; and in 
these of Lavoisier from -ittoi^ part ; with 
nj^hich the experimerfts of Groodwyn nearly 

coincide. 

Even insects consume the oxygenous 
fiart of the air; carbonic acid is, at the same 
\\tn9% produced by them ; and when all the 
OxygfeH hds disappeared, these animals die. 
These facts are now considered as prov- 
ing, not only that the carbon, which decom- 
poses- the air, is furnished by the anima), bul 
that its emission depends entil'ely on the 
state of the circulating fluids ; for, as cir-^ 
culation increases, declines, or ceases, so 
likewise does the emission of carbon, and 
%h6 consequent productioiA)f carbonic acid \

the oxygen gas cannot vary the result^ be- 
ings in all cases, equally abundant. 

In the several processes, then, of germi- 
nation, vegetation, and respiration, it is 
^evident, that, as carbonic acid is formed, the 
oxygenous portion of the air gradually and 
completely disappears; and that the acid 
produced bears always a constant proportion 
to the oxygen gas lost. It is therefore evi« 
dent that these processes, by CQmbining it 
with carbon^ convert the oxygen gas into 
carbonic acid. 
These ai- ^\\ jhe alterations which thus result from 

terations 

reducible tlicse proccsscs are reducible to certain 
inthe^c^!. changes in the composition of the atmo« 
position of sphere, and a great variety of others which

Import. When philosophy had emerged from that 

consider, d^rkness by which it had long been veiled^ 
ing their and natural causes began, of course^ to ba 
investigated, the atmosphere was naturally 
one of the first which attracted attention ; 
and whenever diseases became epidemic^ and 
no visible cfliuse of this could be assigned^ 
they were thought to derive their origin from 
certain mysterious qualities of the atmos«, 
phere* Though these opinions, like alt 
those i^hich at aA^ tim^ have (ended tQ th^ 



57 



improvement of science, bad powerful op- 
ponents and powerful abettors, even yet tbey 
remain undetermined. 

We are, bowever, instinctively taugbt to 
consider a pure air as one of tbe greatest 
sources of bealtb^ and an impure air as one 
of the greatest sources of disease ; and to 
attribute to its variouc cbanges, and to the 
various particles which are continually float- 
ing in it, the causes of many of those wide- ' 
ly spreading and mortal diseases, whose ori- 
gin we cannot otherwise account for. * 
, Whatever, therefore, the precise nature of 
these changes may be, the purity of the at- 
mosphere has always been considered fa- 
vourable to health in every age and situation 
of life. A pure air has also been esteemed 
favourable to the functions of tbe mind, so 
intimately connected with those of the bo- 
<ly. Every one must from experience be sa- 
tified of this beneficial effect of pure air up* 
on the mental powers, and how greatly they 
are elevated and improved by it, while the 
unfavourable ^ects of ap impure air on 
these powers must have been ^s evidently 
felt. 

A general sickness may most certainly be 
produced by sonie latent intemperature of 
the atmosphere, t^he sources of which cannot 
isasi^ be traced ;jieither is it ^Iwgys easy.

from the sensible alterations in the air^ as to 
heat^ cold, and moisture, to account for the 
greater violence of endemic diseases in some 
seasons than in others. For oft

Is big with death. And tho' the putrid south

The causes, then, of all epidemics, as well 
as fevers, small pocks, dysenteries, 6cc. eicist 
in that universal fluid— ^the atmosphere, of 
which, as out- common food, we all alike 
share. These noxipus miasmata may float 
in the atmosphere, sometimes in greater 
quantities, sometimes in less : aiid (jorise^ 
quently produce their ill efiects by propor- 
tional degrees of infection. Perhaps, alsOi 
their powers and operations may be height-* 
ened or depressed, according to the differ^ 
ent states of the air. As either or bpth iheiA 
causes prevail, we may justly aup{)Osei 
epidemics to appear with more or less rage 
and frequency. 

I thus consider every degree of contami- 
nation that the atmospheric air is capable bF 
suffering, as forming, from whatever cau86 
it may arise^ a source of disease. Habit

wiH^ doubtless^ g;o a great length in ^nablifig 
people to sustain^ with apparent impunity, 
depravations of almost every kind ; but this 
does not in the smallest degree lessen the 
troth of my assertion. 

These deviatiodi from the air's standard 
of purity may arise from various causes, and 
afiect particular parts of the system accord- 
ing to the susceptibility of these parts in re« 
eeivingy and t;heir capability of supporting, 
diseased action. When parts are thus af^ 
fected, either the whole body, or individual 
portions of it, mayexhibit proofs of the injury 
they have sustained. 

' The nature and ^Verity of duch diseases 
eeiftainly depend, ist, On the nature and 
degree of change which may have taken 
place in the atmosphere. 2^, On the parti-» 
cular qualities of the foreign matter which 
tnay be combined with the atmosphere. 
And^ ddty. On the nature of the climate in 
which one or both of these changes may 
take place. 

From certain states of the soil, as already 
observed^ the strata of air successively appli*- 
ed to it may suffer very considerable change. 
In warmer, as well as in more temperate clu- 
mated, these changes are continually going 
pn. In warmer climates, however, their fa^ 
^ electa are generally more if)^dy than in 






60 



colder ones, where the unhappy suflerer is 
often doomed to drag out aiong and miser* 
able life, groaning under a slow, but gradu- 
ally accumulating, load of diseases, which 
are nevertheless equally certain of terminat- 
ing his existence, with those more speedy 
affections of warmer climes. 

Modem chemists have endeavoured to 
prove by experiment, that the peculiar qua- 
lity by which diseases are propagated, is not 
discoverable by them in their analysis of at- 
mospheric air ; they therefore believe it to 
be a quality of too subtile a nature to be de» 
tected in our present state of knowledge, by 
any chemical agent with which we are ac- 
quainted. In order to put this matter be- 
yond doubt, they have analysed atnu)spheric 
air in every state, from its greatest purity to 
its utmost degree of contamination ; and 
have found the component parts of it, in all 
the varieties of both these states, to be ex? 
actly the tsanfie. From these examinations^ 
the above conclusion has been drawn. But 
if they had given themselves the trouble to 
recollect that putrid effluvia are not perhaps 
subject to the same laws with atmospjieric 
air, and therefpre can never \^ discovered 
by the same experiments, they would at once 
have seen the source of their mistake. T(ie 
air of oi|r atpoiospher^, therefore, is not, un.^ 



61 



■iier these circumstances, vkiated in its qua- 
lities : an additional substance, is added 
to it, hot chemically combined with it. 

Therefore^ when we say that the air is 
pestilent, we do not understand that to be 
M it is of its own nature ; for as such, it is 
not subject to putre&ction ; but as polluted 
' ¥rith noxious vapours arising from the earthy 
standing waters, vaults, &c. Now, certain- 
ly, among alUhe constitutions of the air, caU 
ciliated to receive and disseminate pestilential 
ei&uvia, there is none more fit than hot, motst 
aad still seasons. Its effects, therefore, jn 
producing disease, must, for the most part, 
arise rather in consequence of additions 
made to, it, than from any alteration in its 
. constituent parts, 
. Thus altered, then, tt would appear that 
different animals seem, from their peculiarity 
of structure, state of bealth, &c. to be dif- 
ferently affected by noxious efRuvia, fis difr- 
^ent substances are capable of being dif- 
ferently affected by heat, moisture, &c. 

}t is also well known to surgeons, that 
d^erent states of the atmosphere, contri*- 
bute very greatly to retard or to promote the 
healing process. 

Thus flesh wounds^ simple fractures and 
dislocations, may. be cured with almost equal 
ease in any situation^ while violent contu- 



6a 



iiiens and burns^ wounds of nervous and 
membraneous parts, compound fractures 
and the like, are rendered peculiarly dail* 
gerous and difficult of cure by contaminated 
air. 

Diseases of a more general nature, too, are 
: greatly influenced by particular states of tbe 
tair. Whoever will, for instance, peruse tfab 
account of many campaigns, will fiee such 
a uqiformity in the rise and perioids of dis- 
eases, and these so much connected with 
the state of the air, as to be convinced, that 
.neither the abuse of spirits, nor of fruit, mH* 
the drinking of bad water, could have so 
considerable a share in producing them. 

Therefore it is, in a great measure, to be 
imputed to the alterations our bodies under- 
go from the weather, in the several seasons 
of the year, that we are liable to such a di- 
versity of distempers as often prevails a- 
mongst us. We must have observed, that 
when the season is very inconstant, a variety 
of complaints and confusion in their symp- 
toms will ensue, according as various habits 
may be acted upon by such a mixture of im^ 
pressions.

that the greater the extent of evaporating

greater must be the proportion evapqratedi 
Upon this subject, if we are to believe Mr 






64 



Williams^ the evaporation from the sur&ce 
. of ]and covered with tre^ and other vege« 
tables, is one-third greater than from the 
surface of water ; hut this has not been con- 
firmed. 

In the present enquiry, it is unnecessary 
to examine this point particularly: I shall 
therefore merely mention, that water may 
be contained in the air in two states ; in tiiat 
of soliuitm, and in that of diffusion ; and it is 
the latter of these that we denominate, a m(uat 
atmosphere. This vapour is held in solu- 
tion by the air, precisely as one .species of 
gas is by another. Hence the reason why 
it is so difficult to separate it, and why it is 
capable of undergoing a considerable degriee 
of compression without assuming the form 
of a liquid. 

The vapour of water is, like common auv 
an elastic invisible fluid, but lighter, being, 
to conf mo'n air of the same elasticity, ao*. 
cording to Saussure, as 10 to 14, or accprd- 
ing to Kirwan, as 10 to 12. 

To the formation of vapour, atmospheric 
air is not absolutely necessary, as that pro- 
cess cannot take place in vacuo. 
Fixed Air. Fixed air, or carbonic acid gas is likewise 
often found in the atmosphere in consider-

Several varieties of the carburetted gssea 
e^ist, bearing, in their properties, a gene- 
ral resemblance, but still capable of be- 
ing discriminated. The one which has been 
longest known, is that which is obtained 
when water is decomposed by charcoal at 
the temperature of ignition. It was dis- 
covered by Dr Priestly, who gave it the 
name of heavy inflammable air. In the new 
nomenclature, it has been named, from Tts 
composition, carbonated- hydrogen, or hy- 
dro-carbonate, a name proposed to be altered 
by Mr Chenevix to carburetted- hydrogen. 

In the decomposition of certain vegetable 
products by heat, other species of carburet- 
ted-hydrogen are obtained, differing little in 
their properties. The vapours of camphor, 
alcohol and ether, passed through a red-hol 
tube, give somewhat similar gasea. 

Mr Cruickshank observed, that the gas 
arising from marshes, disengaged in all probft* 
bility by the slow decomposition of vegeta- 
ble matter, is similar to the gases obtained 
from the decomposition of camphor, aJeo- 
hol, or ether, by heat.

It is generally thought^ that the : atim^

marksi in: so far as it is there affected by affi- 
nities^ and in a state of combination. 

Therexan be little doubt, but that it is the 
whole body of the air, which is charged with 
these corpuscles ; for if this capacity resid* 
ed exclusively in oxygen or azote, the pro- 
portions of these elements would undergo 
a change, in the same manner as happens 
when air is in contact with substances dis* 
posed for acidification or oxydation ; where- 
as eudiometric experiments jindicate no sen- 
sible .alteration Jn air shut up in close vessels 
with musk, assafoetida^ opium and other sub- 
stances equally odorous, provided the latter 
be kept apart from every matter susceptible 
ofj fermeji tation, and consequently of oxy-

. 6ome have supposed, that odours had no 
boundaries, or could not be defined, and 
that they possessed only vague characters ; 
others have maintained, that similar odours 
indicated similar powers, of which the ef-

gree of their concentration, or of the sensibi-^ 
Uty of the organ of smell.

heat of the air, that these vapours are diffiok

at the sametime it retains such a beat, as 
also prevents their coalescing and descend^ 
ing in the night, even in the form of dews,

Cold. With regard to cold, it is known that 
damp air is always colder than dry, suppos- 
ing the same wind to blow, and with an 
equal force. 

At Quebec, pleurisies arid other inflam- 
matory disorders, are the genuine produce 
G^ the cold air of that climate ; while low, 
! bilious, and intermittent fevers fire scarcely 
ever known there. 

In may also, in a great measure, be ow- 
' ing to the influence of cold, that the pesti- 
lential disease of yellow fev^r puts off i|a 
malignant disposition by degrees as the cpol 
season advances, and is no more seen whep 
the air is frosty ot a fe\v degrees colder than 
pur blood,

.tr>res have properly two seasons, the wet anjl 
the dry ; the former beifig commonly qf 
aty)ut four months continuance, and the 
sea^QO of sickness ; whereas, for maoiy 
inpntbs of the dry season, many parts ^^ijf 
these countries are equally healthy and plea- 
sant with any in the woi?ld. * : ■ "

lA a more mode^'ate degree, a dry season is, 
upon the whole, more healthful than a wet 
one*' ' This must, however, be understood in 
fa limited sense ; for, upon a review of the 
-biljs of mortality kept in Dublin for forty 
years, it appears, that the number of per- 
sons buried was remarkably greatest in dry 
years* 

r In opposition to this again, J may men- 
tion, that it is a very common observation 
in the East Indies, that during the dry heats 
.the season is healthful ; but whefi the rains 
All immediately upon the hot weather, then 
i£?vers occur. The same is observed in 
Africa. 

The island of Sardinia is annually visited 
by an epidemical sickness, whioh rages 
irom June till September, and is calledA)y the 
natives Intemperies. In some -summers, 
4bere is a want of rain for four or five 
monthSj and then it is that this sickness is 
most violent, being always more fatal in some 
places than in others, and particularly so tp 
atrangers. : .

With regard to moisture, it may be ob- 
served, that, in the Bay of Mexico, shoals of 
large and ravenous sliarks crowding into the 
harbours, and the appearance of dark thick 
clouds to the southward, with thunder and 
lightning, slowly approaching, indicate the 
commencement of the sickly season, and are 
the awful preludes of those impetuous torFcnts 
which, in a few days, are to burst from the 
clouds, and inundate the whole face of the 
country. It would appear, that these tor- 
rents of tropical countries are injurious to 
the health of the natives, for they (especial- 
ly the mulattoes) avoid being exposed ki 
those rains as much as possible ; and, when 
■wet by them, immediately plunge into salt 
■water if near it. But, indeed, in every 
country, though perhaps not to such a de- 
gree as in tropical ones, there is a healthy 
and a sickly season, and diseases are gene- 
rally most prevalent after heavy rains. 

Simple moisture of itself seems harmless, 
at least so far as relates to the production of 
fevers. And humid as the climate of Ire- 
land is, it seems to be a well authorised 
fact, that there is no disease peculiar to 



Dr Rutty observes, that, from a registry of 
the weather for 43 years, he found the fair 
days in Ireland were not a third of the year, 



rs 



mh&tlt in Sngland the dry days are nearly 
two to one. 

This iiioUture of the climate is attributed 
to the exposure of Ireland to the Atkntio 
ooeaiiy in which it operates as a screen to 
England; and to this almost constant mois^ 
tw^ may be attributed the vivid verdure of 
ilB^ fields and meadows. 

This climate is so salubrious^ tiiat we find^ 
in biatof y^ that those plagues which $o mucl| 
derailed Bngland^ but rarely reached Ire« 
land. The leaves^ also^ seldom fall from the 
treet before November^ but the fruit is ge» 
liendly of a very inferior flavour^ owing pro- 
b^ly to this moisture of climate* 

It is also supposed that it is the moisture 
ef the Irish climate which is fetal to venem*

eus animals. 

When dampness is the immediate cause 
qf ' disease^ it is prc^bly owing to its dimi- 
nixing, or almost entirely $topping perspi* 
ration^ and thus debilitating the system^ and 
rendering it less capable of resisting morbid 
eontagion» 

It is a curious fact^ that, in the countries 
between the tropics, heavy and continual 
r^ns produce sickness, while in other pla- 
ces, especially in the northern parts of EkH"^ 
rope, want of rains brings on diseases almost 
similar* 



76 



Cold dampness, particularly if the .wiod 
blow from the east, affects both animal and 
vegetable health, and produces many obsti- 
nate diseases, as well as occasions, relapses. 
Pains of rheumatism, too, and corns on the 
feet, become troublesome on similar occa- 
sions. And even cold and moist air, or sud* 
den thaw affecting the body in the iyinter> 
produce not only inflammatory disorders, 
but cause relapses into such distempers as 
people had been affected with during the 
end of summer and harvest. It is this' 
which renders Hungary so unhealthy to an 
army in the field, where the cold damp nights 
succeed sultry days. 

History informs us also, that epidemic 
diseases have ever . been prevalent in moist 
weather, but more remarkably .frequent io 
the autumnal months, when a summer unu- 
sually warm and dry has been succeeded by 
an extraordinary rainy season ; that our 
fleets and armies have ever been greatly a& 
flicted by them ; and though they still con- 
tinue to be severely felt in this country, 
thjey have formerly raged here with much 
greater violence. 
MoUiurc When moisture is added to heat, com- 
plaints become bpth more frequent and 
more virulent in their nature. About the 
months of August and Septemberj whea

safe as long^ as this season lasts : whereas, 
should the air be sultry and moist, the dis-; 
ease will hardly be removed without a perse«> 
verance in tlie use of that or some similar 
medicine. 

From these and similar circumstances, > it. 
will be perceived how much the severity or 
mildness of complaints, as well as the medi^ 
cines used rfor their removal, depend oa 
seemingly trifling changes in the state of the 
climate. 



78 



With respect to heat and moisture, 
Lind also seems to be of opinion, that suci 
a state of atmosphere is most favourable to 
the rise and progress of acute putrid diseas- 
es, and that cold and moisture are 
favourable to slow chronic ones. 

As a continuation of wannth andhutnull? 
ty in the atmosphere has generally been ob- 
served to precede epidemics of the putrid 
kind, so in a low damp country, the same 
kind of diseases are generally endemic. 
All, therefore, that states of the atmosphere 
do, is to predispose the body for the recep- 
tion of such infection as, when applied, 
produces disease ; whereas in a dry-warm, 
or in a dry-cold state of it, no morbid 
affection would have been produced. 
Plagues also abate something of their seve- 
rity in warm dry weather, and generally al- 
most entirely cease in cold dry, and fros- 
ty weather. 

In a hot and moist state of the atmos- 
phere, animal and vegetable matters run 
more quifjkly into putrefaction. It has been 
already observed, that matters unfavour^le 
to health are generated from these souroes, 
and that they seem to be possessed of a dfe 
gree of virulence in proportion to the 
and moisture of the climate.

The years 1765,-6^ Dr Lind observes^' 
were distinguished by an uncommon appear*-

in most parts of England. During th6' 
months of May, June, and July, there were 
seldom at Haslar hospital less than 30 or 40 
patients, labouring under regular tertian 
agues, with perfect intermissions. Of these^ 
some were seized with it on board the guard

rally ascribed, and probably with reason, to 
the thickness and moisture of the air ; and 
is, on that account, by Cicero, adduced in 
opposition to the clear dry air, and acute 
and lively genius of Athens. The same is, 
doubtless, one of the causes of the apathy 
and insensibility of the North American In- 
dians, who live in a country which, from its 
uncultivated state, is over-run with woods 
and marshes ; and the air of which must 
consequently be replete with effluvia of this 
kind. If this supposition be true, it will, in 
some measure, account for the improvement 
of the genius of the people, from that of the 
soil and climate of the country itself. 
J Bencoolen, too, it is observed, is more 
unhealthy than either Madras, Bengal, or 
Bombay. Bengal is next unhealthy, parti- 
cularly during and after the rainy season, 
which commences in June, and continues 
till October. The diseases of the country, 
which are fevers of a remitting and inter- 
mitting kind, particularly attack those new- 
ly arrived- In very sickly seasons, malig- 
nant fever is the most common, and the bo- 
dy is covered with bloaches of a livid hue. 
Fluxes then also prevail. The air of Bom- 
bay is not so pure as that of Madras, yet it 
is more wholesome than that of BengaL

3 voyage to the Havannah in 1799- After 
a storm, the weather became extremely hot, 
and putrefaction of some of their provision 
took place to such an extent, that the air in 
the hold, and other parts of the vessel, was 
contaminated so as to extinguish lights im- 
mediately. In a few days, the first man who 
was seized was affected by symptoms of a 
highly inflammatory bilious fever, — such as 
violent pains in the head and bones, suffu- 
sion of the face and eyes, hardness and ve- 
locity of pulse, prostration of strength, 
great thirst, vomiting, and costiveness. The 
symptoms of others, however, who were af- 
fected by, and afterwards died of it, sood 
assumed the actual appearance of well mark- 
ed yellow fever, precisely such as it is de- 
scribed by authors. They had, during this 
voyage, no communication with vessel, 
town, or port, so that this disease was gene- 
rated with themselves, and its surprising 
change must have been the consequence of 
change of climate. 

In the West Indies, the diseases that prove 
fatal to soldiers, and Europeans in general, 
are of two kinds, namely, fevers and fluxes. 
These are the concomitants of armies in all 
parts of the world, but in tropical climates 
they are well known to rage with peculiar 
violence. There appears to be an intimate 



97 



connection between them> for they are fre- 
quently combined together, often inter- 
^ange with each other, and it rarely hap- 
pens that one is epidemic without the other. 
They eeem to depend upon the same cause> 
peiiiaps differently modified. The fevers 
are similar to what have been called remit- 
tent ; but greatly more violent in their at<- 
tack, quicker in their progress, and more fa- 
tal in their termination, than what are ever 
seen by us in Europe. They proceed from 
the same cause, noxious exhalations from 
wet, low, and marshy grounds. 

Towards the production of such noxious 
vapours, there- appears to be necessary the 
concurrence of three circumstances, heat> 
moisture, and decayed vegetable matter. 

What renders Jamaica more particularly 
unhealthy is, that marsh effluvia, owing to 
the particular state of the climate, constant- 
ly exist there ; whilst in northern climates 
they only exist during the heat of summer, 
when it is observed that they are uniformly 
unhealthy. In Jamaica, the most healthy 
apots are the dry and sandy, where there is 
little decayed animal and vegetable matter, 
and where the rain is absorbed by the earth. 
Dry, elevated, and mountainous places, too^ 
n^re generally healthy ; the decayed anim^

that does not contain some places, where 
Europeans may enjoy an uninterrupted state

Previous to considering the influence of 
particular situations in producing disease^ it 
is necessary, as introductory ta it, to ex* 
plain, that the sources of disease are never 
found to act but when we approach close*' 
]y to them ; that is, either near to tte 
bodies of men, from which they may imme-' 
diately issue ; or near substances which, aa 
having been in contact with the bodies of 
men, are imbued with their effluvia, and in 
which these effluvia are sometimes retained 
in an active state for a very kmg timb. I may 
mention, that even the most unhealthy spots < 
in the world have in their neighbourhood, 
and often at no great distance from them^ > 
places which afford a secure retreat and pro^* 
tection from disease and death. In a wcnrd, 
the diseases most &tal to strangers in every 
country, seem not merely to be confined to 
particular seasons, but, even during *tbeM' 
seasons, to certain places only. Indeed, ' 
were not the matter of contagion continual* 
]y regenerated, it would soon, become per«9 
fectly inert, as it has been found, that when 
very unwholesome air is even conveyed to a * 
great distance, and much time ebpsea he^l 



91 



fbre it is tried^ it approaches, by some means 
or other^ to the state of wholesome air. 
Bat where these causes of disease exists we 
shall generally find a constant generation of 
them from some source at no great dis- 
tance.

spectmg the distance to which contagious the Grotto 
dSavia are capable of being conveyed, but f^^^ ^ 
the specific gravity of the different kinds 
ZDUst vary these phenomena. In the grotto 
4d Cani, in Italy, for instance, the distance 
to which its particular air spreads is very 
small, as instant death follows respiration at 
the bottom, while, at the top, this opera- 
tion can be performed freely and without 
hyury. 

I have just stated, that in different coun- 
tries, and qven in different parts of the same 
country, spots greatly conducive to health, 
as well as to disease, are to be found ; and 
I do not hesitate to assert, that if greater at- 
tention had been paid to this fact in the 
establishment of colonies, many millions of 
the human race, who have fallen victims to 
premature death, might have lived.

Vera Cru2, its sea*port^ is renKirkable £br 
bad air. 

I have p6inted out the above example as 
a corious £ict^ becaise in general situations 
near the sea are, compared with other parts 
of the same country, the most healthy^ 
This may be given as one instance of thb 
short distance to which c^ertain kinds of 
contagious miasmata may be capable of 
reaching. Hence, it is absolutely necesss- 
ry, that, under such circumstances^ they 
should be carried from place to place, by 
being attached to the bodies of men, &a 
who come within the sphere (^ their action.

Diiferenl 
effects of 
Situation 

gardtop; 



But with respect to the temperature o^ 
countries from their situation, I may observe, 
that ail those which he southward of any 
sea are warmer than those which have the 
sea to the southward of them, at least in our 
hemisphere. 

All those countries lying to the windward 
of high mountains, or extensive forests, are! 
also warmer than those lying to the leeward, 
in the same latitude. 

We find, that the health of countries 
greatly depends, though perhaps in some 
more than others, on the particular soil of 
ilar»oil. wi^jch the country is composed, and this 
must greatly depend on the nature of its 
constituent parts, as well as on those other 
circumstances which regulate, in a great 
measure, the temperature of different coun- 
tries. Thus we find, that stones and sand 
have less capacity for heat than the other 
kinds of earth, which are always somewhat 
moist ; they heat or cool, therefore, more 
rapidly, and to a greater degree. Hence 
the violent heat of Arabia and Africa, and 
the intense cold of Terra del Fuego. But 
although moderately dry, sandy soil is, in 
general, pretty healthy, much of this must 
depend on the particular nature or size of 
the particles of the sand of which it is com- 
posed. Thus at Pensacola, Whydah, 



OS 



the island of Bonavista, is a small, loose, 
sand, which is found to be injurious to 
health. 

The pestiferous vapour *also^ arising dur- 
ing the summer months, and in the heat of 
the day, from such sandy deserts, in South 
America, in Asia, and in Africa, can only be 
characterised by its effects. This blasts 
which is called the Samiel wind, proves, in 
these hot sandy deserts, instantly fatal, both 
to man to beast ; but when it passes over 
aisbil covered with grass and vegetables, its 
effects are mitigated. 

: Thus, while the particular nature of the S^ 
soil, or rather those emanations from the situation 

•% % m n ' n * withrcgarci 

aoil, greatly afreet, from the nature of its to moun- 
situation, the health of individuals, we may p^^ns^/ 
remark, that health 'or disease may depend 
<>a- other circumstances besides these. Such 
are elevated and mountainous places, which 
are even more healthy than dry and sandy 
bnes; and that, independent of the power 
which mountains have in gathering and re« 
taining clouds about them, in consequence 
of which, the country in the neighbourhood 
of high mountains is always most. subject to 
fi^quent rains. 

It has long bden an established fact, that 
a far greater proportion of rain falls in rnoun* 
tainous countrjies than in plains. Among 



06 



tbe Andes^ it is said to raid dlmMt perpi^ 
tually^ while in Egypt it dcarcdy ever rants 
at all. It has been in general observed^ tfami 
aUbough ratns faU daring tfaecohtmusnce of

wind blows from the »ath« 

So remarkably different, in various re* 
spects, are flat Jtnd mountainous <;odntri^ 
that tbe inhabitants of each may b6 con^ 
dered as living in different climates* 

Even Hippocratea observes, ihat tfHmtk^ 
taineers are active in their bodies^ with tbfti^ 
joints well fitted to each other, their dciiif 
hairy, and their m'mds patieift of tabouf and 
watching; their tempers passionate, obsB^

Thus^ the Scots and the Welch long resist* 
ed the arms of the Romans and the Saxons. 

Fertile countries^ upon the same princi^^ 
pie, a{e also observed to product people less 
courageous than those found in barren ones; 

Buffi>n also observes^ that there are gene- 
rally more old men in high than in low 
Countries ; and that the mountains of Scot- 
landi of WaleSj of Auvergne^ of Switzer- 
land, have furnished more examples of ex- 
treme old age than the plains of Holland, 
Flanders, Germany, or Poland When hills, 
however, are found to be very high as the 
Glaciers and the Alps, there are much feweir 
instances of longevity than in more modern 
ately elevated grounds. In Dr Price*s work 
on reversionary payments, we find the follow- 
ing calculation $ that in hilly districts, half of 
the number born live to the age of 47 ; in 
marshy districts to the age only of 45. In 
the fbrmer, one in 2b live to the age of 80^ in 
the latter, one only in S2 reach that period 
of life. 

One reason \ilrhy mountainous countries, 
particularly in cold northern ^cfimates, are 
less subject to disease than warm and flat 
ones,- is, * in some measure^ that the high 
winds prevent the accumulation of those pu-

even under the equator, are coveFcd with 
snow, and, by the severity of the cold, are 
rendered uninhabitable to man or beast. 

Still, however, we find, that, indepen- 
dently of these exceptions, high grounds ex- 
posed to the breezes are, throughout the 
world, the most healthy. 

.In the neighbourhood of Mobile, Pensa- 
cola, and other places in the hot southern, 
and less healthy parts of West Florida, 
there are several elevated situations, expos- 
ed to the winds, and dry, which would afford 
.a safe and certain retreat from the diseases 
which there prevail in the months of July, 
August, and September. 

The country of Brazil is, by the Portu- 
guese, esteemed a paradise, chiefly on ac- 
count of the purity of its air. When the 
sun is there vertical, the air is refreshed and 
cooled by the sea breezes ; and its inland 
parts are fanned by still cooler breezes from 
the Andes 
;a Like this country, we shall find, that Ja- 
maica has one continued ridge of mountaiDs 
running through it, from east to west, be- 
' sides some smaller hills. On the sides of 
ithese mountains, the air is temperate and 
cool, while the vallies are scorched with ex- 
cessive heat, or inundated by violent rains. 
Part of this mountainous ridge is at no great 



kh 



dfiBtance from Spanish Tcmn> Kingston^ an4 
Port Royal^ the principal sea* port 

We do oot^ however^ recommend a re- 
treat to the barren^ eold^ and bleak snmmitu 
of the Bine Mountmns^ where the sodden 
transition from the scorching ^eats in the 
vdlies or woods^ to so intense a degree of 
eddy must be injmioas to the constitution ; 
im to SHcfa an height as where the vapoors 
«re condensed into miMs or clouds. 

In no part of these high grounds do they 
Mfier from want of rain^ although along the 
aea^eoest the country is often parched. 
-These different states must consequently 
fMfoduce very different effects on the h^th 
of the individuals near them. Some of the 
fofts are very healthy^ as Fort Augusta, or 
9toney*hill ; indeed, tfiese two last quarters 
would not be reckoned unhealtiiy in any 
part of the world. Similar situations are to 
be- found in all parts of this country, and in 
most of the other West India islands. The 
situations are of two kinds, dry sand-^benks, 
stntOtttided either wholly, or in part^ by the 
sea, and out of the reach of noxious winds 
blowing from swamps and marshes ; and de- 
bated situations on the mountions. InpliBi-

eiv^, is peculiarly endemial in low, woody, 
and marshy places, where persons of all ages, 
and of both dexes, are subject to its frequent 
attadcs, and from which even infants at the 
breast ^n not exempted. It is far from be-

We know, that in some of the Idwea^ 
moistest, and closest, parts^ of IiOi%doa^ 
where effluvia, perhaps not greatly ibfi^ent 
from that emitted by marshes^ are to b^ 
found among the poorer people, 8potte4 i#j 
vers and dysenteries are often to be Qiet 
with, and these are seldom beard of among 
people of better rank, living in more airy si^ 
tuations. Hence the autumnal remilteni 
has, by some, been called the Westminater 
fever; and many, by their attendance on the 
houses of Parliament, or the courts of law^ 
in the beginning of the* sessions, when tbf 
houses were more damp than usiial^ baft 
contracted malignant diseases. * 

We find medical writers observe tbak tht 
most unhealthy spots c^ any eottntiy art 
those where low damp exhaling surfaces am^ 
to be found. Sir John Pringle, in bia ao» 
count of the campaign in Scotlandj^ compti^ 
ing Fort Augustus to Fort William, obt* 
serves, that the former of these bas always 
been a healthy garrrison; but that lh# 
latter, which lies toward the wtst^m

that th^e is npt Qt)Iy a greater fall of rain, 
but a slow^ evaporation in that part than in 
any other of the country* 
. . Independently^ however, of Fort Augus- 
tnft being in general more healthy tlmn Fort 
WtlUanii it would still appear that, during 
thcT autumn, it is not so ; for, in the middle

pi Dutch Brabant, where the people are 
more or less subject to intermittent^ in pro- 
portion to the distance of the water from the 



t08 



iut&ce ; so that by looking into their welld|, 
it is easy to ascertain the healthiness of se* 
veral of their villages. 

In the East It is a phenomenon in nature, not easily 
accounted for, but, at the same time, an ihk 
contestible fact, that in stagnating poola of 
water at Bombay, which hiave no communi- 
cation with an V river, or with the sea, and 
which are produced solely by the rains, Itv^ 
ing fish are generated, of which many per- 
sons have eaten, and which, upon the drying 
up of these pools die, are corruptedj and 
produce disease. 

It is strange, that in India, as in evefy 
T)ther country, so little attention has been 
paid to the selecting of the most healthy 
spots for the residence of the inhabitaitlti^ 
and that in general when a favourable spot 
was choyn, it was seemingly more anr act 
of chance than design. 

In Ainca. In Africa, also, we find^ that Europeflqs 
have unfortunately fixed some of their prm- 
cipal settlements either on low, inland^ on- 
perflated, and uncultivated sjpots, the £M 
banks of rivers, or near their swampy and 
oozy mouths, or upon salt-mandies, formed 
by the overflowing of the ocean, where -m 
many places the putrid fish, scattered on the 
shore by the negroes, enjiit such noisome 



109 



ei&avia, as proves very injurious to the con^ 
stitation. 

The English castle at Whydah, also^ has 
been rendered more unhealthy than the ne- 
gro town in its neighbourhood^ by a small 
circumstance unattended to in constructing 
it. It is built on a spot of ground that the 
aea breezes cannot reach, without passing 
over an inconsiderable brook of water, which 
produces some aquatic plants, always covers 
ed with slime. 

Upon this occasion I cannot help obsery«- 
ing, that there is scarcely a physical cause 
which can be assigned for the production 
of any disease that does not, from some other 
accessary circumstance, admit of some ex* 
ceptions. Thus, not only the woods and 
morasses in Guinea are tolerably healthy in 
the dry season, if we except Old and New 
Calabar, Benin> and such like p|{u:es ; but a 
few instances might be*produced, of towns 
surrounded by matshes and a foggy air^ 
where the inhabitants suffer, even during the 
rainy season, no inconvenience from their 
situation ; of which an example is New Or- 
leans, in Louisiana* There seem to be but 
two causes which can be assigned for these 
phenomena^ either that the inhabitants be- 
come inured to . such effluvia, and conse- 
quently are enabled to resist their bad ef* 



110 



iccts ; or, that there is some particular ^CHK* 
lity of the effluvia^ by which they are unabk^ 
to communicate disease. 

From various other situations, although 
disease be not actually induced^ yet other eC^ 
fects nearly as bad arise. On the variety of 
dimate caused by such circumstances, th^ 
strength and activity of the inhabitants ^eat^ 
ly depend. This truth is well known to 
those who trade for slaves on the African 
coast. The negroes they ' purchase are dull 
or stupid, lively or ingenious^ sickly or ro- 
bust, long or short livedo according to the 
situation whence they are brought* . , <" 

The state to which the air is sometimes 
reduced in Africa by jputre&ction, is scarce^ 
ly, I believe, to be credited by an European 
who has not visited that coast. Many parts 
of that country are altogether unculUvatec^ 
overflowed^ with water, surrounded by 
thick impenetrable woods, and over-run with 
slime. The air is vitiated, noisome and 
thick^ ini9omuch that lighted torches or can- 
dles burn dimly, and seem ready .to beeji- 
tinguished ; even the human voice loses its 
natural tone* The smell of the ground and 
of the houses is raw and offensive ; but the 
vapoor arising from the putrid water in the 
ditches is much wOTse. AU this, however^

the air, and 'extinguish even the candles by 
their -flight; but the greatest plague are 
the tnusquitbea and tand-flies, whose inces- 
sant buzz, and painful stings, are insup- 
portable. 
In the West Indies, too, it is observed, intheWest 

T J* 

thatp during the rains, the periodical sick- 
ness which attends them is much more vio- 
lent in the hot, marshy, woody, or unculti- 
vated places, than upon the adjacent islands. 
It is in such places, and at such times, that 
troops have suffered so much in these islands. 
][ndeed,^ it m^y be laid down as a maxim, 
Ihat under these circumstances, no troops 
can stand encampment even for a few weeks 
at a time. It is certainly owing to this that 
80 many thousands of our excellent troops 
Jiave, of late years, fallen on this destructive 
coast ; while the inhabitants, comparatively 
speaking, scarcely at all suffered from the 



112 



fiame cause. The sudden transition ffXMn 
breathing the pure sea air on their voyage^ 
to their encampment^ perhaps during the 
unhtelthy season, exposed them to every 
chance of infection^ which rarely &iled of 
being most destructive to them. Aad this 
may be an additional reason why the iaha-' 
bitants suffered less than our troops.

both within and without their habitations; 

The- disease raged with the ihost unre- 
liiitting violence for a considerable time^ till 
it was happily dbserved, that the sick who 
were moved into the hospitals which stooct 
near the sea^ recovered much more quickly 
than in odier places ; and that few of theni 
died. 

:* Upon this being represented to the King^ 
fhorfey was ordered out of the treasury for

inconsiderable in proportion to those lost in 
other places. In these well ventilated hosi 
pitals^ open to the iiea air, the progress of 
the contagion was entit^ely stopjied, and none 
cf the nurses or attendants on the sick v^erd 
infected with the distemper^

banks of ri vers^ or the foul shores of the aeoy 
the vapours exhaling from putrid stagnant 
water^ either fresh or salt^ from lai|^ 
swamps^ from corrupted vegetables^ and 
other impurities^ almost uniformly produce 
mortal diseases. 

We find also that some harbours, in the Bay 
of Mexico, §or instance, and thoset generally 
the most secure, prove &tal to Europeans 
irom another cause. Thus, in Fort. Maho^ 
near the island of Rathuan, ships Jie in a 
bason of water, so environed with very high 
mountains that the wind can have no access 
to them; aiid in this respect they sufier 
more than even at English Harbour, Anti^ 
gua. The stagnating air thence becomes no 
putrid and unwholesome, that the meOft 
after being there a fqw days, are ^uddjsoiy 
seized with violent vomitings, headachs, d^

OF ARTIFICIAL CAUSES. 



Sect. 1.-^0/ ConstructtQu of Houses^ 

Among all the artificial causes of disease, import- 
none, perhaps, contribute a greater share, if J^^tl^n to" 
not to their production, at least to their the Con- 

* ' ■ 8triictioiio£ 

continuance, than the construction of Houses, 
houses. Although it is to negligence, in 
almost every instance, that we are to attri* 
bute this, we so often see houses, both with 
r^gjard to their situatioa and construction^

placed SO as to have sudi eminently destrue^ 
live efiects upon health, 4hat we are almost 
fed to believe it had been done by desigo. 
Having committed this faulty we next at- 
tempt to juitiiy iu But nothing can be 
mom unreasonable than the pretences nsed 
among tis to excuse this inattention and fi^«- 
ligence; and the fdiowing authority or 
this subject may be adduced. Dr M^ad> 
in his discourse concerning pestilential con- 
tagion^ says^ nothing approaches so near to 
the first original of contagion as air pent up^ 
loaded with damps, and corrupted with the 
.filthiness that proceeds from animal bodies. 
Our common prisons afibrd us an instance 
•of this, in which very few escape what they 
call the jail fever, which is always attended 
with a degree of malignity in proportion to 
the closeness and stench of the place. And 
it certainly would very well become the wis* 
dom of the government, as well with regard 
to the health of the town, as in compassion 
to the prisoners, to take care that all housea 
ofx:onfinement should be kept as airy tod 
clean as is consistent with the use to which 
they are designed.

via. How then is it possible for heaitb to 
be enjoyed in them, when we find it assert- 
ed by writers upon this subject^ that a gal- 
lon (^ fresh air is consumed every minute 
by a man in health ; or, in other words, 
that a hogshead will only last him an hour« 
A aick person requires a larger supply, be-^ 
cause he more quickly contaminates it ; and,, 
as a cleai: proof of the very bad effect of 
such contaminated ^r, animals expire soon- 
er in it that even in a vacuum* We know, 
however, that several of the inferior animals 
will live in a given quantity of air until its 
oxygen gas is completely consumed ; but 
those of the superior orders, do not bear this. 
total privatipn. ' 

Many degreea of contamination may take 
place in the air before it becomes quite unfijt 
for supporting animal life ; but when air ar- 
rives at that pitch of contamination at which 
it extinguishes a lighted candle, th^n it is 
completely unfit for supporting life. 

This state of the air is^ perhaps, of all State to 
causes, most commonly produced by respi- Educed in 
iration, and certainly in this way in a far confined 

*' . Situations, 

greater degree than by the perspiration of 
the body. 

This fluid ia then, as we have stated, great- 
ly contaminated by respiration ; but it may 
aUo be injured by other causes, for we find,^ 

h4 



120 



that air corrupted by putrefaction is, of all 
causes of sickness, the most fatal and least 
understood. 

The air in hospitals, crowded barracks, 
close transport ships, and, in a word, in 
every place where it is so pent up, not 
only loses a part of its vital principle by fre- 
quent respiration, but is also corrupted by 
the perspirable matter of the body« Hence 
it is, that in proportion to the nastiness of 
such places, to the number of dysenteries, 
and of foul sores, but, above all^ of morti* 
fications, malignant fever is both frequent 
and mortal* 
Compara- We may compare this state with that 
m^ result- ^^ '^^ country, where the bad effects of the 
ing from construction of houses is in part obviated by 

its state • • 

in Open a free circulation of air in them. The great 
SacdShu. difference is very visible in almost every in- 
tions. stance, when, for want of employment, the 
peasantry are driven into towns, wher^ 
from confinement in close and crowded ma- 
nufactories, .they soon exchange their ruddy 
complexion for a pale and meagre visage. 
This loss of health, also, is too commonly and 
fatally attended also with loss of morals, and, 
from the contaminating effects of vicioiis 
examfJe, many become initiated in the low 
^nd wicked artij of chicanery and frai^d. 



121 



Wkh respect to the comparative mbrtali^ 
ty of these difll^rent situations, it is observ* 
ed^ that although mortality from epidemics 
be more constant and regular in cities 
than in pure open air, yet that in this last, 
when they do happen, they are more viru« 
lent than in the other. It must certainly, 
however, be allowed, that the comparative 
advantages are to be found upon the whole 
in the country. 

With respect to the effects of the purity 
of the air in these difierent parts upon chil- 
dren, we find a calculation in the Bi^ 
shop of Worcester's sermon, preached for 
the benefit of the Foundling Hospital in 
1756, shewing, that many more diildren die 
in proportion, which are nursed in populous 
towns, or brought up by the hand, than if 
they were nursed in the country, and hou-^ 
rished at the breast. 

That the poor of every populous town are 
peculiarly liable to the attacks of contagious 
distempers, is a fact of which every one, 
who has at all attended to the subject, must 
be fully satisfied ; but those who have wit- 
nessed the situation of the lower classes in 
the country only, and have not been indu- 
ced to explore the recesses of poverty and 
disease iii cities, cannot be aware; how many 
Qf these dwellings, on all sides closely sur* 



122 



rounded by buildings, and in their whole 
appearance indicating filth and wretched- 
ness, are in situations favourable to tha^ 
spreading of infection* 

Taking a, general view, we shall find, tbat^ 
the number of deaths must greatly depend 
not on one, but on various circumstancea, 
combined. 

The inhabitants of city, town, and coun- 
try, from birth to the extreme of existence^, 
are computed to die in the following annual 
proportion to the living : In London, 1 of 
21 ; Dublio, 1 of 2^; Edinburgh, 1 of 21 ;. 
Vienna, 1 of 20 ;. Amsterdam, 1 of 22 } 
JBerlin, 1 of 2fi» This is neiurly Dr Price's 
calculation ; but Halley, aod othei;s, com- 
pute only from 1 of 22, to 1 of 29 to die an^ 
nually in cities. In smaller cities or towns^ 
the general average of deaths is fipm 1 o£ 
24, to 1 of 26 ; but in several pirovinceS)^ 
and healthy ccHUitry villages,, ffom I of 32,. 
to 1 of 33, up even to 1 of 45, 5€H and.evea 
60, is the annual difference. From k of 4ft 
to 1 of 50 was found to be the average in up* 
wards of a thousand country parishes on the 
continent. Within the above short intervala 
of time, there wiU therefDre have died in the 
re^)ective cities and country places- enume«t

Houses of by the unsuspecting inhabitants are literally 
a nursery for the propagation of difiereot 
diseases. They are small^ old» and cominoD* 
ly* very low in the ceilings. The individual 
apartments are very small, and if they kme 
windmvsy they are likewise small. This ar^ 
rangement was, I believe, principally made 
from the vitiated taste of the times is whidi 
they were built, while at the same time th^ 
contributed to keep the miserable inbabi* 
tants warmer than if more room and larger 
windows had been preserved. .The walli, 
however, of most of these habitation^ are 
damp, the floor is commonly on the under 
storey of clay, or, if otherwise^ the boards 
are rotten and moulded. Thus, a large fii^ 
mily is often packed together within their 
own stinking clothes, foul linen, &c. suf- 
ficiently rank to sufibcate either the inha- 
bitants or any person who may approach 
too near them. ' 

The rbo& of houses in many parts of 
this country are entirely formed of straw of 
different kinds, which, from the rain slowly 
insinuMing itself into their substance, gira- 
dualfy reduces them to one mass of putre- 
faction; and although disease. is not thus

There is an uniformity in the effects of 
ill constructed houses, implying nastiness, 
want of venlilatiori, &c. which may easily 
be traced. 

The habitations of the poor, where fever 
prevails^ are low, dirty, and ill ajred, being

One poor family in these {4iEK:ea telAou 
occupies ' more than one room. Their 
apartments in' general have seldom ievta one 
window each> the isash of which, if: it dbet 
exist, is either entirely' fixed, or is so oon-' 
structed, as to open only at a small part. 
A wretched bedrstead, a chair, and a ^stool, 
are not unfrequently the whole stock of 
furniture. The bed^dlothes are, in genera),' 
scanty, tattered, and dirty ; and it is^ agrafe 
thing indeed that they have any change of 
bed-linen. Amongst the most indigent, the 
bedrclothes are never scoured, or the sheets 
washed, and an equal inattention to cleabfi-* 
ness is observed in their dress; their rooms 
are seldom, if ever, white- washed ; the floors 
are dirty, and the stairs and passages to 
them fikhy, dark, and unventilated ; their 
windows being for the most part block- 
ed up. 

In such wretched habitations a fever is 
frequently generated; but whether it be 
generated or introduced into a family^ the 
contagion spreads over the whole house.

Independently .<:i£ the • danipoess of uaaider- 
. ground houses, there is another e¥il with 
which they are troubled,, that is, their being 
infested with vermia of various kind,.the pire- 
sence of which always proves troublesonve, 
if not dangerous. 

These habitations ought,, by genera) cbn- 
aenty to be abandoned^ or rather a law

: From the closeness of the room, the 
air becomes completely vitiated by the nox» 
ious effluvia, which are deposited on the

hodse. 

In : short, evqry author who has oecasiidti 
to mfentioQ this subject^ reprobates this cus- 
tom of living or sleeping in these damp un- 
derground apartments, as being nurseries of 
pesdlent and infectious vapours ; yet no-

M. Pellegrini, professor of anatomy at 
Venice, ^ who has published a translation of 
.the Avis.aux Peuples^ with additional re- 
marks, has made an observation^ which 
shows the danger of damp rooms ; it is of a 
woman in the prime of life, and in very good 
health, who was always seized with an apo- 
plexy whenever she remained in a damp 
place, which also went off when she removed 



m 



to dry air ; and which never recurred unless 
she returned tb the damp apartment. 

It may be urged in opposition to my opi- 
nion/ that small miserable hovels^ not of 
themselves well calculated for profiting by 
free ventilation, often contain very healthy, 
and oflen very vigorous inhabitants. Such 
is said to be the case in Ireland, where the 
habitations of the peasantry and lower 
orders of the people, are very small and very 
miserable. But this may be accounted for. 
These houses although smalli seven feet 
high in general, are seldom above five or six 
hi connection, consequently they cannot be 
compared to houses in large cities, where 
sometimes 20 or 30 families live under one 
roof, and it is consequently impossible to 
ventilate them so well as the huts in Ire- 
land. 

Among people of higher rank in socie*^ 
ty, who sleep in airy chambers, where 
strict attention is paid to cleanliness, the 
danger of infection, even when it exists in 
the immediate neighbourhood^ is not nearly 
so gfeat as among the above-mentioned or-» 
ders of society. Still, however, these dis- 
eases may be carried into their houses in 
various ways, and, among others, the giv- 
ing out of infants to nurse, introduces it 
among them* 



130 



The situation of life of these nurses in ge^ 
neral, and the very small sum of money allow- 
ed them for nursing children^ compel them^ 
from economical principles^ to live ip habi* 
tations such as I have described. The nurse 
herself suffers no bad consequences, having 
been accustomed to vegetate in such hoveia^ 
but the infant^ which has probaUy been 
taken from a well aired habitation into 
these vaults^ lighted only from the door, or 
from the fire in the apartment, is often sriz- 
ed with a variety of apparently unaccounta- 
ble disorders, which terminate in death. 
cdsiifr^ In these houses, in ships, particularly 
small ones if crowded, or in apartments 
however constructed. So that free circulation 
of air cannot be permitted in them, we find 
complaints of various kinds, and of every 
degree of virulence. In the same fleet, we 
often find the crews of small crowded ves- 
sels, not only in a diseased state themselves, 
but imparting similar diseases to those of 
larger and better aired ships, which, but for 
being placed near them, would have remain- 
ed in all probability in good health. This, 
in some respects, resembles the prepagaticMi 
of contagious diseases in towns or cities, 
where the most cleanly and formerly healthy 
parts suffer from the carelessness oi thfi 



131 



loi^fir orcJerS:, and the most dirty parts of ko* 

cii^tj. 

Jn vessels, where qiep are crowded toge-*

tq this happened under the observation qf Sir 
Jojin Pripgle, in bis voyage from Holland to 
Britfiin, with the forces in 1749-6, qf which 
n^any of tbe men died. 

In prisons, too, the most common classes Of ill cpn^ 
of disease principally arise from similar Pri^o^si 
c^u^^ such as want of pure air, wabt of ex- 
ercise, and proper diet, dppre9sipn of spirits^ 
ej^posure to cold and uncleanliness. One 
or more of these, with the confinement in 
the dark damp dungeons' of prisons, have 
l)|ien the chief causes of jail fever* III 
i^tering into these places, the sallow mea- 
gre icqpntenances to^ be seen every where 
i^it):]^ili them, declare, without words, that 
ihfiy are very miserable. Many who go in* 
to tkn^m in good healthy are, in a few mohths> 
clanged to eniaciated and dejected objects. 
Thas sickness is introduced, and the air in- 
jured by respiration, is seldom, if ever, waft^ 
ed from their sickly bodies, which, combined 
vitb whatever else in prisons^ or in houses 

12 



132 



constructed on similar princqdes^is offensive^ 
renders the effluvia poisonous to the highest 
degree. And it is a fact^ that if confine- 
ment in such an atmosphere^ &c. be perse- 
vered in^ and the prisoners or inhabitants 
survive any length of time^ they are not only 
rendered incapable of working, but many of 
them have their toes rotted from their feet. 
Brocklesby gives us an account of the pro- 
gress of one of these complaints which oc- 
cured in the Savoy prison, in 1762, and which 
was similar in its terminations to what I have 
now mentioned. 

" These men," says he, *' had been con- 
fined in a close unwholesome apartment of 
the Savoy, with many newly enlisted men, 
who were, without offence, in great num- 
bers, and without requisite care in the non- 
commissioned ofHcers, often so preposter- 
ously there huddled together, that numbers 
of them were at various times seized with 
the jail fever; and w^ had not a few of 
them brought into Pimlico hospital in this 
fever, after mortification had deprived them 
of a foot, a part of their toes, or some other 
extremity of their bodies ; and this was ab- 
solutely owing to the nastiness and unwhole^ 
someness of the foul air, which they were 
often doomed to live in.** 

The prisons in London^ like those m rafl- 



133 



ny other places, are absurdly placed in the 
very middle of the city, or at least in parts' 
of it where fresh air is not the most plenti- 
fiil ingredient. But what is still more un- 
pardonable, many of them that would admit 
ventilation, have not so much attention paid' 
to them in that respect as even their local 
situation would admit of, and consequently 
diseases from confinement are constantly 
propagated among them. 

No encomium, however great, can do 
sufficient justice to the philanthropic dispo- 
sition and indefatigable exertions, of Mr 
Howard, who, perhaps, as a single individu*^ 
al, did more for the relief of the suffering 
poor than any one who either went before 
or who has followed him. It was his opi- 
niop, and I believe his opinion may still hold 
good, th^t Qur prisons were, in point of 
construction and internal management, 
much inferior to similar places in almost 
eveiy other part of Europe which he visited. 
Surely this could not origiqate from want o£ 
airy situations, or judgment in the construe- 
tipn pf houses in general. It must therefore 
have , originated frpm^ artificial, an4 conse- 
quently ren^ovable causes^ provifled the in-:

still remain unnoticed^ it would be difficult 
to determine iviiether tiie iniprikming or 
the imprisoned are the most guilty. - 

The perceptible difference between Oui*s 
and the continental prisons, aB welt ^ thSit:. 
comparative eflects^ cannot be mech better 
es:emplified than in the fbllowing quotation 
from Howard. 

" I sat/' says he, *^ an afternoon with Dr 
Puntze of Bremen^ who told me ht^ WM ik. 
London in 1753 and 34, with an inquisitive 
friend, a German. They went into Nteww 
gate to observe the efiects of thfe vehtihtot'^ 
and were struck with an offensive fifjMH id 
one of the rooms. Next day they <tere 
both indisposed. The Doctor^ dompliuHt 
turned out a kind €)f jaundice. After h few 
days confinement he visited his friend^ ' mA 
Ibnnd him excessively lovir ; aiid in ii alhdrt 
ti^rtl^ he died wi^ ^very sytnptom of jaS* 
fever.** 

i 

The above were, I shodd imagine, avdi- 
ciertt proofs of the bad eSketa of ftH bonwB 
constructed upon similar princi^bes. We 
have likewise tke authority of Sit* ^dllh

infected with jail fever, by some deserters 
brought from prisons in England* 

Thus^ from its capability, like most other 
febrile complaints^ of being carried to such 
a distance from its source^ and from the 
many melancholy examples of tlie devastai- 
tions recorded both in the writings of an- 
cient and modern authors^ which it has^ and 
is daily making, no exertion ought to be 
withheld that can suppress it, Mr Howard 
thinks^ that from this cause alone many 
more were destroyed than were put to death 
by all the public executions in the king- 
dom. 

We boast of the independence, the fiber- conciud- 
ty, and the freedom, which we are so lustly *"«. ^^^^^' 
proud of in Great Britain, while we permit 
a slavery to exist in almost every part of our 
island, more galling in its nature, and more 
destructive in its consequences, than the 
chains of the most despotic tyrant We 
constantly allow thousands to exist in the 
most loathsome cells, slowly but surely de- 
stroyed by those withering diseases, which 
are propagated with tbemseWes^ and suffer-^ 
ed to exist, while matters perhaps no way 
to be compared to them in importance, are 
occupying the public mini.

view of the mortality of the human species, 
which, taking the metropolis of our island 
as an example, proves that in such cities, 
evidently from the particular state of the 
buildings, and consequently the vitiated 
state of the air, more deaths occur than 
christenings.

Sect. II.— Qf Occupations, 

jniport- There are innumemble dccupations, the; 

Scpamiw^ prosecution of which must be less or more. 
bf the en- productive of disease ; and the general im- 



137 



portance of this enquiry must be at once apr 
parent* 
The occupations of the learned piresent Bad effecu 

1 r !• •mi resulting 

two pnncipal causes of disease, viz. The per- from the 
petual labours of the mind, and the constant tkmToYthe 
inaction of the body. ^^ Study (says M. learned. 
Rousseau) makes men tender, weakens their 
constitutions, and when once the body has 
lost its powers, those of the soul ' are not 
easily preserved. .Application wears out the 
machine, exhausts the spirits, destroys the 
strength, enervates the mind, makes us pu« 
sillanimous, unable either to bear fatigue, or 
to keep our passions under.'* 

. This picture must be familiar to every one, 
for there aire few who have not either seen 
or felt the truth of the observations it con- 
tains. The confined air which men breathe, 
•who live almost constantlyamong their books^ 
is a cause of these evils, not sufficiently at- 
tended to. A pure, open, country air is very 
refreshing, facilitates respiration and the 
functions dependent upon it, confers strength 
and enlivens the whde machine. But in- 
tBtead of enjoying the benefit of it, literary 
men generally live in an atmosphere, which 
:heing seldom renewed^ is dense, full of va- 
.pQui:^ and inelastic; by this m^ns, they 
^re heated rather than refreshed, become 
)ieavy instead of being animated, and are 



138 



more relaxed than strengthened ; 
this air^ insteadof promoting, obstructs per-- 
spiration, and thereby increases the bad e& 
fects proceeding from the other causes by 
which the learned are surrounded. Not to 
renew the air of one's room^ is absolutely to 
live in the impurities of the preceding day« 
This evil certainly must be increased, if the 
chamber be placed where fresh air is not to 
be obtained. In general, however, this is 
not the case, and those evils are perpetuated 
which, by a little attention, might be avoid- 
ed. 

An inexcusable error, too, often practised 
by the learned, is the destructive habit of 
studying ail or a greater part of the night; 
From such habits themselves, remonstrances 
stronger than any I can urge, must have 
arisen to every one who practises such ir- 
regularities. Independent, indeed, of any 
other consideration, the oily vapours arisiDg 
from the candles we use for light, alone^ 
contribute greatly to increase the danger of 
studying at night, by corrupting the air^ and 
making it equally pernicious to the eyes, the 
general superficies of the body and the lungv. 
If we burn wax, the danger indeed is not 
so great ; but it still subsists to a certate 4c^ 
grce.

Youttg men beginning the study of any 
of the learned professions) particularly if they 
be sWayfed by that noble enthusiasm, with- 
out which excellence cannot be attained^ 
often, by their eagerness to excel in that 
occupation to which they propose to devote 
thmi* rttention> induce diseases, the results 
of which they too seldom regardj till theit 
rettto^M becomes a difficulty, perhaps an 
iM^os^bility. The warnings, arguments, 
6titreiaties and chidings of those whose ex- 
pfetieitee in life hath taught them better, are 
often resorted to in vain ; they find out a 
thomi^nd way s of deceiving both their friends 
ditxd themselv^ ; one depends upon the 
^tfength of his constitution ; anotheir pleads 
the force of custom as capable of fitting a 
person for any task ; a third flatters himself, 
thiat his shall still escape, because he has 
never yet suffered^ In short, there is no 
end to the apologies which enthusiasm and 
ii!igemiity tmy suggest* This ilangerous 
mode tif -probe^ding has, within th^ circle of 
Thy 6wn aeq^aintftnce, 4e8troyed the lives of

rentSj who fondly indulged the expectation

140 



which, from such causes, have peyer been 
realized, are innumerable. 

Even when these practices are scarcely 
carried to excess, every man who has, for 
some days, been confined to his study, must 
feel his head heavy, his eyes inflamed, his 
lips and mouth dry ; he complains of uneasi- 
ness about his breast, slight tension ^t the 
pit of his stomach, is rather diposed to mel- 
ancholy, his sleep is less refreshing, and his 
limbs are weighty and benumbed. Jf he 
still persist, all the symptoms increase, and 
lay the foundation of many diseases. 

A walk, for two d|r three hours in the 
country, dispels these symptoms entirely, 
and brings back serenity, freshpess and 
strength. 
Bad effects Other Occupations in life, especially those 
frOTiroc. where much heat is necessary, have been 
capations particularly remarked as predisposing causes 
heat is em. of disease. In countries where the plague 
^°y^^ exists, bakers, for instance, during its in- 
fluence, have been observed to suffer in a 
remarkable proportion. Mercurialis observes, 
that smiths, and all those who wcM-ked a^ 
the fire, suffered most severely in the Plague 
at Venice in his time.

Ui 



not likely to prove hurtful to any great 
number of the human race; yet there 
are particular employments, and even si- 
tuations^ which are peculiarly obnoxious 
to it. Such are miners, and others who, 
though not actually employed in working 
mines, reside in their neighbourhood. 

That lead is taken into the body in all its 
various forms, i& an established fact. It is 
immaterial whether^ in the form of vapor, 
as among smelters, in a metallic state, as 
among plumbers and glaziers, in a calx ad 
among painters and white-lead manufac- 
turers, or in a saline state as in wine or ci- 
der. New rum distilled in proper vessels 
appears also to be a vehicle, in which it rea- 
dily finds admission into the system. 

Fallopius observes, that such as work in' 
quick-silver mines, seldom live above three 
years ; that they are generally affected with 
palsies, vertigos and other diseases of the 
nerves ; that those who work in lead mines, 
are also liable to paralytic disorders, and to 
gripes, colics and other complaints of the 
bowels. 

Partial paralytic disorders are even very 
common among those printers who are much 
in the habit of handling the types ; particu- 
larly compositors. These diseases often 
aifiect them only in a very slight degree^ and 



142 



b^ refraining from wc^-k for a few'dftys or 
weeks^ they entirely disappear. At other 
tme^i one or both hands are rendered confix 
pletely powerless ; and, independently q£ the 
very greatest attention that can be paid to 
them^ remain often in that state for many 
months. A case of this kind lately came 
under my care, which, independently of 
every variety pf treatment that I could adc^tf 
was not completely cured for several months. 
From the same cause also, a shrinking of 
the hand and fingers has been produced, and 
has even remained so during the peraon*d 
life. 
From Cutting down of woods, clearing tlicJ 

Sec. ' ground from trees and shrubs, or draining 
marshes, are employments very fatal in hot 
climates, especially during the rainy seaaopj 
and particularly to Eurc^ans. 

Night employments of every sort are also 

highly dangerous, particularly when the air 

is foggy ; and even in our own temperate 

climate, the drainers of marshes have fre^ 

quently been known to die (^diseases whicb 

were evidently communicated to them while 

emfJoyed in their trade. 

Those said 1"^^ yards have been pointed out by ao- 

JO^ thors, and their removal recmnmended aa 

u)g. likdy to be of benefit to the neighbouring 

inhabitants. Upon finding such opini&ia 



143 



stated in books, I have conversed with 
perwns who must be well acquainted with 
these matters ; and they have uniformly as- 
sured me, that the working tanners are un« 
commonly healthy, being seldom affected by 
any disease ; and even those in the neigh-^ 
bourhoQc^ of these works have never, so far 
as I have been able to learn, suiSered* ii^ 
their health in consequence of them. If bad 
^Bects have at any time appeared to arise 
from them, it must have been from the pu-^ 
trid bodies of animals from which skins had 
been removed. 

I have thus only adduced a few of th^ ing"obscr- 
occupations which seem to .influence the vatioos. 
lieajth of those employed in them. To enu* 
xnerate, however, all the occupations which 
are well known to have this effect, would 
be a very tedious task ; and, to the majority 
of my readers would certainly be uninterest* 
ing. Even the few occupations which I 
have mentioned, are principally adduced for 
the purpose of directing the attention of 
those who are particularly attached to 
these important inquiries, which, (if justice 
were done to the subject), would constitute 
a work of the highest importance to society. 

I am aware, that individual instances may be 
stated in contradiction even to those which I 
have adduced ; but these cannot overturn a 



U4 



general principle, particularly such a one as 
the present, which is built on the broadest 
basis of experience and observatioii. Too 
much time, and often splendid abilitie^^ are 
thus wasted in words, wheii they may be 
much more usefully employed during the very 
few years of hiiniiin existehce. Our constant 
experience in life, supported by all our own 
feelings, hourly convinces us, that the ties 
by which it is held, are of the most delicate 
and perishable nature. Like us, every ob- 
ject in nature is continually undergoing 
spontaneous changes, the particular tiature 
of which must infallibly contribute either to 
the restoration of health, or to the propaga- 
tion of disease. We cannot even look <m 
these changes and doubt of the attfibtit^S 
of that Deity to whom they oWe their origiti. 

^^ What docs not fade ? the tower that long had • 
stood 
The crush of thunder, and the warring winds^ 
Shook by the slow, but sure destroyer Time, 
Now hangs in doubtful ruin o'er its base. 
And flinty pyramids, and walls of brass. 
Descend : the Babylonian spires are sunk ; 
Achaia, Rome, and Egypt moulder down. 
Time shakes the stable tyranny of thrones. 
And tottering empires crush by their own weight* 
This huge rotundity we tread grows old ; 
And all the worlds that roll around the sun/^

• Sect. llL—^Of Modes of Livings 

It has been observed, I believe, in evei*y Their gp- 
fcountry^ thatj independently of circumstan- flucncc* 
fees, the mode of living peculiar to all, .or to 
individual inhabitants, has a great effect in 
predisposing the body to the attack of those 
disea^s which iliay be prevalent at the 

time. 

Independently of other circumstances^ 
tpo, particular modes of living h^ve a re* 
niarlcable effect on the increase or diminu« 
tion of bodily strength ; and although, in 
many instances, they produce no marked 
3tate of disease, yet they often influence, in 
^ very great degree,* both the state of the 
body, and the passions of the mind. 

However much it may be overlooked, we Effects of 
ghall find, that as luxury advances in any andE«:crt 
country, the health of that part of th6 com- 
munity to which it reaches, declines. I al- 
lowj that great . differences may exist with 
respect to its effects on stronger and wfeak- 
er individuals ; but this does not overturn 
the general principle. It is from np inno^ 
Vation of this kind reaching the habitation 
of the cottager (otherwise unexposed to dis^ 
ease,) that we are to attribute his uninter- 
rupted health for an amazing length of life. 
llis sleep is equally undisturbed by the dor-^ 



146 



roding cares of the af&uent, and by tfie*un-*> 
meaning bustle of the gay and the dissfpat- 
ed. Their excesses neither disturb his awn 
repose^ nor tend to vitiate his healthy pro-* 
geny. 

I may remark, that, although irregularity 
may have for many years no evidently bad 
effect on the health of the individual who 
indulges in it, yet I have scarcely ever, ev«l 
in those of the most robust habits, seen such 
practices persevered in for a number of 
years, that about the age of 40 or 45, the 
most remarkable change for the wcH'se did 
not take place in the health of such persona. 
Indeed, where one survives such changes^ 
perhaps a thousand lose their lives by them, 
or are at least rendered unfit ever after fx 
performing the duties connected with any 
station in life. The streets of every city 
too often exhibit such spectacles, who exist 
only as dismal monuments of their former 
inconsiderate and, to call it no worse, their 
foolish modes of living. 

And even although at first during such 
habits^ 

*^ — ■—» No sicWy qualms bedim their day% 

No morning admonitions shock the bead* 
What woes remain ! Life rolls apace^ 
And that incurable disease old age.

Luiury^ also, as being unfavourable to 
Jbealth, and theteby rendering the body lesg

increase the sensibility of the system. Th^ 
petulence, indeed, of those addicted to such 
indulgence has been observed in every 
age. 

In every part of the world, in short, irre- 
gularity in living seems to affect the bulk of 
mankind nearly in a similar way. Natives^ 
however, of any particular country are les^ 
feabject to suffer from irregularity in living 
than those who from other countries visit 
them. 

Europes^ns, iri warm climates, especially 
Such as live intemperately, are peculiarly 
iabject to fluxes, and to inflammations, ot 
diseases of the liver, which last is most com* 
mon in Tndia, and particularly on the Coro^* 
mandel coast.

If those, too, who are newly arrived in the 
West Indies, drink immodefafely of newly 
distilled rum, they are unavoidably attacked 
by a violent fever ; if they commit any ex- 
cess in eating fruits, they are attacked bjr 
flux ; if they load their stomachs with in- 
digestible food, they are seized by cholera 
morbus, or vomiting, which may, in a few 
hours, carry them off. But it is equally 
certain, that the most abstemious and tem- 
perate persons sometimes die prematurely 
in unhealthy countries, as well as the irre- 
gular and debauched. In such instances^ the 
particular nature of the climate acts as a pre- 
disposing cause of disease. 

It may be observed, that in all countries^ 
a greater number of children are destroyed 
by the absurd practice of loading their atos- 
machs with trash of every sort, and by af- 
terwards relieving them by repeated vomits 
or doses of physic, than by any natural prd- 
cess. 
Different No nations live entirely on animal, or en- 
Animal tiroly on vegetable food. The Bramins, 

taibi ^f^^d ^^^ ^^® said to live entirdy on vegetables, 
use milk, which is of an animal nature* 
The Laplanders, who are said to live entire* 
ly on animal food, use trefoil, artd other 
plants, very copiously. When therefore we 
speak of people^ as either carnivorous or 



149 



herbivorous^ we mean, that they use the 
one or the >other of them considerably in the 
larger proportion. 

Vegetable food in great proportion, parti- 
cularly in very hot countries, is far less nou« 
rishing than animal, and produces diarr- 
bsba, &c. ; but too much animal food loads 
and oppresses the body, causes indolence 
and dullness, after full meals, and requires 
the constant repetition of a sort of febrile 
action to throw it off, which tends greatly to 
wear out the constitution. 

• Fish has been, with probability, supposed, 
an its effects on the body, to hold a middle 
rank between othiBr animal and vegetable 
food« 

' In warm cUmates, particularly in the West 
Indies, the negroes become, in a much 
greater degree, lean, and are less able to 
XK^rk, whilat they subsist on rice, than while 
using almost any other sort of food. In 
their dispositions, too, they become more 
docile ; whereas animals of every descrip- 
tion, who are carnivorous, in whatever 
country they may be placed, are uniformly 
more fierce and courageous than others ex-* 
posed even to the same circumstances, who 
feed on vegetables. 

It has been supposed, that want of anti- 
septic food, and due motion of the body^

irill be found of themselves adequate to 
the production of disease^ without the ex- 
istence of putrid miasmata, or any other 
external cause. Dr Beddoes seems to 
think that the putrefaction of animal sub« 
stances in the stomach of man is a great 
cause of putrid and contagious disease. 
He says, ^^ as long as we gorge ourselves 
with animal food^ and dwell among its pu- 
trefactive recrements, the poisonous gazeous 
oxyd of azote proceeding therefrom must be 
expected to disturb both our respiratory and 
digestive functions^ and be followed by 
scenes of distress." 

It has been observed, (and it is an inter<* 
esting fact), that since sugar and the asces«> 
cent vegetables became a part of the diet of 
the people of this country, putrid diseases 
have been much less frequent than fonner« 
ly, when our forefathers lived upon grain 
and flesh, without a proper mixture of acids 
to correct their tendency towards putrefac- 
tion. 

It is worthy of remark, that artisans and 
labourers in the confined manufactories of 
large towns, suffer prodigiously in their 
health in seasons when there is a failure in 
the crops of common fruits. The labour- 
ing classes in this country, for instance, suf- 
fered much in their general health, from f^ - 



15^ 



ficarcity of common fruit during the year 
1804, and the failure again in 1805 was at** 
tended with similar effects. 

Spices contain no nourishing pnnciple ; g ^^ ^^ 
they are only useful in giving taste and fla- 
vour to other substances. Op account of 
their generally heating powers^ they oc^ht 
not to be pf daily use^ nor ought they at 
any time to be used in large quantity. The 
indigenous spicy herbs^ however^ such at 
parsley^ maijoram, thyme^ sage, and the like^ 
cannot be too much recommended for culi* 
nary uses, as they assist greatly in the digM* 
tion of the stronger articles of food. 

The internal coating of many culinary ofVeigeis. 
vessels being liable to solution by certain 
acids and oils, often prodi^ce very dangeroqf 
consequences. 

With regard to beverage, and to water in Of Water, 
particular^ we may fortunately conclude, with 
tolerable accuracy, that a country producing 
good water, enjoys likewise a salubrious 
air. 

Warm water, however, is always relaxing^ 
particularly^when taken in copious draughts* 
It also remains longer in the stqmach than 
(K>ld water, and consequently is more op* 
pressive : cold liqUor stimulates the stomach;^ 
but warm drink diminishes its elasticity. 



152 



pf Tct. Tea' taken twice a-day and in large quanw 

tities^ however grateful it may be, is prejudi- 
cial to the constitution. It relaxes the sto- 
inach, and weakens the energy of digestion. 
This, however, is not so common when the 
tea is strong, in moderate quantity, sufEU 
ciently diluted with milk or cream, and well 
.pweeteued with sugar ; for it is in reality the 
warm water more than the tea that is inju- 
rious. 

Tea, often immoderately used, is unques* 
tionably productive of various nervous com- 
plaints, which is very aggravating when w€f 
consider that we possess many valuable aro^- 
matic plants in our own country, which 
might with much greater safety be substitit- 
ted for it. Such are balm, peppermint, 
sage, the blossoms of the lime- tree, the black 
thorn, the leaves of the peach and almond- 
trees, and the first tender leaves of whortle 
berries. 
. One of the most invariable ejects of the 

« 

excessive use of tea, is frequent deliquum or 
fainting ; nor is this always unconnected with 
convulsive affections. These occur to many 
ladies who themselves are able to assign no 
rational cause for them ; and whose medical 
attendants too often overlook their real na- 
ture, and instead of withdrawing the excess 
sive use of tea, and substituting for it pofiee 



153 



or chocolate, as a morning beverage, dread- 
fully aggravate all these complaints, by the 
absurd prescription of a multiplicity of noxi- 
ous drugs. 

* I Hm still, however, of opinion, that tea, 
used as above-mentioned, and in moderation, 
is a delightful, exhilirating, and invaluable 
beverage. To literary men, and person^ ad- 
dicted to study, it is indispensible, and it is 
in general rejected only by the debauched, 
and those accustomed to the excessive use 
of wine and spirits. I know, however, some 
who are addicted to none of these, and who 
yet cannot use tea. 

- With regard to fermented liquors, all ^^^^ 
Icinds of beer ought to consist of water, malt, 
and hops alone ; but when to these are add- 
ed cocciUus indicusj nux vomica, copperas, &c 
it is highly destructive of health. 

A person who has a good appetite, indeed 
requires no beer for the digestion of his fqod, 
and by drinking it, he acquires a full ple- 
thoric habit, with all its concomitant com- 
plaints, ^eer with a head^ as it is called, 
shows that it is in an imperfect state of fer- 
mentation, from which spasms and colics are 
produced. . 

Cyder and perry, being generally made in of Cydcr 
leaden vessels, and suffered to rurt through ^"*^ ^"^ 
a leaden tube, which they corrode, lead is 



154 



thus introduced into the body^ and occa$ioii# 
the most painful and dangerous colics. 
Of Wine. A long continued use of wine uniforn^ 
}y destroys the health and digestive powers^ 
even although it be not carried to excess. It^ 
therefore, ought to be very sparingly used> 
and that only while likewise using food ; at 
dinner, for instance* 
Of Ardent The depravation of every valuable quality^ 
either of mind or body, occasioned by the 
immoderate use of spirits, ought to warn us 
against their too great use. The throat and 
stomach are rendered callous, and the glands 
about these parts are occasionally indurated^ 
so as almost to occasion suffocation. In con- 
sequence of this, we see irreparable injuries 
sustained by the nervous system, as debili^ 
ty of mind, and hypochondriasis, while jaun« 
dice^ dropsy, and consumption^, are its al-^ 
most invariable results. 

If sprits be distilled over peppermint^ 
balm, anniseed, or carraway, their strength 
is not much encreased ; but if over cinna- 
mon, cloves, mace, or other hot spices, they 
are rendered still more heating and pemtci-^ 
fms to health. 

Individuals of much sensibility ^nd irriti^ 
l^tlity, and persons after having taken violent 
^ercise, are more liable to become intox^** 



I5S 



^ated by their use, than those of a calm and 
a phlegmatic temperament. 

Attention to these particulars is too sel- Of 
dom considered in the light that its impor- the modr 
tance deserves, and by neglect of them we ^^ ^*^*'»g; 
acquire habits which can only be laid aside 
with the greatest difficulty, and often not 
without the greatest risk. It must be evi« 
dent to every one, that there is a common 
foutine in living, both in regard to food and' , 

drink, which, even althoughof itself it should 
|iot be much calculated for the preservation ^ 
of health, cannot, without risk, be laidaside^ 
^t least suddenly, even for one more evident- 
ly congenial to health. People who indulge 
in excess in cither of these matters, and 
suddenly depart from such habits, are, at all 
times, in the greatest danger of being seized 
by disease of every kind ; but more particu- 
larly by those epidemics, which, in every 
country, and under every circumstance, are 
from time to time known to prevail. 

Proper regulations for diet, which obviate, . 
or rather prevent the bad effects stated in 
this section, will be found under the title of 
police, &c. for modes of livings in the third 
section of the second part of this book.

Sect. IV. — Of Manners. 

In the whole range of science, there is per* 
haps no subject niore interesting than the 
consideration of the manners of mankind, 
and their effects, when vitiated, in the pro-' 
duction of disease. But the subject is per- 
haps as complex as it is interesting ; and it 
vill be necessary successively to examine the 
effects of the effluvia arising from the bodies 
of animals, becoming injurious to health 
from their not being removed ; the effects 
of actual inattention to cleanliness; the ef- 
fj^ts arising from improper dress ; those 
from improper exercise ; those from e^ces* 
sive or impeded evacuation ; those from im- 
proper exercise of the mind ; and those from 
the mismanagement of the periods of sleep,Scc* 



Of rt« Effluvia, often of the most deleterious qua- 

arising lities, but which have no perceptible smell> 
from the ftequently issue from the bodies of men and 

Bodies of ^ •' ..... 

AniBials. most other animals ; and various effluvia are 
emitted from different animalsperceptible only 
to certain other animals, and not to all alike. 
It is, for instance, well known among hunters, ' 
fowlers, &c. that setting- dogs, hounds, crows, 
and some other animals^ will be much more 



157 



sfFected by scents, or the odor6us effluvia 
of partridges^ hares, gun- powder, &c. when 
the wind blows from the object toward the 
animal, than when it blows the contrary way, 
which ever way the nostrils of the animal 
be turned^ if the air be imbued with the 
odorous steams ; and consequently, the dif- 
ference seems to proceed from this, that 
jvhen the nostrils are turned to the wind, 
the current of the air drives the steams for- 
cibly upon the organ, which otherwise it 
does pot. Blood-hounds can distinctly trace 
the footsteps of man merely by the sense of 
smelling, although no particular odour is to 
us emitted from his body. The scent too of 
the flying-deer will sometimes continue upon 
the ground for a whole day^ and sometimes 
more. 

It has also been known, with regard to the 
brute creation, that they may leave, upon 
vegetables that have touched their bodies 
for any length of time, such corpuscles, as 
though unheeded by other animals, may, 
when e^ten by them, produce in them such 
diseases as the infected animals had. 

In this and in similar ways, the air may Effect of 
be contaminated, or it may simply have im- ^^cscEfliu. 
parted to it odorous qualities, which seem- the Air. 
ingly prodpce no deleterious effects upon 
tbo^e who breathe it. Old persons, how- 



158 



ever, people of bad habit of body, or thosi 
labouring under diseases, and such as eat and 
drink immoderately, will contaminate the 
air much faster than the healthy, the mode«^ 
rate, and the young. W hen air is vitiated, 
in this way, it probably approaches nearer 
to that state of it from which diseaises arise4 
Effect of Many ridiculous, and some judiciout 
fluvUupon ^"o^g^ conjectures and experiments hav* 
Animal been made to ascertain the exact effect pro^i 
duced on animal substances when exposed 
to the influence of the different efBuvia aris* 
ing from various bodies. Alexander givel 
experiments to prove, that a piece of flesh 
will continue fresh a greater length of time 
when hung over putrid filth, than a similaf 
piece will when hung over fresh water. A 
consideration, however, which appears to rne 
to be of some importance, seems in these as 
well as in similar experiments to have beeri 
overlooked. What I allude to is, the pro- 
bability that dead flesh may be acted upon 
in a very different manner, and very different 
results may be the consequence in it, from 
those of the living animal exposed to similar 
circumstances. 
These ef. Habit, however, will do a gfeat deal in 
defied "by" rendering the body much less assailable by 
Habit, disease, from the impression of noxious ef- 
fluvia^ than it would otherwise be where na 



159 



such circumstance contributes to their pre- 
vention. This, indeed, I conceive to have 
an immense effect either in the prevention' 
or the propagation of disease. Thus habit, 
conjoined to the manners of living, of the 
inhabitants of many parts of the world, forti- 
fies them almost completely against disease, 
ifvhile they are actually ^existing in the im-^ 
mediate neighbourhood of most horrible 
masses of putrefying animal substances ; 
and while those less accustomed to live in 
iuch an atmosphere are, for the most part, 
seized by the most malignant distempers 
on suddenly exposing themselves to its in- 
fluence. 

It is in a great measure owing to these 
circumstances, that we see individuals of 
one family selected as victims of disease, 
while others of the same family are spared. 
It is to these, or the manner of living in ge- 
neral, that those who are employed in 
slaughtering animals for food enjoy an unin- 
terrupted flow of health, even while they are 
constantly in the habit of inhaling the n>ost 
Doxious vapours arising from putrefying 
masses of animal matters; and that marsh- 
drainers, who are always exposed to the 
influence often of the very worst kind 
of effluvia, enjoy their honiely fare with 
the keenest appetite, without even being 



i6o 



conscious that they inhale whh it containi^ 
nated air. 

It is on this principle, that while so many 
fall victims to disease, perhaps as many, if 
not more, equally exposed, are quite exempt* 
cd from them. Were it not for this, and 
perhaps similar causes, the bills of mortality 
in every part of the world would be greatly 
increased. The huge masses of putrefac- 
lion produced in the cities of London and 
Paris, for instance, amount^ in either of 
them, to eight or ten millions of pounds 
weight every year, which produce differ- 
ent effects according to the . different cir- 
cumstances particularly influencing the 
mind, the manners, &c. of those who are 
exposed to its influence. It is this, too^ 
which preserves the Hottentots at the Cape 
of Good Hope, where cleanliness and decent* 
cy are hardly known. They, too^ make us^ 
of the most rancid and putrid provisions^- 
and yet they are said to be as healthful a 
people as are any where to be found in the 
world. I am fully convinced, that sufficient 
attention has not been paid to considera- 
tions of this nature; nor have even such 
lessons, as men almost instinctively acquire/ 
been sufficiently dwelt upon, and pointed out 
for the benefit of others. 



ifii 



We are likewise sufficiently aware, that '^^^^ ^^' 

fects mo- 
certain states of the mind contribute^ in no dified by 

small degree, to the prevention, as well as of^xtokl'^ 
the production, of disease. We cannot have ^°S' 
a better instance of this than the wonderful 
eiFect such states of mind produce, as points 
edoutby Mr Bruce in his travels** . He ob- 
serves, that " the Turks and Moors are 
known to be predestinarians. • . . secure in 
this principle, they expose in the market- 
place^ immediately after St John's day, the 
idothes of the many thousands that have 
died during the late continuance of the 
plague, all of which imbibe the moist air of 
the evening and morning, are handled, 
bo^ight, put on, and worn, without . any ap- 
prehension of danger : and though these 
consist of furs, cotton, silk, and woollen 
cloths, which stuffs, are most retentive of 
the infection, no accident happens to those 
who wear them from their happy confi- 
dence *."

lar manners of the people, produce a state

generation and propagation of disease. The 
various states of health arid disease, too, 
contribute in no small degree to their pro- 
duction. A piece of meat, for instaaee, 
sooner putrifies that has been breathed upon 
by a person who has diseased lungs and a 
bad breath, than another of the same weight 
'that has been breathed upon for the same 
length of time by a sound person. 

With respect to the generation and pro^ 
pagation of those effluvia which constittrte 
disease, Dr Gullen observes, *^ It is now weM 
known that the effluvia constantly arising 
from the living body, if long retained in the 
same place, without being difixised in the 
atmosphere, acquire a singdlar virulence; 
and, in that state, being applied to the bo* 
dies of men, become the cauf^e of a fever 
which IS highly contagious ;'* and he fur- 
ther observes, *^ it is probable that the con- 
tagion arising in this manner is not, like 
many other contagions, permanent and con- 
stantly existing ; but that it is occasionally 
generated." 

A strong proof in favour of the opinicm, 
that air, thus contaminated, is a source of 
the plague, is, that, in all countries where 
that disease rages with the greatest violence, 
the cleaner houses are less liable to be in- 
fected by it than tlie dirty. It is not alone 



\63 



by the gross filth occasioned by the inatten- 
tion and carelessness of the people that dis- 
eases are propagated, for there are many 
€*hei* ways by which their violence may be 
pnesfefved, and it can alone be prevented by 
the stfictest attention' to every species of 
cleaiiliness^ even to those minute points 
which in themselves can Scarcely be called a 
direbt source of di^ase. 

With regard to vetotiiation, — one of the 
hest modes of obviating these bad efTect^^ 
Goont Rumford state^^ that however much 
heated by fires a room may be, the air of 
that room cannot . be adulterated ; as con- 
«ta»iit supplies of colder, and consequently 
b^aiHer air from without are necessary to 
kMp up that circulation within the room, 
wfaick makes the fire to burn. It is only in 
Yooms isimilar in coldness to the external air 
fUid where no circulation takes place, that 
the air must stagnate. 

Mr Howard gives upwards of thirty in- 
stances of the jail distemper in English pri- 
6^18, in consequence of the inattention of 
those whose duty it was to remedy such 
'evils by cleanliness, proper ventilation, &c. 
What renders attention to these circum- 
stances pressingly necessary, is, that the con- 
tagion, which produces infectious fever, not 

t2 



l64 



only originates from the accumulation of 
human effluvia, but is multiplied by the dis- 
ease which it occasions. By the activity 
and minuteness of effluvia, they most readi- 
ly insinuate themselves into our bodies in 
irmumerable ways : they pass into the 
mouths of the absorbent vessels^ always ly- 
ing open on the whole surface of the body ; 
we every moment swallow them with our 
saliva; with our very food they pass into 
our stomach ; our lungs receive them with 
every breathe we draw ; and thus they 'are 
blended with the blood. It is easy^ then, 
to conceive, that many and great alterations 
must necessarily be produced by the admis- 
sion of such acute and destructive agents 
into the inmost recesses of an animal ma- 
chine. It seem^ to be the nature c^siich 
' particles to assimilate into substances of 
their own kind, all fluids with which they 
have been mingled. 

Thus we see how small a portion of pu- 
trid animal matter introduced into the blood 
by inoculation, affects the whole, and> in a 
very short time, brings it into an equal state 
of corruption with itself. We may appeal to 
the truth of history for the ravages and de- 
vastations brought on great armies closely 
encamped^ and great. cities streightly be- 



l65 



sieged, all occasioned by the stenches and 
putrid exhalations arising from the corrup- 
tion of dead bodies lying above ground. 

If any thing could be further necessary to 
prove the truth of what I have here assert- 
ed, I would mention a melancholy instance 
among ourselves. I mean the great de- 
struction made by the jail fever at Oxford 
during the assizes, which has been so often 
recorded. In this case, from a number of 
persons closely confined, from filth and nas- 
tiness, . the consequence of such a circum- 
stance, from bad diet and pent up air, arose 
so contagious a putrefaction that it swept 
away the Judges, High Sheriff, Grand Jury, 
and great numbers of those who were at- 
tending the court, and in its ravages was 
little short of a plague. A latter instance 
again of the same kind, with similar melan^ 
choly circumstances, happened since that 
period at Taunton. 

Mr Hume observes, that Erasmus ascribes 
the frequent plagues in England to the nas- 
tiness and dirt, and slovenly habits among 
the people. ^* The floors," says he, ^* are 
commonly of clay, strewed with rushes, un- 
der which lies unmolested an antient col- 
lection of beer, grease, fragments, bones, 
spittle, excrements of dogs and cats, and 

L 3 



166 



every, thing that is nasty.'* TWs bears with 
it internal evidence of truth. 



Effects of '* ^s strange, that even in our own time 
t)irtincss. ^6 hear frequent assertions, that where the 
manners of the people are least of all culti- 
vated, where tjiey are habituated to filth of 
every description, there the most healthy 
and long-lived persons are to be found, and, 
in short, that diseases seldom annoy them. 
The fact of the matter is just this, that 
among these wretched and miseraUe abodes, 
few of those whose lives ought to be devot* 
ed to the alleviation of distress, wherever it 
is to be found, ever explore the sources of 
disease with sufficient attention to be able 
to give a true picture of its ravages. 
And it not being one of the least failings of 
the human mind to dwell on the miraculous 
and unaccountable, they rather choose to 
give a perplexing and paradoxical account 
of the operations of nature, than adhere to 
that simplicity which is evident in all her 
works. 

Is it even to be once supposed, that, during 
these times, or indeed during any time, 



i6r 



ivhen nastines^ and filth prevail, the inhabi- 
tants are more healthy than* when their 
manners are more polished, and these nui- 
aances unknown ? Is it to be supposed, 
that, during these early scenes of dirti- 
ness, when, in the military excursions of 
the ancient Scots, for instance^ they boiled 
their cattle in their hides, and made shoe^ 
of the undried skins while the hair was up- 
on them, and in every respect lived like sa^-. 
vages, that the inhabitants were most heal- 
thy ? Impossible ! Besides, we have th^ 
best medical authorities, however much these 
partial and discordant notions may prevail^ 
that the plague, pestilential fevers, putrid 
scurvies and dysenteries, have abated in Eu- 
rope within this last century, which we can 
ascribe to no other cause than our improve- 
iDjftnt in every thing relating to cleanliness, 
and the more general use of antiseptics. 
These diseases^ in short malignant diseases 
of every description, were in early times 
cnuch more prevalent in almost every coun- 
try than they have been for at least a centu- 
fy p^st, exceptijig indeed in places where 
the manners and custon)s of the people have 
become more unpolished, or where they 
have undergone very little change from the 
Refinements of modern iminrovcment. .

More ge- The more manifest causes of these dis- 

ncral cauS' . , . 

cs of these eases are, our permittmg the operation of 
cffbcts. i^j^g effects of stinking unburied carcases, 
overflowings of the sea, leaving dead fish 
putrefying in hollows among the mud, 
and similar causes, and the diseases aris- 
ing from them have been known to ac- 
quire such virulence, that even the fish in 
the neighbouring sea have died in conse^ 
quence of it. 

It is observed also, that the plague breaks 
out in Constantinople only in the lodgings 
of the lower orders, which are generally 
kept in a state of excessive filthiness ; the 
confined streets are in the same state, being 
generally strewed with the decaying remains 
of animal and vegetable substances ; and 
such being the condition of a great part of 
that city, considering the temperature of the 
climate, it is not to be wondered that it 
should scarcely ever be free of plague. 

Dr Lind observes, that at Bencoolen, in 
the East Indies, the diseases that always rage 
most violently during the month of Octo- 
ber, are occasioned by dead fish and other 
animals left by the Ganges ; and that the 
unhealthfulness of Gambroon arises from 
vast quantities of little fishes left upon the 
shore, which soon become highly putrid^ 
and contaminate the air. 



169 



Several, both ancient and modern writers, 
in enumerating the causes of the putrid dy* 
sentery and fever, which so frequently at- 
tacks armies encamped in rainy seasons, and 
towards the beginning of winter, have reck- 
oned the effluvia arising from the privies as 
one of the most active and virulent. 

Considering the filthy habits of the Egyp- 
tians, and that the country is liable to be 
covered with water, stagnating under a 
burning sun, and filled with decaying ani- 
mal and vegetable remains, it will hardly be 
doubted, that diseases of the worst descrip- 
tion must be occasionally generated in that 
cburitry. 

Through the midst of Grand Cairo passes 
a great canal, which is filled with water at 
the overflowing of the Nile, and after the 
river has decreased, is gradually dried up. 
Iilto this, the people throw all manner of 
filth, carrion, &c. so that the stench which 
arises from this, and the mud together, is 
insufferably offensive. In this state of 
things, the plague every year preys upon the 
inhabitants, and is only stopped when the 
Nile, at its next overflow, washes away this 
load of filth ; the cold winds, which set in 
at the same time, lending their assistance 
by purifying the air. 



170 



More par- In places where civilization has scarcely 
wuses of ^^^^ reached, these scenes are barely ex- 
thcse cf. cusable ; but in more polished states, and in 
the very neighbourhood of the most accom- 
plished circles, to find these is disgraceful 
in the extreme, while it adds to the danger 
of every person within their influence. 

Among the lower orders of society, the 
manners are, from a variety of causes, most 
likely to be productive of disease. They 
are little habituated to cleanliness^ and are 
liable to a thousand accidents, and a thou- 
sand temptations, which every superior rank 
of life is free from ; and they feel not, from 
want of education, the same happy exertion 
of delicacy, honour, and moral sentiment, 
which every where else is to be met with. 
In many parts even in our own island, with- 
in one small room, will be found a man and 
his wife, with five, six, seven, or even more 
children. One wretched bed-stead, with 
scarcely any bedding, constitutes the princi- 
pal part of the furniture, and the persons of 
the inhabitants are all in the highest degree 
filthy and offensive. 

When to this, is added the internal filth 

' of their houses ; for neatness is not often to 

be met with among their sordid dwellings in 

particular, the scene must be about complete. 

When one set of inhabitants leave such a 



171 



residence, they are succeeded by another, 
without either inclination or intermediate 
time being allowed for purifying the apart- 
ment ; and thus disease is perpetuated by a 
succession of fresh causes of, and subjects 
for its attack. One unaccustomed to breathe 
in such places, feels on coming out of them, 
headach and giddiness. Habit, however, 
in this, as in every other thing, has a won- 
derful effifct, and it can only be from this 
circumstance, that, frequent as deaths are, 
they would be much more frequent, if only 
partially exposed to such causes of disease. 
Children and women constantly residing in 
such infected apartments, seem to get ha- 
bituated to the action of the fomites. Men 
and boys, by means of fresh air and the ex- 
ercise of the day, shake off the effects of the 
virus, and escape long unhurt. It must, 
however, be observed, that if, through tak- 
ing cold, or any other cause, they should be 
confined to the house for a few days, they 
assuredly take the fever. It is acknowledged 
by every one, that the most malignant fdvers 
and the worst of every kind of disease, are to 
be found in such places, and in a particular 
manner, if their inhabitants, which frequent- 
ly happens, be clothes-brokers. The clothes 
sold in these places, thoroughly penetrated 
by contagious effluvia, are purchased by 



172 



healthy persons^ without suspicion ; and 
thus fever, &c. may be carried to and pro- 
pagated among the servants of the rich, and 
they themselves roust infallibly partake of 
the general suffering. Thus it is fevers are by 
servants often introduced into a family who 
are unsuspicious of its approach, and gene^ 
rally unable to account for its origin. 

Another circumstance, by no means coiv. 
solatary, is, that linen and other apparel, 
sent to lawn^dresses in close parts of any 
town, must sometimes return to families, 
thoroughly impregnated with the effluvia of 
putrid fever, scarlatina, small- pox, hooping^ 
cough, or dysentery, &c. 

Even in Britain, few make any doubt ol^ 
the great danger attending wet rooms, and 
damp clothes or beds ; yet they are allowed 
to exist every where, without considerations 
of that importance being attached to them, 
which they are entitled to. 

Among these people exist customs high- 
ly destructive of health. It is usual, for 
instance, in houses inhabited by the lower 
orders of society, to wash and dry their 
clothes in the apartments in wliich thej 
sleep, and the effluvia arising from these 
clothes mixing with the already vitiated air 
of such apartments^ causes catarrhs^ &c» 
among them.

Thus every sort of nastiness, which, from 
the gross and unpolished manners of the 
people, is accumulated, has long been felt 
^s a cause of diseases. Partial improvements, 
in these respects, have been made, and al^ 
though from them the best effects have been . 
experienced, no general plan for their re- 
moval has, so far as I know, ever been at- 
tempted. On the contrary^ while one im- 
proven[)ent is taking place, a fresh nuisance, 
equally destructive in its consequence, makes 
its appearance. It would however appear, that 
the police of foreign countries in general, is in 
a much better state in respect to these im« 
provements than it is in any part of Great 
Britain; yet even with them, the plans are 
far from being perfect. 

A perusal of Mr Howard's book on the la Prisons* 
state of prisons, will convince any one, that 
the accumulated distresses which the want 
of cleanliness and ventilation produce ; and 
which, notwithstanding the hints he has 
given, have been by no means sufficiently 
attended to, ought to occupy a very important 
part of the time of the legislature. These poor 
unfortunate wretches, whose situations he so 
ably and feelingly describes, werewholly inca- 
pable of bettering their situation. Their vices 
were the cause of their sufferings, and they 
were obliged to endure the hardness of their 



174 



fate without a murmur. I know that ne- 
cessity will make many bear a great deal ; 
but when we find in common life, that vo- 
luntary confinement is quietly submitted to 
in filthy hovels, which, in many respects, are 
not more favourable to the preservation of 
health, than those he has described, we can- 
not help ascribing this sort of conduct to a 
kind of mania, which nothing but the inter- 
ference of the Legislature can prevent. These 
slothful habits destroy all inclination in such 
people, even to partake of those advantages 
which they can command, and thus they 
become so habituated to wallow in filth, thaft 
they even lose those feelings which their 
wretchedness at first creates ; arid their chil- 
dren are trained up to habits equally pernici- 
otis to the physical as to the moral powers. 
In those prisons, where attention is paid 
to the comfort, and consequently to the 
health of their inhabitants, the good effects 
of it are manifest. Mr Howard gives many 
instances of this, and among others, he gives 
as an example what occurred in one of the 
prisons at Paris. " They have," says he^ 
" clean linen once a- week from a society 
which was established about the year 1753. 
The occasion of it was the prevalence of a 
contagious disease, which in France they 
call le scorbutf the scurvy. The distemper 



175 



was fo^iad to proceed from the prisons, ^nd 
to spread to the Ho$el Djeu^ whither prison- 
ers that had it were removed. > Hiecause of 
it was generaHy thought to be want of clean « 
liness in priBons ; where sev^eral of those coin 
£oed had worn their linens for many months, 
and infected the most healthy new-comers 
that were put into the room with them." 
He adds, that *' this pat an effectual stop to - 
the malady in that prison.** It seems to me 
a very clear point, that those habits which 
induce disease m prisons, will similarly pro- 
duce them in those habitations where the 
same habits exist and similar rnanners are 
adopted. 

y I again mention it, that were the dis^ 
^eaacs thus gjenerated confined to such si- 
tuations, the evil, although greait, would 
be, compaiiatively speakings ^f a trrfling na- 
ture to what it really is when \ve consider, 
that while these diseases exist, it is impossi- 
ble to prevent them being carried to, and 
committing th^ most unwished-for devasta- 
tions in the rery houses of tS^ose, who, bad 
they exerted the power invested in them, 
might have prevented such cbnseqiiences. 

It is an old observation among those who in Gamps. 
have attended to the diseases in camps, 
that they really did not so much seem to 
arise from the dampness of the situation^ as 



176 



from the tnen lying in their clothes, and the 
want of proper bedding. As a clear proof 
of this, it has always been founds that the 
ofEcers and others^ placed in similar circum- 
stances, but who attended more particularly 
to these points, escaped such diseases. The 
effect of cleanliness and regularity of man- 
ners have a wonderful influence on the 
health, even when persons have few oppor- 
tunities of exercise, or even of walking into 
the open air. 

Although, among the dwellings of the 
poor, we can trace the rise and progress 
of various diseases with some accuracy; 
yet we have not that extensive field for 
observation among them, that we have 
in camps, jails, or large hospitals, where, 
"when proper measures are not adopted for 
their prevention, diseases, similar in their 
nature, but more extensive in their effects, 
are produced. In Sir John Pringle's works, 
we have many instances of this kind, and, 
with him, it seems an established principle, 
that inattention to cleanliness produces many 
diseases ; for, he says, " that, in proportion 
to the nastiness of such places, the number 
of dysenteries, of foul sores, and especially 
of mortifications, occur, and the malignant 
fever is both frequent and mortal.*' He gives 
an instance of a severe malignant fever, with 



177 



Sunk pulse and stupor^ having occurred in 
the ward of an hospital where a man lay ill 
of an extensive mortification of his limbs. 
And it has been asserted by others, that it i$ 
highly probable, that a vapour, allied in its 
properties and effects to this gas, gives, oc- 
casion to the frequency of typhus amongst 
people exposed to the effluvia arising from 
putrefying animal and v^etablb matters ; asl 
in the narrow lanes of crowded cities, in 
farm-yards, burying-grounds, and some ma^ 
nufactories. 

It is upon similar principles, th^t there is 
scarce an instance of a town being long in- 
vested, without some fatal malady of this kind 
occurring. Sometimes it may be owing to the 
filth of the place crowded with people, and 
cattle brought in for shelter, as formerly 
happened both at Athens and at Rome. At 
other times, the sickness has been occasioned 
by corrupted grain, and meats long salted, be-^ 
coming putrid. Vegetables also^ rotting in a 
close place, yield a cadaverous smell, and we 
have instances of malignant fevers occasion- 
ed by the effluvia of putrid cabbages, aS 
well as of plants in marshes. After Battles 
too, when vast numbers of dead bodies have 
been left in the field or thrown into the ad- 
jacent rivers, the waters have been so far cor- 
rupted as to occasion malignant and infeC'^

Burying 
Graundj. 



tiouB diseases amongst the neighbouring 
inhabitants. 

In all countries indeed, epidemic diseases, 
extraordinarily mortal, are generally bred ia 
jails, sieges, camps, &c. and by authors have 
been called pestilential. 

Putrid effluvia, thus destructive to hu- 
man life, have been long known as the source 
of disease ; but they have not been univer- 
sally considered with an intention to their 
removal. As one instance of this, the im- 
propriety of allowing burying grounds to 
exist in the midst of cities, becomes evi- 
dent; for, even in the most temperate cli- 
mates, the pernicious effects of the matters 
evolved from accumulated masses of putre- 
fying bodies, are daily experienced; and, on 
that account, no subject has a higher claim 
than this to the attention of those who have 
the management of the internal police of 
cities. 

Pere Cotte gives the case of a grave-dig- 
ger at Montmorenci, in 1773, who, by ac- 
cidentally opening the coffin of a person 
bujied only a year before, was suddenly til- 
ed by a vapour that issued from it. In the 
same year too, he mentions, that there arose 
a vapour from the coffin of a person recent- 
ly buried, during the time of a funeral, and 
that of liO persons who were present, j 14 



17q 



became ill of a putrid feren Mr Robertson 
mentions, that a similar occurrenoe took 
place in West Linton some years ago; a 
bchobl-boy getting into a new made gravej 
iiet about opening the projecting corner of 
a coffin, which, as^ soon aiSt he had pene- 
trated^ there issued from it a strong nauseous 
smdli on which he exclaimed he was sufib* 
cated ; he revived^ oh being taken out of the 
place, but fell immediately ill of a petechial 
fever, of which h« died on the seventh day ; 
and by this means a amilaf fever was com- 
municated to some of the people who 
attended him during his illness. We must 
all be aware, that animal putrefaction, even 
in these northern climates, produces very 
fatal distempers, though they do not arise to 
the malignity of the plague. 
What I hdve here advanced of the origin pondud- 

. ^ ing Obser- 

of the plague, appears to me so reasonable, vations on 
that it is wonderful that authors should quit ^^subjccSj 
Ihe consideration of such manifest causes 
for hidden qualities, such as malignant in- 
fluences, &c. Other distempers, not com- 
monly attributed to the efiects of filth, 
havis their origin evidently in this source. 
The origin of the disease of rickets in- 
cident to children, has been traced to 
have first appeared in Dorset and Somerset- 
shire in Eng^land. The Plica Pohniea, pci- 



180 

culiar to certain provinces of Poland, ha^ 
as well as the former^ solely arisen from nasti*^ 
ness and filth* 



Of DrcM. We cannot Enough admire the beauty of 
nature in furnishing animals with coverings 
suited to the climate in which they live. 
Thus the arctic bear is covered with the 
densest fur to protect him from the perpetu 
al cold of the polar regions ; while the 
greater number of animals indigenous to the 
torrid zone are almost naked : Thus^ also, 
the sheep of northern climes^ when transport- 
ed to the souths exchanges its wool for hair. 
From this we might conclude^ that the 
dress of man ought to be accommodated to 
the climate in which he lives^ without^ how- 
ever scrupulously attending to all its vicissi- 
tudes. Indeed^ it is impossible that we 
should do so ; we can onlyJoUowy and by no 
means anticipate them, and must have ex- 
perienced their worst effects before any 
change can be adopted. To change our 
mode of dressing only after we have sustain- 
ed these effects cannot by any means obvi- 
ate them. 

The baneful custom, however, of accommo- 
dating our dress to the almanack and the fa- 
shion^ rather than the vicissitudes of the wea- 



181 



ther, in this inconstant climate, must neeesir 
iBarily be productive of many disagreeable 
consequences. 

As connected with the same subject, it 
may be observed, that some who have cer- 
tain days about the change of the seasons 
for putting on and for putting off their fires, 
generally suffer severely from catarrh about 
these times. 

Cloathing, it ms^ be observed, is general- 
ly warm, or otherwise, both from. its texr 
ture, and from the particular colour by 
which it is enabled to attract and conduct 
lieat more or less slowly. 

In warm countries, where fur is a com- 
«ion article of dress, the danger arises from 
its tendency to retain noxious effluvia ; such 
as those of the plague among the Turks, 
putrid fevers in Hungary, and the singular 
disease of Plica Polonica in Poland, where 
the hair becomes greasy, and forms distinct 
strings. 

With regard to the head-dress, it may be 
observed, that black heavy^ hats in warm ' 
climates are extremely improper, particular- 
ly among those who are obliged to undergo 
severe exercise. They are ill calculated for 
people in such situations, both from their 
weight, and on account of the power black 

substances have of absorbing heat, 

m3 



183 



Probably, also, the immense quantities of 
pomatum and powder plastered over the 
whole surface of the heads of some, gives 
origin to headachs, by putting a stop to 
perspiration. Where, however, these com- 
plaints arise from la disorder in the digestive 
organs, which is by no means uncpmnxxi, 
this custom can in these instances have ve- 
ry httle effect. 

The neck unnecessarily loaded with sa« 
pf'rfluous clothing, and bound too tight to 
prevent the natural motions of the head, 
causes much uneasiness, and is productive 
of apoplexies, &c, which might have been 
easily prevented. 

It is now many years since the barbaroos 
custom of wearing on the body tight laced 
stays have been justly laid aside. It would 
appear, however, in some instances, that 
they are beginning again to be worn. I 
sincerely hope, however, that the custom 
will never be $o common as it has been, for 
by indulging in it much disease was produ- 
ced. The itt,e. expansion of the lungs was 
prevented ; the breasts became cancerous ; 
the ribs and spine, from constant compres* 
sion, became distorted ; shortness of breath 
followed, and, in many, terminated in con^ 
siimption ; the digestive organs suffered de- 
rangement, and frequent nausea and vomit- 



183 



ing followed. In short, numberless diseases 
were the consequence of that vicious cus^ 
tom^ which I sincerely hope we shall never 
again witness. 

Wedging the feet into too tight boots or 
shoes is a very common^ yet very injurious 
|Hactice. Very bad corns^ and at length 
considerable lameness^ is produced by theoi^ 

With regard to dress in general^ it may 
be observedi that the very sparing quantity 
of it used by many of the fair $ex» particu<* 
larly by the young, is very inexcusable, be- 
ing highly destructive even to the strongest 
constitution^ 



OB 



use. 



Exercise is of two kinds, the active and o/ Exc?* 
the passive. Under the first we rank walk- 
ing, running, leaping, swimming, ridings 
fencing, the military exercise, athletic games, 
and all that requires muscular exertion. 
Passive exercise comprises riding in a car-f 
riage, sailing, friction, swinging, &c. 

With regard to exercise, we may in gene- 
ral observe, that the exertion of every facul^ 
ty we possess is absolutely necessary for the 
preservation of health, and that these facul- 
ties must be used for a great period of pur 
lives in the open air, requires no proof on 
my part. No kind or degree of excrviw 

M4 



184 



within doors is nearly so beneficial to the 
health of the individual as the same sort of 
exercise would be in the open air. Thiar 
can most satisfactorily be accounted for 
from the comparative impurity of the at- 
mosphere whicH must be breathed within 
doors. Were exercise alone necessary, the 
employment of many individuals is calculat- 
ed to give them every chance of benefiting 
from it ; yet, unless much of the time de- 
voted to it be employed in the open air, the 
organs of respiration and digestion, and con- 
sequently those of secretion, are frequently 
disordered. I know that exceptions may be 
adduced to overturn this, or any principle, 
but it is not on exceptions to general rules 
that we are to found any reasoning which 
we wish to be universally applicable. 

Any individual faculty, however, or all of 
them, may be either improved in its powers, 
or greatly injurejd by the kind or degree of 
exercise which is employed. And as this 
, may be used judiciously, or otherwise, health 
is preserved to a very old age, or this state 
may be prematurely brought on, and the 
natural term of existence considerabfy 
shortened. 

Mental exertion must also have a share iq 
causing these changes. 

It is difficult to lay down any general 



185 



rvle upon this subject^ as what may be 
highly proper for one individual may be 
hurtful to another. When, however, bodi- 
ly exercise is used to excess, it acts in many 
respects like general stimuli taken into the 
stomach. Violent exercise of body and 
mind persisted in for ^ny length of time, 
indeed, brings on early age and premature 
death* 

When, however, exercise is used in mo- 
deration, it increases the heat of the body, 
and frequency of the pulse, and invigorates 
the mind. A marked distinction has been 
drawn between exercise and motion : and 
distinctions of this sort have been recom- 
lAended by authors during certain diseases, 
It has, for instance, been asserted, that while 
moderate exercise increases the pulse and the 
heat of the body, motion, for example, in a 
swing, lessens both. In some, exercise ex- 
cites coughing, motion as frequently pre- 
vent? or removes it. Violent exercise, or 
iexercise too long continued, occasions 
sweating, fatigue, and languor ; motion in- 
vigorates even the most weakly, nor can it 
occasion sweating, or be followed by fa« 
tigue. 

Swimming in cold water after having us-, 
ed violent exercise is very pleasant, but ye-? 
ry pernicious. 



18<$ 



The almost complete want of exercisei. 
which is too common among ladies and among 
literary and sedentary people^ brings on diffi* 
dence, fear, grief, dejection, disfMntedness^ 
and timorousness among those who were he^ 
fore the most intrepid. People indolgtiig in 
these habits are easily frightened, and the 
most trifling incident makes them tremble. 
Fear of death fills them with horrors^ They 
become incapable of attention : memory a( 
length fails them ; ideas become confused { 
palpitations and great dejection trouble thenw 
At night, they are fatigued and cast down, 
sleep becomes disturbed, and they are c^ten 
incapable of thinking. 

Any long continued posture of the body^i 
also, either in lying, sitting, or standing, is 
injurious to health ; we ought therefore to 
attend to these changes, which are as ne» 
cessary as alternate changes of tranquilli^ 
and activity are to the mind. 

Too much or too little exercise are eqmd* 
]y productive of disadvantages, the least of 
these, however, particularly among chtldrenj 
arise from the first. Sudden transition 
from the one tp the other is on aU occasions 
hurtful. 

Dancing, under proper limitationsf, is an 
admirable exercise, but this being oftcQ 
carried too far, is productive of pemipioiis 



187 



effects. On such occasions, the efFects of 
heating liquors, of sudden access to the cold 
air^ the imprudent use of cooling drinks and 
ipe itself, induce inflammatory disorders, 
spitting of bloody and evien consumption of 
the lungs. 

Immoderate dancing in very warm rooms, 
and aflerwards sudden exposure to the cold 
night air, is also very common and very de- 
atructive. 

All. kinds of exercise in a circle, such b$ 
in swinging cars, which move on a wheel 
with perpendicular pivots^ are improper, 
when they produce giddiness or nervous 
symptoms, which they are very apt to do. 

Flaying on wind instruments is, particu- 
larly in debilitated persons, an exercise very 
pernicious to health, inducing spitting of 
blood, cough, shortness of breath, and even 
pulmonary consumption. It would there- 
fore be advisable for those fond gf that de- 
lightful art to exercise their powers on other 
instruments less injurious to health. 

Exercise immediately after meals is high- 
ly improper, as it prevents the process of 
digestion, producing in many sickness, eruc- 
tations, heartburn, and even vomitings. 
Persons, Ijowever, who are, by custom, in 
the habit of moving after meals, in general 
^scape these inconveniences.

/ 

If, after a fatiguing walk, while the body 
is in a state of perspiration, we sit down to 
dinner or supper, the worst consequences 
may ensue, particularly if we begin witlj 
cooling dishes, or take any cold drink. 



Of the 
Evacua^ 

tions. 

Perspira- 
tion. 



It is generally observed, that if a strong 
healthy man, who uses moderate exercise 
in good weather, eats and drinks eight 
pounds during 24 hours, he will discharge 
five of them by insensible perspiration. 

From certain religious habits inducing' 
extraordinary perspiration, it has been sup- 
posed, that those who practised them were 
more obnoxious to particular endemic dis- 
eases than others who were not similarly in- 
fluenced. The religion of the Turks, for 
instance, enjoins frequent ablutions ; and it 
is well known, that constant warm bathings 
by relaxing the fibres, must dispose the bo- 
dy to the attacks of disease. Add to this 
their abstinence from wine and all ferment* 
ed liquors, the great antidotes to such at- 
tacks. 

Although I am by no means disposed (a« 
is too often the case with those who wish t^ 



189 



support a particular hypothesis or theory,) 
to attribute to the partial suppression or vi- 
tiated state of any of the natural discharges 
of the body, such a vast variety of diseases 
as are supposed to arise from such effects, 
yet I certainly am of opinion, that from 
their derangement much uneasiness, and of- 
ten disease, may arise ; and, in short, while 
any of them continue in that state, the full 
possession of health cannot be enjoyed. 
Since health, therefore, so evidently depends 
on a free perspiration, which also supposes 
an unrestrained circulation, those who all at 
once, or too early in the season, change their 
thick for light apparel, and they likewise 
who are much abroad when the weather is 
cool, windy, or wet, more especially if they 
be weakly, run some risk from the tempora- 
ry contraction of the surface of the skin that 
may thence be produced. And these e^cts 
will ever be greater, from equal causes, in 
weak than in strong persons, who bear 
every intemperature of the weather best. 

Perspiration is weaker after a plentiful 
meal, but when the food is digested, we 
again perspire with increased energy ; thus, 
going to bed immediately after supper, when 
this evacuation is suffering a temporary sup- 
pression, is improper ; we therefore ought 
to sit at least two hours after supper, and to 



igo 



afford thi^ ifenefit both to the organs of d[i* 
gestion and perspiration : the absurdly late 
hours of taking supper is highly improper. 

It must be observed, that by perspiratioici 
I do not mean sweating. When pen^piraUe 
matter collects in drops it should then be 
called sweau and is no longer a natdral and 
necessary evacuation. Instead of the body 
being invigorated by it as by perspirationi 
it is enfeebled, and prepared for the attack 
of disease. 

Inattention to cleanliness^ cohtribulen 
greatly to the suppression of insensible per« 
spiration ; hence those who do not (ray par- 
ticular attention to this circumstance, must 
suffer jfrom suppressed perspiration in the 
greatest degree. 

The reciprocal connection between the 
functions of the stomach, and persj^ration^ 
is so obvious, that if the latter be checkedi 
the former is immediately affected, and the 
reverse takes place if the stomach be disor* 
dared. 

Whatever food oppresses the digestive 
organs has a great effect in obstructing per- 
spiration. Depressing passions of the mind^ 
too, have a great effect upon this evacua- 
tion. 

No evacuation is so apt to occasion un- 
easiness as suppressed insensible perspirriii 



m 



tion. Peevishness, headachy disturbed sleqi 
and general heaviness, are some of the symp • 
toms which it induces; but when that 
function is allowed to proceed naturally, we 
leel vigorous, lively, and contented. 

When perspiration takes place while the 
body is covered with linen, the same degree 
of absorption does not take place as when 
we wear flannel, or rather thick cotton : 
the linen remains clogged, and is thus ap« 
{died to the surface of the body, much re- 
duced in temperature even below the exter- 
nal atmosphere. Thus diseases of the very 
worst kind are produced,^ such as colds, 
gout, diarrhasa, inflammation of the lungs, 
or other contiguous parts ; aind, in those of 
consumptive habits, it hastens the approach 
of that disease. Indeed, innumerable other 
complaints arise from similar causes, where 
perspiration is stopt. 

Tbe urine, during a state of good health, Urine. 
particularly in the morning, is thin, clear, 
of a straw colour, inclining to yellow ; it 
inakes no foam but what immediately va- 
nishes, and has no unusually disagreeable 
BmeH. On account of the increased pers- 
piration in warm weather, it is then most 
scanty. In hysteric and hypochondriac 
persons it is, during the existence of these 
complaints, of increased quantity, and very 



192 



pale ; it is of a whitish colour after using 
much weak drink, and, in debilitated perr 
sons, the foam remains on the surface of it 
for a considerable time. In these different 
states, however promising in appearance the 
health of individuals may be, it is by no 
means to be depended on. 

After too little drink, the immoderate, use 
of spirituous liquors, violent exercise, or a 
restless night, the urine is of a red colour ; 
and when the stomach is disordered, and 
the tongue covered with white or yellow 
matter, the sediment is of a colour resem- 
bling brick dust. 

The evacuation of urine ought dways to 
bear some proportion to the drink we use, 
making due allowance for perspiration. 
This must be in general greatly modi^ed by 
the relative state of vigour, or of debility, 
mode of life, and by dry or damp weather. 

We must not, if we value our health, re- 
tain the urine too long, as this practice' 
would occasion relaxation of the bladder, 
and other troublesome diseases ; nor ought 
we to accustom ourselves to void it too of* 
ten, as this occasions an unnecessary exer- 
tion, which must likewise be hurtful. 

Retention of urine is always attended wit& 
inconvenience, and sometimes with danger. 
It is termed strangury^ when only a few dropy 



/ 

193 

can be passed at a time ; dysuria, when this 
operation is attended by pain ; and ischuria 
when a complete retention of it takes place. 

With regard to the alvine excretion, re- ^ivjncEi. 
. galarity is indispetisibly requisite, and the crcti<m. 
opposite habits of too great facility or too 
gteat difficulty, in making this Evacuation, 
are equally to be guarded against : in both 
states, aperient medicines are necessaiy t 
bat that must be, in a great measure, regulat* 
ed by the causes of these compkints, or the 
other symptoms with which they are con- 
nected. The vefy frequent use of aperient 
medicines is highly pernicious ; and it must 
be observed^ that the necessity of Using them 
may almost always be obviated by due at- 
tention to the various points of diet and re- 
gimen. 

With regard to the catamenia, they alsb Catamcuia, 
Ought to be perfectly regular. They may^ 
however^ either be excessive or suppressed, 
and both of these occurrences are equally to 
be guarded against. Extreme distress fre- 
quently attends these states, but as they are 
generlilly attended by sonie more general 
and more serious derangement of the system^ 
medical advice ought instantly to be resort*^ 
edto.

B^anria^ 



Of the o- Passions operate upon A6 body eichw 
and s7at«jf Suddenly, or slowly and gradually. Men' of 
LI* d^ strong imagination chiefly suffer from pas- 
sions of the violent kind, while thbse cS 
more understaildi^Rg'ahd less fancyVare suIk 
ject to slower emotions of the mind. Indo^' . 
lent persons, whose sensations are dull, are 
less passionate than those who combine 
acute feelings and a lively imagination^ wift 
a clear understanding. It is from these 
states of mind,- that the same caus6 in differ-^ 
ent individuals will produce almost entirely 
opposite effects. Diseases of the mind, too^ 
after some time, produce various disorders of 
the body, as diseases of the body occasion-: 
ally terminate in imbecility. Indeed, the 
passions of the mind are of themselves capa* 
ble of producing disease, and of increasing 
or of diminishing its severity. 

Wherever' the cultivation of the mind is 
neglected, the passions are rude and bois- 
terous, a love for those virtuous reflnements- 
which endear us to our fellows is never cul-^ 
tivated, and ungovernable rashness and bi^ti^ 
taJitv entirely sway us 

The doiiiinion over, our passions and af- 
fections, however^ is a dif&cult task^ but it is 



I'g* 



ail' essential and indt^ensable I'e.quisite to 
heahii. For it canhdt be doubted, tli.at 
those who, at an early docile age, cpihbinQ 
s^Ktf principles of virtue With a sober atid 
active life, and who are, by frequent ^x^n^- 
ple^, r^ihinded of the' t attitude and disad- 
vantages: attending violent passions in othei^^ 
will of thertiselveS repress those enemies to 
human happiness. 

Too strong emotion ot the mind is at- 
t^iidecf with relaxation and He^vinesif. on 
which account persons of* vlblent and un- 
contn^ble passions ought ckutibusly to aivoid 
gambling. 

To force ourselves to exertions of any 
kiiid, and particularly those of the mind^ can 
lead' only to imperfect performances. 

Joy enlivens all the corporeal powers, and, 
ari it were, pervades the whole ahinlal' ftame. 
Hop6 has nearly si similar effect ; and these 
two affections contribute more to the' pre- 
s^ratibn of health and life th^n all the me- 
dicines that can be administered'. 

Hope i^ the presentiment of an expected 
good, or the anticipation of joy. The sense 
of happiness involved by hope far exceeds 
the Satisfaction received from immedialte en- 
joyment ; it consequently hais a more bene- 
ficial influence on health tlian good fortune 

N2 



106 



absolutely realised. Hope is^ indeed, the 
only genuine source of human happiness. 

Of joy, the different degrees are^ gaiety, 
cheerfulness, mirth, exultation, rapture, and 
extacy. 

The physical state of the body i& most 
happy, when the mind enjoys a moderate 
degree of gaiety, such as is generally met 
with in healthy and virtuous persons. 

Habitual joy and serenity, arising from 
perfection and due subordination of all 
our faculties, and their lively exercise, on 
objects agreeable to them, constitute mental 
or rational happiness. 

Sudden and excessive joy, however, may 
cause laceration of some of the vessels, spitting 
of blood, fevers, deprivation pf understanding, 
swooning, and even sudden death. On this 
account, we ought to fortify ourselves with 
that share of firmness which is necessary to 
meet joyful as well as disastrous tidings. 

Love, viewed in its most favourable light, 
presents to us a picture of permanent joy. 
The changes which this passion can efiect 
on the whole disposition of the mind, are re- 
markable. Man, in that state, sets all diffi- 
culties at defiance, he surmounts every ob- 
stacle, and is enabled to perform the noblest 
and most heroic actions^ 



197 



But an extravagant degree of love, or such 
as transgresses the bounds of reason, is no 
longer a pleasure, but a painful state of 
mind, attended with the most irregular emo- 
tions. It gradually consumes the vital pow- 
ers, prevents nutrition, and reduces the bo- 
dy to a skeleton. 

Disappointed love is extremely detrimen- 
tal to health, and gradually destroys the bo- 
dy. It usually shews itself by a reserved I 
melancholy, a general distrust, and a gloomyi 
misanthropy, which, however, appears exter- 
nally only under the character of lassitude ' 
and depression. 

This menial disorder, to which females j 
indeed are most subject, should be opposed 
in time by physical, but chiefly by moral re- , 
medies. Exalted ideas of virtue, of magna* 
nimity, and a generous self denial, are ex- 
cellent antidotes to it. The physical reme- 
dies are, rigid temperance, constant employ- 
ment, and much exercise ; but the most 
successful of all is a happy marriage. 

Envy principally exists in the weak and 
ignorant, and is principally exerted when 
they witness the prosperity of jjersons who 
possess superior endowments. Joy at the 
misfortunes, or the discovered foibles of 
others, self-love, calumny of their neigh- 
bours, satire and ridicule, are the never?

Sorrow seldom proves suddenly fatal^ but 
like a slow poison, corrodes the powers of 
the mind and body. Under its influeneey 
the face generally turns pale, frequent sigb- 
ings follow, with a vitiated appetite and di* 
gestion. 

When sorrow is not too intense, tears ge- 
nerally accompany it ; they are the ano^ 
dynes of grief, and ought not to be restrain- 
ed* The flow of tears diminish the spas- 
modic motions in the breast and head, and 
restores the respiration to regularity. Thus 
persons, after a plentiful flpw of tears^ fed 
greatly relieved. 

Those whose minds are liable to sorrow, 
ought to avoid as much as possible the com* 
pany of persons who are fond of relating 
their calamities, and recounting their mis- 
fortunes. On the contrary, whatever has a 
tendency to cheer the mind, and to divert it 
from disagreeable objects, ought to be in- 
stantly resorted to. , 

Though it certainly is not in our pbwer 
to avert grief, from which even sages and 
heroes are not exempt, yet we can do much 
to alleviate it, by denying ourselves the en- 
joyment which this indulgence in certain si- 
tuations afibrd. 

With frequent returns of grief^ the mind 
at length is constantly employed in con- 



001 



templating its wretched situation, so that it 
£nds new food for it in almost every object 
it beholds ; the deepest melancholy follows, 
and not unfrequently terminates in what is 
jcaWed a broken heart. 

In despair, we see no comfort in futurity, 
and our ideas of approaching misery become 
so intolerable, that we think ourselves in- 
capable of sustaining it^ and seek a remedy 
in death. 

. Hjqpochondriasis, habitual dejection, hys- 
terical affections, &c. may arise from a va- 
riety of physical causes ; but they are as 
frequently generated • in individuals other- 
Wise healthy, by the passions or the suffer- 
ings of the mind alone. 



With regard to sleep, I may remark, that sic«p. 
\o continue awake beyond a proper time 
consumes the vital spirits^ and vertigo, vio- 
lent head-ach and anxiety, are the conse* 
quences. It changes the temper and men- 
tal disposition of the most mild and gentle^ 
occasioning the most singular and ridiculpuf 
whims.

Sect. L— Q/* Contagiany Infection, de^ 

Deanition, Tqb various and vague application of th^ 
term contagion has been the source of much 
confiision. It has sometimes been used^ in 
foreign languages fis well as our own, for the 
plague itself; . sometimes as synonymous 
with infection; sometimes for the virulent 
effluvia issuing from the sick, or from sub- 
stances infected ; and sometimes merely as 
a property common to various diseases. It 



305 



is in the last of these senses that I under- 
stand it, and infection I understand to be its 
result. 

Contagious diseases have been divided 
into two classes : Those of the first are 
termed specific contagious, and attack per- 
sons only once during hfe ; such are the 
small-pox, the measles and scarlet- fever. 
These diseases are commonly said not to be 
generated by any process of nature with 
which we are acquainted, but always to be 
propagated by a previously subsisting con- 
tagion. Hence, therefore, it would follow, 
that if they were expelled from a kingdom, 
and their introduction prevented, they would 
not again exist in it. 

Those of the second class are termed ge- 
neral contagious, and seize persons oftener 
than once ; such are the fevers variously 
termed low, nervous, putrid, malignant, jail, 
hospital, &c., which, in various degrees of 
malignity, prevail chiefly in the habitations 
of the poor. These are allowed to require 
no subsisting contagion for their propaga- 
tion, because the infection is generated 
wherever a number of persons is lodged to- 
gether in a close, dirty, damp and ill-venti- 
lated place ; and its influence is increased 
by whatever produces debility of mind or of 
body. These contagions at least, there- 



fore^ thdughi estittgafohed, will W ealfAy 

sloth and inattention to cleanliness^- bd' 
nbt obviated tmonj^ the lower tvd&S^ of so- 
ciety. 

The distinction which* I hav=e iio«h d^stSlQ^ 
ed bears with it sdme plausibil^yy but tihie 
seqtiel will>. i tihink^ rather lead u^ Uy ooh- 
clude^. that these diseases are generMed'cMfi^ 
gidally wherevet certain causes etsisU 

There is^ however, another dist%f)(^tioB[ 
which w« may eoriskler as bdng niorejtistly' 
established^ nanFiely, betw^ea diseases' that 
proceed from cettisiih emanations dispersed' 
thi^gh the atmosphere, and which are 
termed epidemic, because ttiey attack the^ 
multitude who* receive their impressiOfi, ai^d 
those that are contracted by immediate cbn-« 
tact only with a inatt€$r also frequently invi^ 
sibli&y but more fixed, and sometimes by the 
inoculation of the morbific virus;- K must 
at once be ackno ' ledjgred) that the first are 
the most habitually prevalent, themodt'dif-r 
ficult to guard against, and those witli re^ 
spect to which the necessity of preserva- 
tives, and anti-contagious I'emediesy is chief- 
ly felt* Now, in this cla^ are ranked the 
hospital, jail and ship fevers, tiiat which is 
caught in the vicinity of mantes, atid^ in 



aoTT 



sltort^ all- trhe maligtiaiit fevers whttib owi^r 
their existence! to putrid exhalations. 

While nuitiewus other subjects of science' l^* Nttwe 
have been^ making rapid progress toward imi- 
pfovementy contagion seems to have conti- 
nued a subject entirely of guess — a di*ead- 
fal somewhat^ whose exact origiif! was uii- 
knbwnty. amd whose operation seetned ca^ 
pricious' afid< unaccountattle.' To* Whatever 
side erf" the question hoWever physicians have 
attached thiemrselvesv whether as contagion^- 
ists or anti-contagionists^ as they call tbem<- 
sehres^^ all of them agree that diseases of vari- 
o»s» kinds' are produced- by obstructed ven- 
tilation, nastiness, Sec. in alV the various forms 
in which they appear. The only iinportant 
difierence which seems to bewilder aii pav^' 
tieSf^ is;^ Whether epidemic diseates^arfe. caus^* 
ed by some material emanation difFus^d 
through the atmosphere^ and existing there 
h^ cert^ laws peculiar to itselfy or by some 
iiha^nary iiidefinoble sottiethitig, which 
must forever elude the most minute investi- 
gation. 

We may perhaps with propriety say of 
these violent disputants^ as Mr Boyle said of 
the school philosophers and the vulgaii, as he 
called them, ^' that, in considering the more 
obstiruse operations and phenomena of nd« 
ture^ they are' woi^t to' ruti into extrenied^

which^ though opposite to one another^ do 
almost equally contribute to keep men ig- 
norant of the true causes of those efTectsr 
they admire. They have recourse to agents 
that are not only invisible^ but inconceiv- 
able;* 

To whatever side we may attach ourselves i 
on this subject, we usually find, that the ad- 
vocates for both, however plausible their 
reasons may be, yet their objections to their 
adversaries are much stronger than their 
arguments for themselves. 

To adopt any imaginary principle to ex- 
' plain an effect, when by certain combinations 
' of matter, with the nature of which we are 
tolerably well acquainted, we can produce 
the phenomena we are in search of, seems 
to me at least unnecessary. Why thus at- 
tach ourselves to undefinable agents for ex- 
planations, when we can more satisfactorily 
account for the phenomena by the action of 
matter itself? The beauty,, uniformity and 
simplicity of the operations of nature are un- 
seen by us, and we force ourselves into the 
conviction, that these must be performed m 
the most complicated and unaccountable 
way. It is undoubtedly owing to this fro^ 
wardness of disposition alone, combined with 
a .certain degree of fancy, that we are in- ' 
debted for many of those hypothetical doo* 



aop 



trines, by which the most simple diseases of 
the human frame are rendered complex ; and 
the lives of millions sacrificed according to 
the supposed eminence and extensive oppor- 
tunity of him who uses them. 

Nothing indeed c^n give us so just a no- 
tion of contagion, and more clearly repre- 
sent the manner by which it produces infec- 
tion, thati odoriferous bodies. Some of these 
etritLingly revive the animal spirits ; others 
instantly depress and sink them ; we may 
therefore conceive, that whatever active par- 
ticles emitted from any such substances do, 
is in the like way done by pestiferous bodies ; 
so that infection is no more tlian the effect 
of volatile elusive matter drawn into the 
body% 

The proofs of the existence of a peculiar 
matter^ as being the cause of epidemic dis- 
eases, are as follows : 

1. It has been ascertained, that no change 
of the ordinary, physical, or chemical proper- 
ties of the atmosphere takes place in coun- 
tries during the prevalence of pestilential 
diseases. 

2. The occurrence of epidemics is not al- 
ways prevented by the succession of seasons, 
nor by remarkable changes of the weather; 
the plague, influenza, and other epidemics, 
having been observed to prevail for years. 



210 



v^ithout suffering any abatement of their 

virulence. 

That contagious effluvia is a matter floats 
ingin the atmosphere, is also evident from Mr 
Boyle's experiments, as he proves, that every 
body, of every degree of temperature and densi- 
ty, emanates a part of itself into the surrounds 
ing atmosphere. That certain substances, how* 
ever, emanate in certain temperatures more 
than others, is likewise evident. The pesti* 
ferous matter, therefore, seems to be of that 
particular nature which emanates only, or at 
least in a greater degree, in warm climates^ 
or in warm weather of any climate rather 
than in cold. 

Whether these contagious particles exist 
in a simple or in a compound state, may be 
difficult exactly to ascertain ; but no doubt 
can be entertained ,of their reproductiye 
power, when we see the matter of small*pox^ 
or the bubo of one affected with the plague^ 
give birth ,to other germs of the same kind, 
capable of infecting thousands of indivi* 
duals. 

In considering the developement of coa-i 
tagious poisons, it must excite astonishment^ 
that a particle so small, as frequently to be 
invisible, should so rapidly derange all the 
functions of life in a person of the most rCH 
bust constitution. Should we not experience 



211 



the satne feeling on perceiving those inflam- 
mations without fire, those combustions 
without heat, those sudden instances of dis- 
organization, and all the phenomena pro- 
duced by the oxygenated ftiuriatic acid were 
we not acquainted with its composition, be- 
fore observing its effects ? And should we 
not conclude, that both operate on similar 
principles? . 

Contagions and poisons may in reality 
consist of the same materials, varying but 
in their proportions, or in some unimportant 
circumstance; and the virus of syphilis^ 
small- pox, atid measles^ and of the spider^ 
rattle- snake and other venomous creatures, 
as being all of animal production, may chief- 
ly consist of azote and oxygen, combined 
perhaps with some other ingredient : there is 
also high probablity that marsh-miasmata 
will be found little else than a similar com- 
pound. The ichor of cancer and other cor- 
roding ulcers is very probably pretty much of 
thcl same thing. . This idea at least seems to 
be countenanced by what we observe in the 
syphilitic virus^ which, when applied to a se- 
creting surface, causes gonorrhoea ; to a dry 
one, chancre ; to a glandular surface, bubo, 
&c. ; arid it iis probable, that a similar excit- 
ing cause may, by operating upon the con- 
ititution, in one way ptoduce coritinued, in 

• 2 



212 



another, remittent fevers, which in reality 
differ from each other less in their causes, 
than in the particular part of the body to 
which this cause is appHed. 

Mr Cruickshaiik tried to inoculate two 
subjects with a portion of the variolous virus, 
after mixing it with the oxygenated-muria- 
tic acid ; the insertion produced no effect, 
while the other portion communicated the 
variolous eruption. 

If we reflect for a moment, w6 shall be 
convinced, that a variety of different com- 
plaints, from the mildest febrile affection 46 
the most malignant ; likewise carbuncle^ 
buboes, and mortified extremities, all appar- 
ently arise from the same cause ; at least 
they occur within the same apartment, ia 
different individuals, and often more than 
one of these affections exist in the same in- 
dividual. Hence, I think, we have some 
reason to believe, that these different efi^ts 
rather arise from some peculiarity of con- 
stitution in different individuals, or inequali- 
ty of the parts with regard to their powers of 
resistinp: morbid action, than that the sole 
power occasioning these differences should 
rest with the external agent. 

It is therefore by no means improbable, 
that a very great proportion of the diseases 
of this, as well as ojf every other country 



213 



With which we are acquainted, may originate 
from one or nearly the same source, and 
that their varieties are only modifications of 
each other, or exhibit a diflference of ap- 
pearance, solely from some peculiarity in the 
constitutions of the persons who may be af- 
fected. 

. This method of considering contagion is 
entirely conformable to the simplicity of na- 
ture. The assignment of a multiplicity of 
causes, to account for particular phenomena^ 
always indicates want of knowledge. 

Disorders resembling the very worst forms itsPropa- 
of epidemics, have, however, frequently ap- ^^ °"' 
pleared, without the evident operation of one 
specific cause, but would at first sight seem 
to have been owing to the combined influ- 
ence of several agents, and to be afterwards 
propagated by the emanation of a peculiar 
matter, generated in the course of the dis- 
order. Doubtless, however, one peculiar 
matter was the result of all these combina- 
tions. In this way, fevers of the most malig- 
nant description are generated on ship-board, 
in jails, hospitals, besieged towns, and in eve- 
ry situation where people are much crowd- 
ed. They originate, in tlie first place, from 
noxious effluvia, and are subsequently pro- 
pagated by whatever causes debilitate indi- 
viduals. In such circumstances^ the effluvia 

o 3 



214 



continually rising from the bodies of men 
become accumulated, and consequently their 
constituent parts form new combinationg 
highly pernicious to health. 

From the above instances, it will be rea* 
dily understood, that the primary cause pf 
epidemical diseases is frequently confined 
to a limited space ; but it frequently hap- 
pens, that the distempers produced, gener-« 
rate in their course a matter which is capa- 
ble of propagating itself at some distance from 
the original source. This matter, though 
only evident to the senses, in a remarkable 
degree, by its pernicious efiects, is that of 
which the operation is known by the term 
contagion. 

Febrile contagion, in whatever way gene- 
rated, may be propagated either by actual 
contact with infected object?, or by breath- 
ing air charged with effluvia, whether pro- 
ceeding from substances imbued with con- 
tagious virus, or from patients labouring un- 
der pestilential disease. It has however been 
observed, that substances so imbued, im- 
part a more virulent contagion, than that 
arising from the effluvia of the sick. 

Owing to the closeneis of their pores, and 
to their density, stony and metallic matters 
are not well adapted for carrying off conta- 
gious effluvia. It is therefore evident^ that 



-zis 



the substances most likely to carry ofF these 
effluvia, are those of a loose texture, such 
as wool, cotton, &c. , 

In what relation the human body stands 
to effluvia of different kinds may be difficult 
to explain, as certain diseases affect it only, 
and no other animal that may come with- 
in the sphere of their action. No reason 
appears from comparative anatomy, why 
ibis peculiarity should exist, as anatomists 
and physiologists have not yet pointed out 
to us any peculiar properties or actions that 
our organs possess, which are not to be 
found in many other animals. 

It seems, that in these febrile contagions, 
the poison will be more or less mischievous 
as it happens to be more or less concentrat- 
ed ; a property that is not found in what 
have been called specific poisons, as that of 
small pox, the venereal disease, and others^ 

At a very early period, it was imagined 
that the air possessed a power of dissolving 
contagion, and thereby rendering it inert, 
Dr Haygarth has since revived this opinion* 
It may indeed be somewhat difficult to ascer- 
tain what may be the effect of the atmosphere 
m actuallydissolving effluvia of this nature, as 
much must depend on the existing state of 
^e atmosphere, as well as on some other 

4 



2l6 



concomitant circumstances. We know,; 
however, that infectious effluvia^ whether* 
issuing from the body of the patient, or from 
substances imbued with contagious matter^ 
or with morbid excretions, are rendered inert, 
and often, I believe^ harmless, ' by dilutioa 
with common ain The small-pox is harm- 
less at three feet distant from the patient. 

Under different circumstances, it has been 
found, that the air contributes in no small 
degree to the propagation of contagion, and 
that pestilential diseases never exercise sucti 
cruel ravages as when the constitution of the 
atmosphere is favourable to the developer 
ment of its poison. 

The contagion accompanying the disease,, 
and this disposition of the air to promote 
that contagion, ought to be equally consider- 
ed, both being necessary to give the disease 
full force. When, therefore, in a corrupt 
state of the air, the contagious particles meet 
with the subtile parts generated by that cor- 
ruption, by uniting with them, they become 
much more active and powerful, and like- 
wise of more durable nature ; so as to form 
an infectious matter capable of conveying 
the mischief to a greater distance from the 
diseased body. 
Prcdispo- I dare say it has been observed in every 
country, during the prevalence of any wide« 



siUon. 



217 



ly spreading disease, that although the health 
of the inhabitants was in general bad, yet 
the disease was usually accounted the cause 
of all their complaints, and they were all 
recognised under its name. This is a false 
mode of reasoning, and has been pro- 
ductive of *many serious mistakes. We 
know, for instance, that putrifying substan* 
ces of different kinds, produce disease 
among the inhabitants immediately contigu- 
ous to it, in consequence of the surrounding 
atmosphere being overcharged with the pu« 
trid effluvia arising from such sources ; and 
we likewise- know, that different individuaia 
differently situated, in a variety of ways, are 
differently affected by one cause, and thus 
from one source, various diseases may origi- 
nate. This seems owing to some peculiarity 
of the constitution of different individuals^ 
or an inequality of the parts with regard to 
their powers of resisting the influence of ex- 
ternal agents ; thus, the same influence of 
climate, &c., that in one person would ex- 
cite diarrhoea, pneumonia, rheumatism, &c.' 
will induce diseases of a completely different 
nature in others. 

If, then, it has been observed, that among 
men equally exposed to the plague, a small 
number do not contract it at all ; if, of two 
persons inoculated with the same variolous 



218 



matter^ the one.takes the small pox, and the 
other does not ; if, of several people bit, 
even until blood flows, by the same animal 
in the same paroxysm, none of them having 
applied any remedy, some c^ them are seiz- 
ed with hydrophobia, and others escape ; if 
it is sufficient for some to touch the cloth- 
ing of a person afiected with the itch, in or- 
der to contract the disorder, while others 
may with- impunity sleep in the same bed 
with him ; if some debauchees escape from 
repeated dangers which they set at defiance, 
while the greater number suffer for a single 
act of indiscretion, may we not reascmably 
presume, that those who escape dangers im- 
der which the' majority sink, possess a con* 
stitution peculiarly calculated to resist the 
influence of the disorders \vhich they 
escape ? 

Predisposition alone can cause these di^ 
ferences; the contagious miasmata remain 
the same, but they no longer make the same 
impression on our organs, and it is that de- 
rangement in the animal economy which ia 
caused by debilitating habits in general that 
produces what is called predisposition. This 
predisposition may exist very differently in 
different persons, apparently in other re- 
spects of equal health and strength ; upoa 
the same principle, that such persons equal<» 



ai9 



ly healthy are very differently affected by 
the use of intoxicating liquors. 

I shall have little difficulty in persuading 
my reader, that it is not a particular hu- 
mour, pre-exlstent * in a healthy subject, 
which either destroys or accelerates the ac- 
tion of the contagious poison, but that it is 
rather a state of debility, an incipient change 
of the body already approaching to disease, 
which renders some individuals more suscep- 
tible than others, of the impression of the 
contagious virus. 

* The immediate cause of agues, I may 
mention, is the soil and air of the place ; 
but the predisposing causes, or those which 
render the constitution subject to their at*- 
tacks, are many and various ; such as lying 
in damp rooms, in linen not sufficiently dry, 
or travelling in cold damp nights ; neglect- 
ing immediately to put on dry clothes after 
being wet by rain, or the like accidents. 
Irregularity in living is likewise a predispos* 
ing cause of disease. 

Medical writers, in assigning all these as 
predisposing causes, seem almost, or indeed 
entirely, to have neglected the effect of 
those changes and emotions which are con- 
tinually going forward in the animal ma- 
chine. These perhaps do not directly<:au8e 
disease of a very dangerous nature, but they 



320 

must be allowed to modify their violence ia 
a verv great degree. 

We are perhaps warranted in supposing^ 
that it princip*<lly depends on oar modes of 
living, &c We njust have observed, that 
people from certain habits have been subject 
to peculiar diseases even after they had re- 
moved from the country in which these ha- 
bits had been contracted. The sweating 
disease, for instance, which many years ago 
made its appearance in England, in the .Low 
Countries, and in France," attacked those 
people who had for sometime left their 
country to avoid its ravages, while it spared 
strangers who resided in England. The 
reason must have been, that the English^ 
on quitting their native country, carried 
with them their mode of Hving, and their 
habits. 
Manner in How does the poison gain admission into 
received, the body ? It may be by the lungs in re- 
spiration ; by the absorbing vessels of the 
skin ; or, by adhering to the fauces in respi- 
ration : it may even be swallowed by whatever 
is carried into the stomach. All these, as well 
as the impressions on the nerves, have had 
their abettors, as being the organs through 
which contagion is communicated to th^ 
circulating fluids. 



221 



It has been argued iri favour of this being 
^effected by means of cuticular absorption^ 
that though water will not pass through 
WaHders, at least for some time, yet it has 
been tound, that venous blood acquired the 
.colour of arterial blood from oxygen gas, as 
readily when these substances were separat- 
ed by a bladder, as when they were in actual 
contact If it can pervade them, why may 
it not also pervade the cuticle ? Nay, fur- 
ther, we know, from the experiments of Mr 
Cruickshanks, that the vapour perspired 
passes through leather, even when prepared 
so as to keep out moisture, at least for a 
certain time. It is possible, then, that wa- 
ter> when in a state of vapour, or when dis- 
solved in air, may be absorbed, although 
water may be incapable of pervading the 
cuticle. The experiments, therefore, which 
have hitherto been made upon the absorp- 
tion of the skin, are insufficient to prove 
that air and vapour cannot pervade the cuti- 
cle^ provided there be any facts, which there 
certainly are, to render the contrary suppo- 
sition probable. 

The manner in which contagious effluvia Its Mode 

of Action. 

acts on the body seems, at present, to be 
entirely built on the most vague and unsa- 
tisfactory reasoning. We may, however, 
hope, that experience and mvestigation will 



232 



yet throw some light on thid. We tnay 
at present remarlc^ that an inconceivably 
small quantity of matter introduced into th6 
circulation of the bloody can^ as in the ino-» 
culation for the small pox, experiments with 
poisons, &c. act with wonderful efficacy. 
It would appear, therefore, that all these 
poisons, with many others, when introduced 
into the body, act only by changing the na- 
tural mode of operation of the vital powers. 
If they be absorbed, which is probable, they 
are modified and mitigated in the act of ab^ 
sorption, by mixing with other fluids^ Still, 
however, even this does not explain its mod6 
of action. Priestley and Cavendish found, 
that air might be rendered infectious with- 
out its deleterious qualities being discovera- 
ble by eudiometric tests. 



Sect. II. — Of Individual Diseases. 

Inflamma- As much has been said in the preceding 
tion, pages respecting the various circumstance* 

connected with particular diseases, it will 
only be necessary that I should give the fol- 
lowing rapid sketch of some of the most 
important diseases resulting ffomiocalcflusesr. 
Inflammation, all its modifications, and aff 
Its consequences, may, in this hasty sketefa> 



223 



be first considered^ because they depend up« 
on the derangement of some of those gene- 
ral causes which we first described, namely, 
those of climate, and on cold in particular* 

Inflammatory disorders are most common 
when the sky is clear, and the barometer 
high with cold winds. And those most lia- 
ble to be affected by them are such as are ia 
the bloom and vigour of life, and who live 
in high and dry countries ; those also of full 
rigid fibres, and it is always increased by ton- 
ic and stimulant powers applied to the body. 

Inflammation is caused by burning, wound- 
ing, bruising, compressing, or over-stretch- 
ing the parts, by the application of a certain 
degree of cold, or by substances taken into 
the body. When slight, it is preceded by a 
sense of weight and oppression, and, for 
some days, by a kind of anxiety before fever 
is superadded. 

Every considerable inflammation of any 
part is introduced by cold shivering, and it 
consists in an increased flow of blood into 
the affected part. 

All inflammations are acute and passive ; 
the first are those which run their course 
rapidly, the other those which continue long^ ' 
and, as it were, become habitual to the part.. 

In every inflamm^d part there is a conges- 
tion of bloody and a distention of vessels, in 



224 

a greater or less degree. The soft partir 
when affected by it swell most ; the hard 
least. 

In the first stage of inflammation, the pa- 
tient feels weak and languid^ complains of 
coldness, his pulse' is frequent and small^ 
there is thirst, the tongue is parched, the 
head confused or pained, and the functions 
of the stomach deranged. 

In general, the pulse is smaller and hard^ 
er in inflammation, in proportion as the sys- 
tem is affected. In inflammation of the 
lungs, except in robust and plethoric per- 
sons, the pulse is seldom full. In cuticular 
inflammation, however, the pulse is fuller^ 
but proportionally slower. 

In external inflammation, there is red- 
ness, heat, pain, tension, and, when exten« 
sive, there is present some degree of fever. 
When it affects tlie internal parts, there is 
fever, a fixed pain in the part, with some in- 
terruption in the exercise of its function, 
and blood drawn exhibits, on cooling, a yel- 
lowish gluten on its surface. 

Inflamf nation of parts, whose action is 
low, such as the ligaments, tendons, or 
bones, are extremely painful, and affect the 
system violertly 

The action of inflammation has a tenden- 



223 



cy to conlinue for some time after its c£iuse 
is withdrawn. 

The most common terminations of in« 
flammation are resolution^ suppuration^ and 
gangrene. The first is when by blood 
drawn from the part, or by any other 
means, the cure is effected without the 
destruction of the affected part.' The se- 
cond is, when effusion of matter called pust 
is formed in the part, while the redness^ 
heat, pain, and distention abate, and cold shi- 
tering is felt, with a throbbing sensation in 
the part. The pulse also becomes fuller 
and softer, and fluctuation is felt in the part 
which constitutes an abscess, which being 
opened is an ulcer. The third is preceded 
by extreme pain and heat in the part, with 
smart fever. It becomes of a dark red cb- 
lour, blisters appear on it^ and the pain al- 
most entirely ceases. The part next be- 
comes soft, flaccid, insensible ; then livid} 
at length black ; it loses its heat and con- 
sistence, and exhales a cadaverous smell. * 

If the pain, redness, and heat continue, 
the part becomes pulsatory, soft^ and fluc- 
tuating, with chillness ; the .structure of the 
part is destroyed, and this termination is 
called suppuration. Too great a degree of 
inflammatory action, as well as too little^ 
equally retards the suppurative pr6c«ss; 



226 



Any snrtsLce in this state of infbmmfltiOD 
produces pus, but that state being altered^ 
pus is not formed ; it then discharges mat- 
ter totally different in its properties. 

The consequences of inflammation ans 
schirros^ dropsy, adbesion^ suppuratioii^ and 
gangrene. 

When the pain, heat, and redness disap- 
pear, and the swelling reiftains^ it is said ta 
end in schirrus, which liappens most fm* 
quently in the glands. 

W hen ' the inflammation is veVy riolen^ 
showing no tendency to any of these tennis. 
nations, we have reason to fear mortificatiooy 
particularly if the part becomes acutely paio^ 
fuiand livid, and the part loses its heat, the 
pulses becomes frequent and fiseble^and great 
diminution of strength occurs. 

When gangrene has taken pbce, it mutf 
be separated from the tiving parts, by deep 
scarification with the knife, or, by inducii^ 
inflammatory action, in its ndgbbourhooil 
it may drop ofi^. 

The efl^ects of mortification on the gene- 
ral systeih are, feebleness -of pulse, uansiMA 
weakness, thirst, squeamishness, foal tongue^ 
and the teeth covered with sordea; the 
eye languid, and the features sharp and 
anxious. Before death« the larine tfid stoeis 
come away invduntarily^ and tbe fatievt 



%vi 



iiecomes comatose ; the ^excretions become 
fcetid^ sloughs are formed where pressure 
operates^ the contractile power of the arte* 
lies ceases^ and the pulse rolls or moves, but 
does not beat. 

From a weak slow pulse, we may infer^ 
that the general action of the system is 
much diminished ; and when considerabLs 
intervals between the feeble contractions of 
the he^rt take place, death is not far dis- 
Upt. 



t--S9tf! 



Catarrh is properly an afTection of the ciurrhi 
mucous glands of the trachea and bronchiae, 
and is of two kinds, the acute and the 
chronic. 

Catarrh begins with sneezing, difficulty 
of breathing through the nose^ which soon 
after discharges thin acrid matter, corroding 
the parts over which it passes;, there is 
likewise a dull pain, or rather weight, about 
the head, slight fever, with swelling and 
stiffness of the eyes. Tenderness, or rather 
pain is felt on inspiration, with cough. 
There is rawness or soreness in the tlirpat, 
with loss of taste and smell, and a tight- 
iwss in the. chest, with some difficulty of 
tea»thing. 

P2 



7,2B 



The cough is at first dry, occasioning 
great pains in the chest, and the pulse to- 
iivard evening is more frequent than usual. 

There is difficulty of breathing, particu- 
larly in the morning : the patient attempts 
fo relieve it by coughing, which, on ex- 
pectoration becoming free, is relieved, 
and temporary ease is obtained. Dur- 
ing the day the cough is teazing, though 
' not distressing ; but while in bed, the usual 
exertions not being made to relieve it, the 
mucus accumulates, and the breathing be- 
comes obstructed, which increases, till the 
lungs are divested of this load by expectCMra- 
tion. 

Next morning, the same symptoms again 
seize the at length enfeebled patient, and 
thus any little strength he may possess to 
Support him through the fatigues of the day, 
is nearly exhausted. 

As the disease advances, expectoration 
becomes excessively difficult, and the accu- 
mulation of mucus impedes respiration. In 
general, however, the fever ceases^ the 
cough is less violent, the expectoration be- 
' comes more copious, and the disease disap- 
pears, leaving an eruption about the lips and 
nose. 

There is a species of chronic catarrh very 
common in our island, which generid^ 



329 

seizes enfeebled people advanced in life. 
From frequent repetition of catarrhal affec- 
tion, and perhaps from some other causes^ 
they become habitually affected with a sort 
of chronic cough, often continuing to harass 
them for many years, and proving extreme- 
ly distressing. In some cases, it goes off in 
j9ummer, and returns in winter. 

When the complaint is protracted, or ocf 
curs in old people who are much exhausted 
Jby other diseases, or enfeebled by old age, 
the expectoration ceases, whilst the bron- 
chial secretion goes on ; the patient becomes 
drowsy ; the skin becomes cold ; the pulse 
small and fluttering ; the face is tumified 
and discoloured ; the lips are livid ; the 
breathing becomes more and more difEcult ; 
till at last the bronchias are so replete with 
mucus, that the admission of a sufficient 
quantity of air to support life becomes im- 
pos3ible, and the patien.t dies suffocated. 



t 



By the term pneumonia, we understand Pneumonia 
an inflammation of the lungs, or of the sur- 
rounding viscera. It is known by the pre- 
j^ence of fever, difficult breathing, particu- 
larly on inspiration, and cough, with pain ip ' 
some part of the thorax. 

P3 



230 

tt is most common in the robust and full 
habit, particularly from the age of forty-five 
to sixty years. 

This disease may be caused by cold appli- 
ed to the surface of the body^ and obstruct- 
ing perspiration. It is most common whefi 
an inflammatory diathesis prevails in the sys- 
tem, and during sudden and violent changes 
of the weather. 

The pain is often felt under the sternum, 
tometimes in the back between the shouL* 
ders, or near the middle of the sixth or se- 
venth ribs. It is sometimes severe, at other 
times heavy and obtuse^ and is much in- 
creased when the patient coughs. 

Violent fever, with acute pain interrupt* 
ing inspiration, is always a mark of a violent 
state of that disease ; and during this vio- 
lence, the pulse is frequent, full, atrongjt 
hard, and quick ; but, in the advanced sta» 
ges,* it is often weak, soft, and irregular. 

This disease is always most dangerous 
when there is violent and frequent dry 
cough, knd great difficulty of breathing ; 
when the patient can only lie on his back^ 
or in somewhat of an erect posture ; when 
the pain spreads ; and when flushing of the 
face, irregularity of the pulse, and delirium 
occur. 



I ' 



231 



Pneumonic inflammation most common- 
ly proves fatal by an effusion of blood or 
matter into the cellular texture of the lungs^ 
by which they are compressed, the circula- " 
tion is stopt, and a fatal suffocation is indu<* 
Ced. When it thus proves fatal^ it is almost 
always within the first week. 

Pneumonia may terminate by resolution, 
wppuration and gangrene. 

This disease may be protracted (ox a week, 
land terminate in resolution ; but if^ it be 
protracted a fortnight, this seldom happens. 
When this disease thus terminates by reso» 
lution, it is commonly accompanied by some 
evacuation of blood from the nose, &c. Re- 
(solution is most common when there is co* 
pious expectoration of yellowish, though 
Dot purulent, matter^ without much cough«* 
ing, or a copious sweat over the body. The 
pulse then abates in frequency, and the heat 
of the body, with the other febrile symptoms, 
disappears. 

Slight cold shiverings announce the sup- 
purative process ; the pulse is in general 
softer, the pain subsides, the cough and 
dyspnoea increase, and the more frequent 
end hectic puUe is at length formed. 

Pneumonic inflammation often produces 
an exudation from the surface of the bron- 

P4 



232 



chise^ pleura and pericardiam^ which are 
Jfound after death. 

Peripneumony is most common in spring 
and autumn^ and when the weather changes 
from hot to cold. 

This disease ' attacks persons somewhat 
advanced in life, of a full phlegmatic habit^ 
and who h^ve been addicted to the^large 
use of fermented and spirituous liquors. 
Adults are the subjects of its attack^ as it 
scarcely ever afiects children. 

Intemperance in drinking spirits^ exer* 
tion^ speaking in public, or blowing a musi*' 
cal instrument, will induce it. 

It begins with alternate chills and heats, 
slight cough, some expectoration, with fre- 
quent vomiting of opaque mucus. The 
cough becomes frequent and violent, the 
headach distressing, the face flushed, with 
giddiness or drowsiness. There is difficult 
and oppressive breathing, with a sense oi 
tightness in the chest, attended by obscure 
pains there, and a sense of lassitude all over 
the body. The urine is very turbid, an4 
blood drawn exhibits the huify coat pn its 
surface. 

■ 

Though the feyerish and catarrhal symp- 
toms are at first slight they suddenly be- 
come considerable, and often unexpectedly 
put an end to the patient's life.

Sometimes its termination is suddenly fa« 
tal, at other times the disorder continues a 
fortnight^ and goes off. When the expec- 
toration begins and then stops, it generally 
terminates fatally. Flushing of the face is 
one of the worst symptoms, and when the 
face and lips grow livid, all hopes of recove* 
ly are at an end. 

In peripneumony the pulse is often so 
low before death that it can scarcely be 
felt. 



By the term phthisis pulmonalis, we un- i^hthisii 
derstand an affection of the lungs always ^"^ot^Cm. 
preceded by inflammation, more or less sumption. 
perceptible, leading in general to an expec- 
toration of purulent matter, and being at- 
tended by hectic fever. 

Consumption seems a disease of much 
greater frequency in large crowded cities 
than in villages, or in free country air, and 
is most common inthe vigour of life. Those 
also most subject to this complaint, are such 
as have been born of consumptive or of scro- 
fulous parents. 

The most frequent cause of phthisis is the 
!existence of tubercles in the lungs, which 
at length inflamis, break, and pour out their 



234 



mdtter into the Broncbise. Asthma^ atso, 
may occasion this disease, by producing tu- 
bercles. An accidental catarrh may even 
occasion the inflammation of tubercles al«- 
ready formed, and produce consumption. 

In this country, the disease is tedious^ 
most severe during wiater and spring, some- 
tirnes almost entirely disappeanng during 
the summer, and of those who are affected 
by it, the greater number die. It is often 
very quickly fatal in its effects, at other 
times very tedious, often twenty, fifty, or 
more years. 

A shortness of breath, and a quick pulse, 
are two of the most dangerous signs of a 
suspected phthisis. Attention ought also to 
be paid to catarrh of long standing in phthi- 
sical persons, . as both diseases, in their ht^ 
ginning, are very similar in appearance. 

In persons predisposed toi phthisis, a ca« 
tarrh is also often the beginning of that dis- 
ease, so that the diagnosis is ofte^ peculiar- 
ly dilEcult. Spitting of blood also ofteq 
precedes and accompanies the disease. 

In the commencement of phthisis there isi 
felt in the chest a degree of tension, with slight 
dry cough. When it arises from tubercles, i| 
usually commences with slight short cougb^ 
the breathing is hurried, the patient becomes 



335 



languid and indolent, and the body becomefe 
leaner. These symptoms advance slowly, 
often occupying a year or two before they 
become alarming. 

At first the cough is attended with little 
expectoration, which however increases as 
the disease advances^ This cough of phthi* 
sical persons is particularly troublesome to 
them on their lying down at night. It often 
idso ceases, and, after an uncertain lengdi 
of time, returns accoippanied by other sym^ 
tomisi. 

Even before the disease has far advanced, 
there is a paleness and sharpness of the fea- 
tured, with occasional circumscribed flush- 
ing of the cheeks, pains are then also felt in 
the thorax, and the patient experiences some 
difRculty in making a full inspiration. The 
tongue, likewise, is foul, but, as the disease 
advances, the inner surface of the mouth and 
fauces become red. The urine too, is high 
coloured from the commencement of the 
disease ; and costiveness is also almost air- 
ways present at the same time. 

It is remarkable that, during pregnancy, 
and nursing, the disease seems to m^e least 
progress, but afterward hastens to a rapid 
termination. 

As the disease advances, there are frequent 
cold shiverings^ which are succeeded by great 



236 



heat, with copious expectoration, and even 
vomiting of puriform matter. The pulse 
now intermits, the breath is ofiensive^'and 
expectoration difficult, the pulse easily ac- 
celerated, breathing while asleep is laborious^ 
and the patient wakes unrefreshed. 

We may know whether the matter expec- 
torated is. pus or mucus, by dissolving it in 
sulphuric acid, and then adding to it some 
water. If it be mucus, the matter is separate 

• ed, and floats in, or swims on the surface; 
but if pus, the separated matter falls to the 
bottom of thjS vessel. The same phenome- 
non happens when these matters are dissolv* 
ed in fixed alkali. Mucus also is tough and 
naturally transparent, pus is always opake 
and, as it were more friable^ mucus when 
thrown into water, remains united in circu- 
lar masses, pus^ by slight agitation, is brok- 
en into^ragments. Mucus is much more 
inodorous than pus. It also swims in water, 
while pus sinks in it ; in this, however, much 
depends on the air they contain. 

The symptoms of hectic fever, the geu$« 
ral attendant of consumption, are, alternate 
chills and flushes, frequent small pulse, loss 

. of appetite, thirst, diarrhoea, pale urine, colli- 
quative sweats during the night, emaciatiotn 
pf the body, great weakness, an4 before 



237 



death, a red circumscribed flush upon the 
cheeks. . 

Hectic fever has also an exacerbation 
about noon, and in the evening, attended 
with some degree of cold shivering, although 
the skin is preternaturally warm. Sweating 
at length accompanies the evening exacer* 
bation, and continues more or less profusely 
during the whole course of the disease. 

In hectic, the appetite for food is less im- 
paired than in any other fever. The thirst is 
seldom great, the mouth is moist, the tongue 
clean, and at length it is more or less covered 
with aphthae, the eye is of a dull pearly white, 
the face, except during the exacerbations, is 
•pale and ghastly, and great debility prevails. 
In the early stages, costiveness also prevails ; 
but at length, occurs a diarrhoea, which alter- 
nates with sweatings. Emaciation proceedfil^ 
the hair falls out, and the nails are incurvated. 

As the cough, expectoration, and hectic 
fever increase, pains are felt in the thorax^ 
under the sternum, and sometimes in the 
side. On lying on one or other side, the 
pain and coughing are increased. A dis- 
agreeable burning heat is also often felt in 
the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. 
Haemoptysis sometimes accompanies, but is 
as frequently absent during this disease. 

When the disease has advanced /ar^ the 



98d 

patient sinks fastest during the warm 
months. 

Diarrhoea often occurs in the last stage^ 
sweatings^ when it is stopt^ break out, and 
when it continues, the sweats disappear* 
Petechias also late in the disease break out 
over the body, which becomes ulcerated 
from lying on it. The extremities tumify^ 
the mind is incoherent, the body shrinks 
in all its dimensions, the eyes are sunk and 
dull, the lips ding close to the teeth, and the 
gums are shrivelled. 

Before death, all pain and uneasiness ent- 
irely cease, the patient entertains hopes of 
recovery ; but the supervention of hiccough 
and inability to perform any voluntary mo^ 
tion undeceive him ; the heart palpitates, and 
flutters, the voice changes, and deglutitioa 
is extremely difficult. Wild delirium ensues, 
the eyes sink, the features collapse and be- 
come dead)} pale ; and often, amidst the most 
distressing strjuggles, the patient expires* 



Hydrocc- In every period of the history of our pro- 

Watcr*b fession, too little attention has been paid to

giTtn to thMi ; in other instances, they are 
almost completely neglected* Were they, 
however, to be made a subject of more gene- 
cd enquiiy, medical science would be greatly 
benefited* 

Among in&nts, hydrocephalus internnsy 
or water in the head, is a very common dis^ 
ease ; perhaps, however, not more so tfaaoi 
formerly ; for it only appears more frequent 
because we can now recognise and trace the 
^mptoms from their origin, and our know* 
ledge of its real nature is consequently more 
Bccurate than we could expect it to be ifi for- 
mer times, when it could scarcely ever be said 
to exist till^ when after death, the cruiium 
^as opened^ and water was found within the 
mentricles of the brain. . 

The stcMit uid healthy are more assailable 
by this disease than those of a more weakly 
habit of body, unless indeed the debility of 
exhaustion be extremely greaL 

The disease consists of two stages, the 
£rst, that of inflammation, the second, that 
of effusion, and it may consequently be clas* 
sed as a disease of either of these kinds. 

Writers on it have been in the habit of 
erroneously preferring to class \t among drop- 
sies ; and, the remedies which such a state 
suggested always proving unsuccessful, it 
lias long been deemed incurable.

In a periodical medical publication^ I late- 
ly stated my opinion, that, in a practical 
point of view, it ought to be considered pure- 
ly as an inflammatory disease ; for though 
effusion of water into the ventricles of the 
' brain be the sequel of this state, and be in- 
deed that from which the disease derives its 
name, (a striking proof of the danger of in- 
correct names,) yet it is not to this state that 
the practitioner is to turn his attention ; but 
solely to the preceding inflammatory one^ 
and the disease may therefore be termed ant 
inflammatory disease ; that name alone indi- 
. eating the remedies to be adopted. That, 
however, although chiefly considered as a 
dropsy, such remedies have been applied is 
unquestionable ; but the fact that these reme- 
dies never were applied, either early enough 
or extensively enough, sufl[iciently proves, 
that the most correct notion of its nature 
was by no means entertained. Hence it-^ was 
treated in the «tage of effusion instead of 
that inflammation, — a stage in which att 
the remedies known to us are certainly 
vain ♦. 






* This is the amount of what I have to state re* 
specting the naiure of this disease, and I must 
therefore beg, that the quackish advertisements of

Thus, the first principle adopted by au- 
thors respecting the nature of this disease 
being fundamentally wrong, all the reason- 
ings which sprung from it have likewise been 
wrong ; and, in this way, we may easily ac- 
count for the uniform want of success which 
attended their practice^ 



^- 



a modem author, well known for plagiarism, that 
the disease is perfecdy remediable without any dis- 
tinction of stages, may by no means, although 
founded on the presumption of the correctness of my 
doctrine respecting the disease, be imputed to me. 
As this person, by a publication on this subject, 
is likely again f to expose himself to the ridicule 
of every well informed Yeviewer, I must also beg that 
his trash may not be imputed to me, excepting in 
so far as he may adopt the principle I have here 
delivered, which is rather an attempt toward a dif- 
ferent classification of the disease and the introduc- 
tion of a more speedy and effectual practice, than 
toward any original discovery. It is deeply to be 
regretted, that the institution of a police for the 
purpose of preventing the world from being trou- 
bled with idle and mangled plagiarism is probably 
inconsistent with the general liberties of the sub- 
ject.

It has long been asserted, and very gene- 
rally believed, that this disease was sudden 
in its attack and uniformly fatal in its conse- , 
quences. 

The disease is never sudden in its attack, 
nor always fatal in its consequences; but I 
believe, th?it when effusion into the ventri- 
cles of the brain has taken place, the con- 
sequence must be fatal. 

Its attacking infants in preference to 
adults, might be explained. We know that 
such is the particular state of the body in 
children, that the propelling and resisting 
powers have not acquired that degree of in- 
dependence of each other, which they pos- 
sess in after life, so that their diseases are 
totally different from those of adults ; for, 
from this state of the body, any disease, 
wherever situated, will, either primarily or 
ultimately affect the most delicately organis- 
ed and tender parts, in preterence to any 
other, ' 

Til us, by not understanding the real na- 
ture of this disease ; and, like true medcial 
men, r.ever at a loss for an explanation, we 
find that a variety of absurd names have 
been applied by practitioners to the different 
stages of it ; such as the spaining brash, the 
bowel hivCi draughts, milk fever j commlsions, 
&c« i and each of these have had their m« 



248 



dividual modes of treatment, which have 
been often hurtful, but seldom, if ever, bene-^ 
ficial. Syrups, small doses of opium, with a 
multitude of quack drugs, have occasional- 
ly been given for the removal of these com- 
plaints, and sometimes they have even ven- 
tured to apply a small blister between the 
shoulders, on the breast or the temples. 

Some time ago, I visited a child along 
with a physician of this city, who has been 
long in practice, and who has been in the ha- 
bit of seeing a very great number of the dis- 
eases of children. The child's pulse was 
150 per minute, and strong ; and I mention- 
ed this circumstance to-^him ; but, to my 
astonishment, he remarked, that he paid no 
attention to the pulses of children, as from 
them .he never had been able to form any 
correct opinion respecting their complaints. 

He believed, that the state of the pulse, 
in the present instance, was owing to a state 
of irritation produced by what he termed 
the milk fever, (the child had been weaned 
about a week before,) and f6r the removal 
of this he prescribed syrup of poppies. The 
symptoms were aggravated, the child shriek- 
ed incessantly, and, at the expiration of two 
days, the pulse was still full, and beat 170 
per minute. The physician had not been 
very regular in his attendance, and I stated 

a 2 



i 



24A 



to the father my conjectures respecting the 
nature of the complaint, and advised a cap 
blister to be instantly applied over the wholel 
head, and the bowels to be freely opened 
with purgative medicines. These means 
were applied, and in the course of the fol- 
lowing day, the child ceased to scream, the 
pulse fell to 120, and, in one day more, it 
was only 100. At the pressing request of 
the mother^ the blister was allowed to heal^ 
and in the course of a few days, all the for- 
mer symptoms recurred. The blister was 
again applied, and they were again relieved^ 
For several weeks after, it was also found ne- 
cessary to apply the blister several times, and^ 
as the bowels remained torpid, they were 
opened by calomel and jallap. This cade 
occurred more than a year ago, and the child 
is now perfectly well. 

Lately I attended another case of the same 
kind in conjunction with the same physician. 
I advised a similar treatment ; but it was not 
followed. He prescribed Dalby^s carmina* 
live ! ! ! with an advice to trust to the oper- 
ation of nature. No blister was applied till 
the last day of the child's life, ami nature 
had time to operate ; for effusion had taken 
plai e, and the child soon died . fter deaths 
I oprned tlie head, in company with two 
medical gentlemen^ and all my conjectures 



245 



were verified ; not only were the ventricles 
filled with water ; but the whole brain was 
almost semi-transparent from the quantity 
of water which it contained. 

In by far the greater proportion of cases 
of this disease, perhaps in ten out of twelve, 
the most acute inflammatory state of the 
system prevails for a longer or shorter time 
previous to the effusion of water into the 
ventricles, according to the peculiarity of 
constitution of the individual affected. 
The symptoms of this disease, as they 
most commonly occur, sometimes commence 
several weeks, but most commonly from 
ten to twenty days previous to the effusion 
of fluid in the ventricles. Even weeks be- 
fore inflammatory action has been indicat- 
ed by the pulse in those children who 
have afterward died of this disease, I have 
Dbserved them suddenly cling their arms 
about their nurse, as if afraid of falling from 
her arms, and from time to time without 
'any evident cause scream, as if suffering the 
most acute pain. 

This disease may however be induced with- 
out any remarkable degreeof previous inflam- 
matory action. In extreme debility, pa;-ticu- 
larly among children, the vessels of the brain, 
in common with thqse of the body in general, 
become greatly relaxed ; and, in this state, 

as

246 

effusion into the ventricles takes place. 
Under these circumstances, it may be diffi- 
cult to ascertain the moment when the ef- 
fusion does take place, as no remarkable phe- 
nomenon occurs by which we can be guid- 
ed in our conjectures upon the subject. 

In those, however, who die of this disease^ 
from previous inflammatory action of the 
system, the time when the effusion of fluid 
into the ventricles of the brain takes place, 
may be more easily known. The quick, 
full, inflammatory pulse, which had existed 
for sometime previously, is suddenly dimin- 
ished, both in its frequency and fullness^ 
and every symptom of disease which before 
existed, seems entirely to abate ; so much 
so, that I used to be at first deceived into 
the belief that the child was in a fair way of 
recovery. This state, however, seldom con- 
tinues beyond a few hours, when the child 
is suddenly seized with convulsions and ex« 
pires. 

The effiision of water into the ventricles 
of the brain is therefore, considered in this 
practical point of view, only a consequence 
of the disease ; it itself being purely inflam- 
matory.

Dropsy is a preternatural accumulation Dropsy. 
of serum, in any part of the body. 

During cold wet weather, it is more com- 
mon than in summer. Persons of a seden- 
tary life are more apt to be affected by this 
disease than those who take moderate exer- ' 
cise^ Dram-drinkers in particular are most 
commonly at length affected with dropsy. 
In short, dropsy seldom, if ever happens, 
but in lax or reduced habits, from irregulari- 
ty in living, too great us^ of spirituous li- 
quors, from debilitating diseases, or from 
improper remedies used for their removal. 

Affections of the heart, lungs, vena por- 
tarum of the liver, or indeed any cause ob- 
structing the free passage of venous blood, 
such, for instance, as pressure on any consi- 
derable vein, will cause dropsy. Disease of 
glands too, through which lymphatic vessels 
pass, cause it and obstruction also to the free 
return ot venous blood to the heart, by liga- 
tures, &c in some habits causes dropsy. 

All the species of dropsy, however, seem 
to depend on one general cause. The ex- 
halmg v< ssels, in health, constantly pour out 
a watery fluid which, without being allowed 
to accumulate, is absorbed by other vessels 
formed for that purpose ; and it is a derange- 
ment in the action of one or both these 
kinds of vessels which causes this disease. 



248 



This is more commonly a symptom of 
some other complaint than an original dis- 
ease. 

Although, however, dropsy sometimes ap- 
pears only in one form, it very frequently 
occurs in every form of the disease. The 
urine becoming less in quantity, is a symp- 
tom of this complaint. In it, indeed, the 
urine is always scanty, high coloured ; and, 
when cool, deposits a reddish sediment. 

If the diluent liquors taken in be greater 
than the evacuation by urine, the disease will 
most certainly increase. 

Dropsical complaints are very apt to re-» 
cur after their entire removal, which renders 
them in general dangerous diseases. And 
even although dropsy does not recur after 
its removal by medicines or otherwise, the 
patient is seldom afterwards in good health, 
owing to the vitiated state of the whole sys- 
tem. 

Hydrothorax, or water in the chest, often 
takes place to a considerable degree before 
it can be discovered to exist. By moving 
the body backward and forward, however, 
we are in general able to ascertain its exis- 
tence. 

In this water, it is remarkable, that these 
animals called hydatids frequently exist. 



249 



Diseases of the lungs and heart are caus- 
es of hydrothorax. It comes on with a 
sense of anxiety about the lower part of the 
sternum, and this is followed by some diffi- 
culty in breathing in malting an ascent, and 
while in bed. 

In the commencement of the disease, the 
patient feels thirst, with a tickling dry 
cough, and is easily put out of breath on 
going up a hill. This frequent and dry 
cough, however, is soon accompanied with 
an expectoration of thin mucus. In this 
disease, too, the pulse is small and quick, 
and remarkably irregular, and the lips be- 
come livid. Persons also affected with ad- 
vanced hydrothorax complain of coldness of 
the air when this is not felt by others, and 
they are often feverish. The patient in this 
disease, can lie easiest on the back. In 
some cases of it, however, the sleep is bro- 
ken by difficult breathing, anxiety, and pal- 
pitation of the heart, which immediately re- 
quires an upright posture. Frightful dreams 
trouble the patient. The pulse often sinks 
30 low as 24 or 28 beats in a minute ; it is 
often irregular ; the feet and legs often 
. swell ; the face is pale, sometimes almost li- 
vid, and when death is suddenly brought on, 
it becomes nearly black. 



250 



Before death, in this disease, a spitting of 
blood sometimes occurs ; and the patient 
often dies when he lies down suddenly, or 
on turning qui'kly in bed, by the water sud- 
denly compressnig the lungs, and causing 
suffocation* 

In ascites, or water in the belly, the swel- 
ling is often immense, and present to the 
hand a regular and smooth surface. This 
water is often in cysts, and then there is 
considerable inequality over the whole belly. 
When ascites is thus incysted, many of the 
most alarming and troublesome symptoms 
of dropsy are absent. 

Striking the belly on one side, while we 
hold our other hand on the opposite side of 
the belly, is a good way to ascertain if water 
exists there, as, if it does exist, a tremulous 
effect is produced. 

Ascites is often a consequence of diseased 
liver, or of an enlargement of the spleen or 
pancreas. 
jt Though ascites is sometimes accompa* 

nied by fever, yet it is frequently absent 
It has, however, been observed, that during 
ascites, the derangement in the general 
system is greater than in the other species 
of dropsy. 



251 



This disease sooner or latter occasions 

« 

cedematous swellings of the lower extremi- 
ties. 

Dropsy is called anasarca when it exists 
in the cellular substance. This disease not 
being at all times attended by any other af- 
fection of the system, is therefore, in many 
instances, easily removed. 

In anasarca, the under extremities are 
most apt to become w nderfully swelled, 
while the penis and scrotum becomes great- 
ly distended. The legs in a depending pos»- 
ture generally swell at any time, but most 
particularly toward night, and this is often 
greatly removed before getting out of bed in 
the morning. 

Compression of the vena cava by the pres- 
sure of the uterus during pregnancy, oftea 
causes swellings of the legs ; but the cause 
being removed, and the constitution not be- 
ing impaired by disease, they entirely abate^ 
This likewise occurs in very old people, and 
during hot weather. 

Pressure with the finger in anasarcou« 
swellings leaves a hollow, which remains (or 
sometime, even after the pressure is re*- 
moved. 

When little blisters, containing yellowish 
matter^ appear on dropsical extremities^ 



252 



they show the disease to be in general of a 
bad kind, and form sores which are often 
very difficult to heal. When persons who 
have long complairted of disorders of the 
lungs or bowels are affected with swellings 
of the legs, it usually constitutes one of the 
worst forms of dropsy of these parts ; and 
when anasarca pervades the whole body^ 
even to the head, we find the leg's least 
swelled in the morning upon getting out of 
bed, and the head swelled in the greatest 
degree. This last, however, falls during the 
day as the other increases.

Leucorr- This disease is in general a consequence 
^^* of previous inflammatory action. It is the 

most common disease with with which /e- 
males are affected, and although not imme- 
diately fatal, often unperceivedly saps the 
constitution, and renders the body liable 
to the attack of numerous and destructive 
diseases. 

It begins by a discharge per vaginam ; 
pains in the back and loins, in the head, 
stomach, &c. with general lassitude and de- 



253 



bility soon follow. Sleep also is disturbed 
by fearful dreams, and yields no refresh 
ment. The patient at length looks pale and 
emaciated, her eyes are dull, and most dis- 
tressing flushing of the face is alternated by 
the most ghastly paleness. At length, the 
feet and ancles swell. The mind becomes 
dejected, apprehensive, easily alarmed and 
occasionally affected with deep melancholy. 
She then becomes peevish, fretful, irascible 
and anxious, which tend only to increase 
the complaint. The functions of generation 
are at length almost destroyed, and it is a 
very common cause of sterility. 

Hysteria also, in a greater or less degree, is 
almost always a concomitant of this affec- 
tion. The urine is turbid, the menstrual 
discharge is sometimes scanty^ or even sup- 
pressed ; at other times it is too copious, 
irregular, discoloured and attended with 
most indescribable pain. 

This disease is seldom, if ever, removed 
by nature, and, if artificial means are defer- 
red, it sooner or latter proceeds to waste the 
constitution with accumulating mischief. 
Every symptom becomes aggravated to the 
utmost pitch. The eyelids and face swell, 
become bloated and disfigured ; the body 
becomes astonishmgly meagre and debilitat-

Fever and dysentery seem to arise either 
from the effluvia occasioned by derange- 
ments of soil, or by filthiness of manners. 
Fever. The ordinary state of the pulse in a heal- 

thy person ought to be from 73 to 76 beats 
in a minute. There are exceptions to this 
rule, but they are not common. It is there- 
fore when the actions of the sanguiferous 
system are principally disturbed, and the 
temperature of the body subject to unnatur- 
al variations, that the disease is termed fe- 
ver. 

Febrile diseases are in general attended 
^with cold shivering, succeeded by heat, in- 
creased frequency of pulse, and diminution 
of strength. 

Fevers are of various kinds, and of various

degrees of severity, according to the country 
and circumstances which give rise to them^ 
as well as the difference of constitution of 
those exposed to their influence. They are, 
however, probably much more nearly allied 
to each other, in some of their more impor- 
tant characters, than we are usually in the 
habit of believing. 

Fevers are intermittent, remittent, or con- 
tinued ; as in the first a distinct intermission 
takes place between the paroxysms ; in the 
second, no intermission, but an abatement in 
the paroxysms occurs ; in the third, no well 
marked remission takes place. 

In intermittent fever, the fit is either a 
quotidian, returning every day ; or a tertian, 
returning every other day ; and if there be 
the interval of two days between the fits, it 
is called a quartan. Much longer intervals 
have been ' known ; but these happen sel- 
dom, and have been distinguished by no 
name. • '• - 

As the fevers in cities or towns^ or where 
the atmospheric air is impregnated with noxi- 
ous effluvia, are, in general, of the conti- 
nued kind, or those known under the term 
of typhus or synochus, it is to the consi- 
deration of these that I shall now confinq

vourable symptom. These are of differeiil 
tsUzes and clours^ but in general small. 
They are black, brown, or whitish. The 
black are the most dangerous, the brown 
next, and the whitish, or rather yellowish, 
least ; but all of them during fevers are to 
be considered as dangerous indications. . 

A great flow of urine is in general a fa* 
vourable symptom, but if it be very pale iq 
fevers, unless the pgtient has drunk much 
small liquor, it is much worse than when 
it deposits a sediment, which shows that 
the distemper is beginning to abate. Viscid ~ 
and partial sweats, too^ in typhus, are always 
dangerous. 

Delirium, throbbing of the temporal and 
carotid arteries, anxiety, laborious breath*

are all unfavourable symptoms.

olothes, as if observing spots on them, re-

When double vision takes place, whert thje 
eyes become fixed, dim, and ghastly, when 
deglutition fails, so that the patient is un- 
able to put out his tongue, when rattling in 
the throat begins, and blue and green spots 
(worse than petechiae) appear ^ the body, 
we may consider all hope of recovery at an 
end. ' 

A curious fact too, occurs to my recollec- 
tion of the effects of climate on our common 
typhus. — A frigate sailed from Portsmouth 
for the West Indies ; and soon after it sailed^ 
several of the crew were taken ill with ty- 
phus fever. As they advanced into the warni 
climate, all the symptoms were 'aggravated, 
the skin became yellow ; but still the typho- 
-id symptoms continued, and when they ar- 
rived, those thus affected distinctly possess- 
ed the peculiar disease of the country. 



When a person is seized by any feverish Jail Fever; 
complaint, such as a simple remittent or 
cold, and neglects cleanliness, is despondent, 
and has no supplies of fresh air, a virulent 
degree of infection is often produced. If 
confined to the murky air of a jail, hospital^ 
or ship, the most malignant fever will be 
pccasipned ; and if to a crowded apartpienti 

B 2 



^60 

as happens in the families of the poor^ a con- 
tagious fever will be generated, differing only 
from the jail, hospital, or ship fever, in de* 
grce. 

The hospital and jail- fevers are to be con- 
sidered as the same disease^ and little, if at 
all, differing from such as have arisen after 
battles, when the bodies of the slain have 
been left unburied to rot upon the field. 

This fever is commonly preceded by a 
disagreeable lassitude, till acute pains of 
the head and back, great oppression and 
anxiety on the breast, irregular shiver- 
ing fits, frequently a foul, furred, bilious 
tongue, and often a bad taste in the 
mouth come on; a quick pulse is found 
in many ; whilst in others, it is sfnall and 
quick, or tremulous* Small interchanges 
of heat and cold, are perceptible, aJso 
trembling of the hand, numbness of the 
arms, weakness of the Kmbs, and loss of 
appetite. On the second or third day, the 
tongue becomes black and parched, and the 
sick have little or no thirst ; nor do they 
make any complaint, but of want of sleep, 
which yet they seem too much inclined to. 

About this time, stupor, a leading crite- 
rion in the fever, universally comes on ; the 
pulse, which at first is often full, now sinks; 
and they have little or no extraordinary heat 



a6i 



of skin, in generaL Some, about the third 
or fourth day^ talk incoherently ; but this 
6oon changes into an insensible stupor,-, and 
in a little time come on cold and clammy 
sweats. In many, on the second or third 
day, dusky or florid specks, like flea-bites^ 
appear ail over the body, or neck, breast and 
arms ; and whenever they appear, the pulse 
sinks wonderfully ; sometimes little red lines 
also run out, diverging from the petechiae, 
and extending frequently a good way on the 
surface of the skin. The eyes seem much 
affected frpm the beginning ; but the same 
patient, who looks with a wild stare on the 
£rst days of the distemper, soon sinks into 
that of stupor, with a shining gloss on the W 
white of the eye and cartilaginous part of 
the eye- lids. They continue thus, almost 
senseless many days, and are uncommonly 
oppressed, before the crisis, with much sigh- 
ing and anxiety across the chest. The 
pulse, after the fifth or sixth day, is so ex--- 
ceedingly hurried, as scarcely to, be number- 
ed; and, for some days before death, an 
offensive cadaverous stench issues from the '\ 

body. 

One of the most unfavourable circum- 
stances attending this fever is, the proneness 
to a relapse, the danger of which is greatest 

Jk 3

during the hot weather, less, in the decline 
of autumn, and least of all after the frost 
begim. 



Dysentery. Dysentery is, perhaps, one of the most 
distressing complaints in hot climates ; and, 
it has been observed, that auch seasons as 
produce most flies, caterpillars, and other 
insects, whose increase depends so much on 
heat and moisture, and consequently on cor- 
ruption, have likewise been most productive 
of the dysentery. 

It is much more frequent in warm than 
W in cold climates ; and is most common in 
summer or in autumn. 

A specific contagion is always to be, con- 
sidered as the remote cause of this com- 
plaint. Irregularity in living, however, in 
those countries where dysentery is common, 
is very apt to induce it ; and Soldiers lying 
on cold damp grounds in crowded camps, 
and the passengers in slave shi|)S, &c. arei 
.^. very liable to be affected by it. 

It is sometimes preceded by slight diar- 
rhoea, and there is then an unusual flatulence 
in the bowels. 

In general, the contagion is Qot suddenly 
diffused. For, whole towns and camps are 



263 



never seized at once, in consequenqe of the 
imparity of the atmosphere ; but tHi? infec- 
tion is carried from one to another, ^y the 
effluvia, or clothes, bedding, See. of the 
tainted person ; as is the case with the plague, 
small pox, and measles. 

This disease is not so infectious as roost 
other contagious dise^ises ; but it always is so, 
in a certain degree, particularly in military 
hospitals, and in the houses of the poor who 
want the means of cleanliness. 

The putrid effluvia of the dysenteric ^es 
not only produce a similar disease : but are 
apt to propagate the common bloody flux, 
and likewise to breed the malignant hospital 
fever, with or without bloody stools. 

The symptoms of dysentery, are frCi* 
quent want of going to stool with ex- 
cessive pain, from which, by passing a small 
quantity of mucus tinged with blood, or even 
blood itself, no felief is obtained ; fever of 
an inflammatory kind, is more or less constant 
during the disease; a pain just under, the na-» 
vel, with nausea, vomiting, fever, loss of ap- 
petite, sleep, and strength. When at stool^ 
there is most violent and distressing strainng* 
The stools are not, however, at all times of 
mucus : they are of various consistence, most-*^ 
ly hard, and in separate balls ; at times nvix<^ 
ed with membraneous films, and at all tim^s 

r4 






unusually fsetid. When a free evacuation is 
procured, the pains and tenesmus abate in 
their violence. 

During this disease, it is extremely pro- 
bable, from the appearance of the evacuated 
matter, that the intestines are less or more 
in a constricted state. There is seldom any 
evacuation of natural feces ; but, when they 
do appear, they are generally in a compact 
and hardened form. 

Inflammation, and even ulceration of the 
bowels have been known to accompany this 
disease, and the patients sometimes become 
hectic and dropsical. We must not, how- 
ever, mistake, for dropsy, the very great dis- 
tention of the bowels with air which, in this 
disease, is often present. 

The disease often terminates fatally in a 
few days ; at other times, if the fever be not 
violent, it is protracted for several weeks or 
even months, when still it may terminate 
suddenly, but the chances of escape are then 
more to be depended on. 

When the disease terminates fatally, there 
is often present a great tendency to a putrid 
or gangrenous state. The patient will often, 
however, linger under the disease for months, 
when he may be affected by inflammation of 
the bowels. 



265 



SSS. 



We have now to consider some of the 
most important of those diseases which arise, 
not from natural, but from artificial causes ; 
namely, depraved mpdes of living, &c. These 
diseases are of the liver, stomach, and hpwels. 

The most common, but^ least dangerous Liver 
complaints of -the liver, arise from stones piaints, 
obstructing the gall' ducts* When this, 
however, continuea for some length of time, 
it is attended with pain at stomach, jaundice, 
or yellowness of the skin, sickness, vomit- 
ing, languor, inactivity, sleeplessness ; and, 
lastly, wasting of the flesh. 

Affections of the stomach precede dis-*||^ •;: 
eases of the liver, caused by the abuse of 
spirituous liquors even in a diluted state. 
Their excess, however, hurts the liver more 
than the stomach, to which they are imme- 
diately applied, or indeed more than any 
other of the abdominal viscera. A seden- 
tary life, also, with grief and anxiety, weak- 
ens the powers of the stomach, which ulti- 
mately affects the liver. 

Inflammation of the liver may be acute or 
it may be chronic The acute affects the 
membrane ; the chronic, the substance of 
the viscus. It is to the last of these that 
the liver is most subject. 



/ 



266 



Chronic inflammation of the liver, though 
not at first alarming, is attended with diffi- 
cnk breathing on making any exertion, flatu- 
lence, indigestion, acidity, and costiveness ; 
the flesh and strength are gradually wasted^ 
and the complexion becomes bloated or pale 
and sallow. 

This inflammation of the liver is often 
mistaken for a dyspeptic state of the sto* 
snach. 

Acute hepatitis is particularly incident to 
the East Indies, and very commonly ter- 
ininates in suppuration. When, however, 
that has been checked, it becomes chronic, 
with schirrous indurations. 
^ This disease may be caused by falls, blows, 
hj cold applied to the body, or by passions 
of the mind ; it may exist with, or be produced 
by, other diseases. 

The symptoms of acute hepatitis are pain 
in the right side, often extending to the 
shoulder, slight cough, fever with a hard 
strong pulse, high-coloured urine; hickup*^ 
ing and vomitiTig often attend it ; and when 
the disease is very severe, the patient can 
only lie on the affected side. 

In this disease, pain in the region of the 
liver is very acute, attended with diflScult 
and painful respiration, great watchfulness 
and occassional delirium. The tongue is 



267 



covered with a white crust, and the mouth 
and fauces are extremely dry. The urine 
al$o is secreted in small quantity, high->co« 
loured, and frequently tinged with bile. 

If for a few days the fever and pain in- 
crease, suppuration is the consequence ; du- 
ring this, frequent rigours are felt, and a 
sense of weight succeeds that of acute pain. 

If the inflammation be violent, and ac- 
tive means delayed, suppuration will also be 
the consequence, and if the inflammation 
be moderate, it will degenerate into schirru8« 
Sometimes, however, the pain subsides sud- 
denly, the pulse fluttlers, the extremities 
become cold, arid deliquium and death en- 
sue. • # 

If the external or convex part of the liver 
be affected in this disease, a tumour may^ 
though not always, be observed, and pressure 
occasions pain ; if the inner or concave be 
affected, there is difficult and painful respir- 
ation, dry and frequent cough, and shooting 
pains extending toward the shoulder. 

like other inflammations, this may ter* 
minate by resolution, auppuration, or by 
gangrene. 

The symptoms of suppuration are a di*» 
minution of pain, sense of pulsation, weight 
in the region of the liver, frequent returning 



2fl8v 

rigours, fever towards evening, flushings of 
the countenance, a propensity to profuse 
sweating, and o^her symptoms of hectic 
jfever. 

The period of suppuration is influenced 
by the degree of inflammation, the climate^ 
season of the year, 6r the remedies that have 
been employed. 

If the discharge, in consequence of sup- 
puration, be through the diaphragm into the 
thorax, or directly into the abdomen, the 
disease frequently proves fatal. When eva- 
cuation of matter by the intestines takes 
place, it is conveyed to them by the hepa- 
tic duct, or more frequently at the part of 
the intestines where adnesion has been form^ 
ed with the liver, and ulceration has followed. 
In some, a great abscess of the liver preterm 
naturally makes its way into the stomach or 
bowels; immediately the patient voids, by 
vomiting or purging, most oflTensiye. matter^ 
and dies in a few hours. 

Schirrous may exist in the liver without 
previous active inflammation, as in those 
who have long resided in warm climates. By 
this indeed schirrosity of the liver is moat 
generally caused, and by the abuse of ardent 
spirits. 

The progress of schirrus in the liver, is 
probably similar to the same disease in th^ 



a69 



breasts of women. Inflammation in it occa- 
sionally increases and abates, the intervals 
between such attacks at last became shorter, 
the appetite and strength fail, and the flesh 
wastes by degrees; there is some cough, 
hiccup, and at length dropsy. 

The very worst cases of liver complaints 
may proceed through their whole course 
without jaundice being caused by them. 



Perhaps there are no complaints to which stomacai 
the human frame is liable, in which such S^^g^ 
completely unfeigned misery is experienced^ 
as in some states of diseased or of depraved ^ 

digestioti. 

Stomach complaints may sometimes exist 
in consequence of loss of tone in its muscu- 
lar fibres. The habits which cause a loss of 
tone in the stomach, are frequent drinking 
of warm watery liquids, surfeits, frequent 
vomiting, &c. Schirrus in the pyloric ori- 
fice or outlet of the stomach, is generally 
caused by abuse of ardent spirits; and 
there are numerous glands at this part 
y^hich, from these practices, are very apt, in 
certain persons, to become affected. It pro- 
duces the highest acidity in the stomach. 
Regurgitation of bile also into the stomach 



270 

1 

produces languor of body, nausea, foul 
tongue, and indigestion; or, being direct- 
ed to the intestines, produces k pain- 
ful diarrhoea. Thosie pursuits too of any 
description which irritate and distress the 
mind, invariably cause a derangement in the 
digestive organs. 

Many, perhaps most of the diseases of the 
digestive organs, caused by various circum- 
stances, consist in a weakness and irritability 
of the affected parts, accompanied by a de- 
ficiency or depravity of these parts, or by a 
deficiency or depravity of the fltiids secreted 
by them, and upon the healthy qualities of 
which the right performance of the func- 
tions depend. 

If the tongue be furred at its back part in 
the morning, when there is no fever, and 
when the patient has taken no stimulating 
or indigestible food on the preceding night, 
it is reasonable to infer in general, that the 
state of the tongue is owing to its partici- 
pating in that of the stomach. The state 
of the tongue is, in general, an infallible 
criterion of a disordered condition of that 
organ, but it does not point out the kind 
and degree of that disorder. With the fur- 
red tongue, a disagreeable taste is felt in the 
morning, and the breath, in most instances^ 
independently of the greatest care that can 



'271 

be taken, acquires a ipost disagreeable smell. 
Sometimes the cuticle of the tongue seems 
to have lost its usual colour, and to become 
permanently white, in consequence of con* 
tinued disease. 

In some states of depraved digestion, 
there is almost a complete disrelish for food, 
yet the appetite is not impaired, as, at the 
stated periods of eating, the patient can, 
though without much gratification to him* 
self, eat heartily.- Appetite is therefore 
sometimes moderately good when digestion 
is imperfect ; and the latter may not be de- 
ficient, although the disease may exist. In 
some instances, indeed, the appetite is in* 
ordinate. 

With hard drinkers, however, sickness 
and vomiting frequently occur in the morn- 
ing. The loathing of food at breakfast, 
when the stomach ought to be most vigor- 
ous, is a leading symptom of a weak sto- 
mach, and disordered constitution. , 

In some ruined constitutions, there is an 
almost perpetual feverishness and thirst, with 
loss of appetite and strength, and shortness 
of breath. 

With vertigo, arising from the stomach, 
there is depraved appetite, indigestion, fla- 
tulence, pain and weight in the stomach, 
sickness, vomiting, costiveness and worms; 



272 



That which is pretty generally known tinder 
the name of the water brash, which is an 
occasional involuntary discharge of clear 
fluid from the mouthy is in consequence of 
a most distressing state of the stomach. 

In stomach complaints, there is also often 
pain in the eye-balls^ giddiness and sound- 
ing in the ears* The mind likewise of those 
affected with stomach complaints, is fre- 
quently irritable and despondent ; and an- 
xiety and langour are • expressed in the 
countenance. The pulse is frequent and 
feeble^ and slight exercise produces consider- 
able perspiration and fatigue. They are 
restless at nighty and their sleep is not re- 
freshing; they are also affected with lassi- 
tude, are easily alarmed, and feel as if inca- 
pable of moving in bed, — an affection knc wn 
by the name of the night-mare. The ;o- 
mach often becomes so diseased, that the 
patient's terror, he knows not for what^ is 
indescribable. Neither amusement, society, 
nor the soothing voice of friendship, can 
alleviate his distresses : he knows no com- 
fort during the day, and sleep, undisturb- 
ed by the utmost horror, seldom refreshes 
him ; he is a burden to himself, and to all 
those who take an interest in his welfare. 

Though Dyspepsia and Hypochondriasis 
are neither of them dangerous^ they often 



aiz 



induce other diseases which prove danger- 
ous. A stomach vitiated by bad habits^ is 
with diiGcuIty reformed, but may ultimately 
be reconciled to simple and healthy aliment* 
And wretched^ indeed^ is that state of exis* 
tence where the natural powers have lost 
their vigour, and where artificial me^ns 
alone can be depended on to procure tern-* 
porary relief; where the feverish and prer 
carious existence is alone preserved and ren* 
dered bearable by the very means which 
must soon wear it out. 

There can be no doubt that diseases of Bowel 
the stomach affect the intestinal canal; S^^g^ 
otherwise in a healthy state, and that diseas* 
es of the small intestines extend their influ- 
ence to the stomach. 

When digestion is imperfectly executed, 
the functions of the intestinal canal must soon 
participle in the disorder of the stomach. 
For if undigested matter pass from the sto-^ 
mach into the intestines, \t cannot be sup* 
posed that its powers are capable of convert- 
ing it into the chyle, or milky fluid, which 
is separated from the digested food to be ad- 
ded to the blood. 

'It will, I think, be generally granted, that 
the state of the excretions from the bowel* 
commonly indicates the healthy or disorder? 
fd state of those organs.

Diarrhsea in general is a mild^ simple dis-^ 
case, often caused by some irritating or of* 
fensive substance taken into the stomach, 
and when it is expelled by the disease which 
it induced, or otherwise, the patient recovers. 

When the bowels have become much dis- 
ordered from irregularity in living, or other 
causes, grating or sometimes sharp pains 
are felt in them, with a constant but very 
partial desire to evacuate them ; and there 
is, at the same time, some difficulty in pas- 
sing water. From time to time, too, the 
belly swells, occasioning indescribable unea- 
siness, particularly .while in bed, and, in this 
state, they often continue for several years. 

Various acute, or otherwise distressing 
pains may exist in the bowels from differ- 
ent causes. There is often a languidness in 
their performing the functions of assimila^ 
tion and expulsion, which is productive of 
sickness, vomiting, tenesmus, flatulence, a 
sense of fullness and tension of the belly, 
borborigmi, pains like cramp, difficulty in 
passing water, with acid eructations. At 
Qther times, the ovaries, womb, bladder, 
l:idneys, spleen, pancreas, liver, omentum^ 
&c. stones in the gall-bladder, schirrous tu- 
mours and ulcers in the abdomen, wormsy 
ruptures, colica pictonum, ileus, and mal» 



275 



cotiformatioiis^ occasion pains of yarious 
kinds. 

With respect to wormSj those I propose to 
take notice of here, being most common, are 
the round worm, very much resembling the 
earth worm in appearance, and the very 
small one called ascarides, which is pointed 
at one end and round at the other. 

The round worm is chiefly to be found in 
the small intestine, though sometimes in 
the stomachy and the most common situation 
for the small worm, or ascarides, is in the 
rectum. The round worms are even some- 
times voided alive by the mouth. They 
are more apt to produce affection of the ge- 
neral system than ascarides. 

Various symptoms accompany worms in 
the intestines, and these animals, of various 
kinds, hive often been known to exist 
there without occasioning any troublesome 
symptom at all. 

Although all the following symptoms sel- 
dom if ever appear in one person affected 
with worms, they are found more or less to 
prevail. A swollen upper lip, itching of 
the nostrils, grinding of the teeth, giddiness, 
pain in the head, with languid eyes seldom 
entirely shut while asleep, dilatation of the 
pupils, sleep restless, from which the patient 
wakes in a fright; slight convulsions,feverish- 



276 

ness, thirst, with frequent discharges of water 
from the mouth, frequent changes of co- 
lour, with cold sweats, depraved taste, of- 
fensive breath, dry tickling cough, shortness 
of breath, corroded gums, hiccup, itching at 
the nose and fundament, oppression at the 
stomach, and irregularity and pain in the 
bowels; sickness, milky urine, fainting or 
trembling, unequal desire for food, some- 
times a most voracious appetite, sadness, 
with debility and wasting of the flesh, and 
at length a horrid appearance of the coun- 
tenance, the belly becoming large and hard^ 
and the limbs thin and soft» 

The existence of worms in the intestines 
has often been mistaken for hydrocephelus 
internus, or water in the head» 

An account of many other universally 
prevailing diseases might have been insert- 
ed here ; but this^ in such a work^ was in* 
admissible*
