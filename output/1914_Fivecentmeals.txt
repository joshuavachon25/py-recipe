INTRODUCTION 



THIS Bulletin is a part of the book Low Cost Cooking* 
by Miss Florence Nesbitt, Field Supervisor and 
Dietitian of the Department of Relief of the Juvenile 
Court of Chicago, and formerly one of the visiting house- 
keepers of the United Charities of Chicago. 

The book and bulletin give instructions for providing 
wholesome and palatable meals at the least possible expense, 
with simple equipment and reasonable expenditure of time. 
Recipes give quantities suitable for serving families of six 
with two adults, or seven with one adult. 

With careful buying and with little or no waste the 
meals given can be provided for fifteen cents per day per 
person — hence the title of the bulletin, 'Tive-Cent Meals." 
By buying in wholesale quantities the cost might be made 
less, but retail city prices at the cheapest stores, under 
ordinary conditions are intended. In such a dietary no 
butter, high-priced meats or fruits or vegetables, and 
few kinds of canned goods can be included ; few eggs at 
high prices can be used, though desirable for the chil- 
dren. A fair quantity of milk is included because it is 
necessary for the health of young children. Reliance must 
be placed chiefly on the flours and meals, sugar, meat and 
cheese at low prices, dried beans and peas, winter vege- 
tables, dried fruits, oleomargarine in place of butter, and 
''drippings" in place of lard. 

Too often poor cooking and the way the money is 
spent rather than the amount, accounts for under nutri- 
tion and under development of the children. It is in the 
hope of assisting in the immensely important problem of 
feeding the family on little that the book and bulletin are 
published by the American School of Home Economies. 

'^The price of Lozv Cost Cooking for single copies is 50 cents post- 
paid, on approval ; in lots of twenty or more, 25 cents, direct from 
American School of Home Economics, 506 W. 69th St., Chicago. 



AMERICAN SCHOOL OF HOME ECONOMICS

February. 1915 

Dear Friend; 

This Bulletin "Five Cent Meals" explains itself, the book 
"Low Cost Cooking" is not yet completed. Although written for 
a special purpose, the Bulletin is sent to all members. The 
address of many of our 15,000 members is uncertain and no doubt 
a thousand or more Bulletins will be wasted. This is quite an 
item. 

NOTE. No further Bulletins will be sent to members from whom 
we have not heard for one (1) year. 

In this connection I beg to remind many members that they 
were enrolled in the School for one year only, the privileges to 
be continued indefinitely provided they sent eight or more names 
of acquaintances who might be interested in our courses, at the 
end of the year. The sending of names is vital to the progress 
and prosperity of the School. We shall deeply appreciate the 
courtesy of all who send in names. Use this sheet. Your name 
will NOT be mentioned. 

On the last page of this Bulletin you will find a condensed 
synopsis of the new course "HOUSEHOLD ENGINEERING, SCIENTIFIC 
MANAGEMENT IN THE HOME". This is the next step beyond house- 
hold science, which as you know, tells the "Why" and "Where- 
fore" in household affairs. Household Engineering is the HOW 
in detail — methods, arrangements and tools for doing the work of 
the home in the easiest, quickest and most effective way. 

Our present courses go into this to some extent, but Mrs. 
Frederick has applied the new scientific management and 
efficiency engineering to the everyday tasks of housekeeping. 
Naturally the great majority of our members are "good house- 
keepers", but this Household Engineering achieves results equal 
to those in other long established trades and industries. For 
example, in bricklaying scientific management has doubled the 
number of bricks laid with less effort to the workman. In 
housekeeping it means doing the work better in a third to a half 
less time. Impossible you say, but that is what the masons 
said! 

Household Engineering gives a new and fascinating viewpoint 
to old and familiar tasks. I am sure you will find the new 
course intensely interesting. It will be divided into twelve 
parts — pamphlets of from forty to sixty pages, abundantly illus- 
trated, with a brief series of questions (not over five) to be 
sent in on each part. The twelve parts will be sent one per 
month whether the reports are made or not. The tuition fee of 
the course will be S12.00 or S15.00 when completed. To those 



who receive this Bulletin we make an introductory price of 
S5,00 — $1.00 now before Part I is issued and SI. 00 on receipt of 
each of the first four parts, or you may pay S4.50 in full now. 
As with all of our courses, payments are on approval. If Part 
I and II do not suit you, you may return them and the money paid 
will be returned to you . 

Use the coupon below if you wish to be with us in our "next 
step forward." 

Sincerely yours.

BREAKFAST 

Monday 

CORN MEAL GRIDDLE CAKES WITH CARAMEL SYRUP 

FRIED BACON STRIP 

COFFEE FOR ADULTS, MILK FOR CHILDREN 

Corn Meal Griddle Cakes 

2 cups cornmeal ij^ cups liquid, milk and 

1 cup flour water mixed 

2 tablespoons melted drip- 6 teaspoons baking powder 
pings i^ teaspoons salt 

^lix and sift dry ingredients, add liquid and mix quickly. 
Have ready a hot greased griddle or frying pan, drop the 
mixture in by tablespoonfuls, as many as the pan will hold 
without their touching. Cook on slow fire until the cakes 
are brown on the lower side and the bubbles burst in the 
top; turn each cake to brown on the other side. Cook in 
this way until the batter is all used. Serve hot. 

"Drippings" 

By drippings is meant the fat from roasting, frying or 
boiling meat, fat trimmings, etc. Eicvy bit of fat coining 
into the house should he saved and used. 

When more fat is needed the soft tiank fat of beef or 
pork, which sells for about lo cents a pound, may be used. 
Cut the fat into small pieces, removing any skin and bits 
of meat. Cover with cold salted water and let stand for 
4 or 5 hours or over night. This improves keeping qualities 
and flavor. ^ Soak again if there is time. Now melt the 
fat slowly in the oven or over boiling water and cook 
until the scraps are crisp but not brown. Strain into clean 
pails, cans or jars which can be covered. Keep in a cool 
place. Use like lard, Crisco, etc., which costs about 5 cents 
a pound more. When using in recipes calling for butter, 
add more salt and take a little less because butter contains 
salt and is one-eighth water. 

Strongly flavored fats from bacon, ham and sausage 
should be kept separate and used for hashes or warming 
over potatoes. 

^^"^^i All measurements are level— Ml spoons and cups and level with 
a case knife. Cup means measurinq cup; cost ." cents. 

A cup contains 16 tablespoons ; a tablespoon contains 3 teaspoons.

Caramel Syrup 

2 cups sugar >3 cup water 

Put sugar and water in stewing pan, boil the syrup, stir- 
ring occasionally until it turns a light brown. Add i cup 
])oiling water, and boil until of thickness desired. 

Fried Bacon Strips 

Cut thin slices of bacon from the strip. Remove skin and 
rind, lay the slices in a cold frying pan, cook until crisp and 
brown, turning as necessary. 

Bacon strips are the odd-shaped pieces of bacon cut from the side 
in the process of trimming. It sells for 14 to 22 cents per pound in 
pieces weighing 4 to 8 pounds. 

Coffee 

14 cup ground coffee 2 cups (i pint) boiling water 

Moisten coffee with cold water ; add to boiling water and 
boil from one to three minutes. Keep hot without boiling 
for ten minutes longer. Add 2 tablespoons of cold water 
to settle the grounds and it is ready to serve. 

If a crushed egg-shell is added to the ground cofifee with 
the cold water when making it will settle more easily and 
surely. Do not allow the coffee to stand on the grounds ; 
if not served at once, pour off and keep hot. See that the 
coffee pot is well washed and aired. Ground coffee loses 
flavor and strength, and if possible it is best to grind the 
coffee in a small hand mill just before making. 

Preparing the Meal 

Put water to boil for coffee ; set table except for the 
plates, which should be heated in some convenient way. Cut 
and prepare bacon. Make coft'ee if water has boiled. Meas- 
ure out ingredients for griddle cakes, mix thein and start 
cooking, placing the cakes as they are done on a plate over 
a pan of boiling water. When the cakes are half done 
fry the bacon attending to both at the same time. The hot 
drippings from the bacon may be used with the cakes. 

Wash the top of the milk bottle, remove stopper and 
pour off the top of the milk for coffee; put the rest in 
glasses for the children. Serve the cakes on the hot plates, 
settle and pour the coffee.

10 



Suet Pudding 

1 cup flour 3 teaspoons baking powder 

2 cups bread crumbs >:; teaspoon salt 

I cup linely chopped suet Grating of nutmeg 

I cup sugar i cup milk or water 

]\Iix the suet well with the flour, add other ingredients, 
and make into a smooth batter. The pudding- may be either 
steamed or boiled, or baked. For steaming put into a but- 
tered pan, or baking dish, cover with paper or a tin lid. 
and set in a larger kettle of boiling water. Cook about an 
hour. 

For boiling, tie the dough up in a floured cloth and boil 
from 2^ to 3 hours. It may be baked in the same way as 
cake. 

Serve with any of the pudding sauces, or as a cake with- 
out sauce. 

One or more eggs may be added to enrich the pudding, or 
a cup of raisins, chopped figs, dates, or nuts may be added 
to ^ive variety.

meat piled in the center and the pieces of vegetables ar- 
ranged around it. Serve the pudding, like cake, cut in 
squares without sauce. 

Extra Baking 

Just before starting lunch mix the bread and set it to 
rise. It will be ready for the second kneading after lunch 
is over. Make rolls from part of the bread dough. 

White Yeast Bread 

3 quarts flour 2 tablespoons salt 

1 quart hot water 2 yeast cakes stirred into 1/2 cup 

2 tablespoons sugar of lukewarm water 
2 tablespoons lard or other fat 

Put lard, sugar and salt in large pan or bowl and add 
the hot water. When lukewarm add the dissolved yeast and 
about 5 pints of flour. Stir until smooth, add the remaining 
flour and mix well. Turn the dough on to a board and 
knead until it is smooth and elastic. Place in a well-greased 

II 



pan, greasing the top of the dough and cover with clean 
cloth. Place where it will keep at a warm, even tempera- 
ture. When the dough has raised to double its size, which 
will be in about i>< hours, knead it again, form into loaves, 
grease the outside of the loaves and place them in a baking 
pan. Let the dough rise until it is again double its size! 
which it should do in about one hour, and bake for one 
hour in a moderately hot oven. 

The temperature at which bread dough is kept is one of 
the most important things about bread making. Yeast is a 
plant, and too much heat will kill it, while a low tempera- 
ture will keep it from growing and forming the gas bubbles 
which make the bread light. Bread must be baked thor- 
oughly in order to be wholesome. For this reason it is best 
not to make the loaves much, if any, larger than the common 
bakers' loaf, which weighs 12 ounces. This recipe will make 
eight such loaves. 

When the loaves are done place them sidewise on a rack 
or table, so that the air will circulate freely around them. 
If a soft crust is desired, cover the bread while cooling. 
When perfectly cold, place in a jar or tin box. 

Rye Bread 

3 cups white flour 2 cups hot water 

3 cups rye flour 2 tablespoons lard or other fat 

1/3 cup sugar or molasses i tablespoon salt 

I yeast cake dissolved in H cup lukewarm water 

Follow the directions for mixing, kneading and baking 
given for white bread, if caraway seeds are desired add one 
teaspoonful while kneading the second time. 

Cinnamon Rolls 

Roll bread dough to yi inch thick, at second kneading 
spread with fat and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, roll 
into a long roll, cut into y. inch slices, grease these on the 
outside, place in baking pan, when they have risen to twice 
their size, bake. 

Prune Rolls 

At the second kneading roll a layer of bread dough to 
the thickness of ^ inch and spread with a % inch layer of 
the mashed pulp of stewed prunes, cut into strips about 3 

12 



inches wide and 6 inches long. Fold the dough so that there 
will be a layer of prunes between two layers of dough, grease 
the outside, place in a greased pan, allow them to rise to 
twice their size, bake. 

Coffee Cake 

I cup hot milk Yz cup sugar 

yz cup lard i teaspoon salt 

1/2 yeast cake dissolved in ^ cup lukewarm water 

Add hot milk with lard and salt, when lukewarm, add 
dissolved yeast, flour enough to make the stiff batter — about 
three cups, cover dish and let the batter rise, then spread in 
a well greased pan, sprinkle with sugar and allow to rise, 
bake. If raisins are desired add ^ cup just before putting 
into baking pan.

Puree of Lima Beans 

4 cups cooked lima beans 2 slices fat pork 
2 cups water 2 tablespoons flour

For additional flavoring, if desired, use i tablespoon each 
of onion, parsley or celery, chopped fine. Fry pork until 
crisp and brown, break or cut it into small bits, stir the flour 
into the drippings and pork, and if onion or celery is used 
add this at the same time and cook for a few minutes. Add 
water and boil, mash the beans fine, and add them. If the 
whole IS too thick, add more water. The soup may be made 
more nutritious by using milk instead of water. 

Baked Banana
