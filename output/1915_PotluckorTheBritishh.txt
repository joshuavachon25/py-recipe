PREFACE 

This is not the ordinary conventional cookery book, 
affording instructions how to dress, cook, and 
serve every variety of joint, fish, vegetable, etc., 
etc., etc. I take for granted that the reader is 
already acquainted with ordinary means and 
methods, and is versed in the preparation of simple 
food. To be a " good plain " cook always appears 
to me a contradiction in terms : because, if a per- 
son's treatment of plain dishes is good, she should 
be equally good at more elaborate ones. The same 
amount of application will serve for both. To make 
"plain" dishes palatable is, indeed, the highest 
test to which a woman can be put. The culinary 
skni demanded in these pages is of an everyday, 
common-sense character, such as any housewife, old 
or young, may exercise with pleasure. For these are 
chiefly specimens of the " good plain cookiag " which 
was done by our mothers, and grandmothers, and 
great-grandmothers — ^the old home cookery before 
tinned things and preservatives were invented. 
This book is, in its way, unique. 

In almost every family, at one time (before the 
present multiplication of printed cookery books) 



vi PREFACE 

there existed a manuscript recipe book, or collec- 
tion of old recipes tied together : passed on from 
one neighbour to another, or handed down from 
one generation to another as something really worth 
knowing. Some of these books and papers have 
been so frequently made use of, that they are almost 
worn out. The neat Itahan handwriting is nearly 
obhterated, the yellow edges of the paper are 
stained and discoloured with wear : it is difficult 
to decipher the often shaky speUing and quaint 
phraseology of the MSS. To collect and select such 
recipes, therefore, is no easy task, and one very 
seldom attempted. They are often so jealously 
guarded and treasured by their owners, that the 
mere permission to copy them has to be besought 
as a special favour. I have, however, attempted to 
bring together a fairly representative collection, and 
I am sure that among the nearly eleven hundred 
formulas here set forth, many a reader will recog- 
nise with dehght some little bit of cookery charac- 
teristic of her own old home, or will welcome with 
much satisfaction some long-lost method after whose 
ingredients she has frequently made search in vain. 
It will be seen that these are chiefly country 
dishes, dating back to the good old days when 
cities had not claimed the multitudes of the shires. 
Some, indeed, go back to the seventeenth century, 
when the disparity between town and country was 
not so great — ^when hardly a Londoner but had 
his garden, and cornfields separated the City from 



PREFACE vii 

the present West End. Where possible, I have 
indicated the origin of the recipe, or at least the 
county from which its possessor came. Should 
any reader care to perpetuate some cherished recipe 
not included here, I shall be most happy, if it be 
forwarded, to insert it in a future edition. 

The country meals are not as those of the town. 
A good hearty breakfast, about eight : a good 
hearty dinner about one : and that never-suffi- 
ciently-to-be-praised evening meal entitled " high 
tea," about six : this is the usual farmhouse routine. 
Sometimes, indeed, — as on Sunday, for instance, — a 
light supper about eight-thirty is substituted for 
high tea : but for the most part, people who go to 
rest early need no more than a cup of cocoa or some 
other hot beverage at bedtime. 

There is little doubt that " high tea " is a much 
more wholesome affair than late dinner. But, beyond 
this, it affords the opportunity for a vast variety of 
dishes, both salted and sweet, which do not easily 
come into the scope of any other meal : and, for 
this reason if no other, it is devoutly to be en- 
couraged. A Guildhall banquet can hardly vary 
the accepted and monotonous sequence of its 
courses : but " high tea " provides you with con- 
tinual surprises, unexpected tit-bits, appetising 
old- ashioned affairs. It obviates the use of alco- 
holic liquors : and is of aU meals the most sociable, 
friendly, and satisfactory. I wish some able author 
would arise and devote his talents to the offering 



viii PREFACE 

of A Plea for High Tea. A large number of these 
recipes would conduce to aid his eloquence. If only 
out of the hundred and fifty cakes here presented, 
he might vary the biU of fare perpetually : out of 
all the various cheese, egg, fish, and savoury made- 
dishes, it would be an interesting trial of skiU to 
select the evening's bill of fare. But the latter 
are equally useful to the town-dweUer, inasmuch 
that they are of large avail for luncheon or for 
Sunday supper. A glance at the list of contents 
win acquaint the reader with the very wide range 
here proffered for choice : and " right so," as the 
old authors would have expressed themselves, I 
commend this little book to aU and sundry.

SOME PRELIMINAEY REMAEKS 

Please read these attentively. They are most im- 
portant to the successful carrying-out of the recipes. 
Practised and expert cooks may regard them as 
" coals to Newcastle," but to less experienced women 
they will be of value : there is a moment in 
everybody's life when a thing is learned for the 
first time, and indeed, some of the following points 
are unknown to, or neglected by, cooks who profess 
themselves quite proficient. 

1. Let all hot foods be served upon hot dishes, with 
hot plates, and kept hot under a warmed cover. This 
rule is frequently ignored by people who consider 
they are good cooks, with the result that the most 
carefully prepared dish is spoiled. The simplest 
food served " hot-and-hot " is better than the most 
recherche one upon cold plates and dishes. If you 
can't heat your dishes, etc., in the oven or on the 
rack, put them in the fender, or dip them in hot 
water, or stand them on top of a boiling pan. But, 
by hook or crook, heat them. 

2. Vicer^oersa. Never serve cold foods upon luke- 
warm or just-washed plates and dishes. Be sure 

xU 



xlii SOME PRELIMINARY REMARKS 

that a cold preparation is cold : and if not, take 
means to make it so. Stand it out-of-doors, or in a 
bowl of cold water, or in a basin of wet silver-sand : 
but get it cold, not horridly tepid. 

3. Always allow a little more than the time allotted 
in a recipe, in arranging for the hour of a meal. 
Punctuality in serving a plain dish is better than 
a costly dish served late. As a rule, it is safe to 
allow at least a quarter of an hour per lb. for 
baking (plus a quarter of an hour extra " for the 
oven," i.e. before the meat starts cooking), and 
twenty minutes per lb. for boiling meat, with 
rather more for steaming ; it being remembered, 
in the former case, that no two range ovens are alike, 
and that it is very difficult to maintain the same 
degree of uniform heat for hours at a time (especi- 
ally as certain ovens are affected by certain winds) : 
and in the second case, that boiling, as regards meat, 
is not boiling but quiet simmering. Meat boiled 
is meat spoiled. All this must be taken into con- 
sideration in arranging a meal. Where a gas-stove 
is employed, the heat can, of course, be maintained 
at a more uniform temperature. Steaming is, in 
almost every case of meat and vegetables, superior 
to boiling. 

4. Always go by weight and measure : it is safer 
than " rule of thumb." The accurate balance of 
ingredients, especially as regards flavourings and 
seasonings, is one of the secrets of success : any 
deviation from it upsets the recipe. Lots of people 



SOME PRELIMINARY REMARKS xliii 

win not take the trouble to follow out the exact 
proportions defined, and then are astonished at the 
failure of their attempts. Occasionally, however, 
a recipe may be actually altered ; as, for instance, 
the next paragraph will show. 

5. In boiled suet puddings, the best rule (what- 
ever the recipe may say) is to use flour and bread- 
crumbs in equal quantities, or even in a larger 
proportion of crumbs than flour : never all flour. 
This ensures lightness. Suet should be grated rather 
than chopped : bread passed through a fine sieve, 
rather than grated. The cloth, if any, should be 
rinsed and wrung out in boiling water and well 
floured. Where a pudding is steamed, no cloth is 
required. 

6. Dried fruits should be quickly washed, and 
dried in a clean cloth, before using. It is surprising 
how they accumulate dust and grit. All whole 
Valencia raisins should be well stoned, and sultanas 
well picked. Bought "stoned" raisins are never 
so fresh and nice as whole ones. Currants should 
be scalded and then dried as above. Many persons 
are too lazy to do this properly. 

7. Never omit salt from the making of any so- 
called salted dish. Pepper is a matter of dis- 
cretion—but salt is a matter of necessity. This 
applies especially to vegetables, sauces, and gravies, 
where folks too often forget it. But also re- 
member to put a small pinch of salt into the making 
of every sweet dish — puddings, pies, cakes, custards, 



xliv SOME PRELIMINARY REMARKS 

etc. This is most important. It enhances and 
brings out the flavour in a marvellous manner. 

8. It is better to keep jams and all dry stores 
against an inside wall. They will gather mould or 
nuldew much sooner against an outer one. 

9. Never, if possible, omit that trifling touch of 
decoration which makes the simplest dish look 
appetising, and the homeliest table attractive. A 
few sprigs of parsley, with cold dishes, or with fish : 
a Httle cut lemon, and so forth, are an immense 
addition to the look of a dish. And a jar of flowers 
upon the table — ^the cheapest, the commonest 
flowers and leaves — makes aU the difference in the 
world. A meal then appears — ^without one's know- 
ing why — something more than merely eating to 
satisfy the wants of the body. It becomes a plea- 
sant and attractive affair, beneficial and tonic to 
the mind. 

10. Use up and make the best of what you have, 
before proceeding to purchase fresh material. But 
do not be penny-wise in the utilising of any scraps 
or remainders when they are evidently on the 
down-grade. Never let mere motives of economy 
tempt you to risk using anything which is in the 
least sour, stale, or tainted, especially as regards 
fish, stock, meat, or vegetables. Health is the first 
consideration of aU. 

Further practical hints will be found appended 
to the various sections. 



POSTSCRIPT 

The terms " spoonful," " cupful," etc., have been 
very loosely used by the original transcribers of 
these recipes. I have cleared up any doubt, to the 
best of my ability, by interpolating the (probable) 
correct amount. As a general rule it will be found 
that " spoonful " means tablespoon ftU, and " cup- 
ful," breakfastcupful ; but the reader must exercise 
her own discretion in two or three cases. 

Several local, provincial, or obsolete words seem 
to require interpretation. 

Barm and yeast are identical. 

To Cree (North-country) is to expand by slow 
cooking in water. To Plim is the South-country 
equivalent. 

To Coddle is to parboil. 

Earning is curdling-liquid, such as rennet. 

Farce is forcemeat or stuffing. 

Peeps are flower-petals. 

Pot may mean jar, pan, " crock," or " mug " 
(North-coimtry), or gallipot : according to the 
context. 

Sack may be modernised as very sweet white 
wine, — Sherry, Marsala, Madeira, etc. 

French wine usually indicates claret, and Lisbon 
vnne, port. 

A Tossing-pan is a frying-pan.

CHAPTER I 

BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 

Note. — To the housewife pretty nearly at the end 
of her resources, no less than to the hungry folk 
for whom she caters, several of the following sug- 
gestions will come with all the force of novelty. I 
have divided them, for purposes of the cook's 
convenience, into methods of treating hot meat and 
cold. We are only too apt to become stale and 
monotonous in our repetition, month by month and 
year by year, of certain too-familiar joints and 
rechauffes. But anything which can obUterate the 
memory of the horrid word " hash," should be as 
desirable as it is rare. Where stews are concerned 
(whether of fresh or cooked meat), I would like to 
remind the reader that anything baked iq earthen- 
ware is infinitely better cooked and better flavoured 
than it can ever be in a metal vessel. The earthen- 
ware retains and imparts heat and flavour in a most 
marvellous manner. And indeed, speaking gener- 
ally, I would say, steer clear of metal whenever and 
wherever you can, making use of wood and earthen- 
ware alone. Also, it is to be observed, that care- 
ful basting (too frequently ignored) is an essential 
point, not only in the cooking, but in the appearance 
of any baked or roasted meat.

2 BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 

FRESH MEAT 

1. BEEF COLLOP MINCED (Kent, 1809) 

Chop two pounds of beef very fine, taking from 
it every particle of fat and string ; put an onion 
shred small into a stewpan with pepper and salt 
and a piece of butter. Let them boil about a minute ; 
put in the meat and move it about with a 
spoon till it looks a little white ; then add a little 
good gravy and spice to your taste. Let it come 
to a boil, when it will be quite done enough. 

2. GALANTINE OF BEEF (Hertfordshire) 
Mince a quarter of a pound of beef and half a 
pound of bacon. Put both in a basin with six 
ounces of breadcrumbs, and pepper and salt. Beat 
two eggs and a gill of stock together and add to 
the other ingredients, and mix all well. Shape 
this into a nice roU, tie in a buttered pudding cloth, 
and boil for two hours ; turn out, let it set, and 
glaze it. 

3. ROLLED BEEF (Hertfordshire) 
A pound and a half of steak or gravy beef, 
four ounces of breadcrumbs, an ounce and a haK 
of chopped suet, one egg, seasoning to taste of 
parsley, thyme, salt, and pepper. The meat should 
be in one piece, and about half an inch thick. Put 
the meat on a board and flatten it with a roUing- 
pin. Mix all the dry ingredients after having 
chopped the parsley finely. Then add the beaten 
egg, or, if you wish to be very economical, a little 
milk. Spread the forcemeat over the beef, roll up. 



BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 3 

and tie into shape with tape or string. Put into a 
deep pie-dish. Pour over it three-quarters of a pint 
of boiling water, cover and stew in a slow oven for 
one and a half or two hours. Take out the meat, and 
put it on a dish. Mix smooth a tablespoonful of flour 
with cold water, add this to the gravy, place in a 
saucepan, and stir over the fire till the gravy is 
thick. Colour it with a little browning, pour over 
the meat, and serve. 

4. BEEF KIDNEYS A LA RUSSE (Hertfordshire) 
Soak some beef kidney in cold water for an hour, 
change the water once or twice as it colours. Then 
set it in a saucepan, cover it with cold water and 
bring to the boil ; draia off the water and add more, 
then simmer the kidney gently for fifteen minutes. 
Pour off the liquor and cut out the sinew, etc., from 
the kidney. Slice the meat thinly, dredge with 
seasoned flour, and fry in hot butter until brown. 
Take out the meat, stir in a tablespoonful of flour in 
the butter and brown thoroughly ; add a tablespoon- 
ful of tomato juice, and a little lemon juice, pepper 
and salt, and sufficient gravy to make enough 
sauce to cover the kidney. Place the meat in the 
sauce and cook all slowly for one hour, adding some 
gravy if necessary. Serve with fried croutons of 
bread, and tiny rolls of fried bacon. 

5. BEEF OLIVES (Cheshire) 
Take one and a half pounds of beef (steak for 
preference) and cut it into pieces four inches long, 
about the same in width, and half an inch thick. 
Mince up the trimmings and odds and ends of the 
beef, along with two ounces of suet, and one tea- 



4 BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 

spoonful each of parsley, thyme, and marjoram. 
Add three ounces of breadcrumbs, a grated lemon- 
rind, a little grated nutmeg, one beaten egg, and 
a pint of brown gravy, half a teaspoonful of salt, 
and a little pepper. When these ingredients are 
thoroughly united, beat out each piece of beef as 
flat as possible, and spread each piece with the 
above mixture : roll it up and tie it tightly. Place 
the rolls in a stew-pan with one pint seasoned brown 
gravy, and stew gently for three-quarters of an 
hour. Dish with a border of mashed potato or 
rice, and pour gravy round the ohves. 

6. FOR SPICED BEEF (Lancashire) 
(This is a very good and old recipe) 
To one gallon of boiling water add as much salt 
as will swim an egg, half an ounce saltpetre, half 
an ounce salt prunelle, half an ounce mustard seed, 
ditto of cloves, cayenne pods, ciimamon, mace ; 
one ounce of ginger, haK a pound of sugar (Deme- 
rara) ; all to be boiled together. The spices to be 
boiled in the water, and then the salt and sugar to be 
added when cold. The meat to be put in this pickle 
for several weeks. Keep turning. Silver side of 
beef or any part of round. 

7. STEWED RUMP OF BEEF (Eighteenth Centiuy) 

Half roast your beef, then put it in a large sauce- 
pan or cauldron, with two quarts of water, and one 
of red wine, two or three blades of mace, a shalot, 
a spoonful of lemon pickle, two of walnut ketchup, 
the same of browning, cayenne pepper and salt to 
your taste ; let it stew over a gentle fire, close covered 
for two hours ; then take up your beef, and lay it on 



BEEP AKD MUTTON RECIPES 5 

a deep dish, skim off the fat, and strain the gravy, 
and put in haM a pint of mushrooms ; t'Jcken your 
gravy, and pour it over your beef, lay round it 
forcemeat balls : garnish with horse radish, and 
serve it up. 

8. BROILED BEEF STEAKS (Eighteenth Century) 

Cut your steaks off a rump of beef about half an 
inch thick, let your fire be clear, rub your gridiron 
well with beef suet, when it is hot lay them on ; let 
them broil until they begin to brown, turn them, 
and, when the other side is brown, lay them on a 
hot dish, with a slice of butter betwixt every steak ; 
sprinkle a little pepper and salt over them, let them 
stand two or three minutes, then slice a shalot as 
thin as possible into a tablespoonful of water ; lay 
on your steaks again, keep turning them till they are 
done enough, put them on your dish, pour the shalot 
and water amongst them, and send them to the 
table. 

9. TO DRESS BEEF STEAKS THE COMMON WAY 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Pry your steaks in butter a good brown, then 
put in half a pint of water, an onion sliced, a spoon- 
ful of walnut ketchup, a little caper liquor, pepper 
and salt, cover them close with a dish and let them 
stew gently ; when they are done enough, thicken 
the gravy with flour and butter, and serve them up. 

10. MADRAS STEAK (Hertfordshire) 

Procure a good beef steak, dip it in flour, and 
place it in a baking tin, letting it lie flat, placing on 



6 BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 

the top slices of onions ; put greased paper over. 
Put in an oven and cook for twenty minutes ; mix 
together a teaspoonful of curry powder, a table- 
spoonful of vinegar in a cup of hot water, and add 
it to beef ; replace the lid and let stew gently for an 
hour and a haK ; serve very hot with onion on top 
and gravy poured round. 

11. STEWED STEAK (Sussex) 

Fry first with one shalot, then put it into a pan, 
with a little good gravy, a teaspoonful of made 
mustard, a very Httle cayenne pepper, and a little 
salt. Cover closely and let it cook gently for two 
and a half hours. Then add a httle browning, a 
little mushroom ketchup — or any other sauce — ladle 
the gravy over it and turn it once. 

12. BRAZILIAN STEW (Sussex) 

Take one pound of shin of beef, cut it into dice, 
dip the pieces into about two tablespoonfuls of 
vinegar. Stick one clove in an onion, take one 
carrot, one strip of celery, and add half a pint of 
water. Put the whole in a jar and cook slowly in 
a cool oven, or stand the jar in a saucepan of water. 

13. FRENCH STEW (Surrey) 

Cut into pieces two or three pounds of the lean 
of fresh, tender beef, veal, or pork ; peel and shce 
a quarter of a peck of ripe tomatoes : season the 
whole with a httle pepper and salt. Put all into a 
stewpot, and cover it close, opening it only occa- 
sionally to see how it is cooking. Put no water to 
the stew, the tomato-juice is enough liquid. When 



BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 7 

the tomatoes are all dissolved, stir in a piece of 
fresh butter dredged with flour, and the stew re- 
mains about a quarter of an hour longer. When the 
meat is done through, have ready some bits of very- 
dry toast, cut in three-corner shape, having the 
crust off. Dip the toast for a moment in some 
hot water, butter it, and stand it up round the 
inside of a deep dish. Fill in the stew and serve hot. 

14. LANCASTER STEW (Hertfordshire) 

Fry two large onions light brown ; mix a table- 
spoon of flour and fry it ; add a quart of thin stock 
or water, and a tablespoonful of vinegar. Cut two 
pounds of gravy beef or skirting into pieces, add 
them, let simmer for three hours ; an hour before 
serving drop in some savoury balls, made with half 
a pound of flour, teaspoonful of baking powder, the 
same of salt, half of pepper, parsley, thyme, half an 
onion chopped, three tablespoonfuls of suet, mixed 
with water. Dish the meat in centre with balls 
around. 

15. BOILED TONGUE (Eighteenth Century) 

If your tongue be a dry one, steep it in water aU 
night, then boil it three hours ; if you would have it 
to eat hot, stick it with cloves, rub it over with the 
yolk of an egg, strew over it bread crumbs, baste 
it with butter, set it before the fire till it is a light 
brown ; when you dish it up, pour a little brown 
gravy, or red wine sauce, mixed the same way as 
for venison ; lay shces of currant jeUy round it. 
N.B. — If it be a pickled one, only wash the water 
out of it.

VARIOUS 

16. CORNISH PASTY (West-country) 
Into half a pound of flour rub three ounces of lard 
or dripping, and a salt-spoonful of salt. Slice up 
finely about half a pound of uncooked potatoes, about 
half a pound of tender beefsteak cut into small 
pieces about two inches in length : add about two 
ounces of chopped onions. Make a paste with the 
flour and dripping, roll to about three-quarters of 
an inch thick, and cut it the size and shape of a 
dinner-plate. Lay the potatoes and meat on one 
half, and fold over the other half as for a jam 
"turn-over," moistening the edges with a httle 
water, and pinch them in all round. Bake in a 
moderate oven from half to three-quarters of an 
hour. 

17. MOCK GAME (Warwickshire) 
Required : beef steak, rashers of bacon, red currant 
jelly, lemon, vinegar, salt. Cut steak into strips, 
roll up each strip with a slice of bacon inside, tie 
each roll. Fry these lightly, put rolls into a sauce- 
pan containing one tablespoonful of vinegar, one 
teaspoonful of grated lemon rind, two tablespoonfuls 
of red currant jelly, three or four pepper-corns, 
and cloves and salt to taste. Stew until tender, 
place the rolls on a hot dish, thicken the liquid, 
add some good stock, pour this over the steak and 
serve, garnished with toast sippets and red currant 
jelly and parsley. 

18. STEWED OX TAILS (Devonshire) 
Cut two ox-tails into joints and fry them in 
butter. Place them in a quart of cold water, with 



BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 9 

a little onion, cloves, mace, lemon-peel, one table- 
spoonful of lemon-juice, and three sprigs of parsley ; 
let all simmer gently for three hours, then take the 
tails out and thicken the gravy with two or three 
tablespoonfuls of flour. Strain it through a sieve, 
season with pepper and salt ; place the tails in the 
gravy, and gently simmer for one hour more. Dish 
and serve with chopped parsley and toast. 

19. TRIPE (Stirrey) 
Take two pounds of fresh tripe, well cleaned and 
dressed. Cut the coarse fat away, and boil it for 
about half an hour in equal parts of mUk and water. 
The water should have been on the fire for half an 
hour previously, with four large, sliced (English) 
onions in. When the tripe is cooked, make the 
liquid into a rich onion sauce, and serve it very 
hot over the tripe. 

20. CURRIED TRIPE (Hertfordshire) 
Take two or three large onions, and fry them in 
dripping tUl tender. Chop them very fine, or, if 
preferred, pass through a sieve, and put them with 
a dessertspoonful of curry powder and peaflour 
mixed. When quite smooth, add gradually one 
pint of stock, and stir till it boUs. Now take 
one and a half pounds of boiled tripe, cut 
it into pieces about one inch square, and put it 
into the sauce. Let all stew together for one and 
a half hours. Have ready some well boUed rice, 
make a ball of it on the dish, pour the tripe into 
the centre and serve. Squeeze a little lemon juice 
over the whole. This dish is both economical and 
nutritious.

21. FRICASSEE OF TRIPE (Yorkshire, 1769) 
I 
Take the whitest seam tripes you can get, and cut 
them in long pieces, put them into a steAvpan with 
a little good gravy, a few breadcrumbs, a lump of 
butter, a little vinegar to your taste, and a little 
mustard if you like it. Shake it up all together with 
a little shredded parsley ; let it stew slowly till done. 
Garnish your dish with sippets. 

22. ANOTHER WAY 
II 

Take the whitest and thickest seam tripe, cut the 
white part in thin slices, put it into a stewpan with a 
little white gravy, lemon-juice, shredded lemon-peel, 
and a tablespoonful of white wine. Take the yolks 
of two or three eggs and beat them very well ; put 
to them a little thick cream, shredded parsley, and 
two or three (minced) chives if you have any. Shake 
it all together over the fire till it be as thick as cream, 
but don't let it boil for fear it curdle. Garnish with 
sippets, sHced lemon, or mushrooms. This will eat 
like chicken.

23. BASQUE OF MUTTON (Eighteenth Century) 
Take the caul of a leg of veal, lay it in a copper 
dish the size of a small punch bowl, take the lean of 
a leg of mutton that has been kept a week, chop 
it exceedingly small, take half its weight in beef 
marrow, the crumbs of a penny loaf, the yolks of 
four eggs, half a pint of red wine, the rind of 



BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 11 

haK a lemon grated ; mix it like sausage meat, 
and lay it in your caul in the inside of your dish, 
close up the caul, and bake it ia a quick oven; 
when it comes out, lay your dish upside down, and 
turn the whole out ; pour over it brown gravy and 
send it up with venison sauce in a boat. Garnish 
with pickles. 

24. ROLLED BREAST OF MUTTON (Hertfordshire) 
Take a breast of mutton, lay it on a board, and 
remove the bones. Trim it neatly, and remove some 
of the fat. Cover the side from which the bones 
have been removed with slices of ham, and then 
with a layer of meat stuffing, which has a flavouring 
of lemon grated. Quarter some pickled walnuts, 
and place them here and there on the forcemeat. 
Now roll the meat neatly and tightly, screwing 
the flap over. Bind it round with tape and roast 
it. The meat should be wrapped in caul or greased 
paper for the first hour it is in the roaster, and after- 
wards basted in the ordinary way. Place the 
mutton on a hot dish, remove the tape, and make 
a little good gravy. Strain it well, and stir it into 
a tablespoonful of red currant jelly, and pour it 
over and round the meat. Then take two table- 
spoonfuls of hghtly browned breadcrumbs, a tea- 
spoonful of mixed herbs, a quarter of a teaspoonful 
of pepper, half a teaspoonful of salt, and mix 
thoroughly. Sprinkle this over the meat and serve. 

25. THE BEST WAY TO COOK A CHOP (Essex) 
Place the chop in a colander and pour over it 
some boiling water. This seals up the tissues and 
does not allow any nutritious juices to be wasted. 



12 BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 

Now place it on a gridiron over a hot, clear fire, and 
cook in the usual manner. Turn with a knife, and 
do not prick in any way. Serve with a small piece 
of butter and a dust of pepper and salt. 

26. NAPLES CHOPS (Warwickshire) 
Take as many nice loin chops as you require for 
a dish ; trim away nearly all the fat, fry them 
lightly and place in a stewpan, dredging them 
quickly with browned flour. Cut in slices two or three 
large onions, season highly with black pepper, and 
fry to a golden brown ; scatter the onions over the 
chops, and pour in enough stock or water just to 
cover the meat. Have a pint of chestnuts boiled 
and peeled, lay them on the onions, place a cover 
on the stewpan, and cook the contents slowly for 
two hours. The onions and chestnuts will be cooked 
by the time the meat is tender. 

27. DEVILLED CUTLETS (Essex) 
One and a half pounds of nicely trimmed cutlets, 
two ounces of butter, quarter of a pint of cream, 
one teaspoonful of cornflour, one small teaspoonful 
of mustard, a good pinch of cayenne, two dessert- 
spoonfuls of Worcester sauce. Melt the butter in 
a frying pan, lay in the cutlets, which should be 
smartly trimmed, and fry hghtly till cooked. Take 
up the cutlets on a plate and keep hot. Put the 
cornflour, mustard, and cayenne into a basin, mix 
in the Worcester sauce gradually until smooth. Put 
the frying pan on the fire again, with the butter still 
in it in which the cutlets were fried. Add the 
cream and stir well together. Let it boil up ; now 



BEEF AND MUTTON EECIPES 13 

put in the Worcester sauce mixture. Stir well 
until it boils up and is quite smooth. Lay in the 
cutlets and let them stand at the side of the fire 
for two or three minutes until very hot through. 
Dish in two rows and pour the sauce over. If it be 
too thick before dishing, half a cup of milk with a 
small scrap of butter may be stirred in to thin it. 

28. HAGGIS (Scotland) 

Having washed a sheep's heart and hghts, parboil 
and mince them small, with a pound of suet and 
two large onions : add rather less than two handfuls 
of oatmeal, and season thoroughly with pepper 
and salt : mix all these articles well together, sew 
them up tightly in a bag, and boil for about three 
hours : serve with some good gravy, seasoned and 
thickened, or with sharp sauce. This is a cheap, 
but not a very dehcate dish. 

29. A HARICOT OF MUTTON OR LAMB 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Cut a neck or loin of mutton or lamb in nice cut- 
lets, and fry them a hght brown ; have ready some 
very good gravy made of the scrag of the mutton 
and some veal, with a piece of lean bacon and a few 
' capers ; season to your taste with pepper, salt, thyme, 
onions, which must be strained off, and added to 
the cutlets, just an hour before you send them to 
the table. Cook them on a slow fire, dish them up 
handsomely with turnips and carrots cut in small 
dice, with a good deal of gravy, thickened with a 
piece of butter roUed in flour ; if they are not tender 
they will not be good. Send them up very hot. 



14 BEEF AND MUTTON EECIPES 

30. ANOTHER WAY 
Take a neck of mutton and cut it into chops, 
flour them and put them into a stewpan, set them 
over the fire, and keep turning them till brown, 
then take them out, and put a little water into the 
same pan, and keep it stirring until brown over the 
fire, with a bunch of sweet herbs, a bay leaf, an 
onion, and what other spice you please ; boil them 
weU together, and then strain the broth through a 
sieve into an earthen pot by itself, and skim the 
fat off, which done, it is good gravy ; then add 
turnips and carrots, with two smaU onions, a little 
celery and other roots, then put the gravy to them, 
and as much water as wDl cover them ; keep it 
over a gentle fire till ready to serve up. 

31. HARICOT OF A LEG OF MUTTON 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Cut the best end of a leg of mutton into chops ia 
single ribs, flatten them, and fry a light brown ; then 
put them in a large saucepan, with two quarts of 
water, a large carrot cut in slices, cut at the edge 
like wheels ; when they have stewed for a quarter 
of an hour, put in two turnips cut in square shoes, 
the white part of a head of celery, two heads of 
cabbage lettuces fried, and cayenne to your taste ; 
boU them aU together till they are tender. The 
gravy is not to be thickened. Put into a tureen or 
soup dish. 

32. HARICOT MUTTON (Yorkshire) 
Two pounds of best end neck of mutton, one pint 
of warm water or stock, one ounce of dripping, 
one carrot, one turnip, one onion, half a table- 



BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 15 

spoonful flour, salt, and pepper. Cut the meat into 
small joints, remove all gristle and most of the fat, 
make the dripping quite hot and fry the meat 
quickly in it, and then place in another pan. Fry 
the sliced onion, add to the meat also the carrot 
and turnip cut in small squares. Simmer gently 
one and a haK to two hours, skim off any fat. Mix 
the flour with a little cold water, stir into the gravy, 
allow it to boU for a few minutes — then serve. 

33. POTTED HEAD (Scotland) 
Take half a sheep's head, removing the brains ; 
wash the head thoroughly and soak it for an hour 
or two in warm water ; then break it up and lay it 
in a pan with just sufficient water to cover it well ; 
bring to the boil, skim well, and simmer steadily, 
closely covered, till the bones will slip from the 
flesh. Now lift the meat out, remove the bones, cut 
into dice, seasoning it as you do so with the follow- 
ing mixture : two teaspoonfuls of salt, one of 
freshly ground black pepper, one of powdered all- 
spice, and if liked, a saltspoonful of cayenne. 
Return the meat to the pan, allow it to simmer 
uncovered for a few minutes, then pour it, with its 
liquor strained, into a wetted basin or mould, put- 
ting in with it the tongue, which should have been 
cooked separately, and leave till set. If liked, the 
liquor may be sharply boiled up to reduce it while 
the meat is being cut up. 

34 HODGE PODGE OF MUTTON 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Cut a neck or loin of mutton into steaks (i.e. 
chops or cutlets), take off all the fat, then put the 



16 BEEF AND MUTTON EECIPES 

steaks into a pitcher or jar, with lettuce, turnips, 
carrots, two cucumbers cut ia quarters, four or five 
onions, and pepper and salt ; you must not put any 
water to it; stop the pitcher very close, then set 
it in a pan of boiling water ; let it boil four hours. 
Keep the pan supplied with fresh boiling water 
as it wastes. 

36. HODGE PODGE (Kent, 1809) 
Take a quantity of shelled green peas, with onions, 
carrots, and turnips, and a sprinkling of salt and 
pepper. Put them into a pot with a lid, with a 
quantity of water corresponding to the quantity of 
soup wanted, containing a few mutton or lamb 
chops. Let the mess boil slowly, or simmer for 
five or six hours. 

36. HOT-POT (Essex) 
This should be made in a round deep pie-dish. 
Take two pounds of mutton chops, four sheep's 
kidneys, and one pound or more of peeled potatoes. 
Place alternate layers of the shced potatoes, chops, 
and kidneys, with shced onions, pepper, and salt, 
till the dish is full. If hked, oysters and anchovies 
may be added, and are a great improvement to the 
flavour of the hot-pot. Cover the top of the dish 
with whole potatoes, and pour over it a little water 
for gravy. Bake in a moderate oven for full three 
hours, and let the potatoes on the top be nicely 
browned. Fasten a serviette round the dish and 
serve very hot. 

37. KIDNEYS ON TOAST (Cheshire) 
Mince up some mutton kidneys very fine ; season 
with salt, pepper, and grated lemon-peel. Place 



•BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 17 

in a saucepan and toss the mixture in a little butter 
until very hot, then beat up an egg, stir well into 
the kidneys, and serve on thin slices of toast. 

38. LAMBS' TAIL PIE (Kent) 
This is a very old Kentish pie. In spring, when 
the lambs' tails are cut, these are collected. About 
half the tail, the thicker end, is used. It is flayed 
and jointed : generally about two dozen tails are 
used in making an ordinary-sized pie. Of course 
the crust is made in the usual way. 

(I have been told that the soft bones in the tails 
when cooked are like gelatine.) 

39. FORCED LEG OF MUTTON (Eighteenth Century) 
Raise the skin and take out the lean part of the 
mutton, chop it exceedingly fine, shred a bundle of 
sweet herbs, grate a penny loaf, and half a lemon, take 
nutmeg, pepper and salt to taste, make them into a 
forcemeat, but leave the bone and shank in their 
places, and it wiU appear like a whole leg ; lay it on 
an earthen dish, with a pint of red wine under it, and 
send it to the oven ; it will take two hours and a 
half ; when it comes out, take off aU the fat, strain 
the gravy over the mutton, lay round it hard yolks 
of eggs, and pickled mushrooms. Garnish with 
pickles and serve up. 

40. NAVARINE OF MUTTON (Hertfordshire) 
Take three pounds of neck or breast of mutton, 
trim it in neat pieces, sprinkle with flour, and fry 
in three ounces of butter ; pour off the liquid fat, 
and add a pint and a half of water, eight button 
onions previously fried, three sprigs of parsley, six 
2 



18 BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 

small turnips cut into olive shapes, a tablespoonful 
of tomato sauce, pepper, salt ; gradually bring to 
boiling point and take off the scum ; gently simmer 
an hour and a half. Pile on a dish with the vegetables 
round. 

41. MUTTON OLIVES (Hertfordshire) 
Take as many slices of cold mutton as required, 
have ready some good veal forcemeat, put a piece on 
one end of the mutton, roll it up securely, and tie 
with cotton. Place the rolls in a baking dish, pour 
good gravy over, cover tin with greased paper, and 
cook for half an hour ; serve with mashed potatoes 
and red currant jelly. 

42. MUTTON PATTIES WITH FINE HERBS 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Take part of the fillet from a loin or neck of 
mutton, and cut it in dice, with half the quantity 
of calves' udder, previously dressed. Put two 
ounces of butter in a stewpan, with a chopped 
shalot, parsley, six chopped mushrooms, salt, and 
pepper : let that heat over the fire a few minutes. 
Then mix the meat with it, and set the whole to cool. 
Line a dozen or more patty-pans with puff-paste ; 
fill them with the meat, and put on the cover, from 
the centre of which cut out a small piece the size 
of a wafer. Pinch the borders all round. Egg the 
patties, cut out another cover, with a still smaller 
hole : place this hghtly on the top : egg and bake 
them. When done, take them from the moulds, 
and fill them with an Italian sauce. Dish on a 
napkin and serve.

43. TO MAKE FRENCH STEAKS OF NECK OF 

MUTTON (Eighteenth Century) 

Let your mutton be very good and large, and cut 
off most part of the fat of the neck ; then cut the 
steaks two inches thick, make a large hole through 
the middle of the fleshy part of the steak with a 
penknife, and stuff it with a little nutmeg, pepper, 
and salt, mixed with the yolk of an egg : when they 
are stuffed, wrap them in writing-paper, and put 
them in a Dutch oven ; set them before the fire to 
broil, they wiU take near an hour ; put a little brown 
gravy in your dish, and serve them up in the papers. 

44. NECK OF MUTTON TO EAT LIKE VENISON 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Cut a large neck, before the shoulder is taken off, 
broader than usual, and the flap of the shoulder with 
it ; to make it look handsomer, stick your neck all 
over in little holes with a sharp penknife, and pour 
a bottle of red wine over it, and let it lie in the wine 
four or five days ; turn and rub it three or four times 
a day, then take it out, and hang it up for three days 
in the open air, out of the sun, and dry it often with 
a cloth, to keep it from musting ; when you roast 
it, baste it with the wine it was steeped in, if any 
left ; if not, fresh wine ; put white paper, three or four 
folds, to keep in the fat; roast it thoroughly, and 
take off the skin, and baste it nicely ; serve it up. 

45. SHOULDER OF MUTTON SURPRISED 
(Eighteenth Centtiry) 

Half broil a shoulder, then put it in a tossing 
pan, with two quarts of veal gravy, four ounces of 
rice, a teaspoonful of mushroom powder, a little 



20 BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 

beaten mace, and stew it an hour, or till the rice is 
cooked enough, then take up your mutton and keep 
it hot ; put to the rice half a pint of good cream, and 
a lump of butter rolled in flour, shake it well, and 
boU it a few minutes : garnish with barberries or 
pickles, and send it up. 



46. RAISED PIES (Yorkshire) 
Put two pounds of flour on the pasteboard, and 
put on the fire in a saucepan three-quarters of a 
pint of water and half a pound of good lard. When 
the water boils, make a hole in the middle of the 
flour, pour in the water by degrees, gently mixing 
the flour with it with a spoon. When it is well 
mixed, knead it with your hands till it becomes 
stiff. Dredge a little flour to prevent it sticking to 
the board, or you cannot make it look smooth. 
Do not roll with the rolling-pin, but roll it with 
your hands, about the thickness of a quart-pot : 
cut it into six pieces, leaving a little for the covers. 
Put one hand in the middle and keep the other close 
on the outside, till you have worked it either in an 
oval or a round shape. Have your meat ready cut 
and seasoned with pepper and salt : if pork, cut it 
in small slices, the griskin is the best for pasties. 
If you use mutton, cut it in very neat cutlets, and 
put them in the pies as you make them. Roll out 
the cover with the roUing-pin, just the size of the 
pie, wet it round the edge, put it on the pie and 
press together with your thumb and finger, and 
then cut all round with a pair of scissors quite 
even, and pinch them inside and out, and bake them 
an hour and a half. 



BEEF AND MUTTON EECIPES 21 

47. SQUAB PIE (Devonshire) 
Take a pie-dish, put at the bottom a layer of 
sliced apples, strew over them a little sugar, then 
a layer of fresh mutton (well seasoned with salt and 
pepper). Then another layer of apples. Peel 
some onions and slice them, lay them on the apples, 
then a layer of mutton, then apples and onions. 
Pour in a pint of water, cover all over with a good 
crust, and bake. 

48. SQUAB PIE (Kent) 
Take two pounds of the best end of the neck of 
mutton, cut it into small pieces, flavour with salt 
and pepper, and put a layer of it at the bottom of 
a pie-dish, next add a layer of sliced apples and 
onions, with about a dessertspoonful of brown sugar, 
then another layer of mutton. Cover with a good 
pie-crust, and bake as an ordinary meat pie. 

49. OXFORD JOHN (Eighteenth Century) 

Take a stale leg of mutton, cut it in as thin coUops 
as you possibly can, taking out all the fat sinews. 
Season them with mace, pepper, and salt, strew 
among them a little shred parsley, thyme, and two or 
three shalots. Put a good lump of butter in a stew- 
pan ; when it is hot put in all the coUops, keep 
stirring them with a wooden spoon till they are 
three parts done, then add half a pint of gravy and 
a little juice of lemon, thicken it with a little flour 
and butter, let them simmer four or five minutes and 
they will be quite done enough. If you let them boil, 
or have them ready before you want them, they 
will grow hard. Serve them up hot, with fried 
bread cut in slices over and around. 



22 BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 

60. BROILED MUTTON STEAKS (Eighteenth Century) 

Cut your steaks half an inch thick. When your 
gridiron is hot, rub it with fresh suet, lay on your 
steaks, keep turning them as quickly as possible. If 
you do not take care, the fat that drops from the 
steaks will smoke them. When they are done 
enough, put them into a hot dish, rub them well 
with butter, shce a shalot very thin into a spoonful 
of water, pour it on them with a spoonful of mush- 
room ketchup and salt ; serve them up hot. 

51. SHEEP'S HEAD (Cheshire) 

Steep two or three hours. SpUt the head ; take 
out the brains and tongue to boil separately. Boil 
the head gently for three hours with a carrot, 
onions, celery, sweet herbs, a few cloves, and pepper 
and salt ; egg and crumb and brown before the 
fire. Mince the lights, and serve the liver in sHces, 
well fried. Boil the brains in muslin, and arrange 
all together on one dish. 



COLD MEAT 

62. BEEF-CAKES (Cheshire) 
To each pound of cold roast beef, add a quarter 
of a pound of ham or bacon. Mince very finely, 
season with pepper, salt, and sweet herbs : add 
one or two eggs well whisked. Make into small 
square cakes about half an inch thick ; fry them 
in boiling dripping, drain, and serve with good 
gravy. 



BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 23 

63. BUBBLE AND SQUEAK (Essex) 

Either slices of cold boiled beef or cold roast beef 
can be used. Fry the slices of meat gently in a 
little fat, and arrange them nicely round a centre of 
fried greens : these should be boiled till tender, 
well drained, minced, and then placed in a frying 
pan with a little butter, a finely sliced onion, and 
seasoned with pepper and salt. When the onion is 
done, the greens are ready to serve. 

64. CURRY (Kent) 

Fry the meat in plenty of butter or fat, and 
plenty of onions — but do not let it be fried hard, 
then put it in a saucepan with a dessert-spoonful of 
curry-powder, some cayenne, a little vinegar, a 
little milk, some butter about the size of an egg, 
and thicken it with flour. Let it stew gently for 
several hours. This is very good. 

55. HUNTERS' PIE (Kent) 

Have a deep dish, and mince up very fine some 
underdone beef or mutton — a little fat must be put 
with it, but no skin, nor anything not to be eaten ; 
fill the dish three-parts full. Put some good stock 
made from bones and also any gravy from the beef 
that is to be had — season with pepper, salt, and a 
tablespoonful of ketchup. Put this into the oven 
to get warm, and then lay over a nice thick crust of 
moist mashed potatoes, or else finely grated bread- 
crumbs, and put little bits of butter on the top 
here and there. Bake slowly for an hour. 



24 BEEF AJSTD MUTTON RECIPES 

56. SOUFFLE OF LAMB (Essex) 
Half a pound of cold cooked mutton or lamb, 
one ounce of butter, one ounce of flour, half a pint 
of stock, one teaspoonful of chopped parsley, one 
tablespoonful of tomato sauce, two eggs. Trim 
away all skin, fat, and gristle, and pass the meat 
twice through a mincer to mince it finely. Melt the 
butter in a saucepan. Stir in the flour smoothly, 
add the stock, and stir until it boils. Put in the 
meat, parsley, tomato sauce, and season to taste. 
Take off the fire, and let it cool a little. Thoroughly 
stir in the yolks of eggs, and Kghtly stir the stiffly 
whipped white of egg through the mixture. Put 
into a buttered pie dish, or else divide the mixture 
into buttered pattypans. Shake a few crumbs over 
the top, and bake in the oven for ten to fifteen 
minutes. Serve at once. 

67. MACARONI WITH MEAT (Essex) 

Throw the macaroni in boiling water, and when 
it is soft strain it and put it into a pan with butter, 
turning it all the time, and not allowing it to get 
brown. Have ready some finely chopped onions 
and meat well seasoned and browned, then place a 
layer of macaroni and a layer of parmesan and a 
layer of minced meat till the tray or dish is full. 
Well beat up four eggs and add to the other ingre- 
dients. Make a sauce by placing a lump of butter 
on the fire and throwing a spoonful of flour over it, 
and then adding gradually a pint of milk. Pour this 
sauce over the macaroni, not forgetting to mix 
with it pepper and salt, nutmeg and cinnamon. 
Bake it in a dish that can come to table. It will 



BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 25 

take about forty minutes, and must not be too 
brown, or it will be hard. Before sending it to table, 
out the mixture into diamonds about two inches 
long. 

68. MEAT CAKE (Sussex) 
Mince half a pound of cold underdone meat, add 
two ounces of breadcrumbs, and the same of cooked 
rice — or macaroni cut small. Beat an egg into a 
cupful of gravy mixed with half an ounce of flour. 
Add salt, pepper, fried onions, a teaspoonful of celery 
sauce, a few tinned mushrooms, or anchovy sauce, 
or mixed pickles. Grease a cake tin, coat it well 
with bread crumbs, pack in close, cover with bread 
crumbs, and bake about an hour. 

69. MEAT SALADS (Essex) 
Any small scraps of meat or poultry, etc., should 
be cut up neatly and mixed with some cold cooked 
vegetables or salad ; place this mixture in small 
shells or cases, cover with mayonnaise sauce, and 
garnish with strips of boned and filleted anchovies. 

60. SCALLOPED MEAT (Hertfordshire) 
Take any remains of cold meat or sausages, mince 
all together, butter a flat dish, sprinkle it thickly 
with brown-bread crumbs ; lay the meat over them, 
and cover with crumbs ; put pieces of butter over 
it, and brown in the oven. 

61. COLD MEAT STEW (Sussex) 
Two pounds of cold meat in slices, one teaspoon- 
ful of red currant jelly, one mustard-spoonful of 



26 BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 

made mustard, one tablespoonful of ketchup, one 
dessertspoonful Worcester sauce, one small dessert- 
spoonful Harvey's, one glass of claret, to be all 
stewed together with some good stock, the meat put 
in, and all mixed well, and served very hot. 

62. MUTTON OLIVES (Devonshire) 
Required : Slices of cold roast mutton, veal stuff- 
ing, mashed potatoes, gravy. Take sUces of mutton, 
trim neatly ; dust one side of each with pepper, salt, 
and a little allspice. Put a small piece of stuffing 
on each and roll up, tying firmly with cotton. Place 
the rolls in a baking tin, pour some good gravy 
over, cover with greased paper, bake for half an 
hour. Make a mound of mashed potatoes on a 
dish, arrange the olives round, thicken the gravy 
and pour round. 

63. PILATF (Hertfordshire) 

Take three ounces of Patna rice, and pour over it 
half a pint of water and a tablespoonful of tomato

Put layers of meat, either cooked or uncooked, 
with alternate layers of potato and onion uncooked, 
in a deep bowl ; season with plenty of pepper and 



BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 27 

salt ; and fill up with water. Cover the whole with 
a good short crust, and bake in a slow oven. This 
is a very nice winter dish, and is much improved by 
adding oysters between the meat and vegetables. 

65. FORCEMEAT FOR PATTIES (Cheshire) 
Shred, or very finely mince, a little ham, cold 
veal, or fowl, beef-suet, and a Kttle onion, parsley, 
and lemon-peel. Add salt, nutmeg, pepper, mace, 
and breadcrumbs. (The respective quantities of 
all these will depend upon your requirements, your 
discretion, and the material in hand.) Pound all 
well together, add a little finely chopped thyme or 
marjoram, bind with a well-beaten egg, or two 
eggs if necessary. 

66. FORCEMEAT FOR PIES (Eighteenth Century) 
Take one and a half pounds of wild rabbits' flesh, 
and two pounds four ounces of fat bacon ; chop the 
whole, and pound it, with half an ounce herbaceous 
mixture, a Uttle salt, an egg, and two extra yolks. 

67. OBSERVATIONS ON MADE DISHES, ETC. 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Be careful the tossing-pan is well tinned, quite 
clean, and not gritty, and put every ingredient into 
your white sauce, and have it of a proper thick- 
ness and well boiled before you put in eggs and 
cream, for they wiU not add much to the thickness. 
Do not stir them with a spoon after they are in, nor 
set your pan on the fire, for the stuff will gather at 
the bottom, and be in lumps, but hold your pan a 
good height from the fire, and keep shaking the pan 
round one way, it will keep the sauce from curdling, 



28 BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES 

and be sure you do not let it boil. It is the best way 
to take up your meat, coUops, or hash, or any other 
kind of dish you are making, with a fish slice, and 
strain your sauce upon it ; for it is almost impossible 
to prevent little bits of meat from mixing with the 
sauce. By this method the sauce wiU look clear. 

In the brown made dishes, take special care no fat is 
on the top of the gravy, but skim it clean off, that 
it may be of a fine brown, and taste of no one thing in 
particular. If you use any wine, put it in some time 
before your dish is ready, to take off the rawness, 
for nothing can give a made dish a more disagreeable 
taste than raw wine or fresh anchovy. When you 
use fried forcemeat balls, put them on a sieve to 
drain the fat from them, and never let them boil iu 
your sauce, or it wiU give it a greasy look, and soften 
the balls ; the best way is to put them in after your 
meat is dished up. 



CHAPTER n 

PORK AND VEAL RECIPES 

Note. — These are mainly occupied with that most 
useful subject, cold meat cookery. Both pork and 
veal, unless carefully prepared, are apt to be even 
less digestible the second day of their appearance 
than the first. By skilful treatment, however, and 
a little extra trouble, they may be rechauffes in 
most attractive and innocuous ways. Those who 
are fortunate enough to possess their own pigs are 
acquainted with that vast variety of dishes which 
accrues upon the preparation of pork, etc., and to 
those I hardly need offer any reminder. As to the 
pigless person, he or she is 'prima facie debarred 
from the enjoyment of " lardy cake " and other 
such savoury foods. So I do not set down recipes 
for these : in either case they would be needless. 
The German " Roast Pork in Vinegar " and the 
Lancashire " Veal Cake " should specially be singled 
out for trial, but all the recipes are good. 

PORK 

68. BACON AND EGG PIE TO EAT COLD 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Steep a few thin slices of bacon in water to take 
out the salt, lay your bacon in the dish, beat eight 

29 



30 PORK AND VEAL RECIPES 

eggs with a pint of thick cream, put in it a little 
pepper and salt, and pour it on the bacon, lay over 
it a good cold paste, bake it in a moderate oven a 
day before you want it. 

69. TO MAKE BRAWN (Surrey) 
Having divided the head down the middle, re- 
move the brains, and cut off the ears, then let the 
head lie in cold water for twelve hours : boil it 
until the bones can be readily taken out, and when 
done, take off the skin as entire as possible : while 
the meat and the tongue are hot, chop them rather 
fine, and season with pepper, salt, a httle nutmeg, 
two or three cloves, and some cayenne : then place 
part of the skin at the bottom of a pan, lay on it 
the chopped meat, and put the rest of the skin over 
the top, place it mider a heavy weight, and let it 
remain until quite cold ; part of the hquor in which 
the head has been dressed must be boiled up with 
vinegar and salt, and thrown over the head. It is 
eaten with vinegar and mustard. (A little brown 
sugar added to these is an improvement. Ed). 

70. BRAWN (Essex) 
Procure a pig's head which has been in salt not 
more than three or four days, wash it and put it on 
in sufficient water to cover it well. Let it cook 
gently for about three hours, until quite tender, 
then take it out, remove the bones (which should 
come away easily) and cut up all the meat in small 
pieces, putting it into a basin, which should be 
kept hot over boiling water, or the brawn will set 
too soon. Season with pepper (no salt) and a little 
powdered mace and sage if liked ; put into a press- 



PORK AND VEAL EECIPES 31 

ing tin if one is at hand, and pour over the meat 
about half a pint of the liquor in which it has 
boiled. If a brawn tin is not to be had, use an 
ordinary large cake tiu, put a plate closely fitting 
on top, and set on that the heaviest weights you 
have — either scale-weights or flat-irons. 

71. BRAWN (Staffordshire) 
Take half a pig's head, with the tongue and two 
feet. Rub it all with salt and pepper and let it he a 
few days, rubbing well and turning every day. Then 
boil very gently until the meat comes easily off the 
bones. Take it out of the saucepan, put it on a 
board, and cut it all up into rather small pieces, 
then season with pepper and salt, and press it into 
a mould or proper brawn tin with holes at the 
bottom to let the gravy escape, and put a heavy 
weight on the top. Turn it out when cold, and 
send to table cold. 

72. TO BOIL A HAM (Eighteenth Century) 

Steep your ham all night in water, then boil it. 
If it be of a middle size it will take three hours 
boiling, and a small one two hours and a half ; when 
you take it up, pull off the skin, and smear it all over 
with beaten egg ; strew on bread crumbs, baste it with 
butter, set it to the fire till it be a Kght brown ; if 
it be to eat hot, garnish with carrots and serve it up. 

73. HAM CAKE (Essex) 

Mince finely one and a half pounds of cooked 
ham ; boil a sHce of bread in half a pint of milk, 
and mix this with the ham, beating them well 
together and binding them with a well-beaten 



32 PORK AND VEAL EECIPES 

egg. Have ready a wetted mould, pack the mix- 
ture into this, and bake for an hour in a very hot 
oven, by which time it should be nicely coloured ; 
then turn out, and serve either hot or cold. Rabbit 
or veal may be used in the same way. 

74. MINCED HAM (Isle of Wight) 
Mix half a pound of cracker crumbs with an equal 
quantity of finely minced lean boiled ham : moisten 
this mixture with stock, or water, and butter, add- 
ing salt to taste. Put the mixture in a baking tin, 
make depressions in it the size of an egg, and break 
an egg into each hollow. Bake a delicate brown 
in a good oven. 

75. PEPPER HAMS (Kent, 1809) 

One pound of bay salt, half a pound of common 
salt, two ounces of saltpetre and pepper pounded 
aU together very small ; rub the hams weU all over. 
Let them lie four days, rubbing them once a day 
then pour over them a pound of treacle, turn and 
rub them with the pickle three or four times a week 
for a month, then lay them in cold water twenty- 
four hours and hang them up to dry, after which 
they need not be steeped but put into cold water 
to boil. For hams from twelve to sixteen pounds 
each, three hours will be enough to boil them. 

76. TO POT HAM (Ireland) 

From the remains of a cold ham take a pound of 

the lean to half a pound of the fat, or a quarter of 

fat is enough. Mince it very fine, or run it through 

a machine. Add a small teaspoonful of pounded 



POEK AKD VEAL RECIPES 33 

mace, a quarter of a nutmeg, and salt, and, if pos- 
sible a little dry powdered bay leaf. Press this 
mixture down well in the pot or dish. Bake for 
about twenty-five minutes, taking care the top 
does not brown, and cover with melted lard, first 
pressing the ham. 

77. PIG'S CHEEK COLLARED (Surrey) 
Lay two pig's cheeks, with the tongue, in a dish, 
and strew it well over with salt and saltpetre ; let 
them stand for six days, and then boil them till 
the bones can be readily separated from the meat. 
Have ready a long strip of strong linen cloth, on 
which place the cheek, with the skin outwards, and 
on it the tongue, seasoning the whole highly with 
cayenne pepper, cloves, a very Httle mace, and 
salt ; roll it up firmly and boU it for two hours ; 
when done, set it under a heavy weight until cold, 
when the cloth must be removed. A cow-heel may 
be boUed, boned, and rolled up with it. 

78. PIG'S SHIN AND SAUSAGES (Sussex) 
Take a pig's shin, spread it all over with sausage- 
meat, roll up, tie tight, and boil. 

79. PORK CHEESE (French) 
Take out the bones from a pig's head without 
cutting the skin, remove the flesh, separate the 
fat from the lean, and cut the whole in strips ; do 
the same with the ears, and season the whole with 
salt, pepper, powdered nutmeg, and other spices, 
thyme, bay leaves, sage, and parsley, all chopped 
fine, the grated rind of a lemon, and its juice. Put 
the skin of the head into a salad bowl, and arrange 
3 



U PORK AND VEAL RECIPES 

in it the lean and the fat of the meat in alternate 
layers, as also two or three pigs' tongues cut up in 
the same way, with a little of the inner fat of the 
pig and some sliced truffles, if you have any : when 
all the meat is used, fold over the skin and sew it 
up, removing any superfluous part. Put this pre- 
paration into a stewpan of httle more than its own 
size, with carrots, sweet herbs, salt, and pepper, 
and moisten with a Httle white (French) wine ; 
simmer very gently for six or seven hours ; take it 
off the fire, and when merely warm put the head 
into a mould of the shape of a cheese, and so that 
a part of the head may be above the mould, and 
put a board over it covered with weights. This 
cheese is always eaten cold with mustard and 
vinegar. Pork cheese is also made with the ears 
and tongues alone, one layer of the ears cut into 
strips, and one layer of the tongues, seasoned as 
above, and piled together into a mould, to be 
pressed down in the same way as the head. The 
mode of proceeding is altogether the same as for 
the head, with the exception of enclosing it in a 
skin. 



80. PORK CHEESE (ItaUan) 

Mince and pound a pig's liver ; do the same, but 
separately, with a quantity of the inner fat of pork, 
equal in weight to that of the hver. Mix them 
together and season with salt, pepper, nutmeg, 
coriander, chopped parsley, thyme, and sage : 
cover the bottom and line the sides of a tin sauce- 
pan or shape with thin slices of larding, fill the 
mould and cover with larding : bake in an oven. 



PORK AND VEAL RECIPES 35 

When quite cold, dip the mould in boiling water 
and shake out the cheese. 

81. LEICESTERSHIRE PORK PIE 
Cut the pork in square pieces, fat and lean, 
about the size of a cobnut ; season with pepper and 
salt, and a small quantity of sage and thyme 
chopped fine, and set it aside in a dish in a cool 
place. Next make some hot paste, using for this 
purpose fresh-made, heated hog's lard instead of 
butter, in the proportion of eight ounces to the 
pound of flour. These pies must be raised by 
hand in the following manner : First mould the 
paste into a round ball upon the slab, then roU it 
out to the thickness of half-an-inch, and with the 
back of the right hand indent the centre in a circle, 
reaching to within three inches of the edge of the 
paste ; next, gather up the edges all round, press- 
ing it closely with the fingers and thumbs, so as to 
give it the form of a purse ; then continue to work 
upwards until the sides are raised sufficiently high ; 
the pie should now be placed on a baking sheet, 
with a round of buttered paper under it, and, after 
it has been filled with the pork previously prepared 
for the purpose, covered in with some of the paste 
in the usual manner. Trim the edges and pinch it 
round with the pincers, decorate it, egg it over, and 
bake till done, calculating the time it should remain 
in the oven according to the quantity of meat it 
contains. 

82. ROAST PORK IN VINEGAR (German) 
Take off the shin from your leg of pork, and do 
not leave too much fat either. Pour some vinegar, 



36 PORK AND VEAL RECIPES 

with cloves and onions, into a large earthen vessel ; 
rub your pork well with a handful of salt, and place 
it in the vinegar, where it naust remain three or 
four days and be frequently turned. If you like 
you can also stick a few cloves into it. Put your 
pork in the oven in the same vessel it has laia in, 
with all the vinegar about it. (This is extremely 
tasty and delicious. Ed.) 

83. BEOILED PORK STEAKS (Eighteenth Century) 
Observe the same directions as for mutton steaks 
(see No. 50), only pork requires more broiling ; when 
they are done enough, put in a little good gravy; 
a little sage rubbed very fine, strewed over them, 
gives them a fine taste. 

84. STUFFED PORK (Isle of Wight) 
Take two pounds of streaky green pork (the 
thinner the better), and one pound of sausage meat. 
Spread the sausage meat on the under side of the 
pork, covering one half ; now fold the other haK over, 
bind with strips of cahco, and boil. When cooked, 
press between two plates. This makes a good 
breakfast dish. 



85. SAVOUBY GOOSE (Sussex) 
Take half a pound of pig's liver, two onions, one 
pound of potatoes. Take a spoonful of flour mixed in 
water with salt, pepper, and a teaspoonful of minced 
sage. Cut the liver in thin shces and lay in a pie 
dish. Then put the potatoes partly cooked on top. 
Bake. 



PORK AND VEAL RECIPES 37 

86. EPPING SAUSAGES (Kent) 
Six pounds of young pork, quite free from skin, 
gristle, or fat. Cut it small, and beat it fine in a 
mortar. Chop six pounds beef suet very fine, with a 
handful of sage leaves. Spread the meat on a clean 
dresser, and shake the sage over it. Shred the rind 
of a lemon fine, and throw it with sweet herbs on 
the meat, two nutmegs grated, a spoonful of pepper, 
with a large spoonful of salt. Throw the suet 
over, and mix all well together. Put it down close 
in a pot, and when it is to be used, roll it up with 
as much egg as will make it smooth. 

87. OXFORD SAUSAGES 
One pound young pork, fat and lean, one pound 
beef suet, chopped fine together ; half a pound of 
grated bread, half the peel of a lemon grated, a 
nutmeg grated, six sage leaves chopped fine, one 
teaspoonful of pepper, and two of salt, and a little 
thyme, savory, and marjoram shred fine. Mix well 
together, and put it close down in a pan tUl used. 
Roll out the sausages, and fry in fresh butter, or 
broil over a clear fire, and serve up hot. 

VEAL

Well wash and clean the brains, then put them 
into a pan of boiling salted water shghtly acidu- 
lated with lemon juice, and let them cook over a 
slow fire for an hour ; lift them out, drain well, and

outlets the same way, but not roll them. 



44 PORK AND VEAL RECIPES 

106. SCOTCH OYSTERS (Yorkshire, 1769) 
Take two pounds of the thick part of a leg of veal, 
cut it in little bits clear from the skin, and put it in 
a marble mortar, then shred one pound of beef- 
suet and put to it, and beat them well together, 
till they be firm as paste. Put to this a handful 
of breadcrumbs and two or three eggs, season with 
mace, nutmeg, pepper, and salt, and work it well 
together. Take one part of this, about the size 
of a pigeon, and wrap it in pieces of the veal caul ; 
make the rest into little flat cakes and fry them. 
The roUs you may either broil in a dripping pan, or 
set them in the oven. There is enough for a good- 
sized dish ; lay them in the middle and set the 
cakes round. Take some strong gravy, shred in a 
few capers, and two or three mushrooms if you 
have any ; thicken it up with a lump of butter, 
and serve it up hot. Garnish your dish with pickles. 

107. COMMON VEAL PATTIES (Eighteenth Century) 
Take the kidney part of a very fat loin of veal, 
chop the kidney, veal, and fat very small aU to- 
gether, season it with mace, pepper, and salt, to your 
taste; raise little patties the size of a teacup, fill 
them with the meat, put thin lids on them, bake 
them very crisp ; five are enough for a side dish. 

108. SAVOURY VEAL PIE (Eighteenth Century) 

Cut a loin of veal into steaks, season it with 
beaten mace, nutmeg, pepper, and salt ; lay the 
meat in your dish, with sweetbreads seasoned 
with the meat, the yolks of six hard-boiled eggs, 
and half a pint of good gravy ; lay round your 



PORK AND VEAL RECIPES 45 

dish a good puff paste half an inch thick, and 
cover it with a lid the same thickness, bake it in a 
quick oven an hour and a quarter ; when you take 
it out of the oven, cut off the lid ; then cut the Hd 
in eight or ten pieces, and stick it round the inside 
of the rim, cover the meat with slices of lemon, and 
serve it up. 

109. STUFFED SHOULDER OF VEAL (Hertfordshire) 

Take the bone out, and fill the cavity left by it 
with veal stuffing ; then roll up the veal neatly, and 
tie round firmly with string. Place in a stewpan, 
with just enough water to cover. Allow to simmer 
slowly for four hours. Prepare two carrots, two 
onions, and some herbs, and stew with the joint. 
To serve take out the veal, remove the string, strain 
the gravy, thicken with flour and pour over the 
whole. Chop the vegetables finely for a garnish. 



VARIOUS 

110. COLD CURRY (Surrey) 
Four to six ounces of cold veal, chicken, or rabbit, 
one ounce butter, one sour apple, one large table- 
spoonful of curry powder, one good-sized onion, half 
a pint white stock (one that sets in a jelly), quarter 
of a pint of mUk, quarter of a pint of cream, a little 
lemon juice, salt, and pepper. Put the butter, 
apple and onions finely chopped, and curry powder, 
into a saucepan, and cook for twenty minutes ; then 
add the stock and milk. Simmer untU reduced 
to about a quarter of a pint, with saucepan un- 
covered. Put in the meat, cut into dice, and simmer 



46 PORK AND VEAL RECIPES 

for twenty minutes ; then put aside to cool. When 
cool, whip the cream and then stir in the mixture ; 
add salt, pepper, and a few drops of lemon juice, 
and put it in greased cases. Decorate with tomato, 
hard-boiled eggs and parsley. 

111. DRY CURRY (Hertfordshire) 

Put into a stewpan a quarter of a pound of 
butter, with two rather large onions cut small. Fry 
till light brown, then add two tablespoonfuls curry 
powder and a little salt. Have ready two pounds 
of veal, chicken, or rabbit, cut into small pieces, 
and add to the curry, and mix aU well together. 
Pour in one pint milk, and simmer slowly tiU the 
mixture is absorbed. It should take about an hour. 
Serve with rice. 

112. STUFFED LIVER (Isle of Wight) 

A calf's liver, and stuffing (sage and onions). 
Make an incision through the centre of the liver to the 
depth of half its thickness ; now put the knife into 
the opening and by holding it flat, cut round on each 
side. This will make a pocket to hold the stufiing. 
Bake in a hot oven, well basting with good dripping. 

113. MOCK SWEETBREADS (Cheshire) 
Take three-quarters of a poxmd of veal, pass it 

through a mincer two or three times till it is prac- 
tically a pulp : add a little suet or bacon very finely 
shredded or minced, the yolks of two eggs to bind, 
and a few fine breadcrumbs to give it consistency. 
Season with a little mace, pepper, and salt : add a 
httle cream or milk to moisten. Make up into the 



PORK AND VEAL RECIPES 47 

shape of sweetbreads, and brown in good (but not 
fierce) oven. Serve with gravy. 

H4. THATCHED-HOUSB PIE 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Take an earthenware dish that is pretty deep, rub 
the inside with two ounces of butter, then spread 
over it two ounces of vermicelli. Make a good 
puff paste, roll it pretty thick, and lay it on the 
dish ; take three or four pigeons, season them very 
well with pepper and salt, put a good lump of 
butter in them and lay them in the dish with the 
breasts down, put a thick lid over them, and 
bake it in a moderate oven. When done enough, take 
the dish you intend for it and turn the pie into it, 
upside down, and the vermicelli wUl appear like 
thatch, which gives it the name of a thatched-house 
pie. It is a pretty side or corner dish, for a large 
dinner, or bottom dish for supper. 



CHAPTER III 
FOWL AND GAME 

Note. — The manuscript-books of the last three 
centuries do not greatly trouble themselves over 
fowl and game : or, if they do, the recipes involve 
so lavish an expenditure of labour and material 
that they are out of place in these hard and 
hurried times. " Heron Pudding " is inserted as a 
culinary curiosity : for herons, like roast swans, 
roast peacocks, and other popular viands of the past, 
usually figure no longer upon our dinner- tables. 

The recipes for cooking rabbits will be found 
extremely useful : especially that entitled " Jugged 
Rabbit." As a more elaborate but very tasty dish, 
" Roman Pie " may be instanced. 

115. TO BOIL FOWLS (Eighteenth Century) 
When you have plucked your fowls, draw them 
at the rump, cut off the head, neck, and legs, take 
the breast bone very carefully out, skewer them 
with the end of their legs in the body, tie them round 
with a string, singe and dust them well with flour ; 
put them into a kettle of cold water, cover it close, 
set it on the fire ; when the scum begins to rise, take 
it off, put on your cover, and let them cook very 
slowly for twenty minutes ; take them off, cover them 

48 



FOWL AND GAME 49 

close, and the heat of the water will stew them 
enough in half an hour ; it keeps the skin whole, 
and they will be both whiter and plumper than if 
they had boiled fast ; when you take them up, 
drain them, pour over them white sauce, or melted 
butter. 

116. TO DRESS AN OLD FOWL (Cheshire) 
If for boiling, put it into lukewarm water with a 

piece of soda (bi-carbonate) about the size of a nut, 

and let it cook for the usual time. 

If for roasting, pour boiling water on it, and 

leave it soaking for nearly two hours in a jar on the 

stove. Then dry it well, and do not flour it, but 

put a little lard over it before cooking. 

117. FOWL SPATCHCOCKED WITH TARTARS 
SAUCE (Hertfordshire) 

Roast a fowl, take it up, split it down the back, 
arrange it, well fastened up with skewers, spread- 
eagle fashion ; griU over a good fire, place it on a hot 
dish with mushrooms round and serve with tartare 
sauce ; or make some white sauce, stir in two yolks 
of eggs well beaten up ; beat in some salad oil, then 
add tarragon, chervil, and enough vinegar to 
sharpen the sauce. 

118. STUFFED FOWLS (Seventeenth Century) 
Bone your fowls and fill them with the following 
forcemeat, and roast them. Take half a pound of 
beef suet, some finely minced mushrooms, a few 
sweet herbs and parsley shred fine, some grated 
lemon peel and nutmeg, pepper, and salt : six 
4 



50 FOWL AND GAME 

ounces fine bread-crumbs, an egg well beaten (two, 
if the egg be small). Have ready for sauce some 
good gravy with mushrooms. You may lard the 
fowls if you please. 

119. SALMI OF GROUSE WITH CLARET (Surrey) 
Cut up two roast grouse into members. Skin 
them, and throw the trimmings and skin into a 
stewpan, with two shced shalots, a few mushroom 
parings, a clove, half a blade of mace, a Httle 
allspice, and a few peppercorns. Let the whole 
sweat in a Httle consomme, at the corner of the 
stove. Add a pint of brown sauce, having boiled 
and clarified this, and two or three glasses of claret. 
Let the whole boil down rather thick, and strain 
it over the grouse. You may ornament the dish 
with a few pieces of toast. Blackcock or ptarmigan 
can be prepared the same way. These birds are 
better for keeping till the feathers come readily 
from the skin. 

120. JUGGED HARE (Yorkshire, 1769) 
Take a young hare, wash and wipe it well, cut the 
egs into two or three pieces, and all the other parts 
the same bigness. Beat them aU flat with a paste- 
pin, season with nutmeg and salt. Put them into 
a pitcher or any other closed jar, with half a poimd 
of butter. Set the jar in a pot of boiling water, 
cover it up close with a cloth or lid, and lay some 
weight upon it for fear it should fall to one side. 
It will take about two hours in stewing ; miad your 
pot be full of water and kept boiling all the time. 
When the hare is done, take the gravy from it, 
clear off the fat, and put the meat into the gravy 



FOWL AND GAME 51 

in a stewpan, with a tablespoonful or two of white 
wine, or a little lemon-juice, shred lemon-peel, and 
mace. You must thicken it up as you would a white 
fricassee. Garnish your dish with sippets of toast 
and lemon. 

121. JUGGED HARE (Surrey) 
Take a hare, skin it, draw it, cut it up, but do not 
wash it. Flour the pieces and fry them a good 
brown, in butter seasoned with salt and pepper. 
Have ready about one and a half pints of gravy, made 
from one and a haK pounds of gravy beef. Put 
the pieces of hare iato an earthenware jar, add one 
small onion stuck with five cloves, one lemon peeled 
and cut, and the gravy. Cover the jar closely, set 
it in a deep stewpan in cold water, and let the water 
boil three to four hours, according to the age of the 
hare. When it is done, take it out and set it over the 
fire iu a pan for a few minutes, and add one table- 
spoonful mushroom ketchup, two wine glasses of 
port, a piece of butter well floured, and some force- 
meat balls. 

122. BOASTED HARE (Eighteenth Century) 
Skewer your hare with the head upon one shoulder, 
the fore legs stuck into the ribs, the hind legs doubled. 
Make your pudding of the crumbs of a penny loaf, 
a quarter of a pound of beef marrow or suet, and a 
quarter of a pound of butter : shred the liver, a 
sprig or two of winter savoury, a little lemon-peel, 
a little cayenne pepper, half a nutmeg grated ; mix 
them up in a light forcemeat, with a glass of red 
wine and two eggs ; put it into the belly of your 
hare, sew it up. Put a quart of good milk in your 



52 FOWL AND GAME 

dripping-pan, baste your hare with it till it is reduced 
to half a gUl, then dust and baste it well with butter. 
If it be a large one it will require an hour and a half 
roasting. 

123. A HERON PUDDING (Kent) 
Before cooking it must be ascertained that no 
bones of the heron are broken. These bones are 
filled with a fishy fluid, which, if allowed to come in 
contact with the flesh, makes the whole bird taste of 
fish. This fluid, however, should be always extracted 
from the bones, and kept ia the medicine cupboard, 
for it is excellent applied to all sorts of cuts and 
cracks. The heron is first picked and fiayed. Then 
slices are cut from the breast and legs to make the 
pudding. The crust is made exactly like that of a 
meat pudding, and the slices of heron put in and 
seasoned exactly as meat would be. The pudding 
is boiled for several hours, according to its size. 
(I have been told that, as a matter of fact, it tastes 
very much like a nice meat pudding.) 

124. ROAST PARTRIDGES 
The Italian way (Seventeenth Century) 
Fill the partridges with butter worked with a 
little salt : cover them with slices of bacon fat and 
buttered paper : let them roast half or three-quarters 
of an hour. Let them drain, and serve them 
masked with an Italian sauce. 

125. ROLLED PARTRIDGES (Eighteenth Century) 
Having larded your partridges with ham or 
bacon, strew over them some pepper and salt, 



FOWL AND GAME 53 

powdered mace, shredded lemon peel, and sweet 
herbs cut small. Take some beefsteaks cut as thin 
as possible, but without holes in them, and strew 
some of the seasoning over them, then squeeze on 
some lemon juice. Lay a partridge on each steak, 
roll it up, and tie it round to keep it together. Set 
on a stewpan with some slices of bacon and an 
onion cut into pieces. Put the partridges carefully 
in, put to them some rich gravy, and let them stew 
gently till they are done. Then take them out of 
the beef, lay them in a dish, and strain the gravy 
over them. 

126. PILLAU (Cheshire) 

Spread a small baking-dish all over with rashers 
of bacon ; stick an onion with a dozen cloves ; cut 
a fowl in pieces, and rub it well with pepper and 
salt ; put the onion in the middle of the dish, and 
place the fowl over it. Have some rice boiled tender 
to fill the dish. Fill up with gravy. Cover with a 
water and flour paste ; bake about an hour ; take 
off the crust, and garnish with hard-boiled eggs 
cut in quarters, and sliced onions. 



127. TO BOIL RABBITS (1815) 

When you have cased (or drawn) your rabbits, 
skewer them with their heads straight up, the fore 
legs brought down, and their hind legs straight ; 
boil them three-quarters of an hour at least, then 
smother them with onion-sauce, made the same as 
for boiled ducks. Put a sprig of myrtle or bar- 
berries in their mouths, and serve them up. 



54 FOWL AND GAME 



128. FIVE RECIPES FOR COOKING RABBITS 

(Cheshire) 

GiBELOTTE 1. — Take a quarter of a pound of lean 
bacon, cut it in small dice, and fry it in a saucepan 
with a little butter for a few minutes. Put the 
bacon aside on a plate. Put the pieces of rabbit 
in the saucepan with a little more butter, and toss 
it about till the pieces are well set and begin to 
colour. Dredge in a Mttle flour, and stock, or wine 
and water (white or red) enough to cover it ; add 
salt, pepper, powdered spice, and sweet herbs, and 
let it simmer about a quarter of an hour. Mean- 
while toss a dozen small pickhng onions in a sauce- 
pan with a httle butter and sugar, till they are well 
coloured ; add them to the gibelotte with the 
bacon and a few button mushrooms. Let aU 
simmer twenty minutes or more ; take out the 
bundle of herbs, and serve. 

Gibelotte 2. — Toss the pieces of rabbit in butter 
till quite set ; sprinkle with shalot, parsley, thyme, 
and mushrooms, finely minced, pepper, and salt ; 
dredge a httle flour over, and moisten with stock 
(and white wine). Add the Uver, and let all simmer 
about twenty minutes or more. Take out the 
liver and pound it ; return it to the gibelotte, and 
serve, garnished with sippets fried in butter. 

Gibelotte 3. — Toss the pieces of rabbit with a 
little olive oil and a shalot ; pepper and salt ; add 
a httle thyme, and fry till the pieces begin to 
colour. Take them out one by one, and put them 
into another saucepan, with five or six table- 
spoonfuls of tomato sauce. Keep shaking the pan 



FOWL AND GAME 55 

till the rabbit is quite done, adding a little chopped 
parsley. This is a dry stew. 

GiBELOTTE 4. Curried. — Pry the pieces a light 
brown with shced onion and strips of bacon. When 
they begin to colour, add curry powder and flour, 
with stock and salt. Let all simmer gently. Serve 
with a wall of plain boiled rice round. Some add 
slices of apple. 

5. Rabbit and Onion Sauce. — Blanch the pieces 
of rabbit for ten minutes in boiling water. Put 
them into a saucepan with an onion stuck full 
of cloves, thyme, parsley, pepper, and salt. Cover 
with boiMng water. Let them simmer about three- 
quarters of an hour. Serve on a dish, piled, with 
plenty of onion sauce poured over them. 

129. TO FRICASSEE RABBITS BROWN 

(Eighteenth Century 

Cut up your rabbits, fry them in butter a Ught 
brown, put them in a tossing pan, with a pint 
of water, a teaspoonful of lemon pickle, a large 
teaspoonful of mushroom ketchup, the same of 
browning, a slice of lemon, cayenne pepper, and 
salt to your taste ; stew them over a slow fire 
till they are done enough ; thicken your gravy, 
and strain it ; dish up your rabbits, and pour the 
gravy over them. 

130. TO FRICASSEE RABBITS WHITE 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Cut up your rabbits as before, put them into a 
tossing pan, with a pint of veal gravy, a teaspoonful 
of lemon pickle, a sUce of lemon, a little beaten 



56 FOWL AND GAME 

mace, cayenne pepper, and salt, stew them over 
a slow fire ; when they are done enough, thicken 
your gravy with flour and butter, strain it, then 
add the yolks of two eggs, mixed with a large tea- 
cupful of thick cream, and a httle nutmeg grated 
in it ; do not let it boil, and serve it up. 

131. JUGGED RABBIT (Cheshire) 

Take a rabbit of two to three pounds, and out 
it up into joints. (An Ostend rabbit will be larger, 
but fatter : two wild rabbits will answer the same 
purpose, but will not have so much meat on.) Have 
an earthen stew-jar with a lid, and put the rabbit 
in, alternating each layer with a layer of thinly 
sliced onion. Season, as you go, with salt, pepper, 
and mace, mixed together with discretion. When 
the jar is nearly full, cover the meat with some five 
or six slices of thinly-cut bacon, and then add 
enough water to come nearly up to the bacon. 
Cover close with hd, and cook slowly in a good 
oven for two to three hours. Serve in the jar with 
a napkin round it. N.B. — This is extremely well- 
flavoured, but a trifle rich. 

132. ROASTED RABBITS (Eighteenth Century) 

When you have cased (or drawn) your rabbits, 
skewer their heads with their mouths upon their 
backs, stick their fore legs into their ribs, skewer 
the hind legs double, then make a pudding for them 
of the crumbs of a hahpenny loaf, a little parsley, 
sweet marjoram, thyme, a lemon peel, all shred 
fine, nutmeg, pepper, and salt to your taste, mix 
these up into a light stuffing, with a quarter of a 



FOWL AND GAME 57 

pound of butter, a little good cream, and two eggs ; 
put it iato the beUy and sew up. Dredge and baste 
the rabbits well with butter, roast them nearly an 
hour, serve them up with parsley and butter for 
sauce ; chop the livers, and lay them in heaps round 
the edge of your dish. 

133. A MADE DISH OF RABBITS' LIVERS 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Take six livers and chop them fine, with sweet 
herbs and the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs. Season 
with beaten spice and salt, and put in some plumped 
currants, and a little melted butter. Mix very well 
together and, having some paste ready roUed thin, 
make the mixture into little patties, and fry 
them. 



134. ROMAN PIE (Sussex) 

HaK a pound of puff paste, two ounces of 
macaroni, a small quantity of parmesan cheese, 
according to taste, and a small chicken, boned. 

Bone chicken, stew bones with gravy, make 
rich white sauce, season to taste with salt and 
mignonette. Cut white meat into smaU pieces, boil 
macaroni till quite tender and cut into two-inch 
lengths. Take a charlotte mould, first greasing 
same, and sprinkle with vermicelli. Line with puff 
paste, then add shces of white meat, then a sprink- 
ling of cheese and salt, then macaroni, doing this 
alternately. Then bake in a crisp oven one hour, 
when it should be golden brown. Turn out and 
serve with rich gravy and cheese. Rabbit or veal 
may be used also. 



58 FOWL AND GAME 

135. ROOK PIE (Eighteenth Century) 

Skin and draw six young rooks, and cut out the 
back bones ; season them well with pepper and salt, 
put them in a deep dish, with a quarter of a pint of 
water ; lay over them half a pound of butter, make 
a good puff paste, and cover the dish. Lay a paper 
over it, for it requires a good deal of baking. 



CHAPTER IV 

SOUP RECIPES 

Note. — We were never a soup-eating nation. The 
Englishman always desires to " get his teeth into " 
something solidly tangible ; and in nursery circles 
a damper is cast upon the dinner-table — a sense of 
being defrauded out of one's lawful dues — when 
soup, be it never so tasty, is produced. Even very 
thick soups — pea, and lentil, and those which are 
dense with rice, barley, sago, or macaroni — fail 
to restore equanimity. The common soups of 
our French neighbours — purely vegetable stock — 
economy of cabbage-water, and so forth, carried to 
its uttermost limit, would never appease the yearn- 
ings of those taught to reverence the Roast Beef of 
Old England. 

So I have not included very many soups : and 
I have perforce omitted some which began with so 
prodigious a boiling down of beef and mutton, that 
they would have befitted a giant's cuisine. The 
ordinary cookery book will supply you with many 
excellent suggestions for soup : but the hints which 
follow are useful and occasionally quite novel. 

It is advisable to keep a stock-pot in every house, 
if only for gravies : carefully straining oif all 
vegetable matter after the boUing, and re-boiling 
(not merely heating) the stock every day should the 

69 



60 SOUP RECIPES 

weather demand it. It is the falsest of false 
economy to use stock which is in the tiniest degree 
tainted. All bones should be well broken up before 
being put in ; and salt should be invariably added. 

136. ALMOND SOUP (Eighteenth Century) 
Take a neck of veal and the scrag end of a neck 
of mutton, chop them in small pieces, put them in a 
large tossing-pan, cut in a turnip, with a blade or 
two of mace, and five quarts of water ; set it over the 
fire, and let it boU gently till it is reduced to two 
quarts. Strain it through a hair sieve into a clear 
pot, then put in six ounces of almonds, blanched and 
beaten fine, half a pint of thick cream, and cayenne 
pepper to your taste. Have ready three small French 
rolls, the size of a small teacup ; if they are larger 
they will not look well, and will drink up too much 
of the soup ; blanch a few Jordan almonds, and 
cut them lengthways, stick them round the edge 
of the rolls, slantways, then stick them all over 
the top of the rolls, and put them in the tureen. 
When dished up, pour the soup upon the rolls ; 
these rolls look like a hedgehog. Some French 
cooks give this soup the name of Hedgehog Soup. 

137. A VERY GOOD WHITE ALMOND SOUP 
(Yorkshire, 1769) 

Take veal, fowl, or any other white meat, boiled 
down with a little mace (or other spice to your taste), 
let it boU to a mash, then strain off the gravy. Take 
some of the white fleshy part of the meat and rub 
it through a fine colander. Have ready two ounces 
of almonds, beaten fine, rub these through the 
colander, then put all into the gravy, set it on the 



SOUP RECIPES 61 

fire to thicken a little, and stir into it two or three 
tablespoonfuls of cream, and a little butter worked 
into flour. Have ready a crisped French roll for 
the middle, and slips of bread cut long like Savoy 
biscuits. Serve up hot. 

138. BARLEY BROTH (Kent, 1809) 
Put a quantity of barley with onions (and, if they 
can be got, carrots, and turnips), and a sprinkling 
of salt and pepper, into a pot having a lid, with a 
quantity of water equal to the quantity of broth 
required, sufficient to boU a neck of mutton, which 
should be put into it, and let the whole boil slowly 
for five or six hours. Duriag part of the time the 
mutton should be taken out, otherwise it will be 
over-boiled. In place of a neck, a flap of mutton 
may be used, and griUed after it is boiled. 

139. SHEEP'S HEAD BROTH (Kent, 1809) 
In Scotland an excellent broth, similar to the 
above is made of sheep's head, and sheep's feet. 
The head and feet are not skinned as in England, 
but the wool is singed off. It is a dish esteemed 
even at the tables of the rich, as barley broth and 
hodge-podge also are. The head, cold, eaten with 
vinegar and mustard, is exceUent eating, and is 
used at breakfast in many parts of that country. 

140. SPINACH BROTH (Seventeenth Century) 

Take strong stock, boU a piece of neck of mutton 

— four poimds or so, and a marrow bone in it. Then 

put in half a pound of French barley, a bundle of 

sweet herbs, two or three blades of large mace, and 



62 SOUP RECIPES 

let these boil well. Mince very small two large 
onions and half a peck of spinach. Add it to the 
broth, season to taste with salt, and let aU boU an 
hour or more. Serve the mutton and marrow bone 
in a separate dish with pieces of toast or fried bread. 

141. VEGETABLE BROTH (Kent, 1809) 
Is composed of greens or cabbage, shorn or cut 
into small pieces, onions, carrots, and turnips, or 
one or more of them as can be got, also cut into 
small pieces, with barley boiled slowly in a portion 
of water corresponding to the quantity of broth 
wanted, to which a sprinMing of salt and pepper is 
added ; a small quantity of dripping is also added, 
when that can be procured ; and vegetable broth, 
if properly made, is a nourishing and palatable 
food. 

142. CHESTNUT SOUP (Sussex) 
BoU the chestnuts tiU they burst open. Throw 
them into cold water, peel them, crush them into 
a paste (moistening with a little milk when de- 
sirable). Put them through a fine sieve. Set them 
in an earthenware pan with an onion already cooking 
in a little butter. Add a teaspoonful of sugar, a 
saltspoonful of salt, a little pepper, a light hint of 
spice, and as much mUk as will make up the required 
amount. Stir continually, and when it boils, add a 
spoonful of rice-flour, made smooth in cold milk, and 
a little cream if possible. 

143. EGG SOUP (Seventeenth Century) 
Having beaten the yolks of two eggs in a bowl, 
along with a piece of butter the size of an egg. 



SOUP RECIPES 63 

take a pan or kettle of boiling stock in one hand 
and a spoon in the other, and pour in by degrees 
about a quart of stock, and keep stirring it well 
all the time. When the eggs are well mixed and 
the butter melted, pour it into a saucepan and keep 
stirring till it begins to simmer. Take it off the 
fire and pour it from one vessel into another till 
it is quite smooth and has a good froth. Then 
put it on the fire again, keep stirring it until it is 
quite hot, and then pour it into your soup-dish.

Fry some onions a light brown in dripping at the 
bottom of a saucepan. Then put in one small table- 
spoonful of flour to each person, and stir with a 
wooden spoon over the fire until the flour is a pale 
brown colour, then add the hot stock (half a pint for 
each person) and stir until it is quite smooth and 
thick. Cut up very thin slices of cheese, put them

146. HARE SOUP (Eighteenth Century) 

Cut one large old hare in small pieces, and put it 
in a jar, with three blades of mace, a little salt, two 
large onions, half a pint of red wine, and three quarts 
of water ; bake it in a quick oven three hours, then 
strain it into a tossing-pan ; have ready boiled three 
ounces of French barley, or sago water ; scald the 
liver of the hare in boiling water two minutes ; run 
it through a hair sieve, with the back of a wooden 
spoon ; put it into the soup with the barley or sago 
and a quarter of a pound of butter ; set it over the 
fire, keep stirring it, but do not let it boil : if you 
do not like liver, put in crisped bread steeped in 
red wine. This is a rich soup, and proper for a 
large entertainment ; and where two soups are 
required, almond or onion soup may be used for 
the top and the hare soup for the bottom. 

147. LENTIL SOUP (Hertfordshire) 
To a quart of strong stock put about a cup of

152. ONION SOUP (Eighteenth Century) 

Boil eight or ten large Spanish onions in milk and 
water ; change it three times. When they are quite 
soft, rub them through a hair sieve. Cut an old cock 
in pieces and boil it for gravy, with one blade of 
mace ; strain it, and pour it upon the pulp of the 
onions, boil it gently with the crumb of an old 
penny loaf, grated into half a pint of cream ; add 
cayenne pepper and salt to your taste ; a few heads 
of asparagus or stewed spinach both make it eat 
well and look very pretty : grate a crust of brown 
bread round the edge of the dish. 

153. ONION SOUP (Kent, 1809) 
Take haK a pound of butter, put it in a stewpan 
on the fire, let it all melt. Let it boil till it has done 
making any noise, then have ready ten or twelve 
middling-sized onions, peeled and cut small, throw 
them into the butter, and let them fry a quarter of 
an hour ; shake in a little flour and stir them round, 
and let them cook a few minutes longer, then pour in 
a quart or three pints of boiling water, and stir 
well ; take a piece of upper crust of stale bread, 
about as big as the top of a penny loaf, cut small, and 
throw it in. Season it with salt to your taste, let it 
boil ten minutes, stirring it often, then tauke it off 
the fire, and have ready the yolks of two eggs beaten 
very fine with half a tablespoonful of vinegar ; mix 
some of your soup with them ; then stir the rest into 
your soup, and mix it weU and pour it into your tureen. 

154. BROWN ONION SOUP (Eighteenth Century) 

Skin and cut roundways in slices six large Spanish 
onions, fry them in butter till they are a nice brown 



SOUP RECIPES 67 

and very tender, then take them out, and lay them 
on a hair sieve to drain out the butter. When 
drained, put them in a pot, with five quarts of 
boiling water, boU them one hour and stir them 
often ; then add pepper and salt to your taste. Rub 
the crumbs of a penny loaf through a colander, put 
it to the soup, stir it well to keep it from being in 
lumps, and boil it two hours more. Ten minutes 
before you send it up, beat the yolks of two eggs 
with two dessertspoonfuls of vinegar and a little of 
the soup, pour it in by degrees, and keep stirring it all 
the time one way. Put in a few cloves if you choose. 
N.B. — It is a fine soup, and will keep three or four 
days. 

155. WHITE ONION SOUP 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Take thirty large onions, boil them in five quarts 
of water, with a knuckle of veal, a blade or two of 
mace, and a little whole pepper. When your onions 
are quite soft, take them up, and rub them through 
a hair sieve and work haH a pound of butter with a 
little flour into them. When the meat is boiled so as 
to leave the bone, strain the liquor over the onions, 
boil them gently for half an hour, serve up with a 
coffee-cup full of cream, and a little salt. Be sure 
you stir the soup when you put in the flour and 
butter, for fear of its burning. 

156. OX-CHEEK SOUP (Ireland) 
Put an ox-cheek into cold water in a tub to 
soak for a couple of hours, then break the bones, 
and wash it well in warm water ; put it into a soup- 
pot, and cover it with cold water. When it boils, 



68 SOUP RECIPES 

skim it very clean, and put in herbs, a head of 
celery, a turnip, carrots, two large onions, some 
pepper, allspice, and lemon, thyme, marjoram, and 
parsley. Cover the pot close, and let it boU slowly ; 
skim well ; simmer about three hours ; take out 
the head and let it boil slowly for about an hour. 
If you wish to thicken it, put two ounces of butter 
to melt in a pan, and then stir in as much flour as 
will dry it up ; brown it when well mixed together, 
and add it to the soup, stirring it well. Give it 
half an hour longer to boU. Strain it, if you wish, 
through a hair sieve. 

167. OX-CHEEK SOUP (Eighteenth Century) 
First break the bones of an ox-cheek, and wash it 
in many waters ; then lay it in warm water, and throw 
in a little salt to fetch out the slime ; wash it out 
very weU. Then take a large stewpan, put two 
ounces of butter at the bottom of the pan, and lay 
the flesh side of the cheek down ; add to it half a 
pound of shank of ham, cut in slices, and four heads 
of celery ; pull off the leaves, wash the heads clean, 
and cut them in with three large onions, two carrots, 
and one parsnip sliced, a few beets cut small, and 
three blades of mace ; set it over a moderate fire a 
quarter of an hour ; this draws the virtue from the 
roots, which gives a pleasant strength to the gravy. 
I have made a good gravy by this method with 
roots and butter only, adding a little browning to 
give it a pretty colour. When the head has simmered 
a quarter of an hour, put to it six quarts of water, 
and let it stew till it is reduced to two quarts. If you 
would have it like soup, strain and take out the 
meat and other ingredients, and put in the white 



SOUP RECIPES 69 

part of a head of celery cut in small pieces, with a 
little browning to make it a fine colour ; take two 
ounces of vermicelli, give it a scald in the soup, and 
put the top of a French roll in the middle of a tureen, 
and serve it up. 

If you would have it like stew, take up the cheek 
as whole as possible, and have ready, cut in square 
pieces, a boiled turnip and carrot, a slice of 
bread toasted and out in dice ; put in a little 
cayenne pepper, and strain the soup through a 
hair sieve upon the meat, carrot, turnip, and bread. 

158. PASSOVER BALLS FOR SOUP (Jewish) 
Chop an onion and half a pound of suet very 
finely, stew them together until the suet is melted, 
then pour it hot upon eight spoonfuls of biscuit 
flour : mix it well together : add a little salt, a 
httle grated nutmeg, lemon-peel, and ginger : add six 
beaten eggs : put the balls into the soup when it boils, 
and boil them for a quarter of an hour. The quan- 
tity of eggs and flour may appear disproportioned, 
but the flour employed is of a pecuKar kind, used 
for the purpose in Jewish families. Nothing can 
exceed the excellence of the balls made after this 
recipe ; they are applicable to any kind of soups. 

139. PEA SOUP (Essex) 
Four pints of water, one pint of dried peas, three 
onions, three carrots, two turnips, a bunch of 
herbs, sixpennyworth of beef bones (or stock from

70 SOUP RECIPES 

salt and pepper, skim well while boiling. Scrape 
the carrots, peel the turnips, skin the onions, cut 
them all in dice, add to the bones and peas, simmer 
very gently for four hours. Remove the bones, 
season with dried mint if liked, rub through a hair 
sieve if a puree is required. The water in which a 
joint of salt beef has been boiled, or one pint of 
bone or vegetable stock can be used instead of the 
bones. 

160. COMMON PEAS SOUP (Eighteenth Century) 
To one quart of split peas put four quarts of soft 
water, a little lean bacon, or roast-beef bones, with 
one head of celery ; cut it and put it in with a 
turnip, boil it till reduced to two quarts ; then 
work it through a colander with a wooden spoon; 
mix a little flour and water, and boil it weU in the 
soup, and slice in another head of celery, with cayenne 
pepper and salt to your taste. Cut a sUce of bread 
in small pieces, fry them a light brown, and put them 
in your dish ; then pour the soup upon it. 

161. GREEN PEA SOUP (Essex) 
Half a pint of shelled peas, one quart of the 
green shells, one and a half pints of water, two 
ounces of butter, one onion, two sprigs of mint, two 
lumps of sugar, half a pint of mUk, one teaspoonf ul of 
cornflour. Shell the peas, rinse the empty shells, 
and with a sharp knife remove the strings. Melt 
the butter in a very clean saucepan, put in the peas, 
the prepared shells, the onion sliced, and toss (to 
absorb the flavour of the butter) over a slow fire 
for a few minutes, hut do not brown. Then add the 
water, mint, sugar, and boil until tender. Rub all 



SOUP RECIPES 71 

through a hair sieve. Blend the cornflour smoothly 
with the milk. Put the soup back into the sauce- 
pan, add the milk and cornflour, and stir until it 
boils. Season and serve. Pried croutons of bread 
should be handed with this soup.

163. GREEN PEAS SOUP (Eighteenth Century) 
Shell a peck of peas and boil them in spring 
water tiU they are soft, then work them through a 
hair sieve ; take the water that your peas are boiled 
in, and put in a knuckle of veal, three slices of ham, 
and two carrots, a turnip, and a few beet leaves 
shred small, and add a little more water to the meat ; 
set it over the fire, and let it boil one hour and a 
half ; then strain the gravy into a bowl, and mix 
it with the pulp, and put in it a little juice of spinach, 
which must be beaten and squeezed through a cloth ; 
put in as much as will make it look a pretty colour, 
then give it a gentle boil, which wiU take off the 
taste of the spinach ; slice in the whitest part of a 
head of celery, put in a lump of sugar the size of a 
walnut. Take a slice of bread, and cut it in little 
pieces, cut a little bacon the same way, fry them 
a light brown in fresh butter ; cut a large cabbage- 
lettuce in slices, fry it after the other, put it in the 
tureen with the fried bread and bacon. Have ready

them in the soup, with a little chopped mint if you 
like it, and pour it into your tureen. 

164. GREEN PEAS SOUP WITHOUT MEAT 
(Eighteenth Century) 

In shelling your peas, separate the old ones from 
the young, and boil the old ones soft enough to 
strain through a colander ; then put the liquor and 
what you strained through to the young peas, which

large onion shred small, put them in a large sauce- 
pan, with near a pound of butter ; as they boil up, 
shake in some flour, then put in a French roU, fried 
in butter, to the soup. You must season it to your 
taste with salt and herbs ; when you have done so, 
add the young peas to it, which must be half boiled 
first. You may leave out the flour if you do not 
like it, and instead of it put in a little spinach and 
cabbage-lettuce, cut small, which must be first 
fried in butter and well mixed with the broth. 

165. POTATO SOUP (Essex) 
Two heads of celery, one carrot, one onion, one

large old fowl, a pound of lean bacon, and half a 
pound of rice, a few pepper-corns, two or three 
onions, a bundle of sweet herbs, and three or 
four heads of celery in slices. Stew all together

CHAPTER V 
FISH RECIPES 

Note. — Fish was very largely consumed in former 
days ; and it was, as a rule, so highly spiced and 
seasoned as almost (from our point of view) to swamp 
and destroy its flavour. Spices and condiments 
were indispensable to our forefathers ; and they 
would consider our modem treatment of fish in- 
sipid in the extreme. The days when herrings, 
dried or fresh, were the staple diet of the peasantry 
— when apprentices petitioned for special clauses 
in their indentures, that they should not be com- 
pelled to eat fresh salmon more than twice a week — 
are now so far beyond our ken as to be almost 
inconceivable. The following hints have been 
selected as those most feasible under present condi- 
tions, and largely deal with the utilisation of cold 
cooked fish — always a problem for the kitchen. 
Attention is especially directed to the easy and 
valuable recipe for preparing a " Finnan-Haddock," 
which, as usually cooked, is often a source of 
dyspepsia : to the excellent method for " Home- 
made Bloater Paste " ; and to " Sardine Sand- 
wiches." 

177. HOME MADE BLOATER PASTE (Yorkshire) 
Put six large herrings into boiling water for ten 
minutes, then cut off their heads, skin them, and 

77 



78 FISH RECIPES 

draw out all the bones. Beat them in a mortar, 
and add as follows : ten ounces of butter, three 
dessert-spoonfuls of anchovy sauce, cayenne and 
white pepper to taste. 

178. TO BAKE COD (Middlesex) 
The thickest part of the cod should be chosen for 
this dish, which is to be filled with a stuffing of 
grated bread crumbs, a bit of butter, the yolks of 
three hard-boiled eggs, pepper, salt, grated lemon 
peel and nutmeg, and an anchovy finely cut up, 
binding the whole with the white of egg beaten up : 
put the whole in a dish that will stand fire, with 
bits of butter over the top of it, and bake it in the 
oven for an hour. A Dutch oven is the best suited 
for this dish, as it requires to be frequently basted 
and turned : melted butter or oyster sauce may be 
served with it. 

179. TO DRESS A SALT COD 
(Eighteenth Century) 

Steep your salt fish in water all night, with a 
glass of vinegar ; it will fetch out the salt and make 
it eat like fresh fish. The next day boil it ; when it 
is done enough, puU it in flakes into your dish, then 
pour egg sauce over it, or parsnips boiled and beaten 
fine with butter and cream. Send it to the table 
on a hot-water plate, for it will soon grow cold. 

180. TO DRESS CODS' SOUNDS 
(Eighteenth Century) 

Steep your sounds as you do the salt cod, and 
boil them in a large quantity of milk and water ; 
when they are very tender and white, take them 



FISH RECIPES 79 

up and drain the water out, then pour the egg sauce 
boiling hot over them, and serve them up. 

181. FISH CAKES (Middlesex) 
Break up very fine any remains of cold fish, 
having carefully boned and skinned it. Pass 
through a sieve any cold potatoes, and mix an equal 
quantity of them with the fish. Moisten with any 
melted butter left over, or with a well-beaten egg, 
add a few bread crumbs to make the mixture firm. 
Season with pepper and salt. Make the mixture 
into balls or small round cakes. Roll in egg and 
bread crumbs, as for frying fish, and fry a hght 
brown. Garnish with parsley and lemon. 

182. TO CAVEACH FISH (Eighteenth Century) 
Cut your fish into pieces the thickness of your 
hand, season it with pepper and salt, let it lie an 
hour, dry it well with a cloth, flour it, and then fry 
it a fine brown in oU. BoU a sufficient quantity of 
vinegar, with a little garlic, mace, and pepper, to 
cover the fish ; add the same quantity of oU, and 
salt to your taste ; mix well the oil and vinegar, 
and when the fish and liquor is quite cold, sHce some 
onions to lay in the bottom of the pot, then a layer 
of fish, then onions, and so on tiU the whole fish is 
put up. The liquor must not be put in till it is 
quite cold. 

183. FISH CUSTARD (Surrey) 
Take any cold fish, remove all bones and skin, 
lay it in small pieces in the bottom of a pie-dish, 
with a little salt and pepper. Mix a dessertspoon- 
ful of flour smooth in a teacupful of milk, add one 



80 FISH EECIPES 

beaten egg, and a piece of butter about as big as 
a walnut, creamed but not oiled. Pour it over the 
fish, and bake half an hour or so in a moderate 
oven. 

184. FISH PIE (Cape Colony) 
Remove all skin and bone from any kind of fish 

(cooked) ; break into small pieces, mixed with miaced 
onion previously fried in butter ; add pepper, salt, 
and mustard, tomato sauce, half a well-beaten egg, 
and pack into a pie-dish. Cover with mashed 
potatoes, brush over with an egg. Bake for three- 
quarters of an hour. 

185. FISH PIE (Hertfordshire) 

Put three-quarters of a pint of mUk into a sauce- 
pan, with half a small onion, two cloves, a few thin 
strips of lemon peel, two or three pieces of 
parsley, and some salt and pepper, and let the milk 
simmer gently for twenty minutes. Make a paste 
in a saucepan with an ounce and a quarter of butter, 
and an ounce and a quarter of flour. Strain the 
milk and mix it gradually with the paste, thus 
making a thick sauce ; ascertain whether more 
pepper and salt is required, and add a teaspoonful 
of anchovy essence. Butter a pie dish, and place a 
layer of cooked fish which has been divided into 
flakes, in it, and cover it with some of the pre- 
pared sauce, a few shrimps, and a little chopped 
parsley ; then put more fish and the remainder of 
the sauce and some shrimps and parsley as before. 
Have in readiaess some smoothly mashed potato, 
which has been well seasoned with salt, pepper, and 
nutmeg, and mix with some milk, butter, and the yolk 



FISH RECIPES 81 

of an egg ; then beat it until it is light and creamy. 
Cover the fish with this, mark the top with a fork, 
and after pouring a small quantity of warm butter 
over the surface of the potato, bake the pie in a 
quick oven until it is evenly browned. 

186. FISH PIE (Ireland) 

Line the bottom and sides of a deep fireproof 
china dish evenly with vermicelli, which has been 
previously boiled in salt and water, well drained, and 
then tossed in a little melted butter. Have ready 
some fillets of sole or whiting. Brush each fillet 
on both sides with melted butter, then dip them in 
fine bread crumbs, nicely seasoned with finely- 
chopped parsley, pepper, and salt. Pill up the dish 
with the fillets in layers, pour over them a gill 
of thick tomato sauce : spread vermicelli over the 
top, sprinkle with bread crumbs and chopped par- 
sley, and put some small pieces of butter here and 
there. Bake in a steady oven half an hour, and 
serve in the dish in which it is cooked, garnished 
with parsley.

188. FISH PUDDING (Surrey) 
Take one pound and a half of cooked fish, half a 
teacupful of bread crumbs, two well-beaten eggs, 
half a teacupful of milk, one ounce melted butter, 
a little anchovy essence, a teaspoonful of chopped 
parsley, pepper, and salt. Break up the fish as 
finely as possible in a bowl, and add the rest — the 
eggs and mUk last. When all is well mixed put it 
in a buttered mould, and let it steam for three- 
quarters of an hour. For a baked fish pudding, 
use an equal amount of well-mashed potatoes, and 
about twice as much milk and butter as is men- 
tioned above. 

189. FISH AND POTATO PUDDING (Kent, 1809) 
Boil a quantity of potatoes, and bruise them like 
mashed potatoes. Mix with them a smaU portion 
of dried fish cut or grated very small, and a small 
quantity of dripping or butter. Put them into a 
tin dish, which may be put into a Dutch oven placed 
before the fire, until sufiiciently browned, or in a 
common oven where a cottager's family bakes bread. 
If a few boiled eggs cut into small pieces be mixed 
with the mashed potatoes, the dish is much im- 
proved. 

190. FISH SALAD (Devonshire) 
One pound of cold, cooked fish, one potato 
(mashed), one lettuce, two tablespoonfuls olive oil, 
one tablespoonful vinegar, one hard-boiled egg, one 
teaspoonful made mustard, one tablespoonful milk, 
one piece cooked beetroot, two pickled gherkins, 
parsley, salt, pepper, castor sugar. Break up the fish 



FISH RECIPES 83 

into small pieces, removing the skin and bones. Wash 
the lettuce, or endive, tear into small pieces, dry in 
a cloth. Mix the mashed potato with miLk ; stir 
into it oil and vinegar ; season with mustard, pepper, 
salt, and sugar. Mix well to produce a smooth 
dressing. Blend the salad with the fish, season with 
the dressing. Pile up on a dish or salad bowl. 
Garnish with shoes of beetroot, and serve. 

191. SCALLOPED FISH (Hampshire) 
Take any cold fish remaining from the previous 
day, carefully remove all skin and bones, and break 
it as small as possible with two silver forks (steel 
ones will injure the flavour). Mix into it any cold 
melted butter left over, or use half a pint of milk 
and two ounces of butter ; add bread crumbs to 
thicken it, and salt, pepper, and mace to taste. 
When all is well mixed, take some scallop-shells, 
or saucers, butter them well, and put in the mixture. 
Scoop a little hollow in the centre at the top, and 
put in a very small quantity of anchovy sauce 
Dust over with very fine bread crumbs, and drop 
some tiny bits of butter over. Bake in a moderate 
oven, and serve very hot. These will be found most 
savoury and appetising. A little chopped parsley 
may be added at discretion, and grated cheese 
may be dusted over along with the crumbs. 

192. A GOOD WAY TO STEW FISH 
(Eighteenth Century) 

Mix half a tumbler of wine with as much water as 
wiU cover the fish in the stewpan, and put in a little 
pepper and salt, three or four onions, a crust of 
bread toasted very brown, one anchovy, a good 



84 PISH RECIPES 

lump of butter, and set them over a gentle fire ; 
shake the stewpan now and then, that it may not 
burn. Just before you serve it up, pour your gravy 
into a saucepan, and thicken it with a little butter 
rolled in flour, a little ketchup, and walnut pickle ; 
beat well together till smooth, then pour it on your 
fish, and set it over the fire to heat, and serve it 
up hot. 

193. TO STEW FLOUNDERS, PLAICE, OR SOLES 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Half fry your fish a fine brown in three ounces of 
butter ; then take up your fish, and put to your 
butter a quart of water, and boil it slowly a quarter 
of an hour with two anchovies, and an onion sliced ; 
then put on your fish again, and stew them gently 
twenty minutes ; then take out your fish and 
thicken the sauce with butter and flour, and give 
it a boil ; then strain it through a hair sieve, over 
the fish, and send them up hot. N.B. — If you 
choose cockle or oyster liquor, put it in just before 
you thicken the sauce, or you may send oysters, 
cockles, or shrimps in a sauce-boat to table. 

194. FLOUNDERS WITH SORREL 
(Eighteenth Century) 

Gut and cleanse the flounders well, then slash them 
crossways, three cuts only on one side, and lay 
them in your saucepan. Put in as much water as 
will just cover them, with a Httle vinegar, salt, and 
one onion. Let them boil quickly. Then boil 
four handfuls of sorrel, pick off the stalks, and 
chop it very small. Add to this about haK a pound 



FISH RECIPES 85 

of melted butter, or more, according to the quan- 
tity of fish. Put it over your flounders, and serve 
away quick. 

195. TO BAKE HADDOCKS (Middlesex) 
Cut off the heads and fins of two or three had- 
docks, and put into a stewpan, with an onion, salt, 
pepper, and two anchovies cut up fine, a Httle flour, 
two tablespoonfuls of French white wine, and a 
Uttle ketchup. Boil this all well up together, and 
when the fish has been skinned and cut into pieces, 
lay them in a deep pie-dish ; pour the above sauce 
over them, and bake in an oven. Strew the bottom 
of the dish with bread crumbs, and strew some 
more over the fish, having seasoned them well with 
pepper and salt and a httle grated nutmeg. 

196. FINNAN HADDOCKS STEAMED (Surrey) 
Instead of boiling a finnan haddock the usual 

way, lay it in a deep basin or dish, and pour boiling 
water upon it to cover it completely. Cover it up close 
with a dish, lid, or thick cloth, and leave it for ten 
minutes. At the end of that time it will be better 
done, tenderer, and infinitely more digestible than 
if cooked the old way. Put on some butter, and 
a dash of pepper, and serve on a very hot dish. 

197. BAKED HERRINGS (Eighteenth Century) 
When you have cleaned your herrings, lay them 

on a board ; take a little black pepper, a few 
cloves, and a good deal of salt ; mix them together, 
then rub it all over the fish, lay them straight in 
a pot, cover them with alegar, tie a strong paper 



86 PISH EECIPES 

over the pot, and bake them in a moderate oven. 
If your alegar be good, they will keep two or three 
months. You may eat them either hot or cold. 

198. TO BOIL HERBINGS (Eighteenth Century) 
Scale, gut, and wash your herrings, dry them 
clean, and rub them over with a little vinegar and 
salt, skewer them with their tails in their mouths, 
lay them on your fish-plate. When your water boils 
put them in ; they will take ten or twelve minutes 
boUing. WTien you take them up, drain them over 
the water, then turn the heads into the middle of 
your dish, lay round them scraped horse-radish. 
Parsley and butter for sauce. 

199. FRIED HERRINGS (Eighteenth Century) 
Scale, wash, and dry your herrings weU ; lay them 
separately on a board, and set them to the fire two 
or three minutes before you want them, it wiU keep 
the fish from sticking to the pan ; dust them with 
flour. When your dripping or butter is boiling hot, 
put in your fish, a few at a time ; fry them over a 
brisk fire ; when you have fried them all, set the 
tails up one against another in the middle of the 
dish, then fry a large handful of parsley crisp, take 
it out before it loses its colour, lay it round them, 
and parsley sauce in a boat ; or, if you like onions 
better, fry them, lay some round your dish, and 
make onion sauce for them : or you may cut off the 
heads after they are fried, chop them, and put them 
into a saucepan, with ale, pepper, salt, and an 
anchovy, thicken it with flour and butter, strain 
it, and put it in a sauce-boat.

200. TO MARINATE HERRINGS (Middlesex) 

Clean the fish well without washing. Open them 
so as to remove the backbone, and season them 
well with salt, pepper, and onion chopped very 
fine. Roll them up tight, and place them in a jar, 
and pour over them some vinegar and water in 
equal quantities : tie over the jar with paper, and 
bake in a rather slow oven for an hour. When they 
are cold, pour over them a little cold vinegar. They 
may be pickled in the same way as mackerel. See 
Mackerel (No. 212). 

201. HERRINGS AND POTATOES (Essex) 

Wash, and boil some potatoes in their skins, 
carefully, so that they do not break or get too soft. 
Drain them, peel, and slice them rather thickly. 
Keep them hot. Fry lightly a chopped onion in 
one ounce of butter. Dust in some flour, and three 
tablespoonfuls of vinegar, salt and pepper, and a 
bay-leaf, and not quite a pint of water. Put the 
pan to simmer at the side of the stove. Take two 
red herrings, wash them well, cut them lengthways, 
and remove the bones. Cut up the flesh smaU, 
and let it simmer in the sauce for a few minutes. 
Put in the potatoes next, stirring carefuUy so as 
not to break them. Then add two ounces of butter 
and one gill of milk, and stir all well over the fire 
till it reaches boiling point. 

202. POTTED HERRINGS (Lancashire) 
Take six fresh herrings, wash, dry, and split them 
open, removing heads and backbones. Dust them 
with flour, pepper and salt, chopped parsley, or 



88 FISH EECIPES 

powdered mace. Roll them up tightly with a small 
piece of butter ia the centre of each. Place them 
in a pie dish, pour over them equal quantities of 
vinegar and water, but not to cover them. Cover 
the pie dish and bake in a slow oven, then re- 
move cover and let them brown a little. Two bay 
leaves may be put in the pie dish instead of mace. 

203. KEDGEREE (Essex) 

Boil two ounces of rice till tender and let it re- 
main till cold. Mix with it a teaspoonful of curry 
powder and some pepper and salt. Melt two 
ounces of butter in an enamelled saucepan, break 
two eggs into it and add the rice and stir until it is 
stiff, which wUl be in a few minutes. Have a large 
square of buttered toast ready on a hot dish, and 
pile the kedgeree on it. Sprinkle chopped parsley 
on the top, and serve very hot. The remains of a 
cold finnan haddock, removed from the bones and 
mixed with the kedgeree, makes a very palatable 
supper-dish. 

204. KEDGEREE (Kent) 

Boil two tablespoonfuls of rice, add any fish pre- 
viously cooked (salmon or turbot is best ); it should 
be well picked from the bone in shreds ; beat up 
an egg and stir it in just before serving, but don't 
let it boil after the egg is added. Serve with egg 
sauce. 

205. KEDGEREE (Sussex) 
Take half a pound of cold fish, break it into 
flakes, and remove all the bones. Then take three 
ounces of cold boiled rice, and two hard-boiled eggs ; 



FISH RECIPES 89 

cut the whites into dice and put them with the fish 
and rice into a saucepan, with one and a half ounces 
of butter, pepper, salt, and nutmeg. When well 
heated, put the kedgeree into a dish, and squeeze the 
yolks of eggs through a sieve over the top. Then 
put it into the oven to brown. 

206. BASHAWED LOBSTER (Cheshire) 

Take any remains of lobster and cut them up. 
Chop up a piece of onion about the size of a nut, 
and a little parsley. Mix all together with a little 
anchovy sauce and cayenne pepper. Cut up in 
small pieces a bit of butter and mix, and then put 
all into the shell of the lobster. Cover over the top 
with fine breadcrumbs, and butter and shake a 
few raspings on the top. Bake for about ten 
minutes, or a little more, and serve hot. 

207. LOBSTER FRITTERS (French) 
Chop up the meat, with the red part and the 
spawn, of two large lobsters, very fine, with finely 
grated crumbs of bread, add a little butter, and 
season with pepper and salt, and a very small quan- 
tity of chopped sweet herbs : make this into a kind 
of paste with yolk of egg, and having formed it 
into pieces about two inches in length and an inch 
thick, dip them into a good thick batter, and fry. 

208. SCALLOPED LOBSTER (Cheshire) 

Line your dish well with lobster (tinned or 

fresh) put some bread crumbs next, then lobster, 

and so on, alternately with little bits of butter, 

salt, and red pepper. Cover well with bread crumbs, 



90 FISH RECIPES 

and then put little bits of butter all over, and pour 
vinegar over all. Bake for about half an hour or 
more, or brown nicely before the fire. You can 
heat it up a second time, pouring in milk or gravy 
or anything to moisten. One tin of lobster makes 
two small dishes. Serve very hot. Excellent. 

209. BOILED MACKEREL (Eighteenth Century) 

Gut your mackerel and dry them carefully with 
a clean cloth, then rub them slightly over with a 
little vinegar, and lay them straight on your fish- 
plate (for turning them round often breaks them) 
into your fish-pan, and boU them gently fifteen 
minutes. Put a little salt in the water when it boils, 
then take them up and drain them well, and put the 
water that runs from them into a saucepan, with 
two teaspoonfuls of lemon pickle, one meatspoonful 
of walnut ketchup, the same of browning, a blade 
or two of mace, one anchovy, a slice of lemon ; boil 
them all together a quarter of an hour, then strain 
it through a hair sieve, and thicken it with flour 
and butter ; send it in a sauce-boat, and parsley 
sauce in another. Dish up your fish with the tails in 
the middle ; garnish it with scraped horse-radish 
and barberries. 

210. MACKEREL FARCED (Eighteenth Century) 

Take the roes out of four or six mackerel, fill 
them with a farce of whiting, confine the farce in 
them, and then marinate the fish in sweet oil, with 
a sUced onion, parsley, sweet herbs, pepper, and 
salt. Let them remain for two hours, then drain 
and broil them carefully over a slow fire, that they 



FISH RECIPES 91 

may be done carefully without scorching. Serve 
with a rich sauce over them. 

211. PICKLED MACKEREL (Essex) 

Six smallish mackerel, four bay leaves, four 
cloves, one level teaspoonful of peppercorns, one 
pint vinegar, thyme, parsley, fennel (if possible), 
salt, and pepper. Fillet the mackerel, wash and 
dry them, strew over them the herbs finely minced, 
and a little pepper and salt. Put in a dish with 
a httle butter, and bake till cooked. Try with a 
skewer and see if they are done. Boil the vinegar, 
bay leaves, cloves, and peppercorns together for ten 
minutes. Stir in a teaspoonful of extract of meat, 
and when cold, strain the liquor over the fish. Let 
it stand for several hours before serving, then drain, 
put on a clean dish, and garnish with parsley. 

212. TO PICKLE MACKEREL (Middlesex) 

Having cut and split the mackerel, cover them 
with a little thyme, parsley, and shalots, chopped 
fine : then fry the fish carefully : when done, pour 
over them some vinegar boiled with black pepper, 
a few cloves, and three or four bay leaves : this 
liquor is not to be poured upon them until it is cold. 

Another mode is to cut the fish into pieces, and to 
cover them well with a mixture of black pepper 
nutmeg, mace, and salt, reduced to a fine powder : 
then fry them brown in oil, and when cold put them 
into a jar, and fill it up with strong vinegar pre- 
viously boiled. If it is intended to keep them for 
some months before using, the top of the jar 
should have a depth of at least an inch of good 



92 FISH RECIPES 

sweet oil, and be carefully tied over with parchment. 
JThis is a rich preparation. The quantities of spices 
required for six common-sized mackerel are three 
nutmegs, six blades of mace, and an ounce of black 
pepper. A good handful of salt should be used. 

213. RED MULLET (Eighteenth Century) 
The red mullet is the only one worth using, the 
grey mullet being somewhat poor and coarse. 
Butter sheets of white paper, sprinkle them with a 
little salt. Clean the mullet, wipe them dry, and 
roll each in a separate paper. Broil (or bake) 
them, and send them to table in the papers, and 
serve with them a tureen of good melted butter 
or Italian sauce. 

214 FRIED PERCH OR TROUT (Eighteenth Century) 

When you have scaled, gutted, and washed your 
perch or trout, dry them well, then lay them separ- 
ately on a board before the fire for two miautes 
before you fry them. Dust them well with flour, and 
fry them a fine brown in roast dripping or rendered 
suet. Serve them up with melted butter and crisped 
parsley. 

215. PERCH IN WATER SOKEY (Eighteenth Century) 
Scale, gut, and wash your perch, put salt in your 
water : when it boils, put in the fish, with an onion 
cut in slices, a handful of parsley picked and washed 
clean and as much milk as will turn the water white ; 
when your fish are done enough, put them in a soup 
dish and pour a little of the water over them with 
the parsley and the onions, then serve them up with 



FISH EECIPES 93 

butter and parsley in a boat. Onions may be omitted 
if you please. You may boil trout the same way. 

216. SALMON IN BROTH (Seventeenth Century) 
Boil it in wine, water, and vinegar till it be 
tender, then put it into a piece of butter, which will 
soak into the fish. Take it out and lay it on a 
napkin, and eat it with vinegar : you may also 
make an excellent sauce to it with butter and 
anchovies. 

217. SALMON CUTLETS (American) 
Half a can of salmon mashed with a fork, one 
cup of hot mashed potatoes with salt and pepper 
to taste ; form into cutlets, dip in egg and bread 
crumb, and fry in deep lard, or in cooking oil. 

218. PICKLED SALMON (Essex) 
Boil the salmon in salted water, with two lumps 
of sugar and one gill of vinegar in it. Let it simmer 
until done. Then take it out and put into vinegar 
that has been well spiced with mixed pickling spice 
and a small piece of ginger. The vinegar must 
cover the fish. You can keep it thus until required. 

219. ROLLED SALMON (Eighteenth Century) 
Take a side of salmon ; when it is split, the bone 
taken out, and scalded, strew over the inside some 
pepper, salt, nutmeg, mace, a few chopped oysters, 
minced parsley, and bread crumbs. Roll it up 
tight, put it into a deep jar, and bake it in a quick 
oven. Pour a good Italian sauce over it before 
serving. 



94 FISH EECIPES 

220. SALMON STEAK WITH CUCUMBER (Yorkshire) 
Scale the fish and cut some slices about one and 
a half inches thick, and wipe them perfectly dry. 
AUow two ounces of good butter, the strained 
juice of a lemon, and a teaspoonful of white wine, to 
each pound of fish. Rub the bottom of a stewpan 
well with butter and lay in the fish, straining the 
lemon juice over it ; add a little salt. Lay over 
the fish a buttered paper, then put on the lid 
and allow twenty minutes for each pound of fish. 
When the fish is cooked, dish on a hot, dry dish. 
Garnish with little heaps of cucumber ; round it 
strain the gravy from the stewpan, through a 
tammy ; mix with it a tea-spoonful of finely 
chopped tarragon and chervil, and pour over fish. 

221. SALMON TIMBALES (American) 
Mash half a tin of salmon. Heat half a cup of 
cream, add three or four tablespoonfuls of butter. 
When the butter is melted, add salmon, salt, and 
pepper to taste. When taken from the fire add 
two eggs, then put it into buttered cups covered 
with buttered paper. Stand them in hot water in 
the oven for twenty minutes. 

222. TO CAVEACH SOLES (Eighteenth Century) 

Fry your soles either in oil or butter ; boil some 
vinegar with a little water, two or three blades of 
mace, a very few cloves, some black pepper, and a 
little salt ; let it stand till cold, and when cold beat 
up some oU with it ; lay your fish in a deep jar, and 
slice a good deal of shalots or onions between each 
fish ; throw your liquor over it, and pour some oU 



FISH EECIPES 95 

on the top. It will keep three or four months, thus 
made rich and fried in oil ; it must be stoppered well 
and kept in a dry place. Take out a little at a time 
when you use it. 



223. SOLOMON GUNDY TO EAT IN LENT 

(Yorkshire, 1769) 

Take five or six white herrings, lay them in water 
all night, boil them as soft as you would do for 
eating, and shift them in the boiling to take out 
the saltness. When they are boiled, take the fish 
from the bone, leaving on the head and taU, and 
mind you don't break the bones in pieces. Take 
the white part of the herrings, a quarter of a pound 
of anchovies, a large apple, a little onion or shalot 
shred fine, and a little lemon-peel. Shred them aU 
together, and mix them well, and lay them over 
the bones on both sides, in the shape of a herring. 
Then take off the peel of a lemon very thin, and 
cut in long bits, just so as it will reach over the 
herrings. You must lay this peel over every herring 
pretty thick. Garnish with a few pickled oysters, 
capers, and mushrooms, if you have any. 

224. BAKED SPRATS (Eighteenth Century) 

Rub your sprats with salt and pepper, and to every 
two pints of vinegar put one pint of red wine ; dis- 
solve a pennyworth of cochineal, lay your sprats in a 
deep earthen dish, pour in as much red wine, vinegar, 
and cochineal as will cover them, tie a paper over 
them ; set them in an oven aU night. They wUl eat 
well and keep for some time.

' 225. SARDINE SANDWICHES (Isle of Wight) 

Take a dozen good-sized sardines, carefully re- 
move the skin and backbone, and mash them up 
very fine with a fork. Add salt, pepper, and 
vinegar to taste, and mix it well in. Have thin 
white bread-and-butter cut, spread the mixture 
thinly over a slice, and cover it with another slice. 
When sufficient has been prepared, cut off the crust, 
cut the sandwiches diagonally into little three- 
cornered pieces not more than two and a half inches 
long by one and a half wide, and arrange them 
prettily upon a folded napkin with sprigs of parsley 
between. This is an enormous improvement upon 
the ordinary sardine sandwich, and excellent for 
afternoon tea, etc. Its only fault is that the sand- 
wiches, which take a good while to prepare, are 
eaten up so rapidly I 

226. CURRIED SARDINES (Kent) 

One box of sardines ; strain off the oil into a 
small frying-pan ; add to this a dessertspoonful of 
curry powder previously mixed with cold water. 
Thicken the oil with a little arrowroot, previously 
mixed with water. As soon as the curry and oil 
are about as thick as good melted butter, the 
sauce is ready. Pour this over the sardines, and 
place them in the oven long enough to get heated 
through. When quite hot, serve with pieces of 
toast. 

227. SARDINES ON TOAST (Cheshire) 

Divide the sardines lengthwise ; remove the 
bones, tail, and skin ; put them in the oven between 



PISH EECIPES 97 

two hot plates, with a Httle of the oil — let them be 
quite hot. Cut some thin strips of bread the 
length of the sardines, fry them in butter, and serve 
with half a sardine on each. Add a little cayenne 
and salt and a squeeze of lemon. Serve hot. 

228. SARDINE TOAST (Essex) 

Six sardines, two eggs, cayeime, buttered toast. 
Scale and bone the sardines, boil the eggs hard 
and chop them. Lay first the chopped egg on some 
hot buttered toast, then the sardines seasoned with 
cayenne, and put in the oven to get hot. 

229. TWICE LAID (Kent) 

Take remains of cold salt fish. Tear it into 
flakes ; mix it with double its quantity of mashed 
potatoes. Moisten with milk ; season with pepper 
and salt, roll into balls ; dip them in egg ; roU 
them in bread crumbs, and fry them brown. Drain 
and serve on a folded napkin. 



CHAPTER VI 

VEGETABLES AND VEGETARIAN 
DISHES 

Note. — Our great-grandmothers had probably never 
heard of vegetarian diet : our grandmothers and 
mothers encountered it in a much less acute form 
than what prevails to-day. Cooked vegetables, up 
to about the end of the seventeenth century, were 
held in small esteem, although the peasantry em- 
ployed them under the compulsion of Hobson's 
choice. Salad vegetables, uncooked, were largely 
used in preference. Both are now such staple 
articles of diet, that one can hardly conceive an 
adequate meal without them. Meanwhile, vege- 
tarianism, whether as a matter of medical order, 
fad, or conviction, is continually on the increase. 

The strict vegetarian of the twentieth century 
abstains, not only from fish, flesh, and fowl, and 
from all animal fats, however derived, but, I be- 
heve, in extreme cases, even from eggs and from 
milk. This renders his feeding very difficult to deal 
with, if he take his meals at home. For average 
vegetarianism, however, undertaken as a matter 
of expediency rather than conviction, there is a 
perfect wealth of choice. The main constituents of

VEGETABLES AND VEGETARIAN DISHES 99 

this embarras de richesse are vegetables and fruits 
(fresh, dried, or preserved), cereals and farinaceous 
foods of every kind, nut-foods, eggs, milk, butter, 
and cheese ad lib. The last article supplies that touch 
of tastiness (not to mention that amount of concen- 
trated nutriment) in which so many vegetarian 
dishes are conspicuously lacking. Among those 
which follow, will be found many excellent plata, 
tried and tested, which will serve to vary the 
monotony of plainer dishes : for it should always be 
remembered that the vegetarian must make up in 
bulk for the absence of meat, and monotony ought 
above all things to be avoided. Nut-foods, which 
are quite modern, find practically no place here ; 
but the vegetarian cook is referred to the respective 
sections upon Egg-Dishes, Cheese Recipes, Salads, 
Savouries, Puddings, Sweet Dishes, Jams, Pickles, 
and Sauces, from which she may increase her 
repertory. 

230. ARTICHOKES WITH CHEESE (Surrey) 
, Boil two pounds of Jerusalem artichokes, drain, 
and mash them up with one giU of milk. (Mashed 
cooked onions are an improvement : and yesterday's 
onion sauce is an admirable substitute for mUk.) 
Turn the mixture into a well-buttered baking dish, 
dust the top well with grated cheese, and bake till 
the top becomes coloured. 

231. BROAD WINDSOR BEANS PUDDING 
(Middlesex) 

Broad beans may be made into a pudding by 
pounding them in a mortar after boiling them and 
taking off the skins, then seasoning with salt and 



100 VEGETABLES AND VEGETAEIAN DISHES 

pepper, and a little butter, and tying them up in a 
cloth that has been floured and buttered. The 
pudding must be put into boiling water, and boiled 
for half an hour. When done, squeeze the water 
out by pressing the cloth, and take out the pudding, 
to which you can give any shape you please. Yolks 
of eggs beaten up, and the crumb of a roll soaked 
in cream, may be pounded with the beans to make 
a richer sort of pudding. This may be either 
boiled in a basin, or baked in an oven. 

232. CABBILOW (Kent, 1809) 
Mash boiled potatoes and boiled cabbages to- 
gether, mixing with them slices of onions, and 
sprinkling the mess with pepper and salt, to which 
should be added a little butter or dripping. The 
dish is improved by being put into a Dutch oven 
to be browned, like mashed potatoes. (See the 
Irish dish, Kailcannon, No. 241.) 

233. STUFFED CABBAGES (Middlesex) 
Take two good-sized cabbages, soak them for 
twenty minutes in scalding water and salt, then 
dip them in cold water, take out a portion of the 
centre, fill it with chopped veal and fat bacon 
seasoned with salt, pepper, and other spices, and 
made into a stuffing with eight yolks of eggs : then 
tie up the cabbage to keep in the stuffing. Put at 
the bottom of a saucepan some shoes of bacon, 
carrots, onions, and sweet herbs : over which place 
the cabbages, moistening them from time to time 
with good stock. Let the whole stew over a slow 
fire for at least an hour and a half, after which drain 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETARIAN DISHES 1 1 

the cabbages, press them a little, and serve them 
up, without the herbs with which they have been 
cooked, with Espagnole, or any other such sauce. 
Remove the strings before serving. 

234. CHESTNUTS AND BRUSSELS SPROUTS 
(Devonshire) 

Boil some chestnuts in water for two hours ; 
remove the peel. Boil an equal amount of Brussels 
sprouts for half an hour, strain them weU ; be care- 
ful not to break them. Have ready a frying-pan 
with hot beef dripping or butter, put in both chest- 
nuts and sprouts, and keep them moving until the 
fat is absorbed (do not brown them) ; then serve. 

235. CHESTNUT TEA CAKES (Surrey) 
Take some chestnuts, boil them tUl they burst, 
throw them into cold water and peel them. Pound 
them to a dry powder ; add an equal quantity of 
self-raising flour, butter, eggs, and sugar according 
to taste and quantity ; mix into a dough with milk, 
roll out and cut into small round cakes about half 
an inch thick, and bake in a brisk oven to a light 
golden-brown. 

236. CUCUMBERS WITH EGGS 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Take five large young cucumbers, pare, quarter, 
and cut them into slices, about the size of dice; 
put them into boiling water, let them boil up ; then 
take them out of the water, put them into a stew- 
pan, with an onion stuck with cloves, a good slice 
of ham, a quarter-pound of butter, and a little salt ; 



102 VEGETABLES AND VEGETAEIAN DISHES 

Bet this over a fire for a quarter of an hour, keep it 
close covered, skim it well, and shake it often, as it 
is apt to bum ; then dredge in a little flour, and 
put in as much gravy as will just cover the cucum- 
bers ; stir it well together, and keep a gentle 
fire under it tiU no scum wUl rise ; then take out 
the ham and onion, put in the yolks of two eggs 
beaten with a teacupful of good cream ; stir it well 
for a minute, then take it off the fire, and just 
before you put it in the dish, squeeze in a little lemon 
juice. Have ready five or six poached eggs to lay 
on the top. 

237. FRIED CUCUMBERS (Eighteenth Century) 

You must brown some butter in a pan, and pare 
and sUce (but not too thin) six middling cucumbers. 
Drain them from the water, then put them into the 
pan. When they are fried brown, put to them a 
httle pepper and salt, a lump of butter, a spoonful 
of vinegar, a little shredded onion, and a little gravy 
(not to make it too thin), and shake them well to- 
gether with a little fiour. You may lay these round 
your mutton as a sauce, or they are proper for a 
side-dish. 

238. DRIED HARICOT BEANS (Surrey) 

Wash the beans (quantity according to require- 
ments), and throw away all that float upon the 
water. Soak them for twelve hours at least (over- 
night for preference). Put them into cold water 
shghtly salted, bring slowly to the boil, and let them 
simmer very gently until quite tender. To improve 
the flavour, for one pint of beans add twelve ounces 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETAEIAN DISHES 103 

of onions, and a muslin bag of dried herbs : allow- 
ing three pints of water to boil them in. 

239. A HERB PIE FOR LENT (Eighteenth Century) 
Take lettuce, leeks, spinach, beets, and parsley, 
of each a handful, give them a boU, then chop them 
small. Have ready boiled in a cloth one quart 
of groats, with two or three onions in them ; put 
them in a frying-pan with the herbs and a good deal 
of salt, half a pound of butter, and a few apples cut 
thin ; stew them a few minutes over the fire, fill your 
dish or raised crust with it ; one hour will bake it. 

240. HOT POT (Vegetable) (Ireland) 
One pound of potatoes, one pound of onions, 
half a pound of good cheese. Slice potatoes, ditto 
onions, ditto cheese, and fry them separately. Then 
line a dish with potato and fill in with onions 
mixed with cheese, pepper, salt, and sage. Cover 
with the potato to form crust. Bake. To be eaten 
very hot. If left, the cheese will get hard. 

241. KAILCANNON (Ireland) 

Take some well-boiled potatoes, mash them 
thoroughly, addiag pepper, salt, and a small piece 
of butter. Then take a rather less quantity of 
boiled and chopped greens, or green cabbage, with 
a little fine chopped onion, mix well, and serve very 
hot. It can be served in a shape. 

242. BOILED LETTUCES (Middlesex) 
Wash and put them into boiling water, with a 
little salt, let them boil until tender ; strain them 



104 VEGETABLES AND VEGETAKIAN DISHES 

in a colander, and chop them up ; then put them 
into a saucepan with some fresh butter, a spoonful 
of flour, a little nutmeg, salt, and the juice of a 
lemon ; let the whole boil for a quarter of an hour. 
This may be varied by omitting the lemon juice, 
adding some good cream, and thickening with the 
yolks of two eggs. (This is an excellent plan where 
lettuces are " bolted " and unsuitable for serving 
cold. Ed.) 

243. STUFFED LETTUCES (Middlesex) 

Choose some large cabbage lettuces, and having 
boiled them a quarter of an hour, dip them into cold 
water and let them drain ; then open the leaves 
without breaking them, and fill the centre part with 
a good forcemeat, and tie them up ; stew them for 
a short time, then drain them on a cloth, dip them 
in a batter, and fry to a good colour. When done, 
cover them with bread crumbs, and serve with some 
white sauce. 

244 MACARONI RISSOLES (Kent) 

Take one teacupful of butter beans, which have 
been boiled till they are quite soft, half a teacupful 
of boiled macaroni, half a teacupful of cold mashed 
potatoes, the yolks of two eggs, pepper and salt, 
half a teacupful of brown bread crumbs — that is to 
say, the crumbs of bread which has been browned 
and dried in the oven. Cut the macaroni up into 
small pieces ; mash the beans and potatoes ; mix 
all together with half the quantity of breadcrumbs, 
bind them with the yolk of the egg, and shape them 
into small balls. Roll the balls in bread crumbs, 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETAEIAN DISHES 105 

fry them a deep golden brown, and serve very hot. 
They are very nice with bacon at breakfast, or they 
will take the place of a vegetable at lunch-time. 

245. MACARONI WITH TOMATOES (Kent) 
Boil a quarter of a pound of pipe macaroni in 
water till tender ; turn it out on to a dish, add pepper 
and salt, garnish with fresh tomatoes that have been 
baked in the oven with a little butter. Shake over 
the whole some grated Parmesan cheese, and serve 
very hot. It should have a light, cobwebby appear- 
ance, which is obtained by the cheese being dredged 
in while the macaroni is very hot, and therefore 
melting quickly. 

246. MAIZE (American) 

Strip the grain from the young cob, boil it like 
peas : drain it, toss in some melted butter, salt, 
and pepper, and serve very hot, sprinkled with 
chopped parsley. When green maize is not pro- 
curable (though it can easily be grown as a gar- 
den vegetable) the tinned preparations called 
Succotash, and Wyndham Corn, though not so 
cheap, make useful dishes, and supply a change 
from the more hackneyed vegetables. 

247. BAKED MUSHROOMS (Surrey) 
Carefully peel the mushrooms, and put them, 
hoUow-side uppermost, on a buttered baking-sheet ; 
fill the cavities with butter, and set in a moderately 
hot oven. They should be ready in about twelve 
minutes. It will be seen that they must be fairly 
whole mushrooms, not stale or broken ones. 



106 VEGETABLE SAND VEGETARIAN DISHES 

248. FRICASSEED MUSHROOMS (Eighteenth Century) 

Peel and scrape the inside of the mushrooms, 
throw them into salt and water ; if buttons, rub them 
with flannel ; take them and boil them with fresh 
salt and water. When they are tender, put in a little 
shredded parsley, and an onion stuck with cloves, and 
toss them up with a good lump of butter rolled in 
flour. You may put in three spoonfuls of thick cream, 
and a little nutmeg cut in pieces, but take care to 
take out the nutmeg and onion before you serve it 
at the table. You may leave out the parsley, and 
add a glass of wine if you like. 

249. MUSHROOMS AU GRATIN (Ireland) 

Take eight or ten large cup mushrooms. Cut off 
all the stalks and peel them, and also peel very care- 
fully the cup-hke part of the mushroom, so as not 
to hurt the rim. Next scoop out the inside of these 
cups, and chop it up with the stalk of the mush- 
rooms. Take a piece of shalot about as big as a 
large nut, and a teaspoonful of chopped parsley, 
and a very little chopped thyme, with a little cayenne 
pepper. Add about three ounces of scraped bacon, 
fat and lean. Put all over the flre, and fry for a 
time. If the mass is too dry, it shows there is not 
enough bacon-fat ; if it be too moist, add bread- 
crumbs. Fill the cups of the mushrooms with this 
mixture, and shake over some fine bread-raspings. 
Place the cups so prepared in a covered stewpan, 
with some butter or oil, and let them cook very 
gently till the cup part of the mushroom is quite 
tender. Serve hot, with toast, either plain, or with 
some rich brown gravy poured round them. 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETARIAN DISHES 107 

260. SCALLOPED MUSHROOMS (Middlesex) 

Put the mushrooms mto a saucepan with fresh 
butter, chopped parsley, shalots, and a few mush- 
rooms, also chopped up ; moisten them from time 
to time, with a little butter and water, mixed with 
flour, and stew them gently for about half an hour, 
then put them into scallop-shells or a dish, covered 
with crumbs of bread. Put them over a charcoal 
fire for a short time, and brown with a salamander. 



25L MUSHROOM POWDER (Eighteenth Century) 

Take about half a peck of large buttons or flaps, 
clean them (but you must not wash them), and set 
them one by one in an earthen dish or dripping 
pan. Let them stand in a slow oven to dry until 
they will beat to a powder, and when they are 
powdered, sift them through a sieve. Take half 
a quarter of an ounce of mace and a nutmeg, beat 
and grate them very flne, and mix them with your 
mushroom powder. Bottle it, and it will be fit for 
use. 



252. BAKED ONIONS (Surrey) 

Put four or five Spanish onions, with their skins 
on, in a saucepan of salted water ; let them boil 
quickly for one hour. Then take them out, dry 
them thoroughly, wrap each one separately in a 
piece of buttered paper (or a paper bag) and bake 
them in a moderate oven for two hours or longer. 
Remove the paper and serve the onions in their 
skins. 



108 VEGETABLES AND VEGETARIAN DISHES 

253. RISOTTO (Lancashire) 

A quarter of a pound of rice, a small onion, some 
stock, salt, pepper, butter, grated Parmesan cheese. 
Chop up the onion and fry it in butter. Put the 
rice in a saucepan with the stock and fried onion, 
and boil gently until the rice is tender and has 
absorbed all the stock. Stir in the cheese, salt, and 
pepper, and serve very hot. 

254. RISOTTO FOR TWO PERSONS (Hertfordshire) 

One onion, two ounces of rice, boiled in stock, 
two tomatoes put through a sieve, one ounce of 
grated cheese. Cut the onion in rings and fry in 
butter, till pale yellow. Strain all, and add the 
cheese just before serving. 

255. TO BOIL PARSNIPS (Eighteenth Century) 

Wash your parsnips well, boil them till they are 
soft, then take off the skin, beat them in a bowl with a 
a httle salt, put to them a httle cream and a lump 
of butter ; put them in a tossiag-pan, and let them 
boil till they are like a custard pudding ; put them on 
a plate, and serve them up. 

256. PARSNIPS FRIED TO LOOK LIKE TROUT 

(Yorkshire, 1769) 

Take a middling sort of parsnips, not over thick, 
and boil them as soft as you would do for eating ; 
peel, and cut them in two the long way. You must 
only fry the small ends, not the thick ones. Beat two 
or three eggs, put to them a tablespoonful of flour, 
dip in your parsnips, and fry them a hght brown in 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETARIAN DISHES 109 

butter. Have for your sauce a little vinegar and 
butter. 



257. JUGGED PEAS (Surrey) 

This is one of the best ways to cook peas, 
whether fresh, tinned, or bottled. Shell a pint 
of peas, put them into a clean two-pound pickle 
bottle or any jar with a closely-fitting top, adding 
a tablespoonful of butter, a teaspoonful of powdered 
sugar, a saltspoonful of salt, a dozen mint leaves, 
(and, at discretion, a very little black pepper). 
Cover the vessel tightly, and immerse it, to the 
extent of half its depth, in a pan of boihng water. 
Set the latter on the fire and boil briskly. Examine 
in half an hour : the peas, if very young, should be 
done by then ; if old, they will of course take longer. 

258. PEAS PUDDING (Ireland) 

Put a quart of dried peas rather loosely into a 
cloth, put them down in cold water slowly to boil 
till tender — good peas will take about two hours 
and a half. Rub through a sieve, adding an egg, 
an ounce of butter, some pepper and salt, and beat 
them well for about ten minutes. Flour the cloth, 
and tie the pudding tight as possible, and boil an 
hour longer. (Dried peas should always be soaked 
over-night for at least twelve hours.) 

259. PEAS PUDDING HOT (Ireland) 

This is an old recjpe for peas pudding, to accom- 
pany cold pork. Put a breakfastcupful of split peas 
in a cloth : tie loosely to allow for swelling, and 



110 VEGETABLES AND VEGETARIAN DISHES 

boil fast for three hours in salted water. Turn out 
and serve with melted butter. 

260. STEWED PEAS (Eighteenth Century) 
Take a quart of young peas, wash them, and put 
them into a stewpan, with a quarter of a pound of 
butter, three cabbage lettuces cut small, five or six 
young onions, with a little thyme, parsley, pepper, 
and salt, and let them stew all together for a quarter 
of an hour ; then put to them a pint of gravy, with 
two or three shoes of bacon or ham, and let them 
stew aU together tiU the peas are done enough ; then 
thicken them with a quarter of a pound of butter 
rolled in flour. 

261. BROWNED POTATOES WITH CHEESE 
(Surrey) 

Boil some potatoes in their " jackets," but do not 
let them fall to pieces. Remove peel, and pare 
them tiU all are the same size. Have a Uttle butter 
melted in a bowl, dip them in this, then roll them 
in grated cheese, seasoned with pepper and salt. 
Put them in a buttered tin in a good oven, and 
when the cheese has coloured, serve " hot and hot." 

262. CREAMED POTATOES (Kent) 

Take six large potatoes, one ounce of butter, 
a quarter of a pint of milk, the juice of half a lemon, 
pepper, and salt. Peel the potatoes and boil them 
for about five minutes, in order to make them a 
little tender, but not at all breakable. Cut them 
up into slices about a quarter of an inch thick. 
Melt the butter in a small saucepan, throw in the 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETARIAN DISHES HI 

potatoes and stir them till they are well buttered, 
but not brown. Add the milk, pepper, and salt. 
Let the whole simmer tiU the slices of potato grow 
tender, and the sauce in which they are simmering 
is a Uttle thickened. Then take the pan off the 
fire, add the lemon-juice, take out the slices of 
potato and range them on a dish. Boil up the 
sauce again with a pinch of flour to thicken it, pour 
it over the potato and serve at once. 

263. CURRIED POTATOES (Hertfordshire) 
Fry in dripping an onion, cut into thin slices. 
Cut up some boiled potatoes, and fry with the onion, 
dredge them with curry-powder, and add a little 
gravy, salt, and some lemon juice, if you have it. 
Allow this to stew for a quarter of an hour, and 
serve. 

264. SEETHED POTATOES (Kent, 1809) 
A number of small potatoes, or large potatoes 
cut in sUces, are put into a cast-iron pot without a 
lid, with a sprinkling of salt, to which is sometimes 
added a small piece of butter. The pot without a 
lid is hung upon the crane which is found in the 
chimney of every cottage in Scotland, so as to be 
considerably above the fire, and to heat very slowly. 
No person who has not eaten potatoes prepared in 
this manner can conceive how deUcious they are. 

265. POTATO SANDERS (Surrey) 
Mix with cold boiled potatoes, mashed up or 
passed through a sieve, enough flour to make a 
paste [i.e. nearly half their weight in flour). Dripping 



112 VEGETABLES AND VEGETARIAN DISHES 

rubbed in, — about four ounces to the pound — will 
greatly improve the paste : but will be debarred 
from the strict vegetarian. Roll out the paste about 
half an inch thick, and cut it in small squares. Soak 
some bread crumbs in a very little water, just enough 
to moisten them well : mix in with them some 
minced parsley, herbs, a little minced onion, salt 
(see " Vegetable Goose," No. 273). Put a little of 
this mixture into each square of paste, roU up, and 
bake as a sausage roll. 



266. STEWED POTATOES (Kent, 1809) 

Take a pipkin, having a lid made to fit close. Lay 
in it one or two or more rows of potatoes, with 
the skins scraped off, and cut into slices. Sprinlde 
a little pepper and salt over them. Then lay a 
row of onions, then, i£ it can be afforded, a mutton 
chop. Then let there be layers of potatoes, onions, 
with pepper and salt and mutton, until the pipkin 
is filled. If mutton cannot be afforded, use a very 
small portion of dripping or mutton suet ; add a 
teacupful of water. Put the pipkin, with the lid 
on, covered with a piece of linen cloth, into a pan 
of water, without a lid. Let the water boU very 
slowly, or rather simmer, for five or six hours. 
Potatoes, when thus prepared, afford a most savoury 
and nourishing meal. 

267. POTATOES WITH WHITE SAUCE (Middlesex) 

Put into a saucepan a small slice of butter, with 

a little flour, diluted with a little stock : to which 

add some salt and pepper, and thicken it over the 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETARIAN DISHES 113 

fire ; having boiled the potatoes, peeled them, and 
cut them into shoes, pour this sauce over them, 
and serve hot. To vary the flavour, some minced 
capers or a little chopped parsley may be added to 
the sauce. 



268. TO STEW SPINACH (Eighteenth Century) 

Wash your spinach well in several waters, put it 
in a colander, have ready a large pan of boiling 
water, with a handful of salt, put it in, let it boil two 
minutes, it wiU take off the strong earthy taste ; 
then put it into a sieve, squeeze it well. Put a quarter 
of a pound of butter in a tossing-pan, put in your 
spinach, keep turning and chopping it with a knife 
until it is quite dry and green ; lay it upon a plate, 
press it with another, cut it in the shape of sippets 
or diamonds, pour round it very rich melted butter. 
It will eat exceedingly mild, and with quite a 
different taste from the common way. 



269. SPINACH WITH POACHED EGGS 
(Yorkshire, 1769) 

Take two or three handfuls of young spinach, 
pick it from the stalks, wash and drain it very 
clean, put it into a pan with a lump of butter and a 
little salt, and keep stirring it aU the time till it be 
done enough, then take it out and squeeze out the 
water. Chop it and add a little more butter, lay it 
in your dish in quarters, and betwixt every quarter 
(sic) a poached egg, and one in the middle. Fry 
some sippets of white bread and put them into your 
spinach, so serve it up.

270. SUCCOTASH (American) 

Have green maize freshly cut, and take the cobs 
cleanly out of the outer leaves, etc. Add an equal 
quantity of soaked butter beans or haricot beans. 
Put them into a saucepan with only just enough 
water to cover them ; let them simmer tOl perfectly 
tender, then pour off the water and pour in the same 
amount of milk. Let the vegetables stew a little 
more, then add pepper and salt and a teaspoonful 
of cornflour mixed smooth in a little cold milk, and 
a lump of butter about as big as a large walnut. 
Mix well, let all boU up once, and serve very hot. 

271. SCALLOPED TOMATOES (Sussex) 

Put alternate layers of tomatoes and bread crumb 
in a pie-dish. Let the top layer be of tomato. 
Sprinkle bits of butter over. Season well and baie. 

272. VEGETABLE CURRY (Kent) 

Cut onions into thin slices, and fry a good brown 
in butter ; add a breakfast cup of milk in which a 
teaspoonful of curry has been mixed. Let all boil 
together for twenty minutes, stirring the whole 
time. Then add the vegetables, — previously par- 
boiled — and let all simmer for an hour. Potatoes, 
peas, beans, carrots, and turnips may be used. 
Broad beans alone make a delicious curry. 

273. VEGETABLE GOOSE (Surrey) 

Soak half a pound of bread crumbs in cold water, 
squeeze them nearly dry and mash them. Mix in 
one onion chopped small, one teaspoonful chopped 



VEGETABLES AND VEGETARIAN DISHES 115 

parsley and herbs, one ounce of butter, pepper and 
salt to taste. Put in a buttered dish and bake in 
good oven for about one hour. 



274. VEGETABLE HOT POT (Kent) 

Take two large potatoes, one stick of celery, one 
large carrot, one large onion, butter, pepper, and 
salt. Slice the vegetables, put them in layers in 
a pie-dish, with a layer of potatoes at the top. Pour 
in sufficient boiling water to cover them. Set the 
dish in a cool oven and let it simmer for one and a 
half hours. Lay little pieces of butter on the top, 
and serve very hot. This method of cooking the 
vegetables preserves the flavour far better than 
boiling would do. 

275. VEGETABLE PIE (Surrey 

Required, one onion, one carrot, one turnip, one 
stick of celery, one handful of green peas (if in 
season), half an ounce of sago, one ounce of butter, 
pepper and salt, pie-crust. Gut all the vegetables 
small, and stew them with the sago and butter in a 
very little water until nearly cooked. Then put 
them in a pie-dish, cover with crust, and bake about 
half an hour. Any other vegetables may be used 
at pleasure. Mushrooms are always an improve- 
ment. 

276. VEGETABLE-MARROW AU GRATIN (Sussex) 

Take some very small marrows, slice them in 
rounds about half an inch thick, and lay them in a 



116 VEGETABLES AND VEGETARIAN DISHES 

pie-dish. Pour tomato sauce over tUl they are 
hidden, then cover with bread crumbs and grated 
cheese, and sprinkle httle bits of butter over. Bake 
in a good oven until you find the marrow tender on 
trying it with a fork. 



CHAPTER Vn 
SALADS 

Note. — Although our ancestors were exceedingly 
fond of salads, and mcluded much more under 
this head than we ever dream of using — they 
rarely troubled to write down any formal recipe. 
Their gardens were full of " salletings," — not only 
lettuce, cucumber, radish, mustard, cress, water- 
cress, beet, celery, onions, and " love-apples " 
(tomatoes) — but a great many salad-plants of which 
we in England now hardly know the names. A 
sorrel-bed was a common thing — for sorrel, as 
Evelyn observed, " imparts so grateful a quickness 
to the salad that it should never be left out." 
Chervil, purslane, bumet, lambs' lettuce, " small- 
mustard," tarragon, dandelion, and various other 
plants, were welcome ingredients in the salad-bowl. 
And I conjecture that these wise folk also included 
cold cooked potatoes, old or new, cold cooked 
onions, and any such left-over vegetable odds and 
ends. Their salad dressings would seem to have 
been quite simple — oil, pepper, and vinegar, salt 
and mustard, plus an occasional hard-boiled yolk 
and a spoonful of cream. For the most part, I 
imagine, they did not bother about dressings at all. 
They preferred uncooked to cooked vegetables, as 
has already been said, and the mere plain green 

117 



118 SALADS 

foodstuffs sufficed them. The Mayonnaise Sauce 
recipe given on page 120 will be found particularly 
good. 

277. APPLE SALAD (Sussex) 

Two cupfuls of sour apple, half a cupful of celery, 
half a cupful of English walnuts, two tablespoonfuls 
of salad dressing, one cupful of whipped cream, one 
teaspoonful of sugar. Salt and pepper. 

278. CHEESE SALAD (Sussex) 

Rub the yolk of a hard-boiled egg with a dessert- 
spoonful of butter, add salt, sugar, pepper, mustard, 
about half a pound of grated cheese, and a dessert- 
spoonful of vinegar. 

279. ENDIVE SALAD (Middlesex) 

Take some fine white endives, carefully wash and 
drain them, and lay them in a salad-bowl. Chop 
some shalots, wash them in several waters, and 
squeeze out the water in a cloth. Add them to the 
endive, together with some chopped tarragon, 
chervil, and burnet. Season with thin mayonnaise 
sauce, and add two finely chopped Chili capsicums. 

280. GERMAN SALAD (Hertfordshire) 

One tablespoonful of salad oil, one and a half 
tablespoonfuls light claret, one ounce chopped 
onion, one teaspoonful French mustard, one table- 
spoonful of white wine, the yolk of one boiled egg, 
passed through sieve. Take boiled potatoes, sliced 
beetroot in dice, sliced cucumber ; mix all together. 



SALADS 119 

281. HARICOT SALAD (Kent) 

One pint of white haricots, well boiled. Sprinkle 
over them one teaspoonful of salt, and half a tea- 
spoonful of pepper ; add a very finely-chopped onion, 
or a few drops of shalot vinegar, one tablespooniul 
of vinegar, two of oil, and sprinkling of very finely 
chopped parsley. 

282. WINTER SALAD (Surrey) 

Take some white haricot beans, French beans, 
potatoes, beetroot, and onions. Blanch all the 
vegetables separately, cool, and drain them. Chop 
the onions, and put them in the corner of a cloth ; 
dip this in cold water, and press the water out of 
the onion. Do this two or three times, which will 
render the onion more digestible. Cut the potatoes 
and beetroots in half -inch discs. Put all into a 
salad-bowl, adding some chopped chervil ; season 
with salt, pepper, oil, and vinegar, and mix the 
whole well. 

283. WINTER SALAD (Middlesex) 

Cut up small some endive and celery, add two 
tablespoonfuls of russet apples cut into dice. Stir 
well and cover these with half a pound of grated 
nuts, and mix mayonnaise sauce with the whole. 

284. SALAD DRESSING (Kent) 
Take the yolks of two hard-boiled eggs ; bruise 
them very carefully until they are in a fine powder, 
entirely free from lumps. Then add gradually a 
tablespooniul (or a little more, according to taste) 
of the best salad oil, and stir it well until it is the 



120 SALADS 

consistence of a smooth paste ; then add a table- 
spoonful of freshly mixed mustard. After this is 
well mixed, stir in very gradually two tablespoonfuls 
of white vinegar and a teaspoonful of Chili vinegar ; 
then add a little salt, a few grains of cayenne pepper 
and a few drops of anchovy sauce. When these 
are all weU mixed, stir in gradually a large tea- 
cupful or more of good sweet cream. Add a small 
lump of sugar. This mixture wiU keep a week if 
well corked. It is thicker and better if used the 
day after it is made. 

285. CHEAP SALAD DRESSING (Ireland) 

Take one hard-boiled egg, one tablespoonful of 
flour, the same of vinegar (or more ad lib), one 
breakfastcupful of milk, one dessertspoonful of 
butter, one teaspoonful of mustard, a pinch of salt, 
a little sugar. Blend the flour and milk. Blend 
to a paste, in separate bowl, a hot yolk of egg, 
with butter, mustard, and salt. Then add blended 
milk and flour. Boil the mixture, keeping it stirred 
until it thickens. When cold, add vinegar to it : 
and if still too thick, put a little cold milk. The 
white of an egg can be chopped up and added, or 
used for decoration. 

286. MAYONNAISE SAUCE (Isle of Wight) 

Whisk the yolks of six eggs, add to them one 
dessertspoonful of made mustard, one saltspoonful 
of salt, and a pinch of cayenne, stirring all the time. 
Put them into an enamelled saucepan, then add a 
quarter of a pint of salad oil, whisking all the time ; 
next, a quarter of a pint of milk or cream, one table- 



SALADS 121 

spoonful of vinegar, and the same of Worcester 
sauce. Last, add a quarter of a pint of vinegar. Con- 
tinue to stir gently all the time you are mixing, or 
the sauce will curdle. Now put the saucepan over 
a slow fire and whisk until it becomes thick. It 
must not boil. Take it off the fire, continue stirring 
gently till it cools. Then put it into wide-mouthed 
bottles, cork closely, and it will keep two or three 
months. (This is a yacht steward's recipe, and 
most excellent.) 



CHAPTER VIII 
CHEESE DISHES 

Note. — The vast majority of cheese-made dishes 
are quite modern. Either cheese, in former days, 
was eaten to the very rind, careless of its hard- 
ness, staleness, or " blue-vinny " appearance : or 
it was little esteemed as a combined flavouring and 
nutriment when used in small quantities along with 
vegetables, eggs, etc. Nowadays it is not only, in 
grated form, a chief ingredient of many vegetarian 
dishes, but a most valuable adjunct to all sorts of 
home-made savouries. And as these recipes afford 
the means of utihsing odd bits of hard, dry cheese, 
the careful cook will gladly avail herself of them. 
I have included one form of serving cheese, which 
will be found exceedingly palatable, simple, and 
digestible : the " Creamed Cheese," No. 288. No one 
who has ever tried this is likely to revert to the 
toasted cheeses and " Welsh Rabbits " which he 
(or she) has so frequently relished — and regretted. 

287. CHEESE BISCUITS (Sussex) 

Take nine ounces of flour, six ounces of grated 
cheese, three ounces of butter, one or two table- 
spoonfuls of milk, two eggs, pepper, and salt. Roll 
out very thin and bake fifteen or twenty minutes. 

122 



CHEESE DISHES 123 

288. CREAMED CHEESE (Cheshire) 

This is the simplest, easiest, most digestible, 
and economical, way of serving " Welsh Rabbit," 
and one very little known at all. Scrape or thinly 
flake some cheese iato a breakfa/St-cup or small 
bowl, until it is three-parts full. FiU it up with 
boiling water, cover it with a saucer, stand it on a 
hob, or stove, or in the fender before an open fire, 
for about ten minutes. At the end of that time, 
pour off the water (with which will go all the oily 
matter of the cheese) and you will find the cheese 
like a thick cream at the bottom. Pour this upon 
a piece of hot toast upon a hot plate, pepper and 
salt it to taste, and serve. The above quantity is 
enough for one person. Canadian Cheddar will 
serve, though English Cheddar is better. As a 
lunch or supper dish it is most excellent. 

289. COTTAGE CREAM CHEESE (Rutlandshire) 

Take some milk which has gone sour suddenly, 
and reduce it to curds and whey by boiling. Place 
the curd on a cloth to drain thoroughly, and when 
it is dry as you can get it, press it down tightly in 
a wooden box, with clean fresh hazel leaves laid 
here and there in layers. Keep a good weight upon 
the top of the curd, and turn it when thoroughly 
dry. It will be fit to eat in a couple of days. 

290. CHEESE FRITTERS (Stissex) 

Take two tablespoonfuls of flour, a little made 
mustard, cayenne pepper, salt, one egg, and one 
ounce of Parmesan cheese. Add as much milk as 
will make it into a stifE batter. Heat some lard 



124 CHEESE DISHES 

very hot, and drop the batter into it a spoonful 
at a time. The fritters should be a golden brown 
when done. 

291. MACARONI CHEESE (Boiled) (Isle of Wight) 
Half a pound of tomatoes, one tablespoonful curry 
powder, a quarter of a pound of macaroni, two ounces 
butter, salt and pepper, two ounces grated cheese. 
Put the macaroni into salted boiling water, boil it 
thirty minutes, and drain it. Scald the tomatoes, 
peel and slice them. Put the butter in a saucepan 
to melt, add sliced tomatoes, and macaroni, stir 
well together, add pinch of salt and curry powder. 
Lastly, with two forks, stir in the grated cheese for 
five minutes, then serve. 

292. MACARONI CHEESE AND TOMATOES 
(Devonshire) 

Half a pound of macaroni, one pound of tomatoes, 
two ounces cheese (Parmesan), two ounces Gruyere, 
half an ounce of butter, one shalot, pepper, salt, 
browned bread crumbs. Wash the macaroni, cut it 
up into small pieces and boil it in salted water tiU 
tender. Scald the tomatoes, and then they will 
easily peel ; slice them, chop the shalot finely, 
place the various ingredients respectively in layers 
in a greased pie-dish. The last layer must be the 
macaroni. Then on the top put a little grated 
cheese, the brown bread crumbs, and the butter. 
Bake half an hour in a brisk oven. 

293. CHEESE PUDDING (Isle of Wight) 
Two ounces of grated cheese, two ounces of bread- 
crumbs, one ounce of butter, one teaspoonful made 



CHEESE DISHES 125 

mustard, half a gill of milk, one egg, cayenne pepper, 
salt. Put butter and milk into saucepan, make 
quite hot, pour over crumbs and cheese, then add 
yolk of egg and mustard mixed. Whip white of egg 
and add lastly, or it may be pUed on the top (when 
pudding is cooked) with a little grated cheese, and 
just set. Bake pudding twenty minutes. 



294. CHEESE PUDDING (Kent) 

Two eggs, half a teacupful of cream or good milk, 
and a Uttle salt and pepper. Two large tablespoon- 
fuls of grated cheese. Mix all together, and bake 
for twenty minutes in quick oven. 

295. CHEESE PUDDINGS (Surrey) 

(1) Grate three ounces of cheese, mix with two 
ounces of bread crumbs, two weU-beaten eggs, one 
and a half pints of milk, pepper and salt to taste, 
and a squeeze of lemon juice. Bake in a well- 
buttered dish from a half to three-quarters of 
an hour. 

(2) Three ounces of grated cheese, three ounces 
of bread crumbs, a Mttle made mustard, salt to taste. 
Pour over as much boiling milk as it will absorb, 
and two well-beaten eggs. Bake in a buttered pie- 
dish about twenty minutes, and serve immediately 
and very hot. 

(3) One teacupful of milk, one teaspoonful of 
flour, one well-beaten egg, one ounce creamed 
butter, four ounces of grated cheese. Mix well, and 
bake ten to fifteen minutes. To be served and eaten 
at once. 



126 CHEESE DISHES 

296. GLOUCESTER RABBIT 

Make some buttered toast, cut it into rounds or 
squares, put it to keep hot in the oven. Put half 
an ounce of butter in a small saucepan to melt, stir 
in two tablespoonfuls of grated cheese, half a small 
teacupful of milk and two tablespoonfuls of fresh 
bread crumbs — enough to make it as thick as 
cream. Add salt and pepper, pour the mixture on 
to the toast, and serve it immediately. 

297. RAMAKINS (Surrey) 

Beat up two eggs thoroughly, add in two ounces 
of grated cheese, two tablespoonfuls of cream or 
mUk, one teaspoonful of flour (mixed smooth first iu 
a drop of milk). Pepper and salt to taste. While 
you are doing this, cream two ounces of butter in 
a cup, on the stove or in the oven, and add that 
last : mix all well together, pour into buttered 
patty-pans, and bake a quarter of an hour or twenty 
minutes in a good hot oven. The ramakins should 
be a golden brown. These never faU to please. 

298. CHEESE STRAWS (Essex) 

Rub one and a half ounces of butter into three 
ounces of flour, with the finger-tips. Add one and 
a half ounces of American Cheddar, grated, quarter 
of a teaspoonful of baking powder, a little cayenne, 
a small pinch of salt, and a little water, enough to 
mix it into a very dry dough. Roll it out an eighth 
of an inch thick, and cut it into sticks two and a 
half inches long. Bake it like pastry, but don't 
let it colour. 



CHEESE DISHES 127 

299. CHEESE STRAWS (Isle of Wight) 

Two ounces of butter, two ounces of flour, one 
yolk of egg, three ounces of cheese (two ounces of 
Parmesan and one ounce of Cheddar), one table- 
spoonful of cold water, cayenne pepper, salt. Rub 
the butter into the flour, add the grated cheese, 
pepper, and salt, mix to the consistency of pastry 
with the yolk and water ; roll out, and cut into rings 
and straws, allowing six straws to one ring. When 
served, the straws are placed through the rings. 
Bake a short while in a quick oven. 



300. CHEESE STRAWS (Kent) 

Two ounces of butter, two ounces of flour, two 
ounces of breadcrumbs, two ounces of grated cheese, 
half small saltspoonful of mixed salt and cayenne ; 
mix all to a paste, roll it out quarter of an inch ia 
thickness ; cut it into narrow strips, lay them on 
a sheet of paper, and bake for a few minutes. Ar- 
range the straws on a napkin and serve hot. 

301. CHEESE STRAWS (Staffordshire) 

Half pound of dried flour, quarter poiind of butter, 
quarter pound of grated cheese, teaspoonful mus- 
tard, cayenne, saltspoonful of salt. Rub butter 
into the flour, and then mix the whole well to- 
gether. Beat the whites of two eggs with half a pint 
of cold water, and stir in enough to form a firm paste. 
Knead it well. Roll it out the eighth of an inch 
thick, and cut it into straw-like strips, about five 
inches long. Bake in a quick oven a pale brown 



128 CHEESE DISHES 

colour — about five minutes. Pile them on a dish 
prettily, and serve hot or cold. Must be kept in 
a dry place. 

302. CHEESE STRAWS (Siirrey) 

Three ounces of flour, two ounces of butter, the 
yolk of one egg, three ounces of grated cheese, 
cayenne, and salt. Rub the butter into the flour, 
add the cheese and seasoning. Mix iato a stiff 
paste with the yolk of egg. Roll out and cut into 
narrow strips about two inches long. Bake a pale 
fawn colour on a greased tin or baking sheet. To 
be served hot. 

303. CHEESE STRAWS (Yorkshire) 

Grate two ounces of Parmesan cheese into a 
bowl. Mix with it a pinch of salt, a little cayeime, 
and two ounces of flour, and rub in two ounces of 
butter. Make the ingredients into a stiff paste 
with the yolk of one egg, cut them about five 
inches long, and bake them. When they are a pale 
brown colour they are done. They will take about 
ten minutes. 

304. CROUSTADES (Yorkshire) 

Make a good paste, roll it out very thin, line small 
patty pans or moulds with it. Grate two ounces 
Parmesan cheese into a basin, and mix with it 
one ounce warmed (but not oiled) butter, the yolks 
of two eggs and white of one, a saltspoonful of salt, 
and a pinch of cayenne. If the eggs are small, 
three yolks will be required instead of two. Put a 
small spoonful of the mixture into the pans, and 



CHEESE DISHES 129 

bake in a moderate oven. When they are set and 
the pastry is lightly coloured, they are done enough. 

305. STEWED CHEESE (Surrey) 

Take four ounces of grated cheese, two ounces of 
butter, one tablespoonful of cream ; stir them to- 
gether in a saucepan until nearly boihng. Add the 
beaten-up yolk of an egg, stir well, and pour the 
mixture upon a very hot dish. Serve with dry hot 
toast. 



CHAPTER IX 
EGG DISHES 

Note. — Countless as are the various methods 
of serving eggs, there yet seems room for more. 
As is pointed out in the Cakes section, our 
grandmothers used eggs v/ith what we should con- 
sider reckless extravagance, merely as ingredients 
in made dishes. They do not appear to have 
considered eggs seriously as articles of food. How- 
ever, a few interesting egg-disKes are here set forth, 
which will help towards the (always too mono- 
tonous) breakfast and luncheon table, or towards 
the enlargement of the vegetarian menu. 

Eggs have been divided by a humorist into seven 
classes : viz. 

New-laid Eggs. 
Breakfast Eggs. 
Fresh Eggs. 
Cooking Eggs. 
Shop Eggs. 
Election Eggs. 
Eggs. 

And nowadays, when the origin of those harmless 
necessary edibles is so frequently " wrop in mystery," 
it behoves one to be exceedingly careful. You 
should break all eggs, of whose antecedents you 

130 



EGG DISHES 131 

are not absolutely certain, one by one into separate 
cups, lest a single tainted specimen should ruin all. 
And it is usually cheaper, in the long run, to procure 
the best eggs only ; for those coming under the 
category of cooking eggs are hardly ever to be 
depended on. We are not of the same mind as 
those Tartar tribes who bury their eggs in the earth 
till they shall be " high " enough to suit the tribal 
tastes ; and even the notorious " curate's egg," 
which was " good in parts," displeases our fastidious 
fancy. It is therefore advisable to lay in a stock 
of eggs when they are cheap and plentiful, and to 
preserve them against the dear days, first testing 
each by any of the different recognized methods. 



306. BAKED EGGS (Kent) 

Beat up four eggs well. To each egg allow two 
tablespoonfuls of new milk and half a teaspoonful 
of fine-chopped parsley ; season with pepper and 
salt to taste. Melt some butter (or dripping) in an 
enamelled pie-dish ; pour in mixture, and bake 
quickly in a quick oven. 



307. BIRDS' NESTS (Essex) 

Boil four eggs eleven minutes, let them get quite 
cold, then shell the eggs and coat them over with 
egg, and roll in sausage meat. Drop them in a pan 
with plenty of lard, and brown them well. Lift 
them up and drain them, nut them in halves, and 
serve on buttered toast. These are very nice eaten 
cold, served up on a dish with watercress. 



132 EGG DISHES 

308. CHEESED EGGS (Surrey) 

Boil six eggs hard, and when they are cold, remove 
the shells. Gut them in slices, arrange these in 
layers in a well-buttered baking-dish, with pepper 
and salt. Dust grated cheese over each layer, and 
moisten with white sauce. On the top, put a layer 
of cheese, and over that a little (melted) butter. 
(Sliced tomatoes may at pleasure be included in this 
dish.) Bake until lightly coloured. 

309. CURRIED EGGS (Essex) 

Four hard-boiled eggs, one sour apple, one large 
onion, one ounce of butter, one ounce of flour, one 
dessertspoonful of curry powder, one tablespoonful 
of cream, one small teaspoonful of salt, half a pint 
of milk, or milk and water, quarter of a pound of 
Patna rice. Boil the eggs for ten minutes, shell 
and lay them in cold water, to keep white. Peel 
and chop finely the apple and onion, fry them in the 
butter for five minutes, using a saucepan ; stir in 
curry powder, then the flour and salt ; lastly, the 
milk, and simmer gently for a quarter of an hour. 
Add the cream and the eggs, which should be cut 
in quarters. When quite hot, serve in a border of 
boiled rice. 

310. CURRIED EGGS (Yorkshire) 

Slice finely a couple of onions, and fry them a 
delicate brown in two ounces of butter ; rub to- 
gether till smooth, two ounces of curry powder, 
two spoonfuls of good vinegar, and a teaspoonful 
of castor sugar. Stir into it, over the fire, about 



EGG DISHES 133 

a breakfastcupful of good stock, and bring it to the 
boil. When nicely blended, break into it five 
or six eggs, and let them cook gently in this about 
one or two minutes. Serve at once, with curried 
rice. 

311. EGGS A LA DUCHESSE (Kent) 
BoU several new-laid eggs for ten minutes ; take 
off the shells, and cut them in half (long-ways) ; 
take out the yolks ; have ready some bread crumbs 
soaked in milk, and mix (together with the yolks) 
a little pepper, salt, and a little lemon peel and 
parsley chopped fine. Put a layer of this mixture 
at the bottom of a pie-dish ; then fiU the whites 
with the force-meat, and build them up in a pyramid 
with some pieces of butter put on them and a few 
bread crumbs, and then let them be in the oven to 
get brown — not long enough for the white of egg 
to get hard. 

312. A PRETTY DISH OF EGGS (Yorkshire) 
Break some eggs into a small pie-dish without 
injuring the yolks, drop lightly some warm butter 
on them, and strew bread crumbs lightly over them ; 
put into the oven till the whites of the eggs are set, 
and serve with a wreath of parsley. Of course, you 
can put any quantity of eggs, but I should say about 
one ounce of bread crumbs to four eggs. 

313. BROWN FRICASSEE OF EGGS (Yorkshire, 1769) 

Take eight or ten eggs, according to the bigness 

you design your dish : boil them hard. Put them 

in a stewpan of cold water, take off the shell ; then 



134 EGG DISHES 

fry them in butter till they be of a deep brown. 
Have a little brown gravy and a lump of butter, 
thicken it up with flour. Lay two or three eggs in 
the middle of the dish, then cut the others in two, 
and set them with the small ends upward round the 
dish. Fry some sippets and lay round them. 
Garnish with crisp parsley. 

314. WHITE FRICASSEE OF EGGS (Yorkshire, 1769) 

Take ten or twelve eggs, boil them hard and peel 
them, put them in a stewpan with a little white 
gravy. Take the yolks of two or three eggs, beat 
them very well, and put to them two or three table- 
spoonfuls of cream, a tablespoonful of white wine, 
a little lemon juice, shred parsley, and salt to taste. 
Shake all together over the stove tUl it be as thick 
as cream, but don't let it boU. Lay some of the 
eggs whole in the dish, lay the rest round, cut in 
halves and quarters ; but you must not cut them 
till you lay them in the dish. Garnish with sippets. 

315. OMELETTE (Kent) 

The yolks and whites of six eggs (these will 
suffice for three or four persons), well beaten for 
at least three minutes with three tablespoonfuls 
of mUk, some chopped parsley and onion, half a 
teaspoonful of salt, a little pepper. When this is 
ready, put a piece of butter as large as a walnut 
into the frying-pan over a brisk fire, and when the 
butter is hot, throw in the mixture of eggs, stirring 
it, or rather, putting it together with a spoon or 
ladle, to give it the shape, which can be finished 
doing when it is thrown ofi the frying-pan on the 



EGG DISHES 135 

dish, for it must not be kept more than two 
minutes on the fire. 



316. OMELETTES (Surrey) 

To prepare a plain omelette, see that the frying- 
pan is thoroughly clean. Place ia it about one 
ounce of butter. Break three eggs separately to 
see that they are fresh, beat them up with a little 
chopped parsley, and a piach of pepper and salt. 
The eggs should not be beaten too much, or the 
white of them separates, and you produce a watery 
mixture which destroys the flavour and appearance 
of the omelette. When the butter is melted, pour 
the mixture into the frying-pan, and stir it till it 
begins to set or thicken. Shake the pan occasion- 
ally, and fold over the omelette neatly in an oval 
shape. When it is of a golden colour, turn it 
quickly into a hot dish. To be able to prepare a 
plain omelette is to be able to prepare any kind. 
If you require a cheese omelette, introduce into the 
mixture about a dessertspoonful of grated cheese, 
with a little pepper and salt, and sometimes a few 
grains of cayenne. In a sweet omelette, no pepper 
and salt, but a httle grated sugar, and just before 
the omelette is folded in the pan, distribute evenly 
over it a little jam. If a bacon omelette, a few pieces 
of previously cooked bacon cut into small dice, and 
so on. In preparing an omelette, remember five 
things : a clean pan ; mixture not to be too much 
beaten ; omelette must not be too large (three eggs 
are better than six) ; it should not be too much 
cooked; it must be eaten immediately, or it be- 
comes tough and flabby. 



136 EGG DISHES 

317. PALESTINE EGGS (Surrey) 

Trim and boil twelve good-sized Jerusalem arti- 
chokes, and set them to cool. Boil six eggs hard and 
let them get cold (they can be plunged into a bowl 
of cold water), then cut them up. Slice the arti- 
chokes, lay them in a buttered baking-dish ; strew 
the chopped eggs over them ; next, put a layer of 
shced tomatoes ; last, a layer of grated cheese. 
Bake until lightly coloured, and serve very hot. 

318. SCALLOPED EGGS (Devonshire) 

Four new-laid eggs, half a teaspoonful made 
mustard, four tablespoonfuls white crumbs, half an 
ounce of butter, four tablespoonfuls chopped 
cooked ham, bacon, game, or chicken, two table- 
spoonfuls hot milk or stock ; salt and pepper. Mix 
crumbs, ham, and seasoning ; put half aside. Mix 
the other half with mustard, a little oiled butter, 
and enough milk to form a stiff paste. Butter 
four saucers or scaHop-sheUs, spread them thickly 
with the above paste, leaving a hoUow for the raw 
egg. Shake over each egg some of the dry mixture 
laid aside. Put a few pieces of butter here and 
there. Bake untU set ; about ten minutes. 

319. SCOTCH EGGS (Middlesex) 

Boil them hard, and when the sheU has been re- 
moved, cover them thickly with a forcemeat made 
as follows : — Take some veal or calves' kidney, with 
a slice of ham, a bit of butter, shalot, cayenne, and 
a green onion, all finely minced together, and mixed 
to a proper consistency with the yolks of eggs ; 



EGG DISHES 137 

dredge them with flour, and fry in boiling lard, or 
beef dripping : serve up with a rich gravy. 

320. SCOTCH EGGS (Scotland) 

Take as many eggs as required, allowing a half 
egg for each person and boil until hard. Then put 
into cold water and take off the shells when quite 
cold. Cover each egg with sausage meat, or well- 
seasoned rissole mixture, being careful to cover 
the egg completely, keeping them an oval shape. 
Flatten them at both ends, dip each into beaten 
egg, then into bread crumbs. Do this twice, so as 
to have a firm cover. Fry in boiling fat until brown. 
Cut them open with a sharp knife, and serve on a 
dish with good thick gravy. 

321. SCRAMBLED EGGS (Cheshire) 

Beat up four eggs, add salt and pepper, put them 
into a stewpan with two ounces of butter, keep 
stirring constantly with a wooden spoon tiU the eggs 
are nearly set ; then (1) serve as they are on a very 
hot dish, or (2) add two tablespoonfuls of tomato 
sauce, and stir for two minutes off the fire. 

322. EGGS STEWED IN GRAVY (Yorkshire, 1769) 

Pour a little gravy into a little pewter (or earthen- 
ware) dish, and set it on a stove. When it is hot, 
break in as many eggs as will cover the dish bottom, 
keep pouring the gravy over them with a spoon till 
they are white at the top. When they are set 
enough, strew over them a little salt : fry some 
square sippets of bread m. butter, arrange the eggs 
on them, and serve up. 



138 EGG DISHES 

323. EGG AND TOMATO MOULD (Yorkshire) 

One pound of tomatoes, four eggs, half a tea- 
cupful thin cream or milk, one clove garlic or onion. 
Scald and peel the tomatoes, cut into small pieces, 
simmer with the butter and seasoning. Remove 
the garlic as soon as it has flavoured the tomato. 
Mash the tomato as it cooks, with a wooden spoon. 
Let it boil ten minutes, then add the cream or milk, 
and four hard-boiled eggs (chopped), thicken the 
whole with a cornflour liaison. Pour into a wetted 
mould to stiffen. When cold, turn out and garnish 
with parsley and rubbed egg yolk. 

324. EGGS AND TOMATO SAUCE (Yorkshire) 

Place one pound of stewed and pulped tomatoes 
and a slice of onion into a stewpan, with two ounces 
of butter rubbed into one teaspoonful of flour ; add 
pepper and salt, and a little water if necessary. 
Stir well. Poach as many eggs as are required, 
and lay them on hot buttered toast. Pour the tomato 
sauce round, and scatter chopped parsley over the 
eggs to serve. 

325. EGGS IN THE TURKISH WAY (Surrey) 

Put an onion cut into slices, with some fine herbs 
and butter, into a saucepan, adding a little flour, 
salt, and pepper : when these have been on the fire 
a few minutes, add a glass of white French wine 
and the whites of a dozen hard-boiled eggs cut into 
slices : when these ingredients are well united, add the 
yolks, which had been previously set aside, and serve 
up very hot. 



CHAPTER X 
SAVOURIES 

Note. — Under this heading I include several pleas- 
ing little recipes which were received too late for 
insertion under other groupings : they are genuine 
country concoctions, and will be found to afford a 
light variety to the usual staple articles of diet. 
Although they have about them a somewhat more 
modem feeling than the majority of recipes in this 
book, I have the donors' words for it that these 
savouries have long been used with much success. 
In any case, they carry their own commendation 
to the " knowledgeable " cook. 

326. ANCHOVY CREAMS (Hertfordshire) 
Take a quarter of a pint of cream ; put into it a 
little anchovy sauce, enough to give it a delicate 
pink colour and flavour ; whip stiffly, and place on 
croutes of fried bread. 

327. ANCHOVY FILLETS AND GREEN BUTTER

Take half a pound of grated Cheddar cheese, 
half a pound of bread crumbs, one pint of milk, one

off superfiuous water. Beat the egg, add to the 
bread parsley or any other flavouring. Have ready 
boiling fat in frying pan. Drop the mixture in by 
tablespoonfuls, turn when sufficiently set, so as to 
brown both sides — or it may be made in one large 
fritter, filling the bottom of the pan. Any sort of 
meat or fish may be used. The above is enough for 
two persons. 

333. HADDOCK SOUFFLE (Hertfordshire) 

Boil a dried haddock, remove all skin and bones, 
pound it with a lump of butter, and a dash of cayenne 
pepper ; pass it through a sieve, mix it with three 
yolks of eggs, then add their whites whisked to a very 
stiff froth ; half fill some little cases with the mixture, 
and bake at once. (Filleted dried haddock may 
be treated as above.) 

334 KEBOBS (Hertfordshire) 

Cut a few pieces the size of an egg from a leg or 
loin of mutton ; chop a small onion, with seasoning to 



142 SAVOURIES 

taste, and lay this on the meat before rolling it up ; 
leave it covered for an hour, and then thread the 
pieces on a skewer, leaving a little space between ; 
grill or broil slowly, turning often, and as soon as it 
begins to brown, baste it with a little tomato juice 
diluted with mutton stock. 



335. ONION AND KIDNEY SAVOURY (Isle of Wight) 

Take a Spanish onion, cut out the centre, and 
insert a kidney which has been carefully washed

frequently with cooking butter ; serve with thick 
brown gravy. 

336. POTTED LIVER (Hampshire)

Boil some potatoes dry and floury ; mash them 
smoothly, make into a paste with an egg, adding a 
little salt and pepper. Roll out, and cut into 
rounds about five inches across, prepare a stuffing 
thus. Carefully chop or mince some boiled liver, 
add a few breadcrumbs, season with a little chopped 
onion and powdered sage, lay a little mixture on 
each round, fold over and wet the edges of one half 
to make it adhere to the other ; brush over with 
milk and bake in a quick oven.

338. DRESSED OYSTERS (Kent) 

Mix in a sherry glass one eggspoonful of tomato 
ketchup and an equal amount of lemon juice. Add 
one teaspoonful of French vinegar, a little pepper

the juice from their shells. Serve at once in sherry 
glasses. 

339. FINE PATTIES (Eighteenth Century) 

Slice either cold turkey, lamb, or chicken, with 
an equal quantity of the fat of lamb, or of loin of 
veal, or the inside fat of a sirloin of beef; add a 
little parsley, thyme, and shredded lemon peel, put it 
all in a marble mortar, and pound it very fine, 
season it with white pepper and salt ; then make a 
fine puff paste, roll it out in thin square sheets, put 
the forcemeat in the middle, cover it over, and close 
it evenly all round. Just before the patties go into 
the oven, wash them over with the yolk of an egg. 
Bake them twenty minutes in a quick oven ; have 
ready a little white gravy, seasoned with pepper, 
salt, and a little shalot, thickened with a little 
cream and butter ; as soon as the patties come out 
of the oven, make a hole in the top, and pour in 
some gravy ; you must take care not to put too 
much gravy in for fear of its running out at the 
sides, and spoiling the patties. 

340. SAVOURY PATTIES (Yorkshire, 1769) 

Take the kidney of a loin of veal before it is 
roasted, cut it in thin slices, season it with mace.

hour ; slip the rolls off the skewer, and serve with 
thick gravy. 

342. BAKED PIG'S FRY (Hertfordshire)

ounces of minced cold mutton, one ounce of ham, 
one hard-boUed egg minced, one tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley, one raw egg, pepper and salt to 
taste. If not moist enough, add a little milk. This 
may be baked in a pie-dish or steamed in a mould. 

347. FRIED SANDWICH (Hertfordshire) 
Well season a slice of cold meat or ham, spread a 
layer of mashed potato over each side, trimming 
it neatly into shape, spread with beaten raw egg,

will do) or a nice short crust, have a tin of sardines 
which have been skinned and freed from bone,

On the mushroom place a tomato which has been 
peeled, season with pepper and salt, and bake.

For each small tomato allow a slice of bacon, or 
ham ; take out the pulp of the tomatoes, mix it 
with a few white bread crumbs, a little grated cheese, 
cayenne, salt, and sugar ; a little cream or part of an 
egg may also be used if convenient, but it is not' 
necessary ; refill the tomatoes, fold the bacon 
round, and fry ; or, if frying is not liked, put a little 
fat or butter in a saucepan with the balls. Cover tke 



148 SAVOURIES 

pan closely, and let it cook gently for twenty 
minutes to half an hour, shaking the pan to prevent 
burning. Serve each ball on toast or bread. 

355. SAVOURY TONGUE (Hertfordshire) 

Take some cold cooked tongue, and cut it into 
dice, and for every half-teacupful allow a teacupful 
of good stock. Chop a little onion finely and put it in 
with the stock ; add pepper and salt to taste. Make 
it thoroughly hot, mix the meat with the well-beaten 
eggs, in the proportion of one egg to each cupful of 
tongue, and add to the stock. Stir well, and then 
put into small patty pans, sprinkle thickly with 
breadcrumbs, and scatter small bits of butter over 
the top. Bake for a quarter of an hour in a quick 
oven. 

356. A NICE WHET BEFORE DINNER 

(Eighteenth Century) 

Cut some slices of bread half an inch thick, fry 
them in butter, but not too hard ; then split some 
anchovies, take out the bones, lay half an anchovy 
on each piece of bread ; have ready some Cheshire 
cheese grated and some chopped parsley mixed 
together, lay it pretty thickly over the bread and 
anchovy, baste it with butter, and brown it with a 
salamander ; it must be done on the dish on which 
you send it to the table. 

357. SCOTCH WOODCOCK (Hertfordshire) 

Take two slices of toasted bread, rather thick, 
butter them on both sides, spread them with anchovy 
paste and place one piece on top of the other, and 



SAVOURIES 149 

cut them into fingers or squares. Take the yolks 
of two eggs well beaten, and a quarter of a pint of 
cream ; or if cream is not at hand, the yolks of 
three eggs, and a little milk will do ; set over the 
fire to thicken (but do not let it boil, else it will 
curdle) ; it should be a nice thick custard. Pour 
this over the toast, and send to table as hot as 
possible. 



CHAPTER XI 

SAUCES 

Note. — Voltaire's celebrated sneer about the 
" fifty religions and only one sauce " {i.e. melted 
butter) of the English, was in reality undeserved. 
Our forefathers were particularly keen on sauces : 
and some of these sauces were frequently so elaborate, 
so expensive, and so tedious in preparing, that I 
have refrained from setting them down. Life went 
more leisurely in those days, and the twentieth- 
century housewife finds it easier to purchase a bottle 
of some well-known condiment, such as Worcester 
or Wiltshire sauce, to expenditure of much time 
and trouble in the concoction of appetising reUshes. 
After aU, " hunger," as the proverb says, " is the 
best sauce." Amongst those here contained, how- 
ever, will be found some very meritorious recipes, 
calculated to mitigate the monotony of cold mutton, 
or to add a pleasing asperity to unexhilarating fish. 
I have included two or three ketchups and bottling 
sauces. An excellent Mayonnaise Sauce will be 
found in the salad section of this book.

of sweet herbs, a slice of the end of a lemon ; 
put in a quart of water, cover it close, let it boil

377. SAUCE FOR A GOOSE (Yorkshire, 1769)

SAUCES FOR FISH 
378. DUTCH SAUCE (Middlesex) 

Mix well together half a pound of butter, two 
tablespoonfuls of flour, and the yolks of five or six

you may throw it. 



156 SAUCES 

379. CUCUMBER GARNISH FOR FISH (Devonshire)

skim, and let the cucumber cook until tender, then 
serve round the salmon. 

380. GENEVA SAUCE FOR PISH 

Take a few mushrooms, onions, carrots sliced, 
parsley, a sprig of thyme, a bay-leaf, two ounces of 
ham, two cloves, a blade of mace, and some pepper- 
corns ; set the whole over the fire with a little butter. 
When it becomes clear, add a tablespoonful of flour, 
stir it well over the fire a few moments, and add 
enough good consomme to bring it to the consistency 
of cream. With this put half a bottle of sherry or 
Madeira. Let the whole simmer until the roots are 
done, then skim it well and strain it over whatever 
fish you have occasion to dress. When the fish is 
done, take it up carefully with a slice, drain it 
and put the sauce into a stewpan. Boil it and 
skim o& the fat. The moisture from the fish will 
thin your sauce, therefore reduce it by boiling. 
Add a little flour and butter kneaded together; 
finish with a little anchovy, butter, lemon juice, 
and cayenne, and mask the fish with it. 

381. SAUCE FOR FISH (Scotch) 

Brown four ounces of butter sUghtly, add to it an 
EngHsh pint of water, a little flour and pepper, 
three tablespoonfuls of ketchup. The fish must be 
well drained from the cold water before they are put 



SAUCES 157 

into the sauce. After they have boiled a few 
minutes, put in three or four pickled walnuts cut in 
small pieces. This sauce will be sufficient for four 
good haddocks, and may do to serve cod's head in. 

382. A VERY NICE SAUCE FOR MOST SORTS OF 
FISH (Eighteenth Century) 

Take a little gravy made of either veal or mutton, 
put to it a little of the water that drains from your 
fish ; when it is boiled enough, put it in a saucepan, 
and put in a whole onion, one anchovy, a spoonful 
of ketchup, and a glass of white wine ; thicken it 
with a good lump of butter roUed in flour and a 
spoonful of cream ; if you have oysters, cockles, or 
shrimps, put them in after you take it off the fire, 
(but it is very good without). You may use red wine 
instead of white, by leaving out the cream. 

383. WHITE FISH SAUCE (Eighteenth Century) 
Wash two anchovies, put them into a saucepan 
with one glass of white wine and two of water, half 
a nutmeg grated, and a little lemon peel ; when it 
has boiled five or six minutes strain it through a 
sieve, add to it a spoonful of white wine vinegar, 
thicken it a little, then add a quarter of a pound of 
butter rolled in flour ; boil it well, and pour it hot 
upon your dish. 

384. OYSTER SAUpE (Ireland) 
Strain the liquor from the oysters, and wash them 
in cold water. Simmer the liquor with a little mace 
and lemon-peel ; add a httle flour, and some butter 
rubbed in flour ; when this is boiled, put in the 
oysters and give one boil more. 



158 SAUCES 

385. EGG-SAUCE FOR A SALT COD 
(Eighteenth Century) 

Boil your eggs hard, first half chop the whites, 
then put in the yolks, and chop them both together, 
but not very small ; put them into half a pound of 
good creamed butter, and let it boil up ; then put it 
on the fish. 

386. LOBSTER SAUCE (Eighteenth Century) 
Boil half a pint of water with a little mace and 
whole pepper, long enough to take out the strong 
taste of the spice ; then strain it off, melt three 
quarters of a pound of butter smooth in the water, 
cut your lobster in very small pieces, stew it all 
together tenderly, with an anchovy, and send it up 
hot. (The butter in above two recipes can be reduced 
ad lib.) 

387. LOBSTER SAUCE— ANOTHER WAY 
(Eighteenth Century) 

Bruise the body of a lobster into thick melted 
butter, and cut the flesh into it in small pieces, stew 
all together and give it a boil ; season with a little 
pepper, salt, and a very small quantity of mace. 

388. SAUCE FOR SALMON (Eighteenth Century) 
Boil a bunch of fennel and parsley, chop them 
small, and put them into some good melted butter, 
send it to the table in a sauce-boat ; have another 
with gravy sauce. To make the gravy sauce, put a 
little brown gravy into a saucepan, with one anchovy, 
a teaspoonful of lemon pickle, a tablespoonful of 
liquor from walnut pickle, one or two tablespoonfuls 
of the water that the fish was boiled in (it gives a 



SAUCES 159 

pleasant flavour), a stick of horseradish, a little 
browning and salt ; boil this three or four minutes, 
thicken it with flour and a good lump of butter, 
and strain it through a hair sieve. N.B. — This is 
a good sauce for most kinds of boiled fish. 



BOTTLING SAUCES 

389. BLACK BUTTER (Middlesex) 

Put any quantity of butter required into a sauce- 
pan, and heat it over the fire until the colour has 
turned ; just before it is taken off, add a little vine- 
gar, salt, and pepper. This is the common mode of 
making black butter. But where a fine flavour is 
required, a tablespoonful or more of the vinegar 
must be used, according to the quantity of butter. 
Take a pint of white wine vinegar, put into it a 
small quantity of the usual sweet herbs, a few cloves, 
salt, pepper, and a sliced shalot. Let these stand 
in the sun for a fortnight, or infuse near the fire. 
Then strain clear off, and put into another bottle. 
This vinegar may be used with a variety of sauces. 

390. BROWNING FOR MADE DISHES 
(Eighteenth Century) 

Beat small four ounces of fine lump sugar, put 
it in a clear iron frying-pan, with one ounce of butter, 
set it over a clear fire, mix it very well together all 
the time ; when it begins to be frothy, the sugar 
is dissolving, hold it higher over the fire, have ready 
a pint of red wine ; when the sugar and butter are 
of a deep brown, pour in a little of the wine, and 
keep stirring it all the time ; put in half an ounce of 



160 SAUCES 

Jamaica pepper, six cloves, four shalots peeled, 
two or three blades of mace, three spoonfuls of 
mushroom ketchup, a little salt, the rind of one 
lemon ; boil it slowly for ten minutes, pour it into a 
basin ; when cold, take off the scum very clean, and 
bottle the sauce for use. 

391. EXCELLENT BOTTLING SAUCE (Kent, 1809) 

One quart bottle of porter or ale, two pounds of 
anchovies, one bottle of port wine, one quart of 
vinegar, a quarter of an ounce of mace, half an ounce 
of allspice, two or three Jamaica peppers, the rind 
of five or sis lemons pared thin ; all put together and 
boiled down to half, strained through a cloth bag, 
boiled again with white pepper. Bottle it when 
cold. It will keep very long. 

392. BOTTLED FISH SAUCE (Kent) 

Half a pint of walnut pickle, six anchovies pounded, 
three cloves of garlic pounded, three not pounded, 
one spoonful of cayenne pepper, all mixed well, 
and bottled for use. A tablespoonful in a boat of 
melted butter is sufficient. 

393. riSH SAUCE FOR BOTTLING (Kent, 1809) 

Take walnuts fit for pickling, beat them well in 
a mortar till they are pulped, squeeze the juice from 
them and let it stand a day. Pour it off clear, and 
to every pint of liquor put one pound of anchovies 
with an ounce of shalots ; set it on the fire till the 
anchovies are quite dissolved, strain it clear, and to 
every quart put a quarter of an ounce of cloves, mace 



SAUCES 161 

and allspice, and half a pint of white wine vinegar. 
Let them boil all together for a quarter of an hour, 
then put in glass bottles for use. 

394. KING'S OWN SAUCE (Hampshire) 
Fill a quart bottle with nasturtium flowers, and 
half an ounce of shalots ; cover them with vinegar and 
let it stand two months. Then strain, and add to the 
liquor one ounce of salt, one teaspoonful of cayenne 
pepper, and four ounces of soy. To be eaten with 
either hot or cold meat. 

396. LIVER KETCHUP (Lancashire) 
Take a bullock's liver, wash it extremely well, 
then put it with some salt in four quarts of water. 
Let it simmer away one-half, carefully skimming it 
all the time. Strain it through a hair-sieve, and 
let it stand till next day, then pour it gently into a 
saucepan with spice, a clove of garlic, a few bay 
leaves, and a bit of horseradish. When boiled 
enough to season it, let it stand till cold and bottle 
it for use. 

396. MUSHROOM KETCHUP (Surrey) 
Having skinned and peeled some large field mush- 
rooms, crush them into a pulp, adding a table- 
spoonful of salt to every quart of pulp : let them 
stand for a day and a night, then pour off the clear 
liquor, and add to every quart about twenty cloves, 
thirty peppercorns, and the same quantity of all- 
spice : boil very gently for about half an hour, 
then put into bottles with the spices. Some persons 
add port wine, but this rather injures than improves 
11 



162 SAUCES 

the flavour, and is objectionable for many sauces. 
A little mace may be added, but it is not essential. 

397. TOMATO SAUCE FOR BOTTLING (Essex) 

Take ten pounds of ripe tomatoes, and to this 
quantity allow one pint of best brown vinegar, half 
a pound of white sugar, two ounces of salt, one 
ounce of garlic, one ounce of allspice, half an ounce 
of black pepper, half an ounce of cloves, and a 
quarter of an ounce of cayenne pepper. Wipe the 
tomatoes clean, and bake them in an oven till they 
are soft enough to be rubbed through a fine sieve 
which will retain the seeds and skins. Boil the juice 
for one hour, then add the other ingredients. All 
the spices must be ground, and the garlic peeled 
and pounded to a pulp. 

Now boil the whole mixture together, stirring 
constantly to prevent burning, and continue the 
boihng till you get a thick smooth mass free from 
watery particles ; it will take about five hours 
boiling. If you desire a bright colour, add a Uttle 
prepared cochineal. This is one of the very best 
keeping tomato sauces you can make. 

It is to be bottled without further straining. 
The bottles must be absolutely dry inside before 
you put the sauce in them. When cold, cork 
securely and seal or resin over the corks. 

SWEET SAUCES 

398. BRANDY SAUCE (Hertfordshire) 

Take a quarter of a pound of fresh butter, beat 

it to a cream, add two and a half ounces of crushed 

loaf sugar, and a glassful of brandy, mix all well 



SAUCES 163 

together. The spirits must be added but a little 
at a time. 

399. CARAMEL SAUCE (Hertfordshire) 
Make a caramel with twelve lumps of sugar, a 
tablespoonful of water, and a little lemon juice ; 
boil until it gets a nice brown, then add a quarter of 
a pint of milk, add this to two yolks of eggs beaten 
well. Strain through muslin. This makes a nice 
sauce to any plain pudding. 

400. GINGER SAUCE (Hertfordshire) 
Two ounces crystallised ginger, two ounces loaf 
sugar, half a pint of water, a few drops of caramel. 
Boil, stirring constantly, in lined pan. 

401. ORANGE SAUCE (Sussex) 

The unexpected virtues of orange sauce were first 
appreciated by a Patagonian explorer, who, left 
stranded with his only remaining stores, a West- 
phaUan ham and a few oranges, concocted a sauce 
with the fruit which proved a most ideal accompani- 
ment to the ham. It improves the flavour of wild 
duck, of goose, turkey, and saddle of mutton ; and 
is a first-rate sauce with plum-pudding, while in 
America they use it as a wholesome adjunct to 
stewed raisins, prunes, and stewed grapes, both as 
a breakfast and a luncheon dish. 

To make orange sauce, mix one level tablespoonful 
of flour with half a cupful of sugar. Add at once 
half a pint of quite boiling water, and the grated 
rind of half an orange. Stir and boil four minutes, 
and add the juice of an orange, and a large dessert- 
spoonful of butter, and pour while hot over a well- 



164 SAUCES 

beaten egg. This will be only sufficient for four 
persons. The sauce, poured over apple pudding, 
apple pie, or stewed apples, gives a pineapple flavour 
to the whole. 



402. RASPBERRY SAUCE (Hertfordshire) 

Two tablespoonfuls of raspberry jam, one ounce 
of loaf sugar, gill of water, one tablespoonful of 
lemon juice. Boil quickly in lined pan. 

403. SARACEN SAUCE (Fourteenth century, 
modernised) 

Take rose-hips, and clean them (by pulping 
through a sieve). Take the same amount of blanched 
almonds, fry them in oil, and bray them with the 
hips in a mortar. Boil them up with red wine, and 
put in sufficient sugar, and powdered hot spices 
(such as ginger, pepper, etc.). Mix all stiff with 
rice-flour, colour with alkanet or cochineal, and 
serve. 

404. SAUCE FOR HOT PUDDING (Hertfordshire) 

Glass of wine, two yolks of eggs, lemon juice, 
a little sugar ; whisk till thick. 



CHAPTER XII 
PICKLES 

Note.— The love of pickles is sometimes con- 
sidered the sign of a depraved taste : certainly it is 
a very widespread depravity. The desire for some- 
thing at once hot, sour, salt, and pungent, would seem 
to be an inherent principle of human nature. We 
do not go to such lengths as the Germans in their 
affection for vinegary compounds : but (among our 
working classes in particular) we undoubtedly give 
way to an omnivorous appetite for pickles. 

That the home-made pickle is superior from every 
possible point of view to the " boughten " one, as 
they say in the West Country, is a foregone con- 
clusion. Although all pickly concoctions tend 
towards obscure dyspeptic ailments, yet the home- 
made article, partaken of in moderation, is at least 
not actively deleterious : containing no artificial 
colourings, no illicitly procured greens of vivid hue, 
no doubtful ingredients of any sort : just good plain 
vegetables in a good clean pickling mixture. Any 
reader who makes proof of the praiseworthy pickle 
prescriptions herewith, will unquestionably reap 
the reward of her labours. 

405. PICKLED BEET ROOT (Middlesex) 

Boil the root until the skin can be removed 
easily : having removed the skin, cut the root into 

16S 



166 PICKLES 

slices, and put them into salt and water for twelve 
hours, drain them, put them into a jar, and pour 
over them (cold) white wine vinegar, previously boiled 
with whole pepper and ginger. For a quart of 
vinegar, use half an ounce of pepper, and a good- 
sized piece of white ginger : if the beet root be red, 
use black pepper : but if white, the contrary. Any 
other root, such as carrot, parsnip, turnip, etc., may 
be pickled in the same manner. 

406. PICKLED CABBAGES (Middlesex) 

Shred the inner leaves pf good firm red cabbage, 
sprinkle them plentifully with salt, and let them lie 
on a sieve for a day : put them into the jar, and cover 
with vinegar which has been boiled with whole black 
pepper, ginger, and cloves. The proportions are 
half an ounce of pepper, a drachm of ginger, and a 
drachm of cloves, to a quart of vinegar. The 
quantity of cloves may be increased for those who 
like the flavour. The vinegar should be poured 
over cold. Do not, either in this or in any other 
recipe for pickling, strain off the spices : they are 
to be put into the jar with the vinegar. 

407. PICKLED RED CABBAGE (Essex) 

The ingredients are red cabbages, salt, water, and 
vinegar. To each quart of vinegar, half an ounce of 
ginger well bruised, one ounce of whole black pepper, 
and, when liked, a little cayenne. Take off the outside 
decayed leaves of a nice red cabbage, cut it into quar- 
ters, remove its stalks, and cut it across in very thin 
slices. Lay these on a dish and strew them plenti- 
fully with salt, covering them with another dish. 



PICKLES 167 

Let them remain for twenty-four hours, turn into a 
colander to drain, and if necessary wipe them lightly 
•with a clean soft cloth ; put them in a jar. Boil up 
the vinegar with spices in the above proportions, 
and when cold pour it over the cabbage. It will 
be fit for use in a week or two. If kept for a very 
long time, the cabbage is liable to get soft and to 
discolour. To be really nice and crisp and of a good 
red colour, it should be eaten almost immediately 
after it is made. A little bruised cochineal boiled 
with the vinegar adds much to its appearance. Tie 
down with bladder and keep in a dry place. 



408. PICKLED CAULLFLOWER (Middlesex) 

Having trimmed the cauliflower, put it into salt 
and water for twelve hours : then put it either 
whole, or in detached parts, according to the size, 
into a jar, and pour over (cold) white wine vinegar, 
previously boiled with whole white pepper. In this, 
as in all other cases, tie over with wet bladder and 
leather : and whenever the bladder is removed to 
take out any of the pickle, wet the bladder again 
so that it may adhere firmly. The cauliflower is 
sometimes about half boiled in strong salt and 
water, before the vinegar is put upon it. 

409. CHUTNEY (Kent) 

Five pounds of apples (green), five pounds of 
tomatoes, two and a half pounds of sugar, two and 
a half pounds of sultanas, four ounces of garlic, or ten 
ounces of onions, ten ounces of salt, two ounces of 
cayenne, two ounces of ginger, three pints of vinegar. 



168 PICKLES 

410. BENGAL CHUTNEY (Surrey) 

One pound of brown sugar, half a pound of salt, 
half a pound of mustard-seed, washed and pounded : 
half a garlic, or quarter of a pound of onions chopped 
finely, quarter of a pound of powdered ginger, 
half a pound of raisins, stoned and chopped, one 
ounce of cayenne pepper, three pints of vinegir ; 
thirteen large sour apples, peeled, cored, and cut up, 
then boiled till tender in the vinegar, and, when 
tender, bruised with a spoon to a smooth pulp. 
When cold, mix all the ingredients together, and 
cover them lightly for a day or two. Then put 
into jars and cover down tightly. It is best to 
make half this quantity at a time. Mustard flour 
may be used instead of mustard seed, and onions 
instead of garlic. 



411. BENGAL CHUTNEY (Devonshire) 

Three quarters of a pound of Demerara sugar, six 
ounces of mustard seed, two ounces of dried chillies, 
four ounces of onions, six oimces of stoned raisins, 
fifteen large unripe sour apples, six ounces of ground 
ginger, one bottle best vinegar. The sugar must be 
made into syrup ; the onion and ginger must be finely 
pounded in a mortar ; the mustard-seed must be 
washed in cold vinegar and dried in the sun ; the 
apples to be peeled, cored, and sliced, and boiled in 
half a bottle of vinegar. When the apples are 
cold, put them into a large pan and gradually mix 
in all the ingredients, including the half bottle of 
vinegar. It must be well stirred until all is thor- 
oughly blended. Then bottle for uge. One pound 



PICKLES 169 

of tomatoes added to the apples and raisins (after 
they are cooked), put through a sieve, then gradually 
mixed all together, is a great improvement. 

412. TOMATO CHUTNEY (Sussex) 

Ingredients. — Three and a half pounds of green 
tomatoes, one teaspoonful of mustard-seed, one 
teaspoonful of ground ginger, one teaspoonful of 
allspice, one onion, one quart of vinegar, ten cloves, 
and a pound of brown sugar. 

Method. — Peel and cut the tomatoes, put into the 
preserving pan with vinegar and spices. When 
nearly boihng, add sugar, and the onion whole. Boil 
gently for about two hours. Remove the onion 
before it breaks. Put into small pots and tie down. 
If ripe tomatoes are used, less vinegar is required. 

413. TO PICKLE GHERKINS (Surrey) 

Put a quantity of spring water into a large earthen 
pan. To every gallon put two pounds of salt : mix 
them well together, and throw in five hundred 
gherkins. When they have lain two hours in the 
salt and water, put them to drain. When they are 
quite dry, put them into a jar. Take one gallon of 
white wine vinegar, put it into a saucepan with haK 
an ounce of cloves, half an ounce of mace, one ounce 
of allspice, one ounce of mustard-seed, one stick 
of horseradish cut in slices, two or three races of 
ginger, six bay leaves, one nutmeg cut in pieces, and 
a handful of salt. Boil up all together, and pour 
it over the gherkins. Cover them close down and 
let them stand twenty-four hours. Then put them 
in your saucepan, and do not let them boU (for that 



170 PICKLES 

would spoil them), but simmer till they are of a fine 
green. Put them hot in the jars, over which put 
plates. When cold, cover them with bladder. 

414. INDIAN PICKLE (Middlesex) 

Boil in salt and water, for a quarter of an hour, 
a cauliflower, two summer cabbages, six heads of 
celery, a quart of French beans, and two sticks of 
sKced horseradish ; drain and dry in the sun, or by 
the fire, until very crisp, having first divided the 
vegetables into small neat pieces : half a pound of 
garlic is to be put into salt for three days, and dried 
in the same way : have ready in a jar half a pound 
of bruised and washed whole ginger, two ounces of 
bruised mustard-seed, two ounces of turmeric, two 
ounces of black pepper, a quarter of an ounce of 
cayenne pepper, and an ounce of allspice : sprinkle 
these with salt, and let them stand for a day before 
the vegetables are added : then put in the vegetables, 
and pour over them, boiling hot, two quarts of the 
strongest white wine vinegar. 

416. LEMON PICKLE (Eighteenth Century) 

Take two dozen lemons, grate off the outer rind 
very thin, cut them in four quarters, and leave 
the bottoms whole ; rub on them equally half a pound 
of bay salt, and spread them on a large dish. Put 
them in a cool oven, or let them dry gradually by the 
fire till all the juice is dried into the peels ; then put 
them into a well-glazed pitcher (or jar), with one ounce 
of mace, half an ounce of cloves beat fine, one ounce 
of nutmeg cut in thin slices, four ounces of garlic 
peeled, half a pint of mustard-seed, bruised a little 



PICKLES 171 

and tied in a muslin bag ; pour four quarts of boiling 
white wine vinegar upon them, close the pitcher 
well up, and let it stand five or six days by the fire ; 
shake it well up every day ; then tie it up, and let 
it stand for three months to take off the bitter taste. 
When you bottle it, put the pickle and lemon in a 
hair sieve, press them well, to take out the liquor, 
and let it stand till another day, then pour off the 
clear part, and bottle it ; let the rest stand three or 
four days and it will refine itself, then pour it off and 
bottle it ; let it stand again, and bottle it, till the 
whole is refined : it may be put in any white sauce, 
and will not hurt the colour. It is very good for 
fish sauce and made dishes ; a teaspoonful is enough 
for white, and two for brown sauce for fowl. It is a 
most useful pickle, and gives a pleasant flavour ; 
be sure you put it in before you thicken the sauce, or 
put any cream in, lest the sharpness make it curdle. 



416. LYONS PICKLE (French) 
(Generally called Yellow Pickle) 

Take a large cauliflower, two heads of cabbages, 
and five or six carrots cut into neat pieces, a quart 
of French beans sliced, a pint of green peas (if in 
season) and three or four ounces of garlic : cover 
a sieve with a layer of salt, and put them upon it ; 
then sprinkle them with salt plentifully. After they 
have lain in this way for two days, divide them into 
two or three sieves, and place them in the sun to dry 
for ten or twelve days : put them into a jar with a 
quarter of a pound of white mustard-seed or three 
ounces of the seed, and one of ginger, two ounces of 
turmeric, and two teaspoonfuls of cayenne pepper ; 



172 PICKLES 

a quart of young onions prepared as for pickling may 
be added. Pour over sufficient boiling vinegar to 
cover them completely, and leave about an inch or 
two of liquid above the vegetables. 

417. TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS (Sussex) 
Put the smallest you can get into a pan of spring 
water, and rub them with a piece of flannel dipped 
in salt, and when well washed, set them on the fire 
in a pan of boiling water, with a little salt in it. 
When they have boiled five or six minutes, lay them 
on a colander to drain. Then lay them between 
two cloths till they are cold. Put them in wide- 
mouthed bottles with a few blades of mace and some 
sliced nutmeg ; fill the bottles with vinegar, and cork 
them down. 

418. TO PICKLE MUSHROOMS BROWN (Surrey) 
Shake a little salt over, and leave them till next 
day ; then stick an onion full of cloves, which put 
with them into a skillet, and let them stew very 
well ; then add some vinegar, and let that also stew 
for some time. 

419. NASTURTIUM BUDS (SEEDS) PICKLED 
(Yorkshire, 1769) 

Gather your little knobs quickly after the blossoms 
are off, put them in cold water and salt for three days, 
shifting them once a day. Then make a pickle for 
them (but don't boil them at all), of some white 
wine and some white wine vinegar, shalot, horse- 
radish, whole pepper, salt, and a blade or two of 
mace. Then put in your seeds, and stopper them 
close up. They are to be eaten as capers. 



PICKLES 173 

420. PICKLED YOUNG ONIONS (Middlesex) 

Peel them, and steep them in strong salt and 
water for four days, changing the water two or three 
times ; wipe them perfectly dry and put them into 
milk which is scalding hot, until the milk becomes 
cold : now drain them, and dry each separately in 
a cloth ; after which put them into jars, pour as 
much white wine vinegar (which has been boiled with 
white pepper), as wiU cover them completely ; tie 
over first with wet bladder, and then with leather, 
and keep the jars in a dry place for use : a little 
ginger may be added. Some persons put the onions, 
without peeling, into cold water, and keep them on 
the fire till the water boils : then they take off the 
outer skins, and steep them in salt and water 
before adding the vinegar. 

421. PICKLED PRUNES (Ireland) 

One pound of prunes, haK a pound of sugar, a 
little cinnamon, a few cloves. Wash the primes, 
prick them with a needle. One pint of vinegar to 
four pounds of prunes. Boil all together without 
the prunes ; throw it boiling over them. Let it 
stand a night, then boil all together very slowly 
till the skin is a Uttle broken. When done, cover 
it well. 



422. TO PICKLE SAMPHIRE (Eighteenth Century) 

Wash your samphire well in sour small beer, 
then put it into a large preserving pan, dissolve a 
little bay salt and twice the quantity of common 



174 PICKLES 

salt in sour beer, then fill up your pan with it, cover 
it close, and set it over a slow fire till it is of a fine 
green. Drain it through a sieve, and put it into 
jars. Boil as much white wine vinegar as will be 
sufficient to cover it, with a race or two of ginger, 
and a few peppercorns. Pour this hot upon your 
samphires in the jars, and tie them down. 



423. PICKLED GREEN WALNUTS (Surrey) 

Gather green walnuts before the inner shell is 
formed, which may be known by pricking them with 
a pin ; if it goes through easily, they are young 
enough to pickle. Prick them in several places 
with a needle or pin, to allow them to imbibe the 
salt, and put them in strong brine for a fortnight, 
making fresh salt and water every three days : 
drain them, and put them in a jar, sprinkle them 
with salt, and pour over (hot) vinegar boiled as for 
cabbage ; some shalots, garlic, or onion may be 
boiled in the vinegar, if the flavour is not disliked. 
Some persons dry the walnuts in the sun for three 
or four days, after having left the brine, and before 
the vinegar is added. 

424. RIPE WALNUT PICKLE (Middlesex) 

Pound the rinds of ripe walnuts in a mortar with a 
little salt ; then add water by degrees, and continue 
to pound the whole together ; pass the whole through 
a sieve, so as to get out a strong liquor ; boil this 
with ginger, horseradish and sweet herbs, white 
pepper, a few cloves, and salt, for half an hour very 
slowly ; strain and put it into bottle, adding the 



PICKLES 175 

spice ; the trouble of pounding may be avoided by 
putting the rinds bruised into a tub with a little 
salt, and sufficient water to cover them, and straining 
off the liquor at the end of a few days. (This is 
so far as the recipe goes : but I presume the kernels 
are separately pickled as above (see " Green Wal- 
nuts "), and this liquor is subsequently added. Ed.) 



425. VEGETABLE MARROW PICKLE (Sussex) 

Take a good-sized marrow and cut it up into 
small cubes, none more than two and a half inches 
long. Put it into a preserving pan, with a layer 
of Demerara sugar upon each layer of marrow, and 
enough vinegar to cover it. Let it cook thus until 
completely tender ; then add some stoned raisins, 
mixed spices, ginger, salt, and pepper, and let it go 
on boiling until it is quite thick and stiff. Take 
it off and let it cool down a little before bottling. 



426. PICKLING MIXTURES (Surrey) 

I 

Twenty quarts of spring water, three pounds of 
coarse brown sugar, quarter of a poimd of saltpetre, 
two pounds of bay salt. 

II 

One stone of common salt, quarter of a stone of 
bay salt, four ounces of saltpetre, half a pound of 
brown sugar, to four gallons of water. 



176 PICKLES 



III 



Half a pound of salt, two ounces of ginger, two 
ounces of shalots, two ounces of mustard-seed, one 
ounce of white pepper, one tablespoonful of cayenne 
pepper, boiled together in two quarts of vinegar. 
All the vegetables except onions may be put in it, 
merely first wiping them dry. Put the pickle before 
the fire for nine days to give it a good colour. It 
will keep for years. 



CHAPTER XIII 
PUDDINGS 

Note. — The pudding, from time immemorial, has 
been an English dish par excellence ; and our fore- 
fathers simply ran riot in puddings. I have declined 
the insertion of puddings which would make the 
boldest stand aghast, from their daring novelty in 
the way of ill-matched ingredients, or their excursion 
far afield into realms of indefensible costliness. 
The vast number of recipes which are offered to the 
reader, represent a wide and comprehensive range, 
the Poles of the pudding world ; it will be seen 
how many counties have contributed their quota 
to this remarkably extensive list. I should like 
to underline the respective merits of very many : 
but here, as in all else, " the proof of the pudding 
is in the eating." As sheer curiosities, I have 
included two rice puddings — one boiled, one baked, 
dating from about the year 1820,' in Dublin. These 
are, I fancy, quite unparalleled, and I am loth that 
the recipes should be lost. 

427. ALBERT PUDDING (Yorkshire) 

Take six eggs, six apples, six ounces of bread 
finely grated, six ounces stoned currants (raisins ?), 
four ounces of sugar, a little salt and nutmeg. 
12 177 



178 PUDDINGS 

To be boiled slowly for three hours. Eaten with 
melted butter. 

428. APPLE AMBER (Hertfordshire) 

Strip of rough puff pastry, one pound of apples, 
two ounces of butter, two ounces of sugar, two eggs, 
two ounces of bread crumbs, a little grated lemon 
rind. Line the sides of a pie-dish with the strip of 
pastry, decorating the edge. Peel, core, and cut 
up the apples. Stew these until quite tender, add 
the sugar, butter, bread crumbs, and yolks of eggs. 
Place this mixture in the pie-dish and bake for half 
an hour. Beat up the whites stiffly, and two 
tablespoonfuls of sugar. Pile this meringue on top 
of the apple mixture, and set slowly in a cool oven. 
Decorate with cherries, and angehca. N.B. — This 
pudding is excellent hot or cold. 

429. BUTTERED APPLES (French) 

Take some middle-sized apples, peel and core 
them, and put them on little round sHces of bread 
which have had all the crust taken off. Put in each 
apple as much butter and sugar as it will hold. 
Cook them in a good oven on a buttered tin, and 
before serving put a teaspoonful of red currant 
jelly in each apple. 

430. APPLE DOWDY (Essex) 

Take about one and a half pounds of apples, 
slices of stale bread and butter, a little nutmeg, 
one gill of water, one gill of golden syrup, two ounces 
of Demerara sugar. Well butter a deep baking 



PUDDINGS 179 

tin or pie-dish. Line the bottom with the thin 
shoes of bread and butter. Peel, core, and slice the 
apples, and nearly fill the dish with them. Grate 
over a little nutmeg. Now mix the syrup and water, 
pour it in over the apples. Put the sugar in a layer 
on the top, and cover all with more bread and 
butter. Cover the top over with a tin plate or lid, 
and bake in a moderate oven about two hours. 
Then loosen the edges with a knife, put on a hot 
dish, and serve with sugar and cream ; or it can be

CHAPTER XIV 

PASTRY AND SWEET DISHES 

Under this heading are a few recipes which do 
not fall exactly under the head of puddings ; some 
of these wiU be found a most welcome change 
from the ordinary round of things, especially the 
fruit dishes and the " Treacle-George," which is 
immensely popular iq those families favoured by 
its acquaintance. 

For making short crust, good beef-dripping is 
much superior to lard or butter ; a mixture of 
beef and mutton dripping, plus bacon-fat or lard, 
run down and clarified, is the best thing possible 
for meat-pies. For puff pastry the best lard or butter 
only should be used : it is cheapest in the end. Flour 
should be slightly warmed before using, as directed 
for cakes. But the baking is quite as important as 
the making : and if an oven door be left ajar, or 
open too long, or if articles are taken out of the 
oven, and carelessly set in a draughty place, the 
best batch of pastry may be ruined. 

PASTRY 

534. OBSERVATIONS ON PIES (Eighteenth Century) 

Raised pies should have a quick oven, kept well 

closed up, or your pie will fall in at the sides ; it 

213 



214 PASTRY AND SWEET DISHES 

should have no water put in till the minute it goes 
to the oven, or else it makes the crust sad, and it is 
a great hazard of the pie running. Light paste 
requires a moderate oven ; but not too slow, or it 
will make it sad, and a quick oven will catch and 
burn it, and not give it time to rise. Tarts that 
are iced, require a slow oven, or the icing will 
brown, and the paste not be nearly baked. This 
sort of tarts ought to be made of sugar paste, 
rolled very thin. 

535. APPLE TART (French Method) 
Scald eight or ten large apples, and when cold 
mash them with a spoon : then add to them the 
yolks of four and the whites of two eggs, and mW 
the whole well together, adding grated nutmeg and 
sugar to taste : cover the inside and edges of a 
tart-dish with puff-paste, filling the dish with the 
mixture ; bake for an hour, and before serving 
cover with powdered sugar. 

636. ALMOND CHEESECAKES (Yorkshire) 
Four ounces of almonds blanched and beaten in a 
mortar along with four ounces of sugar ; add four 
ounces of butter, the grated rind of a lemon, and 
three eggs, all beaten well together in a mortar. 
Put a thin puff paste at the bottom of tins, and 
insert the mixture. 

537. APPLE CHEESECAKE MIXTURE 
(Gloucestershire) 

Four ounces of apple pulp, two ounces of castor 
sugar, two eggs, two ounces of butter. The grated 



PASTRY AND SWEET DISHES 215 

rind and juice of a lemon. Pare, core, and slice half 
a pound of apples and stew with little water till 
soft. Weigh four ounces, put back the apples in 
pan — add sugar and butter and stir (one way only) 
till butter is melted. Put mixture in basin, add 
grated riad and juice of lemon and beaten eggs. 
Stir with a wooden spoon till well mixed. Line 
tart tins with short pastry, place a little mixture 
in each, and bake in quick oven. 

638. LEMON CHEESECAKES (Hertfordshire) 
Half a pound of sugar, two ounces of butter, rind 
of two lemons, half a dozen grated almonds, juice 
of three lemons, three eggs, one cracker biscuit. 
Grate lemons, almonds, and biscuits, then mix 
together and stir over the fire until it thickens, 

539. LEMON CHEESE (Isle of Wight) 
Put into a saucepan half a poimd of castor sugar, 
two beaten eggs, three ounces of butter, and the 
juice and rind (grated) of a lemon. Bring it to the 
boil slowly, until it looks thick (like honey). Then 
put into jars, and cover down. This is used for 
filling open tarts and cheese cakes. 

640. LEMON CURD (Essex) 
Take two ounces of fresh butter, three beaten 
yolks of eggs, the juice and grated rind of two lemons, 
half a pound of castor sugar. Mix well, and put 
the mixture into a jar, and stand it in a saucepan 
of boihng water over a slow fire, till the mixture 
is like a thick cream. Put it into pots and cover 
closely.

643. CODLING PIE (Eighteenth Century) 
Gather small codlings, put them in a small pre- 
serving pan with cold water, lay vine leaves on them, 
and cover them with a cloth wrapped roimd the cover 
of the pan to keep in the steam ; when they grow 
softish, peel off the skin, and put them in the same 
water as the vine leaves, hang them up a great 
height over the fire to green. When you see them a 
fine green, take them out of the water, and put them 
in a deep dish, with as much powder or loaf sugar, as 
will sweeten them. Make the lid of rich puff paste, 
and bake it ; when it comes from the oven, take off 
the lid, and cut it in pieces like sippets, and stick 
them round the inside of the pie, with the points 
upward. Pour over your codlings, a good custard 
made thus : Boil a pint of cream, with a stick of 
cinnamon, and sugar enough to make it a little 
sweet ; let it stand till cold, then put in the yolks 



PASTRY AND SWEET DISHES 217 

of four eggs well beaten, set it on the fire, and keep 
stirring it tUl it grows tMck, but do not let it boil, 
lest it curdle ; then pour it into your pie. Pare a little 
lemon-peel thin, cut the peel like straws, and lay 
it over the top of your codlings. 

644. EGG PIES (Yorkshire, 1769) 
Boil half a dozen eggs, half a dozen apples, one 
and a haK pounds of beef-suet, a pound of currants, 
and shred (finely mince) them. Season with mace, 
nutmeg, and sugar to your taste, a tablespoonful 
or two of brandy, and sweetmeats, if you please. 
Make into pies (like mince-pies). 

646. LEMON PIE (Surrey) 
Take two lemons, grate off the outer peel, chop 
the rest very fine. Put two tablespoonfuls of corn- 
starch to a teacupful of hot water, and boil ; when 
cool, add two teacupfuls of white sugar, and the 
beaten yolks of four eggs. Then add the chopped 
peel and the juice. Stir well together, bake till the 
crust is done. Beat the whites of eggs to a stiff 
froth ; stir well in five tablespoonfuls of sugar ; pour 
this over the pie while hot, and set it back in the 
oven to brown. 

546. LEMON TARTLETS (Lancashire) 
Take the juice and grated rinds of two lemons. 
Clean the grater with bread, only using sufficient 
crumbs to take off all the lemon peel. Beat all to- 
gether with two eggs, half a pound of loaf sugar, and 
quarter of a pound of butter. This is sufficient to 
make twelve tarts.

Chop fine three pounds of suet, and three pounds 
of pared and cored apples. Wash and dry three 
pounds of currants, stone and chop one pound of 
raisins, beat and sift one pound and a half of loaf 
sugar, cut small twelve ounces of candied orange 
peel and six ounces of citron ; mix all well to- 
gether, with a quarter of an ounce of nutmeg, 
half an ounce of cinnamon, six or eight cloves, and 
half a pint of French brandy; put it into closed 
jar, and keep it for use. 



648. MINCEMEAT (Hertfordshire) 

Five pounds of suet, two pounds of raisins, two 
pounds of sultanas, two pounds of currants, three 
pounds of apples, three pounds of Demerara, two 
povmds of pears, two pounds of candied peel, one 
and a half poimds of almonds, half an ounce of 
mixed spice, four pounds of lemons, four poimds of 
oranges, two pints of brandy, one pint of sherry, 
four wineglassfuls of maraschino or noyeau. 



549. NEW ENGLAND MOLASSES PIE (American) 

Line a deep pie-dish with an undercrust, mix half 
a pint of treacle with a tablespoonful of flour, add 
the juice of a lemon, and the rind and juicy pulp 
chopped fine, (do not use any of the white pith). 
Moisten the edges, and cover with a crust ; bake, 
and eat while hot. 



PASTRY AND SWEET DISHES 219 

650. ORANGE PIE (Surrey) 

Take the juioe and grated rind of one orange, one 
small cup of sugar, yolks of three eggs, one table- 
spoonful of corn-starch, made smooth with milk ; a 
piece of butter as large as a chestnut, and one cupful 
of milk. Beat the whites of the three eggs with four 
tablespoonfuls of sugar, and place on the top after 
the pie is baked, leaving it in the oven until browned. 



651. SWISS RHUBARB TART (Hertfordshire) 

Make a tart in the usual way, sweeten the rhubarb 
and flavour it with some slices of lemon rind. 
When cold, cut off the top crust, and leave the edge 
quite neat. Beat up the juice with a fork. Take 
a gill of cream, or more if the tart be large, slightly 
sweeten it, and whip till stiff. Pile this roughly 
over the sweet ; garnish with strips of angelica and 
preserved cherries, and serve. 



562. TART OF ROSE-HIPS (Seventeenth Century) 

Take some hips, cut them and take out the seeds 
very clean. Wash them, season with sugar, cinna- 
mon, and ginger. Cover the tart and bake it, ice 
it, sprinkle sugar on, and serve it. (Water has been 
omitted. I should advise giving the hips a pre- 
liminary cooking and pulping through a sieve. 
Hose-hips need very careful removal of the irritating 
hair in which the seeds are enveloped ; but this 
should come out as a whole if they are ripe. Ed.)

553. SULTANA PUETS (Surrey) 

Excellent and wholesome puffs can be made, to 
use up any short crust left over from a pie, by rolling 
out the paste a quarter of an inch thick, cutting it 
in rounds, and placing about one heaped table- 
spoonful of picked sultanas in the centre of each. 
Moisten the edges and turn over in three flaps, to 
make a three-cornered puff. Bake in moderate oven. 

654. SUSSEX PANCAKES (Seventeenth Century) 

Take some very good pie paste made with hot 
lard and roll it thin ; fry it in butter, and serve it 
with beaten spice and sugar as hot as you can. 

555. TREACLE-GEORGE (Devonshire) 

Take a shallow cake-tin, or a deep plate, or a 
pie-dish ; butter it. Place at the bottom a layer of 
pastry (short-crust) about a quarter of an inch thick. 
Over this put a layer of treacle ; over this a layer of 
fine bread crumbs, sufficient to hide the treacle ; over 
this squeeze a little lemon-juice ; then put a layer 
of pastry, and go on in the same rotation till the 
tin is filled up to the height of three or four inches 
or so. Bake in a fairly quick oven, and remove from 
tin, and serve either hot or cold. This is a whole- 
some and attractive dish for children. 

656. TO MAKE CRISP PASTE FOR TARTS 
(Eighteenth Century) 

Take one pound of fine flour, mixed with one 
ounce of sifted sugar, make it into a stiff paste, 
with a gill of boiling cream and three ounces of 



PASTEY AND SWEET DISHES 221 

butter ; work it well, and roll it very thin. When 
you have made your tarts, beat the white of 
an egg a little, rub it over them with a feather, sift 
a little sugar over them, and bake in a moderate 
oven. 

For icing : Beat the white of an egg to a strong 
froth, put in by decrees four ounces of sifted sugar, 
with as much powdered gum as will lie on sixpence, 
beat it half an hour, then lay it over your tarts the 
thickness of a straw. 

557. VEGETABLE-MARROW TART (Sussex) 

Take a small marrow, stew it quite tender, mash 
it up with butter and sugar to taste, add a little 
flavouring of lemon, spice, and ginger, and beat an 
egg-yolk well in. Make tartlets of puff paste in 
patty pans, or line a dish with puff-paste, and when 
the pastry is baked and has gone cool, fill it with 
above mixture, and put it back for a minute in the 
oven. The whipped white of egg can be laid on 
top, if liked. 

FRUIT DISHES 

558. SCRAPED APPLES (Surrey) 

Take one pound of good eating apples, peel them, 
and scrape or shred them finely with a sharp knife 
into a glass dish. Have ready, not too hot, a nice 
two-egg custard, flavoured with sugar and vanilla, 
and pour this at once over the apples, as they dis- 
colour while exposed to the air. Let them be 
welt covered with the custard. This is a most 
delicious and wholesome dish, and will suit invaUds.

559. SIMPLE RECIPES FOR COOKING JAMAICA 
BANANAS 

By a Black Lady 

1. As a Vegetable, wholesome, and filling. Peel 
green bananas, boil them in salt and water until soft 
like potatoes. Are good mashed with butter and 
peppernut. 

2. Fried Bananas. These are what children 
like. Ripe bananas, sliced lengthways, and fried 
in lard. Eaten either with meat, or served with 
sugar sprinkled on them. A squeeze of lemon is an 
improvement. 

3. Baked Bananas. Fit for the gods ! Peel 
ripe bananas and place in a pie-dish. Sprinkle a 
little lemon juice over them (also sugar), half cover 
with water, bake for twenty minutes. When cool, 
serve with custard, cream, or milk. 

4. Banana Fritters. If well made are tip-top. 
Dip them whole or sliced in batter. Ery until 
crisp and light brown. 

560. DATE CAKE (Somerset) 

One pound of cheap dates, 3d. per pound, two 
ounces (sweet) almonds, blanched. Grease a small 
pudding basin with cooldng butter (basin should be 
a little larger than a breakfastcup). Make a cross 
in it with spUt blanched almonds, thus, +. Take 
out the stones of the dates, and in place of each 
insert half a blanched almond. Then pack the 
dates in the basin (one at a time) as closely as 
possible — pressing them in tightly. When full, put 
a heavy weight on the dates — the size of the top of 



PASTRY AND SWEET DISHES 223 

the basin — and let it stand for twenty-four hours ; 
then turn out of the basin (by sUpping a thin 
knife round the sides of the basin) on to a plate 
(a green plate looks best), and when wanted, cut 
it in thin slices (as you would a round cake). 
To be eaten for breakfast, tea, or supper, with a 
knife and fork and bj'ead and butter — a perfect meal. 

561. DATES IN CUSTARD (Hampshire) 

Stone enough dates to cover the bottom of a glass 
dish, and put half a blanched almond in each ; pour 
over them one pint of custard and serve cold. 

662. DATE MOULD (Middlesex) 
Remove the stones from one pound of dates; 
chop up the fruit and put it into a lined pan, with 
the grated rind and the juice of a good-sized lemon. 
Just cover it with water, and set it to simmer. If 
the water simmers away, you must put a little more. 
Stir gently now and then, as it may stick and bum. 
When it becomes a thick paste, turn it into a wet 
mould, and when quite cold, turn it out and serve 
with custard or whipped cream. 

Prunes may be treated in the same way, using 
half a pint of water to one pound of prunes, but 
you will want seven or eight lumps of sugar to one 
pound of prunes, and half an ounce of gelatine, 
previously melted in half a pint of water and added 
to the rest. 

563. GREEN FIGS (Hertfordshire) 
Stew in a pint of compote syrup for three minutes 
a dozen small green figs, and serve with whipped 
cream. 



224 PASTRY AND SWEET DISHES 

664. FIG JELLY (Surrey) 

Take one pound of small cooking figs, remove the 
stems, and pour them over some very hot water, but 
it should not be boiling. Leave them for a minute 
or two, then drain off the water. Then cut each 
fig in pieces, and to each pound of figs put one 
pound of sugar, a little grated lemon-peel, and the 
juice of one lemon. Put them into a pan and let 
them cook very slowly, until the syrup thickens and 
the figs become clear : stir carefully, and if it gets 
too thick add a little water. When cold, pour off 
into jars and cover tightly. 

566. STEWED FIGS (Surrey) 

Pulled figs are the best for this. They should be 
cooked very slowly, in as little water as possible, 
with a very little sugar, to taste, and a thin lemon- 
rind, in the proportion of one lemon to the pound. 
They should not swell out so as to assume a bloated 
appearance, which shows that they have boiled 
instead of stewing. Test with a silver fork when 
they are soft enough, and add about two teaspoon- 
fuls of lemon-juice before taking them out of the 
stewpan. 

666. PEAR COMPOTE (Sussex) 

Pare and core your pears, slice them into quarters, 
put them in a lined pan to a little sugar, and just 
cover them with claret. Let them cook very gently 
till they are quite tender. No cochineal will be 
required. The amount of sugar depends upon the 
kind of pears. 



PASTRY AND SWEET DISHES 225 

667. TO STEW PEARS (Eighteenth Century) 

Pare the largest stewing pears, and stick a clove in 
tlie blossom end ; then put them in a weU-lined 
saucepan, fill it with hard water, and set it over a 
slow fire for three or four hours till the pears are 
soft, and the water reduced to a small quantity. 
Then put in as much loaf sugar as will make a thick 
syrup, and give the pears a boil ia it. Cut some 
lemon peel in straws and hang them about your 
pears, and serve them up with the syrup in a deep 
dish. 

668. TO STEW PIPPINS WHOLE (Eighteenth Century) 

Pare and core your pippins, and throw them into 
cold water as you pare them. Take the weight of 
the fruit in fine sugar, and dissolve it in a quart of 
water ; then boil it up, skim it clear, and put in the 
fruit. Let them steam gently till they are tender 
and look clear. Then take them out, and squeeze 
into the syrup the juice of a large lemon. Let it 
boil, skim it, and run it through a jeUy-bag upon 
the fruit. You may stick the pippins with strips of 
candied fruits if you please. 

569. RASPBERRY SPONGE (Essex) 
Take the whites of four eggs and beat them to a 
firm froth. Take about one pound of good fresh 
ripe raspberries, stalk them, mash them thoroughly, 
and sweeten them to taste with sifted sugar. Then 
gradually beat them into the whisked whites, a 
little at a time, so that the sponge keeps stiff. Pile 
it up in a glass dish.

571. FRENCH BANCES (Eighteenth Century) 

Take half a pint of water, a bit of lemon peel, a 
bit of butter the bigness of a walnut, a little orange- 
flower water ; let these boil three or four minutes ; 
then take out the lemon peel, and add to it a pint of 
flour; keep the water boiling and stirring all the 
while till it is stiff, then take it off the fire, and put 
in six eggs, leaving out the whites of three ; beat 
these well for about half an hour, tUl they come to 
a stiff paste. Drop small pieces of this into a pan 
of boiling lard, with a teaspoon ; if they are of a 
right lightness they will be very nice ; keep shaking 
the pan all the time till they are a light brown. A 
large dish will take six or seven minutes to cook ; 
when done enough, put them into a dish that will 
drain them, set them by the fire, and strew fine 
sugar over them. 

572. BENITA SHAPE (Devonshire) 

Two eggs, juice of two lemons, half a pound of 
castor sugar, grated rind of one lemon, five sheets 
of gelatine. Melt the gelatine in a tumbler of warm 
water ; slightly whip the yolks of the eggs and 



PASTEY AKD SWEET DISHES 227 

castor sugar gradually together, add the lemon rind 
and juice and gelatine whilst warm. When almost 
cold, stir in lightly the whites of eggs well whipped. 
Pour into a wet mould and put into a cool place to 
set. This can be made with oranges instead of 
lemons, and the rind can be left out if not liked. 

573. BROWN BREAD-CRUMB TRIFLE (Surrey) 

Put through a fine sieve any stale brown bread, 
till you have two breakfastcupfuls of fine crumbs, 
which pile on a dish. Put over about a breakfast- 
cupful of some moist juicy jam, such as strawberry, 
which will soak into the crumbs. When it has fairly 
soaked in, mask the whole iu whipped cream. This 
is exceedingly good if the crumbs are weU saturated. 

674. COLDHARBOUR BALLS (Surrey) 

Dissolve an ounce of butter in a quart of warm 
milk, and use as much fine flour as wiU make a stiff 
paste ; add, ia making the paste, about half a tea- 
spoonful of salt, and two eggs beaten up with a table- 
spoonful of yeast ; cover with a cloth and keep it 
before the fire for half an hour, then roll into balls or 
in pieces of the size and length of the little finger, 
and bake in a quick oven. 

576. APPLE FRITTERS (Cheshire) 

Take some large apples, peel, and slice them 
through in rounds a quarter to half an inch 
thick. Lay some sUces for two hours in a basin 
with brandy and powdered white sugar. Then 
make a stiff batter, and stir into it just before using 



228 PASTRY AND SWEET DISHES 

the whites of two eggs beaten to a stiff froth. Drain 
the apples, cover well with the batter, and fry in 
hot lard or butter. Drain on blotting paper before 
the fire. Pile high on a dish, and sprinkle with 
sifted sugar. 

576. COMMON FRITTERS (Eighteenth Century) 

Take haK a pint of ale and two eggs, beat in as 
much flour as will make it rather thicker than a 
common pudding, with nutmeg and sugar to your 
taste, let it stand three or four minutes to rise, then 
drop it in tablespoonfuls into a pan of boiling lard ; 
fry them a light brown, drain them on a sieve ; serve 
them up with sugar grated over them, and wine 
sauce in a boat. 

577. PLAIN FRITTERS WITH RICE 
(Eighteenth Century) 

Grate the crumb of a penny loaf, pour over it a 
pint of boiling cream, or good milk, let it stand four 
or five hours, then beat it exceedingly fine. Put to 
it the yolks of five eggs, four oimces of sugar, and 
a nutmeg grated, beat them well together, and fry 
them in hog's lard ; drain them on a sieve, and 
serve them up with wine sauce under them. N.B. 
You may put currants in if you please. 

578. WATER FRITTERS (Eighteenth Century) 

Take a quart of water, five or six tablespoonfuls 
of flour (the batter must be very thick) and a httle 
salt, mix all these together and beat the yolks and 
whites of eight eggs with a little brandy, then strain 



PASTRY AND SWEET DISHES 229 

them, through a hair sieve, and put them to the 
other things ; the longer they stand before you fry 
them the better. Just before you fry them, melt 
about haK a pound of butter very thick, and beat it 
well in ; you must not turn them, and take care 
not to bum them. The best thing to fry them in is 
fine lard. 

579. FRENCH PANCAKES (Cumberland) 

Two eggs, a gill of milk, the weight of the two 
eggs in butter, flour and castor sugar, jam. Beat 
the butter to a cream, then beat in the sugar and 
flour. Beat up the eggs with the mUk, add them 
to the other ingredients ; beat all very well. Butter 
some saucers, put in the mixture, and bake in a 
quick oven for twenty minutes. Warm some jam, 
put a little on each pancake, double them over, 
sprinkle with sugar and serve. 

580. FRENCH PANCAKES (Ireland) 

Beat two ounces of butter to a cream, add two 
beaten eggs, stir in two ounces of flour and two 
ounces of sifted sugar. When well mixed, add half

buttered plates. Bake twenty minutes and serve 
with jam. Very light and nice when well made 
with fresh eggs. 

581. MADRAS PANCAKES 

To six eggs, well beaten, add two tablespoonfuls of 
boiled rice, sugar to taste, a little pounded cinnamon, 
and a little orange-flower water ; mix all well to-

Boil a large beetroot tender, and beat it fine in 
a marble mortar, then add the yolks of four eggs, 
two spoonfuls of flour, and three spoonfuls of good 
cream ; sweeten it to your taste, grate in half a nut- 
meg, and put in a glass of brandy ; beat all to- 
gether half an hour. Fry the pancakes in butter, 
and garnish them with green sweetmeats, preserved 
apricots, or green sprigs of myrtle. It is a pretty 
corner dish for either dinner or supper. 



683. RUSSIAN PANCAKES (Hertfordshire) 

Make some very small thin pancakes, fill them 
with thick jam, or (if desired as a savoury) with 
queneUe forcemeat, fish, or fowl ; roll up the pan- 
cakes, trim them evenly, dip in egg and bread 
crumbs, and fry. Serve quickly.

685. AN EXCELLENT SWEET (Staffordshire) 

Take twelve yolks of eggs, a gill of sherry ; place 
them over a slow fire with sugar to your taste. 
Whisk the mixture until it becomes thick. Pour 
it into a glass dish, and when cold ornament with 
ratafia cakes, or anything else you may fancy. Half 
the quantity makes a nice small dish. 

586. TAPIOCA CREAM (Essex) 

Three ounces of tapioca, one pint of milk, half a 
pint of cream, sugar, lemon juice or sherry, essence 
of almond, four penny sponge cakes, one ounce of 
sweet almonds. Wash the tapioca and put it to

CHAPTER XV 

CREAMS, CUSTARDS, JUNKETS, 
SYLLABUBS, ETC. 

Note. — In the making of creams and custards, 
and of all those fluffy, frothy, delightful festival 
dishes which are much " too bright and good for 
human nature's daily food," our grandmothers 
undoubtedly excelled. 

The very recipes make one's mouth water, and 
although we cannot usually command the warm 
and foamy milk fresh from the cow, or the un- 
limited quarts of rich cream, in which they seem 
to have rejoiced — yet we can at any rate adapt to 
our narrower conditions some of the admirable 
concoctions here collected and presented. She is 
no good cook who cannot make the best of what she 
already has. The junkets and custards are in 
particular worthy of attention ; for all the multiplicity 
of custard powders, egg powders, pudding powders, 
of to-day, shall never equal the hand-made, home- 
made dehcacy. The " Everlasting Syllabub " on 
page 241 is a singularly admirable dish, 

CREAMS 

688. BURNT CREAM (Middlesex) 

Beat and mix well together the yolks of six eggs, 
two tablespoonfuls of flour, the peel of a lemon 

232

grated, and four or five bitter almonds ; sweeten 
with lump sugar, and stir over the fire till it comes 
to a good thickness, and pour it iato the dish in 
which it is to be served ; boil some pounded loaf 
sugar in water until it turns brown, and then pour 
it over the cream in fantastic figures. 

689. COFFEE CREAM (Middlesex) 

Having dissolved one ounce of isinglass, boil it 
with two quarts of cream, and mix it with one and 
a half pints of very strong coffee ; sweeten well, 
whisk it for ten minutes, put it into custard cups, 
and let them stand in a pan of boiling water till 
they become firm. 

590. COFFEE CREAM (Berkshire) 

One pint of milk and cream mixed, half a cup of 
strong coffee added, sweeten to taste. Dissolve one 
ounce of gelatine (previously soaked). Beat all 
together and turn into a wet mould. 

591. CREAM FOR FRUIT PIES (Middlesex) 

This is made by boiling new milk with grated nut- 
meg or cinnamon, two or three peach leaves, or a 
few bitter almonds, and a sufficient quantity of sugar 
to sweeten it ; then straining the cream and, when 
cold, beating up with it the yolks of eggs in the 
proportion of four to a quart, and warming the 
whole over the fire until it thickens. This is eaten 
cold with fruit tarts, or with any fresh fruits at 
dessert. If one-quarter of the quantity be rich 
cream, instead of the whole being milk, it will be 
improved. 



234 CREAMS, CUSTARDS, JUNKETS, ETC. 

592. TO MAKE DEVONSHIRE CREAM (Sussex) 

Place new milk in a clean jug or can, and stand 
it in a saucepan of warm water. Bring the water 
to the boil, and let it boil for half an hour. Then 
pour the milk into a shallow basin or dish, and let 
it stand until quite cold. The cream will be found 
quite thick and clotted, like Devonshire cream ; and 
if it is required still thicker, it can be whipped in 
the same manner as unscalded cream. 

693. FROTHED CREAM (Kent) 

Rub a lump of loaf sugar on the rind of a lemon ; 
put it iato a pint of cream, and sweeten it to your 
taste, then put in a glass of Madeira wine, or French 
brandy. Mill it to a froth in a chocolate mill ; 
take it ofl as it rises, and lay it on your dish. 

694. ITALIAN CREAM (Middlesex) 

Having sweetened a pint of cream, boil it with a 
lemon, cut very thin, and a small stick of cinnamon ; 
strain and mix with it a little dissolved isinglass : 
while hot, add to it the yolks of eight eggs well 
beaten, and stir it till quite cold. 

595. KING WILLIAM'S CREAM (Eighteenth Century) 

Beat the whites of three eggs very well. Squeeze 
out the juice of two large, or three small lemons : 
take two ounces more than the weight of the juices 
in sifted sugar, and mix it with two or three drops 
of orange-flower water, and five or six spoonfuls 
of cold water. Melt this in a pan, and when all 
the sugar is melted, put in the whites of eggs, and 



CREAMS, CUSTAEDS, JUNKETS, ETC. 235 

the juice. Set it over a slow fire, and keep stirring 
till you find it thicken : then strain it through a 
coarse cloth quick into a dish. 

696. LEMON CREAM (Ireland) 

Take a pint of thick cream, and put to it the yolk 
of two eggs well beaten, four ounces of white sugar, 
and the rind of a lemon. Boil it up ; stir it till 
almost cold. Put the juice of a lemon into a bowl, 
and pour the cream upon it, stirring it till cold. 

597. MiyDEIRA CREAMS (Hertfordshire) 

Cut some bananas and rub them through a coarse 
sieve ; add as much cream as you have fruit, and 
a pinch of salt. To every pint of this mixture add 
two ounces of sugar, and a dessertspoonful of brandy 
or liquor. Beat this very stiff and light, and, just 
before serving, place in custard glasses. 

598. LEMON CREAM (Middlesex) 

Required : two lemons, two eggs, two ounces of 
cornflour, six ounces of castor sugar, one pint of 
water. Pare the lemons thinly, and boil the rind 
well in the water for five minutes, mix the corn- 
flour with the strained juice of lemons, add the 
liquid from the rinds, return to the saucepan and 
boil for three minutes, stirring all the time. Add 
the sugar and cook slightly, mix in the yolks of 
eggs well-beaten, and stir over a gentle heat, until 
they thicken. Whip the whites into a stiff froth, 
and stir lightly into the mixture. Pour into a wet 
mould ; when cold, turn out. 



236 CREAMS, CUSTARDS, JUNKETS, ETC. 

699. RATAFIA CREAM (Hampshire) 

Take one lemon, half a pint of fresh cream, two 
penny sponge cakes, one wineglassful of sherry, fifteen 
lumps of sugar, a few ratafias. Peel the lemon very 
thinly, and allow the rind to soak some hours in the 
juice and wine, to which also add the sugar. Cut 
your sponge cakes in slices, and place them in a 
glass dish. Now whip the cream as stiff as possible, 
and put it on the cake. Decorate with the ratafias, 
and the dish is ready. This cream is very nice used 
without the sponge cakes, and served in custard 
glasses ; it is then called Everlasting Syllabub. 

600. SNOW CREAM (Kent) 

Put to a quart of cream the whites of three eggs 
beaten, four dessertspoonfuls of white wine, sugar 
to your taste, add a piece of lemon peel, and whip 
to a froth. Remove the peel, and serve in a dish, 

601. SPANISH CREAM (Seventeenth Century) 

Take three dessertspoonfuls of rice flour sifted 
very fine, the yolk of three eggs, three dessfert- 
spoonfuls of water and two of orange-flower water. 
Put to them one pint of cream. Set the mixture 
over a good fire and stir till it be of a proper 
thickness, then pour it into cups. 

602. SPANISH CREAM (Surrey) 

Boil two ounces of isinglass in a pint of water till 
quite dissolved, and mix with it two quarts of good 
milk ; stir it over the fire till it begins to boU, then 



CREAMS, CUSTARDS, JUNKETS, ETC. 237 

let it cool a little, and add gradually the yolks of 
twelve eggs well beaten, a large glass of white wine, 
and a little ratafia ; pour it into a dish, sweeten to 
taste, and when cold put it into shapes. 

603. STONE CREAM (Middlesex) 

This is made by boiling a quarter of an ounce of 
isinglass in a little water, and boihng it with a pint 
of sweetened cream, stirring it well ; pour this into a 
dish in which have been placed preserved fruit, such 
as apricots, cherries, etc., with some lemon juice (say 
two or three tablespoonfuls) and some grated lemon 
peel. 

604. STRAWBERRY CREAM (Middlesex) 

Boil some good cream with a sufficient quantity of 
sugar to sweeten it, and reduce it to one half its bulk : 
then add a little rennet, and the juice of strawberries, 
sufficient to give a good flavour ; and bake in a 
slow oven. 

605. SWISS CREAM (Surrey) 

Boil the grated peel of a good-sized lemon, and 
rather more than half a pound of white loaf sugar 
in a pint of cream, thickening with a spoonful of flour 
previously mixed up with a tablespoonful of lemon 
juice ; this is to be added very gradually as the 
cream warms, and the whole is to be carefully 
stirred ; when it is taken from the flre, stir tiU 
nearly cold, and serve in a glass dish garnished with 
preserved fruits, or candied orange and lemon peel. 
There is another dish called Swiss Cream which is 



238 CREAMS, CUSTARDS, JUNKETS, ETC. 

eaten hot ; it is made by whisking up in a basin or 
deep dish, previously made very hot, the yolks of 
eight eggs with half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, 
the grated rind of a lemon, and half a pint of white 
French wine. 



CUSTARDS 

606. CUSTARD (Kent) 

To one quart of good milk add the yolks of ten 
eggs. First boil the milk with some cinnamon and 
sugar ; when nearly cold add it to the eggs, and 
keep constantly stirring. Put it into a large jug, 
and put the jug into a pot of boiling water. Do 
not allow the custard to boil ; and before taking it 
out of the jug, add some bitter and some sweet 
almonds ; then put into glasses. 

607. BAKED CUSTARD (Berkshire) 

To one quart of new mUk allow four or five eggs, 
a quarter of a pound loaf sugar, one lemon peel 
grated, eight to ten bitter ahnonds pounded, or a 
few drops of essence of bitter almonds, and a table- 
spoonful of brandy. Bake in a slow oven, but don't 
allow it to boil, or the custard will " break " and 
curdle. 

608. CHEAP CUSTARD (Yorkshire) 

Boil one pint of milk, sweeten it with any spice 
you like. Rub smooth two tablepoonfuls of ground 
rice in a little cold milk, then put into it two yolks 
of eggs well beaten. Afterwards add the boiled 



CEEAMS, CUSTARDS, JUNKETS, ETC. 239 

milk, and stir them well together. Then stir it 
over a slow fire till it thickens, but it must not boil. 



609. CHOCOLATE CUSTARDS (Surrey) 

Take one and a half ounces of best chocolate, 
dissolve it gently by the side of the fire in rather 
over one wineglassful of water, then let it boil tUl 
quite smooth. Add one pint of new milk, (flavoured 
with lemon peel or vanilla) and two ounces of fine 
sugar, and let all come to the boil. Then stir it 
into five well-beaten and strained eggs. Put the 
custard into a jar and set this in a pan of boihng 
water ; stir continually Tmtil it thickens, and then 
take it off. When nearly cold, pour it into glasses. 
This is much richer when made with yolks only; 
but in that case you must use the following propor- 
tions : two ounces of chocolate, one pint of milk, 
half a pint of cream, two to three ounces of sugar, 
and eight yolks. 

610. COUNTESS CUSTARD (Sussex) 

Cut five sponge-cakes in half. Place on a dish 
with alternate layers of fruit, the last layer being 
fruit. Make a nice thick custard and flavour with 
orange-flower water, sweeten to taste, and when 
nearly cold, pour it over the fruit. 

611. WASSAIL CUSTARD (Hertfordshire) 

Line a dish with slices of stale sponge cakes, 
ratafia biscuits, and macaroons. Mix the juice of 
a lemon with a little raisin wine and pour it over 
the cakes. When these have quite absorbed the 



240 CREAMS, CUSTARDS, JUNKETS, ETC. 

liquor, pour a pint of good custard over, and decorate 
the top with angelica, chopped cherries, and a little 
chopped pistachio nut. 



JUNKETS 
612. JUNKET (Somerset) 

Take one quart of new milk. Warm some of it 
with five knobs of loaf sugar, then pour the hot and 
cold milk together into a deep bowl. Add one good 
tablespoonful of brandy and one of rennet. Stir 
it well round together. Let it stand in a warm place 
to set, say on a dish on a cool part of the stove. 
Then remove it, and cover the top with Devonshire 
clotted cream. Throw over it a tablespoonful of 
brandy, then grate a Httle nutmeg on it and scatter 
sifted sugar. Walnuts are a welcome addition. Send 
to table with plain biscuits or bread. 

613. JUNKET (Surrey) 

One quart of milk, lukewarm (not scalded or even 
hot) ; two tablespoonfuls of soft white sugar ; two 
tablespoonfuls of rum ; one dessertspoonful of 
essence of rennet. Put the milk to stand on the 
stove for five or ten minutes to get shghtly warm, 
then stir in the sugar and rum and mix them well, 
then add the rennet; stir it well, and then stir again 
in a few minutes. Leave the junket in a corner of 
the stove, not too hot, until it is solid, then grate a 
Uttle nutmeg over it and put it to cool. 

(N.B. Sherry may be advantageously substituted 
for the rum.) 



CREAMS, CUSTARDS, JUNKETS, ETC. 241 

614. COFFEE JUNKET (Surrey) 

To one pint of new milk add half a teacupful of 
strong coffee, and one dessertspoonful of castor sugar. 
Make this as you would ordinary junket, using one 
teaspoonful of essence of rennet or one rennet tablet. 
Pour into the bowl it wUl be served in, and let it 
stand in a moderately cool place tiU set. Whip 
two-pennyworth of cream, add a httle sugar, and 
arrange little dobs of cream on the top of the junket, 
just before it is sent to table. 

SYLLABUBS 

615. SYLLABUB (Kent, 1809) 

The whites of four eggs beaten to a froth ; add half 
a pound of fine sugar, a little at a time, beating till 
the sugar is melted. Put in the juice of a good 
lemon and half a pint of sweet white wine. Keep 
beating it with a whisk that, it may be well mixed. 
Put to it a pint of very sweet thick cream, beat it 
well together. Then fill your glasses. They should 
stand six or seven hours. 

616. SYLLABUB (Surrey) 

Half a pint of scalded cream, half a pint of raw 
cream, one dessertspoonful of white sifted sugar, 
two wineglassfuls of sherry, two tablepoonfuls of 
brandy, a little grated nutmeg, the juice of one and 
a half lemons. Whip it to a froth and fill the glasses. 

617. EVERLASTING SYLLABUB (Isle of Wight) 

Steep the peel and juice of one lemon overnight in 
a wineglassful of white wine. Next morning, pour 
16 



242 CREAMS, CUSTARDS, JUNKETS, ETC. 

this into a deep pan, and stir in gradually half a pint 
of thick cream, with sugar to taste : whip for a 
quarter of an hour, and put into glasses. This is 
better made the day before using, and wiU keep for 
several days. 



618. SYLLABUB WITH CAKES (Middlesex) 

Steep sponge biscuits, or any other cakes, in equal 
quantities of port, claret, and brandy ; mash them 
up with a spoon, and add grated nutmeg, and lemon 
peel, lemon juice, sweet almonds, blanched and 
pounded to paste, and sufficient sugar to make the 
whole sweet ; the quantity of the above will depend 
on the size of the syllabub required. Put all these 
ingredients into a bowl, and let the milk of a cow. 
be milked upon them, adding a little good cream 
and sifted loaf sugar. A very good syllabub may 
be made by mixing half a pint of sherry, half a pint 
of Burgundy, a wineglass of any ratafia, half a pound 
of pounded white sugar, some grated nutmeg, the 
grated peel of a lemon, and the juice of a lemon ; 
when these have been well stirred together, and the 
sugar is dissolved, add one quart of rich cream, 
and whisk it up until it froths well ; put some maca- 
roons, or sponge biscuits, into a dish, and pile the 
froth upon them ; or the syUabub may be served in 
glasses. If the whites of six eggs be whipped up 
with the syllabub, it may be served up difierently, 
but the whipping must be continued for a long time ; 
as the froth rises, put it on a sieve to dry, and having 
half filled wineglasses with wine, fill them up with 
the froth. The common syllabub is generally served 
without cream or whipping ; wine, nutmeg, sugar, 



CREAMS, CUSTARDS, JUNKETS, ETC. 243 

grated lemon peel, with or without a httle brandy 
or Uqueur, are mixed in a basin, and the milk of the 
cow is milked upon them. The quantity of milk is 
generally in the proportion of three pints to one 
pint of wine ; but this may be reduced, or iacreased, 
according to taste. 

619. WHIPPED SYLLABUB (Yorkshire, 1769) 

Take two porringers of cream and one of white 
wine, grate in the rind of a lemon. Take the whites 
of three eggs, sweeten to your taste, then whip it 
with a whisk. Take off the froth as it rises, and put 
it into your syllabub glasses. 

620. LEMON POSSET (Yorkshire, 1769) 

Take one pint of good thick cream, grate into it 
the outer rind of two lemons, and squeeze the juice 
into half a gill of white wine, and sweeten it to your 
taste. Take the whites of two eggs and beat them 
to a froth, then beat all together in a bowl, then put 
it into the glasses for use. 

TRIFLES 
621. TRIFLE (Isle of Wight) 

Take three penny sponge cakes, three tablespoon- 
fuls of raspberry or apricot jam, two eggs with whites 
and yolks separated, a quarter of a pint of mUk, 
one tablespoonful of castor sugar, three drops ratafia 
essence. Cut the sponge cakes into slices and 
spread with the jam ; lay them in a glass dish. 
Make a custard of the yolk, milk, and essence, and 
half the sugar. Pour it over the sponge cakes and 



244 CREAMS, CUSTARDS, JUNKETS, ETC. 

allow them to soak for a quarter of an hour. Mix 
the rest of the sugar with the whites, which must 
be whipped to a stiff froth and then piled lightly on 
the top. Cost Id. 

622. TRIFLE (Kent) 

Cover the bottom of a dish with Naples biscuits, 
macaroons, and ratafia cakes. Wet them with 
sweet wine ; put over them a thick custard, then a 
small quantity of raspberry jam, and cover the whole 
with a frothed cream. 

623. TRIFLE (Middlesex) 

To prepare this, take two ounces of blanched sweet 
almonds, and one ounce of blanched bitter almonds, 
and pound them to a smooth paste, adding as you 
pound them, a httle rose-water ; take two lemons, 
and grate the peels, and squeeze the juice into a 
saucer ; four small sponge cakes, or Naples biscuits, 
and eight, or more, macaroons must next be broken 
into small pieces, and mixed with the almonds, 
and the mixture be laid at the bottom of a glass 
bowl ; grate a nutmeg over this, and throw in the 
peel and the juice of the lemons ; to the whole add 
half a pint of white wine mixed with half a gill of 
brandy, and let the mixture remain until the cakes 
are dissolved, when it may be stirred a httle. To a 
quart of cream, add a quarter of a pound of powdered 
loaf sugar, and a glass of noyeau, and beat with a 
whisk till it stands alone ; as the froth rises, take it 
off with a spoon, and lay on a sieve, with a large dish 
under it, to drain ; then take the cream that has 
been drained into the dish, and pour it back into 



CREAMS, CUSTARDS, JUNKETS, ETC. 245 

the pan with the rest, the whole being beaten over 
again ; this being done, set the cream in a cool place. 
Have now a pint of rich baked custard, made of the 
yolks of eggs, cold, and pour into the bowl upon the 
dissolved cakes, and when the cream is cold, pour 
that in also, heaping it high in the centre ; a layer 
of fruit, jelly, or of well-preserved fruit, may be 
put in between the custard and the frothed cream, 
if that be preferred. 

624. TINNED APRICOTS AND TRIFLE (Surrey) 

Warm the syrup, add sugar if necessary, then 
put in the apricots and cook a few minutes. Cut 
stale sponge cakes into slices, place in glass dish ; 
pour a little warm apricot syrup over them, leave 
quite an hour. Put apricots (or peaches, or pears, 
half a tin) on the sponge cakes, then a custard. 
Finish the top with whipped cream, sweetened and 
flavoured (a whipped white of egg may be added to 
make more of it), decorate with pistachio nuts, 
cherries, or angelica. For one pint of custard it will 
be necessary to take half a pint of milk, one egg (a 
yolk of another egg may be added), one ounce of 
loaf sugar, and one teaspoonful of cornflour. 



CHAPTER XVI 

JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, FRUIT 
PASTES, ETC. 

Note. — The great pre-eminence of the home jam 
over the factory article, is that, in the words of 
Sam Weller, one " knows the lady wot made it." 
One also is assured that she did not put in carrots, 
seeds, glucose, or any alien matter in the way of 
coloratives, preservatives, or sweeteners unknown 
to the " home-farm." Of home-made jam one may 
partake freely with pleasant and beneficial results ; 
shop jam frequently leaves an acid taste in the mouth 
and a most undesirable effect upon the whole of 
the mucous membrane. Jams and preserves, more- 
over, can be so easily achieved, and in most cases 
so cheaply, that one is hardly justified in denying 
one's family these inexpensive and invaluable com- 
modities. It is especially advisable to attempt 
those concoctions which cannot, as a rule, be 
bought— apple jam, for instance, and rhubarb, and 
vegetable marrow — grape-jelly (a charming affair), 
— preparations of quince, mulberry, cucumber, etc. 
Not so many recipes as you might expect are to 
be found in the ensuing selection ; the reason being, 
I imagine, that people were so accustomed to jam- 
maliing as a matter of ordinary annual occurrence, 

246 



JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 247 

they never thought of writing down any formulas 
for what everybody knew quite well. Be that as 
it may, the everyday jams are to be found in any 
cookery-book ; you can hardly go wrong in them. 
Those here presented are of a somewhat more 
unwonted character. 



JAMS, JELLIES, MARMALADES 

625. APPLE GINGER (Yorkshire) 

Four pounds of apples, four pounds of sugar, one 
quart of water, two ounces of essence of ginger. 
Pare the fruit, take out the core, and cut in shapes 
as like ginger-root as possible. Boil the sugar and 
water for twenty-five minutes, till it is a nice syrup, 
then put in the apples, the syrup boiling quickly all 
the time, stirring it as little as possible; add the 
ginger ; it will take about an hour to clear and 
become yellow. Skim it well. Be sure to have your 
apples all one kind, either all green or all yellow ones. 



626. APPLE JAM (Cheshire) 

Four pounds of apples peeled and cut as for a pie ; 
an equal quantity of lump sugar ; the rind and juice 
of two lemons, or rather more, and rather better than 
three-quarters of an ounce of beaten grotmd ginger ; 
also a few cloves. Boil slowly for an hour and a 
half, or nearer two hours, without adding water. 
About five minutes before taking off the fire add a 
large wineglassful of spirits. This is to ensure the 
keeping well. 



248 JAMS, JELLIES, PRESEEVES, ETC. 

627. APPLE JELLY (Essex) 

To every three pounds of apples add about a quart 
of cold water. Simmer gently till tender and just on 
the point of mashing. Strain, without squeezing, 
through a jelly bag or hair sieve. Measure the 
juice which comes through, and boil it for fifteen 
minutes alone, then add a pound of preserving 
sugar to every pint, and boU sugar and juice together 
for twenty-five minutes. (The sugar should be 
made hot in the oven before using.) Pour into jars 
or jelly glasses, and cover over when cold, 

628. APPLE JELLY (Ireland) 
(For dessert use, not for keeping) 

Take the amount you wish of codlings, or other 
good English cooking apples ; pare, core, and cut 
them into thin slices into a deep earthenware pan, 
with as much water as will just cover them. When 
soft, strain them through a jeUy-bag. To every 
pound of liquor, add one pound of crushed or (better) 
powdered sugar. Boil it very fsist for ten minutes. 
Put some thinly sliced lemon peel in your moulds, 
and pour in the jelly. Do not boil much at a time. 

629. APPLE JELLY (Kent) 

Three pounds of white sugar, four pounds of 
apples (peeled and cored), a teaspoonful of cayenne 
pepper, two lemons, rind and juice. 

630. APPLE JELLY (Lancashire) 

Pare, core, and quarter the fruit, and weigh it 
quickly that it may not lose its colour. To each 



JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 249 

pound pour a pint of cold water, and boil it until it is 
well broken without being reduced to a white thick 
pulp, as it would then be difficult to render the juice 
perfectly clear, which it ought to be. Drain the 
juice well from the apples, either through a fine sieve, 
or a folded muslin strainer, and pass it afterwards 
through a jelly-bag, or turn the fruit at once into the 
last of these, and pour the liquid through a second 
time if needed. When it appears quite transparent, 
weigh, and reduce it by quick boiling for twenty 
minutes. Add two pounds of sugar for three of 
juice, then boil it for ten minutes. Put in the strained 
juice of a small lemon for every two pounds of jelly, 
a couple of minutes before it is taken from the fire. 

631. APPLE MARMALADE (Middlesex) 

Take six pounds of good cooking apples, peel and 
core them and cut them into small pieces, as for a 
pie, as evenly as possible. Put them into a basin 
of cold water that they may keep their colour white, 
while you do the rest. When ready, take them out 
and weigh them, put them into a deep bowl, and 
lay over them an equal amount of sugar, and to 
every three pounds of apples add one tablespoonful 
of ground ginger (this is better freshly grated, not 
in the bought powder). Leave all to stand for three 
days. The cores and peels should now be put in a lined 
preserving pan, with enough water to cover them, 
and boiled for half an hour, then strained off. At the 
end of the three days, strain off the syrup from the 
apples, add the juice from the peels, and boU for ten 
minutes. Then put in the slices of apple, and let 
them boil for half or three-quarters of an hour, 



250 JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 

till they are quite clear, taking care that they do 
not break. 

632. APPLE MARMALADE (Surrey) 

Take two pounds of good sound cooking apples, 
and put them in a lined saucepan with one pound of 
castor sugar and one pint of sweet cider. Let them 
cook quietly for three hours or so, until the fruit 
is so soft it can be put through a sieve. If it is not 
sweet enough, more castor sugar can be now added. 
Put it into jars or pots, like ordinary jam. 

633. BARBERRY JAM (1816) 

Pick your barberries from the stalks, and put them 
into an earthen pan, then into the oven to bake ; 
when baked, pass them through a sieve with a large 
wooden spoon, taking care there are no skins of the 
barberries left in ; weigh the barberries and to every 
two pounds allow two poimds and a half of powdered 
sugar ; mix the sugar and the fruit together, put 
it in your pots and cover it up ; set it in a dry 
place ; when you have filled your pots with it, sift a 
little powdered sugar over the tops of them. 

634. BLACKBERRY JAM (Yorkshire) 
Half a pound of good brown sugar to every pound 
of fruit ; boil the whole together gently for one hour, 
or till the blackberries are soft, stirring and mashing 
them well. 

635. CELERY IN IMITATION OF PRESERVED 
GINGER (Middlesex) 

Cut the blanched part of the celery in pieces, and 
boU it in water with a large quantity of ginger until 



JAMS, JELLIES, PEESERVES, ETC. 251 

it is quite tender, then throw it into cold water and 
allow it to remain an hour. At the end of this time 
put it over a slow fire in good syrup, with some pieces 
of ginger, and let it remain simmering for an hour. 
Cool it again, and in the meantime, thicken the 
syrup by further evaporation. Put the celery in 
again, and repeat the same process. After a third 
simmering in this way, taking care to keep the 
syrup thick, put the celery into pots, and cover 
with syrup. The stalks of lettuce, taking off the 
outside, prepared in the same way, make a very 
nice dessert sweet. 

636. TO DRY CHERRIES WITHOUT SUGAR 

(Seventeenth Century) 

Stone the cherries and set them in a pan over 
the fire, with only what liquor comes out of them. 
Shake them as they boil, then put them in an earthen 
pot. The next day scald them, and when they are 
cold, lay them on sieves to dry in an oven not too 
hot. Twice heating in an oven will dry any sort of 
cherries. 

637. PRESERVED CITRONS (Kent) 

Put them into water overnight ; boil them till 
quite tender, cut them in halves, and to every pound 
of citrons add a pound of sugar. Put about a table- 
spoonful of water to every pound of sugar ; when all 
is dissolved, pour it on the citrons, then put all on 
the fire and let them boil about half an hour. Soak 
a few races of ginger in water three or four days — 
boil them first with a thin syrup, and afterwards 
with the citrons. 



252 JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 

638. TO PRESERVE SIBERIAN CRABS (Cheshire) 

A pound of loaf sugar to half a pint of water. 
Simmer till clear. Then boil the crabs in this, very 
gently tiU done, having first pricked them all over 
to keep them from bursting. A little ginger, lemon, 
and cochineal to be added before boiling. The 
stalks are to be left on. 

639. CRAB-APPLE JELLY (Kent) 

Cut the crab-apples in halves, and put them in 
a preserving pan with enough water to cover them. 
Let them come to the boil but not to a pulp ; then 
strain, and to every pint of juice add three-quarters 
of a pound of white sugar. Boil three-quarters of 
an hour. 

640. PRESERVED CRANBERRIES (Middlesex) 

For every pound of the fruit use two pounds of 
sugar : pour a little water into the preserving pan, 
then a layer of sugar, and then a layer of fruit : 
boil gently for twenty minutes, and skim. 

641. PRESERVED CUCUMBER (Ireland) 

Take large and small cucumbers free from seeds ; 
put them into salt and water, with cabbage leaves 
on the top to keep them down. Tie a paper over, 
and put them in a warm place till they are yeUow ; 
then wash them out and put them into fresh salt 
water. Continue to change the water till they are a 
good green ; then take them out, and cut out aU 
the pulp, and put them into cold water to take out 
the salt. Let them so remain two or three days, 



JAMS, JELLIES, PEESERVES, ETC. 253 

changing the water twice a day. Take one pound 
of fine sugar, and half a pint of water, put on the fire 
and skim it clear. Add the rind of a lemon, cut very 
thin, and one ounce of ginger. When the syrup is 
cold, wipe the cucumbers, and put them in. Boil 
up the preserve three times a week for three weeks. 

642. QUIDDANY OF RED CURRANTS 
(Yorkshire, 1769) 

Put your red currant berries into a jar, with a 
spoonful or two of water, and cover it close, and 
stand it in boiling water. When you think they are 
done enough, strain them, and put to every pint 
of juice a pound of loaf sugar. Boil it up jelly 
height, and put it into glasses for use. 

643. DAMSONS FOR WINTER USE (Kent) 

To every pound of fruit allow half a pound of pre- 
serving sugar ; fruit to be sound and not too ripe. 
Put the fruit into large jars ; sprinkle the sugar 
over the fruit. Lay saucers over the jars and place 
them in a moderately cool oven for an hom: or two, 
until the fruit is tender. When cold, cover the top 
of the jars with white paper cut to the size of the 
jar. Pour over this melted mutton fat, about two 
inches thick ; cover over with brown paper, and 
keep in dry place. As a rule they keep till February ; 
but the fruit must not be too ripe. 

644. GOOSEBERRY JELLY (Lincolnshire) 

Make gooseberry jelly the ordinary way, and when 
it is ready to take off the fire, have ready a bunch 
of elder-flowers tied up in a piece of muslin, which

turn round and round in the jelly imtil it has the 
desired flavour ; it is really Uke a most dehcious 
grape. 

645. GRAPE CONSERVE (American) 

One basket of grapes, one and a half pints of sugar, 
one and a half pounds of seeded raisins, half a pound 
of walnut kernels. Remove pulp from grapes, boil 
five minutes, put through a colander, to remove 
seeds. Add raisins, sugar, and nuts chopped fine, 
and boil thirty minutes till thick. 

646. GRAPE JELLY (American) 

Free the grapes from stems and leaves. Put in 
preserving kettle, mash, and heat slowly. After 
reaching boiKng-point, simmer for half an hour. 
Put them in a jelly-bag — I let mine drip aU night. 
Measure juice, put in kettle, boil for twenty minutes. 
Measure equal quantity of sugar, add to juice, and 
stir till dissolved. Put into jelly glasses. 

647. GRAPE MARMALADE (American) 

Pulp the grapes ; cook pulps till tender. Press 
through sieve and add skins, allowing three-quarters 
of a pound of sugar to half a pound of fruit. Cook _ 
slowly. 

648. LEMON MARMALADE (Surrey) 

For this you want twelve lemons, and an equal 
weight in preserving sugar. Wash and wipe the 
lemons, then halve them, strain out the juice, and 
put the pips by themselves into a bowl with a 



JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 255 

tumblerful of cold water. The peels must be put 
into cold water in a lined pan, and boiled till tho- 
roughly tender. Then take them out, and having 
removed all the white pith you can, cut the rinds 
into the thinnest possible shreds or strips, about 
half an iach long. Next put the lemon juice, the 
water from the pips, and the sugar into a preserving 
pan, and let it boil to a syrup. Add the rinds, and 
boil till the marmalade will " set." 

649. MOUNTAIN ASH JELLY (Surrey) 
Pick the mountain-ash berries clean from the 
stalks, and stew them down to as near a pulp as 
you can, with enough water to cover them and a 
very little " race " ginger. Crush and strain the 
pulp, and boil it up again for half an hour, with 
two-thirds of its weight in sugar. (Mountain ash 
is known in Ireland as " quicken " and in Scotland 
as " rowan." It is credited with wonderfully re- 
storative properties, and is, I believe, largely used 
in the jeUy form upon the Continent, especially in 
Switzerland. Ed.) 

650. ANOTHER WAY (Middlesex) 

Pare, core, and slice two pounds of good preserving 
apples of the juiciest kind, and boil them for twenty 
minutes or more in one quart of water, till they are 
well to pieces. Strain off the water, and add to the 
apples in the preserving pan three pounds of moun- 
tain ash berries. Let all simmer gently tmtil quite 
pulped : then strain off the juice, and to every pint 
measure one pound of sugar. Let the juice boil fast 
for twenty minutes, then put in the sugar, which 



256 JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 

should be warmed and crushed. Boil for fifteen 
minutes more, skimming well, and then pour off the 
jelly into heated pots. Some people put a leaf of 
scented geranium, such as oakleaf, into every pot, 

651. PRESERVED MELONS OR CUCUMBERS (Kent) 

Gather the melons when fresh and green ; rub 
them smooth with a coarse cloth ; put them in strong 
salt and water ; tie them down close and set them 
by the fire ; change them from top to bottom till 
quite yellow, then put them in a skillet with layers 
of vine leaves and strong salt and water, a small 
piece of soda and the same of alum. Put it over the 
fire at some distance till quite scalding hot, but not 
boiling. If not green in a few hours, change the 
water and leaves, and put them on again ; when 
green, drain them on a sieve, and throw them in 
fresh water for three days, changing it every day. 
Make a thin syrup with one pound of sugar and a 
gallon of water boiled an hour and cleared with the 
white of an egg. When nearly cold, pour it over 
them, repeating the same for a week, each day a 
little warmer ; the last day let them boil five minutes. 

652. TO PRESERVE MULBERRIES IN SUGAR 
(Middlesex) 

Choose large and very ripe mulberries ; put them 
gently into some strong syrup, and let them boil, 
covering over the pan, and shaking it gently from 
time to time ; then take off the fire, skim the syrup, 
and let them stand for two hours. They are then 
to be put on again, and boiled until the syrup is 
exceedingly thick. Pour into glasses and pots, and 
keep by for use. 



JAMS, JELLIES, PEESERVES, ETC. 257 

653. TO PRESERVE MULBERRIES IN A DRY 
STATE (Middlesex) 

Gather them when not quite ripe, and give them 
a boil in syrup ; then let them stand for twenty-four 
hours near the fire, so as just to keep warm. At 
the end of this time, take them out, drain them, and 
put them upon tins, powdering them well with dry 
sugar, and exposing them to the sun. When they 
are dry on one side, turn them, powder them in the 
same way, and finish the drying. 

654. ORANGE JELLY (Kent) 

One ounce of isinglass, one pint of hot water. 
Rub some loaf sugar on the rinds of six oranges and 
four lemons until they appear white. Put the sugar 
into the water, and let it remain until the isinglass 
is dissolved, then add the juice of the fruit and let 
it just boil, then strain into moulds. 

655. ORANGE MARMALADE CONSERVE 
(Devonshire) 

Take three Seville oranges, one sweet orange, one 
lemon, five pounds of sugar, five pints of water. Cut 
fruit in half, squeeze all the juice out, put straight in 
preserving pan. Cut up the peel as finely as possible 
with very sharp knives, put into the pan also and 
five pints of water. Leave to soak for twenty-four 
hours. Put the pips to soak in a little water separ- 
ately ; boil them for some time and strain off into the 
other pan. Boil all for one hour without sugar, 
and then, without letting it cool, for two hours with 
sugar. When the juice begins to jellify on a cold 
saucer, it is done.

656. SMOOTH ORANGE MARMALADE (Kent, 1809) 

Weigh the oranges, take the same weight of sugar 
as of fruit, wipe all the oranges with a wet cloth 
and grate the rind, cut the fruit in quarters longways, 
strip off the skin with a knife and pick out the seeds 
clean from them, then put on the skins to boil until 
they are so tender that they will beat to a mash. 
When you take the skins ofE the fire, squeeze the 
water out of them, and take away all the strings. 
Pound them in a marble mortar, clarify the sugar, 
then take the pounded skins and mix them by 
degrees with the syrup. When it is well mixed 
put it into the pan and let it boil until the sugar is 
incorporated with it, then put in the pulp, which 
must be carefuUy scraped with a knife off the skins 
before they are put on to boil. Let the marmalade 
boil till it is of an equal thickness, you will know 
when it is done enough by its turning heavier in 
stirring, and of a finer colour. Whenever it begkis 
to spajkle it is done enough. Pound the grated 
rind in a mortar, take off the marmalade and stir 
in the grated rind carefully ; when it is all in, put 
on the pan again, and let it boil imtil it is 
thoroughly mixed. You may keep out some of the 
rind, unless you like it very bitter and thick. If 
you keep it out, use it for seasoning. In making 
Chip Marmalade only a small part of the skins are 
to be pounded, the remainder cut in strips. 

657. TO PRESERVE PEARS (Devonshire) 

Take the largest stewing pears when they are on 
the turn. Pare them nicely, cut them in halves, 
leaving the stem on. To every pound of pears add 



JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 259 

three-quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, and to 
about fifty pears put a pint of water, the juice and 
peel of four lemons (the peel to be pared thin and 
cut in long strips), a small cup of cloves, and a little 
cochineal to colour them. Let them stew very 
gently over a slow fire, turning them constantly 
until you can pass a straw through them, then add 
a teacupful of brandy and let them boU two or thiee 
minutes longer. Put them in jars and tie down 
as other preserves ; they will keep good for twelve 
months. 

658. PEAR MARMALADE (Yorkshire) 

You require six pounds of small pears, and four 
pounds of sugar. Put the pears into a saucepan 
with cold water ; cover it and set it over the fire tUl 
the fruit is soft ; then put the pears into cold water ; 
pare, quarter and core them, put to them three tea- 
cups of water, set them over the fire. Roll the sugar 
fine, mash the fruit fine and smooth, put the sugar 
to it, stir it well together till it is thick, like jelly. 
Then put it into tumblers or jars, and when it is 
quite cold serve it in the same way as jelly. 

659. TO PRESERVE JARGONEL PEARS (Ireland) 

Pare very thin, and simmer for ten minutes in a 
syrup of one pint of water and one pound of sugar. 
Let them lie a day or two. Make the syrup richer, 
and simmer again. Repeat this till they are clear, 
and the syrup the thickness of honey. 

660. PRESERVED PEACHES (Kent) 

Take an equal weight of fruit and sugar ; lay the 
fruit in a large dish, and sprinkle half the sugar over. 



260 JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 

in fine powder ; give them a gentle shaking ; the 
next day make a thin syrup with the remainder of 
the sugar, and instead of water, if you have it, 
allow one pint of red currant juice to every pound 
of peaches ; simmer them ia this till sufficiently 
clear. 
N.B. — Pick them when not dead ripe. 

661. QUINCE JAM (Kent) 

Half a pound of sugar to one pound of fruit ; 
about a large teacupful of water to five or six pounds 
of fruit. Cover the stewpan close during the last 
ten miuutes to improve the colour. The hard, dry 
quinces are better if peeled and put into a jar with 
a small quantity of sugar ; the peelings can be put 
on the top and covered with paper and put iuto the 
oven after the bread is out, and then preserved in 
the usual way. 

662. QUINCE MARMALADE (Kent) 

Peel the quinces and cut them into quarters, and 
to every pound of fruit allow three-quarters of a 
pound of loaf sugar with a little water. Boil them 
gently for three hours and put it into jars ; simmer 
the seeds in water to a jelly, and add to the above 
while boiling. 

663. UNBOILED RASPBERRY JAM (Gloucestershire) 

One and a quarter pounds of best lump sugar to 
each pound of raspberries. Put on the fruit, bring 
it to boihng point, but do not let it boil more than 
two or three nlinutes. Add the sugar — stir till 



JAMS, JELLIES, PEESERVES, ETC. 261 

quite dissolved. Again bring to boiling point. 
Dish it at once into warm jam pots and cover while 
hot. Keeps well. Is of splendid colour and retains 
the flavour of fresh fruit. 



664 RHUBARB JAM (Essex) 

Required : eight pounds of rhubarb, eight pounds 
of sugar, four level teaspoonfuls of ginger, one pound 
of candied peel. Wipe the rhubarb and cut into pieces 
about one inch long. Put in a pan, slightly crush 
the sugar and spread this over it. Leave it till next 
day. Then cut the lemon peel up thinly, add the 
ginger, and boil the whole till it turns a nice red 
colour, probably one and a half hours. Pour into 
dry scalded jars and cover down at once. It wiU 
not need any brandied paper. The easiest way to 
cover jam is to cut pieces of tissue paper to the desired 
size, dip in cold milk, and use, pressing carefully 
against the jar so that the covering shall be all tight. 
Unless carefully done, the paper wiU tear. 

665. PRESERVED RHUBARB (Lincolnshire) 

Weight for weight of fruit and sugar. Pare the 
rhubarb and cut in three-inch pieces ; pound one 
third of sugar, and put it over rhubarb. Let it 
stand all night. Pour off the juice in the morning, 
and boil it with the remainder of sugar. Then pour 
it over the fruit and let it stand tUI cold. Then put 
it through a hair sieve, and boil the juice again for 
fifteen minutes. Add the fruit and let it boil till 
tender. Some essence of ginger to be put in a little 
before it is taken off the fire. 



262 JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 

666. CONSERVE OF RED ROSES 
(Seventeenth Century) 

Take a quart of red rose-water, and a quart of 
fair (fresh) water, and boil in it a pound of red rose- 
leaves, the whites cut off. The leaves must be boiled 
very tender ; then take three pounds of sugar, 
and put it to the roses, a pound at a time, and let 
it boil a little between every pound : and so put it up 
in your pots. 

667. ROSE-PETAL JAM (Stirrey) 

Make a syrup of one pound of loaf sugar and as 
little rose-water as you can do with. Take a pound 
of rose-petals (cabbage roses are best) and dry them 
in a shady place. Scald them for a moment in 
boiling water, then drain and dry them, and add 
them, with a spoonful of orange-flower water, to 
the syrup. Boil in a preserving-pan until the jam 
will " set " or " jell " when dropped upon a plate. 
When it has cooled off a little, pour it into pots, and 
cover up well, the usual way. 

668. COMPETE OP WILD ROSE-BERRIES (Surrey) 

Collect wild rose-berries, cut off the tops, cut them 
open and carefully remove all seeds and hairs (it 
is well to wear gloves while doing this, as the hairs get 
under the nails and are curiously irritating). Then 
boil down the berries in a preserving-pan, with as 
little water as possible ; and when they are quite 
tender, pulp them through a sieve. Add sugar, the 
proportion being at least three-quarters of a pound 
to each pound of pulped berries, and let the mixture 



JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 263 

boil up quickly till the sugar is dissolved, then re- 
move it from the fire and bottle it as soon as ooolish. 
(This coiopote, under the name of Hagenmarken, 
is largely made and sold in Germany. The difference 
between a compote and a jam is stated variously by 
various authors ; but I take it that the latter term 
apphes to " wet " fruits, such as strawberries, rasp- 
berries, etc., and that the sugar is put in along 
with the fruit to boil. In a compote, the material, 
being harder and drier, needs long preliminary 
cooking ; the sugar really requires none at all, so 
can be added at the last moment ; it is not essential 
that it should be either syrupped or candied. Ed.) 

669. PRESERVED STEWED FRUIT (Somerset) 

Take equal weight of fruit and sugar, put the 
sugar in the oven and let it get so hot that it will 
burn the hand, but be careful it does not brown. 
Bring the fruit to boiling point and allow it to boil for 
five minutes ; add the melted sugar and let it boU 
for three minutes : it is then done. Raspberries 
done in this way will be a bright red colour, and 
taste like ripe fruit ; they wUl keep as well as a 
preserve done thus. 

670. TO SUGAR ANY SORT OP SMALL FRUIT 

(Seventeenth Century) 

Beat the white of an egg, and dip the fruit in it ; 
let it lie on a dry cloth : take some fine sifted sugar 
and gently roU the fruit in it till it is quite covered 
and coated with sugar. Lay it in a sieve on the 
stove, or before a fire, to dry it weU : it will keep 
well for a week. 



264 JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 

671. PRESERVED TOMATOES (Essex) 

Put the tomatoes in wide-mouthed open jars, 
cover them entirely with cold water, on the top of 
which pour half an inch of salad oil. Cover them 
closely and securely. (The correct placing of this 
recipe, as regards chapter, is hardly possible ! Ed.) 

672. VEGETABLE MARROW JAM (Middlesex) 

Procure a good sound well-ripened marrow, of 
twelve pounds weight. Peel it and cut it into 
cubes two inches square, add the juice and very 
thinly cut rind of four lemons ; mix in one pound of 
sugar to every pound of marrow, and place in an 
enamelled preserving-pan or in a deep earthenware 
jar, for twenty-four hours. Then add three ounces 
of bruised race ginger, and a quarter of an ounce of 
chillies (this is optional) in a muslin bag. Let the 
mixture boU for one and a half hours in the pre- 
serving-pan (counting from the time that it comes 
to the boU) and, just before it is done, add half a 
pound of candied peel cut into very thin strips. 

673. PRESERVED VEGETABLE MARROW (belaud) 

Cut the marrow in long narrow strips ; peel and 
weigh equal quantities of loaf sugar ; sprinkle a httle 
sugar on the fruit, and leave it for a night. Next 
day, boil it with its own syrup, and the rest of the 
sugar, and one lemon to every pound of fruit. Put 
about thirty pepper pods to every four pounds ; 
two wine-glasses of spirits to be added before taking 
it off the fire. Before adding the spirits, it is well 
to take out the fruit and boil the syrup with some 



JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 265 

more sugar, then pour over the fruit. It should be 
quite clear. The lemons should be cut in circles ; 
only half the rinds. Tie the pepper in muslin. 

674. DUTCH RECIPE FOR PRESERVING FRUIT 
(Cape Colony) 

Make a syrup to the proportion of two cups of 
sugar to four of water. Let it boil for a few minutes 
in a preserving pan. If it is not clear, strain through 
butter muslin. Then put two or three pounds of 
fruit in it at a time while the syrup is boiling, and 
simmer from ten to twenty minutes, according to 
the kind of fruit ; the latter should be soft and 
clear when done, and unbroken. Take the bottles, 
previously warmed, fill to the top with fruit and 
a little syrup. Screw them down tightly. Then 
add more fruit to the boiling syrup until it is used. 
Do not forget to screw the covers more tightly the 
following day. If you have no screw bottles, pour 
boiling mutton suet on the top of each bottle when 
cold, about a quarter of an inch thick. Any syrup 
over can be bottled and used as a fruit drink. Add 
vinegar and water to it at the table. Must be kept 
in a dry place. Will keep for months. 



FRUIT CHEESES AND PASTES 
675. ALMACKS (Kent, 1809) 

Equal quantities of plums, pears, and apples, cut 
in slices, put into an earthen jar and baked. When 
thoroughly done, squeeze them through a colander. 
To three pounds of fruit, add one poimd of moist 
sugar, and let it simmer gently for some time till it 



266 JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 

becomes a thick jam, then put it into saucers or 
shallow pans, and let it stand on the kitchen rack 
for a day to stiffen and dry. When dried so, it will 
keep in paper. 

676. APPLE CHEESE (1815) 

Pare and quarter your apples and take out the 
cores, put them into a deep pot or jar, and put the 
paring and cores at the top ; let them bake in a 
moderate oven till quite soft ; take off the parings, 
cores, and bits of apple which are at the top, i£ they 
are dry or hard ; then put your apples into a stew- 
pan, with fine powdered sugar to your taste, and 
boil them four hours till it is quite stiff. Put the 
cheese in moulds or cups, and lay paper over it 
moistened with brandy ; set it in a dry place, and 
in three weeks it wiU cut quite smooth. N.B. — 
You may add a little of the rind of a lemon grated, 
or a few drops of essence of lemon, before you put 
it into the moulds; also a few blanched almonds 
cut into small pieces and mixed with it. 

677. APPLE PASTE (Middlesex) 

Peel and core some fine apples and boU them in 
water. When quite soft, take them out and put 
them in cold water ; having drained them, press 
them through a coarse cloth ; put this marmalade 
into a pan on the fire, stir it frequently with a wooden 
spoon, and when it is nearly dry, take it out and 
add an equal weight of sugar, mixing them well 
together. Press the mixture flat, of the thickness 
of an ordinary piecrust ; put it upon tins and place 
to dry in a slack oven. 



JAMS, JELLIES, PEESERVES, ETC. 267 

678. APRICOT PASTE (Middlesex) 

Set any quantity of the fruit you may require 
over the fire in a stewpan, and cook till they are 
quite soft ; then take out the stones, pass the fruit 
through a sieve, and dry. Then take clarified sugar 
equal in weight to the fruit, mix, and let them press 
well together. Turn out into shapes, and dry in a 
slow oven or in the sun. 



679. BULLACE CHEESE (Eighteenth Century) 

Take your bullaces when they are full ripe, and 
to every quart of fruit put a quarter of a pound of 
loaf sugar beaten small. Put them in a jar in 
moderate oven to bake till they are soft, then rub 
them through a hair sieve, and to every pound of 
pulp, add half a pound of loaf sugar crushed fine. 
Then boil it four and a half hours over a slow 
fire, and keep stirring it all the time. Put it into 
pots, and tie brandy papers over them, and keep 
them in a dry place. When it has stood a few 
months, it will cut out very bright and fine. You 
may make sloe cheese the same way. 



680. CHERRY CHEESE (1815) 

Stone some Kentish cherries, crack as many 
of the stones as you choose, blanch the kernels in 
boiling water, and mix them with the fruit ; to every 
twelve poxmds of fruit add three pounds of Lisbon 
sugar ; boil it to a thick jam, and when the fruit no 
longer cleaves to the pan, it is done enough. 



268 JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 

681. BLACK CURRANT PASTE (Middlesex) 

The best way of making black currant paste is to 
dissolve an ounce of isinglass in about half a pint of 
the filtered juice, and equal weight of sugar ; put 
them in a stewpan, and let them simmer for at 
least an hour, then pour out the juice into a very 
shallow tin mould, and when it is cold and quite 
hard, cut it into pieces. 

682. DAMSON CHEESE (1816) 

Pick the damsons free from stalks, leaves, etc., 
put them into a jar and tie white paper over them ; 
bake them in a slow oven till quite soft, rub them 
through a colander while hot ; put the pulp and 
juice which has passed through the colander into 
a stewpan, with fine powdered sugar to your taste ; 
boil it over a moderate fire tUl it is as stiff as you 
can possibly stir it, which will take three hours ; 
keep stirring it to prevent it burning to the pan ; 
and a few minutes before you take it off the fire, 
put the kernels of the damsons into the pan, and 
mix with it ; put it into cups or moulds, let it stand 
a day, and cut some pieces of writing paper the size 
of the tops of the cups or moulds, dip them in 
brandy and put close over them : put them in a dry 
place, and they will keep for several years. 
You may make plum or buUace cheese the same 
way. It is necessary to take the skins off the kernels 
before you put them into the pan. 

683. DAMSON CHEESE (Cheshire) 

Put your damsons in a large stone jar, and tie 
it over tight, and put it in the oven tiE the fruit 



JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 269 

is soft and the juice running out. Rub the fruit 
through the sieve till you have got the pulp out. 
Add three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every 
pound of pulp. Boil it well. Try a little in a 
saucer, and if it sets, it will be boiled enough. 
Break the stones and put in the kernels or some 
blanched bitter almonds while boiling. Stir all the 
time, as it soon bums. 

684 GOOSEBERRY PASTE (Surrey) 
Take some gooseberries from which you have 
extracted the juice for jelly, without drawing them 
very closely. Pass them through a sieve, weigh 
them, and boU the pulp for about one and a quartei 
hours, until it forms a dry paste in the pan. Lift 
it o£E the fire and stir in six ounces of good pounded 
sugar to each pound of fruit. When this is nearly 
dissolved, boil the mixture for twenty to twenty- 
five minutes ; stir it incessantly, or it will be likely to 
burn. Put it into moulds or shallow dishes, and 
use it as wanted for table. 

685. CONSERVE OR PASTE OF PEACHES 

(Middlesex) 

Make a marmalade of ripe peaches in an iron pot, 
with three-quarters of a pound of sugar to every 
pound of fruit ; stir frequently, taking care they do 
not burn ; dry the marmalade carefully on a hot 
plate, or in a slack oven ; and when nearly dry, 
mix a quarter of a pound of the marmalade with a 
pound of very finely pounded sugar ; press it into 
the form of a cake, drying thoroughly, and it will 
keep for almost any length of time. It carmot be 
dried too slowly. 



270 JAMS, JELLIES, PRESERVES, ETC. 

686. LOZENGES OF RED ROSES 
(Seventeenth Century) 

(Proportions not given.) Boil your sugar to sugar 
again {i.e. till it candies) ; then put in your red roses, 
being finely beaten and made moist with the juice 
of a lemon. Let it not boil after the roses are in, 
but pour it upon a pie plate and cut it into what 
form you please. 



CHAPTER XVII 

SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 

Note. — The home-made sweetmeat is so pure, so 
wholesome, and so attractive, as compared with the 
manufactured article, that one need hardly utter a 
syllable in its praise. It is its own praise. The old 
MS. books to which I have had access, did not deal 
with any great variety of confections : theirs are, 
as a rule, simple sugary affairs at best, with a 
modest flavouring or colouring. 

Either the involved and artistic achievements of 
the present day, it would seem, were beyond the 
scope of our mothers, or they did not trouble 
to set down the secrets thereof. These, therefore, 
are more or less of a familiar nursery type : but 
such as they are, they are always a source of gratifi- 
cation : pure of glucose and of baneful colouring 
matters, safe and sound to eat. 

A buttered dish is indispensable in sweetmaking, 
and a very sharp knife. " Lined " saucepans or 
copper preserving pans must be used : and it is 
hardly necessary to remark that all utensils should 
be exquisitely clean. 

687. CANDIED ANGELICA (Middlesex) 
When the stems are of a good size and before they 
run to seed, cut them into slices, and put them for 

271 



272 SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 

some time into cold water after having removed the 
rind : then boil them until they become soft, and 
wash them afterwards two or three times in cold 
water ; boil them in strong syrup for an hour, then 
let them stand for twenty-four hours ; now take 
them out of the syrup, and drain them. In the 
meantime, strengthen the syrup by the addition 
of more sugar, and afterwards let the angelica 
simmer in it for half an hour. It is then to be taken 
out, placed upon tins, and dried in a slow oven, or 
on a hot plate, powdering it well with white sugar. 
Angelica preserved in this way will remain good for 
several years. 

688. BURNT ALMONDS (Eighteenth Century) 

Take two pounds of loaf sugar, and two pounds 
of almonds, put them in a stewpan with a pint of 
water, set them over a clear coal fire, let them boil 
till you hear the almonds crack. Take them off 
and stir them about till they are quite dry ; then 
put them in a wire sieve and shake all the sugar from 
them. Put the sugar into the pan again with a 
Uttle water, give it a boil, put four (tea ?) spoonfuls 
of scraped cochineal to colour it. Put the almonds 
into the pan ; keep stirring them over the fire tiU 
they are quite dry. They will keep twelve months 
in a glass jar. 

689. BURNT ALMONDS, RED (1815) 

Take some of the finest Jordan almonds you can 
get, sift all the dust from them, have some syrup 
boiling in a pan, and let it boil tm it comes almost 



SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 273 

to caramel ; put half a (tea ? ) cupful of cochineal 
in ; put the almonds in as fast as you can, and 
stir them till they are cold ; then put them in your 
sieve, and break those that stick together; then 
have another pan of syrup boiling, the same as 
before, and when they are cold, pick them from 
each other, for they must always have the coats of 
sugar on them. See that your cochineal is properly 
mixed to make them of a fine colour, as you must 
put more cochineal in the last coat than you did in 
the first. 



690. BURNT ALMONDS, WHITE (1815) 

Take some of the finest Jordan almonds you can 
get, and sift all the dust from them ; then have some 
syrup boiling in a pan, and let it boil till it comes 
almost to a caramel ; put your almonds in, and stir 
them till they are cold ; put them in your sieve, 
break those that stick together, and then have 
another pan of syrup boiling, the same as before, 
and give them two coats of sugar ; when done, pick 
them from each other. 



691. ALMOND PASTE (Somerset) 

Take one pound of ground almonds, one pound 
of castor sugar, one tablespoonful of orange-flower 
water, eight or nine drops of essence of almonds, 
two whole eggs and one white of egg. Mix sugar 
and almonds well together ; add orange-flower water 
and essence of almonds. Beat the eggs well and 
knead them into it. If to be used on a cake, spread 
the paste on with a knife dipped in hot water,

692. CANDIED APRICOTS (Surrey) 

Take some apricots which are not quite ripe, and 
remove the stones without entirely dividing the 
fruit. Put them into cold water ; then blanch them 
on the fire ; when they become soft, take them off, 
and put them again into cold water. When they are 
cold, drain them, and throw them into some clarified 
sugar, which has been made into a thick syrup 
while it is in a boiling state ; let the whole boil 
again for a few minutes, and let. them stand for 
twenty-four hours. Take out the apricots, and give 
the syrup another boil, then throw it boiling over 
the fruit, and let all stand another twenty-four 
hours ; after which take them out, drain them, put 
them on dishes which have been well covered with 
powdered sugar, dry them in a stove, and lay them 
by in a box, placed in layers, with a sheet of paper 
between each. 

693. CANDIED BARBERRIES (Surrey) 

Make a good strong syrup, and when it boils, put 
in your barberries in bunches (the proportion of 
syrup should be two pounds of sugar to three pounds 
of barberries), and let them simmer a few minutes. 
Then lift them out and let them get cold. The 
next day boil them again in the sugar for about half 
an hour. When cold, take them out and powder 
them with sugar, and let them dry under glasses in 
the sun, 

694. BARLEY SUGAR (Middlesex) 

Melt some sugar over the fire with a decoction of 
barley, mixed with whites of eggs, well beaten into 



SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 275 

a light froth : this is then passed through a jelly- 
bag, and again boiled till it forms large bubbles : 
then throw it out on a marble slab or flat dish, 
which has been lightly rubbed over with oil of sweet 
almonds : when the bubbles disappear, it is rolled 
into round sticks, and left to cool and harden. 

695. BARLEY SUGAR (Surrey) 

Put into a lined saucepan a good handful of fine 
barley, and the thinly pared rind of half a lemon. 
Pour in one quart of cold water, and let it simmer for 
two hours. Then let it stand and settle ; when it 
has settled, pour off the water carefully. Pour a 
pint of what is left, with two pounds of loaf sugar, 
into a pan, and stand it over a gentle heat until the 
sugar is melted, then let it boil. Add the juice of 
one lemon, and boil up again till it begins to crack. 
Pour it out on to a buttered dish, and when cool cut 
it into strips. When these are almost cold, hold 
them at either end and twist them in opposite 
directions. 

696. BLACK CURRANT DROPS (1816) 

Get half a sieve of black currants, put them in a 
pan ; mash them with your spaddle, and put them 
over the fire ; bring them just to a boU, and pass 
them through a sieve over an earthen pan. Put 
what jelly comes from them in an earthen pipkin, 
and put it over the fire and let it boil for two hours ; 
stir it all the time at bottom with your spaddle, or 
else it will bum ; put in two pounds and a half of 
powdered sugar, mix it with the jam and stir it 
over the fire half an hour. Drop it on metal sheets or 



276 SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 

plates, in little drops from your knife, and put them 
in your hot stove ; let them be there tUl you find 
they are quite dry, and then take them off with your 
knife. 

697. BUTTERSCOTCH (Middlesex) 

Take one pound of lump sugar and half a pint of 
milk, stir them together ia a saucepan over the fire 
until the sugar is thoroughly melted. Then add 
half a pound of butter, dropping in little bits at a 
time, and a pinch of cream-of-tartar. Mix well, 
and boil the butterscotch until a piece will set into 
a fairly hard ball on being dropped into cold water. 
Pour it upon an oiled or buttered tin, and out it into 
small squares when sufficiently set. 

698. CHOCOLATE ALMONDS (Surrey) 

Blanch your almonds : melt some good chocolate 
in a lined pan, thinning it if necessary with a very 
little syrup. Dip the almonds in, one at a time, 
upon a long pin, and lay them to dry upon a 
buttered dish. 

699. CHOCOLATE DROPS (1815) 

Take one pound and a half of chocolate, and 
put it in the oven just to warm the chocolate ; then 
put it into a copper stewpan, with three-quarters 
of a pound of powdered sugar ; mix it well over 
the fire, take it off, and roll it in pieces the size of 
small marbles ; put them on white paper, and when 
they are all on, take the sheet of paper by each 
comer, and lift it up and down, so that the paper 
may touch the table each time, and by that means 



SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 277 

you will see the drops come quite flat, about the 
size of a sixpence ; put some sugar nonpareils over 
them, and cover all that are on the paper, and then 
shake them off, and you will see all the chocolate 
drops covered with the sugar nonpareils. Let them 
stand till cold, and they will come off well, and then 
put them in a papered box. 

700. COCONUT CANDY (Hampshire) 

Take one and a half pounds of white sugar and 
put it with three-quarters of a piut of cold water to 
boil in a lined saucepan. When the sugar has dis- 
solved, boil for five minutes, then strain it, and mix 
in, thoroughly well, one and a half pounds of grated 
coconut. Put the saucepan close to the fire and 
stir the mixture until it begins to candy. Then 
spread it on sheets of white paper which have been 
made warm, or on a warmed tin, well buttered. 
Before the candy is quite cold, take off the paper, 
and cut it into squares Let it get quite dry before 
being stored. If you wish any to be pink, divide 
the mixture into two pans (before putting in the 
coconut), and colour the syrup in one of these with 
a little cochineal. 

701. COCONUT CANDY (Surrey) 

Take a fresh coconut, rasp it very fine, spread it 
on a dish, and let it dry naturally for two or three 
days. To every four oimces of grated coconut 
add one pound of sugar (but you can add more 
coconut if you choose). Boil the sugar to a syrup ; 
when it has boiled about ten minutes, and begins 
to be thick and white, stir in the nut, mix it well, 



278 SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 

and do not leave it a moment till it is done. Stand 
the pan over, not on, the fixe, as this candy bums 
very easily. For almond candy, proceed the same, 
but first dry the almonds in a gentle oven, and do 
not put them to the sugar till it approaches candying 
point. 

702. ANOTHER WAY 

Take two pounds of powdered sugar, set it in a 
lined saucepan, just covered with water. Let it 
boil till it is brittle, then take it off the fire. Have 
ready two whites of eggs well beaten, and beat them 
as quick as you can into the sugar. When the 
mixture is quite cool, add either a grated coconut 
(fresh), or the same amount of desiccated coconut 
and ten or twelve drops of lemon-juice. Then pour 
off into a buttered dish or pan, and cut it in strips. 
For pink candy, set half the mixture in a separate 
saucepan, and colour it with a little cochineal. 

703. COCONUT ICE (Hampshire) 

Take one grated fresh coconut, two pounds of 
loaf sugar, a small piece of butter, one tablespoonful 
of cream, a little cochineal. (A very large nut will 
require three pounds of sugar, and water in propor- 
tion.) Take the coconut mUk, and add water 
sufiicient to make half a pint all together. Add the 
sugar, and boil well for ten minutes, then stir in 
the grated nut and boU another ten minutes. Take 
it off the fire, add the cream, and beat the mixture 
well until it begins to set. Pour half into a buttered 
soup-plate ; add a little cochineal to the other half, 
and pour this on top of the first when it is set enough 
to bear it. When cold, cut it up into strips. 



SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 279 

704. TO CANDY COWSLIPS OR ANY OTHER 
FLOWERS IN BUNCHES (Seventeenth Century) 

Steep gum arabic in water, wet the flowers with 
it, and shake them in a cloth that they may dry, 
Then dip them in fine sifted sugar, and hang them 
on a string across a stove or chimney-piece when 
there is a fire. They must hang for two or three 
days, until the flowers are quite dry. 



705. CANDIED FILBERTS (Middlesex) 

Blanch them, and when the skins are removed, let 
them simmer iu very thin syrup for about an hour : 
put them to cool, and then set them on the flre again, 
adding more sugar, so as to thicken the syrup ; 
simmer for another hour, and then let them cool. 
Repeat this process a third time, adding more sugar, 
until the syrup has become so thick as to candy 
when cold : take out the filberts before the syrup 
is cold, and cover them well with pounded loaf sugar : 
then dry in the sun or in a slow oven. The syrup 
may be used for any other preserve. 

706. HARDBAKE (Surrey) 

Put one pound of Demerara sugar into a saucepan 
with enough water to make a strong syrup — half 
a pint more or less. Boil the sugar until it sets when 
dropped into cold water. Meanwhile have split 
blanched almonds laid in rows, flat side down, upon 
a buttered dish. Pour the S3Tup over the almonds, 
and put the dish in a cool place. When the hard- 
bake is quite dry and hard, cut it into pieces, and 
keep it in a dry tin. 



280 SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 

707. LEMON PRALINES (Hampshire) 

Peel some lemons thinly, and cut the peels into 
small narrow strips about an inch long. Put one 
pound of powdered loaf sugar to boil in one tea- 
cupful of water, and when the sugar is dissolved put 
in a quarter of a pound of butter, beaten to a cream. 
Keep stirring it over the fire until it will nearly set 
if dropped upon a dish. At this point put in the 
lemon strips. Lift the pan from the fire, and stir 
the lemon strips about till it is nearly cold, with a 
wooden or silver spoon. Then put them in a sieve 
to drain. To be kept in a dry tin. Some people 
add six drops of essence of lemon just before putting 
in the strips. 

708. LEMON PRAWLONGS (1815) 

Take some lemons and peel the rind oJBE in four 
quarters ; take all the white off from the inside of 
the rind ; cut the yellow rind in pieces, about one 
inch long and about the tenth part of an inch wide. 
Have a pan of boiling syrup on the fire, and let it 
boil till it comes almost to caramel ; then put the 
prawlongs in, and stir them very much with a large 
wooden spoon, till they are cold ; put them in a large 
sieve, and shake them just to let the sugar that does 
not stick to them go through the sieve ; lastly, put 
them in your box, and keep them in a dry place. 

709. CANDIED LEMON OR ORANGE CHIPS (Kent) 

Cut the fruit in halves : take out all the pulp and 
juice. Boil the rinds till quite tender, drain them on 
a cloth, and cut them into chips. Weigh an equal 



SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 281 

quantity of white sugar, and to every pound of sugar 
put a pint of water ; set it on the fire, and when 
it is quite dissolved put on the chips. Boil quickly on 
a clear fire, about half an hour, or tiU you perceive 
it begin to candy, then take it off. When quite 
cool, spread it upon a dish or slab, and continue 
to move it about during two or three days, so as to 
separate it. It wiU take a fortnight to dry in the 
sun, or in a cool oven. When dry enough, put it 
up in folds of paper. 

710. MARZIPAN (Middlesex) 

Mix a quarter of a pound of icing sugar with a 
quarter of a pound of ground almonds. Add in 
the white of one egg well beaten, and a pinch of salt. 
Mix this well with a wooden spoon, and if it is too 
stiff use a little orange-flower water (not more than 
a teaspoonful) ; but on no account make it too wet. 
Put it into a basin and let it stand for twenty-four 
hours. It can then be rolled out about half an inch 
thick and cut into shapes, or made into smaU balls 
to imitate fruits, with a strip of angelica as stalk. 
This is a cheap and wholesome sweet. 

711. MARZIPAN POMME DE TERRE (American) 

Take half a pound of ground almonds, half a 
pound of icing sugar, one egg, and the yolk of 
another, chocolate powder, and a few drops of 
essence of almonds. Proceed as above. 

712. MARZIPAN POTATOES (Hampshire) 

To six ounces of ground almonds, add three- 
quarters of a pound of sifted icing sugar, twelve 



282 SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 

drops of orange-flower water (or a little brandy), and 
a few drops of almond essence. Mix to a stiff 
paste with the beaten white of an egg (sometimes 
two eggs are needed). Roll the paste into small 
pieces, potato shapes, and roll them in a mixture of 
castor sugar and grated chocolate. 



713. NOUGAT (Middlesex) 

Blanch a pound of sweet almonds, and, having 
sliced them lengthways, let them lie in the sim for a 
short time, until they become slightly discoloured. 
Now dissolve, in an iron stewpan shghtly buttered, 
twelve ounces of sugar without water, stirring 
constantly, and when the sugar has melted, and 
begins to change colour, throw in the almonds, 
which are previously to be made thoroughly hot, 
in another vessel, over the fire, but without burning 
them. Mix them well with the sugar, and, as they 
mix, range them round the sides of the saucepan, 
leaving about the same thickness at the bottom as 
at the sides : now, let the saucepan become a little 
cool, and turn out the mixture upon a plate : having 
done this, press the contents well together in the 
form of a thick cake, and wrap up in writing paper. 
It should be kept in a dry tin. 

714. ORANGE-FLOWER CANDY (Middlesex) 

Throw some orange flowers into syrup (proportion 
not stated) when it has boiled about ten minutes ; 
and after they have simmered in it for five minutes 
more, pour the whole out, and leave them to infuse 
until the following day, or even longer if convenient. 



SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 283 

Then bring the syrup to the boiling point again, 
strain it from the blossoms through a piece of 
muslin, and lay it quickly in cakes, with a large 
spoon, upon thick and very dry sheets of paper or 
tin. Take the candy off before it is quite cold, and 
lay it reversed upon dishes. This, kept secure 
against air, will be excellent for more than a year. 

715. PEPPERMINT CREAMS (Hampshire) 

Take the white of an egg (not beaten), add half 
its quantity of cold water. Stir well to mix the two 
together. Put in enough icing sugar to make it 
stiff enough to handle : mould into any shape 
desired. Flavour with essence of peppermint. 
Vanilla creams are prepared the same as above, 
only with vanilla flavouring instead of peppermint. 
Shape into balls, and put a piece of dried walnut at 
top and bottom. 

716. CRYSTALLIZED ROSES OR VIOLETS (Siirrey) 

Select large sweet rose-petals, set them in rows 
before you on a pasteboard. Have a thoroughly 
good strong sjrrup boiling, and dip the rose-leaves 
in, one at a time — let them be thoroughly coated, 
then set them on a sieve to drain and dry. 

717. SUGAR CANDY (Middlesex) 

Clarify four pounds of lump sugar, which must 
be allowed to simmer with a little water, over the 
fire, until by taking up a little on a spoon, and 
blowing on it, you find it fly off in small flakes : 
then having skimmed it well, take it off the fire, 
throw into it a glass of good spirits of wine, and 



284 SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 

pour the whole out mto an earthen dish : cover it 
over and put it into an oven for eight days, taking 
care to keep it of an equal temperature : at the 
end of that time, drain o£E the syrup, and the candy 
will remain attached to the dish, which must be 
warmed in order to allow the candy more readily 
to be detached. 

718. TO KNOW WHEN SUGAR IS AT CANDY 

HEIGHT (Yorkshire, 1769) 

Take some sugar and clarify it, keep it boiling 
till it becomes thick, then stir it with a stick from you, 
and when it is at candy height, it will fly from your 
stick like flakes of snow, or feathers flying in the air. 
And till it comes to that height, it will not fly. 
Then you may use it as you please. 

719. TO MAKE SUGAR-PLUMS OF ANY SORT (Surrey) 

Take a copper pan which has not only a handle 
of some sort across the middle, but two side holes 
or handles. Suspend it from a rack, or otherwise, 
about four inches above a charcoal brazier or red- 
hot fire. Put the articles which are to be sugar 
coated — blanched almonds, nuts, walnuts, or what- 
ever they are — into the pan with some strong syrup. 
Shake the pan so that every part of the articles may 
be covered, and keep on gently agitating it until 
the sugar has dried on them. Then add more syrup, 
and agitate till dry ; and so on until the coating is 
as thick as you desire. The original shape of the 
articles will in this way be preserved, and they 
will be covered with any thickness of sugar required. 
The same applies to any paste of fruit and sugar ; 
but this must be dry before going into the pan. 



SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 285 

720. FRUIT PASTES FOR SUGAR PLUMS (Surrey) 

You take the fruit — black currants, damsons, 
quinces, etc. — whatever it may be, and boil it till 
it is so soft it can be put through a sieve, all except 
the skins and stones. Then put the pulp back again 
in the pan and boil it again till the moisture is 
evaporated. Then put in three-quarters of a pound 
of sugar to every pound of pulp, mix it in well, and 
let it go on boiUng slowly till it becomes a firm, 
smooth paste. It must be put into pots and well 
covered with brandied paper and butter paper. 

721. TOFFEE (Kent) 

Take half a pound of coarse sugar, two ounces 
of butter, one tablespoonful of vinegar, a piece of 
lemon peel. Boil them together for half an hour. 
Butter a large dish all over, and pour on thinly. 

722. DEVONSHIRE TOFFEE 

Mix granulated sugar with cream just beginning 
to " turn," until it assumes the consistency of a 
very thick batter. Put it into a lined saucepan 
and keep on stirring until it is smooth and white 
and thoroughly cooked. Then add a spoonful of 
jam, raspberry for preference : give it another stir-up, 
pour it into a buttered tin, and cut it into squares 
before it has set hard. 

723. EVERTON TOFFEE (Lancashire) 

Take one pound of butter, quarter of a pound of 
treacle, one pound of sugar (two tablespoonfuls of 
water to be first put in the pan). AU to be boiled 
together for three-quarters of an hour. 



286 SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 

724. RUSSIAN TOFFEE (Surrey) 

This is much richer and better than ordinary 
toffee. Take half a pint of thick sour cream (or, 
if this cannot be had, condensed milk), and stir into 
it one pound of castor sugar. Boil it slowly over a 
clear fire till it is all dissolved and begins to thicken. 
Then add two teaspoonfuls of vanilla essence and 
one tablespoonful of whisky. Boil it up again until 
it froths and leaves the sides of the pan clear ; then 
turn it out on to a buttered dish slab, and when it 
sets, cut it into squares. If made with condensed 
milk, one small tin will sufifice for the same amount 
of sugar ; boil until it hardens when dropped into 
cold water ; then add one teaspoonful of vanilla 
essence and the juice of half a lemon, and boil up as 
mentioned above. 

725. TURKISH DELIGHT (Hertfordshire) 

Soak one ounce of gelatine in half a pint of cold 
water for two or three hours ; put into a stewpan 
with two pounds of loai sugar, and when it boils stir 
for twenty minutes ; take off the fire and add two 
teaspoonfuls of vanilla essence, and one of lemon 
essence ; pour into a wet soup plate and let it stand 
for twenty-four hours, then cut into squares and 
cover with icing sugar. 

726. TURKISH DELIGHT (Surrey) 

Boil two breakfastcupfuls of water in a lined 
saucepan, add two ounces of French leaf gelatine, 
and stir it with a wooden spoon. Add two pounds 
of loaf sugar, and go on stirring the mixure till it 
boils : let it boil for twenty minutes, and stir it all 



SWEETMEATS AND CANDIES 287 

the time. Then add a small eggcupful of citric 
acid, and two good tablespoonfuls of rose-water. 
Wet two china pie-dishes with cold water, and pour 
half the mixture into one dish (through a strainer) ; 
put a few drops of cochineal into the other half, and 
pour into the second dish. Before the mixture cools, 
add (if liked) a few chopped nuts or almonds. 
Let it stand twenty-four hours, and then cut it 
into cubes, rolling it well in smooth sifted icing 
sugar. 



CHAPTER XVIII 

CAKES 

Note. — Our mothers, grandmothers, and great- 
grandmothers were what we should consider extra- 
vagant in the matter of eggs. They used eight 
where we should hesitate over four. They liked 
their oakes rich, sweet, and highly flavoured ; and 
they liked them in great variety and plenty. That 
happy institution " high tea," previously mentioned, 
supplied an excellent opportunity for showing 
what the skilful housewife could turn out in this 
respect. Moreover, all important occasions — birth, 
christening, wedding, funeral, re-union of the family 
(as on Simnel or Mothering Sunday), and a host 
of other family functions, now only traditional, 
demanded each its own particular cake. 

Hence it is that not only every coimty has its 
celebrated specialities, as have also a great many 
provincial towns, but families innumerable still 
possess certain favourite cake-recipes, whose sweet- 
ness custom cannot stale. Among those following 
will be found the most interesting and dehghtful 
concoctions ; and especially the reader is desired 
to note the large number of suggestions regarding 
ginger-bread and ginger-cake. For cheapness, 
wholesomeness, and toothsomeness, this nursery

desideratum can hardly be bettered. The (salt) 
Irish potato-cakes are also extremely good. 

The superiority of home-made cakes to " shop 
'uns " is so self-evident, that no attention need be 
called to the fact. A hostess, with a reputation for 
dainty little cakes of private manufacture, has the 
first claim upon the gratitude of those guests who 
are weary of being regaled with the stereotyped 
productions of the local confectioner. Moreover, the 
saving in cost is enormous, and the doubling in 
excellence undeniable. The revelations of mar- 
garine and egg-powder — to say the least of it — 
which shop cakes afford, may well be abandoned in 
favour of the very little extra trouble involved in 
turning out one's own. A good oven is very desir- 
able — neither spasmodically hot, nor irritatingly 
slow. But careful attention will obviate many of 
the faults of a bad one. The baking of a cake is 
at least as important as the making. 

I have found that good beef-dripping (not bought 
dripping) is an excellent substitute for butter, and 
makes a large cake lighter as a rule. It is a good 
plan to warm the flour slightly first, and to mix 
your sugar with the flour, before rubbing in the 
butter or dripping : the work is thus performed 
much more quickly, because the grittiness of the 
sugar helps to break up the fat, especially in cold 
weather. Sour milk or buttermilk is invaluable for 
mixing cakes, rendering them much lighter. Always 
beat the mixture with a fork, unless specially other- 
wise directed. 

Cakes and biscuits, whether stored or in daily use, 
should be kept in closed tins.

be in a solid lump. Bake in rather a slow oven 
for two hours, with paper on the top of shape.

(not bitter), and put it to rise ; mix and knead it as 
you would bread, and add in six well-beaten eggs, 
three-quarters of a pound of sifted sugar, one grated 
nutmeg, and a little warm milk. The dough must 
not be mixed too soft at first, or it wiU be too soft 
to roU up subsequently. Leave it again by the 
fire to rise for an hour or two. Then take out small 
lumps of dough, the size of a smalhsh orange, insert 
into the centre of each a piece of candied peel and 
some currants (some grated lemon-rind also is a 
great improvement) ; roll it up securely. Have ready 
a deep pan of quite boiling lard, and be sure that it 
is quite boiling when the doughnuts are put in : 
let them be completely covered with the lard, and 
boil fifteen minutes over a slow fire. Take out, set 
to drain on paper, and let them get cool gradually 
and not stand in a draught. Dust over with sifted 
sugar. These are first-rate.

sultanas, and currants, one small teaspoonful of 
allspice, a quarter of a pound of candied citron, a 
quarter of a pound of lemon peel (cut into thin 



CAKES 301 

slices). Melt the butter and beat it up with a knife 
before putting it in. The cake should be rolled out 
about one and a half inches thick, marked with a 
knife at the top into small squares, and brushed 
over with white of egg. 

766. ECCLES CAKES (Cumberland) 

A quarter of a pound of currants, which should be 
well washed, a quarter of a pound of moist sugar, a 
little nutmeg, and a little rum, well mixed. Rub 
a pound of butter into a pound of flour, roll out 
about half an inch thick, cut into squares about 
three inches across, then put some of the currant 
mixture in the centre of each square. Wet the edges 
and join the four comers of each square in the 
centre ; turn over and roll lightly with the rolling 
pin, to make a round cake. Bake in a hot oven, 
not too hot. 

767. ETHEL'S CAKES (Susi3ex)

teaspoonful baking powder. Beat the sugar and 
eggs till creamy and frothy ; when bubbling all over, 
add flour and baking powder and turn into greased 
tins, and bake in a very hot oven ; when firm on

f uls of finely grated chocolate to two tablespoonfuls 
of corn starch, and one pound of powdered sugar, 
and stir gradually into two beaten eggs. For coco- 
nut fingers add four tablespoonfuls of grated coco- 
nut. 



769. FLEED CAKES (Kent) 

One pound of flour, half a pound of fleed, quarter 
of a pound of good butter. Rub the fleed and 
butter into the flour and roll well. 

Fleed cakes (says the sender of this recipe) were 
usually seen on every tea-table in Kent when I was 
a girl. Very rich these homemade cakes were. I 
never see or taste such fleed cakes nowadays, puffed 
up in dehcate flakes ! In winter we had another tea- 
cake, made simply of flour and suet cut into the 
shape of a diamond. They were served hot from 
a Dutch oven placed in front of the fire. We know 
an old " woman of Kent " who has her own recipe 
for fleed cakes. Instead of pig's fleed, she uses 
rabbit's fleed. Her hobby is to keep pet rabbits, 
feed them well and keep them happy, when they 
will grow fat. Then kill them, skin them, cut 
them open and take out all the inside fat, or f^eed, 
cook the rabbit as you like it for your dinner, but 
make delicious cakes for your tea with the fleed. 
Bake the cakes in an old-fashioned Dutch oven 
in front of the fire.

770. GALETTE (French) 

Take equal quantities of butter and flour, a little 
salt, and two eggs (in the commoner sorts of galette, 
however, no eggs are used, the ingredients are merely 
flour, buttej, and salt), knead the whole together into 
a paste, roll it as thin as a crown-piece (here we must 
beg to observe that the Paris galette is usually rolled 
to twice the thickness of a crown-piece), and make 
it the size of a dessert plate (or much larger) ; mark 
it with a knife so as to form diamonds ; put it into 
the oven for a quarter of an hour, take it out, beat 
up two eggs with a little cream and some salt, pour 
it over the cake, and return it to the oven to bake 
for another quarter of an hour. 



771. GATEAU A LA MOCHA (Hertfordshire) 

Beat up the yolks of four eggs, with a quarter of 
a pound of powdered loaf sugar, add gradually two 
ounces of flour, two ounces of potato flour, lastly 
the whites of four eggs, whipped to a stiff froth. 
When the whole is well mixed, put it in a buttered 
plain mould and bake ; turn out the cake when done, 
and when it is quite cold, cover it all over with the 
following icing, ornamenting it with piping of the 
icing squeezed through a small rose pipe. When 
the cake is flnished it should be put in a cold place 
on ice till wanted. For the icing, take half a 
pound of fresh butter, and beat it into a cream in 
a bowl, adding drop by drop during the process half 
a teacupful of the strongest coffee that can be made.

quarters of a pound of powdered sugar, and a small 
quantity of candied orange-flowers : mix these 
ingredients well up with whites of eggs, beaten with 
a Httle good cream, and bake them in shapes. Serve

sugar finely pounded, six ounces of cream, as much 
milk, a little orange-flowers, and the rind of a lemon 
grated ; mix the whole well together, taking care 
that the batter is not lumpy ; bake in gaufre irons, 
as for ordinary gaufres. 

774. HARD GINGERBREADS (Hertfordshire) 

A cupful of treacle, a tablespoonful of butter, a 
tablespoonful of cold water, a teaspoonful of ginger, 
a teaspoonful of bi-carbonate of soda, and enough 
flour to make a dough ; bake in a brisk oven. 

775. GINGERBREAD (Kent) 

I 

One pound of flour, one pound of moist sugar, 
a few cloves pounded, one pound of treacle, one 
ounce of butter, a little ginger. 

II 

One pound of treacle, two pounds of flour, one 
and a half ounces of ginger, one pound of sugar,

mgredients. 

in 

One pound of flour, three-quarters of a pound of 
treacle, four ounces of butter, six ounces of brown 
sugar, one ounce prepared ginger, the peel of one 
lemon chopped fine. Mix them well together, and 
bake them in a slow oven. One egg is an improve- 
ment. 

776. GINGERBREAD CAKE (Lancashire) 

One and a half pounds of flour, one and a quarter 
pounds of treacle, one ounce of ginger (ground 
freshly), six ounces of butter, a quarter of a pound of 
brown sugar, a lemon or Seville orange (both peel 
and juice), three teaspoonfuls of baking powder. 
Melt the butter in the treacle, add a little warm 
milk, and pour into the dry ingredients. Mixture 
must be rather soft. Bake four hours in a slow oven. 
This is an old and excellent recipe. 

777. GINGERBREAD (Middlesex) 

Three pounds of treacle are to be mixed with 
three pounds and a half of good flour, a pound of 
fresh butter, and a pound of brown sugar, five 
ounces of caraway seeds, six ounces of candied 
orange and lemon peel, cut very small, a quarter 
of a pound of powdered ginger, five eggs, and 
rather more than haK an otince of pearl-ashes : the 
butter is mixed with the other ingredients by being 
beaten to a cream. The mixture must stand for 
20 



306 CAKES 

twenty-four hours, and on the following day is to 
be worked up like bread, and baked into a cake, 
of about an inch thick, in a slow oven. The same 
mixture, made more liquid, and without the pearl- 
ashes, the butter being melted instead of beaten, 
dropped with a spoon upon a buttered tin, makes 
gingerbread nuts ; but it is usual to put a larger 
quantity of ginger. Gingerbread nuts are also made 
by rubbing up a pound of butter with two pounds of 
flour, a pound of brown sugar, and rather more 
than an ounce of powdered ginger. These are 
mixed together with as much treacle as will form 
them into the consistency of dough : it is then made 
into the form of nuts, and baked upon tins. In order 
to make them richer, a little powdered allspice 
and powdered cinnamon may be added. Nutmeg 
and crushed or powdered almonds may be added 
either to gingerbread or gingerbread nuts. 

778. GINGEEBREAD (Yorkshire) 

Two poimds of flour, one pound of treacle, one

butter, one pound of treacle, and one pound of sugar. 
Melt the butter and mix well with the treacle and

peel grated or shredded very fine. Beat all well to- 
gether, drop it very thin and bake in a moderate 



CAKES 307 

oven. Cut it out in squares and just turn it round 
the finger, and put it in a canister. Take it out 
only as it is wanted for use, or it will turn soft. 
(This is equivalent to Ormskirk gingerbread, a well- 
known Lancashire dainty. But the ginger has been 
omitted. It would be as well to add about half 
an ounce of ground ginger. Ed.) 

780. GINGER-CAKE (Isle of Wight) 

Mix into one pound of flour, a quarter of a pound 
of butter, one tablespoonful of powdered sugar, one 
penny packet of baking powder, two teaspoonfuls of

before you can work it in. Beat all well together, 
and bake for two hours in a slow oven.

flour, two ounces of castor sugar, and a pinch of salt ; 
rub in gently but thoroughly a quarter of a pound of 
butter. Shghtly beat up one egg, mix with it one 
tablespoonful of milk or cream. Make a hole in 
the middle of the flour, pour in the egg and milk ; 
mix into the flour with a knife, and then knead it 
well with the hand till all the flour is weU mixed. 
It must be a soft paste. Flour a board and roll 
out the paste half an inch thick and cut into any 
shape desired. Ornament the edges, decorate the 
top with caraway seeds, place on a greased paper 
on a tin, and bake.

851. SAFFRON CAKE (Cornwall) 

One and a half pounds of flour (if self-raising flour 
is not used, add four teaspoonfuls of baking powder), 
half a pint of milk, one pound of fruit (raisins, 
currants, or both), three ounces of candied peel, 
six ounces of brown sugar, six ounces of butter (to 
be creamed along with the sugar), two eggs, a pinch 
of salt, and three pennyworth of saffron. Put the 
saffron in the oven over-night, or for an hour when 
the oven is quick, to " draw " it well, in a cup with a 
little hot water. Then strain it, well squeezing out 
the essence. Add it to the milk and eggs, which 
have been well beaten (yolks and whites separately), 
and mix this to the dry ingredients. The above 
amount will make two good-sized cakes. Bake 
two hours or more. (Some people dry their 
saffron, then crush it to powder and mix it with 
the flour.)

874. LITTLE TEA-BISCUITS (MACAROON AND 
COCONUT) (Surrey) 

Beat up the white of an egg to a stiff froth ia a 
basin. Gradually add half a pound of castor sugar 
and a few drops of essence of almonds. Mix into a 
thick white paste, and drop pieces of it, with a spoon, 
upon a sheet of rice paper or tissue paper, keeping 
them about half an inch apart. This paper, of 
course, must be first laid upon the oven sheet. Put 
the biscuits in a slow oven till they colour to a pale 
drab, then take them out, and when cold remove 
them from the paper with a sharp silver knife. 
A somewhat similar style of biscuits may be made, 
by substituting a quarter of a pound of grated coco- 
nut for the castor sugar and almond essence. About 
a teaspoonful of sugar will be required only ; and a 
little cochineal will colour some of these as a pretty 
variety. 

875. TEA CAKES (Middlesex)

880. ICED TRIFFIES (Hertfordshire) 

Whisk three eggs with five ounces of castor sugar 
to a stiff batter, and flavour with a few drops of 
vanilla essence, then sift in five ounces of pastry 
flour. With the batter, half fill some fancy-shaped 
bun-tins which are well greased with butter, and 
bake in a sharp oven from ten to twenty minutes. 
During this time prepare the icing as foUows : Mix 
in a basin six ounces of poimded sweet almonds, a 
dessertspoonful of pounded bitter almonds, four 
ounces of grated chocolate, and four ounces of fine 
icing sugar. Meanwhile dissolve in a double boiler 
one ounce of butter and a beaten egg. This dissolved 
butter and egg should be gradually added to the dry 
ingredients till the icing is of the right consistency. 
Spread this over the top and sides of the little cakes, 
smooth with a knife dipped into boiling water, and 
set in a cool oven to harden a little. Afterwards 
place each little cake in a small fancy d'oyley or 
paper.

CHAPTER XIX 

BREAD, ROLLS, BUNS, MUFFINS, TEA- 
CAKES, SCONES, ETC. 

Note. — That the art and practice of making our 
own bread has, in large measure, died out from 
among us, is one of the most lamentable signs of 
modem so-called civilisation. We allow the baker, 
with his alum, bone-flour, and other unnecessary 
ingredients, to supply us with that " staff of 
life," which should surely be a sound and trust- 
worthy staff if it is to be any good at all. We 
speak of home-made bread as though it were some 
treasure beyond our attainment. Now, in remote 
country villages, where brewer's yeast is almost 
unprocurable, one can understand the art of bread- 
making dwindling down to nothing ; although, even 
there, yeast can be made quite easily — witness the 
recipes at the end of this section. But in towns, 
where the breweries are only too glad to get rid of 
their yeast for the asking, there need be no such 
difficulty. (I do not allude to German or com- 
position yeast ; it really is not a patch upon the 
genuine article.) Then, the absence of the old- 
fashioned brick oven is a great drawback in towns ; 
but here, again, some of the best bread I have ever 
eaten was baked by a Hammersmith woman in an 

343

oil-stove. The Daily Mail bread-making competition 
proved, to the satisfaction of all well-wishers to 
humanity, that there are still many wives and 
mothers who have solved one of the secrets of good 
health ; for that home-made bread and good health 
are frequently synonymous, is a fact to be verified 
by experience. 

The few and uninteresting breads, buns, scones, 
etc., obtainable at a shop, can be supplemented 
— or, I hope, replaced — from the following hst, with 
the most varied and toothsome productions. I 
desire to commend this section to everybody who 
can appreciate the difference between bread made 
for eating, and bread made for selling. It is a differ- 
ence not to be stated in mere words. 

Amongst minor items, the reader should par- 
ticularly note the delicious Cornish Saffron Buns. 



886. TO MAKE HOUSEHOLD BREAD OB ROLLS 

, (Middlesex) 

Take ten pounds of flour, and three quarts of water 
which is about lukewarm, if in summer, and rather 
warmer in winter. Put the water in a large pan, 
and add a tablespoonful of salt. Add a portion of 
the flour, stirring it up well, until it is of the con- 
sistency of butter, adding rather more than a pint 
of good yeast ; then add more flour, mixing the 
whole well, and put the pan, covered with a cloth, 
and throwing flour over the dough, before the fire 
for a few minutes. About a third of the flour is to 
be kept back in the first operation, and this is to be 
weE kneaded in when the mixture which has been 



BREAD, ROLLS, BUNS, MUFFINS, ETC. 345 

placed before the fire has risen properly. Put the 
dough again before the fire, and let it rise for a few 
minutes, then knead again, and bake in a quick oven, 
having previously put the dough into pans, and 
pricked the surface of the dough with a fork, and 
placed it again before the fire in the pans. The 
baking, in an ordinary oven, will require about an 
hour for a four-pound loaf and fifty minutes for a 
loaf of three pounds. If a heated oven is used, 
it must be well-heated before the dough is put 
into it. If potatoes be mixed with the bread in 
the proportion of an ounce to two ounces to the 
one pound,- the flavour, (to some people's thinking) 
will be improved. The potatoes must be first 
boiled in their skins, then skinned, and when 
dry, rubbed well up in milk or water boiled and al- 
lowed to stand for a few minutes before it is used. 
Then add the mixture to the dish in which the dough 
is mixed. Rice may also be used. Take a pound 
of rice to ten pounds of wheat flour, boil it in one 
quart of water tUl the rice has become a complete 
pulp. Strain off the water, and beat the rice well in 
a mortar until it is completely crushed, and is 
entirely dissolved, then add the water in which it 
was boiled, and a pint of milk, and boil the whole to- 
gether for an hour. Strain off the liquid and add it 
to the dish in which the dough is made, suppressing 
as much water from the process as the quantity of 
liquid obtained from the boiling of the rice will 
supply. The dough must in aU cases be thoroughly 
kneaded. Filtered rain water is the best to use 
for bread-making ; if the water be hard, a drachm 
of carbonate of soda may be added to three quarts 
of water, but this is unnecessary when the water 



346 BREAD, ROLLS, BUNS, MUFFINS, ETC. 

is of a soft nature. If rolls are to be made, 
take a portion of the dough and mix it up with 
a few tablespoonfuls of cream, in which the 
whipped whites of two or three eggs have been 
put ; knead them carefully, and add a little flour 
if they be too moist. The dough for rolls should 
be taken o£E when it has risen the second time, as 
above stated, before the fire. After taking the 
dough from the fire the second time, it must be 
kneaded for haK an hour on a board strewed with 
flour, if intended for loaves, but the rolls will not 
require more than five or six minutes kneading. 
They are then to be baked in a quick oven until 
they are nicely browned. A minute or two before 
they are done, they should be taken out of the oven, 
and a brush dipped in the white of egg passed 
over the top ; then they are to be put into the oven 
again for one or two minutes. When there is reason 
to suspect, either from the appearance or smell of 
the flour, that it is not good, and there is still a 
necessity for using it, let it be baked for an hour in 
a very slack oven, and add to it, when making into 
dough, about ten grains of fresh carbonate of am- 
monia, carefully powdered, for every pound of flour. 
This will frequently correct any bad quaUties of the 
flour, and render the bread palatable. Milk may be 
substituted for water in the manufacture of bread, 
but it does not improve the flavour if the flour be 
good. 

887. HOME-MADE BREAD (Middlesex) 

One quartern of best flour, half an ounce of German 
yeast, one teaspoonf ul of salt, one and three-quarter 



BREAD, ROLLS, BUNS, MUFFINS, ETC. 347 

pints of warm water. Mix all into a dough, put 
into a wooden or earthen basin, cover with a thick 
cloth, stand it in a warm corner of the kitchen, let 
it rise for two or three hours. Knead it up well, 
put it in two baking tins, bake in a brisk oven. 



888. HOME-MADE BREAD (Essex) 

Take one and a quarter pounds of flour, two 
ounces of yeast, one saltspoonful of salt, and about 
one pint of milk or more, with a little warm water to 
make the temperature of blood heat. Have a deep 
basin, or better still a small bread-pan, put the flour 
in and pile it all round the sides of the basin to 
make a deep hole in the centre, mix the yeast in a 
cup with a little milk and water till it is nice and 
smooth but not thick. Now pour it into the centre 
of the flour and sprinkle a little flour on the top of 
the yeast, cover the basin with a cloth and put it in 
front of the fire, to rise for about an hour, con- 
tinually turning the basin round. Then mix lightly 
with a wooden spoon so that the yeast is well mixed 
in the flour ; then, with the hand, mix in gradually 
the milk and water, till the dough is nice and light 
but not too moist. Put the basin on a chair and 
knead well with the knuckles tiU the dough looks 
nice and smooth. Butter a tia or tins, put the 
dough in, cover with a cloth and place in front of the 
fire to rise nicely but not too much. Now have a 
nice hot oven ready, put the bread on the lower 
shelf for three-quarters of an hour, and then on 
upper shelf with a greased paper on top of the tins 
for another three-quarters of an hour. Watch it 



348 BREAD, ROLLS, BUNS, MUFFINS, ETC. 

about every twenty minutes, for to open the oven too 
often spoils the bread. 

For making brown bread use wholemeal flour 
instead of the ordinary flour. 

889. CORN BREAD (Ireland) 

To one quart of sifted meal add one teacupf ul of 
cream, three eggs, a teaspoonful of carbonate of soda 
dissolved in water, enough buttermilk to make it quite 
soft ; stir well, and bake in a baking kettle or oven. 

890. ITALIAN BREAD 

Make a stiff dough, with twelve tablespoonfuls of 
fine flour, six of white powdered sugar, three eggs, 
the raspings of a lemon, and two ounces of fresh 
butter ; mix them in a pan with a wooden spoon, and 
if the dough is not sufficiently firm, add more flour 
and sugar. Then turn it out and work it well with 
the hand, cut it into the shape of round long bis- 
cuits, and glaze them with white of egg. They are 
then to be baked in a hot oven. 

891. MANNHEIM BREAD (German) 

Take two eggs, six tablespoonfuls of flour, three 
of sugar, some salt, and a Uttle essence of aniseed to 
give it a flavour ; when worked well together, cut 
into pieces as above, and bake in a quick oven. 

892. POTATO BREAD (French) 

Take the quantity of potatoes required ; boil 
them in their skins. When done, peel them, and 
bruise them with a rolling-pin to the consistence of 



BREAD, ROLLS, BUNS, MUFFINS, ETC. 349 

a paste. To this add as much flour as there is 
potato pulp, and some yeast. Knead them well, 
putting as much water as may be necessary. When 
properly kneaded, form into loaves, and place in the 
oven, taking care that it be not quite so hot as for 
common bread, or it will become hard on the outside 
before the inside is properly baked. The door of the 
oven should not be closed so soon as on ordinary 
occasions. This bread must be allowed longer 
time to bake than any other. 

893. YANKEE BROWN BREAD (Ireland) 

To two quarts of corn meal, pour one quart of 
boiling water ; stir yeast into two quarts of rye meal, 
and knead all together with two quarts of water 
lukewarm. Add, if you choose, one gill of molasses. 

894. LITTLE LOAVES (Kent) 

One quart of flour, one small teaspoonful of soda, 
as much tartaric acid as would fit on a sixpence, 
mixed with either milk or water, a pinch of salt. Mix 
the salt and soda with the flour, then dissolve the 
tartaric acid in the milk, and make your dough. 

895. FRENCH ROLLS 

Two pounds of fine flour, two tablespoonfuls of

rise. Put a bit of butter in a piece of thin muslin, 
tie it up, and rub it lightly on the heated frying 
pan ; then pour over sufficient batter at a time to 
make one crumpet. Let it do slowly, and it will 
be very light. Cook them all the same way. They 
should not be brown but of a fine yellow. 

923. MUFFINS (Middlesex) 
Mix a quartern of fine fiour, one and a half pints

good yeast and a little salt. Stir them together for 
a quarter of an hour, then strain the liquor into a 
quarter of a peck of fine flour ; mix the dough well, 
and set it to rise for an hour. Then roll it up and 
pull into small pieces ; make them up in the hand 
like baUs, and lay a flannel on them while rolling, 
to keep them warm. The dough should be closely 
covered the whole time. When the whole is rolled 
into balls, the flrst that is made will be ready for 
baking. When they are spread out in the right form 
for muffins, lay them on tins and bake them, and as 
the bottoms begin to change colour, turn them on 
the other side.

cakes and bake immediately. 



n 

Take half a peck of flour, half a pint of yeast, one 
pound of currants, one pound of butter, half a pound 
of sugar, one ounce of caraway seeds ; to be made 
into large cakes. Set to rise a short time before 
being put into the oven. 

930. TO MAKE BARM OR YEAST (Cheshire) 

I 
Boil one ounce of hops in six quarts of water till 
the hops fall to the bottom, then strain, and when 
blood-warm, add two tablespoonfuls of sugar and 
three pints of flour. Leave it at the fire two days, 
stirring it frequently — then add one pound of boiled 
potatoes, bruised, and well mixed through the barm. 
Strain all through a colander and set it by the fire 
till it rises in the vessel. Keep it in a cool place 
covered. One pint will answer for eight quarts of 
flour. 

931. ANOTHER WAY. 

A handful of hops to a breakfastcupful of malt. 
Pour four to five quarts of boiling water on it, and 
let it simmer down to about three quarts. Then 
strain, and when milkwarm, add half a pint of flour,

gallons of water. Boil for an hour in a very clean 
pan. Have ready two pounds of fine flour rubbed 
very smooth with cold water in a deep mug (pan). 
Strain the boiling liquid on the flour while some one 
stirs it with a wooden spoon. About one quart of 
old barm should be put to the new while it is warm. 
Let it stand to work for two days and then cork it up 
very tightly. Shake the bottle well before using it ; 
it is better two or three days old. Fourteen pounds 
of flour wiU require two teacupfuls of barm. 



CHAPTER XX 

BEVERAGES 

Note. — In the olden days of home-brewed ale, a 
great many wines and beers were also made. Some 
of these, " tasting of Flora and the country green," 
in rural districts still survive. 

The Surrey cottager regards the elder-bloom in 
the hedges as significant of the coming elderberry 
wine that shall " hearten a man up," as he puts it, 
in a drear-nighted December : elderberry wine and 
Christmas are for him synonymous. CowsUp wine, 
sweet, sticky, and innocuous — rhubarb, and turnip, 
and blackberry wine, are yet immensely popular in 
provincial places : and " currant wine is very good," 
as Jenny Wren said in the nursery rhyme. 

But aerated drinks have largely superseded these 
pleasant beverages ; and the old-time recipes are 
rapidly becoming obsolete. Amongst those ensuing 
I would call attention to the various formulas for 
ginger beer — which is cheap, wholesome, and re- 
freshing — to the home-made cordials and liqueurs, 
and to the notes on coffee and tea-making. It 
should be noted that many cottage wines are 
spoiled by the use of brown sugar, which renders 
them somewhat coarse and crude in flavour. White 
preserving sugar is nowadays just as cheap, and 
much more refined to the taste.

364 BEVEEAGES 

HOME-MADE WINES (ALCOHOLIC) 

933. APPLE WINE (1822) 

To make a wine nearly equal to the Rhenish, you 
must, to every gallon of the juice of apples, im- 
mediately after it comes from the press, add two 
pounds of common loaf sugar. Boil it as long as any 
scum rises ; strain it through a sieve, and let it cool ; 
add some good yeast, and stir it well. Let it work 
in the tub for two or three weeks, or till the head 
begins to flatten, then skim off the head, draw it 
clear off, and turn it. When it has been made a year, 
rack it off, and fine it with isinglass ; then add to 
every three gallons half a pint of the best rectified 
spirits of wine, or one pint of brandy (see note 
to No. 940). This wine wUl be found very superior. 

934. BLACKBERRY WINE (Essex) 

Put any quantity of blackberries in a pan, just 
cover them with boiling water, and allow them to 
stand in a cool oven or outside the cooking-stove 
all night to draw the juice ; or the berries may be 
mashed with a mallet. 

Measure and strain into a cask or stone bottle, 
and allow the juice to ferment for a fortnight. No 
yeast is required. Then add one pound of loaf 
sugar to every gallon of the wine, with a quarter of a 
pint of best brandy (see note, No. 940). It may be 
bottled in six months, but wiU improve by keeping. 

935. BALM WINE (Yorkshire, 1769) 

Put a peck of balm leaves in a tub or large jar, 
beat four gallons of water scalding hot, ready to 



BEVERAGES 365 

boil, then pour it upon the leaves. Let it stand all 
night, then strain it off through a hair sieve. To 
every gallon of liquid put two pounds of fine sugar, 
and stir up very well. Take the whites of four or 
five eggs, beat them very well, put them into a pan 
with the liquor. Whisk it well before it be over 
hot ; when the scum begins to rise take it off, and 
keep it skimmed all the time it is boiling. Let it 
boil three-quarters of an hour ; then put it into the 
tub. When it is cold, put a little new yeast upon it, 
and beat it in, every two hours, that it may head 
the better. So work it for two days, then put it into 
a sweet keg, b;mg it up close, and when it is clear, 
bottle. 



936. COWSLIP WINE (1815) 

To one gallon of water put four pounds of loaf 
sugar, boil and skim it as long as any scum rises ; 
to each gallon of water put the rind of a lemon or 
orange, and boil with the sugar and water three 
gallons of the flowers of cowslips. Let them boil 
three minutes, then put it into a tub, and when 
almost cold, toast a bit of bread and spread it with 
very thick yeast, put it in the liquor, and let it 
stand two nights : when you put it into the cask, 
add all the juice of the orange or lemon which you 
pared ; and if you make ten gallons of wine, you 
must put two quarts of brandy, and so on in pro- 
portion for any quantity you wish to make. (See 
note. No, 940.) 



366 BEVERAGES 

937. COWSLIP WINE (Surrey) 

Boil twelve pounds of loaf sugar, with the juice of 
six Seville oranges, and the whites of three or four 
eggs well beaten, in six gallons of water, for haK an 
hour, carefully skimming it all the time. In the 
meanwhile, put a peck of the finest and freshest 
picked cowslip flowers into a tub, with the rinds 
of two or three of the oranges, and, pouring on them 
the boiling syrup, stir the whole up, and leave it, 
well covered, to infuse. On its getting nearly cold, 
spread a thin toast of bread all over with good yeast, 
and put it into the tub to excite a fermentation. 
After it has worked two or three days, strain it off, 
having first pressed the cowslips in a coarse cloth 
to strain out all the juice. Having turned it up, 
keep the bung loose for a few days, and on finding 
the wine has ceased to work, which is always known 
by its ceasing to hiss, drive the bung tight. Let the 
hquor remain undisturbed for about three months 
and then bottle it off, either for present or future 
use. If, on running the wine, about a quarter of 
a pint of brandy be put in for every gallon (see note. 
No. 940), with a quarter of a gill of syrup of citrons, 
lemons, or clove gilly-flowers, it will make a very fine 
addition to its strength and flavour. (This is the 
best recipe of the three. Ed.) 

938. ANOTHER WAY 

To two gallons of water and half a peck of cowslip 
flowers, add two and a half pounds of powdered 
sugar. Boil them for half an hour, and take off the 
scum as it rises. Then pour it into a tub to cool, 



BEVERAGES 367 

with the rinds of two lemons. Let it stand in the 
tub for two days, stirring it every two or three hours, 
and then put it into a barrel. Let it stand a month ; 
bottle it, and put a lump of loaf sugar in each bottle. 

939. CURRANT WINE (1815) 

To three qua,rts of water add two quarts of currant 
juice and four pounds of good powdered sugar ; let 
it stand two or three days before you put it into the 
cask ; and if you make ten gallons, add three quarts 
of brandy (see note. No. 940), and one gallon of 
raspberry juice mixed with four poimds of sugar. 
Put the bung in, but do not stop it close till it has 
done hissing, which perhaps will not cease in less 
than a fortnight ; then stop it close, and let it stand 
twelve months, if you make a large quantity. N.B. 
— As currant wine is seldom two years alike, on 
account of the different seasons for ripening the 
currants, it will be proper to try the wine in four or 
five months after it is made, as the sweetness goes off 
much sooner some years than others, but it will 
generally require to stand twelve months or more. 
If it is made with loaf sugar, it is fit to drain off much 
sooner ; but the wine is not so strong as that made of 
powdered sugar. The raspberry juice and brandy 
should not be mixed with the wine till it is put into 
the cask. 

940. CURRANT WINE (1822) 

For a fine currant wine, take black currants, red 
currants, white currants, ripe cherries, raspberries, 
and strawberries, of each an equal quantity. To 
every four poimds, well bruised, add one gallon of 



368 BEVERAGES 

clear soft water. Steep three days and nights in 
open vessel, and stir the mass frequently. Then 
strain through a sieve, and press the pulp to dryness. 
To each gallon of liquor put three pounds of good, 
rich moist sugar. Let the whole stand three days, 
skim the top, and stir frequently. Put it into 
casks, to purge at the bung, for about a fortnight ; 
then to every nine gallons you can add a quart 
of good brandy, and close the cask. Isinglass 
finings may be applied, if necessary. 

Note : Some of the finest-flavoured and strongest- 
bodied home-made wines I ever met with, were made 
without any addition whatever of brandy ; and the 
excellence they had attained from age, was a proof 
that brandy was not necessary merely to enable them 
to keep. 

941. CURRANT WINE (Kent) 

To every quart of juice put two quarts of water, 
and to every gallon three and a half pounds of sugar. 
Let it ferment in the cask three days, and then 
bimg it down with a quarter of a pint of brandy to 
each gallon (see note to above, No. 940). 

AU home-made wines are better if you first boil 
the sugar and water together, and add the juice when 
cold. 

Grape wines are made in the same proportion. 

The fruit should be gathered in a dry season and 
when quite ripe. 

942. ELDERBERRY WINE (Essex) 

Remove the berries from the stems and if neces- 
sary wash them. Place in a pan, mash weU, and 



BEVERAGES 369 

pour over boiling water in the proportion of three 
quarts to four quarts of berries. Let them remain 
for twenty-four hours, then strain and press out all 
the juice that can be forced through the strainer. 
For every two quarts of juice add one and three- 
quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, a dozen allspice, an 
inch of ginger root, and a teaspoonful each of cara- 
way seeds and powdered cinnamon. Boil aU to- 
gether for five minutes, and when quite cold, put in 
half an ounce of compressed yeast, which has been 
stirred till liquid with a teaspoonful of sugar. The 
fermentation will commence in a short time, and 
when it is quite finished the wine may be bottled. 
As this wine is rather heady, many people prefer 
to substitute elder syrup, which can be made like 
blackberry syrup, and wiU make a nice hot drink 
for winter evenings. 

943. ELDERBERRY WINE (Surrey) 

Take five gallons of ripe elderberries, and boU 
them in ten quarts of water for half an hour. Then 
strain through a sieve, but do not squeeze the berries. 
Pour back the liquor into the boiler, measuring it. 
To every gallon add three and a half pounds of sugar, 
with the peels and juice of five or six lemons. Boil 
twenty minutes, and when at boiling point, add 
the well-beaten whites of five or six eggs. Stir all 
well, and fill the cask. When the liquor has cooled 
enough, put in some yeast, or a bit of toast with 
yeast on. When it is ready to be bimged, half a 
pound of bruised race ginger, in a muslin bag, should 
be tied so as to hang in the middle of the cask. 
In two months it will be ready to bottle.

944. ELDERBERRY WINE (Sussex) 

Take about twenty pounds of very ripe elderberries 
(picked from the stalks), and put them into a deep 
earthen pan or small tub, with just enough water 
to cover them. Crush them every now and then 
with some heavy utensil, till all the juice is out of 
the berries. Then strain the liquor into a pan for 
boiling, with three pounds of Demerara sugar to 
every gallon of juice. Add some cloves, a stick of 
mace, the same of cinnamon, and six or seven pieces 
good " race " ginger. Let this boU for about one 
and a quarter hours, then pour it back into the 
former vessel (cleaned ready to receive it), and when 
it is fairly cold, put in a little yeast on a bit of toast, 
cover it up and leave it to work. In about five days 
you can strain out the wine into a cask, and leave 
the bunghole half open till fermentation ceases, 
when it must be securely fastened and left so for 
three months. 



945. GINGER WINE (1815) 

To five gallons of water put seven pounds of 
powdered sugar ; boil it a quarter of an hour, take 
the scum off as it rises, put the liquor into a tub, 
and, when cold, add six pounds of sun raisins. Have 
ready five ounces of ginger boiled in two quarts of 
water till it is reduced to one quart, and the peels 
of two large lemons boiled with it ; when it is cold 
put this to the liquor, with two ounces of isinglass. 
Toast a bit of bread, and spread it thick with good 
yeast, and put it in ; let it stand in the tub one 
night, take out the bread and put it into the cask 



BEVERAGES 371 

with a pint of brandy (see note, No. 940) ; stop it close 
and let it stand six weeks, and it will be fit to bottle. 

946. GINGER WINE (Kent, 1809) 

Seven gallons of water, seven pounds of lump 
sugar, half a pound of ginger well bruised ; boU it all 
one hour, then add the whites of four eggs, weU 
beaten to clarify it, and skim it well when boiled ; 
strain it iato a tub, and let it stand till it is quite 
cold, then put into a vessel, with the peels and juice 
of seven lemons out very thin, and two spoonfuls of 
yeast. Stop the cask close. In a fortnight it will 
be fit for bottling, and in a fortnight more for drink- 
ing. N.B. — The juice of the lemons should be passed 
through a colander, or strainer, and the egg-sheUs 
be boiled in it. 

947. GOOSEBERRY WINE (1822) 

To every two gallons of full-ripe gooseberries, 
mashed, add an equal quantity of soft water, milk- 
warm, and one pound of refined sugar, in process of 
dissolving. Stir up the whole in a tub, and cover 
with a blanket, to preserve the heat of fermentation. 
Stir frequently for three days, then strain — first 
through a sieve, and secondly through a coarse 
cloth. The liquor must then be put into a cask, 
kept full, and allowed to ferment from ten days to 
three weeks, when two or three bottles of brandy 
(see note, No. 940), according to the size of the 
cask, in the proportion of one to eight, may be 
poured in, with the same quantity of sherry, 
together with a small quantity of isinglass, perfectly 
dissolved in water. Close the cask tightly, and if 



372 BEVERAGES 

at the end of a fortnight it is not sweet enough, 
add more sugar. Close finally for six months, and 
then bottle ; or sooner, if it is wished to imitate 
sparkling champagne. 

948. GREEN GOOSEBERRY WINE (Lancashire) 

Gather gooseberries when quite hard and sour. 
To every pound of fruit when picked and bruised 
put one quart of cold spring water. Let it stand 
three days, stirring it twice every day. To every 
gallon of juice, when strained, add three pounds of 
loaf sugar. Put it in a brandy cask and to every 
twenty quarts of the liquor add one quart of French 
brandy (see note, No. 940), and a little isinglass. 
Try it in six months, and if the sweetness is gone off, 
bottle it. The corks should be wired down. 

949. ANOTHER WAY 

To one pound of bruised gooseberries, add one 
quart of spring water. Let it stand two days and 
then strain it off. To every gallon of liquor add three 
pounds of loaf sugar ; when that is dissolved, barrel 
it When the fermentation has subsided, to every 
five gallons add one pint of brandy (see note, No. 
940), and a little isinglass. Let it stand six months, 
then bottle it. 

950. GRAPE WINE (Kent) 

To every gallon of water put four quarts of grapes 
well bruised. Let it stand twenty-four hours, then 
strain it through a hair sieve. To every gallon of 
liquor put three pounds of loaf sugar ; when the 



BEVERAGES 373 

Bugar is dissolved, put it into a cask, which must be 
quite full, then add a quarter of an ounce of isinglass 
to every five gallons, stirring it weU with a stick. 
Take off the scum, which rises for several days, and 
when the liquor is clear, stop up the cask very close, 
and bottle it in March (September in Australia). 



951. LEMON WINE (Kent, 1809) 

Take a sufficient number of the best lemons to 
produce five quarts of juice, and pass the liquid 
through a strainer to free it entirely from the seeds. 
Peel all the lemons before squeezing, throw the pulps 
into a large tub, and cover them with water. When 
they have been steeped for two days, strain off 
the liquid, and pour it on seventy-five pounds of 
lump sugar, to which, when formed into a syrup, 
add as much of lemon peel as you obtain by 
putting half of the rinds, cut very thin, into a jug, 
and pouring on them about two quarts of boiling 
water, which, after being covered over for two days 
and nights will have sufficiently imbibed the flavour. 
Gret a cask of twenty-one gallons measure (if one 
that has held brandy, sherry, or Madeira, it will be 
better), pour into it the juice of the fruit and the 
syrup mixture, and fill the cask up with water ; leave 
the bung out for about six weeks, or even two 
months, and by that time it will have sufficiently 
fermented, but should there be the least hissing or 
the smallest quantity rising out of the bung hole, 
you must not stop it down ; the vent peg, for security, 
had better be left out for a few days. The wine 
must remain two years in the cask before it is bottled. 
Rainwater or Thames water is much to be preferred in 



374 BEVERAGES 

making the wine. It is all to be used cold, excepting 
that put to the rinds, and nothing is to be used to 
produce fermentation. If you should wish to bottle 
the wine before the expiration of two years, it may 
be done at the end of twelve months, but not sooner, 
by fining it down with isinglass. N.B. — ^At the 
expiration of a fortnight add two bottles of brandy 
(see note. No. 940) ; should the fermentation not 
have ceased in four days after adding the above, 
put in one bottle more brandy. 

952. LEMON WINE (1815) 

Pare four dozen of lemons, put the peels into one 
gallon of brandy, and let them stand fourteen days ; 
make the juice of the lemons into a syrup, with two 
pounds of lump sugar ; when the peels are ready, 
boil ten gallons of water with forty pounds of good 
lump sugar, for half an hour ; put it into a tub, and, 
when cold, add the brandy, peel, and syrup, and put 
it into the cask ; stop it close, and let it stand six 
months. N.B. — Beat the whites of six eggs to a 
froth, and mix with the water while it is cold. 

953. MADEIRA WINE (Kent, 1809) 

Thirty poimds of coarse, moist sugar, to ten gallons 
of water ; boil it half an hour, and take off the scum 
as it rises ; when cold, put to every gallon one quart 
of ale out of the vat, let it work well a couple of days, 
then put it ki a barrel with one pound of sugar-candy 
and four pounds of raisins, with some isinglass in 
a pint of brandy (see note, No. 940). When it has 
done working, stop it up close and let it stand twelve 
months. October is the best month for making it.

954. MARIGOLD WINE (Surrey) 
Take a peck of marigold blossoms, stand them 
ill an earthenware pan, with one and a half pounds 
of stoned raisins. To three gallons of water, add 
two pounds of honey and seven pounds of sugar. 
Boil this, clear it with the whites and shells of three 
eggs, strain it, and put it to the flowers. Cover the 
pan close and leave it for twenty-four hours ; then, 
next day, stir it up with a wooden spoon, and let it 
stand another twenty-four hours. Then strain it 
off into a cask, adding the thinly pared rinds of five 
or six oranges, a pound of sugar-candy, and about 
a wineglassful of brewer's yeast. Stir well, and 
leave it to work until it foams out at the covered 
bunghole. When fermentation is over, add one 
pint of brandy and about half an ounce of isinglass 
(melted), and stop up the cask (see note, No. 940). 
In four or five months' time it should be ready. 

955. MEAD (1815) 
To one gallon of water put five poimds of honey ; 
when the water is hot put the honey into it, and let 
it boil one hour and a half ; as soon as the scum 
begins to rise take it off, and continue skimming it 
as long as any scum arises ; then put two ounces of 
hops to every ten gallons of liquor, and two ounces 
of coriander seeds, each ounce sewn up in a separate 
bag ; add the rind of three or four lemons and oranges, 
if you like : when it is cool, put it into the cask with 
a bottle of brandy (see note. No. 940), and stop it up 
quite close. Mead made of this strength will generally 
require to stand six or nine months in the barrel ; 
if you wish to have the sweetness gone off, it must 
stand longer.

956. MEAD (Middlesex) 

Put into a large earthenware pan three gallons 
of water, five pounds of honey, half an ounce each of 
cinnamon, mace, and ground ginger ; four cloves, 
and the whites of two eggs well beaten. Mix all tho- 
roughly weU. Pour it into a deep lined saucepan, or 
large preserving pan, and stir it gently till it comes 
to the boil, then let it simmer for at least an hour. 
Take it ofE and let it go cold. Then stir in one table- 
spoonful of brewer's yeast, and strain it off into a 
cask to ferment. Keep the bunghole covered tUl 
fermentation ceases, then close it up and leave it 
for nine months or so, after which the wine can be 
bottled. 

957. MEAD (Surrey) 

Boil fourteen pounds of honey in six gallons of 
water for half an hour, breaking into it four eggs. 
Add some small bunches of marjoram, balm, and 
sweet briar, half an ounce each of cinnamon, cloves, 
mace, and bruised ginger, and boil for quarter of an 
hour longer. Pour it out to cool, toast a large slice 
of brown bread, spread it over with fresh yeast, and 
put it into the liquor. Let it ferment for one day, 
and then put it into a cask, which keep open tiU 
fermentation has ceased, then bung close. It may 
be bottled in a month, but the corks must be weU 
wired. 

958. METHEGLIN (Cornwall) 

Take three and a half pounds of honey, one quart 
of white-currant juice, two gallons of boiling water, 



BEVERAGES 377 

quarter of an ounce of cream of tartar, and stir all 
well together till the honey is quite dissolved. Then 
let it stand to ferment. When fermentation ceases, 
strain it off, add one pint of brandy (see note. 
No. 940), and bottle it. If it be properly corked and 
kept in a dry place, it will keep good for years. 

959. ORANGE WINE (1815) 
To thirty quarts of water, add forty pounds of 
lump sugar, and the whites of six eggs ; beat them 
to a froth, and mix it with the water while it is cold ; 
boil it half an hour, and take off the scum as it rises. 
Have ready ten quarts of the juice of Seville oranges, 
and put half the rinds into a tub, and pour the 
liqour boiling hot upon them ; let it stand till quite 
cold, and add the juice and a quart of brandy (see 
note, No. 940) ; put it in the cask and stop it close, 
and let it stand for six months, and if it is too sweet 
let it stand longer. If you wish to have it very rich, 
you may add what quantity you please of citron 
syrup. Wine made by this recipe is very rich with- 
out the syrup. 

960. RAISIN WINE (1815) 
To one gallon of water put six pounds of sun 
raisins ; let it stand in a tub twelve days, stir it 
frequently, press the raisins as dry as possible, and 
put the liquor into a cask the proper size ; if you 
have ten gallons, put a quart of brandy in it (see 
note. No. 940). If you wish to make it very rich, 
you may put seven pounds of raisins to the gallon, 
and dissolve five pounds of sugar-candy in the liquor 
before you put it into the barrel : when made thus, it 
requires to stand longer, and is equal to any foreign 
wine.

961. RHUBARB WINE (Suffolk) 

Measure one pint of rhubarb, cut into small 
pieces, to one pint of water, to the quantity you 
require. Put all together into an earthen vessel

(with a wooden spoon) every morning. Then strain 
o£f, and measure half a pound of white sugar to 
every pint of liquid. Let this stand for a week ; 
skim every morning, and bottle at the end of the 
week. 

962. ENGLISH SHERRY (Kent, 1809) 

Thirty poimds of moist Lisbon sugar to ten gallons 
of water. Boil it half an hour, then skim it clean. 
When quite cold, put to every gallon of the liquor 
one quart of new ale out of the butt. Let it work in 
the tub a day or two ; then put it in the barrel 
with one pound of brown sugar-candy, six pounds of 
common raisins, one pint of French brandy, and two 
ounces of isinglass. When it has done working, stop 
it up. It should remain in the vessel two years, if 
not particularly wanted.

BEERS (NON-ALCOHOLIC) 

964. GINGER BEER (1822) 

Ginger beer of a very superior quality may be 
prepared as follows : Powder of ginger, one ounce, 
cream of tartar, half an ounce, a large lemon shced, 
two pounds of lump sugar and one gallon of water 
added together, and simmered over the fire for half 
an hour. Then ferment it in the usual way with a 
tablespoonful of yeast, and bottle it for use, tightly 
corked. 

965. GINGER BEER (Kent) 

Bruise two ounces of the best ginger, two ounces 
of cream of tartar, four lemons pared and sUced, with 
the rind of one, and two pounds of loaf sugar. Pour 
upon them two gallons of boiling water. When 
nearly cold, strain through flannel, and add two 
large spoonfuls of yeast. Let it stand till quite 
cold, and pour off the clear liquor into half-pint 
bottles, which must be well corked and tied down. 
It will be fit to drink in three or four days.

966. ANOTHER WAY 

Pour one gallon of boiling water over three- 
quarters of a pound of lump sugar, one and a half 
ounces of bruised ginger, and the peel of a lemon — 
when milk-warm add one tablespoonful of yeast. 
If this be done at night, it will be fit for bottling next 
night. Put the piece of lemon into the yeast. Not 
to be used for three days. 



967. GINGER BEER (Middlesex) 

A very pleasant and wholesome beverage when 
well made. It was first invented a great many 
years ago by a Mr. Pitt, a surgeon at Lewes, and 
rose rapidly into fame. ^ Even when made as it 
ought to be, it is a cheap beverage, but as it is 
usually made, it is still cheaper, tartaric acid being 
used instead of lemon juice. The best way of 
making ginger beer is as follows : — Pour eleven 
gallons of boiling water upon fourteen pounds of 
white sugar, the juice of eighteen lemons, a pound 
of bruised ginger, and the rind of two lemons. 
When at the proper temperature, add two or three 
spoonfuls of yeast and let it ferment for about a 
day ; then put it into a cask to finish the fermenta- 
tion, and when that is completed, fine it and bung 
it down closely. It may be bottled in stone bottles 
almost immediately. Some persons boil the water 
and sugar together before it is poured upon the 
ginger, but this trouble is unnecessary, unless it be 
intended to add raisins, which are a great improve- 
ment. In that case, a pound of good raisins may 
be boiled with the water and sugar. The quantity 



BEVERAGES 381 

of ginger above ordered is rather larger than would 
suit every taste. It may of course be reduced. 
In bottling, good corks should be used, and tied 
over with twine. 

968. GINGER BEER (Stafiordshire) 

Mix one ounce of powdered ginger, half an ounce 
of cream of tartar, one lemon sliced, two pounds of 
lump sugar, and one gallon of water together. 
Simmer it over the fire for half an hour, and ferment 
it in the usual manner with a tablespoonful of yeast. 
Then bottle it close for use in half-pint or pint 
bottles, such as are used for soda water ; in a few 
days it will be fit to drink. 

969. GINGER BEER (Sussex) 

Four gallons of water, two ounces of groimd 
ginger, two ounces of cream of tartar, two and a 
half pounds of moist sugar. Pour half the boiling 
water on these ingredients, except the sugar. Let 
it stand a day or two, then add the remainder of the 
water, boiling also, and the sugar, and a teacupful 
of yeast. Bottle it when rather warm. 

970. GINGER POP (Ireland) 

Take two ounces of cream of tartar, one ounce and 
a half of white ginger well beaten (not ground), one 
lemon shredded fine, one pound and a half of sugar. 
Put them all together in an earthen vessel, and pour 
on them ten quarts of boiling water. Let it stand 
till nearly cold, then add two tablespoonfuls of 
good barm ; mix it well ; let it stand for thirty 



382 BEVERAGES 

hours, then strain it through a flannel bag, pressing 
it well through. Bottle it, and confine the corks 
with twine. It will be fit for use in two days. 



971. IMPERIAL POP (Kent, 1809) 

To two gallons of boiling hot water add two 
pounds of loaf sugar, two ounces of white bruised 
ginger, one ounce of cream of tartar and two table- 
spoonfuls of yeast. When it is blood warm, put in 
the yeast. Do not bottle it until quite cold and 
clear. This quantity will fill ten bottles. Tie down 
the corks. It will be fit to drink in one week in 
the summer. 



972. NETTLE BEER (Hampshire) 

Wash the nettles (which should be young and 
green), and boil them for about three hours, with a 
little race ginger. When cool enough, add about 
one pound of sugar to every two gallons of liquor, 
and add about a permyworth of .yeast to the same 
quantity. After it has worked a few hours, skim 
and bottle it. 



973. NETTLE BEER (Surrey) 

Boil two quarts of nettle sprouts in one gallon of 
water. Strain the liquor, and add half a pound of 
sugar, with a teaspoonful of ginger. When nearly 
cold, ferment with yeast, and bottle securely while 
in a state of effervescence. It will be ready for 
use in a few days. 



BEVEEAGES 383 

974. ANOTHER WAY 

Into a saucepan or kettle that will hold three 
gallons, put two gallons of water. When this is 
boiling, add as many nettles as the saucepan will con- 
tain. Boil them for half an hour, and strain into 
an earthenware pan broader at the top than at the 
bottom. Make up, with hot water, the quantity of 
liquor to four gallons. While it is stiU as hot as 
possible, add two ounces of best raw ginger, well 
bruised, one ounce of cream of tartar, the peel of 
three lemons cut thin, also their squeezed juice, 
and two pounds of white sugar. Let the liquor 
stand, stirring it occasionally, until lukewarm, when 
add two pennyworth of brewer's yeast. While the 
liquor is hot, a little isinglass may be used to fine 
it. Stir well, and let it stand in a cool place all 
night. In the morning, all impurities, etc., wiU 
have risen to the top ; skim very carefully and 
bottle in champagne bottles. The corks cannot be 
too good ; bad corks wiQ destroy the whole thing. 
If the corks are boiled in water for a couple of 
hours before they are used (hot), they will drive 
much easier and cork much more perfectly. They 
must be tied down as soon as corked. If the 
value of this beverage were generally known, no 
household would be without it. 

975. TREACLE BEER (1822) 

This is a very pleasant and wholesome beverage. 
To a quarter of a peck of sweet wheat bran, add 
three handfuls of hops, and ten gallons of water. 
Boil the whole together in a copper saucepan, tiU 
the bran and hops sink to the bottom. Then strain 



384 BEVERAGES 

it through a hair sieve into a cooler, and when luke- 
warm add two quarts of treacle (or three pints if 
it be very thick). This will be sufficient for a nine- 
gallon cask. Before you pour the liquor into the 
barrel, which must be done as soon as the treacle 
is melted, put two tablespoonfuls of good yeast 
into the barrel. When the fermentation has sub- 
sided, bung the cask up close, and in four days it 
will be fit to use. If you choose to bottle any of 
the beer, it will be much improved by so doing, 
and will be ready to drink in six or seven days. 



LEMONADE, SYRUPS, FRUIT VINEGARS, 
ETC. 

976. BLACKBERRY SYRUP (Essex) 

Stew the blackberries with a quarter of a pint 
of water to every three pounds, until the juice is 
drawn. Strain, and to every pint of juice add six 
ounces of sugar. Boil sugar and juice together for 
fifteen minutes, and bottle for use when cold. 



977. BLACKBERRY VINEGAR (Surrey) 

Take three quarts of ripe blackberries, crush 
them, and pour over them two quarts of the best 
white vinegar. Let it stand twenty-four hours, then 
strain it off through a piece of muslin, and pour the 
fluid on to three quarts of fresh blackberries. Let 
it stand as before ; and if not strong enough when 
you strain it off the second time, pour it on to 
three quarts of fresh berries again. When rich 
enough, put it into a jar, and stand the jar in a 



BEVERAGES 383 

pan of boiling water. Let it boil fast for an hour, 
then bottle for use. This is very good for colds, 
etc., diluted with hot or cold water. 

978. CHERRY WATER 

Take one pound of good cherries, pound them in a 
mortar till the kernels are broken, put them in a 
large bowl and add four gills of thick syrup. Put to 
this the juice of four lemons, and some water, enough 
to thin the liquid sufficiently. Then strain off 
through a sieve into glass jugs. 

979. COWSLIP SYRUP (Surrey) 

Take twelve ounces of fresh cowslip flowers, one 
pint of boiling water. Infuse twenty-four hours, 
strain, and then add two pounds of white sugar. BoU 
it gently until it attains the consistence of a syrup. 

980. ELDER ROB (Eighteenth Century) 

Gather your elderberries full ripe, pick them clean 
from the stalks, put them in large stew-jars and tie 
paper over them. Let them stand two hours in a 
moderate oven. Then put them in a thin, coarse 
cloth, and squeeze out all the juice you can get. 
Put eight quarts into a preserving pan, set it over a 
slow fire, let it boil till it be reduced to one quart. 
When it is near done, keep stirring it, to prevent it 
burning. Then put it into pots, let it stand two or 
three days in the sun ; then dip a paper, the size of 
your pot, LQ sweet oil, lay it on, tie it down with a 
bladder, and keep it in a very dry place. Black 
Currant Rob is made the same way, but six quarts 
25 



386 BEVERAGES 

of juice will suffice. (These are excellent, diluted 
with water, for use in feverish colds.) 

981. FLUMMERY (Ireland) 

To one quart of oatmeal pour one gallon of water 
and a pint of buttermilk ; let it remain for four 
days, then strain through a hair sieve. Two quarts 
more of water may be put on the oatmeal, and let 
stand four days longer ; it will be sufficiently sour 
without buttermilk the second time. 

982. FRUIT SYRUP (French) 

Put the fruit into a pan and let it boil five minutes. 
Then squeeze out the juice and strain it through a 
jelly-bag. Add it to a S3?rup of sugar, in the pro- 
portion of half a pound of juice to one pound of sugar. 
For this purpose your syrup must be very good, the 
water being evaporated by boiling until the syrup 
be very thick. When the juice and syrup are 
thoroughly mixed, strain again through a jelly-bag. 

983. GINGERETTE (Sussex) 

Three drachms of tincture of cayenne, four 
drachms of essence of ginger, three-quarters of an 
ounce of either tartaric or citric acid, four pounds of 
loaf sugar. Pour three quarts of boiling water on to 
these ingredients. When cold, add about fifteen 
drops of essence of lemon, and bottle.

Take five pints of freshly-gathered clove gilli- 
flowers, and put to them two pints of boiling water, 
then put them in an earthen pot to infuse a night 
and a day. Take a strainer and strain them out ; 
to a quart of your liquor, put one and a half pounds 
of loaf sugar ; boil it over a slow fire, and skim it 
while any scum rises. When it is cold, bottle it

stir it ia with a sUver spoon. When cold, bottle it. 

989. LEMON SYRUP (Essex) 

Put twelve ounces of loaf sugar into one quart of 
water, and let it boil for fifteen minutes, skimming it 
carefully. Take it off and let it get cold, then add 
half a pint of strained lemon-juice, and one drachm 
of essence of lemon. Mix well and bottle it. Cork 
very tightly. To be used with water or soda-water. 

990. LEMON SYRUP (Kent, 1809) 

To every pint of lemon juice add one pound or 
rather more of good loaf sugar, skim it well while 
simmering. When all the dross is removed, boil it 
briskly for half an hour ; when cold, bottle it. 
Put into each bottle a very few thin shces of lemon 
peel, which must be boiled soft in the syrup. 

991. RASPBERRY VINEGAR (1816) 

Take six pounds of raspberries, gathered in dry 
weather, and six pounds of pounded sugar; put 
them Lq an earthen pan, placing a layer of rasp- 
berries, then a layer of sugar, and so on ; let them 
stand for three days, and stir them once a day 
with a wooden spoon ; then take three pints of 
Burgundy vinegar, put it to them, stir them 
well together, put them into a clean preserving 
pan, over a charcoal fire, make them boUing 
hot, then nm them through a jelly bag. Put the 



BEVERAGES 389 

syrup in a clean earthen pot ; then put a large 
pan of water on the fire, put the pot with the 
syrup in the boiliag water, and let it boil for two 
hours ; if not sweet enough, sweeten it to your 
palate with fine loaf sugar ; let it stand till cold, and 
put it into dry pint bottles. 

992. RASPBERRY VINEGAR (Surrey) 

Bruise two quarts of fresh raspberries, and pour 
over them a quart of good white wiae vinegar; 
cover closely, and let it stand for four days, stirring 
it occasionally ; strain through a flannel bag without 
pressing, and boil the liquor for a quarter of an hour, 
with powdered sugar in the proportion of a pound 
to a pint, skimming carefully ; when cold, bottle 
and cork. If it is intended that the viaegar shall 
be very acid, less sugar must be used. Some per- 
sons add a little brandy when it is bottled ; this is 
good for keeping, but it injures the flavour. 

993. RASPBERRY SHRUB (Surrey) 

Take two quarts of good ripe raspberries, pour 
one quart of good vinegar over them ; cover them 
closely and let them stand for two days. Then mash 
up the berries in the vinegar, and strain off the 
liquid on to two quarts of fresh fruit. Let this 
stand another two days, then mash and strain as 
before. To every pint of liquid, add two teacupfuls 
of white sugar. Let it simmer very gently for 
fifteen minutes in a lined saucepan over the fire, 
keeping it well skimmed. Then strain it, bottle it, 
cork, and cover closely, seal the cork. This should 
be taken with cold water.

ingredients. 

VARIOUS MIXED BEVERAGES (ALCOHOLIC) 

995. ALE SYLLABUB (American) 

Put a quart of strong ale into a large bowl, add 
sugar to taste, and a little nutmeg. Milk the cow 
into the bowl, as quickly and strongly as possible 
to make a good froth ; let it stand for an hour before 
drinking. 

996. BISHOP (Middlesex) 
Roast four good-sized bitter oranges till they are 
of a pale brown colour, lay them in a tureen, and 
put over them half a pound of pounded loaf sugar, 
and three glasses of claret ; place the cover on the 
tureen and let it stand tiU the next day. When 
required for use, put the tureen into a pan of boiling 
water, press the oranges with a spoon, and run the 
juice through a sieve ; then boil the remainder of 
the bottle of claret, taking care that it does not 
bum ; add it to the strained juice, and serve it 
warm in glasses. Port wine wUl answer the purpose 
as well as claret. 

997. BISHOP (Surrey) 
Stick twelve cloves into a lemon (not right through 
the rind) and put it in the oven for half an hour. 



BEVERAGES 391 

Put a good-sized pinch of mixed spice into half a 
pint of water, and boil it. Boil separately one and 
a half pints of sherry, add the lemon and the spiced 
water to this, stand it in a very warm place for a few 
minutes. Take another lemon, rub two ounces of 
lump sugar on the rind, and squeeze out half of the 
juice ; add these to the rest, and serve up very hot. 

998. CLARET CUP (Cheshire) 

Two bottles of Bordeaux, one bottle of soda-water, 
powdered sugar to taste, peel of a lemon cut fine, a 
wineglassful of rum or cura9ao, and a sprig of 
borage. To be well iced. 

999. ANOTHER WAY 

Take a large jug, put into it a lemon and half 
a cucumber (about four inches of it), cut in slices, 
without paring them ; pour in one bottle of claret, 
two bottles of soda-water, one gill of sherry. Add 
a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, and a sprig of 
borage. Cover it up for an hour, then strain out 
the lemon, cucumber, and borage. 

1000. EGG FLIP (American) 

Put one quart of ale into a lined saucepan ; beat 
up in a bowl the yolks of four eggs and the whites of 
two. Mix in four tablespoonfuls of brown sugar, 
and a Httle nutmeg. When the ale boils, pour it 
gently into the egg, so that it shall not curdle. 
Pour it to and fro and back and forward with the 
hand raised high, so that it shall look frothy and 
fleecy. 



392 BEVERAGES 



1001. EGG FLIP (Cheshire) 

Heat one quart of ale to boiling point. Beat up 
to a froth, separately, the yolks of four eggs, and the 
whites of two. Mix them, by degrees, with six 
ounces of powdered sugar, and half a nutmeg, 
grated. Pour the mixture rapidly from one jug to 
another, hot ale and all together, raising the jug to 
a height that will froth the liquid and continue till 
it is smooth and foaming. Serve hot. Sherry may 
be used instead of ale ; in which case, a little lemon 
peel is an improvement. 



1002. EGG HOT (Middlesex) 

A very agreeable posset, taken in many parts of 
England after great fatigue, and not infrequently as 
a remedy for colds ; in which case, however, it is 
not to be recommended, as it increases feverishness 
and fails to promote copious perspiration. Beat up 
the yolks of three eggs and the white of one in a 
teacup of weak ale, with a httle nutmeg ; in the 
meantime have upon the fire a quart of the same 
kind of ale. When it has nearly boiled, add the 
eggs thus beaten up, and let the boiling finish 
very gently, stirring the whole time ; when it has 
thickened, pour it into a jug containing about 
a quartern of brandy and three ounces of loaf 
sugar. Have another jug handy and pour back- 
wards and forwards for three or four minutes before 
serving. White French wine mixed with about a 
third of water may be substituted for the beer. 



BEVERAGES 393 



1003. MINT JTJLEP (American) 

Put into a tumbler about one dozen sprigs of the 
tender shoots of mint, put upon them a spoonful of 
white sugar, and equal proportions of peach brandy 
and common brandy, so as to fill up the glass one- 
third, or perhaps a little less. Then take rasped or 
pounded ice and fiU up the tumbler. (The lips of it 
should be rubbed with a piece of fresh pineapple, 
but this is not absolutely necessary.) As the ice 
melts, you drink. 



1004. MULLED WINE (Middlesex) 

Boil in a quarter of a pint of water, for about ten 
minutes, three cloves, a bit of cinnamon, a little fresh 
lemon peel, and one ounce and a half of loaf sugar ; 
skim, and then add a pint of port wine ; when the 
whole begins to boil, take it off, strain it, and grate 
in some nutmeg ; serve with toasted bread. French 
red wine may be used, but in that case more sugar 
will be necessary. 

1005. MULLED WINE (Surrey) 

Break nine eggs, the yolks and whites separately, 
and beat them separately, adding three or four 
spoonfuls of sugar. Pour a bottle of good wine into 
a skillet, with half a pint of water ; and when it 
boils, put the yolks and whites together, beating 
them well, with half a pint more water, and pour 
them to the wine in the skillet, stirring quickly as 
you pour. When all is thoroughly blended, turn 
out the liquor into a hot jug (earthenware for 



394 BEVERAGES 

preference) and grate some nutmeg in it. To be 
served very hot. 

1006. NEGUS (Surrey) 

Put half a pint of port (or sherry if preferred) in a 
saucepan, and let it heat without boiling. Put 
into a jug or basin four thin slices of lemon, a little 
nutmeg, and six or seven lumps of sugar. Put 
half a pint of boiling water on this, and stir well 
with a wooden or silver spoon until the sugar is 
melted. Then pour in the hot wine ; cinnamon, 
cloves, or allspice may be added at pleasure. 

1007. A RESTORATIVE (Sussex) 

Put two quite fresh eggs, without breaking the 
shells, into a basin ; squeeze over them the juice of 
two or three lemons, cover close and leave them, 
three or four days, till almost dissolved. Then beat 
them well together, strain, put into a bottle, add 
one pint of good rum, half a pound of sugar candy, 
two tablespoonfuls of best salad oil, and shake well 
together. Dose : half a wineglassful in a little cold 
water, fasting. The best time to take it is quite 
early in the morning, say five o'clock, and then 
go to sleep again. 

1008. WHITE WINE WHEY (Eighteenth Century) 

Put one pint of skimmed milk, and half a pint of 
white wine, into a basin ; let it stand a few minutes, 
then pour over it one piut of boiling water. Let 
it stand a little, and the curd will gather in a lump, 
and settle to the bottom. Then pour off your whey 



BEVERAGES 395 

into a china bowl, and put in a lump of sugar, and 
a sprig of balm or a slice of lemon. 



COFFEE AND TEA 

1009. COFFEE (Surrey) 

To make really good coffee, four things are 
essential. (1) Let the coffee be freshly groimd, and, 
if possible, freshly roasted. (2) Do not stint the 
amount : weak coffee is unendurable. (3) Let the 
water be boiling hot, and the utensils thoroughly 
heated. (4) Use only earthenware and wooden 
utensils : let no metal approach the coffee. 

Have ready two earthenware jugs (size at least 
one and a half pints each), well heated. Into the 
first, measure four wooden tablespoonfuls, or not less 
than two and a half oimces to the quart, of freshly 
ground coffee. FUl up with boUing water, stir it 
with the spoon, cover, and leave the jug to stand in 
a warm place for two or three minutes. Then stir 
it thoroughly once more, let the grounds settle again, 
and strain it off through a piece of butter-musUn 
into the hot second jug, and serve at once, with a 
jug of boiling mUk. Should any coffee be left over, 
boil it up along with the mUk the second day. This 
makes it particularly bland and palatable, and 
for those who prefer " French " coffee, i.e. mixed 
with chicory, it is especially advisable. Any well- 
known good brand of the latter, such as the " Red, 
White, and Blue," can be used with success according 
to above directions. Between the result of the 
above, and the ordinary wish-wash served as coffee, 
the difference is too great to be expressed.

1010. TEA rOR A HEADACHE (Surrey) 

This is a special remedial tea, an expensive one, 
and not for ordinary use : but it will cure, or amelior- 
ate, in most oases, the nervous headaches which 
othervidse yield to nothing. 

Take half a pound of a good Congou blend, about 
2s. 2d. or 2s. Qd. per pound, such as Ridgway's, 
two ounces of a good China Tea, not less than 3s. 
per pound, and one ounce of a good green tea, about 
4s. &d. per pound. Blend these thoroughly well 
and keep in a closed tin in a dry place. Do not 
entrust the making of this (or any other tea) to 
servants. The " scalding " of the teapot and 
making of tea with freshly boiling water are 
essential : and this is just what servants usually 
ignore. Water that has been boiling some time 
will not " draw " tea properly : much less so, water 
that " has boUed," which is too frequently made 
use of. 

LIQUEURS, CORDIALS, RATAFIAS 

Note. — Those quiet days being long since past, 
when every well-to-do household possessed a still- 
room or at least a still, the art of making cordials 
and liqueurs, so precious to our predecessors, is in 
danger of being lost for ever. Yet these things are 
so infinitely preferable, both for health's sake and 
economy's sake, to the foreign manufactured article, 
that I cannot shut out a few good old recipes. Not 
all of them, it will be seen, require a process of dis- 
tillation ; and in some cases mere filtering through 
a flannel bag suffices. It is particularly difficult to 
make a hard-and-fast definition of (A) liqueurs, (B) 



BEVERAGES 397 

cordials, and (C) ratafias. Roughly speaking, one 
may say that (A) Liqueurs are mostly prepared by 
distillation ; the dry ingredients having to be 
ground to dust, pestled to a paste, or chopped to 
minute fragments, and then steeped ia spirit for a 
month, before proceediag with the individual 
formula. (B) Cordials are usually not so strong nor 
so spirituous as liqueurs : they may be prepared 
by distillation, but are generally infused. The 
noyeaus in the following pages may be classed as 
cordials. As for (C) Ratafias, they are, correctly 
speaking, non-alcoholic infusions of fruit, sweet and 
syrupy. But the three terms are more or less 
interchangeable, so that it is hard to say where one 
begins and another ends. Some twenty years ago 
it was declared that " there are very few liqueurs 
which are not as good when made by infusion as 
they would be by the more tedious process of dis- 
tillation." Distillation, indeed, is only necessary 
where the flavouring substance, in the form of 
essential oil, has a deteriorated flavour. There 
is certainly no reason or excuse for paying fancy 
prices, when these excellent Uquids can be produced 
at home with perfect ease. They are invaluable 
for flavouring purposes, when not required for 
beverages. 

The Aqiia Vitce Composita prescription is given 
chiefly as a curiosity ; but a modification of it, 
usin^ spirit instead of wine, might conceivably 
result in a cordial of singular efiicacy. 

1011. ALKERMES (French) 
Pound one drachm of cardamom seeds, one 
drachm of nutmegs, two drachms of cinnamon. 



398 BEVERAGES 

Infuse in spirit for a week, then strain and filter.

any other liqueur. Colour it rose with cochineal. 

1012. ANISEED (1815) 

For four bottles of brandy, take half a pound of 
aniseeds, a quarter of a pound of fennel, and three 
cloves, to be cut in small bits, with a little salt ; 
put all in the brandy ; it is to be infused twelve 
hours before you distil it ; two pounds of sugar 
must be clarified, with the whites of two or three 
eggs well beaten together, and two bottles and a 
half of water, and added to the rest. 

1013. ANISETTE (French) 

Take five pints of good spirits of wine, add one 
and a half drachms of essence (or oil) of aniseed, 
eight drops of oil of cinnamon, and then add syrup 
in usual proportion. 

1014. ANGELICA RATAFIA (Surrey) 

Put half a pound of angeHca shoots into two 
quarts of brandy, with a pint of water, two pounds 
of sugar, a few cloves, and a little cinnamon. Let

then strain and bottle. This is a very rich and fine 
cordial. 

1016. APRICOT RATAFIA (Middlesex) 

Cut thirty apricots into small pieces ; crack the 
stones and take out the kernels, which must be 
peeled and bruised ; then put the whole together 



BEVERAGES 399

pound of sugar, a little cinnamon, eight cloves, a 
very small quantity of mace ; close the jar well, 
and let it remain for three weeks, shaking it fre- 
quently ; then strain it off into bottles, and keep 
ia a cool place. 

1016. AQUA VIT^ COMPOSITA (Sixteenth Century) 

Take one gallon of strong French wine, and of 
sage, mints, red roses, thyme, peUitory, rosemary, 
wild thyme, camomile, lavender, each a handful. 
These herbs shall be stamped all together in a mortar, 
and then put in a clean vessel with a pint of rose- 
water and a quart of Spanish wine, and closely 
stoppered and let to stand so three or four days. 
Then put it into a still and distil it once ; then 
take your distilled water and pour it back upon 
the herbs again into the still, and strew upon it 
these powders following : Cloves and cinnamon, of 
each half an ounce ; orris, one ounce ; a few maces ; 
nutmegs, half an ounce ; a little saffron, musk, spike- 
nard, amber ; and some put camphor in it. Stir all 
well together, and distil it clean off, till it come fat 
lik e oil, then get away the distilled water and let 
it be well kept (in bottles). After that make a 
strong fire and distil oil of what is left, and receive 
it in a phial. ("It is wonderful good," adds the 
old writer.) 

1017. CARAWAY CORDIAL (Surrey) 
Steep one ounce of caraway seeds in one pint of 
brandy for a fortnight, then strain off, and add one 
pint of strong syrup ; mix well, and bottle. Thia 
makes a warm and pleasant cordial.

and all — put one quart of brandy, or good spirit, 
and a pound of lump sugar. Let it stand for three 
weeks, stirring now and then. Strain and bottle. 

1019. CHERRY BRANDY (Middlesex, 1822) 

Stone six pounds of black cherries, pour on them 
four quarts of the best brandy. Bruise the stones 
in a mortar, and put the kernels in with the cherries. 
Cover them close, and let the whole stand for a fort- 
night ; then squeeze them clean from sediment, 
through muslin. Boil two pounds of very white 
sugar to clear syrup ; mix it with the strained 
liquor, and bottle it into clear dry bottles. It may 
be used in two months, and should be kept in a 
cool cellar. 

1020. BLACK CHERRY BRANDY (Yorkshire, 1769) 

Take eight pounds of black cherries, stone them, 
and put them in a gallon of the best brandy and 
cover up all close. Let the cherries steep for a 
month or six weeks, then drain off and bottle it for 
use. You may distil the liquor if you please. 

1021. LISBON CHERRY BOUNCE (Kent, 1809) 

Six pounds of black cherries, four quarts of rum, 
three pounds of loaf sugar, half a pound of bitter 
almonds, a quarter of an ounce of cloves, half a 
drachm of cinnamon. Dissolve the sugar in the 
spirit, then add the . other ingredients, and keep 



BEVERAGES 401 

them in a well-corked jar or bottle for six months, 
occasionally shaking the mixture. The fruit is to 
be strained, and two ounces of gum arable dissolved 
in a little water may be added to give it the con- 
sistency of a liqueur. 

1022. CHOCOLATE LIQUEUR (1815) 

For four bottles of brandy, take one pound of 
the best chocolate, cut in small bits, a little salt, two 
cloves, and a little cinnamon ; infuse all in the 
brandy ; add two pounds of sugar clarified in two 
and a half pints of water, with whites of eggs, and 
filter it through a paper. 

1023. CINNAMON WATER (Middlesex) 

Cinnamon water is made by distillation. The 
cinnamon must be infused for several days in an 
equal quantity of water and brandy, with some 
lemon peel and liquorice, and then distiUed, being 
afterwards sweetened with sugar and filtered. The 
preparations are : one ounce of cinnamon, two 
quarts of brandy, a pint of water, the peel of a lemon, 
and an ounce of fresh liquorice root ; after distillation 
add a pound of sugar dissolved in a quart of water 
for each ounce of cinnamon. 

1024. CLOVE WATER (Middlesex) 

Clove water is a fine stomachic, either taken 
alone or as a vehicle for medicine ; it may be made 
by infusing bruised cloves in spirits of wine or 
brandy for a fortnight, and distilling it, then adding 
six times its quantity of water.

1025. COFFEE LIQUEUR (1815) 

For four bottles of brandy, take one pound of 
the best Turkey ground coffee, a little salt, two 
cloves, and a little cinnamon ; then mix all together 
for twelve hours before you distil it ; add two pounds 
of sugar, two bottles and half a pint of water clarified 
with whites of eggs, filtered through a paper. 

1026. CORIAOTDER CORDIAL (Surrey) 

Take one ounce of coriander seed, a quarter of an 
ounce of caraway seed, a small piece of cinnamon, 
and steep them for a fortnight or three weeks in one 
pint of good brandy. Strain off the Hquor and add 
to it one pint of good syrup ; mix well, and bottle. 

1027. CORIANDER WATER (Middlesex) 

The best way of using coriander for the kitchen 
is to bruise two ounces of the seed, and put it 
into a bottle with four ounces of spirits of wine. 
This must stand for a fortnight or three weeks, and 
then be filtered off. A few drops may be used for 
dislies or pastry, in which coriander seed forms a 
part of the formula. 

1028. CORNELLA OR CINNAMON CORDIAL (1815) 

For four bottles of brandy, take four ounces of 
cinnamon of the best quality, thirty cloves, thirteen 
coriander seeds, a little salt, mixed all together in

BEVERAGES 403 

or three whites of eggs well beaten together, to be 
mixed with the spirit, and filtered through blotting 
paper : after you have mixed the spirit, take care 
to cork your bottles well. 

1029. CURA9AO (Surrey) 

Make a very strong sjnrup, boil in it for five minutes 
the juice and rind of four large oranges and three 
bitter ones. Strain and filter it, add six drops of 
cinnamon and six drops of neroU. 

1030. ANOTHER WAY 

Infuse the peel of four bitter oranges in some 
spirit and syrup for a week, flavour with cinnamon, 
cloves, or mace, strain off, and add to the rest of the 
spirit and syrup ; i.e. there should be about one- 
third spirit to nearly two-thirds of syrup. 

1031. HAWTHORN BRANDY (Middlesex, 1822) 

Put as much fuU blossom of the white thorn 
(hawthorn), picked dry and clean from leaves and 
stalks, as a great bottle will hold lightly, without 
pressing down. Fill it up with French brandy, let 
it stand two or three weeks, then decant it off 
clear, and add as much sugar as may make it of a 
proper sweetness. 

1032. HAWTHORN BRANDY (Surrey) 

Take a large bottle, fiU it three-parts fuU with haw- 
thorn petals, picked when the day is dry and sunny 
(putting the flowers only, not the stalks), and fiU up 
with brandy. Let them infuse for about five or 



404 BEVERAGES 

six weeks, then strain off the hquid into a clean 
bottle, and cork up well. This imparts a delicious 
flavouring to puddings, etc. 



1033. LOVAGE (Surrey) 

Take five drachms each of oil of nutmeg and oil of 
cassia, and mix with three drachms oil of caraway 
in one quart of the best spirits of wine. It should 
be thoroughly well mixed and shaken. Then you 
put this to two gallons of spirits of wiae, and pour 
it into a ten-gallon cask. Take twenty pounds of 
lump sugar dissolved in hot water, mix into this 
a quarter of a pint of colouring of any kind preferred, 
pour all into the cask, fill up with water, and pour 
it in while hot ; lastly add one ounce of salts of 
tartar, and let the whole be well mixed and stirred. 



1034. NOYEAU (1822) 

The following recipe wiU furnish a liqueur in no 
way inferior to the veritable Martinique at not half 
the cost of the foreign article. (Smaller quantities 
may be made in proportionate admixture.) Blanch 
and pound one pound of bitter almonds, half a 
pound of sweet almonds, and two ounces of cassia 
huds, separately. Put them with two gallons of 
British gin into a barrel, and shake it every day for 
a fortnight. Then make a syrup of twelve pounds 
of sugar and three quarts of water, and put it into 
the barrel mUk-warm. Add three quarts of spirits 
of wine, one pint ratafia, four ounces of orange- 
flower water, the juice of two lemons, and a piece of 
calcined alum, about the size of a walnut. Then 



BEVERAGES 405 

add half an ounce of isinglass, dissolved in half a 
pint of gin, reserved from the two gallons for that 
purpose. Shake the barrel only once afterwards, 
let the whole remain three or four days, and then 
filter it through an earthenware colander, with 
filtering paper laid on it, changing the paper every 
time it is empty. In two days and nights, sixteen 
clear quarts will be produced. When bottling, dip 
the corks in melted resin. 

1035. NOYEAU (Kent, 1809) 

Put six ounces of bitter almonds, blanched and 
cut, into two quarts of English gin ; keep it in a 
moderate heat three days, shaking it well. Add two 
pounds of good loaf sugar, just melted in boiling 
water ; let it stand for twenty-four hours longer, 
frequently shaking the bottle. FUter it through 
double blotting paper, and it is fit for use. 

1036. NOYEAU (Kent) 

To a quart of reduced spirits put three-quarters of 
a pound of loaf sugar, one and a half ounces bitter, 
and the same of sweet, almonds, powdered very 
fine, and four tablespoonfuls boiled milk. To be 
shaken every day for twenty-one days, then filtered 
through blotting paper ; and it will be fit for use. 

1037. NOYEAU (Lancashire) 

Take two quarts of rum, the juice of three lemons, 
three pounds of double-refined sugar, two ounces 
of sweet almonds, and two ounces of bitter almonds, 
beat fine. Put the above ingredients into a deep 
covered pot, pour two quarts of new milk and one 



406 BEVERAGES 

of water boiling hot upon them, let it stand four or 
five days, stirring it two or three times a day. Run 
it through a flannel and bottle it for use. 



1038. NOYEAU (Middlesex) 

Collect the kernels of peach, apricot, and plum 
stones. Bruise them and put them to steep in 
strong spirits of wine, for a fortnight or three weeks. 
To, say, three ounces of kernels, use half a pint of 
spirit. About half a dozen blanched bitter almonds 
may be added, but not more, as they contain so 
much prussic acid. Make a syrup of one pound 
of sugar with as much water as will yield about one 
pint of syrup when boiled ; when this is cold, add a 
pint of good white French brandy (or spirits of wine 
can be used instead, but brandy is best), using as 
much of the kernel tincture (strained off) as will 
impart the right flavour. You must add the tincture 
very carefully and slowly, and taste it from time to 
time. If you want pink noyeau, boil some crushed 
cochineal in a little water, and strain it off, and add 
it drop by drop to the liqueur. 



1039. OIL OF ROSES (Surrey) 

This is a very nice liqueur. To three quarts of 
white brandy, put three pounds of roses with the 
best scent ; add one pint of water, let them infuse 
for a week in a jar, and then distil. After distilling, 
add a syrup of two pounds of sugar dissolved in three 
pints of water, and a Uttle filtered cochineal for 
colouring. 



BEVERAGES 407 

1040. ANOTHER WAY 

Put a few drops of attar of roses, according to 
taste, into a quart of good spirits of wine. Add the 
same quantity of strong syrup, and colour with a 
little tincture of cochineal. 



1041. OIL OF ROSES (French) 

Make a syrup of one pound of sugar, with as 
much water only as wiU, when boiled, yield about 
one pint of syrup. When this is quite cold, add 
one pint of good white French brandy, and about 
ten drops of attar of roses, colouring it a rich pink 
by a tincture which may be made by boiling some 
crushed cochineal in a Uttle water, and straining 
it off. 

1042. PERFETTO AMORE (1816) 

For four bottles of brandy, peel six large and fresh 
lemons ; the peels are to be very thin, cut in small 
bits, and put in the brandy with a little salt, half a 
handful of currants, five coriander seeds, five cloves, 
and a little cinnamon ; the whole to be infused 
together for twelve hours, from which draw off only 
two bottles of spirit ; then add two pounds of 
sugar, boUed and clarified in two bottles of water 
with three eggs ; take a little rock alum, which 
you must mix in a little boUiag water, and a little 
cream of tartar, mix them in a small mortar, and 
add to the liquor ; (but first you are to strain it) ; 
then mix them all together, and filter it through 
blotting-paper. 



408 BEVERAGES 

1043. PERSICO (1815) 

For four bottles of brandy, take four handfuls of 
bitter almonds of the best quality, and very fresh ; 
they are to be cut in small bits, with a little salt, 
two cloves, and a little cinnamon ; put all in the 
brandy, and infuse them for twenty hours ; add 
two bottles of spirit, two pounds of sugar, with two 
bottles of water, without clarifying it, as this liquor 
will clarify itself. 

1044. PINEAPPLE LIQUEUR 

Scrape one and a half pounds of pineapple into 
the spirit which is to be used, let it infuse for a 
week ; then drain it off and add the syrup. 

1045. MILK PUNCH (1815) 

Take two gallons and a half of French brandy, 
and infuse in it for one night the outer rind of fifteen 
lemons, and as many oranges pared very thin ; add 
to it the juice of the before-mentioned quantity of 
fruit, and fifteen quarts of cold water that has been 
boiled, seven pounds and a half of fine loaf sugar, 
and half a pint of milk ; let them be well mixed 
and stand till cold ; then add a bottle of Jamaica 
rum, put it into a cask the proper size, and stop it 
up close for a month or six weeks. N.B. — Take 
out the lemon and orange peel before you add the 
juice of the fruit and the water. 

1046. TO MAKE ANY KIND OP LIQUEUR (Surrey) 
All cloves, cinnamon, mace, or other dry ingre- 
dients must be finely ground or grated. All leaves, 



BEVERAGES 409 

flowers, peels, or rinds, must be cut or shredded as 
small as possible. All kernels or almonds must be 
pounded into a paste in a mortar, a very small 
quantity of spirits being added at the time. The 
ingredients, whatever they are, should then be 
soaked in the spirit (spirits of wine or brandy) for 
a month in a warm place, shaking up the mixture 
every day. The spirit is then poured off, and water 
added (when directed in a recipe). After a few days 
more, the Uquid is pressed out and mixed with the 
spirits ; sugar and colouring matter is added (see 
"Syrup," No. 1050), and the liquid is strained 
through a flannel bag. Good French brandy is 
always preferable even to the best spirits of wine. 

1047. TO MAKE ANY KIND OF RATAFIA (Surrey) 

The best fruits to use are red currants, black cur- 
rants, raspberries, mulberries, or cherries. Press 
out two quarts of juice of the fruit, let it stand for 
twenty-four hours in a cold place, then skim it, 
and add two quarts of good brandy, two pounds of 
sugar, a few cloves, and a little cinnamon. Mix it 
well, and put it into a stone bottle, where it must 
stand, well corked, for a month. Then pour off 
and bottle it. 

1048. RASPBERRY RATAFIA (Middlesex) 

Stand two quarts of raspberry juice in a cold 
place for twenty-four hours. Then skim it, and mix 
in two quarts of good brandy, two pounds of sugar, 
and a Uttle cinnamon and cloves. Put it in a stone 
bottle, and keep it well corked for a month, then 
pour off and bottle it. 



410 BEVERAGES 

1049. ANOTHER WAY 

Take the juice of three pounds of raspberries (or 
strawberries) straia and filter it : boil it for a few 
minutes with one and half pounds of sugar. 

1050. RATAFIA OF ROSES (Middlesex) 

Infuse a quarter of a pound of rose leaves in a 
pint of lukewarm water ; let them lie for two days 
and then press them through a cloth ; add as much 
brandy as there may be infusion, and a thick syrup, 
made in the proportion of half a pound of sugar to a 
quart of the above liquid, and a little coriander 
seed, mace, and cinnamon ; let them infuse for a 
fortnight, and then filter. 

1051. SYRUP FOR RATAFIAS, ETC. (Surrey) 

To make a strong syrup, you merely add just as 
much water as will cover your sugar in the pan, 
and boil it gently for a long time, removing the scum 
as long as it rises. The stronger the syrup is to be, 
the longer it must simmer. When cool, put it by 
in bottles for use. When it is wanted to be very 
clear, you add beaten whites of eggs to the syrup 
while it is hot, and mix them well in, and strain 
through a jelly-bag. The straining is not absolutely 
necessary : a quicker method is used in France, as 
follows : 

For ten bottles of any syrup, take seven pounds 
of sugar, break it into small bits, dissolve it in six 
pints of cold water, then filter it carefully. Mean- 
while, mix your essences and colouring with five 
pints of good spirits of wine, and add the syrup by 



BEVERAGES 411 

small quantities at a time, stirring all the while ; 
then filter the whole. This method does not give, 
however, the oily appearance which is desirable in 
liqueurs. 

1052. RATAPIA (1822) 

Boil equal quantities of gooseberries and sugar 
into a thick jelly, over which a sufficient quantity of 
white wine must be poured, and suffered to remain 
for some time. Press out and filter the mixture, and 
add half the quantity of brandy, with any spices 
that may be agreeable. 

1053. ROSOLIO (French) 

Put one drachm of vamlla into about half a pint 
of the spirit to be used. Let it stand a week, then 
strain and filter it. Use this hquor with six drops 
of neroU and five drops of attar of roses. Boil the 
syrup before mixing, with the juice of six oranges 
and one ounce of syrup of capillaire. Then filter 
and mix with the spirit. 

(The rosoho specially prepared for Louis XIV., 
said to be called thus from ros solis, dew of the sun, 
was made with equal quantities of brandy and 
Spanish wine, in which were infused angelica, anise, 
fennel, citron, coriander, and sugar-candy, boiled 
to a syrup in camomile water. Ed.) 

1064. SLOE GIN (Essex) 

Into one quart of best gin put one and a half 
pints of ripe sloes (some of them bruised), three- 
quarters of a pound of loaf sugar, and haK an ounce 
of bitter almonds (blanched and split). Cover the 



412 BEVERAGES 

vessel containing the cordial closely, and leave it 
six months, stirring the contents occasionally, then 
strain off the liquor and bottle for use. 



1055. VESPETRO (French) 

Take equal quantities of angelica seed, aniseed, 
fennel seed, and coriander seed. Put them in to 
steep in white brandy or spirits of wine for about a 
month. Shake the bottle from time to time. Then 
filter the infusion and add a mixture of strong 
syrup (about two-thirds) and spirit (about half), 
but do not drown the flavour with syrup, as this 
is a stomachic and medicinal cordial. 

1056. ANOTHER WAY 

Three ounces of angelica seed, two ounces of 
coriander seed, half an ounce each of aniseed and 
fennel seed, six ounces each of sliced oranges and 
lemons. Proceed as above. 

1057. HUILE DB VIOLETTES (French) 

Boil three ounces of dried violets for two minutes 
with water and sugar ; strain and filter, and add to 
the spirits and syrup. 



CHAPTER XXI 

INVALID AND CONVALESCENT 
COOKERY 

Note. — For the fastidious invalid, if the truth be 
told, our robust predecessors did not take much 
care to cater. If an unhappy wight should suffer 
loss of appetite and turn with disgust from ordinary 
palatable food — well, it was unfortunate, but un- 
avoidable. There were certain " possets " and 
broths and gruels provided for such unfit folk ; but 
the real regard to sick fare is of comparatively recent 
growth ; and hence the recipes under this heading 
are not numerous ; some, indeed, are quite of modem 
date. Such as they are, they are peculiarly good, 
and the " Jaunemange " and " Salisbury Minced 
Beef " are worth their weight in gold, as countless 
convalescents can bear witness. 



1058. ARROWBOOT BLANCMANGE (Kent) 

One pint of milk, sugar, cinnamon, and vanilla to 
taste, all boiled together; blend a tablespoonful 
of arrowroot with some cold milk, then pour it into 
the milk that is boiling, give it a few minutes' boil, 
and pour it into a shape,

1059. ARROWROOT JELLY (Middlesex) 

Pound three bitter almonds, and put them with 
the peel of a lemon into a large wineglass! ul of water, 
and let them steep therein for four or five hours ; 
then strain the liquid, and mix it with four table- 
spoonfuls of arrowroot, an equal quantity of lemon- 
juice, and two tablespoonfuls of brandy ; sweeten to 
taste, and stir it over the fire until it becomes quite 
thick. When cold, put it in jelly-glasses, and set by 
in a cool place. 

1060. "SALISBURY" MINCED BEEF FOR IN- 
VALIDS OR CONVALESCENTS 

One pound of lean rump steak (this will make 
two meals). Remove all fat, skin, and gristle. Put 
it three times through a mincer, and then into a 
small saucepan, with just enough water to cover it, 
and a httle salt. When it turns from red to brown 
(simmering very slowly and never coming anywhere 
near boiling), it is done enough. Serve some in a 
hot soup-dish, with bread or bread and butter. 
The remainder can be reheated once, but not twice ; 
if any is left the second time, it must be eaten cold. 
To beat it with a fork while cooking, improves it. 

106L CHICKEN PANADA (Cheshire) 

Cut up the meat from which chicken broth has 
been made, pound it in a mortar if obtainable, or 
roll it with a rolling-pin. Put it in a pan on the fire 
with a little milk and salt ; stir it, but do not let it 
boil. Add a few bread crumbs to thicken it; stir 
in one whole egg to each quarter of a fowl. It may 



INVALID AND CONVALESCENT COOKERY 415 

be used either as spoon-meat when hot, or made into 
little balls and served in the chicken broth. It will 
keep good for some days. 

1062. WHITE-OF-EGG FLIP (Surrey) 

This is a doctor's recipe for a nourishing pick-me- 
up, of which a spoonful or two can be taken at odd 
moments. It has the advantage of utiKsing the 
whites of eggs left over from the Jaunemange. 
Beat three whites to a stiff froth ; add (for colour 
and flavour) a teaspoonful of good strawberry jam, 
and beat it well in ; lastly, beat in one dessert- 
spoonful of brandy. Brandy, by the way, should 
here be regarded purely as medicine, and as you 
would not willingly administer cheap medicine to 
an invalid, procure the best cognac that your means 
will allow. It pays in the long run. 

1063. JAUNEMANGE (Hampshire) 

Take one ounce of Swinborne's isinglass, put it 
into a jar or basin, pour half a pint of cold water 
over it, add the rind of a large lemon cut very thinly. 
Let it stand for at least ten minutes. Then add to it 
a quarter of a pound of loaf sugar, the juice of one and 
a half lemons, a tablespoonful of brandy, and a wine- 
glassful of sherry. If no sherry is added, put a little 
more water, the yolks of four fresh eggs well-beaten, 
and half a pint of boiling water. The whole to be 
very well mixed, care being taken that the eggs do 
not " break." Now stand the jar in a pan of boiling 
water, and let the jaunemange just nearly come to 
the boil ; it needs careful attention and stirring. 



416 INVALID AND CONVALESCENT COOKERY 

When the ingredients are quite melted, take out the 
lemon-peel. Lift the jaunemange out and stand 
it in a bowl of cold water to set, or in a cool place. 
Or pour it off, when a little cool, into a mould. This 
is an exceedingly nourishing and strengthening 
preparation, and can be taken at any time, a few 
teaspoonfuls being sufficient. It is so pleasant to 
the taste, and so unlike anything else, that the 
most fastidious invalid will hardly refuse it. In 
cases involving diarrhoea, the lemon-juice had better 
be omitted. '^ 

1064. BEEF JELLY (Surrey) 
Take a small knuckle of veal, break it into small 
pieces, and let it soak two hours in two pints of 
cold water. Then boil it till reduced to a pint. 
Strain it. Take one pound of lean beef, remove aU 
skin and fat, and scrape or finely mince it. Let 
it stand in a jar in one pint of cold water for one hour. 
Then cover the jar and put it in a saucepan of cold 
water, and let it warm very slowly till it simmers. 
Then strain it, add the veal stock and a Httle pepper 
and salt, and pour off into a mould to cool. 

1065. BREAD JELLY (Kent, 1809) 
Take a penny French roll, cut it in thin slices, and 
toast it a pale brown, boil it in a quart of water 
till it comes to a pint, then strain it, and add wine 
and sugar to your taste. 

1066. CLARET JELLY (Kent) 
Take one bottle of claret, ten ounces of loaf 
sugar, a one pound pot of red currant jelly, the peel 



INVALID AND CONVALESCENT COOKERY 417 

and juice of one lemon, and a quarter of an ounce 
of best isinglass. Let this simmer for a few minutes, 
and add half a wineglassful of brandy, and strain 
through muslin into a mould. 

1067. PORT WINE JELLY (Sussex) 

One ounce of isinglass, one ounce of gum arable, 
three ounces of sugar-candy, one pint of port wine. 
Soak the dry ingredients in the wine all night, then 
let all simmer for half an hour. 

1068. PORT WINE JELLY (Kent, 1809) 

One ounce of gum arable, one ounce of isinglass, a 
little spice, boiled half an hour in a pint of cold 
water, then add a pint and a quarter of old port 
wine and sugar to your taste. Let it simmer a 
quarter of an hour, strain it off, and keep it for use. 
It may be taken cold or hot. 

1069. RESTORATIVE JELLY (Kent, 1809) 

Dissolve an ounce of isinglass in a quart of water, 
let it simmer gently till reduced to a pint, then add 
half a pound of fine loaf sugar. When dissolved, 
strain it off, and put it into a pudding-dish in the 
cellar till cold. To be taken in the quantity neces- 
sary to sweeten any liquid such as tea, etc. 

1070. STRENGTHENING JELLY (Kent, 1809) 

One ounce of best isinglass, one ounce of gum 

arable, infused together in haK a pint of (either) 

Tent, Mountain, or Calcavella, for twenty-four hours, 

then add one ounce of brown sugar-candy pulverised ; 

27 



418 INVALID AND CONVALESCENT COOKERY 

these are to be simmered and (to prevent burning) 
must be constantly stirred^ until the whole is dis- 
solved. Strain it through a fine hair sieve, and 
when cold it becomes a stiff jelly. A piece the size 
of a large nutmeg to be taken two or three times a 
day, or at night, according as it agrees. 



1071. PORT WINE LOZENGES (Kent, 1809) 

Take two ounces of isinglass and half an ounce of 
gum arable. Steep them all night in a pint of port 
wine ; then put them in a saucepan, with two ounces 
of brown sugar-candy and half a nutmeg grated. 
Simmer them together till quite dissolved, strain 
through a hair sieve, and pour on clean plates to 
harden. Cut it in pieces, and take a piece the size 
of a nutmeg three times a day.

1072. APPLE BARLEY-WATER (Cheshire) 

Add to one pint of the above half a pound of 
apples, cut in slices, with the sldn on, removing only 
the pips ; cut a lemon in slices, boil gently till the 
apples are done, and pass through a colander. 

1073. APPLE TOAST-AND-WATER (Cheshire) 

Bake an apple with a little brown sugar over it, 
and add to the toast-and-water. It will be ready 
in an hour. A little lemon or orange-peel is an im- 
provement. 



INVALID AND CONVALESCENT COOKERY 419 

1074. AROMATIC BARLEY-WATEK (Cheshire) 

Take one quart of barley-water, boil it down to 
one-third. Add to it, while it is hot, a pint of sherry, 
one drachm of tincture of cinnamon, and one ounce 
of sugar. Three ounces of this can be taken two 
or three times a day. A good cordial. 

1075. PEARL BARLEY-WATER (Cheshire) 

Wash two ounces of pearl-barley well in cold 
water. Add about one and a half pints of water, a 
little lemon peel, and sugar to taste. Let it simmer, 
stirring it often till it is of a nice thickness. Strain 
and add lemon juice. A few sweet almonds beaten 
to a paste will give a pleasant flavour. 

1076. BEEF TEA (Lancashire) 
One pound of gravy beef, one pint of cold water, 
half a teaspoonful of salt. Shred meat finely, place 
in an earthenware jar, add the water and salt. 
Cover closely. Place jar in a saucepan of boiling 
water, or in the oven, and cook for three hours. Stir 
occasionally. 

1077. GOOD COOLING DRINK (Cheshire) 

Take half an ounce of cream of tartar, the strained 
juice of one lemon, two tablespoonfuls of honey, one 
quart of boiling water. Cover up till cold. 

1078. IMPERIAL (Surrey) 

Put two drachms of cream of tartar, the juice of 
one lemon, and a little peel, into a jug ; pour on them 
one quart of boiling water ; sweeten to taste. Stir, 
and cover close till cold. 



420 INVALID AND CONVALESCENT COOKERY 

1079. LIVELY IMPERIAL (Kent, 1809) 

Two ounces of cream of tartar, two pounds of 
lump sugar, four lemons sliced. Put them in a pan. 
Two gallons of boiling water must be poured over 
the above. When near cold, add two dessert- 
spoonfuls of yeast. Let it stand two days, and then 
strain and bottle it. Cork it close, and in three days 
it will be fit for use. 

1080. QUIET IMPERIAL (Kent, 1809) 

Seven quarts of water, two ounces of cream of 
tartar, the peel of two or three lemons. Boil it 
just to simmer, then take it off, and pour it on a 
pound of sugar and let it stand till the next day. 

1081. SAGO POSSET (Cheshire) 

Boil three ounces of sago in a quart of water, 
till a mucilage is formed. Rub half an ounce of loaf 
sugar on the rind of a lemon, and put it, with a tea- 
spoonful of ginger tincture, into half a pint of sherry. 
Add to this the sago mucilage, and boil the whole 
for five minutes. This is an excellent cordial, where 
acute diseases (not of an inflammatory kind) have 
left the patient in a state of debiUty. A httle may 
be taken at a time, every four or five hours 



CHAPTER XXII

This final section includes such recipes as do not fall 
with accuracy under any of the previous headings, 
but are too useful to leave out. 



1082. BREAD CRUMBS FOR ROAST GAME (Surrey) 

Put some stale white bread through a coarse sieve, 
and fry the crumbs in fresh butter, enough to saturate 
them well. Turn and stir them in the pan tiU they 
are a nice hght brown, but not too brown ; drain 
them on a sieve before the fire. 



1083. TO PRESERVE BUTTER (Ireland) 

Take two parts of the best common salt, one part 
sugar, and one part saltpetre. Beat them up to- 
gether, and blend the whole completely. Take one 
ounce of this composition for every sixteen ounces 
of butter. Work it well into the mass, and close 
it up for use. Butter thus cured requires to stand 
a month before it is begun to be used ; it will then 
be delicious. 

421 



422 VARIOUS 

1084. TO PRESERVE BUTTER FIRM IN 

SUMMER (Kent) 

Get a large bowl, and fill it with silver sand, 
leaving a hole in the centre, in which stand a smaller 
bowl with your butter in. Keep the sand just moist 
with cold water, and your butter will remain firm 
in the hottest weather. 

1085. RICE FOR CURRY (Middlesex) 

The rice to be served with curry should be of the 
best quahty, and should be washed perfectly clean ; 
it may be then boiled in a bag, or as follows : — 
BoU half a pound of rice for about twenty minutes 
in one quart of cold water, then put it to drain in a 
sieve, after which dry it before the fire to get rid 
of all superfluous moisture, stirring from time to 
time, and serve very hot. 

1086. CURRY POWDER (Kent, 1809) 

Coriander seed, six ounces ; cummin seed, one and 
half oimces ; fenugreek seed, one and a half ounces ; 
turmeric root, three ounces. To be made into a 
fine powder, with the addition of cayenne to your 
taste. 

1087. CURRY POWDER (Middlesex) 

Pound six ounces of coriander seed, three ounces 
of black pepper, and one and a half ounces of fenu- 
greek seed, one ounce of cummin seed, three ounces 
of turmeric, and three-quarters of an ounce of cayenne : 
sift through muslin, and dry it thoroughly for 
several hours before the fire, stirring repeatedly ; 



VARIOUS 423 

then bottle, and cork very tightly. If the powder 
be made for the use of persons who have lived much 
in India, and been accustomed to eat curry there, 
the quantity of cayenne should be increased to an 
ounce, or even one and a quarter ounces. Another 
preparation of curry is made by omitting the cori- 
ander seed, doubling the quantity of turmeric, and 
substituting for the coriander two ounces of ginger : 
in fact, if turmeric and cayenne be made the basis of 
the powder, the other ingredients may be varied 
according to taste. 



1088. IRISH FADGE 

Mix a quarter of a pint of milk and three ounces 
of butter together over the fire. Then take four 
ounces of whole brown meal — (wheaten meal) and 
pour in the milk and butter to a hole in the middle 
of the meal. Knead it well and roll it out to about 
three-quarters of an inch thick. Bake on a griddle, 
turning it often to prevent burning. Time, one hour. 

1089. MOCK ICE (Middlesex) 

You can make a sort of mock ice, by mixing half 
a pint of water, in which rather more than a quarter 
of an ounce of isinglass has been boiled, with a pint 
of cream and a sufficient quantity of sugar, and the 
juice of any fruit ; the mixture must be made before 
the solution of isinglass is quite cold. If you have 
any ice at hand, this mixture can be set in a mould 
in some vessel, and surrounded with ice ; or if there 
be none, put it in the coldest situation possible. 
The sohd appearance given to the mixture, when 



424 VARIOUS 

cold, by the isinglass, causes this to be a pretty good 
imitation of an ice, if it can be made quite cold. 

1090. LIME WATER FOR PRESERVING EGGS 
(Yorkshire) 

Take one pound of stone lime, two handfuls of 
salt, two gallons of water. The water to be boiling, 
and poured upon the lime and salt, and to be stirred 
every day. In a fortnight it is ready for use. 
Be careful the eggs are not cracked. 

1091. MUSTARD (Seventeenth Century) 
Dry your mustard seed very well, then beat it by 
little and little at a time in a mortar, and sift it. 
Then put the powder in a gallipot, and wet it very 
well with vinegar ; put in a whole onion peeled 
but not cut, a little pepper and salt, and a lump 
of sugar. 

1092. ANOTHER WAY 
Take horseradish roots and make them very dv} 
in an oven, then beat them to powder. And when 
you would use any, wet it with wine vinegar, and 
so it will rather be better than the other. 

1093. MUSTARD (Surrey) 
If mustard be mixed, first with the merest drop of 
water, and then with tarragon vinegar, it will have 
a pleasant^ pungency and piquancy which gives a 
relish to every dish. This is half the secret of French 
mustard^which is also much milder than ours, and 
occasionally, I believe, has a dash of flour put in, 
beside other ingredients. 



VARIOUS 425 

1094. PORRIDGE (Ireland) 

Irish porridge is particularly good, being made of 
specially fragrant oatmeal. Boil a quart of water 
with a large teaspoonful of salt in it. When boiling, 
pour in one and a half teacupfuls of meal (more or 
less according to taste), without stirring at all, and 
keep it gently boiling twenty to thirty minutes ; 
then stir well, and serve in bowl or porridge plate 
(like small soup plate), very hot. It should be taken 
with cold milk, and, if liked, a small piece of butter 
in the middle of the plate. A double saucepan 
should be used. In England, sugar is used, and 
stirring. There is no need for the latter, as, if not 
stirred at first, the porridge will not burn, just like 
rice. 

1095. POT-POURRI (1822) 

Take one pound each of orange flowers and of com- 
mon rose leaves, half a pound of the flowers of red 
pinks, leaves and flowers of myrtle ; flowers of musk 
roses, leaves of thyme, lavender, rosemary, sage, 
camomile, melilot, hyssop, sweet basil, and balm, 
two ounces of each ; two or three handfuls of jessa- 
mine flowers, a large handful of lemon rinds, cut 
as thin as possible ; the same quantity of rinds of 
small green oranges (tangerines), and fifteen or 
twenty laurel leaves. Put them all into a well- 
headed earthen jar, with half a poxind of bay salt, 
and stir the whole carefully with a wooden spatula, 
or spoon, twice a day for a month. Then add 
Florentine white orris and benzoin, of each twelve 
ounces ; powdered cloves and cinnamon, two ounces. 
of each ; mace, storax, calamus aromaticus, and 



426 VARIOUS 

cypress, of each one ounce ; lemon-coloured sandal, 
and long sweet cypress, of each six drachms. Stir 
all together, and if the proportions be carefuUy 
attended to, according to the above directions, a 
most delightful compound of fine odours will be 
obtained, in which no one scent will predominate, 
while the fragrance of the whole will remain unim- 
paired for a great number of years. 



1096. ROSE-WATER (Surrey) 

Gather the rose-leaves very dry, add a quart of 
water to every four pounds of petals, and place them 
with a handful of salt, in a closely stoppered vessel. 
Leave them so for three days, stirring them well at 
least once a day : at the end of that time, distil the 
mixture, take care to line the bottom of the still with 
a sufficient amount of clean straw to keep the 
flowers from burning, and leave a space of at least 
one-third in the still. For every twelve pounds of 
flowers you put in, add six quarts of water ; and 
when, for every twelve pounds, three quarts have 
been drawn off, stop distilling. A very much 
stronger rose-water is made thus : Take thirty 
pounds of rose-leaves, gathered before sunrise, 
crush them in a large mortar, and put them into a 
jar, with four pounds of common salt, in alternate 
layers of roses and sprinkled salt. Press them down 
well, and cover the jar so that no perfume can 
escape. When they have macerated for twelve 
days, distil them with a sharp heat, protecting them 
carefully as described above. The result of this dis- 
tillation will be small in quantity, but rich in quality.

1097. HINTS ON STORAGE (Surrey) 

It is advisable to keep all groceries in closed tins 
or jars, not in paper or cardboard : the drier articles 
in tins ; the moister, such as raisins, etc., in jars. 
It is essential that all store-provisions should be 
kept covered, otherwise they accumulate dust and 
germs, and become really imfit for use, even though 
they may not appear so. This is a fact which no 
servant can get into her head, and which requires 
constant attention. 

Stock should be boiled (not merely warmed up) 
every day. Dripping should be examined and 
clarified at least twice a week in warm weather. 
Pieces of bread should be utilised, so far as possible, 
day by day ; the crumb can be sieved, dried in the 
oven, and kept in a closed tin for use in frying fish, 
etc., but it will not keep too long. The crust can be 
soaked overnight, when sufiicient has been col- 
lected, for use in a bread pudding. Those who keep 
fowls, or pigs, have no need of instruction in the 
disposal of their odds and ends. 

MADE GRAVIES AND SAUCES 

A few drops of Lea & Perrins' Sauce make an 
excellent flavouring for soups, stews, gravies, minced 
meat,, etc., and harmonise well with any other flavour- 
ing agent that may be used. 

FISH SAUCES 
A good proprietory sauce should always be kept in 
the house. One that goes well with any kind of fish 
is Lea & Perrins', which has the advantage of being an 
all-roand sauce, suitable for hot and cold meats, soaps, 
stews, etc.
