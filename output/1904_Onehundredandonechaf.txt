THE chafing-dish is valued by 
the epicure for the conven- 
ience, and by the amateur 
for the fun of it, and seems always 
a synonym for hospitality and an 
appetite. 

It is placed on a metal tray for 
safety and cleanliness, and one with 
a lower pan for hot water is almost 
a necessity, in cooking, and to 
keep the dishes warm. 

Most of the foods for the vari- 
ous dishes are prepared beforehand 
in the kitchen and placed, with the 
seasonings needed, conveniently at 
hand in dishes and on trays.

«%. 



^ AUNT DINAH ^ 

SCALD four cupfuls of milk 
with a slice of onion, two stalks 
of celery, two blades of mace, 
a sprig of parsley and a bay leaf. 
Remove the seasonings and add 
the strained liquor from a quart of 
oysters, pepper and salt, and two 
tablespoonfuls of butter creamed 
with two of flour. Cook all to- 
gether, and then put in the oysters 
and cook until they are plump and 
the edges begin to curl. 

d^ BATTER LOAF ^ 

MIX four tablespoonfuls of 
sifted flour, one of olive 
oil, a little salt and the 
beaten whites of two eggs; add 
enough warm water to make a 
rather thick batter. Take two 
dozen large oysters, dry them on 
a. soft cloth, dust each oyster very 
lightly with salt and pepper and 
dip separately into the batter and 
fry a golden brown in deep olive 
oil. Serve on a napkin with sliced 
lemon. 

t^ BUNDLES W 

CUT nice, even slices of the 
breast of cold roast turkey; 
over each piece lay a thin 
shaving of bacon, and put on top 
of each piece of bacon a large, fat 
oyster. Roll these bundles up 
and tie securely, season with pep- 



per and salt, and place in the pan 
with melted butter. Cover and 
cook long enough to cook the ba- 
con, basting frequently with the 
melted butter. Serve with a sprig 
of parsley on each one and pour 
over the brown gravy thickened 
with a little flour. 

t^ COCKTAIL t^ 

TAKE a pint of small oysters 
with the liquor that comes 
with them ; add a cupful of 
tomato catsup, the juice of two 
lemons, one tablespoonful of Wor- 
cestershire sauce, salt and six drops 
of Tabasco. Heat in the chafing- 
dish and serve hot in cocktail 
glasses. 

7^ EN CACHETTE ^ 

SOAK one cupful of cracker 
crumbs in as much milk as 
they will absorb; add a tea- 
spoonfiil of softened butter, one- 
quarter of a teaspoonful of salt, a 
dash of white pepper and nutmeg, 
one-half of a tablespoonful of 
chopped parsley and one beaten 
egg yolk. Form into small cakes, 
hide a fat oyster in each one and 
saute a pale brown in olive oil. 

FIGARO OMELET 

BEAT six eggs very light, and 
add to them one-half a cup 
of sweet cream, and salt and 
pepper to taste. Melt a table- 

5 



spoonful of butter in the pan and 
pour the omelet evenly in. Cut 
twelve large oysters in half and 
scatter over the top with a little 
chopped parsley. Fry a light 
brown, fold the omelet over from 
the two sides, and serve at once. 

GUMBO OYSTERS 

SAUTE a few dices of salt pork 
with a tablespoonful of minced 
onion until nicely browned; 
add a tablespoonful of flour, and 
when it is well blended with the 
fat, put in a cupful of chicken 
broth, a teaspoonful of minced 
peppers and a cupful each of 
cooked okra and tomatoes. Sea- 
son with salt and pepper and strain 
in the liquor from a pint of fresh 
oysters. Lastly put in the oysters, 
and as soon as they are plump, 
pour over hot Boston crackers, 
split and buttered. Gumbo pow- 
der can be used instead of the okra, 

_, OYSTERS A LA ^ 
^ POULETTE ^ 

SCALD two dozen oysters in 
their own liquor until plump, 
and strain. Put in the pan 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, and 
when melted, stir in four table- 
spoonfuls of flour until perfectly 
smooth; then add the oyster juice, 
one cupful of cream, pepper, salt, 
and a dash of nutmeg. Take 
from the flame, and when a little 
cool, stir in the beaten yolks of 



four eggs and return to the fire 
and stir until thick. Drop the 
oysters in for a second and pour 
immediately on a hot platter. 

PANNED OYSTERS 

HEAT the pan very hot. Put 
into it a tablespoonful of 
butter, then the oysters, 
which have been well drained. 
Cook until well browned. Have 
ready some even pieces of toast, 
soften them with some of the 
liquor from the pan, place three or 
four oysters on each piece, and 
pour over them the rest of the 
liquor. Sprinkle over the top a 
little chopped parsley, and garnish 
with lemon slices. 

tt^ PEPPER STEW 2^ 

REMOVE the seeds from two 
small green peppers, chop 
fine, and fry for five minutes 
in two tablcspoonfuls of butter; 
add one-half of a cupful of the 
strained oyster juice, a saltspoon 
of salt, dusting of white pepper 
and twenty-five finely chopped 
oysters. Simmer for five minutes, 
pour in half a glass of sherry, heat 
for a moment and serve, poured 
over buttered toast fingers. 

RAREBIT OF OYSTERS 

BREAK into small pieces one- 
half of a pound of rich cheese, 
and put into the pan with a 
tablespoonful of melted butter. 



Remove the hard muscles from a 
pint of oysters and cook them un- 
til plump; drain and keep hot. 
Beat up the yolks of two eggs, add 
oyster liquor and oysters, and stir 
into the melted cheese. Toast 
bread on one side only, and serve 
on the untoasted side. 

STEAMED OYSTERS 

CAREFULLY wash the shells 
and pack them in the pan 
with their upper shells down- 
ward, so the deep shell will hold 
their juice as they open. Place 
the pan over the hot water and 
cover closely, laying a napkin on 
the top and a weight on the cover. 
Keep the water boiling rapidly 
until the shells open, which will be 
about fifteen minutes. Serve at 
once in the shells, using butter, 
salt and pepper to season them. 

UNIVERSITY GRILL 

DRAIN off all the liquor from 
a pint of oysters and put 
them in a hot chafing-dish. 
As the liquor flows from the oysters, 
dip it out with a spoon and keep 
them as dry as possible, until they 
are plump. Sprinkle them with 
salt and pepper and add two table- 
spoonfuls of butter. Lay each one 
on a zephyrette and pour the 
liquor over.
