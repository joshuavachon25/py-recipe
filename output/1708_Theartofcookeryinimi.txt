Original to come from the lnftin£i: of Na. 
ture^ which is the beft Miftrefs upon all oc-

cellent for their Philofophical and Mathema- 
tical Obfervations^ they fearch'd into all the 
Springs of Adion • and tho' I muft condemn 
their Superftition^ I camiot but applaud their 
Inventions. This People had a vaft Diftrift

Animal , whofe Jaws being very oblong ^ 
give him the Opportunity of having a great 
many Teeth ; and his Habitation and Bud- 
nefs lying moft in the Water ^ he^ like our 
modern Dntcb-rrhitfiers m Sonthrvark^ had a 
very good Stomach ^ and was extremely vo- 
racious. It is certain that he had the Water 
of Nile always ready^ and confequently the 
Opportunity of wa(hing his Mouth after 
Meals • yet he had farther occafion for other 
Inftruments to cleanfe his Teeth^ which are 
ferrate^ or like a Saw. To this end Nature 
has provided an Animal call'd the Ichneumon^

the life of Siher Forks with m^ by fome of 
our fpruce Gallants tal^en up of late^ came from 
heme into Italy, and front thence into England. 
I cannot agree with this Learned Doftor in 
many of thefe Particulars. For firft the ufe 
of thefe Sticks is not fo much to fa've Lin- 
nen ^ as out of pure Necefiity^ which arifes 
from the length of their Nails^ which Perfons 
qf great Qiiality in thofe Countries wear at 
a prodigious lengthy to prevent all poffibility 
of workings or being ferviceable to them- 
felves or others • and therefore if they would, 
they could not eafily feed themfelves with 
thofe Claws • and I have very good Autho- 
rity that in the Faf^ and efpecially mjapan^ 
the Princes have the Meat put into their 
Mouths by their Attendants. Befides, thefe 
Sticks are of no ufe but for their fore of 
Meat, which being Tilau ^ is all boil'd to 
Rags. But what would thofe Sticks fignific 
to carve a Turkey-cock, or a Chine of Beef ? 
Therefore our Forks are of quite difterenc 
Shape, the Steel ones are Bidental^ and the 
Silver generally refembling Tridents •, which

I am much of his Opinion, and could only 
' wifli that the World was throughly inform'd 
of two other Truths concerning Eggs : One 
is^ how incomparably better Koajied Eggs are 
than boil'd; the other, never to eat ^ny 
Butter with; Eggs in the Shell : You cannot 
imagine how much more you will have of 
their Flavour , and how much eafier they 
will fit upon your Stomach. The worthy

Sometimes when Horace's Rules come too

Amidft the variety of Direftions which 
Horace gives us in his Jrt of Poetry^ that is 
one of the moft accurate Pieces that he or 
any other Author has wrote ^ there is a fe- 
cret Conne61:ion in reality^ though he does 
not exprefs it too plainly^ and therefore this

To Mr. 



Dear Sir, 

I Have refleded upon the Difcourfe I had 
with you the other Day^ and upon fe- 
rious Confideration find , that the true un- 
derftanding of the whole Art of Cookery ^ will 
be ufeful to all Perfons that pretend to the 
Belles- Lettres^ and efpecially to Poets. 

I do not find it proceeds from any Enmity 
of the Cooks y but it is rather the fault of their 
Majiers^ that Poets are not fo well acquainted 
with good Eatings as otherwife they might 
be, if oftener invited : However ^ even in 
Mr. Wrfeys Prefence, this I would be 

bound 



Dr. Lifter, and others. 2 9 

bound to fay, That a good Dinner is Brother 
to a good Poem ; only it is fomething more 
fubftantial, and between two and three a Clock 
more agreeable. 

I have known a Supper make the moft di- 
verting part of a Comedy : Mr. Betterion in 
the Libertifie has fat very gravely with the 
Leg of a Chicken , but I have feen Jacomo 
very merry, and eat very heartily of Peafe, 
and butter'd Eggs under the Table. The Hoji 
in the Villain ^ who carries Tables ^ Stools, 
Furniture and Provifions all about him, gives 
great Content to the Speftators, when from 
the Crown of his Hat he produces his cold 
Capon 5 fo ArmariUis (or rather Parthenope^ 
as I take it) in the Rehearfal^ with her Wine 
in her Spear, and her Pye in her Helmet- 
and the Cook^ that flobbers his Beard w^ith 
Sack Poffet, in the Mans the Majier ^ have, 
in my Opinion, made the moft diverting 
part of the Aflion. Thefe Embeliihrnents 
we have receiv'd from our Imitation of the 
antient Poets : Horace , in his Satyrs, makes 
Mec£nc^s very merry with the RecoIIeSion of 

the 



30 LETTERS t6 

t;he,unufual Entertainment and Diflies giveif' 
him, by tiafidienm ; and with his Raillery up- 
on Garlick in his third Epode. The Supper 
of Petmims with all its Machines and Con. 
trivances^ gives us the moft lively Defcription 
of Nero's Luxury. Jwz/enal Spends a whole 
Satyr about the Pxice and Drefling of a fin- 
gle Fifli , with the Judgment of the Romm 
Senate concerning it. Thus, whether fe- 
rious or jocofe , good Eating is made the 
Subject and Ingredient of Poetical Enter- 
tainments* 

I think all Poets agree that Episodes are to 
be interwove in their Poems )vith the greateft 
Nicety of Art • and fo it is the fame thing at 
a good Table ^ and yet I have feen a very, 
good Epifode (give me leave to call it fo) 
made by fending out the Leg of a Goofe^ 
or the Gizzard of a Turkey to be broiFd : 
Tho* I know that Criticks^ with a good Sto- 
much^ have been offended that the Unity of 
A^ion (hou'd be fo far broken. And yet/ 
as in our Plays ^ fo at our common Jables^ 
many Epifodes are allow^'d^ as dicing of Cu-' 

cumbers^

A Poet^ who by proper Exprefllons ^ and 
pleaiing Images is to lead us into the Know- 
ledge of neceflary Truth^ may delude his Au- 
dience extremely, and indeed barbaroufly, 
unlefs he has fome Knowledge of this Art of 
Cook^ry^ and the Progrefs of it. Would it 
not found ridiculous to hear Alexander the 
Great to command his Cannon to be mounted^ 
and to throw red hot Bullets out of his Mor^ 
tar-pieces ? Or to have Statira talk of Tape-- 
flry Hangings^ which all the Learned know, 
were many Years after her Death, firfi: hung 
lip m the Hall of King Attala ? Should 
Sir John Falflaffe complain of having durty'd

were takea out pouring boiling Vinegar upon 
them. The Learned Annotator obferves^ that 
the beft way of keeping the Liquor in Oyfters 
is by laying the deep Shell downwards, and 
that by this means Apicins convey 'd Oyfters 
to Tiberius when in Parthia. A noble Inven- 
tion fince made ufe of at Colchejier with moft 
admirable Suf cefs. What Eftates might Brarvn 
or Locket have got in thofe Days ^ when A- 
ficins only for boiling of Sprouts after a new 
Faihion, defervedly came into the good Gra- 
ces of Drufns who then commanded the Ro- 
wan Armies. 

The firft Book having treated of Sauces%)r 
ftanding Pickles for Relifh, which ^reus'd in 
moft of the fucceeding Receipts. The fecond 
has a glorious SubjeS: of Saufages^ both with 
Skins and without, which contains Matters no 
lefs remarkable than the former. The Antients 
that were delicate in their eating prepared their 
own Muflirooms with an Amber or at leaft a 
Silver Knife ; where the Annotator fliews ele- 
gantly againft Hardoimis ^th^it the wholcKmk^

I hope we may in time arrive to • for the Bri^ , 
tains ^ tho' not very forward in inventions^ 
yet are out-done by no Nations in Imitation, 
or Improvdments. 

The third Book is of fuch Edible? as are pro- 
duc'd in Gardens. Tho: Romans us d Nitre to, 
make their Herbs look green ,' the ; Annotator^ 
fhews our Salt-Peter at prefent to differ from the 
antient N/Vr^. Apicius had a way of mincing 
them firfi: with 0\\ and Salt, and fo boihng 
^m^ which Tliny commends. But the prefent 
Receipt is to let the Water boil well, throw 
in Salt, and a bit of Butter, and fo not only 
Sprouts but Spinage v/ill be green. There is 
a moft extraordinary Obfervation of the Edi- 
tors^ to which I cannor but agree^ That it 
is a vulgar Error that Walnut Trees, like Ktif^ 
fianWives^ thrive the better for being beaten, 
and that long Poles and Stones are us'd by 
Boys and others to get the Fruit down^ the 
Walnut-Tree being fo very high they cou'd 
not othei-wife reach it, rather out of Kindnef? 
to themfelves^ than any Regard to the Tree 
that bears it. As for Jfparagus there is an

excellent Remark , that according to Pliny I 
they were the great Care of the antient Gard- 
ner?, and that at Ka*venna three weigh'd a 
Pound 5 but that in England it was thought a ^ 
Rarity when lOO of them weigh'd thirty, ] 
That Cucumbers are apt to rife in the Stomachy i 
itnlefs par'd or boiFd with Oyl^ Vinegar and 
Honey. That the Egyptians won d drink hard 
without any Difturbance^ becaufe it was a J 
Rule for them to have always boiVd Cabbage ' 
for their firft Difli at Supper. That the beft \ 
way to roft Onions is in Colewort Leaves^ for i 
fear of burning 'em* That Beets are good for 
Smiths^ becaufe they working at the Fire are i 
generally coftive. That Fetronius has recorded i 
a little old Woman who fold the Agrejie Ohts \
