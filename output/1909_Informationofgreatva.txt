INTRODUCTORY 




What This Book Is 

HE first object of the publishers, in presenting 
this book to you, is to make it of such real value 
that you would not be without it. No expense 
has been spared to get the most reliable and 
concise information, and to put it in such shape 
that it can be readily used. Although there is great de- 
mand for these books, they are NEVER SOLD, and can 
only be secured through the advertisers. 

The patronage of the newly-married is valued highly 
by all merchants, and the advertisers whose story appears 
in this book have combined in this presentation for several 
reasons : 

First — By combining they can present to you a book 
of such cost that no one advertiser could afford it. 

Second — Being a community in intererest, each adver- 
tiser sees to it that no unworthy proposition is offered to 
the holders of this book through its pages. 

Third — Many newly-married folks have done little or 
no shopping previous to marriage, for the goods they will 
now need, and the information as to where to buy each 
kind is of great value. 

The advertisers stand squarely back of any statement 
they make in this book, and guarantee its honesty and 
correctness. 

In presenting this book to you, we are making an 
honest solicitation of your patronage, and would appreciate 
it if, when purchasing, you would mention this book. 

Whether we gain your patronage and business friend- 
ship or not, we hope the book will be of great value to you. 

Yours respectfully, 

THE ADVERTISERS.

YOUR ACCOUNT IS INVITED INTRODUCE YOURSELF 




A — A check account enables you to pay bills by mail, saving time; forms a complete 
record of expsnditures, and furnishes you receipts for your payments. 

B — Everyone should have a savings account. The amounts that go into it from time 
to time without being missed will some day prove a great blessing. 

C — Free yourself from care and worry over your valuables. The cost of a private 
box in our vaults is so small ($3.00 a year) that it would be foolish to allow 
yourself the worry and take the risk of loss. 

D — Your account is invited because it will help you and us. 

E — Introduce yourself. Even in a big town like tbis, it is probable that we know 
some of your friends.

36 INFORMATION OF VALUE 



IN CASE OF FIRE 

OR 

NEED OF POLICE 

Do not waste time looking for a policeman or a 
fire alarm box. Unless one is right at hand, go 
to the nearest telephone, either Bell or Keystone, 
and simply ask the operator for " ELECTRICAL 
BUREAU." When you get them, explain your 
trouble, and it will be attended to immediately. 
Telephone companies make NO CHARGE for this 
service, so you can use the nearest phone. 



TO PREVENT FIRE 

NEVER allow matches around unless in metal 
covered receptacles. Many fires occur from 
matches becoming overheated, or being gnawed 
by rats or mice. 

NEVER allow matches to be around where chil- 
dren can get at them. 

NEVER go away or to bed leaving the drafts 
open in the heater or stove. 

NEVER put hot ashes in wooden receptacles. 

NEVER allow rags that are oily, or have had 
benzine, gasoline or naptha on them to lie around. 

NEVER use benzine, gasoline or naptha in a 
room where there is a light or a fire. 

NEVER allow lighted cigar or cigarette stubs to 
be placed near inflamable material. 

NEVER allow damp matting, carpet, rags, mat- 
tresses, etc., to lie in a heap. 

ALWAYS BE WATCHFUL

INFORMATION OF VALUE 



Weddings 



INVITATIONS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS. 

Invitations or Announcements should be on four-page, dull-surfaced, 
white, cream, or pearl paper, enclosed in double envelopes. The inner en- 
velopes should bear the name of the person it is sent to. "At Home" cards, 
reception cards, church cards, or any enclosures should be separately printed. 

Receptions which follow weddings held before or about noon should be 
called wedding breakfasts. 

For church weddings it is customary to say "Request the honor of (fill 
in name) presence," but for house weddings it should be "Desire your pres- 
ence," or "Invite you to be present." 

All names should be spelled out in full, and no titles used except in the 
case of military officers. 

The words "morning," "afternoon" or "evening" should follow the hour 
on invitations, and it is good form to give the year. On announcements, the 
hour is unnecessary. 

Invitations or announcements may be issued by either of the parents of 
the bride, or by her bachelor brother, or by the bride and groom themselves. 

When announcements are issued by the bride and groom, the bride's 
maiden name should be used, and also the prefix "Miss." 

No numerals should be used, but hours or dates should be spelled out 
in full.

INFORMATION OF VALUE 



Births 



ANNOUNCEMENTS. 

Birth announcements may be printed on four-page baronial (square) 
stationery, in such form as "Mr. and Mrs. James Robins Blanck announce the 
birth of their daughter Frances Marie on the Twenty-third of January, Nine- 
teen-nine." 

A more popular and attractive way is to have large square visiting cards 
bearing the names "Mr. and Mrs. James Robins Blanck" for a centre line, with 
the address at the bottom. Cards about one-sixth the size of these bear the 
name of the infant in the centre, with the date of birth spelled out in full at 
the bottom. The two cards are punched in the upper left-hand corner, and 
tied together with delicate pink or blue baby ribbon, the little card on top. 
These are mailed out in heavy card envelopes in which they fit snugly.

POINTS OF INTEREST. 

The space from Eleventh to Twelfth and from Chestnut to Market was 
first chosen by Stephen Girard for his famous college. In the year 1800 here 
stood an old yellow house surrounded by a peach orchard. After Girard's death 
it was concluded that the plot of ground was entirely too small, so the larger 
farm was purchased of Peel at Twenty-first and Ridge Road, where stands the 
present college, opened 1848. 

The old Swedes' Church, with surrounding graveyard, is one of the inter- 
esting spots of Philadelphia. It is located in Southwark, in the southeastern 
portion of Philadelphia, and was the hamlet of the Sven family, of Sweden, who 
settled here long before the location of Philadelphia was determined. They 
called the place Wiccaco, which was an old Indian name, meaning "a pleasant 
place." The first church was built in 1677; the present edifice in 1700, and the 
parsonage in 1737. 

At Ninth and Chestnut Streets stands the beautiful Philadelphia Post 
Office, which occupies the spot where formerly stood the University of Penn- 
sylvania, as founded by Franklin. 

This spot was also made the home of the President in 1800, but before it 
was finished John Adams came into office and refused to live there. The Uni- 
versity now stands at Thirty-fourth and Walnut Streets, having been removed 
there in 1875. 

At the southwest corner Seventh and Market, where the bank now 
stands, was the house wherein was drafted the Declaration of Independence 
by Thomas Jefferson.

46 PHILADELPHIA INFORMATION 

Horticultural and Memorial Halls in Fairmount Park are splendidly pre- 
served relics of the Centennial. 

The Philadelphia Museum, Thirty-fourth and Vintage Ave. (South St.), 
covers a space of 84,000 square feet, has the finest commercial and economic 
library in America — 40,000 volumes, an exhibit of the world's raw products; an 
immense exhibit of utensils, materials and ethnological objects illustrating the 
lives and conditions of more than fifty different races of savage peoples. More 
than ten carloads of Philippino materials from the St. Louis Exposition — open 
daily to the public. 

The space occupied from Seventh to Eighth and Walnut to Chestnut was 
the former site of the famous mansion of Robert Morris, who, after helping the 
Colonies in the great financial crisis, died in poverty. The great house built 
there, two stories high, had three sub-cellars. The whole structure was made 
of the finest marble, with most expensive sculpture and statuary. He was not 
able to finish the house, and this grand work of folly was taken down piece by 
piece and sold to other builders. Some of the subterranean passages still exist, 
they having been so deep as never to have been filled in by after owners. At 
the corner of Eighth and Chestnut lived Benedict Arnold. 

In Franklin Square, bounded by Race and Vine, Sixth and Seventh, on 
the little eminence toward the north, is the spot where Franklin stood to fly his 
kite in the interests of electric phenomena. 

Just opposite stands the Lutheran Church, wherein were held memorial 
services for Washington in 1799, at which time Richard Henry Lee, known as 
"Light Horse Harry," made use of the familiar phrase, "First in war, first in 
peace and first in the hearts of his countrymen." 

At 520 North Seventh Street, in the old house around the corner, lived 
Edgar Allan Poe during the writing of some of his weird poems. 

The first American flag was made by Betsy Ross in the house still 
standing at 239 Arch Street. 

Bartram's Gardens, at Fiftieth and Woodland Avenue, is a most inter- 
esting spot. 

From the sweet odor arising from a clod of earth, crushing a bunch of 
English white violets, while Bartram was plowing in England, he was led to 
study into the history of the violet. 

He found this story, that "while Apollo was playing at quoits with his 
son, one of the quoits accidentally struck the son's head, who fell to the earth 
dead. Each drop of blood that sank into the ground sprang up a bunch of 
beautiful, sweet-scented violets." Thus the beauty and fragrance of the violet 
were bought with the price of blood. 

The mythological story so inspired him that he studied other flowers 
and subsequently became the greatest botanist in the world. 

He migrated to Philadelphia and bought the farm on the banks of the 
Schuylkill. Here he lived in comparative seclusion, planting here and there 
over his place shrubbery from every part of the globe, many of which trees 
may be seen at the present time. 

The old house still stands, as erected in 1732, and the old wine press 
and numerous other features of interest add to the pleasure of the student. 

Bartram's works are looked upon to-day as standard in our best schools. 

Christ Church, Second above Market. 

The State House at Fifth and Chestnut, also Carpenter's Hall, a short 
distance below, must, of course, be visited.

48 PHILADELPHIA INFORMATION 

The Rush Library at Broad and Christian Streets had its foundation by 
Dr. Rush and was endowed with about $2,000,000. This is about the same as 
the original endowment of Girard College. The present Aldine Hotel was 
the former home of Madam Rush, in whose honor this library was founded bj 
her husband. It is a beautiful work of art, containing some of the rarest man- 
uscripts, but no fiction, and as a result is little visited by the public to-day. 

Interesting modern spots. Cramps' Shipyards, League Island, Baldwin's 
Locomotive Works, Zoological Gardens, City Hall, new Mint.

You Can Make Toast 

on a GAS RANGE, GASOLINE or OIL STOVE better 
than it can be made on a coal stove if you use 

The Vulcan Toaster 

It is so easy to operate. Place the Vulcan over the flame; wait thirty seconds for the Toaster 
to heat; put on the bread, and in two minutes four slices are ready to serve. 

And, Oh, such toast as it is! Beautifully browned; not a charred spot. The outside crisp 
and snappy, while the inside is soft, and as sweet as a nut. Why, even the dyspeptic, who hesitates 
at every mouthful, would make a meal on this toast. But you must have THE VULCAN to make 
this kind of toast. 

When you buy a toaster ask for the VULCAN by name. See that it has the narrow strip of 
unperforated metal to prevent burning in the centre, and see that the name "VULCAN" is on the top. 

If your dealer does not keep the VULCAN, send fifty-cents in stamps to DEPT. N. W., and 
we will send you a toaster by express, prepaid. 

OUR GUARANTEE 

Use the VULCAN for ten days. If you are not entirely satisfied at the end of that time we 
will cheerfully refund your money.

THE 

Store of Famous Shoes 

It is a new and decidedly radical idea in the retail- 
ing of Shoes. 

It has put the shoe business upon a basis where 
everybody can clearly understand what they are pay- 
ing their money for, and why. 

It demands that the name of the real manufacturer 
be stamped on every shoe in the store, thus making 
him responsible for any shortcomings in the service of 
his products. But, at the same time, it has carefully 
sought out only those whose national reputations pre- 
cluded any deviation of quality. 

It exalts the fitting of shoes to a profession. Sales-persons 
are chosen here for their experience in the scientific fitting of 
feet, and their ability to advise. 

In short, it offers to the public, America's most FAMOUS 
SHOKS in every type of service, at every price, professionally 
fitted, all under one roof. Can you wonder that it has leaped 
into instantaneous popularity ? 

Among the Famous makes that make up our vast stock for Men, 
Women and Children, are " Queen Quality," Garside, Wichert CS. 
Gardner, " Luxura," etc., for Women; " Bostonian," "Pennsy," M. 
C&> K., Banister, Edwin Clapp for Men; "Little Wonder Arch Form," 
" King," "Iron Clad," etc., for Children, Girls and Boys. 

Famous Shoes cost no more than ordinary kinds. Men 's, $3 
upwards, Women 's $3 upwards, Children 's $ 1 .25 upwards

When You Rent or Buy 
a House 

When buying or renting a house anywhere in 
Philadelphia, be sure that it is wired and equipped for 
Electric Light. Modern houses, large and small, are 
being wired now-a-days — you can find them in every 
section of the city. 

Up-to-date builders are even placing electrical ap- 
paratus in the laundry and the kitchen, without ad- 
ditional charge to purchasers. 

Hundreds of Two Story Houses 

in West Philadelphia are now using Electricity, which 
is the best possible proof of its economy. Why not 
make housekeeping comfortable and convenient? 

Remember that if it isn't Electric 
it isn't Modern

Department of Home 



OWNING. — If the man of the new family feels that he is permanently 
located in this city, there is no city in the whole country where he can own his 
own home to better advantage than in this city of homes. First, select the 
general neighborhood that you want to live in, then select the exact location 
and buy a lot and have your house built, or select one in process of building 
rather than one completed. By doing this you can at least have some of the 
finishing to suit your individual taste. 

EXTERIOR. — Be chary of running to extremes in seeking for novelties 
in the exterior of your house. An odd feature may be attractive at first, but it 
is very apt to prove unsuitable, and the chances are you will tire of it, when to 
remove or alter it will be expensive and troublesome. It is better to be con- 
ventional in the general outlines than to go too far in an effort to have your 
house different from any other. It does not follow that no novelty should be 
permitted. Indeed, you will hardly want your house to be just like your 
neighbors' dwellings, whether in city or village. You can easily avoid this 
without adopting a grotesque design or strange ornamentation. In doing 
this you will escape the error in taste of making your home too conspicuous. 
There is a becoming modesty in the appearance of a dwelling quite as much 
as in the dress of a woman. 

It costs no more to have your home beautiful, both in the exterior and 
interior, than to have it ugly. It is not the money spent upon a house that 
makes it a success. It is the cunning grouping of design, material, and 
surroundings into one harmonious picture. Far too often the money spent in 
seeking to make a house handsome is worse than wasted in ornamentation 
which spoils the beauty of a really good design. 

The architect should be an artist as well as a designer. 

If your house is meant to be a real home rather than a mere residence, 
see that it is substantial. Nothing does more to enrich and build up the 
communities than the love and attachment for the locality of men and women 
whose early homes were there and who look upon the old homesteads as the 
most valued of all their possessions. Remember this when you build your 
house, and do your share toward developing the attachment to locality which 
is too often missing in the American character. 

In the purely commercial view, it pays to build substantial houses. It 
is a poor investment to put poor material and poor workmanship into a house. 
If you should desire to sell the property at any time, you will find it hard 
to get a return of the original cost, or you will have to be content with a 
smaller increase in value than neighboring, but better built, property shows. 
If you retain the house, the cost of constant repairs, made necessary by its 
poor construction, will prove a heavy burden and very soon reach beyond the 
money it would have cost to have built it in a substantial way. The better 
built the house the less fuel it will take to heat it in winter and the cooler 
it will be in summer.

80 DEPARTMENT OF HOME 

Do not forget, however, that the very best constructed dwelling cannot 
be long neglected without falling into a bad condition. The wear and tear 
a house suffers from the elements and its occupants never ceases a moment, 
and every house must have constant care if it is to be kept in prime condition. 
Watch the little defects as they appear. If you promptly cure them, the 
expense will be little or nothing, and you will rarely have any big trouble to 
meet in the house-repairing line. 

INTERIOR DECORATING.— Let the same fear of too much ornamen- 
tation govern your ideas of the interior as of the exterior. Let the materials 
be of the best, and bear in mind that simplicity of details usually gives the 
truest artistic effects. Reject promptly any proposed oddity, the sole purpose 
of which is to make a show. If you let freak features into your house, you will 
likely soon tire of them. If you decide to sell the house, you must find a pur- 
chaser of exactly your own taste in such matters, or, perhaps, be unable to 
dispose of the property at as good a price as if undesired oddity were absent. 
In planning the interior of your house study well the requirements of your fam- 
ily and try to meet them to the greatest possible extent in the arrangement of 
rooms, closets, etc. Seek the best arrangement to reduce to a minimum the 
labor of the housekeeper. Avoid such an arrangement as will require the 
housewife to run up and down the stairs many times a day in conducting the 
ordinary duties of the household. Let the kitchen and dining-room be so lo- 
cated with reference to each other that meals may be conveniently served and 
unnecessary steps avoided. A small mistake of judgment in matters of this 
sort will often add serious burdens to the home life of wife and mother. 

FINISHING. — The finishing and decorating of the home should be, as 
should all mechanical work, left to those who are especially trained to it. Ex- 
perience has proven that in most cases there will be greater satisfaction if the 
owner's general ideas are given to the experienced artisan, and the details left 
to them to work out. You can only see the sample of paper, moulding, panel- 
ing or decoration, while his experience enables him to picture it as it will be 
when finished, and he can make it meet your ideas better than if you insist on 
the details. This method is surely safe when the work is given to some one 
of tried ability and taste. 

CELLAR. — Pay particular attention to your cellar. A vast amount of 
illness has been caused by improperly built cellars, and by improper care of 
those properly built. Your cellar must, first of all, be dry. Insist upon every 
precaution being taken by the builder to insure this condition. 

Then, see that the cellar has full and free ventilation. If it has windows, 
let them be so placed that they will admit good, fresh air. If it is windowless, 
let holes be made in the walls for ventilation. Fit them with gratings to 
keep out rats, cats, and other animals. 

Arrange coal and other fuel bins so that the fuel can be put in with 
the least labor and time. If the floor is concreted, have a chopping block set 
in the concrete near the wood bin. You will find it a convenience worth 
having in splitting kindling wood. 

If the house is heated by a furnace or hot-water heater in the cellar, 
build your vegetable and fruit storage bins, shelves and closets so that their 
contents may not be harmed by the heat. It is absurd to put away winter 
supplies where they will be spoiled by the surroundings; yet it is a mistake 
many householders make. Be careful whence the furnace draws its supply 
of air. Do not let it be taken from a dark cellar. See that the intake pipe 
communicates directly with the outside air.

82 DEPARTMENT OF HOME 

HEATING. — There is a wide range of methods of heating the home, 
from the fireplace to electricity, and almost all of them have at least something 
to recommend them. Cost, as well as utility, must be considered, as must 
also the location and surroundings of the house, the accessibility to fuel, the 
relative costs of the different fuels in the locality, the amount of space to be 
heated, the window exposure, etc., etc. The installation of a hot-air furnace 
is less expensive than steam or hot-water systems, but is less effective in 
keeping an even temperature and takes more fuel. Probably the majority of 
architects, builders and home owners who have had experience would say that 
the most economical, sanitary and satisfactory method of heating the home 
would be by means of an adequate hot-water system. Its installation would 
be expensive, but the saving in fuel would return the extra cost to you in a 
few years, to say nothing of greater comfort and less trouble. 

CONVERTIBLE ROOM.— A room on the first floor, which can be used 
on occasions as a bedroom, is not found in the majority of houses, but it is 
desirable in all. Such a room will often be found a great convenience in a case 
of sudden illness in the family, or when an invalid or an aged person, who 
would find going up stairs a task, is a guest. This room may be furnished 
with a folding bed, and when not occupied as a bedroom it can be used as a 
sewing or sitting room, or study room for the children. 

SICK ROOM. — The advantages of having a room which can be easily 
isolated from the rest of the house in case of the appearance of a contagious 
disease are so great that you should provide for such a room in planning your 
home. This room should be in the upper part of the house, with a southern 
exposure, if possible. It should be well lighted, but the windows should have 
dark shades, so that sunlight can be shut out if need be. Special care should 
be taken to have the room well ventilated. 

This "hospital room" should be provided with hot and cold water 
facilities, if you can do so, and a bath and toilet room should be convenient. 
In whatever way the house is heated the room should have a fireplace and 
grate. A grate fire is often the most desirable for heating a sick room, and it 
is a very important factor in proper ventilation. It goes without saying that 
the "hospital room" need not be reserved exclusively for use in cases of 
contagious or other diseases. It ought to be one of the most bright and 
cheerful rooms in the house — too pleasant to be reserved for sickness. But it 
should be so arranged that it can be quickly transformed into a "hospital 
room" when the emergency arises. 

Build all bedrooms as large as the size of your house will permit. The 
evils of sleeping in small and unnecessarily "stuffy" bedrooms are many. It 
is better to sacrifice some other room than to cramp the space of your bed- 
rooms. Above all, have no dark bedrooms. Indeed, there should be no dark 
room of any kind. Bedrooms, especially, should be open to the germ-killing 
and health-giving rays of the sun every day. 

See that your plans and specifications call for "deadening" all the floors 
and the principal partitions in your house. It is annoying, unpleasant, and (in 
the case of illness) sometimes dangerous when floors and partitions are so 
constructed that the footfalls of a person walking on the floor above or his 
voice in an adjoining room can be plainly heard. The extra cost of providing 
against this is insignificant, while the resultant benefit and satisfaction are 
great.

84 DEPARTMENT OF HOME 

PLUMBING. — No single feature of your house should receive more 
careful attention than the plumbing. No matter how anxiously you may have 
to count every dollar your home costs, do not "skimp" in the plumbing work. 
"The best is the cheapest" applies to nothing more truly than to the sanitary 
appliances of your home. Do not let dollars count as against the health of 
your family. 

No family is safe if its home is contaminated with bad air from sewer 
or waste pipe. One imperfect joint, one improperly placed trap, one minute 
defect in a small pipe, may bring illness to every member of the household. 
Sewer gas is a most insidious enemy. It is silent, persistent and deadly. Its 
mischief is often wrought before its presence is suspected. Perfect plumbing 
is the one only way to ward off its attacks. 

Insist upon having the best material in all your plumbing arrangements, 
and that every appliance used be of the latest and most approved pattern. 
These will be of no value, however, without good workmanship. See to it 
that no part of the work of installing pipes and fixtures is slighted. Let the 
pipes be arranged, as far as the plan of the house will permit, so that they 
can be easily reached when repairs are necessary. 

It is a wise precaution to have all the plumbing tested at least once a 
year. Rats and mice, the "settling" of the house, or even the shaking it may 
receive from a severe gale, may affect the pipes, and the slightest defect should 
be attended to at once. 

BUILDING AND LOAN ASSOCIATIONS.— Building and loan asso- 
ciations are a highly important factor in the building of American homes. 
While the first known association of the kind was organized in Frankford, Pa., 
near Philadelphia, in 1831, the real growth and extension of the system has 
been almost wholly in recent years. By far the larger number of associations 
now in existence are less than twenty-five years old. How rapid and won- 
derful their growth has been is shown by the fact that the number in operation 
in 1900 was 5,485, with an aggregate membership of 1,512,685. These had 
assets reaching the enormous total of $581,866,170. These figures will have 
materially increased at the time of publishing this book. 

Exactly how many homes have been built by the means of these 
organizations cannot be told. The most reliable estimates, made by officers 
of the United States League of Building and Loan Associations, place the 
number at 661,325 in the eighteen years from 1883 to 1900, both inclusive. 
If each of these homes should be allowed a ground frontage of thirty feet, 
and ail were placed side by side in a line, the great row of dwellings would 
extend from Bangor, Me., to San Francisco, Cal., and one hundred and fifty- 
four miles on toward Hawaii. These figures take no account of the so-called 
"natural" associations, which are not regarded as true home builders, and, 
indeed, are repudiated by most of the local associations. 

It is a conservative estimate that 90 per cent, of these homes would 
not have been built without the help of the building and loan associations. 
In this fact lies the secret of their great value to the nation. Every new home 
established adds something to the material and moral welfare of the 
community and nation. More than half a million new homes in less than 
twenty years means an advance in the well-being of, at the very least, three 
million men, women and children, thus adding to their value to the State, both 
in increasing its wealth and in tending to make them better citizens.

86 DEPARTMENT OF HOME 

INSURANCE PROTECTION. 

TITLE. — With city property, at least, no home should be purchased 
without title insurance. This, like all other insurance, is very inexpensive 
when compared with the protection it gives. Before a title insurance com- 
pany will pass the title, all obstructions must be removed, and if any are so 
obscure that they miss the scrutiny of the examiners, the loss, if any, is payable 
by the insurance company. 

FIRE. — The cost of this protection is so very low that we do not hesi- 
tate to state that anyone who owns a home, or even those who own only the 
furnishings, are neglecting an imperative duty unless they secure it. No in- 
surance can be taken to make money by. It is only intended to help bear the 
loss, and many a family would have been bankrupt if the insurance money had 
not given them a new start. To expedite settlements in case of loss, everyone 
should keep an inventory of all their goods, noting the time purchased and the 
cost. These figures will be asked for in case of a fire, and memory is never 
entirely dependable, and may cause serious delay or contests. Many persons 
have the erroneous idea that fire insurance protects only in case of total de- 
struction. This is not so, as any loss by accidental fire is payable by the 
insurance company. 

LIFE. — Every married man owes it to his wife to protect her from the 
loss she will suffer in the event of his death by the removal of his earnings. 
This is especially true of those buying a home. If the home is not paid for 
in full, enough life insurance should be carried to clear it in case of the hus- 
band's death, and if it is clear, the money coming in will enable her to keep 
it, in many cases where she otherwise would be compelled to sacrifice it. There 
are many forms of this valuable protection, and for the young married man 
we would recommend that he secure some of those which bring the burden 
of payments during the years of his greatest earning capacity and leaving his 
declining years protected, but free from outlay. 

ACCIDENT. — While accidents are comparatively few, and a person 
may pay premiums for years without receiving any back, it must be kept in 
mind that the amount of money received in almost any one accident will prob- 
ably repay all the outlay in premiums for many years. 

OTHER. — We consider all insurance protection in the light of money 
well invested. Your plate glass may be protected, you may be insured against 
burglars, your health may be insured, and anything particularly valuable may 
be protected.

APPLES. 



BAKED. — Wipe and core without peeling. Place in baking pan and 
stuff cores with sugar, and spices if desired. Cover the bottom of the pan 
with water. Bake until soft, basting often with syrup from pan. 

FRIED. — Clean and core firm cooking apples; cut in slices a quarter 
inch thick, across the core. Have the fat hot; brown and turn. Sprinkle 
sugar on the brown side. This will melt by the time the other side is brown. 

FRITTERS. — Dissolve one teaspoonful of salaratus in a pint of sour 
milk, add three beaten eggs, and enough flour to make soft batter; pare and 
core six apples and chop or grind, and mix in. Fry like doughnuts. 

SAUCE. — Use rather tart apples, pare and slice, place in water to cover; 
cook until tender, sweeten to taste, and beat or mash all lumps. 

WATER. — An excellent, mildly purgative food drink is made as 
follows: Pare, core and slice juicy apples; add enough lemon rind to flavor; 
add teaspoonful of sugar for each apple; place in jug and add a cup of 
boiling water for each apple. Strain after cooling. 



ASPARAGUS. 

This garden vegetable is a very strong purgative for the kidneys. Cut 
off all dry ends and peel off the tough outer skin from the bottom of the stem. 
Put in lukewarm salted water and boil quickly. When tender, serve hot, with 
pepper and drawn butter.

BISCUIT. 

Take two cups of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, three teaspoonfuls of 
baking powder, two tablespoons of butter, lard or cottolene, enough milk to 
make soft dough. Sift the dry parts together, add shortening and mix; then 
add milk gradually, work into dough, roll out to about a quarter-inch thick, 
place in floured baking pan, brush over with milk, and bake in hot oven from 
ten to fifteen minutes. 

BEEF. 

BOILED. — The less expensive cuts may be used for this purpose. Cut 
in pieces of not over a half-pound each, season to taste and boil slowly for 
two hours or more, keeping the meat covered with water. Carrots, potatoes 
or dumplings may be boiled at the same time. 

CROQUETTES. — Take cuttings or left-over of steak or roasts; grind 
or mince; add beaten egg to make an adhesive paste; season to taste; flavor 
with thyme, sage or parsley; shape into cones; roll in egg and cracker dust, 
and fry in pan of hot grease. Serve with green peas, garnished with parsley 
sprays. 

ESSENCE. — Take lean, juicy meat; mince or grind and place in jar. 
Set jar in stew pan of cold water and boil slowly for three or four hours. 
Press and strain the meat before cooling and season highly. 

LOAF. — An excellent method of using surplus meat is as follows: Take 
half cooked meat and half raw; mince or grind; mix egg until it holds together; 
make into loaf; coat the top with egg for browning; bake in slow oven for 
about a half-hour. 

POT ROAST. — Take rump, round or rolled shoulder; sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, place in pot with an inch or two of water and a tablespoonful 
of vinegar. Boil until nearly dry. If not done to suit, add a cupful of hot 
water and boil down again. When done allow to boil dry, and turn as 
browned. Meat cooked in this way should not wait on table, as it loses its 
deliciousness when cool.

92 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

ROAST. — The best roasting pieces are the ribs or saddle, the top of 
the sirloin or the top round. Wash and trim carefully, and rub pepper and 
salt into the surface. Place in roasting pan and cook in hot oven from fifteen 
to twenty minutes for each pound. Baste often with the drippings, and when 
the outside is well browned, reduce the heat. Add hot water if the fat burns. 
When done serve hot. The brown juices in the pan make excellent gravy. 
Add flour and hot water and season. 

SCRAPED. — Take lean beef and scrape with dull knife. Press the 
pulp through a coarse sieve. Mix with beef tea or essence to make a very 
strong food. 

STEAK, BROILED.— Broiling steak should be cut at least an inch 
thick. Wipe with damp cloth and place in greased broiler with outside of 
cut nearest the handle. Broil over clear coals, turning continuously for a 
few minutes and then slower until browned. Rare steak will be cooked 
properly in five to eight minutes, and twelve to fifteen minutes will broil well 
through. Place on a hot platter, spread with butter and sprinkle with salt 
and pepper. 

STEW, WITH DUMPLINGS.— The upper part of the shin, with bone, 
makes excellent stew. Cut the meat in one to two-inch pieces, wipe with 
damp cloth and sprinkle with flour and salt. Brown the meat in a frying pan 
with a little fat. Place in kettle with cracked or sawed bone, add salt, pepper 
and bay leaf, and the essence from the frying pan. Cover with water and 
boil for five minutes, then cook slowly on back of stove for two hours. Add 
peeled onions, carrots, turnips and potatoes cut in half-inch cubes, and cook 
for another hour. Take one pint of flour, three teaspoonfuls of baking 
powder, one teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful of shortening; add milk to 
make a soft dough, mix and roll out and cut into dumplings. Drop into 
stew and cook ten minutes longer. 

TEA. — Cut lean, juicy meat in small pieces and cover with cold water 
for an hour. Then simmer slowly for three or four hours in covered pan; 
add plenty of salt and a little pepper. Strain off the juice, avoiding all 
particles of meat. If too thick, thin with hot water. 

BREAD. 

BOSTON BROWN.— Take one cup of yellow corn meal, one cup of 
rye meal, one cup of Graham flour, one tablespoonful of soda, same of salt, 
three-quarters cup of molasses, two cups of thick, sour milk or buttermilk. 
Mix and sift dry ingredients, add molasses and milk; mix and beat well, and 
pour into well-greased pail. Cover the pail and place in a kettle of water 
half way up. Cover all and steam for three hours, adding water as it boils 
away. Then open the pail and dry the top of the loaf in the oven. 

CORN. — Take a pint of corn meal, shortening about the size of an egg, 
one teaspoonful of salt, one tablespoonful of cream of tartar, one beaten egg, 
one teaspoonful of dissolved soda, and milk enough to make heavy batter. 
Mix thoroughly and bake in greased pan in hot oven for about a half-hour. 
If buttermilk is used, do not use cream of tartar. 

GINGER BREAD. — Mix two pounds of flour and a half ounce car- 
bonate of magnesia, then add a large cup of molasses, half a pound of pow- 



DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 93 

dered sugar, three tablespoonfuls of melted butter and two drachms tartaric 
acid solution. Make a stiff paste and add a teaspoonful each grated nutmeg 
and cinnamon. Mix well, let stand for an hour, and bake slowly. 

GRAHAM. — Take one pint milk, one pint water, a half-cup of molasses, 
one tablespoonful salt, one-half yeast cake, one quart white flour and three 
pints graham flour. Scald the milk and add the water, molasses and salt. 
Cool and add dissolved yeast cake, and mix well with both flours. Let rise, 
beat and place in greased pans. Baking will increase the size of loaf to almost 
double. 

HEALTH. — Take one pint each, milk and water, one tablespoonful salt, 
a half-cup sugar, one-half yeast cake, five cups whole wheat flour, about three 
cups white flour. Mix and beat instead of kneading. When risen, beat out air, 
pour into greased pans, and when risen to nearly double size, bake for an 
hour in hot oven. 

RYE. — Make same as Health bread, substituting rye flour for whole 
wheat flour. 

STALE. — No particle of bread should be wasted except scraps of pieces 
partly eaten. Crusts should be well dried and grated, or rolled into crumbs 
for use in frying chops, cutlets, oysters, eggplant, etc. Stale bread should 
be saved and used in bread puddings, which are economical and delicious. (See 
puddings.) 

WHITE. — Take one quart warm water (or milk), about five quarts 
flour, one cup yeast. Mix yeast and liquid with enough of the flour to make a 
wet dough, and set to rise in cool place in summer and warm in winter. When 
risen to double the original size, add remaining flour and mould into loaves, 
kneading thoroughly. Place in greased pans and set to rise again, then bake 
in hot oven for about three-quarters of an hour. When baked take out of pans 
and wrap in clean cloth until cold. For those who like the taste, one cup of 
either cream mashed potatoes or corn meal will help to keep bread moist for 
a day or two longer. 

WHOLE WHEAT.— See Health bread. 



BEANS. 

BAKED. — Pick over and wash one quart navy or pea beans, cover with 
cold water and set to soak over night. Next day, drain and boil slowly until 
soft but not bursting. Then drain off and put in bean-pot or crock. Scald 
and scrape a half-pound of pork and cut in half-inch strips. Cover the pork 
in the beans. Mix one tablespoonful of salt, a half-tablespoonful of mustard, 
one-third cup of molasses and two cups of hot water, and pour over beans. 
Cover and bake slowly for seven or eight hours. Add water if needed. 
Uncover and place pork on top until brown. Beans will be whiter if sugar 
is used instead of molasses. 

BOILED. — Pick over and wash the beans, drain, and soak over night. 
Drain off and boil slowly until soft enough to pierce with a pin. Add very 
thin slices of pork, salt and celery seed. Keep covered with water and 
leave on back of stove for two hours. When dished, add butter and dashes 
of pepper. 



94 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

LIMA. — Shell, wash and boil in water just covering the beans for one 
hour. Add salt when half done. When dished add butter and pepper 

STRING. — Carefully remove all strings and cut or break in one-inch 
lengths. Use little water, and serve with the beans. Season the same as Lima 
beans. A piece of fat pork cooked with the beans will take the place of 
butter and will be less expensive. 

BEETS. 

BOILED. — Wash the beets, but do not pare them. Boil for two or 
three hours. Drain and put in cold water while hot, to loosen skins. Peal 
and cut in cross slices about one-eighth to one-quarter inch thick. Season to 
taste. 

BUTTERED. — Take boiled beets sliced, place a tablespoonful of butter 
to each pint of beet slices and put in oven in serving dish until butter is 
melted through. 

PICKLED. — Take boiled beets, sliced, place in layers in crock or jar, 
with bay leaves, cloves and cinnamon sprinkled between layers. Cover with 
vinegar and let stand for three or four days. 



BUCKWHEAT CAKES. 

Sift together two cups of buckwheat flour, one cup of white flour, one 
teaspoonful of salt, three teaspoonfuls of baking powder, and one table- 
spoonful of sugar. Beat one egg and mix with two cups of sweet milk, and 
add this to the dry mixture, beating well and keeping the batter free from 
lumps. Melt one tablespoonful of shortening and stir into batter. Drop on 
greased griddle by spoonfuls, and when brown under and bubbly on top, turn 
over and brown other side. Serve hot, with butter, sugar, molassses or maple 
syrup. 

CAKE. 

BRIDE. — Take one pound of butter, ten ounces brown and same of 
granulated sugar, ten well-beaten, good-sized eggs, three pounds of cleaned 
and chopped raisins, three pounds well-cleaned currants, two pounds preserved 
citron, cut fine, twenty ounces sifted flour, one teaspoonful mace, two nutmegs 
and a half-pint sherry wine with ten drops of oil of lemon in it. Soften the 
butter and stir to a cream, add the sugar and stir until light. Add the beaten 
yolks of the eggs. Beat the whites to a froth and add. Stir in the flour, then 
the spices, then the fruit, and last the citron. Bake in plain round tins, 
greased with butter, until a piece of straw will come out clean. Buttered 
paper in the pan will often enable you to bake a cake more thoroughly with- 
out burning the outside. 

CHOCOLATE. — Rub four tablespoonfuls of butter into two cups of 
sugar, beat whites and yolks of four eggs separately and add. Pour in one 
cup of sweet milk, and stir in three cups of flour into which one teaspoonful 
of cream of tartar has been sifted. Melt a half-teaspoonful of soda in hot 
water and add. Bake in buttered jelly cake or pie tins. Fill between the

sugar, one cup of milk, seven eggs, three teaspoonfuls of baking powder, one 
teaspoonful of salt, three teaspoonfuls of cinnamon and half a nutmeg. 
Mix well and stir in six cups of flour until the dough is fairly firm. Then stir 
in one pound of cleaned raisins, half a pound of sliced citron, half a pound of

added if desired. Bake in buttered pans two to three inches deep for two 
hours in a slow oven. 

JELLY. — Soften a pound of butter and stir to a cream, add one pound 
of granulated sugar, the yolks of ten eggs, and twelve ounces of sifted flour. 
Beat whites of eggs to a froth and add. Bake in buttered plates, and when cool 
spread jelly between each layer. 

MARBLE. — Soften and beat to a cream four tablespoonfuls of butter. 
Work in one cup of sugar. Mix two and a half teaspoonfuls of baking powder 
with two cups of flour and sift in. Beat yolks of two eggs and mix with one 
cupful of milk, stir this in and add a half-teaspoonful extract of vanilla. Last 
add whites of eggs beaten stiff. Beat well and divide into two even parts. 
Color one part by mixing one teaspoonful of melted chocolate or cocoa. Mix 
the light and dark when putting in pan. Bake for a half-hour in shallow, 
greased and floured pans. 

ORANGE. — Bake layers as for chocolate cake and fill with the follow- 
ing: Mix two-thirds cup of sugar with one-eighth teaspoonful salt, two and

separately. Then add a half-teaspoonful soda dissolved in hot water and 
one teaspoonful of mixed cloves, nutmeg and cinnamon. Just before baking, 
add one pound seeded and cut raisins, and beat very hard. Bake in small 
loaves, in moderate oven. 

SUGAR. — Beat whites and yolks of seven eggs separately. Beat well 
together and mix in one pound of powdered sugar and a half-pound melted 
butter. Sift in enough flour to roll out to a half-inch thick and cut into cakes. 
Bake in lightly greased pans, in hot oven. 

SPONGE. — Mix six beaten yolks, one cup of sifted flour, one and a 
half cups of granulated sugar and one teaspoonful baking powder. Add the 
beaten whites, juice of one lemon and yeast. Stir as little as possible to have 
it smooth. Bake in thin layers in hot oven. Buttered white paper in the pans 
is advisable, to prevent burning and sticking. 



CANDY. 

CHOCOLATE ALMONDS.— Blanch the almonds by pouring boiling 
water over them. Let stand for a few minutes, then roast. Take half a pound 
of sweet vanilla chocolate or pure cocoa powder and add two tablespoonfuls 
boiling water. Place chocolate in saucepan in hot water and when melted add 
an even tablespoonful of butter. Mix well and add water or cocoa until it 
just runs smoothly. Dip the roasted almonds in the coating and drop on 
waxed paper. 

CREAM CHOCOLATE CARAMELS.— Mix half a pint of granulated 
sugar, same of molasses, same of thick cream, one tablespoonful butter and a 
quarter-pound cooking chocolate or cocoa powder in an enameled saucepan. 
Cook until it will harden in ice water, stirring often. Pour into buttered tins 
until almost an inch thick. When nearly cold, cut in squares. Keep cool 
until hardened. 

CHOCOLATE FRUIT FUDGE.— Make like other fudge. After re- 
moving from fire, but before pouring out, add two chopped figs, an ounce of 
raisins, half a cup of English walnuts and one teaspoonful vanilla. Mix thor- 
oughly through, and then pour out to cool. 

CHOCOLATE MACAROONS.— Beat the whites of seven eggs to a 
paste, add ten ounces of pulverized sugar, a half-pound of grated almonds and 
a tablespoonful of pure cocoa powder. Lay out on round wax papers, press a 
blanched almond on the top of each and bake in a moderate oven. 

FONDANT. — Cover a pound of granulated sugar with water and allow 
to stand for half an hour. Add a pinch of cream of tartar and stir over the 
fire until sugar is dissolved. Then boil very slowly until a little dropped into 
cold water will become workable, like putty. Turn out on a cold platter and 
work until creamy. If brittle, it is too much cooked and must have water 
added and be boiled a little more. Keep several hours before using. This 
makes a wholesome body for home-made candies and may be worked about 
nuts, grapes or fruits, or coated with chocolate. 

RAW FONDANT. — Mix pulverized sugar with beaten white of egg and 
water, and work to the proper constituency.

CREAM DATES. — Split the dates and remove the pits. Insert raw 
fondant and close again. Rinse in cold water to remove stickiness. 

COCOANUT CANDY. — Put the milk of one cocoanut into two pounds 
of sugar and bring to a boil. Then add the grated meat of the cocoanut and 
cook until the particles are tender. Pour into buttered pans, and cut in squares 
before it hardens. 

BUTTER SCOTCH. — Boil one cupful each of sugar, butter and mo- 
lasses until it hardens when dropped into cold water. Pour in buttered pans, 
not over a quarter of an inch thick, and mark in small squares. 

HOME-MADE WHITE MOLASSES.— For Candy Pulls. Take three 
pounds of granulated sugar, and two quarts of clear golden syrup. Boil in 
copper or porcelain pot until a drop in cold water will become brittle. Then 
pour into greased platter, and when cool enough to handle, pull over hook 
until it strings smoothly, is light and airy, and glistens like polished silver. 
Flour the hands from time to time to prevent sticking. When well pulled, 
roll in three-quarter-inch rope and cut in one or two-inch lengths. 

CHOCOLATE FUDGE.— Mix two cups of granulated sugar, one table- 
spoonful of butter, one-half cup of rich new milk or cream and a half-cup of 
powdered cocoa or a little more grated cooking chocolate. Place in smooth 
saucepan and heat to the boiling point, stirring occasionally until the sugar 
is melted. Cook without stirring for seven to ten minutes. Tried in water, it 
will make a soft ball when done. When cooked, add vanilla or other flavor 
and beat until creamy. Then pour into greased pans, and score the top in 
one-inch squares. 

CABBAGE. 

Wash and cut all the course stalks from each outside leaf; cut the cab- 
bage in quarters and boil for a half hour, or until tender. Drain and serve as 
nearly whole as possible. Corned beef or ham, when cooked with it, give it a 
delicious flavor. Serve with vinegar or a vegetable sauce. 



CATSUPS. 

COLD. — Boil a half-peck of tomatoes and drain four hours. Mix the 
following with the tomato pulp: One cup of grated horseradish, one-half cup 
of white mustard seed, same of black mustard seed, one cup of sugar, half-cup 
of salt, two tablespoonfuls of celery seed, two tablespoonfuls of black pepper, 
same of cinnamon, half-tablespoonful of red pepper, one tablespoonful of 
ground cloves and one quart of vinegar. Mix very thoroughly. If too hot to 
suit taste, add more tomatoes. 

GRAPE. — Rub one gallon ripe concord grapes through strainer. Add 
one tablespoonful each of cloves, cinnamon and allspice, a half-teaspoonful red 
pepper and one pint of vinegar. Boil for about thirty minutes, stirring often; 
cool and bottle. If grapes are hard, parboil until soft. 

TOMATO. — Take a half-bushel ripe tomatoes, wash, cut in pieces and 
boil until soft. When cool enough to handle, rub through strainer. Add to 
the strained pulp one cup of salt, one cup of ground cloves, one cup of ground 
allspice, and one quart of pure cider vinegar. Boil for one hour, stirring often; 
cool and bottle. If too thick, thin with vinegar. 



DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 101 

CARROTS. 

BOILED. — Wash carrots and scrape or scrub with stiff brush. Cut in 
halves if small, or quarters if large. Boil until soft in salted water. Drain 
well, cut in thin slices or small cubes, sprinkle with pepper and salt, and spread 
with butter or white sauce. 

CARVING. 

FISH. — Any fish large enough to make more than one portion may 
be carved to advantage, so that most of the bones may be removed without 
serious waste, and the guests served with a more inviting dish. Lay the fish 
on the side and cut through close to the back bone. Remove the spine and 
trim out the small bones at the root of the back fins. This leaves the two 
halves with no bones in them except the ribs. Cut to size and serve. 

MEAT. — To treat this subject in full and in a scientific manner would 
take a whole book, and all we can do here is to give a few general hints. Com- 
mon sense and sharp tools will usually insure creditable carving. A great 
deal depends on the persons served and the kind of meat. Steaks should be 
carved in long strips. Roasts should be sliced thin and as nearly directly 
across the grain of the meat as possible. Boiled meats are usually too soft 
to carve well, and should be rather pulled apart, but no piece should be 
served in which the grain of the meat is over an inch long. Where possible, 
all bone should be removed. 

POULTRY. — Roast poultry is much more easily carved since the ad- 
vent of the poultry shears. First remove the wings and the legs and thighs. 
This leaves the body of the fowl so that it may be turned in any position to 
afford the best slicing. A lighter carver may be used than for meat, but a dull 
knife is apt to mean disaster. 

CAULIFLOWER. 

BOILED. — Select clean, firm heads and cut away all the leaves. Pull 
the flowers off in pieces and boil in salted water until soft. Drain, dish and 
spread with butter or cream sauce. 

BAKED. — Clean and bcil until tender. Break and lay a layer in the 
bottom of a dish. Cover with butter, bread crumbs and a little grated cheese. 
Then add other layers treated in this way until the dish is full. Cover top well 
with crumbs and bake to a rich brown. 



CELERY. 

This excellent vegetable should be cleaned very thoroughly. The best 
way to do this is to remove all leaves, and scrub the stalks lengthwise with a 
stiff brush. Cut in half-inch to inch lengths, boil until tender, drain and serve 
in drawn butter. 

CEREALS. 

These foods are cheap, easy to prepare, and very rich in nutrition. 
Although manufacturers are placing on the market many partly cooked 



102 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

cereals, they should be well cooked on account of their starchy nature. The water 
should be boiling and well salted, and the cereal stirred in with a fork until 
thick, keeping in mind the fact that it will thicken more while cooking and 
cooling. Boil for five minutes and then cover and steam slowly for fifteen 
minutes to half an hour. Stir occasionally to prevent sticking. 

CHEESE, COTTAGE. 

Do not throw away sour milk. Set it above the stove or in a warm 
place until the curds and whey separate. Pour into cheese-cloth bag, drain 
until fairly dry, mix with cream, pepper and plenty of salt. If liked best dry, 
use no cream, season with sage, work in salt and butter and serve in individual 
platters. 

CHOPS. 

These pieces of meat come to the housekeeper in size for cooking, and 
should be carefully cleaned by close trimming and careful wiping with a damp 
cloth. Great care should be used to avoid under-cooking, which is a common 
failing, especially where breaded. Veal and pork chops are positively unwhole- 
some unless cooked through, and often cause bowel trouble. Where chops 
are rich in natural fats, the juices should be drained off and used for gravy. 

CHOWDER. 

CLAM. — Take one quart of clams, add one cup cold water; lift clams 
out separately, rinsing each in the juice. Cut two ounces of salt pork in small 
pieces and try out in frying pan. Peel, chop and fry one good-sized onion in 
the pork fat until brown. Pare and chop five potatoes, chop the hard part 
of the clams, and place in pot with onions, pork fat, clam juice and three cups 
of boiling water. Boil until potatoes are nearly soft, add the soft part of 
clams, one heaping teaspoonful of salt, pepper to taste, and one tablespoonful 
of butter. Cook again for five minutes and add one quart of hot milk. Pour 
this in large dish in which about ten soda crackers have been softened in cold 
milk. 

FISH. — Chop two pounds of fresh fish, four potatoes, one large onion, 
and five or six ounces of salt pork or bacon. Try out fat and treat onions as 
in clam chowder. Pour the fat into saucepan, put in layer of fish. Salt and 
pepper to taste. Repeat layers until all in. Cover with water and boil for 
a half hour. Add butter, and serve like clam chowder. 

CLAMS. 

DEVILED. — Heat and skim the juice of twenty-five clams. Rub a 
teaspoonful each of flour and butter together until creamy. Melt this with 
the juice and stir until like a gruel. Chop the clams and throw out the gristle. 
Add this to gruel and cook five minutes, stirring continuously. Season highly 
with salt, pepper, sage and parsley. Fill into clean shells, dip in bread crumbs 
and bake in hot oven twenty minutes. 

STEWED. — Drain off the juice and heat slowly in pan. Add pepper and 
butter, and cream. Stew until hot and add the clams. Cook for about three 
minutes, remove and serve at once.

COCOA. 

Take one small teaspoonful cocoa powder, and mix well with one and 
a half teaspoonfuls of granulated sugar. Add enough cream to make a smooth 
paste and add hot milk. The richest drink is made in individual cups as above. 
Cocoa is a particularly rich, invigorating and healthful food drink. 



CODFISH. 

SALT. — Soak over night in cold water, drain and cover with warm 
water. When cold, drain again, cover with warm water and allow to simmer 
for two hours. Remove bones and skin and serve in individual dishes with 
boiled potato, both covered with drawn butter. 

CAKES. — Take equal parts of mashed potato and shredded fish, add a 
little cream; work into small cakes and float in hot lard until brown. Drain 
and serve hot, with horseradish and parsley. 



COFFEE. 

EFFECTS. — Coffee is a mild brain stimulant and an aid to digestion, 
provided it is used in moderation, and not too strong. It should not be given 
to growing children unless very weak. Its effects are cheering, strengthening 
and invigorating, and yet it is a thing to be careful of, for an excess of its 
effects is bad in many ways. 

FLAVOR. — High-grade blends of coffee make excellent flavoring, and 
are very tasty. It can be used to good advantage in cakes, ice cream, corn 
starch, biscuit, gelatines, etc., etc. To make the flavoring, pulverized coffee 
should be steeped for about one hour and then boiled for about one minute. 
Cool and then strain. 

HEALTH. — An excellent health coffee may be made by taking equal 
parts of wheat, rye, barley and sweet potatoes cut into quarter-inch cubes. 
Place these in a dry roasting pan and parch in the oven, stirring often to 
prevent charring. Grind and make like coffee. 



COOKING RECIPES. 

See Index of Information to locate the desired recipe in the Department 
of Cooking and Foods. 

COLD DRINKS. 

Iced drinks should be used in moderation. They are so tempting in hot 
weather that we are apt to use too much and chill the stomach so that it does 
not perform its proper functions. Acid drinks are more satisfying to the thirst 
than sweet. Iced tea should be served with lemon. 

MINT WATER. — Take one pint of brook-mint leaves, wash well, put 
a layer in a quart jar and cover with sugar; repeat the layers until all in, and 
cover with apple vinegar. Allow this to stand for at least two weeks, until the 
juice becomes a syrup. When a year eld, it is better than when fresh. One 
tablespoonful in a glass of water makes a satisfying beverage.

106 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

CORN. 

BAKED. — Grate or cut one dozen ears of corn, or take two cans of fine 
cut corn, add three beaten eggs, two cups of rich milk, one teaspoonful of salt, 
one teaspoonful of sugar and a quarter-pound cheese, grated. Mix well 
together and place in baking crock or dish, sprinkling the top with cheese and 
black pepper and spreading on butter. Bake in hot oven for three-quarters 
of an hour. 

BOILED. — Husk, trim and remove all the silk from the ears and wash 
in cold water. Drop into boiling water in which has been placed one teaspoon- 
ful each of vinegar and salt for each dozen ears. Boil ten to fifteen minutes, 
or until tender. 

ROASTED. — Remove all husks but the two inside layers. Pull these 
out and trim and silk. Pull husks over and roast in hot oven for ten minutes, 
or until grains begin to shrivel. Spread with salt, pepper and butter and keep 
in warm place for five minutes. Serve with husks on to keep moist until eaten. 

CUSTARDS. 
APPLE. — Take sour apples; peel, wash, cover and cook in little water 
until tender. Place in deep baking dish, cover with plain custard, and bake 
for a half hour in slow oven. 

COCOANUT. — Add two ounces of fresh grated cocoanut, or twice as 
much shredded cocoanut to the plain custard, before baking. 

PLAIN. — Take one quart of rich milk, eight well-beaten eggs, a little 
salt, six ounces of sugar, vanilla or flavor to taste, fill in cups, and bake in hot 
oven until crust is rich brown. 

DANDELIONS. 

GREENS. — Wash through several waters to remove every particle of 
dirt and grit. Boil for an hour with salt pork, in water to cover. One-quarter 
as much of both young plantain and curly dock will make the greens sweeter 
and richer. When done, drain and add salt, pepper and butter. 

WINE. — Pour three quarts of boiling water over two quarts cleaned 
blossoms. Let stand for sixty hours, strain and add two teaspoonfuls of dry 
yeast and one cup of granulated sugar. Flavor with wintergreen, orange or 
lemon. 

DATES. 

This fruit is fast coming to its proper place as a food of recognized 
high value and excellent effect upon the digestive organs. While a very rich 
food, it is rather soothing and healing to the digestive tract, and aids in puri- 
fying the blood. Dates are cheap enough to be enjoyed by all and can be used, 
chopped, with any cereal. They also make an excellent pure confection by 
cutting lengthwise, removing the stone and filling the centre with nuts. Then 
press back to original shape and roll in powdered sugar. 

DESSERTS. 

See the following, in this department: — Cakes, Custards, Fruits, 
Gelatines, Ice Cream, Ices, Jellies, Junket, Pies and Puddings. 



DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 107 

DRESSINGS. 
CAPER SAUCE. — Pound a tablespoonful of fresh-boiled shrimps and a 
tablespoonful of capers; knead together three ounces of butter and a table- 
spoonful of baked flour and stir them into one-third of a pint of boiling water; 
add the pounded capers and shrimps, and a dessertspoonful of whole capers; 
boil for ten minutes and serve. 

CELERY SAUCE. — Cut some celery into quarter-inch lengths; fry it in 
butter until it begins to be tender, add a teaspoonful of flour, which may be 
permitted to brown, and a half-pint of good broth or beef-gravy; season with 
cayenne or black pepper, or other seasoning, as desired. 

DRAWN BUTTER.— Rub two teaspoonfuls of flour into one-quarter 
pound of butter; add five tablespoonfuls of cold water, or the water any 
vegetable, such as asparagus, has been cooked in; let it simmer until smooth. 
If for fish, chopped boiled eggs and capers may be added. If for boiled fowl, 
oysters may be put in while it is melting, and cooked through while it is 
simmering. 

PARSLEY SAUCE.— Wash a bunch of parsley in salted water; dip it 
twice into boiling water, and chop the leaves fine; knead a quarter pound of 
butter with a tablespoonful of baked flour, and stir in a third of a pint of water 
that a fowl has been cooked in; let it simmer five minutes; stir in a dessert- 
spoonful of chopped parsley; serve with fowl or fish. If with boiled fish, use 
the water the fish has been boiled in. 

MAYONNAISE SAUCE.— Take one yolk of a raw egg, some salt, 
pepper and a little raw mustard, mix these together with fork in large plate; 
add salad oil slowly, and guide the quantity used by the taste; mix by stirring 
one way until quite thick and smooth; then add vinegar enough to thin it a 
little, if there is any difficulty in getting the oil to mix. Add a few drops of 
vinegar from time to time and keep stirring. 

MINT SAUCE. — Look over and strip off the leaves of mint; then cut 
them as fine as possible with a sharp knife; use only the tender tips. To a cup- 
ful of chopped mint allow an equal quantity of sugar and half a cup of good 
vinegar. It should stand at least an hour before using. 

SALAD DRESSING. — Boil three fresh eggs for ten minutes; when cold, 
rub the yolks to a paste with a little pepper and salt, a teaspoonful of 
mustard, and a little sugar; mix in the beaten yolk of one egg; add by degrees 
four tablespoonfuls of salad oil; then, drop by drop, one and a half tablespoon- 
fuls of vinegar; serve at once. 

DRINKS. 

APPLE WATER.— See under "Apples" in this department. 

BARLEY WATER.— Wash one-eighth pound of pearl barley in three 
or four waters. Then add two quarts of boiling water, and boil half away. 
Drain, flavor with grated or sliced lemon peel and juice of an orange, and 
sweeten to taste. 

CRANBERRY TEA.— Wash and scald ripe cranberries, and let stand 
two hours. Strain, flavor with orange or lemon, and sweeten to taste. 

EGGNOG. — Beat an egg until light, add one teaspoonful of sugar, a 
little salt, and a half-cup of milk. Flavor with rum or brandy, mix well and 
serve in cups. 



108 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

FLAXSEED TEA. — Wash two ounces of flaxseed with cold water, add 
the grated peel of one lemon, and one quart of water. Keep hot, but not 
boiling, for two hours. Strain and sweeten to taste. 

FRUIT PUNCH. — Grate or slice thin one lemon peel, add one cup of 
sugar and two cups of water. Boil for ten minutes. Cool and add a half-cup 
of cold tea, juice of four oranges and five lemons. Strain and dilute to taste. 
Berries may be used in place of orange juice by washing, sprinkling with sugar 
and squeezing out the juice through a cheese-cloth bag. 

MINT WATER.— See under "Cold Drinks" in this department. 

EDIBLE MUSHROOMS. 

While we should not, in the slightest degree, detract from the danger 
that lies in gathering mushrooms by those who are not very well acquainted 
with them, we want our readers to know that a fear of the deadly kinds will 
deprive them of many enjoyable feasts. There are dozens of the fungi that 
have been proven in late years to be edible and delicious that were considered 
poisonous a few years ago. Any one who is fond of mushrooms can procure 
good books on the subject, and be able by their guidance to secure for them- 
selves many a delicious dish. Those who have studied carefully can find edible 
mushrooms right in the cities. 

EGGS. 

BOILED. — Place the eggs in water already boiling, and boil three 
minutes if wanted soft, or five minutes if wanted hard. Eggs boiled for twenty 
minutes are very easily digested, even by invalids, 

CREAMED EGGS. — Beat an egg slightly and add salt, pepper and a 
quarter cup of rich milk. Melt a teaspoonful of butter in saucepan over hot 
water, add the egg mixture and stir continuously until creamy. Remove 
before it starts to curdle. 

GRIDDLED. — Heat and grease griddle as for griddle cakes. Slip eggs 
on and leave until lightly browned on under sides and whites firm. Season 
while first side is browning, turn over and brown other side. 

MULLED. — Beat an egg lightly in a bowl. Boil one and a half cups of 
milk, sweeten and pour on the egg. Cut a slice of toast into small squares 
and drop in. Season to taste. 

OMELET. — Add four well-beaten eggs to one pint of new milk. Season 
and add one cup of smooth flour. Put equal parts of butter and lard in hot 
frying pan, stir in the egg mixture until thick, and bake to a light brown. 
Omelet must be eaten as soon as cooked to be at its best. 

POACHED. — Break the eggs carefully and drop, singly, into pan of 
hot, salted water. Dip the water over them while cooking. When whites are 
firm take up with skimmer, drain and serve on buttered toast. Season to taste. 

SCALLOPED. — Boil five or six eggs hard, chop and mix with white 
sauce. Butter a pan and sprinkle with bread crumbs. Then add a layer of 
egg, then bread crumbs, and so on until all in. Cover with crumbs and bake 
to an even light brown. 

SCRAMBLED. — Beat eggs slightly, add pepper, salt and a little chopped 
parsley, if desired, and enough milk to make thin. Pour into hot buttered 



DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 109 

frying pan and cook quickly, stirring continuously until firm, but light and 
soft. Serve hot, on buttered toast or slices of stale bread spread with olive oil. 

EGG PLANT. 
BAKED. — Peel the egg plant and cut out a piece from the top; dig out 
the centre, thus removing the seeds; fill the cavity with a dressing like that for 
ducks, and replace the top piece; bake an hour, basting with a spoonful of 
butter melted in a cup of hot water, and dredging with flour after each basting. 
It should be served as soon as possible after it is prepared. 

FRIED. — Pare and slice crosswise in quarter-inch slices. Dip alternately 
in bread crumbs and egg batter as in frying oysters. Fry in butter and ham 
or bacon fat. 

EGG PLANT FRITTERS.— Peel the egg plant and take out the seeds; 
boil it in well-salted water for an hour, mash fine and press all the water off 
through a coarse cloth, and mix in a fritter batter and fry. 

FATS. 

EFFECTS. — The effects of fats on the human system are to produce 
fat without strength, to produce heat, and to enrich the fatty corpuscles of the 
blood. An excess of fats is apt to cause sores from the effects on the blood. 
More fat may be used in cold weather than in warm, and more may be eaten 
by persons whose daily life is active and outdoors, without injurious effect. 

COOKING. — The fat used in cooking is largely a matter of taste, 
although some fats will cook better than others in certain dishes. For frying, 
lard, cottolene, olive oil, pork fat, ham fat and bacon are all claimed as favorites 
by certain persons, and, if not used to excess, are not injurious. 

FILLINGS. 

For cakes see under "Cakes" in this department. 

FISH. 

BAKED. — Clean and wipe three pounds of fish, cut four gashes on each 
side, stuff, sew, rub over with salt and flour, tie fish in shape, place upright on 
narrow strips of cloth in a dripping pan, put strips of fat salt pork in gashes, 
and bake in hot oven from thirty-five to forty-five minutes, basting frequently 
with a little butter melted in hot water. If oily fish, like mackerel or bluefish, 
no pork will be needed. Serve fish with drawn butter or Holland sauce. To 
remove the fish from the pan lift it by the strips of cloth and place on a hot 
platter. Take out strips of cloth, pork and strings. To carve the fish cut 
along the backbone, then cut down at right angles with it, drawing the fish 
away from the bone. Raise bone to reach the stuffing. The skeleton should 
be left whole on the platter. 

BOILED FISH. — Clean the fish, tie up in a piece of cloth, put in boiling 
salted water, to which has been added a little vinegar or lemon juice, and cook 
slowly till flesh leaves the bone, which will require ten to fifteen minutes per 
pound. Thick pieces take a longer time to cook than thin ones. Drain, take 
off the skin, place fish on a hot platter and serve with drawn butter or Holland 
sauce. 



110 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

BROILED. — Clean and wipe the fish as clean as possible, sprinkle with 
salt and pepper, place in a well greased broiler and broil for about fifteen 
minutes. The slices of fish should be turned over often, but a whole fish 
should have the flesh side broiled first and then turned for the skin side to 
broil just long enough to become brown and crisp. 

FRIED. — Oily fish like salmon, mackerel or bluefish should never be 
fried. Cod should be cleaned, skinned, boned and cut in small pieces one inch 
thick. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, dip in cornmeal and fry in a frying pan 
in hot salt pork fat till the fish is browned nicely on both sides. In turning 
the fish be careful not to break it. 

STUFFED. — Take one cup of breadcrumbs, one tablespoonful each of 
melted butter and chopped parsley, a half tablespoonful of salt, quarter as 
much pepper and one-third cup skimmed milk. Mix well together into thick 
mass. Clean and trim fish carefully, fill with the above, rub with butter and 
bake for fifteen minutes in hot oven. 

FOODS. 

CHILDREN.— See Department of Children. 

INFANTS.— See Department of Children (Infants' Section). 

INVALIDS. — Foods for the sick should be cooked and served in very 
clean pans and dishes, which should be sterilized occasionally. It should be 
served in small quantities, and made as attractive as possible. Never allow 
dirty dishes or remnants of food to remain in the room, and never allow rem- 
nants to be used by others. What foods they shall or shall not eat must be 
determined by the doctor or nurse, and is too exhaustive a subject to be treated 
here. 

NATURAL. — Possibly one of the greatest evils of our eating in these 
days is the small amount of natural foods used compared with cooked and 
highly flavored and seasoned foods. The average person would be in better 
health if they ate a larger proportion of raw fruits, such vegetables as are 
edible when raw, the peelings or skins of fruit and vegetables, nuts, dates, 
figs, grain, etc., etc. Man's anatomy shows that nature intended that the 
greater part of his food should be vegetables, but at the same time prepared 
him to use a certain percentage of meat. Where possible to secure it fresh and 
pure, milk should be one of the large factors of our diet. 

PREPARATION. — Soups and broths: Where economy of nutriment is 
an important object to be attained, it is probable that the production of broths 
and soups, from vegetables and meat in combination, affords many and great 
advantages. In making nutritious broths, a fair allowance of meat, if intended 
to be eaten with the soup, should be cut into small pieces. In any case, the 
meat should be put in cold water, but should not be boiled, except when the 
vegetables are cooked in the same utensil, a temperature of about 150 degrees 
Fahrenheit being quite sufficient. 

If the meat is plunged into hot or boiling water at the outset, the 
external layer of albumen is coagulated, and the juices are prevented from 
escaping. 

BOILED MEAT. — In boiling meat, on the other hand, when the object 
is to retain as much as possible of the soluble juices in the meat, the piece 
ought to be of good size, and it should at once be put into boiling water, to 



DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 111 

coagulate the outside albumen. After being kept boiling for about five minutes 
the saucepan should be placed aside, and the temperature allowed to lower 
gradually; or it may be lowered by the addition of three pints cold water to 
each gallon of boiling water. 

BOILED FISH.— In boiling fish, the addition of salt makes the flesh 
firmer and more retentive of the flavor. 

GREEN VEGETABLES.— In cooking green vegetables, they should be 
carefully washed in cold water, but not allowed to remain in it, then put into 
boiling water and cooked quickly. Potatoes should be boiled in their skins, 
and after boiling for about five minutes most of the water should be poured 
off, and then the potatoes should be steamed. 

ROASTED MEAT.— In roasting meat, the joint should be placed at 
first before a brisk, hot fire, with a view, as in boiling, to coagulate the outside 
albumen, and then the roasting may be done more slowly. 

STEWED MEAT. — Stewing has this advantage over dry-baking: that 
there is no risk of charring, and the meat is rendered juicy and tender. Tough 
and strong-flavored meats are, perhaps, best cooked in this way, because they 
can be rendered very palatable and digestible by the addition of vegetables 
and seasoning. 

FRIED MEAT. — Frying is even worse than baking, unless very care- 
fully done; broiling on the gridiron is an excellent way of cooking chops, 
steaks, kidneys and small dishes of fish or fowl. 

PRESERVED. — There are many good ways of preserving vegetable 
foods, but all animal foods, such as milk, meat, fish, shellfish, etc., should not 
be eaten unless fresh enough to be fit without any artificial aid. Putrid meat 
and sour milk may be doctored in a way to make it usable, but all such should 
be carefully avoided. 

Why is Food Required? 

USE. — The question seems almost absurd, so familiar is the fact; and 
yet the answer to it involves one of the grandest chapters in the history of 
science. In its simplest form it may be given in three words: It is Fuel. We 
require food frequently, for just the very reason that a fire needs coal fre- 
quently, and a lamp needs oil. Our lungs contain oxygen, and this oxygen 
combines with, or burns, the muscles or other organs of our bodies just as it 
does the coal in a fire. About 30 ounces of oxygen a day are thus consumed, 
requiring about 12 ounces of carbon to replace the waste, or, say 3 pounds of 
bread. The heat produced in a man's body in the course of a day is consider- 
able in quantity, though not very intense in quality. Taking the average, it is 
enough to raise five and a half gallons of water from freezing point to boiling 
point, and this is about the heat that would be given off during the burning of 
a pound of coal. All this heat comes from slow wasting or burning of the 
substance of the body, so that it is evident that, if we did not make up for this 
constant loss by eating food, our organs would soon be wasted away and 
consumed. 

VALUE. — Young meat is less valuable than older, because it taxes the 
digestion more. Beef is at its best for food when the animal is about six years 
old, and mutton three. Meat has its greatest food value in the female animal, 
and in the autumn, after the summer's good feeding. Mutton is more easily 



112 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

digested than beef. Pork is rich and hard to digest, and should not be eaten 
in summer. Venison is digestible, but too rich for some persons. Bacon is 
the only cured meat made more digestible by the process. Bones contain great 
nourishment. Cook the bones with the meat. If hollow, break or saw, so the 
marrow will cook into the meat. The white meat of fish is very digestible, 
more so than the red. Cod is the hardest of the white fish to digest, but con- 
tains much nutriment. Raw oysters digest themselves, furnish good nourish- 
ment, soothe the digestive organs and make blood fast. Eggs are more bene- 
ficial when eaten raw, and next best when boiled slightly or for a long time. 
Soups are very valuable focds, the combinations of meat and vegetable being 
most complete. The starchy foods are the most valuable of the vegetables. 
Light bread is rich in food value and easy to digest. Heavy bread, crackers, 
dough and macaroni are harder. Oatmeal is rich, but does not agree with 
some persons. Barley is excellent. Rye is strengthening and digestible. 
Rice is very rich in starch, and is a safe and valuable food. Buckwheat is rich 
in carbon and should be used with wheat or rye. 

Beans and peas are nutritious, but should be well cooked and chewed. 
Nuts are very rich foods, but somewhat hard to digest. Plums are too acid 
for most stomachs. Potatoes are rich in starch, and easy to digest, if light 
and mealy. New potatoes are harder to digest than older ones. Cabbage, 
cauliflower, etc., are attractive and wholesome foods, but contain a great 
amount of sulphur and are hard to digest. Pears are easier to digest, but less 
nutritious than apples. Bananas are rich in nitrogen, and are good food. 
Vinegar, seasoning and combinations with such articles are hard to digest. 
They stimulate the digestive organs. Coffee and tea are excellent stimulants, 
nerve tonics and exhilirators, but should be used in moderation, and not at all 
by growing children. 

FRUITS. 

CANNED. — Pare, core and trim the fruit and add enough sugar for 
present eating, not over four pounds to the bushel. Let stand until sugar 
dissolves. Heat to boil, and boil a quarter to half hour. Heat the cans or 
jars in warm water, fill with the fruit while hot and seal airtight. 

COOKED. — Fruits should only be cooked in order to preserve them so 
that we may have the use of them at other times than the natural season of 
perfection. See "Raw." 

PRESERVED. — Prepare the fruit, and add one pound of sugar for each 
pound of prepared fruit. Cook together until the fruit is done soft, but still 
retains its shape, and put up hot in heated cans or jars, which must be sealed 
to keep the air out. 

RAW. — Nature prepared fruits as a natural food for man, and they are 
safe, wholesome foods unless there is something wrong with us. If a person 
is in a condition of excessive acids, fruit containing acids should be avoided 
at such time. 

For a person in normal health, nature sets before him certain fruits in 
certain seasons, and each has a beneficial action on his health. Fruits should, 
of course, be well cleaned, and any foreign substance removed, but they are 
better unpeeled. Indigestible seeds, pits, stones, etc., should be removed. 

VALUE.— See "Value" under "Foods." 



DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 113 

GAME. 

HINTS. — The average city residents have little or no occasion to cook 
game, so we will not go into the subject in great detail, but will say that the 
treatment of game fowls is much the same as common poultry, and game 
meats much like common meats. Care must be taken in some cases to remove 
a surplus of "wild" taste. In selecting game fowl in market, the same indica- 
tions show young birds as in domestic fowl. 

BIRDS. — Small birds should be washed and dried, and then broiled 
or roasted until done, and served with cranberries or currant jelly. 

QUAIL ON TOAST.— Clean well, but do not remove the head or feet. 
Cross the feet over the breast and twist the neck around wing to side of breast. 
Baste with butter, and sprinkle with flour when nearly done, and baste until 
browned. Place toast on serving plate and pour drippings over it, and serve 
birds on it. Use beef gravy as sauce. Other game birds may be served the 
same way. 

ROAST WILD DUCK.— Clean thoroughly and stuff with poultry 
filling. Roast for a half hour and make gravy in pan. Serve with cranberries 
or currant jelly. If the duck is of a variety that feeds partially or entirely on 
fish, soak over night in strong, salty water. 

GREENS. — See "Greens" under "Dandelion" in this department. All 
other greens are treated in about the same manner. If the leaves are soft 
and wilted, place in very cold water for a half hour before cooking, after 
washing in many waters to remove all dirt and grit. 

GRIDDLE CAKES 

Take one and a half pints of milk and add the well-beaten yolks of six 
eggs and a little salt. Mix in slowly a half pound sifted flour and a table- 
spoonful of butter melted. Then add the whites of the eggs, beaten to a froth, 
making a batter as thick as rich cream. Have the griddle good and hot, grease 
with the fatty side of a piece of ham skin and dip batter on a spoonful at a 
time. When brown below and full of bubbles on top, turn over and brown 
other side. Serve with jelly, molasses, butter or maple syrup. 

GRUELS. 

BEEF. — Stew the juices out of beef as for beef tea, and stir in flour until 
thick and smooth. Add equal parts rice, water and milk until as thick as rich 
cream. Salt to taste. 

CORNMEAL. — A good gruel can be made by mixing a dessertspoonful 
of corn flour, which has first been blended with cold water, into a half pint of 
hot water; stir this on fire for ten minutes, sweeten with moist sugar, flavor 
with nutmeg or tablespoonful of wine. 

OATMEAL. — Pour a pint of boiling water into a saucepan; into this 
stir a couple of tablespoonfuls of oatmeal until quite smooth; this should boil 
well for ten or fifteen minutes; season with salt, then strain through a strainer, 
and add sugar. This is a soothing and nutritive food, holding a totally differ- 
ent position, on account of the nitrogenous matter present from the farinaceous 
preparations. Milk may be used instead of water. 



114 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

RICE GRUEL. — Take two ounces of rice, a quarter of an ounce of 
cinnamon, and two quarts of water; boil for forty minutes; then add a table- 
spoonful of orange marmalade. 

HAM. 

BAKED. — Soak young ham in cold water for an hour. Wipe off and 
place in earthen baking pan. Cover over with crust, and bake for an hour in 
slow oven. It will be juicy and have an excellent flavor. 

BROILED. — Freshen thin slices of ham by placing in cold water for 
a half hour. Drain dry and broil for five minutes over clear fire. Cut to 
serving size and place a poached egg on each piece. 

FRIED. — Freshen by soaking in cold water. Wipe off, trim off skin, 
score the fat edge, and fry in hot pan until fat is crisp. Thin slices fry very 
quickly. Overcooking causes toughness. 

HASH. 

DRY. — Take twice as much cold mashed or minced potato as minced 
cooked meat; add salt and pepper, to taste, and two tablespoonfuls butter or 
drippings for each cupful meat. Add one quarter as much warm water as 
meat and mix thoroughly. Grease frying pan and lay in even layer. Place 
over fire until bottom is browned; fold and turn out on hot platter. Carve 
down in slices. 

MINCED. — Prepare ingredients as for dry hash. Add two chopped, 
hard-boiled eggs for each cup of meat, and use one cup of milk or oatmeal 
water and one cup of gravy instead of a quarter cup of water. Place over fire 
and stir until it boils. Pour over slices of toast on hot platter, and sprinkle 
with chopped parsley and celery leaves. 

STEWED. — Cut left-overs of meats into quarter to half-inch pieces. 
Add twice as much same size pieces of raw potato, and an equal amount like 
pieces of stale bread. Chop an onion and add one teaspoonful for each cup 
of meat. Add one cup of water, one cup of gravy and a teaspoonful of butter 
for each cup of milk. Place over fire and stew for twenty minutes. 



HERRING. 

FRESH. — These fish, when taken in the spring, are a very rich and 
excellent food, enriching the blood very rapidly, and stimulating the nervous 
system and its organs. They should be used soon after being caught, and 
should be cleaned and placed on ice as soon as procured. They spoil in a 
few hours, and are then very injurious. They boil very quickly in seasoned 
water and vinegar, and make a very tempting dish when covered with egg 
sauce. 

HORSE RADISH. 

Newly-grated horse raddish is an appetizing condiment to those who like 
it, and is useful as a stimulant to the digestive organs and the kidneys. Taken 
freely it will loosen a cold in the head and decrease hoarseness.

116 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

HOT FOODS. 

Hot foods stimulate the digestive secretions of the stomach, and their 
heat is taken up by the blood, causing a feeling of warmth in the body. If 
not too hot, and used in moderation they are good, but we should not forget 
that foods that heat the body by digestion are best for us. Too hot or too 
continual warm foods deprive the organs of the chance to work naturally, and 
eventually injure them. More warm food may be taken without harm in cold 
weather than in hot, as the system then appropriates the heat quickly. 

ICE CREAM. 

CHEAP. — Dissolve a half-pound cornstarch in one quart milk. Add 
five quarts milk, sweeten and flavor highly, and freeze. 

COFFEE. — Take a tablespoonful of pulverized coffee for each quart 
liquid to be frozen. Put on stove in covered pot and steep without boiling, 
in a cup of water to each spoonful, for a full hour. Strain and cool, and use 
for flavoring. 

OTHER FLAVORS.— The ice cream is made the same for all flavors, 
which may be any of the berries, either juice or crushed, fruit or nut. In 
using nuts as a flavor, they should be ground fine. 

RICH. — Take one quart of sweet cream, one quart of rich milk, one 
pound of sugar, and flavor to taste. This cream is so rich that less flavoring 
is needed than in poorer cream. Dissolve the sugar before freezing. 

ICES. 

LEMON. — Make a pint of thick syrup by melting sugar in water, add 
half a pint each lemon juice and water and a little grated lemon peel. Let 
stand for half an hour, strain and freeze. Mix a little sugar in the beaten 
whites of two eggs and mix in when ice begins to set. 

ORANGE. — Make same as lemon ice, but use less sugar, according to 
sweetness of oranges. 

RASPBERRY. — Clean and crush one pint of berries and strain through 
cheesecloth bag. Add one pint strong sugar syrup, juice of one lemon, one 
pound of sugar and a half a pint of water. Mix well and freeze. 

ICINGS. 

CHOCOLATE. — Take three tablespoonfuls of hot water, mix in three 
teaspoonfuls of cocoa until smooth. Gradually stir in pulverized sugar until 
thick enough to spread. Spread while cake is warm. 

PLAIN. — Make same as chocolate, using two tablespoonfuls of water 
and a few drops of vanilla before stirring in sugar. 

SUGAR. — This icing is used on very rich cakes and on wedding cake. 
Mix one ounce of fine starch with one pound of pulverized sugar, and sift 
carefully. Beat the whites of two eggs very light, and stir in the sugar and 
starch a little at a time. When all beaten in, flavor with almond and beat 
again. Spread while cake is hot, and it will harden quickly.

118 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

IRISH MOSS. 

Macerate an ounce of the moss in cold water for fifteen minutes. Drain 
and boil in two quarts of water for fifteen minutes. Just before removing, add 
grated peel and juice of orange or lemon to taste. Strain and drink as a 
tea. To make a jelly, use three times as much moss. This hardens, when 
cold, into a very rich jelly food. 

JELLIES. 

CHICKEN. — Carefully clean and pound a young chicken, bones and all. 
Cover with cold water and let simmer slowly until meat falls apart and half 
the water is cooked away. Strain and wash through colander and then strain 
through cloth. Season to taste and cook slowly again for ten minutes. Skim 
when cold and place on ice. Serve sliced cold, or in sandwiches. 

CURRANT AND OTHER BERRIES.— Place the berries in preserving 
kettle and stir gently while cooking until soft and juicy. Strain through fine 
sieve, without pressure, and the juice through a jelly bag. Weigh and boil 
hard for fifteen minutes. For each pound of juice, stir in a half-pound of 
sugar while off the fire until dissolved. Boil fast again for ten minutes and 
pour into hot glasses. Skim from time to time during cooking, to make clear. 

EXTRACT. — Boil a quarter ounce powdered alum in a pint of water 
for a couple of minutes, add four pounds of pulverized sugar, boil for five 
minutes and add a one-ounce bottle extract of lemon, vanilla, strawberry, etc. 
This makes an excellent and very good substitute when fruit cannot be had. 

FRUIT. — Squeeze out the juice of the fruit raw, or cook slightly and 
squeeze through jelly bag. For each pound of juice, add a pound of sugar, 
and boil until stiffens when a little is taken out on a cold plate. 

LEMON. — Soak half a box of gelatine in a cup of cold water. Wash 
and pare the yellow of the peel of one lemon very thin. Put the peel in a 
quart of hot water in a saucepan. Boil for two minutes and pour hot over 
the gelatine. Add one and a half cups sugar and the juice of five lemons. 
Strain and pour into cold, wet dish. 

LINSEED. — Take a half pound linseed to three pints cold water. Let 
simmer for two hours, and strain through jelly bag. Sweeten and flavor to 
taste with lemon juice. This food is very soothing to the intestines and is 
much recommended for invalids. 

JUNKET. 

Heat one quart of milk lukewarm, add half a cup of sugar and half a 
teaspoonful of vanilla. Dissolve one junket tablet in a tablespoonful of warm 
water, mix in one tablespoonful of liquid rennet and add to milk. Mix well, 
pour into cups and set to cool. Before serving, grate nutmegs over the tops. 
This is an easily assimilated food. 

LUNCHEONS. 

Luncheons should be the housewife's laboratory. As a rule there are 
few at home then, and those that eat less than the rest of the family. We 
could give endless sample menus, but we think this should be the chance for 



DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 119 

experimenting. Hundreds of dainty luncheon dishes can be made of the 
surplus of the food from other meals. These may be made into different 
combinations and the wife, by experimenting, develop a lot of dishes that 
are all her own. 

MACARONI. 

Macaroni, noodles, spaghetti, etc., are made by moulding a stiff paste 
of wheat flour and water into tubes or sticks, and drying thoroughly. It is 
an excellent, inexpensive and nutritious food, especially when baked with 
cheese. It should be broken up and soaked in cold water for several hours, 
then boiled in salted water and meat broth until thoroughly swollen. Then 
place in well-greased pan with grated cheese and bake in quick oven until top 
is a golden brown. 

MACKEREL. 

BAKED FRESH.— Clean, trim and split the fish, sprinkle with salt 
and pepper and dot over with butter. Place in greased pan, pour over one 
cup milk and bake for half hour. Place on hot platter and use milk from 
pan for sauce. 

SALT. — Wash the fish through several waters to remove all loose salt, 
and soak in a lot of water over night. Wash through two or three waters \Ln 
the morning and parboil in frying pan for ten minutes. Drain, sprinkle with 
pepper and spread with butter. 

MEALS. 

KEEPING. — The keeping of meals is a matter for which no set rules 
can be made, but one which every housewife must study out and arrange to 
suit the conditions in her individual case. In the cities there are probably 
very few households where the entire family can sit down and eat all together 
at a set time. It then becomes very necessary to devise ways and means 
for keeping the meals in attractive and palatable condition. Experience only 
can teach how to do this, but it is well worth considerable trouble, both in 
credit for the housewife and pleasure for others, and also in economy. 

PREPARATION. — The preparation and serving of meals is one of the 
main branches of that home-making which places woman on her throne as 
queen of the home. The young woman who forms partnership in matrimony 
without learning the art of making a home attractive stands in great danger 
of seeing the lover disappear in the husband, while she who studies the noble 
and honorable art of home-making and family catering has much more assur- 
ance of a permanent lover and happiness. Do not let the fatal and foolish idea 
take hold of you that cooking or serving meals is menial or degrading. It is 
woman's greatest and most honorable place, and deep in the affections and 
minds of sensible men the good housewife is honored and loved with a love 
that will remain through life. Learn the taste of those whom it is your 
pleasure to prepare for, and in a thousand ways you can make home too 
attractive to stay away from, and the meals too good to miss. This can be 
done by the poorest persons, for more can be accomplished by study and a 
little work than by the lavish use of money. The same dish may be prepared 
a dozen times, but each may be a new and pleasant surprise by changing the 
cooking, serving or garnishing. The table may be laid differently and adorned 
with different styles continually.

MEATS. 

BEEF A LA MODE. — Line a round of beef with slices of fat bacon 
dipped in vinegar; roll it up with chopped seasoning of cloves, sage, parsley, 
thyme, pepper and green onions; bind close and put it in a kettle; then cook 
slowly for ten or twelve hours, turn when half done, thicken with a heaping 
tablespoonful of flour added when the fluid is reduced one-half. 

BEEF CROQUETTES.— See "Beef" in this department. 

BEEF STEW.— See "Beef" in this Department. 

BOILED LEG MUTTON.— Cut off the shank and trim the knuckle; boil 
three hours; when this is partly cooked add a little salt. Serve with sauce, and 
preferably cut cold; save the water for stock, boiling up the shank, well cracked, 
and the knuckle. Mashed turnips are usually served with it. 



H'nd Quarter 




BROILED COLD MEATS.— Cut the cold meat into slices and place 
them on the gridiron, properly cleansed, and rubbed over with a little butter; 
put into a hot dish a piece of butter the size of a walnut, and a teaspoonful 
of catsup; melt together, and lay the meat from the gridiron on the gravy 
made by these ingredients as soon as it is done. 

CORNED BEEF AND CABBAGE.— Wash, and if very salt, soak in 
cold water for an hour, a piece of corned beef weighing five or six pounds. 
Put in a kettle with cold water to cover, place on stove, heat slowly, skimming 
off scum as it rises to the top of the water. Cook meat slowly for three or 
four hours, or till very tender. Take out the meat, and in the liquor cook the 
cabbage and some potatoes that have been washed and pared. If beets are 
to be used, cook them in boiling water in a kettle by themselves. When cab- 
bage and potatoes are tender take out with a skimmer and serve with the 
meat. Save the liquor, cover, and use the fat that rises to the top in warming 
up hash. Any fat not used in cooking should be saved for soapmaking.

DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 



DRIED BEEF. — Slice the dried beef fine and stew it in a little water 
until tender; beat up an egg with a little flour; add a lump of butter to the 
beef, stir in the egg and flour, and serve on toasted bread. Milk may be used 
instead of water. 

IRISH STEW. — Either beef or mutton may be used; cut it into pieces 
about an inch square and cover with cold water. Allow to two pints of meat, 
two onions, eight good-sized potatoes, two teaspoonfuls of salt and a half 
teaspoonful of pepper. Cover and cook for two hours, skimming as it boils up; 
thicken the gravy with flour, stirred smooth. Serve hot. 

KIDNEYS. — Skin and parboil some sheep's kidneys, cut them in slices, 
and fry them in butter for a few minutes, with pepper and salt to taste; mix a 
tablespoonful of flour with a piece of butter in a saucepan, stir until it begins 
to color, then add a teacupful of good gravy and the same quantity of sherry; 
let this boil for five minutes, then add to the kidneys, with a small quantity of 
parsley finely minced; make them very hot, but do not boil, and serve. 




MEAT PIE. — Clean two pounds of raw meat; cut in inch pieces and 
place in layers in pudding pan. Mix four tablespoonfuls of flour, one of salt, 
and one-eighth of pepper, and sprinkle each layer. Add two cups of boiling 
water, cover and cook in a slow oven about three hours, until meat is cooked, 
but not falling apart. Add water if necessary. Cover closely with a quarter- 
inch crust-dough made of two cups of flour, one tablespoonful of salt, three 
of butter or lard, three and a half of baking powder, and milk enough to 
moisten. Cut hole in centre to let steam out, and bake in hot oven for twenty 
minutes. Odds and ends of cooked meat, dampened with gravy, may be used 
instead of raw meat, but need not cook so long before baking. Inch pieces 
of potatoes may be used, if desired. 

ROAST BEEF.— See "Beef" in this department. 

ROAST MUTTON. — A nice shoulder or chime is generally used for 
roasting. It is best to wash mutton in cold or lukewarm water and dry it with 
a clean cloth. Place in a dripping-pan in a hot oven, with a little water; after 
searing the surface, top and bottom, cook moderately in a steady heat; it re- 
quires a little basting; roast fifteen minutes for each pound of the meat. A 



DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS

shoulder is nice when boned and filled with bread filling, seasoned with thyme, 
salt and pepper. This gives a delicious flavor to the meat. If gravy is needed 
make it in the same way as beef gravy. 

ROAST PORK. — Bone a shoulder, as in mutton; fill if preferred, substi- 
tuting sage or sweet marjoram for the thyme. Onion may also be used if the 
flavor is liked. Make gravy as for beef. The spare ribs, leg and loin are all

delicious when roasted and cut cold. A young pig three or four weeks old 
can can be roasted whole. It should be roasted slowly, and requires long 
cooking. 

ROAST VEAL. — Take out the bone of a fillet of veal, and prepare a 
filling of bread, thyme, pepper and salt, and fill with it the cavity (onion can 
be used also in the dressing), then roast in moderately hot oven, as veal takes 
long and slow cooking. When cooked to nice brown remove. It should be 




basted while cooking. If gravy is desired make it in the same way as beef 
gravy. Veal is so dry that a moist dressing is best. The shoulder, loin, 
knuckle and breast may be roasted the same way. 

ROLLED FLANK. — Remove skin and extra fat from three pounds of 
flank. Make a stuffing with one cup of crumbs, two tablespoonfuls chopped 
salt pork, or a little melted butter, one-half teaspoonful of salt, one teaspoonful 



124 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

of sage and a little pepper, mixed with enough milk or water to moisten. 
Spread it over the meat, roll up, tieing or sewing it to keep in the stuffing, and 
cook like a pot roast, using more water. 

STEAK.— See "Beef" in this department. 

STEWED LIVER. — Cut one pound of liver in one-inch blocks, pour 
boiling water over it, let stand three or four minutes, drain, put in saucepan 
with slice of onion, one teaspoonful of salt, one-eighth teaspoonful 
of pepper, one tablespoonful of catsup and one quart boiling water. 
Cover tightly and cook slowly till liver is tender. Then melt two tablespoon- 
fuls of butter in another saucepan and cook in it two and one-half tablespoon- 
fuls of flour; till flour and butter are brown, add gradually the gravy from the 
liver, stirring until thick and smooth. Place the liver in a hot dish and pour 
the browned gravy over it. 

SWEETBREADS.— Parboil the sweetbreads, cut them in slices and 
dip them in eggs well-beaten, then into cracker dust or bread crumbs; fry 
until brown; season with pepper, salt, chopped parsley, and the grated yellow 
rind of one lemon. They are served with melted butter or mushroom catsup. 
They may be garnished with bacon, fried in thin slices. 

TRIPE. — Boil the tripe tender, wipe it dry and dip it in a batter made 
of eggs, flour and milk; fry until brown; season with salt, garnish with parsley. 
It may be boiled and cut into small pieces and covered with a jelly made by 
boiling a few cloves in vinegar. 

VEAL CUTLETS.— Take the cutlets— those from the leg are best— and 
cut them in pieces as near one size as possible; dip them in well-beaten egg, 
and then into cracker dust and fry slowly to a golden brown. If the veal is 
tough, parboil it for ten or fifteen minutes; dry before frying. 

VEAL PATTIES. — Chop up the veal and some ham, using one-third 
ham to two-thirds veal; add powdered crackers wet with gravy or hot milk, 
two tablespoonfuls of butter, and one beaten egg; season well and bake in 
patty pans; if eaten hot (and most people like them better hot) line the pans 
with puff paste and send them to the table. 

VEAL POT PIE. — Cut two pounds neck or lower part of leg in 
small pieces and brown in frying pan with pork fat or drippings. Season and 
cook like beef stew. Then cover with crust as for meat pie and bake until 
crust is done, in hot oven. 

MILK. 

KEEPING. — Milk should be kept cold all the time in order to keep it 
perfectly sweet, but even if this is done there will be times when it will begin 
to turn before used. Milk sours very quickly during thunder storms. We 
do not advise the use of any preservative, but milk which has just begun to 
turn may be used by stirring in carefully a little saleratus and sugar. It will 
not restore the exact natural taste, but will make the milk fit to use. 

MODIFIED. — Mix milk, cream, water, limewater and sugar in such 
proportions as the age and strength of the person require, or the needs of the 
case demand. Modified milk is used mostly for infants and invalids. 

PORRIDGE. — Mix two tablespoonfuls of flour with a teaspoonful of 
salt and a little cold milk. Stir this into one quart of boiling milk and add 
an ounce of raisins. Boil half an hour, strain and serve with grated nutmeg.

126 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

PURITY. — Milk has been proven one of the greatest carriers of 
disease germs, and many diseases of the cow are transferrable to persons. It 
is therefore necessary to be very careful in selecting the source of supply. It 
is advisable to strain milk through a fine cloth, not that this will remove the 
germs, but it will remove some, and also foreign matter to which the germs 
may adhere. 

TOAST. — Boil a cup of sweet milk and season with salt and pepper. 
Pour over two slices of buttered toast in a soup dish. 

MUFFINS. 

Mix one quart of milk, one slightly beaten egg, one tablespoonful butter, 
two teaspoonfuls of lard, a half cup of yeast and enough flour to make a fairly 
stiff batter. Set to rise over night, and bake in morning in greased muffin 
rings. 

MUTTON. 

See "Meats" in this Department. 

OMELETS. 
EGG. — See "Eggs" in this Department. 

HAM. — Beat four eggs very light, chop boiled or fried ham enough to 
flavor, season to taste, add a little chopped parsley, fry in buttered pan until 
brown and fold over. 

OYSTER. — Make same as ham, using parboiled oysters and celery in 
place of ham and parsley. 

ONIONS. 

BOILED. — Peel and soak in cold water for ten minutes. Boil for ten 
minutes in salted water and drain. Boil again until tender. Drain and rinse 
in boiling water. Serve hot, with salt, pepper and butter, or white sauce. 

FRIED. — Peel, rinse and parboil onions for five minutes. Slice thinly, 
crosswise, and fry in ham or bacon fat until brown. Add ham gravy, if de- 
sired. 

GRUEL. — Slice and boil in gruel water until tender. Add oatmeal, 
mixed smooth in cold water and a little butter. Boil for five minutes and 
strain. 

MEDICAL VALUE. — No other vegetable furnishes the number of 
ready remedies for home use that this common one does, and its liberal use 
is highly recommended. Boiled and eaten freely, it will cure constipation. 
The gruel is a mild laxative. Sliced and sprinkled with sugar, a syrup is made 
which is a relief for croup, given a teaspoonful every fifteen minutes. Burns 
and scalds are quickly relieved with onion juice squeezed into sugar. 

ORANGEADE. 

Take a cup of boiling water and stir in the juice of one orange, the 
grated peel of a half orange, and sugar enough to make a syrup. Cool and 
add water until it suits the taste. 



DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 127 



OYSTERS. 

BAKED. — Scrub the shells very clean with stiff brush. Rinse well and 
place in clean baking pan and bake until shells open. Take out of shells and 
place on toast. Take juice from pan, add salt, pepper and butter and dip over 
oysters and toast. 

BROTH. — Take a pint of oysters and add half as much milk and the 
same of water. Cook very slowly in saucepan for fifteen minutes. Season 
to taste and strain before serving. 

FRIED. — Drain the juice off the oysters. Beat up fresh eggs and add 
some of the juice. Dip the oysters in cracker dust and then in the egg alter- 
nately several times. Have a frying pan half full of what fat you choose, olive 
oil, lard, butter or cottolene, and fry them swimming until a yellow brown. 
Garnish with scullions or parsley. 

ROAST. — Drain the oysters and place in dry saucepan. Shake pan 
slightly while cooking until edges shrivel. Season with salt, pepper and butter 
and place on buttered toast. Sprinkle with chopped parsley. 

SCALLOPED. — Drain one pint oysters and strain half a cup of the 
juice. Melt two tablespoonfuls of butter and mix with cup and a half of 
bread crumbs, and the strained juice. Put a layer of this in a greased baking 
dish and cover with a layer of oysters. Season well with salt and pepper. Fill 
the dish with alternate layers, having crumbs on top. Pour in the rest of 
the juice, and bake in hot oven for half hour, or until top crumbs are crisp 
and brown. 

STEWED. — Drain off the liquor, strain and simmer until right hot. 
Then add rich milk or cream and when hot again pour in oysters. Remove 
immediately and pour into hot dish. Add salt, pepper and lumps of butter. 
Serve at once. 

PARSLEY. 

This is one of the best garnishes and flavoring herbs we have. It is 
inexpensive, its taste is very much appreciated by those who have learned to 
use it, and it is easy to procure at almost any time of the year. Its appearance 
on or about foods makes them very attractive. 

PARSNIPS. 

These vegetables have a soothing effect on the stomach. They should 
be washed, scraped and boiled until tender. Serve small ones whole, or large 
ones quartered, seasoned with salt and pepper and with melted butter or olive 
oil over them. To fry, slice the boiled parsnips about a half-inch thick and 
brown both sides in butter. 

PIES. 

This form of a dessert is one of the most indigestible, and should not 
be used to any great extent, and what are used should not be rich. 

CRUST. — A very tasty and yet not rich crust may be made as follows, 
this being enough for the double crust of one pie. Sift together one and a 
quarter cups of flour, one teaspoonful of salt, and one-eighth teaspoonful of 
baking powder. Rub in one-third cup of lard or cottoline and mix in enough 
water to make stiff dough. Knead well and roll out to fit plate. 



128 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

FILLINGS. — The crust of pies should be baked quickly, and this gives 
the filling little time to cook. Care should therefore be used to precook any 
kind of filling so that it will be thoroughly done by the time the crust is well 
baked. 

PORK. 

See "Foods" and "Meats" in this Department. 

PORRIDGE. 

MILK. — Mix a tablespoonful of flour with a little cold water and put 
into one cup of warm milk. Boil for seven or eight minutes, stirring con- 
tinuously. Season with salt, and strain if lumpy. Sweeten if desired. This 
may be given for diarrhoea, as its action in such cases is mild. 

POTATOES. 

BAKED. — Wash the potatoes carefully and bake in the skins. It will 
take an hour to bake large ones. They should be eaten with salt the moment 
they are done. They may be peeled and baked with meat of any kind, and are 
delicious in this way. They should be basted once or twice with the drippings. 
Sweet potatoes may be roasted the same way. 

CAKES. — Take some mashed potatoes and mix a little flour with them; 
then make them into little patties and fry them, with little grease, over a 
hot fire until they are brown. 

CHIPS. — Wash and peel the potatoes, and cut them into thin shavings; 
have ready boiling fat, and drop them into it; when done to a light brown 
drain them over or before the fire, and sprinkle fine salt over them; keep them 
crisp and serve hot. 

CREAMED. — Put two ounces of butter into a saucepan with a dessert- 
spoonful of flour, and some parsley and scullions, both chopped fine; salt and 
pepper to taste; mix together and add a little cream, and set on fire, stirring 
constantly until it boils; cut cold boiled potatoes into slices and put them into 
the saucepan with the mixture; boil again, and serve very hot. 

FRIED RAW. — Peel and slice the potatoes into very thin slices; put 
them in cold water for a little while; dry with towel, and put them into frying 
pan with a little butter or lard, salt and pepper; cover down, and every little 
while turn them; when they are tender and a nice rich brown they are done. 
The grease should be drained from them when sent to the table. 

LYONNAISE. — Slice six cold boiled potatoes, chop up very fine an 
onion and a little parsley, enough to fill a teaspoon; put a tablespoonful of but- 
ter into a frying pan, and fry the onion to a light brown; then add the potatoes, 
and fry them also to a light brown, turning them often; put them in a hot dish 
and stir in the parsley, and pour over them any butter that may be left in the 
pan. Potatoes prepared in this way are liked by almost everyone. 

MASHED. — Boil the potatoes, after peeling them and taking out the 
spots; let them lie a while in cold water; then put them on the stove in a sauce- 
pan with lukewarm water; when dry and mealy drain off the water and mash 
them fine with a potato masher; add a small bit of butter, a little milk, and salt 
to taste; then beat to a foam with a fork; heap lightly in a dish, and serve at 
once. 



DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 129 

POULTRY. 

CHICKEN. — Conditions are rapidly forming by which the price of 
meats are becoming high, and more chickens are being raised than ever before. 
These are bringing this kind of poultry more prominently into the market as 
a staple, at a price that makes its use more general. 

DUCK. — Both domestic and wild ducks are excellent foods, but will 
never be the popular food that chickens are, because there is less meat and 
more bone. They are more expensive, harder to cook, and have a high per- 
centage of fat. 

FRIED. — Dress and carve in the size pieces desired. Parboil for half 
an hour, or until tender but firm. Take from water on fork, allowing to 
drain, and place hot in frying pan with plenty of grease. Fry until brown, 
turning often. Make gravy of the frying juices and the parboiling water, thick- 
ened with flour and well seasoned. Wild ducks and guineas should be soaked 
in cold water before parboiling. In frying ducks or geese, less lard will be 
needed. 

GOOSE. — This fowl is even more greasy in composition than duck. In 
filling for roasting, a dryer filling should be used. The flesh is not properly 
flavored if the fatty parts are removed, but with the fat it is so rich that few 
people care for it often. Wild goose has less fat and a stronger flavor than 
tame. 

GUINEA. — This fowl is rapidly coming to the front as a substitute for 
game. The flesh is very dark and highly flavored, and it is much easier to 
find them in market than a few years ago, and the price is more reasonable. 
For those who do not care for a strong flavor, but like a gamy taste, this is 
very pleasing if soaked in cold water before cooking. 

ROAST. — Clean, wash and dry the fowl, and rub the inside with dry 
salt. Stuff with crumbled and broken bread, seasoned with salt, pepper and 
thyme. Sew up, cross the legs and tie the wings against body. Place in roast- 
ing pan with a little water and roast in moderate oven, basting frequently until 
tender and brown. Chop the liver, heart and gizzard, boil and thicken with 
flour. Place this in the pan after fowl has been removed, and cook into 
gravy. Cranberries, and onions boiled in milk go well with roast poultry. 

SELECTING. — Chicken is good any time in the year, but the other 
poultry is much better in cold weather. Young poultry can be told by smooth, 
soft feet, small, soft combs or wattles, plump breast, soft and flexible end of 
the breast bone, and pin feathers in soft, moist skin. Long hairs indicate old 
birds. Stale poultry may be detected by darkened flesh, dark combs or wattles, 
and sunken, dull eyes. 

STEWED. — Slice a half-pound of bacon and a piece of veal and place 
in large pot half full of water. Add three sprigs of parsley, two of thyme, 
seven or eight small onions, one carrot cut in pieces, two or three cloves, and 
then the cleaned and carved fowl. Cover closely and cook without boiling for 
two or three hours, or until the meat begins to fall apart. Just before serving, 
add inch-square pieces of toast. 

VALUE AS FOOD. — All poultry is a muscle-building and strength- 
producing food. It is a lighter and more digestible meat than beef, mutton or 



130 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

pork, the white meat of chicken being particularly easy to digest. Poultry 
should be very thoroughly cooked, not only because more digestible, but be- 
cause thorough cooking draws much good from the bones. 

PUDDINGS. 

BREAD. — Take one quart milk, add one cup of sugar, three well-beaten 
eggs, grated nutmeg and salt. Parboil a half-cup raisins and add. Then place 
in baking dish and float on top as many slices of buttered stale bread as possi- 
ble. Bake until bread is browned. 

CHARLOTTE RUSSE.— Take sponge layer cake and cut to fit bottom 
and sides of mould. Whip rich cream thoroughly and add beaten whites of 
eggs, about three to a pint of cream. Beat until stiff. Fill the cake cup and 
place on ice to set. 

CORNSTARCH. — Sweeten two quarts of milk with a cup of sugar. Boil 
in double boiler and add four tablespoonfuls cornstarch wet with milk. Stir 
often to avoid lumps, and after cooking a few minutes, add three well-beaten 
eggs and cook until it sets. Stir in vanilla flavoring, cover with meringue 
and brown in oven. 

CREAM CHOCOLATE.— Mix a half-cup sugar, three tablespoonfuls 
cornstarch, two of cocoa and half a teaspoonful of salt in half a cup of milk. 
Add two cups of scalded milk and cook over water for twenty minutes, stirring 
continuously. When done set in cold water to cool, flavor with a half-teaspoon- 
ful of vanilla, stirring often to keep skin from forming. Pour in deep dish, 
cover and keep cool until ready to serve. 

HASTY. — Stir one cup of yellow corn meal into three and a half cups 
boiling water with half a tablespoonful of salt in it. Stir all the time and cook 
for twenty minutes. Eat hot, with milk, molasses, jellies or fruit juices. 

PLAIN PLUM. — Mix in the order given, two cups flour, four teaspoon- 
fuls baking powder, one of salt, a half of cinnamon, a quarter of cloves, some 
grated nutmeg, two-thirds of a cup of sugar, two well-beaten eggs, one cup of 
rich milk, two tablespoonfuls melted butter and a half-cup of raisins, seeded, 
washed, cut in half and rolled in flour. Stir well together and place in greased 
pail that will hold half as much more. Cover and place in water half-way up. 
Cover the larger kettle and boil continuously for at least two hours. Serve hot, 
with hard or lemon sauce. 

RICE. — Put a cup of washed rice in a pudding pan with two quarts of 
rich milk. Add a half-cup of sugar, a pinch of salt and liberal grated nutmeg. 
Bake in moderate oven, stirring down the top skin and the rice up from the 
bottom several times. When rice is tender and milk boiled half away, add a 
little butter and brown again, and set to cool. Serve cold. 

SAGO. — Soak two tablespoonfuls sago in a little hot milk in covered 
dish until soft. Add grated nutmeg or lemon peel, sweeten to taste and beat 
in a well-beaten egg. Pour into cups and cook in boiling water a few minutes. 

SNOW. — Soak a quarter box of gelatine in a quarter cup of cold water, 
add one cup of boiling water, three-quarters cup sugar, a quarter cup of lemon 
juice and stir until gelatine is dissolved. Then add three well-beaten whites 
of eggs and beat all together with beater until stiff enough to hold shape. 
Pour into cold, wet bowl. Serve with soft custard made of egg yolks and 
cornstarch. 



DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 131 

TAPIOCA. — Wash the tapioca and soak in milk on back of stove for two 
hours. Beat the yolks of three eggs and mix with one cup of sugar, a little 
salt and a tablespoonful of butter, melted. Stir well into milk and cover with 
meringue of the whites of eggs and sugar beaten together. Bake in pudding 
dish in slow oven until top is brown. 

TAPIOCA BLANC MANGE.— Soak a half-pound of tapioca in a pint 
of milk until soft. Boil until tender and sweeten to taste. Shape in a mould 
while cooling, turn out on small, deep platter, pour cream around and dot over 
with jelly. 

PUMPKINS. 

This common and inexpensive vegetable is seldom liked in its natural 
state, but is very popular for pies when highly spiced and flavored. It is also 
used cut in inch pieces, highly flavored and served with carrots and parsnips 
in cream gravy. 

PUREE. 

Chop the meat and simmer in saucepan until cooked apart. Then rub 
through sieve or coarse cloth. If necessary, add a little warm water or milk 
to make it go through the sieve. Season with salt, pepper, and mashed parsley. 
Thin with rice water and serve as soup, or spread on buttered dry toast. 
Chicken and veal are most used for making puree, and in this condition are 
very easily digested. 

RADISH. 

This vegetable has a strong action on the kidneys, and its use in cases 
of Bright's disease is said to be beneficial. It is rather indigestible at best, 
and is especially so when old, dry and pithy. 

RAREBIT. 

Melt one teaspoonful of butter in saucepan, stir in three teaspoonfuls 
of flour mixed with a quarter teaspoonful each salt and mustard and a little red 
pepper, until smooth. . Cool and stir in a quarter cup of rich milk. Cook again 
until mixture boils; stirring constantly. Then place over hot water, add three- 
quarters cup of grated cheese and cook and stir until cheese melts. Add one 
beaten egg and cook without boiling until mixture thickens. Spread over 
toasted stale bread and serve hot. 

REFRESHMENTS. 

In the serving of refreshments to company, the housewife has the op- 
portunity of displaying her fine skill as a hostess, and we wish to impress upon 
young housekeepers that the cost of what is served has much less to do with 
her success than the manner of serving. Anticipating the tastes of the guests 
under the existing conditions is a fine art. One kind of entertainment will 
make a certain class of refreshment desirable that at another time would be 
inappropriate. If the evening has been spent in sitting still, something light 
and tasty will be most appreciated, while if there has been dancing or active 
games, more solid foods with cold dishes and plenty to drink will be more 
appreciated. If the company is too large to seat, or it is desired not to place 
them at table, such refreshments should be served as will cause them least 



132 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

inconvenience or dirt, and everything should be prepared for eating as nearly 
as can be. Slightly lowered lights and low music make an attractive accom- 
paniment to evening refreshments. If anything of a sticky nature has been 
served, finger bowls and napkins should be passed, or some provision made 
for their comfort in this way. 

RICE. 

See "Food Value" in this Department. 

ROASTS. 

See "Meats" in this Department. 

SALADS. 
CELERY. — Clean celery and cut across in one-eighth-inch sections and 
add a few of the yellow leaves chopped fine. Take an equal amount of cold 
boiled potato, quarter, and slice quarters crosswise same thickness as celery. 
Mix together with a little chopped parsley and scullions. Mix enough salad 
dressing in it to make it keep shape and mould on platter, sprinkling top with 
chopped parsley. 

CHICKEN SALAD. — Make the same as celery, using chopped roast 
chicken in place of potato, adding a tablespoonful of celery seed for each quart 
of salad, and dotting the mould with cranberry jam instead of sprinkling it 
with parsley. 

CRAB. — Make like chicken, substituting picked crab meat for chicken, 
and garnishing with sprays of parsley. 

DRESSINGS.— See "Dressings" in this Department. 

LOBSTER. — Boil the lobster for a half-hour; when it is cold take it from 
the shell, being careful to take out the vein in the back. To two large heads of 
salad allow six pounds of lobster, one cup of melted butter, two tablespoonfuls 
of mustard mixed with a little vinegar and salt and pepper to taste; chop 
them up together and spread on a flat dish, then thicken, stir it constantly, and 
when it has become cold spread it over with lobster dressing. The sauce may 
be served separately. 

POTATO. — Slice some fresh boiled or cold potatoes, dress them with 
oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, precisely like any other salad, adding a little onion 
and parsley chopped fine. Use cream or melted butter if oil is not liked 

WATER CRESS.— Wash the cress and drain it well. Chop a green 
onion, two radishes, one teaspoonful of grated horseradish and a few leaves of 
lettuce; season with a little salt and pepper, and plenty of oil and vinegar. 
This makes a crisp, delightful salad for table use. 

SAUCES. 
See "Dressings" in this Department. 

SEASONING. 

In the proper seasoning of foods lies a large part of the success of good 
cooking. Many housewives whose cooking is really done excellently lose the 
credit they would have if they seasoned their foods before or during the cook- 



DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 133 



ing instead of afterward. Of course, the individual tastes of those for whom 
the food is prepared must be taken into consideration, and as seasoning is an 
active stimulant of the digestive organs, it must be used with care. It is easy 
io acquire the taste for seasoning to such an extent that food cannot be en- 
joyed unless seasoned to the point that overstimulates and wears out the glands 
that secrete the digestive juices. 

SHELLFISH. 

See "Clams" and "Oysters" in this Department. 

SMOKED FOODS. 

Foods prepared in this way will keep indefinitely and are strong foods 
in that none of the strength or flavor has been cooked out. They are, how- 
ever, rather indigestible, and should be cooked, or very well chewed and eaten 
slowly. The meat of pigs is one of the most common smoked foods, and 
should always be cooked before eating, as it is apt to be more or less infected 
with a very small worm which will remain indefinitely in smoked meat, but 
which is destroyed by application of extreme heat. Smoked fish may be pre- 
pared in many attractive and tasty ways and are wholesome, strengthening and 
inexpensive foods. 

SOUPS. 

BARLEY. — In four quarts of water put two pounds of pieces of meat, 
a quarter of a pound of pearl barley, four chopped onions, salt and pepper, 
with a little parsley; let the whole simmer for three hours or more. This 
makes a very nutritious soup. 

BEAN SOUP. — Soak one and a half cups of dried beans overnight or for 
several hours in water to cover. Drain and put into a stewpan or kettle with 
two quarts of cold water, one small sliced onion and one small stalk of celery. 
Cook slowly for several hours, or till beans are very soft, adding more water 
as it boils away. Rub through a strainer, return to the kettle and when soup 
boils add seasoning, such as one-half teaspoonful of celery salt, one table- 
spoonful of salt, one-eighth teaspoonful of pepper, and thicken with three and 
one-half teaspoonfuls of flour mixed with a little cold water. 

BEEF SOUP. — Prepare the extract, add a glass of boiled milk, slightly 
thickened with flour (see that there are no lumps in it). Flavor with extract 
of celery. 

CHICKEN. — Take a chicken weighing about three pounds. Cut it into 
small pieces. Add two quarts cf water, and a cup of rice, and boil one hour. 
Add about one tablespoonful of chopped parsley, one onion and a small carrot 
in very thin slices. Boil the giblets separately, and make a gravy by adding 
a half-cup of water, one tablespoonful of flour, and the giblets chopped fine. 
Serve the gravy separately. 

CREAM OF TOMATO.— Take one-hall can of hot strained tomato, or 
one and a half cans fresh stewed and strained tomato. Scald one quart of milk 
and thicken with four tablespoonfuls of flour mixed with a pint of water in 
which carrots were cooked. Mix and cook over hot water twenty minutes, 
stirring constantly at first. Add three tablespoonfuls of butter, one-half table- 
spoonful of salt, and one-eighth teaspoonful of pepper. Strain and serve. 



134 DEPARTMENT OF COOKING AND FOODS 

LENTIL SOUP. — Wash and soak one cup of lentils; make like split pea 
soup. Put in two quarts of cold water, one-half small onion, three cups hot 
milk, two tablespoonfuls butter, two and a half tablespoonfuls of flour, one- 
half tablespoonful of salt, one-half teaspoonful of celery seed, and one-eighth 
of a teaspoonful of pepper. 

MULLIGATAWNY.— This Indian dish is admired by many. The meat 
may be either veal, rabbit or fowl. Get a knuckle of veal; have the bones 
cracked in two or three pieces; put it into a stewpan, cover it with water, and, 
when it is rather more than half done, cut off as much meat as you wish for 
the soup and boil the bones and the remainder of the meat well down to make 
stock soup. Let this stand until cold and then remove the fat. Cut the meat 
into small pieces and fry them in butter with four onions sliced and floured, 
two dessertspoonfuls of curry powder, a little cayenne pepper and salt; put 
these into stewpan; add the stock gravy with three or four cloves and a good 
tablespoonful of lemon juice; let the whole simmer for an hour and serve with 
plain boiled rice in a separate dish. 

MUTTON. — Select a nice shoulder of mutton and boil in two quarts of 
lukewarm water. When the meat is half-cooked add herbs tied in a coarse 
cloth; then add one pared turnip and some celery cut into small pieces; one 
carrot cut fine, one leek. When all is almost done, add two potatoes cut fine, 
and noodles or rivels, vermicelli or macaroni. Noodles are made nicely by 
breaking one egg into a cup of flour salted to taste, and mixing to a paste that 
can be rolled out very thin, and then placing before the fire until it is dry 
enough to cut into long strips. When tomatoes are liked, two raw ones, or 
half a can of canned ones, add very much, indeed, to the flavor and give it a 
much richer color. 

OYSTER SOUP.— Drain the liquor from fifty fresh oysters, and heat it 
slowly in a porcelain kettle; then heat two quarts of milk in a double boiler 
until it boils; let the liquor of the oysters boil, and put in the oysters as soon 
as boiled; add the milk at once and remove from the hot fire. Season with six 
whole-pod peppers, a little salt and butter. If the oysters are salts, care should 
be taken that the milk does not curdle. 

OKRA. — To five quarts of water and a shin of beef add four dozen okras, 
sliced thin, and a few tomatoes; boil from six to seven hours and add salt and 
pepper to taste. 

POTATO. — Wash and pare three medium-sized potatoes. Cook in a 
pint of boiling salted water until tender, drain and mash in the kettle in which 
they were cooked, add hot water, one-half tablespoonful of salt, one-eighth 
teaspoonful of pepper and one-half teaspoonful of celery salt. Scald one pint 
of milk and while scalding cook one slice of onion in it. Take out onion and 
add scalded milk to the soup. Mix two tablespoonfuls of flour with a little cold 
water and stir into the boiling soup. Let all boil for three or four minutes, 
stirring all the time. Add one-half tablespoonful of butter just before taking 
from the fire. 

SNAPPER. — Make, according to the quantity of snapper, a good stock 
from kunckles of veal and shins of beef. Kill and bleed the snapper and re- 
move the entrails. Take out the meat and eggs (if any), break the shells in 
pieces and put in the stock to boil. Then put in the snapper meat, and, when 
cooked, take it out, cut it in small pieces and set aside until wanted. Now add 
to the stock, tomatoes, onions in slices, and all kinds of sweet herbs. Boil well

We use only full-grown red-ripe tomatoes, ripened, on the vines — lus- 
cious, juicy perfect specimens. They are picked at sunrise — when cool and 
fresh ; brought to us direct from the New Jersey gardens — right near our 
plant ; washed five times in running water from artesian wells, and made into 
soup before noon. That's the story of 




Tomato 
Soup 



We not only take out all the skin and seeds, but we strain out every trace 
of the coarse indigestible core-fibre through our huge straining apparatus, 
built specially for this purpose, with a screen as fine as pin-points. There is 
no other way to do this important work so thoroughly. 

We use only the clear thick juice. And we retain all the fresh natural flavor and aroma. 
That is why Campbell's Tomato Soup comes steaming to your table so fragrant and spicy ; 
smooth as cream ; and with the most delicious smacking relish you ever tasted. And you prepare 
it in three minutes. 

Try it for dinner today. There are many dainty ways to serve it. Some of these are de- 
scribed in Campbell's Menu Book, of which we will gladly send you a copy free if you'll write

and strain off the stock, thicken with brown flour and season well with salt and 
pepper. If there are no eggs in the snapper add chicken eggs, a little flour and 
milk or water. When all is done flavor with brandy or Madeira wine. 

SPLIT PEA. — Boil one pint of peas in three quarts of water till they 
become broken to bits; add any vegetable that is liked one hour before the soup 
is to be served. The best peas require three and a half hours to cook them, 
One tablespoonful of olive oil will improve the soup. 

VEGETABLE. — Select a nice fresh soup bone, have it partly cracked 
or broken, put the meat into cold water about four hours before dinner and 
heat slowly; skim as soon as ready; add barley, keep the pot closely covered, 
and stew slowly for an hour. Prepare the vegetables, which will be four white 
potatoes sliced, a little cabbage, one carrot sliced fine, two turnips, one leek, 
and one stalk of celery cut fine; add rice, noodles or vermicelli. The potatoes 
and all but rice should be added last, when used. Corn cut from the ear and 
green peas can be used to suit the taste. 

VERMICELLI. — Take a shin of veal and put it in four quarts of water, 
adding one onion or leek, two carrots, two white turnips, and a little salt. 
Boil this three hours; add two cups of vermicelli, and boil it for an hour and a 
half longer. When ready for the table remove the bone. The vegetables may 
also be taken out and the broth served clear. 

SPINNACH. 

Pick off the stem of each leaf and use none that is old or yellow. Wash 
in several waters and put in water to cover. Add a teaspoonful of salt for each 
quarter-peck of spinnach, and boil for fifteen minutes. Drain, rinse with hot 
water, dish and serve with butter, vinegar and sliced hard-boiled egg. 

SQUASH. 

Peel, remove seeds and core and cut into one-inch pieces. Boil until ten- 
der in salted water with a little piece of fat pork. When tender, drain thor- 
oughly and mash through collander. Stir in a little butter and pepper and serve 
hot.

Cut grain from the cobs of half a dozen ears of corn and cook a little 
while; then add a pint of lima beans (which are best), or any green bean, and 
boil an hour in a quart of boiling water, with a little salt and pepper; let the 
water boil away until only a little remains; then add some milk, season with 
butter and serve in a hot dish.

lutely necessary to use a high-priced tea, but, as a rule, the higher priced tea 
has a finer flavor, and is little more expensive, as less is needed. To prepare tea, 
boil the water violently, throw in the tea leaves and remove at once. Allow 
the leaves to steep for five minutes before serving. 

TOMATOES. 

BAKED AND STUFFED.— Select firm, ripe tomatoes and cut off a thin 
slice from the stem end; remove the core and fill them with an onion chopped 
fine, a small piece of butter, pepper, salt, and a teaspoonful of cracker dust, or 
bread crumbs; arrange them in a baking pan; add a little water, and bake in a 
slow oven; serve them hot, in the pan or a warm dish. 

STEWED. — Scald some firm tomatoes and peel off the skin; place in a 
stewpan and cook slowly with a little water; when tender whip them fine, and 
season with butter, salt and pepper, and a little flour or cornstarch thickening. 
Serve while hot.

WATER. 

Liquids taken into the stomach are very quickly assimilated by the 
system, and for that reason are very quick transporters of disease germs. 
Perhaps more disease is taken into the system by water than any other means, 
and it is therefore very necessary to secure pure water for drinking. Water 
for cooking should also be pure, but as the cooking purifies to a great extent, 
it is not so immensely important as for drinking. City water supplies are 
bound to be more or less polluted, and drinking water should be boiled or 
distilled to be perfectly safe. House water stills and filters may be procured, 
which will furnish pure water for drinking and cooking at a very moderate cost. 

WHEAT. 

This great staple food source has many uses, and is excellent if properly 
prepared. The entire grain is a more complete food than flour, and may be 
served in many attractive forms. An excellent breakfast dish may be made by 
soaking selected and cleaned whole grains overnight. In the morning they will 
be swollen. Boil for half an hour in salted water and serve hot with sugar and 
cream. When the wheat gets cold it may be sliced down like mush and fried 
in butter cr cllvc cil.

Department of Education and Training 



ADULTS. 



TRAINING. — The training of ourselves and of each other never ceases, 
and especially at present there should be no let-up to self-improvement. 
Many a man, and woman, too, has been born into a poor family and been com- 
pelled to work and miss the school training that others have received. This 
does not in any way prevent them from securing it later in life, and they will 
be better for having to work harder to get it. Some of our very prominent men 
and women had little or no chance for education or improvement until they 
married, and many a man did not feel the need of it until he married and could 
not do all he would like to for his loved ones. There are really excellent night 
schools, business colleges and correspondent schools, where persons who are 
really anxious to acquire it may receive training for general improvement, or 
for some specific work. The writer has seen happy homes of young married 
couples where the evenings were spent in studying by correspondence. For 
married people, this is perhaps the most desirable method of adult training, as 
it does not necessitate absence from home, or loss of time from earning the 
daily bread. The man who spends his leisure hours in technical training along 
the lines of his chosen field of work, and secures employment in the practical 
part, perfects himself in both branches, and soon finds himself well up toward 
the "head-o'-the-heap." 

BOYS. 

TRAINING. — Whether the training of the boy should be most by the 
mother or father is a subject that has strong supporters on both sides, but it 
is so much influenced by the conditions that no decision could be arrived at 
that would be wise in every case. In our opinion, the safest plan to apply on 
the average is for the mother to have the actual training, under the advice of 
the father, but, in any event, there must be absolute confidence and freedom 
between all three. The father knows the feelings, temptations, trials and joys 
of boyhood, but he is away so much that he cannot keep in as close touch as 
the mother can, whose love and care will discern what may not be told her. 
It is natural for boys to be more active and full of life than girls, and those 
whose natural bent is allowed full sway except such restraint as will prevent 
them from acquiring bad habits will be the happiest boys, and the best and 
most successful men. Too great restraint makes boys deceitful, effeminate and 
backward. Upon those at home rests the inculcating of a sense of honor. Our 
public schools may show the boys some ways of being honest enough to keep 
out of jail, but they do nothing toward the moulding of character. Never 
promise a boy anything unless you keep your promise. Be a comrade to him. 
Enter fully into his undertakings and encourage him. Keep him clean and 
healthy. Give him something definite to do, so that he may learn responsibility. 
Try to patiently explain what puzzles him, even if you are compelled to study

it up for yourself. Confide in him, but make sure that he understands WHY 
you want him to do what you are asking. Reward him occasionally when par- 
ticularly successful and punish him in some way when radically wrong. Have 
his close friends and associates come freely to the house and study them. 
Find out from others how he does when out of your sight. Defend him in 
his right, but never uphold him if wrong. Be sure your judgment is correct, 
for injustice is blasting to boyhood. Cherish, love and care for him, but do not 
pet him too much, for he feels that you consider him a child. To make a boy 
feel manly is to make him manly. 

HABITS. — The particular habits that a boy is liable to get into are 
induced by his surroundings, examples set him, his companions, his inherited 
tendencies and the influence of those he admires or looks up to. It is ten 
times easier to PREVENT than to CURE habits, and for this reason we can- 
not urge too strongly upon parents the great importance of establishing from 
the very first a confidence and comradeship with the boys that will prevent 
them from hiding anything. Then the ever-watchfulness of the parents sees the 
tendency before it has become a fixed habit. Prevent them from acquiring 
the habits of selfishness, rudeness, uncleanness, deceit, lying, and immoral 
practices. These names sound harsh, but they are the extremes of the fixed 
habits. Every one of them starts in a way that is not at all horrible. When 
you find that a boy has a tendency toward a certain habit, do not go at him as 
though he were a hardened criminal, for he probably does not realize the im- 
portance of avoiding it, or has been led to do what he did by natural exuber- 
ance of spirits or in the excitement of the moment. Reason with him, show 
him why he is wrong, and be sure he understands you. Boys should never 
be punished unless you are convinced that the motive is wrong. Never punish 
a boy while you are angry, for if he is naturally manly, the first impulse will 
be to defend himself, and then you are really forcing him into the habit of 
impudence or are smothering his manliness. Explain freely to your boy the 
uses and abuses of all his organs, to help him avoid the awful habit of secret 
practices. Much may be done to prevent this by keeping his mind engaged 
on wholesome subjects, and by dieting him without his knowledge. These 
habits are so serious, both morally and physically, that we strongly advise par- 
ents who cannot control their boys in this respect to place them under the 
care of a physician.

GIRLS. 

INSTRUCTION AND TRAINING.— Unlike the boys, there is no room 
for argument as to which of the parents is more responsible for the moulding of 
a girl's character. This does not in any way mean that the father should lack 
interest or care in the girls, but when you see a well-behaved, good girl, you 
instinctively give the credit to the mother, and with the opposite kind you 
blame her. Girls are naturally of a more dependent disposition than boys, and 
should receive more affection. They are usually more nervous and should be 
dealt with less rigidly. As in case with the boys, they should have something 
definite to do, and learn to assume responsibility. The so-called "higher edu- 
cation" of young women is an excellent thing, and should be pursued as far as

possible, but we wish to say very strongly that WOMAN'S GREATEST 
WORK IN THE WORLD IS IN THE HOME. Here her education will be of 
no avail if she has sacrificed her health to it, or has neglected to train herself 
in the great art of home-making. It is not wrong or immodest for a girl to 
anticipate marriage, for that is her natural destiny, and the mother who helps 
her prepare herself to make married life happy is doing better for her than 
putting dollars in bank. Teach the girls to do everything that has to be done 
in a house, no matter whether you are rich or poor, for all may be compelled 
to do it some time, or at least must be able to direct others to do it properly. 
Because parents are well off is no reason for neglecting household training, 
for, since the days of "Mother Eve," women have followed their hearts in 
choosing a mate for life, and love may select for them a poor man, on whom 
they would be an insupportable burden if helpless in household affairs. Every 
girl should receive all the learning that her health will allow her, in addition 
to her home training, but of what value is her learning if she breaks her health? 
During the period when the girl is entering physical womanhood the strain 
upon her is severe, and doctors are coming more and more to realize that a 
year's rest from school at that age is more than paid for by the bettered physi- 
cal condition. Every girl should acquire what she can of a business education, 
for it will enable her to better deserve the confidence of her husband, and be 
able to help, advise and comfort him in his business affairs. Encourage the 
girls in outdoor exercise and sports. It is seldom that a "tomboy" retains any 
roughness after growing to womanhood. Allow her perfect freedom, under 
your guidance, with proper boy friends, but teach her to repel all freedom of 
both action and language. Meet her friends, be one of her comrades, love her, 
confide in her, and teach her that whether right or wrong you will always 
carefully consider her affairs, and that your judgment will be best and kindly. 

HABITS. — We do not like to think of girls having the more serious of 
the bad habits, and, as a rule, they have less of them, probably on account of 
the more consistent association with the mother. Probably one of the most 
common bad habits among girls is that of exaggeration of speech. This may 
be innocent enough at the start, but very quickly leads to lying. Many times 
a day perhaps you hear girls use such expressions as "dearest thing I ever saw," 
"never saw anything like it in my life," "everybody is wearing this" and nu- 
merous other superlative expressions which must be untrue, for there can be 
but one superlative. Girls who get into the habit of using such expressions 
quickly lose the definite value of truth, and their statements become less valu- 
able. Another bad habit among girls is that of improper eating. They neglect 
proper foods, and want to be constantly nibbling at some dainty or highly- 
flavored stuff, and this develops the detestable chewing-gum habit. This gum 
has a use, medicinally, but the habit of chewing it incessantly is abominable. 
The same tendency that makes girls extravagant in expressions tends toward 
making them extravagant in all things. It is almost universal with girls to imi- 
tate in styles of clothing those with whom they associate, and this often 
leads them into expense beyond the means of their parents. Teach them to 
be satisfied with their lot. Those who are trained to do and be satisfied with 
what they have can always appreciate more, but those who are dissatisfied with 
what is proper for them will never be satisfied with anything they have. Girls 
are of a sensitive physique, and this in some cases leads them into neglect of 
the body. Even more so with girls than with boys must the mother enjoy 
the full confidence of the child to avoid immoral tendencies. The apparently 
harmless flirting of girls may lead to very embarrassing predicaments, if not 



DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION AND TRAINING 145 

worse. Make friends with her boy friends, keep eternal watch over her with- 
out making it objectionable; reason with her, but be firm. The gallantry of 
the present day forbids a man from too strenuously opposing a lady, and this 
often leads them to presume upon their rights and tends them toward the 
habits of domineering and inconsiderateness. Prevent them from becoming 
the slaves of fashion, either in dress or in habits. A well-trained, naturally 
good girl is one of the most admirable things on earth, and a monument to 
those responsible for her, and a bad girl is adjudged even worse than a bad 
boy.

Introduction 



TO 



Department of Health and Hygiene 



In this work we do not undertake to give 
such information as will make the consultation 
of a physician unnecessary, although in some 
minor cases it may do so. 

Our greatest object is to give advice that 
will give temporary relief to suffering, take 
the first step in the right direction, and make the 
work of the doctor easier and quicker. 

In cases where poisons or strong drugs are 
suggested, we urge the greatest care. Great 
care should also be used in labeling such reme- 
dies plainly and keeping them out of the reach 
of children. 

This being a book for city folks, a physician 
may be summoned very quickly in case of need. 



Department of Health and Hygiene 



ACCIDENTS. 



BLEEDING. — Loss of blood may result from external injury, or from 
disease, but in either case it should be promptly attended to, as it results in 
great weakness. Bleeding internally or from the nose slightly is not neces- 
sarily serious, and is in many cases nature doctoring itself in this manner, 
as there are certain troubles where loss of blood is beneficial. In cases of re- 
peated or continued bleeding, a physician should be consulted. Bleeding from 
the lungs usually indicates consumption or like causes. Bleeding from the 
stomach indicates ulcers there, while passing blood in the stools may indicate 
ulcers on the bowels, or piles. In accidents or severe bleeding, knowledge and 
quick action are necessary. The treatments we give here are merely tem- 
porary measures while the doctor is coming. In severe bleeding from the 
lungs, apply cold, wet towels, or cracked ice in cloth to the back and chest, 
and let the patient inhale the fumes of turpentine from soaked cotton. In 
profuse bleeding from the stomach, give tannin in water and have the patient 
suck ice. If from the bowels, apply cold externally, and inject ice water. 
If from the nose, apply cold to back of the neck, and inhale turpentine. 
Where severe bleeding comes from a wound, it is very essential to check it 
at once. This can only be done by applying pressure to the vein or artery 
above the wound. A man's pocket handkerchief, folded to about an inch and 
a half square, makes a good pad. Apply pressure by the hand above the 
wound, and when the vein or artery is located by a cessation of bleeding, apply 
the pad and bandage very tightly. In many cases it is necessary to use a 
tourniquet or stick under the strap or bandage, twisting it and increasing 
the pressure until the bleeding ceases. 

When the flow is practically or entirely stopped, apply a very clean pad 
and bandage to the wound until medical aid may be had. For bleeding from 
the forehead or scalp, apply pressure on the temples. For the face, apply it 
on the back point of the jaw bone. For the neck or head, at the centre of 
the throat, taking care to avoid the windpipe. For the upper arm, just above 
the biceps muscles, in front. For the hand, right above the elbow, or on both 
sides the inside wrist. For the leg, as close to the body as possible, applying 
a large pad to the front of the leg near the inside. For the shin and foot, 
just above the knee. For the top of the foot, on the top of the instep, and for 
the sole of the foot, just below the ankle bones. Do not apply any drugs, 
powders or lotions to the cut, simply stop the blood until the doctor comes. 

BROKEN BONES. — When bones are broken a temporary splint should 
be made, the limb should be gently but firmly pulled cut if the broken ends 
have become overlapped by pressure, and the injured limb fastened firmly to the 
splint to prevent further damage by motion. If possible, the patient should be 
kept perfectly still, even after a splint is applied, for the muscles about the 



148 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 

wound are very sensitive and active, and any motion causes irritation that de- 
lays healing and often has serious consequences. If the patient must be taken 
away for treatment, prevent all possible motion by binding the corresponding 
limb, viz., if a finger, bind the entire arm; if an arm, bind both; if a leg, bind 
both. If the skin is torn and the bone protruding, wash the end of the bone 
and the wound immediately in a warm, strong solution of peroxide of hydro- 
gen. Then draw the limb carefully to position, apply pad and bandage to stop 
bleeding, and bind firmly to splint. 

To prevent the parts becoming seriously diseased, all haste must be 
made for medical aid in cases where the skin is burst or the muscles badly 
torn by the broken bone. 

BURNS. — The pain from these wounds is very severe, and they are 
dangerous if extensive. If a person's clothing takes fire they, or someone, 
should endeavor to smother it out by wrapping something around them and 
rolling over and over quickly. Woolen articles serve this purpose best, such 
as shawls, blankets, rugs or carpets. Then water should be poured liberally 
over the patient. If very badly burned, a few drops of laudanum or a hypoder- 
mic should be administered to prevent further damage by the struggles of the 
sufferer, or greater shock to the nerves by the intense pain. Temporary relief 
may be had by bathing the patient in sweet oil and wrapping in a sheet. As 
a local treatment for slight burns, including sunburn, apply rags wet with a 
strong solution of baking soda. If the burns are severe, cleanse well with 
peroxide of hydrogen, and then with a salt solution. If blistered, puncture 
with antiseptic needle. After cleansing, apply boric acid powder and cover 
with absorbent cotton. Carbolized sweet oil may also be used. 

CUTS. — Where not serious enough to require a doctor, cleanse the 
wound thoroughly with solution of hydrogen peroxide, removing all foreign 
matter very carefully. Then rinse many times with warm salt solution and 
bandage so that the sides of the cut are pressed tightly together. After 
twenty-four hours, wash surface with salt solution, apply vaseline to the scar 
and re-bandage. 

DROWNING. — In rescuing drowning persons, avoid the fatal death 
grip. Seize them from behind if possible, by hair or collar. It has been nec- 
essary in some cases for the rescuer to strike a severe blow and render the 
victim unconscious. As soon as a place of safety is reached, remove every- 
thing binding from the neck, lay the person on the stomach over a barrel, 
log or such, force open the mouth and pull out the tongue with a dry cloth. 
Then exert pressure on the back to expel water and mucus from mouth and 
throat and as much from lungs as possible. Then lay on the back with 
blanket, coat or roll of something under the shoulders, grasp the arms at the 
elbows and raise above the head until they almost meet. Hold in this posi- 
tion for three seconds, then place the arms close to the sides, pressing the 
elbows tightly against the lower chest. These motions cause artificial breath- 
ing, and should be made about fifteen times each minute. If not successful 
at once, move the arms more rapidly until the patient breathes naturally, and 
then slower and slower until they become conscious. Persons have been 
revived in this way who have been in the water for nearly half an hour, and 
who showed no sign of life for the first fifteen minutes of treatment. As soon 
as the patient becomes conscious, administer stimulants, wrap in dry, warm 
blankets or clothing, feed hot gruels and broths, and keep quiet for a few 
hours.

A DRUGSTORE 

It is not to be forgotten 
that this establishment is 

first and foremost a drugstore. 

We never for one moment lose sight 
of the fact that this business— founded over 
half a century ago— was based and has 
been built upon the accurate compounding 
of physicians' prescriptions and the use of 
absolutely pure drugs in doing so. 

We realize, of course, that "drugstore" has 
come to be an elastic word, covering a multitude 
of merchandise. We ourselves sell a good many 
things besides drugs. But in everything that makes 
a drugstore in the strictest sense we adhere with 
exactness to the old standards that have made our 
store a household word in Philadelphia for more 
than 50 years. 

After all, this is just a drugstore. 

And it's a just drugstore, too. 

Will you not bring to us the next prescription you 
wish filled.

FIRE.— See "Burns" and "To Prevent Fire." 
NEED OF POLICE— See Index. 

SPRAIN. — These injuries are often more serious than at first appear, 
sometimes being more so than broken bones. The patient should keep per- 
fectly quiet, and if the sprain is in the ankle it should be elevated above the 
hip. Ice water should be applied on tight bandages, and the affected part 
kept as cold as possible. If very much swollen and black, apply leeches. Alco- 
hol and water is very cooling and beneficial for sprains. 

SUNSTROKE. — Place the victim in cool, shaded place or darkened 
room, and apply first hot and then cold alternately to the forehead and base 
of the brain or back of the neck. Place the feet in warm mustard water, and 
apply mustard plaster to the abdomen and calves of the legs. If unconscious, 
stimulants may be administered by injection, if conscious, in slight doses by 
the mouth. 

ADULTS' DIET. 

This subject is too large a one to be treated here, and one that should 
be taken up with your doctor if the dieting is for the purpose of affecting any 
disease. There are certain conditions, however, that may be corrected or pro- 
duced by dieting. Persons whose daily lives are spent indoors should avoid 
stimulants and heavy foods. Stout persons should avoid fatty and starchy 
foods, while thin persons should use them. Acids and sour things reduce fat 
and thin the blood. More people suffer from over-eating than from the oppo- 
site. This they may do and still not eat much, for the foods they choose may 
be too rich and strong for their work to use up. 

ANTIDOTES FOR POISONS. 

Persons may be seriously poisoned and not have swallowed the poison, 
as many may be taken through the skin, inhaled in the breath or injected by 
bites, stings or wounds. Nature makes strenuous efforts to drive poison from 
the system, and if swallowed it usually shows itself soon by extreme pain, 
vomiting and purging. It is also indicated by convulsions, paralysis, delirium 
or drowsiness. If poison is suspected get a doctor at once, as some of them 
act fatally in a very short time. 

In the meantime, some of the following treatments may save life or 
ease suffering. Act quickly: a poor remedy immediately is better than a good 
one later on. First get rid of the poison by causing hard vomiting and severe 
purging. Do this whether the patient is already doing so or not. In cases 
already throwing off the poison, salt and lukewarm water are emetics. Mix 
a half-cup of salt in a pint of lukewarm water. Give the patient all this and 
as much more warm water as they can force down. In cases where this fails 
to cause free vomiting, dissolve a tablespoonful of mustard in a pint of warm 
water and administer like the salt. Extreme vomiting is often very weaken- 
ing, and should be followed with small and frequent doses of stimulants. After 
the stomach is entirely empty, give milk, eggs beaten in milk, or sweet oil. In 
cases where the cause of the trouble is known, antidotes may be given to neu- 
tralize the effects of the poison as follows: 

AQUA FORTIS. — Give magnesia or soap, dissolved in water; every 
two minutes. Get a doctor.

CAUSTIC POTASH. — Drink freely of water with vinegar or lemon 
juice in it. Send for the doctor.

CLOTHING. 

ADULTS. — Popular clamor for existing styles, especially in America, is 
largely responsible for some forms of clothing that are positively detrimental 
to health. This usually takes the form of improper protection against the 
elements, or an improper binding of the muscles or organs. Tight lacing of 
the body should be avoided, and experience has proven that women may attain 
and retain a beautiful shape without stays or corsets by careful living and 
proper physical exercise. Tight shoes cause diseases of the feet, lack of cir- 
culation, and by causing the wearer to walk unnaturally and with muscles 
strained, may cause trouble in other parts of the body. Fresh air should be 
allowed free access to our skin often, taking care to prevent colds. Persons 
leading an inactive life are particularly subject to changes of the weather, and 
should change the weight of their clothing accordingly. 

CHILDREN.— See "Department of Children." 

INVALIDS. — Persons in poor health have not the natural stamina for 
resisting the elements that healthy persons have, and should therefore be 
clothed with much more care. Few invalids suffer with much fever, and as a

rule are cold, and need considerable clothing. Others perspire freely from 
weakness. In any event, wool is adjudged the best clothing, both for under- 
wear, outside garments and wraps. 

MEN'S WEAR. — While there may be many cases where cost is a strong 
factor, this is one particular kind of clothing where quality and care are partic- 
ularly valuable. As men's wear we do not mean outer clothing, but rather 
such goods as are often classed as furnishings. It is so easy for manufacturers 
and dealers to break into this line of goods, that many take advantage of the 
comparatively small cost of each article to offer to the buying public unworthy 
or imperfect goods. The most economical way is to select a reliable house, 
pay a fair price for good articles, and then by care to make them last long 
enough to be less expensive in the end than cheaper and inferior goods. Under- 
clothing and hosiery should be washed often, and it will not be necessary to 
wash them hard enough to wear them out. Keeping the articles in place and 
order will lengthen their life, and in the dozens of ways that will suggest them- 
selves, a little care and trouble will do more than money paid out continually 
for new goods. 

COMPLEXION. 

The complexion is the most important item in what goes to make 
beauty in woman, and it is her duty to treasure it and care for it. By this is 
not meant to use any artificial means, such as paint or powder, for these do 
not deceive anyone, lower the wearer in the opinion of thinking people, and 
ruin what beauty nature has given the skin. A beautiful complexion will 
atone for features that are far from perfect, but the loveliest form and fea- 
tures are marred by a poor complexion. Evident health and cleanliness are 
the two great items in making a beautiful skin. This means a great deal to 
the busy housewife, and yet it can be done if she wants to badly enough, and 
will repay her many times. The hair should be healthy, clean, natural and 
well kept. The general physical condition must be brought and kept up to 
the highest standard. Careful selections of foods are very important. Many 
a woman sacrifices her beauty to her appetite by eating hot bread, cakes, rich 
foods, pastry and candies. These must be used very moderately, if at all, by 
the woman who is to be beautiful. Drink lots of the purest water you can 
secure. Flush the system with it. Exercise regularly. Many busy women 
claim that they get enough exercise at their work, but this is not the kind that 
helps. 

Exercise for health must be taken especially for that purpose. Prob- 
ably walking is the best. Prepare for it by removing corsets or any binding 
clothing, and dress in short skirt, heavy shoes and such light clothing that 
you would be cool unless walking. Then walk briskly, if only for fifteen min- 
utes, in the locality where the purest air may be found that is convenient, and 
when you return, sponge off with warm water and good soap, and then with 
cold water followed by hard rubbing. Above all, do not neglect the care of 
your face and hands. These parts, being exposed to the constant soil of the 
city air become dirtier than any other part. Cold water and soap will not 
properly remove this coating. Rub some good cream into the skin with an 
upward circular motion and rub off with turkish towel. Then bathe the face 
carefully with warm water and good soap, using a soft wash rag. After that 
wash with cold water to close the pores and rub in a little flesh food. Manicure 
the nails carefully and keep the hands as much protected from dirt as possible.

DIET. 

IN SICKNESS.— The dieting of the patient should be entirely left to 
the physician who knows the needs of the individual under the existing con- 
ditions. It need not cause worry if practically no food is given during the 
first two or three days, especially in fever diseases, as a person's vitality usually 
will sustain them without damage for that length of time. Where the illness 
continues, nourishment should be given, even though the patient has no desire 
for it, for the fatality is largely from exhaustion, which may be prevented 
by proper nourishment. 

TO DECREASE WEIGHT.— Dieting to decrease weight does not 
mean simply to lose flesh. This could be accomplished by starving. Suc- 
cessful dieting of this kind should remove surplus fats and harden the muscles 
so that no USELESS flesh is carried. This can best be accomplished if the 
dieting is accompanied by proper physical exercise. Drink a great deal of 
water, flushing the bowels often, and keep them moving freely by eating fruits, 
and foods of an acid nature. Eat less than is customary of strong foods, such 
as steaks, fish-foods, nuts, etc. Avoid fat meats, gravy, sweets, pastry and 
starchy foods, such as potatoes. If possible, eat whole-wheat bread, cereals 
and skimmed milk. Careful dieting and exercise will reduce weight and in- 
crease strength at the same time. In addition to outdoor exercise, special 
exercises of the abdomen and body should be taken to reduce internal fat. 
Frequent hot or steam baths followed by cold, and hard rubbing, will aid in 
producing the desired effect. 

TO INCREASE WEIGHT.— Eat plentifully of strong, rich foods and 
exercise regularly and violently enough to create an appetite. Drink plenty 
of rich milk and eat plenty of rice, oats, bread and butter, meats, oils, potatoes 
and appetite-producing condiments. Avoid worry and nervousness, and be 
cheerful and happy. This treatment will add healthy weight evenly, and not 
simply put on fat in certain places. 

TO PRODUCE STRENGTH.— The treatment given for dieting for in- 
creased weight will also produce strength, but in training for strength without 
weight, the starchy foods should be greatly reduced, meals should be frequent, 
regular and small. Meats should be mostly lean and rare. Condiments and 
stimulants should be dropped entirely, and physical exercise and cold bathing 
increased. Regular hours of rest, and plenty of sleep are necessary. Food 
should be well chewed. 

DISEASES 

ABSCESS. — Apply equal parts rosin and sugar for several days, if net 
broken then, apply hot flaxseed meal poultices every hour until broken. 

AGUE. — Dose with quinine as much as patient can take. Remain in 
even temperature. Drink hot drinks. Mix equal parts of turpentine and chlor- 
oform, and apply to spine from shoulder down, and across the small of the 
back. 

ALCOHOLISM. — This awful disease is the result of indulging the appe- 
tite for strong drink which grows into the worst physical curse known, for it 
not only ruins the health, but it degrades the character, destroys genius, en- 
genders selfishness and brutality, ruins social standing, dulls the conscience 
and destroys the will, leaving its victim a most pitiable object. Employers are 
fast coming to realize the commercial value of temperance, and many of them,

even saloonkeepers, will not employ a drinking man. More can be accom- 
plished in fighting this terrible curse by religious and moral influence than in 
any other way, but these may be aided by medical treatment. Those whose 
systems are saturated with alcohol will often suffer severe physical ills after 
its use is discontinued, for the system is not receiving its usual amount of 
stimulant, and must outgrow its diseased condition before it can resume its 
normal functions. Where the victim is suffering from recent excesses, give a 
strong emetic and follow with active purgative. This will remove the unab- 
sorbed alcohol. Give three drops tincture nux vomica in teaspoonful of com- 
pound tincture cinchona every three hours. 

ANEMIA. — This is caused by loss of or impoverished blood, and takes 
the form of general weakness, dizziness, and languidness. The patient should 
be fed on gruels, broth and other strengthening and easily digested foods, and 
the body should be sponged morning and evening with a solution of rock salt 
and whiskey. Give four grains reduced iron and a half a grain quinine three 
or four times daily. 

APOPLEXY. — This disease comes on quickly or in "strokes" in its 
best known form. The neck should be freed from any binding cloths, and 
cups or leeches quickly applied to the back of the neck. This will help to 
remove the excess of clotted blood which has caused the trouble. The head 
should be kept raised and cool. Injections or laxatives should be used until 
bowels are empty. 

APPENDICITIS. — For this very serious and often fatal disease, most 
doctors use the knife, generally to good effect, but many also prefer cure by 
absorption. A physician should be procured at once, as every moment counts 
*in the race for life. Put fifteen drops of turpentine on a woolen rag, wring 
out of hot water and apply to sore spot very hot. When relieved cover bowels 
with cloth wrung out of kerosene oil. The liver should be kept active. 

ASTHMA. — Make strong solution of saltpetre, saturate pieces of blot- 
ting paper and dry them. When a paroxysm is felt ignite a piece of the paper 
and inhale the smoke. This acts most quickly, alleviating distressing symp- 
toms and shortens the paroxysm. 

BALDNESS. — To prevent baldness and to secure the remaining hair, 
dissolve an ounce of powdered quinine in a quart of whiskey and rub well into 
the scalp every other night before retiring. From six to fifteen applications 
will usually stop falling hair. 

Baldness can hardly be regarded as a disease; but undoubtedly it is a 
source of much discomfort, not to say annoyance, to many people. It is diffi- 
cult to say from what it arises. It has been thought to be due to the custom 
of wearing smoking caps or tightly fitting hats; but this is a theory as difficult 
to prove as to disprove. People who are bald are naturally very liable to colds 
in the head, with all their attendant disadvantages. There are many widely 
advertised remedies; but it cannot be said for most of them that the results 
experienced are equal to those promised. A safe application is pure terebene, 
which should be rubbed into the scalp night and morning. 

BEDSORES. — Bedsores are apt to be a source of great trouble and dan- 
ger to those confined to bed for any length of time as a result of illness or 
accident. From pressure on the part, the skin loses its vitality and gives rise 
to an ulcer, which goes on increasing in size and depth day by day. The 
strength of the patient, already undermined by disease, is rapidly exhausted, 



DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 159 

and the prospects of recovery are materially diminished. When a person is 
likely to be long confined to bed a water-pillow should be provided from the 
very first. A feather bed is always out of the question, and can only do harm. 
Before the skin is broken it is a good plan to rub the part night and morning 
with strong spirits, such as brandy, but when once a sore is formed this is im- 
possible, and it is safer to rely on a dusting powder applied lightly once or 
twice a day. Powdered starch and oxide of zinc is a good dusting powder. 

BILIOUSNESS. — This trouble is usually due to congestion of the liver, 
and is shown by coated tongue, lack of appetite, bad breath and constipation. 
A listlessness and general depression is felt. Small doses of calomel and 
strong purgatives should be taken. Drink plenty of water and aperient waters, 
and avoid rich foods and stimulants. 

BLEEDING.— See "Accidents." 

BOILS. — The best way of managing a boil is to poultice it with flax- 
seed or bread and milk containing laudanum to ease the pain. If the boil is 
small, the poultice may be spread upon a piece of oiled silk, which prevents it 
from becoming dry, and held in place by a bandage, or by a square piece of 
linen upon each corner of which has been daubed a little spot of adhesive 
plaster, the stick of plaster being melted in the flame of a candle for the pur- 
pose. This holds a dressing of any kind on a broad, flat surface of the body, 
as, for instance, the skin of the back, very satisfactorily. 

When the boil softens in the centre, and the fluctuation of matter can be 
detected, or its yellowish color can be seen under the skin, some twenty-four 
hours of suffering may be saved by having it lanced, and the pain of the cut 
may be abolished by freezing the surface with ether spray, or by stroking it 
with a little bag containing a mixture of ice and salt. In certain cases it is 
important to lance a boil early, so as to prevent the burrowing of the pus 
toward some important structure, but ordinarily, if the sufferer dreads the 
knife, there is no actual necessity for using it, and the boil may safely be left 
to break of its own accord, under the poultice, one, two or three days later 
than the time when it is ripe for lancing. 

BROKEN BONES.— See "Accidents." 

BRONCHITIS. — Bronchitis occurs in two forms, the acute and the 
chronic. Acute bronchitis is always dangerous, especially in the case of chil- 
dren, and necessitates the immediate attendance of a doctor. Chronic bron- 
chitis, although less dangerous, is of much longer duration and may persist for 
years. It occurs chiefly in middle-aged people, both men and women. It at- 
tacks them only during the winter months. The symptoms usually are cough, 
which is worse in the morning; expectoration, which is very profuse; and 
shortness of breath on exertion, which is always very distressing. One of the 
best remedies is chloride of ammonia tabloids, each containing three grains. 
Tar is another good remedy. It may be used either in the form of tar water, 
or in the form of tar tabloids. Pure terebene has long had a reputation for 
the relief of the cough and shortness of breath caused by this complaint. The 
pure terebene may be taken internally or it may be inhaled from a pocket 
handkerchief. 

BRUISES. — Apply cloths dipped in cold water to injured parts, and 
bathe with tincture of arnica. If severe, causing fever, give aconite. A tinc- 
ture half glycerine and half cayenne pepper will remove discoloration. 



160 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 

BUNIONS. — These troublesome growths are usually incurable, but may 
be relieved by painting with iodine twice a day. Or, mix a teaspoonful salicylic 
acid with two tablespoonfuls of lard and apply morning and night, covering 
with adhesive plaster. 

BURNS— See "Accidents." 

CARBUNCLE. — Carbuncles chiefly differ from boils in the large area 
involved in the inflammation, from which a core of dead connective tissue, 
called a "slough," several inches in diameter, may come away. Carbuncles are 
apt to come on the nape of the neck, and on the back, but may appear on any 
part of the body. A large carbuncle will sometimes keep a patient in bed for 
a month or six weeks, and the pain and exhausting discharge wears cut the 
strength so much that it may cause death. Use poultices of flaxseed meal, 
bread and milk, powdered slippery elm bark, or of yeast. Give anodynes to 
relieve pain; and six grains of quinine daily, with other tonics to support the 
strength. Early and free incisions into the inflamed tissue, made after freez- 
ing the part, are probably of great service. 

CHAPPED HANDS OR FACE.— Make a lotion of ten drops tincture 
benzoin, a half drachm rose water, two drachms alcohol and one ounce of 
glycerine. Wash the chapped surfaces with warm water and soap, dry thor- 
oughly and rub the lotion in lightly on retiring. 

CHILBLAINS. — Chilblains occur most frequently in young girls who 
have a weak circulation, as evidenced by the cold hands and cold feet, espe- 
cially in the morning before breakfast. They are usually worse in the winter, 
and not infrequently are more painful in damp weather. They may be treated 
by local applications, such as lanoline, or lanoline cream, but the tendency of 
their recurrence will not be eradicated until constitutional treatment is resorted 
to. Tonics such as quinine should be given freely. Beef, iron and wine is a 
most useful remedy, and the best plan is to give half a wineglass twice a day. 
When this preparation has been taken for three or four weeks, quinine may 
be substituted for a week or two, and then another trial be made of the wine. 
This course of treatment should be kept up with very little intermission for at 
least six months. 

CHOLERA INFANTUM.— See "Department of Children." 

COLD IN THE HEAD.— The symptoms of a cold in the head are, usu- 
ally, running from the eyes and nose, accompanied by sneezing, headache, de- 
pression, and, perhaps, loss of appetite and constipation. The condition may 
pass away without active treatment. One of the best remedies for cutting 
short an attack is menthol snuff, which is supplied in a little snuff-box, so as 
to be readily available for use. Frequently the internal administration of iodide 
of potassium does good. 

COLIC. — See "Department of Children." 

CONSTIPATION. — The treatment given for this disease in the "De- 
partment of Children" may be applied to adults, but usually in stronger form. 
When constipation threatens to become chronic it is wise to consult your 
doctor, for early treatment lessens suffering and accomplishes more. 

CONSUMPTION. — This is to-day one of the most fearful diseases 
known, as it claims more victims each year than any other. Its early growth 
is so insidious and so much resembles common colds that few people give it 
proper attention until it has gained such headway that it cannot be overcome.

There is no doubt that CONSUMPTION IS CONTAGIOUS, and is gaining 
rapidly. The only hope of the world being rid of this awful scourge is to 
arouse the public to their danger and get them into a crusade against it that 
will popularize right methods of living, proper ventilation, proper exercise and 
immediate treatment of suspects and at least partial isolation of diagnosed 
cases. 

CONSUMPTION IS CURABLE, at least in its earlier stages, and any 
suspicion of its presence should be run out until it is proven whether the dis- 
ease is present or not. When you consider that after the disease reaches a 
certain stage it is equal to a death sentence, there should be no trifling with it. 
There have been some well authenticated cases of cures, even in the later 
stages, and in "hasty" or "galloping" consumption, but they are very rare. 
DO NOT NEGLECT COLDS, as these are in most cases the seed from which 
the dread disease grows. It is now the generally accepted theory that con- 
sumption is a germ disease, that the germs are extremely prolific, and that 
we are constantly taking them into our system. As long as we are healthy 
and strong, nature's own police force keeps them from doing harm, but 
when these guards of our body are weakened by disease, the germs make 
progress. While you may apparently recover fully, the colony of germs is 
there, and gains a little every time you are ill or out of condition, and finally 
wins the mastery. This may take only a month or two, or it may take years, 
but the result is eventually the same. More can be done by PREVENTING 
CONSUMPTION than by curing it, and this can only be done by keeping 
strong and well enough to resist the ever-present germs. Pure air, pure water, 
regular bowels, good food, proper exercise, regular habits, and absence of 
alcohol, all in their proper place, time and proportion, will keep a person in such 
physical condition that the disease cannot get a serious hold on the system. 
Sleeping in the open air or open rooms, plenty of eggs and milk, regular, easy 
outdoor exercises and non-alcoholic stimulants are all good treatments if com- 
menced soon enough. 

CONVULSIONS.— See "Department of Children." 

CORNS. — Corns are similar to warts in their structure, except that 
they have a much thicker layer of epidermis over their surface. They are 
almost always produced by the pressure of tight shoes, and may be avoided 
by caution in this respect. They can be prevented from giving much trouble 
by carefully trimming out the centre of the corn at short intervals, or by wear- 
ing one of the various forms of perforated corn plasters in common use. In 
cutting corns, the incision should never go through the epidermis to cause 
bleeding, as dangerous inflammation may result. Often filing a groove across 
the top of a corn answers every purpose, and is not attended with any risk. 

COUGH. — The following four remedies for coughs and colds have 
proven successful in many cases. If one does not give relief, try another, but 
do not neglect yourself, for in these common and often unnoticed diseases lies 
the root of consumption. Three grains of camphor on sugar, taken every two 
hours, and inhalation of spirits of camphor every half-hour quickly relieves; or, 
flaxseed tea, made in the proportion of one ounce of grains of flaxseed to a 
pint and a half of water, boiled down to a pint, with the addition of a little 
lemon peel, a wineglassful taken every two or three hours, is a most excellent 
remedy; or, an infusion of boneset tea, made with two ounces of boneset, boiled 
in a pint of water and given in tablespoonful doses every three hours, speedily 
breaks up a cold; or, the juice of one lemon sweetened to taste, to which has

been added a teaspoonful of sweet spirits of nitre, is decidedly effective. Dose: 
Half-teaspoonful every two or three hours. 

CRAMPS. — Make mustard poultice, with white of egg instead of water, 
apply it to bowels, and give a tablespoonful of blackberry tea, made from the 
root, every fifteen or twenty minutes until relieved. 

CROUP.— See "Department of Children." 

CUTS.— See "Accidents." 

DANDRUFF. — Dandruff is a scurfy or scaly condition of the scalp, 
which occurs in the course of many diseases of the scalp, such as eczema and 
ringworm. It cannot be regarded as a disease itself, but is simply an indica- 
tion of some unhealthy condition. It is a source of annoyance to the individual 
who suffers from it, chiefly from the fact that the minute white particles come 
off on the coat or dress, and attract attention. It is not very difficult to cure, 
and a few applications of lanoline cream night and morning will usually effect 
the desired object. Hazeline, mixed with an equal quantity or eau de Cologne, 
may also be used to advantage. The head and hair should be washed once a 
week with lanoline soap and water, but it is not advisable to use cosmetics. 
The general condition of the health may be improved by a course of extract of 
malt or some other similar remedy. 

DEAFNESS. — Deafness, when due to disease of the internal ear, is a 
condition which medicines are powerless to alleviate. When, however, it is 
associated with some obstruction in the external passages, such as may be 
produced by an accumulation of wax, syringing may afford prompt relief. 
Syringing, to be of any avail, must be performed thoroughly, soap and hot 
water being used for the purpose. When the deafness is due to perforation or 
collapse of the tympanic membrane, an artificial ear-drum may be resorted to 
with good results. These ear-drums are sold in boxes containing a probe and 
forceps for their introduction. After a few lessons from an expert the suf- 
ferer soon learns how to use them. They materially improve the hearing pow- 
ers, as they serve to convey the waves of sound to the internal structures. 
When in use they are invisible. 

In cases of throat deafness much benefit may be derived from the sys- 
tematic employment of the chloride of ammonium inhaler. If there seems to 
be reason to suppose that the deafness is due to or is associated with a condi- 
tion of general debility, a course of hypophosphites may prove beneficial. 

DIABETES. — There are two kinds of diabetes, one in which there is 
sugar in the urine, and another in which urine is passed in very large quanti- 
ties, but is free from the presence of sugar, or of any other abnormal con- 
stituent. The form or variety known technically as diabetes mellitus is not 
only the more common but the more important. It attacks men more fre- 
quently than women. The onset of the disease is often curious. A man finds 
his health and strength are failing him without any appreciable reason, and on 
consulting a physician his urine is found to be highly concentrated, and to con- 
tain a large percentage of sugar. One of the most constant symptoms of the 
disease is extreme muscular weakness. There is an enormous increase in appe- 
tite, so that the patient is not only always eating, but always feels hungry. An- 
other important symptom is excessive thirst, so that the patient may drink 
twenty pints of water in twenty-four hours. The bowels are constantly con- 
fined, the skin is dry and parched, boils are all over the body and a carbuncle 
often develops on the nape of the neck. As the disease develops the lungs 
become affected with chronic consumption. Diabetes is a disease of most seri- 



DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 165 

ous import, but a great deal may be done by judicious dieting. Almost all 
kinds of animal foods, flesh, fish and fowl may be eaten. All articles of food 
containing even a trace of starch or sugar must be carefully avoided; bread, 
for example, contains starch and must not be eaten. Potatoes also contain 
starch. 

DIARRHOEA.— See "Department of Children." 

DIPHTHERIA.— See "Department of Children." 

DROPSY. — By the term dropsy is meant the accumulation of fluid 
under the skin, or in one of the large cavities of the body, such as the abdomen 
or thorax. It is not to be regarded as a disease in itself, but simply as a symp- 
tom or indication of the existence of some deep-seated morbid condition; for 
example, it is one of the commonest symptoms of Bright's disease of the kid- 
neys, and is often associated with heart disease, especially in young people. It 
is not infrequently the immediate cause of death in people who indulge too 
freely in alcoholic beverages. It is impossible to lay down any general rules 
with regard to treatment, as that will of necessity depend on the condition 
from which the dropsy arises. 

DROWNING.— See "Accidents." 

DYSENTERY. — Dysentery is due in some cases to exposure to cold, 
but a much more common cause is bad drinking water. Sometimes it is asso- 
ciated with an attack of ague, and the two combined constitute a grave and 
serious illness. It usually comes on suddenly, one of the prominent symptoms 
being diarrhoea, accompanied with griping and straining. The motions gen- 
erally contain blood in large quantities, a circumstance which readily distin- 
guishes it from the common or summer diarrhoea. The best remedy is ipecac- 
uanha tabloids in large doses, or, if this is not to be obtained, opium. People 
who reside in tropical climates where dysentery is prevalent would do well 
to provide themselves with a good medicine chest fitted with medicines 
selected by a physician. 

DIZZINESS. — The treatment for this trouble depends on its cause, but 
usually the administration of a laxative, cooling the head and warming the feet, 
and a heart stimulant, will cause the condition to pass away without damage. 

EARACHE. — This very annoying and extremely painful disease can 
often be relieved by applying croton oil liniment to the back of the ear, and 
dropping into the ear five drops of sweet oil and two of laudanum. If ear- 
ache does not respond to this treatment it is probable that it is the result of 
some other trouble, and the doctor should be consulted. 

EPILEPSY. — The causes of this strange disease are but imperfectly 
understood, and no infallible remedy has yet been discovered. Total absti- 
nence from rich and animal food, with hygienic modes of living, constitute the 
best defense of an epileptic patient. When adults are laboring under the 
paroxysm little in general can be or ought to be done, except bringing the 
patient into fresh air, taking off what may be around the neck, and baring the 
chest, together with the more imperative duty of preventing the patient from 
doing himself any injury. If the paroxysm be prolonged, the application of 
cold to the head may be of some service. The inhalation of ammonia or 
chloroform has been found useful. 

FAINTING. — Fainting spells or fits are usually an affection of no con- 
sequence, but sometimes it is an index of a diseased heart. Generally, a recov- 
ery from a swoon is rapid if the patient is laid flat upon the ground, without 



166 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 

any pillow, the clothing loosened from the neck. A little cold water sprinkled 
into the face and the application of volatile substances to the nostrils are all 
that will be required during the fit. If recovery is delayed a turpentine injec- 
tion, or one containing a little whiskey and water should be administered, and 
the electro-magnetic current may be transmitted through the walls of the chest 
to stimulate the failing powers of the lungs and heart. 

FEVER— SCARLET.— See "Department of Children." 

FEVER — TYPHOID. — This disease under modern treatment does not 
claim as high a percentage of deaths as it did a few years back. It is probable 
that no city can entirely eradicate it. Like consumption germs, the germ of 
this disease is about us and in us all the time, and gains headway whenever 
our system becomes weakened. Typhoid can be transmitted from one person 
to another by contact or direct exposure to the stools or clothing of the invalid, 
but seldom is carried through the air. The causes of this disease are bad sew- 
age, water and milk, ices and salads, and certain vegetables, particularly celery. 
Typhoid is a disease of the stomach and bowels, of an ulcerous nature, and is 
seldom fatal in itself. It and the necessary treatment are very weakening, and 
complete prostration sometimes occurs. The early progress of the disease is 
gradual. The sufferer feels faint and weak, tired and listless, loses appetite and 
suffers from headache and restlessness. The fever gains headway steadily, and 
the ulcers form on the intestines, causing rose-colored spots to appear on the 
abdomen in about a week, from the irritation on the walls covering the diseased 
parts. Diarrhoea is a usual accompaniment, and the fever is worse at night. 
The moment this disease is suspected a diagnosis should be made by a physi- 
cian, so that the treatment may be started early. 

FITS. — See "Apoplexy," "Epilepsy," "Convulsions" and "Fainting." 

FLAT FOOT. — A flat foot is often the starting point of corns, bunions, 
pains in the legs, varicose veins, and all kinds of complaints. It begins usually 
from standing too many hours at a time, especially when a weight of any 
kind is carried. This accounts for the frequency with which it is found in 
nurse-maids and errand boys, and even waiters, especially when they are debili- 
tated from other causes or are not of a robust constitution. When the arch of 
the foot is completely broken down, as is sometimes the case, it is almost 
impossible to do much good if the patient, from the nature of his occupation-, 
is compelled to carry heavy weights. The first requisite is rest, and the sec- 
ond some mechanical means of supporting the foot. A pad of cork should be 
introduced into the sole of the shoe, and should be increased in size as the 
restoration of the natural shape of the foot progresses. Concurrently with this 
the general state of health must be improved by the administration of iron, 
extract of malt, hypophosphites and other tonics. Although walking exercise 
is not admissible, the sufferer should spend as much as possible of his time 
in the open air, preferably by the seaside. In the case of children we often find 
weak ankles associated with flat foot, and the best remedy for this is the use 
of well-made shoes. One of the greatest difficulties that parents have to con- 
tend with in these cases is that the majority of shoe-makers will not make 
shoes to fit the feet, but prefer pressing the toes together until the feet have 
to fit the shoes. This is the cause of much of the discomfort about the feet 
from which children commonly suffer. It is impossible to walk or run with 
comfort unless the shoes fit well. 

FROST-BITE. — Frost-bite is by no means common, and even in the 
coldest climates, people soon learn to take precautions, and by means of furs 



DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 167 

and appropriate clothing generally manage to defy the most severe cold. Chil- 
blains are in reality of much more common occurrence. The portion of the 
body most likely to suffer from the effects of exposure to a low temperature 
are the tips of the fingers, the tip of the nose, and the lobe of the ears. It 
is not uncommon for the nose to get frost-bitten without the person who is 
attacked knowing anything about it unless his attention is called to the 
circumstance by a companion. The explanation is that the cold dulls the 
sensation before attacking the deeper tissues. The directions usually given 
are to take a handful of snow and to rub the frost-bite vigorously until circu- 
lation is restored. It would never do to apply anything warm or to take 
the sufferer into a warm room. Very often people, without being actually 
frost-bitten, get numb and stupid from the effects of intense cold, and if 
allowed to have their own way they rapidly drift into a condition of uncon- 
sciousness from which it is impossible to rouse them. It is well known to 
all Arctic travellers that alcohol lowers the temperature of the body and is 
the very worst thing to take. 

GOUT. — Gout is a painful disease, affecting principally the fibrous 
tissues about the smaller joints and intimately connected with an excess of 
uric acid and its compounds in the blood. The symptoms of gout are: 
uneasiness, indigestion, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, biliary derange- 
ment, dull pains or numbness in parts affected, often with feverish symptoms; 
but in some cases, on the contrary, the disease comes on in the midst of 
apparent health and well-being. It sometimes comes on at night while 
asleep. All this is accompanied later by urinary sediment, extreme tender- 
ness, restlessness, involuntary muscular contractions, sleeplessness and 
perspiration. The affected joint is swollen, red and hot. When gout becomes 
chronic the attacks are more irregular, less severe, but more frequent and 
sudden, leaving one joint for another. Toward the end of the spell chalk-like 
deposits are thrown out above the joint in some, but not in all cases. High 
living, with indolent habits, generates gout. Even excess of animal food, 
with scanty exercise, has been known to produce it. Strong wines and malt 
liquors increase the tendency; weak wines do not seem to have the same 
effect. The small joints are more apt to be affectd in gout. The heart is 
seldom attacked and the stomach is spasmodically affected with symptoms. 
In gout, uric acid is in excess in the blood. Almost every drastic purgative, 
diuretic, tonic and narcotic has been pressed into service, either for external 
or internal use. During the attack colchicum and the alkalies are the 
remedies. Wine of the root of colchicum may be given in ten-or-twenty-drop 
doses several times daily. Stop the treatment when relief is obtained. Car- 
bonate of potassium, ten to thirty grains at once, with half drachm doses 
of rochelle salts will be important in addition. Mustard plasters to the ches* 
and back will be important, and the feet may be placed in hot mustard water. 
Regulation of the diet is of primary importance, but it should not be too low. 
Nourishment must be full while the digestive power is economizing, and 
positive stimulation avoided. Avoiding exposure to dampness, cold, and 
fatigue of body and mind are absolutely necessary as aids in the treatment 
of this disease. Change of air, traveling, and mineral waters are generally 
useful during the intervals between the paroxysms. Alkaline springs and 
baths have an especial reputation as prophylactics against gout. 

GUMBOIL. — This is sometimes followed by ulceration, which may 
be hard to heal unless the whole cause of the difficulty is removed, which can 
now be accomplished under nitrous oxide gas so quickly, painlessly and safely, 



168 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 

that no time should be lost in resorting to it. One extremely skillful operator 
in Philadelphia has now administered the gas for operations on the teeth in 
many thousand cases without a single fatal result. 

HEADACHE. — A pain in the head may be produced by a great number 
of causes. It may be neuralgic in character or it may result from dyspepsia, 
and inactive condition of the liver, or constipation. It may be situated at the 
back of the eyes, at the top of the head, over the eyes or at the back of the 
head. The pain may be of a dull, aching character, it may be throbbing or 
it may be acute, just as though a nail were being driven through the skull. 
Sometimes it is limited to one side, but this is not a common form. It may 
be attended with other symptoms, such as giddiness, nausea and retching. 
There may an inability to face the light, and little dark spots may 
be seen floating in front of the eyes. Stooping makes it worse, and not 
uncommonly it is relieved by lying down in a darkened room. It may be 
almost constant or continuous, or it may come on in distinct paroxysms. In 
the form which is known as sick headache, the stomach is so irritable that 
no food is retained for days. Even when the acute attack passes away the 
patient is left in a condition of prostration from which he recovers with 
extreme slowness. Headache of all kinds is most likely to occur in the case 
of those who lead a sedentary life, such as bank clerks, governesses and 
seamstresses. To people unaccustomed to an active life a long railway jour- 
ney often acts as the exciting cause, while others suffer from it from sitting 
in a hot, stuffy room, or after a visit to a theatre or other place of amusement. 
Errors of diet may be regarded as another exciting cause, although they are 
probably less potent than defective ventilation. Minute work, such as sewing, 
etching, and even piano playing, will often bring on an attack; in fact, anything 
which tries the eyes seems to be prejudicial. It may be that in many of these 
cases the eyes themselves require attention, and that relief would be obtained 
by wearing suitable glasses, selected under the care of an ophthalmic surgeon. 
Finally, it is an undoubted fact that headache of all kinds is not infrequently 
associated with decayed teeth. With regard to treatment, there are various 
plans which deserve consideration; thus, when the pain is of a throbbing or 
congestive character, relief is often experienced by plunging the head into a 
basin of cold water. Other people find that the best way of cutting short 
an attack is the application over the painful spot of a stick or cone of menthol, 
or even a few drops of oil of peppermint. A strong cup of coffee often proves 
successful. In all cases of headache, it is essential that the bowels should be 
kept thoroughly opened. This is best accomplished by taking a dose of aperient 
mineral water in the morning before breakfast. 

HEARTBURN. — Heartburn is a form of indigestion, and is due to 
acidity. An irregular form of fermentation takes place in the stomach, result- 
ing in the formation of acids. The symptoms of which the patient complains 
are, in addition to a burning pain in the stomach, flatulence, nausea, the 
regurgitation of food into the mouth, headache and constipation. For im- 
mediate relief there is nothing better than the occasional use of a soda-mint 
tabloid, whilst to obtain permanent relief it is desirable that the patient should 
take pepsin with his meals, or should have his food predigested by means of 
Zymine powders. Another good remedy for heartburn, and one which rarely 
three times a day immediately after meals. In the same way a good deal of 
fails to give satisfaction, is a teaspoonful of glycerine in a wine glass of water 
benefit is often derived from taking the same dose of glycerine of borax in 
water; in fact, any substance possessing mild antiseptic properties is effica-

cious. At the same time that these remedies are resorted to, attention must 
be paid to diet, and it is essential that sweet substances of all kinds should be 
avoided. 

HEAT STROKE.— See "Sunstroke." 

HICCOUGH. — Hiccough is due to spasmodic contraction of the dia- 
phragm, and is usually the result of flatulence or indigestion. It is not un- 
commonly obstinate, and in hysterical girls may persist for days, to the great 
inconvenience, not only of the sufferer, but of her friends. A good remedy 
is a soda-mint tabloid every ten minutes; but not uncommonly tincture of 
capsicum proves still more efficacious. Amongst other useful remedies may 
be mentioned bromide of potassium, bromide of sodium, and strong tincture 
of ginger. When the symptoms are urgent, more benefit is sometimes ob- 
tained from remedies which are inhaled than from those which are taken by 
the stomach. Amongst the best remedies to employ in this way are eucalyptus 
and pure terebene; the vapor which is given off is taken by a long, deep 
breath into the lungs. Sometimes the relief afforded by this simple mode of 
procedure is immediate and the hiccough at once ceases. To prevent a recur- 
rence of the condition the patient should be given a good purge. With 
respect to diet, it is always a good plan to avoid tea, and to take as little in 
the way of green vegetables as possible. As a substitute for ordinary bread, 
use brown bread, wholemeal bread, toast, or dry biscuits. Some people use 
charcoal biscuits, but they are unpleasant to take. 

HYSTERIA. — From its occurrence nearly always in females and from 
a supposition of its originating in some affection of the womb, this name has 
been given to a variable disorder of which the main characteristic is morbid 
excitability of the whole nervous system. Retention of urine, cough, aphonia, 
and so forth, are often produced by this. Simulation of other diseases, indeed, 
the assumption of severe functional disorders of different organs, is a common 
trait of hysteria. Catalepsy or trance is a condition allied to hysteria in some 
respects, in which the whole frame lies prostrate and helpless, or that a limb, 
if lifted up, falls back as if it were relaxed and dead, while the consciousness 
of the person affected may be retained without the sensitiveness to physical 
pain. This curious state of existence is not well understood, and in our 
present ignorance of its nature the chief importance lies in its being distin- 
guished from death early enough to prevent that most horrible of all misfor- 
tunes, being buried alive. A tonic regimen is usually demanded for hysteria, 
such as iron and cod-liver oil. Bromide of potassium is sometimes quite 
useful. For a paroxysm of "hysterics" asafetida is safe and proper. Exercise 
in open air is also very important. Avoid all excitements. Cold bathing, 
especially the shower baths or sea bathing, when followed by reaction, will 
do good. 

INDIGESTION. — Indigestion is one of the most distressing complaints 
from which it falls to the lot of man to suffer. It occurs both in men and 
women, and amongst all classes of society. When once established, it is 
eradicated with the utmost difficulty, and may persist for years. The symp- 
toms from which the patient usually suffers are pain in the chest after meals, 
marked depression of spirits, an inaptitude for exertion, flatulence, headache 
and constipation. The pain in the chest may come on immediately after the 
meal, or not until some time after. Sometimes, in addition to these symptoms 
there is a constant regurgitation of fluid into the mouth, usually of an intensely 
acid character. Spitting of blood is not a symptom of this complaint, and 
should it occur it may be taken as an indication that ulceration of the stomach 



DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 171 

exists as a complication. With regard to treatment, have all foods "pepton- 
ized." This is a very simple process, which, after a little practice, can be 
performed without the slightest difficulty. Take the case of milk, for exam- 
ple: all that is necessary is to dilute it with one quarter of water, add pepton- 
izing tablet, and allow it to stand in a warm place for about fifteen minutes, 
when it is ready for use. A very slight modification of this plan suffices for 
other articles of diet, so that without much difficulty everything may be taken 
peptonized. An excellent combination for dyspeptic subjects is a half-tumbler- 
ful of peptonized milk with a teaspoonful of beef juice. If the prominent 
symptom of the complaint is acidity, there is nothing better than a soda-mint 
or bi-carbonate of soda tabloid, taken from time to time. This treatment, 
although beneficial, will not always effect a cure. When constipation is a 
prominent factor, a dose of aperient mineral water the first thing in the 
morning will be found more useful than anything. It must be remembered, 
that in order to digest food it must be masticated, and mixed with a due pro- 
portion of saliva. For the efficient performance of this act there must be 
teeth, and teeth, not only in one, but in both jaws. It is not a pleasing thing 
to have to wear false teeth, but it is better to have false teeth than no teeth 
at all. They are by no means difficult to keep in order, and if they are light, 
and fit well, they are not inconvenient to wear. 

INFLUENZA. — Influenza, or La Grippe, is a very contagious disease, 
appearing at odd intervals without apparent cause, usually in cold weather. 
It starts very quickly, and is in full force in about four days. In the early 
stages it is often taken for a cold, the patient sneezing, having headache, pains 
all over the body and eyes watering. There is sometimes a very weakening 
cough, and in some cases complete mental and physical prostration that is 
very stubborn. This is probably the most typical symptom. In some cases 
the stomach is affected, and loss of appetite and vomiting are prominent. If 
possible, the patient should be isolated and disinfectants used. More progress 
will be made if the patient remains in bed. Warm baths will reduce the 
aching. Keep the bowels open, give fever-reducing medicine, use plenty of 
liquids and force the feeding. Recovery usually takes several days, but if the 
treatment brings no response, see a doctor, as complications often follow. 

ITCH. — The itch is a parasitic skin disease, due to the presence of the 
itchmite. At one time it was extremely common, but is now comparatively 
rare. It attacks the hands and feet chiefly, and rarely or never the face. It 
gives rise to a good deal of discomfort and irritation, and keeps the sufferer 
awake at night. It is distinctly contagious, and is readily conveyed from one 
person to anotherd by the simple process of shaking hands. The itching which 
it gives rise to is beneficial, for it serves to impress very emphatically on the 
patient the necessity for adopting curative measures. The complaint is by no 
means difficult of recognition, for the intense itching between the fingers and 
toes is sufficiently characteristic, and admits of no doubt as to its nature. It 
is apt to be obstinate; but simple cases are readily cured by the application of 
an ointment composed of equal parts of sulphur and lanoline or lard. Should 
this fail to produce the desired effect in a couple of days, the patient should 
take a sulphur bath. If these measures taken conjointly should fail to effect 
a cure, a systematic course of treatment is called for, and the patient should, 
without delay, obtain medical treatment. This is necessary, because it is not 
improbable that it will spread through the entire family. An attack of the 
itch may be followed by eczema, and this is sometimes more obstinate and 
difficult to cure than the original disease itself. It is a mistake to use very 



172 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 

strong applications, and when inflammation has set in, soothing dusting- 
powders, oxide of zinc, etc., will be found beneficial. 

JAUNDICE. — This disease may be regarded as an indication of the 
existence of some disturbance of the liver. It is a condition which is by no 
means difficult of recogniticn, for not only are the skin and the whites of 
the eye yellow, but the urine is high-colored, and the motions are practically 
white. The patient suffers frcm intense depression of spirits, and is sick 
after any attempt at taking solid food. The condition is the result of obstruc- 
tion of the bile duct, the immediate exciting cause being exposure to cold or 
some similar cause. People who have suffered from it once are very liable 
to future attacks. It is not a dangerous complaint, but it may last three 
weeks or a month, and during that time the patient will have to keep his room, 
if not actually to bed. Should the complaint not take its departure in that 
time it is to be feared that it is associated with some more serious organic 
disease, such as cancer. The ordinary cases of jaundice are best treated by 
absolute rest, a diet consisting of milk and soda water, and the administration 
from time to time of large doses of some saline aperient. Jaundice, however, 
is so likely to be attended with complications of a serious nature that the 
attendance of a doctor is absolutely necessary. Should the patient, in the 
course of his illness, be seized with an attack of acute pain in the stomach, 
he is probably passing a gall-stone. He should be given a tumblerful of hot 
water, in which a dose of essence of peppermint has been dissolved, and a 
large linseed-meal poultice should be applied to the abdomen. Retching is 
not an uncommon symptom, and may cause the patient intense distress. It 
may be necessary to give morphia, and the doctor in attendance on the case 
should be sent for without a moment's delay. 

LIVER COMPLAINT.— This disease is hard to diagnose, and is most 
often caused by alcoholism. The presence of indigestion, jaundice and dropsy, 
with coated tongue and bitter taste in the mouth, and acrid eruptions are 
indications. The proper secretions of the liver are stopped, and the bile taken 
up by the blood. Biliousness, constipation and pain in the right side follow. 
The first thing to be done is to purge the bowels thoroughly, eat regularly, and 
drink aperient waters. This treatment should be kept up for several days, and 
if not successful a physician should be called on to prescribe a remedy that 
will cause the liver to become active again. Inactivity of the liver deprives 
the patient of ambition and mentality, and causes a moroseness that is danger- 
ous, and complications may follow if a diseased liver is neglected. 

LUMBAGO. — Lumbago is a form of muscular rheumatism, which at- 
tacks the muscles of the back. It has only one symptom, and that is pain. 
It is often the result to exposure to cold, but may be produced by severe 
or unaccustomed exercise, such as the first day's shooting or riding. It is 
more likely to attack middle-aged men and women than young people. The 
patient, as a rule, has no difficulty in stooping down, but finds it almost 
impossible to straighten himself again. With regard to treatment, liniments 
are useful, those usually employed being the liniments of aconite, belladonna, 
and chloroform, either alone or mixed. Of local applications one of the best 
is a menthol plaster, a piece measuring six inches by four being applied firmly 
over the regions of the loins. It sometimes produces a good deal of tingling 
and smarting, but it does good. Turpentine is another good application, and 
is sprinkled on a fold of flannel wrung out of hot water and applied to the 
painful part. A full length hot bath, containing a little eucalyptia or pure 
terebene, often affords almost instantaneous relief. Of internal remedies the 



DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 173 

best is iodide of potassium, but when the patient is gouty greater reliance may 
be placed on tabloids of guaiacum and sulphur. When, on the contrary, there 
is rheumatic tendency, salicylate of sodium does more good. Many obstinate 
cases of lumbago are undoubtedly kept up by constipation, and a compound 
cathartic tabloid at bedtime is often followed by prompt relief. 

MUMPS.— See "Department of Children." 

NAUSEA. — This trouble and its treatment are discussed in the "Depart- 
ment of Children," and the same is true in adult cases with allowance made 
for difference in age, size and strength. 

NERVOUSNESS. — Nervousness can hardly be regarded as a disease, 
but undoubtedly it is the cause of much discomfort and unhappiness to many 
young people. It is a condition almost impossible to define, but everyone 
knows what is meant by the term. As people grow older they grow out of it. 
One of the best means of curing nervousness is to lead an active life and to 
go as much as possible into society. Young girls are much less nervous than 
they were formerly, simply because they go in largely for athletics and life as 
rationally as their brothers do. The young and delicate lady of thirty years 
ago is now rarely met with, except in remote country districts. When a 
young man is subject to fits of nervousness, the best thing he can do is to join 
a club of some kind, where he will be brought in contact with other men of 
his own age and position in society. The worst of nervousness is that it 
is apt, as the patient grows older, to degenerate into hypochondriasis. In this 
condition the victim imagines himself to be a prey to all kinds of diseases, and 
spends much unnecessary time in consulting doctors and taking medicines. 

NEURALGIA. — The pain may occur in any part of the body; but the 
commonest variety is that which attacks the face. Neuralgia is met with 
most commonly in the weak and debilitated. It is often associated with, and 
possibly dependent on, anaemia; but often the pain is due to irritation of de- 
cayed teeth or of their stumps. The pain of neuralgia is usually very acute, 
and may keep the sufferer awake night after night. When attacks of neuralgia 
about the head are of prolonged duration, and of frequent recurrence, the hair 
comes off in patches or loses its original color. It is not uncommon for the 
patient, as the result of persistent pain, to look worn and worried, and very 
often there is a considerable loss of flesh. The treatment of neuralgia is a 
subject which requires a great deal of careful consideration. Much may be 
done by hygienic means and the administration of medicine. An abundance 
of fresh air, systematic physical exercise, plenty of sleep, a good supply of 
wholesome nourishment, and the absence of monotony as regards occupation, 
are essential factors in the treatment of this disease. Many patients who are 
neuralgic have a deep-rooted objection to taking fat, and they should be given 
either cod-liver oil, or, what is better, malt extract with cod-liver oil, three 
times a day for many months in succession. When the neuralgia depends 
on the presence of an old attack of ague, a five-grain tabloid of bisulphate 
of quinine should be taken three times a day. Even when the neuralgia 
does not depend on the ague this mode of treatment may prove successful. 
When the disease is associated with anaemia, iron is the appropriate remedy. 
When other remedies have failed, chloride of ammonium may be resorted 
to with a fair expectation of success. Electricity sometimes does good; but 
it is likely to succeed only when applied by a physician having a good anatom- 
ical knowledge of the structures involved. 

OBESITY. — This condition is met with most frequently among those 
of a phlegmatic or lymphatic temperament, and is not common in those of an 



174 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 

active and energetic frame of mind. Corpulence is undoubtedly, in many 
cases, the result of excessive indulgence in animal food, and those who are 
addicted to the pleasures of the table have to recognize the fact that they are 
not unattended with certain unpleasant consequences. Amongst people who 
increase rapidly in size may be mentioned those who are addicted to the use 
of alcoholic beverages in large quantities, and it is a common remark that 
beer produces fat much more rapidly than wine or spirits. It is difficult to 
distinguish the point at which obesity ceases to be a natural condition, and is 
to be regarded as a disease. 

A table of what the patient may eat and what he must avoid is drawn 
up, and to this he has strictly to adhere. The basis of these tables and sys- 
tems is pretty much the same, the patient being required to limit the amount 
of fluid taken, and to abstain, as far as possible, from all articles containing 
sugar, starch and fats. 

There is often a rapid reduction in weight, but not uncommonly this is 
obtained at the cost of strength. A system of dietetics of this description is 
not applicable to every case, and it would be a great mistake to follow it im- 
plicitly, unless under medical advice. From time to time various special 
remedies have been vaunted for the cure of obesity without restrictions of 
diet. One of the most nutritious of these, on being analyzed, was found to 
consist of nothing more than common seaweed. Saccharine does not come 
within this category, and is not used to cure corpulence, but simply as a sub- 
stitute for sugar. Saccharine is now extensively used, and many people with 
a tendency to obesity or diabetes find it a good plan to carry in the pocket a 
vial of saccharine tabloids, so that they are immediately available for use in 
tea, coffee or any other beverage that may require sweetening. 

A remedy which is said to be extremely efficacious in the treatment of 
obesity is "Hashra tea," a combination of various roots, leaves and other vege- 
tables possessing tonic and other laxative properties. In cases of obesity asso- 
ciated with a gout, tinct. guaiacum and sulphur will be found useful, and in 
all cases a dose of aperient mineral water, taken the first thing in the morn- 
ing, before breakfast, cannot fail to exert a beneficial effect. With regard to 
climate, people with a tendency to become fat usually find that their health is 
better in a dry, high, bracing district than in one in which the air is humid. 

PILES. — Hemorrhoids or piles are exceedingly common and trouble- 
some complaints, consisting of little tumors, which form at the edge or just 
inside the rectum, and give rise to intense suffering, especially when the bowels 
are evacuated. There are three varieties — external, internal and mixed. Their 
production is favored by constipation, sedentary habits, hard seats and some 
forms of liver complaint. The inflammatory enlargement is tender and in- 
flamed. The external variety do not bleed. Very often their surface, which 
in the internal variety is composed of the distended mucous membrane, exudes 
blood, in which case they are called bleeding piles. When seated outside the 
margin of the rectum they are not so apt to bleed, and receive the name of 
blind piles. They may generally be prevented from developing by proper 
attention to the bowels, non-stimulating diet and rest, and, whilst small, an 
ointment of ten grains of extract of belladonna, thirty grains of tannin, and 
twenty grains of powdered opium in an ounce of simple ointment, will usually 
relieve them. 

PLEURISY. — In ordinary cases the treatment is simple. The patient 
should be put to bed in a warm room. Apply flannels wrung out of hot water 
or mustard plasters over the seat of pain in the side. If necessary, to remove 



DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 175 

the pain, a few drops of laudanum may be sprinkled on the plaster before 
applying. Give plenty of hot composition tea, or tea made from pleurisy root; 
apply hot bricks to the extremities, and get up a good perspiration. A good 
dose of salts is generally needed and should be given, say a tablespoonful. If 
there seems to be much effusion of water into the pleural cavity, give cathartic 
pills. 

PNEUMONIA. — This is the medical name for inflammation of the lungs. 
It attacks young men and women often when apparently in the midst of ro- 
bust health. The onset is usually quite sudden, the first indication of anything 
wrong being the occurrence of a shivering fit. This may come on without any 
assignable cause, or may be traceable to some particular exposure to cold or 
wet. It, in many cases, has resulted from sleeping in wet sheets, while it may 
be due to sitting on damp grass or getting wet through. The initial attack of 
shivering is followed by a high fever, and by high temperature, quick pulse, hot 
skin and flushed face. Very soon there is a pain in the side, which is greatly 
intensified by drawing a deep breath, or even by moving. After a while the 
cough develops, and, when it is accompanied by thick expectoration, there is 
no longer any room for doubt as to the nature of the illness. The prostration 
is usually very great, so that the patient is quite unable to take any steps for 
his own protection and is entirely dependent on others. The bowels, as a rule, 
are confined, but there may be diarrhoea. An acute attack of pneumonia may 
be secondary to some other disease, such as typhoid fever. Pneumonia is not 
a complaint which admits of being dealt with by domestic remedies, and the 
sooner the services of a skilled physician are secured the better for the welfare 
of the patient. 

QUINSY. — This is a very painful local disease of the throat, attacking 
young and middle-aged persons. Exposure to cold or wet will cause it. The 
patient usually suffers from fever, loss of strength, earache and a swelling of 
the throat that causes difficulty in breathing and swallowing. This swelling 
sometimes suppurates and breaks, and sometimes disappears in a few days. 
The best that can be done is to prevent swelling and suppuration. Spray the 
throat with peroxide of hydrogen and keep hot poultices constantly on the 
throat and under the chin and ears. By this means the disease can generally 
be cut short, but if it progresses to suppuration the attendance of a physician 
is required. Poultices made from hops are generally as good as anything. 
The application of fat pork, sprinkled with pepper, has also been recommended, 
but the poultice always gives the best results. The bowels must be kept open, 
and for this purpose Epsom salts are generally used. 

RASHES. — The appearance of a "rash" on the skin, as distinguished 
from an eruption, may be taken as an indication that the patient is suffering 
from one of the specific fevers, such as measles or small-pox, and a doctor 
should be seen at once to diagnose the trouble. It takes a good deal of ex- 
perience to distinguish one rash from another with absolute certainty. Some- 
times it is quite easy and presents no difficulty; but at others it is almost im- 
possible to give a definite opinion. Those who have had most experience in 
these matters are the first to recognize the difficulties which present them- 
selves. There are several points to note about a rash. Amongst the most im- 
portant are the day of the illness on which it first appeared, the situation or 
part of the body on which it was first seen, the color, the shape of the spots 
or patches, the variations they undergo, and, lastly, the duration. The gen- 
eral symptoms from which the patient suffers will often form a better guide 
to the nature of the illness than the rash itself.

RINGWORM. — Ringworm is a disease of the hair and of the hair fol- 
licles, which derives its name from the fact that it spreads in the form of a 
ring. It is not due to the presence of a worm, however, but of a vegetable 
fungus known as the Trichophyton. This fungus is simply a plant, which 
grows and propagates much as other plants do. It flourishes best on the heads 
of children of delicate constitution, and thrives badly when the scalp is healthy 
and well nourished. It is sometimes communicated from children to adults; 
but when the soil is incongenial it rarely makes much progress, and is soon 
eradicated. The mere fact of the existence of ringworm in an individual may 
be regarded as conclusive proof that the general state of the health is not what 
it should be. Ringworm of the scalp is recognized by loss of hair in circular 
patches, which soon become scaly. After a time the disease spreads all over 
the head, and may even attack the body. The worst feature about it is its 
contagiousness, and if it breaks out in a school it is by no means an easy thing 
to contend with, so that either isolation of the pupils has to be resorted to or 
the school has to be closed. Schoolmasters are often strangely ignorant of the 
very elements of the science of hygiene, so that if they sustain pecuniary loss 
they have, as a rule, only themselves to blame. One of the commonest faults 
is the neglect of the simple precaution of seeing that towels and brushes and 
combs do not become common property. One of the most useful applications 
in cases of ringworm is lanoline ointment, which should be rubbed into the 
head night and morning. It is a good plan to paint the patches from time to 
time with tincture of iodine. An old remedy used in the country, which con- 
sists of powdered sulphur mixed with lard to the consistency of an ointment, 
often effects a cure when iodine fails. It must be remembered, however, that 
no local application will effect a cure unless the condition of the general health 
is improved. The child should be placed without delay on a course of extract 
of malt and cod liver oil, and this should be kept up without intermission for 
weeks at a time. The occasional administration of iron will also exert a bene- 
ficial effect. 

SEA-SICKNESS. — Some people are peculiarly susceptible to sea-sick- 
ness and suffer from it on the slightest provocation. As a rule, women suffer 
more than men. The symptoms, as everyone knows, are extremely distress- 
ing. Although it may persist for many days it is not as a rule dangerous, and 
the majority of travelers soon get over their unpleasant experience. All kinds 
of remedies have been tried from time to time, and a reliable remedy is bro- 
mide of potassium — fifteen grains should be taken at a dose, preferable before 
going on board. It should be dissolved in water, and the solution sweetened 
to taste. If there is any objection to the use of bromide of potassium, bromide 
of sodium may be substituted. Many people place more reliance on a glass or 
two of good dry cb Nnpagne than on medicine proper, and thousands depend 
on sucking lemon?

TOOTHACHE. — A most painful affection caused by cold or decay of 
teeth affecting the nerve which supplies the same. Almost immediate relief 
can be obtained by making pressure upon the root of the nerve just below the 
temple, opposite the centre of the ear. Quick relief is also obtained by placing 
a drop or two of oil of cloves upon a small piece of cotton and introducing it 
into the cavity of the affected tooth. The parts should be kept warm either 
by application or a poultice with a little laudanum, or by means of a water-bag. 



DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 177 

TUMORS. — Tumors are of various kinds and descriptions, and occur in 
all parts of the body. It is just as well to understand at the outset that the 
word "tumor," if unqualified, conveys no meaning, and certainly no informa- 
tion as to the severity of the disease. For example, a little mass of fat not 
bigger than a nut is a tumor, but no one supposes that it is likely to increase 
in size or do any harm. On the other hand, there are malignant tumors and 
ovarian tumors, which involve a serious operation and speedily cause death if 
not removed. Even tumors of the same part are not always of the same kind. 
For example, there are simple tumors of the breast and there are tumors which 
are of the nature of cancer, and they are very different in their course and 
danger to health. Tumors of the breast have always been the happy hunting 
ground of unscrupulous quacks, who prey on the fears of unhappy women. 
They take advantage of the fact that many so-called tumors are innocent in 
character and display a tendency to get well by themselves. By positively 
asserting that every case is a cancer they get a sufficient number of so-called 
"cures" to act as advertisements and bring other people. There is only one 
course open to a person who is supposed to have a tumor, and that is to go 
without delay to a good surgeon. 

VARICOSE VEINS. — Varicose or enlarged veins are common in mid- 
dle-aged people, and are practically confined to the legs. In women they are 
the result of frequent pregnancies or of much standing. It is a recognized fact 
that women are capable of much less "standing about" than are men. It would 
be almost impossible for a woman to do the work of a car conductor, simply 
because she could not keep on her feet for the requisite number of hours. There 
is no difficulty in recognizing the existence of varicose veins, for they stand 
out as deep-blue congested lines, showing the course of the blood-vessels. 
They are not only unsightly, but they give rise to a pain and a feeling of weight 
and discomfort which is hard to bear. If relief is not afforded they go on 
getting bigger and bigger until the skin over them gets thin and attenuated. 
The parts are badly nourished, and ultimately an ulcer forms, which is difficult 
to heal. There is another danger, and that is from the accidental rupture of 
one of these big veins. If it breaks the loss of blood is profuse, and the patient 
may die from the hemorrhage. A great deal may be done in the way of treat- 
ment, especially in the early stages. The bowels should be carefully regulated, 
so as to avoid the risks of constipation. An elastic stocking should be worn. 
The patient should sit down when possible, to avoid the strain of standing 
about, and should take a teaspoonful of hazeline in a wine glass of water three 
times a day. By the adoption of these measures a cure may be effected, but 
progress will be slow, and will probably take weeks or even months before any 
great improvement is noticed. Should these steps fail, a surgical operation 
will have to be resorted to, in order to get rid of the difficulty. It is not a 
serious operation, but at the same time it is not unattended with risks, and it 
will have to be performed by a good surgeon. It means confinement to bed for 
some days at least, but it is worth the trouble and inconvenience for the sake 
of the relief which is afforded. 

WARTS. — Take a little nitric acid in a glass-stoppered bottle and add 
one-half as much water, making the acid two-thirds normal strength. Apply by 
means of a little piece of wood, such as a match stick, taking care to have the 
stick merely wet and not with a drop adhering. Hold it on the top of wart un- 
til there is a slight burning sensation. Do not apply enough acid to cause 
active burning. Repeat this process daily, and patiently. In the course of a 
week or more the wart will be gone. Be careful not to let the acid touch any 



178 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 

healthy surface, and do not try to do the work all at once. Avoid making a 
sore, even if it takes two or three weeks to destroy the wart.

EXERCISES. 

Exercising the muscles is absolutely essential to life, and the more 
carefully it is done the better effect it will have. By carefully studying the 
subject such exercise may be taken as will bring about nearly any desired 
effect upon the system, especially if done in conjunction with proper dieting 
and perhaps some medical aid to overcome an existing condition. Exercise, 
by the contraction and expansion of the muscles, forces the blood to the sur- 
face and also back to the heart, thus aiding that organ. At the same time 
it stimulates breathing and purifies the blood that is rapidly being forced 
through the lungs. This in turn stimulates the entire body and all the organs, 
and you are improving in health. Appetite is increased, and the newly-vital- 
ized organs are better fitted to digest your food. A lack of exercise means just 
the opposite of all the above benefits, and must eventually lead to ruined 
health. 

FEMALE. — It is difficult and inadvisable to try to make any set rule of 
exercise for women, as such exercise as greatly benefits some will be attended 
by adverse results in others. While some women seem to be able to take any 
exercise common to men without doing themselves any harm, they should bear 
in mind that they are of a different build, and their physical destiny is vastly 
different. If a girl is hearty and well, and exercises freely when young, she 
may keep it up all her life without damage, but one who is not used to it 
should commence carefully, selecting such exercises as are most beneficial 
while least apt to be injurious, and using them moderately. Women should 
not stand about unnecessarily. Walking does not do as much harm as stand- 
ing. Avoid useless running up and down stairs. Take exercises without cor- 
sets, and strengthen the back so that you are not dependent upon any stay, 
although you may desire to wear them at times. Be sure that you have the 
purest air possible when exercising. Outdoor exercise is most beneficial, 
whether walking or playing games. If done for health particularly, keep the 
fact in mind and keep the shoulders back, stand erect, breathe deeply, exercise 
all muscles freely and do not overtax your strength. The exercise a woman 
gets while at work is not necessarily beneficial, for it seldom brings many of 
the muscles into play and the proper air is almost impossible. For those who 
cannot get out of doors at the proper times, a very simple method of exercising 
for fifteen minutes each day will bring astonishing results. Rise early in the 
morning and remove all clothing so that the air may have free access to the 
skin. See that the air is fresh and as cool as possible, opening the windows, 
unless very cold or stormy. Then go through such motions as will exercise 
all the muscles, not violently and quickly, but slowly, using your strength to 
keep the muscles rigid. Increase the speed gradually so that when you finish 
you will be warm, and breathing freely. Rub down quickly with a coarse towel 
before dressing. 

MALE. — As a class, men get better exercise at their work than women, 
but even a man who is working at physical labor may be compelled to take 
certain exercises in order to keep his development balanced and his health

proper. For men whose positions are sedentary and inactive, a great deal can 
be accomplished by following the same treatment as given for women. Man 
should have more strength and animal spirits than woman, and his exercising 
should be harder. Exercising until thoroughly tired will seldom harm a man 
unless he is suffering from a depressing disease. Where possible, men should 
take part in some sort of athletic sports, or at least persevere in frequent walks. 

INDOOR. — While outdoor exercise is more to be desired, there are 
many persons whose time is so taken up during the hours of the day that they 
cannot obtain it. There are times, too, when the state of health or the weather 
make it advisable to remain indoors. There are many excellent gymnasiums 
where perfect indoor exercise may be had, and those who do not care to be 
away from home or spend the money, may apply the same training in their 
own homes at little cost after they have learned it. Perseverance, persistence 
and regularity must be practiced to get the most good of it. In home exercis- 
ing be sure that the air is purified, for the activity causes the system to absorb 
rapidly, whether it be purity or poison. Frequent bathing and the absence 
of alcoholic beverages are great aids in procuring the greatest good from 
exercise. 

OUTDOOR. — This is the great, life-giving, health-creating, pleasure- 
making, correct method of exercise, and it is hard to imagine a case where a 
person could have too much of it. If nothing in the shape of games or sports 
are indulged in, walking with shoulders thrown back and head erect will bring 
into play almost every muscle of the body, especially if the walk is through 
the country where there are rough places, fences and up and down grades. 
All binding clothing should be left off, and persons should dress lightly, so that 
when they are exercising they will not be uncomfortable, or suffer from reac- 
tion. Running, jumping, skating, horse-back riding; in fact, all outdoor exer- 
cises are beneficial and should be encouraged, but if you find that a certain 
exercise aggravates some weakness, it must give way to some other form. 

FEMALE BEAUTY. 

FACE. — See "Complexion." 

FORM. — We have stated that it is the duty of woman to preserve her 
beauty of face, and it is much more important that she attain and retain a 
beautiful form. Not merely or primarily for the sake of appearances, but 
because nature intended her to have a beautiful form, and if she is in proper 
health it will be so. Therefore it is safe to say that unless a woman is physi- 
cally defective she is not in good health unless her form is good. The first 
requisite of a perfect form is good health, and this can only be obtained by dil- 
igent exercise, careful diet and constant care. 

The matter of dressing is also one of great importance, but we wish to 
emphasize the fact that NO WOMAN SHOULD MAKE HER FORM WITH 
HER CLOTHING, but should attain the best form possible and then clothe 
it to the best advantage. A woman may be a little stout or a little thin, and 
without reduction by pressure or adding artificially, may dress so that her 
form is very attractive if she studies the art. There is a terrible tendency 
among women to maltreat their forms, in an effort to become the abject slaves 
of a cruel, heartless and destructive mistress called "Fashion," who jumps 
from one extreme of torture to the other without any apparent reason than a 
desire to destroy the God-given beauty of the female form. Follow her, if you 
desire, so long as her dictates do not injure your health, and then rebel against 
injustice, as did our forefathers against an unjust monarch.

Does the Married Woman

You have heard the talk about married 
women neglecting their personal appear-

it is frequently taken for gospel truth. 

But it is seldom true. With a full ward-

Mrs. Newlywed may possibly content her- 
self with fewer new gowns. But if she is 
wise she can keep all her gowns shapely — 
simply by wearing the right corsets. 

With the figure molded comfortably into

FRECKLES. 

TO REMOVE. — Try the following: Bichloride of mercury two grammes, 
sulphate of zinc four grammes, spirits of camphor five grammes, distilled 
water one hundred and fifty grammes. Dilute with three parts of water and 
apply to the spots with a piece of soft linen at night. Label the bottle plainly 
with red ink, as bichloride of mercury is a poison and should be handled dis- 
creetly. It will not injure the face in the least when used as here directed. 

HAIR. 

CARE. — To preserve the hair the scalp should be kept thick and mova- 
ble. Massaging will help to do this as will also much brushing. Keep the 
scalp clean; it cannot be washed too often, as dirt and germs collect here more 
readily than in any other part of the body. Frequent shampooing with pure 
castile soap is very beneficial. If there is much dandruff, rub in the yolk of 
an egg very thoroughly before washing with the soap. Brush the hair fre- 
quently and until the scalp feels flushed and warm. Never use a comb with 
rough teeth, and never use a fine comb for cleaning, but wash or brush out the 
dandruff to be removed. Crimping and curling the hair certainly does great 
damage to it, and those who do this, do so at the price of premature loss or 
baldness. Women usually preserve the color of the hair longer than men, and 
light hair falls out sooner, but turns gray later than dark. Illness or anxiety 
are often the cause of gray hairs even early in life. The hair is naturally of 
an oily nature, and where sickness or other cause has deprived it of this, some 
such grease as vaseline or mixtures should be applied. Scalp diseases should 
be treated by a physician, and each person may by watchfulness and care pre- 
serve the quantity, color and appearance of the hair and do much toward 
keeping it in a healthy condition. 

REMOVING. — Pulling out surplus hair or hair on the face is very fool- 
ish as well as dangerous. It causes the hair to grow again more rapidly, and 
each succeeding growth will be coarser. It also roughens the skin, and leaves 
small open pores that may become infected with disease or matter that will 
poison the blood. There are numerous chemical preparations on the market 
for this purpose, few of which may be used without danger. Probably the 
safest method is by the use of the electric needle in the hands of an expert. 
This is a very painful operation, and expensive, too, and it should not be done 
except by some one with knowledge and experience. 

HEALTH. 

The greatest treasure given to the human being is health. This would 
probably be the verdict of nine out of every ten persons. It might seem that 
life or love could be considered greater, but neither may be properly enjoyed 
without health. There are few persons so badly treated by nature or heritage 
that they may not attain comparatively perfect health if they are willing to 
pay the price. There's the difficulty. We all want perfect health, but are not 
willing to pay the price. And yet the price may not be a penny of money, in 
fact, it may mean, and usually does, more money for us along with the health, 
and yet we are not willing to pay the price. The price of perfect health is 
eternal vigilance and sacrifice. We may be willing to pay away vast sums 
of money to doctors, but refuse to sacrifice the indulgence of an appetite or 
a habit. It is safe to say that two-thirds of the sickness of the human race 



DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 183 

could be prevented by those who are the sufferers, and half of the other third 
could be prevented by others than those who are ill. This is particularly 
noticeable in cases of alcoholism, where the appetite masters the will and 
sacrifices the health of the drinker and also the comfort and health of those 
dependent upon him and those who come in contact with him. Probably 
more health is sacrificed to the appetite for food than there is for drink. It 
does not become so apparent, and its growth is so gradual that it is too late 
to prevent it before you are aware of its presence. Probably less than one 
per cent, of the population of the world refrain from eating everything that 
they know is not good for them. In seme it does not ruin the health, but 
merely causes discomfort. Again thousands, especially women, knowingly 
sacrifice their health on the altar of fashion, and so down the line of human 
appetites, desires and habits, each one claims its victim who, knowingly or 
ignorantly, sacrifice their great birthright, gift of health. To some men, to- 
bacco is a serious poison, and they know it, but still refuse to give up the use 
of it. Others sacrifice their health to lack of sanitation or bodily cleanliness, 
others to sexual abuses, some to indolence, and still others to some other 
health-destroying evil that appeals particularly to them. 

HERBS OF MEDICAL VALUE 

Those living in the city have practically no use for many plants and 
herbs, roots and barks which are so valuable for home remedies, but there are 
some of the more common vegetable products that have such great household 
value as remedies that we give here a few of them and some of their uses. 

BEAN. — Frequent poultices of soft-boiled navy beans applied to parts 
affected with erysipelas in its early stages have made many cures. 

BEET. — A syrup made from the boiled-down juice of the common beet 
is excellent for gravel, and will also aid delayed menstruation. 

CELERY. — Eating freely of this vegetable and drinking the water in 
which it has been boiled until soft is a great aid in soothing and curing rheu- 
matism. 

CRANBERRY. — Poultices made of pounded cranberries afford great 
relief when applied to piles. Eating them freely will also help. A tablespoon- 
ful daily of concentrated extract of cranberry is excellent for hysteria. 

DANDELION. — The wine of this plant, described in the "Department 
of Cooking and Foods" is an excellent blood-purifying spring drink. 

LEMON. — The juice of this fruit is a common remedy for scurvy, and 
is used largely to allay thirst in fever cases. It is claimed by some physicians 
to be excellent for rheumatism and gout, and mixed with onion juice and 
molasses is an old-fashioned remedy for coughs and colds. It is very useful 
in taking away disagreeable tastes of medicines. 

ONION. — Hardly any plant furnishes more or better home remedies 
than the onion. Cooked as a sauce and eaten freely it is a cure for constipa- 
tion. Cut into slices and sprinkled with sugar, a syrup is formed which is 
excellent in croup, the dose being a teaspoonful every fifteen or twenty min- 
utes, till relief is had. A crushed onion poultice will extract the heat and pain 
of a burn or scald. The squeezed juice of the onion, mixed with sugar, and 
given in teaspoonful doses every three or four hours is highly recommended 
as a cure for bronchitis. 



184 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 



PARSLEY. — A decoction of parsley is used to increase the secretion 
of urine in dropsical cases. 

PEPPER. — Red pepper makes an excellent gargle in scarlet fever, by 
mixing half a teaspoonful with a tablespoonful of salt in a pint of water and 
adding a cup of vinegar. A tea made of red pepper pods has often been very 
effective in cases of la grippe. 

PINEAPPLE. — The juice of this fruit, taken in tablespoonful doses 
every three hours and used as a gargle brings great relief in diphtheria. 

PUMPKINS. — The seeds of pumpkin afford a well-recognized remedy 
for worms, retention of urine and inflammation of the bladder and bowels. Oil 
of the seeds operates as a speedy diuretic in doses of from six to ten drops 
four or five times a day. If a tea of the seeds be used as a diuretic it may be 
drank freely at intervals of two or three hours. Pumpkin seeds are highly 
recommended for the destruction and removal of tape worms. The seeds 
should be peeled and beaten in with sugar till a paste is formed. Then dilute 
with milk and drink freely, always on an empty stomach. In the course of a 
few hours the patient should take an active cathartic for the removal of the 
tape worm, composed of a tablespoonful of castor oil and the same quantity 
of turpentine. The drug stores now furnish a fluid extract of pumpkin seeds 
for the destruction of tape worm, the dose being from a half to a whole table- 
spoonful every three or four hours, followed, as before mentioned, by a large 
dose of castor oil and turpentine. 

RADISH. — Frequent eating of these vegetables is claimed by some 
doctors to be excellent in case of Bright's disease. 

TOMATO. — The tomato remedy for cholera infantum meets with much 
favor by those who have tried it. It is prepared by adding sugar to peeled 
ripe tomatoes, crushed. The dose is a teaspoonful every half hour until re- 
lieved; then continue with like doses every two or three hours till a permanent 
cure is effected. Some remarkable cures are mentioned in connection with 
this simple remedy. 

INVALIDS. 

CARE. — Give the patient as large and as sunny a room as 
possible. It is better that there be no carpet on the floor. Remove 
dust from furniture with a damp cloth, and wipe floor with a damp 
cloth instead of sweeping it. Have bed so placed that door and win- 
dows can be opened without placing patient in a draught. Keep the room 
thoroughly aired by occasionally opening the windows at the top and bottom. 
Before doing this, put a blanket over the patient's body and head to prevent 
taking cold, and do not remove the blanket until the room is warm again. See 
that the bed linen is kept clean, and under sheet drawn tightly to avoid wrin- 
kles. In cases of fever, allow patient to have cold water, other cool and re- 
refreshing drinks and cracked ice. Keep all drinks carefully covered. Give a 
sponge bath every day if the doctor permits. Be especially careful that food 
for the sick is cooked and served in very clean pans and dishes, and that all 
dishes used by the patient are thoroughly cleansed before being used by anyone 
else. Prepare and give food in very small quantities, and serve it on the pret- 
tiest dishes in the house. Never leave food, fruit or dirty dishes standing in 
the sick room, and never allow food or drink that has been left by the patient 



DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 185 

to be taken by others. Keep the house as quiet as possible. Never slam doors 
or windows, and do not speak in a loud voice, nor whisper in the room, but 
speak in gentle tones. 

NURSING. 

SCIENCE. — Value. There is no room to doubt that faithful, intelligent 
and efficient care of the sick is often responsible in large measure for recovery 
from attacks of severe illness and that the ministrations of the well-qualified 
nurse are second only in importance to skillful medical attendance. In fact, 
there are diseases in which good nursing is more essential to the welfare of 
the patient than medicines, and in which these would be of little avail, unless 
accompanied by conscientious services of this character. 

The nurse is the physician's assistant, and he often depends, in forming 
his estimate of the condition and needs of his patient, largely upon the obser- 
vation and judgment of the one who is in constant attendance on the case, who 
sees the changes which occur at different times of day or night, who notes the 
effects of this remedy or of that food, and who makes to him reports based 
upon what transpires during his absence. 

Thus he often gains valuable suggestions regarding the course and man- 
agement of the case from what, to the inexperienced and untrained, might be 
considered a trivial symptom or a circumstance not worth repeating. 

It is not the office of the nurse to discriminate between the important 
and unimportant features of a case, but to endeavor to give the medical at- 
tendant a faithful picture of the case as she has seen it, leaving it for him 
to weigh the evidence given, to form a just estimate of its value. On his de- 
parture the responsibility for the execution of his orders devolves upon her 
and until his return it is she who assumes control of the case and gives di- 
rections. 

The science of nursing is its theory — the mastery of its technical details 
— the knowledge of the subject which is acquired by observation, study and 
experience. This embraces information on such matters as the care of the 
patient, including moving, bathing, dressing, and attending to his wants and 
comfort; such details as relate particularly to the management of the case, as 
taking temperature, pulse and respiration, observing symptoms, administering 
medicines and applying external agents; the preparation and giving of food 
and drink; the care of the room, attention to the room, including its general 
cleanliness, order, disinfection, heat and ventilation; and the care of the bed, 
etc. 

ART. — The art of nursing, on the contrary, is its practice — the mode of 
application of the details learned. For a proper exercise of the art, there 
should be not merely a knowledge of the science, but certain natural physical 
and mental endowments. Like the poet, she who would successfully engage 
in the art of nursing, must be born, not made. As in every line of employ- 
ment, there are in this those who do not possess the requisite qualifications, 
and it is not infrequently the case that nursing devolves upon friends or rela- 
tives of the sick, who assume the duties, not because of any special fitness for 
the work, but because of sentiment or necessity. A brief consideration will 
be given to what some of these qualifications are, as a guide to those seeking 
such information. 

QUALIFICATIONS. DISPOSITION.— Lamentable failure will in- 
evitably attend the efforts of any one attempting to nurse, if she has not a 



186 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 

suitable disposition. The qualities which constitute an ideal disposition for a 
nurse unfortunately are rarely all found in one person. It will nevertheless 
be useful to consider some of the most important of them. 

AMIABILITY. — Essentially the product of a benevolent nature, this is 
a trait of prime importance. A spontaneous flow of kind acts and considerate 
attentions should characterize a nurse; whereas, irritability of the temper and 
thoughtless and inconsiderate acts are so inexcusable as to at once disqualify 
her for her work. Therefore, she must naturally be kind in thought, word 
and deed. 

SYMPATHY. — Sympathy with a patient's distress, without weak sen- 
timentality is an outgrowth of this attitude of mind, which is of value to the 
nurse and of benefit to the patient, if not too freely exercised. 

CHEERFULNESS. — A bright and sunny disposition not only brings 
life, hope and cheer into the sick room, and thus aids in the favorable progress 
of the case, but sheds its influence through the entire household, lightening the 
burden of trouble from those who are in distress. The sick room is not the 
place for a gloomy or morose person. 

UNSELFISHNESS. — Disregard for personal comfort and convenience, 
and untiring devotion to the interests of the patient are demanded of the nurse. 
Hers should be largely a labor of love, in conformity with which she should 
be willing to sacrifice herself in behalf of her patient. 

CALMNESS. — A nurse with an excitable temperament, who is upset 
by trivial circumstances, and who even in an extremity exhibits lack of com- 
posure, will not tend to tranquilize a patient who is already in the state of 
nervous irritability. Cool judgment, calm demeanor, and, when not accom- 
panied by hesitancy, deliberate action, will tend to inspire confidence in her 
intelligence and proficiency, a fact of no little importance in serious illness. 

PATIENCE. — The trying circumstances incident to the sick room and 
the exacting requirements of the patient, often call for the exercise of the 
most unbounded patience. Those who are ordinarily thoughtful and consid- 
erate are frequently, when sick, unreasonable in the extreme, and their de- 
mands for attentions, which are often unnecessary, become most exasperating. 

FIRMNESS. — It is desirable for the nurse to be sufficiently resolute 
to secure compliance with her instructions, but it is not needful to maintain, 
as is often done, a dogged and uncompromising attitude, and to be immovable 
to appeal in non-essentials. Arbitrary refusal in such matters creates antag- 
onism on the part of the patient, which more than counter-balances what has 
been gained by the nurse and which materially lessens her influence and use- 
fulness. 

TACT. — Not only in these matters, but in her general deportment in the 
sick room is there opportunity for the exercise of tact. To divert the patient 
from an undesirable train of thought without making it apparent; to be dis- 
creet about the subject of conversation, neither unbosoming all her family 
affairs nor detailing the histories of all her previous cases; to avoid either 
depressing, exciting, tiresome or otherwise objectionable topics when reading; 
to regulate the matter of visitors without giving offense; in these and in man- 
ifold ways are shown the importance of having good, sound common sense, a 
quality unfortunately far toe rare among those who engage in this art. 



DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 187 

OBSERVATION.— The nurse should be a careful observer, able to 
notice differences in the condition of the patient, and to recognize at least 
in a measure the meaning of symptoms which she sees. Frequently it is left 
to her judgment to give more or less of medicine prescribed, or to change 
one remedy for another, according to the condition of the patient, and a fail- 
ure to correctly observe and properly interpret what is seen will work to the 
detriment of the patient. 

PHYSICAL SOUNDNESS.— The strain, physical and nervous, caused 
by untiring vigilance, loss of sleep, irregular meals, confinement to the sick 
room, and anxiety, are such as to make essential to the nurse an exceptionally 
sound, healthy body, endowed with the power of endurance. In addition there 
should be good vision, good hearing and good sense of smell, all of these 
faculties being called into frequent requisition. 

CONDUCT. — Granted that a nurse has enough qualifications to make 
her an efficient nurse, there are still some details pertaining to her personal 
conduct in the sick room, and which are largely under her control, the ob- 
servance or neglect of which will often make the difference between her being 
acceptable or not to her patients. Some of these are quite essential, while 
others may appear to be of little consequence, yet to those suffering from 
severe illness they are no trifles; mole-hills appear as mountains, and the insig- 
nificant become matters of great moment, and these very trifles often have 
much to do with the comfort and peace of mind of the one under the nurse's 
care. 

Reference is had to such matters as dress, personal appearance and 
habits, movements, manner of speaking, touch, etc. 

CLOTHING. — The outer clothing of the nurse should be of plain, 
modest color and preferably of wash material, an indispensable requirement 
in infectious cases. Starched clothing should not be so stiff as to make a 
constant rustling with every movement. The shoes should be noiseless. 

SPEECH. — The nurse should endeavor to speak distinctly and evenly, 
though never abruptly nor in loud and rasping tones. Equally objectionable 
is it to whisper, as this almost invariably is annoying to the patient if he is 
awake. 

The voice should be cheerful and reassuring and calculated to inspire 
with hope and confidence. Very many questions of the patient must be an- 
swered adroitly, yet in such a manner as not to convey the impression that 
attempts are being made to conceal from him what he desires to know. 

TOUCH. — The hands should be always warm, smooth and scrupulously 
clean and nails well-trimmed. A combination of gentleness and firmness is 
to be desired in handling and moving the patient, efforts of this sort being 
steady and deliberate, not sudden and jerking. 

APPEARANCE. — General neatness of the hair and person should be 
strictly regarded. She who is careless of her appearance and tidiness will 
presumably be equally so of the one under her charge. 

MANNER. — If a nurse is lacking in the ability to make herself accept- 
able to her patient she is confronted by an insuperable obstacle to success. 
This will depend almost wholly on her deportment in the sick room. An awk- 
ward, boisterous, bustling nurse will not compare favorably with one who 
quietly and unobtrusively accomplishes her task without confusion and noise. 
Nor, on the other hand, will the nurse who stealthily creeps around on tip-toe 
be likely to prove acceptable to her patient. 



188 DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 

STUDY OF DISPOSITION.— A studious observance of the patient's 
disposition and a readily ascertainable knowledge of his likes and dislikes will 
soon enable the nurse to anticipate his wants, to scrupulously avoid that which 
is likely to annoy and secure for him that which will give comfort and pleasure 
or bring repose of body or mind. It is this considerateness for the wishes and 
feelings of the patient which so often constitutes the difference between suc- 
cess and failure, and the lack of which to a sensitive nature is a constant source 
of irritation and annoyance. 

WHAT A NURSE SHOULD AVOID.— A nurse should not forget that 
a person's progress toward recovery is retarded by such practices as the fol- 
lowing: To rock incessantly in a squeaky chair; to sit and constantly tap with 
the foot or fingers; to noisily prepare for bed in the room after the patient is 
ready to sleep; to so time the administration of food and medicine, where this 
can be avoided, as to disturb the patient just as he is settled comfortably for 
a nap; to be continually asking whether he would like something done for 
him; to make unnecessary noise with dishes or papers; to allow the light to 
shine uncomfortably in his eyes; to hurry him with his meals; to shake his 
bed, etc. 

SLEEP. 

CONDITIONS. — In order to aid nature in this, her great free and 
natural physician, sleeping apartments should always be well ventilated to 
allow a constant changing of the air. A small opening of the windows, top and 
bottom, will give the desired result. Have the bed as comfortable as possible, 
and use only enough covers to protect from discomfort by cold. Never cover 
warm enough to cause perspiration, unless to relieve fever. Sleep with the 
head of the bed to the east if possible, but do not place it so the light from 
the windows will shine directly in the eyes of the sleeper. Remove all pets, 
fish, cut flowers or other unhealthy surroundings before retiring. 

HOURS. — The hours of sleep required can best be told by the individual. 
Some need more than others, both from constitutional causes and from the 
effects of hours of employment. Habits may incapacitate a person for judging 
the necessary amount of sleep required to such an extent that they may injure 
their health by too little or too much. Growing children, and persons of very 
active brain, require a lot of sleep. Children from four to twelve years of age 
should have nine hours a day unless they awaken naturally. Give the subject 
some thought and make your own observations, and you will soon find how 
much is best for you. Physical condition also alters the amount of sleep 
needed, and in a weakened condition nature will call for more hours of relaxa- 
tion in which to do her rebuilding work. 

POSITION. — The most approved position for sleeping is stretched out 
fairly straight on the right side. This prevents the weight of the body from 
restricting the action of the heart. Avoid raising the arms above the head or 
sleeping tightly "curled up." Sleeping on the back causes snoring and dry- 
ness of the throat, and also induces dreams. The head should rest on some- 
thing soft enough to shape itself in some degrees to the head, and should be 
level or slightly raised, never on a high pile of pillows. 

VALUE. — Wholesome sleep is one of the great points of health. Nature 
then sets to work to repair the damage done during the day, and works with 



DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND HYGIENE 189 

greater knowledge and surer methods than the best doctor. After a night 
of proper sleep, a person should awaken rested, clear of brain and full of 
ambition, unless they are sick. 

SLEEPLESSNESS. — This is usually caused by an excess amount of 
blood in the head, on account of poor circulation. Unless chronic, or caused 
by illness, it can often be cured by a cold bath, short, strenuous exercise, or 
brisk rubbing and chafing of the body and limbs. These will help to restore 
the circulation of the blood and relieve the pressure on the brain, and should 
be done just before retiring. Where these fail to have the desired effect, some 
cases will be relieved by drinking warm hop tea on retiring, and sleeping on a 
pillow filled with hops. 

TEETH. 

CARE. — Attention to the teeth should begin early in life, even during 
the period of first teeth. Decay of the "milk" teeth should be prevented and 
filling is just as important as with the permanent set. The temporary teeth 
must be removed in due time if they do not fall out themselves and the perma- 
nent ones must be trained to fill their places. The teeth should be cleaned 
five times a day — morning, bedtime and after each meal. A soft brush is 
better than a stiff one so as not to wound the gums. The best dentifrice is 
water; but sometimes a little prepared chalk or white castile soap may be 
used. The too frequent use of powders containing cuttlefish bone or charcoal 
will injure the enamel of the teeth. When the gums are tender and tend to 
bleed add a few drops of tincture of myrrh to the water. It is a good rule to 
visit the dentist once each season to find out the exact condition of these im- 
portant organs. Never lose a tooth if art can save it. The shape of the jaw 
and face is altered by the removal of teeth. When, by reason of a collection 
of tartar on the teeth a powder is desired for its removal, your dentist will 
recommend a good one. 

VENTILATION. 

The great remedy against impure air is proper ventilation. By experi- 
ment and calculation it is found that, in order to keep up the admitted stand- 
ard of purity, it is requisite that three thousand cubic feet of perfectly pure 
air should flow into a room hourly for every grown person in it. Of course, 
an equal amount of more or less vitiated air must escape in order for the pure 
air to take its place. If there be lights in the room, more pure air is needed. 
The ordinary gas light consumes the oxygen of about twenty-five cubic feet 
hourly, and produces nearly as much carbonic acid gas as ten men would pro- 
duce in the same space of time. Sick people, especially those with lung dis- 
eases and putrid fevers, should have a very great amount of fresh air. A 
great majority of deaths are due to the fact that people do not get enough 
fresh air. Warm air is lighter than cold air and tends to escape at the upper 
part of the room, while its place is supplied by cold air which flows in at the 
lower part of the room. In all sleeping rooms and rooms that are occupied 
a great deal during the day, the windows should be opened both at the top 
and bottom, more or less, according to the weather, and also according to the 
size of the room; more for large rooms and less for small rooms. 

WOUNDS.

WRINKLES. 

PREVENTING.— See "Complexion." 

REMOVING. — There are a number of good ways of removing wrinkles, 
but the first of all of these must be, of course, health. No method can remove 
wrinkles if they come from frowning and worrying, unless the cause is re- 
moved. So, be well and happy, and then if you have wrinkles that you don't 
want, use a good face cream and massage faithfully morning and night with 
a circular or diagonal motion. Also rub along both sides of the wrinkle 
whenever you think of it during the day. Much may be accomplished also 
by placing adhesive plaster over the wrinkles in such a way that the wrinkle 
cannot be formed while it is on. Thoughtfulness will enable you to keep your 
face free from wrinkles, and no one would ever have them if they gave the 
necessary care and thought to their prevention. 



DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 191

BEDS. 

CARE. — No housewife in a large city has any insurance against the in- 
trusion of unwelcome company in her beds, and this will cause her more care 
in the keeping of them than anything else. In the matter of health, the care 
of the beds is of great importance. Every bed should have all covers removed 
when vacated, and hung to air before open windows. The mattresses should 
be aired and then turned over and the other side aired before making the bed. 
Reversing the mattresses daily will make the bed more healthy and com- 
fortable, and will lengthen the life of the mattress. In making beds, always 
pull the covers firmly and smoothly over the mattress. If they have become 
wrinkled during the night, tuck them tightly under the mattress, leaving the 
outside cover only to drape the sides. Do not allow damp air to come in con- 
tact with bed clothing or beds. A healthy bed should be dry and sweet. 

BUGS. — It is a hundred times more easy to prevent these intruders than 
to get rid of them when established, and this can only be accomplished by 
constant watchfulness. Bugs may be brought into the home from stores, rail- 
way stations, offices, and especially street cars, and some are carried from 
house to house by bats, mice, sparrows or chimney birds. Some women have 
an idea that it looks disgraceful to have evidences of bug powder or pre- 
ventives about, but we do not consider it so, and advise everyone to take such 
precautions, because they are liable to be brought to her house, and the safest 
way to protect herself is to give them an unpleasant reception. For use about 
the beds, persian insect powder or like, blown into the cracks and crevices 
occasionally, will usually prevent their remaining. There are many liquid prep- 
arations on the market that are effective, but care must be used in selecting 
them, as some are injurious to fabric and wall paper, and others will cause rust 
to any metal. A mixture of equal parts turpentine and ten per cent, solution 
of carbolic acid applied to the cracks of the floor and bottom of the surbases 
will prevent them from remaining there. 

CLEANING. — This is a weak point with many housekeepers. Even 
some who are very particular about the bed clothing neglect the bed itself. 
The bed is exposed to the exhalations from body and lungs, and should be 
wiped off frequently with a damp cloth. For those who use powder as a pre- 
ventive, we wish to state that the virtue of the powder is gone in about a week, 
and at least once a week the bed should be thoroughly dusted in all parts be- 
fore being wiped off. This may be done largely with a duster or brush, but the 
little powder-gun, empty, is a very great assistant in blowing the dust from 
otherwise inaccessible places. Blow the dust out of the hidden places lightly, 
so that it will not fly about and deposit its load of germs all over the room. 

CLOTHING. — This matter is, of course, largely governed by choice and 
finance, but there is one very important point about it that should be taken 



192 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 

into consideration, and that is that nature makes the body throw off the im- 
purities while we sleep. This is done through the breath and also the pores 
of the skin, and is accompanied by more or less dampness. If this dampness 
is so closely covered in that it cannot escape it saturates the clothing and 
some of it gets back into the system. Much ill-health is caused by too much 
bed clothing. Mattresses should be used rather than feathers or soft bedding, 
and just enough clothing used to keep the sleepers warm. Never allow the bed 
clothes to cover the face. 

BEDROOMS. 

CARE. — If you value health, be just as particular about the care of your 
bedrooms as you are of ycur parlor. Cleanliness is absolutely essential. All 
dust should be carefully removed and the rooms should be made as attractive 
and cheerful as possible. The surroundings where we fall asleep undoubtedly 
have an influence on our rest, and the first impression on awakening may affect 
the entire day. Bedroom decorations should be simple, and only such as can 
be readily cleaned. Growing plants in bedrooms will absorb the human 
poisons, while cut flowers will throw off poisons that are injurious to persons. 
It is best not to have plants of any kind in a bedroom. Bedroom vessels 
should never remain uncovered. 

VENTILATION. — This runs close to cleanliness in importance in the 
matter of healthy bedrooms. Every bedroom should be thoroughly aired after 
the sleepers have arisen, probably for an hour or two, according to the condi- 
tion of the weather, and should be well aired again before retiring. In fair 
weather you cannot have too much fresh air if there are no direct drafts al- 
lowed to reach the sleepers. In cold weather shut off all heat, close the door, 
and raise the window three or four inches from the bottom, and lower six 
inches from the top. If there are two windows, raise one and lower the other. 
This will cause a mild circulation that will completely change the air in the 
room every hour. There are certain weather conditions when this method of 
ventilation must be modified. If the wind is blowing directly into the windows, 
place something before the opening to deflect the draft, and reduce the open- 
ings until no strong current of air is felt when in bed. On heavy, misty nights, 
when dampness enters, very little ventilation is advisable, as the dampness is 
objectionable, and more or less of the ventilation will occur from the im- 
perfections about the windows. These regulations must, of course, be altered 
to suit persons of delicate health, invalids, and those especially susceptible to 
colds. If a number of persons have been sitting in the room during the even- 
ing, or if there has been any smoking, or other vitiating influence, the room 
should be thoroughly aired before retiring. 

CARPETS. 

CARE. — The first essential in the care of carpets is cleanliness. Nothing 
wears a carpet quicker than dirt at the bottom of the nap, which acts as a grind 
whenever it is stepped on. Carpets should be laid only on dry floors, or the 
tacks will rust and injure it, and the under part may become affected by mildew. 
See that the parts most used are on a perfectly smooth surface. This may be 
done by padding the rough places with carpet lining or spread papers. If a 
certain part is exposed to much more wear than others, lay it so that it may 
be turned often, thus causing it to wear more evenly. Do not allow heavy 
furniture to set in one spot long enough to crush the nap of the carpet.

194 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 

CLEANING. — Many housekeepers use damp tea leaves when sweeping, 
but in the summer they can do better by using freshly-cut grass. It will not 
stain, as tea leaves sometimes do, and leaves the carpet looking fresh and 
bright. In sweeping carpet, sweep with the nap, not against it, and always 
draw the broom rather than push it before you. This saves carpet and broom, 
too. The regular carpet sweeping should be light but insistent, with a whisk- 
ing motion, and the carpets should be thoroughly cleaned occasionally, even if 
not taken up. This can be done by repeated hard sweepings, followed by care- 
ful wiping of the surface with cloths wrung out of cold water or some restoring 
mixture. In these days of modern devices, however, carpet cleaning may be 
accomplished in a more sanitary and much easier way with the vacuum clean- 
ers. These suck the dirt out of the nap and prevent it from flying about the 
room, are labor-saving, and do away with the wear of hard sweeping. These 
devices are now reasonably cheap, and may be secured to work by electricity, 
foot or hand power. Carpets which have been taken up are best cleaned by 
compressed air. There are establishments in the city using this process, and it 
is with satisfaction that the housewife sees her carpets come back to her per- 
fectly clean, to be laid on her well-cleaned floors. In this process the carpets 
are laid singly over a wire screen and the compressed air forced through 
them. This drives all the dust out of them without wear, and a suction fan 
carries it away so that the dust and germs are destroyed. Valuable Oriental 
rugs that must not be beaten or swept hard may be thoroughly cleaned in this 
manner without danger. 

RESTORING. — One of the best mixtures for cleaning and restoring the 
colors of carpets is an ounce of beef-gall in a pail of cold water. Clean the car- 
pet thoroughly, and wipe the surface hard with clothes wrung out of the gall 
water. This will make a slight foam, which should be wiped off with damp 
cloths in fresh cold water. After the carpet is wiped, air well until the carpet 
is perfectly dry. Stained or particularly dirty spots should be cleaned with a 
stronger solution of gall. A little alum dissolved in the cleaning water will 
also help to restore the colors. 

CELLARS. 

The care of this part of the house is often neglected by otherwise ex- 
cellent housekeepers, and yet this is one of the most important parts of the 
house, especially if the house is heated by hot air. The natural course of air 
in a house is upward, and this gives us one of our greatest sources of air from 
the cellar. If this is germ- or dust-laden or impure, such conditions are bound 
to exist throughout the entire house. Anyone may easily demonstrate this by 
placing in the cellar something with a strong odor, and they will find that in 
a very short time it is noticeable all over the house. Then, too, at least part of 
the food supply is apt to come from the cellar and should not be exposed to 
contamination. If there is a hot-air heater in the cellar, the rising heat forces 
a draft to be taken in about the heater, commonly near the floor. For this 
reason, cold-air ducts are run out through a window and connected with the 
base of the heaters. Cellars should be kept clean, and should be well-aired 
often, and exposed to direct sunlight as much as possible. Damp or wet cellars 
are a constant menace to the health of all in the house, for germs breed rapidly 
in damp, stagnant air, and poisonous gases are formed under the same condi- 
tions. Ashes may be prevented from falling about by taking up carefully and 
then covering or sprinkling quickly. Do not allow material to accumulate in

such manner that it cannot be readily cleaned, and clean walls and ceilings 
often, as well as the floor. Whitewash is a natural antidote for all the evils of 
the cellar, and in cellars where ideal conditions are impossible, frequent white- 
washing is a great help. The top of the heater and the upper sides of thei 
heater pipes are notorious dust collectors that often escape the eye of the 
cleanser. Be careful to allow no decaying matter, either animal or vegetable, 
to remain in the cellar. Coal should be sprinkled occasionally, to prevent the 
dust from rising. 

CHINA. 

The higher grades of this ware are sometimes as valuable as cut glass, 
and often more susceptible to spoilage. Great care should be taken to avoid 
chipping or "spalling" off of the enamel by sudden changes of temperature. 
Fine china should be washed in warm water and then placed in clean warm 
water and heated gradually to the scalding point and allowed to cool slowly. 
If very dirty, so that scouring is necessary, use fullers earth powdered very 
fine, and sifted. Fine, thin china when extremely cold or hot will break from a 
very slight shock. 

CLOTHING. 

CARE. — The life of articles of clothing may be materially lengthened 
by care, and it is an important item of personal economy. The habit may be 
hard to acquire unless started early in life, but when once you get into the 
habit of caring for your clothing systematically you will find it is not much 
trouble, and does not take much time compared with the results achieved. 
Smaller articles which are kept in drawers should be kept neatly folded and 
ready to get at. If they are allowed to get tumbled, creases form and time is 
lost. When clothing is removed it should be brushed and shaken, and hung 
to air in such a way that no damage can be done it by creasing. After airing, 
if it is not to be worn again soon, put it away carefully, so that the shape of 
the garment may be preserved and no strain or wear come on the fabric. 
Clothing that is kept clean will far outlast that which is not. 

CLEANING. — A volume could be written on this subject to cover in 
detail all materials for clothing, so we will only endeavor to give some brief 
general hints, covering as broad a field as possible. All clothing should be kept 
free from dust or dry dirt all the time, and this should be done first of all if 
the garment is to be cleaned. After this is done, if there are grease-spots, 
paint, varnish or smears, take two ounces of household ammonia, a quart of 
soft water and a teaspoonful of saltpetre, mix well together, and dissolve in it 
an ounce of free-lathering soap, scraped fine. This will dissolve in from two 
to five hours, according to the soap, if shaken occasionally. This mixture will 
quickly remove almost any spots a person is liable to get on their clothes. Lay 
the garment out smooth, single thickness if possible, on top of a smooth, dry 
cloth. Apply the mixture on a rag or scrub brush, and repeat two or three 
times. Rub the wet spots as dry as possible and press with a hot iron. A 
teacupful of this mixture and a tablespoonful of beef-gall in a gallon of water 
may be used for thoroughly cleaning outer-garments, as it will remove all 
grease and dirt without injury to the fabric, and will brighten and restore the 
colors. One teaspoonful of beef-gall and a quarter pound of extract of log- 
wood in a gallon of water will clean and restore colors in silks, woolens and

cotton goods without injury, and is especially good for "scouring" men's wear. 
Soiled or faded ties, ribbons and dress goods may be made almost equal to 
new in this way. 

CUT GLASS. 

The handling of this beautiful household ornament and utility should be 
practically the same as prescribed for fine china under the heading "China" in 
this department. 

DAMPNESS. 

Especially in small rooms or closets, the bad effects of dampness may be 
overcome to a great degree by placing a saucer or two of quicklime in it. This 
will not only absorb the dampness, but will disinfect the place. As the lime 
becomes "air-slacked," renew it. 



DECORATIONS. 

GENERAL. — The evidence of taste in decorating the home is not shown 
by any great display of expenditure. Some persons can spend money lavishly 
and still have their home poorly furnished and decorated, while others, who 
study effects and use taste, will have the "house beautiful" at very slight cost. 
Nevertheless, money to spend for this purpose will always be a great help, and 
the wise housewife will arrange to suit her pocketbook. The furnishings of a 
house are no small part of the decorations, as are also the wall coverings. As 
many of our readers will live in rented homes, where they cannot control the 
wall decorations, they must make a compromise, and do the best they can 
under the circumstances. The suggestions we will give will be based upon your 
being able to control the furnishings and decorations entirely, with a limited 
amount of money to spend on them. 

PARLOR. — The parlor should be furnished plainly and richly. If the 
room is small, use as small furniture as possible, but not of a light bric-a-brac 
type. Have it strong and plain and rich. Unless the room is dark, use darker 
colors than in the rest of the house, as the richest effects are produced in 
heavy colors. Avoid useless bric-a-brac and ornaments, and have the pictures 
few and good, and framed in plain, rich, dark frames, except oil paintings, 
which should be framed in gold. Aim to have the carpet correspond with the 
paper and furniture, and light the room from a drop light on the table, covered 
by a shade that harmonizes with the room and lights the lower part highly, 
but leaves the upper part in reflected light. This gives the room a cozy appear- 
ance. On festive occasions, by lighting completely, the effect is more brilliant. 
Do not use large patterns of carpet or paper in small rooms. 

DINING-ROOM. — Massive furniture is out of place in the dining-room. 
It should be of medium weight, strong and plain. Very delightful effects can 
be produced with strong colors in carpet and paper base, with broad plate rail 
at the top of base, and lighter paper above. If possible, light the room at night 
from a large dome over the centre of the table. Always keep in mind the fact 
that it is here we go to appease the appetite, and the decoration of the room 
has a strong influence on the impression the meal makes upon those who are 
gathered at the table. The pictures should be of cheerful and appetizing sub- 
jects, bright colors, and lightly framed. Do everything possible to give the 
room an appearance of spotless cleanliness.

DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 



KITCHEN. — Pure decorations are less important here than in any other 
part of the house. It must be kept in mind by the housewife that the more 
pleasant the room is, the more pleasant will be her duties if she does her own 
work, and the less trouble she will have in securing good servants. In fur- 
nishing the kitchen, usefulness should be the first requisite, but the surround- 
ings should be made as attractive as possible. There are certain plants that 
will thrive in a kitchen window unless it is too near the stove, and there may 
be a few wall decorations. A good clock is an absolute necessity, and an at- 
tractive calendar should always be in sight. The numerous little conveniences 
about the room should be made so that they decorate. 

SITTING-ROOM.— The sitting-room or library should be furnished with 
the heaviest and easiest furniture in the house, for it is here we go for rest or 
pastime, and everything should be suggestive of comfort. Here should be the 
rich, deep colors and the careful lighting, with bright carpet and pictures that 
carry out the idea of comfortable living. Plain and roomy furniture always has 
a comfortable and inviting appearance. The light should be so arranged that all 
may have good illumination of their work, but the glare of direct light should 
never be directly in the eyes. The ornaments should be souvenirs of travel or 
hunt, busts of authors, or like, plain, rich and few. Here should be the house- 
hold pets, such as birds or fish. A great deal may be accomplished toward the 
decoration of this room by the tasty arrangement of books in their cases, and a 
careful selection of just what ones to place on the table to produce the "comfy" 
appearance. 

BEDROOMS. — In this part of the house, if any, the bric-a-brac and 
fancy things that appeal to the ladies may be tolerated, but they must bear in 
mind that the more they place about the walls or room, the more there is to 
harbor dust and germs to endanger their health, and the more work they have 
in cleaning the room. Every woman likes to have her bureau or dresser well 
appointed with dainty toilet articles, but they should be moved and cleaned 
daily. Bedroom furniture should be of the lighter build, and light in color, too, 
if possible, as it is here that we seek repose, and our minds should be impressed 
with a light and airy impression that will drive away thoughts of care or work, 
and secure us refreshing slumber. The carpets and wall coverings should be 
light and delicate, such as a mild floral design. Where rooms communicate, 
carpet them the same if possible, and see that paper and furniture harmonize 
with the floor covering. The pictures should be lightly and brightly framed, 
and be of such subjects as induce rest or appeal personally to the occupant. 
Likenesses of dear friends or favorites are always wise decorations for bed- 
rooms. Here should be the house plants that the tenant has under their especial 
car. Very pleasing effects may be made with novel draperies at the doors and 
windows. 

DISH-WASHING. 

Scrape the food from the dishes, collect each kind and put in a pile by 
itself. Have a pan of hot, soapy water, wash glasses first, cups and saucers 
next, and then silver. Rinse each dish in clean, hot water, drain, and wipe 
on clean, dry cloths. Wash, rinse, drain and wipe plates and the dirtier dishes. 
Wipe out very greasy pots and pans with soft paper, before washing, and 
always wash them in very hot, soapy water. Wipe frying pans and kettles 
with dishcloth wrung dry; further dry by placing them on the stove shelf. All 
cooking dishes should be put to soak in cold water immediately after using.

DEAR MADAM : 

The entrance into married life and going to housekeeping hrings ■with it new 
duties and problems. 

One of the problems you will be called on to solve is : 

"WHAT SOAP SHALL I USE?"

Never put handles of steel knives into the water, but wash with the dish- 
cloth. The handle of an egg-beater should never be put into water, as washing 
the oil out of the gears causes the beater to turn hard. Wash, rinse and 
hang to dry all dish towels every time they are used. 

DRESSMAKING. 

If you are going to have a dressmaker at the house, be sure that all is 
in readiness for her so that no time will be lost in waiting for supplies or going 
out to get them. See that the machine is in good order, that you have all 
necessary buttons, linings, and trimmings, and that there are suitable needles, 
thread, etc., ready and convenient. 

What might be called "store sewing" has made much of what women 
used to sew so cheap that the housewife does far less nowadays than she did 
a few years back, but there is so much that can and should be done in this 
line that she who is untrained in the art of needlework is sadly lacking in 
household ability. The woman who can make her own dresses can have twice 
as many on the same amount of money as one who must always pay a dress- 
maker, and she can, by alterations and her own ingenuity, have the equivalent 
of three or four times as many. Time and trouble as well as money are saved 
by knowledge of the use of needle and thread. You do the work at your own 
convenience, repairs and alterations are made at practically no outlay, and 
garments are repaired and used that would be thrown away if a bill for repair- 
ing had to be incurred. To the busy housewife who does other work about 
her home, sitting down to sew will act as a change and rest, and it is always 
a useful pastime and part of the natural sphere of the "queen of home." There 
is a daintiness and distinction about hand sewing that separates its wearer 
from the great mass of women of a city and gives her an air of distinction. 

A famous writer has said: "Have a work-basket, no matter how plain 
it may be, as a receptacle for spools of thread and silk, thimble, large cutting 
scissors, and a small, pointed pair for ripping; a measuring tape, piece of bees- 
wax, needles of various sizes, a little muslin bag for buttons, and a second 
one for hooks and eyes off the cards. Linen, cotton and silk threads all have 
their use; so do twist and the cheap basting cotton, which need never be very 
coarse. 

"For sewing on buttons, hooks and eyes, etc., twenty to forty thread is 
generally used, while fifty to eighty are the most used numbers on sewing 
machines. 

"Select a needle according to the fabric to be sewed, and err on the side 
of fineness. Thread the needle with the end of the cotton or silk coming first 
from the spool. Make a small knot at the end of the thread, which should be 
about a yard in length. Sewing a seam is the first thing taught and requires 
backstitching, running, or overcasting. The latter is used with two selvedge 
edges, which should be basted evenly, using inch-long stitches with an equal 
space between. Then hold the work with the left hand and oversew the edges, 
going but two or three threads below the edge and inserting the needle diag- 
onally, pointing to the left, with the stitches close, but not touching over the 
top. Backstitching is one stitch forward and the next one back, so as to form 
a continual row of neat even stitches. 'Running' is done evenly by counting 
the threads, as a stitch of five over the needle, then five under, and so on, with 
an occasional back stitch to keep the seam firmly in place. 

" 'Felling' is hemming down an edge after seaming two edges together, 
leaving one above the other. Turn this down narrowly, pressing it with the 



DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 203 

fingers, and then give a second turning, which should be basted down. Finish 
by hemming the edge. 'Facing' is done by sewing a strip along the edge, 
turning it up and hemming down the remaining edge. To bind with a braid, 
the two edges of the latter are placed one on either side of the article to be 
bound, and then backstitched carefully in position. 

"To make a hem necessitates two turnings, as a raw edge is not hemmed. 
To measure a hem or tuck, take a piece of cardboard and mark off the correct 
width; by placing this against the material and marking the latter with a pin 
the correct turning is easily given. When the hem is basted place the needle 
in the single fabric at the doubled edge so that it takes a diagonal slant to the 
left and upward, coming out just above the doubled edge; then repeat, putting 
the needle a trifle in advance and beneath where it came out, thus leaving diag- 
onal stitches on each side of the sewing. A French hem is done by turning 
and basting the entire hem as usual, and then turning back this hem to the 
right side of the work and hemming as usual. 

"A rolled hem is usually found on ruffles. The edge is rolled between 
the left thumb and forefinger until the raw edge is completely hidden, and 
then hemmed. 

"Even gathers show a running stitch of the same size on both sides of 
the work as for narrow ruffling; the back of a skirt, though, will be gathered 
with the upper stitch twice as long as the under stitch. All gathers should 
have two rows of gathering threads, as this makes them set more evenly, 
whether they are an inch or a sixteenth of an inch apart; in each row the 
stitches must be the same in position and size. To gauge or stroke gathers, 
pull all of the fabric gathered up on a thread in a small space and fasten the 
thread over a pin; hold these firmly with the left hand and stroke down lightly 
the material beneath each stitch with a needle. This gives a beautiful even- 
ness, as each stitch is stroked and moved along until done, when the thread 
is loosened and the gathers stitched in place. 

"Shirring is simply several rows of gathering which are confined to a 
narrow space. 

"Puffing is formed by gathering and then sewing the lower row close 
up to the upper one, so as to form a puff between. In puffs and gathered ruf- 
fles made of thin materials a length once and a half as long as the space to be 
covered is allowed, while for silk or a heavier fabric once and a third is suf- 
ficient. Both of these quantities may be applied to lace, and it is commonly 
known that bias-cut ruffle, puff, or flounce of any kind sets better when gath- 
ered than a straight one, neither does it take as much material. 

"To whip on lace, basting is not necessary, as it will be well to have the 
slight fullness arising from holding the lace toward you. The whipping is 
simply overcasting the edge of a hem and the lace together. 

"Cording is a bias strip with a soft cord along the centre held by basting 
stitches until applied as a finish, when the close stitching is done close up to 
the cord. Piping is done in the same way, leaving the cord out. 

"On woolen goods use letter D silk twist for working buttonholes, and 
numbers forty or fifty thread on muslin, and sixty or even finer on thin cotton 
materials. Do not cut a buttonhole close to the edge; between a quarter and 
eighth of an inch is the usual allowance of the material between the end of 
the buttonhole and the edge of the fabric. Unless you are a practiced cutter 
you can hardly make a hole straight without the regular button hole scissors. 
Cut a hole that is a tight fit for the buttons, as working enlarges it. 

"After cutting run a fine cotton thread all around the hole to keep it in 



204 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 

shape, and in working take the stitches from you. Commence at one end, and 
let each stitch touch. Put the needle in the wrong side and bring it out right 
side of a sixteenth of an inch below the edge of the hole; as the thread is 
drawn up put the needle back in the loop, which gives the buttonhole edge a 
durable and ornamental finish. As the ends are rounded spread the stitches 
a trifle, and when done rub with a thimble on the wrong side to flatten the 
work. 

"Eyelets are worked in shirts, shirt-waists, evening bodices when laced 
in the back, etc., and are made like a buttonhole, except that they are round. 
Anyone able to embroider should make nice, even buttonholes, yet few women 
turn out really perfect examples. Experience and practice will accomplish 
much, and I advise working one each day until a perfect buttonhole is made. 

"The stitches variously known as herring-bone, feather, rail, cat, and 
coral are all first cousins, and are generally used on infants' wear, lingerie, 
children's guimpes, etc. 

"Smocking is beautiful handwork for yokes of children's frocks, blouses, 
dressing-sacques, and tea gowns, and is easy to accomplish. Smocking con- 
sists of laying small plaits by careful measurement, and then catching the 
edge of every two together with three overstitches, forming a tiny knot; then 
passing to the third plait, which is caught to the second one of the first two, 
leaving long, loose threads of silk beneath to secure the elastic appearance. 

"The next row of knots or catches fastens every alternate plait, thus 
forming a kind of honey-comb cell. The knots are often of a contrasting 
color of silk. 

"If a button has a metal shank, a hole must be pierced in the goods in 
which to run the shank; run a cord through and sew both cord and shank in 
place. If the button has holes to be sewed through, remember that the thread 
must not be pulled so tightly that the goods will be puckered beneath. Cross 
the threads as they come through the holes so that they form an X on the out- 
side of the button, using heavy thread like linen twist or silk twist. On a 
properly-made coat or jacket the buttons are sewed on before the lining is 
hemmed down. Small, braid-covered buttons require short stitches loosely 
drawn and tightly fastened." 

Neglect of the sewing machine is responsible for a deal of trouble to 
seamstresses, and the turning out of much unsatisfactory work. Every part 
of the machine should be kept thoroughly clean. See that it is well covered 
whenever the room is swept and at all times when not in use. Only the best 
quality of oil should be used, and it is well to apply the oil several hours before 
you sew. Then if the machine is wiped with a clean cloth just before using 
it there will be no oil to soil the garment you are making. 

DUST. 

DANGER. — The greatest danger from dust lies in the fact that it is 
almost universally accompanied by disease germs in large quantities, which 
are apt to become transferred to our bodies directly, or to our clothing or 
food, eventually securing a foothold in our system. This is especially so in 
cases of contagious or epidemic diseases. Poisons are often transferred in 
dust. Dust and dirt are always inviting to vermin and pests, as well as disease 
germs. 

PREVENTING. — In winter there is no greater cause of dust in the 
house than the cellar, as described under "Cellar" in this Department, for there

are kept the dirtier things of the house, and the ashes from the heater. This 
dust is sucked up by the hot air and distributed throughout the house. In 
summer the open windows are the greatest dust producers, and little can be 
done to prevent its entrance. Good screens will keep out a lot of dust, as 
well as insects. In sweeping, care should be taken to prevent the dust from 
rising. This can be done with damp tea leaves or sawdust, or with fresh-cut 
grass. 

REMOVING. — Dusting should be done only when there is a strong 
draught to the outside going through the room, and should be done with a 
brush before sweeping, and with a rag afterward. The dust rag should 
always be shaken outside. Clothes should be brushed and dusted outside 
as much as possible. Where it can be afforded, a vacuum duster should be 
used. Dust and sweepings of city houses should be burned or deposited so 
they will go into the sewage, as it is almost impossible to take them far 
enough away to prevent them from getting back or into someone's house. It 
is not possible to prevent all dust and dirt from getting into the home, so the 
best thing to do is to keep it removed in the most sanitary way. 

ECONOMIES. 

BUYING. — The home-maker who has studied her art will find that she 
can buy far less expensive material, whether foods, furnishings or clothing, if 
she has learned how to use them to the best advantage. She who must be 
careful of her pennies will often find that she can save by going to a little 
trouble in hunting out the proper persons to buy from, always keeping in 
mind the fact that in most instances "the best is the cheapest." This applies 
especially to articles of a more permanent nature, such as furnishings, clothing, 
and so forth; but is often equally true of foods, on account of the smaller waste 
in the higher priced articles. While the securing of bargains should not be 
overlooked, the general buying is most economically done by selecting reliable 
individual dealers who come to know your wants and who treat you well and 
deal with you on a high-grade business basis. 

FURNISHING. — The greatest economy in furnishing is to avoid over- 
doing it. Buy only what you have actual use for as utility or ornament. Over- 
furnishing spoils the effect in your home, is a useless waste of money, and 
makes so much more work to be done in keeping it clean. Purchase only such 
articles as are suitable to your station in life, but have them good, for good 
material is always economical, and a little of it makes a better appearance 
than a lot that is inferior. 

HEATING. — "Don't Waste" should be your motto if you wish to heat 
economically. To avoid waste means that you must see that your fire is kept 
clean, the heater or stove and all its pipes and parts are kept 
clean and in good order, that your fire is kept burning evenly, and that you 
study out the best fuel for your particular use and purchase it to the best ad- 
vantage. If the heating apparatus is not in good order the heat will waste in 
the cellar, walls and chimney. If the fire is not kept burning evenly the house 
will become overheated, and be opened to reduce the heat. Then it becomes 
chilled and must be heated again. The house should be carefully ventilated, 
but common sense will tell anyone that you cannot heat a house well if win- 
dows are left wide open. Heat rises, and if the air that feeds the heater is 
fresh, it will work to the top of the house or room, where there should be a

small opening through which it can escape so slowly that there will not be a 
rush of air through the house. Fire that is on top of dead ashes may burn, 
but it will not throw off near the heat that it will when clear below. It is very 
essential to have the water pan in the heater kept full, or a pan of water on the 
stove, as dry heat will not carry well, while damp heat may be delivered to a 
distant point. The matter of fuel depends upon the particular house and par- 
ticular heater or stove that it is wanted for, and also on the price of the dif- 
ferent fuels in your locality. Old papers, boxes and baskets, and scraps of 
wood, if saved during the summer, may be used to heat the house on the first 
cool days, and delay the starting of the winter fire. Try different sizes of 
coal, or a mixture of coal and coke, and decide which is the best. If the man 
is away all day, the larger sizes of hard coal will keep well and save the con- 
stant attention during the day that is necessary when small coal or coke are 
used. Gas and oil stoves are often economical where a limited space is all that 
heat is needed in. 

LIGHTING. — The saving of a few cents at the expense of eyesight is 
the poorest kind of an attempt at economy, and we therefore say that the first 
principle of economy in lighting is to have GOOD light. That does not neces- 
sarily mean a bright light, but one suitable for the work in hand. For reading 
cr sewing the light should be bright and steady and shine on your book or work 
from over the left shoulder, so that the eyes are shaded from the direct rays. 
General illumination and light for meals may be softened by pretty shades and 
a decreased consumption of oil or gas or electricity. Light for writing should 
be like that for reading, provided it is not strong enough or in such position to 
cause a glare on the paper. Probably most of our readers will use more gas 
than any other illuminant, and we wish to impress upon them the economy of 
using some sort of burner which has a mantle. These burners give brighter 
and steadier light, and save their cost in gas in a very short time. Adjust 
them so that the mantle is all white when lit and there is no roar of gas. 
Probably the most common cause of waste is the allowing lights to burn which 
are not needed. Do not go out of the room and leave the light burning 
brightly. It is easy to acquire the habit of saving light, and then you are on 
the safe side. 

LIVING. — The truest economy of living is not so much in doing without 
as it is in avoiding waste in what you have. This is another one of the thou- 
sand ways in which the good housewife proves herself entitled to the name, and 
is another cause for constant care and watchfulness. She must study to buy 
for the table so that no good food is wasted; she must see that clothing is 
kept in such condition that it looks and wears best; she must see that all the 
household furniture and furnishings are kept in good order, and that each part 
of the plan of home management dovetails in with all the rest. Throughout 
this entire book will be found helpful hints for economy in the household 
without the sacrifice of comfort, and the housewife can always devise special 
ways that fit her own case. 

ENTERTAINING. 

The proper entertainment of guests can only be determined by condi- 
tions. The treatment of a neighbor making a formal call will naturally be 
different from that of a relative on a visit, and the good judgment and natural 
tact of host or hostess must be relied upon. The most attractive hosts are 
those who are good listeners, allowing the guest to do most of the talking, but 



DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 209 

deftly finding subjects that are interesting to them and keeping the conversa- 
tion confined to them. Minister to the bodily comfort of your guests, and sub- 
serve your pleasure to theirs. "Small-talk" is sometimes necessary, but if 
possible guide the conversation onto current topics or some subject which will 
be interesting and improving. Such treatment will make your visitor hate to 
go, and will give them the impression that you are an excellent host, and a 
person of great judgment and high education, though you have done nothing 
but carefully guide the conversation. If refreshments are used at all, make 
them seem incidental. To make them prominent is considered vulgar. Whis- 
pering, muffled talk, or sly, knowing glances make the guests infer that they 
are the subject, or the communication would be open. This immediately makes 
them suspicious and the situation uncomfortable for them. 

FIRE 

TO PREVENT.— See Index. 

IN CASE OF.— See Index. 

FOR COOKING. — In Philadelphia there are very few houses which do 
not have gas in them, and this means of cooking is rapidly and deservedly 
becoming more and more used. This is particularly so since such improved 
and convenient and cheap gas ranges have come into the market. They are 
cheaper in fuel, too, where there is comparatively little cooking to do, as there 
is absolutely no expense except while actually cooking. Many housewives 
claim, however, that you cannot get the same results with certain dishes that 
can be had by using coal, and it is probable that most women can roast and 
bake better with coal, while for boiling or frying the gas range is considered 
better. In either case, both the fire and the stove should be kept clean. In a 
coal range, the soot and ashes should be removed frequently from above and 
below the oven, as heat for baking or roasting most foods should be severe and 
dry. 

FOR HEATING. — See "Heating" under the heading "Economies," in 
this Department. 

FLOORS. 

If the floors, or any part of them, are not to be covered, a little work at 
first will save a great deal of work later. First sweep the part which is to 
remain uncovered, and then scrub well. After it is thoroughly clean and dry, 
fill the cracks with putty of about the same color as the floor, or a little darker. 
Then get a wood filler and coat well once or twice until the pores of the wood 
are filled. After this is well dried, apply some liquid floor stain of the desired 
color. Unless the stain contains some hard gloss coating, a coat of shellack or 
spar varnish should be added. Floors treated in this way may be wiped up with a 
damp cloth very quickly and easily. If the floor is of hardwood, take out stains, 
if any, with ammonia, fill all parts bleached and coat with floor polish two or 
three coats. Then take pumice stone and oil and rub over the surface lightly. 
This may be kept in good condition by occasionally rubbing with furniture 
polish. The subject of carpets has been discussed under its own heading, but 
much may be said in favor of oil-cloth, linoleum and mattings. The better 
grades of linoleum wear very well and are excellent for kitchens or places that 
should be scrubbed often. Mattings collect less dust and are easy to clean. 
They make very desirable floor-coverings for bedrooms, with rugs over them, 
and are cool and refreshing in summer. 



210 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 

FLOWERS. 

Cut flowers should not be allowed to remain in bedrooms at night, as 
they throw off injurious gases. The condition of flowers may be kept up by 
cutting off the ends of the stems and changing the water frequently. Flowers 
with a heavy, pungent odor should not be kept in a sick room, as they are often 
oppressive to the patient. Cut flowers may be kept fresh and odorous for sev- 
eral days by wrapping the stems in a thin fringe of cotton batting that has 
been dipped in salt water and then rolling them in a strip of tinfoil. When not 
being worn, keep them with the stems in a glass of salt water in a cool room 
and cover the blossoms with tissue or oiled paper. Water in which mignonette 
has been placed should be changed often, for it quickly becomes foul. Do not 
mix heliotropes with other cut flowers in water. They decay very quickly and 
will harm the other blossoms. Cut flowers that have become wilted may be 
refreshed by clipping the ends and dipping the stems into hot water for a few 
minutes and then into cold. 

GAMES. 

In the best and happiest homes games and pastimes have their place. 
There can be no doubt that men and women are helped to happier and better 
lives by home amusements. The children who are permitted and encouraged 
to enjoy healthy and innocent games at home cling closer to their homes. They 
are not tempted to go elsewhere for the amusement for which Nature has given 
them the desire. 

The danger in driving children away from home for amusement is par- 
ticularly great in the case of boys. For boys whose home life represses every 
buoyant feeling and desire for fun and romping, the forces of evil are ever 
lying in wait. There are pitfalls and traps enough for boys at the best. Do not 
help to put them in the way of these perils by refusing them amusements at 
home. 

Parents, too, are better for joining in their children's games and pas- 
times. It lightens their cares; it helps to keep their brains clear for the larger 
duties of life, and tends to keep them young. Above all, participation in your 
children's sports keeps you in that close and intimate touch with their lives, 
their thoughts, and their aspirations in which the truest family relations are 
found, and to attain which far too many parents fail. You do not want your 
children to grow away from you. Do what you can to prevent this by giving 
them amusements at home and sharing the pleasure with them. Keep the 
home pastimes within proper bounds. Because these amusements are desirable 
and good, they must not be permitted to fill up an undue share of the home 
life. Every member of the family, young or old, should have duties to perform 
for himself and others, and with these the games must not be allowed to inter- 
fere. Studies must not be neglected for sports. Not until the day's lessons are 
learned and the day's duties done should the games appear. 

Other things being equal, outdoor games are preferable to indoor sports 
for their wider exercise in fresher air, but these are often out of the question, 
and, of course, are not to be thought of in the long evenings of winter. It is 
well not to entirely forget exercise in making up a program for an evening's 
gc.mes, but it need not be of the violent or too noisy kind. The familiar games 
of blind man's bluff, bean bags, battledoor and shuttlecock, parlor ring toss, 
grace hoops, and parlor tenpins are excellent for children and grown folks who 



DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 311 

have had little exercise. They give mind and body mild but stimulating and 
healthful activity, and are helpful after a rainy day which has kept everybody 
indoors. 

There are many pleasant home games in which parents and children 
may join, and which cannot be obtained at the toy stores. Some of them are 
given herewith: 

JENKINS UP. 

Divide the players into equal sides and seat them on opposite sides of 
a large table — the dining table is generally the best. One side takes a silver 
quarter or other coin, and all the players on that side hold their hands out of 
sight under the table. While the leader of the other side slowly counts ten the 
first side players pass the ccin quickly back and forth from hand to hand under 
the table, until at the end of the count the signal, "Jenkins says hands up," is 
given. Then all hands on the first side must be raised with fingers tightly 
closed and elbows resting on the table. Of course, one of the players will have 
the coin in his hand, but he must not betray the fact. At the signal from the 
opposite side, "Hands down," all drop their hands to the table, opening the 
fingers so that the hands rest flatly on their palms. The second side must now 
find the hand under which the coin is concealed. They agree upon a hand they 
believe does not conceal a coin, one hand at a time, until the coin is revealed, 
the object of the second side being to have the hand covering the coin the last 
one left upon the table. When the coin is revealed it is passed to the other 
side, which conceals it as the first one has done, and so on. The hands on the 
table when the coin is found count one each against the side which is hunting 
for it. The side loses which first has fifty hands scored against it. Each player 
keeps special watch on the player opposite, so as to catch any sign he may be- 
tray of having the coin. 

"IT." 
One of the players is sent cut cf the room, and the others place their 
chairs in a circle and agree that "It" shall be his or her left-hand neighbor. 
The outside player is then called in, and it is his duty to guess what "It" is. 
Stepping into the circle, he asks one of the players some questions about "It" 
which can and must be answered "Yes" or "No," and the player questioned 
must have his left-hand neighbor in mind when he answers. Questions are 
asked in turn of each player, going to the left around the circle. The questions 
and categorical answers are sure to make a lot of fun from the start, and are 
to be kept up until the one in the centre guesses what "It" is. 

CHARACTERISTICS. 
Write on slips of paper seven or eight questions, the answers to which, 
if truthfully given, should tend to bring out the player's characteristics. For 
example: "What is your favorite book?" "What is your idea of happiness?" 
"What do you think of matrimony?" Each player writes an answer to each 
of the questions. The answers are then read without giving the writer's name. 
The one who rightly guesses from the answers who wrote the larger number 
wins the game. 

EYES AND NOSE. 
Hang up in the doorway a sheet or large piece of paper and cut in it two 
holes for the eyes and one hole for the nose. Let one-half of the players be in 
front of the sheet and the others behind it. Each of the latter players steps up 



212 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 

and looks through the eyeholes, letting the nose appear through the hole cut 
for it. Those in front of the sheet are to guess who it is whose eyes and nose 
they see, being allowed one minute for observation. Then the players change 
sides, and those who first posed become the guessers. The side making the 
larger number of correct guesses is the winner. 

A variation of eyes and nose game is to place a lamp so that it casts 
shadows of the players' profiles or hands or entire heads, those in front to 
guess whom the shadows represent. 

MIXED FLOWERS. 
Select the name of ten well-known flowers and mix up the letters in each 
name, as "negumiar" for geranium," "sanpy" for pansy, etc. Write these mixed 
names on slips of paper, one for each player, and allow so many minutes to 
sort out and write the correct names of the flowers. The winner is the one 
having the longest correct list at the end of the contest. 

MEMORY. 

Place on a table in a room from which the players are excluded a col- 
lection of all sorts of things, small and large, and having no relation to each 
other. Call in the players, one at a time, and allow each one minute to look at 
the things on the table, without touching them. After all have seen the table 
distribute paper and pencils and allow five or ten minutes for the players to 
write down what they saw on the table. The one writing the longest correct 
list wins the game. 

FIVE SENSES. 

This is an enlargement of the memory game. Arrange one table as for 
Memory, and cover it with a cloth. On another table place various articles un- 
der a sheet, and on a third table tiny portions of articles to be eaten or drank. 
On still another table put various articles having more or less characteristic 
odors, such as vinegar, coffee, cologne, etc. These tables represent the senses 
of sight, touch, taste, and smell. The cloth is lifted from the first, and the 
players are allowed two minutes to look at the articles, as in the Memory 
game. On the second table the players have two minutes in which to feel of 
the objects under the covering. At the third table a taste of each article is 
taken, and at the fourth table one good "sniff" of each article. Then a person 
behind a screen strikes twice on each of various musical instruments, dishes, 
glasses and other articles which have distinctive tones. After this the players 
are given slips of paper and pencils and allowed ten or fifteen minutes to write 
out what they saw, felt, tasted, smelled, and heard. The longest correct list, 
counting all senses, wins the game. 

CANDLE DUEL. 
Blindfold two players, but have the handkerchiefs thin enough so that 
the wearers can see the glimmer of a lighted candle, which must be carried in 
the left hand, while the right hand must be held behind the back. Turn the 
lights low and let the contestants try to blow out each other's candle. The first 
one succeeding is the winner. Only the larger children or adults should try 
this game, for it is too much like "playing with fire" for the little ones. 

HUNT THE PENNY. 
With a sharp knife "nick" a copper cent so that a tiny point will stick up 
from its face. Press this against the dark wood of any article of furniture, 



DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 21* 

mantlepiece, or the like, in plain sight, and then call in the player to find it. 
Like the white paper around the candle, it is not so easy as one might think to 
find. 

GEOGRAPHY. 
Two persons must be in the secret to play this game. One of them is 
sent out of the room, and the others choose the name of some city or State, 
river or mountain. The outsider is then called in, and the second player who 
understands the game asks him questions as to what has been chosen. Sup- 
pose it is Chicago. "Is it New York?" the player will ask, and the answer will 
be "No" very promptly. "Is it Buffalo?" "No" will be the answer. "Is it Chi- 
cago?" and, to the astonishment of the others, the answer will be "Yes" at 
once. The explanation is that just before asking the question which will give 
the right name the questioner mentions an animal. In this case "Buffalo" gave 
the outsider notice that the next name mentioned would be the chosen one. 

GLOVES. 

CLEANING. — Rub with very slightly dampened bread crumbs. If not 
effectual, scrape upon them dry fullers earth, or French chalk, when on the 
hands, and rub them quickly together in all directions. Do this several times. 
Or put gloves cf a light color on the hands, and wash the hands in a basin of 
spirits of hartshorn. Seme gloves may be washed in a strong lather made of 
white soap and warm water, cr milk, or wash with rice pulp. Or sponge them 
well with turpentine. 

HOUSEKEEPING ADVANTAGES. 

The greatest advantage to be derived from housekeeping is the privacy 
and home life that is not possible in any other condition of living. If it is in 
any way possible all the newly-married people should keep house, at least for 
the first few years. It is the family community that teaches the sacred ties of 
home which engender a home love that nothing can destroy, and which will 
withstand all the temptations and allurements of the world. To those who 
work together in establishing and keeping their heme, it becomes dearer and 
dearer as the years roll by and is to all of the family the grandest and most at- 
tractive place in the world. There may be circumstances where it cannot be 
done, but where it is possible we strongly advise the young folks to start their 
own home, even if it must be done in a very modest way. In fact, the happiest 
homes are usually those which started with little and have been gradually 
equipped and perfected by the labors and love and co-working of man and wife 
together. In far the majority of cases it is advisable to be alone, no matter 
how dear the parents of either may be, for some slight discord will almost in- 
variably creep in and lead to less pleasant relations than if each were masters 
and mistresses of their own domicile. Then, too, it brings out the individuality 
and initiative of the young people and keeps them from always depending on 
someone else. The economy cf housekeeping depends on many things. For 
those of true economical nature it is cheaper than boarding, but for those who 
are not willing to do the best they can with what they have, and be contented, 
or those who must attempt to equal others more fortunate than themselves in 
the matter of wealth, it had best not be undertaken. One of the greatest canker 
sores in the American home today is the tendency to ape those who are better 
off. The Sheriff gets a lot of his work from this source, and happiness is de- 



214 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 

stroyed by it whenever it gets hold of a victim. Those whose approbation is 
worth having will always have respect for people who make no pretenses, but 
live happily within their means, while they have contempt for those who try to 
make themselves appear to be what they are not. Some people think they can 
deceive others by appearances, but they seldom do. Keep your heme neat and 
tidy, and always improve it so that as you become better off you naturally drift 
into your rightful place in the higher walks of life and look down upon those 
who tried to accomplish the climb by masquerading. For the training of chil- 
dren, housekeeping is the only proper atmosphere, as there they are under 
your own influence, instead of being affected by strangers of varying type. Do 
more than keep house, make a home, be kind, courteous and generous in the 
home, and always do your best there, for the opinion of strangers should be of 
less consequence to you than the opinion of those you love. 

HOUSEKEEPING HINTS. 

TO CLEAN GILT FRAMES.— When the gilt frames of pictures or 
looking glasses, cr the gilt mouldings of rooms have dirt specks upon them, 
from flies or other causes, they can be cleaned with the white of an egg gently 
rubbed on with a camel's-hair pencil. 

TO CLEAN HAIR BRUSHES.— Dissolve a piece of soda in some hot 
water, allowing a piece the size of a walnut to a quart of water; put the water 
into a basin, and, after combing out the hair from the brushes, dip them, bristles 
downward, into the water and out again, keeping the backs and handles as free 
from water as possible. Repeat this until the bristles look clean; then rinse 
the brushes in a little cold water; shake them well, and wipe the handles and 
backs with a towel, but not the bristles, and set the brushes to dry in the sun, 
or near the fire. Wiping the bristles of a brush makes them soft, as does also 
the use of soap. 

TO CLEAN JEWELRY.— Mix and keep corked, aqua ammonia, 1 oz., 
and one-eighth of an ounce of prepared chalk. 

To use for rings, or other smooth-surfaced jewelry, wet a bit of cloth 
with the compound, after having shaken it, and rub the article thoroughly; then 
polish by rubbing with a silk handkerchief or piece of soft buckskin. For arti- 
cles which are rough-surfaced, use a suitable brush. It is applicable for gold, 
silver, brass, britannia, plated goods, etc. 

TO CLEAN LEATHER.— Uncolored leather may be cleaned by apply- 
ing a solution of oxalic acid with a sponge. Dissolve in warm water. 

TO CLEAN MARBLE.— Use three ounces of pearl ash, one pound of 
whiting, and three pints of water well mixed together, and boil for ten min- 
utes; rub it well over the marble and let it remain twenty-four hours; then 
rub it off, and dry with clean cloth. 

TO DRIVE MOTHS FROM FURNITURE.— Moths may be extermin- 
ated or driven from upholstered work by sprinkling it with benzine. The 
benzine is put in a large watering-pot, such as is used for sprinkling house 
plants; it does not spot the most delicate silk, and the unpleasant odor passes 
off in an hour or two in the air. Care must be used not to carry on this work 
near a fire or flame, as the vapor of benzine is very inflammable. It is said 
that a little spirits of turpentine added to the water with which floors are 
washed will prevent the ravages of moths. 



DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 215 

TO MAKE HOUSEHOLD CEMENT.— A durable cement is made by 
burning oyster shells and pulverizing the lime from them very fine; then mix- 
ing it with white of egg to a thick paste and applying it to the china or glass, 
and securing the pieces together until dry. When it is dry, it takes a very 
long soaking for it to become soft again. Common lime will do, but it is not 
so good; either should be fresh burned, and only mix what is needed, for when 
once dry you cannot soften it. 

TO MAKE MUCILAGE. — An excellent mucilage may be made by 
taking one ounce of gum arabic, as much corrosive sublimate as will lay on 
a silver ten-cent piece; put it into a jar and pour over it one quart of cold, soft 
water; let it stand twenty-four hours, then stir, and it is ready for use, and it 
will keep as long a time as is desired. 

TO MAKE SILVER POLISH.— Cream of tartar, two ounces; prepared 
chalk, two ounces; pulverized alum, one ounce. Water sufficient to make a 
paste. Apply with soft cloth, allow to dry and polish with flannel. 

TO PREVENT RUST.— Melt and strain, while hot, two ounces of tal- 
low and one ounce of resin. 

Apply a light coat of this and you can lay away any articles not in con- 
stant use for any length of time, such as knives and forks, or mechanics' tools 
which are being laid by, or much exposed. But for axes or other new tools, 
which are exposed to the air before sold, you will find the following varnish 
preferable: 

One gallon of best alcohol, two pounds of gum sandarach, one-half pound 
of gum mastic. Place all in a tin can which admits of being corked; cork it 
tight, and shake it frequently, occasionally placing the can in hot water. When 
dissolved it is ready for use. 

TO PURIFY SINKS AND DRAINS.— To one pound of common cop- 
peras add one gallon of boiling water, and use when dissolved. The copperas 
is deadly poison and should always be carefully labeled if kept on hand. This 
is one of the best possible cleaners of pipes and drains. 

TO PURIFY WATER.— Put into it powdered charcoal, then filter 
through a compressed sponge, and it will become perfectly sweet, however 
impure previously. 

Water may be filtered and purified by means of a deep flower pot, with 
a compressed sponge in the hole at the bottom. Put over the sponge an inch 
thick of pebbles, next an inch of coarse sand, next a layer of charcoal, and 
over again pebbles. The water will filter pure and clear through the hole into 
another vessel. 

TO REMOVE IRON RUST.— Try salts of lemon. Buy it from your 
druggist and keep it out of the children's way. Wet the stains, rub in the 
salts of lemon and lay goods in the hot sun. If the first application does not 
entirely remove the iron mold, renew it, always leaving in the sunlight for 
some time. 

TO REMOVE MILDEW.— Soap the linen previously wetted, and apply 
salt and lemon juice to both sides, or apply finely powdered pipe clay, or 
fuller's earth, or finely powdered chalk. Expose it for several hours to the 
atmosphere. 

TO REMOVE ODORS.— Sprinkle chloride of lime, or burnt coffee is 
a good disinfectant, and it is very agreeable. For water closets, night chairs, 



216 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 

etc., chloride of lime and even common lime should be used. Or one ounce 
of sugar of lead, one ounce of aqua fortis, in nearly one quart of water. This 
is effectual to cleanse utensils from bad odors. Or charcoal powder and cam- 
phor dissolved, the articles well-rinsed with the composition. 

TO REMOVE STAINS.— If you have been picking or handling any 
acid fruit, and have stained your hands, wash them in clean water, wipe them 
lightly, and while they are still moist, strike a match and shut your hands 
around it so as to catch the smoke and the stains will disappear. Before fruit 
juice dries, it can often be removed by cold water, using a sponge and towel 
if necessary. Rubbing the fingers with the inside of the parings of apples will 
remove most of the stain caused by paring. If you have stained your muslin 
or gingham dress or your white pants with berries, before wetting them with 
anything else, pour boiling water through the stains and they will disappear. 
Ink, also, if washed out or sopped up from the carpet immediately when it is 
spilled, can be almost entirely removed. Ink spots on floors can be extracted 
by scouring with sand, wetted in oil of vitriol and water. When the ink is re- 
moved, rinse with strong pearl ash water. 

TO REMOVE TIGHT RING.— Envelop the finger in a length of flat 
rubber braid, beginning at the tip of the finger and laying it on closely and 
tightly, so as to exert its elastic force gradually and gently upon the tissues. 
When the binding is completed, the hand should be held up and in a few min- 
utes the swelling will be perceptibly diminished. The braid is then taken cff 
and immediately reapplied in the same manner, when, after another five min- 
utes, the finger, if again rapidly uncovered, will be small enough for the ring 
to be removed with ease. 

TO CLEAN GREASY TIN OR IRON.— Pour a few drops of ammonia 
into every greasy roasting pan after half filling the pan with warm water. A 
bottle of ammonia should always be kept on hand near the sink fcr such uses; 
never allow the pans to stand and dry, for it doubles the labor of washing, but 
pour in water and use the ammonia, and the work is half done. 

HOUSE PLANTS. 

No room in the house should be without its flower or growing plant. 
They do as much as any other thing to brighten the home and its surround- 
ings. And there is not a home in the land so poor that it cannot have a flower 
or plant. A great deal of useful information may be had from books on flori- 
culture, but an ounce of practical experience with the growing flowers in the 
house and garden is worth several pounds of book instruction. Each plant and 
flower has its own peculiarities, and must be carefully studied. Of two flowers 
of the same family one will thrive best in the hottest sun, and the other needs 
only half as much bright light. One will need a great deal of water and the 
other only a little. If raised in the house, one will require a small, but deep 
pot and the other a broad and shallow one. Success in flower growing de- 
pends upon finding out what treatment your plants call for and seeing that 
they get it. 

While all flowers and plants need air and light, there are numerous hand- 
some varieties which do not demand strong sunlight, and it is not necessary 
to confine your indoor plants to rooms open to the sun. You may have as at- 
tractive an indoor garden around a sunless window as where the sun shines 
brightly. The length and width of boxes for a window garden must depend

upon the size of the window. Let them be as long and as wide as the sill 
will allow. They should be from eight to ten inches deep. Shallow boxes 
do not give root room for deep-growing plants. Consult your own taste as to 
the material for the boxes, remembering that flowers will flourish as luxuriant- 
ly in a box made out of cheap pine boards as in a costly box of hard wood or 
tile. Many florists consider wooden boxes preferable. Bore small holes in the 
ends, near the bottom, for drainage purposes. If of wood, paint the boxes to 
harmonize with the woodwork and wall covering of the room. Elaborate 
decoration is not necessary. It will be covered up by the much prettier decora- 
tion of the plants themselves. 

Do not fasten flower boxes to window or wall. Let them rest on the 
sill and firm brackets or stands. You should be able to easily lift and turn 
them or shift their position to another window. Many persons do not plant 
flowers directly in the boxes, but keep them in pots set in the boxes. 
This enables an easy arrangement of flowers or plants whenever desirable, 
and permits turning any one without all the others in the box. Most flowering 
plants grown in the house need to be turned occasionally to insure symmetri- 
cal growth. In reaching toward the light they will grow out of shape if left 
too long in one position. 

All flowers planted in the same box must have practically the same treat- 
ment, no matter what may be best for each individual plant. In watering, espe- 
cially, all must share alike, though one plant may not need nearly as much 
moisture as its neighbor. Where pots are used this difficulty is entirely 
avoided. Let the soil for all your plants be rich and light. Bonemeal makes 
an excellent fertilizer for poor soil in boxes or pots. The earth should not 
harden into cakes after watering. If it does, put in enough coarse sand to 
lighten it. The bottom of the box should have a layer of coarsely-broken char- 
coal to serve as a foundation for the soil and to assist in drainage. 

If you decide to plant in boxes, be careful to select for each box such 
varieties as require about the same condition of soil, light, and moisture. 
Plants calling for strong sunlight should not be placed in the same box with 
those thriving best in half-light, nor should flowers requiring a great deal of 
water be in the same box with those needing a dry soil. 

The box on the window-sill is the simplest form of the indoor flower 
garden. It is the foundation for a floral bower that may be arranged in the 
countless number of pretty and effective designs, just as your taste and fancy 
may dictate. Brackets and swinging shelves on each side of the window may 
carry flowers, plants, or vines trained in any way you wish. Trellis work may 
be carried all around the window, on either side, or simply overhead, rounded, 
pointed, arched, and squared, covered with running vines. Hanging baskets 
may be suspended from top or sides to help complete a charming floral picture. 
If the window is large, a shelf for plants may be run across the centre, from 
side to side, without shutting out too much light. One of the greatest pleas- 
ures in raising flowers in the house is in designing artistic window gardens and 
in arranging each plant so that it shall do its full share in adding to the beauty 
of the whole. Individual taste, too, must select the flowers, plants, and vines 
to be used. Sun-loving plants cannot be expected to do well in windows where 
the sun does not enter, nor can flowers which droop in bright sunlight be suc- 
cessfully used if placed where the sun pours upon them. If your indoor garden 
is in a window having a southern exposure, roses, geraniums, heliotropes, 
fuchsias, and similar flowers will rarely fail to give good results. In general, 
all high-colored flowers are suitable for a sunny window garden. 



DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 219 

For a garden in a shady window primroses, hyacinths, calla lilies, white 
azaleas, and begonias are some of the flowers most likely to be successful. 
Nearly all varieties of ferns thrive in a sunless window, and most of the palms 
and common rubber plants do well in such a garden. 

Nasturtium, asparagus, and smilax are effective running vines for win- 
dow gardens. Beautiful borders for window boxes can be had by planting 
sweet alyssum and mignonette. Acorns planted in wet moss in a shallow dish 
are very decorative. They need plenty of warmth and grow very rapidly. 

Saxifrage, moneymusk, and othonna are excellent plants for hanging 
baskets. A coarse sponge, dampened and sprinkled thickly with flax, mustard, 
or clover seed, will become a very pretty hanging garden if suspended by a 
string in the window. 

Bulbs for flowers for the winter window garden should be planted in 
September or early in October. This will bring them into blossom for the 
Christmas holidays. The Easter lily and the freesia should be potted in Au- 
gust. See that the soil is rich. Give it a thorough watering after planting the 
bulb, and set the pot away in a dark closet or in a dark place in the cellar, and 
let it alone for six or eight weeks, except to give it a little water if the room 
in which it is kept is very dry. The bulb must be thoroughly rooted before 
the plant is brought to the light. Freesias, hyacinths, narcissus, and daffodils 
are easy bulbs to grow. 

Plants raised from seed are likely to be fully as vigorous as those from 
cuttings, and are much more likely to be free from disease. Some of the best 
flowers for the home in winter, raised from seed, are the sweet alyssum, mig- 
nonette, dianthus, stocks, and primrose. Flowers from cuttings that may be 
best raised for the winter window garden are verbenas, carnations, geraniums, 
roses, heliotropes, lantanas, ageratums, and coleus. To root these plants place 
the tender ends of the branches in sand and keep the sand well moistened. 
After they have rooted cut the tips and place the new plant in a pot filled with 
good, rich soil. As the plants grow keep them well pruned back to give them 
shapely forms and induce a strong new growth. 

In a general way what has been said of the indoor garden applies equally 
to the outdoor window garden — the only outdoor garden that many dwellers 
in the city can have. There is the same opportunity for the judicious selection 
of plants and flowers, with a much longer list of flowers in summer than in 
winter from which to make your choice, and the same chance for plain or elab- 
orate designs, with the window box as the base. 

In most large cities the great majority of dwellings have only small back 
yards available for flower-raising, and these are often so very small that there 
is really no room for a flower bed. Yet even in these restricted spaces a little 
care and ingenuity will bring about astonishing results. A small tub containing 
some quick-growing vine placed on top of the post which holds up the clothes- 
line will turn the post into a thing of beauty. Running vines planted at the 
foot of a post will add to its attractiveness. Tall flowers, like hollyhocks and 
sunflowers, can be planted close to the fence, where they will please the eye 
without taking up needed room. Barrel hoops may be fastened to the fence 
in such a way as to make, when covered with vines, a canopy under which a 
seat may be placed in pleasant weather. By planting tall flowers near the 
fence, medium growers just in front of these, and smaller plants in front of the 
latter, you can get the effect of a large surface of flowers with only a few inches 
of actual space taken up in the yard. 



220 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 

Scores of other effective ways of utilizing the small back yards in beauti- 
fying your surroundings will be sure to suggest themselves if you will give the 
matter a little study. Do not neglect the back yard. The view from the rear 
windows of a home in a city block is not apt to be inviting at its best. You 
can do much to make it attractive by making a garden of your back yard, and 
in thus giving pleasure to yourself you are also giving pleasure to your neigh- 
bors whose windows look out on your yard. Often, too, your back yard garden 
will induce your neighbors to improve their yards, so that the whole interior 
of a block may be made beautiful and the pleasures of home life enhanced. 

One of the most frequent causes of failure in raising flowers in the home 
is improper watering of the plants. The most common mistake is to give too 
little water. While plants differ greatly in the amount of moisture they re- 
quire, it is easier to give them too little than too much. It is not enough to 
merely moisten the surface of soil in box or pot. The earth should be saturat- 
ed all through, so that the lowest root of the plant may get its share. Do not 
let the soil harden or "cake" after watering. It should be kept loose. If the 
plant is one having a mass of roots, run a stiff wire through the earth two or 
three times before watering, so as to form little channels for the water to pene- 
trate the mass. Do not try to water plants by putting water in saucers to be 
drawn up from the bottom of the pot. The plant will get very little of it, for 
most of the water will evaporate. Do not water the roots alone. The leaves 
cf a plant and the petals of a flower need water as much as the roots. Dust 
and dirt clog the pores of leaves and prevent the plant from getting the most 
good from the air and moisture. Sprinkle the leaves and petals well every 
time you water the plant. The under side of leaves should also be occasionally 
moistened. This can be done with a gardener's syringe. In the case of plants 
with large leaves it will pay to lightly wash the leaves with a wet sponge. In 
watering house plants use water of the same temperature as the room in which 
they are kept. Rain water is the best. Spring water should not be used unless 
it has been exposed to the sun several days in shallow vessels. 

IRONING. 

PREPARING STARCH.— Take two tablespoonfuls of starch dissolved 
in as much water; add a gill cf cold water; then add one pint of boiling water, 
and bcil it half an hcur, adding a small piece of spermaceti, sugar or salt, 
strain, etc. Thin it with water. 

STARCHING. — Muslins look well when starched, dried while the starch 
is hot, then folded in a damp cloth till they become quite damp before ironing 
them. 

SPRINKLING. — Clothes should be sprinkled with clear water, and laid 
in separate piles; one of flannels, one of colored, one cf common and cne of fine 
articles. 

FOLDING. — Fold the fine articles and roll them in a towel, and then 
fold the rest, turning them all right side outward. Lay the colored articles 
separate from the rest. They should not remain damp long, as the colors 
might be injured. Sheets and table linen should be shaken and folded. 

IRONING. — In ironing a shirt, first do the back, then the sleeves, then 
the collar and bosom and then the front. Iron calicoes generally on the right 
side, as they thus keep clean for a longer time. In ironing a dress, first do 
the waist, then the sleeves, then the skirt, unless a skirt-board be used. Silk

should be ironed on the wrong side, when quite damp, with an iron which is 
not very hot; light colors are apt to change and fade. In ironing velvet, turn 
up the face of the iron, and after dampening the wrong side of the velvet, draw 
it over the face of the iron, holding it straight; always iron lace and needlework 
on the wrong side, and carry them away as soon as they are dry. 

KITCHEN. 

CARE. — This important duty should never be left entirely to the help. 
We have heard women boast that they never went near their kitchen, and have 
seen the kitchens and realized that if they did go into them they would not 
care to eat what came out of them. If you hire help, keep a watchful eye over 
the condition and care of the kitchen, and if you do your own work, do not 
spare any time or trouble necessary to keep it in perfect condition. In the 
kitchen someone must spend a large portion of their time, and it should be as 
pleasant a room as possible. It should be particularly clean, for here our food 
is prepared and all its ingredients are exposed to any dirt or germs which may 
be around. The room should be particularly well ventilated, so that the air 
may be kept pure and fresh and no odors allowed to pass through the house. 
It should be ventilated in a scientific manner so that no chilling drafts strike 
on the stove or the food in process of cooking. Kitchen walls should be wiped 
down frequently, as the grease and steam that is necessarily in the air forms 
a coating on the walls that collects dust and germs. 

DEVICES. — So much of the household work is done in the kitchen that 
it should be equipped with all the sanitary and labor-saving devices possible. 
This does not necessarily mean any great outlay of money, as much can be 
made by any one a little handy with tools. There should be a draining board 
attached to the sink, with grooves in it leading to the sink. This may be made 
of any kind of wood or metal and covered with oil-cloth, but is better made of 
maple and attached in such a way that it may be readily removed and scrubbed. 
There are many kitchen tables and cabinets on the market, which come fitted 
with numerous slides, drawers and compartments, but these may be replaced by 
making additional sub-divisions of what furniture you have. One of the most 
useful articles of kitchen furniture is a single table covered with zinc and with 
a turned-up edge three-quarters of an inch high. On this may be done all work 
that causes any slop or wet, and it may be wiped up and kept clean very easily. 
The equipment of the kitchen in utensils is dependent on the purse and re- 
quirements of the individual, but do not buy a lot of things that you will seldom 
need, for they must be constantly cleaned. Aluminum cooking utensils are 
very convenient, and save time in cooking. They cost more in the first place, 
but usually outlast the others if well cared for. Enough equipment should be 
bought or made to have a definite place for everything, and it should be kept 
there. Have a plenty of clean covers so that foods need not be long exposed. 

REFERENCE. — Every kitchen should be equipped with a good clock, a 
calendar and a sand-glass for timing short cooking. This book should always 
be kept ready to your hand, as you will find after using it a while that there will 
be dozens of times during a day that you will find the information of value, and 
you can turn to it in a minute, while months were consumed in getting it in 
form for you. Good, complete cook books are also useful to those who work 
by such guides, but we strongly advise the housewives to develop originality 
in her food preparations and make viands of her own.

The Imperial Kitchen Elevator 

was planned with one object in view: that of cutting down the 
hard, wearisome, never-ending daily labor of the housewife. 




The Old Way 

You know the feeling of depres- 
sion, the utter weariness, the back- 
ache, the premature old age, and 
even serious illness which may be 
laid directly to the cellar stairs. 

The average housewife, in pre- 
paring the meals of a single year, 
walks 61 miles — mainly up and 
down stairs. The time she spends 
in doing it is over 5 weeks out of 
the 52. She carries in her hands 
over 7 tons, and makes from 6,000 
to 10,000 trips to the cellar every 
year. 



'pHE Imperial Kit- 
chen Elevator is an 
invention which en- 
ables you to remove 
your refrigerator, kit- 
chen cabinet, cup- 
board and breadbox 
out of your crowded 
kitchen. It enables 
you to keep them and 
their contents in the 
coolness of the cellar, 
and have them all 
right back in the kit- 
chen in an instant. 
Ice bills are cut in 
half; fruits are pre- 
served from decay, 
and all other foods 
kept from spoiling 
both during the hot 
days of summer and 
in the winter heat of 
the kitchen. 




The Imperial Way 
Everything for the preparation 
of the meal is kept in one place. 
A touch of a push button, and 
the place comes to you ; no steps 
whatever, no cellar stairs to climb. 
A gentle push sends the elevator 
and its contents out of the kitchen 
during the heat of cooking and out 
of the way during the cleaning up. 
If your ice-box or cupboard is in 
the cellar, the Imperial Kitchen 
Elevator cuts out your many weary 
journeys down and up the cellar 
stairs. 

The Imperial Kitchen Elevator 
is a space-saver, a time-saver ; an 
additional servant in the house. 



Not to be Confused with a Dumbwaiter 

Do not confuse an Imperial Kitchen Elevator with a dumbwaiter. Its construc- 
tion is as different as its purpose. Both travel from floor to floor, but all resemblance 
stops there. There is no complicated mechanism to get out of order about the 
Imperial. Nothing to prevent its smooth working all the time — it never sticks or 
jams. It is out of sight and out of mind until wanted. Any handy man can install 
it in any home.

LIBRARY. 

An easy and common mistake is to START the library wrong. No mat- 
ter how small the start, the books should be only good ones both in subject and 
author, and also in binding and print. No more books should be bought than 
you have proper facilities for taking care of. Of course, there will be certain 
young couples whose interests centre in particular subjects, and this will be 
plainly shown in their library, but generally speaking, the library should cover 
as broad a field as possible so that the education you get from them will be 
general and well balanced. Good fiction has great value and is interesting, and 
a certain portion of it should be in the library, but it should not exclude others 
that are just as important. You should have seme history, particularly of your 
own country. Some histories are just as fascinating as fiction. Biographies of 
great men are very instructive as to customs and manners of the times in 
which they lived. Stories of travel, adventure, exploration and geographical 
research that are interesting as well as instructive should be included. Poetry 
should also have its place, for though not so popular now as it was a few 
years ago, it is the great refiner of language and expression and thought. Read 
only the poems of master poets if limited to a few. Books of science should 
not be neglected, and a good dictionary and encyclopedia should be on hand for 
reference when questions come up on which information is lacking. Whatever 
your selection or the quantity of books you may have, never forget that 
NO UNUSED BOOK IS VALUABLE, for it is only by absorbing the knowl- 
edge that we gain from reading, and applying it in our lives, that they are of 
any service to us. 

MATCHES. 
These always useful articles are extremely cheap, and unless your home 
is equipped with gas lighters or electricity, they should be in an accessible 
place in every room. Care must be taken, however, to make them inaccessible 
to children and also to mice or rats. Match safes hung on a wall away from 
anything on which mice can travel, and high enough to be out of the reach 
of children, will be, indeed, what their name says. Safety matches are better 
for household use, for, while short and quick-burning, they burn long enough to 
answer for most purposes. 

MATTING. 
This style of floor-covering is cheaper, cooler and cleaner than carpet, 
but naturally does not wear so well. Being of an open texture, it must be taken 
up frequently, and the floor under it well cleaned. 

MOTHS. 

Take one ounce of Tonquin beans, caraway seed, cloves, mace, nutmeg, 
cinnamon, well ground; add six ounces of Florentine orris root; mix well, and 
put in bags among your clothes. 

MUSIC IN THE HOME. 

This is one of the great home-making influences, and should be encour- 
aged, as, unless abused, its influence is decidedly for good. Good music appeals 
to and brings out the artistic and finer characteristics of our nature, it is cheer- 
ful and inspiring, it is restful and soothing, and its expense is usually returned 
with big interest in the influence it brings into the home. It helps to make the

home more attractive for the ladies as well as the men and children. What 
prettier sight than a happy family having a little concert of their own, with 
each taking some part, even if unimportant! Popular music is usually catchy 
and inspiring, and is of good value when cares bear you down and some re- 
action is necessary to restore your natural balance, but this should not be 
allowed to exclude the masters or the classic, which appeal more to the senti- 
ments and deeper feelings. Vocal music may always be had, and is the natural 
method of showing joy. Instrumental music is to be encouraged, too, for it 
adds greatly to the value of the vocal when rendered together, and may be had 
when voices are out of order, or singers are tired. Some persons cannot render 
music, but all enjoy it, and players seldom find it an effort, but usually restful. 

OIL CLOTH. 

We should never forget that this is merely cloth that has been filled, 
painted and varnished, and that it must have the same care and treatment as 
any other painted surface. Heat will blister it, acid will ruin it, sharp bending 
will break it, and liquids that will remove paint will remove it. Do not scrub it 
too frequently with strong soap and hot water. Never use benzine, gasoline, 
alcohol or naphtha to clean it; never allow wet soap to stand on it. The 
proper way to clean it is to wash the dirt off with cool, soft water and then 
rub and polish it with a woolen cloth. 

OLEOMARGARINE. 

The greatest objection to this product is the deception practiced in 
selling it as butter, for in itself it is not bad tasting or injurious. It is made 
under license and inspection, and is usually pure and wholesome, and very 
useful and economical as a substitute for butter in cooking. If you are sus- 
picious that it is being sold you as butter, melt a little of it in a saucer, and, 
while in an oily state, set fire to it and then blow it out quickly. If it is butter 
it will exude the odor of butter while cooking, but if oleo it will smell like 
a tallow candle which has just been blown out. 

PAINT CLEANING. 

Use little water at once; keep it warm and clean by changing it often. 
A flannel cloth takes off fly specks better than cotton. Soap will remove the 
paint, so use but little of it. Cold tea is the best liquid for cleaning varnished 
paint, window panes and mirrors. A saucer of wood ashes should always 
be standing at hand to clean unvarnished paint that has become badly smoked; 
it is better than soap. Never put soap upon glass unless it can be thoroughly 
rinsed off, which can never be done to window glass. Wash off the specks 
with warm tea, and rub the panes dry; then make a paste of whiting and water, 
and put a little in the centre of each pane. Take a dry cloth and rub it all 
over the glass; then rub it off with a chamois skin or flannel, and your glasses 
will shine like crystal. 

PANTRY. 

Not all houses are equipped with a separate room designated by this 
name, but in every home there must be some place that is used as such. This 
is where the food supply is kept, and the refrigerator is located here. Perfect 
cleanliness is the great thing here. Not only must all foreign matter, dust and

dirt be removed, but no spoiled or spoiling foodstuffs should be allowed to 
remain. When portions of food are left over place them in another dish of 
suitable size, as the scattered portions become bad very quickly. Keep all 
foods cool, and unless perfectly dry, keep them covered. If supplies are pur- 
chased in quantity and used slowly, move what is on hand occasionally, so 
that dust cannot accumulate. See that there is good ventilation. The refrig- 
erator calls for especial care, as here are the foods which spoil first and evap- 
orate most readily. Dry, unslacked lime in saucers is an excellent purifier 
of such places. Wipe off the outside of jars, cans and jugs occasionally with 
a cloth dampened in a mild solution of limewater, or chlorides. Never allow 
brooms, mops, clothing, dusters, or any articles exposed to contamination to 
remain in the same place as your foods. Keep the pantry as dry as possible. 

PARLOR. 

The old-fashioned parlor, with its closed and dignified air, is fast giving 
way to a cheerful living-room style which is more sensible, more economical, 
and more healthy. When room is scarce, none should be wasted, and there 
should be no unused rooms to be cared for. 

Nowadays, the guest who is shown into a formal parlor feels ill at 
ease, while the living room gives forth a cheerful welcome. For the average 
person, this room should contain the piano, and be the music room. The 
furnishings and decorations have been briefly discussed under the heading 
"Decorations" in this department. 

PETS. 

BIRDS IN THE HOME.— First in the list of song birds for pets in the 
home stands the canary. Few pets give more pleasure than this sweet singer. 
Canaries are at home in a cage, and the pleasure of listening to their song is 
not marred by the thought that they are pining for freedom. 

Most of the canaries sold in this country come from Germany or Eng- 
land. Much the larger number are bred in the Hartz Mountains in Germany. 
The English canary has the advantage of the German bird in size and bright 
color, but its song is louder and harsher, and the variety of its notes less than 
in the German bird. 

The St. Andreasberg canary, so-called because it is bred in the village 
of St. Andreasberg, in the Hartz Mountains, is generally regarded as the best 
singer. Great care is taken in mating birds of good voices only and in the 
training of voices. The musical education of the canary begins when he has 
finished his first molting, or when about twelve weeks old. With others of his 
age the bird is placed in a room out of hearing of all other singing canaries. 
In the ceiling of this room is a small opening, and in the room above is kept 
a fine European nightingale or skylark, or some other excellent whistling bird. 
From this unseen instructor the young canaries learn their beautiful bell notes, 
trills, flute notes, water notes, and shakes. 

A bird which gives promise of an unusually fine voice may be placed in 
a separate room for special instruction. He can be taught to whistle a song. 
The trainer whistles a song over and over for an hour at a time, three times 
a day, until the bird has mastered the notes. 

Unpainted cages are best for canaries or any other house birds. A bird 
will be sure to peck at every place that offers a hold for his bill, and it takes 
very little paint to poison him. Whether your bird's cage is of wood or metal,

give special attention to keeping it clean. It is almost impossible to have a 
healthy bird in a dirty cage. Keep fine loose gravel on the floor of the cage. 
If the floor is metal let the gravel lie on paper, so that the bird's feet may be 
kept from metal. Perches should be frequently washed, and carefully dried 
before they are replaced in the cage. 

Be careful about hanging your canary in or too near a window. He is 
very sensitive to drafts and will catch cold from a draft so slight you can- 
not feel it. Sunshine is not only unnecessary to a canary, but it is generally in- 
jurious. The bird may be placed in the sun's rays for a few minutes — ten or 
fifteen — after he has taken his bath, but that is quite enough. If the cage is in 
a strong light, such as it gets in a window, the bird will spend too much of his 
time hopping about, and his song will lose its soft and most pleasing notes, his 
voice becoming shrill and loud. Avoid giving your bird too much food. A 
good-sized teaspoonful of the mixed seed each day is enough, provided the food 
cup is so placed that the canary can reach all that is in it. If more seed than 
he can eat is furnished, the bird will pick out only the canary seed and leave 
the rape. If he is allowed to do this long, his voice and song will be spoiled. 
If your bird persists in eating only the canary seed, put in more rape and less 
canary seed. If necessary, give him rape seed only for a short time. 

Feed the canary a small piece of hard-boiled egg (yolk and white grated 
together) twice a week. This may be given each day while the bird is molting. 
A cuttle bone should always be kept in the cage, and it should be replaced with 
a fresh bone three times a year. 

Like the seed cup, the water cup should be cleaned every day and fresh 
water supplied for the bird. 

The canary's bed time is at dusk. His cage should then be covered and 
placed in a dark room. Paper is the best covering, but in using cloth or paper 
see that it is so arranged around the bottom of the cage that there are no 
upward draughts. 

Do not hang your canary so near the ceiling that it must breathe the 
bad air which collects there. Take him out of the room when it is being swept. 
The dust which he must otherwise breathe is bad for his voice. Sixty-five de- 
grees, or a little higher, is the best temperature for canaries. 

Many of the canary's most dangerous diseases are due to colds. Hence 
the stress that has been laid upon the necessity for avoiding draughts. When 
a canary has caught cold his body puffs up and his breathing becomes labored, 
while his appetite is much more than normal. On the first appearance of these 
signs give the bird a paste made of one-third hard-boiled egg (both yolk and 
white) grated together with a liberal pinch of red pepper and two or three 
drops of olive oil. Put two drops of alcohol in the drinking water. A piece of 
fat salt pork, raw, should be hung in the cage. If the cold does not yield 
readily to this treatment, it is best to consult a bird dealer. Never neglect the 
cold. Treat asthma as you do the cold, but cut the salt pork into very fine 
pieces and sprinkle it with red pepper. Give the bird a little bread soaked in 
warm milk, and put only rape seed in the food cup. 

Loss of voice is usually the result of a cold, and is treated in the same 
way as a cold. Sometimes it is due to oversinging. In that case let a very 
small piece of rock candy be dissolved in the drinking water, feed the bird the 
e gg. pepper, and oil paste, and cover the cage to keep him from trying to sing. 
Too much food, especially too much rich food, often causes epilepsy or fits. 
A sudden fright or hanging in the hot sun, sometimes has the same results. 



DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 231 

Let the bird have fresh air and sprinkle cold water on his head. If the fits 
are due to the heat, let the canary breathe smelling salts and sprinkle his head. 

Close confinement in a small cage, or in a dirty cage of any size, will 
cause cramps. Put the canary in a larger or clean cage. Hold his legs in warm 
water, and put two drops of laudanum in his drinking water. Dirty cages will 
cause sore feet. Soak the feet in warm water, wipe dry, and rub them gently 
with glycerine. 

When the nails on your canary's feet grow long and interfere with his 
walking they should be trimmed. By holding the bird up to the light the vein 
in each nail can be seen. Cut the nail with a sharp knife or scissors, taking 
great care not to cut as far back as the vein. The beak may also become 
overgrown and need to be trimmed. It is wiser to take the bird to a dealer for 
this operation. This caution applies also to broken legs. Do not try to set 
your bird's broken leg at home. 

No matter how clean you keep the canary's cage, it will occasionally 
become infested with little red insects which are almost too small to be seen 
with the naked eye. These insects irritate the bird, and, if left alone, will de- 
stroy his health. If your bird persistently scratches and pecks at his feathers 
and body, especially after settling upon his perch for the night, look for the 
little red pests. Give the bird a thorough dusting with insect powder, rubbing 
it through his feathers with your fingers to make sure that it reaches every part 
of his body. If the cage is of metal, unscrew the hollow top, fill it with the 
powder, and replace it. If the cage is wooden, put the canary into another 
one and give the wooden cage a thorough washing with suds made from car- 
bolic soap. Let it be well dried before it is again used. 

Another simple method of ridding the bird of insects is to substitute for 
the ordinary perch a hollow reed with two or three notches cut in the center 
on one side. The perch will be found filled with the insects in the morning, 
and they can be shaken out into the fire. Keep this up three or four days and 
all the insects will be caught. The perch should be occasionally dipped into 
boiling water to destroy any insects that were not shaken out. 

Still another effective remedy for these insects is to put under each wing 
of the bird a mere trace (less than half a drop) of kerosene oil. This should 
be repeated in ten days. 

What has been said about canaries and the treatment of their diseases 
will apply generally to other birds usually kept in the home whose principal 
food is seeds. Among these are the linnet, bullfinch, goldfinch, chaffinch, and 
the paroquet. 

The mocking bird, which is a favorite in many homes, requires careful 
and constant attention. He should have a large cage, and it should be kept 
very clean and well supplied with gravel. Prepared food obtained from your 
bird dealer is better for the mocking bird than any food you can prepare at 
home. Flies, grasshoppers, spiders, and other insects should be gathered at 
the proper seasons and hung in paper bags to dry. Feed these to the bird in 
winter, first softening them by pouring boiling water over them. Meal worms 
are also a delicacy for mocking birds, but they make rich food and should be 
given sparingly. Give your mocking bird a bath each day. 

Parrots need large cages or stands. The best food for a parrot is a 
mixture of equal parts of hemp, rice, cracked corn, and sun-flower seeds. He 
should have a small piece of cuttle bone each day. Fresh fruit may be given 
in limited quantities, but you can tell only by experience what kinds will be 
best for your bird. Never give your parrot meat or greasy food of any kind. 



232 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 

He will often relish a cracker or piece of bread soaked in coffee. Let the 
parrot have plenty of sand daily for his dry bath. Water baths should be given 
to him only once or twice a week. Use from a pint to a quart of water in which 
has been dissolved about a teaspoonful of borax, and spray the bird thoroughly 
with an atomizer. 

CATS. — There is no more common or useful house pet than a cat. 
While they are mostly a lady's pet, they usually show affection toward anyone 
who treats them well. Cats are seldom of a bad disposition, are not often seri- 
ously sick, and are very valuable as a preventive of rats and mice. Even 
though a cat does not catch these pests, its presence usually keeps them away. 
Cats are extremely affectionate, and become much liked by the members of the 
household. They are inexpensive to keep, some of them securing their own 
food almost entirely. These animals are by far the most graceful of the house 
pets and some of them are of very pretty colors. Angora cats are seldom good 
catchers of rats and mice, but when well cared for are very beautiful. There 
is an old common saying, although not well proven, that "tortoise shell" cats 
are the best ratters and mousers. Cats are naturally very clean in their habits, 
and the youngest kitten may be easily house-broken by simply showing it a 
few times where it can find a box of sawdust, sand, earth or ashes. 

DOGS. — The intelligence and fidelity of dogs is truly wonderful, and 
they have been well named "man's best animal friend." A good dog is always 
a valuable addition to the household, and few of them have bad dispositions 
unless caused by ill-treatment or constant teasing. Once a dog becomes truly 
attached to a person, it seems that no amount of cruelty can break their 
affection, and they will stick to their master until death. Although dogs thrive 
better where they can run freely on open ground, with care they may be kept in 
good condition in the city. Here they cannot find their natural remedies as 
in the country, and their ailments should be treated before they become seri- 
ous or chronic. Never abuse a dog or punish him unless you are sure he knows 
what the punishment is for. Dogs should be washed once a week in hot 
weather, and as often as necessary in winter. Winter washing should be done 
with temperate water and the dog kept in a warm room until perfectly dry. 
Keep him free from fleas, and the loose hairs brushed out of his coat. This will 
add to the dog's comfort, and yours, too, for both get about the house if neg- 
lected, and both are hard to remove. Make your dog work for his food, give 
him plenty of bones, but if he is sick tempt him with food. He will not eat it 
if it is not good for him. Provide shelter from heat and storm, do not allow 
manure to accumulate, and see that plentiful exercise is provided. In train- 
ing a dog, be patient, for while they are very intelligent, they are not human, 
and it may take a long time to make them understand just what you want them 
to do. Do not give the dog sweets, and feed as little grease as possible. Feed 
a mixed diet of raw meat, cooked meats, cooked vegetables, and dog biscuit, 
but never feed the same thing constantly, and do not feed more than twice a 
day. Hot food is unnatural, and should not be given to dogs, but it can be 
slightly warm in very cold weather. If the dog is suffering from diarrhoea, do 
not feed meats, but use starchy foods, such as boiled rice or barley. Flour 
and water gruel flavored with a very little cooked meat will often cure the 
complaint. 

FISH. — These graceful creatures sweeping about in the water are a 
never-ending source of enjoyment, and to watch them is very restful to the 
tired toilers of the household. Goldfish are by far the most satisfactory fish

to keep in a home aquarium. They are hardy, will stand considerable handling, 
require little food, and will live many years with proper care. They have been 
known to live fifty years. 

The aquarium for goldfish or any other fish should be square or oblong. 
The globes in which the fish are usually sold so distort the appearance of the 
fish that their true size and movements can be seen only from above. 

Cover the bottom of your aquarium with clean sand or pebbles to the 
depth of about two inches. Two or three small aquatic plants, such as are 
found in nearby creek or pond, should be placed on the gravel and weighted 
with pebbles so that they will retain their position until they have taken root. 
Then pour in clear, fresh water very slowly and carefully, so that the sand or 
gravel are not disturbed. Fill the tank to about two inches from the top. Drop 
into the water a few snails, such as are found in any pond. They are the best 
scavengers known for an aquarium, and are of great service in consuming de- 
caying vegetation. This done, the aquarium is ready for the fish. Do not over- 
feed your goldfish. A bit of toasted bread, which has been kept a long time 
and is perfectly dry when dropped into the water, or soda cracker are good 
foods. Feed about twice a week. In small aquariums, where the fish are 
crowded or large, the water should be changed often. In large aquariums, kept 
in well-ventilated rooms, the water requires changing less often, and may go 
for months by simply adding an amount equal to what has evaporated. When 
bubbles collect around the sides of the aquarium it is a sign that the water 
needs to be changed. Take care not to frighten your goldfish. The aquarium 
should be kept in the quietest part of the room, and it should always have 
fresh air. Drop into the water once in a while a small pinch of salt. It helps 
to sweeten and clarify the water. 

A disease which often attacks goldfish is a parasitic fungus or phlegm, 
due to the deposit of a micro-organism, which appears upon the fins and gills 
and soon spreads over the head and body and kills the fish. This disease is' 
probably caused by impure water, but when it appears, changing the water 
does not cure it. It may often be cured by plunging the fish into strong brine, 
or by washing it quickly and lightly with kerosene. 

PICTURES. 

See under the different rooms treated under the heading "Decorations" 
in this Department. 

ROACH EXTERMINATOR. 

Borax is one of the best exterminators. It should be pulverized and 
sprinkled around the infested places. Red lead made into a paste with flour 
and brown sugar and spread on small pieces of card distributed at night about 
infested places is also good. 

STOVES. 

COAL. — There are comparatively few city houses where coal stoves are 
used for heating at the present time, but a few words on the care of them may 
be of value. Keep the fire clear, and ashes removed. If the ashes are allowed 
to pile up to the grate it is apt to burn it out. Keep the stove well polished; 
it adds to the appearance and keeps dirt from accumulating. Never allow 
the stove to get so hot that it will warp, and never allow a hot stove to cool 
too quickly. In checking the fire, see that the drafts are so arranged that no 



DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING *35 



coal gas can escape. Always have a pan of fresh water on the stove or near 
it, as it moistens the heat and makes it carry better. Protect any nearby wood- 
work from blistering or burning by sheets of metal. 

COOKING. — The same general rules apply to Cooking stoves that we 
have given for heating stoves, but in addition, the fire must be kept clear all 
around so that oven and water-back may heat properly, and the dust and ashes 
must be frequently removed from above and below the oven. Wash the upper 
parts of the stove or range occasionally with lye water or ammonia water. 
This will prevent the greasy steam from coating it, and make it easier to 
polish. If possible arrange a hood over it connected with the chimney, so 
that the odors may not go through the house. There must be a damper in this 
pipe, however, or under certain conditions of the wind there will be no draft 
through the fire. Study the particular stove or range that you are working 
with so that you may learn to get the best use of it. 

ELECTRIC. — In these days electricity is gradually being used for 
everything, and those who have electricity in the house can secure both cook- 
ing and heating stoves as well as irons, chafing dishes, stew pans, etc., using 
electric heat instead of fuel. While this is more expensive now than the other 
methods, it has the advantage of less danger from fire, and of being abso- 
lutely clean. For light cooking or a small amount of heat, the expense is not 
worthy of consideration, while the comfort and convenience are very de- 
sirable. 

GAS. — The gas stove seems to become more and more popular, both for 
cooking and for certain classes of heating. This is no doubt due to the con- 
stant perfecting and improving of the stoves. Gas, at the rate we pay for it in 
Philadelphia, is not an expensive fuel when it is considered that there is no 
consumption except while it is actually being used. Gas heaters will make a 
cold room comfortable in a few minutes, and may then be turned down very 
low, or out entirely. If water is placed on them, the heat is not unhealthy, and 
there is no bother, dirt or ashes. The gas ranges of today are wonderful cre- 
ations of utility for the busy women of the home. Safety has been the greatest 
consideration with designers and manufacturers, and now the gas range is as 
safe as the coal range. They also are equipped with ovens that may be slow or 
hot as desired, warming ovens, iron racks and lots of other desirable features. 
The cost of these ranges is low compared to their cost a few years ago, and 
compared with even good cooking stoves using coal, and they may be taken 
along like the rest of the furniture in case of a removal. The gas company 
will run the pipes and connect these ranges free of charge for the con- 
sumer. 

SWEEPING. 

APPLIANCES. — Sweeping need not be the hard manual labor it was a 
few years ago, thanks to the modern appliances in this line. Last and per- 
haps greatest among these is the vacuum cleaner which has been described un- 
der "Carpets." These may be had at almost any price, and are worked by 
hand, foot, water and electric power. They are very sanitary, as no dust is 
allowed to fly about, but is gathered in such shape that it may be readily 
burned. The long-handled bristle brush is a labor-saver for smooth surfaces 
and raises less dust, while sweeping cleaner, than a broom. Cheap dustpans 
are now made so that it is not necessary to stoop to take up the dust, and 
numerous preparations may be had that allay the dust while sweeping. 



236 DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 



EASY. — While the above appliances save much of the labor of sweeping, 
more may be saved by properly handling the sweeping instruments. If a broom, 
it should be started back of where you are standing, and DRAWN, not pushed 
forward, past the feet to a position as far forward as may be reached without 
doubling the straws over. Press firmly down on the broom while making the 
sweep, but do not bear hard enough to bend more than the mere tips of the 
straws. If the bristle brush is used, very little pressure is necessary, as the 
weight of the brush is usually sufficient to make it sweep clean, and it may 
be pushed forward or drawn, as a person may desire. 

DUSTLESS. — See about Vacuum Cleaners under "Carpets" and "Sweep- 
ing Appliances." 

TABLE. 

DECORATIONS.— The decoration of the tables depends on the tastes 
of the individuals and the material at hand, but with some care and trouble, and 
little or no expense, all the tables in the house may be made attractive. Never 
allow the tables to become "catch-alls" for everything that somebody wants 
to be rid of. On the other hand, do not give them a stiff and stately appear- 
ance that makes them look like ornaments rather than like utilities. The selec- 
tion of articles to be placed on tables and the ordinary artistic way of placing 
them call for a home art that few men have, and even some women lack. 

DINING-ROOM. — This table calls for and deserves more attention 
than any other in the house. The placing of the dishes, glasses, silverware, 
salts and peppers, cruets, and the dishes of food, is in itself a matter of 
decoration, and adds or detracts from the appearance according to how it is 
done. There are dozens of ways of folding napkins for decorations, and there 
are flowers that may be tastily arranged. Fruit is a very easy source of decora- 
tion, as in individual pieces, baskets or mounds it may be made to look attrac- 
tive. The peel of oranges may be cut and turned back to resemble water lilies, 
bananas may be calla lilies, apples may be polished and turned so that their 
best coloring shows. Paper napkins may be used a thousand ways for decora- 
tion. Everything about the table should be clean and sparkling. See also 
"Dining-room Decoration." 

KITCHEN.— See "Kitchen Devices." 

LIBRARY. — The most important feature of the table in the library, sit- 
ting-room or living-room should be its light, for it is here the family gathers 
to read and converse, and those who read or sew should have light, while those 
talking may be in subdued or reflected light which is easy on the eyes. Don't 
forget that visitors will judge your tastes by what they see on this table. Only 
the best books and the current magazines should be kept there unless in use at 
the time. If a cover is used, have it of mild colors. Dark ones absorb too 
much light, while white makes a glare and soils quickly. 

PARLOR. — This should be the plainest table in the house. If you have 
a fine hardwood table, use a centerpiece, but do not cover it entirely. Have 
a nice, fancy-shaded drop light on it if possible, but very little else. One or 
two well-bound standard books of masters in prose or poem, or perhaps a 
small card tray would be enough. Do not allow odds and ends to gather here, 
as it is one of the first things a visitor will see, and your reputation as a house- 
keeper may be much influenced by its appearance. 



DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 237 



TOILETS. 

The great adjuncts to our health and comfort should be what they 
seldom are — pleasant places. It is generally because we do not start right. 
A toilet that is cleansed often is never hard to clean, and we strong- 
ly urge the housewife to see to this important item carefully. It will 
make her work easier and everybody's health better and comfort greater. As 
important as cleanliness in the toilet is ventilation. If possible, have ventila- 
tion direct from just below the seat. If near a window, this may be home- 
made, but still very effective. Even an old piece of hose or speaking tube run 
out of the window from under the seat is better than nothing. The room 
should be well aired, and, where possible, direct sunlight allowed in. The 
room may be kept sweet by saucers of chlorides or dry lime being always 
exposed to the air. Odors in a small compartment like this may be immedi- 
ately relieved by twisting an old newspaper into a torch and waving it about 
as it burns. 

VENTILATION. 

This subject has been discussed more or less under the Health and Hy- 
giene, and under the different rooms, but it is of such importance that we can- 
not impress it on our readers too strongly that fresh air is an absolute neces- 
sity if health is to be found or retained. The great modern scourge, consump- 
tion, could never have secured the awful foothold it has if proper ventilation 
had been given all homes, and there is no greater aid in curing it than fresh 
air. Always keep in mind the fact that heat rises, and that for most of the year 
the air in the house is warmer than that outside. On general principles, you 
should see that fresh air can get in at the bottom of your house or room, and 
the stale air out at the top. This rule must, of course, be varied to suit con- 
ditions. Do not allow strong drafts to strike anyone, and when the weather 
is cold, the fresh air should enter at a point where it will become warmed at 
least slightly before passing through the house. A careful adjustment of doors 
and windows will keep a constant current of air circulating through the house 
or room without chilling it or causing injurious drafts. 

WALLPAPER CLEANING. 
Take the centre of a loaf of bread two days old; it must neither be newer 
nor staler. With one of these pieces, after having blown off all the dust from 
the paper to be cleaned, by the means of a good pair of bellows, begin at the 
top of the room, holding the crust in the hand, and wiping lightly downward, 
about half a yard at each stroke, until the upper part of the hangings is com- 
pletely cleaned all around. Then go around again, with the like sweeping stroke 
downward, always commencing each successive course a little higher than the 
upper stroke had extended, till the bottom be finished. This operation, if care- 
fully performed, will frequently make a very old paper look almost equal to 
new. Great caution must be used not to rub the paper hard, not to attempt 
cleaning in the cross or horizontal way. The dirty part of the bread, too, must 
be each time cut away, and the pieces renewed as soon as it may become 
necessary. 

WALLS. 
These very important parts of our dwellings are neglected by probably 
two-thirds of our housekeepers, and yet, as to our health, they are cf the great- 
est importance. Walls are never perfectly smooth, and if examined with a 



238 



DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 



microscope, they will be found to be covered and all the little roughness filled 
with germ-harboring dust. In spite of this, thousands of houses never have 
the walls touched except in housecleaning or paperhanging time. This is no 
doubt because the dust does not show until the coating becomes thick enough 
to chance the color. To clean the walls of a room, the floor should be thor- 
oughly cleaned first, so that little dust will rise and settle on the walls again. 
Then take an atomizer filled with some germicide, and, after closing the room, 
blow this about until the air of the room is vaporized. Then take down the 
pictures and dust each one carefully with a clean cloth. Then wipe the walls, 
doing the ceiling first, and then the sides, from the top down. The floor should 
then be gently cleaned again, and the room well aired before rearranging.

WINDOWS. 
CLEANING. — Of the foremost importance in the cleaning of windows 
is care for the person. Thousands of persons are killed or injured because 
proper precautions were not made for this hazardous undertaking. No person 
should ever take any risk that can be avoided, and persons who get dizzy or 
those with poor hearts should avoid it entirely, if possible. Secure a long- 
handled brush, and clean all the windows you can from the ground. By draw- 
ing both sashes to the centre, and reaching from top and bottom, most win- 
dows can be well cleaned without the body being outside at all. First wet the 



DEPARTMENT OF HOUSEKEEPING 241 



windows thoroughly. Then rub with a wet rag to remove any dirt that sticks, 
and then flush again with plenty of water. When partly dry, rub briskly with 
a piece of chamois or flannel, and you will have a clear, clean glass. If the 
windows are particularly dirty, use soap, but never use sand soap or scratch 
at the window with sharp instruments, as they will mark the glass. 

DECORATING.— The treatment of the windows may make or mar the 
outside appearance of the heme. The color of the curtains should harmonize 
with the colors of the exterior, and should always be evenly drawn. Some very 
pretty effects are obtained by double curtains of contrasting colors, drawn 
evenly to different points. Lace curtains, well draped, add class to the appear- 
ance of the windows either by day or night. Flowers are always delightful in 
a window, and add an air of coziness, whether seen from inside or out. 



WOODWORK. 

Where painted wainscot or other woodwork requires cleaning, fuller's 
earth will be found cheap and useful, and on wood not painted it forms an ex- 
cellent substitute for soap. Where extreme nicety is required, use a mixture 
of one pound of soft soap, two ounces of wood ash, one pint of lard, and one 
pint of table beer; simmer these substances over a slow fire, and let them be 
well mixed. The mode of application is to put a small quantity in flannel; rub 
it on the woodwork, wash it off with warm water and dry thoroughly with a 
linen cloth. This will clean painted woodwork without removing the paint. 



Department of Children 



INFANTS. 



CARE. — Many young women allow a false modesty to bring them to 
wedlock, and even motherhood, in a state of profound ignorance. Nature made 
women to bear children, and it is in no sense immodest for her to prepare 
for such events. The care of children really begins before the birth. As soon 
as a woman knows her condition she should dress loosely and comfortably, 
and not prevent the natural growth of waist or breast. She should bathe 
freely in mild, warm water, spend as much time in the open air as possible, 
exercise moderately, keep herself busy, be cheerful, keep her bowels regular, 
and herself in good health and spirits. She should not try to hide what all 
good people consider the highest destiny of woman. She should avoid heavy 
foods, retire early, and avoid strains or bumps. The husband should be par- 
ticularly kind and cheerful, as bitterness of the mother at this time will warp 
the nature of the child. It is well for the woman to interest herself in making 
a complete baby outfit of clothing, so there will be no worry on this point 
when she is sick. It is poor economy to have any but an excellent physician 
at this time. When the little one arrives, it must be kept warm and dry, and 
well fed. There are many theories as to proper feeding, but an infant should 
never be allowed to suffer from hunger. The baby should be taken out often 
for an airing, and should be well protected, as at this age it is particularly im- 
portant that they be kept warm and dry. Babies should not be held or allowed 
to lie too long in one position, as it prevents development. During the first 
two or three weeks they should be allowed to lie on a bed, and only taken up 
to feed. Bathe them often in mild, warm water, dry thoroughly and dress them 
for comfort according to the season. Handle them carefully, as rough treat- 
ment, even though not intended, will be reflected in their entire life. Do not 
allow any drafts to blow on them. Keep them from extreme cold or heat — 
both are injurious. Let them rise early if they wake naturally, and sleep often 
during the day. Exercise them regularly, as much in the open air as possible, 
but do not allow them to get very tired. 

Babies as well as older folks need water; do not fail to wet their lips 
often. 

CLOTHING. — The clothing of infants must be governed largely by the 
circumstances of the parents, but much can be done by care as well as by 
expense. The poorest mother can always find a way to keep the infant warm 
and protect it from the weather, and care in changing often enough to keep 
it dry and clean will do more for its comfort than buying expensive garments. 
Flannels are excellent. The little one is particularly sensitive to disease, and 
the greatest care should be used in seeing that the clothing is clean, free from 
dust and well aired. Underclothing should be slightly warmed previous to 
putting it on. Clothing should be loose and free, and kept well aired.

244 DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN 

INFANTS' DISEASES. 

The following treatments are for emergency only and do not in any wise 
warrant a parent in dispensing with the services of a physician. These home 
treatments will prove effective in most cases, but where the child's trouble does 
not respond to the treatment, a doctor should be immediately consulted. Where 
any strong or poisonous drugs are suggested, the greatest care must be used. 

CHOLERA INFANTUM. 

First treatment, mercury and chalk, quarter grain every hour. In the 
early stages of the disease, Ipecacuauha will often relieve it. Use warm poul- 
tices on abdomen, and give lime water and milk for vomiting. Crude Anti- 
mony when the mouth is dry, tongue coated, and stools slimy. 

COLIC. 

Use Asafetida, ten to fifteen drops every hour, or a teaspoonful of 
Chamomite tea every quarter hour. Inject thin starch with twenty-five drops 
of laudanum. Keep bowels open with castor oil. Mustard plaster and vinegar 
on the abdomen. 

CONSTIPATION.— Make a tea of one teaspoonful of flaxseed and a 
cup of boiling water. Give two or three teaspoonfuls every hour until re- 
lieved. 

CONVULSIONS.— Place the child in a warm bath, and place a cold, 
damp cloth on the head. Use laxatives, keep the bowels open, and the body 
warm. If caused by coming teeth, a physician should lance the gum to the 
tooth. If there seems to be worms, use a vermifuge. Diarrhoea. Give tea- 
spoonful of castor oil with five or eight drops of laudanum, it cleans out and 
sooths the bowels. Then use a mild astringent, such as a good blackberry 
cordial, in teaspoonful doses until relieved. 

SPASMS. — Give quarter of a five-grain tablet of Acetanilid every half 
hour until eased. 

WORMS. — Make a paste of sugar and ground pumpkin seeds, dilute with 
milk and give two or three teaspoonfuls every two hours. 

FOODS. 

Nature usually furnishes che mother with the very best food that the 
infant can have, and when she has it, it is best for both herself and the baby 
that the mother's milk be used for several weeks. The baby should start nurs- 
ing from five to seven hours after birth, and should be kept at it occasionally 
until the milk is well started. Then regular hours of feeding should be set, and 
not varied from unless convinced that it is actually very hungry. Two hours 
apart is good in most cases during the day time, and three to four hours dur- 
ing the night. It is not wise, as a rule, to awaken the baby to feed, unless it 
should remain asleep long past the feeding time. The mother should keep a 
plentiful supply of milk, by the use of good foods or even mild stimulants. 
In cases where the mother cannot supply proper milk, a wet-nurse may be em- 
ployed, but the baby is so susceptible to influences that great care should be 
taken that she is of good disposition, clean, healthy, moral and efficient. The 
best results are usually obtained from one whose own baby is a week or so 
older than the one she is to feed. 



DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN 845 

If the mother's milk is of poor quality or small quantity certain of the 
regular nursings may be replaced by infant's food, modified milk, etc. If the 
mother has little or no milk, pure cow's milk should be used, first sterilized, 
and then modified to more closely take the place of the mother's milk. The 
milk of the mother varies with the age of the child, and therefore the cow's 
milk must be modified differently. During the first two weeks, three teaspoon- 
fuls of milk sugar and one-third of an ounce of lime-water should be added to 
each pint of milk. As the child grows older, more milk sugar and lime-water 
should be added, until at the end of a year, twice the amount is added. Richer 
milk may also be used as the baby grows older. An occasional drink of barley 
water is also good. In spite of cases to the contrary, it is the general opinion 
of the best physicians that no prepared foods of course of feeding is really good 
if it altogether leaves out cow's milk in some form. It is of the greatest im- 
portance that the baby's food be perfectly clean and sterile. Breast or bottle 
should be washed with a solution of boric acid before using, and thoroughly 
cleansed afterward. Use only nipples that can be removed from the bottles 
and properly cleaned. 

An excellent infant food can be made as follows: Dissolve four tea- 
spoonfuls of milk sugar in seven ounces of water, add one ounce of milk, three 
of cream, and a half ounce of lime-water. Then place the container in water 
and boil the water, but not the food, for ten minutes. Place in a cool place 
until nursing time, then take a quarter or less of this and heat in a bottle in 
warm water to normal temperature. 

The amount that a normal baby requires of a food like the above, at two- 
hour intervals, varies from an ounce when born to ten or more by the end of 
a year. 

QUIETING. — The matter of quieting infants will, no doubt, remain a 
prolific source of argument until the end, but it is generally agreed that it is 
more a matter of keeping cool and using common sense than anything else. It 
is so natural for the mother's love to so distress her that she goes contrary 
to her best judgment in order to stop the crying. It is good for babies to 
cry some — it is Nature's method of exercising and developing the lungs. No 
baby should be allowed to cry from pain, but the cause should be determined 
as well as possible and the proper remedy applied. Babies are very apt to 
acquire the habit of crying from fright. Care should be used to keep them from 
getting nervous. Do not "Boo" at them or make sudden or loud noises to at- 
tract their attention. It is wrong to allow a baby to cry unattended. Go to it, 
find the cause, if possible, comfort it if frightened, treat it if ill, and only when 
you are sure it is purely a display of temper must it be shown that you refuse 
to do for it. Do all possible to make it strong: weak babies cry more than 
strong ones. 

TEETHING. — The first or "baby" teeth make their appearance at about 
the sixth month if the child is normal and healthy, but later if in poor health. 
Teething is a trying ordeal for children, and they should be watched carefully 
and kept in the best condition possible. The first set are twenty in number, 
the first appearing in the front of the lower jaw, and others following until they 
are nearly three years old. If the suffering is intense, so that the child wor- 
ries and becomes nervous, a firm rubbing of the gums over the coming tooth 
will often bring relief, although in some cases it is necessary to lance the gum 
and help the tooth out. As a rule opiates and soothing remedies do no perma- 
nent good, and often do harm.

CHILDREN. 

CARE. — The care of children is a big investment of time and love and 
care by the parents, but one which is returned with a high rate of interest as 
the child develops into manhood or womanhood that makes them justly proud. 
It is a certainty that those children whose parents are least indulgent develop 
better, both in mind and body. Many a child goes through life badly handi- 
capped by the misdirected love of parents who could afford indulgences that 
prevented proper development of their latent powers. It is so natural for most 
of us to imitate those we love that most parents talk to children in their own 
unintelligible jargon. While this is not necessarily vicious, development will 
be more rapid without it. Thousands of times daily the careful mother will 
see an opportunity to tell or show the child how to do things to develop its 
different faculties. This should be done in such a way that they will not 
realize they are being taught, and will naturally continue to develop without 
always having an example. Never wake children with sudden noise or rough 
touch. Do not take them suddenly from darkness into bright light. Let them 
have plenty of sleep, on mattresses, in well-ventilated rooms; lots of play and 
pleasure, much outdoor exercise, certain duties to perform regularly, and teach 
them to confide in you, for only in this way can you know what is best for 
them. Give them plenty to eat, at regular hours, but avoid rich and indigestible 
foods. Allow them no stimulants, such as tea, coffee or alcoholic beverages. 
Avoid highly spiced foods. With careful home training a normal child should 
be ready to enter school and do well at five to seven years old. Watch them 
carefully for signs of bad habits, and if you have their confidence, you can pre- 
vent their acquirement. On account of their imitative powers they should be 
kept away from evil influences, and the parents have a great responsibility in 
the example they set. Do not think that the child is too young to understand, 
for what it sees and hears even when very young has an influence on its life. 
Do not give way to a child which is wrong because it cries or makes a scene. 
This teaches them to do the same in every case, and they lose confidence in 
you, and think you do not mean what you say. Remember that a child, through 
ignorance, may do an evil act from a good motive, in which case it should be 
corrected, but not punished. The best authorities are agreed that whipping 
should be seldom if ever done, and where it is necessary, the child is usually 
punished for the fault of the parents in earlier training. Rewarding is far* 
better than punishment, but this must be done with great care, or the child 
will think it must be paid for everything it does. Try to prevent boys from 
acquiring the tobacco habit. They are better off without it, and in no case 
should it be permitted until full growth is acquired. Don't forget that all the 
care you spend on the children comes back, not only in satisfaction with their 
development, but in improvement of yourself. 

CLOTHING. — In the clothing of children, the first and most important 
consideration is health. The parents should protect the children properly, but 
not to such a degree that they become too tender to stand conditions that are 
likely to arise. The so-called "hardening" of children is a very dangerous 
process unless done with sufficient care, but when properly done is very desira- 
ble. This can only be accomplished by the greatest care and patience, and no 
set rule can be laid down for it, as every child is a law unto itself. The disposi- 
tion as well as the constitution must be taken into consideration. Discomfort 
will spoil some temperaments. Anything but complete protection would be 
fatal to some. The condition of children at the time must be considered, too;

what will do them good at one time will harm them at another. They should be 
protected from extreme cold by warm, snug-fitting clothes, and from extreme 
heat by light, loose clothing. 

Where the parents can afford it, it is well to dress a child in a manner as 
nearly equal to its associates as possible. Some children are so constituted 
that they shrink from others who are dressed much better than they, and 
develop a shrinking disposition that is a serious handicap. On the other hand, 
a child who is dressed beyond its station in life is developing false ideas, and 
is apt to become foppish and unable to meet the strenuous conditions of an 
active life. Give them clothes to play in that they need not be afraid of 
spoiling. 

CHILDREN'S DISEASES. 

We wish to impress upon our readers that the following are simply hints 
and information that may prove valuable in the treatment of very slight cases, 
or in preliminary treatment. Do not try to "doctor" your own children. In 
this city good physicians are plentiful and their advice usually a good invest- 
ment. 

"It's better to be safe than sorry." 

CHICKEN-POX. — This is a contagious disease, of a mild form, develop- 
ing eruptions of the skin. It seldom occurs after the sixth year, and can only 
be had once in a lifetime. It usually develops about two weeks after exposure 
to it. It is sometimes preceded by chilliness, aching, slight fever, etc., but 
sometimes the spots are the first indication. Each spot comes to maturity, 
fills with liquid and dries up within two or three days. Others follow for sev- 
eral days and the child must not be allowed to scratch, or scars will result. 
This disease is sometimes mistaken for smallpox, but can be distinguished by 
the spots appearing more quickly and showing in different stages of develop- 
ment. Use plenty of cooling drinks, keep the bowels open, and give something 
to reduce the fever if high. The patient should be kept away from all other 
children, and everything well disinfected. 

CROUP — This disease is prevalent among children, but rare among 
adults. It may be repeated in the same patient. It is dangerous if not treated 
very promptly, but responds quickly to treatment, and is seldom fatal if taken 
in time. It is a disease of the larynx and vicinity, developing swellings in the 
throat, and a heavy mucous that in some cases becomes a membrane which will 
entirely stop breathing. It begins with an ordinary cold, accompanied by a 
cough and breathing of a peculiar character and sound. Syrup of ipecac or 
some emetic should be given at once, until free vomiting occurs. The feet 
should be soaked in hot water and rubbed well with flannels. Mustard plas- 
ters, or flannels wrung out of hot water and turpentine, should be applied to 
the outside of the throat. The bowels should be kept free with a mild laxative. 
After the vomiting, a few drops of kerosene oil on sugar will often bring prompt 
relief. The patient should be kept warm and dry, and in an even temperature 
for a few days, to prevent a recurrence. If croup does not respond quickly to 
care and home treatment, no time should be lost in securing a physician. 

CONSTIPATION. — This disease is local in the lower intestines, but its 
causes may be serious and general, and a tendency to it should be cured, for if 
it becomes habitual, it takes long and tedious treatment to correct it. It may 
be caused by numerous conditions, such as improper eating, fevered condition, 
lack of exercise, etc., and is more common among females than males. When 



DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN 249 

the trouble occurs only occasionally, castor oil or other laxative is usually ef- 
fective, but the cause should be corrected to prevent recurrence. When it has 
become chronic, laxatives must be used in connection with a course of diet and 
treatment. Drink cold water and eat oranges or laxative fruits in the morn- 
ing, and exercise so that circulation is free and the muscles of the abdomen kept 
active. 

CONVULSIONS.— If the children are young, the treatment should be 
like that given for infants, but stronger. If older, when the fits are more apt 
to be of an epileptic tendency, loosen all the clothing about the neck, see that 
they breathe fresh air, or relieve the spasm by placing the body in a warm 
mustard bath and then place an ice bag on the back of the neck. Children 
with a tendency to this disease should avoid rich or heavy foods, especially fatty 
meats. 

DIARRHOEA. — The mere fact of frequent or liquid passages from the 
bowels does not indicate the presence of the disease. It may be merely Nature's 
method of expelling objectionable matter by the juices of the intestines. 
Diarrhoea is caused by cold, worry or bad physical condition, or may come 
from insufficient or improper foods, or many other causes. As a rule, this dis- 
ease is a natural effort to get rid of something, and the passages should not be 
stopped too quickly. Take a dose of castor oil with from 5 to 12 drops of 
laudanum in it. If the stomach will not stand this, use a suppository. Follow 
this with ten drops of laudanum, three of spirits of camphor and eight of laven- 
der, taken in a teaspoonful of sugar every hour or two until relieved. To pre- 
vent a recurrence, the diet should be reduced to tea, beef-tea, boiled milk, milk 
toast, rice, and tapioca, and great care should be taken to prevent taking cold. 

DIPHTHERIA. — This disease is one that admits of no experimenting, 
and as soon as it is suspected, a physician should be summoned. It will be our 
aim to simply give some advice as to relief or treatment previous to the com- 
ing of the doctor. This disease is local in the membranes of the throat, but 
is accompanied by great weakness. It is seldom found in adults, and in the 
most common form, the first indications are prostration, a spasmodic cough, and 
difficulty in breathing. It usually develops within five days of exposure. When 
a child has been exposed to it, or develops a sore throat, with bad breath, it 
should be isolated at once, and disinfecting done to prevent possible spread. 
Any other children in the house should be prevented from going out among 
others until the case is diagnosed. In cases where this disease is suspected, 
it is well to us an atomizer to spray the throat with peroxide of hydrogen. 

MEASLES. — This disease is very contagious, and may be taken from 
infected articles as well as from the patient direct. It develops in about two 
weeks after exposure, and usually starts with fever, headache, cold in the head 
and possible sickness of the stomach, with a cough. These conditions con- 
tinue to increase for three or four days, when the spots appear on the face 
and neck, and later appear over the entire body. Although they sometimes 
come together in groups, they seldom cover the entire surface. The spots 
continue for only about a day before they begin to fade. The eyes are very 
sensitive to light, and often discharge freely. Measles are often mistaken for 
scarlet fever, but there is more catarrh and less sore throat, and the spots are 
less uniform. The patient should be isolated, liberal disinfecting done, no risk 
of cold should be taken, and the room should be darkened. Warm baths and 
hot drinks should be used to bring out the spots, which must appear before the 
patient can begin to recover. Bathe frequently with lukewarm water or alcohol, 



250 DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN 



exposing only part at a time, to reduce the fever and ease the irritation. Light, 
plain diet should be used for some time. White measles are not often fatal, but 
there are so many complications that may arise that it is best to consult a physi- 
cian. 

MUMPS. — This infectious disease is local in certain glands of the 
upper throat, and usually develops in about fifteen days after exposure to con- 
tagion. Unless complicated, it is seldom serious. There is slight fever, and 
a swelling of the glands, which may or may not be painful, but makes swallow- 
ing, eating and talking difficult. It may occur on one or both sides, but seldom 
attacks the same glands twice. It usually lasts less than ten days. Guard care- 
fully against colds, and use liquid or soft diet. Keep the bowels open, use some 
fever mixture, and apply hot or cold treatment according to the inclinations of 
the patient. 

NAUSEA. — Give warm water until the child vomits freely, and then apply 
a mustard plaster to the stomach for an hour or so. If the mustard is mixed 
with the white of an egg, no blister will be made. 

SCARLET FEVER. — This is another disease of such dangerous char- 
acter that no time should be lost in calling in a doctor if it is suspected. It is 
a very infectious disease, developing in about ten days after exposure, with 
fever, sore throat and eruptions. It appears very suddenly, with high fever, hard 
vomiting, chills, headache, swollen and rough tongue, or throat dry and in- 
flamed. This is closely followed by a bright red rash, seen first on the chest, 
then rapidly covering the body with a fairly even coating of tiny red points. 
The glands of the neck swell, itching is persistent, and the passage from the 
mouth to the ear is liable to become diseased and cause deafness. It is a tre- 
mendous strain on the child's strength, but seldom comes twice. When its 
presence is suspected, rigid isolation and persistent fumigation should be in- 
sisted on, and the patient should be bathed in warm water to bring out the 
eruption. Keep an even temperature, as colds are very serious. Every article 
that has come in contact with the patient should be burned when the doctor 
assures you that there is no further danger of contagion arising from the 
patient. 

SPASMS. — Strong, black coffee is good where the child is weak or nerv- 
ous. If the child shows drowsiness, with spasmodic jerking of the limbs, 
chamomilla will be found good. If the child starts suddenly from sleep, give a 
teaspoonful of camphor solution in a glass of water. The camphor solution will 
be found good in most cases of spasms, from a number of causes. 

WHOOPING COUGH. — This is a contagious disease confined mostly 
to children, and is often serious in its complications and after-effects. It is a 
catarrhal condition of the air passages, accompanied by a peculiar cough, fol- 
lowed by the "whoop" from which it gets its name. It starts like an ordinary 
cough or cold, increasing until the child becomes blue in the face during the 
coughing spells. Heavy mucous is formed and the child often vomits and has 
bleeding of the nose. It seldom occurs twice in the same patient. The patient 
should be kept away from other children, but must have plenty of fresh air, and 
should be so protected against possible cold that plenty of outdoor exercise may 
be had. An old treatment which has proved good is sliced onions and garlic 
stewed in sweet oil, to which is added 10% each of spirits of camphor and pare- 
goric. Give one spoonful of this three or four times daily. This disease may 
last for several weeks, and needs care to avoid colds and complications more 
than definite treatment.

258 DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN 

WORMS. — Children are liable to three kinds of worms. The tape worm, 
the round white worms of the intestines, and the little pin worms of the rectum. 
They are usually indicated by a general weakness and nervousness. The tape 
worm is a severe drain on the system, and the patient develops a ravenous appe- 
tite and still may lose flesh. The pin worms cause an intense itching, more 
noticeable at night. Nothing but liquid food and milk laxatives for twenty-four 
hours, followed by a vermifuge and a severe purgative, will usually remove 
them, but in the case of a tape worm it must be examined to see that the head 
is passed, for if it is not, a new body will grow on. To remove worms, peel and 
beat pumpkin seeds into sugar until a paste is formed. Dilute with milk, and 
drink freely on an empty stomach. 

ENTERTAINMENT-PARTIES.— There are two kinds of parties for 
children that are desirable, those for pure recreation, and those for education 
and training. For children who are attending school, and whose minds are 
working hard on their studies, the parties should be such as relax the mental 
strain and afford them pure amusement. Give them free rein to cut up and do 
all the little foolish and hilarious things they want to, always keeping care- 
ful watch that their high spirits do not carry them to a point where their man- 
ners or moral tendencies may be affected wrongly. Encourage games of romp, 
for physical exercise is essential to balance the mental. Encourage music and 
singing; both are mental antidotes. When refreshments are served, they 
should be light, comparatively plain, and cooling. Do not give them such a 
banquet that it stands out in their memory as the most important event of the 
evening. While kissing games are not usually vicious, there are so many con- 
tagious diseases affecting the breath of children that they should be discour- 
aged. 

Where children are not studying too hard, or even occasionally for those 
who are students, it is well to have parties where everything done is of some 
educational value. The lessons learned under these pleasant conditions are 
seldom forgotten. Prizes (not necessarily of any great value) can be awarded, 
not as favors, but for meritorious work under strict rules of contest.. Recita- 
tions, games of proverbs and quotations, music, spelling-bees, guessing 
matches, etc., all are valuable. 

GAMES. — From the earliest, children should be allowed toys and games 
that amuse them provided they do not develop a tendency to extravagance. 
Many a child has been granted everything it wanted to play with, and has 
grown up feeling that its every wish must be granted, and being unhappy when 
denied. Endeavor to cultivate in the child a liking for such amusements as will 
be beneficial. This can readily be done by taking hearty part in them yourself. 
Probably the greatest evils to be guarded against are selfishness and rudeness, 
and they are hard to see until they have such a firm hold that the breaking is 
painful. Encourage games of physical exercise, especially out of doors. All 
contain some danger of minor physical mishap, but are more than made up for 
in general health. Avoid games of chance. Be sure to have rooms where 
children are gathered well ventilated, especially where the games are active. 

HABITS. — Bad habits can only be prevented and overcome properly 
by the mother or caretaker deserving the absolute confidence of the child. 
Children acquire habits more readily than adults, but can be easily taught to 
overcome them. It is well to reason with children, explaining in plain words 
why you want them to do things. Sucking the thumbs, and biting the finger 
nails can be stopped by explanations that create a desire to stop, and by dip-

ping the fingers in some lasting, bitter liquid that will prevent it when done un- 
consciously. Children should never be granted what has been refused. 
Continued coaxing or scenes of temper become fixed bad habits when success- 
ful. When children are inclined to stoop the shoulders, encourage deep breath- 
ing, keep the health good, and keep dwelling on the importance of an upright 
carriage. If necessary, use braces for a short time occasionally. Picking the 
nose is often a sign of worms. If so, remove them. The habit can only be 
overcome by continued talking and reproof whenever noticed. Never punish 
children in such a way that they will dread you. This will teach them to de- 
ceive in order to avoid punishment, when they may already be sorry for what 
they have done. Justice is the greatest thing in the world to most children. 
Probably the most serious habit of children is that of indulgence in immoral 
thoughts and self-abuse when the age of passion and sexual feelings is reached. 
A great proportion of this evil is caused by ignorance, giving the child oppor- 
tunity to indulge in immoral speculations. A thorough knowledge of sexual 
matters should be given the children at this time, and great is the responsibility 
resting on those parents who neglect doing so. 

HEALTH. — Regularity is probably the key note to the health of chil- 
dren. They have had no definite responsibility in life, and regularity is not nat- 
ural to them, but must be compelled. Regularity should be enforced in rising in 
the morning, evacuation of the bowels, the kind of clothing worn, the time 
(and to some extent the quantity) of meals, work or play, in resting, in retiring, 
and in the hours of sleep. Guard them carefully against colds or contagion, 
keep the bowels moving freely, and allow them out of doors as much as pos- 
sible, unless the weather or their own condition make it inadvisable. Give them 
plenty to eat, but guard against overeating. Give them good, strong foods, but 
prevent too great a proportion of rich or sweet foods. Keep the mind as well 
as the body active, yet prevent overstudy. Many a child's strength is being 
all used in growing, and even at the cost of a year lost from school, the health 
should be protected. Never allow children to sleep in a close room, even in 
winter. Pure air is an absolute necessity. Cover them warmly in bed, and give 
their bedroom plenty of air without direct drafts upon them. When a child 
shows indisposition or lack of energy, examine at once for an ailment, locate it 
and treat it, or send for a doctor. It is a child's nature to be energetic, and all 
their physical troubles are easier to correct before they have made much prog- 
ress. Children should be hardened gradually to changes of atmosphere, but 
this must be done with great care, and better under the direction of your 
physician. Frequent bathing and absolute cleanliness are absolutely essential. 
Try to avoid nervousness. 

MANAGEMENT. — The management of children should be carefully 
thought out and a general plan made even before the baby arrives. It is of 
the utmost importance that it begin at once, as the ease or trouble of managing 
the child in later years may depend largely on the earlier treatment. No one 
knows exactly how much a child understands of what is going on about it, 
and, not only does the child acquire the habit of expecting certain treatment, 
but the parents soon fasten upon themselves the habit of treating them in that 
way. Many very fine characters have been developed under a harsh and un- 
yielding mastery of parents, but the child's nature becomes cold as well as cor- 
rect. The true spirit of love and companionship is the best management, and 
the children will learn to do as you wish because it is their pleasure to please 
you, and they know it must be the right thing to do, or you would not ask it. 



DEPARTMENT OF CHILDREN 255 

As much as possible, the management of children should be left in the hands 
of the parents. Too many persons trying to have a child learn their way will 
simply confuse it, and it is bound to come to the conclusion that some, if not 
all of them, are wrong. From the earliest age of reason, children should have 
some responsibility put upon them; some duty to perform, in which they can 
take pride. It is not kindness toward a child to indulge it, and firmness is a 
necessary part of love. Never deceive children. Be patient. Never allow 
temper to show when punishing children. Do not break promises to them, 
whether it be of reward or punishment.
